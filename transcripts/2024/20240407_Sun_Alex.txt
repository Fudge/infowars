[00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:06.925]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[00:00:12.986 --> 00:00:36.985]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:56.338]   www.infowars.com In 2021, the commander of Israeli intelligence published a book on designing a special machine that would resolve what he described as a human bottleneck for locating and approving targets in war.
[00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:11.735]  A recent investigation by Plus 972 Magazine and Local Call reveals that the Israeli Army has developed an artificial intelligence-based program known as Lavender, which does exactly that.
[00:01:12.435 --> 00:01:22.779]  According to six Israeli intelligence officers with first-hand experience, the Lavender AI machine determined who to kill and was obeyed with military discipline.
[00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:32.992]  During the first weeks of the war, the Lavender System designated about 37,000 Palestinians as targets and directed airstrikes on their homes.
[00:01:33.613 --> 00:01:40.522]  Despite knowing that the system makes errors about 10% of the time, there was no requirement to check the machine's data.
[00:01:41.423 --> 00:01:49.311]  The Israeli Army systematically attacked the targeted individuals at night, in their homes, while their whole family was present.
[00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:59.020]  An automated system known as, Where's Daddy?, was used to track the targeted individuals and carry out bombings when they entered their family's residences.
[00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:05.083]  The obvious result was that thousands of women and children were wiped out by Israeli airstrikes.
[00:02:05.623 --> 00:02:11.725]  According to these Israeli intelligence officers, the IDF bombed them in homes as a first option.
[00:02:12.225 --> 00:02:17.707]  And on several occasions, entire families were murdered when the actual target was not inside.
[00:02:18.387 --> 00:02:25.109]  In one instance, four buildings were destroyed along with everyone inside because a single target was in one of them.
[00:02:26.226 --> 00:02:37.389]  When it came to targets marked as low-level by the AI Lavender System, cheaper bombs were used, which destroyed entire buildings, killing mostly civilians and entire families.
[00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.952]  This was done because the IDF did not want to waste expensive bombs on who they deemed as unimportant people.
[00:02:45.712 --> 00:02:54.039]  It was decided that for every low-level Hamas operative that Lavender marked, it was permissible to kill up to 15 or 20 civilians.
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.484]  And if the target was a senior Hamas official, more than 100 civilians was acceptable.
[00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:04.228]  Most of these AI targets were never tracked before the war.
[00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:18.801]  The Lavender Software analyzed information collected on the 2.3 million residents of the Gaza Strip through a system of mass surveillance, assessed the likelihood of each person being a militant, and gave a rating from 1 to 100.
[00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:23.925]  If the rating was high enough, then they were killed along with their entire family.
[00:03:24.565 --> 00:03:35.695]  Lavender flagged individuals who had patterns similar to Hamas, including police, civil defense, relatives, and residents who had similar names and nicknames.
[00:03:36.375 --> 00:03:39.498]  This sort of tracking system has existed in the U.S.
[00:03:39.738 --> 00:03:40.319]  for years.
[00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:50.728]  What I will be providing you and the fine gentleman of the Secret Service is a list of every threat made about the President since February 3rd, and a profile of every threat maker.
[00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.722]  And these are, like, existing targets?
[00:03:56.583 --> 00:04:05.792]  Exhibit A. Oakland resident Justin Pinsky posted on a message board, Romania has a storied history of executing their leaders, couldn't they do us a solid and take out Bush?
[00:04:07.693 --> 00:04:08.714]  How is this all possible?
[00:04:09.675 --> 00:04:11.076]  Um, keyword selectors.
[00:04:11.797 --> 00:04:13.579]  Attack, take out, Bush.
[00:04:15.526 --> 00:04:23.711]  So think of it as a Google search, except instead of searching only what people make public, we're also looking at everything they don't, so... Emails, chats, SMS, whatever.
[00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:25.192]  Yeah, but which people?
[00:04:25.212 --> 00:04:27.833]  The whole kingdom's Snow White.
[00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:35.418]  And while many people claim that Israel controls the U.S., Joe Biden said that Israel serves U.S.
[00:04:35.538 --> 00:04:35.998]  interests.
[00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.000]  There's no apology to be made!
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.080]  None!
[00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:43.203]  It is the best $3 billion investment we make.
[00:04:44.571 --> 00:04:51.515]  Were there not an Israel, the United States of America would have to invent an Israel to protect her interest in the region.
[00:04:52.256 --> 00:04:54.977]  The United States would have to go out and invent an Israel.
[00:04:55.497 --> 00:04:58.497]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:58.497 --> 00:05:09.497]  [Music]
[00:05:09.497 --> 00:05:16.497]  [Music]
[00:05:16.497 --> 00:05:18.497]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:19.075 --> 00:05:21.457]  I am Chase Geyser filling in for the great Alex Jones.
[00:05:21.477 --> 00:05:22.617]  He'll be back at the end of the week.
[00:05:22.637 --> 00:05:27.280]  It's been a wild ride this past week, shifting all the hosts around for the different shows.
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.802]  It's always an honor and a pleasure to be with you.
[00:05:29.842 --> 00:05:34.084]  So we've got major escalations that have occurred all week.
[00:05:35.845 --> 00:05:44.250]  First, we have Blinky coming out and saying, affirmatively, assuredly, almost as a guarantee, that Ukraine will become a member of NATO.
[00:05:45.371 --> 00:06:02.469]   And For those of you who don't understand what this means is that all 32 or 33 nations involved, I think it would be 33 at that point, involved in NATO would be eligible legally, lawfully, on paper, to go to war with Russia.
[00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.032]  It would mean a hot war, World War III.
[00:06:07.372 --> 00:06:13.877]  We've got all this happening in conjunction with the conflicts between Israel and Gaza and the potential annexation of Taiwan.
[00:06:15.143 --> 00:06:21.027]  All that in the context of these mysterious earthquakes that have occurred in Taiwan and then in the Northeast here in the United States.
[00:06:22.368 --> 00:06:32.295]  All that in the context of reports coming out that the internet could be crashing at any time until 2025 because of solar weather, solar activity.
[00:06:32.315 --> 00:06:51.641]   The stage is being set, folks, for anything to happen and the Deep State is trying to Instill insurance policies in the psychology of the masses to guarantee that they can control the narrative and the psychological response of the people worldwide when everything seems to fall apart.
[00:06:53.542 --> 00:07:06.930]  And these stories that we hear of engines falling off of planes, doors flying off of planes, landing gear failing for planes, are a metaphor, a symbol of the entropy of our nation, our culture, our civilization itself.
[00:07:09.761 --> 00:07:10.941]  Yes, it's a fluke thing.
[00:07:11.261 --> 00:07:14.682]  Yes, these things happen every once in a while, but they don't happen all the time.
[00:07:14.942 --> 00:07:17.683]  You don't have emergency landings seemingly every other week.
[00:07:17.723 --> 00:07:18.603]  That's not normal.
[00:07:18.883 --> 00:07:22.164]  You don't have ships being hacked and crashing into bridges.
[00:07:22.785 --> 00:07:25.065]  Another one, a report somewhere in the stack on the desk.
[00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:29.206]  Happening this week, not a bridge crash, but a ship losing control.
[00:07:30.447 --> 00:07:34.188]  All of these pieces, it's just too much for coincidence.
[00:07:34.668 --> 00:07:38.929]  And like I said, I understand these things happen from time to time, but isn't it bizarre to you?
[00:07:40.247 --> 00:07:49.455]  That we're having massive cyber attacks, failures of direct deposits to major Fortune 500 companies, to their employees, from banks that are being hacked.
[00:07:50.515 --> 00:07:52.097]  We're having F-35s disappear.
[00:07:52.417 --> 00:08:01.665]  As soon as a spy balloon is caught over the United States and shot down, then we have massive oil leaks on Hawaii from the Space Force.
[00:08:02.025 --> 00:08:04.467]  All those oil leaks, of course, last February occurred.
[00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:11.725]  Within 24 hours of mysterious lasers being sighted from a Chinese satellite right over the facility.
[00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:16.249]  And then within six months of that, we have massive fires on the entire island.
[00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:27.037]  Then we have train derailments in East Palestine, resulting in massive exposure to the local community, to all sorts of insane chemicals, not to mention what happened to the water supply.
[00:08:27.577 --> 00:08:29.879]  Much worse than simply turning the frogs gay.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.224]  And then 60,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate disappearing.
[00:08:34.284 --> 00:08:36.266]  Oh, it must have just fallen out of the train.
[00:08:37.108 --> 00:08:46.159]  And that all in the context of the over 10 million people that have invaded the United States sponsored by the Biden administration since it came into power on January 20th of 2021.
[00:08:49.434 --> 00:08:57.420]  And if you don't think that these things are part of some coordinated conspiracy against the American people, against the world for that matter, then you should think again and look more closely.
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.803]  Because like I said, I understand that there is such a thing as an accident.
[00:09:01.843 --> 00:09:07.327]  I understand that there is such a thing as a bad administration or weak leadership and mistakes and incompetence.
[00:09:07.347 --> 00:09:12.590]  But it is to such an extent that I cannot fathom there isn't some sort of conspiracy behind this.
[00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.770]   I don't know anybody so incompetent that they would be able to make so many mistakes that
[00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:22.890]   are so convenient to the agenda of the deep state, of the national intelligence apparatus,
[00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:27.609]   the intelligence community here in the United States and worldwide for that matter.
[00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:33.330]   And it seems like every piece is accidentally falling into the perfect place to get us into
[00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:38.369]   a World War III because if we know one thing about globalism, what we know is that globalism
[00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:42.490]  cannot be achieved without global war.
[00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:46.809]   One world government cannot be achieved without one world war.
[00:09:47.502 --> 00:09:51.104]  And every time we've had a world war in the history of our species...
[00:09:52.483 --> 00:09:56.205]  The only ones of record that we're able to determine all happened within the last 100 years.
[00:09:56.245 --> 00:10:01.528]  I'm not suggesting that, but it seems likely at this point that maybe this isn't our first rodeo.
[00:10:01.988 --> 00:10:06.931]  Maybe this has happened 10, 15, 20 times over the last hundreds of thousands or millions of years.
[00:10:07.331 --> 00:10:12.394]  And the result is just that everything we ever thought we knew gets erased from the planet and we have to start over.
[00:10:14.104 --> 00:10:18.330]  The more I look into it, in Egypt, it seems likely to me that the Egyptians didn't build the pyramids.
[00:10:18.571 --> 00:10:21.295]  It seems likely to me that the Egyptians found the pyramids.
[00:10:21.816 --> 00:10:27.744]  That they existed before the Younger Dryas catastrophes on the planet 10,000 BC.
[00:10:30.666 --> 00:10:37.249]  And I really hope that that theory, that conspiracy, as fascinating as it is, isn't true.
[00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:48.734]  I really hope that this is our first rodeo because then that would mean that it's not our fate to repeat our past mistakes and erase our history and our species.
[00:10:49.974 --> 00:10:52.856]  I don't know if you've ever heard of the book, The Canticle of Leibowitz.
[00:10:52.896 --> 00:10:55.697]  It's either called The Canticle of Leibowitz or The Canticle for Leibowitz.
[00:10:56.457 --> 00:10:58.118]  But it's a famous science fiction novel.
[00:10:59.397 --> 00:11:01.239]  Basically it takes place at this monastery.
[00:11:01.259 --> 00:11:08.868]  There's this monk and they're looking at these old documents that are apparently specs for some electronic and circuit theory stuff.
[00:11:08.888 --> 00:11:09.609]  They don't know what it means.
[00:11:09.849 --> 00:11:11.150]  They're just copying these specs.
[00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:12.052]  They don't know what it means.
[00:11:12.132 --> 00:11:19.060]  And you find out that civilization has erased itself a number of times and does so on a cyclical basis.
[00:11:20.489 --> 00:11:28.936]  And if we don't wake up to it, if we don't realize that humanity is capable of its own self-destruction, then what are we supposed to do to prevent it?
[00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:31.719]  How can you solve a problem that you don't know exists?
[00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:35.322]  They say for alcoholics, the first step to getting better is admitting that you have a problem.
[00:11:36.377 --> 00:11:46.406]  Well, maybe for those with genocidal tendencies, maybe for our species, which is inclined to eradicate itself so much, the first step for us to prevent this to happen again is to admit that we have a problem.
[00:11:46.646 --> 00:12:08.344]   We have a problem that is the tendency to eradicate entire peoples no matter what, and the tendency for political systems To manifest that don't represent the interests of their own people, that sell the interests of their own people out to an international or global community, and that inevitably causes tremendous war and injustice, death, genocide, and hopefully not this time a mass extinction event.
[00:12:08.364 --> 00:12:09.865]  We're gonna run clip.
[00:12:11.087 --> 00:12:11.707]  One here in a second.
[00:12:11.727 --> 00:12:12.727]  I've seen this report on my desk.
[00:12:13.087 --> 00:12:13.908]  Death to America!
[00:12:13.988 --> 00:12:18.929]  Michigan protesters hold pro-Palestine rally, condemn Israel and the U.S.
[00:12:18.969 --> 00:12:27.571]  Michigan protesters were heard chanting death to America during a rally marking International Al-Quds Day in support of Palestine.
[00:12:27.611 --> 00:12:32.812]  Now, before we run the clip, I just want to say, if anybody wants to shout death to America, fine.
[00:12:32.892 --> 00:12:33.632]  Freedom of speech.
[00:12:34.272 --> 00:12:40.802]   But why is it that these people have found their way inside the borders of the United
[00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:41.452]  States of America.
[00:12:41.452 --> 00:12:44.412]   Why is it that this sentiment, this culture, this philosophy,
[00:12:44.412 --> 00:12:49.451]   these people are inside the United States? When I hear Iranians shout death to America,
[00:12:49.451 --> 00:12:52.893]   or Iraqis, or Afghanis, or terrorists in the Middle East, then I understand.
[00:12:52.893 --> 00:12:56.972]   Yeah, they hate us because of all of our crimes against humanity that have been committed in the
[00:12:56.972 --> 00:13:01.133]   region ever since we abandoned the gold standard and have been enforcing the petrodollar. I
[00:13:01.133 --> 00:13:06.492]   understand. Fine. But why is it that we open the door for those who hate us most to come
[00:13:06.492 --> 00:13:11.771]   into our country? Let's see the clip. We've been asked in the past,
[00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:20.013]   why are our protests on the International Day of Quds, why are they so anti-America?
[00:13:20.207 --> 00:13:23.992]  Why don't we just focus more on Israel and not talk so much about America?
[00:13:27.538 --> 00:13:32.659]  Gaza has shown the entire world why these protests are so anti-America.
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:39.381]  Because it's the United States government that provides the funds for all of the atrocities that we just heard about.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.979]   And this is why Imam Khomeini who declared the International Day of Quds,
[00:13:43.979 --> 00:13:52.480]   this is why he would say to pour all of your chants and all of your shouts upon the head of America.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:59.780]  [Chanting]
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.780]  With American made trucks in the background.
[00:14:01.459 --> 00:14:09.385]  Malcolm X said, and I quote, we live in one of the rottenest countries that has ever existed on this earth.
[00:14:09.565 --> 00:14:13.829]  It's not Genocide Joe that has to go, it's the entire system that has to go.
[00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:25.538]  Any system that would allow such atrocities and such devilry to happen and would support it, such a system does not deserve to exist on God's earth.
[00:14:26.057 --> 00:14:30.057]   And so when these fools ask us if Israel has the right to exist,
[00:14:30.057 --> 00:14:36.457]   the chant "Death to Israel" has become the most logical chant shouted across the world today.
[00:14:36.457 --> 00:14:42.256]  "Death to Israel!"
[00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:50.256]   Imam Khomeini recognized that Israel is an evil settler-colonialist project?
[00:14:50.472 --> 00:14:54.733]  He realized it is a cancer, and he established this day.
[00:14:55.053 --> 00:14:59.295]  Israel before this, brothers and sisters, was a sacred cow.
[00:15:00.375 --> 00:15:02.175]  Nobody could criticize Israel.
[00:15:02.556 --> 00:15:04.996]  Everybody was terrified of being anti-Semitic.
[00:15:05.336 --> 00:15:07.637]  Everybody was afraid of them.
[00:15:08.017 --> 00:15:12.898]  But now, the people of conscience very openly will criticize Israel.
[00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:15.259]  They recognize Israel for what it is.
[00:15:15.779 --> 00:15:17.600]  Israel is ISIS.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.441]  Israel are, they are Nazis!
[00:15:20.701 --> 00:15:21.821]  They are fascists!
[00:15:22.061 --> 00:15:22.942]  They are racists!
[00:15:22.962 --> 00:15:24.782]  The people of the world now know this!
[00:15:25.162 --> 00:15:26.043]  Free, free Palestine!
[00:15:28.964 --> 00:15:31.004]  Free, free Palestine!
[00:15:33.045 --> 00:15:34.966]  From the river to the sea!
[00:15:35.006 --> 00:15:37.466]  Palestine will be free!
[00:15:37.486 --> 00:15:39.367]  Palestine will be free!
[00:15:39.427 --> 00:15:41.688]  Well that's all happening in the United States of America and look!
[00:15:42.674 --> 00:15:45.857]  I'm not somebody who advocates for the actions of Israel.
[00:15:45.897 --> 00:15:48.960]  I don't think that genocide is acceptable under any circumstances.
[00:15:49.961 --> 00:15:52.844]  I think they are killing innocent people indiscriminately in Gaza.
[00:15:53.284 --> 00:16:04.194]  I also don't think that a two-state solution is going to work because I think the people on the Gaza Strip are so screwed up that it's not going to happen and there's no way that these two people are ever going to live at peace next to one another after all the terrible things that they've done to each other.
[00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:06.052]  No one is innocent here.
[00:16:06.372 --> 00:16:14.739]  We think of things in this country, in our culture, as good versus evil because that's the nature of the influence of Judeo-Christian values and stories on our mind.
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:25.929]  It's the nature of the influence of Hollywood on our minds, with every famous piece of literature that's American literature or American cinema always reinforcing the notion that every conflict is simply good versus evil.
[00:16:26.229 --> 00:16:44.219]  And that good always wins, and I believe that ultimately there is one conflict, that is good versus evil, and I believe that ultimately good will prevail over evil, but all of the miniature conflicts that occur in the scheme of that narrative, the great story of mankind, many of them are simply evil versus evil.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:53.794]   Whether it's Ukraine versus Russia, or whether it's Israel versus Gaza, It's very possible for two different evil entities to hate each other.
[00:16:53.814 --> 00:17:01.339]  I mean, just look simply at the fact that the vast majority of gun violence in the United States occurs black-on-black crime.
[00:17:02.079 --> 00:17:03.540]  Gang-on-gang violence.
[00:17:05.041 --> 00:17:06.822]  It's criminals versus criminals.
[00:17:07.623 --> 00:17:10.285]  It's not some good guy being gunned down by some bad guy.
[00:17:10.305 --> 00:17:12.606]  It's some bad guy being gunned down by some bad guy.
[00:17:12.966 --> 00:17:13.587]  Most of the time.
[00:17:14.545 --> 00:17:21.808]  Most of the evil that occurs in the world is actually evil versus evil and not good versus evil while good people stand idly by.
[00:17:21.828 --> 00:17:31.152]  And so the issue to me isn't whether or not Israel is right or whether or not Gaza is right, but what the heck is the United States doing involved in such conflicts?
[00:17:31.472 --> 00:17:41.716]  Why is it that we are incessantly finding ourselves involved in wars thousands upon thousands of miles away when we have thousands of politicians committing evil a hundred miles away?
[00:17:42.918 --> 00:17:53.566]  In our own capital, we have thousands of politicians committing evil atrocities on our own people, failing our own people, allowing protesters like that, who may actually be right in terms of the conflict between Israel and Gaza.
[00:17:53.586 --> 00:17:53.887]  I don't know.
[00:17:53.927 --> 00:17:55.348]  I think there's two sides to every story.
[00:17:55.368 --> 00:17:57.990]  I think both sides are probably right and wrong most of the time.
[00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:04.155]  I think October 7th was terrible, that it was perpetuated by terrorists from the Gaza Strip, and I think it was terrible that Israel allowed it to happen.
[00:18:04.735 --> 00:18:05.456]  They're both evil!
[00:18:06.196 --> 00:18:07.477]  Doesn't mean Jewish people are evil.
[00:18:07.677 --> 00:18:09.459]  Doesn't mean Muslim people are evil.
[00:18:09.739 --> 00:18:11.901]  But in that conflict, there weren't any good guys.
[00:18:13.547 --> 00:18:18.430]  So why is it that the United States would allow such sentiments to just flood across our borders?
[00:18:18.451 --> 00:18:19.611]  These people are not American.
[00:18:19.631 --> 00:18:21.172]  They don't have Western values.
[00:18:21.212 --> 00:18:24.455]  They don't have America in their heart or Americanism in their heart.
[00:18:24.735 --> 00:18:29.578]  It used to be that in the United States we were strong because people came over here and assimilated.
[00:18:29.618 --> 00:18:32.581]  We were never strong in the United States because of our diversity.
[00:18:32.621 --> 00:18:34.562]  We were always strong because of our assimilation.
[00:18:34.582 --> 00:18:38.405]  Whether you came over here from China, Germany, Ireland, England.
[00:18:39.651 --> 00:18:40.071]  Russia?
[00:18:40.171 --> 00:18:40.612]  I don't care.
[00:18:41.172 --> 00:18:41.912]  Any place in the world.
[00:18:41.972 --> 00:18:47.015]  When you came here, it used to be that you would come here to be American and you would assimilate with American values.
[00:18:47.275 --> 00:18:52.378]  Now we advocate for diversity instead of assimilation because somehow assimilation is cultural appropriation and wrong.
[00:18:52.879 --> 00:19:00.183]  We say diversity is our strength, but all we've done is put people right next to each other who refuse to share anything together and it creates this unnecessary conflict.
[00:19:00.891 --> 00:19:03.212]  Why is it that you would allow these people into the United States?
[00:19:03.452 --> 00:19:06.734]  That you would perpetuate this narrative against America?
[00:19:06.774 --> 00:19:15.138]  That you would allow the personification or the imagery that America itself is inherently evil, when it's not America that's evil, it's the United States.
[00:19:15.619 --> 00:19:25.504]  And it seems to me very obvious that it's a threat to our national security when we're simultaneously dumping 60,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate off of trains and admitting terrorists in this country.
[00:19:26.325 --> 00:19:30.606]  And I know that most of the migrants that come into this country are just trying to work hard and send money back to their families.
[00:19:30.886 --> 00:19:35.347]  But even the government itself admits that over 70,000 of them have been coming from terrorist-run countries.
[00:19:35.907 --> 00:19:40.788]  You don't think that any of those people have any terrorist sentiments with their shouting, death to America or from the river to the sea?
[00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:42.009]  I certainly do.
[00:19:42.469 --> 00:19:44.909]  But Joe Biden doesn't seem to think it's any of a problem.
[00:19:44.929 --> 00:19:46.770]  I want to run clip five here in a second.
[00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.311]  Biden doubles down on illegal immigration in Baltimore bridge speech.
[00:19:50.331 --> 00:19:51.151]  So he goes to the bridge.
[00:19:52.537 --> 00:19:58.461]  You know, which is a symbol of the failure of the Build Back Better propaganda that he was pushing.
[00:19:59.081 --> 00:20:03.004]  And instead of talking about the bridge, it seems like he really just wants to emphasize how awesome immigration is.
[00:20:03.024 --> 00:20:03.504]  Clip five.
[00:20:03.524 --> 00:20:08.728]  The damage is devastating and our hearts are still breaking.
[00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:13.631]  Eight, eight construction workers ran out of the water when the bridge fell.
[00:20:14.432 --> 00:20:16.313]  Six lost their lives.
[00:20:17.114 --> 00:20:19.155]  Most were immigrants, but all were Marylanders.
[00:20:19.977 --> 00:20:22.277]  Hard-working, strong, and selfless.
[00:20:23.078 --> 00:20:27.759]  After pulling a night shift fixing potholes, they were on a break when the ship struck.
[00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:35.020]  Just seconds before, one of the men named Paulo, who was only 24, left a message for his girlfriend.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:35.780]  Here's what it said.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.001]  We just poured cement.
[00:20:38.601 --> 00:20:40.901]  We're waiting for it to dry, he said.
[00:20:41.841 --> 00:20:45.142]  Well, all the families and loved ones were grieving.
[00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:47.354]  I've come here to grieve with you.
[00:20:47.494 --> 00:20:48.175]  We all are.
[00:20:48.876 --> 00:20:57.783]  It's not the same, but I know a little bit about what it's like to lose a piece of your soul, to get that phone call in the middle of the night to say, family members of God, I've been there.
[00:20:57.803 --> 00:21:03.488]  It's really like having a black hole in your chest, like you're being sucked in, unable to breathe.
[00:21:04.309 --> 00:21:08.613]  The anger, the pain, the depth of the loss is so profound.
[00:21:09.794 --> 00:21:11.936]  And we know it's hard to believe.
[00:21:12.642 --> 00:21:16.445]  You're probably not going to believe me, but I can tell you now from personal experience.
[00:21:17.166 --> 00:21:29.077]  The day is going to come when the memory of your loved one as you walk by that park or the church or something that you shared together is going to bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye.
[00:21:29.097 --> 00:21:31.139]  It's going to happen.
[00:21:31.359 --> 00:21:34.041]  It's going to take a while, but I promise you it will happen.
[00:21:34.282 --> 00:21:36.764]  And that's when you know you're going to be able to make it.
[00:21:37.585 --> 00:21:38.686]  I promise you it will come.
[00:21:39.474 --> 00:21:43.377]  Our prayers for you is that time comes sooner rather than later.
[00:21:43.777 --> 00:21:44.557]  But it will come.
[00:21:45.618 --> 00:21:48.800]  Also, never forget the contribution these men made to this city.
[00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:51.922]  We're going to keep working hard to recover each of them.
[00:21:52.883 --> 00:22:02.449]  And you know, my vow is that we will not rest, as Carlos said, until the cement has dried and the entirety of a new bridge.
[00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:03.650]  A new bridge.
[00:22:05.531 --> 00:22:06.592]  Unbelievable.
[00:22:07.586 --> 00:22:15.891]  It's not just Joe Biden who refuses to admit that we have a problem with immigration here, but we have the likes of Kimmel mocking concern over illegal immigrant murder in Michigan.
[00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:21.754]  So I can tell you anecdotal story after anecdotal story every single day.
[00:22:21.854 --> 00:22:32.420]  When we print all the news of the day that gets thrown on the desk here, there's always some immigrant beheading his wife or some immigrant stabbing his girlfriend or robbing someone or killing someone.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.821]  Or some immigrant being released.
[00:22:33.881 --> 00:22:37.683]  Or the immigrant that just committed a crime was just released for another crime and not deported from the United States.
[00:22:38.043 --> 00:22:41.445]  There are anecdotal stories all the time and I try not to go into it because it's just tiresome.
[00:22:41.785 --> 00:22:42.345]  It's old news.
[00:22:42.445 --> 00:22:43.466]  Everybody already knows.
[00:22:43.926 --> 00:23:05.750]   But then you have these people that come out and mock And it's not even the fact that there are opponents of the anti-illegal immigration push, the America First push that bothers me, but it's the insult to injury that's added by how pathetic these people are.
[00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:13.566]   You have to keep in mind folks that a major Part of why we are suffering so much in the United States.
[00:23:13.826 --> 00:23:24.571]  Why so many people in the United States have no idea what's going on and seem to make every wrong decision possible as it pertains to who they're going to vote for or support.
[00:23:25.768 --> 00:23:27.609]  It's because of these late night comedians.
[00:23:27.629 --> 00:23:35.591]  So if you are a person who gets your information exclusively from late night television, you are an idiot.
[00:23:36.151 --> 00:23:37.551]  You are a moron.
[00:23:38.191 --> 00:23:43.033]  I would like to use more explicit terms, but this is a family program and we're on the radio, so I'm not.
[00:23:43.433 --> 00:23:50.715]   But I just want to emphasize the fact that if you get your information I'm not just talking about news, but information, data, sentiments.
[00:23:51.436 --> 00:24:00.382]  From late night television alone, it's because you're a coward, you're weak, you're fat, you're a moron, you're stupid, and you're totally in denial.
[00:24:00.643 --> 00:24:01.723]  You are the problem.
[00:24:02.664 --> 00:24:05.906]  And you have your Kimmel's going up there with their smug looks.
[00:24:05.926 --> 00:24:09.029]  They have a team of writers that have to write for them because they can't even think for themselves.
[00:24:11.243 --> 00:24:26.372]  I'm not claiming to be an extraordinarily talented person or anything, but every single host on this platform, whether it's Harrison Smith, Alex Jones, Owen Schroer, myself, or any of the incredible guest hosts that we have on the show, they get up here and they talk for three hours with four-minute breaks every nine minutes or so.
[00:24:27.677 --> 00:24:28.237]  From the heart!
[00:24:28.357 --> 00:24:40.563]  And sometimes we make mistakes and get things wrong, and sometimes we get things really right, but it's authentic, it's true, it's from the heart, it's based on information that hasn't been coordinated, compiled, or suggested by a focus group.
[00:24:41.263 --> 00:24:46.663]   And so when you have a team of writers that are writing for you and they're ascribing to certain politically correct narratives because
[00:24:46.663 --> 00:24:49.403]   it's going to be placed on a major network and the major networks are all
[00:24:49.403 --> 00:24:52.763]   run by the intelligence community ever since project Mockingbird. That means that
[00:24:52.763 --> 00:24:57.583]   you have a political machine that is deceiving through entertainment the entire
[00:24:57.583 --> 00:25:00.493]   swaths of the American population and if they can't see it it's because
[00:25:00.493 --> 00:25:06.583]   they're fat and stupid weak cowardly empathetic. Look at Kimmel clip 6.
[00:25:06.583 --> 00:25:11.143]   Somehow in the middle of all these prosecutions Trump has been on the road
[00:25:11.143 --> 00:25:14.583]   doing rallies where you know when you think back on all the presidents there
[00:25:14.583 --> 00:25:18.463]   are so many great lines throughout history like yes we can tear down the
[00:25:18.463 --> 00:25:23.624]   wall the buck stops here and this new slogan from Trump stop Biden's border
[00:25:23.624 --> 00:25:28.508]   bloodbath Stop Biden's border bloodbath and beyond, in fact.
[00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:37.334]  He unrolled that one in Michigan, where the only border Michigan shares is with Canada, but why get bogged down with details?
[00:25:37.394 --> 00:25:47.141]  Trump has been very shamelessly trying to exploit the murder of a young woman in Michigan who was allegedly killed by a man she was dating, who also happened to enter the country illegally.
[00:25:47.181 --> 00:25:53.953]   This is the kind of story he loves, because It furthers the false narrative that immigrants commit more crimes here than Americans do.
[00:25:53.973 --> 00:25:59.244]  So he grabs on to this very sad story about this woman named Ruby to use it to get elected.
[00:26:00.109 --> 00:26:00.749]  Unbelievable.
[00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:07.332]  It's not even a matter of whether or not illegal immigrants commit more crimes or less crimes than Americans per capita.
[00:26:07.713 --> 00:26:08.733]  That's not even the point.
[00:26:09.013 --> 00:26:18.938]  The point is, it's more of an atrocity when a crime is committed by somebody who's not legally supposed to be here in the first place than it is when somebody who has the right to be here does it.
[00:26:19.929 --> 00:26:21.870]  Of course, when you're born here, you have the right to be here.
[00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.691]  Of course, if you're an American citizen, you have a right to be here.
[00:26:23.711 --> 00:26:25.671]  And there's going to be crimes that are going to be committed by our people.
[00:26:25.711 --> 00:26:29.133]  There's 350 million citizens or something like that in the United States.
[00:26:29.173 --> 00:26:30.513]  Of course, some of them are going to commit crimes.
[00:26:30.814 --> 00:26:41.038]  What's an atrocity is when the crime of invading our country is allowed by our political leaders, and then those people who come across into our country commit major crimes.
[00:26:41.638 --> 00:26:50.141]  But I don't care if 99.9% of them are great, outstanding people who are just a benefit to our labor force and just trying to help their families.
[00:26:50.281 --> 00:26:56.243]  If one out of a thousand of them commits a terrible crime, that is because our government failed us.
[00:26:57.423 --> 00:27:00.624]  Nobody's saying that all these migrants are terrible people or evil people.
[00:27:01.184 --> 00:27:05.906]  We're just saying that the systems in place are not filtering out the terrible, evil people among them.
[00:27:07.358 --> 00:27:11.159]  Is it too much to ask that we insist our government protect our borders?
[00:27:11.239 --> 00:27:14.400]  After all, isn't that the main point of a government in the first place?
[00:27:16.141 --> 00:27:20.002]  What purpose does a government serve if not to protect its people from outside threats?
[00:27:21.443 --> 00:27:25.704]  What need do we have for government at all if it's not going to protect our borders?
[00:27:27.386 --> 00:27:33.287]  Why are we focused on this argument that everybody deserves health care and health care is a national right or a human right?
[00:27:33.467 --> 00:27:42.049]  Why are we focused on every issue about whether a bridge is going to be built to replace the old bridge that went down and all the Build Back Better initiatives and the insulin costs and all the distractions?
[00:27:42.089 --> 00:27:50.770]  Why are they focused on everything except for the one main thing they're supposed to do, which is protect the people of America from outside threats and defend our rights against violation from our very own government?
[00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.111]  Something they failed to do for decade after decade.
[00:27:52.951 --> 00:27:56.151]  folks more on the other side.
[00:27:56.151 --> 00:28:03.951]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:02.014 --> 00:28:03.896]  I am Chase Geiser, your host this evening.
[00:28:04.436 --> 00:28:20.234]  We've got a lot of crazy stuff going on, so basically this show is going to merge straight into the Sunday Night Live show for about 30 minutes, and then we're going to play the interview from Owen Schroyer's new 30 Minutes podcast, which I like to say is half as long and twice as good as 60 Minutes.
[00:28:20.925 --> 00:28:34.455]  Owen is going to interview Holistic Health Lady, her name's Diane Kayser, who's made major discoveries in nanotechnology, founding cosmetics, female products, and dental products, and other things.
[00:28:34.475 --> 00:28:35.936]  And you're going to want to hear us.
[00:28:36.136 --> 00:28:44.202]  And she's going to be rejoining us this Wednesday, taking your calls on any health concerns and anything you hear in this interview.
[00:28:44.642 --> 00:28:50.082]   So if you want to call in and ask questions about the interview on Wednesday, You should stay tuned tonight for Sunday Night Live.
[00:28:50.102 --> 00:28:52.123]  We are going to run for the last hour or so of the show.
[00:28:53.044 --> 00:28:53.464]  Hour and a half.
[00:28:54.204 --> 00:28:56.205]  Clips of, if not actually the entire interview.
[00:28:56.826 --> 00:28:59.207]  And I believe it's longer than 30 minutes, but we'll see.
[00:29:00.188 --> 00:29:11.874]  And after that, we are going to debut another new 30 minutes where Owen sits down with an illegal immigrant child escort and explains how they are potentially being trafficked all around the country.
[00:29:11.914 --> 00:29:14.736]  So we've got some awesome content coming up this evening.
[00:29:15.116 --> 00:29:21.616]   Make sure that you stay tuned and Support the InfoWar.
[00:29:22.276 --> 00:29:29.361]  All right, so we've had so many claims about Russian influence on our politics, right?
[00:29:29.862 --> 00:29:36.927]  You remember back in 2016, there was Russian collusion for the election, and then it turned out that the Russian collusion allegations were just a hoax.
[00:29:36.967 --> 00:29:46.914]  We saw the framing and honeypotting attempts of the likes of George Papadopoulos, who wrote a great book called Deep State Target, had to be pardoned by Trump.
[00:29:47.657 --> 00:29:48.637]  We know that was all made up.
[00:29:49.217 --> 00:29:51.438]  Then we have the quid pro quo allegations.
[00:29:51.478 --> 00:29:52.778]  Now we have all these other allegations.
[00:29:52.798 --> 00:29:54.239]  It's always Russia, Russia, Russia.
[00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:56.239]  It's like Marsha, Marsha, Marsha from the Brady Bunch.
[00:29:56.259 --> 00:29:59.640]  It's Russia, Russia, Russia from this deep state.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:03.621]  Even though we've never had a hot war with Russia, we've never been in a conflict with Russia at all.
[00:30:03.661 --> 00:30:07.262]  Frankly, if it wasn't for Russia, we probably wouldn't have won World War II.
[00:30:09.326 --> 00:30:12.027]  We couldn't have defeated the Nazis without their help.
[00:30:12.067 --> 00:30:14.608]  But for some reason, they're just the greatest threat to humanity.
[00:30:14.628 --> 00:30:15.368]  They're so evil.
[00:30:15.388 --> 00:30:16.329]  They're so terrible.
[00:30:16.569 --> 00:30:17.349]  They're so atrocious.
[00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:24.532]  And then they try to brand Trump as the American version of Putin and Putin as the Russian version of Trump.
[00:30:24.712 --> 00:30:28.433]  They've merged the two figures together into one notion, one brand.
[00:30:28.593 --> 00:30:32.575]  They occupy the same space in the psychology of late-night television watchers.
[00:30:33.395 --> 00:30:33.956]  The country?
[00:30:34.636 --> 00:30:34.816]  Over.
[00:30:36.141 --> 00:30:51.885]  So whenever one's brought up, the other one is evoked or invoked, and whenever the other is brought up, the other one is evoked or invoked, and it's just obvious that it's this massive psyop against the psychology of the American people to create artificial enemies in order to justify the actions of a corrupt political elite.
[00:30:54.076 --> 00:30:54.716]  So watch this clip.
[00:30:54.736 --> 00:30:55.637]  This is clip four here.
[00:30:55.717 --> 00:31:00.199]  Rhino Mike Turner claims Russian propaganda has infected the GOP.
[00:31:00.499 --> 00:31:08.842]  This is House Intelligence Chair Mike Turner, Republican from Ohio, claimed that Russian propaganda has infected a portion of the GOP, the MAGA wing, more specifically.
[00:31:08.882 --> 00:31:21.767]  Now, I've talked about this at length, and we'll dive more into this, but the distinguishing of MAGA Republicans as terrorists away from this neocon movement is really, really insidious.
[00:31:21.807 --> 00:31:22.968]  Let's go ahead and run clip four first.
[00:31:24.192 --> 00:31:31.897]  Let's turn to Ukraine, an issue that's important to you and your fellow Republican chairman, Michael McCaul, who runs the Foreign Affairs Committee.
[00:31:32.417 --> 00:31:43.325]  Congressman McCaul made a comment this week about what he says sounds like Russian propaganda from some conservative media, and why it's so difficult to explain to Republican voters why supporting Ukraine is important.
[00:31:43.484 --> 00:31:48.844]   He told Julia Yaffe, "I think Russian propaganda has made its way into the United States, unfortunately,
[00:31:48.844 --> 00:31:51.604]  and it's infected a good chunk of my party's base."
[00:31:51.604 --> 00:31:54.323]  He singled out primetime shows on conservative channels.
[00:31:55.192 --> 00:31:56.233]  And how big is this problem?
[00:31:58.894 --> 00:32:00.394]  Oh, it is absolutely true.
[00:32:00.434 --> 00:32:10.558]  We see directly coming from Russia attempts to mask communications that are anti-Ukraine and pro-Russia messages, some of which we even hear being uttered on the House floor.
[00:32:10.578 --> 00:32:17.181]  I mean, there are members of Congress today who still incorrectly say that this conflict between Russia and Ukraine is over NATO, which of course it is not.
[00:32:18.182 --> 00:32:22.820]   Vladimir Putin having made it very clear, both publicly and to his own population, that
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:29.822]   his view is that this is a conflict of a much broader claim of Russia to Eastern Europe,
[00:32:29.822 --> 00:32:33.020]  including claiming all of Ukraine's territory as Russia's.
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:38.422]   Now, to the extent that this propaganda takes hold, it makes it more difficult for us to
[00:32:38.422 --> 00:32:42.942]   really see this as an authoritarian versus democracy battle, which is what it is.
[00:32:43.152 --> 00:32:46.735]  President Xi of China, Vladimir Putin himself have identified it as such.
[00:32:47.035 --> 00:32:48.456]  We need to stand up for democracy.
[00:32:48.496 --> 00:32:54.461]  We need to make certain that we know that authoritarian regimes never stop when they start an aggression.
[00:32:55.902 --> 00:32:59.645]  Ukraine needs our help and assistance now, and this is a very critical time for the U.S.
[00:32:59.665 --> 00:33:01.226]  Congress to step up and provide that aid.
[00:33:01.246 --> 00:33:02.567]  I tell you what, folks.
[00:33:03.055 --> 00:33:04.243]  I would much rather see.
[00:33:06.491 --> 00:33:13.635]  Europe occupied by orthodox Russians and Europe occupied by radical Islamic extremists, as it is now.
[00:33:13.895 --> 00:33:17.637]  So this whole notion, Russia's not going to stop at Ukraine, I'm thinking, thank God!
[00:33:19.458 --> 00:33:24.540]  What problem does Europe have right now that wouldn't be solved by a Russian occupation?
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.081]  I don't even like Vladimir Putin.
[00:33:26.461 --> 00:33:28.582]  I do think that he's a bit of a despot, to say the least.
[00:33:28.622 --> 00:33:33.545]  I do think that he's probably corrupt, making billions upon billions of dollars for himself because of his power.
[00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:37.227]   I do believe that he arrests Oppositional forces.
[00:33:38.007 --> 00:33:46.209]  And I do find it unlikely that over 80% of any populace would vote the same way for any candidate.
[00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:52.911]  I think that he's probably most popular, he's probably more popular than any of the other candidates that he ran against.
[00:33:52.951 --> 00:34:00.534]  I think he probably won the majority in the last election, but I find it very hard to believe that those election results were 100% accurate.
[00:34:00.554 --> 00:34:01.434]  Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know.
[00:34:02.875 --> 00:34:07.281]  But I also find it hard to believe that the election results in the United States are 100% accurate.
[00:34:07.801 --> 00:34:08.242]  Obviously.
[00:34:08.262 --> 00:34:14.390]  And I can't think of anything that Russia is doing or has done in recent years that the United States hasn't done itself.
[00:34:15.422 --> 00:34:17.303]  Oh, Navalny's dead, he's killing journalists.
[00:34:17.383 --> 00:34:19.984]  Okay, well what about the American journalist that died in a Ukrainian prison?
[00:34:20.324 --> 00:34:25.745]  Or what about the American journalist, Edward Snowden, who has to seek asylum in Moscow of all places?
[00:34:25.845 --> 00:34:26.946]  Okay, so, check.
[00:34:27.366 --> 00:34:28.426]  Oh, he's torturing people.
[00:34:28.546 --> 00:34:30.847]  Oh, torture's never been anything that we've done here in the United States.
[00:34:30.927 --> 00:34:37.369]  Oh, he's invaded a sovereign country for no reason in order to exacerbate his own or manifest his own political agenda.
[00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:39.390]  Oh, you mean we didn't do that in Iraq or Afghanistan?
[00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:40.910]  Oh, he's killing civilians in Ukraine.
[00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:44.408]   Okay, how about the 500,000 civilians that died in the Middle Eastern wars we've been in the last 20 years?
[00:34:44.408 --> 00:34:49.509]   Everything he's doing now is something the United States has done literally in the last several 20 years.
[00:34:49.509 --> 00:34:55.029]   Certainly for the majority of the time, all the time that Joe Biden's ever been in public office.
[00:34:55.029 --> 00:35:01.989]  I mean, NATO celebrated 75 years of existence this week.
[00:35:01.989 --> 00:35:08.538]   And I'm looking into it, I'm like, hey, somebody should ask Joe Biden what the world was like before NATO was
[00:35:08.538 --> 00:35:09.109]  established.
[00:35:09.209 --> 00:35:13.271]  He was like six years old, so he probably remembers what the world was like without NATO.
[00:35:13.291 --> 00:35:14.532]  That's how ancient this guy is.
[00:35:14.552 --> 00:35:21.215]  He's been involved in politics so long that every crime that's been committed since the beginning of the Cold War onward has been something that's been under his auspice.
[00:35:22.116 --> 00:35:23.856]  The auspice of his political career.
[00:35:25.497 --> 00:35:30.300]  And so you have them come out and say that we're fighting for democracy so much and saying that the Russian election was rigged.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.381]  Maybe it was rigged, but at least they had an election.
[00:35:33.464 --> 00:35:36.406]  Zelensky cancelled the election that was supposed to happen in March in Ukraine.
[00:35:36.446 --> 00:35:44.711]  I know it was legal, technically, for him to do so, given the fact that his country is being invaded, and I believe that the Ukrainian laws, in a way that don't exist in U.S.
[00:35:44.752 --> 00:35:49.054]  law, the Ukrainian laws allow for elections to be postponed in times of national emergency like that.
[00:35:49.094 --> 00:35:51.876]  So I'm not saying it was illegal, but it doesn't make it right.
[00:35:53.077 --> 00:35:57.500]  You would think that he would allow an election if he thought it would result in a success.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:58.821]  And let me put it to you like this.
[00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:05.721]  I don't believe that any politician would ever cancel an election that that politician believes he could win.
[00:36:06.863 --> 00:36:10.530]  Why would you ever cancel an election you were sure that you would win?
[00:36:12.386 --> 00:36:15.589]  Because if you're going to win an election, then it just reinforces your whole political platform.
[00:36:15.849 --> 00:36:17.831]  You can prove to the people that you have support.
[00:36:18.052 --> 00:36:21.395]  You can prove to the naysayers that actually the majority of your people do want you in office.
[00:36:21.695 --> 00:36:23.417]  It reinforces everything that you're trying to do.
[00:36:23.697 --> 00:36:28.982]  All it does is serve to reinforce and support your political agenda if you win an election.
[00:36:29.183 --> 00:36:36.350]  So to cancel an election, the only real reason to do that, the only politically expedient reason to do that, is if you believe that you're going to lose that election.
[00:36:37.861 --> 00:36:45.683]  So I put to you now that the only reason Zelensky canceled the election was not because they're in a state of emergency or they just don't have the infrastructure in place to hold an election.
[00:36:45.983 --> 00:36:47.784]  It's because they were not sure that he was going to win.
[00:36:48.064 --> 00:36:49.965]  They don't think that he's as popular as he used to be.
[00:36:50.245 --> 00:36:51.805]  They don't think that he would be reelected.
[00:36:52.065 --> 00:36:55.526]  Maybe the Ukrainian people would actually vote for someone else that would end the war.
[00:36:56.547 --> 00:37:01.188]  And our intelligence community certainly doesn't want anybody else in place because Zelensky is under their control.
[00:37:01.568 --> 00:37:08.524]   So why would they risk having to establish a relationship or compromise a new political figure that could be elected by an unpredictable Populous?
[00:37:09.224 --> 00:37:11.305]  When they could just cancel the elections and keep this one going on.
[00:37:11.325 --> 00:37:12.666]  You want to defend democracy?
[00:37:12.726 --> 00:37:15.586]  Trust me, we're doing anything but defend democracy.
[00:37:15.626 --> 00:37:17.427]  Frankly, we're not even supposed to be a democracy here.
[00:37:17.487 --> 00:37:18.888]  So you want to fight for democracy?
[00:37:18.908 --> 00:37:23.109]  Why don't you fix our own country before trying to fix all of the ales of the world, folks?
[00:37:23.149 --> 00:37:24.449]  More on the other side.
[00:37:24.489 --> 00:37:24.989]  Stick with us.
[00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.170]  So much news to get into.
[00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:34.170]  [Music]
[00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:37.170]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:37.518 --> 00:37:39.419]  I am Chase Geyser, your host this evening.
[00:37:39.439 --> 00:37:49.204]  It's an honor and a pleasure to be with you, as always, as we cover the insidious plans of the political class, domestic and worldwide, to conglomerate all world power and take over.
[00:37:49.224 --> 00:37:53.066]  We talked about this at length on the War Room Show on Friday.
[00:37:53.086 --> 00:37:56.568]  I was fortunate enough to have the privilege of being the guest host for the War Room.
[00:37:57.369 --> 00:38:00.631]  And I'm not worried about the New World Order or the globalists.
[00:38:01.707 --> 00:38:02.007]  Winning?
[00:38:02.247 --> 00:38:02.867]  I think we're going to win.
[00:38:02.887 --> 00:38:05.928]  I'm worried about how painful it's going to be to defeat them and challenging.
[00:38:06.368 --> 00:38:08.249]  And I'm fighting like hell to make sure it doesn't happen.
[00:38:08.309 --> 00:38:09.589]  Everything I know how to do.
[00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.810]  Part of me is just worried about what's going to happen as a response.
[00:38:15.411 --> 00:38:24.013]  So when we get all the power back, are we going to behave justly and bring these people to justice without committing atrocities ourselves?
[00:38:24.093 --> 00:38:24.453]  I don't know.
[00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:30.533]  But when you see stories like this, this is clip number nine, we're going to run in a second.
[00:38:30.573 --> 00:38:34.557]  This grandma is speaking out after being convicted for praying in the Capitol on January 6th.
[00:38:34.617 --> 00:38:38.500]  I don't know if you follow Jack Pasovic, he's one of my favorite influencers in the space.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.343]  I don't like to use the word influencer because it has a negative connotation.
[00:38:41.383 --> 00:38:43.825]  It's sort of been associated with grifting.
[00:38:43.865 --> 00:38:46.007]  He's not a grifter, he is the real deal.
[00:38:46.587 --> 00:38:49.810]  Incredible content, four years, and I highly recommend you check out his book on humans.
[00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:50.510]  I pre-ordered it.
[00:38:51.471 --> 00:38:53.500]   So if you haven't, Check that out yet.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:39:02.450]  It's got an awesome cover being published by Skyhorse, the same publisher that we use here at InfoWars for The Great Reset and The Great Awakening and my book coming out, The Rise of American Populism, as well.
[00:39:02.891 --> 00:39:04.412]  So check out Jack Posobiec.
[00:39:04.432 --> 00:39:07.516]  But he made me aware of this story this week.
[00:39:07.556 --> 00:39:10.019]  It's a story that I wish I had been aware of earlier on.
[00:39:10.279 --> 00:39:11.881]  I'm ashamed that I didn't know about this.
[00:39:11.921 --> 00:39:22.642]   This grandma, this lady, In her 70s, 71-year-old grandmother Rebecca Lorenz is facing a year in jail and $200,000 in fines for entering the Capitol to pray.
[00:39:23.222 --> 00:39:25.283]  She says, quote, I was there to stand up for my country.
[00:39:25.343 --> 00:39:32.246]  God led me to go there and into the building to stand up for my First Amendment rights, to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
[00:39:32.306 --> 00:39:33.986]  So we're going to run this clip 9.
[00:39:34.187 --> 00:39:41.469]  In the meantime, while we run this clip 9, if the crew could find the clip of this lady on Jack Posobiec's account, maybe, or just anywhere on Twitter.
[00:39:41.989 --> 00:39:42.930]  She was in her car.
[00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:47.955]  While the jury was deliberating to determine whether or not she was guilty.
[00:39:47.995 --> 00:39:49.957]  I think it took the jury three days to deliberate.
[00:39:49.977 --> 00:39:53.261]  We may want to run that too, but let's start with Clip 9 and see what she has to say.
[00:39:55.609 --> 00:39:58.891]  Well, 50 some years ago that the role of the government is for limited.
[00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:03.933]  It's only limited for fans of our country and roads are the only things I can remember.
[00:40:04.473 --> 00:40:07.235]  It wasn't all this infringement in every part of our life.
[00:40:07.355 --> 00:40:09.756]  And Jesus said he came to give us liberty.
[00:40:09.956 --> 00:40:11.737]  And he said to came to set us free.
[00:40:11.777 --> 00:40:20.572]   And I, I can't live my life out of my, out of my five acres and have chickens and I live my life and I've got to fight for that.
[00:40:20.592 --> 00:40:25.538]  You know, evil is going to prevail if we don't, if good men do nothing.
[00:40:25.778 --> 00:40:28.261]  And so I just felt like God said, you need to go.
[00:40:28.601 --> 00:40:31.184]  And he actually, I think you said what he said.
[00:40:31.224 --> 00:40:35.850]  I just remember I looked over, I spent a lot of time journaling, you know, so I can know I'm hearing God.
[00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:42.539]   And when I remember the thing that he, That he said is, Rebecca, this is going to be an adventure for you.
[00:40:43.159 --> 00:40:48.881]  And I know you want to live long and you're going to enjoy your life a lot longer if you go on this trip with me.
[00:40:49.201 --> 00:40:52.082]  And I'll be sitting in the passenger seat with you all the way.
[00:40:52.722 --> 00:40:59.164]  And I was excited to go and stand up for what I thought was a republic of we the people.
[00:41:00.425 --> 00:41:04.206]  And I feel like God chose me.
[00:41:05.566 --> 00:41:06.627]  I felt like God chose me.
[00:41:09.188 --> 00:41:14.119]  You've just been found guilty in a federal court on four misdemeanors up to three years in prison.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:17.907]  Would your father be proud of you today if he was here?
[00:41:18.962 --> 00:41:20.883]  Oh yes, he definitely would have been.
[00:41:21.884 --> 00:41:22.744]  I know he would have been.
[00:41:22.884 --> 00:41:24.045]  He stood for truth all the way.
[00:41:24.085 --> 00:41:24.685]  So did my mom.
[00:41:25.005 --> 00:41:28.927]  They taught me to stand for truth and that's the way I was brought in.
[00:41:28.947 --> 00:41:31.169]  It was just part of my DNA.
[00:41:31.769 --> 00:41:38.493]  I know my Heavenly Father is proud of me too because I obeyed Him to follow Him and do what He was asking me to do.
[00:41:38.873 --> 00:41:51.206]   If He wouldn't have told me, if He would have said don't go, I wouldn't have gone because I was a bigger purpose than And as I said, it's like God, country and my family.
[00:41:51.506 --> 00:41:54.668]  And I knew that my country was in really big trouble.
[00:41:55.649 --> 00:42:19.577]   You know, if we're going to have socialism, Marxism, communism and take God out of everything, killing babies in the womb and Those kind of things, then we don't, we're living in a godless society, and that's not what our country is founded on, and I believe God wants to make our country, I know Josh said before, glorious, and I've got a new maggot slogan, it's Make America God.
[00:42:20.257 --> 00:42:32.120]  Yeah, so, obviously terrible what she's facing, and I want to show you this next clip as well of her in the car, because I'm going to make a point about this type of injustice, right?
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.409]   We believe I believe I'm not alone here.
[00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:42.791]  America should not be a place where you need a pardon for a prayer.
[00:42:44.571 --> 00:42:45.332]  Pretty straightforward.
[00:42:45.952 --> 00:42:47.852]  You should never need a pardon for a prayer in America.
[00:42:47.872 --> 00:42:49.653]  I understand she entered the Capitol and prayed.
[00:42:50.013 --> 00:42:57.655]  But when you see this type of injustice, it evokes a maddening sense of retribution amidst good people.
[00:42:58.315 --> 00:43:00.315]  Let's go ahead and see the other clip.
[00:43:00.315 --> 00:43:08.315]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:43:08.315 --> 00:43:18.315]  So, what's the point of this?
[00:43:18.315 --> 00:43:28.315]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:43:28.315 --> 00:43:29.315]  It's weird to be here.
[00:43:29.315 --> 00:43:32.315]  Over three years ago, I was here.
[00:43:32.315 --> 00:43:36.315]  So, what's the point of this?
[00:43:35.891 --> 00:43:39.593]  When your country treats you like a terrorist, you're more likely to become a terrorist.
[00:43:40.313 --> 00:43:42.295]  When they treat you like a criminal, you're more likely to commit a crime.
[00:43:42.315 --> 00:43:48.298]  When they treat you like an insurrectionist, you're more likely to become an insurrectionist because it's unjust that they're treating you like that to begin with.
[00:43:49.235 --> 00:43:56.057]  And this type of thing is happening thousands and thousands of times over in thousands of different ways every single day.
[00:43:56.317 --> 00:44:02.339]  And we're seeing it go viral on the Internet, not just the new Free Speech X platform, but on the TikToks and the Instagrams, even the controlled platforms.
[00:44:02.379 --> 00:44:04.120]  People are waking up like, what the heck is going on?
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.520]  Why is this lady facing prison time?
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.361]  Because she walked into the Capitol during a protest to say a prayer.
[00:44:09.801 --> 00:44:11.122]  She's not breaking windows.
[00:44:12.344 --> 00:44:14.045]  Wrestling with cops, doing anything wrong.
[00:44:14.065 --> 00:44:17.506]  She was just there to stand up against a perceived injustice.
[00:44:17.526 --> 00:44:21.708]  It's irrelevant whether or not she was right in her protest, because you have the right to protest in this country.
[00:44:22.008 --> 00:44:24.849]  And then she's being shut down as a terrorist.
[00:44:24.869 --> 00:44:26.070]  And there's more examples of this.
[00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:27.911]  Clip 10, FBI whistleblower.
[00:44:28.631 --> 00:44:33.013]  The FBI taught agents that pro-lifers were more dangerous than Islamic terrorists.
[00:44:34.096 --> 00:44:42.459]  We were shown a video that was produced by the Southern Poverty Law Center that ranked people who oppose abortion pro-life activists as a greater threat than Islamists.
[00:44:42.479 --> 00:44:53.883]  The FBI trained counterterrorism personnel with Southern Poverty Law Center, SPLC, materials claiming conservatives were more of a threat than Islamic terrorists, according to former FBI agent turned whistleblower Steve Friend.
[00:44:53.903 --> 00:44:56.304]  Let's watch a little bit of that.
[00:44:57.011 --> 00:45:01.412]  When it comes to Christians, oh well, if they're a Christian, we're really going to have to watch them.
[00:45:01.432 --> 00:45:04.793]  We can legitimize in our mind investigating them.
[00:45:06.813 --> 00:45:20.276]  At the SBI Academy, we were shown a video that was produced by the Southern Poverty Law Center in which they ranked people who oppose abortion, pro-life activists, as a greater threat than Islamists.
[00:45:21.192 --> 00:45:24.755]  That's the training that went on for me, and that was in 2014, so 10 years ago.
[00:45:24.815 --> 00:45:29.119]  I don't know if they still show that, but that was what we were shown.
[00:45:29.459 --> 00:45:36.185]  And I think that it's also worth knowing that, back to the words, I said, you know, Christian nationalists, the term doesn't matter.
[00:45:36.205 --> 00:45:44.012]  The FBI reinterprets what terms mean all the time to push a political agenda, which is why we'll take something like January 6th.
[00:45:44.993 --> 00:45:49.256]  Where they departed from the rules on that, which is what I was a whistleblower about.
[00:45:49.336 --> 00:45:54.860]  Where that's one case investigated with however many subjects committed or alleged to have committed a crime.
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.382]  The FBI opened a separate case for every single person.
[00:45:59.904 --> 00:46:02.345]  So now we've turned one case into thousands of cases.
[00:46:02.365 --> 00:46:03.326]  Wow.
[00:46:03.386 --> 00:46:07.329]  And then, instead of investigating them on paper from Washington, D.C.
[00:46:07.409 --> 00:46:08.630]  There's a task force in D.C.
[00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:09.890]  that's doing the investigating.
[00:46:10.902 --> 00:46:12.704]  They assigned them to the field, though.
[00:46:13.204 --> 00:46:21.393]  So, in Daytona, where I was, it now looks like there's a domestic terrorist in Daytona Beach when it's someone who walks through the Capitol.
[00:46:21.834 --> 00:46:30.323]  Another manipulation, though, is most of those cases are riot investigations, according to the way that they're categorized by the FBI.
[00:46:31.608 --> 00:46:33.552]  Rioting is a criminal violation.
[00:46:33.713 --> 00:46:36.298]  It's not a counter-terrorism matter.
[00:46:36.999 --> 00:46:38.462]  But the FBI is saying that they are.
[00:46:39.043 --> 00:46:42.991]  They're calling in that so they can call them terrorist cases.
[00:46:43.857 --> 00:47:07.184]  So, again, we're seeing that it doesn't matter what the term is, they will do whatever they have to and interpret the words in any way they can to call things domestic terrorism, because the demand for domestic terrorism vastly outstrips the supply that we have in this country, which theoretically should be a good thing, and you should be addressing... So, they want to define you as a domestic terrorist because then all the laws and implications change with the rights that you have.
[00:47:07.605 --> 00:47:08.545]  They go after you.
[00:47:09.761 --> 00:47:12.282]  Whatever they want, you're suddenly an enemy of the state.
[00:47:12.822 --> 00:47:20.606]  And when they do that to people like this unfortunate grandma that we just covered, everybody knows that it's wrong, even if they disagree.
[00:47:20.646 --> 00:47:28.849]  I mean, people look at that woman crying in their car, and only the coldest, most corrupted, evil people would say, well, she shouldn't have gone into Capitol.
[00:47:28.889 --> 00:47:30.110]  That is just asinine.
[00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:38.173]  If it was somebody that went into Capitol to pray and protest against Trump, I'd disagree and think that was silly, but I wouldn't advocate this person be put away for years.
[00:47:39.653 --> 00:47:41.775]  We got more great news to cover over the next hour or so.
[00:47:41.795 --> 00:47:43.416]  We're going to be taking calls in about 30 minutes.
[00:47:43.456 --> 00:47:46.418]  Make sure in the meantime you visit InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:47:46.458 --> 00:47:48.920]  I highly recommend checking out Survival Shield X3.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:49.881]  I did a bunch of research.
[00:47:50.241 --> 00:47:54.024]  The benefits of iodine are absolutely incredible.

[00:49:08.396 --> 00:49:19.077]  What the f*ck is that?
[00:49:19.051 --> 00:49:24.614]  Some are saying that directed energy weapons are being deployed to spark the largest fire in Texas history.
[00:49:25.035 --> 00:49:26.696]  And we know that these weapons exist.
[00:49:26.976 --> 00:49:32.399]  This newly released footage shows the Dragonfire Laser Directed Energy Weapon System in action.
[00:49:32.719 --> 00:49:35.921]  And it could be in the hands of military personnel in five years' time.
[00:49:36.321 --> 00:49:40.443]  It destroys targets with an intense beam of light and has pinpoint accuracy.
[00:49:40.784 --> 00:49:44.646]  It's able to hit something the size of a one-pound coin from a kilometer away.
[00:49:45.146 --> 00:49:51.933]  The fires we have seen in recent years, including the fires in Texas, are very different from what we have seen in the past.
[00:49:52.434 --> 00:49:58.680]  They often selectively spare the trees while burning the infrastructure into a powdery ash footprint.
[00:50:00.484 --> 00:50:04.928]  Witness and observed some extraordinary damage in our state.
[00:50:05.748 --> 00:50:17.598]  Could be caused by hurricanes or tornadoes and frequently when you see the aftermath of that damage, there's a some semblance of a structure that is still there.
[00:50:19.639 --> 00:50:25.444]  When you look at the damages that have occurred here, it's just gone.
[00:50:26.785 --> 00:50:27.665]  Completely gone.
[00:50:28.766 --> 00:50:29.387]  Nothing left.
[00:50:30.376 --> 00:50:31.877]  But ashes on the ground.
[00:50:32.997 --> 00:50:42.541]  After the Maui fires, many people believed that a blue roof was able to deflect these directed energy weapons and spare the home from destruction.
[00:50:43.122 --> 00:50:46.103]  And Joe Biden recently alluded to this twice.
[00:50:46.503 --> 00:50:55.287]  If you fly over these areas that are burned to the ground, you'll see in the midst of 20 homes that are just totally destroyed, one home sitting there because it had the right roof on it.
[00:50:56.047 --> 00:51:01.631]   And anyway, by the way, You notice you're flying over in a helicopter?
[00:51:01.671 --> 00:51:03.572]  Those places have good roofs.
[00:51:03.612 --> 00:51:04.053]  They did good.
[00:51:04.113 --> 00:51:06.474]  It's the right material.
[00:51:06.555 --> 00:51:06.955]  Yeah.
[00:51:06.975 --> 00:51:08.196]  So we gotta change that.
[00:51:09.804 --> 00:51:13.707]  Joe Biden is clearly not a reliable source of accurate information.
[00:51:14.007 --> 00:51:16.749]  But why would a roof save a house from burning?
[00:51:17.229 --> 00:51:27.957]  And while there is plenty of circumstantial evidence that suggests directed energy weapons are being used to start these recent fires, arsonists have been arrested starting them the old-fashioned way.
[00:51:28.478 --> 00:51:29.699]  And there is a clear motive.
[00:51:30.219 --> 00:51:42.366]   The United Nations, who have been orchestrating the open border policy of America and several other countries, Have openly announced plans to clear the lands of people and move them into smart cities.
[00:51:43.186 --> 00:51:50.748]  Starting with Agenda 21, a map which shows designated off-limits to human areas, lined up with the 2008 California fires.
[00:51:53.229 --> 00:51:57.631]  Nine years ago, planning was announced for smart cities to be built on Maui.
[00:51:58.211 --> 00:52:06.455]  But the most coveted property was owned by natives, whose families have lived there for generations prior to Hawaii being annexed by the U.S.
[00:52:07.336 --> 00:52:12.158]  In August of 2023, Maui was devastated by highly suspicious fires.
[00:52:12.698 --> 00:52:16.280]  Roads were blocked off to keep residents from escaping, and the U.S.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.801]  government gave survivors a mere $700 per household.
[00:52:20.902 --> 00:52:32.706]  A conference in April of 2023 met in Viña del Mar, Chile, to provide the municipality with support in the transfer of knowledge about the theory and solutions of smart cities.
[00:52:33.427 --> 00:52:36.808]  A year later, Viña del Mar was ravaged by fires.
[00:52:37.348 --> 00:52:41.430]  It was blamed on climate change, but local officials claimed arson.
[00:52:43.011 --> 00:52:52.337]  And in 2022, Amarillo, Texas was reported to be the number one area under the radar for the Texas housing market under the United Nations' Vision 2045.
[00:52:52.697 --> 00:52:59.902]  On February 26th of this year, the biggest fire of Texas broke out in this same area.
[00:53:00.722 --> 00:53:08.568]  Vision 2045 is the latest iteration of the United Nations' plan to seize control of 90% of the land and limit people to 15-minute cities.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:15.942]  I'd like to think that change happens in manageable ways.
[00:53:16.363 --> 00:53:17.624]  It doesn't happen like that.
[00:53:17.924 --> 00:53:26.350]  It happens in punctuated equilibria where we have periods of stability and then periods of massive, radical, disruptive and transformative change.
[00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:29.132]  And that is where we are right now.
[00:53:29.652 --> 00:53:32.494]  This is the decisive decade in the history of humanity.
[00:53:32.735 --> 00:53:36.497]  We who are here now have a responsibility that no future generations will carry.
[00:53:38.539 --> 00:53:41.499]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:54:06.378 --> 00:54:08.378]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, folks.
[00:54:08.591 --> 00:54:10.192]  I am Chase Geiser, your host this evening.
[00:54:10.252 --> 00:54:11.433]  Alex will be back at the end of the week.
[00:54:11.453 --> 00:54:18.017]  He is taking a much-deserved vacation, and he has been communicating with the crew this entire time and working closely.
[00:54:18.037 --> 00:54:21.780]  It seems like it's hard for him to get away from work, but I'm glad that he's able to get some time away with family.
[00:54:22.699 --> 00:54:23.319]  He will be back.
[00:54:23.719 --> 00:54:26.460]  Tomorrow we're going to be doing some coverage of the eclipse.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:32.782]  I'm not sure if the weather's going to be overcast or not, but we're going to have some cameras coming from several different locations around Austin, Texas.
[00:54:33.362 --> 00:54:39.644]  And I will be at Zilker Park as far as I know now with some of the crew interviewing people, getting responses for the eclipse.
[00:54:39.664 --> 00:54:43.545]  The eclipse is going to be at about 1.30 tomorrow as I understand it.
[00:54:43.585 --> 00:54:46.625]  So we'll be covering it between 1 and 2 central time.
[00:54:46.946 --> 00:54:54.430]   So tune in for that and we will be At several different locations, as I said, to make sure that we can try to get the best images to you of this eclipse.
[00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:56.331]  Apparently it's going to be amazing.
[00:54:56.712 --> 00:55:00.094]  I've never seen an eclipse that I thought was just mind-blowing before.
[00:55:00.114 --> 00:55:05.478]  I think the last time I spent time actually looking at one was probably in elementary school or something like that.
[00:55:05.538 --> 00:55:08.420]  So I'm excited as an adult to have this experience and look at it.
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:13.963]  Matt Baker was kind enough to call and tell me a little bit about the eclipse and how beautiful they really are.
[00:55:14.964 --> 00:55:26.432]  If you see the total eclipse and have the experience and are able to see the corona so we're gonna take his advice and do everything that we can to get the best Best imagery for you guys as possible if you're not in the strip.
[00:55:26.472 --> 00:55:26.872]  It's crazy.
[00:55:26.912 --> 00:55:41.309]   I saw a map this week of Airbnb bookings and There's just an insane amount of bookings along the the stretch that's gonna have the total eclipse in the United States very stuff so Let's get into this next story here.
[00:55:41.590 --> 00:55:44.838]  NATO Chief, Ukraine may have to compromise with Russia.
[00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:53.093]  So, it is up to the West to make sure that Kiev reaches an acceptable result, says Jens Stoltenberg.
[00:55:53.593 --> 00:56:02.178]  Ukraine may ultimately have to agree to come to some kind of compromise with Russia to end the conflict, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said.
[00:56:02.198 --> 00:56:14.165]  In an interview with the BBC published on Saturday, the NATO chief reiterated that the West must support Ukraine in the long term, even if we believe and hope that the war will end in the near future.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:22.982]  He added that Western countries should invest in Kiev's defense capabilities to make it more resilient in the event of future hostilities.
[00:56:23.022 --> 00:56:29.244]  At the same time, he signaled that it was up to Ukraine to choose when and under what conditions to seek peace with Russia.
[00:56:29.864 --> 00:56:35.346]  The end of the day, it has to be Ukraine that decides what kind of compromises they're willing to do, Stoltenberg said.
[00:56:36.986 --> 00:56:45.074]   So we know that this week, Blinken came out and explicitly stated that Ukraine will be a member of NATO.
[00:56:45.755 --> 00:56:59.426]  And we know that if this happens in the context of attacks from Russia on Ukraine, then those attacks would legally in the international community be classified as attacks on the United States itself and other members of NATO.
[00:57:00.526 --> 00:57:07.992]  This, then, justifies legally an explicit military response against Russia among all members of NATO, NATO members.
[00:57:11.877 --> 00:57:13.418]  So it seems like a major escalation.
[00:57:13.458 --> 00:57:25.369]  Now it's possible that this effort is being done so that Ukraine will have a better negotiating position in light of a surrender or a ceasefire or something of that nature.
[00:57:25.389 --> 00:57:26.690]  I don't know if they would call it a surrender.
[00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:29.853]  They'd probably try to save a face for Ukraine in this.
[00:57:30.373 --> 00:57:42.125]   But it seems to me just as likely, especially since we have conflicts popping up all over the place, that this is being used as an excuse to usher in Military action, NATO military action against Russia.
[00:57:42.145 --> 00:57:50.030]  And I saw a clip this week, I don't know if you guys saw the clip or if we have it, of NATO troops being spotted on a farmer's land in Moldova.
[00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:53.452]  And this farmer is yelling at them, get off my property, get off my property.
[00:57:53.472 --> 00:57:54.693]  They sounded like Americans to me.
[00:57:55.452 --> 00:57:57.894]  They responded and they said, we're here to help, we're here to help.
[00:57:57.954 --> 00:57:58.995]  And this guy knows better.
[00:57:59.015 --> 00:58:01.137]  He's like, look, you guys aren't here to help.
[00:58:01.778 --> 00:58:06.002]  Even if you think you're here to help, it's not very helpful that NATO is on my land.
[00:58:06.682 --> 00:58:12.648]  Because that can only mean that there's going to be increased escalation, conflict in the region.
[00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:16.352]  There's no way that this is going to be helpful.
[00:58:18.058 --> 00:58:19.139]  If NATO is involved.
[00:58:19.539 --> 00:58:20.920]  And Russia doesn't give up.
[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:21.901]  They don't care.
[00:58:22.201 --> 00:58:31.769]  All the way back to Napoleon, through World War II, through every military conflict that they've ever had, even when their whole entire government collapses, Russia still finds a way to stay Russia.
[00:58:32.455 --> 00:58:39.219]  I mean, what other example throughout history has there been the entire collapse of a government and that government, that country still remains?
[00:58:39.239 --> 00:58:45.823]  I know that the territories were redrawn after the collapse of the USSR or the Soviet Union, but Russia still managed to stay Russia.
[00:58:45.843 --> 00:58:47.264]  I was talking to my wife about Russia.
[00:58:47.284 --> 00:59:06.226]   One of the things that's the most amazing thing about Russia to me, the reason I respect Russians so much, is because while Russians seem to have failed to figure out how to really thrive, They are by far the most impressive people that I've ever seen figure out how to survive.
[00:59:07.587 --> 00:59:22.236]  They have survived Ivan the Terrible, they survived the collapse of the USSR in the midst of the Cold War, they survived both World War I and World War II, they survived the communist takeover and the eradication of the czar system that they had before.
[00:59:22.256 --> 00:59:33.931]   I mean, these people, despite all odds, being in a terribly unforgiving climate, Through terribly unforgiving times, you simply can't kill them.
[00:59:34.372 --> 00:59:35.873]  They will survive, no matter what.
[00:59:35.913 --> 00:59:45.523]  So if we think that we're going to have some sort of a victory over Russia in World War III, we should probably think again, because though they seem to struggle to thrive, they will survive.
[00:59:46.163 --> 00:59:49.347]  The opposite example would be like Rome, for example.
[00:59:49.667 --> 00:59:53.471]  Rome couldn't figure out how to survive, but at its peak, man, it was really thriving.
[00:59:54.582 --> 00:59:59.087]  It's yet to be said for the United States of America, but it seems that we may be failing to survive.
[00:59:59.327 --> 01:00:01.109]  But at our peak, man did we thrive!
[01:00:01.329 --> 01:00:04.432]  Did we accomplish some of the most impressive things that have ever been accomplished.
[01:00:05.373 --> 01:00:07.916]  From the Industrial Revolution all the way to the tech boom.
[01:00:08.316 --> 01:00:10.599]  From the invention of the internet, from landing on the moon.
[01:00:12.773 --> 01:00:18.416]  It's just the proof that capitalism and free markets are the most efficient form of an economy.
[01:00:18.656 --> 01:00:27.442]  The proof that trusting people with the responsibility of freedom amounts to less injustice than a top-down regulation.
[01:00:27.842 --> 01:00:36.287]  As this great experiment, we have proven objectively to the world that freedom is safer than safety is without freedom.
[01:00:37.492 --> 01:00:38.673]  It's an amazing accomplishment.
[01:00:38.713 --> 01:00:48.499]  I don't know if we're going to figure out how to survive or not because it seems like though our Constitution was capable of saying which rights should be protected, it failed to protect itself.
[01:00:49.359 --> 01:00:54.443]  It seems that our Constitution now has somehow just become another piece of paper.
[01:00:54.563 --> 01:00:56.324]  So it doesn't enforce itself.
[01:00:56.364 --> 01:01:02.908]  It requires good men with consensus on culture and values to enforce its principles.
[01:01:04.622 --> 01:01:14.053]  But it did prove that the principles within it, when they were actually manifest and being enforced and used to the best of our ability, were the most effective and just.
[01:01:14.413 --> 01:01:20.612]   The best at bringing the weakest and poorest among us up from poverty, the class transitions,
[01:01:20.612 --> 01:01:25.251]   the ascension from poverty to wealth that was possible in this country because of freedom
[01:01:25.251 --> 01:01:28.271]   is something that was just unprecedented and you hadn't seen anywhere else in the world.
[01:01:28.271 --> 01:01:33.913]   We proved that freedom is the way, though we did not yet discover, seemingly have not
[01:01:33.913 --> 01:01:37.291]  yet discovered, how we can protect freedom.
[01:01:37.291 --> 01:01:40.132]  That's one of my criticisms of anarchy.
[01:01:40.137 --> 01:01:54.573]  One of my big beefs with anarchy is like, okay, so if you establish a system of anarchy where there is no government and there's just total freedom, then what system or party is in place to enforce the state of anarchy?
[01:01:55.174 --> 01:01:56.235]  That's the issue with anarchy.
[01:01:57.015 --> 01:01:58.897]  There is no government to enforce anarchy.
[01:01:58.917 --> 01:02:02.319]  And if there was a government to enforce anarchy, then it wouldn't be anarchy because it would have a government.
[01:02:02.519 --> 01:02:06.162]  That's the major problem with anarchy as a political philosophy.
[01:02:06.502 --> 01:02:07.183]  It's impossible.
[01:02:07.243 --> 01:02:12.867]  And if you think about the history of mankind as a whole, the species itself, that is the default setup.
[01:02:12.907 --> 01:02:19.652]  The default setup is you're born into nature and there is no establishment, there's no system, there's no culture.
[01:02:19.712 --> 01:02:23.415]  If you're going back hundreds of thousands of years or however many thousands of years, go back for people.
[01:02:25.343 --> 01:02:34.873]  There was no system, but every single civilization, every society, every race, every religion, every culture, manifest and created a system to run itself under.
[01:02:34.893 --> 01:02:46.124]  Whether it was a despotism, whether it was a communism, whether it was a capitalism, or a kingdom, whatever, dictatorship, senate, all these different systems all spontaneously manifest.
[01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:51.950]   to create some sort of a government for a people based off of their consensus, their values and their culture.
[01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:56.450]   So anarchy, being the default state, is not a state that stays.
[01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:59.450]  It's something that gets washed out with the system.
[01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:02.950]   So if we were to establish some sort of an anarchy here in the United States,
[01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:08.620]   where there was no government, there was total freedom, then you would have people working and conspiring together
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:11.450]   for resources, and all of a sudden you have this tribal thing,
[01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:15.890]   and there's just different miniature governments, and the strongest will survive until the weakest are
[01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:18.950]   dominated or conquered, and then you wind up with a government again.
[01:03:19.396 --> 01:03:21.538]  It's just not a sustainable government.
[01:03:23.703 --> 01:03:30.966]  And so, what we have to figure out here, in the United States of America, is not what freedoms we should have.
[01:03:31.026 --> 01:03:32.207]  We already know the answer to that.
[01:03:32.247 --> 01:03:34.788]  The answer to that was given to us in the Constitution.
[01:03:35.168 --> 01:03:46.933]  Because our founders were thoughtful enough to actually consider the principles from the Second Treatise of Government by John Locke and others, and understand that here are a list of the ones we know are absolutely important.
[01:03:46.973 --> 01:03:49.535]  Things like freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to bear arms.
[01:03:50.755 --> 01:03:54.237]  Right to privacy, so you can't be searched and seized without warrant.
[01:03:55.097 --> 01:03:57.518]  And others, they were able to make a non-comprehensive list.
[01:03:57.598 --> 01:03:59.219]  A list that they knew was non-comprehensive.
[01:03:59.239 --> 01:04:00.660]  They look, this is not an exhaustive list.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:05.722]  There are the rights that aren't listed here, but these are the ones that we know for sure need to be protected with this Bill of Rights or with these amendments.
[01:04:06.422 --> 01:04:08.743]  We know the answer to what freedoms need to be protected.
[01:04:08.763 --> 01:04:21.615]   What we have not figured out as a species, as a culture specifically here in America, is how we can ensure a system that will always protect those freedoms.
[01:04:21.615 --> 01:04:27.375]   We can establish a system that will protect those freedoms, but over time, like a used car or an old computer,
[01:04:27.375 --> 01:04:28.894]  it just doesn't work like it used to.
[01:04:28.894 --> 01:04:32.416]   Things fall through the cracks and then the whole machine dies down,
[01:04:32.416 --> 01:04:33.856]  you got to reset.
[01:04:33.856 --> 01:04:37.056]   I don't like to use the word reset because we know who's associated with the great reset.
[01:04:37.056 --> 01:04:38.815]  But it's a fact of the matter.
[01:04:38.815 --> 01:04:44.896]   And we saw a progression where it actually got better for a while
[01:04:44.896 --> 01:04:46.016]  and then it started to get worse.
[01:04:46.016 --> 01:04:48.495]  So we established this country, 1776.
[01:04:48.495 --> 01:04:52.016]   We have the establishment of the Constitution with the Bill of Rights,
[01:04:52.016 --> 01:04:55.855]   the end of the 18th century, after the Articles of Confederation failed.
[01:04:55.855 --> 01:05:00.815]   You can argue whether or not they actually failed, but after the Articles of Confederation were abolished.
[01:05:00.815 --> 01:05:05.535]   And for 100 years, We're going to be back in a little bit.
[01:05:04.776 --> 01:05:11.879]  We went from a nation that had things like slavery closer and closer to a nation that wouldn't have things like slavery.
[01:05:11.899 --> 01:05:18.821]  We went from a nation that didn't allow people of different races or genders to vote to a nation that did.
[01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:25.584]  It's like our freedoms got better and better until some pivotal moment where they started to get worse again.
[01:05:25.624 --> 01:05:29.686]  And I really attribute it to the advent of the creation of the Federal Reserve.
[01:05:30.266 --> 01:05:38.511]   As soon as we had the centralized fractional reserve banking, And especially when we went off the gold standard, that's when everything seemed to fall apart.
[01:05:39.132 --> 01:05:40.212]  What was it, 1913 or 1917?
[01:05:40.272 --> 01:05:41.613]  I always mix them up.
[01:05:41.653 --> 01:05:45.476]  I think it was 1913 that we established the Federal Reserve, a little over 100 years ago, 110 years ago.
[01:05:46.456 --> 01:05:56.683]  Same time we established the income tax, which many of you may not know was thought to be unconstitutional before we amended the Constitution to allow the income tax.
[01:05:59.085 --> 01:06:01.026]  We established this income tax that was originally 1%.
[01:06:01.586 --> 01:06:06.138]   You can go back and look at Either Theodore Roosevelt's or FDR's first tax returns.
[01:06:06.198 --> 01:06:06.958]  It's public information.
[01:06:06.978 --> 01:06:07.638]  It's like one page.
[01:06:07.678 --> 01:06:09.478]  He's doing the math by hand on the back of the page.
[01:06:09.498 --> 01:06:10.659]  You can look it up on Google.
[01:06:10.699 --> 01:06:12.279]  It's hilarious how simple it was.
[01:06:12.399 --> 01:06:13.699]  One form, one percent of your income.
[01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:15.640]  Gotta pay a few hundred dollars.
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:24.582]  We established this Federal Reserve and the centralized banking... It doesn't seem to me a coincidence that within a few years we have a World War.
[01:06:25.202 --> 01:06:25.702]  World War I.
[01:06:26.721 --> 01:06:34.606]  And that after World War I, within a decade, we have, a little over a decade, we have the stock market collapse of 29, which of course is the Great Depression.
[01:06:35.286 --> 01:06:42.230]  And that within 10 years of the stock market crash of 29, we've got the breakout of World War II, and just a few years after that, the U.S.
[01:06:42.270 --> 01:06:42.890]  involved in that.
[01:06:43.831 --> 01:06:55.458]  And after the breakout of World War II, we have the establishment of NATO, this globalist entity, which immediately corresponds to the advent of the Cold War, which was an unnecessary escalation of conflict.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:05.042]  And because of this escalation we overspent our money so we went off the gold standard because everybody was calling us on why that was our money that we were overspending and printing money that we didn't have gold to back.
[01:07:05.382 --> 01:07:11.104]  So we go off the gold standard and then when we go off the gold standard all of a sudden we're installing the Shah in Iran in 1979.
[01:07:11.804 --> 01:07:22.667]  And then all of a sudden we're involved in all these bizarre conflicts that don't really make any sense in the Middle East because all oil needs to be sold using US dollars otherwise our currency will collapse because it's not backed by anything of value.
[01:07:24.755 --> 01:07:42.205]  So we get involved in Afghanistan, Iraq, and then these terrorist activities happen because of this, and we use those as an excuse to enact the Patriot Act, where the government can spy on our people, and then the Patriot Act is used to spy on the Trump campaign under the Obama administration, funded by the Clinton Foundation, we know, with the Russian collusion hoax.
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:08:04.185]  And so all because of this Federal Reserve, it created this domino effect that amounted to the total tyranny of our people, the total globalization of our politics, and the total complete corruption of our government by the intelligence community because it became a national security imperative that our money, which is a lie, be propped up by war after war after war.
[01:08:04.505 --> 01:08:10.471]  That's why you countlessly see examples of our politicians shilling for the Israels or the Taiwans or the Ukraines.
[01:08:10.491 --> 01:08:13.874]  It has nothing to do with protecting democracies or Judeo-Christian values.
[01:08:13.894 --> 01:08:16.016]  It has everything to do with protecting our interests.
[01:08:16.336 --> 01:08:24.283]  Our interests are all founded on the notion that the dollar must remain the global reserve currency because if it collapses, the entire world economy will collapse.
[01:08:25.304 --> 01:08:35.601]   But our enemies, who we've sanctioned and abused over decades, realize That their sovereignty, their national sovereignty, is dependent on a new global reserve currency.
[01:08:35.621 --> 01:08:51.392]  So the Iran's, the China's, the Russia's are doing everything they can to subvert the interests of the US dollar overseas to ensure they can place something else instead and determine the outcome for their own countries over the course of the 21st century in a way that was just not possible during the 20th century.
[01:08:51.713 --> 01:08:52.953]  That's what these conflicts boil down to.
[01:08:53.014 --> 01:08:54.254]  Our intelligence community knows this.
[01:08:54.515 --> 01:09:04.140]   And they're frantically trying to establish an alternative system Because they know that this current lie that is our money is inevitably going to collapse.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:16.546]  They understand that fiat currency can't live forever, that Ponzi schemes must expand indefinitely before they totally collapse, and they realize that this collapse is evident because there's not that much more expansion that can be done.
[01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:20.847]  Frankly, our previous expansion has been compromised, whether it's through BRICS or other foreign relations.
[01:09:22.208 --> 01:09:35.979]   And so what's happening right now is a war for who's in control Of all of the world's resources, trade routes, supplies, economies, who is in control when the collapse of the dollar happens?
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:44.048]  Because whoever is in control when the collapse happens is going to be the entity that is going to be capable of establishing what the response to the collapse is going to be.
[01:09:44.268 --> 01:09:47.132]  It's going to be capable of determining what's going to happen next.
[01:09:47.532 --> 01:09:49.533]  So the United States wants to determine what happens next.
[01:09:49.593 --> 01:09:51.073]  It's partnered with the global community.
[01:09:51.133 --> 01:09:59.255]  It's partnered with NATO, UN, WEF and others to try to get all Western cultures in on this new central bank digital currency so they can determine what happens next.
[01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:09.078]  And right now we see China and Russia and Iran conspiring to try to get as much power over the region as possible so they can determine their own digital currency that will be the backing of the next economy.
[01:10:10.658 --> 01:10:15.363]  And globalists understand that globalism does not work as long as any nation has sovereignty.
[01:10:15.403 --> 01:10:18.045]  National sovereignty being antithetical itself to globalism.
[01:10:18.826 --> 01:10:20.868]  And that's why they've been so antagonistic toward Russia.
[01:10:20.928 --> 01:10:27.234]  Because Russia seems to be the only country, major superpower, not playing ball.
[01:10:27.354 --> 01:10:28.515]  Aside from perhaps China.
[01:10:28.895 --> 01:10:31.638]  Not playing ball with the globalist agenda.
[01:10:31.918 --> 01:10:34.361]  71% of their economy is dependent on energy exports.
[01:10:35.461 --> 01:10:47.446]  And the globalists are constantly trying to shift our energy throughout the world to this green energy hoax, despite the fact that it would result in the death of millions of people in third world countries who depend on fossil fuels in order to survive.
[01:10:48.026 --> 01:10:52.708]  We could take a hit in America because we're a wealthy nation, but thousands would survive.
[01:10:53.028 --> 01:10:55.289]  This is the depopulation agenda of the globalist folks.
[01:10:55.309 --> 01:10:57.110]  They don't mean to kill everybody in America.
[01:10:57.150 --> 01:10:57.710]  We're the rich ones.
[01:10:57.730 --> 01:11:01.572]  They want to kill the poor people that are a burden on humanity and resources.
[01:11:02.918 --> 01:11:04.663]  And you hear bizarre stories too.
[01:11:04.703 --> 01:11:09.577]  We know this escalation is happening because you hear bizarre stories about Secretary Blinken out of nowhere.
[01:11:10.543 --> 01:11:20.269]  Despite all these other conflicts that seem much more important, whether it's Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, whatever, out of nowhere just criticizing Uganda for its policies on homosexuality?
[01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:24.331]  Why does Secretary Blinken care what Uganda does in terms of gay rights?
[01:11:25.132 --> 01:11:30.855]  It's not like there's a lot of upward pressure among Democrats in the United States to say something about Uganda's gay policy.
[01:11:30.916 --> 01:11:31.636]  Nobody here cares.
[01:11:31.676 --> 01:11:35.558]  Not even the gay community, the LGBTQ community cares about what's happening in Uganda.
[01:11:35.578 --> 01:11:37.520]  They're fighting for gay rights here in the United States.
[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:42.364]  So why is Blinken coming out and being so antagonistic to Uganda of all places?
[01:11:42.404 --> 01:11:48.149]  Well, when you look into it, it turns out Russia has recently partnered with Uganda to establish nuclear energy.
[01:11:48.189 --> 01:11:50.251]  And I guess Uganda's got a lot of uranium.
[01:11:50.511 --> 01:11:55.676]  And though they've promised not to export it anywhere, they're seemingly exporting it to Iran for enrichment.
[01:11:56.257 --> 01:12:09.151]   And Iran simultaneously seems to be enriching its own uranium because it's trying to expand if it doesn't already have Nuclear power, which it probably does, is trying to expand its nuclear capabilities because it's being funded by China to antagonize Israel.
[01:12:10.312 --> 01:12:12.352]  Why do we want to antagonize them against Israel and China?
[01:12:12.392 --> 01:12:14.053]  Why does China want to antagonize Israel?
[01:12:14.393 --> 01:12:20.015]  Well, because we are trying to build trade corridors through Israel that are going to compete with China's Belt and Road Initiative.
[01:12:20.395 --> 01:12:27.337]  China's Belt and Road Initiative, of course, is an effort for China to control trade in the region so it can supplant the dollar as a global reserve currency.
[01:12:28.834 --> 01:12:47.348]  So indirectly, all these conflicts that we're having in Israel and Russia and Taiwan, all of them boil down to control over what the global reserve currency is going to be because our enemies abroad are sick of being bullied by the United States via sanctions, sanctions that are only possible because our currency is the global reserve currency.
[01:12:48.308 --> 01:13:02.410]   And so through our abuse of this power, through our manipulation of our currency over the last 50, 60, 70 years, Through the injustices that we, the United States, have committed upon the world, we have engendered such bitterness that we are on the cusp of World War III.
[01:13:04.551 --> 01:13:09.753]  Humanity is on the verge of potential mass extinction, certainly a mass extinction event if there was nuclear war.
[01:13:10.922 --> 01:13:12.382]  And it's all because our money is a lie.
[01:13:12.402 --> 01:13:18.944]  I mean, there's a reason in the Bible God gives you like 10 things to do plus Jesus threw on the 11th commandment, love one another as I have loved you.
[01:13:19.664 --> 01:13:22.445]  There's a reason that one of the commandments is never lie.
[01:13:23.765 --> 01:13:25.046]  Say what you will about Jordan Peterson.
[01:13:25.166 --> 01:13:27.006]  I know that I don't agree with everything that he says.
[01:13:27.026 --> 01:13:30.407]  I know that there's some things about him that seem like conflicts.
[01:13:30.987 --> 01:13:31.868]  But I think he's a brilliant man.
[01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:32.588]  I think he's a good man.
[01:13:33.069 --> 01:13:39.655]  And the biggest thing he has ever emphasized, the most important thing he's ever emphasized, is how important it is never to lie.
[01:13:39.675 --> 01:13:40.296]  And everybody lies.
[01:13:40.436 --> 01:13:40.796]  I lie.
[01:13:40.856 --> 01:13:41.336]  You lie.
[01:13:41.857 --> 01:13:43.298]  Nobody lies like the political class.
[01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:45.781]  That's just a whole other level of lying that I wouldn't be capable of.
[01:13:45.861 --> 01:13:46.641]  But everybody lies.
[01:13:47.062 --> 01:13:48.683]  It's so important not to lie.
[01:13:48.783 --> 01:13:53.488]  And the reason God tells us not to lie is not because of some dogmatic notion.
[01:13:54.625 --> 01:14:00.192]  Not because he's just imposing rules on us or it's bad and we're supposed to show him our discipline because we're always tempted to lie.
[01:14:00.232 --> 01:14:01.113]  Lying seems so convenient.
[01:14:01.133 --> 01:14:14.629]  The reason he tells us not to lie is because lying is the propellant, the fuel, the energy that brings about the destruction not only of individuals but of entire peoples.
[01:14:16.701 --> 01:14:18.602]  So when you lie in your marriage, your marriage is going to fall apart.
[01:14:18.642 --> 01:14:20.383]  When you lie in your career, your career is going to fall apart.
[01:14:20.403 --> 01:14:21.943]  If you lie to people, your life is going to fall apart.
[01:14:21.963 --> 01:14:26.885]  But what if your nation built an entire currency and the entire value of that currency itself is a lie?
[01:14:28.886 --> 01:14:35.269]  And if we experience the retribution for our sins as individuals, what retribution are we going to experience as a nation for our sins as a nation?
[01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:48.578]  This lie has been so gigantic that it is literally resulting in the bombing of innocent people every single day, and has been the cause of every single injustice that's happened war-wise from the United States over the last 50, 60, or 70 years.
[01:14:49.118 --> 01:14:59.025]  Whether it was in Vietnam, or Iraq, or Afghanistan, or these conflicts that we're in today, these people are dying because our money is a lie, and we have to prop up that lie, otherwise we're worried the entire world economy is going to collapse.
[01:15:00.326 --> 01:15:03.808]  We should never have lied to begin with, but our politicians, we allowed them to lie.
[01:15:04.994 --> 01:15:08.839]  We empowered them and we looked the other way and we went off the gold standard.
[01:15:08.859 --> 01:15:09.860]  We didn't do anything about it.
[01:15:10.281 --> 01:15:21.296]  When hyperinflation happened, we complained about what was costing us here in the United States in terms of oil, but we didn't realize that systemically there's a fundamental problem that will not correct itself.
[01:15:23.351 --> 01:15:38.537]  We, the people of the United States of America, have a duty to each other, to our country, to ourselves, to find a way to get our government, our institutions, to acknowledge this lie and correct it, because if we don't, it could be the end of humanity.
[01:15:39.017 --> 01:15:49.101]  It could result in such conflict, and war, and collapse, and despair, and suffering, and famine, and starvation, the likes of which the world has never seen.
[01:15:50.103 --> 01:15:52.626]  I want to take your calls for the next hour or so.

[01:16:45.502 --> 01:16:58.502]  They shall never be forgotten.
[01:16:58.542 --> 01:17:00.062]  I am Chase Geiser, your host this evening.
[01:17:00.102 --> 01:17:01.422]  Don't worry, Alex will be back.
[01:17:01.462 --> 01:17:02.922]  He is on a much deserved vacation.
[01:17:02.942 --> 01:17:05.303]  I believe he's going to be back at the end of the week.
[01:17:06.623 --> 01:17:09.524]  So we will be playing a little bit of musical chairs with the hosts throughout the week.
[01:17:09.544 --> 01:17:11.024]  We are going to be taking calls for the next hour.
[01:17:11.044 --> 01:17:14.245]  We're calling 877-789-2539.
[01:17:14.285 --> 01:17:16.686]  The lines are lit up right now, but I will be going through these calls.
[01:17:17.886 --> 01:17:23.227]  So if you have to wait on hold, if you hear a busy hold, or if you hear a busy signal, just try again in a few minutes as we go through the calls.
[01:17:24.882 --> 01:17:26.476]  I do want to mention that...
[01:17:27.759 --> 01:17:33.821]  In an hour, for the hour and a half after that, we are going to be showing Alex Jones' interview with Diane Kayser.
[01:17:34.462 --> 01:17:42.484]  Now, Diane Kayser is a holistic health expert and she is also going to be on the show with Owen this week.
[01:17:42.504 --> 01:17:51.848]  So, Owen's going to interview holistic health expert, Diane Kayser, who's made major discoveries in nanotechnology found in cosmetics, female products, and dental products and other things.
[01:17:51.868 --> 01:17:54.149]  So, you're going to want to hear the interview that we show.
[01:17:55.049 --> 01:17:58.811]  Of hers with Alex, because they're going to be taking calls together and answering questions, as I understand.
[01:17:58.851 --> 01:18:04.553]  So she's going to be rejoining us this Wednesday, taking your calls and any health concerns and anything you hear in the interview that we run tonight.
[01:18:05.133 --> 01:18:16.798]  And after that, we're going to debut the new 30 Minutes, where Owen sits down with an illegal immigrant child escort and explains how they are potentially being trafficked all around the country.
[01:18:17.219 --> 01:18:17.759]  So stay tuned.
[01:18:17.779 --> 01:18:19.419]  But in the meantime, we are going to be taking calls.
[01:18:19.439 --> 01:18:21.480]  Let's go first to Scott in Massachusetts.
[01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:22.681]  Scott, what is on your mind, sir?
[01:18:24.471 --> 01:18:25.611]  Hey, how's it going, Chase?
[01:18:25.691 --> 01:18:26.552]  Good, thanks for your call.
[01:18:27.712 --> 01:18:32.953]  Alright, last week you seemed a little concerned about us taking too much power back.
[01:18:33.593 --> 01:18:37.714]  I'm not concerned about us taking the power back, I'm concerned about what we do with the power when we take it back.
[01:18:37.734 --> 01:18:38.814]  I think we should take it all back.
[01:18:39.755 --> 01:18:40.195]  Just to be clear.
[01:18:40.235 --> 01:18:43.936]  Right, take it all back, but I mean, it seemed like you were being overly cautious.
[01:18:44.236 --> 01:18:44.816]  Yes, maybe.
[01:18:44.876 --> 01:18:47.776]  And I think that trials are going to be needed.
[01:18:48.037 --> 01:18:48.417]  Of course.
[01:18:48.517 --> 01:18:53.178]  For pretty much everyone in Washington, D.C., including all J6 jurors.
[01:18:53.818 --> 01:18:54.018]  Yes.
[01:18:55.531 --> 01:18:57.532]  Especially for the praying grandmother.
[01:18:57.552 --> 01:19:07.078]  I mean, yes, yeah, they held out for what 36 hours, but still If that's just one person of a jury of 12.
[01:19:07.338 --> 01:19:10.620]  Yes, that person was finally beaten down.
[01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:17.083]  That's still that one more person is weak and They don't deserve.
[01:19:17.704 --> 01:19:24.170]   Well, they deserve a free fair trial and But then they deserve punishment after that for doing that to that lady.
[01:19:24.511 --> 01:19:24.992]  Absolutely.
[01:19:25.012 --> 01:19:26.113]  That's just absolutely horrible.
[01:19:26.313 --> 01:19:26.954]  It's horrible.
[01:19:27.334 --> 01:19:31.460]  It broke my heart to see and obviously we've been covering the J6 stuff for a long time.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.342]  A lot of people went to prison erroneously.
[01:19:33.362 --> 01:19:38.609]  Holland Schreuer is a close friend of mine and he's somebody that went to prison for no good reason because of this protest.
[01:19:38.649 --> 01:19:39.270]  It was sick.
[01:19:39.810 --> 01:19:40.110]  To see.
[01:19:40.570 --> 01:19:43.591]  And the more crimes that they commit against us, the more embittered we become.
[01:19:44.071 --> 01:19:48.113]  I just hope that we don't go beyond the scope of justice when we take all the power back.
[01:19:48.193 --> 01:19:53.434]  And I'm talking about what happened in Germany after World War I with the Treaty of Versailles.
[01:19:53.454 --> 01:20:01.097]  That was a great injustice, but they compensated for the injustice that was done to the German people after World War I, before the Third Reich came into power.
[01:20:01.417 --> 01:20:07.239]  And they almost destroyed their entire civilization by getting involved in this World War II.
[01:20:09.827 --> 01:20:16.228]  Yeah, well, also I wanted to mention that it's a nice black-on-black shoot you got there, but lighten up a little bit, man.
[01:20:16.268 --> 01:20:17.068]  It looks kind of evil.
[01:20:17.808 --> 01:20:18.789]  Alright, well I appreciate that.
[01:20:18.829 --> 01:20:19.769]  Thanks for your feedback, Scott.
[01:20:19.969 --> 01:20:20.489]  Next, Mark.
[01:20:20.909 --> 01:20:21.629]  Mark, what's on your mind?
[01:20:21.649 --> 01:20:23.649]  Hello?
[01:20:24.189 --> 01:20:24.990]  Hey Mark, I can hear you.
[01:20:25.810 --> 01:20:38.592]  Hey, I just wanted to see what you thought about Bitcoin and the fact that what I believe is that Bitcoin is a beta test for the central bank digital currencies.
[01:20:42.928 --> 01:20:44.591]  Yes, so I totally agree with that.
[01:20:44.631 --> 01:20:58.174]   I think it's very mysterious that Bitcoin came out of nowhere and it was A white paper by an anonymous account, an anonymous account that never used any of the money, never sold any of the Bitcoin that it itself had.
[01:20:59.055 --> 01:21:10.843]  And this technology was so advanced and sophisticated that it came out of nowhere, that it's unlikely that it wasn't either a group of people or backed by somebody that was high up in this space of creating these systems.
[01:21:11.103 --> 01:21:12.544]  That's the first thing that's mysterious about it.
[01:21:12.964 --> 01:21:19.788]  Second thing is, it seemingly garnered so much attention and it had...
[01:21:21.349 --> 01:21:26.912]  It got so adopted over the course of 10-15 years that it was able to be a beta test.
[01:21:27.593 --> 01:21:32.475]  The beauty of this technology is that it can be used to keep transactions anonymous.
[01:21:32.875 --> 01:21:38.378]  It can be used to stifle inflation by the limited number of coins that are ever going to be created.
[01:21:38.798 --> 01:21:43.880]  It has all of the virtues and benefits of a libertarian currency.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:45.880]  That's what's so enticing about it.
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:57.204]  Problem is with blockchain technology, you can invert it and use it for other purposes as well, where you can create these tokens or these dollars that can only be spent on certain transactions.
[01:21:57.224 --> 01:22:12.663]   So if we revert or pivot to a central bank digital currency that's controlled by the IMF or the central bank, then they can associate some of the dollars you have for certain uses.
[01:22:12.663 --> 01:22:17.422]   So you could have $100,000 in the bank, but only be allowed to spend 1,000 of them on food,
[01:22:17.422 --> 01:22:22.623]   or 1,000 of them on fossil fuels, or 1,000 of them on health care.
[01:22:22.623 --> 01:22:26.423]   And maybe 1,000 of them have to be spent on certain products or certain services.
[01:22:26.423 --> 01:22:29.342]  This is how the New World Order can control.
[01:22:29.342 --> 01:22:30.182]  It's the mark of the beast.
[01:22:30.182 --> 01:22:35.342]   It's how they could control, practically speaking, this is the technology that can be used
[01:22:35.342 --> 01:22:37.983]  to control all people and subjugate all humanity.
[01:22:37.998 --> 01:22:39.239]  So I'm very concerned about it.
[01:22:39.259 --> 01:22:44.761]  I don't think that everybody that has Bitcoin is bad or anything like that, or that it's wrong to have Bitcoin.
[01:22:45.021 --> 01:22:52.584]  But I do think that it's likely that this Bitcoin phenomenon that we've experienced was a test for this technology before rolling it out.
[01:22:52.604 --> 01:22:57.666]  Because they want to replace the dollar after it collapses with something that they can totally control.
[01:22:57.686 --> 01:22:58.446]  What do you think, Mark?
[01:22:59.249 --> 01:23:01.630]  Yep, that is exactly what I think.
[01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:07.994]  I think it is the cashless money system that the Bible talks about is coming, and it's coming quickly.
[01:23:09.155 --> 01:23:23.883]  I think that Bitcoin would not be worth $70,000 if it weren't for the fact that a handful of people, they say that 1% of the population, or less than 1%, has 90% of the wealth.
[01:23:24.623 --> 01:23:38.646]   And I think that Bitcoin definitely would not be worth $70,000 a coin, if it weren't for the fact that one-tenth, one percent, or one percent of people are really pulling the strings on it.
[01:23:39.046 --> 01:23:48.511]  But I also think that they can't come out with a central bank digital currency, a worldwide central bank digital currency, without testing it just a little bit.
[01:23:48.911 --> 01:23:53.873]  And I honestly believe that that's what's behind Bitcoin.
[01:23:53.913 --> 01:23:58.685]   I think we all need to fight it tooth and nail so that You know, we don't.
[01:23:59.045 --> 01:24:01.206]  Because this is what I say.
[01:24:01.226 --> 01:24:02.608]  I say money is power.
[01:24:02.868 --> 01:24:04.329]  Nothing more, nothing less.
[01:24:04.949 --> 01:24:07.892]  With it, you tell that guy to dance and he'll dance for you.
[01:24:08.412 --> 01:24:12.175]  Without it, you're powerless to buy a hamburger to feed yourself.
[01:24:12.195 --> 01:24:19.460]  And when the rulers of this world control all of your money, they control everybody and everything.
[01:24:20.341 --> 01:24:20.861]  Absolutely, Mark.
[01:24:20.881 --> 01:24:21.502]  Great insights there.
[01:24:21.522 --> 01:24:23.163]  We've got time for one more call before we go to break.
[01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:24.464]  Let's hear from Jack in Wisconsin.
[01:24:24.784 --> 01:24:25.485]  Jack, what's on your mind?
[01:24:27.034 --> 01:24:30.977]  Hey Chase, I want to bring up some Christian stuff regarding the Eclipse.
[01:24:31.978 --> 01:24:35.281]  Not a lot of people talk how it's relevant to us Christians.
[01:24:35.681 --> 01:24:52.619]   I think everyone who is Christian should take a moment during the Eclipse, especially since it's so close to Easter this year, this time around too, that Matthew, Mark, and Luke I don't know what to make of it, man.
[01:24:52.439 --> 01:25:00.679]   during the crucifixion that there was a solar eclipse because God was big mad at the Jews
[01:25:00.679 --> 01:25:02.759]  and that there was also earthquakes.
[01:25:02.759 --> 01:25:03.759]  So I thought it was interesting.
[01:25:03.759 --> 01:25:08.159]  We're seeing earthquakes and an eclipse happen right now?
[01:25:08.159 --> 01:25:09.158]  Yeah.
[01:25:09.158 --> 01:25:10.679]  Yeah, that is interesting.
[01:25:10.679 --> 01:25:13.118]  And I don't know what to make of it, man.
[01:25:13.118 --> 01:25:18.958]   I'm so wary to get into interpreting passages of the Bible or symbolism in the Bible that
[01:25:18.958 --> 01:25:19.958]  I don't fully understand.
[01:25:19.958 --> 01:25:22.918]  I don't make investments in things that I don't understand.
[01:25:22.918 --> 01:25:25.838]  And that's why I'm so generally wary of this.
[01:25:25.838 --> 01:25:28.838]   But one thing I do know for sure is I understand when Jesus said that the end would come like
[01:25:28.838 --> 01:25:31.118]  a thief in the night, and nobody's going to expect it.
[01:25:31.118 --> 01:25:34.679]   So do you think that it's just kind of vain and moot to try to figure out when the end
[01:25:34.679 --> 01:25:38.439]   is going to come, given that Jesus Christ himself said no one's going to know?
[01:25:38.439 --> 01:25:46.359]   Oh, well, I'm not talking about the eclipse being a sign of Jesus's return, which it is.
[01:25:46.405 --> 01:25:46.686]  Okay.
[01:25:46.726 --> 01:25:51.726]   When he was crucified, it said in the gospel that there was three hours of darkness.
[01:25:51.726 --> 01:25:57.726]   Which scientists said was impossible, and there was a solar eclipse in the middle of the day around noon.
[01:25:58.649 --> 01:25:59.670]  Thank you so much for your call, Jack.
[01:25:59.690 --> 01:26:00.170]  I appreciate that.
[01:26:00.190 --> 01:26:01.151]  We're cutting a break right now.
[01:26:01.371 --> 01:26:02.972]  We'll be back with your calls on the other side.
[01:26:03.012 --> 01:26:05.874]  Make sure you call on 877-789-2539.
[01:26:06.174 --> 01:26:09.796]  And don't forget to visit InfoWarsStore.com to be the reason that we are still on the air.

[01:26:30.189 --> 01:26:32.290]  We're going to be taking calls for the next 45 minutes or so.
[01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:33.910]  877-789-2539.

[01:27:26.607 --> 01:27:35.854]  At this very crucial time, not just for the United States of America as we come up on this election on November 5th, but for humanity as a whole, because globalism is not something that's just going to harm the people of America.
[01:27:36.174 --> 01:27:56.398]   It is something that is going to harm the people of the world, as its very manifestation is the subjugation of all people by a political class which seeks to not only keep its power indefinitely, but expand it to the limit without any recourse or threat of losing it from People.
[01:27:56.658 --> 01:27:57.638]  No accountability to the people.

[01:28:21.204 --> 01:28:23.005]  Let's go straight to Bart in Georgia.
[01:28:23.445 --> 01:28:24.285]  Bart, what is on your mind?
[01:28:25.618 --> 01:28:26.098]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:26.138 --> 01:28:28.900]  I want to talk about Biden's border bloodbath.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:33.082]  The first two things that come to mind are the drug cartels and prostitution.
[01:28:33.342 --> 01:28:39.225]  And usually these, when you call the police, usually when they show, they only show up and there's drug money and prostitution money.
[01:28:39.725 --> 01:28:43.447]  But I also want to talk about, um, Bill Gates has new neighbors.
[01:28:44.127 --> 01:28:50.990]  Um, the drug cartel, uh, kingpins are moving into Seattle and these are people that are very dangerous.
[01:28:51.931 --> 01:28:52.471]  Absolutely.
[01:28:52.511 --> 01:28:54.192]  And actually there was this clip that I wanted to go over.
[01:28:55.086 --> 01:28:56.167]  This is clip number seven.
[01:28:56.187 --> 01:28:59.470]  New York City homeowners explain how squatter crisis has gotten out of control.
[01:28:59.490 --> 01:29:08.818]  When I was at Eagle Pass, we're on the clip in a second, when I was at Eagle Pass covering the border, all the locals told us was that the whole town was basically under control.
[01:29:10.235 --> 01:29:13.675]  of the cartels and the poverty rate is very high.
[01:29:13.675 --> 01:29:16.555]   The average income is very low in Eagle Pass and other border towns.
[01:29:16.555 --> 01:29:21.435]   And they were paying off, the cartels were paying off ranchers that lived along the Rio Grande
[01:29:21.435 --> 01:29:27.675]   so that they could build driveways and expedite the migration, the trafficking of people across
[01:29:27.675 --> 01:29:34.235]   the border. And so it's imperative to their business that these, our border is not protected,
[01:29:34.235 --> 01:29:40.074]   or if it is protected, that as many Border Patrol officers on both sides of the Rio Grande are paid
[01:29:40.074 --> 01:29:43.515]  often part of the scheme.
[01:29:41.361 --> 01:29:42.702]  They buy everyone off.
[01:29:43.122 --> 01:29:45.623]  That is how an invasion begins.
[01:29:46.123 --> 01:29:47.904]  That is how corruption or a mafia begins.
[01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:49.044]  They just pay everybody off.
[01:29:49.064 --> 01:29:51.945]  It's not that there weren't enough cops in the city, but the mob paid them off.
[01:29:52.625 --> 01:30:01.809]  That's what they're doing, and they have all the money to do it, and we've made it possible for them to do this because we have failed to fight the forces of evil and really crack down on the problem.
[01:30:02.625 --> 01:30:06.388]  We're so focused on every conflict in every country that we don't take care of our own.
[01:30:06.408 --> 01:30:09.610]  Let's go ahead and run clip number seven and stay on the line, Barb, because I want to hear what you think of this clip.
[01:30:11.151 --> 01:30:21.919]  A growing problem in the city and a nightmare for landlords, squatters who take advantage of laws that allow them to live rent-free as the lengthy court process plays out.
[01:30:22.399 --> 01:30:27.743]  CBS2 political reporter Marcia Kramer here in studio with an issue in desperate need of a solution, Marcia.
[01:30:28.243 --> 01:30:29.083]  Well, Christine, you're right.
[01:30:29.103 --> 01:30:34.125]  You know, I recently had a conversation with a friend whose mother died leaving her a house in Queens.
[01:30:34.525 --> 01:30:39.427]  Now, it should have been an easy sell, the house and the bank and the bank inheritance, but it wasn't.
[01:30:39.827 --> 01:30:45.268]  She was terrified squatters would see an empty house, move in, and she wouldn't be able to get them out.
[01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:46.769]  And she's not alone.
[01:30:47.229 --> 01:30:52.551]  Squatters have victimized many, many New Yorkers who say something just has to be done.
[01:30:53.511 --> 01:30:55.433]  My tenants only pay me one month's rent.
[01:30:55.473 --> 01:30:56.214]  They know the game.
[01:30:56.234 --> 01:30:59.057]  They know after 30 days, you cannot evict them.
[01:30:59.217 --> 01:31:01.940]  No court case should go seven years.
[01:31:02.341 --> 01:31:03.502]  Why can't you just change the locks?
[01:31:04.303 --> 01:31:06.405]  Oh, I will be arrested instantly.
[01:31:06.665 --> 01:31:07.906]  They turned off the hot water.
[01:31:08.487 --> 01:31:10.410]  And then reported that they had no hot water.
[01:31:10.450 --> 01:31:16.699]  It's a $250 fine per day, up to $15,000, punishable by five years in jail.
[01:31:16.959 --> 01:31:17.720]  So here you are.
[01:31:18.041 --> 01:31:19.463]  You have to pay the upkeep of the house.
[01:31:19.843 --> 01:31:20.083]  Right.
[01:31:20.464 --> 01:31:21.586]  And you're not getting any rent?
[01:31:21.946 --> 01:31:24.650]  I'm not getting any rent, and I'm paying the gas and electric every month.
[01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:30.655]  Four stories repeated over and over and over again by irate and often unwitting property owners.
[01:31:30.895 --> 01:31:36.919]  Worry lines marking their faces who came to City Councilwoman Vicki Palladino's office desperately seeking help.
[01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:43.365]  Hong Chen has spent thousands trying unsuccessfully to get the squatters out of this home in Mass Path.
[01:31:43.785 --> 01:31:50.090]  John Sokran, using his pension money for expenses on this college point home, he hoped to provide retirement income.
[01:31:50.570 --> 01:31:58.434]  And Susan Mascara, who's used up her savings paying for seven years of upkeep on this Bayside home she inherited from her mother.
[01:31:58.454 --> 01:31:59.354]  I'm in debt.
[01:31:59.774 --> 01:32:01.975]  My credit cards are pretty much maxed out.
[01:32:02.175 --> 01:32:03.376]  Some of them make me cry.
[01:32:03.876 --> 01:32:06.357]  All I want to do is make things better.
[01:32:06.637 --> 01:32:15.201]  Councilwoman Vicki Palladino says part of the solution is to change the law which allows people to claim squatters' rights after living in a place for 30 days.
[01:32:15.642 --> 01:32:17.102]  She wants it changed to 180 days.
[01:32:18.843 --> 01:32:21.184]  They own the property and they have no rights.
[01:32:21.684 --> 01:32:22.704]  Squatter rights?
[01:32:23.024 --> 01:32:23.864]  Oxymoron.
[01:32:24.264 --> 01:32:26.305]  Squatters have no rights.
[01:32:26.465 --> 01:32:31.906]  Squatters terrified this woman who lived next door to this Whitestone home, a home they took possession of.
[01:32:31.926 --> 01:32:36.487]  7.30 in the morning, there'd be people on the front lawn, drinking beer, smoking pot.
[01:32:36.608 --> 01:32:41.369]  Different cars from different states showing up, and then license plates being swapped.
[01:32:41.589 --> 01:32:43.649]  It was frightening.
[01:32:46.737 --> 01:32:49.457]  are supposed to protect us against no quarter.
[01:32:49.457 --> 01:32:53.056]   But it seems like these squatter laws are a violation themselves of
[01:32:53.056 --> 01:32:57.777]   our right to our own property. Bart, what do you think of that? I know that specific example wasn't
[01:32:57.777 --> 01:33:02.176]   directly related to illegal migrants, but obviously these two problems are heavily intertwined because
[01:33:02.176 --> 01:33:06.817]   there are illegal migrants that are moving in and driving the costs of housing up. And the squatter
[01:33:06.817 --> 01:33:09.046]  laws are just exacerbating the problem amidst this invasion.
[01:33:09.046 --> 01:33:10.416]  What do you think about that, Bart?
[01:33:11.456 --> 01:33:15.747]  Well, the police, the law is going to do nothing about it.
[01:33:15.747 --> 01:33:17.935]  I say vigilantism is the answer.
[01:33:18.157 --> 01:33:27.861]  And there was a case, I don't know, about two or three weeks ago where they were squatting in the house and then four dudes broke in the middle of the night and they smashed this dude's kneecap in with a crowbar.
[01:33:27.881 --> 01:33:29.542]  Said, you're going to be out tomorrow.
[01:33:29.582 --> 01:33:30.222]  We're coming back.
[01:33:30.322 --> 01:33:32.503]  That's how the mafia started to begin with, right?
[01:33:32.603 --> 01:33:35.524]  Everybody was being oppressive towards the Italian immigrants.
[01:33:36.065 --> 01:33:48.917]   And so in the Italian neighborhoods in Chicago or New York, The mob had to come about to offer protection, and of course it expanded and became its own organized crime, but it was because justice wasn't being provided.
[01:33:48.937 --> 01:33:53.443]  And when justice isn't provided to a people, they find a way to get justice on their own, don't they?
[01:33:55.109 --> 01:33:55.349]  Yes.
[01:33:55.389 --> 01:34:03.714]  So the last thing I have to say, if you want to watch Alex Jones and then this podcast later on, go to Bart Fine on Rumble and Bitchute and watch the replay later on tonight.
[01:34:04.075 --> 01:34:04.355]  Awesome.
[01:34:04.375 --> 01:34:07.517]  Send me a link on on X and I'll try to repost it if I remember.
[01:34:07.537 --> 01:34:07.997]  Thanks, Bart.
[01:34:08.037 --> 01:34:08.898]  Lynn in Columbus.
[01:34:08.938 --> 01:34:09.798]  Lynn, what is on your mind?
[01:34:11.099 --> 01:34:13.200]  I'm thinking OK Corral.
[01:34:13.681 --> 01:34:20.445]  If Trump wants that White House, we need a rally in Washington, D.C.
[01:34:20.625 --> 01:34:27.885]   and maybe Marjorie Taylor Greene Can bring forth the evictions of everybody up there.
[01:34:29.526 --> 01:34:37.549]  And I know a way that we can get 100% turnout.
[01:34:38.829 --> 01:34:54.759]   If Trump is at that rally and the Holy Spirit convicts him, he falls on his knees and he's asking God to bless him in this country. He jumps up, he leaps in
[01:34:54.759 --> 01:35:01.399]   there, comes down speaking a language I don't know and then everybody in the audience gets it. I
[01:35:01.399 --> 01:35:04.720]  think the power will be there.
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:14.319]   I've been feeling a shift in the zeitgeist online. It's obvious to me that people really are waking
[01:35:15.088 --> 01:35:23.270]  You can just see the way that the content is shifting on social media and the way people are responding to it and what's going viral.
[01:35:23.590 --> 01:35:39.594]   It's not just a matter of algorithm changes since Elon Musk has taken over, but I'm really feeling on a societal level as a civilization here in the United States of America that the American people are waking up to I think this book you're writing, okay, is gonna be a bestseller.
[01:35:39.614 --> 01:35:40.615]  And I want an autographed copy.
[01:35:40.635 --> 01:35:40.755]  Okay.
[01:35:40.574 --> 01:35:41.574]  Am I just in a bubble?
[01:35:41.574 --> 01:35:48.135]   I think, I think this book you're writing, okay, is going to be a bestseller.
[01:35:48.135 --> 01:35:49.135]  I hope you're right.
[01:35:49.135 --> 01:35:51.574]  And I want an autographed copy.
[01:35:51.574 --> 01:35:53.574]  I'll hook you up, Len.
[01:35:53.574 --> 01:35:54.574]  Okay.
[01:35:54.574 --> 01:35:55.574]  I appreciate that.
[01:35:55.574 --> 01:35:56.574]  God bless you.
[01:35:56.574 --> 01:35:57.574]  Let's hear from Tin Man in Texas.
[01:35:57.574 --> 01:35:58.574]  Tin Man, what's up?
[01:35:58.574 --> 01:36:00.894]  Hey Chase, how you doing?
[01:36:01.132 --> 01:36:01.712]  Hey, we're doing well.
[01:36:01.732 --> 01:36:05.635]  I just want to warn you that I did take this call before I looked at the clock, so we've only got about a minute left.
[01:36:05.715 --> 01:36:09.978]  Stay with us after the break and I'll make sure you can finish your thought, but go ahead.
[01:36:11.239 --> 01:36:11.459]  Okay.
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:17.003]  Well, I have a thought right now, really, is on the central bank digital currency.
[01:36:18.536 --> 01:36:23.857]  Well, like the dollar is the first time the world ever got on a fiat currency.
[01:36:24.077 --> 01:36:24.557]  Yeah.
[01:36:24.657 --> 01:36:29.658]  So I think I think this is it's also has something to do with the turning of turning of times.
[01:36:29.938 --> 01:36:30.558]  Yes.
[01:36:30.658 --> 01:36:37.939]  But but this being the first time that the whole world's been on on the fiat currency and, you know, the dollar is the the world, you know, currency.
[01:36:38.759 --> 01:36:47.721]  It might it might just be this time that, you know, instead of a world war where we're all fighting each other, maybe it will be a world war where we're just fighting the bank.
[01:36:48.081 --> 01:36:49.122]  Wow, stick with us, Tim.
[01:36:49.142 --> 01:36:50.162]  We're cutting a break right now.
[01:36:50.422 --> 01:36:51.423]  That's a very good point.
[01:36:51.443 --> 01:36:53.524]  I want to go back and forth with you a little bit on the other side.
[01:36:57.766 --> 01:37:04.148]  You shouldn't purchase the products at InfoWarsStore.com just because it keeps us on the air.
[01:37:05.009 --> 01:37:08.390]  You should get these products because they are game-changing.
[01:37:08.571 --> 01:37:13.293]  Everybody knows our information is some of the most hardcore, accurate intel on the planet.
[01:37:14.172 --> 01:37:16.835]  Well, our products are absolutely no different.
[01:37:17.335 --> 01:37:18.636]  They are amazing.
[01:37:18.676 --> 01:37:20.578]  They are the missing links people need.
[01:37:21.079 --> 01:37:28.145]  And of all the deficiencies that are out there, one of the biggest problems on the planet is iodine deficiency.
[01:37:28.185 --> 01:37:30.708]  Just look up iodine deficiency on Wikipedia.
[01:37:31.573 --> 01:37:38.958]  More than 2 billion people, the UN estimates, have major cognitive disabilities because they haven't had iodine.
[01:37:39.518 --> 01:37:48.564]  It is essential in all electrochemical activity of the body, but most iodine in plants or in meat is bound to other compounds or other elements.
[01:37:49.184 --> 01:37:50.866]  So you don't get the full absorption.
[01:37:51.366 --> 01:37:52.227]  Not with X3.
[01:37:52.307 --> 01:37:56.911]  It has all three of the healthy types of iodine in it.
[01:37:57.271 --> 01:38:05.158]  The good halogens, the deep earth crystal, pure nascent iodine, and then two other types the scientists tell us help with absorption.
[01:38:06.119 --> 01:38:08.542]  X3 has been sold out for six months.
[01:38:09.082 --> 01:38:18.251]  It's now back in stock for 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com and it funds the broadcast and everything else we do.
[01:38:18.632 --> 01:38:24.818]  So I want to encourage you all to get your X3 for 40% off now at InfoWarsStore.com.
