[00:00:15.604 --> 00:00:30.563]  InfoWars.
[00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.190]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:45.009]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:51.009]  Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Whoa!
[00:00:51.009 --> 00:01:01.009]  USA! USA! USA!
[00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:03.009]  Well, I want to thank everybody.
[00:01:03.461 --> 00:01:05.542]  This is a fantastic state.
[00:01:06.662 --> 00:01:08.383]  This is a great, great state.
[00:01:09.344 --> 00:01:12.205]  You know, we won New Hampshire three times now.
[00:01:12.285 --> 00:01:12.605]  Three.
[00:01:15.447 --> 00:01:16.487]  We win it every time.
[00:01:16.527 --> 00:01:17.508]  We win the primary.
[00:01:17.548 --> 00:01:19.389]  We win the generals.
[00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:22.610]  We've won it and it's a very, very special place to me.
[00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.431]  It's very important.
[00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:27.633]  If you remember in 2016, we came here and we needed that winner.
[00:01:27.673 --> 00:01:29.734]  We won by 21 points and it was great.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.827]  And today, I have to tell you, it was very interesting because I said, wow, what a great victory.
[00:01:37.287 --> 00:01:43.314]  But then somebody ran up to the stage, all dressed up nicely, when it was at 7.
[00:01:43.374 --> 00:01:44.896]  But now I just walked up and it's at 14.
[00:01:44.936 --> 00:01:49.622]  But she ran up when it was 7.
[00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:54.240]  And, you know, we have to do what's good for our party.
[00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:59.584]  And she was up and I said, wow, she's doing like a speech like she won.
[00:02:00.285 --> 00:02:00.966]  She didn't win.
[00:02:01.026 --> 00:02:01.606]  She lost.
[00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:07.431]  And, you know, last last week we had a little bit of a problem.
[00:02:07.511 --> 00:02:13.576]  And if you remember, Ron was very upset because she ran up and she pretended she won Iowa.
[00:02:15.188 --> 00:02:17.390]  And I looked around, I said, didn't she come in third?
[00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.591]  Yeah, she came in third.
[00:02:19.712 --> 00:02:24.257]  And then I looked at the polls, she was talking about most winnability, who's going to win.
[00:02:24.317 --> 00:02:27.239]  And I had one put up, I don't know if you see it, but I have one put up.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.106]  We've won almost every single poll in the last three months against crooked Joe Biden, almost every poll.
[00:02:34.506 --> 00:02:36.108]  And she doesn't win those polls.
[00:02:38.504 --> 00:02:39.625]  And she doesn't win this.
[00:02:39.685 --> 00:02:46.650]  This is not your typical victory speech, but let's not have somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night.
[00:02:47.411 --> 00:02:48.632]  She had a very bad night.
[00:02:49.953 --> 00:02:56.758]  And you have the now very unpopular governor of this state.
[00:02:56.798 --> 00:02:58.379]  This guy, he's got to be on something.
[00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:00.141]  I've never seen anybody with energy.
[00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:03.597]  He's like a hopscotch.
[00:03:04.638 --> 00:03:09.383]  And you know, I'm watching this guy and two weeks ago said, we're going to win.
[00:03:09.403 --> 00:03:10.224]  We're going to win in Atlanta.
[00:03:10.244 --> 00:03:11.625]  We're going to win about three days ago.
[00:03:11.685 --> 00:03:14.108]  So I said, well, we want to do well.
[00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:15.950]  That's a big difference.
[00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:18.012]  But I walked out just now.
[00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:20.535]  We're 14 points up and I don't know what it's going to be.
[00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:22.857]  But when she was up here, it was like six or seven.
[00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:27.011]  And you know, with like 7% of the vote counted.
[00:03:27.752 --> 00:03:33.955]  Now, let me just tell you, we had an unbelievable week last week in Iowa.
[00:03:34.456 --> 00:03:35.456]  We set a record.
[00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:44.450]   It was the best in the history of the caucus, in the history And I remember I sort of had the same feeling.
[00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.055]  I'm up and I'm watching, and I said, she's taking a victory lap.
[00:03:49.155 --> 00:03:53.439]  And we beat her so badly, she was... But Ron beat her also.
[00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.762]  You know, Ron came in second and he left.
[00:03:56.422 --> 00:03:58.745]  She came in third and she's still hanging around.
[00:04:00.326 --> 00:04:04.208]  The other thing, she only got 25% of the Republican votes.
[00:04:04.248 --> 00:04:05.209]  I don't know if you saw that.
[00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:19.720]   Tremendous numbers of independents came out, because in this state, because you have a governor that doesn't frankly know what the hell he's doing, in this state, in the Republican primary, They accept Democrats to vote.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.362]  In fact, I think they had 4,000 Democrats before October 6th.
[00:04:24.923 --> 00:04:25.763]  They already voted.
[00:04:26.743 --> 00:04:30.385]  Now, they're only voting because they want to make me look as bad as possible.
[00:04:30.925 --> 00:04:33.006]  Because if you remember, we won in 2016.
[00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:38.269]  And if you really remember, if you want to play it straight, we also won in 2020.
[00:04:38.109 --> 00:04:49.349]   in 2020 by more. And we did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016.
[00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:50.349]  [applause]
[00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:53.886]  But as they said, we lost by a whisker, just by a whisker.
[00:04:54.867 --> 00:04:55.668]  No, no, no.
[00:04:55.748 --> 00:04:57.030]  But we can't let that happen.
[00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.953]  You know, you have to have people that speak up.
[00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:03.437]   I said, I can go up and I can say to everybody, oh, thank you for the victory.
[00:05:03.497 --> 00:05:04.177]  It's wonderful.
[00:05:04.217 --> 00:05:12.524]  It's what or I can go up and say, who the hell was the imposter that went up on the stage before and like claimed a victory?
[00:05:12.584 --> 00:05:13.965]  She did very poorly, actually.
[00:05:14.265 --> 00:05:15.065]  She had to win.
[00:05:15.686 --> 00:05:17.287]  The governor said she's going to win.
[00:05:17.327 --> 00:05:17.868]  She's going to win.
[00:05:17.888 --> 00:05:18.528]  She's going to win.
[00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:21.310]  Then she she failed badly.
[00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.273]  Now I have here if he promises to do it in a minute or less.
[00:05:26.454 --> 00:05:31.656]  But the only person more angry than, let's say me, but I don't get too angry, I get even.
[00:05:32.396 --> 00:05:42.060]  The only person... Because he was there, and he did fantastically well, by the way, and then he endorsed me.
[00:05:42.921 --> 00:05:47.522]  And we don't have to talk about Tim Scott, who, by the way, just got engaged, we have to tell you.
[00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:53.665]  And that's more important than all of this stuff.
[00:05:55.342 --> 00:05:59.084]  But a man that got to know her very well is Vivek.
[00:05:59.624 --> 00:06:00.484]  I said Vivek.
[00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:03.326]  I said Vivek.
[00:06:04.446 --> 00:06:06.667]  Go up and say a few words about it.
[00:06:07.028 --> 00:06:08.828]  He has to do it in one minute or less.
[00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:12.590]  And then we're going to just say, we had one hell of a night tonight.
[00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.611]  One other thing before Vivek comes.
[00:06:15.772 --> 00:06:16.612]  Do you see that, Paul?
[00:06:16.632 --> 00:06:17.453]  We're going to put it up.
[00:06:18.353 --> 00:06:20.234]  We have beaten Biden.
[00:06:21.054 --> 00:06:23.035]  You could almost say, who can't?
[00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:24.296]  Who the hell can't?
[00:06:26.175 --> 00:06:28.556]  The man can't put two sentences together.
[00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:31.956]  He can't find the stairs off a stage.
[00:06:32.457 --> 00:06:32.917]  Who can't?
[00:06:33.537 --> 00:06:36.217]  But, Vivek, one minute or less.
[00:06:36.338 --> 00:06:37.278]  Go do it, Vivek.
[00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:48.340]  What we saw tonight is America first defeating America last.
[00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:50.061]  That's what we saw tonight.
[00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:54.230]  If you want America last, you can go to Joe Biden.
[00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.830]  You got another candidate still apparently in the Republican primary.
[00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.791]  Cut your Social Security to fork over more money to Ukraine so some kleptocrat can buy a bigger house.
[00:07:02.231 --> 00:07:03.252]  Go to Nikki Haley.
[00:07:03.792 --> 00:07:07.272]  But you know who delivered a double-digit victory tonight?
[00:07:07.312 --> 00:07:10.213]  It is a double-digit victory as of right now.
[00:07:10.713 --> 00:07:15.634]  It's this man, Donald J. Trump, the leader of America first.
[00:07:16.214 --> 00:07:17.275]  And that means something.
[00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.728]  USA and Donald Trump, America first.
[00:07:22.768 --> 00:07:24.268]  Now I got, I got 30 seconds left.
[00:07:24.288 --> 00:07:25.668]  I want to make this point here, okay?
[00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:27.989]  We got to say this, we got to say this right.
[00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:33.650]  What we see right now with her continuing in this race is the ugly underbelly of American politics.
[00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.951]  Where the mega donors are trying to do one thing when we the people say another.
[00:07:38.412 --> 00:07:41.892]  And it's up to us, to we the people, to at long last say hell no.
[00:07:42.313 --> 00:07:45.133]  We the people create a government that is accountable to us.
[00:07:45.553 --> 00:07:47.914]  And we the people have said tonight, we want again.
[00:07:48.434 --> 00:07:50.855]  As we did in Iowa, Donald J. Trump.
[00:07:50.935 --> 00:07:54.717]  And so you want to actually speak truth, that's the truth tonight.
[00:07:55.238 --> 00:08:00.060]  And the only thing they're rooting for is an ugly thing that we don't want to see happen.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:12.668]   That's what these people are rooting for, is playing to say long enough so the Reid Hoffmans and the ugly Democratic George Soros Juniors, who are funding the lawsuits against Trump, can prop up their puppet, We say no to that vision.
[00:08:13.088 --> 00:08:18.655]  I say the general election begins tonight, and this man will win it in a landslide.
[00:08:19.135 --> 00:08:21.378]  God bless you, Donald J. Trump.
[00:08:21.578 --> 00:08:23.578]  Vote Trump USA!
[00:08:23.578 --> 00:08:29.937]  [Applause]
[00:08:29.937 --> 00:08:30.937]  Very nice.
[00:08:31.069 --> 00:08:31.790]  Wasn't that nice?
[00:08:34.128 --> 00:08:41.375]  So this was a great evening and I want to thank everybody in the audience and I want to thank the people that are standing behind me.
[00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:45.378]  You know, I think we called it right.
[00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:46.680]  Immigration is a big deal.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.460]  A big deal.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.681]  A very big deal.
[00:08:48.701 --> 00:08:52.245]  We have millions and millions of people flowing into our country illegally.
[00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:54.887]  We have no idea who the hell they are.
[00:08:55.768 --> 00:09:00.272]  They come from prisons and they come from mental institutions.
[00:09:01.392 --> 00:09:04.133]  And it's just killing our country.
[00:09:04.233 --> 00:09:06.813]  And I'm talking about millions and millions and millions.
[00:09:07.774 --> 00:09:09.454]  They are drug dealers.
[00:09:09.614 --> 00:09:10.534]  They're everybody.
[00:09:11.355 --> 00:09:14.515]  And they come in just like walking right through.
[00:09:14.535 --> 00:09:17.736]  There's nobody to check and there's nobody to vet.
[00:09:18.456 --> 00:09:24.038]  And we have a man with us tonight, Tom Homan, who is central casting.
[00:09:24.098 --> 00:09:24.958]  He's central cast.
[00:09:25.858 --> 00:09:28.639]  And I'd like you to say a few words about the border.
[00:09:29.526 --> 00:09:33.348]  And who's going to solve that problem, and how quick are we going to do it, Tom?
[00:09:33.227 --> 00:09:34.227]  Go ahead, please.
[00:09:34.227 --> 00:09:45.986]   Look, I worked for six presidents, Donald Trump, Ronald Reagan, and every president
[00:09:45.986 --> 00:09:48.666]  I ever worked for did something to secure the border.
[00:09:49.018 --> 00:09:50.599]  But no one did more than President Trump.
[00:09:50.619 --> 00:09:52.059]  The most secure border in my lifetime.
[00:09:55.822 --> 00:09:57.743]  The most secure border we've ever seen.
[00:09:58.956 --> 00:10:00.357]  And Donald Trump's going to do it again.
[00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:04.400]  We're going to lock the border down, and we're going to protect Americans.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.303]  Because what's happening at the border right now, a record number of Americans have died from fentanyl poisoning.
[00:10:08.323 --> 00:10:10.004]  A record number of migrants have died.
[00:10:10.505 --> 00:10:12.766]  A record number of women and children have been sex trafficked.
[00:10:12.806 --> 00:10:15.108]  A record number of known suspected terrorists have crossed the border.
[00:10:15.468 --> 00:10:19.731]  There's one man who's proven he can secure the border, and he's standing to my left.
[00:10:19.771 --> 00:10:20.472]  Donald J. Trump.
[00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:29.931]  properties won't do it again.
[00:10:29.861 --> 00:10:39.589]  This is an evening that I will not forget because it's the third time, but more importantly, I think it's going to be, I think it's going to be the most important time.
[00:10:40.089 --> 00:10:41.690]  We won both.
[00:10:42.051 --> 00:10:48.116]  It was, I think they said, somebody said you rarely, if you win both, they've never had a loser.
[00:10:48.216 --> 00:10:49.156]  Let me put it that way.
[00:10:49.657 --> 00:10:54.000]  When you win Iowa and you win New Hampshire, they've never had a loss.
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:54.661]  There's never been.
[00:10:54.741 --> 00:10:56.402]  So we're not going to be the first.
[00:10:56.482 --> 00:10:57.083]  I can tell you.
[00:10:57.663 --> 00:11:00.724]  And I just, I just do want to reiterate the polls.
[00:11:01.425 --> 00:11:02.725]  We're way up on everybody.
[00:11:02.965 --> 00:11:04.146]  We're way up on Biden.
[00:11:04.726 --> 00:11:12.409]  And over the last couple of months, if you check, and you have to remember, in 2016, they were saying, oh, what does he know about elections?
[00:11:12.429 --> 00:11:13.069]  He's not going to win.
[00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:13.510]  He can't win.
[00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:13.750]  He can't.
[00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:14.230]  We won.
[00:11:15.438 --> 00:11:20.201]  And we got millions and you can check this and I hope the cameras don't turn off because they hate this.
[00:11:20.281 --> 00:11:23.943]  But we got millions and millions of more votes the second time.
[00:11:24.303 --> 00:11:25.444]  Right, Mr. Congressman?
[00:11:26.224 --> 00:11:28.205]  Millions and millions of more votes.
[00:11:29.066 --> 00:11:33.668]  And but we had COVID and they used COVID to cheat and they did a lot of other things, too.
[00:11:34.669 --> 00:11:36.130]  We're not going to let that happen.
[00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.251]  And that's still and that's still going along.
[00:11:38.291 --> 00:11:38.831]  We don't forget.
[00:11:38.871 --> 00:11:48.284]   You can never forget history because if you forget You never, you never recover from it and you repeat, you repeat and we're not going to repeat.
[00:11:49.044 --> 00:11:51.965]  We're going to have the greatest election success.
[00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.686]  We're going to turn our country around.
[00:11:53.706 --> 00:12:05.633]   And if you take a look throughout the history of our country, if you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of this Not great country right now.
[00:12:06.353 --> 00:12:07.614]  It's a country in decline.
[00:12:07.795 --> 00:12:08.895]  It's a troubled country.
[00:12:09.556 --> 00:12:11.057]  It's a failing country, frankly.
[00:12:11.817 --> 00:12:19.363]  But if you took the 10 worst presidents and put them together, the 10 worst, absolutely 10 worst, I used to say five.
[00:12:19.423 --> 00:12:20.844]  Remember I said I'd say five.
[00:12:21.184 --> 00:12:23.446]  Then I said, wait a minute, we can add another five.
[00:12:23.966 --> 00:12:25.567]  They would not have done the damage.
[00:12:26.638 --> 00:12:30.840]  That crooked Joe Biden has done to our wonderful country.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.580]  They would not have done the damage.
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.461]  There's never been anything like it.
[00:12:34.701 --> 00:12:37.282]  And you say, are they stupid people?
[00:12:38.042 --> 00:12:41.283]  I don't think so, because nobody can cheat that well if they're stupid.
[00:12:42.004 --> 00:12:43.184]  Do they hate our country?
[00:12:43.664 --> 00:12:50.786]   They must hate our country because there's no other reason That they can be doing the things they do.
[00:12:51.506 --> 00:12:52.066]  Take a look.
[00:12:52.946 --> 00:12:55.707]  The taxes, they want to raise your taxes times four.
[00:12:56.327 --> 00:13:01.989]  They want to let the Trump tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country, they want them to expire.
[00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:04.350]  Your taxes are going to go through the roof.
[00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.290]  You take a look at regulations.
[00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.531]  They're throwing regulations.
[00:13:07.551 --> 00:13:08.311]  You can't breathe.
[00:13:08.351 --> 00:13:10.892]  You can't even breathe with what they're doing.
[00:13:11.392 --> 00:13:12.652]  You take a look at our border.
[00:13:12.992 --> 00:13:13.492]  So bad.
[00:13:13.532 --> 00:13:15.513]  There's never been a border like this in the world.
[00:13:16.909 --> 00:13:21.572]  Four years ago, we had the safest, best border in the United States.
[00:13:22.112 --> 00:13:24.333]  I built hundreds of miles of border wall.
[00:13:25.133 --> 00:13:27.014]  And they always say, oh, he didn't build hundreds of miles.
[00:13:27.094 --> 00:13:31.217]  Because if there's a board laying on the ground, they say that's a renovation.
[00:13:31.317 --> 00:13:32.397]  They call it a renovation.
[00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:36.519]  If there's two nails laying from 50 years ago, they say, oh, that was a renovation.
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.502]  These are very dishonest people, and you're always fighting them.
[00:13:41.182 --> 00:13:42.623]  And just a little note to Nikki.
[00:13:43.735 --> 00:13:44.435]  She's not gonna win.
[00:13:46.596 --> 00:13:52.017]  But if she did, she would be under investigation by those people in 15 minutes.
[00:13:52.077 --> 00:13:54.198]  And I could tell you five reasons why already.
[00:13:55.618 --> 00:13:56.478]  Not big reasons.
[00:13:57.318 --> 00:13:59.619]  A little stuff that she doesn't want to talk about.
[00:13:59.999 --> 00:14:02.580]  But she will be under investigation within minutes.
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.020]  And so would Ron have been.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.341]  But he decided to get out.
[00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:08.921]  He decided to get out.
[00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:11.962]  Now Vivek I don't think would be at all because he's perfect, right?
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.701]  And Tim Scott, I know, would never.
[00:14:16.761 --> 00:14:17.582]  That's no chance.
[00:14:18.902 --> 00:14:20.283]  Hey Tim, do you want to say something?
[00:14:20.423 --> 00:14:20.743]  Come on.
[00:14:20.983 --> 00:14:21.284]  Come on.
[00:14:21.404 --> 00:14:26.086]  I want him to say something.
[00:14:27.207 --> 00:14:27.927]  New Hampshire!
[00:14:29.188 --> 00:14:35.911]  The President said a double-digit win in New Hampshire, and you delivered a double-digit win for President Trump!
[00:14:37.732 --> 00:14:42.515]  But I'm going to invite you to my home state starting tomorrow!
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:56.485]  Where this election is over, it is time for the Republican Party to coalesce around our nominee and the next president of the United States, Donald Trump!
[00:14:56.946 --> 00:14:59.507]  Let's get that party started tonight!
[00:15:03.468 --> 00:15:04.469]  What a good guy.
[00:15:05.769 --> 00:15:06.890]  What a good man he is.
[00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:13.207]  But just remember, I did hear Nikki say, and now it's off to South Carolina.
[00:15:13.247 --> 00:15:15.548]  Well, I love South Carolina.
[00:15:16.589 --> 00:15:16.989]  I love it.
[00:15:17.029 --> 00:15:18.590]  But you know, she forgot one thing.
[00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:20.230]  She forgot one thing.
[00:15:21.471 --> 00:15:22.651]  Next week, it's Nevada.
[00:15:23.792 --> 00:15:24.912]  Next week, it's Nevada.
[00:15:24.932 --> 00:15:25.913]  It's not South Carolina.
[00:15:25.953 --> 00:15:26.893]  We love South Carolina.
[00:15:26.913 --> 00:15:28.394]  But next week, it's Nevada.
[00:15:29.074 --> 00:15:31.515]  And I'm pleased to announce we just won Nevada. 100%.
[00:15:36.092 --> 00:15:45.236]  Because all of them, they looked at it, and they took polls, and I was polling at 95% to 4 or 5%, and they decided not to play in Nevada.
[00:15:45.856 --> 00:15:47.457]  So we just won Nevada.
[00:15:47.477 --> 00:15:54.720]  We have a man from Nevada here, Steve Wynn, wherever he may be, and John Paulson, the great John Paulson, made plenty of money in Nevada.
[00:15:55.782 --> 00:15:56.443]  Does he live there?
[00:15:56.483 --> 00:15:57.986]  But he makes a hell of a lot of money.
[00:15:58.026 --> 00:15:59.849]  He makes money everywhere he goes, actually.
[00:15:59.869 --> 00:16:01.451]  It's a money machine.
[00:16:01.471 --> 00:16:03.715]  Maybe we'll put you... You know what?
[00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:05.237]  Put him at Treasury!
[00:16:05.277 --> 00:16:06.339]  You want to make a little money?
[00:16:06.379 --> 00:16:06.680]  Let's put...
[00:16:07.859 --> 00:16:08.679]  Anyways, good.
[00:16:08.799 --> 00:16:09.580]  Good to have you guys.
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.941]  But we go to Nevada, and that's been one.
[00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:15.661]  So we pick up all of those delegates.
[00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:19.903]  And then we do go to South Carolina, where we've done really well, where I've done well.
[00:16:19.943 --> 00:16:25.604]  We have a great governor and lieutenant governor and great everything, because almost every one of them have endorsed me.
[00:16:26.245 --> 00:16:28.545]  Two great senators, which is hard.
[00:16:28.645 --> 00:16:32.787]  I mean, did you ever think that she actually appointed you, Tim?
[00:16:34.366 --> 00:16:41.232]  And, think of it, appointed and you're the senator of his state and she endorsed me.
[00:16:42.613 --> 00:16:43.714]  You must really hate her.
[00:16:46.076 --> 00:16:46.336]  No.
[00:16:46.596 --> 00:16:47.137]  It's a shame.
[00:16:47.277 --> 00:16:47.837]  It's a shame.
[00:16:48.157 --> 00:16:48.898]  Uh-oh.
[00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:51.560]  I just love you.
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.061]  No, that's why he's a great politician.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.579]  That's why he's a great politician.
[00:16:54.579 --> 00:16:57.300]  That's why he's a great politician.
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:04.339]   So this is a great evening and it is, you know, we are going to Nevada for a little while.
[00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:05.745]  We're not going to have to do too much.
[00:17:05.785 --> 00:17:10.170]  We have a great team there, but it's a team that we can now send someplace else.
[00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:15.775]  They did a fantastic job, and it's a fantastic place, really a fantastic place.
[00:17:15.815 --> 00:17:17.757]  But we'll be leaving there very quickly.
[00:17:17.777 --> 00:17:20.840]  We'll head out to South Carolina, where I think we're going to win easily.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.281]  I think we're 50 points up, 5-0.
[00:17:24.195 --> 00:17:26.697]  50 points up on a person that was governor.
[00:17:26.717 --> 00:17:27.718]  That tells you something.
[00:17:28.379 --> 00:17:35.504]  But I felt I should do this because I find in life you can't let people get away with bullshit, okay?
[00:17:35.584 --> 00:17:35.984]  You can't.
[00:17:36.485 --> 00:17:37.445]  You just can't do that.
[00:17:38.706 --> 00:17:44.606]   And when I watched her in the fancy dress that probably wasn't so fancy, Come up.
[00:17:44.666 --> 00:17:45.607]  I said, what's she doing?
[00:17:45.687 --> 00:17:46.128]  We won.
[00:17:47.168 --> 00:17:49.771]  And she did the same thing last week.
[00:17:50.471 --> 00:17:52.693]  But he was much more angry about it than I was.
[00:17:52.833 --> 00:17:56.636]  I said, get up there and you let him know we are going to win this.
[00:17:56.857 --> 00:17:58.478]  We have no choice if we don't win.
[00:17:58.498 --> 00:18:01.040]  I think our country is finished.
[00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:01.941]  I do.
[00:18:02.241 --> 00:18:03.822]  I believe our country is finished.
[00:18:04.803 --> 00:18:07.365]  We have an opportunity to do something.
[00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:09.037]  So amazing.
[00:18:09.177 --> 00:18:19.720]  And the good news and the reason we have such support, the best numbers I've ever had, the reason we have support is because they are so bad at what they're doing and so evil.
[00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:22.141]  And they're destroying our country.
[00:18:22.661 --> 00:18:26.582]  So I want to thank, I want to thank everybody for being here.
[00:18:26.642 --> 00:18:28.823]  I want to thank this group of people.
[00:18:29.983 --> 00:18:31.204]  We will never forget you.
[00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:32.484]  We will never forget.
[00:18:33.865 --> 00:18:34.805]  And I made a pledge.
[00:18:37.916 --> 00:18:43.888]  I made a pledge to your state that you have the highest energy costs in the country.
[00:18:44.904 --> 00:18:48.406]  In the first year, they're going to be reduced by 50%.
[00:18:49.866 --> 00:18:53.028]  Because we are going to drill, baby, drill.
[00:18:53.828 --> 00:18:55.849]  Drill, baby, drill.
[00:18:55.989 --> 00:18:58.270]  Inflation's going to come way down.
[00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:03.753]  But in the first year, your energy costs are going down by 50%.
[00:19:04.193 --> 00:19:06.834]  Thank you very much.
[00:19:06.954 --> 00:19:07.574]  We love you.
[00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:08.775]  Thank you very much.
[00:19:09.375 --> 00:19:10.235]  We'll see you soon.
[00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:12.136]  We'll see you on the trail.
[00:19:12.616 --> 00:19:13.796]  And thank you, everybody.
[00:19:13.916 --> 00:19:14.777]  Thank you very much.
[00:19:15.977 --> 00:19:17.217]  We will see you on the trail.
[00:19:17.697 --> 00:19:18.017]  Thanks.
[00:19:19.438 --> 00:19:30.141]  On her way to work one morning, down the path, along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake.
[00:19:31.901 --> 00:19:34.902]  Her pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew.
[00:19:35.602 --> 00:19:37.643]  Poor thing, she cried, I'll take you in.
[00:19:38.735 --> 00:19:39.957]  And I'll take care of you.
[00:19:41.278 --> 00:19:44.222]  Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.
[00:19:45.344 --> 00:19:48.889]  Take me in, oh tender woman, cried the vicious snake.
[00:19:49.972 --> 00:19:56.358]  She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk, and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk.
[00:19:57.019 --> 00:20:05.968]  She hurried home from work that night, and soon as she arrived, she found the pretty snake she'd taken in hadn't revived.
[00:20:06.588 --> 00:20:08.470]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[00:20:08.991 --> 00:20:10.372]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[00:20:10.872 --> 00:20:12.294]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[00:20:12.834 --> 00:20:14.196]  Sighed the vicious snake.
[00:20:15.273 --> 00:20:16.854]  She clutched him to her bosom.
[00:20:17.795 --> 00:20:19.777]  You're so beautiful, she cried.
[00:20:20.497 --> 00:20:24.160]  But if I hadn't brought you in by now, you truly would have died.
[00:20:25.061 --> 00:20:29.104]  She stroked his pretty skin again and kissed him and held him tight.
[00:20:29.905 --> 00:20:36.310]  But instead of saying thank you, ma'am, the snake gave her a vicious bite.
[00:20:38.908 --> 00:20:41.831]  Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.
[00:20:42.391 --> 00:20:45.113]  Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake.
[00:20:46.335 --> 00:20:51.639]  I saved you, cried the woman, and you've bitten me, but why?
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:57.404]  You know your bite is poisonous, and now I'm going to die.
[00:20:58.923 --> 00:21:03.724]  Shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin.
[00:21:04.424 --> 00:21:09.585]  You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.
[00:21:09.605 --> 00:21:20.847]  Does that remind you of anything?
[00:21:20.867 --> 00:21:21.468]  Be ready.
[00:21:21.988 --> 00:21:22.588]  Be ready.
[00:21:23.488 --> 00:21:28.349]  Because what they're allowing into our country is very, very bad.
[00:21:32.222 --> 00:21:38.026]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:21:38.526 --> 00:21:42.526]  Visit Infowars.com/show and share the link today.
[00:21:42.526 --> 00:21:51.526]  [music]
[00:21:51.526 --> 00:21:55.526]  It's Wednesday, January 24th, 2024.
[00:21:55.526 --> 00:21:57.526]  385 days.
[00:21:57.526 --> 00:22:04.526]   12 hours, 51 minutes, 30 seconds to the most important election in world history.
[00:22:04.919 --> 00:22:12.862]  Just as important as the shot heard around the world that triggered the 1776 moment and the birth of our republic.
[00:22:14.842 --> 00:22:17.663]  Well, nobody can say we don't live in incredibly interesting times.
[00:22:18.304 --> 00:22:19.364]  Got a bunch of guests today.
[00:22:21.079 --> 00:22:23.661]  The governor's office has responded in Colorado.
[00:22:24.201 --> 00:22:28.203]  They've had a bunch of news pieces attack us and say that we're liars, but then they basically admit it.
[00:22:28.784 --> 00:22:37.009]  That they're injecting people with live attenuated Ebola that can still make people with lower immune systems really sick and that can be shed and spread.
[00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:40.411]  And we simply pointed it out with medical doctor Dr. Richard Bartlett.
[00:22:41.465 --> 00:22:53.952]  Last Friday, and covered mainstream news and the controversy starting to break in Colorado about it, and they tried to come out and say it's something I made up, and that my new target's the hospital there.
[00:22:53.972 --> 00:23:04.417]  I'm not saying the hospital's doing all this, I'm saying the federal project and the bio lab nearby testing Ebola on different animals.
[00:23:04.457 --> 00:23:05.838]  This is all confirmed.
[00:23:07.608 --> 00:23:15.051]  The same corporate media that attacks us for saying the shot wouldn't protect you and that the virus did come out of a lab, we've all been proven right.
[00:23:16.091 --> 00:23:21.813]  That same corporate media is lying to you yet again.
[00:23:22.273 --> 00:23:24.634]  So he should be popping in at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:23:25.814 --> 00:23:32.777]  Viva Fry, great lawyer, great talk show host, will be joining us coming up in about 22 minutes from now.
[00:23:34.275 --> 00:23:58.475]  Huge ruling by the federal court, the Supreme Court up in Canada, dealing with the fact that Trudeau and the horses running over families and arresting thousands of people and putting people in jail, in some cases for a year, for peacefully protesting the ongoing lockdown and grabbing their bank accounts at the direction of the WEF as a model of control was illegal.
[00:23:59.796 --> 00:24:03.459]  That's a big deal and that ties into the trucker protests and farmer protests in Europe.
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:13.706]  The UK, Ireland, Scotland, and now big convoys being organized from all over the United States that are about to be launched very soon.
[00:24:14.826 --> 00:24:19.509]  One of them being organized out of a suburb of Austin, Tripping Springs.
[00:24:19.649 --> 00:24:29.795]  And we've got the gentleman involved in that, one of the coordinators, joining us in studio in the third hour today.
[00:24:31.156 --> 00:24:34.018]  All right, Trump annihilated Big Bird.
[00:24:35.222 --> 00:24:40.867]  Or Birdbrainer, the Queen of War, whatever you want to call Nikki Haley.
[00:24:42.689 --> 00:24:57.062]  He won by 11 points despite the fact, and I have the mainstream news here admitting it and the exit numbers, more Democrats voted than Republicans.
[00:24:58.743 --> 00:25:16.500]   So they, More people that did not identify as Republican, most of that group being Democrats, flooded in at an all-time record level, they call it strategic voting, it's called fraud, to not actually vote for Nikki Haley for President, but to stop Trump.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:33.538]   So despite the fact that many of the polling places in New Hampshire ran out of the party crossover forms and had to make new ones with a copying machine, despite them even coming in from out of state to do it, Which is what Democrats do.
[00:25:33.958 --> 00:25:37.120]  Crime is their modus operandi.
[00:25:38.521 --> 00:25:47.226]  Despite all of that, Trump won by 53% of the vote.
[00:25:51.989 --> 00:25:56.548]   that's a different poll right there but that's he he he won by eleven eleven
[00:25:56.548 --> 00:25:58.629]   points uh... there
[00:25:58.629 --> 00:26:01.629]   uh... in new hampshire
[00:26:01.629 --> 00:26:04.248]   that's a big deal because it was rigged as hell go.
[00:26:04.248 --> 00:26:14.249]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:26:05.318 --> 00:26:08.320]  Trump defeats Haley in New Hampshire GOP primary.
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:17.927]  Donald Trump is now the only person to ever win the New Hampshire primary three times.
[00:26:18.668 --> 00:26:28.215]  Fox News reports Nikki Birdbrain Haley vows to fight on after New Hampshire with all of her corporate donors and funding.
[00:26:29.517 --> 00:26:33.300]  Another way to just drain Trump from funds and make him campaign against her.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.861]  That's why he was so pissed off last night.
[00:26:35.681 --> 00:26:36.582]  He should be pissed off.
[00:26:36.622 --> 00:26:38.243]  The fraud is just unbelievable.
[00:26:38.983 --> 00:26:43.106]  Got a bunch of videos of Democrats bragging how they crossed over strategically.
[00:26:43.266 --> 00:26:44.507]  It was a strategic vote.
[00:26:44.607 --> 00:26:47.729]  I wouldn't vote for him or for her in a general election.
[00:26:47.749 --> 00:26:51.892]  A vote for Haley helps diminish Trump's influence.
[00:26:52.733 --> 00:26:54.994]  So they're very proud of themselves.
[00:26:55.195 --> 00:26:58.257]  Chris Payne had a really good nuclear rant on Biden.
[00:26:59.147 --> 00:27:01.528]  Last night, defense of Trump and voters.
[00:27:01.568 --> 00:27:04.870]  I want to get to that coming up because he really spells it out.
[00:27:05.651 --> 00:27:06.832]  And we need to understand this.
[00:27:06.852 --> 00:27:09.713]  In fact, let's air that first right now.
[00:27:10.274 --> 00:27:12.335]  These people really do hate you, OK?
[00:27:12.915 --> 00:27:15.317]  And I don't care if you're brown or black or white.
[00:27:18.358 --> 00:27:27.824]  If you don't want to serve their new world order and be their minion and take all their poison shots and cut your children's genitals off, they literally hate you.
[00:27:29.687 --> 00:27:32.889]  They hate common people and they're trying to divide us against each other.
[00:27:33.369 --> 00:27:44.996]  Once I play that short clip, I'm going to play the most amazing clip of the amazing stuff that's come out of Kerry Lake in Arizona.
[00:27:45.817 --> 00:27:49.419]  And again, the woman running the election was running against her for governor.
[00:27:49.439 --> 00:27:50.279]  We know they stole it.
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:51.740]  Completely obvious.
[00:27:52.601 --> 00:27:55.022]  And they've been caught in all sorts of corruption since and trying to cover it up.
[00:27:55.583 --> 00:28:00.887]   But now we have the head of the Republican Party, In the state.
[00:28:02.869 --> 00:28:05.311]  Telling her, we got the East Coast money here.
[00:28:05.511 --> 00:28:07.993]  Anything you want, baby.
[00:28:08.893 --> 00:28:10.454]  Any amount of money, you're gonna get it.
[00:28:10.574 --> 00:28:12.516]  Don't run for the Senate.
[00:28:14.778 --> 00:28:18.680]  And she talked about this a few months ago, and people said, oh, you don't, she didn't say his name.
[00:28:19.181 --> 00:28:21.662]  She said, I've had big money come and try to buy me out.
[00:28:21.682 --> 00:28:23.923]  People said, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:28:23.943 --> 00:28:27.485]  So she's released the tape, and then the whole tape's like an hour long.
[00:28:27.525 --> 00:28:30.147]  We're like, the clip's six minutes long here.
[00:28:30.867 --> 00:28:34.930]  But it's just so incredible because this is how they buy and sell people.
[00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:38.212]  And this is illegal as hell.
[00:28:39.281 --> 00:28:45.405]  He's trying to get someone to not run, which is the same thing we're doing with Trump, trying to take him off the ballot, all these indictments.
[00:28:45.905 --> 00:28:58.033]  The most pure form of election fraud and election theft and election meddling is when you try to block somebody for running with a fake indictment or you buy them off.
[00:29:00.154 --> 00:29:03.557]  And it's incredible.
[00:29:04.537 --> 00:29:07.944]   Now, if a private citizen, I've looked at the law, Did this.
[00:29:08.444 --> 00:29:09.385]  It's still a conspiracy.
[00:29:09.425 --> 00:29:10.186]  They could be indicted.
[00:29:10.767 --> 00:29:23.702]  But when you have a Republican official who has all these duties and rules and regulations reportedly promising to be part of a fair election system, it's serious fraud.
[00:29:24.878 --> 00:29:37.308]  Arizona Senate candidate Carrie Lake called on the state's GOP chair Jeff DeWitt to resign after a recording emerged of him trying to bribe her to stay out of politics for two years.
[00:29:37.929 --> 00:29:44.474]  And then of course they back her after that, and the best part is, she's like, you want me to join the Globalist?
[00:29:44.494 --> 00:29:45.035]  And he goes, yes.
[00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.471]  She goes, you know, just get on the team.
[00:29:48.591 --> 00:29:50.951]  And she goes, will they be on my team or?
[00:29:50.971 --> 00:29:53.852]  She goes, no, join their team.
[00:29:55.713 --> 00:29:57.054]  Join with Sauron.
[00:29:58.094 --> 00:29:58.834]  Join with Satan.
[00:30:00.435 --> 00:30:07.157]  And I've named names before, the few times Globalist said it in front of people.
[00:30:08.249 --> 00:30:14.392]  And it was an off-record meeting, but I've had many other off-record meetings I've told you a lot about where they say, you don't want to be on this crusade going nowhere.
[00:30:14.892 --> 00:30:16.392]  The system can protect you.
[00:30:16.432 --> 00:30:19.234]  You want to be a star.
[00:30:19.454 --> 00:30:21.995]  And you'll have a table, place the table with us.
[00:30:22.915 --> 00:30:24.276]  You'll have more influence with us.
[00:30:24.316 --> 00:30:27.397]  You can still bring a lot of your ideas, but you'll just be on the team.
[00:30:27.877 --> 00:30:34.600]  How many times have I told you the speech where they say, join the team, get a place on the team, get a place at the table.
[00:30:35.926 --> 00:30:37.027]  It's a direct pitch.
[00:30:37.067 --> 00:30:41.248]  I've told these stories hundreds of times with exactly what he said to her.
[00:30:43.009 --> 00:30:45.490]  Come on Kerry, join the team.
[00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:48.171]  Make it about you.
[00:30:48.871 --> 00:30:59.055]  And then in two years after we've defeated Trump, and we've secured control, we will run you and you can be a political leader.
[00:31:00.899 --> 00:31:04.722]  But don't tell anybody about this, or then the opportunity goes away.
[00:31:04.742 --> 00:31:09.346]  And he comes over, he goes, listen, listen, don't, listen, just come on.
[00:31:09.646 --> 00:31:13.510]  And she's so slick, she's eating carrots or something, you can hear her.
[00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:17.873]  I mean, you know, a woman like that, who wants super good shape and everything, she's probably eating carrots or celery.
[00:31:18.314 --> 00:31:20.576]  And she's sitting there munching on carrots or celery or something.
[00:31:21.056 --> 00:31:24.339]  And she's, oh yeah, getting him to out himself.
[00:31:25.834 --> 00:31:30.455]  And he's just there like a snake up against her ear, whispering in.
[00:31:30.495 --> 00:31:33.316]  But most of these people take the bait.
[00:31:34.136 --> 00:31:36.237]  She didn't get into this because she wanted to be a political leader.
[00:31:36.257 --> 00:31:38.458]  She got into this because she said it, and I believe it.
[00:31:38.498 --> 00:31:38.818]  It's true.
[00:31:38.838 --> 00:31:40.198]  You can see it in her actions.
[00:31:41.418 --> 00:31:43.899]  She's really fundamentally pissed off about the structure of the country.
[00:31:44.419 --> 00:31:49.020]  And by the way, where's our money going to be any good to spend with what they're doing to it?
[00:31:49.161 --> 00:31:50.721]  I mean, that's another thing to all these billionaires.
[00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:54.082]  Like, they're all building big giant bunkers and hide in the middle of nowhere.
[00:31:55.666 --> 00:32:11.434]  All because they had to take over and set up this new world order and this horrible dystopia with robots and drones and the Davos groups announcing microchips to buy and sell and we'll all wear brain scanner earpieces that report to our boss what we're thinking supposedly.
[00:32:11.554 --> 00:32:26.768]   I mean they're just trying to normalize such a horrible dystopic system but they've got 88% of all the money and assets in the world so most people At least the management positions take the money.
[00:32:28.369 --> 00:32:33.412]  But then the money and the success you're going to have is short-lived as everything falls apart.
[00:32:34.173 --> 00:32:40.836]  Because it's been the free market, non-corrupt, laissez-faire, open system of competition to create all this wealth.
[00:32:41.417 --> 00:32:51.502]  Well now they're just showing it up and greedily sucking up the last pools of any success that anybody else has because they want to consolidate control.
[00:32:51.542 --> 00:33:01.640]   The world's just full Of these toadies that would slide in there and say, hey, name your number.
[00:33:01.881 --> 00:33:04.302]  And by the way, we'll put you in power in two years.
[00:33:05.163 --> 00:33:06.344]  You want to be governor down the road?
[00:33:06.504 --> 00:33:06.844]  It's you.
[00:33:07.645 --> 00:33:08.325]  Whatever you want.
[00:33:09.086 --> 00:33:11.167]  I listened to the full recording or most of it.
[00:33:11.788 --> 00:33:13.209]  I listened to like 35 minutes of it.
[00:33:13.229 --> 00:33:15.150]  I got like 20 minutes left or something.
[00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:19.974]  But I'm going to play just like a five minute clip of this in a moment.
[00:33:20.674 --> 00:33:27.504]   But first, because I mentioned it, here's the clip of Charles Payne was one of the best hosts left at Fox.
[00:33:27.544 --> 00:33:27.864]  Here he is.
[00:33:28.564 --> 00:33:29.685]  That's the way I grew up in Harlem.
[00:33:29.705 --> 00:33:31.625]  Not as a country's at stake, right?
[00:33:31.685 --> 00:33:35.787]  He won, he became President of the United States with that same personality.
[00:33:36.307 --> 00:33:40.009]  I don't think that, you know, listen, I think it's worse with Biden calling MAGA.
[00:33:40.349 --> 00:33:48.393]  Biden's anger and vitriol and hatred for MAGA is far more worse than President Trump's individual battles with someone who crosses him.
[00:33:49.033 --> 00:33:51.774]  That is something that is really detrimental to this country.
[00:33:52.094 --> 00:33:55.936]  That the President of the United States despises half of the United States.
[00:33:56.236 --> 00:34:02.379]  President Biden, I said earlier today, just about a week ago, I had a segment coming up so I googled, Biden hates MAGA.
[00:34:03.179 --> 00:34:05.961]  Nothing but articles, after articles, after articles.
[00:34:06.181 --> 00:34:08.342]  He has expressed hatred for who's in the country.
[00:34:08.462 --> 00:34:09.342]  I love writing those articles.
[00:34:09.382 --> 00:34:10.603]  It doesn't matter, look at it.
[00:34:10.643 --> 00:34:11.043]  And it's not.
[00:34:11.703 --> 00:34:13.605]  Because the bottom line is he says it.
[00:34:13.945 --> 00:34:15.246]  He has vitriol for them.
[00:34:15.586 --> 00:34:19.929]  And so does MSNBC, and so does CNN, and so does the New York Times.
[00:34:20.169 --> 00:34:22.330]  They have vitriol for half of the nation.
[00:34:22.531 --> 00:34:25.573]  They don't look at them like fellow Americans, and it's unfortunate.
[00:34:25.793 --> 00:34:27.614]  They try to paint them as racist.
[00:34:27.754 --> 00:34:34.378]  All the things that they do to their fellow Americans who simply want a safe home, a safe community, for their children to have prosperity.
[00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:37.841]  They want the same thing, but they demean them all the time.
[00:34:37.901 --> 00:34:41.203]  That's why I think Phillips was so intriguing, because he went to a rally.
[00:34:42.403 --> 00:34:51.045]  Yeah, go to a Trump rally.
[00:34:51.065 --> 00:34:52.485]  There's some really cool people.
[00:34:53.985 --> 00:34:56.026]  Especially if you're black and want to go find out.
[00:34:56.046 --> 00:34:58.646]  You're going to go, well, there's a lot of black people here and everybody's really cool.
[00:34:59.246 --> 00:35:00.266]  Yeah, folks, it's all a lie.
[00:35:00.306 --> 00:35:05.187]  We just want prosperity and freedom and a right to self-defense and a right to not murder babies.
[00:35:06.767 --> 00:35:09.688]  Now I want to challenge you to go to InfoWars.com and get the full article.
[00:35:10.626 --> 00:35:16.068]  Because it's got the full audio that she put out, unedited, so you can't claim it's, you know, manipulated.
[00:35:16.448 --> 00:35:20.609]  Then it's got shorter clips out there, people who don't have an hour to listen to it all.
[00:35:21.129 --> 00:35:25.990]  It's got a bunch of comments and points, you know, made by other people on X that are excellent.
[00:35:27.151 --> 00:35:35.494]   But before this guy resigns, da twit, He needs to release who the big guys are on the East Coast.
[00:35:35.534 --> 00:35:36.175]  We know who they are.
[00:35:36.195 --> 00:35:37.455]  It's Chuckie Schumer, folks.
[00:35:38.376 --> 00:35:38.996]  It's Obama.
[00:35:39.036 --> 00:35:40.036]  It's the Democratic Party.
[00:35:40.076 --> 00:35:40.797]  It's the big money.
[00:35:43.118 --> 00:35:44.699]  And she starts, you know, saying, well, what kind of money?
[00:35:44.759 --> 00:35:46.720]  Well, you know, you name it.
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:52.703]  If she could have asked for $20 million, she'd have got it.
[00:35:52.723 --> 00:35:54.964]  And they go, oh, and we'll give you a big job at a corporation.
[00:35:54.984 --> 00:35:56.584]  You don't have to do anything.
[00:35:58.685 --> 00:35:59.706]  That's how real bribes work.
[00:36:01.152 --> 00:36:03.634]  They just give people jobs or their wives or husband jobs.
[00:36:04.594 --> 00:36:05.475]  That's how it works, folks.
[00:36:06.956 --> 00:36:08.016]  And look, all your problems are over.
[00:36:09.057 --> 00:36:10.438]  Everything you want, you're gonna have it all right now.
[00:36:11.618 --> 00:36:16.501]  Mr. Jones, we'll give you $20 million a year, two book deals a year, everything will be handled.
[00:36:17.102 --> 00:36:18.443]  You just sign up with us right now.
[00:36:18.883 --> 00:36:20.104]  You're gonna be the next Rush Limbaugh.
[00:36:23.286 --> 00:36:26.227]  An hour later, what do I need to do, Mr. Jones, to get you to sign on?
[00:36:26.848 --> 00:36:27.468]  You like my wife?
[00:36:27.688 --> 00:36:28.509]  She's pretty hot, isn't she?
[00:36:29.209 --> 00:36:29.910]  She likes you a lot.
[00:36:30.699 --> 00:36:32.699]  Want my wife right now?
[00:36:32.699 --> 00:36:42.338]   I had a big news publisher writer, this is like 15 years ago now, 13 years ago,
[00:36:42.338 --> 00:36:45.019]  come interview me in a profile.
[00:36:45.985 --> 00:36:50.606]  And at the end of it, the guy basically reveals he works for the CIA.
[00:36:50.987 --> 00:36:56.729]  I says, if I couldn't figure that out by the middle of the interviews, and he just gets on his knees and says, Obama likes you.
[00:36:58.223 --> 00:36:59.364]  And he wants you to work with us.
[00:36:59.384 --> 00:37:01.507]  Just please, is there anything I can do?
[00:37:03.449 --> 00:37:06.072]  And I really think he thought I was about to pull my pants down, folks.
[00:37:06.112 --> 00:37:06.733]  And I'm not joking.
[00:37:06.993 --> 00:37:12.560]  You see things like Team America, where he goes, now get down there, Gary, and suck my... It's not about sex, Gary.
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:17.606]  These people are whacked out of their minds.
[00:37:18.601 --> 00:37:20.122]  And it's all about power with them.
[00:37:20.442 --> 00:37:28.848]  They get power in the system, and those under them have to do what they say, and it's sex, it's money, it's control, it's... Harvey Weinstein's just the tip of the iceberg, folks.
[00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:37.275]  He didn't want to have sex with women, he wanted to dominate and rape a woman at least every day, because he was a monster.
[00:37:38.375 --> 00:37:39.096]  And where is he now?
[00:37:40.417 --> 00:37:41.458]  These are crazy people.
[00:37:43.239 --> 00:37:46.761]  I'm lusting after a steak and a big salad driving home at night, and to...
[00:37:48.157 --> 00:37:49.658]  You'll play a board game with my daughter.
[00:37:49.678 --> 00:37:52.999]  You know, that's what I desire is to see a sunset.
[00:37:53.719 --> 00:37:57.601]  These people desire power over you and that's why they're so screwed up.
[00:37:59.202 --> 00:38:00.062]  Have I gone too far?
[00:38:00.082 --> 00:38:01.162]  I want to be able to play this full clip.
[00:38:01.182 --> 00:38:05.324]  We'll start the clip and we'll come back with more of it, but here he is openly trying to bribe her.
[00:38:06.765 --> 00:38:07.765]  So what's going on?
[00:38:07.865 --> 00:38:10.226]  What is, I'm assuming this is our friend.
[00:38:10.246 --> 00:38:13.968]  This is, this is, this is back east.
[00:38:15.481 --> 00:38:19.383]  They... There are very powerful people that want to keep you out.
[00:38:19.663 --> 00:38:20.644]  I know they do.
[00:38:21.844 --> 00:38:24.646]  But they're willing to put their money where their mouth is.
[00:38:25.206 --> 00:38:25.726]  In a big way.
[00:38:26.647 --> 00:38:29.188]  So, this conversation never happened.
[00:38:29.268 --> 00:38:30.288]  This is crazy though.
[00:38:30.809 --> 00:38:31.569]  They should want me.
[00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:33.550]  I'm a great candidate.
[00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:34.591]  People love me.
[00:38:35.771 --> 00:38:36.732]  These people are corrupt.
[00:38:37.812 --> 00:38:41.454]  Well, maybe you're right.
[00:38:41.574 --> 00:38:42.174]  They are corrupt.
[00:38:42.335 --> 00:38:43.415]  Maybe you are.
[00:38:43.435 --> 00:38:43.675]  Disappear.
[00:38:43.695 --> 00:38:43.995]  Don't go.
[00:38:43.835 --> 00:38:44.835]  And don't go.
[00:38:44.835 --> 00:38:46.835]  And if you ever go, I don't get myself in trouble.
[00:38:46.835 --> 00:38:50.835]  This, if you say no, which is fine, it's your choice.
[00:38:50.835 --> 00:38:51.835]  Don't tell people.
[00:38:52.201 --> 00:38:53.722]  They're going to try to have me murdered.
[00:38:54.742 --> 00:39:01.265]  That stuff that came out last week is right about the cartel stuff.
[00:39:01.285 --> 00:39:04.047]  The cartel is operating in 50 states right now.
[00:39:04.727 --> 00:39:07.608]  So what's going on?
[00:39:07.648 --> 00:39:08.048]  Who is it?
[00:39:08.068 --> 00:39:09.669]  Forget the who.
[00:39:09.729 --> 00:39:11.910]  Let me just tell you the what.
[00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:15.292]  Let's just say there are people calling around.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.322]  Yeah, it's not about ownership.
[00:39:19.142 --> 00:39:22.142]  You say no, don't say I got offered to buy out.
[00:39:22.142 --> 00:39:23.142]  Yeah.
[00:39:23.142 --> 00:39:27.142]   Because then we lose our ability to get things done in the future.
[00:39:27.142 --> 00:39:28.142]  Here's my problem.
[00:39:28.142 --> 00:39:30.142]  Rather than just say, let's work with her.
[00:39:30.142 --> 00:39:36.142]   She's a great candidate because they don't own me and it pisses me off.
[00:39:36.142 --> 00:39:39.142]  Yeah, I said ownership.
[00:39:39.142 --> 00:39:42.142]  It's about control.
[00:39:42.142 --> 00:39:44.142]  I know it's about control.
[00:39:44.142 --> 00:39:50.142]  It's about being on the team.
[00:39:50.045 --> 00:39:50.425]  Like I said.
[00:39:50.745 --> 00:39:51.205]  You know what I mean?
[00:39:51.225 --> 00:39:52.406]  They want to be on the team.
[00:39:53.806 --> 00:39:55.767]  They want you to be on their team.
[00:39:55.787 --> 00:39:56.067]  Just team.
[00:39:56.887 --> 00:39:57.168]  You know?
[00:39:57.208 --> 00:39:59.449]  But if they're pushing a globalist agenda, I can't do that.
[00:40:00.129 --> 00:40:00.809]  So what do they want?
[00:40:00.849 --> 00:40:01.629]  What do they want me to do?
[00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:03.570]  They want you to stay opportunist.
[00:40:07.132 --> 00:40:08.732]  But, let me tell you what I can offer you.
[00:40:12.094 --> 00:40:16.123]   But, Um, I said, "You can do whatever you want."
[00:40:16.123 --> 00:40:17.623]  He's talking head, isn't he?
[00:40:17.623 --> 00:40:20.822]  So, the ask of me was, it's kind of funny.
[00:40:20.822 --> 00:40:25.362]   So the ask I got today from back east was, this is, you guys can sit down.
[00:40:25.362 --> 00:40:29.663]   I said, "Is there any companies out there or something that could just put her on the payroll
[00:40:29.663 --> 00:40:31.302]  and give her, to keep her out?"
[00:40:31.302 --> 00:40:34.343]  And I said, "Well, what do you want them to do?"
[00:40:34.343 --> 00:40:35.601]  Whatever we need to do.
[00:40:35.601 --> 00:40:37.643]  This is about defeating Trump.
[00:40:37.643 --> 00:40:40.343]  And I think that's a bad, bad thing for our country.
[00:40:40.343 --> 00:40:50.342]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:40:41.395 --> 00:40:43.836]  DeSantis is not America first.
[00:40:44.936 --> 00:40:49.697]  This is about the final death blow to Trump.
[00:40:50.197 --> 00:40:51.778]  And I don't think that's good for our country.
[00:40:51.798 --> 00:40:52.178]  I love Trump.
[00:40:52.318 --> 00:40:53.638]  I love Trump.
[00:40:54.379 --> 00:40:55.659]  It's not good for our country, Jeff.
[00:40:57.179 --> 00:40:57.700]  It's not.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:03.681]  At the same time, I'm not even sure Trump can win again.
[00:41:03.701 --> 00:41:06.102]  I don't know if he can win again.
[00:41:07.662 --> 00:41:16.490]  I think what it really comes down to for a lot of people, it's not really about control or gender, it's just about the ability to raise money to win, you know?
[00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:20.733]  If you really want to know, all of politics falls under money.
[00:41:22.174 --> 00:41:24.296]  And even on their end, what makes them the most money?
[00:41:24.997 --> 00:41:29.160]  I know, all these consultants don't want their payday to end.
[00:41:29.961 --> 00:41:32.063]  And I don't want to make a deal with these kind of people.
[00:41:32.663 --> 00:41:34.245]  This is a hill worth dying on.
[00:41:35.968 --> 00:41:36.608]  I am not.
[00:41:36.728 --> 00:41:42.690]  If they're going to steal the election to make me and our movement go away, I'm not letting them do that.
[00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:43.950]  I owe it to the people of Arizona.
[00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:45.111]  All right, go ahead and fade it down.
[00:41:45.131 --> 00:41:48.812]  Look, the full thing, it gets even more insane, is at InfoWars.com.
[00:41:48.892 --> 00:41:51.793]  So, obviously, we know they stole Arizona.
[00:41:52.013 --> 00:41:52.813]  They stole Michigan.
[00:41:52.833 --> 00:41:53.713]  They stole Georgia.
[00:41:53.733 --> 00:41:54.213]  We caught them.
[00:41:54.473 --> 00:41:56.474]  They indicted the president for saying the truth.
[00:41:57.154 --> 00:41:58.255]  And it just gets more insane.
[00:41:58.435 --> 00:42:02.037]  And the good news is they're being revealed and more stuff like this is coming out.
[00:42:02.197 --> 00:42:07.721]  But you need to go to InfoWars.com and share this with everybody and listen to the full 50 minutes or whatever it is.
[00:42:08.361 --> 00:42:09.482]  It's so slimy.
[00:42:09.762 --> 00:42:11.263]  And I've experienced the exact same thing.
[00:42:11.763 --> 00:42:13.324]  They do this all day long, folks.
[00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:14.645]  This is how they took the country over.
[00:42:15.285 --> 00:42:19.509]  The Second American Revolution is happening now right in front of you.
[00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:24.194]  And you're tuned in to InfoWars because you're either looking for the truth or you're already a patriot.
[00:42:24.655 --> 00:42:32.502]  I'm asking you now to realize we are at the fulcrum, the crossroads, in the fight for human destiny and human future.
[00:42:33.163 --> 00:42:34.884]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[00:42:35.344 --> 00:42:37.365]  Please buy great products at FortWorthStore.com.
[00:42:37.665 --> 00:42:40.606]  And please pray for the transmission.
[00:42:40.886 --> 00:42:42.047]  Without you, we're going to fail.
[00:42:42.487 --> 00:42:53.172]  But if you simply take action and spread the word, and pray for the broadcast, and buy the products, you will continue to aid us together in our victory against these tyrants.
[00:42:53.472 --> 00:42:55.033]  But now is the time to make the decision.
[00:42:55.593 --> 00:43:00.355]  I know there's millions of forms of media out there, and all this BS, and the globalists hope you get lost in all of it.
[00:43:00.735 --> 00:43:05.420]  But notice the globalists, the New World Order, are coming after us because they realize we've got their number.
[00:43:06.281 --> 00:43:06.721]  Think about it.
[00:43:07.082 --> 00:43:08.403]  Infowars is the tip of the spear.
[00:43:08.423 --> 00:43:11.886]  If you want to support the tip of the spear, that decision is up to you.
[00:43:11.967 --> 00:43:13.967]  Please support us now at FullerStorm.
[00:43:14.405 --> 00:43:19.146]   We have been through hell together my friends, but I'm telling you the Great Awakening is here.
[00:43:19.146 --> 00:43:23.826]   All right, great constitutional lawyer, very popular talk show host
[00:43:23.826 --> 00:43:29.846]   Viva Fry joins us on short notice, and I really appreciate him coming on.
[00:43:29.929 --> 00:43:31.971]  We've had a huge victory.
[00:43:32.731 --> 00:43:46.759]  Canada's gotten massive criticism around the world for once being one of the freest, friendliest, nicest places ever, to turning into a WUF, China 2.0, social credit score, police state nightmare.
[00:43:47.799 --> 00:43:50.740]  And the Canadians, obviously, a year into lockdowns, got pissed.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:55.082]  They're going to churches, beating people up, but the liquor stores and topless bars stayed open.
[00:43:55.802 --> 00:44:00.244]  And so the truckers and others peacefully went into the capital, Ottawa, and took it over.
[00:44:00.984 --> 00:44:10.107]  And they grabbed thousands of people's bank accounts without any judicial system and harassed them, threw people in prison, ran over women and children with horses.
[00:44:10.187 --> 00:44:12.688]  And I mean, it was bad.
[00:44:12.908 --> 00:44:24.957]   And then you've got this, this, the deputy head of the WEF, Coming out and again we've got the head of WF saying that Trudeau is the model.
[00:44:26.098 --> 00:44:37.903]  We've got her openly saying that this is a great thing we've done and now since the court has come out and ruled against it.
[00:44:39.537 --> 00:44:41.198]  She is still out there defending it.
[00:44:41.658 --> 00:44:48.421]  A reporter asked Christina Freeland, who literally is like the heir to the dictators of Ukraine during Nazi Germany.
[00:44:48.441 --> 00:44:55.403]  I mean, her grandfather was the head propagandist for three countries, not just Ukraine, but based in Ukraine.
[00:44:55.664 --> 00:44:57.144]  You talk about where the Nazis are.
[00:44:57.164 --> 00:45:03.387]  I mean, this is, it's why they had a full Nazi SS guy that actually took part in real mass grave, mass killing.
[00:45:04.187 --> 00:45:05.148]  They have a standing ovation.
[00:45:05.428 --> 00:45:06.129]  They think we're stupid.
[00:45:06.469 --> 00:45:17.180]  A reporter asked Christina Freeland if she has any regrets on the decision to freeze bank accounts and credit cards after the use of the Emergencies Act was deemed to infringe on charter rights.
[00:45:18.241 --> 00:45:24.106]   We face a country and a government And an incredibly serious threat.
[00:45:24.146 --> 00:45:27.049]  And she goes on to describe the people as the threat.
[00:45:27.069 --> 00:45:30.111]  So we're going to roll the video of her being asked this question.
[00:45:30.532 --> 00:45:33.795]  And again, when she was in college, she was running intelligence operations against Russia.
[00:45:34.035 --> 00:45:41.042]  I've got news articles bragging about her when she was in college and how disruptive she was and everything.
[00:45:41.082 --> 00:45:42.023]  I mean, this is a spy.
[00:45:42.523 --> 00:45:43.884]  This is an operative, okay?
[00:45:44.707 --> 00:45:46.589]  I mean, this is what she does, all right?
[00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:51.676]  And so, she's very, very dangerous, but I don't want to just stay focused on her.
[00:45:51.696 --> 00:45:58.124]  It's all about, really, Trudeau and a repudiation of, we penetrate the cabinets, globalist takeover of our governments.
[00:45:59.431 --> 00:46:03.793]  When Schwab is asked, Canada, as well as New Zealand, he said, was the model.
[00:46:04.213 --> 00:46:10.696]  Well, we've already seen Jacinda Ardern's repudiated and now made the UNWEF head of global censorship.
[00:46:11.356 --> 00:46:12.797]  I mean, talk about villains.
[00:46:13.677 --> 00:46:20.020]  So, here's a short clip of her yesterday, then we overlaid it with some of the abuses, and then we'll go to Viva Fra.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:20.320]  Here it is.
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:29.246]  Your decision seems to single out some of your choices on freezing bank accounts and credit cards as being part of the reason where it's unreasonable in terms of the measures taken by the government.
[00:46:29.626 --> 00:46:31.547]  You defended those when you announced them at the time.
[00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:35.090]  Do you have any regrets on taking that measure in the light of this decision?
[00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:39.053]  Would you have done it differently based on what we've seen from the federal court today?
[00:46:41.434 --> 00:46:52.584]   As I said in my opening remarks, We faced, as a country and as a government, an incredibly serious threat.
[00:46:53.464 --> 00:47:02.528]  A threat to the public safety of many Canadians, a threat to our national security, including our national economic security.
[00:47:04.469 --> 00:47:14.754]  We acted to secure and protect Canada and to secure and protect the national interest.
[00:47:16.405 --> 00:47:18.426]  It was not an easy time.
[00:47:18.446 --> 00:47:22.229]  These were not easy decisions.
[00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:48.057]   In making our decisions and choosing to act, we worked very, very hard with all levels of government, and we were very mindful of acting in such a way that The safety, the physical safety of all Canadians involved would be preserved.
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:57.145]  I don't want to minimize the gravity of the actions we took.
[00:47:58.886 --> 00:48:05.132]  Neither do I want to minimize the gravity of the threat Canada faced.
[00:48:05.492 --> 00:48:17.237]   And to your question, I was certain after a lot of deliberation with colleagues and many others that we took the right decision.
[00:48:17.317 --> 00:48:18.399]  I was certain at the time.
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:22.723]  I was certain when I testified before Rouleau.
[00:48:23.564 --> 00:48:25.306]  And I remain certain today.
[00:48:25.386 --> 00:48:25.667]  Thank you.
[00:48:27.247 --> 00:48:33.891]  Tyrants have an instinct to dominate and control people, but it almost always backfires if you're in a society that ever had freedom.
[00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:40.194]  If you're like in North Korea that ever had freedom for thousands of years in that culture, then you can get away with it.
[00:48:40.755 --> 00:48:44.417]  But if there's ever been a history of it, or people have had some freedom, it doesn't work.
[00:48:45.097 --> 00:48:46.018]  And I think about Waco.
[00:48:46.058 --> 00:48:47.841]  Yeah, the Davidians were weird, had some issues.
[00:48:47.861 --> 00:48:49.743]  They could have arrested Koresh any day in town.
[00:48:50.023 --> 00:48:51.065]  He had businesses in town.
[00:48:51.105 --> 00:48:52.446]  He jogged every day off the property.
[00:48:53.007 --> 00:48:55.550]  They went and blew it up, burned it down, and thought people loved that.
[00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:57.252]  No, it totally pissed the whole country off.
[00:48:57.633 --> 00:49:03.941]  Well, we just saw something similar to that in Canada, and it's awakened the Canadians and the world.
[00:49:05.043 --> 00:49:05.783]  So this is a big deal.
[00:49:05.823 --> 00:49:18.611]  So we have a lawyer here and a talk show host, Aviva Fry, who can speak to this court ruling, this federal ruling, and what it means, and then really the incalcitrance we're seeing out of Trudeau and out of Freeland, where he thinks this is going.
[00:49:18.651 --> 00:49:20.773]  But hopefully, it looks like the worm's turning.
[00:49:21.273 --> 00:49:29.098]  This is going to lead to removing Trudeau, repudiating these totalitarian policies that they're beta testing for the rest of the world, where she bragged and he bragged.
[00:49:29.338 --> 00:49:30.702]  We're going to use this the whole world.
[00:49:31.003 --> 00:49:31.945]  The left celebrated it.
[00:49:32.226 --> 00:49:34.071]  Now we're taking everybody's bank accounts around the world.
[00:49:34.292 --> 00:49:36.497]  I mean, this is where they want to take us with the central bank digital currencies.
[00:49:38.379 --> 00:49:42.121]  People might not know that I am, in fact, or was a lawyer, sworn in in 2007.
[00:49:42.322 --> 00:49:43.963]  I practiced for like a good 12 years.
[00:49:45.103 --> 00:49:46.684]  I dabbled in constitutional law.
[00:49:47.005 --> 00:49:51.327]  It wasn't my expertise, but that's not to say I don't know what the heck is going on now.
[00:49:52.148 --> 00:49:55.970]  The decision coming out of the federal court is monumental.
[00:49:56.711 --> 00:50:02.515]  And it's to be distinguished from the ruling that came out of the POEC, which was the Public Order Emergency Commission.
[00:50:03.015 --> 00:50:09.318]   After they invoked the Emergencies Act, They were required by law to investigate the circumstances surrounding the invocation.
[00:50:09.758 --> 00:50:11.339]  That was a political process.
[00:50:11.859 --> 00:50:13.100]  This is a legal process.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:23.085]  And the judge in this case distinguished between the Commissioner's ruling in the political process versus the diametric opposite ruling in this legal process.
[00:50:23.445 --> 00:50:24.766]  And so, they had evidence.
[00:50:24.966 --> 00:50:31.469]  They had petitioners arguing that the Emergencies Act was invoked without legal justification.
[00:50:32.222 --> 00:50:40.465]  And you know, after some procedural stuff, two of the four petitioners were denied standing, but two of the four were recognized as having standing, those who had their bank accounts frozen.
[00:50:41.065 --> 00:50:56.991]  And after getting over the issue of mootness, the judge comes to the conclusion that it wasn't reasonable, it wasn't warranted, it wasn't necessary, there wasn't a national infrastructure catastrophe or threat, that there was a blockade in Coutts.
[00:50:57.291 --> 00:50:58.732]  Well, let me interrupt you for a moment.
[00:50:59.052 --> 00:51:00.653]  I'll give you the floor, I'm going to shut up.
[00:51:00.673 --> 00:51:02.273]   But isn't The threat?
[00:51:02.313 --> 00:51:04.694]  The militarized police and horses running over families?
[00:51:04.754 --> 00:51:05.555]  Isn't that the threat?
[00:51:06.675 --> 00:51:10.056]  I mean, look, that'll be the... That's the response.
[00:51:10.116 --> 00:51:11.277]  I mean, it's obvious.
[00:51:11.777 --> 00:51:16.859]  Canada looked more like China, North Korea, or Russia than it did look like Canada for that brief moment in time.
[00:51:17.279 --> 00:51:22.902]  This was a peaceful protest, although the judge came to the conclusion that it went beyond the bounds of a reasonable protest.
[00:51:23.482 --> 00:51:23.722]  Fine.
[00:51:24.346 --> 00:51:26.307]  The issue is to invoke the Emergencies Act.
[00:51:26.347 --> 00:51:29.569]  The Emergencies Act substituted for the War Measures Act.
[00:51:29.889 --> 00:51:37.092]  The War Measures Act, as per its name, is to be invoked during times of war or national crisis.
[00:51:37.392 --> 00:51:46.517]  It was invoked once, I think during World War I, and Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Justin Trudeau's father, invoked it during the FLQ crisis in the late 70s, the Front Libération de Québec.
[00:51:47.037 --> 00:51:51.402]  That was when a group of separatists were actually planting pipe bombs in mailboxes.
[00:51:51.482 --> 00:51:53.484]  One was a mile and a half from my house in Montreal.
[00:51:54.205 --> 00:51:56.307]  They actually kidnapped politicians and killed one.
[00:51:56.607 --> 00:51:59.550]  Pierre Laporte, kidnapped, thrown in the trunk of a car and murdered.
[00:51:59.871 --> 00:52:04.235]   So when Justin Trudeau's daddy invoked The Emergencies Act.
[00:52:04.775 --> 00:52:07.758]  Arguably, it had much more of a justification at the time.
[00:52:08.038 --> 00:52:12.402]  But even then, people were arguing that the daddy went too far with the measures.
[00:52:12.783 --> 00:52:20.850]  Here, you are dealing with a protest occupying, if you even want to call it that, four to six blocks in downtown Ottawa.
[00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:23.733]  Ottawa is the national capital of Canada.
[00:52:24.093 --> 00:52:25.114]  It's a government town.
[00:52:25.334 --> 00:52:28.477]  They were protesting on Wellington Street in front of Parliament.
[00:52:28.917 --> 00:52:29.839]  Was it an inconvenience?
[00:52:29.919 --> 00:52:30.620]  I have no doubt.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.901]  Was the horn honking loud?
[00:52:32.081 --> 00:52:34.084]  Yeah, I was there documenting it for 13 days.
[00:52:34.285 --> 00:52:38.485]   It was not a national emergency warranting invoking the emergency.
[00:52:38.485 --> 00:52:42.765]   The emergency was the public coming together and saying no to the lockdowns and the WFUN
[00:52:42.765 --> 00:52:44.644]  agenda.
[00:52:44.644 --> 00:52:48.204]   The emergency was that we were living under a tyrannical regime for the last two to three
[00:52:48.204 --> 00:52:54.164]   years imposing unscientific, constitutionally abusive vaccine passport mandates, all this
[00:52:54.164 --> 00:52:59.045]   crap on the truckers who are the ones feeding the country literally.
[00:52:59.423 --> 00:53:05.086]  And so they descended onto Ottawa from all corners of Canada, Nova Scotia on the east, Vancouver on the west.
[00:53:05.126 --> 00:53:09.748]  They drove to Ottawa, and it was a three-week, massive, peaceful, beautiful protest.
[00:53:09.988 --> 00:53:17.056]   Justin Trudeau, that filthy coward that he is, Didn't take one second to step out onto the street to talk to the protesters.
[00:53:17.236 --> 00:53:20.237]  He justified it, that you don't negotiate.
[00:53:20.397 --> 00:53:24.678]  I don't attend protests where I don't agree with the subject of the protest.
[00:53:25.038 --> 00:53:25.938]  That's because you're an idiot.
[00:53:26.158 --> 00:53:28.058]  And that's not what leading a country is about.
[00:53:28.178 --> 00:53:30.059]  You don't only represent the people who voted for you.
[00:53:30.179 --> 00:53:31.919]  You don't only listen to the people who voted for you.
[00:53:32.199 --> 00:53:34.400]  So he says, I'm not even going to cross the street to talk to these people.
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:37.441]  I'm going to come down with an iron fist, call him.
[00:53:38.181 --> 00:53:39.021]  Alex, I mean, I was there.
[00:53:39.853 --> 00:53:43.636]  They were detonating concussive grenades on the day they violently broke this up.
[00:53:43.876 --> 00:53:52.802]  They called in, I mean, you won't know what all these names mean, RCMP, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, OPP, the Ontario Provincial Police, Sûreté de Québec, which is the police from Quebec.
[00:53:53.282 --> 00:53:54.383]  They had the York Police.
[00:53:54.723 --> 00:53:59.266]  They called in all of the police, but Justin Trudeau says, don't worry, we're not calling in the military.
[00:53:59.426 --> 00:54:02.248]  No, you're just calling in a highly militarized police force.
[00:54:02.428 --> 00:54:04.049]  They had snipers on building tops.
[00:54:04.629 --> 00:54:12.074]  What do you make of her defending this in that conference we just played yesterday and literally saying there was such a threat, she says, by the people.
[00:54:12.455 --> 00:54:14.176]  I mean, this is like ridiculous.
[00:54:15.116 --> 00:54:19.920]  It's ridiculous, but you notice also she discreetly threw in this unknown concept of economic threat.
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.942]  That's not a criteria for invoking the Emergencies Act.
[00:54:23.122 --> 00:54:25.603]  These people are scoundrels of the highest order.
[00:54:25.623 --> 00:54:30.847]  Plus, they were protesting the blockade, the siege of the lockdowns, which was the economic threat we know.
[00:54:31.584 --> 00:54:34.286]  Well, that's the ultimate hypocrisy irony in all of this.
[00:54:34.566 --> 00:54:39.210]  They say that three weeks of occupying downtown Ottawa caused economic interruptions.
[00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:41.452]  They had shut down the country for two years.
[00:54:41.852 --> 00:54:48.798]  And by the way, they shut down Ottawa for months after the protest was over, setting up their blockades, crippling the infrastructure there.
[00:54:49.078 --> 00:54:50.279]  They are scoundrels of the highest order.
[00:54:50.299 --> 00:54:51.260]  There's no other way to say it.
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:53.622]  Christa Freeland is a loathsome human being.
[00:54:54.022 --> 00:54:57.465]  And it's arguable who is more detestable between her and Justin Trudeau.
[00:54:57.585 --> 00:54:58.946]  So where does this go now?
[00:54:58.986 --> 00:55:04.430]  Because obviously they admitted it was a beta test for the world, the grabbing of the bank accounts, they admitted that, it was celebrated.
[00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:06.171]  It's now backfired on them.
[00:55:07.111 --> 00:55:10.314]  What comes next for Trudeau and the other W.E.F.
[00:55:10.754 --> 00:55:11.214]  stooges?
[00:55:12.115 --> 00:55:16.658]  And just so everybody knows also, Christia Freeland is on the board of trustees of the W.E.F.
[00:55:16.698 --> 00:55:21.521]  She's not, she's a, I forget what her position is in Canada, but she's like the second most position, second most powerful person to Trudeau.
[00:55:21.862 --> 00:55:24.163]  She's on the board of trustees of the W.E.F.
[00:55:24.343 --> 00:55:25.904]  You tell me how that's not a conflict of interest.
[00:55:26.204 --> 00:55:26.845]  Set that aside.
[00:55:27.398 --> 00:55:29.101]  Where does it go from here to appeal?
[00:55:29.521 --> 00:55:36.471]  And my concern is having read the judgment, it's 190 pages, but you can sort of filter through the stuff that's not necessary.
[00:55:37.072 --> 00:55:40.557]  They're going to take it to appeal and it's going to get politicized.
[00:55:40.858 --> 00:55:47.543]   And there's a risk that they're going to end up with a court of appeal that says, look, You know, we have to show deference to the lower court when it comes to findings of fact.
[00:55:47.923 --> 00:55:50.223]  But in this particular case, we agree on the findings of fact.
[00:55:50.283 --> 00:55:55.404]  It's a question of the finding of law, whether or not it met the criteria to warrant invoking the act.
[00:55:55.584 --> 00:55:57.305]  My concern is this gets overturned on appeal.
[00:55:57.665 --> 00:55:59.285]  And so this white pill turns into a black pill.
[00:55:59.305 --> 00:56:01.246]  But for the time being, it's a white pill.
[00:56:01.486 --> 00:56:07.727]  For the time being now, you got Elon Musk on Twitter tweeting about the coups for the men who have been arrested.
[00:56:07.867 --> 00:56:14.227]   on conspiracy to commit homicide, the most politically trumped up bull crap charges imaginable,
[00:56:14.227 --> 00:56:17.867]   necessary because that was the lynch pin for invoking the Emergencies Act.
[00:56:17.867 --> 00:56:22.747]   They said, look at this, in Cootes, Alberta, we have men plotting to kill RCMP officers,
[00:56:22.747 --> 00:56:23.906]  it's a national security.
[00:56:23.906 --> 00:56:29.706]   The charges, in my humble view, are the utmost of rubbish, and they needed to be issued so
[00:56:29.706 --> 00:56:32.847]   that Commissioner Hulot could come to his political finding that this was necessary
[00:56:32.847 --> 00:56:35.906]  under the circumstances because of the grave risk.
[00:56:35.952 --> 00:56:46.022]  The awareness that this is getting right now is monumental and the pressure needs to be kept up because this could be, you know, the first domino in what needs to be the downfall of Justin Trudeau.
[00:56:46.202 --> 00:56:51.748]  By all accounts, apparently, if I trust the polls, which I don't, if they call an election today, the conservatives will win a majority.
[00:56:52.088 --> 00:56:57.688]   The bottom line, they set an absolute terrible precedent by invoking the Emergencies Act
[00:56:57.688 --> 00:57:01.527]   and the courts need to intervene if anyone's going to have any confidence in the political
[00:57:01.527 --> 00:57:11.447]   institutions of Canada and the financial institutions of Canada.
[00:57:11.716 --> 00:57:13.936]  He just called up Trudeau yesterday.
[00:57:13.956 --> 00:57:15.277]  In fact, guys, cue that up.
[00:57:15.297 --> 00:57:16.697]  I forgot to put that on today's list.
[00:57:16.758 --> 00:57:17.518]  I never got to it yesterday.
[00:57:17.858 --> 00:57:19.218]  And said, hey, I'm coming to free Canada.
[00:57:19.599 --> 00:57:24.860]  I mean, Canada is a beautiful, super rich, incredible resources, basically as much resources the U.S.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.261]  has, one of the richest countries in the world.
[00:57:26.941 --> 00:57:29.402]  And we need to keep it free here.
[00:57:29.922 --> 00:57:31.183]  And so it's very exciting.
[00:57:31.903 --> 00:57:46.601]  To see it, major UFC events, the fighters calling out Trudeau and Europe calling him out and people really recognizing that this run that they're making against Canada, that Klaus Schwab admits is a beta test for the world.
[00:57:46.621 --> 00:57:47.602]  I have listeners all the time.
[00:57:48.601 --> 00:57:49.742]  Most of them get it, but some don't.
[00:57:49.802 --> 00:57:51.842]  Say, why do you care about Australia being a tyranny?
[00:57:52.463 --> 00:57:54.264]  Or why do you care about Canada becoming a tyranny?
[00:57:55.024 --> 00:58:00.947]  Well, because it's the same globalist forces that they admit are testing all this, and it's the exact same program.
[00:58:00.987 --> 00:58:17.079]   So, speak to, with your knowledge on this, why you think they picked Canada, and The larger agenda of why they want to get us used to martial law, and now King Charles is saying we want to lock you down most of the time to save the earth.
[00:58:17.099 --> 00:58:21.542]  I mean, they're really trying to train everybody to have this post-industrial, locked-in-your-house world.
[00:58:21.762 --> 00:58:23.283]  It's fabulously corrupt.
[00:58:23.603 --> 00:58:25.544]  They're talking about banning coffee, rice.
[00:58:26.024 --> 00:58:27.666]  Cut trees down, they're bad for the earth.
[00:58:27.746 --> 00:58:32.090]  I mean, they've got the most whacked out policies and they're selling dystopia.
[00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:33.692]  You will eat the bugs like it's a good thing.
[00:58:34.093 --> 00:58:36.415]  And of course, this last week they had the Davos Group.
[00:58:36.435 --> 00:58:38.117]  They admitted, oh, we want trust back.
[00:58:38.197 --> 00:58:39.018]  Everybody hates us.
[00:58:39.258 --> 00:58:41.460]  They got called out to their face by a bunch of world leaders.
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:45.985]  So do they understand that the world is now waking up to they are the villains?
[00:58:46.285 --> 00:58:48.548]  They are the James Bond, you know, villains?
[00:58:49.369 --> 00:58:55.933]  Well, Alex, I mean, yeah, they say they want trust back and the way that they're going to get trust back is by censoring disinformation and misinformation online.
[00:58:56.393 --> 00:59:00.576]  You know, if you ask why would they pick Australia, why would they pick Canada as the testing grounds?
[00:59:00.956 --> 00:59:03.177]  The obvious answer, I mean, it's the reflexive one.
[00:59:04.098 --> 00:59:13.924]  No, no right to self-defense, you know, not densely populated and polite cultures, polite, docile, subservient, subservient in the parliamentary sense.
[00:59:14.631 --> 00:59:16.052]  We are subjects of the government.
[00:59:16.092 --> 00:59:18.894]  We are not, you know, free citizens with God-given rights.
[00:59:19.135 --> 00:59:24.459]  So it makes sense as to why this would be tested on peaceful, unarmed, docile, subservient cultures.
[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:31.465]  But as far as the risks go, I mean, pay more attention to Canada than to Australia because Canada shares a border with America.
[00:59:31.685 --> 00:59:39.451]  When you have Chinese soldiers being trained for wintertime military, you know, combat conditions in Canada, that's a direct threat to the US.
[00:59:39.751 --> 00:59:44.214]   When you have, culturally speaking, this I call it communism for lack of a better word.
[00:59:44.314 --> 00:59:45.975]  Fascism, tyranny, whatever you want to call it.
[00:59:46.696 --> 00:59:48.237]  Trudeau endorsed.
[00:59:48.737 --> 00:59:51.759]  He said his favorite thing is Chinese communist dictatorship.
[00:59:52.703 --> 00:59:56.948]  He has a great admiration for the basic dictatorship of China because they can turn their economy around on a dime.
[00:59:57.188 --> 00:59:58.129]  He didn't say this part.
[00:59:58.169 --> 00:59:59.130]  This is the fill in the blank.
[00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:01.152]  They can lock their population down on a dime.
[01:00:01.372 --> 01:00:08.079]  They can do whatever the hell they want to the population because they don't have the means to defend themselves, to protest, because protest has been criminalized.
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:09.700]  People don't know this.
[01:00:10.181 --> 01:00:19.866]   In Nova Scotia, during the heat of the lockdowns, a Nova Scotia court Issued an injunction to prevent, prohibit outdoor protest against COVID measures.
[01:00:20.286 --> 01:00:27.467]  I mean, when you do not have any rights in the country, it becomes just the easiest thing to dominate, to conquer.
[01:00:28.307 --> 01:00:33.128]  But this decision, it's amazing, it's fantastic, and we'll see if it gets overturned.
[01:00:33.148 --> 01:00:46.572]   But for the time being, it's putting on blast what's going on in Canada, and it's putting on blast, yes, what is a very nefarious, seemingly global push To have people agree to give up their freedom.
[01:00:46.692 --> 01:00:56.639]  Sure, what do you make of the massive, I got the articles right here, Politico, New York Times, you name it, the globalists are losing, they're in panic mode, everyone hates them, they don't know what to do.
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:59.460]  Keeps rattling the globalists.
[01:01:00.041 --> 01:01:01.781]  Elites have no idea what to do.
[01:01:01.841 --> 01:01:02.341]  Politico.
[01:01:02.741 --> 01:01:10.144]  So this is a pretty powerful moment here where they wanted to operate like masters of the universe with us little plebs down here not even looking at them.
[01:01:10.404 --> 01:01:11.884]  They're really being spotlighted right now.
[01:01:12.284 --> 01:01:14.145]  Can you speak to that and what are you expecting to do next?
[01:01:15.907 --> 01:01:21.992]  I don't want to think the doom pill thoughts, but yeah, watching the highlights, and I was following the Davos meeting.
[01:01:23.494 --> 01:01:24.154]  The gig is up.
[01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:29.018]  You recall at one point in time, this idea of secret meetings in Davos was a conspiracy theory.
[01:01:29.378 --> 01:01:32.161]  Then it becomes known fact, and they say, okay, sure, they're meeting there.
[01:01:32.481 --> 01:01:40.087]  And then the great reset, conspiracy theory, until you actually see the printouts, and it's an actual policy that they're pushing behind their closed door meetings in Davos.
[01:01:40.547 --> 01:01:49.772]   And now, You know, it's gained public awareness, public attention, where people are actually watching it and sharing it, not because they like the ideas, but to expose the villainy.
[01:01:50.012 --> 01:01:54.435]  And so I don't know who that European woman was who's talking about disinformation and misinformation.
[01:01:54.915 --> 01:02:02.459]  It's what they need to do right now in order to control the narrative, to prevent people from calling them out and amplifying and putting them on blast.
[01:02:02.799 --> 01:02:03.339]  But they know it.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:04.440]  And the gig is up.
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:05.180]  That's exactly right.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:10.123]  You have the Queen of the Netherlands saying we need a world government and a world cashless society to make you take your shots.
[01:02:10.823 --> 01:02:13.606]  They're all up there saying, we gotta censor people so they trust us again.
[01:02:13.626 --> 01:02:18.250]  That's not how you get trust, is putting a gag on somebody.
[01:02:18.854 --> 01:02:25.416]  No, and now you got Trump coming out with Vivek, his influence, saying we're never going to have a CBDC in America.
[01:02:26.817 --> 01:02:27.397]  He's on to it.
[01:02:27.617 --> 01:02:28.277]  He understands it.
[01:02:28.297 --> 01:02:32.478]  He understood it in 2016, which is why, in retrospect, Kierkegaard's expression is beautiful.
[01:02:32.518 --> 01:02:34.839]  Life can only be understood backwards, but needs to be lived forwards.
[01:02:35.259 --> 01:02:40.781]  Now you understand why in 2016 he was public enemy number one once he became the candidate, and why he's public enemy number one now.
[01:02:41.961 --> 01:02:43.982]  The gig, or the jig, I forget what the expression is, it's up!
[01:02:44.502 --> 01:02:49.003]  Everybody knows it, and even the people who were reluctant to admit it, are now recognizing it.
[01:02:49.023 --> 01:02:49.963]  So that's my next question.
[01:02:50.023 --> 01:03:05.207]  Clearly they admit, and Debo's group, Club of Rome, CFR, Carnegie Endowment that runs the CIA currently, they admit they were going to use Disease X, which was the last attack they called it, the new attack's called Disease X, it's just a placeholder for people to keep asking what it is.
[01:03:05.567 --> 01:03:09.748]  It's just the next boogeyman, whether real or semi-real or not real.
[01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:14.913]  They did their big dry run for control, and it blew up in their face.
[01:03:14.953 --> 01:03:18.355]  They got compliance for a while, but it built a blowback much bigger than they thought.
[01:03:18.375 --> 01:03:23.799]  So I think it's fair to say this test failed, but now Tedros and others are saying, well, the new virus is coming.
[01:03:24.059 --> 01:03:25.901]  It looks to me like they're gonna try it again.
[01:03:26.661 --> 01:03:27.142]  What do you think?
[01:03:29.783 --> 01:03:36.068]  I know that you've been right often enough that the Alex Jones was right meme is a meme for a reason.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.306]  I mean, obviously, desperate times call for desperate measures, and these are definitely desperate times for these people.
[01:03:42.807 --> 01:03:46.771]  And they are, if not a rabid animal, they are a cornered animal.
[01:03:47.152 --> 01:03:48.513]  So, I mean, who knows?
[01:03:48.694 --> 01:03:50.716]  They've done terrible things throughout history.
[01:03:50.896 --> 01:03:52.678]  Would I think it's going to be any different in the upcoming year?
[01:03:52.959 --> 01:03:53.039]  No.
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:04:00.526]  The democratization of information and the free flow of information is the weapon, for lack of a better word.
[01:04:00.586 --> 01:04:14.260]  And it's no surprise why, in Canada, you got the government trying to nationalize the internet, effectively, trying to censor the internet, trying to suppress what people can see, learn, and view on the internet through their link tax, through their online streaming act.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:22.665]  So, the overt attack is going to be on public discourse, and they're going to cloak it in benevolence as to fighting disinformation and misinformation.
[01:04:23.426 --> 01:04:30.350]  But I think the awakening has created something potentially of an insurmountable shift in momentum.
[01:04:30.790 --> 01:04:32.911]  Perfectly said!
[01:04:32.951 --> 01:04:34.252]  I've been looking for the word for weeks.
[01:04:34.592 --> 01:04:36.634]  There's been an insurmountable shift in momentum.
[01:04:36.794 --> 01:04:37.174]  Wow!
[01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:38.575]  Keep going.
[01:04:39.689 --> 01:04:41.290]  No, actually, I like that too.
[01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:42.591]  I'm going to quote myself.
[01:04:43.431 --> 01:04:46.753]  And so, you know, they might try to burn the whole building down.
[01:04:47.453 --> 01:04:50.555]  Or you might actually start getting people who are politicians nonetheless.
[01:04:51.135 --> 01:04:53.777]  Politicians, we call them political whores for a reason.
[01:04:54.217 --> 01:04:56.278]  And that can be used to the benefit of the people.
[01:04:56.438 --> 01:04:57.119]  Exactly!
[01:04:57.139 --> 01:04:59.480]  When they see we're winning, they're all going to flip to us.
[01:05:00.367 --> 01:05:02.349]  They're going to say, oh yeah, free speech is cool again.
[01:05:02.489 --> 01:05:03.911]  Oh yeah, freedom of movement is cool again.
[01:05:04.011 --> 01:05:06.774]  Oh yeah, we shouldn't violate your constitutional rights.
[01:05:06.914 --> 01:05:09.397]  There wasn't a virus provision of the Constitution.
[01:05:09.597 --> 01:05:16.244]  So when it becomes politically expedient, they'll jump ship or turn ship just as quickly, the political whores.
[01:05:16.284 --> 01:05:20.269]  The ones who have been true the whole time will be leading the way, like the Thomas Massys of the world.
[01:05:20.509 --> 01:05:22.271]  Like the Donald Trumps of the world.
[01:05:23.091 --> 01:05:26.835]  But the other ones, there's ones in between who are susceptible to public opinion.
[01:05:27.135 --> 01:05:31.699]  And so once that starts shifting, and once that starts moving quickly, they'll move quickly, they'll turn face too.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:38.966]  And then it's only gonna be like the Hillary Clintons, the George Soroses, who are gonna be sitting there saying, hey, don't leave me alone here, guys, I don't like the mobbing.
[01:05:38.986 --> 01:05:40.467]  Exactly, they're like Hitler and the bugger.
[01:05:40.487 --> 01:05:44.391]  Did you see Alexander Soros, who now heads up that operation, admitting they're losing?
[01:05:44.831 --> 01:05:45.992]  And then like, gibbering?
[01:05:47.394 --> 01:05:54.003]  That, I feel bad making fun of him for that because I don't, you know, it was so bad it's like he had an aneurysm of sorts.
[01:05:54.804 --> 01:05:58.910]  But, and I also saw his tweet from yesterday and I'm still debating whether or not that tweet was an overt call.
[01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:00.352]  Oh, it's definitely a bullet hole and $47.
[01:06:01.954 --> 01:06:04.315]  I did a bit of a deep dive.
[01:06:04.355 --> 01:06:11.059]  That image has been around for 10 years, but they definitely selected that image on purpose because to show inflation, there were better, more appropriate images.
[01:06:11.659 --> 01:06:15.061]  But no, the bottom line, the guys, you know, George Soros is smart and evil.
[01:06:15.481 --> 01:06:17.002]  Alex Soros is dumb and evil.
[01:06:17.542 --> 01:06:18.262]  And that's what's going to happen.
[01:06:18.282 --> 01:06:20.283]  I say it's rice patty to rice patty in three generations.
[01:06:20.584 --> 01:06:25.326]  And the evil forces that be, they're going to be in the rice patties because they're losing it and everybody's seeing it.
[01:06:25.706 --> 01:06:27.828]  Wow, people can hear your amazing show.
[01:06:27.868 --> 01:06:37.616]  They can find you on X. They can just type in Viva Frye, F-R-E-I, the Viva Frye on X. Thank you so much.
[01:06:37.676 --> 01:06:39.378]  VivaBarnesLaw.Locals.com.
[01:06:39.678 --> 01:06:40.158]  Great job.
[01:06:40.219 --> 01:06:41.500]  Thank you so much, and God bless you.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:42.861]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:06:42.921 --> 01:06:43.161]  Anytime.
[01:06:43.181 --> 01:06:49.266]  The funny thing is I was in my car shooting my car vlog, summarizing that decision, so I'm going to go back to editing that, but anytime.
[01:06:49.306 --> 01:06:49.947]  Thank you for having me.
[01:06:50.267 --> 01:06:50.667]  Thank you.
[01:06:50.747 --> 01:06:51.148]  There he goes.
[01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:52.910]  Alright, we're going to start the next hour.
[01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:56.071]  I've got a bunch of news to hit ahead of Dr. Richard Bartlett joining us.
[01:06:56.751 --> 01:07:02.993]  The governor and others came out in Colorado and attacked us for exposing the Ebola vaccine and the fact that it's a live vaccine that sheds.
[01:07:03.113 --> 01:07:05.174]  They admit it sheds, but they say it's fine, don't worry about it.
[01:07:05.194 --> 01:07:06.614]  We're going to be talking about that too.
[01:07:06.654 --> 01:07:07.274]  Come on, stay with us.
[01:07:08.215 --> 01:07:09.635]  Many botanists died.
[01:07:10.848 --> 01:07:11.929]  Bring us this information.
[01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:16.672]  You can see here the Great Awakening orbiting the Great Reset.
[01:07:17.392 --> 01:07:27.118]  Although the depopulation systems of the Great Reset are not yet fully operational, the Great Reset does have a strong conspiracy network.
[01:07:27.578 --> 01:07:33.482]  It is protected by a satanic shield, which can be disabled by the Great Awakening.
[01:07:33.882 --> 01:07:40.086]  The Great Reset must be deactivated if any victory for humanity is to be accomplished.
[01:07:41.118 --> 01:07:55.172]  Once the Great Awakening deactivates the shield, InfoWars.com forward slash show will cover the truth while Info Warriors fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the Great Reset.
[01:07:55.672 --> 01:07:59.396]  Alex Jones has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.
[01:07:59.756 --> 01:08:05.181]  Get a signed copy of the Great Awakening today at InfoWarsStore.com!
[01:08:08.052 --> 01:08:12.100]  You know, I never imagined being 50 years old, I'll be 15 early next month.
[01:08:13.483 --> 01:08:17.150]  And I never imagined being on air 30 years in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:08:18.682 --> 01:08:18.922]  30 years.
[01:08:18.962 --> 01:08:20.923]  They're finally finding videos from 1994-95.
[01:08:21.003 --> 01:08:24.685]  People are like, you were on in 94-95?
[01:08:24.825 --> 01:08:25.165]  Yeah.
[01:08:26.025 --> 01:08:27.766]  Didn't save it.
[01:08:28.666 --> 01:08:30.047]  The VHS tapes rotted away.
[01:08:30.067 --> 01:08:33.728]  It's just an epic time to be alive.
[01:08:34.608 --> 01:08:37.129]  This is a short segment in a no man's land.
[01:08:37.169 --> 01:08:38.150]  Some stations don't care.
[01:08:38.190 --> 01:08:39.730]  A lot of them do.
[01:08:41.551 --> 01:08:45.873]  I'm going to come back next segment and hit all this other huge news that's unfolding.
[01:08:46.273 --> 01:08:50.494]  Texas National Guard puts up more razor wire after the feds ordered to take it down.
[01:08:50.514 --> 01:08:51.935]  That's what the Democrats always do.
[01:08:51.955 --> 01:08:52.855]  They always ignore the courts.
[01:08:53.375 --> 01:08:55.256]  So this is this is getting into a real crisis.
[01:08:55.276 --> 01:08:56.256]  We're going to be getting to that.
[01:08:57.256 --> 01:09:01.278]  We've got mainstream news saying ban family gardens.
[01:09:02.438 --> 01:09:03.739]  You can't make it up, man.
[01:09:03.759 --> 01:09:05.659]  I mean, these people are evil as hell.
[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:07.480]  So we're going to be hitting all that.
[01:09:09.161 --> 01:09:09.981]  But I saw a video.
[01:09:11.286 --> 01:09:11.847]  On Monday.
[01:09:11.867 --> 01:09:12.628]  Now it's Wednesday.
[01:09:12.668 --> 01:09:13.409]  I never got to it.
[01:09:13.809 --> 01:09:17.994]  So it's going back through the 50, 60 videos that we had in the last few days.
[01:09:18.675 --> 01:09:22.579]  And I saw this particular video of a man confronts drag queen.
[01:09:22.619 --> 01:09:23.340]  It's not a drag queen.
[01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:28.266]  It's a fat dude dressed like a clown at a school and calls him out.
[01:09:29.841 --> 01:09:32.502]  And this is really what we're going to have to do to protect our children.
[01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:39.586]  In many cases, this is going on in public schools, elementary students, and in preschools, without telling the parents.
[01:09:40.546 --> 01:09:50.391]  So I wanted to get to this clip, so I'm going to play it here in a moment, and then we're going to go through a lot of news in the next 30 minutes, and then Dr. Bartlett is pissed.
[01:09:51.648 --> 01:10:00.153]  Because even, I didn't even know this, even mainstream media said experimental Ebola shots that can shed are dangerous.
[01:10:00.673 --> 01:10:01.834]  Even USA Today did.
[01:10:01.894 --> 01:10:02.534]  I didn't know this.
[01:10:03.895 --> 01:10:09.998]  So they're trying to say we're kooks for saying this is an issue, and even mainline people are saying that.
[01:10:10.038 --> 01:10:17.142]  So the government's responded in Colorado, and it is going on a few other places, but Colorado announced it.
[01:10:17.972 --> 01:10:23.095]  And the governor's defense was, oh well, other people are doing it.
[01:10:23.335 --> 01:10:23.795]  Okay?
[01:10:24.315 --> 01:10:25.656]  Other people are taking fentanyl too.
[01:10:26.056 --> 01:10:27.277]  Other people are jumping off cliffs.
[01:10:27.297 --> 01:10:28.197]  Doesn't mean we should all do it.
[01:10:29.078 --> 01:10:33.640]  So here's the pervert time being exposed.
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:34.341]  We'll be right back.
[01:10:35.201 --> 01:10:36.121]  So who brought the tranny?
[01:10:39.363 --> 01:10:40.324]  Who brought the pedophile?
[01:10:40.344 --> 01:10:43.865]  No thank you.
[01:10:43.885 --> 01:10:44.606]  Who brought the pedophile?
[01:10:45.649 --> 01:10:46.190]  We want to know.
[01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:47.992]  You're required to wear a mask.
[01:10:48.012 --> 01:10:48.753]  We want to know.
[01:10:48.773 --> 01:10:49.493]  We'll make the exam.
[01:10:49.513 --> 01:10:49.994]  Thank you, though.
[01:10:52.777 --> 01:10:53.698]  Who brought the pedophile?
[01:10:53.718 --> 01:10:54.839]  I just want to know.
[01:10:54.859 --> 01:10:57.362]  Sorry, that is actually for children.
[01:10:57.442 --> 01:10:58.884]  Well, then why is the pedophile here?
[01:11:00.191 --> 01:11:00.932]  No, no, no.
[01:11:00.972 --> 01:11:02.713]  We want to know why there's a pedophile here.
[01:11:03.013 --> 01:11:04.654]  We saw videos of what that thing does.
[01:11:04.674 --> 01:11:07.796]  I'm sorry, we're not using library policy, so we're not going to ask you.
[01:11:07.836 --> 01:11:09.838]  Hey, you see a lot of pedophiles in here.
[01:11:10.078 --> 01:11:12.540]  It's not what it wants to do to little children.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.460]  Why do you allow a pedophile?
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:14.621]  Why did you bring the pedophile?
[01:11:15.302 --> 01:11:15.942]  I don't understand.
[01:11:16.062 --> 01:11:17.083]  I don't understand.
[01:11:17.223 --> 01:11:17.883]  It's for children.
[01:11:17.903 --> 01:11:19.725]  Then why would you bring children to a pedophile?
[01:11:19.765 --> 01:11:20.385]  It's not her.
[01:11:20.405 --> 01:11:21.726]  It's not vulgar, right?
[01:11:21.746 --> 01:11:23.247]  Hey, you should be ashamed of yourself.
[01:11:24.788 --> 01:11:25.849]  You should be ashamed of yourself.
[01:11:27.006 --> 01:11:28.748]  Why would you want to bring children to this?
[01:11:28.948 --> 01:11:30.810]  Why would you want to expose your children to this?
[01:11:30.850 --> 01:11:32.171]  Just to prove how stupid you are?
[01:11:32.211 --> 01:11:32.932]  A pedophile?
[01:11:32.972 --> 01:11:34.734]  To prove how tolerant?
[01:11:35.054 --> 01:11:39.659]  You want to expose your children to pedophiles to prove how tolerant you are?
[01:11:39.699 --> 01:11:40.339]  This is disgusting.
[01:11:40.359 --> 01:11:41.140]  That thing has videos.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.819]  Yeah, but we got, this is sick. That thing has videos.
[01:11:43.819 --> 01:11:49.509]   Well, well, well, it's real good. It's real good. I'll show you away from the children. >> We got a pedophile here.
[01:11:49.509 --> 01:11:51.500]  We're in giant, oh, I'll never.
[01:11:51.571 --> 01:11:52.311]  What is wrong with you?
[01:11:52.131 --> 01:11:57.131]  Look at this, they brought kids here.
[01:11:57.131 --> 01:11:59.131]  What is wrong with you people?
[01:11:59.131 --> 01:12:00.131]  What is wrong with you?
[01:12:00.131 --> 01:12:01.131]  What is wrong with you?
[01:12:01.131 --> 01:12:02.131]  Tell me, what is wrong with you?
[01:12:02.131 --> 01:12:03.131]  What is wrong with you?
[01:12:03.131 --> 01:12:04.131]  This is sick.
[01:12:04.131 --> 01:12:05.131]  This is sick.
[01:12:05.131 --> 01:12:06.131]  You guys should be the sex, call them.
[01:12:06.131 --> 01:12:07.131]  There's a pedophile here with children.
[01:12:07.131 --> 01:12:08.131]  Yes.
[01:12:08.131 --> 01:12:09.131]  Call them.
[01:12:09.131 --> 01:12:10.131]  I'm not a pedophile.
[01:12:10.131 --> 01:12:11.131]  I'm not a pedophile.
[01:12:11.131 --> 01:12:12.131]  I'm not a pedophile.
[01:12:12.592 --> 01:12:12.972]  Call him!
[01:12:13.433 --> 01:12:14.453]  This is disgusting!
[01:12:14.794 --> 01:12:17.296]  What the hell is wrong with you people?
[01:12:17.316 --> 01:12:18.196]  These poor children!
[01:12:18.216 --> 01:12:20.078]  What is wrong with you sick people?
[01:12:20.738 --> 01:12:22.039]  Get out of here, you pedophile!
[01:12:22.259 --> 01:12:22.880]  Get out of here!
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:24.361]  You're not safe here!
[01:12:24.621 --> 01:12:27.283]  Get out of here!
[01:12:27.303 --> 01:12:28.444]  Look, this is sick!
[01:12:29.044 --> 01:12:29.885]  You are sick!
[01:12:30.205 --> 01:12:31.086]  You are sick!
[01:12:31.126 --> 01:12:32.227]  Look at these poor children!
[01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:33.428]  These poor children!
[01:12:35.449 --> 01:12:36.529]  These poor children!
[01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:38.310]  How dare you guys!
[01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:39.710]  Yeah, this is how you do it, folks.
[01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:41.531]  You guys are sick!
[01:12:41.551 --> 01:12:47.853]  They're trying to demoralize you, they're trying to break your will, and you've got to never let them break your will.
[01:12:48.053 --> 01:12:50.214]  You know, when you push back, you get stronger, they get weaker.
[01:12:50.494 --> 01:12:51.654]  When you give in, you get weaker.
[01:12:52.154 --> 01:12:52.975]  Never surrender.
[01:12:53.335 --> 01:12:56.456]  You know, a lot of people ask, is it Alex Jones posting on X?
[01:12:56.656 --> 01:13:01.857]  And yeah, about 80% of it is, but the crew puts out live links or breaking reports on real Alex Jones.
[01:13:02.337 --> 01:13:27.687]   But I'm so busy, That I was just during a little one minute break rejoining a lot of stations and I thought, I need to post on X at Real Alex Jones right now that Dr. Richard Bartlett, former head of the Governor Medical Task Force, hospital head, you name it, came on Friday and warned about experimental Ebola vaccine that is live, that does shed a weakened form of the virus that can make people with lowered immune systems really sick or kill them.
[01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:30.248]  And we showed a lot of news articles admitting it.
[01:13:31.112 --> 01:13:36.121]  And they had the governor come out against us and all this news and say we're liars and all this.
[01:13:36.602 --> 01:13:40.949]  So Bartlett got upset, which he should, and sent me a bunch of stuff I didn't even have.
[01:13:40.989 --> 01:13:41.470]  I mean, look at this.
[01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:46.572]  CDC finds lapses in latest lab mishap with Ebola virus.
[01:13:47.432 --> 01:13:48.432]  That's Colorado, folks.
[01:13:48.472 --> 01:13:49.673]  That's USA Today.
[01:13:50.733 --> 01:13:51.433]  CDC chief.
[01:13:51.533 --> 01:13:53.233]  Anthrax gaffe should never have happened.
[01:13:53.553 --> 01:13:56.054]  Colorado lab developing Ebola vaccine for military use.
[01:13:56.534 --> 01:13:57.494]  Which is what we say.
[01:13:57.754 --> 01:14:02.155]  They turn it around and say, oh, Jones attacked a hospital and said they're developing all this.
[01:14:02.255 --> 01:14:02.455]  No.
[01:14:02.775 --> 01:14:04.756]  I said they tested it on the damn hospital staff.
[01:14:05.436 --> 01:14:14.465]  So when we show you this newscast coming up, they do their, you know, three second clips of me to then misrepresent what I've said to then set us up.
[01:14:14.545 --> 01:14:25.633]   And I can see they're doing it because we're going up against the Pentagon, the globalists run it, the same ones that created the All these different scares and the ones behind the COVID shot.
[01:14:26.074 --> 01:14:30.315]  Our military are good men and women, but the military at the top is run by a bunch of globalists.
[01:14:30.335 --> 01:14:33.116]  So Rob, you've got access to my ex-account.
[01:14:33.136 --> 01:14:36.218]  I don't have time to do it because Bartlett's coming up here in about 10-12 minutes.
[01:14:37.458 --> 01:14:51.284]  Just put out a post that, breaking, Governor of Colorado responds to citizens' Ebola outbreak concerns.
[01:14:53.305 --> 01:14:57.127]  And then just say Alex Jones is about to cover this live with a medical doctor, okay?
[01:14:57.907 --> 01:14:58.467]  Something like that.
[01:14:59.088 --> 01:15:07.492]  Because if everybody gets excited and takes that link and pushes it, instead of reaching the 3 million people, and that's a conservative number, they're tuned in right now.
[01:15:08.462 --> 01:15:12.004]  And then the couple million that'll watch this later other places, we can get 10, 20 million.
[01:15:12.684 --> 01:15:15.626]  Because it's not about picking on a hospital in Colorado.
[01:15:15.666 --> 01:15:16.926]  That's how they made the story.
[01:15:17.166 --> 01:15:25.871]  We pointed out they injected the hospital staff with the experimental shot and we showed you all the medical literature and even mainstream news concerned that that shot sheds.
[01:15:26.251 --> 01:15:30.333]  And they admit, oh it sheds, it just doesn't shed the full Ebola virus.
[01:15:33.735 --> 01:15:37.617]  We've had Dr. Judy Mikovits who worked on the Ebola vaccine for the Pentagon.
[01:15:38.717 --> 01:15:40.378]  Talk about all the other stuff it's full of.
[01:15:40.478 --> 01:15:41.719]  All the cancer viruses.
[01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:42.479]  You name it.
[01:15:42.499 --> 01:15:44.320]  And that was on Fox News yesterday.
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:45.401]  Or two days ago.
[01:15:45.421 --> 01:15:46.121]  We played it yesterday.
[01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:48.162]  So they hope you're stupid.
[01:15:48.182 --> 01:15:50.504]  And they hope to go, oh, Alex Jones is discredited.
[01:15:50.844 --> 01:15:54.126]  He's attacked a hospital and said they're launching bio-attacks.
[01:15:54.186 --> 01:15:55.426]  I said no such thing.
[01:15:56.067 --> 01:15:58.208]  I said they're using the hospital staff like guinea pigs.
[01:15:58.588 --> 01:16:03.131]  And I pointed out the Pentagon base down the road, which they admit is running the project.
[01:16:04.111 --> 01:16:05.172]  Everything we said's true.
[01:16:07.585 --> 01:16:15.548]  But it's so frustrating, so I want everybody to go to Real Alex Jones on Twitter as soon as this tweet goes out on the live feed of the show.
[01:16:16.109 --> 01:16:30.255]  We've already got a lot of people tuning in, but if you get excited, and if you all retweet it, and repost it, or physically call people, or send it in text messages to friends and neighbors and families, or your whole email list and say, hey, did you know there are injected people with a virus that sloughs and sheds?
[01:16:32.352 --> 01:16:38.953]  And look, I was already going to cover the state and not get Bartlett on, and then he called me and said, hey, I'm sending you a bunch of stuff, they're full of crap.
[01:16:40.234 --> 01:16:45.875]  I already had this stack of research, government documents, studies, everything, to show they're full of crap.
[01:16:46.055 --> 01:16:47.515]  Yeah, I could go eight hours with this, okay?
[01:16:49.495 --> 01:16:56.177]  Bartlett just sent me all this, okay?
[01:16:57.197 --> 01:17:02.476]   So, So, I mean, this is just insane.
[01:17:03.337 --> 01:17:17.479]  They do not want a discussion about how China had that dangerous lab, and we've got labs even far more dangerous here, including labs that are producing mousepox that can spread into humans with humanized mice that kills over 90% of people.
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.120]  And they're having congressional hearings about this.
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:23.521]  Look, I love my family, and by extension, I love you.
[01:17:27.901 --> 01:17:30.382]  I don't want to be exposed to this.
[01:17:31.876 --> 01:17:33.417]  And they claim it's for biodefense.
[01:17:33.818 --> 01:17:35.499]  That's a load of horse manure, folks.
[01:17:37.941 --> 01:17:39.822]  This is about total control.
[01:17:39.882 --> 01:17:48.529]  And I've got so many documents for The Globalist say the next big thing is going to be airborne Ebola, which is what they're working on at the lab.
[01:17:48.729 --> 01:17:55.974]  And there's been, I didn't even know this, mainstream news articles with scientists calling this lab out, not the hospital, again.
[01:17:56.986 --> 01:18:00.569]  It's in the WikiLeaks that they're doing Aleister Crowley rituals with the Podestas.
[01:18:01.170 --> 01:18:06.154]  The Podestas are in the Washington Post in 2007 showing all their pedophile art.
[01:18:07.175 --> 01:18:07.936]  They actually show it.
[01:18:09.077 --> 01:18:11.019]  Not actual kids, but paintings of kids getting raped.
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:17.364]  And then they divert off to a pizza place where nothing was going on to then get us to cover that to say nothing's happening anywhere else.
[01:18:18.125 --> 01:18:19.366]  This is how they operate.
[01:18:20.467 --> 01:18:23.050]  So, they're trying to say we're attacking this hospital.
[01:18:24.104 --> 01:18:26.946]  When we pointed out they're doing testing with the shots on the hospital staff.
[01:18:27.767 --> 01:18:29.708]  It's like when I said 9-11's an inside job.
[01:18:31.389 --> 01:18:33.471]  They went, oh, you're saying the firefighters blew up the towers.
[01:18:33.671 --> 01:18:34.231]  No, I didn't say that.
[01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:40.876]  The firefighters told me, and the police told me, they were told there were bombs in the buildings, and they saw them go off, and I interviewed the police and firemen.
[01:18:41.096 --> 01:18:41.637]  The opposite.
[01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:45.280]  It's not saying radical Islam doesn't exist or wasn't involved.
[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:47.741]  It was saying there were clearly bombs in Building 7.
[01:18:48.402 --> 01:18:52.445]  But I had a good friend of mine, I've known for years, finally say, I don't believe all your conspiracies yesterday.
[01:18:54.332 --> 01:18:55.753]  Or two days ago, and I said, what are they?
[01:18:56.833 --> 01:19:00.094]  And he goes, well, I don't believe that no planes hit the towers.
[01:19:00.915 --> 01:19:01.995]  And I said, that's somebody else.
[01:19:02.415 --> 01:19:04.656]  Well, I don't believe lasers blew it up.
[01:19:04.816 --> 01:19:05.637]  That's somebody else.
[01:19:06.437 --> 01:19:07.357]  That's not me, see?
[01:19:08.038 --> 01:19:18.142]  And that's how they build these straw men over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[01:19:18.162 --> 01:19:23.884]  Now, I've already done an hour and 12 minutes of show.
[01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:32.669]  Now when you tune into regular talk radio, and that's what this is, talk radio on TV, you hear plugs every segment outside of the ads, because that's how they stay on air and how they advertise.
[01:19:33.956 --> 01:19:35.137]  People don't listen to the ads anymore.
[01:19:35.197 --> 01:19:35.757]  Everybody knows that.
[01:19:35.917 --> 01:19:37.038]  They listen to the plugs all the time.
[01:19:37.459 --> 01:19:39.060]  Have you heard one plug in an hour and twelve minutes?
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:39.280]  No.
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:40.961]  And that's my biggest problem.
[01:19:41.001 --> 01:19:46.805]  I'm like, God, how do I get the funding and how do we expand in the face of this and not just, you know, stay here at the same size?
[01:19:47.245 --> 01:19:48.907]  And it's like, well, get up off your ass.
[01:19:48.947 --> 01:19:51.969]  You know, trust in God, but as the Bedouins say, but tie up your camel.
[01:19:52.029 --> 01:19:55.371]  Or as Hunter S. Thompson said, trust in God, but row away from the rocks.
[01:19:55.411 --> 01:19:57.773]  You know, you're on a paddle boat being blown into the rocks.
[01:19:58.413 --> 01:20:00.295]  Paddle away from the rocks in the storm.
[01:20:02.236 --> 01:20:03.877]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:20:36.219 --> 01:20:39.902]  And we got the best there is, under the tongue, a dropper.
[01:20:40.223 --> 01:20:42.485]  Take a few drops today, especially in the winter.

[01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:52.891]   percent off DNA Force Plus when you get it with the real red pill and it's
[01:20:52.891 --> 01:20:56.271]   selling out too but not as quick as DNA Force. It'll be sold out within days.

[01:21:02.530 --> 01:21:10.390]   Get our newest product from Dr. Jones Naturals which is next level
[01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:15.081]   foundational energy the highest quality methylfolate. That's not methamphetamine
[01:21:15.081 --> 01:21:17.674]   but God it ought to be And I hate methamphetamine.
[01:21:17.694 --> 01:21:19.074]  I've taken it like three or four times in my life.
[01:21:19.794 --> 01:21:24.416]  But methyl just means souped up or boiled down or concentrated, transformed.
[01:21:25.057 --> 01:21:28.178]  It's folic acid broken into its final byproduct in the cells.
[01:21:28.898 --> 01:21:32.420]  And most people cannot absorb folic acid fully.
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:35.101]  White people, a lot of us, I'm at 12%.
[01:21:35.521 --> 01:21:36.542]  I've had my genetic testing done.
[01:21:37.396 --> 01:21:44.396]   Some of my cells, some areas they operate like superhuman levels, other areas I have crippling genetic things.
[01:21:44.396 --> 01:21:49.396]   Because white people are a mutation, which I'm proud to be, I have nothing against it or anything.
[01:21:49.396 --> 01:21:55.396]   But the point is that most white people, particularly northern Europeans, have a real problem in their cells.
[01:21:55.396 --> 01:21:58.396]  And you can look this up yourself, processing folic acid.
[01:21:58.631 --> 01:22:03.256]  That's what Popeye eats the spinach, that's strong in folic acid.
[01:22:03.856 --> 01:22:05.858]  A lot of birth defects are caused by lack of folic acid.
[01:22:06.159 --> 01:22:10.764]  Strong to the finish, cause I eat my spinach, I'm Popeye the Sailor Man, doot doot!

[01:22:38.397 --> 01:22:45.726]   My problem Discrediting the governor's office and this obvious deep state production against us.
[01:22:46.566 --> 01:22:49.207]  That's all over the news now in Colorado.
[01:22:50.387 --> 01:22:52.808]  We just got one newscast we're gonna play in a moment, but there's a bunch of them.
[01:22:55.289 --> 01:22:56.189]  Shows were over the target.
[01:22:57.069 --> 01:23:08.153]  And my frustration is, I could spend the next four or five hours, commercial free, if we were able to do that, just showing you so many articles and so many documents and so much proof, it'd make your head spin.
[01:23:08.513 --> 01:23:09.513]  We're gonna show you a lot of it here.
[01:23:10.882 --> 01:23:15.839]  But again, the way they deceive in this newscast...
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:31.728]  When we're talking about a biolab, we're talking about other labs, we've got a medical doctor on, investigative journalist, we're going over the evidence, we're showing studies that the virus sheds, but notice they go, well it does shed, but it's not full Ebola.
[01:23:31.768 --> 01:23:32.448]  We didn't say that.
[01:23:32.689 --> 01:23:42.234]  We say this isn't full Ebola, it's attenuated, but it still causes serious health problems in people that have autoimmune problems, and we showed you the study that the doctor that runs a hospital sent me.
[01:23:43.783 --> 01:23:53.208]  But they take it and they put out the defamation by editing me to claim a hospital is running a bio-attack on Colorado.
[01:23:53.768 --> 01:23:56.230]  Said no such thing!
[01:23:57.682 --> 01:24:03.844]  Said the Pentagon's running the project with the hospital and the laboratory nearby, and that it's very dangerous.
[01:24:04.064 --> 01:24:10.805]  And then I'm going to show you AP Reuters, USA Today, scientists all admitting specifically they're worried about this.
[01:24:11.085 --> 01:24:13.486]  And they're like, oh, why are you singling out Colorado?
[01:24:13.666 --> 01:24:15.026]  Because they're the most open.
[01:24:15.766 --> 01:24:17.987]  The governor says, well, other groups are doing it.
[01:24:18.347 --> 01:24:20.208]  Yeah, and they're keeping their mouths shut.
[01:24:21.848 --> 01:24:23.368]  I said that in Friday's report.
[01:24:23.628 --> 01:24:25.789]  I said, we know of other places are doing this.
[01:24:28.263 --> 01:24:32.330]  So again, deception, deception, deception, deception, deception.
[01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:40.383]  So play the short local newscast in Denver, and then go to this USA Today report, CDC labs face...
[01:24:41.431 --> 01:24:42.512]  Secret sanctions.
[01:24:43.053 --> 01:24:50.882]  I'm saying this CDC lab, not the hospital, is doing this Pentagon Ebola program and is using the hospital staff as the guinea pigs.
[01:24:51.462 --> 01:24:55.707]  And they turn it around, he's being mean to the hospital staff saying they're trying to kill people.
[01:24:56.168 --> 01:24:57.930]  Oh, look at this nice little nurse here.
[01:24:58.190 --> 01:24:59.031]  She didn't do that.
[01:24:59.131 --> 01:25:00.533]  Alex is being mean to the nurse.
[01:25:02.179 --> 01:25:04.361]  Next they'll say I'm peeing on their graves or something.
[01:25:04.401 --> 01:25:09.987]  I mean, it's just, you know, we caught Jones raping hospital staff or something.
[01:25:10.407 --> 01:25:16.714]  I mean, they just totally changed the subject because they don't want you to talk about all these labs they've built everywhere.
[01:25:19.159 --> 01:25:20.000]  And they strawman it.
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:26.068]  So play those two clips and we'll get Dr. Bartlett on, who's on his lunch break, heading up a hospital here in Texas.
[01:25:26.688 --> 01:25:30.913]  And then we'll have him speak to it and we'll go through the documents he sent us.
[01:25:30.973 --> 01:25:32.055]  And boy, are there a lot of them.
[01:25:33.456 --> 01:25:35.357]  Oh, oh, the Coloradan, that's the newspaper.
[01:25:35.837 --> 01:25:39.237]  Records reveal biological hazards at Fort Collins CDC.
[01:25:39.498 --> 01:25:41.118]  That's the lab he says is dangerous.
[01:25:41.358 --> 01:25:46.339]  But they don't show Dr. Bartlett, because he's been, you know, the head of the governor's task force and all the rest of it.
[01:25:46.639 --> 01:25:49.920]  No, they just show me and claim I'm saying all this.
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:53.501]  Show, oh, the Coloradan, USA Today.
[01:25:53.821 --> 01:25:58.662]  See, that's why they want it censored, so they can lie about us with impunity.
[01:25:59.082 --> 01:26:00.283]  Here's the club's back-to-back.
[01:26:00.303 --> 01:26:01.143]  We'll get Dr. Bartlett on.
[01:26:01.613 --> 01:26:06.117]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alec Jones' latest target is Denver Health.
[01:26:06.938 --> 01:26:19.150]  The man who's been ordered to pay a billion dollars in damages for saying that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax is now suggesting that the American government is preparing a secret bioweapons program in Colorado.
[01:26:20.011 --> 01:26:24.916]  His conspiracy echoes and builds on claims made by conservatives from our state.
[01:26:25.814 --> 01:26:31.037]  They're trying to create a secret project to have Ebola cases and then test on people that have Ebola.
[01:26:31.438 --> 01:26:34.139]  It's a whole secret Ebola testing project in Colorado.
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:35.280]  That's what it looks like to me.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:37.342]  Here's what it looks like in reality.
[01:26:37.562 --> 01:26:48.049]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is seizing on a nine-news story about Denver health workers getting an Ebola vaccine, combined with right-wing fears about animal research being done at Colorado State University.
[01:26:48.729 --> 01:26:50.410]  So are you expecting an outbreak in Colorado?
[01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:57.552]  CSU is building an enclosure to study bats and their diseases, and that has drawn confusion and condemnation from the far right.
[01:26:58.012 --> 01:27:02.793]  Fort Collins is not exactly moving down a conservative path in any way, shape, or form.
[01:27:03.293 --> 01:27:07.115]  And to go from their transgender ideology to now their bat institution.
[01:27:07.355 --> 01:27:11.036]  The Ebola virus, the Marburg virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
[01:27:11.854 --> 01:27:15.936]  They're all going to be studied right here in Fort Collins in a bat lab.
[01:27:16.276 --> 01:27:21.159]  CSU says that claim by former GOP gubernatorial candidate Heidi Gnall is not true.
[01:27:21.259 --> 01:27:25.802]  Because this breeding facility is designed for just that, breeding and then some experiments.
[01:27:26.242 --> 01:27:37.328]  And those experiments will be done at something called Animal Biosafety Level 2, which is not an acceptable biosafety level for Ebola, Nympha, MERS, SARS-CoV-2.
[01:27:37.748 --> 01:27:46.792]  CSU reiterated today that the lab will not handle Ebola and will not be doing gain-of-function research on bat diseases, despite far-right claims to the contrary.
[01:27:47.493 --> 01:27:49.714]  Now to part two of the conspiracy theory.
[01:27:50.134 --> 01:27:56.897]  Ebola has a very high mortality rate, so it's exciting to be a part of this next step in treating this disease.
[01:27:57.197 --> 01:28:05.661]  Last November, members of Denver Health's high-risk infection team got the Ebola vaccine on the off chance that someone with that disease travels to Denver.
[01:28:06.241 --> 01:28:06.841]  The U.S.
[01:28:06.881 --> 01:28:13.883]  government has moved bioweapon labs to Denver and is injecting healthcare staff with live Ebola and it's shedding and spreading.
[01:28:14.283 --> 01:28:15.463]  That's the big takeaway, folks.
[01:28:15.523 --> 01:28:16.083]  Insanity.
[01:28:16.223 --> 01:28:23.184]  The CDC tells 9News that the vaccine contains only a portion of the Ebola virus to stimulate an immune response.
[01:28:23.584 --> 01:28:31.246]  So it would be impossible, the CDC says, for people who receive the vaccine to shed the full Ebola virus to others and infect them.
[01:28:31.826 --> 01:28:35.008]  Despite what America's most infamous conspiracy theorist claims.
[01:28:35.028 --> 01:28:37.170]  I mean, this doesn't even sound real.
[01:28:37.230 --> 01:28:38.030]  It's so crazy.
[01:28:39.151 --> 01:28:47.176]  Alex Jones' ranting about Denver health even got the attention of Colorado's Democratic Governor Jared Polis, who posed a common sense question on social media.
[01:28:47.957 --> 01:28:57.043]  Why would first responders getting the Ebola vaccine in Colorado be more of a danger than the first responders getting the same vaccine in a bunch of other states?
[01:28:57.628 --> 01:28:58.710]  Laboratories at the centers.
[01:28:58.971 --> 01:29:08.009]  Alright, we're going to go to this USA Today report real quick and then to Dr. Bartlett, but again, we have an interview with a medical doctor, we show a bunch of articles where they admit they're testing Ebola.
[01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:17.162]  And doing all this, and then they turn it all around and just say, oh, Alex Jones made it up, and then edit stuff out of context to say my target's the hospital.
[01:29:17.182 --> 01:29:25.764]  No, I said they gave hospital staff the shots, which they could then shed according to the medical doctor we had on, and he gave me the documents on that vaccine saying that, and I showed it on TV.
[01:29:26.144 --> 01:29:31.066]  And so the reporters watching my hour-long interview, they saw all of that.
[01:29:31.086 --> 01:29:32.766]  It was an hour and 30-minute interview, actually.
[01:29:34.606 --> 01:29:36.327]  They saw us show all that.
[01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:40.892]  But they're preying on their audience to deceive them.
[01:29:44.433 --> 01:29:47.075]  Here's a short report on the concerns of these labs.
[01:29:48.436 --> 01:29:54.019]  Laboratories at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention work with some of the world's most dangerous viruses and bacteria.
[01:29:54.499 --> 01:30:01.663]  And some of these pathogens, like anthrax, Ebola, and plague, are heavily regulated because of their potential to be used as weapons by terrorists.
[01:30:02.203 --> 01:30:14.669]   So it's important news that the CDC has now admitted to USA Today That the agency's own labs have faced secret enforcement action six times since 2003 for mishandling potential bioterror pathogens.
[01:30:15.190 --> 01:30:22.494]  The CDC not only operates numerous labs, it also regulates hundreds of public and private biodefense labs nationwide.
[01:30:23.194 --> 01:30:36.743]  The agency, citing security concerns, has refused for more than a year to disclose the names of five labs that have had their permits suspended and another five labs that have repeatedly been referred for enforcement actions because of serious safety violations.
[01:30:37.304 --> 01:30:52.868]   The CDC's admission this week That its own labs are among them came only after USA Today won a Freedom of Information Act appeal and obtained a letter showing that some of CDC's labs in Fort Collins, Colorado had their permits suspended from 2007 to 2010.
[01:30:54.508 --> 01:31:02.310]  CDC labs have been under scrutiny in the wake of several high-profile incidents in 2014 with anthrax, Ebola, and a deadly strain of flu.
[01:31:02.910 --> 01:31:07.851]  Read the USA Today Network's full investigation at biolabs.usatoday.com.
[01:31:08.571 --> 01:31:13.134]  Okay, so this specific lab we're talking about is on record messing around with Ebola.
[01:31:13.454 --> 01:31:14.435]  They've gotten in trouble.
[01:31:14.515 --> 01:31:15.615]  You just saw USA Today.
[01:31:15.916 --> 01:31:19.358]  But you just saw local news, and the governors say, we're liars.
[01:31:19.918 --> 01:31:25.601]  Let's bring in a gentleman that's headed up and been on governors' task forces here in Texas, runs hospitals, you name it.
[01:31:26.001 --> 01:31:30.264]  Medical doctor Richard Bartlett, who's simply raising the alarm as a public service.
[01:31:30.584 --> 01:31:31.665]  We're four minutes to break, sir.
[01:31:31.685 --> 01:31:33.286]  You've got the floor to set the table here.
[01:31:33.546 --> 01:31:35.007]  But boy, they've jumped the shark, it seems.
[01:31:36.224 --> 01:31:43.728]  Alex, it looks like you might be over the target, and maybe we're going to convince them not to do this in the middle of our country because of the spotlight.
[01:31:45.009 --> 01:31:46.450]  Thank you for what you do with InfoWars.
[01:31:46.770 --> 01:32:01.498]  But the bottom line is, they cannot refute that a new bat lab, which looks like it's going to be Wuhan 2.0 on steroids, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, is already slated to be built right there in Fort Collins.
[01:32:02.473 --> 01:32:03.114]  That's a fact.
[01:32:03.474 --> 01:32:05.195]  And you expose that.
[01:32:05.235 --> 01:32:16.684]  You also expose the fact that there is an Ebola vaccine that has been given to Denver health workers, paramedics, nurses, and doctors in anticipation of a possible future Ebola outbreak.
[01:32:17.124 --> 01:32:17.765]  They say that.
[01:32:18.365 --> 01:32:19.386]  And you expose that.
[01:32:19.466 --> 01:32:20.887]  Those are irrefutable facts.
[01:32:21.308 --> 01:32:22.769]  And so there's a lot of spin.
[01:32:23.409 --> 01:32:25.491]  There's a lot of things that they didn't cover in their story.
[01:32:25.511 --> 01:32:30.455]  And they admit in the newscast that it can shed, but they go, don't worry, it's not the full Ebola.
[01:32:30.475 --> 01:32:31.796]  Well, you said that on the show.
[01:32:32.702 --> 01:32:33.703]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:32:33.723 --> 01:32:40.048]  It does have a segment of Ebola genetically engineered into a virus that is very contagious.
[01:32:40.929 --> 01:32:44.852]  Because Ebola itself is not extremely contagious.
[01:32:45.172 --> 01:32:46.213]  And it's also dangerous.
[01:32:46.233 --> 01:32:46.553]  Explain this.
[01:32:46.593 --> 01:32:47.994]  You're saying they've created a virus vector?
[01:32:49.215 --> 01:33:04.093]   So they have taken a virus, vaccinia virus, is how you say it, and they have spliced in genetic code from Ebola Into that virus and that virus is a it's a live virus vaccine.
[01:33:04.193 --> 01:33:05.935]  So you were you were exactly correct.
[01:33:05.975 --> 01:33:10.840]  It is a live virus vaccine and in their FDA package insert.
[01:33:11.601 --> 01:33:14.544]  It can't it does have shedding 31% of the time.
[01:33:14.964 --> 01:33:19.288]  31.7% is the term is the number that they put in the package insert.
[01:33:19.348 --> 01:33:23.873]  So anyone can do an online search of the Hervebo vaccine.
[01:33:25.106 --> 01:33:27.207]  Package insert, and they can read it for themselves.
[01:33:27.227 --> 01:33:34.069]  They can also read that there hasn't been testing, according to the package insert, on how this would affect people that are immune compromised.
[01:33:34.129 --> 01:33:36.050]  You covered that in your segment.
[01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:42.932]  And so there's a lot of things that you said that are just straight out of the FDA package insert.
[01:33:43.812 --> 01:33:49.674]  Of course, they're not giving the full-blown deadly Ebola itself as a shot in the arm.
[01:33:49.794 --> 01:33:53.436]  They're giving a vaccine that's a live virus that sheds 31% of the time.
[01:33:55.336 --> 01:34:00.178]  And so there is a concern with that, but the question that you raised is why?
[01:34:00.519 --> 01:34:06.802]  Why is Denver Health vaccinating people now for a potential Ebola outbreak?
[01:34:07.082 --> 01:34:09.423]  What do they know and what are they preparing for?
[01:34:09.563 --> 01:34:15.802]   Well, disconnected from that, they're building a new bat lab, which looks, by all accounts,
[01:34:15.802 --> 01:34:23.283]   to be a Wuhan Institute of Virology 2.0 on steroids right down the highway, 65 miles north at Port Collins.
[01:34:23.283 --> 01:34:34.601]   And so you just played a segment showing that there were past lab safety issues in Port Collins.
[01:34:34.244 --> 01:34:45.911]  And so, these things are irrefutable, and people can make their own decision on what's going to happen, but you know the amazing thing about free speech in the United States is when you sound the alarm, sometimes bad things don't happen.
[01:34:46.271 --> 01:34:48.372]  And so I appreciate you sounding the alarm.
[01:34:48.572 --> 01:34:49.793]  Well, I really respect you.
[01:34:49.813 --> 01:34:54.656]  You were day one exposed early with COVID, so you call me and say this is important, we'll get you on.
[01:34:54.676 --> 01:34:57.698]  Notice they took you out of the newscast and a bunch of other reports.
[01:34:57.958 --> 01:35:00.239]  They didn't want to mention you or respect a doctor, though.
[01:35:00.619 --> 01:35:01.000]  I noticed.
[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:02.740]  I noticed that.
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:05.961]  I noticed that this was a hit job, in my opinion.
[01:35:05.981 --> 01:35:07.302]  That's my opinion.
[01:35:07.402 --> 01:35:14.384]  But they were trying to dissuade the public from the reality that something has happened that's historic.
[01:35:14.885 --> 01:35:27.109]  Denver Health, the main health center for a crisis in all of Colorado, is vaccinating people in November, just two months ago, for Ebola, for a future potential Ebola outbreak.
[01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:30.914]  I think that's the news and that's what they don't want to talk about.
[01:35:30.994 --> 01:35:31.835]  Stay right there.
[01:35:31.855 --> 01:35:33.057]  Stay right there.
[01:35:33.658 --> 01:35:35.701]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's happening.
[01:35:36.182 --> 01:35:39.387]  Two years in the making and we didn't plan it like this because we didn't know.
[01:35:40.211 --> 01:35:48.359]  To release Alex Jones New World Order Wars that's all about fighting Epstein and Clinton and Hillary and the Deep State and the pedo rings.
[01:35:48.499 --> 01:35:52.664]  Whole levels just dealing with that because that's the truth about how they operate.
[01:35:52.944 --> 01:35:57.108]  And now the game went on Steam, the biggest online platform of video games in the world.
[01:35:57.128 --> 01:35:57.949]  150 million users a week.
[01:36:00.231 --> 01:36:02.132]  And it already shot to number one.
[01:36:02.413 --> 01:36:11.078]  So find the link to Steam at AlexJonesGame.com or search Alex Jones New World Order Wars at Steam and get it for yourself.
[01:36:11.258 --> 01:36:15.721]  It's got an incredible 97% reviews.
[01:36:15.941 --> 01:36:20.024]  We'll put the link to Steam on screen and to AlexJonesGame.com.
[01:36:20.384 --> 01:36:20.705]  Get it.
[01:36:21.485 --> 01:36:22.846]  We are taking back the culture.
[01:36:22.886 --> 01:36:23.927]  We are taking things back.
[01:36:24.207 --> 01:36:25.508]  This will fund the InfoWar.
[01:36:25.568 --> 01:36:27.008]  Going into the election in the next 10 months.
[01:36:27.429 --> 01:36:29.150]  Don't let me fail you if you don't take action.
[01:36:29.210 --> 01:36:31.971]  Get New World Order Wars by Alex Jones now!
[01:36:33.412 --> 01:36:33.712]  All right.
[01:36:34.873 --> 01:36:37.835]  Dr. Richard Bartlett is our guest.
[01:36:39.576 --> 01:36:42.958]  He's been appointed by Texas Governor's Head Up Task Force.
[01:36:43.678 --> 01:36:45.039]  He's headed up hospitals, you name it.
[01:36:45.079 --> 01:36:45.740]  He's a great M.D.
[01:36:46.878 --> 01:36:52.560]  And he works with investigative journalist John Fleetwood at JohnFleetwood.com, also BDEC9Works.com, which doesn't sell BDEC9.
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:37:04.283]  He helped get that out up there up front and save millions around the world that learned about it, ahead of Oxford and other major research facilities saying BDEC9 is amazing for COVID.
[01:37:04.844 --> 01:37:06.664]  That's just a side issue, but just remember that.
[01:37:07.024 --> 01:37:08.845]  He's doing this all as a public service.
[01:37:10.226 --> 01:37:14.869]  So, Doc, we know we're under the target when they go crazy, and I'm not pushing this on you or giving you the credit, it's just true.
[01:37:15.409 --> 01:37:32.601]  You were saying earlier, yes, Alex, you were right about this, this, and that, but you sent me all the documents, the hospital announcements, the labs, the CDC documents, the admissions of testing, developing counters to Ebola, by these research facilities, so I was right because I was going off what you sent me.
[01:37:33.002 --> 01:37:48.649]   You sent me even more here, but to have the governor come out against us, to not just the newscast we air, but a bunch of others, Freak out and change the subject and build a straw man that we're attacking the hospital workers and saying they're involved in a secret bioweapon program.
[01:37:49.489 --> 01:37:52.930]  Well, I guess they are being tested on, but we're not saying they're guilty or bad people.
[01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:53.690]  They mean well.
[01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:56.991]  They're trying to change the subject, so they're acting hysterical.
[01:37:57.611 --> 01:38:10.537]  And then you sent me USA Today and Colorado News articles, I got a whole stack we'll go through here, so when you want them, call for them, I've got them all right here, where there's been major problems at the facility where they're building the now larger facility that you're calling Wuhan 2.0.
[01:38:12.538 --> 01:38:22.363]  So yeah, they're definitely scared of something, and Congress is investigating gain-of-function, now they're trying to deny these labs are doing gain-of-function, it's totally illegal, but they are.
[01:38:22.443 --> 01:38:34.368]   So this is really a discussion about I saw in the local paper last week, people are upset about a giant monkey farm with 40,000 monkeys and apes, where they're going to be doing all sorts of biological testing east of Austin in Bastrop.
[01:38:34.888 --> 01:38:37.610]  That's normal, like you have a nuclear power plant next door to you.
[01:38:37.650 --> 01:38:45.253]  You want to know who's running it, you want to know what's happening, but instead they want to just throw it out there and say we're all crazy, as we've already seen the lab leak from Wuhan.
[01:38:45.293 --> 01:38:47.834]  So, walk through this for people and why this is so important.
[01:38:48.897 --> 01:38:50.858]  So Alex, I want to make a point.
[01:38:51.218 --> 01:39:00.021]  They did not call United States Senator Joni Ernst about this lab, bat lab, that's being put in the middle of the United States in Colorado.
[01:39:00.582 --> 01:39:04.043]  Although she has already been very vocal and public about this.
[01:39:04.783 --> 01:39:12.826]  And so if they, if they, you know, why aren't they asking, acknowledging that a United States, there's only a hundred United States senators.
[01:39:13.307 --> 01:39:14.347]  They're at a very high level.
[01:39:14.407 --> 01:39:16.968]  They get intelligence briefings that you and I don't get.
[01:39:17.478 --> 01:39:18.959]  Why aren't they talking to her?
[01:39:19.019 --> 01:39:32.508]  I bet they haven't reached out to Joni Erst or even shown her quotes that she said about this specific bat lab being put there and about the potential of an outbreak.
[01:39:33.249 --> 01:39:34.149]  That's her concern.
[01:39:34.810 --> 01:39:35.951]  A United States Senator.
[01:39:36.511 --> 01:39:38.012]  Alex, why wouldn't they mention her?
[01:39:40.714 --> 01:39:42.135]  Because they don't want to mention credible people.
[01:39:42.155 --> 01:39:43.676]  They want to just act like I made this up.
[01:39:44.665 --> 01:39:45.726]  Well, you know what?
[01:39:45.786 --> 01:39:48.768]  You have the ear of millions of people every day.
[01:39:49.408 --> 01:39:52.350]  And so you've said many things that...
[01:39:53.433 --> 01:39:59.196]  We're absolutely credible and at the tip of the spear as far as saving lives.
[01:39:59.276 --> 01:40:09.340]  And one of those things you said was about budesonide, that we have a tool that could be used against COVID, when they were saying there's nothing you can do, just hide in place and do not bother the hospitals.
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:16.103]  Yeah, well my dad couldn't get out of bed and had 87% oxygen and was going to die until you got him that prescription and I got him to breathe it.
[01:40:17.045 --> 01:40:19.646]  But you know what, this is the Budesonite for COVID.
[01:40:19.666 --> 01:40:26.329]  Just to clarify that you have been at the tip of the spear with the facts when they were hidden by mainstream media.
[01:40:28.150 --> 01:40:30.191]  This was Budesonite against COVID.
[01:40:30.651 --> 01:40:37.474]  You talked about it before it was breaking in Oxford University, the oldest university in the English-speaking world.
[01:40:38.375 --> 01:40:41.095]  72 Nobel Prize laureates. That's pretty credible.
[01:40:41.095 --> 01:40:44.673]   Well, Doc, we just talked to experts like you. So look at these other headlines.
[01:40:44.673 --> 01:40:48.854]   USA Today, CDC finds lapses in latest lab mishap with Ebola virus.
[01:40:48.854 --> 01:40:53.614]   And they specifically, in these different articles, list this lab that's being expanded.
[01:40:53.614 --> 01:40:56.894]  CDC chief, anthrax gaff should never have happened.
[01:40:56.894 --> 01:41:00.694]  Colorado lab developing Ebola vaccine for military use.
[01:41:00.743 --> 01:41:01.584]  That's all we said.
[01:41:01.624 --> 01:41:02.744]  They claim that's not true.
[01:41:03.044 --> 01:41:04.105]  There's USA Today.
[01:41:04.766 --> 01:41:05.546]  BioMark.
[01:41:06.066 --> 01:41:07.327]  You sent me all the documents.
[01:41:07.387 --> 01:41:09.749]  Talk about these documents and what we know is really going on.
[01:41:09.769 --> 01:41:11.229]  I mean, look at this headline.
[01:41:11.550 --> 01:41:16.052]  Newly disclosed CDC BioLab failures like a screenplay for a disaster movie.
[01:41:16.433 --> 01:41:17.153]  USA Today.
[01:41:17.373 --> 01:41:18.634]  But we're bad for saying it.
[01:41:19.806 --> 01:41:21.587]  Alex, let's just look at the facts.
[01:41:21.667 --> 01:41:22.807]  You're presenting evidence.
[01:41:23.147 --> 01:41:24.288]  You're presenting evidence.
[01:41:24.388 --> 01:41:37.073]  USA Today is about as mainstream media as it gets, and so what they were reporting as early as 2014, 2016, and doing FOIA requests to the U.S.
[01:41:37.113 --> 01:41:41.734]  Congress, that's one source of information in their FOIA requests.
[01:41:41.794 --> 01:41:46.296]  They won those suits, and they got information that was heavily redacted.
[01:41:46.937 --> 01:41:48.040]  People can just go to that.
[01:41:48.301 --> 01:41:53.153]  Go to these, look up these stories that Alex Jones, you are showing right now.
[01:41:53.672 --> 01:41:57.053]  To the whole world that are not being highlighted to the people that call out.
[01:41:57.153 --> 01:41:58.353]  And by the way, Dr. Barrow, that's key.
[01:41:58.713 --> 01:42:10.835]  Mainstream media was never perfect, and they would lie when they were paid for like a war or something, but until about 2015 or so, they still broke a lot of stuff, like Bayer knowingly was putting HIV in there, Factor VIII, and hepatitis.
[01:42:11.355 --> 01:42:13.376]  But they all got bought off right after that.
[01:42:13.656 --> 01:42:18.917]  So we can go back to the article specifically about these labs, and it's all there, but nothing after 2016.
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:26.562]  Again, Alex, read those headlines so people can look at this for themselves on their own cell phones.
[01:42:27.383 --> 01:42:28.603]  This is USA Today.
[01:42:28.983 --> 01:42:30.044]  Look at these articles.
[01:42:30.224 --> 01:42:30.624]  Read them.
[01:42:30.684 --> 01:42:31.224]  There's links.
[01:42:32.304 --> 01:42:34.365]  And the evidence is there.
[01:42:34.665 --> 01:42:36.706]  You and I didn't do this legwork.
[01:42:36.806 --> 01:42:37.707]  Yeah, you mentioned it.
[01:42:37.727 --> 01:42:38.347]  We have U.S.
[01:42:38.387 --> 01:42:40.508]  Senators raising lab leak concerns.
[01:42:40.808 --> 01:42:41.508]  That's what you just said.
[01:42:41.548 --> 01:42:44.089]  So we're bad, but the Senator's raising it.
[01:42:45.114 --> 01:43:07.635]  Right, so, you know what, if they want to watch this show, what they're going to learn is that there's evidence since 2014 that mainstream media, USA Today, was concerned, and Voicing Opinions, and that Congress itself was concerned, and there were congressional hearings about lab discrepancies and injuries and violations with the CDC.
[01:43:07.855 --> 01:43:14.797]   I have learned, looking at what has been out in the mainstream media back in 2014 and 16, if you
[01:43:14.797 --> 01:43:22.788]   look at what the links are for the USA Today, that at that time, the CDC was regulating themselves. What
[01:43:22.788 --> 01:43:26.547]   can go wrong if you're going to be holding yourself accountable? Where's the
[01:43:26.547 --> 01:43:33.698]   checks and balances? I didn't see any evidence of checks and balances. That's a problem.
[01:43:33.698 --> 01:43:38.837]   But you said at the start of the interview, they're running around like chickens with their heads cut
[01:43:38.837 --> 01:43:39.137]  off.
[01:43:39.275 --> 01:43:41.957]  You don't like to speculate, but clearly they're freaking out over this.
[01:43:41.997 --> 01:43:45.901]  Why would the governor come out against us when we're only quoting, like you said, a U.S.
[01:43:45.941 --> 01:43:46.202]  senator?
[01:43:47.462 --> 01:43:50.145]  I think it's newsworthy, at least.
[01:43:50.325 --> 01:43:51.906]  And apparently they think it's newsworthy.
[01:43:52.687 --> 01:43:55.369]  You know, they were just bragging that they were vaccinating people.
[01:43:55.409 --> 01:43:56.430]  And you know what?
[01:43:56.930 --> 01:44:07.079]  I'm pro real vaccines to protect people, but that's not the only public health measure that has had huge benefits to humanity in the last 200 years.
[01:44:07.599 --> 01:44:09.301]  Clean food and clean water have done that.
[01:44:09.461 --> 01:44:13.204]  And so you look at third world countries, that's still their biggest problem.
[01:44:13.783 --> 01:44:17.925]  And that's how there are outbreaks, because of a lack of clean food and clean water.
[01:44:17.945 --> 01:44:18.345]  You're right.
[01:44:18.445 --> 01:44:20.126]  In fact, sanitation is what did most of it.
[01:44:20.166 --> 01:44:20.546]  I agree.
[01:44:20.906 --> 01:44:22.927]  If there's a real disease, I want a clean vaccine.
[01:44:23.047 --> 01:44:24.788]  Why can't we get companies to do that?
[01:44:25.108 --> 01:44:27.088]  I guess because they have liability protection, they have no reason to.
[01:44:27.969 --> 01:44:28.249]  Right.
[01:44:28.809 --> 01:44:40.614]  So, you know, Alex, why do, if I turn on the TV, I'm going to watch a dozen new medicines commercials, and they're going to, at the end of it, talk real fast.
[01:44:41.344 --> 01:44:45.125]  And they're going to say it can cause headache, fever, diarrhea, death, and they're going to list a bunch of other things.
[01:44:45.225 --> 01:44:47.206]  And people are going to think, dang, why would I take that?
[01:44:48.246 --> 01:44:49.046]  But you know what?
[01:44:49.406 --> 01:44:50.986]  With vaccines, they don't have to do that.
[01:44:51.647 --> 01:44:52.747]  They have not had to.
[01:44:53.687 --> 01:44:55.268]  They should ethically and morally.
[01:44:55.868 --> 01:44:58.208]  But legally, they don't have to because they can't be sued.
[01:44:58.248 --> 01:45:03.950]  Vaccine manufacturers cannot be sued because of a law that was passed by Congress in 1986.
[01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:07.111]  I think all your viewers probably know that.
[01:45:07.171 --> 01:45:07.811]  But you know what?
[01:45:09.849 --> 01:45:12.895]  Local news in Colorado is watching this.
[01:45:12.935 --> 01:45:14.779]  They may have heard that for the first time just now.
[01:45:15.751 --> 01:45:17.032]  Well, final segment, doctor.
[01:45:17.052 --> 01:45:17.952]  I know you're on your lunch.
[01:45:18.352 --> 01:45:20.573]  Let's come back and talk about what we do about this.
[01:45:20.613 --> 01:45:21.934]  They don't want us investigating it.
[01:45:22.174 --> 01:45:23.054]  They don't want us looking at it.
[01:45:23.374 --> 01:45:24.635]  Why is that?
[01:45:24.995 --> 01:45:28.236]  They're really scared of this report, because he sent me the documents.
[01:45:28.517 --> 01:45:30.017]  They admit, they've been on the newscast.
[01:45:30.057 --> 01:45:34.699]  Yeah, this, you take this shot, it sheds Ebola, but it's weakened, which we said.
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:36.780]  I had a bunch of breaking news here.
[01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:39.721]  British UK chief says, U.S.
[01:45:39.741 --> 01:45:42.503]  will be called up for a national draft for war with Russia.
[01:45:43.303 --> 01:45:46.084]  That's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:45:46.504 --> 01:45:46.764]  Wow.
[01:45:47.764 --> 01:45:51.365]  And you got the Germans saying it, the Swedes saying it of all people.
[01:45:52.145 --> 01:45:54.586]  It's just getting crazier and crazier.
[01:45:55.186 --> 01:46:02.588]  Dr. Bartlett of all the different Colorado and Denver Post and USA Today articles he sent me and studies he sent me.
[01:46:02.608 --> 01:46:05.129]  He keeps being nice saying, Alex, you were right about this and that.
[01:46:05.229 --> 01:46:06.329]  I just read everything he sent me.
[01:46:08.487 --> 01:46:09.947]  They are right here with the U.S.
[01:46:09.988 --> 01:46:11.928]  Senator talking about what a danger this is.
[01:46:11.968 --> 01:46:19.230]  But notice, the media doesn't talk about the Senator or all the violations at the lab they're expanding in Colorado.
[01:46:20.411 --> 01:46:22.732]  They talk about me like I made it up.
[01:46:23.672 --> 01:46:27.373]  I've been chosen as the guy they say is the liar, because they know you're listening.
[01:46:27.713 --> 01:46:29.054]  And they know other people are about to listen.
[01:46:29.074 --> 01:46:30.374]  They want to say, oh, don't listen to that guy.
[01:46:30.674 --> 01:46:31.514]  Well, don't listen to me.
[01:46:32.395 --> 01:46:33.275]  Do your own research.
[01:46:34.642 --> 01:46:35.383]  So here's an article.
[01:46:35.563 --> 01:46:42.571]  A new bat lab proposed despite CDC's past serious safety violations while working with bioterror pathogens in Colorado.
[01:46:42.591 --> 01:46:47.636]  And then it's got a link here out of Fort Collins and the lab.
[01:46:47.656 --> 01:46:50.880]  And I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to read this quote to you right now.
[01:46:53.447 --> 01:47:04.291]  Reacting to the news of the new bat research facility, Iowa Senator Joni Ernest, a Republican, warned, We cannot allow any batty experiments on our pandemic potential to be unleashed on our own shores.
[01:47:04.771 --> 01:47:13.835]  Americans have suffered enough from faulty funding, risky research, which is why I'm working to defund EcoHealth, the taxpayer-funded dollars to the Chinese state-run Wuhan lab, she added.
[01:47:14.155 --> 01:47:16.776]  The world cannot afford another lab leak, especially one on U.S.
[01:47:16.816 --> 01:47:17.096]  soil.
[01:47:17.856 --> 01:47:19.218]  Or near our military bases.
[01:47:19.519 --> 01:47:22.243]  And then they admit that the so-called vaccine leaks.
[01:47:22.703 --> 01:47:24.386]  So, Doc, we got a few minutes left here.
[01:47:24.726 --> 01:47:27.250]  Closing comments, because this is obviously a big story.
[01:47:28.371 --> 01:47:29.113]  Now it's blown up.
[01:47:29.153 --> 01:47:30.434]  They're trying to cover up.
[01:47:30.475 --> 01:47:31.236]  They're very desperate.
[01:47:32.017 --> 01:47:34.840]  Yeah, so why don't they ask Joni Ernst?
[01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:37.462]  So this is the United States Senator from Iowa.
[01:47:38.002 --> 01:47:42.927]  Her first responsibility is to the people of Iowa, but she also cares about the United States.
[01:47:43.487 --> 01:47:47.851]  And so why does she consider this a concern for the people of Iowa when it's in Colorado?
[01:47:48.292 --> 01:47:52.315]  Well, apparently she knows something about this, and I agree with her statement entirely.
[01:47:52.375 --> 01:47:55.298]  We can't afford another Ebola, another outbreak.
[01:47:55.794 --> 01:48:00.016]  Another pandemic that starts in the middle of our country, we can't, and we can't afford a lab leak.
[01:48:00.556 --> 01:48:02.897]  And so who can argue with what she said?
[01:48:03.477 --> 01:48:04.318]  But you know what?
[01:48:04.338 --> 01:48:07.099]  I bet they don't read her quote that you just read.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:08.820]  That's newsworthy.
[01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:20.365]  And so I just want to point that out, that even though she's from Iowa, she's a United States senator that has a concern about this very bat lab project that's under works right now.
[01:48:21.085 --> 01:48:22.026]  And that's her opinion.
[01:48:22.306 --> 01:48:24.547]  And I think her opinion is weighty.
[01:48:25.485 --> 01:48:32.790]  Uh, you know, again, uh, there's also, uh, reports, um, what is the name of that?
[01:48:33.250 --> 01:48:42.236]  Uh, uh, so here's, here's another, uh, a quote that I have found in the, from the Coloradan.
[01:48:42.956 --> 01:48:50.801]  You can go to coloradan.com and the story title is Records Reveal Biological Hazards at Fort Collins CDC.
[01:48:51.382 --> 01:49:00.544]   And the quote is, two of the Fort Collins incidents involved Select agents, pathogens included on a federal list of potential bioterror pathogens.
[01:49:00.645 --> 01:49:12.472]  The list includes pathogens such as those that cause anthrax, Ebola, plague, and certain avian or reconstituted flu virus strains.
[01:49:13.709 --> 01:49:14.069]  Hello.
[01:49:14.089 --> 01:49:21.096]  Um, we're just talking about the facts and stuff that's already been reported, but you're putting it all together for the people and you're not burying it.
[01:49:21.156 --> 01:49:22.397]  Like they're distracting.
[01:49:22.437 --> 01:49:28.563]  They're doing smoking mirrors, trying to distract from what your message was for an hour long show the other day.
[01:49:29.144 --> 01:49:32.487]  And so they're cherry picking and just, and, and, and they're spinning.
[01:49:33.092 --> 01:49:41.794]  But they're not doing it honestly, in my opinion, because... Yeah, we never said the nurses and doctors at Colorado Health are running a bioweapon program.
[01:49:41.814 --> 01:49:48.436]  We said the Pentagon publicly is running one, using the hospital as guinea pigs, and all the experts agree it's dangerous, including a U.S.
[01:49:48.476 --> 01:49:48.776]  Senator.
[01:49:49.936 --> 01:50:00.019]  Well, yeah, the United States Senator says this bat lab that's being created is a problem, and her quote that you just read, I think, is crystal clear about the threat.
[01:50:01.292 --> 01:50:04.213]  And she's saying we can't afford this again, and she's exactly right.
[01:50:05.573 --> 01:50:07.253]  I know you agree with what her statement is.
[01:50:07.333 --> 01:50:08.013]  I do as well.
[01:50:08.553 --> 01:50:09.894]  Who would not agree with that?
[01:50:10.614 --> 01:50:19.815]  But the fact that they're vaccinating for Ebola for a potential future outbreak right down the road from Fort Collins, where this bat lab is being put in, is the news.
[01:50:20.436 --> 01:50:21.796]  Why are they concerned?
[01:50:21.996 --> 01:50:23.036]  Why are they preparing?
[01:50:23.796 --> 01:50:28.097]  Not just concerned, but they're actually preparing for a potential Ebola outbreak.
[01:50:28.817 --> 01:50:29.538]  In Colorado.
[01:50:29.738 --> 01:50:38.647]  Why would they do that in Denver, 65 miles away from where a new bat lab is coming in, and the quote that Joni Irv says is very crystal clear.
[01:50:38.907 --> 01:50:43.151]  So they're very upset we're spotlighting this, and now we're moving to the area of speculation.
[01:50:43.632 --> 01:50:46.214]  You're a medical doctor, been on the governor's task forces, you name it.
[01:50:46.475 --> 01:50:49.017]  Got another guy coming in here who's been on the governor's task forces with the border.
[01:50:51.179 --> 01:50:52.621]  Clearly they do not want us looking at this.
[01:50:53.621 --> 01:51:00.863]  Well, and therefore we're going to look at it and we're going to sound the alarm so that nothing bad happens to American people because we care about American people.
[01:51:00.903 --> 01:51:01.463]  And by the way, that's key.
[01:51:01.803 --> 01:51:12.547]  We came out in August from my border patrol and TSA sources and said they're planning mask controls, which they tried, but because we got ahead of it, they backed down.
[01:51:12.967 --> 01:51:15.047]  We're here trying to stop this, folks.
[01:51:16.168 --> 01:51:17.368]  And I think that's why they're pissed.
[01:51:18.277 --> 01:51:25.801]  Well, we have a four-year track record of what can go wrong with medical tyranny, using medical excuses for tyranny.
[01:51:26.402 --> 01:51:34.346]  And, you know, four years later, we hear that there was no science behind the six-foot apart social distancing from Fauci himself.
[01:51:35.467 --> 01:51:40.229]  You know, we see the evidence coming out over and over about masks and mask mandates.
[01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:46.253]  Well, he admitted in a congressional testimony you mentioned two weeks ago that they had no evidence of masks and no evidence of social distancing.
[01:51:47.062 --> 01:51:54.105]  Well, I'll tell you, the Florida Surgeon General, the number one doctor in Florida, says that the COVID shots are not safe.
[01:51:54.185 --> 01:51:55.066]  We need more information.
[01:51:55.086 --> 01:51:57.147]  He says they're infected with DNA.
[01:51:57.827 --> 01:51:59.608]  He says quite a bit, and he does say that.
[01:51:59.628 --> 01:52:03.950]  Why don't you explain to people briefly why you don't want DNA mixed in with a vaccine?
[01:52:04.050 --> 01:52:07.732]  I mean, I'm not a doctor, but I know your body attacks the pathogen.
[01:52:07.992 --> 01:52:09.873]  Anything attached to it, it starts attacking too.
[01:52:10.173 --> 01:52:11.674]  Does that not cause autoimmune disorders?
[01:52:12.966 --> 01:52:24.553]  It actually, it's reported that it's up to 70 times the safety level according to the FDA of DNA contamination in these mod RNA shots.
[01:52:25.634 --> 01:52:27.215]  So explain what that does, doctor.
[01:52:27.235 --> 01:52:28.896]  I know it does a lot.
[01:52:28.996 --> 01:52:37.121]  The concern is, does that DNA in a plasmid get into the cells and actually incorporate DNA code into a person's DNA in their cells?
[01:52:37.799 --> 01:52:40.220]  Possibly to their eggs and sperms.
[01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:41.821]  Which would cause cancer, right?
[01:52:41.881 --> 01:52:43.062]  And we see cancer exploding.
[01:52:43.842 --> 01:52:51.867]  And also the University of Cambridge, that's a prestigious university, said that there's up to 10% of frame-shifting.
[01:52:51.907 --> 01:53:07.257]   That this modified RNA with this synthetic, not man-made, never in nature before, pseudo-uridine that has been put in the mod-RNA shots causes frame shifting is the term they used where there's
[01:53:07.257 --> 01:53:10.877]   misreading of the code when it's going through the ribosome to make proteins and up
[01:53:10.877 --> 01:53:16.478]   to 10% of the time abnormal proteins are made. Abnormal proteins that are not normal cells.
[01:53:16.478 --> 01:53:21.796]   When your body recognizes something that's not self, it'll attack it. If it's attached to your cells,
[01:53:21.796 --> 01:53:23.898]  that will be a problem because it'll attack your cells.
[01:53:24.077 --> 01:53:24.457]  Damn right.
[01:53:24.497 --> 01:53:26.279]  That's autoimmune disorders.
[01:53:26.339 --> 01:53:29.522]  But also, cancers can have... It's a fact.
[01:53:29.682 --> 01:53:34.807]  Cancers have abnormal... So by the way, I don't have a medical degree, but I can figure it out and say, you know, yeah, you're right.
[01:53:35.307 --> 01:53:37.229]  So the system knows exactly what they're doing.
[01:53:37.921 --> 01:53:40.444]  Well, the University of Cambridge published it to the whole world.
[01:53:41.045 --> 01:53:47.712]  It's called Frame Shifting with Modified RNA, making abnormal proteins 10% of the time, which has the potential.
[01:53:47.852 --> 01:53:49.814]  There are abnormal proteins involved in cancers.
[01:53:49.854 --> 01:53:52.758]  Those abnormal proteins could trigger autoimmune disorders.
[01:53:53.218 --> 01:53:54.199]  So that's a fact.
[01:53:54.859 --> 01:54:04.264]  And so you'll have the number one lawyer for the state of Texas, the Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has stood against an onslaught, constantly attacked.
[01:54:04.724 --> 01:54:08.766]  And he says that they have lied about the effectiveness of the COVID shots.
[01:54:08.846 --> 01:54:09.707]  Of course.
[01:54:10.027 --> 01:54:13.969]  And so we heard safe and effective, and they're still saying safe and effective.
[01:54:14.009 --> 01:54:19.831]   But this number one doctor, the Surgeon General of Florida says, Not convinced it's safe.
[01:54:20.672 --> 01:54:23.295]  Four years later, there's evidence that there's a concern that it isn't.
[01:54:23.755 --> 01:54:27.039]  And then you've got the number one lawyer in Texas saying it's not effective.
[01:54:27.099 --> 01:54:28.000]  So, there you go.
[01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:29.081]  That's the whole message.
[01:54:29.181 --> 01:54:29.862]  And you've got a U.S.
[01:54:29.882 --> 01:54:32.224]  Senator saying look out about this lab.
[01:54:32.284 --> 01:54:34.347]  So, they want to make it about Alex Jones.
[01:54:35.583 --> 01:54:38.968]  Instead of making about what the real facts are, folks, don't believe me.
[01:54:39.068 --> 01:54:40.290]  Don't believe Dr. Bartlett.
[01:54:41.091 --> 01:54:42.413]  Just believe your own research.
[01:54:42.513 --> 01:54:43.254]  Do your own research.
[01:54:43.574 --> 01:54:44.976]  Dr. Bartlett, great job.
[01:54:45.337 --> 01:54:46.638]  VDesignWorks.com.
[01:54:46.939 --> 01:54:47.900]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:48.741]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:54:49.502 --> 01:54:49.843]  Thank you.
[01:54:50.646 --> 01:54:56.111]  All right, we have a special guest joining us, Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Pete Chambers.
[01:54:56.211 --> 01:54:59.914]  Great guy, and he lives right outside Austin-Dripping Springs.
[01:54:59.954 --> 01:55:03.096]  He's part of the big convoy operation that's about to launch.
[01:55:03.437 --> 01:55:05.959]  He's going to be joining us coming up when we start the next hour.
[01:55:06.319 --> 01:55:07.040]  Here's a few minutes.

[01:55:50.977 --> 01:55:51.817]  Hour number three!
[01:55:52.884 --> 01:56:01.173]  Hey, Europe's had its convoys, Canada's had its convoys, now America is about to have its convoys, and one of their leaders joins us in studio.
[01:56:01.333 --> 01:56:02.815]  Hey, I got some good news for everybody.

[01:57:04.417 --> 01:57:06.417]  So we have Eamon right there.
[01:57:06.417 --> 01:57:08.417]  This is Neil.

[01:57:10.417 --> 01:57:16.417]  This is an emergency transmit.
[01:57:16.417 --> 01:57:19.417]  From FEMA Region 6 in occupied North America.
[01:57:19.417 --> 01:57:26.417]  There is a war.
[01:57:27.010 --> 01:57:27.991]  It's happening now.
[01:57:28.891 --> 01:57:30.693]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[01:57:31.253 --> 01:57:33.015]  The time to choose sides has come.
[01:57:33.816 --> 01:57:35.297]  We are the resistance.
[01:57:35.556 --> 01:57:37.556]  We are the InfoWar.
[01:57:37.556 --> 01:57:58.556]  [Music]
[01:57:58.556 --> 01:58:04.556]   I'm watching the midterms, then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[01:58:04.579 --> 01:58:08.280]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[01:58:12.242 --> 01:58:14.082]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[01:58:14.442 --> 01:58:18.664]  You voted Trump!
[01:58:20.404 --> 01:58:24.626]  You voted Trump!
[01:58:24.746 --> 01:58:25.306]  Yeah!
[01:58:25.366 --> 01:58:27.067]  Who are you?
[01:58:27.527 --> 01:58:28.267]  You're the president.
[01:58:30.219 --> 01:58:40.219]  boys Muslims.
[01:58:40.219 --> 01:58:54.219]   And you would think everybody in the country is just like to the bunker.
[01:58:54.219 --> 01:58:59.219]  [inaudible]
[01:58:59.219 --> 01:59:04.219]  hello Americans. I'm Paul Harvey.
[01:59:04.232 --> 01:59:06.075]  If I were the devil.
[01:59:07.076 --> 01:59:10.700]  If I were the prince of darkness, I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness.
[01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:17.828]  And I'd have a third of its real estate and four-fifths of its population, but I wouldn't be happy until I had seized the ripest apple on the tree.
[01:59:17.848 --> 01:59:19.169]  Thee.
[01:59:20.729 --> 01:59:23.791]  So I've set about however necessary to take over the United States.
[01:59:23.851 --> 01:59:27.553]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[01:59:27.673 --> 01:59:29.054]  I'd subvert the churches first.
[01:59:29.114 --> 01:59:30.795]  I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[01:59:31.255 --> 01:59:34.657]  With the wisdom of a serpent, I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve.
[01:59:34.937 --> 01:59:35.617]  Do as you please.
[01:59:36.098 --> 01:59:38.219]  To the young, I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[01:59:38.659 --> 01:59:42.161]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[01:59:42.541 --> 01:59:46.063]  I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square.
[01:59:46.083 --> 01:59:48.825]  And the old, I would teach to pray after me.
[01:59:49.745 --> 01:59:52.068]  Our father, witch art in Washington.
[01:59:52.969 --> 01:59:54.110]  And then I'd get organized.
[01:59:54.210 --> 02:00:00.197]  I'd educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting.
[02:00:00.257 --> 02:00:03.380]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[02:00:03.681 --> 02:00:05.383]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[02:00:05.423 --> 02:00:08.446]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[02:00:08.746 --> 02:00:10.588]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[02:00:12.228 --> 02:00:22.737]  If I were the devil, I'd soon have families at war with themselves, churches at war with themselves, and nations at war with themselves, until each in its turn was consumed.
[02:00:22.757 --> 02:00:28.102]  And with promises of higher ratings, I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the flames.
[02:00:28.142 --> 02:00:31.785]  The President of the United States is racist.
[02:00:31.825 --> 02:00:38.612]   If I were the devil, I would encourage schools to refine young intellects, but neglect the Discipline emotions just let those run wild.
[02:00:38.632 --> 02:00:43.719]  Within a decade, I'd have prisons overflowing, I'd have judges promoting pornography.
[02:00:43.779 --> 02:00:49.106]  Soon I could evict God from the courthouse, then from the schoolhouse, and then from the houses of Congress.
[02:00:49.526 --> 02:00:52.610]  And in his own churches, I would substitute psychology for religion.
[02:00:54.618 --> 02:01:07.249]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money if I were the devil I'd take from those who have and give to those who wanted until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[02:01:08.890 --> 02:01:10.652]  I would caution against extremes.
[02:01:10.712 --> 02:01:12.994]  I'm here to warn people, you keep telling me to shut up!
[02:01:13.274 --> 02:01:14.155]  This isn't a game!
[02:01:14.375 --> 02:01:17.678]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct.
[02:01:18.386 --> 02:01:25.193]  I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned, that swinging is more fun, that what you see on TV is the way to be.
[02:01:25.914 --> 02:01:34.322]  And thus I could undress you in public, and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure.
[02:01:34.202 --> 02:01:37.561]   In other words, if I were the devil, I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[02:02:01.641 --> 02:02:07.881]   Well, it's been over a year since he was with us last, and I'm like, wow, why I've not gotten this guy on?
[02:02:07.691 --> 02:02:14.717]  I'm like, reading the news, he's got, he's organizing with a bunch of other folks, multiple convoys going to different parts of the U.S.
[02:02:14.757 --> 02:02:16.819]  border, Texas, Arizona, you name it.
[02:02:16.859 --> 02:02:24.145]  Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Pete Chambers, I'm gonna read his whole bio, he doesn't even want me to, but he joined the Army in 83 and served for a career spanning 39 years.
[02:02:24.585 --> 02:02:29.950]  After his first honorable discharge, he had a break in service, complete college and medical school, University of New England.
[02:02:30.430 --> 02:02:39.133]  He completed a primary care residency and worked as an emergency room physician and commissioned as a peace officer serving the community as a SWAT team physician and sheriff's deputy.
[02:02:39.153 --> 02:02:41.874]  After the United States was attacked on 9-11, he returned to the U.S.
[02:02:41.934 --> 02:02:43.255]  Army Special Forces.
[02:02:43.615 --> 02:02:56.659]  He graduated with a special forces qualification course in the Green Beret and was multiple combat tours during the capacity of the special operations flight surgeon Green Beret commander conducting foreign internal defense missions around the globe.
[02:02:57.119 --> 02:03:14.378]   He lost two State side deployments in Texas, or his last two state deployments in Texas, were a liaison to Governor Greg Abbott's task force during Texas COVID response 2020 and response to the border on South Texas and Operation Lone Star and Task Force Surgeon 2021.
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:20.942]  He's been awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star Medal, Notorious Service Medical and Combat Medical Badge.
[02:03:21.222 --> 02:03:32.547]  Until recently, he has remained off the stage and the grid until he was revealed by Senator Ron Johnson as the whistleblower exposing facts related to the Defense Department's epidemiology database.
[02:03:32.928 --> 02:03:35.889]  He then joined forces with frontline doctors to provide fidelity.
[02:03:36.288 --> 02:03:40.088]   and safety issues regarding both civilian and military aviation safety.
[02:03:40.088 --> 02:03:46.088]   He testified as a fact witness in the Liberty Council SEALS v. DOD case and has traveled
[02:03:46.088 --> 02:03:49.408]   the nation speaking on medical freedom and national defense issues.
[02:03:49.408 --> 02:03:55.327]   2023, he stood up for Republic of Texas Remnant Aid Team and Ministry with focus on community
[02:03:55.327 --> 02:04:01.487]   service, border issues, state of Texas security issues with a heavy emphasis on human toil,
[02:04:01.487 --> 02:04:06.487]   and his team has advised local and state law enforcement and community organizations to
[02:04:06.487 --> 02:04:12.929]   strengthen ties and resolve to organize effectively community response, disaster, natural or man-made.
[02:04:12.929 --> 02:04:19.288]   His team motto is "Ever stalwart, Dr. Pete Chambers dot com and on X at Doc Pete Chambers."
[02:04:19.288 --> 02:04:21.448]  Great to have you and your dog and your crew back with us.
[02:04:21.448 --> 02:04:24.688]   I'm going to skip the next break or so, try to give you the floor.
[02:04:25.008 --> 02:04:31.309]  The convoy is great, but your covert work on the border is incredible both for the government and for the state now individually.
[02:04:31.629 --> 02:04:32.509]  So start wherever you want.
[02:04:32.529 --> 02:04:33.050]  Great to have you back.
[02:04:33.410 --> 02:04:33.550]  Right.
[02:04:33.570 --> 02:04:34.170]  Good to be back.
[02:04:34.190 --> 02:04:47.793]  So essentially what we're doing is with my team specifically, the Remnant A team, this is a ministry and this is a humanitarian effort, but you have to understand this, that sometimes there's evil and sometimes men have to stand in the gap.
[02:04:48.593 --> 02:04:57.280]  And part of the reason that we're here was a response to a tweet which was done to foster courage, I believe.
[02:04:57.641 --> 02:04:58.942]  I believe that's what that tweet was about.
[02:04:59.362 --> 02:05:02.405]  And it was from our, I don't know him, but Tucker Carlson.
[02:05:02.445 --> 02:05:05.788]  I responded, let's get on a horse and come down here and I'll show you what we're doing on the border.
[02:05:06.168 --> 02:05:07.189]  Texas is responding.
[02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:10.872]  Sometimes we keep that clandestine, if you will, not necessarily covert.
[02:05:11.392 --> 02:05:18.414]  But in that, the ministry has grown, and we are providing comfort to those that need it, the local citizens.
[02:05:18.814 --> 02:05:21.815]  We are providing ministry in the form of revival.
[02:05:22.275 --> 02:05:23.375]  This is the largest revival.
[02:05:23.435 --> 02:05:25.496]  You're organizing Americans during the invasion?
[02:05:26.256 --> 02:05:26.836]  Absolutely.
[02:05:27.396 --> 02:05:28.296]  This isn't an invasion.
[02:05:28.456 --> 02:05:28.977]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:05:29.657 --> 02:05:34.158]  We briefed Governor Abbott two years ago on the invasion that was taking place on the border.
[02:05:34.298 --> 02:05:34.638]  My team.
[02:05:35.419 --> 02:05:36.320]  When I was in uniform.
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:39.341]  When I came here and spoke to you, that was after the reveal of the DMED.
[02:05:39.861 --> 02:05:42.122]  And I went to Persona Non Grata after that.
[02:05:42.983 --> 02:05:43.303]  I bet.
[02:05:43.423 --> 02:05:43.803]  Yeah, right?
[02:05:43.923 --> 02:05:46.465]  And by the way, Abbott's not perfect, but he's getting more hardcore.
[02:05:46.865 --> 02:05:49.846]  They ordered him two days ago to pull off the state guard.
[02:05:50.146 --> 02:05:51.867]  He doubled down more barbed wire.
[02:05:52.187 --> 02:05:52.588]  Absolutely.
[02:05:52.628 --> 02:05:59.211]  So what's happening there, from the ground, two days ago I was there, the National Guard, the state of Texas, is holding their own.
[02:05:59.691 --> 02:06:06.015]   However, however, The Supreme Court is going against what the Constitution says.
[02:06:06.475 --> 02:06:07.676]  The Constitution is law.
[02:06:08.156 --> 02:06:17.902]  They're using tort law to argue Hegelian dialectics to make their way, snake their way through to say, well, you know, it's not safe for the migrants.
[02:06:18.632 --> 02:06:20.613]  Well, there's people drowning on that river all the time.
[02:06:20.633 --> 02:06:21.613]  My guys have responded to it.
[02:06:21.813 --> 02:06:25.194]  We lost a soldier at Eagle Pass because he tried to rescue somebody down there.
[02:06:25.534 --> 02:06:26.814]  So don't tell me that it's that.
[02:06:27.014 --> 02:06:31.436]  Are you arguing public safety to accelerate the crisis that created the public safety problem?
[02:06:31.776 --> 02:06:36.457]  Which is Hegelian in nature, because we're focusing on that and not the actual Constitution, which is the law.
[02:06:37.037 --> 02:06:38.678]  The Constitution is what we go by.
[02:06:39.078 --> 02:06:41.279]  And you know how I know that the government agrees with me?
[02:06:41.399 --> 02:06:42.959]  Because they took the same oath that I did.
[02:06:43.759 --> 02:06:46.792]   And when they take that same oath that I took, They agree with me.
[02:06:46.852 --> 02:06:49.693]  But now if they don't do it in an invasion, that's treason.
[02:06:50.734 --> 02:06:51.334]  Please continue.
[02:06:51.514 --> 02:06:51.674]  Yeah.
[02:06:52.114 --> 02:06:55.096]  So what we have here is a failure to communicate.
[02:06:55.276 --> 02:06:59.457]  An old line from a movie, Cool Hand Luke, to communicate the truth.
[02:06:59.617 --> 02:07:00.758]  And what this is, is simple.
[02:07:01.178 --> 02:07:07.127]   This convoy, everything that we're doing, we the people, This remnant nation that is rising up.
[02:07:07.407 --> 02:07:08.088]  It is rising up.
[02:07:08.128 --> 02:07:08.748]  You can feel it.
[02:07:09.708 --> 02:07:10.109]  You can.
[02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:11.949]  And you're out there force multiplying.
[02:07:12.970 --> 02:07:13.890]  That's what Green Berets do.
[02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:16.171]  Foreign internal defense is our bread and butter.
[02:07:16.291 --> 02:07:17.812]  Unconventional warfare is our bread and butter.
[02:07:18.132 --> 02:07:19.973]  Now we're doing domestic internal defense.
[02:07:20.253 --> 02:07:21.995]  Look on my website, you'll see it in the lines of effort.
[02:07:22.896 --> 02:07:25.979]  We never dreamt that we would be doing domestic internal defense.
[02:07:26.439 --> 02:07:27.260]  This is what we're doing.
[02:07:27.561 --> 02:07:28.762]  Legally, morally, and ethically.
[02:07:28.802 --> 02:07:30.704]  But there is a factor here.
[02:07:31.044 --> 02:07:37.671]  And the factor is for us, what gets us to the enemy quickly, is to find, fix, and finish, exploit, analyze, and disseminate.
[02:07:37.791 --> 02:07:39.153]  F3EAD, that's a model.
[02:07:39.373 --> 02:07:42.336]  That's what we did in Syria when we took out ISIS.
[02:07:42.416 --> 02:07:42.897]  Really quick.
[02:07:43.537 --> 02:07:45.837]  Now we can't, we don't have the authorities to finish.
[02:07:46.258 --> 02:07:47.978]  So what we do, we find and fix.
[02:07:48.018 --> 02:07:49.718]  We fix the location of where the bad guys are.
[02:07:50.118 --> 02:07:59.740]  We look, we pair up with law enforcement who is constitutionally sound, because there are those down on the border, I hate to say this, this is the truth, that are not constitutionally sound.
[02:07:59.760 --> 02:08:00.280]  Compromised.
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:01.100]  Compromised.
[02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:02.180]  Absolutely.
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.641]  Without getting into any of the secret stuff.
[02:08:04.941 --> 02:08:05.541]  No, no sir.
[02:08:05.561 --> 02:08:07.901]  You've been there federally and state, but now you're down there as a citizen.
[02:08:07.921 --> 02:08:09.242]  You're doing incredible work.
[02:08:09.382 --> 02:08:11.822]  What is your report from the border before we get into the convoy?
[02:08:12.142 --> 02:08:16.004]  Okay, so from the border itself, you have complete mayhem.
[02:08:16.044 --> 02:08:18.225]  There's an old word from World War II called FUBAR.
[02:08:18.705 --> 02:08:22.347]  And what that's doing is overwhelming the system, and the system is broken.
[02:08:22.867 --> 02:08:29.730]  And we care about people, we do, but they're being used as pawns on that border in a larger chessboard at the world level.
[02:08:30.231 --> 02:08:36.574]  And the globalists will continue to use these people to do more than just cloward-pivin doctrine stuff.
[02:08:36.834 --> 02:08:37.694]  Way more than that.
[02:08:38.094 --> 02:08:39.355]  This is to destabilize.
[02:08:39.715 --> 02:08:41.056]  This is Beslanov stuff.
[02:08:41.556 --> 02:08:44.257]  This is, we're going to take over your country from within.
[02:08:44.597 --> 02:08:44.877]  Stuff.
[02:08:45.257 --> 02:08:51.520]  And when you add the CCP to that little salt shaker, in the form of a chemical warfare called fentanyl, that's laced with tranq?
[02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:53.160]  Alright, that's a horse tranquilizer?
[02:08:53.420 --> 02:08:54.501]  Why are people dying so much?
[02:08:54.521 --> 02:08:54.881]  130,000 in 2022?
[02:08:54.921 --> 02:08:55.401]  That's chemical warfare.
[02:08:58.342 --> 02:09:00.284]  So it's the opium wars in reverse.
[02:09:00.544 --> 02:09:01.505]  It's exactly what they did.
[02:09:01.525 --> 02:09:03.628]  There were two versions of that.
[02:09:03.908 --> 02:09:05.330]  1839 and 1850 something.
[02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:07.272]  France and England did it to China.
[02:09:07.312 --> 02:09:08.173]  That's how they conquered China.
[02:09:08.453 --> 02:09:09.274]  That's exactly what they did.
[02:09:09.294 --> 02:09:10.055]  They demoralized them.
[02:09:10.375 --> 02:09:12.017]  They got their trade routes that they wanted.
[02:09:12.057 --> 02:09:13.318]  That's what the purpose of that was.
[02:09:13.638 --> 02:09:16.682]  Now China's using that same method to come back and hit us.
[02:09:17.342 --> 02:09:17.822]  It's warfare.
[02:09:18.002 --> 02:09:19.103]  Keep going, Dr. It's warfare.
[02:09:19.503 --> 02:09:21.243]  So, there are multiple lines of effort.
[02:09:21.483 --> 02:09:25.664]  So, the lines of effort, when I talk about that, that's a different level.
[02:09:25.724 --> 02:09:28.945]  Strategic level lines of effort, operational, and tactical.
[02:09:29.025 --> 02:09:31.586]  At the tactical level on the board right now, we're overwhelmed.
[02:09:32.186 --> 02:09:35.687]  At, specifically, Eagle Pass, Texas is standing up for what is right.
[02:09:35.887 --> 02:09:38.448]  Article 4, Section 4, constitutional stuff.
[02:09:38.908 --> 02:09:40.648]  Also, the state of Texas Constitution.
[02:09:40.928 --> 02:09:43.389]  When we focus there, we uphold the Constitution.
[02:09:43.869 --> 02:09:45.389]  We're trying to do that.
[02:09:45.529 --> 02:09:46.290]  When A.G.
[02:09:46.330 --> 02:10:03.414]  Paxton says, Texas will not surrender, he's taking a quote out of this right here, the letter, that today, well, in February, is the anniversary of the Travis letter from inside the Alamo when he says, come to our aid with all dispatch, and he ends with victory or death.
[02:10:03.614 --> 02:10:04.174]  Absolutely right.
[02:10:04.474 --> 02:10:05.474]  That's where we sit now.
[02:10:06.134 --> 02:10:08.295]  I wrote my own version of it, and I'm going to post this thing.
[02:10:08.855 --> 02:10:09.296]  Want me to read it?
[02:10:09.456 --> 02:10:10.036]  You got the floor, brother.
[02:10:10.056 --> 02:10:10.517]  Absolutely.
[02:10:10.937 --> 02:10:12.699]  My letter to Texans and all Americans.
[02:10:13.079 --> 02:10:14.781]  With credit to William Barrett Travis.
[02:10:15.021 --> 02:10:19.646]  Letter of 24 February 1836 from the Commandancy of the Alamo.
[02:10:20.346 --> 02:10:23.770]  Fellow citizen compatriots, realize I'm paraphrasing him.
[02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:35.042]  But for this time such as this, this Esther moment, we are besieged on all sides by forces of evil and those who have chosen not to uphold their oaths swore to protect both the Texas and the U.S.
[02:10:35.062 --> 02:10:35.803]  Constitutions.
[02:10:36.244 --> 02:10:44.032]  We have sustained a continual bombardment, continually, upon our inalienable rights and freedoms and have lost many souls.
[02:10:44.853 --> 02:10:47.854]  The enemy has demanded a surrender of our rights.
[02:10:48.274 --> 02:10:54.016]  Should we falter, the honor, prestige, and esprit de corps of the nation shall wane in the balance.
[02:10:54.136 --> 02:11:05.601]  If this defense is pushed beyond our capacity, we will answer accordingly, legally, morally, ethically, and our flags will still fly proudly from the walls.
[02:11:06.281 --> 02:11:07.221]  But we're in a fight, folks.
[02:11:07.742 --> 02:11:09.862]  We shall never surrender or retreat.
[02:11:10.102 --> 02:11:13.500]   Then I call on you in the name of liberty, And it's the official UN plan.
[02:11:13.540 --> 02:11:14.381]  They already destroyed Europe.
[02:11:14.201 --> 02:11:19.320]   to the American character to come to our aid with all dispatch.
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:26.001]   If this call is neglected, we are determined to sustain ourselves as long as possible for
[02:11:26.001 --> 02:11:29.480]  what is due to our honor and that of our country.
[02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:30.480]  Victory or death.
[02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:35.201]  Lieutenant Colonel retired Peter Constantine Chambers.
[02:11:35.201 --> 02:11:36.201]  Let that sink in.
[02:11:36.201 --> 02:11:38.761]  And it's the official UN plan.
[02:11:38.761 --> 02:11:39.961]  They already destroyed Europe.
[02:11:39.961 --> 02:11:40.961]  It's happening now.
[02:11:40.961 --> 02:11:41.841]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:41.841 --> 02:11:43.825]   *sips tea* Keep going, doctor.
[02:11:44.326 --> 02:11:46.167]  This is, uh, you know... Epic stuff.
[02:11:46.287 --> 02:11:53.971]  You know what war looks like when you've lived at war for the past 20 years and then you watch it shut down in about two weeks and you end up giving billions of dollars of weaponry to your enemy.
[02:11:54.391 --> 02:11:55.512]  We know what war looks like.
[02:11:55.772 --> 02:11:57.673]  There is a moral injury in this nation.
[02:11:58.013 --> 02:12:05.860]   On January the 1st, 2024, At 0400 hours, a declaration of military accountability was released.
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:08.061]  231 signatories wrote that letter.
[02:12:08.381 --> 02:12:10.201]  Some still in uniform.
[02:12:10.221 --> 02:12:13.343]  This is a call to aid with all dispatch.
[02:12:13.383 --> 02:12:14.843]  Militaryaccountability.com.
[02:12:14.883 --> 02:12:15.743]  Go sign the petition.
[02:12:16.004 --> 02:12:19.645]  We need to get our legislators to either do their job or get them out.
[02:12:19.665 --> 02:12:20.605]  So I want to look at the border.
[02:12:20.625 --> 02:12:21.966]  I want to look at the convoys coming up.
[02:12:21.986 --> 02:12:23.046]  They got a lot of attention.
[02:12:23.066 --> 02:12:24.167]  They tried to ignore the last ones.
[02:12:25.108 --> 02:12:28.414]  But just, you're a great guy, huge history, military, Green Beret commander.
[02:12:28.775 --> 02:12:32.963]  How would you describe where America is right now, what the people can do, this moment in history?
[02:12:33.564 --> 02:12:35.986]  What you can do this moment in history is you're going to have to get active.
[02:12:36.026 --> 02:12:41.770]  This country is, this is not, this is not the cognitive dissonance thing that people talk about.
[02:12:41.790 --> 02:12:43.491]  That's minimizing this problem.
[02:12:43.811 --> 02:12:47.213]  You are a prisoner of war right now, and this is called Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:12:47.493 --> 02:12:48.734]  How do we get out of Stockholm Syndrome?
[02:12:48.754 --> 02:12:53.938]  I'm going to tell you, because as a guy that understands SERE, survival, evasion, resistance, and escape, it's the little victories.
[02:12:54.258 --> 02:12:55.219]  It's this convoy.
[02:12:55.539 --> 02:12:58.201]  It's my preacher friend who's down there talking to people.
[02:12:59.061 --> 02:13:02.603]  Not one thing he does saves us, but it's the resistance does.
[02:13:02.843 --> 02:13:05.704]  Because we either die by a death of a thousand cuts or we live by it.
[02:13:06.065 --> 02:13:06.545]  Exactly.
[02:13:06.985 --> 02:13:07.685]  Explain that though.
[02:13:07.745 --> 02:13:08.706]  Resistance is victory.
[02:13:09.106 --> 02:13:10.106]  Resistance is victory.
[02:13:10.367 --> 02:13:13.128]  It is the motto of my last unit.
[02:13:13.228 --> 02:13:14.288]  I was noose defiance.
[02:13:14.609 --> 02:13:15.269]  We defy.
[02:13:16.047 --> 02:13:18.469]  Now, whether that's peacefully or any other way, that's what we do.
[02:13:18.509 --> 02:13:19.369]  We defy tyranny.
[02:13:19.749 --> 02:13:23.071]  And so for us, who live on that wall, you need us on that wall.
[02:13:23.652 --> 02:13:26.033]  For us, the stake is a little bit higher.
[02:13:26.073 --> 02:13:28.615]  For those people that make those signatures, it's a little bit higher.
[02:13:28.995 --> 02:13:31.076]  To be thrown in the brig, it's a little bit higher.
[02:13:31.336 --> 02:13:33.638]  For me as a whistleblower, a little bit higher.
[02:13:33.678 --> 02:13:34.198]  But you know what?
[02:13:34.498 --> 02:13:37.861]  Every one of those consequences for those actions are well worth it.
[02:13:38.121 --> 02:13:41.303]  Because my Lord and Creator tells me that the truth shall set you free.
[02:13:41.683 --> 02:13:44.865]  If we all stood down and rolled over to the globalists, where would they take us?
[02:13:46.826 --> 02:13:47.628]  Completely to hell.
[02:13:49.613 --> 02:13:50.795]  That's what it'll look like on our streets.
[02:13:50.835 --> 02:13:56.969]  I've seen 53 countries in my life, and I've seen places where people don't have food, water, where they haul water and chop wood.
[02:13:57.785 --> 02:13:58.425]  To survive.
[02:13:58.485 --> 02:13:59.186]  And that's what the U.N.
[02:13:59.206 --> 02:13:59.866]  will do if they let them.
[02:14:00.306 --> 02:14:01.107]  That's exactly what they'll do.
[02:14:01.127 --> 02:14:02.147]  Everybody's like, oh, we'll fight the U.N.
[02:14:02.167 --> 02:14:02.627]  when they come here.
[02:14:02.647 --> 02:14:05.029]  They're coming with the NGOs, the bureaucracy.
[02:14:05.109 --> 02:14:05.489]  It's here.
[02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:07.610]  And their focus is to do that from within.
[02:14:07.670 --> 02:14:11.812]  So they're trying to set us up upon each other as a civil war.
[02:14:11.852 --> 02:14:15.574]  They want Bubba to be poked in the eye enough times to set off a civil war.
[02:14:16.374 --> 02:14:34.708]   After the Obama administration, this is from my personal objective, as perception is reality, After that, this country started splitting in its races, in its neighborhoods, in its very being of the thing that we fought for for so many years and bled for and died for.
[02:14:34.728 --> 02:14:37.891]  This guy on my wrist took his life right next to me.
[02:14:37.911 --> 02:14:38.631]  They took his life.
[02:14:39.192 --> 02:14:40.873]  And I went to his mom and you know what she told me?
[02:14:41.194 --> 02:14:42.715]  Live your life like his life mattered.
[02:14:44.420 --> 02:14:44.600]  Right?
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:45.921]  These are real things.
[02:14:45.941 --> 02:14:47.822]  There are real consequences of these actions.
[02:14:48.142 --> 02:14:53.624]  So when we're talking about this stuff and this convoy, those people, God bless them, they're leaving out of Virginia right now.
[02:14:53.644 --> 02:14:54.204]  They're on their way.
[02:14:54.224 --> 02:14:55.425]  They're coming through Dripping Springs.
[02:14:55.685 --> 02:14:56.385]  We're going to hook up there.
[02:14:56.405 --> 02:14:57.826]  We're going to take it to Eagle Pass.
[02:14:58.126 --> 02:14:59.887]  We've got sheriffs down there that are on our side.
[02:15:00.147 --> 02:15:02.068]  We've got sheriffs down there that are not on our side.
[02:15:02.088 --> 02:15:03.249]  We're going to talk about the convoy.
[02:15:03.629 --> 02:15:05.790]  Get that however you want, but big picture.
[02:15:06.690 --> 02:15:07.971]  America's in a fight for it.
[02:15:08.371 --> 02:15:09.572]  This is the globalist invasion.
[02:15:10.152 --> 02:15:11.954]  They've been setting up for decades.
[02:15:12.254 --> 02:15:12.814]  This is it.
[02:15:12.914 --> 02:15:13.595]  Beta's over.
[02:15:13.955 --> 02:15:14.736]  This is the assault.
[02:15:15.936 --> 02:15:17.237]  This is the mainline effort, okay?
[02:15:17.257 --> 02:15:19.739]  So you have to understand, in combat, there is a mainline effort.
[02:15:19.759 --> 02:15:21.120]  And you've got to be able to see that thing.
[02:15:21.220 --> 02:15:24.062]  Because there's this thing called the bang, which is the IED in the road.
[02:15:24.642 --> 02:15:32.888]  When you are left a bang, and you see it coming, people like you, people like me, who've seen these things, whether in combat or not, you've seen these things, and you go, it's coming.
[02:15:34.141 --> 02:15:35.322]  You want to wait until it blows up?
[02:15:35.742 --> 02:15:36.563]  Then you're right-of-bang.
[02:15:36.623 --> 02:15:37.583]  Now you're reacting to it.
[02:15:38.344 --> 02:15:39.085]  That's how we win.
[02:15:39.465 --> 02:15:46.290]  We get left-of-bang on this thing, and we start getting our heads on right, and by little victories, civilians... Explain this.
[02:15:46.330 --> 02:15:48.631]  The first we admit we're in a war, and then what do we do?
[02:15:48.651 --> 02:15:51.313]  Okay, so you develop the information preparation of the battlefield.
[02:15:51.693 --> 02:15:54.736]  You identify who the enemy is, and who the friendlies are.
[02:15:55.236 --> 02:15:57.237]  Now sometimes, you've got to work with enemies.
[02:15:57.338 --> 02:16:01.260]  I've had to talk to Taliban warlords and get something done on the Pakistan border.
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:01.981]  I've had to do that.
[02:16:02.501 --> 02:16:06.385]  But you understand that your ultimate end state is your commander's intent.
[02:16:06.905 --> 02:16:09.208]  So now, the commander's intent in this is freedom.
[02:16:09.588 --> 02:16:10.269]  It's sovereignty.
[02:16:10.649 --> 02:16:14.352]  It is the state of Texas rising so that Texas will not fall.
[02:16:14.713 --> 02:16:17.155]  Because the first domino of the flyover states is Texas.
[02:16:17.195 --> 02:16:19.297]  And this alligator is way too close to our canoe.
[02:16:19.477 --> 02:16:20.819]  And this is an assault on Texas?
[02:16:21.199 --> 02:16:25.683]  This is an exact assault on Texas because it is the prize jewel of the globalists.
[02:16:27.024 --> 02:16:27.485]  I believe that.
[02:16:28.078 --> 02:16:28.599]  That's true.
[02:16:28.679 --> 02:16:29.219]  So keep going.
[02:16:29.239 --> 02:16:29.660]  What do we do?
[02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:33.224]  So what we do is we continue with all these different projects that we have.
[02:16:33.244 --> 02:16:36.507]  These multi-pronged efforts because there's a mainline effort.
[02:16:36.567 --> 02:16:37.929]  The mainline effort is sovereignty.
[02:16:38.349 --> 02:16:39.490]  Keep focusing on that.
[02:16:40.071 --> 02:16:47.059]  Then the supporting operations, the things that happen on the side, the little victories, the getting the bad legislator out.
[02:16:47.139 --> 02:16:49.902]  I don't put a lot of faith in the federal level, but in the state level I do.
[02:16:50.482 --> 02:16:52.284]  And I want those legislators in there.
[02:16:52.544 --> 02:16:54.205]  But we also have friends that are going up.
[02:16:54.365 --> 02:16:57.568]  We've got a group of Green Berets and Seals that are going up to run for Congress.
[02:16:57.788 --> 02:16:58.969]  We've got to support those people.
[02:16:59.409 --> 02:16:59.669]  Alright?
[02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:04.012]  I'll put a shout out right now for the Virginia race against Vindman.
[02:17:04.493 --> 02:17:05.173]  Remember that name?
[02:17:05.293 --> 02:17:05.534]  Oh yeah.
[02:17:05.734 --> 02:17:07.775]  Alright, his brother, his twin brother is a Jag.
[02:17:08.196 --> 02:17:13.019]  And I want Cameron Hamilton to know, I want you to search him out in Virginia, and I want you to support that man.
[02:17:13.079 --> 02:17:20.833]   A Seal, a man of honor, a man of God, who is running against a vitriolic Person that came after our whistleblowers and court-martialed
[02:17:20.833 --> 02:17:26.311]   one of our guys. So these are the things so at that level That's where you can affect that okay, because there's a
[02:17:26.311 --> 02:17:29.022]  war literally happening now for America, right?
[02:17:29.022 --> 02:17:33.122]   And so you've got to pay attention to the right people you've got to come to the right place to get the right information
[02:17:33.122 --> 02:17:37.323]   That's why my whole website is a line of effort. It's all it is
[02:17:37.323 --> 02:17:41.163]   It's just look at this and then interact with me and tell me what you see out there
[02:17:41.163 --> 02:17:43.922]   I'm gonna tell you what I see and that's Dr. Pete Chambers calm
[02:17:43.922 --> 02:17:44.922]  DrPJams.com.
[02:17:44.922 --> 02:17:45.922]  Yes, sir.
[02:17:45.922 --> 02:17:48.522]  And that'll lead you to Telegram and to the X and all that.
[02:17:48.563 --> 02:17:57.795]  So you've got the floor here, I really respect you, but should we get into the convoy or should we talk about what you've been seeing working for the state, the feds, all of it now as a private citizen at the border?
[02:17:58.235 --> 02:18:02.160]  Because you've got the NGOs, the UN bases, I mean this is going on, Mayorkas.
[02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:03.680]  Crazy.
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:04.680]  Okay, so we can start.
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:07.439]  Let's just look at the, for the 40,000 foot view in.
[02:18:07.439 --> 02:18:08.439]  We're going to bring it in.
[02:18:08.439 --> 02:18:09.439]  We're going to dial it in.
[02:18:09.439 --> 02:18:12.599]   At the 40,000 foot view, what we're seeing as they come up to the Darien Gap, and you've
[02:18:12.599 --> 02:18:14.359]  talked to Michael Yaun every day.
[02:18:14.359 --> 02:18:15.660]  So Michael is a good friend.
[02:18:15.660 --> 02:18:17.080]  He tells us what's going on.
[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:21.120]   And Michael Yaun is our kind of recon scout out there, if you will.
[02:18:21.245 --> 02:18:22.285]  Former Green Beret himself.
[02:18:22.666 --> 02:18:25.748]  He's downrange and he's looking at stuff and telling us exactly what's happening.
[02:18:26.029 --> 02:18:29.972]  As we get the information up here, our people process it and then we let the locals know.
[02:18:30.072 --> 02:18:35.016]  So when Eagle Pass for example, when that 12,500 came in, I knew they were coming in.
[02:18:35.116 --> 02:18:37.378]  I was sitting on the ground with a team with a drone.
[02:18:37.758 --> 02:18:40.861]  I told my boys on the ground, you got 20 minutes to get that drone up and down.
[02:18:41.241 --> 02:18:46.770]  They didn't have any airspace, uh, any problems with, uh, clearing, uh, conflicting flights, so we did it.
[02:18:47.391 --> 02:18:50.256]  Uh, Highway Patrol showed up and said, hey, you guys can't fly anymore.
[02:18:50.316 --> 02:18:50.576]  Got it.
[02:18:50.677 --> 02:18:51.117]  No problem.
[02:18:51.358 --> 02:18:52.079]  But we got the shot.
[02:18:52.099 --> 02:18:53.742]  12,000 people came in in five hours.
[02:18:55.262 --> 02:18:55.762]  Eagle Pass.
[02:18:56.162 --> 02:19:01.144]  Prior to that, a year and a half ago in Del Rio, 17,000 Haitians showed up over 48 hours.
[02:19:01.384 --> 02:19:02.985]  You know how we knew and we were standing by ready?
[02:19:03.225 --> 02:19:04.405]  Because Michael Yan called us.
[02:19:04.765 --> 02:19:05.645]  That's how this works.
[02:19:05.945 --> 02:19:11.547]  And that's what's beautiful, is we have the natural intel of human people, their patriots there.
[02:19:11.847 --> 02:19:12.828]  People that give a crap.
[02:19:13.628 --> 02:19:14.468]  Just gonna talk plain.
[02:19:14.628 --> 02:19:15.168]  That's what it is.
[02:19:15.268 --> 02:19:20.130]  They give a crap about this nation, about this constitution, because if we don't, what are the results of that?
[02:19:20.550 --> 02:19:21.971]  And the globalists never counted on you.
[02:19:22.711 --> 02:19:22.851]  No.
[02:19:23.945 --> 02:19:24.085]  No.
[02:19:24.505 --> 02:19:25.025]  No, they didn't.
[02:19:25.866 --> 02:19:27.186]  Well, you know, I was a whistleblower.
[02:19:27.206 --> 02:19:28.607]  I didn't have a single thing on the Internet.
[02:19:28.647 --> 02:19:32.589]  Now I'm all over the place on the kind of lower level media.
[02:19:32.969 --> 02:19:35.870]  But I want you to understand this, that this is a labor of love.
[02:19:36.110 --> 02:19:38.931]  I would much rather be on my ranch raising longhorns right now.
[02:19:39.592 --> 02:19:40.052]  But I can't.
[02:19:40.990 --> 02:19:42.131]  I can't, because this is a fight.
[02:19:42.151 --> 02:19:44.332]  We're going to lose it all if we don't.
[02:19:44.872 --> 02:19:46.372]  We're going to lose it all if we don't.
[02:19:46.553 --> 02:19:47.693]  We're at 1774 right now, I believe.
[02:19:48.373 --> 02:19:51.375]  We've got the coercion acts, the stamps acts, and all these things that are coming.
[02:19:51.795 --> 02:19:54.516]  And everything is affecting the battle space of the future right now.
[02:19:54.976 --> 02:19:55.376]  The battle space?
[02:19:55.396 --> 02:19:57.557]  Every little bit of work we do is going to have a huge effect on the future.
[02:19:57.918 --> 02:19:58.458]  Absolutely.
[02:19:59.698 --> 02:20:02.760]  Because the second and third order effects of tyranny are death.
[02:20:03.460 --> 02:20:04.821]  That's just the way it is.
[02:20:05.981 --> 02:20:09.403]  But the second and third order effects of courage, which is contagious.
[02:20:10.424 --> 02:20:12.245]  This convoy, all these things.
[02:20:12.866 --> 02:20:13.246]  No, I agree.
[02:20:13.266 --> 02:20:13.706]  My team.
[02:20:15.127 --> 02:20:15.848]  Courageous people.
[02:20:17.109 --> 02:20:25.655]  I want to go to break, get me into the border and then the convoy and give me the floor when we come back, but I don't want to say we're winning, but the globalists admit they get confronted everywhere.
[02:20:25.675 --> 02:20:30.379]  They talk about, oh, we've got to censor people, we're losing, we don't trust again.
[02:20:30.839 --> 02:20:34.201]  They, I mean, they weren't identified in the last few years.
[02:20:34.522 --> 02:20:35.522]  They're not in a good position.
[02:20:36.443 --> 02:20:37.644]  No, they're on their spurs right now.
[02:20:38.382 --> 02:20:44.610]  They're falling backwards, because we've got a guy in front of them, little people like me, with a sword in the sand, saying, no, not today.
[02:20:44.850 --> 02:20:45.451]  Not in this place.
[02:20:45.531 --> 02:20:45.951]  That's right.
[02:20:46.011 --> 02:20:47.653]  So how would you describe the battlefront?
[02:20:48.294 --> 02:20:49.516]  What's the battle conditions here?
[02:20:49.976 --> 02:20:51.899]  So in battle, there's chaos.
[02:20:51.939 --> 02:20:54.041]  And you can see the pictures there.
[02:20:54.061 --> 02:20:54.602]  I mean, you're seeing it.
[02:20:54.662 --> 02:20:55.082]  It's chaos.
[02:20:55.162 --> 02:20:56.885]  It's complete chaos, and it's meant to overwhelm.
[02:20:58.206 --> 02:21:01.067]  I'm a man of faith, and I believe that God chose Gideon for a reason.
[02:21:01.107 --> 02:21:05.969]  He whittled it down to 300 severely intelligent men that were willing to fight.
[02:21:06.549 --> 02:21:09.950]  Serious men, just like us, who understand battle.
[02:21:10.390 --> 02:21:11.811]  And so this is where we're at.
[02:21:11.931 --> 02:21:22.115]  And so, I can't go into the details of it, nor should I, but just understand, Texas, that there are people standing in line right now who are paired up with local law enforcement, who are helping out.
[02:21:25.138 --> 02:21:25.679]  What do you call them?
[02:21:25.719 --> 02:21:26.921]  The convoy folks.
[02:21:27.322 --> 02:21:31.308]  Look, the mamas that are out there saying, hey, look, we're sick and tired of this.
[02:21:31.368 --> 02:21:32.129]  We're going to ride along.
[02:21:32.149 --> 02:21:34.713]  I mean, you got mamas sitting up in semis coming out here.
[02:21:36.482 --> 02:21:37.022]  That's a risk.
[02:21:37.743 --> 02:21:39.624]  That's a semi-permissive environment on that border.
[02:21:39.884 --> 02:21:40.285]  That's right.
[02:21:40.465 --> 02:21:42.326]  All the way up to Fowl Furious, as far as I can tell.
[02:21:42.466 --> 02:21:48.450]  But it's so obvious, not just this convoy, if millions of people peacefully went to the Texas border now, it'd be over.
[02:21:48.790 --> 02:21:49.251]  It would be over.
[02:21:49.851 --> 02:21:51.492]  But people have got to get off their ass.
[02:21:51.632 --> 02:21:53.414]  We need 100 million people to get off their ass.
[02:21:55.755 --> 02:21:55.915]  Yeah.
[02:21:55.935 --> 02:21:59.878]  The good news is we've got a lot of people like Joe Rogan to start talking about this, but they're still not calling for action.
[02:22:00.518 --> 02:22:01.339]  I respect that man.
[02:22:01.479 --> 02:22:02.460]  He's not calling for action.
[02:22:02.800 --> 02:22:03.100]  He will.
[02:22:03.200 --> 02:22:04.721]  He's going to see the courage and he's going to step up.
[02:22:04.761 --> 02:22:05.702]  He knows how to fight.
[02:22:06.468 --> 02:22:07.070]  He knows how to fight.
[02:22:07.392 --> 02:22:08.094]  And he will.
[02:22:08.134 --> 02:22:08.696]  He'll step up.
[02:22:08.897 --> 02:22:09.740]  I pray for him every day.
[02:22:11.105 --> 02:22:11.346]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:12.660 --> 02:22:13.740]  He was just texting me earlier.
[02:22:14.241 --> 02:22:15.241]  He's come a long way.
[02:22:15.281 --> 02:22:16.041]  People can't get mad at me.
[02:22:16.061 --> 02:22:21.543]  I haven't gone all the way yet, but I think it's going to be people like him that finally wake up and he's starting to do it, that it's going to be game over.
[02:22:21.823 --> 02:22:22.184]  Roger that.
[02:22:22.544 --> 02:22:23.464]  Yeah, I believe that.
[02:22:23.764 --> 02:22:25.345]  We're going to break in about two and a half minutes.
[02:22:25.605 --> 02:22:26.985]  What are we going to cover when we come back, doctor?
[02:22:27.486 --> 02:22:28.766]  We'll cover the convoy.
[02:22:28.806 --> 02:22:33.408]  I'd like to get in a little details of that just to help those folks out because this is the project that I'm on now.
[02:22:33.428 --> 02:22:39.390]  This is my 50 meter target, but then we can go into a little bit about what I believe this future is going to look like for us.
[02:22:40.540 --> 02:22:41.861]  Absolutely, we've got a few minutes until break.
[02:22:41.961 --> 02:22:48.445]  So, there's an article on InfoWorks.com about Jimmy White, take our border back, Americans announce multi-state convoy to descend on southern border.
[02:22:48.805 --> 02:22:50.286]  Spend a few minutes about what's happening.
[02:22:50.306 --> 02:22:51.647]  There's a bunch of different convoys.
[02:22:51.827 --> 02:22:54.849]  Right, so there's three different locations that they're going to end up in.
[02:22:55.029 --> 02:22:56.370]  San Ysidro, California.
[02:22:56.750 --> 02:22:57.531]  Yuma, Arizona.
[02:22:57.751 --> 02:22:59.572]  I'm just the facilitator for the Texas bunch.
[02:22:59.972 --> 02:23:06.755]  We're going to end up, they're in route, they will be coming here from Virginia and they will come through down directly south.
[02:23:06.995 --> 02:23:09.217]  I don't know their exact highways, probably Highway 10.
[02:23:09.577 --> 02:23:16.460]  They'll end up in Dripping Springs and then from there we'll take the back roads down to a little town called Quimado, Texas.
[02:23:16.760 --> 02:23:17.721]  It's going to be on the website.
[02:23:17.761 --> 02:23:19.502]  There will be a location where they'll link up down there.
[02:23:19.782 --> 02:23:22.563]  There will be a revival going on at the same time, which is awesome.
[02:23:22.883 --> 02:23:26.145]  But it's going to bring, it's going to shed light to this situation.
[02:23:26.224 --> 02:23:29.824]  To the to the dangers posed by a wide open southern border.
[02:23:29.824 --> 02:23:33.014]   That's the whole purpose Let's be clear people say oh this won't save the world. No,
[02:23:33.014 --> 02:23:35.583]   it's the little victories. It's a little victories collectively
[02:23:35.583 --> 02:23:41.354]   Yeah, we've got people used to the victories. It's like exercise. It's you get in right think of the energy that
[02:23:41.354 --> 02:23:44.263]   happens when these people Get back home start talking and then the next one that's
[02:23:44.263 --> 02:23:46.083]   gonna come in the next one that's gonna come and then we got to
[02:23:47.027 --> 02:23:48.529]  We've got to stop the trafficking.
[02:23:48.769 --> 02:23:49.670]  This is what we deal with.
[02:23:49.970 --> 02:23:52.693]  Finding and fixing the bad guys that are destroying these children.
[02:23:53.114 --> 02:23:58.440]  Two little girls, seven and eight years old, a year and a half ago on that border, I looked them in the eyes and said, I'm going to take care of you tonight because they were being trafficked.
[02:23:58.940 --> 02:24:00.241]  I had to hand them to the system.
[02:24:00.641 --> 02:24:01.802]  And the system, what happened to them?
[02:24:01.882 --> 02:24:02.223]  I don't know.
[02:24:02.263 --> 02:24:03.523]  Disappeared them.
[02:24:03.543 --> 02:24:04.464]  86,000 are missing that they say.
[02:24:04.544 --> 02:24:06.005]  I'd say more like 150,000.
[02:24:06.706 --> 02:24:07.706]  But that's what we see.
[02:24:08.147 --> 02:24:17.533]  I know right close to Austin here, a little apartment complex where 109 kids were handed off to some sponsor families, two of which were illegal families themselves.
[02:24:17.774 --> 02:24:17.954]  Wow.
[02:24:19.139 --> 02:24:20.760]  It's just, this is the war.
[02:24:20.780 --> 02:24:22.061]  This is the globalist attack.
[02:24:22.101 --> 02:24:22.661]  This is it.
[02:24:23.002 --> 02:24:26.304]  Folks, the bad news is we're in the New World Order.
[02:24:26.324 --> 02:24:27.545]  The good news is the fight's here.
[02:24:28.125 --> 02:24:31.307]  It's like what the Marine Corps General said in Korea, I forget his name.
[02:24:31.327 --> 02:24:32.468]  They were completely surrounded.
[02:24:32.508 --> 02:24:34.590]  He said, we can attack in all directions.
[02:24:34.610 --> 02:24:35.410]  That was Chesty Puller.
[02:24:35.650 --> 02:24:35.871]  Yeah.
[02:24:36.231 --> 02:24:37.532]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:37.552 --> 02:24:41.374]  We are completely surrounded, but we got God on our side.
[02:24:41.394 --> 02:24:42.095]  We got a lot of people.
[02:24:43.257 --> 02:24:47.480]  The Second American Revolution is happening now right in front of you.
[02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:52.163]  And you're tuned in to InfoWars because you're either looking for the truth or you're already a Patreon.
[02:24:52.623 --> 02:25:00.489]  I'm asking you now to realize we are at the fulcrum, the crossroads, in the fight for human destiny and human future.
[02:25:01.169 --> 02:25:02.871]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:25:03.331 --> 02:25:08.576]  Please buy great products at FortWorthStore.com and please pray for the transmission.
[02:25:08.856 --> 02:25:10.037]  Without you, we're going to fail.
[02:25:10.457 --> 02:25:22.334]   But if you simply take action and spread the word and pray for the broadcast and buy the products, you will continue to aid us together in our victory against these tyrants. But now is the time
[02:25:22.334 --> 02:25:26.274]   to make the decision. I know there's millions of forms of media out there and all this BS and
[02:25:26.274 --> 02:25:30.955]   the globalists hope you get lost in all of it. But notice the globalists, the new allure, are coming
[02:25:30.955 --> 02:25:35.845]   after us because they realize we've got their number. Think about it. Infowars is the tip of the
[02:25:35.845 --> 02:25:41.244]   spear. If you want to support the tip of the spear, that decision is up to you. Please support us
[02:25:41.244 --> 02:25:45.174]   now at Infowars.org. All right, we got an incredible guy in here. I'm like, wow, a year and
[02:25:45.174 --> 02:25:46.845]  a half went by since last year.
[02:25:46.845 --> 02:25:49.424]  Why is this guy on all the time? He lives here in Austin.
[02:25:49.424 --> 02:25:54.914]   He's been in the bush. He's been on the border. And he joins us. Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Pete
[02:25:54.914 --> 02:26:00.444]   Chambers, an amazing Green Beret commander, is here with us. And the governor just put out a statement.
[02:26:00.422 --> 02:26:03.022]   statement and people have been mad at Abbott but he's going the right direction.
[02:26:03.022 --> 02:26:04.182]  I'm supporting him.
[02:26:04.182 --> 02:26:07.382]   People said it two weeks ago when he said the feds were going to block you, he'll pass
[02:26:07.382 --> 02:26:08.621]  it, so this isn't real.
[02:26:08.621 --> 02:26:12.341]   Now he says we're not following the federal order, we're putting more barbed wire up,
[02:26:12.341 --> 02:26:15.662]   so when people go in the right direction, whether it's Elon Musk or Joe Rogan or anybody,
[02:26:15.662 --> 02:26:17.902]  we're going to support it folks.
[02:26:17.902 --> 02:26:21.141]   And so Colonel, continuing here, you've got his statement right here.
[02:26:21.141 --> 02:26:23.781]   Yeah, I'm going to share a little bit of this because this is important.
[02:26:23.781 --> 02:26:24.781]  Just broke.
[02:26:25.178 --> 02:26:25.698]  This just broke.
[02:26:25.738 --> 02:26:26.418]  Yeah, this just broke.
[02:26:26.459 --> 02:26:32.260]  I mean, literally handed to me just now and I'm going to put on my glasses because I'm older and dirt and they're gone.
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:33.661]  24th of January, today.
[02:26:33.961 --> 02:26:35.021]  Federal government has broken.
[02:26:35.061 --> 02:26:36.542]  This is Greg Abbott doing this.
[02:26:36.602 --> 02:26:39.203]  And by the way, if you're watching this, sir, thank you.
[02:26:39.763 --> 02:26:45.785]  The last time I spoke to you face to face was in the hangar in Del Rio, Texas with my dog who's sitting down here below me where we were working that border.
[02:26:46.185 --> 02:26:47.125]  And you listened to us then.
[02:26:47.765 --> 02:26:51.206]  Things took a little while for it to come around, but we've been praying for courage for you, sir.
[02:26:51.626 --> 02:26:52.487]  This is what's happening.
[02:26:52.507 --> 02:26:53.147]  You have showed it.
[02:26:53.647 --> 02:26:57.511]  The federal government has broken the compact between the United States and the states.
[02:26:57.571 --> 02:27:06.079]  The executive branch of the United States has a constitutional duty to enforce federal laws protecting states, including immigration laws, on the books right now.
[02:27:06.139 --> 02:27:10.423]  President Biden has refused to enforce those laws and even violated them.
[02:27:10.783 --> 02:27:14.447]  The result is that he has smashed records for illegal immigration.
[02:27:14.487 --> 02:27:15.488]  This is what we're talking about.
[02:27:15.928 --> 02:27:18.149]  This is the enemy right here.
[02:27:18.530 --> 02:27:20.691]  This is their tool of that mainline effort.
[02:27:21.191 --> 02:27:26.035]  Now it goes on to say that James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and the other visionaries who wrote the U.S.
[02:27:26.075 --> 02:27:38.743]  Constitution foresaw states should not be left to the mercy of the lawless president who does nothing to stop external threats like cartels smuggling millions of illegal immigrants across the border.
[02:27:39.163 --> 02:27:45.187]   That is why the framers included both Article 4, Section 4 we spoke of earlier That's a new declaration of independence.
[02:27:45.207 --> 02:27:54.692]  They've broken their compact, the social contact's broken, we're under invasion, and under the 9th Amendment and the 10th Amendment, when the feds don't do their job, all rights revert to the state of the people.
[02:27:54.531 --> 02:27:59.531]   Arizona v. United States. It's signed by Governor Abbott. I suggest you get on his site and look at it.
[02:27:59.531 --> 02:28:04.531]   That's a new declaration of independence. They've broken their compact, the social contact's broken, we're under
[02:28:04.531 --> 02:28:09.902]   invasion, and under the 9th Amendment and the 10th Amendment, when the feds don't do their job, all rights revert
[02:28:09.902 --> 02:28:10.531]  to the state of the people.
[02:28:10.531 --> 02:28:12.531]  Absolutely. Absolutely.
[02:28:13.213 --> 02:28:17.397]  This is what we were talking about this morning back at the one shot where I work, our headquarters.
[02:28:17.417 --> 02:28:19.498]  That's what Thomas Jefferson told him in 1776.
[02:28:20.379 --> 02:28:23.541]  He said, you can dissolve our legislatures, it just reverts to us.
[02:28:23.902 --> 02:28:26.404]  That's right, because the states created the federal government.
[02:28:26.684 --> 02:28:32.729]  Despite the Supremacy Clause, which is a specific Hegelian thing once again, we don't argue in that realm.
[02:28:32.749 --> 02:28:33.970]  We don't argue with tort law.
[02:28:34.330 --> 02:28:36.992]  We argue with common law and with the Constitution.
[02:28:37.272 --> 02:28:38.453]  That is how we get this done.
[02:28:39.254 --> 02:28:40.635]  Common law is the original law.
[02:28:40.715 --> 02:28:41.796]  It's the foundation.
[02:28:42.456 --> 02:28:43.117]  And natural law.
[02:28:43.257 --> 02:28:43.777]  It's the mama.
[02:28:44.038 --> 02:28:46.039]  It is the mama bear of that situation.
[02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:48.421]  We used to have common law courts in Texas, by the way.
[02:28:48.742 --> 02:28:49.502]  We don't have them anymore.
[02:28:49.522 --> 02:28:50.363]  We're going to get back to that.
[02:28:50.483 --> 02:28:53.065]  Governor Abbott, AG Paxton, please.
[02:28:53.226 --> 02:28:53.926]  Let's bring that down.
[02:28:53.946 --> 02:28:54.787]  There's no doubt now.
[02:28:55.007 --> 02:28:56.008]  He's thrown down the gauntlet.
[02:28:56.028 --> 02:28:57.950]  He's told the state guard, ignore federal orders.
[02:28:58.550 --> 02:28:58.990]  Yes, sir.
[02:28:59.010 --> 02:29:01.012]  He said, we're in a martial law.
[02:29:01.072 --> 02:29:02.133]  They created a martial law.
[02:29:02.193 --> 02:29:02.734]  Lawlessness.
[02:29:03.410 --> 02:29:03.590]  Right.
[02:29:03.871 --> 02:29:17.085]  Yeah, the lawlessness that's ensued has now resulted in this second, third order effect of us having to stand up by God's own hand and make this line in the sand that I'm talking about that's got the globalists on their heels, on their spurs.
[02:29:17.105 --> 02:29:17.846]  And they are on their heels!
[02:29:18.524 --> 02:29:19.084]  They're scared.
[02:29:19.724 --> 02:29:24.346]  I don't tell listeners, folks, you've heard me 29 years on air, everybody says, you're too negative, you're too negative.
[02:29:24.606 --> 02:29:26.526]  I'm telling you, we're starting to turn right now.
[02:29:26.827 --> 02:29:27.727]  We're starting to win.
[02:29:27.827 --> 02:29:28.007]  Right.
[02:29:28.487 --> 02:29:28.767]  Okay?
[02:29:29.227 --> 02:29:31.868]  So when they're on their heels, this is a momentum shift.
[02:29:32.188 --> 02:29:38.930]  And when there's a momentum shift, those little tiny cuts or those little tiny victories, that's where we, the people, can make a difference.
[02:29:39.771 --> 02:29:44.012]  One million people on this border, the next convoy that comes by, I'd like to see a million people down here.
[02:29:44.611 --> 02:29:47.334]  We'd fix all our problems if a million peaceful people went to the border now.
[02:29:47.755 --> 02:29:48.195]  Absolutely.
[02:29:48.455 --> 02:29:50.378]  It would overwhelm the system, because that's the technique.
[02:29:50.398 --> 02:29:53.361]  Well, you tell me, Colonel, when I should go, I'm going to go the next... whenever you tell me.
[02:29:53.521 --> 02:29:54.542]  Okay, we'll load up.
[02:29:54.562 --> 02:29:55.824]  We'll take some horses down there and do it.
[02:29:56.564 --> 02:29:56.805]  Alright.
[02:29:58.086 --> 02:30:04.918]   Yeah, I would suggest that every single person out there We listened to this earlier, and I want to share this first.
[02:30:05.038 --> 02:30:08.640]  Paul Harvey, if I were the devil, he played that during the break before we started here.
[02:30:09.101 --> 02:30:09.801]  If I were the devil.
[02:30:09.901 --> 02:30:11.782]  Everything that he said is happening to us right now.
[02:30:12.442 --> 02:30:15.564]  This is the technique and tactics and practices of the devil.
[02:30:15.964 --> 02:30:19.006]  Now we're coming in with the techniques and practices of the Lord and Savior.
[02:30:19.046 --> 02:30:23.188]  So, to me, the feds are obligated by oath, and they understand section four.
[02:30:23.348 --> 02:30:29.512]   They argue that, but then when they turn it around in court, and they end up with this result, of chaos.
[02:30:30.073 --> 02:30:31.314]  What do we do to control chaos?
[02:30:31.334 --> 02:30:33.676]  And here's what Linda Robinson wrote in a book about the Green Berets.
[02:30:34.277 --> 02:30:38.621]  The way the Green Berets are masters of chaos is by controlling the controllables.
[02:30:39.001 --> 02:30:39.922]  Those are the little things.
[02:30:40.282 --> 02:30:45.327]  When I'm doing my parachute, when I'm jumping out of a plane, I control the controllables when I have a shoot malfunction.
[02:30:45.567 --> 02:30:46.969]  The little things make the difference.
[02:30:47.549 --> 02:30:54.151]  These little victories are gonna do it, and I promise you, there will be more letters from Greg Abbott to our citizens in this state from days to come.
[02:30:54.691 --> 02:30:57.132]  And I commend both him and the Attorney General on that.
[02:30:57.152 --> 02:30:58.972]  What do you think finally triggered him to take action?
[02:30:59.012 --> 02:30:59.733]  Just the outcry?
[02:31:00.593 --> 02:31:01.033]  The outcry.
[02:31:01.573 --> 02:31:02.033]  I know that.
[02:31:02.573 --> 02:31:09.784]   Because every little thing that happens on that border When we get it out to people like you, because it's not going out on mainstream media, right?
[02:31:09.944 --> 02:31:10.804]  We've got the Ann Vandersteen.
[02:31:10.824 --> 02:31:12.685]  It's only because the listener's getting it out.
[02:31:12.725 --> 02:31:13.045]  Yes sir.
[02:31:13.505 --> 02:31:15.965]  And those of us that have six, seven thousand people that follow.
[02:31:15.985 --> 02:31:18.446]  And everybody knows if we don't fight this, we're complicit.
[02:31:19.086 --> 02:31:20.507]  You are complicit, absolutely.
[02:31:20.867 --> 02:31:24.687]  If you don't fight this, you're complicit because- You're involved in child trafficking, you don't stop this.
[02:31:24.727 --> 02:31:27.148]  And in the good, but that's called a sin of omission.
[02:31:27.228 --> 02:31:28.568]  You can't just say, well I didn't know.
[02:31:28.868 --> 02:31:35.190]  Because the people in Germany in World War II that were sitting in church as the trains went by, turn up the music because we don't want to hear them crying.
[02:31:35.905 --> 02:31:36.245]  You knew.
[02:31:37.365 --> 02:31:37.986]  That's where we're at.
[02:31:38.366 --> 02:31:39.646]  We've got to embolden these people.
[02:31:40.006 --> 02:31:40.926]  And this is how we do it.
[02:31:41.366 --> 02:31:42.707]  Exactly like I said.
[02:31:42.747 --> 02:31:43.587]  And the enemy's scared.
[02:31:43.627 --> 02:31:44.607]  Why do you think they're so scared?
[02:31:44.627 --> 02:31:45.108]  Because they are.
[02:31:45.128 --> 02:31:45.888]  They admit they're scared.
[02:31:46.048 --> 02:31:50.089]  Well they admit they're scared because they see the power of God.
[02:31:50.649 --> 02:31:51.749]  And that's a fearful thing.
[02:31:51.769 --> 02:31:53.170]  That puts fear in their eyes.
[02:31:53.190 --> 02:31:55.510]  But also they see the power of the people.
[02:31:55.930 --> 02:31:56.511]  We the people.
[02:31:56.811 --> 02:31:59.171]  They see that and that's the thing they fear the most.
[02:31:59.491 --> 02:32:00.632]  Because they're the elites.
[02:32:00.692 --> 02:32:02.252]  What do they call themselves at Davos?
[02:32:02.412 --> 02:32:02.992]  The elites.
[02:32:03.713 --> 02:32:03.913]  Alright.
[02:32:04.253 --> 02:32:05.013]  We are the people.
[02:32:05.553 --> 02:32:09.075]  And we remain the people, and we will stand firm to that grounding.
[02:32:09.576 --> 02:32:11.817]  But that's what they're afraid of, is we the people.
[02:32:12.297 --> 02:32:14.939]  Because they know that there will be accountability.
[02:32:15.139 --> 02:32:19.742]  And accountability is what says, hey I'm sorry bro, you broke the law, I gotta put you in jail.
[02:32:20.142 --> 02:32:24.225]  So, these convoys, just like the show today won't save the world, but the little victories together will.
[02:32:24.585 --> 02:32:25.606]  Many hands make light work.
[02:32:25.966 --> 02:32:30.369]  Tell us about these three big convoys about to start, how people get involved, how they support it.
[02:32:30.709 --> 02:32:40.906]   First of all, go to TakeOurBorderBack.com Now I ended up being kind of the Texas lead on this as far as on the ground.
[02:32:41.186 --> 02:32:47.730]  Telling them where to go, how to do it, to keep it safe, talking to law enforcement, making sure they understand it's a peaceful assembly.
[02:32:48.191 --> 02:32:52.013]  Alright, so go to that website, that's where you need to go, it's right there at the bottom, thank you.
[02:32:52.493 --> 02:32:57.556]  And what that'll do is it'll show you how you can link up, because somewhere along the way, you could start moving.
[02:32:57.596 --> 02:33:01.439]  I talked to a Canadian trucker the other day that's going to come all the way from Canada to join this thing.
[02:33:02.079 --> 02:33:04.761]  An Australian, he can't join this thing, but he came on.
[02:33:04.821 --> 02:33:05.561]  I'm glad you mentioned that.
[02:33:05.601 --> 02:33:07.062]  Guys, show the footage out of Europe.
[02:33:07.082 --> 02:33:08.503]  The tractors, the trucks.
[02:33:08.943 --> 02:33:09.703]  Show Canada.
[02:33:10.343 --> 02:33:11.984]  This is happening worldwide.
[02:33:12.804 --> 02:33:14.105]  This is so powerful.
[02:33:14.125 --> 02:33:14.785]  They're scared of this.
[02:33:14.925 --> 02:33:15.926]  Yeah, they understand this.
[02:33:15.986 --> 02:33:17.886]  And they're ahead of the game on this.
[02:33:18.527 --> 02:33:20.207]  We are behind the game on that.
[02:33:20.828 --> 02:33:22.168]  And this is my theory on that.
[02:33:22.588 --> 02:33:23.929]  Americans, we are comfortable.
[02:33:24.229 --> 02:33:27.230]  We are comfortable because we can go down... Well, they're already cutting off their fertilizer and everything.
[02:33:27.310 --> 02:33:28.691]  I mean, they're down the wire.
[02:33:28.911 --> 02:33:30.873]  Yeah, they're down to the wire, so they realize it.
[02:33:31.173 --> 02:33:34.897]  But we have to use that as a temperature gauge, because remember what I said about being left to bang?
[02:33:35.217 --> 02:33:36.959]  The forecasting in warfare.
[02:33:37.359 --> 02:33:40.622]  I'm going to interrupt you, but Europeans are known to be docile.
[02:33:41.162 --> 02:33:44.365]  They're dumping hundreds of trucks of manure in front of the government buildings.
[02:33:44.405 --> 02:33:45.887]  I mean, they're running over stuff.
[02:33:45.907 --> 02:33:46.627]  They're pissed.
[02:33:48.109 --> 02:33:52.593]  No, that's a perfect segue, because they know that they won't... You're explaining warfare, I'm going to interrupt you.
[02:33:52.653 --> 02:33:53.013]  That's okay.
[02:33:53.334 --> 02:33:54.395]  They know that they won't eat.
[02:33:55.075 --> 02:33:56.816]  If they don't do this, okay?
[02:33:57.077 --> 02:33:59.378]  That fuse to that bang is a lot shorter.
[02:33:59.678 --> 02:34:04.161]  For us, when we know this and we see this information, that's intelligence.
[02:34:04.361 --> 02:34:06.403]  And intelligence drives operations.
[02:34:06.843 --> 02:34:08.244]  When I get intelligence, I see it.
[02:34:08.724 --> 02:34:10.645]  And there's a global uprising against tyranny.
[02:34:10.665 --> 02:34:11.126]  Let's join it.
[02:34:12.092 --> 02:34:13.232]  That's the momentum, right?
[02:34:13.633 --> 02:34:14.633]  So here's what I do.
[02:34:14.933 --> 02:34:21.295]  When I go into a building and I've got bad guys in a room, and I hear magazines dropping on the floor when they're changing their mags, that's the momentum shift.
[02:34:21.595 --> 02:34:23.556]  I've got to go in because they're now on their heels.
[02:34:23.776 --> 02:34:25.417]  They're out of ammo and I've got to go in.
[02:34:26.017 --> 02:34:27.698]  And sometimes you've got casualties in war.
[02:34:27.778 --> 02:34:28.178]  I got it.
[02:34:28.538 --> 02:34:30.178]  But you have to move at that time.
[02:34:30.198 --> 02:34:30.999]  You've got to move quick.
[02:34:31.719 --> 02:34:33.780]  And it's speed, surprise, and violence of action.
[02:34:33.840 --> 02:34:35.640]  In this case, we're going to take out the violence.
[02:34:35.940 --> 02:34:38.021]  But speed and surprise, they're going to be our allies.
[02:34:38.041 --> 02:34:39.382]  So how are we decisive right now?
[02:34:39.402 --> 02:34:39.702]  What do we do?
[02:34:40.382 --> 02:34:41.843]  We are decisively engaged.
[02:34:42.403 --> 02:34:43.023]  Absolutely.
[02:34:43.443 --> 02:34:49.106]  And the way to do that, now that they are on their heels, is to push that at all levels.
[02:34:49.626 --> 02:34:55.929]  Anybody out there that's on the election steal stuff, anybody out there that's on the food service industry... Redouble your efforts!
[02:34:56.209 --> 02:34:57.170]  Redouble your efforts.
[02:34:57.230 --> 02:34:57.690]  Dig down.
[02:34:57.970 --> 02:34:59.791]  Get up early in the morning, go to bed later at night.
[02:34:59.811 --> 02:35:00.371]  That's what I do.
[02:35:00.571 --> 02:35:01.472]  That's why I'm turning gray.
[02:35:01.512 --> 02:35:02.952]  This is just happening right in front of you.
[02:35:03.253 --> 02:35:04.713]  But this is how this is going to work.
[02:35:05.353 --> 02:35:06.794]  Is everybody... I love that.
[02:35:06.894 --> 02:35:10.453]   Redouble your efforts because Call to action is a call to action.
[02:35:10.473 --> 02:35:11.914]  It's not a call to complacency.
[02:35:12.374 --> 02:35:18.396]  I didn't create this little letter here because it's cool, because it sounds like... But it's exciting to fight tyranny!
[02:35:19.336 --> 02:35:22.157]  Oh, it's the best thing in the world, because we fulfill a victory!
[02:35:22.497 --> 02:35:29.019]  When you feel victory, and you come home and there's honor... Okay, let me give you the rest of the story on Cyr, on being a captive.
[02:35:30.057 --> 02:35:32.938]  Nick Rowe, Vietnam, Green Beret, five years.
[02:35:33.518 --> 02:35:35.459]  He was in a prison camp in North Vietnam.
[02:35:35.799 --> 02:35:37.539]  He was talking about how to beat Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:35:37.579 --> 02:35:39.320]  How to beat Stockholm Syndrome, yes.
[02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:43.661]  When he came back, he taught us how to beat Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:35:43.921 --> 02:35:47.102]  The little victories, but remember this now, because this is going to be key.
[02:35:48.042 --> 02:35:51.384]  That in your head, you've got to remember to return with honor.
[02:35:51.845 --> 02:35:54.586]  The honor, prestige, and esprit de corps of what is that flag?
[02:35:55.027 --> 02:35:56.408]  What is that constitution?
[02:35:56.688 --> 02:35:59.250]  That's what we've got to return to because there's honor in that.
[02:35:59.490 --> 02:36:00.390]  And that's exciting.
[02:36:00.610 --> 02:36:01.191]  That's a win.
[02:36:01.931 --> 02:36:02.692]  And I like W's.
[02:36:04.014 --> 02:36:04.375]  Yeah.
[02:36:04.535 --> 02:36:05.356]  So keep going.
[02:36:05.556 --> 02:36:05.896]  Exactly.
[02:36:05.936 --> 02:36:07.879]  Don't let all these attacks go, oh my God, it's terrible.
[02:36:07.919 --> 02:36:09.200]  No, this is an attack.
[02:36:09.260 --> 02:36:10.522]  It's our historical chance to beat it.
[02:36:10.842 --> 02:36:13.365]  No, because we don't live in a spirit of fear and I'm going to share a scripture.
[02:36:13.385 --> 02:36:13.885]  Is that okay?
[02:36:14.006 --> 02:36:14.286]  Please.
[02:36:14.346 --> 02:36:15.547]  Philippians 4, 6, and 7.
[02:36:15.587 --> 02:36:17.269]  This kid taught it to me in downrange.
[02:36:17.289 --> 02:36:22.135]  This is what kept him alive until the day that he took a round and ended up letting me go on.
[02:36:23.595 --> 02:36:24.837]  Philippians 4, 6, and 7.
[02:36:24.877 --> 02:36:32.266]  Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything through prayer and petition, present your request to God, and the peace of God that transcends all understanding will guard your heart and your mind in Christ Jesus.
[02:36:32.586 --> 02:36:41.417]  So I lived every day after that, learned that thing, learned it hard, and prayed my way through combat so that my hands would stay steady when I was stopping somebody's bleeding or putting their guts back in their belly.
[02:36:41.797 --> 02:36:43.018]  That's what I did to stay alive.
[02:36:43.539 --> 02:36:48.623]  So, I might have taken a round or two downrange, but I didn't suffer anywhere near as some of these other fellers did.
[02:36:49.003 --> 02:36:58.130]  And I promise you that, that these unseen wounds, although some of them come in the form of a vaccine in your arm, those are casualties of war.
[02:36:58.150 --> 02:36:59.431]  And you got sick from the fire?
[02:36:59.451 --> 02:36:59.731]  Yes, sir.
[02:36:59.951 --> 02:37:07.837]  I took the first round of that and I ended up getting pretty sick, but I also stood up and said to the general, hey, you're not going to do any more of this because there's informed consent.
[02:37:07.877 --> 02:37:08.637]  He said, don't do it.
[02:37:08.958 --> 02:37:10.299]  I said, that's an unlawful order, sir.
[02:37:11.206 --> 02:37:16.589]  And that's when I lost the game of rock, paper, rank, but I won the game of honesty.
[02:37:16.869 --> 02:37:25.874]  So it's beautiful, because I'm reminded by you, and I'm with you all the time, and I wish you would call me, I'll give you my number, because Tucker was like, hey, you know, can they call this today?
[02:37:25.894 --> 02:37:28.216]  Can he do yours, your studio for an interview Thursday?
[02:37:28.236 --> 02:37:29.557]  I'm like, yeah, we're going to get him on too.
[02:37:30.317 --> 02:37:35.340]  We need to get everybody on board right now for this Trucker Convoy.
[02:37:35.936 --> 02:37:36.236]  Yes, sir.
[02:37:36.676 --> 02:37:37.276]  So how do we do that?
[02:37:37.737 --> 02:37:47.440]  Okay, so again, get back to the TakeOurBorderBack.com and understand that you need to get to them because they're getting ready to lay out, to get on the road there.
[02:37:47.880 --> 02:37:54.803]  And if you can't, get down to Eagle Pass, go directly there, if you get there on the 3rd, if you are within the Texas vicinity.
[02:37:55.243 --> 02:37:58.764]  It is down southwest, this side of the Big Bend.
[02:37:58.964 --> 02:38:00.965]  This is the last thing Mayorkas wants.
[02:38:01.405 --> 02:38:03.386]  This is a whole bunch of people.
[02:38:03.966 --> 02:38:06.148]  By the way, you're not just there for the media to cover you.
[02:38:06.288 --> 02:38:09.950]  You're putting it out on X and Facebook and Rumble.
[02:38:10.610 --> 02:38:11.671]  It's a huge media event.
[02:38:12.031 --> 02:38:12.391]  It's huge.
[02:38:12.791 --> 02:38:14.953]  And let me tell you about that coward, Mayorkas.
[02:38:15.313 --> 02:38:19.955]  So I was down there when he stood in front of a bridge that had 7,000 people under it.
[02:38:20.476 --> 02:38:24.495]   The day after, he moved them out of there to say, These are not the droids you're looking for.
[02:38:24.535 --> 02:38:25.196]  These people aren't here.
[02:38:25.436 --> 02:38:25.916]  No, they were.
[02:38:25.936 --> 02:38:28.138]  So the old lie was there was no border crisis.
[02:38:28.319 --> 02:38:28.919]  Now they admit it.
[02:38:29.039 --> 02:38:29.199]  Right.
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:30.340]  So now they're admitting it.
[02:38:30.420 --> 02:38:31.581]  So now they're not doing their jobs.
[02:38:31.661 --> 02:38:34.204]  But I say that at the senior level.
[02:38:34.544 --> 02:38:36.386]  At the tactical level, listen to this.
[02:38:36.426 --> 02:38:36.906]  This is great.
[02:38:36.926 --> 02:38:38.367]  This is insider information, folks.
[02:38:39.417 --> 02:38:42.440]  The agents that are down there right now in Eagle Pass, this is what they're telling us.
[02:38:42.780 --> 02:38:44.662]  Thank God for the Texas National Guard.
[02:38:45.282 --> 02:38:46.443]  Because they're doing the right thing.
[02:38:46.804 --> 02:38:48.545]  Well, they've ordered the Border Patrol to go after them.
[02:38:48.565 --> 02:38:49.086]  They refused.
[02:38:49.646 --> 02:38:50.126]  Absolutely.
[02:38:50.487 --> 02:38:50.667]  Yeah.
[02:38:50.927 --> 02:38:55.351]  So, we're seeing dissension in their ranks, which means that, once again... Which is decisive by Abbott.
[02:38:55.371 --> 02:38:57.693]  This is really... I mean, I gotta praise Abbott here.
[02:38:58.093 --> 02:38:58.954]  This is decisive.
[02:39:00.576 --> 02:39:01.416]  I salute you, sir.
[02:39:01.536 --> 02:39:02.657]  I mean, this is a moment in time.
[02:39:02.777 --> 02:39:03.638]  This is historic.
[02:39:03.658 --> 02:39:05.420]  He's forcing the crisis in the open.
[02:39:06.072 --> 02:39:07.273]  This is a historic moment.
[02:39:07.112 --> 02:39:08.992]  Yes, he's bringing it to light.
[02:39:08.992 --> 02:39:14.552]   And for those that don't know, it's even come out, Biden is ordering the Border Patrol to
[02:39:14.552 --> 02:39:17.153]  physically go after the Texas Guard.
[02:39:17.153 --> 02:39:18.391]  It's not happening.
[02:39:18.391 --> 02:39:23.592]   So it's just an action of, we are literally holding the ground.
[02:39:23.592 --> 02:39:30.192]   It was to be that there would be up to a three-year jail sentence and $5,000 fine per guardsman
[02:39:30.192 --> 02:39:32.192]  that was standing in that Shelby Park.
[02:39:32.542 --> 02:39:34.623]  That was what the intent was.
[02:39:35.043 --> 02:39:37.464]  But it's not the intent now because they've backed off.
[02:39:38.024 --> 02:39:38.984]  That was a paper tiger.
[02:39:40.344 --> 02:39:42.425]  And so that's why I said this two weeks ago when I started.
[02:39:42.465 --> 02:39:44.385]  I said, folks, don't underestimate this.
[02:39:45.625 --> 02:39:48.046]  Abbott is creating a confrontation to show what's happening right now.
[02:39:48.510 --> 02:39:48.870]  That's right.
[02:39:49.471 --> 02:39:56.318]  So this is bringing light to it, and that is he's doing exactly what you would do in an information war, an information operation as we call it.
[02:39:56.758 --> 02:40:08.750]  So part of that, as we are dealing with an insurgency that is from within, the moral injury of our government, the moral injury of our Department of Defense, all of our institutions are morally broken.
[02:40:08.890 --> 02:40:09.271]  Captured!
[02:40:09.984 --> 02:40:11.625]  They are captured, absolutely.
[02:40:12.045 --> 02:40:12.805]  And so what does that do?
[02:40:12.845 --> 02:40:14.806]  That trickles down to those that are still in the ranks.
[02:40:15.327 --> 02:40:23.291]  So my brothers and sisters out there in the Department of Defense that are still there, those people that signed that declaration, that declaration of military accountability, get it out.
[02:40:23.851 --> 02:40:24.271]  Bring it out.
[02:40:24.511 --> 02:40:24.971]  That's key.
[02:40:25.272 --> 02:40:28.133]  They may have the top, they don't have the middle or the bottom.
[02:40:28.433 --> 02:40:30.214]  A thousand cuts right now, that's what we gotta do.
[02:40:30.554 --> 02:40:38.197]   So they know that, they're sitting on their, they're sitting on go right now, that group is completely on in tune with what they need to do.
[02:40:38.197 --> 02:40:39.197]  And I should have started the interview.
[02:40:39.197 --> 02:40:40.197]  It came out yesterday.
[02:40:40.197 --> 02:40:43.996]   Biden ordered the Border Patrol to go physically remove them.
[02:40:43.996 --> 02:40:44.996]  They said no.
[02:40:44.996 --> 02:40:47.397]  This is a game of chicken.
[02:40:47.397 --> 02:40:49.076]  The feds just lost it so far.
[02:40:49.076 --> 02:40:51.556]  Yes, they backed down on this one.
[02:40:51.556 --> 02:40:52.556]  That doesn't mean there won't be others.
[02:40:52.556 --> 02:40:53.755]  There'll be counter offensive.
[02:40:53.755 --> 02:40:54.755]  So what are they going to try next?
[02:40:54.755 --> 02:40:58.396]   So they're going to send a shooter down to shoot some of the illegals to make us make
[02:40:59.313 --> 02:41:02.676]  No, they're going to do what they do every time, which is they're going to put a bright, shiny object up.
[02:41:02.696 --> 02:41:11.405]  They're going to find something else about Hunter Biden right now, or we're going to find something else that's going to keep us focused on D.C., the District of Columbia, which doesn't even belong to the United States.
[02:41:11.665 --> 02:41:13.767]  It's a distraction technique, because that's what I do.
[02:41:13.787 --> 02:41:14.588]  The border is everything.
[02:41:14.608 --> 02:41:16.330]  That's the main globalist assault.
[02:41:16.910 --> 02:41:19.593]  Yes, and the distractions are the flashbangs in the room.
[02:41:19.993 --> 02:41:22.254]  All you gotta do is close your eyes, open your mouth, you'll be fine.
[02:41:22.294 --> 02:41:23.795]  That's what happens when a flashbang goes off.
[02:41:24.035 --> 02:41:25.056]  And then you get back to fighting.
[02:41:25.416 --> 02:41:27.197]  But you gotta understand that that thing will come.
[02:41:27.337 --> 02:41:27.817]  Whatever it is.
[02:41:27.897 --> 02:41:29.138]  Disease X. Who knows?
[02:41:29.258 --> 02:41:31.339]  You just had a doctor on that I respect.
[02:41:31.719 --> 02:41:41.905]  And that disease process, that pandemic health emergency of international concern of the World Health Organization, by the way, on the 27th, they're gonna rule on the international health regulations.
[02:41:42.365 --> 02:41:46.307]  That's trying to usurp authorities from all these nations who have not signed on.
[02:41:47.179 --> 02:41:48.660]  But you know what the beautiful part about this is?
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:49.800]  You were a private guy.
[02:41:49.820 --> 02:41:56.043]  I'm getting to meet all these amazing men and women that were just leading private lives that are now being led to fight this.
[02:41:56.964 --> 02:41:58.444]  Like, are you meeting some amazing people?
[02:41:58.524 --> 02:42:00.785]  I'm meeting the most amazing people in the world.
[02:42:00.825 --> 02:42:06.208]  I mean, these are people that, former tier one operators, that people that have signed on to help us out.
[02:42:07.028 --> 02:42:07.889]  You will never know them.
[02:42:07.949 --> 02:42:10.070]  I'm the face of this operation, but you will never know them.
[02:42:10.170 --> 02:42:12.931]  And they are doing things for this country on this border.
[02:42:13.860 --> 02:42:19.126]  That you will never hear and it'll just be us with cigars and scotch one evening talking about it and said, you know what, good job.
[02:42:20.588 --> 02:42:22.690]  What else can we do to save the country?
[02:42:25.814 --> 02:42:31.200]  Second Chronicle 714, if my people humble themselves and get on their knees and turn back to me, I'll heal their land.
[02:42:31.917 --> 02:42:32.837]  Okay, that's key.
[02:42:33.138 --> 02:42:34.618]  We've got to have those prayer warriors out there.
[02:42:34.658 --> 02:42:37.279]  The other things that we can do is you've got to be prepared.
[02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:42.222]  Because there will be a period of time that I, in my estimate, that they're going to try to squash us.
[02:42:42.302 --> 02:42:43.922]  And I don't know what that looks like.
[02:42:44.002 --> 02:42:46.503]  Is that going to be a... They're going to truck bomb a federal building or something?
[02:42:46.523 --> 02:42:47.084]  Cyber attack.
[02:42:47.124 --> 02:42:48.624]  Is it going to be a... Power outage.
[02:42:48.684 --> 02:42:49.245]  Power outage.
[02:42:49.265 --> 02:42:52.066]  I mean, the grid is definitely... They've been pre-programming that.
[02:42:52.506 --> 02:42:55.289]  Right, they've been, what is that, predictive programming?
[02:42:55.309 --> 02:42:55.389]  Yeah.
[02:42:55.689 --> 02:42:57.531]  Okay, so they've been doing that with these movies and all that stuff.
[02:42:57.831 --> 02:42:58.973]  Just don't pay attention to that stuff.
[02:42:59.073 --> 02:43:00.094]  Don't get in their game.
[02:43:00.474 --> 02:43:02.436]  That's what you do on that kind of stuff.
[02:43:02.476 --> 02:43:04.598]  Don't get in their game because they want you to be scared.
[02:43:05.099 --> 02:43:05.980]  Fear is their tactic.
[02:43:06.060 --> 02:43:07.061]  Once again, Philippians 4-6-7.
[02:43:07.101 --> 02:43:14.288]  So we've got to remember that to keep them on their heels right now while we're pushing this, all these little lines of effort got to continue, those little victories.
[02:43:14.708 --> 02:43:25.973]  And there are so many, but doubling down, exactly as Alex said, I respect that and I think that that's what each industry, each industry that's out there, each avenue, each line of effort.
[02:43:26.113 --> 02:43:26.793]  Infrastructure.
[02:43:27.053 --> 02:43:28.274]  Infrastructure, absolutely.
[02:43:28.634 --> 02:43:30.915]  You know, the people that, the railroads.
[02:43:30.955 --> 02:43:32.195]  Let me tell you about East Palestine.
[02:43:32.215 --> 02:43:33.936]  I don't know if you remember that train derailment.
[02:43:33.996 --> 02:43:34.556]  I do, yeah.
[02:43:34.896 --> 02:43:37.597]  I went up there and researched that thing and I was there on the ground for four days.
[02:43:37.937 --> 02:43:39.538]  That was a derailment, that was intended.
[02:43:39.598 --> 02:43:44.280]  Oh, Antifa's attacking, they've been caught, they're covering up, they're setting fires everywhere, they're blowing up food processors.
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:46.241]  By the way, Pete is behind that, yeah.
[02:43:46.060 --> 02:43:47.581]  Pete is behind that, you know.
[02:43:47.581 --> 02:43:48.581]  I believe it.
[02:43:48.581 --> 02:43:49.581]  Yeah, I believe it.
[02:43:49.581 --> 02:43:50.940]  The people for ethical treatment.
[02:43:50.940 --> 02:43:53.261]  That's a whole CIA cult.
[02:43:53.261 --> 02:43:54.739]  There's a lot of cults going on, yeah.
[02:43:54.739 --> 02:43:59.140]   And we need to keep exposing those things because as we expose them, they get more on
[02:43:59.140 --> 02:44:00.579]  their heels, they make mistakes.
[02:44:00.730 --> 02:44:04.171]  When you get people fearful, when they're fearful, they'll make mistakes.
[02:44:04.191 --> 02:44:10.413]  Well that's the good news, is I look at the left and their controllers, and they even admit their documents leak, they are crapping themselves.
[02:44:10.913 --> 02:44:14.354]  So I'm not saying we're even winning this yet folks, but our enemies are definitely scared.
[02:44:14.634 --> 02:44:15.314]  Why do you think that is?
[02:44:16.109 --> 02:44:16.709]  Because they're evil.
[02:44:16.949 --> 02:44:18.770]  And any evil hides from the light.
[02:44:18.930 --> 02:44:27.052]  And they know that there will be some sort of accountability, which will result in either, for treasonous people in wartime, it is a death penalty.
[02:44:27.092 --> 02:44:28.492]  I hate to say it, but that's just a fact.
[02:44:29.092 --> 02:44:34.673]  Well, and that's my concern, is they're creating such a crisis, they're gonna lose.
[02:44:34.753 --> 02:44:37.174]  I can see, 90% chance they lose.
[02:44:37.594 --> 02:44:39.955]  Or they'll be in a nuclear war and we'll all lose at that.
[02:44:42.068 --> 02:44:44.751]  What is the second, third, fourth order that comes out of that crisis?
[02:44:45.171 --> 02:44:51.137]  I don't want to... You come out of the French Revolution, you get a Napoleon Bonaparte, or you come out of Versailles, you get a Hitler.
[02:44:51.217 --> 02:44:56.082]  How do we not have a victory against them, but then have that spin into something bad?
[02:44:56.222 --> 02:44:57.504]  I don't want to put the cart before the horse.
[02:44:57.844 --> 02:44:59.626]  That's down the road, but I'm really concerned.
[02:45:00.006 --> 02:45:05.450]  I think that happens to the parallel economies, the parallel systems that are already starting to happen in Texas.
[02:45:05.530 --> 02:45:09.633]  I deal with five different communities, and those things are going to get us through those moments.
[02:45:09.993 --> 02:45:14.036]  But we also have to have that next generation of legislators to stand up.
[02:45:14.456 --> 02:45:21.401]  Because if we don't, exactly what you talked about in Bastiat, actually the law, he wrote this after the French Revolution, talked about this.
[02:45:21.841 --> 02:45:26.003]  He says that the whole purpose of the legislator is to conduct legal plunder.
[02:45:26.223 --> 02:45:28.525]  He uses that over and over and over in that treatise that he wrote.
[02:45:28.805 --> 02:45:29.345]  It's amazing.
[02:45:29.405 --> 02:45:30.145]  Read it sometime.
[02:45:30.205 --> 02:45:32.387]  That's how I understood what was going on at that level.
[02:45:32.667 --> 02:45:35.988]  So we don't want to bring in another type of legislator that's focused on that.
[02:45:36.269 --> 02:45:37.289]  We need to have term limits.
[02:45:37.309 --> 02:45:40.010]  We need to have not a career out of being up there.
[02:45:40.031 --> 02:45:44.873]  We need to get rid of the special executive staff of the military that are the continuity.
[02:45:44.913 --> 02:45:48.155]  Yeah, what do you make of Austin and him not even being there for a month?
[02:45:49.175 --> 02:45:50.436]  It's the end of an old order.
[02:45:50.776 --> 02:45:52.077]  It's a rotting system.
[02:45:52.177 --> 02:45:53.218]  Yeah, that's a rotting system.
[02:45:53.458 --> 02:45:59.401]  They are the perpetrators of this brokenness that the military is dealing with.
[02:46:00.722 --> 02:46:01.863]  1975 was the last.
[02:46:02.303 --> 02:46:01.863]  73.
[02:46:02.643 --> 02:46:03.944]  That's where we're at on recruiting now.
[02:46:04.024 --> 02:46:04.724]  Post-Vietnam.
[02:46:05.184 --> 02:46:06.345]  Retention in the gutter.
[02:46:06.585 --> 02:46:07.866]  Wokeness is breaking us.
[02:46:07.966 --> 02:46:09.047]  We need to focus on warfighting.
[02:46:09.067 --> 02:46:13.529]  But they wanted to purge the military, but it was so good, it destroyed their own power.
[02:46:13.569 --> 02:46:14.410]  Now they're saying, come back.
[02:46:15.111 --> 02:46:16.391]  Well, they said come back.
[02:46:16.451 --> 02:46:21.553]  They wanted to do that, but hardly anybody's doing it because they don't trust that system right now.
[02:46:21.593 --> 02:46:29.495]  Look, my own son is going into the military with the intent of becoming a Green Beret, and I have to tell him, understand the environment that you're going in.
[02:46:29.775 --> 02:46:30.996]  God bless you for doing it.
[02:46:31.696 --> 02:46:37.220]  But it breaks my heart to think that he's got to fight not only the enemy downrange, but the enemy within.
[02:46:37.700 --> 02:46:38.761]  But he's willing to do it.
[02:46:39.161 --> 02:46:42.344]  Because we need those ranks to continue to be there to fill those ranks later on.
[02:46:42.444 --> 02:46:42.924]  Absolutely.
[02:46:42.944 --> 02:46:55.393]  But my point was, they tried to purge the military and did so well, now they're like, whoa, they thought they would do a partial purge, now they're like admitting that they're decapitated because of their own action.
[02:46:55.553 --> 02:46:58.315]  Because the leaders that they got rid of were the critical thinkers.
[02:46:59.170 --> 02:46:59.751]  Right.
[02:46:59.912 --> 02:47:07.307]  The critical thinkers were the ones that got rid of it, but there are some still... Yeah, the generals just play golf and act powerful, but all the real operators left, so they're like, they're blind.
[02:47:08.339 --> 02:47:17.607]  They're blind in many regards, but there's still a remnant within the military that still holds true to that, because there were some of those signatories to that declaration that are still in, who I respect immensely.
[02:47:17.687 --> 02:47:18.248]  Absolutely.
[02:47:20.029 --> 02:47:20.610]  It's a paradox.
[02:47:20.870 --> 02:47:21.851]  We've got two minutes left.
[02:47:22.291 --> 02:47:24.093]  How do people get behind the convoy again?
[02:47:24.493 --> 02:47:25.154]  So exciting.
[02:47:25.354 --> 02:47:26.435]  I'll probably go.
[02:47:26.835 --> 02:47:27.656]  Reporters will go.
[02:47:28.197 --> 02:47:29.538]  But when does this kick off?
[02:47:29.778 --> 02:47:31.059]  TakeOurBorderBack.com.
[02:47:31.099 --> 02:47:34.140]  It's going to be kicking off in the state of Texas on the 1st.
[02:47:34.601 --> 02:47:40.884]  There will be a little bit of the convoy that will circle the Capitol to now praise Governor Abbott for his actions.
[02:47:41.204 --> 02:47:43.365]  Beep those horns and let him know that he's doing a good job.
[02:47:43.425 --> 02:47:43.945]  It's peaceful.
[02:47:44.125 --> 02:47:44.926]  It's a peaceful assembly.
[02:47:45.606 --> 02:47:48.648]  Also that evening in Dripping Springs, people are going to come out there on the website.
[02:47:48.668 --> 02:47:51.589]  You'll see it and you'll know exactly where we're going to be.
[02:47:52.010 --> 02:47:56.272]  And then after that, the convoy is going to continue on on the 2nd down to Eagle Pass.
[02:47:56.812 --> 02:47:58.175]  And that's where we'll be located there.
[02:47:58.275 --> 02:48:01.460]  And there's some other convoys all the way from the East Coast that are going to Arizona?
[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:01.681]  Yes.
[02:48:01.701 --> 02:48:03.745]  And some will go on to Yuma, Arizona from there.
[02:48:03.865 --> 02:48:09.936]  There will be also the San Ysidro, California portion of this, which will be just located for the people going to the West.
[02:48:10.560 --> 02:48:18.703]  And I want to be clear, it's not about tooting my horn, but I said last week, this is real, Abbott's creating a confrontation, and I got attacked by people, oh no, Abbott's terrible.
[02:48:18.743 --> 02:48:22.644]  I said, no, he's moving over here, there's major pressure, watch what he does.
[02:48:22.684 --> 02:48:27.746]  I gotta say now, they're putting up more barbed wire, they're telling the Fed, screw you, he's put out a Declaration of Independence.
[02:48:28.006 --> 02:48:31.607]  Folks, when we get victory, when we've had defeat so long, recognize what it is.
[02:48:31.627 --> 02:48:34.068]  It's like Elon Musk getting perfect, but he's hurting the globalists.
[02:48:34.128 --> 02:48:36.488]  We need to stop taking victories as losses.
[02:48:36.808 --> 02:48:38.409]  We gotta get ready to win.
[02:48:38.709 --> 02:48:46.414]  Right, and exactly, because what happens is if they get you off on your heels, and then you start dividing, right?
[02:48:46.495 --> 02:48:47.215]  We gotta stop that.
[02:48:47.455 --> 02:48:48.596]  There's no more Uniparty.
[02:48:48.616 --> 02:48:50.357]  The Uniparty is kaput.
[02:48:50.818 --> 02:48:51.598]  They're on their heels.
[02:48:51.758 --> 02:48:52.899]  It's das kaput.
[02:48:52.919 --> 02:48:53.760]  And we're building a new system.
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:54.980]  And there's a new system coming.
[02:48:55.421 --> 02:48:56.442]  And that's what they're afraid of.
[02:48:57.262 --> 02:48:58.042]  That's what they're afraid of.
[02:48:58.062 --> 02:48:58.643]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:58.663 --> 02:48:59.883]  All right, Colonel, you're amazing.
[02:48:59.923 --> 02:49:05.045]  Hey, promise me, if you were here a year and a half ago and didn't get your number, promise me you'll come in here on a more routine basis.
[02:49:05.625 --> 02:49:06.025]  It's a deal.
[02:49:06.305 --> 02:49:07.246]  I love your dog, by the way.
[02:49:07.386 --> 02:49:07.946]  Yeah, Joseph.
[02:49:08.186 --> 02:49:08.826]  He's a war hero.
[02:49:08.866 --> 02:49:10.047]  Where are you going after this?
[02:49:10.067 --> 02:49:10.807]  You've got a lot going on.
[02:49:10.927 --> 02:49:12.888]  Yeah, we'll be back down there in Dripping Springs.
[02:49:12.908 --> 02:49:17.430]  We're going to take a run real quick to the border and back, and then we'll link up with the folks on the first.
[02:49:18.150 --> 02:49:23.952]  All right, DrPeterChambers.com on X. Dr. Pete Chambers, thank you so much, sir.
[02:49:24.252 --> 02:49:25.293]  Yes, sir.
[02:49:25.313 --> 02:49:26.173]  20-second closing comment.
[02:49:26.803 --> 02:49:28.384]  Twenty-second closing comment.
[02:49:28.504 --> 02:49:29.344]  Normandy D-Day.
[02:49:29.584 --> 02:49:36.267]  Colonel George Taylor got on the shore and said, men, there's only two kinds of soldiers on this beach, the dead and those who will die.
[02:49:36.407 --> 02:49:36.827]  Follow me.
[02:49:36.887 --> 02:49:37.227]  Let's go.
[02:49:37.287 --> 02:49:37.787]  And they moved.
[02:49:38.687 --> 02:49:39.268]  That's where we're at.
[02:49:40.808 --> 02:49:41.368]  Powerful.
[02:49:41.769 --> 02:49:42.029]  All right.
[02:49:42.069 --> 02:49:44.990]  Fourth hour coming up with a great guest host, Owen Schroer.
[02:49:45.010 --> 02:49:45.290]  3 p.m.
[02:49:45.310 --> 02:49:45.950]  in one hour.
[02:49:46.330 --> 02:49:48.151]  Infowars.com.
[02:49:48.531 --> 02:49:49.832]  We're not lying down, folks.
[02:49:49.872 --> 02:49:50.712]  We're fighting back.
[02:49:51.092 --> 02:49:52.473]  And it's all because of your support.
[02:49:52.513 --> 02:49:53.593]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:49:53.993 --> 02:49:54.873]  Hour number four.
[02:49:54.954 --> 02:49:55.474]  Straight ahead.
[02:49:55.514 --> 02:49:55.994]  Stay with us.
[02:49:56.912 --> 02:49:57.733]  Winter is coming.
[02:50:00.818 --> 02:50:01.579]  Winter is coming.
[02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:02.961]  Winter is coming!
[02:50:03.999 --> 02:50:05.480]  Winter is coming.

[02:50:57.958 --> 02:51:01.006]  I'm Kate Dalley, your guest host from katedalleyradio.com.
[02:51:01.046 --> 02:51:02.349]  So good to be with you today.
[02:51:02.369 --> 02:51:03.131]  I hope you're doing well.
[02:51:04.375 --> 02:51:10.000]  Two things, I have, well, I obviously have a wonderful guest and you're going to want to hear every single thing he says.
[02:51:10.360 --> 02:51:12.542]  But I just wanted to say two things about the headlines.
[02:51:13.043 --> 02:51:18.428]  Go back for the last two years and look at all the headlines, Biden versus Trump, okay?
[02:51:18.808 --> 02:51:20.590]  You're going to see all the headlines.
[02:51:20.770 --> 02:51:23.352]  It was this match from the very beginning.
[02:51:23.873 --> 02:51:26.535]  There's no surprise what's going on right now in the headlines.
[02:51:27.576 --> 02:51:29.498]  Go look for all the articles, you'll find them.
[02:51:30.343 --> 02:51:32.683]  From Washington Post to CNN.
[02:51:33.164 --> 02:51:37.424]  Yeah, anyway, two horrible news outlets.
[02:51:37.544 --> 02:51:38.724]  Also, they don't want you to fly.
[02:51:39.045 --> 02:51:41.365]  Three articles yesterday creating the fear of flying.
[02:51:42.405 --> 02:51:48.686]  If I were you, I mean, I'm making a concerted effort not to fly United, Delta, American or Virgin.
[02:51:49.246 --> 02:51:52.987]  I think that notorious for false flags.
[02:51:53.207 --> 02:51:59.168]  I think those airlines, those keep coming up and I would just say maybe stay away from those ones.
[02:51:59.508 --> 02:52:00.449]  That would be my personal.
[02:52:00.709 --> 02:52:01.810]  I mean, you can do what you want.
[02:52:02.291 --> 02:52:04.533]  I just think they're creating a fear of flying.
[02:52:04.673 --> 02:52:05.494]  So for a reason.
[02:52:06.055 --> 02:52:06.455]  All right.
[02:52:07.056 --> 02:52:16.125]  Mel Madison is a writer and financial services veteran, a fintech executive, leveraging over 20 years experience in the realm of high finance.
[02:52:16.865 --> 02:52:25.668]  And brings this real world authenticity to fictional narratives that one of them is coming out right now called Quaz.
[02:52:26.108 --> 02:52:27.529]  You're going to want to check this book out.
[02:52:27.929 --> 02:52:28.189]  Why?
[02:52:28.469 --> 02:52:31.470]  Because this guy knows his history.
[02:52:32.271 --> 02:52:35.832]  He understands where all of this is headed with digital currency.
[02:52:36.292 --> 02:53:00.016]   And today we're going to talk about the fact that the deep economic state, sorry, the BIS, The Bank of International Settlements and the endgame of CBDC digital currency and two different systems they'll be operating, one for them, one for us, you know, the peons, and just a healthy dose of economic realism.
[02:53:00.036 --> 02:53:07.601]  And he quotes Thomas Jefferson, as he wrote over 200 years ago, banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies.
[02:53:08.321 --> 02:53:09.982]  I 100% agree.
[02:53:10.342 --> 02:53:12.244]  Welcome to the show, Mel Madison.
[02:53:12.284 --> 02:53:12.664]  How are you?
[02:53:14.185 --> 02:53:15.386]  I am doing fabulous.
[02:53:15.426 --> 02:53:16.206]  Thanks for having me.
[02:53:17.247 --> 02:53:18.507]  I'm so glad you're on with me.
[02:53:18.647 --> 02:53:20.048]  You're a wealth of information.
[02:53:20.328 --> 02:53:25.070]  So I am just going to let you talk about what is happening right now.
[02:53:25.370 --> 02:53:28.032]  But I want to start with the deep economic state.
[02:53:28.072 --> 02:53:30.133]  I think this is a really good place to start.
[02:53:30.233 --> 02:53:34.615]  You cover a lot of this in your novel, which I highly recommend.
[02:53:35.215 --> 02:53:36.716]  You can go and order it right now.
[02:53:36.736 --> 02:53:37.436]  It is QUOZ.
[02:53:39.677 --> 02:53:50.210]  You might want to tell people why the name, first off, because this delves into banking, what's coming, what you saw during COVID, what's really happening.
[02:53:50.511 --> 02:53:51.492]  Why the name Quaz?
[02:53:53.219 --> 02:53:53.540]  Sure.
[02:53:53.700 --> 02:54:08.294]  So Quaz has a little bit to do with a part in the book area where a AI supercomputer that is being operated by a powerful and shadowy organization that we're going to get into today.
[02:54:08.414 --> 02:54:10.356]  It's called the Bank for International Settlements.
[02:54:10.616 --> 02:54:12.078]  Not a lot of people have heard about it.
[02:54:12.638 --> 02:54:15.001]  It is the central bank for central banks.
[02:54:15.721 --> 02:54:25.964]  It has a long and storied history as financiers of the Third Reich, enablers of Hitler, and I hope we're getting to all of that.
[02:54:26.064 --> 02:54:40.689]  But to answer your question about Quas, you know, there's a quantum computer, and it's heated in a green or cooled in a super cool chamber that's kind of got this eerie green glow, and it's reminiscent of the Emerald City.
[02:54:40.709 --> 02:54:44.630]  And I call it a Quantum Oz or Quas.
[02:54:44.930 --> 02:54:58.116]   But What really drove me to stick with that as a device in the novel was also my love and reading of Frank Baum's classic, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.
[02:54:58.217 --> 02:55:00.298]  And I'm not talking about the 1939 movie, but the earlier book.
[02:55:02.826 --> 02:55:20.531]  Uh that came out that the movie was based on and and that book what a lot of people don't understand is that there have been currency crises that date back to the beginning of formation of this country we could talk about the continental currency which was a fiat currency to fund the revolution or the greenbacks that that Lincoln did.
[02:55:21.131 --> 02:55:23.332]  And how those led to disaster and inflation.
[02:55:23.392 --> 02:55:30.977]  But there was currency crises going on in the turn of the century and Baum was trying to encapsulate that in The Wizard of Oz.
[02:55:31.097 --> 02:55:36.820]  And he had the way back home was through the Yellow Brick Road and Dorothy's silver shoes.
[02:55:36.920 --> 02:55:38.381]  They weren't ruby slippers in the book.
[02:55:38.401 --> 02:55:40.162]  So I'm going to stop you there.
[02:55:40.222 --> 02:55:41.323]  We're going to come right back.
[02:55:41.403 --> 02:55:42.683]  We have so much time.
[02:55:42.703 --> 02:55:44.004]  You're going to want to stay glued to this.
[02:55:44.344 --> 02:55:45.205]  Trust me on this one.
[02:55:45.285 --> 02:55:46.005]  He knows this stuff.
[02:55:46.045 --> 02:55:46.926]  We'll be right back.
[02:55:47.586 --> 02:55:48.347]  How did things end?
[02:55:48.447 --> 02:55:49.909]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:50.169 --> 02:55:51.791]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:51.892 --> 02:55:53.433]  My guest, Mel Madison.
[02:55:53.794 --> 02:55:54.975]  The book, Quaz.
[02:55:55.376 --> 02:55:56.437]  Q-U-O-Z.
[02:55:57.138 --> 02:55:59.201]  You can go to melmadison.com.
[02:55:59.241 --> 02:56:00.863]  It's M-A-T-T-I-S-O-N.
[02:56:00.883 --> 02:56:01.043]  Okay?
[02:56:03.593 --> 02:56:05.055]  You're going to learn so much in this hour.
[02:56:05.335 --> 02:56:07.517]  I'm excited, actually, to have you listen to him.
[02:56:08.498 --> 02:56:12.602]  So let's go back to Frank Baum, the author of Wizard of Oz.
[02:56:12.622 --> 02:56:14.524]  You were just getting into that.
[02:56:14.584 --> 02:56:19.169]  And then I want to ask you about the real purpose of the central banks.
[02:56:20.810 --> 02:56:21.651]  Yes, exactly.
[02:56:23.250 --> 02:56:35.122]  This is a not well-known story of our time, but there were riots and protests in the streets that were going on, you know, at the turn of the century around currency and around money.
[02:56:35.502 --> 02:56:44.471]  And it was eerily reminiscent of what we're looking at today, where the government wanted to take away the people's money, right, and reinstitute a new system.
[02:56:45.291 --> 02:56:53.661]  And at the time, the people really used silver, and silver was embedded early on as a currency of the United States.
[02:56:53.881 --> 02:56:57.706]  It's a term called bimetallism, you know, gold and silver.
[02:56:58.704 --> 02:57:02.264]   the bankers had gold had the gold and the people had the silver and
[02:57:02.264 --> 02:57:08.854]   There is an act passed in 1873 I think it's the the coinage act of 1873 that
[02:57:08.854 --> 02:57:14.864]   essentially outlawed silver as money And it was known as the crime of 73 and it was to move us
[02:57:14.864 --> 02:57:17.985]   all onto a gold standard only
[02:57:17.985 --> 02:57:24.024]   That whereby the bankers were the ones who were holding the gold and people were using silver which was money
[02:57:24.024 --> 02:57:30.354]   and they didn't want the people having that money and You know William Jennings Bryan did his famous cross of
[02:57:30.354 --> 02:57:34.564]   gold speech do not you know nail us to this cross of gold and take away
[02:57:34.564 --> 02:57:41.024]   Way the money and this this led to panic this led to trouble in the economy
[02:57:41.024 --> 02:57:45.625]   Which ultimately led to the 1913 passage of the Federal Reserve Act?
[02:57:45.625 --> 02:57:51.264]   so all of these things these currency crises that lead to the development of central banks and how
[02:57:51.504 --> 02:57:58.975]   The government does what they have been doing for hundreds of years which is finding ways to siphon the wealth of the
[02:57:58.975 --> 02:58:02.645]   people Into the coffers of the government so that they then have a
[02:58:02.645 --> 02:58:06.894]   population Dependent on them that must sell their labor that must do
[02:58:06.894 --> 02:58:09.927]   what they say And it's all the same stuff happening.
[02:58:10.307 --> 02:58:14.811]  It's just, you know, history doesn't repeat it rhymes, but it's rhyming really strong right now.
[02:58:16.607 --> 02:58:33.335]  So the book title is named after Oz and bringing all of this history into that novel and also touch briefly on the regulatory role and let's focus on the manipulation of money to the economy, how they manipulate it even right now.
[02:58:34.998 --> 02:58:35.519]  Exactly.
[02:58:35.599 --> 02:58:42.647]  So what would help everybody I think understand the rest of the conversation is just to understand what is the purpose of a central bank.
[02:58:42.827 --> 02:58:48.013]  So there's one purpose that they tell you about and there's another purpose of why they were originally created.
[02:58:48.074 --> 02:58:52.158]  What was the impetus to create an organization called a central bank?
[02:58:52.419 --> 02:59:01.558]   And It goes back to 1694, and William III, the King of England at the time, had gone broke fighting foreign wars.
[02:59:02.119 --> 02:59:12.508]  And not only had he gone broke, but he had taken on so much debt from creditors that he defaulted on some of that debt, and people would not loan him any money.
[02:59:12.568 --> 02:59:15.010]  The rich banking families would not loan him any money.
[02:59:15.590 --> 02:59:20.794]  And so he taxed and he taxed and he taxed until the taxes got so high that he couldn't tax anymore.
[02:59:20.814 --> 02:59:23.776]  And there was no gold that he could get his hands on.
[02:59:23.816 --> 02:59:25.017]  He wanted to build a fleet.
[02:59:25.097 --> 02:59:30.280]  He needed 1.5 million pounds to build a fleet to go to go fight France.
[02:59:30.921 --> 02:59:33.923]  And so they came up with this idea called a central bank.
[02:59:34.223 --> 02:59:40.127]  And this was the formation of the Bank of England, upon which all modern central banks are based, including the Federal Reserve.
[02:59:40.922 --> 02:59:49.132]  And the system is get money from the people through the central bank by the central bank takes the people's gold gives it to the government.
[02:59:49.855 --> 02:59:52.456]  And then the government uses it for what they want.
[02:59:52.596 --> 02:59:55.317]  And in return, the central bank starts creating paper money.
[02:59:55.877 --> 02:59:58.858]  And this is the introduction of paper British pound notes.
[02:59:59.519 --> 03:00:04.240]  And this is what was happening in this country with the creation of the Federal Reserve.
[03:00:04.440 --> 03:00:08.482]  And it was the exact same thing until we went off of the gold standard in 71.
[03:00:08.722 --> 03:00:13.023]  And it started becoming more and more blatant and unstoppable.
[03:00:13.083 --> 03:00:36.185]   But they still have found ways To get the central bank to be essentially a money printing machine for the government and everybody knows that that's what they do they print money for the government and the situation that we're getting to right now and what this is leading to and it's like the music starting to slow in the musical chairs is first they're able to keep a charade up of a gold standard and there.
[03:00:37.226 --> 03:00:43.634]  That collapses then then they're saying, well, we have a manageable amount of fiat money, but now even that is collapsing.
[03:00:43.794 --> 03:00:49.821]  And the way that's collapsing is so much of it is needing to be printed that you're starting to get serious inflation.
[03:00:50.081 --> 03:00:54.427]  And I think we're just in a period of maybe a little low right now where it's coming down.
[03:00:55.027 --> 03:01:15.018]  But in the end, and we'll probably get into this later, but within 10 years, the $200 trillion plus in entitlement funding that is unpaid for, the amount of debt and spending is going to get so high that we could be heading for a necessary economic showdown, revolution, Bretton Woods 2.0 type situation.
[03:01:15.317 --> 03:01:21.977]   where the entire economic system needs to be overturned in order for them to institute their plans of
[03:01:21.977 --> 03:01:29.617]   control and chaos and how they can once again impoverish the people and set up the cycle all over again.
[03:01:29.617 --> 03:01:34.817]  Who owns the Fed, the Federal Reserve?
[03:01:34.817 --> 03:01:41.387]   Yeah, so they, the central banks, whether you're talking about Bank of England or you're talking about the Federal
[03:01:41.387 --> 03:01:43.897]   Reserve today, they're owned by the member banks.
[03:01:43.718 --> 03:01:48.261]  And this system is really set up to serve the banking cartels and the financial elites.
[03:01:48.922 --> 03:02:03.143]   And so a lot of people, they'll say, oh no, the Federal Reserve, it's technically, it might be separate from the government, but They do when they get interest on the debt that they own, they do pay that back to the government treasury.
[03:02:03.603 --> 03:02:11.931]  But what they're looking at when they're doing that is they're just looking at the face of the Federal Reserve, which is the Board of Governors and federal employees like Jerome Powell.
[03:02:12.391 --> 03:02:15.494]  And they're not looking beyond that to the 12 member banks.
[03:02:15.594 --> 03:02:15.755]  So.
[03:02:16.355 --> 03:02:23.440]  You know, people, when you look at a bill that you have, there's always a little circle on there with a letter and a name of a city.
[03:02:23.620 --> 03:02:24.681]  And it could be Richmond.
[03:02:25.201 --> 03:02:26.021]  It could be Dallas.
[03:02:26.082 --> 03:02:27.102]  It could be San Francisco.
[03:02:27.162 --> 03:02:27.963]  It could be New York.
[03:02:28.003 --> 03:02:30.745]  Take a look at the next time you actually have physical cash in your hands.
[03:02:31.305 --> 03:02:35.047]  And you'll see that it actually doesn't come from the Federal Reserve in Washington.
[03:02:35.688 --> 03:02:38.730]  It comes from one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks.
[03:02:39.560 --> 03:02:43.923]  And these banks are not owned by the government, they're owned by the member banks.
[03:02:43.983 --> 03:02:48.245]  And if I could just briefly read a two sentence quote.
[03:02:48.285 --> 03:02:51.507]  This comes directly from the Federal Reserve of St.
[03:02:51.326 --> 03:02:54.326]  St. Louis, one of the 12's website.
[03:02:54.326 --> 03:03:02.326]   While the Board of Governors of the Fed, the Federal Reserve Banks, these 12 regional banks,
[03:03:02.326 --> 03:03:05.326]  are set up like private corporations.
[03:03:05.326 --> 03:03:10.326]   Member banks, that's commercial banks, that's the Goldman Sachs, that's whoever.
[03:03:10.326 --> 03:03:15.326]   Member banks hold stock in the Federal Reserve Banks and earn dividends.
[03:03:15.326 --> 03:03:17.326]  So who owns our central bank?
[03:03:17.326 --> 03:03:19.326]  It's the member banks.
[03:03:19.495 --> 03:03:24.438]  The bank for international settlements, the thing that's not really talked about a lot.
[03:03:24.277 --> 03:03:29.317]   capitalism, institution serves the owners. So they're not here to serve the people,
[03:03:29.317 --> 03:03:33.317]  they're here to serve the banking cartel.
[03:03:33.317 --> 03:03:38.237]   The Bank for International Settlements, the thing that's not really talked about
[03:03:38.237 --> 03:03:41.636]   a lot, we talk about Federal Reserve but we don't, and we mention it, but we don't
[03:03:41.636 --> 03:03:47.877]   really talk about the BIS, which is huge in this in this situation, right?
[03:03:47.877 --> 03:03:52.677]   Yeah, the Bank for International Settlements, and this goes for
[03:03:52.677 --> 03:03:57.557]   everything I'm saying. It's not stuff that you need to find written on the
[03:03:57.557 --> 03:04:00.837]  back of an envelope somewhere.
[03:03:58.948 --> 03:04:06.774]  They couch it in fancy terms, they bury it in 25-page white papers or somewhere on their website, but they admit all of this.
[03:04:06.814 --> 03:04:11.338]  The central bank for central banks is the Bank for International Settlements.
[03:04:11.718 --> 03:04:13.540]  It's based in Basel, Switzerland.
[03:04:14.287 --> 03:04:22.312]  Its members are the central banks of the world, 63 of them, encompassing over 95% of global GDP.
[03:04:22.852 --> 03:04:29.096]  And every two months, the leaders of the central banks fly to Basel to have secret clandestine meetings.
[03:04:29.376 --> 03:04:31.757]  They refuse to allow media coverage.
[03:04:31.817 --> 03:04:33.438]  They refuse to release minutes.
[03:04:33.858 --> 03:04:38.561]  They refuse to discuss anything of what they go and discuss in these two-day meetings.
[03:04:38.641 --> 03:04:40.122]  And this is the big shots.
[03:04:40.182 --> 03:04:42.684]  This is Powell from the Fed.
[03:04:43.644 --> 03:04:46.191]  This is the they whenever we're talking about they.
[03:04:46.391 --> 03:04:46.592]  Okay.
[03:04:47.515 --> 03:04:50.357]  This is the days, Christine Lagarde of the ECB.
[03:04:51.017 --> 03:05:00.562]  And the other day is the people that are owning these Federal Reserve member banks, which you can look at, say, the Richmond Fed and you see who's on the board of directors.
[03:05:00.682 --> 03:05:02.083]  Oh, it's the CEO of Siemens.
[03:05:02.544 --> 03:05:03.844]  Oh, what did she do prior to that?
[03:05:03.964 --> 03:05:12.569]  Oh, she worked for Lockheed Martin or she ran, you know, so it's defense contractors and their names are there and they're public and that's who they are.
[03:05:13.049 --> 03:05:15.391]  And I think it's great to get into.
[03:05:16.767 --> 03:05:20.750]  I did a show here on Siemens because Siemens is a big name and we never hear about it.
[03:05:20.790 --> 03:05:23.912]  They were heavily involved with the Nazi regime.
[03:05:24.532 --> 03:05:28.715]  They pretty much are dealing with all of our trains and outfitting all of our trains here.
[03:05:29.636 --> 03:05:33.218]  They get huge government contracts and also health care as well.
[03:05:33.879 --> 03:05:38.142]  They're in our health care, and I wouldn't call it health care, it's more like genocide, but they're involved.
[03:05:38.562 --> 03:05:38.942]  Siemens.
[03:05:39.302 --> 03:05:41.303]  Be right back more with Mel Madison.
[03:05:41.483 --> 03:05:43.024]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:05:43.064 --> 03:05:46.966]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com, The Kate Dally Show.
[03:05:47.026 --> 03:05:47.987]  So happy to be with you.
[03:05:48.007 --> 03:05:49.687]  You deserve to have a great day.
[03:05:49.928 --> 03:06:01.333]  And also this information really needs to be ingested today so that we understand what's happening on the monetary front coming in over the next decade, which we're going to talk about with Mel Madison.
[03:06:01.373 --> 03:06:02.193]  What is the end game?
[03:06:02.214 --> 03:06:02.954]  We're going to get to that.
[03:06:03.434 --> 03:06:05.796]  I wanted you to expand just a little bit more.
[03:06:05.976 --> 03:06:09.819]  MelMattison.com, M-A-T-T-I-S-O-N.
[03:06:10.460 --> 03:06:12.561]  You can also get his book, Quaz, that's coming out.
[03:06:12.581 --> 03:06:19.487]  It delves into a lot of details about the things we're going to be talking about today, so you have a really clear understanding of what we're up against.
[03:06:20.127 --> 03:06:26.210]  And how they're going to play this system against us in the matter of control, which we all know is coming.
[03:06:26.231 --> 03:06:29.292]  We've talked about this, but there's so much more to understand too.
[03:06:30.273 --> 03:06:39.478]  And so a little bit more on the BIS, the Bank of International Settlements that never gets talked about, the blueprint for the future monetary system.
[03:06:39.598 --> 03:06:40.898]  We need to talk about that too.
[03:06:40.999 --> 03:06:43.500]  And you could preface that with a little more history if you want to, Mel.
[03:06:46.573 --> 03:06:47.594]  A little bit of history.
[03:06:47.654 --> 03:06:53.336]  I don't want to get too much into it, but it's just kind of some fascinating stuff of this Bank for International Settlements.
[03:06:53.917 --> 03:06:54.597]  It was started in 1930.
[03:06:54.717 --> 03:07:05.262]  It was created to facilitate reparations payments from the Germans to the Allied victors of World War I. And that quickly ended.
[03:07:05.722 --> 03:07:07.003]  The Depression happened.
[03:07:07.543 --> 03:07:12.086]  The collapse around the world of economic systems began in the 1930s.
[03:07:13.505 --> 03:07:16.327]  And the reparation payments only lasted for one more year.
[03:07:16.387 --> 03:07:17.107]  So the B.I.S.
[03:07:17.147 --> 03:07:19.909]  was searching for a mission, searching for something.
[03:07:20.569 --> 03:07:24.331]  And their role as the International Central Bank for Central Banks began to emerge.
[03:07:24.712 --> 03:07:38.700]  And what they did was throughout not only the buildup of the Third Reich, but then during the war, was they acted as the conduit for all of these international banking cartels to continue to do what they needed to do.
[03:07:39.280 --> 03:07:42.562]  So it was a conduit from Wall Street into the Third Reich.
[03:07:43.217 --> 03:07:55.440]  To build the roads, funnel the Nazi war machine, and then once the Third Reich actually went into action, they facilitated the economic takeovers that the Third Reich wanted to accomplish.
[03:07:55.460 --> 03:08:00.002]  So one quick example of that was when Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia.
[03:08:00.682 --> 03:08:08.484]  Czechoslovakia's central bank had left their gold, big mistake here, in the safekeeping of the Bank for International Settlements.
[03:08:09.153 --> 03:08:24.543]  The Bank for International Settlements, after Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia, basically Hitler sent in henchmen to the head of the Czechoslovakian Central Bank and said, order the BIS to release the gold to us.
[03:08:25.284 --> 03:08:29.286]  And, you know, people in America were shocked by this, but the BIS did it.
[03:08:29.947 --> 03:08:38.813]  The BIS literally took their gold, which was being held on behalf of the BIS underneath the Bank of England.
[03:08:39.489 --> 03:08:58.855]  And through more gold swaps through all of their, you know, international gold web that they had at this time, took gold reserves that were in Amsterdam, they did some bookkeeping entries on the Bank for International Settlements, and they loaded up the trucks and they shipped the Czechoslovakian gold to Berlin.
[03:08:59.315 --> 03:09:04.236]  And so even as Hitler was invading countries, World War Two is getting started.
[03:09:04.657 --> 03:09:09.058]  This bank is enabling the Third Reich's buildup and playing both sides of the coin.
[03:09:09.731 --> 03:09:11.972]  So, this is who we're dealing with here.
[03:09:12.092 --> 03:09:22.318]  You had a guy on the Board of Directors there that was the guy in charge of all gold confiscation from the Jews and from concentration camps, from people's teeth.
[03:09:22.658 --> 03:09:24.919]  These are the people that have served on the Board of Directors.
[03:09:24.999 --> 03:09:26.740]  And this institution still exists.
[03:09:27.575 --> 03:09:32.377]  And this is the institution that Jerome Powell goes to every two months.
[03:09:32.938 --> 03:09:40.061]  And five of the directors, I believe it was, that were there were eventually tried for war crimes.
[03:09:40.721 --> 03:09:44.843]  And surprise, surprise, there were pardons, there were appeals.
[03:09:45.904 --> 03:09:51.306]  These are people that were instrumental in providing the money for the Third Reich.
[03:09:51.747 --> 03:09:54.268]  And they got like two years probation.
[03:09:54.992 --> 03:10:00.936]  I mean, you can't write this stuff, and this is the organization.
[03:10:01.477 --> 03:10:06.460]  At the Bretton Woods Conference, the Americans were like, we've got to dismantle this thing.
[03:10:06.500 --> 03:10:13.225]  The people in the government that knew what the Bank of International Settlements had done, they knew about their connections with John Foster Dulles.
[03:10:15.266 --> 03:10:19.269]  His brother had been the attorney for the Bank of International Settlements in New York.
[03:10:19.369 --> 03:10:23.612]  They knew the CIA had been setting up shop next to the BIS during the war.
[03:10:23.712 --> 03:10:27.075]  All these connections were there.
[03:10:27.275 --> 03:10:30.757]  Some people that were representing America at Bretton Woods said, we got to dismantle it.
[03:10:30.777 --> 03:10:31.678]  We got to take it down.
[03:10:32.398 --> 03:10:36.682]  And somehow, three years later, mysteriously, those plans were revoked.
[03:10:36.922 --> 03:10:38.583]  It was agreed to at Bretton Woods.
[03:10:39.421 --> 03:10:45.943]  Everything at Bretton Woods that they said they were going to do, they did, except for one thing, which was dismantle and tear down the bank for international settlements.
[03:10:47.903 --> 03:10:51.564]  It's interesting, you know, you look back on the media, they never talk about it, they never mention it.
[03:10:51.604 --> 03:10:56.745]  I mean, mainstream media is bought and sold, we all know it, just more evidence of that, because it never gets talked about.
[03:10:57.585 --> 03:11:07.988]  So they spelled out their plans for the tokenization, the digitization, right, of not only money, but also of assets.
[03:11:09.935 --> 03:11:15.141]  Exactly so this is where it leads us to today they are at the forefront so.
[03:11:16.283 --> 03:11:28.978]  We don't want to get too technical but there needs to be payment rails there needs to be central to central bank communications there needs to be this whole huge infrastructure set up to put in the new global central bank digital currency regime.
[03:11:29.680 --> 03:11:32.583]  And the Bank for International Settlements are the ones that are doing it.
[03:11:33.004 --> 03:11:37.428]  They're the ones that put out like, you know, a 25 page white paper.
[03:11:38.309 --> 03:11:39.690]  You know, what's the title of this?
[03:11:39.790 --> 03:11:42.033]  Blueprint for the Future Monetary System.
[03:11:42.533 --> 03:11:44.835]  Improving the old, enabling the new.
[03:11:44.996 --> 03:11:54.900]   And this is where they spell out their plans of not how, not only do they want central bank digital currencies, But they want the tokenization of assets.
[03:11:55.261 --> 03:12:06.613]  They want to take who actually owns your car and turn it into a Web3 blockchain software line of code so that, you know, they want to repossess a car.
[03:12:06.633 --> 03:12:07.714]  They want to repossess a car.
[03:12:08.014 --> 03:12:09.176]  Guess who's going to own your gun?
[03:12:09.196 --> 03:12:10.537]  You're not going to own your gun.
[03:12:10.557 --> 03:12:13.961]  It will be on the unified ledger of a central bank somewhere.
[03:12:14.521 --> 03:12:38.697]  As the actual owner of these things and so this is all part of their plans and just really quickly the last bit of historical thing before we get into the day is after World War Two they continue to do what they wanted to do and Germans continue to be instrumental and the big three parts of the Nazi plan for Europe economically after World War Two was one we need to get rid of borders for trade.
[03:12:38.998 --> 03:12:43.841]  Two we need to have a common currency and three this needs to be run out of Germany.
[03:12:44.341 --> 03:12:45.241]  What do we have today?
[03:12:45.261 --> 03:12:46.122]  The Euro.
[03:12:46.362 --> 03:12:47.782]  They're the ones who put it in place.
[03:12:48.822 --> 03:12:56.645]  The ECB, the European Central Bank, had their offices in the headquarters of the Bank for International Settlement in Basel until they moved to where?
[03:12:56.965 --> 03:13:03.107]  Frankfurt, Germany, home of the Rothschild banking clan, where Merrill Rothschild himself started the whole thing.
[03:13:03.727 --> 03:13:15.432]   And now today, the central bank, the main economic power in Europe, Is the European Central Bank headquartered in Frankfurt with one common currency and the borders are gone?
[03:13:15.812 --> 03:13:19.494]  The Third Reich's economic plan put into action through the BIS.
[03:13:20.814 --> 03:13:24.476]  Today, that first step of what they did in Europe is...
[03:13:29.351 --> 03:13:34.614]  And they're going to do this by utilizing, as they always do, the technology that they have.
[03:13:34.794 --> 03:13:36.975]  And so that's where we're at today.
[03:13:36.995 --> 03:13:38.976]  You know, we can take this wherever you want.
[03:13:39.836 --> 03:13:44.898]  But the tokenization... Yeah, yeah.
[03:13:44.958 --> 03:13:48.500]  A lot of these companies... They're all from Germany.
[03:13:49.300 --> 03:13:50.821]  Everything originates in Germany.
[03:13:51.779 --> 03:13:54.061]  Um, and it is, it is kind of amazing.
[03:13:54.401 --> 03:13:56.602]  Um, um, so we're going to come back.
[03:13:56.622 --> 03:14:01.405]  We'll talk about the tokenization and this also goes along with that plan.
[03:14:01.725 --> 03:14:08.670]  Um, the drill that they did where they take everybody's stuff in an economic collapse and they let you off of payments for a solid year.
[03:14:08.690 --> 03:14:10.511]  They did this, uh, October ago.
[03:14:11.011 --> 03:14:15.434]  And then when you want your stuff back, so everybody goes, yay, we have a free year of no payments.
[03:14:15.554 --> 03:14:18.216]  But when you want your stuff back, you have to go into digitalization.
[03:14:18.993 --> 03:14:21.356]  We'll be right back more with the great Mel Madison.
[03:14:21.376 --> 03:14:23.499]  The book is Quaz, Q-U-O-Z.
[03:14:23.519 --> 03:14:25.982]  Be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:14:26.662 --> 03:14:30.807]  You know, I stood up here and I yell and scream about the New World Order and the globalists.
[03:14:30.827 --> 03:14:36.014]  They're planning to get rid of the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab and you saw it all come true.
[03:14:37.135 --> 03:14:39.766]   But there's a Inverse of that.
[03:14:40.526 --> 03:14:45.510]  There's not just the bad stuff I'm telling you about, there's the good stuff I'm telling you about.

[03:15:27.571 --> 03:15:28.892]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[03:15:29.172 --> 03:15:31.074]  My guest is Mel Madison.
[03:15:31.294 --> 03:15:32.294]  Mel Madison.
[03:15:32.335 --> 03:15:35.497]  I'm saying it with T's, so you understand it's M-A-T-T-I-S-O-N.
[03:15:36.097 --> 03:15:38.539]  MelMadison.com and the book is Qua.
[03:15:38.579 --> 03:15:39.960]  So grateful to have you here.
[03:15:41.181 --> 03:15:43.182]  And we're going to get into more of the end game.
[03:15:43.442 --> 03:15:49.887]  I also want to ask you, was COVID also cover for the financial looting that was going on?
[03:15:49.907 --> 03:15:51.088]  I mean, complete cover.
[03:15:51.648 --> 03:15:53.889]  Dry run through whatever it was, we'll get to that too.
[03:15:54.389 --> 03:16:17.980]  Let's talk about Bitcoin because when I was talking with you, a question arose actually from my co-host that said, you know, was Bitcoin just actually installed just to make us comfortable with this, profiteering off of this, because that's why it has an anonymous owner, still unknown creator of Bitcoin, but they shoved this out to gain some trust.
[03:16:20.131 --> 03:16:36.298]  Yes, so Satoshi Nakamoto is just this name that somehow is out there in the ether based upon a white paper that showed up, you know, whenever that was 2008 or 10, when Bitcoin came along.
[03:16:36.338 --> 03:16:40.300]  And he, and I'm using the term he, but we don't know who he is.
[03:16:40.400 --> 03:16:41.581]  Is he the CIA?
[03:16:41.661 --> 03:17:02.561]   Is he Part of this international banking group and other industrial complex, the economic industrial complex, the military, the groups that align, the groups that value the most or gain the most value when they siphon off the money from the people and funnel it into their corporations and their banks.
[03:17:03.161 --> 03:17:06.704]  So, my personal thought on Bitcoin is I don't know.
[03:17:06.724 --> 03:17:08.605]  It could be legitimate.
[03:17:09.166 --> 03:17:10.326]  I have to be honest about that.
[03:17:10.407 --> 03:17:15.290]  It could be as legitimate, I mean, it could be a random person.
[03:17:15.310 --> 03:17:17.011]  It could also be a psy-op.
[03:17:17.071 --> 03:17:22.716]  It could be designed to have a backdoor and create a collapse and fall apart in 2030.
[03:17:22.776 --> 03:17:24.977]  We just don't really know enough about it.
[03:17:26.653 --> 03:17:47.442]  And related to that, though, and getting people used to this digital currency, this digital digitization of money, it flows into what they want to do next, which is the tokenization of assets, they call it, where they use the term, the process of representing claims digitally on a programmable platform.
[03:17:47.622 --> 03:17:54.785]   And by programmable, what they mean is that they can turn it on, they can turn it off, They can foster their own D.I.
[03:17:54.845 --> 03:18:11.614]  initiatives they can they can create limits on how much money you're spending on guns or ammo or fossil fuels or whatever they like or don't like it's a mechanism for social controls and so all of this it is a decent civilization it's a training.
[03:18:12.534 --> 03:18:31.447]  And there are things out there as well in the digital front like stable coins that represent a threat to this entire economic system that they're also trying to get ahead of by the release of a two-tier CBDC system, which keeps the commercial banks still at the center of power and money.
[03:18:31.707 --> 03:18:34.749]  And that's the main reason I think CBDCs are coming.
[03:18:36.252 --> 03:18:42.695]  Ah, so I was mentioning a drill where I think this was 2022, October, where the government did a drill.
[03:18:43.036 --> 03:18:45.617]  And what they did was it was an economic collapse drill.
[03:18:46.237 --> 03:18:52.600]  And they told people, okay, you get to go for up to a year without any payments on any of your stuff.
[03:18:52.700 --> 03:19:06.654]   And so of course, when people are given something like that little break, They were cheering for that and this was an exciting thing and a great thing, but then when you wanted your stuff and you actually want to go and finish off paying off your stuff, which everybody has loans out, right?
[03:19:07.429 --> 03:19:08.230]  And all kinds of things.
[03:19:08.670 --> 03:19:15.257]  Then they push you into this type of currency in order to get your stuff back so that you're not without your stuff.
[03:19:15.437 --> 03:19:17.159]  So it was just a way.
[03:19:17.339 --> 03:19:20.202]  So do you figure something like that would happen?
[03:19:20.262 --> 03:19:30.412]  Would it come in a thousand cuts or does it come where it's a conjured up depression like we had before where it's a dive off the cliff kind of thing?
[03:19:32.590 --> 03:19:35.192]  So, I think you're exactly right.
[03:19:35.212 --> 03:19:41.058]  I think that whenever, you know, beware of Greeks bearing gifts, right?
[03:19:41.198 --> 03:19:54.851]   So, whenever the government is giving you stimulus checks, or they're talking about things like universal basic income, or they're giving you a break from interest payments, They're great packagers.
[03:19:55.051 --> 03:19:56.832]  They're great at rapping.
[03:19:57.633 --> 03:19:59.414]  They know how to play us.
[03:19:59.454 --> 03:20:01.756]  We're like a violin to them.
[03:20:02.056 --> 03:20:05.598]  Stratus Varius, he's the maker, I guess he probably played too.
[03:20:05.818 --> 03:20:07.199]  They know what they're doing.
[03:20:07.420 --> 03:20:08.881]  This is not their first rodeo.
[03:20:09.741 --> 03:20:16.866]  This is not a group of bumbling fools who have no idea about human nature or how people react to things.
[03:20:17.686 --> 03:20:24.840]   I think that They know they need a way to suck people in, and things always look better on the face of it.
[03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:28.821]  And then they've got you right where they want you, and then they can spring their trap.
[03:20:29.201 --> 03:20:43.905]  And it will be like that with CBDCs, where they'll talk all this game about privacy, and how it's just going to be so amazing for you, and you're going to be able to get direct money from the government through universal income.
[03:20:44.185 --> 03:21:00.576]   And, you know, the same thing with COVID, you've mentioned a couple times, like, The purpose of the COVID and how that all worked, whether it was created for this purpose or when it showed up because it came out of the lab or whatever happened with it, they used it as an opportunity.
[03:21:00.976 --> 03:21:15.207]  It became what in military terms would be called a feint or a probing act or a reconnaissance in force, where the general doesn't want to send the whole army because if it doesn't work right with this battle plan, then he loses his whole army.
[03:21:15.247 --> 03:21:20.510]   So he does it on a smaller A micro version first before the macro version comes.
[03:21:20.691 --> 03:21:27.814]  And COVID acted as this microcosm for what happens when we shut people down?
[03:21:28.014 --> 03:21:30.575]  What happens when we start forcing shots on the people?
[03:21:30.655 --> 03:21:33.437]  What happens when we start telling people they can't leave their homes?
[03:21:34.297 --> 03:21:44.322]   What happens when you start setting up Get people used to these types of types of dependencies.
[03:21:44.382 --> 03:21:45.363]  How is the reaction?
[03:21:45.643 --> 03:21:50.126]  And then they see reactions and they see, you know, different looting or they see different protests.
[03:21:50.486 --> 03:22:00.973]  And now they understand that when we when this comes out on a bigger scale, when the things really start happening, now they understand where the strengths, where the weaknesses, what do they need to do.
[03:22:01.374 --> 03:22:04.336]  So you can look at it as the prep, the dry run.
[03:22:04.876 --> 03:22:13.622]  As they do their final preparations for what they know is coming which is the a relative collapse of the economic system.
[03:22:14.202 --> 03:22:20.266]  Because it simply cannot go on anymore and it's the weakness is showing up the inflation that came.
[03:22:21.193 --> 03:22:24.535]  Uh, the way they raised interest rates, and then they had to stop raising it.
[03:22:25.255 --> 03:22:32.518]  And what they know is that these things are coming to an end because of the debts that are already on the books.
[03:22:32.678 --> 03:22:33.279]  There's nothing.
[03:22:33.619 --> 03:22:35.000]  Budget battles don't matter.
[03:22:35.480 --> 03:22:37.961]  How much money we're going to spend in 2024 doesn't matter.
[03:22:38.401 --> 03:22:41.042]  What matters is we've already committed to spending over $200 trillion.
[03:22:42.883 --> 03:22:51.869]  Not the $34 trillion you hear about debt, but if you look at the big thing where the money goes, it's Social Security and it's Medicare payments.
[03:22:52.350 --> 03:22:53.730]  We maxed out in 2020.
[03:22:53.891 --> 03:22:58.153]  We hit a peak and we're just declining, declining, declining.
[03:22:58.794 --> 03:23:03.177]  The Congressional Budget Office puts out all the figures and it's going to be empty in 2033.
[03:23:03.217 --> 03:23:26.219]   As we lead up to that, As we start hitting twenty twenty nine twenty thirty and people realize wow they really do have to either cut my social security or they have to take it away or they have to jack up social security taxes to unseen levels or medicare and then the other spending is still there and all the government programs.
[03:23:26.779 --> 03:23:30.323]  And they start releasing this massive debt that the economy can't handle anymore.
[03:23:30.724 --> 03:23:35.709]  That's when they need to do their bread and woods 2.0 economic calamity.
[03:23:36.170 --> 03:23:39.894]  Every dollar you have is going to be worth 10 cents or 50 cents on the dollar.
[03:23:39.914 --> 03:23:47.322]  And they're going to start issuing a new currency and they're already going to have the system in place to do it by then.
[03:23:47.822 --> 03:23:50.765]  Which is the digital central bank, so there's nothing you can do about it.
[03:23:51.165 --> 03:23:52.566]  There's not a paper note out there.
[03:23:52.586 --> 03:24:03.716]  There's not a bank you can go to, and they have the mechanism all in place to do a complete reboot of the economic system and skew everything in their favor once again.
[03:24:05.501 --> 03:24:11.225]  The reason you know these things is because you're a student of history, and they don't change the playbook very often.
[03:24:11.285 --> 03:24:15.007]  And like you said with COVID, they wanted to search out the weaknesses.
[03:24:15.067 --> 03:24:31.856]   They were probably gauging how many people revolted, how many people protested, what section of the population, what percentage Did not get the shots, and I think they faked the numbers for the boosters, because after the first shot, people weren't getting a lot of the boosters, and I actually think they faked the numbers for the original shot.
[03:24:31.936 --> 03:24:33.396]  Nobody wanted what they were selling.
[03:24:33.756 --> 03:24:35.737]  Not nobody, but a big portion of the people.
[03:24:36.097 --> 03:24:37.598]  But they will fudge those numbers too.
[03:24:38.038 --> 03:24:53.702]   When we come back, I want to talk a little bit more about the future, about what's coming, and you noted too that the World Economic Forum was really talking about how these CBDCs Could be used to limit purchases like you said of just
[03:24:53.702 --> 03:24:58.813]   about everything so you get to the grocery store You've harmed the climate too much. You can't buy said
[03:24:58.813 --> 03:25:02.361]   groceries, or you can't get said fuel those types of things are coming
[03:25:02.361 --> 03:25:07.161]   Be right back on the Alex Jones show more with Mel Madison dot com.
[03:25:07.241 --> 03:25:08.883]  Mel Madison of the book Quaz.
[03:25:09.183 --> 03:25:11.025]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:25:11.085 --> 03:25:14.368]  My guest, Mel Madison of melmadison.com.
[03:25:14.508 --> 03:25:18.973]  And of course, the book coming out this month is called Quaz.
[03:25:19.253 --> 03:25:30.598]   It's a book talking about how AI, how How the CBDC, everything collides, everything intersects, a lot of history also, and you'll love this book.
[03:25:31.118 --> 03:25:37.180]  So we had the cash dilemma that happened to this little dry run in India.
[03:25:38.020 --> 03:25:46.622]  Then we had Nigeria, and you might want to talk about that for just a second, and people were handed the CBDCs as a solution, right?
[03:25:46.662 --> 03:25:52.198]   So talk about that, because people may not take their horrid shots, but they will take Money.
[03:25:52.459 --> 03:25:55.181]  And that's our problem is that we need to get out of debt.
[03:25:55.241 --> 03:25:57.583]  We need to do all of these things to combat this.
[03:25:57.903 --> 03:26:00.666]  But there was some good news that came out of Nigeria.
[03:26:00.766 --> 03:26:01.766]  Talk about Nigeria.
[03:26:02.007 --> 03:26:10.234]  OK, so Nigeria was again, you know, they they this isn't their first rodeo.
[03:26:10.294 --> 03:26:11.254]  They do feints.
[03:26:11.435 --> 03:26:13.216]  They do reconnaissance and force.
[03:26:13.276 --> 03:26:18.320]  And so the CBDC rollout in Nigeria was one of those.
[03:26:18.621 --> 03:26:29.030]   And Nigeria is a Large economy, the largest, excuse me, in Africa, over 200 million people, rich in natural resources and oil.
[03:26:29.050 --> 03:26:32.813]  And they were hard hit by inflation.
[03:26:33.213 --> 03:26:38.117]  Obviously, the Nigerian Central Bank with their currency, the Naira, was getting out of control.
[03:26:38.217 --> 03:26:42.501]  People were starting to use bitcoins and alternative sources of payment.
[03:26:43.001 --> 03:26:53.590]   And so they said to themselves, I believe, I don't know, because I don't know what they talked about at the BIS, but This would be the perfect type of an action that gets planned in secret at the BIS.
[03:26:53.930 --> 03:26:58.814]  Let's see what Nigeria does when we force CBDC on the people there.
[03:26:59.514 --> 03:27:02.577]  And they had their way figured out to do it.
[03:27:02.737 --> 03:27:11.363]  They said, we have too much counterfeiting, too much paper money being forged, and we're going to issue all new paper money.
[03:27:11.643 --> 03:27:17.428]  And everybody in the country, you need to turn in your paper money and we'll give you this new form of paper money.
[03:27:17.948 --> 03:27:19.990]  And that old form is no longer valid.
[03:27:20.530 --> 03:27:27.155]  And so the people turned in the old form, but instead of getting the new form of money, which they wanted, they went to the banks.
[03:27:27.175 --> 03:27:28.096]  They went to the ATMs.
[03:27:28.116 --> 03:27:28.716]  Where's our money?
[03:27:28.756 --> 03:27:29.497]  They didn't get it.
[03:27:29.977 --> 03:27:35.721]  But the Bank of Nigeria said, we can give you the e-Naira, the CBDC.
[03:27:36.082 --> 03:27:38.203]  And the people of Nigeria revolted.
[03:27:38.223 --> 03:27:39.304]  They didn't want it.
[03:27:39.544 --> 03:27:40.825]  They took to the streets.
[03:27:41.566 --> 03:27:43.187]  Fortunately, people were killed.
[03:27:43.546 --> 03:27:49.026]   But it led to new leadership. It led to a new president who actually
[03:27:49.026 --> 03:27:54.465]   Went and arrested and took the head of the Nigerian Central Bank away in handcuffs
[03:27:54.465 --> 03:27:59.666]   He went from the ivory tower in Basel to a Nigerian prison cell and in and you know
[03:27:59.666 --> 03:28:04.892]   This these are the actions that are happening This isn't, you know, some made-up story of what's going on.
[03:28:05.253 --> 03:28:18.267]  This is what is going on out there in the world right now, but you didn't hear a lot about it or any of it on the mainstream news because the last thing that they want to start broadcasting is a story about the people taking power back and central bankers going to prison.
[03:28:19.699 --> 03:28:40.137]  So you could see a time then when people would be told to hand in their dollar bills, their 20s, their 100s, whatever the currency may be, but they might give back $25,000 in CBDC as a little gift from the government so that you feel really good about handing in that cash because you're going to score some more money, right?
[03:28:40.157 --> 03:28:42.179]  Because you've got to give freebies when you're doing this.
[03:28:42.239 --> 03:28:42.920]  People will take them.
[03:28:44.826 --> 03:28:45.306]  Exactly.
[03:28:45.366 --> 03:28:47.247]  They will have one way or the other.
[03:28:47.847 --> 03:28:51.588]  It could be exactly like you said, to encourage adoption.
[03:28:52.088 --> 03:28:56.110]  We're going to give you 120 cents on the dollar of CBDCs.
[03:28:56.170 --> 03:28:58.490]  And people say, well, I don't really want to do it.
[03:28:59.090 --> 03:29:08.813]  But if I can use a CBDC through my bank to buy my groceries and I'm going to have $120 to do it, well, I guess I will.
[03:29:09.594 --> 03:29:14.829]   Or they're going to say, Look, we're going to give a new round of stimulus checks like they did.
[03:29:15.270 --> 03:29:21.534]  But in order to get it, you need to go online or go on your smartphone and create a central bank digital wallet.
[03:29:21.954 --> 03:29:43.978]   And you need to start, you know, putting in your bio codes or your fingerprints and your eyes or whatever they need to make this happen where they can then start easing you in to having all of your life, all of your money coming through this app on your phone that's operated by You know, Federal Reserve System, and that's where the money is, and it goes through the commercial banks.
[03:29:44.318 --> 03:29:47.060]  So they're gonna, you got to keep your eyes out.
[03:29:47.100 --> 03:29:48.841]  That's what InfoWars does, right?
[03:29:48.901 --> 03:29:55.186]  And it tells the people about what the globalists are planning and where they're coming from and what to keep a lookout for.
[03:29:55.766 --> 03:30:00.289]  And these are the things that are going to start happening where they're going to start, you know, priming the pump.
[03:30:01.676 --> 03:30:01.816]  Yep.
[03:30:02.016 --> 03:30:03.998]  You would buy gold and silver.
[03:30:05.219 --> 03:30:08.943]  Maybe create a bartering system within a community of people that you live by.
[03:30:09.423 --> 03:30:11.145]  Shop at your local farmers.
[03:30:11.285 --> 03:30:12.886]  Don't be eating petri dish meat.
[03:30:13.607 --> 03:30:18.291]  Don't give in to a lot of these plans because we could foil a lot of this as a people.
[03:30:18.512 --> 03:30:21.034]  We don't have to do what they want us to do.
[03:30:21.094 --> 03:30:22.075]  They're going to entice us.
[03:30:22.095 --> 03:30:22.996]  They're going to bribe us.
[03:30:23.396 --> 03:30:27.300]  Be out of debt because debt is the way that they wrangle you into this hot mess.
[03:30:27.720 --> 03:30:29.022]  But there are things you can do.
[03:30:29.082 --> 03:30:33.289]  What else would you do besides for maybe owning rentals or rental companies?
[03:30:33.309 --> 03:30:36.293]  Because that seems to be Klaus Schwab's way of the future if they get their way.
[03:30:36.654 --> 03:30:39.038]  What else would you do to sort of prepare?
[03:30:39.591 --> 03:30:39.951]  Yes.
[03:30:40.311 --> 03:30:48.276]  So I do think that, you know, talking a second about like some of those ideas, but there's one thing too about the people.
[03:30:48.336 --> 03:31:00.944]  The people are learning, you know, they are confronting something that they didn't have to confront in 1694, which is venues such as this where people can get the word out of what's really going on.
[03:31:01.044 --> 03:31:05.046]  And you're starting to see it in Europe where they're farther ahead on this.
[03:31:05.207 --> 03:31:09.049]  And I always look to the European Central Bank to see what the Fed might be doing next.
[03:31:09.787 --> 03:31:12.108]  The people are revolting against it.
[03:31:12.328 --> 03:31:20.772]  So you can actually look at, you know, percentage of transactions handed digitally or through a credit card in certain European countries.
[03:31:21.472 --> 03:31:25.954]  And the amount that are going back to using digital or paper euros has skyrocketed.
[03:31:25.974 --> 03:31:36.358]  There are countries in Europe where only 50 percent of transactions are handed digitally and they're still doing half of their transactions in cash, which is not even close to what we do here in the United States.
[03:31:37.078 --> 03:31:42.521]   And what I find very And you know which countries do this?
[03:31:43.122 --> 03:31:43.983]  What are the countries?
[03:31:44.063 --> 03:31:45.025]  Well, guess what?
[03:31:45.245 --> 03:31:47.668]  It's Germany, it's Austria, it's Switzerland.
[03:31:47.988 --> 03:31:56.399]  The ones who stay the most away from this banking cartel and systems are the ones closest to the seat of power.
[03:31:58.502 --> 03:31:59.743]  They're the ones who understand it.
[03:32:00.063 --> 03:32:01.004]  They're the ones who understand it.
[03:32:01.324 --> 03:32:02.605]  Look at what they're doing.
[03:32:02.786 --> 03:32:04.447]  Look at what the central banks are doing.
[03:32:04.768 --> 03:32:06.049]  They're stopping buying U.S.
[03:32:06.109 --> 03:32:07.710]  debt and they're starting to buy gold.
[03:32:07.770 --> 03:32:09.512]  This is publicly available information.
[03:32:09.552 --> 03:32:10.473]  You can look at a chart.
[03:32:10.813 --> 03:32:13.136]  You know, central bank purchases of U.S.
[03:32:13.196 --> 03:32:15.358]  debt goes down like a ski slope.
[03:32:15.778 --> 03:32:21.762]  Central bank purchases of gold goes up like a mountain and and these so the central banks are buying gold.
[03:32:21.862 --> 03:32:46.136]   They're de-dollarizing they call it and they the people that live in these countries that are closest to this nexus of international economic power that they're the ones that are you know I mean there's a reason why the Swiss have such secret banks because they know you can't trust banks you know I mean this is where this all comes from and and so You know, what people can do.
[03:32:47.287 --> 03:32:48.428]  There's two currencies, right?
[03:32:48.468 --> 03:32:57.092]  They'll have their own while we're given this whole blockchain on the lie that this is all about transparency because you know fraud.
[03:32:57.112 --> 03:32:59.834]  Because they did the same thing in India too when they ended cash overnight.
[03:32:59.854 --> 03:33:01.134]  It was all about fraud, right?
[03:33:01.175 --> 03:33:01.855]  Stopping fraud.
[03:33:02.235 --> 03:33:03.976]  And so there's two currencies real quick.
[03:33:04.276 --> 03:33:05.097]  One they'll use.
[03:33:05.637 --> 03:33:10.239]  One we are going to be using that actually is kind of chipped just like you'd mark a bill.
[03:33:10.540 --> 03:33:11.720]  But what are the two kinds?
[03:33:11.760 --> 03:33:12.240]  Wholesale?
[03:33:12.781 --> 03:33:13.421]  What was the other one?
[03:33:13.461 --> 03:33:14.902]  Wholesale and retail.
[03:33:15.742 --> 03:33:16.583]  Wholesale and retail.
[03:33:17.583 --> 03:33:39.581]  Choose two completely separate systems and the reason for that is that they need it to go through the commercial banks so that the central banks which are owned by the commercial banks that kind of more real money if you will it's all funny money in a way but the more real money will be the wholesale money which is only to be used between banks and between banks and central banks.
[03:33:40.220 --> 03:33:48.963]  And then you and I, you know, the plebs, we get the retail version of the CBDC and what this allows them to do.
[03:33:49.223 --> 03:33:57.606]  And we don't have time to get into it, but it allows them to continue their fractional reserve banking system of printing money and creating money through debt.
[03:33:58.186 --> 03:34:02.288]  And so all the money we have to keep our retail CBDCs with the banks.
[03:34:02.788 --> 03:34:27.467]  So that the real transactions behind the scenes can go through on the wholesale and and that way the banks can hold our retail and they can use it to buy government debt and then they can take that money that they hold as debt and they can loan it out and they can create more and more layers of fraudulent money so that they can artificially say, oh, our GDP has gone up four or five times since World War Two.
[03:34:28.388 --> 03:34:30.730]  Uh, our economy is growing at four percent.
[03:34:30.931 --> 03:34:42.565]  All these things when in reality we've seen what has happened to the standard of living since World War Two, where someone with a high school diploma could buy a house, support his or her family, and send their kids to a safe school.
[03:34:42.986 --> 03:34:46.510]  And now two parents can't do it running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[03:34:49.176 --> 03:34:51.417]  Oh, there's so many more places we could go on this.
[03:34:51.477 --> 03:34:57.739]  I'll have to have you back for a second hour because there's so much involved with what the plans are, and it's not like they're shy about it.
[03:34:57.859 --> 03:34:59.440]  They print a lot of this stuff out.
[03:34:59.460 --> 03:35:03.541]  You just have to know how to look for it, where to look, and also who's saying it.
[03:35:03.922 --> 03:35:05.702]  And like you said, keep your eyes on Germany.
[03:35:05.762 --> 03:35:06.583]  What are they doing?
[03:35:06.643 --> 03:35:08.503]  Because there's a lot of tells being given.
[03:35:08.944 --> 03:35:10.804]  Mel Madison, thank you.
[03:35:10.824 --> 03:35:11.805]  I really appreciate you.
[03:35:11.825 --> 03:35:12.865]  The book is called Quas.
[03:35:12.905 --> 03:35:13.265]  Go get it.
[03:35:13.285 --> 03:35:14.626]  It goes into a lot more detail.
[03:35:14.646 --> 03:35:15.226]  You'll love it.
[03:35:16.002 --> 03:35:18.103]  And I'm Kate Dally for the Alex Jones Show.
[03:35:18.143 --> 03:35:21.165]  Really appreciate you listening in and appreciate the information, Mel.
[03:35:21.445 --> 03:35:21.765]  Thank you.
[03:35:21.825 --> 03:35:22.206]  Thank you.
[03:35:22.906 --> 03:35:25.147]  I actually feel sorry for the establishment.
[03:35:26.128 --> 03:35:26.968]  They're inbred.
[03:35:27.129 --> 03:35:28.509]  They were given the power they have.
[03:35:28.609 --> 03:35:29.710]  They're incompetent scum.
[03:35:30.150 --> 03:35:30.931]  Look at Lloyd Austin.
[03:35:31.831 --> 03:35:37.074]  And I remember when they stole the election in 2020.
[03:35:37.254 --> 03:35:41.757]  They told us we should never question another election again.
[03:35:42.437 --> 03:35:45.019]  But isn't that all Democrats have ever done?
[03:35:46.949 --> 03:35:50.250]  And isn't that what Hillary Clinton claimed Trump was going to do in 2020?
[03:35:51.370 --> 03:35:54.070]  She did that because she was butthurt.
[03:35:55.251 --> 03:36:10.053]  She did that because they printed up hundreds of thousands of copies of this Newsweek edition, factual magazine framed in here, with her, the supposed 45th president of the United States.
[03:36:10.574 --> 03:36:12.314]  These people are a joke.
[03:36:13.444 --> 03:36:16.986]  They still think corporate media is important.
[03:36:17.006 --> 03:36:19.487]  Let's show folks an overhead shot of that.
[03:36:20.828 --> 03:36:24.250]  They still think being in the New York Times or on CNN is important.
[03:36:24.931 --> 03:36:27.132]  CNN has an average of 100,000 viewers.
[03:36:27.832 --> 03:36:29.093]  Their top show has 100,000.
[03:36:29.413 --> 03:36:33.956]  Joe Rogan has 30, 40, 50 million viewers a week conservatively.
[03:36:34.276 --> 03:36:34.776]  So do we.
[03:36:36.897 --> 03:36:46.056]   But why do we still see them, even myself, at some levels as The establishment as the top of the game.
[03:36:46.296 --> 03:36:46.716]  They're not.
[03:36:46.796 --> 03:36:47.557]  They're a joke.
[03:36:48.097 --> 03:36:48.757]  They're a fraud.
[03:36:49.397 --> 03:36:54.659]  Before I shot this report, I saw this Time Magazine article.
[03:36:54.719 --> 03:36:55.819]  Who reads Time Magazine?
[03:36:56.140 --> 03:36:56.840]  Who looks at this?
[03:36:56.860 --> 03:36:57.440]  Who believes this?
[03:36:57.860 --> 03:37:03.002]  I bet the Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, will show a close shot of that.
[03:37:03.022 --> 03:37:05.943]  I bet he has this framed on his wall.
[03:37:07.301 --> 03:37:10.323]  The last place I'd want to be is on the cover of Time Magazine.
[03:37:10.663 --> 03:37:13.765]  It means you're an establishment loser or worse.
[03:37:14.706 --> 03:37:17.007]  The last place I want to be is in a Hollywood movie.
[03:37:17.327 --> 03:37:19.008]  The power structure is a joke.
[03:37:19.168 --> 03:37:19.709]  It's over.
[03:37:20.069 --> 03:37:20.629]  It's a fraud.
[03:37:20.649 --> 03:37:21.170]  So look at this.
[03:37:22.130 --> 03:37:27.834]  Just like they're trying to hold up Blinken, they tried to hold up Hillary Clinton.
[03:37:28.815 --> 03:37:33.317]  So I remind myself and I remind you of what a joke and what a fraud they are.
[03:37:34.038 --> 03:37:37.340]  And the fact that all their attempts to silence us and to silence you have failed.
[03:37:37.680 --> 03:37:41.202]  And now the whole world is listening to what we're doing.
[03:37:41.822 --> 03:37:46.044]  And that credit goes to God and God through you, the viewers and listeners.
[03:37:46.464 --> 03:37:48.405]  You deserve the credit for this broadcast.
[03:37:48.886 --> 03:37:50.987]  You deserve the credit for what we've been able to do.
[03:37:51.487 --> 03:37:54.849]  But I want to encourage you to remember how important you are.
[03:37:55.856 --> 03:38:00.800]  And that we're starting to win, but if you don't support the broadcast, we can fail.
[03:38:02.101 --> 03:38:03.002]  I need your support.
[03:38:03.182 --> 03:38:05.124]  I've got so many great plans we can execute.
[03:38:05.204 --> 03:38:06.885]  I've proven I'm in the game.
[03:38:06.926 --> 03:38:07.666]  I don't back down.
[03:38:07.886 --> 03:38:09.288]  We have victory in a bottle.
[03:38:09.548 --> 03:38:10.148]  Thanks to God.
[03:38:10.228 --> 03:38:10.969]  Thanks to your support.
