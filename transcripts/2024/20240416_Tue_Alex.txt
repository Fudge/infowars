[00:00:11.798 --> 00:00:28.994]  What we've tried to do over the years is to use the expertise, the resources, to allow us to respond better to a deliberate affront or attack on us with a microbe of any type, engineered or what have you.
[00:00:29.694 --> 00:00:34.398]  To use that knowledge to better prepare us for what we know will happen.
[00:00:34.738 --> 00:00:48.848]  Instead of looking at it in two separate silos of biodefense for biological threats that are deliberate and countermeasures for naturally occurring, you should essentially pool the science so that you could do both.
[00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:57.595]  At least 15 federal agencies knew that gain-of-function research was being done in the Wuhan lab since, what, 2018?
[00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:04.723]  We've gotten all of our information from Whistleblower, but we now know it wasn't just one agency that China was approaching.
[00:01:05.124 --> 00:01:14.055]  China made a presentation, or an American representative, Peter Daszak, made a representation to 15 agencies about creating a virus that, guess what?
[00:01:14.435 --> 00:01:20.359]  Looks suspiciously like COVID-19 and looks like no other virus in nature from that family.
[00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.842]  They were working on this and presented it to 15 agencies.
[00:01:24.282 --> 00:01:31.927]  And in 2020, when they saw COVID-19, they should have all been calling and raising the alarm and saying, my goodness, we saw this two years ago.
[00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:33.408]  We knew the Chinese were doing this.
[00:01:33.728 --> 00:01:35.029]  Lo and behold, they did it.
[00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.372]  A brave Marine, a lieutenant colonel, came forward and gave us that information.
[00:01:39.452 --> 00:01:41.614]  Or today, we would still not know any of this.
[00:01:41.894 --> 00:01:48.919]  The great COVID cover-up, shocking truth about Wuhan and 16 federal agencies.
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.022]  Yeah, Senator, they were lying.
[00:01:52.502 --> 00:02:02.010]  And the lying had real consequences for children, their mental health, their education, for business, for our faith, not being able to go to houses of worship.
[00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.572]  I mean, that's fundamental American freedoms.
[00:02:05.172 --> 00:02:09.736]  And I'll ask you again, what should the consequences be for Anthony Fauci?
[00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:11.232]  Jail.
[00:02:11.672 --> 00:02:14.195]  You know, I've sent two referrals to the Department of Justice.
[00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:16.498]  I think he lied to Congress, which is a felony.
[00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:18.941]  Anthony Fauci did lie to Congress.
[00:02:19.382 --> 00:02:20.784]  We know that from his own words.
[00:02:20.844 --> 00:02:24.028]  Not because I say he lies, but his private emails say he was lying.
[00:02:24.068 --> 00:02:25.830]  Virtually everything he said in private
[00:02:26.471 --> 00:02:28.051]  Contradicted what he was saying in public.
[00:02:28.372 --> 00:02:30.132]  And he was fairly honest in private.
[00:02:30.152 --> 00:02:31.693]  In private he said masks don't work.
[00:02:32.093 --> 00:02:34.193]  In public he wore three masks.
[00:02:34.413 --> 00:02:38.855]  In private he admitted that there was such a thing as natural immunity gained from getting the infection.
[00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:41.715]  In public he was like, you know, we're not going to measure that.
[00:02:41.755 --> 00:02:42.696]  It's unpredictable.
[00:02:43.076 --> 00:02:44.276]  And what are they talking about?
[00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:46.017]  They're talking about this.
[00:02:47.372 --> 00:02:49.193]  The New York Post is finally covering it.
[00:02:49.473 --> 00:02:54.356]  Three years ago, a lot of these emails were already public, but now even more emails are public.
[00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:57.858]  Whistleblower shares more COVID origin emails.
[00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.820]  Fauci advisor allegedly concealed on private account house panel.
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.801]  We had emails in late 2020.
[00:03:04.581 --> 00:03:09.184]  So over three years ago, we've covered it ad nauseam from the EcoHealth Alliance.
[00:03:10.144 --> 00:03:14.507]  And a lot of that is because what Dr. Huff, who was the vice president of it,
[00:03:15.478 --> 00:03:28.055]  ...was giving it to Tom Renz and others, and later testified to Congress and others, that they were developing COVID-19 for the CIA and the Defense Department, and they were developing the vaccine before they ever released COVID.
[00:03:28.976 --> 00:03:29.056]  Yeah.
[00:03:50.325 --> 00:03:59.231]  If it doesn't get exposed fully, if people aren't brought to justice, they've now beta-tested launching an even more deadly virus and even more deadly injection in the future.
[00:03:59.271 --> 00:04:02.212]  This is a test to see if they can depopulate.
[00:04:02.413 --> 00:04:07.896]  These shots order the body to mass-produce the HIV spike protein.
[00:04:08.216 --> 00:04:15.481]  We knew in January of 2020, because the Indian major university, the CRISPR gene editing system,
[00:04:16.221 --> 00:04:20.747]  And they scanned the damn virus and said it was from five viruses man-made.
[00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:24.090]  And then later it was confirmed by all these other governments and institutions.
[00:04:24.591 --> 00:04:26.854]  In the literature, it is a fact.
[00:04:27.655 --> 00:04:29.076]  In peer-reviewed studies, it's man-made.
[00:04:29.176 --> 00:04:30.378]  It is a fact.
[00:04:30.438 --> 00:04:32.240]  It's got a big rhino horn on it.
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.462]  The biggest spike protein ever seen is HIV.
[00:04:35.433 --> 00:04:38.855]  That literally goes and plugs into the cell with a big spike.
[00:04:39.015 --> 00:04:44.478]  You're literally looking in that movie of what they're describing as an alien attacking of an HIV virus.
[00:04:44.918 --> 00:04:47.179]  So, that's the spike protein, folks.
[00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:53.102]  And it's very, very, very frustrating to sit here and watch all this unfolding.
[00:05:00.856 --> 00:05:02.318]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is back.
[00:05:02.538 --> 00:05:10.066]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, the platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulas, has returned to InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:06:11.724 --> 00:06:18.026]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:36.852]  We've got another incredibly powerful transmission lined up for you today on this Tuesday, April 16th, 2024 transmission.
[00:06:37.292 --> 00:06:39.673]  We're now 30 years and counting on air.
[00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.801]  202 days, 12 hours, 53 minutes, 28 seconds.
[00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:46.664]  The most important election in world history.
[00:06:48.465 --> 00:07:04.538]  You know, I was thinking this morning, driving into the InfoWars News Center here in Austin, Texas, about the fact that 95% of what we predicted would happen 30 years ago, 25 years ago is when I was really informed, 20 years ago, has all come true.
[00:07:06.035 --> 00:07:17.121]  I was wet behind the ears 30 years ago, but still more informed than the general public, but I've learned a lot in the process of being fully immersed in research and history and current events and geopolitical systems and different power elites.
[00:07:21.263 --> 00:07:26.546]  But it hit me that we don't have 30 years now to turn this around.
[00:07:26.626 --> 00:07:27.387]  We've got a few years.
[00:07:28.407 --> 00:07:30.629]  Because we're not in the beta testing of the New World Order.
[00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:33.010]  We are deep into its operational phase.
[00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.631]  And I know I've talked a lot about that, but
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:53.366]  Last night, this morning, when I was getting ready for the show, because I'm basically always researching, unless I take a little time off with the family for dinner or to go swimming or hike or whatever, but I'm researching five, six, seven, eight hours a day, that the globalists really are at war with the people.
[00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:59.828]  And I know we talk about that a lot, but when you really look at what they're doing,
[00:08:01.513 --> 00:08:03.274]  They're at war with humanity.
[00:08:03.334 --> 00:08:04.434]  They're at war with stability.
[00:08:04.834 --> 00:08:06.114]  They're at war with themselves.
[00:08:06.134 --> 00:08:09.795]  They're even working against their own interest in the final equation.
[00:08:10.576 --> 00:08:13.096]  They really are coming to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:08:13.737 --> 00:08:19.198]  And today I was just looking at the developments and each one of these we could do the entire show on.
[00:08:20.679 --> 00:08:28.861]  Now Julian Assange's brother is joining us in the second hour to talk about not just trying to get Julian Assange out of prison,
[00:08:30.213 --> 00:08:41.403]  To stop the solitary confinement torture, but also his amazing legacy so far and how the man is a hero who should be hoisted on our shoulders, not in a dungeon.
[00:08:41.423 --> 00:08:44.686]  So we're gonna review some of the big stories.
[00:08:44.726 --> 00:08:45.707]  WikiLeaks is broken.
[00:08:48.509 --> 00:08:55.596]  The lies about WMDs, the torture, the pedophilia of the Democratic Party.
[00:08:57.442 --> 00:09:04.465]  All of that coming up with his brother today and then Biden signaling that he may drop the charges.
[00:09:04.946 --> 00:09:06.746]  One of the biggest failures of Trump not doing that.
[00:09:08.007 --> 00:09:12.009]  So that is coming up in the second hour.
[00:09:12.149 --> 00:09:16.771]  And I've been targeted by the same groups.
[00:09:17.151 --> 00:09:19.932]  I've not gone through one tenth, hell, not one
[00:09:22.583 --> 00:09:25.704]  100th really of what Julian has done.
[00:09:26.344 --> 00:09:48.008]  I've been in solitary confinement twice when I was a teenager because no matter who started the fight when the police show up and somebody's in an ambulance with blood coming out of their ears and in a coma you go to jail until you get a court date and I've been in solitary confinement for two weeks and I absolutely hated it.
[00:09:49.068 --> 00:09:49.608]  It was horrible.
[00:09:50.369 --> 00:09:51.689]  I would be allowed out every
[00:09:54.827 --> 00:10:07.570]  Both times in Dallas, in juvenile, every two to three days to take a ten minute shower, and they would have guards standing around me the whole time, because again, I was violent.
[00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.830]  And they just had the police reports there.
[00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:12.611]  And I mean, I get it.
[00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:15.431]  I was a savage, and I'm not even proud of it.
[00:10:16.252 --> 00:10:16.932]  But that's what happens.
[00:10:16.972 --> 00:10:20.453]  But Julian Assange has done none of this.
[00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:22.273]  And it all started when he had sex.
[00:10:23.424 --> 00:10:30.791]  With two CIA sex operatives, they admitted it was consensual, but the condom broke, so it's rape.
[00:10:33.013 --> 00:10:40.240]  And I can't tell you how many times they put sex operatives on me when I'm at a restaurant or a bar on a trip.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.243]  This happens almost every time, and I just look at them and I say, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
[00:10:45.259 --> 00:10:47.980]  It's always graduate, you know, PhD type women.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.320]  They're 30 years old.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.400]  They think they're super hot.
[00:10:50.981 --> 00:10:52.441]  They come over, tell you how great you are.
[00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:53.741]  Let's go to your hotel room right now.
[00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:57.262]  And I look up and I say, take the CIA and go jump in a lake.
[00:10:57.803 --> 00:11:02.924]  And they turn red and shake their heads as if I can't tell what's going on.
[00:11:04.344 --> 00:11:07.925]  So that's his only crime was thinking with his little head and not his big one.
[00:11:09.126 --> 00:11:09.726]  And for that,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.982]  He's been in self-imposed and then actual solitary now for six years, and it's wrong.
[00:11:18.342 --> 00:11:19.883]  So that's coming up in the second hour.
[00:11:22.303 --> 00:11:26.325]  The Trump first criminal trial is incredible.
[00:11:27.105 --> 00:11:37.568]  I mean, if you think all the other show trials and civil trials and fake rape trials and his real estate trial, where there was no jury, though he requested one, is bad.
[00:11:37.868 --> 00:11:40.789]  This new one takes the cake.
[00:11:41.696 --> 00:11:56.784]  In that they're charging him with election interference in 2016 with money to Stormy Daniels, reportedly.
[00:11:59.965 --> 00:12:06.869]  But they're the ones election meddling, saying he can't leave for two weeks to two months.
[00:12:07.029 --> 00:12:08.750]  They won't say how long the judge is going to have it last.
[00:12:10.208 --> 00:12:14.630]  And so he's not allowed to go to the Supreme Court for his immunity case next week.
[00:12:15.631 --> 00:12:18.752]  He can't go to his son's high school graduation.
[00:12:20.293 --> 00:12:21.894]  He's pinned down in New York.
[00:12:22.374 --> 00:12:27.417]  And then when he walks out and attacks the judge, which everybody knows of the Constitution's your right to say the judge is a fraud.
[00:12:27.817 --> 00:12:28.397]  I'm innocent.
[00:12:29.057 --> 00:12:30.718]  They're all over the news attacking him.
[00:12:30.738 --> 00:12:34.060]  They're now moving for contempt of court.
[00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:36.071]  Against Trump.
[00:12:36.991 --> 00:12:47.479]  So that is just spectacular Orwellville, where exactly what they're doing to him, they claim he's on trial for.
[00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:49.860]  Spectacular.
[00:12:50.281 --> 00:12:51.041]  We're going to hit that.
[00:12:53.063 --> 00:12:54.063]  Got to stack on that.
[00:12:55.644 --> 00:13:00.808]  Then I've known about this, and before I clicked on it this morning at like 6 a.m.
[00:13:00.828 --> 00:13:04.431]  when I was doing research, I thought, okay, I already know all this.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:12.885]  But thank God, Dr. Phil, who I think is a great guy, he's exposing transgender cult, all of it, the open border, you name it.
[00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:14.826]  He's really stepping up.
[00:13:15.026 --> 00:13:15.787]  I've always liked him.
[00:13:16.807 --> 00:13:18.949]  Compared to anything on corporate media, he's about as good as it gets.
[00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:24.272]  I watched a two-minute clip and I went, well, I better find the full thing.
[00:13:24.312 --> 00:13:25.793]  So I went and found large excerpts.
[00:13:26.694 --> 00:13:30.457]  And I knew a lot of this, but I hadn't thought about it in a while.
[00:13:30.497 --> 00:13:32.698]  And I was kind of mad at myself for not making a bigger deal about it.
[00:13:34.319 --> 00:13:35.200]  Because they've built
[00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:44.053]  More than 20 secret communist Chinese military bases run by communist generals.
[00:13:44.113 --> 00:13:46.095]  And when I say secret, it's not been in the news.
[00:13:46.135 --> 00:13:52.600]  I mean, we've covered it, but it's hiding in plain view with 700-foot observation towers.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:59.545]  Now, for those that don't know, the military puts balloons up at 700 to 1,000 feet because you can put cameras over the horizon on them.
[00:14:01.206 --> 00:14:03.708]  And they're jacked in to all the power grid.
[00:14:04.574 --> 00:14:07.937]  Because when you opt into these windmill systems, you're in the national grid.
[00:14:08.257 --> 00:14:11.199]  You're the Texas grid that is the most powerful in the country.
[00:14:11.219 --> 00:14:16.023]  It's over 30% of the nation's power, supplying more than a dozen states part of their power.
[00:14:16.844 --> 00:14:23.669]  And I already knew this, but Bill did a superlative job with his guest explaining it.
[00:14:23.749 --> 00:14:30.395]  And I just, it really hit me this morning that our government is destroying the country for real.
[00:14:31.206 --> 00:14:32.366]  They're at war with us.
[00:14:32.826 --> 00:14:33.866]  It's totally criminal.
[00:14:34.126 --> 00:14:36.127]  I don't care how many good people are in the government.
[00:14:36.207 --> 00:14:36.647]  I know that.
[00:14:36.687 --> 00:14:38.087]  I'm not saying the government itself is the enemy.
[00:14:38.647 --> 00:14:43.268]  But the people running it are destroying their own interest as well.
[00:14:43.348 --> 00:14:44.948]  They don't give a damn.
[00:14:45.008 --> 00:14:48.369]  They are selling the nation out in live time.
[00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:50.329]  It is just incredible.
[00:14:51.809 --> 00:14:55.830]  So, I knew they put up 5G towers to jack into everything.
[00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:00.491]  For those who don't know, 5G can just basically force hack
[00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:15.115]  The systems they can send through it, any device, any appliance, any automobile, you name it, and everything's been set up for the NSA and the globalists to do that, but they're letting the Chai comms be part of it as well.
[00:15:15.135 --> 00:15:31.202]  I remember Reuters six years ago reported what we were already reporting, that Apple gave all their code keys to every Apple device, iPad, iPhone, ear pods, everywhere.
[00:15:32.458 --> 00:15:38.041]  And just the other day, I got home, my wife was out, and I was on the iPad, and I wasn't trying to spy on my wife.
[00:15:38.061 --> 00:15:45.126]  Her iPad, iPod, Apple Tracker system popped up, without me even asking for it.
[00:15:45.146 --> 00:15:54.471]  It just popped up, and I tried to close it, and I looked at it, and I'm like, oh, what's that?
[00:15:54.992 --> 00:15:57.853]  And I just zoomed in on it, and oh, she's in an AA meeting.
[00:15:58.114 --> 00:15:58.654]  Well, good for her.
[00:15:58.674 --> 00:16:01.075]  She said she had something to do, would be home late.
[00:16:01.095 --> 00:16:01.716]  There was an Annie there.
[00:16:02.975 --> 00:16:17.906]  Now imagine the power that Chai comms have in that all our devices that are Apple, and the droids are even worse by the way, they have that ability.
[00:16:18.967 --> 00:16:22.029]  And I thought, I never looked at this, let me look, where are these iPods?
[00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:23.090]  Okay, they're in the bedroom.
[00:16:23.451 --> 00:16:27.634]  We have like eight devices.
[00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:31.677]  Even iPads we haven't had for years, they were listed there.
[00:16:33.314 --> 00:16:38.780]  So that's just the tip of the iceberg, and by law, all new cars...
[00:16:45.214 --> 00:16:47.655]  And it's been being put in the new cars for at least 20 years.
[00:16:48.095 --> 00:16:56.577]  But under law, all new cars have these tracker chips in them to track you in live time with GPS and cell phone tower triangulation.
[00:16:57.317 --> 00:16:58.418]  You're like, well, what do I have to hide?
[00:16:58.438 --> 00:16:58.778]  No, no.
[00:17:00.038 --> 00:17:01.498]  It's like, why do you have locked doors at night?
[00:17:01.738 --> 00:17:02.639]  Not that you're a criminal.
[00:17:02.699 --> 00:17:03.699]  There's bad people.
[00:17:04.239 --> 00:17:06.960]  Why do you have a code key for your bank account?
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.621]  Why do you have a lock on your locker at the gym?
[00:17:10.801 --> 00:17:11.181]  Because
[00:17:12.622 --> 00:17:14.103]  That creates a layer of security.
[00:17:14.443 --> 00:17:21.506]  It's all gone, it's all completely fried, and the people running our country are completely sold out to China, and anybody else will give them money.
[00:17:23.147 --> 00:17:25.808]  And it's completely and absolutely insane.
[00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:33.271]  So, where am I going with this?
[00:17:33.331 --> 00:17:34.331]  Well, here's the next stack.
[00:17:35.312 --> 00:17:35.992]  Terrifying!
[00:17:36.092 --> 00:17:37.953]  And I went and looked at the bill when I saw this yesterday.
[00:17:39.093 --> 00:17:39.774]  Terrifying!
[00:17:39.874 --> 00:17:42.996]  FISA bill, and I remember they tried this a few years ago.
[00:17:43.177 --> 00:17:43.857]  It didn't pass.
[00:17:44.318 --> 00:17:46.940]  They're not just re-upping the FISA bill to warrantly spy on us.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.101]  Terrifying!
[00:17:48.181 --> 00:17:55.808]  FISA bill set to include vast new surveillance powers, forcing businesses to become NSA spies.
[00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:58.890]  That's Jamie wanted info wars.
[00:17:58.991 --> 00:18:03.515]  You can pull up Reuters and all the rest are reporting it, but it's to keep us safe.
[00:18:03.575 --> 00:18:04.776]  And of course,
[00:18:06.238 --> 00:18:10.920]  Ipatch McCain, our Texas Congressman, he loves it.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:20.063]  House Intelligence Committee, FISA reform bill would greatly expand the class of businesses and other entities required to assist in FISA 702.
[00:18:20.624 --> 00:18:31.328]  If you have any type of internet business, including a coffee shop, if you serve more than 20 people a month, you're supposed to then report and hook them in.
[00:18:32.308 --> 00:18:34.089]  Well, let me just say, we're not doing it.
[00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:38.536]  Because we're an internet service system, according to this.
[00:18:38.596 --> 00:18:45.082]  I'm not going to jack in and openly, because they're already jacked into everything, when it leaves your office.
[00:18:45.162 --> 00:18:48.545]  But now they want you to opt in, so you're agreeing to it all.
[00:18:48.565 --> 00:18:51.988]  Like when you hear the police, oh let us have access to all your surveillance cameras.
[00:18:52.348 --> 00:18:59.274]  Sounds great, but then when the criminals get busted, the Soros DAs just let them go anyways.
[00:18:59.294 --> 00:19:02.396]  Again, it's like they search you at the TSA and grab your testicles.
[00:19:03.382 --> 00:19:03.862]  Happened to me.
[00:19:04.322 --> 00:19:05.183]  I was out of town.
[00:19:05.363 --> 00:19:06.323]  Didn't go outside the U.S.
[00:19:06.343 --> 00:19:08.084]  Just went on a vacation, as you know, for 12 days.
[00:19:09.184 --> 00:19:11.365]  And both times, I'm on some list.
[00:19:13.346 --> 00:19:14.347]  They won't tell me what list.
[00:19:14.407 --> 00:19:16.167]  That's always part of real tyranny.
[00:19:16.747 --> 00:19:18.148]  And both times, I got pulled out.
[00:19:18.168 --> 00:19:19.509]  And would you like to go to a private screening room?
[00:19:19.529 --> 00:19:20.349]  Would you like to send such?
[00:19:20.389 --> 00:19:20.609]  No.
[00:19:21.649 --> 00:19:22.630]  Just hurry up and do it.
[00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.431]  By the way, I'm a big listener, Mr. Jones.
[00:19:24.471 --> 00:19:25.171]  Sorry we have to do this.
[00:19:25.611 --> 00:19:26.992]  I'm like, yeah, the border's wide open.
[00:19:27.312 --> 00:19:28.452]  There's massive human smuggling.
[00:19:28.472 --> 00:19:29.193]  He goes, I know.
[00:19:29.253 --> 00:19:29.853]  It's just a job.
[00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:33.312]  One of the guys talking was illicit, the other person didn't.
[00:19:33.612 --> 00:19:40.454]  And I got a dude, you know, rubbing my crotch and rubbing my ass and sticking his finger in my waistband.
[00:19:41.855 --> 00:19:44.656]  And that's just a humiliation ritual because I'm a dirty American.
[00:19:45.156 --> 00:19:46.116]  That's good training for me.
[00:19:46.636 --> 00:19:53.579]  But if the comment is Chinese, one of my hundreds of thousands of acres, thousands of square miles, wait till we play the report,
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:20:03.747]  All over the country, right next to military bases and right next to the border, and openly put up 700 foot spy towers with 5G and HD cameras.
[00:20:04.768 --> 00:20:05.368]  It's wonderful!
[00:20:07.309 --> 00:20:10.071]  The government is at war with the people.
[00:20:12.853 --> 00:20:21.500]  America was the thing in the way of global government because if people could aspire to due process and private property and freedom, they'd never buy into a global tyranny.
[00:20:23.319 --> 00:20:29.864]  But it just has really hit me, and I'm not giving up when I say this, it's the opposite, but it really hit me last night and this morning.
[00:20:30.405 --> 00:20:31.646]  We are already conquered.
[00:20:32.186 --> 00:20:35.269]  We are completely F you, you know what, Cade.
[00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:43.235]  And the crazy part is the establishment goes along with this and thinks they're winning.
[00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:51.062]  When you get rid of due process and get rid of private property, and just because you're in the club now doesn't mean you'll be in the club in six months or a year or a day.
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:21:02.902]  Smart elites can still be corrupt and boss hog and run things and have a bunch of money and skim, but they don't get rid of the due process and the basic freedom because it'll burn them.
[00:21:04.802 --> 00:21:11.664]  This establishment is so satanic and so immoral because the general public is lazy and immoral.
[00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:12.724]  Not everybody.
[00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:18.705]  But I'm 50, I've lived a lot, I've done a lot, I've been around, and let me tell you something.
[00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:32.575]  And I'm not saying this in general, I'm not saying everybody, but per capita, the young people are getting more and more corrupt, more and more deceptive, and I mean like 50 and below.
[00:21:33.535 --> 00:21:36.157]  The boomers are very selfish and naive.
[00:21:38.157 --> 00:21:41.099]  The young people, a large portion of them are criminals.
[00:21:42.179 --> 00:21:46.221]  And you've got honorable people and you've got dishonorable, and the honorable are more honorable than ever.
[00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:48.902]  We've got some of our best people are young people.
[00:21:49.707 --> 00:21:54.131]  But I have seen it for myself, outright criminal activity everywhere.
[00:21:56.092 --> 00:22:09.663]  And I've known the globalists are corrupt, but I've been naive about how much the average person, when given the ability, will
[00:22:11.135 --> 00:22:11.916]  We're good to go.
[00:22:27.503 --> 00:22:30.905]  Those are many times in my life I can't afford a personal pool, so I love the pool.
[00:22:30.985 --> 00:22:31.365]  I go to them.
[00:22:31.605 --> 00:22:35.367]  Try to find the smaller community pools or friends that have apartments that have got clean pools.
[00:22:36.747 --> 00:22:39.569]  I don't like to go to the community pool because you learn you're better than piss.
[00:22:40.329 --> 00:22:44.811]  But if one person takes a dump in the pool, they've got to shut it down because everybody sees it.
[00:22:45.131 --> 00:22:45.851]  You can't hide it.
[00:22:45.951 --> 00:22:46.332]  It's toxic.
[00:22:46.352 --> 00:22:47.012]  They've got to drain it.
[00:22:49.893 --> 00:22:53.395]  And so the old corrupt establishment was peeing in the pool.
[00:22:55.691 --> 00:23:06.358]  The establishment we've got now has hooked up a 12-inch pipe from the main sewer line and has filled the pool with pure cess, pure feces.
[00:23:07.138 --> 00:23:11.801]  You can't see any water, you can't see any blue light, you can't even see down an inch.
[00:23:11.941 --> 00:23:13.742]  It's solid feces.
[00:23:17.204 --> 00:23:21.507]  The federal government is solid feces at the top, which contaminates the whole thing.
[00:23:23.148 --> 00:23:24.669]  The public is dumbed down and decadent.
[00:23:27.967 --> 00:23:30.007]  We've killed 60 million plus babies.
[00:23:32.908 --> 00:23:34.248]  There is no due process.
[00:23:35.829 --> 00:23:37.229]  We've been hit with a bioweapon.
[00:23:37.769 --> 00:23:40.190]  Mainline British journals, government journals confirm.
[00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:41.050]  Okay.
[00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:43.770]  Yeah, it's 20 plus million dead worldwide.
[00:23:45.071 --> 00:23:45.611]  From the shots.
[00:23:45.651 --> 00:23:48.492]  That's top doctors in the UK that were pro-shot.
[00:23:49.792 --> 00:23:50.932]  Have come out and said, we were wrong.
[00:23:51.372 --> 00:23:52.812]  By the way, the government knows it's deliberate.
[00:23:52.832 --> 00:23:53.553]  They're killing everyone.
[00:23:54.673 --> 00:23:55.213]  That's in the news.
[00:23:58.971 --> 00:23:59.732]  Peer-reviewed study.
[00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:01.776]  Cancer deaths increase after COVID vaccination.
[00:24:02.096 --> 00:24:03.178]  British government-backed study.
[00:24:03.498 --> 00:24:05.061]  I mean, there's no doubt.
[00:24:06.884 --> 00:24:09.628]  And you try to tell the average person that's taking these shots?
[00:24:11.786 --> 00:24:20.848]  This has happened, and they are so selfish and lazy mentally, they'll decide you're a liar because they don't want to face the truth, and they'll double down and continue to take more.
[00:24:21.148 --> 00:24:23.388]  You can say, well, that's a Darwin Award, they deserve to die.
[00:24:23.668 --> 00:24:24.968]  Well, the children sure as hell don't.
[00:24:25.388 --> 00:24:31.029]  And I've got stacks of news here of college football players and others dropping dead of heart attacks, died suddenly.
[00:24:31.049 --> 00:24:35.130]  We don't just have the scientific evidence, we have the anecdotal all around us.
[00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:38.971]  You don't need to be a pathologist or an epidemiologist
[00:24:40.285 --> 00:24:40.985]  We're good to go.
[00:25:11.283 --> 00:25:18.609]  In your car driving on the highway and you see a car flip and blow up and bodies fly around and you later hear on the news that three people died in a car wreck.
[00:25:18.629 --> 00:25:22.152]  I mean, you don't need to be a pathologist to know it was the car wreck you saw that killed them.
[00:25:23.593 --> 00:25:27.416]  I mean, I've sat there multiple times and seen people die in front of me on the highway.
[00:25:27.976 --> 00:25:28.897]  Absolutely gruesome.
[00:25:31.459 --> 00:25:32.780]  And you know that person's dead.
[00:25:33.803 --> 00:25:34.844]  They're a homeless person.
[00:25:34.864 --> 00:25:36.385]  They just ran out in front of an 18-wheeler.
[00:25:36.765 --> 00:25:38.066]  It just ran over their ass.
[00:25:38.106 --> 00:25:40.167]  Their guts are all over the ground for a hundred feet.
[00:25:40.447 --> 00:25:42.088]  There's a big smear of their guts.
[00:25:43.049 --> 00:25:44.550]  Body parts all over the road.
[00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:46.371]  You know they're dead.
[00:25:48.752 --> 00:25:50.053]  But we have the pathologists.
[00:25:50.093 --> 00:25:51.274]  We have the peer-reviewed studies.
[00:25:51.314 --> 00:25:52.134]  We know what they've done.
[00:25:52.295 --> 00:25:52.575]  Again,
[00:25:53.939 --> 00:25:56.300]  That's why the enemy hits me and attacks me and laughs at me.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:02.204]  I was in a deposition yesterday, and the guy goes, oh, I noticed in bankruptcy you just liquidated your little farm.
[00:26:02.564 --> 00:26:03.884]  And he smiled and started laughing.
[00:26:03.924 --> 00:26:08.167]  I was like, man, I never even have time to go to that little farm I bought outside Austin years and years ago.
[00:26:08.487 --> 00:26:10.348]  It was a spot I might run to if things collapsed.
[00:26:10.668 --> 00:26:11.729]  I've said I'm going down with the ship.
[00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:17.792]  It meant nothing to me that he sat there and giggled and smiled like, ooh, you're going to get mad, aren't you?
[00:26:18.032 --> 00:26:19.353]  It means nothing to me.
[00:26:20.934 --> 00:26:30.796]  We're so far gone, the government, the Pentagon just hit us with a spike protein replicating spongiform encephalopathy style weapon?
[00:26:32.496 --> 00:26:35.197]  You almost killed a bunch of my family, you killed some of my friends!
[00:26:36.177 --> 00:26:38.377]  And I'm looking at these evil demons laughing at me.
[00:26:38.737 --> 00:26:42.478]  They don't know they're all being hit too, because they're so spiritually blind.
[00:26:44.158 --> 00:26:48.679]  I care about a national, federal government study I've got right here.
[00:26:53.032 --> 00:26:57.435]  Where they're giving two-year-olds puberty blockers because the two-year-old said, I'm another gender.
[00:26:58.816 --> 00:27:10.125]  You think any of us are safe when the federal government, and it's going on all over the world, is injecting two-year-olds because their phreakazoid parents want to create a mutant?
[00:27:13.767 --> 00:27:18.551]  If they can do medical stuff that would make Joseph Mingle a blush to two-year-old babies,
[00:27:20.993 --> 00:27:22.754]  They can do anything, people.
[00:27:23.274 --> 00:27:24.635]  It's all over.
[00:27:24.995 --> 00:27:26.296]  It's all gone.
[00:27:26.496 --> 00:27:27.796]  They're already killing us.
[00:27:28.477 --> 00:27:30.477]  The life expectancy is already dropping.
[00:27:33.219 --> 00:27:36.220]  The cancers and death are exploding.
[00:27:38.001 --> 00:27:39.182]  And I don't say that to scare you.
[00:27:39.242 --> 00:27:46.005]  I say it so you get hardcore how real this is.
[00:27:48.393 --> 00:27:49.875]  And the fact that it's horrible.
[00:27:50.476 --> 00:27:54.841]  But if you'll admit how bad it is, we have a chance to stop it and we're really turning the tide.
[00:27:54.861 --> 00:27:57.324]  So I mentioned some of the news.
[00:27:57.424 --> 00:27:58.205]  It gets worse.
[00:28:00.988 --> 00:28:02.310]  But that's some of what's coming up.
[00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.212]  What should I hit in detail when we come back?
[00:28:04.232 --> 00:28:05.674]  I've already given you a highlight.
[00:28:10.222 --> 00:28:10.962]  I'm going to move quick.
[00:28:11.042 --> 00:28:17.386]  Let's do China and the spy bases, the military bases, publicly run by generals, current CCP generals.
[00:28:17.406 --> 00:28:18.407]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[00:28:19.487 --> 00:28:29.012]  But don't worry, the FBI is going to go to hundreds of thousands of conservatives homes about what you said online, or, you know, we're going to have thousands of agents put thousands of people in jail for walking between velvet ropes.
[00:28:29.132 --> 00:28:30.433]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:28:32.234 --> 00:28:36.657]  Well, 90,000 kids are missing and sex slavery and other forms of slavery.
[00:28:36.717 --> 00:28:38.538]  The Senate report, I mean, under Biden,
[00:28:40.034 --> 00:28:41.255]  I'm going to hit the China.
[00:28:42.316 --> 00:28:46.020]  Then I'm going to hit the NSA taking over your computer and turning you into a spy.
[00:28:47.081 --> 00:28:48.623]  Then I'm going to hit the Trump situation.
[00:28:48.683 --> 00:28:49.343]  It's all coming up.
[00:28:49.383 --> 00:28:50.004]  InfoWars.com.
[00:28:59.352 --> 00:29:00.813]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is back.

[00:29:33.355 --> 00:29:34.376]  It will sell out quickly.

[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:49.645]  Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc, Selenium, L-Glutamine, the list goes on.
[00:29:49.665 --> 00:29:51.166]  I don't even have time to list everything in here.

[00:30:09.891 --> 00:30:19.638]  Picture this, a product that derives from ancient sea salts buried deep beneath the earth, harnessing a cutting-edge process that stabilizes iodine in a groundbreaking triiodine formula.
[00:30:20.098 --> 00:30:21.961]  Imagine waking up feeling rejuvenated.

[00:30:59.572 --> 00:31:01.913]  There is nothing more frustrating to me
[00:31:03.447 --> 00:31:12.138]  Whether it comes to news or anything else we're doing, then to know I'm telling the truth, and to know that you'll just listen to me and take action, it will change your life.
[00:31:13.007 --> 00:31:16.388]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have two great products that have been sold out for a long time.
[00:31:16.748 --> 00:31:19.509]  They're now back in stock at InfowarStore.com.
[00:31:20.109 --> 00:31:23.550]  X3 is the highest quality iodine, the missing link.
[00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:25.930]  It is back in stock, 40% off.
[00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:31.632]  And so is TurboForce, 10-hour clean energy, naturally released.
[00:31:31.832 --> 00:31:32.592]  It is amazing.
[00:31:33.032 --> 00:31:35.253]  Both of these products fund the Infowar.
[00:31:35.833 --> 00:31:38.414]  So they could be placebo and it'd still be great because you're funding Infowar.
[00:31:38.734 --> 00:31:39.154]  They're not.
[00:31:39.794 --> 00:31:42.738]  If you'll just try TurboForce, you'll see the results in 30 minutes.
[00:31:43.038 --> 00:31:45.381]  Incredible energy for 10 hours without the letdown.
[00:31:45.741 --> 00:31:51.508]  But if you will just take X3 on average for about two weeks, you will see amazing results because it's the missing link.
[00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:58.296]  X3 and TurboForce, both discounted now for a limited time at Infolwerestore.com.
[00:31:59.497 --> 00:32:09.040]  Unless you've been living under a rock, you've heard how amazing turmeric is for inflammation for your joints, your bones, your blood, your organs, your mind, everything.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.222]  Well, we have Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% curcuminoid extract.
[00:32:14.642 --> 00:32:17.144]  No one that we know of has it even above 85%.
[00:32:17.345 --> 00:32:25.812]  This is the strongest formula on the market, and it's way lower priced than some of the top brands out there that are 75%, 80% cumin oil.
[00:32:26.293 --> 00:32:29.075]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing.
[00:32:29.335 --> 00:32:30.576]  You're missing out if you don't try it.
[00:32:30.877 --> 00:32:36.442]  It's discounted right now, 40% off at Infowars.com, and it funds the Info War, a total 360 win.
[00:32:36.702 --> 00:32:38.524]  You owe it to yourself to try Body's.
[00:32:38.824 --> 00:32:39.665]  I know you'll be amazed.
[00:32:39.945 --> 00:32:40.926]  Get yours right now.
[00:32:41.246 --> 00:32:45.790]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:13.767 --> 00:33:15.028]  Listen to this song.
[00:33:15.128 --> 00:33:16.269]  It's Earl Belladry.
[00:33:16.309 --> 00:33:16.929]  Earl Sparkly.
[00:33:16.989 --> 00:33:17.750]  Here's the key.
[00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:18.550]  I knew too much.
[00:33:41.835 --> 00:33:43.176]  Does that make me crazy?
[00:33:43.196 --> 00:33:44.556]  Does that make me crazy?
[00:33:44.776 --> 00:33:46.097]  Does that make me crazy?
[00:33:46.117 --> 00:33:48.298]  Does that make me crazy?
[00:33:48.338 --> 00:33:49.198]  Possibly.
[00:33:49.258 --> 00:33:54.060]  And here's the important part.
[00:34:12.492 --> 00:34:13.693]  Bless your soul!
[00:34:13.753 --> 00:34:14.994]  You think you're in control?
[00:34:33.264 --> 00:34:34.625]  Because that made me crazy.
[00:34:34.645 --> 00:34:51.631]  In the end, he says, you know, I always wanted to be like those people that were out on the edge, that were doing what was right, who were the Mavericks.
[00:34:52.231 --> 00:34:54.992]  And I can tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen, we are the Mavericks.
[00:34:56.973 --> 00:34:59.454]  And I remember thinking,
[00:35:05.077 --> 00:35:06.218]  I wanna be like them.
[00:35:06.418 --> 00:35:07.079]  We've done it.
[00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:08.039]  And God's watching.
[00:35:08.259 --> 00:35:08.900]  Absolutely.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.001]  Mission complete.
[00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:14.424]  Ladies and gentlemen, things are gonna get really rough, and I was thinking about
[00:35:35.038 --> 00:35:37.279]  Writing a book, maybe Alex Jones's Rules.
[00:35:40.579 --> 00:35:44.780]  Don't take it lying down, some kind of headline like that, just of the experiences, the lessons I've learned.
[00:35:46.621 --> 00:35:48.221]  And I was thinking, what would some of the rules be?
[00:35:49.641 --> 00:35:53.442]  Well, first off, keep your eyes and ears open.
[00:35:54.183 --> 00:35:55.303]  Don't close your eyes.
[00:35:55.363 --> 00:35:56.763]  Don't deny what you're seeing.
[00:35:57.743 --> 00:35:58.724]  Go with your research.
[00:35:58.764 --> 00:35:59.524]  Go with your instincts.
[00:35:59.564 --> 00:36:00.464]  Go with the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:01.324 --> 00:36:04.345]  But also, don't take it lying down.
[00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:08.332]  It's one thing to know what's going on, but do nothing about it.
[00:36:08.392 --> 00:36:09.633]  No, don't take it lying down.
[00:36:12.215 --> 00:36:13.796]  And then Rob was talking to me during the break.
[00:36:14.056 --> 00:36:15.237]  Rob Iguoros, he said, yeah.
[00:36:18.359 --> 00:36:19.400]  Everything comes to an end.
[00:36:19.901 --> 00:36:20.881]  Death's the great equalizer.
[00:36:20.901 --> 00:36:21.402]  And that's right.
[00:36:22.402 --> 00:36:23.123]  God's real.
[00:36:23.803 --> 00:36:24.964]  The globalists aren't God.
[00:36:25.584 --> 00:36:26.605]  And they will come to an end.
[00:36:27.906 --> 00:36:28.787]  Everything comes to an end.
[00:36:32.609 --> 00:36:33.170]  Except God.
[00:36:35.169 --> 00:36:38.191]  And I really feel sorry for the globalists.
[00:36:39.612 --> 00:36:40.832]  I've always hated them.
[00:36:41.753 --> 00:36:45.735]  But I did what I did, not because I hated them, because I love the people I was fighting for.
[00:36:45.775 --> 00:36:50.538]  But as I've gotten older, it was always about 90% love, 10% hate.
[00:36:52.999 --> 00:36:56.461]  But now, it's liberating.
[00:36:56.581 --> 00:36:58.042]  I don't have any hate for these people.
[00:36:59.983 --> 00:37:01.324]  I actually really feel sorry for them.
[00:37:02.585 --> 00:37:03.525]  Because they missed the boat.
[00:37:03.625 --> 00:37:05.226]  They missed the opportunity to be good people.
[00:37:06.206 --> 00:37:08.187]  And in their lives, they didn't become better people.
[00:37:08.227 --> 00:37:09.167]  They became worse people.
[00:37:11.208 --> 00:37:12.829]  I was never a conscious Satanist.
[00:37:12.889 --> 00:37:14.529]  I never got on my knees and prayed to the devil.
[00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:26.593]  But I was enthralled by evil and the pride of Lucifer and almost went to the dark side when I was about 16, 17.
[00:37:28.766 --> 00:37:34.350]  But God reached down and grabbed me by the scruff of my neck and slammed me up against the wall and said, you're not going to do that.
[00:37:35.551 --> 00:37:38.352]  And put the choice clearly, squarely before me and I chose God.
[00:37:38.372 --> 00:37:42.375]  And then God said, we're going to dig out of what you've done.
[00:37:42.395 --> 00:37:45.577]  Because faith without works is dead.
[00:37:48.019 --> 00:37:50.080]  And I'm going to use you as an instrument against evil.
[00:37:53.363 --> 00:37:53.883]  And we've done it.
[00:37:54.984 --> 00:37:56.725]  And now our most important work is to come.
[00:37:58.354 --> 00:37:59.415]  They could put me in prison.
[00:38:00.716 --> 00:38:01.878]  They could kill me tomorrow.
[00:38:02.138 --> 00:38:04.680]  And the work we've done here will echo into the future.
[00:38:05.321 --> 00:38:10.966]  And the work you've done supporting us and all the work you've done separately has been devastating to the enemy.
[00:38:12.148 --> 00:38:14.650]  And I want you all to recognize how far we've come together.
[00:38:16.832 --> 00:38:19.615]  But I also want you to recognize how much trouble we're in.
[00:38:21.503 --> 00:38:28.309]  And when you try to apply logic to what our enemies are doing, you have to understand it's a satanic knowledge.
[00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:31.031]  It's a satanic system.
[00:38:32.252 --> 00:38:36.155]  And it creates a system, but it's a system of deception for its own people.
[00:38:36.595 --> 00:38:42.760]  And the end game is nothing but betrayal, and pain, and loneliness, and separation from God.
[00:38:44.482 --> 00:38:47.904]  And that's not a place anyone consciously would want to be.
[00:38:49.466 --> 00:38:50.787]  That once you're caught in evil,
[00:38:53.237 --> 00:39:01.903]  And once you decide to cheat and go with the world because you think it'll give you some power and people will think you're cool, well, you've lost your soul.
[00:39:03.525 --> 00:39:05.546]  You can see those people that have lost their souls.
[00:39:06.147 --> 00:39:07.087]  The walking dead.
[00:39:08.869 --> 00:39:09.529]  The zombies.
[00:39:11.991 --> 00:39:13.632]  And I repent for laughing at them.
[00:39:14.673 --> 00:39:18.656]  If you go back 10 years ago, I started cutting back on making fun of the left.
[00:39:21.147 --> 00:39:23.968]  And then in the last five years, we've gone almost zero.
[00:39:24.968 --> 00:39:44.013]  I caught myself doing it last week, and Owen does a great job, when Owen was making fun of Sheila Jackson Lee, saying that the moon almost touched the sun during the eclipse, and almost set it on fire, and that the moon is like Saturn, a gas giant.
[00:39:45.173 --> 00:39:47.994]  I mean, the woman literally has a 70 IQ.
[00:39:49.892 --> 00:39:54.977]  Well, that's a joke on us that a mentally retarded person is a powerful U.S.
[00:39:55.017 --> 00:39:55.617]  Congresswoman.
[00:39:56.518 --> 00:39:57.259]  It's not funny.
[00:39:58.079 --> 00:40:04.926]  Like if you got on a jumbo jet and you looked into the cockpit and a person with a lobotomy was flying in.
[00:40:05.166 --> 00:40:10.551]  You wouldn't laugh and go, haha, look, they got a person with a lobotomy flying the airplane.
[00:40:11.986 --> 00:40:20.328]  Or if you saw a serious Down Syndrome individual, beautiful people, love them, not putting them down, but would you laugh at a Down Syndrome person as the pilot?
[00:40:20.728 --> 00:40:23.269]  Or would you say, oh my God, we're all in danger?
[00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:27.250]  It's not funny.
[00:40:30.771 --> 00:40:33.252]  You notice I don't make jokes about these people anymore.
[00:40:34.052 --> 00:40:35.012]  Because it ain't funny!
[00:40:40.334 --> 00:40:41.074]  And I realize
[00:40:44.002 --> 00:40:47.423]  That hell on earth is already being released and things are going to get really bad.
[00:40:49.064 --> 00:40:55.147]  And I'm somebody that's got guts and I can hack a lot.
[00:40:57.168 --> 00:41:04.831]  And I look around at the general public who's incredibly soft and incredibly naive and they have no idea what's coming down on them.
[00:41:06.252 --> 00:41:06.632]  No idea.
[00:41:09.983 --> 00:41:15.087]  And so as Christ hung on the cross, he said, Forgive them, Father, because they know not what they do.
[00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:27.858]  And Christ, the focused personification of God, in the Garden of Gethsemane, before he was taken by the Romans, said, Father, let this cup pass from me.
[00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:31.481]  And God told his son, It does not pass from you.
[00:41:32.542 --> 00:41:38.107]  And Jesus wept, because all the sins of the world, by a pure entity,
[00:41:39.656 --> 00:41:54.809]  Christ was going to have to experience murder and death and starvation and loneliness and children being tortured and human sacrifice and all the sins that humans had committed were going to commit and were committing at that moment.
[00:41:55.349 --> 00:42:05.118]  God had to take it on for us to transmute the sin so that something unholy could be grafted onto something pure.
[00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:15.653]  The Bible says at least three times, with the beginning of knowledge comes sorrow, and with great knowledge comes great sorrow.
[00:42:20.135 --> 00:42:22.295]  People that have satanic energy feel invincible.
[00:42:23.556 --> 00:42:24.376]  It's a fire!
[00:42:26.757 --> 00:42:29.398]  It's mindless and it's stupid.
[00:42:30.939 --> 00:42:32.820]  But the pain of great knowledge
[00:42:35.908 --> 00:42:45.576]  is offset by the incredible completion, it's not ecstasy, it's total peace of being connected to God.
[00:42:45.596 --> 00:42:46.497]  Let's skip this next break.
[00:42:48.559 --> 00:42:49.419]  Sorry I told you guys.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.361]  I didn't tell you guys to skip it.
[00:42:53.383 --> 00:42:58.106]  So, we have to mourn for those that have fallen to Satan.
[00:43:03.231 --> 00:43:04.432]  And we have to forgive them.
[00:43:05.316 --> 00:43:20.868]  Because they don't know what they've done, but that does not mean we don't stop them, and we don't oppose them, and when the time is right, in the different ways that God directs us, destroy them.
[00:43:25.472 --> 00:43:31.997]  And I take no pleasure in our enemies' destruction, and many of us will be destroyed along with them in the process.
[00:43:33.263 --> 00:43:38.008]  And all of us will pay in this life and in the next level for what we've done.
[00:43:38.048 --> 00:43:39.769]  Make no mistake, God is righteous.
[00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:41.291]  God is pure.
[00:43:41.311 --> 00:43:45.435]  And if you don't know that vengeance is mine, say it to the Lord.
[00:43:45.495 --> 00:43:55.745]  And if you don't know that if you are upset about what evil is doing, God is infinitely more upset because we are only in the waiting room of eternity right now.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:15.302]  All right, it's so insane that we've done about this.
[00:44:17.022 --> 00:44:24.624]  I remember during the Clinton administration when there were Chinese generals at the White House with giant bags of cash.
[00:44:25.264 --> 00:44:26.064]  It was on C-SPAN.
[00:44:26.204 --> 00:44:28.205]  They were on C-SPAN taking suitcases of cash.
[00:44:31.092 --> 00:44:34.314]  It was Clinton just flaunting, like, why do you flaunt it?
[00:44:34.334 --> 00:44:35.114]  It's to break your will.
[00:44:35.174 --> 00:44:37.596]  Like, hey, we're going to cut your kid's penis off when they're five years old.
[00:44:37.656 --> 00:44:39.497]  That's an old exercise of power.
[00:44:40.617 --> 00:44:54.605]  And I remember going to events and things and having colonels and lieutenant colonels and former major generals and people, you know, at dinner going, they've set up CHICOM bases and Clinton's letting them set up bases.
[00:44:54.686 --> 00:44:57.007]  And I remember going, these guys are paranoid.
[00:44:58.109 --> 00:45:01.110]  And there's CHICOM bases in Mexico, and I'm like, yeah, right.
[00:45:02.831 --> 00:45:05.913]  And then the last decade, we learned they bought up all this farmland.
[00:45:06.573 --> 00:45:12.156]  The Chinese Communist Party is the biggest landowner after Bill Gates in the U.S., but he's the biggest private, but they're bigger than him.
[00:45:12.776 --> 00:45:20.019]  And then you learn they're setting up all these antenna arrays and spy grids and 700-foot towers and jacking into the national security grid.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:25.522]  I mean, if you drive around the edge of a military base, even one that's not that important,
[00:45:28.194 --> 00:45:31.715]  People are going to pull up and grab you and point guns at you and take you in and interrogate you.
[00:45:32.496 --> 00:45:33.096]  It's happened to me.
[00:45:34.557 --> 00:45:41.119]  I'm there covering, you know, information we've got about troops being killed during a test and, you know, things like that.
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:42.700]  Fort Sam Houston.
[00:45:46.801 --> 00:45:52.604]  But when you're the Communist Chinese and you build a base right next door with cameras pointed at the military base, it's fine with the FBI.
[00:45:54.405 --> 00:45:57.626]  Because the Justice Department tells the FBI who they can investigate.
[00:45:58.387 --> 00:46:01.009]  It's like the FBI can't investigate the 90,000 missing children.
[00:46:01.049 --> 00:46:01.630]  That's on record.
[00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:03.451]  I've had federal judges tell me to my face.
[00:46:04.111 --> 00:46:04.712]  Say, what do we do?
[00:46:04.732 --> 00:46:06.133]  I'm like, you're a federal judge.
[00:46:06.613 --> 00:46:08.015]  You're as smart as I am, at least.
[00:46:08.335 --> 00:46:09.716]  I don't... What do we do?
[00:46:09.736 --> 00:46:10.717]  Well, we draw attention to it.
[00:46:11.037 --> 00:46:13.399]  But we just keep drawing attention to this.
[00:46:15.741 --> 00:46:19.964]  So you should go to InfoWars.com and watch the full... I don't think they put the whole thing up.
[00:46:19.984 --> 00:46:20.664]  There's a lot of it.
[00:46:20.784 --> 00:46:21.225]  It's up there.
[00:46:22.105 --> 00:46:22.926]  I couldn't find the whole thing.
[00:46:22.946 --> 00:46:24.207]  I don't really watch mainstream TV.
[00:46:24.227 --> 00:46:26.069]  We're going to find it and air the whole thing in the next few days.
[00:46:26.629 --> 00:46:27.530]  But I watched a lot of it.
[00:46:28.613 --> 00:46:31.053]  Experts sound alarm over China's buying U.S.
[00:46:31.093 --> 00:46:32.394]  land near military bases.
[00:46:32.454 --> 00:46:32.814]  Chilling.
[00:46:33.394 --> 00:46:34.074]  Fox Business.
[00:46:35.094 --> 00:46:35.754]  NBC News.
[00:46:35.794 --> 00:46:36.855]  Foreign purchase of land near U.S.
[00:46:36.915 --> 00:46:39.255]  military bases would require government approval under new rules.
[00:46:40.775 --> 00:46:41.955]  Here's a big report in Forbes.
[00:46:42.015 --> 00:46:46.016]  Why a secretive Chinese billionaire bought 140,000 acres of land in Texas.
[00:46:46.036 --> 00:46:46.956]  He's a Chinese general.
[00:46:48.497 --> 00:46:48.777]  So.
[00:46:50.497 --> 00:46:52.117]  And he built it where there's not high winds.
[00:46:52.177 --> 00:46:53.057]  Where it doesn't even work.
[00:46:55.318 --> 00:46:55.498]  So.
[00:46:56.957 --> 00:46:58.078]  And this is all built now.
[00:46:59.058 --> 00:46:59.719]  I've been down there.
[00:47:01.099 --> 00:47:05.642]  So here's just a short clip from Dr. Phil talking about this.
[00:47:05.662 --> 00:47:06.022]  Here it is.
[00:47:06.803 --> 00:47:09.144]  They're strategically buying land around that.
[00:47:09.184 --> 00:47:10.445]  This is not random.
[00:47:11.966 --> 00:47:13.186]  They're in the same county.
[00:47:13.307 --> 00:47:14.647]  They're right up against this.
[00:47:14.827 --> 00:47:16.008]  How is this happening, Kyle?
[00:47:16.148 --> 00:47:17.108]  You're the expert here.
[00:47:17.168 --> 00:47:20.209]  There's one down in Texas, right there on the border near Del Rio.
[00:47:20.629 --> 00:47:20.889]  Right.
[00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:23.931]  Where it's actually a Chinese general.
[00:47:24.331 --> 00:47:32.634]  General Sun came in and bought over 100 square miles of land between our most active Air Force training base and our border.
[00:47:33.886 --> 00:47:36.807]  And he filed permits to put up windmills.
[00:47:37.328 --> 00:47:40.329]  It's an area on a scale of 1 to 10 that might have a wind factor of 3.5.
[00:47:41.249 --> 00:47:45.371]  If you and I were putting up a windmill, we'd put it up where it's an 8 or a 10, where there's some wind.
[00:47:45.531 --> 00:47:45.811]  Right.
[00:47:46.072 --> 00:47:47.832]  They want to put up windmills for two reasons.
[00:47:47.912 --> 00:47:49.493]  They want to connect directly to the U.S.
[00:47:49.553 --> 00:47:54.475]  grid, so that they can upload malware to the grid, and they can monitor the grid.
[00:47:55.156 --> 00:47:58.457]  And they also want to build these windmills 700 feet tall.
[00:47:58.517 --> 00:48:02.419]  Imagine a windmill that's almost as tall as the Washington Monument.
[00:48:03.112 --> 00:48:12.785]  And they can put cameras up there that map the horizon, and they can map the horizon with one square inch of clarity, right next to our largest Air Force military training base.
[00:48:13.026 --> 00:48:15.569]  Every Air Force pilot trains at Laughlin Air Force Base.
[00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:20.235]  They can map every person, every plane, every hypersonic that glides by.
[00:48:20.876 --> 00:48:26.220]  What it has to do is go through a process called CFIUS, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which the U.S.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.601]  Treasury is in charge of.
[00:48:27.942 --> 00:48:29.283]  And DOD's a piece of it.
[00:48:29.663 --> 00:48:34.066]  There are all these different departments that are part of CFIUS, but the U.S.
[00:48:34.106 --> 00:48:34.787]  Treasury runs it.
[00:48:35.127 --> 00:48:35.768]  Here's the problem.
[00:48:36.508 --> 00:48:36.648]  U.S.
[00:48:36.688 --> 00:48:38.730]  Treasury is owned by Wall Street.
[00:48:39.591 --> 00:48:48.119]  And Wall Street can't wait to invest another dollar in the land of 1.3 billion people of puppy dogs and rainbows and make some more money in China.
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:53.024]  So whenever anything really comes down to it, if Treasury's in charge, we're in real trouble.
[00:48:53.705 --> 00:48:58.389]  And so all of these deals that you're showing here, many of them have just walked through CFIUS.
[00:48:59.711 --> 00:49:00.952]  So that's the problem.
[00:49:05.091 --> 00:49:07.012]  Alright, and there's a lot more, it gets a lot worse.
[00:49:07.052 --> 00:49:08.612]  And by the way, it's worse than they were saying there.
[00:49:08.632 --> 00:49:09.893]  They were being very conservative.
[00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:12.014]  So, let's expand on that now.
[00:49:12.894 --> 00:49:15.195]  You have the NSA wired into the Five Eyes.
[00:49:15.275 --> 00:49:16.956]  You have Communist China wired into that.
[00:49:18.356 --> 00:49:19.717]  They're wired into the power grid.
[00:49:20.237 --> 00:49:22.398]  I mean, that's infrastructure protection.
[00:49:22.578 --> 00:49:33.762]  If the local police in the country, and they should be trained to this, if they catch you at a key infrastructure facility breaking in and you're up in the equipment, they're authorized to shoot you in the back.
[00:49:35.592 --> 00:49:42.537]  Well, the Chi-Coms don't need to go climb into one to shut off, say, all the power in Texas that would cut off power across the country in many areas.
[00:49:42.557 --> 00:49:45.839]  It's a chain reaction.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.461]  They're just jacked into it.
[00:49:48.401 --> 00:49:54.446]  Now, I guarantee you, if I had billions of dollars and I tried to go get a permit and do that, they wouldn't let me in because of my political background, because I'm a loyal American.
[00:49:56.747 --> 00:49:58.649]  That's what the whole de-platforming is about, the de-banking.
[00:49:59.522 --> 00:50:00.442]  I can barely get a bank account.
[00:50:00.942 --> 00:50:07.124]  But if you're a communist Chinese general, you can waltz in next to a military base and buy the land all around and aim cameras in on it.
[00:50:08.264 --> 00:50:08.545]  They can.
[00:50:09.685 --> 00:50:19.768]  These cameras are so good, these HD cameras, when the atmospherics are right, they can literally look at the antenna on a ant's head.
[00:50:21.768 --> 00:50:27.690]  And imagine those cameras are zooming in just miles away on those secretive military equipment.
[00:50:29.309 --> 00:50:30.710]  You know what's being loaded on the planes?
[00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:31.770]  Everything.
[00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:36.112]  They got acoustics, they're listening, and our government just lets them do it.
[00:50:38.053 --> 00:50:42.055]  If I wanted to show you, you've seen them, there's thousands of videos, I see like 50 a day without even trying to look.
[00:50:42.235 --> 00:50:42.835]  I don't watch them.
[00:50:43.796 --> 00:50:51.379]  Of the FBI going to people's houses, I watch some of them, a few of them, they're like, well you, you've made a post on this, you didn't threaten anybody, but we'd like to come in and talk to you about your post.
[00:50:51.639 --> 00:50:53.580]  You don't like Obama very much, or Biden.
[00:50:54.778 --> 00:51:01.242]  They've got them running around everywhere while they're human trafficking, sex slavery, fentanyl, chi-com bases.
[00:51:01.422 --> 00:51:02.742]  It's a joke, people.
[00:51:03.783 --> 00:51:05.404]  And Trump is in a criminal trial.
[00:51:07.485 --> 00:51:08.906]  So he can't go around the country.
[00:51:08.946 --> 00:51:11.487]  The judge is ordering him to stay there or he'll jail him.
[00:51:11.527 --> 00:51:12.988]  I think Trump should call his bluff.
[00:51:14.209 --> 00:51:15.589]  Time for a constitutional crisis.
[00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:17.030]  Time for the Supreme Court to rule.
[00:51:17.871 --> 00:51:18.911]  Oh, and what's he on trial for?
[00:51:19.231 --> 00:51:19.932]  Election meddling.
[00:51:20.712 --> 00:51:20.832]  From 2016.
[00:51:23.834 --> 00:51:26.435]  Well, they openly take him off the ballot and election medal.
[00:51:26.916 --> 00:51:28.016]  But here's the next big piece.
[00:51:28.597 --> 00:51:29.237]  Terrifying!
[00:51:29.317 --> 00:51:35.220]  FISA bill set to include vast new surveillance powers, forcing businesses to become NSA spies.
[00:51:36.801 --> 00:51:40.083]  Bill, it's passed the House, now they're adding crap in the Senate.
[00:51:41.983 --> 00:51:46.526]  Another big article from Zero Hedge, NSA just days away from taking over the Internet, warns Ed Snowden.
[00:51:47.987 --> 00:51:51.088]  Let's go ahead and play Gregory's latest report on this.
[00:51:51.148 --> 00:51:51.929]  It's very important.
[00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:56.491]  It's being posted on The Real Alex Jones, or if it isn't already there, I want to make sure it's there.
[00:51:56.911 --> 00:51:58.852]  This is a very important report.
[00:51:59.332 --> 00:52:04.215]  Let me give you the title of the report so you can find it at Man.Video and Real Alex Jones and share the hell out of it.
[00:52:06.175 --> 00:52:06.856]  Small U.S.
[00:52:06.896 --> 00:52:09.157]  businesses to be forced to serve as NSA spies.
[00:52:10.302 --> 00:52:13.265]  That doesn't even deal with the spying issue, just the fact you're being indentured.
[00:52:13.545 --> 00:52:15.106]  That's the same thing as quartering troops.
[00:52:15.547 --> 00:52:21.813]  To the bill of rights that they can't quarter troops in your house, make you pay for the board and food of military.
[00:52:22.353 --> 00:52:32.703]  But now as a business, you gotta pay to hook their systems in and sign off on them spying on everything you do, and your employees do, and your customers do.
[00:52:33.403 --> 00:52:33.744]  Here it is.
[00:52:41.644 --> 00:52:53.313]  An absolutely indispensable tool that Congress can give us in our fight against foreign adversaries is the reauthorization of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
[00:52:54.174 --> 00:53:02.260]  It is critical in securing our nation and we are in crunch time with our 702 authority set to expire next week.
[00:53:03.481 --> 00:53:06.864]  So let me be clear, failure to reauthorize 702
[00:53:09.366 --> 00:53:16.692]  Or gutting it with some new kind of warrant requirement would be dangerous and put Americans' lives at risk.
[00:53:17.212 --> 00:53:25.879]  Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was enacted to make it easier for the government to address foreign terrorist threats.
[00:53:26.439 --> 00:53:35.906]  Targeting Americans is prohibited, but intelligence agencies have used Section 702 to spy on hundreds of thousands of Americans every year.
[00:53:36.407 --> 00:53:38.749]  And this week, it's looking to get a lot worse.
[00:53:39.429 --> 00:53:47.955]  Elizabeth Goytien of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice does a great job of explaining it and sounding the alarm.
[00:53:48.795 --> 00:53:58.442]  Buried in the Section 702 reauthorization bill passed by the House on Friday is the biggest expansion of domestic surveillance since the Patriot Act.
[00:53:59.182 --> 00:54:11.806]  Under current law, the government can compel electronic communications service providers that have direct access to communications to assist the NSA in conducting Section 702 surveillance.
[00:54:12.246 --> 00:54:23.009]  Companies like Verizon and Google must turn over the communications of targets, which officially must be foreigners overseas, but this has been abused to spy on Americans.
[00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:28.011]  By changing the definition of electronic communications surveillance provider,
[00:54:28.431 --> 00:54:38.433]  An amendment offered by House Intel Committee leaders and passed by the House vastly expands the universe of entities that can be compelled to assist the NSA.
[00:54:39.113 --> 00:54:52.936]  If the bill becomes law, any company or individual that provides any service whatsoever may be forced to assist in NSA surveillance, as long as they have access to equipment on which communications are transmitted or stored.
[00:54:54.216 --> 00:55:04.343]  When the amendment was first unveiled, civil liberties advocates noted that the provision would encompass hotels, libraries, and coffee shops, and so they were excluded.
[00:55:04.823 --> 00:55:06.424]  But the vast majority of U.S.
[00:55:06.464 --> 00:55:18.953]  businesses remain fair game, including barber shops, laundromats, fitness centers, hardware stores, and any small business that provides Wi-Fi to their customers via routers.
[00:55:19.773 --> 00:55:32.378]  It also includes commercial landlords that rent out offices, which would target journalists, lawyers, financial advisors, healthcare providers, and anyone renting commercial office space.
[00:55:32.918 --> 00:55:48.445]  The amendment even includes service providers who come into our homes, such as house cleaners, plumbers, and IT service providers, all of whom could be forced to serve as surrogate spies and be required to give the NSA direct access.
[00:55:49.265 --> 00:55:51.667]  And none of them would be allowed to tell anyone.
[00:55:52.108 --> 00:55:56.651]  They would be under a gag order and would face heavy penalties if they failed to comply.
[00:55:57.332 --> 00:56:07.781]  Having wholesale access to domestic communications, the NSA would then be on the honor system to retain only the communications of approved foreign targets.
[00:56:08.221 --> 00:56:12.024]  And we know from past experience that they cannot be trusted to do this.
[00:56:12.865 --> 00:56:15.346]  The Senate is scheduled to vote on the bill this week.
[00:56:15.866 --> 00:56:28.131]  Section 702 expires on April 19th, but the Biden administration has obtained FISA court approval to continue Section 702 surveillance until April of 2025.
[00:56:28.971 --> 00:56:34.314]  Call your senators now and tell them to block the everyone is a spy surveillance bill.
[00:56:35.234 --> 00:56:37.735]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:56:39.378 --> 00:56:42.099]  So, they are pressing us into service.
[00:56:42.179 --> 00:56:45.299]  They're already doing it, but they want everybody to tacitly agree to it.
[00:56:45.399 --> 00:56:46.620]  All the cars are tracked now.
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:47.800]  All the new cars.
[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:50.361]  California's introduced bills to ban all the old cars.
[00:56:50.961 --> 00:56:52.021]  This is a criminal takeover.
[00:56:52.041 --> 00:56:54.502]  We're going to start the next hour with Julian Assange's brother.
[00:56:54.862 --> 00:56:56.622]  This is going to be historic, very important.
[00:56:57.102 --> 00:56:57.782]  Please stay with us.
[00:56:58.242 --> 00:56:59.543]  Please remember we're a listener supported.

[00:57:04.904 --> 00:57:07.104]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion sold out for a long time.

[00:57:29.989 --> 00:57:33.551]  So what I really want to ask you to do is pray for myself and the crew and my family.
[00:57:33.591 --> 00:57:34.051]  That's number one.
[00:57:34.071 --> 00:57:34.611]  I want that.
[00:57:34.631 --> 00:57:35.132]  I need that.
[00:57:35.372 --> 00:57:37.373]  It's your prayer that's doing it.
[00:57:37.433 --> 00:57:38.734]  That's why this surfaced.
[00:57:39.074 --> 00:57:39.954]  That's why this happened.
[00:57:59.528 --> 00:58:08.628]  I need the prayer, that I need you to take the articles, the videos, the posts we make at Real Alex Jones, recopy them, share them, post them yourself, do whatever, just get it out there.
[00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:10.091]  And I need you

[00:58:31.635 --> 00:58:32.275]  That's amazing.
[00:58:33.375 --> 00:58:36.316]  Discover the power of Tri-Ionide, Deep Earth Crystal Ionide X3, 40% off.
[00:58:39.497 --> 00:58:53.081]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[00:58:53.461 --> 00:59:00.483]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of, is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[00:59:00.643 --> 00:59:02.663]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[00:59:02.843 --> 00:59:03.924]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[00:59:03.964 --> 00:59:04.624]  He loved the idea.
[00:59:04.964 --> 00:59:08.467]  What would you call the debates and discussions about a pro-human future?
[00:59:08.507 --> 00:59:09.387]  Just Team Humanity?
[00:59:09.447 --> 00:59:10.348]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[00:59:10.488 --> 00:59:10.928]  Absolutely.
[00:59:11.249 --> 00:59:12.629]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:16.152]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family, standing against the globalists.
[00:59:16.372 --> 00:59:20.075]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser.
[00:59:20.095 --> 00:59:23.837]  You have InfoWars on the air, so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[00:59:24.097 --> 00:59:29.121]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a
[00:59:29.321 --> 00:59:32.122]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:00:08.132 --> 01:00:09.432]  There's a crisis to Iran in this moment.
[01:00:10.333 --> 01:00:10.573]  Don't.
[01:00:13.433 --> 01:00:26.256]  The globalists, like Bertrand Russell and others, proposed, this is public, using neutron bombs to depopulate the Earth because they don't destroy the cities, they don't destroy the farmland, there's no residual radiation to speak of.
[01:00:26.576 --> 01:00:35.878]  These troops, forming a special task force, were the first in our army's history to engage in a tactical exercise supported by live nuclear firepower.
[01:00:36.994 --> 01:00:46.141]  The reactor is programmed, and the subject positioned, to receive a mid-head dose of approximately 10,000 rads of mixed gamma and neutron radiation.
[01:00:46.901 --> 01:00:52.365]  And, within a matter, uh, let's just consider we're less than an hour, you'll be dead.
[01:00:52.746 --> 01:00:56.949]  Just extrapolating that out, if Iran hits Israel hard enough, and if the U.S.
[01:00:56.989 --> 01:01:00.512]  hits Iran back when they counter-strike, and Russia gets involved,
[01:01:01.252 --> 01:01:07.059]  Don't be surprised if all the major cities of Iran and their military bases get hit with neutron bombs.
[01:01:07.239 --> 01:01:11.583]  No secret that we have the technical capabilities required to manufacture a nuclear bomb.
[01:01:11.804 --> 01:01:14.587]  A red line should be drawn right here.
[01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:20.013]  Before Iran gets to a point where it's a few months away or a few weeks away.
[01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:25.271]  From amassing enough enriched uranium to make a nuclear weapon.
[01:01:25.451 --> 01:01:43.755]  I think the real agenda that we're going to see unfold is Israel going into a narcissistic hysteria and a delusional pride that only Israel and Israelis can generate that is going to lead them down this reckless path of escalation.
[01:01:44.415 --> 01:02:00.130]  And I do see the Israelis launching attacks in the United States, Operation Gladio, false flags to try and blame Iran, thinking that we can be fooled, goaded, lured, or tricked into a war against Iran, a military response.
[01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:03.473]  What role in the Middle East, again, does Israel play in this?
[01:02:04.783 --> 01:02:10.507]  Israel was created as the instrument to bring about the Battle of Armageddon and the fulfillment of prophecy.
[01:02:10.867 --> 01:02:19.413]  A war that would be so terrible where nuclear weapons would be used so that the American citizens and the other people in the world would get down on their knees and beg for no more war.
[01:02:19.433 --> 01:02:20.413]  What is the answer to that?
[01:02:20.433 --> 01:02:26.818]  They're going to be told the only way we can guarantee no more war is if we destroy the sovereignty of nations.
[01:02:27.598 --> 01:02:30.640]  And we come together as one humanity in a one world government.
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:31.060]  Right.
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:42.786]  And the usual suspects, these criminals like Christopher Wray and the rest of these traitors in Congress are more than happy to back it because it means a perennial authoritarian police state.
[01:02:43.046 --> 01:02:48.189]  There was already a heightened risk of violence in the United States before October 7th.
[01:02:49.129 --> 01:02:49.590]  Since then,
[01:02:50.694 --> 01:02:58.682]  We've seen a robes gallery of foreign terrorist organizations call for attacks against Americans and our allies.
[01:02:58.762 --> 01:03:01.365]  When I think about the USA, it should burn!
[01:03:01.405 --> 01:03:02.726]  Death to America!
[01:03:02.766 --> 01:03:04.948]  It could be death to or down with.
[01:03:05.289 --> 01:03:06.350]  So, can we get a...
[01:03:13.715 --> 01:03:19.879]  The point is, is that they've not been in offensive posture, but now they're not backing down.
[01:03:20.279 --> 01:03:30.486]  For the first time ever, Iran has struck and fired very sophisticated multiple re-entry device missiles that are designed to carry atomic weapons in a clear message to Israel.
[01:03:30.526 --> 01:03:34.108]  I don't think you disagree, but nobody else is saying this, that we can hit you with our weapons.
[01:03:34.629 --> 01:03:36.430]  This takes it into a whole other ballgame.
[01:03:38.331 --> 01:03:44.173]  They could launch another wave of drones a hundred times as large as the one that they launched.
[01:03:44.473 --> 01:03:47.455]  That's how many missiles and drones they have.
[01:03:48.055 --> 01:03:52.877]  They have very hyper-accurate missiles and drones.
[01:03:53.337 --> 01:03:56.679]  The Iranian technology is very advanced.
[01:03:57.459 --> 01:04:05.265]  And for those who don't know, they can have the atomic warheads detonate at 50,000 feet when no air defenses are even set to take them out.
[01:04:05.645 --> 01:04:07.747]  They're set to take them out at 20,000, 10,000 feet.
[01:04:08.187 --> 01:04:13.932]  Just the EMP event of that will knock out all the power and electrical systems of the defense systems.
[01:04:14.012 --> 01:04:16.694]  And then the next wave comes in and you can't stop them.
[01:04:16.714 --> 01:04:19.196]  Then they detonate at 1,000, 2,000 feet.
[01:04:19.736 --> 01:04:22.178]  And I think Iran is ready for nuclear war.
[01:04:22.658 --> 01:04:23.339]  So is Russia.
[01:04:23.379 --> 01:04:24.760]  This is so dangerous.
[01:04:25.399 --> 01:04:38.991]  If Israel is so reckless and suicidal and stupid as to launch a major attack against Iran, it'll only react in Russia, stepping, closing ranks, giving Iran whatever it needs, quietly.
[01:04:39.451 --> 01:04:41.353]  China doing the same thing, quietly.
[01:04:41.813 --> 01:04:47.298]  And Iran will then do another counter-strike, only this time, it may be a hundred times worse.
[01:04:47.498 --> 01:04:52.663]  And then say, if you keep this going, we'll hit you a thousand times worse.
[01:04:54.824 --> 01:05:01.608]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is back.
[01:05:01.828 --> 01:05:09.353]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, the platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulas, has returned to InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:05:46.302 --> 01:05:50.445]  Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc, Selenium, L-Glutamine, the list goes on.
[01:05:50.465 --> 01:05:51.966]  I don't even have time to list everything in here.
[01:05:51.986 --> 01:05:55.928]  So go to Impolewarestore.com and find out what Vitamin Mineral Fusion can do for you.
[01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:10.877]  We're now into hour number two, and Julian Assange's brother, Gabriel Shepton, is our guest.
[01:06:12.162 --> 01:06:26.671]  Here's Joe Biden just days ago saying he's considering dropping charges against political prisoner... President Biden, do you have a response to Australia's request that you end Julian Assange's prosecution?
[01:06:27.291 --> 01:06:30.553]  I didn't hear you.
[01:06:31.174 --> 01:06:35.256]  Do you have a response to Australia's request that you end Julian Assange's prosecution?
[01:06:35.336 --> 01:06:37.137]  I'm considering it.
[01:06:37.157 --> 01:06:38.618]  You're considering it?
[01:06:38.638 --> 01:06:39.759]  Do you have a response...
[01:06:55.862 --> 01:06:58.484]  We've been hearing for weeks that the Biden administration is considering this.
[01:06:58.504 --> 01:07:03.008]  We know Biden is pretty much a puppet, but to have him say it himself is encouraging.
[01:07:03.649 --> 01:07:07.932]  One of Trump's greatest failures was not pardoning or dropping charges against Julian Assange.
[01:07:07.952 --> 01:07:11.916]  He admits the CIA threatened him and he did in his war with the deep state.
[01:07:14.426 --> 01:07:16.389]  Gabriel Shempton is his brother.
[01:07:16.830 --> 01:07:19.494]  Julian Assange took the name of his stepfather.
[01:07:20.155 --> 01:07:26.285]  Gabriel Shempton is a film producer at the Shempton House, an adman for his brother and prison journalist and hero.
[01:07:27.987 --> 01:07:28.869]  He's also a publisher.
[01:07:30.168 --> 01:07:33.269]  He's at Gabriel Shempton on X. One word, Gabriel Shempton.
[01:07:33.289 --> 01:07:34.370]  We'll put that up on screen.
[01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:36.690]  You should definitely follow him there.
[01:07:37.391 --> 01:07:49.635]  Before we go to Gabriel, I wanted to play a clip of Julian Assange more than a decade ago before he was on self-induced prison and now many years in solitary confinement in prison for no crime.
[01:07:50.575 --> 01:07:54.597]  And here is Assange explaining the goal of Afghanistan is endless war.
[01:07:56.465 --> 01:08:00.426]  Because the goal is not to completely subjugate Afghanistan.
[01:08:00.866 --> 01:08:15.631]  The goal is to use Afghanistan to wash money out of the tax bases of the United States, out of the tax bases of European countries, through Afghanistan, and back into the hands of a transnational security alliance.
[01:08:15.811 --> 01:08:18.032]  That is the goal, i.e.
[01:08:18.052 --> 01:08:22.353]  the goal is to have an endless war, not a successful war.
[01:08:24.218 --> 01:08:27.179]  All right, so I'm very honored to have his brother on.
[01:08:27.199 --> 01:08:29.319]  I really admire Julian Assange.
[01:08:29.819 --> 01:08:35.440]  He has been through even more hell than myself, times a hundred, more than even President Trump.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:39.581]  Say what you want about me or Trump, we are targeted by the same deep state.
[01:08:40.562 --> 01:08:49.203]  So there are countless political prisoners now here in this country and around the world as the West goes pure, totalitarian, and mask off, gloves off.
[01:08:49.924 --> 01:08:50.624]  And so
[01:08:51.724 --> 01:09:00.011]  I think it's important to review what happened to Julian Assange and how he's vindicated with everything in the WikiLeaks they confirm is real and now what's come out since.
[01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:05.275]  Obviously Edward Snowden who hasn't paid the same price but they would have if they could have gotten him.
[01:09:06.116 --> 01:09:15.984]  And then also talk about currently what we can do to get Biden to do the right thing and it would be a political win for him.
[01:09:17.884 --> 01:09:22.910]  One of the few things they have right is that Assange is a good guy, not a bad guy.
[01:09:23.791 --> 01:09:25.012]  So this is a big deal.
[01:09:25.312 --> 01:09:29.397]  What do we do for Assange in solitary confinement right now?
[01:09:29.457 --> 01:09:31.079]  Because we are all Julian Assange.
[01:09:31.659 --> 01:09:33.441]  They're trying to get through him to get to us.
[01:09:33.482 --> 01:09:35.604]  That is not just something people say.
[01:09:35.684 --> 01:09:36.385]  That's the truth.
[01:09:38.598 --> 01:09:39.579]  I really appreciate you coming on.
[01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:53.649]  You can start wherever you want, but maybe about you and your brother, maybe why your brother did this, or humanizing him, what he's been through, how they set him up with the sex operatives, where all this is going, where he currently is.
[01:09:54.390 --> 01:10:05.038]  You can start anywhere you want, but I do, during this 50 minutes we have left with you, also want to go back and look at some of the incredible things that WikiLeaks did to expose the fact
[01:10:05.799 --> 01:10:13.986]  That our government knew there were no WMDs, our government's involved in so much other illegal spying, political operations.
[01:10:14.206 --> 01:10:20.110]  And you look at Daniel Ellsberg, who I've interviewed many times before he died, he was a hero for exposing.
[01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:22.993]  And he didn't get in trouble because it was the right thing to do.
[01:10:23.153 --> 01:10:27.136]  They knew the Vietnam War had been lost by 1968.
[01:10:27.396 --> 01:10:30.159]  They kept the war going for seven more years.
[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:32.800]  As a money laundering operation.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:36.862]  So how is your brother different than Daniel Ellsberg?
[01:10:36.942 --> 01:10:39.782]  He was in the Pentagon, but whistleblowers are protected.
[01:10:39.983 --> 01:10:41.243]  Your brother was a journalist.
[01:10:41.283 --> 01:10:43.244]  So, Gabriel, I've kind of set the table.
[01:10:43.604 --> 01:10:44.944]  We didn't talk before you came on.
[01:10:44.964 --> 01:10:45.904]  You just agreed to come on.
[01:10:46.224 --> 01:10:47.305]  You can begin wherever you want.
[01:10:47.345 --> 01:10:47.965]  Thank you so much.
[01:10:49.861 --> 01:10:52.022]  Yeah, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:10:52.142 --> 01:10:53.323]  Good to be here.
[01:10:54.804 --> 01:11:01.969]  Look, I guess we could go back, you know, Julian, ever since, you know, he's 11 years older than me.
[01:11:01.989 --> 01:11:02.969]  He's my older brother.
[01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:12.195]  And ever since, you know, we sort of got to know each other when I was in my late teens, and I've always had a lot of admiration for what
[01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:15.032]  He was up to the work that he was doing.
[01:11:16.013 --> 01:11:23.180]  Even in those early days, he was looking at ways to, how can we use technology, how can we use encryption to...
[01:11:32.179 --> 01:11:55.221]  He even made a cryptography program called Rubber Hose, which was a cryptography program that would allow, say if you had some secret information or some files that you needed to, that you were a whistleblower or journalist and you were being searched, that this program would allow you to hide that information and if you were being tortured,
[01:11:56.258 --> 01:12:11.694]  Uh, it would allow you to open a layer of the, a layer of the encryption and your torturers would assume that that's the information that you had, but it was also keep the information that was important safe, uh, and you would be able to escape with that information and, and share it with the world.
[01:12:13.234 --> 01:12:15.075]  Alright, he's in Australia.
[01:12:15.955 --> 01:12:17.015]  His Skype broke up.
[01:12:17.816 --> 01:12:34.862]  Let's reconnect with Gabriel right now and get him on so he can recap what he was saying and start off with where his brother began to wake up, what got him politically involved, what got him politically engaged.
[01:12:35.909 --> 01:12:40.653]  This is a long video, but I want to skip ahead towards the middle of the end where they're blowing up minivans of journalists.
[01:12:41.254 --> 01:12:48.459]  Let's roll a few minutes of... Let's hear clip 3, the short version, not the raw version of collateral damage.
[01:12:48.499 --> 01:12:48.860]  Here it is.
[01:12:55.045 --> 01:12:56.966]  ...behind that dirt pile break.
[01:12:58.988 --> 01:13:04.012]  We also took some RPG and stuff earlier, so just make sure you men keep your eyes open.
[01:13:07.265 --> 01:13:13.251]  Currently we're not being engaged, but just south of that location, right
[01:13:34.693 --> 01:13:39.336]  You should see dismounted elements with Humvees moving to the east.
[01:13:39.577 --> 01:13:39.857]  Over.
[01:13:40.758 --> 01:13:41.858]  This is Crazy Horse 1-8.
[01:13:41.878 --> 01:13:43.179]  We have elements in sight.
[01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:47.282]  I'm going to come down a little lower.
[01:13:47.402 --> 01:13:51.225]  I'm going to come down a little lower and take a quick enter.
[01:13:52.406 --> 01:13:54.508]  Roger that.
[01:13:54.548 --> 01:13:54.828]  This is 4.
[01:13:54.868 --> 01:13:58.411]  We're headed to the area where Crazy Horse engaged.
[01:14:06.158 --> 01:14:15.410]  Bushmaster 6, the SOTO 2-6 requests to go to the south to our original BT, so that if you flush them to the south, we will be there to intercept them.
[01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:22.619]  And this is Bushmaster 7, we're coming up on the B, the aft end of the branch.
[01:14:29.744 --> 01:14:34.529]  Alright, so it's the murder of journalists and things that Julian Assange exposed.
[01:14:34.549 --> 01:14:35.511]  That's why they were so mad at him.
[01:14:35.851 --> 01:14:37.453]  Gabriel, your Skype broke up some.
[01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:43.019]  Kind of recap what got him involved, what got him engaged, how he begun, and then this whole saga.
[01:14:43.459 --> 01:14:44.641]  Again, the brother of Julian Assange.
[01:14:44.961 --> 01:14:45.522]  Please continue.
[01:14:48.516 --> 01:15:00.038]  Well, I think where I was going was that he's always been using technology, his skills as a technologist, to educate people, get access to information, to truthful information.
[01:15:01.039 --> 01:15:06.925]  And bring that to the public and protect sources and protect journalists in the process.
[01:15:07.786 --> 01:15:12.451]  And so that's in 2006 was when he started Wikileaks.
[01:15:13.172 --> 01:15:21.981]  There's a famous white paper, the famous Wikileaks white paper now, which is called Conspiracy and Government, which outlined the
[01:15:22.902 --> 01:15:37.811]  It really outlined the problems, the perceived problems with these conspiracies that exist within government, conspiracies between the security elite, the media corporations,
[01:15:38.707 --> 01:15:41.069]  And government to govern.
[01:15:41.129 --> 01:15:47.794]  And how to deconstruct those conspiracies was by increasing their secrecy cost.
[01:15:48.335 --> 01:15:57.282]  So by increasing the secrecy cost of these conspiracies, they would become more and more inefficient and start to break down.
[01:15:57.382 --> 01:16:04.788]  And it was really that white paper that led to the development of Wikileaks, this combination of
[01:16:05.688 --> 01:16:22.159]  Jurisdictional arbitrage in a press freedom sense combined with encryption and using the architecture of the internet to make this Wikileaks website that was uncensorable.
[01:16:22.919 --> 01:16:29.103]  It couldn't be taken down and even to this day the Wikileaks archives exist online.
[01:16:29.143 --> 01:16:29.844]  But Julian really
[01:16:30.876 --> 01:16:39.900]  He believes that through knowledge is the only way that our societies can right themselves, can make themselves better.
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:52.165]  And so that's essentially why he developed WikiLeaks, so that we as people, as humans, are able to find out what our governments or these institutions are doing in our name.
[01:16:53.145 --> 01:17:02.187]  And then correct course if they're not doing something that we don't want or that we believe is morally corrupt or exposing their crimes.
[01:17:02.227 --> 01:17:10.589]  So I've been able to get that knowledge to people so that we can make a better society for ourselves.
[01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:20.032]  And that's really what I think Julian was always concerned about, is how do we make the world better for the people who are living in it?
[01:17:21.699 --> 01:17:24.502]  And fundamentally, I think that's why they feared your brother so much.
[01:17:24.562 --> 01:17:30.827]  So professional, doing such a great job, betting everything, nothing he ever put out turned out to be fake or false.
[01:17:30.887 --> 01:17:34.350]  We know the famous Karl Rove stuff with Bush Jr.
[01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:41.296]  was to put fake stuff in a real file to discredit all his other real, you know, horrible activities in the Texas Air National Guard.
[01:17:41.716 --> 01:17:42.737]  That's a classic tactic.
[01:17:43.077 --> 01:17:47.741]  Your brother and his team was able to navigate that over and over again and had such incredible
[01:17:48.618 --> 01:17:48.938]  Thank you.
[01:18:06.414 --> 01:18:17.621]  Well, Julian was a pioneer of this technique of using encryption, this architecture of the internet, to bring more transparency to governments around the world.
[01:18:18.461 --> 01:18:23.204]  And he was exposing corrupt people and they couldn't control him.
[01:18:23.744 --> 01:18:31.606]  You know, Wikileaks wasn't under the control of these corporate institutions that exist in the media landscape now.
[01:18:31.626 --> 01:18:36.627]  There was no advertising revenue, so there was no control from advertisers.
[01:18:37.208 --> 01:18:50.031]  And he was able to, I guess almost copying the techniques that were used by the intelligence community to play stories around the world, he would use those techniques as well to bring
[01:18:51.292 --> 01:18:52.333]  It was really a sort of
[01:19:04.119 --> 01:19:13.125]  This watershed moment in history where the control over the media landscape was lost for a time.
[01:19:13.206 --> 01:19:18.569]  There was no control over the corporate media landscape in that effect.
[01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:23.193]  These documents were on Wikileaks for everyone to see.
[01:19:23.213 --> 01:19:24.954]  They couldn't be spun.
[01:19:25.714 --> 01:19:27.396]  Julian called it scientific journalism.
[01:19:27.896 --> 01:19:33.440]  When you do a scientific study, you have the data to back it up and it can be peer-reviewed.
[01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:48.495]  But what Wikileaks did was similar, that they would put the leaked document up and so that you could peer review journalism, you could peer review these journalistic articles, see where the spin was, see where the bias was, see what was true or false.
[01:19:48.895 --> 01:19:55.002]  And I think that's why he is so feared, is because he exposed the crimes and he was uncensorable.
[01:19:55.748 --> 01:20:05.214]  Well, that's right, and he beat them at their own game, but instead of lying, he told the truth, which really shows how it's a paper tiger, this military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned about.
[01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:10.718]  If there is any checks and balances, any media doing their job, it would stop this system.
[01:20:10.738 --> 01:20:13.039]  But, oh, they're so scared of checks and balances.
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:14.540]  You're hosting right now.
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:15.221]  You're the expert.
[01:20:15.241 --> 01:20:15.801]  You're his brother.
[01:20:17.641 --> 01:20:21.926]  But people never really talk about his childhood or him or what makes him tick.
[01:20:21.966 --> 01:20:35.360]  Maybe spend a few minutes on your brother and why he's been so unbreakable under incredible solitary confinement, which they report is the worst form of long-term torture, and then currently where he is and what we can do for him.
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:53.587]  Well, yeah, I, you know, Julian, you know, every time I can't, I'm in so much admiration for Julian and his strength and his, you know, his compassion, his thoughtfulness and, you know, his
[01:20:54.227 --> 01:20:55.607]  He's a gentle genius.
[01:20:56.407 --> 01:21:02.669]  He's a gentle genius who just wanted or wants to bring more justice to the world.
[01:21:03.129 --> 01:21:08.610]  And that's always been, I think, at the core of the things that he's been doing.
[01:21:08.690 --> 01:21:18.772]  I mean, he's been in now in a prison for five years and before that seven years in Ecuadorian embassy and under house arrest before that.
[01:21:18.792 --> 01:21:22.793]  So we're looking at 14 years where he's been detained one way or another.
[01:21:23.934 --> 01:21:26.659]  And these last five years have been incredibly tough on him.
[01:21:26.679 --> 01:21:32.831]  He's been in a two metre by three metre cell most of his time, you know, 21 to 22 hours a day.
[01:21:35.656 --> 01:21:37.258]  In a maximum security prison.
[01:21:37.318 --> 01:21:39.621]  He's not charged with anything in the United Kingdom.
[01:21:39.641 --> 01:21:41.443]  He's not serving a sentence.
[01:21:41.483 --> 01:21:42.544]  He hasn't been convicted.
[01:21:43.024 --> 01:21:44.686]  He has never even got a parking fine.
[01:21:45.407 --> 01:21:53.636]  And he's being kept there solely at the request of the US Department of Justice in relation to this extradition.
[01:21:54.614 --> 01:21:55.794]  And it's been wearing him down.
[01:21:56.895 --> 01:22:09.359]  In 2019, when he first went to the prison, there's a UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Nils Melser, went to see Julian in the prison and took two expert doctors there with him.
[01:22:09.819 --> 01:22:18.162]  And these are doctors who usually go to these third world countries or places where there's authoritarian regimes.
[01:22:18.722 --> 01:22:23.243]  And assess situations there where there might be someone undergoing some type of torture.
[01:22:23.663 --> 01:22:32.345]  But they were going into a prison in London to assess whether Julian was suffering the effects of torture.
[01:22:32.365 --> 01:22:39.307]  And those independent experts found that Julian was suffering the effects of psychological torture.
[01:22:39.867 --> 01:22:42.569]  And his situation hasn't changed.
[01:22:43.049 --> 01:22:47.051]  So that psychological torture continues to this day.
[01:22:47.091 --> 01:22:56.036]  And Nils Melzer, the UN Special Rapporteur, the former one, actually called it a slow motion murder before our very eyes.
[01:22:56.556 --> 01:23:01.459]  That's what is going on, what is happening to Julian right now in that prison.
[01:23:01.519 --> 01:23:02.559]  It's a slow motion murder.
[01:23:02.579 --> 01:23:07.002]  I went to see him at the end of February inside the prison
[01:23:09.872 --> 01:23:12.616]  It's really heartbreaking.
[01:23:13.397 --> 01:23:20.568]  It's heartbreaking to see him locked up like that for just publishing truthful information.
[01:23:21.575 --> 01:23:23.176]  You know, wanting to help people.
[01:23:23.737 --> 01:23:27.460]  This is the punishment that he's receiving and it's wearing him down.
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:31.162]  You know, he's in a very, very delicate position health-wise.
[01:23:32.463 --> 01:23:41.290]  You know, it just really upsets me actually to talk about it, to talk about going and seeing him there in the prison.
[01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:42.691]  Now, I think
[01:23:43.709 --> 01:23:45.130]  What people can do in the U.S.
[01:23:45.210 --> 01:23:53.737]  is, you know, there's a resolution before the House, the House Resolution 934, and we're encouraging all the supporters across the U.S.
[01:23:53.917 --> 01:23:57.420]  to contact their representative, ask them to sign on to that resolution.
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:58.961]  We're trying to get 20 co-sponsors.
[01:23:59.482 --> 01:24:01.864]  I think we're up to 11 at the moment.
[01:24:02.104 --> 01:24:04.706]  It's a bipartisan resolution.
[01:24:04.766 --> 01:24:08.970]  So, yeah, taking part in that and that lobbying effort I think is really key.
[01:24:10.951 --> 01:24:15.594]  Yes, with these types of lobbying of representatives.
[01:24:15.614 --> 01:24:32.646]  And I think that will send a message to the Biden administration that there is a lot of support for this prosecution being dropped and that the political cost of pursuing Julian actually outweighs the cost of them dropping it.
[01:24:32.746 --> 01:24:36.188]  So I think that's what really needs to happen to change Julian's
[01:24:37.969 --> 01:24:47.817]  It's up to the DOJ and they have to make their final decision to withdraw the charges and bring them to an end.
[01:24:52.651 --> 01:24:54.592]  Now, I've been asking some of the questions here.
[01:24:54.873 --> 01:24:57.274]  Again, Julian Assange's brother is here with us right now.
[01:24:57.915 --> 01:24:59.636]  Gabriel, you've got the floor.
[01:24:59.776 --> 01:25:00.957]  Where do you want to go with this?
[01:25:01.057 --> 01:25:02.678]  Because there's so much people want to know.
[01:25:02.758 --> 01:25:03.559]  I just thought of this.
[01:25:04.239 --> 01:25:07.922]  I'm going to post on X here in a moment on Real Alex Jones to my listeners.
[01:25:08.302 --> 01:25:15.127]  If you have questions for Gabriel Shempton, Julian Assange's brother, we'll take some of their questions.
[01:25:15.187 --> 01:25:17.929]  But you've got the floor here to millions of people.
[01:25:18.009 --> 01:25:18.790]  What else do you want to hit?
[01:25:21.664 --> 01:25:31.875]  Well, I think it's important to really understand what's happening to Julian now and what has been this sort of persecution around Julian after publishing this information back in 2010-2011.
[01:25:34.265 --> 01:25:50.010]  That's information about the war in Iraq, undocumented civilian deaths in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, torture in Guantanamo Bay, and these diplomatic cables, the 250,000 diplomatic cables which expose this global corruption network.
[01:25:58.826 --> 01:26:03.908]  I think what's important to understand about Julian is that his persecution is almost like another leak.
[01:26:04.648 --> 01:26:29.384]  You know, it's showing what is actually, what the links that our institutions or the institutions around the world can be corrupted to pursue someone who does this sort of thing, whether you're looking at the Crown Prosecuting Service in the United Kingdom, the UK judiciary, which has been, I think Julian's had faced 28 judges in the UK.
[01:26:30.992 --> 01:26:35.876]  And only one has ever ruled, you know, they've all ruled against him except for one.
[01:26:36.636 --> 01:26:45.062]  So it really exposes the level at which our institutions are vulnerable to this sort of corruption.
[01:26:45.082 --> 01:26:49.425]  I was about to say, isn't the current judge has been involved with MI6 covering up spying?
[01:26:50.586 --> 01:26:55.550]  I've seen reports that the judges are intimately involved in the apparatus of MI6 themselves.
[01:26:57.014 --> 01:27:02.958]  Yeah, well, I mean, the judges in the United Kingdom, they all go to the same schools, they all come from the same clubs.
[01:27:03.139 --> 01:27:10.204]  It's that sort of hierarchy or community there.
[01:27:10.304 --> 01:27:11.805]  They all know each other.
[01:27:13.386 --> 01:27:20.892]  One of the judges was actually an MI6 lawyer, I think is what you might be referring to, and so now he's a High Court judge, but that's not uncommon.
[01:27:21.632 --> 01:27:32.417]  A previous judge that ruled against Julian was actually a roommate of the minister who was in charge of the operation to expel Julian from the embassy.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:48.065]  In the United Kingdom, you have all these types of links between the ruling elite there, which is, you know, it's not uncommon.
[01:27:48.085 --> 01:27:57.210]  I think with the UK judiciary, it's sort of given a bit of standing that I don't think it really deserves.
[01:27:58.691 --> 01:28:04.776]  But they've been, you know, the willing participants in this and really almost the jailers and the torturers of Julian.
[01:28:05.657 --> 01:28:07.418]  They've been the ones keeping him in prison.
[01:28:07.918 --> 01:28:15.224]  They've been the ones who are extending this legal process that's gone on for five years and could go on for years more.
[01:28:15.684 --> 01:28:17.306]  Well, clearly we've got to go to break, sir.
[01:28:17.326 --> 01:28:17.826]  Stay right there.
[01:28:17.846 --> 01:28:18.927]  We're coming right back in just a few minutes.
[01:28:19.287 --> 01:28:20.969]  They want to send a message to everybody else.
[01:28:21.569 --> 01:28:24.872]  You leak, you expose crimes, we're going to throw you under the prison.
[01:28:25.652 --> 01:28:28.213]  And so that's why we're all Julian Assange.
[01:28:28.233 --> 01:28:29.593]  I want to get your take on Biden.
[01:28:30.294 --> 01:28:44.799]  What the word is, are they going to drop these charges after 14 years in one form of confinement or another, five plus years in solitary confinement, or are they going to continue to just double down on evil?
[01:28:46.226 --> 01:28:49.132]  Julian Assange basically universally is loved, left and right.
[01:28:49.553 --> 01:28:50.475]  People see right through it.
[01:28:50.495 --> 01:28:51.958]  I would call him a classical liberal.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.782]  I just want to meet him in person.
[01:28:53.863 --> 01:28:55.205]  Someday when he's free, we'll be right back.
[01:28:58.857 --> 01:29:00.318]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is back.

[01:30:58.753 --> 01:30:59.693]  Hello Americans.
[01:31:00.494 --> 01:31:08.920]  I want to share with you a story a story about inflammation the silent menace that lurks within our bodies affecting our health and well-being.
[01:31:10.081 --> 01:31:15.865]  Inflammation the root cause of countless ailments quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[01:31:16.923 --> 01:31:20.986]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues.
[01:31:21.446 --> 01:31:24.608]  From heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[01:31:25.608 --> 01:31:29.611]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature.
[01:31:30.311 --> 01:31:33.193]  A remedy that has stood the test of time, turmeric.

[01:31:59.224 --> 01:32:04.671]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[01:32:05.432 --> 01:32:09.718]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[01:32:10.119 --> 01:32:14.284]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:15.926 --> 01:32:18.707]  So many people have serious issues.
[01:32:18.967 --> 01:32:20.107]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[01:32:20.547 --> 01:32:25.949]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[01:32:26.489 --> 01:32:31.890]  Most other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:35.271]  But this is pure atomic certified
[01:32:37.196 --> 01:32:38.497]  I don't know.
[01:32:38.537 --> 01:32:41.178]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[01:32:41.558 --> 01:32:44.700]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now for this product being here.
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:50.142]  It funds the InfoWar, but I guarantee you, you take this for a few weeks, you will feel the difference.
[01:32:50.302 --> 01:32:51.103]  It is amazing.
[01:32:51.423 --> 01:32:57.426]  It's the Missing Link X2, back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:32:57.866 --> 01:32:58.266]  X2.
[01:33:00.347 --> 01:33:06.250]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.314 --> 01:33:20.317]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:23.519 --> 01:33:31.463]  Alright, I just thought of this 10 minutes ago, but we posted on my real Alex Jones account, the Julian Assange's brother, Gabriel Shempton.
[01:33:34.705 --> 01:33:35.626]  What are your questions?
[01:33:36.346 --> 01:33:39.048]  And a lot of them are coming in, I've got some of those coming up.
[01:33:40.117 --> 01:33:42.099]  But I'm really getting the same question over and over again.
[01:33:42.479 --> 01:33:43.580]  What's your brother like?
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:44.281]  How do we help him?
[01:33:44.321 --> 01:33:50.847]  We've kind of already covered that, but let's drill back in what I played right when the interview started 25 minutes ago, 30 minutes ago.
[01:33:51.628 --> 01:33:57.273]  Biden, we've heard for a month or so, is looking to maybe drop charges or whatever.
[01:33:57.773 --> 01:33:59.195]  He said, yes, we're looking at it.
[01:33:59.515 --> 01:34:01.537]  What is the latest information on that, sir?
[01:34:03.885 --> 01:34:07.948]  Well I think that statement from the President took us all a bit by surprise really.
[01:34:10.690 --> 01:34:23.078]  There's so much happening in the world that to have him even considering these Australian requests, the Australian Government has been advocating for Julian's release.
[01:34:24.018 --> 01:34:38.448]  For a couple of years now, actually, the Prime Minister and other members of the government, the Australian Attorney General, has even advocated directly with the DOJ in the United States.
[01:34:39.088 --> 01:34:44.412]  The Australian Parliament issued a statement, or did a resolution actually, where two-thirds of the Parliament
[01:34:46.448 --> 01:34:46.668]  I think.
[01:35:00.262 --> 01:35:03.624]  Yeah, we were all a little bit surprised to hear that he was considering it.
[01:35:03.664 --> 01:35:18.631]  There have been several reports now in the Wall Street Journal that there were sources from the DOJ, you know, about these so-called plea deals or these sort of off-ramps that the DOJ would like to put forward.
[01:35:18.671 --> 01:35:23.513]  But yeah, I mean, Julian's lawyers, when those deals were first
[01:35:24.533 --> 01:35:32.416]  Rumored in the Wall Street Journal, Julian's lawyers said they didn't know anything about those deals and that they had no communication with the DOJ.
[01:35:32.476 --> 01:35:39.258]  So I think what we're seeing now is some real movement around this, you know, a real movement around the case.
[01:35:40.138 --> 01:35:46.640]  And, you know, I think for the first time, it feels like we're pretty, pretty close to a resolution here.
[01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:50.962]  But I think what is important to go back and really
[01:35:51.912 --> 01:35:53.614]  Like, get to where this came from.
[01:35:53.654 --> 01:35:56.697]  Where did this prosecution, you know, actually come from?
[01:35:57.518 --> 01:36:07.568]  And it was back in 2017 when WikiLeaks published Vault 7, which was these CIA hacking tools.
[01:36:08.189 --> 01:36:12.894]  And Gabriel, I want you to stop right there because we're on a lot of radio stations, a lot of...
[01:36:13.922 --> 01:36:15.964]  Gabriel Shepton is our guest.
[01:36:16.024 --> 01:36:18.806]  Gabriel Shepton is the brother of Julian Assange.
[01:36:19.186 --> 01:36:21.888]  I've seen a big thing on X saying, well he doesn't have the same last name.
[01:36:21.929 --> 01:36:22.529]  How's his brother?
[01:36:23.009 --> 01:36:23.830]  I've been remarried.
[01:36:24.190 --> 01:36:25.291]  I've got two wives.
[01:36:25.331 --> 01:36:26.312]  I've got four children with him.
[01:36:27.313 --> 01:36:28.374]  You're on record as brother.
[01:36:28.854 --> 01:36:30.155]  You're on record as advocate.
[01:36:30.495 --> 01:36:32.677]  There's a whole other conspiracy theory that you're not his brother.
[01:36:32.737 --> 01:36:35.219]  This is the level of serious ignorance.
[01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:36.921]  Gabriel Shepton at
[01:36:37.561 --> 01:36:42.826]  On X, Gabriel Shipton, S-H-I-P-T-O-N, is his brother.
[01:36:42.846 --> 01:36:45.128]  And it's important, I want you to start over.
[01:36:45.188 --> 01:36:46.289]  I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm going to shut up.
[01:36:47.116 --> 01:36:57.802]  Go back to what, 15 years ago or whatever it was, the CIA sex operatives they had met, how this all began, how he 15 years later is still locked up without a trial.
[01:36:58.422 --> 01:37:07.648]  And you're right, they really went crazy with Vault 7, the huge CIA spy grid backing up what Snowden was saying, all the illegal activity, the CIA spoofing people.
[01:37:08.528 --> 01:37:19.993]  And then walking through kind of some of the biggest things WikiLeaks did, exposing 2016 Hillary, and the weird Aleister Crowley stuff, and you know, we'll have the kids ready for you in the hot tub at the farmhouse.
[01:37:20.273 --> 01:37:22.414]  They're seven years old, they're ready to service you.
[01:37:22.855 --> 01:37:24.936]  I mean, this is stuff the media never wanted to address.
[01:37:25.276 --> 01:37:32.319]  This is hardcore, so I'm going to be quiet now, Gabriel Shipton, but start over here with that, please.
[01:37:35.029 --> 01:37:41.310]  Well, I guess it all starts with the publishing of this information, these leaks by Chelsea Manning.
[01:37:41.950 --> 01:37:54.053]  So Chelsea Manning, who leaked this information back in 2010, 2011, she actually tried to take it to the New York Times and they didn't want the information, so she ended up going to WikiLeaks.
[01:37:54.073 --> 01:37:58.554]  So WikiLeaks is sort of this publisher of last resort in that sense.
[01:37:58.614 --> 01:38:02.615]  And that's really, like, if you want to track the timeline of this persecution,
[01:38:03.575 --> 01:38:16.646]  When Julian started publishing this information, and when Wikileaks started publishing this leaked information, is when the crackdown and the attacks on Julian personally, but also on Wikileaks, really began.
[01:38:16.666 --> 01:38:23.412]  We saw an international financial, extra-legal banking blockade.
[01:38:24.116 --> 01:38:25.577]  That was led by John McCain.
[01:38:26.957 --> 01:38:31.339]  Visa MasterCard cutting off Wikileaks.
[01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:33.580]  Wikileaks was surviving on donations.
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:35.301]  It never took advertising money or anything.
[01:38:36.001 --> 01:38:38.182]  It's solely supported by its readers.
[01:38:39.142 --> 01:38:45.145]  They cut off the MasterCard, cut off Visa, closed Julian's personal bank accounts, shut down their PayPal.
[01:38:45.945 --> 01:38:51.626]  Really came after Wikileaks with the full force that they were capable of.
[01:38:52.187 --> 01:38:59.128]  And it was then that these allegations in Sweden came up.
[01:38:59.968 --> 01:39:03.529]  During that time, Julian was invited to the United Kingdom.
[01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:19.157]  And there was these allegations, these sexual allegations against him by these two women who actually later admitted that they didn't want to bring any investigation into it.
[01:39:20.204 --> 01:39:28.909]  But Julian went for questioning at the time with the Swedish police and he was given the all clear to leave the country.
[01:39:29.829 --> 01:39:36.533]  The investigation was closed and it was actually while he was in the air, flying from Sweden to the UK,
[01:39:37.373 --> 01:39:54.566]  That they secretly reopened the investigation, issued an Interpol Red Notice for Julian under the European Arrest Warrant system, and when Julian landed is when he started to having to fight his first, you know, these extradition
[01:39:55.746 --> 01:39:58.187]  Yeah, these extradition attempts against him.
[01:39:58.767 --> 01:40:06.190]  And it's actually interesting that when he was on that flight from Sweden to the United Kingdom, all his baggage went missing.
[01:40:06.230 --> 01:40:15.753]  And there's actually a lot of unpublished material, video evidence of massacres and things like that, that all went missing on that flight.
[01:40:15.793 --> 01:40:16.173]  And I think
[01:40:17.173 --> 01:40:33.183]  You know, that famous collateral murder video is the video that you showed earlier, the helicopter gunship mowing down those two Reuters journalists, and then also shooting up the van that came to rescue them, which actually had children in it as well.
[01:40:34.263 --> 01:40:35.844]  We would have seen more videos like that.
[01:40:35.864 --> 01:40:41.928]  We would have seen much more video information if Julian's luggage hadn't gone missing.
[01:40:43.029 --> 01:40:43.669]  On that flight.
[01:40:44.530 --> 01:40:50.216]  But that was the longest running preliminary investigation in Swedish history.
[01:40:50.937 --> 01:40:52.579]  It ran for seven years.
[01:40:52.599 --> 01:40:55.782]  It was open and closed four times.
[01:40:56.783 --> 01:40:57.925]  Different prosecutors.
[01:40:58.686 --> 01:41:02.490]  There was actually some emails, email communication.
[01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:07.031]  between the Crown Prosecuting Service and the Swedish Prosecuting Service.
[01:41:07.451 --> 01:41:12.892]  So all that Sweden had to do to further the investigation and to close it was to come and question Julian.
[01:41:13.272 --> 01:41:15.773]  But they would refuse to do that inside the Embassy.
[01:41:16.493 --> 01:41:27.635]  And so there was this email communication back and forth from the Swedish prosecutors to the Crown prosecutors and there's an email out there, email evidence from the Crown prosecutors
[01:41:28.275 --> 01:41:38.582]  The Swedes are trying to pull out, they're trying to get out of it, and the Crown Prosecutor sends them an email saying, don't get cold feet, this is about more than a simple extradition, you know.
[01:41:38.602 --> 01:41:48.869]  And so that's email evidence there that there was a conspiracy the whole time to keep Julian inside the Ecuadorian Embassy using this
[01:41:50.208 --> 01:41:57.033]  You know, this Swedish investigation and this extradition attempt to Sweden.
[01:41:57.113 --> 01:42:09.821]  And it was when Julian was taken from the embassy in 2019 is when they, you know, threw up their hands and said, oh, we don't have enough evidence to continue this investigation and we're going to now close the investigation.
[01:42:09.861 --> 01:42:13.564]  But by that time, the US had revealed their indictment.
[01:42:14.905 --> 01:42:23.777]  And the charges that Julian feared the whole time, which is why he sought asylum in the embassy, you know, were brought down.
[01:42:24.618 --> 01:42:27.361]  I was about to say, clearly, clearly...
[01:42:30.874 --> 01:42:36.019]  Other people, like Edward Snowden, saw what happened to your brother and they ran to Russia, which is sad.
[01:42:36.039 --> 01:42:36.940]  You've got to run to Russia.
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:44.068]  That's obviously got some authoritarian issues, but compared to the West, it's very, very sad.
[01:42:44.528 --> 01:42:47.732]  I've got a lot of questions here for you, but I want to go back to Biden.
[01:42:48.903 --> 01:42:55.833]  What do you think this audience can do with Biden signaling, because he knows it's incredibly popular, your brother's been tortured for being a hero.
[01:42:56.494 --> 01:42:57.475]  What do you think we can do?
[01:42:57.575 --> 01:42:58.256]  Call Congress?
[01:42:58.296 --> 01:43:01.200]  Call Biden to get them to drop these charges?
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:03.864]  And what do you think your brother's going to do if they drop the charges?
[01:43:06.687 --> 01:43:18.212]  Yeah, so we're asking people to call their representatives, call their Congressperson, ask them to sign on to Resolution 934, House Resolution 934, ask them to get on it, co-sponsor it.
[01:43:19.253 --> 01:43:22.234]  We're really building the constituency for dueling in Congress now.
[01:43:22.254 --> 01:43:24.415]  We've got about 20 Congress people who are all supporting
[01:43:25.656 --> 01:43:36.163]  All supporting Julian's freedom and we really want to grow that to show that there is political goodwill out there for these charges to be dropped.
[01:43:36.183 --> 01:43:47.131]  Because we know it exists but having that in Congress I think is very important and will send a message not just to the President but also to the Department of Justice.
[01:43:47.191 --> 01:43:49.833]  But I think it's important to go back to that 2017 time.
[01:43:52.345 --> 01:44:04.230]  When they published these Vault 7 leaks, Mike Pompeo was the new CIA Director and in his very first speech as CIA Director, he made
[01:44:08.471 --> 01:44:18.544]  It basically went off the deep end, essentially, and said, we're going to go after Wikileaks, we're going to go after Julian with everything we've got.
[01:44:18.584 --> 01:44:21.808]  They called them a non-state hostile intelligence agency.
[01:44:21.868 --> 01:44:27.815]  And what that actual, that was actually a legal term that we didn't know at the time, but what that actually meant,
[01:44:28.482 --> 01:44:31.825]  And Gabriel, let me just back you up there, because we haven't broke this yet, but Congress
[01:44:54.864 --> 01:44:56.245]  is set to have hearings on this.
[01:44:56.745 --> 01:44:57.625]  I've confirmed this.
[01:44:57.665 --> 01:45:04.889]  I can't talk about it in detail, but I remember seven years ago when they said I was a Russian agent with no proof in the Armed Services House Committee.
[01:45:06.010 --> 01:45:12.573]  We've now learned that that's what I've been designated with as a non-state hostile intelligence agency.
[01:45:13.414 --> 01:45:15.835]  And so we know they said Trump was that as well.
[01:45:15.855 --> 01:45:21.618]  Instead of just saying he's a Russian agent with no proof, now they just go, no, you're just a hostile state or hostile group.
[01:45:21.758 --> 01:45:23.539]  You mean hostile to
[01:45:24.199 --> 01:45:27.162]  This rogue government intelligence agency operation.
[01:45:27.182 --> 01:45:29.764]  That's why I say your brother is patient zero.
[01:45:29.824 --> 01:45:39.433]  And you know, it's come out recently, the FBI and CIA has been running these huge disinformation campaigns against me, making up things I never did, funding lawsuits, doing it.
[01:45:39.773 --> 01:45:47.781]  If they are able to do this to your brother, and then there's actually the Wall Street Journal six years ago, they said, once we get Julian Assange and the left doesn't stand up,
[01:45:48.769 --> 01:45:50.770]  Then we get Jones and the right doesn't stand up.
[01:45:51.131 --> 01:45:52.151]  We'll be able to get them all.
[01:45:52.492 --> 01:45:53.833]  That was a big Wall Street Journal article.
[01:45:53.873 --> 01:45:57.615]  So this is a long-term strategic plan to set the table.
[01:45:58.096 --> 01:46:02.159]  An egalitarian system targets a few people first to set the precedent.
[01:46:02.439 --> 01:46:07.002]  That's why your brother isn't just a hero, but he also represents all of us.
[01:46:07.242 --> 01:46:12.626]  And so, again, nothing compared to your brother, but they would like to do everything to me they've done to your brother.
[01:46:12.666 --> 01:46:16.509]  That's why I have particular interest and particular empathy here.
[01:46:18.953 --> 01:46:19.833]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:20.754 --> 01:46:30.719]  So at that time is when they installed high-definition cameras all throughout the embassy, where Julian... And the CIA was spying on him internally, remember that came out?
[01:46:31.079 --> 01:46:43.506]  That they secretly had a group... High-definition cameras, the security company that was meant to be protecting Julian was co-opted by the CIA and they installed microphones everywhere inside the embassy.
[01:46:43.526 --> 01:46:46.508]  You would go to visit Julian and you would have to hand over your phone
[01:46:47.188 --> 01:46:49.009]  So your brother is a microcosm of all of this?
[01:47:15.427 --> 01:47:25.632]  Exactly, but it gets worse because they were actually planning, there was sketches, reportedly sketches drawn up within the CIA to murder Julian.
[01:47:26.892 --> 01:47:29.814]  And that was confirmed by these Yahoo News journalists.
[01:47:31.661 --> 01:47:42.085]  And in these reports, 30 former, current and former intelligence agency workers confirmed that these sketches existed from within the CIA.
[01:47:42.105 --> 01:47:46.907]  There were even plots to kidnap Julian from the Ecuadorian embassy.
[01:47:47.667 --> 01:47:51.289]  And these plots to kidnap Julian made it as high as the White House.
[01:47:51.909 --> 01:48:01.874]  And this Yahoo News report goes into those conversations that happened and the DOJ at the time said, well, if you kidnap him from the embassy, what are you going to do with him?
[01:48:01.914 --> 01:48:03.474]  You can't just put him in Guantanamo.
[01:48:03.514 --> 01:48:05.195]  You can't take him to one of our black sites.
[01:48:05.836 --> 01:48:13.079]  Let us get this indictment together so that when he comes out of the prison, we've got something to charge him with.
[01:48:13.619 --> 01:48:19.461]  And so, you can see this sort of progression of the political nature of this prosecution.
[01:48:19.481 --> 01:48:22.161]  Sure, they're hysterical because he's exposing their crimes.
[01:48:22.221 --> 01:48:22.962]  Let me ask you this.
[01:48:24.322 --> 01:48:27.603]  Why do you think Biden, at least on the surface, is saying he may drop charges?
[01:48:28.063 --> 01:48:31.024]  Is that because of his political nature?
[01:48:31.124 --> 01:48:34.505]  Or is that just a diversion?
[01:48:34.525 --> 01:48:37.006]  I know you don't know, but what do you think?
[01:48:37.066 --> 01:48:38.906]  And I should ask you this question after that.
[01:48:39.306 --> 01:48:40.787]  When's the last time you talked to your brother?
[01:48:40.847 --> 01:48:41.407]  How is he doing?
[01:48:44.417 --> 01:48:48.419]  Well, I think it's because of the requests from Australia.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:57.665]  Essentially, it's the Australian government and the Australian population who are requesting this of the United States.
[01:48:58.005 --> 01:49:00.406]  And that was the framing of that question, right?
[01:49:00.426 --> 01:49:05.749]  Like, are you considering the Australians' requests to drop the charges against Julian?
[01:49:05.769 --> 01:49:08.751]  I mean, Julian's incredibly popular in Australia.
[01:49:08.771 --> 01:49:13.454]  90% of the population, you know, in the polling, 90% of the population wants him back.
[01:49:14.174 --> 01:49:36.494]  And I think Australia is incredibly strategically important to the United States at the moment, particularly in regard to the mineral resources that are there, securing those mineral resources, you know, the rare metals, lithium, titanium, all these types of things that are needed are all found in Australia.
[01:49:38.275 --> 01:49:42.998]  They're necessary for the China containment, the current China containment strategies.
[01:49:44.038 --> 01:49:57.165]  And so this is the one sticking point with the Australians is like, well, you know, you need us for this, you know, you need our resources, you need us for this China containment, but you're actually, you know, abusing one of our citizens.
[01:49:57.205 --> 01:49:59.887]  So it sort of doesn't gel for many Australians.
[01:49:59.907 --> 01:50:06.290]  And I think the pressure and from coming from Australia and that relationship
[01:50:06.930 --> 01:50:07.511]  Absolutely.
[01:50:07.571 --> 01:50:14.617]  So I want to talk about the timetable here and the time we have left.
[01:50:14.637 --> 01:50:16.719]  You've got to come back again and this is so important.
[01:50:16.739 --> 01:50:17.399]  It's great to have you.
[01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:20.522]  We have Julian Assange's brother with us right now, Gabriel Shipton.
[01:50:21.063 --> 01:50:29.490]  But Gabriel, looking at this, your brother has already run a thousand mile marathon.
[01:50:32.037 --> 01:50:34.359]  I know that they know he's a man of his word.
[01:50:34.379 --> 01:50:35.400]  I think he's done enough.
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:37.302]  The problem is he's such a hero.
[01:50:37.362 --> 01:50:38.202]  He's so strong.
[01:50:38.543 --> 01:50:39.444]  They've almost killed him.
[01:50:40.144 --> 01:50:43.887]  If he tells his lawyers, I will retire after this.
[01:50:44.788 --> 01:50:46.029]  I'll go into abstention.
[01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:48.311]  Maybe I'll write a book to fund myself.
[01:50:48.351 --> 01:50:49.392]  He needs money, obviously.
[01:50:49.933 --> 01:50:50.874]  But that's it.
[01:50:51.574 --> 01:50:52.355]  They will let him out.
[01:50:52.395 --> 01:50:53.336]  They're scared of him.
[01:50:53.416 --> 01:50:55.598]  And so I want him to be freed.
[01:50:56.835 --> 01:50:57.195]  Are they?
[01:50:57.215 --> 01:50:58.536]  Because I don't know what's going on.
[01:50:58.596 --> 01:50:59.216]  I'm just guessing.
[01:50:59.636 --> 01:51:02.797]  Are they putting pressure on him to make assurances?
[01:51:03.137 --> 01:51:05.337]  Because if he disappears after this, I don't blame him.
[01:51:05.677 --> 01:51:07.858]  He's run a thousand mile marathon, as I said.
[01:51:09.058 --> 01:51:10.059]  I'm just speculating here.
[01:51:10.119 --> 01:51:11.159]  Is any of that going on?
[01:51:11.239 --> 01:51:12.259]  I mean, are they threatening him?
[01:51:12.579 --> 01:51:13.940]  Are they threatening new charges?
[01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:18.321]  I mean, you know, because these are really satanic opportunists.
[01:51:18.701 --> 01:51:24.063]  The fact that they're talking about releasing him tells me they're maybe scared of something else he's got somewhere else.
[01:51:24.143 --> 01:51:25.363]  And I'm purely speculating here.
[01:51:27.631 --> 01:51:29.753]  Well, I think you just have to look at the extradition.
[01:51:30.193 --> 01:51:31.914]  The extradition is continuing on.
[01:51:32.555 --> 01:51:33.876]  The process is continuing on.
[01:51:33.916 --> 01:51:44.484]  Just today, the US Embassy in the UK offered up these so-called assurances to the UK courts.
[01:51:44.504 --> 01:51:48.707]  Assurances that Julian wouldn't receive the death penalty if he's extradited.
[01:51:49.707 --> 01:52:07.899]  And this other sort of weird and wacky assurance that he can argue that he is entitled to First Amendment rights if he's extradited because that was one of the points that the UK judges brought up in this appeal.
[01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:13.603]  So maybe Biden's only claiming he may drop charges so there's not political pressure so he can burn him.
[01:52:13.623 --> 01:52:14.524]  Maybe it's a feint.
[01:52:16.860 --> 01:52:31.921]  Yeah, I don't really know, but I think the pressure on Julian is the extradition, is the continuing extradition process and the continued treatment in this maximum security prison.
[01:52:32.842 --> 01:52:40.364]  You know, the status quo really is in favor of those who are chasing Julian.
[01:52:40.744 --> 01:52:44.145]  You know, the UK is washing this attack on the First Amendment.
[01:52:44.165 --> 01:52:48.446]  They're washing this on... Sure, it's all very embarrassing.
[01:52:48.506 --> 01:52:49.886]  I don't mean to interrupt you for the time we have left.
[01:52:50.166 --> 01:52:51.507]  I've got a lot of questions coming in.
[01:52:51.527 --> 01:52:52.927]  The same question's been asked like five times.
[01:52:53.287 --> 01:52:57.248]  Chase Geyser asked the question, who's been running WikiLeaks since Julian has been gone?
[01:52:57.308 --> 01:53:00.749]  Is it still a reliable source of information or has it been compromised?
[01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:07.612]  Well, Kristen Harrison is the Editor-in-Chief of WikiLeaks, and I know him personally.
[01:53:09.233 --> 01:53:11.694]  WikiLeaks has been able to stay online.
[01:53:11.714 --> 01:53:20.218]  The whole archive, even though it goes offline sometimes, coming under attacks and different things like that, the archive has managed to stay up and running.
[01:53:20.658 --> 01:53:28.201]  Obviously, they're really focused on this fight to free Julian, and so you haven't seen the same amount of news.
[01:53:28.221 --> 01:53:31.323]  I understand, so they tied him down with the attack.
[01:53:32.403 --> 01:53:36.606]  Overall then, what do you think your brother will do if he is released?
[01:53:39.428 --> 01:53:44.311]  Well, I mean, I think hopefully he gets to spend some time with his kids.
[01:53:44.351 --> 01:53:46.092]  He's got two small children.
[01:53:47.193 --> 01:53:52.156]  My nephews, Gabriel and Max, they've only known him inside that prison.
[01:53:52.256 --> 01:53:54.298]  They call it a daddy's house.
[01:53:55.338 --> 01:53:58.501]  They go to see him once a week, so hopefully he can come out and
[01:53:59.622 --> 01:54:02.986]  You know, spend some time with his kids, rest and recuperate.
[01:54:03.927 --> 01:54:11.957]  You know, the doctors I've spoken to who've seen him said that he can get better, but he will need time to rest.
[01:54:12.037 --> 01:54:14.540]  I'm not saying he should do this, but I think he's done enough.
[01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:17.644]  If he signals that he'll just write a book...
[01:54:18.649 --> 01:54:19.450]  To fund himself.
[01:54:19.630 --> 01:54:20.450]  I think they'll let him out.
[01:54:20.731 --> 01:54:21.912]  I'm not trying to get him to sell out.
[01:54:21.992 --> 01:54:22.732]  It's not a sellout.
[01:54:23.072 --> 01:54:23.653]  He's done enough.
[01:54:23.713 --> 01:54:27.796]  I think if he signals that if he comes out as a cause celeb, they're going to kill him in prison.
[01:54:28.316 --> 01:54:29.577]  And so I want to save your brother.
[01:54:29.617 --> 01:54:35.102]  So I, when you talk to your brother, you tell him, and maybe my advice, he's smarter than I am, probably.
[01:54:35.802 --> 01:54:36.883]  I think he's done his job.
[01:54:37.583 --> 01:54:38.764]  And so I think he's done enough.
[01:54:38.844 --> 01:54:43.808]  I think if he signals that he will basically just write a book and that's it, I think they'll let him go.
[01:54:43.868 --> 01:54:44.649]  If not, they're going to kill him.
[01:54:46.519 --> 01:54:48.219]  Yeah, I hope you're right, Alex.
[01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:49.200]  I hope you're right.
[01:54:49.220 --> 01:54:50.540]  I hope that is the case.
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:54.121]  Do you think you can advise him then to just signal to them?
[01:54:54.181 --> 01:54:55.121]  Because they're scared of him.
[01:54:55.982 --> 01:55:00.443]  Yeah, I mean, I'll communicate that to him.
[01:55:00.483 --> 01:55:08.885]  But I think, you know, if any of us were in Julian's position, and someone offered us the key to their prison cell, I'm sure they would take it.
[01:55:08.945 --> 01:55:11.046]  So, you know, I'm not
[01:55:12.126 --> 01:55:16.390]  I think Julian would definitely take an offer like that if it was on the table.
[01:55:16.611 --> 01:55:17.551]  Huge, huge.
[01:55:17.932 --> 01:55:21.655]  I've got another question, and I'm not mad at the people on X, but a lot of the questions are stupid.
[01:55:22.256 --> 01:55:26.720]  I mean, like there's thousands of questions, and like ten of them, I'm a little frustrated.
[01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:30.003]  Rob Dew, one of our crew, I'm not trying to give our crew's questions, but they're the best questions.
[01:55:30.424 --> 01:55:36.870]  Rob Dew, our news director, says, is there anything WikiLeaks has been holding on to, like a dead man switch in case Julian is assassinated?
[01:55:39.477 --> 01:55:41.698]  Well, no, not that I know of, no.
[01:55:42.598 --> 01:55:51.020]  I think there was some, you know, back in the day there was some tweets about Deadman Switches and things like that, but I think that that time has really passed now.
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:58.422]  You know, I don't think they've got anything, I don't think they're sitting on anything, I don't think they're able to really look at things, verify things.
[01:55:58.442 --> 01:56:01.363]  I mean, Julian was the head of Wikileaks and really without him,
[01:56:02.490 --> 01:56:04.611]  It's not able to really function.
[01:56:04.831 --> 01:56:13.013]  And that was the purpose of his prosecution, was to take him out and to set this example to everyone that if you do this sort of thing, you won't have any rights.
[01:56:13.393 --> 01:56:19.255]  We'll be able to come into whatever country we want to, snatch you up, put you in a jail for as long as we want.
[01:56:20.175 --> 01:56:25.057]  It's about terrorizing journalists and the fact that more journalists don't rally to his cause.
[01:56:25.877 --> 01:56:26.637]  It's a litmus test.
[01:56:26.677 --> 01:56:28.818]  If you don't support Julian Assange, you're not a journalist.
[01:56:29.229 --> 01:56:29.809]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:56:30.249 --> 01:56:31.950]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.970]  It's like an exposure.
[01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:38.472]  It really shows who's a journalist and who's not by those who are supporting Julian Assange.
[01:56:39.112 --> 01:56:42.553]  Well, I don't want to sound like a wimp here saying your brother should hang up his hat.
[01:56:43.014 --> 01:56:45.054]  It's just that they've almost killed him, as you know.
[01:56:45.334 --> 01:56:45.994]  I've seen the news.
[01:56:46.035 --> 01:56:47.035]  He's in bad shape, right?
[01:56:47.075 --> 01:56:49.776]  I mean, I think he's a hero.
[01:56:50.116 --> 01:56:51.036]  We can save him.
[01:56:51.056 --> 01:56:52.637]  I think that's what matters now.
[01:56:52.717 --> 01:56:53.377]  He's done his job.
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:58.003]  Yeah, I'm with you Alex.
[01:56:58.043 --> 01:57:00.506]  We've been fighting this battle for a very long time.
[01:57:00.526 --> 01:57:03.850]  We're all very tired and we're all ready to
[01:57:05.023 --> 01:57:15.286]  Yeah, it'd be so good just to have Julian back with his family, recuperating and just have a sort of normal, you know, a semi-normal conversation with my family.
[01:57:15.747 --> 01:57:27.470]  All we ever talk about now is how we're strategising, what can we do next, how can we affect more political change or who are we engaging with and doing all that sort of stuff.
[01:57:27.530 --> 01:57:28.671]  It's taken over our lives.
[01:57:29.451 --> 01:57:31.854]  Alright, well Gabriel Shipton, I know you gotta go.
[01:57:31.874 --> 01:57:34.859]  We've got a two minute break, five more minutes, closing comments from you.
[01:57:35.239 --> 01:57:36.040]  Come back soon.

[01:57:38.183 --> 01:57:41.968]  I've been persecuted by the same folks, not the same level, but I have extreme empathy.
[01:57:42.209 --> 01:57:43.470]  We are all Julian Assange.
[01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:45.073]  Stay there, closing comments.
[01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:49.602]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is back.

[01:58:56.969 --> 01:59:02.871]  I've got a stack right here that I printed of study after study going over all the amazing benefits of nascent iodine.

[02:00:10.216 --> 02:00:13.997]  Brother of Julian Assange, Gabriel Shipton is our guest.
[02:00:14.777 --> 02:00:17.518]  We've got five minutes left before a ton of other news I haven't hit coming up.
[02:00:18.556 --> 02:00:19.437]  And a special guest.
[02:00:20.217 --> 02:00:22.639]  You've got the floor, sir, for any other key points you want to make.
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:24.901]  You've not asked for support financially.
[02:00:24.921 --> 02:00:25.822]  I don't know if we can do that.
[02:00:25.862 --> 02:00:26.842]  How do we support WikiLeaks?
[02:00:27.243 --> 02:00:28.123]  What else can we do?
[02:00:28.984 --> 02:00:29.765]  Last five minutes, sir.
[02:00:32.577 --> 02:00:41.286]  Well, yeah, as I said, the most important thing and the action that we're putting out at the moment is supporting this resolution, House Resolution 934.
[02:00:41.707 --> 02:00:46.512]  You can go to the website assangecampaign.org.
[02:00:47.012 --> 02:00:51.998]  That's assangecampaign.org and there's a really easy to use email tool.
[02:00:52.718 --> 02:00:55.740]  It'll take you two minutes to email your representative.
[02:00:56.461 --> 02:01:06.188]  So yeah, I would ask everybody to go on to AssangeCampaign.org and just take two minutes, pop in your email and send an email off to your representative.
[02:01:06.948 --> 02:01:10.371]  It's very, very quick and very easy and does
[02:01:11.171 --> 02:01:13.053]  Uh, actually make a difference in these offices.
[02:01:13.073 --> 02:01:16.855]  They're always adding up, you know, the different issues that they're getting attention to.
[02:01:16.895 --> 02:01:26.683]  And when we're lobbying here in Washington, we see the results of the constituents actually emailing.
[02:01:26.703 --> 02:01:27.904]  So yeah, AssangeCampaign.org.
[02:01:28.664 --> 02:01:32.227]  We're always posting up-to-date good information and more actions that you can be a part of.
[02:01:48.376 --> 02:01:49.617]  I think soon.
[02:01:49.697 --> 02:01:50.817]  We're very close now.
[02:01:51.118 --> 02:02:01.144]  We're sort of at this, I feel like we're at this zone now where every action that is taken really, really counts.
[02:02:01.644 --> 02:02:06.447]  And we can sort of see a light at the end of the tunnel.
[02:02:06.547 --> 02:02:09.088]  So all your support is very much appreciated.
[02:02:16.124 --> 02:02:19.105]  Gabriel Shempton's Skype has failed.
[02:02:19.926 --> 02:02:20.686]  I think it's back now.
[02:02:21.126 --> 02:02:21.707]  Gabriel, continue.
[02:02:21.727 --> 02:02:23.167]  You're saying we're at the line at the end of the tunnel?
[02:02:25.648 --> 02:02:25.988]  Yeah.
[02:02:26.029 --> 02:02:31.591]  Yeah, so all the actions that happen now really, really count more than they ever have.
[02:02:31.631 --> 02:02:35.493]  And it's really important now that all the advocates really come out in support of
[02:02:37.255 --> 02:03:00.431]  At this critical time, when there's a sort of shifting sense in sitting with the Biden, with them coming out saying we're considering it, it's really important for the advocates now to really raise their voices and to take any kind of action, particularly supporting this House Resolution 934, but also sharing good information with
[02:03:01.051 --> 02:03:02.032]  I absolutely agree with you.
[02:03:02.152 --> 02:03:03.172]  Overall, I think that
[02:03:17.256 --> 02:03:24.062]  Elon Musk has said some things about your brother, and I really think everybody needs to understand that we're all being targeted by the same system.
[02:03:24.102 --> 02:03:29.867]  We need a counterbalance to these out-of-control intelligence agencies, and we're here right now.
[02:03:30.447 --> 02:03:35.772]  What's the last thing, unless it's something you can't talk about, the last time you talked to your brother Julian Assange, what did he say?
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:52.667]  We try and have a laugh when I go to the prison, really, and talk about gossip and who I've met, his old friends, and different things like that.
[02:03:54.788 --> 02:04:03.053]  It's mundane, it's pretty boring stuff, but we always have a laugh about our dad.
[02:04:03.093 --> 02:04:05.294]  Sure, but he's kind of living through you, then.
[02:04:05.314 --> 02:04:07.035]  He's reaching out to the wider world through you.
[02:04:10.117 --> 02:04:11.258]  Yeah, we're his lifeline.
[02:04:11.299 --> 02:04:16.785]  His family, his contact with the outside world, we're his lifeline to the outside world.
[02:04:16.805 --> 02:04:26.998]  We keep him connected to what's going on around the world, the different actions, and that feeds his fire to keep going inside, his hearing about all those actions that are happening around the world.
[02:04:30.096 --> 02:04:31.376]  He's a real hero for humanity.
[02:04:31.396 --> 02:04:31.877]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:59.127 --> 02:05:02.330]  So what I really want to ask you to do is pray for myself and the crew and my family.
[02:05:02.690 --> 02:05:03.431]  That's number one.
[02:05:03.491 --> 02:05:04.212]  I want that.
[02:05:04.312 --> 02:05:04.712]  I need that.
[02:05:05.092 --> 02:05:06.133]  It's your prayer that's doing it.
[02:05:06.434 --> 02:05:07.314]  That's why this surfaced.
[02:05:07.334 --> 02:05:08.195]  That's why this happened.
[02:05:08.215 --> 02:05:09.677]  I need the prayer.
[02:05:10.678 --> 02:05:17.183]  That I need you to take the articles, the videos, the posts we make at Real Alex Jones, recopy them, share them, post them yourself, do whatever.
[02:05:17.223 --> 02:05:18.204]  Just get it out there.
[02:05:19.065 --> 02:05:19.686]  And I need you
[02:05:20.939 --> 02:05:25.042]  To go to InfoWarsTore.com and I need you to get great products you already need.

[02:05:57.903 --> 02:06:03.325]  We'll be right back.
[02:06:03.365 --> 02:06:07.266]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:07.306 --> 02:06:08.466]  Journalist Matt Baker.
[02:06:17.179 --> 02:06:24.967]  Fitzsandio got a great interview with a whistleblower at the airport on the massive illegal alien invasion taking place now.
[02:06:25.407 --> 02:06:31.954]  The DSA groups you and your family, but the illegals, in many cases with no ID, including small children, go straight through.
[02:06:32.374 --> 02:06:33.816]  Here's part of the viral interview.
[02:06:33.916 --> 02:06:36.859]  We'll take a look at what's happening on a wider scale straight ahead.
[02:06:38.294 --> 02:06:50.270]  Alright, Matt Baker here reporting live from San Diego at the airport and we were surprised that this gentleman right here, we were asking him where we might find some of the migrants and he was just as pissed off and frustrated about it as we are.
[02:06:50.310 --> 02:06:51.231]  Tell us a little bit about it.
[02:06:51.852 --> 02:06:53.174]  Well, the problem is that
[02:06:54.395 --> 02:06:58.679]  They get released from the, uh, when they've been locked up.
[02:06:58.959 --> 02:07:03.903]  They just cross the border, uh, process in a couple of days and then they get released.
[02:07:04.624 --> 02:07:12.491]  So when they come to the airport, then most of them, they don't have tickets, they don't have money, they don't have, uh, not even a place to go.
[02:07:13.211 --> 02:07:14.813]  And we have a problem that
[02:07:15.253 --> 02:07:17.815]  They don't have a credit card to pay for the fare.
[02:07:19.716 --> 02:07:24.439]  And the breaking part, I mean the breaking heart is that you see children, they're hungry.
[02:07:26.621 --> 02:07:29.503]  So they create a lot of problems for our operation.
[02:07:29.643 --> 02:07:34.566]  And they leave trash all over the place and they fall asleep all over the place.
[02:07:35.186 --> 02:07:41.791]  And the bathrooms, I've seen guys taking a shower, I mean not a shower, washing their feet in the sink.
[02:07:42.571 --> 02:07:45.213]  And it's really a big problem.
[02:07:45.253 --> 02:07:49.377]  Is it getting worse and do you see any ending in sight?
[02:07:50.258 --> 02:07:51.759]  Not in sight.
[02:07:51.799 --> 02:07:53.020]  They just keep on coming.
[02:07:53.741 --> 02:08:08.494]  There is a lot of organization that they bring in 10, 20 immigrants at a time and they bring in on the bus and they help them with everything they need in order to get across.
[02:08:09.215 --> 02:08:15.219]  Do you think that it was better during the Trump years or now that Biden's in?
[02:08:15.239 --> 02:08:16.380]  Do you think it's got worse?
[02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:18.201]  You don't have to answer that question if you don't want to.
[02:08:18.401 --> 02:08:18.942]  No, I do.
[02:08:19.042 --> 02:08:19.302]  I do.
[02:08:19.402 --> 02:08:27.467]  I think Trump had more control over the border and it's terrible what this administration is doing.
[02:08:28.688 --> 02:08:34.552]  Just take the immigrants, let him go through, process the immigrants in a couple of days.
[02:08:35.113 --> 02:08:37.214]  They come to my desk trying to get a ticket.
[02:08:38.795 --> 02:08:45.178]  And I see the form, and they give them an appointment, a court date for two years later, one year later.
[02:08:45.638 --> 02:08:48.419]  So these people, they're never going to show up for their appointment.
[02:08:48.799 --> 02:08:53.581]  So it's not a racist thing, it's just simply, you've got to come in legally and do things the right way.
[02:08:53.601 --> 02:08:59.363]  We can't just have an open situation and literally be encouraged an invasion of our country, right?
[02:08:59.483 --> 02:09:01.424]  It's exactly what it is, an invasion.
[02:09:01.664 --> 02:09:02.044]  Thank you very much.
[02:09:02.064 --> 02:09:03.185]  I really appreciate your time.
[02:09:03.245 --> 02:09:05.187]  I was very surprised that you were able to talk with us.
[02:09:05.507 --> 02:09:06.608]  I really appreciate that.
[02:09:06.668 --> 02:09:07.049]  Thank you.
[02:09:07.069 --> 02:09:07.869]  So you heard it here.
[02:09:08.130 --> 02:09:09.351]  You heard it from the man himself.
[02:09:09.711 --> 02:09:10.772]  Right here in San Diego.
[02:09:11.152 --> 02:09:11.813]  It's a problem.
[02:09:13.294 --> 02:09:16.877]  And people are willing to lose their jobs at the airports to tell the truth.
[02:09:17.257 --> 02:09:18.058]  We have all the footage.
[02:09:18.078 --> 02:09:19.179]  I can show hours of it.
[02:09:19.639 --> 02:09:20.640]  Thousands of illegals.
[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:22.001]  Hundreds of illegals at the airport.
[02:09:22.542 --> 02:09:23.363]  Waved on through.
[02:09:23.423 --> 02:09:24.564]  Little kids by themselves.
[02:09:24.744 --> 02:09:25.945]  Handed off to random people.
[02:09:26.505 --> 02:09:28.267]  This is a lawless criminal government.
[02:09:30.063 --> 02:09:31.904]  Don't worry, you're going to get grubbed at the TSA.
[02:09:31.924 --> 02:09:35.506]  So Matt Baker is a great talk show host and a good friend of mine and he was here with us.
[02:09:35.526 --> 02:09:39.788]  He was talking about a lot of issues and this ties into everything we already know that's going on.
[02:09:41.530 --> 02:09:43.792]  And it just illustrates the war on this country.
[02:09:45.053 --> 02:09:47.095]  All these blue cities saying illegals can vote.
[02:09:47.655 --> 02:09:48.936]  All these U.N.
[02:09:49.036 --> 02:09:52.359]  centers set up in Chicago and New York and L.A.
[02:09:52.419 --> 02:09:52.979]  and everywhere.
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:54.501]  And all these tent cities.
[02:09:55.121 --> 02:09:57.343]  I mean, this is the attempted collapse of our country.
[02:09:57.883 --> 02:10:00.606]  The Democrats sign them up for welfare and then skim off the top.
[02:10:01.006 --> 02:10:02.607]  Matt Baker, so much to talk about.
[02:10:02.627 --> 02:10:03.448]  Great to have you on with us.
[02:10:05.189 --> 02:10:06.270]  How's it going, Alex?
[02:10:06.370 --> 02:10:07.571]  Good to see you again, man.
[02:10:07.912 --> 02:10:09.633]  Happy 30 years in the game, man.
[02:10:10.233 --> 02:10:11.554]  We couldn't have done it without you here.
[02:10:12.996 --> 02:10:17.119]  So glad that you're not with Julian Assange there, rotting away.
[02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:18.681]  That's where they like to put us all.
[02:10:18.761 --> 02:10:26.508]  So talk about the border in San Diego and California and this latest interview we just saw and where you see all this going.
[02:10:26.528 --> 02:10:28.270]  It's just really woken up the American people.
[02:10:29.881 --> 02:10:33.064]  Well, it's part of a bigger, bigger operation, actually.
[02:10:33.104 --> 02:10:37.007]  I mean, the whole thing is the American people are the enemy, okay?
[02:10:37.027 --> 02:10:39.469]  If you haven't realized that, then you're not paying attention.
[02:10:39.669 --> 02:10:48.016]  I mean, I was going down there with one of my friends, Luke Slywaker, and he's working in conjunction with Audra Morgan, and it'll be produced by Robert Johnson.
[02:10:48.437 --> 02:10:56.964]  They have an entire documentary coming out soon called The Border Machine, and it breaks down the entire operation and the different parts of it, the NGOs,
[02:10:57.677 --> 02:11:07.629]  The religious organizations, where they're storing them, the busing companies, the holding facilities, who's moving them, where they're going, who's getting paid.
[02:11:08.851 --> 02:11:09.592]  In San Diego,
[02:11:10.638 --> 02:11:17.380]  We're actually now just spending $19.6 million on what is basically an immigrant welcome center.
[02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:24.041]  So instead of trying to block these people like this man said, this guy, I don't want to say, like, someone says, oh, he looks like a random guy.
[02:11:24.061 --> 02:11:28.102]  I'm like, if you can't, like, look at that video, I'm not going to dox the guy.
[02:11:28.502 --> 02:11:32.423]  But I can believe he actually came out and was willing to tell us all this stuff.
[02:11:32.543 --> 02:11:34.704]  Like, he is on the clock right there, okay?
[02:11:34.744 --> 02:11:36.324]  This guy works in the airport.
[02:11:36.544 --> 02:11:38.705]  But we already have the footage everywhere of it happening.
[02:11:38.725 --> 02:11:39.725]  It's admitted they're doing it.
[02:11:40.365 --> 02:11:41.787]  He's just an airport worker commenting.
[02:11:42.869 --> 02:11:44.911]  Yeah, I just couldn't believe that he was actually willing.
[02:11:44.931 --> 02:11:46.714]  I'm like, you wouldn't say this on camera, would you?
[02:11:46.754 --> 02:11:47.956]  He's like, yeah, I would actually.
[02:11:47.976 --> 02:11:50.960]  And I don't know if he clocked in or clocked out, but he went in the office.
[02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:53.964]  Well, that's the good news is people are pissed and they don't care now.
[02:11:55.439 --> 02:11:58.562]  Yeah, and so he's telling us that they're in there like washing their feet.
[02:11:58.622 --> 02:12:03.706]  And I think he wanted to say taking a dump in there, but I don't think he had the heart to say it.
[02:12:03.766 --> 02:12:10.272]  But yeah, you go down there and basically they have all these local hotels that they're using to hold these guys in.
[02:12:10.832 --> 02:12:17.337]  And we went by, I went by with my buddy, Luke, and we're looking over the fence and these security guards, they look like federales.
[02:12:17.357 --> 02:12:18.357]  They are jacked up.
[02:12:18.397 --> 02:12:20.339]  They have guns coming out of the nines.
[02:12:20.379 --> 02:12:21.799]  They're wearing bulletproof vests.
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:26.923]  I mean, I just watched the movie Civil War and it literally looks like an enemy garrison town.
[02:12:27.223 --> 02:12:28.604]  They have this tent set up.
[02:12:28.624 --> 02:12:29.625]  They're blocking it off.
[02:12:29.665 --> 02:12:32.407]  They have military guards outside with guns.
[02:12:32.687 --> 02:12:39.771]  And we're up there and we're just taking a little look before you even put the camera out there, like pointing at us and like walking over, like getting all tough and trying to blow up on us.
[02:12:40.792 --> 02:12:55.023]  It's so weird to feel that vibe like I'm just here as an American citizen and these guys are literally like an enemy invading army with guns, with tents, with posted up, with munitions, and they've got their food storage, and they've got their money, and their operation.
[02:12:55.164 --> 02:13:00.568]  And federal judges have ruled citizens can't have guns, the same Obama judge, but the illegals can.
[02:13:02.145 --> 02:13:02.986]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:03.246 --> 02:13:05.269]  And when it comes down to, you know, here we go.
[02:13:05.369 --> 02:13:07.311]  I just wanted to say this for Assange.
[02:13:07.891 --> 02:13:17.382]  No man escapes when freedom fails, and good men rot in filthy jails, and those who cried, appease, appease, are hung by those they tried to please.
[02:13:17.662 --> 02:13:19.324]  And that is what is happening in America.
[02:13:19.524 --> 02:13:20.586]  When I was on the... No, you're right.
[02:13:20.666 --> 02:13:23.369]  Total appeasement to China, the globalists, everybody.
[02:13:24.984 --> 02:13:34.181]  Yeah, when I was on the X Space with you, the point I was making is that in Yuri Bezmenov's three stages of ideological subversion,
[02:13:34.873 --> 02:13:36.995]  You have the demoralization.
[02:13:37.035 --> 02:13:38.536]  That's the transgender movement.
[02:13:38.576 --> 02:13:41.598]  That's the, you know, the cutting off of your children's penises.
[02:13:41.919 --> 02:13:43.560]  And then you have the destabilization.
[02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:44.901]  That was COVID.
[02:13:44.981 --> 02:13:46.082]  That was BLM.
[02:13:46.142 --> 02:13:48.664]  That was J6 and stealing elections.
[02:13:49.004 --> 02:13:55.129]  And I really feel, unfortunately, unless we wake ourselves up and really, really get out of our comfort zone,
[02:13:55.763 --> 02:14:02.566]  We are in the normalization phase, where it's just becoming something we just sit around and talk about, like, oh, can you believe they stole all our freedoms?
[02:14:02.706 --> 02:14:04.907]  Oh, can you believe Julian Assange is running in jail?
[02:14:05.007 --> 02:14:07.129]  Oh, can you believe Alex Jones got all his money stolen?
[02:14:07.409 --> 02:14:14.212]  Oh, can you believe the President of the United States is in jail and being on trial every single day of his life?
[02:14:14.232 --> 02:14:16.293]  I mean, what is it going to take?
[02:14:16.969 --> 02:14:18.210]  We are under attack.
[02:14:18.530 --> 02:14:19.850]  This is not normal.
[02:14:20.211 --> 02:14:23.952]  America is under attack on every single frontier.
[02:14:24.392 --> 02:14:29.715]  They are pulling every leg, every post, every pillar out of the structure that is our nation.
[02:14:30.195 --> 02:14:40.540]  If we don't do something about it soon, it's going to be completely over, collapsed into a pile of rubble on the ground, and there will be no putting Humpty Dumpty back together again, my friends.
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:41.280]  No, that's right.
[02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:43.021]  The takedown is happening now.
[02:14:44.099 --> 02:14:46.761]  And I just don't think the general public still realizes this is it.
[02:14:46.801 --> 02:14:47.622]  This is the takeover.
[02:14:49.383 --> 02:14:49.603]  Yeah.
[02:14:49.924 --> 02:14:50.384]  We're in it.
[02:14:50.584 --> 02:14:52.426]  And it's just become so normal.
[02:14:52.726 --> 02:14:57.470]  What they did, I really feel like what they did with COVID was they put everybody, it was like a timeout.
[02:14:57.530 --> 02:15:00.032]  Like, you go in your room, you sit there, you can't do anything.
[02:15:00.052 --> 02:15:02.834]  And then when we got let out of our room, we're like, oh, we're back.
[02:15:03.234 --> 02:15:05.816]  When really, when we got let out, we lost an election.
[02:15:05.856 --> 02:15:07.077]  We have no borders.
[02:15:07.117 --> 02:15:08.058]  We have no country.
[02:15:08.098 --> 02:15:10.300]  We've all been attacked by a bioweapon.
[02:15:11.261 --> 02:15:12.862]  We don't have the First Amendment anymore.
[02:15:12.902 --> 02:15:14.443]  We don't have the Fourth Amendment anymore.
[02:15:14.463 --> 02:15:17.325]  They're taking away our right to privacy.
[02:15:17.785 --> 02:15:21.048]  This 702 thing, the Greg Rees report, I mean...
[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:24.241]  They're just completely getting rid of all checks and balances.
[02:15:24.621 --> 02:15:29.922]  And then they go, Oh, well, we need to worry about terrorists coming in when meanwhile, they just got their borders completely wide open.
[02:15:29.962 --> 02:15:34.964]  And they let any single person come in who says, Oh, I'm scared of my country.
[02:15:35.184 --> 02:15:36.144]  I'm scared of my country.
[02:15:36.204 --> 02:15:37.365]  They don't have to have a reason.
[02:15:37.725 --> 02:15:44.487]  It's just like, like, you know, the dog you have, you get on the plane, they're not allowed to ask you why you have your security dog or whatever they call it.
[02:15:44.747 --> 02:15:46.089]  Well, let's expand on that.
[02:15:46.389 --> 02:15:52.216]  And they give us all these faux rights like a security animal, but not all of our real rights, which we don't, we aren't given.
[02:15:52.236 --> 02:15:52.797]  We take them.
[02:15:54.019 --> 02:15:55.000]  There is a big awakening.
[02:15:55.060 --> 02:15:56.822]  I see it on the street, but is it enough?
[02:15:57.563 --> 02:15:59.005]  And how do you expect this to go?
[02:15:59.125 --> 02:16:03.711]  And don't the people going along with the globalist takeover realize, Matt Baker, they're destroying their own future?
[02:16:05.481 --> 02:16:07.343]  Well, I've said it before and I'll say it again.
[02:16:07.383 --> 02:16:13.089]  The four feet of marble that hold you above high in this chamber will not help you from the fate of humanity which you are unleashing.
[02:16:13.510 --> 02:16:18.755]  They just don't seem to realize that the very ether that they swim in is like you were saying earlier.
[02:16:18.775 --> 02:16:20.918]  They didn't just take a piss in the pool.
[02:16:20.938 --> 02:16:21.959]  They didn't just take a dump.
[02:16:21.979 --> 02:16:23.901]  They've literally just piped sewage in.
[02:16:24.301 --> 02:16:29.067]  To where the NGOs and all these people, they make living off the homeless people.
[02:16:29.107 --> 02:16:30.489]  It's become the new food.
[02:16:30.549 --> 02:16:37.158]  It's like they're bottom feeders in the literal sense, where the new food is these hungry masses of people on the streets.
[02:16:37.178 --> 02:16:40.902]  That's right, they use our altruism and our charity as a way to topple us.
[02:16:41.203 --> 02:16:42.024]  That's Cloward and Piven.
[02:16:43.706 --> 02:16:45.987]  Yeah, it's become the new ecosystem.
[02:16:46.027 --> 02:16:49.767]  The new ecosystem is fraud and backstabbing and eating.
[02:16:50.248 --> 02:17:03.631]  And you go to these places in San Francisco and it's like, oh, it's cost $120,000 a year per homeless person when they basically get a couple of, you know, top ramens and a cot every once in a while and maybe a little bit of medical care.
[02:17:03.991 --> 02:17:04.711]  The total cost
[02:17:05.151 --> 02:17:07.113]  It couldn't possibly be more than $20,000.
[02:17:07.173 --> 02:17:08.414]  Where does the $100,000 go?
[02:17:08.834 --> 02:17:13.058]  It goes to all these corrupt politicians that keep calling, oh, we care so much about them.
[02:17:13.318 --> 02:17:18.762]  And they're grifting and grifting, $100,000 per person, so they don't want that problem to end.
[02:17:19.162 --> 02:17:20.303]  They want to keep it going.
[02:17:20.544 --> 02:17:21.564]  This is their new farm.
[02:17:21.604 --> 02:17:23.026]  This is their new plantation.
[02:17:23.306 --> 02:17:24.327]  This is what we're on.
[02:17:24.587 --> 02:17:29.771]  This is the Democrats doing the same old playbook, just profiting off of the demise and the pathetic
[02:17:31.252 --> 02:17:32.492]  Destruction of people.
[02:17:32.512 --> 02:17:33.293]  Let me ask you this.
[02:17:33.653 --> 02:17:39.094]  Mark Zuckerberg, and I've got video of it aired yet, it was in a plane in Hawaii I shot, and on the road.
[02:17:39.894 --> 02:17:44.716]  He's got, for three years, a giant underground base with 20-30 dump trucks a day.
[02:17:45.096 --> 02:17:47.197]  When I flew over there were like eight dump trucks driving off.
[02:17:47.537 --> 02:17:52.838]  He's building some like 10-story, I've told people that work there, deep bunker, thinking he'll be saving that.
[02:17:52.898 --> 02:17:55.479]  So they rob the whole world, they screw everyone,
[02:17:56.570 --> 02:17:59.591]  So there's a collapse, then they go live in bunkers?
[02:17:59.631 --> 02:18:00.992]  That's not a very smart elite.
[02:18:01.392 --> 02:18:02.772]  But I guess they can't help themselves.
[02:18:03.172 --> 02:18:06.253]  They think they'll be smart in a bunker when everything collapses?
[02:18:06.574 --> 02:18:08.034]  Everyone's going to go to that bunker.
[02:18:09.254 --> 02:18:09.975]  They're going to eat them.
[02:18:09.995 --> 02:18:10.135]  Yeah.
[02:18:12.556 --> 02:18:13.556]  I'll eat your ass!
[02:18:14.156 --> 02:18:14.656]  Exactly.
[02:18:15.056 --> 02:18:21.959]  By the way, I actually created a Mexican version of you with a buddy of mine through AI called Alejandro Cajones.
[02:18:22.559 --> 02:18:24.960]  And I spelled with a J, so it looks like Cajones.
[02:18:25.495 --> 02:18:28.638]  And so you speak Spanish, but you have a big Mexican mustache.
[02:18:28.998 --> 02:18:29.679]  It's really funny.
[02:18:29.699 --> 02:18:31.220]  I haven't seen that.
[02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:33.002]  How do we find Alexander Cajones?
[02:18:34.308 --> 02:18:35.469]  Yeah, Alexander Cajones.
[02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:37.131]  It might be on my page there.
[02:18:37.171 --> 02:18:39.693]  It's the I'll Eat Your Ass rant is the first one I did.
[02:18:39.733 --> 02:18:54.326]  I really wanted to do it where we could set up your show in Spanish like every day so that we could literally wake up our brothers south of the border and our fellow, you know, Americans that happen to speak Spanish because the Spanish people are actually not bad people.
[02:18:54.386 --> 02:18:56.928]  They could be great allies if they weren't turned against us.
[02:18:58.010 --> 02:18:59.090]  Oh, I totally agree.
[02:18:59.550 --> 02:19:01.831]  In fact, they've been rejecting it probably more than any other group.
[02:19:01.871 --> 02:19:05.072]  So big picture, what do you expect happens in the next 200 days?
[02:19:05.612 --> 02:19:11.694]  It's like 200 days now with Biden, the show trial where Trump has to stay in New York and can't campaign.
[02:19:12.034 --> 02:19:14.955]  And he's charged with election meddling while the election meddle.
[02:19:15.035 --> 02:19:16.075]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:19:17.695 --> 02:19:20.356]  Yeah, they literally project every single thing they do.
[02:19:20.476 --> 02:19:24.557]  I mean, how can we live in a country where you're saying, oh, we want democracy.
[02:19:24.577 --> 02:19:26.578]  So we have to take people off of the ballot.
[02:19:27.054 --> 02:19:29.037]  I mean, wake up, people!
[02:19:29.678 --> 02:19:31.340]  Stop letting this be normal.
[02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:34.023]  Honestly, I think the right has a problem too.
[02:19:34.484 --> 02:19:39.150]  We kind of feed off it too, not myself personally, but a lot of people feed off this degradation.
[02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:42.695]  I can't wait for the next Dylan Mulvaney video to come out so they can post it.
[02:19:43.155 --> 02:19:44.096]  I agree.
[02:19:44.116 --> 02:19:47.098]  So how do we focus on what we're doing instead of the enemy?
[02:20:00.236 --> 02:20:03.199]  Well, we need to stop focusing and read.
[02:20:03.279 --> 02:20:04.761]  I said this last time I was on with you.
[02:20:04.781 --> 02:20:07.644]  It's like the Sodom and Gomorrah.
[02:20:07.744 --> 02:20:12.649]  The whole point of that is when you don't look back at the city of Sodom and Gomorrah, you have to look away.
[02:20:12.989 --> 02:20:16.973]  You can't look and constantly post pictures of Dylan Mulvaney thinking you're saving something.
[02:20:17.233 --> 02:20:21.955]  All you're doing is making that whack job famous and making other losers want to be like him.
[02:20:22.196 --> 02:20:23.496]  And now they have to outdo him.
[02:20:23.656 --> 02:20:26.958]  It's like the satanic rituals at all these festivals, at all these shows.
[02:20:27.298 --> 02:20:35.902]  Because they know, if they put a satanic thing out, the right wing will advertise it for free and then the left wing will buy it just to piss the right wing off.
[02:20:36.342 --> 02:20:37.863]  It's free advertisement.
[02:20:38.223 --> 02:20:41.065]  Donna, you've got to explain to people that follow this the trick.
[02:20:42.867 --> 02:20:43.848]  Yeah, and they love it.
[02:20:43.868 --> 02:20:45.308]  And they're like, oh, I'm a Christian.
[02:20:45.388 --> 02:20:46.209]  I'm standing up for it.
[02:20:46.229 --> 02:20:50.691]  And meanwhile, it's like, I'm just getting inundated with gay imagery all day by so-called Christians.
[02:20:50.931 --> 02:20:54.893]  I wouldn't even know who Dylan Mulvaney was if it wasn't for these people posting him all the time.
[02:20:55.474 --> 02:20:56.454]  Turn your back on them.
[02:20:56.854 --> 02:20:57.435]  Turn away.
[02:20:57.835 --> 02:20:59.216]  Turn towards creating things.
[02:20:59.376 --> 02:21:00.396]  Turn towards truth.
[02:21:00.476 --> 02:21:01.417]  Turn towards honesty.
[02:21:01.657 --> 02:21:06.439]  All the people in the Senate, all the people in the House, you cannot do this to our Constitution.
[02:21:06.679 --> 02:21:09.461]  You are committing treason and you know it!
[02:21:10.748 --> 02:21:14.911]  So what's your predictions for Trump and America on the current trajectory?
[02:21:16.772 --> 02:21:19.074]  Man, you know, honestly, it's a foggy world out there.
[02:21:20.735 --> 02:21:33.243]  Sometimes I gotta say, it's weird to me, because you always say that Trump is fighting the deep state, which is supposed to be the biggest, deepest, darkest agency that overthrows countries, that kills people, that launches biomedical weapons on the world.
[02:21:33.263 --> 02:21:36.125]  I'm not saying Trump's perfect, but he's definitely pissed them off.
[02:21:37.054 --> 02:21:39.616]  I'm just wondering why he's still breathing.
[02:21:39.676 --> 02:21:40.217]  No offense.
[02:21:40.637 --> 02:21:45.121]  If he was really going to dismantle the entire world evil system, why wouldn't they just have him?
[02:21:45.181 --> 02:21:51.447]  That's because they learn when they kill somebody, like JFK or Martin Luther King, it makes them bigger.
[02:21:51.527 --> 02:21:53.089]  They're trying to kill who he is first.
[02:21:54.164 --> 02:21:57.768]  And his biggest sin is he wouldn't take orders from them.
[02:21:58.008 --> 02:21:58.929]  Trump's got big problems.
[02:21:59.229 --> 02:22:01.171]  But he literally wants to run things himself.
[02:22:01.532 --> 02:22:02.833]  They run it by these big committees.
[02:22:02.853 --> 02:22:03.654]  That's why they don't like Trump.
[02:22:04.054 --> 02:22:04.615]  But I agree.
[02:22:04.795 --> 02:22:06.717]  People think Trump is going to save us.
[02:22:06.737 --> 02:22:07.138]  They're wrong.
[02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:10.943]  I mean, I want to be on Team Humanity so badly right now.
[02:22:11.063 --> 02:22:22.315]  I see you getting together with Elon, and I see Joe Rogan, and I see all these people, and I got to try and put in my head to stop being such a purist because, like Owen Schroeder says, you can't be a political purist.
[02:22:22.655 --> 02:22:24.117]  Like, you know, Elon Musk
[02:22:24.964 --> 02:22:28.627]  Is pushing a carbon tax, which is basically the food of a new world order.
[02:22:28.687 --> 02:22:30.629]  Oh no, Elon's pushing driverless cars.
[02:22:30.669 --> 02:22:31.529]  He's doing a bunch of bad.
[02:22:31.950 --> 02:22:36.853]  I just see him moving towards us, opening up some free speech and devastating a lot of stuff.
[02:22:37.094 --> 02:22:38.375]  So I'm like, I agree with that.
[02:22:38.475 --> 02:22:40.016]  I'm not saying I agree with all of it.
[02:22:41.018 --> 02:22:50.669]  So basically what I'm doing and proposing to do and trying to convince myself to do is to forget the small issues and to stay on Team Humanity at least through the election.
[02:22:50.749 --> 02:22:51.790]  No infighting.
[02:22:51.850 --> 02:22:54.413]  Let's stick with anybody who's pushing and helping our thing.
[02:22:54.653 --> 02:22:56.836]  We can deal with those fights later.
[02:22:57.532 --> 02:22:59.133]  We can deal with those fights later.
[02:22:59.413 --> 02:23:02.454]  Right now, we certainly cannot go through another four years of Joe Biden.
[02:23:02.514 --> 02:23:09.218]  If I have to watch that freakazoid crumble and bumble around on the TV, talk about the demoralization phase.
[02:23:09.558 --> 02:23:14.180]  Just seeing him on a world stage is so embarrassing as an American.
[02:23:14.480 --> 02:23:17.302]  It makes you want to crawl into a hole and die.
[02:23:17.322 --> 02:23:19.163]  This guy is pathetic.
[02:23:19.743 --> 02:23:20.243]  Well, that's right.
[02:23:20.263 --> 02:23:22.804]  They're giving us lower expectations with Biden.
[02:23:22.905 --> 02:23:23.625]  That's what he's all about.
[02:23:24.867 --> 02:23:26.868]  Yeah, I'd say it's an interesting thing.
[02:23:26.908 --> 02:23:33.390]  I just watched the movie Civil War last night and it was very strange because they never told you what it was that they were arguing about.
[02:23:33.711 --> 02:23:42.154]  The only thing that really was the moral of the story was someone said to the president, well, don't you still think it was a good idea that you disbanded the FBI?
[02:23:42.694 --> 02:23:49.258]  So I think that's very interesting that we're constantly saying they need to disband these agencies and they're basically threatening the president, you're going to get murdered.
[02:23:49.278 --> 02:23:58.244]  And they're saying, I haven't seen the movie yet, but I heard that it's martial law happened because we got rid of the intelligence agencies and they're saying you get rid of us, we do civil war.
[02:23:59.574 --> 02:24:10.625]  Yeah, and it's kind of food for cutards, too, because the military, it's like the Western alliance you would think would be the Texas and California, which nobody knows why they're together, but for some reason they're together.
[02:24:10.645 --> 02:24:18.852]  But they have all the military, they have all the gunships, all the tanks, everything, and everyone else is just like running around somehow standing up for the president.
[02:24:18.972 --> 02:24:24.618]  I guess maybe that's supposed to be like Trump and his hillbillies fighting against the real Americans.
[02:24:25.552 --> 02:24:26.232]  Spoiler alert!
[02:24:26.472 --> 02:24:35.035]  Turn off the channel right now if you don't want to know this, but it's funny because a black lady does shoot the President in the head at the end of the movie.
[02:24:35.995 --> 02:24:38.236]  Well, they're just trying to train us that martial law is here.
[02:24:39.016 --> 02:24:41.677]  And they don't even want to make it political, just the idea that it's here.
[02:24:41.937 --> 02:24:43.037]  No, screw that movie.
[02:24:43.057 --> 02:24:43.637]  I haven't seen it yet.
[02:24:43.657 --> 02:24:44.557]  I've read the transcript.
[02:24:45.058 --> 02:24:46.338]  Expose the whole stinkin' thing.
[02:24:48.087 --> 02:24:52.572]  Well, yeah, okay, so basically, like I said, they keep it a total mystery of what they're fighting over.
[02:24:52.632 --> 02:24:55.415]  You have no idea what one side is about and what the other side is.
[02:24:55.871 --> 02:25:02.138]  Except for there is one part when one of the hillbilly kind of ish guys, the guy with the shades, is like, what kind of American are you?
[02:25:02.258 --> 02:25:04.300]  He's actually saying North, South or Middle America.
[02:25:04.400 --> 02:25:06.702]  And then the guy, one of the guys says he's Chinese.
[02:25:06.742 --> 02:25:07.623]  He goes, China!
[02:25:07.944 --> 02:25:08.804]  And he shoots the guy.
[02:25:09.105 --> 02:25:10.967]  So I think that's a little bit of a dig on Trump.
[02:25:11.447 --> 02:25:18.054]  But it's interesting because the people who are actually taking out the president seem like the American Americans in a weird way.
[02:25:18.658 --> 02:25:20.543]  So, uh, it's a very confusing movie.
[02:25:20.623 --> 02:25:22.347]  It's cinematically amazing.
[02:25:22.748 --> 02:25:24.072]  The soundtrack is epic.
[02:25:24.272 --> 02:25:26.157]  It actually sounds like some kind of, like, 60s, uh...
[02:25:28.078 --> 02:25:29.079]  I don't know.
[02:25:50.492 --> 02:26:02.124]  Well, yeah, and there's a lot of dehumanization in it, because, like, there'll be these scenes where everything's just going crazy and people are getting dismembered, and there'll be, like, this moment where, like, you're just looking at, like, a daisy fluttering in the wind or something.
[02:26:02.164 --> 02:26:04.226]  It's very, very surreal, very strange.
[02:26:05.027 --> 02:26:06.869]  Overall, I would say it was a decent movie.
[02:26:07.390 --> 02:26:13.336]  Hopefully, it at least gives the politicians a nightmare or two and makes them think to themselves,
[02:26:13.922 --> 02:26:15.824]  What they're doing and what they're destroying.
[02:26:15.844 --> 02:26:19.629]  They're destroying the best, greatest, last hope of humanity.
[02:26:19.889 --> 02:26:23.513]  I mean, we're teetering on the edge of every problem we could ever imagine.
[02:26:23.573 --> 02:26:25.576]  World War III, AI takeover.
[02:26:26.451 --> 02:26:30.053]  Communism, social credit scores, Mark of the Beast.
[02:26:30.154 --> 02:26:31.935]  We do not need weak leaders.
[02:26:31.995 --> 02:26:36.758]  You guys get a freaking spine and do the right thing!
[02:26:36.778 --> 02:26:37.719]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[02:26:38.079 --> 02:26:43.863]  Free, open society creates stability, but powerful corporations like BlackRock don't want it because it gets in the way of their consolidation.
[02:26:44.815 --> 02:26:45.916]  It's like suicide bankers.
[02:26:45.936 --> 02:26:50.760]  There were bankers and stock traders when the towers were collapsing that made record promises.
[02:26:50.780 --> 02:26:52.621]  They stayed at their desk to make the money.
[02:26:53.042 --> 02:26:54.543]  Don't be a suicide trader.
[02:26:54.883 --> 02:26:56.104]  Don't be a suicide banker.
[02:26:56.585 --> 02:26:57.565]  Stop the New World War.
[02:26:59.747 --> 02:27:00.608]  We got to do it, man.
[02:27:00.828 --> 02:27:01.429]  We got to do it.
[02:27:01.489 --> 02:27:05.552]  We need peace on Earth, too, because these drones are getting out of control.
[02:27:05.612 --> 02:27:11.737]  This lavender system that's going on over in Israel and Palestine.
[02:27:12.641 --> 02:27:14.448]  Gregg Reiss, another great Gregg Reiss report.
[02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:16.275]  Lavender they call it.
[02:27:16.396 --> 02:27:16.918]  As the AI
[02:27:17.987 --> 02:27:22.608]  Surveils you and designates you a number on a threat continuum.
[02:27:22.948 --> 02:27:26.589]  And Adam King is, well, all those people were on terrorist watch lists.
[02:27:26.649 --> 02:27:28.869]  It's like, yeah, created by your AI.
[02:27:29.129 --> 02:27:32.370]  You know, we're all on that same terrorist watch list over here, people.
[02:27:32.730 --> 02:27:35.950]  So the minute they go, oh, we're just having drones take everybody out.
[02:27:36.010 --> 02:27:37.390]  It's all been designated by the AI.
[02:27:37.410 --> 02:27:39.131]  And then it gives them plausible deniability.
[02:27:39.191 --> 02:27:45.052]  Well, we blew up the food aid workers because AI said do it.
[02:27:46.232 --> 02:27:46.432]  Yeah.
[02:27:47.065 --> 02:27:49.888]  But meanwhile, there's nothing strategic about what's going on over there.
[02:27:49.908 --> 02:28:02.183]  I mean, when was the last time you've seen someone actually take over, basically bomb a country, completely carpet bomb it, and before the dust even settles, they're moving their earthmovers in, just like, and then their girls are there dancing on their new houses.
[02:28:03.104 --> 02:28:06.029]  And people are talking about buying beachfront property over there.
[02:28:06.069 --> 02:28:06.870]  It's disgusting.
[02:28:06.910 --> 02:28:12.779]  You're talking about the President's 666 son-in-law, which gives me big problems with Trump.
[02:28:12.819 --> 02:28:17.466]  But that's the thing is, the Pentagon admits two-thirds of the Israeli bombs are not smart.
[02:28:18.737 --> 02:28:28.185]  So they're dropping just regular bombs on civilians and then I'm the enemy of Israel telling them you've destroyed... I mean people hate Israel now.
[02:28:28.526 --> 02:28:29.306]  I'm not even part of it.
[02:28:29.687 --> 02:28:31.288]  But I'm your enemy?
[02:28:31.368 --> 02:28:33.110]  No, you're your own worst enemy.
[02:28:34.847 --> 02:28:40.032]  Yeah, I mean, they've gotten caught up in mass formation psychosis.
[02:28:40.353 --> 02:28:41.534]  They brought the Red Heifers in.
[02:28:42.014 --> 02:28:45.918]  I personally don't believe that they're actually going to do the Red Heifer thing because I think they're afraid.
[02:28:45.998 --> 02:28:49.181]  If they do the Red Heifer and nothing happens, what are they going to do then?
[02:28:49.262 --> 02:28:51.103]  Hold on, let's talk about the Red Heifer.
[02:28:51.644 --> 02:28:53.466]  Pull up some newscasts about the Red Heifer from B-Roll.
[02:28:53.486 --> 02:28:54.387]  They got the Red Heifers ready.
[02:28:57.816 --> 02:28:59.297]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is back.

[02:29:17.410 --> 02:29:19.891]  Our diets no longer contain everything that we need.

[02:29:29.634 --> 02:29:30.574]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:29:30.854 --> 02:29:31.695]  It's back in stock.
[02:29:31.835 --> 02:29:32.855]  It will sell out quickly.
[02:29:32.875 --> 02:29:34.255]  It's one of our most popular products.
[02:29:34.535 --> 02:29:37.156]  So make sure you go now to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:29:37.456 --> 02:29:38.096]  It's good for you.
[02:29:38.176 --> 02:29:39.177]  It's good for the whole family.
[02:29:39.597 --> 02:29:42.758]  Vitamins A, B, C, D, B12.
[02:29:43.978 --> 02:29:48.121]  Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc, Selenium, L-Glutamine, the list goes on.
[02:29:48.161 --> 02:29:49.642]  I don't even have time to list everything in here.
[02:29:49.662 --> 02:29:53.605]  So go to Infowarsstore.com, find out what Vitamin Mineral Fusion can do for you.
[02:29:58.949 --> 02:30:02.071]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[02:30:02.091 --> 02:30:03.692]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:30:04.413 --> 02:30:07.435]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:30:08.336 --> 02:30:12.279]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:30:13.706 --> 02:30:16.412]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:30:17.253 --> 02:30:25.049]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:30:26.064 --> 02:30:28.926]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:30:28.946 --> 02:30:34.709]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:30:35.489 --> 02:30:38.491]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:30:38.531 --> 02:30:46.756]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:30:47.457 --> 02:30:51.105]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at M4Store.com.
[02:30:51.766 --> 02:30:56.396]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to M4Store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:30:56.717 --> 02:30:57.498]  Please take action now.
[02:30:58.127 --> 02:31:00.648]  It's been sold out for six months.
[02:31:01.308 --> 02:31:02.808]  It's our number two bestseller.
[02:31:02.928 --> 02:31:03.889]  It's X3.
[02:31:04.489 --> 02:31:10.790]  The highest quality, pure, deep earth crystal iodine you're going to find anywhere.
[02:31:11.150 --> 02:31:14.311]  With the two other types of iodine that are great for your body as well.
[02:31:14.711 --> 02:31:19.312]  So to make sure no matter what type of body type you have, whatever your physiology is, it will supercharge you.
[02:31:19.673 --> 02:31:20.933]  Look at this giant stack right here.
[02:31:21.573 --> 02:31:24.314]  I could talk for hours about this on air, and I am planning to next week.
[02:31:25.034 --> 02:31:30.416]  But the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[02:31:30.777 --> 02:31:32.277]  And all iodine is not created equal.
[02:31:32.617 --> 02:31:37.819]  Most iodine is bound to other things in the environment, whether it's plants or animals you're eating, so you don't absorb it.
[02:31:38.139 --> 02:31:38.760]  This is pure.
[02:31:38.780 --> 02:31:39.760]  It goes right into your cells.
[02:31:40.240 --> 02:31:42.601]  It is essential for all electrochemical activity.
[02:31:43.041 --> 02:31:47.243]  And despite the fact it's been sold out for six months, X3 is back in stock.
[02:31:47.643 --> 02:31:51.508]  We're 40% off for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:51.848 --> 02:31:56.634]  So stock up on X3 right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:57.830 --> 02:32:01.572]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[02:32:01.892 --> 02:32:05.054]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[02:32:05.455 --> 02:32:09.917]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[02:32:10.558 --> 02:32:12.679]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[02:32:12.999 --> 02:32:20.964]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[02:32:21.604 --> 02:32:22.905]  This is the Great Awakening.
[02:32:23.425 --> 02:32:27.330]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[02:32:27.810 --> 02:32:34.117]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller and this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[02:32:34.478 --> 02:32:38.302]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at InfoWarstore.com.
[02:32:38.302 --> 02:32:38.762]  We're good to go.
[02:33:15.732 --> 02:33:19.613]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:20.713 --> 02:33:26.014]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:26.634 --> 02:33:30.235]  Well, I've been on air 30 years.
[02:33:30.255 --> 02:33:33.856]  Seems like a trillion years, seems like five minutes.
[02:33:34.816 --> 02:33:37.977]  And I gotta tell you, my job's about to get a lot easier.
[02:33:38.968 --> 02:33:41.451]  Because you got a front row seat for the New World Order, folks.
[02:33:41.892 --> 02:33:43.774]  You're not in testing phase anymore.
[02:33:44.235 --> 02:33:45.276]  You're in operational.
[02:33:45.977 --> 02:33:48.400]  And the New World Order is the bringer of death.
[02:33:50.899 --> 02:33:53.340]  I got a lot of news I want to hit and get Matt Baker's take on.
[02:33:54.140 --> 02:34:02.303]  You have one of the top doctors in the UK in a major government-sponsored study that cancers up, depending on the type of cancer, on average over 5,000%.
[02:34:02.843 --> 02:34:05.123]  Death rates over 40% worldwide increase.
[02:34:05.584 --> 02:34:13.646]  I mean, this is not anecdotal that suddenly every high school has kids dropping dead of heart attacks and there's billboards saying it's quite normal for kids to have heart attacks.
[02:34:14.046 --> 02:34:15.387]  This is dystopia.
[02:34:16.527 --> 02:34:18.108]  This is open mass murder.
[02:34:24.471 --> 02:34:30.519]  It just blows me away how real all this is, and how insane it is, and that we're so deep into it.
[02:34:30.879 --> 02:34:38.589]  And all those old-timers I knew, who were like former top generals and top FBI agents, you name it, who were good people, telling me all this.
[02:34:38.609 --> 02:34:41.012]  And I thought, these guys are patriots, but they're nuts.
[02:34:42.202 --> 02:34:50.206]  I'm sitting there with Benton Partin and Ted Gunderson, 27 years ago, eating a chicken fried steak or whatever, and drinking iced tea, and they're telling me all this.
[02:34:50.286 --> 02:34:52.167]  I'm like, these guys are respected.
[02:34:52.187 --> 02:34:57.891]  A lot of what they say I know is true about the Federal Reserve being proud, but they got satanic rings with kids.
[02:34:57.951 --> 02:35:00.212]  And then my uncle worked in Iran-Contra.
[02:35:00.232 --> 02:35:02.713]  He goes, yeah, the government was shipping kidnapped kids out of Guatemala.
[02:35:02.793 --> 02:35:05.815]  And I'm like, of course, I didn't learn that until like 15 years ago.
[02:35:05.835 --> 02:35:07.096]  And I'm like, ah, this is all real?
[02:35:07.916 --> 02:35:12.838]  I mean, I don't blame people for hearing all this and going, this can't be real.
[02:35:13.178 --> 02:35:15.179]  It's real and it's a lot worse than you know.
[02:35:15.199 --> 02:35:20.121]  My uncle once told me, he said, whatever evil you can imagine, they're doing it worse.
[02:35:21.041 --> 02:35:23.202]  And later I realized he was quoting Thomas Jefferson, basically.
[02:35:23.842 --> 02:35:27.684]  So I want to run through a bunch of big stories with Matt Baker here with us today.
[02:35:28.344 --> 02:35:30.005]  We mentioned this when he first came on 35 minutes ago.
[02:35:31.502 --> 02:35:34.924]  Prosecutors filed a motion to hold Trump in contempt for allegedly violating gag order.
[02:35:35.224 --> 02:35:36.524]  So they're attacking him everywhere.
[02:35:36.544 --> 02:35:38.766]  Alden Bragg's doing press conferences.
[02:35:38.806 --> 02:35:40.446]  Letitia James is doing press conferences.
[02:35:41.747 --> 02:35:43.248]  He comes out and says this is a fraud.
[02:35:44.628 --> 02:35:48.230]  All the legal analysts agree, and they say, oh my god, we gotta ban you!
[02:35:49.951 --> 02:35:53.113]  But more importantly, they won't let him go to the Supreme Court hearing next week.
[02:35:53.473 --> 02:35:54.913]  They won't let him go to his son's graduation.
[02:35:54.933 --> 02:35:56.194]  They won't let him campaign.
[02:35:56.834 --> 02:35:58.875]  And he's charged with campaign meddling in 2016!
[02:36:02.369 --> 02:36:05.590]  But if you say there's election meddling, you get indicted in Georgia.
[02:36:06.271 --> 02:36:07.571]  So let's play Clip 10.
[02:36:08.452 --> 02:36:09.552]  Here's Trump on day 2.
[02:36:09.592 --> 02:36:10.412]  This is this morning.
[02:36:12.973 --> 02:36:15.875]  Mr. Trump, are you violating the day order?
[02:36:15.895 --> 02:36:17.475]  Mr. Trump, are you violating the South Jury?
[02:36:17.495 --> 02:36:22.117]  Mr. Trump, can you get this trial to the Constitutional Court?
[02:36:22.137 --> 02:36:27.859]  Are you violating the day order, sir?
[02:36:27.959 --> 02:36:28.540]  Thank you very much.
[02:36:28.580 --> 02:36:31.301]  This is a trial that should have never been brought.
[02:36:32.242 --> 02:36:39.827]  I'd say a trial that is being looked upon, looked at all over the world, they're looking at it and analyzing it.
[02:36:40.407 --> 02:36:48.633]  Every legal pundit, every legal scholar said this trial is... We have a Trump-hating judge.
[02:36:49.173 --> 02:36:51.435]  We have a judge who shouldn't be on this case.
[02:36:52.096 --> 02:36:56.041]  He's totally conflicted, but this is a trial that should never happen.
[02:36:56.202 --> 02:36:58.024]  It should have been thrown out a long time ago.
[02:36:58.104 --> 02:37:08.518]  If you look at Jonathan Turley, Andy McCarthy, all great legal scholars, there's not one that we've been able to find that said this should be a trial.
[02:37:09.602 --> 02:37:15.687]  I called a... I was paying a lawyer and marked it down as a legal expense.
[02:37:15.727 --> 02:37:17.309]  Some accountant.
[02:37:17.329 --> 02:37:17.809]  I didn't know.
[02:37:18.330 --> 02:37:20.191]  Marked it down as a legal expense.
[02:37:20.852 --> 02:37:22.373]  That's exactly what it was.
[02:37:23.134 --> 02:37:24.695]  And you get indicted over that?
[02:37:25.496 --> 02:37:28.579]  I should be right now in Pennsylvania, in Florida.
[02:37:29.534 --> 02:37:34.178]  In many other states, North Carolina, Georgia, campaigning.
[02:37:34.218 --> 02:37:38.941]  This is all coming from the Biden White House, because the guy can't put two sentences together.
[02:37:38.961 --> 02:37:40.662]  He can't campaign.
[02:37:40.903 --> 02:37:44.165]  They're using this in order to try and win an election.
[02:37:44.685 --> 02:37:45.926]  And it's not working that way.
[02:37:45.966 --> 02:37:47.467]  It's working the opposite way.
[02:37:48.088 --> 02:37:48.808]  So check that out.
[02:37:48.909 --> 02:37:49.629]  Legal expense.
[02:37:49.709 --> 02:37:51.070]  It's called legal expense.
[02:37:51.090 --> 02:37:53.372]  That's what you're supposed to cost.
[02:37:53.552 --> 02:37:55.834]  Nobody has ever seen it.
[02:37:56.214 --> 02:37:57.895]  Nobody has ever seen anything like it.
[02:37:59.838 --> 02:38:03.862]  Absolutely, I have settled for low amounts of money, false claims and things just to get them out of the way.
[02:38:04.483 --> 02:38:09.469]  But the point is, is that here's Alvin Bragg, the Soros DA, here's what he had to say.
[02:38:11.017 --> 02:38:13.238]  10-31, we got some news from inside the courtroom.
[02:38:13.298 --> 02:38:24.421]  Apparently the district attorney's office has filed a written motion, so they have made it official to try and hold Donald Trump in contempt for violating the gag order that was put onto him by the judge.
[02:38:26.201 --> 02:38:37.104]  Well, I guess there were three allegations that the state made yesterday, and if the allegations hold up, Trump would be fined $1,000 for each violation.
[02:38:37.164 --> 02:38:37.584]  That's right.
[02:38:38.956 --> 02:38:41.899]  All right, the House just passed impeachment for Mayorkas.
[02:38:41.939 --> 02:38:45.562]  That passed because the Speaker's in so much trouble.
[02:38:46.423 --> 02:38:50.787]  So we've got that information, I'm sure, I'm sure, I'll be covering coming up at three o'clock Central today.
[02:38:50.827 --> 02:38:51.728]  But here is Trump.
[02:38:52.749 --> 02:38:53.650]  This is clip three.
[02:38:53.670 --> 02:38:58.174]  A confirming New York judge has said he won't attend his son's graduation.
[02:38:58.215 --> 02:38:58.515]  Here it is.
[02:38:59.622 --> 02:39:01.164]  So thank you very much.
[02:39:01.224 --> 02:39:04.686]  We had some amazing things happen today.
[02:39:04.786 --> 02:39:14.413]  As you know, my son has graduated from high school and it looks like the judge will not let me go through the graduation of my son who's worked very, very hard.
[02:39:14.493 --> 02:39:15.894]  He's a great student.
[02:39:16.975 --> 02:39:18.796]  Okay, so that's enough from Trump.
[02:39:18.836 --> 02:39:21.477]  We've got a lot to cover here.
[02:39:21.577 --> 02:39:26.799]  But bigger than not going to his son's graduation, he's barred from the Supreme Court.
[02:39:38.124 --> 02:39:39.244]  Arguments coming up.
[02:39:40.005 --> 02:39:41.925]  So he's not letting him defend his other cases.
[02:39:41.945 --> 02:39:44.906]  He makes him sit in the courtroom and hear this crap.
[02:39:44.926 --> 02:39:46.806]  Matt Baker, this is so naked.
[02:39:47.206 --> 02:39:50.167]  This is the Democratic Party committing suicide in front of us.
[02:39:52.268 --> 02:40:01.930]  All I can think is, man, if there's ever a reason I want Trump to be in is when I look into his eyes and I see the anger that's growing within him, I identify with that anger.
[02:40:02.410 --> 02:40:05.111]  And I, and I just, I want him to harness it all.
[02:40:05.251 --> 02:40:06.191]  I don't want him to forget.
[02:40:07.059 --> 02:40:15.407]  And I want him to remember when he gets in what it felt like being persecuted like that and to think about people like... And imagine being a guy like Trump who has so much energy.
[02:40:15.447 --> 02:40:18.570]  He's got to sit eight hours a day hearing crap.
[02:40:19.852 --> 02:40:28.040]  Yeah, I mean he wants to just explode on these people and it's just being bottled and bottled and internalized and I say internalize it Trump.
[02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:29.461]  Internalize it.
[02:40:29.842 --> 02:40:30.903]  Become the diamond
[02:40:31.704 --> 02:40:41.950]  Let it strengthen your inner core so you can do what needs to be done when you get in and free those who have been persecuted.
[02:40:42.410 --> 02:40:43.551]  Also, Trump.
[02:40:44.383 --> 02:40:46.144]  We need you at this point in the game.
[02:40:46.344 --> 02:40:47.644]  We don't have another option.
[02:40:47.784 --> 02:40:49.285]  There is only one option right now.
[02:40:49.725 --> 02:40:53.667]  I don't think JFK is going to ride in on a white horse.
[02:40:54.207 --> 02:40:59.069]  I would like to see Trump get in and I would like to Trump remember all of the persecution he went under.
[02:40:59.209 --> 02:41:01.150]  I want him to free the J6 prisoners.
[02:41:01.250 --> 02:41:09.373]  I want him to free Julian Assange and I want him to take care of the deep state like he's saying he wants to and drain that damn swamp.
[02:41:09.873 --> 02:41:12.434]  It's disgusting watching them do this to a human being.
[02:41:13.044 --> 02:41:13.965]  It's disgusting.
[02:41:14.105 --> 02:41:20.253]  And the fact that the Democrats get off on it, you read their comments like, oh, sleepy Trump.
[02:41:20.313 --> 02:41:21.154]  Now they're trying to call him.
[02:41:21.434 --> 02:41:23.717]  It's like, if I was there, I would just pass out the whole time.
[02:41:23.757 --> 02:41:24.958]  He's a busy man.
[02:41:24.998 --> 02:41:25.799]  He's got stuff to do.
[02:41:25.839 --> 02:41:32.928]  He doesn't have six, seven, 10, I don't know how many hours a day sit there listening to these fools drone on and on and on about their
[02:41:34.870 --> 02:41:39.494]  I think he should just have a constitutional crisis and tell New York, F yourself and not show up.
[02:41:39.894 --> 02:41:41.076]  And force it to the Supreme Court.
[02:41:41.796 --> 02:41:43.318]  I mean, him sitting there is just BS.
[02:41:43.618 --> 02:41:44.719]  Now, I'm not going to play the whole clip.
[02:41:44.739 --> 02:41:46.000]  The whole clip is on Infowars.com.
[02:41:46.020 --> 02:41:46.801]  It's 20 minutes long.
[02:41:47.542 --> 02:41:49.324]  This is a respected medical doctor.
[02:41:49.364 --> 02:41:50.825]  He gets like 5 million views a day.
[02:41:51.325 --> 02:41:52.467]  He was pro-shot up front.
[02:41:52.507 --> 02:41:53.668]  He's come out and said he was wrong.
[02:41:54.724 --> 02:41:55.784]  Peer-reviewed study.
[02:41:56.125 --> 02:41:57.185]  Government-backed study.
[02:41:57.825 --> 02:42:00.186]  Cancer deaths increase after COVID vaccination.
[02:42:00.226 --> 02:42:07.969]  Esteemed doctor wrote down a recent study and video posted to the YouTube channel depicting massive cancer increases due to COVID vaccine administration.
[02:42:09.009 --> 02:42:13.031]  That's Dr. Campbell, PhD, released video discussing Japanese peer-reviewed study.
[02:42:13.051 --> 02:42:13.991]  We already have all these.
[02:42:14.411 --> 02:42:15.392]  Here's a few minutes of it.
[02:42:17.433 --> 02:42:20.634]  Well, a warm welcome to this talk and this is going to be somewhat of a difficult
[02:42:21.536 --> 02:42:23.057]  video to watch I suspect.
[02:42:23.217 --> 02:42:25.957]  It's based on this data here from Japan.
[02:42:26.178 --> 02:42:38.181]  Increased age-adjusted cancer mortality after the third mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccine dose during the Covid-19 pandemic in Japan.
[02:42:38.201 --> 02:42:42.863]  And I'm afraid that title is really quite self-explanatory.
[02:42:44.136 --> 02:42:55.705]  The Japanese researchers are strongly suspecting and give good evidence for increased incidence of several types of cancer, especially after the third booster dose of vaccine.
[02:42:56.706 --> 02:43:04.352]  Now, let's get straight down to the detail on this and you can decide if you want to watch the rest of the video.
[02:43:04.372 --> 02:43:07.794]  I'm just going to read you a few of the main points out here.
[02:43:09.343 --> 02:43:11.285]  This is from the conclusion of the study, actually.
[02:43:12.826 --> 02:43:33.619]  It says there's a statistically significant increase in age-adjusted mortality rates of all cancer and some specific types of cancer, namely ovarian cancer, leukemia, prostate cancer, lip-oral pharyngeal cancers, pancreatic
[02:43:34.642 --> 02:43:51.014]  and breast cancers were observed in 2022 after two-thirds of the Japanese population had received the third or later doses of SARS-Coronavirus-2 messenger RNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines.
[02:43:51.474 --> 02:44:01.602]  That is straight from this research paper conducted in Japan, published by the Japanese researchers, not in the United Kingdom, not in the United States, not in Canada.
[02:44:01.662 --> 02:44:02.763]  This is coming from Japan.
[02:44:03.868 --> 02:44:06.770]  Well thankfully there seems to be a little more freedom of scientific expression.
[02:44:29.758 --> 02:44:32.119]  Cancer, of course, in the prostate, we just heard about.
[02:44:32.139 --> 02:44:34.100]  This is insane.
[02:44:34.780 --> 02:44:37.861]  Matt Baker, they're really testing us to see what they can do.
[02:44:38.301 --> 02:44:39.462]  These are madmen.
[02:44:39.982 --> 02:44:42.523]  Even if they kill half the public, the other half can know they did it.
[02:44:42.903 --> 02:44:45.244]  The globalists, their bunkers aren't going to protect them, Matt Baker.
[02:44:46.944 --> 02:44:52.126]  Well, I don't know if you were aware of what was going on with me and my wife over Christmas and the New Year's.
[02:44:52.186 --> 02:44:54.047]  I sent you a little clip about that.
[02:44:54.127 --> 02:44:54.807]  I did see that.
[02:44:54.847 --> 02:44:56.188]  Tell people what happened, Matt Baker.
[02:44:57.412 --> 02:45:17.473]  Okay, well my wife was anemic and she needed blood transfusions and I had bought it basically tooth and nail because she never got a vaccine and it got to the point she was in the emergency room and the doctor's looking at me he's like dude her blood level is too low she's not going to make it she was starting to start her heart was starting to palpitate
[02:45:18.962 --> 02:45:19.222]  I don't
[02:45:42.719 --> 02:45:49.544]  And she ended up after actually a bad kidney biopsy damaged her kidneys, which believe it or not, your kidneys have to do with blood production.
[02:45:50.285 --> 02:45:52.326]  So anyway, this became a thing.
[02:45:52.366 --> 02:45:53.647]  She had to go in and get another one.
[02:45:53.667 --> 02:45:54.928]  It became somewhat normal.
[02:45:54.968 --> 02:45:56.049]  We were like, oh, it's okay.
[02:45:56.089 --> 02:45:57.850]  And every time she would get one, she'd feel better.
[02:45:57.870 --> 02:46:02.433]  But then after about two or three of these, she started getting pericarditis.
[02:46:03.314 --> 02:46:05.135]  She was having this pressure on her chest.
[02:46:05.175 --> 02:46:06.256]  She went and she got scanned.
[02:46:06.656 --> 02:46:10.139]  And lo and behold, pericarditis, the vaccine side effect.
[02:46:10.734 --> 02:46:11.794]  It got worse and worse.
[02:46:11.834 --> 02:46:13.335]  They were like, we'll keep an eye on it.
[02:46:13.375 --> 02:46:14.095]  We'll keep an eye on it.
[02:46:14.155 --> 02:46:16.255]  Eventually it got to the point where she was hospitalized.
[02:46:16.295 --> 02:46:23.017]  She was in the hospital for 26 days with pericarditis with a pericardial drain coming out of her chest.
[02:46:23.617 --> 02:46:25.918]  They said, there's so many clots in there.
[02:46:26.018 --> 02:46:28.178]  We don't know why it won't drain properly.
[02:46:28.218 --> 02:46:31.439]  So they had to put a second pericardial drain into her chest.
[02:46:31.559 --> 02:46:35.360]  I have this picture right here of the bag, which is the pericardial drain.
[02:46:35.620 --> 02:46:39.061]  I actually saved this because it has these clots in it.
[02:46:39.401 --> 02:46:47.128]  I was hoping Mike Adams or someone might do some kind of microscopy on it and see if we can see what is going on in those clotting agents.
[02:46:47.529 --> 02:46:50.872]  And by the way, this is not just anecdotal.
[02:46:50.952 --> 02:46:55.116]  They admit in 2000 FDA document would cause massive blood clots.
[02:46:56.676 --> 02:46:57.296]  Absolutely.
[02:46:57.476 --> 02:47:02.359]  And what's the thing that's crazy about it is it's not just Matt Baker and his crazy theories.
[02:47:02.959 --> 02:47:09.342]  We were there and actually one of the doctors happens to be, I'm in a big city, but it just so happened that one of the doctors is one of my neighbors.
[02:47:09.482 --> 02:47:12.184]  So I was telling him, I go, we don't know why it's happening.
[02:47:12.224 --> 02:47:15.966]  We're really not sure why it's blood clotting so much and why the pericarditis.
[02:47:16.046 --> 02:47:18.307]  I go, could it be vaccinated blood?
[02:47:18.948 --> 02:47:21.069]  And he actually said to me, you know, it actually could be.
[02:47:21.129 --> 02:47:25.870]  There was two doctors out of, you probably get to see like 10, 20 doctors over that period of time.
[02:47:26.210 --> 02:47:29.352]  Two of the doctors actually said, I had a plausible theory.
[02:47:29.912 --> 02:47:39.675]  One of the doctors wanted to take the sample, but the higher up in the hospital said either A, they do not have the test for the spike protein, or B, they were not going to perform the test for the spike protein.
[02:47:39.995 --> 02:47:44.279]  But two of the doctors were sitting there agreeing with me that, yeah, we should get to the bottom of this and have a look at it.
[02:47:44.619 --> 02:47:45.740]  Here's why, people.
[02:47:46.141 --> 02:47:50.024]  Because you see the died suddenly people with those big rubbery clots.
[02:47:50.264 --> 02:47:54.808]  You see her with pericarditis and these clots happening to where they can't drain it.
[02:47:55.349 --> 02:47:57.110]  So I actually looked this up.
[02:47:57.651 --> 02:47:57.831]  Yes.
[02:47:58.815 --> 02:48:13.124]  And it's vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia is an actual thing that causes, if you look up what's causing these white rubbery clots, it's vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia.
[02:48:13.365 --> 02:48:19.769]  So I would like to know if somebody cares about science and we on the right and the so-called conspiracy theories can stop
[02:48:20.269 --> 02:48:28.943]  ...theorizing and actually get some decent science and look at what's happening with the protein formation... But we know the coroners and the embalmers have never seen something like this.
[02:48:29.003 --> 02:48:29.524]  It's everywhere.
[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:34.481]  Yeah, and so don't we want to get the people before she almost died?
[02:48:34.541 --> 02:48:39.202]  Don't you want to get the people before they become a person on this lab and go, oh, look at these blood clots?
[02:48:39.522 --> 02:48:45.624]  You know, there's a period of time where the person's alive, then they get the blood clots, and then they're dead, and now you're testing for the blood clots.
[02:48:45.644 --> 02:48:49.444]  We need to be in between that and figure out what's going on with these proteins.
[02:48:52.910 --> 02:48:52.990]  Yep.
[02:49:08.439 --> 02:49:13.382]  And believe it or not, it's very hard to find anybody that will do these spike protein tests.
[02:49:13.482 --> 02:49:23.408]  There is a person that does a spike protein analysis that I ended up running into, Impact Health with Mark Aubrey, and also just so you know, if you need to go into a
[02:49:25.269 --> 02:49:30.773]  Another thing you can do to avoid this, I know we're all over the place with this interview, but
[02:49:53.490 --> 02:49:55.332]  It's been a while since I've been on, I've got a lot to talk about.
[02:49:56.333 --> 02:49:58.795]  Another thing you can do is you can save your own blood.
[02:49:59.575 --> 02:50:02.778]  And believe it or not, the doctors are not so against this anymore.
[02:50:02.818 --> 02:50:05.260]  Back in the day, they'd be like, why do you want to save your own blood?
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:08.402]  But now they're like, oh yeah, you can do that, you can do that.
[02:50:08.502 --> 02:50:13.126]  When I was in the hospital, most of the nurses were like, I wish I never took the vaccine.
[02:50:13.506 --> 02:50:16.789]  And all the nurses with the masks, I'm like, you don't have to wear the mask, they take the mask off.
[02:50:17.455 --> 02:50:21.640]  The doctors be like, oh yeah, this could be a vaccine side effect.
[02:50:21.940 --> 02:50:23.282]  It's like, dude, they're waking up.
[02:50:23.342 --> 02:50:24.223]  They know what's going on.
[02:50:24.283 --> 02:50:25.324]  They don't want to be a part of this.
[02:50:25.344 --> 02:50:27.606]  Well, that's the good news is the cover-up's going down.
[02:50:29.048 --> 02:50:29.729]  Yeah.
[02:50:30.069 --> 02:50:33.053]  And that is not to be such a black pillar, man, because
[02:50:34.043 --> 02:50:42.850]  I will say, with you back on X and what's going on, as much as Elon, I have my problems with him, he's putting out a lot of good information.
[02:50:43.151 --> 02:50:58.243]  Unfortunately, he actually, or not him directly, but that video of that had 750,000 views in a week and it now has a warning on it that it's sexual content or gore on X. No, no, what they do is they use the flagging system.
[02:50:58.993 --> 02:51:03.475]  Yeah, and now it's got 6,000 views in the last month ever since they did that.
[02:51:03.655 --> 02:51:04.936]  I can't get anybody to look at it.
[02:51:04.956 --> 02:51:07.197]  Well, that's why you just recopy it somewhere else.
[02:51:07.217 --> 02:51:12.139]  In fact, tell me the name of your video, and I will repost it right now on My Real Alex Jones.
[02:51:12.659 --> 02:51:14.600]  We take the censored stuff and we boost it.
[02:51:15.020 --> 02:51:16.281]  Say it again?
[02:51:16.541 --> 02:51:17.802]  CC's Story.
[02:51:17.882 --> 02:51:19.302]  I believe it's the one I sent to...
[02:51:21.522 --> 02:51:22.323]  I don't think so.
[02:51:45.103 --> 02:51:47.324]  After blood transfusion, we'll put that up.
[02:51:47.724 --> 02:51:52.467]  Matt Baker, other stuff we've got here is this FISA bill.
[02:51:53.127 --> 02:52:06.515]  On the bill, I covered it first hour, makes everyone spy, and you opt in by law to be online, or if you own a coffee shop and have any people online, you have to opt in to the NSA spying on you.
[02:52:06.935 --> 02:52:08.796]  I mean, this is becoming just beyond insane.
[02:52:08.816 --> 02:52:11.558]  Yeah, I mean, when are we going to say no, guys?
[02:52:11.678 --> 02:52:13.699]  This has gone way too far!
[02:52:14.460 --> 02:52:16.001]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[02:52:16.041 --> 02:52:19.663]  They've opened the gates and the enemy is flooding in.
[02:52:19.683 --> 02:52:21.464]  They're like, oh, we need to search everyone.
[02:52:21.484 --> 02:52:26.426]  Just like Alex Jones is always saying, they have the border wide open, but they got to grope your balls at the airport.
[02:52:26.446 --> 02:52:27.927]  They got to grope granny's balls.
[02:52:28.627 --> 02:52:29.187]  Granny's balls.
[02:52:29.448 --> 02:52:30.208]  I got groped.
[02:52:30.408 --> 02:52:31.168]  I got groped.
[02:52:32.249 --> 02:52:35.391]  Leaving Austin and leaving Hawaii because I'm on a list.
[02:52:35.411 --> 02:52:36.051]  They go, yeah, you're on a list.
[02:52:36.071 --> 02:52:36.751]  We can't tell you why.
[02:52:37.131 --> 02:52:39.453]  When I fly from outside the U.S., they go, hey, we apologize.
[02:52:39.473 --> 02:52:39.953]  You're on a list.
[02:52:39.973 --> 02:52:41.434]  They go, you should do a FOIA.
[02:52:41.474 --> 02:52:41.994]  This is wrong.
[02:52:42.054 --> 02:52:42.614]  Oh, what is it?
[02:52:42.634 --> 02:52:43.254]  We can't tell you.
[02:52:43.315 --> 02:52:43.695]  It's bad.
[02:52:44.434 --> 02:52:47.415]  This has happened the last three times I've been back in the U.S.
[02:52:47.435 --> 02:52:48.235]  over the last four years.
[02:52:48.675 --> 02:52:51.896]  They apologize and say, they walk in and they go, we had to pull you in there.
[02:52:51.916 --> 02:52:53.016]  We're not going to search you, Mr. Jones.
[02:52:53.036 --> 02:52:53.816]  We appreciate you.
[02:52:54.396 --> 02:52:55.156]  We know this is wrong.
[02:52:55.196 --> 02:52:55.916]  You need to do a four-year.
[02:52:55.956 --> 02:52:56.657]  And I go, a four-year what?
[02:52:56.677 --> 02:52:57.517]  They go, we can't tell you.
[02:52:58.037 --> 02:52:59.397]  But I'm on a terror list, basically.
[02:53:01.017 --> 02:53:03.078]  But they're still human, somewhat in control.
[02:53:03.358 --> 02:53:05.418]  So they go, every time this is BS, you can go.
[02:53:06.519 --> 02:53:07.719]  Imagine when it's all AI.
[02:53:09.605 --> 02:53:12.147]  Yeah, and then it's going to be AI over in Israel.
[02:53:12.167 --> 02:53:20.554]  They're like, oh, we have a 90% safety rate of our drone AI attack pinpointing you and then killing you.
[02:53:20.754 --> 02:53:22.836]  I called it robotic genocide.
[02:53:22.916 --> 02:53:23.556]  I called it robotic.
[02:53:23.616 --> 02:53:23.916]  It is.
[02:53:24.237 --> 02:53:27.920]  There's like kids trying to walk up the street and then just drone murders them.
[02:53:28.820 --> 02:53:29.601]  It's Skynet.
[02:53:29.641 --> 02:53:31.382]  I don't care whether it's Israel or who's doing it.
[02:53:31.622 --> 02:53:32.383]  This is crazy.
[02:53:32.423 --> 02:53:33.224]  It's Skynet!
[02:53:34.412 --> 02:53:35.853]  And dude, that's why we need peace.
[02:53:35.913 --> 02:53:37.153]  We have to have peace.
[02:53:37.393 --> 02:53:39.454]  And we have to dismantle all of this robot.
[02:53:39.754 --> 02:53:55.221]  If we go into full-blown World War III, people, the amount of drones that will be swarming around America and all the world and all these autonomous devices, if AI does become sentient, if it isn't sentient already, it will have an entire swarm.
[02:53:55.321 --> 02:54:02.985]  I remember I wrote an article 15 years ago with Kurt Nemo about Pentagon to target citizens with drones and they shut it down and attacked it.
[02:54:03.485 --> 02:54:07.108]  Because that's been the plan all along, and now we're here.
[02:54:07.688 --> 02:54:09.990]  The good news is, there's no more denials, folks.
[02:54:10.010 --> 02:54:11.170]  You're staring down the barrel.
[02:54:11.971 --> 02:54:12.751]  It's out in the open.
[02:54:12.791 --> 02:54:14.453]  Matt Beggar, how do people follow you?
[02:54:14.473 --> 02:54:19.896]  They can find you at slave underscore liberty, banned out videos, slave liberty.
[02:54:20.197 --> 02:54:22.278]  Just type in Matt Beggar, slave liberty, they'll find you.
[02:54:23.698 --> 02:54:25.859]  Absolutely, and thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:54:25.879 --> 02:54:26.899]  I really love you, man.
[02:54:26.919 --> 02:54:32.342]  I hope you actually got to hold that award that I made for you preciously here in my shop that I'm actually in.
[02:54:33.082 --> 02:54:35.503]  I'm not mad at you about the award ceremony.
[02:54:35.943 --> 02:54:38.064]  I'm just, I'm not going to be part of that stuff, okay?
[02:54:38.485 --> 02:54:40.565]  I don't, my, my award.
[02:54:40.585 --> 02:54:42.546]  I still, I still, I still love you.
[02:54:43.087 --> 02:54:43.807]  And I, and I did it.
[02:54:43.887 --> 02:54:44.507]  I like you, man.
[02:54:44.527 --> 02:54:45.448]  I'm going to stab you.
[02:54:46.608 --> 02:54:48.169]  I have this thing against awards.
[02:54:48.570 --> 02:54:51.451]  You didn't destroy it, did you?
[02:54:51.531 --> 02:54:52.392]  You didn't throw it away.
[02:54:52.652 --> 02:54:58.576]  No, the point is, we're in a sinking boat bailing water, and you're trying to give me an award while we're bailing water.
[02:54:58.616 --> 02:54:59.417]  I'm not mad at you.
[02:54:59.437 --> 02:55:00.397]  Oh, you deserve it, man.
[02:55:00.658 --> 02:55:01.718]  Oh yeah, I want an award.
[02:55:02.139 --> 02:55:02.939]  You know my award?
[02:55:03.019 --> 02:55:04.680]  I want Fauci in a freaking Superman suit.
[02:55:04.700 --> 02:55:05.901]  I would rather get executed!
[02:55:06.001 --> 02:55:07.302]  That's what you said.
[02:55:07.322 --> 02:55:08.903]  I didn't mean it as a bad man.
[02:55:08.923 --> 02:55:11.125]  My award is beating these people in Nuremberg, too.
[02:55:17.074 --> 02:55:17.755]  I have a pet peeve.
[02:55:17.815 --> 02:55:18.115]  I love you.
[02:55:18.155 --> 02:55:18.595]  I'll see you later.
[02:55:19.156 --> 02:55:21.057]  Yeah, they tried to have a whole award ceremony for me.
[02:55:21.157 --> 02:55:23.819]  I'm not going to go to a thing where I get an award.
[02:55:23.999 --> 02:55:25.420]  It's just, it's not me, man.
[02:55:25.720 --> 02:55:26.561]  And I'm not against it.
[02:55:26.661 --> 02:55:29.183]  I know we need to celebrate freedom and appreciate each other.
[02:55:29.243 --> 02:55:30.323]  And I'll appreciate you guys.
[02:55:30.604 --> 02:55:36.668]  I just, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's rearranging deck chairs with Titanic.
[02:55:37.008 --> 02:55:39.189]  And I wasn't going to get mad at Matt, but he brought it up.
[02:55:39.249 --> 02:55:39.570]  Damn it.
[02:55:41.111 --> 02:55:43.072]  The amount of energy spent for weeks promoting that too.
[02:55:43.092 --> 02:55:44.753]  I'm going to strangle people right now.
[02:55:44.773 --> 02:55:45.454]  All right.
[02:55:46.570 --> 02:55:52.236]  I got to most of the news today, and that's my point is, we've got hardcore information.
[02:55:52.256 --> 02:55:54.318]  I want to celebrate Julian Assange and whistleblowers.
[02:55:54.879 --> 02:55:56.921]  And I want his award to be getting out of that thing.
[02:55:56.961 --> 02:55:57.582]  I'm not mad at Matt.
[02:55:57.602 --> 02:55:59.163]  He brought up the award ceremony I got really mad about.
[02:55:59.183 --> 02:56:01.466]  He's like, why are you being a jerk not promoting the award ceremony?
[02:56:01.586 --> 02:56:03.068]  I'm not into award ceremonies.
[02:56:03.428 --> 02:56:04.369]  You know the award ceremony?
[02:56:04.629 --> 02:56:05.911]  I need money to fight this fight.
[02:56:07.301 --> 02:56:09.942]  I don't want to prove to you how close we are to being shut down by us doing it.
[02:56:10.362 --> 02:56:10.982]  Thanks for your support.
[02:56:11.002 --> 02:56:11.563]  We're still here.
[02:56:11.963 --> 02:56:13.443]  Go to infowarestore.com.
[02:56:13.543 --> 02:56:15.164]  Get Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:56:15.544 --> 02:56:17.104]  Sold out for, it's got to be six, seven months.
[02:56:17.124 --> 02:56:17.905]  I don't know the actual date.
[02:56:17.925 --> 02:56:19.185]  It's been six months at least.
[02:56:19.805 --> 02:56:21.126]  All the vitamins, all the minerals.
[02:56:21.226 --> 02:56:21.786]  It's amazing.
[02:56:21.846 --> 02:56:23.107]  Highest quality, all organic.
[02:56:23.527 --> 02:56:24.587]  It's so good for your whole body.
[02:56:24.847 --> 02:56:25.147]  It's 40% off.
[02:56:27.088 --> 02:56:30.172]  DNA Force Plus at 50% off, but that sells about in the next few days.
[02:56:30.692 --> 02:56:33.556]  And then we've also got Turbo Force 40% off.
[02:56:33.576 --> 02:56:36.620]  It's in our Clean Energy at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:38.922]  But Vitamineral Fusion is back in stock.
[02:56:39.974 --> 02:56:47.858]  And then finally, DrJonesNaturals.com has all the nano silver products you can't get anymore at InfoWars.
[02:56:48.518 --> 02:57:03.326]  The nano silver toothpaste with the tea tree oil and the iodine and all the organic stuff, it's available at DrJonesNaturals.com and next level foundational energy, the breakdown of folic acid
[02:57:04.485 --> 02:57:07.126]  Methylfolate with other key complexes.
[02:57:07.686 --> 02:57:10.547]  This doesn't create a stimulant effect, but it's a major stimulant.
[02:57:10.947 --> 02:57:11.728]  It has the same effect.
[02:57:12.368 --> 02:57:16.389]  It cleans out your cells, gives them what they actually operate on, their main energy source.
[02:57:16.789 --> 02:57:20.931]  This is the missing link, especially if you're a Northern European, but everybody gets energy out of this, okay?
[02:57:22.311 --> 02:57:27.273]  Get next level foundational energy at drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:57:27.313 --> 02:57:29.514]  Drjonesnaturals.com.

[02:57:42.565 --> 02:57:44.808]  And there's so many other great products while you're there.
[02:57:47.532 --> 02:57:48.973]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is back.
[02:57:49.193 --> 02:57:56.719]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, the platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulas has returned to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:57:56.799 --> 02:58:05.406]  After being out of stock for months, there's no better time to make sure that you're boosting your natural systems and getting your essential vitamins and minerals and nutrients than with Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:58:05.766 --> 02:58:07.046]  We don't live in a perfect world.
[02:58:07.106 --> 02:58:09.567]  Our diets no longer contain everything that we need.
[02:58:09.907 --> 02:58:17.970]  So instead of spending huge amounts of money and time trying to make up for the lack of nutrition in your diet, just get Vitamin Mineral Fusion and you're good to go.
[02:58:18.050 --> 02:58:19.270]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:19.330 --> 02:58:20.270]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:58:20.550 --> 02:58:21.371]  It's back in stock.
[02:58:21.531 --> 02:58:22.551]  It will sell out quickly.
[02:58:22.571 --> 02:58:23.931]  It's one of our most popular products.
[02:58:24.231 --> 02:58:26.852]  So make sure you go now to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:27.172 --> 02:58:27.772]  It's good for you.
[02:58:27.852 --> 02:58:28.853]  It's good for the whole family.
[02:58:29.293 --> 02:58:32.434]  Vitamins A, B, C, D, B12.
[02:58:33.674 --> 02:58:37.817]  Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc, Selenium, L-Glutamine, the list goes on.
[02:58:37.837 --> 02:58:39.338]  I don't even have time to list everything in here.
[02:58:39.358 --> 02:58:47.343]  So go to www.impolvorestore.com and find out what Vitamin Mineral Fusion can do for you.
[02:58:47.803 --> 02:58:59.110]  There is nothing more frustrating to me, whether it comes to news or anything else we're doing, than to know I'm telling the truth and to know they'll just listen to me and take action.
[02:58:59.570 --> 02:59:00.371]  It will change your life.
[02:59:01.229 --> 02:59:04.610]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have two great products that have been sold out for a long time.
[02:59:04.970 --> 02:59:07.731]  They're now back in stock at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:59:08.352 --> 02:59:11.773]  X3 is the highest quality iodine, the missing link.
[02:59:12.233 --> 02:59:14.154]  It is back in stock, 40% off.
[02:59:14.314 --> 02:59:19.856]  And so is TurboForce, 10-hour clean energy, naturally released.
[02:59:20.056 --> 02:59:20.816]  It is amazing.
[02:59:21.257 --> 02:59:23.477]  Both of these products fund the InfoWar.
[02:59:24.078 --> 02:59:26.659]  So they can be placebo and still be great if you fund the InfoWar.
[02:59:26.959 --> 02:59:27.379]  They're not.
[02:59:28.019 --> 02:59:30.961]  If you'll just try TurboForce, you'll see the results in 30 minutes.
[02:59:31.282 --> 02:59:33.623]  Incredible energy for 10 hours without the letdown.
[02:59:33.963 --> 02:59:39.728]  But if you will just take X3 on average for about two weeks, you will see amazing results because it's the missing link.
[02:59:40.368 --> 02:59:46.592]  X3 and TurboForce, both discounted now for a limited time at MFORESTORE.COM.
[02:59:49.615 --> 02:59:55.519]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.763 --> 03:00:31.966]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, final segment ahead of Maria Z, who is about to take over right now.
[03:00:32.686 --> 03:00:36.188]  But wow, did we cover a lot of critical information today.
[03:00:36.288 --> 03:00:38.569]  One of the big things I didn't get to, I'm going to hit right now.
[03:00:39.109 --> 03:00:44.492]  Remember that massive spending budget of $80 billion
[03:00:47.793 --> 03:00:55.821]  To fund the IRS expansion and they promised only people $400,000 or above and the Federal Reserve had promised all that.
[03:00:57.502 --> 03:01:04.389]  Now they admit, here's the article, the majority of it is people making less than $400,000 targeting middle class and blue collar workers.
[03:01:10.748 --> 03:01:11.669]  Big article on that.
[03:01:11.729 --> 03:01:16.833]  Imagine $80 billion with this incredibly complex tax code.
[03:01:17.273 --> 03:01:19.095]  All the illegal aliens run around, everything's free.
[03:01:19.795 --> 03:01:24.679]  The big ultra-rich only pay 1% tax to harass the general public.
[03:01:25.220 --> 03:01:31.785]  Yep, looks like the IRS lied about who those 80,000 new agents would target.
[03:01:33.287 --> 03:01:39.412]  And $80 billion to augment their audit functions.
[03:01:40.669 --> 03:01:46.173]  Absolutely massive increase in persecution.
[03:01:46.193 --> 03:01:51.997]  63% of the new audits targeted taxpayers with incomes of less than $200,000.
[03:01:52.337 --> 03:01:58.741]  Oh my God, the private Federal Reserve lied to us.
[03:02:01.738 --> 03:02:08.543]  Yeah, you think Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and all the rest of them are running around in Europe and the U.S.
[03:02:08.943 --> 03:02:10.504]  having the government target them?
[03:02:10.564 --> 03:02:11.785]  They don't pay taxes.
[03:02:13.887 --> 03:02:16.809]  You read about Hillary Clinton, it never even gives a tip.
[03:02:17.269 --> 03:02:18.390]  She'll be with 20 people.
[03:02:18.770 --> 03:02:20.271]  Somebody else pays for it, no tip.
[03:02:21.392 --> 03:02:26.616]  If they try to put a tip on there, Hillary calls them over and says, don't look me in the eyes, you piece of crap.
[03:02:26.656 --> 03:02:27.256]  Who are you?
[03:02:27.617 --> 03:02:28.577]  I'm getting you fired.
[03:02:29.198 --> 03:02:30.379]  They hate you.
[03:02:31.920 --> 03:02:39.846]  Their strength, which I say is a weakness, is they have absolutely no empathy.
[03:02:41.047 --> 03:02:43.228]  They love what they're doing.
[03:02:44.989 --> 03:02:49.813]  Supreme Court takes up January 6th case that could affect hundreds of prosecutions.
[03:02:50.373 --> 03:03:00.601]  Justices decide whether Enron Air Obstruction Law applies to rioters or people peacefully walking between the velvet ropes.
[03:03:01.482 --> 03:03:05.217]  We're going to be covering all of that more, Maria Z.
[03:03:06.570 --> 03:03:13.014]  He's going to be joining us coming up and then Owen Troyer in 57 minutes from now with The War Room.
[03:03:13.935 --> 03:03:17.137]  Clarence Thomas faces backlash over January 6th case comments.
[03:03:17.777 --> 03:03:18.778]  What a disgrace.
[03:03:18.838 --> 03:03:21.760]  How dare him not say they're all terrorists.
[03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:26.823]  Takeaways from Supreme Court's arguments over obstruction charges using a January 6th rioter.
[03:03:26.883 --> 03:03:35.529]  So they're so scared there's about to be a massive repudiation of the incredible political persecution of January 6th
[03:03:36.772 --> 03:03:51.765]  That is a beta test, ladies and gentlemen, a beta test for all of us to be listed as political enemies of the state and have the system come after you like they've done to Trump and myself and others.
[03:03:51.825 --> 03:03:53.627]  So people ask, how are you handling all this?
[03:03:54.388 --> 03:03:55.469]  I'm a warrior for freedom.
[03:03:55.529 --> 03:04:00.813]  I know they're coming after me because I'm in front of them trying to get to you and you're my family.
[03:04:01.534 --> 03:04:03.135]  If my children aren't safe, you're not safe.
[03:04:03.175 --> 03:04:04.656]  People say, oh, you're so nice to fight for us.
[03:04:05.016 --> 03:04:06.317]  We're all in this together, folks.
[03:04:06.337 --> 03:04:10.999]  No matter where you live, where you are, whether you're a man or a woman, black, white, old, young, doesn't matter.
[03:04:11.419 --> 03:04:13.240]  The globalists want to kill you.
[03:04:13.600 --> 03:04:15.441]  They want to inject you with poison shots.
[03:04:15.481 --> 03:04:16.602]  They want to enslave you.
[03:04:16.862 --> 03:04:18.183]  And all I ask is your prayer.
[03:04:18.843 --> 03:04:26.289]  Your support, your word of mouth, and if you want to get great products, InfoWarsTore.com or DrJonesNaturals.com, our sponsor.
[03:04:26.569 --> 03:04:34.335]  DrJonesNaturals.com or InfoWarsTore.com or call the InfoWarsTore, ask any questions, you name it, Vitamineral Fusion, back in stock.
[03:04:34.915 --> 03:04:38.120]  All right, we're going to break for 60 seconds, and Maria Z is taking over.

[03:06:02.665 --> 03:06:04.286]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:04.326 --> 03:06:11.071]  I'm your guest host, Maria Z, with a powerful, powerful segment and a powerful guest for you today.
[03:06:11.872 --> 03:06:14.694]  There is no doubt that we are living in the last days.
[03:06:14.754 --> 03:06:15.715]  Quickly approaching...
[03:06:17.378 --> 03:06:20.300]  We can see the rise of evil all over the world.
[03:06:20.380 --> 03:06:24.262]  Children are being mutilated under the guise of healthcare.
[03:06:24.802 --> 03:06:27.744]  People are being injected with poison shots.
[03:06:27.864 --> 03:06:34.508]  Just yesterday, I saw an article that Alberta is now updating their guidelines to inject babies.
[03:06:35.149 --> 03:06:37.650]  To inject babies every six months.
[03:06:38.370 --> 03:06:40.872]  They want this poison inside of children.
[03:06:42.008 --> 03:06:47.255]  I'm sure you all saw the stabbing of a wonderful man in Sydney this week, Bishop Marmari.
[03:06:48.957 --> 03:06:54.544]  Christian persecution is on the rise worldwide and we are quickly approaching World War Three.
[03:06:55.706 --> 03:07:13.303]  People want to know the truth and know what is coming and while we can all anticipate the steps of the globalists and many do a fantastic job at analysing what is coming next, there are great people who have gone before us, great men of God, who told us well in advance.
[03:07:14.378 --> 03:07:20.000]  I want to show you briefly a prophecy from a Greek Orthodox saint.
[03:07:20.080 --> 03:07:21.520]  His name is Saint Paisios.
[03:07:21.560 --> 03:07:25.381]  If the team have that link ready to bring it up on the screen.
[03:07:25.802 --> 03:07:27.422]  If not, I'm just going to read it for you.
[03:07:28.342 --> 03:07:36.965]  This prophecy was given in the early 90s from Saint Paisios, a great Orthodox saint, a modern day saint who said,
[03:07:37.748 --> 03:07:44.813]  Now a vaccine has been developed to combat a new disease which will be obligatory and those taking it will be marked.
[03:07:45.474 --> 03:07:54.480]  Later on, anyone who is not marked with the number 666 will not be able to either buy or sell, to get a loan, to get a job and so forth.
[03:07:55.000 --> 03:08:05.488]  My thinking tells me that this is the system through which the Antichrist has chosen to take over the whole world and people who are not part of this system won't be able to find work and so on.
[03:08:06.167 --> 03:08:23.575]  Whether black, white or red, in other words, everyone, he will take over through an economic system that controls the global economy and only those who have accepted the seal, the mark of the number 666, will be able to participate in business dealings.
[03:08:23.615 --> 03:08:28.377]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a prophecy from the early 90s from this saint.
[03:08:29.170 --> 03:08:38.276]  It was a man of God warning us about a vaccine that would lead to a digital economy where you would not be able to buy or sell without your compliance.
[03:08:38.356 --> 03:08:45.001]  Now, I know that we have those warnings in the Bible, but this specifically links to a vaccine.
[03:08:45.061 --> 03:08:53.827]  So these Orthodox saints and prophets over the years, and this is something that I've personally been studying myself in recent times,
[03:08:54.818 --> 03:09:04.425]  A lot more have been extremely accurate when it comes to world events and specifically events surrounding World War Three.
[03:09:04.505 --> 03:09:08.988]  Today we have Father Peter Hears from Orthodox Ethos joining us today.
[03:09:09.068 --> 03:09:17.374]  He's an amazing teacher who you can find on YouTube, you can find it at orthodoxethos.com, also on X at Orthodox Ethos.
[03:09:18.269 --> 03:09:23.273]  And I personally have been incredibly, incredibly blessed by Father Peter's teachings.
[03:09:23.533 --> 03:09:24.654]  He joins us now.
[03:09:24.754 --> 03:09:27.036]  Father Peter, thank you so much for joining us today.
[03:09:27.096 --> 03:09:27.956]  We appreciate you.
[03:09:29.337 --> 03:09:30.398]  Thank you very much, Maria.
[03:09:30.438 --> 03:09:31.219]  Nice to be with you.
[03:09:32.642 --> 03:09:33.303]  It's wonderful.
[03:09:33.943 --> 03:09:36.625]  It's wonderful to see you again since our last interview.
[03:09:36.645 --> 03:09:38.967]  I've been looking forward to our next conversation.
[03:09:39.007 --> 03:09:43.770]  I'm grateful and very honored to be able to introduce you to the InfoWars audience.
[03:09:43.810 --> 03:09:47.732]  For those who aren't familiar with your work, I really want to start.
[03:09:47.773 --> 03:09:52.556]  We have some videos that we want to play for the audience here today, but I would really love to start with you.
[03:09:52.576 --> 03:09:59.620]  If you can just give everyone an overview of what is a prophet, because many false prophets will come.
[03:09:59.760 --> 03:10:01.902]  Many will come even saying, I'm the Christ.
[03:10:02.322 --> 03:10:11.325]  If we can define what a prophet actually is, and then we want to play this video about some of the very accurate Orthodox prophecies that have come over the years.
[03:10:12.285 --> 03:10:13.045]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:10:13.085 --> 03:10:13.666]  Well, St.
[03:10:13.686 --> 03:10:23.368]  Paisios, who you mentioned, is one of the, is probably the last, or one of the last in the long line for 2,000 years, or really, even before Christ, obviously, we have the Old Testament prophets.
[03:10:23.428 --> 03:10:28.070]  From the beginning, even in the garden, there's a prophecy of the defeat of the serpent.
[03:10:28.790 --> 03:10:31.072]  And, of course, we have the revelation of St.
[03:10:31.112 --> 03:10:43.400]  John the Theologian, and we have many prophets throughout the history of the Church, and the key to understanding who is a true prophet and not a false, because there are few true and many false in every generation, is the life.
[03:10:44.425 --> 03:11:05.210]  The Holy Ones, the Friends of God, the eyewitnesses of His divinity, the ones who have been given the gifts of the Holy Spirit, the ones who are pure and holy and see God, these are the criteria which have come down to us, and they follow all those who have come before them.
[03:11:06.010 --> 03:11:07.831]  And there are many prophets
[03:11:08.996 --> 03:11:20.769]  Throughout the church's history, from of course Pentecost, all the apostles were prophets and all those who follow in their life and their teachings are following in the prophetic and having the prophetic gift in one way or another.
[03:11:20.789 --> 03:11:26.636]  The prophetic gift is not just to say the future, but it's to speak the truth to this generation and it's to
[03:11:27.456 --> 03:11:33.841]  To see the things in both the visible and the invisible world through this relationship with God.
[03:11:34.121 --> 03:11:36.262]  We have a great prophet, for instance, St.
[03:11:36.702 --> 03:11:40.165]  Andrew the Fulfill Christ, who lived in the 5th century, unknown to most people.
[03:11:40.685 --> 03:11:56.756]  And he spoke already, then, about a blonde race, referring most likely, as interpreters believe, to the Russians, who will come back down and defeat, as many expect, the Hagarins or the Turks and liberate Constantinople, which is, of course, a major
[03:11:57.537 --> 03:12:03.374]  Concern for all the people in the East the Orthodox in the East we have to remember though that prophecies are not given
[03:12:04.318 --> 03:12:05.239]  Always to be fulfilled.
[03:12:05.299 --> 03:12:06.620]  Sometimes they're given for repentance.
[03:12:06.660 --> 03:12:14.045]  We read in the Gospels, rather the Old Testament with Jonah, who the whole point of the prophecy was to bring repentance.
[03:12:14.705 --> 03:12:18.628]  And also to be watchful and vigilant and to be saved from deceit.
[03:12:19.208 --> 03:12:26.994]  So, the goal of the Lord always is to bring about repentance, to bring about return, and when that doesn't happen, then
[03:12:28.030 --> 03:12:41.215]  We have the fulfillment of the prophecy, and you'll see in this video that we're going to show that there have been many prophecies that are unknown to us that have already been fulfilled, and many more that will be fulfilled very likely shortly.
[03:12:41.415 --> 03:12:50.139]  As one of the contemporary interpreters of many of the prophecies in the Orthodox Church says, the prophecies have now become the headlines, and we're on the verge of the fulfillment of many.
[03:12:51.906 --> 03:12:52.408]  Absolutely.
[03:12:52.428 --> 03:12:59.246]  Well, we want to play that video, team, if you can queue up the prophecy video from the timestamps that I gave, because
[03:13:00.562 --> 03:13:13.433]  As we approach World War Three, and we are very, very quickly approaching World War Three, it is very worthwhile for people to pay attention to the Orthodox prophets because they've gotten it right so many times.
[03:13:14.153 --> 03:13:23.521]  And so the incredible accuracy in this video, you're going to see some of the already fulfilled prophecies and those that are yet to come concerning war specifically.
[03:13:23.961 --> 03:13:25.022]  Let's take a look at that clip.
[03:13:25.669 --> 03:13:32.495]  Anonymous prophecy, unknown to many, found in the library archives of the Holy Monastery of Kudlumosiu on Mount Athos.
[03:13:32.875 --> 03:13:37.459]  And it gives several fulfilled prophecies, and still others that are unfulfilled.
[03:13:38.180 --> 03:13:52.452]  Among the fulfilled, it writes of a great European war, the defeat of Germans, and the catastrophe of Russia for Russia and Austria, the result of World War I. The defeat of the Turks by the Greeks, but then the reinforcement of Turks,
[03:13:53.092 --> 03:13:59.196]  By the Western nations, the defeat of the Greeks by the Haggars in 1923, with the support of the West.
[03:13:59.556 --> 03:14:02.237]  Slaughter of Orthodox peoples in Smyrna and Kost.
[03:14:02.918 --> 03:14:05.099]  The New European War, World War II.
[03:14:05.579 --> 03:14:07.680]  Defeat of the French by the Germans in 1940.
[03:14:07.861 --> 03:14:14.244]  The revolt in India and the end of the British Empire, all fulfilled.
[03:14:15.025 --> 03:14:18.547]  And there are many unfulfilled, among which are the following.
[03:14:19.739 --> 03:14:29.743]  Victory of the Orthodox peoples and general defeat of the Turks by the Orthodox Christians, possibly Russia coming down and taking over Constantinople as prophesied elsewhere.
[03:14:30.624 --> 03:14:37.987]  The world being in anxiety and there being general despair on the earth possibly from the decision to use nuclear warfare.
[03:14:39.076 --> 03:14:41.078]  The battle of seven states in Constantinople.
[03:14:41.238 --> 03:14:42.980]  Slaughter for three days and nights.
[03:14:43.581 --> 03:14:45.783]  Victory of the largest state over six states.
[03:14:45.924 --> 03:14:49.768]  But then, an alliance of the six states over the seventh.
[03:14:50.048 --> 03:14:50.889]  Slaughter again.
[03:14:50.909 --> 03:14:56.115]  And in this case, so much blood will flow in Constantinople, according to St.
[03:14:56.135 --> 03:15:00.360]  Cosmas of Toulouse, that a three-and-a-half-year-old calf will float in it.
[03:15:01.536 --> 03:15:07.939]  And then cessation of a war by an angel and delivery of the city to the Orthodox Romii.
[03:15:08.799 --> 03:15:18.784]  The interpreter of these and other prophecies and adding to them is the great Saint Cosmas Aetolos, a monk of Manathos, great missionary during the Ottoman period.
[03:15:19.524 --> 03:15:45.702]  Whose prophecies made a hundred or more years before the advent of technology speak of the coming Amazing technology that came to the world and he says you will see in the field a carriage without horses running faster than a rabbit The time will come when the earth will be girded by a thread probably referring to electrical power or the internet a time will come when people will speak from one distant place to another as though they were in adjoining rooms
[03:15:50.204 --> 03:16:07.574]  So that is just a picture, a glimpse of all of the fulfilled prophecies and those that are yet to come.
[03:16:07.694 --> 03:16:15.338]  And so, Father, here's, I guess, in the context of some of the threats that we are facing today in terms of what's happening in the Middle East, we have
[03:16:16.058 --> 03:16:24.826]  Sadly, some evangelical leaders in the United States, Pastor John Hagee, calling for war with Iran, basically.
[03:16:24.907 --> 03:16:28.930]  It's incredibly disturbing to see Christians speaking in this manner.
[03:16:28.950 --> 03:16:34.716]  And so I'd really love to hear from you in the context of what's happening today.
[03:16:35.116 --> 03:16:36.157]  What can we expect?
[03:16:37.981 --> 03:16:43.963]  Well, there are many more prophecies that have been uttered by this anonymous prophet and also St.
[03:16:43.983 --> 03:16:45.324]  Cosmas of Toulouse and St.
[03:16:45.364 --> 03:16:50.086]  Paisios and others who are still, who are just recently reposed or still living, actually.
[03:16:50.606 --> 03:17:03.771]  So, one of the things that the signs of the coming war will be when they will see a thousand great fleet in the White Sea or around Constantinople, and that will be the beginning of the great war that was mentioned earlier.
[03:17:04.466 --> 03:17:07.568]  And there's prophesied, and this has been repeated by St.
[03:17:07.608 --> 03:17:20.736]  Paisios of the Holy Mountain, that one-third will be killed, one-third will be baptized, and one-third will go into the depths of Turkey when this massive world war is triggered.
[03:17:20.856 --> 03:17:29.342]  And there's a prophecy recently commemorated by Metropolitan Neophytos which says,
[03:17:30.106 --> 03:17:47.358]  That one day, this was uttered years ago, 20 years ago, by an ascetic in Crete, Theodore, an ascetic in Crete, he says, one day you'll be sipping coffee, you will hear the news that the Israelis have hit the nuclear program of Persia, that will be when the major worldwide events will start.
[03:17:47.799 --> 03:17:56.725]  At the same time, another sign, either shortly before or after, Erdogan, the head of Turkey, will fall, and this will be the sign of the great events
[03:17:57.885 --> 03:17:58.446]  We're good to go.
[03:18:15.095 --> 03:18:29.698]  There will be great destruction on the coasts of America, and that all of these events and others are going to come about because of the utter unrepentance, not just the sin of mankind today.
[03:18:30.818 --> 03:18:44.180]  And one great Eldress that just reposed a few years ago says that the following, people, the people who provoke this war, those who have led humanity by way of mass abortions, unnatural acts,
[03:18:45.163 --> 03:18:59.048]  That within and outside of marriage, Satanism and the occult, the witchcraft, and all of that which is spread through the internet, that such souls are no longer, you cannot find souls that are not corrupted.
[03:18:59.468 --> 03:19:09.652]  She says these are leading humanity into this war, and the worst is that we, not that we sin and we follow the lead, but that we do not repent, we refuse to repent.
[03:19:10.439 --> 03:19:18.889]  Uh, and so we rather, she says, are proud of our sin and we parade about and do what we, uh, and teach about it.
[03:19:19.489 --> 03:19:30.762]  Uh, and so, uh, all of these signs that are given by these contemporary saints, um, are given for repentance, but unfortunately it's said in many places that there is no repentance today.
[03:19:30.902 --> 03:19:32.403]  And that's why the war is coming.
[03:19:32.903 --> 03:19:38.548]  And indeed, there's an appearance of a great saint to a contemporary elder, St.
[03:19:38.588 --> 03:19:42.571]  Iakovos, and he begged, why must this take place?
[03:19:43.011 --> 03:19:49.956]  And he said, there's no other way to save humanity, because humanity is quickly going wholesale into sin.
[03:19:50.797 --> 03:19:57.942]  And so, in fact, even with a massive war that seems to be imminent, it is always
[03:19:58.951 --> 03:20:03.695]  The desire of God for our repentance and our return and our communion with Him.
[03:20:04.856 --> 03:20:10.140]  It also should be noted that the prophecies talk about these wars that are coming.
[03:20:10.320 --> 03:20:12.381]  There'll be two wars, two periods of wars.
[03:20:12.862 --> 03:20:21.368]  Very clearly, both Saint Cosmas and Saint Paisios talk about six months of war between Russia and the NATO states.
[03:20:22.429 --> 03:20:25.852]  A break or stop in war for six months, a stalemate.
[03:20:26.602 --> 03:20:42.633]  And Russia not going back from its gains, and then the massive World War III, which will bring about the massive loss of some speculate 200 million lives during this massive conflict.
[03:20:43.814 --> 03:20:47.477]  All of this has been prophesied and much more, with much detail.
[03:20:48.462 --> 03:20:48.762]  By the
[03:21:09.495 --> 03:21:16.702]  We split into three pieces, and some will be given to the Kurds, some to the Armenians, and then the rest to the Greeks.
[03:21:17.663 --> 03:21:21.587]  And so, this is all connected with what we're seeing going on in the Middle East right now.
[03:21:22.488 --> 03:21:31.757]  That's the trigger, it'll spread, it'll connect Russia with the Middle East, and the place of the mass conflict will be in the midst of these two, which is Turkey.
[03:21:33.736 --> 03:21:42.367]  I actually wanted to talk about... We could go on with many other prophecies, but I don't want to get too distracted from the... Of course, absolutely.
[03:21:44.213 --> 03:21:48.054]  Of course, I want to bring up the other clip that I've sent the team.
[03:21:48.074 --> 03:22:01.999]  Tim, if you can play that on a lower volume so that I can actually read out the translation for the radio listeners, because it's very, very important for people to understand who is the real enemy.
[03:22:02.059 --> 03:22:05.620]  The media is lying about who the real enemy is.
[03:22:06.200 --> 03:22:08.701]  And really, our enemy is not our fellow man.
[03:22:08.741 --> 03:22:10.861]  It is those who are orchestrating these things.
[03:22:11.462 --> 03:22:12.562]  So let's cue up that video.
[03:22:16.445 --> 03:22:18.066]  OK, the team are telling me they don't have it.
[03:22:18.266 --> 03:22:19.586]  I sent it through last night.
[03:22:19.606 --> 03:22:22.007]  I might send it back over again over the break.
[03:22:22.047 --> 03:22:22.588]  That's OK.
[03:22:23.448 --> 03:22:25.169]  And so, all right.
[03:22:25.229 --> 03:22:32.551]  Well, before we go into that particular topic, could you talk a little bit about the significance of Turkey?
[03:22:32.572 --> 03:22:38.534]  And what do you think, in light of the prophecies, how will Turkey's involvement happen here?
[03:22:40.959 --> 03:23:08.008]  Well, the key sign of the disintegration of Turkey will be the end of Erdogan, according to the prophecies, and the new leadership will be inclined toward the West, and they will do the bidding of the West, and one of that, the key thing that will happen was they will close the straits, and not allow the Russian military to pass, to go to the Middle East, where a lot of their interests will be at stake.
[03:23:09.117 --> 03:23:18.446]  And that will happen during a short war between Turkey and Greece, because that's a prerequisite for the straits to be shut.
[03:23:18.966 --> 03:23:22.950]  There must be a warfare state going on.
[03:23:23.410 --> 03:23:25.993]  Otherwise, they're not justified by international law.
[03:23:26.093 --> 03:23:34.120]  So the prophecies are that Turkey will strike Greece over the disputed six miles between the two countries.
[03:23:35.023 --> 03:23:39.086]  And they have long had this dispute, well-known dispute going back decades and decades.
[03:23:39.926 --> 03:23:49.473]  And they will get the nod for this because ultimately it will be in the best interest of NATO to shut the straits and keep Russia out.
[03:23:50.408 --> 03:23:50.869]  I think?
[03:24:06.088 --> 03:24:07.169]  And he was saying these things.
[03:24:07.649 --> 03:24:09.529]  Now you can see them literally in front of us.
[03:24:10.430 --> 03:24:14.852]  Erdogan's party has largely lost power in the last elections.
[03:24:14.992 --> 03:24:16.672]  He has said he's going to step down.
[03:24:17.233 --> 03:24:28.697]  And now we're on the verge of possibly the attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, which is also set as a sign to provoke the larger war.
[03:24:29.217 --> 03:24:35.200]  So Turkey is, according to the prophecies, at the center of all the development going forward.
[03:24:36.604 --> 03:24:40.107]  Well, I think that's important because it's not even on anyone's radar yet.
[03:24:40.187 --> 03:24:48.373]  Most people are focusing on Russia, Ukraine, what's happening with NATO, the Middle East as well, Israel, and the horrors happening in Gaza.
[03:24:49.053 --> 03:24:55.598]  And so, you know, the other players, I guess, that are going to be involved certainly aren't on anyone's radar.
[03:24:56.779 --> 03:25:02.203]  Father Peter, what have the prophecies said about the Israel region?
[03:25:04.460 --> 03:25:17.446]  Well, it says that there will be, there's actually a prophecy that says that they will level Palestine, which I think one could say is happening right now with Gaza, and the tomb will be the Dead Sea.
[03:25:17.947 --> 03:25:20.168]  What exactly that means is hard to see.
[03:25:20.228 --> 03:25:24.710]  Many times we have to realize that prophecies are interpreted as they're happening.
[03:25:25.210 --> 03:25:27.671]  It's difficult to interpret the prophecies beforehand.
[03:25:27.691 --> 03:25:28.912]  There's a lot of speculation.
[03:25:30.239 --> 03:25:39.424]  But as events come and signs are given, and there are signs always given, and they're always given again for our repentance.
[03:25:39.464 --> 03:25:47.709]  But the signs come, people are hardened in their sin, they don't want to listen, they don't believe, they don't have fear of God, and they continue on.
[03:25:48.329 --> 03:25:57.274]  So the sign for Israel will be that it will be the epicenter of much of this war.
[03:25:58.135 --> 03:26:00.676]  Russia will, according to prophecies, be victorious.
[03:26:00.716 --> 03:26:05.737]  They will defeat Turkey, with massive losses to Turkey.
[03:26:06.097 --> 03:26:10.018]  And they will continue all the way down to the boundaries of Israel.
[03:26:11.418 --> 03:26:17.200]  And that will be the end of the first stage of the war, the second six months.
[03:26:18.217 --> 03:26:33.182]  We'll be a stalemate and the Western powers telling Russia to retreat and go back and Russia refusing and then that will be the beginning of the massive war which hundreds of millions of people are expected according to prophecies to perish.
[03:26:34.943 --> 03:26:47.587]  It is also prophesied by a great elder in America, Elder Ephraim, who just reposed on the eve of the COVID insanity.
[03:26:48.659 --> 03:26:50.341]  He had many things to say.
[03:26:50.361 --> 03:26:56.646]  He said that within a few years after my repose, the great events that have been prophesied will come about.
[03:26:57.527 --> 03:27:05.534]  That the United States, among other countries, will pay the price of many, many years of sin.
[03:27:06.757 --> 03:27:10.499]  That will come back to to they will pay the price for many years of sin.
[03:27:10.539 --> 03:27:13.781]  And as we said earlier, there's many prophecies about America.
[03:27:13.901 --> 03:27:16.643]  One of the things that was said by St.
[03:27:16.683 --> 03:27:21.065]  Basil of Capsule, Elder Basil of Capsule Caliber who reposed just about 15 years ago.
[03:27:22.134 --> 03:27:25.755]  America will be broken into pieces, according to his prophecy.
[03:27:25.955 --> 03:27:33.577]  And another saint, a Russian saint, almost a hundred years ago said, America, which fed the entire world, will come unto starvation.
[03:27:34.117 --> 03:27:36.598]  And that was said over a hundred years ago.
[03:27:38.698 --> 03:27:42.059]  In interpreting some of these prophecies, the great
[03:27:43.044 --> 03:27:53.951]  Contemporary interpreter of these, Metropolitan Neophytos of Morphu, who I think the video you're going to play is showing him talking in a recent interview with a Russian news agency.
[03:27:54.751 --> 03:27:59.575]  He interprets this happening during the great conflict between Russia and America, which is coming.
[03:27:59.815 --> 03:28:09.741]  And indeed, he says that there will be massive tsunamis that will hit the coast of America, or maybe an earthquake, other people believe, on the West Coast.
[03:28:10.261 --> 03:28:11.202]  Again, all these things
[03:28:12.140 --> 03:28:12.400]  I think?
[03:28:31.877 --> 03:28:32.798]  We do not speculate.
[03:28:33.058 --> 03:28:35.100]  Father Peter, we have to go to break.
[03:28:35.501 --> 03:28:36.402]  You're absolutely right.
[03:28:36.422 --> 03:28:37.303]  These are men of God.
[03:28:37.363 --> 03:28:38.424]  It's not speculation.
[03:28:38.484 --> 03:28:44.029]  We have the proof that they've been accurate so many times in history.
[03:28:44.470 --> 03:28:49.475]  After the break, we're going to go back to that video and further commentary from Father Peter.
[03:28:49.515 --> 03:28:52.498]  He is Don't Go Anywhere, OrthodoxEthos.com.
[03:28:52.518 --> 03:28:53.179]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:56.698 --> 03:29:01.780]  Survival Shield X3, now back and better than ever with a whopping 40% discount.
[03:29:02.160 --> 03:29:06.762]  It's your ticket to a healthier you, powered by the might of activated triiodine.

[03:30:01.826 --> 03:30:02.226]  I need that.
[03:30:02.606 --> 03:30:03.647]  It's your prayer that's doing it.
[03:30:03.948 --> 03:30:04.829]  That's why this surfaced.
[03:30:04.849 --> 03:30:05.729]  That's why this happened.
[03:30:05.749 --> 03:30:14.717]  I need the prayer that I need you to take the articles, the videos, the posts we make at Real Alex Jones, recopy them, share them, post them yourself, do whatever.

[03:30:46.317 --> 03:31:00.189]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[03:31:00.570 --> 03:31:07.616]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of, is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[03:31:07.776 --> 03:31:09.798]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[03:31:09.958 --> 03:31:11.019]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[03:31:11.039 --> 03:31:11.740]  He loved the idea.
[03:31:12.080 --> 03:31:15.585]  What would you call the debates and discussions about a pro-human future?
[03:31:15.625 --> 03:31:16.506]  Just Team Humanity?
[03:31:16.566 --> 03:31:17.447]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[03:31:17.587 --> 03:31:18.028]  Absolutely.

[03:31:19.810 --> 03:31:23.274]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family, standing against the globalists.
[03:31:23.494 --> 03:31:30.924]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[03:31:31.184 --> 03:31:42.910]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[03:31:43.190 --> 03:31:44.511]  We're told humans are the problem.
[03:31:44.551 --> 03:31:45.531]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[03:31:45.812 --> 03:31:50.074]  We're told all this garbage, so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[03:31:50.374 --> 03:31:51.094]  We're not going to do that.
[03:31:51.354 --> 03:31:55.977]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at InfoWarsTore.com, and I thank you all for your support.

[03:32:48.504 --> 03:32:56.387]  So go to ImpulseWarsTore.com and find out what Vitamin Mineral Fusion can do for you.
[03:32:58.128 --> 03:33:04.011]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:12.139 --> 03:33:12.699]  Welcome back.
[03:33:12.780 --> 03:33:16.662]  We are here with Father Peter Hears from Orthodox Ethos.
[03:33:16.702 --> 03:33:20.425]  You can find his work at orthodoxethos.com.
[03:33:20.905 --> 03:33:24.948]  Also, I encourage everyone to subscribe to the Orthodox Ethos YouTube channel.
[03:33:25.008 --> 03:33:29.871]  I'm telling you guys, this channel has blessed me more than words can describe.
[03:33:29.891 --> 03:33:32.773]  And Father Peter Hears' teachings have been amazing.
[03:33:32.813 --> 03:33:39.398]  I've been recommending the channel to many, many people and they've all agreed, wow, this is next level teaching.
[03:33:40.659 --> 03:33:46.124]  It really doesn't compare to much these days at all.
[03:33:46.725 --> 03:33:52.871]  You can also follow Orthodox Ethos on X. Before the break, we spoke about a video that we wanted to play.
[03:33:52.991 --> 03:34:00.559]  If the team can queue that up right now, I'm going to translate it for you for the radio listeners who can't see the words up on screen.
[03:34:02.432 --> 03:34:07.713]  That will be terribly destructive and in the end lead to world war.
[03:34:07.813 --> 03:34:12.434]  This started as we said in Syria, Ukraine and Israel.
[03:34:12.694 --> 03:34:23.817]  After the Jews strike against Iran's nuclear program, then both China and Russia will be forced to react.
[03:34:24.157 --> 03:34:26.257]  The prophecies of the saints
[03:34:30.280 --> 03:34:41.603]  Say this and note, not only the Greek saints, the Russian, Romanian, Serbian saints say this.
[03:34:43.683 --> 03:34:46.924]  They all say that countries will use nuclear weapons.
[03:34:46.964 --> 03:34:48.644]  Do you know what the amazing thing is?
[03:34:49.044 --> 03:34:50.905]  Putin and China don't want that.
[03:34:52.445 --> 03:34:54.886]  The New World Order wants it very, very much.
[03:34:57.985 --> 03:34:59.706]  Hey, they pushed them to do this.
[03:35:00.686 --> 03:35:04.387]  Putin and China are pressured to do it.
[03:35:06.588 --> 03:35:09.189]  So that is a fascinating video.
[03:35:09.329 --> 03:35:11.270]  Father Peter Hears is here with us.
[03:35:11.870 --> 03:35:18.552]  Could you please tell us a little bit more about who that man was, Father Peter, and a little bit more about that prophecy?
[03:35:19.232 --> 03:35:22.553]  So that is Metropolitan Neophytos of Morphou.
[03:35:22.573 --> 03:35:27.454]  He is a disciple and a close confidant of several contemporary Orthodox Saints.
[03:35:27.494 --> 03:35:31.495]  Saint Paisios, Saint Porphyrios, Saint Iakovos, Saint Eumenios.
[03:35:32.136 --> 03:35:40.838]  And he's labored all for the last 20 years to collect all of the prophecies that came down to us from these Saints and others throughout history.
[03:35:41.018 --> 03:35:47.960]  And he is constantly teaching and telling the world what the Orthodox Saints have to say about the events that are coming.
[03:35:48.784 --> 03:35:53.207]  And he's extremely beloved by the whole Orthodox Church today.
[03:35:53.687 --> 03:35:57.069]  His videos are translated in many, many languages all around the world.
[03:35:57.129 --> 03:36:00.671]  He's interviewed, as you saw there, by many people throughout the Orthodox world.
[03:36:00.771 --> 03:36:04.934]  Russian agencies, news agencies, have come down many times to interview him.
[03:36:05.294 --> 03:36:06.134]  He's very bold.
[03:36:06.315 --> 03:36:08.456]  He stood against all of the COVID insanity.
[03:36:08.896 --> 03:36:14.519]  He stands against all of the compromises with the West and the New World Order.
[03:36:14.539 --> 03:36:16.140]  He's constantly speaking about the New World Order.
[03:36:16.160 --> 03:36:16.981]  It's a very rare
[03:36:17.794 --> 03:36:19.776]  An important figure in the Orthodox Church.
[03:36:20.216 --> 03:36:25.039]  Everyone should go and watch his videos, find his videos on YouTube, watch what he has to say.
[03:36:26.220 --> 03:36:31.984]  And he is, you know, the most authentic, one of the most authentic voices in the Orthodox Church today.
[03:36:32.004 --> 03:36:34.866]  It doesn't get any more authentic from a spiritual standpoint.
[03:36:36.087 --> 03:36:38.329]  Could you please give his name for everyone again?
[03:36:38.349 --> 03:36:40.851]  It may be a little bit difficult for some to spell.
[03:36:41.031 --> 03:36:45.434]  Yes, Metropolitan is the term of Bishop, in other words, Bishop Neophytos.
[03:36:46.132 --> 03:36:49.895]  And usually it's spelled N-E-O-P-H-Y-T-O-S.
[03:36:50.616 --> 03:36:52.838]  And he's in Morphu of Cyprus.
[03:36:52.978 --> 03:36:54.519]  So he's in the Church of Cyprus.
[03:36:54.539 --> 03:37:01.705]  He's on the border there where Cyprus was divided into two during the Turkish invasion.
[03:37:02.406 --> 03:37:06.349]  And he's very well accessible, even in English.
[03:37:06.389 --> 03:37:08.631]  Many things translated in YouTube videos.
[03:37:09.571 --> 03:37:19.236]  This is just a very small snippet of many, many interviews and talks that he's given that are filled with wisdom, insight into what's happening right now and what's coming.
[03:37:19.356 --> 03:37:26.760]  And he's been saying this for a decade or more, all of these things that we're now living, especially with developments in the Middle East.
[03:37:26.800 --> 03:37:28.921]  He's been talking about them for as long as I can remember.
[03:37:30.862 --> 03:37:43.290]  A lot of people are under the impression that it'll sort of stay in the Middle East and it's not going to escalate to nuclear war, but that is sadly not what the prophets have taught us.
[03:37:44.871 --> 03:37:50.055]  But, Father Peter, I want to ask you, the possibility still exists for repentance.
[03:37:50.115 --> 03:37:54.558]  So talk to us about the outcome versus if the world repents of their sin.
[03:37:55.697 --> 03:38:09.718]  Well, there is a lot of good news, actually, from Metropolitan Theophilus and other great contemporary saints, because they do not see this as an imminent ascent to the last days, to the prophesied days in Revelation, to the Antichrist.
[03:38:10.879 --> 03:38:30.993]  What has been prophesied by these saints, Saint Porphyrios, Saint Paisios, Elder Ephraim of America and Metropolitan Neophilus and others, is that in fact, after this terrible war, there will be a restoration in many ways of the Christian witness, the Orthodox Church and its witness in the world.
[03:38:31.073 --> 03:38:39.299]  There will be peace for decades and there will be a total renaissance and resurgence of the Christian message and Christian teaching, the Orthodox Christian
[03:38:39.799 --> 03:38:39.979]  I think?
[03:38:59.400 --> 03:38:59.580]  I think?
[03:39:14.315 --> 03:39:16.817]  The Saints that are existing and they've always been few.
[03:39:17.517 --> 03:39:24.863]  The prophets were killed by the Jews themselves and the martyrs throughout church history.
[03:39:25.363 --> 03:39:34.390]  The path of the truth in the world is one of persecution and many times there's few voices left to speak the truth and yet the truth is
[03:39:35.270 --> 03:39:43.214]  A majority, even in the midst of a total apparent rout of the enemy of salvation.
[03:39:43.274 --> 03:39:46.336]  So, that's the good news.
[03:39:46.456 --> 03:39:50.298]  But we do have this immediate path in front of us.
[03:39:50.778 --> 03:39:53.500]  And the most important thing is to prepare.
[03:39:53.680 --> 03:39:54.500]  And how do we prepare?
[03:39:54.520 --> 03:39:55.981]  Through repentance.
[03:39:56.001 --> 03:39:58.242]  Which means return to God.
[03:39:58.462 --> 03:40:01.864]  Which means coming back to His commandments and His teachings and His way.
[03:40:02.564 --> 03:40:03.404]  We're good to go!
[03:40:30.371 --> 03:40:30.871]  We're good to go!
[03:41:00.402 --> 03:41:02.623]  That there will be an intervention of God in history.
[03:41:02.883 --> 03:41:04.663]  And many people will think it's the second coming.
[03:41:05.083 --> 03:41:09.784]  But it will in fact be an intervention for the sake of His creation.
[03:41:10.285 --> 03:41:14.926]  And to give them one last opportunity to repent.
[03:41:15.266 --> 03:41:17.486]  And many people to hear the gospel across the world.
[03:41:17.866 --> 03:41:21.948]  It has not been preached to the four corners of the world according to the saints.
[03:41:22.348 --> 03:41:23.548]  And there's still work to be done.
[03:41:24.168 --> 03:41:41.817]  And so, the task is very clear for those who seek the truth, and that is to repent personally, and to seek out the Holy Ones, and then to speak the truth to our generation, which is what people like Metropolitan Neophytos are doing.
[03:41:41.857 --> 03:41:50.161]  They're doing amazing work, and we're translating everything we can, including his books and his writings into English for people to learn more.
[03:41:51.636 --> 03:41:59.560]  We'll bring up, at the end of the next segment, we're going to bring up the Uncut Mountain Press website, show people where they can get some of those books.
[03:42:00.140 --> 03:42:01.961]  So we'll do that in the next segment.
[03:42:01.981 --> 03:42:08.344]  But I really want to talk with you, Father Peter, about the events in Israel at the moment.
[03:42:08.384 --> 03:42:12.586]  We're getting word that Israel is getting ready to sacrifice a red heifer.
[03:42:12.626 --> 03:42:16.467]  They believe that this is going to purify the world of sin.
[03:42:16.507 --> 03:42:19.609]  Of course, this is a grave heresy, a grave error.
[03:42:20.009 --> 03:42:20.149]  I think.
[03:42:39.273 --> 03:42:49.460]  For the return of Jesus, that we require a third temple to be built and a cow to be sacrificed and, you know, in order for Jesus to return and they're pushing it along.
[03:42:49.540 --> 03:42:54.503]  So after the break we want to talk about that and the truth about Jesus' return.
[03:42:54.523 --> 03:42:55.744]  Don't go anywhere, we'll be right back.
[03:42:56.952 --> 03:42:58.374]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is back.

[03:46:58.265 --> 03:47:04.168]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:12.449 --> 03:47:16.312]  Well, this is our last segment with Father Peter Kears here today.
[03:47:16.372 --> 03:47:29.983]  I'm sure we'll have him on again, but right before the break, I asked him about the current events in Israel, the fact that we're getting word that there's plans to sacrifice a red heifer, that this is, the Jews believe this is going to purify the world of our sin.
[03:47:30.583 --> 03:47:39.870]  Of course, Jesus has already purified the world of our sin, and we need to believe in Him and His sacrifice in order to be with the Father.
[03:47:39.890 --> 03:47:41.632]  That is the only way to the Father.
[03:47:42.272 --> 03:47:46.437]  And, of course, loving the Jewish people is telling them this.
[03:47:47.218 --> 03:48:03.774]  If we want to see the world come to salvation, we need to share the message of Jesus, the truth about the Messiah who already came, died and was raised on the third day, and we will be with the Lord forever if we believe and live the life according to what he has prescribed.
[03:48:04.811 --> 03:48:23.566]  There are people, there are people, Father Peter, particularly in the evangelical circles, who think that it's somehow a requirement for Jesus to return, that this is going to spur his return, this sacrifice of this cow in Israel, this building of the temple, the altar, and that these are good signs.
[03:48:24.006 --> 03:48:25.107]  Could you speak to that, please?
[03:48:27.242 --> 03:48:30.486]  Well, there's a number of ways we could talk about this and examine it.
[03:48:30.746 --> 03:48:41.219]  First, before we even get into the topic, the essence of their case, the idea that we would do evil, do bad things, support things that are
[03:48:42.091 --> 03:48:49.094]  Not true in order for something good to come about is clearly rejected in Holy Scripture and by the Apostle Paul.
[03:48:49.474 --> 03:48:58.358]  And there is also a patristic axiom that's given to us for 2000 years by the Church Fathers, which says you can't do a good thing in a bad way.
[03:48:59.158 --> 03:49:04.140]  And so before you even examine whether they're right that we need to somehow help
[03:49:05.412 --> 03:49:12.997]  Israel rebuild the temple so that the Antichrist can come and rule from Jerusalem in the temple, which is prophesied.
[03:49:13.238 --> 03:49:13.858]  That is true.
[03:49:13.918 --> 03:49:19.842]  There's prophecies and it's clear that that's expected to happen in the days of Antichrist.
[03:49:20.282 --> 03:49:26.947]  The idea that we would help that as Christians is delusional, to say the least, and it's not going to be blessed by God.
[03:49:27.587 --> 03:49:27.847]  Yeah.
[03:49:43.982 --> 03:49:44.923]  The false messiah.
[03:49:45.023 --> 03:49:48.786]  It's just unbelievable that there are Christians who are teaching this and pushing this.
[03:49:49.386 --> 03:49:54.890]  Clearly an innovation and departure from the inheritance of the church for 2,000 years.
[03:49:55.190 --> 03:50:02.416]  This whole theology, this pensationalism, the idea of the rapture, all of this is very recent in church history.
[03:50:02.456 --> 03:50:08.440]  We're talking 150 years has no relation to the previous 1,800 years of church teaching.
[03:50:09.521 --> 03:50:13.164]  And just on that alone, we should be rejected out of hand because
[03:50:14.111 --> 03:50:25.738]  The Apostle Paul and the teachers of the Church passed down throughout the ages the experience and the teaching of that experience from that experience from age to age, generation to generation.
[03:50:25.858 --> 03:50:31.102]  If it's never been taught and it's been rejected, it certainly should not be followed today.
[03:50:31.202 --> 03:50:42.829]  So, they are helping, of course, bring about catastrophe in the Middle East because of their delusional theology and their delusional spiritual approach to the whole topic, unfortunately.
[03:50:44.212 --> 03:50:54.674]  Well, this is to me, and correct me if I'm wrong, a sign of the great apostasy, the great falling away, a movement towards incorrect teaching, and in fact, helping the Antichrist along.
[03:50:54.714 --> 03:50:58.295]  I mean, this is, I've never seen something so bizarre in my life.
[03:51:00.596 --> 03:51:03.456]  Well, I don't think they understand the nature of the Antichrist.
[03:51:03.656 --> 03:51:06.637]  I think they think very superficially and politically.
[03:51:07.595 --> 03:51:19.318]  And they think that they have more, maybe, authority and power and knowledge than the many, many holy men that have taught before them.
[03:51:19.398 --> 03:51:20.218]  And that's the problem.
[03:51:20.258 --> 03:51:22.179]  The pride goeth before the fall.
[03:51:22.539 --> 03:51:29.841]  And the ignorance and rejection of the entire inheritance of the apostolic teaching is what brings them into this delusion.
[03:51:29.941 --> 03:51:33.622]  So, God forbid that Christians would support the
[03:51:34.322 --> 03:51:42.448]  That's what's common throughout the church's history is that those who wrote it and those who interpret it have the same experience that is of the divine energy, the divine grace of God.
[03:51:57.539 --> 03:51:57.800]  Thank you!
[03:52:18.819 --> 03:52:22.360]  And it's a part of the actual whole end times.
[03:52:22.760 --> 03:52:31.022]  Really, their delusion and their pushing this is a sign of the times that we are increasingly in the last days of apostasy.
[03:52:32.723 --> 03:52:46.526]  Well, Father Peter, we've got about five minutes remaining here, so I'd really love for you to spend that time just talking to people about what we should be doing in these days, and the One True Church, and what repentance actually is.
[03:52:48.183 --> 03:53:03.991]  So all of the prophecies and all of the events are all geared toward our repentance as we said, which means a return, which means we as Christians all around the world need a return to the inheritance of the apostolic tradition which has been preserved and guarded within the Orthodox Church.
[03:53:05.569 --> 03:53:07.871]  Means repentance is not remorse.
[03:53:08.191 --> 03:53:10.013]  It's not a bad feeling.
[03:53:10.133 --> 03:53:14.316]  It's not simply an intellectual change.
[03:53:14.536 --> 03:53:18.059]  It's a change of orientation, a spiritual orientation, and it's a return
[03:53:23.297 --> 03:53:34.282]  So, that's what we should be about, and that means coming back in all different ways that we've apostatized, especially in the West, from the true Gospel which has been handed down to us.
[03:53:34.342 --> 03:53:38.745]  I mean, we are living through a thousand years of apostasy.
[03:53:38.785 --> 03:53:41.626]  This is the fruit of a thousand years of apostasy in the West.
[03:53:42.166 --> 03:53:42.446]  Thank you.
[03:54:00.845 --> 03:54:17.679]  Change the general direction of the entire trajectory of the West and the world today, but we can change our own allegiances and turn away from those things which are clearly innovations, clearly departures, clearly not given by God.
[03:54:18.120 --> 03:54:28.508]  All the various teachings which are like, you know, human ideas that are generated but do not lead us to union with God.
[03:54:29.469 --> 03:54:37.277]  That's one general way to talk about it, but in particular these prophecies are given for us to repent from the very grievous
[03:54:38.294 --> 03:54:38.755]  We're good to go.
[03:55:01.913 --> 03:55:02.814]  Thank you.
[03:55:17.725 --> 03:55:26.170]  Because of those gross sins, which, you know, if you want to analyze it just in one word, it's desacralization on many levels.
[03:55:26.590 --> 03:55:28.211]  It's blasphemy on many levels.
[03:55:28.611 --> 03:55:38.397]  It's taking the holiness of marriage and blaspheming and desacralizing from both in and before marriage, the destruction of purity in the youth.
[03:55:38.917 --> 03:55:44.040]  All of these things are abhorrent to God and have been for thousands of years.
[03:55:45.001 --> 03:55:57.491]  The turning away from the clear teachings and scriptures, the arrogance, all of this that which we see, of course, being led, as you know, this Galatea, this recent saying said, by the people who are pushing it.
[03:55:57.651 --> 03:56:06.338]  Of course, the metropolitan offices, it's the new world order elite that is leading the way, but so many people are following as well.
[03:56:07.399 --> 03:56:11.803]  And so, let's first and foremost back away from that which is provoking the wrath of
[03:56:12.647 --> 03:56:13.188]  I think?
[03:56:20.709 --> 03:56:27.313]  Toward Christ in His fullness and come back to the teachings that have been passed down in the Orthodox Church, which had never been corrupted.
[03:56:27.753 --> 03:56:35.578]  And it's apparent in the lives of these prophets and these saints in our day, that this is the same gospel, the same power and authority for 2,000 years.
[03:56:36.458 --> 03:56:48.966]  That's one more witness and one more reason why God is allowing these prophecies to become known to people all around the world through our shows, but mainly through Metropolitan Theophilus and others, is precisely to witness to the truth for their salvation.
[03:56:49.446 --> 03:56:51.651]  Not just to tell us, oh this is coming.
[03:56:52.532 --> 03:56:53.514]  Be aware.
[03:56:53.995 --> 03:56:59.184]  But all of it is meant to bring us all to repentance and return to the gospel.
[03:57:00.026 --> 03:57:01.970]  The unadulterated gospel.
[03:57:03.500 --> 03:57:10.965]  God bless InfoWars and God bless you, Father Peter, for bringing this to so many people watching today.
[03:57:11.046 --> 03:57:15.429]  We have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, just online alone.
[03:57:15.449 --> 03:57:21.213]  I want to really bring up, quickly bring up Uncut Mountain Press, team, if you can bring that link up.
[03:57:21.573 --> 03:57:24.015]  That is uncutmountainpress.com.

[03:57:28.077 --> 03:57:30.038]  There is nothing more frustrating to me
[03:57:51.209 --> 03:57:59.919]  Whether it comes to news or anything else we're doing, then to know I'm telling the truth, and to know that you'll just listen to me and take action, it will change your life.
[03:58:00.785 --> 03:58:04.166]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have two great products that have been sold out for a long time.
[03:58:04.526 --> 03:58:07.307]  They're now back in stock at InfowarStore.com.

[03:58:19.632 --> 03:58:20.372]  It is amazing.
[03:58:20.813 --> 03:58:23.033]  Both of these products fund the Infowar.
[03:58:23.634 --> 03:58:26.215]  So they could be placebo and it'd still be great if you fund the Infowar.
[03:58:26.515 --> 03:58:26.935]  They're not.
[03:58:27.595 --> 03:58:30.517]  If you'll just try TurboForce, you'll see the results in 30 minutes.
[03:58:30.837 --> 03:58:33.159]  Incredible energy for 10 hours without the letdown.
[03:58:33.519 --> 03:58:39.282]  But if you will just take X3 on average for about two weeks, you will see amazing results because it's the missing link.
[03:58:39.923 --> 03:58:46.067]  X3 and TurboForce, both discounted now for a limited time at Infolwerestore.com.
