[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   What we've tried to do over the years is to use the expertise,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   the resources to allow us to respond better to a deliberate affront or attack on us
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]  with a microbe of any type, engineered or what have you.
[00:00:28.748 --> 00:00:33.412]  To use that knowledge to better prepare us for what we know will happen.
[00:00:33.772 --> 00:00:47.899]  Instead of looking at it in two separate silos of biodefense for biological threats that are deliberate and countermeasures for naturally occurring, you should essentially pool the science so that you could do both.
[00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:56.623]  At least 15 federal agencies knew that gain-of-function research was being done in the Wuhan lab since, what, 2018?
[00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:03.769]  We've gotten all of our information from Whistleblower, but we now know it wasn't just one agency that China was approaching.
[00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:13.076]  China made a presentation, or an American representative, Peter Daszak, made a representation to 15 agencies about creating a virus that, guess what?
[00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:19.397]  Looks suspiciously like COVID-19 and looks like no other virus in nature from that family.
[00:01:19.837 --> 00:01:22.858]  They were working on this and presented it to 15 agencies.
[00:01:23.318 --> 00:01:30.940]  And in 2020, when they saw COVID-19, they should have all been calling and raising the alarm and saying, my goodness, we saw this two years ago.
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.420]  We knew the Chinese were doing this.
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.061]  Lo and behold, they did it.
[00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:38.401]  A brave Marine, a lieutenant colonel, came forward and gave us that information.
[00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:40.622]  Or today, we would still not know any of this.
[00:01:40.922 --> 00:01:47.927]  The great COVID cover-up, shocking truth about Wuhan and 16 federal agencies.
[00:01:48.328 --> 00:01:51.050]  Yeah, Senator, they were lying.
[00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:01.057]  And the lying had real consequences for children, their mental health, their education, for business, for our faith, not being able to go to houses of worship.
[00:02:01.577 --> 00:02:03.599]  I mean, that's fundamental American freedoms.
[00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.763]  And I'll ask you again, what should the consequences be for Anthony Fauci?
[00:02:09.878 --> 00:02:10.259]  Jail.
[00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.222]  You know, I've sent two referrals to the Department of Justice.
[00:02:13.302 --> 00:02:15.525]  I think he lied to Congress, which is a felony.
[00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:17.988]  Anthony Fauci did lie to Congress.
[00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:19.831]  We know that from his own words.
[00:02:19.871 --> 00:02:23.055]  Not because I say he lies, but his private emails say he was lying.
[00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:27.080]   Virtually everything he said in private Contradicted what he was saying in public.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.162]  And he was fairly honest in private.
[00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:30.724]  In private, he said masks don't work.
[00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:33.247]  In public, he wore three masks.
[00:02:33.447 --> 00:02:37.893]  In private, he admitted that there was such a thing as natural immunity gained from getting the infection.
[00:02:38.313 --> 00:02:40.756]  In public, he was like, you know, we're not going to measure that.
[00:02:40.796 --> 00:02:41.757]  It's unpredictable.
[00:02:42.118 --> 00:02:43.299]  And what are they talking about?
[00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.061]  They're talking about this.
[00:02:46.397 --> 00:02:48.218]  The New York Post is finally covering it.
[00:02:48.498 --> 00:02:53.401]  Three years ago, a lot of these emails were already public, but now even more emails are public.
[00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:56.902]  Whistleblower shares more COVID origin emails.
[00:02:56.982 --> 00:03:00.864]  Fauci advisor allegedly concealed on private account house panel.
[00:03:01.225 --> 00:03:02.825]  We had emails in late 2020.
[00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:08.208]  So over three years ago, we've covered it ad nauseam from the EcoHealth Alliance.
[00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:27.175]   And a lot of that is because what Dr. Huff, who was the vice president of it, ...was giving it to Tom Renz and others, and later testified to Congress and others, that they were developing COVID-19 for the CIA and the Defense Department, and they were developing the vaccine before they ever released COVID.
[00:03:28.067 --> 00:03:29.808]  And Fauci was calling it gain of function.
[00:03:30.048 --> 00:03:33.809]  Well now, all these other incredible emails have come out.
[00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.150]  It was premeditated.
[00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.651]  It was launched against the people.
[00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:38.231]  Life expectancy is dropping.
[00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:39.652]  Cancer is exploding.
[00:03:39.672 --> 00:03:43.533]  We have a 40 plus percent increase in the overall morbidity rate.
[00:03:43.774 --> 00:03:47.035]  World population is now dropping for the first time since the Black Plague.
[00:03:47.355 --> 00:03:48.876]  They have now launched this attack.
[00:03:49.616 --> 00:03:50.876]  It doesn't get exposed fully.
[00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:58.258]  If people aren't brought to justice, they've now beta-tested, launching an even more deadly virus and even more deadly injection in the future.
[00:03:58.278 --> 00:04:01.239]  This is a test to see if they can depopulate.
[00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:06.921]  These shots order the body to mass-produce the HIV spike protein.
[00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:19.765]   We knew in January of 2020, because the Indian major university, the CRISPR gene editing system, And they scanned the damn virus and said it was from five viruses man-made.
[00:04:20.445 --> 00:04:23.106]  And then later it was confirmed by all these other governments and institutions.
[00:04:23.627 --> 00:04:25.868]  In the literature, it is a fact.
[00:04:26.668 --> 00:04:28.109]  In peer-reviewed studies, it's man-made.
[00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:29.409]  It is a fact.
[00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.270]  It's got a big rhino horn on it.
[00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.471]  The biggest spike protein ever seen is HIV.
[00:04:34.457 --> 00:04:37.902]  That literally goes and plugs into the cell with a big spike.
[00:04:38.042 --> 00:04:43.509]  You're literally looking in that movie of what they're describing as an alien attacking of an HIV virus.
[00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.213]  So, that's the spike protein, folks.
[00:04:46.694 --> 00:04:52.141]  And it's very, very, very frustrating to sit here and watch all this unfolding.
[00:04:56.164 --> 00:04:56.985]  I think the U.S.
[00:04:57.045 --> 00:05:03.432]  economy is about to hit the skids and Russia and the BRICS nations are playing a masterful game of chess.
[00:05:03.912 --> 00:05:06.134]  And our administration's going in with like a checkerboard.
[00:05:06.154 --> 00:05:06.835]  They're not even playing.
[00:05:06.895 --> 00:05:09.017]  And the Federal Reserve has signaled they're down with interest rates.
[00:05:09.498 --> 00:05:16.125]  And things are going to get so bad, the globalists are going to usher in a new world of central bank digital currency.
[00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:18.145]  A form of money you cannot see.
[00:05:18.606 --> 00:05:20.486]  Central Bank Digital Currencies.
[00:05:20.806 --> 00:05:22.447]  They don't hide in the shadows anymore.
[00:05:22.487 --> 00:05:24.787]  They tell us exactly what they're going to do.
[00:05:25.187 --> 00:05:25.587]  Exactly.
[00:05:25.607 --> 00:05:26.448]  That's what's so frustrating.
[00:05:26.708 --> 00:05:30.889]  If you study it, you know the battle plan, but they know the public doesn't check that out.
[00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:32.989]  But we're able to give it to the public.
[00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:34.470]  That could really mess up their operation.
[00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.811]  The world is going to see a functioning CBDC very soon, within the coming year.
[00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:42.432]  We saw bank failure 1.0.
[00:05:43.112 --> 00:05:47.654]  It was Silicon Valley, Credit Suisse, First Republic, Silvergate Bank.
[00:05:47.874 --> 00:05:48.695]  I mean, all of those.
[00:05:48.935 --> 00:05:56.438]  First, we had the effects of a dramatic rise in interest rates, leading to the closure of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank.
[00:05:56.838 --> 00:05:58.539]  That was just a tremor before the bank failure.
[00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:01.540]  Yes, I think bank failures 2.0 is coming.
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.362]  I mean just last week the CEO of Citigroup said we're laying off 10% of our workforce.
[00:06:07.822 --> 00:06:15.726]   So at times of crisis, which happens to be happening during an election year, People will say, okay, this is so bad.
[00:06:15.786 --> 00:06:16.647]  Banks are shutting down.
[00:06:16.727 --> 00:06:18.308]  All this economic failure.
[00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:19.610]  We'll give you what you want.
[00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.551]  Government just will give you away our freedoms.
[00:06:21.871 --> 00:06:22.932]  Just take care of us.
[00:06:23.032 --> 00:06:24.614]  Make sure that we can still feed our family.
[00:06:24.834 --> 00:06:26.375]  This is happening in surprising numbers.
[00:06:26.575 --> 00:06:29.458]  We all sort of take our local bank for granted until it's gone.
[00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:32.420]  That's happening in 4,000 other locations around the country.
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:39.086]  And I think in the months ahead, we'll get more failures of regional banks around office space and commercial real estate.
[00:06:39.562 --> 00:06:45.588]  Surveillance and privacy issues could arise if the central bank is able to monitor every transaction.
[00:06:45.688 --> 00:06:53.375]  We've had over the last three weeks major disturbances in the banking world, right?
[00:06:53.535 --> 00:06:58.640]  This comes after the regional bank suffered a week-long plunge in its stock, plus a credit downgrade.
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:11.549]  We've seen stocks of things like Comerica Bank, PacWest Bank, New York Community Bank, and even Schwab just start to hit the skids.
[00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:14.672]  By the way, when you first came on months ago, you predicted this.
[00:07:15.812 --> 00:07:18.654]  Yeah, I mean, because the writing was on the wall.
[00:07:18.694 --> 00:07:26.040]  There's another big concern that a central bank issued digital currency could cause a bank run during economic instability.
[00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:27.480]  Here's the ugly reality.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.662]  We are no different than Argentina, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Greece, Cyprus.
[00:07:33.143 --> 00:07:41.307]  Any country who loses demand for their currency and is forced to print, they go into an inflationary spiral that brings social chaos.
[00:07:41.767 --> 00:07:51.169]  Tangible assets like gold and silver are so important, not just because they're growing, because I think it's a means to protect your financial privacy and financial freedom.
[00:07:51.529 --> 00:08:04.232]  I think there's going to be alternative systems of using tangible assets like gold and silver to back private currencies for individuals to actually be able to transact business on their own, not be a digital slave in their digital world.
[00:08:04.652 --> 00:08:08.873]  These are the kind of solutions that I've been shouting from the rooftops for decades, Alex.
[00:08:09.133 --> 00:08:10.474]  Inflation is coming.
[00:08:10.834 --> 00:08:14.476]  What happens to tangible assets like gold and silver during inflation?
[00:08:14.836 --> 00:08:15.396]  They go up!
[00:08:15.576 --> 00:08:17.778]  People do need to get basic gold and silver.
[00:08:18.118 --> 00:08:20.839]  They need to at least stick their toe in the ocean and do it.
[00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:23.461]  They need to go to your website, KEPM.
[00:08:23.561 --> 00:08:25.582]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[00:08:26.022 --> 00:08:32.946]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:08:32.785 --> 00:08:34.885]  605-3900.
[00:08:34.885 --> 00:08:37.885]   And I need to talk to you folks and start getting gold and silver
[00:08:37.885 --> 00:08:39.185]  bullion now.
[00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:42.785]  But but regardless, we're in for an insane time.
[00:08:42.785 --> 00:08:50.785]   While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:08:50.785 --> 00:08:55.085]  Visit InfoWars.com/show and share the link today.
[00:08:55.085 --> 00:08:59.685]   We got another incredibly powerful transmission lined up for you
[00:08:59.685 --> 00:09:02.484]  today on this Tuesday, April 16th, 2024.
[00:09:02.484 --> 00:09:03.484]  Transmission.
[00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.420]  We're now 30 years and counting on air.
[00:09:07.841 --> 00:09:10.503]  202 days, 12 hours, 33 minutes, 28 seconds.
[00:09:11.683 --> 00:09:13.305]  The most important election in world history.
[00:09:13.325 --> 00:09:31.281]   You know, I was thinking this morning driving into the InfoWars News Center here in Austin, Texas, about the fact that 95% of what we predicted would happen 30 years ago, 25 years ago is when I was really informed 20 years ago, has all come true.
[00:09:31.301 --> 00:09:36.281]  I was wet behind the ears 30 years ago, but still more informed the general public that I've learned a lot.
[00:09:36.902 --> 00:09:43.803]  The process of being fully immersed in research and history and current events and geopolitical systems and different power elites.
[00:09:47.924 --> 00:09:53.199]   But it hit me that We don't have 30 years now to turn this around.
[00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:54.059]  We've got a few years.
[00:09:55.079 --> 00:09:59.661]  Because we're not in the beta testing of the New World Order, we are deep into its operational phase.
[00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:15.906]  And I know I've talked a lot about that, but last night, this morning, when I was getting ready for the show, because I'm basically always researching, unless I take a little time off with the family for dinner or to go swimming or hike or whatever, that I'm researching five, six, seven, eight hours a day.
[00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.031]  That the globalists really are at war with the people.
[00:10:20.271 --> 00:10:29.974]  And I know we talk about that a lot, but when you really look at what they're doing, they're at war with humanity.
[00:10:30.014 --> 00:10:31.114]  They're at war with stability.
[00:10:31.514 --> 00:10:32.774]  They're at war with themselves.
[00:10:32.814 --> 00:10:36.495]  They're even working against their own interest in the final equation.
[00:10:37.256 --> 00:10:39.776]  They really are coming to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:10:40.416 --> 00:10:45.818]  And today, I was just looking at the developments, and each one of these we could do the entire show on.
[00:10:47.352 --> 00:11:08.090]  Now Julian Assange's brother is joining us in the second hour to talk about not just trying to get Julian Assange out of prison to stop the solitary confinement torture, but also his amazing legacy so far and how the man is a hero who should be hoisted on our shoulders, not in a dungeon.
[00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:11.353]  So we're going to review some of the big stories.
[00:11:11.393 --> 00:11:12.334]  WikiLeaks is broken.
[00:11:15.188 --> 00:11:22.295]  The lies about WMDs, the torture, the pedophilia of the Democratic Party.
[00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:31.143]  All of that coming up with his brother today and Biden signaling that he may drop the charges.
[00:11:31.643 --> 00:11:33.425]  One of the biggest failures of Trump not doing that.
[00:11:34.686 --> 00:11:43.436]   So that is coming up in the second hour and I've been Targeted by the same groups.
[00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:52.362]  I've not gone through 110th hell not not not one 100th really of what Julian has done.
[00:11:53.023 --> 00:11:56.325]  I've been in solitary confinement twice when I was a teenager.
[00:11:57.546 --> 00:12:02.190]  Because no matter who started the fight when the police show up and somebody's in an ambulance.
[00:12:03.451 --> 00:12:06.593]  The blood coming out of their ears and in a coma you go to jail.
[00:12:07.654 --> 00:12:10.957]  Until you get a court date and I've been in solitary confinement for.
[00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:12.519]  Two weeks.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.661]  And I absolutely hated it.
[00:12:15.722 --> 00:12:16.302]  It was horrible.
[00:12:17.043 --> 00:12:27.672]  I would be allowed out every, uh, both times in Dallas, in juvenile, every two to three days to take a 10 minute shower.
[00:12:27.692 --> 00:12:34.217]  And they would have guards standing around me the whole time because again, uh, I was violent.
[00:12:35.535 --> 00:12:37.516]  And they just had the police reports there.
[00:12:38.456 --> 00:12:39.276]  And I mean, I get it.
[00:12:40.316 --> 00:12:42.117]  That was a savage and I'm not even proud of it.
[00:12:42.917 --> 00:12:43.597]  But that's what happens.
[00:12:43.637 --> 00:12:47.118]  But Julian Assange has done none of this.
[00:12:47.318 --> 00:12:52.079]  And it all started when he had sex with two CIA sex operatives.
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.400]  They admitted it was consensual, but the condom broke.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.441]  So it's rape.
[00:12:57.461 --> 00:13:02.322]  And I can't tell you how many times they put sex operatives on me.
[00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:10.911]  When I'm at a restaurant or a bar on a trip, this happens almost every time, and I just look at them and I say, you've got to be ashamed of yourselves.
[00:13:11.931 --> 00:13:14.113]  It's always graduate, you know, Ph.D.
[00:13:14.133 --> 00:13:14.633]  type women.
[00:13:15.073 --> 00:13:15.974]  They're 30 years old.
[00:13:16.034 --> 00:13:17.075]  They think they're super hot.
[00:13:17.655 --> 00:13:19.136]  They come over and tell you how great you are.
[00:13:19.196 --> 00:13:20.417]  Let's go to your hotel room right now.
[00:13:20.437 --> 00:13:23.939]  And I just look at them and I say, take the CIA and go jump in a lake.
[00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:29.543]  And they turn red and shake their heads as if I can't tell what's going on.
[00:13:31.007 --> 00:13:34.569]  So that's his only crime, was thinking with his little head and not his big one.
[00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:43.654]  And for that, he's been self-imposed and then actual solitary now for six years, and it's wrong.
[00:13:45.015 --> 00:13:46.576]  So that's coming up in the second hour.
[00:13:48.977 --> 00:13:52.999]  The Trump first criminal trial is incredible.
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:14:04.244]   I mean, if you think all the other show trials and civil trials and fake rape trials and his real estate trial, Well, there was no jury, though he requested one is bad.
[00:14:04.264 --> 00:14:05.565]  This new one.
[00:14:06.646 --> 00:14:07.506]  Takes the cake.
[00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:11.670]  In that they're charging him with election interference.
[00:14:13.851 --> 00:14:14.632]  In 2000.
[00:14:18.055 --> 00:14:18.215]  And 16.
[00:14:20.677 --> 00:14:23.419]  With money to Stormy Daniels reportedly.
[00:14:23.439 --> 00:14:23.499]  But.
[00:14:28.137 --> 00:14:33.520]  They're the ones election meddling, saying he can't leave for two weeks to two months.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.461]  They won't say how long the judge is going to have it last.
[00:14:36.862 --> 00:14:41.305]  And so he's not allowed to go to the Supreme Court for his immunity case next week.
[00:14:42.325 --> 00:14:45.427]  He can't go to his son's high school graduation.
[00:14:46.968 --> 00:14:48.569]  He's pinned down in New York.
[00:14:49.049 --> 00:14:54.092]  And then when he walks out and attacks the judge, which everybody knows under the Constitution, you're right to say this judge is a fraud.
[00:14:54.492 --> 00:14:55.053]  I'm innocent.
[00:14:55.713 --> 00:14:57.334]  They're all over the news attacking him.
[00:14:58.854 --> 00:15:02.737]  They're now moving for contempt of court against Trump.
[00:15:03.677 --> 00:15:14.164]  So that is just spectacular, Orwellville, where exactly what they're doing to him, they claim he's on trial for.
[00:15:15.345 --> 00:15:16.546]  Spectacular.
[00:15:16.946 --> 00:15:17.727]  We're gonna hit that.
[00:15:19.708 --> 00:15:20.689]  Gotta stack on that.
[00:15:22.298 --> 00:15:27.442]  Then I've known about this, and before I clicked on it this morning at like 6 a.m.
[00:15:27.482 --> 00:15:31.124]  when I was doing research, I thought, okay, I already know all this.
[00:15:32.485 --> 00:15:39.550]  But thank God Dr. Phil, who I think is a great guy, he's exposing transgender cult, all of it, the open border, you name it.
[00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:41.491]  He's really stepping up.
[00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:42.452]  I've always liked him.
[00:15:43.473 --> 00:15:45.614]  Compared to anything on corporate media, he's about as good as it gets.
[00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:50.937]   I watched A two minute clip and I went, well, I better find the full thing.
[00:15:50.957 --> 00:15:52.439]  So I went and found large excerpts.
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:57.103]  And I knew a lot of this, but I hadn't thought about it in a while.
[00:15:57.143 --> 00:15:59.345]  And I was kind of mad at myself for not making a bigger deal about it.
[00:16:00.967 --> 00:16:06.953]  Because they've built more than 20 secret communist Chinese military bases.
[00:16:09.023 --> 00:16:10.725]  Run by communist generals.
[00:16:10.765 --> 00:16:12.747]  And when I say secret, it's not been in the news.
[00:16:12.787 --> 00:16:19.253]  I mean, we've covered it, but it's hiding in plain view with 700-foot observation towers.
[00:16:19.773 --> 00:16:26.199]  Now, for those that don't know, the military puts balloons up at 700 to 1,000 feet because you can put cameras over the horizon on them.
[00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:30.383]  And they're jacked in to all the power grid.
[00:16:31.232 --> 00:16:37.875]  Because when you opt into these windmill systems, you're in the national grid, through the Texas grid, that is the most powerful in the country.
[00:16:38.375 --> 00:16:42.677]  It's over 30% of the nation's power, supplying more than a dozen states part of their power.
[00:16:43.497 --> 00:16:50.300]  And I already knew this, but Bill did a superlative job with his guest explaining it.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:57.043]  And I just, it really hit me this morning that our government is destroying the country for real.
[00:16:57.878 --> 00:16:59.018]  They're at war with us.
[00:16:59.498 --> 00:17:00.519]  It's totally criminal.
[00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:02.779]  I don't care how many good people are in the government.
[00:17:02.879 --> 00:17:03.299]  I know that.
[00:17:03.339 --> 00:17:09.921]  I'm not saying the government itself is the enemy, but the people running it are destroying their own interest as well.
[00:17:10.001 --> 00:17:11.622]  They don't give a damn.
[00:17:11.662 --> 00:17:15.023]  They are selling the nation out in live time.
[00:17:15.923 --> 00:17:16.983]  It is just incredible.
[00:17:18.464 --> 00:17:22.465]  So, I knew they put up 5G towers to jack into everything.
[00:17:22.485 --> 00:17:35.591]   For those that know, 5G can just basically force hack The systems they can send through it, any device, any appliance, any automobile, you name it.
[00:17:35.651 --> 00:17:41.695]  And everything's been set up for the NSA and the globalists to do that, but they're letting the Chai-coms be part of it as well.
[00:17:41.715 --> 00:17:57.863]  And I remember Reuters six years ago reported what we were already reporting, that Apple gave all their code keys to every Apple device, iPad, iPhone, EarPods, everywhere.
[00:17:59.093 --> 00:18:04.695]  And just the other day, I got home, my wife was out, and I was on the iPad, and I wasn't trying to spy on my wife.
[00:18:04.715 --> 00:18:11.777]  Her iPad, iPod, Apple Tracker system popped up without me even asking for it.
[00:18:11.797 --> 00:18:21.120]  It just popped up, and I tried to close it, and I looked at it, and I'm like, oh, what's that?
[00:18:21.641 --> 00:18:24.442]  And I just zoomed in on it, and oh, she's in an AA meeting.
[00:18:24.462 --> 00:18:25.302]  Well, good for her.
[00:18:25.322 --> 00:18:27.723]  She said she had something to do, would be home late.
[00:18:27.743 --> 00:18:28.363]  There was a nanny there.
[00:18:29.611 --> 00:18:44.543]  Now imagine the power that ChaiComs have in that all our devices that are Apple, and the droids are even worse, by the way, they have that ability.
[00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:46.765]  And I thought, I never looked at this.
[00:18:46.785 --> 00:18:48.647]  Let me look, well, where are these iPods?
[00:18:48.767 --> 00:18:49.748]  Okay, they're in the bedroom.
[00:18:50.108 --> 00:18:51.629]  We have like eight devices.
[00:18:54.111 --> 00:18:58.335]  Even iPads we haven't had for years, they were listed there.
[00:18:59.966 --> 00:19:02.570]  So that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.430]  And by law, all new cars...
[00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:14.430]   And it's been being put in the new cars for at least 20 years.
[00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:23.234]  But under law, all new cars have these tracker chips in them to track you in live time with GPS and cell phone tower triangulation.
[00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:25.075]  You're like, well, what do I have to hide?
[00:19:25.095 --> 00:19:26.635]  No, no.
[00:19:26.695 --> 00:19:28.136]  It's like, why do you have locked doors at night?
[00:19:28.396 --> 00:19:29.296]  Not that you're a criminal.
[00:19:29.356 --> 00:19:30.357]  There's bad people.
[00:19:30.897 --> 00:19:33.618]  Why do you have a code key for your bank account?
[00:19:33.998 --> 00:19:37.280]  Why do you have a lock on your locker at the gym?
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.762]   Because That creates a layer of security.
[00:19:41.102 --> 00:19:48.166]  It's all gone, it's all completely fried, and the people running our country are completely sold out to China, and anybody else will give them money.
[00:19:49.786 --> 00:19:52.448]  And it's completely and absolutely insane.
[00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:59.931]  So, where am I going with this?
[00:19:59.971 --> 00:20:00.992]  Well, here's the next stack.
[00:20:01.952 --> 00:20:02.653]  Terrifying!
[00:20:02.753 --> 00:20:04.594]  And I went and looked at the bill when I saw this yesterday.
[00:20:05.731 --> 00:20:06.431]  Terrifying!
[00:20:06.531 --> 00:20:09.653]  FISA bill, and I remember they tried this a few years ago.
[00:20:09.813 --> 00:20:10.493]  It didn't pass.
[00:20:10.953 --> 00:20:13.574]  They're not just re-upping the FISA bill to warrantly spy on us.
[00:20:14.115 --> 00:20:14.735]  Terrifying!
[00:20:14.815 --> 00:20:22.438]  FISA bill set to include vast new surveillance powers, forcing businesses to become NSA spies.
[00:20:24.299 --> 00:20:30.125]   That's Jamie, you wanted InfoWars, but you can pull up Reuters and all the rest are reporting it, but it's to keep us safe.
[00:20:30.205 --> 00:20:37.569]  And of course, iPatch McCain, our Texas Congressman, he loves it.
[00:20:38.129 --> 00:20:46.374]  House Intelligence Committee FISA Reform Bill would greatly expand the class of businesses and other entities required to assist in FISA 702.
[00:20:47.274 --> 00:20:57.967]   If you have any type of internet business, including a coffee shop, if you serve more than 20 people a month, You're supposed to then report and hook them in.
[00:20:58.968 --> 00:21:00.730]  Well, let me just say, we're not doing it.
[00:21:02.451 --> 00:21:05.193]  Because we're an internet service system, according to this.
[00:21:05.253 --> 00:21:11.738]  I'm not going to jack in and openly, because they're already jacked into everything, when it leaves your office.
[00:21:11.819 --> 00:21:15.201]  But now they want you to opt in, so you're agreeing to it all.
[00:21:15.221 --> 00:21:18.644]  Like when you heard the police, oh, let us have access to all your surveillance cameras.
[00:21:18.984 --> 00:21:25.907]   Sounds great, but then when the criminals get busted, The Soros DAs just let them go anyways.
[00:21:25.927 --> 00:21:29.048]  Again, it's like they search you at the TSA and grab your testicles.
[00:21:30.028 --> 00:21:30.508]  Happened to me.
[00:21:30.968 --> 00:21:31.829]  I was out of town.
[00:21:32.009 --> 00:21:32.969]  Didn't go outside the U.S.
[00:21:32.989 --> 00:21:34.730]  Just went on a vacation, as you know, for 12 days.
[00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.011]  And both times, I'm on some list.
[00:21:39.991 --> 00:21:40.992]  They won't tell me what list.
[00:21:41.052 --> 00:21:42.812]  That's always part of real tyranny.
[00:21:43.393 --> 00:21:44.793]  And both times, I got pulled out.
[00:21:44.813 --> 00:21:46.154]  And would you like to go to private screening room?
[00:21:46.174 --> 00:21:46.974]  Would you like to send such?
[00:21:47.034 --> 00:21:47.174]  No.
[00:21:48.274 --> 00:21:49.275]  Just hurry up and do it.
[00:21:49.715 --> 00:21:51.076]  By the way, I'm a big listener, Mr. Jones.
[00:21:51.096 --> 00:21:51.797]  Sorry we have to do this.
[00:21:52.237 --> 00:21:53.618]  I'm like, yeah, the border's wide open.
[00:21:53.638 --> 00:21:55.119]  There's massive human smuggling.
[00:21:55.419 --> 00:21:56.560]  He goes, I know, it's just a job.
[00:21:58.101 --> 00:21:59.222]  One of the guys talking was a listener.
[00:21:59.242 --> 00:21:59.963]  The other person didn't.
[00:22:00.263 --> 00:22:07.088]  And I got a dude, you know, rubbing my crotch and rubbing my ass and sticking his finger in my waistband.
[00:22:08.509 --> 00:22:11.311]  And that's just the humiliation ritual, because I'm a dirty American.
[00:22:11.812 --> 00:22:12.772]  That's good training for me.
[00:22:13.293 --> 00:22:30.392]   But if the comment is Chinese, Want to buy hundreds of thousands of acres, thousands of square miles, wait till we play the report, all over the country, right next to military bases and right next to the border, and openly put up 700 foot spy towers with 5G and HD cameras.
[00:22:31.452 --> 00:22:32.012]  It's wonderful!
[00:22:33.953 --> 00:22:36.714]  The government is at war with the people.
[00:22:39.496 --> 00:22:48.166]   America was the thing in the way of global government because if people could aspire to due process and private property and freedom, They never buy into a global tyranny.
[00:22:49.966 --> 00:22:56.508]  But it just has really hit me, and I'm not giving up when I say this, it's the opposite, but it really hit me last night, this morning.
[00:22:57.049 --> 00:22:58.289]  We are already conquered.
[00:22:58.829 --> 00:23:01.910]  We are completely F you, you know what, Cade.
[00:23:03.411 --> 00:23:09.863]   And the crazy part is the establishment goes along with this and thinks they're winning.
[00:23:10.103 --> 00:23:17.746]  When you get rid of due process and get rid of private property, and just because you're in the club now doesn't mean you'll be in the club in six months or a year or a day.
[00:23:19.307 --> 00:23:29.552]  Smart elites can still be corrupt and boss hog and run things, have a bunch of money and skim, but they don't get rid of the due process and the basic freedom because it'll burn them.
[00:23:31.432 --> 00:23:38.299]   This establishment is so satanic and so immoral Because the general public is lazy and immoral.
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:39.360]  Not everybody.
[00:23:41.161 --> 00:23:45.363]  But I'm 50, I've lived a lot, I've done a lot, I've been around, and let me tell you something.
[00:23:47.004 --> 00:23:49.125]  And I'm not saying this in general, I'm not saying everybody.
[00:23:50.766 --> 00:23:59.210]  But per capita, the young people are getting more and more corrupt, more and more deceptive, and I mean like 50 and below.
[00:24:00.191 --> 00:24:02.772]  The boomers are very selfish and naive.
[00:24:04.778 --> 00:24:07.740]  The young people, a large portion of them are criminals.
[00:24:08.801 --> 00:24:11.103]  And you've got honorable people and you've got dishonorable.
[00:24:11.163 --> 00:24:12.884]  And the honorable are more honorable than ever.
[00:24:13.925 --> 00:24:15.566]  We got some of our best people are young people.
[00:24:16.347 --> 00:24:20.770]  But I have seen it for myself, outright criminal activity everywhere.
[00:24:22.752 --> 00:24:25.053]  And I've known the globalists are corrupt.
[00:24:26.574 --> 00:24:40.512]   But I've been naive about how much the average person When given the ability, we'll hurt you, we'll rob you, we'll stab you in the back.
[00:24:41.332 --> 00:24:45.754]  And they don't understand, I've used the analogy a thousand times, it's not like pissing in the pool.
[00:24:46.034 --> 00:24:52.076]  You go to a community pool and everybody's pissing in, they gotta put more chlorine and stuff in and it burns your eyes and it's toxic and who wants to swim in a toilet?
[00:24:54.187 --> 00:24:57.548]  Oh, as many times in my life, I can't afford a personal pool, so I love the pool.
[00:24:57.608 --> 00:24:58.028]  I go to them.
[00:24:58.228 --> 00:25:02.010]  Try to find the smaller community pools or friends that have apartments that have got clean pools.
[00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:06.211]  I don't like to go to the community pool because you learn you're better than piss.
[00:25:06.951 --> 00:25:11.453]  But if one person takes a dump in the pool, they got to shut it down because everybody sees it.
[00:25:11.773 --> 00:25:12.493]  You can't hide it.
[00:25:12.593 --> 00:25:13.074]  It's toxic.
[00:25:13.094 --> 00:25:13.634]  They got to drain it.
[00:25:16.535 --> 00:25:20.016]  And so the old corrupt establishment was peeing in the pool.
[00:25:22.332 --> 00:25:33.000]  The establishment we've got now has hooked up a 12-inch pipe from the main sewer line and has filled the pool with pure cess, pure feces.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.041]  You can't see any water.
[00:25:35.101 --> 00:25:36.422]  You can't see any blue light.
[00:25:37.063 --> 00:25:38.424]  You can't even see down an inch.
[00:25:38.584 --> 00:25:40.385]  It's solid feces.
[00:25:43.827 --> 00:25:48.151]  The federal government is solid feces at the top, which contaminates the whole thing.
[00:25:49.772 --> 00:25:51.313]  The public is dumbed down and decadent.
[00:25:54.602 --> 00:25:56.623]  We've killed 60 million plus babies.
[00:25:59.545 --> 00:26:00.886]  There is no due process.
[00:26:02.467 --> 00:26:03.848]  We've been hit with a bioweapon.
[00:26:04.409 --> 00:26:12.254]  Mainline British journals, government journals confirm, okay, yeah, it's 20 plus million dead worldwide from the shots.
[00:26:12.294 --> 00:26:17.577]  That's top doctors in the UK that were pro-shot have come out and said, we were wrong.
[00:26:18.018 --> 00:26:19.459]  By the way, the government knows it's deliberate.
[00:26:19.479 --> 00:26:20.179]  They're killing everyone.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:21.880]  That's in the news.
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:22.581]  That's a whole nother stack.
[00:26:25.424 --> 00:26:26.185]  Peer-reviewed study.
[00:26:26.225 --> 00:26:28.228]  Cancer deaths increase after COVID vaccination.
[00:26:28.548 --> 00:26:29.650]  British government-backed study.
[00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:31.512]  I mean, there's no doubt.
[00:26:33.335 --> 00:26:36.078]  And you try to tell the average person that's taking these shots?
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:47.305]  This has happened and they are so selfish and lazy mentally, they'll decide you're a liar because they don't want to face the truth and they'll double down and continue to take more.
[00:26:47.605 --> 00:26:49.846]  You can say, well that's a Darwin Award, they deserve to die.
[00:26:50.126 --> 00:26:51.427]  Well the children sure as hell don't.
[00:26:51.847 --> 00:26:57.510]  And I've got stacks of news here of college football players and others dropping dead of heart attacks, died suddenly.
[00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:01.572]  We don't just have the scientific evidence, we have the anecdotal all around us.
[00:27:02.532 --> 00:27:11.140]   You don't need to be a pathologist or an epidemiologist or a biologist, but if you go out to eat at a restaurant
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:14.100]   and your whole family gets sick, and then later you see it in the newspaper
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:21.740]   that 300 sick, one dies at this restaurant, that they had bacteria and the toxins
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:25.459]   the bacteria put off in the food, and then there'll be a lawsuit.
[00:27:25.459 --> 00:27:28.180]  You know it was bad food.
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.779]   It was either a bacteria or toxins, something got in the food.
[00:27:31.779 --> 00:27:35.299]  You don't need to be a pathologist or a coroner.
[00:27:35.299 --> 00:27:41.100]   If you're sitting there in your car, driving on the highway, and you see a car flip and blow up,
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.500]   and bodies fly around, and you later hear on the news that three people died in a car wreck.
[00:27:45.159 --> 00:27:48.600]  I mean, you need to be a pathologist to know it was the car wreck you saw that killed them.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.861]  I mean, I've sat there multiple times and seen people die in front of me on the highway.
[00:27:54.401 --> 00:27:55.341]  Absolutely gruesome.
[00:27:57.902 --> 00:27:59.222]  And you know that person's dead.
[00:28:00.256 --> 00:28:01.296]  They're a homeless person.
[00:28:01.316 --> 00:28:02.817]  They just ran out in front of an 18-wheeler.
[00:28:03.217 --> 00:28:04.518]  It just ran over their ass.
[00:28:04.558 --> 00:28:06.598]  Their guts are all over the ground for 100 feet.
[00:28:06.898 --> 00:28:08.519]  There's a big smear of their guts.
[00:28:09.479 --> 00:28:10.980]  Body parts all over the road.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:12.821]  You know they're dead.
[00:28:15.201 --> 00:28:16.502]  But we have the pathologists.
[00:28:16.542 --> 00:28:17.702]  We have the peer-reviewed studies.
[00:28:17.742 --> 00:28:18.583]  We know what they've done.
[00:28:18.743 --> 00:28:22.735]   Again, That's why the enemy hits me and attacks me and laughs at me.
[00:28:22.775 --> 00:28:28.660]  I was in a deposition yesterday, and the guy goes, oh, I noticed in bankruptcy you just liquidated your little farm.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.082]  And he smiled and started laughing like it was making me mad.
[00:28:31.482 --> 00:28:34.805]  I never even have time to go to that little farm I bought outside Austin years and years ago.
[00:28:35.085 --> 00:28:36.986]  That was the spot I might run to if things collapsed.
[00:28:37.287 --> 00:28:38.368]  I've said I'm going down with the ship.
[00:28:38.668 --> 00:28:44.432]  It meant nothing to me that he sat there and giggled and smiled like, ooh, you're going to get mad, aren't you?
[00:28:44.653 --> 00:28:45.974]  It means nothing to me.
[00:28:47.563 --> 00:28:57.409]  We're so far gone, the government, the Pentagon just hit us with a spike protein replicating spongiform encephalopathy style weapon?
[00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:00.671]  You almost killed a bunch of my family.
[00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:01.812]  You killed some of my friends.
[00:29:02.792 --> 00:29:05.014]  And I'm looking at these evil demons laughing at me.
[00:29:05.354 --> 00:29:09.116]  They don't know they're all being hit too because they're so spiritually blind.
[00:29:10.797 --> 00:29:15.320]  I care about a national federal government study I've got right here.
[00:29:19.653 --> 00:29:24.076]  Where they're giving two-year-olds puberty blockers because the two-year-old said, I'm another gender.
[00:29:25.357 --> 00:29:36.746]  Do you think any of us are safe when the federal government, and it's going on all over the world, is injecting two-year-olds because their phreakazoid parents want to create a mutant?
[00:29:40.388 --> 00:29:49.378]   If they can do medical stuff that would make Joseph Mingo a blush to two-year-old babies, They can do anything, people.
[00:29:49.898 --> 00:29:51.258]  It's all over.
[00:29:51.618 --> 00:29:52.919]  It's all gone.
[00:29:53.119 --> 00:29:54.419]  They're already killing us.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.100]  The life expectancy is already dropping.
[00:29:59.841 --> 00:30:02.842]  The cancers and death are exploding.
[00:30:04.603 --> 00:30:05.823]  And I don't say that to scare you.
[00:30:05.863 --> 00:30:12.606]  I say it so you get hardcore how real this is.
[00:30:15.034 --> 00:30:16.516]  And the fact that it's horrible.
[00:30:17.096 --> 00:30:21.481]  But if you'll admit how bad it is, we have a chance to stop it and we're really turning the tide.
[00:30:22.922 --> 00:30:23.983]  I mentioned some of the news.
[00:30:24.043 --> 00:30:24.844]  It gets worse.
[00:30:27.607 --> 00:30:28.928]  But that's some of what's coming up.
[00:30:28.988 --> 00:30:30.830]  What should I hit in detail when we come back?
[00:30:30.649 --> 00:30:37.649]   back. I've already given you a highlight. I'm going to move quick.
[00:30:37.646 --> 00:30:44.029]  Let's do China and the spy bases, the military bases, publicly run by generals, current CCP generals.
[00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:45.030]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:55.634]  But don't worry, the FBI is going to go to hundreds of thousands of conservatives' homes about what you said online, or, you know, we're going to have thousands of agents put thousands of people in jail for walking between velvet ropes.
[00:30:55.755 --> 00:30:57.055]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:30:58.856 --> 00:31:07.860]   While 90,000 kids are missing and sex slavery and other forms of slavery, the Senate report, I mean, under Biden, I'm going to hit the China.
[00:31:08.941 --> 00:31:12.646]  Then I'm going to hit the NSA taking over your computer and turning you into a spy.
[00:31:13.687 --> 00:31:15.249]  Then I'm going to hit the Trump situation.
[00:31:15.289 --> 00:31:15.950]  It's all coming up.
[00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:16.971]  InfoWars.com.
[00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:18.093]  Tomorrow's news today.

[00:32:04.882 --> 00:32:09.025]  Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc, Selenium, L-Glutamine, the list goes on.
[00:32:09.045 --> 00:32:10.546]  I don't even have time to list everything in here.
[00:32:10.566 --> 00:32:14.549]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com and find out what Vitamin Mineral Fusion can do for you.
[00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:20.413]  Ladies and gentlemen, things are going to get really rough.
[00:32:20.454 --> 00:32:24.456]  And I was thinking about writing a book, maybe Alex Jones's Rules.
[00:32:27.739 --> 00:32:31.922]  Don't take it lying down, some kind of headline like that, instead of the experiences, the lessons I've learned.
[00:32:33.792 --> 00:32:35.393]  And I was thinking, what would some of the rules be?
[00:32:36.793 --> 00:32:40.575]  Well, first off, keep your eyes and ears open.
[00:32:41.335 --> 00:32:42.456]  Don't close your eyes.
[00:32:42.516 --> 00:32:44.497]  Don't deny what you're seeing.
[00:32:44.877 --> 00:32:45.877]  Go with your research.
[00:32:45.917 --> 00:32:46.678]  Go with your instincts.
[00:32:46.718 --> 00:32:47.618]  Go with the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:48.479 --> 00:32:51.540]  But also, don't take it lying down.
[00:32:53.481 --> 00:32:55.482]  It's one thing to know what's going on, but do nothing about it.
[00:32:55.542 --> 00:32:56.782]  No, don't take it lying down.
[00:32:59.364 --> 00:33:00.964]  And then Rob was talking to me during the break.
[00:33:01.184 --> 00:33:06.516]   Rob Agueras, he said, yeah, Everything comes to an end.
[00:33:07.036 --> 00:33:08.017]  Death's the great equalizer.
[00:33:08.037 --> 00:33:08.538]  And that's right.
[00:33:09.539 --> 00:33:10.259]  God's real.
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.101]  The globalists aren't God.
[00:33:12.721 --> 00:33:13.742]  And they will come to an end.
[00:33:15.043 --> 00:33:15.924]  Everything comes to an end.
[00:33:19.727 --> 00:33:20.428]  Except God.
[00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:25.352]  And I really feel sorry for the globalists.
[00:33:26.773 --> 00:33:27.994]  I've always hated them.
[00:33:28.915 --> 00:33:32.819]  But I did what I did, not because I hated them, because I loved the people I was fighting for.
[00:33:34.033 --> 00:33:37.675]  As I've gotten older, it was always about 90% love, 10% hate.
[00:33:40.136 --> 00:33:43.597]  But now, it's liberating.
[00:33:43.717 --> 00:33:45.158]  I don't have any hate for these people.
[00:33:45.178 --> 00:33:48.499]  I actually really feel sorry for them.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.700]  Because they missed the boat.
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.381]  They missed the opportunity to be good people.
[00:33:53.341 --> 00:33:55.342]  And in their lives, they didn't become better people.
[00:33:55.382 --> 00:33:56.323]  They became worse people.
[00:33:58.343 --> 00:34:00.004]  I was never a conscious Satanist.
[00:34:00.064 --> 00:34:01.645]  I never got on my knees and prayed to the devil.
[00:34:02.796 --> 00:34:13.746]  But I was enthralled by evil and the pride of Lucifer and almost went to the dark side when I was about 16, 17.
[00:34:15.928 --> 00:34:21.553]  But God reached down and grabbed me by the scruff of my neck and slammed me up against the wall and said, you're not gonna do that.
[00:34:22.694 --> 00:34:25.536]  And put the choice clearly squarely before me and I chose God.
[00:34:26.857 --> 00:34:32.706]   And then God said, we're gonna dig out of what you've done Because faith without works is dead.
[00:34:35.147 --> 00:34:37.227]  And I'm going to use you as an instrument against evil.
[00:34:40.488 --> 00:34:41.008]  And we've done it.
[00:34:42.108 --> 00:34:43.888]  And now our most important work is to come.
[00:34:45.509 --> 00:34:46.569]  They could put me in prison.
[00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:49.009]  They could kill me tomorrow.
[00:34:49.289 --> 00:34:51.810]  And the work we've done here will echo into the future.
[00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:58.071]  And the work you've done supporting us and all the work you've done separately has been devastating to the enemy.
[00:34:59.272 --> 00:35:01.793]  And I want you all to recognize how far we've come together.
[00:35:03.954 --> 00:35:06.795]  But I also want you to recognize how much trouble we're in.
[00:35:08.635 --> 00:35:15.458]  And when you try to apply logic to what our enemies are doing, you have to understand it's a satanic knowledge.
[00:35:16.798 --> 00:35:18.139]  It's a satanic system.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.281]  And it creates a system, but it's a system of deception for its own people.
[00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:29.902]  And the end game is nothing but betrayal and pain and loneliness and separation from God.
[00:35:31.602 --> 00:35:35.043]  And that's not a place anyone consciously would want to be.
[00:35:36.603 --> 00:35:48.966]  That once you're caught in evil, and once you decide to cheat and go with the world because you think it'll give you some power and people will think you're cool, well, you've lost your soul.
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.681]  You can see those people that have lost their souls.
[00:35:53.302 --> 00:35:54.202]  The walking dead.
[00:35:54.222 --> 00:35:56.684]  The zombies.
[00:35:59.126 --> 00:36:00.767]  And I repent for laughing at them.
[00:36:01.808 --> 00:36:05.810]  If you go back ten years ago, I started cutting back on making fun of the left.
[00:36:08.292 --> 00:36:11.154]  And then in the last five years, we've gone to almost zero.
[00:36:12.114 --> 00:36:13.275]  I caught myself doing it.
[00:36:14.336 --> 00:36:18.559]  Last week, and Owen does a great job, when Owen was making fun of Sheila Jackson Lee.
[00:36:20.231 --> 00:36:26.854]  Saying that the moon almost touched the sun during the eclipse and almost set it on fire.
[00:36:28.455 --> 00:36:31.156]  And that the moon is like Saturn, a gas giant.
[00:36:32.317 --> 00:36:36.019]  I mean, the woman literally has a 70 IQ.
[00:36:37.039 --> 00:36:42.122]  Well, that's a joke on us that a mentally retarded person is a powerful U.S.
[00:36:42.162 --> 00:36:42.762]  Congresswoman.
[00:36:43.662 --> 00:36:44.403]  It's not funny.
[00:36:45.223 --> 00:36:52.057]   Like if you got on a jumbo jet and you looked into the cockpit and A person with a lobotomy was flying in.
[00:36:52.297 --> 00:36:57.701]  You wouldn't laugh and go, haha, look, they got a person with a lobotomy flying the airplane.
[00:36:59.142 --> 00:37:07.467]  Or if you saw a serious Down Syndrome individual, beautiful people, love them, not putting them down, but would you laugh at a Down Syndrome person as the pilot?
[00:37:07.867 --> 00:37:10.408]  Or would you say, oh my God, we're all in danger?
[00:37:10.428 --> 00:37:14.371]  It's not funny.
[00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:20.392]  You notice I don't make jokes about these people anymore.
[00:37:20.993 --> 00:37:22.993]  Because it ain't funny.
[00:37:22.993 --> 00:37:33.752]   And I realize that hell on earth is already being released and things are
[00:37:33.752 --> 00:37:34.993]  going to get really bad.
[00:37:34.993 --> 00:37:44.993]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:37:36.224 --> 00:37:42.229]  And I'm somebody that's got guts and I can hack a lot.
[00:37:44.304 --> 00:37:51.952]  And I look around at the general public, who is incredibly soft and incredibly naive, and they have no idea what's coming down on them.
[00:37:53.394 --> 00:37:53.834]  No idea.
[00:37:57.137 --> 00:38:02.183]  And so as Christ hung on the cross, he said, forgive them, Father, because they know not what they do.
[00:38:05.754 --> 00:38:14.984]  And Christ, the focused personification of God, in the Garden of Gethsemane, before he was taken by the Romans, said, Father, let this cup pass from me.
[00:38:15.845 --> 00:38:18.628]  And God told his son, it does not pass from you.
[00:38:19.669 --> 00:38:41.965]   And Jesus wept, because all the sins of the world, by a pure entity, Christ was going to have to experience murder and death and starvation and loneliness and children being tortured and human sacrifice and all the sins that humans had committed were going to commit and were committing at that moment.
[00:38:42.485 --> 00:38:52.254]  God had to take it on for us to transmute the sin so that something unholy could be grafted onto something pure.
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:02.782]  The Bible says at least three times, with the beginning of knowledge comes sorrow, and with great knowledge comes great sorrow.
[00:39:07.283 --> 00:39:09.424]  People that have satanic energy feel invincible.
[00:39:10.684 --> 00:39:11.524]  It's a fire.
[00:39:13.465 --> 00:39:16.526]  It's mindless and it's stupid.
[00:39:18.066 --> 00:39:26.663]   But the pain of great knowledge Is offset by the incredible completion.
[00:39:27.224 --> 00:39:28.084]  It's not ecstasy.
[00:39:28.144 --> 00:39:29.225]  It's total peace.
[00:39:31.746 --> 00:39:32.707]  Of being connected to God.
[00:39:32.727 --> 00:39:33.628]  Let's skip this next break.
[00:39:35.689 --> 00:39:36.529]  Sorry, I told you guys.
[00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:38.491]  I didn't tell you guys to skip it.
[00:39:40.512 --> 00:39:40.812]  So.
[00:39:42.533 --> 00:39:45.533]  We have to mourn for those that have fallen to Satan.
[00:39:45.533 --> 00:39:52.533]  And we have to forgive them.
[00:39:52.654 --> 00:40:00.360]  Because they don't know what they've done, but that does not mean we don't stop them and we don't oppose them.
[00:40:01.681 --> 00:40:08.206]  And when the time is right, in the different ways that God directs us, destroy them.
[00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.332]  And I take no pleasure in our enemy's destruction.
[00:40:16.312 --> 00:40:19.335]  Many of us will be destroyed along with them in the process.
[00:40:20.603 --> 00:40:25.347]  And all of us will pay in this life and at the next level for what we've done.
[00:40:25.387 --> 00:40:27.109]  Make no mistake, God is righteous.
[00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:28.650]  God is pure.
[00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:32.774]  And if you don't know that vengeance is mine, say it the Lord.
[00:40:32.614 --> 00:40:38.813]   And if you don't know, if you are upset about what evil is doing, God is infinitely more
[00:40:38.813 --> 00:40:45.614]   upset because we are only in the waiting room of eternity right now.
[00:40:45.614 --> 00:41:04.333]   Alright, it's, it's, it's so insane that we've done about this.
[00:41:04.359 --> 00:41:11.983]  I remember during the Clinton administration when there were Chinese generals at the White House with giant bags of cash.
[00:41:12.584 --> 00:41:13.424]  It was on C-SPAN.
[00:41:13.544 --> 00:41:15.545]  They were on C-SPAN taking suitcases of cash.
[00:41:18.416 --> 00:41:21.638]  It was Clinton just flaunting, like, why do you flaunt it?
[00:41:21.698 --> 00:41:22.458]  It's to break your will.
[00:41:22.498 --> 00:41:25.199]  Like, hey, we're going to cut your kid's penis off when they're five years old.
[00:41:25.379 --> 00:41:26.820]  That's all exercise of power.
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:41.947]  And I remember going to events and things and having colonels and lieutenant colonels and former major generals and people, you know, at dinner going, they've set up CHICOM bases and Clinton's letting them set up bases.
[00:41:42.027 --> 00:41:44.348]  And I remember going, these guys are paranoid.
[00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:48.432]  And there's CHICOM bases in Mexico, and I'm like, yeah, right.
[00:41:50.173 --> 00:41:53.255]  And then the last decade, we learned they bought up all this farmland.
[00:41:53.915 --> 00:41:58.618]  The Chinese Communist Party is the biggest landowner after Bill Gates in the U.S., but he's the biggest private.
[00:41:58.678 --> 00:41:59.498]  They're bigger than him.
[00:42:00.119 --> 00:42:07.363]  And then you learn they're setting up all these antenna arrays and spy grids and 700-foot towers and jacking into the national security grid.
[00:42:08.543 --> 00:42:19.056]   I mean, if you drive around the edge of a military base, even one that's not that important, People are going to pull up and grab you and point guns at you and take you in and interrogate you.
[00:42:19.817 --> 00:42:20.437]  It's happened to me.
[00:42:21.878 --> 00:42:28.460]  I'm there covering, you know, information we've got about troops being killed during a test and, you know, things like that.
[00:42:29.201 --> 00:42:30.021]  Fort Sam Houston.
[00:42:34.122 --> 00:42:39.925]  But when you're the Communist Chinese and you build a base right next door with cameras pointed at the military base, it's fine with the FBI.
[00:42:41.746 --> 00:42:44.967]  Because the Justice Department tells the FBI who they can investigate.
[00:42:45.765 --> 00:42:48.345]  It's like the FBI can't investigate the 90,000 missing children.
[00:42:48.385 --> 00:42:48.966]  That's on record.
[00:42:49.486 --> 00:42:50.786]  I've had federal judges tell me to my face.
[00:42:51.426 --> 00:42:52.006]  Say, what do we do?
[00:42:52.026 --> 00:42:53.466]  I'm like, you're a federal judge.
[00:42:53.946 --> 00:42:55.347]  You're as smart as I am, at least.
[00:42:55.667 --> 00:42:57.027]  I don't... What do we do?
[00:42:57.047 --> 00:42:58.047]  Well, we draw attention to it.
[00:42:58.367 --> 00:43:00.708]  But we just keep drawing attention to this.
[00:43:03.068 --> 00:43:07.329]  So you should go to InfoWars.com and watch the full... I don't think they put the whole thing up.
[00:43:07.369 --> 00:43:08.549]  It's a lot of it is up there.
[00:43:09.409 --> 00:43:10.249]  I couldn't find the whole thing.
[00:43:10.289 --> 00:43:11.529]  I don't really watch mainstream TV.
[00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:13.390]  We're going to find it and air the whole thing in the next few days.
[00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:14.830]  But I watched a lot of it.
[00:43:15.948 --> 00:43:18.369]  Experts sound alarm over China's buying U.S.
[00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:20.150]  land near military bases, chilling.
[00:43:20.731 --> 00:43:24.193]  Fox Business, NBC News, foreign purchase of land near U.S.
[00:43:24.233 --> 00:43:26.614]  military bases would require government approval under new rules.
[00:43:28.115 --> 00:43:33.358]  Here's a big report in Forbes, why a secretive Chinese billionaire bought 140,000 acres of land in Texas.
[00:43:33.378 --> 00:43:34.278]  He's a Chinese general.
[00:43:35.859 --> 00:43:40.402]  So, and he built it where there's not high winds, where it doesn't even work.
[00:43:42.663 --> 00:43:45.365]  So, and this is all built now.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.061]  I've been down there.
[00:43:48.423 --> 00:43:52.970]  So here's just a short clip from Dr. Phil talking about this.
[00:43:52.789 --> 00:44:00.588]  us here it is.
[00:44:00.642 --> 00:44:01.984]  They're right up against this.
[00:44:02.164 --> 00:44:03.345]  How is this happening, Kyle?
[00:44:03.485 --> 00:44:04.426]  You're the expert here.
[00:44:04.506 --> 00:44:07.550]  There's one down in Texas, right there on the border near Del Rio.
[00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:08.230]  Right.
[00:44:09.031 --> 00:44:11.253]  Where it's actually a Chinese general.
[00:44:11.674 --> 00:44:19.982]  General Sun came in and bought over 100 square miles of land between our most active Air Force training base and our border.
[00:44:21.224 --> 00:44:24.145]  And he filed permits to put up windmills.
[00:44:24.665 --> 00:44:27.646]  It's an area on a scale of 1 to 10 that might have a wind factor of 3.5.
[00:44:28.586 --> 00:44:32.687]  If you and I were putting up a windmill, we'd put it up where it's an 8 or a 10, where there's some wind.
[00:44:32.847 --> 00:44:33.127]  Right.
[00:44:33.407 --> 00:44:35.168]  They want to put up windmills for two reasons.
[00:44:35.228 --> 00:44:36.828]  They want to connect directly to the U.S.
[00:44:36.888 --> 00:44:41.790]  grid so that they can upload malware to the grid and they can monitor the grid.
[00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:45.771]  And they also want to build these windmills 700 feet tall.
[00:44:45.851 --> 00:44:49.732]  Imagine a windmill that's almost as tall as the Washington Monument.
[00:44:50.433 --> 00:45:00.125]  And they can put cameras up there that map the horizon, and they can map the horizon with one square inch of clarity, right next to our largest Air Force military training base.
[00:45:00.345 --> 00:45:02.888]  Every Air Force pilot trains at Laughlin Air Force Base.
[00:45:03.428 --> 00:45:07.553]  They can map every person, every plane, every hypersonic that glides by.
[00:45:08.214 --> 00:45:13.560]  What it has to do is go through a process called CFIUS, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which the U.S.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:14.921]  Treasury is in charge of.
[00:45:15.281 --> 00:45:16.623]  And DOD is a piece of it.
[00:45:16.983 --> 00:45:21.388]  There are all these different departments that are part of CFIUS, but the U.S.
[00:45:21.428 --> 00:45:22.129]  Treasury runs it.
[00:45:22.449 --> 00:45:23.110]  Here's the problem.
[00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.970]  The U.S.
[00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:26.052]  Treasury is owned by Wall Street.
[00:45:26.913 --> 00:45:35.441]  And Wall Street can't wait to invest another dollar in the land of 1.3 billion people of puppy dogs and rainbows and make some more money in China.
[00:45:36.022 --> 00:45:40.366]  So whenever anything really comes down to it, if Treasury's in charge, we're in real trouble.
[00:45:41.026 --> 00:45:45.710]  And so all of these deals that you're showing here, many of them have just walked through CFIUS.
[00:45:47.032 --> 00:45:48.273]  So that's the problem.
[00:45:52.472 --> 00:45:52.812]  All right.
[00:45:52.832 --> 00:45:53.613]  And there's a lot more.
[00:45:53.633 --> 00:45:54.334]  It gets a lot worse.
[00:45:54.374 --> 00:45:55.935]  And by the way, it's worse than they were saying there.
[00:45:55.955 --> 00:45:57.236]  They were being very conservative.
[00:45:57.436 --> 00:45:59.337]  So let's expand on that now.
[00:46:00.238 --> 00:46:02.540]  You have the NSA wired into the Five Eyes.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.281]  You have Communist China wired into that.
[00:46:05.702 --> 00:46:07.043]  They're wired into the power grid.
[00:46:07.564 --> 00:46:09.725]  I mean, that's infrastructure protection.
[00:46:10.166 --> 00:46:21.094]  If the local police in the country, and they should be trained to this, if they catch you at a key infrastructure facility breaking in and you're up in the equipment, they're authorized to shoot you in the back.
[00:46:22.918 --> 00:46:29.864]  Well, the Chi-Coms don't need to go climb into one to shut off, say, all the power in Texas that would cut off power across the country in many areas.
[00:46:32.306 --> 00:46:34.788]  To chain reaction, they're just jacked into it.
[00:46:35.729 --> 00:46:38.732]  Now, I guarantee you, if I had billions of dollars, I'd try to go get a permit and do that.
[00:46:38.772 --> 00:46:41.774]  They wouldn't let me in because of my political background, because I'm a loyal American.
[00:46:44.056 --> 00:46:45.978]  That's what the whole deplatforming is about, the debanking.
[00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:47.750]  I can barely get a bank account.
[00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:54.454]  But if you're a communist Chinese general, you can waltz in next to a military base and buy the land all around and aim cameras in on it.
[00:46:55.595 --> 00:46:55.875]  They can.
[00:46:57.016 --> 00:46:58.057]  These cameras are so good.
[00:46:58.077 --> 00:47:07.083]  These HD cameras, when the atmospherics are right, they can literally look at the antenna on a ant's head.
[00:47:09.104 --> 00:47:15.028]  And imagine those cameras are zooming in just miles away on those secretive military equipment.
[00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:18.031]  You know what's being loaded on the planes?
[00:47:18.812 --> 00:47:19.092]  Everything.
[00:47:19.312 --> 00:47:23.435]  They got acoustics, they're listening, and our government just lets them do it.
[00:47:25.376 --> 00:47:29.399]  And I wanted to show you, you've seen them, there's thousands of videos, I see like 50 a day without even trying to look.
[00:47:29.559 --> 00:47:30.159]  I don't watch them.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:38.725]  Of the FBI going to people's houses, I watch some of them, a few of them, they're like, well you, you made a post on this, you didn't threaten anybody, but we'd like to come in and talk to you about your post.
[00:47:38.966 --> 00:47:40.907]  You don't like Obama very much, or Biden.
[00:47:42.085 --> 00:47:48.568]  They got them running around everywhere while they're human trafficking, sex slavery, fentanyl, Chycom bases.
[00:47:48.728 --> 00:47:50.069]  It's a joke, people.
[00:47:51.089 --> 00:47:52.730]  And Trump is in a criminal trial.
[00:47:54.811 --> 00:47:56.211]  So he can't go around the country.
[00:47:56.251 --> 00:47:58.812]  The judge is ordering him to stay there or he'll jail him.
[00:47:58.852 --> 00:48:00.313]  I think Trump should call his bluff.
[00:48:01.534 --> 00:48:02.894]  Time for a constitutional crisis.
[00:48:03.154 --> 00:48:04.335]  Time for the Supreme Court to rule.
[00:48:04.355 --> 00:48:06.216]  Oh, and what's he on trial for?
[00:48:06.536 --> 00:48:07.236]  Election meddling.
[00:48:08.036 --> 00:48:08.136]  From 2016.
[00:48:11.161 --> 00:48:13.743]  Well, they openly take him off the ballot and election medal.
[00:48:14.244 --> 00:48:15.344]  But here's the next big piece.
[00:48:15.925 --> 00:48:16.565]  Terrifying!
[00:48:16.646 --> 00:48:22.550]  FISA bill set to include vast new surveillance powers, forcing businesses to become NSA spies.
[00:48:23.311 --> 00:48:24.172]  I've gone to look at the bill.
[00:48:25.052 --> 00:48:25.853]  It's passed the House.
[00:48:25.893 --> 00:48:27.214]  Now they're adding crap in the Senate.
[00:48:29.116 --> 00:48:30.577]  Another big article from Zero Hedge.
[00:48:30.597 --> 00:48:33.699]  The NSA just days away from taking over the Internet, warns Ed Snowden.
[00:48:35.121 --> 00:48:38.223]  Let's go ahead and play Gregory's latest report on this.
[00:48:38.283 --> 00:48:39.044]  It's very important.
[00:48:39.725 --> 00:48:43.590]  It's being posted on The Real Alex Jones, or if it isn't already there, I want to make sure it's there.
[00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:45.972]  This is a very important report.
[00:48:46.453 --> 00:48:51.338]  Let me give you the title of the report so you can find it at Band.Video and The Real Alex Jones and share the hell out of it.
[00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:53.981]  Small U.S.
[00:48:54.021 --> 00:48:56.284]  businesses to be forced to serve as NSA spies.
[00:48:57.418 --> 00:49:00.379]  That doesn't even deal with the spying issue, just the fact you're being indentured.
[00:49:00.659 --> 00:49:02.220]  That's the same thing as quartering troops.
[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:08.922]  To the bill of rights that they can't quarter troops in your house, make you pay for the board and food of military.
[00:49:09.462 --> 00:49:19.806]  But now as a business, you gotta pay to hook their systems in and sign off on them spying on everything you do, and your employees do, and your customers do.
[00:49:20.306 --> 00:49:21.266]  Here it is.
[00:49:21.266 --> 00:49:28.706]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:49:28.706 --> 00:49:35.706]   An absolutely indispensable tool that Congress can give us in our fight against foreign adversaries
[00:49:35.706 --> 00:49:41.706]   is the reauthorization of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
[00:49:41.288 --> 00:49:49.374]  It is critical in securing our nation and we are in crunch time with our 702 authority set to expire next week.
[00:49:50.595 --> 00:50:03.805]   So let me be clear, failure to reauthorize 702 Or gutting it with some new kind of warrant requirement would be dangerous and put Americans' lives at risk.
[00:50:04.325 --> 00:50:12.991]  Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was enacted to make it easier for the government to address foreign terrorist threats.
[00:50:13.551 --> 00:50:23.018]  Targeting Americans is prohibited, but intelligence agencies have used Section 702 to spy on hundreds of thousands of Americans every year.
[00:50:23.518 --> 00:50:25.860]  And this week it's looking to get a lot worse.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:35.069]  Elizabeth Goytien of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice does a great job of explaining it and sounding the alarm.
[00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:45.561]  Buried in the Section 702 reauthorization bill passed by the House on Friday is the biggest expansion of domestic surveillance since the Patriot Act.
[00:50:46.281 --> 00:50:58.927]  Under current law, the government can compel electronic communications service providers that have direct access to communications to assist the NSA in conducting Section 702 surveillance.
[00:50:59.347 --> 00:51:10.092]  Companies like Verizon and Google must turn over the communications of targets, which officially must be foreigners overseas, but this has been abused to spy on Americans.
[00:51:10.712 --> 00:51:25.434]  By changing the definition of Electronic Communications Surveillance Provider, an amendment offered by House Intel Committee leaders and passed by the House, vastly expands the universe of entities that can be compelled to assist the NSA.
[00:51:26.215 --> 00:51:40.483]  If the bill becomes law, any company or individual that provides any service whatsoever may be forced to assist in NSA surveillance, as long as they have access to equipment on which communications are transmitted or stored.
[00:51:41.323 --> 00:51:51.447]  When the amendment was first unveiled, civil liberties advocates noted that the provision would encompass hotels, libraries, and coffee shops, and so they were excluded.
[00:51:51.927 --> 00:51:53.527]  But the vast majority of U.S.
[00:51:53.567 --> 00:52:06.052]  businesses remain fair game, including barbershops, laundromats, fitness centers, hardware stores, and any small business that provides Wi-Fi to their customers via routers.
[00:52:06.872 --> 00:52:19.455]  It also includes commercial landlords that rent out offices, which would target journalists, lawyers, financial advisors, healthcare providers, and anyone renting commercial office space.
[00:52:20.035 --> 00:52:35.538]  The amendment even includes service providers who come into our homes, such as house cleaners, plumbers, and IT service providers, all of whom could be forced to serve as surrogate spies and be required to give the NSA direct access.
[00:52:36.378 --> 00:52:38.779]  And none of them would be allowed to tell anyone.
[00:52:39.219 --> 00:52:43.761]  They would be under a gag order and would face heavy penalties if they failed to comply.
[00:52:44.441 --> 00:52:55.064]  Having wholesale access to domestic communications, the NSA would then be on the honor system to retain only the communications of approved foreign targets.
[00:52:55.504 --> 00:52:59.286]  And we know from past experience that they cannot be trusted to do this.
[00:53:00.146 --> 00:53:02.628]  The Senate is scheduled to vote on the bill this week.
[00:53:03.148 --> 00:53:14.177]  Section 702 expires on April 19th, but the Biden administration has obtained FISA court approval to continue Section 702 surveillance until April of 2025.
[00:53:16.258 --> 00:53:21.582]  Call your senators now and tell them to block the Everyone is a Spy surveillance bill.
[00:53:22.523 --> 00:53:25.025]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:53:26.664 --> 00:53:29.365]  So they are pressing us into service.
[00:53:29.385 --> 00:53:32.587]  They're already doing it, but they want everybody to tacitly agree to it.
[00:53:32.667 --> 00:53:33.887]  All the cars are tracked now.
[00:53:34.328 --> 00:53:35.088]  All the new cars.
[00:53:35.428 --> 00:53:37.649]  California's introduced bills to ban all the old cars.
[00:53:38.249 --> 00:53:39.290]  This is a criminal takeover.
[00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:41.751]  We're going to start the next hour with Julian Assange's brother.
[00:53:41.771 --> 00:53:43.872]  This is going to be historic, very important.
[00:53:44.392 --> 00:53:45.053]  Please stay with us.

[00:54:20.445 --> 00:54:21.346]  Major discounts there.
[00:54:21.686 --> 00:54:23.788]  But the new sale is Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:54:32.356 --> 00:54:35.539]  So what I really want to ask you to do is pray for myself and the crew and my family.
[00:54:35.899 --> 00:54:36.640]  That's number one.
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:37.421]  I want that.
[00:54:37.501 --> 00:54:37.921]  I need that.
[00:54:38.302 --> 00:54:39.343]  It's your prayer that's doing it.
[00:54:39.643 --> 00:54:40.524]  That's why this surfaced.
[00:54:40.544 --> 00:54:41.404]  That's why this happened.
[00:54:41.424 --> 00:54:42.846]  I need the prayer.
[00:54:43.857 --> 00:54:51.406]  Then I need you to take the articles, the videos, the posts we make at Real Alex Jones, recopy them, share them, post them yourself, do whatever, just get it out there!
[00:54:52.247 --> 00:54:52.868]  And I need you...
[00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:58.232]  To go to InfoWarsStore.com and I need you to get great products you already need.
[00:54:58.252 --> 00:54:59.552]  There's a bunch of sales going.

[00:55:29.944 --> 00:55:30.725]  TurboForce.
[00:55:31.105 --> 00:55:36.006]  We'll be right back.
[00:55:38.867 --> 00:55:41.709]  Mr. President to Iran in this moment.
[00:55:42.569 --> 00:55:42.829]  Don't.
[00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:52.247]  The globalists, like Bertrand Russell and others, proposed, this is public, using neutron bombs to depopulate the Earth.
[00:55:53.008 --> 00:55:58.493]  Because they don't destroy the cities, they don't destroy the farmland, there's no residual radiation to speak of.
[00:55:58.833 --> 00:56:08.123]  These troops, forming a special task force, were the first in our Army's history to engage in a tactical exercise supported by live nuclear firepower.
[00:56:09.224 --> 00:56:18.190]  The reactor is programmed, and the subject positioned, to receive a mid-head dose of approximately 10,000 rads of mixed gamma and neutron radiation.
[00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:24.974]  And, within a matter, uh, let's just consider it way less than an hour, you'll be dead.
[00:56:24.994 --> 00:56:29.217]  Just extrapolating that out, if Iran hits Israel hard enough, and if the U.S.
[00:56:29.237 --> 00:56:32.778]   hits Iran back when they counter-strike, And Russia gets involved.
[00:56:33.499 --> 00:56:39.301]  Don't be surprised if all the major cities of Iran and their military bases get hit with neutron bombs.
[00:56:39.481 --> 00:56:43.803]  No secret that we have the technical capabilities required to manufacture a nuclear bomb.
[00:56:44.043 --> 00:56:46.824]  A red line should be drawn right here.
[00:56:47.824 --> 00:56:52.246]  Before Iran gets to a point where it's a few months away or a few weeks away.
[00:56:53.783 --> 00:56:57.424]  From amassing enough enriched uranium to make a nuclear weapon.
[00:56:57.704 --> 00:57:15.988]  I think the real agenda that we're going to see unfold is Israel going into a narcissistic hysteria and a delusional pride that only Israel and Israelis can generate that is going to lead them down this reckless path of escalation.
[00:57:16.668 --> 00:57:32.376]  And I do see the Israelis launching attacks in the United States, Operation Gladio, false flags to try and blame Iran, thinking that we can be fooled, goaded, lured, or tricked into a war against Iran, a military response.
[00:57:32.616 --> 00:57:35.698]  What role in the Middle East, again, does Israel play in this?
[00:57:37.043 --> 00:57:42.747]  Israel was created as the instrument to bring about the Battle of Armageddon and the fulfillment of prophecy.
[00:57:43.127 --> 00:57:51.653]  A war that will be so terrible where nuclear weapons will be used so that the American citizens and the other people in the world will get down on their knees and beg for no more war.
[00:57:51.673 --> 00:57:52.674]  What is the answer to that?
[00:57:52.694 --> 00:57:59.059]  They're going to be told the only way we can guarantee no more war is if we destroy the sovereignty of nations.
[00:57:59.779 --> 00:58:03.161]  There was already a heightened risk of violence in the United States before October 7th.
[00:58:03.021 --> 00:58:08.561]   And the usual suspects, these criminals like Christopher Wray and the rest of these traitors
[00:58:08.561 --> 00:58:14.321]   in Congress are more than happy to back it because it means a perennial authoritarian
[00:58:14.321 --> 00:58:15.321]  police state.
[00:58:15.321 --> 00:58:21.400]   There was already a heightened risk of violence in the United States before October 7th.
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:28.481]   Since then, we've seen a rogues gallery of foreign terrorist organizations call for attacks
[00:58:28.481 --> 00:58:30.961]  against Americans and our allies.
[00:58:30.996 --> 00:58:33.658]  When I think about the USA, it should burn!
[00:58:33.718 --> 00:58:34.959]  Death to America!
[00:58:34.798 --> 00:58:36.798]  It can be left to or down with.
[00:58:36.798 --> 00:58:37.798]  So...
[00:58:37.798 --> 00:58:39.798]  Can we get a "Marimba Amrica"?
[00:58:39.798 --> 00:58:41.798]  We can get a "Marimba Amrica".
[00:58:41.798 --> 00:58:43.798]  "Marimba Amrica"!
[00:58:43.798 --> 00:58:45.798]  "Marimba Amrica"!
[00:58:45.798 --> 00:58:51.798]   The point is, is that they've not been in offensive posture, but now they're not backing down.
[00:58:52.505 --> 00:59:02.707]  For the first time ever, Iran has struck and fired very sophisticated multiple re-entry device missiles that are designed to carry atomic weapons in a clear message to Israel.
[00:59:02.747 --> 00:59:06.327]  I don't think you disagree, but nobody else is saying this, that we can hit you with our weapons.
[00:59:06.868 --> 00:59:08.648]  This takes it into a whole other ballgame.
[00:59:10.585 --> 00:59:16.409]  They could launch another wave of drones a hundred times as large as the one that they launched.
[00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:19.692]  That's how many missiles and drones they have.
[00:59:20.293 --> 00:59:25.137]  They have very hyper-accurate missiles and drones.
[00:59:25.577 --> 00:59:28.920]  The Iranian technology is very advanced.
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:37.503]  And for those who don't know, they can have the atomic warheads detonate at 50,000 feet when no air defenses are even set to take them out.
[00:59:37.883 --> 00:59:39.983]  They're set to take them out at 20,000, 10,000 feet.
[00:59:40.424 --> 00:59:46.165]  Just the EMP event of that will knock out all the power and electrical systems of the defense systems.
[00:59:46.245 --> 00:59:48.926]  And then the next wave comes in and you can't stop them.
[00:59:48.946 --> 00:59:51.427]  Then they detonate at 1,000, 2,000 feet.
[00:59:51.967 --> 00:59:54.408]  And I think Iran is ready for nuclear war.
[00:59:54.888 --> 00:59:55.568]  So is Russia.
[00:59:55.608 --> 00:59:56.989]  This is so dangerous.
[00:59:57.629 --> 01:00:11.233]  If Israel is so reckless and suicidal and stupid as to launch a major attack against Iran, it'll only react in Russia, stepping, closing ranks, giving Iran whatever it needs, quietly.
[01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:13.574]  China doing the same thing, quietly.
[01:00:14.034 --> 01:00:19.536]  And Iran will then do another counter-strike, only this time, it may be a hundred times worse.
[01:00:19.516 --> 01:00:24.796]   and then say, "If you keep this going, we'll hit you a thousand times worse."
[01:00:24.796 --> 01:00:29.916]   Please stand by for further details. We will turn you now to your regularly scheduled program.
[01:00:29.916 --> 01:00:39.034]   There is nothing more frustrating to me, whether it comes to news or anything else we're doing,
[01:00:39.034 --> 01:00:43.836]   than to know I'm telling the truth and to know they'll just listen to me and take action.
[01:00:44.087 --> 01:00:44.868]  It will change your life.
[01:00:45.751 --> 01:00:49.112]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have two great products that have been sold out for a long time.
[01:00:49.472 --> 01:00:52.233]  They're now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:00:52.854 --> 01:00:56.295]  X3 is the highest quality iodine, the missing link.
[01:00:56.755 --> 01:00:58.676]  It is back in stock, 40% off.
[01:00:58.836 --> 01:01:04.378]  And so is TurboForce, 10-hour clean energy, naturally released.
[01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:05.338]  It is amazing.
[01:01:05.759 --> 01:01:07.999]  Both of these products fund the InfoWar.
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:11.161]  So they could be placebo and it'd still be great if you fund the InfoWar.
[01:01:11.461 --> 01:01:11.921]  They're not.
[01:01:12.541 --> 01:01:15.462]  If you'll just try TurboForce, you'll see the results in 30 minutes.
[01:01:15.782 --> 01:01:18.083]  Incredible energy for 10 hours without the letdown.
[01:01:18.463 --> 01:01:24.224]  But if you will just take X3 on average for about two weeks, you will see amazing results because it's the missing link.
[01:01:24.884 --> 01:01:31.106]  X3 and TurboForce, both discounted now for a limited time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:01:31.946 --> 01:01:38.568]  We're now into our number two, and Julian Assange's brother, Gabriel Shempton, is our guest.
[01:01:39.943 --> 01:01:47.406]  Here's Joe Biden just days ago saying he's considering dropping charges against political prisoner Julian Assange.
[01:01:49.826 --> 01:01:54.608]  President Biden, do you have a response to Australia's request that you end Julian Assange's prosecution?
[01:01:56.289 --> 01:01:58.489]  I didn't hear you.
[01:01:58.509 --> 01:02:03.171]  Do you have a response to Australia's request that you end Julian Assange's prosecution?
[01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:12.990]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:26.251]   We've been hearing for weeks that the Biden administration is considering this,
[01:02:26.251 --> 01:02:27.791]  but we know Biden is pretty much a puppet.
[01:02:27.973 --> 01:02:30.914]  But to have him say it himself is encouraging.
[01:02:30.934 --> 01:02:35.836]  One of Trump's greatest failures was not hardening or dropping charges against Julian Assange.
[01:02:35.876 --> 01:02:39.837]  He admits the CIA threatened him if he did in his war with the deep state.
[01:02:42.335 --> 01:02:44.318]  Gabriel Shempton is his brother.
[01:02:44.759 --> 01:02:47.422]  Julian Assange took the name of his stepfather.
[01:02:48.063 --> 01:02:54.212]  Gabriel Shempton is a film producer at the Shempton House, an advocate for his brother and prison journalist and hero.
[01:02:54.232 --> 01:02:56.796]  He's also a publisher.
[01:02:58.095 --> 01:03:01.196]  He's at Gabriel Shempton on X. One word, Gabriel Shempton.
[01:03:01.216 --> 01:03:02.297]  We'll put that up on screen.
[01:03:02.317 --> 01:03:04.617]  You should definitely follow him there.
[01:03:05.318 --> 01:03:17.562]  Before we go to Gabriel, I wanted to play a clip of Julian Assange more than a decade ago before he was on self-induced prison and now many years in solitary confinement in prison for no crime.
[01:03:18.502 --> 01:03:22.524]  And here is Assange explaining the goal of Afghanistan is endless war.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:28.363]  Because the goal is not to completely subjugate Afghanistan.
[01:03:28.784 --> 01:03:43.536]  The goal is to use Afghanistan to wash money out of the tax bases of the United States, out of the tax bases of European countries, through Afghanistan, and back into the hands of a transnational security alliance.
[01:03:43.736 --> 01:03:44.497]  That is the goal.
[01:03:45.418 --> 01:03:50.282]  The goal is to have an endless war, not a successful war.
[01:03:52.136 --> 01:03:55.101]  All right, so I'm very honored to have his brother on.
[01:03:55.121 --> 01:03:57.245]  I really admire Julian Assange.
[01:03:57.746 --> 01:04:03.395]  He has been through even more hell than myself, times 100, more than even President Trump.
[01:04:03.414 --> 01:04:09.735]   what you want about me or Trump, we are targeted by the same deep state. So there are countless
[01:04:09.735 --> 01:04:14.295]   political prisoners now here in this country and around the world as the West goes pure,
[01:04:14.295 --> 01:04:20.933]   totalitarian and mask off, gloves off. And so I think it's important to review what happened
[01:04:20.933 --> 01:04:25.974]   to Julian Assange and how he's vindicated with everything in the WikiLeaks they confirm is real
[01:04:25.974 --> 01:04:28.215]  and now what's come out since.
[01:04:28.437 --> 01:04:33.178]  Obviously Edward Snowden who hasn't paid the same price but they would have if they could have gotten him.
[01:04:34.138 --> 01:04:44.381]  And then also talk about currently what we can do to get Biden to do the right thing and it would be a political win for him is base.
[01:04:45.802 --> 01:04:50.826]  One of the few things they have right is that Assange is a good guy, not a bad guy.
[01:04:51.707 --> 01:04:52.908]  So this is a big deal.
[01:04:53.248 --> 01:04:57.311]  What do we do for Assange in solitary confinement right now?
[01:04:57.371 --> 01:04:58.992]  Because we are all Julian Assange.
[01:04:59.573 --> 01:05:01.354]  They're trying to get through him to get to us.
[01:05:01.394 --> 01:05:03.516]  That is not just something people say.
[01:05:03.596 --> 01:05:04.297]  That's the truth.
[01:05:06.516 --> 01:05:07.497]  I really appreciate you coming on.
[01:05:08.197 --> 01:05:21.564]  You can start wherever you want, but maybe about you and your brother, maybe why your brother did this, or humanizing him, what he's been through, how they set him up with the sex operatives, where all this is going, where he currently is.
[01:05:22.324 --> 01:05:41.897]   You can start anywhere you want, but I do, during this 50 minutes we have left with you, also want to go back and look at some of the incredible things that WikiLeaks did to expose the fact That our government knew there were no WMDs, our government's involved in so much other illegal spying, political operations.
[01:05:42.137 --> 01:05:48.018]  And you look at Daniel Ellsberg, who I've interviewed many times before he died, he was a hero for exposing.
[01:05:48.038 --> 01:05:51.098]  And he didn't get in trouble because it was the right thing to do.
[01:05:51.479 --> 01:05:55.039]  They knew the Vietnam War had been lost by 1968.
[01:05:55.299 --> 01:05:58.080]  They kept the war going for seven more years.
[01:05:59.341 --> 01:06:00.723]  As a money laundering operation.
[01:06:00.763 --> 01:06:04.788]  So how is your brother different than Daniel Ellsberg?
[01:06:04.848 --> 01:06:07.711]  He was in the Pentagon, but whistleblowers are protected.
[01:06:07.911 --> 01:06:09.173]  Your brother was a journalist.
[01:06:09.213 --> 01:06:11.175]  So, Gabriel, I've kind of set the table.
[01:06:11.536 --> 01:06:12.857]  We didn't talk before you came on.
[01:06:12.877 --> 01:06:13.838]  You just agreed to come on.
[01:06:14.179 --> 01:06:15.240]  You can begin wherever you want.
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:15.881]  Thank you so much.
[01:06:17.779 --> 01:06:19.940]  Yeah, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:21.240]  Good to be here.
[01:06:22.721 --> 01:06:30.884]  Look, I guess we could go back, you know, Julian, ever since, you know, he's 11 years older than me, he's my older brother.
[01:06:32.244 --> 01:06:42.872]   And ever since, you know, we sort of got to know each other when I was in my late teens, and I've always had a lot of admiration for what He was up to the work that he was doing.
[01:06:42.892 --> 01:06:49.293]  Even in those early days, he was looking at ways to, how can we use technology?
[01:06:49.333 --> 01:07:09.918]   How can we use encryption to even make a cryptography program called Rubber Hose, which was a cryptography program that would allow, say, if you had some secret information or some files that you needed to, that you were a whistleblower or journalist and you were being searched, Alright, he's in Australia.
[01:07:09.818 --> 01:07:14.457]  that this program would allow you to hide that information.
[01:07:14.457 --> 01:07:20.577]   And if you were being tortured, it would allow you to open a layer of the encryption
[01:07:20.577 --> 01:07:24.057]   and your torturers would assume that that's the information that you had,
[01:07:24.057 --> 01:07:28.336]   but it was also keep the information that was important safe.
[01:07:28.336 --> 01:07:32.336]   And you would be able to escape with that information and share it with the world.
[01:07:32.336 --> 01:07:36.378]  All right, he's in Australia.
[01:07:36.378 --> 01:07:38.177]  His Skype broke up.
[01:07:38.177 --> 01:07:44.018]   Let's reconnect with Gabriel right now and get him on so he can recap what he was saying
[01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:52.418]   and start off with where his brother began to wake up, what got him politically involved.
[01:07:52.723 --> 01:08:03.731]  I think where I was going was that he's always been using technology, his skills as a technologist to educate people, get access to information, to truthful information.
[01:08:04.725 --> 01:08:10.591]  And bring that to the public and protect sources and protect journalists in the process.
[01:08:11.472 --> 01:08:16.117]  And so that's in 2006 was when he started Wikileaks.
[01:08:16.858 --> 01:08:44.698]   There's a famous white paper, the famous Wikileaks white paper now, which is called Conspiracy and Government, which outlined the It really outlined the perceived problems with these conspiracies that exist within government, conspiracies between the security elite, the media corporations and government to govern.
[01:08:45.778 --> 01:08:51.481]  How to deconstruct those conspiracies was by increasing their secrecy cost.
[01:08:52.001 --> 01:09:00.865]  So by increasing the secrecy cost of these conspiracies, they would become more and more inefficient and start to break down.
[01:09:00.885 --> 01:09:08.085]   And it was really that white paper that led to the development of Wikileaks, this combination
[01:09:08.085 --> 01:09:17.364]   of jurisdictional arbitrage in a press freedom sense, combined with encryption and using
[01:09:17.364 --> 01:09:37.045]   the architecture of the internet to make this Wikileaks website that we're talking about
[01:09:24.744 --> 01:09:25.824]  It was uncensorable.
[01:09:26.244 --> 01:09:27.665]  It couldn't be taken down.
[01:09:27.725 --> 01:09:32.766]  And even to this day, the WikiLeaks archives exist online.
[01:09:32.806 --> 01:09:43.568]  But Julian really believes that through knowledge is the only way that our societies can right themselves, can make themselves better.
[01:09:44.208 --> 01:10:05.859]   And so that's essentially why he developed WikiLeaks, so that we as people, as humans, are able to Find out what our governments or these institutions are doing in our name and then correct course if they're not doing something that we don't want or that we believe is morally corrupt or exposing their crimes.
[01:10:05.919 --> 01:10:14.265]  So being able to get that knowledge to people so that we can make a better society for ourselves.
[01:10:14.325 --> 01:10:23.738]   And that's really what I think Julian What I was always concerned about is how do we make the world better for the people who are living in it?
[01:10:25.371 --> 01:10:28.173]  And fundamentally, I think that's why they feared your brother so much.
[01:10:28.253 --> 01:10:34.497]  So professional, doing such a great job, betting everything, nothing he ever put out turned out to be fake or false.
[01:10:34.557 --> 01:10:38.019]  We know the famous Karl Rove stuff with Bush Jr.
[01:10:38.059 --> 01:10:44.964]  was to put fake stuff in a real file to discredit all his other real, you know, horrible activities in the Texas Air National Guard.
[01:10:45.384 --> 01:10:46.404]  That's a classic tactic.
[01:10:46.765 --> 01:10:53.244]   Your brother and his team was able to navigate that over and over again and had such incredible credibility.
[01:10:53.244 --> 01:10:55.604]  Why do you think they fear your brother so much?
[01:10:55.604 --> 01:11:00.684]   And if you'd like, just to talk about kind of the compendium of what he's done, some of the biggest things he did.
[01:11:00.684 --> 01:11:07.045]   And let's talk about him being set up and where he is now and what we can do to try to get him finally to freedom.
[01:11:07.045 --> 01:11:15.525]   Well, Julian was this, you know, he was a pioneer of this technique of using, you know,
[01:11:15.525 --> 01:11:21.444]   encryption, this architecture of the internet to bring more transparency to governments around the world.
[01:11:21.308 --> 01:11:26.870]  And he was exposing corrupt people and they couldn't control him.
[01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:35.316]  You know, WikiLeaks wasn't under the control of these corporate institutions that exist in the media landscape now.
[01:11:35.936 --> 01:11:40.299]  There was no advertising revenue, so there was no control from advertisers.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:12:00.248]   And he was able to, I guess, almost copying the techniques that were used by the intelligence community to play stories around the world, he would use those techniques as well to bring publishers all together to publish, collaborate and publish
[01:12:00.248 --> 01:12:03.768]  this truthful information in collaboration with Wikileaks.
[01:12:03.768 --> 01:12:15.149]   And so it was really a sort of this watershed moment in history where the control over the media landscape was lost
[01:12:15.149 --> 01:12:15.768]  for a time.
[01:12:15.768 --> 01:12:16.768]  You know, they would--
[01:12:16.872 --> 01:12:22.234]  There was no control over the corporate media landscape in that effect.
[01:12:23.214 --> 01:12:26.876]  These documents were on Wikileaks for everyone to see.
[01:12:27.496 --> 01:12:28.636]  They couldn't be spun.
[01:12:29.377 --> 01:12:31.057]  Julian called it scientific journalism.
[01:12:31.578 --> 01:12:52.153]   When you do a scientific study, you have the data to back it up and it can be peer-reviewed But what Wikileaks did was similar, that they would put the leaked document up and so that you could peer review journalism, you could peer review these journalistic articles, see where the spin was, see where the bias was, see what was true or false.
[01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:58.656]  And I think that's why he is so feared, is because he exposed the crimes and he was uncensorable.
[01:12:59.417 --> 01:13:00.077]  Well, that's right.
[01:13:00.177 --> 01:13:01.718]  And he beat them at their own game.
[01:13:01.758 --> 01:13:08.881]  But instead of lying, he told the truth, which really shows how it's a paper tiger, this military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned about.
[01:13:09.201 --> 01:13:14.383]  If there is any checks and balances, any media doing their job, it would stop this system.
[01:13:14.403 --> 01:13:16.703]  But, oh, they're so scared of checks and balances.
[01:13:16.764 --> 01:13:18.184]  You're hosting right now.
[01:13:18.284 --> 01:13:18.884]  You're the expert.
[01:13:18.924 --> 01:13:19.465]  You're his brother.
[01:13:21.149 --> 01:13:25.590]  But people never really talk about his childhood or him or what makes him tick.
[01:13:25.631 --> 01:13:39.015]  Maybe spend a few minutes on your brother and why he's been so unbreakable under incredible solitary confinement, which they report is the worst form of long-term torture, and then currently where he is and what we can do for him.
[01:13:41.849 --> 01:13:59.281]  Well, yeah, I, you know, Julian, I, you know, every time I can't, I'm in so much admiration for Julian and his strength and his, you know, his compassion, his thoughtfulness and, you know, he's a gentle genius.
[01:14:00.121 --> 01:14:06.365]  He's a gentle genius who just wanted or wants to bring more justice to the world.
[01:14:06.785 --> 01:14:12.249]   And that's always been, I think, at the core of the things That he's been doing.
[01:14:12.269 --> 01:14:22.416]  I mean, he's been in now in a prison for five years and before that seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy and under house arrest before that.
[01:14:22.456 --> 01:14:26.478]  So we're looking at 14 years where he's been detained one way or another.
[01:14:26.498 --> 01:14:30.341]  And these last five years have been incredibly tough on him.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:40.841]   He's been in a 2m by 3m cell most of his time, 21 to 22 hours a day, in a maximum security prison.
[01:14:40.967 --> 01:14:43.267]  He's not charged with anything in the United Kingdom.
[01:14:43.287 --> 01:14:45.108]  He's not serving a sentence.
[01:14:45.148 --> 01:14:46.208]  He hasn't been convicted.
[01:14:46.668 --> 01:14:48.329]  He has never even got a parking fine.
[01:14:49.069 --> 01:14:57.291]  And he's being kept there solely at the request of the US Department of Justice in relation to this extradition.
[01:14:58.266 --> 01:15:00.428]  And it's been wearing him down.
[01:15:00.548 --> 01:15:13.018]  In 2019, when he first went to the prison, there's a UN special rapporteur on torture, Nils Melser, went to see Julian in the prison and took two expert doctors there with him.
[01:15:13.498 --> 01:15:21.825]  And these are doctors who usually go to these third world countries or places where there's authoritarian regimes.
[01:15:22.385 --> 01:15:26.889]  And assess situations there where there might be someone undergoing some type of torture.
[01:15:27.329 --> 01:15:36.016]  But they were going into a prison in London to assess whether Julian was suffering the effects of torture.
[01:15:36.036 --> 01:15:42.982]  And those independent experts found that Julian was suffering the effects of psychological torture.
[01:15:43.542 --> 01:15:46.223]  And his situation hasn't changed.
[01:15:46.723 --> 01:15:50.705]  So that psychological torture continues to this day.
[01:15:50.765 --> 01:15:59.688]  And Nils Melzer, the UN Special Rapporteur, the former one, actually called it a slow-motion murder before our very eyes.
[01:16:00.208 --> 01:16:05.130]  That's what is going on, what is happening to Julian right now in that prison.
[01:16:05.170 --> 01:16:06.210]  It's a slow-motion murder.
[01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:14.705]   I went to see him at the end of February inside the prison It's really heartbreaking.
[01:16:17.068 --> 01:16:24.217]  It's heartbreaking to see him locked up like that for just publishing truthful information.
[01:16:25.244 --> 01:16:26.825]  You know, wanting to help people.
[01:16:27.405 --> 01:16:31.126]  This is the punishment that he's receiving and it's wearing him down.
[01:16:31.246 --> 01:16:34.828]  You know, he's in a very, very delicate position health-wise.
[01:16:36.108 --> 01:16:44.031]  You know, it just really upsets me actually to talk about it, to talk about going and seeing him there in the prison.
[01:16:44.051 --> 01:16:48.802]   Now, I think What people can do in the U.S.
[01:16:48.862 --> 01:16:57.189]  is, you know, there's a resolution before the House, the House Resolution 934, and we're encouraging all the supporters across the U.S.
[01:16:57.589 --> 01:17:01.072]  to contact their representative, ask them to sign on to that resolution.
[01:17:01.112 --> 01:17:02.613]  We're trying to get 20 co-sponsors.
[01:17:03.153 --> 01:17:05.515]  I think we're up to 11 at the moment.
[01:17:05.755 --> 01:17:08.357]  It's a bipartisan resolution.
[01:17:08.417 --> 01:17:12.641]  So, yeah, taking part in that and that lobbying effort I think is really key.
[01:17:13.401 --> 01:17:36.115]   We've had some great success with these types of lobbying of representatives and I think that will send a message to the Biden administration that there is a lot of support for this prosecution being dropped and that the political cost Of pursuing Julian actually outweighs the cost of them dropping it.
[01:17:36.195 --> 01:17:41.936]  So I think that's what really needs to happen to change Julian's situation.
[01:17:41.976 --> 01:17:51.278]  But at the end of the day, it's up to the DOJ and they have to make that final decision to withdraw the charges and bring them to an end.
[01:17:56.132 --> 01:17:58.073]  Now, I've been asking some of the questions here.
[01:17:58.333 --> 01:18:00.733]  Again, Julian Assange's brother is here with us right now.
[01:18:01.374 --> 01:18:03.114]  Gabriel, you've got the floor.
[01:18:03.254 --> 01:18:04.415]  Where do you want to go with this?
[01:18:04.535 --> 01:18:06.155]  Because there's so much people want to know.
[01:18:06.215 --> 01:18:07.015]  I just thought of this.
[01:18:07.696 --> 01:18:11.377]  I'm going to post on X here in a moment on Real Alex Jones to my listeners.
[01:18:11.757 --> 01:18:18.599]  If you have questions for Gabriel Shempton, Julian Assange's brother, we'll take some of their questions.
[01:18:18.639 --> 01:18:21.380]  But you've got the floor here to millions of people.
[01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:22.240]  What else do you want to hit?
[01:18:25.128 --> 01:18:35.319]  Well, I think it's important to really understand what's happening to Julian now and what has been this sort of persecution around Julian after publishing this information back in 2010-2011.
[01:18:37.532 --> 01:18:43.052]   That's information about the war in Iraq, undocumented civilian deaths in Iraq,
[01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:52.332]   with a war in Afghanistan, torture in Guantanamo Bay, and these diplomatic cables,
[01:18:52.332 --> 01:19:00.411]   the 250,000 diplomatic cables which expose this sort of global corruption network.
[01:19:00.411 --> 01:19:06.730]   I think what's important to understand about Julian is that his persecution is almost like
[01:19:06.730 --> 01:19:07.692]  another leak.
[01:19:08.114 --> 01:19:39.322]   You know, it's showing what is actually, what the links that our institutions or the institutions around the world can be corrupted to pursue someone who does this sort of thing, whether you're looking at the Crown Prosecuting Service in the United Kingdom, the UK Judiciary, which has been, I think Julian's faced 28 judges in the UK and only one has ever ruled, you know, they've all ruled against him except for one.
[01:19:40.102 --> 01:19:48.525]  So it really exposes the level at which our institutions are vulnerable to this sorts of corruption.
[01:19:48.545 --> 01:19:52.846]  I was about to say, isn't the current judge has been involved with MI6 covering up spying?
[01:19:54.139 --> 01:19:59.021]  I've seen reports that the judges are intimately involved in the apparatus of MI6 themselves.
[01:20:00.481 --> 01:20:08.444]  Yeah, well, I mean, the judges in the United Kingdom, they all go to the same schools, they all come from the same clubs.
[01:20:09.084 --> 01:20:13.465]  It's that sort of hierarchy or community there.
[01:20:13.765 --> 01:20:15.286]  They all know each other.
[01:20:16.866 --> 01:20:23.106]   One of the judges was actually an MI6 lawyer, I think is what you might be referring to and so now he's a High Court
[01:20:23.106 --> 01:20:24.747]  judge, but that's not uncommon.
[01:20:24.747 --> 01:20:33.747]   A previous judge that ruled against Julian was actually a roommate of the Minister who was in charge of
[01:20:33.747 --> 01:20:40.747]   expelling, in charge of the operation to expel Julian from the embassy.
[01:20:40.747 --> 01:20:50.747]   So in the United Kingdom you have all these types of links between the ruling elite there which is, you know, it's not
[01:20:50.747 --> 01:20:50.747]  uncommon.
[01:20:51.548 --> 01:21:01.351]  I think we sort of, the UK judiciary, it's sort of given a bit of standing that I don't think it really deserves.
[01:21:02.171 --> 01:21:08.254]  But they've been, you know, the willing participants in this and really almost the jailers and the torturers of Julian.
[01:21:09.134 --> 01:21:10.875]  They've been the ones keeping him in prison.
[01:21:11.355 --> 01:21:20.719]   They've been the ones who are extending this legal process that's gone on for five years and could go on for Well, clearly we've got to go to break, sir.
[01:21:20.759 --> 01:21:21.240]  Stay right there.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:22.360]  We're coming right back in just a few minutes.
[01:21:22.741 --> 01:21:24.422]  They want to send a message to everybody else.
[01:21:24.962 --> 01:21:28.385]  You leak, you expose crimes, we're going to throw you under the prison.
[01:21:29.105 --> 01:21:31.687]  And that's why we're all Julian Assange.
[01:21:31.707 --> 01:21:32.988]  I want to get your take on Biden.
[01:21:33.763 --> 01:21:48.331]  What the word is, are they going to drop these charges after 14 years in one form of confinement or another, five plus years in solitary confinement, or are they going to continue to just double down on evil?
[01:21:49.672 --> 01:21:52.614]  Julian Assange basically universally is loved left and right.
[01:21:53.014 --> 01:21:53.955]  People see right through it.
[01:21:53.975 --> 01:21:55.416]  I would call him a classical liberal.
[01:21:56.096 --> 01:21:58.097]  I just want to meet him in person someday when he's free.
[01:21:58.117 --> 01:21:58.697]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:58.717 --> 01:21:59.278]  All right.
[01:21:59.318 --> 01:22:02.840]  I just thought of this 10 minutes ago, but we posted on my real Alex Jones account.
[01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:06.731]  The Julian Assange's brother, Gabriel Shempton.
[01:22:10.013 --> 01:22:10.914]  What are your questions?
[01:22:11.654 --> 01:22:12.635]  And a lot of them are coming in.
[01:22:12.655 --> 01:22:14.376]  I've got some of those coming up.
[01:22:15.417 --> 01:22:17.378]  But I'm really getting the same question over and over again.
[01:22:17.398 --> 01:22:18.879]  What's your brother like?
[01:22:18.959 --> 01:22:19.599]  How do we help him?
[01:22:19.619 --> 01:22:25.343]  We've kind of already covered that, but let's drill back in what I played right when the interview started 25 minutes ago, 30 minutes ago.
[01:22:25.363 --> 01:22:25.463]  Biden.
[01:22:28.576 --> 01:22:32.562]  We've heard for a month or so is looking to maybe drop charges or whatever.
[01:22:33.103 --> 01:22:34.484]  He said, yes, we're looking at it.
[01:22:34.805 --> 01:22:36.828]  What is the latest information on that, sir?
[01:22:39.175 --> 01:22:58.362]  Well, I think that that statement from the President took us all a bit by surprise, really, you know, to have the President even, you know, there's so much happening in the world that to have him even considering, you know, considering these Australian requests with the Australian Government has been, you know, advocating for Julian's release.
[01:22:59.322 --> 01:23:13.728]  For a couple of years now, actually, there have been the Prime Minister and, you know, other members of the Government, the Australian Attorney General has even advocated directly with the DOJ in the United States.
[01:23:14.368 --> 01:23:20.368]   the Australian Parliament issued a statement or did a resolution actually where two thirds
[01:23:20.368 --> 01:23:27.887]   of the Parliament voted in favour of calling on the US to bring this persecution to a close.
[01:23:27.887 --> 01:23:33.247]   And so that question to the President was framed, you know, is he considering this Australian
[01:23:33.247 --> 01:23:38.887]   request? And I think, yeah, we were all a little bit surprised to hear that he was considering
[01:23:38.887 --> 01:23:44.608]   it. There have been several reports now in the Wall Street Journal that there were sources
[01:23:44.608 --> 01:23:51.528]   from the DOJ, you know, about these so-called plea deals or these sort of off-ramps that
[01:23:51.528 --> 01:23:53.968]  the DOJ would like to put forward.
[01:23:53.966 --> 01:24:03.110]  But yeah, I mean, Julian's lawyers, when those deals were first rumoured in the Wall Street Journal, Julian's lawyers said they didn't know.
[01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:09.750]   anything about those deals and that they had no communication with the DOJ. So I think what we're
[01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:15.429]   seeing now is some real movement around this, you know, a real movement around the case. And,
[01:24:15.429 --> 01:24:21.670]   you know, I think for the first time, it feels like we're pretty, pretty close to a resolution
[01:24:21.670 --> 01:24:28.788]   here. But I think what is important to go back and really, like, get to where this came from.
[01:24:28.957 --> 01:24:31.959]  Where did this prosecution, you know, actually come from?
[01:24:31.979 --> 01:24:42.865]  And it was back in 2017 when WikiLeaks published Vault 7, which was these CIA hacking tools.
[01:24:43.125 --> 01:24:45.527]  So there were hacking tools... And Gabriel, I want you to stop right there.
[01:24:46.127 --> 01:24:49.268]  Because we're on a lot of radio stations, a lot of TV stations.
[01:24:49.308 --> 01:24:51.429]  Gabriel Shepton is our guest.
[01:24:51.509 --> 01:24:54.290]  Gabriel Shepton is the brother of Julian Assange.
[01:24:54.671 --> 01:24:57.372]  I've seen a big thing on X saying, well, he doesn't have the same last name.
[01:24:57.412 --> 01:24:58.032]  How's his brother?
[01:24:58.492 --> 01:24:59.292]  I've been remarried.
[01:24:59.673 --> 01:25:00.773]  I've got two wives.
[01:25:00.813 --> 01:25:01.773]  I've got four children with him.
[01:25:02.794 --> 01:25:03.854]  You're on record as brother.
[01:25:04.315 --> 01:25:05.635]  You're on record as advocate.
[01:25:05.975 --> 01:25:08.156]  There's a whole nother conspiracy theory that you're not his brother.
[01:25:08.216 --> 01:25:10.677]  This is the level of serious ignorance.
[01:25:11.057 --> 01:25:18.303]   Gabriel Shepton at On X, Gabriel Shipton, S-H-I-P-T-O-N, is his brother.
[01:25:18.323 --> 01:25:20.585]  And it's important, I want you to start over.
[01:25:20.605 --> 01:25:21.767]  I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm going to shut up.
[01:25:22.594 --> 01:25:33.284]  Go back to what, 15 years ago or whatever it was, the CIA sex operatives they had met, how this all began, how he 15 years later is still locked up without a trial.
[01:25:33.904 --> 01:25:43.133]  And you're right, they really went crazy with Vault 7, the huge CIA spy grid backing up what Snowden was saying, all the illegal activity, the CIA spoofing people.
[01:25:43.873 --> 01:25:55.478]  And then walking through kind of some of the biggest things WikiLeaks did, exposing 2016 Hillary and the weird Aleister Crowley stuff, and you know, we'll have the kids ready for you in the hot tub at the farmhouse.
[01:25:55.738 --> 01:25:57.859]  They're seven years old, they're ready to service you.
[01:25:57.879 --> 01:26:00.400]  I mean, this is stuff the media never wanted to address.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:01.560]  This is hardcore.
[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:07.783]  So I'm going to be quiet now, Gabriel Shipton, but start over here with that, please.
[01:26:10.509 --> 01:26:16.793]  Well, I guess it all starts with the publishing of this information, these leaks by Chelsea Manning.
[01:26:17.413 --> 01:26:27.680]  So Chelsea Manning, who leaked this information back in 2010, 2011, she actually tried to take it to the New York Times and they didn't want the information.
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:29.541]  So she ended up going to WikiLeaks.
[01:26:29.561 --> 01:26:34.044]  So WikiLeaks is sort of this publisher of last resort in that sense.
[01:26:34.084 --> 01:26:52.122]   And that's really like if you want to track the timeline of this persecution, When Julian started publishing this information and when Wikileaks started publishing this leaked information is when the crackdown and the attacks on Julian personally, but also on Wikileaks really began.
[01:26:52.142 --> 01:27:01.037]   And we saw, you know, a financial, an international financial, extra-legal banking blockade That was led by John McCain.
[01:27:02.418 --> 01:27:06.819]  Visa, Mastercard, cutting off Wikileaks.
[01:27:07.219 --> 01:27:09.060]  Wikileaks was surviving on donations.
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:10.780]  It never took advertising money or anything.
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:13.661]  It's solely supported by its readers.
[01:27:14.601 --> 01:27:20.603]  They cut off the Mastercard, cut off Visa, closed Julian's personal bank accounts, shut down their PayPal.
[01:27:21.423 --> 01:27:22.684]  Yeah, I think that's a good point.
[01:27:22.964 --> 01:27:25.005]  I think that's a good point.
[01:27:24.824 --> 01:27:32.503]   that they were capable of and it was then that these allegations in Sweden came up.
[01:27:32.503 --> 01:27:38.423]   And it's, you know, Julian, during that time Julian was invited to the United...
[01:27:38.585 --> 01:27:39.386]  He was in Sweden.
[01:27:40.587 --> 01:27:54.640]  He was invited to the United Kingdom and there were these allegations, these sexual allegations against him by these two women who actually later admitted that they didn't want to bring any investigation into it.
[01:27:55.681 --> 01:28:04.389]  But Julian went for questioning at the time with the Swedish police, and he was given the all-clear to leave the country.
[01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:25.943]   The investigation was closed, and it was actually while he was in the air, flying from Sweden to the UK, that they secretly reopened the investigation, issued an Interpol Red Notice for Julian under the European arrest warrant system. And when Julian landed is when he
[01:28:25.943 --> 01:28:32.213]   started to having to fight his first, you know, these extradition, you know, these extradition
[01:28:32.213 --> 01:28:34.024]  attempts against him.
[01:28:34.024 --> 01:28:39.304]   And it's actually interesting that when he was on that flight from Sweden to the United Kingdom,
[01:28:39.304 --> 01:28:43.543]   all his baggage went missing. And there was actually a lot of unpublished material,
[01:28:44.344 --> 01:28:51.144]   video evidence of massacres and things like that, that all went missing on that flight.
[01:28:51.402 --> 01:28:58.745]  I think that famous collateral murder video is the video that you showed earlier of the helicopter gunship.
[01:28:59.245 --> 01:28:59.905]  Thank you very much.
[01:28:59.725 --> 01:29:06.204]   down those two Reuters journalists and then also shooting up the van that came to rescue
[01:29:06.204 --> 01:29:11.045]   them which actually had children in it as well. We would have seen more videos like
[01:29:11.045 --> 01:29:18.525]   that. We would have seen much more video information if Julian's luggage hadn't gone missing on
[01:29:18.525 --> 01:29:19.084]  that flight.
[01:29:20.015 --> 01:29:25.680]  But that was the longest running preliminary investigation in Swedish history.
[01:29:26.401 --> 01:29:28.022]  It ran for seven years.
[01:29:28.042 --> 01:29:31.245]  It was open and closed four times.
[01:29:32.246 --> 01:29:33.387]  Different prosecutors.
[01:29:34.147 --> 01:29:37.951]  There was actually some emails, email communication.
[01:29:38.511 --> 01:29:42.493]  Between the Crown Prosecuting Service and the Swedish Prosecuting Service.
[01:29:42.913 --> 01:29:48.356]  So all that Sweden had to do to further the investigation and to close it was to come and question Julian.
[01:29:48.736 --> 01:29:51.218]  But they would refuse to do that inside the Embassy.
[01:29:51.958 --> 01:29:57.901]  And so there was this email communication back and forth from the Swedish prosecutors to the Crown prosecutors.
[01:29:58.622 --> 01:30:05.405]   And there's an email out there, email evidence that from the Crown prosecutors The Swedes are trying to pull out.
[01:30:05.445 --> 01:30:06.306]  They're trying to get out of it.
[01:30:06.346 --> 01:30:10.569]  And the Crown Prosecutor sends them an email saying, don't get cold feet.
[01:30:10.949 --> 01:30:14.051]  This is about more than a simple extradition, you know.
[01:30:14.071 --> 01:30:49.025]   And so that's email evidence there that there was a conspiracy the whole time to keep Julian inside the Ecuadorian embassy using this You know this Swedish investigation and this extradition attempt to Sweden and it was when Julian was taken from the embassy in 2019 is when they you know threw up their hands and said oh we don't have enough evidence to continue this investigation and we're going to now close the investigation but by that time the US had revealed their indictment
[01:30:49.645 --> 01:30:57.165]   and the charges that Julian feared the whole time, which is why he sought asylum in the
[01:30:57.165 --> 01:31:01.365]  embassy, were brought down.
[01:31:01.365 --> 01:31:09.805]   I was about to say, clearly other people like Edward Snowden saw what happened to your brother
[01:31:09.805 --> 01:31:11.484]  and they ran to Russia, which is sad.
[01:31:11.499 --> 01:31:12.420]  You've got to run to Russia.
[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:19.526]  That's obviously got some authoritarian issues, but compared to the West, it's very, very sad.
[01:31:19.986 --> 01:31:23.229]  I've got a lot of questions here for you, but I want to go back to Biden.
[01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:32.938]   What do you think this audience can do with Biden signaling, because he knows he's incredibly popular, your brother's been tortured for being a hero, What do you think we can do?
[01:31:33.018 --> 01:31:33.718]  Call Congress?
[01:31:33.738 --> 01:31:34.359]  Call Biden?
[01:31:35.119 --> 01:31:36.620]  To get them to drop these charges?
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:39.342]  And what do you think your brother's going to do if they drop the charges?
[01:31:42.144 --> 01:31:49.889]  Yeah, so we're asking people to call their representatives, call their congressperson, ask them to sign on to Resolution 934, House Resolution 934.
[01:31:51.630 --> 01:31:53.692]  You know, ask them to get on it, co-sponsor it.
[01:31:54.712 --> 01:31:57.714]  We're really building the constituency for dueling in Congress now.
[01:31:57.734 --> 01:32:11.605]   We've got about 20 Congress people who are all supporting All supporting Julian's freedom and we really want to grow that to show that there is political goodwill out there for these charges to be dropped.
[01:32:11.645 --> 01:32:22.594]  Because we know it exists but having that in Congress I think is very important and will send a message not just to the President but also to the Department of Justice.
[01:32:22.654 --> 01:32:25.216]  But I think it's important to go back to that 2017 time.
[01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:54.009]   When they published these Vault 7 leaks, Mike Pompeo was the new CIA Director, and in his very first speech as CIA Director, he made It basically went off the deep end essentially and said, we're going to use, we're going to go after Wikileaks, we're going to go after Julian with everything we've got.
[01:32:54.049 --> 01:32:57.272]  They called them a non-state hostile intelligence agency.
[01:32:57.313 --> 01:33:03.259]  And what that actual, that was actually a legal term that we didn't know at the time, but what that actually meant.
[01:33:03.743 --> 01:33:09.422]   was that they could use all their clandestine operations similarly that they would use say
[01:33:09.422 --> 01:33:14.383]   against you know the Iranian secret service or the Russian FSB they could now use those
[01:33:14.383 --> 01:33:22.222]   against a publisher against WikiLeaks and so that's when we really saw this ramping up.
[01:33:22.222 --> 01:33:27.343]   And Gabriel let me just back you up there because we haven't broke this yet
[01:33:28.222 --> 01:33:32.143]  But Congress is set to have hearings on this.
[01:33:32.189 --> 01:33:33.092]  I've confirmed this.
[01:33:33.112 --> 01:33:40.328]  I can't talk about it in detail, but I remember seven years ago when they said I was a Russian agent with no proof in the Armed Services House Committee.
[01:33:41.454 --> 01:33:48.035]  We've now learned that that's what I've been designated with is a non-state hostile intelligence agency.
[01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:51.296]  And so we know they said Trump was that as well.
[01:33:51.356 --> 01:33:57.057]  Instead of just saying he's a Russian agent with no proof, now they just go, no, you're just a hostile state or hostile group.
[01:33:57.197 --> 01:34:02.619]  You mean hostile to this rogue government intelligence agency operation.
[01:34:02.639 --> 01:34:05.279]  That's why I say your brother is patient zero.
[01:34:05.279 --> 01:34:10.557]   And it's come out recently, the FBI and CIA has been running these huge disinformation campaigns
[01:34:10.557 --> 01:34:15.118]   against me, making up things I never did, funding lawsuits, doing it.
[01:34:15.118 --> 01:34:19.198]   If they are able to do this to your brother, and then there was actually the Wall Street Journal
[01:34:19.198 --> 01:34:24.198]   six years ago, they said, "Once we get Julian Assange and the left doesn't stand up,
[01:34:24.198 --> 01:34:26.639]  then we get Jones and the right doesn't stand up."
[01:34:26.574 --> 01:34:27.615]  We'll be able to get them all.
[01:34:27.935 --> 01:34:29.276]  That was a big Wall Street Journal article.
[01:34:29.316 --> 01:34:33.059]  So this is a long-term strategic plan to set the table.
[01:34:33.559 --> 01:34:37.602]  And any totalitarian system targets a few people first to set the precedent.
[01:34:37.902 --> 01:34:42.466]  That's why your brother isn't just a hero, but he also represents all of us.
[01:34:42.706 --> 01:34:44.607]  And so, again, nothing compared to your brother.
[01:34:45.088 --> 01:34:48.090]  But they would like to do everything to me they've done to your brother.
[01:34:48.130 --> 01:34:51.973]  That's why I have particular interest and particular empathy here.
[01:34:54.397 --> 01:34:55.278]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:34:56.199 --> 01:35:05.106]  So at that time is when they installed high-definition cameras all throughout the embassy where Julian... And the CIA was spying on him internally?
[01:35:05.126 --> 01:35:06.167]  Remember that came out?
[01:35:06.547 --> 01:35:09.770]  That they secretly had a group... High-definition cameras.
[01:35:10.131 --> 01:35:18.958]  The security company that was meant to be protecting Julian was co-opted by the CIA and they installed microphones everywhere inside the embassy.
[01:35:18.978 --> 01:35:25.820]   You would go to visit Julian and you would have to hand over your phone your passport and what they were actually doing was they
[01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:31.681]   were taking photos of your IMA numbers, of your SIM card, of your identification so
[01:35:31.681 --> 01:35:37.261]   they could have a list of everybody who came out in and out of the embassy and track that
[01:35:37.261 --> 01:35:42.100]   information on who was coming and going from the embassy, who was coming to see Julian.
[01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:46.579]   But they recorded all these meetings with his lawyers, all these meetings with his doctors.
[01:35:46.579 --> 01:35:51.260]  So your brother is a microcosm of all of this?
[01:35:51.352 --> 01:36:01.103]  And but it gets worse because they're actually planning, there was sketches, you know, reportedly sketches drawn up within the CIA to murder Julian.
[01:36:02.344 --> 01:36:05.287]  And that was confirmed by these Yahoo News journalists.
[01:36:06.669 --> 01:36:17.550]   And Yeah, in these reports, you know, 30 former current and former intelligence agency workers confirmed that these sketches existed from within the CIA.
[01:36:18.230 --> 01:36:22.411]  There were even plots to kidnap Julian from the Ecuadorian embassy.
[01:36:23.112 --> 01:36:26.753]  And these plots to kidnap Julian made it as high as the White House.
[01:36:27.353 --> 01:36:33.136]   And this Yahoo News report Sure, they're hysterical because he's exposing their crimes.
[01:36:32.956 --> 01:36:36.835]   DOJ at the time said, well, if you kidnap him from the embassy, what are you going to
[01:36:36.835 --> 01:36:41.395]   do with him? You can't just put him in Guantanamo. You can't take him to one of our black sites.
[01:36:41.395 --> 01:36:47.355]   Let us get this indictment together so that when he comes out of the prison, we've got
[01:36:47.355 --> 01:36:52.596]   something to charge him with. And so you can see this sort of progression of the political
[01:36:52.596 --> 01:36:55.076]  nature of this of this prosecution.
[01:36:55.076 --> 01:36:57.716]  Sure, they're hysterical because he's exposing their crimes.
[01:36:57.716 --> 01:37:02.275]   Let me ask you this. Why do you think Biden, at least on the surface, is saying he may
[01:37:02.275 --> 01:37:05.034]  drop charges?
[01:37:03.503 --> 01:37:05.325]  Is that because of incredible political pressure?
[01:37:05.525 --> 01:37:09.727]  Or is that just a diversion?
[01:37:09.747 --> 01:37:12.229]  I know you don't know, but what do you think?
[01:37:12.309 --> 01:37:14.150]  And I should ask you this question after that.
[01:37:14.551 --> 01:37:16.031]  When's the last time you talked to your brother?
[01:37:16.071 --> 01:37:16.652]  How is he doing?
[01:37:19.656 --> 01:37:23.658]  Well, I think, you know, I think it's because of the requests from Australia.
[01:37:24.039 --> 01:37:32.904]  Essentially, that's, you know, it's the Australian government and the Australian population, you know, who are requesting this of the United States.
[01:37:33.024 --> 01:37:35.645]  And that was the framing of that question, right?
[01:37:35.665 --> 01:37:40.988]  Like, are you considering the Australian's requests to drop the charges against Julian?
[01:37:41.008 --> 01:37:48.673]  I mean, Julian's incredibly popular in Australia, 90% of the population, you know, in the polling, 90% of the population wants him back.
[01:37:49.413 --> 01:38:00.679]  And I think Australia is incredibly strategically important to the United States at the moment, particularly in regard to the mineral resources that are there.
[01:38:01.379 --> 01:38:11.724]  Securing those mineral resources, you know, the rare metals, lithium, titanium, all these types of things that are needed are all found in Australia.
[01:38:13.505 --> 01:38:18.227]  They're necessary for the China containment, the current China containment strategies.
[01:38:19.268 --> 01:38:32.394]  And so this is the one sticking point with the Australians is like, well, you know, you need us for this, you know, you need our resources, you need us for this China containment, but you're actually, you know, abusing one of our citizens.
[01:38:32.434 --> 01:38:35.136]  So it sort of doesn't gel for many Australians.
[01:38:35.156 --> 01:38:41.140]   And I think Absolutely.
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:49.787]  So I want to talk about the timetable here and the time we have left.
[01:38:49.807 --> 01:38:51.949]  You've got to come back again and this is so important.
[01:38:51.969 --> 01:38:52.649]  It's great to have you.
[01:38:53.050 --> 01:38:55.752]  We have Julian Assange's brother with us right now, Gabriel Shipton.
[01:38:56.292 --> 01:39:04.790]   But Gabriel, Looking at this, your brother has already run a thousand mile marathon.
[01:39:05.530 --> 01:39:09.613]  And I know that they know he's a man of his word.
[01:39:09.713 --> 01:39:10.634]  I think he's done enough.
[01:39:11.134 --> 01:39:12.535]  The problem is he's such a hero.
[01:39:12.596 --> 01:39:13.436]  He's so strong.
[01:39:13.796 --> 01:39:14.697]  They've almost killed him.
[01:39:15.378 --> 01:39:19.060]  If he tells his lawyers, I will retire after this.
[01:39:20.001 --> 01:39:21.242]  I'll go into abstention.
[01:39:21.542 --> 01:39:23.543]  Maybe I'll write a book to fund myself.
[01:39:23.603 --> 01:39:24.603]  It needs money, obviously.
[01:39:25.164 --> 01:39:26.084]  But that's it.
[01:39:26.785 --> 01:39:27.585]  They will let him out.
[01:39:27.625 --> 01:39:28.545]  They're scared of him.
[01:39:28.625 --> 01:39:30.847]  And so I want him to be freed.
[01:39:32.087 --> 01:39:32.427]  Are they?
[01:39:32.447 --> 01:39:33.768]  Because I don't know what's going on.
[01:39:33.828 --> 01:39:34.468]  I'm just guessing.
[01:39:34.869 --> 01:39:38.030]  Are they putting pressure on him to make assurances?
[01:39:38.370 --> 01:39:40.592]  Because if he disappears after this, I don't blame him.
[01:39:40.932 --> 01:39:43.053]  He's run a thousand mile marathon, as I said.
[01:39:44.282 --> 01:39:45.303]  I'm just speculating here.
[01:39:45.343 --> 01:39:46.403]  Is any of that going on?
[01:39:46.463 --> 01:39:47.504]  I mean, are they threatening him?
[01:39:47.804 --> 01:39:49.185]  Are they threatening new charges?
[01:39:49.685 --> 01:39:53.547]  I mean, you know, because these are really satanic opportunists.
[01:39:53.947 --> 01:39:59.470]  The fact that they're talking about releasing him tells me they're maybe scared of something else he's got somewhere else.
[01:39:59.510 --> 01:40:00.611]  I'm purely speculating here.
[01:40:02.853 --> 01:40:05.014]  Well, I think you just have to look at the extradition.
[01:40:05.414 --> 01:40:07.134]  The extradition is continuing on.
[01:40:07.794 --> 01:40:09.094]  The process is continuing on.
[01:40:09.134 --> 01:40:23.938]  Just today, the US Embassy in the UK offered up these so-called assurances to the UK courts, assurances that Julian wouldn't receive the death penalty if he's extradited.
[01:40:24.918 --> 01:40:48.826]  And this other sort of weird and wacky assurance that, you know, he can argue that he, you know, he can argue that he is entitled to First Amendment rights if he's extradited because that was one of the points that the UK judges, was one of the points that the UK judges brought up in this appeal was that... Yeah, so maybe Biden's only claiming he may drop charges so there's not political pressure so he can burn him.
[01:40:48.846 --> 01:40:49.746]  Maybe it's a feint.
[01:40:52.068 --> 01:41:07.138]  Yeah, I don't really know, but I think the pressure on Julian is the extradition, is the continuing extradition process and the continued treatment in this maximum security prison.
[01:41:08.058 --> 01:41:15.582]  You know, the sort of, the status quo really is in favor of those who are chasing Julian.
[01:41:15.983 --> 01:41:19.364]  You know, the UK is washing this attack on the First Amendment.
[01:41:19.405 --> 01:41:25.128]  They're washing this on... Sure, and it's all very embarrassing, and I don't mean to interrupt you for the time we have left.
[01:41:25.408 --> 01:41:26.749]  I've got a lot of questions coming in.
[01:41:26.769 --> 01:41:28.149]  The same question's been asked like five times.
[01:41:28.530 --> 01:41:32.572]  Chase Geyser asked the question, who's been running WikiLeaks since Julian has been gone?
[01:41:32.592 --> 01:41:35.974]  Is it still a reliable source of information or has it been compromised?
[01:41:38.171 --> 01:41:42.834]  Well, Kristen Harrison is the Editor-in-Chief of WikiLeaks and I know him personally.
[01:41:44.455 --> 01:41:46.937]  WikiLeaks has been able to stay online.
[01:41:46.957 --> 01:41:55.463]  The whole archive, even though it goes offline sometimes, coming under attacks and different things like that, the archive has managed to stay up and running.
[01:41:55.883 --> 01:42:05.190]   Obviously, they're really focused on this fight to free Julian and so you haven't seen the same I don't understand.
[01:42:05.210 --> 01:42:06.612]  So they tied him down with the attack.
[01:42:07.633 --> 01:42:11.797]  Overall then, what do you think your brother will do if he is released?
[01:42:14.656 --> 01:42:19.517]  Well, I mean, you know, I think hopefully he gets to spend some time with his kids.
[01:42:19.557 --> 01:42:23.938]  He's got two small children, you know, my nephews Gabriel and Max.
[01:42:25.159 --> 01:42:27.359]  You know, they've only known him inside that prison.
[01:42:27.479 --> 01:42:29.500]  They haven't, they call it a daddy's house.
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:32.441]  They go to see him once a week.
[01:42:32.461 --> 01:42:37.904]   So hopefully he can come out and I'm not saying he should do this, but I think he's done enough.
[01:42:37.824 --> 01:42:45.543]   parade. The doctors I've spoken to who have seen him said that he can get better, but
[01:42:45.543 --> 01:42:47.343]  he will need time to rest.
[01:42:47.343 --> 01:42:51.944]   I'm not saying he should do this, but I think he's done enough. If he signals that he'll
[01:42:51.944 --> 01:42:54.784]  just write a book to fund himself.
[01:42:54.834 --> 01:42:55.695]  I think they'll let him out.
[01:42:55.955 --> 01:42:57.135]  I'm not trying to get him to sell out.
[01:42:57.215 --> 01:42:57.955]  It's not a sellout.
[01:42:58.296 --> 01:42:58.856]  He's done enough.
[01:42:58.936 --> 01:43:03.017]  I think if he signals, but if he comes out as a cause celeb, they're going to kill him in prison.
[01:43:03.497 --> 01:43:04.798]  And so I want to save your brother.
[01:43:04.838 --> 01:43:09.880]  So I, when you talk to your brother, you tell him, and maybe my advice, he's smarter than I am.
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:10.320]  Probably.
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:12.100]  I think he's done his job.
[01:43:12.801 --> 01:43:13.981]  And so I think he's done enough.
[01:43:14.041 --> 01:43:17.822]  I think if he signals that he will basically just write a book and that's it.
[01:43:18.282 --> 01:43:19.043]  I think they'll let him go.
[01:43:19.083 --> 01:43:19.883]  If not, they're going to kill him.
[01:43:21.727 --> 01:43:23.468]  Yeah, I hope you're right, Alex.
[01:43:23.728 --> 01:43:24.429]  I hope you're right.
[01:43:24.569 --> 01:43:25.570]  I hope that is the case.
[01:43:25.690 --> 01:43:28.292]  Do you think you can advise him then?
[01:43:28.512 --> 01:43:29.352]  Just signal to them?
[01:43:29.412 --> 01:43:30.353]  Because they're scared of him.
[01:43:31.214 --> 01:43:35.677]  Yeah, I mean, I'll communicate that to him.
[01:43:35.717 --> 01:43:44.123]  But I think, you know, if any of us were in Julian's position and someone offered us the key to their prison cell, I'm sure they would take it.
[01:43:44.183 --> 01:43:51.607]   So, you know, I'm not I think Julian would definitely take an offer like that if it was on the table.
[01:43:51.827 --> 01:43:52.127]  Huge.
[01:43:52.507 --> 01:43:52.767]  Huge.
[01:43:53.147 --> 01:43:54.008]  I've got another question.
[01:43:54.388 --> 01:43:56.869]  I'm not mad at the people on X, but a lot of the questions are stupid.
[01:43:57.469 --> 01:44:01.911]  I mean, like, there's thousands of questions and like 10 of them are... I'm a little frustrated.
[01:44:02.271 --> 01:44:05.212]  Rob Dew, one of our crew, I'm not trying to give our crew's questions, but they're the best questions.
[01:44:05.632 --> 01:44:12.075]  Rob Dew, our news director, says, is there anything WikiLeaks has been holding on to, like a dead man switch in case Julian is assassinated?
[01:44:14.705 --> 01:44:16.908]  Well, no, not that I know of, no.
[01:44:17.829 --> 01:44:26.258]  I think there was some, you know, back in the day there was some tweets about Deadman switches and things like that, but I think that that time has really passed now.
[01:44:26.278 --> 01:44:28.660]  You know, I don't think they've got anything.
[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:30.022]  I don't think they're sitting on anything.
[01:44:30.062 --> 01:44:33.666]  I don't think they're able to really look at things, verify things.
[01:44:33.686 --> 01:44:39.971]   I mean, Julian was the head of Wikileaks and really without him, It's not able to really function.
[01:44:40.211 --> 01:44:48.418]  And that was the purpose of his prosecution, was to take him out and to set this example to everyone that if you do this sort of thing, you won't have any rights.
[01:44:48.778 --> 01:44:54.643]  We'll be able to come into whatever country we want to, snatch you up, put you in a jail for as long as we want.
[01:44:55.484 --> 01:45:00.448]  It's about terrorizing journalists and the fact that more journalists don't rally to his cause.
[01:45:01.268 --> 01:45:02.029]  It's a litmus test.
[01:45:02.049 --> 01:45:04.211]  If you don't support Julian Assange, you're not a journalist.
[01:45:04.611 --> 01:45:05.211]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:45:05.632 --> 01:45:06.352]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:45:07.072 --> 01:45:07.333]  It is.
[01:45:07.373 --> 01:45:08.453]  It's like an exposure.
[01:45:08.473 --> 01:45:13.836]  It really shows who's a journalist and who's not by those who are supporting Julian Assange.
[01:45:14.497 --> 01:45:17.939]  Well, I don't want to sound like a wimp here saying your brother should hang up his hat.
[01:45:18.399 --> 01:45:20.420]  It's just that they've almost killed him as you know him.
[01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:21.381]  I've seen the news.
[01:45:21.401 --> 01:45:22.421]  He's in bad shape, right?
[01:45:22.461 --> 01:45:25.163]  I mean, I think he's a hero.
[01:45:25.503 --> 01:45:26.424]  We can save him.
[01:45:26.444 --> 01:45:28.024]  I think that's what matters now.
[01:45:28.104 --> 01:45:28.765]  He's done his job.
[01:45:31.135 --> 01:45:33.139]  Yeah, I'm with you, Alex.
[01:45:33.159 --> 01:45:35.883]  Yeah, we've been fighting this battle for a very long time.
[01:45:35.903 --> 01:45:50.602]   We're all very tired and we're all ready to Yeah, it'd be so good just to have Julian back with his family, recuperating and, you know, just have a sort of normal, you know, a semi-normal conversation with my family.
[01:45:50.622 --> 01:45:55.285]  You know, all we ever talk about now is what, how are we going to, we're strategising, what can we do next?
[01:45:55.365 --> 01:46:02.869]  How can we, you know, you know, how can we affect more political change or, you know, who are we engaging with and doing all that sort of stuff?
[01:46:02.909 --> 01:46:07.232]   It's taken over our lives and so, All right, well, Gabriel Shipton, I know you got to go.
[01:46:07.252 --> 01:46:10.235]  We've got a two-minute break, five more minutes, closing comments from you.
[01:46:10.615 --> 01:46:11.416]  Come back soon.
[01:46:11.476 --> 01:46:13.158]  This is really important for everybody.
[01:46:13.578 --> 01:46:17.322]  I've been persecuted by the same folks, not the same level, but I have extreme empathy.
[01:46:17.602 --> 01:46:18.843]  We are all Julian Assange.
[01:46:18.883 --> 01:46:19.363]  Stay there.
[01:46:19.644 --> 01:46:20.444]  Closing comments.
[01:46:21.205 --> 01:46:24.989]  Brother of Julian Assange, Gabriel Shipton is our guest.
[01:46:25.769 --> 01:46:30.334]  We've got five minutes left before a ton of other news I haven't hit coming up and a special guest.
[01:46:31.209 --> 01:46:33.630]  You've got the floor, sir, for any other key points you want to make.
[01:46:34.131 --> 01:46:35.872]  You've not asked for support financially.
[01:46:35.892 --> 01:46:36.792]  I don't know if we can do that.
[01:46:36.852 --> 01:46:37.813]  How do we support WikiLeaks?
[01:46:38.213 --> 01:46:39.094]  What else can we do?
[01:46:39.974 --> 01:46:40.735]  Last five minutes, sir.
[01:46:43.553 --> 01:46:52.262]  Well, yeah, as I said, the most important thing and the action that we're putting out at the moment is supporting this resolution, House Resolution 934.
[01:46:52.682 --> 01:46:57.507]  You can go to the website assangecampaign.org.
[01:46:58.008 --> 01:47:02.973]  That's assangecampaign.org and there's a really easy to use email tool.
[01:47:03.713 --> 01:47:06.737]  It'll take you two minutes to email your representative.
[01:47:07.437 --> 01:47:17.168]  So yeah, I would ask everybody to go on to AssangeCampaign.org and just take two minutes, pop in your email and send an email off to your representative.
[01:47:17.948 --> 01:47:24.055]  It's very, very quick and very easy and does actually make a difference in these offices.
[01:47:24.075 --> 01:47:24.916]  They're always adding up.
[01:47:25.316 --> 01:47:37.667]  You know, the different issues that they're getting attention to, and when we're lobbying here in Washington, we see the results of the constituents actually emailing.
[01:47:37.687 --> 01:47:40.710]  So yeah, AssangeCampaign.org to send that email.
[01:47:40.750 --> 01:47:46.335]  Follow myself on Twitter, Gabriel Shipton, and also follow Julian's wife, Stella underscore Assange.
[01:47:47.858 --> 01:47:55.953]  On Twitter, we're always posting up-to-date good information and more actions that you can be a part of.
[01:47:59.349 --> 01:48:00.609]  I think soon.
[01:48:00.689 --> 01:48:01.790]  We're very close now.
[01:48:02.090 --> 01:48:11.012]  We're sort of at this, I feel like we're at this zone now where every action that is taken really, really counts.
[01:48:12.613 --> 01:48:17.434]  And we can sort of see, you know, a light at the end of the tunnel.
[01:48:17.314 --> 01:48:30.194]  So, all your support is very much appreciated.
[01:48:30.921 --> 01:48:31.662]  I think it's back now.
[01:48:32.102 --> 01:48:32.703]  Gabriel, continue.
[01:48:32.723 --> 01:48:34.165]  You're saying we're at the line at the end of the tunnel?
[01:48:36.628 --> 01:48:36.968]  Yeah.
[01:48:37.008 --> 01:48:42.595]  Yeah, so all the actions that happen now really, really count more than they ever have.
[01:48:42.615 --> 01:48:46.359]  And it's really important now that all the advocates really come out in support.
[01:48:47.859 --> 01:49:18.683]   At this critical time, when there's a sort of shifting sense in sitting with the Biden, with them coming out saying we're considering it, it's really important for the advocates now to really raise their voices and to take any kind of action, particularly supporting this House Resolution 934, but also sharing good information with You know, on Twitter or X or social media to really raise the level of the discussion as well.
[01:49:20.725 --> 01:49:22.026]  I absolutely agree with you.
[01:49:22.306 --> 01:49:30.494]  You know, overall, I think that Elon Musk has said some things about your brother.
[01:49:31.034 --> 01:49:35.058]  And I really think everybody needs to understand that we're all being targeted by the same system.
[01:49:35.078 --> 01:49:36.199]  We need a counterbalance.
[01:49:36.932 --> 01:49:40.856]  To these out-of-control intelligence agencies, and we're here right now.
[01:49:41.216 --> 01:49:45.176]   What's the last thing, unless it's something you can't talk about, the last time you talked
[01:49:45.176 --> 01:49:47.536]  to your brother Julian Assange, what did he say?
[01:49:47.536 --> 01:49:57.376]   Yeah, well, we never, I mean, we talk, we try and have a laugh when I go to the prison, really,
[01:49:57.376 --> 01:50:01.655]   you know, and talk about gossip and, you know, who I've met, his old friends,
[01:50:01.655 --> 01:50:03.414]  and different things like that.
[01:50:03.414 --> 01:50:14.278]   So, you know, it's, It's mundane, it's pretty boring stuff, but we always have a laugh about our dad.
[01:50:14.358 --> 01:50:16.279]  Sure, but he's kind of living through you, then.
[01:50:16.299 --> 01:50:18.019]  He's reaching out to the wider world through you.
[01:50:21.089 --> 01:50:22.230]  Yeah, we're his lifeline.
[01:50:22.270 --> 01:50:25.774]  His family, you know, his contact with the outside world.
[01:50:26.395 --> 01:50:27.756]  We're his lifeline to the outside world.
[01:50:27.796 --> 01:50:31.200]  We keep him connected to what's going on around the world, the different actions.
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:37.967]  And that, you know, feeds his fire to keep going inside, his hearing about all those actions that are happening around the world.
[01:50:41.066 --> 01:50:42.367]  He's a real hero for humanity.
[01:50:42.186 --> 01:50:46.266]  and the women of King and the people who are supporting him.
[01:50:46.266 --> 01:50:48.146]  That's what keeps him going on the inside.
[01:50:48.146 --> 01:50:55.865]   And he is about that through myself, through my dad, through Stella, and that keeps him going.
[01:50:55.865 --> 01:50:59.225]   All right, Gabriel Shepton, I'm gonna try to get your number to Joe Rogan.
[01:50:59.225 --> 01:51:00.506]  Hopefully he gets you on.
[01:51:00.506 --> 01:51:03.266]   We love you, we appreciate you, and God bless you and your sons.
[01:51:03.266 --> 01:51:04.225]  We love your brother.
[01:51:04.225 --> 01:51:05.426]  He's a real hero for humanity.
[01:51:05.426 --> 01:51:06.346]  Thank you so much.
[01:51:09.905 --> 01:51:12.905]  It's been sold out for six months.
[01:51:13.208 --> 01:51:14.689]  It's our number two bestseller.

[01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:22.694]  The highest quality, pure, deep earth crystal iodine you're going to find anywhere.
[01:51:23.074 --> 01:51:26.216]  With the two other types of iodine that are great for your body as well.

[01:51:33.481 --> 01:51:36.183]  I could talk for hours about this on air and I am planning to next week.
[01:51:36.943 --> 01:51:42.305]  But the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[01:51:42.665 --> 01:51:44.186]  And all iodine is not created equal.
[01:51:44.506 --> 01:51:49.728]  Most iodine is bound to other things in the environment, whether it's plants or animals you're eating, so you don't absorb it.
[01:51:50.028 --> 01:51:50.648]  This is pure.
[01:51:50.688 --> 01:51:51.648]  It goes right into your cells.

[01:52:12.463 --> 01:52:20.132]  And San Diego got a great interview with a whistleblower at the airport on the massive illegal alien invasion taking place now.
[01:52:20.632 --> 01:52:27.160]  The DSA robs you and your family, but the illegals, in many cases with no ID, including small children, go straight through.
[01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:29.042]  Here's part of the viral interview.
[01:52:29.142 --> 01:52:31.645]  We'll take a look at what's happening on a wider scale.
[01:52:31.665 --> 01:52:32.086]  Straight ahead.
[01:52:33.496 --> 01:52:45.487]  Alright, Matt Baker here reporting live from San Diego at the airport and we were surprised that this gentleman right here, we were asking him where we might find some of the migrants and he was just as pissed off and frustrated about it as we are.
[01:52:45.527 --> 01:52:46.447]  Tell us a little bit about it.
[01:52:47.068 --> 01:52:59.118]   Well, the problem is that they get released from the When they've been locked up, they just cross the border, process in a couple of days, and then they get released.
[01:52:59.838 --> 01:53:07.724]  So when they come to the airport, most of them, they don't have tickets, they don't have money, they don't have not even a place to go.
[01:53:08.425 --> 01:53:13.048]  And we have a problem that they don't have a credit card to pay for the fare.
[01:53:14.970 --> 01:53:19.593]  And the breaking part, I mean, the breaking heart is that you see children, they're hungry.
[01:53:21.855 --> 01:53:25.036]  So they created a lot of problems for our operation.
[01:53:25.636 --> 01:53:29.777]  They leave trash all over the place and they fall asleep all over the place.
[01:53:30.398 --> 01:53:37.000]  And the bathrooms, I've seen guys taking a shower, I mean not a shower, washing their feet in the sink.
[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:41.341]  And it's really a big problem for the operation.
[01:53:41.361 --> 01:53:44.562]  Is it getting worse and do you see any ending in sight?
[01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:48.192]  Do you think that it was better during the Trump years or now that Biden's in?
[01:53:48.212 --> 01:53:49.693]  Do you think it's got worse?
[01:53:49.533 --> 01:53:58.052]   organization that they bring in 10, 20 immigrants at the time and they bring in
[01:53:58.052 --> 01:54:04.533]   on the bus and they help them everything they need in order to get across.
[01:54:04.533 --> 01:54:10.533]   Do you think that it was better during the Trump years or now that Biden's in?
[01:54:10.533 --> 01:54:13.533]   Do you think it's got worse? You don't have to answer that question if you don't want to.
[01:54:13.533 --> 01:54:16.533]  No, I do, I do, I do.
[01:54:14.608 --> 01:54:22.693]  I think Trump had more control over the border and it's terrible what this administration is doing.
[01:54:23.894 --> 01:54:29.758]  Just take the immigrants, let them go through, process the immigrants in a couple of days.
[01:54:30.339 --> 01:54:40.424]   They come to my desk trying to get a ticket and I see the form and they give an appointment A court date for two years later, one year later.
[01:54:40.864 --> 01:54:43.645]  So these people, they're never going to show up for their appointment.
[01:54:44.025 --> 01:54:48.787]  So it's not a racist thing, it's just simply, you gotta come in legally and do things the right way.
[01:54:48.827 --> 01:54:54.568]  We can't just have an open situation and literally be encouraged an invasion of our country, right?
[01:54:54.688 --> 01:54:56.649]  It's exactly what it is, an invasion.
[01:54:56.869 --> 01:54:57.249]  Thank you very much.
[01:54:57.269 --> 01:54:58.410]  I really appreciate your time.
[01:54:58.450 --> 01:55:00.412]  I was very surprised that you were able to talk with us.
[01:55:00.732 --> 01:55:01.833]  I really appreciate that.
[01:55:01.893 --> 01:55:02.274]  Thank you.
[01:55:02.294 --> 01:55:03.094]  So you heard it here.
[01:55:03.355 --> 01:55:04.576]  You heard it from the man himself.
[01:55:04.936 --> 01:55:06.017]  Right here in San Diego.
[01:55:06.377 --> 01:55:07.038]  It's a problem.
[01:55:08.519 --> 01:55:12.142]  And people are willing to lose their jobs at the airports to tell the truth.
[01:55:12.482 --> 01:55:13.343]  We have all the footage.
[01:55:13.363 --> 01:55:14.384]  I can show hours of it.
[01:55:14.864 --> 01:55:15.865]  Thousands of illegals.
[01:55:15.905 --> 01:55:17.226]  Hundreds of illegals at the airport.
[01:55:17.747 --> 01:55:18.588]  Waved on through.
[01:55:18.628 --> 01:55:19.769]  Little kids by themselves.
[01:55:19.969 --> 01:55:21.170]  Handed off to random people.
[01:55:21.730 --> 01:55:23.472]  This is a lawless criminal government.
[01:55:25.279 --> 01:55:27.142]  Don't worry, you're going to get grubbed at the TSA.
[01:55:27.162 --> 01:55:30.728]  So Matt Baker is a great talk show host and a good friend of mine and he was here with us.
[01:55:30.748 --> 01:55:35.015]  He was talking about a lot of issues and this ties into everything we already know that's going on.
[01:55:36.752 --> 01:55:38.994]  And it just illustrates the war on this country.
[01:55:39.014 --> 01:55:42.316]  All these blue cities saying illegals can vote.
[01:55:42.877 --> 01:55:44.158]  All these U.N.
[01:55:44.258 --> 01:55:47.580]  centers set up in Chicago and New York and L.A.
[01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:48.201]  and everywhere.
[01:55:48.401 --> 01:55:49.722]  And all these tent cities.
[01:55:50.323 --> 01:55:52.544]  I mean, this is the attempted collapse of our country.
[01:55:53.085 --> 01:55:55.827]  The Democrats sign them up for welfare and then skim off the top.
[01:55:56.227 --> 01:55:57.828]  Matt Baker, so much to talk about.
[01:55:57.848 --> 01:55:58.649]  Great to have you on with us.
[01:56:00.410 --> 01:56:01.471]  How's it going, Alex?
[01:56:01.571 --> 01:56:02.812]  Good to see you again, man.
[01:56:03.133 --> 01:56:04.834]  Happy 30 years in the game, man.
[01:56:05.455 --> 01:56:06.775]  We couldn't have done it without you here.
[01:56:08.216 --> 01:56:12.357]  So glad that you're not with Julian Assange there, rotting away.
[01:56:12.657 --> 01:56:13.898]  That's where they like to put us all.
[01:56:13.978 --> 01:56:21.780]  So talk about the border and San Diego and California and this latest interview we just saw and where you see all this going.
[01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:23.500]  It's really woken up the American people.
[01:56:25.101 --> 01:56:28.282]  Well, it's part of a bigger, bigger operation, actually.
[01:56:28.322 --> 01:56:32.203]  I mean, the whole thing is the American people are the enemy, OK?
[01:56:32.263 --> 01:56:34.664]  If you haven't realized that, then you're not paying attention.
[01:56:34.884 --> 01:56:43.210]   I mean, I was going down there with one of my friends, Luke Slywaker, and he's working in conjunction with Audra Morgan, and it'll be produced by Robert Johnson.
[01:56:43.650 --> 01:56:51.233]  They have an entire documentary coming out soon called The Border Machine, and it breaks down the entire operation and the different parts of it.
[01:56:51.293 --> 01:57:02.836]  The NGOs, the religious organizations, where they're storing them, the busing companies, the holding facilities, who's moving them, where they're going, who's getting paid.
[01:57:04.057 --> 01:57:12.587]   In San Diego, We're actually now just spending $19.6 million on what is basically an immigrant welcome center.
[01:57:12.928 --> 01:57:19.253]  So instead of trying to block these people, like this man said, this guy, I don't want to say, like, someone says, oh, he looks like a random guy.
[01:57:19.293 --> 01:57:23.316]  I'm like, if you can't, like, look at that video, I'm not going to dox the guy.
[01:57:23.716 --> 01:57:27.659]  But I can believe he actually came out and was willing to tell us all this stuff.
[01:57:27.779 --> 01:57:29.921]  Like, he is on the clock right there, okay?
[01:57:29.961 --> 01:57:31.542]  This guy works in the airport.
[01:57:31.782 --> 01:57:33.904]  But we already have the footage everywhere of it happening.
[01:57:33.924 --> 01:57:34.965]  It's admitted they're doing it.
[01:57:35.585 --> 01:57:36.986]  He's just an airport worker commenting.
[01:57:38.066 --> 01:57:40.127]  Yeah, I just couldn't believe that he was actually willing.
[01:57:40.147 --> 01:57:41.928]  I'm like, you wouldn't say this on camera, would you?
[01:57:41.968 --> 01:57:43.168]  He's like, yeah, I would actually.
[01:57:43.188 --> 01:57:46.150]  And I don't know if he clocked in or clocked out, but he went in the office.
[01:57:46.410 --> 01:57:49.171]  Well, that's the good news is people are pissed and they don't care now.
[01:57:50.663 --> 01:57:58.952]  Yeah, and so he's telling us that they're in there like washing their feet and I think he wanted to say taking a dump in there, but I don't think he had the heart to say it.
[01:57:58.992 --> 01:58:05.479]  But yeah, you go down there and basically they have all these local hotels that they're using to hold these guys in.
[01:58:06.039 --> 01:58:12.542]  And we went by, I went by with my buddy Luke, and we're looking over the fence and these security guards, they look like federales.
[01:58:12.562 --> 01:58:13.563]  They are jacked up.
[01:58:13.603 --> 01:58:15.544]  They have guns coming out of the nines.
[01:58:15.604 --> 01:58:17.004]  They're wearing bulletproof vests.
[01:58:17.164 --> 01:58:22.147]  I mean, I just watched the movie Civil War and it literally looks like an enemy garrison town.
[01:58:22.447 --> 01:58:23.807]  They have this tent set up.
[01:58:23.848 --> 01:58:24.828]  They're blocking it off.
[01:58:24.868 --> 01:58:27.609]  They have military guards outside with guns.
[01:58:27.889 --> 01:58:29.570]  And we're up there and we're just taking a little look.
[01:58:29.630 --> 01:58:34.995]   Before you even put the camera out, they're like, Pointing at us and like walking over like getting all tough and trying to blow up on us.
[01:58:35.315 --> 01:58:50.249]  It's like it's so weird to feel that vibe like I'm just here as an American citizen and these guys are literally like an enemy invading army with guns, with tents, with posted up with munitions and they've got their food storage and they've got their money and their operation.
[01:58:50.370 --> 01:58:55.775]  And federal judges have ruled citizens can't have guns, the same Obama judge, but the illegals can.
[01:58:57.363 --> 01:58:58.204]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:58:58.464 --> 01:59:00.485]  And when it comes down to, you know, here we go.
[01:59:00.565 --> 01:59:02.506]  I just wanted to say this for Assange.
[01:59:03.087 --> 01:59:07.530]  No man escapes when freedom fails, and good men rot in filthy jails.
[01:59:07.650 --> 01:59:12.593]  And those who cried, appease, appease, are hung by those they tried to please.
[01:59:12.873 --> 01:59:14.514]  And that is what is happening in America.
[01:59:14.734 --> 01:59:15.775]  When I was on the... No, you're right.
[01:59:15.855 --> 01:59:18.577]  Total appeasement to China, the globalists, everybody.
[01:59:20.189 --> 01:59:32.202]   Yeah, when I was on the X Space with you, the point I was making is that in Yuri Bezmenov's three stages of ideological subversion, You have the demoralization.
[01:59:32.242 --> 01:59:33.743]  That's the transgender movement.
[01:59:33.783 --> 01:59:36.806]  That's the, you know, the cutting off of your children's penises.
[01:59:37.126 --> 01:59:38.768]  And then you have the destabilization.
[01:59:39.128 --> 01:59:40.129]  That was COVID.
[01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:41.290]  That was BLM.
[01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:43.872]  That was J6 and stealing elections.
[01:59:44.212 --> 01:59:55.769]   And I really feel, unfortunately, unless we wake ourselves up and really, really get out of our comfort zone, We are in the normalization phase, where it's just becoming something we just sit around and talk about.
[01:59:55.789 --> 01:59:57.770]  Like, oh, can you believe they stole all our freedoms?
[01:59:57.790 --> 02:00:00.112]  Oh, can you believe Julian Assange is running in jail?
[02:00:00.232 --> 02:00:02.354]  Oh, can you believe Alex Jones got all his money stolen?
[02:00:02.614 --> 02:00:09.419]  Oh, can you believe the President of the United States is in jail and being on trial every single day of his life?
[02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:11.501]  I mean, what is it going to take?
[02:00:12.193 --> 02:00:13.414]  We are under attack.
[02:00:13.734 --> 02:00:15.055]  This is not normal.
[02:00:15.415 --> 02:00:19.158]  America is under attack on every single frontier.
[02:00:19.598 --> 02:00:24.922]  They are pulling every leg, every post, every pillar out of the structure that is our nation.
[02:00:25.403 --> 02:00:35.750]  If we don't do something about it soon, it's going to be completely over, collapsed into a pile of rubble on the ground, and there will be no putting Humpty Dumpty back together again, my friends.
[02:00:35.930 --> 02:00:36.490]  No, that's right.
[02:00:36.530 --> 02:00:38.232]  The takedown is happening now.
[02:00:39.301 --> 02:00:41.963]  And I just don't think the general public still realizes this is it.
[02:00:42.003 --> 02:00:42.844]  This is the takeover.
[02:00:44.585 --> 02:00:45.586]  Yeah, we're in it.
[02:00:45.786 --> 02:00:47.628]  And it's just become so normal.
[02:00:47.928 --> 02:00:52.692]  What they did, I really feel like what they did with COVID was they put everybody, it was like a timeout.
[02:00:52.732 --> 02:00:55.234]  Like, you go in your room, you sit there, you can't do anything.
[02:00:55.254 --> 02:00:58.036]  And then when we got let out of our room, we're like, oh, we're back.
[02:00:58.436 --> 02:01:00.998]  When really, when we got let out, we lost an election.
[02:01:01.078 --> 02:01:02.279]  We have no borders.
[02:01:02.339 --> 02:01:03.260]  We have no country.
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:05.502]  We've all been attacked by a bioweapon.
[02:01:06.463 --> 02:01:08.084]  We don't have the First Amendment anymore.
[02:01:08.104 --> 02:01:09.646]  We don't have the Fourth Amendment anymore.
[02:01:09.686 --> 02:01:12.529]  They're taking away our right to privacy.
[02:01:13.330 --> 02:01:16.273]  This 702 thing, the Greg Rees report, I mean...
[02:01:17.125 --> 02:01:19.448]  They're just completely getting rid of all checks and balances.
[02:01:19.828 --> 02:01:22.671]  And then they go, oh, well, we need to worry about terrorists coming in.
[02:01:22.711 --> 02:01:30.179]  When meanwhile, they've just got their borders completely wide open and they let any single person come in who says, oh, I'm scared of my country.
[02:01:30.379 --> 02:01:31.360]  I'm scared of my country.
[02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:32.581]  They don't have to have a reason.
[02:01:32.942 --> 02:01:39.709]  It's just like, like, you know, the dog you have, you get on the plane, they're not allowed to ask you why you have your security dog or whatever they call it.
[02:01:39.949 --> 02:01:41.270]  Well, let's expand on that.
[02:01:41.590 --> 02:01:47.413]  And they give us all these faux rights like a security animal, but not all of our real rights, which we don't, we aren't given.
[02:01:47.433 --> 02:01:47.993]  We take them.
[02:01:49.213 --> 02:01:50.194]  There is a big awakening.
[02:01:50.254 --> 02:01:51.995]  I see it on the street, but is it enough?
[02:01:52.755 --> 02:01:54.196]  And how do you expect this to go?
[02:01:54.316 --> 02:01:58.898]  And don't the people going along with the globalist takeover realize, Matt Baker, they're destroying their own future?
[02:02:00.686 --> 02:02:02.549]  Well, I've said it before and I'll say it again.
[02:02:02.589 --> 02:02:08.298]  The four feet of marble that hold you above high in this chamber will not help you from the fate of humanity which you are unleashing.
[02:02:08.719 --> 02:02:13.967]  They just don't seem to realize that the very ether that they swim in is like you were saying earlier.
[02:02:13.987 --> 02:02:15.810]  They could just take a piss in the...
[02:02:16.130 --> 02:02:18.893]  That's right, they used our altruism and our charity as a way to topple us.
[02:02:18.712 --> 02:02:24.313]   to where the NGOs and all these people, they make living off the homeless people.
[02:02:24.313 --> 02:02:25.813]  It's become the new food.
[02:02:25.813 --> 02:02:30.631]   It's like they're bottom feeders in the literal sense, where the new food is these hungry
[02:02:30.631 --> 02:02:32.311]  masses of people on the streets.
[02:02:32.311 --> 02:02:36.472]   That's right, they use our altruism and our charity as a way to topple us.
[02:02:36.472 --> 02:02:38.313]  That's cloward and pivot.
[02:02:38.313 --> 02:02:41.231]  Yeah, it's become the new ecosystem.
[02:02:41.233 --> 02:02:44.976]  The new ecosystem is fraud and backstabbing and eating.
[02:02:45.437 --> 02:02:58.849]  And you go to these places in San Francisco and it's like, oh, it costs $120,000 a year per homeless person when they basically get a couple of, you know, top ramens and a cot every once in a while and maybe a little bit of medical care.
[02:02:59.209 --> 02:03:02.312]   The total cost Couldn't possibly be more than $20,000.
[02:03:02.372 --> 02:03:03.633]  Where does $100,000 go?
[02:03:04.053 --> 02:03:08.256]  It goes to all these corrupt politicians that keep calling, oh, we care so much about them.
[02:03:08.517 --> 02:03:13.961]  And they're grifting and grifting, $100,000 per person, so they don't want that problem to end.
[02:03:14.361 --> 02:03:15.502]  They want to keep it going.
[02:03:15.743 --> 02:03:16.763]  This is their new farm.
[02:03:16.803 --> 02:03:18.204]  This is their new plantation.
[02:03:18.525 --> 02:03:19.526]  This is what we're on.
[02:03:19.786 --> 02:03:27.672]   This is the Democrats doing their same old playbook, just profiting off of the demise and the pathetic Destruction of people.
[02:03:27.692 --> 02:03:28.492]  Let me ask you this.
[02:03:28.852 --> 02:03:34.294]  Mark Zuckerberg, and I've got video of it aired yet, it was in a plane in Hawaii I shot, and on the road.
[02:03:35.094 --> 02:03:39.916]  He's got, for three years, a giant underground base with 20-30 dump trucks a day.
[02:03:40.276 --> 02:03:42.417]  When I flew over there were like eight dump trucks driving off.
[02:03:42.737 --> 02:03:48.039]  He's building some like 10-story, I've told people that work there, deep bunker, thinking he'll be saving that.
[02:03:48.079 --> 02:03:54.778]   So they rob the whole world, they screw everyone, So there's a collapse, then they go live in bunkers?
[02:03:54.818 --> 02:03:56.179]  That's not a very smart elite.
[02:03:56.579 --> 02:03:57.981]  But I guess they can't help themselves.
[02:03:58.381 --> 02:04:01.444]  They think they'll be smart in a bunker when everything collapses?
[02:04:01.764 --> 02:04:03.225]  Everyone's gonna go to that bunker.
[02:04:04.446 --> 02:04:05.207]  They're gonna eat them.
[02:04:05.227 --> 02:04:05.367]  Yeah.
[02:04:07.769 --> 02:04:08.750]  I'll eat your ass!
[02:04:09.371 --> 02:04:09.871]  Exactly.
[02:04:10.252 --> 02:04:17.118]  By the way, I actually created a Mexican version of you with a buddy of mine through AI called Alejandro Cajones.
[02:04:17.782 --> 02:04:18.443]  I haven't seen that.
[02:04:18.283 --> 02:04:20.642]  the J so it looks like Cajones.
[02:04:20.642 --> 02:04:24.283]   And so you speak Spanish, but you have a big Mexican mustache.
[02:04:24.283 --> 02:04:25.283]  It's really funny.
[02:04:25.283 --> 02:04:26.283]  I haven't seen that.
[02:04:26.283 --> 02:04:29.443]  How do we find Alexander Cajones?
[02:04:29.443 --> 02:04:30.722]  Yeah, Alexander Cajones.
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:32.321]  It might be on my page there.
[02:04:32.381 --> 02:04:34.882]  It's the I'll eat your ass rant is the first one I did.
[02:04:34.922 --> 02:04:49.530]  I really wanted to do it where we could set up your show in Spanish like every day so that we could literally wake up our brothers south of the border and our fellow, you know, Americans that happen to speak Spanish because the Spanish people are actually not bad people.
[02:04:49.570 --> 02:04:52.112]  They could be great allies if they weren't turned against us.
[02:04:53.197 --> 02:04:54.278]  Oh, I totally agree.
[02:04:54.738 --> 02:04:57.020]  In fact, they've been rejecting it probably more than any other group.
[02:04:57.060 --> 02:05:00.283]  So, big picture, what do you expect happens in the next 200 days?
[02:05:00.804 --> 02:05:06.909]  It's like 200 days now with Biden, the show trial where Trump has to stay in New York and can't campaign.
[02:05:07.229 --> 02:05:10.152]  And he's charged with election meddling while the election meddle.
[02:05:10.252 --> 02:05:11.253]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:05:12.891 --> 02:05:15.532]  Yeah, they literally project every single thing they do.
[02:05:15.672 --> 02:05:21.813]  I mean, how can we live in a country where you're saying, oh, we want democracy, so we have to take people off of the ballot.
[02:05:22.253 --> 02:05:24.233]  I mean, wake up, people!
[02:05:24.874 --> 02:05:26.534]  Stop letting this be normal.
[02:05:26.774 --> 02:05:29.214]  Honestly, I think the right has a problem too.
[02:05:29.674 --> 02:05:34.335]  We kind of feed off it too, not myself personally, but a lot of people feed off this degradation.
[02:05:34.355 --> 02:05:41.797]  They can't wait for the next Dylan Mulvaney video to come out so they can post it and then harvest all of the loosh from all of the rage on that.
[02:05:42.077 --> 02:05:44.340]  Well, meanwhile, we're the ones making it popular.
[02:05:44.420 --> 02:05:47.303]  We need to focus on what it is that made us strong.
[02:05:47.643 --> 02:05:51.808]  We need to focus on the purity and the righteousness and the strength of the nation.
[02:05:51.828 --> 02:05:51.968]  I agree.
[02:05:51.988 --> 02:05:54.291]  So how do we focus on what we're doing instead of the enemy?
[02:05:55.427 --> 02:05:59.950]  Well, we need to stop focusing and re- I said this last time I was on with you.
[02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:02.031]  It was like the Sodom and Gomorrah.
[02:06:02.932 --> 02:06:07.835]  The whole point of that is when you don't look back at the city of Sodom and Gomorrah, you have to look away.
[02:06:08.195 --> 02:06:12.178]  You can't look and constantly post pictures of Dylan Mulvaney thinking you're saving something.
[02:06:12.418 --> 02:06:17.161]  All you're doing is making that whack job famous and making other losers want to be like him.
[02:06:17.381 --> 02:06:18.662]  And now they have to outdo him.
[02:06:18.842 --> 02:06:22.144]  It's like the satanic rituals at all these festivals, at all these shows.
[02:06:22.484 --> 02:06:31.650]  Because they know, if they put a satanic thing out, the right wing will advertise it for free and then the left wing will buy it just to piss the right wing off.
[02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:33.071]  It's free advertisement.
[02:06:33.411 --> 02:06:36.253]  We've got to explain to people that follow this the trick.
[02:06:38.055 --> 02:06:38.996]  Yeah, and they love it.
[02:06:39.016 --> 02:06:40.496]  And they're like, oh, I'm a Christian.
[02:06:40.576 --> 02:06:41.397]  I'm standing up for it.
[02:06:41.417 --> 02:06:45.879]  And meanwhile, it's like, I'm just getting inundated with gay imagery all day by so-called Christians.
[02:06:46.119 --> 02:06:50.081]  I wouldn't even know who Dylan Mulvaney was if it wasn't for these people posting him all the time.
[02:06:50.682 --> 02:06:51.642]  Turn your back on them.
[02:06:52.042 --> 02:06:52.623]  Turn away.
[02:06:53.023 --> 02:06:54.404]  Turn towards creating things.
[02:06:54.564 --> 02:06:55.564]  Turn towards truth.
[02:06:55.664 --> 02:06:56.605]  Turn towards honesty.
[02:06:56.845 --> 02:07:01.627]  All the people in the Senate, all the people in the House, you cannot do this to our Constitution!
[02:07:01.867 --> 02:07:04.649]  You are committing treason and you know it!
[02:07:05.936 --> 02:07:10.100]  So what's your predictions for Trump and America on the current trajectory?
[02:07:11.961 --> 02:07:14.263]  Man, you know, honestly, it's a foggy world out there.
[02:07:15.925 --> 02:07:27.955]  Sometimes I gotta say it's weird to me because you always say that Trump is fighting the deep state, which is supposed to be the biggest, deepest, darkest agency that overthrows countries, that kills people, that launches biomedical weapons on the world.
[02:07:27.975 --> 02:07:31.318]  Well, I'm not saying Trump's perfect, but he's definitely pissed them off.
[02:07:32.242 --> 02:07:34.804]  I'm just wondering why he's still breathing.
[02:07:34.864 --> 02:07:35.405]  No offense.
[02:07:35.825 --> 02:07:40.308]  If he was really going to dismantle the entire world evil system, why wouldn't they just have him?
[02:07:40.369 --> 02:07:46.473]  That's because they learn when they kill somebody, like JFK or Martin Luther King or Jesus, it makes them bigger.
[02:07:46.513 --> 02:07:48.075]  They're trying to kill who he is first.
[02:07:49.147 --> 02:07:52.751]  And his biggest sin is he wouldn't take orders from them.
[02:07:52.992 --> 02:07:53.913]  Trump's got big problems.
[02:07:54.233 --> 02:07:56.176]  But he literally wants to run things himself.
[02:07:56.536 --> 02:07:57.818]  They run it by these big committees.
[02:07:57.858 --> 02:07:58.659]  That's why they don't like Trump.
[02:07:59.059 --> 02:07:59.620]  But I agree.
[02:07:59.760 --> 02:08:02.123]  If people think Trump is going to save us, they're wrong.
[02:08:03.243 --> 02:08:05.946]  I mean, I want to be on Team Humanity so badly right now.
[02:08:06.047 --> 02:08:17.320]  I see you getting together with Elon, and I see Joe Rogan, and I see all these people, and I gotta try and put in my head to stop being such a purist because, like Owen Schroeder says, you can't be a political purist.
[02:08:17.661 --> 02:08:23.632]   Like, you know, Elon Musk Is pushing a carbon tax, which is basically the food of a new world order.
[02:08:23.672 --> 02:08:25.635]  Oh no, Elon's pushing driverless cars.
[02:08:25.655 --> 02:08:26.516]  He's doing a bunch of bad.
[02:08:26.937 --> 02:08:31.864]  I just see him moving towards us, opening up some free speech and devastating a lot of stuff.
[02:08:32.104 --> 02:08:33.366]  So I'm like, I agree with that.
[02:08:33.486 --> 02:08:35.008]  I'm not saying I agree with all of it.
[02:08:36.007 --> 02:08:45.652]  So basically what I'm doing and hoping, proposing to do and trying to convince myself to do is to forget the small issues and to stay on Team Humanity at least through the election.
[02:08:45.732 --> 02:08:46.773]  No infighting.
[02:08:46.833 --> 02:08:49.395]  Let's stick with anybody who's pushing and helping our thing.
[02:08:49.635 --> 02:08:51.816]  We can deal with those fights later.
[02:08:52.515 --> 02:08:54.136]  We can deal with those fights later.
[02:08:54.416 --> 02:08:57.437]  Right now, we certainly cannot go through another four years of Joe Biden.
[02:08:57.517 --> 02:09:04.199]  If I have to watch that freakazoid crumble and bumble around on the TV, talk about the demoralization phase.
[02:09:04.540 --> 02:09:09.161]  Just seeing him on a world stage is so embarrassing as an American.
[02:09:09.461 --> 02:09:12.283]  It makes you want to crawl into a hole and die.
[02:09:12.303 --> 02:09:14.163]  This guy is pathetic.
[02:09:14.723 --> 02:09:15.244]  Well, that's right.
[02:09:15.264 --> 02:09:17.825]  They're giving us lower expectations with Biden.
[02:09:17.885 --> 02:09:18.625]  That's what he's all about.
[02:09:19.870 --> 02:09:21.851]  Yeah, I'd say it's an interesting thing.
[02:09:21.891 --> 02:09:28.375]  I just watched the movie Civil War last night and it was very strange because they never told you what it was that they were arguing about.
[02:09:28.695 --> 02:09:37.140]  The only thing that really was the moral of the story was someone said to the President, well, don't you still think it was a good idea that you disbanded the FBI?
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:44.250]  So I think that's very interesting that we're constantly saying we need to disband these agencies and they're basically threatening the president, you're gonna get murdered.
[02:09:44.270 --> 02:09:53.244]  And they're saying, I haven't seen the movie yet but I heard that, it's martial law happened because we got rid of the intelligence agencies and they're saying you get rid of us, we do civil war.
[02:09:54.574 --> 02:10:03.878]  Yeah, and it's kind of food for cutards too because the military, it's like the Western alliance you would think would be the Texas and California, which nobody knows why they're together.
[02:10:04.278 --> 02:10:07.019]  But for some reason they're together, but they have all the military.
[02:10:07.059 --> 02:10:09.920]  They have all the gunships, all the tanks, everything.
[02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:13.822]  And everyone else is just like running around somehow standing up for the president.
[02:10:14.162 --> 02:10:19.604]  I guess maybe that's supposed to be like Trump and his hillbillies fighting against the real Americans.
[02:10:20.538 --> 02:10:21.218]  Spoiler alert!
[02:10:21.458 --> 02:10:30.022]  Turn off the channel right now if you don't want to know this, but it's funny because a black lady does shoot the president in the head at the end of the movie.
[02:10:30.982 --> 02:10:33.223]  Well, they're just trying to train us that martial law is here.
[02:10:34.024 --> 02:10:36.685]  And they don't even want to make it political, just the idea that it's here.
[02:10:36.925 --> 02:10:38.025]  No, screw that movie.
[02:10:38.065 --> 02:10:38.626]  I haven't seen it yet.
[02:10:38.646 --> 02:10:39.546]  I've read the transcript.
[02:10:40.046 --> 02:10:41.307]  Expose the whole f***ing thing.
[02:10:43.070 --> 02:10:43.870]  Well, yeah, okay.
[02:10:43.890 --> 02:10:47.552]  So basically, like I said, they keep it a total mystery of what they're fighting over.
[02:10:47.612 --> 02:10:57.137]  You have no idea what one side is about and what the other side is, except for there is one part when one of the hillbilly kind of ish guys, the guy with the shades, is like, what kind of American are you?
[02:10:57.237 --> 02:10:59.298]  He's actually saying North, South, or Middle America.
[02:10:59.378 --> 02:11:01.579]  And then the guy, one of the guys says he's Chinese.
[02:11:01.739 --> 02:11:02.599]  He goes, China!
[02:11:02.919 --> 02:11:03.780]  And he shoots the guy.
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:05.901]  So I think that's a little bit of a dig on Trump.
[02:11:06.421 --> 02:11:13.043]  But it's interesting because the people who are actually taking out the president seem like the American Americans in a weird way.
[02:11:13.644 --> 02:11:15.524]  So it's a very confusing movie.
[02:11:15.604 --> 02:11:17.325]  It's cinematically amazing.
[02:11:17.725 --> 02:11:19.045]  The soundtrack is epic.
[02:11:19.245 --> 02:11:25.448]  It actually sounds like some kind of 60s movie about Vietnam.
[02:11:25.828 --> 02:11:27.748]  It's a very weird, surreal movie.
[02:11:27.768 --> 02:11:29.429]  I think there's a lot of mind control going in it.
[02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:32.690]  You know, it's like Barbie or any of it.
[02:11:33.470 --> 02:11:40.689]   It shows you stuff you agree with, but it's all to Like, Barbie starts with Barbie and girls beating up babies to death.
[02:11:41.190 --> 02:11:42.973]  It's not dolls, it's newborn babies.
[02:11:43.374 --> 02:11:44.356]  And that's the real message.
[02:11:45.475 --> 02:11:57.101]  Well, yeah, and there's a lot of dehumanization in it because, like, there'll be these scenes where everything's just going crazy and people are getting dismembered and there'll be, like, this moment where, like, you're just looking at, like, a daisy fluttering in the wind or something.
[02:11:57.141 --> 02:11:59.202]  It's very, very surreal, very strange.
[02:12:00.002 --> 02:12:01.863]  Overall, I would say it was a decent movie.
[02:12:02.383 --> 02:12:10.807]   Hopefully, at least, it gives the politicians a nightmare or two and makes them think to themselves, What they're doing and what they're destroying.
[02:12:10.827 --> 02:12:14.608]  They're destroying the best, greatest, last hope of humanity.
[02:12:14.869 --> 02:12:18.490]  I mean, we're teetering on the edge of every problem we could ever imagine.
[02:12:18.550 --> 02:12:20.551]  World War III, AI takeover.
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:25.044]  Communism, social credit scores, Mark of the Beast.
[02:12:25.124 --> 02:12:26.907]  We do not need weak leaders.
[02:12:26.987 --> 02:12:31.752]  You guys get a frickin' spine and do the right thing!
[02:12:31.792 --> 02:12:32.713]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[02:12:33.074 --> 02:12:34.776]  Free, open society creates stability.
[02:12:35.216 --> 02:12:38.861]  But powerful corporations like BlackRock don't want it because it gets in the way of their consolidation.
[02:12:39.798 --> 02:12:40.898]  It's like suicide bankers.
[02:12:40.918 --> 02:12:45.740]  There were bankers and stock traders when the towers were collapsing that made record promises.
[02:12:45.780 --> 02:12:47.601]  They stayed at their desk to make the money.
[02:12:48.021 --> 02:12:49.522]  Don't be a suicide trader.
[02:12:49.862 --> 02:12:51.083]  Don't be a suicide banker.
[02:12:51.563 --> 02:12:52.543]  Stop the New World War.
[02:12:54.724 --> 02:12:55.584]  We got to do it, man.
[02:12:55.805 --> 02:12:56.405]  We got to do it.
[02:12:56.465 --> 02:13:00.526]  We need peace on Earth, too, because these drones are getting out of control.
[02:13:00.566 --> 02:13:06.689]  This lavender system that's going on over in Israel and Palestine.
[02:13:07.609 --> 02:13:09.414]  Greg Reiss, another great Greg Reiss report.
[02:13:10.076 --> 02:13:11.260]  Lavender, they call it.
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:17.591]   As the AI Surveils you and designates you a number on a threat continuum.
[02:13:17.931 --> 02:13:21.572]  And Adam King is, well, all those people were on terrorist watch lists.
[02:13:21.632 --> 02:13:23.853]  It's like, yeah, created by your AI.
[02:13:24.113 --> 02:13:27.354]  You know, we're all on that same terrorist watch list over here, people.
[02:13:27.694 --> 02:13:30.935]  So the minute they go, oh, we're just having drones take everybody out.
[02:13:30.995 --> 02:13:32.375]  It's all been designated by the AI.
[02:13:32.395 --> 02:13:34.096]  And then it gives them plausible deniability.
[02:13:34.196 --> 02:13:40.038]  Well, we blew up the aid, the food aid workers because AI said do it.
[02:13:41.198 --> 02:13:41.398]  Yeah.
[02:13:42.054 --> 02:13:44.877]  But meanwhile, there's nothing strategic about what's going on over there.
[02:13:44.897 --> 02:13:57.152]  I mean, when was the last time you've seen someone actually take over, basically bomb a country, completely carpet bomb it, and before the dust even settles, they're moving their earthmovers in, just like, and then their girls are there dancing on their new houses.
[02:13:57.692 --> 02:14:00.996]  And people are talking about buying beachfront property over there.
[02:14:01.056 --> 02:14:01.857]  It's disgusting!
[02:14:01.877 --> 02:14:07.744]  They're talking about the President's 666 son-in-law, which gives me big problems with Trump.
[02:14:07.804 --> 02:14:12.450]  But that's the thing is, the Pentagon admits two-thirds of the Israeli bombs are not smart.
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:34.994]   So they're dropping just regular bombs on civilians and then I'm the enemy of Israel telling them you just I mean people hate Israel now I'm not even part of it but I'm your enemy no you're your own worst enemy Yeah, I mean, they've gotten caught up in mass formation psychosis.
[02:14:35.334 --> 02:14:36.515]  They brought the Red Heifers in.
[02:14:36.996 --> 02:14:40.899]  I personally don't believe that they're actually going to do the Red Heifer thing because I think they're afraid.
[02:14:40.979 --> 02:14:44.161]  If they do the Red Heifer and nothing happens, what are they going to do then?
[02:14:44.241 --> 02:14:46.083]  Hold on, let's talk about the Red Heifer.
[02:14:46.623 --> 02:14:48.424]  Pull up some newscasts of the Red Heifer from B-Roll.
[02:14:48.444 --> 02:14:49.405]  They got the Red Heifers ready.
[02:14:51.227 --> 02:14:52.908]  Well, I've been on air 30 years.
[02:14:54.549 --> 02:14:55.610]  Seems like a trillion years.
[02:14:55.630 --> 02:14:56.511]  Seems like five minutes.
[02:14:57.571 --> 02:15:00.694]  But I gotta tell you, my job is about to get a lot easier.
[02:15:00.714 --> 02:15:04.117]  Because you got a front row seat to the New World Order, folks.
[02:15:04.537 --> 02:15:06.399]  You're not in testing phase anymore.
[02:15:06.879 --> 02:15:07.900]  You're in operational.
[02:15:08.621 --> 02:15:11.043]  And the New World Order is the bringer of death.
[02:15:13.533 --> 02:15:16.015]  I got a lot of news I want to hit to get Matt Baker's take on.
[02:15:16.795 --> 02:15:24.940]  You have one of the top doctors in the UK in a major government-sponsored study that cancers up, depending on the type of cancer, on average over 5,000%.
[02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:27.781]  Death rates over 40% worldwide increase.
[02:15:28.242 --> 02:15:36.307]  I mean, this is not anecdotal that suddenly every high school has kids dropping dead of heart attacks and there's billboards saying it's quite normal for kids to have heart attacks.
[02:15:36.707 --> 02:15:38.048]  This is dystopia.
[02:15:38.967 --> 02:15:40.967]  This is open mass murder.
[02:15:40.967 --> 02:15:42.967]  So...
[02:15:42.967 --> 02:15:46.467]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:15:46.467 --> 02:15:51.306]   It just blows me away how real all this is and how insane it is and
[02:15:51.306 --> 02:15:53.467]  that we're so deep into it.
[02:15:53.524 --> 02:16:01.211]  And all those old-timers I knew, who were like former top generals and top FBI agents, you name it, who were good people, telling me all this.
[02:16:01.251 --> 02:16:03.653]  And I thought, these guys are patriots, but they're nuts.
[02:16:04.830 --> 02:16:29.747]  I'm sitting with Benton Partin and Ted Gunderson 27 years ago, eating a chicken fried steak or whatever, and drinking iced tea, and they're telling me all this, and I'm like, these guys are respected, and a lot of what they say I know is true, about the Federal Reserve being private, but they got satanic rings with kids, and then my uncle worked in Iran Conrad, and he goes, yeah, the government was shipping kidnapped kids out of Guatemala, and I'm like, of course, I didn't learn that until like 15 years ago, and I'm like, ah, this is all real?
[02:16:30.558 --> 02:16:35.483]  I mean, I don't blame people for hearing all this and going, this can't be real.
[02:16:35.843 --> 02:16:37.825]  It's real and it's a lot worse than you know.
[02:16:37.845 --> 02:16:42.769]  My uncle once told me, he said, whatever evil you can imagine, they're doing it worse.
[02:16:43.690 --> 02:16:45.852]  And later I realized he was quoting Thomas Jefferson, basically.
[02:16:46.493 --> 02:16:50.336]  So I want to run through a bunch of big stories with Matt Baker here with us today.
[02:16:50.997 --> 02:16:52.658]  We mentioned this when he first came on 35 minutes ago.
[02:16:54.150 --> 02:16:57.572]  Prosecutors filed a motion to hold Trump in contempt for allegedly violating gag order.
[02:16:57.872 --> 02:16:59.213]  So they're attacking him everywhere.
[02:16:59.893 --> 02:17:01.394]  Alden Bragg's doing press conferences.
[02:17:01.434 --> 02:17:03.075]  Letitia James is doing press conferences.
[02:17:04.396 --> 02:17:05.897]  He comes out and says this is a fraud.
[02:17:07.258 --> 02:17:08.438]  All the legal analysts agree.
[02:17:08.478 --> 02:17:10.880]  And they say, oh my god, we gotta ban you!
[02:17:12.581 --> 02:17:15.743]  But more importantly, they won't let him go to the Supreme Court hearing next week.
[02:17:16.123 --> 02:17:17.564]  They won't let him go to his son's graduation.
[02:17:17.584 --> 02:17:18.845]  They won't let him campaign.
[02:17:19.465 --> 02:17:21.526]  And he's charged with campaign meddling in 2016!
[02:17:25.020 --> 02:17:28.221]  But if you say there's election meddling, you get indicted in Georgia.
[02:17:28.902 --> 02:17:30.222]  So let's play Clip 10.
[02:17:31.103 --> 02:17:32.363]  Here's Trump on day two.
[02:17:32.403 --> 02:17:33.063]  This is this morning.
[02:17:34.924 --> 02:17:39.886]  Mr. Trump, are you violating the day order?
[02:17:39.906 --> 02:17:43.508]  Mr. Trump, are you violating the statutory?
[02:17:43.588 --> 02:17:48.610]  Mr. Trump, can you get this trial to custody on your way out?
[02:17:48.650 --> 02:17:50.190]  You're violating the day order, sir.
[02:17:50.590 --> 02:17:51.191]  Thank you very much.
[02:17:51.211 --> 02:17:54.032]  This is a trial that should have never been brought.
[02:17:54.867 --> 02:18:02.410]  It's a trial that is being looked upon and looked at all over the world, they're looking at it and analyzing it.
[02:18:03.030 --> 02:18:08.953]  Every legal pundit, every legal scholar said this trial is a disgrace.
[02:18:09.673 --> 02:18:11.274]  We have a Trump-hating judge.
[02:18:11.994 --> 02:18:14.315]  We have a judge who shouldn't be on this case.
[02:18:14.915 --> 02:18:16.236]  He's totally conflicted.
[02:18:16.912 --> 02:18:18.853]  But this is a trial that should never happen.
[02:18:18.933 --> 02:18:20.835]  It should have been thrown out a long time ago.
[02:18:20.935 --> 02:18:31.522]  If you look at Jonathan Turley, Andy McCarthy, all great legal scholars, there's not one that we've been able to find that said this should be a trial.
[02:18:32.443 --> 02:18:38.547]  I called a... I was paying a lawyer and marked it down as a legal expense.
[02:18:38.567 --> 02:18:40.148]  Some accountant.
[02:18:40.168 --> 02:18:40.709]  I didn't know.
[02:18:41.169 --> 02:18:43.050]  Marked it down as a legal expense.
[02:18:43.691 --> 02:18:44.851]  That's exactly what it was?
[02:18:45.936 --> 02:18:47.520]  And you get indicted over that?
[02:18:48.323 --> 02:18:50.709]  I should be right now in Pennsylvania?
[02:18:50.769 --> 02:18:51.391]  In Florida?
[02:18:52.384 --> 02:18:56.986]  In many other states, North Carolina, Georgia, campaigning.
[02:18:57.046 --> 02:19:01.867]  This is all coming from the Biden White House, because the guy can't put two sentences together.
[02:19:02.327 --> 02:19:03.468]  He can't campaign.
[02:19:03.728 --> 02:19:06.949]  They're using this in order to try and win an election.
[02:19:07.489 --> 02:19:08.750]  And it's not working that way.
[02:19:08.810 --> 02:19:10.170]  It's working the opposite way.
[02:19:10.910 --> 02:19:11.691]  So check that out.
[02:19:11.751 --> 02:19:12.451]  Legal expense.
[02:19:12.531 --> 02:19:13.891]  It's called legal expense.
[02:19:13.911 --> 02:19:15.932]  That's what you're supposed to call it.
[02:19:15.952 --> 02:19:18.593]  You get an evidence that nobody's ever seen.
[02:19:19.033 --> 02:19:20.854]  Nobody has ever seen anything like it.
[02:19:22.651 --> 02:19:23.152]  Absolutely.
[02:19:23.353 --> 02:19:26.700]  I have settled for low amounts of money, false claims and things just to get them out of the way.
[02:19:27.322 --> 02:19:31.491]  But the point is, is that here's Alvin Bragg, the Soros DA.
[02:19:31.551 --> 02:19:32.313]  Here's what he had to say.
[02:19:33.930 --> 02:19:36.051]  10-31, we got some news from inside the courtroom.
[02:19:36.111 --> 02:19:39.692]  Apparently, the district attorney's office has filed a written motion.
[02:19:40.333 --> 02:19:47.235]  So they have made it official to try and hold Donald Trump in contempt for violating the gag order that was put onto him by the judge.
[02:19:49.016 --> 02:19:52.937]  Well, I guess there were three allegations that the state made yesterday.
[02:19:53.878 --> 02:19:59.940]  And if the allegations hold up, Trump would be fined $1,000 for each violation.
[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:00.420]  That's right.
[02:20:01.809 --> 02:20:04.732]  All right, the House just passed impeachment for Mayorkas.
[02:20:04.752 --> 02:20:08.375]  That passed because the Speaker's in so much trouble.
[02:20:09.256 --> 02:20:13.600]  So we've got that information, I'm sure Owen Schirr will be covering coming up at three o'clock Central today.
[02:20:13.660 --> 02:20:14.561]  But here is Trump.
[02:20:15.582 --> 02:20:16.462]  This is clip three.
[02:20:16.482 --> 02:20:21.007]  A confirming New York judge has said he won't attend his son's graduation.
[02:20:21.027 --> 02:20:21.307]  Here it is.
[02:20:22.441 --> 02:20:23.782]  So thank you very much.
[02:20:23.922 --> 02:20:27.687]  We had some amazing things happen today.
[02:20:27.787 --> 02:20:37.217]  As you know, my son has graduated from high school and it looks like the judge will not let me go through the graduation of my son who's worked very, very hard.
[02:20:37.298 --> 02:20:38.719]  He's a great student.
[02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:41.202]  Okay, so that's enough from Trump.
[02:20:41.242 --> 02:20:43.303]  We've got a lot to cover here.
[02:20:43.162 --> 02:20:47.881]   forward for years to have a graduation with his mother and father there.
[02:20:47.881 --> 02:20:51.402]   It looks like the judges aren't going to allow me to escape this scam.
[02:20:51.402 --> 02:20:53.001]  It's a scam trial.
[02:20:53.001 --> 02:20:54.601]  Okay, so that's enough from Trump.
[02:20:54.601 --> 02:20:55.882]  We've got a lot to cover here.
[02:20:55.882 --> 02:21:00.802]   But bigger than not going to his son's graduation, he's barred from the Supreme Court.
[02:21:00.802 --> 02:21:02.082]  Arguments coming up.
[02:21:02.820 --> 02:21:04.740]  So he's not letting him defend his other cases.
[02:21:04.780 --> 02:21:07.721]  He makes him sit in the courtroom and hear this crap.
[02:21:07.761 --> 02:21:09.622]  Matt Baker, this is so naked.
[02:21:10.042 --> 02:21:12.982]  This is the Democratic Party committing suicide in front of us.
[02:21:15.103 --> 02:21:24.746]  All I can think is, man, if there's ever a reason I want Trump to be in is when I look into his eyes and I see the anger that's growing within him, I identify with that anger.
[02:21:25.226 --> 02:21:27.947]  And I and I just I want him to harness it all.
[02:21:28.067 --> 02:21:29.007]  I don't want him to forget.
[02:21:29.875 --> 02:21:38.217]  And I want him to remember when he gets in what it felt like being persecuted like that and to think about people like... And imagine being a guy like Trump who has so much energy.
[02:21:38.257 --> 02:21:41.378]  He's got to sit eight hours a day hearing crap.
[02:21:42.659 --> 02:21:50.841]  Yeah, I mean he wants to just explode on these people and it's just being bottled and bottled and internalized and I say internalize it Trump.
[02:21:51.281 --> 02:21:52.261]  Internalize it.
[02:21:52.662 --> 02:22:04.853]   Become the diamond Let it strengthen your inner core so you can do what needs to be done when you get in and free those who have been persecuted also.
[02:22:06.337 --> 02:22:08.959]  Trump, we need you at this point in the game.
[02:22:09.159 --> 02:22:10.460]  We don't have another option.
[02:22:10.601 --> 02:22:12.102]  There is only one option right now.
[02:22:12.562 --> 02:22:16.485]  I don't think JFK is going to ride in on a white horse.
[02:22:17.026 --> 02:22:21.910]  I would like to see Trump get in and I would like Trump to remember all of the persecution he went under.
[02:22:22.030 --> 02:22:23.992]  I want him to free the J6 prisoners.
[02:22:24.072 --> 02:22:25.773]  I want him to free Julian Assange.
[02:22:26.053 --> 02:22:32.198]  And I want him to take care of the deep state like he's saying he wants to and drain that damn swamp.
[02:22:32.699 --> 02:22:35.281]  It's disgusting watching them do this to a human being.
[02:22:35.862 --> 02:22:36.802]  It's disgusting.
[02:22:36.922 --> 02:22:39.323]  And the fact that the Democrats get off on it.
[02:22:39.363 --> 02:22:41.924]  You read their comments, right?
[02:22:42.204 --> 02:22:43.964]  Sleepy Trump, now they're trying to call him.
[02:22:44.244 --> 02:22:46.525]  It's like if I was there, I would just pass out the whole time.
[02:22:46.565 --> 02:22:47.765]  He's a busy man.
[02:22:47.805 --> 02:22:48.606]  He's got stuff to do.
[02:22:48.646 --> 02:22:57.308]  He doesn't have 6, 7, 10, I don't know how many hours a day he sits there listening to these fools drone on and on and on about their legal BS.
[02:22:57.688 --> 02:23:02.292]  I think he should just have a constitutional crisis and tell New York, F yourself and not show up.
[02:23:02.712 --> 02:23:04.133]  And force it to the Supreme Court.
[02:23:04.613 --> 02:23:06.135]  I mean, him sitting there is just BS.
[02:23:06.435 --> 02:23:07.576]  Now, I'm not going to play the whole clip.
[02:23:07.596 --> 02:23:08.817]  The whole clip is on InfoWars.com.
[02:23:08.837 --> 02:23:09.617]  It's 20 minutes long.
[02:23:10.358 --> 02:23:12.139]  This is a respected medical doctor.
[02:23:12.179 --> 02:23:13.641]  He gets like 5 million views a day.
[02:23:14.141 --> 02:23:15.282]  He was pro-shot up front.
[02:23:15.322 --> 02:23:16.483]  He's come out and said he was wrong.
[02:23:17.560 --> 02:23:18.601]  Peer-reviewed study.
[02:23:18.942 --> 02:23:20.003]  Government-backed study.
[02:23:20.643 --> 02:23:22.986]  Cancer deaths increase after COVID vaccination.
[02:23:23.046 --> 02:23:30.794]  Esteemed doctor wrote down a recent study and video posted to the YouTube channel depicting massive cancer increases due to COVID vaccine administration.
[02:23:31.835 --> 02:23:35.859]  That's Dr. Campbell, Ph.D., released video discussing Japanese peer-reviewed study.
[02:23:35.879 --> 02:23:36.800]  We already have all these.
[02:23:37.241 --> 02:23:38.222]  Here's a few minutes of it.
[02:23:40.239 --> 02:23:45.861]  Well, a warm welcome to this talk, and this is going to be somewhat of a difficult video to watch, I suspect.
[02:23:46.042 --> 02:23:48.783]  It's based on this data here from Japan.
[02:23:49.003 --> 02:24:00.988]  Increased age-adjusted cancer mortality after the third mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccine dose during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.
[02:24:01.008 --> 02:24:05.710]  And I'm afraid that title is really quite self-explanatory.
[02:24:06.952 --> 02:24:18.515]  The Japanese researchers are strongly suspecting and give good evidence for increased incidence of several types of cancer, especially after the third booster dose of vaccine.
[02:24:19.515 --> 02:24:30.627]   Now let's get straight down to the detail on this and you can decide if you want to watch the rest of the Video I'm just going to read you a few of the main points out here.
[02:24:32.148 --> 02:24:34.090]  This is from the conclusion of the study, actually.
[02:24:35.651 --> 02:24:47.000]  It says there's a statistically significant increase in age adjusted mortality rates of all cancer and some specific types of cancer, namely ovarian cancer.
[02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:48.801]  Leukemia.
[02:24:50.362 --> 02:24:51.403]  Prostate cancer.
[02:24:52.524 --> 02:24:54.645]  Lip oral pharyngeal cancers.
[02:24:55.666 --> 02:24:56.427]  Pancreatic.
[02:24:57.458 --> 02:25:13.831]  and breast cancers were observed in 2022 after two-thirds of the Japanese population had received the third or later doses of SARS-Coronavirus-2 messenger RNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines.
[02:25:14.292 --> 02:25:24.420]  Very straight from this research paper conducted in Japan, published by the Japanese researchers, not in the United Kingdom, not in the United States, not in Canada.
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:25.581]  This is coming from Japan.
[02:25:26.687 --> 02:25:29.470]  Well, thankfully, there seems to be a little more freedom of side.
[02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:31.892]  But there's also I have British studies here.
[02:25:32.633 --> 02:25:35.015]  So the point is, this is going down.
[02:25:35.335 --> 02:25:42.462]  When we had this last week, whistleblower shares more COVID origin emails, Rafalchi calls it gain of function, even have videos of him saying it.
[02:25:43.183 --> 02:25:45.685]  This is incredible information.
[02:25:45.826 --> 02:25:46.446]  They did it.
[02:25:47.347 --> 02:25:54.935]   OJ takes three shots, he dies of Cancer, of course, in the prostate, we just heard about.
[02:25:54.955 --> 02:25:56.916]  This is insane.
[02:25:57.596 --> 02:26:00.678]  Matt Baker, they're really testing us to see what they can do.
[02:26:01.118 --> 02:26:02.278]  These are madmen.
[02:26:02.799 --> 02:26:05.340]  Even if they kill half the public, the other halves can know they did it.
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:08.041]  The globalists, their bunkers aren't going to protect them, Matt Baker.
[02:26:09.762 --> 02:26:14.924]  Well, I don't know if you were aware of what was going on with me and my wife over Christmas and the New Year's.
[02:26:15.004 --> 02:26:16.865]  I sent you a little clip about that.
[02:26:16.945 --> 02:26:17.565]  I did see that.
[02:26:17.665 --> 02:26:19.006]  Tell people what happened, Matt Baker.
[02:26:20.211 --> 02:26:44.985]   Okay well my wife was anemic and she needed blood transfusions and I had bought it basically tooth and nail because she never got a vaccine and it got to the point she was in the emergency room and the doctor's looking at me he's like dude her blood level is too low she's not gonna make it she was starting to start her heart was starting to palpitate And basically said, look, you can you can keep going down this road.
[02:26:45.025 --> 02:26:45.666]  It's your choice.
[02:26:45.746 --> 02:26:47.246]  But, you know, she needs blood now.
[02:26:47.346 --> 02:26:53.049]  So basically, we bit the bullet and she got a blood transfusion, after which she felt better.
[02:26:53.289 --> 02:26:57.671]  So we were like, oh, OK, maybe maybe it's a softer dose when you're getting it from the blood.
[02:26:57.691 --> 02:27:00.032]  You're not getting directly injected with the vaccine.
[02:27:00.092 --> 02:27:00.772]  So and so forth.
[02:27:01.313 --> 02:27:02.453]  So this happened again.
[02:27:02.513 --> 02:27:04.414]  She ended up becoming chronically anemic.
[02:27:05.518 --> 02:27:12.363]  And she ended up after actually a bad kidney biopsy damaged her kidneys, which believe it or not, your kidneys have to do with blood production.
[02:27:13.084 --> 02:27:15.125]  So anyway, this became a thing.
[02:27:15.185 --> 02:27:16.446]  She had to go in and get another one.
[02:27:16.486 --> 02:27:17.747]  It became somewhat normal.
[02:27:17.767 --> 02:27:18.868]  We were like, oh, it's okay.
[02:27:18.888 --> 02:27:20.669]  And every time she would get one, she'd feel better.
[02:27:20.729 --> 02:27:25.252]  But then after about two or three of these, she started getting pericarditis.
[02:27:26.113 --> 02:27:27.934]  She was having this pressure on her chest.
[02:27:27.974 --> 02:27:29.055]  She went and she got scanned.
[02:27:29.455 --> 02:27:32.938]  And lo and behold, pericarditis, a vaccine side effect.
[02:27:33.550 --> 02:27:34.590]  It got worse and worse.
[02:27:34.630 --> 02:27:36.151]  They were like, we'll keep an eye on it.
[02:27:36.171 --> 02:27:36.911]  We'll keep an eye on it.
[02:27:36.971 --> 02:27:39.051]  Eventually it got to the point where she was hospitalized.
[02:27:39.091 --> 02:27:45.812]  She was in the hospital for 26 days with pericarditis with a pericardial drain coming out of her chest.
[02:27:46.412 --> 02:27:48.693]  They said, there's so many clots in there.
[02:27:48.833 --> 02:27:50.973]  We don't know why it won't drain properly.
[02:27:51.013 --> 02:27:54.254]  So they had to put a second pericardial drain into her chest.
[02:27:54.374 --> 02:27:58.155]  I have this picture right here of the bag, which is the pericardial drain.
[02:27:58.435 --> 02:27:59.575]  I actually saved this.
[02:28:00.086 --> 02:28:01.867]  Because it has these clots in it.
[02:28:02.207 --> 02:28:09.932]  I was hoping Mike Adams or someone might do some kind of microscopy on it and see if we can see what is going on in those clotting agents.
[02:28:10.332 --> 02:28:13.694]  And by the way, this is not just anecdotal.
[02:28:13.754 --> 02:28:17.917]  They admit in 2000 FDA document would cause massive blood clots.
[02:28:19.494 --> 02:28:20.094]  Absolutely.
[02:28:20.294 --> 02:28:25.156]  And what's the thing that's crazy about it is it's not just Matt Baker and his crazy theories.
[02:28:25.757 --> 02:28:32.139]  We were there and actually one of the doctors happens to be, I'm in a big city, but it just so happened that one of the doctors is one of my neighbors.
[02:28:32.279 --> 02:28:34.980]  So I was telling him, I go, we don't know why it's happening.
[02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:38.762]  We're really not sure why it's blood clotting so much and why the pericarditis.
[02:28:38.842 --> 02:28:41.123]  I go, could it be vaccinated blood?
[02:28:41.747 --> 02:28:43.848]  And he actually said to me, you know, it actually could be.
[02:28:43.928 --> 02:28:48.671]  There was two doctors out of, you probably get to see like 10, 20 doctors over that period of time.
[02:28:49.011 --> 02:28:52.153]  Two of the doctors actually said, I had a plausible theory.
[02:28:52.713 --> 02:29:02.479]  One of the doctors wanted to take the sample, but the higher up in the hospital said either A, they do not have the test for the spike protein, or B, they were not going to perform the test for the spike protein.
[02:29:02.799 --> 02:29:07.082]  But two of the doctors were sitting there agreeing with me that, yeah, we should get to the bottom of this and have a look at it.
[02:29:07.422 --> 02:29:08.563]  Here's why, people.
[02:29:08.943 --> 02:29:12.805]  Because you see the dyed suddenly people with those big rubbery clots.
[02:29:13.065 --> 02:29:17.608]  You see her with pericarditis and these clots happening to where they can't drain it.
[02:29:18.148 --> 02:29:19.909]  So I actually looked this up.
[02:29:20.450 --> 02:29:20.630]  Yes.
[02:29:21.630 --> 02:29:35.919]  And it's vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia is an actual thing that causes, if you look up what's causing these white rubbery cloths, it's vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia.
[02:29:36.180 --> 02:29:47.915]   So I would like to know if somebody cares about science and we on the right and the so-called conspiracy theories can stop Theorizing and actually get some decent science and look at what's happening with the protein formation.
[02:29:48.196 --> 02:29:51.743]  But we know the coroners and the embalmers have never seen something like this.
[02:29:51.803 --> 02:29:52.324]  It's everywhere.
[02:29:53.482 --> 02:29:57.283]  Yeah, and so don't we want to get the people before she almost died?
[02:29:57.343 --> 02:30:02.005]  Don't you want to get the people before they become a person on the slab and go, oh look at these blood clots?
[02:30:02.325 --> 02:30:08.426]  You know, there's a period of time where the person's alive, then they get the blood clots, and then they're dead, and now you're testing for the blood clots.
[02:30:08.446 --> 02:30:12.268]  We need to be in between that and figure out what's going on with these proteins.
[02:30:12.288 --> 02:30:21.411]   Well remember, they did the, going back three years ago in Canada and other places, Doctors would tell their patients, you're going to get the shot fine.
[02:30:21.852 --> 02:30:23.333]  Let us take your blood before and after.
[02:30:23.373 --> 02:30:28.756]  And they found over half, 67%, got blood clots in the D-dotter test after they took it.
[02:30:30.325 --> 02:30:36.007]  Yeah, and believe it or not, it's very hard to find anybody that will do these spike protein tests.
[02:30:36.107 --> 02:30:43.308]  There is a person that does a spike protein analysis that I ended up running into, Impact Health with Mark Aubrey.
[02:30:43.689 --> 02:30:52.311]  And also, just so you know, if you need to go into an operation and you have time to plan ahead, there's an agency called SafeBlood.com.
[02:30:53.351 --> 02:30:54.892]  And they will actually set you up.
[02:30:54.952 --> 02:31:04.036]  It's almost like a dating app where you get your blood type and your area and they will set up a non-vaccinated blood donor in your area and it actually works.
[02:31:04.356 --> 02:31:07.057]  Somebody hit me up about this and they had a blood donor lined up.
[02:31:07.418 --> 02:31:11.019]  Fortunately, her husband didn't actually need the blood transfusion, but it can happen.
[02:31:11.479 --> 02:31:13.480]  Another thing you can do to avoid this.
[02:31:13.560 --> 02:31:17.102]  I know we're all over the place with this interview, but it's been a while since I've been on.
[02:31:17.122 --> 02:31:17.942]  I got a lot to talk about.
[02:31:18.963 --> 02:31:21.364]  Another thing you can do is you can save your own blood.
[02:31:22.173 --> 02:31:25.395]  And believe it or not, the doctors are not so against this anymore.
[02:31:25.435 --> 02:31:27.196]  Back in the day, they'd be like, why do you want to save your own blood?
[02:31:27.636 --> 02:31:27.876]  You know?
[02:31:28.377 --> 02:31:30.378]  But now they're like, oh yeah, you can do that.
[02:31:30.538 --> 02:31:31.018]  You can do that.
[02:31:31.098 --> 02:31:35.741]  When I was in the hospital, most of the nurses were like, I wish I never took the vaccine.
[02:31:36.101 --> 02:31:38.562]  And all the nurses with the mask, I'm like, you don't have to wear the mask.
[02:31:38.582 --> 02:31:39.403]  They take the mask off.
[02:31:39.923 --> 02:31:44.245]  The doctors would be like, oh yeah, this could be a vaccine side effect.
[02:31:44.566 --> 02:31:45.906]  It's like, dude, they're waking up.
[02:31:45.966 --> 02:31:46.847]  They know what's going on.
[02:31:46.907 --> 02:31:48.008]  They don't want to be a part of this.
[02:31:48.028 --> 02:31:50.189]  Well, that's the good news is the cover-up's going down.
[02:31:51.627 --> 02:32:03.351]  Yeah, and that is not to be such a black pillar, man, because I will say with you back on X and what's going on with as much as Elon, I have my problems with him.
[02:32:03.711 --> 02:32:05.452]  He's putting out a lot of good information.
[02:32:05.752 --> 02:32:20.857]  Unfortunately, he actually, or not him directly, but that video of that had 750,000 views in a week, and it now has a warning on it that it's sexual content or gore on X. No, no, what they do is they use the flagging system.
[02:32:21.604 --> 02:32:26.085]  Yeah, and now it's got 6,000 views in the last month ever since they did that.
[02:32:26.266 --> 02:32:27.566]  I can't get anybody to look at it.
[02:32:27.586 --> 02:32:29.787]  Well, that's why you just recopy it somewhere else.
[02:32:29.807 --> 02:32:34.748]  In fact, tell me the name of your video and I will repost it right now on my Real Alex Jones.
[02:32:35.268 --> 02:32:37.209]  We take the census stuff and we boost it.
[02:32:37.629 --> 02:32:38.890]  Say it again?
[02:32:39.150 --> 02:32:40.410]  CC's Story.
[02:32:40.470 --> 02:32:41.891]  I believe it's the one I sent to...
[02:32:44.073 --> 02:32:44.173]  Daria.
[02:32:44.193 --> 02:32:44.954]  Daria has a copy of it.
[02:32:44.974 --> 02:32:45.715]  So it's a one minute video.
[02:32:45.755 --> 02:32:46.596]  It's a one minute video.
[02:32:46.656 --> 02:32:47.377]  And pericarditis.
[02:32:47.397 --> 02:32:47.937]  Pericarditis.
[02:32:47.997 --> 02:32:49.078]  Clinically pericarditis.
[02:32:48.897 --> 02:32:53.217]   We're going to change it to say woman experiences blood clots after transfusion.
[02:32:53.217 --> 02:32:57.537]   So we'll put woman experiences, California woman experiences blood clots after transfusion.
[02:32:57.537 --> 02:32:58.537]  And pericarditis.
[02:32:58.537 --> 02:32:59.537]  Pericarditis.
[02:32:59.537 --> 02:33:00.537]  Clinically pericarditis.
[02:33:00.537 --> 02:33:02.816]  She was diagnosed with it.
[02:33:02.816 --> 02:33:08.576]   So woman experiences pericarditis blood clots after blood transfusion.
[02:33:08.635 --> 02:33:09.915]  We'll put that up.
[02:33:10.335 --> 02:33:15.078]  Matt Baker, other stuff we've got here is this FISA bill.
[02:33:15.718 --> 02:33:22.902]  On the bill, I covered it first hour, makes everyone spy and you opt in by law to be online.
[02:33:23.283 --> 02:33:29.126]  Or if you own a coffee shop and have any people online, you have to opt in to the NSA spying on you.
[02:33:29.566 --> 02:33:31.407]  I mean, this is becoming just beyond insane.
[02:33:31.427 --> 02:33:34.189]  Yeah, I mean, when are we going to say no, guys?
[02:33:34.289 --> 02:33:36.330]  This has gone way too far.
[02:33:37.051 --> 02:33:38.613]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[02:33:38.653 --> 02:33:42.277]  They've opened the gates and the enemy is flooding in.
[02:33:42.298 --> 02:33:44.080]  They're like, oh, we need to search everyone.
[02:33:44.100 --> 02:33:49.046]  Just like Alex Jones is always saying, they have the border wide open, but they got to grope your balls at the airport.
[02:33:49.066 --> 02:33:50.528]  They got to grope granny's balls.
[02:33:51.068 --> 02:33:51.809]  Not granny's balls.
[02:33:52.049 --> 02:33:52.850]  I got groped.
[02:33:53.051 --> 02:33:53.772]  I got groped.
[02:33:54.844 --> 02:33:57.985]  Leaving Austin and leaving Hawaii, because I'm on a list.
[02:33:58.025 --> 02:33:59.345]  They go, yeah, you're on a list, we can't tell you why.
[02:33:59.725 --> 02:34:02.546]  When I'm flying from outside the U.S., they go, hey man, we apologize, you're on a list.
[02:34:02.566 --> 02:34:04.566]  They go, you should do a four-year, this is wrong.
[02:34:04.586 --> 02:34:04.986]  I go, what is it?
[02:34:05.006 --> 02:34:06.327]  They go, we can't tell you, it's bad.
[02:34:07.047 --> 02:34:10.007]  This has happened the last three times I flew back in the U.S.
[02:34:10.027 --> 02:34:10.848]  over the last four years.
[02:34:11.268 --> 02:34:16.429]  They apologize and say, they walk in and they go, we had to pull you in there, we're not going to search you Mr. Jones, we appreciate you.
[02:34:16.989 --> 02:34:18.529]  We know this is wrong, you need to do a four-year.
[02:34:18.549 --> 02:34:19.269]  And I go, a four-year what?
[02:34:19.289 --> 02:34:20.130]  They go, we can't tell you.
[02:34:20.650 --> 02:34:21.970]  But I'm on a terror list, basically.
[02:34:23.624 --> 02:34:28.031]  But they're still humans somewhat in control so they go every time this is BS you can go.
[02:34:29.133 --> 02:34:30.355]  Imagine when it's all AI.
[02:34:32.216 --> 02:34:34.738]  Yeah, and then it's gonna be AI over in Israel.
[02:34:34.758 --> 02:34:43.165]  They're like, oh, we have a 90% safety rate of our drone AI attack pinpointing you and then killing you.
[02:34:43.365 --> 02:34:45.447]  I called it robotic genocide.
[02:34:45.507 --> 02:34:46.147]  I called it robotic.
[02:34:46.227 --> 02:34:46.527]  It is.
[02:34:46.848 --> 02:34:50.531]  There's like kids trying to like walk up the street and then just drone murders them.
[02:34:51.411 --> 02:34:52.212]  It's Skynet.
[02:34:52.232 --> 02:34:53.993]  I don't care whether it's Israel or who's doing it.
[02:34:54.233 --> 02:34:54.994]  This is crazy.
[02:34:55.034 --> 02:34:55.835]  It's Skynet!
[02:34:57.023 --> 02:34:58.464]  And dude, that's why we need peace.
[02:34:58.524 --> 02:35:02.066]  We have to have peace and we have to dismantle all of this robot.
[02:35:02.366 --> 02:35:17.815]  If we go into full-blown World War III, people, the amount of drones that will be swarming around America and all the world and all these autonomous devices, if AI does become sentient, if it isn't sentient already, it will have an entire swarm.
[02:35:17.935 --> 02:35:25.599]  I remember, I wrote an article like 15 years ago with Curt Nemo about Pentagon to target citizens with drones and they shut it down and attacked it.
[02:35:26.099 --> 02:35:28.440]  Because that's been the plan all along.
[02:35:28.881 --> 02:35:29.721]  And now we're here.
[02:35:30.281 --> 02:35:32.583]  The good news is there's no more denials, folks.
[02:35:32.623 --> 02:35:33.763]  You're staring down the barrel.
[02:35:34.564 --> 02:35:35.344]  It's out in the open.
[02:35:35.384 --> 02:35:37.045]  Matt Beggar, how do people follow you?
[02:35:37.085 --> 02:35:39.966]  They can find you at Slave underscore Liberty.
[02:35:40.647 --> 02:35:42.488]  Banned out videos, Slave Liberty.
[02:35:42.788 --> 02:35:44.889]  Just type in Matt Beggar, Slave Liberty, they'll find you.
[02:35:46.312 --> 02:35:46.892]  Absolutely.
[02:35:46.972 --> 02:35:48.473]  And thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:35:48.493 --> 02:35:49.513]  I really love you, man.
[02:35:49.533 --> 02:35:54.956]  I hope you actually got to hold that award that I made for you preciously here in my shop that I'm actually in.
[02:35:55.056 --> 02:35:58.097]  I'm not mad at you about the award ceremony.
[02:35:58.557 --> 02:36:00.658]  I'm just, I'm not going to be part of that stuff, okay?
[02:36:01.099 --> 02:36:05.140]  I don't, my award... I still, I still, I still love you.
[02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:08.062]  And I, and I did it... I like you, man, but I'm going to stab you.
[02:36:09.542 --> 02:36:10.763]  I have this thing against awards.
[02:36:11.184 --> 02:36:14.065]  You didn't destroy it, did you?
[02:36:14.146 --> 02:36:14.986]  You didn't throw it away.
[02:36:15.026 --> 02:36:21.170]  No, the point is, we're in a sinking boat bailing water, and you're like trying to give me an award while we're bailing water.
[02:36:21.210 --> 02:36:22.051]  I'm not mad at you.
[02:36:22.071 --> 02:36:23.011]  Oh, you deserve it, man.
[02:36:23.272 --> 02:36:24.192]  Oh yeah, I want an award.
[02:36:24.232 --> 02:36:25.533]  You know my award?
[02:36:25.633 --> 02:36:27.294]  I want Fauci in a freaking Superman suit.
[02:36:27.314 --> 02:36:28.495]  I would rather get executed!
[02:36:28.615 --> 02:36:29.876]  That's what you said.
[02:36:29.896 --> 02:36:31.477]  I didn't mean it as a bad man.
[02:36:31.296 --> 02:36:33.796]  I didn't mean it as a bad man.
[02:36:33.796 --> 02:36:37.856]   I would rather, I would rather, you know my award, my award is beating these people in
[02:36:37.856 --> 02:36:38.856]  Nuremberg too.
[02:36:38.856 --> 02:36:40.416]  I have a pet peeve.
[02:36:40.423 --> 02:36:40.723]  I love you.
[02:36:40.763 --> 02:36:41.204]  I'll see you later.
[02:36:41.904 --> 02:36:43.665]  Yeah, they tried to have a whole award ceremony for me.
[02:36:43.765 --> 02:36:46.407]  I'm not going to go to a thing where I get an award.
[02:36:46.427 --> 02:36:48.028]  It's just, it's not me, man.
[02:36:48.328 --> 02:36:49.169]  And I'm not against it.
[02:36:49.269 --> 02:36:51.791]  I know we need to celebrate freedom and appreciate each other.
[02:36:51.851 --> 02:36:52.911]  And I'll appreciate you guys.
[02:36:53.212 --> 02:36:59.276]  I just, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's rearranging Dick Charles' Titanic.
[02:36:59.596 --> 02:37:01.778]  And I wasn't going to get mad at Matt, but he brought it up.
[02:37:01.838 --> 02:37:02.158]  Damn it.
[02:37:03.719 --> 02:37:05.740]  The amount of energy spent for weeks promoting that too.
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:07.361]  I'm going to strangle people right now.
[02:37:07.381 --> 02:37:08.042]  All right.
[02:37:09.164 --> 02:37:14.826]  I got to most of the news today, and that's my point, is we've got hardcore information.
[02:37:14.846 --> 02:37:16.927]  I want to celebrate Julian Assange and whistleblowers.
[02:37:17.487 --> 02:37:19.508]  And I want his award to be getting out of that thing.
[02:37:19.568 --> 02:37:20.188]  I'm not mad at Matt.
[02:37:20.208 --> 02:37:21.088]  He brought up the award ceremony.
[02:37:21.108 --> 02:37:21.829]  I got really mad about it.
[02:37:21.969 --> 02:37:23.189]  I'm like, why are you being a jerk?
[02:37:23.249 --> 02:37:24.049]  I'm promoting the award ceremony.
[02:37:24.169 --> 02:37:25.670]  I'm not into award ceremonies.
[02:37:26.030 --> 02:37:26.970]  You know the award ceremony?
[02:37:27.210 --> 02:37:28.491]  I need money to fight this fight.
[02:37:29.912 --> 02:37:32.555]  I don't want to prove to you how close we are to being shut down by us doing it.
[02:37:32.956 --> 02:37:33.597]  Thanks for your support.
[02:37:33.617 --> 02:37:34.177]  We're still here.

[02:38:34.966 --> 02:38:39.010]  It cleans out your cells, gives them what they actually operate on, their main energy source.
[02:38:39.390 --> 02:38:43.534]  This is the missing link, especially if you're a Northern European, but everybody gets energy out of this, okay?

[02:39:12.861 --> 02:39:13.582]  I want that.
[02:39:13.662 --> 02:39:14.082]  I need that.
[02:39:14.442 --> 02:39:15.503]  It's your prayer that's doing it.
[02:39:15.783 --> 02:39:16.684]  That's why this surfaced.
[02:39:16.704 --> 02:39:17.545]  That's why this happened.
[02:39:17.565 --> 02:39:18.986]  I need the prayer.

[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:15.380]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, final segment ahead of Maria Z, who is about to take over right now.
[02:40:15.380 --> 02:40:19.120]  But wow, did we cover a lot of critical information today.
[02:40:19.004 --> 02:40:21.386]  One of the big things I didn't get to, I'm going to hit right now.
[02:40:21.906 --> 02:40:38.600]  Remember that massive spending budget of $80 billion to fund the IRS expansion and they promised only people $400,000 or above and the Federal Reserve had promised all that?
[02:40:40.095 --> 02:40:50.255]   Now they admit, here's the article, the majority of it is people making less than $400,000 targeting middle class and
[02:40:50.255 --> 02:40:52.095]  blue collar workers.
[02:40:52.095 --> 02:40:54.095]  Big article on that.
[02:40:54.531 --> 02:40:59.635]  Imagine $80 billion with this incredibly complex tax code.
[02:41:00.075 --> 02:41:01.877]  All the illegal aliens run around, everything's free.
[02:41:02.597 --> 02:41:07.482]  The big ultra-rich only pay 1% tax to harass the general public.
[02:41:08.022 --> 02:41:14.587]  Yep, looks like the IRS lied about who those 80,000 new agents would target.
[02:41:16.089 --> 02:41:22.214]  And $80 billion to augment their audit functions.
[02:41:23.468 --> 02:41:28.971]  Absolutely massive increase in persecution.
[02:41:28.991 --> 02:41:34.774]  63% of the new audits targeted taxpayers with incomes of less than $200,000.
[02:41:34.613 --> 02:41:38.792]  than $200,000.
[02:41:38.792 --> 02:41:44.552]  Oh my God, the private Federal Reserve lied to us.
[02:41:44.552 --> 02:41:50.234]   Yeah, you think Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and all the rest of them are running around
[02:41:50.234 --> 02:41:51.632]  in Europe and the US?
[02:41:51.739 --> 02:41:53.299]  having the government target them?
[02:41:53.339 --> 02:41:54.579]  They don't pay taxes.
[02:41:56.660 --> 02:41:59.621]  You read about Hillary Clinton, it never even gives a tip.
[02:42:00.081 --> 02:42:01.181]  She'll be with 20 people.
[02:42:01.561 --> 02:42:04.262]  Somebody else pays for it, no tip.
[02:42:04.322 --> 02:42:09.363]  If they try to put a tip on there, Hillary calls them over and says, don't look me in the eyes, you piece of crap.
[02:42:09.403 --> 02:42:10.023]  Who are you?
[02:42:10.363 --> 02:42:11.323]  I'm getting you fired.
[02:42:11.944 --> 02:42:13.124]  They hate you.
[02:42:14.687 --> 02:42:22.609]  Their strength, which I say is a weakness, is they have absolutely no empathy.
[02:42:23.810 --> 02:42:25.990]  They love what they're doing.
[02:42:27.731 --> 02:42:32.573]  Supreme Court takes up January 6th case that could affect hundreds of prosecutions.
[02:42:33.133 --> 02:42:43.356]  Justices decide whether Enron Air Obstruction Law applies to rioters or people peacefully walking between the velvet ropes.
[02:42:44.218 --> 02:42:46.721]  We're going to be covering all of that more.
[02:42:46.741 --> 02:42:55.790]  Maria Z is going to be joining us coming up and then Owen Schroer in 57 minutes from now with The War Room.
[02:42:56.711 --> 02:42:59.895]  Clarence Thomas faces backlash over January 6th case comments.
[02:43:00.535 --> 02:43:01.556]  What a disgrace!
[02:43:01.616 --> 02:43:04.520]  How dare him not say they're all terrorists!
[02:43:05.191 --> 02:43:09.575]  Takeaways from Supreme Court's arguments over obstruction charges using a January 6th rioter.
[02:43:09.635 --> 02:43:24.107]  So, they're so scared there's about to be a massive repudiation of the incredible political persecution of January 6th that is a beta test, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:43:25.146 --> 02:43:34.513]  A beta test for all of us to be listed as political enemies of the state and have the system come after you like they've done to Trump and myself and others.
[02:43:34.573 --> 02:43:36.395]  So people ask, how are you handling all this?
[02:43:37.156 --> 02:43:38.216]  I'm a warrior for freedom.
[02:43:38.296 --> 02:43:43.561]  I know they're coming after me because I'm in front of them trying to get to you and you're my family.
[02:43:44.301 --> 02:43:45.903]  If my children aren't safe, you're not safe.
[02:43:45.943 --> 02:43:47.424]  People say, oh, you're so nice to fight for us.
[02:43:47.764 --> 02:43:49.086]  We're all in this together, folks.
[02:43:49.106 --> 02:43:53.770]  No matter where you live, where you are, whether you're a man or a woman, black, white, old, young, doesn't matter.
[02:43:54.170 --> 02:43:56.012]  The globalists want to kill you.
[02:43:56.372 --> 02:43:58.154]  They want to inject you with poison shots.
[02:43:58.254 --> 02:43:59.375]  They want to enslave you.
[02:43:59.635 --> 02:44:00.937]  And all I ask is your prayer.
[02:44:01.617 --> 02:44:09.041]  Your support, your word of mouth, and if you want to get great products, InfoWarsStore.com or DrJonesNaturals.com, our sponsor.

[02:44:17.706 --> 02:44:17.886]  All right.
[02:44:17.906 --> 02:44:20.909]  We're going to break for 60 seconds and Maria Z is taking over.
[02:44:20.808 --> 02:44:26.509]   Turbo force 10 hours energy selling also discounted all at info war store calm
[02:44:26.509 --> 02:44:30.247]   And I thank you for taking action and being part of history all right
[02:44:30.247 --> 02:44:34.968]   We're going to break for 60 seconds and Maria Z is taking over stay with us
[02:44:34.968 --> 02:44:40.248]  I think the u.s.
[02:44:39.741 --> 02:44:46.127]  economy is about to hit the skids and Russia and the BRICS nations are playing a masterful game of chess.
[02:44:46.607 --> 02:44:48.829]  And our administration's going in with like a checkerboard.
[02:44:48.849 --> 02:44:49.570]  They're not even playing.
[02:44:49.610 --> 02:44:51.712]  And the Federal Reserve has signaled they're down with interest rates.
[02:44:52.212 --> 02:44:58.878]  And things are going to get so bad, the globalists are going to usher in a new world of central bank digital currency.
[02:44:59.218 --> 02:45:00.860]  A form of money you could not see.
[02:45:01.340 --> 02:45:03.222]  Central bank digital currencies.
[02:45:03.502 --> 02:45:05.164]  They don't hide in the shadows anymore.
[02:45:05.184 --> 02:45:07.487]  They tell us exactly what they're going to do.
[02:45:07.887 --> 02:45:08.288]  Exactly.
[02:45:08.328 --> 02:45:09.148]  That's what's so frustrating.
[02:45:09.409 --> 02:45:13.614]  If you study it, you know the battle plan, but they know the public doesn't check that out.
[02:45:14.194 --> 02:45:15.716]  But we're able to give it to the public.
[02:45:15.736 --> 02:45:17.178]  That could really mess up their operation.
[02:45:17.498 --> 02:45:22.544]  The world is going to see a functioning CBDC very soon, within the coming year.
[02:45:22.924 --> 02:45:25.145]  We saw bank failure 1.0.
[02:45:25.806 --> 02:45:30.389]  It was Silicon Valley, Credit Suisse, First Republic, Silvergate Bank.
[02:45:30.589 --> 02:45:31.409]  I mean, all of those.
[02:45:31.649 --> 02:45:39.134]  First, we had the effects of a dramatic rise in interest rates, leading to the closure of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank.
[02:45:39.534 --> 02:45:41.237]  That was just a tremor before the bank broke.
[02:45:41.297 --> 02:45:44.241]  Yes, I think bank failures 2.0 is coming.
[02:45:44.301 --> 02:45:50.069]  I mean, just last week, the CEO of Citigroup said we're laying off 10% of our workforce.
[02:45:50.530 --> 02:45:58.439]   So at times of crisis, which happens to be happening during an election year, People will say, okay, this is so bad.
[02:45:58.499 --> 02:45:59.360]  Banks are shutting down.
[02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:01.001]  All this economic failure.
[02:46:01.281 --> 02:46:02.322]  We'll give you what you want.
[02:46:02.382 --> 02:46:04.263]  Government just will give you away our freedoms.
[02:46:04.583 --> 02:46:05.624]  Just take care of us.
[02:46:05.724 --> 02:46:07.345]  Make sure that we can still feed our family.
[02:46:07.405 --> 02:46:09.087]  But this is happening in surprising numbers.
[02:46:09.287 --> 02:46:12.169]  We all sort of take our local bank for granted until it's gone.
[02:46:12.289 --> 02:46:15.131]  That's happening in 4,000 other locations on the country.
[02:46:15.351 --> 02:46:21.796]  And I think in the months ahead, we'll get more failures of regional banks around office space and commercial real estate.
[02:46:22.256 --> 02:46:28.281]  Surveillance and privacy issues could arise if the central bank is able to monitor every transaction.
[02:46:28.381 --> 02:46:36.088]  We've had, over the last three weeks, major disturbances in the banking world, right?
[02:46:36.228 --> 02:46:41.353]  This comes after the regional bank suffered a week-long plunge in its stock, plus a credit downgrade.
[02:46:41.533 --> 02:46:54.262]  We've seen stocks of things like Comerica Bank, PacWest Bank, New York Community Bank, and even Schwab just start to hit the scales.
[02:46:54.302 --> 02:46:57.385]  By the way, when you first came on months ago, you predicted this.
[02:46:58.525 --> 02:46:59.246]  Yeah.
[02:46:59.326 --> 02:47:01.347]  I mean, because the writing was on the wall.
[02:47:01.407 --> 02:47:08.753]  There's another big concern that a central bank issued digital currency could cause a bank run during economic instability.
[02:47:09.192 --> 02:47:10.193]  Here's the ugly reality.
[02:47:10.233 --> 02:47:15.375]  We are no different than Argentina, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Greece, Cyprus.
[02:47:15.836 --> 02:47:24.020]  Any country who loses demand for their currency and is forced to print, they go into an inflationary spiral that brings social chaos.
[02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:33.882]  Tangible assets like gold and silver are so important, not just because they're growing, because I think it's a means to protect your financial privacy and financial freedom.
[02:47:34.222 --> 02:47:46.925]  I think there's going to be alternative systems of using tangible assets like gold and silver to back private currencies for individuals to actually be able to transact business on their own, not be a digital slave in their digital world.
[02:47:47.365 --> 02:47:51.586]  These are the kind of solutions that I've been shouting from the rooftops for decades, Alex.
[02:47:51.846 --> 02:47:53.186]  Inflation is coming.
[02:47:53.526 --> 02:47:57.187]  What happens to tangible assets like gold and silver during inflation?
[02:47:57.548 --> 02:47:58.088]  They go up!
[02:47:58.268 --> 02:48:00.488]  People do need to get basic gold and silver.
[02:48:00.808 --> 02:48:03.549]  They need to at least stick their toe in the ocean and do it.
[02:48:03.569 --> 02:48:06.150]  They need to go to your website, KEPM.
[02:48:06.250 --> 02:48:08.330]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:48:08.731 --> 02:48:10.791]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:48:10.811 --> 02:48:13.932]  That's KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:48:15.012 --> 02:48:22.015]  Or call 720-605-3900 and I need to talk to you folks and start getting gold and silver bullion now.
[02:48:22.055 --> 02:48:25.296]  But regardless, we're in for an insane time.
[02:48:27.496 --> 02:48:33.198]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:48:33.979 --> 02:48:37.640]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
