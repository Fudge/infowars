[00:00:12.628 --> 00:00:27.348]   Emotionally, it is easy to dismiss the work of Dr. Ana Maria Mielchia, for it is very disturbing.
[00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.735]  But her work is shown through scientific testing and backed up by government and NGO documentation.
[00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:41.241]  And the evidence shows that humanity has already been infected with cutting-edge surveillance nanotechnology.
[00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:46.726]  This is a follow-up to my last report on Dr. Mielchia's hydrogel research.
[00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:59.034]  New research shows that those who received the COVID shots emit a fluorescent orange glow in their faces that is visible under a UV light of 365 nanometers.
[00:00:59.474 --> 00:01:03.697]  And those who have been exposed to shedding emit this glow around their nose.
[00:01:04.577 --> 00:01:10.761]  After his wife was coerced into getting the COVID shot, PhD Justin Coy began his own research.
[00:01:11.182 --> 00:01:16.085]  He found that the more shots a person received, the more they glowed under UV light.
[00:01:17.483 --> 00:01:24.327]  The glow can be seen initially around the nose, and over time spreads throughout the entire face and into the neck.
[00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:33.572]  After a hot shower, filaments are expelled through the skin of the vaxxed, and these filaments also emit a glow under UV light.
[00:01:34.513 --> 00:01:40.957]  These filaments not only glow, but they have been shown to move on their own in spastic movements.
[00:01:42.677 --> 00:01:44.458]  And they are also attracted to people.
[00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:48.401]  In videos, they can be seen trying to latch onto a finger.
[00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:56.146]  And when a person who has received the shot has dry skin, these expelled filaments will become airborne.
[00:01:56.886 --> 00:02:01.049]  This could explain how shedding occurs from the vaxed to the unvaxed.
[00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:11.656]  The Pfizer trial document stated that an unvaxed individual in close proximity to someone who's been vaxed can be infected by inhalation and skin contact.
[00:02:12.316 --> 00:02:27.837]  In 2008, a biological nanotechnology pesticide designed to kill the brown moth in the state of California was deployed and appears to have included the same sort of fluorescent invisible micro dye that we see in the scientific research.
[00:02:28.718 --> 00:02:38.482]  Dr. Hildegard Stanninger tested individuals exposed to this nanotech pesticide and found that a glow could be detected in their eyes under UV light.
[00:02:39.142 --> 00:02:55.088]  Dr. Stanninger called this the Eye of Horus effect due to its similar appearance and claimed it was due to the use of fluorescent thiocyanate in the pesticide, which according to the literature would have been used to track the effectiveness of the dispersal.
[00:02:55.948 --> 00:02:57.870]  The idea has been around for decades.
[00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:13.829]  The Institute for National Security Studies, Non-Lethal Weapons, Terms and References, published in 1997, discusses an invisible infrared dye which is visible under UV light so that rioters can be later identified.
[00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:32.686]  Justin Coy points out how the genetic code for luciferase, a bioluminescent enzyme found in nature, is included in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, along with SV40, which could theoretically allow the luciferase to be written into the genetics of the recipient.
[00:03:33.407 --> 00:03:38.231]  Coy proposes that this could be what is causing the vaxxed to glow under UV light.
[00:03:39.432 --> 00:03:41.154]  The TRACE Act, H.R.
[00:03:41.174 --> 00:03:48.840]  6666, COVID-19 Testing, Research, and Contacting Everyone Act, was introduced in May of 2020.
[00:03:49.281 --> 00:03:56.066]  The bill authorizes the Centers for Disease Control to contact, trace, and monitor the population.
[00:03:57.435 --> 00:04:05.543]  In late 2020 and early 2021, people all over the world started noticing purple streetlights, which is the color of UV light.
[00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:18.816]  The quantum dot tattoo research, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, provided a way of detecting whether or not a person was vaccinated by including fluorescent medical information in the vaccines.
[00:04:19.436 --> 00:04:27.458]  Invisible near-infrared tattoos that would imprint beneath the skin to later be read by customized smartphones.
[00:04:28.179 --> 00:04:39.322]  In the scientific literature on quantum dot research, these fluorescent medical information tattoos have a similar appearance to the faces of those infected by the vax under UV light.
[00:04:40.462 --> 00:04:49.066]  You may or may not believe in biblical prophecy, but it seems clear that the ones running this diabolical program are using it as their playbook.
[00:04:49.666 --> 00:05:05.154]  From Revelation 13, And the second beast required all people small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark.
[00:05:06.174 --> 00:05:09.116]  But never forget, we still have free will.
[00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.391]  Greg Reese reporting.
[00:05:14.952 --> 00:05:19.155]  And the sleeping giant has awoken!
[00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:23.657]  The sleeper has awoken!
[00:05:24.678 --> 00:05:25.178]  Boom!
[00:05:25.198 --> 00:05:27.219]  Ha ha ha!
[00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:35.023]  And the plans of the New World Order are disintegrating as fast as they build their system around us.
[00:05:35.903 --> 00:05:38.545]  Destined to stand for only one year.
[00:05:39.915 --> 00:05:41.676]  Before it collapses.
[00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.097]  But they're far from completing it.
[00:05:46.318 --> 00:05:48.139]  We are living in the most incredible time ever.
[00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.419]  All right.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.322]  I say this every day now, and five years ago I might say it once every six months.
[00:05:56.642 --> 00:05:58.423]  This is an incredible broadcast today.
[00:05:58.443 --> 00:05:59.523]  They're always amazing.
[00:06:00.084 --> 00:06:03.111]   I must Cover all this news.
[00:06:03.151 --> 00:06:04.512]  So we had some other guests scheduled.
[00:06:04.612 --> 00:06:05.392]  I cleared the decks.
[00:06:06.093 --> 00:06:09.235]  We have one guest popping in on Julian Assange and the extradition.
[00:06:09.255 --> 00:06:13.718]  He spent 160-something years in prison for espionage here in the U.S.
[00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:15.999]  That guest is a lawyer.
[00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:17.961]  They're popping in the last 30 minutes of the third hour.
[00:06:18.521 --> 00:06:24.965]  But everything else is going to be news, clips, analysis, and I am supercharged and massively prepared today.
[00:06:25.866 --> 00:06:26.106]  All right.
[00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:38.135]  I have five stacks in front of me that illustrate the global awakening against tyranny and how fast it's moving, and the power we have as people awaken and learn the power they have.
[00:06:40.396 --> 00:06:48.160]  So I'm going to be hitting all of that first, then some of the best unintentional comedy ever.
[00:06:49.346 --> 00:06:57.049]  But this is an ongoing standard tactic by the think tanks, by the big endowments, the Carnegie, Rockefeller, Ford endowment that run the CIA.
[00:06:57.889 --> 00:06:58.850]  They do this all the time.
[00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.312]  They come out and they say things that are just total lies.
[00:07:05.872 --> 00:07:08.373]  They'll say ice caps discovered on Mars the first time.
[00:07:08.933 --> 00:07:13.015]  They were discovered 100 years ago with telescopes, and now probes have landed on them.
[00:07:13.075 --> 00:07:14.415]  But they'll just say discovered first time.
[00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:15.496]  Why do they do that?
[00:07:15.516 --> 00:07:16.096]  I'll explain why.
[00:07:17.739 --> 00:07:23.721]  There's other psychological tactics they use, where they say, you know, two men can have a baby, X and Y chromosomes don't exist.
[00:07:25.402 --> 00:07:27.783]  That's like saying water isn't dihydrogen monoxide.
[00:07:29.864 --> 00:07:33.065]  It's just absolute, the opposite of science, the opposite of facts.
[00:07:34.846 --> 00:07:39.708]  So you can call it unintentional comedy, but it's the joke's on us if we buy into this.
[00:07:41.108 --> 00:07:47.351]  Oh, Stanford Medicine Study identifies distinct brain organization patterns in women and men.
[00:07:48.766 --> 00:08:01.911]  Now that's not by anatomically looking at the structure of the brain or even watching the behavioral differences in males and females in every species, not just mammals or marsupials.
[00:08:06.673 --> 00:08:10.215]  That's already been done massively for hundreds of years and was well known.
[00:08:11.315 --> 00:08:15.617]  It's hooking people's brains up to computers and saying, oh, the brain waves are completely different.
[00:08:16.397 --> 00:08:17.218]  Uh, yeah.
[00:08:18.317 --> 00:08:22.219]  I'm not a medical doctor, I'm not a medical person, but I love reading medical journals.
[00:08:23.559 --> 00:08:24.660]  My dad is a physician.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:30.522]  But this is sixth grade science textbook when I went to public school.
[00:08:31.883 --> 00:08:33.003]  It's an absolute fact.
[00:08:34.444 --> 00:08:40.267]  And so I'm going to just talk about, coming up later in the hour, a few of the differences in the brain of men and women.
[00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:43.468]  But let's just give you a little tidbit for anybody who wants to look it up.
[00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:56.261]   The Greeks Didn't call themselves really medical doctors, but they were philosophers and they did some of the first drawings and sculptures of the anatomical shape of the body.
[00:08:56.762 --> 00:08:59.463]  And made the first statues that were really anatomically accurate.
[00:08:59.843 --> 00:09:01.324]  Masterpieces carved of stone.
[00:09:02.765 --> 00:09:07.447]  And they would cut open parts of the body and try to write about and guess what they did.
[00:09:08.227 --> 00:09:10.468]  And they knew the brain did the thinking.
[00:09:10.488 --> 00:09:12.129]  They knew the heart did the pumping of the blood.
[00:09:12.149 --> 00:09:14.990]  They even knew the liver was the thing that cleaned you out.
[00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.131]  They just figured it out.
[00:09:17.824 --> 00:09:19.365]  They're the original scientists, basically.
[00:09:20.065 --> 00:09:23.768]  The Egyptians, and the Greeks, and the Babylonians, and the Chinese, the Chin.
[00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:33.615]  And they all found the same thing, whether you go find 4,000-year-old manuscripts in Egypt, or 4,000-year-old manuscripts in China, they figured it out.
[00:09:36.617 --> 00:09:37.857]  Without any of the, quote, modern science.
[00:09:38.158 --> 00:09:41.220]  But the first thing the Greeks wrote about was looking at a woman's brain.
[00:09:42.681 --> 00:09:43.621]  Young or old, who died.
[00:09:44.842 --> 00:09:47.504]  They pulled them out, and they looked at them next to a male brain.
[00:09:49.091 --> 00:09:50.432]  And they noticed a lot of things.
[00:09:52.273 --> 00:09:53.955]  A, a male brain's bigger on average.
[00:09:54.055 --> 00:09:58.118]  That doesn't necessarily mean they have a chihuahua that's tiny as smart as a German Shepherd.
[00:09:58.138 --> 00:10:00.159]  But the point is, male brains are bigger.
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.281]  Male bones are thicker.
[00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:03.822]  Everybody knows that.
[00:10:03.902 --> 00:10:05.483]  Males are twice as strong on average.
[00:10:05.523 --> 00:10:06.404]  More stamina and everything.
[00:10:06.944 --> 00:10:07.825]  It's not putting women down.
[00:10:07.845 --> 00:10:08.305]  It's a fact.
[00:10:08.726 --> 00:10:09.586]  Men can't have babies.
[00:10:09.606 --> 00:10:10.667]  There's a bunch of stuff men can't do.
[00:10:12.448 --> 00:10:18.613]  But the Greeks noticed that there were three times the connections between left and right hemisphere of the brain.
[00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:30.009]  And of course now, going back over a hundred years, they've hooked up wires, they've had it totally down for 60, and they can see the difference between a male and female brain.
[00:10:30.969 --> 00:10:31.629]  The greatest difference.
[00:10:32.569 --> 00:10:41.351]  There are three times the connections between a female's left and right hemisphere than there is in the average male.
[00:10:42.431 --> 00:10:46.632]  Now some women have more of a male brain and have less connections between left and right.
[00:10:48.032 --> 00:10:50.313]  But that's why women in general are kind of taking everything in.
[00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:51.334]  They have women's intuition.
[00:10:51.354 --> 00:10:54.956]  They're kind of focused on everything and seem like they're daydreaming quite often.
[00:10:55.336 --> 00:10:55.757]  They're not.
[00:10:56.217 --> 00:11:08.885]  Their hemispheres are communicating with three times the, three times, the Greeks saw the brain, your nerve connections and said, well, these woman's brain is like more one and men's brain or two.
[00:11:09.445 --> 00:11:12.567]  And funny, that's what the science is once they hooked them up to electrodes.
[00:11:14.506 --> 00:11:20.649]  So this big article, Top of Yahoo, AP Reuters, oh my god, the brain of a woman and a man is different!
[00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.731]  It's ridiculous, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:27.311 --> 00:11:29.272]  Absolutely preposterous.
[00:11:29.972 --> 00:11:32.453]  Men and women's brains do work differently.
[00:11:32.994 --> 00:11:34.874]  Scientists discover for the first time.
[00:11:35.315 --> 00:11:39.616]  That's like scientists discover a big yellow ball in the sky for the first time.
[00:11:40.737 --> 00:11:42.978]  Scientists discover that fish live in water.
[00:11:44.088 --> 00:11:46.431]  Scientists discover that birds fly in the air.
[00:11:47.253 --> 00:11:50.337]  Scientists discover that if you cut your head off, you die.
[00:11:51.298 --> 00:11:52.460]  Why do they do this?
[00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:59.129]  Well, first they tell you there's no difference in all the movies and culture.
[00:12:00.029 --> 00:12:05.892]  Then they go further, and like every Netflix movie, every new movie, the women are the boss, the men are idiots.
[00:12:05.912 --> 00:12:12.676]  You know, it started back in the 70s, where male role models looked like morons, Archie Bunker, married with children, you know, the list goes on and on.
[00:12:12.976 --> 00:12:16.518]  And then they even bragged that the CIA funded that, and they had...
[00:12:19.008 --> 00:12:30.196]  John P. Holdren and a bunch of others have gone on TV, White House Science Czars, and bragged, oh yeah, starting in the 70s, we undermine the nuclear family and the image of males being the leaders.
[00:12:32.998 --> 00:12:42.884]  Paul Ehrlich, also famously in the 70s, went on TV and said, we're funding the Hollywood and TV executives to make sure that we undermine the family and the role of men.
[00:12:43.605 --> 00:12:46.327]  Not to make women empowered, but to break down our families.
[00:12:48.174 --> 00:13:00.963]  So I'm already kind of going into this, but later in the hour, and if I get bids on other news, or the start of the next, I'm not sure yet, because I'm going to spend at least 30 minutes on this, I'm going to... And by the way, I don't come in here and tell the crew what to pull up.
[00:13:01.423 --> 00:13:06.206]  They're just able, listening to me, they just type in whatever I say, and they find the documents, the bills, everything I'm telling you.
[00:13:06.606 --> 00:13:09.308]  Because by the way, men and women are one species.
[00:13:09.348 --> 00:13:11.930]  We're the species split in two for competition.
[00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:15.560]  And that's how all the different species are split up.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.441]  That's how we're designed.
[00:13:17.242 --> 00:13:19.184]  Not just mammals, not just homo sapiens sapiens.
[00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:24.690]  But did you know women have twice the blood-brain barrier of a man?
[00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:29.615]  That's why they're more resistant to autism.
[00:13:29.636 --> 00:13:32.439]  95% of autism is in men, is in boys.
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.562]  Did you know that they have twice as thick a blood-brain barrier as men?
[00:13:38.283 --> 00:13:46.449]  Did you know any medical doctor, any trauma surgeon, any battlefield surgeon will tell you that a woman can take more gunshots and more blood loss than a man?
[00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:53.174]  Did you know any doctor that delivers babies will tell you female babies are twice as tough as a male?
[00:13:53.954 --> 00:14:02.401]  To survive, not to win a fight, but to survive one, because they are what produces the next generation.
[00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.810]  Women are incredible.
[00:14:05.631 --> 00:14:12.673]  And if I had to pick one of the side of the species that I would say is more amazing, I have to say it's women.
[00:14:13.233 --> 00:14:22.015]  I mean, quite frankly, that's why all the ancient cultures worshipped the goddess, because they could just see these women have babies, these women give milk, these women take care of, these women are incredible.
[00:14:22.295 --> 00:14:27.857]  Women are incredible in their magical, holy role that God created.
[00:14:29.932 --> 00:14:35.075]  Men are expendable, designed to go out and provide.
[00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:41.719]  Our brains, left and right hemisphere, are barely even connected, so there's no confusion.
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.881]  There's absolute direct action.
[00:14:47.247 --> 00:14:49.148]  That's why a woman can't compete with a man.
[00:14:49.708 --> 00:14:56.011]  Oh, are there a few women and a few top percentage points that can compete with kind of the lowest percentage of professional athletes?
[00:14:56.031 --> 00:15:07.856]  Yes, there are some women, a very small percent, maybe one-tenth of one-one-hundredth, that can compete with the worst NFL players, the worst NBA players.
[00:15:09.737 --> 00:15:11.118]  You're talking about percentage points here.
[00:15:11.938 --> 00:15:18.084]   So, to sit there and act like they're discovering that there's a difference is Ridiculous.
[00:15:19.205 --> 00:15:20.327]  Men don't have a uterus.
[00:15:23.052 --> 00:15:26.076]  Men don't produce milk unless you give them a bunch of toxic hormones.
[00:15:26.137 --> 00:15:27.338]  It's not even real milk.
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:36.331]   And now the federal government came out in England and said, Giving men these toxic hormones, they can produce tiny amounts of milk is as good as a woman's milk.
[00:15:36.551 --> 00:15:37.531]  And I went and looked up the studies.
[00:15:37.831 --> 00:15:46.713]  We're talking about them producing 1 20th maximum of what a woman produces of this toxic milk.
[00:15:47.294 --> 00:15:48.994]  And they say it's as good as a woman's milk.
[00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:52.955]  It's all lies, people, to get you ready for transhumanism.
[00:15:52.995 --> 00:15:54.035]  So I'm going to stop there.
[00:15:54.055 --> 00:15:57.756]  I'm going to recap what I said and expand on it.
[00:15:59.076 --> 00:16:01.037]  Coming up later in the broadcast.
[00:16:01.397 --> 00:16:01.617]  Soon.
[00:16:03.578 --> 00:16:08.783]  Let me tell you what else we got, and then I'm going to get into action and victory and some really great examples of what's going on.
[00:16:12.726 --> 00:16:20.353]  They now have a whole bunch of new studies confirming that the Moderna and Pfizer shots caused massive blood clots, heart attacks.
[00:16:22.035 --> 00:16:25.257]  And again, they're using a psychological warfare tactic where they say, oh, but it's rare.
[00:16:25.758 --> 00:16:26.499]  No, it's not.
[00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:27.840]  It's killed 20 million people.
[00:16:29.807 --> 00:16:30.367]  We have that.
[00:16:30.867 --> 00:16:36.329]  We have Hillary Clinton has resurfaced, climbing out from under wherever she came from.
[00:16:36.349 --> 00:16:41.390]  We know, Chicago Mafia, her dad was the deputy head of the Chicago Mafia.
[00:16:42.151 --> 00:16:53.994]  She's crawled out from under her rock with Christina Amanpour of the UN to say that Trump's planning a military dictatorship.
[00:16:54.314 --> 00:16:55.835]  So, you know what that means.
[00:16:55.955 --> 00:16:57.195]  Of course, we know what she's been trying forever.
[00:16:58.786 --> 00:17:00.807]  Whatever she tells you Trump's doing, that's what she's up to.
[00:17:01.248 --> 00:17:03.989]  And I want to explain, when I talked about it a month or so ago, I made a big deal about it.
[00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:05.730]  And it's crazy.
[00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:07.791]  You know, I can talk about anything and it gets huge traction.
[00:17:08.132 --> 00:17:09.793]  I wanted that to get traction, got no traction.
[00:17:10.493 --> 00:17:13.135]  I say no traction, millions saw it and heard it, but it didn't become a big story.
[00:17:14.315 --> 00:17:19.819]  The Democrats have said their plan B is when Trump has such a landslide, he wins the election.
[00:17:20.796 --> 00:17:23.457]  That they're going to activate giant riots and burn down the country.
[00:17:23.757 --> 00:17:28.578]  It'll make the summer of rage in 2000, the summer of mostly peaceful protest, look tame in comparison.
[00:17:28.878 --> 00:17:32.459]  And then they're going to cause a constitutional crisis and try to force him from office.
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.520]  And they said that in 2020.
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:44.087]   They said if we don't win, we'll just hold an alternate Inauguration in Colorado, which is where the real U.S.
[00:17:44.107 --> 00:17:44.847]  government's based.
[00:17:45.247 --> 00:17:46.508]  It's not the backup government.
[00:17:46.908 --> 00:17:49.889]  It's the real COG, Cognitive Government Complex.
[00:17:50.149 --> 00:17:58.911]  And it was in the New York Times, big war game, and John Podesta, your Democrat Party top operative, saying, we're not going to accept it one way or another, and we're going to see civil unrest.
[00:17:59.392 --> 00:18:02.212]  They're going to activate all the illegal aliens and all the rest of it.
[00:18:03.593 --> 00:18:04.473]  So that's a big deal.
[00:18:04.513 --> 00:18:05.333]  That's what we're facing.
[00:18:05.753 --> 00:18:06.574]  How long to the election?
[00:18:06.594 --> 00:18:07.214]  Let's put it on screen.
[00:18:08.308 --> 00:18:15.091]  Because Trump is in their own skewed polls that sample way more Democrats than Republicans and hit Democrat voter pools.
[00:18:15.491 --> 00:18:17.412]  Trump's 15 points ahead nationwide.
[00:18:18.373 --> 00:18:21.414]  He's up to 7 to 10 points in all the battleground states.
[00:18:21.734 --> 00:18:23.195]  The real number is 30 points ahead.
[00:18:24.475 --> 00:18:25.396]  And those numbers are coming out.
[00:18:25.516 --> 00:18:35.940]  By the way, another big national, very respected polling group projected by Decision Desk.
[00:18:36.521 --> 00:18:36.961]  Look at this.
[00:18:38.996 --> 00:18:45.301]  Current Donald Trump vs. Joe Biden 2024 electoral map projected by Decision Desk with an index of over 100 scientific polls.
[00:18:46.502 --> 00:18:48.264]  Trump gets 312 delegates.
[00:18:50.105 --> 00:18:51.666]  Biden gets 226.
[00:18:51.787 --> 00:18:54.729]  A gigantic super landslide.
[00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:56.711]  Bigger than Ronald Reagan.
[00:18:57.631 --> 00:18:58.752]  Bigger than Richard Nixon.
[00:19:00.554 --> 00:19:02.976]  People haven't gotten numbers like this since George Washington.
[00:19:04.577 --> 00:19:04.937]  Look at that.
[00:19:05.037 --> 00:19:05.638]  Zoom in on that.
[00:19:06.258 --> 00:19:07.880]  That's why they're crapping their britches.
[00:19:10.177 --> 00:19:14.979]  Oh, you mean we didn't see through all the corruption before?
[00:19:15.499 --> 00:19:25.262]  They thought they could, you know, just indict Trump and have jury-less trials and have all these clowns up there talking about how hot rape is with no evidence Trump even touched her or ever met her?
[00:19:26.345 --> 00:19:27.805]  And then now they're like, well, why is nothing working?
[00:19:28.045 --> 00:19:31.746]  Let me explain something to the CIA and to the Carnegie Endowment that runs it.
[00:19:32.066 --> 00:19:33.286]  I'm gonna explain something to MI6.
[00:19:34.026 --> 00:19:35.347]  Listen, dumbasses.
[00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:43.468]  It was real easy for you to inherit all this Western power, and then people were asleep because they thought there was a social contract and were just living their lives and having a good time.
[00:19:43.788 --> 00:19:47.969]  It was easy to fool and lie to people when they were asleep and trusted you.
[00:19:48.489 --> 00:19:50.189]  People aren't asleep now.
[00:19:50.449 --> 00:19:53.410]  Most of them aren't, and the others that are asleep are waking up fast.
[00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:54.770]  Reality's dawning.
[00:19:55.450 --> 00:20:01.191]  People aren't asleep anymore, and they don't trust you, and they don't like you, okay?
[00:20:01.211 --> 00:20:03.832]  Let me explain that to you, alright?
[00:20:04.472 --> 00:20:13.233]  And you think with your strategy of just attacking me, and attacking Trump, and then you thought all that behind-the-scenes stuff a couple years ago that I'm not supposed to talk about?
[00:20:13.253 --> 00:20:13.953]  It's off-record?
[00:20:14.414 --> 00:20:16.814]  You think when you harassed Joe Rogan and messed with him?
[00:20:18.454 --> 00:20:21.775]  I could have told you real quick what was going to happen when you did that.
[00:20:22.543 --> 00:20:33.566]  You forced him to completely wake up and join us, and now he's as hardcore as it gets behind the scenes, but like a jujitsu expert, is rolling out his attacks slowly and watching his moves.
[00:20:34.146 --> 00:20:35.047]  And they already know all that.
[00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:41.709]  You thought messing with him and threatening him and doing a bunch of stuff that I'm... doesn't want me to tell you about?
[00:20:41.729 --> 00:20:49.211]  I was sitting there smiling like a Cheshire Cat three years ago when you guys started harassing him.
[00:20:51.325 --> 00:20:53.307]  What'd you think harassing Aaron Rodgers would do?
[00:20:54.107 --> 00:20:56.670]  Think he'd make him stick his tail between his legs and pee pee on himself?
[00:20:59.832 --> 00:21:01.213]  So you guys think we're like you?
[00:21:01.554 --> 00:21:05.277]  You think when you mess with my family, my family's gonna get messed with hard, folks.
[00:21:06.418 --> 00:21:14.805]  My dad this morning is so damn happy, 10 years younger being attacked like this, and he just said, son, I'm tired of you even, I want you to take the gloves off.
[00:21:15.746 --> 00:21:17.007]  They wanna fight, they're gonna get one.
[00:21:16.846 --> 00:21:19.846]  Who the hell do you think you're dealing with trash?
[00:21:19.846 --> 00:21:35.346]  It's that great scene near the end of that movie Elysium.
[00:21:35.346 --> 00:21:45.346]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:21:36.733 --> 00:21:38.534]  I don't like Matt Damon as an actor, but it's a good movie.
[00:21:38.574 --> 00:21:48.596]  And the head of the planetary elitist colony orbiting the Earth is ordering around these illegal commandos, he said, running around killing people.
[00:21:49.557 --> 00:21:53.858]  And she says, if you don't get this handled, you're going to be hung.
[00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:57.009]  He picks up a broken piece of glass.
[00:21:57.029 --> 00:22:01.290]  He goes, hey lady, we do the hanging and jabs it into her carotid artery.
[00:22:02.951 --> 00:22:06.412]  See, the New World Order took the gloves off.
[00:22:07.133 --> 00:22:09.654]  You're the ones that set your army of pedophiles loose on us.
[00:22:09.734 --> 00:22:13.435]  You're the ones that did all this while we were asleep and while we were decking it.
[00:22:13.475 --> 00:22:15.816]  We deserve some of the blame, but we didn't run it.
[00:22:16.196 --> 00:22:17.677]  We didn't do it consciously.
[00:22:18.137 --> 00:22:20.898]  You are guilty.
[00:22:24.235 --> 00:22:25.216]  And you're the bad guys.
[00:22:27.257 --> 00:22:28.978]  And your problems are only going to get worse.
[00:22:29.378 --> 00:22:33.521]  So please keep persecuting people.
[00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:36.263]  Please keep attacking people.
[00:22:36.603 --> 00:22:39.665]  Please keep threatening people.
[00:22:40.666 --> 00:22:42.166]  And see where it gets you.
[00:22:42.205 --> 00:22:46.365]  And case in point, we're gonna cover this right now.
[00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:55.905]   You know what, I don't do this to make you continue to tune in.
[00:22:56.114 --> 00:22:58.436]  I do it because you only... I'm the same way.
[00:22:58.756 --> 00:23:04.220]  If I don't whet your appetite and kind of like put it out there daily and pull it back, it won't have a big effect.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.781]  So this news is so important, I'm not going to cover it right now.
[00:23:06.801 --> 00:23:09.963]  I'm not going to make you wait long.
[00:23:09.983 --> 00:23:10.964]  We're going to break in a few minutes.
[00:23:10.984 --> 00:23:12.385]  I'm going to come back and hit this, okay?
[00:23:13.105 --> 00:23:19.470]  But let me tell you, it's like you wake up with your little kid and you smell bacon cooking and biscuits.
[00:23:20.447 --> 00:23:21.668]  Maybe it's pancakes.
[00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.810]  You know that smell.
[00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:23.651]  What's mama cooking?
[00:23:23.691 --> 00:23:24.872]  What's daddy cooking in there?
[00:23:25.713 --> 00:23:26.854]  My dad's a great cook as well.
[00:23:27.495 --> 00:23:29.677]  I never knew waking up in the morning my dad do breakfast a lot.
[00:23:29.717 --> 00:23:30.037]  I don't know why.
[00:23:30.077 --> 00:23:30.698]  It smells good.
[00:23:31.179 --> 00:23:33.221]  When you're a little bit older, you're 10 or 11, you start drinking coffee.
[00:23:33.661 --> 00:23:34.903]  Oh, I smell that coffee.
[00:23:35.784 --> 00:23:36.665]  That smells pretty good.
[00:23:36.685 --> 00:23:37.766]  I don't think I'm getting a cup of that.
[00:23:40.512 --> 00:23:41.473]  You know what I smell?
[00:23:41.973 --> 00:23:43.554]  I smell globalist blood in the water.
[00:23:44.095 --> 00:23:47.338]  I'm like a big old 20 foot long great white shark.
[00:23:48.098 --> 00:23:49.599]  And I smell a lot of blood.
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.502]  Of the political lifeblood running out of your veins.
[00:23:53.362 --> 00:23:54.804]  What's that?
[00:23:55.384 --> 00:24:10.183]  I smell fear. I've got my hands around your throat.
[00:24:10.827 --> 00:24:14.190]  The American people have got their hands around your throats.
[00:24:15.711 --> 00:24:20.834]  And when we're done with you, you'll wish you'd never been born, you trash.
[00:24:21.595 --> 00:24:22.675]  You murderers.
[00:24:23.396 --> 00:24:25.217]  You've killed 20 million innocent people.
[00:24:25.257 --> 00:24:28.980]  You've shot up millions of children that are flopping around like dead fish dying.
[00:24:30.541 --> 00:24:33.243]  You are absolutely disgusting filth!
[00:24:34.568 --> 00:24:46.500]  But you see, the power you had, and the levers, we could depopulate, we could control, we could corrupt the medical system by getting them on board with us, then we could do whatever we want, and we could use them all for guinea pigs, and it's gonna be so wonderful!
[00:24:47.641 --> 00:24:48.702]  Oh, we're so smart!
[00:24:50.924 --> 00:24:54.108]  You inherited the American and British Empire.
[00:24:55.478 --> 00:25:02.242]  And then you crapped it all away, selling out your own power base to China, because you'd make more money in the short term.
[00:25:02.602 --> 00:25:05.204]  You are not far-thinking, globalists.
[00:25:05.224 --> 00:25:06.484]  You pretend like you are.
[00:25:07.505 --> 00:25:21.073]  But if you were really far-thinking and looked at second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh order events, you would know that you have followed the absolute worst course you could ever follow!
[00:25:23.863 --> 00:25:32.251]  And my mission, even though I hate your stinking guts and I love victory over you and I shouldn't rebel, I'm a Christian man and when I was young I rebelled all the time.
[00:25:32.272 --> 00:25:38.558]  And it was certainly attractive in the culture and people liked that, but I repent of that.
[00:25:38.598 --> 00:25:45.044]  I was doing a little reveling, a little kind of skates on the edge of Satanism.
[00:25:45.505 --> 00:25:46.085]  I repent.
[00:25:47.079 --> 00:25:48.960]  Because that's not why we're going to defeat you.
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:55.781]  We're going to defeat you because you've got your foot on the neck of our children, and you're scum, and God's watching, and God hates your ass.
[00:25:56.442 --> 00:26:00.863]  And we're going to get you out of the way, and we're going all the way to the stars and beyond.
[00:26:01.283 --> 00:26:06.064]  Yes, to quote Buzz Lightyear, we're going to infinity and beyond.
[00:26:06.865 --> 00:26:07.845]  And it's going to be messy.
[00:26:08.365 --> 00:26:09.585]  And a lot of people are going to die.
[00:26:10.646 --> 00:26:23.438]   But at the end of the day, You know it deep down inside, Lord Rothschild, and all the rest of you, that you're going to be pushed into the fires of history.
[00:26:24.659 --> 00:26:27.783]  And it is you who will be destroyed, not us.
[00:26:29.335 --> 00:26:36.417]  You set the trap, you dug the pit for your fellow man, and now it is you that will be consumed, not us.
[00:26:37.477 --> 00:26:38.157]  Is that clear?
[00:26:38.957 --> 00:26:40.158]  I know it is.
[00:26:40.718 --> 00:26:41.118]  Good.
[00:26:41.818 --> 00:26:43.558]  Know your fate and embrace it.
[00:26:44.379 --> 00:27:10.398]   My fate is to throw everything I've got at you, and it is an honor, and it is a pleasure, and it is a sacred Absolute duty and I am so thankful to the God of the universe and the God of consciousness and the God of everything that is good that I have been put in this position with so many other great men and women to stand against this evil and to be persecuted by it.
[00:27:10.557 --> 00:27:18.356]   It is the ultimate blessing and is our God not incredible to continue to give us such incredible opportunities?
[00:27:18.356 --> 00:27:25.877]  I don't want to come back.
[00:27:25.573 --> 00:27:26.293]  A lot of good news.
[00:27:28.654 --> 00:27:29.514]  A lot of good news.
[00:27:30.715 --> 00:27:32.176]  There's not just evil in the universe.
[00:27:33.836 --> 00:27:36.138]  Evil's not the only thing that has a will.
[00:27:37.238 --> 00:27:38.539]  Discover your will.
[00:27:39.099 --> 00:27:40.340]  Discover your spirit.
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.121]  Like an antenna pointed at God.

[00:28:32.565 --> 00:28:34.805]  The people around the world are rediscovering their power.
[00:28:34.845 --> 00:28:35.746]  From Sri Lanka to India.
[00:28:35.605 --> 00:28:40.625]   I know you will not be disappointed because thousands of others have gotten it and it has five star reviews get
[00:28:40.625 --> 00:28:47.435]   turbo force now The sleeping giant is awakening the people around the world
[00:28:47.435 --> 00:28:52.865]   are rediscovering their power from Sri Lanka to India
[00:28:52.865 --> 00:29:02.605]   From France to Germany to the United States to Canada The people realize that an anti-human world is being built
[00:29:02.605 --> 00:29:08.246]   that we're being told we're obsolete and people are flexing their muscles.
[00:29:08.706 --> 00:29:10.588]  I've got a lot of examples of this I want to hit right now.
[00:29:11.448 --> 00:29:30.784]  But the first big one is the weaponization of the judiciary and the legal system, and how Soros took over almost all the DAs, many of the judgeships, close to half the attorney generals, and they sent them to these big seminars, lavish hotels, all over beautiful places in the world, mainly the Caribbean.
[00:29:32.711 --> 00:29:41.857]  Danny Willis, all of them go, and they teach them how to engage in criminal activity, and how to work with the media and think tanks, and how to engage in fraud, and how to rig juries, or not even have juries.
[00:29:42.958 --> 00:29:56.347]  And so people are watching this, and they're seeing it unfold, and they're realizing, wait a minute, if Donald Trump doesn't have any rights, or Alex Jones doesn't have any rights, I don't have any rights.
[00:29:58.322 --> 00:30:04.125]  Now the problem is the electronic voting machines and fraud in places like New York, where the Democrats aren't the majority.
[00:30:04.386 --> 00:30:05.506]  California's been red.
[00:30:05.626 --> 00:30:06.527]  It's always been red.
[00:30:06.547 --> 00:30:07.848]  Used to be redder than Texas.
[00:30:09.429 --> 00:30:13.151]  But if you get Democrat election officials over your systems, it's over.
[00:30:13.631 --> 00:30:20.435]  They're now appointing illegal aliens in San Francisco and in Chicago to run the election boards.
[00:30:21.256 --> 00:30:21.856]  I'm not kidding.
[00:30:21.936 --> 00:30:22.696]  I covered it yesterday.
[00:30:22.716 --> 00:30:23.517]  I'll cover it again later.
[00:30:25.222 --> 00:30:35.828]  So it's all about flaunting it in your face, rubbing your nose in it, they think will make you become conditioned to accept it, because again, they thought you were awake and bullied, people were asleep.
[00:30:36.948 --> 00:30:47.134]  Now when you're awake and somebody's punching you in the nose for no reason and rubbing crap on your face and trying to cut your kid's penis off, your little girl's breast off, you're like, what the hell?
[00:30:48.555 --> 00:30:52.317]  And they, so they reapply more intimidation, they reapply more attacks.
[00:30:52.377 --> 00:30:54.538]  So what about the truckers and more right now?
[00:30:56.471 --> 00:31:09.736]  So for folks that don't know, or don't pay attention, in Europe, in the United States, there's a lot of famous trucker protests and farmer protests that have changed federal laws, that have had huge effects, have changed national laws around the world.
[00:31:10.377 --> 00:31:25.379]   There was a case, what was it, a decade ago or so, that the trucker got 110 years in an accidental wreck, the judge just was persecuting the truck driver, and They shut down Colorado for four or five months.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:26.981]  Prices exploded.
[00:31:27.021 --> 00:31:28.522]  Businesses were shutting down, even big ones.
[00:31:29.283 --> 00:31:31.966]  And so the judge said, OK, 10-year sentence.
[00:31:33.307 --> 00:31:35.149]  That shows the power of the people.
[00:31:36.658 --> 00:31:41.380]  So, I knew this would happen last week when the truckers get pissed that they mean business.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:47.823]  Hardworking, competent people that also have a lot of time to listen, so they're very politically informed on average.
[00:31:48.443 --> 00:31:50.444]  I'd say 90% populist or conservative.
[00:31:51.045 --> 00:31:53.186]  There aren't many liberal truck drivers because they live in the real world.
[00:31:55.046 --> 00:32:22.551]   And so, I knew when this got announced last Thursday or so and it exploded, and it was the top trend almost every day on X and everywhere else since then, That when members of Congress came and shot their mouth off about the truckers, and when Democrats, prominent ones, came out and talked show host and attacked them and made fun of them, and said we'll just replace you with driverless cars and trucks and we'll just get you fired, they didn't understand that trucking is still one of the only things that's not centralized in this country.
[00:32:22.731 --> 00:32:28.555]  There's some huge companies out there, but the majority are middle-sized trucking companies or independent operators.
[00:32:29.545 --> 00:32:34.186]  And they understand they're all under attack, so they're not in a union, but they've got a basic solidarity.
[00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:35.547]  They stick together.
[00:32:35.647 --> 00:32:36.227]  They have to.
[00:32:36.247 --> 00:32:37.467]  It's a tough job.
[00:32:39.028 --> 00:32:51.871]  And they came out, and I've got a bunch of examples, but you've seen them, I'm not going to bore you with them, and said, you're idiots, you're all going to get fired, you're going to go bankrupt.
[00:32:51.931 --> 00:32:54.372]  No, they've got all the loads they could ever want to take around the rest of the country.
[00:32:55.202 --> 00:32:59.026]  And the truckers have said, hey, if you live there in the area and you're a small trucking company, you got to keep delivering.
[00:32:59.046 --> 00:32:59.766]  We're not mad at you.
[00:33:00.147 --> 00:33:01.468]  We're not going to, quote, take your lunch.
[00:33:01.488 --> 00:33:06.572]  We're not going to beat you up like leftist unions do of you across the picket line.
[00:33:08.494 --> 00:33:15.981]  And so now truckers are saying, OK, so you're now making fun of us and saying you're going to get rid of us and calling us Nazis.
[00:33:16.962 --> 00:33:18.904]  We're just going to now intensify it.
[00:33:20.831 --> 00:33:26.436]  And that's the thing about the left, they think they're dealing with an asleep population still, and to a great extent, you're not.
[00:33:28.058 --> 00:33:40.210]  And the more you act like the surly, arrogant, bravada, hubris, chutzpah-filled scum, the worse it's going to get.
[00:33:44.403 --> 00:33:48.125]  Trump now backs the trucker boycott against New York City over fraud verdict.
[00:33:48.706 --> 00:33:51.167]  But there is a bigger thing that just happened.
[00:33:53.388 --> 00:33:54.629]  And I've got the articles right here.
[00:33:54.929 --> 00:34:10.518]  Thousands of companies, including hundreds of large ones, in just the last four days since the ruling Friday, have said, we were going to move to New York, New York State, New York City.
[00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:13.320]  We're not now.
[00:34:14.232 --> 00:34:15.773]  And everybody else is voting with their feet.
[00:34:15.893 --> 00:34:20.155]  And great, you're bringing in illegal aliens, and you're bringing in mentally ill people, and you're bringing in criminals.
[00:34:21.155 --> 00:34:32.261]  And so it's taking New York from a dystopic craphole, a shithole, to a Mad Max, Road Warrior, Beyond Thunderdome scenario.
[00:34:32.661 --> 00:34:38.864]  And the globalists want to collapse things universally, and then buy it all up and rebuild it with Build Back Better, but that's not going to happen.
[00:34:39.204 --> 00:34:41.005]  You're just collapsing your own areas.
[00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:47.772]  So this is an example of solidarity, of people taking action, people waking up and saying, we're moving to Florida.
[00:34:48.632 --> 00:34:49.532]  We're moving to Texas.
[00:34:51.053 --> 00:34:58.155]  And then when the jobs and the industry and the votes are there, people are going to vote for their prosperity more and more because they're awakening.
[00:34:58.175 --> 00:35:00.856]  People when they were asleep voted against their own self-interest.
[00:35:02.736 --> 00:35:04.577]  And it's going to pull all the wealth out.
[00:35:06.075 --> 00:35:06.736]  of those areas.
[00:35:06.776 --> 00:35:09.618]  So New York will be worse than Detroit within a few months.
[00:35:10.219 --> 00:35:11.020]  It's already hellish.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.182]  And when it's being run right, it's a great place.
[00:35:13.762 --> 00:35:15.143]  Giuliani wasn't perfect, but he was running it.
[00:35:15.203 --> 00:35:15.684]  It was great.
[00:35:15.724 --> 00:35:18.967]  New York, great museums, restaurants, theater.
[00:35:19.527 --> 00:35:21.790]  I mean, it's a cool, big city.
[00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:22.550]  You're buzzing.
[00:35:23.551 --> 00:35:26.134]  Go out with friends on boats, drive around the Statue of Liberty at night.
[00:35:26.494 --> 00:35:27.995]  I mean, it doesn't have a bad vibe.
[00:35:28.055 --> 00:35:28.876]  At least L.A.
[00:35:28.916 --> 00:35:30.137]  has always had a bad vibe for me.
[00:35:30.197 --> 00:35:34.852]   I just I just feel like I'm Superman with kryptonite around my neck when I'm there.
[00:35:34.892 --> 00:35:35.793]  The spirit's so evil.
[00:35:36.373 --> 00:35:36.834]  You can feel it.
[00:35:36.894 --> 00:35:39.336]  New York didn't have a satanic feeling to it.
[00:35:40.557 --> 00:35:44.801]  I was there a couple years ago doing some podcasts and I had the LA feeling.
[00:35:45.822 --> 00:35:48.324]  And there was just pedo pride stuff everywhere.
[00:35:50.065 --> 00:35:51.546]  So they're destroying themselves.
[00:35:51.566 --> 00:35:55.290]  They're cutting off their nose to spite their face.
[00:35:57.331 --> 00:36:04.384]   And so Famous investor, billionaire Kevin O'Leary slams New York City ruling against Trump.
[00:36:04.404 --> 00:36:05.984]  He did it on CNN and on Fox.
[00:36:06.644 --> 00:36:09.405]  Both are excellent breakdowns and it's true.
[00:36:09.425 --> 00:36:13.785]  So I'm sorry for the workers and good people in New York.
[00:36:14.045 --> 00:36:15.346]  I like real New Yorkers.
[00:36:15.686 --> 00:36:18.526]  They can be Hispanic, black, white, Puerto Rican, great people.
[00:36:19.346 --> 00:36:23.027]  That's not even who New York now is like half illegal aliens that don't even know what the hell they're doing.
[00:36:24.847 --> 00:36:28.588]  And there's riots, a bunch of riots, the illegal alien centers beating up the police.
[00:36:30.506 --> 00:36:34.750]  And they can't play the race car because almost all the cops are black that were in that precinct.
[00:36:35.891 --> 00:36:37.432]  And it's just not working anymore.
[00:36:37.492 --> 00:36:40.334]  People see they're, again, going against their own self-interest.
[00:36:40.375 --> 00:36:42.416]  So, that's another big example.
[00:36:42.897 --> 00:36:53.146]  And of course, an even bigger one is, they had 80% uptake, or 75% uptake on the first poison shots three years ago, and then 50% uptake, and then 30%, and then 20% now.
[00:36:54.006 --> 00:36:55.508]  In some demographics, it's 15.
[00:36:55.548 --> 00:36:56.649]  Our guest said 15 yesterday.
[00:36:56.669 --> 00:36:58.090]  The real number, obviously, is about five.
[00:36:59.986 --> 00:37:02.547]  So 5% are taking their so-called fifth booster.
[00:37:02.587 --> 00:37:05.289]  So there is a learning curve here.
[00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:07.910]  And people are just voting with their action.
[00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:12.852]  And now the hospitals that fired hundreds of thousands of nurses and doctors are begging them back in the U.S.
[00:37:12.892 --> 00:37:13.513]  and all over the world.
[00:37:13.553 --> 00:37:16.394]  And they're begging the military back saying, OK, we'll sign a contract.
[00:37:16.694 --> 00:37:18.075]  You'll be taking experimental shots.
[00:37:18.495 --> 00:37:22.777]  They took a run at us and it blew up in their face.
[00:37:22.897 --> 00:37:24.038]  And they killed 20 million of us.
[00:37:24.358 --> 00:37:25.579]  And it's been rough and it's terrible.
[00:37:25.639 --> 00:37:27.880]  But I'm seeing really good signs everywhere.
[00:37:32.657 --> 00:37:33.777]  We're not going to skip this break.
[00:37:35.218 --> 00:37:41.300]  I'm going to come back and hit the Kevin O'Leary rant that is a hole-in-one.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.581]  If it was a golf, it's Tiger Woods, hole-in-one.
[00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:46.202]  I mean, it's Michael Jordan, you know, super fly.
[00:37:47.162 --> 00:37:49.983]  It is amazing, and it's what we're going to do.
[00:37:51.075 --> 00:37:54.397]  They want to put us under a social credit score, take everything away from us to control us.
[00:37:54.817 --> 00:37:58.920]  We're going to checkmate your ass, and we're going to take everything away from you, the New World Order.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.202]  And then we're going to indict you, and we're going to throw your ass in prison.
[00:38:02.462 --> 00:38:02.962]  We'll be right back.
[00:38:03.422 --> 00:38:07.104]  And we can start a populist movement worldwide against the New World Order.
[00:38:07.124 --> 00:38:07.104]  1776.
[00:38:07.905 --> 00:38:11.667]  And we can spend 30 years doing it.
[00:38:14.549 --> 00:38:21.642]   No, and then when the enemy made their move, Everybody would then go back to all the breadcrumbs we laid out and find out how to beat you.
[00:38:22.662 --> 00:38:23.463]  And it all happened.
[00:38:25.445 --> 00:38:27.126]  Because it wasn't my plan.
[00:38:28.407 --> 00:38:31.846]  It was God's plan.
[00:38:31.846 --> 00:38:38.807]  All right, so.
[00:38:38.807 --> 00:38:48.807]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:38:40.287 --> 00:38:49.951]  There are so many examples of the people waking up and saying, no, it's happening everywhere and realizing that when the system's at war with you and the system has broken the social contract, it's not your system.
[00:38:50.291 --> 00:38:51.151]  It's not legitimate.
[00:38:51.251 --> 00:38:52.432]  It is not just your right.
[00:38:52.972 --> 00:38:55.793]  It is your duty to abolish it and rebuild it.
[00:38:58.875 --> 00:39:00.835]  But we're not going to have a violent civil war.
[00:39:01.176 --> 00:39:01.956]  That's what they want.
[00:39:02.116 --> 00:39:03.476]  This isn't a civil war with each other.
[00:39:03.497 --> 00:39:05.197]  It's not a civil war with the government.
[00:39:05.237 --> 00:39:06.158]  The government's been hijacked.
[00:39:06.718 --> 00:39:09.199]  It's removing the hijackers.
[00:39:10.143 --> 00:39:27.312]  Again, if you're on an airplane flying as a tourist, let's say from London, England to Cairo, Egypt, and all of a sudden guys jump up with bombs and guns and they take over and put the pilot and co-pilot in handcuffs and put on the uniform.
[00:39:27.672 --> 00:39:29.473]  They do that sometimes and say, do what I say.
[00:39:31.354 --> 00:39:32.354]  Is the airline the enemy?
[00:39:32.414 --> 00:39:33.375]  Are the pilots the enemy?
[00:39:33.435 --> 00:39:34.475]  Are the stewardesses the enemy?
[00:39:34.515 --> 00:39:35.216]  The flight attendants?
[00:39:36.917 --> 00:39:37.057]  No.
[00:39:38.191 --> 00:39:38.991]  It's the hijackers.
[00:39:39.051 --> 00:39:44.153]  So you don't blow up the airplane to get the hijackers.
[00:39:44.173 --> 00:39:50.275]  You decide to let's roll and try to stop them.
[00:39:52.315 --> 00:39:57.117]  And so the globalists can only get away with this if we don't know they're the bad guys that are orchestrating it.
[00:39:58.097 --> 00:39:58.557]  They say that.
[00:39:58.597 --> 00:39:59.958]  They say we're bringing in this big change.
[00:39:59.978 --> 00:40:04.499]  We're going to blame it on the governments and the people and we're going to have them all fight each other and then we'll be the saviors and pick up the pieces.
[00:40:04.779 --> 00:40:06.460]  No, you're not because we're going to expose your ass.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:07.160]  And we have.
[00:40:09.514 --> 00:40:12.638]  Every popular icon now is exposing the New World Order.
[00:40:12.878 --> 00:40:13.899]  You can say, well, are they good?
[00:40:13.939 --> 00:40:14.540]  Can we trust them?
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.782]  They're coming over our side because we're winning.
[00:40:17.023 --> 00:40:18.204]  It's academic discussion.
[00:40:20.867 --> 00:40:21.768]  I know Tucker's for real.
[00:40:22.308 --> 00:40:23.790]  Whether Musk is or not, it doesn't matter.
[00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:25.152]  He's wreaking havoc.
[00:40:26.476 --> 00:40:27.877]  I mean, they thought Alex Jones was a problem.
[00:40:27.897 --> 00:40:29.777]  My God, he's just devastating them.
[00:40:30.417 --> 00:40:31.238]  In real time.
[00:40:31.878 --> 00:40:32.578]  They don't like it.
[00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:35.239]  Maybe he wants to replace them.
[00:40:35.259 --> 00:40:36.240]  Maybe he wants to take over.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:36.900]  You can say that.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.521]  But he sure as hell is ruining their world.
[00:40:39.761 --> 00:40:41.201]  He's wrecking their world.
[00:40:43.902 --> 00:40:51.245]  So, now, and I've got the reports right here, thousands of companies have announced they're leaving New York.
[00:40:52.409 --> 00:41:02.454]  Because of the judge's ruling, because everybody knows it's a fraud that has to have a brain, everybody knows you go to banks and they want you to value the real estate at a positive level.
[00:41:02.474 --> 00:41:10.579]  That raises the whole market, that ensures they're going to get more money, and every investment Trump ever did paid off and the banks tried to testify and the judge would shut them down.
[00:41:14.133 --> 00:41:34.518]  And people see that and they go, my God, if no jury even involved, if a judge can just take somebody's company away and take dozens of big buildings and golf courses away and put a federal receiver in running Trump's company right now that's a Democrat that works for Bill Clinton, if they can do that, they can do it to anybody.
[00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:39.839]  Of course, Trump's a big, powerful man, the President, with billions of dollars.
[00:41:41.459 --> 00:41:42.899]  They've cut his wealth in half already.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.600]  He's doing it for everybody.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:45.820]  It's amazing.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.541]  You can't sit back and complain about it.
[00:41:48.241 --> 00:41:49.081]  He's the man in the arena.
[00:41:49.121 --> 00:41:49.641]  Is he perfect?
[00:41:49.681 --> 00:41:49.962]  No.
[00:41:52.142 --> 00:41:55.063]  But it's easy to point out the strongman's stumble when you're not in the arena.
[00:41:56.363 --> 00:41:58.504]  Print me the arena speech, please, by Teddy Roosevelt.
[00:41:58.524 --> 00:41:58.764]  Thank you.
[00:41:59.824 --> 00:42:00.505]  Or just the heart of it.
[00:42:01.265 --> 00:42:01.925]  From Paris, France.
[00:42:05.666 --> 00:42:07.927]  So what I want people to understand is you're in a historic moment.
[00:42:08.908 --> 00:42:10.610]  And yeah, we've been getting our asses kicked forever.
[00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:11.351]  We were asleep.
[00:42:13.073 --> 00:42:13.894]  Now we're not asleep.
[00:42:16.537 --> 00:42:27.251]  And as you get up out of the bed, your nose is bleeding, your eyes black, and you've got a knot on your head, maybe even a stab wound, and you look at what's been stabbing you and biting you, and it's like a one-foot tall, bug-eyed, retarded gremlin.
[00:42:28.697 --> 00:42:36.860]  And you look at yourself and you're not asleep, you're like a 50-foot tall steely-eyed giant with giant arms and legs and huge claw hands.
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.521]  And the moment you realize your power, you're like, Gremlin, game over!
[00:42:42.242 --> 00:42:45.803]  Maybe the Gremlin bites your hand a little bit, pisses on you.
[00:42:45.823 --> 00:42:47.704]  That's about all it can do.
[00:42:49.024 --> 00:42:50.285]  And that's why they hate you.
[00:42:52.196 --> 00:42:55.017]  Because they're globalist parasites, and they know your potential.
[00:42:55.417 --> 00:43:02.519]  So they want to hurt you as bad as they can, so you never rise up spiritually, culturally, economically, and throw them off of you.
[00:43:02.759 --> 00:43:17.363]  But the minute you realize they're the enemy, BlackRock's the enemy, the Private Fellow Reserve's the enemy, the Carnegie Endowment's the enemy, the Rockefeller Foundation's the enemy, the moment you realize that and pull your support from them, metaphysically, culturally, spiritually, economically, it's game over.
[00:43:18.263 --> 00:43:28.028]   So here's the billionaire Kevin O'Leary Shark Tank, Attorney laying out what's really happening in New York and how the sleeping giant has arisen.
[00:43:29.213 --> 00:43:36.978]  This award, I mean, just leaving the whole Trump thing out of it and seeing what occurred here, and I'm no different than any other investor.
[00:43:37.078 --> 00:43:38.118]  I'm shocked at this.
[00:43:38.138 --> 00:43:43.462]  I can't even understand or fathom the decision at all.
[00:43:43.482 --> 00:43:45.063]  There's no rationale for it.
[00:43:45.143 --> 00:43:51.226]  And so let me give you a real-time experience I'm having regarding this, and I'm not the only one.
[00:43:51.667 --> 00:43:54.028]  It doesn't matter what the governor says.
[00:43:54.769 --> 00:43:57.810]   New York Was already a loser state.
[00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:00.171]  Like California's a loser state.
[00:44:00.191 --> 00:44:04.873]  There are many loser states because of policy, high taxes, uncompetitive regulation.
[00:44:04.893 --> 00:44:07.874]  It was already on the top of the list of being a loser state.
[00:44:08.575 --> 00:44:10.936]  I would never invest in New York now.
[00:44:11.096 --> 00:44:12.877]  And I'm not the only person saying that.
[00:44:13.197 --> 00:44:14.938]  And here's a real-time situation.
[00:44:15.038 --> 00:44:21.320]  In development in real estate right now, the hottest asset class is very high-end data centers.
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:24.742]  They cost anywhere from two and a half to three and a half billion each.
[00:44:25.382 --> 00:44:36.191]  They're very expensive, they require low power, you need permits, but most of the major institutions in the world need more data centers, and that's why developers like me are doing this.
[00:44:36.872 --> 00:44:38.513]  Now, you need power.
[00:44:39.114 --> 00:44:40.955]  So, New York has Niagara Falls.
[00:44:41.776 --> 00:44:50.263]  Normally, you'd consider that to put in one of these facilities, create 400 jobs, five more jobs for each of one of those, for auxiliary services.
[00:44:51.474 --> 00:44:52.414]  I can't go to New York.
[00:44:53.115 --> 00:44:57.256]  So I'm going to Oklahoma, North Dakota, West Virginia.
[00:44:57.857 --> 00:45:01.058]  Governor Stitt, Kevin Stitt, my staff have met with him.
[00:45:01.378 --> 00:45:02.879]  Governor Bergen, same thing.
[00:45:02.939 --> 00:45:03.759]  Governor Justice.
[00:45:04.079 --> 00:45:05.520]  Those are winner states.
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.300]   They don't do I have to do things like this.
[00:45:07.741 --> 00:45:10.322]  I have to syndicate that debt and all that equity.
[00:45:10.342 --> 00:45:11.983]  We're talking billions of dollars here.
[00:45:12.183 --> 00:45:19.947]  Do you think any foreign institution or any private equity firm or any pension fund would touch New York?
[00:45:20.647 --> 00:45:20.947]  No!
[00:45:21.427 --> 00:45:23.549]  And that's why New Yorkers should be concerned.
[00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:28.631]  The fine people of New York should ask themselves, why are we such a loser state?
[00:45:28.971 --> 00:45:30.452]  How are we going to attract business?
[00:45:30.652 --> 00:45:34.254]  It's not just the existing businesses that are fleeing out to Texas and Florida.
[00:45:34.874 --> 00:45:37.515]  What about new money like this that I'm talking about?
[00:45:37.756 --> 00:45:39.576]  Like a $4 billion data center?
[00:45:39.817 --> 00:45:41.938]  Not a chance I would put that in New York.
[00:45:42.338 --> 00:45:43.538]  Zero probability.
[00:45:43.879 --> 00:45:44.219]  Never.
[00:45:44.579 --> 00:45:48.701]  And so they've got a lot of work to do to find themselves getting out of this situation.
[00:45:48.741 --> 00:45:50.302]  This has all occurred post-pandemic.
[00:45:50.722 --> 00:45:53.003]  Winner states versus loser states.
[00:45:53.403 --> 00:45:55.925]  Look at Tennessee right now, fastest growing city in America.
[00:45:55.965 --> 00:45:59.227]  Nashville, winner state, good policy, competitive taxes.
[00:45:59.568 --> 00:46:03.270]  You've got to start thinking about this in the context of winners and losers.
[00:46:03.771 --> 00:46:05.772]  New York, mega loser state.
[00:46:07.433 --> 00:46:15.279]  So Kevin, what did you think of Governor Hochul saying, this is like a unique one and done because Donald Trump went too far and was so nefarious.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:19.182]  You guys, if you're just doing what you should be doing, you have nothing to worry about.
[00:46:19.282 --> 00:46:20.523]  But they're very worried about it.
[00:46:21.816 --> 00:46:22.676]  Yeah, we're very worried.
[00:46:22.756 --> 00:46:25.417]  Every investor is worried because where is the victim?
[00:46:25.957 --> 00:46:27.217]  Who lost money?
[00:46:27.837 --> 00:46:31.038]  This is some arbitrary decision a judge made.
[00:46:31.438 --> 00:46:34.858]  This policy and what this says, what does this say about the bar?
[00:46:35.358 --> 00:46:37.759]  The legal bar in New York?
[00:46:37.879 --> 00:46:39.659]  Aren't they going to question this judge?
[00:46:40.079 --> 00:46:40.479]  What is this?
[00:46:40.499 --> 00:46:43.440]  $355 million and there's dollars as a penalty and there's plus interest at 9% and there's no victim?
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:49.500]   dollars as a penalty and there's plus interest at 9% and there's no victim?
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:54.140]  I mean, I'm sorry, her words fall on deaf ears to everybody.
[00:46:54.204 --> 00:46:57.207]  There's nothing she can say to justify this decision.
[00:46:57.407 --> 00:46:59.129]  And this has nothing to do with Trump.
[00:46:59.529 --> 00:47:00.450]  Nothing to do with Trump.
[00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:01.431]  Forget about Trump.
[00:47:01.471 --> 00:47:02.933]  This is not a Trump situation.
[00:47:03.213 --> 00:47:05.054]  This is a New York problem now.
[00:47:05.335 --> 00:47:08.798]  The whole world is looking at this saying, what are you doing to yourselves?
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.481]  Alright, so here's the bottom line.
[00:47:12.962 --> 00:47:16.212]   Communist China Had all this Western money.
[00:47:16.232 --> 00:47:17.212]  It was the main investment point.
[00:47:17.252 --> 00:47:18.873]  Xi Jinping started seizing companies.
[00:47:18.973 --> 00:47:19.533]  Everybody left.
[00:47:19.933 --> 00:47:21.754]  India is now producing more than China.
[00:47:22.555 --> 00:47:23.335]  In three, four years.
[00:47:23.835 --> 00:47:24.616]  It's the same deal.
[00:47:25.136 --> 00:47:26.777]  The globalists have overplayed their hand.
[00:47:27.217 --> 00:47:29.578]  The army the globalists use is a bunch of corrupt lawyers.
[00:47:30.019 --> 00:47:33.120]  They're a bunch of snot noses that don't think second, third, fourth order.
[00:47:34.241 --> 00:47:34.681]  We do.
[00:47:35.421 --> 00:47:36.202]  They're losing.
[00:47:36.282 --> 00:47:40.464]  Yeah, they're gonna make it hell for me and Trump and the leaders in the fight, but it's okay.
[00:47:40.504 --> 00:47:41.484]  We're big boys.
[00:47:41.564 --> 00:47:42.205]  We're men.
[00:47:42.525 --> 00:47:44.106]  We're genetically designed to do this.
[00:47:44.206 --> 00:47:44.726]  We love it.
[00:47:46.338 --> 00:47:46.418]  Ha!
[00:47:47.159 --> 00:47:48.720]  You believe me, you?
[00:47:50.381 --> 00:47:51.122]  We're the number 13!
[00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:56.166]  Now when we come back, we've got a lot more news to cover.
[00:47:56.546 --> 00:47:58.087]  I need your support, great products.
[00:47:58.347 --> 00:48:00.709]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com now!
[00:48:00.929 --> 00:48:07.929]  InfoWars store now!
[00:48:07.929 --> 00:48:11.329]  Vector in Florida, thank you for holding, go ahead.
[00:48:11.757 --> 00:48:13.559]  I have to say, it really pisses me off.
[00:48:14.338 --> 00:48:20.042]  To hear when you say that only 2% of the people that listen to this broadcast buy products.
[00:48:20.883 --> 00:48:21.903]  Um, I'm a young man.
[00:48:22.123 --> 00:48:23.104]  I don't make that much money.
[00:48:23.424 --> 00:48:24.205]  I just bought a house.
[00:48:24.305 --> 00:48:25.086]  I just got married.
[00:48:25.106 --> 00:48:26.867]  But I buy the products as much as I can.
[00:48:26.967 --> 00:48:28.168]  I buy them almost every month.
[00:48:28.408 --> 00:48:31.070]  I've bought the iodine, the beets, the methylfolate.
[00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:31.810]  I've just tried it.
[00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:34.592]  It's absurd to me that you people are listening to this guy.
[00:48:34.612 --> 00:48:35.873]  I've listened to you for 10 years.
[00:48:36.173 --> 00:48:38.795]  He puts this show out here for free, and you're not supporting him.
[00:48:38.895 --> 00:48:42.718]  Our country is falling apart, but you've got millions of people listening to you not doing sh**.
[00:48:43.338 --> 00:48:45.821]  Excuse my French, but look look there's a glut of media.
[00:48:45.841 --> 00:48:46.782]  There's so much media.
[00:48:46.842 --> 00:48:50.665]  I'm not blaming the 99% 99% They never buy anything.
[00:48:51.186 --> 00:49:26.313]   It's just these are really good products, and if we just had 1% more by the products it would change the whole world so these are really great products to begin with We have the best turmeric out there 95% humanoid incredible anti-inflammation so good for your whole body We have all the other great products that have for sure I've been taking it for, I don't know, a couple weeks now and in my younger days I've experimented with stimulants and those things.
[00:49:26.493 --> 00:49:27.654]  It feels nothing like that.
[00:49:27.694 --> 00:49:29.155]  You feel like you're supposed to feel it.
[00:49:29.175 --> 00:49:32.096]  You're supposed to have energy, you know, and that's pretty much it.
[00:49:32.156 --> 00:49:33.397]  It doesn't feel like a stimulant.
[00:49:33.417 --> 00:49:34.698]  You just feel like you're supposed to be.
[00:49:34.818 --> 00:49:44.327]  And what it does is, it's the breakdown of folic acid that almost everybody, but particularly some people, northern Europeans, have a low breakdown of.
[00:49:44.708 --> 00:49:49.612]  So you just give yourselves the direct food that they operate off of and they clean out with.
[00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:52.175]  That's why Next Level Financial Energy is so important.
[00:49:51.995 --> 00:50:10.554]  Thank you for the call, Victor, and thanks for the plug.
[00:50:10.731 --> 00:50:12.132]  They discovered men and women are different.
[00:50:12.172 --> 00:50:13.473]  Yes, it's top headline in the country.
[00:50:13.913 --> 00:50:15.635]  It's all coming up, but here's more Kevin O'Leary.
[00:50:17.116 --> 00:50:29.404]  Wouldn't there be many companies who would not want to do business or loan money to people like yourself or investors if they know that they can get away with fraud and there's no recourse to protect them?
[00:50:31.354 --> 00:50:32.595]  Excuse me, what fraud?
[00:50:32.875 --> 00:50:34.556]  This is not about Trump anymore.
[00:50:35.036 --> 00:50:50.124]   When you get a developer that builds a building, and he says it's worth $400 million, and he wants to borrow $200 million from a bank, which happens every day, everywhere on Earth, including every American city, Every developer is an entrepreneur.
[00:50:50.425 --> 00:50:53.046]  They shine the light on their building and they say it's worth $400,000.
[00:50:53.347 --> 00:51:01.012]  The bank does its own due diligence, as was done in this case, because they're very good at it, the banks are very good, and they say, no, it's worth $300,000.
[00:51:01.692 --> 00:51:03.494]  We're only going to loan you $150,000,000.
[00:51:03.834 --> 00:51:06.376]  That haggling has gone on for decades.
[00:51:06.456 --> 00:51:07.276]  That's how it works.
[00:51:07.857 --> 00:51:16.583]  And then, in this case, even, the bank, that was supposedly defrauded, testified and said, we didn't lose anything, we want to do business with this guy again.
[00:51:17.183 --> 00:51:17.743]  We'd like to.
[00:51:17.863 --> 00:51:19.924]  But the judge said, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:51:20.324 --> 00:51:24.086]  Let's penalize this developer for $355 million.
[00:51:24.146 --> 00:51:30.549]  And if we're going to do that, let's penalize all the developers all across America.
[00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:32.350]  They've all done the same thing.
[00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:36.612]  All of them should go to jail and we should stop building buildings.
[00:51:36.932 --> 00:51:38.713]  That's what the message is from New York.
[00:51:39.133 --> 00:51:44.795]  Even the governor herself is concerned about what this looks like to investors all around the world.
[00:51:44.855 --> 00:51:45.876]  It's not just U.S.
[00:51:45.936 --> 00:51:46.396]  domestic.
[00:51:46.956 --> 00:51:49.437]  All around the world, people are talking about what happened here.
[00:51:49.898 --> 00:51:52.639]  You really think people want to invest money in New York after this?
[00:51:53.019 --> 00:51:54.480]  How about we go somewhere else?
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:52:00.063]  I think there are people who would... I don't want to cut you off, but I want to converse with you instead.
[00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:01.103]  Well, you just did.
[00:52:01.203 --> 00:52:05.565]  It's only because I want to have a conversation, Kevin, as opposed to just having you tell me.
[00:52:05.585 --> 00:52:06.946]  I respect you because you're a lawyer.
[00:52:07.566 --> 00:52:08.267]  You're a lawyer.
[00:52:08.347 --> 00:52:10.488]  You understand exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:52:11.024 --> 00:52:16.191]  I gotta tell you, I'm respectable for a number of reasons, Kevin O'Leary, but being a lawyer is one of those issues.
[00:52:16.231 --> 00:52:30.946]   But I'll tell you, when I hear your conversation, and I do want to converse with you about this point, I understand that there are legitimate concerns that were raised during the trial and will continue to be raised about Who the quote-unquote, what, who is actually bringing the suit?
[00:52:30.966 --> 00:52:58.062]   It wasn't the banks who were saying that we as consumers are unsophisticated feel this way, but Letitia James, Attorney General, and I know you want to expand beyond Trump, has suggested, well, it's about making the playing field level for those who are not the major and billionaire investors, but for those who are supposed to put business records out there, want to get a loan, the idea of making sure that they have to have the same True statements included as those who have a lot more money.
[00:52:58.162 --> 00:52:59.747]  Is there any weight to that for you?
[00:53:01.532 --> 00:53:01.712]  Well...
[00:53:02.685 --> 00:53:06.067]  I asked you who lost money, and I'll make it even clearer.
[00:53:06.547 --> 00:53:13.051]  You and I, we're developing a data center together, and I say to you, we can go to New York, where this just happened.
[00:53:13.692 --> 00:53:14.572]  It's your money now.
[00:53:15.093 --> 00:53:17.214]  You're now an investor, and you're taking risks.
[00:53:17.234 --> 00:53:19.015]  You're an entrepreneur with me, right beside me.
[00:53:19.035 --> 00:53:19.996]  We're together on the deal.
[00:53:20.436 --> 00:53:26.480]  Or I can show you Oklahoma, North Dakota, West Virginia, where the governors actually ran businesses.
[00:53:27.344 --> 00:53:29.686]  Let's go there, where this never happened before.
[00:53:30.006 --> 00:53:34.710]  They have power, they have permits, they've got legislation that's supportive of entrepreneurship.
[00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:36.331]  Why would we go to New York?
[00:53:36.451 --> 00:53:37.872]  Why take the risk?
[00:53:38.293 --> 00:53:45.398]  My only point is, did we just diminish the great state of New York and the great people of New York?
[00:53:45.818 --> 00:53:49.901]  And shouldn't they ask for better management so they don't become a flyover state?
[00:53:50.362 --> 00:53:55.842]   Remember, New York has the highest taxes in the country, the worst regulatory environment,
[00:53:55.842 --> 00:53:57.762]  and it's incredibly mismanaged.
[00:53:57.762 --> 00:54:03.842]   And I'm pointing out now on top of that, you get this insanity, a victimless crime.
[00:54:03.842 --> 00:54:05.880]  And forget about Trump, it's not about Trump.
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.521]  I don't care about Trump in this.
[00:54:07.521 --> 00:54:15.001]   I care about America, and I care about entrepreneurship, and I care about democracy and the fairness.
[00:54:15.001 --> 00:54:17.401]  The judicial system is now being criticized.
[00:54:17.401 --> 00:54:25.561]   People are asking themselves, the bar of New York, is this judge rational to charge $355 million
[00:54:25.561 --> 00:54:27.601]  in a case where no one lost any money?
[00:54:27.797 --> 00:54:29.758]  Is that good for the people of New York?
[00:54:30.058 --> 00:54:33.919]  Should the people of New York wake up to this and say, what's happening to us?
[00:54:34.399 --> 00:54:37.820]  Why is this becoming so perverse?
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:41.041]  Why are we the focus of this injustice?
[00:54:41.461 --> 00:54:42.702]  And I have nothing to do with Trump.
[00:54:42.762 --> 00:54:43.862]  I'm not supporting Trump.
[00:54:44.162 --> 00:54:46.163]  I'm supporting American entrepreneurship.
[00:54:46.623 --> 00:54:54.419]   And New York is slowly becoming the number one loser I'm sorry, that's what's happening.
[00:54:55.059 --> 00:55:07.784]  Well, that's news to the city that doesn't sleep, but I'll tell you what, the governor has said that... Welcome to hour number two, my friends, of this Tuesday, February 20th, 2024 transmission.
[00:55:09.305 --> 00:55:10.285]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:55:13.826 --> 00:55:20.949]  All right, let me put bookends on what we covered last hour, the mass awakening happening, the people realizing their power, the truckers saying they're gonna not deliver to New York.
[00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:31.716]  Congress people, media pundits attacking them, huge ex-accounts saying good riddance, making more truckers now say they're going to boycott.
[00:55:32.136 --> 00:55:34.638]  It's going to just devastate what's left of New York.
[00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:43.023]  Because the left and their minions have no respect for reality and no respect for anybody, even themselves.
[00:55:44.424 --> 00:55:46.865]  They don't think second, third, fourth order magnitude.
[00:55:47.626 --> 00:55:51.028]  That's what they mean when they say, he's playing checkers, we're playing chess.
[00:55:52.642 --> 00:55:55.063]  Chess is second and third and fourth order magnitude.
[00:55:55.363 --> 00:55:58.845]  The Masters are, you know, six, seven, eight orders of magnitude out.
[00:55:58.925 --> 00:56:00.885]  They can see no matter how you move, what's going to happen.
[00:56:01.206 --> 00:56:02.186]  That's the genius of it.
[00:56:03.166 --> 00:56:05.147]  The globalists aren't even playing checkers, folks.
[00:56:06.128 --> 00:56:07.488]  They just say, we win the game.
[00:56:07.528 --> 00:56:08.288]  We don't even play the game.
[00:56:08.328 --> 00:56:09.089]  We win the game.
[00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:10.990]  It's like you're getting ready to play pool.
[00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:12.350]  No, this is not play pool.
[00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:12.850]  I already won.
[00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:14.911]  You're like, we haven't even racked up the balls yet.
[00:56:14.951 --> 00:56:16.232]  We haven't even broke yet.
[00:56:16.252 --> 00:56:17.072]  They're like, no, I won.
[00:56:17.092 --> 00:56:19.333]  You're like, no, you didn't.
[00:56:19.993 --> 00:56:21.634]  Well, I have a chess department and they said I did.
[00:56:23.967 --> 00:56:28.367]   And so you can do that for a while, but then people are just going to withdraw their support from you.
[00:56:28.367 --> 00:56:38.047]   But if you look at how the Democrats have already destroyed their cities and how the Globalists have destroyed Europe,
[00:56:38.047 --> 00:56:48.047]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:56:40.643 --> 00:56:44.504]  They're threatened by the prosperity of Europe and the West and the idea of freedom.
[00:56:45.224 --> 00:56:50.485]  So the globals want to dominate that while they used its power to take over the world.
[00:56:51.205 --> 00:56:56.066]  But then their own command bases and where their own mansions are, are now crime-infested hellholes.
[00:56:59.206 --> 00:57:04.087]  It's like saying, even if you're going to cheat on your wife, don't shit where you eat.
[00:57:05.327 --> 00:57:07.848]  Don't have sex with women or men at your office.
[00:57:10.899 --> 00:57:12.700]  But people do that, and does it ever end well?
[00:57:12.881 --> 00:57:13.101]  No.
[00:57:15.863 --> 00:57:18.545]  And it's the same story over and over and over again.
[00:57:18.705 --> 00:57:20.287]  I use the analogy of people peeing in the pool.
[00:57:21.368 --> 00:57:22.448]  Little kids pee in the pool.
[00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:31.015]  And if you go into a public pool, it's toxic, it burns your eyes, they can put so much chlorine in it to kill all the garbage that's in there, it's horrible.
[00:57:31.376 --> 00:57:33.978]  But what happens when somebody takes a dump in the pool?
[00:57:35.438 --> 00:57:36.061]  They close it.
[00:57:36.763 --> 00:57:37.587]  They gotta drain it.
[00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:39.153]  There's E. coli.
[00:57:39.213 --> 00:57:39.876]  It's dangerous.
[00:57:40.318 --> 00:57:41.060]  You can see it.
[00:57:42.028 --> 00:57:47.952]  So the Democratic Party on the left and the Rothschilds and the New World Order have been peeing thousands of gallons of the pool for a long time.
[00:57:48.292 --> 00:57:52.034]  And the pool's green and it stinks, but folks still get in it.
[00:57:52.774 --> 00:58:00.759]  But now the CIA and the Democratic Party and these judges are pulling their pants down and the pool's just like a cesspool, like a sewage treatment plant.
[00:58:01.139 --> 00:58:05.522]  There's just thousands of you-know-what's floating in it.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:16.381]  And they got a bunch of arrogant, sociopathic criminals like Hochul and Newsom that'll sit up there and giggle and laugh, and that's all they've got is their Confidence Act.
[00:58:17.862 --> 00:58:20.422]  But there's a point where no one buys into it anymore.
[00:58:23.083 --> 00:58:25.163]  So there's this ongoing war on logic.
[00:58:28.404 --> 00:58:51.494]   And their standard tactics written up in the psychology books, I remember I talked about it decades ago, I was in a Barnes and Nobles and it was a psychology Magazine I bought the magazine I showed on there was more scholarly big thick trade publication and I was talking about some massacres was declassified in the 80s that the British had done in Kenya.
[00:58:52.534 --> 00:58:53.735]  There's a psychological name for it.
[00:58:53.755 --> 00:58:54.495]  I tried to look up this morning.
[00:58:54.515 --> 00:58:57.716]  I couldn't find it called quote effect.
[00:58:58.116 --> 00:59:07.718]   I'll think of it in a minute, but The British had killed tens of thousands of Kenyans because they uprose.
[00:59:07.778 --> 00:59:10.380]  And you notice the Kenyans did end up getting their independence.
[00:59:11.821 --> 00:59:21.887]  And the British Ministry of Defense and MI6 put out a memo saying, claim we killed nine or whatever it was, less than ten, claim we killed nine villagers.
[00:59:22.887 --> 00:59:28.606]   So when people hear 10,000, 15, I forget the exact number, it's a lot.
[00:59:28.606 --> 00:59:32.047]   British troops with tanks and troops just mowing people down.
[00:59:32.047 --> 00:59:40.086]   The brain will average that number down to the lower number because people
[00:59:40.086 --> 00:59:42.168]  think of themselves individually.
[00:59:42.168 --> 00:59:43.688]  Like, could I kill 10,000 people?
[00:59:43.688 --> 00:59:45.086]  Well, no, 'cause you think of yourself as small.
[00:59:45.086 --> 00:59:45.906]  You're little.
[00:59:45.906 --> 00:59:46.746]  You think, would I kill five people?
[00:59:46.746 --> 00:59:47.567]  Yeah.
[00:59:47.567 --> 00:59:50.648]  So, and they explain it all in the psychological memo.
[00:59:51.046 --> 00:59:52.126]  That's why they have all these headlines.
[00:59:52.146 --> 00:59:54.648]  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:59:54.908 --> 01:00:00.812]  The COVID shots are causing heart attacks and weird blood clots and strokes and myocarditis and all this.
[01:00:02.133 --> 01:00:02.854]  But it's very rare.
[01:00:07.455 --> 01:00:11.699]  So we have the insurance actuaries, all these other studies between 17 and 22 million dead worldwide.
[01:00:12.219 --> 01:00:15.623]  Government databases, depending on how you slice it, it's around 20 million dead and growing.
[01:00:16.383 --> 01:00:18.545]  Blood clots never before seen everywhere, it's all being reported.
[01:00:20.527 --> 01:00:22.769]  Well, they just come out with new headlines, oh, guess what?
[01:00:22.829 --> 01:00:28.975]  Prestigious medical institution in the US did a study and it is causing death.
[01:00:31.577 --> 01:00:33.219]  But it's very, very rare.
[01:00:36.371 --> 01:00:37.732]  Yeah, there's the New York Times a few years ago.
[01:00:37.792 --> 01:00:39.112]  Feeling terrible after your shot?
[01:00:39.232 --> 01:00:40.332]  Then it's probably working.
[01:00:44.634 --> 01:01:02.583]   So, if you get a real vaccine, I've talked to medical doctors about this, this is mainline science, there may be additives to it and there may be contaminated with other viruses or things, that's the real danger, but if you could have a pure Virus.
[01:01:02.924 --> 01:01:06.005]  There was nothing else in there and it's attenuated, radiated, or whatever they've done to it.
[01:01:06.586 --> 01:01:08.727]  And you take it, you don't even get sick.
[01:01:09.307 --> 01:01:10.448]  Your body just learns what it is.
[01:01:10.468 --> 01:01:11.168]  You don't get a fever.
[01:01:11.188 --> 01:01:11.849]  You don't feel bad.
[01:01:11.869 --> 01:01:12.909]  You don't even feel tired.
[01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:14.730]  A real vaccine does that.
[01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:15.691]  And they could make them.
[01:01:15.931 --> 01:01:16.591]  It's expensive.
[01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:17.632]  It's hard to make sure they're clean.
[01:01:19.411 --> 01:01:20.832]  They had liability protection since 1986.
[01:01:21.572 --> 01:01:22.412]  Bad thing Reagan did.
[01:01:22.432 --> 01:01:23.893]  It's the same thing worldwide.
[01:01:23.933 --> 01:01:29.294]  They have no liability, and they're just filthy full of SV40 cancer virus.
[01:01:29.315 --> 01:01:29.915]  Just look it up.
[01:01:29.955 --> 01:01:33.956]  The current COVID shot's full of SV40, a very aggressive simian virus.
[01:01:34.316 --> 01:01:35.737]  One of the main causes of cancer worldwide.
[01:01:35.757 --> 01:01:36.577]  You want to watch it exploding?
[01:01:37.557 --> 01:01:38.498]  It's just full of everything.
[01:01:39.158 --> 01:01:40.338]  That's what Judy Minkowitz pointed out.
[01:01:40.378 --> 01:01:41.759]  She used to work on this stuff for the government.
[01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:47.577]  They're trying to cover up all the other vaccine damage, thinking they're going to say it's COVID shot later.
[01:01:48.357 --> 01:01:49.238]  She said this three years ago.
[01:01:49.278 --> 01:01:49.859]  It's now come out.
[01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:50.379]  She's right.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:58.968]  It's also the Spars war game document came out years before they released COVID in 2020, or late 2019, but announced in 2020.
[01:02:01.330 --> 01:02:08.073]   And so they put everything, all the cancer viruses, all the fetal tissue, all the cancer Molecules.
[01:02:08.693 --> 01:02:14.438]  They put, that's why pharmacists would open up the data sheet that came with the shots and it would say nothing.
[01:02:14.818 --> 01:02:18.221]  They'd never seen a drug that didn't have something about just the name and who made it.
[01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:21.864]  Because they put everything into it.
[01:02:24.466 --> 01:02:26.528]  And then they'll say, oh, it's the COVID shot.
[01:02:26.908 --> 01:02:28.550]  We had special liability protection on that.
[01:02:30.111 --> 01:02:32.593]  But see such large numbers of people never took it.
[01:02:35.290 --> 01:02:38.531]  So you have a huge control group, kind of like the Amish lived on average to 85.
[01:02:38.611 --> 01:02:42.271]  Everybody else lives like 72 now.
[01:02:42.351 --> 01:02:45.452]  Yeah, the lives especially went down from 75 to 72 on average.
[01:02:45.712 --> 01:02:46.512]  The average men and women together.
[01:02:47.793 --> 01:02:49.273]  Women like 75, men like 70.
[01:02:49.373 --> 01:02:50.693]  I mean, it's bad.
[01:02:51.733 --> 01:02:55.354]  We got the Amish over living to 85 and almost no cancer, no autism.
[01:02:55.674 --> 01:02:57.254]  I mean, it's a dangerous control group.
[01:02:57.275 --> 01:02:58.095]  You go, hey, what's wrong?
[01:02:58.575 --> 01:02:59.315]  What's wrong with us?
[01:02:59.435 --> 01:03:00.155]  Why are they okay?
[01:03:00.175 --> 01:03:04.276]  That's why they're trying to shut down the Amish.
[01:03:05.572 --> 01:03:14.475]  Because when everybody's dying at age, you know, 30, and everybody's got Alzheimer's by 25, which is starting to happen, and everybody's infertile, and the Amish are over here just fine, well, you're going to say, well, what's going on with them?
[01:03:14.495 --> 01:03:18.376]  Well, it's the same thing with the control group.
[01:03:20.037 --> 01:03:21.877]  30% of people never took a shot.
[01:03:21.877 --> 01:03:30.117]  Now it's down to like less than 10% taking it.
[01:03:30.117 --> 01:03:40.117]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:32.662]  So they got a big problem on their hands.
[01:03:33.202 --> 01:03:39.506]  And now, as Tedros of the UN said, and as the Clintons said at their global initiative, no one trusts us.
[01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:40.267]  It's worse now.
[01:03:40.287 --> 01:03:41.567]  Bill Gates, everybody hates us.
[01:03:41.587 --> 01:03:42.448]  God, we got a problem.
[01:03:43.068 --> 01:03:46.270]  But Bill Gates said, don't worry, something so horrible's coming, you'll take it.
[01:03:46.571 --> 01:03:50.533]  Oh, you're not going to release a mild virus this time and have the shot be the killer.
[01:03:50.913 --> 01:03:54.996]  Oh, they're going to release something really nasty, because they never give up.
[01:03:55.496 --> 01:03:59.579]  Well, you're going to kill a lot of people, Gates, Klaus Schwab, all you guys.
[01:04:00.731 --> 01:04:06.876]  Peter Daszak, but Anthony Fauci, but it's not that I like our odds.
[01:04:07.637 --> 01:04:08.537]  I know we're going to win.
[01:04:08.718 --> 01:04:09.398]  It's a slam dunk.
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.682]  People already know you just committed this mass crime.
[01:04:14.983 --> 01:04:23.890]  You better hope some natural virus doesn't show up or leak out of one of your labs on accident because you're going to all be, let's just say, not in a very nice place.
[01:04:24.971 --> 01:04:28.554]  People are going to tear you limb from limb.
[01:04:30.512 --> 01:04:32.373]  So go ahead, be my Huckleberry.
[01:04:33.313 --> 01:04:34.153]  And I know you will.
[01:04:34.273 --> 01:04:36.554]  You can't help it, you murdering, arrogant filth.
[01:04:40.035 --> 01:04:42.775]  We're not asleep anymore, Bubba.
[01:04:47.097 --> 01:04:47.497]  Go ahead.
[01:04:49.637 --> 01:04:50.698]  What's Dirty Harry say?
[01:04:52.558 --> 01:04:53.178]  Make my day?
[01:04:53.198 --> 01:04:58.520]  Because you're staring down the barrel of an awakening giant.
[01:05:02.059 --> 01:05:04.700]  But you've had so much power so long, you have a normalcy bias.
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:06.781]  You're gonna roll those dice again.
[01:05:06.801 --> 01:05:11.362]  If they were smart, they'd back up and wait a while.
[01:05:11.402 --> 01:05:13.683]  People forgot about this a few decades, but you won't.
[01:05:14.143 --> 01:05:14.744]  You can't help it.
[01:05:17.885 --> 01:05:23.187]  So... Everybody has to get ready for the next attack.
[01:05:23.487 --> 01:05:25.908]  Now, let's shift gears into another big story of scientific...
[01:05:27.253 --> 01:05:31.917]  Quackery and it's just unintentional comedy, the likes of which make my head spin.
[01:05:31.937 --> 01:05:32.857]  Let's put it up on screen here.
[01:05:33.598 --> 01:05:37.961]  Men and women brains do work differently, scientists discover for first time.
[01:05:39.022 --> 01:05:46.888]  Headline ought to say, scientists discover for the first time that if you stick your hand in a garbage disposal when it's on, it's going to cut off the ends of your fingers.
[01:05:50.111 --> 01:05:56.716]  Or maybe you should say, scientists discover the first time that if you jump out in front of a train going 100 miles an hour, you're going to die.
[01:05:57.777 --> 01:06:05.700]  Or maybe, scientists discovered the first time, if you pour five gallons of gasoline on yourself and light yourself on fire, you're gonna burn yourself to death.
[01:06:08.921 --> 01:06:13.102]  I mean, it is, it is, it is so ridiculous, but why do they do this?
[01:06:13.162 --> 01:06:14.383]  To scramble your brain.
[01:06:15.345 --> 01:06:16.585]  Men and women aren't different.
[01:06:18.386 --> 01:06:19.826]  Men can have babies.
[01:06:20.646 --> 01:06:23.347]  Two women had a baby in the federal prison.
[01:06:25.727 --> 01:06:27.567]  Breastfeeding men are as good as mothers.
[01:06:29.868 --> 01:06:30.608]  And then they double back.
[01:06:32.028 --> 01:06:36.209]  Researchers found men and women are different.
[01:06:36.389 --> 01:06:48.595]   They want you to have all thoughts in your head at all times in a confusing Discombobulated world, where sometimes there's X and Y chromosomes, but sometimes they're not.
[01:06:49.156 --> 01:07:14.364]   When, when O'Brien, the torturer, and the inner party is torturing the outer party member, Winston Smith, in the dystopic nightmare novel, 1984, he's been torturing Winston for a month, pulling his teeth out, electro-shocking him, everything, he says, When I hold up four fingers, I don't want you just to agree there's four.
[01:07:15.304 --> 01:07:16.784]  If I say it's five, you say it's five.
[01:07:17.284 --> 01:07:19.124]  It's not that I want you to just do what I say.
[01:07:19.304 --> 01:07:22.565]  I want you to believe it's whatever I say.
[01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:26.926]  And finally, Winston sees dozens of fingers and says, I don't know how many fingers.
[01:07:26.946 --> 01:07:27.746]  He goes, good.
[01:07:29.306 --> 01:07:30.446]  Now I've tortured you.
[01:07:30.466 --> 01:07:31.787]  You're now a mind control slave.
[01:07:35.007 --> 01:07:39.268]  And we're going to put you out to pasture for a few months.
[01:07:41.587 --> 01:07:44.089]  And watch you closely and make sure that we took your soul.
[01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:45.951]  We like to hurt free will.
[01:07:45.991 --> 01:07:47.432]  We like to dominate God's spirit.
[01:07:48.093 --> 01:07:49.294]  The little piece in you.
[01:07:49.314 --> 01:07:57.481]  And he said, then we're going to kill you and we're going to burn you in an incinerator and shoot your ashes in the atmosphere and no one will ever know you existed.
[01:07:58.122 --> 01:08:00.441]  And Winston says, "Thank you, that sounds great."
[01:08:00.441 --> 01:08:07.481]  And he says, "You know why we do this, Winston?"
[01:08:07.421 --> 01:08:08.841]  He said, no.
[01:08:08.861 --> 01:08:10.922]  He goes, because we're the priest of power.
[01:08:11.582 --> 01:08:14.563]  We want people to live less and be totally alone.
[01:08:15.384 --> 01:08:18.085]  And we want to press on the nerve of power and trample to be trampled upon.
[01:08:18.125 --> 01:08:20.726]  He goes, Winston, I'll be arrested soon and tortured to death.
[01:08:20.846 --> 01:08:21.266]  I love it.
[01:08:22.046 --> 01:08:23.127]  I want to hurt humanity.
[01:08:23.267 --> 01:08:24.307]  I love Satan.
[01:08:26.948 --> 01:08:30.649]  And we're always showing this 1940s TV or 1950s TV version.
[01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:34.891]  Pull up the color one with the famous British actor, William Hurt.
[01:08:37.799 --> 01:08:41.920]  And it's also got the other guy in it.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:43.620]  Kevin William Hurt, 1984.
[01:08:45.241 --> 01:08:46.161]  That's a better B-roll.
[01:08:49.682 --> 01:08:56.663]  So, let's just talk about the difference between men and women, and it's way more amazing than this.
[01:08:58.303 --> 01:09:10.757]   It's amazing because men have their attributes and their gifts God gave us, and then women have their attributes and their gifts, and their They're amazing, and this is not some leftist, kissing women's ass thing.
[01:09:11.357 --> 01:09:12.217]  I mean, it really is true.
[01:09:12.237 --> 01:09:19.059]  If I had to sit down, I think you would agree, most of you, and if you said, who is more amazing?
[01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:26.560]  And men do incredible things, and men can do math better, and fight better, and focus, and have fun, and men are wonderful.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:33.682]  But if I had to sit back and really say, who is more magical?
[01:09:33.782 --> 01:09:34.262]  Men or women?
[01:09:34.322 --> 01:09:35.062]  It's obviously women.
[01:09:36.627 --> 01:09:38.848]  I mean, they're a one-person operation.
[01:09:38.868 --> 01:09:39.729]  They've got milk.
[01:09:40.129 --> 01:09:41.149]  They grow the baby.
[01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:42.070]  They love the baby.
[01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:44.771]  They're just incredible.
[01:09:45.252 --> 01:09:46.552]  And they do so much more than that.
[01:09:46.813 --> 01:09:48.813]  and they nurture and they build.
[01:09:48.813 --> 01:09:57.132]  And we're one species, but we're separate and equal.
[01:09:57.298 --> 01:09:59.039]  We're different, but equal in different ways.
[01:09:59.279 --> 01:10:00.340]  We have so much potential.
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:04.382]  So let me just tell you what's mainline medical literature and is established and is not debated by anybody.
[01:10:05.856 --> 01:10:10.320]  A female baby or fetus is twice as tough on average as a male fetus.
[01:10:11.861 --> 01:10:16.125]  They can handle disease, wounds, gunshot wounds, broken bones.
[01:10:16.165 --> 01:10:17.226]  They heal faster, they do better.
[01:10:17.726 --> 01:10:25.773]  Because males are high geared for going out hunting, fishing, building, fighting.
[01:10:27.535 --> 01:10:28.796]  We're focused on mission.
[01:10:30.091 --> 01:10:38.016]  Women are back at the hearth in the center of the tribe, just like in a beehive or an ant hive, the females at the center.
[01:10:39.016 --> 01:10:39.917]  It's in nature everywhere.
[01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:52.724]  And then they somehow convince you, with all the movies and the culture, no, no, no, women are the best fighters, and women are the best repetitions, and the women are the best at chess, and women are the best... No, you're not!
[01:10:54.986 --> 01:11:02.669]  Because your brain has three times the connections on average between left and right hemisphere, your mind is one.
[01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:06.930]  So you have better intuition.
[01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:09.111]  Remember what Donald Trump said?
[01:11:09.131 --> 01:11:12.052]  He said the deepest thing he ever learned was how to be shallow.
[01:11:12.672 --> 01:11:20.875]  Because he has all those ancestors, all those instincts, all that knowledge, all that personal knowledge, and your first instinct is always right.
[01:11:24.312 --> 01:11:26.312]  The deepest thing I ever did was to learn to be shallow.
[01:11:26.811 --> 01:11:28.811]  What a deep statement.
[01:11:28.811 --> 01:11:40.311]   And so, women's bones on average are twice as strong as ours.
[01:11:41.055 --> 01:11:41.655]  Half as strong.
[01:11:41.715 --> 01:11:42.555]  Ours are twice as strong.
[01:11:43.355 --> 01:11:45.376]  Women don't have the big blood volume.
[01:11:45.576 --> 01:11:47.596]  Women don't have the thick skull.
[01:11:48.256 --> 01:12:00.216]   Women aren't designed, like in an anthill, The warriors that are twice the size of the other ants, three times in some cases, like the famous Texas Red Ant.
[01:12:00.276 --> 01:12:03.958]  Beautiful ants, love to watch them.
[01:12:04.118 --> 01:12:07.519]  One ant can like carry a rock, weighs five times its weight, ten times, it's incredible.
[01:12:07.759 --> 01:12:11.261]  This pebble, this little ant's carrying it.
[01:12:11.361 --> 01:12:18.284]  And those males are totally focused and geared to defend their ant hill.
[01:12:21.806 --> 01:12:22.246]  Their hive.
[01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:26.811]  And again, that's in that species.
[01:12:27.991 --> 01:12:28.871]  It's all around you.
[01:12:28.891 --> 01:12:32.793]  You don't have scientists going to an anthill and saying, oh, those male ants can have babies.
[01:12:35.954 --> 01:12:41.456]  Or, oh, those male ants are equal to the female ants.
[01:12:41.776 --> 01:12:42.517]  It's ants.
[01:12:42.677 --> 01:12:43.657]  It's what they are.
[01:12:43.977 --> 01:12:48.619]  They're one organism broken into individuals, a collective.
[01:12:48.879 --> 01:12:53.201]  And the left always tells you you're a collective from the top down.
[01:12:56.755 --> 01:12:57.736]  That's not how collectives work.
[01:12:58.156 --> 01:13:02.520]  It's a collective that it all works together but it's all individual action carrying it out.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.321]  They operate off pheromones and other things.
[01:13:04.762 --> 01:13:07.023]  We're way more advanced than a hive colony.
[01:13:07.104 --> 01:13:08.665]  A jellyfish is not one creature.
[01:13:09.425 --> 01:13:17.993]  A jellyfish is a whole consortium of cells that have a template that organizes them into the jellyfish.
[01:13:18.473 --> 01:13:21.515]  Whether it's a hundred feet long or an inch long.
[01:13:23.957 --> 01:13:35.657]   So the reason I hit this is Why are they coming out and telling you, scientists discovered for the first time birds, some bird species can fly.
[01:13:36.558 --> 01:13:37.260]  You'd laugh at that.
[01:13:39.215 --> 01:13:44.036]  But they've already pushed the agenda that there is no difference, there are no Xs and Ys, so now they're back.
[01:13:44.156 --> 01:13:54.359]  Oh, but I knew, before the article this morning, I got up and I saw it at 5 a.m., and I went, the article will be a brain scan saying women are actually better for society because they work collectively together.
[01:13:54.879 --> 01:13:56.300]  And sure as hell, that's what it said.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:00.181]  It was like, oh, women are good communists, they're gonna work better.
[01:14:00.201 --> 01:14:07.683]  That's why BlackRock and all of them are putting women in charge, because women have an instinct to work collectively when the tribe is good and healthy.
[01:14:09.346 --> 01:14:15.787]  But not when women are put in the positions of power to then destroy the collective.
[01:14:17.768 --> 01:14:28.990]  So, before I read it, I said, when I read the study, it'll all be about the battle between men and women, and who has a better brain, and now we're gonna be told women have better brains.
[01:14:31.971 --> 01:14:48.702]   And sure as hell, I read the articles, and then I read the study, scanned over it, and it's exactly what I knew it would, because it's all the same agenda over and over and over again, and it's pure BS.
[01:14:51.783 --> 01:14:52.444]  Here's the study.
[01:14:52.724 --> 01:14:54.704]  The battle of the brains.
[01:14:54.964 --> 01:14:59.486]  Oh, it's not men and women together forming the species, working together.
[01:14:59.546 --> 01:15:01.647]  No, it's men fighting women.
[01:15:01.527 --> 01:15:13.445]   who's better? And they say if you were more like women you'd live longer.
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.062]  Women are designed to live longer.
[01:15:17.524 --> 01:15:19.446]  Men are designed to be expendable.
[01:15:21.027 --> 01:15:26.531]  Stanford Medical Study identifies distinct brain organization patterns in women and men.
[01:15:26.691 --> 01:15:27.732]  Oh my gosh!
[01:15:28.492 --> 01:15:30.294]  The battle of the brain, men versus women.
[01:15:31.647 --> 01:15:33.347]  It's always versus.
[01:15:34.168 --> 01:15:35.988]  Oh, BlackRock cares about you women.
[01:15:36.388 --> 01:15:43.389]  I mean, you can't watch any show on Netflix where the women aren't all the bosses and aren't all the warriors and aren't all the scientists and the men are idiots.
[01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:51.031]  I mean, obviously women, you have sons, you have daughters, anyone that has had children knows you're one group together on the same team.
[01:15:51.271 --> 01:15:52.171]  If you're not, you're in trouble.
[01:15:52.731 --> 01:15:53.712]  What is this idea?
[01:15:54.012 --> 01:15:55.532]  It's pure crap.
[01:15:57.792 --> 01:15:58.873]  And again, I'll give you another example.
[01:15:58.993 --> 01:16:04.662]   Women, as I mentioned earlier, Have, on average, twice the blood-brain barrier.
[01:16:04.822 --> 01:16:15.255]  So the sac around the brain and the way the blood vessels come in is twice as thick to protect that brain.
[01:16:16.684 --> 01:16:18.965]  That's why women aren't as autistic.
[01:16:19.565 --> 01:16:20.346]  90 plus percent are male.
[01:16:20.666 --> 01:16:28.629]  Because the brain of a woman is designed where she gives up bone mass and aggression and fast twitch muscles and all that.
[01:16:29.229 --> 01:16:34.932]  Her entire system, on average, talk, look it up for yourself, talk to any trauma doctor.
[01:16:36.933 --> 01:16:40.694]  They see a young man come in with gunshot wounds across the chest, they go, we're gonna probably lose him.
[01:16:41.554 --> 01:16:44.676]  They see a female come in, they go, we got a chance.
[01:16:45.731 --> 01:16:53.227]  Because everybody knows women are tougher when it comes to surviving, which you're designed like a seed to survive.
[01:16:53.929 --> 01:16:55.873]  The men are designed to protect the seed.
[01:16:57.082 --> 01:17:03.724]  So all of this obsessing on women and the system wants to empower you is about destroying us, destroying you.
[01:17:04.385 --> 01:17:09.207]  We are one, but we are separate for our defense and our adaptability.
[01:17:09.987 --> 01:17:18.070]  And it is the men that go out and compete in the genetic system to advance the genetics and the women that choose the genetics to advance us into the future.
[01:17:18.810 --> 01:17:19.890]  It's God's plan.
[01:17:20.231 --> 01:17:20.811]  We'll be back.
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:31.005]  Unless you've been living under a rock, you've heard how amazing turmeric is for inflammation for your joints, your bones, your blood, your organs, your mind, everything.
[01:17:31.445 --> 01:17:36.188]  Well, we have Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% curcuminoid extract.
[01:17:36.608 --> 01:17:39.090]  No one that we know of has it even above 85%.
[01:17:39.130 --> 01:17:47.795]  This is the strongest formula on the market and it's way lower priced than some of the top brands out there that are 75%, 80% humanoid.
[01:17:48.235 --> 01:17:51.037]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing.
[01:17:51.297 --> 01:17:52.538]  You're missing out if you don't try it.

[01:18:21.259 --> 01:18:28.859]   In New York City and New York State, in Michigan, in Detroit, in California,
[01:18:28.859 --> 01:18:30.859]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:18:30.704 --> 01:18:34.267]  Every Democrat-controlled state is now telling people on the news.
[01:18:34.968 --> 01:18:36.529]  I see dozens of the newscasts today.
[01:18:36.549 --> 01:18:37.430]  I see the postings.
[01:18:37.450 --> 01:18:38.271]  I've only watched a few of them.
[01:18:38.751 --> 01:18:39.872]  But it's always the same formula.
[01:18:39.992 --> 01:18:43.415]  Oh, they're loving white people that don't want to be racist.
[01:18:44.836 --> 01:18:47.238]  They actually say they don't want to be evil white people.
[01:18:47.698 --> 01:18:49.399]  They've brought in brown people.
[01:18:50.433 --> 01:18:51.213]  The good is their heart.
[01:18:51.253 --> 01:18:53.454]  They're being paid money by the federal government.
[01:18:53.894 --> 01:18:55.094]  It's the New Democrat business.
[01:18:55.855 --> 01:18:57.155]  You put illegal aliens in your house.
[01:18:58.095 --> 01:19:03.677]  You sign them up for welfare, you skim part of it, and you put them in a job and skim the money off of them.
[01:19:04.237 --> 01:19:08.238]  Just like the left farms and controls the homeless and skims up to half their money.
[01:19:09.619 --> 01:19:16.981]  So, they don't grow corn, they don't grow wheat, they don't grow pumpkins, they don't grow tomatoes, they don't grow potatoes, they don't grow jalapenos.
[01:19:20.287 --> 01:19:25.110]  And so you see the giant illegal alien centers everywhere with riots in Texas and riots in New York the last few days.
[01:19:27.932 --> 01:19:35.598]  And attacking the police because they can't get enough homes quick enough to get them into, because it's 30, 40, 50,000 a day coming in.
[01:19:35.778 --> 01:19:37.079]  Yeah, it's a day, folks.
[01:19:40.021 --> 01:19:42.883]  At one checkpoint, they got 14,000 in one day last month.
[01:19:46.326 --> 01:19:48.047]  So, we're going to be getting into that.
[01:19:49.495 --> 01:19:52.498]  Just finishing up on women being different than men.
[01:19:52.518 --> 01:19:59.423]  Remember last week I showed you the Dubai International World Champion SWAT Team competition?
[01:19:59.984 --> 01:20:04.027]  And I mean, you look at the guys from Latin America, Asia, Europe, the U.S.
[01:20:04.127 --> 01:20:06.249]  I mean, it's just, they're athletes.
[01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:09.712]  And 99% of men couldn't compete with them.
[01:20:10.312 --> 01:20:12.574]  And then here come the women, they didn't even check the course.
[01:20:13.055 --> 01:20:14.596]  They didn't even look into how you're supposed to do it.
[01:20:14.636 --> 01:20:15.196]  They later admit it.
[01:20:15.497 --> 01:20:18.079]  They just can't even get on a zipline.
[01:20:20.003 --> 01:20:20.703]  And go across.
[01:20:20.904 --> 01:20:36.213]  No research, no caring, no nothing with their weapons, but they're women and they've watched a lot of Netflix shows and the women are kicking all the guys' asses in the Barbarian movies and in the science fiction movies and in the war movies.
[01:20:38.194 --> 01:20:44.198]  And then meanwhile the women can't even go across the zip line.
[01:20:46.259 --> 01:20:49.601]  And it goes on, I'm not gonna, I mean they couldn't even get to the first course.
[01:20:52.638 --> 01:20:55.160]  And most, by the way, the pool's two feet deep.
[01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:57.241]  They have trouble getting out of the pool.
[01:21:00.203 --> 01:21:02.824]  So, now imagine a man trying to have a baby.
[01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:04.966]  He couldn't even, you know, begin.
[01:21:06.627 --> 01:21:08.608]  But that's, that's the idiocy we're being taught.
[01:21:08.628 --> 01:21:09.489]  That's what we're being pushed.
[01:21:09.529 --> 01:21:11.170]  So, I'm done talking about that.
[01:21:11.210 --> 01:21:16.273]  It's a pretty big deal that they would insult everybody's intelligence for the top news story in the country today.
[01:21:16.293 --> 01:21:16.813]  It's everywhere.
[01:21:17.454 --> 01:21:19.095]  Did you know what they just discovered?
[01:21:19.515 --> 01:21:20.375]  What did they discover?
[01:21:21.969 --> 01:21:27.031]  They discovered that women and men's brains are different.
[01:21:27.051 --> 01:21:27.871]  Did you know that?
[01:21:31.593 --> 01:21:32.974]  Man, that's just hard to believe.
[01:21:33.214 --> 01:21:34.574]  I had no idea that was the case.
[01:21:36.015 --> 01:21:36.355]  All right.
[01:21:38.116 --> 01:21:43.078]  I want to hit Hillary Clinton and what she's up to because it's a real window into what the enemy's planning.
[01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:45.013]  I want to hit the illegal alien stuff.
[01:21:45.053 --> 01:21:46.194]  I want to get into a bunch of the news.
[01:21:46.915 --> 01:21:49.577]  As well, we've got a guest coming up on Assigns, the first season of the press.
[01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:55.143]  So much, I've only covered like 20% of the news, so we've already covered a lot of really interesting, informative stuff.
[01:21:56.272 --> 01:22:01.016]  So interesting that I skipped both network breaks last hour and did not plug.
[01:22:01.656 --> 01:22:03.618]  And if we don't plug, I won't be here.
[01:22:03.798 --> 01:22:06.000]  Folks, we've got incredible products you need.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:07.581]  They're game-changing.
[01:22:07.701 --> 01:22:10.403]  I've got great products because I treat you like I want to be treated.
[01:22:10.984 --> 01:22:14.147]  Plus, that's just how I always operated as I got older and smarter.
[01:22:14.167 --> 01:22:21.893]  I went, wow, that's a good business system to sell people supplements that really work well because then almost everybody that orders the products reorders it.
[01:22:24.104 --> 01:22:25.345]  But that's not how the globalists operate.
[01:22:25.365 --> 01:22:26.746]  They'll put out some drug that kills you.
[01:22:27.887 --> 01:22:30.309]  And then run a bunch of advertising for it and just switch to another drug.
[01:22:31.610 --> 01:22:33.131]  Well, we got a lot of great products right now.
[01:22:33.191 --> 01:22:35.053]  Big sales, been sold out for almost six months.
[01:22:35.633 --> 01:22:38.235]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula, 95% of cuminoid.
[01:22:38.916 --> 01:22:40.777]  Average turmeric pills are 5-4%, 4-5%, and they still work.
[01:22:43.871 --> 01:22:45.312]  I don't know why they don't go concentrated.
[01:22:45.332 --> 01:22:47.612]  I don't know why they don't give them something that works 50 times better.
[01:22:47.632 --> 01:22:50.473]  I mean, literally, it's crazy.
[01:22:51.314 --> 01:22:52.614]  I mean, I just said 50 off the top of my head.
[01:22:53.034 --> 01:22:57.256]  If something's 5% versus 95%, that's almost 50 times stronger.
[01:22:57.276 --> 01:23:03.838]  27 times, I mean, the point is, it's a lot stronger, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:04.898 --> 01:23:12.681]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is available for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com right now and everybody.
[01:23:14.383 --> 01:23:15.025]  Should be tagging it.
[01:23:15.165 --> 01:23:16.889]  And everybody should be supporting the broadcast.
[01:23:17.009 --> 01:23:21.158]  We're doing really important work here and we don't get globalist funding.
[01:23:21.178 --> 01:23:22.301]  We're funding people like you, so...
[01:23:23.612 --> 01:23:24.573]  This is your broadcast.
[01:23:24.653 --> 01:23:25.493]  It belongs to you.
[01:23:25.673 --> 01:23:26.914]  The ball's in your court.
[01:23:27.034 --> 01:23:28.035]  You've got all the cards.
[01:23:28.215 --> 01:23:28.975]  I'm in your hands.
[01:23:29.916 --> 01:23:31.137]  We've got great t-shirts.
[01:23:31.177 --> 01:23:33.818]  Team Humanity t-shirt with the nuclear family on it.
[01:23:33.878 --> 01:23:34.839]  Infowars.com, 1776.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:42.383]  We've got the new Gadsden flag combined with red, white, and blue design I did that I think is a great shirt.
[01:23:42.844 --> 01:23:44.325]  Those are at Infowars.com.
[01:23:45.425 --> 01:23:47.126]  We also have Nitric Boost.
[01:23:47.927 --> 01:23:54.890]   Now 40% off because we found out that Who was manufacturing it for our manufacturer and went there and got a discount.
[01:23:55.210 --> 01:24:00.131]  So instead of 25% off, I'm offering a sale of 40% off, passing the savings on to you.
[01:24:00.471 --> 01:24:01.692]  Cleans out your blood, your whole body.

[01:24:06.453 --> 01:24:07.533]  It's about to sell out.
[01:24:08.373 --> 01:24:19.056]  Next level foundational energy that has the breakdown of methylfolate, that is the breakdown of folic acid, that is the engine of your cells.
[01:24:19.437 --> 01:24:23.327]   So it doesn't have a stimulant effect like Adderall or caffeine does.
[01:24:23.667 --> 01:24:25.288]  That just stimulates the neurons.
[01:24:26.648 --> 01:24:31.210]  This just cleans out the cells and gives them more energy, and it's another level of energy.
[01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:33.952]  When I forget to take it, I really feel it.
[01:24:35.312 --> 01:24:36.113]  So I know you're going to love it.
[01:24:36.593 --> 01:24:37.653]  Next Level Foundational Energy.
[01:24:37.733 --> 01:24:40.355]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:24:41.675 --> 01:24:42.856]  Also, it's been sold out for a while.
[01:24:42.916 --> 01:24:43.996]  It's back in stock, discounted.
[01:24:44.577 --> 01:24:46.978]  And this is a stimulant with a bunch of amino acids and key compounds.
[01:24:47.864 --> 01:24:50.345]  Memory and focus, super powerful nootropic.
[01:24:50.805 --> 01:24:57.289]  TurboForce is time release, so it hits you in 30 minutes but lasts up to 10 hours without the letdown.
[01:24:57.649 --> 01:25:04.232]  TurboForce, infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:25:06.672 --> 01:25:13.752]   And finally, there are 14 different products available at drjonesnaturals.com
[01:25:13.752 --> 01:25:20.992]   that are not available at infowarestore.com, like the entire silver line,
[01:25:20.992 --> 01:25:23.972]  the wound gel, patented, incredible.
[01:25:23.972 --> 01:25:26.032]   I don't believe what it does for your wounds, how fast they heal.
[01:25:26.032 --> 01:25:29.132]  They got the same little silver we sell.
[01:25:29.132 --> 01:25:31.152]  It's my dad's company.
[01:25:31.152 --> 01:25:34.211]  We sell it at InfoWare Store, but we have silver bullet.
[01:25:34.211 --> 01:25:38.832]   30 parts per million, high quality, pull a little silver for topical or ingestion.
[01:25:38.832 --> 01:25:42.592]   And of course, the best seller, not available for years, now available again,
[01:25:42.592 --> 01:25:48.992]   Nano Silver Super Blue Non-Fluoride Toothpaste with iodine and tea tree oil
[01:25:48.992 --> 01:25:51.632]  and other natural essential oils.
[01:25:51.824 --> 01:25:53.084]  This is concentrate.
[01:25:53.104 --> 01:25:54.045]  There's no filler in this.
[01:25:54.985 --> 01:25:56.546]  A tiny dot works.
[01:25:56.626 --> 01:25:59.807]  It lasts two or three times longer than the regular toothpaste.
[01:25:59.827 --> 01:26:00.707]  There's no fluoride in it.
[01:26:01.804 --> 01:26:08.570]  And there's a bunch of other, we have the turmeric toothpaste, and we have the whitening toothpaste, we have the activated charcoal toothpaste, they're all great as well.
[01:26:09.091 --> 01:26:12.354]  But this is the Super Blue with the silver and the iodine.
[01:26:13.895 --> 01:26:17.018]  At DrJonesNaturals.com.
[01:26:18.059 --> 01:26:20.041]  DrJonesNaturals.com.
[01:26:20.421 --> 01:26:25.386]  And my dad did a limited run bringing it back, it's almost sold out, get it at DrJonesNaturals.com.
[01:26:25.426 --> 01:26:38.709]   And while you're there, There's all those products like Cabochill and Primal Energy and Rocket Rest and PMS Guard and just all these other top flight formulas.
[01:26:39.930 --> 01:26:46.415]  I hired a multi-degreed chemist who produces stuff for Whole Foods.
[01:26:47.261 --> 01:26:49.462]  And of course, I can't say his name or they'll fire him.
[01:26:49.482 --> 01:26:50.803]  I mean, he's allowed to do separate work.
[01:26:50.843 --> 01:26:51.524]  He's a contractor.
[01:26:51.544 --> 01:26:59.469]  But some of the top stuff in the country, he owns his own organic farm and his own organic line of super high-end supplements.
[01:27:00.170 --> 01:27:02.651]  He designed the stuff for my dad because he's friends with my dad.
[01:27:02.691 --> 01:27:03.332]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:27:05.362 --> 01:27:11.850]  So people go, my God, these products, Dr. Jones Naturals, are almost better than the ones that... It's apples and oranges, but I mean, they're as good as it gets, okay?
[01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:17.596]  DrJonesNaturals.com for all the products on available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:27:18.117 --> 01:27:19.158]  And it's good people.
[01:27:19.198 --> 01:27:19.659]  It's my dad.
[01:27:20.099 --> 01:27:22.021]  He's a big sponsor, so we really appreciate him.
[01:27:22.041 --> 01:27:23.243]  It's a win-win for everybody.
[01:27:23.623 --> 01:27:24.544]  All right, I'm gonna go to break.
[01:27:25.509 --> 01:27:26.169]  I'm going to come back.
[01:27:27.290 --> 01:27:31.633]  I'm going to hit the Hillary thing first, because that's something nobody else is really understanding.
[01:27:32.153 --> 01:27:37.416]  Everybody gets the illegal alien invasion and the lawlessness of the American society, but there's also big developments there, so we're going to hit that.
[01:27:38.077 --> 01:27:47.443]  And then we've got big military development in the Middle East, in Israel, Palestine, and in the Ukraine war that now officially admits a rout of the Ukrainians.
[01:27:48.143 --> 01:27:49.424]  So what's going to come next?
[01:27:49.504 --> 01:27:51.465]  We're at a critical juncture, inflection point on that.
[01:27:51.865 --> 01:27:53.927]  It's all coming up on this live Tuesday edition.
[01:27:53.947 --> 01:27:54.427]  Please stay with us.
[01:27:55.529 --> 01:27:56.692]  You found it, my friends.
[01:27:58.856 --> 01:28:02.384]  Recognized by the globalists as the tip of the spear.
[01:28:03.967 --> 01:28:05.150]  We carry the spirit.
[01:28:09.332 --> 01:28:13.713]  That wishes to bring humanity to the next level and transcend our fallen nature.
[01:28:14.393 --> 01:28:15.874]  We believe in humanity.
[01:28:16.554 --> 01:28:17.954]  We are human supremacists.
[01:28:18.575 --> 01:28:19.655]  We believe in discovery.
[01:28:19.995 --> 01:28:20.975]  We believe in competition.
[01:28:21.275 --> 01:28:22.156]  We believe in freedom.
[01:28:22.196 --> 01:28:34.339]  And we know that God created us to experience His complete and total mastery of all that ever was and ever has been or ever will be.
[01:28:38.976 --> 01:28:40.136]  We worship God.
[01:28:41.697 --> 01:28:48.578]  We are sanctified, purified, eternal, connected to the source, transcendent.
[01:28:49.959 --> 01:28:52.319]  And we reject Satan and all his minions.
[01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:54.980]  And we are ready to be challenged.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:56.620]  We are ready to be attacked.
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:58.361]  We are ready to be persecuted.
[01:28:58.701 --> 01:29:03.702]  We are ready to go in, through, and beyond and meet our ultimate destiny.
[01:29:06.903 --> 01:29:21.614]  Alright, so the globalist demon Hillary Clinton, Madam President, has Newsweek printed up hundreds of thousands of copies in the days before she lost in that first election against Trump in 2016.
[01:29:24.952 --> 01:29:29.816]  She's crawled out into Iraq with Christina Amanpour, who's one of the worst New World Order people out there.
[01:29:30.457 --> 01:29:47.172]  She's the one that went and found fake concentration camps in Serbia, so that the West could bomb Serbia and their capital with depleted uranium bombs and turn the country half of it over, or the lower third of it over to the Muslims, Kosovo.
[01:29:49.085 --> 01:29:57.309]  She went and famously showed one guy who had tuberculosis with his shirt off trying to get into a UN food pantry that had a barbed wire around it.
[01:29:59.470 --> 01:30:01.911]  And said, look, these people are in a concentration camp.
[01:30:03.172 --> 01:30:06.114]  That's the type of scum we got with Christina Amanpour.
[01:30:08.635 --> 01:30:16.699]  And so if you look at all the preparation, oh, there's white supremacists everywhere, oh, there's going to be a civil war, all the movies and TV shows produced by Obama and others.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:19.200]  Leaving the world forever?
[01:30:20.481 --> 01:30:25.663]  They're branding Americans not wanting to be under globalist control and being wrecked as a civil war.
[01:30:25.703 --> 01:30:30.744]  It's not a war inside our country, citizen against citizen.
[01:30:30.824 --> 01:30:34.586]  It's citizens peacefully trying to get back control of their hijacked government.
[01:30:36.506 --> 01:30:47.570]  And so they put out the talking points in 2000, in case they were unable to steal the election, that if Trump wins, we're just not going to accept it.
[01:30:49.059 --> 01:30:50.661]  Democratic Party did public war games.
[01:30:51.161 --> 01:30:52.503]  John Podesta said we won't accept it.
[01:30:52.523 --> 01:31:00.892]  We're going to have an alternate inauguration in Denver, Colorado or Colorado Springs where the alternate COG government is set up, Continental Government.
[01:31:02.093 --> 01:31:04.856]  And we're just going to disregard Trump and say that he's not the president.
[01:31:05.517 --> 01:31:07.439]  And then there's going to be civil unrest and we'll remove it.
[01:31:09.090 --> 01:31:22.958]  But they didn't have to go with plan B. They were able to steal it with all the dead people voting in the databases that Zuckerberg spent $450 million on of all the dead people and people that have moved out of state or out of county to then be able to fill out the balance and give it to people to then go cash them.
[01:31:24.219 --> 01:31:25.660]  And the drop boxes and the mail-ins.
[01:31:27.501 --> 01:31:33.405]  And so they know that's not going well for them because they were barely able to steal it and it was super obvious.
[01:31:34.187 --> 01:31:41.730]  And if Trump has an even bigger landslide, there's not enough dead people in Zuckerberg's $450 million database that can do it.
[01:31:42.571 --> 01:31:45.952]  And electronic machines they can steal in key places, but that's being watched now too.
[01:31:46.813 --> 01:31:52.776]  So they're now hedging their bet massively, knowing that Trump's really 30 points ahead of them in real polls, 15 in the others.
[01:31:52.796 --> 01:31:55.897]  10 points in battleground states.
[01:31:56.157 --> 01:31:57.358]  They're in total panic mode.
[01:31:58.098 --> 01:32:22.751]   And so they're now moving to, okay, when he gets in, if he gets in, There's going to be uprisings against it, and if he calls out the military and declares the Insurrection Act, that George Herbert Walker Bush did in the early 1990s, the LA riots, we're going to call that racist and dictatorship and brand that when we cause a racial uprising, or brand a limited uprising as racial.
[01:32:22.771 --> 01:32:25.052]  It'll really be a communist, Latinist uprising.
[01:32:26.512 --> 01:32:28.093]  And then we're going to remove Trump that way.
[01:32:29.130 --> 01:32:30.731]  And then they're pre-programming.
[01:32:30.771 --> 01:32:31.871]  You've seen the last few months.
[01:32:31.911 --> 01:32:33.472]  I told you it was coming everywhere.
[01:32:33.532 --> 01:32:37.313]  New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times, CNN, ABC News, NBC News, everywhere.
[01:32:37.693 --> 01:32:38.834]  CBS News, PBS.
[01:32:39.294 --> 01:32:42.155]  Trump's going to call out the military, and if he does, that's martial law.
[01:32:43.416 --> 01:32:51.159]  No, martial law is when a president dissolves the Parliament or the Congress and the governorships.
[01:32:51.199 --> 01:32:52.679]  That's one form, not the most common.
[01:32:53.159 --> 01:32:54.140]  President or Prime Minister.
[01:32:55.370 --> 01:33:00.831]  The most common is when another outside group gets control of the military and overthrows the existing government.
[01:33:01.552 --> 01:33:04.132]  Nine times out of ten, that's how coup d'etats operate.
[01:33:05.833 --> 01:33:07.233]  Alright, like even in the movie, Hop.
[01:33:07.413 --> 01:33:08.314]  Great children's movie.
[01:33:08.694 --> 01:33:11.754]  Don't know any stock in it, just saying it's a really funny, wholesome movie.
[01:33:11.794 --> 01:33:12.975]  Not many of those around these days.
[01:33:13.515 --> 01:33:14.895]  This has already been out ten years.
[01:33:15.555 --> 01:33:16.416]  We watch it every Easter.
[01:33:16.436 --> 01:33:18.056]  My kids love it, even the adult kids.
[01:33:18.136 --> 01:33:18.756]  My mom loves it.
[01:33:18.876 --> 01:33:19.357]  It's hilarious.
[01:33:19.997 --> 01:33:26.152]   And Carlos is the head chick, and he has a coup over the Easter Bunny, and he says, This is a coup d'etat.
[01:33:26.653 --> 01:33:28.655]  I'm taking over, which is French for coup d'etat.
[01:33:29.415 --> 01:33:31.838]  That queue up hop, this is French for coup d'etat.
[01:33:32.639 --> 01:33:34.481]  Just type in hop, coup d'etat.
[01:33:35.522 --> 01:33:42.949]  See, see, even in the children's movie, the coup d'etat is when the chicks overthrow the bunny rabbit.
[01:33:42.969 --> 01:33:44.491]  Okay?
[01:33:44.731 --> 01:33:52.280]   And I know the general audience gets that, but 9 times out of 10 historically, you can look it up, it's probably like 95 times out of 100.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:54.341]  I mean, it's more than 9 times out of 10.
[01:33:55.021 --> 01:34:06.447]  It's the military and another political party, like Operation Valkyrie against Hitler in World War II by the German military was attempting to overthrow Hitler.
[01:34:09.469 --> 01:34:09.669]  So...
[01:34:10.911 --> 01:34:12.312]  That's how coups generally work.
[01:34:12.352 --> 01:34:16.754]  It was a coup when they killed Kennedy in 1963 in Neely Plaza, blowing his head off.
[01:34:16.914 --> 01:34:17.714]  That's a coup.
[01:34:18.014 --> 01:34:19.135]  Go ahead and roll it with audio.
[01:34:19.155 --> 01:34:19.535]  Start it over.
[01:34:22.416 --> 01:34:28.239]  It's called a coup d'etat, which is a French for coup d'etat.
[01:34:28.259 --> 01:34:31.781]  But Carlos, you've been my most trusted number two for years.
[01:34:31.901 --> 01:34:32.441]  Well, guess what?
[01:34:32.621 --> 01:34:34.362]  I am sick of doing number two.
[01:34:34.802 --> 01:34:37.403]  It is our time for number one, yeah?
[01:34:37.703 --> 01:34:38.724]  We the bosses now!
[01:34:41.687 --> 01:34:43.949]  That is so historically important, and the front was cut off.
[01:34:43.788 --> 01:34:55.148]  Cut off, let's play that one more time.
[01:34:55.118 --> 01:34:59.061]  It's called a coup d'etat, which is a French for coup d'etat.
[01:35:00.963 --> 01:35:02.925]  But Carlos... All right, so let's stop right there.
[01:35:02.985 --> 01:35:09.390]  So the Easter Bunny's the president, and Fauci and Hillary and Obama are the Easter chick, okay?
[01:35:09.490 --> 01:35:10.391]  I mean, okay, so, so...
[01:35:11.445 --> 01:35:12.466]  That's a coup d'etat.
[01:35:13.727 --> 01:35:18.089]  But Hillary and all of them are saying, once he gets in, he'll use the military on us.
[01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:19.190]  Oh, why is that?
[01:35:19.570 --> 01:35:29.537]  Because you're going to be burning the country down with your Soros-backed Black Lives Matter and the illegal alien brigades and MS-13 and Antifa.
[01:35:30.758 --> 01:35:34.661]  So here's Hillary just putting this out because this is what they're going to do.
[01:35:35.481 --> 01:35:38.043]  So we're busy trying to win the election and stop them stealing it.
[01:35:38.723 --> 01:35:39.484]  That's important.
[01:35:40.481 --> 01:35:42.282]  But I'd say that's 60% of it.
[01:35:42.462 --> 01:35:44.983]  I think Trump's going to win by such a landslide right now.
[01:35:45.283 --> 01:35:46.183]  We're not overconfident.
[01:35:46.203 --> 01:35:50.705]  We all go out to people to vote and we watch what's going on and the political realignment is so big.
[01:35:52.106 --> 01:35:52.666]  Trump's going to win.
[01:35:53.606 --> 01:35:54.227]  They already know that.
[01:35:54.907 --> 01:35:58.988]  So now we better start talking about what they're going to do when he's president-elect.
[01:35:59.068 --> 01:36:01.569]  See, they're not going to wait until he gets in there.
[01:36:02.770 --> 01:36:07.172]  How many days from the early November election to January 20th inauguration?
[01:36:07.192 --> 01:36:07.412]  70 plus. 79.
[01:36:11.698 --> 01:36:13.519]  Remember we had 79 days of hell?
[01:36:13.619 --> 01:36:15.000]  I predicted it with a countdown.
[01:36:16.321 --> 01:36:17.322]  I said they were going to steal it.
[01:36:17.642 --> 01:36:19.003]  I said they would do all the civil unrest.
[01:36:19.463 --> 01:36:21.805]  Lord knows I didn't believe I'd walk right into their trap.
[01:36:26.348 --> 01:36:27.229]  Go ahead and roll the Hillary clip.
[01:36:28.886 --> 01:36:30.807]  Can Ukraine survive another year?
[01:36:30.947 --> 01:36:32.467]  Will the United States step up?
[01:36:33.027 --> 01:36:39.309]  And will the United States continue to be a leader of NATO, given former President Trump's recent comments?
[01:36:39.589 --> 01:36:42.050]  You know, President Biden said... You know what, I apologize.
[01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:42.830]  Let's stop right there.
[01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:45.711]  I'm not doing this for cliffhangers, but I thought the clip was shorter.
[01:36:45.751 --> 01:36:46.531]  It's three and a half minutes.
[01:36:47.176 --> 01:36:47.836]  We'll come back.
[01:36:48.197 --> 01:36:49.237]  We'll start the next hour.
[01:36:49.898 --> 01:36:56.382]  I'm going to get to that and then I'm going to get to the huge Ukraine news, which is really dangerous because they're being completely routed now.
[01:36:56.802 --> 01:37:01.845]  So if NATO is going to jump and do a false flag or something, this is a very important stack.
[01:37:01.865 --> 01:37:02.546]  We're going to get to that.
[01:37:03.066 --> 01:37:06.488]  We'll get to the illegal aliens rioting, Tedros and his world government treaty.
[01:37:06.528 --> 01:37:09.830]  He's bitching that nobody wants to ratify it because we know he's a murdering criminal.
[01:37:10.991 --> 01:37:15.334]  And we've got so much more coming up in the third hour today.
[01:37:16.578 --> 01:37:24.242]  In the last 30 minutes, we have a lawyer who's been really on top of the Assange situation to give us a breakdown on that because if they can get Assange, they can get Assange.
[01:37:24.262 --> 01:37:26.043]  They've already tortured the guy half to death.
[01:37:26.763 --> 01:37:30.325]  So they're about to extradite him here to Mordor to throw him out of the jail.
[01:37:30.385 --> 01:37:32.186]  He'll obviously die in jail if that's the case.
[01:37:32.906 --> 01:37:34.987]  Big hearing going on that just concluded in the UK.
[01:37:36.308 --> 01:37:38.289]  We've got more on Dutch cultural enrichment.
[01:37:38.869 --> 01:37:42.831]  Extreme migrant gangs cause major riot, burn police cars, greet wilders.
[01:37:46.144 --> 01:37:48.705]  I will become the Prime Minister who finally puts things in order.
[01:37:50.427 --> 01:37:56.491]  Huge developments all coming up next hour and a ton of news breaking as well.
[01:37:56.871 --> 01:37:59.453]  That's on InfoWars.com that I've not even gotten to yet.
[01:37:59.473 --> 01:38:01.934]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:38:02.094 --> 01:38:05.557]  Please keep sharing the articles, the videos from InfoWars.com.
[01:38:05.597 --> 01:38:07.898]  And remember, without your financial support, we won't be here.
[01:38:08.359 --> 01:38:10.000]  And I thank you all humbly for your support.
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:12.802]  But have we not delivered together, all of us together?
[01:38:13.342 --> 01:38:14.223]  We're kicking some ass.
[01:38:15.138 --> 01:38:16.469]  Any botherments, die.
[01:38:19.308 --> 01:38:23.549]  You can see here the Great Awakening orbiting the Great Reset.
[01:38:24.250 --> 01:38:33.992]  Although the depopulation systems of the Great Reset are not yet fully operational, the Great Reset does have a strong conspiracy network.
[01:38:34.452 --> 01:38:40.333]  It is protected by a satanic shield, which can be disabled by the Great Awakening.
[01:38:40.733 --> 01:38:46.935]  The Great Reset must be deactivated if any victory for humanity is to be accomplished.
[01:38:47.998 --> 01:39:02.043]  Once the Great Awakening deactivates the shield, InfoWars.com forward slash show will cover the truth while Info Warriors fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the Great Reset.
[01:39:02.543 --> 01:39:06.264]  Alex Jones has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.
[01:39:06.604 --> 01:39:12.566]  Get a signed copy of the Great Awakening today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:39:15.067 --> 01:39:17.248]  Media matters, the Democratic Party.
[01:39:18.252 --> 01:39:24.565]  MSNBC and others have asked me to apologize for making a parody video game criticizing the deep state and all the corruption.
[01:39:25.206 --> 01:39:27.069]  And to all them, I just want to say this.
[01:39:27.931 --> 01:39:29.113]  Go f*** yourselves!
[01:39:30.864 --> 01:39:37.171]  Alex Jones New World Order Wars has been number one on Steam thanks to the viewers and listeners of this broadcast.
[01:39:37.512 --> 01:39:50.727]  And I want to invite everyone, before they are successful at banning, which I hope they aren't, to go to alexjonesgame.com and follow the link to Steam and download this game for $17.76 as a message to the New World Order.
[01:39:51.167 --> 01:39:51.887]  F*** you!
[01:39:52.447 --> 01:40:00.450]  You want to try to ban this game just like you want to steal elections and force injections on us and open up our borders and rape us.
[01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:04.851]  This is a culture war and they're scared of this game.
[01:40:05.271 --> 01:40:14.034]  Get Alex Jones' New World Order Wars right now at AlexJonesGame.com because anything badass gets censored!
[01:40:15.214 --> 01:40:19.976]  So President Trump doesn't need to stage a coup if he gets re-elected.
[01:40:21.215 --> 01:40:30.704]  It was the deep state with the fake Russiagate and the impeachments and Obama with the illegal spying that tried a coup against Trump for four years to block him and did steal the election in 2020.
[01:40:31.485 --> 01:40:41.054]  So when Hillary comes out and says Trump's planning to use the military against the people and Trump's planning a coup, she means they're going to activate rioters and looters, which they admit they're doing.
[01:40:41.314 --> 01:40:45.058]  And then if Trump responds legally and lawfully, they're saying they're going to remove him.
[01:40:46.084 --> 01:40:49.525]  They say, oh, we can't use the Insurrection Act that George H.W.
[01:40:49.905 --> 01:40:52.606]  Bush used in 1992 in the L.A.
[01:40:52.666 --> 01:40:53.026]  riots.
[01:40:53.947 --> 01:40:55.407]  So that's what they're setting up.
[01:40:55.507 --> 01:40:56.888]  That's what they're getting ready for.
[01:40:57.188 --> 01:40:58.188]  And they're telegraphing it.
[01:40:58.228 --> 01:40:59.068]  Oh, he's a dictator.
[01:40:59.088 --> 01:41:00.209]  Oh, he's going to use the military.
[01:41:00.789 --> 01:41:06.471]  When they're the ones that have been using the Pentagon and CIA against us in election meddling and censorship and control.
[01:41:06.911 --> 01:41:10.312]  So here's Hillary Clinton totally inverting reality and projecting.
[01:41:11.409 --> 01:41:13.331]  Can Ukraine survive another year?
[01:41:13.471 --> 01:41:14.992]  Will the United States step up?
[01:41:15.573 --> 01:41:21.859]  And will the United States continue to be a leader of NATO, given former President Trump's recent comments?
[01:41:22.119 --> 01:41:29.025]  You know, President Biden said this week, supporting this bill, the one for foreign aid and military aid, is standing up to Putin.
[01:41:29.105 --> 01:41:32.348]  Opposing it is playing into Putin's hands.
[01:41:32.448 --> 01:41:32.688]  Yes.
[01:41:33.789 --> 01:41:33.969]  What?
[01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:35.471]  You're a former senator.
[01:41:36.630 --> 01:41:40.973]  You know, the Senate came kicking and screaming, but they passed it, but the House hasn't passed it.
[01:41:41.313 --> 01:41:44.796]  Where do you think, you know, in the political realm, this is going to go?
[01:41:45.136 --> 01:41:51.461]  Well, one thing I know for sure, if this bill from the Senate were ever put on the floor of the House, it would pass.
[01:41:52.101 --> 01:41:54.083]  It would pass overwhelmingly.
[01:41:54.623 --> 01:42:05.431]  Because the people who are preventing it, starting with the Speaker, Mike Johnson, are not doing America's business, they're doing Donald Trump's business.
[01:42:05.851 --> 01:42:09.054]  And why is Donald Trump so enamored of Putin?
[01:42:09.714 --> 01:42:12.197]  Well, part of it is he's a wannabe dictator.
[01:42:12.237 --> 01:42:13.798]  He has told us that repeatedly.
[01:42:14.318 --> 01:42:21.324]  He even said the other day, let's basically get out of NATO and, you know, encourage Putin to do what he wants to do.
[01:42:22.185 --> 01:42:35.118]  How absurd a statement that is, cannot even be, you know, measured, because you are essentially giving a green light to a murderous, brutal dictator.
[01:42:35.719 --> 01:42:41.545]  Nobody who is siding with Trump on this issue would want to live under that kind of regime.
[01:42:41.585 --> 01:42:46.948]   I want to ask you though, you said if it came to the floor of the House it would pass passed overwhelmingly. We know that the majority of
[01:42:46.948 --> 01:42:53.247]   Americans believe and support NATO and they want to support it. But why do you think that? Then
[01:42:53.247 --> 01:42:56.947]   why isn't it coming to the floor of the House? Well, this is one of the great political
[01:42:56.947 --> 01:43:02.936]   mysteries of our time because there are Republicans who feel that they took an oath to Donald
[01:43:02.936 --> 01:43:08.935]   Trump, not to the United States And I don't say that lightly, but I cannot understand it.
[01:43:08.955 --> 01:43:17.667]  There are people I served with in the Senate for eight years who have turned on America in order to curry favor with Trump.
[01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:19.890]  I don't recognize these people.
[01:43:20.471 --> 01:43:29.334]  These are people who I worked with, that I traveled with, and to hear what's coming out of their mouths now is just shocking to me.
[01:43:29.894 --> 01:43:41.599]   So there's something going on in this minority of the Republican members of Congress, particularly in the House, that Makes them seem as though they're a member of the Trump cult.
[01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:47.684]  Not that they took an oath to serve our country and work on behalf of their constituents.
[01:43:48.084 --> 01:43:53.789]  I'm hoping that better heads will prevail and we will get that vote.
[01:43:53.969 --> 01:43:58.872]  For those who say this is just Trump in campaign mode... No, that's not true, Christiane.
[01:43:59.833 --> 01:44:03.015]  You need to listen to him and take him seriously.
[01:44:03.635 --> 01:44:05.556]  He is telling us what he wants to do.
[01:44:05.976 --> 01:44:07.997]  He wants to be a dictator on day one.
[01:44:08.497 --> 01:44:13.780]  He wants to round up people because of the way they look.
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:15.641]  They may or may not be undocumented.
[01:44:15.741 --> 01:44:16.721]  It doesn't matter to him.
[01:44:16.761 --> 01:44:18.682]  He wants to call out the army to do that.
[01:44:18.722 --> 01:44:25.065]  He wants to use the Insurrection Act to militarize American law enforcement.
[01:44:25.405 --> 01:44:33.268]   He has a whole team of right-wing Thinkers, so to speak, who are coming up with an agenda called Project 2025.
[01:44:34.188 --> 01:44:39.269]  He wants to rid the government of any kind of independent expertise.
[01:44:39.609 --> 01:44:47.770]  So, you know, he wants people who will say when he said memorably during COVID, maybe you should inject yourself with bleach instead of looking shocked.
[01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:49.951]  They'll say, yes, sir, Mr. President.
[01:44:50.391 --> 01:44:51.271]  That's what he wants.
[01:44:51.311 --> 01:44:57.072]  He wants to bend the government of the United States to his will, just like Vladimir Putin did to Russia.
[01:44:57.774 --> 01:45:00.335]  All right, this is going to be a jam-packed third hour today.
[01:45:00.355 --> 01:45:02.816]  We're going to cover a ton of breaking news right now.
[01:45:07.157 --> 01:45:13.800]  The Red Cross, we've confirmed, is tracking people that have had the COVID shot and is not wanting their blood.
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:15.540]  This is a gigantic development.
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.001]  I'm going to cover that coming up in a little while.
[01:45:17.915 --> 01:45:21.637]  We've got big Ukraine news, which is very dangerous news.
[01:45:22.277 --> 01:45:23.938]  The Ukrainians are being completely routed now.
[01:45:23.978 --> 01:45:28.260]  The Globalists have gone from saying they're invincible to they've had their asses kicked, which has been true for a year.
[01:45:29.621 --> 01:45:33.703]  And so they're getting ready to pull something big or they're going to have to admit that Russia won.
[01:45:33.723 --> 01:45:36.144]  I don't think they're going to give up.
[01:45:36.164 --> 01:45:37.244]  They're not signaling they are.
[01:45:37.324 --> 01:45:38.625]  So something big is about to get pulled.
[01:45:38.645 --> 01:45:39.505]  We're going to talk about that.
[01:45:41.386 --> 01:45:46.549]  And I also want to just review for people the real Alex Jones Twitter account.
[01:45:48.533 --> 01:45:50.615]  With what I've just posted since 5 a.m.
[01:45:50.655 --> 01:46:06.572]  this morning, I've got four videos of crazy white people doing insane criminal stuff, just to point out how crazy people are, and I've got one video of a black guy doing a horrible thing.
[01:46:10.481 --> 01:46:13.784]  But when you notice the comments and people I know sending me messages, why are you being racist?
[01:46:14.644 --> 01:46:17.387]  I'm going to show the black people doing bad stuff, because it's going to happen.
[01:46:17.407 --> 01:46:20.069]  I'm going to show the white people and brown people and everybody else.
[01:46:21.870 --> 01:46:22.551]  That's what I'm going to do.
[01:46:24.232 --> 01:46:25.093]  Because I'm against criminals.
[01:46:28.235 --> 01:46:28.476]  Okay?
[01:46:31.238 --> 01:46:46.272]   So, excuse me, there's not four, there's six videos today of white people doing insane, crazy criminal stuff, and one video Of a young black man robbing girls selling Girl Scout cookies in Dallas, Texas.
[01:46:47.813 --> 01:46:49.955]  And the media wouldn't even show the suspect until they had video.
[01:46:49.975 --> 01:46:52.517]  They said a man just robbed girls.
[01:46:52.537 --> 01:46:54.218]  They wouldn't even show his picture so you could catch him.
[01:46:54.599 --> 01:46:57.061]  But the picture got out of the reported suspect.
[01:46:57.461 --> 01:46:59.363]  Again, it was a white guy robbing Girl Scouts.
[01:46:59.403 --> 01:47:00.664]  I'm gonna show the damn picture!
[01:47:01.384 --> 01:47:02.465]  And the media would too.
[01:47:02.625 --> 01:47:03.486]  Why don't they?
[01:47:03.506 --> 01:47:04.707]  It's not to help black people.
[01:47:05.328 --> 01:47:12.193]  It's to make sure that criminal culture that's starting to take over some of the black communities is protected to grow into a cancer that takes over.
[01:47:12.494 --> 01:47:13.575]  Not to help the black people.
[01:47:14.443 --> 01:47:20.108]  Eight out of ten crimes against black people are committed by this small sliver of black thugs.
[01:47:21.209 --> 01:47:22.971]  And the mayor of Kansas City said, don't call them thugs.
[01:47:23.111 --> 01:47:25.073]  I'll call white people thugs.
[01:47:26.174 --> 01:47:30.498]  I got video of white people shooting people for no reason and knocking people out for no reason.
[01:47:30.558 --> 01:47:31.459]  I call them thugs.
[01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:32.720]  Call them criminals.
[01:47:33.341 --> 01:47:34.002]  I post it.
[01:47:35.503 --> 01:47:37.325]  And when black people do that, I'm going to post it.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:44.701]  So yeah, here's the quote, suspect robbing the cookies and then they got to blow up his face and it's him.
[01:47:45.882 --> 01:47:46.842]  And we'll show his picture.
[01:47:47.462 --> 01:47:48.162]  Get all that ready.
[01:47:49.022 --> 01:47:50.323]  It's all on my ex account.
[01:47:50.523 --> 01:47:51.383]  We'll show him first.
[01:47:52.423 --> 01:47:53.823]  Then we'll show some of the white people.
[01:47:54.103 --> 01:47:56.824]  God, if I try to show them all, we'll run out of time.
[01:47:56.844 --> 01:47:58.084]  But I'll show some of them.
[01:47:58.144 --> 01:47:59.645]  They're all at Real Alex Jones.
[01:48:00.205 --> 01:48:03.886]  And some days I see, you know, 10 examples of black people doing bad stuff.
[01:48:04.026 --> 01:48:04.506]  I put it up.
[01:48:05.287 --> 01:48:07.649]  Some days I see 10 examples of Hispanics doing it.
[01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:08.069]  I put it up.
[01:48:08.450 --> 01:48:10.291]  Some days I see... But most days it's a mix.
[01:48:12.573 --> 01:48:14.415]  But people telling me not to post it?
[01:48:15.315 --> 01:48:16.496]  You're gonna get more of it now.
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:22.682]  I'm not a racist, I'm a realityist.
[01:48:23.402 --> 01:48:24.904]  Word I just invented, like Jesse Jackson.
[01:48:26.465 --> 01:48:27.526]  Probably invent more words than he does.
[01:48:28.446 --> 01:48:29.607]  That's how we get new words, by the way.
[01:48:29.647 --> 01:48:33.631]  People invent them, people adopt them, then it's coined, and it's a new term, like LibTard, you know.
[01:48:35.782 --> 01:48:36.502]  Left-right paradigm.
[01:48:36.522 --> 01:48:37.623]  But I digress.
[01:48:37.883 --> 01:48:39.644]  I wanted to air right now because it's really good.
[01:48:39.704 --> 01:48:41.185]  I've asked Harrison Smith to do more of these.
[01:48:41.205 --> 01:48:42.226]  He's only done two of them before.
[01:48:42.566 --> 01:48:43.366]  Now he's at a third one.
[01:48:44.167 --> 01:48:47.488]  If you want to share it, it's at RealAlexJones on X. It's also on InfoWars.com.
[01:48:51.170 --> 01:48:55.093]  Climate change pitch meeting with Harrison Smith.
[01:48:55.113 --> 01:49:02.657]  We're going to air this and then I'm going to come back and show you the craziest zombie woman you've ever seen.
[01:49:03.017 --> 01:49:04.238]  Oh, by the way, she's a white lady.
[01:49:05.174 --> 01:49:07.075]  And if she was black, I'd be showing it to you.
[01:49:08.255 --> 01:49:10.736]  But, I mean, this is what these drugs are doing to people.
[01:49:11.296 --> 01:49:13.416]  Crazy, white, zombie lady coming up.
[01:49:13.496 --> 01:49:14.997]  But first, here's the report.
[01:49:17.837 --> 01:49:19.398]  Whew, it's kinda... feels hot.
[01:49:19.678 --> 01:49:20.118]  You feel hot?
[01:49:20.518 --> 01:49:21.879]  Yeah, yeah, it's pretty warm.
[01:49:22.259 --> 01:49:24.019]  Yeah, I think we're all gonna die.
[01:49:24.059 --> 01:49:24.659]  I think this is it.
[01:49:24.679 --> 01:49:25.540]  The world's being destroyed.
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:26.420]  What?
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:27.740]  Yep, this is it.
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:28.660]  End of the world.
[01:49:29.121 --> 01:49:29.801]  The apocalypse.
[01:49:29.901 --> 01:49:30.361]  Armageddon.
[01:49:30.381 --> 01:49:34.282]  I'd say we have... three weeks left to turn this thing around.
[01:49:35.677 --> 01:49:36.918]  The worst part is, it's all your fault.
[01:49:36.978 --> 01:49:38.379]  I can't believe you've done this.
[01:49:38.679 --> 01:49:38.799]  What?
[01:49:38.939 --> 01:49:39.740]  How is this my fault?
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:43.162]  Well, you produce carbon dioxide, and there's way too much of that stuff.
[01:49:43.462 --> 01:49:43.923]  Too much?
[01:49:44.323 --> 01:49:44.903]  How much is there?
[01:49:44.964 --> 01:49:45.664]  How much is too much?
[01:49:46.445 --> 01:49:48.506]  Look, I don't even know.
[01:49:49.046 --> 01:49:53.209]  I'm not here to understand vague pseudoscientific talking points.
[01:49:53.289 --> 01:49:57.012]  I'm here to enforce insane restrictions on the basis of those talking points.
[01:49:57.452 --> 01:49:58.053]  Restrictions?
[01:49:58.573 --> 01:50:09.961]  Yeah, you know, like, uh, carbon credits, and no gas stove, and you have to eat bugs, and live in a tiny box like a bug, and, uh, injure bloodline, you know, no children, or anything, like a... like a bug.
[01:50:09.981 --> 01:50:11.702]  Okay, that is insane, yeah.
[01:50:11.842 --> 01:50:15.745]  Well, it's a crisis, a climate crisis, so we don't have time to think about this stuff.
[01:50:16.065 --> 01:50:16.926]  We're saving the Earth.
[01:50:17.406 --> 01:50:17.786]  From what?
[01:50:18.347 --> 01:50:18.947]  Well, from people.
[01:50:19.628 --> 01:50:19.748]  Yeah.
[01:50:20.809 --> 01:50:22.750]  Like other people, not like you and me, but like...
[01:50:24.042 --> 01:50:24.522]  You know, people.
[01:50:24.763 --> 01:50:25.043]  Humans.
[01:50:25.663 --> 01:50:27.164]  So you want to eliminate humans.
[01:50:27.665 --> 01:50:29.266]  Well, it's not quite that simple.
[01:50:29.306 --> 01:50:30.847]  Yeah, I feel like that should be a hard no.
[01:50:30.987 --> 01:50:31.307]  Well, no.
[01:50:31.347 --> 01:50:32.328]  See, it's math.
[01:50:32.368 --> 01:50:35.470]  We have this equation, and we're trying to get this number down to zero.
[01:50:35.990 --> 01:50:38.052]  And one of those variables is people.
[01:50:38.192 --> 01:50:38.692]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:50:38.712 --> 01:50:43.456]  We're trying to reach zero by multiplying these non-zero numbers by whatever the value of people is.
[01:50:43.516 --> 01:50:44.917]  We call it net zero.
[01:50:45.217 --> 01:50:48.179]  Okay, because people produce carbon dioxide by existing.
[01:50:48.499 --> 01:50:52.383]  Right, so it's all about switching energy production to carbon neutral sources.
[01:50:53.424 --> 01:50:53.584]  Alright.
[01:50:53.604 --> 01:50:55.145]  And also not breathing or eating.
[01:50:55.286 --> 01:50:55.826]  I'm sorry, what?
[01:50:56.026 --> 01:50:56.687]  Great news!
[01:50:56.967 --> 01:50:58.128]  We're making big progress.
[01:50:58.248 --> 01:51:04.314]  The oldest and largest power plant in all of England just went 24 hours totally carbon neutral.
[01:51:04.534 --> 01:51:06.776]  They didn't burn a single ounce of coal all day.
[01:51:07.437 --> 01:51:08.418]  What did they burn instead?
[01:51:08.838 --> 01:51:09.599]  Biomass.
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:11.281]  What is biomass?
[01:51:11.821 --> 01:51:12.321]  Trees!
[01:51:12.941 --> 01:51:15.122]  Big, beautiful trees from across the ocean.
[01:51:15.142 --> 01:51:19.322]  See, we cut them down in British Columbia, ship them across the Atlantic, and burn them for fuel.
[01:51:20.142 --> 01:51:24.223]  Wait, so just because you don't burn coal, you're calling that zero emission?
[01:51:24.623 --> 01:51:25.543]  Well, the banks do, yeah.
[01:51:26.184 --> 01:51:26.564]  The banks?
[01:51:26.844 --> 01:51:27.124]  The bank.
[01:51:27.404 --> 01:51:32.225]  The bankers, the international bankers, they're in charge of all of this because they're so selfless and caring.
[01:51:32.345 --> 01:51:34.805]  Okay, and they're making us give up combustion fuel?
[01:51:34.925 --> 01:51:38.026]  Well, not totally, just like natural gas and coal and stuff like that.
[01:51:38.066 --> 01:51:38.726]  Yeah, but not trees.
[01:51:38.766 --> 01:51:39.366]  No, not trees.
[01:51:39.406 --> 01:51:39.866]  Trees are fine.
[01:51:41.015 --> 01:51:42.035]  All right, that's crazy.
[01:51:42.555 --> 01:51:44.436]  Isn't there any other power generator source?
[01:51:44.456 --> 01:51:45.316]  Like, what about windmills?
[01:51:45.576 --> 01:51:46.756]  Oh yeah, windmills are great.
[01:51:46.836 --> 01:51:49.737]  Yeah, after like 18 years, they're carbon neutral for a couple years.
[01:51:49.777 --> 01:51:53.177]  Plus, when they freeze, you can just keep them spinning with the diesel engine.
[01:51:53.497 --> 01:51:55.378]  Also, they kill a ton of eagles.
[01:51:55.818 --> 01:51:57.018]  Uh, is that a good thing?
[01:51:57.718 --> 01:52:00.399]  I guess not, but we're saving the earth here.
[01:52:00.439 --> 01:52:07.300]  You can't make omelets without breaking a few eggs, and you can't build windmills without killing a ton of eagles and whales and chopping down two million trees in Scotland.
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:13.666]  Okay, wait, so you're burning trees for fuel, but you're also cutting down entire forests to make fields to build windmills?
[01:52:13.886 --> 01:52:17.750]  That's right, and also we're just chopping down trees and straight up burying them in the ground.
[01:52:17.810 --> 01:52:19.152]  It's a new initiative.
[01:52:20.776 --> 01:52:21.517]  I hate trees.
[01:52:22.257 --> 01:52:25.159]  Don't trees, like, absorb carbon dioxide?
[01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:28.262]  No, that's what my giant vacuum machine is for.
[01:52:28.282 --> 01:52:29.022]  It's huge.
[01:52:29.763 --> 01:52:31.784]  Okay, this is, this is getting weird.
[01:52:32.525 --> 01:52:32.865]  Windmills.
[01:52:33.405 --> 01:52:34.226]  Windmills work, though.
[01:52:34.506 --> 01:52:37.348]  Yeah, windmills work great, unless there's, you know, too much wind.
[01:52:38.109 --> 01:52:39.190]  Okay, what about solar panels?
[01:52:39.670 --> 01:52:43.173]  Solar panels, also fantastic, unless there's, you know, too much sun.
[01:52:43.193 --> 01:52:45.615]  Alright, what about nuclear energy?
[01:52:45.815 --> 01:52:45.955]  No.
[01:52:46.727 --> 01:52:47.987]  Alright, well, what about cars?
[01:52:48.007 --> 01:52:49.287]  I mean, cars run on gasoline.
[01:52:49.407 --> 01:52:50.108]  So, what about them?
[01:52:50.328 --> 01:52:52.768]  Actually, every car is going to be electric from now on.
[01:52:53.208 --> 01:52:54.828]  Can the power grid handle that?
[01:52:55.029 --> 01:52:55.929]  Every car being electric?
[01:52:56.729 --> 01:52:56.929]  No.
[01:52:57.489 --> 01:52:57.669]  No.
[01:52:58.149 --> 01:52:59.489]  So, I don't get it.
[01:52:59.529 --> 01:53:00.349]  How are people going to drive?
[01:53:00.369 --> 01:53:02.790]  How are you going to drive when you don't own a car?
[01:53:03.010 --> 01:53:04.270]  What do you mean, I won't own a car?
[01:53:04.290 --> 01:53:05.230]  I mean, how will I get anywhere?
[01:53:05.250 --> 01:53:05.730]  Oh, it's easy.
[01:53:05.770 --> 01:53:07.251]  Everybody will share a small amount of cars.
[01:53:07.271 --> 01:53:13.412]  You'll have an app like Uber where you can request a ride and also apply for a transit permit to leave the 15-minute perimeter.
[01:53:13.812 --> 01:53:13.972]  What?
[01:53:14.592 --> 01:53:15.633]  15-minute perimeter.
[01:53:15.673 --> 01:53:19.035]  Yeah, the one I'm gonna put around you, it's called an ultra-low-emission zone.
[01:53:19.535 --> 01:53:22.658]  It's a core aspect of the sustainability development goals.
[01:53:22.958 --> 01:53:26.600]  It's where you can't leave your neighborhood, and don't own a car, and never fly, and can't eat meat.
[01:53:27.281 --> 01:53:29.322]  Look, you're never gonna get these laws passed.
[01:53:29.402 --> 01:53:30.503]  No, they'll pass.
[01:53:31.023 --> 01:53:32.264]  Just, uh, not through law.
[01:53:32.364 --> 01:53:33.765]  No, I'm just gonna sort of do it.
[01:53:34.245 --> 01:53:37.247]  See, I don't have to pass a law to make beef illegal.
[01:53:37.347 --> 01:53:39.549]  I'll just buy the cattle farms and shut them down.
[01:53:40.149 --> 01:53:42.751]  See, I, uh, control the market with my incredible wealth.
[01:53:43.151 --> 01:53:44.152]  You control the market?
[01:53:45.173 --> 01:53:45.533]  That's right.
[01:53:46.394 --> 01:53:49.758]  So are you the one that offshored all of our manufacturing to China?
[01:53:51.199 --> 01:53:51.820]  Yeah, that was me.
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:57.605]  You mean China, where there's no environmental controls at all, the number one polluter on Earth?
[01:53:58.326 --> 01:53:58.767]  No.
[01:53:59.667 --> 01:54:00.448]  No, that can't be right.
[01:54:01.693 --> 01:54:02.473]  No, no way.
[01:54:02.493 --> 01:54:04.174]  That would be... That would be crazy.
[01:54:04.674 --> 01:54:05.094]  Okay, look.
[01:54:05.614 --> 01:54:12.875]  I'm an environmentalist, but can't we just do normal things like animal preservations, nature reserves, recycling?
[01:54:13.295 --> 01:54:13.736]  No, no, no.
[01:54:13.956 --> 01:54:16.136]  That's not how environmentalism works anymore.
[01:54:16.176 --> 01:54:22.477]  From now on, all environmental or ecological concern will be subsumed within the climate change carbon neutral agenda.
[01:54:22.877 --> 01:54:25.698]  See, carbon is responsible for everything.
[01:54:25.958 --> 01:54:32.560]   Hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, pandemics, heart attacks, Mass immigration, teenage mental health.
[01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:40.162]  I mean, do you have any idea how traumatizing it is for a child to constantly be told that the Earth itself is dying and that it's their fault?
[01:54:40.663 --> 01:54:42.343]  Okay, so why do you keep doing it?
[01:54:42.723 --> 01:54:43.824]  Because the time is now.
[01:54:45.144 --> 01:54:45.424]  Uh, what?
[01:54:45.604 --> 01:54:46.825]  Because Earth can't wait.
[01:54:48.405 --> 01:54:49.206]  What's happening here?
[01:54:49.786 --> 01:54:52.027]  Because we will be the generation of change.
[01:54:52.687 --> 01:54:54.307]  Are you just saying slogans at me?
[01:54:54.487 --> 01:54:55.908]  Climate change is racist.
[01:54:57.725 --> 01:55:00.067]  Okay, I don't understand what's happening here.
[01:55:01.027 --> 01:55:01.407]  That's fine.
[01:55:01.427 --> 01:55:02.368]  You don't need to understand.
[01:55:02.388 --> 01:55:04.069]  You just eat your bugs.
[01:55:04.129 --> 01:55:07.591]  My engineers are hard at work spraying metal particles into the air to block out the sun.
[01:55:08.412 --> 01:55:10.333]  Please, don't do that.
[01:55:10.633 --> 01:55:11.854]  Look, this is an emergency.
[01:55:11.874 --> 01:55:16.838]  I don't have time to stand here and argue with you about my asinine weather modification programs.
[01:55:16.938 --> 01:55:18.459]  The fact is, it's happening.
[01:55:18.479 --> 01:55:25.984]  Your pipeline is shut down, your backyard garden is illegal, and your water is filled with microplastics, which I put in there because I'm into that sort of thing.
[01:55:26.764 --> 01:55:31.906]  So the fact is, this is happening, you're helping me, or I swear to God, I will throw soup all over the museum!
[01:55:33.476 --> 01:55:33.676]  What?
[01:55:34.116 --> 01:55:36.897]  I will glue my hand to the ground right here, right now.
[01:55:36.958 --> 01:55:37.738]  I'll block the traffic.
[01:55:38.158 --> 01:55:44.081]  I mean, a blocked ambulance is a small price to pay to insist that the government do something it's already doing to a suicidal degree.
[01:55:44.681 --> 01:55:45.001]  You know what?
[01:55:46.041 --> 01:55:46.282]  Fine.
[01:55:46.682 --> 01:55:47.002]  It's fine.
[01:55:47.322 --> 01:55:50.423]  Great, because I gotta go catch a helicopter to the airport.
[01:55:50.443 --> 01:55:53.825]  Me and John Kerry are gonna race our private jets across the ocean for fun, alright?
[01:55:53.845 --> 01:55:54.445]  I'll see you later.
[01:55:54.485 --> 01:55:56.226]  By the way, no children, no bloodline.
[01:55:56.306 --> 01:55:56.966]  Bloodline's over.
[01:55:56.806 --> 01:56:07.686]  No children.
[01:56:07.751 --> 01:56:09.613]  We need those weekly.
[01:56:09.973 --> 01:56:10.333]  Wow!
[01:56:10.413 --> 01:56:12.295]  It's at RealAlexJonesInfoWars.com.
[01:56:12.355 --> 01:56:14.277]  Watch Climate Change Pitch Meeting.
[01:56:14.717 --> 01:56:17.419]  Share it like your life depends on it, because it does.
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:19.862]  And oh, look what I have in the news today.
[01:56:20.522 --> 01:56:22.384]  Just bolstering what he just said.
[01:56:22.464 --> 01:56:23.365]  Everything he said is true.
[01:56:25.246 --> 01:56:28.990]  CNN calls for limits to how often Americans can travel abroad.
[01:56:30.151 --> 01:56:32.353]  Carbon passports may be the answer.
[01:56:33.993 --> 01:56:40.896]  So they can fly around on their private jets all day, but you're going to be limited to only a few air travel trips a year.
[01:56:43.857 --> 01:56:47.559]  Starting to figure out what this is.
[01:56:47.759 --> 01:56:48.099]  All right.
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:53.621]  So, I've been on FX, formerly Twitter, for five years.
[01:56:55.322 --> 01:56:57.143]  We came roaring back on three months ago.
[01:56:58.536 --> 01:57:08.064]  And when I see streets full of zombies on fentanyl and piles of garbage and police being shot, if it's a black cop being shot by a white guy, I show it.
[01:57:08.864 --> 01:57:11.046]  If it's a black guy shooting a white cop, I show it.
[01:57:11.186 --> 01:57:17.871]  If it's blacks doing knockout games and robbing whites and saying racist things, which the media then tries to cover up, I show it.
[01:57:18.011 --> 01:57:19.312]  Why are they covering it up?
[01:57:20.814 --> 01:57:27.139]  Because the CIA funded the whole gangster culture in the 80s, shipped in the cocaine, it's all declassified, Ice Cubes talked about it, he witnessed it.
[01:57:28.018 --> 01:57:32.720]  We want to say that's wrong and not defund the police and go in and help those communities.
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:35.681]  Eight out of ten blacks that are attacked are attacked by black people.
[01:57:35.822 --> 01:57:39.163]  I'm trying to stop innocent black children being the majority of abortions.
[01:57:40.564 --> 01:57:45.426]  But I also don't want those children brainwashed into anti-white thugs that come out and attack me.
[01:57:46.987 --> 01:57:56.731]  So, I was sitting there this morning and I posted six clips, I said four earlier, it was six clips, this is what I came across, of crazy white people.
[01:57:58.473 --> 01:58:14.729]  Knocking women out, throwing women in front of trains, racing down the highway from police, killing themselves, running into the back of an 18-wheeler, zombie woman attacking, trying to break into a black family's home, a white woman, crazy white lady.
[01:58:15.999 --> 01:58:17.699]  Obviously whacked out of our mind on a bunch of drugs.
[01:58:17.919 --> 01:58:21.300]  I just show it to show, because the statistics show this is happening.
[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:22.981]  It's not just like we're picking and choosing.
[01:58:23.621 --> 01:58:25.541]  There's cameras everywhere now so we see more of this.
[01:58:25.561 --> 01:58:26.101]  That's part of it.
[01:58:26.422 --> 01:58:28.462]  But we're living less.
[01:58:28.722 --> 01:58:30.803]  Our life expectancies are down.
[01:58:30.923 --> 01:58:32.323]  Our fertility is down.
[01:58:33.763 --> 01:58:36.824]  The Cheerios and Quaker Oats is a chemical that sterilizes you.
[01:58:37.084 --> 01:58:37.884]  Mainstream news.
[01:58:38.184 --> 01:58:40.385]  They're giving us poison shots regardless of what color we are.
[01:58:42.233 --> 01:58:47.454]  And then I will publish these videos where you see black professors saying, we're going to kill all the white people.
[01:58:47.514 --> 01:58:49.295]  They're funded by the big banks of the university.
[01:58:49.515 --> 01:58:52.916]  I don't want to see a white professor get up and say, we're going to murder all the black people.
[01:58:53.156 --> 01:58:55.256]  If I saw that, I'd say fire that professor.
[01:58:55.476 --> 01:58:57.197]  That's not free speech, it's a call for violence.
[01:58:58.897 --> 01:59:05.339]  But the feds have got to have the blood tribe and the patriot front totally federally run.
[01:59:05.739 --> 01:59:07.659]  Even the blood tribe admits they're feds.
[01:59:07.759 --> 01:59:08.820]  CIA they admit.
[01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:15.546]   They go recruit Aryan Brotherhood out of the prisons.
[01:59:15.566 --> 01:59:19.228]  They say you get out earlier if you go under this guy and do this with the FBI.
[01:59:19.388 --> 01:59:22.770]  And then they show up at leftist events, create the illusion of white supremacy everywhere.
[01:59:23.050 --> 01:59:23.910]  We expose it.
[01:59:25.631 --> 01:59:26.551]  And we post it all.
[01:59:27.392 --> 01:59:39.218]  But because I've gotten a lot of complaints, not just from people on X, though the videos get millions of views apiece, but from people I know saying, Jones, you're getting involved in the racism in the division.
[01:59:39.952 --> 01:59:50.117]  No, it's not division when I show footage of black people trying to vote in the early 1960s in Alabama, or trying to protest, and police dogs being released on them, and they're shot with water cannons.
[01:59:50.177 --> 01:59:50.917]  That's wrong.
[01:59:52.198 --> 01:59:55.379]  And when I've seen a few clips of Russians doing war crimes, I've shown it.
[01:59:55.679 --> 02:00:05.664]  But nine times out of ten, I haven't even shown the footage of a Russian town being bombed with drones, bombing bus stations with women and children.
[02:00:06.625 --> 02:00:07.325]  That's up there.
[02:00:09.079 --> 02:00:17.825]  I show evil things so that we can see it and face it and deal with it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:19.747 --> 02:00:22.468]  That's what this is all about.
[02:00:25.711 --> 02:00:29.253]  So, a new video came out up in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
[02:00:30.474 --> 02:00:37.379]  A young black man walks up in a gray hoodie, points a gun at little kids, selling Girl Scout cookies and robs their money bucks.
[02:00:38.248 --> 02:00:39.649]  If a white guy did it, I'd show it.
[02:00:41.130 --> 02:00:41.750]  We do show it.
[02:00:42.091 --> 02:00:43.071]  But that's not the issue.
[02:00:43.452 --> 02:00:49.596]  The issue is, the police wouldn't even release, I've got the articles right here, the race of the person.
[02:00:49.656 --> 02:00:51.997]  Instead, a man in a grey hoodie.
[02:00:53.819 --> 02:00:57.101]  They had the CCTV video of him doing the robbery and all of it.
[02:00:57.501 --> 02:00:58.342]  They didn't release it.
[02:00:59.262 --> 02:01:01.864]  Imagine the control of that police department.
[02:01:01.884 --> 02:01:02.985]  Fort Worth Police is where it happened.
[02:01:03.772 --> 02:01:05.052]  I say Dallas because I'm from Dallas.
[02:01:05.072 --> 02:01:06.333]  You call everything Dallas when you're up there.
[02:01:06.613 --> 02:01:07.253]  Everybody else does.
[02:01:07.513 --> 02:01:07.933]  Fort Worth.
[02:01:07.953 --> 02:01:09.753]  You may see any.
[02:01:10.053 --> 02:01:11.214]  Western suburb of Dallas.
[02:01:13.814 --> 02:01:20.736]  Show the video of him, this man reportedly, robbing the little girls selling cookies.
[02:01:22.636 --> 02:01:23.176]  Walks up.
[02:01:25.257 --> 02:01:26.257]  Grabs a cash box.
[02:01:28.598 --> 02:01:29.118]  Runs off.
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:37.965]  And the media says, what did they say at the Kansas City NFL parade last week?
[02:01:39.006 --> 02:01:41.287]  White men robbed, no it was two black men.
[02:01:41.607 --> 02:01:46.611]  And again, it's not blaming black people in general, it's saying why is the media doing that?
[02:01:46.871 --> 02:01:51.434]  Because they don't want to admit the major problem, they want to blame all gun owners.
[02:01:52.665 --> 02:01:54.507]  Law-abiding blacks, whites, everybody.
[02:01:55.208 --> 02:02:01.376]  The majority of black people are great people, but there is a small, heavily active minority of black males out doing this.
[02:02:02.349 --> 02:02:03.970]  There's a bunch of other people committing crimes, too.
[02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:13.134]  But that is the out-of-control group, because they're fatherless, whatever, that's doing it, and the media doesn't want you to know, and then turns around and says white people are doing it.
[02:02:13.834 --> 02:02:17.616]  It's not about blaming black people, it's about showing how the media is lying.
[02:02:18.357 --> 02:02:20.498]  What do you think that young black man does in his community?
[02:02:20.718 --> 02:02:21.958]  You think he just robs white people?
[02:02:22.439 --> 02:02:22.999]  Or little kids?
[02:02:25.410 --> 02:02:29.452]  So here's a new video that's got like 40 million views on X since it broke yesterday.
[02:02:29.492 --> 02:02:36.277]  It's a black man and woman and there's a white zombie lady out of her mind, this is happening everywhere, trying to break in their property.
[02:02:38.658 --> 02:02:41.180]  And of course I posted it to show how crazy this is.
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:44.762]  Now did anybody say, why are you bashing white people?
[02:02:45.442 --> 02:02:46.903]  See, you've got race on your mind.
[02:02:48.624 --> 02:02:53.518]   If this was two white people and a crazy black zombie, Crazy black woman doing this.
[02:02:54.279 --> 02:02:56.021]  By the way, I got a crazy black woman I posted.
[02:02:56.042 --> 02:02:58.545]  Comes to the black man's door, says, I want to have sex with you.
[02:02:58.866 --> 02:03:00.047]  She's got a machete in her hand.
[02:03:00.508 --> 02:03:03.272]  I showed it because it shows the breakdown of civilization.
[02:03:03.292 --> 02:03:04.614]  It wasn't about bashing a black woman.
[02:03:06.156 --> 02:03:07.778]  It's about how crazy stuff's getting.
[02:03:08.709 --> 02:03:15.973]  I had footage today of white people randomly knocking women out and randomly throwing women into oncoming traffic.
[02:03:16.513 --> 02:03:17.674]  I didn't show it because they're white.
[02:03:18.134 --> 02:03:19.395]  I showed it because it's crazy.
[02:03:19.575 --> 02:03:25.398]  When I show the fentanyl videos of black, white, and Hispanic like zombies, I'm showing it to draw attention to it.
[02:03:26.659 --> 02:03:27.700]  So here's a compilation.
[02:03:28.843 --> 02:03:32.005]  Of the latest zombie lady, and then a bunch of other liberal zombies.
[02:03:32.065 --> 02:03:35.366]  Notice they're almost all white, and they act like demon-possessed people.
[02:03:35.947 --> 02:03:36.847]  Am I blaming white people?
[02:03:36.907 --> 02:03:37.107]  No.
[02:03:37.447 --> 02:03:42.050]  I'm saying, when you go to Democrat events, it is the white people that act demon-possessed.
[02:03:42.170 --> 02:03:43.010]  I'm just pointing it out.
[02:03:43.370 --> 02:03:47.492]  It is a small sliver of black males that are committing a large portion of the crime.
[02:03:47.672 --> 02:03:48.833]  I'm just stating facts here.
[02:03:49.153 --> 02:03:49.974]  What's going on?
[02:03:50.014 --> 02:03:50.434]  Here it is.
[02:03:51.932 --> 02:03:59.774]  So it's about, uh, I'm not really exactly sure what time it is, but my wife is on the phone because this right here is going on.
[02:03:59.794 --> 02:04:04.836]  So this is still happening.
[02:04:05.596 --> 02:04:09.317]  So now we got some cops rolling up here.
[02:04:09.157 --> 02:04:11.157]  So this is still happening.
[02:04:11.157 --> 02:04:14.157]  So now we got some cops rolling up here.
[02:04:14.157 --> 02:04:16.157]  This shit right here.
[02:04:16.157 --> 02:04:19.157]  That's some wild business.
[02:04:19.157 --> 02:04:22.157]  Man, I see you're the wrong motherfucker.
[02:04:22.157 --> 02:04:32.157]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:30.942]  Baby, come on around here.
[02:04:30.982 --> 02:04:32.102]  This is what I'm talking about.
[02:04:32.162 --> 02:04:33.702]  This is crazy business right here.
[02:04:34.783 --> 02:04:42.745]  I won't let my dog, but... Oh, shit.
[02:04:42.765 --> 02:04:45.945]  This right here is the wildest business I've seen in a long-ass time.
[02:04:47.366 --> 02:04:48.346]  Yo, you good, son?
[02:04:49.308 --> 02:04:49.569]  I am.
[02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:51.730]  I told you I'm from Africa.
[02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:52.631]  You know me.
[02:04:53.212 --> 02:04:54.893]  Uptown.
[02:04:55.053 --> 02:04:56.074]  Yeah, what you doing up here?
[02:04:57.075 --> 02:04:58.817]  Because I think I was looking for you.
[02:04:58.837 --> 02:05:00.398]  What you looking for me for?
[02:05:01.299 --> 02:05:01.880]  I like you.
[02:05:04.142 --> 02:05:05.223]  Oh, you got the wrong door, ma'am.
[02:05:05.463 --> 02:05:05.723]  Yeah.
[02:05:06.504 --> 02:05:06.864]  Yeah.
[02:05:07.144 --> 02:05:08.385]  I got the right person.
[02:05:08.966 --> 02:05:10.107]  Maybe it's the wrong address.
[02:05:10.207 --> 02:05:10.627]  Please.
[02:05:11.168 --> 02:05:12.109]  Yeah, it's the wrong address.
[02:05:12.642 --> 02:05:13.803]  I'm not female.
[02:05:14.403 --> 02:05:16.725]  There is a difference between female and woman.
[02:05:17.285 --> 02:05:20.287]  Female is just for your pussy, for your dick and money.
[02:05:21.187 --> 02:05:22.989]  I'm from Africa, I cook clean.
[02:05:23.909 --> 02:05:26.909]  Good laugh, but juicy tits.
[02:05:26.909 --> 02:05:32.909]  I'm going home.
[02:05:32.909 --> 02:05:36.109]  Whether or not, you know, something's...
[02:05:36.896 --> 02:05:41.896]  What the?
[02:05:41.896 --> 02:05:44.396]  [MUSIC]
[02:05:44.396 --> 02:05:48.936]   When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk fear.
[02:05:48.936 --> 02:05:58.935]  [MUSIC]
[02:05:58.935 --> 02:06:00.935]  We're not planning favors of these kids.
[02:06:00.935 --> 02:06:02.935]  [MUSIC]
[02:06:02.935 --> 02:06:04.935]  No, I want the home of the free.
[02:06:04.935 --> 02:06:08.935]  [APPLAUSE]
[02:06:08.935 --> 02:06:12.935]  America, we are the mafia.
[02:06:12.935 --> 02:06:15.935]  [APPLAUSE]
[02:06:15.935 --> 02:06:20.935]   America, the home of the free and the land of the dead.
[02:06:21.595 --> 02:06:24.595]  Donald J. Trump is now president of the United States.
[02:06:24.595 --> 02:06:27.595]  [crowd cheering]
[02:06:27.595 --> 02:06:30.595]  [crowd screaming]
[02:06:30.595 --> 02:06:33.595]  [crowd screaming]

[02:06:39.595 --> 02:06:42.595]  [crowd screaming]
[02:06:42.595 --> 02:06:47.595]   When you look at the videos of all the people that quote took the Pfizer shot, they all have that crazy look.
[02:06:47.317 --> 02:06:51.979]  You look at the Kansas City shooter that shot 23 people, the black guy, he has that same crazy look.
[02:06:52.239 --> 02:06:54.941]  Look at the white lady attacking the black people, she has the same crazy look.
[02:06:55.461 --> 02:06:57.062]  It's demonic, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:57.522 --> 02:07:00.283]  Something is going on with these people.
[02:07:00.323 --> 02:07:02.424]  They've lost their minds.
[02:07:02.824 --> 02:07:04.025]  Look at the people taking the shots.
[02:07:04.405 --> 02:07:05.246]  Look at their eyes.
[02:07:06.606 --> 02:07:07.527]  The eyes, Chico.
[02:07:07.567 --> 02:07:09.888]  It's always in the eyes, as Tony Montana says.
[02:07:10.708 --> 02:07:12.089]  The eyes never lie, Chico.
[02:07:13.616 --> 02:07:16.238]  All right, big guest coming up on Julian Assange straight ahead.

[02:08:26.950 --> 02:08:36.500]  All right, since I've been on air for two and a half hours, I'm going to host some of the fourth hour now because of the breaking news.
[02:08:37.902 --> 02:08:41.306]  There have been three big developments on the COVID tyranny rollout.
[02:08:42.250 --> 02:08:42.870]  that are huge.
[02:08:43.070 --> 02:08:48.393]  We have a top FDA official admits the government covered up vaccine deaths and injuries.
[02:08:48.753 --> 02:08:49.974]  It's video in Congress.
[02:08:50.794 --> 02:08:51.994]  That is just insane.
[02:08:52.475 --> 02:08:56.056]  I was also sent this by insiders in the medical system just now.
[02:08:56.617 --> 02:09:04.780]  New Colorado Bat Lab location CSU confirmed to develop CDC Tier 1 select agents like Ebola despite university's denials.
[02:09:05.701 --> 02:09:06.681]  That is all breaking.
[02:09:07.622 --> 02:09:14.204]   And then we've now confirmed that The major blood companies do not want COVID vaccinated people for blood.
[02:09:15.725 --> 02:09:18.566]  People saw this this Red Cross announcement, didn't know it was real.
[02:09:18.606 --> 02:09:19.646]  We called the Red Cross.
[02:09:19.706 --> 02:09:20.246]  We checked it.
[02:09:21.286 --> 02:09:21.907]  It's going down.
[02:09:23.187 --> 02:09:28.689]  So, so, so, so, so the wheels are coming off very, very quickly here.
[02:09:29.829 --> 02:09:31.730]  Meanwhile, I'll cover this too next hour.
[02:09:34.002 --> 02:09:39.466]  They've now shifted and said, OK, Ukraine's totally routed and the Russians are pushing them all out of those eastern areas.
[02:09:39.986 --> 02:09:41.107]  And so what are we going to do?
[02:09:41.267 --> 02:09:42.568]  Well, that's false flag time.
[02:09:43.188 --> 02:09:47.091]  So I'm going to hit that before this transmission ends, before I hand the baton to Maria Zee a little bit in the next hour.
[02:09:47.371 --> 02:09:48.952]  And she knows when she signs up to the fourth hour.
[02:09:48.992 --> 02:09:50.193]  Sometimes I take some of it.
[02:09:50.213 --> 02:09:50.833]  Everybody knows that.
[02:09:50.853 --> 02:09:51.934]  So I'm not being rude when I do that.
[02:09:52.274 --> 02:09:53.195]  There's just so much news.
[02:09:53.715 --> 02:09:57.477]  Now, Julian Assange, in my view, is a hero.
[02:09:58.558 --> 02:09:59.519]  And so is Edward Snowden.
[02:10:00.459 --> 02:10:04.710]   And we learned through them what we already Do part of, but we learned it all.
[02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:11.992]  Totally legal activity, total surveillance, election meddling, all sorts of weird crimes going on.
[02:10:12.452 --> 02:10:14.592]  He's been in solitary confinement for years.
[02:10:14.632 --> 02:10:19.013]  He's been on house arrest for basically a decade, nine years plus.
[02:10:19.753 --> 02:10:22.214]  And now they've had a big hearing in the UK about extradition.
[02:10:22.234 --> 02:10:25.975]  They're gonna get him with the Espionage Act, over 100 years in prison, a death sentence.
[02:10:26.495 --> 02:10:31.516]  Here's the headline, Julian Assange's father, my fight to free son, whose childhood I missed.
[02:10:32.951 --> 02:10:34.632]  And it just goes on from there.
[02:10:34.672 --> 02:10:36.113]  This was a big hearing in the UK.
[02:10:36.573 --> 02:10:38.915]  Amy Peekoff is a lawyer.
[02:10:39.835 --> 02:10:46.820]  She's an esteemed expert on censorship, government surveillance within the tech industry, particularly well-versed third-party doctrine of Section 702.
[02:10:47.500 --> 02:10:59.768]  Her extensive experience, former CEO of Parler, navigating de-platforming and increased censorship, has endowed her with a unique perspective on the critical role platforms like BitChute play in preserving free speech.
[02:11:00.268 --> 02:11:05.532]  Because that then forces the bigger places like X to be somewhat free, because they know that little ones are going to get bigger if they don't.
[02:11:06.032 --> 02:11:14.559]  Amy's also a professor at the Federalist Society, where she continues to champion the cause of open discourse and free expression in today's landscapebitchute.com.
[02:11:16.119 --> 02:11:19.560]  So, you're a lawyer, you're on this, you're big on the Assange thing.
[02:11:20.021 --> 02:11:24.362]  I've been trying to follow it as best I can, but you've really had your ear to the ground on this.
[02:11:25.062 --> 02:11:26.223]  Why is this so important?
[02:11:26.263 --> 02:11:31.645]  What's happening with Assange right now, and what can we do to try to save this person that is such a hero?
[02:11:32.265 --> 02:11:34.506]  And again, where's the rest of the press defending him?
[02:11:36.026 --> 02:11:37.527]  Daniel Ellsberg was a hero.
[02:11:37.827 --> 02:11:40.087]  He did exactly what Julian Assange did.
[02:11:40.127 --> 02:11:44.589]  So, how is Daniel Ellsberg a hero, and how is Julian Assange an evil person?
[02:11:46.482 --> 02:12:07.988]  You know, it's interesting because I watched the Mike Benz Tour de Force with Tucker last night, and it put into perspective the way in which this case stands for free expression and particularly journalism in the traditional Jeffersonian sense versus authoritarian statism.
[02:12:08.028 --> 02:12:15.932]   And in particular, our military, our intelligence, so-called intelligence It's the mainstream media who is being conspicuously silent.
[02:12:15.752 --> 02:12:17.752]  agencies, right?
[02:12:17.752 --> 02:12:21.752]  They're cronies and of course the mainstream media.
[02:12:21.752 --> 02:12:25.752]   And as you point out, Alex, it's the mainstream media who is being
[02:12:25.752 --> 02:12:28.752]  conspicuously silent.
[02:12:28.752 --> 02:12:32.752]   They should be defending Assange because whatever wrongdoing you might
[02:12:32.752 --> 02:12:38.752]   think Assange has done, he has more than paid the price for it with
[02:12:38.752 --> 02:12:42.752]   the seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy and then five years in prison
[02:12:42.752 --> 02:12:44.752]  after that.
[02:12:44.945 --> 02:12:46.625]  He should be freed today.
[02:12:48.546 --> 02:12:49.066]  Absolutely.
[02:12:49.106 --> 02:12:50.386]  Tell folks what he's facing.
[02:12:52.147 --> 02:12:56.868]  So right now he is facing a possible almost immediate extradition.
[02:12:56.928 --> 02:13:02.109]  I understand that he could be put on a plane as early as Wednesday tomorrow.
[02:13:02.905 --> 02:13:09.547]  If things don't turn out his way in court, and I could talk a little bit about how that might go for him in a minute or two.
[02:13:10.067 --> 02:13:18.569]  But if he's brought here to United States, some think that with his fragile condition of health, that could be a death sentence in itself, just the transport.
[02:13:19.149 --> 02:13:29.032]  And then of course, as you said, I think 175 years in prison is the maximum sentence for the so-called espionage charges that he's facing.
[02:13:29.940 --> 02:13:42.391]  In my view, somebody who has been, you know, called alternatively a whistleblower and or a journalist, and both of those are, you know, potentially the right label for him, that person is not a spy.
[02:13:42.411 --> 02:13:47.275]  And why is it that Chelsea Manning had a commuted sentence under Obama?
[02:13:47.295 --> 02:13:48.276]  It makes no sense.
[02:13:49.817 --> 02:13:52.419]  Well, Julian just needs to say he's a woman, I guess.
[02:13:52.459 --> 02:13:53.180]  I'm not joking.
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:57.283]  And then maybe they'll let him out, because then they can just kind of destroy- That was Vivek's comment, right?
[02:13:58.066 --> 02:13:58.587]  Well, that's it.
[02:13:58.627 --> 02:14:01.069]  They're afraid if Assange gets out, what a leader he'll be.
[02:14:01.089 --> 02:14:06.134]  That's A. And B, they want to send a message to any other journalists, don't expose our war crimes.
[02:14:07.595 --> 02:14:08.276]  Yes, yes.
[02:14:08.516 --> 02:14:18.366]  And because, you know, as again, Jefferson held that the principal reason for free expression was to hold the powers that be in the government accountable.
[02:14:19.215 --> 02:14:33.591]  Right, and we have seen that increasingly our military institutions and our surveillance institutions and their cronies... They're erasing what Jefferson said was the final check on the power.
[02:14:35.033 --> 02:14:36.835]  Yes, that's what they would like to do and they do.
[02:14:36.875 --> 02:14:37.996]  They want to send that message.
[02:14:38.056 --> 02:14:39.638]  They want to instill fear.
[02:14:39.846 --> 02:14:45.206]   in people like you and other journalists who expose the truth day in and day out.
[02:14:45.206 --> 02:14:49.846]   And, you know, again, as Ben's laid out that story so beautifully,
[02:14:49.846 --> 02:14:59.205]   they are realizing that online, all of these platforms, is, you know, this whole thing that they can't control.
[02:14:59.241 --> 02:15:12.912]  They had controlled the mainstream media for decades and then found that individuals and enterprising journalists could go online and freely share the information that would expose their abuse of power.
[02:15:17.771 --> 02:15:18.572]  What can we do?
[02:15:18.932 --> 02:15:28.921]  Because I feel, I feel empowered on so many fronts, we get a lot done, but with Assange, they've drawn a clear line, and obviously he got set up by CIA sex operatives, that's all admitted.
[02:15:30.022 --> 02:15:37.169]  I've had them try the same thing on me, and thank God I don't cheat on my wife, so it never happened, but I mean, literally, two woman teams, the whole nine yards.
[02:15:38.250 --> 02:15:55.246]   I don't want to say Julian was naive, so I don't blame him for what he did, but I mean, He's had plenty of time to think about it now, but it's just, I guess I'm just really trying to figure out how we can help him, because obviously, they can get us songs, they can get us all.
[02:15:57.045 --> 02:16:04.389]  Yeah, I mean, the biggest thing right now, of course, is to speak out unequivocally in favor of him being freed immediately.
[02:16:04.849 --> 02:16:09.052]  Because again, if you think there's any wrongdoing, he's more than paid the price for it.
[02:16:09.472 --> 02:16:11.373]  He deserves to be freed now.
[02:16:11.493 --> 02:16:13.274]  He should not be facing extradition.
[02:16:13.094 --> 02:16:18.054]   I mean, certainly at the very least, he should be granted the appeal that he's trying to
[02:16:18.054 --> 02:16:20.654]  get in the court today.
[02:16:20.654 --> 02:16:30.132]   So right now, sorry, somebody is sending me a text about a quote on the wall behind me,
[02:16:30.132 --> 02:16:31.493]  distracting me for a second.
[02:16:31.476 --> 02:16:36.417]  So right now he is facing a two-judge panel in the UK, two high court judges.
[02:16:36.877 --> 02:16:41.038]  One of them is Justice Jeremy Johnson and the other is Dame Victoria Sharpe.
[02:16:41.498 --> 02:16:51.700]  I want to call your attention to an article and, oh gosh, I'm trying to, I'm going to get the source for you, Alex, later.
[02:16:52.445 --> 02:16:53.186]  I think it's U.K.
[02:16:53.206 --> 02:16:54.047]  Declassified.
[02:16:54.207 --> 02:16:54.467]  U.K.
[02:16:54.487 --> 02:16:56.309]  Declassified is the source for this article.
[02:16:56.349 --> 02:16:59.052]  There's two authors, co-authors of this.
[02:16:59.072 --> 02:16:59.953]  Go find it.
[02:17:00.353 --> 02:17:05.379]  But there's a long list of Justice Jeremy Johnson's conflict of interests.
[02:17:05.979 --> 02:17:10.084]  And you can look at, there's links, you know, so you can go ahead and check the facts for yourself.
[02:17:10.504 --> 02:17:18.141]   But there's one case on which these two judges, these high court judges, Have sat on together that I think you would be particularly interested in.
[02:17:18.161 --> 02:17:37.914]  It was a case involving the collection into a big database in the UK of UK citizens' personal information and the sharing of that information by MI5 and MI6, those two military intelligence departments, with foreign interests as well.
[02:17:38.713 --> 02:17:50.625]  And in the long opinion in which those two high court judges upheld this practice of bulk surveillance, bulk data collection and data sharing.
[02:17:50.645 --> 02:17:52.847]  We have judges with huge conflicts of interest is what you're saying?
[02:17:53.949 --> 02:17:54.649]  Yes, yes.
[02:17:55.330 --> 02:18:00.315]  Him in particular, but then again, they have upheld the surveillance state in the past.
[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:13.392]  And in the long opinion, the judges actually use the phrase, which I heard Greg Gutfeld use over 10 years ago, and I hope he's renounced it by now.
[02:18:13.892 --> 02:18:18.637]  You know when they say that in order to find the needle in the haystack, you have to have the haystack?
[02:18:19.137 --> 02:18:24.859]  That's exactly what these judges said as they were upholding the practice of bulk surveillance.
[02:18:24.919 --> 02:18:33.682]  And now they use it to manipulate elections, to persecute political opposition, to put thousands of innocent Canadians in jail for protesting.
[02:18:34.102 --> 02:18:35.322]  I mean, this is pointed at us.
[02:18:35.362 --> 02:18:36.623]  They now admit it's pointed at us.
[02:18:37.881 --> 02:18:38.481]  Yes, yes.
[02:18:38.521 --> 02:18:40.123]  And, you know, the so-called Five Eyes.
[02:18:40.483 --> 02:18:42.524]  And, you know, you saw it all last week, right?
[02:18:42.544 --> 02:18:43.745]  I think you were on break.
[02:18:44.226 --> 02:18:59.677]  But when they were going to hear about renewing the FISA 702 bulk surveillance, and then they weren't going to, you know, they were talking about the importance of the Five Eye for the integrity of our national security, etc., right?
[02:19:00.477 --> 02:19:11.919]  All of the lingo that they pull out, and it turns out that the interests that they're protecting are their own interests in retaining power over all of us.
[02:19:11.939 --> 02:19:18.060]  Absolutely, and just to be clear, just to be clear, because I love the audience, I was not off last week for three days.
[02:19:18.140 --> 02:19:23.501]  I had to deal with the bankruptcy and them trying to shut us down, and the direct deep state that's running all this.
[02:19:23.541 --> 02:19:26.021]  So I'm not trying to put myself in the same wheelhouse of Assange.
[02:19:26.041 --> 02:19:30.363]   I don't want to be in his wheelhouse, but literally they have the Justice Department On our ass.
[02:19:31.424 --> 02:19:33.646]  It's insane what's going on.
[02:19:33.666 --> 02:19:37.369]  I have to go deal with this almost on a daily basis.
[02:19:37.649 --> 02:19:40.111]  And again, where's the press' instincts?
[02:19:40.191 --> 02:19:43.794]  Even if they don't like me or like Assange, why not stand up for each other?
[02:19:43.834 --> 02:19:50.460]  Look how far the needles moved, as I said when you first came on, from Daniel Ellsberg with the secret documents that the Vietnam War was lost.
[02:19:50.820 --> 02:19:53.563]  They knew it was lost, but they wanted to make money so they kept it going.
[02:19:53.603 --> 02:19:54.504]  That was a great service.
[02:19:54.864 --> 02:19:56.745]  Well, Assange released a lot of similar info.
[02:19:57.839 --> 02:20:02.685]  So, for the press to not support him shows they've been bought off and are captured.
[02:20:02.725 --> 02:20:05.108]  I mean, look at Bezos behind the Washington Post.
[02:20:05.168 --> 02:20:05.829]  It's disgusting.
[02:20:07.557 --> 02:20:08.157]  Yes, yes.
[02:20:08.338 --> 02:20:12.000]  And I think they've been captured increasingly more and more over the years.
[02:20:12.440 --> 02:20:19.825]  Some of it potentially because Big Pharma has stepped into this cabal that is controlling the media as well.
[02:20:19.865 --> 02:20:22.927]  And there's a whole lot of funding that comes from Big Pharma.
[02:20:22.947 --> 02:20:24.808]  And of course, where does Big Pharma get the funding?
[02:20:24.888 --> 02:20:25.788]  Again, through the government.
[02:20:26.169 --> 02:20:29.611]  So there's a lot of corruption behind this.
[02:20:30.011 --> 02:20:34.774]  And again, for me, my eyes are being, you know, being more opened all the time to this.
[02:20:35.353 --> 02:20:43.780]  I lived through some of this personally through Parler's deplatforming, which I am convinced now was due to similar sorts of interests at play.
[02:20:44.260 --> 02:20:56.850]  So I think all of us right now need to take the most principled stand that we can against these authoritarian statist interests, which right now are coming after Assange.
[02:20:56.890 --> 02:20:59.192]  Again, this case should have been dropped long ago.
[02:20:59.672 --> 02:21:04.516]  Why haven't the people who are running Biden dropped this case against Assange?
[02:21:04.915 --> 02:21:09.737]  Why didn't Trump, why didn't the Trump administration drop this case against Assange?
[02:21:10.137 --> 02:21:13.279]  Why didn't Obama drop this case against Assange?
[02:21:13.359 --> 02:21:23.403]  Well that's right, you're right, Trump admitted he was basically threatened over it and again this all started in the Netherlands or wherever it was with a broken condom.
[02:21:24.984 --> 02:21:28.826]  I mean let's remember that that's how they claim this whole thing started.
[02:21:28.846 --> 02:21:30.507]  It's absolutely insane.
[02:21:32.188 --> 02:21:32.888]  Let me ask you this.
[02:21:35.699 --> 02:21:38.380]  What do you think happens if they get him here in the United States?
[02:21:38.400 --> 02:21:42.283]  I mean, he's already reportedly having serious mental issues.
[02:21:42.763 --> 02:21:45.425]  Year after year in solitary confinement would break the strongest person.
[02:21:48.147 --> 02:21:48.707]  I don't know.
[02:21:48.727 --> 02:22:02.236]  I mean, what you would hope is that if there were any court proceeding and he were allowed to appear and actually speak for himself, that he could explain to people the truth about what is going on.
[02:22:02.276 --> 02:22:10.376]   That again, This is a case of journalism versus authoritarian power, and we need to preserve the cause.
[02:22:10.688 --> 02:22:15.487]   of the First Amendment, of free speech, of journalism, against the powers that be.
[02:22:15.487 --> 02:22:19.487]   And that's an important point because Charlie Manson got interviewed in prison, it's got
[02:22:19.487 --> 02:22:20.487]  to be hundreds of times.
[02:22:20.487 --> 02:22:25.747]   I mean, I've personally seen hundreds of interviews over the last 30 years.
[02:22:25.747 --> 02:22:30.327]   How is Charlie Manson getting to do interviews, but Tucker Carlson goes to the UK, spends
[02:22:30.327 --> 02:22:34.968]   a week there, is able to meet with him briefly, but cannot get an interview.
[02:22:34.968 --> 02:22:39.167]  That right there, what changed?
[02:22:39.167 --> 02:22:45.367]   I think they are afraid that if Assange is allowed to speak for himself and people can
[02:22:45.367 --> 02:22:50.888]   actually see the principle at stake, that they would support him.
[02:22:50.829 --> 02:22:57.034]  And there are many of us who do see it anyway, even though he has not been allowed to speak for himself on camera.
[02:22:58.095 --> 02:23:00.016]  We need to speak on his behalf.
[02:23:00.456 --> 02:23:02.698]  And I think that's the best that we can do right now.
[02:23:03.599 --> 02:23:12.006]   Again, mainstream media, anyone out there who believes in the cause of journalism, To hold a check against government power?
[02:23:13.598 --> 02:23:14.939]  You need to speak out for Assange.
[02:23:14.979 --> 02:23:15.479]  Well, that's right.
[02:23:15.519 --> 02:23:19.281]  And then the entire dinosaur media is dying, being shut down.
[02:23:19.941 --> 02:23:21.401]  They gave up their power.
[02:23:21.461 --> 02:23:25.843]  They became a lapdog for corporate money and then they made themselves obsolete.
[02:23:26.324 --> 02:23:28.024]  They could really reprove themselves.
[02:23:28.064 --> 02:23:30.746]  There's any any sections other than our control.
[02:23:30.786 --> 02:23:32.526]  But I really am not going to hold my breath.
[02:23:32.947 --> 02:23:34.187]  The new media is already bigger.
[02:23:34.247 --> 02:23:35.147]  We're already dominant.
[02:23:35.508 --> 02:23:38.229]  We have to understand the old dinosaur media isn't media anymore.
[02:23:38.309 --> 02:23:40.970]  It's just a PR firm for the deep state.
[02:23:40.990 --> 02:23:42.571]  But I look at Julian Assange.
[02:23:43.151 --> 02:23:44.474]  Who again is a hero.
[02:23:44.494 --> 02:23:46.518]  I think you can't deny that.
[02:23:46.999 --> 02:23:50.045]  Exposing all these war crimes and what he's gone through.
[02:23:50.185 --> 02:23:53.713]  And I just, you know, I've never talked to Assange.
[02:23:54.571 --> 02:23:55.151]  But I know this.
[02:23:55.952 --> 02:23:58.073]  I've been approached off-record.
[02:23:58.113 --> 02:23:58.893]  It was an off-record meeting.
[02:23:58.933 --> 02:23:59.413]  I don't say it.
[02:23:59.793 --> 02:24:04.776]  One time, Henry Kissinger, head of the Rothkopf Group, head of the Kissinger Group, tried to get me to go work for him.
[02:24:04.816 --> 02:24:06.576]  He said it in front of my producers so I could tell the story.
[02:24:07.117 --> 02:24:09.097]  But I know what I've been through.
[02:24:09.137 --> 02:24:11.258]  They come and say, will you join us?
[02:24:11.318 --> 02:24:12.199]  Will you back off?
[02:24:12.239 --> 02:24:13.039]  Will you meet with us?
[02:24:13.099 --> 02:24:14.220]  In fact, we'll take care of you.
[02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:15.220]  And I've said no.
[02:24:15.580 --> 02:24:16.941]  So I know Assange.
[02:24:17.181 --> 02:24:18.442]  I don't know this, but I can know it.
[02:24:19.022 --> 02:24:20.642]  He's been approached to sell out.
[02:24:21.943 --> 02:24:24.985]  I don't know why he hasn't talked about that or maybe he hasn't.
[02:24:25.025 --> 02:24:26.786]  I missed it because he's so isolated.
[02:24:26.826 --> 02:24:28.267]  But think about the courage.
[02:24:28.327 --> 02:24:31.509]  You know, they've come to him and said, just come out and say we're wrong.
[02:24:31.529 --> 02:24:32.130]  We'll let you out.
[02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.630]  But he hasn't.
[02:24:34.731 --> 02:24:39.394]  No, and if he did, I mean, this is sounding so Orwellian to me, right?
[02:24:40.275 --> 02:24:50.314]   If you do that, then you have given up on principle and the consequences You just can't imagine what they're going to be.
[02:24:51.035 --> 02:24:53.717]  So, no, I could understand if he hasn't.
[02:24:53.797 --> 02:25:02.805]  But I understand right now that his health is at stake and that if he was transported here to the United States, his health might take a turn for the worse.
[02:25:02.845 --> 02:25:05.147]  He might not even make the trip.
[02:25:05.968 --> 02:25:10.832]  In fact, his spokesperson said that he said, if I'm taken to the United States, I will die.
[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:16.763]  And I don't know if he thinks he's going to be killed, you know, Navalny style.
[02:25:17.143 --> 02:25:20.927]  Reportedly, the CIA had considered actually just killing him.
[02:25:22.248 --> 02:25:24.790]  You know, maybe they're just counting on breaking him down.
[02:25:26.212 --> 02:25:34.597]  You know, I would hope that if he were transported to the United States, that he would be given a trial and the opportunity to speak and that people would wake up.
[02:25:34.877 --> 02:25:39.639]  But there were so many times in the past, Alex, that I thought, oh, this time people will wake up.
[02:25:39.819 --> 02:25:41.200]  Oh, this time people will wake up.
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:49.625]  I'm hoping next hour when you share some of the information that you've got about COVID and the vaccines and et cetera, that people will wake up.
[02:25:49.985 --> 02:25:53.147]  And, you know, time and again, I've been disappointed in that regard.
[02:25:53.608 --> 02:25:57.065]  But here, you know, a heroic man's life is at stake.
[02:25:58.382 --> 02:26:00.083]  He's more than paid his price.
[02:26:00.103 --> 02:26:03.264]  He needs to be freed now, and just as he would be freed now.
[02:26:04.025 --> 02:26:17.592]  And anybody, you know, who's been in office in the last while, the two main candidates running for election are complicit in siding with the authoritarian status over that principle of free expression.
[02:26:17.612 --> 02:26:19.973]  No, I totally agree, and they've convicted themselves, not him doing this.
[02:26:20.693 --> 02:26:23.855]  But gut level, I'm going to tell the CIA at MI6 something right now.
[02:26:25.313 --> 02:26:27.714]  You guys have lost all your power, all your soft power.
[02:26:27.754 --> 02:26:28.634]  The world's awake to you.
[02:26:29.175 --> 02:26:35.937]  If you just did the right thing and let Assange out, gut level, it would then become a non-story.
[02:26:36.017 --> 02:26:40.819]  And I've got a sneaking suspicion he'd do a few speeches, but he'd be so happy to be out, he would fade away.
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:42.640]  But instead, they're going to kill him.
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:45.401]  It's a very Christ-like or Martin Luther King-like deal.
[02:26:45.821 --> 02:26:47.542]  They're going to bring him here.
[02:26:47.582 --> 02:26:48.362]  They're going to kill him.
[02:26:48.703 --> 02:26:49.743]  And it'll just make him bigger.
[02:26:50.083 --> 02:26:52.024]  So they're turning him into Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[02:26:55.146 --> 02:26:57.768]  You know, I don't know if he would fade away if he were let out.
[02:26:57.828 --> 02:27:14.063]  I would hope that he would not, but I think that they realize that if they do let him go, then it is the triumph of this same principle over, you know, these authoritarian forces, these forces of corruption.
[02:27:15.123 --> 02:27:20.667]  You know, Tucker said to Putin, and Putin is an autocrat and people lionize him too much.
[02:27:21.067 --> 02:27:25.630]  I'm not saying he's not being aggressed against or the West isn't a greater, greater evil.
[02:27:26.091 --> 02:27:28.032]  But I mean, I'm not going to sit there and lionize Putin.
[02:27:28.052 --> 02:27:30.954]  But Tucker said, hey, give me that Wall Street Journal reporter.
[02:27:31.394 --> 02:27:32.175]  Show your decency.
[02:27:32.215 --> 02:27:32.836]  Let me bring him back.
[02:27:33.236 --> 02:27:34.096]  And Putin said, well.
[02:27:35.057 --> 02:27:37.158]  You know, it doesn't matter.
[02:27:37.198 --> 02:27:38.759]  We've already tried to be decent.
[02:27:39.179 --> 02:27:39.799]  It doesn't work.
[02:27:39.919 --> 02:27:42.580]  Putin should have released that reporter, and maybe he will.
[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:47.022]  But the system's got to start peace.
[02:27:47.062 --> 02:27:49.083]  They've got to start de-escalating.
[02:27:49.543 --> 02:27:52.444]  It's destroying the establishment and everybody else.
[02:27:52.804 --> 02:28:01.188]  They don't get soft power, which I've seen really, studied history and experienced it, really powerful groups know how to have soft power and back off.
[02:28:01.728 --> 02:28:03.889]  It's weakness that the establishment acts like this.
[02:28:05.942 --> 02:28:08.623]  It definitely is because basically there's two alternatives.
[02:28:09.083 --> 02:28:14.005]  You can deal with people through persuasion or you can deal with people through force.
[02:28:14.765 --> 02:28:18.846]  And what they are revealing is that they do not have arguments on their side.
[02:28:18.866 --> 02:28:27.529]  That all they have is force and they are applying it mercilessly in the face of true principles.
[02:28:27.629 --> 02:28:31.071]  Principles on which our country was founded uniquely.
[02:28:31.871 --> 02:28:35.172]  They are relinquishing it to the extent that they do not let this man free.
[02:28:36.206 --> 02:28:37.607]  Well, I've learned one thing in life.
[02:28:38.508 --> 02:28:42.412]  The world's a two-way street, and I would not want to be the establisher right now.
[02:28:42.432 --> 02:28:44.153]  I don't say this to be overconfident.
[02:28:44.173 --> 02:28:45.315]  People, I've been on there 30 years.
[02:28:45.355 --> 02:28:47.336]  For like 25, people said, man, you're so negative.
[02:28:47.757 --> 02:28:48.758]  I want people to know the truth.
[02:28:49.278 --> 02:28:54.783]  I see very positive populist signals everywhere, and I see really positive things happening.
[02:28:56.556 --> 02:28:58.698]  I read some of the CFR documents when something comes out.
[02:28:59.519 --> 02:29:12.374]  Even the establishment knows they're in deep trouble and they have to know that it's like a man that is a pretty nice guy, under stress, he's got a problem, he's been married 20 years, for whatever reason he backhands his wife and breaks her nose.
[02:29:13.427 --> 02:29:17.331]  Now if he apologizes and goes to counseling, maybe she doesn't leave him, she probably still will.
[02:29:17.771 --> 02:29:26.059]  But when she tries to leave and get in the car, if he breaks the car window out and breaks her jaw, he's going to jail and he's losing her.
[02:29:26.499 --> 02:29:27.841]  And the globalists are at that point.
[02:29:27.901 --> 02:29:35.127]  They blacked the woman's eyes, they broke her nose, and she's trying to crawl out the front door of the car, and he's literally kicking her while she's down.
[02:29:36.109 --> 02:29:37.531]  That's the analogy I use.
[02:29:38.012 --> 02:29:39.214]  That's really where we are.
[02:29:39.274 --> 02:29:39.935]  We're leaving.
[02:29:40.256 --> 02:29:43.661]  No matter what they do, no matter how this goes, it's done.
[02:29:43.882 --> 02:29:45.063]  You can see it's over.
[02:29:46.704 --> 02:29:47.345]  Yes, yes.
[02:29:47.505 --> 02:29:55.995]  And all you're getting if they keep using force to try to keep us down is they're giving us reinforcement.
[02:29:56.275 --> 02:30:06.748]  They're giving us, you know, intellectual reinforcement, moral reinforcement, even physical reinforcement, because it's making us feel right in our convictions that we need to fight this.
[02:30:07.642 --> 02:30:08.802]  There's nothing like convictions.
[02:30:09.003 --> 02:30:09.403]  All right.
[02:30:09.843 --> 02:30:12.844]  Well, we appreciate Amy Peskov for coming on with us.
[02:30:12.864 --> 02:30:15.725]  She is the Chief Policy Officer at BitChute.com.
[02:30:15.805 --> 02:30:16.346]  Great folks.
[02:30:16.366 --> 02:30:18.266]  People are like, oh, we don't need manned out video.
[02:30:18.286 --> 02:30:19.207]  We don't need BitChute.
[02:30:19.707 --> 02:30:20.908]  We don't need all those other things.
[02:30:20.948 --> 02:30:21.668]  We've got X now.
[02:30:21.948 --> 02:30:22.148]  Great.
[02:30:22.248 --> 02:30:22.768]  X is there.
[02:30:22.868 --> 02:30:23.869]  Don't think it'll be there forever.
[02:30:24.229 --> 02:30:25.369]  It's got a lot of stuff behind the scenes.
[02:30:25.389 --> 02:30:29.991]  We need to back BitChute and back Gab and everybody else.
[02:30:30.051 --> 02:30:31.492]  Amy, thank you so much and God bless you.
[02:30:32.867 --> 02:30:33.467]  Thank you.
[02:30:33.707 --> 02:30:36.108]  And maybe we'll talk about 702 again someday, huh?
[02:30:36.389 --> 02:30:37.509]  Come back on, please.
[02:30:38.189 --> 02:30:38.650]  Definitely.
[02:30:39.170 --> 02:30:39.490]  All right.
[02:30:41.171 --> 02:30:42.331]  Jesus Christ, man.
[02:30:42.371 --> 02:30:43.112]  You just see this?
[02:30:43.912 --> 02:30:45.633]  I don't want to fight with a globalist.
[02:30:45.873 --> 02:30:46.893]  It's like that Who song.
[02:30:47.354 --> 02:30:48.554]  And we'll come back next hour with it.
[02:30:48.574 --> 02:30:50.875]  I forget the name of the song.
[02:30:51.015 --> 02:30:52.516]  I don't need to fight to prove I'm right.
[02:30:53.156 --> 02:30:54.016]  I can fight you.
[02:30:55.057 --> 02:30:56.197]  And I'll probably win that.
[02:30:56.258 --> 02:30:59.339]  But I don't even want to hurt you, globalist.
[02:31:01.348 --> 02:31:03.830]  It's like, I don't need to prove this.
[02:31:04.370 --> 02:31:05.651]  You're going to make me do it though.
[02:31:05.971 --> 02:31:06.551]  I understand that.
[02:31:07.172 --> 02:31:07.672]  I understand it.
[02:31:08.672 --> 02:31:14.075]  And if you want to make yourselves worthless and make me worthless in the process, then dammit, we'll do it.
[02:31:14.796 --> 02:31:18.598]  But I'll promise you, we've identified and lazed your ass.
[02:31:18.638 --> 02:31:21.519]  We've lit you up like a spotlight on cockroaches.
[02:31:21.860 --> 02:31:24.481]  When you turn the light on at 2 a.m., you didn't know you had cockroaches.
[02:31:24.821 --> 02:31:27.483]  You left a piece of cake out and there's 50 cockroaches eating it.
[02:31:28.843 --> 02:31:30.104]  Folks, you're spotlighted.
[02:31:30.124 --> 02:31:32.126]  It's like the FBI when there's a hostage situation.
[02:31:32.426 --> 02:31:32.866]  Come out.
[02:31:33.066 --> 02:31:34.147]  You only get 20 years.
[02:31:34.207 --> 02:31:35.188]  Don't kill the hostages.
[02:31:35.728 --> 02:31:37.890]  You're gonna get the electric chair.
[02:31:37.930 --> 02:31:38.690]  We're gonna kill you.
[02:31:39.011 --> 02:31:39.731]  Come out now.
[02:31:40.091 --> 02:31:41.673]  There's no hope but coming out now.
[02:31:42.193 --> 02:31:49.498]  I mean, I'm like literally to the New World Order like, guys, like, you're not getting out of this.
[02:31:50.679 --> 02:31:54.502]  You're not getting away with it, Larry Fink.
[02:31:54.902 --> 02:31:57.404]  He all thinks he's insulated from all the crimes he commits.
[02:31:58.476 --> 02:32:00.057]  You're not insulated from anything, buddy boy.
[02:32:00.977 --> 02:32:01.297]  All right.
[02:32:02.237 --> 02:32:05.178]  I've got this huge cup of news and some military news.
[02:32:05.259 --> 02:32:05.679]  It's huge.
[02:32:07.079 --> 02:32:07.659]  We'll hit that.
[02:32:08.480 --> 02:32:09.760]  Then Maria Z will take over.
[02:32:10.580 --> 02:32:13.141]  Please remember, I don't have globalist funding.
[02:32:13.261 --> 02:32:13.882]  I have you.
[02:32:14.322 --> 02:32:15.082]  I'm in your hands.
[02:32:15.122 --> 02:32:15.902]  You're in my hands.

[02:33:05.490 --> 02:33:06.711]  They said like 87%.
[02:33:07.651 --> 02:33:09.632]  Most companies put out raw turmeric.
[02:33:09.893 --> 02:33:10.113]  It's 5%, 4%.
[02:33:10.713 --> 02:33:13.374]  This is 95% curcuminoid.
[02:33:13.955 --> 02:33:14.255]  Okay.
[02:33:14.495 --> 02:33:23.622]   So this is like, I guess the example is like, instead of eating, you have to eat like 10 of those other pills just to get what is in one of these.
[02:33:24.542 --> 02:33:29.784]  And it's got some other key ingredients in it that the experts say helps upload the turmeric.
[02:33:29.824 --> 02:33:30.984]  It's anti-inflammatory.

[02:34:05.532 --> 02:34:08.273]  And this is selling out, but despite that, it's still 30% off.
[02:34:08.714 --> 02:34:15.538]  It's next level foundational energy, the methylfolate, the key compound of other ingredients that clean out your cells and that are the main energy source.
[02:34:15.918 --> 02:34:16.959]  Popeye takes spinach.
[02:34:17.279 --> 02:34:18.179]  That's why it's so strong.
[02:34:18.239 --> 02:34:18.759]  What's in that?
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:19.540]  Folic acid.
[02:34:19.740 --> 02:34:24.521]  This is the breakdown concentrate of folic acid after the cells break it down.
[02:34:24.801 --> 02:34:30.083]  So this just goes right in there like nitrous oxide in a race car, okay?
[02:34:30.103 --> 02:34:34.184]  So you go from 800 horsepower to 1,500 horsepower when you turn on the nitrous.
[02:34:35.665 --> 02:34:37.705]  I can't even take this, okay?
[02:34:38.065 --> 02:34:40.126]  Okay, I turn into a psychotic goblin.
[02:34:40.626 --> 02:34:42.147]  Okay, I'm just telling you right now.
[02:34:42.647 --> 02:34:44.307]  You want next-level financial energy?
[02:34:44.347 --> 02:34:44.627]  Get it.
[02:34:44.947 --> 02:34:46.548]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:34:47.288 --> 02:34:48.529]  Alright, I'm doing a few segments.
[02:34:48.549 --> 02:34:50.130]  Maria Z from Australia is taking over.
[02:34:50.170 --> 02:34:50.910]  Big developments there.
[02:34:50.930 --> 02:34:54.372]  Let's talk about Ukraine.
[02:34:55.332 --> 02:34:56.513]  Both sides have got beefs.
[02:34:58.154 --> 02:34:59.834]  Slavs have been fighting for a thousand years.
[02:35:00.415 --> 02:35:03.716]  In between fighting the Huns and the Muslims.
[02:35:05.497 --> 02:35:08.399]  But the West did start this fight nine years ago and bragged about it.
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:16.443]  And people like Soros just last year said, oh, I'm the czar of Russia, just to inflame the Russians.
[02:35:17.833 --> 02:35:20.714]  And now the Russians just wanted a third of Ukraine.
[02:35:20.734 --> 02:35:21.935]  They always said that was the mission.
[02:35:24.436 --> 02:35:25.496]  And now they've gone and they've taken it.
[02:35:27.877 --> 02:35:30.999]  And the media, the controlled corporate media, the enemy of the people, it's gone.
[02:35:31.839 --> 02:35:34.580]  The same media is saying we need open borders and fentanyl is great and everything.
[02:35:35.081 --> 02:35:42.424]  They've gone from saying, oh, Ukraine's invincible, to I've got the Washington Post, the New York Times, they're all right here, saying they've lost, they're losing everything.
[02:35:43.224 --> 02:35:44.745]  They're collapsing right now.
[02:35:45.145 --> 02:35:46.926]  And the Russians aren't even really pushing.
[02:35:47.756 --> 02:35:51.517]  They're just kicking them out and getting a few miles in the few cities they want.
[02:35:51.537 --> 02:35:53.818]  You're like, oh, well, great.
[02:35:53.838 --> 02:35:54.598]  This war will be over.
[02:35:54.838 --> 02:35:55.598]  No, sir.
[02:35:57.178 --> 02:35:58.819]  The globalists have said we're not giving up.
[02:36:00.219 --> 02:36:02.440]  They put this intelligence chief in charge of things.
[02:36:02.460 --> 02:36:03.460]  They're going to go to terrorism.
[02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:12.983]  We said that with Jack Possum two weeks ago, and now they're sending in drones to bomb Russian cities and civilians to piss the Russians off.
[02:36:13.363 --> 02:36:14.663]  What a great idea.
[02:36:16.530 --> 02:36:18.451]  Let's go start a fight with people that have nuclear weapons.
[02:36:21.033 --> 02:36:28.117]  Because BlackRock and the bankers all feel insulated up at their big high-rises, and, oh, the military will take the blame, the politicians will take the blame.
[02:36:28.458 --> 02:36:37.503]  No, Klaus Schwab, all of you guys, like Bill Gates and Larry Fink, are going to take the blame.
[02:36:39.145 --> 02:36:40.305]  We all know who's doing this.
[02:36:42.407 --> 02:36:48.645]   If the Russians were in our business, which they're not, compared to anybody else, I'd be all over their ass like stink on you-know-what.
[02:36:49.686 --> 02:36:51.668]  Like white on rice, like flies on shit.
[02:36:52.209 --> 02:36:52.609]  They're not.
[02:36:55.673 --> 02:37:00.619]  And the globalists have run off the Chinese they controlled, who are super evil, the leadership of it.
[02:37:01.854 --> 02:37:02.674]  They've broken with them.
[02:37:03.535 --> 02:37:07.577]  Everything the globalists are doing, the American power we had, is being run on the ground.
[02:37:07.597 --> 02:37:10.058]  And I'll be honest, I want the dollar to remain the world currency.
[02:37:10.458 --> 02:37:11.699]  Hell, that's the only thing we got left.
[02:37:11.779 --> 02:37:20.183]  I mean, I'm not trying to, like, shut American power down, but I want to see American power produce freedom and justice so everybody wants to be with us.
[02:37:20.563 --> 02:37:24.325]  Instead, I'm watching people destroy everything that makes us strong.
[02:37:26.707 --> 02:37:29.308]  And if you look at them on average, they're a bunch of dumbass lawyers.
[02:37:29.968 --> 02:37:32.709]  God, these lawyers, like Joe Biden.
[02:37:36.270 --> 02:37:38.651]  He's got a lot of nerve with all his race-pushing stuff, man.
[02:37:39.191 --> 02:37:42.552]  God, calling black people super predators, gotta keep them on a leash, all that stuff.
[02:37:43.512 --> 02:37:47.733]  He got the law passed, if a black man's caught with cocaine, he gets three times the president's sentence if a white man.
[02:37:48.293 --> 02:37:49.714]  That's real racism, folks.
[02:37:51.510 --> 02:37:58.937]  The black man's using cocaine, that's his problem, and I wish he wasn't doing it, just like a white man, but you sure as hell don't throw him in jail for 30 years.
[02:37:59.798 --> 02:38:00.738]  So here's the headlines.
[02:38:01.519 --> 02:38:04.262]  Ukraine growing weaker by the day, says Elon Musk.
[02:38:04.882 --> 02:38:07.344]  Congress leaves Ukraine aid bill in limbo.
[02:38:08.586 --> 02:38:10.667]  Canada pledges hundreds of drones to Ukraine.
[02:38:10.727 --> 02:38:11.048]  Okay.
[02:38:12.344 --> 02:38:13.505]  Iran just pledged thousands.
[02:38:13.545 --> 02:38:15.927]  Hillary says Trump will turn U.S.
[02:38:15.948 --> 02:38:16.848]  military against Americans.
[02:38:17.769 --> 02:38:20.632]  Big article in the Washington Post where they admit Putin's winning on every front.
[02:38:21.172 --> 02:38:23.855]  Their answer is double and triple down.
[02:38:24.215 --> 02:38:27.478]  Major victory for Russian army as Ukraine forces flee eastern city.
[02:38:29.440 --> 02:38:31.843]  It's on like Donkey Kong.
[02:38:32.403 --> 02:38:33.904]  What are the globalists going to pull now?
[02:38:35.071 --> 02:38:38.734]  All right, final segment I'm doing and then Maria Z takes over the rest of the hour.
[02:38:38.754 --> 02:38:39.715]  The Don't Shore at 3 p.m.
[02:38:39.735 --> 02:38:41.677]  Central in about 53 minutes, 44 minutes.
[02:38:43.524 --> 02:38:46.145]  All right, so you see this big-ass stack right here.
[02:38:46.625 --> 02:38:53.487]  This is FDA reports, CDC reports, major institutions admitting mass blood clots, mass deaths, 20 million dead.
[02:38:53.507 --> 02:38:55.868]  Could have done the whole show on this, folks.
[02:38:56.328 --> 02:38:56.929]  They did it.
[02:38:57.109 --> 02:38:57.589]  It's real.
[02:38:58.029 --> 02:39:04.191]  The shots are killing people en masse, erasing our immune systems, creating weird hydrogel interfacial computers.
[02:39:04.351 --> 02:39:05.711]  It's all confirmed.
[02:39:06.072 --> 02:39:10.193]  That Greg Reeves report today is incredibly important.
[02:39:11.365 --> 02:39:11.625]  Wow!
[02:39:12.425 --> 02:39:13.846]  Everybody needs to get it and share it.
[02:39:14.286 --> 02:39:17.707]  Evidence shows biological ID system has already been deployed.
[02:39:20.268 --> 02:39:23.669]  Evidence shows biological ID system has already been deployed.
[02:39:24.170 --> 02:39:25.490]  We're living in the twilight zone.
[02:39:25.550 --> 02:39:28.131]  So, here's the big news.
[02:39:28.471 --> 02:39:38.195]  A couple days ago, we started seeing people put up red cross postings saying, did you take the COVID shot?
[02:39:38.255 --> 02:39:39.075]  Did you have COVID?
[02:39:40.615 --> 02:39:42.976]  And then we ferreted through it, we're writing articles about it right now.
[02:39:43.456 --> 02:39:50.479]  When you call them or you talk to them, they want to know that because that blood's being separated out from the main blood supply.
[02:39:50.519 --> 02:39:51.720]  So they're basically rejecting it.
[02:39:54.810 --> 02:39:55.991]  We said this three years ago.
[02:39:56.111 --> 02:39:57.532]  What are they going to do?
[02:39:57.572 --> 02:40:01.555]  People will pay for unvaccinated sperm or whatever, or a woman hadn't been vaccinated.
[02:40:01.935 --> 02:40:04.857]  Well, don't worry, we're all getting it to one level because it sheds.
[02:40:05.578 --> 02:40:07.639]  That's been admitted for three and a half years.
[02:40:08.500 --> 02:40:09.381]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[02:40:09.961 --> 02:40:11.002]  But first, this report.
[02:40:11.022 --> 02:40:12.763]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:40:12.823 --> 02:40:13.944]  It deserves to get out.
[02:40:14.544 --> 02:40:15.145]  You want to win?
[02:40:15.165 --> 02:40:15.605]  Get it out.
[02:40:15.625 --> 02:40:16.546]  You want to roll over and die?
[02:40:16.586 --> 02:40:16.826]  Don't.
[02:40:18.067 --> 02:40:18.427]  Watch.
[02:40:18.567 --> 02:40:29.079]   Top FDA official admits didn't do enough, good enough job, Top FDA official admits didn't do a good enough job informing Americans about COVID-19 vaccine deaths.
[02:40:29.580 --> 02:40:32.863]  So now they're walking it back going, oh, there's some deaths, but it's really rare.
[02:40:33.023 --> 02:40:34.305]  Yeah, 20 million deaths, it's real rare.
[02:40:36.024 --> 02:40:54.478]  Last week during a House Oversight Committee, we just heard about today, on improving vaccine injury and composition system, FDA Director at the Center of the Biological Evaluation and Research, Dr. Peter Marks, admitted the FDA probably have not done a good enough job, this is a quote, at keeping Americans informed about vaccine-induced deaths.
[02:40:55.390 --> 02:41:08.518]  Why'd the FDA in October of 2000, three months before the shot rolled out in the U.S., say we predict blood clots, myocarditis, heart attacks, strokes, infertility, cancer?
[02:41:09.279 --> 02:41:11.540]  Because they'd already tested it in mice, folks.
[02:41:13.121 --> 02:41:18.724]  Now, I told you that four years ago in February of 2020 with the guy that authored the U.S.
[02:41:18.765 --> 02:41:20.806]  Biological and Chemical Weapons Law.
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:24.201]  And former top UN prosecutor.
[02:41:24.641 --> 02:41:26.482]  He knows everything.
[02:41:26.522 --> 02:41:29.123]  He's got the special Harvard Kissinger PhD.
[02:41:29.303 --> 02:41:30.143]  They give one out a year.
[02:41:30.804 --> 02:41:34.785]  He told you everything without telling you it was classified information.
[02:41:34.805 --> 02:41:35.906]  You said, oh, I just think this.
[02:41:37.286 --> 02:41:39.627]  And now we're sitting here watching this happen.
[02:41:40.148 --> 02:41:48.111]  So here is Dr. Peter Marks, former top or current former FDA official, top official admitting it.
[02:41:50.052 --> 02:42:09.303]   We spoke over the phone back on August 10th of 2021 and I was asking about VAERS because I had Lots of constituents reaching out to me saying there was tons of adverse effects, there was thousands of deaths, et cetera, and they were very concerned.
[02:42:09.783 --> 02:42:11.824]  And I asked, how many were confirmed?
[02:42:12.284 --> 02:42:14.364]  And at that time, you said four.
[02:42:14.484 --> 02:42:20.445]  There were four cases that you confirmed deaths of that were caused by the vaccine.
[02:42:21.065 --> 02:42:33.752]   And I suggested at the time that the CDC and FDA do a better job of telling the public Not just how many cases were reported, but how many were actually confirmed.
[02:42:34.493 --> 02:42:44.383]  And just, if I heard you right, just recently you said, well, we don't want to give out too much information because of privacy rights.
[02:42:44.503 --> 02:42:50.189]  But certainly we could put out how many were confirmed deaths, couldn't we?
[02:42:51.664 --> 02:42:53.645]  Congresswoman, thank you so much for that question.
[02:42:53.805 --> 02:43:03.407]  I fully agree with you that we probably have not done a good enough job of communicating sometimes the actual numbers of deaths versus what's in VAERS.
[02:43:03.447 --> 02:43:05.988]  In fact, we just nearly fell prey to it here at this hearing.
[02:43:06.348 --> 02:43:12.950]  There are only handfuls, and I'll ask Dr. Jernigan to comment on this as well, handfuls that we can actually associate.
[02:43:13.490 --> 02:43:15.251]  Can I ask why you haven't done it?
[02:43:15.331 --> 02:43:16.571]  I mean, this was August of 2021.
[02:43:16.831 --> 02:43:38.501]  It seems very logical to me that if you're saying people, the public, shouldn't count on theirs because anybody can report to that, which they can, why wouldn't you as actively report to the public, well, we confirmed this really low number of cases that actually were caused by vaccines.
[02:43:38.541 --> 02:43:40.282]  I mean, it's been years now.
[02:43:40.462 --> 02:43:41.382]  Why haven't you done it?
[02:43:41.502 --> 02:43:47.527]  We did present that in various settings, including at, I believe, at the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices.
[02:43:47.607 --> 02:43:51.030]  It was mentioned at our Vaccine Advisory Committee.
[02:43:52.191 --> 02:43:53.973]  It perhaps did not go as broadly.
[02:43:54.293 --> 02:43:57.476]  Is there an easy place for the public to find this?
[02:43:57.556 --> 02:44:04.101]  I remember you gave us some kind of link back in 2021, but it was really difficult to get to, if I remember right.
[02:44:04.542 --> 02:44:07.344]  And so why not spend the time, like, making...
[02:44:08.405 --> 02:44:26.818]  If the goal is to give confidence to people in getting vaccines, why in the world would you just not say, okay, what we have done is we've investigated these deaths, we've done this, we've done that, and we've only found, you know, a handful.
[02:44:26.898 --> 02:44:28.599]  I mean, it doesn't make any sense to me.
[02:44:30.771 --> 02:44:33.092]  So what's happened is, they've been caught in the limetimes.
[02:44:33.112 --> 02:44:35.053]  They're trying to say, oh, it's very rare, which it's not.
[02:44:35.273 --> 02:44:35.773]  20 million dead.
[02:44:36.173 --> 02:44:37.334]  Insurance company numbers.
[02:44:37.594 --> 02:44:38.714]  Can't beat those numbers.
[02:44:38.974 --> 02:44:39.714]  Best numbers out there.
[02:44:41.795 --> 02:44:44.616]  So he's like, oh, we could have done a better job telling you it's really rare.
[02:44:46.117 --> 02:44:47.237]  The whole thing's experimental.
[02:44:47.277 --> 02:44:48.218]  The whole thing's a lie.
[02:44:48.238 --> 02:44:49.798]  There's all these new blood clots.
[02:44:49.858 --> 02:44:50.559]  We all know the truth.
[02:44:52.539 --> 02:44:56.361]  So they're rearranging deck chairs right now on the Titanic.
[02:44:57.759 --> 02:44:59.020]  That's all these criminals are doing.
[02:44:59.180 --> 02:45:06.726]  Because they got away with so much murder, and so many secret tests, and so much corruption before, and they just plan to bum rush us down and have us give up.
[02:45:06.786 --> 02:45:07.367]  It's not happening.
[02:45:09.368 --> 02:45:13.172]  But the big takeaway here is, is that Congress is now talking about this.
[02:45:14.653 --> 02:45:16.254]  And there's no putting the genie back in the bottle.
[02:45:16.935 --> 02:45:18.296]  Alright, overhead shot please.
[02:45:20.798 --> 02:45:26.943]  Folks all over Twitter, all over X, have been talking about this.
[02:45:28.960 --> 02:45:35.061]  Last week saying people are posting saying I went to get blood and the Red Cross asked me, have you had COVID?
[02:45:35.101 --> 02:45:37.382]  Have you had the COVID vaccine?
[02:45:40.123 --> 02:45:50.945]  And sure enough, they're now trying to find out who's had the blood and who hasn't to decide when to where to send blood that has had it and hasn't had it showing that the establishment doesn't want to take blood.
[02:45:51.957 --> 02:45:59.745]  That is creating these giant clots and has all this garbage added to it, which we predicted they would indeed do.
[02:45:59.765 --> 02:46:01.907]  So here's the Red Cross document.
[02:46:02.647 --> 02:46:04.729]  Our printer sometimes malfunctions and prints stuff yellow.
[02:46:04.749 --> 02:46:05.350]  Let's watch yellow.
[02:46:05.830 --> 02:46:06.531]  Rapid pass.
[02:46:07.092 --> 02:46:08.013]  Q79.
[02:46:08.513 --> 02:46:11.816]  Have you ever had a coronavirus COVID-19 vaccine?
[02:46:12.157 --> 02:46:12.937]  Yes, no, skip.
[02:46:13.760 --> 02:46:14.641]  The answer is yes.
[02:46:14.701 --> 02:46:21.386]  The question, please call 1-800-RED-CROSS before coming to donate to determine if this will affect your eligibility.
[02:46:22.027 --> 02:46:27.411]  So they're saying if you've had the vaccine, it affects your eligibility.
[02:46:27.451 --> 02:46:28.152]  So there's the headline.
[02:46:29.393 --> 02:46:41.603]  Red Cross tells blood donors you may be prohibited from giving blood if you've had the shot.
[02:46:45.942 --> 02:46:53.488]  Red Cross tells people, vaccinated for COVID-19, you may be ineligible to get blood.
[02:46:54.089 --> 02:46:59.053]  Red Cross tells blood donors, if you've been COVID-19 vaccinated, they may refuse your blood.
[02:46:59.633 --> 02:47:00.314]  That's the headline.
[02:47:00.834 --> 02:47:04.117]  Think about how massive that information is.
[02:47:04.157 --> 02:47:06.099]  People for a week, like, speculated.
[02:47:06.119 --> 02:47:09.842]  We just went ahead and checked it out and called the Red Cross and checked the links.
[02:47:09.882 --> 02:47:11.183]  Yeah, it's the Red Cross.
[02:47:11.223 --> 02:47:11.944]  This is official.
[02:47:14.818 --> 02:47:18.699]  So, think for a minute how big that is.
[02:47:18.779 --> 02:47:25.842]  And imagine if this show wasn't on air, or other shows like it, where we'd be.
[02:47:26.162 --> 02:47:33.070]   But because we're still on air, which is a miracle thanks to all of you, God working through you, we're still here.

[02:50:44.012 --> 02:50:54.282]  Alright, Maria Z from the Pacific Ocean in the great country of Australia, the front line of the fight against tyranny, takes over now.
[02:50:56.590 --> 02:50:58.011]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:50:58.211 --> 02:51:00.452]  I'm Maria Zee of ZeeMedia.com.
[02:51:00.472 --> 02:51:07.297]  Such an honour to be with you in this historic, historic week for the future of media.
[02:51:07.357 --> 02:51:22.425]   Julian Assange, as you all heard earlier in the broadcast, is facing possibly his last chance to escape extradition to the United States, where many agree if they extradite him, He may die.
[02:51:22.485 --> 02:51:27.787]  His life is in danger and the future of free press is in danger.
[02:51:27.867 --> 02:51:34.689]  We have his father with us, joining us live right now from the UK, where he is at his son's hearing.
[02:51:34.769 --> 02:51:38.369]  John Shipton, thank you so much for joining us and thank you for your patience this morning.
[02:51:38.650 --> 02:51:40.010]  We really appreciate your time.
[02:51:40.030 --> 02:51:42.751]  Hi, Maria.
[02:51:42.951 --> 02:51:44.271]  Hi, how are you doing?
[02:51:45.623 --> 02:51:46.843]  Doing very well, John.
[02:51:47.284 --> 02:51:51.145]  I've been getting, you know, looking at all of the people that are reporting.
[02:51:51.165 --> 02:51:53.646]  There is one particular reporter who has been in the courtroom.
[02:51:54.326 --> 02:52:15.756]   It looks like there are being, you know, just today there have been pleas For Julian to, I believe it's Article 4, they're pleading under Article 4 because this is politically motivated and trying to put a stop to this extradition.
[02:52:15.956 --> 02:52:21.076]   If you can move a little bit away from the camera, John, and give us an update as to where this is at.
[02:52:21.076 --> 02:52:35.236]   Okay, so Article 4 refers to the article in the United States and UK Exhibition Treaty.
[02:52:35.426 --> 02:52:38.847]  Are you able to move a little bit further away, John, so that we can see you?
[02:52:40.027 --> 02:52:40.587]  There we go.
[02:52:41.028 --> 02:52:48.270]  I have two images in the camera.
[02:52:49.150 --> 02:52:49.630]  It's weird.
[02:52:49.810 --> 02:52:51.011]  I have one image.
[02:52:51.571 --> 02:52:52.211]  Oh, there we go.
[02:52:52.251 --> 02:52:53.051]  We can see you.
[02:52:53.151 --> 02:52:54.632]  We can see you better now.
[02:52:56.349 --> 02:52:59.053]  Because I have two images anyway.
[02:52:59.073 --> 02:53:02.318]  It's ridiculous.
[02:53:02.538 --> 02:53:02.858]  Article 4.
[02:53:05.818 --> 02:53:21.861]  Article 4 refers to the article in the United States UK extradition treaty which goes to say that you cannot extradite for political reasons.
[02:53:22.161 --> 02:53:24.661]  So that was what the argument today was about.
[02:53:25.802 --> 02:53:48.520]   The argument continued that espionage It's a political charge and then the argument continued that the leaks are essentially political in nature.
[02:53:51.619 --> 02:53:54.740]  That covered really most of the day's hearing.
[02:53:55.080 --> 02:54:13.465]  A little bit further on the barrister went to say that the United States can't privilege itself by choosing one part of the Exhibition Treaty, that is the Julian can be exercised, and leaving out the other part of the Exhibition Treaty, in particular Article 4.
[02:54:13.705 --> 02:54:18.927]  That was most of the day really.
[02:54:20.743 --> 02:54:23.829]  It's really important, and I'm asking you about specifics, John.
[02:54:24.551 --> 02:54:29.600]  Again, if you can just move the camera away a little bit so that the viewers can see you properly.
[02:54:29.620 --> 02:54:32.266]  I'm asking you these specifics because...
[02:54:33.303 --> 02:54:42.090]  A lot of people don't actually understand, you know, what the case of Julian, the details of the case of Julian.
[02:54:42.131 --> 02:54:49.177]  I just went and watched a fantastic documentary, The Trust Fall, which I'll play a snippet for the viewers a little bit later.
[02:54:51.795 --> 02:54:57.200]  The absolute mistreatment of Julian Assange, who is a hero.
[02:54:57.220 --> 02:54:58.902]  The U.S.
[02:54:58.942 --> 02:55:01.244]  prosecutors are saying that he helped U.S.
[02:55:01.364 --> 02:55:07.309]  Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning steal diplomatic cables and military files.
[02:55:07.630 --> 02:55:08.751]  That is not the truth.
[02:55:09.431 --> 02:55:13.635]  A publisher is entitled to publish what they've been given.
[02:55:14.235 --> 02:55:32.991]  Julian went to extreme, extreme care every single time he published anything to make sure that names were redacted and, you know, I mean, this is extraordinary, extraordinary measures that are being used to silence, in my opinion, the best journalist in history.
[02:55:34.786 --> 02:55:40.011]  Maria, essentially what you say is absolutely correct.
[02:55:40.692 --> 02:55:48.338]  Except, well not adding to, adding to what you say is that the entire case is political.
[02:55:48.838 --> 02:55:50.680]  It's a political persecution.
[02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:52.922]  There are no laws involved.
[02:55:53.442 --> 02:55:59.788]  The laws are being used to fulfill an extradition to the United States.
[02:56:00.632 --> 02:56:06.356]  A publisher and a journalist that the United States has taken exception to.
[02:56:07.277 --> 02:56:38.274]   The public interest in the publications of Julian Assange, in the cables for example, the diplomatic cables, there's 250,000 of them, demonstrate to all people who are interested that the United States method of diplomatic cajoling or diplomatic coercion or diplomatic bribery.
[02:56:39.294 --> 02:57:22.223]   So, you know, all most people in the world can get some benefit from it, particularly Americans, because you get to understand how the State Department uses the tools of power and the tools of money And the tools of assassination to ensure that they, the leaders of countries that, sorry, to ensure that those people who lead the countries that America is concerned with are the people that America wants.
[02:57:23.204 --> 02:57:41.802]   And in particular, it outlines The Iraq War files outlines 15,000 unreported deaths of citizens during the United States invasion of Iraq.
[02:57:44.083 --> 02:57:47.304]  No one has been put on trial for the war crimes, John.
[02:57:47.364 --> 02:57:51.806]  No one's been put on trial for the war crimes and yet Julian is still in prison.
[02:57:53.287 --> 02:57:59.098]   Yes, but there are two Lots of benefits, okay?
[02:57:59.898 --> 02:58:02.681]  One is that you know who the criminals are.
[02:58:03.442 --> 02:58:09.687]  Two is you know their methods, how they instituted their criminality.
[02:58:09.727 --> 02:58:11.769]  For example, the destruction of the road.
[02:58:12.370 --> 02:58:21.358]  The third one is the willingness of governments to pursue the criminals that are so exposed.
[02:58:21.978 --> 02:58:31.274]   What I don't really expect The United States to arrest Pompeo and put him on trial.
[02:58:31.754 --> 02:58:36.680]  But what does happen is that people can do something about it themselves.
[02:58:37.240 --> 02:59:04.812]   In the case of Iraq, one of the cables that was released Ensured that the Iraqi Parliament was able to ask the United States to withdraw all its troops and by refusing to sign the Status of Forces Agreement that would exist between Iraq and the United States and its allies.
[02:59:05.613 --> 02:59:10.035]  Consequently, the United States removed its troops.
[02:59:10.415 --> 02:59:27.007]   So you could say that Releasing information for publishers like yourself and Alex to publish can stop a war, or can bring a war to an end, or can stop a war happening.
[02:59:27.387 --> 02:59:28.227]  It's marvellous.
[02:59:29.804 --> 02:59:31.005]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:59:31.245 --> 02:59:33.367]  And they want to stop that power.
[02:59:33.407 --> 02:59:35.928]  They want to limit free speech.
[02:59:36.609 --> 02:59:41.873]  But when people hear limit free speech, they don't understand how far these people will take it.
[02:59:41.913 --> 02:59:49.218]  Julian Assange, there's a saying that we are all Julian Assange and that is in no way, shape or form downplaying what Julian has been through.
[02:59:49.258 --> 02:59:53.361]  He's been tormented by these people trying to break his spirit.
[02:59:54.162 --> 03:00:01.710]  But it is in the sense that he is the example for the world, the true example.
[03:00:01.770 --> 03:00:07.250]  I note that he refused to give up his sources.
[03:00:07.250 --> 03:00:14.010]   Just the true example of journalism and free speech and how far they will go to silence
[03:00:14.010 --> 03:00:15.010]  it.
[03:00:15.010 --> 03:00:18.488]   John, I know that you have a short time but if you will please stay with us after this
[03:00:18.488 --> 03:00:19.488]  short break.
[03:00:19.488 --> 03:00:23.129]  I want to ask you about what's just happened in Bologna.
[03:00:23.129 --> 03:00:27.770]  They've voted to confer honorary citizenship to Julian Assange.
[03:00:27.770 --> 03:00:30.370]  What this could mean and what we will expect tomorrow.
[03:00:30.370 --> 03:00:32.050]  So please stay with us.
[03:00:32.050 --> 03:00:37.770]   We'll be back after this very short break and then I will close up the segment because
[03:00:37.770 --> 03:00:39.010]  I know that you need to go.
[03:00:39.587 --> 03:00:40.587]  We'll be back in a moment.
[03:00:41.047 --> 03:00:41.488]  Okay.
[03:00:41.788 --> 03:00:45.329]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[03:00:45.709 --> 03:00:52.731]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[03:00:52.912 --> 03:00:54.912]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[03:00:55.092 --> 03:00:56.133]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[03:00:56.213 --> 03:00:56.873]  He loved the idea.
[03:00:57.213 --> 03:01:00.737]  What would you call the debates and discussions about a pro-human future?
[03:01:00.757 --> 03:01:01.638]  Just Team Humanity?
[03:01:01.698 --> 03:01:02.578]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[03:01:02.739 --> 03:01:03.179]  Absolutely.
[03:01:03.499 --> 03:01:04.881]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[03:01:04.961 --> 03:01:08.384]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[03:01:08.625 --> 03:01:16.072]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[03:01:16.312 --> 03:01:28.063]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[03:01:28.344 --> 03:01:29.665]  We're told humans are the problem.
[03:01:29.685 --> 03:01:30.686]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[03:01:30.946 --> 03:01:35.230]  We're told all this garbage, so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[03:01:35.530 --> 03:01:36.231]  We're not going to do that.
[03:01:36.491 --> 03:01:41.116]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at mfulmorestore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[03:01:41.716 --> 03:02:02.986]  All right, we're here with one more segment with John Shipton, Julian Assange's father, joining us live from the UK, where Assange is facing possibly his final chance at escaping extradition to the United States, which will be, I mean, almost certainly the end of his freedom and the end of the freedom of the press.
[03:02:03.006 --> 03:02:12.668]   This is such a monumental week in history, not just for Julian Assange, not just for his family, who have also suffered greatly alongside this hero,
[03:02:12.668 --> 03:02:18.668]   but also every single person who dares to tell the truth in today's day and age.
[03:02:18.668 --> 03:02:21.668]  John, I want to ask you about this news coming out of Bologna.
[03:02:21.668 --> 03:02:25.668]  Bologna will confer honorary citizenship to Julian Assange.
[03:02:25.668 --> 03:02:30.668]   What do you know about this and what could this possibly mean for his case?
[03:02:30.668 --> 03:02:33.668]  It's marvellous.
[03:02:33.668 --> 03:02:39.668]   There's Naples, which has already conferred honorary citizenship,
[03:02:39.668 --> 03:02:44.668]  and there's Bologna, and last week there was Rome.
[03:02:44.712 --> 03:02:51.156]  So those three great Italian cities have conferred honorary citizenship.
[03:02:51.576 --> 03:03:18.074]   I thought when I go home, you and I might go down and see the Honourable Councillors of the Melbourne City Council and suggest that they get in the queue and follow the good example of Rome and Naples and make Julian an honorary citizen.
[03:03:18.514 --> 03:03:19.134]  What do you think?
[03:03:19.174 --> 03:03:25.498]   John, I would be honoured And we'll absolutely do that with you.
[03:03:25.719 --> 03:03:31.064]  Anything that we can do to help Julian's case and help the family, I will be there.
[03:03:31.204 --> 03:03:35.970]  We will speak after we finish this broadcast and I'll organise that with you.
[03:03:35.990 --> 03:03:36.790]  You have my word.
[03:03:38.813 --> 03:03:39.213]  Thank you.
[03:03:39.593 --> 03:03:39.954]  Thank you.
[03:03:39.974 --> 03:03:40.775]  It'll be great fun.
[03:03:43.256 --> 03:03:57.249]  Well, I want to ask you, because last week you and I did an interview on another broadcast, Media Blackout, which airs on X, Vigilant Fox's Media Blackout, and we spoke about the news that came out of the Australian Parliament.
[03:03:57.309 --> 03:04:04.032]   Most of Parliament Including the Prime Minister supporting Julian Assange coming home, which he should be.
[03:04:04.092 --> 03:04:05.513]  He's an Australian citizen.
[03:04:05.593 --> 03:04:08.194]  It is ridiculous that he's not home already.
[03:04:09.014 --> 03:04:12.075]  But we were waiting for further action.
[03:04:12.436 --> 03:04:15.617]  I personally have not been able to find anything, John.
[03:04:15.917 --> 03:04:18.478]  Do you know of any further action by the Australian Government?
[03:04:21.956 --> 03:04:32.200]  No, but you know the Australian Parliament, the Australian Government and the Australian polity, the people all line up behind Julian these days.
[03:04:33.020 --> 03:04:37.502]  Also your media and other media, alternative media, they all line up.
[03:04:37.522 --> 03:04:41.203]  So I reckon that's pretty good going for us.
[03:04:42.044 --> 03:04:49.632]   The Australian Parliament showed extraordinary courage and fortitude In three particular areas.
[03:04:49.792 --> 03:04:53.976]  One, of course, is the freedom of Julian Assange.
[03:04:54.016 --> 03:05:03.826]  The other one is resisting the extraterritorial application of the United States to other countries.
[03:05:05.687 --> 03:05:25.992]   The second one is to further Australian Sovereignty by insisting, as a Parliament, that the United States accede to the Parliament's wishes and return Julian to his family and to Australia.
[03:05:26.492 --> 03:05:45.290]   And the third, of course, is defending the Australian Parliament, defended Media, free speech, and the capacity of people to speak to each other based on knowledge, which is simply marvellous, I reckon.
[03:05:45.710 --> 03:05:48.590]  So, kudos to the Australian Parliament.
[03:05:49.090 --> 03:06:02.633]  I'm only hoping that the administration of law in the UK can honour their laws and follow the Australian Parliament in its fortitude and courage.
[03:06:04.408 --> 03:06:05.829]  I certainly hope so.
[03:06:05.869 --> 03:06:07.809]  John, what can we expect tomorrow?
[03:06:07.829 --> 03:06:12.491]  What have they said they're going to be addressing tomorrow?
[03:06:13.571 --> 03:06:15.412]  Can we expect a result tomorrow?
[03:06:15.472 --> 03:06:18.413]  Is it likely that this will extend beyond tomorrow?
[03:06:18.292 --> 03:06:28.852]  give us an idea of what we're going to see.
[03:06:28.869 --> 03:06:42.417]  They'll no doubt say that everything that the defence said is simply rubbish and that Julian ought to be exodited from the United Kingdom into the United States more or less tomorrow.
[03:06:43.156 --> 03:06:52.816]  That will be the tone with which they address the matter.
[03:06:52.816 --> 03:06:56.697]   As for the decision from the judges, it will be some time in the future.
[03:06:57.169 --> 03:07:01.191]  So they'll reserve their judgement and go away and think about it.
[03:07:03.091 --> 03:07:13.935]  The Australian Parliament, Government and people putting their weight behind Julian is something that the United Kingdom has to take.
[03:07:14.714 --> 03:07:31.777]  No, I'd see in the August arrangements that the Australian government has given three billion dollars to the United Kingdom to fix up their shipyards that make the Trident submarine or make bits of the Trident submarine.
[03:07:32.317 --> 03:07:45.301]   So I would say that's a pretty strong bit of leverage that the Australian government has and also demonstrates a bit of courage Absolutely.
[03:07:45.340 --> 03:07:53.019]   relationship with the United States, two things that the United Kingdom could greatly benefit
[03:07:53.019 --> 03:07:56.179]  from, in my view.
[03:07:56.179 --> 03:07:58.340]  Absolutely.
[03:07:58.340 --> 03:08:06.539]   And I mean, John, worst case scenario, if Julian is extradited to the United States,
[03:08:06.539 --> 03:08:12.059]   and I'm certainly praying that that does not happen, but if that happens, there is one
[03:08:12.059 --> 03:08:17.300]  final appeal option that I'm aware of.
[03:08:17.396 --> 03:08:18.797]  Can you explain that to us?
[03:08:20.697 --> 03:08:25.079]  Yes, that's the European Court of Human Rights.
[03:08:26.199 --> 03:08:45.079]   I think it's Article 36 that we can make an urgent Appeal, Article 39, make an urgent appeal for the court to stay and then examine the extradition of Julian to the United States.
[03:08:46.160 --> 03:08:48.301]  I don't know how that'll go.
[03:08:48.862 --> 03:09:03.360]   The United Kingdom remains a member of Of the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights system, but whether they will obey it is another matter.
[03:09:05.441 --> 03:09:07.442]  Well, John, we're extremely grateful for you.
[03:09:07.482 --> 03:09:09.643]  I know it's late there now in the UK.
[03:09:10.363 --> 03:09:11.724]  Julian is in our prayers.
[03:09:12.104 --> 03:09:14.805]  We are sharing as much as we possibly can.
[03:09:14.865 --> 03:09:18.326]  For everyone who's watching, make sure you share this information everywhere.
[03:09:19.046 --> 03:09:20.247]  Speak about Assange.
[03:09:20.667 --> 03:09:30.672]  Speak on social media, make this the number one focus of your day, today and tomorrow, as a bare minimum, to make this the top of everyone's minds.
[03:09:31.292 --> 03:09:43.398]  John, I'm going to play a little bit, a clip after the next break, to show everyone a little bit from The Trust Fall, because I think it's very, very important, the way that it's been put together.
[03:09:43.438 --> 03:09:47.900]  Kim, the producer, director there, has done a fantastic job.
[03:09:48.720 --> 03:09:59.685]  To really paint Julian in the correct light because the media has, you know, persistently not been, I think, advocating for him as they should.
[03:10:00.485 --> 03:10:05.427]  There have been a lot of slander pieces, a lot of accusations that have been false against Julian.
[03:10:05.467 --> 03:10:16.532]  Many people who understand freedom and understand the truth have gone looking for it and they understand that he's been misrepresented so many times.
[03:10:17.413 --> 03:10:25.980]  But it's high time that the media starts to really advocate for him as the people have.
[03:10:26.721 --> 03:10:29.724]  Closing comments very quickly, John, we've got about a minute until break.
[03:10:32.146 --> 03:10:38.792]  Well, just quickly, I thank you, I thank Alex Jones and all of the listeners.
[03:10:39.861 --> 03:10:44.345]  And also delighted with the support we've received right around the world.
[03:10:45.486 --> 03:10:47.988]  Gabrielle will be in Washington D.C.
[03:10:49.009 --> 03:10:54.154]  on the 28th for a week and doing tours of Congress.
[03:10:54.534 --> 03:10:55.655]  So thanks everybody.
[03:10:56.055 --> 03:10:57.957]  And Maria, Frank, see you soon.
[03:11:00.010 --> 03:11:01.191]  Thank you so much, John.
[03:11:01.251 --> 03:11:01.872]  God bless you.
[03:11:01.972 --> 03:11:05.255]  We will all be keeping a very close eye on this.
[03:11:05.656 --> 03:11:06.677]  Stay with us, everyone.
[03:11:06.697 --> 03:11:08.278]  We'll be back after this short break.
[03:11:08.338 --> 03:11:19.709]  I want to show you something, a clip that everyone needs to see that I believe will really move the world, including this interview, will really move the world to act on this.
[03:11:20.109 --> 03:11:22.490]  This is not just about Julian, it's about all of us.
[03:11:22.650 --> 03:11:23.251]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:11:23.271 --> 03:11:26.072]  That was John Shipton, Julian Assange's father.
[03:11:26.112 --> 03:11:28.053]  We're very, very grateful that he joined us.
[03:11:28.133 --> 03:11:30.334]  It's late there over there in the UK.
[03:11:30.414 --> 03:11:39.239]  He's been in the court all day waiting to hear what's going to happen with Julian, hearing his lawyers present his side.
[03:11:40.219 --> 03:11:44.282]  And so we're very, very grateful that he joined us in the midst of that ordeal.
[03:11:44.642 --> 03:11:53.187]  I'd like to play everyone a short snippet, the trailer from the new documentary by Kim Statton called The Trust Fall.
[03:11:53.848 --> 03:11:57.550]  I went and saw it at an independent screening.
[03:11:58.072 --> 03:12:01.373]  This is generally the view of people who don't know much about Assange.
[03:12:01.212 --> 03:12:04.652]   everyone to go and watch it. At the moment it's only showing in Australia, New Zealand
[03:12:04.652 --> 03:12:09.952]   and the United Kingdom, with plans I believe to be shown elsewhere, potentially in the
[03:12:09.952 --> 03:12:17.012]   United States. But everyone take a look at this and see who Julian Assange really is.
[03:12:17.012 --> 03:12:26.532]   This is generally the view of people, "Oh, we don't know much about Assange." Well, you
[03:12:26.532 --> 03:12:31.092]   You should know, because whether you know it or not, he is fighting for you.
[03:12:31.158 --> 03:12:36.222]  For your courage, and leadership, and tenacity in journalism and publishing.
[03:12:37.383 --> 03:12:45.509]  Since 2010, Assange has been held in progressively narrower, darker, colder, and crueler spaces.
[03:12:45.749 --> 03:12:51.914]  He has been detained since the 7th of December 2010, in one form or another.
[03:12:52.535 --> 03:12:57.239]  And we are now here, after years of imprisonment.
[03:12:59.480 --> 03:13:02.024]  WikiLeaks is a non-state hostile intelligence service.
[03:13:02.044 --> 03:13:04.107]  I think the man is a high-tech terrorist.
[03:13:04.127 --> 03:13:05.069]  A high-tech terrorist.
[03:13:05.169 --> 03:13:05.590]  A traitor.
[03:13:05.610 --> 03:13:06.211]  A treason.
[03:13:06.431 --> 03:13:08.975]  He has to answer for what he has done.
[03:13:12.426 --> 03:13:18.091]  Assange faces up to 175 years in prison for publishing classified documents exposing U.S.
[03:13:18.151 --> 03:13:18.651]  war crimes.
[03:13:18.671 --> 03:13:19.352]  The U.S.
[03:13:19.432 --> 03:13:22.915]  government narrative about Julian is a complete fraud.
[03:13:22.995 --> 03:13:30.501]  It is a complete fraud from A to Z. Julian took on the most powerful countries in the world.
[03:13:30.841 --> 03:13:31.822]  Basically all of them.
[03:13:35.086 --> 03:13:41.708]  We now have confirmed that there were plans to kidnap Julian here in the center of London, or even assassinate him.
[03:13:42.108 --> 03:13:47.410]  No one who instigated that illegal and immoral war has been brought to justice.
[03:13:47.450 --> 03:13:50.531]  But the great truth teller sits behind bars.
[03:13:51.611 --> 03:13:56.572]  If wars can be started by lies, peace can be started by truth.
[03:13:57.353 --> 03:13:58.673]  Julian Assange is a hero.
[03:14:00.748 --> 03:14:04.851]  What if everything we thought we knew about somebody was a lie?
[03:14:05.591 --> 03:14:09.174]  Would we be willing to go on a new journey of understanding?
[03:14:10.280 --> 03:14:21.886]  This is a story of deception, lies, bravery, and a man who risked everything to bring the truth to light.
[03:14:22.746 --> 03:14:30.650]  Mr. Assange shows all the symptoms that are typical for a person that has been exposed to psychological torture over a prolonged period of time.
[03:14:30.990 --> 03:14:34.652]  He looked at me intensely and said, I hate to say this.
[03:14:36.072 --> 03:14:39.394]  He then hesitated, visibly troubled and searching for words.
[03:14:40.209 --> 03:14:46.209]  And then he finally said, "Please, save my life."
[03:14:46.209 --> 03:14:57.209]   If you think Assad is a traitor, he's a rapist, he's a narcissist, he's a hacker,
[03:14:57.209 --> 03:15:00.209]  I don't blame you because you have been deceived.
[03:15:00.826 --> 03:15:05.947]   And if you think you've not been deceived, that's normal because otherwise it wouldn't be deception.
[03:15:05.947 --> 03:15:24.185]   So you look at the case of Assange and you see how since his persecution, since they began to,
[03:15:25.947 --> 03:15:33.865]   this pursuit of this man who literally just published what he was given.
[03:15:34.047 --> 03:15:36.108]  He published what he was given.
[03:15:37.568 --> 03:15:43.269]  Which is what the Guardian does every day, which is what the Daily Mail do every day.
[03:15:44.406 --> 03:15:45.406]  The ABC.
[03:15:47.407 --> 03:15:53.170]  And not to mention that many of these mainstream media outlets are publishing propaganda and lies.
[03:15:54.770 --> 03:16:01.293]  Telling us blatant lies every single day and zero accountability for these people.
[03:16:01.313 --> 03:16:10.537]  They are trying to bring in legislation in this country, Australia, where Julian is from, literally the greatest journalist in history.
[03:16:12.216 --> 03:16:27.999]  They are trying to bring in legislation that absolves the mainstream media from any responsibility whatsoever for publishing misinformation while people like me would be investigated and potentially imprisoned for daring to tell you, I don't know, what the UN is doing.
[03:16:29.099 --> 03:16:30.399]  Because that's misinformation.
[03:16:33.020 --> 03:16:40.741]  It is so dangerous and you see the increase of the persecution of not only journalists but anyone who dares to tell the truth ever since.
[03:16:42.076 --> 03:16:43.477]  The case of Julian Assange.
[03:16:45.058 --> 03:16:58.029]  So imagine the precedent that this will set if this man, who's been kept in prison, in solitary confinement, literally tormented in order to break his spirit and break his will.
[03:16:59.970 --> 03:17:05.775]  Imagine the precedent that it will set for anyone who dares to tell the truth in future.
[03:17:05.795 --> 03:17:08.397]  Owen Schreyer's had a taste of this.
[03:17:09.787 --> 03:17:12.068]  Oh, and Troyer has had a small taste of this.
[03:17:13.109 --> 03:17:18.812]  What do you think happens if they extradite Assange and he goes to prison for 175 years?
[03:17:20.793 --> 03:17:31.378]  Under the Espionage Act, this will be absolutely historic in the worst possible way.
[03:17:31.458 --> 03:17:34.159]  Recently, you may have caught that interview that Tucker did.
[03:17:34.179 --> 03:17:37.741]  I've forgotten the gentleman's name now, just bear with me.
[03:17:38.664 --> 03:17:45.065]  He did an interview regarding censorship and how people are... Mike Benz.
[03:17:45.825 --> 03:17:46.826]  Tucker and Mike Benz.
[03:17:47.026 --> 03:18:01.809]  And he did an interview regarding how the government, the US government, and probably every single government, gets away with censoring people under the guise of treating these people as though they're domestic terrorists.
[03:18:01.829 --> 03:18:05.149]  They're a threat to democracy, therefore they need to be censored.
[03:18:06.470 --> 03:18:18.203]   Well, these people get put On watchlists, like we saw mums in schools, you know, domestic terrorists, because you don't want your children's genitals cut off or you don't want your children being sexualized in school.
[03:18:19.264 --> 03:18:20.805]  And they get classed as terrorists.
[03:18:21.206 --> 03:18:41.719]   So if Julian Assange, who simply published information, gets trialled under the Espionage Act, gets charged under the Espionage Act, What do you think happens to those school moms who've been classed as domestic terrorists and a threat to democracy in future?
[03:18:44.481 --> 03:18:47.702]  Perhaps people don't understand just how far this will extend to.
[03:18:49.623 --> 03:18:54.085]  What Mike Benz revealed through Tucker Carlson, if you haven't seen that interview you need to go and watch it.
[03:18:54.805 --> 03:19:04.454]   It was one of the most eye-opening interviews that I think the most important interviews that I've seen on the topic of the mechanism of censorship in the world.
[03:19:06.955 --> 03:19:21.025]  Everyone needs to understand how this works and understand that the government has turned its surveillance, its hatred, and absolutely every single possible negative categorization on the people that dare hold it accountable.
[03:19:22.506 --> 03:19:32.074]   And they've been able to do it because of the fact that so many people allowed this to continue with Julian Assange.
[03:19:32.094 --> 03:19:35.116]  I'm not, I'm not beating anyone over the head here.
[03:19:35.256 --> 03:19:37.758]  We have a lot to deal with out there.
[03:19:37.818 --> 03:19:40.760]  We have the sexualization of children agenda.
[03:19:41.020 --> 03:19:42.321]  We have the poison shots.
[03:19:42.381 --> 03:19:48.645]  We have so many different varying agendas, digital identity, digital currency, all of the above.
[03:19:49.466 --> 03:19:54.809]  And it comes at us left, right and center, elections, possible EMPs, cyber attacks.
[03:19:55.850 --> 03:19:58.512]  It comes at us arrows from every single direction.
[03:19:59.764 --> 03:20:03.827]  But how much harder do you think it will be to get the truth out if they succeed?
[03:20:05.127 --> 03:20:13.073]  If they succeed with this politically motivated charge of espionage against a journalist!
[03:20:13.533 --> 03:20:15.974]  Journalism is not spying.
[03:20:17.275 --> 03:20:21.518]  Journalism is not spying and telling the truth is not espionage.
[03:20:24.611 --> 03:20:29.233]  Can you imagine if Julian Assange and Wikileaks were in full swing over the last three years?
[03:20:29.874 --> 03:20:35.457]  How much quicker it would have been to get the truth out about what was happening?
[03:20:35.637 --> 03:20:37.318]  How much more information we'd know?
[03:20:37.758 --> 03:20:39.959]  Maybe we'd know exactly what's in the shots.
[03:20:40.379 --> 03:20:43.181]  Maybe someone would have leaked that anonymously to Wikileaks.
[03:20:43.521 --> 03:20:46.683]  People are afraid to come out publicly.
[03:20:47.463 --> 03:20:51.625]  But there are still a lot of people that will give anonymous information within these agencies.
[03:20:52.706 --> 03:21:00.535]   Imagine If Wikileaks and Julian Assange were in full swing, how much further we'd be along the lines of victory.
[03:21:02.196 --> 03:21:03.817]  We cannot let them get away with this.
[03:21:03.997 --> 03:21:05.698]  So this is my appeal to everyone watching.
[03:21:06.098 --> 03:21:08.900]  Share this interview today with Julian's father.
[03:21:08.980 --> 03:21:10.181]  Share this information.
[03:21:10.601 --> 03:21:15.585]  Go to the trustfall.org if you're in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.
[03:21:16.249 --> 03:21:20.191]  Go to the screening, support the worthy cause, share it everywhere.
[03:21:20.211 --> 03:21:24.693]  And I'll be on the Alex Jones Show in the coming weeks.
[03:21:24.733 --> 03:21:28.635]  I'll let people know when it's showing in the US, hopefully soon.
[03:21:28.655 --> 03:21:33.357]  A huge, again, a huge shout out to Kim Statton for that documentary.
[03:21:33.397 --> 03:21:34.478]  He did a phenomenal job.
[03:21:34.918 --> 03:21:37.679]  And a huge, huge thank you to every single person.
[03:21:37.739 --> 03:21:38.960]  From now, I'm thanking you.
[03:21:39.579 --> 03:21:44.039]   for raising, spending these next two days on raising awareness on Julian Assange.
[03:21:44.039 --> 03:21:46.440]  Do not be silent, speak up everywhere.
[03:21:46.440 --> 03:21:52.159]   Talk to regular people in the street because if they come for him,
[03:21:52.159 --> 03:21:54.679]  they'll come for you and me and everyone else.
[03:21:54.679 --> 03:21:55.519]  God bless you all.
[03:21:55.519 --> 03:21:56.340]  Thank you.
[03:21:56.340 --> 03:21:57.180]  I'll see you soon.
[03:21:57.180 --> 03:22:02.759]   All I do is research, research trends, and I see what is having the best effects,
[03:22:02.759 --> 03:22:04.639]  what is having the best reviews.
[03:22:04.639 --> 03:22:08.399]   So a couple of years ago, I saw different formulas out there
[03:22:08.399 --> 03:22:13.680]   that are known to create compounds in the blood that flush out the body
[03:22:13.680 --> 03:22:18.639]   and that create what they call vasodilation, opening up the arteries, opening up the veins,
[03:22:18.639 --> 03:22:22.559]   which is so important, not just for young people, but especially older people.
[03:22:22.559 --> 03:22:26.600]   And so then I had Dr. Judy Mickiewicz, who's such a renowned scientist and a whistleblower,
[03:22:26.671 --> 03:22:27.811]  She said, I love your formula.
[03:22:27.831 --> 03:22:28.712]  It's one of the best out there.
[03:22:29.272 --> 03:22:32.173]  And so this product, Nitric Boost, became a bestseller.
[03:22:32.573 --> 03:22:36.235]  Well, we decided to soup it up and make it even stronger.
[03:22:36.895 --> 03:22:39.076]  So it's the original formula, just a little bit stronger.
[03:22:39.656 --> 03:22:43.538]  Now Nitric Boost is available at InfoWardStore.com.
[03:22:43.958 --> 03:22:49.260]   Because the problem was, the supplier we had, Couldn't supply enough, we were selling out very, very quickly.
[03:22:49.300 --> 03:22:55.463]  But now we've got a big supply of Nitric Boost in stock, ready to ship at mfowarstore.com.
[03:22:55.824 --> 03:23:05.168]  And when I talk about vasodilation, and the nitric oxide is a potent vasco-dilator, then it can help relax and widen blood vessels.
[03:23:05.528 --> 03:23:10.251]  This can lead to increased blood flow and improve circulation, which is critical to various body functions.
[03:23:10.751 --> 03:23:12.732]  So, ladies and gentlemen, it funds the MFOWAR.
[03:23:13.292 --> 03:23:14.533]  It's an amazing product.
[03:23:14.873 --> 03:23:25.036]  So we have the new and improved, super powerful Nitric Boost back in stock, ready to ship for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:23:25.357 --> 03:23:26.357]  This is a true win-win.
[03:23:26.777 --> 03:23:31.759]  This has the very same effect as some of the male enhancement things out there, but totally naturally.
[03:23:32.239 --> 03:23:36.761]  This does it in a natural way, and not that I need those products, but I've tried them.
[03:23:36.821 --> 03:23:37.601]  I've been to the doctor.
[03:23:37.901 --> 03:23:42.063]  They give you a prescription of it, and I've tried the top brands, the two top brands.
[03:23:42.943 --> 03:23:44.744]  And I'm not even trying to say that's what this is.
[03:23:45.104 --> 03:23:45.944]  That's off-label.
[03:23:45.984 --> 03:23:47.164]  That's not what this is even for.
[03:23:47.444 --> 03:23:48.285]  This is a supplement.
[03:23:48.685 --> 03:23:52.246]  But it is incredible what it does for your body.
[03:23:52.566 --> 03:23:56.907]  So get this amazing product now in stock, ready to ship.
[03:23:57.247 --> 03:24:01.649]  Nitric Boost today at InfoWarStore.com for 40% off.
[03:24:01.929 --> 03:24:03.169]  You fund the InfoWar.

[03:24:04.990 --> 03:24:05.770]  Get it while you can.
[03:24:06.310 --> 03:24:08.152]  Well, nitric oxide is a key.
[03:24:08.212 --> 03:24:10.273]  It's made by our own bodies again.
[03:24:10.673 --> 03:24:14.877]  It's made by L-citrulline and L-arginine, the amino acids.
[03:24:15.197 --> 03:24:16.137]  So we're fed.
[03:24:16.518 --> 03:24:18.499]  You can get it from beet powder and other things.
[03:24:18.599 --> 03:24:24.404]   The nitric oxide relaxes The endothelium, the vasculature, it relaxes the vein.
[03:24:24.704 --> 03:24:26.506]  It's a natural blood pressure.
[03:24:26.526 --> 03:24:28.027]  In fact, I use the two.
[03:24:28.147 --> 03:24:30.649]  Your Info Wars, I keep that on my shelf.
[03:24:31.010 --> 03:24:35.213]  And I feed myself the Cardio Miracle, which is straight food.
[03:24:35.554 --> 03:24:37.455]  It's a different formulation than that one.
[03:24:37.475 --> 03:24:39.918]  And the two together are a one-two punch.
[03:24:39.938 --> 03:24:44.361]  So you get in your food the ability to make what you need and no more.
[03:24:44.522 --> 03:24:45.562]  You've looked at our formula.
[03:24:45.602 --> 03:24:45.983]  You like it?
[03:24:47.145 --> 03:24:47.966]  I did, and I do.
[03:24:48.286 --> 03:24:48.546]  Yes.
[03:24:49.607 --> 03:24:50.728]  I'm not a scientist like you.
[03:24:50.748 --> 03:24:53.130]  What do these compounds do, creating nitrous oxide?
[03:24:53.150 --> 03:24:54.151]  What does it do?
[03:24:54.211 --> 03:24:58.855]  It relaxes the vasculature, so the clot will go through and not restrict.
[03:24:59.175 --> 03:25:00.757]  It allows it to relax.
[03:25:00.837 --> 03:25:10.083]   It lowers the blood pressure, has the toxic Um, synthetic lipid nanoparticles similar to the one in the COVID shot.
[03:25:10.223 --> 03:25:15.346]  We saw athletes dropping dead on the field, passing out, falling down, all the things.
[03:25:15.466 --> 03:25:17.127]  Why is it particularly the athletes?
[03:25:17.527 --> 03:25:21.149]  They're operating at such a high level in their mitochondria.
[03:25:21.189 --> 03:25:27.252]  This is an energy production, oxygen necessary disease because athletes are running.
[03:25:27.592 --> 03:25:41.343]  They're constricted, they're working so that the blood flows and it doesn't flow, which is why your nitric oxide product, that new product, I hope you'll show it, because that's a very important thing to have for acute events.
[03:25:41.423 --> 03:25:47.869]  It dissolves under the tongue, gives you an instant relaxing of your endothelium, your vasculature.
[03:25:47.929 --> 03:25:53.053]  So get Nitric Boost today at infowarstore.com for 40% off.
[03:25:53.453 --> 03:25:54.194]  Get it while you can.
