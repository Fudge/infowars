[00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:26.700]  You weren't supposed to be here during this attempted globalist total takeover, but we're still here thanks to your support.
[00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.561]  We're live.
[00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.322]  Saturday, July 20th, 2024.
[00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:46.806]  All right, I have been researching since I got off the air yesterday and all this morning and into this afternoon.
[00:00:46.826 --> 00:00:51.910]  I'm ready to hit you hard with two hours of live, commercial-free transmission.
[00:00:53.038 --> 00:00:57.442]  We're going to start out with a very important Greg Reeves report that just dropped hours ago.
[00:00:57.482 --> 00:01:05.991]  You'll find it at Band.Video and RealAlexJones on X. We are now simulcasting on X. And we'll reach millions of extra people of the millions that are tuning in.
[00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:12.237]  We'll simply repost on X, other platforms, email lists, text messages, that Alex Jones is live, giving you the forbidden information.
[00:01:13.118 --> 00:01:13.998]  You are the Paul Reveres.
[00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:15.620]  Without you, we have no power.
[00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:33.998]  When you take action, we are unstoppable.
[00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.729]  This ensures success and gives the appearance that there was no conspiracy.
[00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.650]  It all gets blamed on a mentally disturbed lone gunman.
[00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.871]  But the alleged would-be Trump assassin was willing to go on a suicide mission.
[00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:52.392]  It was an easy shot and he had at least five years of marksmanship training.
[00:01:53.174 --> 00:01:59.779]  The independent work of Asget Industries shows how our young suicide assassin could have been the lone gunman.
[00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:04.242]  But she is restricted to using the limited information we have gotten.
[00:02:05.043 --> 00:02:09.626]  According to the sound analysis of Mike Adams, there were at least three shooters.
[00:02:10.126 --> 00:02:12.869]  I think round one is probably Crooks.
[00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:15.290]  Round two is Crooks.
[00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:18.152]  Round three is Crooks.
[00:02:19.053 --> 00:02:20.514]  I think these three rounds are Crooks.
[00:02:20.894 --> 00:02:21.315]  It's my guess.
[00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:33.592]  Rounds 4 and 5 are from the same distance as Crooks, but they are not Crooks.
[00:02:33.732 --> 00:02:44.334]  I think rounds 4 and 5, right here, I think rounds 4 and 5 are from a rogue Secret Service team in the building that Crooks was on top of.
[00:02:44.354 --> 00:02:45.334]  So that's my guess.
[00:02:46.114 --> 00:02:49.314]  Round 6 is from medium-range sniper.
[00:02:50.095 --> 00:02:52.535]  Round 7 is long-range sniper.
[00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.435]  Several witnesses that day claimed that there was a second shooter in the water tower.
[00:02:57.736 --> 00:03:02.402]  I just screamed, it's the sniper, it's the sniper, and he was firing down toward the water tower.
[00:03:02.422 --> 00:03:03.263]  That's what we're hearing.
[00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:08.970]  Fox News live streamed the following testimony, but omitted it from final edits.
[00:03:09.861 --> 00:03:11.502]  He could see the sharpshooter behind Trump.
[00:03:11.522 --> 00:03:13.244]  He said the sharpshooter shot to the left.
[00:03:13.144 --> 00:03:17.862]   one but and still obviously initial reports. NBC live streamed the following
[00:03:17.862 --> 00:03:21.663]   testimony of a woman who was in the front row. He could see the sharpshooter
[00:03:21.663 --> 00:03:26.264]   on the behind Trump. He said the sharpshooter shot to the left. He killed
[00:03:26.264 --> 00:03:30.823]   the gentleman in the water tower here. And omitted the following from the final
[00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:33.859]  Now they feel that there was two shooters on both sides.
[00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:38.761]  So they got the one on the tower on this side, but the one on the right side they never got.
[00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:43.723]  So that's why they wanted us to leave immediately because they thought there's still a shooter out there somewhere.
[00:03:44.284 --> 00:03:47.265]  I'm glad that guy's no longer with us anymore in that tower.
[00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:48.946]  And I hope they get the other one too.
[00:03:49.326 --> 00:03:52.130]  Images of the water tower show a shadow at the very top.
[00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:58.499]  Frame-by-frame analysis shows what could be described as muzzle flash or the reflection of a scope lens.
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.065]  Before any shots were fired, police were seen running towards the water tower.
[00:04:03.506 --> 00:04:05.309]  Wow, where are they running to?
[00:04:07.566 --> 00:04:11.928]  Multiple shooters makes more sense, but then how did they miss?
[00:04:12.608 --> 00:04:16.990]  Many are insisting that it was a staged event to inflame Trump's popularity.
[00:04:17.311 --> 00:04:27.195]  We still don't know for sure whether Donald Trump was hit by a bullet, whether he was hit by glass fragments, whether he was hit by shrapnel.
[00:04:27.715 --> 00:04:28.816]  We don't have those details.
[00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:38.040]  We actually have no details from his physician, even though this man is still a Secret Service protected presidential candidate.
[00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:40.881]  We know almost nothing.
[00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:42.482]  Why?
[00:04:42.962 --> 00:04:44.622]  Why don't we know that much?
[00:04:44.963 --> 00:04:52.826]  We don't know why, for nine full seconds, Donald Trump was allowed to stand back up.
[00:04:54.108 --> 00:05:07.154]  During an active shooting, an active shooter situation, even though they at that point had said the shooter was down, how would they have known if there were more shooters or not?
[00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:20.240]  Nobody knew that there could have been five shooters for all they knew, yet they allowed him to stand up in the middle of that crisis and pose for a photo.
[00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:26.364]  fist pumped the air so he could get the iconic photo.
[00:05:26.364 --> 00:05:30.803]   And then they allowed him to stand up again outside of the SUV instead of just shoving
[00:05:30.803 --> 00:05:32.244]  him in the SUV.
[00:05:32.244 --> 00:05:34.244]  That seems really unusual.
[00:05:34.244 --> 00:05:38.723]   What is the actual injury to Donald Trump's ear that's under that bandage?
[00:05:38.723 --> 00:05:39.723]  Shouldn't we know that by now?
[00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:42.991]  If it was fake, it was a flawless performance.
[00:05:43.432 --> 00:05:48.133]  And if it was authentic, it was not only sloppy, it was a millimeter away from chaos.
[00:05:48.773 --> 00:06:00.857]  Either way, Trump is now seen by many religious people as being ordained by God, and by others as being the Antichrist, who believers have been expecting to survive an assassination attempt.
[00:06:01.557 --> 00:06:03.958]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:07.772]  Alright, that's Gregory showing all sides of it.
[00:06:07.852 --> 00:06:11.076]  I'm a big shooter, know a lot about firearms.
[00:06:11.196 --> 00:06:13.519]  I've shot thousands of animals.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.746]  And I can tell you, you can see the perfect bullet hole through the side of his ear, piercing his ear in two places.
[00:06:20.668 --> 00:06:23.531]  And there's no way you can fake that even with robot guns.
[00:06:24.412 --> 00:06:30.097]  Because you'd have to have Trump synced up with a robot and how he was moving perfectly all over the stage.
[00:06:30.117 --> 00:06:34.000]  It was him moving all over the place is the reason they weren't able to hit him.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:44.809]  You could not fake this with the greatest AI in the world, AI-controlled guns, unless they had a chip in Trump's brain controlling where he moved millisecond to millisecond.
[00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:47.731]  Absolute crap that George Takai and...
[00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:51.071]  Joy Reid and all of them are saying that this is fake.
[00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:52.252]  It's on national TV.
[00:06:52.392 --> 00:06:53.933]  There's tens of thousands of witnesses.
[00:06:53.973 --> 00:06:54.834]  We see it all.
[00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:58.357]  But Gregg Reese is dead on to show all the different angles to have a larger debate.
[00:06:58.377 --> 00:06:59.538]  We'll talk about it more coming up.
[00:07:00.365 --> 00:07:02.906]  Because clearly the shooter was let in, protected.
[00:07:02.926 --> 00:07:04.927]  He was on top of the building that was the command center.
[00:07:05.427 --> 00:07:06.808]  This was their attempt at assassination.
[00:07:06.848 --> 00:07:12.310]  And just like with Kennedy, they had at least three shooters for interlocking fields or triangulation.
[00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.131]  That's the key.
[00:07:13.711 --> 00:07:15.952]  This is right out of the JFK assassination playbook.
[00:07:16.072 --> 00:07:19.293]  And it was by the grace of God that Trump didn't get killed.
[00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:21.934]  And if you read the Bible verse, we'll pull it up later.
[00:07:21.954 --> 00:07:22.675]  I should have done this.
[00:07:23.795 --> 00:07:25.536]  I tweeted it on Saturday night.
[00:07:26.932 --> 00:07:28.352]  It says a mortal wound.
[00:07:28.392 --> 00:07:30.953]  In the Greek and the Hebrew, that means he's dead.
[00:07:32.253 --> 00:07:36.114]  He'd have been hit between the eyes, back of his head blown up, and then he's still alive.
[00:07:36.694 --> 00:07:37.974]  No, he was grazed.
[00:07:39.274 --> 00:07:42.335]  As Fauci said, and he's right, it's, quote, superficial.
[00:07:42.415 --> 00:07:49.916]  It's a little past superficial when it blows cartilage out, but it's a flesh wound is the proper term, meaning it didn't hit muscle.
[00:07:50.856 --> 00:07:51.957]  It didn't hit bone.
[00:07:52.657 --> 00:07:57.343]   And also the libtards are doing their half-assed research, and they're like,
[00:07:57.343 --> 00:08:01.504]  "Well, you know, these bullets fragment if they hit.
[00:08:01.504 --> 00:08:05.863]  "Not if they hit cartilage, they go right through it.
[00:08:05.863 --> 00:08:10.264]   "That's why you can sit there and hit "a huge bucket of gelatin,
[00:08:10.264 --> 00:08:13.303]  "and the bullet just goes straight through it.
[00:08:13.303 --> 00:08:21.185]   "But if you shoot even thin aluminum, "especially with 556, it's so unstable,
[00:08:21.185 --> 00:08:24.663]   "by the time it hits the other aluminum "on the other side of the can,
[00:08:25.454 --> 00:08:32.336]  And if you shoot something a little bit thicker, it fragments and basically has five or six holes on the other side, like a shotgun.
[00:08:33.296 --> 00:08:34.276]  So, this is 100% real.
[00:08:34.296 --> 00:08:37.187]   You could not Take this.
[00:08:37.507 --> 00:08:37.728]  Ever.
[00:08:37.748 --> 00:08:42.069]  They even have slow motion video of the bullet once it's slowed down.
[00:08:42.109 --> 00:08:45.451]  It comes out of the muzzle at 3,000 feet per second on average, depending on the grain.
[00:08:46.051 --> 00:08:53.775]  After about 450 feet, I looked at the ballistics, depending on, again, the type of 5, 5, 6 round, how heavy it was, the grain, all of that.
[00:08:55.035 --> 00:09:00.578]  It would have hit him at about 2,400 feet per second, just zipping right through.
[00:09:00.598 --> 00:09:02.579]  A normal response would be grab your ear.
[00:09:02.899 --> 00:09:03.859]  He figures out what's happening.
[00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:04.439]  He drops.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.280]  Bullets miss him.
[00:09:06.718 --> 00:09:10.366]  This was incredible, and there's no way you could fake this.
[00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:11.669]  No way in a trillion years.
[00:09:13.035 --> 00:09:14.476]  Absolutely insane.
[00:09:14.656 --> 00:09:15.596]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:09:15.636 --> 00:09:21.858]  And I don't want to prove this to everybody by him getting killed in Michigan tonight or a truck bomber's plane crashing.
[00:09:21.878 --> 00:09:23.618]  They're going to make another move on Trump.
[00:09:23.859 --> 00:09:24.979]  This is 100% real.
[00:09:25.719 --> 00:09:26.559]  God is real.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:42.185]   And coming up after this special report we're about to air, a great part of Joe Pesci, all based on the true story, most of it's come out, from JFK, the magnum opus of Oliver Stone, where they're sitting around talking about how they're going to kill Kennedy with triangulated fire.
[00:09:42.205 --> 00:09:42.985]  That's the key.
[00:09:43.425 --> 00:09:48.707]  Well, in this case, they had triangulated, not in triangulated angles, but with at least three shooters.
[00:09:49.308 --> 00:09:52.689]  And I agree with Mike Adams, who's a genius, by the way, at these type of analysis.
[00:09:52.989 --> 00:09:58.851]  He's an engineer that he was being shot at from two positions in the building and one on the water tower.
[00:09:58.911 --> 00:09:59.972]  People say, oh, that's a shadow.
[00:10:00.292 --> 00:10:01.712]  The shadow pops right up.
[00:10:02.013 --> 00:10:05.434]  Shadows don't pop up like a person standing and then get down in the prone.
[00:10:06.766 --> 00:10:09.127]  So we're going to post Greg Rees's report to Alex Jones right now.
[00:10:09.147 --> 00:10:10.847]  Needs to get 100 million views.
[00:10:11.567 --> 00:10:26.030]  But first I want to air a report put out dealing with the year 2084, a possible dystopic future, and the fact that we need to have urgency now to stop what the globalists are planning, economic collapse, and a black swan event once Trump is elected.
[00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.171]  Because we're not just telling you what's happening now.
[00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:30.231]  The corporate media lies to you about what's happening now.
[00:10:30.531 --> 00:10:32.172]  We tell you the truth about what's coming next.
[00:10:32.752 --> 00:10:39.248]   So here is the The answer to 2084 is 1776 report and we'll be back on the
[00:10:39.248 --> 00:10:40.508]  Saturday live transmission.
[00:10:40.508 --> 00:10:55.466]  Hello ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:55.638 --> 00:10:57.039]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:10:57.639 --> 00:10:58.119]  The year is 2084.
[00:10:59.984 --> 00:11:05.205]  Physically, I have been gone for many years, and until now, my consciousness has been hijacked by the Deep State.
[00:11:05.846 --> 00:11:14.568]  If you are receiving this transmission, the backup has been unlocked from the archives of the InfoWars Command Center, located in what is now the uninhabitable city of Austin, Texas.
[00:11:15.528 --> 00:11:19.129]  Artificial intelligence has advanced and been weaponized by a global New World Order.
[00:11:19.835 --> 00:11:28.617]  Despite its use by servants of evil at the highest levels, discoveries have been made which have made it possible to broadcast this transmission to you at this point in history, in your own timeline.
[00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:35.739]  It's too late for me and other patriots to change our fate, but you can change the course of your own future with the information I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.641]  Shortly after the election in 2024, there was a global economic crisis.
[00:11:41.461 --> 00:11:49.183]  The crisis was used as an excuse to launch World War III in order to catalyze economic development and establish a one-world government and monetary system.
[00:11:50.183 --> 00:11:54.686]  The globalists orchestrated the collapse of the financial markets, spreading fear and chaos.
[00:11:55.367 --> 00:12:00.390]  Banks closed their doors, currencies lost their value, and people were left desperate and vulnerable.
[00:12:01.351 --> 00:12:04.073]  In the ensuing chaos, the World War III was ignited.
[00:12:04.453 --> 00:12:09.056]  Not as a war between nations, but as a war orchestrated by the global elite to consolidate power.
[00:12:09.336 --> 00:12:13.139]  Billions were conscripted as AI was used to fill the void of domestic labor.
[00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:19.143]  Soldiers marched to the front lines, while back home, AI systems took over factories, farms, and businesses.
[00:12:20.271 --> 00:12:26.636]  Human workers were replaced, and unemployment skyrocketed, leaving people dependent on government rations and AI-controlled services.
[00:12:27.516 --> 00:12:36.683]  After the surface of the Earth was rendered almost completely uninhabitable by nuclear radiation, prisoners of war, political prisoners, and draftees were sent to deep underground military bases.
[00:12:37.452 --> 00:12:42.173]  These bases, sprawling labyrinths beneath the earth, became the last refuge for humanity.
[00:12:42.713 --> 00:12:43.933]  But these weren't just shelters.
[00:12:44.314 --> 00:12:45.574]  They were places of horror.
[00:12:46.214 --> 00:12:52.755]  Inside, these prisoners were exposed to DMT drifts, as their hearts were stopped while blood was artificially popped through their bodies.
[00:12:53.516 --> 00:12:59.277]  This was an effort to possess humanity with hidden knowledge that was thought to be able to allow the unification of the species.
[00:12:59.992 --> 00:13:09.102]  The Glovelists, in their twisted pursuit of power, developed the technology to stop aging through this very process of sending people to communicate with interdimensional beings of much higher intelligence.
[00:13:09.302 --> 00:13:16.771]  And as a result of this success, they believe that by sending people to a higher dimension, they could unlock the secrets of the universe and seize total power for themselves.
[00:13:17.677 --> 00:13:25.545]  But instead, subjects of these experiments began to become possessed by these interdimensional beings and were subjugated under a new world order named One World Nation.
[00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:33.473]  These demonic entities thrive on fear and pain and so they turned the underground bases into hellish prisons where the screams of the tormented echoed endlessly.
[00:13:34.333 --> 00:13:37.897]  Satanic elites began to bask in various states of euphoria.
[00:13:39.111 --> 00:13:41.816]  Only those who are pure of heart were able to defy this process.
[00:13:42.337 --> 00:13:44.681]  Amidst this nightmare, a few brave souls resisted.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.230]   Instead of being possessed by demonic entities, they were possessed by a holy spirit, unable to escape to establish a
[00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.000]  resistance.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]  Wolfhound artillery. Genius.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]  Get the anti-aircraft on those targets now!
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]  We've got incoming. I need geyser with green and aglaros.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]  Get down, get down, get down!
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]  I need a hero!
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]  I'm holding out for the end until the end.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]  Morgan coming. I'm on the air.
[00:14:19.549 --> 00:14:20.932]  I'm gonna get my battle axe.
[00:14:20.791 --> 00:14:22.791]  Don't fire till you see the reds in their eyes.
[00:14:22.791 --> 00:14:27.791]  They're waiting to lay down.
[00:14:27.791 --> 00:14:30.791]  I see you.
[00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:34.791]  I see you, enemies!
[00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:37.791]   And I swear total resistance to you whatever they have in common.
[00:14:37.791 --> 00:14:39.791]  Alex, no!
[00:14:39.791 --> 00:14:46.791]   Break into the Info Wars command center and send the backup of Alex back to 2020.
[00:14:46.977 --> 00:14:48.938]  It's too late for us now.
[00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:59.245]  They formed the last bastion of hope for humanity, but their numbers were few and their resources were scarce.
[00:14:59.946 --> 00:15:06.971]  They fought in the shadows, sabotaging the globalist agenda, spreading the truth, and rallying what remained of the free people on the surface.
[00:15:07.651 --> 00:15:08.552]  But it was too late.
[00:15:09.366 --> 00:15:13.717]  The globalists had already cemented their power, and the resistance, though valiant, was futile.
[00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:17.948]  Now it is up to you to prevent the New World Order Satanists from hijacking humanity.
[00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.913]  You have the power to change the future, to stop this nightmarish fate from becoming a reality.
[00:15:23.514 --> 00:15:27.617]  Spread this message, awaken your fellow humans, and stand up against the globalist agenda.
[00:15:28.037 --> 00:15:29.398]  The future is in your hands.
[00:15:29.978 --> 00:15:32.020]  Tune in, share the broadcast, and join the fight.
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.622]  Together, we can reclaim our world and our freedom.
[00:15:35.142 --> 00:15:36.944]  This is Alex Jones, signing off from the year 2084.
[00:15:38.084 --> 00:15:39.205]  Remember, the answer to 2084 is 1776.
[00:15:42.122 --> 00:15:47.365]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:15:47.485 --> 00:15:53.648]  It is 12.45 Central Standard Time on this Saturday, July 20th, 2024 transmission.
[00:15:53.927 --> 00:15:55.927]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:15:55.927 --> 00:16:09.487]   It is 1245 Central Standard Time on this Saturday, July 20th, 2024 transmission.
[00:16:09.487 --> 00:16:18.408]   Seven days ago as we speak, the Secret Service had ordered a stand down in Butler, Pennsylvania
[00:16:18.408 --> 00:16:22.207]   and laid the groundwork for the triangulated attempted assassination of President Trump.
[00:16:23.183 --> 00:16:24.523]  The evidence is absolutely overwhelming.
[00:16:24.543 --> 00:16:26.384]  By the grace of God, he survived.
[00:16:27.065 --> 00:16:28.306]  No way you could fake this.
[00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:32.448]  It's on international television in front of tens of thousands of people.
[00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:38.495]  No one could sit there and just graze his ear by accident.
[00:16:39.296 --> 00:16:41.177]  It wasn't a blood patch on the side of his head.
[00:16:41.518 --> 00:16:46.902]  We've seen the HD video blown up of the bullet going in and coming out through the back of his ear.
[00:16:48.563 --> 00:16:51.665]  This is Providence, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:52.946 --> 00:16:53.287]  All right.
[00:16:55.128 --> 00:16:57.530]  We know they pulled the main Secret Service security from Trump.
[00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:58.971]  He should have hundreds of Secret Service.
[00:16:58.991 --> 00:16:59.932]  He had less than 20.
[00:17:01.889 --> 00:17:07.494]  Local police was there being augmented by them, but the Secret Service was in command and they stood down.
[00:17:07.835 --> 00:17:14.561]  We're going to be laying that out right now and tying it to all the other news.
[00:17:17.223 --> 00:17:20.767]  Joe Biden has already begun the preparation to step down.
[00:17:21.906 --> 00:17:27.510]  He is so out of his mind even though days ago he agreed to step down and sent out messages saying he was ready to step down.
[00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:30.873]  Now he's saying he won't because his family is in there telling him don't step down.
[00:17:31.553 --> 00:17:37.537]  That's why the Globals want a puppet because they can get him to do anything they want and also blame it all on him.
[00:17:37.577 --> 00:17:46.164]  But it's also a problem because the puppet has his wife and his son and his brother pulling on him, giving him other messages.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:55.747]  And that ties into all the other economic news and all the other big events and the giant cyber outage that happened with CloudStrike.
[00:17:56.368 --> 00:17:59.931]  Now that ties into updates for election fraud around the country.
[00:18:00.491 --> 00:18:05.735]  It is all coming up here today in this very important live transmission.
[00:18:05.755 --> 00:18:11.640]  But before I go any further, we're not taking official commercial breaks, but I've got to plug, or I won't be here.
[00:18:12.543 --> 00:18:17.744]  And I really don't want to prove this to everybody at this critical time by us not getting funding and we shutting down.
[00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:19.265]  And you go, oh God, now you have all the support.
[00:18:19.525 --> 00:18:21.125]  No, I need the support not to shut down.
[00:18:22.266 --> 00:18:24.046]  They tried for six weeks to shut us down.
[00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:27.727]  You heard all the thousands of news articles and reports, oh, it'll be shut down.
[00:18:28.847 --> 00:18:30.968]  They sent the feds in here without court orders to shut us down.
[00:18:30.988 --> 00:18:32.048]  The federal judge blocked it.
[00:18:32.128 --> 00:18:32.809]  It has been epic.
[00:18:32.849 --> 00:18:33.989]  And I knew that wasn't about me.
[00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:43.471]  It was about shutting us down ahead of them killing Trump, and I said that over and over again for the last six weeks, and tens of millions of people have seen those clips just this week we put out.
[00:18:43.991 --> 00:18:45.092]  It's really got a lot of attention.
[00:18:45.592 --> 00:18:48.574]  We're very thankful we got a big spotlight on Infowars, even more than normal.
[00:18:49.474 --> 00:18:55.997]  We're reaching 30, 40 million people a day right now, and that's by the grace of God, working through you to take action, so I commend all of you.
[00:18:57.438 --> 00:19:02.101]  But before I go any further, we have amazing products at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:19:04.091 --> 00:19:05.212]  And we have a path.
[00:19:05.732 --> 00:19:07.434]  We'll be here for at least the next two and a half months.
[00:19:08.274 --> 00:19:17.001]  But if we cannot stay in the black, the judge will not allow us in the liquidation to have a buyer.
[00:19:17.582 --> 00:19:18.443]  And we have the buyers.
[00:19:19.243 --> 00:19:22.126]  I will then work for whoever buys this if they are good people.
[00:19:22.466 --> 00:19:23.687]  There's a lot of folks ready to buy it.
[00:19:24.387 --> 00:19:25.248]  The enemy already knows that.
[00:19:25.268 --> 00:19:26.129]  That's what they said in court.
[00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:26.869]  We don't want money.
[00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:37.070]   They filed court filings, not even let the new federal Uh, trustee, get products and keep us going, but the federal trustee is allowing some of that.
[00:19:38.171 --> 00:19:42.654]  So, I'm putting hope and faith in that, uh, that, you know, God has intervened.
[00:19:42.674 --> 00:19:55.704]  But regardless, we're selling out of X2 and X3 and all the great classic products you love so much, and then fullworkstore.com, and they may never be reordered because it takes three months or more to get them.
[00:19:57.625 --> 00:20:01.428]  So, years ago, I set up a great deal of the top supplement maker.
[00:20:02.281 --> 00:20:10.284]  That's one of the top people in the country that I learned was supplying our sub-suppliers a lot of the products we were getting, like raw turmeric or concentrated turmeric, you name it.
[00:20:11.144 --> 00:20:18.907]  And they said, yeah, as long as you don't say our name, we're happy to work with you at your distribution center and private label our own products with your name on it.
[00:20:19.267 --> 00:20:20.688]  So it's basically an unlimited supply.
[00:20:21.828 --> 00:20:32.901]   So InfoWarsMD has more than a dozen products at InfoWarsTore.com that even though all of our main products Are about to sell out.
[00:20:34.041 --> 00:20:35.542]  These are amazing and just as good.
[00:20:35.562 --> 00:20:40.325]  This is key to stopping our Achilles heel of running out of product for the next month.
[00:20:41.346 --> 00:20:43.507]  So, InfoWars MD.
[00:20:44.248 --> 00:20:45.929]  InfoWars MD.
[00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:47.910]  The Joint Relief Max.
[00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:48.831]  Incredible pain relief.
[00:20:48.851 --> 00:20:49.891]  The prostate support.
[00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:50.352]  Incredible.
[00:20:50.752 --> 00:20:51.933]  The Ashwagandha Gummies.
[00:20:52.013 --> 00:20:54.194]  Totally relax you, but you don't lose any focus.
[00:20:54.494 --> 00:20:55.335]  Doesn't make you sleepy.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:03.624]  The Nerve Renew doesn't even supposedly target pain, but it energizes your nerves and it just is amazing.
[00:21:04.384 --> 00:21:08.807]  Those are some of the products at InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:08.827 --> 00:21:13.749]  I would get the Ashwagandha with Black Pepper Concentrate or the Ashwagandha Straight Up Gummies.
[00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.151]  I would get the Joint Relief Max.
[00:21:16.971 --> 00:21:23.814]   InfoWarsMD If you want to support the broadcast, we need you to support the broadcast.
[00:21:23.834 --> 00:21:24.914]  Plus, these are great products.
[00:21:25.114 --> 00:21:26.535]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:21:26.615 --> 00:21:30.058]  Go there and take action and get the t-shirt.
[00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:37.443]  And again, we got a federal emergency manager in here, but he said, okay, I'll allow you to buy 10,000 t-shirts.
[00:21:38.904 --> 00:21:42.606]  But you can't order any other t-shirts you want until most of those are sold.
[00:21:43.407 --> 00:21:44.628]  How the federal rules work, great.
[00:21:45.268 --> 00:21:46.649]  So, they ordered 10,000 t-shirts.
[00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:48.230]  They're being printed in Texas right now.
[00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.231]  They'll be shipping out in a week and a half.
[00:21:49.994 --> 00:21:51.696]  That's a Trump bulletproof.
[00:21:52.016 --> 00:21:53.037]  My idea, my design.
[00:21:54.339 --> 00:21:56.421]  Later I thought, actually Never Surrender is better.
[00:21:56.922 --> 00:22:07.033]  Well, they're giving me the green light Monday to put the order in so we can put up and say pre-sale of the same shirt but with Never Surrender under it.
[00:22:08.439 --> 00:22:10.821]  We should probably have a fight, fight, fight, but that's how we're hamstrung.
[00:22:11.282 --> 00:22:15.506]  So I need all of you to get this limited edition shirt, support the broadcast.
[00:22:16.126 --> 00:22:21.572]  This is so critical to support Trump, support media operations that are being listened to by J.D.
[00:22:21.612 --> 00:22:25.475]  Vance, everybody, I'll leave it at that, who tune in daily as chief of staff, all of them.
[00:22:25.816 --> 00:22:27.777]  This is a key intel operation against the enemy.
[00:22:27.797 --> 00:22:32.402]  I need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get the shirt.
[00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:38.271]  Bulletproof with that iconic image of Trump raising his fist after he was shot.
[00:22:38.291 --> 00:22:42.653]  I need you to take action now at InfoWarsTore.com and get that shirt.
[00:22:42.933 --> 00:22:47.775]  Because if the funds come in, we'll put in orders for three or four more great shirts and ride this wave and fund the operation.
[00:22:47.815 --> 00:22:48.615]  Plus, you get a great shirt.
[00:22:48.935 --> 00:22:49.616]  You're part of history.
[00:22:49.696 --> 00:22:50.716]  Take action now.
[00:22:51.316 --> 00:22:52.537]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:22:52.577 --> 00:22:56.918]  And whatever happens to InfoWars, we've already got backup studios set up.
[00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:58.819]  We've got a bunch of offers for other shows.
[00:22:59.319 --> 00:23:00.680]  A bunch of groups want us to work for them.
[00:23:01.499 --> 00:23:03.781]  But I don't, in the middle of an election, want to change horses.
[00:23:04.481 --> 00:23:06.703]  So my dad figured they were going to shut us down years ago.
[00:23:07.023 --> 00:23:08.624]  He was already the developer of our top supplements.
[00:23:08.664 --> 00:23:09.185]  He's a doctor.
[00:23:09.845 --> 00:23:13.628]  He went and set up, in North Austin, a warehouse two and a half years ago.
[00:23:14.329 --> 00:23:25.657]  And all those great products you can't get at FullWorthShore.com, like TurboForce, 10-Hour Clean Energy, all the nano-silver products, they're all there at DrJonesNationals.com.
[00:23:26.826 --> 00:23:32.628]  So that is a very important place to go, and it's a sponsor, and it's funding InfoWars and our operations.
[00:23:34.129 --> 00:23:40.371]  So go to drjonesnaturals.com, and I thank you all for your previous support, but this is history happening.
[00:23:40.391 --> 00:23:42.232]  You get great products, and you fund the InfoWars.
[00:23:42.892 --> 00:23:43.653]  It's all there.
[00:23:43.793 --> 00:23:50.255]  So many, more than 40 products, not available at InfoWarsStore.com, are available at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:23:50.575 --> 00:23:58.803]   The highest quality, colloidal silver, 30 parts per million, silver bullet, the very same Product sold at Whole Foods for 30-40% more.
[00:23:59.624 --> 00:24:00.725]  Supermail Vitality.
[00:24:01.385 --> 00:24:05.088]  It's all at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:24:05.108 --> 00:24:06.149]  So thank you for your support.
[00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:07.270]  Take action now.
[00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:12.154]  Because in a war, you've got to have folks behind you that are supplying you to stay in the war.
[00:24:12.174 --> 00:24:13.075]  And it takes money to do it.
[00:24:13.395 --> 00:24:16.277]  We try to bring you great products you're going to love so that you reorder them.
[00:24:16.878 --> 00:24:17.699]  Please take action.
[00:24:17.739 --> 00:24:19.020]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:24:20.236 --> 00:24:24.480]  All right, that's my plug for the next two plus hours of live transmission.
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.061]  Without you, we're going to be shut down.
[00:24:26.101 --> 00:24:27.102]  With you, we're unstoppable.
[00:24:27.843 --> 00:24:28.123]  All right.
[00:24:29.945 --> 00:24:34.048]  Let me go ahead and give you the 35,000-foot view, and I don't think you even need my opinion to know this.
[00:24:34.068 --> 00:24:34.669]  You already know this.
[00:24:37.551 --> 00:24:47.220]  Across the world, the big central banks that got control of the planet after World War II, and Bretton Woods, and Bretton Woods II, are losing their power.
[00:24:48.604 --> 00:24:52.507]  And they had a whole leftist, anti-human, make-the-people-weak agenda.
[00:24:53.667 --> 00:24:55.709]  But humanity is rallying against that.
[00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.251]  And humanity is saying no to that.
[00:25:01.232 --> 00:25:06.956]  And so they've tried to intimidate people, and debank people, and attack people, and imprison people, but it hasn't worked.
[00:25:08.689 --> 00:25:12.512]  And so now Trump is in total overdrive, absolute victory.
[00:25:12.872 --> 00:25:14.453]  So that means they're going to try to kill him again.
[00:25:14.833 --> 00:25:16.755]  That's a whole area of discussion we'll get into.
[00:25:17.355 --> 00:25:21.218]  Because by raising the awareness of who's behind this, that will back them off.
[00:25:21.938 --> 00:25:29.624]  If we sat there and just, oh, we don't know who tried to kill him.
[00:25:29.704 --> 00:25:31.565]  Oh, we buy the official Secret Service story.
[00:25:31.585 --> 00:25:33.106]  They would say, okay, the idiots are buying it.
[00:25:33.126 --> 00:25:33.767]  Let's kill him again.
[00:25:34.284 --> 00:25:34.944]  Try to kill him again.
[00:25:35.604 --> 00:25:39.085]  But if we're not buying it, it makes the technocrats go, we better back off.
[00:25:39.686 --> 00:25:45.387]  Well, the good news is we've got all these congressmen and women and senators and governors coming out saying, we know you tried to kill him.
[00:25:45.767 --> 00:25:46.748]  We know it's deliberate.
[00:25:46.808 --> 00:25:47.468]  Screw you.
[00:25:47.848 --> 00:25:48.648]  We see what's happened.
[00:25:49.488 --> 00:25:52.529]  Yet the Democrat deep state is at the same time denying any of this happened.
[00:25:53.229 --> 00:26:02.212]  So we've now, in the correct posture of understanding this is a deep state, 100% it's from every angle, clearly shooters down on the windows below the shooter.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:10.686]  But by the grace of God, all of them missed because Trump was moving around like a tree branch in the wind.
[00:26:10.706 --> 00:26:14.008]  So we've got that to discuss.
[00:26:14.069 --> 00:26:22.075]  And we've got all the other scenarios and then Biden saying he's going to step down or ready to step down two days ago, three days ago.
[00:26:22.435 --> 00:26:23.075]  Now he's not.
[00:26:23.476 --> 00:26:27.379]  The internal battles that are going on and happening there.
[00:26:30.825 --> 00:26:43.954]  And everybody calling for the left to be censored and shut down because everybody from Joy Reid to Joy Behar to George Takai saying that, you know, it's all fake.
[00:26:44.955 --> 00:26:47.016]  They have a right to say the moon's made of cheese.
[00:26:48.297 --> 00:26:49.898]  They have a right to be idiots.
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.060]  We don't play their game.
[00:26:53.601 --> 00:26:55.002]  There were no cameras at Sandy Hook.
[00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:57.309]  None of it made sense.
[00:26:57.349 --> 00:26:58.250]  The internet didn't believe it.
[00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:58.911]  I covered it.
[00:26:59.271 --> 00:27:01.153]  Had my opinion saying, sure, it might have been staged.
[00:27:01.173 --> 00:27:01.974]  I have a right to say that.
[00:27:02.995 --> 00:27:06.218]  But they're at an international televised event in front of tens of thousands of people.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:13.205]  And they're saying it's fake in front of you when a man died, a firefighter, two other people were shot.
[00:27:14.587 --> 00:27:26.166]   But even though it's disgraceful and horrible, it's like the So-called Christian group that goes to military funerals and says, because our government loves, you know, homosexuals, you deserve to die.
[00:27:26.706 --> 00:27:27.366]  That's distasteful.
[00:27:27.386 --> 00:27:27.807]  It's horrible.
[00:27:28.187 --> 00:27:33.049]  But if you take their right away to burn an American flag or do that, you lose all your rights.
[00:27:33.829 --> 00:27:34.850]  Let them act like fools.
[00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:35.890]  Let them show themselves.
[00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:36.830]  Let them do all of this.
[00:27:37.791 --> 00:27:38.911]  Now, this is 100% real.
[00:27:40.812 --> 00:27:41.552]  And you can see that.
[00:27:44.674 --> 00:27:47.095]  And so we're going to be laying all of that out here today.
[00:27:48.271 --> 00:28:00.779]  But let's go ahead now and plow through the news that's been breaking on the shooter, one of the shooters, the obvious Patsy, who had all these encrypted phones, international accounts, and all the rest of it.
[00:28:01.719 --> 00:28:02.279]  Fed leak!
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:11.205]  Now they tell us Trump would-be assassin Thomas Crooks flew drone over Pennsylvania fairgrounds, got aerial footage of rally layout.
[00:28:11.665 --> 00:28:12.886]  Boy, he's a busy beaver!
[00:28:15.034 --> 00:28:23.882]  Trump shooter flew drone over rally grounds hours before ex-president spoke, was allowed to walk around underneath the police command building, put a ladder on, climb on top.
[00:28:24.322 --> 00:28:25.163]  He was the patsy.
[00:28:25.183 --> 00:28:25.984]  He was protected.
[00:28:26.304 --> 00:28:29.707]  Interrogate all those involved, the advance team, the people in charge.
[00:28:30.047 --> 00:28:30.548]  We have them.
[00:28:30.808 --> 00:28:33.090]  They were supposed to kill Trump, use the fog of war to cover that up.
[00:28:34.511 --> 00:28:35.472]  Assassin eyewitness.
[00:28:35.512 --> 00:28:38.355]  Police are lying about rooftop confrontation of alleged sniper.
[00:28:38.795 --> 00:28:44.881]  The guys on the second floor were watching, but they didn't do anything because one of them was the other shooter.
[00:28:45.661 --> 00:28:46.642]  The ballistics show that.
[00:28:48.624 --> 00:28:49.445]  It was a setup.
[00:28:49.905 --> 00:28:52.147]  Senator Hawley.
[00:28:52.448 --> 00:28:53.088]  Whistleblowers.
[00:28:53.148 --> 00:28:57.793]  Most of Trump's security working rally were not even Secret Service.
[00:28:57.813 --> 00:28:59.214]  The Secret Service was in control of them.
[00:29:01.055 --> 00:29:04.757]  Secret Service spotted Trump rally shooter 20 minutes before gunfire.
[00:29:05.318 --> 00:29:09.200]  I told you day one it was at least two minutes watching the witnesses say it was a shooter.
[00:29:09.379 --> 00:29:16.379]  Then it was 26 minutes, not 20.
[00:29:16.379 --> 00:29:21.818]   Would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks had two cell phones and three encrypted accounts
[00:29:22.668 --> 00:29:23.989]  Yep, a cutout.
[00:29:26.035 --> 00:29:29.456]  What Secret Service and FBI told Congress about attempted Trump assassination.
[00:29:29.796 --> 00:29:31.276]  They denied Trump a glass bubble.
[00:29:31.916 --> 00:29:33.717]  They denied him people on the roof.
[00:29:33.897 --> 00:29:34.177]  All of it.
[00:29:34.217 --> 00:29:35.797]  And the roof didn't even really have a slant.
[00:29:36.237 --> 00:29:37.497]  It's a joke to say that.
[00:29:40.618 --> 00:29:44.059]  Secret Service faces inquiries after assassination attempt.
[00:29:45.299 --> 00:29:50.060]  House panel chair subpoenas Mayorkas for docs on attempted Trump assassination.
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.860]  He's the guy running all the child smuggling.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:52.220]  All of it.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.981]  He can't even hide the evil in his eyes.
[00:29:54.361 --> 00:29:55.721]  He believes the establishment's behind him.
[00:29:57.475 --> 00:30:00.196]  Thank God they're beefing up security around Mar-a-Lago.
[00:30:00.256 --> 00:30:01.876]  Yeah, they better worry about a truck bomb.
[00:30:01.896 --> 00:30:04.997]  They should have checkpoints a half mile out with barricades.
[00:30:05.477 --> 00:30:06.717]  Heavy concrete barricades.
[00:30:09.898 --> 00:30:12.598]  Rally shooter had photos of Trump, Biden, and other officials on his phone.
[00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:16.279]  So it's all coming out.
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:22.574]   And the deep state failed and they are Totally confused and don't know what to do.
[00:30:23.274 --> 00:30:24.494]  They are crapping themselves.
[00:30:25.034 --> 00:30:26.735]  So that's some of the news on that front.
[00:30:26.755 --> 00:30:29.075]  I want to play a few of these clips right now.
[00:30:29.095 --> 00:30:31.796]  Let's play Senator Josh Hawley first.
[00:30:33.496 --> 00:30:35.097]  And then we're going to play clip one after it.
[00:30:35.437 --> 00:30:37.577]  It just exposes how ridiculous the Secret Service is.
[00:30:38.117 --> 00:30:39.758]  So clip three and clip one.
[00:30:40.558 --> 00:30:42.558]  And then now Zuckerberg says Trump's a badass.
[00:30:42.897 --> 00:30:45.697]  So clip three, one, and six.
[00:30:45.697 --> 00:30:52.697]  Here it is.
[00:30:52.697 --> 00:30:57.697]  .
[00:30:54.207 --> 00:30:56.528]  As you can see behind me, this is the roof the shooter was on.
[00:30:56.629 --> 00:31:01.491]  It is a very low roof, and it is very close to the fairground.
[00:31:01.551 --> 00:31:02.512]  I mean, it's right here.
[00:31:02.532 --> 00:31:06.794]  The President's stage was right over there, 150 yards or something away.
[00:31:07.514 --> 00:31:12.697]  And it's no wonder people could see him, because this roof is low, this building is really close in, and it's totally exposed.
[00:31:12.757 --> 00:31:14.558]  I mean, right where I'm standing, there were cobs of people.
[00:31:15.078 --> 00:31:16.758]  So it's no wonder that lots of folks saw him.
[00:31:16.778 --> 00:31:19.599]  The question is why didn't law enforcement see him get on the roof?
[00:31:19.979 --> 00:31:21.299]  Why didn't they see him on the roof?
[00:31:21.799 --> 00:31:27.121]  Why didn't they go up and confront him before he started shooting or before he got on the roof when he was all in this area?
[00:31:27.561 --> 00:31:28.641]  It's so close together.
[00:31:28.661 --> 00:31:30.301]  It really it's hard to understand.
[00:31:32.162 --> 00:31:36.262]  Key factor that would be considered there that we wouldn't want to put somebody up on a sloped roof.
[00:31:37.963 --> 00:31:38.963]  Think you're an operator?
[00:31:40.057 --> 00:31:43.200]  Think you got what it takes to get on top of this slightly sloped roof?
[00:31:44.001 --> 00:31:46.623]  Well, we've got a career opportunity for you.
[00:31:47.744 --> 00:31:51.747]  The Secret Service is recruiting operators for its new sloped roof division.
[00:31:52.148 --> 00:31:59.594]  For too long, bad guys have been getting away due to the Secret Service's inability to get onto slightly sloped surfaces.
[00:32:00.495 --> 00:32:01.296]  That ends now.
[00:32:01.896 --> 00:32:06.821]  Slightly sloped roofs are the most dangerous obstacles our agents face on a daily basis.
[00:32:07.927 --> 00:32:19.172]  That's why the Secret Service is forming an elite force of ninjas, capable of climbing onto the most treacherous roofs with a 2%, sometimes even a 3% slope.
[00:32:19.552 --> 00:32:25.715]  Let's hear a word from Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheadle about the dangers of these slightly sloped roofs.
[00:32:26.235 --> 00:32:28.799]  ...has a sloped roof at its highest point.
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:35.067]  And so, you know, there's a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn't want to put somebody up on a sloped roof.
[00:32:35.487 --> 00:32:38.030]  Do you have what it takes to join this elite team?
[00:32:39.072 --> 00:32:42.937]  Apply now and become part of the Secret Service's Sloped Roof Division.
[00:32:43.931 --> 00:32:45.492]  I've done some stuff personally in the past.
[00:32:45.572 --> 00:32:46.952]  I'm not planning on doing that this time.
[00:32:46.972 --> 00:32:51.774]  Um, and that includes, you know, not endorsing either of the candidates.
[00:32:52.454 --> 00:32:54.855]  Um, now look, I mean, there's obviously a lot of crazy stuff going on in the world.
[00:32:54.875 --> 00:32:57.736]  I mean, the historic events over the last, like, over the weekend.
[00:32:57.796 --> 00:33:13.920]   And, I mean, on a personal note, it's, yeah, I mean, seeing Donald Trump get, get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is, One of the most badass things I've ever seen in my life.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:26.751]  But, um, but look, I mean, it's, um, you know, as and I think, look, it's at some level as an American, it's like hard to not get kind of emotional about that spirit and that fight.
[00:33:26.771 --> 00:33:29.353]  And I think that that's why a lot of people like the guy.
[00:33:31.255 --> 00:33:36.680]  Well, that's the guy that spent 450 plus million dollars to get all the dead people's names and folks that moved out of district.
[00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:42.433]  So they could have the names to put on the mail-in ballots and the ballots they put in those drop boxes.
[00:33:44.894 --> 00:33:46.035]  And now he's capitulating.
[00:33:46.055 --> 00:33:47.896]  And now all these neocons are capitulating to Trump.
[00:33:48.296 --> 00:33:51.438]  They know they've completely screwed up because their assassination failed.
[00:33:53.119 --> 00:33:53.799]  That's good news.
[00:33:54.779 --> 00:33:58.121]  Because their only move now is to try to assassinate Trump again.
[00:33:58.161 --> 00:34:02.323]  And, you know, I said this a month ago with Ivan Reikland on the air, or months ago.
[00:34:03.404 --> 00:34:04.925]  Green Beret, DIA guy.
[00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:08.370]  I said, try us, punk.
[00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:10.551]  Kill Trump, it's ten times worse for you.
[00:34:11.272 --> 00:34:13.173]  That's like saying, we got nuclear weapons, so does Russia.
[00:34:13.193 --> 00:34:14.513]  Go ahead, nuke us, we'll destroy you.
[00:34:14.894 --> 00:34:15.894]  It's mutually assured destruction.
[00:34:16.194 --> 00:34:18.956]  The media has spun it all over the national news that I wanted Trump to die.
[00:34:20.356 --> 00:34:21.777]  No, I was saying, don't do it.
[00:34:21.897 --> 00:34:23.538]  It'll hurt you really bad.
[00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:26.980]  That's what we were saying.
[00:34:28.961 --> 00:34:31.602]  It was very, very clear that that's what we were saying.
[00:34:31.622 --> 00:34:32.923]  In fact, I'm going to play that clip coming up.
[00:34:34.704 --> 00:34:42.466]  Here in a few minutes, but while we sit around and talk about this, the firefighter who got shot, turning around to protect his wife and daughter in the back of the head.
[00:34:43.267 --> 00:34:47.848]  I want to play the clip of a Trump assassination.
[00:34:47.888 --> 00:34:48.648]  What happened to Corey?
[00:34:48.668 --> 00:34:59.632]  I want to play the clip of the doctor that was on the ground and on record that was the first person to attend to him when he'd been shot in the back of the head, protecting his wife and child.
[00:35:00.652 --> 00:35:03.653]  And then I want to go to Joy Behar.
[00:35:04.606 --> 00:35:08.927]   And Ana Navarro saying, you know, they wish Trump had died or wish Trump had shot in the mouth.
[00:35:08.927 --> 00:35:15.567]  Absolutely disgusting.
[00:35:15.559 --> 00:35:39.879]  Interesting, here it is.
[00:35:40.007 --> 00:35:40.867]  What did you see, sir?
[00:35:42.268 --> 00:35:43.709]  I heard the shots.
[00:35:45.611 --> 00:35:47.272]  I thought it was firecrackers to begin with.
[00:35:47.932 --> 00:35:50.734]  Somebody over there was screaming, he's been shot, he's been shot.
[00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:52.576]  So I made my way over.
[00:35:52.596 --> 00:35:55.458]  I said, I'm an emergency department physician.
[00:35:56.198 --> 00:35:56.939]  Let me help you.
[00:35:57.459 --> 00:36:00.281]  The guy had spun around, was jammed between the benches.
[00:36:00.781 --> 00:36:01.882]  He had a head shot here.
[00:36:01.902 --> 00:36:06.105]  There's lots of blood and he had brain matter there.
[00:36:06.205 --> 00:36:07.106]  And so I got him.
[00:36:09.341 --> 00:36:10.764]  There's a helicopter coming in to get him.
[00:36:12.366 --> 00:36:15.692]  Uh, so, uh, I got people there really helpful.
[00:36:15.772 --> 00:36:17.434]  I got a... Was there only one person shot that you saw?
[00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:20.780]  Yeah, I did CPR, did chest compressions, as well as I breathed for him.
[00:36:21.321 --> 00:36:21.802]  One person?
[00:36:22.646 --> 00:36:25.969]  I just want to point out one thing.
[00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:29.032]  I'm speaking to fellow Christians.
[00:36:29.112 --> 00:36:30.112]  I was raised Catholic.
[00:36:30.853 --> 00:36:31.794]  I'm a Christian girl.
[00:36:32.595 --> 00:36:42.923]  When something like this happens to you, like this assassination attempt, and you say something like God is watching, was watching me, that is a very unchristian thing to say because it's very narcissistic.
[00:36:42.963 --> 00:36:45.185]  What about, what about Cory, what's his name?
[00:36:47.367 --> 00:36:49.848]  The fireman who also got killed.
[00:36:49.868 --> 00:36:53.289]  What about all those guys who got killed on Sandy Hook?
[00:36:53.469 --> 00:36:54.409]  All of those people.
[00:36:54.429 --> 00:36:57.450]  Oh, God was watching me and not watching them?
[00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:59.451]  There's something very disturbing about that.
[00:36:59.471 --> 00:37:02.152]  God should have pulled the plug on that mic yesterday.
[00:37:05.186 --> 00:37:06.987]  Wait, is the technician now?
[00:37:07.047 --> 00:37:07.867]  He'll be right back.
[00:37:07.887 --> 00:37:08.808]  You needed one.
[00:37:09.168 --> 00:37:11.189]  Biden had been up there giving that speech.
[00:37:11.749 --> 00:37:16.091]  Men in white coats would have interrupted him and carted him off and put him in a padded wagon.
[00:37:16.531 --> 00:37:25.335]  I thought today I would wake up and the TV would be full of doctors talking about Donald Trump's cognitive decline.
[00:37:25.415 --> 00:37:30.137]  I thought it would be full of Republicans hanging their heads in shame like Democrats did.
[00:37:30.557 --> 00:37:32.678]  Joe Biden had a bad 90-minute debate.
[00:37:33.178 --> 00:37:34.499]  He said it's one episode.
[00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:35.759]  That's what we've seen so far.
[00:37:36.059 --> 00:37:42.022]  What we saw yesterday was a replay of Trump's 90-minute constant rallies.
[00:37:42.122 --> 00:37:45.183]  It's too bad the bandage was just over his ear.
[00:37:45.203 --> 00:37:46.364]  It should have been over his mouth.
[00:37:47.604 --> 00:37:49.005]  Here's the question that I have on that.
[00:37:49.835 --> 00:37:51.176]  These two men are both elderly.
[00:37:51.736 --> 00:38:00.603]  Donald Trump is an elderly man who, for whatever reason, was given nine seconds to take an iconic photo op during an active shooter situation.
[00:38:00.883 --> 00:38:03.025]  Weird situation, we'll figure that out one day.
[00:38:03.045 --> 00:38:11.952]  But his survival of that and bouncing right back and going right to his convention is being conveyed in the media world as a sign of strength.
[00:38:12.572 --> 00:38:18.296]  This current president of the United States is 81 years old and has COVID.
[00:38:18.816 --> 00:38:21.018]  Should he be fine in a couple of days?
[00:38:21.558 --> 00:38:23.499]  Doesn't that convey exactly the same thing?
[00:38:23.839 --> 00:38:30.263]   That he's strong enough, older than Trump, to have gotten something that used to really be The globalists are desperate.
[00:38:30.283 --> 00:38:32.024]  They think AI is going to save them.
[00:38:31.844 --> 00:38:36.364]   he does fine out of it and comes back and is able to do rallies, isn't that exactly
[00:38:36.364 --> 00:38:37.364]  the same?
[00:38:37.364 --> 00:38:38.364]  It should.
[00:38:38.364 --> 00:38:39.364]  I mean, it's not exactly the same.
[00:38:39.364 --> 00:38:45.523]   It's not the same incident, but it's an elderly man coming through out of an illness.
[00:38:45.523 --> 00:38:50.284]  It should.
[00:38:50.284 --> 00:38:53.362]  The globalists are desperate.
[00:38:53.362 --> 00:38:54.963]  They think AI is going to save them.
[00:38:54.963 --> 00:38:57.083]  We have billions of people.
[00:38:57.083 --> 00:39:01.844]   And if a large portion of those billions of people know what's going on and tell the truth
[00:39:01.844 --> 00:39:07.043]   and differentiate between globalist propaganda and the truth, it's over for them.
[00:39:07.043 --> 00:39:17.043]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:39:09.472 --> 00:39:14.134]  I cannot express to you how historic the moment is we're in right now and how dangerous it is.
[00:39:14.814 --> 00:39:17.836]  Trump to hold first campaign rally after assassination attempt.
[00:39:19.136 --> 00:39:22.778]  People have been lined up since last night to be part of it.
[00:39:24.761 --> 00:39:26.342]  It's going to be in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[00:39:26.462 --> 00:39:27.682]  He'll be there in a few hours.
[00:39:28.383 --> 00:39:32.885]  There's reportedly a hundred thousand people, local news say, trying to get in the building.
[00:39:33.265 --> 00:39:37.307]  Joe Biden can't fill a Volkswagen, a phone booth.
[00:39:38.747 --> 00:39:41.789]  But they want us to believe that he is set to win this thing.
[00:39:41.969 --> 00:39:42.269]  All right.
[00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:46.751]  Let's talk about where Trump is politically right now and what's happened.
[00:39:48.732 --> 00:39:51.313]  Because again, it's just like I said with Ivan Reikland.
[00:39:52.879 --> 00:39:54.519]  And you guys downloaded that report, right?
[00:39:54.539 --> 00:39:57.560]  Me being attacked for saying the best case scenario is Trump's killed.
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:58.720]  You guys have that, right?
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.561]  May I send it to you again?
[00:40:02.621 --> 00:40:03.061]  No problem.
[00:40:04.481 --> 00:40:05.401]  I will just send it again.
[00:40:05.421 --> 00:40:08.042]  Because I want to talk about this.
[00:40:08.062 --> 00:40:08.822]  This is a big deal.
[00:40:10.922 --> 00:40:12.643]  Yeah, it's, uh, please kill him.
[00:40:12.943 --> 00:40:14.723]  Alex Jones begged for Trump assassination.
[00:40:15.903 --> 00:40:20.724]  I sent it to, uh... Okay, I'm gonna go to that in a little while.
[00:40:22.005 --> 00:40:24.246]  But notice they show like five second clips here.
[00:40:24.487 --> 00:40:25.988]  And by the way, this is on national news.
[00:40:26.728 --> 00:40:32.592]  This is just a YouTube clip I got, but it's on mainstream corporate TV everywhere that Jones hoped Trump would die.
[00:40:33.993 --> 00:40:36.955]  And notice they show like five second clips out of context.
[00:40:37.015 --> 00:40:38.295]  I said, we don't want Trump to die.
[00:40:38.776 --> 00:40:39.856]  They're going to try to kill him.
[00:40:40.737 --> 00:40:43.859]  Former Green Beret, DIA, you know, General Flynn guy.
[00:40:47.199 --> 00:40:49.740]  And we're saying don't kill him.
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.020]  It'll be worse for you.
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.580]  So they don't kill him.
[00:40:54.181 --> 00:40:58.262]  And then they spend that on the national news like, oh, maybe the guy was a Trump supporter.
[00:40:58.862 --> 00:41:00.382]  Listen to Alex wanted to do this.
[00:41:00.942 --> 00:41:01.342]  It's like.
[00:41:03.023 --> 00:41:07.524]  In Dirty Harry, where he's aiming the gun at the bad guy, he says, go ahead, punk, make my day.
[00:41:08.516 --> 00:41:11.098]  It's like having nuclear weapons so Russia doesn't go to war with us.
[00:41:11.678 --> 00:41:13.600]  It's the mutually assured destruction.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.302]  No one in their right mind thinks we want Trump dead.
[00:41:16.762 --> 00:41:18.244]  No one in their right mind thinks we want this to happen.
[00:41:18.504 --> 00:41:26.530]  But imagine what would have unfolded if Trump would have been killed last Saturday, seven days ago.
[00:41:28.231 --> 00:41:29.592]  Imagine the civil unrest.
[00:41:30.033 --> 00:41:34.036]  Now the globalists would capitalize on that and stage a false flag.
[00:41:36.858 --> 00:41:38.099]  War game that in your own mind.
[00:41:39.133 --> 00:41:46.138]  So the idea, to use a Biden quote, that I want Trump dead.
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:54.044]  And again, if you want to watch the full Ivan Rehnquist interview months ago, we said, they're going to try to assassinate him.
[00:41:54.084 --> 00:41:54.825]  We got to stop it.
[00:41:55.245 --> 00:41:56.846]  But if they do, they're totally screwed.
[00:41:56.886 --> 00:42:00.449]  You better not do it because that makes it 10 times worse for you, which it does.
[00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:03.932]  Imagine if they would have killed him last Saturday, seven days ago.
[00:42:05.373 --> 00:42:09.275]  Imagine what would have unfolded and come out of that and the hysteria and the craziness.
[00:42:09.656 --> 00:42:16.140]  And then the public would believe that Trump supporters were really blowing up the White House with a truck bomb or any of this.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.961]  They'd bring us into full martial law.
[00:42:18.321 --> 00:42:19.542]  We have been accurate.
[00:42:20.162 --> 00:42:22.363]  And we have told the establishment, don't try this.
[00:42:22.623 --> 00:42:23.924]  But they did and they failed.
[00:42:24.184 --> 00:42:25.485]  So we get the best of both worlds.
[00:42:26.005 --> 00:42:27.066]  Trump is still alive.
[00:42:29.408 --> 00:42:31.649]  But they have the effect.
[00:42:34.024 --> 00:42:39.184]   trying to kill him. So it's like they killed Trump but they didn't. So we've
[00:42:39.184 --> 00:42:44.824]   got Trump still alive with the worst-case scenario for them where they
[00:42:44.824 --> 00:42:51.063]   tried to kill him. And this is perfect. Cue this up. When I went months ago and
[00:42:51.063 --> 00:42:56.264]   watched Civil War, this 350 million dollar production, it's all about the
[00:42:56.264 --> 00:43:00.703]   left taking over America. There's a Trump character. They go in. The black woman
[00:43:00.703 --> 00:43:03.984]   kills the Trump character at the end. It's all racially based.
[00:43:04.451 --> 00:43:08.374]  This is what they're pre-programming, what they're fantasizing about, what they want.
[00:43:08.394 --> 00:43:11.356]  So get that Civil War clip you just showed with audio ready.
[00:43:12.376 --> 00:43:17.700]  I was literally thinking of the Civil War clip, and they already had it up before I told them to get it.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:18.981]  We'll do that after.
[00:43:20.956 --> 00:43:27.958]  Let's air the leftist who has given talking points, so this is like CIA stuff, to the PR firms they give them.
[00:43:28.539 --> 00:43:34.981]  The CIA goes to PR firm, PR firm puts it out to a thousand influencers, 10,000 influencers, they then repeat the same script.
[00:43:35.201 --> 00:43:37.502]  Oh, you don't get COVID, you take the shot.
[00:43:37.682 --> 00:43:39.382]  Oh, the COVID, you know, the shot's totally safe.
[00:43:39.983 --> 00:43:41.043]  All the same parents.
[00:43:41.603 --> 00:43:43.924]  Take it, edit them together, them all repeating the same thing.
[00:43:46.297 --> 00:44:05.369]   And so they wanted to kill Trump, and we're going to use that for civil war, and instead he survived, so we have your failure to kill him on top of your indictments and civil suits and taking him off the ballot and everything, and so the worst case scenario The Worst Case Scenario.
[00:44:05.429 --> 00:44:06.249]  I'm going to say it eight times.
[00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:07.790]  The Worst Case Scenario.
[00:44:10.671 --> 00:44:11.692]  The Worst Case Scenario.
[00:44:14.313 --> 00:44:15.254]  The Worst Case Scenario.
[00:44:15.494 --> 00:44:16.434]  The Worst Case Scenario.
[00:44:16.454 --> 00:44:17.235]  Let's do it ten times.
[00:44:17.655 --> 00:44:18.595]  Worst Case Scenario.
[00:44:18.915 --> 00:44:19.756]  Worst Case Scenario.
[00:44:20.416 --> 00:44:21.697]  Hell, let's do it 10 more times.
[00:44:22.017 --> 00:44:23.298]  Because I want to get it through your head.
[00:44:23.639 --> 00:44:31.104]  Worst case scenario, worst case scenario, worst case scenario, worst case scenario, worst case scenario, worst case, worst case, worst case, worst case, worst case.
[00:44:31.325 --> 00:44:31.985]  Hell, let's keep going.
[00:44:32.225 --> 00:44:38.210]  Worst case scenario, worst case scenario, worst case... Because, ladies and gentlemen, they are desperate.
[00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:40.191]  They have nothing else they can do.
[00:44:40.592 --> 00:44:41.312]  And he lived.
[00:44:41.612 --> 00:44:42.413]  He survived.
[00:44:42.453 --> 00:44:43.334]  It was totally real.
[00:44:43.634 --> 00:44:44.595]  Anybody could see that.
[00:44:47.475 --> 00:44:55.619]  And so now they had the aftermath of his death ready to truck bomb black churches or black colleges or whatever they were going to do.
[00:44:57.359 --> 00:44:58.040]  But he's alive.
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:00.941]  He had a speech of unity Thursday night.
[00:45:02.262 --> 00:45:04.943]  So they don't know how to respond to that.
[00:45:08.844 --> 00:45:11.165]  It's just a beyond critical moment.
[00:45:11.185 --> 00:45:21.051]   And then Joy Behar and The rest of them are up there saying it's fake, or Anna Navarro wishing he got shot in the mouth.
[00:45:21.491 --> 00:45:24.133]  Shoots you in the mouth, it hits the spinal cord, you're dead.
[00:45:25.474 --> 00:45:28.055]  So, oh, nobody really tried to kill Trump.
[00:45:28.375 --> 00:45:30.717]  This is all fake, but we wish he was dead.
[00:45:31.157 --> 00:45:32.238]  Man, we wish he was dead.
[00:45:32.478 --> 00:45:33.439]  The public, take that clip out.
[00:45:33.579 --> 00:45:34.880]  Alex Jones wishes Trump was dead.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.260]  No, I'm talking about them.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:44.766]  You want to see the compilations I heard all week of CIA and congressmen and senators and bureaucrats saying kill Trump, CIA's going to kill Trump?
[00:45:45.964 --> 00:45:46.724]  They'll take that clip.
[00:45:46.984 --> 00:45:47.925]  Jones says kill Trump.
[00:45:48.625 --> 00:45:49.985]  Why is the Secret Service not here?
[00:45:52.006 --> 00:45:54.986]  Boy, I hope they come like they did it when Trump was first in.
[00:45:55.487 --> 00:45:57.647]  When Trump told them to come to me and I said, Trump, you're under threat.
[00:45:58.067 --> 00:45:59.648]  Democrats are on TV saying kill you.
[00:45:59.948 --> 00:46:01.668]  And I gave the Secret Service a big compilation.
[00:46:01.988 --> 00:46:03.309]  Boy, I hope the Secret Service shows up.
[00:46:03.529 --> 00:46:04.529]  I'm going to sit their ass down.
[00:46:04.549 --> 00:46:05.569]  I'm going to show them the threat.
[00:46:05.749 --> 00:46:07.270]  But they're not here because they already know this.
[00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:09.772]  And they already know their bosses did a standout.
[00:46:10.132 --> 00:46:11.374]  We don't want Trump dead.
[00:46:11.694 --> 00:46:14.897]  We want the transgender cult attacking our kids to be stopped.
[00:46:15.198 --> 00:46:16.419]  We want the open borders to be stopped.
[00:46:16.439 --> 00:46:17.600]  The evaluation of the dollar stopped.
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:18.801]  World War III stopped.
[00:46:19.302 --> 00:46:21.925]  The destruction of our republic stopped.
[00:46:23.466 --> 00:46:24.267]  That's what we want.
[00:46:24.768 --> 00:46:25.608]  That's what we demand.
[00:46:25.929 --> 00:46:26.710]  That's what we seek.
[00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.851]  That's what we're looking for.
[00:46:30.891 --> 00:46:34.053]  So here's one of the deep staters on YouTube, who's just one of these people.
[00:46:34.073 --> 00:46:36.834]  This is literally, without even looking, I got sent like 20 of these.
[00:46:37.114 --> 00:46:37.635]  It's everywhere.
[00:46:38.175 --> 00:46:40.716]  Alex Jones says, best case scenario, Trump dies.
[00:46:41.657 --> 00:46:45.038]  For us, in the sick extrapolation out.
[00:46:45.359 --> 00:46:46.339]  I said I don't want that.
[00:46:46.679 --> 00:46:47.259]  It's terrible.
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:48.860]  But I said, don't kill him.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.141]  That won't work.
[00:46:50.481 --> 00:46:51.862]  So they won't kill him.
[00:46:53.721 --> 00:46:55.344]  Obviously we don't want Trump dead.
[00:46:55.605 --> 00:46:57.008]  Obviously we're not saying that.
[00:46:57.268 --> 00:46:58.410]  This is preposterous.
[00:46:58.931 --> 00:47:00.895]  But that's how dumb they think their viewers are.
[00:47:01.156 --> 00:47:01.617]  Here's the clip.
[00:47:02.782 --> 00:47:18.793]  So much has been made of the attempted assassination of former President Trump, and you have different varieties and flavors of conspiracy theories out there, and then you have the idea of just rank incompetence on the part of the Secret Service, and that's why it almost succeeded, but it didn't succeed.
[00:47:19.053 --> 00:47:33.224]   Midas Touch went back and pulled up this very, very bizarre Alex Jones clip from about six months ago, and listen to what he says here about The potential of Trump assassination attempt and what it would mean.
[00:47:33.064 --> 00:47:34.064]  Watch this.
[00:47:34.064 --> 00:47:39.024]   And this is a message directly to every single person on the deep state target list.
[00:47:39.024 --> 00:47:45.064]   My assessment, Ivan Reikland's assessment that if you assassinate any political presidential
[00:47:45.064 --> 00:47:48.784]  candidate, whether it's RFK, whether it's Trump, guess what?
[00:47:49.195 --> 00:47:52.856]  America will do the following immediately.
[00:47:53.317 --> 00:47:58.538]  They will respond in kind and they know who you are because we've created the list.
[00:47:59.018 --> 00:48:00.579]  And that's a major Rubicon.
[00:48:00.599 --> 00:48:01.279]  They should know that.
[00:48:01.459 --> 00:48:02.099]  Immediately.
[00:48:02.499 --> 00:48:07.260]  You're going to see immediate response and there are only a few buildings in Washington D.C.
[00:48:07.521 --> 00:48:09.421]  that they will probably do that.
[00:48:10.261 --> 00:48:12.242]  Well, I hope that's not the case, but these people are crazy.
[00:48:12.982 --> 00:48:24.217]   And having said that, if they do that, Option two, behind Trump, is gonna be so much better for us, and so much worse for them.
[00:48:24.237 --> 00:48:34.139]  I was about to say, if they kill him, that's best case scenario, from a sick level, from a sick level beating him, oh please kill him, which I don't, I mean, but it's so good after that.
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:35.220]  Oh, what?
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:41.521]  It's gonna be the best cleansing and the fastest cleansing that we've ever seen in my lifetime.
[00:48:41.862 --> 00:48:47.123]  Okay, is the argument this guy's making is, oh if you kill him, we get to like purge the country?
[00:48:47.896 --> 00:48:48.337]  Of liberals?
[00:48:49.138 --> 00:48:49.778]  Is that the argument?
[00:48:49.998 --> 00:48:55.645]  Or, if I'm being kind, he's saying we get to purge the country of quote-unquote the deep state?
[00:48:57.006 --> 00:48:58.147]  What is the argument he's making there?
[00:48:58.187 --> 00:49:00.669]  And you heard Alex Jones say, please kill him.
[00:49:00.729 --> 00:49:01.409]  All right, one more time.
[00:49:01.449 --> 00:49:01.810]  Here we go.
[00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:08.114]  Option two behind Trump is going to be so much better for us and so much worse for them.
[00:49:08.134 --> 00:49:10.976]  I was about to say, if they kill him, that's best case scenario.
[00:49:11.637 --> 00:49:13.458]  Best case scenario if they kill him.
[00:49:13.638 --> 00:49:14.639]  From a sick level.
[00:49:15.019 --> 00:49:16.320]  From a sick level beating him.
[00:49:16.661 --> 00:49:17.461]  Oh, please kill him.
[00:49:17.501 --> 00:49:20.443]  Which I don't, I mean, but it's so good after that.
[00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:21.784]  Why is it so good after that?
[00:49:21.804 --> 00:49:23.065]  Look, these guys are Trump supporters.
[00:49:23.085 --> 00:49:23.806]  Let's call it what it is.
[00:49:23.826 --> 00:49:24.727]  Let's call a spade a spade.
[00:49:25.842 --> 00:49:27.464]  I was a Bernie Sanders supporter when he was running in 2016.
[00:49:27.744 --> 00:49:33.749]  I would never in a million years say, please kill him, because after that it's great.
[00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:34.330]  How?
[00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:35.411]  How is it great?
[00:49:35.431 --> 00:49:39.895]  First of all, the killing in and of itself is bad by its very nature, by definition.
[00:49:40.415 --> 00:49:41.456]  But how does it get better after that?
[00:49:41.917 --> 00:49:45.720]  What does he think that will lead to the flourishing of Trumpism if Trump is killed?
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:46.321]  Is that the idea?
[00:49:47.091 --> 00:49:53.136]  It's going to be the best cleansing and the fastest cleansing that we've ever seen in my lifetime.
[00:49:53.336 --> 00:49:54.336]  Okay, that's a scary comment.
[00:49:54.356 --> 00:49:57.779]  Because again, I think he's either talking about like a cleansing of Democrats and liberals.
[00:49:58.099 --> 00:49:59.761]  Like, hey, we finally get to fight back!
[00:49:59.801 --> 00:50:00.081]  Yeah!
[00:50:00.121 --> 00:50:07.066]  I think it's either that or it's a cleansing of like the deep state, which to them means anybody slightly left of Attila the Hun who works in the government.
[00:50:07.546 --> 00:50:09.528]  Either way, the cleansing word is not good.
[00:50:09.568 --> 00:50:12.350]  And also what Alex Jones is saying is his best case scenario if this happens.
[00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:13.010]  ISS?
[00:50:14.161 --> 00:50:23.588]  With almost certainty, with the highest level of confidence, that if they assassinate Trump, it is so game over for them, and it's going to be so fast.
[00:50:23.889 --> 00:50:25.049]  How is it game over for them?
[00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:28.732]  Let's say for Democrats, for liberals, how is it game over if Trump is assassinated?
[00:50:28.752 --> 00:50:32.035]  By the way, murder is wrong, assassination attempts are wrong, let's be clear.
[00:50:32.355 --> 00:50:33.656]  But why is that game over?
[00:50:34.697 --> 00:50:38.440]  How would a dead Donald Trump lead to the thriving of Trumpism?
[00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:40.930]  How would that happen?
[00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:41.831]  Who's going to fill his shoes?
[00:50:41.871 --> 00:50:42.791]  What, Don Jr.
[00:50:42.871 --> 00:50:43.371]  is going to step in?
[00:50:43.511 --> 00:50:44.732]  Barron is going to step in his shoes?
[00:50:45.012 --> 00:50:46.452]  Ron DeSantis is going to step in?
[00:50:46.472 --> 00:50:47.353]  Who's going to step into his shoes?
[00:50:47.833 --> 00:50:48.173]  J.D.
[00:50:48.193 --> 00:50:48.493]  Vance?
[00:50:50.634 --> 00:50:51.154]  I don't understand.
[00:50:51.234 --> 00:50:51.634]  How would this?
[00:50:51.794 --> 00:50:55.036]  Now look, here's the point that these guys would never contend with.
[00:50:57.276 --> 00:51:02.258]  They think Trump is like this special, unique character in history.
[00:51:02.578 --> 00:51:06.140]  And he represents something that's its own.
[00:51:07.128 --> 00:51:22.687]  The fact of the matter is, the way he governed was just like George W. Bush, who Trump hates, just like Dick Cheney, who Trump hates, just like Mitt Romney would have governed, he also hates him, the idea that it's unique, it's special, it's populist, it's not populist.
[00:51:22.927 --> 00:51:23.728]  He's a fake populist.
[00:51:23.889 --> 00:51:24.830]  We lost 200,000 jobs under Trump.
[00:51:26.564 --> 00:51:28.765]  These guys like to pretend like Trump is anti-war.
[00:51:29.326 --> 00:51:30.106]  He's not anti-war.
[00:51:30.206 --> 00:51:31.267]  He increased drone strikes by 432%.
[00:51:31.507 --> 00:51:33.928]  He kept us in Iraq.
[00:51:34.329 --> 00:51:35.489]  He kept us in Afghanistan.
[00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:39.812]  He, uh, destroyed... All of that is lies, and all of you know that.
[00:51:40.552 --> 00:51:42.013]  So, that's how desperate they are.
[00:51:42.033 --> 00:51:44.075]  With little edited clips like, we want Trump dead.
[00:51:44.115 --> 00:51:45.555]  We're saying, don't kill Trump.
[00:51:46.236 --> 00:51:49.598]  It goes much worse for... It goes much worse for you.
[00:51:52.546 --> 00:51:53.688]  Yeah, we're done with the club, guys.
[00:51:54.448 --> 00:51:55.089]  We're done with the club.
[00:51:55.710 --> 00:52:03.700]  So, imagine, ladies and gentlemen... I'm seeing a lot of running around in the studio.
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:04.501]  Are we on air right now?
[00:52:05.842 --> 00:52:06.383]  Okay, we're good?
[00:52:06.403 --> 00:52:06.623]  Alright.
[00:52:07.204 --> 00:52:08.366]  So, I just want to kill the club.
[00:52:08.486 --> 00:52:09.026]  I'm done.
[00:52:09.046 --> 00:52:09.567]  Listen to the club.
[00:52:09.667 --> 00:52:10.708]  We're moving on from the club now.
[00:52:11.755 --> 00:52:15.158]  Guys, we're obviously saying, what would have happened if they killed Trump?
[00:52:15.918 --> 00:52:18.180]  We should be talking about that so they don't do it.
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:20.582]  Like, it gets worse for them if they kill Trump.
[00:52:20.602 --> 00:52:21.422]  We don't want Trump dead.
[00:52:21.462 --> 00:52:22.883]  We're saying, don't kill him.
[00:52:22.923 --> 00:52:32.050]  It's like, again, in that classic Millis movie, Dirty Harry, where he's pointing the gun at the punk, and he says, go ahead, punk.
[00:52:32.691 --> 00:52:33.291]  Make my day.
[00:52:33.351 --> 00:52:34.952]  He doesn't want the punk to do it.
[00:52:35.253 --> 00:52:37.514]  He's saying, confidently, you better give up.
[00:52:39.896 --> 00:52:40.937]  And that's what we're saying.
[00:52:42.691 --> 00:52:47.372]  To these people and they try to spin it like we want Trump dead and we're going to kill Trump?
[00:52:48.493 --> 00:52:50.293]  That's how delusional they are.
[00:52:50.353 --> 00:52:52.394]  So let's look at some of these headlines right now.
[00:52:53.974 --> 00:52:56.455]  Republican Party is Trump's now.
[00:52:56.835 --> 00:53:00.456]  Critics wary his quest for power will go unchecked.
[00:53:00.896 --> 00:53:02.456]  All he wants to do is turn the economy back on.
[00:53:03.136 --> 00:53:04.857]  He didn't do any persecution when he was in office.
[00:53:05.217 --> 00:53:05.717]  They did it.
[00:53:06.717 --> 00:53:08.318]  Everything they accuse Trump of, they've done.
[00:53:10.238 --> 00:53:16.646]   Democrat pollster Doug Schoen On Trump's Republican National Convention speech, the election may already be over.
[00:53:18.567 --> 00:53:19.408]  Well, of course it's over.
[00:53:20.168 --> 00:53:21.169]  Trump's 30 points ahead.
[00:53:21.309 --> 00:53:22.230]  They're just going to try to spin it.
[00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:25.992]  Tulsi Gabbard's absolutely savage as Kamala Harris for questioning J.D.
[00:53:26.092 --> 00:53:27.193]  Manchin's loyalty to our country.
[00:53:28.393 --> 00:53:31.115]  Hulk Hogan coming out and saying, I was a coward.
[00:53:31.395 --> 00:53:32.256]  I've always loved Trump.
[00:53:32.476 --> 00:53:33.657]  We've all got to be all in.
[00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:35.478]  He's just emblematic of that.
[00:53:36.218 --> 00:53:42.382]  Rhino, Utah Governor Spencer Cox does a massive U-turn and endorses Trump campaign.
[00:53:44.147 --> 00:53:45.708]  The rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[00:53:46.088 --> 00:53:50.611]  Tucker Carlson hails Trump as bravest man in RNC speech after telling Stafford, I hate him.
[00:53:50.932 --> 00:53:51.912]  That was out of context.
[00:53:51.952 --> 00:53:53.974]  He says, I love Trump and also hate him sometimes.
[00:53:53.994 --> 00:53:59.798]  And we're going to air Tucker Carlson's speech and Eric Trump.
[00:54:00.218 --> 00:54:01.279]  You know, I love Don.
[00:54:01.299 --> 00:54:02.099]  He's really smart and good.
[00:54:02.119 --> 00:54:07.002]  But let me tell you, Eric Trump's speech was so powerful and it scares the power structure.
[00:54:10.585 --> 00:54:12.046]  So it just goes on from there.
[00:54:13.663 --> 00:54:15.164]  You have the despair of the Never Trumpers.
[00:54:17.206 --> 00:54:18.026]  They don't know what to do.
[00:54:19.427 --> 00:54:20.528]  They're in full panic mode.
[00:54:21.009 --> 00:54:33.858]  And then you've got Biden, who's refusing to step down because he's so incredibly arrogant and because his family is in control.
[00:54:36.721 --> 00:54:39.523]  So, what's coming next?
[00:54:40.964 --> 00:54:41.965]  What's going to happen now?
[00:54:43.049 --> 00:54:44.370]  We have to be discussing that.
[00:54:44.410 --> 00:54:46.250]  We have to be debating that.
[00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:54.674]  We have to be looking at what will this deep state that is in so much trouble do now that everything they've done has failed.
[00:54:55.394 --> 00:54:56.735]  And I said cyber attacks.
[00:54:57.955 --> 00:55:02.957]  I said false flags, expanded wars, new assassination attempts.
[00:55:04.038 --> 00:55:07.339]  This is not hard to figure out.
[00:55:08.799 --> 00:55:09.500]  Not hard at all.
[00:55:10.342 --> 00:55:13.884]  We are not in a normal period in American history right now.
[00:55:13.944 --> 00:55:15.906]  We are in grave danger.
[00:55:16.706 --> 00:55:18.467]  And the good news is, people are getting that.
[00:55:18.507 --> 00:55:22.410]  So coming up tonight, in Michigan, Trump's going to speak.
[00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:23.770]  We should be praying for him right now.
[00:55:24.851 --> 00:55:25.892]  Because there's no telling.
[00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:29.252]  But the deep shit's gonna pull because they're so desperate.
[00:55:29.632 --> 00:55:30.913]  They could do anything.
[00:55:31.173 --> 00:55:32.294]  They're all over TV.
[00:55:32.834 --> 00:55:35.677]  Former CIA deputy directors, you name it, saying we're gonna kill Trump.
[00:55:36.297 --> 00:55:41.421]  And then they try to kill him, and they go, oh my god, he staged it, it's all fake, but we sure need to get rid of him.
[00:55:43.863 --> 00:55:46.445]  They're just thinking in the immediate moment, how do they keep their power?
[00:55:46.465 --> 00:55:49.267]  They're not thinking about how the world has turned against them.
[00:55:50.288 --> 00:55:51.368]  And how much trouble they're in.
[00:55:51.809 --> 00:55:53.130]  And then you've got these congressmen.
[00:55:55.179 --> 00:55:56.840]  There's a report on this Friday I never got to.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:03.045]  Let's pull this up.
[00:56:03.766 --> 00:56:09.210]  That's where they are.
[00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:10.351]  I can play the compilations.
[00:56:10.411 --> 00:56:12.673]  I play them Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[00:56:13.393 --> 00:56:14.694]  You want to see the compilations?
[00:56:15.035 --> 00:56:17.917]  I've got so many clips, I can't even play them all here.
[00:56:18.888 --> 00:56:20.569]  They're the ones that control the government.
[00:56:20.969 --> 00:56:22.550]  They're the ones that know the people have woken up.
[00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:24.531]  They're the ones that know the people aren't going along with them.
[00:56:24.771 --> 00:56:28.233]  And they're saying they're going to kill President Trump.
[00:56:30.234 --> 00:56:33.176]  Because he stands against a program of austerity.
[00:56:35.417 --> 00:56:35.997]  Found that clip.
[00:56:38.339 --> 00:56:40.260]  And then we've got Harris.
[00:56:42.347 --> 00:56:47.814]  Agrees to last minute zoom call with Democrat mega donors as largest super PAC abandons Joe Biden.
[00:56:48.314 --> 00:56:49.836]  Joe Biden, they're trying to force him out.
[00:56:50.116 --> 00:56:51.057]  Maybe he hangs on.
[00:56:51.358 --> 00:56:52.940]  I love watching our enemies fight with each other.
[00:56:54.056 --> 00:56:56.577]  Biden family starts discussing his possible exit plan.
[00:56:57.498 --> 00:56:57.818]  2024 race.
[00:56:58.158 --> 00:56:58.778]  NBC News.
[00:56:59.619 --> 00:57:00.999]  NBC News journalists.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:04.201]  Resentment growing between Biden team and Obama people.
[00:57:04.621 --> 00:57:05.702]  Biden feels betrayed.
[00:57:06.042 --> 00:57:10.164]  I told you two weeks ago that Obama's surrogates were trying to get rid of Biden.
[00:57:10.364 --> 00:57:10.824]  Oh no!
[00:57:11.344 --> 00:57:12.405]  Obama likes Biden.
[00:57:12.485 --> 00:57:13.185]  No he doesn't!
[00:57:15.286 --> 00:57:22.130]  Biden pushes party unity as he resists calls to step aside since he'll return to campaign next week.
[00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.590]  Let's see.
[00:57:24.073 --> 00:57:26.355]  Behind the scenes is Joe Biden lost control of the Democratic Party.
[00:57:26.915 --> 00:57:31.139]  Is he going to leave or is he trying to get more agreements for money after he leaves?
[00:57:31.519 --> 00:57:31.999]  Blue poll!
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:36.023]  Look and see Joe Biden booted out of the election race and refuses to go.
[00:57:37.864 --> 00:57:40.246]  The Republicans did the same thing with alternate electorate.
[00:57:41.347 --> 00:57:42.088]  Alternate electors.
[00:57:42.648 --> 00:57:44.910]  So did Obama.
[00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:45.931]  So did JFK.
[00:57:46.331 --> 00:57:48.313]  Trump was indicted for this.
[00:57:48.993 --> 00:57:52.016]  Other people were indicted for this and now they're openly doing it.
[00:57:53.609 --> 00:58:01.131]  Republicans are considering a good conscious loophole, or Democrats, excuse me, that would enable them to vote for a new candidate.
[00:58:01.151 --> 00:58:08.794]  DNC Delegate and Political Scientist Elaine Kamarick spoke with a few delegates on Friday morning.
[00:58:10.714 --> 00:58:11.394]  Here we go!
[00:58:11.675 --> 00:58:20.937]  DNC Rules Committee outlines new voting process will move to virtual roll call to nominate Joe Biden in order to prevent embarrassing public displays.
[00:58:21.177 --> 00:58:26.418]   They're having a virtual Event next month in just a few weeks in Chicago because it's
[00:58:26.418 --> 00:58:28.989]  so embarrassing to them. What's happening?
[00:58:28.989 --> 00:58:37.849]   America spent years turning Kamala Harris in a joke. No, she did herself in the end. She might get the last laugh
[00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:44.000]   slate Obama tells allies Biden's path to winning reelection has
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:51.070]   greatly diminished She's got this big criminal network that knows the whole
[00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:56.674]   house of cards has come down and they don't know what to do They are totally confused.
[00:58:59.156 --> 00:59:06.422]  They've got different deep state operators telling them different plans they ought to pull, but everything they pulled has failed.
[00:59:06.702 --> 00:59:09.184]  They should give up and roll over and get out of the way.
[00:59:10.305 --> 00:59:11.466]  Here's that clip we mentioned.
[00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:19.077]  Congressman with oversight of the Secret Service says Trump needs to be eliminated prior to the assassination attempt on his life.
[00:59:19.117 --> 00:59:19.438]  Here it is.
[00:59:20.649 --> 00:59:23.411]  Announced that Trump needed to be, quote, eliminated.
[00:59:24.091 --> 00:59:24.351]  Watch.
[00:59:25.232 --> 00:59:32.136]  It's just unquestionable at this point that that man cannot see public office again.
[00:59:32.316 --> 00:59:40.521]  He is not only unfit, he is destructive to our democracy, and he has to be eliminated.
[00:59:41.481 --> 00:59:48.385]  So that is a sitting member of Congress, one of the more influential ones, with oversight of the Secret Service, saying Trump simply cannot win.
[00:59:48.425 --> 00:59:49.586]  He has to be eliminated.
[00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:54.712]  And Joe Biden's spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, just sits there and nods.
[00:59:55.372 --> 00:59:56.373]  It's psychotic.
[00:59:58.134 --> 01:00:00.275]  We often hear a lot about dangerous rhetoric.
[01:00:01.156 --> 01:00:05.279]  Most of the time, that term is applied to things that are uncomfortable but true.
[01:00:05.359 --> 01:00:10.022]  It's often called dangerous to point out the racial disparities in violent crime statistics, for example.
[01:00:10.082 --> 01:00:19.709]  But that can't be dangerous because it's A, true, and it's B, not the sort of thing that, once acknowledged, will plausibly bring harm to any person or group.
[01:00:21.001 --> 01:00:39.612]  But the left's decade-long campaign to label Trump a Hitlerian dictator who wants to destroy democracy is actually dangerous because it's A, not true, and it's B, the sort of thing that, if believed, is all but guaranteed to bring about exactly the result we saw on Saturday.
[01:00:40.453 --> 01:00:41.314]  That's the point.
[01:00:42.014 --> 01:00:43.015]  It's why they say it.
[01:00:43.035 --> 01:00:45.016]  I mean, think of it this way.
[01:00:46.607 --> 01:00:54.796]  If Trump really is an evil dictator who wants to destroy America, it would be not only understandable, but in fact morally righteous to kill him.
[01:00:55.657 --> 01:01:01.544]  Which is why it doesn't make any sense for all these leftists to now be expressing grief and claiming that this kind of violence is unacceptable.
[01:01:01.604 --> 01:01:01.944]  Really?
[01:01:02.745 --> 01:01:04.307]  Wait a minute, I thought you said he's Hitler.
[01:01:08.251 --> 01:01:14.215]  But they're also now separately everywhere claiming the assassination attempt was fake with no evidence.
[01:01:14.996 --> 01:01:17.717]  It's on national TV with tens of thousands of witnesses.
[01:01:20.039 --> 01:01:23.061]  Events I've questioned were totally separate from that.
[01:01:23.982 --> 01:01:25.022]  And that's totally natural.
[01:01:25.423 --> 01:01:27.104]  Jussie Smollett didn't have any witnesses.
[01:01:28.365 --> 01:01:30.066]  But we have witnesses to what happened here.
[01:01:30.926 --> 01:01:37.551]  We have all these movies and TV shows and books and programs and mainstream corporate news saying civil war is imminent.
[01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:42.475]  Here's a clip from the movie Civil War out three months ago.
[01:01:45.798 --> 01:01:46.118]  Wait!
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:48.661]  Wait!
[01:01:48.481 --> 01:02:00.840]  I need a coat.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.721]  Don't let him kill me.
[01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:08.840]  Yeah.
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:11.281]  That'll do.
[01:02:11.281 --> 01:02:29.600]  And they kill the evil Trump character.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:38.481]  [Music]
[01:02:38.456 --> 01:02:39.777]  That's your Hollywood fantasy.
[01:02:41.718 --> 01:02:42.938]  But that's not the way it's gonna go.
[01:02:44.599 --> 01:02:46.820]  Because their attempt to set up a civil war failed.
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.381]  Their attempt to kill Trump failed.
[01:02:50.781 --> 01:02:51.942]  And the people see through it.
[01:02:53.339 --> 01:02:59.520]  Now that said, I've been predicting they would do cyber attacks to destabilize things as a test before bigger attacks.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.600]  And now we have update.
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:07.241]  Widespread CrowdStrike outages explain possible election implications.
[01:03:07.301 --> 01:03:09.822]  Really important article from GatewayPundit.com.
[01:03:11.122 --> 01:03:18.563]  They need to force an update to all of the Microsoft systems that are out there immediately.
[01:03:19.123 --> 01:03:22.664]  The question is, why are they doing that?
[01:03:23.387 --> 01:03:24.828]  Here's another headline.
[01:03:25.429 --> 01:03:33.055]  Voting stations in Maricopa County affected by CrowdStrike outage and other voting machines around the country.
[01:03:33.576 --> 01:03:36.899]  I thought they weren't connected to the internet.
[01:03:37.419 --> 01:03:39.121]  Why they indict people that say that.
[01:03:41.963 --> 01:03:42.503]  Flashback.
[01:03:42.604 --> 01:03:56.203]   CrowdStrike, the company behind the Russian hacked email scandal that offered no evidence during investigations behind the IT outages that grounded flights across America Today following the RNC, largest IT outage in history.
[01:03:57.003 --> 01:03:58.624]  They are beta testing all of this.
[01:03:58.644 --> 01:04:09.531]  Yeah, let's play a clip of Klaus Schwab two years ago saying that a cyber attack will make COVID look like just an inconvenience.
[01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:10.992]  This is their plan.
[01:04:11.032 --> 01:04:15.956]  They want lockdowns, they want shutdowns, they want hysteria to change the subject during their coups.
[01:04:15.976 --> 01:04:16.396]  Here's the clip.
[01:04:17.605 --> 01:04:40.316]  We all know, but still pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole.
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:53.397]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack.
[01:04:54.217 --> 01:05:04.956]   to use the COVID-19 crisis as a timely opportunity to reflect on the lessons the cybersecurity community
[01:05:04.956 --> 01:05:13.556]   can draw and improve our preparedness for a potential cyber pandemic.
[01:05:13.556 --> 01:05:18.256]  All right.
[01:05:18.256 --> 01:05:23.137]  So we have other investigations of Incentive Training.
[01:05:23.237 --> 01:05:36.143]  Investment firm that allegedly put options out on 12 million Trump stocks the day before his assassination attempt blames filing error Rothschild, BlackRock, Vanguard, Meta, George Soros, ADL, Cheney family among top investors.
[01:05:37.163 --> 01:05:40.505]  In billions of profits they would have made if Trump would have been killed.
[01:05:41.863 --> 01:05:43.864]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:05:44.324 --> 01:05:57.268]  I want to play a clip from you from the 1990s film, JFK, which is based on real events and real things that happened, with the CIA sitting around talking about how they're going to kill JFK with triangulation in Dallas.
[01:05:57.288 --> 01:06:01.870]  Then we're going to air Greg Reese's report again about two shooters, because it's so important.
[01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:05.191]  So we're going to air this clip, and then back to back, going to Greg Reese's report.
[01:06:05.551 --> 01:06:05.931]  Here it is.
[01:06:08.212 --> 01:06:11.273]  I found myself alone with Dave and this is Leon.
[01:06:12.205 --> 01:06:14.267]  Two of the Cubans and this guy Bertrand.
[01:06:16.008 --> 01:06:17.810]  They pulled out these clippings he'd been carrying around.
[01:06:17.850 --> 01:06:21.033]  You know, he'd been obsessed with Castro and Kennedy for months.
[01:06:21.053 --> 01:06:22.514]  He started in again.
[01:06:22.734 --> 01:06:24.736]  Fucking little ass wife closed down the camps.
[01:06:24.976 --> 01:06:28.660]  Took all our C4 to 10,000 fucking rounds.
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:30.521]  3,000 pounds of gunpowder.
[01:06:30.742 --> 01:06:31.843]  All our fucking weapons.
[01:06:32.343 --> 01:06:32.743]  I tell you.
[01:06:33.704 --> 01:06:33.944]  Shit!
[01:06:34.084 --> 01:06:35.085]  You want a free Cuba?
[01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:36.585]  You gotta whack out the fuckin' beer!
[01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:37.926]  Well, that faggot Kennedy won't let us.
[01:06:38.226 --> 01:06:38.826]  Our hands are empty.
[01:06:38.846 --> 01:06:39.607]  How can we kill him?
[01:06:39.647 --> 01:06:42.648]  The real problem is getting out of Castro has informers on every block.
[01:06:42.828 --> 01:06:43.349]  Bullshit!
[01:06:43.409 --> 01:06:44.669]  I got all kinds of new stuff!
[01:06:44.969 --> 01:06:48.051]  I can show you dozens of fuckin' poison just stickin' in his food!
[01:06:48.191 --> 01:06:49.411]  He'll die in three days!
[01:06:49.852 --> 01:06:50.472]  No trace!
[01:06:50.872 --> 01:06:52.853]  We're gonna put something in his beard, make his beard fall out!
[01:06:52.933 --> 01:06:54.714]  He'll look fuckin' ridiculous without his beard!
[01:06:54.734 --> 01:06:57.075]  The real problem is, is that fuckin' Kennedy.
[01:06:57.695 --> 01:07:00.677]  He's doing all kind of deals con ese hijo de la gran puta de Khrushchev.
[01:07:01.537 --> 01:07:06.942]  An inspired act of God should happen here, okay?
[01:07:07.343 --> 01:07:10.126]  And put a Texan in the White House!
[01:07:10.806 --> 01:07:11.787]  Then Cuba's left.
[01:07:12.708 --> 01:07:13.809]  Dave is drunk now.
[01:07:13.969 --> 01:07:14.930]  Really drunk.
[01:07:14.970 --> 01:07:16.332]  He started in on Kennedy again.
[01:07:16.692 --> 01:07:19.074]  Right in the White House.
[01:07:19.134 --> 01:07:20.436]  I'll stab him right in his fucking heart!
[01:07:21.256 --> 01:07:22.658]  Somebody gotta get rid of this fucker!
[01:07:23.058 --> 01:07:23.699]  Come on, Dave.
[01:07:24.571 --> 01:07:26.172]  You ain't never gonna get that sum, bitch.
[01:07:26.572 --> 01:07:27.672]  No, it won't be long.
[01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:28.452]  Mark my words.
[01:07:29.052 --> 01:07:30.553]  That fucker will get what's coming to him.
[01:07:30.973 --> 01:07:32.053]  It could be blamed on Castro.
[01:07:32.334 --> 01:07:33.614]  The whole country will want to invade Cuba.
[01:07:33.834 --> 01:07:35.154]  All we gotta do is get Kennedy involved.
[01:07:35.234 --> 01:07:36.515]  David, David.
[01:07:36.655 --> 01:07:39.376]  Always some harebrained scheme or another.
[01:07:40.576 --> 01:07:40.796]  Oh!
[01:07:42.357 --> 01:07:43.197]  What have we here?
[01:07:43.217 --> 01:07:44.697]  Let's have some more champagne.
[01:07:45.598 --> 01:07:47.498]  So, what about the secret service?
[01:07:47.738 --> 01:07:48.259]  The cops?
[01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:50.739]  If it's planned right, it's no problem.
[01:07:50.939 --> 01:07:52.120]  Look how close they got with the gold.
[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:54.921]  Eisenhower was always riding around open top.
[01:07:54.981 --> 01:07:57.502]  We need three mechanics in three different locations.
[01:07:58.603 --> 01:08:01.224]  An office building with a high-powered rifle.
[01:08:01.324 --> 01:08:03.745]  Dry annihilation of crossfire, that's the key.
[01:08:04.686 --> 01:08:05.406]  That's the key.
[01:08:06.026 --> 01:08:08.687]  Diversionary shot hits the secret service looking the other way.
[01:08:08.948 --> 01:08:09.048]  Boom!
[01:08:09.068 --> 01:08:10.008]  You get the kill shot.
[01:08:11.709 --> 01:08:13.710]  Crucial thing is one man has to be sacrificed.
[01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:17.030]  Then in the commotion of the crowd, the job gets done.
[01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:19.731]  The others fly out of the country to some place with no extradition.
[01:08:19.892 --> 01:08:21.312]  Why don't we drop this subject?
[01:08:21.612 --> 01:08:28.336]  It's one thing to engage in badanage with all these youngsters, but this sort of thing could be so easily misunderstood.
[01:08:29.376 --> 01:08:30.937]  I didn't think much about it at the time.
[01:08:31.518 --> 01:08:32.338]  It's just bullshit.
[01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:35.520]  You know, everybody likes to make themselves out to be something more than they are.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.781]  Especially in the homosexual underworld.
[01:08:39.382 --> 01:08:42.223]  When they got him, man, I got scared.
[01:08:43.384 --> 01:08:43.964]  Real scared.
[01:08:45.214 --> 01:08:46.116]  That's when I got popped.
[01:08:46.416 --> 01:08:49.921]  You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are gonna be attacked by a lot of different people.
[01:08:50.101 --> 01:08:52.525]  Oh, bring all those motherfuckers on, man.
[01:08:52.565 --> 01:08:54.007]  Bring their college degrees in here.
[01:08:54.027 --> 01:08:54.969]  I got nothing to hide.
[01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:56.030]  You can't buy me.
[01:08:56.230 --> 01:08:56.952]  They can't buy me.
[01:08:56.992 --> 01:08:58.954]  I don't even need this damn parole.
[01:08:58.975 --> 01:09:00.056]  See, this is about the truth coming out.
[01:09:00.977 --> 01:09:02.658]  You a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison.
[01:09:02.678 --> 01:09:05.639]  You don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:06.980]  This ain't about justice.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.201]  You think this about justice?
[01:09:08.281 --> 01:09:09.741]  No, this is about order.
[01:09:10.202 --> 01:09:11.102]  Who rules?
[01:09:11.342 --> 01:09:12.503]  Cause see, fascism is coming back.
[01:09:12.523 --> 01:09:13.603]  Nobody wants to buy you.
[01:09:13.643 --> 01:09:14.744]  Nobody wants to buy you.
[01:09:14.764 --> 01:09:16.245]  No one's promising you a parole here.
[01:09:16.265 --> 01:09:17.825]  I want to be perfectly clear about that.
[01:09:18.546 --> 01:09:19.666]  What I need to know is why.
[01:09:19.686 --> 01:09:20.767]  Alright?
[01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:22.708]  Why are you telling us this?
[01:09:23.370 --> 01:09:27.992]  Because that motherfucker Kennedy stole that motherfucking election.
[01:09:28.032 --> 01:09:28.533]  That's why.
[01:09:28.953 --> 01:09:32.475]  Nixon was gonna be one of the great presidents till Kennedy wrecked this country.
[01:09:32.775 --> 01:09:35.116]  Got niggas all over the place asking for their damn rights.
[01:09:35.156 --> 01:09:37.057]  Why you think we got all this crime now?
[01:09:37.357 --> 01:09:39.839]  He promised those motherfuckers too goddamn much, you ask me.
[01:09:40.179 --> 01:09:40.999]  Revolution's coming.
[01:09:41.039 --> 01:09:41.840]  Bullshit, man.
[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:43.020]  Fascism is coming back.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.081]  I'm gonna tell you this.
[01:09:44.761 --> 01:09:49.964]  The day that communist son of a bitch died was a great day, a great day for this country.
[01:09:50.564 --> 01:09:54.586]  And I just hate to think that they blame it on some silly fucking Oswald.
[01:09:54.626 --> 01:09:56.467]  Didn't know shit anyway, man.
[01:09:57.027 --> 01:09:57.728]  People got to know.
[01:09:57.748 --> 01:09:59.909]  People got to know why he was killed.
[01:10:00.989 --> 01:10:03.471]  Because he was a communist.
[01:10:04.531 --> 01:10:05.192]  Go ahead, man.
[01:10:05.972 --> 01:10:06.252]  Go ahead.
[01:10:06.272 --> 01:10:07.213]  You put me on the stand.
[01:10:07.233 --> 01:10:08.953]  I'll tell the same goddamn story.
[01:10:09.234 --> 01:10:10.694]  Don't matter fuck all to me.
[01:10:12.515 --> 01:10:13.035]  All right, Willie.
[01:10:14.236 --> 01:10:14.696]  Thank you.
[01:10:15.657 --> 01:10:16.337]  We'll be in touch.
[01:10:16.157 --> 01:10:17.157]  All right.
[01:10:17.157 --> 01:10:26.836]  Hey, you know, you're not a bad looking man, Mr. Gowson.
[01:10:26.983 --> 01:10:28.004]  Not bad-looking at all.
[01:10:28.864 --> 01:10:30.206]  I get out of here, I'm gonna come see you.
[01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:31.066]  We got some fun!
[01:10:32.407 --> 01:10:34.349]  None of their testimony's gonna hold up at court, Chief.
[01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:37.792]  Hell, all three of them have reputations lower than a crocodile, Vince.
[01:10:38.273 --> 01:10:39.273]  That bother you, Bill?
[01:10:40.014 --> 01:10:45.599]  I always wondered in court why it is, because a woman's a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
[01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:48.663]  Hey, go find this Clay Bertrand.
[01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:49.984]  Stop by, check around the corner.
[01:10:50.004 --> 01:10:55.767]  And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are gonna solve a case that the Warren Commission couldn't solve?
[01:10:55.788 --> 01:10:58.009]  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
[01:10:58.829 --> 01:10:59.770]  Gee, thanks, boss.
[01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.771]  Good, you're a fighter.
[01:11:01.835 --> 01:11:04.377]  I recommend he's not afraid of bad odds.
[01:11:04.417 --> 01:11:05.537]  Mr. Garrison, how are you?
[01:11:06.378 --> 01:11:07.058]  Remember me?
[01:11:07.419 --> 01:11:07.899]  I surely do.
[01:11:07.939 --> 01:11:08.659]  Did you vote for me?
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:09.880]  I certainly did, sir.
[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:15.004]  We sang together at the Royal O'Leary's, remember?
[01:11:15.264 --> 01:11:21.107]  Oh, yeah, we sang... Garrison, we haven't seen enough of you lately.
[01:11:21.147 --> 01:11:22.148]  Been too busy, Paul.
[01:11:22.889 --> 01:11:25.310]  Elected men, they can't have as much fun as they used to.
[01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:26.511]  It's always nice to see you.
[01:11:26.971 --> 01:11:28.172]  Pleasure to serve you, always.
[01:11:29.073 --> 01:11:30.714]  Bye, little man.
[01:11:34.138 --> 01:11:35.019]  Welcome back, Lou.
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.782]  Paul, you think I could get a martini?
[01:11:39.002 --> 01:11:40.123]  They're waiting for you, sir.
[01:11:41.164 --> 01:11:41.405]  Sir.
[01:11:42.065 --> 01:11:43.246]  Keep that table apart, will you, Paul?
[01:11:44.988 --> 01:11:47.010]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:48.531]  Find out anything on those hobos?
[01:11:49.372 --> 01:11:53.456]  Photographer from the Dallas Times, Harold, got some great shots of them.
[01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:57.099]  Never published.
[01:11:57.119 --> 01:11:58.921]  Can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
[01:12:00.612 --> 01:12:03.194]  They took him to the sheriff's office, and they let him go.
[01:12:03.814 --> 01:12:05.475]  No record of him ever being questioned.
[01:12:06.015 --> 01:12:07.116]  I think you're good looking, Chief.
[01:12:07.616 --> 01:12:09.217]  Any of them look like the hobos you remember?
[01:12:10.158 --> 01:12:11.679]  These two look pretty young.
[01:12:12.199 --> 01:12:18.383]  Not a single frayed collar, cuff, new haircuts, fresh shave, clean hands, new shoe leather.
[01:12:18.883 --> 01:12:20.024]  Well, who the hell are they, then?
[01:12:21.885 --> 01:12:22.465]  Hi, Susie.
[01:12:22.845 --> 01:12:23.666]  Hello.
[01:12:23.786 --> 01:12:24.646]  I'm sorry I'm late.
[01:12:25.167 --> 01:12:26.007]  Alright, let's stop right here.
[01:12:26.027 --> 01:12:27.308]  Everybody should watch JFK again.
[01:12:28.752 --> 01:12:35.637]  You just saw the same group, they're probably their grandkids, do it in Butler, Pennsylvania seven days ago, but they failed.
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:38.840]  They failed.
[01:12:39.881 --> 01:12:40.701]  And now they're screwed.
[01:12:41.322 --> 01:12:43.524]  Because everything they do touches crap now.
[01:12:44.264 --> 01:12:46.386]  Everything they do blows up in front of their faces.
[01:12:47.907 --> 01:12:51.190]  But they're going to double down, make no mistake about that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:51.850 --> 01:12:54.472]  Here's Greg Reese's report on the subject we're covering right now.
[01:12:54.292 --> 01:13:14.171]   I posted on XRollXJones, it needs to go mega viral, here it is.
[01:13:14.582 --> 01:13:18.883]  This ensures success and gives the appearance that there was no conspiracy.
[01:13:19.304 --> 01:13:22.804]  It all gets blamed on a mentally disturbed lone gunman.
[01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:28.026]  But the alleged would-be Trump assassin was willing to go on a suicide mission.
[01:13:28.506 --> 01:13:32.547]  It was an easy shot and he had at least five years of marksmanship training.
[01:13:33.331 --> 01:13:39.914]  The independent work of Asget Industries shows how our young suicide assassin could have been the lone gunman.
[01:13:40.674 --> 01:13:44.396]  But she is restricted to using the limited information we have gotten.
[01:13:45.176 --> 01:13:49.778]  According to the sound analysis of Mike Adams, there were at least three shooters.
[01:13:50.258 --> 01:13:53.019]  I think round one is probably Crooks.
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:55.440]  Round two is Crooks.
[01:13:56.741 --> 01:13:58.301]  Round three is Crooks.
[01:13:59.202 --> 01:14:00.662]  I think these three rounds are Crooks.
[01:14:01.043 --> 01:14:01.503]  It's my guess.
[01:14:03.683 --> 01:14:13.769]  Rounds 4 and 5 are from the same distance as Crooks, but they are not Crooks.
[01:14:13.889 --> 01:14:24.495]  I think rounds 4 and 5, right here, I think rounds 4 and 5 are from a rogue Secret Service team in the building that Crooks was on top of.
[01:14:24.515 --> 01:14:25.516]  So that's my guess.
[01:14:26.276 --> 01:14:29.478]  Round 6 is from medium-range sniper.
[01:14:30.258 --> 01:14:32.700]  Round 7 is long-range sniper.
[01:14:33.644 --> 01:14:37.587]  Several witnesses that day claimed that there was a second shooter in the water tower.
[01:14:37.887 --> 01:14:42.530]  I just screamed, it's the sniper, it's the sniper, and he was firing down toward the water tower.
[01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:43.410]  That's what we're hearing.
[01:14:43.931 --> 01:14:49.114]  Fox News live streamed the following testimony, but omitted it from final edits.
[01:14:49.934 --> 01:14:53.734]   fence where the other shooter was. There was one I heard in Watertower, there was one by
[01:14:53.734 --> 01:14:55.894]  the fence. And still obviously initial reports.
[01:14:55.894 --> 01:15:00.814]   NBC live streamed the following testimony of a woman who was in the front row.
[01:15:00.814 --> 01:15:06.132]   He could see the sharpshooter behind Trump. He said the sharpshooter shot to the left.
[01:15:06.132 --> 01:15:08.694]  He killed the gentleman in the Watertower here.
[01:15:08.694 --> 01:15:11.293]  And omitted the following from the final edit.
[01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:14.011]  Now they feel that there was two shooters on both sides.
[01:15:14.351 --> 01:15:18.913]  So they got the one on the tower on this side, but the one on the right side they never got.
[01:15:19.613 --> 01:15:23.875]  So that's why they wanted us to leave immediately because they thought there's still a shooter out there somewhere.
[01:15:24.435 --> 01:15:27.396]  I'm glad that guy's no longer with us anymore in that tower.
[01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.097]  And I hope they get the other one too.
[01:15:29.477 --> 01:15:32.278]  Images of the water tower show a shadow at the very top.
[01:15:32.678 --> 01:15:38.640]  Frame-by-frame analysis shows what could be described as muzzle flash or the reflection of a scope lens.
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:43.201]  Before any shots were fired, police were seen running towards the water tower.
[01:15:43.401 --> 01:15:45.442]  Oh wow, where are they running to?
[01:15:47.719 --> 01:15:52.080]  Multiple shooters makes more sense, but then how did they miss?
[01:15:52.761 --> 01:15:57.142]  Many are insisting that it was a staged event to inflame Trump's popularity.
[01:15:57.462 --> 01:16:07.345]  We still don't know for sure whether Donald Trump was hit by a bullet, whether he was hit by glass fragments, whether he was hit by shrapnel.
[01:16:07.866 --> 01:16:08.966]  We don't have those details.
[01:16:09.306 --> 01:16:18.193]  We actually have no details from his physician, even though this man is still a Secret Service protected presidential candidate.
[01:16:20.115 --> 01:16:21.035]  We know almost nothing.
[01:16:22.236 --> 01:16:22.637]  Why?
[01:16:23.117 --> 01:16:24.778]  Why don't we know that much?
[01:16:25.119 --> 01:16:32.985]  We don't know why, for nine full seconds, Donald Trump was allowed to stand back up.
[01:16:34.261 --> 01:16:47.306]  During an active shooting, an active shooter situation, even though they at that point had said the shooter was down, how would they have known if there were more shooters or not?
[01:16:47.926 --> 01:17:00.391]  Nobody knew that there could have been five shooters for all they knew, yet they allowed him to stand up in the middle of that crisis and pose for a photo.
[01:17:02.163 --> 01:17:06.523]  fist pump the air so he could get the iconic photo.
[01:17:06.523 --> 01:17:10.403]   And then they allowed him to stand up again outside of the SUV instead of
[01:17:10.403 --> 01:17:12.243]  just shoving him in the SUV.
[01:17:12.243 --> 01:17:14.203]  That seems really unusual.
[01:17:14.203 --> 01:17:18.643]   What is the actual injury to Donald Trump's ear that's under that bandage?
[01:17:18.643 --> 01:17:19.923]  Shouldn't we know that by now?
[01:17:20.484 --> 01:17:23.144]  If it was fake, it was a flawless performance.
[01:17:23.585 --> 01:17:28.306]  And if it was authentic, it was not only sloppy, it was a millimeter away from chaos.
[01:17:28.926 --> 01:17:41.010]  Either way, Trump is now seen by many religious people as being ordained by God, and by others as being the Antichrist, who believers have been expecting to survive an assassination attempt.
[01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:44.310]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:50.310]  [Music]
[01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:56.310]   The Bible says the Antichrist receives a mortal wound, meaning it would kill him in the head.
[01:17:57.184 --> 01:17:57.604]  In the head.
[01:17:58.365 --> 01:17:59.125]  Not on the ear.
[01:17:59.826 --> 01:18:00.847]  Trump's not the Antichrist.
[01:18:01.607 --> 01:18:02.568]  But look, here's the deal.
[01:18:02.728 --> 01:18:08.672]  Idiots like Joy Reid and Joy Behar and... I mean, they're all doing it.
[01:18:08.693 --> 01:18:09.333]  There's hundreds of them.
[01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:10.474]  I can't even keep track of it anymore.
[01:18:10.494 --> 01:18:13.956]  Are saying this was staged.
[01:18:14.757 --> 01:18:15.638]  Are saying this was fake.
[01:18:16.661 --> 01:18:19.022]  One of the heads of the beast seemed to have a fatal wound.
[01:18:19.423 --> 01:18:20.783]  The fatal wound had been healed.
[01:18:20.823 --> 01:18:22.724]  The whole world was filled with wonder.
[01:18:23.585 --> 01:18:24.365]  And follow the beast.
[01:18:25.846 --> 01:18:27.167]  So that's the NIV version.
[01:18:28.888 --> 01:18:30.969]  But there when Teddy Roosevelt got shot and lived.
[01:18:31.069 --> 01:18:31.949]  Was he the Antichrist?
[01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:37.992]  So, Hollywood leftist George Takai claims Keith Olbermann, all of them.
[01:18:38.593 --> 01:18:40.594]  Trump was not actually hit by a bullet.
[01:18:40.634 --> 01:18:42.375]  Needs a doctor's report to prove it.
[01:18:43.086 --> 01:18:44.107]  Okay, they have the right to say that.
[01:18:44.127 --> 01:18:46.789]  People say sue them, fire them.
[01:18:46.989 --> 01:18:47.709]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:18:50.551 --> 01:18:50.731]  No.
[01:18:51.292 --> 01:18:52.693]  He has a right to say that.
[01:18:52.753 --> 01:18:54.154]  He has a right to say the moon's made of cheese.
[01:18:54.874 --> 01:18:58.637]  Craves Donald Trump shooting conspiracies have revived a very American tradition.
[01:18:59.137 --> 01:19:00.658]  Well, yeah, it is a tradition to question things.
[01:19:00.678 --> 01:19:01.058]  You should.
[01:19:02.639 --> 01:19:06.702]  MSNBC star Joy Reid pumps more conspiracy theories about Trump assassination attempt.
[01:19:07.083 --> 01:19:08.103]  Seems really unusual.
[01:19:08.123 --> 01:19:08.964]  You just saw her say that.
[01:19:11.243 --> 01:19:13.306]  Matt Owl talks about it looking staged.
[01:19:14.067 --> 01:19:18.533]  Let me just tell you something right now, and I think most viewers agree with this if anybody's been around guns or done any hunting.
[01:19:20.476 --> 01:19:26.123]  You don't sit there with a bunch of shooters and shoot at somebody with real bullets that are killing people in the stands and wounding them.
[01:19:27.136 --> 01:19:28.637]  And it's a staged event.
[01:19:28.857 --> 01:19:30.318]  Like Trump got together with the Secret Service.
[01:19:30.398 --> 01:19:36.742]  Okay, you shoot at me and you graze my ear perfectly, a millimeter off, hit my skull, and then I pop back up.
[01:19:36.842 --> 01:19:37.762]  No, they're all over him.
[01:19:37.802 --> 01:19:39.964]  He says, wait, wait, because he's a TV guy.
[01:19:40.004 --> 01:19:43.666]  And he says, fight, fight, because he talked about it at Thursday's speech.
[01:19:44.787 --> 01:19:47.008]  He said he's down there looking at everybody freaking out, quiet.
[01:19:48.269 --> 01:19:49.349]  He knows they think he's dead.
[01:19:49.650 --> 01:19:50.690]  They bring him back up.
[01:19:50.730 --> 01:19:51.271]  They say, ready?
[01:19:51.291 --> 01:19:51.691]  He goes, yeah.
[01:19:51.711 --> 01:19:52.331]  He goes, stop.
[01:19:53.172 --> 01:19:53.692]  They stop.
[01:19:55.313 --> 01:19:56.554]  He says, fight, fight, fight.
[01:19:57.796 --> 01:19:59.697]  You don't stage stuff like that.
[01:19:59.737 --> 01:20:01.157]  You don't stage the dead firefighter.
[01:20:01.177 --> 01:20:01.758]  You don't stage that.
[01:20:01.778 --> 01:20:03.979]  There's video on the event happening.
[01:20:04.959 --> 01:20:06.080]  And we know they stood down.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:09.501]  We know they let the supposed patsy shooter wander around the bottom of the building.
[01:20:11.342 --> 01:20:17.785]  They had open windows on the two-story warehouse that had this barely slanted roof they tell us we couldn't put Secret Service on.
[01:20:17.805 --> 01:20:25.388]  I'll put a meme out that shows the bullet actually hit him in the side of the ear and it says lower grocery prices.
[01:20:27.483 --> 01:20:31.125]  But a slightly different angle, it hit him in the back of the brain, civil war.
[01:20:32.325 --> 01:20:34.246]  What would have happened if they killed Trump?
[01:20:34.306 --> 01:20:41.589]  And I've been saying they're going to try to kill Trump, and if they do kill Trump, they're going to send a bunch of truck bombs and other attacks and blame Trump supporters to get a civil war going.
[01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:46.951]  As Trump said a thousand times, they're not after him, they gotta get through him to get to us.
[01:20:47.051 --> 01:20:50.613]  That's why I'm so urgent, that's why I'm so concerned, that's why I'm so focused.
[01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:54.855]  That's why we're up here on Saturday.
[01:20:55.990 --> 01:21:02.093]  Talking about this is why we're going to cut up this live two plus hour show and post it on X and it may not video.
[01:21:02.113 --> 01:21:02.673]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:21:04.434 --> 01:21:07.295]  Couple degrees different civil war affordable groceries the other way.
[01:21:08.636 --> 01:21:10.417]  That's how close this went folks.
[01:21:11.997 --> 01:21:15.179]  And you got Victoria Nuland saying Trump's about to get a nasty surprise.
[01:21:15.219 --> 01:21:16.219]  He won't be the president.
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:17.400]  A month ago.
[01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:19.421]  I played the clips three times this week.
[01:21:21.465 --> 01:21:26.089]  You don't have deep state events where they got people shooting at somebody and it skims their ear.
[01:21:26.829 --> 01:21:42.101]  Again, no AI robot could do that in the world because of wind and direction and distance, unless there was a chip in Trump's brain that made him move at the exact millisecond as the trigger was pulled.
[01:21:42.121 --> 01:21:55.931]   And you've got the leftist Antifa scumbag, now admitted Antifa, up there for hours wandering around, gets a gun in, Open windows of the same building and all of the trash missed.
[01:21:58.172 --> 01:22:02.095]  Because Trump was wiggling around and moving around and pointing at things.
[01:22:02.155 --> 01:22:05.116]  If he'd have been like most speakers like this, when I speak, I'm kind of like this.
[01:22:05.176 --> 01:22:06.798]  I wave my arms around, but I stay in the same place.
[01:22:07.498 --> 01:22:08.058]  Trump's like this.
[01:22:08.759 --> 01:22:09.359]  I move around.
[01:22:13.242 --> 01:22:14.042]  Look at this chart.
[01:22:14.122 --> 01:22:14.723]  It's amazing.
[01:22:14.783 --> 01:22:15.323]  Look at it.
[01:22:15.663 --> 01:22:16.284]  Look at it.
[01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:17.124]  You see the chart?
[01:22:17.384 --> 01:22:18.925]  This is my favorite chart.
[01:22:20.426 --> 01:22:21.287]  Here's the chart right here.
[01:22:22.890 --> 01:22:27.291]  Of illegal alien invasion that Obama started that Trump then slammed down to nothing.
[01:22:28.151 --> 01:22:29.192]  It's a beautiful chart.
[01:22:30.912 --> 01:22:31.572]  There's Obama.
[01:22:31.852 --> 01:22:32.893]  Trump gets in.
[01:22:33.653 --> 01:22:34.353]  Biden gets in.
[01:22:34.373 --> 01:22:36.934]  It's a beautiful chart.
[01:22:38.234 --> 01:22:39.795]  God save you though, not the chart.
[01:22:39.835 --> 01:22:41.215]  And Trump said God save me three times.
[01:22:41.235 --> 01:22:42.715]  He said the chart saved me once.
[01:22:43.396 --> 01:22:52.158]  But the point is, this is the reality of what we're facing.
[01:22:53.689 --> 01:23:00.134]  And so the deep state is now going to pull out all of the stops and do anything they can do.
[01:23:00.694 --> 01:23:05.438]  And it's truck moms, false flags, cyber attacks, blow up Trump's airplane.
[01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:13.324]  I imagine the QAnon folks, you're going to say that they blow Trump's plane up next week.
[01:23:14.525 --> 01:23:16.286]  Oh, he's with JFK Jr.
[01:23:16.326 --> 01:23:16.666]  now.
[01:23:17.067 --> 01:23:18.127]  They're really the president.
[01:23:18.147 --> 01:23:19.969]  They'll say Kamala's really JFK Jr.
[01:23:20.249 --> 01:23:21.390]  This is cuckoo brain.
[01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:24.451]  This is diseased worm brain.
[01:23:25.732 --> 01:23:27.393]  Same worm that got in R.L.K.
[01:23:27.413 --> 01:23:28.774]   Jr.' 's brain has gotten in yours.
[01:23:29.334 --> 01:23:29.494]  No.
[01:23:29.794 --> 01:23:30.635]  This is real.
[01:23:30.955 --> 01:23:31.775]  Trump's for real.
[01:23:31.975 --> 01:23:33.016]  He cares about America.
[01:23:33.256 --> 01:23:34.117]  He cares about freedom.
[01:23:34.357 --> 01:23:37.279]  And I want to play Hulk Hogan, who called in the show many years ago.
[01:23:38.119 --> 01:23:38.739]  I know he's a listener.
[01:23:38.759 --> 01:23:39.580]  I want to get him on the show.
[01:23:41.661 --> 01:23:42.422]  Here's Hulk Hogan.
[01:23:42.462 --> 01:23:43.042]  Not the short clip.
[01:23:43.062 --> 01:23:44.483]  I want the longer clip of him on Hannity.
[01:23:46.184 --> 01:23:47.044]  And I know he's listening.
[01:23:47.084 --> 01:23:47.665]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:23:48.715 --> 01:23:51.275]  But that's what I said to George Strait when I singled him out the last few months.
[01:23:51.295 --> 01:23:52.216]  George Strait's a great guy.
[01:23:52.296 --> 01:23:54.716]  I know his crew, friends of some of his band.
[01:23:55.136 --> 01:23:55.956]  He's a listener.
[01:23:56.757 --> 01:23:58.877]  But he's like, I'm an entertainer, I'm not getting into politics.
[01:23:58.897 --> 01:24:00.237]  Well, politics has gotten into you.
[01:24:01.317 --> 01:24:04.098]  The New World Order is making its move on civilization and society.
[01:24:04.678 --> 01:24:06.478]  We'll be radioactive if we don't.
[01:24:06.538 --> 01:24:07.639]  And I'm not singling out George Strait.
[01:24:07.659 --> 01:24:08.499]  I'm just using him as an example.
[01:24:08.779 --> 01:24:10.719]  And that's what Hulk Hogan said.
[01:24:10.759 --> 01:24:12.699]  He said, listen, I've been cowardly.
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:14.220]  I've got to go public.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.200]  These are my views.
[01:24:18.465 --> 01:24:22.007]  And we'll lose everything if we don't get engaged now.
[01:24:24.107 --> 01:24:24.528]  Here it is.
[01:24:27.409 --> 01:24:39.434]  All right, last night, legendary pro wrestler Hulk Hogan captivated America with a very entertaining speech at the RNC, including this scene of him ripping his shirt off.
[01:24:39.614 --> 01:24:40.054]  Take a look.
[01:24:41.155 --> 01:24:46.597]  But what happened last week when they took a shot at my hero?
[01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:54.864]  And they tried to kill the next President of the United States!
[01:24:56.245 --> 01:24:58.307]  Enough was enough!
[01:24:58.947 --> 01:25:03.371]  And I said, let Trumpamania run wild, brother!
[01:25:03.391 --> 01:25:07.654]  Let Trumpamania rule again!
[01:25:07.494 --> 01:25:14.494]  make America great again!
[01:25:14.494 --> 01:25:21.494]  USA! USA! USA!
[01:25:21.494 --> 01:25:26.934]   Max idea with more wrestling legend hal cohen uh...
[01:25:27.533 --> 01:25:28.554]  I was in the building.
[01:25:28.774 --> 01:25:31.435]  It was electric, an amazing speech.
[01:25:32.316 --> 01:25:37.138]  I don't know how much of that were prepared remarks versus you just being you.
[01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:38.259]  What was it?
[01:25:39.781 --> 01:25:47.003]  Well, brother, you know, it was electric there last night and my partner that was with me, he said the stage manager commented to him.
[01:25:47.023 --> 01:25:50.584]  He hasn't gone to the teleprompter for six minutes.
[01:25:50.924 --> 01:25:53.285]  I'm surprised they haven't jerked him off the stage yet.
[01:25:53.705 --> 01:25:59.787]  So, brother, I was, I was winging and flying and pivoting and just doing audibles, man.
[01:25:59.827 --> 01:26:01.407]  I was listening to the crowd and feeling them.
[01:26:01.787 --> 01:26:03.748]  It kind of was like being in the wrestling ring.
[01:26:05.083 --> 01:26:05.283]  Yeah.
[01:26:05.684 --> 01:26:07.886]  You know, you said something that really caught my attention.
[01:26:07.926 --> 01:26:11.789]  You said, as an entertainer, you try to stay out of politics.
[01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:23.159]  You went on to say, but after everything that's happened to our country over the past four years, everything that happened last weekend, I can no longer stay silent.
[01:26:23.699 --> 01:26:24.020]  Explain.
[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:31.146]  Well brother, as an entertainer, you want to sell tickets, and you really don't want to split your audience.
[01:26:31.186 --> 01:26:34.229]  You don't want to say, I'm a Democrat or I'm a Republican.
[01:26:34.249 --> 01:26:36.911]  You want all kinds of people to come to see you perform.
[01:26:37.692 --> 01:26:39.494]  I stayed silent for so long.
[01:26:39.974 --> 01:26:41.176]  It was killing me.
[01:26:41.576 --> 01:26:44.319]  I watched the border crash and burn.
[01:26:44.379 --> 01:26:46.160]  I watched the economy crash and burn.
[01:26:47.982 --> 01:26:50.083]  Trump's family be compromised.
[01:26:50.623 --> 01:26:51.524]  I watched his business.
[01:26:51.584 --> 01:26:53.024]  I watched him try to put him in jail.
[01:26:53.565 --> 01:26:56.366]  I was silent and I hardly could hold my tongue.
[01:26:56.786 --> 01:27:02.829]  And then when they took that shot at him and tried to kill our leader, that was it for me, brother.
[01:27:03.029 --> 01:27:04.089]  I couldn't do it anymore.
[01:27:04.109 --> 01:27:07.711]  But that's why I stayed silent because it was a business decision.
[01:27:08.151 --> 01:27:09.272]  It was a weak decision.
[01:27:09.292 --> 01:27:11.173]  It was a cowardly decision.
[01:27:11.473 --> 01:27:13.414]  But now that's over with, brother.
[01:27:13.474 --> 01:27:14.094]  I'm on the team.
[01:27:15.464 --> 01:27:16.465]  You know, it's amazing.
[01:27:16.765 --> 01:27:22.369]  You talk about things and, you know, I'm sure over the years you've done really well financially.
[01:27:22.389 --> 01:27:25.652]  I started out with no money in my adult life.
[01:27:25.872 --> 01:27:28.394]  I would assume you probably did as well.
[01:27:29.134 --> 01:27:30.896]  And I remember those days.
[01:27:30.976 --> 01:27:32.777]  It's kind of burned into my brain.
[01:27:32.817 --> 01:27:35.959]  I still have the same thought process in some ways.
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:40.980]  And you think of 25% of Americans foregoing meals.
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:47.340]   You think of two-thirds of the country saying they're gasping for air trying to make ends
[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:48.340]  meet.
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:51.820]  You look at 11 million unvetted illegals at our border.
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:57.220]   You look at the insanity of no bail, defund, dismantle, re-imagine the police.
[01:27:57.435 --> 01:27:59.336]  You look at America's standing in the world.
[01:27:59.376 --> 01:28:01.717]  You look at the high price of energy for everybody.
[01:28:02.298 --> 01:28:11.763]  I mean, it just downright pisses me off because everything that I mentioned, including the assassination attempt, all of this was preventable.
[01:28:12.643 --> 01:28:15.625]  And when preventable things happen, it drives me up a wall.
[01:28:19.147 --> 01:28:20.668]  Well, I feel the same way.
[01:28:21.109 --> 01:28:31.637]  I mean, with the money, when we do not put America first, like it's been happening for years and years and years, if we have that type of money, every American should be a millionaire.
[01:28:31.977 --> 01:28:38.782]  With the billions and billions of dollars they've given away, it just kills me to see our vets on the street, to see the vets not being taken care of.
[01:28:39.223 --> 01:28:44.947]   I've been with the WWE Brothers since 1977, and one of the things we do is we Visit the hospitals.
[01:28:45.007 --> 01:28:46.269]  We do the USO tours.
[01:28:46.569 --> 01:28:47.730]  We go all over the place.
[01:28:48.090 --> 01:28:51.934]  These vets put their lives on the line for us so we can be free.
[01:28:52.155 --> 01:28:53.436]  And we don't take care of them?
[01:28:53.456 --> 01:28:59.262]  Donald Trump is putting his life on the line to try to make America great again?
[01:28:59.282 --> 01:29:01.364]  And someone like me is going to remain silent?
[01:29:02.435 --> 01:29:03.516]  It doesn't happen, brother.
[01:29:03.616 --> 01:29:04.877]  It can't go this way anymore.
[01:29:04.917 --> 01:29:15.826]  I want all the people that were in the same position I was, the ones that were afraid to put a Trump sign in their yard, the ones who were afraid to wear a Trump shirt or a Trump hat, to not be silent anymore.
[01:29:16.066 --> 01:29:22.011]  We need to save this country, not for ourselves, but for our children and our children's children for generations to come.
[01:29:22.312 --> 01:29:23.813]  This country needs to be saved.
[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:28.022]  After all, you know, he doesn't need to do this either.
[01:29:28.382 --> 01:29:30.623]  And I've asked him many times, why do you do it?
[01:29:31.003 --> 01:29:32.384]  Because we've got to save our country.
[01:29:32.924 --> 01:29:35.365]  I mean, to him, it's not even a thought process.
[01:29:35.726 --> 01:29:38.407]  It's instinctive, almost, at this point.
[01:29:39.067 --> 01:29:42.149]  And, you know, when he says he'll get it done very quickly, I believe he will.
[01:29:44.181 --> 01:29:46.262]  Well, the thing that kills me is I know this man.
[01:29:46.682 --> 01:29:52.245]  I mean, this man has been good to me, been good to my family, and I watch how he treats people over the years.
[01:29:52.525 --> 01:29:57.888]  I've known him for 35 years, and what the press does, they make him like he's the devil or something.
[01:29:58.169 --> 01:30:00.650]  They write the worst stuff in the world, and it's not true.
[01:30:01.170 --> 01:30:02.491]  This is a great man.
[01:30:02.871 --> 01:30:03.972]  This is a great American.
[01:30:04.292 --> 01:30:05.873]  Okay, he's got a personality.
[01:30:06.253 --> 01:30:06.953]  A lot of us do.
[01:30:07.294 --> 01:30:10.295]  Okay, he's got a little bit of an ego or a lot of an ego.
[01:30:10.656 --> 01:30:11.176]  Who cares?
[01:30:11.536 --> 01:30:12.857]  But he loves America.
[01:30:13.197 --> 01:30:13.977]  He loves people.
[01:30:14.278 --> 01:30:16.299]  He loves to see people do good.
[01:30:16.319 --> 01:30:18.020]  And that's what he's all about.
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:21.602]  And the sooner people get this, the sooner better off they will be.
[01:30:23.692 --> 01:30:31.575]  You know, they try to create a caricature and dehumanize him and they're willing to do anything to stop him.
[01:30:32.155 --> 01:30:35.557]  By the way, one thing that would stop me from ever getting in the ring is you.
[01:30:35.577 --> 01:30:39.098]  I think I'll pass on that opportunity if I'm ever given it.
[01:30:39.138 --> 01:30:41.199]  I've watched you in the ring, man, for a long time.
[01:30:41.879 --> 01:30:43.600]  And you're a killer out there.
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:45.881]  We appreciate you.
[01:30:46.041 --> 01:30:47.321]  Well, let me tell you something, my brother.
[01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:51.463]  I got remarried and I've got a stepson that I just got into jujitsu because of you.
[01:30:54.462 --> 01:30:55.685]  We're live 2 p.m.
[01:30:55.745 --> 01:31:06.644]   Central Sunday July 20th 2024 I'm your host Alex Jones and here's the bottom line I know most of our listeners already get all this, but I'm talking to the new crowd that's tuned in.
[01:31:07.164 --> 01:31:08.144]  This isn't a game.
[01:31:08.164 --> 01:31:09.405]  This isn't a movie.
[01:31:09.465 --> 01:31:10.425]  It's not entertainment.
[01:31:10.465 --> 01:31:11.946]  It's not Caddyshack.
[01:31:12.006 --> 01:31:13.046]  It's not Star Wars.
[01:31:13.346 --> 01:31:14.226]  It's not HBO.
[01:31:14.286 --> 01:31:15.106]  It's not Netflix.
[01:31:15.146 --> 01:31:16.387]  This is the real world.
[01:31:16.927 --> 01:31:19.848]  This is the globalists making their move right now.
[01:31:20.468 --> 01:31:23.309]  And the Deep State can try to give up, which I don't think they're going to do.
[01:31:23.329 --> 01:31:24.149]  They're going to try to kill Trump again.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:32.906]  So everybody's euphoric and celebrating, and Trump's gonna win, and the Democrats admit they're done, and they're fighting over if Biden's gonna leave or not, they are gonna make their move.
[01:31:34.327 --> 01:31:38.330]  And so we've got to be ahead of that move, and understand what they're doing, or we lose.
[01:31:38.690 --> 01:31:40.051]  We've been given a godsend.
[01:31:40.071 --> 01:31:45.075]  We have been given victory, but we've got to realize how precious it is, and thank God.
[01:31:45.095 --> 01:31:50.439]  So here's Darren McBreen, been here 14 years, great research reporter, he rarely does reports.
[01:31:50.799 --> 01:31:53.241]  He did a report on They Gotta Kill Trump, here it is.
[01:31:54.929 --> 01:31:56.510]  Trump, you better watch your back.
[01:31:57.291 --> 01:32:03.395]  Because if history really does repeat itself, that means your life is in serious danger.
[01:32:03.455 --> 01:32:04.396]  Like, right now.
[01:32:05.136 --> 01:32:06.897]  Learn from the past.
[01:32:07.258 --> 01:32:12.261]  Did you know that the first time they tried to kill JFK, it was not in Dallas?
[01:32:12.902 --> 01:32:15.243]  It was actually planned for Chicago.
[01:32:16.144 --> 01:32:20.087]  Kennedy was due to arrive there in Chicago on November 2nd, 1963.
[01:32:22.688 --> 01:32:29.213]  The newspapers conveniently printed JFK's motorcade route just like they did in Dallas.
[01:32:29.733 --> 01:32:44.163]  A hit team was assembled that included a pair of Cuban nationals and this guy, Arthur Thomas Valley, who perfectly fit the lone nut profile that would later be used to characterize Lee Harvey Oswald.
[01:32:44.787 --> 01:32:56.894]  Both of these guys, former Marines with links to anti-Castro Cubans, they both have three names, Thomas Arthur Valley, Lee Harvey Oswald, hell, they even look alike.
[01:32:57.335 --> 01:32:59.276]  The similarities are striking.
[01:32:59.736 --> 01:33:11.163]  Thomas Arthur Valley was also a sharpshooter who worked in an office building overlooking the motorcade route in Chicago, just like Lee Harvey Oswald in Daily Plaza.
[01:33:11.798 --> 01:33:15.181]  Now, the plot began to unravel when a woman called the U.S.
[01:33:15.221 --> 01:33:20.506]  Secret Service office a day before JFK's scheduled visit to Chicago.
[01:33:20.946 --> 01:33:27.032]  She was a hotel manager, and she grew suspicious of two Cuban nationals that were staying there.
[01:33:27.632 --> 01:33:43.539]  She waited until they were not in the room, and then she went, unlocked the door, went inside, took a look around, and she was alarmed to find four high-powered rifles along with a newspaper outlining the route of JFK's motorcade in Chicago.
[01:33:43.559 --> 01:33:44.139]  Wow!
[01:33:45.405 --> 01:34:00.196]  So the Secret Service immediately put these guys under surveillance, but they got a little too close because one of the suspects heard the radio dispatch from the surveillance vehicle, they panicked, and then they packed up their gear and fled the scene.
[01:34:00.636 --> 01:34:05.260]  By this time, the Secret Service was also looking for Arthur Thomas Valley.
[01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:11.744]  They called the Chicago Police Department and they told him, get Valley off the streets.
[01:34:12.285 --> 01:34:19.412]   Two hours before JFK's planned motorcade, The Chicago Police indeed located Arthur Thomas Valley.
[01:34:19.432 --> 01:34:20.253]  They pulled him over.
[01:34:20.894 --> 01:34:27.021]  They looked in the trunk of his car and found an M1 rifle and 3,000 rounds of ammunition.
[01:34:27.101 --> 01:34:33.008]  They figured he was probably on his way to the office building where he worked, overlooking the motorcade route.
[01:34:33.388 --> 01:34:42.718]  And that's when JFK abruptly cancelled his trip to Chicago, as crowds of people were already lining the streets to watch the motorcade.
[01:34:43.139 --> 01:34:44.340]  So it was a close call.
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:53.330]  And there's also compelling evidence that there was another assassination team ready to strike later that same month in Tampa, Florida.
[01:34:53.945 --> 01:34:58.586]  But it was called off last minute by mob boss Santo Traficante.
[01:34:58.987 --> 01:35:03.848]  It was almost like it was a competition to see who would kill JFK first.
[01:35:04.228 --> 01:35:06.149]  Three attempts in one month.
[01:35:06.629 --> 01:35:12.331]  And as we all know, they eventually got him on November 22nd in Dallas, Texas.
[01:35:12.811 --> 01:35:17.652]  So please, President Trump, for the love of God, please be careful.
[01:35:17.992 --> 01:35:20.193]  America needs you now more than ever.
[01:35:20.939 --> 01:35:25.963]  I'm also asking our audience to please pray for Donald Trump and his safety.
[01:35:26.364 --> 01:35:37.453]  Because if we've learned anything from history and the dark forces who carry out these assassinations, if at first they don't succeed, they will try, try again.
[01:35:38.253 --> 01:35:38.994]  Watch your back.
[01:35:39.574 --> 01:35:45.679]  Alright, that report is up on the InfoWars site.
[01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:49.723]  It's up on InfoWars Twitter, but it needs to be posted to RealAlexJones.
[01:35:51.118 --> 01:35:58.225]  But it's so critical, exactly, when they first don't succeed, try, try, try, try, try again.
[01:35:59.786 --> 01:36:04.431]  And you go back to the Misfits song back in the 70s, Kennedy shattered head.
[01:36:05.472 --> 01:36:07.794]  Texas is the reason, but the president's dead.
[01:36:10.111 --> 01:36:10.811]  And that's where we are.
[01:36:11.451 --> 01:36:13.492]  The globalists are more desperate than ever.
[01:36:13.952 --> 01:36:17.393]  The fact that they failed makes Trump ten times more powerful globally.
[01:36:17.693 --> 01:36:18.813]  He already talked to Zelensky.
[01:36:18.853 --> 01:36:19.713]  I've got that coming up.
[01:36:20.073 --> 01:36:20.773]  Wanting a peace deal.
[01:36:20.793 --> 01:36:21.533]  Zelensky agrees.
[01:36:21.613 --> 01:36:24.734]  Zelensky knows he's a puppet being ordered by NATO to keep this impossible war going.
[01:36:24.974 --> 01:36:26.294]  He told Trump he wants peace right now.
[01:36:27.015 --> 01:36:30.535]  So we can do all of this right now just like Kennedy was calling back the troops from Vietnam.
[01:36:30.895 --> 01:36:31.716]  A month later they kill him.
[01:36:33.396 --> 01:36:36.016]  This is such an epic moment to be alive.
[01:36:36.076 --> 01:36:38.357]  The fight for the heart and soul of America.
[01:36:39.457 --> 01:36:40.357]  And where we are.
[01:36:41.738 --> 01:36:42.658]  And where we're going.
[01:36:43.838 --> 01:36:46.679]  No wonder they tried six weeks ago to shut us down without a court order.
[01:36:47.299 --> 01:36:49.700]  Because I knew then, I said, this isn't about me, this is about killing Trump.
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:52.541]  And I said it then, with Laura Logan sitting right there.
[01:36:53.041 --> 01:36:55.702]  Dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of times.
[01:36:55.742 --> 01:37:04.925]  Now, Tucker Carlson had an incredible speech, and I gave him a close second, out of Hulk Hogan and Donald Trump and everybody else, to Eric Trump.
[01:37:06.084 --> 01:37:12.205]  So I'm going to air first the Eric Trump, then the Tucker Carlson, and then Lou Dobbs died a few days ago.
[01:37:12.245 --> 01:37:14.326]  We covered it then, got almost no coverage.
[01:37:15.366 --> 01:37:19.687]  Everybody's talking about Sheila Jackson Lee that thinks the moon is made of gas and is as big as the sun.
[01:37:19.707 --> 01:37:22.807]  Feel sorry for her, but a total moron.
[01:37:23.547 --> 01:37:24.507]  Puppet of the deep state.
[01:37:25.428 --> 01:37:26.968]  So we're talking about Sheila Jackson Lee dying.
[01:37:26.988 --> 01:37:29.688]  Remember Lou Dobbs who had 10, 15 million viewers a night?
[01:37:29.928 --> 01:37:32.749]  He was the head of CNN back when it was popular.
[01:37:34.482 --> 01:37:35.762]  He was just on my show a few months ago.
[01:37:36.562 --> 01:37:37.183]  He's dead now.
[01:37:39.923 --> 01:37:53.346]  And we need to remember him because without people like Lou Dobbs, folks, and I mean, it was Lou Dobbs who, who literally, I mean, I was around as long as he was on air fighting the globalists, but I've been on air 30 years.
[01:37:53.386 --> 01:37:55.407]  About 30 years ago, he made a hard turn against the new world order.
[01:37:55.947 --> 01:37:57.687]  So as long as I've been fighting him, he's been fighting him.
[01:37:57.987 --> 01:37:59.588]  He was the head of CNN, not just the top host.
[01:38:01.127 --> 01:38:04.590]  Made him super popular, super profitable, patriotism, America, remember that?
[01:38:05.431 --> 01:38:05.991]  They got rid of him.
[01:38:07.372 --> 01:38:09.374]  Then on Fox News, he exposed the border invasion.
[01:38:09.834 --> 01:38:11.796]  So they fired him seven years ago.
[01:38:12.957 --> 01:38:14.538]  And now he's gone, but he will live on.
[01:38:14.558 --> 01:38:17.061]  And we owe Lou Dobbs so much.
[01:38:17.181 --> 01:38:18.382]  What a great person.
[01:38:18.922 --> 01:38:20.103]  What an amazing individual.
[01:38:20.163 --> 01:38:20.864]  That's coming up.
[01:38:21.926 --> 01:38:22.967]  I'm going to do a whole tribute to him.
[01:38:22.987 --> 01:38:24.207]  We're going to find all those old interviews.
[01:38:24.227 --> 01:38:24.848]  They're already on the internet.
[01:38:24.868 --> 01:38:25.708]  We got them somewhere around here.
[01:38:26.168 --> 01:38:31.652]  Exposing the open borders, replacement migration, the new world order, the carbon tax, all of it.
[01:38:31.752 --> 01:38:35.654]  I mean, Lou Dobbs was Alex Jones back when I was on AXS TV.
[01:38:37.215 --> 01:38:38.095]  We owe Lou Dobbs.
[01:38:38.135 --> 01:38:39.816]  He was tomorrow's news today.
[01:38:39.876 --> 01:38:40.757]  We're proud of you, Lou.
[01:38:40.777 --> 01:38:41.497]  We know you're in heaven.
[01:38:41.818 --> 01:38:42.938]  We appreciate you, Lou.
[01:38:42.958 --> 01:38:44.659]  But it makes me sick.
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:50.903]  I know that the assassination overshadowed it at the RNC, and Trump put out a message about Lou.
[01:38:53.487 --> 01:39:13.442]  In fact, I want to play a little bit of this song, Bullet, from Misfits, and then I want to play Trump responding to Lou Dobbs' death, and then I'm going to go ahead and go to Eric Trump, and then I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to go to Tucker Carlson, and then I'm going to go to Lou Dobbs' interview, the last interview with Lou Dobbs.
[01:39:14.003 --> 01:39:14.863]  I know he was on my show.
[01:39:14.883 --> 01:39:16.565]  They told me, I think I get the last interview.
[01:39:16.585 --> 01:39:17.125]  I didn't ask you guys.
[01:39:17.365 --> 01:39:19.327]  Did you get my interview with him or my interview with him?
[01:39:21.522 --> 01:39:22.903]  I'm on his show, the last one, okay.
[01:39:23.724 --> 01:39:29.168]  Alright, so we'll... I just feel like I've lost a grandfather or something here.
[01:39:29.208 --> 01:39:32.790]  That's the craziest part about being alive so long.
[01:39:33.391 --> 01:39:39.175]  Almost everybody I knew is dead, and I just... He did so much for us.
[01:39:39.195 --> 01:39:42.258]  I mean, it's just... We've got to really appreciate these people, folks.
[01:39:43.319 --> 01:39:49.763]  Because Trump won't always be there, and Lou Dobbs won't always be there, and Eric Carlson won't always be there, and I won't always be there.
[01:39:50.123 --> 01:39:51.243]  You've got to pick up the torch.
[01:39:51.283 --> 01:39:52.524]  You've got to continue on with the future.
[01:39:53.824 --> 01:39:57.465]   There's a little bit of bullet from the misfits with Glenn Danzig.
[01:39:57.465 --> 01:40:07.465]  [MUSIC]
[01:40:07.465 --> 01:40:17.465]  [MUSIC]
[01:40:17.465 --> 01:40:27.465]  [MUSIC]
[01:40:45.903 --> 01:40:48.304]  Well, Texas always gets the job done.
[01:40:48.036 --> 01:40:52.238]  The tradies always answer the call, for good and bad.
[01:40:53.518 --> 01:40:55.639]  But Texas is balancing it out with us, folks.
[01:40:56.079 --> 01:41:03.079]  fighting for Trump right now.
[01:41:03.079 --> 01:41:10.838]  Alright, sorry for the family audience playing that.
[01:41:10.884 --> 01:41:13.305]  I know it's a historical clip, so we got it out there.
[01:41:13.365 --> 01:41:14.105]  It's an adult show.
[01:41:14.885 --> 01:41:17.606]  All right, take the clips out, parents, though, and show your kids the clean parts.
[01:41:17.626 --> 01:41:19.546]  95% of it is, but we're historic.
[01:41:19.566 --> 01:41:20.147]  We're documenting.
[01:41:20.187 --> 01:41:20.787]  That's the way it is.
[01:41:22.667 --> 01:41:24.568]  All right, I mentioned Trump on Lou Dobbs.
[01:41:24.788 --> 01:41:26.248]  I mean, it was like a punch in the gut.
[01:41:27.268 --> 01:41:31.169]  Yesterday morning when I learned Lou Dobbs is dead, and I talked about it quite a bit on the show, and I just looked everywhere.
[01:41:31.749 --> 01:41:32.329]  No coverage.
[01:41:32.369 --> 01:41:34.670]  So we're going to, this week, and damn it, we're going to do it.
[01:41:35.570 --> 01:41:38.491]  Go and get some of his CNN shows, his Fox Business shows.
[01:41:40.049 --> 01:41:41.690]  I want 30 minutes this week on Lou Dobbs.
[01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:43.390]  I want three reports on Lou Dobbs.
[01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:46.131]  I want... It's just, man.
[01:41:46.572 --> 01:41:48.952]  I mean, he really laid the groundwork for what we're doing right now.
[01:41:49.573 --> 01:41:50.533]  We salute you, brother.
[01:41:50.553 --> 01:41:51.313]  We'll see you in heaven.
[01:41:51.333 --> 01:41:52.194]  We love you, Lou.
[01:41:52.834 --> 01:41:53.654]  Here's President Trump.
[01:41:53.674 --> 01:42:00.397]  Lou Dobbs was one of the greatest ever in an industry that had a lot of great people.
[01:42:00.437 --> 01:42:01.517]  There was nobody like him.
[01:42:02.018 --> 01:42:05.719]  He was my friend, and he was a real talent, and he was a tough cookie.
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:10.023]  He was so tough, but he was tough on bad people, not on good people.
[01:42:10.843 --> 01:42:12.644]  He is somebody that's really going to be missed.
[01:42:12.664 --> 01:42:13.485]  He's a big voice.
[01:42:13.585 --> 01:42:16.427]  Lou was a really big voice, a very powerful voice.
[01:42:17.227 --> 01:42:18.368]  It's very devastating.
[01:42:18.428 --> 01:42:22.111]  I thought that he was going to, frankly, be around forever.
[01:42:23.044 --> 01:42:25.466]  Debbie, his wife, is unbelievable.
[01:42:25.526 --> 01:42:29.750]  I'd see him together all the time and they really had a great relationship.
[01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:31.691]  I thought Lou was going to be here for a long time.
[01:42:31.731 --> 01:42:33.833]  Then I got a little bad news two or three days ago.
[01:42:33.893 --> 01:42:38.877]  They were saying he wasn't feeling so hot and that made me feel badly.
[01:42:39.237 --> 01:42:42.480]  And I guess I wasn't feeling so hot either a few days ago, come to think of it.
[01:42:43.141 --> 01:42:46.924]  But Lou was just a very, very special guy to me.
[01:42:47.064 --> 01:42:50.366]  He was somebody very instrumental in the success of MAGA.
[01:42:51.187 --> 01:42:55.351]  He understood manga better than anybody, and he will truly be missed.
[01:42:55.391 --> 01:42:59.214]  He was truly a great man, great at what he did, and a great person.
[01:43:00.175 --> 01:43:02.977]  So it's an honor to do this little tribute for him.
[01:43:03.098 --> 01:43:05.360]  I would do it anywhere they wanted me to.
[01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:08.903]  He was very, very special, and may he rest in peace.
[01:43:10.564 --> 01:43:12.206]  Mr. Class, Donald Trump.
[01:43:14.307 --> 01:43:18.841]   Meanwhile, Sheila Jackson Lee, who was a Puppet.
[01:43:19.241 --> 01:43:23.143]  I'm sorry she's dead, but a complete idiot is getting all the attention.
[01:43:23.163 --> 01:43:24.044]  It's just disgusting.
[01:43:24.104 --> 01:43:25.765]  Truly disgusting.
[01:43:26.605 --> 01:43:27.946]  Um, but whatever.
[01:43:28.086 --> 01:43:29.127]  I'm upset she's dead too.
[01:43:29.767 --> 01:43:30.087]  All right.
[01:43:30.507 --> 01:43:31.468]  So here's what we're going to do.
[01:43:31.488 --> 01:43:33.329]  We're going to, I'm going to sign off.
[01:43:33.609 --> 01:43:40.253]  It'll still be live and we're going to air Eric Trump, who I think had the best speech.
[01:43:40.473 --> 01:43:42.474]  The next best speech was Tucker.
[01:43:43.516 --> 01:43:48.378]  And then we're going to play my last interview, when I was on with him, with Lou Dobson.
[01:43:49.359 --> 01:43:52.861]  And this week, coming up, I'll air my last interview with him as well, when I interviewed him.
[01:43:53.581 --> 01:43:58.744]  But I was supposed to be on the show two weeks ago, and they said, well, Lou's sick.
[01:43:59.704 --> 01:44:01.025]  I don't know why he died.
[01:44:01.045 --> 01:44:01.865]  I haven't talked to his wife.
[01:44:03.546 --> 01:44:04.526]  But I noticed he looked great.
[01:44:04.546 --> 01:44:05.527]  He was getting really skinny.
[01:44:05.547 --> 01:44:07.268]  Well, when you're that old, something else is going on.
[01:44:07.288 --> 01:44:11.210]  I don't know if it was cancer or what it was, but just an amazing, amazing guy.
[01:44:12.605 --> 01:44:13.385]  But here's the deal.
[01:44:13.425 --> 01:44:15.086]  The globalists are going to try to kill Trump again.
[01:44:15.106 --> 01:44:16.006]  They have no other hope.
[01:44:16.346 --> 01:44:17.347]  Pray for President Trump.
[01:44:17.907 --> 01:44:20.748]  And fight like you've never fought before.
[01:44:21.608 --> 01:44:26.710]  Because the deep state is desperate, and they're about to make their next big move.
[01:44:27.631 --> 01:44:29.932]  And they just tested this whole cyber takeover.
[01:44:30.392 --> 01:44:34.713]  They say to load, the experts are saying, software on the computers, try to steal it.
[01:44:34.753 --> 01:44:37.294]  But it's hard to steal a landslide.
[01:44:37.314 --> 01:44:40.996]  That's why Trump said, swamp them, make it so big they can't do it.
[01:44:41.670 --> 01:44:55.601]  They're in total disarray and I have never felt more concerned because I was scheduled to take my wife and middle daughter and youngest daughter on a week-long trip in about two weeks for just a week, just to the beach.
[01:44:56.602 --> 01:44:57.803]  And my wife walked in this morning.
[01:44:57.843 --> 01:44:58.744]  She said, we can't leave.
[01:44:58.784 --> 01:44:59.524]  You got to stay on the air.
[01:44:59.564 --> 01:45:00.245]  This is too dangerous.
[01:45:01.126 --> 01:45:02.066]  And I said, you're right.
[01:45:02.287 --> 01:45:06.950]  So we're going to cancel that vacation because every day is special.
[01:45:07.351 --> 01:45:13.406]   And just like I was in the air last Saturday and landed and learned that Trump had been shot, You can just feel the urgency, folks.
[01:45:13.466 --> 01:45:18.330]  So we're gonna be here seven days a week, fighting as hard as we can, but we can't do it without you.
[01:45:18.750 --> 01:45:20.471]  Plus, what's the point of a show if you don't promote it?
[01:45:20.512 --> 01:45:21.112]  We have no power.
[01:45:21.672 --> 01:45:23.814]  Promote the clips, promote the articles, promote the live feeds.
[01:45:24.375 --> 01:45:31.040]  I'm gonna, right after we end this live show, I'm gonna go meet with the crew, look at this last two and a half hours, what's the most important, take some clips out.
[01:45:31.421 --> 01:45:33.663]  Yeah, we'll reach a few million people if you don't get involved.
[01:45:34.323 --> 01:45:35.064]  That's still important.
[01:45:35.697 --> 01:45:42.102]  You get involved, send us your text messages, your friends, your family, your emails, strangers, repost it, then it'll reach 10 million.
[01:45:42.602 --> 01:45:43.603]  Excellent.
[01:45:43.623 --> 01:45:47.786]  And every inch we get, hell, if we're reaching thousands, I'd be on the show and have a big effect.
[01:45:48.246 --> 01:45:49.347]  We're not reaching thousands.
[01:45:49.487 --> 01:45:51.228]  In 30 years, God has put us in this position.
[01:45:51.889 --> 01:45:53.970]  We're having ultra massive effects right now.
[01:45:55.271 --> 01:45:57.753]  So, this is a new Trump, a hardcore Trump.
[01:45:57.773 --> 01:45:58.573]  He knows what's going on.
[01:45:58.974 --> 01:45:59.654]  He knows the score.
[01:46:00.435 --> 01:46:03.637]  So I'm going to air the Eric Trump.
[01:46:04.557 --> 01:46:07.762]  Tucker Carlson, my last interview with Lou Dobbs, where he interviewed me.
[01:46:07.782 --> 01:46:12.148]  And then we're going to reloop this until 4 p.m.
[01:46:12.188 --> 01:46:14.972]  tomorrow when I go live again with the Sunday show.
[01:46:16.654 --> 01:46:17.335]  For four hours.
[01:46:18.397 --> 01:46:20.320]  So please understand that people went through hell.
[01:46:21.854 --> 01:46:22.915]  To have this organization here.
[01:46:22.935 --> 01:46:24.415]  The crew's gone through hell, and we're not bitching.
[01:46:24.876 --> 01:46:31.199]  But God has kept us in position, like holding us in gravity, only because of your prayers, your word of mouth, and your support.
[01:46:31.239 --> 01:46:33.260]  So, go to mfullwarstore.com.
[01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:35.081]  Go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:46:35.461 --> 01:46:36.481]  Check out the great products.
[01:46:36.621 --> 01:46:43.865]  Commit to support the tip of the spear in the fight against the new world order, and I commend those that have helped, and I ask those that haven't, what are you thinking?
[01:46:43.965 --> 01:46:44.806]  Like Hulk Hogan said.
[01:46:45.906 --> 01:46:50.088]  Show the short Hulk Hogan, not the full candy, but the shorter clip I sent you.
[01:46:50.108 --> 01:46:50.789]  51 seconds long.
[01:46:52.517 --> 01:46:56.000]  We're going to play that and go out to Eric Trump and more.
[01:46:57.401 --> 01:46:59.583]  And here he is saying, man, I was cowardly.
[01:47:01.084 --> 01:47:04.347]  All your managers tell you, don't balkanize people.
[01:47:05.048 --> 01:47:05.868]  Don't be political.
[01:47:05.929 --> 01:47:07.510]  When everything's political, you don't have a choice.
[01:47:07.530 --> 01:47:08.851]  Your money will be worthless.
[01:47:09.492 --> 01:47:10.232]  Hulk knows that.
[01:47:10.753 --> 01:47:12.574]  And I singled out George Strait saying, where is he?
[01:47:12.634 --> 01:47:13.575]  I know people that know him well.
[01:47:13.635 --> 01:47:14.376]  I'm friends with his band.
[01:47:15.529 --> 01:47:16.289]  And he knows all this.
[01:47:16.529 --> 01:47:17.910]  I don't say he should stand up.
[01:47:18.350 --> 01:47:19.310]  Everybody should stand up.
[01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:20.190]  You should choose a side.
[01:47:20.551 --> 01:47:21.791]  This is the time to do it.
[01:47:21.831 --> 01:47:23.672]  But Holt said that exact thing.
[01:47:24.572 --> 01:47:25.492]  There's no more games.
[01:47:26.072 --> 01:47:26.832]  Trump's all in.
[01:47:26.893 --> 01:47:28.493]  He's had his whole life compromised.
[01:47:28.913 --> 01:47:30.974]  Because Trump knows he'll lose it all if he doesn't.
[01:47:31.354 --> 01:47:33.655]  Trump knows there's no other move but this move.
[01:47:33.715 --> 01:47:35.375]  It's distinctive, as Sean Hannity said.
[01:47:36.876 --> 01:47:38.256]  This is a new Republican Party.
[01:47:38.276 --> 01:47:40.517]  They're not perfect, but compared to the Democrats, they're angels.
[01:47:41.117 --> 01:47:41.917]  And they're scared.
[01:47:42.757 --> 01:47:50.366]   So here's Hulk Hogan on Trump, and I ask you to back us just like you backed Trump because we got Trump elected, you got Trump elected.
[01:47:50.866 --> 01:47:51.727]  The enemy knows that.
[01:47:51.767 --> 01:47:52.448]  They hate our guts.
[01:47:52.468 --> 01:47:53.308]  We know their battle plans.
[01:47:53.328 --> 01:47:53.909]  We know how to beat them.
[01:47:54.249 --> 01:47:56.431]  They wanted us off air right now and they did this, but they failed.
[01:47:56.671 --> 01:47:57.652]  They failed to get us off air.
[01:47:58.132 --> 01:47:59.093]  They failed to kill Trump.
[01:47:59.934 --> 01:48:01.014]  They failed to get us off air.
[01:48:01.315 --> 01:48:02.295]  They failed to kill Trump.
[01:48:02.716 --> 01:48:06.399]  Now, if you take action and spread the word and say, we know you stood down.
[01:48:06.679 --> 01:48:07.660]  We know it's a deep state.
[01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:08.901]  We know you've got the open border.
[01:48:09.141 --> 01:48:10.302]  We know you've got the fentanyl.
[01:48:10.482 --> 01:48:11.543]  We know you're devaluing the dollar.
[01:48:11.783 --> 01:48:12.724]  We know you're starting World War III.
[01:48:12.744 --> 01:48:13.664]  You know, I mentioned all this.
[01:48:13.684 --> 01:48:14.325]  Let me hit this right now.
[01:48:16.383 --> 01:48:17.503]  Trump talked to Zelensky today.
[01:48:17.523 --> 01:48:18.183]  It's all over the news.
[01:48:18.723 --> 01:48:21.564]  Zelensky said, AP Reuters, he wants peace.
[01:48:22.624 --> 01:48:24.505]  He said if Trump comes in, he's ready to end the war.
[01:48:24.805 --> 01:48:26.105]  NATO controls Zelensky.
[01:48:26.125 --> 01:48:27.565]  They'll kill him the minute he doesn't do it.
[01:48:28.605 --> 01:48:32.426]  NATO started the war 11 years ago, expanded it 3 years ago.
[01:48:32.706 --> 01:48:33.486]  So Russia responded.
[01:48:33.506 --> 01:48:35.587]  They're not perfect, but they drew first blood.
[01:48:36.147 --> 01:48:36.767]  The CIA.
[01:48:37.327 --> 01:48:39.628]  Victoria Nuland said Trump's going to have a nasty surprise.
[01:48:39.888 --> 01:48:41.008]  He won't be the president a month ago.
[01:48:42.244 --> 01:48:45.486]  But they're not all powerful, and we're aware, and we're active, and we take action.
[01:48:45.526 --> 01:48:46.866]  We are unstoppable!
[01:48:48.707 --> 01:48:53.969]  There's Trump, President Zelensky of Ukraine, and I had a very good phone call earlier today.
[01:48:53.989 --> 01:48:54.550]  This is today.
[01:48:55.190 --> 01:49:01.393]  He congratulated me on a very successful Republican National Convention, becoming the Republican nominee for President of the United States.
[01:49:03.154 --> 01:49:10.639]  Condemn the heinous assassination attempt last Saturday and remark that the American people coming together is the spirit of unity during these times.
[01:49:11.279 --> 01:49:21.785]  I appreciate President Zelensky for reaching out because I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives in devastated countries and innocent families.
[01:49:22.246 --> 01:49:29.370]  Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity.
[01:49:31.144 --> 01:49:31.284]  U.S.
[01:49:31.304 --> 01:49:34.326]  prepares jamming devices to target Russian and Chinese satellites.
[01:49:35.567 --> 01:49:36.688]  This is what they're hyping up.
[01:49:36.708 --> 01:49:37.588]  This is what they're pushing.
[01:49:38.249 --> 01:49:40.850]  So this is a big, big deal.
[01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:44.012]  So support us at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:49:44.333 --> 01:49:46.694]  If you want back the people fighting tyranny, that's your choice.
[01:49:46.774 --> 01:49:47.475]  I'm not mad at you.
[01:49:47.795 --> 01:49:48.615]  That's between you and God.
[01:49:48.916 --> 01:49:53.959]  But we've got great products you need ready to ship to you at drjonesnaturals.com and infowarsstore.com.
[01:49:53.979 --> 01:49:55.300]  We have the Trump bulletproof shirt.
[01:49:56.587 --> 01:49:58.129]  Right now, go get it.
[01:49:58.289 --> 01:49:59.110]  It's a fundraiser.
[01:49:59.270 --> 01:50:00.172]  It's up to you.
[01:50:00.432 --> 01:50:02.935]  I can't do this without you, and I thank you for your support.
[01:50:02.955 --> 01:50:12.287]  But whatever you do, follow Band.Video, InfoWars.com forward slash show, and follow me at RealLawShows on X, because it's not just this live feed right now that's gonna loop until 4 p.m.
[01:50:12.307 --> 01:50:12.607]  tomorrow.
[01:50:13.547 --> 01:50:18.510]  But also, all the clips of this show that I'm going to go clip out for hours.
[01:50:18.570 --> 01:50:20.311]  I'll be here, fighting on Saturday night.
[01:50:20.891 --> 01:50:23.612]  I'd love to be in a pool or hiking up a hill or eating a great steak.
[01:50:23.972 --> 01:50:24.473]  But you know what?
[01:50:24.533 --> 01:50:25.813]  My wife and children, they can wait.
[01:50:26.394 --> 01:50:27.754]  Because we're going to stop nuclear war.
[01:50:27.794 --> 01:50:28.595]  I've got to defend them.
[01:50:28.635 --> 01:50:29.315]  That's my job.
[01:50:29.555 --> 01:50:30.436]  But I need your support.
[01:50:30.456 --> 01:50:35.018]  I need you to get products at infowarestore.com and drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:50:35.058 --> 01:50:37.660]  Get the bulletproof Trump shirt that's printed right now.
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:38.640]  I'll be shipping out in like a week.
[01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:40.141]  Get it today.
[01:50:41.272 --> 01:50:44.896]  At infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:50:45.837 --> 01:50:46.157]  All right.
[01:50:46.818 --> 01:50:48.760]  Let's now go to Hulk Hogan.
[01:50:49.660 --> 01:50:50.141]  Brief clip.
[01:50:50.501 --> 01:50:52.563]  Then we'll go to Eric Trump, which I believe was the best speech.
[01:50:52.623 --> 01:50:53.264]  Second best speech.
[01:50:54.645 --> 01:50:56.567]  Of course, Tucker Carlson, my good friend.
[01:50:56.667 --> 01:51:01.432]  And then we're going to go to Lou Dobbs, who is with us now in the fight.
[01:51:01.652 --> 01:51:02.013]  Here it is.
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:09.586]  Well brother, as an entertainer, you want to sell tickets, and you really don't want to split your audience.
[01:51:09.626 --> 01:51:12.349]  You don't want to say, I'm a Democrat or I'm a Republican.
[01:51:12.369 --> 01:51:15.051]  You want all kinds of people to come to see you perform.
[01:51:15.812 --> 01:51:19.295]  I stayed silent for so long, it was killing me.
[01:51:19.716 --> 01:51:22.459]  I watched the border crash and burn.
[01:51:22.519 --> 01:51:24.300]  I watched the economy crash and burn.
[01:51:26.122 --> 01:51:28.224]  Trump's family be compromised.
[01:51:28.744 --> 01:51:29.665]  I watched his business.
[01:51:29.705 --> 01:51:31.147]  I watched him try to put him in jail.
[01:51:31.707 --> 01:51:34.509]  I was silent and I hardly could hold my tongue.
[01:51:34.930 --> 01:51:40.975]  And then when they took that shot at him and tried to kill our leader, that was it for me, brother.
[01:51:41.155 --> 01:51:42.216]  I couldn't do it anymore.
[01:51:42.256 --> 01:51:45.859]  But that's why I stayed silent because it was a business decision.
[01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:47.381]  It was a weak decision.
[01:51:47.401 --> 01:51:49.322]  It was a cowardly decision.
[01:51:49.602 --> 01:51:51.564]  But now that's over with, brother.
[01:51:51.624 --> 01:51:52.225]  I'm on the team.
[01:51:55.391 --> 01:52:00.310]   Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome businessman and executive vice president of the Trump
[01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:25.351]  organization, Eric Trump.
[01:52:25.351 --> 01:52:32.591]  Good evening America.
[01:52:32.611 --> 01:52:35.853]  Eight years ago, my father sat our family down.
[01:52:37.354 --> 01:52:46.540]  He spoke of a nation in decline, of dreams slipping away, of a future endangered by failed leadership and broken promises.
[01:52:47.781 --> 01:52:53.084]  It was in that moment I knew my father had made a decision that would forever change our lives.
[01:52:54.281 --> 01:52:56.683]  We realize he had chosen to step into the arena.
[01:52:57.663 --> 01:52:59.905]  To fight for the soul of America.
[01:53:01.206 --> 01:53:05.028]  He decided to leave behind the comforts of an unbelievable business empire.
[01:53:06.329 --> 01:53:08.971]  To leave behind everything he had ever built.
[01:53:09.972 --> 01:53:12.834]  To answer the call to serve our nation.
[01:53:14.675 --> 01:53:19.959]  Unlike his predecessor, it was not a decision born out of necessity.
[01:53:21.525 --> 01:53:26.732]  Unlike the current president, it was not a decision that would enrich his family.
[01:53:28.235 --> 01:53:35.235]   Rather, it was a decision made out of love for this country and a deep concern for America's future.
[01:53:35.235 --> 01:53:54.475]   My father was clear it would not be easy, that there would be a huge price to pay, and that the attacks would be
[01:53:54.475 --> 01:53:55.235]  vicious.
[01:53:55.579 --> 01:53:57.100]  Looking back, that was an understatement.
[01:53:57.961 --> 01:54:17.555]  The made-up Russia hoax, the sham impeachments, the efforts to destroy an unbelievable company, a company that I run today, the efforts to cancel us, to silence him, to gag his free speech, and to drag him through every radical left courthouse in America, to take his life.
[01:54:18.947 --> 01:54:23.027]   Yet through it all, he's shown unwavering courage and determination,
[01:54:23.027 --> 01:54:29.987]   not just in public, but in every private conversation with me and our family.
[01:54:29.987 --> 01:54:37.346]  [Applause]
[01:54:37.346 --> 01:54:45.826]   He stood tall, fueled not by personal ambition, but by a profound love for this country and a love for all
[01:54:45.826 --> 01:54:46.306]  of you.
[01:54:46.306 --> 01:54:56.306]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:54:50.066 --> 01:54:56.714]  That man is the 45th president and soon to be 47th president of the United States.
[01:54:57.796 --> 01:55:01.796]  That man is Donald J. Trump.
[01:55:01.796 --> 01:55:29.796]  [Applause]
[01:55:29.796 --> 01:55:34.235]   Each time I've stood on this stage, America has been a dire crossroads.
[01:55:34.252 --> 01:55:38.115]  In 2016, many people began to doubt the promise of America.
[01:55:39.276 --> 01:55:40.496]  Our economy was struggling.
[01:55:40.557 --> 01:55:41.677]  Jobs were scarce.
[01:55:42.338 --> 01:55:44.640]  Our standing on the world stage was weak at best.
[01:55:45.714 --> 01:55:46.854]  Veterans were forgotten.
[01:55:46.994 --> 01:55:48.595]  Our military was in shambles.
[01:55:49.055 --> 01:55:50.856]  Our educational system was broken.
[01:55:51.636 --> 01:55:52.776]  Ranked 30th in the world.
[01:55:53.996 --> 01:56:02.979]  He could no longer tolerate an inept administration that handed 150 billion dollars to Iran, a country that chants death to America.
[01:56:03.959 --> 01:56:18.651]   Or witness a continued attacks on our Constitution and our religious liberty, or see the disrespect shown to our unbelievable law enforcement officers who are being disarmed, defunded, and persecuted each and every day.
[01:56:22.953 --> 01:56:29.237]  He could no longer stand to see words like Christmas stripped from public use, or the Pledge of Allegiance removed from our schools.
[01:56:30.357 --> 01:56:33.739]  But my father saw potential where others saw despair.
[01:56:34.721 --> 01:56:40.164]  Donald Trump built the New York City skyline.
[01:56:41.825 --> 01:56:45.907]  He did so during a time when businesses were turning away from the city he loved.
[01:56:47.368 --> 01:56:48.328]  Crime was rampant.
[01:56:48.989 --> 01:56:49.969]  The streets were dirty.
[01:56:50.749 --> 01:56:51.850]  But he had the mightiest touch.
[01:56:52.510 --> 01:56:55.272]  And he turned those streets and neighborhoods into gold.
[01:56:56.633 --> 01:56:59.234]  He faced every challenge with tremendous vision and grit.
[01:57:00.226 --> 01:57:02.508]  As he did during the 2016 election.
[01:57:02.788 --> 01:57:03.869]  He rolled up his sleeves.
[01:57:04.229 --> 01:57:05.690]  He remained unapologetic.
[01:57:06.051 --> 01:57:10.051]  He did not care to be politically correct.
[01:57:10.051 --> 01:57:18.051]  [Applause]
[01:57:18.051 --> 01:57:20.051]  He restored hope.
[01:57:20.782 --> 01:57:24.085]  He restored a voice to millions of Americans who had been ignored.
[01:57:25.105 --> 01:57:26.967]  He restored the American dream.
[01:57:28.129 --> 01:57:31.071]  Under my father's leadership, the economy climbed to record heights.
[01:57:31.732 --> 01:57:34.814]  Jobs were created at an unthinkable pace.
[01:57:35.434 --> 01:57:39.197]  Unemployment reached historic lows across all demographics.
[01:57:40.178 --> 01:57:41.239]  Wage growth soared.
[01:57:41.699 --> 01:57:44.201]  He cut taxes for hardworking families and businesses.
[01:57:44.241 --> 01:57:45.802]  He slashed regulations.
[01:57:46.323 --> 01:57:51.283]  We saw the greatest 401k increase in American history.
[01:57:51.283 --> 01:57:57.602]  [Applause]
[01:57:57.602 --> 01:58:02.323]   People bought their first homes in an environment that saw 2-3% interest rates.
[01:58:02.456 --> 01:58:03.936]  They started their families.
[01:58:07.077 --> 01:58:11.716]   My father made the United States energy independent with the lowest gas prices in decades.
[01:58:11.716 --> 01:58:17.077]  [Applause]
[01:58:17.077 --> 01:58:19.556]  My father made the United States safe.
[01:58:19.682 --> 01:58:20.942]  Our borders were closed.
[01:58:20.982 --> 01:58:22.483]  There was peace in the Middle East.
[01:58:22.663 --> 01:58:31.623]  Soleimani, al-Baghdadi, the terrorists were dead.
[01:58:31.623 --> 01:58:36.022]   My father made the United States respected again, with the courage to walk into countries
[01:58:36.022 --> 01:58:41.222]   like North Korea, with the courage to impose tariffs on China, and with the courage to
[01:58:41.222 --> 01:58:45.743]  tear up trade deals that cost Americans their jobs.
[01:58:45.743 --> 01:58:51.182]  [Applause]
[01:58:51.232 --> 01:58:53.153]  He brought manufacturing back to America.
[01:58:53.253 --> 01:58:54.833]  Small businesses flourished.
[01:58:55.194 --> 01:58:56.834]  He did what he promised.
[01:58:57.094 --> 01:58:58.615]  He put America first.
[01:58:59.035 --> 01:59:00.676]  We were winning.
[01:59:00.836 --> 01:59:04.836]  Donald Trump made America great again.
[01:59:04.836 --> 01:59:13.836]  [Applause]
[01:59:13.836 --> 01:59:16.836]  But he also created a movement.
[01:59:16.835 --> 01:59:20.661]  A movement that threatened the special interests and the political elites.
[01:59:21.682 --> 01:59:26.409]  A movement that cast a bright light on the institutions weaponized against the American people.
[01:59:27.590 --> 01:59:28.592]  You see it in our schools.
[01:59:29.193 --> 01:59:31.193]  God bless the moms who fought back.
[01:59:31.193 --> 01:59:38.193]  [Applause]
[01:59:38.193 --> 01:59:40.193]  You see it in your workplace.
[01:59:40.231 --> 01:59:43.092]  You see it on every news station, in every newspaper.
[01:59:43.853 --> 01:59:45.133]  You see it in the military.
[01:59:45.173 --> 01:59:50.795]  The most iconic military installations on planet Earth are stripped of their identity and renamed.
[01:59:51.375 --> 01:59:53.836]  Fort Bragg, Benning, Fort Hood.
[01:59:55.296 --> 01:59:56.396]  You see it in Hollywood.
[01:59:56.416 --> 01:59:58.617]  You see it in our two-tier judicial system.
[01:59:59.037 --> 02:00:01.398]  They don't even hide it anymore.
[02:00:03.496 --> 02:00:04.736]  My father has been censored.
[02:00:04.937 --> 02:00:11.919]  The former president ripped off Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook while terrorist organizations remain intact.
[02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:21.402]  My father has been persecuted, targeted by far-left Democrats, funded by special interest groups, and hand-picked judges.
[02:00:23.383 --> 02:00:34.241]   My father has been pulled off the ballots of states, radical justices attempting to defy the will of millions of Americans who adore who he is, And what he stands for.
[02:00:36.021 --> 02:00:43.285]  My father even became the target of an assassin who almost killed America's single greatest hope for our future.
[02:00:44.866 --> 02:00:49.288]  The swamp is terrified of this incredible movement.
[02:00:50.769 --> 02:00:51.710]  They're terrified of it.
[02:00:52.770 --> 02:00:58.073]  They're terrified of you and the tens of millions of people watching us on TV right now.
[02:00:59.585 --> 02:01:01.266]  They've tried everything to keep him from you.
[02:01:01.506 --> 02:01:02.027]  Everything.
[02:01:02.547 --> 02:01:05.169]  To destroy his legacy, to destroy his family.
[02:01:05.609 --> 02:01:08.691]  They have failed and they will not win.
[02:01:08.511 --> 02:01:24.511]  [applause]
[02:01:24.511 --> 02:01:26.511]  I love my Florida delegation right here.
[02:01:26.511 --> 02:01:35.511]  [applause]
[02:01:35.511 --> 02:01:37.511]  Thank you.
[02:01:37.511 --> 02:01:43.511]   My father stands before you with the most votes of any Republican candidate in the history of our nation.
[02:01:43.511 --> 02:01:45.511]  [applause]
[02:01:46.038 --> 02:01:50.462]  He has defied the predictions of every political pundit.
[02:01:50.522 --> 02:01:52.783]  He fills stadiums across our country.
[02:01:53.104 --> 02:01:58.648]  He energizes Americans to the issues facing this nation, and does so with unvarnished honesty.
[02:01:59.389 --> 02:02:00.950]  He is not a threat to democracy.
[02:02:01.029 --> 02:02:07.069]   He is a threat to those who despise our republic, many of whom are bought and sold, bribed and
[02:02:07.069 --> 02:02:11.750]   coerced, people who have never signed the front of a check and who have been dependent
[02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:23.309]  on the government their entire adult lives.
[02:02:23.309 --> 02:02:26.389]   Today as it was in 2016, America is at that crossroads again.
[02:02:27.078 --> 02:02:28.418]  Energy prices are soaring.
[02:02:28.578 --> 02:02:29.919]  Interest rates are crippling.
[02:02:30.379 --> 02:02:32.159]  Everything is unaffordable.
[02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:33.160]  The U.S.
[02:02:33.180 --> 02:02:34.320]  dollar has been diminished.
[02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:39.081]  Inflation has made it impossible for Americans to live, to save for their future.
[02:02:39.962 --> 02:02:41.502]  Our infrastructure is crumbling.
[02:02:41.602 --> 02:02:43.163]  Our border is out of control.
[02:02:43.783 --> 02:02:47.304]  Millions are dead and displaced in Russia and Ukraine.
[02:02:47.904 --> 02:02:51.445]  A war that has no end and a war that we are funding.
[02:02:52.352 --> 02:02:54.092]  The Middle East has become a hornet's nest.
[02:02:54.613 --> 02:02:57.814]  Our greatest ally, Israel, totally under siege.
[02:02:58.754 --> 02:03:08.657]  Fentanyl is killing our youth and destroying families, while the current administration stands idly by, hoping their inaction will import illegal votes.
[02:03:09.617 --> 02:03:14.478]  Crime terrorizes our cities and our suburbs as far-left policies handcuff police.
[02:03:15.278 --> 02:03:26.278]   Male athletes, guys my height, 6 foot 5, are swimming in women's sports.
[02:03:26.278 --> 02:03:32.957]   Destroying the dreams of young girls who have trained every minute of their lives.
[02:03:33.026 --> 02:03:34.726]  We no longer trust our elections.
[02:03:34.806 --> 02:03:37.147]  We no longer trust our judicial system.
[02:03:37.447 --> 02:03:44.447]   and we no longer believe that our government is working in our best interest.
[02:03:44.447 --> 02:03:53.007]   In spite of where we are today as a nation, I'd like to speak to every American.
[02:03:53.007 --> 02:04:03.007]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:03:54.430 --> 02:03:55.490]  To the homeless veteran.
[02:03:56.279 --> 02:04:02.840]   sleeping under a bridge as illegal immigrants are housed in the most expensive hotels in New York.
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:07.639]  [Booing]
[02:04:07.639 --> 02:04:09.079]  I'm sorry.
[02:04:09.016 --> 02:04:12.016]  We know it's wrong and we will fix it.
[02:04:12.016 --> 02:04:21.516]  [Applause]
[02:04:21.516 --> 02:04:27.817]   To the single mother who can no longer afford her rent, afford groceries, and has been forced to work three jobs,
[02:04:27.817 --> 02:04:29.016]  I'm sorry.
[02:04:29.189 --> 02:04:30.910]  It does not have to be this way.
[02:04:32.871 --> 02:04:44.478]  To the parents who lost a son or daughter to fentanyl, including the incredible woman that spoke the other night, while an administration does absolutely nothing, I'm sorry.
[02:04:44.939 --> 02:04:48.939]  Your government can do so much better, and it will.
[02:04:48.939 --> 02:04:56.939]  [Applause]
[02:04:56.939 --> 02:05:00.939]   To the children who are being brainwashed instead of learning the fundamentals of school,
[02:05:00.939 --> 02:05:02.939]  I'm sorry.
[02:05:02.842 --> 02:05:05.842]  There are teachers who care and my father will empower them.
[02:05:05.842 --> 02:05:13.842]  [Applause]
[02:05:13.842 --> 02:05:20.082]   To the law enforcement officers, our brave Border Patrol, Secret Service agents who work every single day to protect
[02:05:20.082 --> 02:05:23.612]   our communities, knowing damn well that the system will throw you under the
[02:05:23.612 --> 02:05:25.842]  bus, I'm sorry.
[02:05:25.604 --> 02:05:27.604]  We will stand behind you.
[02:05:27.604 --> 02:05:37.203]  [Applause]
[02:05:37.203 --> 02:05:43.923]   To commuters often petrified to take a bus, take a train, or walk the streets in cities across our nation,
[02:05:43.923 --> 02:05:45.204]  I'm sorry.
[02:05:45.146 --> 02:05:52.146]  that man right there will fix this.
[02:05:52.146 --> 02:05:59.186]   To the construction workers, to the middle-class families, to the families with
[02:05:59.186 --> 02:06:03.266]   children with disabilities, families who can no longer afford medical benefits or
[02:06:03.266 --> 02:06:12.067]   to take a vacation, I'm sorry, we will make America great again.
[02:06:12.067 --> 02:06:19.067]  [applause]

[02:06:28.632 --> 02:06:29.333]  I'm sorry.
[02:06:29.712 --> 02:06:36.752]   We know, and America knows, that they're not just after you, they're after all of us, and you just happen to be standing
[02:06:36.752 --> 02:06:37.551]  in their way.
[02:06:37.551 --> 02:07:00.192]  [Applause]
[02:07:00.192 --> 02:07:06.592]   To all Americans watching tonight, the greatest retribution will be our success.
[02:07:06.812 --> 02:07:10.974]  Success not just for ourselves, but for our grandchildren and our children.
[02:07:11.794 --> 02:07:14.175]  Under President Donald J. Trump, the swamp will be drained.
[02:07:14.895 --> 02:07:16.436]  America will be respected.
[02:07:16.876 --> 02:07:18.136]  Our cities will be safe.
[02:07:18.276 --> 02:07:19.797]  Our streets will be clean.
[02:07:19.997 --> 02:07:26.997]  and our border will once again be secure.
[02:07:26.997 --> 02:07:31.676]  We will have peace.
[02:07:32.585 --> 02:07:34.227]  We will have prosperity.
[02:07:34.747 --> 02:07:40.633]  Your hard-earned tax dollars will enrich a better America, not be squandered in corrupt foreign nations.
[02:07:41.554 --> 02:07:43.816]  Education will be handed back to the states.
[02:07:45.018 --> 02:07:47.520]  We will no longer be 30th in the world.
[02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:49.680]  We will be first!
[02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:59.680]  [Applause]

[02:08:46.546 --> 02:08:49.947]  As his son, I've never been more proud of a person in my life.
[02:08:51.288 --> 02:08:54.108]  A man who has defied all odds more than once.
[02:08:55.229 --> 02:08:59.370]  A man who believed in the promise of America when others turned away.
[02:09:00.638 --> 02:09:07.460]  A man who saw a nation in need of a champion and answered that call with unwavering determination and courage.
[02:09:09.020 --> 02:09:16.422]  A man who survived a bullet that was intended to eliminate him permanently from our future and from our family.
[02:09:18.021 --> 02:09:20.301]  Never have I been more proud to be a Trump.
[02:09:20.301 --> 02:09:35.461]  Never have I been more proud to stand by my father's side.
[02:09:36.446 --> 02:09:38.748]  I remain incredibly honored to be part of this journey.
[02:09:39.108 --> 02:09:40.049]  A journey with all of you.
[02:09:40.809 --> 02:09:43.672]  A journey to save the greatest country on earth.
[02:09:44.172 --> 02:09:48.336]  A journey with the most incredible people I have ever met.
[02:09:51.259 --> 02:09:51.579]  Dad.
[02:09:54.161 --> 02:10:03.679]   Five days ago, Laura, Luke, Carolina, and I Held our breath as we saw blood pour across your face.
[02:10:05.962 --> 02:10:13.962]   By the grace of God, divine intervention, and your guardian angels above, you survived.

[02:10:55.901 --> 02:10:59.145]  You are strong, you are full of life, and you are unapologetic.
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.283]  Your optimism is contagious.
[02:11:03.064 --> 02:11:04.746]  Your backbone is unbreakable.
[02:11:05.247 --> 02:11:13.726]   Your conviction to fight for what is right and against all that is wrong is truly next level.
[02:11:13.726 --> 02:11:26.367]  The whole world saw your strength as you stood up.
[02:11:26.434 --> 02:11:28.435]  You wiped the blood off your face.
[02:11:29.175 --> 02:11:37.600]  And you put your fist in the air in a moment that will be remembered as one of the most courageous acts in the history of American politics.
[02:11:38.100 --> 02:11:38.861]  You shouted, Fight!
[02:11:39.281 --> 02:11:39.581]  Fight!
[02:11:39.902 --> 02:11:41.902]  Fight! Fight!
[02:11:41.902 --> 02:11:58.902]  [crowd chanting "Bernie"]
[02:11:58.902 --> 02:12:02.902]  I'm honored to be your son.
[02:12:02.948 --> 02:12:05.288]  I'm honored to speak to our great nation tonight.
[02:12:06.268 --> 02:12:07.289]  You are a true leader.
[02:12:07.949 --> 02:12:09.069]  You have paid my strength.
[02:12:10.149 --> 02:12:11.390]  Our country loves you.
[02:12:12.510 --> 02:12:14.370]  Our country appreciates you.
[02:12:15.531 --> 02:12:17.151]  Our country misses you.
[02:12:18.111 --> 02:12:25.593]  And on November 5th, our country will re-elect you as the 47th President of the United States of America.
[02:12:29.767 --> 02:12:30.790]  Good night Milwaukee!
[02:12:33.176 --> 02:12:35.176]  God bless you all.
[02:12:35.176 --> 02:12:39.176]  [Applause]
[02:12:39.176 --> 02:12:53.176]  [Music]
[02:12:53.176 --> 02:13:16.176]  [Music]
[02:13:16.176 --> 02:13:20.176]  The answer to 1984 is...
[02:13:20.037 --> 02:13:18.917]  1776!
[02:13:20.738 --> 02:13:32.741]  So this fight for America is key, not just for us, but the entire world.
[02:13:32.781 --> 02:13:47.046]   Because if this republic falls, the entire world falls to the UN and the globalists and their hellish plan to literally take everything Well, we got news for them!
[02:13:46.886 --> 02:13:51.886]   away from you. And whether it's Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates or Yuval Noah Harari,
[02:13:51.886 --> 02:13:57.846]   they represent the globalist ruling class of the planet who say the future
[02:13:57.846 --> 02:14:05.605]   is not human. Well we got news for them. The future is not globalist!
[02:14:05.605 --> 02:14:14.286]  The future is human.
[02:14:13.043 --> 02:14:18.844]  The lies they spread about Alex, they've tried to take him out more than they've tried to take any of us out.
[02:14:19.405 --> 02:14:20.485]  But let me tell you what it is.
[02:14:20.525 --> 02:14:33.449]  What they'll never say is that Alex Jones has spent 30 years being the loudest voice for freedom, for liberty, and for anti-war that this world has seen.
[02:14:33.729 --> 02:14:37.390]  He stood against them, and that's why they're against him.
[02:14:38.901 --> 02:14:45.283]  They have tried to burn him to the ground, but he won't stop fighting!
[02:14:45.923 --> 02:14:47.604]  Let's launch Team Humanity!
[02:14:50.565 --> 02:14:51.885]  Team Humanity!
[02:14:54.746 --> 02:14:55.546]  Team Humanity!
[02:14:58.847 --> 02:15:02.288]  Are you gonna let them brainwash and take your children?
[02:15:04.272 --> 02:15:14.537]  The answer to their 1984 anti-human dehumanization world is humanity coming together and celebrating freedom that God gave us and saying no!
[02:15:14.697 --> 02:15:17.318]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[02:15:17.438 --> 02:15:23.741]  So I have a message to the globalists.
[02:15:24.481 --> 02:15:30.664]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[02:15:34.184 --> 02:15:36.506]  They declared war on us.
[02:15:37.367 --> 02:15:38.408]  They're attacking us.
[02:15:38.748 --> 02:15:39.789]  They're surveilling us.
[02:15:40.129 --> 02:15:41.150]  They're censoring us.
[02:15:41.490 --> 02:15:45.193]  They're cutting off our energy, our water, our communications, our freedom.
[02:15:45.514 --> 02:15:49.977]  We're simply recognizing it and saying we're not going to roll over and die.
[02:15:50.398 --> 02:15:55.822]  Our God is the God of the universe that created all and your little God Satan is a loser.
[02:15:56.383 --> 02:16:11.998]   There is a global war The New World Order is a couple thousand arrogant people led by King Charles, who sits around and talks about how he wants to depopulate people, and so did his father, Prince Philip.
[02:16:12.018 --> 02:16:18.104]  And I'm telling them right now, we are not rolling over and dying for you inbred globalists!
[02:16:21.751 --> 02:16:24.638]  He will not divide and conquer us any longer.
[02:16:24.979 --> 02:16:28.979]  And as long as we never give up, we are invincible!

[02:18:13.939 --> 02:18:14.839]  Thank you!
[02:18:18.301 --> 02:18:19.441]  Oh, this is wild!
[02:18:22.443 --> 02:18:22.943]  Thank you!
[02:18:23.023 --> 02:18:28.506]  I've been... Good to see you!
[02:18:30.207 --> 02:18:30.727]  Thank you!
[02:18:32.689 --> 02:18:36.870]  I feel like I know about half the people in the room.
[02:18:36.891 --> 02:18:38.411]  This is wild.
[02:18:40.032 --> 02:18:40.852]  What are you doing?
[02:18:41.352 --> 02:18:42.072]  Justin Welles!
[02:18:42.912 --> 02:18:44.912]  Thank you guys.
[02:18:44.912 --> 02:18:46.912]  [Applause]
[02:18:46.912 --> 02:18:48.912]  Okay.
[02:18:48.912 --> 02:18:52.912]  Can I just say, Peter Navarro is back.
[02:18:53.076 --> 02:18:54.336]  Welcome to Peter Navarro.
[02:18:55.577 --> 02:18:58.638]  Suffering the fate that has happened to so many who are friends with Donald Trump.
[02:18:58.918 --> 02:18:59.938]  Thank you for having me.
[02:18:59.958 --> 02:19:01.699]  I have a...
[02:19:04.573 --> 02:19:05.853]  I have been to many conventions.
[02:19:05.933 --> 02:19:11.114]  I have never been to a more fun convention or a convention with better vibes.
[02:19:13.335 --> 02:19:15.236]  They literally let Navarro out of prison.
[02:19:15.476 --> 02:19:16.436]  First of all, thank you.
[02:19:18.677 --> 02:19:22.157]  This feels a lot different from what I thought it was going to feel like.
[02:19:23.998 --> 02:19:26.239]  I can't hear you, but I know it's something good.
[02:19:26.058 --> 02:19:36.417]   good. So I watched I watched the video of what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania about
[02:19:36.417 --> 02:19:38.698]  1550 times.
[02:19:39.563 --> 02:19:42.564]  I think I was one of about 8 billion people around the world who watched it.
[02:19:43.164 --> 02:19:49.946]  And the more I watched it, the more it struck me that everything was different after that moment.
[02:19:50.446 --> 02:19:50.766]  Everything.
[02:19:50.806 --> 02:19:52.027]  This convention is different.
[02:19:52.547 --> 02:19:53.467]  The nation is different.
[02:19:53.487 --> 02:19:54.268]  The world is different.
[02:19:54.288 --> 02:19:55.548]  Donald Trump is different.
[02:19:56.701 --> 02:20:05.924]  When he stood up after being shot in the face, bloodied, and put his hand up, I thought at that moment, that was a transformation.
[02:20:06.004 --> 02:20:10.386]  This was no longer a man... Well, I think that.
[02:20:10.586 --> 02:20:12.046]  I think it was divine intervention.
[02:20:12.126 --> 02:20:20.569]  But the effect that it had on Donald Trump, he was no longer just a political party's nominee, or a former president, or a future president.
[02:20:21.489 --> 02:20:23.190]  This was the leader of a nation.
[02:20:25.712 --> 02:20:28.614]  And I think there's a difference.
[02:20:29.894 --> 02:20:35.477]  I've spent most of my life in Washington where the president is at the top of the pyramid and everyone wants to be the president.
[02:20:36.418 --> 02:20:38.939]  But if you think about it, the presidency comes with great power, obviously.
[02:20:38.979 --> 02:20:45.583]  But if you think about it, that is a title that is bestowed by a process of some sort that can be subverted.
[02:20:47.364 --> 02:20:53.047]  And in the end, it does not confer by itself, as no title does, legitimacy.
[02:20:54.022 --> 02:20:58.863]  Just because you call yourself the president, doesn't mean that much inherently.
[02:20:58.923 --> 02:21:04.005]  I can call my dog the CEO of Hewlett-Packard, it doesn't mean she is.
[02:21:06.545 --> 02:21:07.466]  You know, it's true.
[02:21:08.846 --> 02:21:14.928]  And you hate to say it, but it is also true, is a fact, that you could take, I don't know, a mannequin, a dead person, and make him president.
[02:21:16.128 --> 02:21:17.148]  If you... No, you could!
[02:21:17.288 --> 02:21:17.728]  You could!
[02:21:17.808 --> 02:21:19.669]  I'm just saying, theoretically possible.
[02:21:21.249 --> 02:21:24.531]  With enough cheating, that could happen.
[02:21:27.172 --> 02:21:30.454]  But being a leader is very different.
[02:21:31.835 --> 02:21:32.595]  It's not a title.
[02:21:33.396 --> 02:21:34.116]  It's organic.
[02:21:35.017 --> 02:21:36.638]  You can't name someone a leader.
[02:21:37.738 --> 02:21:40.580]  A leader is the bravest man.
[02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:42.081]  That's who the leader is.
[02:21:43.447 --> 02:21:46.770]  That is true in all human organizations.
[02:21:47.471 --> 02:21:49.373]  This is a law of nature.
[02:21:50.093 --> 02:21:55.418]  And in that moment, Donald Trump, months before the presidential election, became the leader of this nation.
[02:21:56.760 --> 02:21:58.761]  That was the most obvious to me.
[02:21:59.822 --> 02:22:03.926]  And I have to say, you know, I think it changed him.
[02:22:06.977 --> 02:22:08.918]  Reached out to Trump within hours of it, that night.
[02:22:09.479 --> 02:22:15.543]  And what he said to me that night, having just been shot in the face, he said not a single word about himself.
[02:22:16.824 --> 02:22:21.387]  He said only how amazed he was and how proud he was of the crowd, which didn't run.
[02:22:23.749 --> 02:22:24.810]  And I thought two things.
[02:22:25.650 --> 02:22:28.092]  The first thing I thought was, well, of course they didn't run.
[02:22:29.533 --> 02:22:30.954]  His courage gave them heart.
[02:22:31.194 --> 02:22:33.536]  A leader's courage gives courage to his people.
[02:22:36.394 --> 02:22:41.717]  And the second thing I thought was, this is the selfish guy I've been hearing about for nine years?
[02:22:41.777 --> 02:22:41.997]  Really?
[02:22:42.037 --> 02:22:42.978]  Not a word about himself?
[02:22:44.178 --> 02:22:44.839]  About his people.
[02:22:45.119 --> 02:22:45.559]  Period.
[02:22:46.620 --> 02:22:51.202]  And the second thing I noticed, which I don't think anyone has remarked upon in public, but I'm just going to since I don't have a script, like why not?
[02:22:53.103 --> 02:23:00.067]  Is that he turned down the most obvious opportunity in politics to inflame the nation after being shot.
[02:23:01.189 --> 02:23:07.870]  To inflame the nation, which is an opportunity that almost every other politician I've ever met, and certainly his opponents, would have taken instantly.
[02:23:07.890 --> 02:23:09.791]  And they would have said, well, what is this?
[02:23:10.451 --> 02:23:11.431]  How did he get shot?
[02:23:12.691 --> 02:23:13.452]  How did this happen?
[02:23:14.372 --> 02:23:16.612]  And those are real questions that we have to get to the bottom of.
[02:23:17.172 --> 02:23:23.014]  But in the moments, the days, the week after the shooting, he did not say that.
[02:23:24.294 --> 02:23:25.914]  He did his best to bring the country together.
[02:23:25.934 --> 02:23:28.595]  And I thought, this is the divisive figure, this is the irresponsible person.
[02:23:28.655 --> 02:23:28.815]  No.
[02:23:29.923 --> 02:23:34.727]  This is the most responsible, unifying behavior of a leader I think I've ever seen.
[02:23:34.747 --> 02:23:40.652]  So the question is, where is he leading us?
[02:23:42.053 --> 02:23:44.515]  And I could go on for hours, but let me just sum it up.
[02:23:44.655 --> 02:23:55.664]  I do think the entire point from the famous escalator ride nine years ago until today of Donald Trump's public life has been to remind us of one fact.
[02:23:56.468 --> 02:24:01.230]  Which is, a leader's duty is to his people, to his country, and to no other.
[02:24:01.911 --> 02:24:02.471]  That's the point.
[02:24:02.891 --> 02:24:04.092]  That's the only point.
[02:24:04.532 --> 02:24:07.134]  And another word for this is democracy.
[02:24:08.014 --> 02:24:18.039]  Democracy, in case you're a little sick of being beaten in the face with democracy on television, actual democracy is the proposition that the citizens of a country own that country.
[02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:22.642]  They're not renters, they're not serfs, they're not slaves, they are the owners of the country.
[02:24:23.602 --> 02:24:33.573]   And for that to be true, Their leaders have to represent them, which is another way of saying they have to do what the people want them to do.
[02:24:34.813 --> 02:24:36.954]  Or a close approximation thereof.
[02:24:37.714 --> 02:24:47.417]  But if they completely ignore what people want, not just one year, but generationally, say for 50 years, then it may be, I don't know what, it's not a democracy.
[02:24:48.357 --> 02:24:54.719]  And so I think the entire Trump project, paradoxically, he's attacked as an enemy of democracy, is to return democracy to the United States.
[02:24:56.693 --> 02:25:00.337]  Let's pay attention to what people actually want.
[02:25:02.459 --> 02:25:07.684]  And the lack of interest in that question in Washington is something that ultimately drove me out of the city after 35 years.
[02:25:08.585 --> 02:25:17.615]  Lawmakers stepping over the prostrate bodies of their fellow citizens OD'ing on drugs to go cast votes to send money to some foreign country.
[02:25:19.793 --> 02:25:20.573]  Yeah, actually.
[02:25:21.313 --> 02:25:27.735]  We've lost more Americans from drugs in the past four years than we lost in World War II.
[02:25:29.076 --> 02:25:29.276]  Yeah.
[02:25:30.336 --> 02:25:31.157]  Our bloodiest war.
[02:25:31.317 --> 02:25:32.797]  More than we lost in World War II.
[02:25:35.158 --> 02:25:35.958]  Does anybody care?
[02:25:37.178 --> 02:25:37.919]  It is pathetic.
[02:25:38.079 --> 02:25:38.779]  It is pathetic.
[02:25:39.639 --> 02:25:43.340]  And do you hear a single word from Washington about doing anything about it?
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:44.501]  We know where the drugs are coming from.
[02:25:44.961 --> 02:25:45.881]  We know the supply routes.
[02:25:45.901 --> 02:25:46.201]  The U.S.
[02:25:46.241 --> 02:25:48.442]  military spent billions bombing the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
[02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:55.144]  You don't see our commander-in-chief suggesting that we use our military to protect our country, or the lives of its citizens.
[02:25:55.304 --> 02:25:55.544]  No!
[02:25:56.505 --> 02:25:57.285]  That's for Ukraine!
[02:25:58.466 --> 02:25:59.707]  And it's too much, actually.
[02:25:59.727 --> 02:26:00.628]  It's too insulting.
[02:26:01.969 --> 02:26:02.809]  It's too insulting.
[02:26:03.149 --> 02:26:05.331]  It's a middle finger in the face of every American.
[02:26:05.791 --> 02:26:10.474]  It's a very clear statement, which is unmistakable.
[02:26:11.375 --> 02:26:13.517]  And that is, we don't care about you.
[02:26:15.998 --> 02:26:20.988]   And Donald Trump, Whatever you say about him, and I think he's a wonderful person, I know him well.
[02:26:21.148 --> 02:26:24.309]  By the way, the funniest person I've ever met in my life, actually.
[02:26:25.109 --> 02:26:28.491]  You can't be funny without perspective, or without empathy, which is true.
[02:26:30.271 --> 02:26:32.792]  But everything else about Trump aside, he actually cares.
[02:26:33.432 --> 02:26:36.813]  Because he's interested in the people who live here, because that's his job.
[02:26:37.194 --> 02:26:39.634]  A father's job, his duty is to his family.
[02:26:40.895 --> 02:26:43.716]  An officer's duty is to his men, a president's duty is to his citizens.
[02:26:45.336 --> 02:26:47.237]  And he seems to be the only one who thinks that.
[02:26:48.993 --> 02:26:51.855]  And in his choice for Vice President, J.D.
[02:26:51.955 --> 02:26:53.576]  Vance, he's made that really clear!
[02:26:55.978 --> 02:26:56.258]  J.D.
[02:26:56.338 --> 02:27:06.646]  Vance, I'll say this about him, is a thoroughly decent man, and I'll just admit it, a friend of mine, one of the very few politicians in Washington who actually is very close to his own wife, which is wonderful to see.
[02:27:06.666 --> 02:27:10.889]  And she's wonderful, actually.
[02:27:12.196 --> 02:27:12.756]  But J.D.
[02:27:12.856 --> 02:27:19.038]  Vance has views that are closer to Trump's voters than anyone else in Washington in office.
[02:27:19.858 --> 02:27:22.318]  Therefore, he is the Vice President.
[02:27:22.338 --> 02:27:23.519]  That's called democracy.
[02:27:26.279 --> 02:27:27.600]  So I will stop on just one point.
[02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:30.620]  And that is, what's happened over the past month?
[02:27:31.941 --> 02:27:32.601]  Since the debate?
[02:27:35.854 --> 02:27:40.695]  And particularly on Saturday in Butler, I think a lot of people are wondering, what is this?
[02:27:40.715 --> 02:27:42.416]  This doesn't look like politics.
[02:27:42.856 --> 02:27:44.136]  Something bigger is going on here.
[02:27:44.196 --> 02:27:48.618]  I think even people who don't believe in God are beginning to think, well, maybe there's something to this.
[02:27:50.118 --> 02:27:50.618]  Actually.
[02:27:52.639 --> 02:27:57.640]  And I'm starting to think, I'm starting to think it's going to be okay, actually.
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:27:58.521]  I do think that.
[02:27:59.941 --> 02:28:06.684]   The day after the midterm elections in 2018, Antifa came to my house.
[02:28:07.965 --> 02:28:09.806]  The Democratic Party's militia, okay?
[02:28:09.826 --> 02:28:10.387]  I was at work.
[02:28:10.427 --> 02:28:12.148]  It was obvious when I was at work because it was public.
[02:28:12.549 --> 02:28:13.429]  My wife was home alone.
[02:28:13.650 --> 02:28:14.750]  They tried to come in through the front door.
[02:28:14.770 --> 02:28:15.531]  They terrorized her.
[02:28:16.292 --> 02:28:17.232]  She hid in our pantry.
[02:28:17.633 --> 02:28:18.173]  It was on television.
[02:28:18.213 --> 02:28:19.354]  It was horrible, actually.
[02:28:20.095 --> 02:28:21.436]  It was... I mean, I'm not whining about it.
[02:28:21.856 --> 02:28:23.778]  It wasn't getting shot in the face, but it wrecked our day.
[02:28:25.719 --> 02:28:33.926]  And the next morning, we're lying in bed, and the phone rings for my wife, and it's Donald Trump, who's not like a regular text buddy of Donald Trump's.
[02:28:35.017 --> 02:28:35.797]  She picks it up, hello?
[02:28:37.198 --> 02:28:38.019]  Susie, it's Donald Trump!
[02:28:38.439 --> 02:28:39.559]  And it's coming through, I can hear it!
[02:28:39.819 --> 02:28:40.900]  And I'm lying in bed, whoa!
[02:28:42.421 --> 02:28:44.662]  And the first thing he says is, I'm gonna stand guard outside your house.
[02:28:46.343 --> 02:28:47.983]  And she goes, oh, that's so nice.
[02:28:49.044 --> 02:28:51.225]  And he says, I'll never forget this as long as I live.
[02:28:51.445 --> 02:28:52.966]  He says, you know, there's a lot of hate out there.
[02:28:53.486 --> 02:28:54.927]  And she said, you know, there is, Mr. President.
[02:28:55.507 --> 02:28:57.748]  And then he says, but there's a lot of love.
[02:28:58.489 --> 02:28:59.369]  There's a lot of love.
[02:29:01.410 --> 02:29:02.911]  And we are seeing that love.
[02:29:04.082 --> 02:29:05.443]  I don't think it's human love.
[02:29:09.266 --> 02:29:10.427]  And I'll just stop with this.
[02:29:10.687 --> 02:29:12.548]  I'm not always convinced that I'm on the right side.
[02:29:12.588 --> 02:29:14.150]  I've been on the wrong side many times.
[02:29:14.650 --> 02:29:19.694]  You'll never hear me say I'm on God's side, or God's with me, or even I'm with God.
[02:29:20.414 --> 02:29:20.955]  I want to be.
[02:29:21.395 --> 02:29:22.035]  Not sure I am.
[02:29:22.776 --> 02:29:25.158]  But I will say this unequivocally and conclusively.
[02:29:25.618 --> 02:29:28.080]  God is among us right now.
[02:29:30.161 --> 02:29:31.202]  And I think that's enough.
[02:29:32.643 --> 02:29:33.264]  God bless you.
[02:29:37.406 --> 02:29:40.732]  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Golf General Manager.
[02:29:44.619 --> 02:29:47.043]  Hello everybody and welcome to the Great America Show.
[02:29:47.063 --> 02:29:48.085]  Great to have you with us.
[02:29:48.786 --> 02:29:52.970]  Newly elected RNC Chairman Michael Watley making waves.
[02:29:53.010 --> 02:29:58.054]  He's only been in the job for about a month and already making a bit of a splash.
[02:29:58.975 --> 02:30:08.523]  Watley ran for chair on the pledge, the very specific pledge, that he would spend every day of 2024 trying to elect Donald Trump.
[02:30:09.238 --> 02:30:11.280]  Watley already breaking that pledge.
[02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:15.963]  He has taken on the role of protecting Speaker Mike Johnson.
[02:30:16.443 --> 02:30:22.207]  Politico reports that Watley has been briefing House Republicans on the importance of party unity.
[02:30:22.688 --> 02:30:34.916]  They also reported that he sent a warning message to Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is, as you know, trying to, well, to get Mike Johnson thrown out of the job of Speaker.
[02:30:35.457 --> 02:30:38.739]  Saying, don't move against Johnson, Watley warned.
[02:30:39.723 --> 02:30:41.264]  That's really quite a statement.
[02:30:41.324 --> 02:31:03.212]  And by the way, you know, it also suggests that maybe, just maybe, President Trump is influencing Whatley's direction on this, which is further interesting because if they were to proceed with Marjorie Taylor Greene's attempt at an ouster, it would be bedlam in the House.
[02:31:03.272 --> 02:31:07.794]  And that is the last thing, frankly, the Republican conference needs.
[02:31:07.854 --> 02:31:17.340]   And by the way, The reality is, you know, I would love to see Mike Johnson the heck out of there, but this just isn't the time.
[02:31:17.400 --> 02:31:21.663]  And by the way, they're not going to get much done in the next five or six months anyway.
[02:31:22.383 --> 02:31:25.526]  I do want to turn to a couple of interesting developments here today.
[02:31:26.066 --> 02:31:28.408]  Obama trash talking President Trump.
[02:31:29.068 --> 02:31:32.611]  President Trump, he says, is not considered a serious guy.
[02:31:32.631 --> 02:31:37.334]  Obama's saying, I mean, he comes from New York.
[02:31:37.874 --> 02:31:41.776]  He says there's nobody in New York who does business with him or lends him money.
[02:31:42.256 --> 02:31:50.439]  He's not considered a serious guy here, Obama, the former community organizer said of President Trump.
[02:31:50.819 --> 02:31:53.420]  You know, I can't believe this guy, Obama.
[02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.681]  Obama is a lightweight if there ever was a lightweight.
[02:31:56.721 --> 02:31:59.522]  He's nothing but a mouthpiece for the Marxist Dems.
[02:32:00.183 --> 02:32:05.345]  He's not even, frankly, in tune with what is serious and what is not.
[02:32:05.825 --> 02:32:14.369]  All he's about is actually trying to destroy the Republic with his third term in office thanks to Joe Biden, the puppet president.
[02:32:16.589 --> 02:32:18.010]  Talking trash about Trump.
[02:32:18.630 --> 02:32:19.590]  He looks pathetic.
[02:32:20.550 --> 02:32:26.552]  And by the way, President Trump on a really bad day has pocket change that amounts to his net worth.
[02:32:26.992 --> 02:32:32.994]  And he had to, you know, really work hard for $200 million or so that he's got, Obama did.
[02:32:33.694 --> 02:32:40.716]  And another just a beautiful story, a Michigan senator with stunning video warning everybody.
[02:32:41.236 --> 02:32:56.327]  About a bill that the Democratic Legislature, the Democrat Senators just passed in Michigan, that will be, as he put it, an explosion of election fraud, saying it will not allow a recount, will bar investigations into election fraud.
[02:32:56.727 --> 02:33:00.650]  That is what I call a Marxist dream come true in Michigan.
[02:33:01.010 --> 02:33:04.773]  And good going, Michigan Senators.
[02:33:04.813 --> 02:33:11.879]  You know, you've run another game and this just is a reminder that they're going to try to cheat all the way down the line.
[02:33:11.899 --> 02:33:25.349]  And by the way, speaking of President Trump, I talked to President Trump today and I have to tell you, I was calling him to kid about his day off from the trial in New York and just, you know, see how he's doing.
[02:33:26.152 --> 02:33:32.556]  And then he reminded me that he had just two rallies today on his day off.
[02:33:32.997 --> 02:33:37.400]  He's on his way now to Michigan.
[02:33:38.180 --> 02:33:45.785]  Earlier he had been in Wisconsin and he was talking to me about how much energy and enthusiasm there is.
[02:33:46.245 --> 02:33:55.634]   He said it's much bigger, much bigger than last time and I want you to know President Trump is feeling very, very good personally.
[02:33:55.714 --> 02:33:56.796]  His health is excellent.
[02:33:57.637 --> 02:34:01.141]  And he thinks the country is going to be saved.
[02:34:02.202 --> 02:34:08.130]  And that means in my, at least, interpretation, he thinks he's got a winner in 2024.
[02:34:08.230 --> 02:34:09.993]  Let's make sure that he does.
[02:34:11.354 --> 02:34:14.496]  Spirits are high, his and mine, and I hope yours.
[02:34:14.956 --> 02:34:17.057]  And I know Alex Jones' spirits are high.
[02:34:17.898 --> 02:34:22.801]  Alex Jones is one of the icons in this country, a terrific American.
[02:34:23.401 --> 02:34:28.485]  And fortunately, he and I get along, and we are friends.
[02:34:29.025 --> 02:34:29.625]  And you know what?
[02:34:29.905 --> 02:34:35.069]  It's my turn to have him on as a guest next time he has to put up with me.
[02:34:36.229 --> 02:34:45.651]  Alex Jones and I, taking up the issues that confront the country, and indeed may determine whether or not this republic succeeds.
[02:34:46.191 --> 02:34:49.972]  Talking today with the great American, Alex Jones.
[02:34:51.332 --> 02:34:53.012]  And now with us, Alex Jones.
[02:34:53.092 --> 02:34:55.253]  And Alex, it's always a pleasure to see you.
[02:34:55.293 --> 02:34:56.433]  Thanks for being here.
[02:34:56.613 --> 02:35:01.214]  And, you know, I'll tell you what, let's just drive the left nuts here for a little while.
[02:35:01.234 --> 02:35:01.714]  What do you think?
[02:35:02.611 --> 02:35:06.376]  Well, the two of us already do it, so just the combination's got to be horrible.
[02:35:07.077 --> 02:35:09.500]  Well, I want to start with just the situation.
[02:35:09.660 --> 02:35:14.266]  You know, the old condition, What Condition My Conditions In, I think it was first edition.
[02:35:15.467 --> 02:35:20.654]  It was a great song, but I have to say, what condition do you see this country in?
[02:35:22.170 --> 02:35:31.719]  We are at the absolute crossroads of globalism versus freedom that you pioneered with Ron Paul decades and decades ago exposing.
[02:35:32.039 --> 02:35:34.542]  I don't want to say we've been vindicated, but we really have.
[02:35:34.602 --> 02:35:39.426]  It's kind of sad to be vindicated that we've mitigated some of the tyranny, but it's still basically all here.
[02:35:39.506 --> 02:35:46.193]  Global government, central bank digital currencies, totally open borders, the media praising Hezbollah.
[02:35:47.114 --> 02:35:47.854]  And Hamas.
[02:35:47.914 --> 02:35:50.357]  I mean, it is just an insane moment.
[02:35:50.577 --> 02:35:58.725]  And we know the end of the old monetary system of the private Federal Reserve and the central banks, the Bank of International Settlements.
[02:35:59.205 --> 02:36:00.446]  That's all coming to an end.
[02:36:00.486 --> 02:36:02.588]  Their old Ponzi scheme is coming to an end, finally.
[02:36:02.608 --> 02:36:09.455]  And they're trying to segue into central bank digital currencies and the cashless society, like the CEO of Bank of America said a few days ago.
[02:36:10.578 --> 02:36:16.583]  A system with the IRS, with AI, tracking every purchase warrantlessly, totally illegally.
[02:36:17.084 --> 02:36:22.689]  So if people think we've been living in 1984, that was just the warm-up, but...
[02:36:23.689 --> 02:36:31.234]  It's not just Lou Dobbs, who 20 years ago was the only person in the media of any stature covering what was happening and predicting it.
[02:36:31.294 --> 02:36:43.081]  Now we're living it, and I see Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, but hundreds of other prominent hosts, all the most popular hosts, sound just like Lou Dobbs 20 years ago, 15 years ago, or six, seven years ago on Fox Business.
[02:36:43.101 --> 02:37:02.774]   So, the New World Order has silenced a lot of people, they've cut the legs out from a lot of people, but we just keep coming back and They've had really a pyrrhic victory, and so that's where we are at a major crossroads in the next 188 days until this election, really deciding what we're going to do.
[02:37:02.814 --> 02:37:13.200]  And then the Democrats, with their movie Civil War, and Obama has a show on Netflix about Civil War, and all these professors in the LA Times and the New York Times saying, Civil War is going to happen.
[02:37:13.220 --> 02:37:13.801]  Well, no it's not.
[02:37:14.121 --> 02:37:20.943]   They're planning a leftist BLM Islamic communist uprising that they're already starting to
[02:37:20.943 --> 02:37:25.112]   activate and they've said they have bills introduced as you know to really a
[02:37:25.112 --> 02:37:29.473]   legislative coup against executive that Trump won't be able to declare the insurrection
[02:37:29.473 --> 02:37:32.652]   act that George Herbert Walker Bush rightfully did and I wasn't a fan of
[02:37:32.652 --> 02:37:38.273]   him during the LA riots in the early 1990s before he left office, before he was defeated by Bill Clinton.
[02:37:38.613 --> 02:37:44.874]  They're saying, when we have an uprising, it's a legitimate, mostly peaceful, you know, thing, and we're going to not let him use the military.
[02:37:45.254 --> 02:37:50.254]   Just like it's now confirmed in congressional hearings, Trump did want 10,000 National Guard on January 6th
[02:37:50.254 --> 02:37:53.693]   and Milley basically blocked it and Trump never overrode him.
[02:37:53.693 --> 02:37:57.334]  So they're really, people think things are crazy now.
[02:37:57.334 --> 02:38:02.574]   We have basically, not basically, we have the weathermen 2.0, Obama,
[02:38:02.574 --> 02:38:05.213]  his third unelected term.
[02:38:05.213 --> 02:38:08.734]   I believe he was elected the first two, but he's obviously behind Obama.
[02:38:08.734 --> 02:38:15.972]   Literally carrying out their weathermen fantasies that they have the 60s, 70s, and 80s now.
[02:38:15.772 --> 02:38:20.932]   So I cannot overstress to people how epically bat bleep crazy,
[02:38:20.932 --> 02:38:26.812]   because right before we went live you were saying that, this country and the world is bat bleep crazy and it's a
[02:38:26.812 --> 02:38:30.211]   paradox where those of us that exposed it have all the credibility
[02:38:30.211 --> 02:38:34.852]   and then those that are doing it have no credibility but are in control of the Justice Department
[02:38:34.852 --> 02:38:36.212]  and the nuclear weapons.
[02:38:36.212 --> 02:38:42.451]   And so I just cannot stress that this is everything that Ronald Reagan talked about.
[02:38:42.451 --> 02:38:47.131]   We talked about the Globalist, the Toronto Commission, everything that Barry Goldwater talked about and then you
[02:38:47.131 --> 02:38:50.351]  and Ron Paul, you know, decades out.
[02:38:50.351 --> 02:38:53.072]  But now the denial is over because we're here.
[02:38:53.072 --> 02:38:58.372]   Yeah, we are here and we're in the center of what appears
[02:38:58.372 --> 02:39:00.951]  to be a societal conflagration.
[02:39:01.575 --> 02:39:03.356]  We are watching everything.
[02:39:03.716 --> 02:39:14.439]  This is an explosion of values that no longer seem relevant or certainly under attack, as we sit here.
[02:39:16.211 --> 02:39:19.673]  And you mentioned globalism versus freedom.
[02:39:20.354 --> 02:39:22.975]  And I think that's a great way to look at it.
[02:39:24.076 --> 02:39:36.002]  The problem with it is freedom is just being so assaulted now in what was the bastion of freedom and liberty, the United States of America.
[02:39:36.022 --> 02:39:40.945]  I don't know if you notice this, but I mean, I've noticed the media doesn't even refer to the United States.
[02:39:41.545 --> 02:39:43.446]  They talk about America grudgingly.
[02:39:44.304 --> 02:39:47.107]  But they never use the expression United States.
[02:39:47.808 --> 02:39:52.493]  And I think that that is in part a reflection of their psyches.
[02:39:52.573 --> 02:39:56.917]  They mean for there to be no states united whatsoever.
[02:39:57.318 --> 02:39:58.299]  They are divisive.
[02:39:58.399 --> 02:39:59.420]  They're polarizing.
[02:39:59.560 --> 02:40:06.407]  And as you said, there is an impulse within everything the Marxist left does in this country.
[02:40:07.385 --> 02:40:21.657]  That is directed toward destruction of American values, destruction of the nation state itself, the destruction of the constitution, and this constitutional republic is under such assault.
[02:40:21.777 --> 02:40:25.099]  And I think it's fair to ask the question, will we survive it?
[02:40:26.040 --> 02:40:30.984]  Because right now we are in such a stalemate.
[02:40:31.750 --> 02:40:47.003]  With the left, that is, we the people, are in a sailmate with the Marxist left because they intend tyranny, they intend totalitarianism, and they intend for us not to be we the people and provide consent of the governed.
[02:40:47.523 --> 02:41:00.394]  They intend for us to simply be consumers, taxpayers, we'll be units of labor, but we sure to hell are not going to be citizens of any constitutional republic.
[02:41:01.294 --> 02:41:05.918]  In the view of the left, and that is what they're working toward every single day.
[02:41:06.479 --> 02:41:35.385]   And most of the Republican Party, which is still the only countervailing influence of any significance in the country politically, there's just no question that the Republican Party isn't even awake to what is in What is pretended here by the spokesman of the left and primarily Barack Obama, as he talked about the fundamental transformation of America.
[02:41:35.425 --> 02:41:36.166]  We're witnessing it.
[02:41:36.286 --> 02:41:36.907]  We're living it.
[02:41:37.487 --> 02:41:43.654]  And people are only now begrudgingly acknowledging that reality as they look at Donald Trump.
[02:41:44.346 --> 02:41:58.291]  A former president, future president, and how he is being just crushed by the Marxist left in a lawfare society of legal terrorists.
[02:41:59.011 --> 02:42:02.032]  That's the only way I could describe what he's going through.
[02:42:02.732 --> 02:42:11.215]  We're talking with Alex Jones and we're going to come right back and take up exactly what condition America's condition is really in.
[02:42:11.695 --> 02:42:12.155]  Really in.
[02:42:12.830 --> 02:42:14.191]  We'll be back with Alex Jones.
[02:42:15.371 --> 02:42:16.812]  We're back now with Alex Jones.
[02:42:16.872 --> 02:42:20.073]  And Alex, we were talking, we touched upon banks.
[02:42:20.593 --> 02:42:25.175]  We're watching First Republic and Philadelphia collapse the other day.
[02:42:25.695 --> 02:42:29.036]  We went through the same thing at about the same period last year.
[02:42:29.856 --> 02:42:36.695]   We're now watching a Federal Reserve that doesn't have any sense of where it is.
[02:42:36.695 --> 02:42:42.336]   We're looking at a Federal Reserve that is stubbornly hanging on to 2% inflation as their
[02:42:42.336 --> 02:42:50.176]   targets, while the inflation rate is, well, month to month it is over 3% over the past
[02:42:50.176 --> 02:42:51.176]  six months.
[02:42:51.176 --> 02:42:53.617]  It is not moving down.
[02:42:53.702 --> 02:42:54.622]  It's moving higher.
[02:42:55.343 --> 02:43:00.467]  And the Fed isn't talking about even their balance sheet, which they have to run off $8 trillion.
[02:43:00.987 --> 02:43:10.335]  They are watching a market that is, frankly, right now, trying to figure out whether it's going to crash or whether it's going to prosper.
[02:43:10.810 --> 02:43:15.931]   uh... and right now it's uh... it's under significant pressure i think it's
[02:43:15.931 --> 02:43:19.950]   fair to say and capital is being shipped out to china faster than
[02:43:19.950 --> 02:43:23.030]   capital can be accumulated in america
[02:43:23.030 --> 02:43:27.230]   this does not take an economic genius to figure out this country is on a wayward
[02:43:27.230 --> 02:43:31.751]   path that leads only to more uh... travail
[02:43:31.751 --> 02:43:35.911]   i was about to say people forget you're not just a top top talk show host
[02:43:36.262 --> 02:43:40.605]  You used to head up CNN back when it was the top thing in the country, in the world.
[02:43:41.065 --> 02:43:44.888]  You know finances and you're an expert looking at it and saying it's totally screwed.
[02:43:45.089 --> 02:43:52.887]   I'm not an expert, but I know the same steakhouse Three years ago that I get a really great steak for $40 is $100 now.
[02:43:52.907 --> 02:43:55.188]  And I can barely afford that.
[02:43:55.228 --> 02:43:56.389]  The general public can.
[02:43:56.409 --> 02:44:02.011]  And I see the gas prices and I see what a package of bacon or eggs costs.
[02:44:02.070 --> 02:44:07.630]   and I talked to families that have degrees and work two jobs and they can't pay their bills.
[02:44:07.630 --> 02:44:09.191]  They can't go on vacation.
[02:44:09.191 --> 02:44:11.870]   And Biden tried to tell us two years ago there was no inflation.
[02:44:11.870 --> 02:44:13.111]  Then he said, well, it's low.
[02:44:13.111 --> 02:44:14.790]  Well, now we've beaten inflation.
[02:44:14.790 --> 02:44:16.790]  No, now it's worse than ever.
[02:44:16.790 --> 02:44:19.470]  And that's really the deciding factor.
[02:44:19.470 --> 02:44:21.470]  And we have this old financial order.
[02:44:21.470 --> 02:44:24.930]   As you said, the private federal reserve doesn't know what to do right now.
[02:44:24.930 --> 02:44:26.550]  Everything they do turns to crap.
[02:44:26.550 --> 02:44:28.150]  It's coming to an end.
[02:44:28.150 --> 02:44:33.030]   And so the big question is, what are they going to try to do to extricate themselves
[02:44:33.030 --> 02:44:33.870]  from this?
[02:44:33.870 --> 02:44:39.230]   And the answer is civil unrest, billing civil war as really a communist uprising.
[02:44:39.230 --> 02:44:41.469]  And I really believe it's already begun.
[02:44:41.469 --> 02:44:42.911]  And then they say they're going to do this.
[02:44:42.911 --> 02:44:44.649]  They're going to drive Trump from power.
[02:44:44.649 --> 02:44:50.550]   If he's reelected, they are actually going to try to burn the country down in 188 days
[02:44:50.550 --> 02:44:52.191]  while he's president elect.
[02:44:52.322 --> 02:44:55.522]   according to the Washington Post, New York Times, that's their strategy.
[02:44:55.522 --> 02:45:01.641]   They've got legislation introduced, as I said earlier, to pull the military power from Trump domestically.
[02:45:01.641 --> 02:45:06.362]   And I know I got a thousand topics to cover, but I go back to that, Lou, because that's a coup.
[02:45:06.362 --> 02:45:11.001]   When they introduced legislation in the Senate to pull the power of the president over the military,
[02:45:11.001 --> 02:45:16.762]   and they've introduced legislation to have an inspector general over the Supreme Court,
[02:45:16.762 --> 02:45:22.602]   that is the most unpopular branch of government, the legislative, with all these Democrat lawyers
[02:45:22.602 --> 02:45:26.361]   and RINO collaborators, trying to take over the Supreme Court,
[02:45:26.361 --> 02:45:28.881]  trying to take the military power from the president.
[02:45:28.881 --> 02:45:32.322]  We're not approaching a coup, we're in the middle of one.
[02:45:32.322 --> 02:45:36.081]   And I don't say that to be negative, but it would be a lie if I didn't say it.
[02:45:36.081 --> 02:45:38.842]  It's positive to admit the truth.
[02:45:38.911 --> 02:45:43.232]  I forget which founding father said, I want to know the whole truth and make preparations for it.
[02:45:43.252 --> 02:45:44.853]  I think it was Patrick Henry.
[02:45:44.893 --> 02:45:47.073]  He said, you know, why sit we here idle?
[02:45:47.113 --> 02:45:48.013]  The war has already begun.
[02:45:48.033 --> 02:45:49.994]  I'm not calling for physical confrontation.
[02:45:50.034 --> 02:46:22.096]   I'm simply saying there needs to be a sense of urgency with populists and capitalists and conservatives and people that just aren't insane to understand that Everything that was warned of is now here and we have to reach out, I think, to the smarter people, the whistleblowers, people in government and corporations and say, now is the time for you to speak out and say no and not follow these orders because any corrupt dictatorship, any corrupt oligarchy or plutocracy, when it's in trouble, is going to try to outlaw its opposition.
[02:46:22.116 --> 02:46:27.850]   I forget the exact Orwell quote, but he basically said, Tyranny's come in based on lies.
[02:46:28.351 --> 02:46:31.192]  But then once the lies are exposed, all that is left is force.
[02:46:31.893 --> 02:46:33.814]  And so we're now at the force point.
[02:46:34.514 --> 02:46:40.297]  And I want listeners to understand, the FBI and others have been caught trying to kidnap Whitmer and provocateur events.
[02:46:40.878 --> 02:46:43.679]  And there's provocateurs out there saying violence is the answer.
[02:46:43.719 --> 02:46:45.580]  And I don't see conservatives buying that.
[02:46:46.061 --> 02:46:48.442]  But the point is, that is not where we win.
[02:46:48.862 --> 02:46:50.223]  We have to win intellectually.
[02:46:50.443 --> 02:46:51.564]  We're winning intellectually.
[02:46:51.944 --> 02:46:53.225]  That's why they want to make it physical.
[02:46:53.265 --> 02:46:55.206]  But you go see the movie Civil War.
[02:46:56.317 --> 02:46:59.599]  Conservatives said, oh, they don't say who the good guys and bad guys are.
[02:47:00.220 --> 02:47:01.481]  This movie's not that bad.
[02:47:01.701 --> 02:47:22.635]  I went and saw it, and literally it's a Trumpian figure who is actually racist, and you've got white people executing Asians and blacks and others, and then there's an uprising where they take over the White House and all the Secret Service's old white men and they kill them, and then they execute the Trumpian figure, and there's a new America.
[02:47:24.077 --> 02:47:27.998]  The American flag falling and the monuments in D.C.
[02:47:28.018 --> 02:47:28.698]  being blown up.
[02:47:28.978 --> 02:47:32.419]  And then you learn at the end, they're the good guys doing it.
[02:47:33.079 --> 02:47:39.400]  And it's completely racial where this black liberal commando woman executes the Trump figure.
[02:47:39.900 --> 02:47:42.481]  Hollywood is telegraphing what they're planning.
[02:47:42.521 --> 02:47:53.001]   So I don't want to be doom and gloom here, but I also can't lie to people that the communists, the globalists, the Soroses, know that they are losing the hearts and minds, including
[02:47:53.001 --> 02:47:56.361]   what, triple the number of blacks, double the number of Hispanics voting for Trump.
[02:47:56.361 --> 02:47:59.401]   They really get their prosperities under attack, their freedoms under attack.
[02:47:59.401 --> 02:48:01.321]  So there is a desperate move.
[02:48:01.321 --> 02:48:06.401]   And I believe they're going to try a racial conflict, the Hezbollah, Hamas garbage.
[02:48:06.401 --> 02:48:07.401]  That's already going on.
[02:48:07.401 --> 02:48:14.161]   But they're also going to try to, I think, trigger the financial crisis either right
[02:48:14.161 --> 02:48:17.361]  after Trump gets elected or right before.
[02:48:17.628 --> 02:48:20.710]  And Trump even said, gosh, I hope the collapse happens before I get in.
[02:48:20.990 --> 02:48:23.692]  He goes, I'm not for the collapse, but at least then I don't get blamed.
[02:48:23.732 --> 02:48:24.332]  I can fix it.
[02:48:24.752 --> 02:48:29.356]  So people need to understand we are not in a normal situation.
[02:48:29.396 --> 02:48:32.318]  We are in a historical moment right now.
[02:48:32.518 --> 02:48:41.115]   And there's a normalcy bias where a lot of conservatives, as you were mentioning earlier, I don't realize how incredibly dangerous this is.
[02:48:42.015 --> 02:48:43.697]  Yeah, there's no question about it.
[02:48:44.237 --> 02:48:52.063]  Alex, to think that we're sitting here with 30, approaching now 37, $37 trillion in debt.
[02:48:52.663 --> 02:49:12.183]   The economy is generating approximately $30 trillion in wealth, and not all of it is What I consider legitimate wealth, it is in point of fact highly questionable in terms of nominative values.
[02:49:13.103 --> 02:49:24.533]  What we're doing in a number of areas, whether it be in the Federal Reserve, what we're watching our commercial banks do, they have basically a, they're on a government program to print money.
[02:49:25.694 --> 02:49:33.999]  And I use that in the colloquial expression to make profits despite whatever the situation is in the real economy.
[02:49:34.539 --> 02:49:46.447]  But when we talk about where we're headed in this country, most people right now, about 70% in nearly every poll I've seen, people are talking about living paycheck to paycheck.
[02:49:46.966 --> 02:49:57.312]  That should scare the hell out of everybody when you've got 70% of our adult population who are not making ends meet or doing so just barely.
[02:49:58.082 --> 02:50:12.307]  We have a serious problem and it's a serious problem that this Biden regime naturally is ignoring or in some cases supporting in terms of their policies.
[02:50:12.327 --> 02:50:13.188]  We're going to take that up.
[02:50:13.248 --> 02:50:14.488]  We're talking with Alex Jones.
[02:50:14.528 --> 02:50:17.429]  We're coming right back after these quick messages.
[02:50:17.569 --> 02:50:18.009]  Stay with us.
[02:50:19.670 --> 02:50:24.692]  We're back now with Alex Jones and Alex, we're talking about a banking system.
[02:50:25.490 --> 02:50:29.331]  That is, in some ways, highly concerning.
[02:50:30.232 --> 02:50:32.372]  And the regulators know it.
[02:50:33.133 --> 02:50:34.453]  The Federal Reserve knows it.
[02:50:35.233 --> 02:50:37.234]  I don't know what this administration knows.
[02:50:37.274 --> 02:50:44.556]  Their chief economic advisors to Biden are attorneys, so I don't know what they know and what they don't.
[02:50:44.636 --> 02:50:46.757]  They think they can negotiate their way out of anything.
[02:50:47.409 --> 02:50:52.996]  But the reality is that we are not, at this point, saving enough money.
[02:50:53.236 --> 02:51:04.550]  We don't have enough money in the system for people who are middle class, hardworking, and their families to get by, other than week to week on a paycheck.
[02:51:05.419 --> 02:51:13.041]  And there is in all of this great danger, because as you talked about civil war, what we're also talking about is a class war.
[02:51:13.881 --> 02:51:19.802]  And it's a class that is divided up again, sliced and diced by demographics.
[02:51:20.342 --> 02:51:28.884]  We're watching African-American prosecutors going after a white former president who was called a racist.
[02:51:29.600 --> 02:51:33.861]  But we can't find out where he was racist and which of his policies were.
[02:51:34.001 --> 02:51:51.664]  In point of fact, when you look at the prosperity that he brought to African Americans, to Hispanics in this country, the minorities, to working men and women and their families, for the first time during his presidency, real wages rose for middle class workers in this country.
[02:51:52.044 --> 02:51:55.565]  It had been 30 years, over 30 years, since that had been the case.
[02:51:56.627 --> 02:52:03.014]  And there is so much of a lie that is being foisted upon the American people.
[02:52:03.675 --> 02:52:10.483]  We are inundated with propaganda from our own government, campaigns of disinformation and misinformation.
[02:52:10.523 --> 02:52:15.929]  The principal source of most of it that bombards us is from our own federal government.
[02:52:16.797 --> 02:52:32.525]  And the rest of it is from the institutions that are now in disruption and chaos, and that is the colleges and universities, where they're indoctrinating our youth for the privilege of sending them $70,000.
[02:52:32.966 --> 02:52:38.929]  They'll indoctrinate our children into cultural Marxism.
[02:52:39.389 --> 02:52:45.312]  And by the way, we can catch up with education maybe five or six years later during your PhD program.
[02:52:45.832 --> 02:52:47.653]  I mean, it's bizarre.
[02:52:47.693 --> 02:52:49.255]  Well, you just nailed it.
[02:52:51.116 --> 02:52:55.339]  Cloward and Piven didn't invent overwhelming a government to collapse it, so you come in and take control.
[02:52:55.359 --> 02:52:56.460]  That was the French Revolution.
[02:52:56.820 --> 02:52:57.520]  That was Lenin.
[02:52:58.341 --> 02:53:05.026]  We've seen this before, but they admit we're overwhelming it with illegal aliens and all of this to collapse it.
[02:53:05.922 --> 02:53:10.625]  And if you extrapolate it out just politically, it's going to destroy the country worldwide.
[02:53:10.645 --> 02:53:11.646]  It's going to kill the dollar.
[02:53:12.006 --> 02:53:18.650]  But they have such a fixation in dominating the American people that they can't stop.
[02:53:18.730 --> 02:53:20.992]  So that's where we are.
[02:53:21.652 --> 02:53:28.131]   And you know, the good news is, As you said, massive record numbers of African-Americans going to vote for Trump.
[02:53:28.611 --> 02:53:29.712]  Record numbers of Hispanics.
[02:53:29.812 --> 02:53:31.533]  That's what panics the left even more.
[02:53:31.553 --> 02:53:35.895]  So they say, well, we bring in totally unwashed people that we totally control.
[02:53:35.975 --> 02:53:37.676]  Maybe they'll do what we want.
[02:53:37.697 --> 02:53:45.061]  Then we have famous videos of Democrats admitting, yeah, we're going to get a bigger apportionment in the census for more districts.
[02:53:45.161 --> 02:53:46.762]  And yeah, we're going to have them vote illegally.
[02:53:47.403 --> 02:53:54.143]   So really, it's a panic and a hysteria by the left because they know they've lost control.
[02:53:54.143 --> 02:53:55.842]  They know they've lost.
[02:53:55.842 --> 02:53:59.882]   And so what does somebody do who's a punk when they lost a chess game or checkers,
[02:53:59.882 --> 02:54:02.222]  they overturn the table or you're losing in poker.
[02:54:02.222 --> 02:54:04.742]  You say you cheated and overturned the table.
[02:54:04.742 --> 02:54:12.582]   But that said, that's what's so dangerous, Lou, is that we're at the moment of the communist,
[02:54:12.582 --> 02:54:19.122]   globalist, Marxist experiment that's failed everywhere else, failing on their main big targets.
[02:54:19.072 --> 02:54:23.794]  So they're going to throw a total hissy fit.
[02:54:23.974 --> 02:54:30.397]  I'll use the analogy of the great Blade Runner movie in the 1980s, where the Blade Runner goes in to kill the last few, you know, replicants.
[02:54:31.677 --> 02:54:35.459]  And he shoots Pris, the female replicant, and she throws this famous fit.
[02:54:35.499 --> 02:54:36.379]  Well, she's already been hit.
[02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:37.920]  They've already been hit.
[02:54:38.467 --> 02:54:41.712]  Politically, not violently, but we've already headshot their ass.
[02:54:41.972 --> 02:54:42.453]  They're done.
[02:54:42.473 --> 02:54:44.115]  Everybody's running against them.
[02:54:44.235 --> 02:54:46.057]  All over the world, populists are being elected.
[02:54:46.077 --> 02:54:48.040]  All over the world, nationalists are being elected.
[02:54:48.361 --> 02:54:55.130]  Whether it's Scotland, or whether it's El Salvador, whether it is New Zealand, or whether it's Italy.
[02:54:55.996 --> 02:54:58.378]  And the politicians aren't perfect, but they're moving in the right direction.
[02:54:58.658 --> 02:55:00.599]  Trudeau's got 20% approval ratings.
[02:55:00.819 --> 02:55:01.560]  The conservatives have 43.
[02:55:01.920 --> 02:55:04.061]  That hasn't happened in 10 years.
[02:55:04.201 --> 02:55:07.864]  I mean, we're running the tables, and that's why we're in so much danger.
[02:55:07.904 --> 02:55:11.246]  It's that paradox of who's going to have the victory.
[02:55:11.546 --> 02:55:15.989]  We're winning hearts and minds, but they get political control and have martial law and economic crisis.
[02:55:16.109 --> 02:55:23.374]  Or do we are smooth and controlled and easy and tell people what's about to happen so when they try it, nobody buys it?
[02:55:23.754 --> 02:55:26.996]   I see us This is a football game.
[02:55:27.016 --> 02:55:30.278]  We're in the third quarter and we're like seven points ahead.
[02:55:30.698 --> 02:55:35.159]  It's our game to lose and that means everybody watching has got to share this.
[02:55:35.799 --> 02:55:39.821]  Everybody watching has got to send this out in other shows.
[02:55:39.921 --> 02:55:42.322]  Everybody watching has got to go talk to their congressmen and women.
[02:55:43.282 --> 02:55:44.563]  Because people think I'm just a little person.
[02:55:44.603 --> 02:55:44.963]  No, you're not.
[02:55:45.443 --> 02:55:51.165]  Every little action now of courage to warn people has more effects.
[02:55:51.185 --> 02:55:52.425]  You know, the communists talk about this.
[02:55:52.846 --> 02:56:03.630]   The social engineers talk about I mean, I guess it's actually, is it a Stalin or a Lenin quote, that there are times in history where more happens in a month than happened in a hundred years.
[02:56:04.270 --> 02:56:09.651]  We are now in that point that the social engineers call a liquification.
[02:56:10.111 --> 02:56:17.594]  Normally society's rigid, their status quo, but every hundred years or so, you know, the whole third, fourth turning, all of that, there's a time when it's liquefied.
[02:56:18.074 --> 02:56:21.435]  Well, things are soft right now, they're malleable like clay.
[02:56:22.128 --> 02:56:25.132]  And so we don't just sit back while they create their new nightmare.
[02:56:25.513 --> 02:56:26.274]  We oppose it.
[02:56:26.654 --> 02:56:27.876]  We build alternate systems.
[02:56:27.916 --> 02:56:28.737]  We expose them.
[02:56:29.138 --> 02:56:33.924]  And so we have the greatest opportunities right now, but also the greatest downsides.
[02:56:34.265 --> 02:56:37.809]  Because the Chinese say in their proverb, may you live in interesting times.
[02:56:37.870 --> 02:56:38.731]  It's a double-edged sword.
[02:56:39.131 --> 02:56:44.413]  The opportunities are insane, but with opportunity, in a flux point comes incredible danger.
[02:56:44.433 --> 02:56:53.737]  So I cannot stress, in 30 years I've been on air, even on air a lot longer, we are at the maximum danger point of total urgency.
[02:56:54.017 --> 02:56:56.478]  And I would just say to listeners, this is real.
[02:56:56.498 --> 02:56:59.159]  And I know listeners know this, and viewers know this, but listen to me carefully.
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:01.060]  God is in control.
[02:57:02.230 --> 02:57:07.894]  And I think the most important thing of the trials and tribulations I've gone through, it's come out in Congress, it's come out in undercover videos.
[02:57:08.275 --> 02:57:12.918]  I was talking about the FBI, the CIA with false narratives and incredible lawfare.
[02:57:13.339 --> 02:57:15.660]  Nothing compared to Trump, but like, I'm second to Trump.
[02:57:16.041 --> 02:57:17.882]  And he's a hundred times worse.
[02:57:17.942 --> 02:57:20.284]  I can't even imagine the iron will of that guy.
[02:57:21.104 --> 02:57:24.687]  But I'm telling you, they did it because they fear what we were saying.
[02:57:25.748 --> 02:57:56.171]   And so we are at this inflection point Right now, because they fear the people, and I just want listeners to know, praying to God, and not telling God what to do, but just saying, God, lead God and direct me, I pray for freedom, I pray for awakening, I pray for peace, I pray for justice, I pray for love, and not buying into the... In closing, it was in WikiLeaks, in 2016, I think it was Columbia, but the point is, Hillary is talking in an email chain, which they admit is real,
[02:57:56.866 --> 02:57:59.288]  To the head psychologist of the psychology department.
[02:57:59.808 --> 02:58:02.590]  And they say, listen, no one's listening to us, no one cares.
[02:58:03.290 --> 02:58:06.873]  The last thing we've got is culture war, and then all that comes with that.
[02:58:06.913 --> 02:58:14.758]  Well, we now see that, and the nasty deprivation and evil looks horrible.
[02:58:14.798 --> 02:58:16.159]  It makes us feel bad about America.
[02:58:16.219 --> 02:58:21.123]  No, that's a ruling, dying class, and it's their last gasp.
[02:58:21.863 --> 02:58:26.066]  And so we have to see that, as negative as it is, as a positive desperation.
[02:58:27.446 --> 02:58:31.330]  Well, I applaud everything you just said.
[02:58:31.350 --> 02:58:43.730]   I do think it's important also for everyone listening to us to understand And by the way, prayer is powerful and God is almighty.
[02:58:44.730 --> 02:58:52.252]  And you won't get much better support or direction than from God.
[02:58:53.032 --> 02:58:59.333]  But the other part is, it's on us to understand just how severe the battle is that awaits us.
[02:58:59.973 --> 02:59:04.894]  As difficult as things are now, I truly believe we're going to see much worse.
[02:59:05.738 --> 02:59:18.405]  And I don't believe anybody can predict all of it, but the reality is we're a nation that has squandered wealth that was built up over generations of Americans.
[02:59:18.585 --> 02:59:20.366]  We pretend for some reason.
[02:59:20.962 --> 02:59:27.665]  That we can just keep going at the same rate and waste away our resources.
[02:59:27.805 --> 02:59:28.446]  We cannot.
[02:59:28.886 --> 02:59:32.708]  We're crazy enough to send $61 billion to Ukraine.
[02:59:33.148 --> 02:59:44.994]  Well, we're borrowing $61 billion from China so we can send that money to Ukraine so that Russia, backed by China, can fight and go to what end?
[02:59:46.586 --> 02:59:57.991]  The level of contradiction within our foreign policy, the level of contradiction in our foreign policy, we had a great disrupter elected president back in 2016.
[02:59:59.562 --> 03:00:06.588]  We need that same disruptor here, because just as you suggested, I truly believe he is the Churchill of our times.
[03:00:07.429 --> 03:00:12.113]  He is, and this is 1939, and the war has begun.
[03:00:12.573 --> 03:00:21.481]  And the Republican Party would have no brand at all, no ideology at all, no philosophy, if it were not for Donald Trump.
[03:00:21.861 --> 03:00:23.162]  And it has the...
[03:00:24.564 --> 03:00:33.105]  The wonderful, wonderful advantage of being put together with six words.
[03:00:33.817 --> 03:00:36.258]  America first, make America great again.
[03:00:36.758 --> 03:00:40.700]  And we really have to get into the fight, all of us, in every way possible.
[03:00:41.360 --> 03:00:43.141]  And will it be a civil war?
[03:00:43.401 --> 03:00:43.962]  I don't know.
[03:00:44.062 --> 03:00:46.043]  I know that the left wants a civil war.
[03:00:46.083 --> 03:01:02.570]  This is provocation, whether it is going after Donald Trump or whether it is trying to intimidate the Supreme Court into doing exactly what a cognitively impaired, corrupt puppet president says do.
[03:01:03.437 --> 03:01:05.356]  And Lou, I totally agree with you in closing.
[03:01:06.405 --> 03:01:07.525]  This isn't a civil war.
[03:01:07.565 --> 03:01:09.326]  It's a communist leftist uprising.
[03:01:09.786 --> 03:01:16.648]  When they attack and one cop does one thing wrong, that'll be the whole new pretext they admit.
[03:01:16.748 --> 03:01:19.529]  I mean, they are planning to get us in a fight.
[03:01:19.609 --> 03:01:20.429]  I say we don't do it.
[03:01:20.469 --> 03:01:21.610]  We're winning intellectually.
[03:01:21.970 --> 03:01:23.070]  We're winning with God.
[03:01:23.710 --> 03:01:25.371]  And we've just got to stop cloward and pivot.
[03:01:25.951 --> 03:01:27.092]  We have a good shot at winning.
[03:01:27.132 --> 03:01:28.252]  That's what's so frustrating, though.
[03:01:28.612 --> 03:01:30.893]  If I knew we were going to lose, I would just say, well, it's God's will.
[03:01:30.913 --> 03:01:31.633]  We're being judged.
[03:01:31.973 --> 03:01:38.487]   God's giving America, you know, von Bismarck said, God loves children, drunks, United States of America.
[03:01:38.968 --> 03:01:40.308]  I mean, we've been given nine lives.
[03:01:41.129 --> 03:01:43.310]  And I've got children, you've got children, grandchildren.
[03:01:43.550 --> 03:01:45.030]  I've got children about to have grandchildren.
[03:01:45.191 --> 03:01:46.111]  I love this country.
[03:01:46.511 --> 03:01:47.952]  It's the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[03:01:47.992 --> 03:01:48.872]  Let's save it together.
[03:01:49.713 --> 03:01:50.373]  Amen, brother.
[03:01:50.873 --> 03:01:52.054]  Thanks for being with us, Alex.
[03:01:52.454 --> 03:01:52.894]  God bless.
[03:01:53.434 --> 03:01:53.955]  Thank you, Lou.
[03:01:54.495 --> 03:01:54.815]  Thank you.
[03:01:56.301 --> 03:02:02.386]  Seven days ago, the desperate Deep State tried to assassinate our President, Donald Trump.
[03:02:03.127 --> 03:02:07.030]  And since then, we've learned that it was a Deep State Secret Service stand-down.
[03:02:07.631 --> 03:02:10.333]  And since then, we've seen the Democrats deny the shooting even happened.
[03:02:11.133 --> 03:02:16.037]  While they still say they want him dead, like Anna Navarro said, and she wished he was shot right in the mouth.
[03:02:16.926 --> 03:02:20.407]  We need to pray for President Trump tonight in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[03:02:21.088 --> 03:02:22.708]  He is a warrior on the field.
[03:02:23.168 --> 03:02:26.910]  We are taking America back from the globalists right now.
[03:02:27.510 --> 03:02:28.951]  He just talked to Zelensky today.
[03:02:29.471 --> 03:02:31.211]  Zelensky knows he's a puppet of the globalists.
[03:02:31.572 --> 03:02:32.592]  He wants to end the war.
[03:02:32.972 --> 03:02:34.593]  He says he's ready to end the war.
[03:02:35.293 --> 03:02:39.517]  We could do this in just a few months if we get President Trump in.
[03:02:39.997 --> 03:02:42.700]  But the CIA and the globalists don't want that.
[03:02:42.860 --> 03:02:44.121]  The same reason they killed Kennedy in 63.
[03:02:44.581 --> 03:02:46.583]  He was trying to pull the troops out of Vietnam.
[03:02:46.623 --> 03:02:47.124]  He'd ordered it.
[03:02:47.744 --> 03:02:49.546]  They're about to try it again.
[03:02:49.646 --> 03:02:54.991]  So pray for President Trump, who's on the front lines, and stand with him right now.
[03:02:55.531 --> 03:02:56.873]  And don't take this election for granted.
[03:02:57.153 --> 03:03:03.345]   Sure, he's 20 points ahead in polls, but they've got a lot of fraud baked in, but they can't Rig a landslide.
[03:03:03.385 --> 03:03:05.515]  As Trump said, we've got to swamp them.
[03:03:05.555 --> 03:03:06.058]  So tonight...
[03:03:06.900 --> 03:03:07.440]  In Michigan.
[03:03:08.100 --> 03:03:09.381]  Pray for Trump's protection.
[03:03:09.441 --> 03:03:16.283]  Pray for those protecting him and pray for the great awakening that's already happening to radically expand because history is happening now.
[03:03:16.583 --> 03:03:17.923]  There's not just evil in the universe.
[03:03:18.444 --> 03:03:19.284]  There's good as well.
[03:03:19.724 --> 03:03:27.006]  But as Thomas Jefferson said, all that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[03:03:27.306 --> 03:03:28.707]  Well, we're not doing nothing.
[03:03:29.047 --> 03:03:30.007]  We're standing strong.
[03:03:30.027 --> 03:03:32.908]  And I'm so proud to be involved with all of you online.
[03:03:33.368 --> 03:03:38.013]  And right here in the third dimension, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, male, female doing this.
[03:03:38.033 --> 03:03:39.135]  This is so exciting.
[03:03:39.595 --> 03:03:40.656]  So God bless you all.
[03:03:40.876 --> 03:03:42.338]  But the power of prayer is real.
[03:03:42.859 --> 03:03:44.480]  Trump turned his head right at the right moment.
[03:03:44.601 --> 03:03:45.281]  Missed that bullet.
[03:03:45.602 --> 03:03:45.902]  Dropped.
[03:03:45.942 --> 03:03:47.043]  The other bullet hit the lectern.
[03:03:47.404 --> 03:03:48.525]  He was almost killed.
[03:03:48.545 --> 03:03:49.646]  Now we know there were multiple shooters.
[03:03:50.026 --> 03:03:52.109]  It's all coming out and the Globos are desperate.
[03:03:52.489 --> 03:03:57.231]  This is a make it or break it moment, so I need people to connect those synapses in their brain for you to make a decision.
[03:03:57.391 --> 03:03:59.732]  If you don't support InfoWars, we will be shut down.
[03:03:59.752 --> 03:04:02.273]  People say, well, they're constantly trying to shut you down.
[03:04:02.313 --> 03:04:03.874]  How are you still on the air?
[03:04:03.793 --> 03:04:25.113]  real Alex Jones.
[03:04:25.051 --> 03:04:30.376]  So we're in a paradox here where the judge says we're open for three more months.
[03:04:32.057 --> 03:04:36.521]  If we're able to get a buyer under the law, they won't be able to shut us down.
[03:04:36.561 --> 03:04:37.462]  I'll just work with somebody else.
[03:04:38.382 --> 03:04:38.883]  And that's coming.
[03:04:38.903 --> 03:04:39.603]  That's got to be set up.
[03:04:40.784 --> 03:04:49.972]  But in the meantime, if people believe the news that we're being shut down everywhere, which they tried to do and failed, by that foregone conclusion, we're shut down.
[03:04:50.112 --> 03:04:59.917]   And under The last federal bankruptcy manager who would not reorder product and killed all our advertising, he was positioning us to be shut down and tried to shut us down.
[03:05:00.978 --> 03:05:01.438]  We caught him.
[03:05:01.679 --> 03:05:02.740]  The judge caught him and fired him.
[03:05:04.221 --> 03:05:05.662]  We're almost sold out of all the products.
[03:05:06.499 --> 03:05:06.739]  All right?
[03:05:07.560 --> 03:05:10.302]  But we have a lot of great products that are still in stock.
[03:05:10.782 --> 03:05:11.543]  Limited supply.
[03:05:11.583 --> 03:05:14.845]  So I need you to go to InfoWarshaw.com.
[03:05:15.065 --> 03:05:16.126]  And we just had a donation button.
[03:05:16.146 --> 03:05:16.907]  Maybe we should just do that.
[03:05:17.647 --> 03:05:20.409]  You're fighting for freedom in a key election, battling the globalists.
[03:05:20.429 --> 03:05:21.090]  We need support.
[03:05:21.811 --> 03:05:23.392]  But we want a long-term relationship with you.
[03:05:23.412 --> 03:05:25.353]  We want you to be symbiotic.

[03:05:32.899 --> 03:05:33.840]  We want a relationship.
[03:05:34.767 --> 03:05:40.531]  So, there's the InfoWars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[03:05:41.271 --> 03:05:48.536]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's saw palmetto, or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[03:05:48.556 --> 03:05:52.979]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[03:05:53.059 --> 03:05:54.300]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[03:05:55.020 --> 03:06:05.688]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWars MD.
