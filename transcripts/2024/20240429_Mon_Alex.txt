[00:00:12.628 --> 00:00:15.588]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:15.588 --> 00:00:31.528]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:32.171]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:32.272 --> 00:00:39.272]  today.
[00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:50.272]  This is it, boys.
[00:00:50.272 --> 00:00:51.272]  189.
[00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.850]  189 days, 12 hours, 59 minutes, 31 seconds.
[00:00:55.751 --> 00:00:58.012]  The most important election in world history.
[00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:09.536]  And we are still here at the embattled and dauntless InfoWars News Studios in Central Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:01:10.497 --> 00:01:11.657]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:12.358 --> 00:01:17.440]  We'll be here live for the next four hours ahead of Owen Schroeder with The War Room at 3 p.m.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.960]  Central.
[00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:19.712]  All right.
[00:01:20.832 --> 00:01:22.093]  We have several huge guests.
[00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:32.115]  We have one of the journalists who's had to be exiled here to the United States from Brazil, dealing with the fact that it's all come out now in mainstream news.
[00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:42.977]  What I told you years ago, the State Department has been quarterbacking the overthrow of the populist movements and the arrest of their leaders and their persecution and taking them off the ballots.
[00:01:44.217 --> 00:01:53.827]   In Brazil, Elon Musk is set to testify Coming up on May 6 to Congress.
[00:01:56.768 --> 00:02:05.812]  Dealing with the fact that foreign governments are coming in now, arresting ex-employees and pledging to criminally indict Musk.
[00:02:06.713 --> 00:02:08.533]  And the EU doing similar things as well.
[00:02:08.613 --> 00:02:09.634]  This is global governance.
[00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.073]  And it's being run out of the White House, out of the State Department.
[00:02:15.853 --> 00:02:35.669]  That's coming up in the second hour with Alice Dos Santos, Alan Dos Santos, and then we're also going to have Peter Schiff on the incredible developments in the monetization of debt, what's happening with gold, what's happening with U.S.
[00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.371]  Treasury bills, such an important interview.
[00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:46.151]  With Peter Schiff coming up in the third hour today, and then the great Gerald Cilente will be joining us.
[00:02:47.132 --> 00:02:50.214]  Trends Forecaster in the fourth hour.
[00:02:51.435 --> 00:02:51.775]  All right.
[00:02:54.157 --> 00:02:58.380]  Really, the big story, and it is getting a lot of attention.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.622]  I don't always just cover something because it's getting a lot of attention.
[00:03:01.582 --> 00:03:04.865]  I don't think it's really a central story, but it is incredibly important.
[00:03:06.172 --> 00:03:15.876]  And that is the huge awakening to replacement migration and the UN globalist plan to end all Western nations as we know it and create vulcanized populations.
[00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:25.260]  And at the center of that is the open Hollywood corporate New World Order idea that white people are inherently evil and bad.
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:34.904]  And this is really breaking in Europe, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, where this is being carried out and everywhere.
[00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:45.040]  WEF-financed, controlled politicians are being removed, basically on a weekly basis.
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.660]  So they're falling like dominoes.
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:04:07.836]   The first minister, as their president or prime minister is called, in Scotland, whose parents are from Central Asia, He famously got up last year and said, there's too many white people in Scotland, and white people are inherently bad.
[00:04:08.597 --> 00:04:13.158]  Well, he's stepped down because his government has fallen apart beneath him.
[00:04:14.178 --> 00:04:30.680]   And that dovetails with the mayor, who was not elected, she was installed, of Derry in Ireland, saying if people don't like a massive illegal alien government funded invasion, Of Ireland, they are terrorists and should be arrested.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.381]  And the police are going to people's houses that online criticize the open borders and all the crime and murder.
[00:04:37.022 --> 00:04:37.862]  And they're beating them up.
[00:04:38.062 --> 00:04:40.903]  Well that's going to backfire big time.
[00:04:40.963 --> 00:04:43.864]  The English could never conquer Ireland completely.
[00:04:44.704 --> 00:04:51.186]  And the third world weaponized hordes aren't going to be able to do it either.
[00:04:51.386 --> 00:04:54.247]  So they've bitten off more than they can chew with the old Irish.
[00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:57.283]  So we're going to come back and break it all down.
[00:04:57.323 --> 00:05:00.525]  There's so much today, so many other huge topics and issues.
[00:05:01.226 --> 00:05:04.629]  The globalists are officially trying to trigger a civil war.
[00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.473]  For the minute Trump gets reelected, we'll cover it all straight ahead.
[00:05:10.173 --> 00:05:13.396]  It's Monday, April 29th, 2024.
[00:05:14.877 --> 00:05:16.499]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:18.981 --> 00:05:27.442]   As we ride along on this beautiful planet through deep space, As the chemtrails are sprayed over the country club.
[00:05:32.203 --> 00:05:40.105]  The perfect analogy by Lana Del Reyn of pretending like we're not under attack.
[00:05:40.285 --> 00:05:42.646]  All of us, old, young, black, white.
[00:05:44.086 --> 00:05:46.467]  We're all being targeted by the poison shots, the GMO, the 5G.
[00:05:48.206 --> 00:06:06.042]  The only way the globalists can win their dehumanization depopulation plan is if we're so busy at each other's throats via the great game of vulcanization or divide and conquer that we can never unite enough to stop their horrific agenda.
[00:06:07.303 --> 00:06:10.526]  And boy do we have a lot of big examples of that today.
[00:06:11.947 --> 00:06:25.101]   Wherever you live in the world, The globalists are pushing poison mRNA shots on you, not just for COVID, but now for the flu or cancer, everything else, even though the shots trigger massive health problems and death.
[00:06:27.142 --> 00:06:44.271]  And whether you're in the EU, or whether you are in Ukraine, or whether you are in Brazil, the same CIA think tank Soros Combine is trying to block populist movements from gaining control via legal voting.
[00:06:45.796 --> 00:06:57.422]  With the same tactics they're using here in the United States of prosecuting and persecuting populist leaders, imprisoning them, and trying and in many cases successfully putting them in prison.
[00:06:59.983 --> 00:07:05.686]  Because everywhere, globalists are being removed from office or on the verge of being removed from office.
[00:07:07.032 --> 00:07:22.756]  In Australia, in Canada, in New Zealand, in Italy, in the Netherlands, in the UK, in the United States, in El Salvador, in so many other places, like Argentina.
[00:07:24.757 --> 00:07:26.798]  They are losing their hearts and minds.
[00:07:26.838 --> 00:07:35.100]  There is a global political awakening and realignment to that, and the Democrats are in full panic mode here.
[00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:52.113]  And their other sister parties, the Tories, and the Liberals, and the Communists, and the Socialist parties around the world are going into desperation mode in an attempt to stamp out the resistance.
[00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:54.134]  New World Order puppet out!
[00:07:54.235 --> 00:07:59.799]  Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf resigns.
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.943]  He's the guy that said there's too many white people in Scotland.
[00:08:05.993 --> 00:08:11.475]  It's not racist or hateful if you're white and people are saying you're inherently bad because you're white.
[00:08:12.035 --> 00:08:12.895]  You should have this guilt.
[00:08:12.915 --> 00:08:16.696]  You should do whatever the politicians and big banks like BlackRock say.
[00:08:20.497 --> 00:08:22.338]  In fact, it's self-preservation.
[00:08:23.598 --> 00:08:28.380]  But this racial divide being set up is being orchestrated by the power elite against everybody.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.600]  And everyone's being targeted.
[00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:51.376]   And so when you're white, And you bow down to Black Lives Matter, Soros Operation, or you sign on all this political correctness so that you believe the angel of political correctness, the angel of death, will pass over you, like lamb's blood on your doorway, it actually brings the wolves to attack you and get you deeper into the system.
[00:08:54.116 --> 00:09:14.080]  No, when you're told you're inherently evil, when you're told you're bad, when you're told you shouldn't exist, when you're told, in the few countries where whites are the majority, 93% of the world's not white, when you're told you should roll over and die because you're inherently bad, and you've made no contributions to civilization, which is the opposite, it is not just your right, it is your duty to say that's wrong.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:34.525]   Oh, Arabia for the Arabs, Asia for the Asians, Africa for the Africans, Latin America with Latin Americans, but not Europe, not Ireland, not Scotland, not England, not Germany, not France, not Sweden, not Finland, not Denmark, not Spain.
[00:09:34.545 --> 00:09:40.028]  You're told you don't have a homeland.
[00:09:41.309 --> 00:09:48.213]  And Europe and America have been the most open to people from all over the world.
[00:09:49.154 --> 00:09:56.540]   But Europe itself is where Caucasoids, white people, come from.
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.501]  And it's where the globalists are based.
[00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:02.962]  They've already enslaved the third world.
[00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:08.203]  Now they're using the colonized countries they control to come in and reverse colonize Europe.
[00:10:08.763 --> 00:10:11.344]  And that's replacement migration, the official UN plan.
[00:10:11.804 --> 00:10:13.364]  Go to the UN website, type in replacement migration.
[00:10:13.624 --> 00:10:15.405]  You'll get all these documents going back 25 years.
[00:10:16.785 --> 00:10:18.786]  And the Kalergi Plan going back 100 years.
[00:10:18.846 --> 00:10:19.626]  It's all there.
[00:10:22.261 --> 00:10:24.482]  You can write down the names, I say, if you're a new listener.
[00:10:26.443 --> 00:10:37.189]  And we saw during George Floyd, all over the country, millions of white people marching in the streets, and in this video, tens of thousands, worshipping and praying to black people.
[00:10:37.989 --> 00:10:42.811]  What they're really worshipping and praying to is a George Soros agenda that stuck a black face on it.
[00:10:43.372 --> 00:10:51.736]  That's why you turn on any corporate spokesperson, or any movie, and 99% of the corporate spokespersons are black.
[00:10:53.066 --> 00:11:00.089]  And in every corporate movie, it's a directive, it's admitted, white men are the bad guys and black women save the day.
[00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.211]  That's not to empower black people, folks.
[00:11:03.751 --> 00:11:07.132]  That is to piss white people off and create a cultural divide.
[00:11:08.733 --> 00:11:09.433]  Which it's doing.
[00:11:10.614 --> 00:11:24.210]   And I don't want white people to go to the radical extreme of the Soros dialectic agiprop operation and Feed in to this racial civil war.
[00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.051]  You've got to stand up for yourself.
[00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:27.532]  You've got to expose the propaganda.
[00:11:28.392 --> 00:11:31.414]  You've got to deport the military age men that have been shipped in and the criminals.
[00:11:31.994 --> 00:11:34.755]  But you've also got to understand the divide and conquer strategy.
[00:11:34.775 --> 00:11:37.837]  And there's a good article from Zero Hedge explaining it.
[00:11:38.217 --> 00:11:41.778]  How Soros' latest Agiprop exposed the hypocrisy of the right.
[00:11:41.798 --> 00:11:44.660]  And I'll get to some of that later.
[00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.440]  Oh, we're against censorship, unless it's of the commies.
[00:11:49.221 --> 00:11:54.064]  Oh, we're against police brutality, unless you're attacking the communist protesters.
[00:11:55.124 --> 00:11:57.185]  And the Hezbollah protesters, the Hamas protesters.
[00:11:59.326 --> 00:12:02.348]  Again, and when they get attacked, it makes them stronger.
[00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:12.914]  That's why Biden gave six billion a month before Hezbollah-controlled Hamas attacked Israel.
[00:12:14.451 --> 00:12:21.534]  That's why when Benjamin Netanyahu comes out and says we need to arrest and shut down these demonstrations, he says it in general.
[00:12:21.754 --> 00:12:24.835]  He doesn't say arrest the people blocking Jews from going in colleges.
[00:12:25.195 --> 00:12:31.357]  He doesn't say stop the school administrators that told all the white people they can't come in for a week over the rest of the semester.
[00:12:34.439 --> 00:12:40.641]  No, no, he doesn't call out George Soros and say George Soros on record is the main funder with State Department money.
[00:12:42.188 --> 00:12:50.034]  It is bailing these people out by the tens of thousands when they actually burn things down or attack people and build their little autonomous zones.
[00:12:51.395 --> 00:12:53.356]  No, no, he just says get rid of the First Amendment.
[00:12:53.537 --> 00:12:54.157]  See how it works?
[00:12:54.737 --> 00:13:03.024]  And I'm telling you behind the scenes there's a wink-wink deal with Iran and Israel and the EU and the U.S.
[00:13:04.144 --> 00:13:16.193]  To stir all this up and have some terror attacks so they can then set up more of a police state like the TSA to stick its hands down your pants, but this time checkpoints at bus stations and highways, which they're announcing they're going to roll out.
[00:13:16.213 --> 00:13:18.856]  It's already started in Chicago and New York, as I told you it would.
[00:13:20.177 --> 00:13:21.718]  But the border will still be wide open.
[00:13:22.959 --> 00:13:29.244]  And nobody's going to get kicked out of Harvard or Princeton or Columbia.
[00:13:31.564 --> 00:13:45.795]  When they get up on the stage and say, yay for October 7th, and kill all the Jews, and kill anyone that doesn't want Israel wiped off the face of the earth, and from the rivers to the sea, from the mountains to the sea, kill all the Jews.
[00:13:45.855 --> 00:13:49.157]  I mean, I've probably seen a hundred clips of that the last few days.
[00:13:49.798 --> 00:13:54.962]  And those aren't just people in the crowd saying it, it's bonafide communists.
[00:13:56.274 --> 00:13:59.215]  Big, fat, lesbian, you know, women.
[00:14:00.075 --> 00:14:03.135]  And I'm not even attacking lesbians, I'm just saying it's always a big, fat lesbian.
[00:14:05.496 --> 00:14:20.219]  Up there, in the latest video, as they pull down American flags and as they attack the police, and the police, when a crowd's peaceful, attack them.
[00:14:20.239 --> 00:14:22.399]  You see the videos of police intimidated.
[00:14:23.186 --> 00:14:24.506]  When they actually attack, they back off.
[00:14:24.526 --> 00:14:26.867]  When they're not being attacked, like at your team, they attack.
[00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:29.568]  Last week, it's just pathetic.
[00:14:30.289 --> 00:14:32.349]  And this is how you shake up the beehive.
[00:14:32.409 --> 00:14:33.890]  This is how you get the crisis going.
[00:14:36.351 --> 00:14:42.553]  And, you know, a fat, bald-headed lesbian, if she actually tried to live in the Middle East, she'd be thrown off a roof.
[00:14:42.873 --> 00:14:43.833]  She'd be stoned to death.
[00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:45.054]  She'd be strangled.
[00:14:45.314 --> 00:14:46.814]  She'd be shot within days.
[00:14:49.415 --> 00:14:51.336]  And they're totally incompatible with Islam.
[00:14:52.768 --> 00:15:05.439]  But you see these bizarre images and videos of drag queen story time where women in burkas bring their children, and most Muslims aren't like this, but it's happened, to the drag queen pedo time.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.022]  I posted on X last week an image and a link to some of the video of that.
[00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:14.086]  I mean, you can't make up the odd bedfellows here, how oxymoronic it is.
[00:15:14.106 --> 00:15:18.690]  So I've got a lot of clips today ahead of special guests we're going to be having on.
[00:15:21.596 --> 00:15:24.657]  But there's a lot of these clips, so let's just start plowing through them.
[00:15:25.497 --> 00:15:28.457]  Here's what I posted on Expo an hour ago.
[00:15:28.457 --> 00:15:34.377]   I see a disgusting communist slob that couldn't find its ass with both hands praising a premeditated
[00:15:34.377 --> 00:15:36.457]  terror attack on men, women, and children.
[00:15:36.457 --> 00:15:39.077]  This is all deep state, Joe Biden, George Soros funded.
[00:15:39.077 --> 00:15:41.617]  It's designed to create a climate of civil war in the West.
[00:15:41.617 --> 00:15:45.376]   I've said over and over again, Israel needs to target leadership of Hamas, not women and
[00:15:45.376 --> 00:15:46.376]  children.
[00:15:46.376 --> 00:15:50.577]   Israel's indiscriminate bombing of Gaza only emboldens radical Islamists and their communist
[00:15:50.577 --> 00:15:51.577]  sympathizers.
[00:15:51.577 --> 00:15:57.097]   And I would add that it had been shipped into the West by the tens of millions.
[00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.411]  So they're setting up this confrontation.
[00:16:00.892 --> 00:16:04.894]  And so I don't support Hamas, funded by Hezbollah, funded by Biden attacking Israel.
[00:16:05.394 --> 00:16:12.158]  I don't support Israel systematically destroying all of Gaza and killing a majority of the people being killed, women and children.
[00:16:13.882 --> 00:16:24.589]  But then Soros and the left and the media is hyping it up and the colleges are hyping it up to get this furor and fervor going and turn up the temperature ahead of Trump winning the election in 189 days.
[00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:37.236]  And then we will plunge into another 79 days of hell between the date in November and the inauguration in January 21st, 2025.
[00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:47.176]   21st, 2025. And I predicted it all in the months before the election in 2020. And I'm telling you
[00:16:47.176 --> 00:16:52.935]   now there's movies and TV shows and Obama produced a TV show for Netflix and shows like Civil War,
[00:16:52.935 --> 00:17:01.975]   big blockbuster $350 million productions and professors and MSNBC and CNN and ABC News,
[00:17:01.975 --> 00:17:05.815]   The Washington Post, The New York Times, Civil War is coming.
[00:17:05.402 --> 00:17:18.544]   And they bill it as, like we're South Africa, Right-wing white rule versus an uprising of the Islamists and the communists and the left and everybody against the evil of America!
[00:17:18.564 --> 00:17:29.510]  And you see the film Civil War, a terrorist, the first five minutes runs in with an American flag and blows up a group of illegal aliens.
[00:17:32.011 --> 00:17:38.395]  And then white people kill anybody that's not American or white.
[00:17:40.205 --> 00:17:50.953]  And then people sit there and they ask, oh what's this movie about?
[00:17:51.454 --> 00:17:53.055]  You don't know who the good guys and bad guys are.
[00:17:53.075 --> 00:17:54.816]  That's how dumb the public is.
[00:17:55.237 --> 00:17:55.917]  How dumbed down.
[00:17:57.178 --> 00:18:01.502]  That it isn't spelled out in blazing fire ringed letters.
[00:18:03.953 --> 00:18:04.594]  What's this about?
[00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:09.077]  It's about a Trump character being overthrown, the American flag falling, D.C.
[00:18:09.117 --> 00:18:15.101]  blown up, the monuments blown up, and a new America that rises, and a black woman that kills the president.
[00:18:16.563 --> 00:18:22.667]  And it's a celebration with his dead body, it's a snuff film, and Che Guevara types lining up U.S.
[00:18:22.747 --> 00:18:24.348]  Army soldiers and executing them.
[00:18:24.989 --> 00:18:29.993]  It's a communist dream, a fever dream, a snuff film.
[00:18:32.068 --> 00:18:33.489]  I knew within 20 seconds.
[00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:34.691]  And I didn't read the spoilers.
[00:18:34.731 --> 00:18:36.172]  I didn't do an analysis of it before.
[00:18:36.212 --> 00:18:37.033]  I guessed what it was.
[00:18:37.053 --> 00:18:39.996]  I told my wife 30 seconds in, I said, this is gonna be about killing Trump in the White House.
[00:18:40.899 --> 00:18:41.960]  She goes, what, have you seen it?
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:42.900]  And I said, no, watch.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.401]  At the end she goes, how the hell did you predict it?
[00:18:45.421 --> 00:18:49.543]  I don't usually talk during movies, and I was like, telling her what's going to happen next.
[00:18:50.144 --> 00:18:57.908]  Because I instantly saw it, and then Che Guevara types, literal Che Guevara's lining up the white men and machine gunning them as their bodies flop around.
[00:18:57.928 --> 00:18:59.128]  They keep pumping bullets at them.
[00:18:59.668 --> 00:19:06.672]  It's orgasmic as they, die whites, die whites, die, die, die whites, die, die, die.
[00:19:10.478 --> 00:19:13.540]  There's only one black person on the enemy team.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.461]  She's the press secretary and she supports Trump.
[00:19:15.481 --> 00:19:17.582]  So she's a woman, unarmed, executed.
[00:19:18.442 --> 00:19:22.644]  Everybody starts laughing and enjoying it and they pose with the dead body of the president.
[00:19:23.725 --> 00:19:25.326]  There's all white secret service.
[00:19:26.606 --> 00:19:27.747]  They're all old white men.
[00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:29.268]  They just have white men.
[00:19:29.308 --> 00:19:33.730]  It's old white men in machine gun battles with the new army.
[00:19:34.943 --> 00:19:37.524]  The American flag's machine gun and blows up and falls.
[00:19:37.785 --> 00:19:40.646]  American flags are falling, falling, falling, falling.
[00:19:42.326 --> 00:19:45.205]  And the good guys are taking it down.
[00:19:45.205 --> 00:19:56.006]  So they're telling you what they're planning.
[00:19:56.155 --> 00:19:57.976]  And they've got all these LA Times headlines.
[00:19:57.996 --> 00:20:06.978]   This last week, top professors Multiple universities predict the big civil wars here.
[00:20:07.018 --> 00:20:07.918]  It's not a civil war.
[00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:28.651]  It's a elite CIA, Carnegie Endowment, WEF, color revolution against the Republic to permanently racially divide us and create absolute hell for the Great Reset to build on our ashes a new race-based tyranny in the name of fighting race-based systems.
[00:20:31.343 --> 00:20:33.525]  And then they can toggle it back and forth in the future.
[00:20:33.545 --> 00:20:38.830]  It won't be about freedom or justice or low taxes or a good currency.
[00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:41.713]  It'll all be about the different racial alliances.
[00:20:41.733 --> 00:20:48.419]  They've even tried, as you know, the last three or four years to say there's record white on Asian crime.
[00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:52.003]  That's actually the second rarest crime in America.
[00:20:52.023 --> 00:20:54.365]  A violent crime is white on Asian.
[00:20:57.386 --> 00:21:01.648]  The only other rare crime is Asian on white.
[00:21:03.088 --> 00:21:04.949]  Asians have the lowest crime rate on average.
[00:21:04.969 --> 00:21:07.911]  This is a fact.
[00:21:08.271 --> 00:21:15.634]  But in the movie, if you watch carefully, white people go around hunting down Asians to execute them.
[00:21:17.295 --> 00:21:36.427]   And I was sitting there next to a bunch of Chinese American teenagers When I watched the movie, and they were gasping and very upset by the white devils, that in a simulation that doesn't exist, are you Chinese?
[00:21:36.927 --> 00:21:37.327]  You're dead.
[00:21:38.809 --> 00:21:39.509]  I'm from Hong Kong.
[00:21:39.609 --> 00:21:40.110]  Die!
[00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:40.590]  Die!
[00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.031]  I'm a white devil!
[00:21:42.432 --> 00:21:45.694]  Just like Don Johnson in the White House funded machete kills.
[00:21:47.496 --> 00:21:49.477]  Here comes a poor pregnant Hispanic woman.
[00:21:50.038 --> 00:21:53.921]  He goes, I love killing Hispanics women and blows the baby out of her.
[00:21:55.376 --> 00:21:59.141]  Of course, 99% of the folks getting killed on the U.S.
[00:21:59.181 --> 00:22:01.824]  border are getting killed by the smugglers, by the coyotes.
[00:22:01.844 --> 00:22:08.232]  80 plus percent of the women and children coming across Amnesty International estimates are being raped.
[00:22:09.433 --> 00:22:11.236]  It ain't about Don Johnson.
[00:22:14.062 --> 00:22:15.723]  Don Johnson out there with his cowboy hat.
[00:22:16.144 --> 00:22:17.645]  I'm gonna kill Miss Mexican!
[00:22:17.705 --> 00:22:19.266]  I'm gonna shoot pregnant woman!
[00:22:19.706 --> 00:22:23.649]  It's all simulations of the white people murdering you.
[00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.071]  Simulations like a metaverse.
[00:22:27.673 --> 00:22:28.533]  So you're guilty.
[00:22:29.354 --> 00:22:30.315]  And other people hate you.
[00:22:30.675 --> 00:22:31.676]  Because you're running things.
[00:22:31.696 --> 00:22:33.497]  You got something special because you're white.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.361]  And what do we have that's special?
[00:22:40.302 --> 00:22:45.514]   Well, I mean, in The Greeks and the Roman Empire and a lot of other civilizations came and went.
[00:22:47.776 --> 00:22:48.877]  We're kind of going now, aren't we?
[00:22:50.117 --> 00:22:51.638]  Not from without, but from within.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.022]  We had the Renaissance 500 years ago, 500 years ago.
[00:22:56.742 --> 00:22:58.683]  And we had all the scientific revolutions we've seen.
[00:22:59.624 --> 00:23:03.727]  And you can kind of look back and say, maybe nuclear bombs might not have been a very good thing.
[00:23:03.747 --> 00:23:06.309]  And air conditioning, you'd say it's a great thing.
[00:23:06.669 --> 00:23:11.933]  I mean, think about everything the West invented, basically everything, in the modern world.
[00:23:14.192 --> 00:23:23.968]  No one can deny that before the rise of Islam, fifteen, six hundred years ago, the Middle East was the capital of science, and China was.
[00:23:25.552 --> 00:23:28.753]  As Rome had fallen, and they had the biggest advances.
[00:23:28.793 --> 00:23:30.313]  I'm not saying the Arabs aren't smart.
[00:23:30.893 --> 00:23:31.994]  I'm saying the Chinese aren't smart.
[00:23:32.014 --> 00:23:39.015]  I'm just telling you, America and the West peaked at the right time and got all this, okay?
[00:23:39.436 --> 00:23:44.737]  And also the basic freedoms to be in a lower class from another country, be able to move here and be a billionaire.
[00:23:47.116 --> 00:23:56.542]  But now the powerful elite don't want the world to aspire for anybody, whether you're black or Asian or white, to be able to go and be successful.
[00:23:56.602 --> 00:24:09.330]  So we have the carbon taxes and the globalism and the controls coming in to shut everybody else off in a new social credit score class system.
[00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:13.833]  Oh, but you're in a digital system where the AI tells you what class you're in.
[00:24:14.784 --> 00:24:17.546]  If you can travel, if you can have a car, what medicine do you get?
[00:24:18.186 --> 00:24:20.528]  It's the ultimate discrimination.
[00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:27.373]  But to roll it out, they go, oh, we're going to do a social credit score for women and black people because they're downtrodden.
[00:24:27.393 --> 00:24:30.014]  We're going to give them reparations.
[00:24:30.395 --> 00:24:33.737]  And then once that's set, you get a little digital card.
[00:24:34.397 --> 00:24:35.918]  Guys, there's a computer going off in here.
[00:24:35.938 --> 00:24:36.839]  It's been going off for a while.
[00:24:36.879 --> 00:24:37.940]  Keep them turned off for me, thanks.
[00:24:42.915 --> 00:24:45.376]  That's what we're dealing with here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:46.937 --> 00:24:50.259]  Now, let's start, well, we gotta go to break in a few minutes.
[00:24:50.499 --> 00:24:52.900]  I'm gonna come back and just plow through all this, but it's incredible.
[00:24:54.501 --> 00:25:07.367]  They are now installing leaders in Europe, of whole governments, and installing mayors, who weren't born in the country, can barely speak English, and literally say white people are terrorists.
[00:25:07.967 --> 00:25:09.208]  You go, why would you do that?
[00:25:10.703 --> 00:25:18.068]  Well, why does a pimp, once he gets a 16-year-old runaway or 15-year-old runaway, give her some drugs that are addicted to heroin or cocaine to control her?
[00:25:18.689 --> 00:25:19.890]  And at first, he's kind of nice to her.
[00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:26.995]  But then when she finally wants to leave and notices she's not getting hardly any of the money, well, he goes ahead and beats her up.
[00:25:30.305 --> 00:25:32.368]  But not too much at first, just to see if she'll go.
[00:25:32.408 --> 00:25:35.772]  When she doesn't, he knows he's got her and he starts beating her harder.
[00:25:36.313 --> 00:25:44.905]  Soon as she gets none of the money, soon as she's thrown out on the street with cigarette burns all over a year later, poured out to 5,000 men, and then she's a crack whore.
[00:25:46.636 --> 00:25:50.581]  The globalists, it's the same tactics all over the Western world, are here to break us.
[00:25:51.342 --> 00:25:51.703]  Everybody.
[00:25:51.963 --> 00:26:00.675]  With the COVID lockdowns and the forced injections and white people are inherently evil and climate change affects gay people more, oh you're all victims, and blacks more.
[00:26:01.616 --> 00:26:02.817]  Well, all our rights are being taken.
[00:26:02.837 --> 00:26:04.318]  We're all being attacked by the New World Order.
[00:26:04.819 --> 00:26:06.641]  They're coming after our unborn babies.
[00:26:07.521 --> 00:26:10.264]  80% plus of women that took the COVID shots had miscarriages.
[00:26:10.284 --> 00:26:11.185]  That's mainstream news.
[00:26:11.445 --> 00:26:13.747]  I mean, we're being devastated.
[00:26:13.767 --> 00:26:14.688]  22 million dead so far.
[00:26:14.708 --> 00:26:17.490]  A couple million of them under the age of 15 from the shots.
[00:26:18.471 --> 00:26:27.880]  But all we sit there and hear about is about how it's inherently evil to be white.
[00:26:30.649 --> 00:26:48.699]  So that's the divide and conquer situation that is going on and we as a people have to not be intimidated by it and we have to speak up against it of every race, color and creed and understand the clear evil agenda that is admitted.
[00:26:50.993 --> 00:26:51.693]  And reject it.
[00:26:52.414 --> 00:26:54.054]  One trillion percent.
[00:26:54.715 --> 00:27:01.398]  We have to go all out and say we know what you're doing, we understand the program, we see through it, and we do not accept it.
[00:27:02.338 --> 00:27:05.940]  We do not accept it at any level, in any way.
[00:27:09.892 --> 00:27:15.555]  Now I want to go through these clips and then I'm going to tell you what it's going to look like if they're successful and what is about to unfold.
[00:27:16.135 --> 00:27:21.638]  But literal hell on earth for everybody, except a tiny little percent at the top.
[00:27:22.779 --> 00:27:29.042]  And even though the general public will be losing its rights, they will then scramble with less resources to grovel to the system in hopes of not...
[00:27:30.333 --> 00:27:31.974]  Seeking faster, but they will.
[00:27:31.994 --> 00:27:32.955]  We'll be right back.
[00:27:33.355 --> 00:27:36.558]  So what I really want to ask you to do is pray for myself and the crew and my family.
[00:27:36.918 --> 00:27:37.659]  That's number one.
[00:27:37.719 --> 00:27:38.460]  I want that.
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:38.960]  I need that.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.381]  It's your prayer that's doing it.
[00:27:40.661 --> 00:27:41.542]  That's why this surfaced.
[00:27:41.562 --> 00:27:42.423]  That's why this happened.
[00:27:42.443 --> 00:27:43.904]  I need the prayer.
[00:27:44.905 --> 00:27:52.431]  That I need you to take the articles, the videos, the posts we make at Real Alex Jones, recopy them, share them, post them yourself, do whatever, just get it out there.
[00:27:53.291 --> 00:27:59.272]   And I need you To go to InfoWarsStore.com and I need you to get great products you already need.
[00:27:59.292 --> 00:28:00.593]  There's a bunch of sales going.
[00:28:01.253 --> 00:28:03.893]  DNA Force Plus is so good for your entire body.

[00:28:14.476 --> 00:28:15.417]  I haven't done that in a while.
[00:28:15.437 --> 00:28:16.057]  That's amazing.
[00:28:16.657 --> 00:28:22.761]  So, if you go back through all of human recorded history, 7,000 plus years that we've been recording it, everything was always race-based and travel-based.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:28.820]   Ultimate Turmeric Formula 40% off and Turbo Force 10-hour clean energy is 40%
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:33.269]  off at infowarestore.com. Turbo Force. We'll be right back.
[00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:38.550]   So if you go back through all of human recorded history 7,000 plus years that
[00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:43.169]   we've been recording it, everything was always race based and tribal
[00:28:43.169 --> 00:28:47.810]   based. That was the first thing. You might be in ancient Africa and the tribe
[00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:51.980]   over the hill might be your relatives but that's usually your main enemy
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.299]   from time to time you have a war weapon.
[00:28:54.836 --> 00:28:59.619]  Just like in the 80s and 90s, the Crips and the Bloods killed tens of thousands of each other.
[00:28:59.639 --> 00:29:00.280]  It was black people.
[00:29:01.141 --> 00:29:02.682]  But they're fighting over turf.
[00:29:03.122 --> 00:29:04.043]  So it's about resources.
[00:29:05.484 --> 00:29:09.976]   Just like if you've got a cat, I posted a video on Ecstasy about this.
[00:29:09.996 --> 00:29:15.878]  You think it's your nice house cat, but it's actually getting out of the house during the day and night, running around, running off other cats and attacking them.
[00:29:16.258 --> 00:29:18.639]  Because it thinks they're going to get the food in the house.
[00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:22.900]  Cat's real nice to you, but even your sweet house cat isn't as nice as you think it is.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.120]  Not in its territory.
[00:29:25.881 --> 00:29:33.343]  But under the Western idea, under Christianity, we had a way to unify people under culture who weren't the same color.
[00:29:33.943 --> 00:29:35.043]  And it made us powerful.
[00:29:36.624 --> 00:29:37.544]  And it's a unification.
[00:29:39.485 --> 00:29:57.430]  The globalists have analyzed the West and said, well, we'll use that open altruistic system against them and get them to submit to us by destroying the third world, organizing the hordes of people, then bringing them here, brainwashing them against the West, having them vote, having them undercut the workers, have them become the police and the military.
[00:29:57.751 --> 00:29:58.451]  And then it's checkmate.
[00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:05.633]  Roman emperors during the decline of Rome would bring in foreign troops and use them to control the Roman population.
[00:30:07.236 --> 00:30:09.517]  It's been done over and over and over again.
[00:30:09.577 --> 00:30:28.068]  So, just like a pimp tries to break his horse, if he's a mean pimp and he has that style of pimping, it's outrageous to see leaders from Pakistan and Kenya and China put in charge of government institutions unelected.
[00:30:29.809 --> 00:30:33.071]  First ministers put in installed by the party.
[00:30:34.132 --> 00:30:35.733]  Mayors installed by the government.
[00:30:37.042 --> 00:30:37.762]  That's new, isn't it?
[00:30:38.983 --> 00:30:43.085]  The head of the board in San Francisco.
[00:30:44.326 --> 00:30:45.266]  She was just brought on recently.
[00:30:45.306 --> 00:30:47.067]  Now, I was reading she's the head of it.
[00:30:48.207 --> 00:30:49.568]  It's Chinese, not even a U.S.
[00:30:49.588 --> 00:30:49.968]  citizen.
[00:30:50.589 --> 00:30:52.650]  And is a CCP operative, reportedly.
[00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:54.911]  Heavy ties.
[00:30:55.331 --> 00:30:57.592]  And why is she the head of the elections?
[00:30:58.352 --> 00:31:00.293]  Well, it's all about flaunting it.
[00:31:00.353 --> 00:31:01.994]  It's all about rubbing your face in it.
[00:31:02.014 --> 00:31:03.435]  It's all about dominating you.
[00:31:04.943 --> 00:31:07.986]  So that you give up and roll over and say, I'll do whatever you say.
[00:31:08.466 --> 00:31:08.986]  Stop doing it.
[00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:10.888]  I'm going to get to all these clips in a moment.
[00:31:12.069 --> 00:31:13.590]  Some very exciting announcements.

[00:32:29.892 --> 00:32:33.655]  Folic acid, but most people can't absorb all the folic acid or even part of it.
[00:32:33.675 --> 00:32:37.138]  A lot of people only absorb 10, 12, 13%.
[00:32:38.339 --> 00:32:39.259]  Most folks around half.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.181]  This is 100% absorption.
[00:32:43.163 --> 00:32:48.387]  It is the breakdown of folic acid with a bunch of other natural compounds to supercharge it.
[00:32:49.287 --> 00:32:51.749]  Next level of foundational energy, DrJonesNaturals.com.

[00:33:45.696 --> 00:33:46.497]  You've seen the effects.

[00:33:57.459 --> 00:34:01.461]  I'm saying we're the best there is on the battlefield and that means you're the best there is and I thank you and salute you.
[00:34:01.721 --> 00:34:02.662]  All right, I'm done talking about it.
[00:34:04.242 --> 00:34:04.763]  Mark it down.
[00:34:04.823 --> 00:34:05.903]  Don't forget, take action now.
[00:34:06.624 --> 00:34:08.525]  InfoWarsTore.com, DrJonesNaturals.com.
[00:34:10.285 --> 00:34:14.788]  Now, let's start over from where I was.
[00:34:16.684 --> 00:34:32.677]  There is a massive tipping point that we crossed the last six months where people across the board understand that there is a project to intimidate white people and others into accepting the entire political correctness pantheon.
[00:34:34.016 --> 00:34:37.098]  System, or you're a racist, or you're bad.
[00:34:37.638 --> 00:34:48.284]  And the biggest corporations, Black Rock Control, the governments, the CIA, the Defense Department, they are all pushing it and forcing it with devastating effect on the human civilization society.
[00:34:48.344 --> 00:34:49.145]  They're dividing people.
[00:34:50.565 --> 00:34:51.706]  They're race hustler pimps.
[00:34:53.387 --> 00:35:00.051]  And it is not the people of Africa and Latin America and Asia that are our enemies.
[00:35:01.038 --> 00:35:05.384]  They have been under globalist lockdowns and control and are refugees of the New World Order.
[00:35:05.604 --> 00:35:10.911]  But they're being used as a weapon against us and it's not going to save them or save us to let them flood in here.
[00:35:11.252 --> 00:35:14.256]  So I'm not for open borders and I say deport the military age men.
[00:35:15.398 --> 00:35:17.741]  Make people go through serious vetting to be here.
[00:35:19.013 --> 00:35:25.235]  But we can't look at this and then get on the level of the social engineers that want us to be in a clash of civilizations.
[00:35:25.275 --> 00:35:33.337]  We have to understand and stand against what they're doing, but understand the larger perpetrators of it and why it's so brazen.
[00:35:35.338 --> 00:35:38.559]  And there will be false flag terror attacks that will be staged in this system.
[00:35:39.879 --> 00:35:46.301]  Mass attacks on quote minorities with a majority, with cutouts, mentally ill people, or pure patsies.
[00:35:47.492 --> 00:35:50.233]  That are going to try to push this completely over the top.
[00:35:51.794 --> 00:35:52.994]  Because they have to have that.
[00:35:53.014 --> 00:36:04.058]  And they've already pre-programmed the FBI for that, saying the number one crime in America is white supremacy, when it is one of the rarest crimes in America and in Europe of whites attacking people because of the color of their skin.
[00:36:04.098 --> 00:36:04.858]  It's super rare.
[00:36:05.178 --> 00:36:06.659]  When it happens, you never hear the end of it.
[00:36:06.999 --> 00:36:12.321]  They mainly use cases where police make a mistake or do the wrong thing, which is still pretty rare.
[00:36:13.294 --> 00:36:18.817]  And then they hype it like it's the end of the world, because they just can't find that unicorn of evil they're looking for.
[00:36:18.837 --> 00:36:25.940]  They can't find that lucky charms leprechaun that gives them the guilt and the fear they need.
[00:36:28.241 --> 00:36:35.364]  But I said two years ago, I said, I believe imminent attacks on black universities, churches, and grocery stores.
[00:36:35.404 --> 00:36:56.459]   In fact, I said, from what I've seen with the federal provocateurs, The feds are going to try to get some mentally ill white supremacist to kidnap a black preacher or congressperson or they're just going to shoot up a black college or church or the easiest thing is to have one of their mentally ill operatives hit a black grocery store.
[00:36:57.019 --> 00:36:58.240]  I said that probably ten times.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.340]  It was evidence and data but it also came to me in the ether.
[00:37:02.841 --> 00:37:13.103]   I got another dream and I woke up and I tried to remember it and then I Close my eyes again and forgot it but I got a big data download about 5 a.m.
[00:37:13.123 --> 00:37:13.984]  this morning about 3 30 a.m.
[00:37:14.004 --> 00:37:30.824]   That's why I woke up was posting on X for about an hour I'm going back to bed and it's gonna come back to me but it was dealing with a racially based terror attack it was really horrible dream but I you know dreams are you catch it and you lose it That's kind of the added ingredient that I come to these things with.
[00:37:30.884 --> 00:37:38.087]  And you did see in Buffalo, about two months after I just said it every day, they're going to attack black grocery stores.
[00:37:38.167 --> 00:37:38.507]  It happened.
[00:37:38.527 --> 00:37:39.967]  It turned out the feds were in there.
[00:37:40.227 --> 00:37:41.087]  They knew what he was doing.
[00:37:41.468 --> 00:37:42.368]  He was being protected.
[00:37:42.388 --> 00:37:43.588]  He was planning it for a long time.
[00:37:44.969 --> 00:37:45.609]  Let's skip this break.
[00:37:46.649 --> 00:37:48.090]  That was documented.
[00:37:50.771 --> 00:37:56.935]  So 99% of what I do is temporarily looking at all the evidence, but that last 1% is the discernment, the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:58.176 --> 00:38:09.983]  So they're not going to get away with all this without attacks on blacks, on gays, on women, on Muslims.
[00:38:11.604 --> 00:38:16.006]  And then that'll be the excuse for the big Islamic attacks that then come out of that.
[00:38:16.226 --> 00:38:19.746]   Trump is re-elected, then the Democrats say they've already got legislation introduced
[00:38:19.746 --> 00:38:24.786]   with Senator Blumenthal and others, which is a coup by the way, to strip the executive branch of
[00:38:24.786 --> 00:38:30.065]   the power of domestic military under the Insurrection Act that George Walker Bush used in '92 during the
[00:38:30.065 --> 00:38:35.105]   LA riots. So they're already war gaming that okay, it looks like he's going to get back in.
[00:38:35.105 --> 00:38:39.585]   We can't steal an election when there's a landslide this big.
[00:38:39.816 --> 00:38:42.798]  So as soon as he's president-elect, we'll have a huge uprising.
[00:38:43.178 --> 00:38:45.860]  Bill all the MAGA people as white supremacists.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:47.561]  Well, that's not working.
[00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:48.502]  That's not hunting.
[00:38:48.782 --> 00:38:49.923]  That dog isn't hunting.
[00:38:50.243 --> 00:38:51.444]  That plane isn't flying.
[00:38:53.065 --> 00:38:54.185]  That cake ain't rising.
[00:38:55.006 --> 00:38:56.467]  Them biscuits ain't rising.
[00:38:57.227 --> 00:38:57.908]  It's not working.
[00:38:59.124 --> 00:39:00.124]  That engine isn't starting.
[00:39:00.924 --> 00:39:07.165]  So it's very easy to say, with their history of false flags and staged events, that we're about to have that happen.
[00:39:07.185 --> 00:39:10.706]  And I just want you to know that I'm telling you right now, I think it's imminent.
[00:39:12.727 --> 00:39:13.147]  It's imminent.
[00:39:15.687 --> 00:39:23.369]  And it's something that they're really pissed off at me about because I predict this stuff and it almost always happens.
[00:39:23.509 --> 00:39:25.769]  Sometimes we're able to stop it because we get ahead of it.
[00:39:26.474 --> 00:39:28.515]  And then it adds even more credibility when it happens.
[00:39:28.535 --> 00:39:35.077]  I don't want it to happen, and I think we've got enough credibility here without things continuing to come true that I say, but it's very easy to extrapolate this out.
[00:39:36.018 --> 00:39:46.121]  You've got major budget movies and TV shows everywhere where whites are killing black people and Asians en masse, and there's an uprising to stop the evil white people.
[00:39:49.583 --> 00:39:52.504]  Six months before 9-11, the Pearl Harbor movie came out.
[00:39:54.366 --> 00:39:58.408]  That was another reason I said I believe they're getting ready to stage false flags because I can just see it everywhere.
[00:40:00.569 --> 00:40:12.634]  Chris Carter was approached by the CIA and said, why don't you do a piece about a jumbo jet hijacked by remote control flying the World Trade Center by a rogue element in the government to launch a war in Afghanistan and set up martial law in America.
[00:40:15.096 --> 00:40:16.136]  Look it up, he gave interviews about it.
[00:40:16.956 --> 00:40:19.317]  Eye on air asked him, I said, Chris, did the CIA approach you?
[00:40:19.337 --> 00:40:20.738]  He said, strangely enough, Alex, they did.
[00:40:21.338 --> 00:40:22.399]  Look up the articles, he talked about it.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.183]  We've talked some on email and he invited me out to LA but I never got out there.
[00:40:27.243 --> 00:40:31.607]  But the point is we would communicate through broadcast and he would talk to the newspapers and respond back.
[00:40:31.627 --> 00:40:32.307]  You can pull those up.
[00:40:33.288 --> 00:40:36.892]  So, he doesn't know why the CIA came and had him make that show.
[00:40:37.172 --> 00:40:42.757]  You can say good guys inside the CIA were trying to get out to the public because they knew about the 9-11 plan to warn people.
[00:40:43.178 --> 00:40:44.319]  Or was it predictive programming?
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.282]  They didn't tell Chris Carter.
[00:40:49.611 --> 00:40:59.540]  At the cocktail party, where he talked to the CIA high-level agent for 30 minutes, and he told him the plot of the Lone Gunman episode that we have on screen.
[00:41:01.161 --> 00:41:06.086]  If you're a new listener and don't know about this, just type in, X-Files Lone Gunman 9-11 episode.
[00:41:07.447 --> 00:41:08.848]  Came out months before 9-11.
[00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:15.374]  So, that's what we're dealing with here, and I'm telling you, it's imminent.
[00:41:16.775 --> 00:41:25.524]  I don't know exactly what type of attack it will specifically be or where, but you can bet your bottom, Benjamin, that it's going down and that we will be blamed.
[00:41:25.565 --> 00:41:38.699]  In fact, good chance whoever the killers are, or killers, when they go to their apartment or their camp or their base, you know, it's going to be Alex Jones books and films everywhere and then they'll call for my arrest.
[00:41:40.476 --> 00:41:41.897]  It's already happened quite a bit.
[00:41:42.777 --> 00:41:43.498]  It's a lot of fun.
[00:41:44.398 --> 00:41:46.059]  They produce all these TV shows attacking me.
[00:41:46.519 --> 00:41:50.101]  Fiction shows like... Oh, there's been so many.
[00:41:52.402 --> 00:41:53.882]  Homeland, what goes on and on.
[00:41:55.723 --> 00:41:57.244]  They even admitted that character was based on me.
[00:41:58.845 --> 00:42:00.726]  But that's how scared they are of populists.
[00:42:00.826 --> 00:42:03.627]  Because they think if they can demonize me, they can demonize you when you tell the truth.
[00:42:04.468 --> 00:42:06.148]  Okay, so let's start getting to the videos.
[00:42:06.208 --> 00:42:07.169]  Let's go to this first one.
[00:42:08.868 --> 00:42:20.152]  With a disgusting communist in Vancouver talking about loving Hamas and loving what happened on October 7th.
[00:42:20.172 --> 00:42:24.214]  Here it is.
[00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:29.801]  from the river to the sea.
[00:42:29.801 --> 00:42:31.801]  [APPLAUSE]
[00:42:31.801 --> 00:42:38.801]   And that we stand with the Palestinian resistance and their heroic and brave action on October 7th.
[00:42:38.801 --> 00:42:41.801]  And they said, "Long live October 7th."
[00:42:41.801 --> 00:42:43.801]  [APPLAUSE]
[00:42:43.801 --> 00:42:47.801]  And we say today, "Long live October 7th."
[00:42:47.801 --> 00:42:49.801]  [APPLAUSE]
[00:42:49.801 --> 00:42:51.801]  They wanted to meet.
[00:42:51.801 --> 00:42:55.801]  Justin Trudeau denounced that statement.
[00:42:55.801 --> 00:42:58.801]  Pierre Poitlibs denounced that statement.
[00:42:58.801 --> 00:43:04.801]   Every one of these Canadian politicians who could not find one word
[00:43:04.801 --> 00:43:09.801]  to denounce the slaughter of 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza.
[00:43:09.801 --> 00:43:16.801]   What's incredible about that creature's logic, that hippopotamus, is that
[00:43:16.801 --> 00:43:17.301]  dead.
[00:43:17.301 --> 00:43:27.301]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:43:20.362 --> 00:43:24.124]  She supports coming over the border and killing women and children and men.
[00:43:26.005 --> 00:43:30.568]  And then when Israel overreacts, that's the worst thing ever seen in the world.
[00:43:32.729 --> 00:43:40.114]  But she loves attacks on civilians when it's Jews, but she hates it when it's against the Muslims.
[00:43:40.154 --> 00:43:42.435]  See, I don't like it against the Jews or the Muslims.
[00:43:42.475 --> 00:43:43.355]  That's how I do things.
[00:43:43.696 --> 00:43:44.836]  I just call balls and strikes.
[00:43:44.856 --> 00:43:47.618]  I don't want to be in the middle of this tribal warfare over there.
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:50.440]  I know Israel founded Hamas.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.840]  I know Israel stood down.
[00:43:52.101 --> 00:43:52.761]  That's the whole point.
[00:43:52.781 --> 00:44:01.522]  I know Obama, Biden's puppet, Biden's the puppet of Obama, gave the money to Iran to do all this, and I predicted it all, and here we are!
[00:44:02.122 --> 00:44:09.024]  And George Soros is funding all these groups around the world, and the pro-Islamic uprisings, and destroy, kill Israel, kill the Jew stuff.
[00:44:09.284 --> 00:44:12.704]  Did you hear Benjamin Netanyahu talk about George Soros?
[00:44:12.784 --> 00:44:13.004]  No.
[00:44:13.445 --> 00:44:15.405]  Because they're working together.
[00:44:18.581 --> 00:44:20.721]  To create destabilization.
[00:44:20.741 --> 00:44:24.942]  And the Iranians, who are super unpopular with the government, they've got an excuse for control now.
[00:44:25.783 --> 00:44:26.483]  Here's some more video.
[00:44:26.543 --> 00:44:27.663]  I mean, I've got dozens of these.
[00:44:28.723 --> 00:44:41.146]  This is a LAPD officer pulls out his gun on Palestinian activists carrying a sword at a university protest, chanting, Long live the Intifada.
[00:44:40.986 --> 00:44:41.986]  Here it is.
[00:44:41.986 --> 00:44:42.986]  You need to cooperate, okay?
[00:44:42.986 --> 00:44:43.986]  A sword, bro?
[00:44:43.986 --> 00:44:44.986]  A sword, bro?
[00:44:44.986 --> 00:44:45.986]  What the fuck are you doing, pig?
[00:44:45.986 --> 00:44:46.986]  Now, let's stop there.
[00:44:46.986 --> 00:44:47.986]  What the fuck are you doing?
[00:44:47.986 --> 00:44:48.986]  They're just trying to get the money out of the people.
[00:44:48.986 --> 00:44:49.986]  I'm not trying to get the money out of the people.
[00:44:49.986 --> 00:44:50.986]  I'm trying to get the money out of the people.
[00:44:50.986 --> 00:44:51.986]  I'm not trying to get the money out of the people.
[00:44:51.986 --> 00:44:52.986]  I'm trying to get the money out of the people.
[00:44:52.986 --> 00:44:53.986]  I'm trying to get the money out of the people.
[00:44:53.986 --> 00:44:54.986]  I'm trying to get the money out of the people.
[00:44:54.986 --> 00:44:55.986]  I'm trying to get the money out of the people.
[00:44:55.986 --> 00:44:56.986]  I'm trying to get the money out of the people.
[00:44:56.986 --> 00:44:57.986]  I'm trying to get the money out of the people.
[00:44:57.986 --> 00:45:04.466]  I'm trying to get the money out of the people.
[00:45:04.444 --> 00:45:05.684]  They just cut too much to play the thing.
[00:45:05.724 --> 00:45:07.225]  I thought we bleeped this but I guess we didn't.
[00:45:08.246 --> 00:45:12.009]  Get it bleeped guys and add it in post once we post this to Bandai Video and ask police.
[00:45:12.369 --> 00:45:13.129]  Add it in post, thank you.
[00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:21.324]   But the point is, is that I think people should be able to carry swords and guns.
[00:45:21.344 --> 00:45:23.786]  It makes for a very polite society.
[00:45:25.228 --> 00:45:29.692]  But you notice in L.A., oh, the big crime is somebody having a gun or a sword.
[00:45:30.032 --> 00:45:32.774]  And yeah, it's some little communist LARPing, wanting to feel powerful.
[00:45:33.615 --> 00:45:37.999]  But for all we know, it's not being reported that he threatened anybody with it.
[00:45:39.941 --> 00:45:44.205]  So, the point is, though, is they are looking for violence in the end.
[00:45:45.066 --> 00:45:50.429]  And we can't let the uprisings that are about to be triggered, that have already begun, be the pretext for the government to take our guns.
[00:45:51.389 --> 00:45:53.030]  More guns, not less guns.
[00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:58.452]  Because the government and the state can't and won't and isn't going to come protect you.
[00:46:01.194 --> 00:46:06.576]  But out of this crisis, this angrier world that Klaus Schwab talks about, that's what they want to happen.
[00:46:07.076 --> 00:46:14.460]  Now I want to go to a clip of the Scottish First Minister, Humza Yousaf, has finally resigned.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.802]  After calling out the white members of the Scottish government.
[00:46:19.322 --> 00:46:24.925]  And he did try to do all this political correct stuff and fire white people that were qualified to replace him with illegal aliens.
[00:46:25.505 --> 00:46:27.766]  I mean, this is just a very aggressive move.
[00:46:28.446 --> 00:46:31.188]  And he's now been removed.
[00:46:32.495 --> 00:46:32.915]  Here it is.
[00:46:33.796 --> 00:46:34.877]  The Lord Justice Clerk.
[00:46:35.218 --> 00:46:35.458]  White.
[00:46:36.099 --> 00:46:37.220]  Every High Court Judge.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:37.920]  White.
[00:46:38.301 --> 00:46:39.181]  The Lord Advocate.
[00:46:39.562 --> 00:46:39.822]  White.
[00:46:40.162 --> 00:46:41.003]  The Solicitor General.
[00:46:41.323 --> 00:46:41.564]  White.
[00:46:41.864 --> 00:46:42.665]  The Chief Constable.
[00:46:42.965 --> 00:46:43.185]  White.
[00:46:43.706 --> 00:46:45.087]  Every Deputy Chief Constable.
[00:46:45.327 --> 00:46:45.568]  White.
[00:46:46.068 --> 00:46:47.469]  Every Assistant Chief Constable.
[00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.970]  White.
[00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:49.731]  The Head of the Law Society.
[00:46:49.972 --> 00:46:50.212]  White.
[00:46:50.612 --> 00:46:52.134]  The Head of the Faculty of Advocates.
[00:46:52.554 --> 00:46:52.774]  White.
[00:46:53.235 --> 00:46:55.077]  Every Prison Governor.
[00:46:55.497 --> 00:46:55.757]  White.
[00:46:56.218 --> 00:46:57.078]  And not just Justice.
[00:46:57.659 --> 00:46:59.120]  The Chief Medical Officer, white.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:00.981]  The Chief Nursing Officer, white.
[00:47:01.461 --> 00:47:02.882]  The Chief Veterinary Officer, white.
[00:47:03.402 --> 00:47:05.363]  The Chief Social Work Advisor, white.
[00:47:05.923 --> 00:47:10.446]  Almost every trade union in this country headed by people who are white.
[00:47:10.826 --> 00:47:13.847]  In the Scottish Government, every Director General is white.
[00:47:14.288 --> 00:47:17.609]  Every chair of every public body is white.
[00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:24.293]  Imagine going to Nigeria and the party appoints you the First Minister.
[00:47:24.313 --> 00:47:26.754]  That's how it works, like the President or the Prime Minister there is appointed.
[00:47:28.567 --> 00:47:35.668]  And you get up in front of the Nigerians and you say that every single minister is a Nigerian, is black, and is African.
[00:47:36.108 --> 00:47:41.809]  Imagine going to China and saying every single member of the Communist Party is Chinese here, or the Politburo.
[00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:43.270]  They'd laugh you out of the place.
[00:47:47.831 --> 00:47:50.931]  But see, he's supposed to be able to do that and push that.
[00:47:51.451 --> 00:48:01.475]   Here is Biden, and he's there with Mayorkas, This is like, what, eight years ago.
[00:48:01.495 --> 00:48:01.475]  2015.
[00:48:03.215 --> 00:48:03.875]  Nine years ago.
[00:48:05.395 --> 00:48:08.416]  And here he is planning what they've already done now.
[00:48:08.816 --> 00:48:16.417]  Totally breaking the border, paying all these dividends to have people come here, making the illegals exempt from the poison shots, giving them ninety-something thousand dollars a year apiece.
[00:48:17.057 --> 00:48:21.598]  All of this to bring in the replacements.
[00:48:21.638 --> 00:48:22.058]  Here he is.
[00:48:23.059 --> 00:48:25.379]  And the wave still continues.
[00:48:26.505 --> 00:48:27.406]  It's not going to stop.
[00:48:28.487 --> 00:48:30.048]  Nor should we want it to stop.
[00:48:31.169 --> 00:48:36.454]  As a matter of fact, it's one of the things I think we can be most proud of.
[00:48:37.395 --> 00:48:40.678]  So there's a second thing in that black box.
[00:48:41.399 --> 00:48:43.621]  An unrelenting stream of immigration.
[00:48:44.602 --> 00:48:45.583]  Non-stop.
[00:48:46.383 --> 00:48:47.104]  Non-stop.
[00:48:48.566 --> 00:48:58.875]   Folks like me, who are Caucasian of European descent, For the first time in 2017, we'll be in an absolute minority in the United States of America.
[00:48:59.756 --> 00:49:00.737]  Absolute minority.
[00:49:01.698 --> 00:49:09.304]  Fewer than 50% of the people in America, from then and on, will be white European stock.
[00:49:09.885 --> 00:49:10.946]  That's not a bad thing.
[00:49:11.486 --> 00:49:13.128]  That's a source of our strength.
[00:49:13.555 --> 00:49:15.715]  At the Wall Street Journal, they are counting.
[00:49:15.715 --> 00:49:21.555]   I would do as president, several more things, because things have changed.
[00:49:21.555 --> 00:49:26.755]   I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[00:49:26.755 --> 00:49:28.635]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[00:49:28.635 --> 00:49:29.815]  They deserve to be heard.
[00:49:29.815 --> 00:49:30.815]  That's who we are.
[00:49:30.815 --> 00:49:34.274]   We're a nation that says if you wanna flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should
[00:49:34.274 --> 00:49:35.274]  come.
[00:49:35.274 --> 00:49:39.795]   But then he said the border wasn't broken, now he says it is, and it's Trump's fault,
[00:49:39.795 --> 00:49:43.875]   even though Trump basically shut it down 97% compared to where it is now.
[00:49:44.447 --> 00:49:45.007]  Look at the graphs.
[00:49:45.728 --> 00:49:58.636]  And then of course Charlie Kirk over the weekend was speaking at a university, and the leftist gets up and says, yeah, we are bringing illegal aliens in for replacement, and they are going to vote, and they are going to keep the Democrats in power.
[00:49:59.677 --> 00:50:05.881]  They're not even denying this stuff, but if you say that, the ADL will lobby to have you taken off every major platform.
[00:50:07.045 --> 00:50:10.326]  Even though it's an official battle plan with these people.
[00:50:10.366 --> 00:50:14.207]  And look, it's another white liberal who wants to pray racial politics.
[00:50:14.427 --> 00:50:14.807]  Here it is.
[00:50:17.908 --> 00:50:21.269]  All right, we're having an issue with the computer today.
[00:50:21.289 --> 00:50:22.230]  Let's just stop for a moment.
[00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:23.710]  Let's just clear our minds for a second.
[00:50:25.731 --> 00:50:28.171]  And we're not going to go to that clip right now.
[00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:30.492]  Get the mayor of Derby ready, please, in Ireland.
[00:50:31.312 --> 00:50:32.973]  And we are going to play that.
[00:50:34.096 --> 00:50:37.401]  And then we are going to play the other clip that we were just about to show you here.
[00:50:40.425 --> 00:50:42.829]  This is the mayor of Derby.
[00:50:42.949 --> 00:50:44.111]  She has been appointed.
[00:50:45.356 --> 00:50:47.458]  She was not elected, that's the new system there.
[00:50:48.219 --> 00:50:56.768]  And she says that white people not liking totally open borders and paying for all these people, 80% of them that never get a job, are racist and are terrorists and must be silenced.
[00:50:56.808 --> 00:51:04.357]  And we have video, I posted on X today, of paramilitary police going to people's houses and beating them up because of things they've said and done in Ireland.
[00:51:04.617 --> 00:51:06.859]  So I predict major uprisings to come from this.
[00:51:06.879 --> 00:51:07.180]  Here it is.
[00:51:08.055 --> 00:51:12.638]  Everyone is living on edge right now and we need to do something about it.
[00:51:12.698 --> 00:51:17.200]  We cannot continue ignoring that this is a small minority of far-right movie.
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:25.224]  It is an organized terrorist group of people who want to harm immigrants in this country and we have to take action now.
[00:51:25.644 --> 00:51:34.206]   We can't keep on calling them a small dangerous group of people because it is an organized group of people who are radicalizing young people and
[00:51:34.206 --> 00:51:38.716]   encouraging them to go and harm others who are just living peacefully, who wants to live a
[00:51:38.716 --> 00:51:40.126]  peaceful life in this country.
[00:51:40.126 --> 00:51:44.847]  All right, now here is the clip of Charlie Kirk.
[00:51:45.125 --> 00:51:46.987]  Lowest unemployment in 60 years, baby.
[00:51:47.247 --> 00:51:48.108]  What about inflation?
[00:51:48.148 --> 00:51:49.609]  You have any questions about inflation?
[00:51:49.769 --> 00:51:50.830]  Inflation's going down.
[00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:51.850]  Actually, it's going up.
[00:51:52.331 --> 00:51:52.891]  It's going down!
[00:51:53.272 --> 00:51:54.352]  Gas prices are down!
[00:51:54.653 --> 00:51:55.513]  Gas prices are down!
[00:51:55.773 --> 00:51:56.814]  Inflation is down!
[00:51:57.094 --> 00:51:57.975]  Cope!
[00:51:58.415 --> 00:51:58.776]  Seed!
[00:51:59.376 --> 00:52:00.977]  Why is the Fed then raising rates?
[00:52:01.298 --> 00:52:03.419]  How many illegals are coming across the border every day?
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:04.340]  A lot.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:06.362]  So about 10 to 15,000 a day.
[00:52:06.382 --> 00:52:07.983]  Do you think Joe Biden- And they're all gonna vote Dem.
[00:52:10.625 --> 00:52:11.325]  Can you say that again?
[00:52:12.126 --> 00:52:12.787]  The illegals?
[00:52:13.147 --> 00:52:14.568]  Well, illegals.
[00:52:15.449 --> 00:52:16.310]  Yeah, they're coming here.
[00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:23.716]  They're going to vote Democrat and we're going to win.
[00:52:24.096 --> 00:52:29.120]  So you're admitting the border is a political tactic by the Democrat Party?
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:33.424]  Joe Biden is opening the floodgates of this country because he wants to hold on to political power.
[00:52:33.724 --> 00:52:35.145]  We've been saying this for a long time.
[00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:35.706]  Proof.
[00:52:37.858 --> 00:52:39.458]  What is he doing to secure the border?
[00:52:39.458 --> 00:52:40.458]  Let's stop right there.
[00:52:40.458 --> 00:52:43.057]  Notice the leftist goes back to gaslighting.
[00:52:43.057 --> 00:52:49.858]   Because they have nothing but arrogance and hubris and nothing but just mental illness.
[00:52:49.819 --> 00:52:53.121]  I mean, the guy looks like, you know, a really creepy person.

[00:54:49.389 --> 00:54:53.389]  [Splash]
[00:54:53.389 --> 00:54:55.389]  [Explosion]
[00:54:55.389 --> 00:55:01.389]   ...exactly what they're considering here, which is the question of whether a president has absolute immunity.
[00:55:02.387 --> 00:55:03.828]  And then there's a second question here.
[00:55:03.989 --> 00:55:09.372]  Biden Lawfare Circus has taken a dangerous turn for the former psychotics-in-chief.
[00:55:09.672 --> 00:55:11.914]  I don't know why we're surprised by Trump.
[00:55:12.054 --> 00:55:14.656]  How many times does he have to prove we can't be trusted?
[00:55:15.036 --> 00:55:21.140]  Trump attorney D. John Sauer presented a moment of clarity to the power-mad deep state pawns.
[00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:26.764]  Without presidential immunity from criminal prosecution, there can be no presidency as we know it.
[00:55:26.944 --> 00:55:32.869]  For 234 years of American history, no president was ever prosecuted for his official acts.
[00:55:33.169 --> 00:55:47.400]   If a president can be charged, put on trial, and imprisoned for his most controversial decisions as soon as he leaves office, That looming threat will distort the president's decision-making precisely when bold and fearless action is most needed.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:54.145]  Every current president will face de facto blackmail and extortion by his political rivals while he is still in office.
[00:55:54.585 --> 00:56:04.632]  Could President George W. Bush have been sent to prison for obstructing an official proceeding or allegedly lying to Congress to induce war in Iraq?
[00:56:04.913 --> 00:56:12.151]   The decision of one man Could President Obama be charged with murder for killing U.S.
[00:56:11.971 --> 00:56:14.570]  of Iraq, I mean of Ukraine.
[00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:17.730]  Could President Obama be charged with murder for killing U.S.
[00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:20.210]   citizens abroad by drone strike?
[00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:24.409]   But these decisions must be made, given my responsibility to protect the American people.
[00:56:24.733 --> 00:56:32.876]  Could President Biden someday be charged with unlawfully inducing immigrants to enter the country illegally for his border policies?
[00:56:33.197 --> 00:56:37.838]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[00:56:38.419 --> 00:56:52.666]   The original meaning of the executive vesting clause, the framers understanding and intent, In unbroken historical tradition, spanning 200 years, and policy considerations rooted in the separation of powers, all counsel against it.
[00:56:52.987 --> 00:57:03.093]  Meanwhile, Biden, DOJ attorney Michael Dreeben, and special counsel Jack Smith attempted to claim the Constitution does not grant presidential immunity.
[00:57:03.193 --> 00:57:12.519]  Of course, Dreeben, when asked if Obama could be tried for murder for the drone strikes, he has openly admitted to, argued this could not be the case.
[00:57:13.019 --> 00:57:19.122]  Mr. Dreeben, are you saying that there's no immunity, presidential immunity, even for official acts?
[00:57:19.462 --> 00:57:20.723]  Yes, Justice Thomas.
[00:57:21.003 --> 00:57:40.533]  The president, as the head of the Article 2 branch, can assert, as applied, Article 2 objections to criminal laws that interfere with an exclusive power possessed by the president or that prevent the president from accomplishing his constitutionally assigned functions.
[00:57:40.813 --> 00:57:47.862]   Fortunately or unfortunately, there is a long-standing history of criminal activity protected by this assumed
[00:57:47.862 --> 00:57:53.193]   immunity, as Justice Clarence Thomas pointed out regarding the JFK-era
[00:57:53.193 --> 00:57:58.313]  CIA Operation Mongoose and subsequently Operation Northwoods.
[00:57:58.313 --> 00:58:08.512]   Not so distant past, certain presidents have engaged in various activity coups or operations like Operation Mongoose,
[00:58:08.512 --> 00:58:10.512]  And yet there were no prosecutions.
[00:58:10.512 --> 00:58:11.012]  Yes.
[00:58:11.012 --> 00:58:11.512]  Why?
[00:58:12.413 --> 00:58:20.115]  If what you're saying is right, it would seem that that would have been right for criminal prosecution of someone.
[00:58:20.996 --> 00:58:23.716]  So Justice Thomas, I think this is a central question.
[00:58:24.096 --> 00:58:30.958]  The reason why there have not been prior criminal prosecutions is that there were not crimes.
[00:58:31.078 --> 00:58:36.821]  We're looking at a plan to blow things up on American soil, and then to blame it all on Cuba.
[00:58:37.201 --> 00:58:41.003]  Operation Mongoose was a multifaceted chess game played on the global stage.
[00:58:41.643 --> 00:58:46.145]  Covert operations took on various forms, from sabotage to propaganda campaigns.
[00:58:46.665 --> 00:58:51.908]  The objective was create internal dissent, sow discord, and ultimately overthrow Castro's regime.
[00:58:52.168 --> 00:58:55.650]  Careful what you ask for, Deep State Lawfare adherents.
[00:58:56.210 --> 00:59:00.793]  Even a kid waving his middle finger at decrepit, derelict Biden knows.
[00:59:01.193 --> 00:59:03.334]  A little kid standing with his middle finger.
[00:59:03.854 --> 00:59:05.355]  Seven years old, eight years old.
[00:59:06.152 --> 00:59:07.813]  Well, I promise it happens all the time.
[00:59:08.073 --> 00:59:16.636]  The only thing separating Biden from a prison cell is his presidential immunity marinating in plausible deniability.
[00:59:16.916 --> 00:59:21.518]  And I remember looking at Jim Biden and saying, how are you guys getting away with this?
[00:59:21.618 --> 00:59:23.219]  Like, aren't you concerned?
[00:59:23.239 --> 00:59:28.881]  And he looked at me and he laughed a little bit and said, plausible deniability.
[00:59:30.074 --> 00:59:30.774]  He said that out loud?
[00:59:30.975 --> 00:59:38.319]  Biden's legal crew may be creating a path to a doomed reconstruction of the presidential power that they serve.
[00:59:38.639 --> 00:59:41.161]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.
[00:59:42.401 --> 00:59:45.864]  Alright folks, we've got the Brazilian journalist exiled to the U.S.
[00:59:46.524 --> 00:59:47.024]  coming up.
[00:59:47.404 --> 00:59:49.786]  They're trying to arrest Elon Musk over not freezing his account.
[00:59:54.025 --> 00:59:56.807]  All right, welcome back to our number two.
[00:59:56.887 --> 01:00:07.775]  We have a exiled top journalist from Brazil, Elon Musk, unblocked when the Brazilian government ordered him to be blocked and lower-level ex-folks did that.
[01:00:07.815 --> 01:00:08.476]  He unblocked him.
[01:00:09.396 --> 01:00:12.318]  Now they've been arresting ex-employees and other things down there.
[01:00:12.959 --> 01:00:13.419]  It's insane.
[01:00:13.439 --> 01:00:16.902]  He joins us in about 10-15 minutes coming up.
[01:00:16.962 --> 01:00:18.483]  It's a huge deal.
[01:00:19.972 --> 01:00:22.253]  Alan Dos Santos will be joining us.
[01:00:22.834 --> 01:00:25.075]  It's a huge story and so important.
[01:00:25.175 --> 01:00:28.016]  And there's hearings coming up next month with Elon Musk in Congress about this.
[01:00:28.036 --> 01:00:28.957]  This is a big deal.
[01:00:29.397 --> 01:00:34.399]  Foreign governments trying to censor us here in America and suppress their own people with the State Department.
[01:00:34.439 --> 01:00:47.646]  It came out weeks ago, I told you this years ago, but is in Brazil helping suppress the wildly popular Bolsonaro and many, many others that they're now taking off the ballots and trying to put in prison or putting in prison.
[01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:48.647]  It's just a reign of terror.
[01:00:49.207 --> 01:00:49.968]  That's all coming up.
[01:00:50.848 --> 01:00:57.573]  And that ties in to the main headline that I posted this morning dealing with this show.
[01:00:57.853 --> 01:00:58.614]  We can put it on screen.
[01:00:59.354 --> 01:01:11.746]   The globalists are officially promoting and planning at the universities, at the think tanks, the CIA, and in the big movies that are out, both fiction and nonfiction, A civil war.
[01:01:11.966 --> 01:01:16.169]  Monday Live, Deep State preparing to trigger communist uprisings in America to trigger a civil war.
[01:01:16.249 --> 01:01:17.670]  But it's not a civil war.
[01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:25.075]  It's a communist uprising with the Islamists and the illegals and the Black Lives Matter and the communists.
[01:01:25.575 --> 01:01:39.204]  And the Democrats say when Trump then is president-elect is not able to call out the Insurrection Act, they believe they will be able to drive him from office before he ever takes the oath fully on January 21st.
[01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:45.929]  2025.
[01:01:43.126 --> 01:01:45.929]  And you know folks, I don't say things just to be dramatic.
[01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:51.935]  I've been saying dramatic things for 30 years on air, and almost all of it's come true because I follow the enemy battle plan.
[01:01:53.305 --> 01:01:54.286]  They are prepping this.
[01:01:54.566 --> 01:01:55.787]  They have got it ready to go.
[01:01:55.807 --> 01:02:11.098]  And every day for the next 188 days till the election, I am going to be talking about this and focusing in on it so that we don't get blindsided by this and we war game how to respond to it, how to deal with it, and not be sucked into it.
[01:02:11.118 --> 01:02:14.201]  They're planning a race-based communist uprising.
[01:02:14.957 --> 01:02:19.879]  Because they can never get minorities to join communism en masse in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.
[01:02:20.199 --> 01:02:23.960]  So now they've made it about a racial clash and liberation theology.
[01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:25.720]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:02:26.381 --> 01:02:28.721]  So it is a big, big deal.
[01:02:30.202 --> 01:02:39.104]  They're guaranteed winding up white supremacist groups and others, like the groups they tried to have kidnap Governor Whitmer, to stage some major events.
[01:02:39.945 --> 01:02:48.598]   The good news is people are so aware of this That it's very hard for the FBI to carry these plots out.
[01:02:49.818 --> 01:02:53.380]  So, Sunshine is the best disinfectant.
[01:02:54.421 --> 01:03:15.403]   Now I want to air some segments here that we've added some documentation to from the Patrick Bet-David podcast with Jesse Watters, where he talks about the fact that the FBI was involved with Did he?
[01:03:17.343 --> 01:03:42.989]  Just like Jeffrey Epstein blackmailing politicians and religious leaders and others with hidden cameras and that the FBI went in to take this over to cover for him and that's why he's so calm and arrogant out in public laughing it off because just like they use the FBI to cover up the Epstein files and all the video hard drives he has from Zorro Ranch and his facility in New York and his facility in Paris and his facility at Little St.
[01:03:43.049 --> 01:03:43.889]  John's in the Caribbean.
[01:03:45.097 --> 01:03:54.159]  So going back to the days of the head of the FBI, Hoover, they have been doing this en masse.
[01:03:54.939 --> 01:04:04.401]  But when they have an Alex Jones or a Senator Paul, or people like ourselves, they can never get anything because we don't go around at sex parties and get videotaped.
[01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:09.542]  What we're doing is playing water volleyball in the backyard and grilling a steak.
[01:04:09.822 --> 01:04:10.602]  That never gets old.
[01:04:11.142 --> 01:04:18.138]   But certain people, and folks who are part of the Hollywood orbit, Also get into this whole music orbit that's just as important.
[01:04:18.838 --> 01:04:24.722]  So it's clear that this whole thing is a Jeffrey Epstein operation.
[01:04:25.122 --> 01:04:29.425]  And as I've told you hundreds of times, Epstein is just one of these operations.
[01:04:29.445 --> 01:04:31.606]  There are hundreds in the United States going on.
[01:04:31.626 --> 01:04:34.688]  I have had people try to get me in these things.
[01:04:36.609 --> 01:04:38.150]  I've been very, very honest about that.
[01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:39.811]  I never obviously took part in it.
[01:04:40.471 --> 01:04:43.033]  But this is standard operating procedure.
[01:04:44.398 --> 01:04:54.603]  And the parties that I was at in Los Angeles 20 years ago, 15 years ago, to the point of I never even went anymore was, hey, you want to really get big roles and you really want to be in the end club.
[01:04:54.623 --> 01:04:59.285]  You know, you're, uh, you want to go to this party?
[01:04:59.305 --> 01:05:00.645]  That's going to be pretty wild.
[01:05:02.426 --> 01:05:04.627]  And I'm like, well, no, I'm, I'm married.
[01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:05.187]  I don't want to do that.
[01:05:05.207 --> 01:05:06.288]  Well, then you, yeah, you shouldn't go.
[01:05:07.428 --> 01:05:08.509]  And I go, well, what, what goes on?
[01:05:08.589 --> 01:05:10.330]  Well, you know, drugs and stuff like that.
[01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:13.279]   And, you know, Who knows what you might see.
[01:05:13.399 --> 01:05:19.245]  And then once I was at a party and like a hundred people at it, including top stars.
[01:05:21.287 --> 01:05:26.472]  And here come in these girls that look like they're 15, 16, all very beautiful, but you know, underage.
[01:05:27.493 --> 01:05:31.417]  And one of the fellows that was there said, Hey, yeah, you might want to get out of here.
[01:05:32.598 --> 01:05:33.218]  And he's like, let's go.
[01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:41.485]  So this is everywhere and I've had musicians on that if the same things happen to them and they witnessed it, including satanic rituals.
[01:05:41.545 --> 01:05:45.207]  So we're going to air this report and then go to our special guest for the balance of the hour.
[01:05:46.207 --> 01:05:49.128]  And then we have a huge guest coming on on the economy.
[01:05:51.141 --> 01:06:04.587]  Peter Schiff in the third hour today, but here is the Patrick McDavid clip with some added video of Bohemian Grove and Skull & Bones and other things, because those are the original operations where this is going on.
[01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:04.927]  Here it is.
[01:06:06.016 --> 01:06:06.316]  Diddy.
[01:06:06.717 --> 01:06:06.897]  Yeah.
[01:06:07.037 --> 01:06:09.859]  There's a lot of crazy things that's going on with this story Diddy, right?
[01:06:09.879 --> 01:06:15.542]  I mean, a lot of people are calling him the Epstein of the music, the Hollywood world, you know, the entertainment world.
[01:06:15.622 --> 01:06:17.884]  I read this story and I want to kind of get your thoughts on this here.
[01:06:18.244 --> 01:06:18.984]  So here's a story.
[01:06:19.224 --> 01:06:26.249]  Sean Diddy Combs, former bodyguard, claims music mogul had tapes of politicians and princes out there.
[01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:28.150]  And we'll play this clip in a minute.
[01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:41.158]   Gene Deal, who was present the night before Notorious Biaji Biggie was fatally shot in 1997, made the sensational comments during an interview with Art of Dialogue YouTube channel, and here's what he had to say.
[01:06:41.178 --> 01:06:41.878]  Go for it, Rob.
[01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:44.880]  After finding out he was recording everything.
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:51.284]  But not only celebrities, not only celebrities, I don't think it's only celebrities gonna be shook.
[01:06:51.864 --> 01:06:54.566]  He had politicians in there.
[01:06:55.686 --> 01:06:58.128]  He had princes in there.
[01:06:58.448 --> 01:06:58.648]  Uh-oh.
[01:06:59.719 --> 01:07:02.925]  He also had a couple of preachers in there.
[01:07:03.065 --> 01:07:03.546]  Oh, damn.
[01:07:04.327 --> 01:07:06.170]  Is he talking about who I think he's talking about?
[01:07:06.671 --> 01:07:07.172]  Uh, you think?
[01:07:08.192 --> 01:07:08.432]  Is he?
[01:07:08.492 --> 01:07:09.253]  Hallelujah!
[01:07:09.453 --> 01:07:10.754]  Kat Williams commented on that.
[01:07:10.774 --> 01:07:12.456]  Kat Williams definitely brought him on, a preacher.
[01:07:12.836 --> 01:07:14.458]  Yeah, you know what preacher that is.
[01:07:14.618 --> 01:07:14.958]  I don't.
[01:07:15.819 --> 01:07:23.425]  Okay, well, you don't know the preacher that was seen with Diddy at one of the parties that Kat Williams says, I don't care whether you're T.D.
[01:07:23.465 --> 01:07:24.626]  Jakes or Diddy.
[01:07:24.867 --> 01:07:27.469]  Oh yeah, he was the truth coming out in 2024.
[01:07:27.629 --> 01:07:30.712]  Listen, again, this is allegedly, that's what he's saying.
[01:07:31.352 --> 01:07:32.673]  Your thoughts on this story here?
[01:07:32.853 --> 01:07:34.775]  So it wasn't just this guy that was saying it.
[01:07:34.815 --> 01:07:42.401]  Lil Rod, the former producer, filed the lawsuit and he said every room in Diddy's mansions were wired with cameras.
[01:07:43.182 --> 01:07:49.767]  And he had some of the footage, he had some of the pictures, and he displayed those in the lawsuit that came out.
[01:07:49.787 --> 01:07:52.189]  And this was used for blackmail material.
[01:07:52.670 --> 01:08:07.283]   They bring in these people, a lot of these people were also Aspiring young artists in the music industry, and then these parties were sponsored by Motown Records CEO, Universal Records CEO, this goes all the way to the top.
[01:08:07.823 --> 01:08:17.692]  And so you get these people in compromising situations, the drinks were laced, the videotapes were hot, and then at the end of the day, you wake up the next morning, what did I do?
[01:08:18.579 --> 01:08:20.622]  And then they have compromising material on you.
[01:08:21.002 --> 01:08:22.564]  And then they can guide your career.
[01:08:22.845 --> 01:08:23.986]  They could kill your career.
[01:08:24.326 --> 01:08:25.067]  But they got you.
[01:08:25.608 --> 01:08:27.430]  And it wasn't just people in the music business.
[01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:31.996]  As you said, there were athletes, there were celebrities, there were politicians, people from the royal family.
[01:08:32.517 --> 01:08:37.062]  And we were also told by the former bodyguard that Diddy was an FBI informant.
[01:08:37.803 --> 01:08:41.787]  So he was a snitch and was feeding information to the Feds.
[01:08:42.607 --> 01:08:44.449]  And we don't know what that means.
[01:08:44.489 --> 01:08:45.690]  We haven't been able to confirm it.
[01:08:45.730 --> 01:08:48.893]  But even Little Rod said it's not just like Epstein.
[01:08:48.993 --> 01:08:51.455]  It could be worse than Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:08:51.975 --> 01:08:52.936]  Now let me ask you this.
[01:08:52.996 --> 01:09:03.905]   When you're when you're seeing something like that, do you think You know how somebody is making money for you, you can't lose them because they're still making money for you, right?
[01:09:03.965 --> 01:09:10.851]  So, for example, like an athlete, LeBron James, he's still getting a lot of endorsements, he's still making a lot of money.
[01:09:10.911 --> 01:09:13.793]  You gotta make sure you protect that asset because that guy's making you a lot of money.
[01:09:15.422 --> 01:09:19.243]  I think the number one person right now that you have to protect in music is Taylor Swift.
[01:09:19.263 --> 01:09:20.264]  You have to protect her.
[01:09:20.844 --> 01:09:22.144]  It's a big insurance policy.
[01:09:22.184 --> 01:09:22.624]  She's young.
[01:09:22.644 --> 01:09:24.425]  She's going to be around for a long time to come.
[01:09:24.825 --> 01:09:28.026]  The concerts, the money-making, the $5 billion, the tours, all that stuff.
[01:09:28.526 --> 01:09:33.827]  Nothing can go wrong with her because if God forbid something happens, you're making money off of her.
[01:09:33.847 --> 01:09:36.288]  You don't take Taylor to a ditty party.
[01:09:37.368 --> 01:09:40.169]  You don't go anywhere near a freak-off party.
[01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.589]  That's right.
[01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:41.630]  So here's where I'm going with this.
[01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:47.152]   Do you think Diddy's at a phase that, how do you make money off Diddy today?
[01:09:47.192 --> 01:09:48.593]  Because what's Diddy doing today?
[01:09:48.613 --> 01:09:49.554]  He's not performing.
[01:09:50.155 --> 01:09:56.962]  So is it more that you protect Diddy because the people that he knows that he can destroy their lives that you kind of like have to keep them quiet?
[01:09:57.483 --> 01:10:01.467]  Or do you have to find a way to eliminate him kind of like they try to eliminate this guy named Jeffrey?
[01:10:02.373 --> 01:10:08.555]  I don't know if he was being eliminated by the FBI or even by the Universal Records executives.
[01:10:09.076 --> 01:10:11.397]  What happened was Cassie filed this lawsuit.
[01:10:11.437 --> 01:10:13.177]  He settled in about 48 hours.
[01:10:13.517 --> 01:10:13.977]  Very fast.
[01:10:13.997 --> 01:10:16.218]  So then everybody goes, oh, did he settling?
[01:10:16.458 --> 01:10:17.079]  Yeah.
[01:10:17.259 --> 01:10:18.519]  So everybody starts filing.
[01:10:18.619 --> 01:10:22.301]  And so Lil Rod files some real graphic, nasty stuff.
[01:10:22.341 --> 01:10:29.884]   We're talking minors, sex trafficking, ecstasy and the alcohol, and then All hell blows loose.
[01:10:30.124 --> 01:10:31.865]  And that's when the feds come in and raid.
[01:10:32.426 --> 01:10:35.728]  And they go right to the camera system and pull all the servers out.
[01:10:36.529 --> 01:10:38.891]  And they, I believe, arrested the drug mule.
[01:10:39.471 --> 01:10:41.052]  And so, they're closing in.
[01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:42.013]  They're going to build a case.
[01:10:42.874 --> 01:10:44.395]  And, look.
[01:10:45.115 --> 01:10:48.639]  Is this something that's coming down at the highest level?
[01:10:48.799 --> 01:10:53.945]  I have no idea, but I know Diddy's life is about to blow up, and there's really no way to get out of this.
[01:10:54.025 --> 01:10:59.711]  And I want to say this, and Vinny, I want to go to you, because Ashton Kutcher is seen as he prepares to be subpoenaed on Diddy's case.
[01:10:59.771 --> 01:11:00.191]  That's one.
[01:11:00.231 --> 01:11:00.672]  Next one.
[01:11:00.712 --> 01:11:02.374]  Sean Diddy comes ex-Cassie.
[01:11:02.974 --> 01:11:09.579]  That he paid off, I think, 30 million bucks, whatever the number is, cooperating with federal investigations amid the sex trafficking probe.
[01:11:10.019 --> 01:11:10.480]  That's bad.
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.921]  That's very bad, right?
[01:11:11.941 --> 01:11:12.201]  That's bad.
[01:11:12.521 --> 01:11:13.141]  So, next one.
[01:11:13.182 --> 01:11:16.404]  Sean Diddy Combs still continues carefree in Miami.
[01:11:16.444 --> 01:11:17.765]  This is a story from yesterday.
[01:11:17.785 --> 01:11:17.965]  Yep.
[01:11:18.305 --> 01:11:22.148]  Lifestyle by smoking and drinking after federal raids.
[01:11:22.568 --> 01:11:25.851]  Sean Diddy Combs, youngest son, Christian King, 25, is now sued.
[01:11:25.911 --> 01:11:30.194]  So, it's like, if it isn't one thing, it's another thing constantly popping up.
[01:11:30.754 --> 01:11:37.175]  But Jesse, from my point of view though, he's in Miami, he's riding bikes, he's taking photos, he seems as if he doesn't have a care in the world.
[01:11:37.255 --> 01:11:52.558]  To me, somebody from the outside looking in, it seems like they're like, hey listen, especially with the Cassidy thing, that thing blew the top off of everything, we have to go in there, you don't be there, we're going to make the play, we're going to grab all the footage and everything, I think people are going to fall, nothing is going to happen to him.
[01:11:52.598 --> 01:12:01.902]   He's going to be protected, but they've been using Diddy for how long, Jesse, from the politician So back in 2004, he launched Vote or Die.
[01:12:02.302 --> 01:12:07.444]  So he was for Kerry, then he was for Obama, then it was for Hillary, and then he's for Biden.
[01:12:07.464 --> 01:12:13.528]  So he has been the community organizer for the Democratic Party in the streets for about 20 years.
[01:12:13.548 --> 01:12:14.708]  He's a valuable asset.
[01:12:14.788 --> 01:12:15.229]  Big time.
[01:12:15.589 --> 01:12:16.229]  Big time.
[01:12:16.289 --> 01:12:20.491]  And they gave, like, he started a revolt through Maxine Waters.
[01:12:20.531 --> 01:12:22.973]  Gave him a cut in order for that merger to go through.
[01:12:23.593 --> 01:12:25.695]  She said, my guy has to get a piece of the pie.
[01:12:25.895 --> 01:12:29.418]  So if you think about it, he's obviously in with these higher-up politicians.
[01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:36.763]  You're in there recording all these people having all this dirt, like they say, with Epstein was working for Mossad, or God knows who he was working for.
[01:12:37.304 --> 01:12:38.805]  Who knows who did he work for?
[01:12:39.045 --> 01:12:45.610]  He's not recording all these people, all these princes, just to have footage for when he's older to show to his kids.
[01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:52.195]  This is a coordinated thing, and I think the Cassie thing blew the top off, and now they're like, we have to go in and make sure nothing is incriminating.
[01:12:52.635 --> 01:12:53.836]  For us, or else he does.
[01:12:53.856 --> 01:12:58.659]  Right, because when they went in and raided Epstein's mansions, we never saw any of that footage.
[01:12:58.679 --> 01:12:59.259]  Not one minute.
[01:12:59.319 --> 01:13:01.100]  Only Ghislaine Maxwell went down.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:01.540]  Bingo.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:05.603]  They never got anybody else, and he had tapes in Little St.
[01:13:05.643 --> 01:13:10.426]  James, he had tapes in the Upper East Side, he had tapes in New Mexico, in Palm Beach.
[01:13:11.126 --> 01:13:13.227]  We never heard anything else about them.
[01:13:13.287 --> 01:13:13.748]  Exactly.
[01:13:14.068 --> 01:13:17.090]  Jesse, you said something a little bit earlier that I was like, whoa.
[01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:19.871]  Because he's been called the Black Epstein.
[01:13:20.111 --> 01:13:20.311]  Yeah.
[01:13:20.391 --> 01:13:27.513]  You said earlier that this could even be worse than Epstein.
[01:13:27.693 --> 01:13:29.254]  Everybody sounds like Alex Jones now.
[01:13:29.274 --> 01:13:31.674]  I've been telling you this for 25 years at least, been on air 30.
[01:13:31.794 --> 01:13:41.678]  It's going on everywhere, but the Democratic Party are the kingpins of this and it's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:13:43.738 --> 01:13:44.158]  It came out in 2016.
[01:13:47.006 --> 01:14:00.570]  The Democratic Party isn't just having kids as young as seven delivered to sex parties for their entertainment in the hot tub in upstate New York and other places, but they're doing Alistair Crowley rituals.
[01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:01.990]  Notice none of that got any coverage.
[01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.611]  That's in there.
[01:14:04.271 --> 01:14:08.152]  They'd divert off to a pizza place and try to get everybody to cover that because nothing was going on there.
[01:14:08.572 --> 01:14:09.933]  But they would ignore all the real stuff.
[01:14:09.973 --> 01:14:11.233]  This is the full horror.
[01:14:11.293 --> 01:14:14.014]  Now, the Republicans have Bohemian Grove.
[01:14:15.649 --> 01:14:17.790]  And Skull and Bones where they sexually compromise.
[01:14:18.450 --> 01:14:21.551]  But for a Republican, homosexuality is the big bad thing.
[01:14:21.911 --> 01:14:23.432]  So it's men on men.
[01:14:23.932 --> 01:14:25.892]  And they compromise them.
[01:14:25.952 --> 01:14:30.354]  I think it's immoral, but it's a different ballpark than children.
[01:14:30.934 --> 01:14:35.275]  And the Republicans have been caught some with children, but nine times out of ten, it's Democrats.
[01:14:35.315 --> 01:14:36.576]  They are the nastiest.
[01:14:36.616 --> 01:14:37.436]  They are the worst.
[01:14:37.936 --> 01:14:39.817]  They're the worst house in a bad neighborhood.
[01:14:41.425 --> 01:14:43.886]  So we're going to post this report up on X. It needs to go viral.
[01:14:43.926 --> 01:14:46.048]  Great job to Patrick McDavid and Jesse Watters.
[01:14:46.908 --> 01:14:52.992]  I watched the entire interview last night and just Patrick McDavid is doing a fabulous job.
[01:14:53.152 --> 01:14:53.852]  So is Jesse Watters.
[01:14:54.452 --> 01:14:54.773]  All right.
[01:14:55.633 --> 01:15:00.716]  Now shifting gears to balance the hour and I really appreciate him coming on with us is Alan Dos Santos.
[01:15:01.937 --> 01:15:09.381]  And he is one of the leading journalists in Brazil, but now he's had to be exiled here to the United States.
[01:15:10.686 --> 01:15:11.707]  And this is a big deal.
[01:15:12.228 --> 01:15:22.539]  When I explain that whether you're in Australia or Germany or Brazil, you're all facing the same big black rock CIA, Mossad, MI6, New World Order system.
[01:15:23.079 --> 01:15:26.363]  And I told you this two years ago, they're using the State Department against Bolsonaro.
[01:15:26.904 --> 01:15:28.685]  And now that came out with documents a week ago.
[01:15:29.619 --> 01:15:30.500]  But they admitted they were.
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:31.881]  But now the documents are public.
[01:15:32.381 --> 01:15:34.122]  And so they're arresting people en masse.
[01:15:34.142 --> 01:15:35.784]  They're arresting people that don't take shots.
[01:15:36.244 --> 01:15:37.705]  The CPS is taking their children.
[01:15:37.745 --> 01:15:39.907]  They've taken Bolsonaro off the ballot for eight years.
[01:15:40.487 --> 01:15:42.669]  This dictator judge.
[01:15:42.689 --> 01:15:44.730]  If they had the Supreme Court, we'd be on the same system.
[01:15:45.371 --> 01:15:47.412]  So this is a window into where they want to take us.
[01:15:47.432 --> 01:15:49.434]  And now there's hearings coming up early next month.
[01:15:49.474 --> 01:15:50.375]  We'll cover them live.
[01:15:50.675 --> 01:15:51.696]  Helen Avidson, reporters.
[01:15:53.169 --> 01:15:57.393]  Of Elon Musk in Congress, bringing up how huge this is and calling it out.
[01:15:57.693 --> 01:16:00.356]  He also has the EU coming after him, Sibley and Kremlin to shut him down.
[01:16:00.696 --> 01:16:03.278]  So say what you want about Elon Musk, he is the man in the arena.
[01:16:04.019 --> 01:16:09.924]  And I'm reaching tens of millions of people extra a day conservatively, thanks to Elon Musk, and I'm not being censored at all.
[01:16:10.204 --> 01:16:11.466]  So I don't look a gift horse in the mouth.
[01:16:12.438 --> 01:16:15.741]  This is very, very exciting times right now.
[01:16:15.841 --> 01:16:21.325]  And the real game changer is Elon Musk and other reporters that he is sheltering.
[01:16:21.685 --> 01:16:26.109]  They're coming after Elon Musk civilly and criminally now in Brazil for what he has done.
[01:16:26.629 --> 01:16:31.433]  And so Alan dos Santos, the two saints, joins us now.
[01:16:31.453 --> 01:16:32.674]  I'm going to try to shut up.
[01:16:32.734 --> 01:16:33.675]  We've got six minutes to break.
[01:16:33.695 --> 01:16:39.019]  We've got 30 minutes after that coming up to try to really give you the floor, because this is so important for everybody.
[01:16:39.039 --> 01:16:39.700]  But thank you.
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:43.842]  So, Elon, unfroze your account, has really pushed what you've said.
[01:16:43.862 --> 01:16:58.708]  You and a couple other reporters from Brazil have put this front and center worldwide to expose this international network run by the criminals that have hijacked America to not just block and seal elections here, but do it all over the world, which is the CIA specialty.
[01:16:58.728 --> 01:17:01.449]  But instead of an armed coup, they're doing it through the courts.
[01:17:01.509 --> 01:17:04.490]  So, Mr. Dos Santos, thank you so much for coming on.
[01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:08.231]  Thank you so much for having me here.
[01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:08.991]  For me, it's an honor.
[01:17:09.351 --> 01:17:18.198]  I started Terça Livre in Brazil, inspired by you and InfoWars, and this is what is happening in Brazil.
[01:17:18.518 --> 01:17:34.539]   Once we created an independent media called Terça Livre, I'm the founder of it, we have been beating All the media outlets live, as you used to do and still do nowadays.
[01:17:35.139 --> 01:17:46.687]  So once the media is afraid to lose their reign, you know, like their kingdom, they really want to destroy you in any way they can.
[01:17:47.427 --> 01:17:50.610]  Once they couldn't, they went to the judiciary.
[01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:53.972]  And this is happening in the United States right now.
[01:17:54.725 --> 01:18:15.974]  Once they cannot beat you through the media, they cannot beat you through the election, like what happened in 2016 in the United States and like what happened in 2018 with Bolsonaro, they start doing fraud elections and starting asking for judiciary to take a place into this war.
[01:18:16.986 --> 01:18:24.931]  And one thing that still did not happen in the United States is when the communists, they packed the Supreme Court.
[01:18:25.432 --> 01:18:27.233]  So they did it in Brazil.
[01:18:27.813 --> 01:18:34.938]  The Supreme Court right now in Brazil, the Federal Supreme Court in Brazil, they are packed by communist judges.
[01:18:35.919 --> 01:18:40.542]  And one of them is openly saying that he's a communist, Flavio Gino, for example.
[01:18:41.362 --> 01:18:56.981]   So all of them went to censorship people because they know That through communication, you can reach people hard, you know, like you can really be in touch with your audience and they will, they will know the truth.
[01:18:57.882 --> 01:19:09.045]  I exposed a suitcase in Brazil that was doing wiretapping and that suitcase was inside the China embassy and also North Korea embassy.
[01:19:10.009 --> 01:19:14.390]  I broke this story when I was already out of Brazil.
[01:19:14.911 --> 01:19:21.453]  And after that, Alexandre de Moraes ordered my arrest and extradition.
[01:19:22.253 --> 01:19:27.635]  But I was already in the United States, took over a United States election to make my company grow.
[01:19:27.655 --> 01:19:34.837]  You know, I just would like to make Tercelivia available in English too, but I couldn't have any chance to do that.
[01:19:35.416 --> 01:19:41.179]  They raided my house twice before it happened, and I knew they would come after me.
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:45.322]  But I know the United States Constitution could protect my rights.
[01:19:46.162 --> 01:19:48.124]  And let us be honest, it's not my right.
[01:19:48.184 --> 01:19:49.184]  It's God-given rights.
[01:19:49.664 --> 01:19:53.827]  And this is the only one country that respects the God-given rights, Mr. Jones.
[01:19:55.578 --> 01:19:56.499]  And that's what's incredible.
[01:19:56.659 --> 01:19:58.941]  America is the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[01:19:58.981 --> 01:20:00.963]  People that haven't been around the world don't appreciate it.
[01:20:00.983 --> 01:20:02.324]  And they're trying to take it here.
[01:20:02.344 --> 01:20:09.191]  And that's why Elon's so important with Brazil and the EU trying to come in and make him control what he does in America.
[01:20:09.231 --> 01:20:10.072]  That is so dangerous.
[01:20:11.727 --> 01:20:12.047]  It is!
[01:20:12.307 --> 01:20:25.217]  It is because the United States Constitution is the only one in the world that really defends the republic, defends with the people power, not the bureaucratic power.
[01:20:25.697 --> 01:20:28.079]  There's no other constitution in the world that does that.
[01:20:28.859 --> 01:20:35.772]   I stayed three years and a half A part of my family waiting for my wife and kids.
[01:20:36.512 --> 01:20:40.495]  And I would like to emphasize I have one daughter who is special.
[01:20:40.935 --> 01:20:42.216]  She has West syndrome.
[01:20:43.757 --> 01:20:54.305]  And I couldn't send money to help her because Alexandre de Moraes froze my assets in Brazil and froze the assets of my company as well.
[01:20:55.143 --> 01:20:59.044]  Just because I was doing my job as a journalist.
[01:20:59.904 --> 01:21:02.265]  Unmasking what they did in Brazil.
[01:21:02.685 --> 01:21:03.665]  Secret meetings.
[01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:05.366]  Wiretapping.
[01:21:05.406 --> 01:21:06.666]  And by the way, we're about to go to break.
[01:21:06.686 --> 01:21:07.906]  We're putting images of him.
[01:21:07.946 --> 01:21:09.287]  He's totally unselfaware.
[01:21:09.667 --> 01:21:10.867]  He looks like Nosferatu.
[01:21:11.247 --> 01:21:14.068]  Who would run around in front of the camera swishing a black cape?
[01:21:14.728 --> 01:21:16.349]  I mean, the guy looks like a total clown.
[01:21:16.409 --> 01:21:17.429]  He looks evil.
[01:21:17.489 --> 01:21:18.989]  I mean, he doesn't just do evil.
[01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:20.730]  He looks like a cartoon villain.
[01:21:22.150 --> 01:21:23.431]  He's precisely a psycho.
[01:21:23.972 --> 01:21:26.814]  And I'm not using any words to describe it.
[01:21:27.034 --> 01:21:29.576]  It's a clinical description.
[01:21:29.836 --> 01:21:31.017]  He's really a psychopath.
[01:21:31.658 --> 01:21:34.260]  He doesn't care what happened with people's lives.
[01:21:34.981 --> 01:21:38.784]  And there was a guy who died in prison after January 8th.
[01:21:39.724 --> 01:21:46.470]  And the prosecutors were against his arrest and also asking for medical help.
[01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:50.153]  And he didn't, I mean, he didn't answer to that.
[01:21:50.513 --> 01:21:51.214]  And that guy died.
[01:21:52.608 --> 01:21:53.748]  So he's a psychopath.
[01:21:53.948 --> 01:22:06.611]  He's not a regular normal person that believes in something different than you and I. And is it fair to say even more than Lula, he's basically the dictator right now taking people off the ballot of Brazil?
[01:22:08.391 --> 01:22:10.252]  Yeah, I would say that too.
[01:22:11.072 --> 01:22:27.114]   Because he right now has the power that nobody can, how can I put it that in English, I would tell you, if the government does something, we still have tools, like impeachment process, we'll have the Congress that can fight back.
[01:22:27.134 --> 01:22:27.894]  Hold on, stay there!
[01:22:28.094 --> 01:22:29.575]  Alan Dos Santos, right there.
[01:22:29.595 --> 01:22:30.395]  Repeat that thought.
[01:22:30.735 --> 01:22:31.835]  We'll be back in just a few minutes.
[01:22:31.955 --> 01:22:32.415]  Amazing.
[01:22:32.715 --> 01:22:35.496]  I want to do a two-hour special with you and other journalists.
[01:22:35.576 --> 01:22:36.056]  We'll be right back.
[01:22:36.437 --> 01:22:39.958]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[01:22:40.338 --> 01:22:47.320]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of, is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:49.541]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[01:22:49.721 --> 01:22:50.781]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[01:22:50.801 --> 01:22:51.541]  He loved the idea.
[01:22:51.841 --> 01:22:55.363]  What would you call the debates and discussions about a pro-human future?
[01:22:55.403 --> 01:22:56.263]  Just Team Humanity?
[01:22:56.323 --> 01:22:57.223]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[01:22:57.363 --> 01:22:57.804]  Absolutely.
[01:22:58.144 --> 01:22:59.504]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[01:22:59.584 --> 01:23:03.005]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[01:23:03.265 --> 01:23:10.688]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[01:23:10.968 --> 01:23:22.699]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[01:23:22.979 --> 01:23:24.300]  We're told humans are the problem.
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.321]  We're told we're killing the earth.
[01:23:25.581 --> 01:23:29.865]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[01:23:30.165 --> 01:23:30.866]  We're not going to do that.
[01:23:31.126 --> 01:23:35.770]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[01:23:37.632 --> 01:23:44.277]  Exiled journalist from Brazil, Alan Dos Santos is our guest live.
[01:23:48.741 --> 01:24:00.911]  One of the things you've been talking about on your show is your allegation that government officials are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking, and the grooming of children, right?
[01:24:00.911 --> 01:24:04.110]   What do you mean like what Jeffrey Epstein did with the Clintons?
[01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:06.110]  OH MY GOD!
[01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:08.110]  That was a huge shot!
[01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:12.350]  That double whammy!
[01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:14.350]  That was the right hand!
[01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:16.350]  Oh my goodness!
[01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:18.350]  My goodness!
[01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:20.350]  It's ridiculous!
[01:24:20.350 --> 01:24:22.350]  [Music]
[01:24:22.350 --> 01:24:24.350]  [Music]
[01:24:24.933 --> 01:24:26.034]  Whole Epstein operation.
[01:24:26.214 --> 01:24:26.774]  Run by the FBI.
[01:24:26.874 --> 01:24:27.595]  It's all coming out.
[01:24:29.833 --> 01:24:32.755]  And I literally went through two show trials where I was already found guilty.
[01:24:33.275 --> 01:24:34.436]  They acted like they had a trial.
[01:24:34.496 --> 01:24:38.278]  It was cameras, putting makeup on, all of it staged.
[01:24:38.358 --> 01:24:39.999]  My defense attorneys couldn't defend me.
[01:24:40.259 --> 01:24:41.040]  I was already guilty.
[01:24:43.999 --> 01:24:44.980]  I've been the model of this.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.241]  Now you see what's happening to Trump.
[01:24:46.261 --> 01:24:48.364]  You've seen what's happened to Bolsonaro in Brazil.
[01:24:48.804 --> 01:24:49.965]  And now it's expanding.
[01:24:50.546 --> 01:24:54.450]  Now in Ireland they're saying they're going to arrest people that try to run for office that are popular.
[01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:57.113]  Now they're appointing mayors and appointing first ministers.
[01:24:58.214 --> 01:25:06.523]  Alan Dos Santos will put up your ex-account for people to be sure and follow you on screen for TV viewers right now.
[01:25:08.323 --> 01:25:09.444]  You got interrupted by the break.
[01:25:09.484 --> 01:25:20.656]  As I said, who's more powerful, Lula, the criminal communist, who clearly stole the election from Bolsonaro, or is it this judge that's doing all of this?
[01:25:20.676 --> 01:25:24.800]  You were saying you agree that basically he's some sort of dictator.
[01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:25.681]  You got caught up on the break.
[01:25:25.721 --> 01:25:26.102]  Start over.
[01:25:27.608 --> 01:25:33.952]  Yeah, so just to explain the middle finger in the picture, this is the Supreme Court building in my back.
[01:25:34.572 --> 01:25:36.653]  I took that picture when they raided my house.
[01:25:37.233 --> 01:25:44.658]  So that's my physical answer for them because they need to understand they are not the last words.
[01:25:45.358 --> 01:25:58.007]   So I was telling you that and somehow Demarais is more dangerous than Lula right now because once A decision is made inside the Supreme Court.
[01:25:58.627 --> 01:26:00.109]  Who else can you appeal to?
[01:26:00.789 --> 01:26:01.971]  So that's a problem right now.
[01:26:02.872 --> 01:26:08.037]  And this is, I see that that's coming in the United States.
[01:26:08.217 --> 01:26:13.122]  And that's the definition of dictatorship is when one group can do anything they want unchecked.
[01:26:14.426 --> 01:26:15.407]  Yes, exactly.
[01:26:15.608 --> 01:26:23.098]  Because the judicial power somehow can, you know, they can pretend they are just following the law.
[01:26:23.418 --> 01:26:29.006]  They can pretend they are just ruling the country, but not ruling the country because they are just following the law.
[01:26:29.686 --> 01:26:32.367]  This is the most dangerous thing that can happen in the United States.
[01:26:32.587 --> 01:26:36.067]  Once they can pack the Supreme Court, it's over.
[01:26:36.087 --> 01:26:38.948]  I mean, what else you can do?
[01:26:38.968 --> 01:26:44.329]  In the United States, you still have tools, like the Second Amendment, to protect the First Amendment.
[01:26:44.609 --> 01:26:45.849]  But in Brazil, we can't.
[01:26:46.069 --> 01:26:46.769]  We can't do that.
[01:26:47.109 --> 01:26:47.889]  And they know it.
[01:26:48.269 --> 01:26:56.571]  They know that we can't go along with them in this war because the Supreme Court is the dictator power right now in Brazil.
[01:26:57.131 --> 01:27:01.912]  This is why he put Elon Musk as CEO of X and it's a lie.
[01:27:02.133 --> 01:27:05.053]  So in Murad's decision, there's fake news.
[01:27:05.554 --> 01:27:06.274]  But he doesn't care.
[01:27:07.014 --> 01:27:10.235]  He said Elon Musk is the CEO of X, but he isn't.
[01:27:10.735 --> 01:27:13.796]  So he put Elon Musk in the same inquiry I am at.
[01:27:14.545 --> 01:27:20.247]  And he invaded my house based on lies, as he did against Elon Musk.
[01:27:20.567 --> 01:27:34.053]  But now Elon has a chance to say to the world in the Congress beginning of next month if he was committing a crime following unlawful orders in Brazil or not.
[01:27:34.253 --> 01:27:34.913]  But guess what?
[01:27:36.026 --> 01:27:37.168]  Elon Musk didn't do that.
[01:27:37.448 --> 01:27:39.270]  He deplatformed me.
[01:27:40.691 --> 01:27:42.373]  Sorry, let's put that correct.
[01:27:42.593 --> 01:27:44.194]  Twitter deplatformed me.
[01:27:44.795 --> 01:27:53.203]  And now Elon Musk reinstates me on X. Doing it outside of Brazil, he's not breaking any Brazil law.
[01:27:53.704 --> 01:27:58.709]  So the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Brazil is inside Brazil, not outside of Brazil.
[01:28:00.939 --> 01:28:14.207]   Meta and Google still keep all my accounts blocked and Elon Musk said the Supreme Court is asking me to block people but not saying It was a Supreme Court decision.
[01:28:14.588 --> 01:28:15.248]  Elon said that.
[01:28:15.388 --> 01:28:16.870]  This is on Twitter Files.
[01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:31.021]  The biggest YouTuber in Brazil, Felipe Neto, he was hunting me to put my account down, asking the same guy that de-platformed Donald Trump to de-platform me because I'm the Alan dos Santos of Brazil.
[01:28:31.061 --> 01:28:33.903]  That's what it's written on the Twitter Files.
[01:28:35.034 --> 01:28:37.016]  So they know how dangerous the truth is.
[01:28:37.716 --> 01:28:43.080]  And they know that doing that through the judiciary is a totally different game.
[01:28:43.341 --> 01:28:48.185]  So this is the kind of question I would like to make for Elon Musk and everyone.
[01:28:48.665 --> 01:28:59.474]  Because once he reversed that decision, is Meta and Google doing the crime to censor me outside of Brazil?
[01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:04.864]  That's the question, because Brazilian jurisdiction, it's not outside of Brazil.
[01:29:05.285 --> 01:29:06.986]  It's just inside my country.
[01:29:07.046 --> 01:29:08.447]  And again, let's expand on this.
[01:29:09.346 --> 01:29:16.265]   Australia had three senators last week that I know of I guess more did it too. I'm told call for Elon Musk arrest
[01:29:16.265 --> 01:29:22.025]   including the premier of Australia
[01:29:22.025 --> 01:29:28.525]   Calling for his arrest for allowing people to put clown hair on him
[01:29:28.525 --> 01:29:31.905]   You're a public figure people are gonna put clown hair on you
[01:29:31.905 --> 01:29:36.025]   I think it's funny they do it to me, but imagine how out of touch they are but but
[01:29:36.586 --> 01:29:40.865]   If it wasn't for Musk, and he's double the size of Twitter since he took it over his ex
[01:29:40.865 --> 01:29:45.346]   They are in full panic mode and and and this is a model for the world
[01:29:45.451 --> 01:29:48.613]  People think, oh, they'll never censor us, that's because in America we're used to having some freedom.
[01:29:48.954 --> 01:29:54.658]  No, already all the other big channels, all other big tech blocks me, okay?
[01:29:54.918 --> 01:30:00.002]  And then once they block you, they can lie about you and make up lies and steal your identity, and you can't...
[01:30:01.132 --> 01:30:01.952]  Defend yourself.
[01:30:02.012 --> 01:30:08.576]  So whether you're in Australia or Brazil or Germany, they're all coming after Musk, folks, because they're coming after you.
[01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:12.298]  Here's a short clip of one of the senators calling for Elon Musk arrest.
[01:30:12.318 --> 01:30:12.638]  Here it is.
[01:30:13.382 --> 01:30:16.004]  Elon Musk has no social conscience or conscience whatsoever.
[01:30:16.365 --> 01:30:20.008]  I don't know, whatever Elon Musk is on, it says that that's okay.
[01:30:20.268 --> 01:30:23.030]  To continue to air that is absolutely disgusting behaviour.
[01:30:23.471 --> 01:30:25.312]  And quite frankly, the bloke should be jailed.
[01:30:25.612 --> 01:30:33.519]  And the sooner that we can bring rules in or do something about this sort of game playing with our social media, the better off we're going to be.
[01:30:33.539 --> 01:30:39.484]  But quite frankly, the power that that man has, because of that platform that he's on, it's got to stop.
[01:30:39.564 --> 01:30:41.426]  It has absolutely got to stop.
[01:30:42.167 --> 01:30:48.321]  So let's be clear, this is something really important folks, so listen to me carefully and I want to get our guest Alan Dos Santos' take on it.
[01:30:49.986 --> 01:30:53.407]  The UN was supposedly a world government, and it's tyrannical, we know that, and communist.
[01:30:53.907 --> 01:31:06.051]  But really, Big Tech's the global government, because if they adopt the Chinese communist standards like they've done, and if they adopt Brazilian standards under communist Lula, and they adopt Australia's fascist rules, they are now over us.
[01:31:06.111 --> 01:31:12.894]  So Big Tech is becoming the global government of surveillance and censorship and debanking and control right in front of us.
[01:31:12.914 --> 01:31:16.115]   That's why this hearing I saw it last week.
[01:31:16.175 --> 01:31:17.316]  I think it's May 6th.
[01:31:17.516 --> 01:31:19.317]  It starts in Congress.
[01:31:19.377 --> 01:31:20.157]  It's so important.
[01:31:20.457 --> 01:31:22.919]  Can you speak to that and will you try to be there in D.C.
[01:31:23.619 --> 01:31:24.119]  in a few weeks?
[01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:26.581]  I definitely will be there.
[01:31:27.421 --> 01:31:38.007]  I would like to have a chance to explain why my verified Instagram account can just be seen in Germany.
[01:31:38.307 --> 01:31:38.807]  It's crazy.
[01:31:39.067 --> 01:31:42.069]  My Instagram account cannot be seen even in the United States.
[01:31:42.987 --> 01:31:48.191]  But the other accounts I created, I created 42 accounts on Instagram.
[01:31:48.251 --> 01:31:50.832]  Every time they blocked my account in Brazil, I create a new one.
[01:31:51.513 --> 01:31:55.636]  But this is not the same thing that happened on Axe.
[01:31:56.416 --> 01:32:01.660]  On Axe, I'm free to use my account and people in Brazil need to use VPN.
[01:32:02.358 --> 01:32:07.202]  But my first account on Instagram cannot be seen even in the United States.
[01:32:07.402 --> 01:32:10.185]  And that was a Supreme Court decision.
[01:32:10.665 --> 01:32:17.070]  If so, Meta is doing something against the Brazilian law and also against the United States law.
[01:32:17.331 --> 01:32:19.572]  And this is what I want to see on DC.
[01:32:20.133 --> 01:32:28.540]  If Meta and also Google with my YouTube, I used to have 1.3 million followers on YouTube.
[01:32:29.324 --> 01:32:32.046]  I want to know if they broke any law in America.
[01:32:32.666 --> 01:32:34.247]  Elon is being a freedom fighter.
[01:32:34.867 --> 01:32:45.013]  He is putting his head in this fight because he could enjoy his money, send people to Mars as he wants, and do his job.
[01:32:45.093 --> 01:32:47.454]  But he has bought Twitter to make acts.
[01:32:51.096 --> 01:32:55.818]  Available to everyone and make a good free speech square.
[01:32:56.378 --> 01:33:05.201]  So why they are going after him just because he gave freedom to people to do their show and their voice be listened.
[01:33:06.141 --> 01:33:07.302]  Look at right now.
[01:33:07.882 --> 01:33:09.863]  What is the biggest audience on X?
[01:33:10.523 --> 01:33:13.084]  You can see clear on my timeline.
[01:33:13.944 --> 01:33:14.484]  It's clear.
[01:33:14.504 --> 01:33:16.125]  This is InfoWars.
[01:33:17.908 --> 01:33:19.710]  And why they want to silence us?
[01:33:19.930 --> 01:33:23.732]  Why they want us not be heard by the people?
[01:33:24.112 --> 01:33:27.814]  What do we have to say to our audience that is so dangerous?
[01:33:28.755 --> 01:33:37.820]  I know, I know what it is, but I would like to make people wondering in their homes while they're watching us, why they want to silence people.
[01:33:38.561 --> 01:33:43.884]  And dictatorship is coming into the United States and we need to be aware of it.
[01:33:44.975 --> 01:33:51.037]  There is a file in the website, the Communist Party of the United States.
[01:33:51.158 --> 01:33:52.398]  There is a program in there.
[01:33:52.878 --> 01:33:55.719]  It's called Road to Socialism.
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:01.582]  You can read this Road to Socialism, the Communist Party of the United States program.
[01:34:02.022 --> 01:34:03.723]  It's the same program of the Democrats.
[01:34:05.983 --> 01:34:10.445]  I asked the people that are watching me right now, don't believe in me.
[01:34:10.645 --> 01:34:12.226]  Go there and see by yourself.
[01:34:12.955 --> 01:34:19.199]  The Communist Party of the United States program is the same program of the Democrats.
[01:34:19.599 --> 01:34:24.602]  They are turning this country into communism and this is not a conspiracy theory.
[01:34:25.383 --> 01:34:26.923]  You just can check by yourself.
[01:34:27.384 --> 01:34:35.929]  And they are doing it and they want to pack the United States Supreme Court because doing that, there is no other way to overturn this situation.
[01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:37.830]  And look how the corporate media, Alan, is spinning it.
[01:34:41.312 --> 01:34:45.734]  Here, oh, Musk is meddling in Brazil's democracy.
[01:34:45.754 --> 01:34:58.199]  But I've seen the footage of hundreds of thousands and millions marching in the streets against Lula and the Supreme Court and all the things he's doing to other popular candidates and taking people off the ballot and censorship and mass arrest.
[01:34:58.639 --> 01:35:06.662]  And then our media sides with the totalitarians and acts like Musk is meddling in a democracy by letting Brazilians have free speech.
[01:35:06.762 --> 01:35:07.843]  Wow, that's sick.
[01:35:09.298 --> 01:35:11.178]  Do you know why they use the word democracy?
[01:35:11.438 --> 01:35:14.819]  Because that word is not written in the United States Constitution.
[01:35:15.359 --> 01:35:16.199]  It's republic.
[01:35:16.719 --> 01:35:21.580]  They want to use this word democracy because everything fits in there.
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:23.461]  China is a democracy.
[01:35:23.761 --> 01:35:26.041]  North Korea, they use all this word democracy.
[01:35:26.061 --> 01:35:27.621]  It's the Democrat Party.
[01:35:27.861 --> 01:35:29.142]  It's the Democrat country.
[01:35:30.242 --> 01:35:33.702]  All communist countries love to use this word democracy.
[01:35:34.042 --> 01:35:42.182]   But if you ask everyone here in the United States, Tell me one country that you describe as a democratic country.
[01:35:42.923 --> 01:35:44.323]  They wouldn't say United States.
[01:35:44.383 --> 01:35:48.825]  They need to answer Cuba, North Korea, China.
[01:35:49.065 --> 01:35:57.648]  But if you ask them, can you tell me and describe to me what is the republic country that you would like to see in the United States?
[01:35:57.688 --> 01:35:59.868]  There is no other country like that.
[01:35:59.888 --> 01:36:02.389]  People don't know.
[01:36:02.589 --> 01:36:04.730]  Dictatorships call themselves democracies all the time.
[01:36:05.210 --> 01:36:08.894]   Greece thousands and three thousand years ago Exactly.
[01:36:08.713 --> 01:36:12.552]   some of their cities, they would vote to kill somebody they didn't like it.
[01:36:12.552 --> 01:36:16.354]   In a democracy, 51% could vote to make the other group slaves.
[01:36:16.354 --> 01:36:20.793]   In a republic, you have basic rights that are given from God, that are unalienable,
[01:36:20.793 --> 01:36:21.793]  that you cannot override.
[01:36:21.793 --> 01:36:26.393]   There's a basic code, and that's why they fear constitutional republics and then promote
[01:36:26.393 --> 01:36:28.514]  tyrannies as democracies.
[01:36:28.514 --> 01:36:29.993]  Exactly.
[01:36:29.993 --> 01:36:34.713]   And this is why the media is desperate, because they are losing their audience.
[01:36:34.926 --> 01:36:36.186]  They are losing everything.
[01:36:37.147 --> 01:36:39.427]  If you just use Axe, they're gonna lose.
[01:36:39.808 --> 01:36:41.688]  If you are on TV, they're gonna lose.
[01:36:41.808 --> 01:36:43.489]  If you are on radio, they're gonna lose.
[01:36:43.989 --> 01:36:46.870]  If you use newspaper, like Epoch Times, they're gonna lose.
[01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:53.739]   Everything that we say against them, We find people's heart.
[01:36:53.819 --> 01:36:57.381]  We find people looking at the same thing that we are describing.
[01:36:57.401 --> 01:36:59.362]  This is the point.
[01:36:59.502 --> 01:37:06.306]  When they use a word, an empty word like democracy, ask for them the reference of it in the reality.
[01:37:06.726 --> 01:37:07.387]  They can't.
[01:37:07.827 --> 01:37:12.170]   But while we Denounce them while we unmask them.
[01:37:12.670 --> 01:37:18.494]  We just ask people go and see the reference I'm using here to you and they're gonna see.
[01:37:18.694 --> 01:37:19.575]  Oh, yeah, that's true.
[01:37:20.015 --> 01:37:24.418]  You said that like you did like you are doing for years, Mr. Jones.
[01:37:25.038 --> 01:37:28.060]  Everything that you unmasked, it's coming.
[01:37:28.301 --> 01:37:29.741]  It's coming to the light.
[01:37:30.222 --> 01:37:31.643]  I mean, everyone can see that.
[01:37:31.663 --> 01:37:35.305]  And let me interrupt you for a moment because you're making great points.
[01:37:35.585 --> 01:37:36.306]  You just add this.
[01:37:37.166 --> 01:37:38.287]  It would take an hour to go over the numbers.
[01:37:38.347 --> 01:37:39.068]  Maybe I can pull these up.
[01:37:39.858 --> 01:37:48.164]  All the top talk show hosts, everywhere, all over the world, are populist, pro-free market, pro-God, pro-family.
[01:37:48.645 --> 01:37:49.726]  We're winning everywhere.
[01:37:49.746 --> 01:37:54.830]  The globalist First Minister just got removed in Scotland yesterday.
[01:37:54.850 --> 01:37:57.251]  You have a hundred other examples.
[01:37:57.291 --> 01:37:59.173]  They're losing everywhere.
[01:37:59.673 --> 01:38:05.258]  They're desperate, and their answer is sue people, arrest people, raid people, surveil people.
[01:38:05.538 --> 01:38:14.504]   And so when you say that, I mean, because I know about you, I've seen your stuff for years, You were reaching 10, 20, 30 million people a day in Brazil and all over Latin America as an example.
[01:38:14.524 --> 01:38:17.465]  There's a bunch of other journalists that have had to flee as well who were very prominent.
[01:38:17.485 --> 01:38:18.506]  You're probably the most prominent of them.
[01:38:18.766 --> 01:38:21.247]  So when you say we're winning, you're not just saying that.
[01:38:21.688 --> 01:38:23.649]  This is desperation by the tyrants.
[01:38:25.770 --> 01:38:26.470]  Definitely it is.
[01:38:27.451 --> 01:38:29.512]  And they want people afraid.
[01:38:30.432 --> 01:38:31.133]  That's the point.
[01:38:31.813 --> 01:38:41.730]   Because when we are afraid, you know, psychologically speaking, or you become hysterical, Or you will be arrested.
[01:38:42.331 --> 01:38:45.455]  And I would like to indicate a book, Horneurology.
[01:38:46.857 --> 01:38:50.662]  It was written by a psychiatrist from Poland.
[01:38:50.682 --> 01:38:56.731]  It was written here, by the way, in the United States, because it couldn't be written in other countries.
[01:38:57.523 --> 01:39:05.971]  He described everything that happened with people in Poland during the Nazi occupation and during the communist occupation.
[01:39:06.471 --> 01:39:16.360]  And he realized that during the communist occupation invasion, let us say, in Poland, people started to become hysterical.
[01:39:16.881 --> 01:39:23.167]  And hysteria, we need to explain, it's when you start feeling what you're talking.
[01:39:23.787 --> 01:39:28.272]  It's not you talk about your feelings.
[01:39:28.292 --> 01:39:30.574]  You start feeling what you're talking about.
[01:39:30.614 --> 01:39:35.078]  Like I see people here in the United States, Trump is creating dictatorship!
[01:39:35.459 --> 01:39:37.080]  He's believing his words!
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.922]  There's no dictatorship in the United States!
[01:39:39.583 --> 01:39:40.003]  Come on!
[01:39:40.664 --> 01:39:44.007]  Well, the left is the deep states trying to put one in.
[01:39:44.067 --> 01:39:44.848]  Trump's the opposite.
[01:39:45.766 --> 01:39:46.627]  But they're hysterical.
[01:39:46.728 --> 01:39:50.613]  Oh, we've got to arrest Trump and arrest all supporters because they're going to be dictators.
[01:39:50.813 --> 01:39:54.639]  That's dictatorship, what they're calling for, to counter something that's not a dictatorship.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:56.401]  Exactly.
[01:39:56.581 --> 01:40:00.967]  Look at what's happening right now in the US universities.
[01:40:02.003 --> 01:40:06.429]  We never have seen such a thing among people that want the United States Constitution.
[01:40:07.029 --> 01:40:08.371]  They are the dictatorship.
[01:40:08.491 --> 01:40:16.782]  They are the ones that have militia and all these conspiracy crazy things about right wing and the defense of the West.
[01:40:17.944 --> 01:40:35.122]  They want to silence you, who's watching me right now, because they know if you speak to your parents, if you speak to your child, if you speak in a church, if you speak among the people who work with you, you're going to win, because truth is always going to win.
[01:40:35.622 --> 01:40:44.873]  They are afraid of you, they are afraid of me, they are afraid of Mr. Jones, they are afraid of all these people who are speaking the truth because they know nothing can beat the truth.
[01:40:45.273 --> 01:40:45.734]  Nothing!
[01:40:46.335 --> 01:41:06.325]   And they want to silence us and arrest us because Making people afraid, they can start becoming hysterical and starting to believe that all this Democrat agenda is the agenda that came from heaven and will make everyone live in a world with peace and love.
[01:41:06.806 --> 01:41:07.626]  They are liars.
[01:41:08.186 --> 01:41:12.048]  They know that if they confront the truth, they can't win.
[01:41:13.983 --> 01:41:22.913]  Of course, it's not worthy if you're in a debate, you lose a debate, but you can arrest your opponent.
[01:41:23.153 --> 01:41:25.736]  We can't do that and we don't want to do that.
[01:41:26.477 --> 01:41:40.577]   So in this case, they are in advance because they can lose their elections, they can lose media, views, but once they lose everything and they can
[01:41:40.577 --> 01:41:48.597]   arrest you and put you with fear in your family, they win.
[01:41:48.597 --> 01:41:52.637]  But if we fight back and we say, "No, you cannot arrest me.
[01:41:52.637 --> 01:41:53.837]  You cannot silence me."
[01:41:53.837 --> 01:41:56.236]  They're going to lose.
[01:41:56.236 --> 01:41:57.236]  That's right.
[01:41:57.236 --> 01:41:58.356]  They've gone to the final refuge.
[01:41:58.356 --> 01:42:02.957]   The final refuge of tyrants is force, as George Orwell said, that once the illusion's over,
[01:42:02.957 --> 01:42:03.957]  all they have is force.
[01:42:03.957 --> 01:42:09.077]   And so for people that don't know, Trump goes to New York, where it's total election fraud,
[01:42:09.077 --> 01:42:13.556]   80% Democrat votes, but everybody mobs him, everybody hates Biden.
[01:42:13.556 --> 01:42:16.677]  Same thing in Brazil, from what I've seen.
[01:42:16.635 --> 01:42:20.416]  All of the populists, all of the conservatives, all the nationalists are super popular.
[01:42:20.856 --> 01:42:21.516]  They know that.
[01:42:21.576 --> 01:42:24.397]  That's why they're so panicked that this is happening.
[01:42:25.017 --> 01:42:31.058]  What do you expect the evil people to do to try to block this global awakening that's happening, Alan?
[01:42:33.498 --> 01:42:35.038]  Killing people and arresting people.
[01:42:35.559 --> 01:42:36.899]  That's what they are already doing.
[01:42:38.499 --> 01:42:43.460]  As I said, there is a congressman arrested in Brazil right now, Daniel Silveira.
[01:42:44.696 --> 01:42:47.779]  So there is no constitutional explanation to that.
[01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:52.262]  His arrest, it's totally unlawful.
[01:42:52.723 --> 01:42:56.246]  When you do that, all the other congressmen will be afraid.
[01:42:56.826 --> 01:42:58.648]  But we need to stop being afraid.
[01:42:58.668 --> 01:43:08.088]   I mean, right now, we need to have the courage to But our country, like if you are an American, put American first.
[01:43:08.568 --> 01:43:10.649]  If you're Brazilian, put Brazilian first.
[01:43:11.129 --> 01:43:16.791]  And we need to fight against this bloc, international blocs that want to dictate into our countries.
[01:43:17.311 --> 01:43:19.972]  They want to kill and arrest us.
[01:43:20.492 --> 01:43:22.933]  And of course, they know they can't arrest everyone.
[01:43:22.953 --> 01:43:31.336]  So they just pick up some people and put them in front of the court, start doing this dictatorship through the judiciary.
[01:43:31.916 --> 01:43:33.716]  Because that can make people afraid.
[01:43:33.877 --> 01:43:34.697]  And again, look at this.
[01:43:34.777 --> 01:43:38.377]  Brazilian lawmaker arrested for video insulting Supreme Court.
[01:43:39.378 --> 01:43:41.758]  So, this is backfiring, obviously.
[01:43:41.778 --> 01:43:47.940]  And if we simply stand up as men and women now at this critical juncture, they're going to lose.
[01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:49.440]  How do you see them losing?
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:50.340]  How does it unfold?
[01:43:52.341 --> 01:43:53.021]  The Supreme Court?
[01:43:53.601 --> 01:43:53.941]  All of it.
[01:43:54.161 --> 01:43:55.961]  Not just in your country, but just everywhere.
[01:43:56.481 --> 01:43:57.822]  How do you see if we stand up?
[01:43:57.882 --> 01:43:58.542]  How does this happen?
[01:44:00.683 --> 01:44:01.703]  I'll be honest with you.
[01:44:03.184 --> 01:44:09.685]  We need to make all these independent journalists, independent media be huge.
[01:44:11.146 --> 01:44:12.466]  But enormous.
[01:44:13.046 --> 01:44:19.448]  Because once we have information, we can reach the people who are sleeping right now.
[01:44:19.588 --> 01:44:20.628]  And that's what Elon's doing.
[01:44:20.668 --> 01:44:23.209]  He's rock-starring people that have courage.
[01:44:23.249 --> 01:44:23.969]  We should all do that.
[01:44:25.493 --> 01:44:25.973]  Exactly.
[01:44:26.573 --> 01:44:30.334]  And because our enemies are very well funded, OK?
[01:44:30.774 --> 01:44:31.474]  But we are not.
[01:44:32.095 --> 01:44:32.855]  And that's the point.
[01:44:33.195 --> 01:44:40.977]  We need to reach the people in our countries that are still sleeping about all these facts, because the media is controlling their mind.
[01:44:41.317 --> 01:44:42.957]  The school is controlling their minds.
[01:44:43.417 --> 01:44:50.439]  They have no tool to escape from this matrix reality they believe they are in.
[01:44:50.919 --> 01:45:01.065]  So we need to wake them up, like saying, look, you need to listen to all the people instead of the outlet media and all of this mainstream media.
[01:45:01.805 --> 01:45:03.066]  We need to talk to them.
[01:45:03.466 --> 01:45:05.307]  And this is why they are trying to silence us.
[01:45:05.847 --> 01:45:10.810]  If we reach them out, we can just show the options to them.
[01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:20.055]  And I do believe we need to conquer people's hearts in our countries and make them see, look, don't be afraid.
[01:45:20.859 --> 01:45:21.680]  Don't be afraid.
[01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:25.163]  I know you at home, you think, oh, I'm alone here.
[01:45:25.183 --> 01:45:28.025]  I just have my Axe account.
[01:45:28.226 --> 01:45:29.106]  How can I make a change?
[01:45:29.126 --> 01:45:32.570]  But like Elon, we've got to say, you want to take my speech, make me a slave?
[01:45:32.630 --> 01:45:34.812]  Go fuck yourselves.
[01:45:34.872 --> 01:45:37.874]  Just like you went and flipped off the Supreme Court when they raided your house.
[01:45:38.235 --> 01:45:39.856]  You were saying, hey, I'm a man.
[01:45:39.976 --> 01:45:40.977]  I'm not backing down.
[01:45:41.898 --> 01:45:44.160]  I'm standing up because it's the right thing to do.
[01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:45.101]  Go fuck yourself.
[01:45:46.209 --> 01:45:47.610]  Yeah, we need more people like this.
[01:45:48.331 --> 01:45:51.794]  Why don't you say, it'll be a viral clip if you want, Alan Dos Santos.
[01:45:51.814 --> 01:45:53.916]  You want to tell the New World Order, go fuck yourself?
[01:45:55.057 --> 01:45:55.737]  Oh, definitely.
[01:45:56.038 --> 01:45:56.478]  Of course.
[01:45:57.059 --> 01:45:58.960]  Go fuck yourself, New World Order.
[01:45:59.281 --> 01:46:01.002]  Go fuck yourself, all the globalists.
[01:46:01.803 --> 01:46:03.484]  I don't care, really.
[01:46:03.504 --> 01:46:08.549]  I really want everyone dictatorship, go fuck yourself.
[01:46:10.225 --> 01:46:16.992]  Definitely, because my family, my values, my country and the God, I believe I'm afraid of God.
[01:46:17.012 --> 01:46:21.056]  I'm not afraid of any globalists, any communists that is trying to silence me.
[01:46:21.197 --> 01:46:24.140]  I really want to make them go fuck yourself.
[01:46:25.081 --> 01:46:27.683]  I just did it in Portuguese, by the way, in my timeline.
[01:46:27.723 --> 01:46:28.284]  You can see that.
[01:46:29.133 --> 01:46:30.654]  Beautifuls, do five more minutes with us.
[01:46:30.674 --> 01:46:32.977]  I want to invite you back for a commercial-free podcast.

[01:46:41.524 --> 01:46:42.105]  So important.

[01:46:49.133 --> 01:46:54.418]  It's just my website is tercarlivre.com or tercarlivre.com.br.

[01:47:02.945 --> 01:47:04.487]  Unfortunately, it's just in Portuguese.
[01:47:05.107 --> 01:47:06.148]  But that could help a lot.
[01:47:06.288 --> 01:47:08.670]  If you are in Brazil, it's another address.
[01:47:08.690 --> 01:47:13.033]  But if you are outside of Brazil... Beautiful, but if people find you spread it, the tyrants fear you.

[01:50:17.158 --> 01:50:20.878]  Alan Dos Santos is our amazing guest.

[01:50:29.444 --> 01:50:30.584]  All right, Alan, I'm very impressed.
[01:50:30.604 --> 01:50:35.687]  We got five minutes to break, and then we got a big economic guest joining us.
[01:50:35.707 --> 01:50:37.788]  I interrupted you some, but it's all riveting what you're saying.
[01:50:38.128 --> 01:50:40.229]  You got five minutes closing comments here, my brother.
[01:50:42.288 --> 01:50:43.348]  Thank you so much.
[01:50:43.368 --> 01:50:52.111]  So I was trying to explain why they pick up some people and try to arrest them and put them in jail just to make everyone afraid of them.
[01:50:53.111 --> 01:50:56.832]  They start doing this, smearing innocent people, putting them in court.
[01:50:57.612 --> 01:50:59.773]  This is a very old strategy among the communists.
[01:51:00.633 --> 01:51:03.334]  And we need more people not being afraid of them.
[01:51:04.074 --> 01:51:07.875]  And we do have that in the United States and also in Brazil.
[01:51:08.315 --> 01:51:09.615]  But we need to encourage them.
[01:51:09.995 --> 01:51:11.876]  We need to face them as they are.
[01:51:12.938 --> 01:51:15.080]  They are very revolutionaries.
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:16.641]  They want to kill your children.
[01:51:16.701 --> 01:51:20.284]  They want to kill your wife and your family.
[01:51:20.945 --> 01:51:21.946]  And don't let that happen.
[01:51:22.886 --> 01:51:24.468]  Because they are not afraid of it.
[01:51:25.048 --> 01:51:31.313]  They believe in a cause, in a very strange and weird cause that nobody has seen before.
[01:51:32.014 --> 01:51:39.300]  But they want to make you believe that they are the possible people that want to do that.
[01:51:42.363 --> 01:51:43.124]  Please continue.
[01:51:44.365 --> 01:51:54.635]  Yes, so we need to fight them back, funding very independent media, because this is the most important battle that we have.
[01:51:55.399 --> 01:51:58.020]  We are fighting with our words.
[01:51:58.580 --> 01:52:01.041]  We are explaining people what they are doing.
[01:52:01.601 --> 01:52:06.323]  And behind the scenes, the media, the outlet media, will not tell you what is happening.
[01:52:06.603 --> 01:52:18.387]  All these pedophilia rings, all these narco connections that they have, like in Brazil, the media, and even the Supreme Court has ties, they have ties with all these crap people.
[01:52:18.767 --> 01:52:21.808]  They release criminals and they arrest innocent people.
[01:52:22.926 --> 01:52:34.953]   Once we independent media, independent journalists like me, once we have the The means to achieve our goals, we can wake all the peoples up.
[01:52:35.493 --> 01:52:43.256]  I heard the user, Mr. Jones, saying if 1% of our audience buy our products, we could reach our target.
[01:52:43.756 --> 01:52:49.999]  We need to make people understand that we are not being funded by all this globalist crap, all this communist crap.
[01:52:50.419 --> 01:52:56.681]  So the only one way we can achieve more people is funding our independent journalism.
[01:52:57.201 --> 01:52:58.722]  And this is what they are afraid of.
[01:52:59.968 --> 01:53:07.475]  And imagine a famous journalist from CNN or Fox News or whatever, if they start their own show, nobody watch it.
[01:53:08.295 --> 01:53:09.897]  Nobody will watch them.
[01:53:10.737 --> 01:53:18.043]  But what happened with a very good journalist to start again from scratch every time he still has audience.
[01:53:18.143 --> 01:53:19.364]  This is what happened to me.
[01:53:19.405 --> 01:53:21.026]  This is what happened to you, Mr. Jones.
[01:53:21.784 --> 01:53:22.805]  They are afraid of it.
[01:53:23.566 --> 01:53:35.660]  Once they have this huge structure, like CNN, MSNBC, they can put everyone in that they want and people will forget all these crap journalists that was fired or forgotten.
[01:53:37.265 --> 01:53:43.533]  And all the new journalists they put in there, it's like fresh milk, you know, to the audience.
[01:53:43.933 --> 01:53:47.117]  It's like a new person that will try to deceive you.
[01:53:47.718 --> 01:53:51.763]  But a very good journalist can explain everything they're doing.
[01:53:51.823 --> 01:54:02.252]   Like I said, right now, read the Democratic Party Uh, program and compare that with the Communist Party of United States program is the same program.
[01:54:02.452 --> 01:54:09.038]  They are communists, but they don't, they just don't want to know you are reading both programs and comparing them.
[01:54:09.398 --> 01:54:14.582]  They, they try to, uh, to be hidden in, in words like liberal.
[01:54:14.722 --> 01:54:15.343]  They're not liberal.
[01:54:16.313 --> 01:54:18.815]  They want to use the words like progressive.
[01:54:18.875 --> 01:54:19.816]  No, they are not progressive.
[01:54:20.156 --> 01:54:23.519]  They're just communists and they just want to kill this country.
[01:54:23.999 --> 01:54:27.262]  Why they want to kill the United States as it is?
[01:54:27.762 --> 01:54:36.649]  Because once the United States Constitution is gone, this country will really turn into a third world country as every other country.
[01:54:37.785 --> 01:54:42.426]  Don't think that United States is like a super country that cannot be defeated.
[01:54:42.906 --> 01:54:47.587]  If they pack the Supreme Court, if they still keep doing this, they will destroy this country.
[01:54:47.627 --> 01:54:50.787]  Well, that's what Bukele of El Salvador and so many others have warned.
[01:54:51.187 --> 01:54:52.948]  Alan Dos Santos, thank you so much.
[01:54:52.968 --> 01:54:53.708]  We're going to follow you.
[01:54:53.728 --> 01:54:54.908]  I'm going to talk to you again soon.
[01:54:55.428 --> 01:54:58.989]  We appreciate you fighting for humanity and God bless you in Brazil.
[01:54:59.229 --> 01:55:00.029]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:55:00.089 --> 01:55:00.409]  Thank you.
[01:55:01.129 --> 01:55:02.249]  Thank you so much, Mr. Jones.
[01:55:02.549 --> 01:55:03.069]  God bless you.
[01:55:03.089 --> 01:55:03.830]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:55:03.850 --> 01:55:04.750]  I want to meet you in person.
[01:55:04.770 --> 01:55:05.210]  We love you.
[01:55:05.029 --> 01:55:18.269]   you what a great person and now some comic relief
[01:55:16.558 --> 01:55:18.541]  There's been a new indictment of President Trump.
[01:55:19.302 --> 01:55:20.984]  He robbed Congressman Schiff.
[01:55:21.565 --> 01:55:23.969]  Not our guest, Peter Schiff.
[01:55:27.389 --> 01:55:28.170]  Congressman Schiff!
[01:55:28.190 --> 01:55:28.550]  Yeah?
[01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:30.411]  Can you tell us about the robbery?
[01:55:30.711 --> 01:55:31.772]  It was horrible.
[01:55:31.792 --> 01:55:34.434]  I'll never be the same after this.
[01:55:34.494 --> 01:55:35.775]  It wasn't me!
[01:55:36.135 --> 01:55:37.736]  It was the one-armed man!
[01:55:37.756 --> 01:55:39.017]  Did you see your attacker?
[01:55:39.117 --> 01:55:39.417]  No.
[01:55:40.258 --> 01:55:45.381]  It happened so fast, but the wizard lawyer told me it was a Russian robber.
[01:55:45.481 --> 01:55:49.144]  Hey, did somebody order a pizza, pasta, and hot dogs?
[01:55:49.404 --> 01:55:50.304]  Wink, wink.
[01:55:50.324 --> 01:55:52.126]  A Russian robber, like he was in a hurry?
[01:55:52.166 --> 01:55:52.546]  No.
[01:55:53.266 --> 01:55:56.108]  A Russian robber from Russia.
[01:55:57.911 --> 01:55:59.958]  This is truly the darkest day!
[01:56:01.172 --> 01:56:02.652]  In American history!
[01:56:03.112 --> 01:56:04.113]  I wasn't there!
[01:56:04.953 --> 01:56:06.813]  I could have like almost died!
[01:56:07.633 --> 01:56:10.354]  And you know the robber would like totally try and take me!
[01:56:10.574 --> 01:56:14.335]  I've never heard of anything like this happening in California!
[01:56:14.475 --> 01:56:16.395]  It was probably that racist Trump!
[01:56:16.515 --> 01:56:17.796]  Peach, phone and phone!
[01:56:17.816 --> 01:56:21.397]  Now I know what it feels like to be eating Harold!
[01:56:21.437 --> 01:56:23.517]  This kind of stuff just doesn't happen here!
[01:56:23.677 --> 01:56:25.778]  California is the safest place on Earth!
[01:56:25.998 --> 01:56:27.498]  Haven't you seen my district?
[01:56:28.218 --> 01:56:31.639]  I'm still trying to put the pieces of my life back together.
[01:56:32.419 --> 01:56:33.180]  I can't sleep.
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:34.480]  I can't eat.
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:37.681]  Well, except for the hot dogs and pasta.
[01:56:38.321 --> 01:56:41.142]  But the doctor says I'm unfixable!
[01:56:41.162 --> 01:56:42.102]  So there I was.
[01:56:42.583 --> 01:56:52.308]   Riding my wet car- So there I was, riding my bicycle in San Francisco, when all of a sudden, I saw Donald Trump stealing Adam Schiff's suitcase!
[01:56:52.468 --> 01:56:54.029]  I knew it was Trump all along!
[01:56:54.049 --> 01:56:56.831]  Things like this just don't happen in California!
[01:56:56.911 --> 01:56:58.752]  You know, I had a feeling it was Trump, but...
[01:56:59.612 --> 01:57:00.893]  I just didn't want to say anything.
[01:57:00.933 --> 01:57:04.777]  Trump need to be thrown in jail for the rest of his life with his peach 45!
[01:57:05.457 --> 01:57:06.538]  We have breaking news!
[01:57:06.939 --> 01:57:15.546]  Twice impeached, four times indicted, not sure President Donald J. Trump viciously robs Congressman Adam Schiff in California and then brags about it on Truth Social!
[01:57:15.826 --> 01:57:18.669]  See here, I'm declaring a state of emergency!
[01:57:20.210 --> 01:57:23.132]  America is not safe with this maniac on the loose!
[01:57:24.213 --> 01:57:25.274]  Pause for applause.
[01:57:29.492 --> 01:57:31.953]  Uh, until Trump is captured!
[01:57:32.154 --> 01:57:37.316]  I have launched a fully funded taxpayer investigation into Trump's California smashing grab!
[01:57:37.696 --> 01:57:39.837]  We will not rest until Trump is in jail!
[01:57:39.877 --> 01:57:40.938]  Hey, hey, hey!
[01:57:41.238 --> 01:57:48.322]  Today I'm announcing the indictment for Donald J. Trump for his criminal behavior in California!
[01:57:48.362 --> 01:57:48.762]  Me too!
[01:57:49.782 --> 01:57:50.683]  So am I!
[01:57:50.803 --> 01:57:53.705]  Is this what Trump is doing to pay for his lawyer fees?
[01:57:53.965 --> 01:57:55.806]  Stealing innocent people's luggage?
[01:57:55.946 --> 01:57:58.388]  Criminals like this don't belong in America!
[01:57:58.528 --> 01:57:59.688]  I tried to warn ya!
[01:57:59.969 --> 01:58:02.910]  Dictator Donald Trump belongs in prison!
[01:58:02.930 --> 01:58:06.693]  30 years ago, Donald Trump grabbed me by the luggage!
[01:58:08.114 --> 01:58:09.835]  He grabbed me by the luggage too!
[01:58:10.375 --> 01:58:12.336]  Alright!
[01:58:15.734 --> 01:58:24.178]  Peter Schiff, great economist, big company, predicted everything that's going on now in the last 20 years and on my show as well.
[01:58:24.198 --> 01:58:25.319]  Plus, I was good friends with his dad.
[01:58:25.339 --> 01:58:29.861]  EuroPAC.com, SchiffRadio.com, at Peter Schiff.
[01:58:30.822 --> 01:58:34.864]  And as he predicted, gold and silver exploding, inflation everywhere.
[01:58:34.904 --> 01:58:35.724]  They tried to deny it.
[01:58:35.804 --> 01:58:37.205]  Now they admit it's here.
[01:58:37.365 --> 01:58:41.987]  Monetization of debt, the Federal Reserve, all of it as we are on the precipice.
[01:58:42.147 --> 01:58:48.228]   I think it's fair to say We've been on top of Time Bomb for decades, but now the bomb has exploded.
[01:58:48.248 --> 01:58:54.292]  I think it's a reality to face that we are in a whole new ballgame.
[01:58:54.792 --> 01:58:56.754]  So, Peter Schiff, great to have you with us.
[01:58:57.554 --> 01:58:58.235]  Where should we start?
[01:59:00.131 --> 01:59:02.672]  Hi Alex, nice to see you again.
[01:59:02.912 --> 01:59:07.034]  You know, gold and silver, they haven't even really started to explode yet.
[01:59:07.054 --> 01:59:08.375]  I mean, they have gone up.
[01:59:08.675 --> 01:59:11.016]  Silver isn't even close to making a new high yet.
[01:59:11.536 --> 01:59:13.077]  Gold made a new high, got above $2,400.
[01:59:13.117 --> 01:59:14.117]  I think right now it's around $2,330, $2,340.
[01:59:19.028 --> 01:59:23.293]  But I think the explosion is yet to come because most people aren't even buying it yet.
[01:59:23.333 --> 01:59:40.352]  They don't even realize that they need to because most people still believe the false narrative that inflation is going to come back down to 2% and that all the Fed has to do is hold off on the rate cuts for a little bit longer and just let the inflation rate come down.
[01:59:41.016 --> 01:59:42.736]  But that's completely false.
[01:59:43.057 --> 01:59:45.017]  I mean, we're not going anywhere near two percent.
[01:59:45.517 --> 01:59:48.118]  You know, we're going in the other direction and we're going to accelerate.
[01:59:48.678 --> 01:59:54.899]  And the markets have still not come to terms with the reality that high inflation is here to stay.
[01:59:55.279 --> 01:59:56.380]  And it's going to get worse.
[01:59:57.480 --> 02:00:00.801]  And you said that a couple of years ago when Biden said there's not inflation.
[02:00:00.861 --> 02:00:01.441]  He said that.
[02:00:01.461 --> 02:00:03.181]  They went, well, it's not that bad.
[02:00:03.201 --> 02:00:07.142]  And now the CNN admits we were losing the battle against inflation.
[02:00:07.542 --> 02:00:09.623]  What is the real inflation number from your research?
[02:00:10.734 --> 02:00:17.176]  Well, I mean, my guess is that at least double what the official numbers would lead.
[02:00:17.536 --> 02:00:22.858]  So if the CPI is now down to 3, 4 percent, so we're probably at 7, 8 percent.
[02:00:23.238 --> 02:00:26.979]  But that means when we got up to 9 percent, we were at 18 percent.
[02:00:27.479 --> 02:00:36.122]  But most of the reports that you look at show that just since the beginning of the Biden administration, the cost of living is up about 30 or 40 percent.
[02:00:36.542 --> 02:00:44.622]   Now that is a huge increase and it really amounts to a tax to cover the increased cost of government spending.
[02:00:44.622 --> 02:00:47.342]  Now that's why Americans are struggling.
[02:00:47.342 --> 02:00:53.481]   That's why Biden is the most unpopular president in the history of popularity polls.
[02:00:53.481 --> 02:00:57.581]  And Harris is the most unpopular vice president.
[02:00:57.581 --> 02:01:01.061]  You have, the savings rate has imploded.
[02:01:01.061 --> 02:01:04.862]   Credit card debt is at an all time record high and more Americans than ever before
[02:01:04.862 --> 02:01:06.221]  are forced to moonlight.
[02:01:06.335 --> 02:01:10.281]  People are working second and third jobs because that's the only way to pay the bills.
[02:01:10.321 --> 02:01:11.663]  They can't cover the rent.
[02:01:12.143 --> 02:01:15.825]  Put food on the table, pay their electric bill on one job anymore.
[02:01:16.025 --> 02:01:19.567]  Because the value of that paycheck has been eviscerated by inflation.
[02:01:19.887 --> 02:01:21.608]  So now they have to take two or three jobs.
[02:01:21.628 --> 02:01:28.051]  And then you have Joe Biden bragging about all those jobs he created when the people who have them would prefer not to.
[02:01:28.607 --> 02:01:29.969]  So you predicted all of this.
[02:01:30.029 --> 02:01:33.954]  I won't go over all the predictions that came true, but I'd say a 95% accuracy rate.
[02:01:34.575 --> 02:01:35.616]  What are you predicting?
[02:01:36.137 --> 02:01:44.808]  First off, how would you describe the real economy in your own words right now versus what CNN and CNBC tells us and the Wall Street Journal tells us?
[02:01:44.888 --> 02:01:46.330]  And then what do you think is coming next?
[02:01:47.537 --> 02:01:49.118]  Well, I just think it's a bubble.
[02:01:49.178 --> 02:01:50.018]  It's a barrage.
[02:01:50.098 --> 02:01:53.900]  I mean, it's being held together by debt and inflation.
[02:01:54.261 --> 02:01:56.902]  I think the entire banking system is insolvent.
[02:01:57.562 --> 02:01:57.963]  The U.S.
[02:01:58.003 --> 02:01:59.403]  government is insolvent.
[02:02:00.024 --> 02:02:20.411]   The reason the banks are insolvent is for more than a decade, while the Fed held interest rates near zero, Banks loaded up on long-term treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, which are now dramatically underwater, but the banks are able to pretend that they don't have these losses because they claim they're holding these notes to maturity.
[02:02:20.691 --> 02:02:32.075]  But over the weekend, another bank failed because you can't pretend forever that you're solvent because eventually your customers, the depositors, want the money back and the banks don't have it because they've lost it.
[02:02:32.575 --> 02:02:33.876]  And the government is insolvent.
[02:02:33.896 --> 02:02:38.257]  We have a $35 trillion national debt financed with T-bills.
[02:02:38.777 --> 02:02:42.879]  Right now, interest on the national debt is about $1.1 trillion a year.
[02:02:43.119 --> 02:02:45.179]  That's more than we spend on national defense.
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:53.702]  If interest rates just stay where they are, don't go any higher, next year it'll be $2 trillion a year interest on the debt.
[02:02:54.142 --> 02:02:59.644]  That's more than we spend on Medicare or Social Security, which means it'll be the single biggest line item in the budget.
[02:03:00.164 --> 02:03:06.872]   And a few years after that, Interest will consume 100% of tax revenue, meaning every penny the U.S.
[02:03:06.912 --> 02:03:11.516]  government collects in taxes will have to go to pay for interest on the money it already borrowed.
[02:03:11.676 --> 02:03:14.018]  Not the principal, just the interest.
[02:03:14.279 --> 02:03:22.226]  So this is a complete insolvent government, and the whole economy, I think, is built on this foundation that's about to collapse.
[02:03:24.053 --> 02:03:24.734]  I agree with you.
[02:03:24.754 --> 02:03:26.395]  It's like somebody that has heart failure.
[02:03:26.415 --> 02:03:28.476]  You know they're going to end up dying.
[02:03:28.516 --> 02:03:29.457]  You just don't know when.
[02:03:29.477 --> 02:03:32.860]  And that's happening in my own family right now.
[02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:33.480]  It's very, very sad.
[02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:35.382]  It's finally actually happening right now.
[02:03:35.402 --> 02:03:37.683]  A family member of mine actually died today.
[02:03:37.744 --> 02:03:39.265]  But this is a country.
[02:03:39.325 --> 02:03:40.105]  This is the world.
[02:03:40.666 --> 02:03:41.626]  This is everywhere.
[02:03:41.666 --> 02:03:44.128]  And all these countries have these insane debts.
[02:03:44.168 --> 02:03:49.573]  All these Western countries and China and Europe and the UK.
[02:03:51.053 --> 02:03:52.433]  What are the triggers?
[02:03:52.473 --> 02:03:54.054]  You're kind of mentioning bank failures.
[02:03:54.094 --> 02:03:56.575]  We saw a few years ago some regional bank failures.
[02:03:56.595 --> 02:03:57.415]  They bailed them out.
[02:03:57.495 --> 02:03:58.475]  That was a contagion.
[02:03:58.835 --> 02:04:01.376]  Now more regional banks and banks are failing.
[02:04:01.716 --> 02:04:07.178]  What are the triggers that could bring us into this full collapse?
[02:04:08.718 --> 02:04:13.900]  Well, I think that the trigger is probably going to be when the creditors don't want to finance it anymore.
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:41.325]   I mean, as long as we can keep on borrowing, We could keep kicking the can down the road, but it's it's increasingly more difficult to do that the deeper in the debt we go and When it's you know almost impossible to just pay the interest on the debt The creditors start to worry about your ability to pay the principal and then they want their money back You know, we have to roll this debt over every time it matures and I think what's gonna happen is
[02:04:41.524 --> 02:04:47.304]   is the lenders are going to back away and the Fed is going to have to fill the void
[02:04:47.304 --> 02:04:51.363]   by going back to quantitative easing and printing up even more money
[02:04:51.363 --> 02:04:55.104]   to buy U.S. government bonds that nobody else will touch
[02:04:55.104 --> 02:04:58.003]  because the interest rates are still too low.
[02:04:58.003 --> 02:05:02.104]   You know, the Fed wants to claim that the interest rates we have now are restrictive.
[02:05:02.104 --> 02:05:02.944]  No, they're not.
[02:05:02.944 --> 02:05:05.104]  They're only five, five and a quarter percent.
[02:05:05.104 --> 02:05:07.444]  Long-term bond yields are four percentage.
[02:05:07.444 --> 02:05:08.903]  That's not restrictive.
[02:05:08.903 --> 02:05:11.644]   I mean, historically, ever since we went off the gold standard,
[02:05:11.644 --> 02:05:12.684]  that's low.
[02:05:12.684 --> 02:05:16.383]   They're just comparing the rates to the absurd rates we had.
[02:05:16.906 --> 02:05:22.689]  After the 2008 financial crisis, which are, you know, a big reason that we have so much inflation.
[02:05:22.970 --> 02:05:27.212]  They kept rates artificially low and, you know, flooded the economy with inflation.
[02:05:27.672 --> 02:05:29.253]  And now we're feeling the consequences.
[02:05:29.553 --> 02:05:32.895]  But just because rates are at 5% doesn't mean they're high.
[02:05:33.356 --> 02:05:34.936]  We're just comparing them to zero.
[02:05:35.457 --> 02:05:36.397]  But they're low.
[02:05:36.477 --> 02:05:39.979]  Look where Paul Volcker rates went to 21% short term rates.
[02:05:39.999 --> 02:05:41.901]  Bond yields were 16% when Volcker.
[02:05:44.704 --> 02:05:49.583]   was present. We've got a bigger inflation problem now than we had back in 1980.
[02:05:49.583 --> 02:05:53.824]   We don't back in 1980 we were the world's biggest creditor nation now we're the world's biggest
[02:05:53.824 --> 02:05:59.584]   debtor. We ran large trade surpluses in 1980. We're running big deficits. We're in much worse
[02:05:59.584 --> 02:06:04.383]   shape now than we were then. So interest rates should actually be higher now than they were then
[02:06:04.383 --> 02:06:10.704]   and it's not even close. So you like to talk about what's happening currently but you also
[02:06:10.704 --> 02:06:15.664]   predict the loss of coming the future. We talk about different contagions different triggers but
[02:06:17.344 --> 02:06:18.285]  I mean, just speculating.
[02:06:18.325 --> 02:06:19.226]  People want to know that.
[02:06:20.848 --> 02:06:21.328]  Dead reckoning.
[02:06:21.348 --> 02:06:26.673]  We know you're not making predictions here, but how do you see this unfolding and what would hyperinflation mean?
[02:06:27.594 --> 02:06:29.476]  What would QE infinity mean?
[02:06:29.496 --> 02:06:31.318]  How would this unfold?
[02:06:32.486 --> 02:06:35.330]  Yeah, I think you'll see it in the foreign exchange market.
[02:06:35.370 --> 02:06:40.418]  I mean, so far, the dollar has not been weak against other fiat currencies, especially the yen.
[02:06:41.139 --> 02:06:44.505]  They have their own inflation problem in Japan.
[02:06:45.025 --> 02:06:47.129]  They have a huge debt bubble there as well.
[02:06:47.938 --> 02:06:55.421]  But I think some of the relative weakness in the euro, the yen, the pound, has helped support the dollar on a relative basis.
[02:06:55.441 --> 02:06:58.882]  Of course, on an absolute basis, all those currencies are going down.
[02:06:58.922 --> 02:07:02.484]  You can see that with the price of gold, and you can see that with the cost of living.
[02:07:02.744 --> 02:07:05.725]  It costs more money, so currencies are losing value.
[02:07:05.905 --> 02:07:08.406]  So we have a weak dollar in absolute terms.
[02:07:08.486 --> 02:07:13.268]  It's only relative to other currencies that you can pretend that it's strong.
[02:07:13.748 --> 02:07:15.409]  But I think that's going to change.
[02:07:16.399 --> 02:07:27.186]  As our creditors really perceive the gravity of the fiscal problem that we have in the United States, and they don't want to finance it anymore.
[02:07:27.246 --> 02:07:30.908]  And I think the de-dollarization process has already started.
[02:07:30.948 --> 02:07:32.109]  It's just going slowly.
[02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:39.994]  You can see that in the gold price, because some of the main buyers of gold this year have been central banks.
[02:07:40.635 --> 02:07:47.277]  The emerging market, eastern central banks have been big buyers, even as individual investors have been sellers.
[02:07:47.297 --> 02:07:50.678]  I mean, Americans on balance have been selling their gold all year.
[02:07:51.138 --> 02:07:55.140]  As it's been going up, they've been liquidating their holdings in GLD.
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:59.361]  And I think it's the foreign central banks that have been buying that gold.
[02:07:59.401 --> 02:08:01.142]  So that's why the price has been rising.
[02:08:01.622 --> 02:08:04.903]  But they're buying it because they need an alternative to the dollar.
[02:08:06.038 --> 02:08:07.018]  They don't want dollars.
[02:08:07.038 --> 02:08:08.239]  They want to get rid of dollars.
[02:08:08.739 --> 02:08:10.019]  So they have to buy something.
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:13.460]  And right now they don't want the euro and they don't want the yen.
[02:08:14.261 --> 02:08:21.443]  And so they're buying gold and they're giving up the interest that they could otherwise earn on dollars by earning no interest on gold.
[02:08:21.503 --> 02:08:33.887]  And I think they're doing that because they perceive that the dollar is going to lose a lot of value and that the interest that they can earn doesn't even come close to covering the loss of purchasing power that they'd suffer by holding dollars.
[02:08:34.434 --> 02:08:40.498]  And we've been talking 20 years, at least, but I think now is the clearest time ever that what you're stating is fact.
[02:08:40.999 --> 02:08:45.642]  So, what will that look like for the average person as this unfolds?
[02:08:45.722 --> 02:08:49.224]  There's a thousand ways it can happen, but, I mean, take Alan Greenspan.
[02:08:49.304 --> 02:08:50.265]  I'm going to play a clip.
[02:08:50.865 --> 02:08:56.129]  He famously said on Laird NewsHour, we're separate from the government, no one's above us, we can do whatever we want.
[02:08:56.149 --> 02:08:58.591]  Years later, he said, we can print any amount of money we want.
[02:08:59.798 --> 02:09:03.599]  The United States can pay any debt it has because we can always print money to do that.
[02:09:03.418 --> 02:09:08.458]   this idea that they can print unlimited money is a lie and it's now manifesting.
[02:09:08.458 --> 02:09:12.698]   Mexico couldn't do it, Weimar Republic couldn't do it, Zimbabwe couldn't do it,
[02:09:12.698 --> 02:09:15.298]   sure we have a military to back it, but the chickens are coming home to roost.
[02:09:15.298 --> 02:09:22.578]   Here's Alan Greenspan. The United States can pay any debt it has because we can
[02:09:22.578 --> 02:09:29.457]   always print money to do that. So there is zero probability of default. Okay, so
[02:09:29.457 --> 02:09:33.578]   that's the first clip I want you to respond to, but let's play Larry Fink when he was
[02:09:33.578 --> 02:09:37.217]   being told about Bitcoin saying, "Okay, great Bitcoin, you know we're gonna give
[02:09:37.217 --> 02:09:40.177]  them a system to..."
[02:09:38.979 --> 02:09:41.041]  By Bitcoin, but forget that, I want gold.
[02:09:41.461 --> 02:09:42.722]  He's telling you right there.
[02:09:42.762 --> 02:09:43.102]  Here it is.
[02:09:44.543 --> 02:09:52.790]  You know, I believe it goes up as if the world is more frightened if people have fearful of geopolitical risk, they're fearful of their own risk.
[02:09:53.791 --> 02:09:57.354]  It's no different than what gold represented over thousands of years.
[02:09:57.474 --> 02:10:02.378]  It is a, it is a, it is a asset class that that protects you.
[02:10:03.238 --> 02:10:10.703]  And unlike gold where we manufacture new gold, we're almost at the ceiling of the amount of Bitcoin that we created.
[02:10:11.164 --> 02:10:28.036]  When you hear somebody like Kathy Wood, who was on our broadcast yesterday, say that her base case, base case, is that this turns into a $600,000 of Bitcoin valuation, base case, and a million plus in a super optimistic case.
[02:10:28.596 --> 02:10:29.897]  Are you anywhere in her realm?
[02:10:30.786 --> 02:10:31.627]  I haven't thought about it.
[02:10:32.167 --> 02:10:39.733]  To me, what we are trying to do is offer an instrument that can store wealth.
[02:10:40.053 --> 02:10:44.577]  I think if it gets even close to that high, gold will represent even a bigger value.
[02:10:45.257 --> 02:10:50.962]  And let's be clear, if you think of digital gold, there's going to be a reference point between gold and bitcoin.
[02:10:52.014 --> 02:11:00.919]  So thanks to that over a year ago, it's being proven right now that gold and silver and real commodities are the future.
[02:11:01.019 --> 02:11:04.281]  So I know you're not a big supporter of Bitcoin.
[02:11:04.701 --> 02:11:07.422]  I'm not an economist like you, so I've never really been heavily involved.
[02:11:07.463 --> 02:11:09.604]  I stuck my toe in it just to, you know, cover all bases.
[02:11:09.644 --> 02:11:11.725]  But where do you see Bitcoin versus gold?
[02:11:13.052 --> 02:11:15.274]  Yeah, well, first of all, you know, Alex, you're right.
[02:11:15.394 --> 02:11:21.881]  When I was on your show, you know, maybe let's say 10 years ago, talking about a lot of this stuff, it was more of a forecast.
[02:11:22.361 --> 02:11:24.163]  Now it's kind of already reality.
[02:11:24.643 --> 02:11:29.208]  It's just that some people are a little slow to recognize the reality.
[02:11:29.228 --> 02:11:33.492]  It's kind of like, you know, for years I was predicting the collapse of the subprime market.
[02:11:34.016 --> 02:11:45.546]  And even shorting it and in in 2007 early on when everything started to fall apart and it became obvious that everything I had been predicting about that market for four or five years had come true.
[02:11:46.166 --> 02:11:47.888]  Most people still didn't recognize it.
[02:11:48.744 --> 02:11:53.066]  And even after the subprime thing collapsed, the Fed didn't think it was a problem.
[02:11:54.307 --> 02:11:59.149]  Bernanke dismissed it as being contained, and all the others on Wall Street said, hey, it's no big deal.
[02:11:59.750 --> 02:12:02.971]  And it only took a few more months before we had the financial crisis.
[02:12:03.011 --> 02:12:07.654]  So I think we're at that point now where my forecasts have actually come true.
[02:12:08.134 --> 02:12:14.277]  It's just that the mainstream doesn't recognize that yet, and they won't until it's a full-blown crisis.
[02:12:14.972 --> 02:12:16.095]  And I think that's coming.
[02:12:19.591 --> 02:12:20.952]  You know, we're not going to default.
[02:12:21.012 --> 02:12:21.832]  We can print money.
[02:12:22.433 --> 02:12:23.854]  I guess in a way that's true.
[02:12:24.114 --> 02:12:25.254]  We don't have to default.
[02:12:25.394 --> 02:12:40.143]  Honestly, we could just do it dishonestly by printing money because what we end up doing when we print a lot of money is we pay off our debt and the creditors don't get any value because they get paid off with inflated currency and so they can't buy very much.
[02:12:40.183 --> 02:12:46.906]   So it's a dishonest default and that's kind of what Greenspan was referring to.
[02:12:47.267 --> 02:13:01.310]  As far as Bitcoin and gold and you know the comments Larry Fink, I know he's all of a sudden been a kind of a convert to Bitcoin because he's trying to sell the ETF that his firm manages and they get a lot of fees if people are dumb enough to buy into these ETFs.
[02:13:01.990 --> 02:13:04.931]  But I've never believed that Bitcoin was digital gold.
[02:13:05.731 --> 02:13:07.451]  That's just how they try to market it.
[02:13:08.192 --> 02:13:11.812]  But you know it doesn't have any of the actual properties of gold.
[02:13:11.892 --> 02:13:13.913]  I mean Bitcoin is no more digital gold.
[02:13:14.748 --> 02:13:16.930]  No, it's like having a photo of a Bengal tiger.
[02:13:16.789 --> 02:13:24.269]   food. I mean, you know, you can represent food on a computer, but you can't eat it.
[02:13:24.269 --> 02:13:28.750]   It doesn't have any substance. You know, if you have a diet of digital food, you're going
[02:13:28.750 --> 02:13:33.969]   to starve to death. Gold doesn't just have value because you can look at a photograph
[02:13:33.969 --> 02:13:35.469]  of it. I mean, gold is an animal.
[02:13:35.469 --> 02:13:39.668]   No, it's like having a photo of a Bengal tiger. You don't have a Bengal tiger.
[02:13:39.668 --> 02:13:43.590]  No, no. But gold is used.
[02:13:43.982 --> 02:13:45.283]  It's used in industry.
[02:13:45.343 --> 02:13:46.463]  It's used in jewelry.
[02:13:46.823 --> 02:13:49.644]  It's the most useful metal that we have.
[02:13:50.044 --> 02:13:59.066]  So it's extremely valuable based on its rare and unique properties that allow you to do things with gold that you can't do with any other metal or any other element.
[02:13:59.086 --> 02:13:59.907]  And it never ages.
[02:14:00.007 --> 02:14:01.467]  It's the only element that's eternal.
[02:14:02.611 --> 02:14:04.314]  Yes, it doesn't lose its property.
[02:14:04.334 --> 02:14:05.736]  That's why it's a store of value.
[02:14:06.037 --> 02:14:09.843]  Because all of the characteristics that are so valuable in gold...
[02:14:10.447 --> 02:14:19.213]  Those characteristics don't decay over time, meaning the gold that you have today can do just as much in a thousand years as it can now.
[02:14:19.233 --> 02:14:23.216]  In fact, probably more because they'll have more uses for it then than they do now.
[02:14:23.536 --> 02:14:28.800]  But Bitcoin won't have any use case in a thousand years because it has no use case now.
[02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:30.622]  You can't do anything with Bitcoin.
[02:14:30.822 --> 02:14:33.424]  Yes, I can give it to somebody else, but that doesn't count.
[02:14:33.444 --> 02:14:34.484]  So what is Bitcoin?
[02:14:34.564 --> 02:14:36.566]  A continual pump and dump operation?
[02:14:37.475 --> 02:14:40.957]  Yeah, it's, you know, literally, it's like a blockchain letter.
[02:14:41.158 --> 02:14:42.058]  That's really what it is.
[02:14:42.178 --> 02:14:46.982]  It's just a chain letter, you know, for the blockchain, like a pyramid or a Ponzi.
[02:14:47.002 --> 02:14:48.283]  It has all those characteristics.
[02:14:48.763 --> 02:14:49.704]  It only works.
[02:14:50.384 --> 02:14:55.327]  Sure, there's 21 million Bitcoin, which means there's 2.1 quadrillion Satoshis.
[02:14:55.648 --> 02:15:00.411]  They like to express it as the bundles because it makes it sound like it's scarcer than it is.
[02:15:00.831 --> 02:15:03.213]  But let's say there's 21 million Bitcoin.
[02:15:04.201 --> 02:15:12.127]  Sure, if a lot of people want to buy those Bitcoin because they think the price is going to go up and they think other people will pay a higher price, the price can go up.
[02:15:12.608 --> 02:15:15.010]  But what happens when people stop believing?
[02:15:15.410 --> 02:15:24.918]  Sure, it's like the tulip mania, but here's my issue, and I'm not, you're smarter than I am on money, so I'm not, you get mad at me previously because I try to research it and do interviews about it.
[02:15:25.558 --> 02:15:27.018]  But I think over time you're being proven right.
[02:15:27.679 --> 02:15:39.022]  My issue is I do want alternative independent currencies to buy gold, silver, soybeans, gasoline, guns, you know, loaves of bread, bananas, whatever.
[02:15:39.942 --> 02:15:47.544]  I see the big banks coming in and governments with their own central bank digital currencies that are totally controlled and I do want an independent currency.
[02:15:48.004 --> 02:15:48.584]  What would you say?
[02:15:48.604 --> 02:15:49.605]  That's gold or silver?
[02:15:49.625 --> 02:15:50.385]  I mean, how does that work?
[02:15:51.533 --> 02:15:52.494]  Yeah, well, absolutely.
[02:15:52.534 --> 02:15:57.758]  Well, first of all, I'm all for alternatives to government fiat money, which is a disaster.
[02:15:58.419 --> 02:16:02.902]  But what we don't need is privately created fiat digital money either.
[02:16:03.343 --> 02:16:07.406]  What the private sector can do is tokenize gold.
[02:16:07.846 --> 02:16:12.910]  I mean, gold is perfectly... I had Ron Paul's brother, Aaron Ron Paul, 20 years ago, approach me about that.
[02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:13.651]  That's a good idea.
[02:16:14.952 --> 02:16:27.123]  Yeah, because, you know, the original paper currency that was created by banks, not governments, in the United States, the banks issued paper currency notes backed by the gold that they had in their vaults.
[02:16:27.664 --> 02:16:34.550]  There's nothing that stops companies today from issuing a cryptocurrency backed by the gold that they have in their vaults.
[02:16:34.630 --> 02:16:38.474]  And that crypto-tokenized gold is far more efficient.
[02:16:38.494 --> 02:16:41.016]  But you'd be the guy to do that, and Ron Paul would get behind it.
[02:16:41.036 --> 02:16:41.657]  Why haven't you done that?
[02:16:42.850 --> 02:16:44.691]  Well, people have already done it.
[02:16:45.111 --> 02:16:51.054]  It's just that nobody really wants to use a cryptocurrency as money right now.
[02:16:51.354 --> 02:16:53.195]  They just want to get rich gambling on them.
[02:16:53.615 --> 02:17:06.862]  But I think eventually, as inflation takes hold and is a huge part of everyday life, and money is losing value, I think there'll be more incentive for people to seek out alternatives.
[02:17:07.202 --> 02:17:20.011]  To the dollar, to the euro, to the pound, and it's not Bitcoin, it's not any of these other fiat cryptocurrencies, but tokenized gold can function as a unit of account, a medium of exchange, and a store of value.
[02:17:20.111 --> 02:17:20.852]  Okay, let's stay there.
[02:17:20.892 --> 02:17:24.875]  Let's talk about tokenized silver when we come back, and give us your predictions.
[02:17:25.055 --> 02:17:34.441]  Give us your dead reckoning on what you think is coming next, the election, all the craziness, the wars, Ukraine, all of it with Peter Schiff, straight ahead, EuroPAC.com.

[02:17:39.665 --> 02:17:41.127]  We'll be right back with Peter Schiff.
[02:17:41.167 --> 02:17:41.807]  I'm Alex Jones.

[02:18:37.876 --> 02:18:41.876]  [Screaming]
[02:18:41.876 --> 02:18:46.876]   Head to InfoWarsStore.com and experience the magic of bodies for yourself.
[02:18:47.135 --> 02:18:53.619]  You know, I don't like what's happening, but at least we're ahead of it, at least we're on the wave surfing and it's not ramming us against the rocks.
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:59.722]  And we're all under attack to tell the truth, whether it's President Trump, myself, Mr. Schiff.
[02:19:00.562 --> 02:19:01.843]  But here is the bottom line.
[02:19:02.663 --> 02:19:05.805]  An old corrupt monetary system is coming to an end.
[02:19:07.032 --> 02:19:11.794]  And the WEF and the UN and all of them say, oh, we want to discredit the old system and bring in our new.
[02:19:11.814 --> 02:19:12.875]  Well, the old system's them.
[02:19:14.336 --> 02:19:20.699]  They plan to build back better on the ashes of our civilization, but they wanted to do it when no one knew that they were the architects.
[02:19:21.459 --> 02:19:22.399]  They were the mismanagers.
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:29.680]   So instead now everybody's waking up and the globalists are in trouble
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:33.899]   and their program's not working and all over the world the installed leaders
[02:19:33.899 --> 02:19:39.039]   are being removed or about to be voted out like Trudeau and the first minister of Scotland,
[02:19:39.039 --> 02:19:39.879]  all of them.
[02:19:39.879 --> 02:19:44.520]   So the globalists had convinced themselves that they could have us live under austerity
[02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:49.600]   and eat the bugs and collapses are good for the environment, but people aren't buying it.
[02:19:49.494 --> 02:19:50.575]  So now they're scared.
[02:19:50.595 --> 02:19:53.557]  I think they already had the controlled collapse plan.
[02:19:53.577 --> 02:19:57.139]  Now they're trying to paper it over and prop it up and I don't think it's working.
[02:19:57.679 --> 02:19:58.180]  That's my...
[02:19:59.230 --> 02:20:01.230]  breakdown of where we are right now.
[02:20:01.230 --> 02:20:08.460]   But I wanted to ask Peter Schiff about where he thinks it's going and the different scenarios than other big points.
[02:20:08.460 --> 02:20:11.829]   Trump, the elections, the wars, all of it, but also your bank in
[02:20:11.829 --> 02:20:14.090]  Puerto Rico. I know you wanted to talk about that.
[02:20:14.090 --> 02:20:22.140]   Yeah, well as far as where I think we're headed, I mean, I think we're headed,
[02:20:22.140 --> 02:20:26.390]   we have an inflection point where there's gonna have to be a choice between,
[02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:32.309]   you know, hyperinflation potentially or default and depression and devaluation.
[02:20:32.548 --> 02:20:34.670]  I mean, there's no easy way out.
[02:20:34.690 --> 02:20:41.996]  I mean, I've been warning about this, you know, for a long time because I can see this, you know, train wreck happening for a mile away.
[02:20:42.677 --> 02:20:45.580]  But the reality is interest rates are still too low.
[02:20:45.640 --> 02:20:47.742]  The Fed's balance sheet is still too big.
[02:20:48.202 --> 02:20:50.404]  The inflation genie is not back in the bottle.
[02:20:50.785 --> 02:20:53.207]  We need much higher interest rates, but not just that.
[02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:55.623]  I mean, we need the government to cut spending.
[02:20:55.643 --> 02:21:02.474]  The whole time that the Fed has been pretending to fight inflation, the government has continued to run larger and larger deficits.
[02:21:03.118 --> 02:21:04.779]  Meanwhile, the credit has expanded.
[02:21:04.799 --> 02:21:09.823]  Remember, inflation is not just an increase in the money supply, it's also an expansion of credit.
[02:21:10.284 --> 02:21:13.586]  And credit has been expanding the entire time the Fed raised rates.
[02:21:13.886 --> 02:21:16.268]  That's why household debt is at an all-time record high.
[02:21:16.508 --> 02:21:18.570]  That's why credit card debt is at an all-time record high.
[02:21:19.010 --> 02:21:25.435]  Nobody has stopped their borrowing and spending as a result of the Fed's rate hikes because they haven't hiked rates enough.
[02:21:26.124 --> 02:21:27.726]  And they haven't shrunk the balance sheet enough.
[02:21:27.766 --> 02:21:30.789]  There's still much too much inflation already out there.
[02:21:30.809 --> 02:21:34.734]  You know, they did QE1, QE2, QE3, the COVID QE.
[02:21:35.234 --> 02:21:36.376]  That's all inflation.
[02:21:36.476 --> 02:21:38.838]  QE is just a euphemism for inflation.
[02:21:38.919 --> 02:21:41.842]  And hasn't Ukraine been kind of a QE but they exported it?
[02:21:43.519 --> 02:21:47.661]  Well, a lot of the inflation got exported because we have trillion dollar a year trade deficit.
[02:21:48.121 --> 02:21:52.823]  But the dollars are coming back, you know, because people are starting to spend them here.
[02:21:53.804 --> 02:21:55.265]  But the inflation is there.
[02:21:55.285 --> 02:21:58.906]  I mean, it's going to take so much more to stop it.
[02:21:59.026 --> 02:22:01.587]   But in order to Stop the inflation.
[02:22:01.927 --> 02:22:05.648]  They're going to have to collapse the banking system because the banks are all insolvent.
[02:22:05.989 --> 02:22:10.990]  And if the Fed actually fights inflation, we'll have a worse financial crisis in 08.
[02:22:11.330 --> 02:22:15.931]  The government is going to have to slash spending, and it may even have to default on debt.
[02:22:16.311 --> 02:22:18.212]  But banks are going to fail.
[02:22:18.232 --> 02:22:21.753]  I mean, asset prices, stocks are going to come down, real estate is going to come down.
[02:22:22.353 --> 02:22:25.234]  In order to actually fight an inflation, it's a disaster.
[02:22:25.554 --> 02:22:26.794]  So they're not going to fight an inflation.
[02:22:26.814 --> 02:22:31.815]  Well, many experts, I want your take on this, are predicting stagflation we haven't seen since the 70s.
[02:22:31.835 --> 02:22:38.096]  For those that don't know, they thought it was impossible until then, where you have a depression in the economy, but prices still go up.
[02:22:38.196 --> 02:22:39.156]  What do you think is going to happen?
[02:22:39.977 --> 02:22:42.457]  It was impossible because they didn't understand inflation.
[02:22:42.497 --> 02:22:43.757]  They didn't understand economic.
[02:22:44.257 --> 02:22:47.338]  And then when it happened, they called it stagflation.
[02:22:48.018 --> 02:22:50.119]  It's not going to be that benign this time.
[02:22:50.279 --> 02:23:02.683]   What happened in the 70s, It's like the Sunday school picnic compared to what we're going to go through because we're in much worse shape economically than we were then.
[02:23:03.123 --> 02:23:09.967]  So if it's stagflation, the stagnation is much worse, more like depression, and the inflation is much higher.
[02:23:10.327 --> 02:23:14.149]  So we're going to get all the bad things of the 70s only on steroids.
[02:23:14.659 --> 02:23:20.845]  And we've got all these spoiled communists and people on welfare and also all the trendies that are making money off all these scams.
[02:23:21.905 --> 02:23:27.230]  I know you're an economics guy, but you're also, you know, a father and, you know, a husband, all that.
[02:23:27.811 --> 02:23:32.157]   Just as a person, I mean, look, I see Zuckerberg, not just him.
[02:23:32.678 --> 02:23:33.218]  I've studied it.
[02:23:33.258 --> 02:23:34.599]  I know some of the builders.
[02:23:35.039 --> 02:23:36.960]  I broke it a decade ago, but now it's all over the news.
[02:23:37.441 --> 02:23:45.906]  All these billionaires are building airstrips in northern Canada and bases in Tasmania and Kauai and 10-story underground bases with combat troops.
[02:23:46.307 --> 02:23:52.210]  Like, the establishment is so scared, they're building bunkers, whereas they would have just reversed this policy.
[02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.971]  They'd be safe.
[02:23:53.371 --> 02:23:54.892]  Instead, they're building these tombs for themselves.
[02:23:54.932 --> 02:23:58.855]  What do you make of the doomsday behavior of the billionaires?
[02:24:00.011 --> 02:24:02.794]  Well, you know, these guys have so much money, they don't know what to do with it.
[02:24:02.874 --> 02:24:11.201]  So who knows if it's actually prescient or it's almost become like a keep up with the billionaire Joneses, you know, who could build a bigger bunker.
[02:24:12.883 --> 02:24:13.603]  So I don't know.
[02:24:13.723 --> 02:24:17.667]  But yeah, I mean, it is something, you know, if they're if they're doing it, I mean, what do they know that we don't?
[02:24:17.727 --> 02:24:23.052]  Because you probably figured that they know a lot that we don't because they have a lot of the connections that we don't have.
[02:24:23.112 --> 02:24:25.054]  So I don't think you could dismiss what they're doing.
[02:24:25.594 --> 02:24:29.360]   But again, you know, They got so much money they don't really know what to do with it.
[02:24:29.380 --> 02:24:32.482]  They may enjoy entertaining people in their doomsday bunkers.
[02:24:33.242 --> 02:24:33.683]  Exactly.
[02:24:33.723 --> 02:24:37.025]  Maybe a giant man cave.
[02:24:37.565 --> 02:24:38.145]  Exactly.
[02:24:38.225 --> 02:24:43.608]  But, you know, as far as, you know, you mentioned my bank and, you know, it's been almost two years.
[02:24:43.708 --> 02:24:48.651]  Tomorrow it'll be 22 months since it was unnecessarily put into receivership.
[02:24:48.691 --> 02:24:51.933]  You know, the government is shutting down these banks that are insolvent.
[02:24:52.987 --> 02:24:55.249]  Uh, and then the taxpayers have to bail them out.
[02:24:55.690 --> 02:25:01.115]  Well, my bank was probably the most solvent bank in the world because it made no loans and had no debt.
[02:25:01.595 --> 02:25:06.740]  It had all the cash right there, uh, plus millions more to cover all the outstanding deposits.
[02:25:07.460 --> 02:25:13.626]  Uh, so I could have returned 100% of the deposits in any one day that the customers asked for it.
[02:25:13.706 --> 02:25:15.648]  No other bank could even come close to doing that.
[02:25:16.351 --> 02:25:36.248]   But what happened with my bank, and I don't want to say too much because now I'm really thinking about some litigation here now that I've gotten more information from my Freedom of Information Act requests, but basically Some IRS agents decided to investigate my bank because they thought it was facilitating money laundering and tax evasion.
[02:25:36.568 --> 02:25:37.769]  I don't know why they thought that.
[02:25:37.929 --> 02:25:42.271]  Maybe they just jumped to the conclusion because of my name or because of who my father was.
[02:25:42.291 --> 02:25:45.132]  So they figured, hey, this guy must be breaking the law, right?
[02:25:45.152 --> 02:25:46.153]  Look at who his dad was.
[02:25:46.733 --> 02:25:52.935]  So they opened up this big grand jury investigation of my bank, investigated it for two years, found absolutely nothing.
[02:25:54.135 --> 02:25:57.336]  It looked over thousands of accounts, found that we did nothing wrong.
[02:25:57.676 --> 02:26:01.797]  In fact, they were trying their best to find any evidence that we did anything wrong.
[02:26:02.157 --> 02:26:04.658]  And no matter how deep they dug, they found nothing.
[02:26:05.138 --> 02:26:07.379]  My bank was probably the most compliant bank.
[02:26:07.799 --> 02:26:14.106]  We had 40% of our employees worked in compliance, 30 out of 65 people just in compliance.
[02:26:14.567 --> 02:26:20.594]  We, you know, we screen people so dramatically that most people couldn't even apply from our bank.
[02:26:20.634 --> 02:26:25.219]  Oh, you're well known for keeping your nose clean, but you're saying you got politically persecuted?
[02:26:25.259 --> 02:26:27.302]  I find that, I'm joking, I find that very hard to believe.
[02:26:28.325 --> 02:26:32.028]  Yeah, but I mean, we went above and beyond.
[02:26:32.088 --> 02:26:41.857]  We turned down 75% of our applications, even after screening them, to discourage most people from even applying because they knew they couldn't get an account because we were very strict.
[02:26:41.897 --> 02:26:42.838]  So they found nothing.
[02:26:43.358 --> 02:26:54.268]  Now, about eight months into this whole thing, they illegally leaked the fact that my bank was the confidential target of this grand jury investigation to a bunch of reporters.
[02:26:54.873 --> 02:26:59.818]  And so, Australia 60 Minutes did an ambush interview, which I put up on my YouTube channel.
[02:27:00.139 --> 02:27:02.201]  Took me two years to get it and a court order.
[02:27:02.822 --> 02:27:05.024]  But I got the video interview that they did.
[02:27:05.044 --> 02:27:07.767]  They wrote an article about me.
[02:27:07.787 --> 02:27:14.294]  The New York Times wrote an article claiming that my bank was not only the target, but that it was guilty and I was the mastermind.
[02:27:14.714 --> 02:27:23.917]  Well, I sued the Australian company for defamation, took me two years, spent a million dollars, won that lawsuit that they dragged out.
[02:27:24.317 --> 02:27:37.821]  Not only did they have no evidence of any of the allegations they made, but discovery on my lawsuit proves that they lied, committed fraud, that all of their own evidence contradicted everything that they alleged that I did.
[02:27:38.221 --> 02:27:46.727]   And they doctored their own evidence, they fabricated quotes, and they actually Yeah, well I've been through that myself.
[02:27:46.606 --> 02:27:49.606]  was guilty even though they knew I was innocent.
[02:27:49.606 --> 02:27:54.325]  I've been through that myself.
[02:27:54.325 --> 02:27:58.166]   Clearly you were targeted because they don't want independent systems.
[02:27:58.166 --> 02:28:00.566]  Who knows why, but they broke the law.
[02:28:00.782 --> 02:28:03.483]  I won the defamation lawsuit in Australia.
[02:28:03.503 --> 02:28:07.266]  These guys, Nick McKenzie, Charlie Grieve, totally corrupt journalists.
[02:28:07.286 --> 02:28:08.527]  They lie, they commit fraud.
[02:28:08.827 --> 02:28:12.669]  So I won a judgment that exceeded the maximum allowable judgment.
[02:28:13.270 --> 02:28:18.873]  I actually won seven consecutive judgments against them because they put one BS defense up after another.
[02:28:19.194 --> 02:28:20.875]  And every time they put one up, I won.
[02:28:21.275 --> 02:28:23.396]  And so after seven, they finally gave up.
[02:28:23.837 --> 02:28:37.112]   But here's, the bigger part is, So after the IRS finishes their investigation and find that I did nothing wrong, I think that they were so embarrassed internally by the fact that they wasted all this time and money.
[02:28:37.725 --> 02:28:42.968]  Investigating me, got no indictments of anybody that they illegally then interfered.
[02:28:43.108 --> 02:28:50.611]  I had sold the bank because I had to sell it because that reputation had been so damaged by the false allegations that I couldn't make any money.
[02:28:50.891 --> 02:28:52.492]  So I arranged the sale of the bank.
[02:28:52.792 --> 02:28:54.033]  I had a quality U.S.
[02:28:54.073 --> 02:28:59.275]  company based in Texas, now publicly traded fintech company that was going to buy my bank.
[02:28:59.335 --> 02:29:06.779]  I had several other buyers, but I chose this bank because I thought they were, you know, the best qualified to run the bank and build it up.
[02:29:07.179 --> 02:29:08.820]  Because I wanted the bank to succeed.
[02:29:09.201 --> 02:29:10.101]  You know, I started it.
[02:29:10.161 --> 02:29:12.022]  I wanted to see it, you know, continue to grow.
[02:29:13.043 --> 02:29:15.765]  The media just made it impossible for me to do it with their lies.
[02:29:15.985 --> 02:29:17.606]  So I had the whole deal arranged.
[02:29:17.927 --> 02:29:18.687]  I had the sale.
[02:29:19.328 --> 02:29:21.209]  It was blessed by the regulators.
[02:29:21.469 --> 02:29:23.450]  They were just vetting the buyer, right?
[02:29:23.470 --> 02:29:25.692]  Just making sure they were okay going through the motions.
[02:29:26.152 --> 02:29:34.058]  And the IRS came down, illegally interfered with this sale, and convinced the local regulators to kill the sale.
[02:29:34.824 --> 02:29:37.266]  And put the bank into receivership, right?
[02:29:37.466 --> 02:29:41.948]  Shut it down, issue a cease and desist, which was done based on a mountain of lies.
[02:29:42.189 --> 02:29:47.452]  The local regulators had to tell all kinds of lies to justify this reckless action, which I can prove.
[02:29:47.792 --> 02:29:50.173]  I also can prove that the government came in and interfered.
[02:29:50.193 --> 02:30:08.867]   And they shut down the bank, and they called a press conference, and the head of the IRS, who's now in the private sector, the head of the chief, and all these guys got together and And just pretended that my bank committed the crimes that they knew that it didn't commit because they already investigated it and found I was innocent.
[02:30:09.167 --> 02:30:18.509]  So basically, in the minds of the government, the fact that they suspected me of committing a crime was just as good as me actually committing the crime.
[02:30:18.889 --> 02:30:26.151]  Well, Peter, the same things happened to me on a lower scale, where I was at a bank for 20 years, perfect record, almost no chargebacks.
[02:30:26.911 --> 02:30:31.112]  One letter from the Justice Department subpoenaing it three years ago, they drop us.
[02:30:31.820 --> 02:30:33.521]  We go to another bank, another letter.
[02:30:34.161 --> 02:30:34.681]  They drop it.
[02:30:34.881 --> 02:30:36.162]  All these grand juries open.
[02:30:36.262 --> 02:30:40.903]  I'm like, I'm not saying I'm perfect, but I'm like Mr. America, Captain America.
[02:30:40.923 --> 02:30:42.624]  I mean, I am like as straight as an arrow.
[02:30:42.644 --> 02:30:44.345]  I don't even know how to like run a scam.
[02:30:44.985 --> 02:30:48.046]  And like they did over and over again.
[02:30:48.106 --> 02:30:48.646]  It's the same.
[02:30:49.047 --> 02:30:49.867]  It's the debanking.
[02:30:49.927 --> 02:30:50.867]  It's the same harassment.
[02:30:50.887 --> 02:30:52.008]  It's going on on a mass scale.
[02:30:52.628 --> 02:30:56.409]  And now Biden's hired 80 plus thousand IRS agents.
[02:30:56.449 --> 02:30:59.110]  Now they admit AI is spying on all the things.
[02:30:59.130 --> 02:31:03.433]   Your dad famously Put in prison, knew him well, had dinner with him many times.
[02:31:03.453 --> 02:31:07.897]  He was put in jail for a book he wrote saying the IRS is a fraud.
[02:31:07.917 --> 02:31:14.022]  And if he would have just decried it and let him go, I'm kind of just doing a quick boil down here, correct me if I'm wrong, and then he died in prison.
[02:31:14.122 --> 02:31:15.323]  I mean, that is insane.
[02:31:16.164 --> 02:31:20.507]  I mean, it's a longer story, but to what your point is, it's guilt by suspicion.
[02:31:20.928 --> 02:31:24.831]  If they suspect you've done something wrong, well, that's the same thing as actually doing it wrong.
[02:31:25.131 --> 02:31:28.285]   But in my case, They didn't suspect me anymore.
[02:31:28.485 --> 02:31:33.806]  When they forced my bank out of business, they didn't suspect it did anything wrong.
[02:31:33.866 --> 02:31:37.408]  They knew it did nothing wrong because they spent two years investigating it.
[02:31:37.628 --> 02:31:42.689]  They investigated thousands of accounts, like a million documents they went over with a fine-tooth comb.
[02:31:43.009 --> 02:31:45.010]  Five governments ran over my bank.
[02:31:45.130 --> 02:31:46.130]  They couldn't find anything.
[02:31:46.211 --> 02:32:00.426]   In fact, to this date, Not only did they not find that my bank did something wrong, they haven't found a single customer, not one customer of my bank to my knowledge has ever been charged with any kind of tax or money laundering related crimes anywhere in the world!
[02:32:00.942 --> 02:32:03.544]  I mean, that's how pristine my bank was.
[02:32:03.784 --> 02:32:11.289]  But all the heads of all these governments in Australia and the UK went out and told everybody, we shut down your Pacific Bank, right?
[02:32:11.309 --> 02:32:17.753]  This is to send a message that we're tough on money laundering, tax evasion, and this, we thought this bank was helping criminals.
[02:32:17.773 --> 02:32:24.578]  But if you'd have been Mitt Romney or the Bidens, who actually, you know, got all these offshore accounts and hundreds of LLCs, you'd be just fine.
[02:32:25.526 --> 02:32:27.346]  Biden never could have done it, my bank.
[02:32:27.466 --> 02:32:31.607]  I mean, people were like, I mean, they were laundering money like crazy, the Bidens were.
[02:32:31.807 --> 02:32:37.509]  They never could have got through my KYC or AML, but all these big banks were happy to launder money for the Bidens.
[02:32:37.549 --> 02:32:39.469]  Yeah, you know, it's a double standard.
[02:32:39.929 --> 02:32:44.290]  They went after me because I'm libertarian, conservative, because I criticize the government.
[02:32:44.570 --> 02:32:51.112]  But what's more important is these government officials, you know, engaged in an illegal conspiracy to destroy my bank.
[02:32:51.492 --> 02:32:59.012]   Meanwhile, my innocent customers haven't had any of their money in almost two years and I feel really bad one customer
[02:32:59.012 --> 02:33:06.001]   very nice guy was so distraught by his you know inability to access his life savings and the
[02:33:06.001 --> 02:33:09.612]   financial stress that a couple weeks ago, two, three weeks ago he committed
[02:33:09.612 --> 02:33:10.132]  suicide.
[02:33:10.132 --> 02:33:13.132]  Wow.
[02:33:13.132 --> 02:33:16.812]   Well as bad as this is Peter, imagine when the social credit score
[02:33:16.812 --> 02:33:21.011]   central bank digital currency goes in and they're openly surveilling with AI.
[02:33:21.118 --> 02:33:21.879]  They're already doing it.
[02:33:21.899 --> 02:33:29.445]  I'm sure you've seen the revelations, even Fox News, that they have AI with the NSA watching everything illegally.
[02:33:29.865 --> 02:33:31.387]  Imagine that hell world.
[02:33:33.115 --> 02:33:36.556]  Oh, well look, yeah, I mean, it's gonna get a lot worse.
[02:33:36.616 --> 02:33:47.800]  And I know there are people like on Twitter, you know, they, you know, because I've been putting out a lot of stuff recently on the bank as I found out new information about, you know, the deal to shut it down three months before they did it with the IRS.
[02:33:50.660 --> 02:33:51.941]  It's much bigger than just me.
[02:33:52.401 --> 02:33:58.024]   Because I'm just focusing, if there's this kind of corruption in the government, And they can do it to me and get away with it.
[02:33:58.044 --> 02:33:59.346]  Well, they can do it to anybody, right?
[02:33:59.386 --> 02:34:00.567]  These guys can do whatever they want.
[02:34:00.587 --> 02:34:03.430]  I can't get into it yet, but the same stuff's going on here right now.
[02:34:05.031 --> 02:34:07.974]  Yeah, I mean, you know, we're not a nation of laws anymore.
[02:34:08.094 --> 02:34:11.458]  You know, we're a nation of men who are above the law, and they do whatever they want.
[02:34:12.219 --> 02:34:17.425]  You know, and you can even see that with all these sham cases built up all around against Trump.
[02:34:17.485 --> 02:34:18.446]  That was my next question.
[02:34:18.506 --> 02:34:20.048]  Trump, let's move out of money.
[02:34:20.468 --> 02:34:25.694]  Trump, the election, Ukraine, Israel, Soros funding all these protests.
[02:34:25.934 --> 02:34:28.457]  You can see them trying to turn the temperature up to a thousand.
[02:34:30.382 --> 02:34:35.466]  Oh yeah, and you remember, you know, I thought Trump was going to win in 2016 when he won.
[02:34:35.847 --> 02:34:51.660]  And the reason I thought he was going to win is his message was resonating because he was leveling with the American public about how lousy things were and they were being spoon-fed a bunch of lies from the Obama administration and then Hillary about how great everything was.
[02:34:51.900 --> 02:34:57.885]  And Trump felt their pain and said, I know it's bad and I'm going to make America great again if you elect me.
[02:34:58.665 --> 02:35:00.246]  And a lot of people voted for him.
[02:35:00.726 --> 02:35:10.709]  And the economy is in worse shape now than it was then, and they're getting the same lies from the establishment, the media, the Democrats, Wall Street, and the public knows.
[02:35:10.969 --> 02:35:15.691]  You know, look at Trump's popularity with African-Americans.
[02:35:15.971 --> 02:35:20.152]  He's going to get more African-American votes than any modern Republican.
[02:35:20.692 --> 02:35:22.593]  It's got to be 50% now on real numbers.
[02:35:22.813 --> 02:35:26.214]  I mean, I don't know any black people, I know a lot of them, that don't totally support Trump.
[02:35:27.634 --> 02:35:29.475]  Yeah, I mean, but the thing is, but why?
[02:35:29.615 --> 02:35:31.595]  I mean, and they're painting them as a racist too.
[02:35:32.036 --> 02:35:48.901]  You know, the reason that African Americans, especially men, men even more so than women, but the reason African Americans are supporting Trump in record numbers is because disproportionately they're feeling the pain more in this economy, the Biden economy.
[02:35:49.101 --> 02:35:50.822]  They're suffering more from higher rents.
[02:35:51.062 --> 02:35:53.003]  They're suffering more from higher food prices.
[02:35:53.263 --> 02:35:56.284]  They're struggling more with low paid multiple jobs.
[02:35:56.404 --> 02:36:05.747]   So, you know, They're living in reality, not this fantasy that Wall Street or the Biden administration is trying to create and cram down their throats.
[02:36:06.087 --> 02:36:10.889]  And so they want an alternative, and they see Trump as the best alternative they have.
[02:36:12.580 --> 02:36:17.343]  The industrialization of harassment of just populists and people that aren't criminals is insane.
[02:36:18.523 --> 02:36:19.324]  Here's the paradox.
[02:36:20.244 --> 02:36:26.588]  I don't see how the corrupt system gets out of this, but I don't see them stopping and then just wrecking everything to try to keep control.
[02:36:26.988 --> 02:36:28.749]  So I think we're in a pyrrhic victory here.
[02:36:28.769 --> 02:36:32.231]  I think we're going to win, but I think society is going to be destroyed in the process.
[02:36:32.251 --> 02:36:37.734]  When you say this is going to make the Great Depression look tame, I at a gut level agree with you.
[02:36:37.754 --> 02:36:39.014]  We can all feel the danger.
[02:36:39.475 --> 02:36:41.716]  We can intellectually see it, but I'm really concerned.
[02:36:42.985 --> 02:36:46.648]  You look back, I mean, America was a much more civil nation in the 1930s.
[02:36:46.728 --> 02:36:52.012]  I mean, people had much greater respect for the law, respect for themselves.
[02:36:52.072 --> 02:37:00.518]  In fact, even when Roosevelt, you know, introduced relief, you know, which was the first welfare during the 1930s, a lot of Americans had too much pride to take it.
[02:37:01.138 --> 02:37:04.521]  And a lot of people who took it paid it back, just morally.
[02:37:04.761 --> 02:37:08.844]  So, you know, we had a much stronger sense of purpose, sense of self.
[02:37:08.884 --> 02:37:10.045]  We were rugged individuals.
[02:37:10.065 --> 02:37:11.546]  Well, they knew there's no free lunch.
[02:37:12.785 --> 02:37:16.147]  Well, yeah, now we have a nation of people who feel entitled to free stuff.
[02:37:16.347 --> 02:37:19.890]  They think, you know, that it's their birthright to get stuff for nothing.
[02:37:20.010 --> 02:37:22.292]  And when they don't get it, they're going to react.
[02:37:22.312 --> 02:37:23.572]  They're going to riot.
[02:37:23.612 --> 02:37:24.293]  They're going to loot.
[02:37:24.313 --> 02:37:28.556]  They're going to, you know, they're going to protest in the streets because somehow they're not getting.
[02:37:29.036 --> 02:37:29.496]  And I agree.
[02:37:29.557 --> 02:37:30.197]  So let me ask you that.
[02:37:30.317 --> 02:37:33.719]  Huge Hollywood movies, TV shows, professors.
[02:37:33.739 --> 02:37:35.461]  Oh, civil war is coming.
[02:37:35.501 --> 02:37:36.241]  Trump's going to trigger it.
[02:37:36.281 --> 02:37:40.104]  No, the left's going to have an uprising during the financial crisis.
[02:37:40.124 --> 02:37:41.725]  They're going to call that a civil war.
[02:37:42.950 --> 02:37:47.672]  Yeah, you know, there's always kind of fear-mongering about, look, that's how the Democrats operate.
[02:37:47.692 --> 02:37:50.453]  Look, that's what they did against Barry Goldwater with Lyndon Johnson.
[02:37:50.713 --> 02:37:52.074]  Oh, don't vote for Barry Goldwater.
[02:37:52.114 --> 02:37:53.995]  You're going to have a nuclear war, right?
[02:37:54.055 --> 02:37:57.796]  And anyway, so we voted for Lyndon Johnson and then we had the Vietnam War.
[02:37:58.056 --> 02:38:00.438]  You know, Barry Goldwater probably would have kept us out of that war.
[02:38:00.458 --> 02:38:05.100]  So they've been campaigning on these lies, you know, for a long time.
[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:07.340]   But in the meantime, We've got to prepare.
[02:38:07.480 --> 02:38:08.060]  I mean, it's good.
[02:38:08.461 --> 02:38:11.821]  The first thing is protecting your wealth, protecting your finances.
[02:38:11.861 --> 02:38:13.342]  I mean, I mentioned tokenized gold.
[02:38:13.882 --> 02:38:15.442]  The time for that is going to come.
[02:38:15.822 --> 02:38:17.503]  Right now, you've got to get the real thing.
[02:38:17.623 --> 02:38:29.126]  You've got to go and buy actual gold and silver just to store it, to preserve wealth, to get out of the fiat monetary system, to get out of the banking system, and to have your savings protected.
[02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:33.073]  Because normally I look at gold and silver as just a way to store wealth.
[02:38:34.294 --> 02:38:41.379]  But now, the metals are so underpriced right now because the perception does not match the reality.
[02:38:41.660 --> 02:38:43.321]  People think we have 2% inflation.
[02:38:43.361 --> 02:38:43.741]  We don't.
[02:38:44.082 --> 02:38:47.244]  We have more like 20% inflation in the future, maybe much higher.
[02:38:47.584 --> 02:38:49.806]  So gold is not priced for that reality.
[02:38:50.086 --> 02:38:53.409]  Gold should be $10,000, $20,000 an ounce, maybe more.
[02:38:53.469 --> 02:38:54.790]  Who knows where silver should be?
[02:38:55.131 --> 02:38:57.352]  But right now it's very cheap, so people should buy it.
[02:38:57.532 --> 02:38:59.114]  I've got my company, Shift Gold.
[02:38:59.453 --> 02:39:02.413]  My last name, Shivgold.com.
[02:39:02.413 --> 02:39:03.773]  That's one place that you can get it.
[02:39:03.773 --> 02:39:07.653]   We make sure that people don't overpay for their gold and silver.
[02:39:07.653 --> 02:39:13.273]   But you wanna have your silver and gold and keep it yourself, control it, store it yourself.
[02:39:13.273 --> 02:39:21.533]   In closing, you don't like to speculate, but they just keep gobbling down on Trump.
[02:39:21.516 --> 02:39:23.658]  So it's the immovable object with the unstoppable force.
[02:39:24.118 --> 02:39:25.119]  What do you think is going to happen?
[02:39:25.179 --> 02:39:31.323]  Gut level, if you're sitting around dinner with your wife, she says, hey, what do you think is going to happen, Peter?
[02:39:31.923 --> 02:39:32.804]  What do you say to your wife?
[02:39:32.824 --> 02:39:33.964]  What do you say to one of your children?
[02:39:33.984 --> 02:39:36.246]  What do you say to your neighbor when you're sitting around having dinner?
[02:39:37.487 --> 02:39:42.750]  Yeah, it's hard for me to get a word in as wise when my wife starts talking.
[02:39:42.950 --> 02:39:44.751]  She's a big fan of yours, by the way, Alex.
[02:39:47.826 --> 02:39:55.230]  Maybe one day you can join us for dinner and I'll be the odd man out as you guys go into all these different theories that she's in.
[02:39:56.391 --> 02:39:59.472]  But, you know, I don't know.
[02:39:59.512 --> 02:40:07.897]  It's going to be interesting to see how it plays out if they end up getting any kind of conviction of Trump on any one of these charges between now and the election.
[02:40:08.157 --> 02:40:10.198]  Look, I thought he was going to lose.
[02:40:11.119 --> 02:40:30.505]   In 2020 because he hadn't really accomplished a lot of what he thought and I might have been wrong maybe he actually won that election who the hell knows you know but I'm pretty sure he's gonna win this one now I think the only hope the Democrats have Of Trump not winning, even if he's in jail, I think he wins from jail.
[02:40:30.806 --> 02:40:35.529]  If they put him in jail, he could win from a jail cell if he's running against Biden.
[02:40:35.809 --> 02:40:40.052]  So I think the only chance they have is they got to get rid of Biden and they got to get rid of Harris.
[02:40:40.092 --> 02:40:44.715]  They both have to go and they have to somehow find an alternative.
[02:40:46.005 --> 02:40:48.027]  That the voters will accept.
[02:40:48.627 --> 02:40:50.068]  So I think that's a big... No, I agree.
[02:40:50.088 --> 02:40:52.129]  We're going to change candidates up at the convention.
[02:40:52.850 --> 02:40:53.190]  Totally agree.
[02:40:53.210 --> 02:40:54.371]  Well, join us again soon.

[02:42:59.254 --> 02:43:03.495]  You can see here the Great Awakening orbiting the Great Reset.
[02:43:04.216 --> 02:43:13.958]  Although the depopulation systems of the Great Reset are not yet fully operational, the Great Reset does have a strong conspiracy network.
[02:43:14.398 --> 02:43:20.299]  It is protected by a satanic shield, which can be disabled by the Great Awakening.
[02:43:20.699 --> 02:43:26.901]  The Great Reset must be deactivated if any victory for humanity is to be accomplished.
[02:43:27.964 --> 02:43:41.991]  Once the Great Awakening deactivates the shield, InfoWars.com forward slash show will cover the truth while Info Warriors fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the Great Reset.
[02:43:42.492 --> 02:43:46.214]  Alex Jones has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.

[02:44:00.651 --> 02:44:03.813]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalists.
[02:44:03.853 --> 02:44:06.755]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.

[02:44:53.476 --> 02:45:00.277]   Great being on the Alex Jones Show, one of my favorite shows. I love what InfoWars does.
[02:45:00.277 --> 02:45:08.197]   And everything you can do to support them, please put your money where your heart is, because
[02:45:08.197 --> 02:45:16.436]   we are in dangerous times and all they're doing is shutting down truth and freedom.
[02:45:16.436 --> 02:45:26.437]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:45:17.573 --> 02:45:19.013]  You gotta believe what we tell you.
[02:45:19.033 --> 02:45:22.835]  If you don't believe what we tell you, you believe in misinformation.
[02:45:23.796 --> 02:45:26.977]  Which, by the way, I find sexist to call it misinformation.
[02:45:26.997 --> 02:45:28.798]  We should call it, uh, trans information.
[02:45:29.038 --> 02:45:30.719]  You believe in trans information.
[02:45:32.978 --> 02:45:34.758]  Yeah, I mean, it's just disgusting.
[02:45:36.179 --> 02:45:39.900]  Anyway, so do what you could do to support InfoWars.
[02:45:39.940 --> 02:45:41.220]  We're in critical times.
[02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:47.322]  One of our top trends for 2024 is banks go bust.
[02:45:48.822 --> 02:45:51.043]  Barely, barely reporting on it.
[02:45:52.463 --> 02:45:53.623]  No one's talking about it.
[02:45:53.643 --> 02:45:54.343]  They're afraid.
[02:45:56.284 --> 02:45:58.925]  This isn't like selling hysteria.
[02:45:58.965 --> 02:46:00.345]  These are selling facts.
[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:09.763]  The banks are going to go bust for the very simple reason of understanding trend forecasting.
[02:46:10.443 --> 02:46:16.966]  Tracking trends is the understanding of where we are and how we got here to see where we're going.
[02:46:18.586 --> 02:46:20.187]  So why are the banks going bust?
[02:46:24.029 --> 02:46:38.194]   They're going bust because they launched a COVID war In January 2020, in China, to celebrate the Year of the Rat.
[02:46:40.955 --> 02:46:41.455]  Go home!
[02:46:41.495 --> 02:46:42.475]  You can't go to work!
[02:46:42.775 --> 02:46:43.116]  All right?
[02:46:43.236 --> 02:46:44.916]  We've gone over this a thousand times.
[02:46:48.278 --> 02:47:02.588]   So people are now saying, as they're waking up at 8 o'clock in the morning, or 7 o'clock rather than 5 o'clock, As they're working from home, they say, I'm getting up at 5, 5.30 in the morning to commute an hour and a half each way.
[02:47:03.868 --> 02:47:04.589]  I'm not doing that.
[02:47:06.489 --> 02:47:07.149]  I'm not going to do it.
[02:47:08.550 --> 02:47:12.011]  And the people that are renting the office spaces, yeah, stay home.
[02:47:12.631 --> 02:47:13.472]  I don't see anyway.
[02:47:13.632 --> 02:47:14.592]  You're in a cubicle.
[02:47:17.453 --> 02:47:19.994]  Again, these are the numbers put out in the facts.
[02:47:20.034 --> 02:47:21.234]  They're in the Trends Journal.
[02:47:21.274 --> 02:47:22.375]  We quote the sources.
[02:47:24.375 --> 02:47:27.789]   In San Francisco, And they were the first to lock down.
[02:47:27.809 --> 02:47:36.114]  The geeks, yeah, really brought their business up, didn't they?
[02:47:36.134 --> 02:47:41.857]  36% vacancy rate, meaning nobody there.
[02:47:41.977 --> 02:47:43.818]  It's about 36.5 or something.
[02:47:44.878 --> 02:47:46.119]  Nobody in the buildings, empty.
[02:47:46.819 --> 02:47:56.020]  Before the COVID war in 2019, the vacancy rate was 3.6%.
[02:47:56.293 --> 02:47:58.074]  Now it's almost 37%.
[02:47:58.414 --> 02:48:04.219]  There's going to be massive bank failures.
[02:48:04.879 --> 02:48:11.645]  And what happened on Friday, barely reported, buried in the papers.
[02:48:14.327 --> 02:48:21.052]  One site I always suggest people go to if you want to know the banking trends is Wall Street on Parade.
[02:48:22.987 --> 02:48:29.791]  Quietly on Friday, the FDIC announced the first federally insured bank failure of 2024.
[02:48:30.412 --> 02:48:31.592]  Oh, you didn't know that, huh?
[02:48:32.033 --> 02:48:33.393]  Yeah, I guess nobody's talking about it.
[02:48:34.834 --> 02:48:41.178]  The publicly traded Republic First Bank Corp., which did business as Republic Bank.
[02:48:43.599 --> 02:48:48.783]  It's just like as the Republic of America's gone down the toilet, so too is the Republic Bank.
[02:48:50.904 --> 02:48:55.045]   In an unsettling sign, Of the times.
[02:48:56.706 --> 02:49:00.688]  The Federally Insured Bank was trading at one cent on Friday.
[02:49:02.169 --> 02:49:02.369]  Yep.
[02:49:03.130 --> 02:49:05.911]  So it made no sense to put a penny in it.
[02:49:06.031 --> 02:49:07.172]  But how about all the money lost?
[02:49:07.532 --> 02:49:08.793]  This is just the beginning.
[02:49:09.373 --> 02:49:11.655]  And we come back with go into details again.
[02:49:12.936 --> 02:49:17.598]  This is going to drive gold prices through the roof and it may very well crash.
[02:49:17.618 --> 02:49:21.381]  The economy and the stock markets.
[02:49:22.665 --> 02:49:23.665]  So stay tuned.
[02:49:24.145 --> 02:49:26.026]  Remember, support InfoWars.
[02:49:26.566 --> 02:49:28.827]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:49:28.887 --> 02:49:33.768]  And as I said, get ready, get ready for the banks to go bust.
[02:49:34.508 --> 02:49:35.908]  Hardly being reported.
[02:49:36.088 --> 02:49:37.229]  We only give you the facts.
[02:49:38.729 --> 02:49:42.490]  And then we give you our trends analysis and our trend forecasts.
[02:49:43.150 --> 02:49:44.831]  And you get those in your Trends Journal.
[02:49:44.971 --> 02:49:55.522]   You go to TrendsJournal.com and you put in Jones Trends Go to jonestrends.com and you get 10% off.
[02:49:55.562 --> 02:49:57.904]  The grand total of $2.50 a week.
[02:49:59.105 --> 02:49:59.586]  So anyway.
[02:50:01.687 --> 02:50:04.190]  Yeah, again, we're giving you what nobody else in the world is giving you.
[02:50:04.210 --> 02:50:05.791]  There's no magazine that comes close to it.
[02:50:05.851 --> 02:50:07.432]  Nothing.
[02:50:07.472 --> 02:50:08.833]  Anyway, going back to the banks.
[02:50:09.914 --> 02:50:10.655]  See, here's the deal.
[02:50:14.218 --> 02:50:30.260]   There's some $4 trillion worth of commercial real estate debt coming due In the next two and a half years, there's going to be defaults that are beyond the imagination.
[02:50:34.163 --> 02:50:45.312]  There's no way that the office building owners are going to be able to pay off their debt when they're losing tenants.
[02:50:47.594 --> 02:50:48.995]  This isn't rocket science.
[02:50:51.448 --> 02:50:58.090]  The banks got a ton of dough when they started the COVID war back in 2020.
[02:50:58.610 --> 02:51:00.570]  Hey, stay home.
[02:51:01.471 --> 02:51:02.191]  Don't go to work.
[02:51:02.231 --> 02:51:03.031]  Here's free money.
[02:51:03.071 --> 02:51:06.812]  Hey, all you guys in businesses that we're locking down, here's a couple of bucks.
[02:51:07.332 --> 02:51:08.012]  Shut your mouth.
[02:51:08.912 --> 02:51:11.193]  So now a load of money went into the banks.
[02:51:12.353 --> 02:51:13.814]  So what'd the banks do with that money?
[02:51:13.874 --> 02:51:16.334]  Well, they got to do a safe bet on it.
[02:51:16.734 --> 02:51:17.795]  So they bought treasuries.
[02:51:18.855 --> 02:51:19.015]  Yeah.
[02:51:20.202 --> 02:51:23.603]  They bought treasuries when interest rates were at zero.
[02:51:23.623 --> 02:51:28.604]  And now those treasuries are selling for 5%.
[02:51:31.445 --> 02:51:33.626]  So they got all this worthless money.
[02:51:33.646 --> 02:51:37.467]  They're not going to be able to cover their debt.
[02:51:39.087 --> 02:51:39.928]  From the losses.
[02:51:41.688 --> 02:51:42.548]  From the defaults.
[02:51:44.189 --> 02:51:45.089]  They're going to go bust.
[02:51:46.109 --> 02:51:47.370]  Just like this bank did.
[02:51:47.990 --> 02:51:48.210]  Again.
[02:51:49.679 --> 02:51:50.779]  Barely reported.
[02:51:51.420 --> 02:52:00.083]  It was reported on the next to last page of the Wall Street Journal on Saturday.
[02:52:02.904 --> 02:52:15.109]  And by the way, when you read the Wall Street Journal's overview of the last week, they no longer, they barely ever talk about what the markets did in Asia or Europe.
[02:52:15.209 --> 02:52:15.909]  They don't count.
[02:52:18.160 --> 02:52:39.745]  So going back to the banks going bust, it's not only the commercial real estate, the office buildings, it's all the businesses that are going out of business because commuters aren't commuting like they used to.
[02:52:40.546 --> 02:52:42.946]  It's a totally different world.
[02:52:43.566 --> 02:52:49.466]   There are some hot spots here and there, but Businesses are going bust.
[02:52:50.267 --> 02:52:51.708]  Restaurants are closing up.
[02:52:53.068 --> 02:52:54.569]  The good old days are over.
[02:52:57.691 --> 02:53:04.215]  So, then you look at your office occupancy rate, meaning how many people go into the office.
[02:53:05.917 --> 02:53:09.379]  According to Castle Systems, that's with a K, it's about 51%.
[02:53:09.238 --> 02:53:21.798]  51%. That's right. 51%. So this is real.
[02:53:21.793 --> 02:53:22.734]  It's going to hit hard.
[02:53:24.135 --> 02:53:26.277]  And now you're seeing the numbers come out.
[02:53:26.977 --> 02:53:31.120]  Oh, the inflation numbers when it came out last week, they were higher than expected.
[02:53:33.422 --> 02:53:34.102]  Not by us.
[02:53:36.364 --> 02:53:36.624]  But.
[02:53:39.406 --> 02:53:43.109]  The good news is the GDP came, well, that was down to.
[02:53:43.129 --> 02:53:46.612]  Inflation up, GDP down.
[02:53:49.107 --> 02:53:50.827]  They're calling it stagflation.
[02:53:51.268 --> 02:53:53.008]  It's not going to be stagflation.
[02:53:53.888 --> 02:53:57.289]  When this crisis hits, it's going to be dragflation.
[02:53:58.169 --> 02:54:00.230]  It's not going to be a stagnant economy.
[02:54:00.650 --> 02:54:04.891]  It's going to be one that goes down as inflation goes up.
[02:54:09.532 --> 02:54:10.492]  Facts are all here.
[02:54:10.512 --> 02:54:16.234]  The cost of buying a home has hit an all-time high.
[02:54:18.615 --> 02:54:20.557]  Yep, this is according to Redfin.
[02:54:20.577 --> 02:54:27.402]  The median home price hit a record $383,725 during the four-week break ending April 21st.
[02:54:27.482 --> 02:54:29.244]  That's up 5.2% from a year ago.
[02:54:29.063 --> 02:54:38.863]   hundred and twenty-five dollars during the four-week break ending April 21st.
[02:54:38.863 --> 02:54:46.742]  That's up 5.2 percent from a year ago.
[02:54:46.742 --> 02:54:52.223]  Now let's look at your median household income.
[02:54:52.677 --> 02:55:00.378]  So we're talking about the median home price is at nearly $384,000 and your median household income is around $75,000.
[02:55:00.217 --> 02:55:15.217]   is that nearly $384,000 and your median household income, household income, is around $75,000.
[02:55:15.217 --> 02:55:16.817]  You're not going to be able to buy a house.
[02:55:16.817 --> 02:55:24.297]   But don't worry about it because the rich are getting richer.
[02:55:24.297 --> 02:55:26.297]  Thank you for watching.
[02:55:25.846 --> 02:55:29.307]  And all we become a plantation workers of slave land.
[02:55:33.449 --> 02:55:34.669]  So you're going to see price.
[02:55:36.429 --> 02:55:40.271]  Is going to cool down a bit in the coming months.
[02:55:44.392 --> 02:55:44.532]  If.
[02:55:46.072 --> 02:55:48.293]  We don't see the mortgage rates going down.
[02:55:49.794 --> 02:55:51.314]  So that goes to the next question.
[02:55:52.301 --> 02:55:55.162]  What are they going to do with the interest rates?
[02:55:56.203 --> 02:56:05.447]  Again, going back to the office building bust, when they bought these buildings, the interest rates were half of what they are now.
[02:56:06.907 --> 02:56:14.907]   And now we got inflation going up, so they say the central banks aren't going to lower the interest rates.
[02:56:14.907 --> 02:56:24.907]  Any way this thing goes, it goes down.
[02:56:24.823 --> 02:56:41.290]  But again, on the housing market, what differentiates this one from the bust that happened in 2008, and again, the Trends Journal took out the domain name, Panic of 08 in November 2007.
[02:56:41.390 --> 02:56:49.314]  What's different about this is, back then, people couldn't afford to buy their home.
[02:56:50.515 --> 02:56:51.335]  Hey, you don't have a job?
[02:56:51.375 --> 02:56:52.276]  Don't worry about it.
[02:56:52.296 --> 02:56:53.616]  Here's a subprime mortgage.
[02:56:53.996 --> 02:56:54.857]  I'm Jamie Dimon.
[02:56:54.877 --> 02:56:55.537]  Do what you want.
[02:56:57.698 --> 02:56:58.478]  You're deep in debt?
[02:56:58.498 --> 02:56:59.498]  Don't worry about it.
[02:56:59.538 --> 02:57:01.299]  Here, sign over here.
[02:57:01.419 --> 02:57:02.199]  Subprime mortgage.
[02:57:02.219 --> 02:57:02.939]  You buy a house.
[02:57:04.680 --> 02:57:05.320]  This is different.
[02:57:06.661 --> 02:57:10.562]  Yes, prices may go down a bit, but they're still going to go high.
[02:57:12.443 --> 02:57:16.804]  And real estate is still going to be a good investment in certain areas.
[02:57:17.144 --> 02:57:18.685]  And we don't give financial advice.
[02:57:19.980 --> 02:57:35.126]  But I can say this on a personal level, that real estate investment in the right places at the right time, to me, has been very, very beneficial.
[02:57:36.567 --> 02:57:46.731]  And I bought three of the most historic buildings in America at the bottom.
[02:57:48.976 --> 02:57:52.978]  In 2012, up here in Kingston, New York.
[02:57:53.558 --> 02:58:04.904]  Google up, uh, all those four corners in America, Kingston, New York, and you'll see the four buildings.
[02:58:06.785 --> 02:58:07.686]  I own three of them.
[02:58:07.726 --> 02:58:12.708]  The others are museum.
[02:58:12.728 --> 02:58:15.950]  And I bought them at the bottom.
[02:58:16.310 --> 02:58:18.031]  I bought one in foreclosure.
[02:58:21.391 --> 02:58:34.397]  Now, Kingston has become the hotspot as people are leaving New York because the women and men and kids don't want to get smashed in the face, robbed.
[02:58:36.217 --> 02:58:41.760]  They don't want to be around tons of homeless people and migrants.
[02:58:44.361 --> 02:58:46.862]  So they're flooding out into the exports.
[02:58:48.459 --> 02:58:49.519]  Beyond the suburbs.
[02:58:49.659 --> 02:58:53.801]  Suburbs are still too expensive, but the ex-burbs, you could afford more.
[02:58:57.162 --> 02:59:00.583]  So these are the things you need to look at if you're going to be investing.
[02:59:02.303 --> 02:59:10.666]  And on the gold line, again, I can see gold going to $3,000 an ounce this year.
[02:59:12.146 --> 02:59:17.968]  What's going to make the difference is when they begin to lower interest rates, they're going to do it at some point.
[02:59:19.326 --> 02:59:25.129]  And we believe they're going to lower them in the run-up to the presidential reality show in November.
[02:59:25.169 --> 02:59:26.389]  And that's all it is to me.
[02:59:26.429 --> 02:59:27.670]  It's a reality show.
[02:59:28.851 --> 02:59:32.372]  I know you got your own people that you like.
[02:59:32.432 --> 02:59:33.373]  I don't like any of them.
[02:59:36.954 --> 02:59:39.676]  They want to keep the people in power in power.
[02:59:40.696 --> 02:59:48.574]   Again, our former Fed head, Janet Yellen, Is now our Treasury Secretary?
[02:59:48.634 --> 02:59:49.235]  You got it?
[02:59:49.255 --> 02:59:50.616]  You see who's running the show?
[02:59:50.636 --> 02:59:52.977]  The banksters.
[02:59:56.659 --> 02:59:57.760]  They want to keep her there.
[02:59:57.780 --> 03:00:01.502]  They're going to lower interest rates.
[03:00:01.583 --> 03:00:05.645]  The lower interest rates go, the deeper the dollar falls.
[03:00:06.646 --> 03:00:10.388]  The deeper the dollar falls, the higher gold prices go.
[03:00:11.269 --> 03:00:17.268]   Because it's cheaper to buy gold In other currencies was the value.
[03:00:18.368 --> 03:00:30.553]  And again, we've been putting all the data in your Trends Journal about how the Chinese are buying it up like crazy.
[03:00:31.834 --> 03:00:37.856]  And on the other end of the market is the what's going to happen with oil prices.
[03:00:39.057 --> 03:00:51.809]   And now the news is that Oil prices fall more than 1% as Secretary of State Lincoln pushes for Gaza ceasefire.
[03:00:52.629 --> 03:00:55.449]  Oh, Lincoln's pushing for Gaza ceasefire?
[03:00:55.469 --> 03:01:04.872]  You mean after the United States, let's see, three UN ceasefire agreements that the United States vetoed?
[03:01:05.312 --> 03:01:06.972]  Are you waiting until now to do it?
[03:01:09.953 --> 03:01:10.873]  This is from CNBC.
[03:01:11.952 --> 03:01:15.393]  Crude oil futures fell by $1 on Monday as U.S.
[03:01:15.433 --> 03:01:19.055]  Secretary of State made a renewed diplomatic push.
[03:01:19.075 --> 03:01:20.615]  He's a dip-low-mat.
[03:01:21.195 --> 03:01:23.976]  He's a dip-low-on-the-mat.
[03:01:26.377 --> 03:01:26.998]  Diplomat.
[03:01:27.158 --> 03:01:28.518]  What a bunch of crap.
[03:01:28.878 --> 03:01:30.319]  This arrogant clown.
[03:01:31.879 --> 03:01:34.820]  My daddy was an ambassador to Hungary.
[03:01:34.941 --> 03:01:35.621]  I went to Dalton.
[03:01:35.701 --> 03:01:36.461]  I went to Harvard.
[03:01:36.781 --> 03:01:38.762]  My uncle was ambassador to Belgium.
[03:01:40.385 --> 03:01:42.486]  I've been in the club forever.
[03:01:42.926 --> 03:01:44.247]  You're just a nobody.
[03:01:44.347 --> 03:01:46.148]  I'm Anthony Blinken.
[03:01:48.229 --> 03:02:04.678]  All the damn money you people, I can't use the proper word, slimeballs, said to keep ramping up the genocide in front of everybody's eyes, and now you're calling for a ceasefire?
[03:02:07.120 --> 03:02:09.361]  You got Lockjaw all those other times?
[03:02:13.812 --> 03:02:21.719]  Anyway, a successful ceasefire agreement will likely further ease the geopolitical risk premium factor into oil prices.
[03:02:23.240 --> 03:02:25.562]  So, very, very true.
[03:02:27.664 --> 03:02:28.525]  And very important.
[03:02:31.187 --> 03:02:33.269]  Because that'll ease things a lot.
[03:02:33.429 --> 03:02:35.711]  And by the way, that'll bring down gold prices.
[03:02:36.913 --> 03:02:39.134]  You gotta watch what you, it's not what you want, it's what is.
[03:02:41.215 --> 03:02:43.896]  And gold prices will come down.
[03:02:45.336 --> 03:02:46.577]  If there's a ceasefire.
[03:02:47.757 --> 03:02:52.359]  But again, the downside of gold could be another hundred bucks.
[03:02:53.999 --> 03:02:56.220]  But you're still over 2,000 an ounce.
[03:02:57.481 --> 03:03:03.483]  And it's up over what about 600 well over 600% since the beginning of the millennium.
[03:03:04.823 --> 03:03:11.410]   So going on to What's going on with the ceasefire?
[03:03:11.430 --> 03:03:14.472]  This is this is important.
[03:03:16.233 --> 03:03:26.019]  It's also important because it'll ease the pressures that are happening now with all of these protests going on in colleges.
[03:03:28.761 --> 03:03:29.501]  And.
[03:03:31.643 --> 03:03:33.944]  This is it's big.
[03:03:35.174 --> 03:03:42.376]  I was on this show, what a two little jerks, I don't know, I said to my assistant, we gotta be more careful who I go along with.
[03:03:42.396 --> 03:03:51.999]  It was this past Saturday, over there in the UK, a James Wales whale, looks like a whale.
[03:03:54.520 --> 03:04:02.462]  And they start off by saying, they were bringing me on to talk about what's going on in Gaza.
[03:04:06.283 --> 03:04:17.387]  And the first question is, he said, well, you know, there's a lot of problems going over there in America and with all these anti-Semitic college protests.
[03:04:17.407 --> 03:04:20.208]  I said, they're not anti-Semitic.
[03:04:23.209 --> 03:04:23.869]  He said, yes, they are.
[03:04:23.909 --> 03:04:24.809]  I said, no, they're not.
[03:04:25.049 --> 03:04:28.030]  I said, they're protesting against the war.
[03:04:28.050 --> 03:04:33.592]  And by the way, we just had one over here in front of Congressman Pat Ryan.
[03:04:34.224 --> 03:04:38.305]  Who's up here in Kingston on Sunday.
[03:04:40.226 --> 03:04:41.887]  And there are a lot of people out there.
[03:04:41.907 --> 03:04:49.309]  But again, you know, these things are important.
[03:04:49.349 --> 03:04:50.790]  You say, well, they don't mean anything.
[03:04:50.850 --> 03:04:51.830]  I said, yes, they do.
[03:04:52.770 --> 03:04:55.031]  I said, I grew up during the Vietnam War.
[03:04:55.471 --> 03:04:57.452]  I said, the protests played a role in this.
[03:04:59.933 --> 03:05:02.654]  And he said, what are they protesting?
[03:05:03.054 --> 03:05:03.974]  They're anti-Semites.
[03:05:04.014 --> 03:05:05.834]  I said, they're not anti-Semites.
[03:05:06.214 --> 03:05:12.075]  I forgot to say that a Semite are the Palestinians.
[03:05:13.055 --> 03:05:21.097]  The people running Israel, from Ben-Gurion to Golda Meir to Netanyahu, they're all Ashkenazi.
[03:05:21.117 --> 03:05:24.597]  They're all from Eastern Europe, the Kazar region.
[03:05:24.617 --> 03:05:25.937]  They're not Semites.
[03:05:26.698 --> 03:05:28.878]  So stop, let's stop using this term.
[03:05:31.124 --> 03:05:36.108]  So, it just kept going on and on, and I left the show.
[03:05:36.909 --> 03:05:37.949]  It was ridiculous.
[03:05:38.930 --> 03:05:46.976]  I started reading the definition of genocide, what it is, and he cut me off as I'm reading it.
[03:05:47.637 --> 03:05:48.778]  I said, don't let me finish.
[03:05:48.818 --> 03:05:51.880]  He said, you're stupid.
[03:05:52.440 --> 03:05:53.461]  You're dumb.
[03:05:53.541 --> 03:05:54.242]  Something like that.
[03:05:55.303 --> 03:05:57.104]  Here's the definition for genocide.
[03:05:58.931 --> 03:06:05.573]  The deliberate and systematic destruction of a group of people because of their ethnicity, nationality, religion, or race.
[03:06:08.594 --> 03:06:10.435]  And it cuts me off as I'm reading this.
[03:06:11.735 --> 03:06:32.545]   I wanted to make the point that it is cleansing the area because Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, had claimed that The Gaza waterfront property is, quote, valuable.
[03:06:34.585 --> 03:06:43.728]  At a February 15th event at Harvard University, Kushner said, Gaza's waterfront property could be very valuable.
[03:06:45.468 --> 03:06:48.269]  It's a little bit of an unfortunate situation there.
[03:06:50.870 --> 03:06:57.092]  But from Israel's perspective, I would do my best to move the people out of there and clean it up.
[03:06:58.405 --> 03:07:01.287]  Move the people out of there and clean it up.
[03:07:05.351 --> 03:07:08.753]  The deliberate and systematic destruction of a group of people.
[03:07:11.015 --> 03:07:12.436]  And I would do my best.
[03:07:12.456 --> 03:07:13.998]  Who the hell are you to do your best?
[03:07:14.518 --> 03:07:16.159]  Are you going to go over there and fight?
[03:07:17.180 --> 03:07:18.581]  You're going to go over there and fight?
[03:07:19.822 --> 03:07:20.503]  Of course not.
[03:07:20.983 --> 03:07:21.664]  We don't fight.
[03:07:22.424 --> 03:07:27.889]  We send other people to fight and we steal your money to do it.
[03:07:30.009 --> 03:07:32.791]  And when it gets out of hand, we'll draft you.
[03:07:33.791 --> 03:07:37.513]  But we won't go, just like B.S.
[03:07:38.254 --> 03:07:57.270]   Biden, who just stole almost $100 billion from we, the plantation workers of Slavelandia, to give to Ukraine, to give to Israel, to give to Taiwan, as B.S.
[03:07:57.610 --> 03:08:01.331]  Biden got five draft affirmants.
[03:08:03.832 --> 03:08:07.712]  He's only three and a half years older than me, Vietnam War era.
[03:08:09.273 --> 03:08:11.473]  Five draft affirmants.
[03:08:15.394 --> 03:08:17.075]  But they love war.
[03:08:17.095 --> 03:08:23.096]  Oh, there are the guys that fought war that love war too, like the cotton mouth over there.
[03:08:25.004 --> 03:08:36.868]  Anybody that supports war, go over there and fight, send your money, send your wife, send your kids, send your transgenders, or shut the hell up!
[03:08:37.568 --> 03:08:40.649]  I don't want my money going to kill other people.
[03:08:41.489 --> 03:08:43.530]  And I have nothing to do with this stuff.
[03:08:45.751 --> 03:08:46.911]  I am an American.
[03:08:48.371 --> 03:08:52.953]  I've read you George Washington's farewell address a dozen times.
[03:08:54.341 --> 03:08:57.724]  Do not get involved in this crap he said, basically.
[03:08:58.164 --> 03:09:00.246]  It's been going on for centuries.
[03:09:01.427 --> 03:09:04.169]  Oh yeah, but you gotta feed the military-industrial complex.
[03:09:04.209 --> 03:09:05.570]  What's wrong with you, Salenti?
[03:09:09.653 --> 03:09:10.013]  You ready?
[03:09:12.735 --> 03:09:13.836]  Going back to Kushner?
[03:09:18.420 --> 03:09:22.259]   I would do my best to move the people out of there and clean it up.
[03:09:22.259 --> 03:09:31.379]  And in addition, you ready?
[03:09:31.577 --> 03:09:34.659]  I would just bulldoze something in the Negev.
[03:09:34.679 --> 03:09:38.021]  I would try to move people there.
[03:09:38.982 --> 03:09:40.483]  I think that's a better option.
[03:09:41.584 --> 03:09:42.985]  So you could finish the job.
[03:09:43.005 --> 03:09:50.029]  So he's gonna, the desert, put the Palestinians in the Negev desert.
[03:09:50.930 --> 03:10:00.213]   I think it's a better option so you could finish the job of stealing the land because it's quote, valuable quote waterfront property.
[03:10:00.213 --> 03:10:13.334]  So this is great news that there may be a ceasefire.
[03:10:13.334 --> 03:10:23.334]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:10:14.521 --> 03:10:20.483]  And Blinken said today that Hamas may accept it.
[03:10:20.743 --> 03:10:21.603]  Egypt drew it up.
[03:10:22.799 --> 03:10:24.120]  And it's very positive.
[03:10:24.260 --> 03:10:28.662]  Although it doesn't say ceasefire permanently, they say it really does.
[03:10:28.842 --> 03:10:30.562]  So, that's what we need.
[03:10:32.003 --> 03:10:34.084]  Because this thing is ramping up.
[03:10:34.164 --> 03:10:37.646]  And again, they're making fun of all of these college protests.
[03:10:38.406 --> 03:10:45.989]  You had this, um, Netanyahu, he compared it to, uh, the 1930s Nazis.
[03:10:46.890 --> 03:10:48.650]  Again, I was on with these jerks.
[03:10:48.710 --> 03:10:50.271]  Like, I got off, I got off.
[03:10:50.291 --> 03:10:52.112]  They're little clowns, these whales.
[03:10:52.639 --> 03:10:53.359]  Little jerks.
[03:10:55.221 --> 03:10:56.341]  I told him to F off.
[03:10:56.461 --> 03:10:57.802]  I said, you're just pieces of crap.
[03:10:57.862 --> 03:10:58.783]  I called him Junior.
[03:10:58.803 --> 03:11:02.145]  That's why you call me Junior, because your mind is about that big.
[03:11:04.166 --> 03:11:05.006]  We need peace.
[03:11:05.987 --> 03:11:07.568]  We got to rebuild this country.
[03:11:08.208 --> 03:11:21.636]  We need to become a self-sustaining America, made in America, before slimeballs from Nixon to Reagan to Clinton started selling us out and all our manufacturing went overseas.
[03:11:22.668 --> 03:11:31.813]  We have all the human and natural resources we need to become the great America that our founding fathers fought for and all our ancestors came here for.
[03:11:31.833 --> 03:11:33.474]  That they've destroyed.
[03:11:33.494 --> 03:11:36.235]  Oh yeah, you can get a job at Target now.
[03:11:36.735 --> 03:11:37.816]  How about Home Depot?
[03:11:38.116 --> 03:11:39.997]  I think CVS would be great for me.
[03:11:41.458 --> 03:11:43.359]  My heart breaks when I go in these places.
[03:11:43.959 --> 03:11:45.340]  These people have no future.
[03:11:46.340 --> 03:11:48.921]  No more money for the military-industrial complex.
[03:11:49.301 --> 03:11:50.422]  Bring home the troops.
[03:11:50.602 --> 03:11:51.722]  Secure the homeland.
[03:11:52.023 --> 03:11:53.263]  No more migrants.
[03:11:55.144 --> 03:11:58.125]  America first and only.
[03:11:58.526 --> 03:12:00.346]  No, I'm not an isolationist.
[03:12:00.807 --> 03:12:02.067]  You go fight over there.
[03:12:03.388 --> 03:12:04.008]  Not for me.
[03:12:04.488 --> 03:12:07.690]  So what I really want to ask you to do is pray for myself and the crew and my family.
[03:12:08.050 --> 03:12:08.770]  That's number one.
[03:12:08.830 --> 03:12:09.570]  I want that.
[03:12:09.651 --> 03:12:10.071]  I need that.

[03:12:12.672 --> 03:12:13.552]  That's why this happened.
[03:12:13.572 --> 03:12:14.973]  I need the prayer.

[03:14:11.319 --> 03:14:15.976]   This is an article from The World Socialist website.
[03:14:17.817 --> 03:14:27.202]  White House Correspondents Dinner celebrates free press amid propaganda in support of war, genocide, and repression.
[03:14:28.842 --> 03:14:41.669]  The White House Correspondents Association dinner Saturday night was a disgusting display of subservience by the corporate media to the administration of President Joe Biden.
[03:14:43.334 --> 03:14:56.518]  It sought to cover up the blood-drenched role of his government, which is in full partner in the Israeli genocide in Gaza and spearheading the US-NATO war against Russia in Ukraine.
[03:14:57.239 --> 03:14:57.519]  Ready?
[03:14:58.459 --> 03:15:02.260]  Bringing the world ever closer to a nuclear third war.
[03:15:02.280 --> 03:15:09.663]  A trend that we had forecast on February 22nd, 2022.
[03:15:13.979 --> 03:15:24.927]  Two days before the Ukraine war began, we said if there's not peace, it's going to go from the COVID war to the Ukraine war to world war.
[03:15:25.307 --> 03:15:27.869]  It's your cover of your Trends Journal magazine.
[03:15:29.390 --> 03:15:52.129]   They go on to note here that the event was a centerpiece of several days of festivities, including parties and receptions thrown by Corporate trade groups and lobbyists, embassies and other well-heeled participants in the influence peddling in the U.S.
[03:15:52.189 --> 03:15:52.630]  Capitol.
[03:15:53.390 --> 03:15:54.791]  Perfectly set.
[03:15:55.952 --> 03:15:57.153]  Corporate trade groups.
[03:15:57.794 --> 03:16:08.222]  Look at this crap of stealing our money to give grants to countries like Taiwan or anywhere.
[03:16:08.928 --> 03:16:14.332]  To build ships, South Korea plants to build plants in America?
[03:16:16.134 --> 03:16:19.016]  Stealing our money to bring a foreign country here to make stuff?
[03:16:20.717 --> 03:16:22.479]  And I think the whole thing is done.
[03:16:22.539 --> 03:16:27.643]  It's a dirty deal from how they give these guys, I'm going to build a big office building.
[03:16:27.703 --> 03:16:29.024]  I'm going to create jobs.
[03:16:29.424 --> 03:16:35.089]  So yeah, you get a tax break while the rest of us have to pay full taxes and steal every penny from us.
[03:16:37.842 --> 03:16:40.443]  And again, I know you got a lot of Trump fans up there.
[03:16:40.884 --> 03:16:45.306]  Look at the tax deal he did in 2017.
[03:16:45.946 --> 03:16:54.490]  Yeah, he said it was going to, corporations are going to invest in it, capital goods.
[03:16:55.271 --> 03:16:56.852]  They didn't.
[03:16:57.292 --> 03:16:59.633]  2018 was one of the biggest year of stock buybacks.
[03:17:00.373 --> 03:17:06.036]  And according to the Tax Policy Center, some 64% went to the 1%.
[03:17:09.534 --> 03:17:15.176]  So the whole government is run by the bigs and the rich, and they're taking over everything.
[03:17:15.816 --> 03:17:16.256]  Everything.
[03:17:17.217 --> 03:17:22.519]  Each week in your Trends Journal magazine, each week, bigs getting bigger.
[03:17:22.799 --> 03:17:23.359]  All the facts.
[03:17:23.839 --> 03:17:30.881]  Again, when I was a young guy, there were no venture capitalists, private equity groups, hedge funds that owned everything.
[03:17:32.802 --> 03:17:33.482]  Didn't exist.
[03:17:34.583 --> 03:17:35.363]  They sold us out.
[03:17:37.898 --> 03:18:06.449]  The WHCA Banquet is an annual event at which the corporate media throws an expensive bash in honor of itself, celebrating its close ties to the administration and power and to the political establishment as a whole, while mouthing occasional hosannas to press freedom, although always in a way that aligns with U.S.
[03:18:06.529 --> 03:18:07.369]  foreign policy.
[03:18:11.829 --> 03:18:26.933]  They talk about how there was so much about this guy, Gershkovich, that's been held in a prison in Russia for a year, and this Austin Tice detained in Syria for 12 years.
[03:18:28.494 --> 03:18:30.974]  But not a peep about Assange.
[03:18:32.155 --> 03:18:34.235]  Zero, nada, zip.
[03:18:37.336 --> 03:18:38.856]  Yep, good article.
[03:18:39.397 --> 03:18:42.944]   It shows you the hypocrisy Of what the media is.
[03:18:44.785 --> 03:18:53.888]  And that's again, why you are tuned in to InfoWars and why you subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[03:18:56.269 --> 03:19:03.091]  They go on to say what Biden said about when Biden finally took the podium, his remarks were predictable.
[03:19:03.951 --> 03:19:09.353]  He devoted a few minutes to scripted jokes about his age and Trump's legal woes.
[03:19:10.305 --> 03:19:22.069]  Followed by 10 minutes ban to the free press as his ally in the defense of democracy against the dangers of Donald Trump.
[03:19:22.089 --> 03:19:23.870]  How disgusting to do that.
[03:19:24.830 --> 03:19:27.731]  Again, you want to run against Trump, you do that.
[03:19:27.771 --> 03:19:28.792]  You don't do that there.
[03:19:30.512 --> 03:19:31.953]  He paid tribute, you ready?
[03:19:32.773 --> 03:19:38.375]  To the patriotism and heroism of the media.
[03:19:41.800 --> 03:19:42.600]  Can you imagine this?
[03:19:43.060 --> 03:19:43.681]  The media.
[03:19:44.541 --> 03:19:46.501]  Again, oh Brzezinski, what was that Brzezinski?
[03:19:46.541 --> 03:19:49.322]  She's on that show with that other clown guy she's with over there.
[03:19:49.862 --> 03:19:51.223]  And what was it where her old man was?
[03:19:52.123 --> 03:19:56.824]  Brzezinski that gave us the Mujahideen that became the Taliban.
[03:19:56.964 --> 03:19:57.865]  Oh, that Brzezinski?
[03:19:58.205 --> 03:19:59.465]  Oh, yeah, she has a big show now.
[03:20:00.345 --> 03:20:01.306]  Yeah, it was under Carter.
[03:20:02.326 --> 03:20:04.687]  You got to stop them Russians over there in Afghanistan.
[03:20:05.207 --> 03:20:08.828]  They created the Mujahideen, which became al-Qaeda.
[03:20:10.836 --> 03:20:17.738]  Guy Stephanopoulos, oh yeah, he was a suck-up job for Bill Clinton, a mouthpiece, wasn't he?
[03:20:17.758 --> 03:20:18.878]  Yeah, he worked for Clinton, yeah.
[03:20:18.898 --> 03:20:21.619]  Oh yeah, he got a, hey, I'm Stephanopoulos, so you know who I am.
[03:20:23.060 --> 03:20:24.740]  Psaki, oh yeah, she's on there too.
[03:20:25.661 --> 03:20:26.841]  There's no media anymore.
[03:20:26.861 --> 03:20:28.701]  They're prostitutes.
[03:20:29.802 --> 03:20:33.623]  They're media whores that get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and government whoremasters.
[03:20:36.559 --> 03:20:39.520]  So again, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:20:39.780 --> 03:20:42.840]  Now we're going back to these college protests.
[03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:44.181]  These are very important.
[03:20:45.461 --> 03:20:54.303]  This is very, very important what's going on that these students are taking to... This is, again, I grew up going to Vietnam War.
[03:20:55.663 --> 03:21:01.044]  And what you're seeing now is basically going to be the cover of our magazine next week.
[03:21:02.004 --> 03:21:11.645]   When you see down in Austin, Texas, where you folks are, Bringing in the National Guard and the state troopers.
[03:21:11.745 --> 03:21:12.086]  Where's this?
[03:21:12.366 --> 03:21:12.986]  Kent State 2.0?
[03:21:13.026 --> 03:21:17.128]  You got these kids in these tents over there.
[03:21:17.508 --> 03:21:19.830]  Oh, somebody's holding up an anti-Semitic flag.
[03:21:19.850 --> 03:21:22.111]  Yeah, but how about the other, you know, a couple of hundred?
[03:21:22.551 --> 03:21:23.352]  Oh, they don't count.
[03:21:23.912 --> 03:21:28.975]  We're only going to pick out the ones, the agents provocateurs, so we could debase the whole thing.
[03:21:30.496 --> 03:21:31.236]  This is big.
[03:21:32.537 --> 03:21:34.638]  This is going to have an effect.
[03:21:35.808 --> 03:21:42.631]  Oh, and talking about anti-Semites, I guess that Jill Stein, I think Stein is a Jewish name.
[03:21:43.172 --> 03:21:44.672]  She's running on the Green Party.
[03:21:47.954 --> 03:21:52.996]  They locked her up for protesting Washington University on Saturday.
[03:21:53.576 --> 03:21:53.757]  Yeah.
[03:21:55.257 --> 03:21:58.779]  On Seder, there were thousands of people near Chuckie Schumer's.
[03:22:01.060 --> 03:22:02.921]  Mostly Jewish people protesting.
[03:22:03.701 --> 03:22:05.162]  This isn't anti-Semitic.
[03:22:07.034 --> 03:22:18.717]  I'm not anti-American because I hate America's wars and you're not anti-Semitic because you hate the slaughter of innocent Palestinians and watching their Gaza being blown to pieces.
[03:22:19.177 --> 03:22:20.638]  Stay tuned, we'll be right back.
[03:22:20.858 --> 03:22:21.818]  A lot more coming.
[03:22:22.358 --> 03:22:24.959]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[03:22:24.979 --> 03:22:28.840]  And again, everybody listening, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:22:29.420 --> 03:22:32.101]  Because InfoWars is doing everything they can to support you.
[03:22:32.765 --> 03:22:41.168]  They've got these great products and you really need this stuff to stay healthy in a time of, you know, what's your favorite GMO?
[03:22:41.208 --> 03:22:43.248]  Do I like all those microplastics?
[03:22:43.408 --> 03:22:48.150]  I mean, you know, with the crap they put in the food, ultra-process this and that.
[03:22:48.890 --> 03:22:57.033]  So they have a real nice deal over here, another 40% off deal with their Ultimate Fish Oil and it's back in stock.
[03:22:57.950 --> 03:23:07.132]  It's been out for a while, but like most of these products, they come in and they go out, so you have to get them while they can because people have been waiting months for their ultimate fish oil.
[03:23:07.772 --> 03:23:10.153]  And again, they just got it back 40% off.
[03:23:10.193 --> 03:23:37.668]   You know, fish oil has been one of the most recognizable supplements on the market, all over the place and for very good reasons because of the studies that suggest that fish oils and fish oil supplements can Lower blood pressure, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and prevent cognitive decline.
[03:23:38.569 --> 03:23:41.492]  Boy, the decline is cognitive all over the place.
[03:23:42.292 --> 03:23:52.462]  So, you got these capsules, they got, you know, 100,000 milligrams of EPA and DHA taking ultimate fish oil.
[03:23:53.966 --> 03:24:03.033]  It's like, you know, they say it's like eating a half a pound of cooked tuna or one pound of catfish.
[03:24:04.935 --> 03:24:06.036]  It's got all this great stuff in it.
[03:24:06.156 --> 03:24:31.613]   We've got the Wild Anchovy Purified Fish Oil, Ultra Pure Antarctica Krill Oil, High Quality Wild Caught Salmon Oil, Vitamin D, Vitamin A. Again, it supports your heart, your joints, Cognitive health, immune function, vascular health, circulatory health, and your health.
[03:24:31.913 --> 03:24:32.493]  Stay healthy.
[03:24:33.353 --> 03:24:40.337]  So don't forget, you know, they're fighting, we're all fighting against the globalists and the maniacs in charge.
[03:24:41.497 --> 03:24:49.601]  And you get your ultimate fish oil, you go to InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:24:50.221 --> 03:24:53.403]  Get it now 40% off before it goes away.
[03:24:57.073 --> 03:25:05.176]  You know, I was talking before about propaganda, what they call correspondence.
[03:25:05.216 --> 03:25:05.896]  There's no media.
[03:25:05.916 --> 03:25:07.517]  Again, it's all owned by the bigs.
[03:25:07.537 --> 03:25:18.060]  You can thank that slimeball, murderous SOB every time he got caught with his pants down, Bill Clinton, for destroying the media with his 1996 Federal Communications Act.
[03:25:20.473 --> 03:25:23.234]  It did away with all of the antitrust laws.
[03:25:23.854 --> 03:25:28.655]  And now you got six companies that control well over 90% of the media.
[03:25:29.275 --> 03:25:31.215]  This is from The Wall.
[03:25:31.615 --> 03:25:32.816]  I can't say the right word.
[03:25:32.836 --> 03:25:38.657]  It starts with an S and ends with a T. The Wall Street Journal, but the real name is a different one.
[03:25:40.017 --> 03:25:43.578]  Graduates shaped by pandemic protest.
[03:25:45.038 --> 03:25:54.543]   Class of 24 has been defined by anxiety, Starting with isolation and ending in anger.
[03:25:55.944 --> 03:26:02.769]  Columbia's class of 2024 missed high school graduations and university orientation.
[03:26:03.489 --> 03:26:10.754]  Their freshman year passed in a haze of masks, Zoom classes and isolation.
[03:26:12.415 --> 03:26:15.578]  For years, four years later, you ready?
[03:26:15.658 --> 03:26:16.879]  Not much has changed.
[03:26:17.559 --> 03:26:28.014]   Thanks to Gaza protests, crowds, Classes have gone remote and students are wearing masks.
[03:26:30.456 --> 03:26:37.721]  This has nothing to do with the pandemic of why there is anger.
[03:26:38.282 --> 03:26:45.588]  Yes, it's right about anxiety, starting with isolation, because of stupid laws that imbeciles made up.
[03:26:46.168 --> 03:26:47.269]  Oh, and here's the fact.
[03:26:49.371 --> 03:26:49.691]  Facts.
[03:26:51.903 --> 03:26:56.885]  There are 73 million 1- to 17-year-olds in America.
[03:26:59.647 --> 03:27:07.810]  From January 2020 to June of 2023, when they stopped reporting the numbers, under 2,000 died of COVID.
[03:27:08.911 --> 03:27:10.372]  That's according to the CDC.
[03:27:11.612 --> 03:27:13.633]  But yet you sent them home, locked them up.
[03:27:14.113 --> 03:27:17.175]  You had those kids in little tents playing instruments.
[03:27:21.955 --> 03:27:23.916]  2,000 out of 73 million.
[03:27:27.637 --> 03:27:29.477]  But they put this kind of crap out there.
[03:27:31.298 --> 03:27:33.798]  Again, this is why you subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[03:27:34.158 --> 03:27:36.959]  You know, we're giving you economic data, geopolitical data.
[03:27:37.579 --> 03:27:41.420]  What InfoWars is giving you, you're not getting.
[03:27:41.861 --> 03:27:45.982]  Again, this is the kind of crap that they're putting out there.
[03:27:46.502 --> 03:27:50.383]  And it went that big.
[03:27:54.397 --> 03:27:54.997]  That big.
[03:27:57.039 --> 03:27:58.000]  And I get these sort of notes.
[03:27:58.040 --> 03:27:59.921]  This is when I get these go to our writers.
[03:28:00.682 --> 03:28:03.124]  I read all this junk and then I give them the comments.
[03:28:04.685 --> 03:28:05.826]  Total propaganda.
[03:28:05.846 --> 03:28:07.907]  Yep.
[03:28:11.550 --> 03:28:18.996]  College students today are lonelier, less resilient, and more disengaged than their predecessors' research shows.
[03:28:19.056 --> 03:28:19.756]  Yeah, no kidding.
[03:28:20.317 --> 03:28:23.099]  Yeah, they're addicted to their... Everybody's addicted to their...
[03:28:25.216 --> 03:28:33.720]  Phones and crap and... Again, why you get these products from InfoWars?
[03:28:33.780 --> 03:28:37.703]  This is another, this is again how they skew things.
[03:28:38.643 --> 03:28:41.725]  This is a toilet paper record, New York Times story.
[03:28:42.685 --> 03:28:45.607]  Scientists eye fasting's effect on longevity.
[03:28:49.008 --> 03:28:58.341]   If you're a lab mouse on a diet, cutting the animal's Caloric intake by 30 to 40 percent, it will live longer.
[03:28:59.202 --> 03:29:00.802]  On average, about 30 percent longer.
[03:29:01.663 --> 03:29:17.688]  The calorie restriction, as the intervention is technically called, can't be so extreme that the animal is malnourished, but it should be aggressive enough to trigger some key biological changes.
[03:29:18.688 --> 03:29:25.708]   Subsequent studies also found that many of the calories restricted Animals.
[03:29:27.069 --> 03:29:39.055]  The subsequent studies also found that many of the calorie-restricted animals were less likely to develop cancer and other chronic diseases related to aging.
[03:29:39.075 --> 03:29:41.457]  It has nothing to do with mice.
[03:29:43.438 --> 03:29:44.958]  They're feeding us crap.
[03:29:46.619 --> 03:29:48.140]  Look what the people look like.
[03:29:48.921 --> 03:29:49.961]  Look what they're eating.
[03:29:51.602 --> 03:29:53.383]  Ultra-processed garbage.
[03:29:57.003 --> 03:30:03.286]  Again, that's why you want these products from InfoWars, because you don't want this to be you.
[03:30:04.626 --> 03:30:09.988]  You know, there was an article that came out about this guy Bill Maher.
[03:30:10.008 --> 03:30:11.689]  I can't stand that arrogant guy.
[03:30:11.709 --> 03:30:16.291]  Oh, he came out against 9-11, he said it was something that we deserved.
[03:30:16.351 --> 03:30:17.431]  Oh, then he backtracked.
[03:30:17.451 --> 03:30:20.933]  Yeah, that little cowardly look, that arrogant look.
[03:30:22.633 --> 03:30:28.663]   Bill Maher slams pro-Palestinian protesters as ignorant, Unemployed narcissists.
[03:30:31.805 --> 03:30:36.288]  Bill Maher isn't mincing his words.
[03:30:36.829 --> 03:30:38.670]  Yeah, crap just spews out of his mouth.
[03:30:40.351 --> 03:30:47.516]  Yes, I'm sure there are injustices on both sides of the Middle East, as there are injustices all over the world.
[03:30:48.797 --> 03:30:50.638]  But I'm going to be late for work, he said.
[03:30:50.658 --> 03:30:52.740]  Injustices?
[03:30:54.000 --> 03:30:56.161]  I mean, 40,000 people being killed.
[03:30:56.601 --> 03:30:58.902]  Oh, today there is a CNN headline.
[03:30:58.922 --> 03:31:04.545]  20 people killed yesterday in Rafah, bombed to death by Israel.
[03:31:06.926 --> 03:31:09.987]  So 40,000, 70% of them women and children.
[03:31:12.028 --> 03:31:12.849]  Unarmed people.
[03:31:15.630 --> 03:31:17.391]  And this is the kind of garbage he spews out.
[03:31:20.532 --> 03:31:22.733]  And about 80,000 are seriously wounded.
[03:31:25.715 --> 03:31:31.394]   I'm not saying there aren't sincere passions about Gaza, especially among people from the
[03:31:31.394 --> 03:31:35.034]  region, but social justice warriors?
[03:31:35.034 --> 03:31:36.034]  Sure.
[03:31:36.034 --> 03:31:36.534]  Yep.
[03:31:36.534 --> 03:31:40.034]  Yep.
[03:31:40.034 --> 03:31:50.034]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:31:41.586 --> 03:31:47.090]  If it makes you feel good to cosplay as revolutionaries, knock yourself out.
[03:31:48.051 --> 03:31:49.071]  Burn yourself out.
[03:31:49.592 --> 03:31:51.453]  Just don't drag Gaza into it.
[03:31:54.246 --> 03:31:56.507]  Why do I care so much about this particular cause?
[03:31:56.527 --> 03:31:58.909]  This is the arrogance of this.
[03:31:58.929 --> 03:32:03.432]  This is, goes back, we at the president's dinner, we are sucking up and bowing down.
[03:32:03.452 --> 03:32:07.014]  This is why you need to support InfoWars.
[03:32:07.094 --> 03:32:09.196]  I'm giving you these examples about this.
[03:32:10.236 --> 03:32:12.498]  About how freedom is stolen from us.
[03:32:13.298 --> 03:32:14.759]  Peace is a dirty word.
[03:32:15.300 --> 03:32:16.600]  Justice, none for us.
[03:32:17.861 --> 03:32:20.203]  Yeah, JPMorgan Chase, five felonies.
[03:32:20.223 --> 03:32:22.044]  Hey, I'm Jamie Dimon, I don't go to jail.
[03:32:22.836 --> 03:32:24.577]  Hey, you were 10 miles over the limit.
[03:32:24.617 --> 03:32:26.658]  Stand on your head, repeat the alphabet backwards.
[03:32:27.019 --> 03:32:29.941]  You're .0 over the limit, now you're going to jail.
[03:32:31.401 --> 03:32:32.942]  You gotta support InfoWars.
[03:32:33.703 --> 03:32:38.466]  And if you want to see history before it happens, you want Trends Journal, go to jonestrends.com.
[03:32:39.184 --> 03:32:40.806]  Let's go to Nurse Keith in Oregon.
[03:32:40.826 --> 03:32:41.347]  You're on the air.
[03:32:41.387 --> 03:32:42.288]  Welcome and thanks for holding.
[03:32:42.648 --> 03:32:53.001]  About an hour ago, you were kind of explaining to people about how the micronutrients and stuff that are available and different foods actually have an effect on... Well, let's be clear.
[03:32:53.041 --> 03:32:55.505]  There isn't long-term, billion-year evolution.
[03:32:55.804 --> 03:33:03.483]   There's jumps, but like how you build a car, cars have evolved, or electricity, or computers
[03:33:03.483 --> 03:33:04.704]  have changed.
[03:33:04.704 --> 03:33:10.024]   There is innovation and humans do get ancestral memories from their ancestors.
[03:33:10.024 --> 03:33:11.024]  That's called instincts.
[03:33:11.024 --> 03:33:12.023]  Yes.
[03:33:12.023 --> 03:33:17.544]   I'm not trying to brag, but I'm a board certified wound care associate, which is not an easy
[03:33:17.544 --> 03:33:18.544]  certification.
[03:33:18.544 --> 03:33:20.544]  Yeah, it takes years.
[03:33:20.595 --> 03:33:25.459]  And it encompasses, you know, cardiology, endocrine, pulmonary, you name it.
[03:33:25.539 --> 03:33:27.180]  You've got to be good at all kinds of stuff.
[03:33:27.760 --> 03:33:31.523]  And let's face it, a lot of my doctors, they don't know anything about this stuff.
[03:33:31.603 --> 03:33:34.806]  It's my job as a nurse to figure it out.
[03:33:35.046 --> 03:33:39.049]  The average medical doctor gets two hours of college education on nutrition.
[03:33:39.389 --> 03:33:43.953]  So one of the things that I do is I'm looking for results.
[03:33:45.174 --> 03:33:52.683]   And by using Very good nutraceuticals and supplements and things like that.
[03:33:52.783 --> 03:33:54.664]  I can fix a problem.
[03:33:54.824 --> 03:33:55.904]  Just a real quick example.
[03:33:55.924 --> 03:34:02.245]  Let's say you have a really bad wound on your leg and you have diabetes and poor circulation.
[03:34:02.365 --> 03:34:13.711]   Well, I can order you a bottle of Nitric Boost, a bottle of BezoBeat, and Get your ass up on a treadmill a little bit.
[03:34:14.752 --> 03:34:18.497]  These things work better than any of the medication that we give.
[03:34:19.224 --> 03:34:24.367]  So I've got about 35,000 points because I gave these things away as gifts.
[03:34:24.688 --> 03:34:25.288]  Hold on, hold on.
[03:34:25.328 --> 03:34:26.129]  This is important.
[03:34:26.169 --> 03:34:27.549]  This is important, absolutely.
[03:34:28.010 --> 03:34:30.792]  Just iodine alone, it's essential.
[03:34:30.812 --> 03:34:31.612]  It means you die without it.
[03:34:31.632 --> 03:34:33.173]  They don't tell you most people are deficient.
[03:34:33.513 --> 03:34:35.595]  Two billion people have cognitive disabilities, the UN admits.
[03:34:35.835 --> 03:34:38.977]  That's what these concentrated plants and other compounds do.
[03:34:39.377 --> 03:34:43.580]   So you're saying you're taking care of people with wounds, one of the biggest Medical industry's out there.
[03:34:43.640 --> 03:34:44.460]  Super tough job.
[03:34:44.780 --> 03:34:48.242]  You're seeing with nutrition and also they need to not be sedentary, obviously.
[03:34:48.702 --> 03:34:51.623]  You're seeing massive effects, because I've actually read about this.
[03:34:51.663 --> 03:35:00.747]  I'm not an expert like you, but that there's massive problems because the doctors don't even say exercise or get out of the bed or take supplements that are good for your skin.
[03:35:01.168 --> 03:35:02.148]  And it's so simple.
[03:35:02.208 --> 03:35:06.710]  I mean, my wife takes supplements to have good hair and good nails, and it really works for her.
[03:35:06.810 --> 03:35:07.911]  I mean, this stuff works.
[03:35:07.991 --> 03:35:08.931]  It's the compounds.
[03:35:09.271 --> 03:35:10.692]  Tell people about some of the things you've witnessed.
[03:35:11.212 --> 03:35:17.442]  Alex, I would not have 35,000 Patriot Points if this stuff didn't work.
[03:35:17.562 --> 03:35:20.827]  I'm not into buying BS and I don't push BS.
[03:35:21.488 --> 03:35:33.687]   When I've got a complex wound and I see something that you guys sell that I know We can sell the stuff Walmart sells, synthetic stuff, and the bottle costs more than what they're selling.
[03:35:33.707 --> 03:35:37.891]  With us, these products, some of these products are costing us $30 a bottle, like DNA Force, okay?
[03:35:37.810 --> 03:35:40.570]  The stuff that you guys sell is legit.
[03:35:40.570 --> 03:35:44.610]   We can sell the stuff Walmart sells, synthetic stuff, and the bottle costs more than what
[03:35:44.610 --> 03:35:45.729]  they're selling.
[03:35:45.729 --> 03:35:50.931]   With us, these products, some of these products are costing us $30 a bottle, like DNA Force.
[03:35:50.931 --> 03:35:51.931]  Okay?
[03:35:51.931 --> 03:35:55.050]  I mean, so there's cost because it is the highest rated.
[03:35:55.050 --> 03:36:01.450]   If you're taking a nitrate, like you were talking about the Nitrate Boost, boom, that
[03:36:01.450 --> 03:36:02.489]  is going to vasodilate.
[03:36:03.170 --> 03:36:07.613]  So when you're vasodilated, yeah, you're going to be pitching a proper 10.
[03:36:07.973 --> 03:36:09.594]  The vasobeat does the exact same thing.
[03:36:10.014 --> 03:36:13.236]  But it also helps if I've got a person who's got really poor perfusion.
[03:36:14.133 --> 03:36:20.297]  And I just want to get their blood flow going so that I can keep this wound from going septic and actually get some granulation going.
[03:36:20.817 --> 03:36:22.699]  Or I could throw all the medications at it.
[03:36:22.719 --> 03:36:24.200]  It's not going to do a damn thing.
[03:36:24.560 --> 03:36:29.843]  The doctors see the patient for 10 minutes, write a prescription, say, OK, come back in 45 days.
[03:36:30.184 --> 03:36:32.065]  And it's my job to actually go figure it out.
[03:36:32.265 --> 03:36:34.787]  And so I use a lot of the stuff that you guys have.
[03:36:35.087 --> 03:36:35.807]  Thank you so much.
[03:36:35.847 --> 03:36:36.968]  And God bless you, Nurse Keith.
[03:36:36.988 --> 03:36:37.528]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:36:37.548 --> 03:36:38.149]  Give his name and number.
