[00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:18.724]  InfoWars.
[00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:19.968]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.590]  Today.
[00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:51.916]  It's Sunday, June 9th, 2024.
[00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:55.798]  And in just 30 seconds, Trump nails it.
[00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:13.206]  What is the hardest, darkest moment that you can think of in this journey you've been on over the last several years?
[00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.927]  You have to be very strong.
[00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:19.062]  You're fighting off very evil forces, and they're very smart forces.
[00:01:20.322 --> 00:01:21.923]  There are people that control Biden.
[00:01:22.143 --> 00:01:22.683]  Totally true.
[00:01:22.723 --> 00:01:24.244]  I think I know who they are, largely.
[00:01:24.764 --> 00:01:25.824]  But there are people that control him.
[00:01:25.844 --> 00:01:27.705]  They're very smart, very energetic.
[00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:32.727]  Possibly they're real believers, you know, what their sick ideology is.
[00:01:32.747 --> 00:01:37.469]  Again, it's Sunday, June 9, 2024.
[00:01:39.286 --> 00:01:40.446]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:45.067]  We're getting very close to the most important election in world history.
[00:01:46.107 --> 00:01:55.169]  We're going to be here for the next four hours live this evening in what could be some of the final broadcasts in InfoWars history in this incarnation.
[00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:59.050]  But we shall return stronger than ever.
[00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.811]  Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, because we have God and the people on our side.
[00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:06.091]  How many days are we to the election?
[00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:07.952]  Let's put that on screen.
[00:02:09.534 --> 00:02:10.936]  We are 148 days, 7 hours, 57 minutes, 55 seconds.
[00:02:10.956 --> 00:02:13.899]  Alright, here's the deal.
[00:02:19.997 --> 00:02:30.779]  We have a lot of obviously incredibly important news to get to today dealing with what's happening in the world and I will do my best, my dead level best to cover it all.
[00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:33.340]  Some of it is horrifying news for humanity.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.021]  A lot of it is really, really good news for humanity and we're going to do our best to break down as much as we can.
[00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:47.423]  We also have a witness on January 6 who's a very respected, recently retired Air Force Colonel.
[00:02:48.383 --> 00:02:55.508]  And Top Gun pilot who witnessed January 6th, the Feds tearing down the barricades and running the operation.
[00:02:55.528 --> 00:02:58.149]  But that's only a small part of what he talks about.
[00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.370]  Very smart guy.
[00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.272]  I had him on during spaces a little bit on Friday.
[00:03:02.292 --> 00:03:03.312]  I wanted to have him back here.
[00:03:03.372 --> 00:03:16.420]  Colonel Gannon Burton will be joining us on Ukraine, Russia, China, Israel, Hamas, solutions, faith, grace, courage, don't overthink things, finding fissures and prying them open in the global operation.
[00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:19.101]  How critical is Trump?
[00:03:19.581 --> 00:03:20.922]  Very smart guy, very impressed.
[00:03:20.942 --> 00:03:25.683]  I've been on spaces with him where he comes on probably 10 times.
[00:03:25.703 --> 00:03:29.083]  I think he was on the one, in fact, I know he was when I was on with Elon Musk for two and a half hours.
[00:03:29.103 --> 00:03:31.804]  This is going to be powerful.
[00:03:32.324 --> 00:03:38.845]  And then we've got Chase Geyser coming in this evening for Sunday Night Live, which comes over two hours after me.
[00:03:39.425 --> 00:03:44.346]  And then I'm going to be hosting tomorrow morning the first part of
[00:03:45.635 --> 00:03:47.737]  American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[00:03:47.777 --> 00:03:48.497]  So at 8 a.m.
[00:03:48.537 --> 00:03:56.583]  Central, there is several big announcements dealing with Infowars that I'll tell you about tomorrow morning, but also Tucker Carlson.
[00:03:57.804 --> 00:04:04.309]  So we'll be talking about that coming up tomorrow at 8 a.m.
[00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.731]  Central, 9 a.m.
[00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:08.732]  Eastern tomorrow.
[00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:13.095]  And in the next few weeks and months, there's going to be quite a few
[00:04:14.036 --> 00:04:17.558]  Announcements and very exciting things going on here in the Info War.
[00:04:18.119 --> 00:04:20.260]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.022]  Because the Info War is a lot bigger than this building.
[00:04:23.982 --> 00:04:24.963]  It's a lot bigger than me.
[00:04:25.663 --> 00:04:26.704]  It's a lot bigger than you.
[00:04:26.764 --> 00:04:30.166]  It's about all of us and God fighting these evil forces.
[00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:37.651]  All right, we're gonna go to break and I'm gonna reset and get ready to blast out when 300 plus radio stations join us.
[00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:42.364]  And I want all those stations to know, no matter where we go for a short period, we'll be back.
[00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:46.648]  And a sneaking suspicion tells me we'll have even more affiliates.
[00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:50.392]  Because that which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:04:50.412 --> 00:04:56.718]  And we have some big updates on the Deep State's open plan to shut down this operation straight ahead.
[00:04:56.738 --> 00:04:59.301]  Follow me on Exit Reel, Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:05.300]  Your cardiovascular system is under attack.
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.621]  Everybody knows it.
[00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:13.764]  And I've got in my hands two products that are absolutely insane when it comes to what they do for your body and your overall health.
[00:05:14.364 --> 00:05:17.366]  One of them is the highest grade fish oil you can find.
[00:05:17.826 --> 00:05:19.367]  Everybody knows how good fish oil is.
[00:05:19.607 --> 00:05:20.627]  This is as good as it gets.
[00:05:21.027 --> 00:05:25.669]  And when you purchase it at InfoWarsTore.com, you support the broadcast, a 360 win.
[00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.450]  And then of course, Nitric Boost.
[00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.051]  You've heard all the rage about this.
[00:05:29.071 --> 00:05:30.952]  A whole bunch of concentrated natural compounds.
[00:05:31.212 --> 00:05:31.532]  I think so.
[00:05:54.474 --> 00:05:58.538]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:50.991 --> 00:07:00.573]  First of all, all of these people, whether it's Marco Rubio, Mike Johnson, Mark Meadows, have all said disparaging things at one point in time about Donald Ted Cruz.
[00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:01.493]  The same thing.
[00:07:02.495 --> 00:07:15.939]  They believe that if Donald Trump wins, and they are shoulder to shoulder with him, that they will have unlimited power, which would of course give them the ability to make or to have unlimited resources and assets.
[00:07:16.579 --> 00:07:18.040]  One mistake that they are making,
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.182]  Donald Trump doesn't share.
[00:07:20.702 --> 00:07:22.304]  It's all about him.
[00:07:22.784 --> 00:07:23.945]  Not about his kids.
[00:07:24.346 --> 00:07:25.627]  Not about his family.
[00:07:25.947 --> 00:07:27.109]  It is all about him.
[00:07:27.329 --> 00:07:37.940]  So if they think that they're going to hitch themselves to his wagon in hopes that they're going to elevate themselves, whether it's through power, through money, through connections and so on, it doesn't work that way.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:52.837]  He will not allow them, and just like Putin, once you start to get too big for your own britches, people will start flying out of windows, they will start like Navalny, they will end up in gulags, they will end up, as Donald says all the time, send them to Gitmo!
[00:07:53.357 --> 00:07:54.538]  Send him to Guantanamo Bay!
[00:08:14.105 --> 00:08:14.886]  I mean, what happens to you?
[00:08:14.926 --> 00:08:15.526]  What happens to you?
[00:08:15.806 --> 00:08:18.448]  Because they tried everything to get to you.
[00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:23.952]  You have now been a key witness in a criminal conviction of the President of the United States.
[00:08:23.972 --> 00:08:24.533]  And a civil.
[00:08:24.593 --> 00:08:25.013]  And a civil.
[00:08:25.573 --> 00:08:29.016]  The first time ever for a former or sitting President of the United States.
[00:08:29.797 --> 00:08:31.778]  What do you think about if Donald Trump wins again?
[00:08:32.018 --> 00:08:35.901]  Well, I'm certainly sure that... You're thinking about your Canadian family members.
[00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:36.902]  Absolutely.
[00:08:37.022 --> 00:08:40.284]  Or I have family in other parts of the country too that I won't disclose.
[00:08:40.364 --> 00:08:40.785]  Maybe I'll...
[00:08:41.765 --> 00:08:41.905]  Yeah.
[00:09:12.346 --> 00:09:15.909]  Even considered to be the
[00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:25.482]  Republican nominee, one of our two political parties, it should be so offensive to everyone in this country.
[00:09:25.782 --> 00:09:30.026]  A man who doesn't believe in the very First Amendment to the Constitution.
[00:09:30.206 --> 00:09:44.319]  And by the way, all of these folks that think Donald Trump is the key to the Second Amendment, that he's our Second Amendment guy, what do dictators do on day number one when they become the autocrat, the monarch, the fuhrer, the supreme leader?
[00:09:44.599 --> 00:09:47.320]  You round up all the weapons because you don't want a militia.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.901]  You don't want civilians being able to get together to create a militia against you.
[00:09:53.122 --> 00:09:57.703]  These autocracies don't have free-flowing weapons like we have in America.
[00:10:03.785 --> 00:10:06.986]  That is the most ridiculous horse crap I've ever heard.
[00:10:07.666 --> 00:10:10.067]  Trump is going to become a dictator?
[00:10:11.866 --> 00:10:16.249]  And Trump is going to take your guns!
[00:10:16.269 --> 00:10:18.531]  And Trump is going to arrest all the Democrats.
[00:10:19.331 --> 00:10:20.892]  The Democrats want to take our guns.
[00:10:21.533 --> 00:10:22.593]  They've dissolved the border.
[00:10:23.234 --> 00:10:27.557]  They're the ones trying to destroy our freedoms on every single front.
[00:10:28.537 --> 00:10:31.119]  They are the ones doing this to us.
[00:10:31.259 --> 00:10:39.385]  They are the ones arresting Trump and many of his top supporters and trying to shut us all down and brag about it.
[00:10:41.058 --> 00:10:42.379]  And licking their lips about it.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.603]  And it just goes on and on and on and on.
[00:10:48.344 --> 00:10:48.984]  At every level.
[00:10:50.425 --> 00:10:51.466]  Absolutely insane.
[00:10:53.267 --> 00:10:56.330]  And that's why with only a hundred and... How many days left?
[00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.512]  Let's put it on screen.
[00:10:59.532 --> 00:11:03.075]  148 days, 7 hours, 47 minutes, 10 seconds.
[00:11:03.856 --> 00:11:05.317]  Most important election in world history.
[00:11:05.337 --> 00:11:07.819]  You can cut the suspense with a knife.
[00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:10.801]  Okay, so let me tell you what's coming up tonight.
[00:11:14.605 --> 00:11:36.292]  The projections are in, and anti-globalist nationalist parties are absolutely set to win in massive landslides across the EU, continuing the trend of the last three years.
[00:11:37.372 --> 00:11:43.454]  Now remember, there's so many parties in parliamentary systems, dozens on average, that have some percentage points.
[00:11:44.622 --> 00:12:06.006]  That even though nationalist, anti-globalist, anti-New World Order parties just won in France, and Germany, and a bunch of other countries in Europe, and I've got the list right here, they're still only winning by 30%, or 28%, or 31%, which is double in Germany what the national government, coalition government has.
[00:12:06.386 --> 00:12:07.186]  Same thing in France.
[00:12:09.066 --> 00:12:12.707]  Marie Le Pen, nationalist populist,
[00:12:16.923 --> 00:12:20.044]  Got twice the votes, or actually double the votes of Macron.
[00:12:21.924 --> 00:12:24.505]  To be technical, when he got 14, she got 30%.
[00:12:25.605 --> 00:12:26.306]  A little over double.
[00:12:27.966 --> 00:12:29.847]  I mean, this is big, people.
[00:12:30.407 --> 00:12:33.348]  But look, Trudeau up in Canada got less than 20%.
[00:12:35.226 --> 00:12:38.507]  And the Conservative Party is over 40, but how is he still in power?
[00:12:39.068 --> 00:12:42.769]  Through coalitions with the other little parties that team up with him.
[00:12:42.849 --> 00:12:44.290]  So that's what's happening.
[00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:56.135]  But all of those little parties, like the Communist Party and the Socialist Party and the Green Party, they've got them all in the UK, in Germany, in Canada, everywhere.
[00:12:56.655 --> 00:13:00.296]  They've lost in the last three years half their support on average.
[00:13:00.677 --> 00:13:02.757]  I've got all the stacks and all the info here.
[00:13:02.997 --> 00:13:04.018]  You can look it up yourself if you want.
[00:13:05.307 --> 00:13:06.968]  So it's eroding very, very quickly.
[00:13:07.348 --> 00:13:08.769]  That's why they're in full panic mode.
[00:13:08.789 --> 00:13:10.470]  So we're going to get into this first.
[00:13:11.391 --> 00:13:14.973]  Then breaking COVID mRNA jabs are not vaccines.
[00:13:15.413 --> 00:13:16.253]  Courts rules.
[00:13:18.375 --> 00:13:23.078]  That's the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
[00:13:23.718 --> 00:13:27.440]  That is so seismic, as I pointed out, and I'm going to explain why.
[00:13:28.861 --> 00:13:29.962]  IMF calls on U.S.
[00:13:30.002 --> 00:13:32.123]  to get its gargantuan debt under control.
[00:13:32.743 --> 00:13:33.724]  The IMF is
[00:13:34.997 --> 00:13:35.577]  The U.S.
[00:13:35.597 --> 00:13:39.660]  Global Extension of Worldwide Central Banks, along with the World Bank.
[00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:44.943]  So that's the system reporting on itself.
[00:13:46.764 --> 00:13:49.585]  We have this huge stack of anti-Alex Jones news.
[00:13:49.625 --> 00:13:52.207]  This is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:13:52.247 --> 00:13:54.168]  I've got about 25 of them or so here.
[00:13:55.558 --> 00:13:55.859]  We're good.
[00:14:10.819 --> 00:14:14.381]  legal team that the General Counsel of Connecticut confessed to cooking it all up.
[00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:26.426]  Taking things I'd never said, putting it in the news, hyping it all up, having PR firms push it, organizing lawsuits, having me found in default so I didn't even have a trial, then they had show trials on the damages.
[00:14:27.306 --> 00:14:28.626]  People say, okay, we already know about this.
[00:14:28.646 --> 00:14:29.907]  Well, the general public doesn't know.
[00:14:30.387 --> 00:14:36.730]  And now, in Reuters and other publications, they are quoted, the feds, as
[00:14:39.349 --> 00:14:45.091]  Yeah, Alex Jones wouldn't pay us $100 million, which I've never made in my life, not even half that.
[00:14:45.791 --> 00:14:49.812]  And Alex Jones wouldn't want in control of his company.
[00:14:50.232 --> 00:14:58.454]  So they've now admitted what was said in the mediations, which they said outside the mediations to us, so I can talk about it, to the world.
[00:14:58.834 --> 00:15:05.056]  Yeah, we're not going to let him, we want double the profits this company's ever had, which is impossible.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.083]  And we don't want him in control of his company.
[00:15:08.143 --> 00:15:13.032]  So see, the media spun this that, oh, Jones is throwing in the towel, Jones is giving up.
[00:15:13.072 --> 00:15:13.232]  No.
[00:15:13.853 --> 00:15:18.281]  Next Friday, the judges said, he's either, they're going to settle or he's going to give me the company back.
[00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.771]  So they said, fine, we're going to file a Chapter 7 liquidation.
[00:15:23.151 --> 00:15:24.531]  So I filed it the same day as them.
[00:15:25.052 --> 00:15:29.333]  So I'll have standing to even debate that in federal court and hold them off a little bit longer.
[00:15:30.073 --> 00:15:40.317]  Because as soon as there's a state course run by Judge Maya Gamble-Guerra, whatever her name is, they will put padlocks in this place within days.
[00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:41.357]  They've bragged they'll do it.
[00:15:41.757 --> 00:15:44.578]  They'll appoint a state receiver, shut us down like that.
[00:15:45.858 --> 00:15:47.219]  So if you're already a checkmate in a
[00:15:48.564 --> 00:15:57.567]  Chess game, if you don't move to the other move, sure you might get killed in two or three other moves, you can see that's going to happen, but at least you fight to the end.
[00:15:59.287 --> 00:16:08.950]  And again, I have been extremely steadfast to InfoWars and not, it's like your wife's on her deathbed and she's fighting cancer or something for six months.
[00:16:08.991 --> 00:16:10.071]  You don't go off and get a new wife.
[00:16:10.611 --> 00:16:13.332]  You wait until she's dead and buried until you start dating again.
[00:16:14.377 --> 00:16:15.358]  Or maybe you never get another wife.
[00:16:15.398 --> 00:16:16.418]  Well, in my case, I would.
[00:16:17.639 --> 00:16:18.519]  It's a metaphor, folks.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.942]  But let's just say there's a line of lovely ladies out the door.
[00:16:25.063 --> 00:16:28.445]  So I'm going to use that metaphor.
[00:16:28.465 --> 00:16:35.349]  I'm going to be very, very busy checking everything out and test driving everything before we get remarried here.
[00:16:35.909 --> 00:16:38.891]  But I'm not going to get a strategy or any of that, but if they think
[00:16:39.793 --> 00:16:40.713]  And then they know they have it.
[00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:42.353]  They just put out headlines to make it look like they're winning.
[00:16:42.694 --> 00:16:44.254]  They think they've silenced us and got nothing coming.
[00:16:44.654 --> 00:16:45.734]  So, that's coming up.
[00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:50.635]  Big stacks of articles on that.
[00:16:51.475 --> 00:16:52.975]  Absolutely critical, some of these quotes.
[00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:59.377]  Where they just say, yeah, he... In Reuters, he will not control his company.
[00:17:00.577 --> 00:17:02.077]  We do not want to make a deal with him.
[00:17:06.238 --> 00:17:06.878]  Unbelievable.
[00:17:08.012 --> 00:17:08.512]  Unbelievable.
[00:17:08.893 --> 00:17:13.276]  Right here in Reuters, because the other news is even more deceptive.
[00:17:13.296 --> 00:17:17.600]  There's some disinfo here, but I'd say 20% of this Reuters article's lies.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.684]  Folks, you read like the Daily Mail or the Daily Beast, it's like 90% total horse manure.
[00:17:22.944 --> 00:17:25.106]  I mean, it's indistinguishable from reality.
[00:17:25.406 --> 00:17:28.569]  So you read a Reuters article and you're like, wow, they actually got most of it right.
[00:17:29.269 --> 00:17:31.611]  So in this Reuters article, if you want to know what's going on, 80% of it,
[00:17:33.012 --> 00:17:34.212]  I'm going to read it on air.
[00:17:34.232 --> 00:17:35.232]  This is so interesting.
[00:17:35.592 --> 00:17:37.393]  Not just for Infowars, but understanding propaganda.
[00:17:37.933 --> 00:17:43.874]  What they say in here, they're like, well, they wanted a hundred million bucks and they wanted to control everything you did.
[00:17:44.254 --> 00:17:45.434]  Exactly what I've told you.
[00:17:46.655 --> 00:17:50.335]  And they quote the feds running it.
[00:17:51.235 --> 00:17:55.376]  Why are the feds on CNN and ABC News and NBC News, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times?
[00:17:55.716 --> 00:17:59.417]  Why is federal prosecutors and former federal prosecutors and former
[00:18:00.951 --> 00:18:02.171]  Why are they all in there?
[00:18:02.511 --> 00:18:04.072]  That's not even civil actions.
[00:18:04.372 --> 00:18:04.572]  Why?
[00:18:04.612 --> 00:18:05.812]  Because they ran it, folks.
[00:18:07.933 --> 00:18:09.753]  And look, I'm honored to be under this type of attack.
[00:18:10.573 --> 00:18:16.374]  All right, I'm already digressing because I said I was going to get to that later.
[00:18:16.394 --> 00:18:18.095]  I want to mention what else is coming up.
[00:18:18.555 --> 00:18:26.817]  Then I want to drill through all this news and who knows, maybe tomorrow I'll get into this.
[00:18:26.957 --> 00:18:27.497]  I mean, look,
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.824]  Nine days ago, I learned they were going to padlock the doors outside of a judge's order.
[00:18:36.304 --> 00:18:37.765]  That's how wild these people are.
[00:18:39.066 --> 00:18:42.388]  And of course, then it later came out in the news, okay, that was actually true four or five days later.
[00:18:42.968 --> 00:18:44.950]  And yeah, we want to shut it down right now, they said in court.
[00:18:46.527 --> 00:18:47.828]  People are like, wow, that's really bold.
[00:18:48.068 --> 00:18:48.588]  Uh, yeah.
[00:18:49.069 --> 00:18:54.312]  Convicting in a kangaroo court, the president of crimes and commits kind of wild too.
[00:18:54.952 --> 00:19:00.415]  Open borders, 20-something million illegals running around raping, murdering, killing.
[00:19:00.776 --> 00:19:06.419]  Now they're in New York, jumping out in front of cars on record to get hit by cars, stabbing police, shooting people everywhere.
[00:19:06.739 --> 00:19:07.680]  Yeah, it's kind of hard to believe.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:16.606]  Kind of hard to believe the United States is giving heavy weapons, and a week ago, NATO is running it, starts bombing Russian cities.
[00:19:18.107 --> 00:19:18.928]  Kind of hard to believe.
[00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.672]  It's all kind of hard to believe.
[00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:28.975]  But it's happening.
[00:19:30.717 --> 00:19:31.437]  So we've got that.
[00:19:31.457 --> 00:19:31.997]  I mean, here it is.
[00:19:32.818 --> 00:19:33.619]  Overhead shot if you can.
[00:19:34.514 --> 00:19:36.435]  New crime wave hits New York City.
[00:19:36.455 --> 00:19:38.175]  Illegal migrants, they're illegal aliens.
[00:19:38.695 --> 00:19:40.416]  Why do we always use their words?
[00:19:40.736 --> 00:19:44.897]  Deliberately jumping in front of cars to extort money from terrified drivers.
[00:19:46.617 --> 00:19:53.179]  Anybody who's lived in Texas, at least the last 20, 30 years, I've been here my whole life, knows illegal aliens pull out in front of you and they slam their brakes on.
[00:19:54.019 --> 00:19:54.979]  That's their specialty.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.161]  There are other groups that do it as well, but this is just total insanity.
[00:20:00.061 --> 00:20:00.661]  So we've got that.
[00:20:02.486 --> 00:20:03.527]  And we've got this.
[00:20:04.087 --> 00:20:05.248]  Great job, Steven Crowder.
[00:20:06.429 --> 00:20:09.111]  Five months ago, breaking this, and the media tried to suppress it.
[00:20:10.272 --> 00:20:17.637]  But now the police that gave him the information, or the sources, said, if it doesn't ever come out, we're going to release it all.
[00:20:17.697 --> 00:20:19.038]  And they did at a local newspaper.
[00:20:19.659 --> 00:20:25.043]  Transgender death cult commando, wanted to kill Christians, wanted to kill people at the school because
[00:20:26.192 --> 00:20:32.917]  Haiti Christianity was a crazy woman on a bunch of drugs that wanted to be a man who had special federal grants to buy the weapons.
[00:20:34.698 --> 00:20:36.880]  Sounds like MKUltra to me.
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:41.443]  Report transgender who killed six at national school, bought guns with federal grant money.
[00:20:43.084 --> 00:20:47.988]  Yeah, Adam Lanza reportedly interned at the CIA, but you never hear his name in all these news articles.
[00:20:48.808 --> 00:20:50.590]  A lot of these news articles about me and Sandy Hook
[00:20:52.179 --> 00:20:55.422]  Just say Alex Jones because of Sandy Hook has to pay 1.5 billion dollars.
[00:20:55.942 --> 00:20:57.463]  People actually think I killed these kids.
[00:20:59.045 --> 00:21:03.268]  And at some point I'm going to release the information, but I figured out why they got so upset at me.
[00:21:03.949 --> 00:21:15.259]  Because we were on to what really happened with the Men in the Woods and the camo, and the stand down and the school being closed, and all of that, that I've even had locals call that are liberals and say it was closed.
[00:21:16.072 --> 00:21:19.377]  It was because kids really died there, folks.
[00:21:19.477 --> 00:21:21.339]  But the official story you've been told is not it.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:22.361]  So don't worry.
[00:21:22.421 --> 00:21:23.943]  I've now figured all this out.
[00:21:25.184 --> 00:21:30.271]  And very soon, it's how we got set up and everything else.
[00:21:30.912 --> 00:21:32.434]  It's just absolutely insane.
[00:21:33.527 --> 00:21:54.413]  But it's very, very similar to what happened with Pizzagate that's in the WikiLeaks and real pedophilia and Aleister Crowley stuff and John Podesta and when they're gonna deliver the seven-year-olds to him and the Democrats at the farm, at the mansion, with the pool for his entertainment.
[00:21:54.453 --> 00:21:55.994]  That was all in the WikiLeaks, undisputed.
[00:21:56.714 --> 00:22:00.295]  So CNN focused instead
[00:22:02.282 --> 00:22:05.765]  And the New York Times on 4chan reporting on a pizza place.
[00:22:06.265 --> 00:22:11.629]  They had weird art and some of the same people going there, but nothing really proven happening there and no basement.
[00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:15.132]  Everybody else covers it and the media says we're the ones that made it up.
[00:22:15.512 --> 00:22:16.393]  It's the same story.
[00:22:16.893 --> 00:22:19.375]  They get their operatives to go out and put out this info story.
[00:22:19.656 --> 00:22:23.759]  We just nonchalantly, oh this is what people are saying on the internet with 50 million, 100 million views.
[00:22:24.119 --> 00:22:27.081]  Then we get attributed to it and then what does it do?
[00:22:27.121 --> 00:22:29.063]  It distracts from the real thing that really went on.
[00:22:31.397 --> 00:22:34.860]  Absolutely incredible information, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:39.564 --> 00:22:41.426]  Now, that's coming up too.
[00:22:43.588 --> 00:22:55.799]  But at the same time, you've got Cohen saying Trump's going to take your guns and put you in FEMA camps, but we do have a responsibility to actually go after the globalists for the crimes they've committed.
[00:22:58.766 --> 00:23:00.388]  They're trying to set us up, put us in prison.
[00:23:00.768 --> 00:23:04.613]  They're forming dictatorship, a fascist communist coup against America.
[00:23:04.913 --> 00:23:15.425]  We have a responsibility once back in power to kick the globalist criminals out of the Justice Department and actually go after the ringleaders of the New World Order to turn this around and stop it or this is going to go on forever.
[00:23:16.646 --> 00:23:18.428]  Do we have the clip of Steve Bannon?
[00:23:19.769 --> 00:23:20.130]  Here it is.
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.301]  They can't stop it.
[00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:34.026]  Why is Andrew McKay, Mr. Tough Guy, Mr. FBI Tough Guy, why is he wetting himself, why is he wet himself on national TV?
[00:23:34.366 --> 00:23:37.589]  He's damn scared, because he understands the end is near.
[00:23:38.429 --> 00:23:43.093]  So brother, you and all the other people, the torturous, these are torturous conversations we're having.
[00:23:43.393 --> 00:23:44.294]  Don't torture yourself!
[00:23:45.168 --> 00:23:45.989]  Don't torture yourself.
[00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:51.252]  Get your passport, get the hell out of the country, because hey, we're coming, we're going to grab the long arm of the law.
[00:23:51.832 --> 00:23:53.133]  Going to grab you back, bro.
[00:23:53.673 --> 00:23:54.994]  Totally constitutional.
[00:23:55.475 --> 00:24:01.378]  And inside the rule of law, which what you didn't do in trying to destroy this republic, you're going to get a taste of American justice.
[00:24:02.659 --> 00:24:03.680]  American justice.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.161]  By the rule of law.
[00:24:05.261 --> 00:24:06.642]  Based on English common law.
[00:24:07.222 --> 00:24:08.183]  And guess what, bro?
[00:24:08.223 --> 00:24:09.544]  You ain't going to like it one bit.
[00:24:09.604 --> 00:24:12.826]  Your crimes and your treason, Comey, all of you.
[00:24:14.624 --> 00:24:15.425]  Go ahead.
[00:24:15.585 --> 00:24:16.828]  Go to the ends of the earth.
[00:24:16.888 --> 00:24:22.158]  We will hunt you down and bring you back and you will stand accountable before the American people.
[00:24:23.106 --> 00:24:28.328]  And this is the party that fought what you guys wanted on the Pfizer requirements.
[00:24:28.468 --> 00:24:36.630]  All the lawlessness you've done to aspiring Americans, what you've done with the big tech oligarchs and the tech feudalism, we're not prepared to give this republic up.
[00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:37.850]  And we're not going to give it up.
[00:24:38.531 --> 00:24:40.251]  We're certainly not going to give it up without a fight.
[00:24:40.651 --> 00:24:41.832]  And that's what you've got right now.
[00:24:41.932 --> 00:24:50.594]  And hey, note to self, ruling class, and the sociopathic overlords that run this country, and the credential class that kiss their ass and take their pay, right?
[00:24:50.634 --> 00:24:52.695]  And the proletariat that they've destroyed underneath it.
[00:24:53.815 --> 00:24:55.056]  We're freeing the proletariat.
[00:24:55.456 --> 00:24:57.436]  We're going to free the working class in this country.
[00:24:57.596 --> 00:25:03.258]  Not going to be controlled by you, not going to be controlled by your propaganda, not going to be controlled by any of it.
[00:25:03.898 --> 00:25:05.759]  They're going to get liberty and they're going to get freedom.
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:11.981]  And the party that delivers that to them governs for a hundred years and you can see it.
[00:25:12.101 --> 00:25:14.542]  I preached this for years and you see it coming right now.
[00:25:15.182 --> 00:25:16.963]  Don't take it from me, take it from Amber Rose.
[00:25:18.308 --> 00:25:22.969]  Yeah, this could be the new American renaissance that we are about to see.
[00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:35.672]  And Steve Bannon reports to prison for contempt of the kangaroo illegally constituted Jan 6 Commission that the Democrats picked all the members on.
[00:25:35.712 --> 00:25:36.832]  That's illegal.
[00:25:37.652 --> 00:25:45.774]  And then they destroyed all the videos and all the depositions with myself and everybody else because they didn't want anybody to have the real record of what their investigation found.
[00:25:46.932 --> 00:25:49.935]  Undercover police, undercover feds, they're the provocateur.
[00:25:49.955 --> 00:25:55.559]  While Trump was giving a speech, Trump had an area set, a stage that we'd gone and gotten for him.
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.761]  We were set up and then told, bring him there.
[00:25:57.801 --> 00:25:59.443]  We get there, no police are there, nobody.
[00:25:59.703 --> 00:26:01.744]  There's already 100,000 people trying to get there.
[00:26:02.085 --> 00:26:05.888]  And then feds break through and wave them in and open the doors and wave everybody in.
[00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:07.649]  The rest is history.
[00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.051]  But I understand the key here.
[00:26:10.071 --> 00:26:11.192]  We're going to talk about this when we come back.
[00:26:11.673 --> 00:26:13.654]  The globalists don't want me on air.
[00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:18.373]  When they stage their next provocateur attempt at a civil war and civil unrest.
[00:26:19.113 --> 00:26:32.843]  They don't want me on a bigger scale on this show, with a megaphone like I did there, getting tens of thousands not to go in the Capitol, running around for an hour, climbing up on top of planters and chairs and cars and, you know, don't go in!
[00:26:32.943 --> 00:26:33.303]  Stop!
[00:26:33.363 --> 00:26:33.884]  It's dangerous!
[00:26:33.904 --> 00:26:34.524]  You're being set up!
[00:26:34.584 --> 00:26:35.165]  Kent State!
[00:26:37.626 --> 00:26:40.789]  And thousands could hear me, but my bullhorn only went so far and didn't go in.
[00:26:41.229 --> 00:26:42.310]  I said, go around the other side!
[00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:43.070]  We've got a stage!
[00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.671]  Trump's coming!
[00:26:44.676 --> 00:26:45.977]  The Secret Service wouldn't bring Trump.
[00:26:47.458 --> 00:26:55.623]  So they don't want me on air with all the shenanigans and all the chicanery and all the skullduggery that is about to go down.
[00:26:56.983 --> 00:26:59.005]  And that's why they desperately want me off air now.
[00:27:00.165 --> 00:27:01.126]  And they're complete fools.
[00:27:02.287 --> 00:27:03.407]  Absolute complete fools.
[00:27:04.368 --> 00:27:06.309]  Because it's just going to backfire.
[00:27:08.813 --> 00:27:19.657]  They don't care because they're planning an internet kill switch, a cyber attack, something along that order, massive war, financial collapse, maybe all of it at once in the next 140-something days ahead of Trump.
[00:27:20.197 --> 00:27:23.178]  I'm just one target they're trying to take out to clear the board.
[00:27:23.759 --> 00:27:26.700]  So, I'm a canary in the coal mine, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:35.823]  I'm like a sentry out, you know, not on the parapet of the castle, but up over the hill with a watchtower to look down in the valley to see if an enemy's coming up at night.
[00:27:37.199 --> 00:27:41.620]  And I'm supposed to light a big fire up there if I see enemy soldiers.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:50.702]  And I've got three or four arrows shot at me because their guys snuck up at night and... But I still had the torch and hit the watchtower.
[00:27:53.943 --> 00:27:54.643]  Literally, that's the analogy.
[00:27:54.663 --> 00:28:05.385]  I've stumbled over to the watchtower with the arrows in me to light the watchtower so that five miles away the castle knows there's an enemy force coming through the valley about to come over the hill and attack the fortress.
[00:28:06.604 --> 00:28:10.945]  And I am just honored to have that metaphor and to describe it that way.
[00:28:11.005 --> 00:28:11.865]  I appreciate the crew.
[00:28:12.205 --> 00:28:12.605]  Pray for them.
[00:28:12.625 --> 00:28:15.446]  They did a great job putting up with me and fighting so hard over the years.
[00:28:15.486 --> 00:28:17.226]  And I am beyond angry.
[00:28:17.387 --> 00:28:18.267]  I am frustrated.
[00:28:18.827 --> 00:28:20.067]  And I see our enemies celebrating.
[00:28:20.207 --> 00:28:23.108]  Oh, look, Jones cried about his operation being shut down.
[00:28:23.568 --> 00:28:24.508]  That's all out of context.
[00:28:24.608 --> 00:28:29.389]  I just had been on air seven hours at the time last Saturday with total treachery going on.
[00:28:29.649 --> 00:28:31.930]  And that's emotion, not fear or cowardice.
[00:28:33.194 --> 00:28:40.197]  Me saying I'm so sad for World War 3 in America and the tyranny and it's just the emotion overwhelms me and tears come to my eyes.
[00:28:42.197 --> 00:28:44.238]  Sure, there's grief, but that's not why I was crying.
[00:28:44.278 --> 00:28:48.619]  It was the overwhelming pain of understanding what we're all about to go through.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.300]  Lighting the watchtowers.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.180]  Watchmen on the wall.
[00:28:51.941 --> 00:28:52.941]  All along the watchtower.
[00:28:52.961 --> 00:28:54.562]  I love you so much, all of you.
[00:28:54.582 --> 00:28:55.102]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:55.122 --> 00:28:55.482]  Stay with us.
[00:29:00.734 --> 00:29:12.366]  As we continue to wait and hope that more and more people wake up every single day, some that took the bait are now starting to realize that we, the COVID unvaccinated, weren't all wrong.
[00:29:13.066 --> 00:29:16.390]  This is that message to you, the unvaccinated.
[00:29:20.126 --> 00:29:27.289]  Even if I were pollinated and fully vaccinated, I would admire the unvaccinated for withstanding the greatest pressure I've ever seen.
[00:29:28.009 --> 00:29:33.351]  From partners, parents, children, friends, colleagues, and even doctors.
[00:29:33.471 --> 00:29:37.473]  COVID vaccines are now available for children five years and older.
[00:29:37.553 --> 00:29:38.513]  Just get vaccinated.
[00:29:38.553 --> 00:29:39.473]  Get the vaccine.
[00:29:39.614 --> 00:29:40.934]  Just get the vaccine!
[00:29:41.014 --> 00:29:48.597]  People who are capable of such personality, courage, and critical ability are undoubtedly the best part of humanity.
[00:29:48.697 --> 00:29:56.723]  There are many thousands of physicians who have been silenced from telling the American people the good news about the situation, that we can manage the virus.
[00:29:56.843 --> 00:30:02.087]  They are everywhere, in all ages, levels of education, states, and ideas.
[00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:04.128]  They are of a special kind.
[00:30:04.188 --> 00:30:07.711]  They are the soldiers that every army of light wants to have in its ranks.
[00:30:08.111 --> 00:30:13.435]  They are the parent that every child wants to have, and the children that every parent dreams of having.
[00:30:13.755 --> 00:30:22.657]  A North Carolina teenager needs a new kidney in order to save her life, but her doctors say no COVID vaccine, no transplant.
[00:30:22.797 --> 00:30:24.538]  Vaccinated person having a heart attack?
[00:30:24.558 --> 00:30:25.438]  Yes, come right on in.
[00:30:25.478 --> 00:30:26.258]  We'll take care of you.
[00:30:26.478 --> 00:30:29.199]  Unvaccinated guy who gobbled horse goo?
[00:30:29.339 --> 00:30:30.379]  Rest in peace, Weezy.
[00:30:30.659 --> 00:30:33.420]  They are beings above the average of their societies.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.021]  You need to evaluate the risk factor in the COVID vaccine.
[00:30:37.321 --> 00:30:42.985]  They are the essence of the people who have, well, built all cultures and conquered horizons.
[00:30:43.765 --> 00:30:45.286]  They are there, next to you.
[00:30:45.506 --> 00:30:48.308]  They look normal, but they are superheroes.
[00:30:48.888 --> 00:30:50.089]  They did what others could not.
[00:30:50.689 --> 00:30:56.133]  They were the tree that withstood the hurricane of insults, discrimination, and social exclusion.
[00:30:56.333 --> 00:31:01.636]  Now what really stands out about white anti-vaxxers in particular is that they act like their freedom has been taken!
[00:31:01.656 --> 00:31:03.117]  It has nothing to do with freedom!
[00:31:03.417 --> 00:31:04.578]  Screw your freedom!
[00:31:04.758 --> 00:31:08.760]  You don't have the freedom and the liberty to put other people in jeopardy.
[00:31:09.121 --> 00:31:11.282]  Banned from their family's tables at Christmas?
[00:31:11.782 --> 00:31:13.884]  They never saw anything so cruel.
[00:31:14.064 --> 00:31:17.246]  If someone in your family isn't vaccinated, should you ask them not to show up?
[00:31:17.866 --> 00:31:19.287]  Yes, I would do that.
[00:31:19.487 --> 00:31:21.528]  If you are not fully vaxxed, stay home.
[00:31:21.808 --> 00:31:27.612]  Everyone from police to teachers to firefighters must comply or they will face penalties.
[00:31:28.117 --> 00:31:31.618]  They lost their jobs, let their careers sink, had no more money.
[00:31:32.119 --> 00:31:38.261]  They suffered immeasurable discrimination, denunciation, betrayal, and humiliation, but they kept on going.
[00:31:38.801 --> 00:31:41.722]  Never before in humanity has there been such a casting.
[00:31:42.142 --> 00:31:45.844]  Now, we all know who are the best on the planet Earth.
[00:31:46.644 --> 00:31:56.308]  Men, women, young, old, rich, poor of all races or religions, the unvaccinated, the chosen of the invisible arc, the only ones who managed to resist when everything collapsed.
[00:31:57.128 --> 00:31:57.628]  That's you!
[00:31:58.469 --> 00:32:06.712]  You passed an unimaginable test that many of the toughest marines, commandos, green berets, astronauts, and even geniuses could not withstand.
[00:32:07.292 --> 00:32:10.134]  You are made of the stuff of the greatest who ever lived.
[00:32:10.534 --> 00:32:13.855]  Those heroes born among ordinary men who glow in the dark.
[00:32:14.516 --> 00:32:17.377]  Remember, you're the voice, and it's time to make it count.
[00:32:35.597 --> 00:32:36.598]  What did he just say?
[00:32:37.898 --> 00:32:44.382]  He said there's a storm coming in.
[00:32:44.522 --> 00:32:45.823]  I know.
[00:32:46.664 --> 00:32:50.166]  We told you what was going to happen, and it did.
[00:32:50.746 --> 00:32:53.088]  Now we're telling you what's coming.
[00:32:53.968 --> 00:32:56.550]  At Real Alex Jones on X.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:09.102]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:18.805 --> 00:33:25.507]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:33:25.747 --> 00:33:27.808]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:33:30.014 --> 00:33:34.938]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:36.419 --> 00:33:38.621]  Alright, welcome back folks.
[00:33:38.641 --> 00:33:45.266]  I want to hit the really good news coming out of Europe, and the rest of the world, where populists and nationalists are being elected everywhere.
[00:33:46.027 --> 00:33:47.428]  The New World Order is in deep trouble.
[00:33:47.448 --> 00:33:48.509]  We're just sweeping everywhere.
[00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:58.457]  That's what the deep state, this global black rock, IMF, World Bank, Rothschild, Rockefeller, combine is totally panicking, throwing out.
[00:33:59.969 --> 00:34:00.569]  All the stops.
[00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:03.351]  And just going crazy.
[00:34:04.192 --> 00:34:06.774]  So yeah, it's a good thing this is happening, but the empire's gonna strike back.
[00:34:07.734 --> 00:34:19.182]  And I'm gonna show you in AP and Reuters and mainstream news where they go, plaintiffs, which are just being used by the deep state that now is publicly running this, the FBI, CIA now admits it.
[00:34:20.023 --> 00:34:22.505]  They've got federal prosecutors bragging about it in these articles.
[00:34:22.545 --> 00:34:23.906]  It's insane how arrogant they are.
[00:34:23.946 --> 00:34:24.986]  They hide it in plain view.
[00:34:26.568 --> 00:34:28.349]  They just say, in this huge stack right here,
[00:34:29.878 --> 00:34:37.241]  In AP, in Reuters, Mr. Jones would not let them take control of his companies and be in control of them and what he said and did.
[00:34:37.942 --> 00:34:38.982]  I've told you that for months.
[00:34:39.562 --> 00:34:45.405]  They said, we want 100 billion bucks, and we want to control your company and run it.
[00:34:46.045 --> 00:34:46.866]  It's a non-starter.
[00:34:47.206 --> 00:34:53.689]  So the judge said, fine, I'll give it back to you, to me, this Friday, and then they're going to sit in the state court and shut us down.
[00:34:54.636 --> 00:34:55.997]  So I said, fine, I'll kick it.
[00:34:56.217 --> 00:35:06.026]  I'll agree to keep it in federal court because that'll take a little time to drag out and we can expose more of this because I'll take a week, a month, you know, two months, three months.
[00:35:06.627 --> 00:35:07.247]  It could be longer.
[00:35:07.267 --> 00:35:13.473]  We got some maneuvers here because it isn't about keeping us on the air forever.
[00:35:13.533 --> 00:35:16.936]  It's about fighting to the last minute and getting everything done we can.
[00:35:17.236 --> 00:35:20.439]  And so my brain is totally turned up on high.
[00:35:22.185 --> 00:35:26.427]  When it comes to everything happening, because the world is in such a precarious situation.
[00:35:26.467 --> 00:35:27.367]  But I'm going to say this right now.
[00:35:29.288 --> 00:35:37.230]  If you get your orders in at InfoWarsTore.com with the great products you already like, and the big summer super sale that's going on right now, 40% off, you will get them.
[00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:41.232]  We're not going to shut down for a few weeks, but it could be your last chance to get them.
[00:35:42.048 --> 00:35:52.060]  Okay, and that's great, and maybe they try to settle last minute and say, fine, you know, we'll take an amount of money you can pay, which I don't even care about, and then we won't try to control what you say, and I'll go boom, I settle.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.663]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:35:55.304 --> 00:35:59.850]  So, but there can be a catch-22 where if we don't get any money coming in, we don't have a lot of extra money.
[00:36:01.052 --> 00:36:02.813]  Then we can shut down just because I don't plug that.
[00:36:03.313 --> 00:36:07.155]  I'm faithful to the end of M4 Wars, even though it's on its deathbed and on a respirator.
[00:36:07.696 --> 00:36:08.356]  You want to support it?
[00:36:08.916 --> 00:36:09.657]  Great, great products.
[00:36:09.697 --> 00:36:10.197]  Last chance.
[00:36:10.677 --> 00:36:14.139]  I think you're safe to get them right now, but in a week or so, I'll probably be saying something different.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.280]  I'll know everything Friday, okay?
[00:36:17.401 --> 00:36:19.142]  But we ship out like a day after the order comes in.
[00:36:19.162 --> 00:36:21.723]  So you order tonight, probably go out tomorrow or Tuesday for sure.
[00:36:22.524 --> 00:36:23.524]  M4WarsStore.com.
[00:36:24.225 --> 00:36:24.465]  All right?
[00:36:26.604 --> 00:36:31.228]  Now, what isn't InfoWarsTore.com is DrJonesNaturals.com.
[00:36:31.728 --> 00:36:35.531]  My father over two years ago said, this is deep state.
[00:36:36.151 --> 00:36:38.133]  He helped set up the supplements 12 years ago.
[00:36:38.153 --> 00:36:39.034]  He's super smart.
[00:36:39.054 --> 00:36:40.655]  He taught me so much of what I know growing up.
[00:36:40.855 --> 00:36:41.636]  Super smart man.
[00:36:42.456 --> 00:36:43.537]  My mother wanted him to retire.
[00:36:44.258 --> 00:36:46.840]  He went and got a warehouse in Round Rock, North Austin.
[00:36:48.421 --> 00:36:50.843]  He kept producing all the great products that he designed for us.
[00:36:52.028 --> 00:36:58.715]  And sure enough, three months ago they said, all your products you sell here that he's only taking a small percentage of, we're not going to sell those anymore because of the CRO and the court.
[00:36:58.875 --> 00:36:59.116]  Fine.
[00:36:59.436 --> 00:37:02.559]  They kicked his products out of our warehouse, and he got them.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:08.025]  So all these products you couldn't get at fullworkstore.com anymore, there's so many of them, they're at drjonesandactuals.com.
[00:37:08.306 --> 00:37:09.487]  And that's just the inside baseball.
[00:37:09.507 --> 00:37:10.788]  So that's a separate company.
[00:37:11.149 --> 00:37:13.731]  It's not going anywhere right now unless we have nuclear war with the Russians next week.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:24.990]  They're shipping, they got good quality, they got good customer service, and wherever we go in the future, whatever happens, that's my dad's company, and he's going to be a sponsor for the future.
[00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:39.484]  So, great products, and at this critical time, like Travis sitting on a letter at the Alamo for aid, I'm asking all of you to mark it down, to remember the site, to make it your homepage, and to go there and get next-level foundational energy.
[00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:52.879]  Get the concentrated fiber caps that are the essence of the best seeds, not just the wheatgrass, but a bunch of others that do incredible things for your whole gut and regularity in your immune system and resetting your gut.
[00:37:53.419 --> 00:37:54.020]  It's all there.
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.481]  Some of the products are 40% off.
[00:37:56.822 --> 00:37:58.843]  Cabochill, natural relaxation.
[00:37:59.383 --> 00:38:00.004]  It's amazing.
[00:38:00.744 --> 00:38:02.526]  Rocket Rest, incredible natural sleep aid.
[00:38:02.606 --> 00:38:04.087]  Top Brain, incredible nootropic.
[00:38:04.861 --> 00:38:06.703]  People take it and say, this is the best product you got.
[00:38:07.564 --> 00:38:11.129]  All the nano silver products, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:38:11.669 --> 00:38:13.451]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:16.555]  And my dad's a target of these people of the deep state.
[00:38:16.595 --> 00:38:17.216]  They've sued him.
[00:38:17.256 --> 00:38:17.977]  They've attacked him.
[00:38:17.997 --> 00:38:19.939]  In fact, they said, well, leave your family alone.
[00:38:19.959 --> 00:38:20.820]  Just do what we say.
[00:38:21.441 --> 00:38:22.843]  My mother told me, as I told you.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.002]  Six months ago, and she's not a, she's not a fire breather.
[00:38:27.042 --> 00:38:30.265]  She's not a battle ax, but she's a historian and really smart and taught me a lot.
[00:38:31.066 --> 00:38:34.549]  And she said, you know what the Spartans said about their warriors when they went out to battle?
[00:38:35.209 --> 00:38:37.091]  And I said, yeah, I'll come home with your shields are on.
[00:38:38.372 --> 00:38:38.692]  She said,
[00:38:39.853 --> 00:38:42.293]  And my dad and her just said, this is BS.
[00:38:42.494 --> 00:38:43.354]  We don't care what they do to us.
[00:38:43.774 --> 00:38:47.374]  We don't want you altering course because of threats against us and all the harassment.
[00:38:47.594 --> 00:38:51.635]  And my dad deposed 10 times and all the rest of it and all the money he spent battling.
[00:38:51.655 --> 00:38:54.816]  And they just said, son, never compromise on what you're doing.
[00:38:54.836 --> 00:38:56.036]  We're so proud of you.
[00:38:56.096 --> 00:38:57.916]  My parents are so proud of me.
[00:38:58.276 --> 00:38:59.357]  I'm so proud of them.
[00:39:00.077 --> 00:39:03.997]  And so help my parents plus get great products at the same time.
[00:39:04.538 --> 00:39:06.358]  And my dad, whatever we do is going to be a great sponsor.
[00:39:07.927 --> 00:39:09.367]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:11.088]  It takes money to fight the New World Order.
[00:39:11.128 --> 00:39:11.408]  Great.
[00:39:11.468 --> 00:39:14.749]  Trump's now raised... What is it now?
[00:39:14.769 --> 00:39:15.729]  $300 million?
[00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:19.870]  $400 million?
[00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:23.031]  That is wonderful in just a week and a half.
[00:39:23.771 --> 00:39:24.671]  We don't have that.
[00:39:25.471 --> 00:39:26.752]  We can't fight these people.
[00:39:26.772 --> 00:39:30.272]  And the New World Order knows this broadcast, because of you, got Trump elected.
[00:39:30.293 --> 00:39:33.493]  They know we're critical to seeing over the horizon and understand what's happening.
[00:39:33.553 --> 00:39:35.934]  So, to me, it's a no-brainer.
[00:39:37.102 --> 00:39:37.782]  It's on a soft sell.
[00:39:37.802 --> 00:39:38.543]  It's on a hard sell.
[00:39:38.563 --> 00:39:39.423]  These are great products.
[00:39:39.784 --> 00:39:40.824]  They're ready to ship right now.
[00:39:41.785 --> 00:39:43.766]  We're coming to the aid of you and our country together.
[00:39:44.046 --> 00:39:45.127]  We need you to come to our aid.
[00:39:45.207 --> 00:39:46.128]  Mutual defense here.
[00:39:46.568 --> 00:39:50.770]  I need you to make the decision as a new listener or a long-time listener to go, you know what?
[00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:52.271]  I'm going to drjonesnackles.com.
[00:39:52.531 --> 00:39:54.152]  I'm going to get that nano silver toothpaste.
[00:39:54.172 --> 00:39:58.035]  I'm going to get the tooth whitening toothpaste with no fluoride and all the key essential oils.
[00:39:58.435 --> 00:40:00.556]  I'm going to get the immune gargle.
[00:40:00.696 --> 00:40:02.818]  I'm going to get all the other amazing products.
[00:40:02.838 --> 00:40:05.539]  I'm going to check the site out and I'm going to get these products.
[00:40:05.559 --> 00:40:06.560]  I'm going to tell you, you're going to love them.
[00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:09.987]  It's now $400 million.
[00:40:10.027 --> 00:40:10.667]  I knew it was huge.
[00:40:11.768 --> 00:40:13.829]  I was saying it'd be a billion by July 4th.
[00:40:13.869 --> 00:40:19.211]  I've now estimated $1.2 billion.
[00:40:19.231 --> 00:40:21.412]  $400 million, and that was two days ago, three days ago.
[00:40:22.413 --> 00:40:23.273]  Thursday to Thursday.
[00:40:24.494 --> 00:40:26.215]  Word is it's over $500 million right now.
[00:40:26.335 --> 00:40:26.715]  Great!
[00:40:27.696 --> 00:40:28.216]  That's good.
[00:40:28.256 --> 00:40:28.816]  He needs that.
[00:40:29.556 --> 00:40:30.917]  Biden's got all the billionaires behind him.
[00:40:32.018 --> 00:40:33.578]  Outraising Trump 2 to 1, 3 to 1 in some cases.
[00:40:36.459 --> 00:40:38.903]  But, isn't InfoWars critical?
[00:40:39.865 --> 00:40:42.850]  And to get great products at the same time, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:40:44.696 --> 00:40:48.058]  And again, we've got signed, unsigned books.
[00:40:48.478 --> 00:40:50.559]  It's a support we're doing at mforswore.com.
[00:40:50.599 --> 00:40:50.980]  Go there.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:52.320]  It's historic.
[00:40:52.521 --> 00:40:53.841]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:40:53.861 --> 00:40:55.082]  Be sure to support mforswore.com.
[00:40:55.102 --> 00:40:58.124]  But the most critical is drjonesnatchels.com.
[00:40:58.144 --> 00:40:59.464]  I don't know how else to say it.
[00:40:59.805 --> 00:41:02.866]  We've been successful because of your prayer, your word of mouth, your financial support.
[00:41:03.227 --> 00:41:07.009]  I thank you for it, but take action now at drjonesnatchels.com.
[00:41:07.469 --> 00:41:10.231]  Just the initials, Dr. DrJonesNaturals.com.
[00:41:10.251 --> 00:41:13.272]  And I thank you all for your steadfast support.
[00:41:13.612 --> 00:41:19.296]  And I want to encourage those that are on the fence, because a tiny percent of our listeners never buy anything, to just take action now.
[00:41:19.316 --> 00:41:20.956]  You can see it's all on the table.
[00:41:21.457 --> 00:41:26.640]  Hiding, you know, not supporting is not going to help anybody, especially yourself.
[00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:27.800]  So thank you all for your support.
[00:41:28.461 --> 00:41:28.801]  Okay.
[00:41:33.523 --> 00:41:34.544]  Let's hit the good news here.
[00:41:37.079 --> 00:41:54.304]  I've already been harping on this, you already know about it, I'm not going to belabor it, but whether you're in Latin America, or Asia, or Africa, or where they can vote in the Middle East, particularly Europe, Canada, everywhere, nationalists, populists, anti-globalists, conservatives have been winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning.
[00:41:55.004 --> 00:41:58.585]  But because of the way the parliamentary systems work in most other countries,
[00:42:00.225 --> 00:42:01.965]  It's decades of globalist entrenchment.
[00:42:02.665 --> 00:42:11.347]  Just because the parties that are anti-New World Order in Germany and France have gone from 10 points five years ago to 30 points now, they're still not in control.
[00:42:11.407 --> 00:42:14.707]  It'll be the next election they get dominant control.
[00:42:16.228 --> 00:42:18.128]  And that's why the New World Order is in full panic mode.
[00:42:18.428 --> 00:42:19.248]  Here are some of the headlines.
[00:42:19.668 --> 00:42:29.370]  EU projection shows far-right parties making big gains in European elections as Greens suffer losses, and Communists and other little leftist coalition parties.
[00:42:30.919 --> 00:42:37.461]  So Marie Le Pen's Conservative Nationalist Party has more than doubled what they had just a few years ago at 50%.
[00:42:38.221 --> 00:42:38.901]  She's at 30%.
[00:42:39.662 --> 00:42:44.403]  And Macron is at 14 to 15, depending on the exit polls.
[00:42:45.103 --> 00:42:58.907]  In Germany, the most populous nation, the 27-member bloc, projections indicate that the extreme right alternative for Germany, AFD, overcame a huge amount of demonization and scandals involving the top candidate to rise 16.5% from 11%.
[00:43:01.954 --> 00:43:02.574]  We're good to go.
[00:43:32.295 --> 00:43:33.996]  Here's Infowars.com.
[00:43:35.216 --> 00:43:36.257]  Right-wing tsunami.
[00:43:36.797 --> 00:43:41.019]  Conservatives ascendant in Euro Parliament vote.
[00:43:41.059 --> 00:43:42.559]  Le Pen thrashes Macron.
[00:43:42.939 --> 00:43:45.600]  Germany's SPD suffers record rout.
[00:43:47.761 --> 00:43:50.242]  German far-right makes strong gains in EU vote.
[00:43:50.322 --> 00:43:51.423]  Ruling parties suffer.
[00:43:53.641 --> 00:44:02.489]  And all over Europe, particularly England, people are cutting down the face scanning cameras and the license plate reading cameras for the 15-minute cities.
[00:44:03.651 --> 00:44:16.663]  Just look up Blade Runners, U-L-E-Z camera, look up U-L-E-Z Blade Runners, and you will see hundreds of incredible videos a day of people, broad daylight, cutting them down, showing the power of humanity.
[00:44:18.567 --> 00:44:19.848]  And how is Germany responding?
[00:44:19.868 --> 00:44:21.149]  The government knows people are pissed.
[00:44:21.669 --> 00:44:25.391]  Germany to start forcibly deporting dangerous migrants after a cop dies in stabbing.
[00:44:25.711 --> 00:44:35.517]  We showed you this video last week where the cop tackles the guy that was trying to stop the illegal alien Islamic Syrian stabbing people.
[00:44:38.118 --> 00:44:45.383]  So the cop tackles him, the guy trying to stop it, and so the Islamic comes over and stabs the cop in the neck and the head, killing him.
[00:44:45.563 --> 00:44:45.923]  He died.
[00:44:48.288 --> 00:44:49.368]  And what did Facebook and everybody do?
[00:44:49.408 --> 00:44:50.229]  They took that video down.
[00:44:50.249 --> 00:44:51.429]  They want you to see what's happening.
[00:44:52.169 --> 00:44:54.150]  But now Germany's starting to act like they'll do something.
[00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:59.132]  Another Afghan migrant, illegal alien, attached a German police officer with a knife.
[00:45:02.313 --> 00:45:03.714]  Austrian defense minister.
[00:45:03.754 --> 00:45:05.634]  Western permission to strike targets in Russia.
[00:45:05.974 --> 00:45:09.016]  Crosses red line to total nuclear war.
[00:45:09.156 --> 00:45:09.876]  Must stop now.
[00:45:12.563 --> 00:45:15.385]  So, there's some of the intel on that front.
[00:45:15.425 --> 00:45:18.786]  It is a big, big, big, big deal.
[00:45:19.967 --> 00:45:24.969]  If we've got time to stop World War III and time to get control of our governments, we can turn this crap around.
[00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:30.652]  As Trump said in many of the speeches he's given, there's a real chance to stop this.
[00:45:30.672 --> 00:45:33.814]  But we've got to realize, we've got really evil people in control.
[00:45:33.854 --> 00:45:35.115]  In fact, let's play a clip.
[00:45:38.339 --> 00:45:42.723]  This is the hardest, darkest moment that you can think of in this journey you've been on in the last several years.
[00:46:07.606 --> 00:46:08.887]  You have to be very strong.
[00:46:10.087 --> 00:46:12.968]  You're fighting off very evil forces, and they're very smart forces.
[00:46:14.248 --> 00:46:16.589]  There are people that control Biden, totally true.
[00:46:16.629 --> 00:46:18.150]  I think I know who they are, largely.
[00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:19.730]  But there are people that control him.
[00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:21.611]  They're very smart, very energetic.
[00:46:23.132 --> 00:46:26.633]  Possibly they're real believers, you know, what their sick ideology is.
[00:46:27.853 --> 00:46:30.394]  It's a death cult, a world eugenics and humanist cult, yes.
[00:46:31.115 --> 00:46:32.335]  We're coming to consensus on that.
[00:46:32.395 --> 00:46:34.036]  Our work is paying off, getting the truth out.
[00:46:34.156 --> 00:46:34.696]  Thanks to all of you.
[00:46:35.976 --> 00:46:37.636]  So what broke the last week?
[00:46:39.077 --> 00:46:43.017]  British Medical Journal, hundreds of other scientist groups.
[00:46:44.038 --> 00:46:44.718]  Okay, it's true.
[00:46:44.738 --> 00:46:46.358]  The insurance company numbers are accurate.
[00:46:46.438 --> 00:46:49.659]  I've been reporting this number for a year because I was going off old actuaries.
[00:46:50.259 --> 00:46:52.319]  It always takes them a year to put out the latest year.
[00:46:52.959 --> 00:46:58.100]  So by 2021-2022, give them poison shots, it was over 20 million dead.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.721]  22 million is the high number, 18 million was the low number.
[00:47:01.596 --> 00:47:01.916]  We're good to go.
[00:47:32.435 --> 00:47:34.936]  They're like, why for a year it was 22 million, and now it's 35 million?
[00:47:36.497 --> 00:47:38.618]  It's getting worse, even though the shots have gone down.
[00:47:38.638 --> 00:47:41.099]  4% are taking them, not just here, but worldwide.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:43.040]  Same number everywhere.
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.981]  People tend to be the same, whether they're in Germany or the U.S.
[00:47:46.762 --> 00:47:50.664]  And it's not just a Dutch scientist says at least 35 million deaths have been caused by COVID.
[00:47:51.064 --> 00:47:54.806]  When you link through the articles, that's the new numbers that came out a week and a half ago.
[00:47:56.487 --> 00:47:59.068]  But here's the big enchilada on this baby.
[00:48:00.618 --> 00:48:03.560]  Breaking COVID mRNA jabs are not vaccines.
[00:48:03.741 --> 00:48:05.562]  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal rules.
[00:48:05.582 --> 00:48:06.283]  And what do they say?
[00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:07.323]  It's a big article.
[00:48:07.604 --> 00:48:09.285]  Jamie White, InfoWars.com.
[00:48:09.625 --> 00:48:11.387]  I posted on X with the court ruling.
[00:48:11.687 --> 00:48:21.955]  His article and the court ruling from X. The court ruling on X. In 1986, Ronald Reagan, who I think was a good guy overall, but on his watch passed the vaccine
[00:48:23.971 --> 00:48:24.671]  We're good to go.
[00:48:52.455 --> 00:48:56.557]  The problem is, what do they jack into as a Trojan horse, or what do they put in it on accident?
[00:48:57.057 --> 00:49:01.519]  SV40 cancer virus, as they said, was an accident, but they keep adding even the COVID shot, it's not an accident.
[00:49:01.979 --> 00:49:03.700]  Number one cause of cancer is SV40, look it up.
[00:49:04.681 --> 00:49:07.742]  Simian virus 40.
[00:49:10.023 --> 00:49:18.107]  So, a year before, in 2019, the CDC and the Centers for Infectious Disease
[00:49:20.453 --> 00:49:28.616]  Subgroup that Fauci was running changed on their website the definition to anything we put in your body that changes your body.
[00:49:28.916 --> 00:49:29.616]  You can look it up.
[00:49:30.756 --> 00:49:33.097]  That's not a legal definition.
[00:49:33.117 --> 00:49:34.257]  It wasn't passed by Congress.
[00:49:35.018 --> 00:49:40.639]  So now the Ninth Circuit hearing all this said, no, you don't basically have immunity.
[00:49:40.679 --> 00:49:41.660]  That's why this was being done.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:42.500]  It's going forward.
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:48.562]  You can't just change the definition yourself and then say whatever you give somebody a gene therapy,
[00:49:50.478 --> 00:49:55.520]  Last week, Bill Gates says, we're going to give all the cows shots where they never produce methane again, and it mutates their guts.
[00:49:56.781 --> 00:50:06.466]  How the hell do you give something a shot that mutates their intestines where they never produce methane again, when that's how a cow breaks down cellulose, breaks down grass into something it can process?
[00:50:08.627 --> 00:50:11.728]  They're mutating your body while you're alive, folks.
[00:50:11.748 --> 00:50:12.448]  That's called cancer.
[00:50:14.169 --> 00:50:14.970]  This is a big article.
[00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:16.050]  Big story.
[00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:17.331]  Put it on screen.
[00:50:17.371 --> 00:50:17.911]  Great job, crew.
[00:50:18.744 --> 00:50:21.625]  From X. No one has to go to next, they already have it up.
[00:50:23.166 --> 00:50:30.048]  So, again, it's all a lie from the first letter of it.
[00:50:31.369 --> 00:50:32.930]  So they're admitting the shot doesn't work.
[00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:34.530]  They're admitting it destroys your immune system.
[00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:36.411]  They're admitting it's killed tens of millions of people.
[00:50:37.151 --> 00:50:41.893]  And now, they're saying lawsuits can go forward because you don't have immunity.
[00:50:42.153 --> 00:50:44.114]  The law says it's for vaccines.
[00:50:46.837 --> 00:50:58.546]  For smallpox, or chickenpox, or measles, or hepatitis, or the flu, this isn't that.
[00:50:58.646 --> 00:51:03.289]  You can't come and change the name outside of law, and then bomb people with this.
[00:51:08.133 --> 00:51:15.338]  Well, the CRO, eight days ago, nine days ago, couldn't just, without a court order, shut this place down, but they tried.
[00:51:18.015 --> 00:51:18.315]  I don't know.
[00:51:38.576 --> 00:51:42.099]  Imagine all the other crap going on on the big scale to you with this.
[00:51:42.499 --> 00:51:43.400]  I mean, take the military.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:47.283]  Yeah, you join the military, an approved vaccine, they can make you take it.
[00:51:47.523 --> 00:51:48.864]  They can't make anybody else take it.
[00:51:49.665 --> 00:51:52.847]  Under the law, but you can make the military, that's in the contract you sign.
[00:51:53.928 --> 00:52:00.834]  But under the law, there's been anthrax shots, a bunch of cases of this in the last 40 years, swine flu, you name it, shots.
[00:52:00.914 --> 00:52:04.176]  You can't make them take an unapproved experimental shot.
[00:52:05.878 --> 00:52:07.219]  Now that's all come out in court, been confirmed.
[00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:10.991]  But they purged the military with it and injured and killed a bunch of other people.
[00:52:11.332 --> 00:52:18.355]  They got a 900% increase in heart failure in the Navy's service people.
[00:52:20.156 --> 00:52:21.897]  It's over a thousand in the general military.
[00:52:22.377 --> 00:52:24.138]  Think of the numbers I'm giving you.
[00:52:24.158 --> 00:52:27.379]  So the Ninth Circuit says this is not a vaccine.
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:29.120]  Boom!
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:29.400]  Boom!
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:29.500]  Boom!
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:30.621]  Boom!
[00:52:35.695 --> 00:52:43.741]  I'm fine with a billion and a half dollars with no jury trial, found guilty in a jury trial how guilty I was, how much I owed, for saying things I never said.
[00:52:46.123 --> 00:52:46.824]  Billion and a half dollars.
[00:52:47.404 --> 00:52:54.510]  Fauci gets up and says masks don't work, now they work, no they don't work, 100% they don't work, oh the vaccine's 100% effective, no it's not effective.
[00:52:56.912 --> 00:53:01.896]  We'll get to this after the guest comes on, last 30 minutes, but it's just absolutely insane.
[00:53:01.956 --> 00:53:03.557]  So let's look at some of these other articles.
[00:53:06.593 --> 00:53:10.903]  Mexico says bird flu patient died of chronic disease, not virus.
[00:53:11.404 --> 00:53:14.090]  I went and read that the patient was on death's doorstep.
[00:53:18.377 --> 00:53:26.120]  Medical group comes in, sticks a PCR test on him that they turned up on high, where a tomato would say it had bird flu and said, oh, he died of bird flu.
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.701]  So he came into his dead body and said that.
[00:53:28.761 --> 00:53:29.981]  I told you that over a week ago.
[00:53:30.481 --> 00:53:30.982]  Here it is.
[00:53:31.802 --> 00:53:34.343]  Yahoo News, AP Reuters, Mexican government press release.
[00:53:34.383 --> 00:53:35.403]  He did not die of bird flu.
[00:53:35.723 --> 00:53:36.984]  They say he probably didn't even have bird flu.
[00:53:37.004 --> 00:53:37.724]  It's a PCR test.
[00:53:39.474 --> 00:53:43.756]  Ambulance influenza, Mexico, disease outbreak news, World Health Organization.
[00:53:44.816 --> 00:53:48.078]  A man in Mexico died with one form of bird flu, but U.S.
[00:53:48.098 --> 00:53:49.419]  officials remain focused on another.
[00:53:49.779 --> 00:54:01.764]  So here's the Hill still reporting the horse crap, even as the Mexican government says he died of other complications, and he was dead when they tested him.
[00:54:03.645 --> 00:54:05.406]  So that's the level of horse crap
[00:54:08.612 --> 00:54:16.780]  You're being fed just like somebody would die in a motorcycle accident, or an 18-wheeler accident, or a farming accident, or be shot.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.782]  Because I would read the death certificates on there.
[00:54:18.802 --> 00:54:22.206]  I remember three years ago, they'd say, oh my god, this guy died.
[00:54:22.226 --> 00:54:31.435]  You know, when you go look at the death certificates later, it'd be like, died in a motorcycle, died in a shooting, died of suicide, died of cancer, died of a brain tumor, died of a heart attack.
[00:54:32.745 --> 00:54:33.265]  They counted them.
[00:54:33.285 --> 00:54:41.707]  Remember, they also said there was no flu in 2020, because they needed to count every dead person that died as from COVID to create the fear.
[00:54:42.147 --> 00:54:44.388]  Once the shots began, then the real death began.
[00:54:44.408 --> 00:54:44.928]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:54:45.288 --> 00:54:49.329]  Man who died in a motorcycle crash counted as COVID death in Florida.
[00:54:50.269 --> 00:54:51.249]  So, let's move on now.
[00:54:51.269 --> 00:54:54.090]  We've got a special guest coming up, this great Air Force colonel.
[00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:55.951]  And more of it was 30 minutes.
[00:54:56.731 --> 00:54:58.911]  And then I'm going to hit this story that I mentioned.
[00:54:58.971 --> 00:54:59.852]  It'll take about 10 minutes.
[00:54:59.892 --> 00:55:01.432]  I'll hit all the other stuff, because I've got a lot here.
[00:55:03.107 --> 00:55:04.347]  But this is really a big deal.
[00:55:04.407 --> 00:55:05.348]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:55:06.408 --> 00:55:09.589]  MTG and basically so many others, I couldn't even keep track of it.
[00:55:09.609 --> 00:55:12.789]  I mean, it was like 2 million retweets, you know, 1 million retweets.
[00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:16.310]  It was like tens of millions of people a day without even looking.
[00:55:18.791 --> 00:55:27.713]  Like MTG, the great MTG, were saying, well, wait, if Alex Jones was fined $1.5 million in a show trial for things he never said, why is it Fauci being sued?
[00:55:27.753 --> 00:55:29.033]  Why is it Fauci in jail?
[00:55:29.333 --> 00:55:32.234]  Why is it Fauci for creating gain-of-function bioweapons has been put in prison?
[00:55:33.254 --> 00:55:37.295]  MTG, if Alex Jones has 1.5 million for his information, how much does Fauci owe?
[00:55:39.576 --> 00:55:42.436]  Shanahook families agree to Alex Jones bankruptcy liquidation.
[00:55:42.736 --> 00:55:44.017]  They'd already filed this.
[00:55:46.257 --> 00:55:55.740]  But the key is in this Reuters article and others I've got where they go, look, we offered Jones, you know, 85, 100 million dollars and we would control his company and run it and control what he said.
[00:55:56.909 --> 00:55:57.430]  He disagreed.
[00:55:58.071 --> 00:55:59.232]  That's an offer you can't accept.
[00:55:59.292 --> 00:56:01.595]  It's the opposite of the Godfather, an offer you can't refuse.
[00:56:02.497 --> 00:56:14.493]  And I've told you that hundreds of times, and now they're in the news, quoted by name, saying we wanted to run his company, run what he could say, have a board of directors in there, and sit there and... Hell would freeze over.
[00:56:16.792 --> 00:56:22.235]  So I even felt bad saying, okay, I'll raise money just to tell the truth and still give you most of it.
[00:56:22.856 --> 00:56:25.517]  But when I said no is when they said, we want to control what you say.
[00:56:25.777 --> 00:56:27.719]  And I said, no, hell no, never.
[00:56:28.139 --> 00:56:35.003]  And I would never imagine when they said that in these meetings with them, that we're supposedly, you know, off record, the judge says it's all off record.
[00:56:35.803 --> 00:56:38.005]  And I'm like, well, there's some really bad stuff off record being said.
[00:56:38.025 --> 00:56:42.047]  And then they would openly say it to my lawyers on record later.
[00:56:42.067 --> 00:56:44.669]  Well, if Jones will just shut up about this, we've got a list of things, we'll leave him alone.
[00:56:46.317 --> 00:56:48.099]  And then now they're in the newspaper admitting it.
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:51.223]  I mean, these people are something else.
[00:56:53.285 --> 00:56:57.610]  To help keep us on the air, folks, whatever comes out of this, you need to support our sponsor.

[00:57:38.853 --> 00:57:41.256]  It's like it takes funds for Trump to fight the New World Order.
[00:57:41.276 --> 00:57:41.937]  Hour number two.
[00:57:42.498 --> 00:57:43.499]  So much more coming up.

[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:58.544]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:18.877]  There are many claims that Russia has fared better than most big countries during this deadly era of fake pandemics and experimental mandated shots.
[01:00:19.497 --> 01:00:23.078]  And so I traveled to Russia last December to see for myself.
[01:00:23.758 --> 01:00:28.240]  What I learned was that this is true, but the government is not to credit for this.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:40.434]  While elements of the Russian Federation do protect and preserve the Russian people and their culture, the evidence shows that they were administering the same deadly shots as we've seen in the West.
[01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:50.902]  The number of deaths in Russia during the rollout of their vaccines exceeded 2.4 million people, making it the worst year of deaths since 1945.
[01:00:52.222 --> 01:01:07.330]  Data shows a correlation between vaccination and the increase in morbidity and mortality, and the head of the Russian Ministry of Health urged pregnant women to get the shot, saying it will contribute to a more comfortable and safe pregnancy.
[01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:10.759]  It's not the government that is saving the Russian people.
[01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:12.585]  It is the people themselves.
[01:01:13.769 --> 01:01:19.293]  What I noticed the most about the Russian people is that they are far more united than the American people.
[01:01:19.714 --> 01:01:28.060]  And everyone I've talked to here has told me that during the mask mandates and vaccine push, the majority of people unitedly ignored them.
[01:01:28.701 --> 01:01:33.104]  The police wore their masks below the chin and didn't enforce them on the people.
[01:01:33.564 --> 01:01:38.048]  And employers were forging documents to show vaccination when there was none.
[01:01:38.889 --> 01:01:41.351]  They were not fooled and they had each other's back.
[01:01:42.222 --> 01:01:51.029]  Many have told me that this unity is a result of generations of hardship that has embedded the importance of community into every Russian psyche.
[01:01:51.810 --> 01:01:53.591]  And I am sure that this is a big part of it.
[01:01:53.952 --> 01:01:58.876]  But there is another big factor that has contributed to their unity, which can be adopted by anyone.
[01:01:59.396 --> 01:01:59.936]  Repentance.
[01:02:00.837 --> 01:02:04.659]  Orthodox Christianity used to be the official religion of Russia.
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:12.124]  It was made illegal during the Soviet Union, and when communism fell, orthodoxy re-emerged in a massive way.
[01:02:12.724 --> 01:02:25.933]  Within the first few years, over 20 million Russians were baptized, and many of these people believed that the nation must repent for allowing the Romanov family to be brutally executed by Bolsheviks during the revolution.
[01:02:26.813 --> 01:02:32.037]  Millions of Russians believe that repentance is the only thing that will save Russia.
[01:02:33.158 --> 01:02:37.382]  I've heard many American Christians say that America must repent as well.
[01:02:37.842 --> 01:02:41.946]  But before I came to Russia, I did not understand what repentance was.
[01:02:43.277 --> 01:02:48.984]  According to Saint John Chrysostom, the purpose of repentance is for healing and transformation.
[01:02:49.464 --> 01:02:57.934]  There are five paths, and they are so simple that they can be practiced by anyone without submission or conformity to any dogma or belief.
[01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:03.920]  The first path of repentance is contrition, or the condemnation of your own sins.
[01:03:04.721 --> 01:03:08.784]  In order to improve at anything, you must be aware of your weaknesses.
[01:03:09.305 --> 01:03:15.591]  If you want to become a better carpenter, then you need to be aware of what makes you a poor one, so that you can change those things.
[01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:21.776]  The same goes for everything, and if you want to become a good person, you have to be aware of your own shortcomings.
[01:03:22.881 --> 01:03:25.602]  The second path of repentance is forgiveness.
[01:03:26.162 --> 01:03:28.844]  It is the overlooking of another person's sins.
[01:03:29.624 --> 01:03:33.706]  This is not saying that laws and justice should not be upheld.
[01:03:34.186 --> 01:03:41.589]  It is saying that when you are focused on other people's shortcomings, you are wasting time that should be focused on your own.
[01:03:42.189 --> 01:03:49.673]  We have no right or power to compel others, but we do have the power and the responsibility to change ourselves.
[01:03:50.748 --> 01:03:52.968]  The third path of repentance is prayer.
[01:03:53.449 --> 01:03:58.209]  Specifically, prayer that is impassioned, focused, and comes from the heart.
[01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:07.211]  Taking the time to turn our thoughts away from worry, desire, and the mundane, and cultivate the frequency of love and gratitude.
[01:04:07.771 --> 01:04:16.033]  The power of prayer has been scientifically measured, and consistent group prayer has lowered crime in the areas it was practiced in.
[01:04:17.199 --> 01:04:21.203]  The fourth path of repentance is kind deeds towards others.
[01:04:21.723 --> 01:04:27.108]  The world is full of opportunities to show compassion and generosity to others in need.
[01:04:28.049 --> 01:04:35.135]  And the fifth path of repentance is humility, becoming more humble in our thoughts, words, and actions.
[01:04:35.876 --> 01:04:41.759]  According to these teachings, one must simply choose at least one of these paths each and every day.
[01:04:42.399 --> 01:04:47.202]  This is about taking responsibility, which is the root of every healthy society.
[01:04:47.742 --> 01:04:49.263]  And the outcome is quite clear.
[01:04:49.723 --> 01:04:55.766]  The more people practicing these five simple paths, the more their society will heal and transform.
[01:04:56.647 --> 01:04:59.088]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.

[01:06:26.555 --> 01:06:28.335]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show second hour.
[01:06:28.355 --> 01:06:29.675]  He'll be with us for 30 minutes.
[01:06:29.715 --> 01:06:31.236]  I'll invite him back for a full hour soon.
[01:06:32.036 --> 01:06:34.856]  They shut us down the next few weeks, whatever new broadcast I'm doing.
[01:06:35.316 --> 01:06:37.137]  There's obviously a lot of places to do it.
[01:06:37.157 --> 01:06:37.797]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:06:38.737 --> 01:06:41.958]  But he is a former Marine Corps naval aviator.
[01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:42.638]  I just said Air Force.
[01:06:42.698 --> 01:06:43.938]  I've got so much going on in my brain.
[01:06:44.318 --> 01:06:45.458]  Colonel Gannon Burton.
[01:06:45.859 --> 01:06:50.519]  I won't go over his whole background, but he has a long, a very successful career.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.100]  He was also there at January 6th.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:59.183]  About an hour before I got to the Capitol from the Ellipse and saw the Feds tearing down the barriers and all the coordination.
[01:06:59.223 --> 01:07:00.484]  He's a military guy, an officer.
[01:07:00.504 --> 01:07:04.246]  He can see the able-bodied people, the coordination that's now all come out.
[01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:05.827]  Just incredible information.
[01:07:05.847 --> 01:07:11.670]  So I'd like him to talk about himself a little bit, his life, his awakening, what he saw on January 6th.
[01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:13.431]  And then he's just really a smart guy.
[01:07:13.451 --> 01:07:20.936]  I wanted to put a face to the voice here with a video link with our syndicated broadcast to millions to then talk about
[01:07:21.676 --> 01:07:33.726]  Ukraine and Russia, China, Israel, Hamas, solutions, faith, grace, courage, don't overthink things, finding fissures and praying them open, and how critical is Trump.
[01:07:34.027 --> 01:07:36.989]  So I'm going to try to give him the floor for the next 26 minutes.
[01:07:37.009 --> 01:07:39.051]  We've got to break and invite him back again soon.
[01:07:39.531 --> 01:07:47.818]  But I love these amazing people that come in as speakers on Spaces, and he's been one of the most informative, so I wanted to make good on that and get him to pop in with us.
[01:07:47.878 --> 01:07:49.800]  So thank you so much, Colonel, for joining us.
[01:07:51.394 --> 01:07:53.195]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you so much.
[01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:54.877]  I'm humbled to be here with you.
[01:07:55.497 --> 01:08:11.409]  Part of the awakening, you know, as you're kind of going through the journey of life and you think you're waking up to things, it really wasn't until last summer when I was firefighting, aerial firefighting, that I had time sitting there waiting on a fire to actually sit and listen to your shows kind of daily.
[01:08:11.429 --> 01:08:12.490]  You know, and I listen to Steve Bannon.
[01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:16.373]  I've been listening to him for a long time, and as I was able to
[01:08:17.076 --> 01:08:17.917]  Please do.
[01:08:35.894 --> 01:08:43.880]  Yeah, so I was born here in Mississippi, actually born in Red Bay, Alabama, but our trailer was in Ittawamba County, just over the border up in the northeast corner.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:52.327]  I went to Belmont High School, got to play three sports, not because I was a great athlete, but there's a lot of folks out there, only 29 folks in my graduating class, so we got to
[01:08:53.317 --> 01:08:57.678]  We got to, uh, you know, basically play the sports you needed to grow up and develop.
[01:08:58.059 --> 01:09:06.041]  And then I went into, uh, you know, I got a prestigious scholarship to Northeast Mississippi Junior College where, uh, you know, they asked me what I want to do.
[01:09:06.081 --> 01:09:08.282]  And they said, uh, I'd like to be an electrical engineer.
[01:09:08.762 --> 01:09:10.243]  That makes the most money in four years, right?
[01:09:10.263 --> 01:09:10.703]  They said, yep.
[01:09:10.723 --> 01:09:16.465]  And they said, that'll be hard, but it turns out we had great teachers and preachers and everything here we needed, you know, in Mississippi.
[01:09:16.985 --> 01:09:20.406]  And then off, uh, a buddy of mine, you know, uh, his,
[01:09:20.922 --> 01:09:23.884]  His father had actually baptized me to join the Marine Corps.
[01:09:23.904 --> 01:09:26.606]  And when he joined the Marine Corps, I was like, man, they're going to eat you up.
[01:09:26.706 --> 01:09:28.147]  My parents had gotten divorced when I was young.
[01:09:28.187 --> 01:09:30.969]  I'd been out in California for a few years and bounced back and forth.
[01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:33.050]  But, uh, I said, you know what?
[01:09:33.071 --> 01:09:33.851]  I'll join with you.
[01:09:34.071 --> 01:09:49.482]  And it turns out that if you'd grown up, uh, you know, getting lost in the woods in the middle of the night here in Mississippi, uh, playing, you know, doing two-a-day sports, uh, shooting, learning how to shoot deer that were on the run, being chased by dogs, that you were pretty well set up to be a, uh, you know, a good Marine.
[01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:50.840]  I think so.
[01:10:07.472 --> 01:10:08.073]  I want to fly.
[01:10:08.173 --> 01:10:09.474]  And they said, all right, you got to take a test.
[01:10:10.075 --> 01:10:13.599]  And I was at, you know, on my way to Mississippi State to finish up my engineering degree.
[01:10:13.619 --> 01:10:16.962]  And I aced the test and was able to, you know, get an aviation contract.
[01:10:17.022 --> 01:10:21.106]  And then, and like I said, I got into the, I married my wife in college.
[01:10:21.787 --> 01:10:22.708]  We're still married today.
[01:10:22.768 --> 01:10:25.211]  Two beautiful kids, two beautiful grandkids.
[01:10:25.251 --> 01:10:26.953]  And I should add you're running for Senate.
[01:10:26.993 --> 01:10:27.974]  That's the most important thing.
[01:10:29.062 --> 01:10:32.525]  Well, I ran for Senate, so we got about 60,000 votes.
[01:10:32.546 --> 01:10:41.434]  We won nine counties up here in Northeast Mississippi, which kind of goes in the story, too, which is building your bubble, being engaged, letting people see that you're out there, you know, because that's the resiliency you're going to need.
[01:10:41.474 --> 01:10:42.075]  You can't do this.
[01:10:42.095 --> 01:10:46.399]  You're not going to be able to save yourself from the zombie apocalypse or World War III or whatever's coming down the pipe.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:49.723]  It's going to be, you know, being involved in your community and everything else.
[01:10:49.763 --> 01:10:52.886]  So I did do that, frankly, because I just
[01:10:53.346 --> 01:10:56.967]  You know, no one else was stepping up and telling the truth, as you do every day.
[01:10:57.027 --> 01:10:58.748]  And regardless, you were able to educate people.
[01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:07.751]  So shifting gears out of all that experience, all that life, what you saw on January 6th, and hit these points, because you've said a lot of great things on spaces on different shows I've been on.
[01:11:07.771 --> 01:11:09.011]  I wanted to hear your knowledge on that.
[01:11:10.292 --> 01:11:19.215]  Yeah, so, you know, as we got in, you know, we, we were in Korea in, at the beginning of 2020, I was the Deputy Commander of Marine Forces Korea.
[01:11:19.295 --> 01:11:20.375]  And I was over there when the first
[01:11:21.408 --> 01:11:34.723]  Uh, when the COVID was really hitting and so the things that you were saying back in the United States we were experiencing about six weeks prior to that and all those protocols that started rolling out they were rolling them out there on Camp Humphreys.
[01:11:35.023 --> 01:11:36.185]  The social distancing
[01:11:36.736 --> 01:11:40.538]  And the mask wearing, that all came out of Camp Humphreys, Korea.
[01:11:40.618 --> 01:11:46.820]  General Abrams at the time was talking back to Deborah Birx, and they were having conversations about wearing masks and everything.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:52.923]  And we had a virologist on staff, and after we'd been wearing masks for a while, I go, does these things work?
[01:11:53.103 --> 01:11:54.443]  And he says, no, they don't work.
[01:11:54.603 --> 01:11:56.444]  And I said, well, have you told the general?
[01:11:56.664 --> 01:11:57.204]  You work for him.
[01:11:57.244 --> 01:11:58.205]  He says, I have told him.
[01:11:58.545 --> 01:11:59.305]  But you know what he said?
[01:11:59.725 --> 01:12:01.106]  He said he liked the visual.
[01:12:01.186 --> 01:12:05.528]  He liked that people were coming together to show that they were fighting this virus, which
[01:12:06.068 --> 01:12:18.231]  We knew at the very beginning of this thing, and it was the most frustrating thing ever for those of us who are critical thinkers, because I was talking to the doctors, we knew the exact attack rate of the COVID virus because it hit the Theodore Roosevelt, right?
[01:12:18.811 --> 01:12:26.593]  One person out of 6,000 died who had pre-existing conditions and things that would make you vulnerable to it.
[01:12:27.013 --> 01:12:28.833]  The attack rate was what got them, which was 35%.
[01:12:29.654 --> 01:12:34.335]  Now, that could have been about how the tests and everything they used, but they hadn't seen a virus with an attack rate that high, 35%.
[01:12:35.859 --> 01:12:41.088]  Of the people got infected and of those 35% I think they said around 14 or 15% actually.
[01:12:41.128 --> 01:12:45.997]  So an extreme which was designed to do man-made chimera extreme spreadability.
[01:12:46.977 --> 01:12:50.638]  Yeah, it was highly contagious for whatever test they had set up to get it.
[01:12:50.678 --> 01:12:54.398]  At the end of the day, it wasn't a threat to healthy young people in general.
[01:12:54.418 --> 01:12:56.859]  It certainly wasn't any reason to pull a ship in a port.
[01:12:56.919 --> 01:13:00.019]  It certainly isn't a reason to shut an entire country's economy.
[01:13:00.059 --> 01:13:03.580]  And by the way, that commander was obviously told to say that and bought into it and believed it.
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:07.201]  He was a team player, but they used the people, you know, the road to hell to pay good intentions.
[01:13:07.601 --> 01:13:08.941]  It's like a Nazi armband, though.
[01:13:09.241 --> 01:13:12.002]  Wearing the mask was a symbol of the fear, not solidarity.
[01:13:12.062 --> 01:13:13.582]  The symbol that this is a big threat.
[01:13:15.575 --> 01:13:24.830]  Yeah, and so that's we would went through that and I gotta tell you, mentally it was it was crushing me because I'm, I knew from the inside that these things weren't working.
[01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:30.659]  And of course, then we land in DC, we get back to DC, and
[01:13:31.607 --> 01:13:34.709]  The United States of America had went completely dystopian on me.
[01:13:34.769 --> 01:13:47.618]  I mean, from the time I got to the Seattle airport, when we got there and they were harassing me about wearing a mask in the airport because I was having trouble breathing because I'm pulling all the luggage you take when you come back from overseas after two years, right?
[01:13:48.038 --> 01:13:49.840]  Me and my wife.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.701]  And then we get to D.C., and D.C.
[01:13:51.921 --> 01:13:55.323]  is, I don't know if you remember at the time, Alex, but it was completely boarded up.
[01:13:55.363 --> 01:13:56.964]  There were looters and rioters everywhere.
[01:13:56.984 --> 01:13:59.126]  It was the height of the Black Lives Matter, all that stuff.
[01:14:00.114 --> 01:14:07.220]  And, uh, but in the back of my head, you know, there was this one guy, you know, President Trump and he was out there fighting and people ask, you know, what do you mean he was out there fighting?
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:14.126]  And I said, he stood, he's the only president I've seen in my lifetime stand with a Bible in front of a church and say, this will not stand.
[01:14:14.466 --> 01:14:16.808]  And you remember that, uh, right there across from the, uh,
[01:14:17.823 --> 01:14:18.503]  Uh, the White House.
[01:14:18.543 --> 01:14:20.664]  So I was like, okay, we've got to get through this election.
[01:14:20.784 --> 01:14:23.245]  And when we get through this election, there's no way Joe Biden's going to win.
[01:14:23.285 --> 01:14:26.967]  He's filling up, he can't fill up the circles in the, in the little rallies he's having.
[01:14:26.987 --> 01:14:28.287]  It's obviously a fraud.
[01:14:28.748 --> 01:14:37.971]  And then, uh, and then Joe Biden told us right before the election, you know, they've assembled the most, um, diverse, uh, voter fraud organization history.
[01:14:38.352 --> 01:14:44.794]  Uh, and you played that video, uh, several times, but for whatever reason, because of cognitive dissonance, we couldn't believe him.
[01:14:44.914 --> 01:14:45.675]  And they had, right?
[01:14:46.475 --> 01:14:46.535]  Um,
[01:14:47.429 --> 01:14:52.592]  And so when election night came, uh, and we all went to bed, you know, thinking this thing is over.
[01:14:52.632 --> 01:14:55.894]  And at four o'clock in the morning, we woke up and they dropped 168,000 votes.
[01:14:55.935 --> 01:14:57.956]  I think it was in Michigan, all for president Biden.
[01:14:58.356 --> 01:15:03.980]  We saw that, you know, in Pennsylvania, they were bringing- The graph, same thing, goes straight up, which organically Trump's beating Biden.
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:05.841]  Then the states, bloop, right above him.
[01:15:06.653 --> 01:15:07.633]  Yeah, the fraud curve, right?
[01:15:08.194 --> 01:15:16.877]  So that whole thing happens, and I'm looking at this, I'm going, there's no way all these great people, all the representatives, they're Americans, they've got these same values that I was brought up on.
[01:15:17.797 --> 01:15:19.258]  The truth was going to shine through this.
[01:15:19.298 --> 01:15:21.179]  There's no way that this is going to stand.
[01:15:21.219 --> 01:15:23.860]  Bill Barr initially comes out and says, hey, they're going to look into this.
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:31.163]  Well, then we find out that Bill Barr actually told the prosecutor in Pennsylvania to stand down.
[01:15:31.363 --> 01:15:33.984]  And we didn't know that at the time.
[01:15:34.808 --> 01:15:38.853]  Uh, and we get all the way through to about the 14th or so of December.
[01:15:38.913 --> 01:15:40.715]  I'm still thinking there's no way this is going to happen.
[01:15:41.356 --> 01:15:45.702]  And then they certified that election and two things happened.
[01:15:45.722 --> 01:15:46.743]  If you go back.
[01:15:47.372 --> 01:15:59.899]  And look at it, Bill Barr and Gina Haspel, who was the CIA Director at the time, Bill Barr being the Attorney General at the time, they both went right after that election and they talked to Mitch McConnell.
[01:16:00.159 --> 01:16:05.603]  And when they went and talked to Mitch McConnell, and it was reported openly that they had done that, I go, okay, this is a coup.
[01:16:06.063 --> 01:16:09.145]  We're now dealing with a coup and a takedown of the United States.
[01:16:09.645 --> 01:16:13.247]  And so I'm out there, you know, I'm on active duty, I can't be, you know,
[01:16:14.051 --> 01:16:28.795]  Uh, campaigning or anything like that, but I can be pointing out these irregularities and things that are bothering me as a, as a guy that's, you know, responsible, you know, took an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that what's going on is not right in this country and it'll destroy it.
[01:16:28.935 --> 01:16:30.535]  You know, it'll, it'll break the fabric of it.
[01:16:31.195 --> 01:16:33.716]  So I'm, I am visible kind of saying those things.
[01:16:34.336 --> 01:16:41.458]  Um, and then when we get to the, uh, we get to the 14th, all of a sudden people start engaging and saying, Hey, here's a plan.
[01:16:42.339 --> 01:16:43.279]  That is out there.
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:54.704]  And I got that, you know, through just a happenstance of going to, you probably are familiar with the Wing and Dub just off of Capitol Hill, going there, sitting down with my family and listening to a Stafford talk.
[01:16:54.724 --> 01:16:57.926]  He was a staffer for John Kennedy of Louisiana.
[01:16:59.494 --> 01:17:02.296]  He said that they're going to present, they've got a plan, they're going to present it.
[01:17:02.356 --> 01:17:07.979]  And that calmed me down for a while, you know, because I'm like, OK, they're they're going to put this fraud out there.
[01:17:08.039 --> 01:17:09.120]  This is what's going to happen.
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:12.042]  So it'll get exposed and then it won't stand.
[01:17:12.142 --> 01:17:16.785]  And then the rightful outcome of this election will, you know, will eventually be certified.
[01:17:18.407 --> 01:17:22.190]  And so, like I said, I was working at the Pentagon at the time as a deputy.
[01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:31.317]  I was responsible for the TAC Air portfolio for the Marine Corps, which is all your fighters and your C-130s in the Marine Corps.
[01:17:31.337 --> 01:17:37.542]  I was responsible for, you know, basically the programmatics of how all that works and all the action officers making sure that the resources were where they're supposed to be.
[01:17:38.614 --> 01:17:44.659]  But I took leave on January 6th because I knew a bunch of people were coming in and frankly I wanted to go listen to what the President had to say.
[01:17:45.039 --> 01:17:46.000]  So I took leave that day.
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:50.463]  My wife and I, we walked down past the Capitol to the Ellipse.
[01:17:50.503 --> 01:17:55.506]  We lived just a couple blocks away from the Capitol, from the Capitol building.
[01:17:56.067 --> 01:17:59.789]  So we had to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue and we listened to the President speak, you know.
[01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:07.154]  We saw, you know, the guy with the horns and all that out there.
[01:18:08.732 --> 01:18:11.374]  And we listened to the president speak and he was just laid out the voter fraud.
[01:18:11.414 --> 01:18:14.817]  Just kind of, you probably remember, he just laid it out very succinctly.
[01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:16.899]  He wasn't jeering or anything.
[01:18:16.919 --> 01:18:20.382]  He said, you know, let your voices be heard peacefully and patriotically.
[01:18:20.662 --> 01:18:21.983]  And I knew I couldn't participate at all.
[01:18:22.003 --> 01:18:27.528]  So I just kind of stood on the peripheries and kind of walked back towards our home, you know, up along Pennsylvania Avenue.
[01:18:28.174 --> 01:18:35.357]  And while we're doing that, you had the Antifa folks who were out there, and they were saying, this is our Reichstag moment.
[01:18:35.457 --> 01:18:36.878]  This is our Reichstag moment.
[01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:38.178]  And that was something to see.
[01:18:38.698 --> 01:18:41.740]  And then that other kid, you remember Jalen?
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:43.540]  I'm trying to think of his last name.
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:44.661]  J-X, connected to the CIA.
[01:18:45.666 --> 01:18:46.467]  That's exactly right.
[01:18:46.487 --> 01:18:58.418]  So, Carol and I get back, as we're walking past the entrance to the Senate building, you know, that's when we started seeing all these well-put-together people just moving barriers around, right?
[01:18:58.638 --> 01:19:08.768]  And again, you're a colonel in the Marine Corps, you were the deputy head in Korea, you know when you see military men, or feds, you can see people that got their stuff squared away.
[01:19:09.656 --> 01:19:10.876]  Government people, this is what they look like.
[01:19:13.077 --> 01:19:14.478]  With a little bit shorter haircuts, right?
[01:19:15.518 --> 01:19:15.958]  And younger.
[01:19:16.278 --> 01:19:19.379]  And they were moving and they were grabbing these bike racks, right?
[01:19:19.459 --> 01:19:23.081]  And then you had these protesters who, looking back on it, were clearly paid.
[01:19:23.101 --> 01:19:24.241]  They were sitting there yelling at the police.
[01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:28.263]  I'm like, you know, MAGA people don't yell at the police and are not calling the police.
[01:19:28.283 --> 01:19:29.063]  Yeah, they were there agitating.
[01:19:29.912 --> 01:19:32.833]  But you could tell they were agitated because the police weren't engaging them.
[01:19:32.853 --> 01:19:33.573]  There was no one there.
[01:19:33.593 --> 01:19:34.813]  It was complete astroturf.
[01:19:34.833 --> 01:19:36.634]  And by the way, Trump was being set up.
[01:19:36.734 --> 01:19:37.714]  We had the space.
[01:19:37.794 --> 01:19:39.195]  We had the thing behind the Capitol.
[01:19:39.595 --> 01:19:40.515]  We had all of it.
[01:19:40.915 --> 01:19:41.475]  They waited.
[01:19:41.495 --> 01:19:45.116]  I don't think the Secret Service was in on it, but they told me to go once it already started.
[01:19:45.577 --> 01:19:46.517]  So you were a little bit ahead of me.
[01:19:47.833 --> 01:19:53.957]  Yeah, so like I said, right after his speech, we walked past there and it was the biggest crowd I've ever seen.
[01:19:54.017 --> 01:19:56.078]  I mean, I know people talk about 100,000, 200,000 people.
[01:19:56.098 --> 01:19:59.080]  That's got to be close to a million people.
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:19:59.940]  At least a million.
[01:20:01.101 --> 01:20:02.042]  In terms of the numbers.
[01:20:02.082 --> 01:20:08.606]  I mean, it was an incredible size of a crowd, but they were mostly, you know, all peaceful there.
[01:20:10.526 --> 01:20:18.108]  Anyway, as we walked past the Capitol and we looked back and we saw them opening those barriers, what they were doing was basically setting up a fish ladder, right?
[01:20:18.148 --> 01:20:27.451]  And so now, we move towards the Supreme Court, and as we're sitting there at the Supreme Court, that's when that Jaden Nex comes running by saying, we're making history, we're making history, we're making history.
[01:20:27.491 --> 01:20:28.552]  That's what he kept saying.
[01:20:28.692 --> 01:20:31.212]  And he got caught on video to his girlfriend when they were breaking the Capitol.
[01:20:31.232 --> 01:20:32.513]  He goes, I told you we were going to do it!
[01:20:32.833 --> 01:20:34.453]  I told you we were going to do it!
[01:20:35.794 --> 01:20:35.994]  Yeah.
[01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:42.673]  So then, now we're sitting back there watching, you know, this and all of a sudden people start streaming in.
[01:20:42.713 --> 01:20:44.974]  And I told my wife, I go, get behind this tree over here.
[01:20:44.994 --> 01:20:51.597]  There's a big oak tree right there just north of the entrance to the Senate building.
[01:20:51.637 --> 01:20:52.418]  I said, get behind this tree.
[01:20:52.458 --> 01:20:56.060]  I said, I got to believe they're going to start shooting because they were rushing it, right?
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.240]  And they weren't really rushing it.
[01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:59.221]  They were actually being funneled in.
[01:21:00.202 --> 01:21:02.563]  And I didn't really understand that at the time because what I saw was just this
[01:21:03.883 --> 01:21:06.644]  Massive people, you know, going in.
[01:21:06.664 --> 01:21:07.825]  I'm like, this is insane.
[01:21:07.885 --> 01:21:09.805]  I cannot believe that this is happening.
[01:21:09.905 --> 01:21:15.928]  And they had some conservative, useful idiots that went, but it was broken down, and the police stood down, let them in.
[01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:33.014]  It was run by the... You know, this is where I have so much grace for those folks, because if you had come from Belmont, Mississippi, and you were there because you thought the election was rigged, which it was, and you thought that your country was being taken over via a coup, which it was, and then you were waved into the Capitol,
[01:21:34.195 --> 01:21:35.156]  You would have walked right in.
[01:21:35.396 --> 01:21:38.218]  You would have had no idea that you weren't supposed to be there.
[01:21:38.398 --> 01:21:49.806]  And that's where my frustration, not just frustration, but just visceral anger with the Department of Justice and Merrick Garland and Joe Biden, those people are, because they're locking up good people.
[01:21:50.246 --> 01:21:54.449]  To make an example of them so that they'll be afraid and they want a country that's living off of fear.
[01:21:54.489 --> 01:21:57.671]  And that makes them, as you said in your previous segment, evil.
[01:21:57.851 --> 01:22:01.253]  I mean, we are dealing with pure evil at this time.
[01:22:01.293 --> 01:22:05.255]  And if we call it anything other than that, we're not armed for what we're up against.
[01:22:05.536 --> 01:22:10.379]  We're going to do something or give quarter when we shouldn't give quarter to an argument just to be nice.
[01:22:10.459 --> 01:22:11.239]  No, I totally agree.
[01:22:11.279 --> 01:22:14.441]  And my big concern is they're getting ready to stage more provocateur actions.
[01:22:14.801 --> 01:22:16.803]  By the time we have left, Colonel, I'm going to get you back.
[01:22:17.663 --> 01:22:24.167]  Let's get into the big picture of this election with 140-something days left and what the deep state's going to pull and how we stop it.
[01:22:25.788 --> 01:22:34.613]  Yeah, so, I mean, you've kind of, I think you've nailed it as good as anyone can right now, which is
[01:22:35.359 --> 01:22:45.689]  They're trying to foment a civil war, and I think that might be why we're getting so much information on the COVID vaccines, because what we knew, we knew from the beginning.
[01:22:45.849 --> 01:22:47.230]  I mean, I knew it once my stepmother died.
[01:22:47.290 --> 01:22:47.471]  Bingo!
[01:22:47.571 --> 01:22:57.440]  It's in the SPARS war game document, and by the third and fourth year, we will learn it was on purpose and a lie, and that's meant to create the angrier world Klaus Schwab talks about.
[01:22:58.521 --> 01:22:58.821]  That's right.
[01:23:00.438 --> 01:23:01.319]  Who can you trust?
[01:23:01.479 --> 01:23:06.304]  What government organization out there is it that actually has any trust or accountability?
[01:23:06.384 --> 01:23:12.390]  So, when the government doesn't have any credibility, your anger starts going where?
[01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:14.212]  Towards individuals or people.
[01:23:14.272 --> 01:23:23.441]  And if they can foment violence, even if they have to create it, they've created so many straw men that they could knock down and blame it on, you know,
[01:23:24.099 --> 01:23:28.121]  I think Anthony Fauci needs to go to a Nuremberg-type trial.
[01:23:28.181 --> 01:23:30.582]  I think he needs to, frankly, hang for what he has done.
[01:23:30.662 --> 01:23:35.744]  However, if someone does that extra-judicially, that can be a precursor, right?
[01:23:35.804 --> 01:23:36.224]  Exactly.
[01:23:36.264 --> 01:23:37.144]  It makes him a victim.
[01:23:37.184 --> 01:23:39.385]  We've got to take the government back and then carry out justice.
[01:23:40.233 --> 01:23:40.553]  That's right.
[01:23:40.633 --> 01:23:48.377]  And it's got to be done openly and transparently in order to rebuild credibility in the systems, because, you know, we need a military-industrial complex.
[01:23:48.437 --> 01:23:50.158]  I mean... No, there's no doubt.
[01:23:50.218 --> 01:23:51.699]  The globalists want to discredit the whole government.
[01:23:51.739 --> 01:23:53.180]  No, it's our government.
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:54.661]  They're trying to bring it all down.
[01:23:54.961 --> 01:23:56.522]  We can definitely cut it back, but exactly.
[01:23:56.542 --> 01:24:00.904]  The globalists... I remember the CFR saying 20 years ago, we'll carry out our operations, discredit the U.S.
[01:24:00.944 --> 01:24:06.447]  government, implode it, then have like five years of civil war, then they'll come back and take it over with a tyranny.
[01:24:07.802 --> 01:24:07.962]  Right.
[01:24:08.082 --> 01:24:11.985]  And so, you know, we're dealing with people who are depopulationists and all these other things.
[01:24:12.406 --> 01:24:20.252]  The great thing here is we do have the fissure in the rock, whether they intended it for it to be open or they just can't stop it anymore.
[01:24:20.332 --> 01:24:23.415]  And that is probably why all of your shows devolve into
[01:24:24.053 --> 01:24:32.396]  A long, drawn-out discussion on the vaccines, because that is the truth that's namically soared, that cuts completely across the political parties.
[01:24:32.816 --> 01:24:38.818]  I know there's a bunch of keyboard warriors out there watching right now, and you can shut down anyone on the left with one statement.
[01:24:39.298 --> 01:24:40.298]  Hey man, I love you.
[01:24:40.638 --> 01:24:42.619]  I just want you to stop taking COVID shots.
[01:24:43.239 --> 01:24:43.419]  Right?
[01:24:44.359 --> 01:24:46.280]  And then, now with
[01:24:46.755 --> 01:24:47.155]  I think so.
[01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:08.572]  He was like hydroxychloroquine.
[01:25:08.612 --> 01:25:14.416]  He was all these other things that he was promoting.
[01:25:14.516 --> 01:25:15.057]  Ivermectin.
[01:25:15.077 --> 01:25:17.418]  He was just green light stuff, fix it, open stuff up.
[01:25:17.739 --> 01:25:18.439]  He got set up.
[01:25:18.499 --> 01:25:20.961]  We know they had the pre-plan, had it ready for a decade.
[01:25:21.181 --> 01:25:23.263]  Obama's plan, had it on the shelf.
[01:25:23.583 --> 01:25:28.127]  But he won't admit he's wrong, so they're gonna try to Achilles heel him with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:25:28.167 --> 01:25:29.408]  I don't think he's a bad person.
[01:25:29.828 --> 01:25:36.493]  He may not know he's being manipulated by his VP and his campaign managers that are Google operatives, but you can see Trump's gonna be under
[01:25:36.493 --> 01:25:39.775]  You're cut by him and Trump should get ahead of this.
[01:25:39.795 --> 01:25:40.615]  So you're exactly right.
[01:25:40.755 --> 01:25:45.698]  And I will make a prediction with you with regard to you talk about what's going to happen on the lead up election.
[01:25:45.878 --> 01:25:47.279]  One is putting Trump in jail.
[01:25:47.299 --> 01:25:50.041]  And I think if they once they put Trump in jail, I do think they will.
[01:25:50.581 --> 01:26:00.066]  That is when they are going to use that opportunity to put all of the vaccine, Operation Warp Speed, all that on him where he's not in a position to defend himself.
[01:26:00.146 --> 01:26:02.808]  So I personally warned him of that.
[01:26:04.005 --> 01:26:08.546]  And I'm not going to say what was, but yes, I told him that two years ago, but go ahead.
[01:26:09.486 --> 01:26:11.647]  I know you have, and I would pray.
[01:26:11.707 --> 01:26:21.348]  And if anyone's watching that knows him, that talked to him is that before that sentencing, before July gets in here, he needs to step out against this vaccine.
[01:26:21.368 --> 01:26:23.649]  The information now is in the public sphere.
[01:26:23.749 --> 01:26:24.569]  It's overwhelming.
[01:26:24.849 --> 01:26:30.190]  You have European countries and mainstream media in Europe now coming together on this.
[01:26:30.250 --> 01:26:33.651]  If you see what's going in on Australia, they're clamping
[01:26:34.181 --> 01:26:35.022]  They're not clamping down.
[01:26:35.062 --> 01:26:39.226]  They're opening up and now starting to expose the damage that has been done there.
[01:26:39.286 --> 01:26:42.549]  So, those fissures that I kind of talk about are there.
[01:26:43.029 --> 01:26:47.634]  We've just got to pour it full of water and freeze the rock so it splits the thing open.
[01:26:47.694 --> 01:26:48.134]  Exactly.
[01:26:48.174 --> 01:26:53.359]  And our military is full of great men and women like you who still want to save the country.
[01:26:53.619 --> 01:26:54.740]  And the public wants to, too.
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:55.781]  And you're dead on.
[01:26:56.142 --> 01:26:58.264]  The good news is if we're aware of this, we can derail it.
[01:26:59.963 --> 01:27:00.123]  Yeah.
[01:27:00.303 --> 01:27:02.103]  Now I had to retire because of the vaccine.
[01:27:02.123 --> 01:27:06.684]  Frankly, sometimes I think I'm a coward because, you know, Dr. Teresa Long stayed in and fought the system.
[01:27:06.804 --> 01:27:11.405]  And I wish, uh, in some ways, I think I should have said, no, I'm not going to do it and fought through that.
[01:27:12.385 --> 01:27:13.326]  Don't second guess yourself.
[01:27:13.346 --> 01:27:14.006]  You're fighting now.
[01:27:15.786 --> 01:27:15.966]  Right.
[01:27:16.186 --> 01:27:25.328]  So, um, what I would tell you, what I'm most concerned about is that the leadership in the military is in a position now where
[01:27:26.261 --> 01:27:29.942]  They're going to fold towards the regime at the very top.
[01:27:30.602 --> 01:27:31.263]  At the very top.
[01:27:31.403 --> 01:27:36.124]  And that, the reason is, is because they're complicit in, and these are harsh words, but they're true.
[01:27:36.264 --> 01:27:37.245]  And you got to speak the truth.
[01:27:37.625 --> 01:27:42.866]  They're complicit in poisoning the entire United States military with an unauthorized vaccine.
[01:27:42.947 --> 01:27:50.469]  You just, I think you had it in your previous segment, where you talked about how they swapped Comiridae vaccine with another vaccine, a patent,
[01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:55.036]  And it turns out now the Ninth Circuit has acknowledged that it's not a vaccine.
[01:27:55.216 --> 01:27:59.824]  At best, it's a therapeutic, which is a bad one if that, because you're going to be more likely to get it.
[01:27:59.844 --> 01:28:00.585]  But the bottom line is...
[01:28:01.368 --> 01:28:06.150]  The top of the military, Lloyd Austin in particular, had this information in the summer of 2021.
[01:28:06.230 --> 01:28:16.175]  The indications and warnings of the damages that were being done to service members during that time when it was optional for service members was all there.
[01:28:16.335 --> 01:28:20.797]  It was all in the database and he had to be briefed and there's no way that he was not.
[01:28:21.098 --> 01:28:30.122]  However, there was so much money from the pharmaceuticals to prop up this illegitimate regime that I think they made the decision to get rid of the test group.
[01:28:30.814 --> 01:28:31.054]  You're right.
[01:28:31.074 --> 01:28:31.895]  It was a minute set up.
[01:28:31.915 --> 01:28:34.736]  I want to shift gears out of that and finish up with you.
[01:28:35.257 --> 01:28:42.561]  With Ukraine, Russia, China, Israel, Hamas, solutions, finding fissures and praying them open, and how critical Trump is.
[01:28:42.581 --> 01:28:45.983]  And I'm going to let you go then because I could be shut on any moment.
[01:28:46.503 --> 01:28:48.024]  Which I know I'm not that important, folks.
[01:28:48.064 --> 01:28:52.747]  I'm another target to take out before they run the full final hot coup against America.
[01:28:53.288 --> 01:28:53.988]  And I mean that 100%.
[01:28:54.208 --> 01:28:55.769]  Okay?
[01:28:56.169 --> 01:28:57.510]  We are all in grave danger.
[01:28:57.530 --> 01:28:57.930]  Stay with us.
[01:28:57.970 --> 01:28:58.671]  Back in a few minutes.
[01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:02.657]  Let's go to Nurse Keith in Oregon.
[01:29:02.677 --> 01:29:03.198]  You're on the air.
[01:29:03.238 --> 01:29:04.139]  Welcome and thanks for holding.
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:14.855]  About an hour ago, you were kind of explaining to people about how the micronutrients and stuff that are available and different foods actually have an effect on... No, let's be clear.
[01:29:14.895 --> 01:29:17.358]  There isn't long-term billion-year evolution.
[01:29:17.859 --> 01:29:25.081]  Not trying to brag, but I'm a board-certified wound care associate, which is not an easy certification to get.
[01:29:25.181 --> 01:29:25.722]  It takes years.
[01:29:25.982 --> 01:29:28.302]  And it encompasses, you know, cardiology, endocrine,
[01:29:46.647 --> 01:29:49.008]  You name it, you've got to be good at all kinds of stuff.
[01:29:49.609 --> 01:29:53.391]  And let's face it, a lot of my doctors, they don't know anything about this stuff.
[01:29:53.431 --> 01:29:56.652]  It's my job as a nurse to figure it out.
[01:29:56.872 --> 01:30:00.894]  The average medical doctor gets two hours of college education on nutrition.
[01:30:01.234 --> 01:30:08.358]  So one of the things that I do is I'm looking for results and by using
[01:30:10.122 --> 01:30:14.523]  Very good nutraceuticals and supplements and things like that.
[01:30:14.643 --> 01:30:16.524]  I can fix a problem.
[01:30:16.684 --> 01:30:17.744]  Just a real quick example.
[01:30:17.784 --> 01:30:24.125]  Let's say you have a really bad wound on your leg and you have diabetes and poor circulation.
[01:30:24.205 --> 01:30:32.667]  Well, I can order you a bottle of Nitric Boost, a bottle of BezoBeat, and
[01:30:33.812 --> 01:30:36.454]  Get your ass up on a treadmill a little bit.
[01:30:36.594 --> 01:30:40.337]  These things work better than any of the medication that we give.
[01:30:41.087 --> 01:30:46.210]  So I've got about 35,000 points because I gave these things away as gifts.
[01:30:46.551 --> 01:30:47.151]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:30:47.171 --> 01:30:47.992]  This is important.
[01:30:48.012 --> 01:30:49.392]  This is important, absolutely.
[01:30:49.873 --> 01:30:52.655]  Just iodine alone, it's essential.
[01:30:52.675 --> 01:30:53.475]  It means you die without it.
[01:30:53.495 --> 01:30:55.036]  They don't tell you most people are deficient.
[01:30:55.356 --> 01:30:57.458]  Two billion people have cognitive disabilities, the UN admits.
[01:30:57.678 --> 01:31:00.840]  That's what these concentrated plants and other compounds do.
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:03.802]  So you're saying you're taking care of people with wounds, one of the biggest
[01:31:04.202 --> 01:31:05.443]  Medical industry's out there.
[01:31:05.483 --> 01:31:06.324]  Super tough job.
[01:31:06.644 --> 01:31:10.106]  You're seeing with nutrition and also they need to not be sedentary, obviously.
[01:31:10.566 --> 01:31:13.488]  You're seeing massive effects, because I've actually read about this.
[01:31:13.508 --> 01:31:22.614]  I'm not an expert like you, but that there's massive problems because the doctors don't even say exercise or get out of the bed or take supplements that are good for your skin.
[01:31:23.175 --> 01:31:23.995]  And it's so simple.
[01:31:24.075 --> 01:31:28.558]  I mean, my wife takes supplements to have good hair and good nails and it really works for her.
[01:31:28.678 --> 01:31:29.779]  I mean, this stuff works.
[01:31:29.859 --> 01:31:30.780]  It's the compounds.
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.561]  Tell people about some of the things you've witnessed.
[01:31:33.061 --> 01:31:39.307]  Alex, I would not have 35,000 Patriot Points if this stuff didn't work.
[01:31:39.407 --> 01:31:42.710]  I'm not into buying BS and I don't push BS.
[01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:48.696]  When I've got a complex wound and I see something that you guys sell that I know
[01:31:49.702 --> 01:31:55.804]  We can sell the stuff Walmart sells, synthetic stuff, and the bottle costs more than what they're selling.
[01:31:55.924 --> 01:31:59.745]  With us, these products, some of these products are costing us $30 a bottle, like DNA Force, okay?
[01:31:59.785 --> 01:32:02.065]  I mean, so there's cost because it is the highest rated.
[01:32:16.869 --> 01:32:24.372]  If you're taking a nitrate, like you were talking about the nitrate boost, boom, that is going to vasodilate.
[01:32:25.032 --> 01:32:29.474]  So when you're vasodilated, yeah, you're going to be pitching a proper 10.
[01:32:29.814 --> 01:32:31.455]  The vasobeat does the exact same thing.
[01:32:31.875 --> 01:32:35.096]  But it also helps if I've got a person who's got really poor perfusion.
[01:32:35.974 --> 01:32:42.136]  And I just want to get their blood flow going so that I can keep this wound from going septic and actually get some granulation going.
[01:32:42.676 --> 01:32:44.657]  Or I could throw all the medications at it.
[01:32:44.957 --> 01:32:46.077]  Not going to do a damn thing.
[01:32:46.417 --> 01:32:53.919]  The doctors see the patient for 10 minutes, write a prescription, say, okay, come back in 45 days, and it's my job to actually go figure it out.
[01:32:54.119 --> 01:32:56.660]  And so I use a lot of the stuff that you guys have.
[01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:58.821]  Thank you so much and God bless you, Nurse Keith.
[01:32:58.841 --> 01:32:59.421]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:32:59.441 --> 01:33:00.341]  Give us your name and number.
[01:33:02.651 --> 01:33:08.594]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:16.978 --> 01:33:23.201]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.758 --> 01:33:34.421]  Well, one of the best things about my job is I get to meet all these amazing people of every race, color, and creed who love freedom.
[01:33:34.461 --> 01:33:36.802]  One of those is Colonel Gannon Burton.
[01:33:36.822 --> 01:33:41.324]  You can find his website at mfaf.us or at
[01:33:42.424 --> 01:33:46.949]  Gannon Burton, G-H-A-N-N-O-N, Burton, for radio listeners, it'll be on screen.
[01:33:47.650 --> 01:33:50.533]  But in closing, I'll have you back in the twilight of Infowars.
[01:33:50.593 --> 01:34:00.363]  I see the total attack on us is emblematic of Bannon going to jail in a few weeks, and Trump being convicted, and just this total assault they've told me in person.
[01:34:02.037 --> 01:34:02.417]  Stop!
[01:34:02.577 --> 01:34:09.221]  Take the carpet of gold, carpet of bombs, and now they're in the news saying Jones would not let us control what he said.
[01:34:09.241 --> 01:34:11.162]  I just look at the evil of the arrogance.
[01:34:11.603 --> 01:34:13.844]  They would tell Reuters the truth?
[01:34:14.504 --> 01:34:15.825]  I couldn't believe they said it to me in person.
[01:34:15.865 --> 01:34:17.246]  They're in the news admitting it.
[01:34:18.767 --> 01:34:21.708]  It's not that I'm a hero because I won't sell out.
[01:34:21.828 --> 01:34:23.629]  I cannot do it.
[01:34:23.649 --> 01:34:27.492]  I can't even think about it because I'm not a piece of shit.
[01:34:28.112 --> 01:34:30.754]  And I'm sorry to use that term there, but that's where we are.
[01:34:30.794 --> 01:34:37.920]  So in closing, a gestalt on the current global situation, what we're going into, how we need God, just some of the points you sent me.
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:42.683]  Give us like five minutes on this, and then we can be shut down literally any day now.
[01:34:42.703 --> 01:34:47.907]  So I'm going to kind of get on record for everybody what's really happening here, because again, I'm a microcosm.
[01:34:47.927 --> 01:34:48.648]  This is not about me.
[01:34:49.088 --> 01:34:50.169]  I'm a canary in the coal mine.
[01:34:51.450 --> 01:34:51.770]  Thank you.
[01:34:51.810 --> 01:34:53.692]  You know, faith, grace, and courage, right?
[01:34:54.667 --> 01:34:57.108]  You know, Steve Bannon always says, courage is the critical path.
[01:34:57.148 --> 01:34:59.569]  He got that from, is the critical piece of that.
[01:35:00.570 --> 01:35:05.532]  Because once you have faith and grace, if you don't have the courage to speak the truth, then what good is your faith and grace, right?
[01:35:05.752 --> 01:35:09.994]  So, that's a... By the way, you get into this, but what is courage?
[01:35:10.495 --> 01:35:14.937]  Because for me, I remember talking to Alan Keyes once and I said, I don't ever, I'm never scared.
[01:35:15.397 --> 01:35:16.998]  I'm scared of failure, scared I'll do my job.
[01:35:17.018 --> 01:35:21.100]  He says, because God is renewing your courage millisecond to millisecond.
[01:35:21.823 --> 01:35:29.347]  Yeah, well, I put it in terms of, like, landing on an aircraft carrier at night, going into five combat deployments, you know, flying into a target when there's missiles coming up.
[01:35:29.407 --> 01:35:30.627]  And that's a type of courage.
[01:35:30.647 --> 01:35:33.329]  But I kind of reflected on that after I got out of the Marine Corps.
[01:35:33.369 --> 01:35:37.451]  And I think a lot of that courage was once I kind of got into that system, I didn't want to fail.
[01:35:37.491 --> 01:35:39.872]  I didn't want to let people down and the other things.
[01:35:39.932 --> 01:35:50.557]  But what I've learned since I got out of the military is the real courage and, you know, I was blessed to be, you know, baptized and take Jesus Christ on as my Lord and Savior.
[01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:59.603]  And I was blessed with, you know, growing up in a small church where the pastor, you know, basically told us, Hey, God's going to judge you on his timeline, not yours.
[01:35:59.883 --> 01:36:00.063]  Right?
[01:36:00.223 --> 01:36:07.826]  So if you accept that, and then you accept that Christ died for your sins and forgives you, if you ask for forgiveness, then you have no reason to fear.
[01:36:08.326 --> 01:36:16.909]  So what I kind of, and I didn't know this while I was serving all those years, I think I was operating on that, but I didn't, I didn't, um, I didn't go through the mental gymnastics.
[01:36:16.929 --> 01:36:18.310]  It was already there organically.
[01:36:19.147 --> 01:36:27.672]  Right, it was organically, but now to put it in words for everyone is like, when you have faith, then you take the grace, and then now it's up to you.
[01:36:28.213 --> 01:36:34.456]  The courage is up to you, because God has already said he's going to judge you on his timeline, and you're an infinite being, right?
[01:36:35.017 --> 01:36:42.921]  And grace, meaning you're forgiven for your sins if you ask for forgiveness, because I sent my only begotten son to die for you.
[01:36:44.622 --> 01:36:45.862]  That's all God can do for you.
[01:36:46.082 --> 01:36:47.323]  Now courage is up to you.
[01:36:47.743 --> 01:36:50.444]  And that is for you to step off and just do your best each day.
[01:36:50.504 --> 01:36:52.144]  So courage is your own initiative.
[01:36:52.224 --> 01:36:52.825]  It's your will.
[01:36:54.025 --> 01:36:54.365]  It's your will.
[01:36:54.385 --> 01:36:56.746]  It's your willingness to tell and speak the truth, right?
[01:36:56.986 --> 01:37:00.747]  Because that has taken more courage than landing on an aircraft carrier for me.
[01:37:00.807 --> 01:37:03.348]  Like to get up there and speak the truth about what's going on.
[01:37:03.368 --> 01:37:07.169]  I think it was JFK said that moral courage is more rare than physical courage.
[01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:08.680]  Absolutely.
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:10.501]  And that's exactly right.
[01:37:10.901 --> 01:37:11.741]  We'll get behind the boat.
[01:37:11.921 --> 01:37:12.861]  All our friends are watching.
[01:37:13.082 --> 01:37:14.282]  We don't want to let them down.
[01:37:14.522 --> 01:37:15.642]  We're going to land on that thing, right?
[01:37:15.682 --> 01:37:18.203]  We don't look bad in front of them, but not only that, we want to survive.
[01:37:18.243 --> 01:37:20.764]  And once you're in a fight, then it's your buddies and survival and everything else.
[01:37:21.264 --> 01:37:23.625]  So you get yourself into the situation.
[01:37:23.645 --> 01:37:32.387]  But the moral courage to tell the truth and to speak truth to power, I mean, it sounds cliche, you know, going back to the 60s, but it's actually the hardest and toughest.
[01:37:32.487 --> 01:37:34.328]  And we've got a bunch of national leaders
[01:37:34.668 --> 01:37:35.068]  That won't.
[01:37:35.128 --> 01:37:41.532]  The reason I ran for office was because there was no one on the national stage speaking the truth, the entire truth, in the United States Senate.
[01:37:41.572 --> 01:37:44.834]  Now we have great men like Ron Johnson that are up there that I was hoping to reinforce.
[01:37:45.055 --> 01:37:47.636]  You got men like Tommy Tuberville that I was hoping to reinforce.
[01:37:47.976 --> 01:37:51.619]  You know, you've got Mike Lee in Utah, but they're all taking different areas.
[01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:55.741]  And when you can see the whole thing, I know this is the truth is Damocles' sword.
[01:37:56.642 --> 01:37:57.282]  So that is something.
[01:37:57.302 --> 01:37:58.223]  Thank you for letting me say that.
[01:37:58.243 --> 01:38:01.865]  But I do want to talk about Russia and Ukraine and a little bit of that too.
[01:38:02.267 --> 01:38:04.749]  Yeah, hit your other points here, we'll get you back as long as we're here.
[01:38:17.617 --> 01:38:27.603]  You know, World Economic Forum, National Security Establishment, we currently have here in the United States, the Atlantic Council, all of them, is we have to pressure them with this one idea about China and Russia and Ukraine.
[01:38:27.984 --> 01:38:34.608]  And that is Russia was founded, I studied Ukraine and Russia for a year at the Air War College, a top-level school in Montgomery, Alabama.
[01:38:35.108 --> 01:38:39.210]  And Russia was founded for one particular reason by the Western powers.
[01:38:39.471 --> 01:38:44.394]  And that was to stop the Mongol hordes from coming in every five to ten years and wiping everybody out.
[01:38:44.874 --> 01:38:45.014]  Right?
[01:38:45.618 --> 01:38:52.203]  And now we've got Russia, which is only 130 million people, got about 11.5% of the world's landmass.
[01:38:52.223 --> 01:38:55.306]  They were literally set up to stop the Mongols and the Muslims later.
[01:38:55.406 --> 01:38:58.188]  They were literally warriors set up for this.
[01:38:58.328 --> 01:38:59.409]  That's exactly right.
[01:38:59.589 --> 01:39:02.751]  And they were founded in Kiev of all places, right?
[01:39:02.791 --> 01:39:12.379]  So that's where the prince that they chose, the baddest one of all the princes that were there when the Western powers came in, they consolidated around him to make themselves a buffer.
[01:39:12.459 --> 01:39:13.680]  And that still stands.
[01:39:14.093 --> 01:39:17.894]  Today, and Russia has the large nuclear stockpile it does.
[01:39:18.014 --> 01:39:18.774]  Why does it have that?
[01:39:18.834 --> 01:39:27.957]  Well, because if it loses that, if they lose the moral authority to use those nuclear weapons to defend their territory, China will come north in 37.8 seconds in my estimation.
[01:39:28.857 --> 01:39:32.198]  If Russia fails, if Russia becomes a failed state,
[01:39:32.518 --> 01:39:41.729]  China will move north, and then China will have, and the CCP, not against the Chinese people, but the Chinese Communist Party, will have the resources they need to dominate for the next hundred years.
[01:39:41.749 --> 01:39:49.379]  And you're going to give the total repeat mainline war doctrine of the Sino-Communist-Chinese-Russian split?
[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:50.941]  Absolutely.
[01:39:51.872 --> 01:40:06.241]  This is very basic stuff, and what we've done is we've come in, you know, against the advice of the people who were living in the 80s who won the Cold War, which was, don't go in and pressure or destabilize Russia.
[01:40:06.361 --> 01:40:08.142]  Don't expand NATO.
[01:40:08.462 --> 01:40:14.926]  But the globalists can't handle that because they see NATO as a military force and a tool to achieve what they want.
[01:40:14.946 --> 01:40:17.007]  And before, China was controlled by the globalists.
[01:40:17.067 --> 01:40:19.849]  Now, 10 years ago, it double-crossed them, but they're still following.
[01:40:19.889 --> 01:40:20.409]  This is crazy.
[01:40:22.867 --> 01:40:29.052]  Right, so China is happy to let NATO expand and do everything it can to destabilize Russia.
[01:40:29.273 --> 01:40:40.182]  Now, they're going to sit there and trade with them and pretend to be friends and everything else, but at the end of the day, the CCP would like nothing more than for NATO to succeed in destabilizing Russia and for Russia to become a failed state.
[01:40:40.242 --> 01:40:42.504]  And when that happens, China then dominates the world.
[01:40:42.524 --> 01:40:46.307]  They've got land on their side, they've got the amount of land they'll have on their side.
[01:40:47.328 --> 01:40:51.369]  It's about the size of the United States, but it's got, you know, 1.3 billion people and falling.
[01:40:52.130 --> 01:40:56.851]  But it's only about the size of the United States, and what it lacks is the resources to dominate the world.
[01:40:56.951 --> 01:41:05.574]  And it lacks the intellectual resources to dominate the world because it's a corrupt regime, as all corrupt regimes are coming, just like we're becoming a corrupt regime and our IQ is going down.
[01:41:05.594 --> 01:41:11.716]  And if we look at a 20-year-old plan to hand Russia over to China by pressuring them, even though China's now double-crossed the West,
[01:41:13.083 --> 01:41:19.467]  The old Brzezinski plan is still going ahead to drive Russia into collapse to bring in the Chinese, even though China has turned against the West.
[01:41:20.828 --> 01:41:21.228]  Exactly.
[01:41:21.268 --> 01:41:30.734]  And at the end of the day, those people were coming up with plans that were outside of their longevity, you know, and they could have a utopian view because they were never going to have to live in it.
[01:41:30.774 --> 01:41:31.794]  But we are living in it.
[01:41:31.814 --> 01:41:36.097]  What we're seeing here in the United States is destabilization around the world.
[01:41:36.537 --> 01:41:39.842]  We're getting closer and closer to the brink of nuclear war.
[01:41:40.062 --> 01:41:48.252]  The life expectancy of the United States has went down, the IQs in America is going down, and the health of our children has never been worse because we've been so deeply betrayed from within.
[01:41:48.753 --> 01:41:52.798]  And, you know, God bless you, Alex Jones, for having the courage to tell the truth.
[01:41:52.858 --> 01:41:53.059]  It's just
[01:41:53.799 --> 01:41:55.620]  We have to put it together in some simple vectors.
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:00.662]  It's like when we talk to people in the national security apparatus, like, we need Russia more than Russia needs us.
[01:42:00.802 --> 01:42:05.164]  The Western world needs Russia for the same reason it did back in the 1500s.
[01:42:05.244 --> 01:42:14.387]  The world is still a globe circling the sun, traveling around the earth with so many resources on it, and Russia has immense resources that China wants.
[01:42:14.507 --> 01:42:15.047]  Absolutely.
[01:42:15.067 --> 01:42:16.768]  So in closing, how critical is Trump?
[01:42:19.572 --> 01:42:23.935]  So I think he is the only one who can bring this whole thing together.
[01:42:23.975 --> 01:42:29.199]  He's the only one that actually has shown the guts to tell the truth about everything except for the vaccine.
[01:42:31.021 --> 01:42:33.162]  If we can get him there, we'll win this thing.
[01:42:33.683 --> 01:42:35.004]  His strength is his weakness.
[01:42:35.264 --> 01:42:37.606]  Everybody's wrong, so they can't control him.
[01:42:37.946 --> 01:42:39.647]  But then when we try to, it doesn't work either.
[01:42:39.707 --> 01:42:40.428]  So it's a paradox.
[01:42:41.110 --> 01:42:49.497]  Here's where Trump is going to be critical if we can get back into power, which I believe we will, if he has this in his head, which is the greatness of America.
[01:42:50.118 --> 01:42:52.860]  You've got all these eugenicists, all these people in government that are out there.
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:59.465]  He can set some really hard goals for them that would be very difficult to disalign with for the year 2100.
[01:42:59.525 --> 01:43:03.289]  That would be like a population that lives to at least 85 years.
[01:43:03.569 --> 01:43:07.112]  IQs that are 20 points above what they are right now.
[01:43:07.612 --> 01:43:12.595]  You know, in a population that's 400 million people, there's plenty of land in this country.
[01:43:12.615 --> 01:43:14.436]  You've flown over it, I've flown over it, there's plenty of land.
[01:43:14.456 --> 01:43:18.758]  400 million people, where 95% are second generation or better.
[01:43:18.818 --> 01:43:22.880]  If we set goals like that and we march towards them, then we've actually got something
[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:26.481]  No, I totally agree, Colonel, Marine Corps, Aviation Colonel.
[01:43:26.561 --> 01:43:29.982]  So let me ask you this, former deputy head of the operations in South Korea, really great points.
[01:43:46.906 --> 01:43:54.652]  With Trump 20 points ahead in general polls, 13 points ahead in battleground states, everything backfiring on the deep state, what do you expect him to pull next?
[01:43:55.052 --> 01:43:56.953]  Because they are failing right now.
[01:43:58.294 --> 01:44:03.898]  So what I see is something on the orbit, something like a generated cyber attack.
[01:44:03.958 --> 01:44:07.261]  They know it's coming, they just open up the doors and let it happen, kind of like they did 9-11.
[01:44:07.301 --> 01:44:10.363]  I think maybe Benjamin Netanyahu did something similar.
[01:44:11.488 --> 01:44:14.989]  Well, when he was threatened, you know, back in October, I think he knew it was coming.
[01:44:15.269 --> 01:44:19.911]  And so, what they're going to do is, I think they're going to open up that infrastructure there so that it can be taken down.
[01:44:19.931 --> 01:44:22.872]  They've already got the people in the United States to activate.
[01:44:22.992 --> 01:44:32.456]  And so, if there is a malignant actor out there within the United States government that is active, they've got the tools they need to basically send, you know, Chinese nationals to all of our relay stations.
[01:44:32.516 --> 01:44:35.537]  Exactly, because everybody's looking for a false flag purely stage.
[01:44:35.977 --> 01:44:38.178]  They got all these hundreds of thousands of Chinese nationals.
[01:44:38.558 --> 01:44:39.138]  You don't need that.
[01:44:39.218 --> 01:44:40.719]  They just step, they just stand out.
[01:44:41.721 --> 01:44:42.001]  That's right.
[01:44:42.021 --> 01:44:58.832]  They just kind of step back and then, you know, one malignant actor in there hits the send button on all the cell phones that have been handed out to all these Chinese nationals and all the illegal immigrants telling them which farm you can go to, which relay station to take out with some orders, and they could do that now.
[01:44:58.972 --> 01:45:00.073]  Do I think that's going to happen?
[01:45:00.573 --> 01:45:00.954]  I don't know.
[01:45:02.014 --> 01:45:02.535]  I really don't.
[01:45:03.415 --> 01:45:07.698]  You know, Mayorkas is as treacherous and traitorous as it comes.
[01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:18.268]  You've got, you know, the FBI director out there who, you know, some days he seems like Barney Fife, and then the other days he seems like he's Dr. Evil.
[01:45:18.768 --> 01:45:23.472]  And I don't know who or where that guy is, but I tell you what, he's responsible for whatever happens.
[01:45:23.512 --> 01:45:29.416]  And I think that's the other thing we need to message to the deep state and to everyone else is, you people who are in charge right now, you're responsible.
[01:45:29.577 --> 01:45:30.257]  You are the ones.
[01:45:30.457 --> 01:45:32.499]  You, you know, Anthony Fauci's feeling it right now.
[01:45:32.979 --> 01:45:34.400]  And I think he's going to feel it a lot more.
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:36.580]  We need the people in the DOJ to feel that.
[01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:40.642]  Lisa Monaco at the DOJ, she's responsible.
[01:45:40.662 --> 01:45:44.403]  Well, that was my next point is they think during this crisis we'll forget they did it.
[01:45:44.463 --> 01:45:45.203]  You're reading my mind.
[01:45:45.583 --> 01:45:48.004]  Colonel, join us again very, very soon.
[01:45:48.804 --> 01:45:50.525]  Gannon Burton, thank you so much.
[01:45:51.085 --> 01:45:52.605]  MFAF.US.
[01:45:52.625 --> 01:45:53.286]  God bless you, sir.
[01:45:53.306 --> 01:45:54.006]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:45:54.946 --> 01:45:55.606]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:45:55.626 --> 01:45:56.507]  Thank you for everything you do.
[01:45:56.767 --> 01:45:57.087]  Thank you.
[01:45:57.107 --> 01:46:00.448]  All right.
[01:46:01.892 --> 01:46:05.073]  The most incredible thing happened in the last 24 hours.
[01:46:06.614 --> 01:46:08.374]  In this whole stack of news I'm going to show you.
[01:46:08.474 --> 01:46:10.975]  I'm not going to claim this like they do and then not show you.
[01:46:11.296 --> 01:46:16.638]  This is former federal prosecutors, current ones, all of them in the news, saying what they did to InfoWars.
[01:46:16.698 --> 01:46:17.998]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:46:18.778 --> 01:46:20.759]  They admit what I told you months ago.
[01:46:21.739 --> 01:46:30.963]  That in mediation hearings, which I agreed I would not talk about, that outside of mediation, they told my lawyers and me, which was not protected,
[01:46:32.455 --> 01:46:37.057]  We'll just leave you alone if you'll stop doing Second Amendment and a big list of other things.
[01:46:38.218 --> 01:46:39.559]  And I said, let's just stop right there.
[01:46:40.319 --> 01:46:44.841]  I'm not going to shut down and not talk about anything.
[01:46:45.222 --> 01:46:46.302]  You can put a gun to my head.
[01:46:46.402 --> 01:46:57.048]  So then I came out in the last couple of weeks and talked about, without naming names, the richest guy in the world at the time, having me go up there to D.C.
[01:46:57.088 --> 01:47:01.250]  and meet with his representatives at a huge law firm in a giant building about selling out.
[01:47:03.257 --> 01:47:04.378]  You say, well, why don't you say the names?
[01:47:04.398 --> 01:47:06.339]  I mean, the point is I agree to go to meetings.
[01:47:06.359 --> 01:47:07.800]  It's not illegal for somebody to sell out.
[01:47:08.381 --> 01:47:09.121]  I have these meetings.
[01:47:09.141 --> 01:47:10.983]  I'm not going to say the names, but you can put two and two together.
[01:47:12.484 --> 01:47:16.787]  Literal all hell within two days of me saying that, like 10 days ago, broke loose.
[01:47:17.267 --> 01:47:23.051]  And then the CRO appointed by the court in the bankruptcy tried to shut the company down outside of law with no court order.
[01:47:23.552 --> 01:47:24.372]  So it wasn't the judge doing it.
[01:47:26.254 --> 01:47:27.134]  That's not about me, folks.
[01:47:27.174 --> 01:47:28.075]  That's desperation.
[01:47:29.997 --> 01:47:30.217]  Now,
[01:47:31.735 --> 01:47:38.016]  Within the last 24 hours, they've come out in Reuters, AP, CNN, all of it, and said, it's true.
[01:47:40.557 --> 01:47:52.979]  We want full control of Jones' company, InfoWars, and we told him that if we got control of what he said and did, we would leave him alone.
[01:47:53.199 --> 01:47:57.900]  Well, I'll still be on air and I'll still make money, but you're going to be, I don't care about the money.
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:58.961]  The money is to do things.
[01:47:59.001 --> 01:48:00.101]  The money is a symbol of energy.
[01:48:02.116 --> 01:48:05.397]  So first they try to shut it down eight, nine days ago, last Friday.
[01:48:06.637 --> 01:48:08.717]  Not the Friday two days ago, but the one last week.
[01:48:09.618 --> 01:48:10.498]  And say it's not happening.
[01:48:10.718 --> 01:48:12.878]  But on the Monday court hearing, I'll show you the headlines.
[01:48:13.798 --> 01:48:14.619]  You pull up yourself.
[01:48:15.539 --> 01:48:15.999]  I'll show you.
[01:48:16.159 --> 01:48:17.039]  It's a show me state here.
[01:48:17.059 --> 01:48:18.819]  I'm from Texas, but I feel like I'm in Missouri.
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:24.141]  They then come in and say, yes, we want to shut down today, last Monday.
[01:48:25.801 --> 01:48:26.361]  Seven days ago.
[01:48:29.292 --> 01:48:31.533]  So I didn't agree to liquidate anything.
[01:48:31.953 --> 01:48:35.954]  The judge said, I'm going to give you your company back or they're going to settle three weeks ago.
[01:48:37.174 --> 01:48:38.215]  They refused to settle.
[01:48:38.475 --> 01:48:42.116]  So now they go and they file a chapter seven to put it in federal court.
[01:48:42.136 --> 01:48:44.156]  I said, well, that's better than state court.
[01:48:44.196 --> 01:48:56.380]  Fine, I'll do your seven because that buys us time and gives more transparency than the political judge who controls this judge, Guerra Gamble, who ran that HBO TV production where she already found me guilty, where she called it a trial.
[01:48:57.130 --> 01:49:05.593]  So that's just me, in checkmate, one more move I'm dead, going, well, I'm already caught, I can see the moves, but I've got two moves I can run and buy time.
[01:49:05.913 --> 01:49:06.593]  That's all this was.
[01:49:09.154 --> 01:49:11.334]  But again, it's not about InfoWars, they're making the move on everybody.
[01:49:12.355 --> 01:49:13.895]  So, overhead shot, please.
[01:49:14.215 --> 01:49:18.196]  This is Reuters, 24 hours ago.
[01:49:18.256 --> 01:49:18.796]  Zoom in, please.
[01:49:19.797 --> 01:49:20.317]  Very closely.
[01:49:21.394 --> 01:49:25.317]  Sandy Hook families, when you hear families, they're just being manipulated in my view.
[01:49:25.877 --> 01:49:34.803]  It's the Democratic Party, the FBI head of Connecticut admitting he created all this, the PR firms, the CIA whistleblower that got on tape.
[01:49:35.784 --> 01:49:38.406]  Sandy Hook families agree to Alex Jones bankruptcy liquidation.
[01:49:39.554 --> 01:49:40.215]  And it goes on.
[01:49:40.975 --> 01:49:44.798]  Families of Sandy Hook Massacre victims claimed victory in Alex Jones.
[01:49:45.179 --> 01:49:45.979]  Nothing about Adam Lanza.
[01:49:45.999 --> 01:49:46.680]  It's like, I did it.
[01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:48.601]  Bankruptcy case on Friday.
[01:49:49.082 --> 01:49:53.545]  Accepting the conspiracy theorist's proposal to sell his assets, including Infowars.
[01:49:54.605 --> 01:49:59.887]  To partly pay legal judgments to them for his lies about the 2020 school shooting.
[01:50:00.728 --> 01:50:01.928]  Jones, who filed in U.S.
[01:50:01.948 --> 01:50:09.571]  bankruptcy court 17 months ago, has given up on trying to reach a bankruptcy deal that will reduce the $1.5 billion that he owes.
[01:50:09.591 --> 01:50:10.572]  The judge already found me guilty.
[01:50:10.592 --> 01:50:11.252]  It's a sham trial.
[01:50:11.452 --> 01:50:11.992]  I don't owe that.
[01:50:13.673 --> 01:50:20.036]  To the relatives of the 20 students and 6 staff members killed in the mass shooting at Sand Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.
[01:50:21.296 --> 01:50:21.916]  Now it continues.
[01:50:22.297 --> 01:50:22.897]  Now here's the key.
[01:50:24.465 --> 01:50:35.631]  Chris Maddy, the former federal prosecutor specialist putting Republicans in jail, and attorney for the San Diego families, said on Friday that Jones' pivot to a Chapter 7 liquidation was a moment of meaningful accountability.
[01:50:36.191 --> 01:50:36.572]  Oh!
[01:50:37.612 --> 01:50:48.198]  But later they said there is no accountability, they'll chase it for the rest of my life, for his repeated lies that a judge said, not a jury, pushing the broadcaster to the brink of justice.
[01:50:48.258 --> 01:50:49.299]  The brink of justice!
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:51.600]  And it goes on.
[01:50:53.803 --> 01:51:01.907]  The family said in Friday court ruling that they would back down from their plan and allow Jones to convert his case to a straightforward liquidation.
[01:51:01.947 --> 01:51:03.528]  They'd already filed the plan to liquidate.
[01:51:04.248 --> 01:51:18.615]  Jones has asked the Seneca family to vote for a bankruptcy settlement that would have paid them $55 million, which I don't even have, but I don't care about the money, so I'll say it on air, but they unanimously rejected the deal and offered their own proposal for selling the assets.
[01:51:18.895 --> 01:51:19.936]  Now here's the proposal.
[01:51:22.270 --> 01:51:27.033]  And this is what's so naked, overhead shot, so people can see this please, just a straight shot of this.
[01:51:28.754 --> 01:51:50.246]  While the liquidation will yield only a fraction of the money he owes the families, in a kangaroo court, they objected to his proposal because it would have kept him in control of both Infowars and his wealth for many years, while also capping the total amount that he would pay towards the defamation case.
[01:51:52.563 --> 01:51:56.327]  And they go on to elaborate.
[01:51:56.667 --> 01:51:59.450]  So they just said Jones in control of his own company.
[01:52:01.272 --> 01:52:02.473]  They just admitted right there.
[01:52:02.773 --> 01:52:05.516]  They want to put a board in here that tells you what to say and do.
[01:52:05.796 --> 01:52:06.157]  Never!
[01:52:07.318 --> 01:52:07.698]  Never!
[01:52:07.999 --> 01:52:09.160]  There's nothing you can do.
[01:52:11.653 --> 01:52:21.237]  The court supervised liquidation will allow the families to benefit from immediate asset sales, keeping their claim on Jones' assets alive in the event he accrues wealth in the future.
[01:52:21.457 --> 01:52:23.238]  That means shut down his speech in the future.
[01:52:24.598 --> 01:52:29.941]  Jones went on to say that he will do whatever he can and work for free no matter what they do.
[01:52:30.381 --> 01:52:31.381]  Absolutely!
[01:52:31.781 --> 01:52:37.404]  I'll sleep on a couch now and I'll be on every show out there and you won't stop me and you're about to see.
[01:52:38.848 --> 01:52:40.209]  But this is an incredible admission.
[01:52:40.569 --> 01:52:43.891]  Now, it just took me six, seven minutes to cover this one Reuters article.
[01:52:44.492 --> 01:52:45.152]  Let's look at the others.
[01:52:45.633 --> 01:52:46.793]  Total horse crap articles.
[01:52:47.334 --> 01:52:50.296]  Alex Jones deserves to lose much more than a billion dollars.
[01:52:51.056 --> 01:52:53.198]  Yeah, I didn't, you know, kill millions in Iraq for no reason.
[01:52:53.658 --> 01:52:55.439]  Alex Jones costs himself everything.
[01:52:55.739 --> 01:52:57.120]  No, I'm gonna gain everything.
[01:52:57.521 --> 01:52:59.962]  Alex Jones liquid assets to pay down Sandy Hook families.
[01:53:00.062 --> 01:53:00.683]  NBC News.
[01:53:02.304 --> 01:53:03.785]  On and on and on.
[01:53:04.205 --> 01:53:06.987]  Alex Jones massacre ruling.
[01:53:07.127 --> 01:53:07.888]  Oh, I killed him, huh?
[01:53:09.190 --> 01:53:11.352]  Alex Jones seeks to liquidate his assets to pay damages.
[01:53:11.392 --> 01:53:11.772]  No, I didn't.
[01:53:12.512 --> 01:53:13.193]  I'm cornered.
[01:53:13.853 --> 01:53:15.134]  I have no other move.
[01:53:16.595 --> 01:53:17.416]  And that's fine.
[01:53:17.476 --> 01:53:19.117]  I've been faithful to this operation.
[01:53:19.777 --> 01:53:20.538]  I've told the truth.
[01:53:21.698 --> 01:53:22.799]  Didn't do anything they said I did.
[01:53:23.139 --> 01:53:25.261]  They had to have show trials where I was already found guilty.
[01:53:25.761 --> 01:53:31.725]  And now they sit back and say, we want control of his operation to run and he works for us and we control what he says.
[01:53:31.765 --> 01:53:34.047]  They were already putting training wheels on this to the CRO.
[01:53:36.098 --> 01:53:40.500]  Alex Jones lashes out after agreeing to sell assets to pay legal debt to San Diego families.
[01:53:40.540 --> 01:53:41.521]  I didn't lash out.
[01:53:42.601 --> 01:53:44.442]  I said that I will never surrender.
[01:53:47.204 --> 01:53:48.725]  The best one is this NPR one.
[01:53:49.225 --> 01:53:51.486]  Alex Jones came for the parents of San Diego victims.
[01:53:51.886 --> 01:53:52.947]  Now they're coming for his ranch.
[01:53:53.167 --> 01:53:55.688]  I bought 127 acres way out in the middle of the country.
[01:53:55.988 --> 01:53:57.009]  I've been there like 10 times.
[01:53:57.029 --> 01:53:58.750]  I never even go there for an emergency backup.
[01:53:58.810 --> 01:53:59.610]  It means nothing to me.
[01:54:00.551 --> 01:54:02.572]  It was already sold before this article ever came out.
[01:54:04.335 --> 01:54:06.315]  And they say, oh, they're coming for me.
[01:54:07.156 --> 01:54:13.417]  But in the article, they say, I've got hundreds of millions of dollars hidden because Judge Gloria Gamble said so.
[01:54:13.757 --> 01:54:15.917]  And if she says so, that makes it true.
[01:54:18.418 --> 01:54:19.818]  Now, this goes back to Monday.
[01:54:21.598 --> 01:54:23.259]  Oh, nobody's shutting you down.
[01:54:23.579 --> 01:54:25.259]  Jones made that up, said the feds.
[01:54:27.419 --> 01:54:30.940]  Judge rejects call to immediately shut down Alex Jones' Infowars and bankruptcy case.
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:36.962]  Sandy Hook relatives asked bankruptcy judge to liquidate Alex Jones' company.
[01:54:37.343 --> 01:54:39.324]  So they got $75 million from Remington.
[01:54:39.944 --> 01:54:42.145]  The woman bought the gun legally, gave it to her son.
[01:54:42.566 --> 01:54:43.566]  Everybody's guilty.
[01:54:43.786 --> 01:54:44.627]  Everybody's bad.
[01:54:44.667 --> 01:54:47.388]  But Adam Lanza, you never hear the shooter's name, do you?
[01:54:48.529 --> 01:54:49.230]  The purported shooter.
[01:54:52.311 --> 01:54:53.752]  So, there you are, folks.
[01:54:55.273 --> 01:54:55.973]  They're desperate.
[01:54:57.194 --> 01:55:01.657]  They're using dead kids as their cudgel, as their club to take over.
[01:55:02.915 --> 01:55:03.355]  And that's it.
[01:55:03.875 --> 01:55:05.055]  So I'm honorable.
[01:55:05.256 --> 01:55:07.796]  I feel good about what I've done over 30 years on air.
[01:55:08.996 --> 01:55:14.277]  I started on AXS TV, instantly got a local radio show, went to number one in a year, got syndicated two years in.
[01:55:15.978 --> 01:55:19.319]  I don't, though, think Alex Jones is going to save the world.
[01:55:19.339 --> 01:55:21.639]  It's going to be all of us together awake to this.
[01:55:21.659 --> 01:55:26.160]  They're going to understand what's happening and take action legally, lawfully, nonviolently to change it.
[01:55:27.657 --> 01:55:28.237]  But it's insane.
[01:55:28.277 --> 01:55:32.000]  I can play you the clips of them saying, we don't want money at the courthouse steps, we want to shut him down.
[01:55:32.701 --> 01:55:35.323]  And at least they're being honest about it at the end.
[01:55:35.363 --> 01:55:42.208]  They said, you're our creature, we run you, you're our slave, and you say whatever we want, or you get nothing.
[01:55:42.248 --> 01:55:43.789]  Well, how about you get nothing?
[01:55:44.758 --> 01:55:51.160]  You think I care about a farm or my house that already sold to put money in this operation two years ago?
[01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:52.840]  It means nothing to me.
[01:55:53.301 --> 01:55:55.681]  My integrity is everything.
[01:55:55.861 --> 01:56:02.383]  And they're so blind spiritually, the lawyers, the Democrats, the CIA, that they think I feel defeated.
[01:56:02.543 --> 01:56:04.304]  I've never been more happy.
[01:56:04.684 --> 01:56:06.205]  I've never been more empowered.
[01:56:06.565 --> 01:56:11.306]  I've never had so many doors opening up that I'm like, my God, I wanted to retire years ago.
[01:56:11.606 --> 01:56:12.426]  I've done my job.
[01:56:12.446 --> 01:56:13.167]  People are awake now.
[01:56:13.207 --> 01:56:13.687]  It's up to them.
[01:56:14.207 --> 01:56:19.588]  But I can't, because I'm being drafted into total resistance and stuff ten times bigger.
[01:56:20.249 --> 01:56:29.851]  So, you will discover that no matter what you do to me, I will never back down, I will never give in, I will never falter or waver to any of this.
[01:56:31.211 --> 01:56:32.231]  Yeah, you hurt my crew.
[01:56:32.532 --> 01:56:33.912]  Okay, this building, I've been in forever.
[01:56:34.372 --> 01:56:35.532]  In a way, it's good to change.
[01:56:35.672 --> 01:56:37.373]  I didn't want to, I was totally faithful.
[01:56:38.193 --> 01:56:42.314]  I feel like a giant weight is lifted off me, and then the phone just blew up.
[01:56:44.244 --> 01:56:46.945]  Just absolutely blew up because I was faithful.
[01:56:47.065 --> 01:56:47.825]  I didn't sell out.
[01:56:47.965 --> 01:56:48.686]  I didn't bow to you.
[01:56:49.066 --> 01:56:49.466]  I won't.
[01:56:49.506 --> 01:56:50.627]  People know I've been tested.
[01:56:50.727 --> 01:56:51.127]  I'm true.
[01:56:51.487 --> 01:56:52.227]  I love America.
[01:56:52.367 --> 01:56:52.967]  I love freedom.
[01:56:53.468 --> 01:56:54.328]  And I'll never back down.
[01:56:55.348 --> 01:56:56.189]  So that's the truth.
[01:56:56.849 --> 01:57:04.012]  The deep state brags publicly that they want Alex Jones silenced and that Alex Jones refuses to sell out.
[01:57:05.319 --> 01:57:06.160]  That's what's crazy.
[01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:12.225]  They're so tied into what they do, they have no idea how ridiculously obvious it is what they've done.
[01:57:12.285 --> 01:57:17.889]  Like, they thought indicting Trump or putting him in jail or, you know, convicting him when people hate him, they love him more!
[01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:28.498]  It's just, you're an old, evil establishment coming to an end that uses dead kids and uses sad events and uses comments out of context to create all this demonization.
[01:57:28.838 --> 01:57:29.739]  It doesn't work.
[01:57:29.799 --> 01:57:32.061]  The majority of people see through it.
[01:57:32.967 --> 01:57:37.612]  So support us and tune in tomorrow and come up and up with Chase Geiser and Sunday Night Live.
[01:57:37.632 --> 01:57:41.116]  Tune into that and share it everywhere because we stood the test of time.
[01:57:41.196 --> 01:57:42.037]  We didn't back down.
[01:57:42.077 --> 01:57:42.797]  We didn't submit.
[01:57:43.198 --> 01:57:45.000]  But we need your support now more than ever.

[01:57:52.199 --> 01:57:57.540]  Everybody knows, unless you've been hiding in a cave somewhere for 20 years, that fish oil does incredible things.
[01:57:58.020 --> 01:57:59.681]  But not all fish oil is created equal.
[01:58:00.201 --> 01:58:08.863]  Most fish oil has been pasteurized, it's been boiled, it's been heated up, and they smash the bones and guts of the fish, and it gets contaminants in it.
[01:58:09.443 --> 01:58:20.686]  We sell the highest grade fish oil there is, and it's pure fish oil, and it's not been pasteurized, and it is so good for your whole body, your cardiovascular system, your brain, energy, everything.

[01:58:51.749 --> 01:58:53.331]  Bill Gates up there with that little chicken neck.
[01:58:53.351 --> 01:58:55.274]  You know how he walks?
[01:58:55.314 --> 01:58:57.157]  Like a demonic elf.
[01:58:57.177 --> 01:58:58.298]  I'm Bill Gates!
[01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:01.483]  Got Angelina Jolie going, ah, children.
[01:59:01.603 --> 01:59:02.845]  I am Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:59:02.965 --> 01:59:03.646]  I'm Piers Morgan.
