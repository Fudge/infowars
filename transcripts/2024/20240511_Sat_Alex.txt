[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:01.470]  Synthetic.
[00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.051]  Syncytin.
[00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:04.491]  Sorry, it's spelled wrong.
[00:00:04.892 --> 00:00:07.293]  Synthesize cells together.
[00:00:07.493 --> 00:00:08.253]  Cyto.
[00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:09.914]  Syncytin.
[00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:12.256]  Synthetic syncytin.
[00:00:12.736 --> 00:00:16.038]  Our body makes syncytin.
[00:00:16.418 --> 00:00:22.041]  It's a protein that... Wait a minute, so they're programming people with a synthetic thing that we already need.
[00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:23.802]  Oh, but so then it does it's so...
[00:00:24.142 --> 00:00:31.784]  And then we attack, we attack, not that we already need, it's critical for all of life, for fertilization.
[00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:39.985]  So they put a synthetic one in, our body looks at it and says, that's not me, and it can't break it down.
[00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:46.947]  We could break down the monkey, the mouse, the cow, the aborted fetal, and it took too much time to kill us.
[00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:47.767]  The latent
[00:00:47.907 --> 00:00:48.508]  Period.
[00:00:48.768 --> 00:00:53.273]  That's what Burke showed on the clip that you could play the clip tomorrow.
[00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:57.358]  See, they know what they're doing and they're legally liable.
[00:00:57.838 --> 00:01:01.943]  It's it's it's not it's it's at it's the only
[00:01:02.824 --> 00:01:11.987]  Family of retroviruses that infects all cells of the human body and all animals.
[00:01:12.127 --> 00:01:16.288]  Cows, mammals, lizards have syncytin.
[00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:20.129]  All people who carry their young mammals.
[00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.673]  So every cell of the body, including the sperm and the egg.
[00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:33.202]  So they had to put that synthetic one in, in order to kill certain populations.
[00:01:34.423 --> 00:01:44.172]  Pastor Rob, when I was frustrated trying to explain it to him, he said, Judy, have you ever seen the bottom of Darwin's thesis?
[00:01:44.873 --> 00:01:50.174]  And I'm like, I don't know, by natural immune selection, I'm thinking, and I'm trying to explain this.
[00:01:50.774 --> 00:01:51.854]  He's doing what you're doing.
[00:01:51.914 --> 00:01:52.734]  He's interrupted me.
[00:01:52.754 --> 00:01:53.675]  You're looking at his phone.
[00:01:54.055 --> 00:02:02.876]  And he said, no, it says or preservation of favored races in the struggle for life.
[00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:06.497]  And I'm like, oh, my God, there is no struggle for life.
[00:02:06.817 --> 00:02:12.218]  This is this is the cult of scientism playing evolution games.
[00:02:12.538 --> 00:02:15.141]  We didn't become monkeys and stand up.
[00:02:15.482 --> 00:02:19.667]  They had to put synthetic in because they couldn't kill us.
[00:02:19.927 --> 00:02:21.990]  They couldn't get to the seed.
[00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.277]  They couldn't get to the fertilized embryo instead of that shot.
[00:02:27.837 --> 00:02:37.862]  And the reason I'm still go back to that last slide, because this matters for when we elect everything you're saying in the most important election.
[00:02:38.502 --> 00:02:43.005]  Okay, my pen is pointing to COVID in the bottom right.
[00:02:43.405 --> 00:02:44.345]  And that picture is 2006. 2006.
[00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:58.124]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:07.289]  InfoWars.
[00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.991]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:03:11.011 --> 00:03:11.372]  Today.
[00:03:27.156 --> 00:03:29.218]  Tad O'Malley has been making claims.
[00:03:29.938 --> 00:03:30.659]  Claims about what?
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.603]  You and everyone you know has a piece of DNA in your genome put there without your knowing it.
[00:03:36.723 --> 00:03:37.464]  Put there by whom?
[00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:39.225]  Well, that's the question of the day.
[00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:41.307]  This is an internet lunatic.
[00:03:41.327 --> 00:03:42.668]  You're not saying you believe him.
[00:03:42.688 --> 00:03:44.129]  Hold on, Agent Einstein.
[00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:45.230]  You're talking to a scientist.
[00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.971]  Forgive me, Assistant Director.
[00:03:47.031 --> 00:03:50.514]  It may sound insensitive, but the suggestion is pure science fiction.
[00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:55.918]  What I'm saying, Agent Einstein, is that the facts as I understand them cannot be discounted out of hand.
[00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:00.794]  No one has the right or the ability to tamper with your DNA.
[00:04:02.616 --> 00:04:03.878]  Unless we gave them that ability.
[00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:13.508]  You say they're tampering with our DNA, that they're able to shut down our immune systems by the addition of something to our DNA.
[00:04:13.728 --> 00:04:15.310]  Yes, but I don't know how exactly.
[00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.691]  Or how it's being triggered.
[00:04:17.252 --> 00:04:18.113]  I don't know that either.
[00:04:19.114 --> 00:04:20.135]  Or why it's happening now.
[00:04:21.972 --> 00:04:23.333]  What can we possibly do?
[00:04:23.353 --> 00:04:24.574]  We need to act quickly.
[00:04:25.035 --> 00:04:26.156]  You were right about that.
[00:04:26.236 --> 00:04:27.717]  Well, I was wrong about the science.
[00:04:28.418 --> 00:04:29.799]  I was wrong about what's causing it.
[00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:30.700]  Dead wrong, in fact.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.784]  But it's clearly a widespread failure of our immune systems.
[00:04:34.804 --> 00:04:36.025]  It's through gene tampering.
[00:04:36.245 --> 00:04:39.668]  A virus within a virus that was put there through the smallpox vaccine.
[00:04:39.728 --> 00:04:41.790]  It's what these men are calling the Spartan virus.
[00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:44.092]  We have to figure this out.
[00:04:45.193 --> 00:04:46.394]  What's wrong with the science?
[00:04:47.695 --> 00:04:47.936]  Okay.
[00:04:49.343 --> 00:04:53.084]  The Spartan virus removes the adenosine deaminase gene from your DNA.
[00:04:53.144 --> 00:04:57.106]  It removes the ADA gene and your immune system will simply vanish.
[00:04:57.486 --> 00:04:58.866]  Yeah, but I'm not getting sick.
[00:04:59.686 --> 00:05:00.827]  It's only a matter of time.
[00:05:01.827 --> 00:05:02.127]  Okay.
[00:05:02.848 --> 00:05:03.608]  So how does it work?
[00:05:04.648 --> 00:05:06.769]  How does the virus remove the ADA gene?
[00:05:07.049 --> 00:05:08.409]  A process called CRISPR-Cas9.
[00:05:08.489 --> 00:05:09.470]  CRISPR-Cas9.
[00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.691]  RNA and a protein cutting genes at exact locations.
[00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:14.271]  Exactly.
[00:05:14.592 --> 00:05:16.252]  But in this instance used as a weapon.
[00:05:17.913 --> 00:05:18.693]  The ultimate weapon.
[00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:22.008]  The ability to depopulate the planet.
[00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:24.570]  To kill everyone but the chosen.
[00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.371]  By tampering with their DNA.
[00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:27.833]  Through gene editing.
[00:05:28.033 --> 00:05:29.754]  Why do such a thing and lie about it?
[00:05:29.774 --> 00:05:30.815]  Our own government.
[00:05:30.915 --> 00:05:33.818]  Your own government lies as a matter of course, as a matter of policy.
[00:05:33.838 --> 00:05:37.381]  The Tuskegee experiments on black men in the 30s, Henrietta Lacks.
[00:05:38.662 --> 00:05:39.643]  What are they trying to do?
[00:05:40.236 --> 00:05:41.117]  That's the missing piece.
[00:05:41.517 --> 00:05:42.757]  But it's not hard to imagine.
[00:05:43.378 --> 00:05:47.240]  A government hiding, hoarding technology for 70 years.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.182]  At the expense of human life and the future of the planet.
[00:05:51.222 --> 00:05:53.784]  Driven not only by corporate greed, but...
[00:05:54.642 --> 00:05:55.562]  A darker objective.
[00:05:56.103 --> 00:05:57.443]  The takeover of America.
[00:05:58.103 --> 00:06:04.286]  And then the world itself, by any means necessary, however violent, or cruel, or efficient.
[00:06:05.246 --> 00:06:14.410]  By severe drought, brought on by weather wars, conducted secretly using aerial contaminants and high-altitude electromagnetic waves, in a state of perpetual war.
[00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:21.174]  To create problem reaction solution scenarios to distract, enrage, and enslave American citizens at home.
[00:06:22.054 --> 00:06:28.858]  With tools like the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act, which abridge the Constitution in the name of national security.
[00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:33.101]  The militarization of police forces in cities across the U.S.
[00:06:33.421 --> 00:06:37.984]  The building of prison camps by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with no stated purpose.
[00:06:38.624 --> 00:06:49.309]  The corporate takeover of food and agriculture, pharmaceuticals and healthcare, even the military and clandestine agendas to fatten, dull, sicken and control a populace already consumed by consumerism.
[00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:51.290]  And I encourage you all to go shopping more.
[00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.712]  A government that taps your phone, collects your data and monitors your whereabouts with impunity.
[00:06:57.433 --> 00:07:00.574]  A government preparing to use that data against you when it strikes.
[00:07:01.574 --> 00:07:02.915]  And the final takeover begins.
[00:07:04.116 --> 00:07:05.096]  The takeover of America.
[00:07:05.697 --> 00:07:11.029]  By a well-oiled and well-armed multinational group of elites that will cull, kill, and subjugate.
[00:07:11.911 --> 00:07:13.194]  Happening as we sit here.
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.041]  It's happening all around us.
[00:07:15.622 --> 00:07:16.943]  The other shoe waiting to drop.
[00:07:17.323 --> 00:07:18.585]  It'll probably start on a Friday.
[00:07:19.185 --> 00:07:24.090]  The banks will announce a security action necessitating their computers to go offline all weekend.
[00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.751]  Digital money will disappear.
[00:07:25.771 --> 00:07:27.313]  They can just steal your money?
[00:07:27.593 --> 00:07:32.197]  Followed by the detonation of strategic electromagnetic pulse bombs to knock out major grids.
[00:07:32.378 --> 00:07:35.541]  What will seem like an attack on America by terrorists or Russia.
[00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:36.882]  An invasion of the U.S.
[00:07:37.442 --> 00:07:38.303]  The Russians tried it in 47.
[00:07:41.893 --> 00:07:45.255]  I'm good.
[00:07:56.383 --> 00:08:01.006]  Dr. Judy Michovitz is our guest on this commercial-free transmission today.
[00:08:01.806 --> 00:08:05.629]  It is Saturday, May 11, 2024.
[00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:08.671]  177 days, 12 hours, 54 minutes, 55 seconds.
[00:08:09.131 --> 00:08:11.152]  The most important election in world history.
[00:08:12.053 --> 00:08:12.413]  All right.
[00:08:13.293 --> 00:08:14.394]  She's only got an hour with us.
[00:08:14.534 --> 00:08:15.535]  We really appreciate her.
[00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:16.755]  We can talk to her for 10 hours.
[00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:20.558]  She is a renowned top scientist.
[00:08:21.533 --> 00:08:32.761]  Worked under Fauci, worked under the federal government, ran major projects, and she's been coming on the show since they basically released the COVID and then rolled out the poison shots.
[00:08:33.742 --> 00:08:38.065]  And she said on this show three and a half, four years ago, you can go back and find those.
[00:08:38.125 --> 00:08:39.106]  They're banned on video.
[00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:41.328]  We should repost those to X now that we're back on there.
[00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:45.331]  And everything she said is now all confirmed.
[00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:46.532]  And we have
[00:08:48.112 --> 00:09:01.776]  ABC News, CNN, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Bill Maher, all backpedaling now, saying we shouldn't have locked down the schools, we shouldn't have tried to make you take the shot, or we never tried to make you take the shot.
[00:09:03.217 --> 00:09:08.338]  And it's the same PR campaign from Australia to Germany to the United States, to Canada to the UK.
[00:09:08.818 --> 00:09:11.139]  So, this is really coming out.
[00:09:11.179 --> 00:09:13.560]  The insurance company actuaries have been out for over two years.
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.981]  They continue to show upwards of 22 million dead.
[00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:22.512]  They admit record heart attacks, myocarditis, blood clots, infertility, turbo cancer.
[00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:43.063]  Dr. Minkovits explained years ago that they were putting in the so-called shot that was secret, now they admit they changed it thousands of times, that's mainstream news, in a giant test on the public, flooding it with upwards of 200 billion pieces of DNA per injection.
[00:09:43.724 --> 00:09:45.825]  That is CBS News last week.
[00:09:46.744 --> 00:09:50.525]  So it does have DNA in it, not just the mRNA.
[00:09:51.065 --> 00:09:58.668]  And she explained that they were polluting everybody to cover up what was coming out that they'd already polluted us with, with the other so-called injections.
[00:09:59.708 --> 00:10:01.549]  So she is a expert.
[00:10:02.369 --> 00:10:12.993]  I'm not going to go over her entire background and all of her different degrees in biochemistry, molecular biology, chemistry, the list goes on and on.
[00:10:14.198 --> 00:10:22.580]  She pioneered in the fields of immunology, chemistry, epigenetics, HIV, AIDS, drug development.
[00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:26.384]  And they were able to isolate exactly what was going on.
[00:10:26.424 --> 00:10:28.164]  Then, of course, the Feds came after her.
[00:10:28.884 --> 00:10:40.528]  And she has co-authored more than 50 peer-reviewed publications and books, holds patents on combination therapy for prostate cancer using botanical compositions, and it goes on from there.
[00:10:41.128 --> 00:10:44.609]  And, of course, she's also in New York Times a number one best-selling author.
[00:10:46.169 --> 00:10:46.709]  We're good to go.
[00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:17.873]  TheRealDrJudy.com is her excellent website, but you cannot have someone out of all the amazing whistleblowers and all the amazing, she was a whistleblower 15, 20 years ago.
[00:11:19.874 --> 00:11:25.596]  None of them, and it's not a competition, none of them have been as on target as her from day one.
[00:11:26.236 --> 00:11:28.457]  And so now that we have so much hindsight on this,
[00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:38.763]  It was crystal clear for her, but now she can explain it to us, hopefully in layman's terms, what we're facing and where she thinks this is all going with the UN treaty.
[00:11:39.404 --> 00:11:44.626]  And now they're hyping up bird flu and saying in the news it's gone to humans, but it hasn't.
[00:11:44.646 --> 00:11:46.207]  And then you read the fine print.
[00:11:46.527 --> 00:11:48.868]  They're clearly trying to roll out a new hysteria, but it's not working.
[00:11:49.528 --> 00:11:53.456]  So, Dr. Judy Mikovits, thank you so much for coming on with us today.
[00:11:54.037 --> 00:11:55.219]  You can start wherever you'd like.
[00:11:55.239 --> 00:11:56.581]  I know you sent us a short video clip.
[00:11:56.601 --> 00:11:59.587]  You also sent us some slides that we're going to be going over.
[00:11:59.647 --> 00:12:02.031]  So, thank you so much for spending part of your Saturday with us.
[00:12:03.376 --> 00:12:07.118]  Well, thank you for having me because it's so important to show you.
[00:12:07.138 --> 00:12:19.966]  It's not just me and my entire journey these last 45 years is laid out in our three books, Plague, Plague of Corruption and Ending Plague.
[00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:24.729]  And what you see there is what I call the heroes of the faith.
[00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.371]  Mickey Willis' tour.
[00:12:27.411 --> 00:12:43.587]  The heroes of the faith who stepped in and showed me what I needed to see in that long 15 years since 2009 when our science paper was published that absolutely proved
[00:12:44.708 --> 00:13:00.356]  All of it, all of the shots had mouse, monkey, and manufactured aborted fetal cell, mRNA, DNA, and protein in them, and heavy metals, and
[00:13:02.357 --> 00:13:05.379]  You know, synthetic lipid nanoparticles.
[00:13:05.719 --> 00:13:08.781]  They're not spike proteins floating through the air.
[00:13:09.201 --> 00:13:16.045]  And so what I learned with my PhD thesis that I defended November 14, 1991,
[00:13:19.387 --> 00:13:28.610]  After Magic Johnson, the week before, was all over the news having tested positive for HIV.
[00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.152]  And this was just the brilliance of Mickey Willis as we learned to communicate.
[00:13:33.512 --> 00:13:39.374]  As I sat with him for hundreds of hours and had just, he couldn't understand.
[00:13:39.454 --> 00:13:43.295]  I mean, we couldn't communicate because I didn't know what he didn't know.
[00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:45.456]  We didn't know our perspectives.
[00:13:45.916 --> 00:13:51.020]  And so then one day he sat there and he said, yeah, this is all just fear porn.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.022]  Why don't we throw up the clip?
[00:13:53.062 --> 00:13:54.083]  This is fear porn.
[00:13:54.123 --> 00:14:03.330]  They're telling you the SV40 enhancer promoter has been in every infectious molecular clone.
[00:14:03.771 --> 00:14:06.353]  That is molecular biology.
[00:14:06.733 --> 00:14:21.780]  My PhD thesis proved it didn't matter where the virus came from, but HIV was injected in every hepatitis B vaccine starting in 1991.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.581]  They knew they could get away with it.
[00:14:24.961 --> 00:14:27.342]  HIV was gain of function.
[00:14:27.883 --> 00:14:32.965]  It never was LAV that Luc Montagnier isolated
[00:14:33.585 --> 00:14:39.469]  First, from people with gay men with gay-related immune deficiency.
[00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:51.497]  Tony Fauci said only gay men, IV drug users, and prostitutes could get, yes, could get, start there, could get AIDS.
[00:14:51.957 --> 00:14:58.803]  You know, AIDS is and always was, thank you David Martin, injection of bioweapon.
[00:14:59.163 --> 00:15:06.510]  They had to inject defective viruses that aren't transmissible and infectious.
[00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:15.958]  This was my 1992, my only appearance at the satanic Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
[00:15:16.738 --> 00:15:20.719]  Meeting that on retrovirology that happens every year.
[00:15:20.739 --> 00:15:32.903]  You know, this all started in 1934, and the brilliant, fabulous Kenteck and Lively, the attorney from, just my favorite attorney.
[00:15:32.983 --> 00:15:44.646]  So when I was J6'd and kidnapped in jail for refusing to give up the knowledge in our science paper and the data in that science paper,
[00:15:45.607 --> 00:15:47.349]  It's all vaccines.
[00:15:47.769 --> 00:15:49.191]  Back to that slide.
[00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:51.954]  It isn't always was.
[00:15:52.595 --> 00:15:55.238]  Infection by injection.
[00:15:55.658 --> 00:15:59.402]  This vaccination is not immunization.
[00:15:59.923 --> 00:16:02.724]  It's extermination and sterilization.
[00:16:03.064 --> 00:16:09.085]  And I presented this over and over again the last three years, Clay Clark meetings, anybody who will look.
[00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:17.788]  And I show you unintended consequences of three decades of liability vaccines.
[00:16:18.408 --> 00:16:20.208]  But see, this is wrong.
[00:16:20.628 --> 00:16:23.509]  Polio vaccine was never a vaccine.
[00:16:24.355 --> 00:16:27.276]  It never gave you immunity according to God.
[00:16:27.336 --> 00:16:27.857]  I'm sorry.
[00:16:28.197 --> 00:16:32.258]  The polio vaccine was never an immunization.
[00:16:32.779 --> 00:16:43.363]  So we've got to stop the corruption at the level of never again say vaccination is immunization because you had to inject
[00:16:43.843 --> 00:16:47.207]  You have to transfect the synthetic.
[00:16:47.247 --> 00:16:53.513]  You have to transfect monkey, mouse, cow, pig, aborted fetal.
[00:16:53.753 --> 00:17:02.642]  There's cow, there's cow blood, cow serum, and bird and everything else in every single shot.
[00:17:03.262 --> 00:17:05.505]  Always has been since 1991.
[00:17:08.047 --> 00:17:11.891]  The hepatitis B vaccine was liability free.
[00:17:12.191 --> 00:17:30.729]  The hepatitis B is how vaccine, how HIV got into Magic Johnson and Mickey Willis's brother and Mickey Willis's mother got the other XMRV, xenotropic
[00:17:32.106 --> 00:17:36.792]  I understand you're a scientist and I cover this all the time and I barely understand it.
[00:17:37.112 --> 00:17:40.076]  So for a lot of new viewers, boil it down first for us.
[00:17:40.617 --> 00:17:44.682]  And now that this is all coming out, it's all over the news, major studies, FDA studies.
[00:17:45.223 --> 00:17:46.585]  Okay, it's contaminated with DNA.
[00:17:46.685 --> 00:17:47.726]  Okay, it's contaminated with SV40.
[00:17:49.682 --> 00:17:50.683]  Yeah, it's contaminated.
[00:17:50.763 --> 00:17:51.964]  No, they.
[00:17:52.425 --> 00:17:53.405]  Look at the first slide.
[00:17:53.445 --> 00:17:54.466]  No, I understand.
[00:17:54.546 --> 00:17:55.527]  I know it's not contaminated.
[00:17:55.547 --> 00:17:56.168]  They put it in there.
[00:17:56.388 --> 00:18:01.553]  So explain how they do this, why they do this, and go back to what you said years ago, because now that's come out.
[00:18:01.673 --> 00:18:02.273]  Explain it to me.
[00:18:03.154 --> 00:18:10.320]  Why they wanted to use the COVID injections, how that covers up the previous ones by flooding the zone with even more contaminants.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:10.641]  Explain.
[00:18:11.448 --> 00:18:15.989]  No, because the COVID shots are synthetic.
[00:18:16.829 --> 00:18:19.930]  So the COVID shots are natural immunity.
[00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:36.293]  When it was monkey, when it was mouse, when it was cow, only the people that were injected vulnerable on the first day of life, hepatitis B vaccine, makes up your chromosome, your X chromosome.
[00:18:36.593 --> 00:18:49.580]  Your epigenetics, your own God-given protection for any virus infection, any parasite that robs oxygen from your red blood cells.
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:55.203]  So that slide shows you, that first slide shows you the asterisks.
[00:18:55.603 --> 00:19:02.867]  And the second slide shows you, and see every asterisk is several published papers.
[00:19:03.387 --> 00:19:04.668]  All these diseases
[00:19:05.288 --> 00:19:06.569]  We're good to go.
[00:19:23.951 --> 00:19:25.892]  Because read the title of that paper.
[00:19:26.133 --> 00:19:29.655]  Go to that paper and leave it with with on the screen.
[00:19:29.715 --> 00:19:35.879]  Let people see in lay terms what you showed in the clip in the beginning.
[00:19:39.642 --> 00:20:02.028]  You know, a parasite is anything that robs oxygen from your body in any way, whether it be your skin, whether it be 5G, whether it be GMO, whether it's genetically modified foods, it's environmental change on zoonotic, how things jump from animals.
[00:20:02.408 --> 00:20:03.809]  They don't jump.
[00:20:04.289 --> 00:20:12.151]  They were always injected into our tomatoes, into our cows, into our chickens.
[00:20:12.391 --> 00:20:21.033]  The fake Purina feed where our chickens start laying... And that's why they're saying they're now injecting cows and pigs with the COVID garbage.
[00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:22.414]  So they've been doing this forever.
[00:20:22.454 --> 00:20:24.634]  So what is the end game?
[00:20:24.774 --> 00:20:26.955]  Lowering our immune system, making us toxic, killing us?
[00:20:28.491 --> 00:20:42.931]  Well, correct, but because we're eating GMO, if you look at the asterisks on the second slide you just showed, it's only a few slides, that second slide, so every asterisk
[00:20:43.331 --> 00:20:49.898]  Create new viruses by recombination of the genetically modified insert.
[00:20:50.198 --> 00:20:53.742]  Well, if you do that to a tomato, it's not food.
[00:20:54.222 --> 00:21:01.450]  If you inject these, cows will produce different, you know, allergic casein peptides.
[00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:06.335]  When you inject cow blood in a newborn, every vaccine
[00:21:06.995 --> 00:21:10.760]  Since 1991, I made them.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:16.687]  I manufactured in fermentation chemistry in Fort Detrick.
[00:21:17.108 --> 00:21:25.137]  Our viral vaccines are all grown in Vero Monkey kidney cell line, the E6.
[00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:29.644]  Was SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola.
[00:21:29.824 --> 00:21:35.031]  I created the Vero E6 clone in the 90s.
[00:21:35.392 --> 00:21:41.200]  Deborah Birx and Robert Redfield injected HIV by way
[00:21:41.821 --> 00:21:51.126]  A Vero Monkey Kidney Cell Vaccine in the 90s and caused the Gulf War on the first slide.
[00:21:51.486 --> 00:21:54.328]  So you see, our food is GMO.
[00:21:54.548 --> 00:21:56.809]  Our animals are genetically modified.
[00:21:57.149 --> 00:22:03.293]  And this is what the WHO and on the high wire, we saw it the other day, this whole one world.
[00:22:03.633 --> 00:22:05.434]  Oh, you're going to eat our crickets.
[00:22:05.454 --> 00:22:08.075]  You're going to eat our... No, humans don't eat that.
[00:22:08.395 --> 00:22:10.617]  But when you look at every asterisk,
[00:22:11.556 --> 00:22:18.124]  You see, you see how they tried to poison our air, our food, our water.
[00:22:18.785 --> 00:22:22.149]  And so you see all this is it's fake meat.
[00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:28.057]  There's no such thing as plant based because our God gave us everything for free.
[00:22:28.297 --> 00:22:34.741]  And Doctor, let me stop you because now without any studies or any research, hundreds of things are flooding the zone.
[00:22:35.262 --> 00:22:39.825]  Salmon that are part grasshopper has been on store shelves five years, no labeling.
[00:22:40.185 --> 00:22:42.587]  That's Wall Street Journal, we're very proud of it.
[00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:47.650]  Just two weeks ago, they approved soybeans that grow pig protein in them.
[00:22:48.431 --> 00:22:53.574]  And now they have tomatoes that have animal protein, which I guess...
[00:22:54.855 --> 00:22:56.576]  So that's a pharmacological crop.
[00:22:56.616 --> 00:23:00.577]  People don't know for decades they've been using plants to actually grow live vaccines.
[00:23:00.837 --> 00:23:02.237]  Now they're going to feed these to us.
[00:23:03.057 --> 00:23:12.200]  And if the life expectancy is plunging, if cancer is exploding, if infertility is exploding, they know exactly what you're doing and are literally just killing everybody.
[00:23:13.782 --> 00:23:14.824]  Or trying to.
[00:23:14.924 --> 00:23:22.771]  So go to the third slide and you're going to see why this is so much fun, because we saw this a long time ago.
[00:23:22.791 --> 00:23:29.999]  The third slide on that deck should be this company, Genius Omnitura.
[00:23:30.639 --> 00:23:32.120]  I started working for them.
[00:23:32.221 --> 00:23:43.170]  I was basically unemployed because 9-1-1 destroyed our company, Epigenics Pharmaceuticals, because nobody cared about getting cancer and curing cancer.
[00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:52.497]  Epigenics Pharmaceuticals is where I took the intellectual property of my work, given to me the public-private partnership.
[00:23:52.777 --> 00:23:58.102]  When I got married October 7, 2000 and moved to Epigenics Pharmaceuticals,
[00:23:58.502 --> 00:24:00.763]  Started first May 14th of 2001.
[00:24:01.344 --> 00:24:05.847]  So what this is, and then we partnered with this company in 2005.
[00:24:05.967 --> 00:24:26.339]  We had Epigenics Pharmaceuticals, Omnitura Therapeutics, and what you see there is we harnessed the power of our God-given plants to make botanical adjuvants and use the drugs that were toxic and poison, the pills and the
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:28.600]  Is that right?
[00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:47.087]  Well, that's my next question.
[00:24:47.588 --> 00:24:48.228]  I don't understand.
[00:24:48.268 --> 00:24:51.069]  You're talking about there's ways to mitigate, and that's why I wanted you on today.
[00:24:51.089 --> 00:24:57.912]  I was talking about what's currently happening, why the rats are leaving the citizenship, what you expect to happen next, because you said a couple years ago on the show, we're going to get them, they're going to go down.
[00:24:58.332 --> 00:24:59.293]  That's not starting to happen.
[00:24:59.313 --> 00:25:00.753]  I want to hear how you think they're going to strike back.
[00:25:00.773 --> 00:25:06.336]  But here's something I see all over the fake news, and I saw it on X that people asking me.
[00:25:07.216 --> 00:25:13.221]  Why would the globalists release all this nanotech and all this GMO poison if it's going to hit them?
[00:25:13.941 --> 00:25:18.985]  Well, they have ways to mitigate it for themselves, and that's very clear.
[00:25:19.005 --> 00:25:22.168]  And then I have whistleblowers that came out, and we also confirmed in documents
[00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:23.650]  That's right.
[00:25:46.284 --> 00:25:54.391]  If you can convince anybody with that fact that London Guardian and Australian Senate reports in the Senate hearing, they're admitting they were given saline.
[00:25:54.771 --> 00:25:58.774]  That right there is smoking gun to show that they really don't want to take it themselves.
[00:25:59.115 --> 00:26:01.016]  But can you speak to that thing we hear?
[00:26:01.216 --> 00:26:05.259]  Oh, why would they do all this to the environment if it's going to attack them?
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.481]  But I've also noticed like the 5G.
[00:26:08.562 --> 00:26:09.863]  I know the globalists.
[00:26:09.903 --> 00:26:10.484]  I track them.
[00:26:10.544 --> 00:26:11.885]  I've actually met with some of them off record.
[00:26:12.205 --> 00:26:14.687]  They all live in rural areas away from 5G.
[00:26:14.947 --> 00:26:17.770]  They quietly fund laws to not allow 5G.
[00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:24.075]  In West Virginia, the New York Times reported on this, there's an ultra-rich encampment by a SETI
[00:26:26.237 --> 00:26:27.198]  We're good to go.
[00:26:50.305 --> 00:26:51.987]  Now that's, you're exactly right.
[00:26:52.447 --> 00:26:56.051]  So you see they poisoned, and this is Lee Merritt showed us this.
[00:26:56.391 --> 00:27:00.215]  They poisoned, you know, they put these towers all up over our land.
[00:27:00.276 --> 00:27:02.358]  It goes all the way back to the telegraph.
[00:27:02.758 --> 00:27:03.058]  Why?
[00:27:03.179 --> 00:27:04.700]  So they've got the seeds.
[00:27:05.041 --> 00:27:08.384]  We've got all the seeds at the National Cancer Institute.
[00:27:08.664 --> 00:27:11.948]  We have a repository in fermentation chemistry.
[00:27:12.268 --> 00:27:22.856]  My very first job at Fort Detrick has the repository of all the plants and the things and from the seeds and the soils and the soil microbes.
[00:27:22.936 --> 00:27:27.399]  We have all of those and we the people own them.
[00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:32.461]  So you see, all we have to do is chop down these towers, grow our own food.
[00:27:32.781 --> 00:27:34.882]  This is what we, you know, we have.
[00:27:34.942 --> 00:27:36.743]  That's what that patent is.
[00:27:37.123 --> 00:27:40.084]  Botanical adjuvants, helpers.
[00:27:40.385 --> 00:27:48.828]  We're gonna seal our immune system off from the poison because it's not the poison, it's the pathway.
[00:27:49.128 --> 00:27:52.610]  And our God gave us redundant pathways of healing.
[00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:54.771]  They can't hack our DNA.
[00:27:55.451 --> 00:27:58.812]  They can't get into our chromosomes.
[00:27:59.412 --> 00:28:07.235]  All we have to do is eat food with cows that aren't eating bovine being fed corn.
[00:28:07.275 --> 00:28:08.756]  They have grass stomachs.
[00:28:09.056 --> 00:28:14.178]  So all we have to do is grow our own food and do that game.
[00:28:14.278 --> 00:28:16.118]  No more fear porn.
[00:28:16.518 --> 00:28:17.919]  No more GMO.
[00:28:18.579 --> 00:28:31.348]  No more, because the retroviruses, all the monkey, mouse, cow, pig, aborted fetal, mRNA, DNA and protein is right there.
[00:28:31.928 --> 00:28:33.730]  Why the COVID shots in 2009?
[00:28:35.931 --> 00:28:52.019]  When our science paper came out and we showed them all of this, John Coffin and Jonathan Stoy at the UK and Tony Komaroff in New York and Ian Lipkin in Columbia, they were the gatekeepers of the literature.
[00:28:52.079 --> 00:28:58.062]  They took the immunology out of that paper as if we didn't have the protection.
[00:28:58.462 --> 00:29:04.326]  But we showed you the signature of disease before we isolated the variant.
[00:29:04.666 --> 00:29:22.758]  So what I'm showing you and why I'm so excited is because right there in that patent, filed 2010, and the patent I held for the PCR of all variants of COVID, SARS-CoV-2 was
[00:29:22.978 --> 00:29:27.061]  The paper is injected in every polio vaccine since 2004.
[00:29:27.202 --> 00:29:31.185]  The paper is more at all.
[00:29:31.245 --> 00:29:33.206]  It's on our Web site.
[00:29:33.467 --> 00:29:35.508]  We've been showing you for a year.
[00:29:35.829 --> 00:29:43.455]  So they're in a big old hurry to put everybody in fear porn because they don't want you to know that we, the
[00:29:48.499 --> 00:30:00.147]  The New York Times showed you it clips together because on that very first slide of the disease, Lyme disease is HIV, AIDS, neuro AIDS.
[00:30:00.407 --> 00:30:18.119]  They took out a 23 base pair deletion, which we at the National Cancer Institute, and this is the work of Mary Carrington and Mike Dean on that science paper, they showed if you had that virus circulating
[00:30:18.879 --> 00:30:36.453]  In your blood, that HIV with 32 base pair deletion, you could have all the HIV you wanted in your blood and you would never get AIDS because you don't have the inflammatory cytokine signature of disease.
[00:30:36.493 --> 00:30:44.839]  So you see, all we have to do is, you know, and that company is bankrupt right now because we went
[00:30:47.381 --> 00:30:57.290]  From 2005 when I met them, all the technology, and so is Epigenics Pharmaceuticals, technologies and patents were stolen.
[00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:58.911]  This is what's happening.
[00:30:59.332 --> 00:31:02.214]  AI didn't discover anything.
[00:31:03.572 --> 00:31:10.015]  We the people, we the good people, in those labs, the gatekeepers are few and far between.
[00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:13.137]  And we can take back our entire country.
[00:31:13.177 --> 00:31:24.963]  No, I understand, Dr. McIvitts, I understand there's an awakening, and I understand that natural compounds, God gave us the way to counter all this, but how important is it that they're building safe zones, they call quiet zones,
[00:31:25.683 --> 00:31:36.572]  Up in northern Canada, right where the tree line ends, their own little towns in Hawaii, in New Zealand, in Tasmania, and in other areas.
[00:31:36.592 --> 00:31:37.993]  I mean, this is in the news.
[00:31:38.033 --> 00:31:40.274]  I told people about it a decade ago, but now it's in the news.
[00:31:40.314 --> 00:31:41.295]  And I know some of these people.
[00:31:41.315 --> 00:31:43.417]  I've met with some of them and they don't like what's going on now.
[00:31:43.937 --> 00:31:48.381]  And they're moving to these areas to wait this out, what they've done.
[00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:55.746]  But now, as you said, there's all these scientists and doctors and everybody coming out and governments and people are really getting what's going on.
[00:31:56.127 --> 00:31:59.389]  So their attack, what were they attempting to do with the COVID rollout?
[00:31:59.569 --> 00:32:01.531]  I know you said this before, but quantify it for folks.
[00:32:02.411 --> 00:32:05.893]  And then how is it going for them and what do we need to do?
[00:32:05.913 --> 00:32:06.393]  I get it.
[00:32:06.633 --> 00:32:07.554]  Take care of ourselves.
[00:32:07.634 --> 00:32:08.614]  Those are the awake people.
[00:32:08.995 --> 00:32:21.141]  How do I first awaken people by explaining what's happened and that the elites, the demons, are literally running to safe zones away from everything they've done to us to try to wake this out?
[00:32:22.725 --> 00:32:26.826]  Well, because you see, they knew this work on that patent.
[00:32:26.946 --> 00:32:34.627]  We had University of British Columbia up in British Columbia where where the best natural product medicine was done.
[00:32:35.127 --> 00:32:37.768]  So you see who the investigators were.
[00:32:37.808 --> 00:32:38.448]  Chinese were.
[00:32:38.748 --> 00:32:39.548]  It's beautiful.
[00:32:39.788 --> 00:32:40.748]  We have the best.
[00:32:40.809 --> 00:32:46.010]  We have Bill and Lena Gerwig on from San Diego, the best marine biologist.
[00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.070]  See, we my first
[00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:55.192]  Job and love before molecular before these technologies was to heal with plants.
[00:32:55.612 --> 00:32:57.313]  And so we've already done that.
[00:32:57.513 --> 00:33:08.997]  If we use this, if we use this formula and we create our own safe zones, the next slide should show you the next slide should show you real time.
[00:33:09.617 --> 00:33:16.700]  How how we did how we and I'm just going to say we but this is the next slide.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:24.563]  There was John Hewlett and what I call living water and it's a product called Cardio Miracle.
[00:33:24.583 --> 00:33:28.545]  So I'll have you so you see this functional paper.
[00:33:29.305 --> 00:33:30.106]  is key.
[00:33:30.567 --> 00:33:36.134]  So it's the three key pathways of all things COVID.
[00:33:36.875 --> 00:33:45.286]  Ah, the management of nitric oxide, your endothelium, the blood vessels will heal those with food.
[00:33:45.726 --> 00:33:47.267]  Vitamin D deficiencies.
[00:33:47.307 --> 00:33:50.230]  You don't drink it because you'll hurt the black people.
[00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:56.114]  You make it with the sunshine and atherosclerosis.
[00:33:56.495 --> 00:33:57.876]  Look at the next slide.
[00:33:58.737 --> 00:34:03.220]  And this is a download straight from God to John Hewlett.
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.563]  And I love him that I got to meet him.
[00:34:07.263 --> 00:34:11.627]  In October 24th of 2021.
[00:34:12.047 --> 00:34:14.089]  And he showed me this.
[00:34:14.549 --> 00:34:18.092]  This paper wasn't published until August 15th of 2022.
[00:34:19.013 --> 00:34:21.134]  This is the pathways.
[00:34:21.234 --> 00:34:22.676]  This is using.
[00:34:22.736 --> 00:34:24.157]  This is David Martin.
[00:34:24.617 --> 00:34:33.305]  And Stan Graham at Cardio Miracle and use the technologies to do your own A.I.
[00:34:33.385 --> 00:34:34.165]  And we did.
[00:34:34.185 --> 00:34:39.490]  This hits the three key pathways of all things COVID.
[00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:40.391]  This is your
[00:34:40.811 --> 00:34:41.011]  Yeah.
[00:35:10.851 --> 00:35:11.872]  Okay, well let's speak to that.
[00:35:11.932 --> 00:35:12.953]  Let's speak to that if you want to know.
[00:35:13.553 --> 00:35:18.437]  Because, and we're doing a plug for this great product, which I know is amazing, and I want to get it and probably carry it.
[00:35:19.118 --> 00:35:22.200]  Without me even asking you a few years ago, you said, oh my God, your nitric boost is really great.
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.422]  I guess it's got some of the same natural compounds.
[00:35:24.462 --> 00:35:26.363]  People take it and go, whoa, they have all these effects.
[00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:27.204]  We don't sell it for...
[00:35:28.385 --> 00:35:37.832]  Let me go there, because what we did with your nitric boost, and I didn't say it then, but I was using it for the for the people with COVID.
[00:35:37.892 --> 00:35:46.679]  I'm saying, OK, but it had to be on the foundation of the cardio miracle because it's not a nitric oxide booster cardio miracle.
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.862]  It allows you to make enos.
[00:35:50.763 --> 00:35:54.368]  The endothelial nitric oxide synthetase.
[00:35:54.648 --> 00:35:55.910]  You synthesize it.
[00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:56.691]  You make it.
[00:35:56.951 --> 00:35:58.293]  You heal your blood vessels.
[00:35:58.333 --> 00:35:59.835]  Oh, so it makes your body make it?
[00:36:00.779 --> 00:36:01.900]  Correct!
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.503]  And then I add your boost, which is also food.
[00:36:05.583 --> 00:36:11.448]  I just look at the ingredients and say, ah, and then I know how to supplement.
[00:36:11.768 --> 00:36:19.114]  But the foundation after all things COVID is that simple liquid in a powder.
[00:36:19.414 --> 00:36:26.040]  Clean from all the toxins, clean from the glyphosate, clean from all the GMO crap, clean from the heavy metals.
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.182]  And all you need is one glass, and we could heal.
[00:36:31.222 --> 00:36:32.702]  And see, we did it.
[00:36:32.822 --> 00:36:33.542]  We lived it.
[00:36:33.622 --> 00:36:39.944]  We ran around this county in Ventura County, and we immunized people, and that's what we have to do now.
[00:36:39.964 --> 00:36:41.405]  And by the way, let me raise that now.
[00:36:41.725 --> 00:36:49.087]  They are now mainstream news admitting that what you're talking about, and the compounds and plants to clean out the heart.
[00:36:49.127 --> 00:36:51.748]  But let's go to the problem first, because viewers want to know this.
[00:36:51.768 --> 00:36:55.249]  They're not a respected scientist like you with all these papers.
[00:36:56.599 --> 00:36:58.160]  What does COVID do?
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:02.902]  Why do they have TV ads that many kids are having heart attacks and myocarditis at record levels all over the world where they took it?
[00:37:02.922 --> 00:37:06.324]  Obviously, they were attacking our cardiovascular system was part of it.
[00:37:06.704 --> 00:37:09.045]  It attacks the fertility and turbo cancers.
[00:37:09.065 --> 00:37:13.888]  I know you're talking about the solutions to it, but explain what is in the COVID shots that does this, doctor?
[00:37:15.188 --> 00:37:16.309]  Show the last slide.
[00:37:16.489 --> 00:37:17.169]  Okay, last slide.
[00:37:17.209 --> 00:37:17.489]  Go ahead.
[00:37:17.509 --> 00:37:17.950]  Next slide.
[00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:19.070]  Here it is.
[00:37:21.571 --> 00:37:21.992]  Okay.
[00:37:22.132 --> 00:37:22.372]  Yeah.
[00:37:23.328 --> 00:37:28.050]  Because you ingest synthetic syncytin.
[00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:29.491]  Sorry, it's spelled wrong.
[00:37:29.911 --> 00:37:32.292]  Synthesize cells together.
[00:37:32.492 --> 00:37:33.252]  Cyto.
[00:37:33.752 --> 00:37:34.913]  Syncytin.
[00:37:35.413 --> 00:37:37.254]  Synthetic syncytin.
[00:37:37.754 --> 00:37:41.036]  Our body makes syncytin.
[00:37:41.416 --> 00:37:47.058]  It's a protein that... Wait a minute, so they're programming people with a synthetic thing that we already need.
[00:37:47.879 --> 00:37:48.499]  So then it doesn't...
[00:37:49.159 --> 00:37:50.219]  And then we attack.
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:51.240]  We attack.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.520]  Not that we already need.
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.201]  It's critical for all of life.
[00:37:55.541 --> 00:37:56.802]  For fertilization.
[00:37:57.082 --> 00:37:59.303]  So they put a synthetic one in.
[00:37:59.663 --> 00:38:02.724]  Our body looks at it and says, that's not me.
[00:38:03.044 --> 00:38:05.005]  And it can't break it down.
[00:38:05.385 --> 00:38:09.327]  We could break down the monkey, the mouse, the cow, the aborted fetal.
[00:38:09.647 --> 00:38:11.948]  And it took too much time to kill us.
[00:38:12.268 --> 00:38:13.508]  The latency period.
[00:38:13.768 --> 00:38:18.230]  That's what Burke showed on the clip that you could play the clip tomorrow.
[00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:24.953]  See, they know what they're doing and they're legally liable after our paper in 2009.
[00:38:25.273 --> 00:38:25.933]  Stop right there.
[00:38:25.973 --> 00:38:29.814]  This is too important because I've interviewed you many times and you're so smart you move quick.
[00:38:29.874 --> 00:38:33.916]  Let's slow down and start over because now you've explained the key here.
[00:38:34.196 --> 00:38:40.278]  They were hitting us with all this other zoological outside systems that we were able to beat, but now they've gotten smart.
[00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:43.960]  They create a synthetic version of our basic building block.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:48.521]  Turn it into a parasite when in our body it's the opposite of a parasite.
[00:38:48.881 --> 00:38:54.502]  And so then our body takes it into the heart, all of this, and then attacks the capillaries, the arteries, the ventricles.
[00:38:55.162 --> 00:38:59.063]  And so our body sees this and basically sees it as basically like cancer.
[00:38:59.083 --> 00:39:00.183]  I'm not a scientist, explain to me.
[00:39:00.423 --> 00:39:01.423]  But this is so cute.
[00:39:01.703 --> 00:39:02.904]  Start over slowly.
[00:39:03.544 --> 00:39:05.424]  Everybody listen to her explain this.
[00:39:05.804 --> 00:39:08.025]  But keep showing the picture.
[00:39:08.065 --> 00:39:08.505]  We will, here it is.
[00:39:09.961 --> 00:39:14.882]  Keep showing the picture because I've tried over and over again to put this.
[00:39:15.302 --> 00:39:22.343]  At the bottom right corner is my pen pointing to Syncytia.
[00:39:23.643 --> 00:39:25.784]  We used to call it aneuploidy.
[00:39:26.184 --> 00:39:28.664]  Anything that sticks cells together.
[00:39:28.944 --> 00:39:38.346]  Well, that synthetic peptide is critical for us to hold the fertilized embryo into the uterine cell wall.
[00:39:38.846 --> 00:39:58.036]  So, the reason why the COVID shots in 2009, because of the 1986 Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, if you could make a vaccine safer, and you failed to do so,
[00:39:58.856 --> 00:40:01.579]  Then you're liable for everything.
[00:40:01.939 --> 00:40:20.294]  So when your government saw our science paper and it showed we were creating with the injections, which were always bioweapons, because they had to inject and bypass our innate immune system, our skin, our nose.
[00:40:20.574 --> 00:40:26.879]  The mask caused COVID because we have protection with only two breaths.
[00:40:27.359 --> 00:40:31.703]  Our HIF-1 alpha hypoxia inducible factor.
[00:40:32.024 --> 00:40:36.308]  It goes on and says you need oxygen and you've got to take that off.
[00:40:36.428 --> 00:40:39.070]  It's a blowtorch on cancer.
[00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:43.414]  So your back to the syncytin is the key peptide.
[00:40:43.694 --> 00:40:50.360]  They had to get the synthetic in the shot and then they would kill those specific populations
[00:40:51.121 --> 00:40:55.023]  Those, HIV alone would not do it.
[00:40:55.543 --> 00:40:59.225]  SARS-CoV-2 had to have HIV.
[00:40:59.785 --> 00:41:05.688]  Monkey, monkey virus did, SIV, did not do it.
[00:41:05.948 --> 00:41:10.310]  And mouse XMRVs are in everything.
[00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:17.773]  And so the key is, is that we hold the patent, I did, they stole it from, doesn't matter, for all
[00:41:17.933 --> 00:41:19.535]  All of the PCRs.
[00:41:19.895 --> 00:41:21.757]  I can tell you every variant.
[00:41:22.077 --> 00:41:27.323]  The key for everything, whether it's bird flu, swine flu, never inject again.
[00:41:27.803 --> 00:41:36.712]  Teresa Dysher did some beautiful work in vaccine court and we and the Gaudi paper from two thousand and seventeen.
[00:41:37.112 --> 00:41:39.655]  It's so important to look at the years.
[00:41:40.355 --> 00:41:42.897]  And this is why I was so angry this week.
[00:41:43.137 --> 00:41:48.080]  So if you look at that last slide again, I'm showing you heroes of the faith.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:55.465]  Bobby Kennedy is sitting in Godspeed Church sometime in January or February of 2021.
[00:41:57.846 --> 00:42:03.267]  And so he came, Rob McCoy looked a lot younger than he, we're taking a pounding.
[00:42:03.607 --> 00:42:11.008]  Rob McCoy is just a hero in this whole thing because he's a Republican.
[00:42:11.328 --> 00:42:16.629]  And so when Ronald Reagan removed all liability, he didn't remove it all.
[00:42:16.689 --> 00:42:26.211]  He removed it from big pharma and he placed it on health and human services and every level of your government.
[00:42:34.538 --> 00:42:37.821]  That is key, but I want you to go back because you went over it quickly.
[00:42:37.901 --> 00:42:46.129]  Explain again what's happening to the heart and how they put in this synthetic compound that's in our body so our body attacks itself, which we know is happening.
[00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:48.151]  Explain that again slowly.
[00:42:48.191 --> 00:42:49.112]  That's so important.
[00:42:51.376 --> 00:43:04.600]  It's the only family of retroviruses that infects all cells of the human body and all animals.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:08.922]  Cows, mammals, lizards have syncytin.
[00:43:09.482 --> 00:43:12.763]  All people who carry their young, mammals,
[00:43:13.303 --> 00:43:17.306]  So every cell of the body, including the sperm and the egg.
[00:43:17.726 --> 00:43:25.832]  So they had to put that synthetic one in, in order to kill certain populations.
[00:43:27.053 --> 00:43:36.801]  Pastor Rob, when I was frustrated trying to explain it to him, he said, Judy, have you ever seen the bottom of Darwin's thesis?
[00:43:37.501 --> 00:43:42.802]  And I'm like, I don't know, by natural immune selection, I'm thinking and I'm trying to explain this.
[00:43:43.402 --> 00:43:44.482]  He's doing what you're doing.
[00:43:44.542 --> 00:43:46.303]  He's interrupted me or looking at his phone.
[00:43:46.683 --> 00:43:55.504]  And he said, no, it says or preservation of favored races in the struggle for life.
[00:43:55.864 --> 00:43:59.125]  And I'm like, oh, my God, there is no struggle for life.
[00:43:59.445 --> 00:44:04.846]  This is this is the cult of scientism playing evolution games.
[00:44:05.166 --> 00:44:07.767]  We didn't become monkeys and stand up.
[00:44:08.088 --> 00:44:12.290]  They had to put synthetic in because they couldn't kill us.
[00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:14.591]  They couldn't get to the seed.
[00:44:14.911 --> 00:44:19.914]  They couldn't get to the fertilized embryo instead of that shot.
[00:44:20.454 --> 00:44:26.877]  And the reason I'm still go back to that last slide because this matters for when we elect.
[00:44:27.177 --> 00:44:30.459]  Everything you're saying in the most important election
[00:44:31.119 --> 00:44:35.624]  OK, my pen is pointing to COVID in the bottom right.
[00:44:36.024 --> 00:44:36.985]  And that picture is 2006.
[00:44:37.025 --> 00:44:36.985]  2006!
[00:44:37.225 --> 00:44:38.406]  Why did I know?
[00:44:38.787 --> 00:44:40.488]  It's right here.
[00:44:40.568 --> 00:44:41.209]  The picture says INIP.
[00:44:49.517 --> 00:44:52.919]  And so pro-choice is pro-life.
[00:44:53.519 --> 00:44:56.520]  Immunization is not vaccination.
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:58.481]  See what INIP said?
[00:44:58.901 --> 00:45:00.402]  That's my handwriting.
[00:45:00.422 --> 00:45:00.922]  Flip it around.
[00:45:00.962 --> 00:45:01.642]  Show us the picture.
[00:45:02.683 --> 00:45:03.963]  Dr. Migos, let me stop you.
[00:45:04.023 --> 00:45:07.505]  You came on four years ago and said you saw COVID in the lab.
[00:45:08.125 --> 00:45:09.346]  It's now come out in documents.
[00:45:10.006 --> 00:45:19.252]  That as you said, five, six, seven, eight years ago, they were calling it COVID and even COVID-19 in 2018 in their files at EcoHealth Alliance.
[00:45:19.272 --> 00:45:20.753]  So they were obsessed with this.
[00:45:21.634 --> 00:45:24.296]  And you're saying this is... It's AIDS.
[00:45:24.616 --> 00:45:28.618]  So if you could play the last clip, you're going to see it.
[00:45:28.979 --> 00:45:35.763]  This is the cover of our book, Plague of Corruption, which came out this circle, right?
[00:45:36.264 --> 00:45:37.584]  This one on this side.
[00:45:37.604 --> 00:45:39.746]  Let me see if I can get my finger over there.
[00:45:39.906 --> 00:45:39.974]  You
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:45.102]  It's over top of my, not my ring finger, my other finger.
[00:45:45.282 --> 00:45:55.285]  This is the cover of Plague and they changed it very quickly so you couldn't see that we knew this in 2014.
[00:45:56.886 --> 00:45:58.607]  We gave this book.
[00:45:59.047 --> 00:46:01.688]  That's the last chapter of Plague of Corruption.
[00:46:02.028 --> 00:46:04.909]  Maybe there's one last story I should tell you.
[00:46:05.489 --> 00:46:09.751]  We have all the proof and we have all
[00:46:10.211 --> 00:46:12.893]  The healing in the freezer.
[00:46:12.953 --> 00:46:14.614]  I've got the freezers.
[00:46:15.034 --> 00:46:16.655]  It's secure, folks.
[00:46:17.235 --> 00:46:24.179]  All you need to do is elect a president, either Trump or Kennedy, and Kennedy is the one.
[00:46:24.579 --> 00:46:27.801]  He had the moral courage to write that
[00:46:28.041 --> 00:46:28.661]  Forward.
[00:46:29.021 --> 00:46:33.243]  And I thank God that he didn't understand it in the summer of 2019.
[00:46:35.184 --> 00:46:50.449]  We started writing that book the minute I met Brian Hooker and learned what that criminal, William Thompson, had done to cover up the data that if little black boys in Atlanta got the
[00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:53.851]  MMR before three years of age.
[00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:57.353]  They would get a nonspecific, it's called eosinophilia.
[00:46:57.494 --> 00:46:59.455]  This is what Andy Wakefield did.
[00:46:59.795 --> 00:47:02.597]  We showed you the truth all along.
[00:47:02.677 --> 00:47:08.481]  So that last slide I wrote at the bottom, pro-choice is pro-life.
[00:47:08.921 --> 00:47:12.383]  We can choose how to immunize our kids.
[00:47:12.703 --> 00:47:14.925]  We must immunize them now.
[00:47:15.405 --> 00:47:17.908]  With plants, with non-GMO, with food.
[00:47:18.408 --> 00:47:20.070]  I, we know how to do it.
[00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:22.693]  It's all right there in the house.
[00:47:23.594 --> 00:47:24.715]  Michael, stay right there.
[00:47:25.095 --> 00:47:25.956]  This is important.
[00:47:26.376 --> 00:47:27.237]  I know you know this.
[00:47:27.377 --> 00:47:27.918]  It's on record.
[00:47:27.958 --> 00:47:28.579]  It's all come out.
[00:47:28.899 --> 00:47:29.540]  It's all true.
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:30.681]  You're trying to save the world.
[00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:32.042]  It's frustrating.
[00:47:32.703 --> 00:47:36.006]  But just going back, that's what is now in the literature.
[00:47:36.026 --> 00:47:38.008]  And I'm not a scientist, but I know how to read it.
[00:47:38.729 --> 00:47:40.751]  They literally hit us with everything they could.
[00:47:40.771 --> 00:47:45.194]  It killed a bunch of people with cancer, but didn't get what they wanted with depopulation and infertility.
[00:47:45.594 --> 00:47:49.717]  So they go in with a synthetic, basic building block of all life.
[00:47:49.878 --> 00:47:51.999]  Lizards, fish, humans, everything.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:58.644]  And they've basically released a bomb to attack carbon-based life forms.
[00:47:59.044 --> 00:48:00.385]  They're trying to ban carbon.
[00:48:00.606 --> 00:48:01.546]  They're saying it's bad.
[00:48:01.586 --> 00:48:02.547]  We're carbon, folks.
[00:48:02.587 --> 00:48:06.770]  So this is literally an anti-life torpedo
[00:48:07.904 --> 00:48:12.025]  That they fired, and that's why they're injecting the farm animals, everything now.
[00:48:13.465 --> 00:48:15.245]  And now the Holocaust is just rolling forward.
[00:48:15.566 --> 00:48:17.646]  Now they're saying we're not going to have any approval anymore.
[00:48:17.886 --> 00:48:18.946]  We're just going to no law.
[00:48:18.966 --> 00:48:21.127]  We're going to give everybody mRNA for everything.
[00:48:21.567 --> 00:48:22.407]  Oh, what about this?
[00:48:23.107 --> 00:48:24.407]  OK, cancer is exploding.
[00:48:24.667 --> 00:48:31.669]  And Albert Bourla, the mad scientist, Joseph Mingala over there at Pfizer said last week, I played the clip like 10 times.
[00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:33.529]  He's probably more than 10 times.
[00:48:33.849 --> 00:48:34.989]  He probably saw the clip.
[00:48:35.049 --> 00:48:35.810]  If not, we'll pull it in.
[00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:37.050]  He said
[00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:39.211]  Cancer is the new COVID.
[00:48:39.272 --> 00:48:40.313]  Cancer is exploding.
[00:48:40.373 --> 00:48:41.534]  We're going to take over the world.
[00:48:41.574 --> 00:48:44.957]  We're going to heal you with mRNA cancer treatment.
[00:48:44.998 --> 00:48:46.699]  No!
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:51.144]  We have a body given mRNA.
[00:48:51.664 --> 00:48:53.586]  So cancer is not exploding.
[00:48:53.667 --> 00:48:57.711]  They knew this and they did this on purpose.
[00:48:58.111 --> 00:48:59.993]  And your cure is right there.
[00:49:00.834 --> 00:49:07.661]  I mean, I know they did it on purpose, it's all admitted, but what I'm saying is, what I'm saying is, and I know you're talking about the natural cause, I'm talking about their guilt.
[00:49:08.201 --> 00:49:13.827]  So, what do you make of him admitting Canadians exploded and licking his lips and saying now they're going to be the savior?
[00:49:13.927 --> 00:49:15.128]  Obviously, they're not going to be the savior.
[00:49:15.408 --> 00:49:17.811]  I'm asking you, what do you think they're going to pull now?
[00:49:19.389 --> 00:49:26.352]  Well, they told you, and that's the last clip with Deborah Birx, and it's the media leaving the way.
[00:49:26.833 --> 00:49:28.634]  They're trying to convince you.
[00:49:28.654 --> 00:49:30.935]  They didn't release it.
[00:49:31.015 --> 00:49:32.355]  They injected it.
[00:49:32.415 --> 00:49:34.096]  They must inject.
[00:49:34.456 --> 00:49:38.358]  They must inject, and we must ingest GMO.
[00:49:38.378 --> 00:49:39.479]  The shot is what does it.
[00:49:39.839 --> 00:49:40.239]  I get that.
[00:49:40.259 --> 00:49:40.599]  You're right.
[00:49:40.639 --> 00:49:46.682]  And now they're all doing an apology to her, trying to get us to trust them again so they can carry out the next operation.
[00:49:46.702 --> 00:49:47.443]  So here is the
[00:49:48.323 --> 00:49:51.949]  Deborah Birx clip talking about this that you sent us.
[00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:53.271]  Here is that clip.
[00:49:54.670 --> 00:50:01.794]  The reason the comparison to HIV is important is because HIV was also asymptomatic.
[00:50:02.215 --> 00:50:08.959]  I mean, you couldn't see the virus through symptoms because people were infected for 7, 8, 9 years before they developed symptoms.
[00:50:09.699 --> 00:50:18.505]  But HIV quietly destroyed our immune system and we learned a lot about immunology from HIV and it's changed completely our cancer therapy.
[00:50:19.085 --> 00:50:34.508]  We're learning now about mitochondria and viral impact and brain fog and the changes in our neurons and the cells that nourish our neurons that really allow us to think and move.
[00:50:34.788 --> 00:50:37.849]  And we're learning that because of what Long Covid has done.
[00:50:37.929 --> 00:50:41.090]  And so there's two sides of this coin every time.
[00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:43.030]  There's a lot of destruction.
[00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:45.811]  That mild and moderate COVID can do.
[00:50:45.931 --> 00:50:49.913]  That is on scene, just like HIV was destroying our immune system.
[00:50:49.973 --> 00:50:55.475]  But what came out of that is brilliant science that changed how we treated HIV.
[00:50:55.495 --> 00:51:02.678]  And if you're diagnosed today, you can live a very normal lifespan and people not only survive, but thrive.
[00:51:02.818 --> 00:51:10.841]  We need to get to the place where people with long COVID, we've done the research so that people with long COVID can not only survive, but thrive.
[00:51:11.241 --> 00:51:13.569]  All right, Dr. Mikulich, I know you're sitting there shaking your head.
[00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:15.033]  You'll get to go after her in a minute.
[00:51:15.697 --> 00:51:19.179]  But we know the spike protein on there was, you know, reportedly the HIV.
[00:51:19.199 --> 00:51:21.380]  Again, it's not a spike protein.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.381]  It's a synthetic virus.
[00:51:23.401 --> 00:51:24.141]  I understand that.
[00:51:24.462 --> 00:51:26.222]  There is no long COVID.
[00:51:26.283 --> 00:51:29.324]  They did this in 1934 and in 1962.
[00:51:29.904 --> 00:51:34.547]  This, the research, we cured it a long time ago.
[00:51:34.887 --> 00:51:37.909]  And all we need to do is put that biatch in jail.
[00:51:38.649 --> 00:51:40.170]  They didn't, there's no research.
[00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:41.450]  It's already been done.
[00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:42.031]  I understand.
[00:51:43.111 --> 00:51:47.072]  I understand you're pissed and this is all coming out.
[00:51:47.392 --> 00:51:50.793]  I'm pissed because people don't have to be afraid.
[00:51:51.293 --> 00:51:56.015]  They need to shut down the entire NIH.
[00:51:56.435 --> 00:52:03.637]  They need to convict Jason Chavitz and every single person that sits there and lies on these TV screens.
[00:52:04.517 --> 00:52:05.959]  You caused AIDS.
[00:52:06.279 --> 00:52:07.781]  HIV isn't AIDS.
[00:52:08.121 --> 00:52:09.803]  And it wasn't a silent killer.
[00:52:10.063 --> 00:52:12.326]  Magic Johnson never got AIDS, did he?
[00:52:12.346 --> 00:52:14.368]  Because of my PhD thesis in 1991.
[00:52:14.408 --> 00:52:16.491]  You never inject somebody with HIV.
[00:52:23.238 --> 00:52:29.639]  The point is, call this a synthetic nanoparticle prion growth, whatever.
[00:52:29.659 --> 00:52:31.300]  We're being colonized by this.
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.920]  You're frustrated saying there's ways to knock it out.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:40.782]  How does, because this is a question I get on the street everywhere, I have so many people that I know that I can see them taking the shots, they're getting sick, they're dying.
[00:52:41.662 --> 00:52:44.342]  I try to warn them, they can't believe that the government would do this to them.
[00:52:45.083 --> 00:52:51.204]  What do people do to mitigate this synthetic nanoparticle colonies that are growing in our tissues?
[00:52:53.235 --> 00:52:54.176]  Neutrify.
[00:52:54.496 --> 00:52:55.858]  No more GMO.
[00:52:56.338 --> 00:53:01.964]  Cardio Miracle is the living water, the foundation for all things COVID.
[00:53:02.524 --> 00:53:02.644]  All.
[00:53:02.945 --> 00:53:05.988]  Those are the three key pathways.
[00:53:06.388 --> 00:53:08.150]  Our God protects us with
[00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:09.090]  Pathways.
[00:53:09.431 --> 00:53:11.192]  We have redundant pathways.
[00:53:11.392 --> 00:53:12.814]  Feed your immune system.
[00:53:13.094 --> 00:53:20.620]  Get out of, get the 5G, get the garbage, shut, cut those towers down that they put up that are destroying our land.
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:25.784]  Make our own safe, regenerate our soil, regenerate our water.
[00:53:26.185 --> 00:53:27.326]  Start with cardio milk.
[00:53:27.446 --> 00:53:28.927]  Buy those nutrients.
[00:53:29.267 --> 00:53:31.889]  Global healing has all kinds of liquids.
[00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:33.911]  No more pills, no more
[00:53:37.754 --> 00:53:39.596]  End the Bayh-Dole Act right now.
[00:53:40.056 --> 00:53:52.367]  Pay every single human being in the United States of America the millions of dollars of those patent royalties where they stole our patents and created the synthetic to poison.
[00:53:52.387 --> 00:53:54.108]  By the way, talk about that.
[00:53:54.128 --> 00:54:02.996]  They want to keep it secret, but not millions, billions at NIH and at the CDC with people like Fauci with the government.
[00:54:03.036 --> 00:54:05.138]  Explain what's going on there, because that's really secretive.
[00:54:06.661 --> 00:54:07.842]  Oh, yeah.
[00:54:07.922 --> 00:54:09.003]  They patented.
[00:54:09.444 --> 00:54:11.105]  You can't patent nature.
[00:54:11.505 --> 00:54:18.372]  You can't patent God unless you do it in an unobvious way, like the genius patent.
[00:54:19.973 --> 00:54:21.494]  Omnitour, that slide.
[00:54:21.875 --> 00:54:22.776]  It was nature.
[00:54:23.096 --> 00:54:25.338]  It was botanical adjuvants.
[00:54:25.738 --> 00:54:29.462]  So now we can immunize, use exactly that strategy.
[00:54:29.502 --> 00:54:33.687]  All I have to do is mix the mushrooms and I can cure the neuroimmune disease.
[00:54:34.108 --> 00:54:40.175]  All we have to do, they told you, all we have to do is go back to God and
[00:54:40.575 --> 00:54:41.735]  Let's explain this.
[00:54:42.176 --> 00:54:46.237]  At the first I played, and this is a big story,
[00:55:08.084 --> 00:55:11.589]  And I realize all we've been through and the things I've experienced, you've experienced, doesn't seem real.
[00:55:11.969 --> 00:55:14.372]  I didn't put a post on X today to brag.
[00:55:14.913 --> 00:55:15.934]  I talked to Chris Carter.
[00:55:15.974 --> 00:55:17.056]  He did a bunch of interviews.
[00:55:17.196 --> 00:55:18.097]  He wanted me to come out to LA.
[00:55:18.137 --> 00:55:18.658]  I never did it.
[00:55:18.698 --> 00:55:20.520]  I should re-contact Chris Carter.
[00:55:20.841 --> 00:55:22.943]  He's in my email somewhere, the guy that made the X-Files.
[00:55:23.344 --> 00:55:25.226]  He did a reboot right before the election in 2016.
[00:55:27.315 --> 00:55:29.876]  And he's in the news saying, I watch Alex Jones.
[00:55:30.036 --> 00:55:31.117]  I don't think he's a racist.
[00:55:31.237 --> 00:55:32.017]  I think he's right.
[00:55:32.397 --> 00:55:35.599]  He really influenced, it wasn't me, it was Dr. Group and all the guests I had on.
[00:55:36.179 --> 00:55:48.344]  He really influenced me in the character of the talk show host warning everyone of a government plan through a vaccine to break your DNA and destroy your immune system to slowly depopulate the planet.
[00:55:48.404 --> 00:55:51.366]  And I'm reading Chris Carter, so we start talking and start talking.
[00:55:51.906 --> 00:55:52.066]  It's
[00:56:14.085 --> 00:56:19.089]  With the Lone Gunman episode about flying a hijacked jet in the World Trade Center to blame Bin Laden and invade Afghanistan.
[00:56:19.409 --> 00:56:21.911]  Folks, for a new viewer, just type in Lone Gunman episode 911.
[00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:23.652]  I'm not making this up.
[00:56:23.872 --> 00:56:24.613]  No, it sounds insane.
[00:56:25.033 --> 00:56:28.215]  He said, because I asked him, he talked about it, CIA.
[00:56:28.635 --> 00:56:32.498]  Then he comes out, makes a whole show where I'm not bragging, I'm the hero.
[00:56:32.978 --> 00:56:34.540]  I don't even know what this means.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:35.740]  And then boom.
[00:56:36.781 --> 00:56:40.122]  A few years later, they actually launched the actual takeover he's talking about.
[00:56:40.422 --> 00:56:44.722]  And what Judy Mikevich is so angry about is, she has been involved in the patent.
[00:56:44.762 --> 00:56:45.363]  She's been there.
[00:56:45.423 --> 00:56:46.243]  She knows all this.
[00:56:46.483 --> 00:56:47.243]  It's all confirmed.
[00:56:47.563 --> 00:56:49.543]  And she's saying, you've got to get off the GMO.
[00:56:49.563 --> 00:56:50.443]  You've got to clean out your body.
[00:56:50.464 --> 00:56:52.724]  You've got to flood yourself with these botanicals.
[00:56:53.164 --> 00:56:56.885]  You've got to get as much sun as possible, which they tell you, lock yourself in the house.
[00:56:56.945 --> 00:56:59.985]  And they're literally, now it's blowing up in their face though.
[00:57:00.025 --> 00:57:01.666]  So I know you've given us solutions.
[00:57:01.986 --> 00:57:02.486]  That's great.
[00:57:02.546 --> 00:57:03.186]  We've heard those.
[00:57:03.206 --> 00:57:04.006]  We'll talk about it more.
[00:57:04.546 --> 00:57:18.972]  But knowing the enemy, knowing the enemy, Dr. Makovitz, and how they operate, because we need to understand this, now that they're in so much trouble and the tables have turned, I've got 50 clips I can play literally this week of them backtracking, trying to get us to trust them again.
[00:57:19.372 --> 00:57:21.333]  What do you think these bad guys are going to try now?
[00:57:22.711 --> 00:57:26.435]  Well, you know, they I they're not going to try anything.
[00:57:26.515 --> 00:57:27.976]  She just put it on TV.
[00:57:28.356 --> 00:57:31.539]  She's going to make you think they discovered all the cures.
[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:38.706]  They're telling you a I discovered prostate cancer cures was that was a heterogeneous disease.
[00:57:39.086 --> 00:57:42.890]  We discovered we wrote that patent.
[00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:45.552]  AI doesn't discover anything.
[00:57:45.873 --> 00:57:52.619]  So you see, they're trying to cover up their crimes and create another industry like they did in AIDS.
[00:57:52.919 --> 00:57:59.865]  But all those oral immunizations called Tarvigenvoya, who's responsible for this?
[00:58:00.345 --> 00:58:01.747]  Oh, remember ACT UP?
[00:58:02.327 --> 00:58:04.189]  Oh, Kaiser has to pay for it.
[00:58:04.389 --> 00:58:06.710]  The insurance industry has to pay for it.
[00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:08.911]  The government has to pay for it.
[00:58:09.231 --> 00:58:10.831]  That's what they're afraid of.
[00:58:11.132 --> 00:58:12.352]  They're all liable.
[00:58:12.732 --> 00:58:28.938]  Jason Chabot sat in his office March 31st of 2017 when every one of us doctors, Bobby Kennedy, Del Bigtree, Resilienz, Neuenschwander, Jack Lineswell, sat in the House Oversight Committee March 31st, 2017 and begged him to stop this.
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:35.341]  And we all know what he did.
[00:58:35.541 --> 00:58:36.161]  He quit.
[00:58:36.462 --> 00:58:43.065]  And he's on TV making a fortune and killing the rest of the people and preserving his own life.
[00:58:43.105 --> 00:58:44.166]  Well, that's my next question.
[00:58:44.186 --> 00:58:46.367]  What do you make of Redfield, all of them?
[00:58:46.427 --> 00:58:47.448]  He's been doing it for two years.
[00:58:47.488 --> 00:58:49.929]  He figured out he was caught saying, yeah, gain of function.
[00:58:49.969 --> 00:58:50.290]  It's illegal.
[00:58:50.310 --> 00:58:51.070]  I'm not part of it.
[00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:52.211]  They're all running.
[00:58:52.291 --> 00:58:53.411]  Now it's a stampede.
[00:58:53.431 --> 00:58:55.973]  Before it was kind of sneak off the last 10 minutes of the movie.
[00:58:56.333 --> 00:58:57.854]  Now it's like a fire in the theater.
[00:58:57.874 --> 00:58:58.975]  They're all running for the exits.
[00:58:58.995 --> 00:58:59.475]  What's happening?
[00:59:00.418 --> 00:59:01.539]  Because they're liable.
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:05.064]  They're liable for crimes against humanities.
[00:59:05.425 --> 00:59:12.694]  Because when all liability was removed from pharma, it was placed right on HHS.
[00:59:13.035 --> 00:59:14.917]  Deborah Birx and Robert Redfield
[00:59:15.418 --> 00:59:16.139]  We're good to go.
[00:59:38.637 --> 00:59:46.162]  You know, Bobby Kennedy, clean house at the EPA, the FDA, the CDC, they colluded.
[00:59:46.262 --> 00:59:53.747]  And how obvious is it Bill Gates wants to force us to eat synthetic poison meat, synthetic poison fruits, synthetic poison vegetables.
[00:59:54.068 --> 00:59:58.711]  They're literally assaulting us with poison shots and giving us fake building blocks so we can't defend.
[00:59:59.091 --> 01:00:01.553]  That's why you're, and people are like, oh God, nature.
[01:00:01.793 --> 01:00:06.217]  No, a mother, breast, milk, all of her colostrum, all the immunity, it's a fact.
[01:00:06.457 --> 01:00:11.802]  And you're just saying like, here's the real McCoy, here's the real thing, and they're trying to play God.
[01:00:12.802 --> 01:00:17.166]  And they can't, they can't, because we're not our DNA, we're our chromosomes.
[01:00:17.686 --> 01:00:19.148]  We have our own inner grace.
[01:00:19.528 --> 01:00:20.809]  We have our own prescription.
[01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:21.430]  And explain that.
[01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:27.675]  Our chromosomes program the environment, so they're trying to give us fake building blocks, so our chromosomes can't build us.
[01:00:29.571 --> 01:00:32.772]  No, our chromosomes protect our DNA.
[01:00:33.232 --> 01:00:34.572]  It's not a ladder.
[01:00:34.752 --> 01:00:36.313]  It's not as shown on TV.
[01:00:36.713 --> 01:00:40.754]  It's all wound up and protected by methyl groups and acetyl groups.
[01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:42.534]  We have modification.
[01:00:43.134 --> 01:00:48.315]  We have our own micro RNAs and mRNA in healing.
[01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:53.377]  97% of our DNA is never translated into enzymes.
[01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:54.857]  It's our protection.
[01:00:54.977 --> 01:00:56.298]  Remember what the scientists said?
[01:00:56.338 --> 01:00:58.078]  They couldn't understand it, so they called it junk.
[01:00:58.418 --> 01:00:59.259]  No, it's not junk.
[01:00:59.379 --> 01:01:00.699]  It's the backup and defense.
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:03.580]  It's the entire defense.
[01:01:03.661 --> 01:01:04.681]  It's not a backup.
[01:01:05.141 --> 01:01:06.762]  It's our primary defense.
[01:01:07.002 --> 01:01:10.343]  We're our chromosomes, and they can't hack us.
[01:01:10.803 --> 01:01:12.304]  And they know it.
[01:01:12.704 --> 01:01:15.245]  They failed in COVID.
[01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:16.246]  Because God made us.
[01:01:16.286 --> 01:01:16.906]  I mean, think about it.
[01:01:17.526 --> 01:01:21.768]  That's why they're so pissed, because they keep trying to assault it, and it doesn't work.
[01:01:23.097 --> 01:01:23.818]  Doesn't work.
[01:01:24.498 --> 01:01:27.380]  So all we have to do is protect the most vulnerable.
[01:01:27.821 --> 01:01:30.503]  No more injections ever.
[01:01:30.983 --> 01:01:35.786]  And immunization, we've got to immunize and we can do it orally.
[01:01:36.027 --> 01:01:37.768]  We're doing it at Godspeak Church.
[01:01:37.808 --> 01:01:40.430]  We're doing it at Light Dove Ministries.
[01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.551]  No more.
[01:01:41.811 --> 01:01:52.299]  That record that they fill out is in violation of the 1986 Act because it says immunization record and not one injection was ever
[01:01:52.739 --> 01:01:53.759]  An immunization.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.740]  None gave you life.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:05.544]  Plus, Dr. Michovitz, I mean, if you study the law, and this is what I do know, and I've had the top lawyers on, it doesn't cover fraud, it doesn't cover deceit, it doesn't cover fake trials.
[01:02:05.624 --> 01:02:10.446]  So they're protected quasi if they didn't commit all these crimes and lie about the definitions.
[01:02:10.466 --> 01:02:10.806]  You're right.
[01:02:10.866 --> 01:02:11.927]  So it's all blown up.
[01:02:12.387 --> 01:02:13.447]  They know it's coming down.
[01:02:13.907 --> 01:02:15.268]  And so what do you expect to happen now?
[01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:27.601]  I expect Bobby Kennedy and Trump, I expect the American people to elect Bobby Kennedy or Trump, and I really don't care which one.
[01:02:27.961 --> 01:02:40.510]  Trump can take a pen on that first day and knock down that Bayh-Dole Act and give the taxpayers back their intellectual property, which would be the good scientist and the honest scientist.
[01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:44.533]  Bobby Kennedy wrote that brilliant foreword in Plague of Corruption.
[01:02:44.873 --> 01:02:51.117]  And I thank God that one last story I didn't tell him was we saved all the samples.
[01:02:51.437 --> 01:02:54.999]  I'll be taking to General Flynn every piece of data.
[01:02:55.039 --> 01:03:03.044]  We shipped all the clones of all the healing, all the proof, all the monoclonal ibibabs that they're advertising on TV.
[01:03:03.264 --> 01:03:08.247]  We've got all of them, and we know how to use them, and we're going to give them back to the people.
[01:03:08.347 --> 01:03:11.408]  I've waited 15 years to give them back to the people.
[01:03:11.428 --> 01:03:13.490]  I'm not a scientist like you, but here's an example.
[01:03:14.431 --> 01:03:15.432]  Human growth hormone.
[01:03:15.472 --> 01:03:16.474]  I've read the literature on it.
[01:03:16.875 --> 01:03:20.722]  It's from one dead baby that they cloned and made that out of.
[01:03:20.982 --> 01:03:24.769]  So what you're explaining is that they've got this whole system.
[01:03:26.411 --> 01:03:27.712]  But we make our own.
[01:03:28.112 --> 01:03:30.334]  It's called insulin-like growth factor.
[01:03:30.735 --> 01:03:32.296]  Diabetes isn't sugar.
[01:03:32.776 --> 01:03:34.778]  It's glucose and fat metabolism.
[01:03:34.798 --> 01:03:36.499]  They took our fat out of our diet.
[01:03:36.559 --> 01:03:37.140]  Eat butter.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:38.421]  Eat real fat.
[01:03:38.661 --> 01:03:39.822]  We've got all of this.
[01:03:39.862 --> 01:03:40.983]  We've got the cures.
[01:03:41.023 --> 01:03:42.003]  We've got the proof.
[01:03:42.224 --> 01:03:44.065]  They're in freezers in this country.
[01:03:44.085 --> 01:03:44.746]  This is intriguing.
[01:03:44.766 --> 01:03:47.388]  Let me ask you this because when you're repetitive, I bring you back because you're so smart.
[01:03:47.408 --> 01:03:48.689]  I want to go to the areas we haven't covered.
[01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:51.251]  I'm not a biologist.
[01:03:51.331 --> 01:03:52.612]  I'm not like you.
[01:03:53.843 --> 01:04:02.692]  They explain that there's two sets of DNA, but they never talk about the mitochondrial DNA that's associated with the mother.
[01:04:03.533 --> 01:04:05.855]  And I know they're really trying to figure that out.
[01:04:05.915 --> 01:04:06.796]  How does that feed into this?
[01:04:06.856 --> 01:04:07.877]  Oh, they took that out!
[01:04:08.198 --> 01:04:11.341]  The mitochondrial DNA is all inherited by your mother.
[01:04:11.661 --> 01:04:14.342]  So this is the horrific crime of all this.
[01:04:14.662 --> 01:04:18.263]  They've attacked for four decades, actually since 1934.
[01:04:19.423 --> 01:04:23.004]  They've attacked the mitochondria, which you inherit from your mother.
[01:04:23.284 --> 01:04:28.586]  You asked about the heart, it's in the heart, it's in the brain, and it's in the muscles.
[01:04:28.646 --> 01:04:36.108]  So when you're fueling your muscles, you have a heart attack because you can't run that with the synthetic, creating the inflammation.
[01:04:36.408 --> 01:04:39.869]  It's like electrocution for those athletes in the sudden death.
[01:04:40.149 --> 01:04:44.973]  It's a sodium chloride channel loop for A. We can fix all of this.
[01:04:45.273 --> 01:04:46.955]  So this is the thing.
[01:04:47.415 --> 01:04:53.320]  Everybody said, yeah, it's not our DNA.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.942]  What about Henrietta Lacks?
[01:04:54.982 --> 01:04:58.465]  I'm sure they found other humans, but it's only her, a black lady.
[01:04:59.085 --> 01:05:00.826]  That died of a cancer, Eddie, in like a week.
[01:05:01.407 --> 01:05:04.849]  And then it's one white baby they aborted they found had an immortal cell on it.
[01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:05.549]  Oh, no.
[01:05:05.649 --> 01:05:06.990]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:11.313]  There are hundreds, thousands, millions of cell lines.
[01:05:11.613 --> 01:05:14.235]  My job was to create the cell lines.
[01:05:14.635 --> 01:05:17.917]  I immortalized cell lines from every kind of cancer.
[01:05:18.157 --> 01:05:20.099]  This is what they tried to say.
[01:05:20.119 --> 01:05:24.181]  So, Doctor, in closing, I'll shut up because I want you to go over this.
[01:05:24.201 --> 01:05:25.562]  Explain what an immortal cell line is.
[01:05:25.582 --> 01:05:26.543]  This is really important.
[01:05:27.409 --> 01:05:28.230]  Immortalized.
[01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:30.052]  It grows in a laboratory.
[01:05:30.192 --> 01:05:39.281]  All you have to do is add cow blood and put it in a fermentation and every single virus and every single microbe will be produced.
[01:05:39.581 --> 01:05:48.590]  Henrietta Lacks, this is, we're going back to old news when we publish that again in 2023 as if this is the only one.
[01:05:48.930 --> 01:05:50.652]  No, there's an American type
[01:05:51.432 --> 01:05:55.313]  ATCC is a tissue culture laboratory.
[01:05:55.653 --> 01:06:05.616]  Every time I made a cell line in the government over 40 years, 45 years, you have to deposit it in a repository before you publish the paper.
[01:06:05.936 --> 01:06:07.417]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[01:06:07.437 --> 01:06:10.038]  I have all 40 years.
[01:06:10.378 --> 01:06:13.359]  I have every one of these cell lines.
[01:06:13.699 --> 01:06:15.659]  I have them all in freezers.
[01:06:15.779 --> 01:06:18.020]  I gave them to the Ninth Circuit Court.
[01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:24.005]  And talk to the FBI in a $10,000 conversation with Frank Ricetti.
[01:06:24.266 --> 01:06:25.947]  Frank Ricetti is the hero.
[01:06:26.027 --> 01:06:28.009]  He saved everything.
[01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:35.856]  He wasn't a coward like Thompson that covered up this information and is safe for 20 years and then got caught.
[01:06:35.936 --> 01:06:36.777]  The movie Vax 2014.
[01:06:38.258 --> 01:06:39.339]  Look at the years.
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:40.641]  We caught them.
[01:06:41.061 --> 01:06:52.812]  Now all we have to do, love wins, is say bye-bye, put them all in federal prison for violating the 1986 Act, and go back and immunize our kids.
[01:06:53.112 --> 01:06:54.193]  Go back to God.
[01:06:54.273 --> 01:06:57.496]  We heal our land if we humble ourselves.
[01:06:58.697 --> 01:07:00.259]  That's 2 Chronicles 7, 14.
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:05.704]  If we humble ourselves, every one of us made a mistake.
[01:07:06.264 --> 01:07:06.785]  No more.
[01:07:07.025 --> 01:07:08.307]  Don't go in their stores.
[01:07:08.368 --> 01:07:08.928]  Don't buy.
[01:07:09.149 --> 01:07:10.851]  Everything is laced with poison.
[01:07:10.871 --> 01:07:13.956]  There's nothing that's food in a grocery store.
[01:07:14.257 --> 01:07:15.519]  Just humble yourselves.
[01:07:15.899 --> 01:07:16.941]  Forgive yourselves.
[01:07:21.408 --> 01:07:24.370]  The people, we will immunize you.
[01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:28.693]  We will give you back what you paid for, taxpayers.
[01:07:29.154 --> 01:07:32.676]  I will take it to all of it.
[01:07:32.816 --> 01:07:33.457]  I've waited.
[01:07:34.037 --> 01:07:41.202]  I've waited for the government to do the right thing since I was J6 kidnapped November 18, 2011.
[01:07:44.044 --> 01:07:49.566]  And we didn't yell about being, you know, we'll get J6'd again.
[01:07:49.606 --> 01:07:52.347]  If you put me in jail, can you put me in with Peter Navarro?
[01:07:52.367 --> 01:07:53.987]  Because I really want to show him all this stuff.
[01:07:54.327 --> 01:07:56.048]  Anyway, so we got a lot of time to talk.
[01:07:56.488 --> 01:07:59.329]  And we don't know how to heal it with a little urotherapy.
[01:07:59.349 --> 01:08:00.109]  Thanks, Ed Group.
[01:08:00.369 --> 01:08:08.272]  So, you know, we've got all the information and it's always been there in these corrupt institutions like vaccine court.
[01:08:09.112 --> 01:08:13.316]  And I'm going to make sure everybody sees every bit of it.
[01:08:13.596 --> 01:08:15.077]  I've got all the originals.
[01:08:15.338 --> 01:08:22.203]  The INIP on the back of this picture was the Intramural Neuroimmune Research Program in 2006.
[01:08:23.744 --> 01:08:25.566]  We got that grant in 2007.
[01:08:26.247 --> 01:08:37.536]  We created, I co-founded the Neuroimmune Disease Institute that the corrupt and criminal Whittemores, you know, cured their own daughter and let everybody die.
[01:08:37.936 --> 01:08:40.658]  We're going to everybody else.
[01:08:41.038 --> 01:08:43.700]  Long COVID was created in 1934.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.603]  Chapter 5 of the book, Plague, Kent Hechen-Lively is a hero.
[01:08:50.304 --> 01:09:00.750]  And you are a hero for showing everybody all we the people need to do is heal the victims of this hundred-year plague of corruption.
[01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:04.753]  It's an attempted coup of our bodies, a total biological warfare takeover.
[01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:05.973]  The people are ready to face the truth.
[01:09:06.294 --> 01:09:07.795]  TheRealDrJudy.com.
[01:09:07.855 --> 01:09:09.196]  TheRealDrJudy.com.
[01:09:09.756 --> 01:09:11.357]  And I've got your number.
[01:09:11.637 --> 01:09:16.321]  We should talk off air because I've seen how great Nitric Boost has done for so many people.
[01:09:16.341 --> 01:09:19.903]  And I know you guys, you told me this couple years ago, we're putting together even something more powerful.
[01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:20.223]  That's great.
[01:09:20.243 --> 01:09:20.824]  People should get it.
[01:09:20.844 --> 01:09:23.966]  I'm going to get it from my dad because it really brought him back.
[01:09:24.986 --> 01:09:28.087]  With the infestation he had, which is nitric boost.
[01:09:28.107 --> 01:09:32.208]  So I'm going to 100% believe you, I'm going to get this cardio miracle.
[01:09:32.228 --> 01:09:32.688]  Foundation.
[01:09:32.888 --> 01:09:33.808]  Living water.
[01:09:33.968 --> 01:09:34.788]  Cardio miracle.
[01:09:35.208 --> 01:09:36.129]  Cardio miracle.
[01:09:36.169 --> 01:09:37.949]  All right.
[01:09:38.509 --> 01:09:40.470]  Doctor, thank you so much.
[01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:42.070]  But listen, you hammer these points.
[01:09:42.130 --> 01:09:42.390]  I get it.
[01:09:42.610 --> 01:09:43.490]  You've got the treatments.
[01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:44.550]  You know what they're doing.
[01:09:45.111 --> 01:09:45.931]  You've got their plan.
[01:09:45.951 --> 01:09:46.991]  But they're not treatments.
[01:09:47.051 --> 01:09:47.911]  They're food.
[01:09:47.971 --> 01:09:48.931]  They're nutrify.
[01:09:48.991 --> 01:09:51.192]  It's just stop poisoning yourself, Alex.
[01:09:51.232 --> 01:09:51.672]  I understand.
[01:09:52.032 --> 01:09:56.433]  And poison is the fear porn in our brain, and the anger is just as bad.
[01:09:56.493 --> 01:10:00.474]  I'm trying to get over my own anger, and I definitely want to spend time.
[01:10:00.514 --> 01:10:02.095]  We saw the people we healed.
[01:10:02.395 --> 01:10:03.535]  We heal them with love.
[01:10:03.855 --> 01:10:04.995]  We heal them with laughter.
[01:10:05.055 --> 01:10:06.796]  We say, we got this.
[01:10:06.876 --> 01:10:07.616]  We give them hope.
[01:10:07.676 --> 01:10:09.236]  We got this, folks.
[01:10:09.576 --> 01:10:11.237]  We can heal you tomorrow.
[01:10:11.537 --> 01:10:13.477]  We've done it over and over and over again.
[01:10:13.497 --> 01:10:13.857]  I understand.
[01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:14.698]  So I'm going to call you.
[01:10:14.838 --> 01:10:15.818]  Give me a time this week to talk.
[01:10:16.338 --> 01:10:26.442]  Let's talk about this and the people need the solutions and we know it's there and that's why they tried to block all the hydroxychloroquines and all of the other things trying to give us poison.
[01:10:26.822 --> 01:10:30.803]  Brandesivir, now they've got Cuomo on TV saying, oh no, ivermectin's great.
[01:10:31.263 --> 01:10:38.406]  Well, there's stuff way beyond all of that and Joe Rogan's talking about it, Dr. Judy Mikevich, thank you so much for the time today.
[01:10:39.585 --> 01:10:40.346]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:10:40.666 --> 01:10:42.108]  I'm sorry I get so upset.
[01:10:42.448 --> 01:10:43.470]  No, no, no.
[01:10:44.150 --> 01:10:46.193]  You're hammering the solutions over and over again.
[01:10:46.553 --> 01:10:47.755]  You've got so much other knowledge.
[01:10:47.775 --> 01:10:49.537]  So I'm going to send you a bunch of my questions.
[01:10:49.637 --> 01:10:50.578]  This is a great interview, by the way.
[01:10:50.998 --> 01:10:54.683]  But sometimes you've got so much other knowledge and the history to slow down.
[01:10:55.203 --> 01:10:57.966]  We should probably do a two-hour commercial-free show where you talk about
[01:10:58.547 --> 01:10:59.267]  We're good to go.
[01:11:26.727 --> 01:11:28.608]  We're actually doing all of that.
[01:11:28.688 --> 01:11:31.729]  We're doing a book club and all I'm doing is playing our books.
[01:11:32.210 --> 01:11:35.791]  I'm playing Plague, Plague of Corruption and Ending Plague.
[01:11:35.831 --> 01:11:37.612]  We started February 21st.
[01:11:37.852 --> 01:11:40.413]  We play a chapter and then we talk live.
[01:11:40.714 --> 01:11:42.134]  It's right there on the website.
[01:11:42.174 --> 01:11:44.896]  You can see all of the first eight weeks.
[01:11:45.176 --> 01:11:48.977]  We do it Wednesday night at 5 o'clock Pacific on X Spaces.
[01:11:49.298 --> 01:11:51.198]  Dr. Judy on X. Follow us.
[01:11:51.539 --> 01:11:54.300]  Let's have some fun in a book club because you hear it.
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:59.622]  And when you hear it, yeah, you get upset, but the doctors are seeing it and they're learning.
[01:11:59.962 --> 01:12:01.163]  And that's what our books are.
[01:12:01.703 --> 01:12:05.764]  They're perspectives and testimony, and they're showing how God wins.
[01:12:05.824 --> 01:12:07.745]  It's definitely exponential.
[01:12:07.805 --> 01:12:17.169]  And the thing is, they're coming in with a UN treaty, they're planning new attacks, and the good news is they thought we'd be run over by this and brush ourselves off because we're not victims, we move on.
[01:12:17.409 --> 01:12:20.990]  We can't move on because they've got to go to prison, we've got to stop them from doing it again.
[01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:22.851]  Dr. Mikovits, thank you so much.
[01:12:25.212 --> 01:12:26.012]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:12:26.533 --> 01:12:27.633]  And you promised me dinner.
[01:12:28.413 --> 01:12:30.014]  Anytime I come to Austin, let's go.
[01:12:30.954 --> 01:12:32.095]  And meet your beautiful wife.
[01:12:32.175 --> 01:12:32.995]  I'll see you soon.
[01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:34.336]  Come here next week or the week after.
[01:12:34.376 --> 01:12:34.716]  Let's go.
[01:12:34.756 --> 01:12:35.176]  Let's do it.
[01:12:36.277 --> 01:12:36.637]  Okay.
[01:12:36.757 --> 01:12:38.377]  I'll be there June 15th for sure.
[01:12:38.617 --> 01:12:38.878]  Boom.
[01:12:39.638 --> 01:12:40.238]  We'll see you soon.
[01:12:41.759 --> 01:12:42.059]  All right.
[01:12:42.079 --> 01:12:47.661]  We're going to take a break and then shift gears into the world news, the solar flare news, the financial news.
[01:12:47.701 --> 01:12:49.302]  We've got so much to hit coming up here.
[01:12:50.677 --> 01:12:52.759]  Look, she's pissed, folks, because she should be.
[01:12:52.879 --> 01:12:57.203]  She has been there, she has seen it, she has been vindicated, and what she said is totally true.
[01:12:57.984 --> 01:13:01.708]  They hit you with a synthetic building block of every form of life.
[01:13:02.907 --> 01:13:06.568]  Sharks, monkeys, plants.
[01:13:06.868 --> 01:13:10.229]  It's a total attack on life on Earth.
[01:13:10.730 --> 01:13:15.251]  I mean, think about that for a minute and just think about how insane that is.
[01:13:15.951 --> 01:13:17.192]  But they're cutting the carbon off.
[01:13:17.572 --> 01:13:18.652]  It's like an alien attack.
[01:13:18.992 --> 01:13:21.033]  I'm not saying little green men are running it.
[01:13:21.954 --> 01:13:24.996]  You know, all I know is it's, it's like an alien attack.
[01:13:25.056 --> 01:13:27.598]  I mean, this thing, this thing is so intense.
[01:13:27.658 --> 01:13:30.479]  This thing is, I can never seem to center the camera here.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.241]  This thing is so intense.
[01:13:32.281 --> 01:13:35.563]  This thing is so absolutely insane and crazy.
[01:13:36.103 --> 01:13:41.006]  But, but, but people have to understand that that is, I'll just sit over on this side, I'll do it this way.
[01:13:41.587 --> 01:13:45.509]  This thing is so completely insane and like so real folks.
[01:13:46.129 --> 01:13:51.273]  And, and people just have to let that boil down into them and understand that.
[01:13:52.148 --> 01:13:53.308]  Because this is the reality.
[01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:54.789]  This is really going on.
[01:13:55.549 --> 01:13:57.069]  The literature is over the top.
[01:13:57.410 --> 01:14:01.191]  Miscarriages, 80 plus percent of the women in the first trimesters, miscarriages.
[01:14:01.611 --> 01:14:02.751]  It's in mainstream news now.
[01:14:02.931 --> 01:14:03.792]  I told you three years ago.
[01:14:03.812 --> 01:14:05.152]  It was in the New England Medical Journal.
[01:14:05.512 --> 01:14:07.053]  I mean, cancer off the charts.
[01:14:07.133 --> 01:14:08.233]  Death rates off the charts.
[01:14:08.613 --> 01:14:09.953]  Actuaries, 22 million dead.
[01:14:11.254 --> 01:14:16.635]  Long COVID is a, she said, nanotech infestation in your body.
[01:14:17.556 --> 01:14:21.577]  A nanotech infestation in your body, people.
[01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:24.210]  I don't think so.
[01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:47.322]  Nanobot stories where it shows congressional testimony and FDA documents.
[01:14:47.382 --> 01:14:53.684]  And I mean, it's like we are being colonized by something that literally has our bodies kill us.
[01:14:56.084 --> 01:14:57.125]  It's that simple.
[01:14:57.205 --> 01:14:59.686]  And I mean, you just, I've got four children.
[01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:00.946]  I've got a wife.
[01:15:01.026 --> 01:15:01.826]  I've got parents.
[01:15:03.747 --> 01:15:05.287]  I had friends die from this crap.
[01:15:07.668 --> 01:15:09.229]  It's just so over the top.
[01:15:10.902 --> 01:15:17.545]  You see the, I actually love the urgency and it's beyond desperation.
[01:15:17.565 --> 01:15:29.671]  It's not desperate, it's the frustration of having the solutions and knowing you're right and trying to get people to realize that I could play you from just the last week.
[01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:34.253]  More than 10 clips.
[01:15:35.618 --> 01:15:36.319]  I'm good.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.121]  And that lady is so smart.
[01:15:56.461 --> 01:15:59.062]  She just keeps hammering, we have a solution, we have a solution.
[01:15:59.402 --> 01:16:00.082]  Great, we get that.
[01:16:00.342 --> 01:16:01.903]  The public doesn't know they're in trouble yet.
[01:16:02.243 --> 01:16:02.903]  A lot of them do.
[01:16:03.404 --> 01:16:08.946]  But I first got to convince somebody they're under attack before we sit there and tell them, hey, nutrition's the way.
[01:16:09.786 --> 01:16:17.630]  And that's why they want to ban regular cows, regular food, regular farming, and they're phasing it out right now so that you don't have building blocks.
[01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:22.652]  She's explaining, it's got to have a synthetic system with fake building blocks to kill you.
[01:16:24.022 --> 01:16:25.503]  And they just gave you cyanide in the food.
[01:16:25.543 --> 01:16:28.384]  People go, oh God, people at the grocery store today and 300 people died.
[01:16:29.165 --> 01:16:31.986]  This is instead, you're all sick, you don't know what's happening.
[01:16:32.647 --> 01:16:35.088]  Everybody's different genetically, so you die slowly.
[01:16:35.328 --> 01:16:36.729]  It's called a soft kill.
[01:16:36.749 --> 01:16:37.890]  And that's in a Pentagon report.
[01:16:39.070 --> 01:16:41.732]  And people lionize the military and they say it's going to save us, folks.
[01:16:42.352 --> 01:16:44.113]  The Pentagon ran this.
[01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:47.155]  The top generals are the cult leaders in this.
[01:16:48.601 --> 01:16:49.721]  It's their job to fight an enemy.
[01:16:49.761 --> 01:16:50.641]  Well, humans are the enemy.
[01:16:50.981 --> 01:16:52.782]  So they deployed all this.
[01:16:53.222 --> 01:16:54.282]  It wasn't the Chi-Coms.
[01:16:54.302 --> 01:16:56.162]  They made it at Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
[01:16:56.382 --> 01:16:57.603]  That came out in 2015.
[01:16:57.983 --> 01:17:00.063]  This was their attack, and it's not going well.
[01:17:00.903 --> 01:17:08.524]  So as negative and as out of control all of this is, the good news is it's not going well for them.
[01:17:09.565 --> 01:17:10.925]  So that's the good news.
[01:17:10.945 --> 01:17:11.545]  That's the bad news.
[01:17:11.565 --> 01:17:14.125]  All right, we're going to play this Gregg Race report.
[01:17:18.663 --> 01:17:22.524]  I want to play that Deborah Birx clip one more time at the end of it.
[01:17:23.904 --> 01:17:27.845]  And you know, we talked so much about the X-Files piece.
[01:17:28.445 --> 01:17:31.165]  And again, folks, we'll air that again.
[01:17:32.986 --> 01:17:38.487]  I don't get up here and say Chris Carter was in the news and said, I'm the reason we made this new show.
[01:17:38.627 --> 01:17:45.428]  And I'm really to go, oh God, X-Files was about me, you know, eight years ago.
[01:17:48.365 --> 01:17:53.428]  I remember like being more enamored that Chris Carter was in the news saying, this hero's based on Alex Jones.
[01:17:53.448 --> 01:17:54.548]  I think what he says is really true.
[01:17:55.009 --> 01:17:56.449]  I'm really worried about what's happening.
[01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:59.251]  And I was more like, I was like, well, this is really cool.
[01:17:59.331 --> 01:18:02.753]  Like X-Files is about me and I'm watching it at home with my wife.
[01:18:03.873 --> 01:18:05.394]  Cause I was so naive in eight years ago.
[01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:07.175]  No, Chris Carter's all hooked in.
[01:18:07.315 --> 01:18:08.516]  Why did he put that out?
[01:18:08.616 --> 01:18:12.818]  Why did he say they're sending something in to break your DNA and make your body kill you?
[01:18:14.161 --> 01:18:17.204]  They were warning people ahead, or were they predicting programming?
[01:18:17.484 --> 01:18:17.904]  I don't know.
[01:18:17.924 --> 01:18:18.465]  I don't think.
[01:18:18.805 --> 01:18:23.369]  I mean, Carter put out a 9-11 show six months before it happened.
[01:18:24.010 --> 01:18:25.411]  People think I predicted 9-11?
[01:18:25.851 --> 01:18:27.233]  I didn't even see the lone gunman.
[01:18:27.253 --> 01:18:28.434]  I didn't watch X-Files back then.
[01:18:31.024 --> 01:18:36.068]  So it's a big deal because you heard Mikovits saying, this is what this is.
[01:18:36.529 --> 01:18:38.250]  She was nodding her head during this four minute clip.
[01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:44.595]  So here's Gregory's report, then Deborah Burke's, then we're going to do a couple hours after this folks on everything.
[01:18:44.675 --> 01:18:45.836]  It's going to be so key.
[01:18:46.537 --> 01:18:48.178]  Clearly the financial collapse is already here.
[01:18:48.198 --> 01:18:51.081]  They're just not telling the public as they organize things to get ready.
[01:18:51.321 --> 01:18:52.882]  The good news is we're ahead of the curve.
[01:18:53.142 --> 01:18:53.943]  We know what's going on.
[01:18:54.183 --> 01:18:55.304]  So there's those two reports.
[01:18:55.524 --> 01:18:57.046]  We'll come right back with special guests in studio.
[01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:09.677]  For decades, Ray Kurzweil has been an unofficial spokesman for the transhumanist movement.
[01:19:10.118 --> 01:19:18.810]  And in 2008, he said that humans would become infused with nanorobots, which would vastly improve the human body.
[01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:19.771]  If you go out
[01:19:20.652 --> 01:19:21.192]  See you next time.
[01:19:39.967 --> 01:19:45.348]  As we knew them from the 19th century, which were much lesser than humans, and machines today are still lesser than humans.
[01:19:45.688 --> 01:19:55.411]  I'm talking about a new type of machine that's actually greater, more subtle, more supple, more intelligent, more creative, more beautiful than humans.
[01:19:55.591 --> 01:20:04.353]  In 2010, he interviewed Robert Freitas on the future of nanotechnology, who said that nanorobots could cure aging and death.
[01:20:04.773 --> 01:20:10.094]  Medical nanorobots really have the potential to extend human life more or less indefinitely.
[01:20:10.114 --> 01:20:13.995]  So what's your view about the role of death and do we need death?
[01:20:14.795 --> 01:20:16.636]  Death is something that is an end.
[01:20:17.236 --> 01:20:17.996]  It's an end to life.
[01:20:18.596 --> 01:20:19.596]  It's an end to progress.
[01:20:19.736 --> 01:20:20.577]  It's an end to thoughts.
[01:20:21.577 --> 01:20:22.997]  It's something to be cured.
[01:20:24.197 --> 01:20:26.518]  Aging is a disease.
[01:20:27.498 --> 01:20:28.578]  It's a curable disease.
[01:20:29.719 --> 01:20:30.439]  Nanomedicine
[01:20:32.108 --> 01:20:33.549]  is the cure for that disease.
[01:20:33.989 --> 01:20:42.815]  He said that this technology is expected to be deployed by 2020 and that laws will be in place to protect the public from its misuse.
[01:20:43.176 --> 01:20:52.342]  I expect that by the time nanorobots are deployed, which will be sometime perhaps in the 2020s or the 2030s, we will have a whole set of laws in place, regulations.
[01:20:52.862 --> 01:20:54.663]  There will be things you can and cannot do.
[01:20:55.124 --> 01:20:56.725]  The laws were never put in place.
[01:20:57.105 --> 01:21:02.509]  But the technology was patented and deployed to billions of people without their knowledge in 2020.
[01:21:03.329 --> 01:21:11.595]  We know this because several independent labs have confirmed the presence of this nanotechnology in the COVID vaccines.
[01:21:12.115 --> 01:21:14.877]  And Bill Gates recently admitted to this as well.
[01:21:15.177 --> 01:21:20.524]  Making the mRNA is really easy and really cheap and that's the magic of this thing.
[01:21:21.104 --> 01:21:26.531]  But there's no doubt in the next five years we can, you know, we just need to mess around.
[01:21:26.611 --> 01:21:30.716]  There's a lot of lipid nanoparticles and some are very self-assembly.
[01:21:31.596 --> 01:21:37.581]  Self-assembly and self-replication seem to be the same technology when it comes to nanorobots.
[01:21:37.941 --> 01:21:43.045]  And this was considered to be the greatest danger involved with the use of this technology.
[01:21:43.325 --> 01:21:45.126]  Self-replication causes disease.
[01:21:46.007 --> 01:21:52.331]  Nanorobots are inherently much stronger than biological systems being built of diamondoids.
[01:21:52.372 --> 01:22:00.157]  So if they self-replicate, that disease, quote-unquote, could be even a tougher problem than biological disease.
[01:22:01.318 --> 01:22:07.122]  So, first of all, what's the feasibility of self-replication in the nanotechnology world?
[01:22:07.642 --> 01:22:12.525]  As a general principle, you do not want to put self-replicating nanorobots inside the human body.
[01:22:13.286 --> 01:22:19.449]  I suppose not everybody agrees with me on that, but that is the way I think that we can best guarantee safety.
[01:22:20.290 --> 01:22:29.716]  If the nanorobots are able to replicate inside the human body, that means they are using some component of the human body as food, and we don't want them to be doing that.
[01:22:30.676 --> 01:22:49.455]  In his 1986 book, Engines of Creation, Kim Eric Drexler wrote about what he termed the Grey Goo Scenario, a hypothetical catastrophic event caused by out-of-control, self-replicating nanotechnology which consumes the biomass of the host.
[01:22:50.016 --> 01:22:53.059]  And this is exactly what independent researchers are finding.
[01:22:54.341 --> 01:22:58.867]  It explains the large so-called blood clots being found in the dead.
[01:22:59.468 --> 01:23:00.209]  And it's spreading.
[01:23:00.630 --> 01:23:04.535]  Evidence shows that the vaxxed are shedding this to the unvaxxed.
[01:23:05.016 --> 01:23:10.844]  How do we prevent a terrorist or someone who's bent on destruction from creating
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:12.361]  Sure.
[01:23:33.084 --> 01:23:33.944]  That type of event.
[01:23:34.444 --> 01:23:39.465]  But the event is worldwide, and there is no agency set up to put out this fire.
[01:23:40.106 --> 01:23:49.928]  Our governments are not even discussing the problem, and the perpetrators are planning a second round of nanobot deployment with another fake pandemic.
[01:23:50.868 --> 01:23:55.689]  If we the people cannot unite and stand together now, then what exactly are we?
[01:23:56.769 --> 01:23:59.350]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:21.522]  The reason the comparison to HIV is important is because HIV was also asymptomatic.
[01:24:21.942 --> 01:24:28.684]  I mean, you couldn't see the virus through symptoms because people were infected for 7, 8, 9 years before they developed symptoms.
[01:24:29.404 --> 01:24:38.206]  But HIV quietly destroyed our immune system and we learned a lot about immunology from HIV and it's changed completely our cancer therapy.
[01:24:38.806 --> 01:24:54.233]  We're learning now about mitochondria and viral impact and brain fog and the changes in our neurons and the cells that nourish our neurons that really allow us to think and move.
[01:24:54.513 --> 01:24:57.574]  And we're learning that because what a Blancobit has done.
[01:24:57.654 --> 01:25:00.816]  And so there's two sides of this coin every time.
[01:25:01.256 --> 01:25:02.757]  There's a lot of destruction.
[01:25:03.277 --> 01:25:05.518]  That mild and moderate COVID can do.
[01:25:05.658 --> 01:25:09.640]  That is on scene, just like HIV was destroying our immune system.
[01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:15.203]  But what came out of that is brilliant science that changed how we treated HIV.
[01:25:15.223 --> 01:25:22.407]  And if you're diagnosed today, you can live a very normal lifespan and people not only survive, but thrive.
[01:25:22.547 --> 01:25:30.551]  We need to get to the place where people with long COVID, we've done the research so that people with long COVID can not only survive, but thrive.
[01:25:31.491 --> 01:25:33.552]  Tad O'Malley has been making claims.
[01:25:34.272 --> 01:25:34.993]  Claims about what?
[01:25:36.514 --> 01:25:40.936]  You and everyone you know has a piece of DNA in your genome put there without your knowing it.
[01:25:41.056 --> 01:25:41.776]  Put there by whom?
[01:25:42.317 --> 01:25:43.557]  Well, that's the question of the day.
[01:25:44.518 --> 01:25:45.638]  This is an internet lunatic.
[01:25:45.658 --> 01:25:46.979]  You're not saying you believe him.
[01:25:47.139 --> 01:25:48.420]  Hold on, Agent Einstein.
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:49.560]  You're talking to a scientist.
[01:25:50.081 --> 01:25:51.301]  Forgive me, Assistant Director.
[01:25:51.361 --> 01:25:54.823]  It may sound insensitive, but the suggestion is pure science fiction.
[01:25:54.963 --> 01:26:00.246]  What I'm saying, Agent Einstein, is that the facts as I understand them cannot be discounted out of hand.
[01:26:02.006 --> 01:26:05.148]  No one has the right or the ability to tamper with your DNA.
[01:26:06.969 --> 01:26:08.230]  Unless we gave them that ability.
[01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:17.836]  You say they're tampering with our DNA, that they're able to shut down our immune systems by the addition of something to our DNA.
[01:26:18.057 --> 01:26:19.638]  Yes, but I don't know how exactly.
[01:26:20.038 --> 01:26:21.019]  Or how it's being triggered.
[01:26:21.579 --> 01:26:22.439]  I don't know that either.
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:24.461]  Or why it's happening now.
[01:26:26.306 --> 01:26:27.687]  What can we possibly do?
[01:26:27.847 --> 01:26:28.907]  We need to act quickly.
[01:26:29.367 --> 01:26:30.488]  You were right about that.
[01:26:30.568 --> 01:26:32.068]  Well, I was wrong about the science.
[01:26:32.769 --> 01:26:34.129]  I was wrong about what's causing it.
[01:26:34.169 --> 01:26:35.030]  Dead wrong, in fact.
[01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:39.111]  But it's clearly a widespread failure of our immune system.
[01:26:39.372 --> 01:26:40.372]  Through gene tampering.
[01:26:40.572 --> 01:26:43.993]  A virus within a virus that was put there through the smallpox vaccine.
[01:26:44.053 --> 01:26:46.114]  It's what these men are calling the Spartan virus.
[01:26:47.435 --> 01:26:48.415]  We have to figure this out.
[01:26:49.516 --> 01:26:50.716]  What's wrong with the science?
[01:26:52.017 --> 01:26:52.237]  Okay.
[01:26:53.697 --> 01:26:57.538]  The Spartan virus removes the adenosine deaminase gene from your DNA.
[01:26:57.558 --> 01:27:01.440]  Remove the ADA gene and your immune system will simply vanish.
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:03.201]  Yeah, but I'm not getting sick.
[01:27:04.021 --> 01:27:05.181]  It's only a matter of time.
[01:27:06.182 --> 01:27:06.462]  Okay.
[01:27:07.182 --> 01:27:07.942]  So how does it work?
[01:27:08.983 --> 01:27:11.103]  How does the virus remove the ADA gene?
[01:27:11.404 --> 01:27:12.744]  A process called CRISPR-Cas9.
[01:27:12.824 --> 01:27:13.804]  CRISPR-Cas9.
[01:27:14.865 --> 01:27:18.006]  RNA and a protein cutting genes at exact locations.
[01:27:18.126 --> 01:27:18.626]  Exactly.
[01:27:18.926 --> 01:27:20.607]  But in this instance used as a weapon.
[01:27:22.228 --> 01:27:23.008]  The ultimate weapon.
[01:27:24.321 --> 01:27:26.342]  The ability to depopulate the planet.
[01:27:27.303 --> 01:27:28.904]  To kill everyone but the chosen.
[01:27:29.124 --> 01:27:30.705]  By tampering with their DNA.
[01:27:31.326 --> 01:27:32.286]  Through gene editing.
[01:27:32.366 --> 01:27:34.087]  Why do such a thing and lie about it?
[01:27:34.107 --> 01:27:35.168]  Our own government.
[01:27:35.268 --> 01:27:38.170]  Your own government lies as a matter of course, as a matter of policy.
[01:27:38.230 --> 01:27:41.732]  The Tuskegee experiments on black men in the 30s, Henrietta Lacks.
[01:27:42.993 --> 01:27:43.974]  What are they trying to do?
[01:27:44.574 --> 01:27:45.475]  That's the missing piece.
[01:27:45.856 --> 01:27:54.487]  But it's not hard to imagine a government hiding, hoarding technology for 70 years at the expense of human life and the future of the planet.
[01:27:55.544 --> 01:27:59.886]  Driven not only by corporate greed, but a darker objective.
[01:28:00.426 --> 01:28:01.787]  The takeover of America.
[01:28:02.447 --> 01:28:08.631]  And then the world itself, by any means necessary, however violent, or cruel, or efficient.
[01:28:09.571 --> 01:28:18.736]  By severe drought, brought on by weather wars, conducted secretly using aerial contaminants and high-altitude electromagnetic waves, in a state of perpetual war.
[01:28:19.836 --> 01:28:25.499]  To create problem reaction solution scenarios to distract, enrage, and enslave American citizens at home.
[01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:33.203]  With tools like the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act, which abridge the Constitution in the name of national security.
[01:28:34.244 --> 01:28:37.445]  The militarization of police forces in cities across the U.S.
[01:28:37.745 --> 01:28:42.308]  The building of prison camps by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with no stated purpose.
[01:28:42.948 --> 01:28:53.637]  The corporate takeover of food and agriculture, pharmaceuticals and healthcare, even the military in clandestine agendas to fatten, dull, sicken and control a populace already consumed by consumerism.
[01:28:53.978 --> 01:28:55.639]  And I encourage you all to go shopping more.
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:01.044]  A government that taps your phone, collects your data and monitors your whereabouts with impunity.
[01:29:01.784 --> 01:29:04.907]  A government preparing to use that data against you when it strikes.
[01:29:05.928 --> 01:29:07.269]  And the final takeover begins.
[01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:09.451]  The takeover of America.
[01:29:10.029 --> 01:29:15.362]  By a well-oiled and well-armed multinational group of elites that will cull, kill, and subjugate.
[01:29:16.245 --> 01:29:17.528]  Happening as we sit here.
[01:29:18.214 --> 01:29:19.375]  It's happening all around us.
[01:29:19.955 --> 01:29:21.277]  The other shoe waiting to drop.
[01:29:21.677 --> 01:29:22.938]  It'll probably start on a Friday.
[01:29:23.518 --> 01:29:28.422]  The banks will announce a security action necessitating their computers to go offline all weekend.
[01:29:28.822 --> 01:29:30.083]  Digital money will disappear.
[01:29:30.103 --> 01:29:31.645]  They can just steal your money?
[01:29:31.925 --> 01:29:36.529]  Followed by the detonation of strategic electromagnetic pulse bombs to knock out major grids.
[01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:39.871]  What will seem like an attack on America by terrorists or Russia.
[01:29:39.891 --> 01:29:41.192]  An invasion of the US.
[01:29:41.773 --> 01:29:43.314]  The Russians tried it in 47.
[01:29:43.914 --> 01:29:45.376]  All I do is research.
[01:29:46.351 --> 01:29:47.152]  Research Trends.
[01:30:09.472 --> 01:30:13.233]  And so then I had Dr. Judy Mickiewicz, who's such a renowned scientist and a whistleblower.
[01:30:13.513 --> 01:30:14.674]  She said, I love your formula.
[01:30:14.694 --> 01:30:15.574]  It's one of the best out there.
[01:30:16.134 --> 01:30:19.035]  And so this product, Nitric Boost, became a bestseller.
[01:30:19.495 --> 01:30:23.096]  Well, we decided to soup it up and make it even stronger.
[01:30:23.756 --> 01:30:25.937]  So it's the original formula, just a little bit stronger.
[01:30:26.497 --> 01:30:30.398]  Now Nitric Boost is available at InfoWardStore.com.
[01:30:30.798 --> 01:30:32.779]  Because the problem was, the supplier we had,
[01:30:33.379 --> 01:30:36.120]  Couldn't supply enough, we were selling out very, very quickly.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:42.322]  But now we've got a big supply of Nitric Boost in stock, ready to ship at MFULWARESTORE.COM.
[01:30:42.683 --> 01:30:52.026]  And when I talk about vasodilation and the nitric oxide is a potent vasco-dilator, then it can help relax and widen blood vessels.
[01:30:52.386 --> 01:30:57.108]  This can lead to increased blood flow and improve circulation, which is critical to various body functions.
[01:30:57.608 --> 01:30:59.589]  So, ladies and gentlemen, it funds the MFULWAR.
[01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:01.410]  It's an amazing product.
[01:31:01.730 --> 01:31:11.893]  So we have the new and improved, super powerful Nitric Boost back in stock, ready to ship for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:12.214 --> 01:31:13.214]  This is a true win-win.
[01:31:13.634 --> 01:31:18.616]  This has the very same effect as some of the male enhancement things out there, but totally naturally.
[01:31:19.096 --> 01:31:23.618]  This does it in a natural way, and not that I need those products, but I've tried them.
[01:31:23.678 --> 01:31:24.458]  I've been to the doctor.
[01:31:24.758 --> 01:31:28.920]  They give you a prescription of it, and I've tried the top brands, the two top brands.
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:31.601]  And I'm not even trying to say that's what this is.
[01:31:31.961 --> 01:31:32.802]  That's off-label.
[01:31:32.842 --> 01:31:34.023]  That's not what this is even for.
[01:31:34.303 --> 01:31:35.143]  This is a supplement.
[01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:39.105]  But it is incredible what it does for your body.
[01:31:39.426 --> 01:31:43.768]  So get this amazing product now in stock, ready to ship.
[01:31:44.108 --> 01:31:48.511]  Nitric Boost today at InfoWarStore.com for 40% off.
[01:31:48.791 --> 01:31:50.031]  You fund the InfoWar.
[01:31:50.312 --> 01:31:51.432]  It's so good for your body.
[01:31:51.852 --> 01:31:52.613]  Get it while you can.
[01:31:53.173 --> 01:31:54.994]  Well, nitric oxide is a key.
[01:31:55.074 --> 01:31:57.114]  It's made by our own bodies again.
[01:31:57.535 --> 01:32:01.736]  It's made by L-citrulline and L-arginine, the amino acids.
[01:32:02.056 --> 01:32:02.976]  So we're fed.
[01:32:03.036 --> 01:32:05.337]  You can get it from beet powder and other things.
[01:32:05.457 --> 01:32:07.698]  The nitric oxide relaxes
[01:32:08.078 --> 01:32:11.259]  The endothelium, the vasculature, it relaxes the vein.
[01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:13.339]  It's a natural blood pressure.
[01:32:13.379 --> 01:32:14.879]  In fact, I use the two.
[01:32:14.999 --> 01:32:17.500]  Your Info Wars, I keep that on my shelf.
[01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:22.061]  And I feed myself the Cardio Miracle, which is straight food.
[01:32:22.421 --> 01:32:24.281]  It's a different formulation than that one.
[01:32:24.321 --> 01:32:26.742]  And the two together are a one-two punch.
[01:32:26.782 --> 01:32:31.183]  So you get in your food the ability to make what you need and no more.
[01:32:31.363 --> 01:32:32.403]  You've looked at our formula.
[01:32:32.443 --> 01:32:32.903]  You like it?
[01:32:34.005 --> 01:32:34.826]  I did, and I do.
[01:32:35.146 --> 01:32:35.407]  Yes.
[01:32:36.448 --> 01:32:37.589]  I'm not a scientist like you.
[01:32:37.609 --> 01:32:39.991]  What do these compounds do, creating nitrous oxide?
[01:32:40.011 --> 01:32:40.572]  What does it do?
[01:32:41.072 --> 01:32:45.697]  It relaxes the vasculature, so the clot will go through and not restrict.
[01:32:46.037 --> 01:32:51.583]  It allows it to relax, it lowers the blood pressure, has the toxic
[01:32:52.103 --> 01:32:53.804]  Yeah, why is it particularly the athletes?
[01:33:14.432 --> 01:33:28.197]  They're constricted, they're working so that the blood flows and it doesn't flow, which is why your nitric oxide product, that new product, I hope you'll show it, because that's a very important thing to have for acute events.
[01:33:28.277 --> 01:33:34.720]  It dissolves under the tongue, gives you an instant relaxing of your endothelium, your vasculature.
[01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:39.901]  So get Nitric Boost today at infowarstore.com for 40% off.
[01:33:40.302 --> 01:33:41.002]  Get it while you can.
[01:33:46.207 --> 01:33:51.991]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:33:56.874 --> 01:33:57.775]  Here's the progression.
[01:33:59.346 --> 01:34:12.871]  Bondage to spiritual faith, spiritual faith to great courage, courage to liberty, liberty to abundance, abundance to selfishness, where you just start collecting things for you and you stop giving it away, and then selfishness to apathy.
[01:34:13.391 --> 01:34:19.293]  Once your wallets get really thick and fat and you're just kind of smooth sailing through life, you get apathetic.
[01:34:19.353 --> 01:34:20.814]  What happens when you get apathetic?
[01:34:20.834 --> 01:34:21.754]  You stop caring.
[01:34:22.154 --> 01:34:23.315]  You stop voting.
[01:34:23.395 --> 01:34:26.156]  You stop listening to the things that are important because
[01:34:26.676 --> 01:34:28.097]  Your wallets are fat.
[01:34:28.218 --> 01:34:30.019]  You're stagnant.
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:40.069]  And then that apathy though, when in a period of apathy, you go back into dependence because you stopped caring and people got voted in that shouldn't have been voted in.
[01:34:40.489 --> 01:34:43.652]  And then that dependence leads back into bondage.
[01:34:44.073 --> 01:34:48.437]  And so in this cycle, where would you say that America is?
[01:34:48.657 --> 01:34:49.698]  Going into bondage.
[01:34:49.918 --> 01:34:52.040]  We're in dependence back into bondage.
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:53.781]  We're at the last stage.
[01:34:54.281 --> 01:34:55.742]  So we go back into bondage.
[01:34:56.003 --> 01:35:00.346]  I think central bank digital currency is the financial form of bondage.
[01:35:01.307 --> 01:35:02.948]  You're going to have political bondage.
[01:35:02.968 --> 01:35:05.490]  You're going to have all of these things that you can't do this.
[01:35:05.530 --> 01:35:06.370]  You can't travel.
[01:35:06.731 --> 01:35:09.233]  We already saw the test of that with with COVID.
[01:35:09.873 --> 01:35:26.322]  You know, and everything that Dr. Judy was talking about before me on the show, and it's like... Oh, Davos admits, and they were at Davos, the WF last week, saying, we use COVID as training wheels for the COVID lockdowns and total control, and Germany's going to ban cars on the weekend this summer.
[01:35:26.702 --> 01:35:27.022]  Now?
[01:35:27.382 --> 01:35:27.542]  Yeah.
[01:35:27.702 --> 01:35:29.623]  I mean, it's all going down, folks.
[01:35:32.585 --> 01:35:38.288]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:35:44.853 --> 01:36:04.687]  All right, I had a two and a half hour meeting with our next guest last night over some delicious Mexican food, and when he makes a lot of these predictions, it's kind of what with me, I'm saying it's not a prediction, I have the intel, I have the sources, they're not really predictions, but he, there's a lot of reasons he can't tell you everything, I'm gonna leave it at that, okay?
[01:36:06.088 --> 01:36:09.711]  But Dr. Kirk Elliott is
[01:36:11.069 --> 01:36:14.772]  You're here to talk about finances, the government, the economy, the world.
[01:36:15.893 --> 01:36:17.254]  But he's a big fish in all this.
[01:36:17.274 --> 01:36:19.496]  He doesn't toot his horn for a lot of reasons.
[01:36:20.457 --> 01:36:31.767]  But he was giving me intel last night, and then obviously we were arguing whether he should even release this information because, let's just be completely honest, they'll come after him.
[01:36:31.787 --> 01:36:34.329]  But they also know this is coming out, so in a way we've got to.
[01:36:34.369 --> 01:36:38.733]  So whether it's today or whether it's in a month or whatever, there's big stuff happening.
[01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:39.920]  There is.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:46.543]  I think we're on the precipice, Alex, of kind of like tectonic changes in the economy.
[01:36:46.903 --> 01:37:01.150]  As banks continue to fail, as what we've talked about numerous times, this movement towards central bank digital currency, you've got people who are, for good reason, wanting to go into tangible assets like gold and silver.
[01:37:01.470 --> 01:37:05.112]  And there's a whole separate, the whole supply chain being attacked and robbed.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:05.900]  Yes.
[01:37:06.521 --> 01:37:06.902]  Absolutely.
[01:37:06.922 --> 01:37:10.428]  And some of the numbers we're going to go over today will absolutely blow your mind.
[01:37:10.468 --> 01:37:16.517]  I mean, folks, crime is on purpose as they defund the police and will prosecute in over a thousand jurisdictions.
[01:37:16.598 --> 01:37:17.579]  It is bunker town.
[01:37:18.751 --> 01:37:37.964]  It is, and so as this move towards people seeking truth, wanting something that's real, wanting something that's tangible, losing faith and confidence in the system, the system being the government, the system being banks, everything that we've held true and stable since, I don't know,
[01:37:38.584 --> 01:37:46.567]  The 1940s, you know, when the dollar became the world's reserve currency, I think all of that is about to change.
[01:37:46.667 --> 01:37:57.691]  And as gold and silver continue to move up in value, I think, Alex, here's... You say I make predictions, you make predictions, but really it's based on just reality and what we see.
[01:37:57.711 --> 01:37:58.871]  The dominoes are already falling.
[01:37:59.031 --> 01:38:02.373]  Yeah, we can actually... It's not a prediction that if dominoes are falling, the next domino is going to fall.
[01:38:02.813 --> 01:38:03.333]  It's a fact.
[01:38:03.913 --> 01:38:04.393]  It's a fact.
[01:38:04.433 --> 01:38:05.594]  Or like if you threw a punch at me...
[01:38:06.394 --> 01:38:08.435]  I mean, there's no doubt it's going to land, it's going to hurt.
[01:38:08.455 --> 01:38:09.655]  I mean, the punch is thrown.
[01:38:09.916 --> 01:38:10.876]  Yeah.
[01:38:11.096 --> 01:38:14.798]  So who is at risk when Precious Metals goes up?
[01:38:15.618 --> 01:38:17.799]  I think it's the big brokerage houses.
[01:38:17.839 --> 01:38:18.819]  It's the big banks.
[01:38:19.099 --> 01:38:22.921]  It's an attack against paper money.
[01:38:22.981 --> 01:38:26.442]  It's an attack against stocks, bonds, mutual funds, all of that.
[01:38:27.043 --> 01:38:33.285]  So here's where I think we're probably headed in the near to medium future.
[01:38:33.345 --> 01:38:34.526]  And you predicted six months ago.
[01:38:35.627 --> 01:38:41.870]  That would start regional bank failures in March and April, and now it's begun, but it's barely getting any attention.
[01:38:42.610 --> 01:38:44.091]  Notice what happened a few years ago, it was huge.
[01:38:44.731 --> 01:38:47.792]  Now, the fact that it's so quiet, crickets, woo!
[01:38:48.212 --> 01:38:57.356]  Yeah, I mean, the bank that failed in Philly, Republic First Bank, just two weeks ago, there was $3.3 billion that evaporated that wasn't insured.
[01:38:57.896 --> 01:38:59.056]  Why isn't that getting news?
[01:38:59.096 --> 01:39:00.537]  I mean, that's a big bank.
[01:39:00.557 --> 01:39:00.997]  Translate.
[01:39:01.037 --> 01:39:01.857]  People didn't get their money.
[01:39:02.097 --> 01:39:07.799]  They didn't get their money because FDIC covered $667 million.
[01:39:08.239 --> 01:39:11.380]  That's everybody that has zero to $250,000 in their banks.
[01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:14.581]  But that bank had $4 billion in deposits.
[01:39:15.041 --> 01:39:16.621]  So I'm just doing simple math.
[01:39:16.682 --> 01:39:17.962]  It's like, OK, what's $4 billion minus $667 million?
[01:39:17.982 --> 01:39:18.422]  That's $3.3 billion.
[01:39:18.442 --> 01:39:18.742]  Where did it go?
[01:39:22.083 --> 01:39:23.345]  It's just gone, Alex.
[01:39:23.385 --> 01:39:28.770]  So as people start to lose faith and confidence in the system, they are going into precious metals.
[01:39:28.810 --> 01:39:35.677]  This is an attack against the monetary system as we know it, banking as we know it, hedge funds, all of that.
[01:39:35.737 --> 01:39:37.900]  And so here's what I think is coming.
[01:39:40.121 --> 01:39:54.666]  Regulators around the country are going to start attacking the precious metals industry and attacking specifically those companies that target seniors, that overcharge for their metals.
[01:39:55.627 --> 01:39:59.490]  Because they want to try to pretend to protect people.
[01:39:59.971 --> 01:40:03.033]  But I think that safety is of utmost concern.
[01:40:03.073 --> 01:40:10.860]  So when you invest in precious metals, you should always go into something that has a market, a built-in market, which would be bullion.
[01:40:11.361 --> 01:40:12.942]  It's used for manufacturing.
[01:40:13.443 --> 01:40:16.285]  It's Sony, Samsung, Tesla, LG.
[01:40:16.986 --> 01:40:21.791]  The defense industry, which we're going to go over today, there's massive demand there.
[01:40:22.291 --> 01:40:32.061]  It's a built-in market, which is easy, but a lot of times you get overpriced stuff that goes into the hands of people and you get shady sales techniques.
[01:40:32.601 --> 01:40:36.746]  You know, overcharge, but those firms have to make a market for that.
[01:40:36.846 --> 01:40:47.679]  So when you own them and you say, OK, it's time for me to sell and they go back and say, OK, we have to call some other unsuspecting clients and say, hey, we've got a deal for you.
[01:40:47.719 --> 01:40:51.304]  We've got this inventory that just came in, but it's going to be gone pretty short order.
[01:40:51.884 --> 01:41:01.153]  Those kind of tactics I think are going to be clamped down on and ultimately those people have delivery of those things at home, Alex.
[01:41:01.233 --> 01:41:14.025]  And so what else I see coming is like, I don't know how else to say it, but like criminal crime syndicates almost, where they know what's being shipped.
[01:41:14.645 --> 01:41:23.593]  They know who's getting what, because there's probably going to be people on the inside of big shippers around the country, and there's going to be outright theft.
[01:41:23.673 --> 01:41:28.156]  So I think you're going to see... Okay, well you're going there now, and I already knew about this from other sources.
[01:41:28.797 --> 01:41:30.518]  It's not probably going to, it's going on.
[01:41:30.979 --> 01:41:32.640]  So again, it's not like you just started saying this.
[01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:36.163]  I've been in gold and silver for 30 years, or 28 since I got sponsors.
[01:41:37.344 --> 01:41:40.507]  I have, this is key folks, this is about me jumping in to make a point because I'm smart.
[01:41:41.545 --> 01:41:52.553]  I've had a gold and silver sponsor for 10 years because I could not find one that was moral and good and wasn't going to sell people collectible stuff that they're going to have a big trouble getting if they're overcharged on.
[01:41:53.254 --> 01:41:58.197]  So all the companies that came to me, and a few of them I signed deals with, and then they would immediately break the deal.
[01:41:58.217 --> 01:42:04.562]  That's why we'd have a gold sponsor for a week and be gone, because I would call and check myself and say, I want silver and gold bullion.
[01:42:04.582 --> 01:42:10.286]  And they'd say, oh, well, that's great, but we actually need this shipwrecked gold and this thing over here is the best thing ever.
[01:42:11.207 --> 01:42:18.214]  The point is the system is going to use that with regulators, they already are behind the scenes, to go after those groups to then try to roll the whole thing up.
[01:42:18.254 --> 01:42:23.398]  So people ask you when you were on about a couple weeks ago, will they do like 1933 gold confiscation?
[01:42:23.438 --> 01:42:27.242]  Well no, that was the main currency then and so they made you turn your gold in for the paper.
[01:42:27.262 --> 01:42:27.963]  That's totally different.
[01:42:28.003 --> 01:42:36.811]  When you've got like a point and a half or maybe two percent owning gold and silver, they admit they're not going to try to get the physical stuff from you, they're going to try to destroy the market
[01:42:37.071 --> 01:42:37.551]  We're good to go.
[01:43:01.389 --> 01:43:01.990]  A hundred percent.
[01:43:02.050 --> 01:43:03.712]  I couldn't have said it better myself.
[01:43:03.772 --> 01:43:16.204]  And so as years, decades ago, Alex, when, when I was actually envisioning how my firm was going to look, you know, I think I saw this coming even, even back then, which is.
[01:43:16.244 --> 01:43:17.225]  It's 25, 30 years ago.
[01:43:17.245 --> 01:43:18.686]  You were already a top broker at a big company.
[01:43:19.446 --> 01:43:30.109]  Yeah, I mean I've been doing this for a really long time, but here's where I try to connect the dots like you do, and it's like, okay, what is it that people are always going to need?
[01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:38.351]  They're going to need stability, they're going to need value, and I would encourage everybody to start redefining how you measure your wealth.
[01:43:38.471 --> 01:43:43.712]  Don't measure it in terms of paper dollars, because that erodes with inflation and everything that we're seeing.
[01:43:44.432 --> 01:43:49.616]  Start measuring your wealth in terms of how many ounces of tangible assets do you control.
[01:43:49.756 --> 01:43:51.557]  And is it in your backyard?
[01:43:51.617 --> 01:43:53.399]  I mean, do you put your fingers on it?
[01:43:53.939 --> 01:43:57.362]  Because digital ain't jack crap now, and it's going to be nothing in the future.
[01:43:57.602 --> 01:43:59.543]  Yeah, it is going to be nothing.
[01:43:59.563 --> 01:44:03.026]  And if you have something that's digital, they're going to know everything about you.
[01:44:03.046 --> 01:44:04.627]  They're going to know your spending habits.
[01:44:04.647 --> 01:44:07.229]  They're going to know your patterns, your preferences.
[01:44:07.709 --> 01:44:12.475]  All of that, Alex, and if it's digital, I don't care what people say about privacy.
[01:44:12.915 --> 01:44:14.838]  With the flip of a switch, they can cut you off.
[01:44:14.918 --> 01:44:23.448]  For example, look at the people in Russia who had Bitcoin, for example, and they had their Bitcoin owned through Coinbase.
[01:44:23.948 --> 01:44:32.091]  Well, when Russia-Ukraine conflict started, Coinbase basically determined the IP addresses of those in Russia and said, okay, you're not going to be able to access your funds.
[01:44:32.432 --> 01:44:40.835]  They cut off an entire people group because of... Including people that had Russian surnames who were even citizens in the West, in cases.
[01:44:41.135 --> 01:44:43.117]  Well, it's just bonkers!
[01:44:43.297 --> 01:44:51.163]  And so, so here, say, okay, well that's okay, we're at war with Russia and Putin's evil and whatever people think, but take it one step further.
[01:44:51.543 --> 01:44:53.265]  What if you're a Christian and they don't like it?
[01:44:53.345 --> 01:44:57.748]  What if you're a conservative and non-globalist and they don't like that position?
[01:44:57.768 --> 01:44:58.749]  That's the Social Credits Court!
[01:44:58.769 --> 01:44:59.370]  That should have been a plan!
[01:44:59.793 --> 01:45:00.773]  That is the plan.
[01:45:00.893 --> 01:45:02.313]  In their own words, that's the plan.
[01:45:02.334 --> 01:45:04.994]  It's like you say, we're not predicting, we're telling you what's already happening.
[01:45:05.254 --> 01:45:05.474]  Yeah.
[01:45:06.114 --> 01:45:08.815]  And I hate to take the thunder away from us, but you do that too.
[01:45:08.875 --> 01:45:09.195]  It's true.
[01:45:09.535 --> 01:45:11.555]  It's not Dr. Kirk Elliott or Alex Jones.
[01:45:11.595 --> 01:45:12.976]  This is already happening.
[01:45:13.516 --> 01:45:13.716]  Yeah.
[01:45:14.116 --> 01:45:15.836]  We're not making predictions.
[01:45:15.896 --> 01:45:22.337]  We're connecting dots and showing where this trend is headed if we don't do something about it.
[01:45:22.878 --> 01:45:25.138]  So, you know, look at
[01:45:26.479 --> 01:45:27.960]  We're good to go.
[01:45:43.345 --> 01:45:48.271]  You know, decentralized blockchain, it technically is very private and they want growth.
[01:45:48.331 --> 01:45:50.133]  Why do people invest in gold and silver?
[01:45:50.613 --> 01:45:54.077]  Because it's a private transaction and because there's growth behind it.
[01:45:54.478 --> 01:45:58.082]  So philosophically, both of those two are very, very similar.
[01:45:59.778 --> 01:46:04.063]  They're dissimilar in the sense of one is digital, one is tangible.
[01:46:04.463 --> 01:46:07.507]  If it's digital, it can be tracked, it can be shut off.
[01:46:07.907 --> 01:46:12.192]  If you own a tangible asset, then that's the ultimate in safety.
[01:46:12.252 --> 01:46:13.613]  So as I compare the two...
[01:46:16.136 --> 01:46:17.577]  Make your point about it, then I'll make my point.
[01:46:17.657 --> 01:46:29.183]  Yeah, so if you look at the fundamentals behind crypto and gold and silver, I think the foundational pillars of why people want them, the philosophy behind it, is exactly the same.
[01:46:29.703 --> 01:46:39.949]  Now, what's different is safety and asset preservation and having something in a worst-case scenario that you can use to barter with, for example.
[01:46:40.029 --> 01:46:44.912]  Have something that's not digital, that can't be tracked, that you own, that you can take with you.
[01:46:45.592 --> 01:46:48.076]  What if there's, you know, let's take a worst case scenario.
[01:46:48.096 --> 01:46:49.678]  We're seeing solar flares right now, right?
[01:46:49.738 --> 01:46:51.501]  What if the power grid goes out?
[01:46:51.581 --> 01:46:57.329]  What if there's communication disruption and you can't access... By the way, a bunch of satellites did go out.
[01:46:58.491 --> 01:46:59.012]  That did happen.
[01:46:59.592 --> 01:47:01.395]  Yeah, I mean, those kind of things are...
[01:47:02.344 --> 01:47:04.685]  Who knows why this is happening?
[01:47:04.705 --> 01:47:05.525]  I mean, God knows.
[01:47:06.005 --> 01:47:08.246]  But what about an EMP blast?
[01:47:08.286 --> 01:47:09.106]  What about anything?
[01:47:09.286 --> 01:47:10.746]  Anything digital that you have?
[01:47:10.786 --> 01:47:17.989]  Sure, gold and silver to me is like family you can trust, a relationship with God, a garden, some canned foods, and gold and silver.
[01:47:18.049 --> 01:47:21.950]  And again, I don't like the fight between crypto and precious metals.
[01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:24.330]  To me, it's another space you need to cover.
[01:47:24.370 --> 01:47:25.871]  I think gold and silver is more important.
[01:47:26.792 --> 01:47:30.637]  Because it is tangible, and possession's not against the law, and you've got to hold it.
[01:47:30.677 --> 01:47:41.532]  And I'm all for new systems to communicate, and Bitcoin, and I'm not for the central bank digital currencies and their own systems, but the attacks by the Bitcoin people against gold and silver is just stupid.
[01:47:41.872 --> 01:47:44.396]  And I can tell you behind the scenes, the folks that are in that are buying gold and silver.
[01:47:44.836 --> 01:47:49.058]  So, I mean, it's really just a box people need to check.
[01:47:49.398 --> 01:47:53.119]  And people say, well, how are you going to take a piece of silver or gold into a grocery store?
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:48:03.203]  No, when they're devaluing the currency, and everyone wants gold and silver, you can cash it in at that point for whatever inflation is, and gold will meet that, or silver will surpass that.
[01:48:03.504 --> 01:48:05.384]  So it's only a way to basically insure, in my view.
[01:48:05.684 --> 01:48:07.865]  I don't even see it as an investment, though it is a good one overall.
[01:48:08.205 --> 01:48:10.306]  I see it as just another emergency hedge.
[01:48:10.566 --> 01:48:11.827]  People recognize gold and silver.
[01:48:12.387 --> 01:48:17.948]  It's an insurance policy against a collapsing currency, against an inflated currency, against everything.
[01:48:18.248 --> 01:48:26.411]  To me, gold, Alex, is the perfect barometer of people distrusting the government.
[01:48:26.871 --> 01:48:29.391]  So, for example, you look back to the Reagan years.
[01:48:30.732 --> 01:48:32.012]  What happened during the Reagan years?
[01:48:32.572 --> 01:48:38.638]  Interest rates came down, jobs were created, taxes came down, the Cold War was over, the Berlin Wall came down.
[01:48:39.219 --> 01:48:46.265]  Remember, Newt Gingrich had this contract with America and Democrats and Republicans were actually talking and cutting deals together.
[01:48:46.646 --> 01:48:48.888]  It was like a fat and happy time for America.
[01:48:48.928 --> 01:48:49.509]  So therefore...
[01:48:50.109 --> 01:48:53.131]  What did gold do during that, really, 20 years?
[01:48:53.191 --> 01:48:59.995]  From 1982 until about 2002, it went from $250 an ounce to $258.
[01:49:00.496 --> 01:49:03.458]  It went up $8 in 20 years.
[01:49:03.718 --> 01:49:08.000]  That's nothing, but everything else was smooth sailing in America.
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:10.242]  It was almost like a renaissance for America.
[01:49:10.262 --> 01:49:10.982]  It was so good.
[01:49:11.443 --> 01:49:14.765]  But now, we can't say that the same is true right now.
[01:49:15.365 --> 01:49:16.825]  Everything is falling apart.
[01:49:16.865 --> 01:49:18.226]  We've got the opposite.
[01:49:18.666 --> 01:49:22.747]  And now we've got something even worse, which we didn't have back then.
[01:49:22.787 --> 01:49:25.408]  We haven't had this actually ever.
[01:49:25.848 --> 01:49:31.449]  And that is the BRICS nations, Alex, are taking over global monetary dominance.
[01:49:31.509 --> 01:49:34.490]  They've dismantled the petrodollar.
[01:49:35.010 --> 01:49:38.911]  And so now there's really no international demand for the US dollar.
[01:49:39.271 --> 01:49:41.812]  And therefore, every dollar that we print
[01:49:42.472 --> 01:49:42.813]  Is it?
[01:49:59.353 --> 01:50:06.234]  Martin Armstrong, an amazing forecaster, he does, you know, social forecasting, political, economic, all of that.
[01:50:06.814 --> 01:50:12.496]  He now says that we're in a wartime economy and these things don't end anytime real soon.
[01:50:13.036 --> 01:50:17.316]  And so when you're in a wartime economy, people start to act out of fear.
[01:50:17.797 --> 01:50:20.037]  People start to make different decisions.
[01:50:20.677 --> 01:50:24.178]  And this is where I look at these trends as well.
[01:50:25.878 --> 01:50:41.109]  What is going to happen when central bank digital currency comes and hits the mainstream, which is probably going to happen, Alex, as soon as September of this year, because the United Nations is meeting at their UN pact for the future.
[01:50:41.129 --> 01:50:42.931]  Oh, the EU said last year it's coming out this year.
[01:50:43.359 --> 01:50:58.449]  Yeah, and so I would say just because they're announcing that they're ready, World Economic Forum has said that 98% of the world is actually ready for central bank digital currency, doesn't mean that on day one all of these countries are going to be implementing it.
[01:50:58.469 --> 01:51:00.071]  Well, I played the clip from Davos last week.
[01:51:00.331 --> 01:51:04.654]  The central banker said, we're not going to call it CBDC, we're just rolling it out.
[01:51:05.895 --> 01:51:15.179]  They're taking the CBD part, the central bank digital part out of it and just calling it currency to make it mainstream so there's going to be broader acceptance.
[01:51:15.579 --> 01:51:19.920]  But that announcement is going to be made in September with the UN and their meeting in China.
[01:51:20.321 --> 01:51:28.624]  But probably within 12 months after that, you should see, I would say, almost full adoption of central bank digital.
[01:51:28.664 --> 01:51:29.884]  And won't they need a crisis?
[01:51:29.904 --> 01:51:31.685]  They've said this themselves to get this through.
[01:51:32.554 --> 01:51:32.794]  Yes.
[01:51:33.314 --> 01:51:47.320]  I mean, every time you have a public policy change in things, a change in the economy, a change in currency, you have to take either incremental steps for people to accept it, or something that's massive.
[01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:57.083]  Just in your face, things change, and people out of fear say, please- A cyber attack, a new virus, a bigger war, burning down the country.
[01:51:57.143 --> 01:51:58.964]  The Democrats said they're going to do that if Trump gets reelected.
[01:51:59.484 --> 01:52:00.245]  We're 170-something days out, folks.
[01:52:01.465 --> 01:52:02.385]  Yeah, or bank failure.
[01:52:02.405 --> 01:52:04.566]  I mean, all of those things could add into that.
[01:52:04.726 --> 01:52:06.027]  Oh, bank failure, you're right.
[01:52:06.067 --> 01:52:07.047]  That's the big one.
[01:52:07.247 --> 01:52:07.908]  You're betting on that.
[01:52:08.308 --> 01:52:11.269]  I'm betting on that, and I think, well, I wish it wouldn't happen.
[01:52:11.289 --> 01:52:12.310]  No, no, no, baby, you're betting it.
[01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:14.791]  But yeah, I'm guessing that that is going to happen.
[01:52:14.811 --> 01:52:16.531]  We're going to see a lot of bank failures this year.
[01:52:16.631 --> 01:52:22.334]  I think the Republic First Bank in Philly was the first one, and there's going to be many more that follow.
[01:52:22.354 --> 01:52:23.594]  So what's going to happen, Alex?
[01:52:25.995 --> 01:52:41.878]  The governments, the central banks of this world, in combination with the governments, are going to start demonizing all other decentralized blockchain cryptocurrencies because they are private, but they're going to want something that's centralized, that's not private.
[01:52:41.898 --> 01:52:44.939]  So they're going to go after Bitcoin, they're going to go after gold and silver, everything.
[01:52:45.199 --> 01:52:45.379]  Yeah.
[01:52:45.399 --> 01:52:50.520]  But the difference is they're going to go after the people supplying it, they're going to cut it off at the head, they're not going to try to confiscate it because it's only 2% or less.
[01:52:51.300 --> 01:53:01.792]  Yeah, if I were an evil politician, I wouldn't waste any time on trying to confiscate something that only 0.9% of the population owns like silver, or 2% of the population owns gold.
[01:53:02.293 --> 01:53:04.435]  I mean, Alex, if you were an evil politician,
[01:53:05.615 --> 01:53:06.876]  I would go after the masses.
[01:53:06.896 --> 01:53:08.337]  Oh, we're shutting down these corrupt people.
[01:53:08.717 --> 01:53:10.498]  They'll use a few bad apples to do it.
[01:53:10.538 --> 01:53:15.121]  Yeah, they'll do that to change how it's defined, to change what's legal and what's not legal.
[01:53:15.521 --> 01:53:17.082]  But they're going to go after the masses.
[01:53:17.322 --> 01:53:28.289]  If they want money because they're running out, I would go after the 98% of the population that has brokerage accounts, checking accounts, savings accounts, where it's low-lying.
[01:53:28.369 --> 01:53:29.470]  And that's called a bail-in.
[01:53:29.850 --> 01:53:33.575]  That's a bail-in and they've already legislated that, the Dodd-Frank bill under Obama.
[01:53:33.895 --> 01:53:35.517]  They've already legislated bail-in.
[01:53:35.537 --> 01:53:37.580]  This is not a dystopian future.
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:39.322]  This is not something that we're predicting.
[01:53:39.382 --> 01:53:40.423]  It's already here right now.
[01:53:40.964 --> 01:53:45.590]  All they need is the appropriate crisis, the government running out of money where they can institute a bail-in.
[01:53:46.071 --> 01:53:47.913]  So that is coming.
[01:53:49.602 --> 01:54:04.472]  Here's where I think we're on the precipice of a global tectonic shift in philosophy, in how our economy is run, how our government is run.
[01:54:07.674 --> 01:54:13.575]  A Scottish historian from the late 1700s named Alexander Tytler.
[01:54:13.635 --> 01:54:18.097]  So I'm going to go over his cycle of democracy.
[01:54:18.137 --> 01:54:22.578]  Now for everybody watching, I'm not saying that we're in a democracy.
[01:54:23.058 --> 01:54:24.658]  We have a republic.
[01:54:24.798 --> 01:54:25.378]  It's different.
[01:54:25.738 --> 01:54:27.039]  But listen to this trend.
[01:54:28.564 --> 01:54:36.228]  Yes, the trend is going to hold very true, and as we go through these steps, you're going to see how this plays out.
[01:54:36.268 --> 01:54:39.289]  So again, Alexander Tyler, Scottish historian from the late 1700s, he said,
[01:54:41.644 --> 01:54:44.925]  A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government.
[01:54:45.385 --> 01:54:50.866]  It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury.
[01:54:51.526 --> 01:55:04.549]  From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship.
[01:55:05.089 --> 01:55:07.470]  So, as we're thinking about this, it's like,
[01:55:08.595 --> 01:55:10.375]  Dang, that's actually true.
[01:55:10.756 --> 01:55:17.357]  We're voting for people who are going to promise the most things, whether it's free health care, free this, whatever.
[01:55:17.617 --> 01:55:19.898]  People vote for politicians that give them stuff.
[01:55:20.658 --> 01:55:25.800]  So, the average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been 200 years.
[01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:26.860]  That's the average.
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:28.701]  So, when did we start as a nation? 1776.
[01:55:31.602 --> 01:55:39.128]  1876, 1976, so you're looking at 250 years into this experiment called America.
[01:55:39.248 --> 01:55:40.649]  And there's a fourth turning happening.
[01:55:40.949 --> 01:55:41.610]  Fourth turning?
[01:55:41.770 --> 01:55:43.531]  I mean, Neil Howe's book was incredible.
[01:55:43.551 --> 01:55:45.373]  It's all these megatrends are coming together now.
[01:55:45.693 --> 01:55:46.194]  All of them.
[01:55:46.254 --> 01:55:48.195]  It's like the convergence of a perfect storm.
[01:55:48.555 --> 01:55:50.137]  So listen to this cycle, though.
[01:55:50.217 --> 01:55:51.358]  It's a mega realignment.
[01:55:52.362 --> 01:55:53.263]  We're good to go.
[01:56:15.427 --> 01:56:17.011]  I mean, how true is that statement?
[01:56:17.592 --> 01:56:19.777]  With technology, everything is advancing.
[01:56:19.978 --> 01:56:22.483]  Knowledge is doubling at a very rapid clip.
[01:56:24.123 --> 01:56:28.967]  The cycle of democracy, the nations progress through a sequence.
[01:56:29.328 --> 01:56:34.152]  And let's use America as the example here because I think it'll give a great understanding to this.
[01:56:34.652 --> 01:56:49.444]  We go from bondage to spiritual faith, from spiritual faith to great courage, from courage to liberty, from liberty to abundance, from abundance to selfishness, from selfishness to apathy, and from apathy to dependence, and then dependence back into bondage.
[01:56:49.524 --> 01:56:52.367]  So let's play these out in our
[01:56:53.627 --> 01:56:56.870]  Nation so how did how did we become a nation?
[01:56:57.370 --> 01:57:04.636]  You know our our Ancestors came from Europe and they were looking for what they were looking for religious freedom.
[01:57:04.816 --> 01:57:16.805]  That's why they left They didn't like that oppression so from bondage to spiritual faith that spiritual faith led to great courage we fought the Revolutionary War and we won and that gave us Liberty and
[01:57:17.225 --> 01:57:19.187]  And then that liberty led to abundance.
[01:57:19.267 --> 01:57:20.429]  People started working.
[01:57:20.489 --> 01:57:22.431]  They could work in the fields.
[01:57:22.571 --> 01:57:28.477]  We started industry and people worked for a living and that created abundance.
[01:57:28.537 --> 01:57:32.922]  They weren't feudal slaves anymore that were working on somebody else's land but could never get out of it.
[01:57:33.523 --> 01:57:34.644]  They were actually free for the first time.
[01:57:34.884 --> 01:57:37.527]  Yeah, they didn't have to give everything they had back to the government.
[01:57:37.547 --> 01:57:41.811]  And this was why America was so great, because it gave us financial freedom.
[01:57:41.831 --> 01:57:46.296]  And now they could buy things, and buy land, and open a restaurant, or write a book.
[01:57:46.376 --> 01:57:47.697]  Now you had time to do something.
[01:57:47.777 --> 01:57:48.038]  Yeah.
[01:57:48.438 --> 01:57:58.008]  See, all of these freedoms that came when America started, what the Founding Fathers envisioned for us, personal freedoms, and political freedoms, and religious freedoms, and health freedoms, and all of that,
[01:57:58.148 --> 01:58:02.491]  And that's why the globals are attacking the American system because they're selling total tyranny, eat the bugs.
[01:58:02.711 --> 01:58:06.094]  They've got to discredit this system because people can't have something else to aspire to.
[01:58:06.414 --> 01:58:13.399]  Yeah, so view this human nature, this is just human nature, when you start to have abundance
[01:58:13.979 --> 01:58:15.340]  You start to get selfish.
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:16.941]  And it's like, mind, mind, mind, mind.
[01:58:16.981 --> 01:58:18.061]  I want to accumulate this.
[01:58:18.201 --> 01:58:19.622]  Greed just starts to set in.
[01:58:19.662 --> 01:58:20.743]  The decadence is setting in.
[01:58:20.823 --> 01:58:21.443]  Start over at the beginning.
[01:58:21.463 --> 01:58:21.944]  I'm interrupting.
[01:58:21.984 --> 01:58:22.984]  Start over at the beginning again.
[01:58:23.504 --> 01:58:25.906]  Because again, there's a shorter version of this.
[01:58:26.426 --> 01:58:28.407]  Hard times make strong men.
[01:58:28.707 --> 01:58:29.828]  Strong men make good times.
[01:58:29.868 --> 01:58:30.969]  Good times make weak men.
[01:58:31.249 --> 01:58:32.109]  Weak men make hard times.
[01:58:32.930 --> 01:58:35.091]  Yeah, that's a good paraphrase.
[01:58:35.131 --> 01:58:36.652]  So here's the progression.
[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:39.600]  Bondage to spiritual faith.
[01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:41.461]  Spiritual faith to great courage.
[01:58:41.921 --> 01:58:42.901]  Courage to liberty.
[01:58:43.001 --> 01:58:44.041]  Liberty to abundance.
[01:58:44.521 --> 01:58:49.182]  Abundance to selfishness, where you just start collecting things for you and you stop giving it away.
[01:58:50.063 --> 01:58:51.743]  And then selfishness to apathy.
[01:58:52.263 --> 01:58:58.184]  Once your wallets get really thick and fat and you're just kind of smooth sailing through life, you get apathetic.
[01:58:58.224 --> 01:58:59.685]  What happens when you get apathetic?
[01:58:59.725 --> 01:59:00.625]  You stop caring.
[01:59:01.025 --> 01:59:02.185]  You stop voting.
[01:59:02.265 --> 01:59:05.026]  You stop listening to the things that are important because
[01:59:05.566 --> 01:59:06.967]  Your wallets are fat.
[01:59:07.088 --> 01:59:08.889]  You're stagnant.
[01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:18.939]  And then that apathy, though, when a period of apathy, you go back into dependence because you stopped caring and people got voted in that shouldn't have been voted in.
[01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:22.523]  And then that dependence leads back into bondage.
[01:59:22.943 --> 01:59:27.308]  And so in this cycle, where would you say that America is?
[01:59:27.428 --> 01:59:28.589]  I mean, going into bondage.
[01:59:29.049 --> 01:59:30.911]  We're in dependence back into bondage.
[01:59:30.971 --> 01:59:32.653]  We're at the last stage.
[01:59:33.173 --> 01:59:34.615]  So we go back into bondage.
[01:59:34.895 --> 01:59:39.240]  I think central bank digital currency is the financial form of bondage.
[01:59:40.181 --> 01:59:41.842]  You're going to have political bondage.
[01:59:41.862 --> 01:59:44.365]  You're going to have all of these things that you can't do this.
[01:59:44.405 --> 01:59:45.246]  You can't travel.
[01:59:45.626 --> 01:59:48.108]  We already saw the test of that with with COVID.
[01:59:48.769 --> 02:00:05.909]  You know, and everything that Dr. Judy was talking about before me on the show, and it's like... Oh, Davos admits, and they were at Davos, the WF last week, saying, we use COVID as training wheels for the COVID lockdowns and total control, and Germany's going to ban cars on the weekend this summer, now!
[02:00:06.270 --> 02:00:06.410]  Yeah.
[02:00:06.570 --> 02:00:08.512]  I mean, it's all going down, folks!
[02:00:09.012 --> 02:00:10.033]  Right in front of us!
[02:00:10.093 --> 02:00:31.471]  And so, you've got all these freedoms that are eroding, the political freedoms, our financial freedoms, our economic freedoms, our personal freedoms, and to me, the banking system, our ability to buy or sell when we want to, is the ultimate form of bondage in a financial form, and that's why I think we're right at the end of this cycle.
[02:00:31.811 --> 02:00:33.192]  And so, what comes next?
[02:00:33.393 --> 02:00:34.473]  So, Alex,
[02:00:35.274 --> 02:00:44.179]  If you go back to, you're a historian like I am, if you go back to 1776, what caused the Revolutionary War?
[02:00:44.239 --> 02:00:44.819]  What caused it?
[02:00:44.919 --> 02:00:46.620]  It was religious freedom.
[02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:52.023]  America was founded on a pro-God, pro-family movement.
[02:00:52.043 --> 02:00:53.563]  They wanted their freedoms.
[02:00:53.924 --> 02:00:55.925]  So same year, 1776, was also the French Revolution.
[02:00:58.826 --> 02:01:03.607]  The French Revolution, the peasants rose up and they wanted money to, you know, they wanted the government to take care of them.
[02:01:04.227 --> 02:01:07.068]  And that revolution, they won.
[02:01:07.348 --> 02:01:10.349]  And France to this day is still a socialist nation.
[02:01:10.369 --> 02:01:12.169]  Because it was communist, it wasn't our version.
[02:01:12.569 --> 02:01:14.210]  It was a completely different version.
[02:01:14.230 --> 02:01:15.790]  They didn't have the constitution we had or the leaders.
[02:01:15.850 --> 02:01:24.592]  Yeah, so I see us right now, this paradigm shifting moment, this time in history where it's like the tale of two revolutions and which one is going to win.
[02:01:25.132 --> 02:01:28.074]  Are we going to have another American-style revolution?
[02:01:28.374 --> 02:01:30.055]  Are we going to have a French-style revolution?
[02:01:30.075 --> 02:01:39.301]  And that's what Soros wants, is an off-of-their-heads, unending purge that goes on forever for our system, a whole new system of the Republic where everybody's rights are protected.
[02:01:39.621 --> 02:01:39.841]  Yes.
[02:01:40.442 --> 02:01:44.044]  And who gets to decide what's going on?
[02:01:44.584 --> 02:01:49.548]  You know, enough people wake up, enough people start smelling what's happening.
[02:01:49.588 --> 02:01:50.468]  But what you said is key.
[02:01:50.648 --> 02:01:52.009]  We're in a revolution whether you like it or not.
[02:01:52.349 --> 02:01:53.010]  It's who's going to win it.
[02:01:53.450 --> 02:01:53.650]  Yes.
[02:01:53.770 --> 02:01:59.317]  We're already in the Civil War, but it's not the people fighting over black versus white they want it to be, it's us versus the globalists.
[02:01:59.337 --> 02:01:59.698]  Start over.
[02:01:59.898 --> 02:02:02.521]  Yeah, and I think as we look at this...
[02:02:03.527 --> 02:02:05.248]  This is why you do what you do.
[02:02:05.268 --> 02:02:18.836]  This is why I do what I do economically, is to bring freedoms, to express this message of, yeah, you think you might want the government to take care of you, you think you might want them to give you money, but when they do that, you become a slave to them.
[02:02:18.896 --> 02:02:28.641]  You become in bondage to them, and if they can cut you off from buying or selling based on your ideology, this becomes, we're marching down the road... That's mind control!
[02:02:28.701 --> 02:02:29.462]  That's the ultimate!
[02:02:29.662 --> 02:02:30.785]  It is the ultimate mind control.
[02:02:30.805 --> 02:02:31.446]  It's a mark of the beast.
[02:02:31.887 --> 02:02:32.769]  You're a theologian too.
[02:02:32.989 --> 02:02:33.831]  Yeah, and I think...
[02:02:34.986 --> 02:02:40.728]  So, during times in history, you know, the Christian churches thought, oh my word, the mark of the beast is coming.
[02:02:40.748 --> 02:02:42.028]  By the way, you're not some lightweight theologian.
[02:02:42.068 --> 02:02:44.148]  You were on the board, like, focused on the family, all that stuff.
[02:02:44.408 --> 02:03:01.113]  Yeah, I served on Dr. Dobson's board for like seven years, but I operated in those circles, in those Christian conservative circles a lot, and I have a lot of friends in there, and you know, throughout time, even going back, people thought that Hitler was the Antichrist, people thought that,
[02:03:01.673 --> 02:03:02.113]  We're good to go.
[02:03:19.020 --> 02:03:21.061]  And you have to submit to get the mark.
[02:03:21.322 --> 02:03:24.604]  You have to worship the beast, which means total commitment to get the mark.
[02:03:24.624 --> 02:03:25.784]  People say, oh, it's just a mark.
[02:03:25.824 --> 02:03:27.726]  No, you have to follow what it says.
[02:03:27.786 --> 02:03:29.747]  Cut your son's genitals off.
[02:03:30.207 --> 02:03:31.488]  You've got to support pedophilia.
[02:03:31.508 --> 02:03:33.109]  You've got to support world government.
[02:03:33.129 --> 02:03:36.211]  You have to worship the beast to get the mark.
[02:03:36.671 --> 02:03:39.373]  Yeah, and so the mark of the beast isn't just for America.
[02:03:39.513 --> 02:03:40.534]  It's not just for Europe.
[02:03:40.594 --> 02:03:41.554]  It's not just for Africa.
[02:03:41.654 --> 02:03:42.795]  It's a global beast.
[02:03:42.815 --> 02:03:44.376]  And what is Klaus Schwab and all these guys?
[02:03:44.416 --> 02:03:45.197]  They are a beast.
[02:03:45.757 --> 02:03:46.778]  They are attacking us!
[02:04:02.162 --> 02:04:09.827]  The ability to cut people off digital via central bank digital currency and biometric identification to your bank accounts.
[02:04:10.327 --> 02:04:19.272]  Now this, to me, is the first time in history where a Mark of the Beast type system in that... How did people... How did John... I mean, I'm a Patmos Envisionist.
[02:04:19.312 --> 02:04:20.133]  That's God.
[02:04:20.653 --> 02:04:21.934]  I mean, this is happening.
[02:04:22.214 --> 02:04:22.894]  Hallelujah!
[02:04:23.074 --> 02:04:23.895]  We're eternal spirits.
[02:04:23.935 --> 02:04:24.755]  I've already seen it myself.
[02:04:24.815 --> 02:04:27.137]  I don't... Most people don't get to have the experience I've had.
[02:04:27.177 --> 02:04:30.239]  God's blessed me to actually really show me stuff and tell me stuff so I know God's real.
[02:04:30.879 --> 02:04:32.601]  Both of you are like, oh, I don't know if it's real or whatever.
[02:04:32.641 --> 02:04:36.123]  No, God's real, your eternal spirit, but also, we're gonna go through this.
[02:04:36.464 --> 02:04:38.686]  Like, this is real, people, and you're seeing it happen.
[02:04:38.906 --> 02:04:40.727]  How did somebody 2,000 years ago envision this?
[02:04:40.947 --> 02:04:42.969]  How did Ezekiel 3,000 years ago envision this?
[02:04:43.489 --> 02:04:44.630]  How did Daniel envision this?
[02:04:45.251 --> 02:04:50.715]  Only with God, who knows the beginning from the end, and there is, God transcends time.
[02:04:51.696 --> 02:05:04.223]  So, of course, when God is seeing something, he's seeing the past, the present, and the future all at one time, and he's speaking that into the prophets, and they're just repeating it, and so... So God gives us free will, but he gives us a cheat sheet.
[02:05:05.223 --> 02:05:07.865]  He tells you, okay, you've got free will, by the way, this is what's going to happen.
[02:05:09.065 --> 02:05:10.586]  He knows what... This is what a father would do.
[02:05:11.206 --> 02:05:15.609]  I'm giving you free will, you're a new free creature, but I'm going to give you lessons and tell you how this works.
[02:05:16.049 --> 02:05:16.949]  Why would you not listen to the father?
[02:05:17.830 --> 02:05:19.571]  I mean, of course... Listen to our father.
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:30.823]  He tells us, in his word, how to live, how to survive, how to thrive, and he didn't say, Alex, ever, that this was gonna be an easy path.
[02:05:31.703 --> 02:05:33.964]  In fact, he said it was gonna be opposite.
[02:05:34.044 --> 02:05:38.445]  He said, hey, you're gonna be, Jesus said, you're gonna be persecuted when you follow me, right?
[02:05:38.505 --> 02:05:42.646]  But the end result is this amazing life of peace.
[02:05:42.666 --> 02:05:45.347]  We're given the keys to the universe after the boot camp.
[02:05:45.727 --> 02:05:47.027]  This is Marine Corps boot camp.
[02:05:47.147 --> 02:05:47.347]  Yeah.
[02:05:47.627 --> 02:05:48.828]  And God's like, it's gonna be tough now.
[02:05:49.841 --> 02:05:50.862]  The keys are waiting right here.
[02:05:51.422 --> 02:05:54.424]  Yeah, and just like the disciples, what are we called to do?
[02:05:54.464 --> 02:05:56.306]  We're called to be light in this dark world.
[02:05:57.487 --> 02:05:59.808]  You're a light in this dark world by spreading this message.
[02:06:00.469 --> 02:06:02.170]  I do financial stuff.
[02:06:02.330 --> 02:06:11.537]  Everybody watching this show has the ability to be light to your neighbor in your workplace, everywhere, and the only way that this message of hope
[02:06:12.037 --> 02:06:12.797]  Which there is hope.
[02:06:13.038 --> 02:06:17.560]  Just because we're talking about garbage and what the government's doing, we didn't create that.
[02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:23.203]  We're talking about how do you not just... We're talking about the problems so we can avoid it, but again, think about that.
[02:06:24.424 --> 02:06:25.685]  God is eternal.
[02:06:26.085 --> 02:06:29.126]  God can make new creatures that have free will that are eternal.
[02:06:29.827 --> 02:06:31.208]  They weren't before, but they're now made.
[02:06:31.228 --> 02:06:32.108]  That's beautiful.
[02:06:32.869 --> 02:06:34.609]  How do you test an eternal creature?
[02:06:34.910 --> 02:06:38.532]  You put it in a body, you put it under stress, you put it there to see what it's going to do.
[02:06:39.272 --> 02:06:40.432]  I mean, it's right there, folks!
[02:06:40.472 --> 02:06:40.872]  That's it!
[02:06:41.012 --> 02:06:41.492]  It's real!
[02:06:41.512 --> 02:06:43.133]  I mean, we are eternal!
[02:06:43.293 --> 02:06:43.653]  Done!
[02:06:43.673 --> 02:06:46.013]  There should be no discussion!
[02:06:46.053 --> 02:06:46.794]  Do what God says!
[02:06:47.294 --> 02:06:49.594]  Yeah, I mean, tested by fire.
[02:06:49.614 --> 02:06:52.435]  I mean, so what will survive?
[02:06:53.155 --> 02:06:55.035]  Things that have eternal value.
[02:06:55.555 --> 02:06:59.196]  You know, you can't really take anything with you, ever, except your reputation.
[02:06:59.756 --> 02:07:02.617]  And I want to hear, Alex, when I'm done,
[02:07:03.397 --> 02:07:12.628]  On this earth, and I meet Jesus face-to-face on Judgment Day, and I look into his fiery eyeballs, I want him to say, well done my good and faithful servant, with you I am well pleased.
[02:07:13.029 --> 02:07:13.169]  Right?
[02:07:13.209 --> 02:07:18.816]  Because if I don't hear that, if you don't hear that, nobody that hears anything...
[02:07:19.116 --> 02:07:25.060]  If you don't hear those words, you're not going to like the other words that come out of the great judge's mouth, right?
[02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:29.382]  So here's where we go through life and we spread this message of hope.
[02:07:29.422 --> 02:07:33.765]  We give solutions to eliminate and melt away people's fear.
[02:07:34.165 --> 02:07:39.448]  Fear is a tactic of the enemy to actually get people to do something that they don't want to do.
[02:07:39.769 --> 02:07:41.650]  So fear will cause you to not act.
[02:07:41.710 --> 02:07:43.411]  Fear will cause you to make a wrong decision.
[02:07:43.751 --> 02:07:45.572]  But God didn't give us a spirit of fear.
[02:07:45.592 --> 02:07:48.554]  He gave us a spirit of a sound mind and wisdom and creativity.
[02:07:48.994 --> 02:07:58.318]  And everything that the Creator of the Universe instills in each and every one of us, we can operate in that amazing anti-spirit of fear.
[02:07:58.458 --> 02:07:59.398]  It's faith, Alex.
[02:07:59.539 --> 02:08:04.921]  It's love and commitment and loyalty and honor and
[02:08:05.601 --> 02:08:06.102]  Freedom.
[02:08:06.623 --> 02:08:08.086]  I mean, literally, it's freedom.
[02:08:08.126 --> 02:08:11.511]  This is what the founding fathers envisioned for this country.
[02:08:11.531 --> 02:08:13.014]  That's all Satan offers is slavery.
[02:08:13.415 --> 02:08:15.739]  And we've deviated from that so much.
[02:08:16.159 --> 02:08:19.225]  To me, it's like, it's no wonder we are where we are in this country.
[02:08:20.673 --> 02:08:23.874]  It's surprising we've gone this far and God hasn't blown us up.
[02:08:24.614 --> 02:08:25.595]  I mean, seriously.
[02:08:27.155 --> 02:08:34.437]  It's mind-numbing to me that God has tarried so long, but He's a God that's full of grace.
[02:08:34.477 --> 02:08:35.918]  He's a God that's full of mercy.
[02:08:36.438 --> 02:08:45.020]  And we then, during this time that's left on this earth, we have to actually take that rallying cry and do something good.
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:47.741]  And here's the cycle of democracy going back to that.
[02:08:48.001 --> 02:08:48.421]  Start over.
[02:08:48.441 --> 02:08:49.182]  I keep interrupting.
[02:08:49.222 --> 02:08:49.882]  This is important.
[02:08:50.282 --> 02:08:52.323]  You're getting to the theological, but yeah, go through it again.
[02:08:52.343 --> 02:09:05.287]  I mean, well, we're pretty much done with it, but if we don't do something, this cycle, this revolution that we are in, we will actually be a French-style revolution if we don't wake up.
[02:09:05.547 --> 02:09:06.367]  And that's what it's all about.
[02:09:06.507 --> 02:09:08.008]  God wants us to break the cycle.
[02:09:08.508 --> 02:09:17.131]  Because again, if you're God and created all of the universe and all that there is, which this is happening, what's the one thing you can do that's different?
[02:09:17.771 --> 02:09:19.512]  You create creatures that have free will.
[02:09:19.972 --> 02:09:23.774]  But if they have free will, then there's like, oh, but they might be bad.
[02:09:24.095 --> 02:09:35.121]  So then God, again, literally puts himself into a human to come out here and teach us, does all this, influences us, sends the angels, sends the Holy Spirit, everything to like guide the children.
[02:09:35.141 --> 02:09:41.525]  Remember, the Bible talks about God loves a sparrow so much, think how much God loves you.
[02:09:41.585 --> 02:09:43.466]  God can't stand losing any of us.
[02:09:43.886 --> 02:09:46.047]  But God did this to give us free will.
[02:09:46.127 --> 02:09:46.728]  What a gift!
[02:09:48.357 --> 02:09:56.583]  And it's not a suggestion from him, it's a command, don't worry about tomorrow.
[02:09:56.843 --> 02:10:01.686]  So here's in my simpleton view, how do you succeed in this world?
[02:10:01.746 --> 02:10:02.747]  I think there's two things.
[02:10:03.227 --> 02:10:05.029]  Number one, you be an extravagant giver.
[02:10:06.295 --> 02:10:15.020]  And because God tells us in Malachi 6, when you give and when you give with a grateful heart, watch out because the floodgates of heaven are going to be opened up so much you won't have room enough to contain the blessing.
[02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:18.862]  That could be a financial blessing, relationship blessing, all kinds of different blessings.
[02:10:18.922 --> 02:10:19.783]  Healthy children.
[02:10:20.263 --> 02:10:20.603]  All of it.
[02:10:20.643 --> 02:10:22.284]  It doesn't say what the blessing is.
[02:10:22.304 --> 02:10:24.345]  It just says blessing so much you can't contain it.
[02:10:24.786 --> 02:10:26.667]  And number two, never give up.
[02:10:27.452 --> 02:10:40.399]  You know, if I were going from Colorado to California and I were going on this track, if I keep walking, if I keep riding a bike, if I keep running, if I keep driving, I will ultimately get to California.
[02:10:40.419 --> 02:10:40.880]  To the ocean.
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:43.901]  But if you stop, well then you're never going to get there.
[02:10:44.241 --> 02:10:46.663]  So if you don't give up and you have extravagant
[02:10:47.203 --> 02:10:54.247]  Giving, and actually thirdly, I'll add this one in there, you love your neighbor, but to love your neighbor, you have to love yourself first.
[02:10:54.668 --> 02:10:55.988]  You know, you have all those three things.
[02:10:56.008 --> 02:10:57.990]  And people think giving means just money.
[02:10:58.050 --> 02:11:00.491]  No, it's giving of energy, giving of caring.
[02:11:01.532 --> 02:11:08.476]  It's giving of your time, of your energy, of your compassion, of your prayers, of your finances, of your talents, of your brain.
[02:11:09.466 --> 02:11:09.966]  All of that.
[02:11:10.027 --> 02:11:11.187]  Well, I've experienced that.
[02:11:11.207 --> 02:11:13.509]  I didn't do this from some holy roller.
[02:11:13.609 --> 02:11:14.410]  I'm a perfect guy.
[02:11:14.430 --> 02:11:15.270]  I hated the tyrants.
[02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:16.852]  I love God, but God was kind of like, over here.
[02:11:17.092 --> 02:11:20.975]  Yeah, God, you're like a little helper, you know, the first 10, 15 years of this.
[02:11:21.295 --> 02:11:24.437]  But as I got more attack, I was like, no, it's all God now because he got so big.
[02:11:24.998 --> 02:11:28.801]  But every time I'm attacked, the doors blow open to victory.
[02:11:29.141 --> 02:11:30.902]  And every time I go, God, I'm not like Job.
[02:11:30.962 --> 02:11:33.444]  I think Job has, God, I don't want my children to die.
[02:11:33.864 --> 02:11:37.327]  But the point is nothing compared to Job, but it's like literally now I go, oh, I'm being attacked.
[02:11:37.447 --> 02:11:38.408]  Really good stuff's about to happen.
[02:11:39.508 --> 02:11:40.268]  I'm not a masochist.
[02:11:40.288 --> 02:11:43.249]  I don't like the pain, but I'm like, oh my god, big stuff.
[02:11:43.829 --> 02:11:45.950]  Every attack instantly leads to victory.
[02:11:46.590 --> 02:11:46.970]  It does.
[02:11:47.710 --> 02:11:48.851]  And the enemy is blind.
[02:11:48.891 --> 02:11:50.951]  They can't seem to see that.
[02:11:51.312 --> 02:11:55.573]  They have all these smarts about the world, their own system, but above that, they have no understanding.
[02:11:55.973 --> 02:11:56.173]  Yeah.
[02:11:56.846 --> 02:12:10.294]  So Alex, if we can shift our mindset as a society from short-term pleasure to medium and long-term gain and benefits, if you know where you want to go, what are you going to do to get there?
[02:12:10.354 --> 02:12:13.076]  If you want financial freedom, what are you going to do to get there?
[02:12:13.436 --> 02:12:16.398]  Is what you're doing now going to do it for you?
[02:12:17.518 --> 02:12:26.102]  If you need to lose weight and you just sit there on the couch eating potato chips and candy all day, are you going to get to your fort?
[02:12:26.723 --> 02:12:33.906]  Well, I don't mean this is an attack on crypto, because it has some uses, but God made the heavens, the earth, iron, the soil, the trees, us.
[02:12:34.186 --> 02:12:35.147]  He made gold and silver.
[02:12:35.167 --> 02:12:38.808]  I think at the end of the day, I'm betting on what God made gold and silver.
[02:12:41.098 --> 02:12:41.618]  I agree.
[02:12:41.738 --> 02:12:43.699]  I mean, it's... God made uranium.
[02:12:43.739 --> 02:12:44.759]  We blow up cities with it.
[02:12:44.799 --> 02:12:46.960]  I mean, God made some powerful stuff.
[02:12:47.260 --> 02:12:48.780]  This metal does this, this metal does that.
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:51.201]  He's like, here, here's the keys to the universe, boys.
[02:12:51.561 --> 02:12:52.461]  Yeah.
[02:12:52.621 --> 02:12:58.463]  And God is so powerful that he's not sitting up there scratching his beard thinking, look what's happening to the world.
[02:12:58.523 --> 02:12:59.663]  I didn't see this coming.
[02:12:59.703 --> 02:12:59.863]  No.
[02:13:00.004 --> 02:13:03.084]  He knows the beginning from the end, but he gives us solutions.
[02:13:03.164 --> 02:13:04.265]  And what I focus
[02:13:05.465 --> 02:13:17.376]  24-7, my time on is financial solutions for people to navigate through this storm, to have a smile on your face, because I know every... It's a no-brainer, people.
[02:13:17.636 --> 02:13:20.498]  I am pitching this because I wish I could do it myself, but I'm not.
[02:13:20.939 --> 02:13:22.300]  Everybody should be in silver and gold right now.
[02:13:23.183 --> 02:13:33.746]  Yeah, everybody with whatever portion of your assets gives you that peace of mind when you put your head down on the pillow at night, and you think, I don't want anybody to think, oh man, I've done too little, I've done too much.
[02:13:33.846 --> 02:13:35.326]  No, you have to do what's just right for you.
[02:13:35.666 --> 02:13:41.167]  Now for me, and my house, like 100% into silver, because it's the only thing that makes sense.
[02:13:41.227 --> 02:13:43.688]  And explain that, you'll buy the gold later with the silver money.
[02:13:44.482 --> 02:13:54.367]  Yeah, this is exciting because there's this historical ratio, which we've gone over on previous shows, between gold and silver, and historically that number is 20 to 1.
[02:13:54.427 --> 02:13:56.888]  It takes 20 ounces of silver to buy one ounce of gold.
[02:13:57.329 --> 02:13:59.750]  Well, today it's literally like 85 to 1.
[02:13:59.810 --> 02:14:01.851]  It's not at an all-time high, but it's really close.
[02:14:02.451 --> 02:14:04.452]  So, what does that number tell us?
[02:14:04.512 --> 02:14:06.113]  It tells us one of two things, Alex.
[02:14:06.153 --> 02:14:09.515]  It either says gold is overvalued or silver is undervalued.
[02:14:09.955 --> 02:14:11.696]  Well, do I think gold's overvalued?
[02:14:11.996 --> 02:14:12.177]  Nope.
[02:14:12.777 --> 02:14:14.898]  Because what causes gold to go up?
[02:14:15.499 --> 02:14:19.641]  Unsustainable debt, inflationary pressures, political chaos, geopolitical conflict.
[02:14:19.661 --> 02:14:21.082]  We have all of that in spades.
[02:14:21.102 --> 02:14:22.924]  And they're using naked shorts to suppress it all.
[02:14:23.384 --> 02:14:23.564]  Yeah.
[02:14:23.964 --> 02:14:25.986]  Wait till we get into the naked shorts and silver.
[02:14:26.006 --> 02:14:26.646]  I'm going to shut up.
[02:14:27.547 --> 02:14:30.108]  It's been a great discussion, but I said I'm going to shut up.
[02:14:30.128 --> 02:14:30.829]  You make me so excited.
[02:14:30.849 --> 02:14:32.530]  Keep going.
[02:14:32.910 --> 02:14:36.493]  But if gold's not overvalued, it's going to continue to grow.
[02:14:37.473 --> 02:14:38.994]  Uh, what's silver going to do?
[02:14:39.155 --> 02:14:40.616]  It's going to outperform.
[02:14:40.976 --> 02:14:46.240]  So in theory, let's just say over the next 12 to 18 months, silver triples the rate of growth of gold.
[02:14:46.661 --> 02:14:50.844]  Well, what I would recommend is we sell our silver, go into gold.
[02:14:50.884 --> 02:14:51.605]  And what did I just do?
[02:14:51.645 --> 02:14:55.528]  I got you triple the amount of rate of gold then that what I could have purchased for you today.
[02:14:55.868 --> 02:14:57.429]  Again, that's free ounces.
[02:14:57.570 --> 02:14:59.291]  Technically, that's extra ounces.
[02:14:59.371 --> 02:15:00.152]  Go slow, though.
[02:15:00.172 --> 02:15:01.192]  People ask me in the street.
[02:15:01.673 --> 02:15:02.514]  Explain it slowly.
[02:15:02.774 --> 02:15:02.954]  Yeah.
[02:15:03.414 --> 02:15:06.096]  So if we're Alec, if gold is growing.
[02:15:07.037 --> 02:15:09.299]  And silver is growing faster.
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:11.201]  Well, then what?
[02:15:11.301 --> 02:15:14.564]  Let's just say it triples the rate of growth of gold.
[02:15:15.085 --> 02:15:24.955]  Well, I'll sell the silver, go into gold, and if silver tripled the rate of growth of gold, we can get almost triple the amount of ounces of gold then, as what I could have purchased for you today.
[02:15:25.015 --> 02:15:27.917]  So if you could have purchased 100 ounces of gold today,
[02:15:28.678 --> 02:15:31.040]  And we allocate into silver, it outperforms.
[02:15:31.401 --> 02:15:36.806]  I could maybe get you 250, 300 ounces of gold down the road, depending on that ratio.
[02:15:36.966 --> 02:15:39.829]  To me, this is the beginning of how we started the show.
[02:15:39.869 --> 02:15:43.112]  It's like, don't measure your wealth in terms of paper dollars.
[02:15:43.633 --> 02:15:49.238]  Measure it in the amount of metals and ounces that you control, because that was free gold.
[02:15:49.318 --> 02:15:51.881]  That extra 200 ounces in this example,
[02:15:52.441 --> 02:15:53.542]  Didn't come out of nowhere.
[02:15:53.602 --> 02:15:54.483]  It's not magic.
[02:15:54.963 --> 02:15:56.084]  It's just math.
[02:15:56.404 --> 02:16:00.767]  You allocate into the outperforming metal and sell it when the time is right.
[02:16:00.807 --> 02:16:03.149]  It's not like I'm married to silver.
[02:16:03.169 --> 02:16:04.710]  I couldn't care less, Alex.
[02:16:05.050 --> 02:16:08.353]  If it were pointing towards going to gold, I would go into gold.
[02:16:08.373 --> 02:16:13.797]  But why are the globalists, because I said this with the Hunt brothers and all covering it, they're obsessed with suppressing silver.
[02:16:13.817 --> 02:16:14.798]  They really don't like it.
[02:16:16.039 --> 02:16:17.600]  So there's a few reasons.
[02:16:19.441 --> 02:16:21.383]  I think number one is
[02:16:22.779 --> 02:16:27.942]  And I got a lot of this information from silverwars.org.
[02:16:29.262 --> 02:16:35.626]  Those guys are the guys behind Wall Street Bets and that whole thing when they were shorting GameStop.
[02:16:41.855 --> 02:16:47.801]  Going back to the Manhattan Project, you have the suppression of silver.
[02:16:47.861 --> 02:16:48.141]  Why?
[02:16:48.501 --> 02:16:52.906]  Because so much silver is needed in the defense industry.
[02:16:53.586 --> 02:16:54.167]  Like missiles.
[02:16:54.187 --> 02:16:55.568]  Let's see, I've got this.
[02:16:55.628 --> 02:16:56.969]  So they want to use it.
[02:16:57.470 --> 02:17:02.455]  They want to use it for everything that they can.
[02:17:04.534 --> 02:17:10.459]  In seven torpedoes, 34 kilograms of silver is used.
[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:17.465]  Some of these big ICBMs that need silver in them have 11,000 ounces of silver per missile.
[02:17:17.485 --> 02:17:17.985]  Wow!
[02:17:18.005 --> 02:17:20.027]  Per missile or torpedo.
[02:17:20.428 --> 02:17:32.257]  So if you look at the price being suppressed by the government, if the largest user of silver in the world is the defense industry, are they going to want those prices to be high or low?
[02:17:32.918 --> 02:17:35.939]  They're going to want them to be low, because they have to buy it.
[02:17:35.959 --> 02:17:37.160]  So it's so strategic.
[02:17:37.860 --> 02:17:42.282]  Very strategic, and it's been suppressed for a long time because of that.
[02:17:42.342 --> 02:17:45.443]  But here's where we're at the end of the road on this.
[02:17:46.164 --> 02:17:48.044]  Silver is a depleting asset.
[02:17:48.505 --> 02:17:49.985]  There's not much left.
[02:17:50.405 --> 02:17:55.187]  You know, COMEX available inventories are down 70% over the last 18 months.
[02:17:55.608 --> 02:17:56.848]  We're in a war economy.
[02:17:57.148 --> 02:17:58.629]  You need silver for all this stuff.
[02:17:59.349 --> 02:18:01.970]  If it runs out, then what?
[02:18:02.391 --> 02:18:04.832]  Do we just not actually produce missiles or anything?
[02:18:04.892 --> 02:18:05.112]  No!
[02:18:05.953 --> 02:18:22.541]  You jack up the prices because if there's no supply, the people that own, like you and me, or hedge funds, or countries, like what China is now doing, encouraging every single one of their citizens to buy silver instead of gold, they know that... Well, we should have started that.
[02:18:22.561 --> 02:18:23.201]  That's in the news.
[02:18:23.281 --> 02:18:25.022]  China tells citizens to buy silver.
[02:18:25.303 --> 02:18:25.903]  What is that about?
[02:18:27.088 --> 02:18:41.918]  So this goes back to the day before, actually it was the last time I was on the show, it was the day that Iran was firing those stupid drones at Israel.
[02:18:42.598 --> 02:18:49.523]  So the day before that, the Western banks had shorted 1.2 billion ounces of silver.
[02:18:50.303 --> 02:18:51.384]  1.2 billion.
[02:18:52.024 --> 02:18:57.706]  So there's only 800 million ounces of silver mined in the entire world in a whole year.
[02:18:57.746 --> 02:18:59.347]  So they shorted way more than exists.
[02:18:59.427 --> 02:19:04.269]  Yeah, they shorted 50% more than the global mining production of silver in one afternoon.
[02:19:04.649 --> 02:19:05.669]  So what did China do?
[02:19:05.729 --> 02:19:06.530]  China says, hmm.
[02:19:07.310 --> 02:19:09.352]  We want to be the world's reserve currency.
[02:19:09.432 --> 02:19:10.733]  We want to destroy the West.
[02:19:10.793 --> 02:19:12.815]  We want to destroy the Western banking system.
[02:19:13.216 --> 02:19:23.326]  So in one fell swoop, when they shot off those drones, which literally Alex, everybody knew that those stupid low-flying, slow-flying drones with lights on them were going to be shot out of the sky.
[02:19:24.086 --> 02:19:31.694]  So, but it created fear because after that, and I was, we were watching it on TV and watching these things go and, you know, the narrative after that was,
[02:19:32.194 --> 02:19:35.156]  Okay, we're going to attack Israeli and U.S.
[02:19:35.196 --> 02:19:36.276]  targets all over the world.
[02:19:36.296 --> 02:19:37.717]  80 mile an hour paper airplanes.
[02:19:37.737 --> 02:19:37.937]  Yeah.
[02:19:38.438 --> 02:19:41.600]  It's fear, fear, fear was just instilled in the hearts and minds of people.
[02:19:41.640 --> 02:19:49.124]  So if you want to destroy a civilization, A, you create fear, and B, you destroy their banks and people's access to money.
[02:19:49.544 --> 02:19:59.270]  So I think what China is doing is they are planning on winning this battle against America without ever firing a bullet, because if they can entice
[02:19:59.910 --> 02:20:04.194]  Every one of their citizens to buy just one ounce of silver, there's over a billion people there.
[02:20:04.214 --> 02:20:05.255]  That'll stop the shorters.
[02:20:05.395 --> 02:20:13.202]  Yeah, but they don't even have to do that much because in 2024, India has already committed to 66% of the global supply.
[02:20:13.222 --> 02:20:16.825]  Sure, so there's already a run on silver and China's calling the bluff with the naked shorters.
[02:20:17.245 --> 02:20:19.666]  Yeah, so explain that to people that don't do that.
[02:20:20.127 --> 02:20:24.489]  So a naked short means you sell something that you don't have.
[02:20:24.989 --> 02:20:27.271]  I mean, we can't do that, but central banks can.
[02:20:27.351 --> 02:20:30.052]  So they're selling naked shorts.
[02:20:30.132 --> 02:20:31.833]  So look at this.
[02:20:34.094 --> 02:20:36.856]  Commitment of Traders Silver Report from May 10th.
[02:20:37.016 --> 02:20:39.677]  That was just like yesterday or something like that.
[02:20:41.497 --> 02:20:50.344]  This report shows how many short positions commercially and basically from speculators there is.
[02:20:50.865 --> 02:21:01.213]  So you add all of this up, the number of short positions by the commercial criminal banksters is 568.2 million ounces of silver that are short.
[02:21:05.316 --> 02:21:13.055]  So clearly naked shorts and I would say as early as next week and any time after that
[02:21:14.013 --> 02:21:38.910]  These shorts could be killed, and what China wants to do is they could win an economic battle against America, dethrone our dollar by killing the Western banking system, and they do that by enticing their citizens to buy silver, the rest of the world to buy silver, because when you have all those short positions, you're expecting the price to go down for the reasons we talked about, needed for defense and everything else.
[02:21:39.210 --> 02:21:42.332]  Sure, so obviously, how do the globals come in and try to block that now?
[02:21:44.318 --> 02:21:48.122]  Well, I don't know if they can actually do that right now.
[02:21:48.162 --> 02:21:49.523]  Wait a minute, is there some mechanism?
[02:21:50.184 --> 02:21:52.406]  When a naked short gets called by a government, what do they do?
[02:21:53.307 --> 02:21:56.270]  Well, when it's called, they have to pay up.
[02:21:57.211 --> 02:21:58.533]  So, China knows this.
[02:21:59.033 --> 02:22:01.976]  And so, I think what's going to happen, so you could default.
[02:22:02.887 --> 02:22:05.508]  Or you could print money to try to bail it out.
[02:22:05.588 --> 02:22:06.569]  I mean, those are the two things.
[02:22:07.009 --> 02:22:11.791]  If you default, there's political ramifications of that, because who owns our treasuries?
[02:22:12.651 --> 02:22:15.152]  Like, China still has almost a trillion dollars worth of them.
[02:22:15.793 --> 02:22:23.396]  So that's just like stealing money out of their wallets, and they're going to get ticked, and that starts to create geopolitical conflict and even intensifying the war.
[02:22:23.896 --> 02:22:25.757]  But the media will call it a sanction.
[02:22:26.097 --> 02:22:28.558]  So if they have to now steal the Chinese money, they'll call it a sanction or something.
[02:22:28.578 --> 02:22:29.779]  Yeah, they would call it a sanction.
[02:22:29.859 --> 02:22:42.269]  I mean, just like when Biden froze Russia's assets after the Russia-Ukraine war started, I mean, they couldn't access them and they said, oh, we have to do that because we have to stop this evil Russia from invading Ukraine.
[02:22:42.890 --> 02:22:44.811]  And so they froze their assets.
[02:22:44.831 --> 02:22:48.615]  So you could try to freeze assets by putting sanctions on them.
[02:22:49.055 --> 02:22:53.278]  You could actually default, which would have major geopolitical ramifications.
[02:22:54.239 --> 02:23:01.084]  Or you could just print money, which there's probably going to be the result as they just try to inflate their way out of it.
[02:23:01.424 --> 02:23:04.826]  How do you square up Keely Unlimited with interest rate hikes coming?
[02:23:05.727 --> 02:23:21.337]  So we're now seeing that battle with the Fed and that the federal presidents of all the different regional Federal Reserve banks have now deviated from what Jerome Powell has been talking about of we got to lower interest rates.
[02:23:21.357 --> 02:23:21.898]  We're going to lower it.
[02:23:21.938 --> 02:23:23.038]  We've won this battle again.
[02:23:23.058 --> 02:23:23.719]  You've got the floor.
[02:23:24.680 --> 02:23:27.262]  I've been asked that today.
[02:23:27.282 --> 02:23:34.950]  Yeah, you've got all these regional banks that aren't the real Federal Reserve, but you have the local control fighting with the real Federal Reserve of New York.
[02:23:35.571 --> 02:23:36.912]  Folks, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:23:36.932 --> 02:23:39.194]  I don't know how to explain how bonkers this is.
[02:23:39.254 --> 02:23:43.619]  I'm not an economist like you, but studying this for 30 years on air, this is unprecedented.
[02:23:43.919 --> 02:23:49.042]  Well, so, when you've got the Federal Reserve Presidents, they're the ones that are voting.
[02:23:49.563 --> 02:23:53.205]  It's not just Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Fed, that has one singular vote.
[02:23:53.265 --> 02:23:57.028]  No, the Board of Governors actually votes for policy.
[02:23:57.668 --> 02:24:08.656]  So, the narrative is changing from, hey, we're going to have 7 to 8 rate reductions, to 5 to 6, to 2 to 3, to maybe just 1 right before the election so we can show that we're winning.
[02:24:09.276 --> 02:24:20.107]  However, you've got now the Federal Reserve Presidents, which are trying to save face, saying that we are smart economists here, we can't actually have a rate reduction at all.
[02:24:20.548 --> 02:24:24.391]  In fact, we're probably going to have to have a rate increase.
[02:24:26.053 --> 02:24:27.874]  Why would you have to have a rate increase?
[02:24:28.535 --> 02:24:31.357]  You increase rates to slow down inflation.
[02:24:31.737 --> 02:24:33.438]  So this is the problem that we're seeing.
[02:24:33.738 --> 02:24:40.242]  I think that the Fed knows that there is a major financial battle starting to be waged here.
[02:24:40.803 --> 02:24:43.505]  It's an attack from China against the U.S.
[02:24:43.585 --> 02:24:48.808]  banks to dethrone their dominance, to actually get them to run out of money.
[02:24:49.308 --> 02:24:54.792]  And you could actually start to win an economic battle if you cause them to be undercapitalized
[02:24:54.952 --> 02:25:05.035]  Pay off all these short positions, and there's 568 million plus ounces of silver in short right now.
[02:25:05.835 --> 02:25:06.956]  In a short position!
[02:25:07.476 --> 02:25:17.139]  So, that's why I think as early as next week, some of these shorts would have to be unraveled, and I think what that's going to do to the price of silver, it's going to go up and up and up, and what did China just do?
[02:25:17.819 --> 02:25:20.700]  They just squeezed the U.S.
[02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:22.761]  banking system out of silver.
[02:25:22.781 --> 02:25:26.122]  But we go back to what the Fed is going to have to try to do.
[02:25:26.622 --> 02:25:28.063]  Are they going to bail out the banks?
[02:25:28.203 --> 02:25:35.426]  Well, they already said they didn't want to because they already legislated bail-ins and they want the depositors to bail out their own banks.
[02:25:36.366 --> 02:25:38.688]  So that's what a bail-in is versus a bail-out.
[02:25:38.748 --> 02:25:41.411]  A bail-out means the federal government's going to bail everybody out.
[02:25:41.531 --> 02:25:44.774]  A bail-in means you bail out your own financial institution.
[02:25:45.515 --> 02:25:54.964]  But I think it gets so bad, Alex, that when we look at what's coming next, they're going to be forced to print their way out of everything.
[02:25:55.959 --> 02:26:04.986]  Everything, because it's like this culmination of a perfect economic storm where banks are running out of money, politically things are in upheaval.
[02:26:05.646 --> 02:26:06.767]  Biden is lying.
[02:26:06.807 --> 02:26:14.472]  Like we talked about on the last show, Biden says inflation was 9% when I took office, and so technically it's lower now I'm winning.
[02:26:14.512 --> 02:26:16.054]  It's like, dude, you're lying.
[02:26:16.654 --> 02:26:17.094]  You're lying.
[02:26:17.535 --> 02:26:20.597]  Inflation when Trump left was officially at 1.4%.
[02:26:21.197 --> 02:26:22.418]  I think that's understated too.
[02:26:25.180 --> 02:26:39.413]  If it was at 1.4 and now they have these bogus numbers that they are, nobody believes for a second, Alex, that Biden is telling the truth on inflation when eggs have tripled or quadrupled in price.
[02:26:39.833 --> 02:26:44.997]  He just said Wednesday that inflation was higher under Trump, but it's 9 plus percent under him.
[02:26:45.017 --> 02:26:46.719]  It was 1.5 when it was under Trump.
[02:26:47.039 --> 02:26:49.661]  I mean, he's literally saying whales fly in the sky.
[02:26:50.646 --> 02:26:54.427]  Yeah, I mean, nobody that actually goes to the grocery store believes any of that nonsense.
[02:26:54.567 --> 02:26:57.028]  All right, I want to take a break, because this is so important, what you mentioned.
[02:26:57.068 --> 02:26:58.969]  I'm glad you reminded me, because I had the clip 30 months ago.
[02:26:59.489 --> 02:27:07.491]  Here is last year, the FDIC board meeting, where they're saying, we're going to have to have bail-ins, but we can't tell the public.
[02:27:07.511 --> 02:27:11.253]  Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this on video, because it's all public records.
[02:27:11.473 --> 02:27:13.253]  This is actually a federal agency, like the Federal Reserve.
[02:27:13.853 --> 02:27:14.794]  We'll play this clip.
[02:27:15.954 --> 02:27:17.935]  We're going to play a John Bowne report, so we can both take a break.
[02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:19.080]  I don't know.
[02:27:37.290 --> 02:27:41.774]  But I was literally trying to get him on as a guest, and I was like, well, why aren't we were trying to talk to you?
[02:27:42.334 --> 02:27:45.797]  You need to go to KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:27:45.917 --> 02:27:46.597]  Is it perfect?
[02:27:46.637 --> 02:27:47.478]  No, only God's perfect.
[02:27:47.978 --> 02:27:51.421]  But I only promote what I feel good about.
[02:27:51.481 --> 02:27:52.902]  And I've been on there 30 years, folks.
[02:27:53.282 --> 02:27:55.444]  You know, 98% of what we say happens, OK?
[02:27:55.724 --> 02:27:58.186]  I make mistakes, but there's no perfect thing.
[02:27:58.246 --> 02:28:00.968]  But I feel good telling you to get gold and silver.
[02:28:01.369 --> 02:28:02.970]  I wish I had money to be getting it myself.
[02:28:04.898 --> 02:28:07.319]  I've told my family in the last six months he's been a sponsor.
[02:28:07.419 --> 02:28:07.679]  Go!
[02:28:07.759 --> 02:28:08.619]  They've been doing it.
[02:28:09.260 --> 02:28:12.641]  You need to go to KEPM.com, Forged by Gold.
[02:28:13.221 --> 02:28:13.961]  They're really busy.
[02:28:13.981 --> 02:28:15.922]  They'll give you a call six hours a day, whatever.
[02:28:16.542 --> 02:28:17.623]  He's trying to get more crew in.
[02:28:18.063 --> 02:28:19.283]  It's exploding, obviously.
[02:28:20.344 --> 02:28:21.744]  You need to get gold and silver.
[02:28:21.844 --> 02:28:24.685]  You need to get it now, in my view.
[02:28:25.566 --> 02:28:27.246]  That doesn't mean a huge part.
[02:28:27.286 --> 02:28:30.688]  Whatever your portfolio is, just you need to start sticking your toe in it.
[02:28:30.808 --> 02:28:32.328]  And people that are smart are going all the way in.
[02:28:34.980 --> 02:28:39.444]  My firm belief, and who knows, they may do some giant naked short and drive it down 20%.
[02:28:40.185 --> 02:28:42.847]  It'll go bloop, I believe 100% back over that.
[02:28:43.188 --> 02:28:45.330]  I mean, we are in an inflationary spiral.
[02:28:46.231 --> 02:28:52.677]  My whole gut, my whole intellect says get into it, but then I can't ever do it because the companies are a bunch of frickin' sharks like everything else.
[02:28:52.737 --> 02:28:53.537]  This guy's not.
[02:28:54.318 --> 02:29:09.230]  Go to him, I love this guy, go to KEPM.com forward slash gold, or you can call 720-605-3900, do a consultation, tell him your needs, talk to him, and at least stick your toe in today.
[02:29:09.270 --> 02:29:16.896]  Don't screw around, don't wait, that's my opinion, I'm not telling you what to do, but I, on my children, feel this is one of the best moves you can do.
[02:29:17.256 --> 02:29:20.679]  You should also, if you don't have a gun, get a gun, get a gun safety course.
[02:29:21.099 --> 02:29:21.880]  Learn how to use it.
[02:29:22.180 --> 02:29:23.000]  Get a water filtration.
[02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:24.141]  Get some extra storable food.
[02:29:24.521 --> 02:29:33.766]  More importantly than getting gold or silver from Dr. Kirk Elliott, you better get on your knees to the founder of the creator of the universe and say, I can't handle this.
[02:29:33.946 --> 02:29:34.586]  I need you.
[02:29:34.927 --> 02:29:35.967]  You're a god of free will.
[02:29:36.187 --> 02:29:36.748]  I love you.
[02:29:37.108 --> 02:29:38.729]  Please come into me and tell me what to do.
[02:29:39.089 --> 02:29:42.631]  That gold doesn't even, it's not even 1% of a trillion.
[02:29:43.422 --> 02:29:43.822]  We're good to go!
[02:30:03.220 --> 02:30:14.004]  Get guns, get some food, get some water filtration, get ready and get gold and silver and get it from trusted people now at KEPM.com forward slash gold or the phone number on the screen.
[02:30:15.205 --> 02:30:18.046]  I'll never steer you wrong, folks, but I make mistakes every once in a while.
[02:30:18.306 --> 02:30:20.307]  I don't think you think I'm making a mistake here.
[02:30:20.627 --> 02:30:22.007]  You know in your gut, you can see it.
[02:30:22.207 --> 02:30:23.188]  You need gold and silver now.
[02:30:23.428 --> 02:30:23.948]  Go there now.
[02:30:24.088 --> 02:30:26.669]  And they finance this operation, which is wrecking the enemy.
[02:30:26.849 --> 02:30:27.489]  We'll be right back.
[02:30:27.729 --> 02:30:31.391]  Here is the clip of the incredible statement.
[02:30:33.096 --> 02:30:40.640]  It's a little bit conflicted, right?
[02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:47.144]  I mean, it's important that people understand they can be bailed in, but you don't want a huge run on the institution.
[02:30:47.244 --> 02:30:49.125]  But, I mean, they're going to be.
[02:30:49.525 --> 02:30:58.249]  And it could be an early warning signal to the FDIC and the primary regulators when these things happen.
[02:30:58.289 --> 02:30:59.470]  And there may be some other
[02:31:00.390 --> 02:31:12.978]  Prices, this is similar to what Jay was saying, in the market that you can tell whether people understand who's going to be protected, who isn't going to be protected.
[02:31:12.998 --> 02:31:15.320]  Because they own this fucking place.
[02:31:15.600 --> 02:31:18.522]  It's a big club and you ain't in it.
[02:31:19.803 --> 02:31:22.544]  You and I are not in the big club.
[02:31:22.564 --> 02:31:25.906]  I completely agree with that.
[02:31:26.267 --> 02:31:28.168]  I almost think you'd scare the public.
[02:31:29.079 --> 02:31:31.421]  If you put this out, why are they telling me this?
[02:31:31.841 --> 02:31:33.503]  Should I be concerned about my bank?
[02:31:34.964 --> 02:31:42.210]  If my insurance company doesn't tell me what they're doing with my assets, they just assume they're going to pay my claim.
[02:31:42.490 --> 02:31:42.931]  Right?
[02:31:43.231 --> 02:31:52.679]  I think you've got to think of the unintended consequences of taking a public that has more full faith and confidence in the banking system than maybe people in this room do.
[02:31:55.197 --> 02:31:57.319]  We want them to have full faith and confidence in the banking system.
[02:31:57.379 --> 02:31:59.040]  They know the FDIC insurance is there.
[02:31:59.120 --> 02:31:59.800]  They know it works.
[02:31:59.960 --> 02:32:00.581]  They put their money in.
[02:32:00.601 --> 02:32:01.581]  They're going to get their money out.
[02:32:02.422 --> 02:32:07.666]  So there's a select crowd of people that are on the institutional side.
[02:32:07.686 --> 02:32:11.188]  And if they want to understand this, they're going to find a way to understand this.
[02:32:11.288 --> 02:32:13.069]  There's a bunch of law firms represented in this room.
[02:32:13.089 --> 02:32:16.772]  There's a bunch of people that will charge them by the hour a lot of money to explain this all to them.
[02:32:17.312 --> 02:32:18.453]  And it's fine.
[02:32:18.793 --> 02:32:19.914]  I don't have a problem with that.
[02:32:20.492 --> 02:32:21.572]  And they all have huge staffs.
[02:32:22.092 --> 02:32:30.494]  But I would be careful about the unintended consequences of starting to blast too much of this out in the general public.
[02:32:32.255 --> 02:32:36.896]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[02:32:37.276 --> 02:32:38.917]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[02:32:39.177 --> 02:32:40.157]  They deserve to be heard.
[02:32:40.177 --> 02:32:41.977]  They deserve to be heard.
[02:32:42.257 --> 02:32:44.298]  Biden gets rid of the border three and a half years ago.
[02:32:45.400 --> 02:32:47.722]  20 million people are here, that's the real number, 22 million.
[02:32:48.563 --> 02:32:50.885]  They're slaves of the globalists, new permanent underclass.
[02:32:51.545 --> 02:32:53.947]  He tells them immediately, surge the border if he wins, they get here.
[02:32:54.347 --> 02:32:55.588]  He says, oh, the border's not broken.
[02:32:55.608 --> 02:32:57.850]  He says, oh, it is broken, pass amnesty.
[02:32:58.311 --> 02:33:02.014]  And then yesterday he comes out and says, oh, we can't have it illegal to come here.
[02:33:02.034 --> 02:33:03.735]  It's moral, this is totally open.
[02:33:03.995 --> 02:33:08.779]  Imagine a kid two years old saying, mom, don't take me across Rio Grande, it's against the law.
[02:33:09.239 --> 02:33:09.920]  Give me a break.
[02:33:10.552 --> 02:33:11.973]  These have been model citizens.
[02:33:12.493 --> 02:33:19.138]  Imagine telling a kid it's illegal to come across the border, which it is, which he's made legal by Fiat, and they're model citizens.
[02:33:19.178 --> 02:33:21.439]  They're citizens the minute they get here.
[02:33:21.760 --> 02:33:28.664]  Do you think there are people that are coming over that have the intent to do our neighbors, our friends, our family members harm?
[02:33:29.285 --> 02:33:29.925]  Absolutely.
[02:33:31.546 --> 02:33:39.792]  These huge give up groups that we're getting, you know, the media is only reporting what
[02:33:41.241 --> 02:33:49.503]  They can report on rape, which is statistically speaking a small percentage of the actual bad guys that we're catching.
[02:33:49.783 --> 02:33:51.624]  No one is coming to protect you.
[02:33:52.304 --> 02:33:56.385]  Even at the local law enforcement level, we do not control the border.
[02:33:56.945 --> 02:33:58.645]  The cartel controls the border.
[02:33:59.606 --> 02:34:05.207]  Everything that we do is a reaction to things that they have planned.
[02:34:06.993 --> 02:34:13.696]  Usually we're chasing around pawns while the kings and queens are doing whatever they want.
[02:34:13.976 --> 02:34:19.118]  Think about the magnitude of what he just said, the lawlessness of it.
[02:34:19.439 --> 02:34:26.822]  They're going to grab your junk, they're going to search your family, they're going to put you through a body scanner at the airport, but the border is wide open.
[02:34:27.142 --> 02:34:28.603]  Absolutely insane.
[02:34:29.103 --> 02:34:31.324]  They stole the election three and a half years ago.
[02:34:32.424 --> 02:34:33.685]  They're planning to steal it again.
[02:34:35.427 --> 02:34:38.950]  Does the investigation confirm that there are missing ballot images?
[02:34:41.892 --> 02:34:43.153]  Yes.
[02:34:43.213 --> 02:34:43.553]  Yes.
[02:34:43.633 --> 02:34:50.578]  Do you know why 380,761 ballot images from Election Day machine count are not available?
[02:34:51.819 --> 02:34:52.720]  Those are for the recount.
[02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:54.321]  Those are from the recount.
[02:34:54.341 --> 02:34:59.385]  But we have no ballot images for 380,761 ballots from Election Day, correct?
[02:35:05.717 --> 02:35:11.939]  What was subpoenaed was the ballot images for the recount because that's what this case was about, not the election day.
[02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:16.501]  Does Fulton County know why there are not 380,761 ballot images from Election Day?
[02:35:22.478 --> 02:35:38.667]  According to news sources, a Wisconsin government employee has been fired from her government job for helping to rig the 2020 presidential election in Joe Biden's favor.
[02:35:39.447 --> 02:35:45.731]  We have a documented email from one of her coworkers by the name of Ryan Chu.
[02:35:45.911 --> 02:35:48.232]  He wrote on November 4th at 4.07 AM.
[02:35:50.333 --> 02:35:58.141]  Damn Claire, you have a flair for drama, delivering just the margin needed at 3 a.m.
[02:35:58.821 --> 02:36:03.366]  I bet you had those votes counted at midnight and just wanted to keep the world waiting.
[02:36:16.633 --> 02:36:21.776]  Now if you're interested in learning more about hosting a migrant family, all you got to do is take out your phone, dial 211.
[02:36:22.356 --> 02:36:23.337]  It's as easy as that.
[02:36:23.357 --> 02:36:24.677]  You're going to be asked a few questions.
[02:36:25.178 --> 02:36:30.340]  Things along the lines of how long are you able to host somebody, what kind of space are you available to provide.
[02:36:30.620 --> 02:36:33.182]  These are the times that try men and women's souls.
[02:36:34.335 --> 02:36:35.996]  But, this is the last gasp.
[02:36:36.116 --> 02:36:39.117]  All over the world, 83% was the number I saw last week.
[02:36:39.517 --> 02:36:41.498]  In regional, local, national elections.
[02:36:41.798 --> 02:36:46.020]  From Australia, to El Salvador, to you name it.
[02:36:46.820 --> 02:36:48.801]  Europe, patriots are getting elected.
[02:36:48.861 --> 02:36:54.983]  That's why the system is so scared.
[02:36:56.224 --> 02:36:59.625]  Myself and Dr. Kirk Elliott are not here telling you what's coming.
[02:36:59.725 --> 02:37:01.466]  It's already going down.
[02:37:03.220 --> 02:37:04.521]  Yeah, right with God first, folks.
[02:37:04.901 --> 02:37:07.103]  And take the border piece we just played.
[02:37:07.583 --> 02:37:08.784]  Part of it, the computer glitched out.
[02:37:09.424 --> 02:37:10.725]  But the whole thing's a band-off.
[02:37:10.865 --> 02:37:16.509]  You know, InfoWars.com and RealAlexJones on X. Congress, the Democrats voted.
[02:37:17.813 --> 02:37:23.335]  To not stop illegals from voting or apportioning them for the Electoral College.
[02:37:24.035 --> 02:37:30.117]  As they bring in, you know, 20-something million since Biden's in, that in the new census will be counted as new blue districts.
[02:37:30.917 --> 02:37:35.338]  So, and the border is not controlled by the cartels.
[02:37:35.818 --> 02:37:37.119]  They're working with the CIA.
[02:37:37.819 --> 02:37:40.300]  It came out decades ago that the CIA was controlling the cartels.
[02:37:40.340 --> 02:37:42.841]  When they got out of line, they'd go kill them or use another cartel.
[02:37:43.381 --> 02:37:47.102]  So to try to explain to people how big a deal this is,
[02:37:48.903 --> 02:37:52.225]  There's really not words for me to describe to you.
[02:37:54.026 --> 02:37:55.787]  And you don't need me to tell you how big a deal this is.
[02:37:55.907 --> 02:37:56.967]  But here's the bottom line.
[02:37:57.488 --> 02:37:58.448]  We're in a war.
[02:37:58.488 --> 02:38:05.292]  There's a war against civilization, a war against your wealth, a war against your health, a war against your spirit, a war against your future.
[02:38:05.772 --> 02:38:07.293]  Recognize the war is here.
[02:38:07.353 --> 02:38:08.994]  And I know people tune in here because you get that.
[02:38:09.274 --> 02:38:10.295]  Well, you got to tell the people.
[02:38:10.815 --> 02:38:13.157]  Because as things get more intense, they're ready to hear the truth now.
[02:38:13.557 --> 02:38:16.879]  So to Kirk Elliott, you're just watching that border clip and other key points you've got.
[02:38:19.364 --> 02:38:25.025]  So there's an obvious battle economically between the BRICS nations and us.
[02:38:25.646 --> 02:38:27.306]  They want to be the world's reserve currency.
[02:38:27.446 --> 02:38:34.988]  So in Russia, this again I got from silverwars.org.
[02:38:35.088 --> 02:38:38.129]  So this is a great piece that they wrote.
[02:38:38.669 --> 02:38:42.190]  There's an economist in Russia named Sergei Glazyev.
[02:38:42.830 --> 02:38:46.351]  So he proposed pegging the price of one gram of gold
[02:38:47.171 --> 02:38:47.331]  I think.
[02:39:05.051 --> 02:39:08.453]  When I think about this, it's like, oh my word, Alex, this is brilliant.
[02:39:08.954 --> 02:39:17.880]  Because A, they got rid of the petrodollar, and now they're going to peg the one gram of gold to a barrel of oil.
[02:39:18.500 --> 02:39:21.082]  So what has happened in the United States?
[02:39:21.142 --> 02:39:27.266]  Well, over the last few years, Biden has eliminated the Strategic Oil Reserve.
[02:39:27.286 --> 02:39:28.387]  Like, it's depleted.
[02:39:28.507 --> 02:39:29.247]  It's gone.
[02:39:29.647 --> 02:39:34.531]  So they now have to replenish the Strategic Oil Reserve in America.
[02:39:35.511 --> 02:39:44.154]  If they have to use any Russian oil to actually do that, it's going to be pegged to gold instead of the U.S.
[02:39:44.214 --> 02:39:44.534]  dollar.
[02:39:44.574 --> 02:39:49.996]  This is going to dethrone, potentially, because realize the implications of this.
[02:39:50.557 --> 02:39:55.318]  The BRICS++ nations are literally about 70% of the world's population.
[02:39:55.378 --> 02:39:56.919]  It's not just a country.
[02:39:57.739 --> 02:40:02.181]  This is big deal that they're going to peg oil to gold.
[02:40:02.601 --> 02:40:07.503]  Now, if they really wanted to stick it to the West, what could they do?
[02:40:08.064 --> 02:40:08.924]  Change the peg.
[02:40:09.404 --> 02:40:15.267]  So instead of one gram of gold for one barrel of oil, what if they say one gram equals two barrels of oil?
[02:40:16.047 --> 02:40:17.709]  Well, what does that do to the price of gold?
[02:40:18.650 --> 02:40:23.335]  That would put it at about $3,200 an ounce, or $3,600 an ounce.
[02:40:23.895 --> 02:40:30.022]  So that's what this guy, the Credit Suisse guy, Pozar, said.
[02:40:30.122 --> 02:40:36.709]  Credit Suisse analyzes that if they did that, the potential would put gold at $3,600 an ounce.
[02:40:39.505 --> 02:40:41.186]  So why would they want to do that?
[02:40:41.706 --> 02:40:50.251]  Because what China has done over the years is they have been the number one miner of gold in the world.
[02:40:50.591 --> 02:40:53.352]  They mine more gold out of the earth than any country in the world.
[02:40:53.733 --> 02:40:54.933]  How much of that do they sell?
[02:40:55.734 --> 02:40:56.214]  Zero.
[02:40:56.614 --> 02:40:57.375]  They keep it all.
[02:40:58.075 --> 02:41:01.840]  They're also the number one purchaser of gold on the planet.
[02:41:02.301 --> 02:41:04.744]  So they're amassing mountains and mountains and mountains of gold.
[02:41:04.784 --> 02:41:07.708]  They're the number one producer of gold and they're not selling any of it.
[02:41:08.369 --> 02:41:12.254]  So the unofficial estimates are they've got about 30,000 tons of gold in China.
[02:41:14.056 --> 02:41:23.099]  Now, Russia has like 1,000 tons, India has 600 or so tons, but officially the World Gold Council I think says that China has about 5,000 tons.
[02:41:23.159 --> 02:41:24.360]  No, they have way more than that.
[02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:30.242]  So, if this peg of pegging one gram of gold to one barrel of oil,
[02:41:30.862 --> 02:41:34.705]  All they have to do is change the peg to two barrels of oil for one gram of gold.
[02:41:35.145 --> 02:41:37.347]  That puts gold at $3,600 an ounce.
[02:41:37.827 --> 02:41:41.610]  China owns tens of thousands of tons of gold.
[02:41:42.251 --> 02:41:51.938]  This, Alex, is the paradigm tectonic shifting moment that puts gold as the legitimate currency of the world.
[02:41:51.978 --> 02:41:55.300]  And Dr. Elliott, I'm not a rocket scientist, but I remember the globalists invading
[02:41:56.481 --> 02:41:56.762]  I don't.
[02:42:20.376 --> 02:42:21.076]  I kind of can.
[02:42:21.316 --> 02:42:22.157]  They're just arrogant.
[02:42:22.477 --> 02:42:23.417]  They're just arrogant.
[02:42:23.837 --> 02:42:25.778]  I mean, it's absolutely arrogance.
[02:42:25.878 --> 02:42:28.359]  And what does the Bible tell us about arrogance?
[02:42:28.459 --> 02:42:29.679]  Pride comes before the fall.
[02:42:29.739 --> 02:42:30.979]  Fool goes before the fool.
[02:42:31.239 --> 02:42:31.419]  Yeah.
[02:42:31.940 --> 02:42:33.500]  And I think that's what's happening there.
[02:42:33.620 --> 02:42:35.461]  Arrogance has finally got the best of them.
[02:42:36.101 --> 02:42:39.162]  That's what's crazy is I've got more power in my life.
[02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:45.162]  I realize my mistakes are bigger, because even if it's a small mistake, it has a bigger effect.
[02:42:45.462 --> 02:42:46.963]  But I see this paradox in other people.
[02:42:47.243 --> 02:42:48.944]  They get power, they get delusional.
[02:42:49.844 --> 02:42:50.665]  Power is dangerous.
[02:42:50.905 --> 02:42:52.786]  I had a jet ski that would go 70 miles an hour.
[02:42:53.326 --> 02:42:54.246]  I sold it.
[02:42:54.347 --> 02:42:54.987]  It was so dangerous.
[02:42:56.453 --> 02:42:57.074]  I don't think so.
[02:43:12.321 --> 02:43:16.104]  When they want absolute power over every factor of our life, this is what they're going to.
[02:43:16.484 --> 02:43:18.926]  But to me, God's Word always remains true.
[02:43:18.986 --> 02:43:20.267]  It never returns void.
[02:43:20.688 --> 02:43:24.611]  And that power, that pride, will actually ultimately be their destruction.
[02:43:24.951 --> 02:43:31.076]  But if you look at what else they're doing, so Russia, China, India, the Arab world, most of Africa and Latin America,
[02:43:31.696 --> 02:43:35.419]  They outfoxed the Federal Reserve because what are they doing?
[02:43:35.679 --> 02:43:45.806]  They're actually starting to open up new massive mines in Africa, I think in Ghana maybe, where they're going to actually start to mine their own gold.
[02:43:46.227 --> 02:43:49.149]  They want to have a BRICS nation.
[02:43:49.209 --> 02:43:51.491]  Well China already has 98% control of rare earth minerals.
[02:43:52.091 --> 02:43:52.511]  Already.
[02:43:52.571 --> 02:43:54.413]  Why did the United States allow that again?
[02:43:54.733 --> 02:43:55.833]  They block any U.S.
[02:43:55.873 --> 02:43:57.675]  company or European company that tries to get into it.
[02:43:58.055 --> 02:44:02.137]  That was the old deal before Xi Jinping broke the deal with Obama ten years ago.
[02:44:02.698 --> 02:44:04.239]  They've been set up as the powerhouse.
[02:44:04.799 --> 02:44:05.660]  And then they double crossed.
[02:44:07.394 --> 02:44:08.335]  Absolutely double-crossed.
[02:44:08.375 --> 02:44:16.800]  And so now that they own the gold, they actually own the power, they're owning the wealth, they got rid of the petrodollar, they're dismantling the U.S.
[02:44:16.860 --> 02:44:17.180]  dollar.
[02:44:17.740 --> 02:44:19.161]  And what did Putin say six years ago?
[02:44:19.181 --> 02:44:23.143]  He says, our new national initiative is not weapons, it's organic food.
[02:44:23.564 --> 02:44:25.765]  The West, he said, is producing poison food.
[02:44:26.085 --> 02:44:27.926]  We will supply the world with non-GMO.
[02:44:28.386 --> 02:44:30.608]  They're even seeing that trend.
[02:44:30.808 --> 02:44:33.069]  All of these trends are playing against us.
[02:44:33.289 --> 02:44:36.151]  Meanwhile, Bill Gates is buying up all our farmland to feed his poison.
[02:44:37.774 --> 02:44:39.741]  So Putin, say what you want, I'll be honest.
[02:44:40.203 --> 02:44:41.186]  He's bad on humanity.
[02:44:41.808 --> 02:44:42.952]  He's paying people to have kids.
[02:44:43.273 --> 02:44:44.397]  He's growing organic farms.
[02:44:46.504 --> 02:44:51.307]  He's actually playing a masterful game, and Biden is not.
[02:44:51.807 --> 02:44:53.148]  It's absolutely the opposite.
[02:44:53.168 --> 02:44:55.869]  Well, if you know the globalist game, it's easy to beat if you just do it.
[02:44:56.370 --> 02:44:58.651]  Like, people want prosperity and freedom and good food.
[02:44:58.911 --> 02:45:00.952]  Yeah, they do.
[02:45:01.332 --> 02:45:07.936]  And so now I think there's a new central bank that's about to emerge, and that's the BRICS central bank.
[02:45:08.716 --> 02:45:16.819]  They want to issue their own native currency, so forget about the yuan, forget about the rupee and the ruble.
[02:45:17.260 --> 02:45:28.884]  They want their own BRICS native currency, and what China and Russia are pushing for is a gold-backed currency to push demand into their central bank digital currency.
[02:45:28.964 --> 02:45:30.445]  Here's the danger of that.
[02:45:31.245 --> 02:45:32.926]  For any central bank digital currency,
[02:45:34.026 --> 02:45:37.390]  Once you go in that door, you're not coming out, Alex.
[02:45:37.410 --> 02:45:37.850]  No, I agree.
[02:45:37.890 --> 02:45:38.711]  It's like the Ring of Mordor.
[02:45:38.751 --> 02:45:39.452]  You shouldn't use it.
[02:45:39.712 --> 02:45:40.373]  Yeah, you shouldn't.
[02:45:40.393 --> 02:45:42.095]  I'm going to break some news here I haven't broke yet.
[02:45:42.215 --> 02:45:50.083]  I got invited by Putin, official letterhead, next month to be at his big, you know, global ruse economic forum.
[02:45:50.563 --> 02:45:53.887]  It's the biggest thing he does and I respect that and I want to go.
[02:45:54.407 --> 02:45:56.909]  But they're trying that month, next month, to shut this down.
[02:45:57.270 --> 02:45:58.311]  And I'll just be honest with listeners.
[02:45:58.671 --> 02:46:04.016]  People hear me say this and they think, oh, InfoWars has been around 27 years, Jones has been on there 30, come on.
[02:46:04.876 --> 02:46:17.007]  There's a 50% chance, I've told the crew this, that a judge on June 14th at a meeting in South Texas, Houston, is going to liquidate InfoWars.
[02:46:17.773 --> 02:46:24.155]  All right, and next week I'll do a whole hour on this, because I've got all my ducks in a row, but I've got all the documents.
[02:46:24.195 --> 02:46:26.015]  I want to really nail this, because this is a big deal.
[02:46:26.295 --> 02:46:27.396]  This is a historic operation.
[02:46:27.476 --> 02:46:29.276]  Obviously, I'll continue on air.
[02:46:29.716 --> 02:46:30.616]  It hurts the crew.
[02:46:30.756 --> 02:46:34.257]  I'm going to try to work something out, but I've been very honest about this.
[02:46:34.317 --> 02:46:35.838]  I've not gone out and got other opportunities.
[02:46:36.238 --> 02:46:37.898]  I've not gone out and started new operations.
[02:46:37.978 --> 02:46:40.639]  I've not, because that's like cheating on your wife.
[02:46:41.019 --> 02:46:44.020]  If she leaves you, then you get divorced and you get another wife or another woman.
[02:46:45.597 --> 02:46:54.022]  I'm fully committed to Infowars and I am like here doing nothing with all the opportunities and all the stuff, okay?
[02:46:54.062 --> 02:46:57.384]  They think it'll disrupt us, it's the opposite, it's going to blow up in their face, whatever.
[02:46:58.205 --> 02:47:05.349]  The last straw was, and I couldn't tell this a month ago in mediation in Fort Worth, two days with these people.
[02:47:06.470 --> 02:47:10.072]  Democrat top law firm, you know, the top law firm, Hillary's law firm, all of it.
[02:47:10.792 --> 02:47:13.654]  They were dumb enough last week.
[02:47:15.578 --> 02:47:18.761]  To have a mediation with my lawyers that was not a mediation.
[02:47:21.163 --> 02:47:22.624]  And my lawyers are very conservative.
[02:47:22.644 --> 02:47:24.706]  People say, well, my lawyers are dumb.
[02:47:25.006 --> 02:47:26.247]  I was in rigged court cases, folks.
[02:47:26.267 --> 02:47:27.007]  They were given a list.
[02:47:27.248 --> 02:47:31.771]  They're trying to take their law licenses because they did try to defend me.
[02:47:31.791 --> 02:47:33.873]  They were given huge lists of what they couldn't say.
[02:47:33.893 --> 02:47:36.175]  I was already found guilty of a rig.
[02:47:37.296 --> 02:47:38.557]  So I said, I'll do it next week.
[02:47:38.597 --> 02:47:39.418]  I'm already trying to do it.
[02:47:39.698 --> 02:47:41.760]  I told you about it for almost three hours last night.
[02:47:43.888 --> 02:47:50.718]  They are literally saying, well actually, we'll settle if Jones just doesn't talk about guns anymore.
[02:47:51.718 --> 02:47:53.059]  Now, we all know how that works, folks.
[02:47:53.079 --> 02:48:00.645]  I can keep the crew, I can stay here and do all this, but now I've already done a deal where I don't defend the Second Amendment.
[02:48:01.065 --> 02:48:05.949]  You can put a gun to my head and say, don't, you know, don't criticize transgenderism or I'll kill you.
[02:48:06.169 --> 02:48:07.210]  I can't physically do it.
[02:48:07.931 --> 02:48:09.492]  So it was more than just that.
[02:48:09.912 --> 02:48:12.134]  So we get back down to me being their political creature.
[02:48:13.115 --> 02:48:14.636]  And so I'm just like, hey, I trust God.
[02:48:14.656 --> 02:48:15.377]  Whatever happens, happens.
[02:48:15.417 --> 02:48:16.798]  And they cannot believe
[02:48:17.742 --> 02:48:18.423]  Thank you.
[02:48:36.983 --> 02:48:42.444]  So, that's where we are, but listeners and viewers need to understand, like, this is a very serious situation.
[02:48:42.744 --> 02:48:48.886]  And the minute they do the shutdown, and the judge may give us a week to shut down, three months, six months, I don't know.
[02:48:49.586 --> 02:48:50.466]  That's called a wind-down.
[02:48:51.347 --> 02:48:53.027]  But, we're here.
[02:48:53.307 --> 02:48:58.869]  So when I tell listeners, like, we're at the end of Infowars, it's emblematic of where the world and the country is right now.
[02:48:58.949 --> 02:49:03.550]  So, I'll continue to be honest, I'll continue to be forthright, honorable,
[02:49:05.540 --> 02:49:09.643]  The minute the judge says we're shutting it down, I will instantly go entertain all the deals.
[02:49:10.003 --> 02:49:11.825]  I will try to get the crew rehired.
[02:49:11.865 --> 02:49:15.608]  Obviously, I won't own it because they can try to get at me, but we're here.
[02:49:16.268 --> 02:49:21.272]  And so that shows you how long of a tooth America is, folks, that they don't want money.
[02:49:21.312 --> 02:49:27.357]  Like they said in Texas and in Connecticut in the courthouse, their lawyers said, don't send him money, don't buy his products.
[02:49:27.737 --> 02:49:28.618]  We want to shut him down.
[02:49:28.998 --> 02:49:30.719]  And I thought, maybe that's talk.
[02:49:31.580 --> 02:49:32.261]  No, it's not talk.
[02:49:33.662 --> 02:49:34.282]  It's not talk.
[02:49:34.322 --> 02:49:35.043]  They said literally,
[02:49:36.175 --> 02:49:38.077]  Come here and talk to us about your politics.
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:49:58.362]  Started over the Second Amendment.
[02:49:58.962 --> 02:50:06.550]  So to me, them, because I couldn't do it in mediation, which this went on mediation, obviously, now they've done it outside of that.
[02:50:07.011 --> 02:50:12.777]  And it was like giving me the metaphysical card I needed because I felt so bad about it before shutting down.
[02:50:13.357 --> 02:50:15.440]  And I just I love the best crew ever.
[02:50:15.460 --> 02:50:16.421]  I mean, they're hard to get.
[02:50:16.441 --> 02:50:18.503]  These are I love every one of these men and women in there.
[02:50:19.568 --> 02:50:26.114]  But when they did that, and my lawyer's like, no, you can talk about it, they openly said it, it took away any guilt I have.
[02:50:26.134 --> 02:50:29.377]  Because I was really struggling with that, you know, Dr. Curt, Elliot.
[02:50:31.018 --> 02:50:31.639]  So that's where we are.
[02:50:31.659 --> 02:50:32.599]  I mean, this is epic.
[02:50:33.060 --> 02:50:36.603]  And you know, they've come to Trump with the same thing, just, it's like the devil up with Christ.
[02:50:36.623 --> 02:50:39.526]  I'm gonna compare myself to Christ, but we're all like an archetype of that beneath Christ.
[02:50:39.966 --> 02:50:43.069]  Just, just, just, just deny God for a minute, I'll give you the whole world.
[02:50:43.449 --> 02:50:45.070]  They're literally like, it's like, are you?
[02:50:46.111 --> 02:50:48.913]  Thank you for putting me in this position to say no!
[02:50:49.233 --> 02:50:51.115]  This is like the most valuable thing of my life!
[02:50:51.135 --> 02:50:55.377]  I mean, it's like, I'm not like, halfway like, oh, maybe I should do it.
[02:50:55.417 --> 02:50:57.479]  I'm like, oh, how about hell no?
[02:50:57.999 --> 02:50:59.160]  How about fuck no?
[02:51:00.834 --> 02:51:02.735]  Well, that's their pride, Alex.
[02:51:02.815 --> 02:51:05.236]  Everything we've been talking about, pride, comes before the fall.
[02:51:05.276 --> 02:51:06.957]  But I got God watching me!
[02:51:07.197 --> 02:51:08.017]  I got an audience of one.
[02:51:08.258 --> 02:51:09.038]  I've told listeners this.
[02:51:09.658 --> 02:51:12.159]  Folks, I don't claim to be the most godly man or the most perfect guy.
[02:51:12.319 --> 02:51:12.900]  I just love God.
[02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:14.300]  I got an audience of one.
[02:51:14.420 --> 02:51:16.041]  Every time I'm on the air, I'm thinking, God's watching.
[02:51:16.121 --> 02:51:17.042]  My audience is God.
[02:51:17.262 --> 02:51:19.303]  When I'm speaking to people, I'm speaking to the Creator.
[02:51:19.583 --> 02:51:20.763]  I'm, like, trying to be good.
[02:51:21.044 --> 02:51:22.984]  I'm, like, literally, like, humble.
[02:51:23.245 --> 02:51:25.746]  Because I'm in the presence of the Maker, man.
[02:51:26.326 --> 02:51:27.046]  He's watching.
[02:51:27.507 --> 02:51:28.107]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[02:51:29.605 --> 02:51:30.246]  Is a good rant.
[02:51:30.646 --> 02:51:31.747]  And it was worth saying.
[02:51:31.767 --> 02:51:36.570]  I mean, this is a microcosm of what's happening in the world.
[02:51:37.371 --> 02:51:38.872]  They're trying to shut down truth.
[02:51:39.232 --> 02:51:41.074]  The world is trying to shut down truth.
[02:51:41.814 --> 02:51:42.475]  Even Alex
[02:51:43.687 --> 02:51:48.450]  Morgan Stanley, you know, big JPMorgan Chase, said the U.S.
[02:51:48.530 --> 02:51:54.753]  has only a couple of years left to fix its unsustainable debt problem or that's it.
[02:51:55.393 --> 02:51:55.773]  It's over.
[02:51:55.813 --> 02:51:56.774]  Now show that headline.
[02:51:56.814 --> 02:51:58.195]  That was like CNBC this week.
[02:51:58.355 --> 02:51:58.515]  Yeah.
[02:51:58.835 --> 02:51:59.835]  So what's it?
[02:52:00.396 --> 02:52:02.197]  What is it when they say it's over?
[02:52:02.217 --> 02:52:03.537]  All their derivatives.
[02:52:03.617 --> 02:52:04.538]  It's all coming to an end.
[02:52:04.758 --> 02:52:06.039]  Thank God we're not with them.
[02:52:06.239 --> 02:52:07.119]  Go and attack us.
[02:52:07.339 --> 02:52:08.020]  We ain't with you.
[02:52:09.322 --> 02:52:14.415]  Like, this is a chance to say, to jump ship, which you see all the globalists that push the poison shot.
[02:52:14.575 --> 02:52:15.358]  They're all jumping ship.
[02:52:17.721 --> 02:52:18.861]  Evil is not all-powerful.
[02:52:47.360 --> 02:52:48.822]  Oh, my favorite person.
[02:52:49.662 --> 02:52:50.003]  I know.
[02:52:50.343 --> 02:52:51.764]  He's all of our favorite person.
[02:52:52.084 --> 02:52:52.805]  I loved it.
[02:52:53.485 --> 02:52:59.991]  So, he said last week, we haven't seen this kind of debt since the Napoleonic Wars.
[02:53:00.751 --> 02:53:01.192]  It was in the 1800s.
[02:53:06.067 --> 02:53:13.355]  So, governments need to consider how to reduce their debt and take it in the right fiscal measures without getting into a situation where it kicks us off.
[02:53:14.236 --> 02:53:16.959]  I mean, they're starting to say, we've got this problem.
[02:53:17.019 --> 02:53:18.781]  What is the one thing that they're not doing?
[02:53:19.161 --> 02:53:20.943]  They're not taking the blame for it.
[02:53:21.604 --> 02:53:34.808]  They blame people like Trump and they blame everybody for just being spendaholics in America and it's all our fault and it's capitalism's fault and we've got a solution but they said this kind of debt we haven't seen since the Napoleonic Wars.
[02:53:35.429 --> 02:53:41.791]  It's their stinking central banks that have created the debt that go two trillion dollars into debt.
[02:53:42.771 --> 02:53:50.756]  Biden's budget for 2025 is over $2 trillion in the hole, and yet Congress says, it's a pretty good budget.
[02:53:51.096 --> 02:53:52.677]  It's like, what do you mean it's a pretty good budget?
[02:53:52.797 --> 02:53:55.939]  I mean, how in the world could you continue this?
[02:53:56.139 --> 02:53:58.021]  But here's the reason why they continue it.
[02:53:58.601 --> 02:54:11.252]  Because if you look, Alex, at what makes up our budget, 80%, just go to whitehouse.gov, look at the budget, 80% of everything that we bring in is entitlements.
[02:54:11.672 --> 02:54:16.717]  If you start to slash the budget, you're slashing the 80% of the entitlements.
[02:54:16.737 --> 02:54:18.438]  That's most of what we spend money on.
[02:54:18.778 --> 02:54:19.779]  And what does that slash?
[02:54:19.980 --> 02:54:20.960]  That slashes votes.
[02:54:21.821 --> 02:54:26.922]  So they can't get out of it without shooting themselves in the foot.
[02:54:26.942 --> 02:54:29.042]  We've got 12 minutes left in the live show.
[02:54:29.463 --> 02:54:30.943]  We're going to archive it, cut it up.
[02:54:31.023 --> 02:54:31.983]  It's an incredible interview.
[02:54:32.503 --> 02:54:35.164]  One for the history books, my ranch, your analysis.
[02:54:35.884 --> 02:54:38.024]  You've got the floor in the last 12, 13 minutes.
[02:54:38.524 --> 02:54:40.805]  Dr. Kirk Elliott, bottom line.
[02:54:42.885 --> 02:54:46.886]  Biden's economy gets an F. An absolute F.
[02:54:47.905 --> 02:54:53.708]  And what do we do to actually progress, to survive, to thrive?
[02:54:55.228 --> 02:54:56.689]  I'll put it into bullet point.
[02:54:56.929 --> 02:54:58.750]  Number one, don't have too much in paper.
[02:54:58.810 --> 02:55:00.591]  Don't have too much in the banking system.
[02:55:00.951 --> 02:55:06.334]  Look, if banks start to fail and you've got too much in the system, you are not going to get that back.
[02:55:06.574 --> 02:55:11.676]  FDIC only has 0.74% of all assets covered now, all deposits covered.
[02:55:11.716 --> 02:55:15.658]  They just stole this month three plus billion from accreditors.
[02:55:16.118 --> 02:55:18.039]  Yeah, another $3 billion they stole.
[02:55:18.419 --> 02:55:21.640]  So don't have too much in the banking system.
[02:55:22.521 --> 02:55:24.522]  This is just rule of thumb.
[02:55:24.742 --> 02:55:27.603]  When something's going down, get out of it as soon as you can.
[02:55:27.643 --> 02:55:30.104]  When something's going up, get into it as soon as you can.
[02:55:30.784 --> 02:55:35.106]  Everything that we see in normal traditional asset classes is a function of revenue.
[02:55:35.686 --> 02:55:37.287]  So, for example, the stock market.
[02:55:37.387 --> 02:55:38.408]  It's a function of revenue.
[02:55:38.748 --> 02:55:41.069]  And that means either people are spending money
[02:55:42.045 --> 02:55:42.905]  Which we're not.
[02:55:43.525 --> 02:55:44.506]  We're not spending money.
[02:55:44.546 --> 02:55:45.986]  Not when wages are coming down.
[02:55:46.746 --> 02:55:50.827]  I know Biden will tell us that, oh yeah, we're creating jobs.
[02:55:50.927 --> 02:55:54.928]  213,000 jobless claims, new ones, last week alone.
[02:55:55.388 --> 02:55:57.009]  That's the worst since August.
[02:55:57.349 --> 02:55:59.449]  So don't tell me that you're creating jobs.
[02:55:59.549 --> 02:55:59.889]  You're not.
[02:55:59.949 --> 02:56:01.730]  When people aren't working, they're not spending.
[02:56:02.190 --> 02:56:08.711]  So there's no revenue from us spending money to companies like, you know, whatever we spend money on.
[02:56:08.791 --> 02:56:10.372]  Walmart, Best Buy, Costco, wherever.
[02:56:11.212 --> 02:56:11.853]  It's not that.
[02:56:12.193 --> 02:56:13.674]  So where's the revenue coming from?
[02:56:13.834 --> 02:56:15.675]  It's coming from stimulus money.
[02:56:16.275 --> 02:56:18.176]  That's what's keeping markets propped up.
[02:56:18.597 --> 02:56:23.300]  That will come to an end without the petrodollar and the built-in demand for our currency.
[02:56:23.720 --> 02:56:25.941]  So here's where we look at that.
[02:56:26.021 --> 02:56:27.342]  Don't have too much money in the bank.
[02:56:27.942 --> 02:56:34.667]  I wouldn't have too much money allocated into a debt-based system, but rather allocate into strength.
[02:56:35.387 --> 02:56:40.149]  Allocating the strength, gold, silver going up really nicely.
[02:56:40.169 --> 02:56:41.569]  I mean, you look at it.
[02:56:41.829 --> 02:56:46.031]  Silver is twenty eight dollars and fifteen cents at the time of this airing.
[02:56:46.711 --> 02:56:50.652]  I mean, it was twenty two dollars 60 days ago.
[02:56:51.112 --> 02:56:52.633]  The growth is incredible.
[02:56:52.693 --> 02:56:57.595]  And it's because of these fundamental issues that are facing our global economy.
[02:56:58.155 --> 02:57:00.476]  We just need to allocate into that strength.
[02:57:00.516 --> 02:57:01.176]  And this is where.
[02:57:02.236 --> 02:57:06.820]  I will keep shouting it from the rooftops, Alex, until there's nobody else to listen.
[02:57:07.621 --> 02:57:10.623]  Because it's that important that people allocate into strength.
[02:57:10.803 --> 02:57:12.344]  Get out of things that are coming down.
[02:57:13.025 --> 02:57:13.825]  Get out of danger.
[02:57:13.985 --> 02:57:15.506]  Get out of the path of that hurricane.
[02:57:15.967 --> 02:57:16.988]  Now, how do you do it?
[02:57:17.668 --> 02:57:20.209]  You go into bullion and bullion only.
[02:57:20.649 --> 02:57:23.230]  That's five different things that you could go into.
[02:57:23.250 --> 02:57:29.733]  100 ounce bars of silver, 10 ounce bars of silver, 1 ounce silver rounds, 1 ounce gold bars, or kilo bars of gold.
[02:57:30.073 --> 02:57:30.433]  That's it.
[02:57:30.814 --> 02:57:35.796]  If it's not one of those things, I would not recommend it because the premiums are too high, the commissions can be too high.
[02:57:36.616 --> 02:57:38.257]  And you want something that's liquid.
[02:57:38.297 --> 02:57:39.759]  Liquidity is kink.
[02:57:40.259 --> 02:57:52.309]  When you go to sell it and lock in your profits, you better have something that's bullion, that's a global commodity that's used for manufacturing, and not rely on a firm to actually have to make a market to sell it.
[02:57:52.649 --> 02:58:00.976]  Because what if that firm goes out of business and they were the only one marketing some kind of a fancy rare coin or some kind of a collectible or commemorative or something like that?
[02:58:01.576 --> 02:58:02.917]  Boy, that makes no sense.
[02:58:03.377 --> 02:58:03.817]  No sense.
[02:58:04.397 --> 02:58:18.444]  I don't even like government issued things like Canadian Maple Leafs, Gold Eagles, Silver Eagles, because just like anything, Alex, once the government touches it, they ruin it and they make it too expensive.
[02:58:18.965 --> 02:58:23.727]  So I would just do generic refinery rounds or bullion bars.
[02:58:24.107 --> 02:58:25.188]  That's the cheapest way to go.
[02:58:25.968 --> 02:58:35.355]  This is how you start to really accumulate wealth, is maximize your ounces, minimize your cost, and just ride out the trend.
[02:58:35.695 --> 02:58:37.377]  And this is what we will help you do.
[02:58:37.877 --> 02:58:51.427]  If it's just a brokerage account, cash you have in the bank, an IRA rollover, you can roll over your IRA, get out of paper, get out of ETFs and those things that are, you know, a normal advisor say, well, I can put you into silver and the silver ETF.
[02:58:51.447 --> 02:58:52.388]  It's like, that's paper.
[02:58:52.748 --> 02:58:53.689]  That's not the same.
[02:58:54.389 --> 02:58:54.569]  Right.
[02:58:54.669 --> 02:58:59.713]  It's you need to allocate into tangible assets.
[02:59:00.373 --> 02:59:03.135]  That's if you want silver, then allocate into silver.
[02:59:03.456 --> 02:59:05.377]  If you want gold, allocate into gold.
[02:59:05.517 --> 02:59:10.240]  Those are things that are that are going to defy.
[02:59:11.186 --> 02:59:16.288]  Paper manipulation, because there's inventory constraints, there's supply and demand.
[02:59:16.348 --> 02:59:20.670]  The law of economics, you know, supply and demand comes into play here.
[02:59:21.270 --> 02:59:34.156]  When you've got COMEX depositories running out of silver, we get to take advantage of that supply chain disruption of that low supply, allocate into strength, grow, have a smile on your face.
[02:59:34.556 --> 02:59:34.896]  So again,
[02:59:35.296 --> 02:59:46.139]  Whether it's just cash in your accounts, brokerage accounts, or an IRA rollover, the key is silver bullion, gold bullion, low cost, maximize your ounces.
[02:59:46.559 --> 02:59:49.520]  That's what my team will help you allocate into that strength.
[02:59:49.920 --> 02:59:55.942]  And Alex, I am not going to stop shouting this from the rooftops until there's nobody else to listen because it's that important.
[02:59:56.062 --> 03:00:02.183]  I think the economy as we know it is changing before our eyes and in the blink of an eye.
[03:00:02.464 --> 03:00:03.824]  We're going to wake up someday and say,
[03:00:05.728 --> 03:00:07.350]  We've got central bank digital currency.
[03:00:07.670 --> 03:00:09.132]  There's no more privacy anymore.
[03:00:09.232 --> 03:00:11.114]  I wish I would have done something.
[03:00:22.043 --> 03:00:23.364]  Ice water in the Sahara Desert.
[03:00:23.445 --> 03:00:27.409]  I mean, I only promote what is absolutely clear and that supports our message.
[03:00:27.669 --> 03:00:28.329]  That's all I do.
[03:00:28.570 --> 03:00:29.551]  This is a no-brainer.
[03:00:30.892 --> 03:00:37.098]  I mean, the fundamental supply and demand forces, geopolitical, political consequences that we're seeing every single day.
[03:00:37.879 --> 03:00:41.083]  If you go back to 2020 during COVID, silver was $11.91 an ounce about 17 months ago.
[03:00:41.123 --> 03:00:41.904]  It was $17.97 an ounce today.
[03:00:41.924 --> 03:00:42.865]  Well, just 70 days ago, it was $22.
[03:00:42.905 --> 03:00:43.886]  Now it's just $28.5.
[03:00:53.177 --> 03:00:59.201]  I mean, Alex, that is incredible growth and that will put a smile on anybody's face that's allocated.
[03:00:59.221 --> 03:01:02.443]  Well, I'm so pissed because I got so focused on bankruptcy, trying to keep free speech going.
[03:01:02.463 --> 03:01:03.523]  I have no money, which is fine.
[03:01:03.563 --> 03:01:04.464]  It's not how I judge myself.
[03:01:04.984 --> 03:01:05.925]  You know, I'm being persecuted.
[03:01:05.965 --> 03:01:06.345]  It's fine.
[03:01:06.986 --> 03:01:11.909]  I just, as I recall, my family last six months saying, call Dr. Kirk Kelly and get sober now.
[03:01:12.329 --> 03:01:15.071]  Because it's like, it's like, it's a no-brainer.
[03:01:15.151 --> 03:01:16.792]  I mean, this is like literally
[03:01:17.893 --> 03:01:20.215]  Selling a scuba diver oxygen at 100 feet under the water.
[03:01:20.615 --> 03:01:22.397]  His tank's out, here's your new tank!
[03:01:22.877 --> 03:01:23.037]  Yeah.
[03:01:23.157 --> 03:01:23.958]  I mean, it's not...
[03:01:24.755 --> 03:01:27.217]  And it's for such a time as this, right?
[03:01:27.937 --> 03:01:30.179]  I'm not saying gold and silver are the greatest things since sliced bread.
[03:01:30.219 --> 03:01:32.221]  It's probably not going to be the last investment you ever have.
[03:01:32.281 --> 03:01:36.544]  Unless we have central banks that are backed by gold, which I think we will, then you might never want to get out of gold.
[03:01:37.064 --> 03:01:38.806]  But really, time and place for everything.
[03:01:38.866 --> 03:01:39.966]  It's the smartest investment.
[03:01:40.087 --> 03:01:42.669]  It is the smartest investment for right now to protect.
[03:01:42.689 --> 03:01:43.369]  The no-brainer.
[03:01:43.389 --> 03:01:43.849]  Preserve.
[03:01:43.909 --> 03:01:46.451]  I mean, something, this is so obvious.
[03:01:46.511 --> 03:01:48.073]  It's like you saw Tiger Woods in his prime.
[03:01:48.333 --> 03:01:49.233]  That's the best golfer.
[03:01:50.314 --> 03:01:52.295]  Mike Tyson, that's the best boxer.
[03:01:53.356 --> 03:01:55.737]  Michael Jordan, they're all black, that's just men's teams as they are.
[03:01:56.657 --> 03:01:58.058]  That's the best basketball player.
[03:01:58.098 --> 03:01:59.619]  I mean, it's THE thing.
[03:01:59.699 --> 03:02:03.681]  It's like, there's no... He's so high above everything else, there's no debating.
[03:02:04.741 --> 03:02:06.142]  I mean, you look at Michael Jordan.
[03:02:06.422 --> 03:02:08.703]  Possibly the best basketball player of all time.
[03:02:08.903 --> 03:02:10.624]  Nobody can touch him.
[03:02:11.516 --> 03:02:11.716]  Right.
[03:02:12.336 --> 03:02:14.458]  Nobody could ever touch that kind of success.
[03:02:14.998 --> 03:02:15.818]  How did he do it?
[03:02:16.079 --> 03:02:17.700]  He was in the right place at the right time.
[03:02:17.780 --> 03:02:18.340]  He practiced.
[03:02:18.360 --> 03:02:18.980]  He did hard.
[03:02:19.040 --> 03:02:20.561]  He went against the trend.
[03:02:20.941 --> 03:02:22.622]  And he had the genetics.
[03:02:23.243 --> 03:02:27.145]  Yeah, and the rest of the team hated him because he was always working.
[03:02:27.585 --> 03:02:28.726]  This is what we do.
[03:02:28.766 --> 03:02:34.029]  We're always working, looking at politics, and not many firms will do this, but we'll take
[03:02:34.409 --> 03:02:42.834]  Politics, economics, the social landscape, the spiritual landscape, put all of those puzzle pieces together, and that gives us a pretty clear picture, Alex.
[03:02:43.154 --> 03:02:46.896]  Silver is Michael Jordan right now, and gold is LeBron James.
[03:02:50.319 --> 03:02:50.459]  Yeah.
[03:02:51.200 --> 03:02:52.101]  Michael Jordan was the best.
[03:02:52.581 --> 03:02:53.862]  So why would you not bet on that?
[03:02:54.283 --> 03:02:54.463]  Yeah.
[03:02:55.023 --> 03:02:57.325]  So you want to put a smile on your face.
[03:02:57.365 --> 03:03:01.509]  You want to start to melt away the financial anxiety that the people... Well, it's so frustrating.
[03:03:01.549 --> 03:03:02.550]  The answer is right there.
[03:03:02.570 --> 03:03:04.792]  It's not the answer to your family or your relationship with God.
[03:03:04.832 --> 03:03:05.653]  That's more important.
[03:03:05.673 --> 03:03:07.695]  But when it comes to finances, it's a no-brainer.
[03:03:08.387 --> 03:03:09.968]  Yeah, absolutely a no-brainer.
[03:03:10.068 --> 03:03:25.498]  And here's where it is my mission to try to put a smile on people's face by melting away the financial anxiety that Biden, that Jerome Powell, that Janet Yellen, that Putin, that China brings into our lives that internal strife and fear that everything is going to fall apart.
[03:03:25.518 --> 03:03:26.239]  You know what, Alex?
[03:03:26.259 --> 03:03:32.142]  I think everything is going to fall apart, but this will actually transcend time and be the right place at the right time.
[03:03:32.182 --> 03:03:35.945]  Bottom line, we're both salesmen, and a salesman wants to sell a good product.
[03:03:36.943 --> 03:03:40.305]  I don't go out and sell Chinese junk that breaks in one hour.
[03:03:40.405 --> 03:03:46.568]  I don't go out, I sell family, and God, and country, and freedom, and the Second Amendment, and gold and silver.
[03:03:46.628 --> 03:03:47.428]  It's an easy job.
[03:03:47.909 --> 03:03:49.089]  I promote what I do.
[03:03:49.329 --> 03:03:49.870]  It's easy.
[03:03:50.210 --> 03:03:56.113]  I can sell stuff because I'm selling oxygen to a diver whose tank ran out at 200 feet under the water.
[03:03:56.533 --> 03:03:57.834]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:03:58.294 --> 03:03:59.755]  I mean, it's not rocket science, folks.
[03:03:59.795 --> 03:04:01.396]  It's so easy to go what's real.
[03:04:02.344 --> 03:04:12.227]  Men, and women, and families, and God, and the planet, and what we're doing, and you helping keep us on air, and then the great stuff you're doing, regardless what happens to Infowars, I know we're going to work together.
[03:04:13.688 --> 03:04:16.409]  So this guy's key in the future to the whole operation, folks.
[03:04:16.929 --> 03:04:17.649]  You need to call.
[03:04:18.590 --> 03:04:22.731]  I personally say take physical delivery, but don't tell anybody you got it, folks.
[03:04:24.132 --> 03:04:26.472]  They got depositories all over the country.
[03:04:27.353 --> 03:04:28.193]  Those are great as well.
[03:04:28.959 --> 03:04:30.820]  What do you recommend when people call and get the silver and gold?
[03:04:30.840 --> 03:04:32.121]  If you're going to do that, what do they do?
[03:04:48.272 --> 03:04:48.632]  For you.
[03:04:49.092 --> 03:04:50.053]  Transition easy.
[03:04:50.273 --> 03:04:51.033]  The burden light.
[03:04:51.593 --> 03:04:53.114]  And look, everybody's different.
[03:04:53.374 --> 03:04:56.755]  You take physical delivery of it home or you store it at a depository.
[03:04:56.795 --> 03:04:58.396]  Not all depositories are created equal.
[03:04:58.496 --> 03:04:59.536]  I would only choose one of them.
[03:05:00.017 --> 03:05:03.058]  I choose the Texas Precious Metals Depository in Shiner, Texas.
[03:05:03.618 --> 03:05:05.679]  Because of the ownership status.
[03:05:05.739 --> 03:05:06.679]  It's singular ownership.
[03:05:06.699 --> 03:05:07.939]  They have segregated storage.
[03:05:07.959 --> 03:05:09.240]  They have unlimited insurance.
[03:05:09.620 --> 03:05:13.381]  I've known the owners for decades and they're God-fearing patriots like we are.
[03:05:13.761 --> 03:05:16.802]  And in Texas, Alex, it's a different kind of a state.
[03:05:16.862 --> 03:05:18.663]  They're very favorable legislation.
[03:05:18.683 --> 03:05:20.203]  Designed to fight carpetbaggers.
[03:05:20.503 --> 03:05:21.804]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:05:21.824 --> 03:05:22.624]  What about split?
[03:05:23.024 --> 03:05:23.925]  Have some at home.
[03:05:24.185 --> 03:05:24.885]  Some of the depository.
[03:05:25.236 --> 03:05:36.421]  Yeah, I think that's great, because you probably want to have a little bit at home to cover you in a barter situation if there's a complete meltdown and you can't... nobody... merchants don't even want to... But don't let anybody know, because the danger is getting stuck up.
[03:05:36.681 --> 03:05:38.242]  Yeah, and I wouldn't have too much at home.
[03:05:38.322 --> 03:05:38.982]  I would store it.
[03:05:39.122 --> 03:05:40.663]  I store mine at the depository.
[03:05:40.723 --> 03:05:41.803]  It's simply just safer.
[03:05:42.203 --> 03:05:46.745]  And when you want to lock in the ratio trade that we're talking about, it's fast.
[03:05:46.906 --> 03:05:47.166]  It's easy.
[03:05:47.186 --> 03:05:49.187]  You guys sell it for nothing, which nobody else does.
[03:05:50.007 --> 03:05:52.288]  When you liquidate, we don't charge a commission, correct?
[03:05:53.824 --> 03:05:55.105]  I don't know any other firm that does.
[03:05:55.665 --> 03:05:56.686]  Incredible.

[03:06:11.793 --> 03:06:13.974]  Incredible hour and 45 minutes.
[03:06:14.294 --> 03:06:14.654]  Thank you.
[03:06:15.114 --> 03:06:15.875]  It was great being here.
[03:06:16.055 --> 03:06:17.775]  And the Judy Megavitz thing was powerful.
[03:06:17.895 --> 03:06:18.595]  That was powerful.
[03:06:19.016 --> 03:06:19.916]  She was feisty today.
[03:06:20.276 --> 03:06:20.856]  She was on a mission.
[03:06:20.876 --> 03:06:21.256]  Well, she's pissed.
[03:06:21.276 --> 03:06:21.496]  I get it.
[03:06:21.516 --> 03:06:22.076]  She's right.
[03:06:22.217 --> 03:06:22.717]  Yeah.
[03:06:22.737 --> 03:06:25.017]  I mean, what she's saying is all true, and you get why she's pissed.
[03:06:25.077 --> 03:06:25.818]  Yeah, I do too.
[03:06:25.878 --> 03:06:26.558]  At least she's awake.
[03:06:26.798 --> 03:06:27.898]  She's alive, you know.
[03:06:27.998 --> 03:06:28.398]  Exactly.
[03:06:28.418 --> 03:06:29.119]  Starting to fight with her.
[03:06:30.379 --> 03:06:31.180]  She's ready to go to war.
[03:06:31.340 --> 03:06:32.060]  Yeah, she is.
[03:06:32.321 --> 03:06:33.101]  She's a great lady.
[03:06:33.682 --> 03:06:41.848]  Well, you should come back in the next few weeks when you're ready to talk about it all, but the move to shut down Gold & Silver is coming very soon.
[03:06:42.649 --> 03:06:45.792]  And it's not me, just, everything I say is, I know, okay?
[03:06:45.872 --> 03:06:47.133]  I don't just say something to get you to do it.
[03:06:47.593 --> 03:06:49.455]  They're coming after the distributors.
[03:06:50.095 --> 03:06:51.776]  Most of them are overcharging you.
[03:06:51.816 --> 03:06:52.497]  This guy's not.
[03:06:52.717 --> 03:06:54.098]  There's some other great people out there as well.
[03:06:55.079 --> 03:06:56.560]  They're coming after it, folks.
[03:06:56.620 --> 03:06:59.723]  So, not after your holding of it, your ability to get it.
[03:07:00.879 --> 03:07:01.039]  Yeah.
[03:07:02.180 --> 03:07:02.961]  Take action now.

[03:07:06.784 --> 03:07:08.966]  Mayor Kirk Elliott, incredible job.
[03:07:09.006 --> 03:07:09.707]  Thank you so much, brother.
[03:07:10.127 --> 03:07:11.168]  It's so great being here.
[03:07:11.208 --> 03:07:11.549]  Thank you.
[03:07:11.569 --> 03:07:12.650]  30-second closing comment.
[03:07:13.792 --> 03:07:16.494]  Don't let fear cause you to not act.
[03:07:17.275 --> 03:07:23.199]  It's a leap of faith, calling somebody that you've never talked to, different state, phone call, but you know what?
[03:07:23.479 --> 03:07:28.903]  We've got clients all over the world, literally tens of thousands of clients all over the world.
[03:07:29.403 --> 03:07:33.106]  Give us a call, take that leap of faith, and then you act after that.
[03:07:33.126 --> 03:07:37.669]  I'll say this, my gut, which is the Holy Spirit, tells, plus you have top ratings, boom, go!
[03:07:38.730 --> 03:07:39.890]  It's like boom, boom, boom, boom, go!
[03:07:40.150 --> 03:07:44.452]  Yeah, we're eager to talk to you and help you give, get you that financial peace you're looking for.
[03:07:44.492 --> 03:07:47.292]  All right, we're going to rerun all this till tomorrow night at 4 p.m.
[03:07:47.312 --> 03:07:48.213]  when I go live again.
[03:07:48.233 --> 03:07:49.113]  It works all on air.
[03:07:49.453 --> 03:07:51.273]  And folks, Imperial troops have entered the base.
[03:07:51.653 --> 03:07:53.454]  We are so close, but we're celebrating.
[03:07:53.954 --> 03:07:54.734]  We're not going to give up.
[03:07:55.014 --> 03:07:56.475]  Regardless, God will make it right.
[03:07:56.835 --> 03:07:58.015]  They killed Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[03:07:58.035 --> 03:07:58.895]  He just comes back stronger.
[03:07:59.215 --> 03:08:00.056]  Thank you so much, crew.
[03:08:00.096 --> 03:08:00.516]  Great job.
[03:08:00.536 --> 03:08:00.956]  Love you all.
[03:08:00.976 --> 03:08:01.236]  Thank you.
[03:08:14.296 --> 03:08:15.116]  I think the U.S.
[03:08:15.176 --> 03:08:21.561]  economy is about to hit the skids, and Russia and the BRICS nations are playing a masterful game of chess.
[03:08:22.042 --> 03:08:24.263]  And our administration's going in with like a checkerboard.
[03:08:24.283 --> 03:08:24.984]  They're not even playing.
[03:08:25.024 --> 03:08:27.145]  And the Federal Reserve has signaled they're down with interest rates.
[03:08:27.626 --> 03:08:34.251]  And things are going to get so bad, the globalists are going to usher in a new world of central bank digital currency.
[03:08:34.651 --> 03:08:36.251]  A form of money you cannot see.
[03:08:36.732 --> 03:08:38.632]  Central Bank Digital Currencies.
[03:08:38.912 --> 03:08:40.573]  They don't hide in the shadows anymore.
[03:08:40.593 --> 03:08:42.913]  They tell us exactly what they're going to do.
[03:08:43.313 --> 03:08:43.713]  Exactly.
[03:08:43.733 --> 03:08:44.554]  That's what's so frustrating.
[03:08:44.814 --> 03:08:49.015]  If you study it, you know the battle plan, but they know the public doesn't check that out.
[03:08:49.795 --> 03:08:51.115]  But we're able to give it to the public.
[03:08:51.155 --> 03:08:52.576]  That could really mess up their operation.
[03:08:52.896 --> 03:08:57.937]  The world is going to see a functioning CBDC very soon, within the coming year.
[03:08:58.337 --> 03:09:00.560]  We saw bank failure 1.0.
[03:09:01.221 --> 03:09:05.788]  It was Silicon Valley, Credit Suisse, First Republic, Silvergate Bank.
[03:09:06.008 --> 03:09:06.830]  I mean, all of those.
[03:09:07.070 --> 03:09:14.561]  First, we had the effects of a dramatic rise in interest rates, leading to the closure of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank.
[03:09:14.961 --> 03:09:16.662]  That was just a tremor before the main thing.
[03:09:16.702 --> 03:09:19.663]  Yes, I think bank failures 2.0 is coming.
[03:09:19.703 --> 03:09:25.485]  I mean just last week the CEO of Citigroup said we're laying off 10% of our workforce.
[03:09:25.945 --> 03:09:29.947]  So at times of crisis which happens to be happening during an election year,
[03:09:31.187 --> 03:09:33.848]  People will say, okay, this is so bad.
[03:09:33.908 --> 03:09:34.768]  Banks are shutting down.
[03:09:34.848 --> 03:09:36.409]  All this economic failure.
[03:09:36.689 --> 03:09:37.729]  We'll give you what you want.
[03:09:37.789 --> 03:09:39.670]  Government just will give you away our freedoms.
[03:09:39.990 --> 03:09:41.050]  Just take care of us.
[03:09:41.150 --> 03:09:42.731]  Make sure that we can still feed our family.
[03:09:42.831 --> 03:09:44.491]  But this is happening in surprising numbers.
[03:09:44.691 --> 03:09:47.572]  We all sort of take our local bank for granted until it's gone.
[03:09:47.712 --> 03:09:50.533]  That's happening in 4,000 other locations around the country.
[03:09:50.773 --> 03:09:57.195]  And I think in the months ahead, we'll get more failures of regional banks around office space and commercial real estate.
[03:09:57.685 --> 03:10:03.690]  Surveillance and privacy issues could arise if the central bank is able to monitor every transaction.
[03:10:03.810 --> 03:10:11.496]  We've had, over the last three weeks, major disturbances in the banking world, right?
[03:10:11.656 --> 03:10:16.760]  This comes after the regional bank suffered a week-long plunge in its stock, plus a credit downgrade.
[03:10:16.960 --> 03:10:29.662]  We've seen stocks of things like Comerica Bank, PacWest Bank, New York Community Bank, and even Schwab just start to hit the scales.
[03:10:29.702 --> 03:10:32.763]  By the way, when you first came on months ago, you predicted this.
[03:10:33.923 --> 03:10:36.764]  Yeah, I mean, because the writing was on the wall.
[03:10:36.804 --> 03:10:44.145]  There's another big concern that a central bank issued digital currency could cause a bank run during economic instability.
[03:10:44.602 --> 03:10:45.602]  Here's the ugly reality.
[03:10:45.642 --> 03:10:50.784]  We are no different than Argentina, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Greece, Cyprus.
[03:10:51.244 --> 03:10:59.427]  Any country who loses demand for their currency and is forced to print, they go into an inflationary spiral that brings social chaos.
[03:10:59.887 --> 03:11:09.289]  Tangible assets like gold and silver are so important, not just because they're growing, because I think it's a means to protect your financial privacy and financial freedom.
[03:11:09.649 --> 03:11:22.352]  I think there's going to be alternative systems of using tangible assets like gold and silver to back private currencies for individuals to actually be able to transact business on their own, not be a digital slave in their digital world.
[03:11:22.772 --> 03:11:26.993]  These are the kind of solutions that I've been shouting from the rooftops for decades, Alex.
[03:11:27.253 --> 03:11:28.594]  Inflation is coming.
[03:11:28.955 --> 03:11:32.618]  What happens to tangible assets like gold and silver during inflation?
[03:11:32.958 --> 03:11:33.519]  They go up!
[03:11:33.699 --> 03:11:35.901]  People do need to get basic gold and silver.
[03:11:36.241 --> 03:11:38.964]  They need to at least stick their toe in the ocean and do it.
[03:11:39.004 --> 03:11:41.586]  They need to go to your website, KEPM.
[03:11:41.686 --> 03:11:43.728]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[03:11:44.148 --> 03:11:46.209]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[03:11:46.229 --> 03:11:51.670]  That's KEPM.com forward slash gold.

[03:11:53.030 --> 03:11:57.152]  They need to talk to you folks and start getting gold and silver bullion now.
[03:11:57.472 --> 03:12:00.712]  But regardless, we're in for an insane time.
