[00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:22.207]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:23.590]  I'm your host Sha'Carri Jackson.
[00:00:24.092 --> 00:00:27.500]  It is March 30th, 2016 and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.277 --> 00:00:42.101]  Tonight, one of the first federal agencies to arm itself against the American public, the BLM, may be demilitarized if a bill introduced by the Utah congressional delegation passes.
[00:00:42.802 --> 00:00:55.627]  And, while the BLM terrorizes Americans, slain Border Patrol agent Brian Terry's brother reveals the ATF armed not only Mexican drug cartels, but Middle East terrorists with the Fast and Furious program.
[00:00:56.107 --> 00:01:04.014]  Tosh Plumlee and I, both from congressional offices, were admonished to stop talking to the Terry family.
[00:01:04.194 --> 00:01:08.397]  Then, we take a look at the moronic army of Trump protesters.
[00:01:08.678 --> 00:01:15.864]  I was talking to a Trump supporter and he was talking about wanting his rights and his rights.
[00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:19.487]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.124]  Operation Fast and Furious is something that we've talked about a great deal on the show.
[00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:14.891]  If you watched the show yesterday, you saw the interview that Alex Jones conducted with some family and friends of the slain Border Patrol agent Brian Terry.
[00:03:15.291 --> 00:03:26.020]  Now, when they talk about Fast and Furious, they'd like you to believe that this was pretty much a bot stray that neither Attorney General at the time, Eric Holder, nor Lanny Breuer, his deputy, knew anything about.
[00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:34.964]  Meanwhile, you find out that Brewer had sent frequent emails to Holder at the time, and both of them were just able to walk away into the sunset.
[00:03:35.484 --> 00:03:39.586]  Brewer left pretty much immediately after the hearings, and Holder left a year or two later.
[00:03:40.106 --> 00:03:49.449]  But the situation is that nobody really got in trouble for it, even though it was a massive operation that cost American taxpayer money and also American lives.
[00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.370]  And that's the case that we see when we had
[00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:59.072]  Lieutenant Colonel Matt Smith-Meck on the show, and he's speaking on behalf of Brian Terry's family about the operation in Mexico.
[00:03:59.512 --> 00:04:13.596]  And he says it's not only guns and rifles, but also grenades, grenade launchers, military-grade night vision goggles, black special forces tactical uniforms, adding that the number of military items relinquished is more in the magnitude of 4,700.
[00:04:15.717 --> 00:04:23.079]  Because they keep saying that, yeah, we let a few rifles go, and then it came out on CBS News, like, yeah, okay, maybe a sniper rifle made it out there.
[00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.780]  No, this was a lot of ordinance.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.101]  We're not talking about, you know, little bolt action 22s and BB guns.
[00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:31.361]  No, this is stuff that does serious damage.
[00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:32.762]  Meanwhile, you see that the...
[00:04:33.962 --> 00:04:38.267]  The gun stores that they're on the border and around the Phoenix area saying, Hey, we don't really know about this.
[00:04:38.287 --> 00:04:42.152]  We'd really like to help you guys out in the ATF, but what you're doing here can't be illegal.
[00:04:42.172 --> 00:04:43.995]  They say, Hey, let us worry about this.
[00:04:44.055 --> 00:04:45.857]  We're going to ship all these guns down to Mexico.
[00:04:46.197 --> 00:04:50.142]  And then when we catch the cartels with the firearms, then we're going to arrest them.
[00:04:50.202 --> 00:04:51.524]  And they're like, well, how does that make sense?
[00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:59.566]  How many innocent people are going to die between the time that you ship these things and the times they show up at some crime scenes like they found with El Chapo.
[00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:01.227]  El Chapo had that .50 caliber rifle.
[00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:03.748]  And a lot more than that went to many other people.
[00:05:03.788 --> 00:05:05.068]  But nobody wants to talk about this.
[00:05:05.348 --> 00:05:06.689]  They want to sweep it under the rug.
[00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:08.309]  And then you see the emails that come out.
[00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:13.131]  CBS News saying that multiple people in the Justice Department were sending emails back and forth.
[00:05:13.431 --> 00:05:15.771]  Hey, we can use this to demonize the American gun owner.
[00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:17.872]  And then President Obama has the audacity
[00:05:18.172 --> 00:05:24.556]  To go down to Mexico and blame the gun violence in Mexico, not on the cartels, not on the ATF shipping guns down.
[00:05:24.856 --> 00:05:26.457]  No, it's the American gun owner.
[00:05:26.517 --> 00:05:35.241]  If we didn't have all these, you know, guys up in, you know, Vermont or Indiana or wherever the hell people go hunting, saying that, hey, I want to go out in the backwoods and, you know, shoot a buck.
[00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:39.484]  If it wasn't for all that, you guys wouldn't have all this gun violence in Mexico.
[00:05:39.504 --> 00:05:45.547]  If you didn't have these guys out in Texas hog hunting, you wouldn't have this gun violence in Mexico, completely ignoring the fact that,
[00:05:46.207 --> 00:05:54.631]  Many areas of Mexico, including Sinaloa, where El Chapo was, have been plagued by gun violence, by cartel violence for a very long time.
[00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:58.773]  It has nothing to do with new gun regulations, or lack thereof.
[00:05:59.113 --> 00:06:06.596]  It has everything to do with the criminal state that's going on down there, and banning guns here in the states is going to do nothing to cease that.
[00:06:07.076 --> 00:06:10.678]  But hopefully people will come to recognize this and see it as it truly is.
[00:06:11.118 --> 00:06:16.807]  It was a horrible idea that really nobody has taken account for, except for the people who unfortunately died.
[00:06:16.867 --> 00:06:18.229]  People like Brian Terry.
[00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:23.096]  So we definitely do thank Lieutenant Colonel Matt Smith-Mack for coming on and exposing this in detail.
[00:06:23.976 --> 00:06:25.557]  Now from the ATF to the BLM.
[00:06:25.917 --> 00:06:28.338]  You guys know we've talked about the BLM a good deal here.
[00:06:28.658 --> 00:06:46.266]  In regards to what you think about the Bundys or you know other people involved in these type of situations in conflict with the BLM, you cannot deny that the BLM has not had a exact perfect handling of these issues because you guys recall with the Bundy situation you have the BLM who's supposed to be the champion for wildlife.
[00:06:46.286 --> 00:06:48.426]  They're supposed to go out there and keep the wildlife safe, right?
[00:06:48.807 --> 00:06:49.247]  Okay, so
[00:06:49.767 --> 00:06:50.347]  Think about this.
[00:06:50.387 --> 00:06:51.228]  This actually happened.
[00:06:51.868 --> 00:06:54.249]  Mr. Bundy has his cattle grazing out there.
[00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:55.729]  So what does the BLM do?
[00:06:55.869 --> 00:07:00.671]  They say we have to protect the tortoises, so we're going to shoot all the cattle in the head and throw them into a ditch.
[00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:02.192]  We've shown you those photos.
[00:07:02.552 --> 00:07:07.594]  Meanwhile, the tortoises were eating the cow poop in the otherwise barren desert, and that was keeping them alive.
[00:07:07.614 --> 00:07:10.795]  But once again, they say that they're there protecting the animal rights.
[00:07:11.235 --> 00:07:13.496]  And we see a Republican in the House of Representatives
[00:07:13.976 --> 00:07:19.819]  Has reduced a bill calling for the termination of the Forest Service and the BLM law enforcement functions.
[00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:28.683]  The legislation, set to become law on September 30, 2017 if passed by Congress, will close down the BLM Office of Law Enforcement.
[00:07:29.443 --> 00:07:44.870]  And as I say about any government agency, I'm sure there are plenty of good people in the BLM, in the Forest Agency, in the ATF, who are reeling from the black eyes of this publicity, but at the same time, when you've got so much blatant corruption and just mismanagement, you have to do something about it.
[00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:54.035]  Maybe shutting it down in general isn't always the best answer, but you definitely, in my opinion, need to cut it back, as you should do with many federal agencies, because that's always the deal.
[00:07:54.335 --> 00:07:57.196]  We have a federal government that's so big, it's unwieldy.
[00:07:57.616 --> 00:07:59.176]  I don't know what all these moving parts are doing.
[00:07:59.196 --> 00:08:06.158]  Why don't you strip it down to a manageable household, a household of items, so you know what's going on.
[00:08:06.218 --> 00:08:08.218]  Because that's always the excuse, I didn't know what's going on.
[00:08:08.998 --> 00:08:10.099]  Is anybody going to go to jail?
[00:08:10.119 --> 00:08:11.339]  Is anybody going to be held accountable?
[00:08:11.619 --> 00:08:16.200]  It reminds me, I wasn't alive at the time, but I could read the history books, and you think about things
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.681]  Like Nixon, right?
[00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:19.282]  Nixon's lying about stuff.
[00:08:19.302 --> 00:08:21.303]  They go to the White House, they shake the bars.
[00:08:21.343 --> 00:08:22.384]  People are so upset.
[00:08:22.684 --> 00:08:28.748]  And now you get these scandals that run out pretty much daily, if not weekly at least, and nobody really cares.
[00:08:28.788 --> 00:08:29.809]  They're so passive about it.
[00:08:29.849 --> 00:08:38.695]  It's just come to the point where you can't even point out the wrongdoing of the administration or your, you know, whatever-ist they want to attack you with on this week.
[00:08:38.715 --> 00:08:44.378]  Let's talk about some international news when we talk about the migrants going all over the world, not just here in the U.S.
[00:08:44.418 --> 00:08:46.200]  I know it's a big deal here as well.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:54.927]  And as I always say about the migrants, you know, if you're a church, if you're a private organization, private individual, and you say, hey, these people are welcome in my home.
[00:08:55.688 --> 00:08:58.810]  I'll help them, you know, become naturalized, do whatever I can to help them.
[00:08:59.071 --> 00:08:59.531]  That's fine.
[00:08:59.571 --> 00:08:59.971]  That's good.
[00:09:00.012 --> 00:09:00.452]  That's great.
[00:09:00.512 --> 00:09:01.353]  That's humanitarian.
[00:09:01.393 --> 00:09:02.894]  Good for you, humanitarian.
[00:09:02.914 --> 00:09:11.822]  But the issue is we see so many people championing opening up the borders to, you know, mass number of migrants, you know, without background checks or anything to the sort.
[00:09:12.122 --> 00:09:13.423]  And then nobody wants to take care of them.
[00:09:13.463 --> 00:09:16.685]  You see these celebrities saying that, hey, we need to let these migrants in.
[00:09:16.825 --> 00:09:22.510]  Meanwhile, they got four or five different houses and they don't want to let a migrant stay in any one of them with the exception of guys like Michael Moore.
[00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.411]  I'm not a big fan of Michael Moore, but I'll at least give him that.
[00:09:24.671 --> 00:09:26.913]  He put his money where his mouth is on that matter.
[00:09:27.253 --> 00:09:31.316]  But now we see that the people who come over the border, you know, I'm sure many of them good.
[00:09:31.716 --> 00:09:32.296]  We're good to go.
[00:09:47.327 --> 00:10:01.780]  Underneath the train tracks by a Paris subway on Wednesday, the migrants, mostly from Sudan and Afghanistan, will now be housed in emergency shelters for a month, allowing them to begin the asylum process the Interior Ministry has stated.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:12.249]  And they say this is the 19th evacuation of its kind in Paris since June of last year, which has seen 6,500 migrants move to emergency shelters.
[00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:12.729]  And once again,
[00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.954]  You take it upon yourself to house people, to clothe people, to feed them, you know, take the kids to school.
[00:10:18.014 --> 00:10:18.415]  That's great.
[00:10:18.455 --> 00:10:19.235]  That's humanitarian.
[00:10:19.636 --> 00:10:22.218]  But you can't ask everybody else to foot that bill.
[00:10:22.478 --> 00:10:26.382]  Because as I always say, you know, last year, David Knight and myself went to the White House.
[00:10:26.662 --> 00:10:28.744]  There are homeless people sleeping in front of the White House.
[00:10:28.824 --> 00:10:34.690]  And I don't mean down the street, around the corner, across the street from the, you know, from the 7-Eleven.
[00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.933]  I mean, this is the White House and these are the homeless people.
[00:10:38.733 --> 00:10:39.954]  They're that close together.
[00:10:40.234 --> 00:10:43.016]  They sleep in front of the park at the White House.
[00:10:43.036 --> 00:10:47.579]  There are people here in this country who need help who are just completely ignored by the administration.
[00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:55.864]  Once again, we want to help everybody, that's great, but at the same time you have to help the people who are right there, literally, in your own backyard, but they choose not to do that.
[00:10:56.345 --> 00:11:04.510]  And speaking of taking care of things in your own backyard, or lack thereof, we see that a report is finding a sharp increase in veterans who are denied VA benefits.
[00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.092]  And this is the story of one Joshua Bunn.
[00:11:07.432 --> 00:11:17.218]  He was a rifleman in one of the bloodiest valleys in Afghanistan, where his infantry killed hundreds of enemy fighters and lost more comrades than any other battalion in the Marine Corps back in 2009.
[00:11:17.639 --> 00:11:20.641]  And they say after his deployment, he was suicidal.
[00:11:20.681 --> 00:11:22.262]  He was haunted by nightmares.
[00:11:22.302 --> 00:11:22.962]  He went AWOL.
[00:11:23.322 --> 00:11:28.126]  And they say the Marine Corps charged him with misconduct and gave him a less than honorable discharge.
[00:11:28.426 --> 00:11:34.530]  Now they're saying Bunn and guys like him are being known or put on paper as bad paper discharges.
[00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:42.335]  And they say guys like him will not be eligible to receive the benefits from the VA, which brings up a very interesting question.
[00:11:42.936 --> 00:11:50.361]  Yes, they maybe did go AWOL, but at the same time they'd already put their service in, so I guess this would be more of a issue for our military people to tell us.
[00:11:50.701 --> 00:11:53.023]  Do you think that this type of thing is justified?
[00:11:53.043 --> 00:12:02.069]  You can put your comments in the section below and just tell us, do you think that you should still be able to receive benefits if you do go AWOL from the military?
[00:12:02.813 --> 00:12:06.154]  Now, as we're talking about the military, let's talk about the people who they are fighting.
[00:12:06.474 --> 00:12:11.315]  And when it comes to the war on terror, people are saying, do anything you have to do to keep me safe.
[00:12:11.835 --> 00:12:14.135]  Or they want you to believe that.
[00:12:14.255 --> 00:12:15.216]  I'm not one of those people.
[00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.156]  Fill me up at the airport to make me feel safe.
[00:12:17.216 --> 00:12:18.516]  But some people are that way.
[00:12:18.536 --> 00:12:20.557]  I just really don't understand it.
[00:12:20.897 --> 00:12:24.158]  But it's going to the point where people are saying, yeah, you can torture the suspects.
[00:12:24.198 --> 00:12:25.678]  We've seen President Obama come out and admit
[00:12:26.038 --> 00:12:32.606]  We've tortured some folks in a very laissez-faire type of way of going about it, saying that that's what you have to do to keep the homeland safe.
[00:12:32.967 --> 00:12:37.352]  And now many Americans are saying that they are okay with suspects being tortured.
[00:12:37.372 --> 00:12:38.854]  The key word there, suspects.
[00:12:39.475 --> 00:12:42.038]  And this is a poll that reflects the U.S.
[00:12:42.118 --> 00:12:42.419]  public
[00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:48.701]  That is on edge since the massacres of 14 people in San Bernardino, also the recent recent killings in Belgium.
[00:12:49.241 --> 00:12:56.184]  And they say the poll asked the respondents if torture can be justified against suspected terrorists to obtain information about terrorism.
[00:12:56.644 --> 00:13:02.927]  About 25 percent said that it is often justified, while another 38 said it is sometimes justified.
[00:13:03.347 --> 00:13:05.948]  Only 15 percent said that torture should never be used.
[00:13:06.812 --> 00:13:14.214]  Now, as far as torturing the suspects, I'm personally against it for the simple fact that we're talking about suspects.
[00:13:14.234 --> 00:13:16.494]  These are not necessarily the people you're looking for.
[00:13:16.834 --> 00:13:20.615]  It's just like the old adage of a kid who lives in a bad neighborhood, right?
[00:13:20.655 --> 00:13:26.756]  He's walking down the street from school one day and he just happens to be walking past the house while the cops come out and raid it.
[00:13:26.776 --> 00:13:30.397]  And now he gets swept up and he's in the courthouse and the jailhouse just like everybody else.
[00:13:30.417 --> 00:13:31.557]  That's a suspect.
[00:13:31.897 --> 00:13:33.497]  That's why I don't support such measures.
[00:13:33.918 --> 00:13:35.458]  And to anybody who would say, well, you know,
[00:13:36.278 --> 00:13:36.738]  It's worth it.
[00:13:36.758 --> 00:13:40.319]  You know, you have to terrorize these people or torture these people in order to stop the terrorists.
[00:13:40.579 --> 00:13:41.099]  Well, look at this.
[00:13:41.139 --> 00:13:42.200]  This is an old article.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:47.501]  Yemeni prisoner held at Guantanamo Bay for 13 years is victim of mistaken identity.
[00:13:48.021 --> 00:13:49.501]  Once again, suspects.
[00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:53.102]  This is why I'm not a fan of terrorizing or torturing suspects.
[00:13:53.382 --> 00:13:57.083]  Now, they did say that the guy was a jihadi, but he wasn't the guy that they're looking for.
[00:13:57.463 --> 00:13:58.424]  He's a low level guy.
[00:13:58.484 --> 00:13:59.644]  He knew next to nothing.
[00:14:00.064 --> 00:14:02.445]  So they held him for mistaken identity for 13 years.
[00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:04.886]  That's really not that acceptable to me.
[00:14:04.906 --> 00:14:17.412]  And to anybody who says that, hey, you know, you got to break some eggs and make an omelet, well, you go down to your nearest courthouse, your nearest jailhouse, county jail, and volunteer your indentured servitude for the next 13 years and tell me how you feel afterwards of that.
[00:14:17.832 --> 00:14:19.914]  Now, that isn't to say that terrorism isn't real.
[00:14:19.934 --> 00:14:21.815]  We definitely know that terrorism is real.
[00:14:21.875 --> 00:14:23.515]  We have enemies all around us.
[00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:27.517]  I just wish that we had stopped arming our enemies and just go to the straight route of the source.
[00:14:27.898 --> 00:14:32.060]  But now we see that people are trying to join groups like ISIS in alarming numbers.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:37.564]  And we see that a Mississippi woman has attempted to join ISIS and has pled guilty to a terror charge.
[00:14:38.045 --> 00:14:41.207]  And they say that she is a former Mississippi State chemistry major.
[00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:45.631]  She is also a high school cheerleader, honor student, homecoming, the whole nine.
[00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:50.635]  And she has pled guilty of conspiring to provide material support to ISIS.
[00:14:50.655 --> 00:14:52.817]  And they said she will be sentenced at a later date.
[00:14:53.137 --> 00:14:58.860]  It reminds me of all the people we've seen in just the past two or three years accused of trying to join ISIS, Al Qaeda.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.542]  People from seemingly innocent backgrounds.
[00:15:01.582 --> 00:15:07.125]  Americans, people from Australia, young ladies they go to try to join ISIS, they end up dead.
[00:15:07.485 --> 00:15:13.669]  Or the guys, they go out there thinking it'd be a fun way to spend their summer break or spring break and they end up trapped over there.
[00:15:13.689 --> 00:15:15.450]  They're like, hey man, why don't you let me go home?
[00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.392]  I'm like, bro, they're over there killing people who look like them.
[00:15:18.672 --> 00:15:26.014]  People who speak their language, you show up, you know, in your North Face jacket, they're going to know that something's up and you're probably not going to last all that long.
[00:15:26.054 --> 00:15:34.756]  But, I mean, I guess it's like anything, it's like people joining street gangs, but I guess maybe ISIS is a more exotic or exhilarating way to look at it.
[00:15:34.876 --> 00:15:41.878]  I'm not exactly sure what entices these people, but at the same time, it usually, rarely if ever, works out well for them.
[00:15:42.478 --> 00:15:43.659]  Now let's talk about some more terror.
[00:15:43.979 --> 00:15:49.083]  We see that terror deaths have increased eightfold since 2010, a study says.
[00:15:49.604 --> 00:16:01.794]  It says a non-profit investigative project on terrorism found that an average of nearly 30,000 people per year have been killed by terrorists since 2010, when terrorism's death toll was about 3,000.
[00:16:02.934 --> 00:16:06.177]  The authors of the study, which tabulated the numbers through the end of 2015,
[00:16:07.578 --> 00:16:10.661]  Say that the exponential increase shows two troubling trends.
[00:16:11.041 --> 00:16:14.203]  More attacks are happening and they tend to be deadlier than ever.
[00:16:14.384 --> 00:16:16.986]  So you can draw your own conclusions as to why that is.
[00:16:17.046 --> 00:16:23.251]  But I think a definite constant in many of these attacks is the simple fact that we keep arming the people we're supposed to be fighting.
[00:16:23.911 --> 00:16:28.833]  In other news, we see that the Pentagon is concerned about Chinese anti-ship missile firing.
[00:16:29.214 --> 00:16:34.476]  And China has deployed anti-ship cruise missiles on the disputed South China Sea island.
[00:16:34.996 --> 00:16:37.718]  And the missiles are raising new concerns in the Pentagon.
[00:16:38.018 --> 00:16:41.860]  It reminds me of North Korea firing test missiles not that long ago.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:48.003]  And for more news in North Korea, we brought you the report last week of how they took an American student, I believe a college student, like 21 years old,
[00:16:48.983 --> 00:16:56.469]  And they held him captive, gave him 15 years hard labor, they put that in the report so you'd see it, hard labor for stealing a poster.
[00:16:56.769 --> 00:17:09.078]  Now, to all you guys who think socialism is the greatest thing in the world, is better than, you know, a hot knife through butter, think about serving 15 years for stealing a poster, not some ancient, you know, North Korean artifact, but a poster.
[00:17:09.539 --> 00:17:10.519]  And now as we're talking about
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:17.445]  North Korea, they're saying that the citizens need to prepare to chew on roots to make the country great again.
[00:17:17.485 --> 00:17:19.126]  They're saying that a famine is coming.
[00:17:19.146 --> 00:17:25.271]  But if you scroll down to those pictures of Kim, you can definitely see that he's well fed and hasn't missed a meal in quite some time.
[00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:28.273]  Now, before we go to break, I want to go out with this.
[00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:30.354]  This is a video of a Trump
[00:17:31.155 --> 00:17:32.338]  Protester, I guess you would say.
[00:17:32.398 --> 00:17:35.965]  Our crew is out there documenting all the rallies and shenanigans that go on.
[00:17:36.185 --> 00:17:42.798]  We'll show you those videos coming up, but first I want you guys to see this video and just see the insanity that's going on at these rallies.
[00:17:47.459 --> 00:17:48.960]  Smokin' ladies!
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.000]  Smokin' the greens!
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.121]  Smokin' the herbs!
[00:17:51.221 --> 00:17:53.182]  Is that what you think I'm on?
[00:17:53.222 --> 00:17:53.382]  Drugs?
[00:17:53.402 --> 00:17:55.883]  Cause I hate this fascist prick!
[00:17:57.344 --> 00:17:58.824]  I just gave you what you wanted!
[00:17:58.944 --> 00:18:00.705]  I just gave y'all what you wanted!
[00:18:00.805 --> 00:18:02.746]  It's a f****** circus everybody!
[00:18:02.806 --> 00:18:03.106]  Look!
[00:18:03.126 --> 00:18:03.567]  Look!
[00:18:03.627 --> 00:18:05.367]  Look at the monkey!
[00:18:05.407 --> 00:18:07.548]  Look at the monkey!
[00:18:07.709 --> 00:18:08.889]  I did that on purpose!
[00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:10.850]  It's all a f****** show here!
[00:18:13.737 --> 00:18:15.298]  And all you ISIS people threatening us?
[00:18:15.539 --> 00:18:17.000]  Hey, we're not a French newspaper.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:17.700]  Okay?
[00:18:18.001 --> 00:18:20.883]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:18:21.063 --> 00:18:22.765]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:18:22.785 --> 00:18:24.106]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:18:24.446 --> 00:18:25.147]  This is Texas.
[00:18:25.367 --> 00:18:26.188]  You want to threaten me?
[00:18:26.248 --> 00:18:27.369]  You can go straight to hell.
[00:18:27.389 --> 00:18:28.029]  You understand that?
[00:18:28.189 --> 00:18:33.954]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:18:34.394 --> 00:18:38.218]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:19:02.073 --> 00:19:05.797]  Please take a moment to listen to what I'm about to break down very, very carefully.
[00:19:06.518 --> 00:19:14.487]  Because the information I'm about to lay out in just two minutes changed my life and changed the life of many, many people around me.
[00:19:15.008 --> 00:19:21.376]  I was a big sports enthusiast, but loved to eat like a pig when I was 10 years old, up to about 22 or so.
[00:19:22.757 --> 00:19:28.102]  And I ran six miles every other day and lifted weights almost every day and had a great physique.
[00:19:28.262 --> 00:19:34.408]  Then I got into radio and television 21 years ago and got so busy in my work, I stopped working out.
[00:19:34.568 --> 00:19:39.193]  And everything was okay for four or five years, but then suddenly I started putting on pounds every month.
[00:19:39.493 --> 00:19:43.096]  And in the next 10 years, I gained almost 100 pounds.
[00:19:46.107 --> 00:19:56.459]  Then about seven years ago, I began jogging, swimming long distances, and lifting weights again, trying to lose weight, and was only able to lose about 20 of the 98 pounds.
[00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:58.040]  I even changed my diet.
[00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.742]  I even increased the exercise.
[00:19:59.762 --> 00:20:00.303]  It didn't work.
[00:20:01.144 --> 00:20:06.190]  But as soon as I began to get the nutrients and compounds that I needed
[00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:08.177]  My whole life changed.
[00:20:08.798 --> 00:20:14.844]  I've gone from 200 and almost 80 pounds down to about 220 pounds or so.
[00:20:15.445 --> 00:20:16.446]  It is incredible.
[00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:24.635]  And in just the last three years, Super Male Vitality, developed by Dr. Grube for mfulworthslife.com exclusively,
[00:20:25.315 --> 00:20:32.462]  And products like the Survival Shield X2 Nascent Ionine have just done incredible things for my body.
[00:20:32.623 --> 00:20:40.090]  I work out less, even though I'm older, I've lost more weight, my muscles got stronger, my stamina, my libido, and so much more.

[00:23:04.457 --> 00:23:06.479]  Rob Dew has to change out cameras here in a minute.
[00:23:06.499 --> 00:23:10.142]  The battery's going down, so we're going to get as much of the interview as we can now.
[00:23:10.922 --> 00:23:18.488]  They are there in Janesville, Wisconsin, site of where Trump is going to be speaking coming up in a little while.
[00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:20.790]  Rob Dew, tell us what's coming up, my friend.
[00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:28.396]  Yes, this is Rob Dew reporting live from Janesville, Wisconsin, where the Trump rally is going to take place at this Holiday Inn Express to my left.
[00:23:28.886 --> 00:23:31.448]  Uh, Donald Trump is a racist.
[00:23:31.528 --> 00:23:33.329]  That's clear and simple.
[00:23:33.349 --> 00:23:35.910]  He makes these accusations about people that are
[00:23:48.487 --> 00:23:50.749]  Do you have any specifics that you can give me?
[00:24:11.098 --> 00:24:11.798]  You know, patrol.
[00:24:12.299 --> 00:24:13.139]  That was Ted Cruz, I think.
[00:24:13.159 --> 00:24:15.080]  But I think Donald Trump said something similar.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.341]  You know, it's the same thing, I guess.
[00:24:17.481 --> 00:24:19.282]  Okay, but come on now.
[00:24:20.222 --> 00:24:24.344]  He said he wants to stop immigrants coming in.
[00:24:24.824 --> 00:24:26.925]  He said he wants to vet immigrants.
[00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:28.406]  He said there's nothing wrong with having immigrants.
[00:24:28.426 --> 00:24:29.106]  He just wants to vet them.
[00:24:29.685 --> 00:24:29.865]  What?
[00:24:30.466 --> 00:24:31.186]  Oh, oh no!
[00:24:31.366 --> 00:24:31.746]  No, no, no.
[00:24:31.806 --> 00:24:32.707]  He said, he said, no.
[00:24:32.847 --> 00:24:33.487]  And I remember this.
[00:24:33.788 --> 00:24:40.392]  He said, specifically, we're going to, we're going to shut down immigration until we figure out what's going on.
[00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:41.232]  Exactly.
[00:24:41.332 --> 00:24:42.933]  Yeah, they're only checking IDs.
[00:24:43.153 --> 00:24:50.478]  The head of Homeland Security and the FBI said we don't, we can't properly vet Syrian refugees coming into this country and from other Muslim places.
[00:24:50.598 --> 00:24:53.339]  Italy just closed three of its borders with Albania.
[00:24:53.439 --> 00:24:54.220]  Explain this to the idiot.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.541]  Is Italy racist?
[00:24:55.561 --> 00:24:58.022]  The Homeland Security, they're scared of everyone, right?
[00:24:58.543 --> 00:25:04.767]  I mean, they're looking at your emails, they're looking at my emails, like, so... Okay, what about Macedonia just put up a border wall for migrants?
[00:25:04.847 --> 00:25:10.210]  Macedonia, they just put up a border fence essentially to keep migrants coming out because they're being flooded and it's destroying their country.
[00:25:11.091 --> 00:25:11.992]  Does that make it okay?
[00:25:12.372 --> 00:25:13.453]  Well, that doesn't make them racist.
[00:25:13.473 --> 00:25:14.633]  Ask if the city has a front door.
[00:25:14.653 --> 00:25:15.514]  Ask if it has a door.
[00:25:15.534 --> 00:25:16.335]  That doesn't make them racist.
[00:25:16.355 --> 00:25:18.216]  But the comments that you're making are racist.
[00:25:18.276 --> 00:25:19.036]  Ask if it has a door.
[00:25:19.116 --> 00:25:19.597]  That's what they are.
[00:25:20.297 --> 00:25:29.144]  Now, I think what's going on is there's racial division being propagated by a man named George Soros, who you're spotting a lot of his talking points, unfortunately.
[00:25:29.205 --> 00:25:33.228]  He's a billionaire, and you're here against billionaires, but George Soros is a billionaire.
[00:25:33.368 --> 00:25:37.912]  George Soros is, yeah, sure, but- Ask him if he has a front door, it's the same as offense.
[00:25:37.932 --> 00:25:40.834]  Is there any difference between George Soros and Donald Trump?
[00:25:40.874 --> 00:25:42.576]  No, they're just the same side.
[00:25:42.716 --> 00:25:44.497]  They're two different sides of the same coin.
[00:25:44.817 --> 00:25:46.579]  But you're spouting his talking points.
[00:25:46.599 --> 00:25:48.941]  Does George Soros care about-
[00:25:49.461 --> 00:25:51.702]  Ask Ronald McDonald if he has a door.
[00:25:51.782 --> 00:25:52.663]  Ask if he has a door.
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.201]  Does he have a door on his house?
[00:26:21.681 --> 00:26:24.343]  Is there a fence on his yard?
[00:26:24.683 --> 00:26:28.065]  Wealth inequality has gone up over the last 50 years immensely.
[00:26:28.085 --> 00:26:35.249]  And it's because of guys like George Soros and Donald Trump who take jobs out of America and put them into... Actually, Bill Clinton helped take jobs out of America.
[00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:36.810]  This moron has a door on his house.
[00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:38.090]  He's a neoliberal Democrat.
[00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:40.652]  Alright, um, Alex wants to know if you have a door on your house.
[00:26:42.053 --> 00:26:43.974]  Alex Jones is talking to you right there through that camera.
[00:26:43.994 --> 00:26:46.195]  He wants to know if you have a door on your house.
[00:26:46.695 --> 00:26:47.596]  Or a fence in your yard.
[00:26:49.329 --> 00:26:50.591]  Um, I live with my parents.
[00:26:50.631 --> 00:26:50.711]  I'm 18.
[00:26:50.771 --> 00:26:51.672]  I'm in high school.
[00:26:51.992 --> 00:26:53.755]  But you have a door in your house, right?
[00:26:54.395 --> 00:26:55.717]  Is this what conservatives do?
[00:26:55.797 --> 00:26:56.838]  Is they get online?
[00:26:56.858 --> 00:26:58.440]  We're liberals, dumbass.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.321]  We're the real deal.
[00:26:59.341 --> 00:27:00.582]  We're here to save the country, punk.
[00:27:00.603 --> 00:27:01.804]  We built it.
[00:27:01.904 --> 00:27:03.406]  We're the renaissance.
[00:27:03.446 --> 00:27:04.006]  We did it all.
[00:27:04.127 --> 00:27:04.607]  You're an idiot.
[00:27:06.713 --> 00:27:07.033]  Sure.
[00:27:07.373 --> 00:27:07.573]  Okay.
[00:27:07.873 --> 00:27:09.554]  So then what's wrong with having that at your country?
[00:27:09.954 --> 00:27:10.154]  What?
[00:27:10.734 --> 00:27:12.194]  Again, we're not being mean to them, folks.
[00:27:12.214 --> 00:27:13.695]  They're storming the event and stuff.
[00:27:13.935 --> 00:27:15.455]  These groups have been Soros-funded, Hillary-funded.
[00:27:15.475 --> 00:27:16.475]  They've been caught trying to violate.
[00:27:16.515 --> 00:27:17.156]  Let's talk to this moron.
[00:27:17.176 --> 00:27:17.776]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:17.796 --> 00:27:18.256]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:18.276 --> 00:27:18.736]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:18.756 --> 00:27:19.576]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:19.596 --> 00:27:20.056]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:20.076 --> 00:27:20.476]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:20.496 --> 00:27:20.936]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:20.956 --> 00:27:21.497]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:21.517 --> 00:27:22.057]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:22.077 --> 00:27:22.497]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:22.517 --> 00:27:22.937]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:22.957 --> 00:27:23.617]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:23.637 --> 00:27:24.157]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:24.197 --> 00:27:24.777]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:24.797 --> 00:27:25.338]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:25.358 --> 00:27:25.818]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:25.838 --> 00:27:26.258]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:26.278 --> 00:27:26.698]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:26.718 --> 00:27:27.138]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:27.158 --> 00:27:27.938]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:27.958 --> 00:27:28.498]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:28.518 --> 00:27:29.078]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:29.098 --> 00:27:29.659]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:29.679 --> 00:27:30.099]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:30.119 --> 00:27:30.679]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:30.699 --> 00:27:31.399]  No hate in our state
[00:27:32.839 --> 00:27:34.620]  I can tell you a little bit about myself if you want.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.101]  Sure.
[00:27:35.281 --> 00:27:46.608]  A lot of people have been like GM and other companies that have left this area and taken away a lot of the jobs which is why you have a lot of disenfranchised people instead of blaming Donald Trump for it who's actually employed people.
[00:27:46.768 --> 00:27:57.055]  I'm here as a white woman and a mother of two white sons and I don't want to raise my sons in a world shaped by racism and violence and that's the kind of message that Donald Trump has used to empower himself and his base.
[00:27:57.255 --> 00:28:01.178]  Ask her if she knows about tribalism and other groups and if she understands why we have nationalism.
[00:28:02.583 --> 00:28:05.284]  So you think white people are the main problem?
[00:28:05.344 --> 00:28:06.145]  Get these votes!
[00:28:28.479 --> 00:28:29.060]  Are you done?
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.081]  I think she's done.
[00:28:30.382 --> 00:28:31.203]  No, no, let her keep going.
[00:28:31.223 --> 00:28:33.787]  Let's hear the little commie chants and the idiot chants.
[00:28:33.807 --> 00:28:35.469]  I mean, dude, this is pathetic.
[00:28:41.087 --> 00:28:46.808]  Hey, you think we ought to go talk to some of the Donald Trump supporters?
[00:29:10.322 --> 00:29:11.563]  Hey, you wanna interview the Easter Bunny?
[00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:12.984]  You're gonna love this one, Alex.
[00:29:15.006 --> 00:29:16.427]  And I think he's a fan.
[00:29:17.208 --> 00:29:20.511]  Alright, go back and talk to that guy who's like a security guard.
[00:29:20.531 --> 00:29:21.532]  You gotta meet the Easter Bunny.
[00:29:21.552 --> 00:29:23.934]  Alright, we're live on TV.
[00:29:24.814 --> 00:29:25.755]  So tell us why you're here.
[00:29:25.775 --> 00:29:30.679]  Well, I'm here to see a side of insanity here.
[00:29:30.699 --> 00:29:35.864]  I wanted to see how many Democrats were around and how many people were like, for real, going to vote for Trump.
[00:29:36.471 --> 00:29:37.331]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:37.411 --> 00:29:40.452]  So what's your impression of what you're seeing right now?
[00:29:40.832 --> 00:29:44.353]  I don't know, it's pretty peaceful.
[00:29:44.433 --> 00:29:50.194]  I saw some people trying to instigate earlier, it was people from Trump's camp, but you know, nobody's falling for it.
[00:29:50.374 --> 00:29:51.414]  Ask him if he was ever taking LSD.
[00:29:51.434 --> 00:29:52.675]  Do you think Trump supporters are the problem?
[00:29:53.095 --> 00:29:53.715]  Trump supporters?
[00:29:55.455 --> 00:30:00.416]  No, I mean, I just think they don't know what's going on.
[00:30:01.897 --> 00:30:03.717]  I mean, I really don't understand.
[00:30:04.525 --> 00:30:10.908]  How you could be behind that and sell the presidency and support half of the garbage that he talks.
[00:30:10.948 --> 00:30:14.350]  Hey, ask him why the power elite worldwide and the communist Chinese are against him.
[00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:15.370]  You see it from both sides.
[00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.111]  You see the Republicans and the Democrats hate him.
[00:30:17.511 --> 00:30:19.312]  Wouldn't that make you just want to pause for a second?
[00:30:20.113 --> 00:30:23.594]  Maybe this guy is talking some sense and some on, you know, several levels.
[00:30:23.894 --> 00:30:27.236]  No, he's not speaking... Ask this guy what he thinks of the Manson family.
[00:30:27.256 --> 00:30:30.898]  Actually, I have a conspiracy theory that Hillary paid him to run just because
[00:30:32.655 --> 00:30:33.936]  Months ago it was a joke.
[00:30:33.996 --> 00:30:36.137]  That's what I thought a year ago.
[00:30:36.217 --> 00:30:37.717]  Yeah, you know what, actually we thought that too.
[00:30:37.917 --> 00:30:40.038]  But he has brought out her husband's sexcapades.
[00:30:41.219 --> 00:30:43.580]  Which I think is pretty damaging to what she's doing right now.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.780]  Well, yeah, I suppose so.
[00:30:45.841 --> 00:30:47.601]  I mean, I wouldn't vote for Hillary.
[00:30:47.621 --> 00:30:49.442]  Ask him what he thinks of Charlie Manchin.
[00:30:49.862 --> 00:30:54.664]  Actually, Trump, when he started, it was sort of like a protest run.
[00:30:54.864 --> 00:30:58.846]  As a candidate, I think he was surprised at the number of people... Ask him if he takes LSD in that outfit.
[00:30:58.886 --> 00:30:59.826]  I thought it was a joke.
[00:31:00.607 --> 00:31:01.147]  I really did.
[00:31:02.088 --> 00:31:08.873]  But, Wisconsin for example, obviously there is, there's a history here of people voting against their better interest.
[00:31:10.093 --> 00:31:15.237]  Okay, so Alex wants to know if you take LSD in that bunny suit, what do you think of the Manson family?
[00:31:16.277 --> 00:31:16.518]  Who?
[00:31:17.358 --> 00:31:18.699]  Alex Jones, you're live right now.
[00:31:19.019 --> 00:31:20.140]  Oh, hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.201]  Good, we're doing well.
[00:31:22.475 --> 00:31:23.595]  He said we're doing well.
[00:31:23.675 --> 00:31:24.296]  No, no, no.
[00:31:24.336 --> 00:31:27.497]  I'm not on drugs and I'm not a Manson fan.
[00:31:27.897 --> 00:31:28.637]  What's your job?
[00:31:28.657 --> 00:31:29.938]  What do you do?
[00:31:30.578 --> 00:31:31.078]  I'm an artist.
[00:31:31.158 --> 00:31:31.618]  You're an artist?
[00:31:31.979 --> 00:31:32.199]  Yeah.
[00:31:32.679 --> 00:31:33.399]  Does that surprise you?
[00:31:33.879 --> 00:31:34.479]  No, not at all.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.500]  Show us some of your signs.
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.280]  Let me ask you this.
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.140]  Who's more handsome?
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.322]  Emperor Palpatine or Darth Vader?
[00:31:40.342 --> 00:31:41.702]  My favorite Ben Franklin quote.
[00:31:42.022 --> 00:31:43.343]  Oh yeah, he's got a Ben Franklin quote.
[00:31:43.523 --> 00:31:44.823]  Alright, who's more handsome?
[00:31:44.883 --> 00:31:46.524]  Emperor Palpatine or who was the other one?
[00:31:48.607 --> 00:31:49.347]  Who was the other one, Alex?
[00:31:49.367 --> 00:31:49.948]  Darth Vader!
[00:31:50.688 --> 00:31:51.728]  Oh, who's more handsome?
[00:31:51.828 --> 00:31:53.069]  Emperor Palpatine or Darth Vader?
[00:31:54.189 --> 00:31:54.690]  Alex Jones.
[00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:57.151]  Oh, he said Alex Jones!
[00:31:57.251 --> 00:31:58.031]  You won, Alex!
[00:31:58.251 --> 00:31:59.792]  Oh my gosh, this is ridiculous.
[00:31:59.812 --> 00:32:03.873]  Hey, asking this, doesn't he see that Trump is a populist manifestation just like Sanders is?
[00:32:04.213 --> 00:32:06.735]  Whether you support him or not, the power structure is against him.
[00:32:07.415 --> 00:32:09.316]  Alright, I kind of asked him that before.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.442]  So right now, it looks like there's a left and a right populist candidate.
[00:32:14.462 --> 00:32:15.422]  We got Trump and Sanders.
[00:32:15.803 --> 00:32:16.583]  Why do you think that is?
[00:32:16.643 --> 00:32:18.324]  You let me know.
[00:32:18.364 --> 00:32:19.144]  Why do you think that is?
[00:32:19.444 --> 00:32:20.405]  Well, I don't know.
[00:32:20.705 --> 00:32:25.608]  This is the first election in a long time where there's been a full swing of the pendulum.
[00:32:26.448 --> 00:32:33.952]  You know, we had eight years of the far right with Bush, the Bush dynasty continuing, and
[00:32:35.503 --> 00:32:42.227]  Uh, you know, I'm sorry, but I kind of think that our president administration is very centrist at best.
[00:32:42.347 --> 00:32:48.990]  There were a lot of things that President Obama could have done, he should have done, and he didn't.
[00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:51.691]  He played it safe, you know?
[00:32:51.851 --> 00:32:52.392]  And I get that.
[00:32:52.412 --> 00:32:53.472]  Like droning kids?
[00:33:03.556 --> 00:33:06.938]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:14.443]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:33:15.044 --> 00:33:23.409]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:27.772]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:33:28.092 --> 00:33:33.456]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:33:33.676 --> 00:33:34.497]  We're good to go.

[00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:07.152]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:07.413 --> 00:35:21.859]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:22.819]  We're good to go.
[00:35:43.365 --> 00:35:51.211]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:51.371 --> 00:35:56.796]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a 6-day liver detox.
[00:35:56.816 --> 00:36:00.338]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:00.518 --> 00:36:04.522]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:04.642 --> 00:36:08.545]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:08.865 --> 00:36:09.045]  I'm good.
[00:37:05.553 --> 00:37:24.504]  Drumroll please ladies and gentlemen there are hundreds of products out there many of them I think are great many of them I've promoted and will still promote but I wanted and it's why it took us two years in the almost four years of Infowarslife.com to come out with this and it from our research is the most affordable
[00:37:26.397 --> 00:37:33.579]  And is the highest quality, and the most absorbable, and is simply over-the-top amazing, and it's plant-derived.
[00:37:33.979 --> 00:37:37.500]  And ladies and gentlemen, it took us two years.
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.541]  There were all sorts of brands that let us private label immediately.
[00:37:40.861 --> 00:37:43.182]  We didn't take the easy road, even though there's some great stuff out there.
[00:37:46.021 --> 00:37:48.522]  We went and brought you concentrated.
[00:37:49.203 --> 00:37:52.644]  It's got the amino acids, the vitamins, the minerals, everything.
[00:37:52.684 --> 00:37:57.767]  And it's something that my children, we got the test batches over the last six months and we have a bunch of different flavors.
[00:37:57.787 --> 00:38:01.269]  We said, no, we have the best flavor ever in fruit punch.
[00:38:01.889 --> 00:38:11.274]  Ladies and gentlemen, Anthony Gucciardi, this is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:38:12.336 --> 00:38:23.143]  Unveiled, Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula 30 Servings 240.SG Fruit Punch Flavored Dietary Supplement.
[00:38:23.463 --> 00:38:24.504]  It is simply amazing.
[00:38:24.584 --> 00:38:25.564]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:38:25.784 --> 00:38:26.725]  We have a limited run.
[00:38:26.745 --> 00:38:28.886]  It won't have more in for a month at least.
[00:38:28.906 --> 00:38:32.008]  This is a limited run and we are so excited about this.
[00:38:32.108 --> 00:38:33.249]  Anthony, you have the floor.
[00:38:33.489 --> 00:38:36.171]  Tell people about Vitamin Mineral Fusion right now.
[00:38:36.591 --> 00:38:37.512]  Stuff is the real deal.
[00:38:37.552 --> 00:38:45.316]  I think if people could see how many different containers we've got back there, probably about 20 or 30 different renditions of this over two years.
[00:38:45.536 --> 00:38:51.579]  And the reason for it is because there's a million different products like this out there that they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:38:52.139 --> 00:39:05.222]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy gross stuff.
[00:39:05.642 --> 00:39:08.063]  And you can put it in your drink every morning, I put it in my protein shake.
[00:39:08.643 --> 00:39:14.125]  It is the platinum standard in my view of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:39:14.165 --> 00:39:17.185]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:39:17.225 --> 00:39:19.426]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something this good.
[00:39:20.106 --> 00:39:26.508]  Yeah, we're not going to get into the details of how some products are made, but let me tell you, okay?
[00:39:26.528 --> 00:39:28.009]  We can't have fucked up one of those two.
[00:39:28.549 --> 00:39:29.690]  Let me tell you, all right?
[00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:35.452]  We've worked here with two of the leading manufacturers on this that we originally wanted to do this product with.
[00:39:35.812 --> 00:39:42.274]  And they said, sure, we're just going to do a process that we use with a lot of the big guys, and it involves this, this, and this.
[00:39:42.314 --> 00:39:44.175]  And I was like, wait, wait, wait, let's take a step back.
[00:39:44.835 --> 00:39:46.216]  You did what to the product?
[00:39:46.616 --> 00:39:48.618]  You did what to get it to that state?
[00:39:49.218 --> 00:39:49.578]  No way.
[00:39:49.658 --> 00:39:50.078]  No thanks.
[00:39:50.319 --> 00:39:53.981]  So we had to go and find our own custom formula, and it took two years.
[00:39:54.021 --> 00:39:55.702]  We had to find a manufacturer willing to do it.
[00:39:56.222 --> 00:39:58.164]  It was a quest, okay?
[00:39:58.184 --> 00:39:59.905]  Anthony, you really are a trailblazer.
[00:40:00.365 --> 00:40:00.705]  Thank you.
[00:40:00.925 --> 00:40:04.667]  Noami, you spent so much time, flew places, went through hell to do this.
[00:40:05.128 --> 00:40:06.448]  Two years, and we have it.
[00:40:06.488 --> 00:40:06.909]  We have it.
[00:40:07.229 --> 00:40:08.549]  And there's a lot of other great stuff out there.
[00:40:08.609 --> 00:40:13.012]  This is just the best tasting, super clean, super natural.
[00:40:13.132 --> 00:40:13.972]  It is amazing.
[00:40:14.272 --> 00:40:17.154]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multivitamin Formulation.
[00:40:17.254 --> 00:40:23.557]  And it's the same or more of the vitamins and minerals than some of the other brands that are out there where it's bigger containers.
[00:40:23.637 --> 00:40:24.358]  It's concentrated.
[00:40:24.938 --> 00:40:25.379]  Exactly.
[00:40:25.439 --> 00:40:29.342]  We could get into techniques for hours and hours, but some companies are gonna... There's no filler.
[00:40:29.743 --> 00:40:36.209]  Yeah, some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler it looks like there's a lot.
[00:40:36.409 --> 00:40:37.651]  This is ultra-concentrated.
[00:40:37.671 --> 00:40:38.772]  We're not playing games here.
[00:40:39.132 --> 00:40:40.413]  Okay, this is... Well, that's my philosophy.
[00:40:40.433 --> 00:40:41.054]  That's your philosophy.
[00:40:41.314 --> 00:40:43.356]  But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:40:43.937 --> 00:40:48.341]  And there's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:40:48.702 --> 00:40:49.923]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:40:50.083 --> 00:40:52.766]  This is just the very best we can bring you.
[00:40:52.786 --> 00:40:57.171]  And when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:40:57.731 --> 00:41:03.978]  Because, quite frankly, some of the other powders my kids get healthier on, they're great, they just don't... Why does this taste so good?
[00:41:04.218 --> 00:41:04.759]  No, exactly.
[00:41:04.819 --> 00:41:07.060]  And this can be taken in conjunction with other stuff.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.122]  Not that there aren't other great products out there.
[00:41:09.142 --> 00:41:09.803]  There certainly are.
[00:41:10.223 --> 00:41:16.188]  But some big products, I was just amazed what they were actually doing in the manufacturing process.
[00:41:16.328 --> 00:41:18.610]  This goes above and beyond the stuff you don't see.
[00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:22.473]  You just have to trust us, take our word for it, because you know the standard of quality that we work with.
[00:41:22.973 --> 00:41:25.655]  But this has pretty much, in my view, everything you need.
[00:41:25.675 --> 00:41:27.457]  We don't want to be nasty, and we're not going to be nasty.
[00:41:27.797 --> 00:41:28.037]  Yes.
[00:41:28.077 --> 00:41:30.100]  Quite frankly, we'd sell more if we did, and we're just not doing it.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:30.780]  Exactly.
[00:41:31.181 --> 00:41:37.827]  And it tastes great, and instead of maybe costing us pennies for a container of this, it costs an actually large amount.
[00:41:37.847 --> 00:41:42.412]  The margins aren't the best on this one, but instead, you know, we flew the places, we went to the manufacturer.
[00:41:42.512 --> 00:41:46.416]  No one is putting this much product in a container this size for this price.
[00:41:46.596 --> 00:41:46.797]  Yes.
[00:41:47.357 --> 00:41:50.560]  In fact, there's stuff a hundred bucks for something similar that isn't as good.
[00:41:51.221 --> 00:41:52.342]  Anthony, I gotta hand it to you.
[00:41:52.702 --> 00:41:58.425]  And of course, this is made by one of the biggest, most successful, healthy, clean, natural labs in the country.
[00:41:58.525 --> 00:41:59.906]  And it's our exclusive formula.
[00:42:00.126 --> 00:42:01.187]  No one else can copy this.
[00:42:01.267 --> 00:42:03.248]  It is a proprietary manufacturing process.
[00:42:03.328 --> 00:42:04.769]  It's a unique delivery system.
[00:42:05.129 --> 00:42:09.992]  The powder is done in such a way that it's a proprietary process where we just don't spray chemicals on it.
[00:42:10.572 --> 00:42:18.436]  Okay, it's done in such a way that we believe it's maximized for absorption, it's maximized for bio-usability, bio-availability.
[00:42:18.496 --> 00:42:22.617]  Let's talk about what's in, what's in in fullwarslife.com, Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:42:22.637 --> 00:42:24.078]  You can also call toll free 888-253-3139 to get it.
[00:42:24.098 --> 00:42:24.578]  Just get...
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:29.320]  The product.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.261]  Try it for yourself.
[00:42:30.441 --> 00:42:31.741]  It will blow you away.
[00:42:32.762 --> 00:42:36.644]  Just imagine giving this to your children every morning or every evening or twice a day.
[00:42:37.144 --> 00:42:43.427]  They are going to love getting their minerals, their multivitamins, their amino acids, the trace elements all at one time.
[00:42:43.847 --> 00:42:44.508]  Absorbable.
[00:42:45.708 --> 00:42:52.692]  In fact, the developers, manufacturers feel safe for us to even put on the label the fact about the absorption.
[00:42:52.732 --> 00:42:53.472]  Tell folks.
[00:42:53.772 --> 00:43:10.349]  Yeah, I was actually blown away because I had to go back yesterday and change a few things on the product page because the manufacturer said, no, we're so confident in this, we will back you in saying that this unique delivery process and the standard of processing we're doing, we're willing to back you on saying this is for maximum absorption.
[00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:15.211]  And I've never seen a manufacturer come up, they're not even, they're really not even supposed to do things like that sometimes.
[00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:18.172]  They said, look, we're so confident in this, we're going to back you 100%.
[00:43:18.332 --> 00:43:21.833]  And by the way, the vitamins and minerals and things in it give it the flavor.
[00:43:22.153 --> 00:43:22.353]  Yes.
[00:43:22.493 --> 00:43:23.614]  There's a tiny bit of stevia.
[00:43:23.854 --> 00:43:24.754]  Well, exactly.
[00:43:24.874 --> 00:43:27.855]  So again, what's funny is we've had so many renditions of this.
[00:43:28.255 --> 00:43:29.515]  I just said the same thing.
[00:43:30.236 --> 00:43:33.597]  Your dad, who's a doctor of dental surgery, came over and asked the same question.
[00:43:33.897 --> 00:43:35.277]  And I said, I almost said stevia.
[00:43:35.297 --> 00:43:37.518]  I said, wait, no, we went even more neurotic.
[00:43:38.157 --> 00:43:44.419]  By the way, I want to thank our enemies for attacking us on things that probably really aren't even bad, but that some of the health Nazis don't want.
[00:43:44.779 --> 00:43:46.519]  That's why we've gone total health Nazi.
[00:43:46.719 --> 00:43:49.960]  This is the most over-the-top, clean, neurotic stuff you can find.
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.401]  Tell folks what's in it, Anthony.
[00:43:51.421 --> 00:43:55.242]  Okay, so we originally were going to do the stevia, but then we went even more neurotic
[00:43:55.942 --> 00:43:59.705]  to a patented xylitol that's corn-free.
[00:43:59.785 --> 00:44:02.927]  Because you could say, oh, well, the corn and xylitol, you know, it could be GMO.
[00:44:02.967 --> 00:44:03.208]  No, no.
[00:44:03.528 --> 00:44:06.950]  We went to the only corn-free xylitol on the planet.
[00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:10.853]  Of course, xylitol is good for your teeth, it can fight cavities, all that kind of stuff.
[00:44:11.133 --> 00:44:23.263]  This is the trademarked, patented kind that we had to pay money to license, pay up front to license into our product for the manufacturer, ship it to the manufacturer, and then use that instead of... And that's why we run out of so many of our products sometimes, is because
[00:44:23.923 --> 00:44:33.557]  At this neurotic, super clean California level with our products and things, which is the highest standard, it's really hard to actually source it and get it and have it and jump to the hoops and sign the agreements and do it all.
[00:44:33.817 --> 00:44:34.578]  And it's expensive.
[00:44:34.599 --> 00:44:36.281]  You have to pay licensing agreements.
[00:44:37.262 --> 00:44:38.463]  Now tell folks how much this is.
[00:44:39.144 --> 00:44:40.244]  So this is $40.
[00:44:40.284 --> 00:44:40.244]  $39.95.
[00:44:40.304 --> 00:44:50.232]  $39.95.
[00:44:41.465 --> 00:44:50.232]  And the funny part is, we had the meeting, remember, with the manufacturers, and they said, no, no, you're crazy.
[00:44:50.732 --> 00:44:52.093]  Sell it for $60 or $70.
[00:44:52.714 --> 00:44:54.876]  They said, even if we were going to sell it, we'd sell it for $60, $70.
[00:44:54.976 --> 00:44:58.799]  Because they said, it's so expensive already for you to make, plus there's the perceived value.
[00:44:59.059 --> 00:45:00.000]  People want to pay more.
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:00.640]  No, I'm not doing it.
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:04.002]  And it's exclusive, you can't go out and have this anywhere, you know, made anywhere else.
[00:45:04.463 --> 00:45:10.167]  But, as usual, I'm actually kind of blown away by... That's right, no reviews yet, no reviews.
[00:45:10.187 --> 00:45:12.428]  Be the first to get it, and believe me, it's going to sell out in days.
[00:45:12.849 --> 00:45:19.493]  No, you are literally, literally obsessed with people getting the lowest prices, and I'm not just saying that in some weird cheesy way.
[00:45:19.654 --> 00:45:20.454]  We have arguments about it.
[00:45:20.474 --> 00:45:28.160]  No, no, we've had arguments about it, and it's not that I ever really want to charge people more, it just hurts me to see you pay so much for something, and the margins be so low.
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.502]  At the same time, you know what I mean, working all this?
[00:45:30.542 --> 00:45:32.163]  But I totally get it and I totally agree.
[00:45:32.183 --> 00:45:34.486]  Well, I love our audience and I want them to love this stuff.
[00:45:34.506 --> 00:45:37.729]  I want it to work really well and I want them to then buy even more and fund us.
[00:45:37.969 --> 00:45:38.129]  Yeah.
[00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:39.811]  I mean, that's just in my guts the right thing to do.
[00:45:41.209 --> 00:45:41.690]  No, it's true.
[00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:48.336]  And I'll tell you what, if you're taking something else that you like, and I'm sure it's a great product, and this can be... You can take this in conjunction!
[00:45:48.536 --> 00:45:50.938]  Take it in conjunction, but taste this.
[00:45:51.479 --> 00:45:52.060]  Taste the difference.
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:53.661]  I've never tasted anything this good.
[00:45:54.242 --> 00:45:54.822]  Taste the difference.
[00:45:55.163 --> 00:45:56.123]  I've never tasted anything this good.
[00:45:56.244 --> 00:45:58.866]  And it's not, it's not like there's big chunks of sediment.
[00:45:58.886 --> 00:46:00.688]  This was sitting back there for... Anthony, congratulations.
[00:46:00.708 --> 00:46:01.088]  Thank you.
[00:46:01.328 --> 00:46:02.550]  This is the best product we've ever made.
[00:46:03.703 --> 00:46:04.924]  I mean, this is over the top.
[00:46:05.304 --> 00:46:06.264]  Two years, folks.
[00:46:06.824 --> 00:46:07.325]  Two years.
[00:46:07.425 --> 00:46:08.105]  I'm gonna skip the break.
[00:46:08.145 --> 00:46:08.485]  I have to.
[00:46:08.505 --> 00:46:10.166]  This is just so important.
[00:46:10.966 --> 00:46:11.606]  No more today.
[00:46:11.626 --> 00:46:12.467]  I'm a bad person.
[00:46:12.547 --> 00:46:14.468]  It's just, this is so important.
[00:46:14.928 --> 00:46:18.449]  Hey, who else skips their breaks pretty routinely like that?
[00:46:18.529 --> 00:46:19.410]  Well, I have to quit doing it.
[00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:20.310]  I actually have to quit doing it.
[00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:20.730]  Losing money.
[00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.091]  I have to quit doing it.
[00:46:22.931 --> 00:46:25.154]  Uh, but, but, you know, at the same time, those are network breaks.
[00:46:25.174 --> 00:46:25.935]  They're not local breaks.
[00:46:26.115 --> 00:46:28.537]  It's important to support our local affiliates and the network and the rest of it.
[00:46:28.557 --> 00:46:31.701]  But quite frankly, I could just go to a three-hour show with no ads.
[00:46:32.021 --> 00:46:33.303]  That's the way the internet works right now.
[00:46:33.323 --> 00:46:40.611]  In fact, I've thought about just completely leaving talk radio and TV and everything and just having a three-hour, you know, show in here that streamed everybody and that's the model.
[00:46:40.651 --> 00:46:41.812]  So I'm kind of moving to that.
[00:46:42.092 --> 00:46:42.892]  I love our affiliates.
[00:46:42.912 --> 00:46:46.254]  I'm going to keep a radio model for everybody and TV model at least for a while.
[00:46:47.034 --> 00:46:54.217]  But we are more and more just going to absolutely commercial free stuff where we just plug a few times in the hour the products we use and believe in.
[00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:04.012]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.552 --> 00:47:06.835]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.116 --> 00:47:14.966]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.228 --> 00:48:42.789]  I don't know.
[00:49:10.356 --> 00:49:14.279]  You keep it.
[00:49:14.299 --> 00:49:14.760]  You keep it.
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:16.221]  I don't want it back.
[00:49:52.133 --> 00:49:54.034]  Non-whites only need apply.
[00:49:54.254 --> 00:50:07.901]  So read the casting call for Hamilton, a Broadway hit that hijacks the genius of the founding fathers and superimposes them onto minorities, now being heavily scrutinized by New York civil rights attorney Randolph McLaughlin.
[00:50:08.081 --> 00:50:11.983]  What if they put an ad out that said whites only need apply?
[00:50:12.444 --> 00:50:15.466]  Why African-Americans, Latinos, Asians will be outraged.
[00:50:15.486 --> 00:50:21.489]  You cannot advertise showing that you have a preference for one racial group over another.
[00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:30.835]  As an artistic question, sure, he can cast whomever he wants to cast, but he has to give every actor eligible for the role an opportunity to try.
[00:50:31.115 --> 00:50:39.319]  Nonetheless, the cast was welcomed with open arms by the George Soros-funded Black Lives Matter crowd stumbling around the White House.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:45.823]  Seven years ago, Lin-Manuel Miranda came to the White House poetry jam.
[00:50:46.243 --> 00:50:48.284]  This is definitely the room where it happened, right here.
[00:50:48.304 --> 00:50:51.306]  This is it, right here.
[00:50:52.526 --> 00:50:55.228]  I'm actually working on a hip-hop album.
[00:50:56.208 --> 00:51:01.512]  It's a concept album about the life of someone I think embodies hip-hop, Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton.
[00:51:02.657 --> 00:51:04.138]  You laugh, but it's true!
[00:51:04.158 --> 00:51:06.481]  Hamilton is an amazing story that is beautifully told.
[00:51:26.138 --> 00:51:32.744]  Through Hamilton, Lin-Manuel reveals all the drama and the glory, the heartbreak that run through our nation's history.
[00:51:33.782 --> 00:51:41.548]  And he shows us that the icons in our history books were real people with real brilliance, but also with real flaws.
[00:51:42.649 --> 00:51:46.572]  So really Hamilton teaches us history the way it really should be taught.
[00:51:47.253 --> 00:51:52.477]  The entertainment industry's lack of creative minority roles has become par for the course.
[00:51:52.817 --> 00:51:57.101]  A situation Chris Rock recently brought to the fore at the Academy Awards.
[00:51:57.601 --> 00:51:58.823]  Is Hollywood racist?
[00:51:59.343 --> 00:52:04.069]  You're damn right Hollywood's racist, but it ain't the racist that you've grown accustomed to.
[00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:07.914]  Hollywood is sorority racist.
[00:52:08.594 --> 00:52:12.880]  However, diversity in American entertainment is booming in the U.S.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:17.182]  While overseas audiences have yet to grasp the concept.
[00:52:17.542 --> 00:52:24.885]  The Hollywood Reporter writes, Sony Pictures TV casting director Don Steinberg says, it's colorblind casting.
[00:52:25.225 --> 00:52:30.087]  There used to be a time when it had to be written that way to look for an actor with a specific ethnicity.
[00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:33.328]  Now it's just who is the best actor for the role.
[00:52:33.509 --> 00:52:39.131]  But when trying to sell overseas, American shows are finding the color barrier is still there.
[00:52:39.491 --> 00:52:47.677]  Marion Edwards, President of International TV at Fox, says these shows are a reflection of our society, but they are not a reflection of all societies.
[00:52:48.098 --> 00:52:48.938]  Take Empire.
[00:52:49.298 --> 00:52:53.642]  Fox's hip-hop drama appeared to be a slam dunk for the international market.
[00:52:54.142 --> 00:52:56.304]  Empire has been a global flop.
[00:52:56.744 --> 00:53:04.549]  The New York City human rights law that the Broadway play Hamilton may have violated was enacted to defend against discrimination.
[00:53:04.789 --> 00:53:12.374]  The law states it is unlawful for an employer, because of the actual or perceived race of any person, to discriminate.
[00:53:12.774 --> 00:53:19.839]  Essentially, entertainment supposedly aggressively tackling stereotypes has, in all of its arrogance,
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:35.645]  I love how the media makes news by buying into the FBI's disinfo.
[00:53:38.347 --> 00:53:44.289]  I've read in tech magazines for years, and hear about it all the time, that they can crack into iPads, iPhones.
[00:53:44.609 --> 00:53:47.110]  They don't try to get in through the front interface.
[00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:48.651]  That's uncrackable, basically.
[00:53:51.636 --> 00:53:56.737]  They get in by getting into the little hard drive or solid state system inside or through the apps.
[00:53:58.698 --> 00:54:00.498]  There's a whole bunch of ways to get into it.
[00:54:01.518 --> 00:54:02.638]  And again, I'm not a tech guy.
[00:54:02.758 --> 00:54:07.439]  I read the tech journals and I told you months ago, I said, they've got the back door over and over again.
[00:54:07.919 --> 00:54:08.800]  This is pure bull.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:15.781]  They want a built-in encryption key that's quicker, but they can get into these in an hour, two hours, three hours.
[00:54:16.121 --> 00:54:17.762]  If it's an old version, pretty fast.
[00:54:18.142 --> 00:54:19.142]  Might take them a day.
[00:54:20.751 --> 00:54:21.731]  It's a hassle for him.
[00:54:22.332 --> 00:54:23.912]  It's kind of like a steel door on a house.
[00:54:24.473 --> 00:54:26.053]  It takes a battering ram to take it down.
[00:54:26.974 --> 00:54:28.014]  And we were proven right again.
[00:54:28.394 --> 00:54:38.019]  Proven right again, by the way, we first broke here four years ago with Tosh Plumlee, who got threatened by the Justice Department after he came on, just saying.
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:44.506]  And then got attacked by John McCain on national news for saying, we're backing Al Qaeda in Syria.
[00:54:44.567 --> 00:54:46.048]  We're giving them weapons from Benghazi.
[00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:47.510]  It's all turned out to be true.
[00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:53.077]  And then of course, crazy McCain called Tosh Plumlee a nut, even though he's a famous whistleblower.
[00:54:53.749 --> 00:55:00.836]  Who was still in the CIA until three and a half years ago when he resigned as a contractor of 40 plus years to be able to come on the show.
[00:55:01.477 --> 00:55:03.159]  He retired to be able to come on and talk about it.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:08.685]  And he said, I don't care if it's classified, it's illegal to give ISIS and Al Qaeda weapons.
[00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:09.726]  It was before it was called ISIS.
[00:55:10.984 --> 00:55:28.336]  So he came on, he let it all out, and then we had a Lieutenant Colonel from the Marine Corps, recently retired on, who's been physically attacked, you name it, threatened, because the base he was over, he learned, was conduiting weapons into Mexico and is currently doing it.
[00:55:29.777 --> 00:55:30.637]  The base he was over.
[00:55:31.318 --> 00:55:34.040]  This guy formerly headed up Guantanamo Bay.
[00:55:35.681 --> 00:55:36.662]  That's high level, folks.
[00:55:37.042 --> 00:55:38.163]  That isn't a pencil pusher.
[00:55:39.005 --> 00:55:41.868]  Okay, imagine what he knows he can't tell us because it's classified.
[00:55:42.288 --> 00:55:46.551]  He was on with us, the interview is on InfoWars.com, with Brian Terry's brother.
[00:55:49.674 --> 00:55:50.895]  So, this is a big deal.
[00:55:52.096 --> 00:55:57.060]  Breaking Fast and Furious was secret program to ship arms to Middle East terrorists.
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:59.362]  Investigation reveals armed shipments ongoing.
[00:55:59.422 --> 00:56:00.003]  That's the key.
[00:56:00.083 --> 00:56:01.464]  It's ongoing.
[00:56:01.704 --> 00:56:04.927]  The military knows, the ATF knows, they don't want to be part of it.
[00:56:05.868 --> 00:56:09.272]  Remember, you see El Chapo with 50 cows, you name it.
[00:56:09.593 --> 00:56:14.219]  They go through Mexico and then on to Plains, in to the Middle East.
[00:56:14.419 --> 00:56:16.101]  Because our own military won't be part of it.
[00:56:16.502 --> 00:56:17.683]  They've been saying that for four years.
[00:56:18.044 --> 00:56:22.370]  So they fence it through Mexico and have cartels do it.
[00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:24.032]  And man, those cartels are evil.
[00:56:26.155 --> 00:56:29.536]  Just when I think they can't go to a new low, they're involved arming.
[00:56:29.576 --> 00:56:34.898]  And, of course, you've seen the threats with El Chapo with ISIS when he's caught them getting his cocaine.
[00:56:35.178 --> 00:56:36.658]  He's shipping cocaine in theirs, too.
[00:56:36.898 --> 00:56:38.499]  And they've been taking his cocaine, he threatened them.
[00:56:38.559 --> 00:56:38.959]  Remember that?
[00:56:39.139 --> 00:56:40.440]  About two months ago, from jail.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.321]  Your little boys, I'm gonna kill you.
[00:56:43.361 --> 00:56:44.521]  You don't know what terror is?
[00:56:45.901 --> 00:56:47.442]  No, I know what terror is, El Chapo.
[00:56:47.502 --> 00:56:52.824]  It's ISIS cutting little kids' heads off and throwing priests off buildings and murdering nuns in old folks' homes.
[00:56:53.024 --> 00:56:53.964]  Shame on all of you.
[00:56:55.401 --> 00:56:57.642]  Let's go to Adon Salazar.
[00:56:57.962 --> 00:56:59.343]  Adon, powerful article.
[00:56:59.583 --> 00:57:02.825]  You dovetail it with their article that The Hill wouldn't publish.
[00:57:03.085 --> 00:57:04.066]  We need to get this out.
[00:57:04.766 --> 00:57:06.307]  Amazing points that you have in there.
[00:57:07.708 --> 00:57:09.229]  What do you want to impart to the audience?
[00:57:09.249 --> 00:57:11.350]  I mean, all I'm saying is we need to get this out to everybody.
[00:57:12.679 --> 00:57:20.545]  Right, like you were saying, yesterday we did have Lieutenant Colonel Matt Smith-Meck on, and he's a really highly accredited investigator.
[00:57:21.046 --> 00:57:23.287]  As you said, he did work at Guantanamo Bay.
[00:57:23.327 --> 00:57:32.595]  He was actually a tribunal member in charge of reviewing the detention of enemy combatants, so he's as high up as you can probably go.
[00:57:32.615 --> 00:57:35.057]  He's got a whole list of accreditations there.
[00:57:35.457 --> 00:57:37.879]  Well, he was actually the head of the base at one time, yes.
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:41.441]  I mean, it's a big deal he's coming out with this and there's no media coverage.
[00:57:41.461 --> 00:57:54.606]  Through the course of his investigation with Kent Terry, the brother of slain Border Patrol agent Brian Terry, he discovered that Brian Terry was about to go public with what he knew about Fast and Furious.
[00:57:55.527 --> 00:58:02.470]  And that was the fact that, or the possibility that it might be a cover for an international gun smuggling ring.
[00:58:03.154 --> 00:58:06.255]  And he's the guy that began to expose it and got killed, and the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:58:06.276 --> 00:58:10.658]  They agree that he was probably murdered, not as an accident, but to cover up his investigation.
[00:58:11.878 --> 00:58:23.584]  That's right, and through the course of Lieutenant Smith-Mack's investigation, he's discovered that Terry was ready to blow the whistle.
[00:58:24.716 --> 00:58:28.218]  And he died 10 minutes into his last shift.
[00:58:28.959 --> 00:58:31.080]  He had premonitions.
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:39.726]  He was telling his mother that he had bad feeling about going back out there and that he had met some bad agents and that he told the agents, said, don't worry about me.
[00:58:39.766 --> 00:58:41.026]  I'm not going to do anything, you know.
[00:58:41.086 --> 00:58:43.648]  And sure enough, they came and got him.
[00:58:44.168 --> 00:58:44.569]  That's right.
[00:58:44.589 --> 00:58:45.329]  Great job, Adon.
[00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:46.790]  Your story is so important.
[00:58:46.830 --> 00:58:47.991]  Everybody should get it out.
[00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:49.352]  They've been trying to suppress it.
[00:58:49.432 --> 00:58:50.132]  Get it out, folks.
[00:58:50.352 --> 00:58:51.133]  Infowars.com.
[00:58:52.691 --> 00:58:54.114]  Well, that's it for our show tonight.
