[00:00:04.574 --> 00:00:17.868]  Intruder alert!
[00:00:17.868 --> 00:00:21.832]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:21.832 --> 00:00:27.698]  These people are coming for everybody!
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.089]  I purposely today did not wear a sports jacket and dress shirt.
[00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:43.102]  I purposely today did about one-tenth the prep I normally do for the broadcast.
[00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:58.152]  And that's because I don't normally actually come in here and purpose to do anything but stream of consciousness and to tell the truth and to have our guest on and look at what's happening in the world.
[00:00:58.152 --> 00:01:13.462]  But I tend to sit here at home and when I get into the office for hours, poring over news clips, video clips, articles, guest information, and kind of get lost in just trying to categorize it all and then cover it.
[00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.791]  Every day in the broadcast, and 60-70% of what I wanted to cover I didn't get to.
[00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:21.733]  A lot of it was most important information.
[00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:34.800]  And it's almost like trying to gather it all together, and then order it in my mind, is the reason I'm actually not getting to a lot of it on air, I kind of realize.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.404]  I was sitting back this morning, reading a Paul Watson article on InfoWars.com,
[00:01:42.205 --> 00:01:55.911]  Where the State Department spokesman comes out and basically threatens Russia and says, if you don't get out of Syria, you're going to have terror attacks in your own country.
[00:01:55.911 --> 00:01:58.913]  Now, you have to understand, the West did create these groups.
[00:01:58.913 --> 00:02:00.854]  They did give them a safe haven.
[00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:03.335]  And Paul Watson rightly says it's a threat to Russia.
[00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:04.716]  In fact, he did that in his article.
[00:02:04.716 --> 00:02:06.116]  We can go back three years ago.
[00:02:06.116 --> 00:02:09.298]  The ambassador to the UN, Bandar Bush,
[00:02:10.913 --> 00:02:31.398]  That's his nickname, Prince Sultan Bandar, threatened at the UN, the Russian Foreign Minister, Lavrov, and this was on Russian TV, but it also came out in Saudi Arabian News, and said, we're going to attack you with our Jihad armies that are encircling you if you don't back off.
[00:02:31.398 --> 00:02:36.259]  Saudi's threatened Russia with Olympic Terrace attacks unless it abandons Syrian support.
[00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.439]  That's 2013.
[00:02:39.093 --> 00:02:42.474]  You can actually go watch the reports about it.
[00:02:42.474 --> 00:02:47.877]  So that's an Infowars.com story, but it links through to RT and other TV breakdowns of it.
[00:02:47.877 --> 00:02:49.057]  So this is just more of the same.
[00:02:49.057 --> 00:02:52.138]  You're seeing the recklessness.
[00:02:52.138 --> 00:03:00.782]  I mean, this is so reckless and so dangerous that it's surreal.
[00:03:00.782 --> 00:03:03.043]  And then it gets even more surreal.
[00:03:03.043 --> 00:03:08.765]  I was sitting there this morning looking out over the Texas Hill Country.
[00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:18.931]  And I was thinking about history and what's happened in human culture, and I was thinking, why am I so concerned?
[00:03:18.931 --> 00:03:20.993]  And I said, it's clear these people are megalomaniacs.
[00:03:20.993 --> 00:03:24.476]  They're insane.
[00:03:24.476 --> 00:03:26.197]  And they haven't learned from history.
[00:03:26.197 --> 00:03:38.568]  And then I was thinking, why am I so troubled by them going on MSNBC and CNN and putting my picture up there with Putin's, with Trump's, and saying that we're, quote, Russian agents and we get our orders from Putin and he's our godfather.
[00:03:40.657 --> 00:03:42.037]  Because I was thinking, it's ridiculous.
[00:03:42.037 --> 00:03:43.378]  It's made up.
[00:03:43.378 --> 00:03:44.618]  It's not true.
[00:03:44.618 --> 00:03:49.440]  That's just another sovereign nation trying to get out from under globalism, just like the Brexit.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.321]  They don't say we're British agents because we're modeling what we're doing after the Brexit.
[00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:55.102]  They're modeling what they did off of 1776.
[00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:56.883]  Nigel Farage has said that.
[00:03:56.883 --> 00:04:02.525]  We're imitating common sense, you know, like the French kicking the Nazis out at the end of World War II with the help of the U.S.
[00:04:02.525 --> 00:04:03.025]  and the Allies.
[00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.290]  And then it clicked.
[00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.452]  I mean, I already knew this, but it clicked.
[00:04:09.452 --> 00:04:13.013]  It's like, oh my gosh, they really are going to have a war with Russia.
[00:04:13.013 --> 00:04:16.195]  And anyone that doesn't go along with the war is a Russian agent.
[00:04:16.195 --> 00:04:22.578]  Because none of this makes sense, and it's comical, unless you know you're going for broke, and you don't care.
[00:04:22.578 --> 00:04:25.340]  And that's why the elite are all buying bunkers and leaving the United States.
[00:04:28.632 --> 00:04:32.073]  And it may not be this year or next year, but it's what Joel Skousen talks about.
[00:04:32.073 --> 00:04:41.216]  World War III with the Russians is set in the next four to five years, and the globalists want to entice the Russians to attack in a first strike.
[00:04:41.216 --> 00:04:42.517]  Oh, man.
[00:04:42.517 --> 00:04:44.797]  I mean, I'm sure of it.
[00:04:44.797 --> 00:04:50.559]  It hit me like that train that went off the tracks in Yonkers, killing three people and injuring over 100.
[00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:52.940]  I mean, it was like, boom!
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.581]  That's why they're going to start a war with Russia.
[00:04:56.661 --> 00:05:00.990]  And then if you don't want to have a war, and all the gun confiscation that comes with it, they're gonna arrest you.
[00:05:02.814 --> 00:05:08.497]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com, and this is an email from Family Gino.
[00:05:08.497 --> 00:05:15.179]  I took down my rebel flag, which you can't buy on eBay anymore, and peeled the NRA sticker off my rear car window.
[00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:19.841]  I disconnected my home alarm system and quit the candy-ass neighborhood watch.
[00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:24.023]  I bought two Pakistani flags and put one at each corner of the front yard.
[00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:29.366]  Then I purchased the black flag of ISIS, which you can buy on eBay, and ran it up the flagpole.
[00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:30.326]  Now the local police
[00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:37.432]  Sheriff, FBI, CIA, NSA, Homeland Security, and other agencies are all watching my house 24-7.
[00:05:37.432 --> 00:05:43.317]  I've never felt safer, and I'm saving $69.95 a month that ADT used to charge me.
[00:05:43.317 --> 00:05:46.940]  Plus, I bought burkas for my wife and I to wear when we shop or travel.
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.843]  Everyone moves out of the way and security can't pat us down?
[00:05:49.843 --> 00:05:53.706]  If they say I'm a male wearing a burka, I just say, I'm feeling like a woman today.
[00:05:53.706 --> 00:05:54.447]  Hot damn!
[00:05:54.447 --> 00:05:55.368]  Safe at last!
[00:05:55.368 --> 00:05:56.329]  Ain't America great?
[00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:59.971]  You can find more reports like this at Infowars.com.
[00:05:59.971 --> 00:06:00.931]  This is Joe Biggs.
[00:06:20.262 --> 00:06:22.163]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[00:06:22.163 --> 00:06:23.984]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:25.044]  I popped two of them.
[00:06:25.044 --> 00:06:27.325]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[00:06:27.325 --> 00:06:29.126]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[00:06:29.126 --> 00:06:30.786]  It's got four and a half stars.
[00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:32.107]  People really love it.
[00:06:32.107 --> 00:06:32.707]  Read about it.
[00:06:32.707 --> 00:06:36.549]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:41.831]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[00:06:42.011 --> 00:06:46.054]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[00:06:46.054 --> 00:06:52.199]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:58.104]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:06.584]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:07:06.584 --> 00:07:12.889]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:20.174]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:07:20.174 --> 00:07:28.981]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:07:29.281 --> 00:07:35.464]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:07:35.464 --> 00:07:40.286]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:07:40.286 --> 00:07:43.868]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:07:43.868 --> 00:07:45.769]  No needles, no injections.
[00:07:45.769 --> 00:07:47.430]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.611]  Try it for yourself.
[00:07:48.611 --> 00:07:50.932]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[00:07:56.715 --> 00:07:57.735]  InfoWarsLife Secret 12.
[00:07:57.735 --> 00:07:58.956]  It's September 29th, 2016.
[00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:07.622]  Only 39 short days until the historic 2016 November election.
[00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:34.850]  We're so close, you can almost touch it.
[00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.271]  Americanism versus globalism.
[00:08:38.271 --> 00:08:42.051]  The New World Order corporate combine has hijacked our nation.
[00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:46.012]  Wants to tell us that sovereignty is racist and evil.
[00:08:46.012 --> 00:08:51.133]  And that if we go the way of the Brigs in the UK, we're somehow Russian agents.
[00:08:51.133 --> 00:08:54.854]  The truth is, Russia has nothing to do with this election.
[00:08:54.854 --> 00:08:59.135]  Other than the fact that Russia has already partially pulled away from the New World Order.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:14.444]  It's now time for us to proudly join the UK and Russia in re-establishing national sovereignty and our constitutional republics.
[00:09:14.444 --> 00:09:26.329]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, broadcasting from Austin, Texas, worldwide.
[00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:31.332]  Just 39 days, ladies and gentlemen, 39 days.
[00:09:31.332 --> 00:09:32.052]  I purposely
[00:09:33.775 --> 00:09:37.317]  Did not wear a sports jacket, did not wear a dress shirt today.
[00:09:37.317 --> 00:09:44.482]  I purposely only did about two hours of prep.
[00:09:44.482 --> 00:09:47.144]  Normally I would do four hours of prep.
[00:09:47.144 --> 00:09:52.707]  And I realized, I've known this for a while, but I've really psychoanalyzed it for myself.
[00:09:52.707 --> 00:09:58.571]  I remember my grandfathers listening to the radio
[00:10:00.836 --> 00:10:13.580]  And hearing some stock news or some farming news or some oil news and getting excited or going, you know, cussing under their breath occasionally or reading the newspaper, my mom's dad especially, and just face turning red sometimes.
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.361]  Does he really care?
[00:10:14.361 --> 00:10:19.803]  God, I miss all those folks that are dead.
[00:10:19.803 --> 00:10:20.863]  Great people.
[00:10:20.863 --> 00:10:21.983]  You don't see people like that anymore.
[00:10:21.983 --> 00:10:24.484]  It's scary.
[00:10:24.484 --> 00:10:26.105]  And I was just thinking about it this morning.
[00:10:26.105 --> 00:10:28.386]  I was like, wow!
[00:10:28.386 --> 00:10:29.046]  I get in here
[00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:32.832]  And I research all this news.
[00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:38.454]  I study it in the evening, at night.
[00:10:38.454 --> 00:10:39.794]  I work on Saturday and Sunday.
[00:10:39.794 --> 00:10:41.515]  I'm not complaining.
[00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:55.781]  Wild horses couldn't drag me away, but no wonder after I watch 20, 30 video clips and look at over 100 news articles conservatively, I get on air and it's like, how do I tell people how real this is?
[00:10:55.781 --> 00:11:00.403]  I have trouble believing how open this is, where yesterday,
[00:11:01.522 --> 00:11:03.804]  I probably got to only five of them.
[00:11:03.804 --> 00:11:20.475]  There was more than 20 articles from mainstream media promoting the United Nations running America's elections, our police, everything.
[00:11:20.475 --> 00:11:21.376]  It's really happening.
[00:11:24.158 --> 00:11:33.521]  And then I sit there and I watch State Department clips where they say, we'll basically turn jihadis loose in Russia to attack Russian targets inside Russia if you don't pull out.
[00:11:33.521 --> 00:11:36.342]  We have that clip coming up.
[00:11:36.342 --> 00:11:49.786]  And then I remember three years ago, the UN ambassador from Saudi Arabia, Prince Sultan Bandar, threatening the Russians with jihadi attacks if they didn't back out of Syria.
[00:11:51.618 --> 00:11:55.880]  And I know that the globalists and NATO and Hillary and Obama created ISIS.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.721]  That's admitted.
[00:11:56.721 --> 00:11:59.162]  The Pentagon knows that.
[00:11:59.162 --> 00:12:00.342]  General Flynn knows that.
[00:12:00.342 --> 00:12:04.364]  That's really the guy in there that's the quarterback with Trump.
[00:12:04.364 --> 00:12:06.105]  Trump's the head coach.
[00:12:06.105 --> 00:12:08.086]  Let me tell you, the quarterback's Flynn.
[00:12:08.086 --> 00:12:09.527]  Flynn's running the show.
[00:12:13.097 --> 00:12:15.417]  In fact, the word is Flynn didn't even want the VP position.
[00:12:15.417 --> 00:12:16.798]  He said, no, I don't want that.
[00:12:16.798 --> 00:12:21.679]  I want to be able to totally focus on not just giving proxy speeches, but actually getting stuff lined up.
[00:12:21.679 --> 00:12:41.263]  In fact, I didn't play all of Flynn a few weeks ago whenever Trump chomped the mainstream media and said he was going to respond to the birther controversy and spent 30 seconds on it at the end of a 45 minute rally with a bunch of congressional medal honor winners and generals and former admirals and people endorsing him.
[00:12:42.003 --> 00:12:53.392]  We ought to queue that up today and play General Flynn, almost coming to tears, talking about 1775, Lexington and Concord, this is it, America's been captured, we have to take it back.
[00:12:53.392 --> 00:12:55.273]  That's what's happened, folks.
[00:12:55.273 --> 00:12:59.957]  And the news won't carry Trump's speeches when he says, Hillary Clinton is a Chinese agent.
[00:12:59.957 --> 00:13:01.918]  She is.
[00:13:01.918 --> 00:13:03.139]  This isn't rhetoric.
[00:13:03.139 --> 00:13:09.924]  So no wonder they call Trump a Russian agent, no wonder they call me a Russian agent, and
[00:13:11.581 --> 00:13:15.783]  Put our faces up there with Vladimir Putin on CNN and MSNBC and you name it.
[00:13:15.783 --> 00:13:17.384]  Because these are globalists.
[00:13:17.384 --> 00:13:19.385]  These are people that hijacked our country.
[00:13:19.385 --> 00:13:20.446]  They are the outsiders.
[00:13:20.446 --> 00:13:34.133]  And as I've said a thousand times, once you identify that an outside global force has hijacked you with 21st century high-tech algorithms that have taken over the stock markets, the interest rates, the currency rates, the economy, that's all admitted.
[00:13:34.133 --> 00:13:40.917]  And you understand that there's five megabanks that control basically almost everything now, and they want to mop up what's left of wealth to control you.
[00:13:42.526 --> 00:13:56.130]  And you identify that the New World Order is a worldwide corporate tyranny, and the former head of the NSA, technical leader, the guy that actually ran the NSA, that was number two at the NSA, comes on and I say, what is the master plan?
[00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.090]  He goes, a global corporate government.
[00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:01.971]  It is a technocracy, a total takeover.
[00:14:01.971 --> 00:14:07.513]  The NSA isn't joining with other companies for America, the NSA is forming a global grid.
[00:14:11.653 --> 00:14:13.556]  And this is the death of this country, people.
[00:14:13.556 --> 00:14:19.523]  You're watching it, okay?
[00:14:19.523 --> 00:14:22.687]  This is an admitted program.
[00:14:22.687 --> 00:14:24.169]  And they admit it.
[00:14:24.169 --> 00:14:25.510]  But they've done it.
[00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.151]  To a great extent.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:33.825]  And that's why the State Department's so arrogant, and that's why the Saudis are so arrogant, and that's why the Communist Chinese are so arrogant.
[00:14:33.825 --> 00:14:53.079]  Almost every movie I go see now that has to do with technology or science fiction or action-adventure, the Communist Chinese are in it at the Politburo advising America with red flags flying, with hammers and sickles, and pictures of Mao, and then they tell NASA, they tell the Army, they tell the superheroes what to do, they tell the Avengers what to do,
[00:14:55.083 --> 00:14:59.847]  They tell, you know, what type of booster to save Matt Damon when he's stuck on Mars.
[00:14:59.847 --> 00:15:10.996]  I mean, again, when you go see almost every movie, and it's Chinese communist propaganda, you're like, what in the world is going on?
[00:15:10.996 --> 00:15:18.683]  I mean, that alone, everybody should just go, whoa, and the hair on the back of their neck.
[00:15:18.683 --> 00:15:20.805]  The first few times I started seeing it, remember they,
[00:15:21.564 --> 00:15:26.088]  Didn't release Red Dawn for over a year because it had the communist Chinese attacking?
[00:15:26.088 --> 00:15:28.510]  So they changed it to North Korea?
[00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:32.953]  And they had to reshoot and re-edit a bunch of the movie?
[00:15:32.953 --> 00:15:34.174]  That's how controlled we are!
[00:15:34.174 --> 00:15:35.575]  That's who's running our country!
[00:15:35.575 --> 00:15:38.978]  Do the Russians control what goes on our movies?
[00:15:38.978 --> 00:15:41.520]  Do the British for that matter?
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.623]  No, it's global government.
[00:15:44.623 --> 00:15:47.325]  Iceland has pulled out of it.
[00:15:47.325 --> 00:15:48.986]  The UK is trying to pull out.
[00:15:48.986 --> 00:15:50.287]  Russia is trying to pull out.
[00:15:50.287 --> 00:15:51.248]  We're trying to pull out.
[00:15:55.066 --> 00:16:03.436]  And a lot of people, like Dr. Paul Greg Roberts, who's a smart guy, but, you know, he just, he doesn't get one level of this three-dimensional chess game.
[00:16:03.436 --> 00:16:05.278]  And I say this because it's a fact.
[00:16:05.278 --> 00:16:06.860]  I've been proved right.
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.162]  The emails are all public.
[00:16:08.162 --> 00:16:09.103]  You know, the data leaks.
[00:16:09.103 --> 00:16:10.124]  It's everything I said.
[00:16:10.124 --> 00:16:12.226]  World government.
[00:16:12.226 --> 00:16:14.009]  George Soros trying to cause race wars.
[00:16:14.009 --> 00:16:14.950]  He symbolized the country.
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.442]  And criminal elites here in the U.S.
[00:16:19.442 --> 00:16:21.283]  transferring power to the U.N.
[00:16:21.283 --> 00:16:25.066]  Because Roberts goes, it's the United States and the neocons, it's not the U.N.
[00:16:25.066 --> 00:16:25.947]  I know that.
[00:16:25.947 --> 00:16:31.511]  It's criminals here transferring the power into a diplomatically immune combine.
[00:16:31.511 --> 00:16:31.971]  The U.N.'
[00:16:31.951 --> 00:16:33.352]  's only the head of it.
[00:16:33.352 --> 00:16:41.739]  The OECD, the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO, the TPP agreement, they're transferring it to this system above us.
[00:16:42.875 --> 00:16:44.977]  But he gets caught and goes, but it's America.
[00:16:44.977 --> 00:16:52.083]  Yes, it's criminals that use our energy, our weapons, our culture to empower the machine.
[00:16:52.083 --> 00:16:55.246]  But we're being melted down to form the new system.
[00:16:57.594 --> 00:16:58.315]  It's a fact.
[00:16:58.315 --> 00:17:01.977]  The UN with Justice Department power is coming in to run our police departments.
[00:17:01.977 --> 00:17:02.617]  It's a fact.
[00:17:02.617 --> 00:17:05.900]  They're running a call for reparations for, quote, black people.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:11.583]  It's a fact that they're suing Arpaio and getting ready to sue the Texas government for even having any border control.
[00:17:11.583 --> 00:17:15.686]  It's a fact they're running the refugees coming into Europe and coming into the United States.
[00:17:15.686 --> 00:17:18.088]  It's a fact they're running global carbon taxes.
[00:17:18.088 --> 00:17:21.410]  It's a fact.
[00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.951]  But people get lost in it because
[00:17:25.729 --> 00:17:27.050]  Always!
[00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:30.413]  It was supposed to be America running the UN, America running the global government.
[00:17:30.413 --> 00:17:31.174]  That was the whole plan.
[00:17:31.174 --> 00:17:36.178]  That's why, after World War II, the United States funded the whole thing with the Rockefellers.
[00:17:36.178 --> 00:17:45.025]  And it was supposed to be America is going to project Americanism and free market into the world with this global corporate government by giving technology to third world countries to build them up.
[00:17:45.025 --> 00:17:46.526]  But it was all double-crossed.
[00:17:46.526 --> 00:17:48.588]  And by 49, the decision was made.
[00:17:48.588 --> 00:17:49.689]  It's in the Royal Commission.
[00:17:49.689 --> 00:17:51.350]  1949, look it up.
[00:17:53.541 --> 00:17:55.722]  Queen Elizabeth's father's name is on the letterhead.
[00:17:55.722 --> 00:17:59.242]  And they said, we're not going to industrialize the third world.
[00:17:59.242 --> 00:18:14.166]  We're going to exploit it, have reservations of high-tech, give them nothing, let their populations explode, and then exploit them further, and then use them in reverse colonization within the next 60 years to overtake our Western competitors.
[00:18:14.166 --> 00:18:16.387]  It's cold-blooded people.
[00:18:16.387 --> 00:18:17.667]  They got a plan.
[00:18:17.667 --> 00:18:20.108]  And they mean business.
[00:18:20.108 --> 00:18:21.028]  And you've got corrupt
[00:18:22.512 --> 00:18:28.414]  Strongman, gangster-style Russia.
[00:18:28.414 --> 00:18:34.857]  Stumbling around, trying to get reorganized, that barely pulled away from the robber barons.
[00:18:34.857 --> 00:18:41.819]  And the West is trying to destroy that, while it's trying to destroy itself.
[00:18:41.819 --> 00:18:48.622]  And the Brits learn, hey, 90% of your laws, or more, are made by the European Union, and you never got to vote to enter it.
[00:18:49.673 --> 00:18:52.294]  So the Brits vote to go, yeah, we should be able to make our own laws.
[00:18:52.294 --> 00:18:54.095]  We want out of this.
[00:18:54.095 --> 00:18:55.595]  We don't want open borders.
[00:18:55.595 --> 00:18:56.756]  We don't want all these huge taxes.
[00:18:56.756 --> 00:18:59.757]  We don't want to be like France or Germany.
[00:18:59.757 --> 00:19:04.699]  And I told you before it happened, I said, this mayor is going to ignore all this, this Muslim mayor.
[00:19:04.699 --> 00:19:09.480]  And it's going to say, I'm going to issue visas within the city I control.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.601]  And of course, he's now announced that.
[00:19:10.601 --> 00:19:11.521]  And how did I know he'd do that?
[00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:13.642]  Because it's a battle plan.
[00:19:13.642 --> 00:19:16.683]  Arnold, I'm going to skip this break, Schwarzenegger.
[00:19:20.782 --> 00:19:30.305]  Was hired six years ago when the Copenhagen Treaty fell through for carbon taxes globally because it raped the third world.
[00:19:30.305 --> 00:19:32.066]  It was sold as a way to empower the third world.
[00:19:32.066 --> 00:19:34.667]  Oh, liberal, loving, a liberal world order.
[00:19:34.667 --> 00:19:36.868]  It was a nightmare system of eugenics and control.
[00:19:36.868 --> 00:19:40.809]  Would kill a billion people over a decade, most experts agreed.
[00:19:40.809 --> 00:19:41.709]  Horrible.
[00:19:41.709 --> 00:19:42.950]  How about turning the global economy off?
[00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:43.390]  This would do it.
[00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:47.271]  And then make who was surviving in third world's flood even harder.
[00:19:47.271 --> 00:19:48.952]  Again, the big refugee crisis they've been planning.
[00:19:50.245 --> 00:20:16.010]  And Schwarzenegger was dispatched to organize programs to get mayors elected with UN and IMF and World Bank and Soros money in every major industrialized country to then create their own sanctuary cities and to quote work with the UN and become partners with it to circumvent national sovereignty and Schwarzenegger gave press conferences and was in the news saying we're going to circumvent Congress
[00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:22.815]  We're going to circumvent this and we're going to implement this because the Earth needs to be safe.
[00:20:22.815 --> 00:20:24.036]  It's heating up!
[00:20:24.036 --> 00:20:26.477]  It is heating up!
[00:20:26.477 --> 00:20:36.041]  This is a pig with, admittedly, thousands of automatic weapons, four or five army tanks, helicopters with rocket launchers on them, because he's an elitist, he can have it.
[00:20:36.041 --> 00:20:40.302]  He wants to ban semi-auto.
[00:20:40.302 --> 00:20:45.565]  But it's okay because he's a Republican and Republicans feel good because, oh, he's in our team or whatever.
[00:20:45.565 --> 00:20:46.145]  Pure bull.
[00:20:48.652 --> 00:20:50.434]  So I knew what Khan would do.
[00:20:50.434 --> 00:20:51.436]  I looked at who funded him.
[00:20:51.436 --> 00:20:52.076]  I knew.
[00:20:52.076 --> 00:20:53.518]  I know the exact battle plan.
[00:20:53.518 --> 00:20:54.459]  I know their playbook.
[00:20:54.459 --> 00:20:56.462]  And by the way, I'm not bragging.
[00:20:56.462 --> 00:21:02.650]  How stupid are our governors and others that think they know what's going on and are only partly fighting this when this is, you know, it's like...
[00:21:04.036 --> 00:21:13.959]  I mean, I get called sometimes by former governors, current governors, and they're like, Alex, I don't want to come on the air, but I want you to know we listen all the time, but you're just, you're the tip of the spear, and thanks for making it safe for us to talk, but wow, you're being proven right.
[00:21:13.959 --> 00:21:15.279]  This is really happening.
[00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:18.480]  And I'm like, this is much worse than I'm even saying, okay?
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.360]  This is cut and dry.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.102]  You must address it for how bad it is, and how serious it is, because that's what it is.
[00:21:25.327 --> 00:21:46.860]  If an asteroid was coming, and it was 2 million miles out, and it was going to get here in a couple months, and it was the size of Rhode Island, and was going to kill all the life on Earth and create a new ice age, we need to get ships on the gantry, on the launch pad, we need to launch everything we've got with weapons, and go out there and nuke the damn thing.
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:47.481]  Or die trying.
[00:21:48.837 --> 00:21:50.837]  Oh, that's fear-mongering to say a giant asteroid's coming.
[00:21:50.837 --> 00:21:53.198]  Again, this is figurative for the New York Times and others.
[00:21:53.198 --> 00:21:56.838]  You'll still deceive your people and still let somebody see and cut me out saying a giant asteroid's coming.
[00:21:56.838 --> 00:21:58.099]  It's an analogy.
[00:21:58.099 --> 00:21:59.319]  It's an allegory.
[00:21:59.319 --> 00:22:00.319]  It's a parable.
[00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:01.159]  It's an example.
[00:22:01.159 --> 00:22:02.639]  It's a case point.
[00:22:02.639 --> 00:22:06.060]  You've got this 25-mile-wide asteroid coming, okay?
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.280]  It's a couple million miles away.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.180]  It's going to be here in a few months.
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:13.181]  We could mobilize and stop it, but you've got to admit the damn thing's coming.
[00:22:13.181 --> 00:22:18.062]  You've got to admit it's going to t-bone right in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with the computer models.
[00:22:19.155 --> 00:22:20.376]  They know when it's gonna hit!
[00:22:20.376 --> 00:22:22.537]  They know the minute it's coming into the atmosphere!
[00:22:22.537 --> 00:22:26.680]  We gotta stop it!
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:44.312]  We are faced with a technological takeover, stealing our ingenuity, stealing our ideas, sequestering it, building a breakaway civilization, that's mopping up Africa, mopping up Latin America, mopping up Asia, mopping up Russia, mopping up the Middle East, with destabilization,
[00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:46.932]  Mopping up our families.
[00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:48.613]  Mopping up our farms.
[00:22:48.613 --> 00:22:52.737]  Mopping up the Amish.
[00:22:52.737 --> 00:22:53.398]  Ending everything!
[00:22:55.475 --> 00:23:01.736]  And they write books, and they brag, and they say, the future doesn't need you, it's gonna be great, we're gonna phase you out, it's gonna be a utopia, you're done.
[00:23:01.736 --> 00:23:13.979]  And they just walk by like we don't even exist, and then they have these stay-behind networks, these rearguard actions as they build their breakaway civilization over here on the launchpad right in front of us, a hundred times the Manhattan Project in their own words.
[00:23:13.979 --> 00:23:17.760]  I'm here going, uh, uh, uh, they're so arrogant they admit this, we gotta do something.
[00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:25.752]  And the average man is telling me about fantasy football, and the average woman, you know, is getting their eyelashes done.
[00:23:25.752 --> 00:23:27.433]  Fine, I mean, I get it, whatever.
[00:23:27.433 --> 00:23:31.635]  It's going on about your life.
[00:23:31.635 --> 00:23:44.381]  And I'm sitting here, watching these idiots in mainstream media, who are going along with the destruction of the planet and their own species, thinking they're on a winning team, reading off teleprompters.
[00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:46.802]  When their kids are eating GMO, they're breathing the poison air.
[00:23:51.132 --> 00:23:52.953]  Everywhere I turn, people are getting Parkinson's.
[00:23:52.953 --> 00:23:54.254]  Young people.
[00:23:54.254 --> 00:23:55.535]  Neurological disorders.
[00:23:55.535 --> 00:23:57.616]  We are being murdered.
[00:23:57.616 --> 00:24:08.282]  The globalists are on such a demonic power trip that they believe they're going to have this super technology soon, with the singularities, they can just do whatever they want, clean up the earth in a flash, whatever, where they don't even care if reactors leak or melt down now.
[00:24:08.282 --> 00:24:12.144]  They admit they just have, you know, Mombiot and the Guardian going, I love radiation, it's good, ooh!
[00:24:12.144 --> 00:24:15.926]  You know, it's like, let them eat cake, slit your wrists, dance around like a psychopath.
[00:24:19.662 --> 00:24:22.746]  The people that are running this are under a delusion.
[00:24:22.746 --> 00:24:24.969]  They think they know what's going on.
[00:24:24.969 --> 00:24:28.494]  They do not know what's going on.
[00:24:28.494 --> 00:24:32.599]  And I will assure them, you are not going to get this promised land you've been offered.
[00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.551]  See, Donald Trump just wants to continue with what we got.
[00:24:38.551 --> 00:24:44.013]  Helicopters, jets, hotels, golf courses, beautiful women, his kids, hamburgers.
[00:24:44.013 --> 00:24:44.994]  He wants to be dominant.
[00:24:44.994 --> 00:24:47.915]  He wants to, you know, but that's not fair China screwing us.
[00:24:47.915 --> 00:24:51.156]  I'll make a better deal and I'll be a big hero and that's great.
[00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:53.377]  You know, they just know he's a throwback.
[00:24:53.377 --> 00:24:57.098]  Just an old-fashioned guy that wants to have prosperity.
[00:24:57.098 --> 00:24:58.419]  You know, he's an authoritarian.
[00:24:58.419 --> 00:25:00.700]  He wants to crack heads of enemies and stuff.
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.921]  That's why they cannot stand him because they've got something
[00:25:04.033 --> 00:25:06.914]  A hundred times more twisted, more sophisticated.
[00:25:06.914 --> 00:25:17.937]  You know, they look at just strong men in Russia and strong men in America and just guys that want to have a big prosperous country and have the people love them and want to build something and you know.
[00:25:17.937 --> 00:25:21.158]  Let me tell you what will explain everything to you.
[00:25:21.158 --> 00:25:21.978]  My grandmother
[00:25:25.905 --> 00:25:27.145]  We're good to go.
[00:25:44.602 --> 00:25:54.610]  And because there's photos of her, you know, young and beautiful getting on the bullet train that looks like one of those trains from the old Superman movies, those old Superman TV shows, you know, faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive!
[00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:57.432]  You know, those big, fast bullet trains, big black trains.
[00:25:57.432 --> 00:26:05.318]  And that thing would go 120, 130 miles an hour for the 100 miles down to Houston, and she'd get down there in less than an hour and come right back.
[00:26:05.318 --> 00:26:10.842]  It was an express.
[00:26:10.842 --> 00:26:12.683]  And today,
[00:26:13.979 --> 00:26:20.541]  Trains on that very line don't go above 40 miles an hour because the beds never got fixed, so it'll shake.
[00:26:20.541 --> 00:26:25.283]  So in 2016, the freight trains can't go more than 45 miles an hour.
[00:26:25.283 --> 00:26:32.665]  And that's why you see, you know, people fall asleep at the switches or things malfunctioning or trains flying off the rail beds because our infrastructure is falling apart, people.
[00:26:32.665 --> 00:26:36.687]  They have 300 mile an hour trains in Tokyo.
[00:26:36.687 --> 00:26:40.248]  They have 280 mile an hour trains in France.
[00:26:40.248 --> 00:26:43.109]  We have 45 mile an hour trains.
[00:26:43.109 --> 00:26:43.349]  You see,
[00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:52.957]  You know, in the early 1950s, that was the end of innovation where they, you know, by 1900 had bullet trains going 100 miles an hour.
[00:26:52.957 --> 00:27:02.726]  They had trains going 160 miles an hour by the time the decision was made to scrap the railroads in the late 1950s.
[00:27:02.726 --> 00:27:04.948]  See, it wasn't about innovation anymore.
[00:27:04.948 --> 00:27:07.110]  It wasn't about building something for the people.
[00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.552]  It was about taking all your resources, hoarding it,
[00:27:11.698 --> 00:27:19.002]  So the elites can talk about Mars bases and all this other stuff, and then we get nothing down here.
[00:27:19.002 --> 00:27:20.683]  The allegory is Elysium.
[00:27:20.683 --> 00:27:28.927]  They're breaking away, not making this the golden fields, but creating their own golden fields, shucked off of us.
[00:27:28.927 --> 00:27:31.908]  The ultimate form of siege against the people.
[00:27:31.908 --> 00:27:36.491]  And then I've got a report coming up that Eric Green did about how they said there were no tax penalties in the bill.
[00:27:37.659 --> 00:27:39.481]  And no penalties on Obamacare.
[00:27:39.481 --> 00:27:53.255]  And then now, of course, started three years ago, the first numbers came in, 1.8 billion dollars in fines of millions of Americans.
[00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:57.359]  And the Washington Times says the media wrongly attacked Brudge.
[00:27:57.359 --> 00:28:01.503]  No, they didn't have hundreds of newspapers wrongly attack Brudge and Infowars and others.
[00:28:03.626 --> 00:28:12.229]  They didn't wrongly, they knew it was in the bill, they just lied to people to go ahead and get the thing implemented to rape them!
[00:28:12.229 --> 00:28:15.831]  It's not like they're accidentally doing this.
[00:28:15.831 --> 00:28:19.312]  They want to flaunt the FBI director in front of you with Hillary above the law.
[00:28:19.312 --> 00:28:23.874]  They want to have on Charlie Rose at the State Department.
[00:28:24.813 --> 00:28:29.235]  And on C-SPAN, all these different government bureaucrats go, man, the public's dumb.
[00:28:29.235 --> 00:28:30.735]  We sure are screwing them.
[00:28:30.735 --> 00:28:32.996]  Ha ha ha.
[00:28:32.996 --> 00:28:33.756]  And just laughing.
[00:28:33.756 --> 00:28:35.417]  I'm going to put a compilation of laughing.
[00:28:35.417 --> 00:28:38.298]  It's always the same demonic laugh of victory.
[00:28:38.298 --> 00:28:40.799]  Of just, of just, they are our slaves.
[00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:42.359]  They are under our servitude.
[00:28:42.359 --> 00:28:43.600]  We have won.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.081]  And these people all look like demons when they're doing it.
[00:28:52.042 --> 00:29:00.144]  They all do the same.
[00:29:00.144 --> 00:29:02.804]  It's like, wow, man, these are bad people.
[00:29:02.804 --> 00:29:03.805]  They're not like us.
[00:29:03.805 --> 00:29:06.325]  Okay.
[00:29:06.325 --> 00:29:09.986]  And that's what I'm getting at here.
[00:29:09.986 --> 00:29:13.767]  If I'm in a restaurant and I see a poor family with a kid who's paralyzed,
[00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:18.712]  And the child seems so loving and the parents are trying to feed it.
[00:29:18.712 --> 00:29:21.994]  It's like 18 years old.
[00:29:21.994 --> 00:29:32.161]  The child, I sit there and I feel pain and I want to help those people and I feel empathy and psychopaths would call me weak.
[00:29:32.161 --> 00:29:32.922]  No, I'm not weak.
[00:29:32.922 --> 00:29:34.082]  I'm strong.
[00:29:34.082 --> 00:29:35.003]  That's why I feel all this.
[00:29:35.003 --> 00:29:35.884]  I open myself up to it.
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.941]  You people are the opposite.
[00:29:37.941 --> 00:29:41.825]  You decided to not care, so now you love it.
[00:29:41.825 --> 00:29:44.328]  You love the honeybees dying.
[00:29:44.328 --> 00:29:45.169]  You love it.
[00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.809]  You love it.
[00:29:45.809 --> 00:29:46.290]  You love it.
[00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:47.591]  You love the death of the earth.
[00:29:47.591 --> 00:29:48.773]  You celebrate.
[00:29:48.773 --> 00:29:49.313]  You love it.
[00:29:49.313 --> 00:29:50.434]  You want World War III.
[00:29:50.434 --> 00:29:51.716]  You love death.
[00:29:51.716 --> 00:29:53.117]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.117 --> 00:29:55.640]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.323]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.475 --> 00:30:06.119]  Let's face it, most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones.
[00:30:06.119 --> 00:30:10.904]  But recent studies link cell phone use to major health issues, including brain cancer.
[00:30:10.904 --> 00:30:14.668]  Experts say parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful.
[00:30:14.668 --> 00:30:18.793]  Doctors say the infant brain, even while in the womb, is especially vulnerable.
[00:30:18.933 --> 00:30:23.237]  So keep the phone away from your abdomen, especially toward the end of pregnancy.
[00:30:23.237 --> 00:30:28.763]  And for men, using a cell phone for as little as an hour a day is literally cooking your sperm.
[00:30:28.763 --> 00:30:33.387]  Lowering sperm count levels so much that conceiving a child could be difficult.
[00:30:33.387 --> 00:30:35.630]  This is one of those times you want to keep it out of your pants.
[00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:41.473]  And for those of us who use our cell phones before bed, know that the screen light is actually disrupting your sleep rhythms.
[00:30:41.473 --> 00:30:44.135]  This causes insomnia and slows the metabolism.
[00:30:44.135 --> 00:30:45.415]  Hello, weight gain!
[00:30:45.415 --> 00:30:50.518]  Generally speaking, when cell phones are on, they're constantly emitting radio frequency radiation.
[00:30:50.518 --> 00:30:52.780]  So keep your phone in airplane mode when you can.
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.381]  Keep the phone at least two feet away from your body.
[00:30:55.381 --> 00:30:56.322]  Use headphones.
[00:30:56.322 --> 00:30:59.644]  And when you're not on your phone, keep it as far away from you as possible.
[00:30:59.644 --> 00:31:01.685]  Leigh Ann McAdoo with your InfoWars Tip of the Week.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.501]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:31:04.501 --> 00:31:05.821]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:31:05.821 --> 00:31:07.021]  Why is this so good?
[00:31:07.021 --> 00:31:12.323]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:31:12.323 --> 00:31:25.846]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:31:25.846 --> 00:31:27.207]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:31:28.007 --> 00:31:29.648]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:31:29.648 --> 00:31:32.209]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:31:32.209 --> 00:31:33.510]  These are all parasites.
[00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:34.610]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:35.971]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:31:35.971 --> 00:31:40.473]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:31:40.473 --> 00:31:43.615]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:46.756]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:31:46.756 --> 00:31:47.836]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:31:47.836 --> 00:31:49.777]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.

[00:33:15.373 --> 00:33:22.720]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting near a Y, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:30.546]  One of the biggest attacks we see out there from the corporate mouthpiece media is that I'm a fear monger.
[00:33:30.546 --> 00:33:32.528]  That I'm trying to scare people.
[00:33:32.528 --> 00:33:38.233]  And I jump right into that bribe patch and I say, absolutely, I'm trying to scare people.
[00:33:38.233 --> 00:33:41.196]  Because I'm... I'm not scared.
[00:33:42.338 --> 00:33:55.816]  Something happens as a male, as a man, if you are a man, and I'm not bragging, it's just, it clicks, is that when you know everybody's in danger, and you know you're right, and you've got children especially, something clicks and you don't have fear anymore.
[00:33:55.816 --> 00:33:59.661]  You have concern and a duty and a will to face it.
[00:34:01.104 --> 00:34:08.309]  And I'm telling you, most men never become men because they don't tap into that and that sense of purpose and that drive.
[00:34:08.309 --> 00:34:14.093]  And then all your instincts, your ancestors, God, your spirit, everything turns on.
[00:34:14.093 --> 00:34:21.659]  And I know why the average man who may have experienced this a few times doesn't want to experience it, because it's a lot to be a man.
[00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:24.121]  It's big.
[00:34:24.121 --> 00:34:25.082]  It's old.
[00:34:25.082 --> 00:34:25.522]  It's real.
[00:34:28.223 --> 00:34:34.006]  And anybody that's a man out there can look at what's going on.
[00:34:34.006 --> 00:34:46.091]  And the Armageddon level scenarios that lay out before us, the minefield that we're walking through with our children and our culture and our women.
[00:34:48.627 --> 00:34:52.191]  Is the most danger the species has ever been.
[00:34:52.191 --> 00:34:59.119]  All of my instincts, my spirit, my gut, every bit of it is on a knife's edge right now.
[00:34:59.119 --> 00:35:05.967]  Crying out, people wake up, repent, get on your knees, turn this around, don't go down this road.
[00:35:05.967 --> 00:35:06.647]  Danger!
[00:35:06.647 --> 00:35:07.288]  Danger!
[00:35:07.288 --> 00:35:07.869]  Danger!
[00:35:07.869 --> 00:35:08.389]  Danger!
[00:35:08.389 --> 00:35:08.750]  Danger!
[00:35:11.127 --> 00:35:13.948]  The babies with three parents.
[00:35:13.948 --> 00:35:16.709]  The chimera mutant creatures.
[00:35:16.709 --> 00:35:23.832]  Our government openly funding the most satanic, evil, jihadis.
[00:35:23.832 --> 00:35:26.793]  Obama making jokes about it.
[00:35:26.793 --> 00:35:33.676]  Some people say I need to bring in, I can't really do a good Obama imitation when I can't Bill Clinton.
[00:35:33.676 --> 00:35:35.097]  Here, I'll do Obama in the voice of Clinton.
[00:35:35.097 --> 00:35:35.877]  It's the same spirit.
[00:35:36.903 --> 00:35:40.046]  Some people think we gotta just bring in Christians from Syria.
[00:35:40.046 --> 00:35:40.886]  We're not gonna do that.
[00:35:40.886 --> 00:35:41.747]  That's not fair.
[00:35:41.747 --> 00:35:43.368]  We're gonna bring everybody in.
[00:35:43.368 --> 00:35:51.455]  But what he didn't tell you that he laughs, a little chuckle, is they know full well they let 0.4% in when Syria's 20% Christian or was.
[00:35:51.455 --> 00:35:54.017]  I mean, they are not letting Christians out.
[00:35:54.017 --> 00:36:00.102]  And I gotta sit there and watch him have a little enjoyment.
[00:36:00.102 --> 00:36:03.865]  Only time I see Obama and he has any real enjoyment is when Christians are getting killed.
[00:36:03.865 --> 00:36:06.007]  And I'm like, what is in that guy?
[00:36:06.007 --> 00:36:06.147]  What?
[00:36:07.202 --> 00:36:11.905]  What spirit?
[00:36:11.905 --> 00:36:25.153]  And if I've got one complaint, it's that I've got to look at Obama, I've got to look at Michael Moore, I've got to look at Hillary, I've got to look at Michelle, who are all just crazed, power-hungry demons, just looking at everybody like they want to tear everybody apart.
[00:36:25.153 --> 00:36:28.436]  I mean, where is the discernment of people?
[00:36:28.436 --> 00:36:32.838]  When you look at Hillary, that is a visible demon.
[00:36:32.838 --> 00:36:35.240]  Probably the most evil-looking person I've ever seen in my life.
[00:36:36.348 --> 00:36:43.692]  I mean, that big joker face, that plastic face, I mean... And then what she does is the proof of it all.
[00:36:43.692 --> 00:36:58.981]  She'll walk around on stage for an hour with her mouth wide open like a... like a... angler fish.
[00:36:58.981 --> 00:36:59.682]  Drunk on blood.
[00:36:59.682 --> 00:37:04.204]  Drunk on the blood of the innocent.
[00:37:04.204 --> 00:37:04.865]  God deliver us.
[00:37:09.025 --> 00:37:10.646]  God, I've got a bunch of clips here.
[00:37:10.646 --> 00:37:16.788]  I want to get to the State Department threatening Russia with Al-Qaeda forces.
[00:37:16.788 --> 00:37:20.010]  They say ISIS, but it's the same thing.
[00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:26.053]  And we've got Trump ahead in a bunch of polls.
[00:37:26.053 --> 00:37:27.553]  We've got a lot of other important news here.
[00:37:27.553 --> 00:37:30.915]  We've got the FBI openly admitting what came out in the news last week.
[00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:33.476]  That, oh, they were never going to prosecute anybody.
[00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:42.071]  And then, oh, they attacked Infowars, and oh, they attacked Daily Caller, and oh, they attacked Drudge, and everybody else, because we said, oh, look at this document.
[00:37:42.071 --> 00:37:45.112]  The FBI admits they were never going to prosecute anybody.
[00:37:45.112 --> 00:37:47.372]  And, oh, shut up, conspiracy theorist!
[00:37:47.372 --> 00:37:49.733]  And then it turns out it's all true.
[00:37:49.733 --> 00:37:52.413]  Well, it didn't turn out.
[00:37:52.413 --> 00:37:53.053]  It always was.
[00:37:53.053 --> 00:37:54.073]  We had the FBI document.
[00:37:54.073 --> 00:37:54.573]  It was admitted.
[00:37:54.573 --> 00:37:56.714]  It came out to Congress.
[00:37:56.714 --> 00:38:03.655]  By the way, you see this massive censorship of the media, of nationalists, of patriots, of people that just aren't in the cult of death?
[00:38:04.656 --> 00:38:07.397]  Those of us that don't want to blow the planet up.
[00:38:07.397 --> 00:38:10.357]  Those of us that don't get mad at our neighbor if they have a bigger swimming pool than us.
[00:38:10.357 --> 00:38:17.219]  You know, those of us that just like prosperity and never get tired of the simple things.
[00:38:17.219 --> 00:38:20.220]  Those of us that don't want to grab kids out of, you know, backyards and torture them.
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:21.080]  You know, people like us.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.220]  You know, just, we're not perfect.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:26.461]  We just don't want to, you know, murder Christians for no reason.
[00:38:26.461 --> 00:38:28.522]  We're just not out to screw everybody over.
[00:38:28.522 --> 00:38:29.282]  The bad guys.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.421]  The Pope took over the Catholic Church.
[00:38:35.421 --> 00:38:42.284]  Say what you wanted about the Catholic Church before, it did a lot of good in some of its activities.
[00:38:42.284 --> 00:38:44.365]  I mean, I just judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:38:44.365 --> 00:38:46.746]  And I'm not Catholic, I just study it.
[00:38:46.746 --> 00:38:56.351]  But then they come in with the left, through the seminaries, through the Jesuits, and infiltrate it with pedophile groups, to then blackmail the church, trick the church into not kicking it out early in the 50s.
[00:38:59.977 --> 00:39:12.600]  Take it over, and then officially they admit, have the Jesuits, mostly the guardians of the church, blackmail it, and put the black Pope in power.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:18.441]  That's what they call, again, they have the Jesuits, folks, before the news says he called him black in a derogatory term.
[00:39:18.441 --> 00:39:20.021]  Jones, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[00:39:20.021 --> 00:39:23.302]  I mean, this is amazing.
[00:39:23.302 --> 00:39:29.023]  Savage, censored, as Pope calls journalists terrorists, he said, those that engage in conspiracy theories
[00:39:31.252 --> 00:39:32.452]  Are, quote, deplorable.
[00:39:32.452 --> 00:39:33.753]  He's following the same script.
[00:39:33.753 --> 00:39:36.194]  Hell, the Jesuits probably wrote the script for Hillary.
[00:39:36.194 --> 00:39:37.074]  That's what a lot of folks think.
[00:39:37.074 --> 00:39:45.277]  That's what, that's actually what Steve Pachetnik, who's on tomorrow, was the former head of psychological warfare for the State Department.
[00:39:45.277 --> 00:39:47.778]  Oh, he's on today, excuse me, and other agencies.
[00:39:47.778 --> 00:39:54.361]  He was on, what, two weeks ago, and he said, this looks like Jesuit propaganda coming out of Hillary.
[00:39:54.361 --> 00:39:58.962]  Because Tim Kaine's a Jesuit, and then now you see him with the exact same words.
[00:39:58.962 --> 00:40:00.243]  We're terrorists now.
[00:40:02.574 --> 00:40:07.398]  What did the UN say in the Washington Post yesterday in their human rights panel that came out?
[00:40:07.398 --> 00:40:14.002]  That Saudi Arabia and Qatar had a... That's funny, it'd be like having Hitler oversee the Nuremberg Trials.
[00:40:14.002 --> 00:40:15.724]  Or having a fox again oversee the hen house.
[00:40:18.752 --> 00:40:25.756]  They came out and they said, America engaged in terrorism against black people, and so America owes reparations.
[00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:27.577]  See, we're terrorists now.
[00:40:27.577 --> 00:40:28.678]  Oh, you're starting to see.
[00:40:28.678 --> 00:40:30.138]  You're Russian agents.
[00:40:30.138 --> 00:40:31.599]  You're terrorists.
[00:40:31.599 --> 00:40:35.121]  You're a journalist that points out Obamacare isn't free.
[00:40:35.121 --> 00:40:37.182]  You can't keep your doctor.
[00:40:37.182 --> 00:40:39.824]  It was written by foreign insurance companies to screw you.
[00:40:39.824 --> 00:40:41.825]  There are penalties of $5,000 a year, up to.
[00:40:44.912 --> 00:40:46.153]  How do you counter that?
[00:40:46.153 --> 00:40:58.958]  Well, you have the supposed religious leader of the biggest single religious sect in the world, Catholicism, come out and tell you that you are a deplorable terrorist.
[00:40:58.958 --> 00:41:09.043]  And I have been listed by name, by Hillary Clinton, as a dark heart, quite frankly, king of the deplorables.
[00:41:09.043 --> 00:41:12.645]  You know what I'm the king of?
[00:41:12.645 --> 00:41:13.085]  Seeing you.
[00:41:14.642 --> 00:41:17.423]  I see you, okay?
[00:41:17.423 --> 00:41:18.863]  And I'm gonna tell you why.
[00:41:18.863 --> 00:41:19.943]  I'm a wicked person.
[00:41:19.943 --> 00:41:34.667]  I mean, my good overbalances, I love God, I go with God, but I've always been able to just read the wicked's handwriting better than they can read it.
[00:41:34.667 --> 00:41:36.768]  And now, there's no need to even be able to read their handwriting.
[00:41:36.768 --> 00:41:38.068]  It's running the world.
[00:41:38.068 --> 00:41:41.189]  I mean, this is a nice taste of a devil-run planet right here, baby.
[00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:47.751]  And I know the energies these people have given into.
[00:41:47.751 --> 00:41:52.932]  And I know where they take you.
[00:41:52.932 --> 00:41:59.033]  I haven't gone too far down the rabbit hole, but I've gone further than most that didn't succumb to it, let me tell you.
[00:41:59.033 --> 00:42:03.674]  I know what goes on inside their heads.
[00:42:03.674 --> 00:42:07.155]  It's a roar.
[00:42:07.155 --> 00:42:10.075]  Like a thousand jet engines.
[00:42:10.075 --> 00:42:12.576]  And it wants to kill this planet.
[00:42:16.411 --> 00:42:29.863]  They're hiring a kite, folks, on pit of hell, satanic rage.
[00:42:29.863 --> 00:42:32.565]  And they want to kill you and your family.
[00:42:32.565 --> 00:42:42.894]  And they want to first mutate every plant and every animal and have disease and pain and suffering and keep you alive through excruciating pain to milk it and imprison as many people as they can and just
[00:42:44.008 --> 00:42:51.952]  Just absolutely just mutilate and vandalize God's creation.
[00:42:51.952 --> 00:42:59.637]  In the words of the cartoon version of Aged Frelix, I want a you-know-what all over the Western world.
[00:42:59.637 --> 00:43:06.100]  And in the empty soulless mind of Carl the Cuck, oh yeah, that'd be great!
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:10.203]  Because they're big game hunters, folks.
[00:43:11.684 --> 00:43:14.907]  And they can mount America's head on the wall and teach us to be the engine of evil?
[00:43:14.907 --> 00:43:36.124]  It was Bismarck said... Bismarck said, God loves... God loves and gives providence to children, drunks, and the United States of America.
[00:43:37.577 --> 00:43:38.117]  Check me on that.
[00:43:38.117 --> 00:43:39.599]  I think that's Bismarck.
[00:43:39.599 --> 00:43:44.462]  This is Providence, the quote, God loves children, drunks, the United States of America.
[00:43:44.462 --> 00:43:44.962]  It's Bismarck.
[00:43:44.962 --> 00:43:47.144]  Pull it up for me, please.
[00:43:47.144 --> 00:43:52.708]  Unified Germany.
[00:43:52.708 --> 00:43:55.690]  God did love the United States of America.
[00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:57.191]  Because of the Providence.
[00:43:57.191 --> 00:43:58.712]  Because of the reason it was founded.
[00:43:58.712 --> 00:44:01.414]  And look how great it's been.
[00:44:01.414 --> 00:44:02.275]  Look how special it's been.
[00:44:02.275 --> 00:44:06.458]  And now we've been captured and used to build this satanic kingdom.
[00:44:09.252 --> 00:44:17.836]  And now it intends to rise above the nation states and lay all the other nation states down low below it.
[00:44:17.836 --> 00:44:27.041]  Tear everything apart and reconstruct the rubble in a new planet.
[00:44:27.041 --> 00:44:30.863]  That's what the high-level initiates believe they're going to get.
[00:44:30.863 --> 00:44:36.686]  But if they took one look into the energy force that's behind them, they would know this isn't
[00:44:41.465 --> 00:44:45.289]  Creative destruction.
[00:44:45.289 --> 00:44:49.312]  Because the devil is never a maker.
[00:44:49.312 --> 00:44:52.155]  The devil is a betrayer and a taker.
[00:44:55.523 --> 00:44:58.805]  I want to go to break, speaking of the devil being a taker and a betrayer.
[00:44:58.805 --> 00:45:10.812]  Obama looking for that poor black woman in Florida who said, I've got a car, we live in the car, we try to shower at the YMCA, but we just want like a little house and I work a couple jobs, but it just doesn't pay for it.
[00:45:10.812 --> 00:45:12.793]  So that's how they set up a society now.
[00:45:12.793 --> 00:45:15.675]  So you have to go to the government unless you break through to the middle class.
[00:45:17.486 --> 00:45:18.286]  He says, we're going to help you.
[00:45:18.286 --> 00:45:19.107]  We're going to get you that car.
[00:45:19.107 --> 00:45:21.108]  I mean, we're going to get you that house.
[00:45:21.108 --> 00:45:23.129]  Two years later, she didn't have anything.
[00:45:23.129 --> 00:45:26.890]  And local Patriot Christian conservatives got the lady a house and now she's doing well.
[00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:31.112]  Got out of the poverty cycle.
[00:45:31.112 --> 00:45:35.715]  Think of the PR stunt of some rich California donor or someone to come and help that poor old black lady.
[00:45:35.715 --> 00:45:38.216]  They don't want more people knocking on that door.
[00:45:38.216 --> 00:45:39.256]  They don't want to help you.
[00:45:39.256 --> 00:45:40.397]  They want to keep you down.
[00:45:47.998 --> 00:46:04.306]  George Soros only picks cases of rightful police shootings, so that he can cause a riot, cause division, and then create massive racism against black people, and scapegoat them for what's happening, at the same time as scapegoating the cops and local government.
[00:46:04.306 --> 00:46:15.451]  See, just like, just like Hillary, just like Hillary, and the emails came out, we knew this at the time, from our sources, Chicago Police,
[00:46:17.682 --> 00:46:24.009]  That they would send people in, bus them in, but it was Hillary who paid for it, it was MoveOn who paid for it, George Soros paid for it, that group.
[00:46:24.009 --> 00:46:29.195]  They'd send the buses in, they'd give them all Bernie shirts.
[00:46:29.195 --> 00:46:37.385]  And most of the Democrats were so dumb, they were getting paid 50 bucks a day plus lunch, and I'm told it's more pay now.
[00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:49.276]  There's folks bitching on tape about how low the pay is, and they tell them, they go typecast, find folks that are angry, they give them a Bernie shirt, they think they're even with the Bernie campaign, they don't check, move on, move on, oh that's with Bernie.
[00:46:49.276 --> 00:46:50.037]  Don't know.
[00:46:50.037 --> 00:46:51.157]  White, black, you name it.
[00:46:51.157 --> 00:46:54.359]  Just angry, you know, thugs.
[00:46:54.359 --> 00:47:01.944]  They dump them out, let's go fight the racists, they go attack the Trump people, the media claims Trump did it.
[00:47:01.944 --> 00:47:03.705]  This is full spectrum dominance, this is an example.
[00:47:04.591 --> 00:47:08.034]  But then Trump then comes out and blames Sanders and the media.
[00:47:08.034 --> 00:47:12.038]  So Sanders gets hurt in the eyes of Democrats, her competitor.
[00:47:12.038 --> 00:47:15.221]  Trump gets hurt in the general eyes of everybody.
[00:47:15.221 --> 00:47:17.623]  And in the eyes of Hillary supporters.
[00:47:17.623 --> 00:47:18.944]  Driving everyone to Hillary.
[00:47:18.944 --> 00:47:21.647]  Now that is a checkers level move.
[00:47:21.647 --> 00:47:24.169]  The public can't get that.
[00:47:24.169 --> 00:47:24.749]  We have the proof.
[00:47:25.785 --> 00:47:26.766]  They're beyond chess.
[00:47:26.766 --> 00:47:36.035]  They're three levels, folks, and you've got to be able to just project into it and then see their algorithms, see their changes, see their moves, and then the whole picture comes into frame.
[00:47:36.035 --> 00:47:41.139]  So quite frankly, usually when I'm here covering one article or this, my brain's over here thinking about the larger picture.
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:45.961]  Just wanting to come and give you the larger picture and just say, look, you've seen enough evidence.
[00:47:45.961 --> 00:47:48.741]  I mean, look, here's the Pope today saying, go after the free press.
[00:47:48.741 --> 00:47:51.462]  I mean, more hacked emails from Soros.
[00:47:51.462 --> 00:47:56.043]  You know, how to defend radical Muslims and keep the borders open and demonize, quote, anybody that's Islamophobic.
[00:47:56.043 --> 00:48:00.724]  I'm going to come back from break and play this Darren McBreen piece.
[00:48:00.724 --> 00:48:04.385]  I'm talking about devilish betrayal.
[00:48:04.385 --> 00:48:06.025]  Knowing that it would put
[00:48:07.898 --> 00:48:20.745]  Just what we estimated, economists estimated, 35 million people or more, I haven't checked in a year or so, have gone from full-time employment to part-time under Obamacare and then lost any benefits they had.
[00:48:20.745 --> 00:48:23.746]  By the way, employers want to pay people more.
[00:48:23.746 --> 00:48:25.747]  They want to find the really good employees.
[00:48:25.747 --> 00:48:29.169]  They want you to then be taken care of and want to stay there and then help find other people.
[00:48:29.169 --> 00:48:34.992]  So, once you get kicked out of full-time, you're never even seen as somebody that works there.
[00:48:34.992 --> 00:48:36.533]  So now, upward mobility has been
[00:48:38.036 --> 00:48:40.820]  35 million people, like that, went to part-time.
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:43.443]  You didn't get Obamacare.
[00:48:43.443 --> 00:48:48.510]  The prices of healthcare have more than doubled.
[00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:49.691]  That's on average.
[00:48:49.691 --> 00:48:52.355]  It's gone up even more for a lot of people.
[00:48:52.355 --> 00:48:53.196]  And there's penalties.
[00:48:55.851 --> 00:49:00.055]  And they sit up there and they look at you and they go, it's a lie.
[00:49:00.055 --> 00:49:07.381]  The same guy that thinks there's giant wasp under the UN building, Alex Jones, says that you can't keep your doctor and that there's death panels.
[00:49:07.381 --> 00:49:12.726]  And then she sits there with that little chicken neck and that short haircut and smacks her lips with her glassy eyes and goes, see?
[00:49:12.726 --> 00:49:13.506]  He's crazy.
[00:49:13.506 --> 00:49:14.327]  He's crazy.
[00:49:14.327 --> 00:49:15.448]  We have to find that clip.
[00:49:15.448 --> 00:49:20.853]  They say Obama's going to rip you off and there's death panels and there's penalties in the IRS.
[00:49:20.853 --> 00:49:23.215]  This is what goes on in the delusional mind of right-wing crazies.
[00:49:24.659 --> 00:49:27.961]  And she knows full well it's in there, but she's betraying you!
[00:49:27.961 --> 00:49:37.146]  Imagine how cold it is in those offices with a bunch of vampires, all like, fake, and all gen-peck each other on who's more liberal and that's not the proper language.
[00:49:37.146 --> 00:49:41.509]  They're the most unhappy people on Earth.
[00:49:41.509 --> 00:49:46.172]  Oh my God, thank God we're not these people!
[00:49:46.172 --> 00:49:49.474]  I mean, I'm sorry, they're just pure evil!
[00:49:49.474 --> 00:49:53.156]  And then, the penalties start kicking in.
[00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:00.230]  We're paying them right now!
[00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:02.151]  Because most of my crew doesn't even want them!
[00:50:02.151 --> 00:50:03.571]  Want Obamacare!
[00:50:03.571 --> 00:50:05.372]  And they just say, it doesn't exist!
[00:50:05.372 --> 00:50:06.452]  You're dehumanized!
[00:50:06.452 --> 00:50:07.372]  You never existed!
[00:50:07.372 --> 00:50:16.134]  I have employees walk to me and go, yeah, I guess we might as well get Obamacare, because even though I didn't get the right insurance, they're hitting me with $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, and I go, doesn't exist!
[00:50:16.134 --> 00:50:16.814]  Doesn't exist!
[00:50:16.814 --> 00:50:17.275]  Doesn't exist!
[00:50:20.478 --> 00:50:22.479]  Slappy in the face doesn't exist.
[00:50:22.479 --> 00:50:23.480]  That's the insult.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.621]  They sit there and they always lecture.
[00:50:25.621 --> 00:50:27.102]  They're not using the right words.
[00:50:27.102 --> 00:50:27.682]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:50:27.682 --> 00:50:28.783]  You need to use the right words.
[00:50:28.783 --> 00:50:30.784]  Listen, I need to plug.

[00:51:44.334 --> 00:51:44.614]  My razor.
[00:51:44.614 --> 00:51:46.255]  Trying to save money on blades.
[00:51:46.255 --> 00:51:47.657]  You should try Harry's.
[00:51:47.657 --> 00:51:48.017]  Harry's?
[00:52:08.274 --> 00:52:10.375]  I think I read an article in the journal about them.
[00:52:10.375 --> 00:52:14.277]  The two guys who started that company with its own factory in Germany?
[00:52:14.277 --> 00:52:14.898]  Right.
[00:52:14.898 --> 00:52:16.098]  And they sell online.

[00:54:04.403 --> 00:54:10.007]  Here's Jeremy Green's report on the tax that Obama promised wasn't in the bill.
[00:54:10.007 --> 00:54:13.570]  And the media lied and said that it didn't exist, even though it did exist.
[00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:14.691]  That's how dumb they think we are.
[00:54:16.226 --> 00:54:21.690]  We will start by reducing premiums by as much as $2,500 per family.
[00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:28.415]  A system where we're going to work with your employers to lower your premiums by up to $2,500 per family per year.
[00:54:28.415 --> 00:54:36.862]  Here's what change is saying to people who already have health insurance and the employers who are providing it, we'll work to lower your premiums by up to $2,500 per family per year.
[00:54:38.863 --> 00:54:44.227]  I also have a health care plan that would save the average family $2,500 on their premiums.
[00:54:44.227 --> 00:54:52.012]  And if you already have health care, then we're going to reduce costs an average of $2,500 per family on premiums.
[00:54:52.012 --> 00:54:55.494]  It's time to bring down the typical family premium by $2,500.
[00:54:55.494 --> 00:54:59.297]  It's time to bring down the costs for the entire country.
[00:54:59.497 --> 00:55:04.042]  And we'll cut the cost of a typical family's health care by up to $2,500 per year.
[00:55:04.042 --> 00:55:12.210]  Well, internet pioneer Matt Drudge created a firestorm over the weekend tweeting, just paid the Obamacare penalty for not getting covered.
[00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:13.951]  I'm calling it a liberty tax.
[00:55:13.951 --> 00:55:18.856]  But a White House representative firing back tweeting, flat lie, no fee for previous years.
[00:55:18.856 --> 00:55:20.478]  Scary how much influence he once had.
[00:55:20.538 --> 00:55:33.046]  The Obama administration and the liberal media have told us again and again and again that there is no individual mandate that requires us to buy health insurance.
[00:55:33.046 --> 00:55:35.447]  If you don't want it, you don't have to buy it, right?
[00:55:35.447 --> 00:55:40.771]  But when tax season comes around, you better be ready to pay the price big time.
[00:55:40.771 --> 00:55:47.095]  And that's because if you don't have health insurance, there is a stiff penalty.
[00:55:47.375 --> 00:55:51.818]  Americans who don't buy health care coverage will face a heftier fine in 2016.
[00:55:51.818 --> 00:55:57.822]  There are 10.5 million uninsured Americans eligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
[00:55:57.822 --> 00:56:05.627]  But the Obama administration expects only a quarter will sign up this year, even though those that don't could pay a higher penalty in their taxes.
[00:56:05.627 --> 00:56:06.547]  That's almost a 50% jump.
[00:56:07.688 --> 00:56:07.888]  I think.
[00:56:22.585 --> 00:56:36.656]  Now, new data from the IRS reveals that in 2014, over 8 million Americans paid a staggering $1.7 billion in Obamacare penalties.
[00:56:36.656 --> 00:56:42.560]  And we know that that number is expected to be even higher, much higher in 2015, 2016, and beyond.
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:46.163]  So let me get this straight.
[00:56:46.163 --> 00:56:49.966]  Obamacare was passed because people couldn't afford health insurance.
[00:56:50.546 --> 00:56:58.231]  But now, because of Obamacare, people are being heavily fined because they can't afford health insurance.
[00:56:58.231 --> 00:57:02.814]  Premiums are up and some people have decided they're not so affordable.
[00:57:02.814 --> 00:57:04.836]  Premiums have also increased.
[00:57:04.836 --> 00:57:07.698]  The cost of a mid-level plan is up an average of 7.5%.
[00:57:07.698 --> 00:57:09.239]  Way more than that.
[00:57:09.239 --> 00:57:13.001]  It's due in part because a number of companies have left the marketplace.
[00:57:13.001 --> 00:57:15.223]  Fewer insurers means less competition.
[00:57:15.723 --> 00:57:18.904]  No, I actually didn't know the penalty was that high.
[00:57:18.904 --> 00:57:26.247]  And if you own a business, chances are you too are getting effed over by Obamacare.
[00:57:26.247 --> 00:57:33.409]  First, the employer mandate, as you mentioned, kicks in for companies with 100 or more people and some of them are going to decide this may not be worth the cost.
[00:57:33.909 --> 00:57:42.035]  But even those with 50 to 99 people are going to have to make very detailed monthly statements in terms of getting ready for this thing.
[00:57:42.035 --> 00:57:45.717]  And companies with under 50 people are going to have some surprises.
[00:57:45.717 --> 00:57:50.040]  For example, if you own two small businesses, the federal government combines those.
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:53.443]  So you may be picked up by this even if you don't realize it yet.
[00:57:53.783 --> 00:58:00.147]  However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and his name is Donald Trump.
[00:58:00.147 --> 00:58:06.191]  And his plan for healthcare reform is easily accessible on his website, donaldtrump.com.
[00:58:06.191 --> 00:58:09.494]  It's all laid out in plain English for everyone to see.
[00:58:10.234 --> 00:58:23.840]  Economic and financial experts agree that it is, well it's a rock-solid plan to repeal the incredible economic burden of Obamacare once and for all.
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.721]  What's your plan for Obamacare?
[00:58:25.721 --> 00:58:28.382]  Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced.
[00:58:28.382 --> 00:58:33.004]  I'm Darren McBreen and you can watch more reports right now at InfoWars.com
[00:58:34.164 --> 00:58:34.965]  Great job, Darren.
[00:58:34.965 --> 00:58:37.366]  Hour number two is only 70 seconds away.
[00:58:37.366 --> 00:58:41.828]  And again, the only other part that didn't get added is this massively increases the price of health care overall.

[00:59:49.506 --> 00:59:50.807]  Check it out for yourself today.
[00:59:54.941 --> 01:00:05.493]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.493 --> 01:00:07.335]  We are on the march.
[01:00:07.335 --> 01:00:10.499]  The empire is on the run.
[01:00:10.499 --> 01:00:14.103]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:22.455 --> 01:00:34.999]  By the way, this came out a few weeks ago, and I haven't really covered it yet, just because I don't see a person that actually dedicates most of their time to trying to destroy me.
[01:00:34.999 --> 01:00:39.021]  I mean, he's obsessed with me probably more than anybody else but Drudge or Trump.
[01:00:39.021 --> 01:00:48.944]  And that's Mr. Brock over at Media Matters, former transition chief for Obama, who is over there heading up things.
[01:00:52.694 --> 01:00:53.775]  I mean, I have a blind spot.
[01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:58.057]  I mean, I don't really just care about, you know, one particular spider.
[01:00:58.057 --> 01:00:59.558]  I want to get the whole nest.
[01:00:59.558 --> 01:01:05.101]  But it's been pointed out to me by folks in the office and others, why aren't you covering this David Brock thing?
[01:01:05.101 --> 01:01:06.802]  Well, we've now had time to research it deeply.
[01:01:06.802 --> 01:01:09.123]  It's worse than what was even being reported.
[01:01:09.123 --> 01:01:12.845]  Clinton shill David Brock caught laundering money is the headline.
[01:01:12.845 --> 01:01:14.586]  Media Matters founder exposed.
[01:01:14.586 --> 01:01:16.187]  Pretty hardcore.
[01:01:16.187 --> 01:01:17.627]  And it's a very accurate
[01:01:19.784 --> 01:01:22.626]  Owen Schroyer, latest addition to the InfoWars.com.
[01:01:22.626 --> 01:01:23.507]  A blessing to have him here.
[01:01:23.507 --> 01:01:25.048]  He's doing a great job on here.
[01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:27.590]  It really augments and fits in nice to the rest of the crew.
[01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:29.171]  He's going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:01:29.171 --> 01:01:32.493]  We have a special report on that.
[01:01:32.493 --> 01:01:36.036]  But this is just like the Clinton Foundation or the Global Clinton Initiative or any of it.
[01:01:36.036 --> 01:01:38.878]  This is a criminal enterprise.
[01:01:38.878 --> 01:01:41.780]  And they violate the laws on quote tax-exempt groups.
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.902]  That's only the surface of it.
[01:01:45.072 --> 01:01:51.837]  I remember the memo that came out five years ago in Politico where they said, we're going to infiltrate right-wing alternative media.
[01:01:51.837 --> 01:01:52.998]  We're going to bring them down.
[01:01:52.998 --> 01:01:54.899]  And you've seen that with Fox News.
[01:01:54.899 --> 01:01:58.502]  I mean, they're not playing games.
[01:01:58.502 --> 01:02:06.968]  And I love the little fake pretentious hair that sticks up eight inches above his head and all hair sprayed to make it look like he's got some giant brain.
[01:02:06.968 --> 01:02:11.091]  I mean, why not just wear a big alien skullcap like your Mars attacks?
[01:02:13.131 --> 01:02:16.492]  These people are all such delicate geniuses, but you gotta try to have a conversation with them.
[01:02:16.492 --> 01:02:18.232]  They're just a bunch of rats.
[01:02:18.232 --> 01:02:20.072]  They're not even good at propaganda.
[01:02:20.072 --> 01:02:23.533]  I mean, I can tell you right now, these people are a joke.
[01:02:23.533 --> 01:02:27.094]  The Daily Beast even asked, can anyone ever truly trust David Brock?
[01:02:27.094 --> 01:02:33.595]  See, they're getting ready to flush that little, uh, that little floater.
[01:02:33.595 --> 01:02:39.216]  That floater is, uh, you know, I think they might carve him off and throw him to the wolves.
[01:02:39.216 --> 01:02:40.636]  He just has that look about him, doesn't he?
[01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:46.791]  There's gotta be some treats, you know, after all this.
[01:02:46.791 --> 01:02:52.272]  Whether Hillary loses or wins or steals it, there's gonna have to be some treats.
[01:02:52.272 --> 01:03:03.595]  The American snacks, the American people want to see somebody burned for all this corruption.
[01:03:03.595 --> 01:03:08.717]  It just popped in my head, popped in my gut, just popped into my spirit.
[01:03:08.717 --> 01:03:12.558]  And I think the expiration date on old Brocky Boy is just about up.
[01:03:14.557 --> 01:03:17.219]  And I don't say that with pleasure.
[01:03:17.219 --> 01:03:24.563]  That's why I had men on my radar screen lie about me, twist, attack me on a daily basis.
[01:03:24.563 --> 01:03:26.404]  And again, Media Matters doesn't have a lot of traffic.
[01:03:26.404 --> 01:03:36.730]  It's a small news site, you know, talking point memo from the White House and the Clintons and Soros admittedly funds it and out of that nest.
[01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:42.094]  But then it's regurgitated on what's left of the cable news system.
[01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:44.491]  I mean, word for word.
[01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:57.722]  In fact, we saw the propaganda that Roger Stone's the Russian spy and all this stuff yesterday on C-SPAN with the FBI director being asked by Adler.
[01:03:57.722 --> 01:03:59.003]  I don't attack fat people.
[01:03:59.003 --> 01:03:59.764]  I've been fat before.
[01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:06.770]  You know, it's like Roger Stone said, if he says, you know, I'm involved in treason, I'm gonna sue his fat ass.
[01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:13.852]  You gotta wonder how Adler is so old and still alive, because if you see him walking around, folks, he is, looks like he weighs 600 pounds.
[01:04:13.852 --> 01:04:20.953]  And I'm not attacking him for being fat, I'm just saying it's weird, like the good guy young, he's threatening Adler.
[01:04:20.953 --> 01:04:24.294]  No I'm not, I'm asking, how on earth
[01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:42.604]  Can you like have somebody like my dad's dad who was like a Golden Gloves boxing champion like six foot four and looked like a movie star and was pretty damn healthy and went on you know 10 mile walks almost every day and then his whole aorta blew up out of the top of his heart I guess it's just genetic.
[01:04:43.834 --> 01:04:55.989]  But then you can have somebody like Adler just waddling around for decades in Congress, spewing BS, saying that Roger Stone's a Russian agent because he dares criticize globalists that have taken over this country.
[01:04:55.989 --> 01:04:59.353]  And it's like, look, get back in your McDonald's commercials is the, you know, grimace.
[01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:10.353]  It's only recently that Trump has mainstreamed the term globalist so effectively that they can no longer hide from the label, but they still try to hide their true agenda.
[01:05:10.353 --> 01:05:17.715]  The Christian Post pointed out that globalism is a secular, humanistic religion of sorts that envisions a one-world government.
[01:05:17.715 --> 01:05:25.418]  An American Thinker article titled, Globalism the Religion of Empire, says the religion of globalism sees an earthly, utopian world order.
[01:05:25.618 --> 01:05:31.942]  In which all men pay allegiance to elite priests who rule over a world city without national borders.
[01:05:31.942 --> 01:05:38.207]  The globalists will erase not only geographical borders, but the boundaries on how government will intrude into your life.
[01:05:38.207 --> 01:05:42.029]  You can forget the First Amendment and the rest of the Bill of Rights if they succeed.
[01:05:42.029 --> 01:05:50.335]  Even those like Jeremy Rabban, who don't support Trump, see that the globalists seek to quote, organize the world in a way that establishes an artificial consensus.
[01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:52.596]  It's not enough to say it's undemocratic.
[01:05:52.596 --> 01:05:53.617]  It's threatening.
[01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:54.878]  It's almost demonic.
[01:05:54.878 --> 01:05:59.981]  It is a world organized independently of people's fundamental religious convictions.
[01:05:59.981 --> 01:06:01.662]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:06:20.795 --> 01:06:21.535]  I think so.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:42.720]  Thank you.

[01:07:31.167 --> 01:07:32.428]  This is the first release.
[01:07:32.428 --> 01:07:34.751]  And it was completely built from the ground up.
[01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:38.336]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks attempting to deceive you.
[01:07:38.576 --> 01:07:47.442]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces who are trying to sway public opinion in an unnatural direction that only serves establishment agendas.
[01:07:47.442 --> 01:07:52.486]  But InfoWars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.
[01:07:52.486 --> 01:07:59.831]  So download InfoWars Live today at InfoWars.com and learn what's really going on instead of being spoon-fed lies by the mainstream media.
[01:08:09.895 --> 01:08:11.096]  It's September 29th, 2016.
[01:08:11.096 --> 01:08:18.839]  Only 39 short days until the historic 2016 November election.
[01:08:18.839 --> 01:08:20.519]  We're so close you can almost touch it.
[01:08:20.519 --> 01:08:21.860]  Americanism versus Globalism.
[01:08:38.197 --> 01:08:41.979]  The New World Order corporate combine has hijacked our nation.
[01:08:41.979 --> 01:08:45.941]  Wants to tell us that sovereignty is racist and evil.
[01:08:45.941 --> 01:08:51.063]  And that if we go the way of the Brigs in the UK, we're somehow Russian agents.
[01:08:51.063 --> 01:08:54.785]  The truth is, Russia has nothing to do with this election.
[01:08:54.785 --> 01:08:59.027]  Other than the fact that Russia has already partially pulled away from the New World Order.
[01:09:04.452 --> 01:09:13.845]  It's now time for us to proudly join the UK and Russia in re-establishing national sovereignty and our constitutional republics.
[01:09:13.845 --> 01:09:19.212]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, broadcasting from Austin, Texas, worldwide.
[01:09:28.371 --> 01:09:30.632]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:09:30.632 --> 01:09:33.554]  Again, we're into the second hour of the Worldwide Broadcast.
[01:09:33.554 --> 01:09:44.120]  We have Mr. Scheuer joining us, our great reporter, who has broken down the admitted crimes of the White House operative Brock, David Brock.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.621]  So that is coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:09:45.621 --> 01:09:55.246]  It's just important to study the criminal organization and to look at this key capo who has the hair
[01:09:57.205 --> 01:10:11.372]  of a sycophant twit, and who has the demeanor of a scallywag, and who has the political acumen of a pirate.
[01:10:11.372 --> 01:10:13.173]  And I want to be clear.
[01:10:13.173 --> 01:10:21.537]  Pirates think, like cancer raging through the body, that just because they can rob, steal, and destroy, and sow chaos, they're geniuses.
[01:10:21.537 --> 01:10:23.938]  No, it's easy to burn a house down.
[01:10:23.938 --> 01:10:24.899]  It's hard to build one.
[01:10:27.699 --> 01:10:34.023]  It's easy to grab a kid out of their backyard and put them in your van and drive them off so the Saudis can have their way with them.
[01:10:34.023 --> 01:10:40.826]  It's hard to have a child and raise it and be loving.
[01:10:40.826 --> 01:10:46.289]  It's easy to sell crack on the side of the street corner.
[01:10:46.289 --> 01:10:49.451]  It's hard to build a civilization that has streets.
[01:10:49.451 --> 01:10:52.633]  And these people are pirates.
[01:10:52.633 --> 01:10:55.795]  They're looting everything and they have the same
[01:10:58.464 --> 01:11:06.731]  Dishonor that you would expect you'd see in grave robbers.
[01:11:06.731 --> 01:11:16.119]  But at least the grave robbers got the decency to lay to human dead a hundred years or so before they'd pull the rings off your fingers.
[01:11:19.326 --> 01:11:21.167]  They're doing it in broad daylight.
[01:11:21.167 --> 01:11:28.571]  And I go back to what I said last hour, because I've been thinking about everything we look at, Obamacare really is the greatest example of it.
[01:11:28.571 --> 01:11:35.996]  Everyone I know has seen their premiums go up 50% to 100% to 150%.
[01:11:35.996 --> 01:11:41.599]  Who it really hit was my parents, who might use their insurance once every 10 years.
[01:11:41.599 --> 01:11:47.243]  I think my mother hadn't used hers in like 20 years.
[01:11:47.243 --> 01:11:47.823]  It was ridiculous.
[01:11:50.706 --> 01:11:54.249]  And as soon as Obamacare passed three years ago, my dad got a letter, it was 37%.
[01:11:54.249 --> 01:11:56.050]  Another letter a few months later, another 20%.
[01:11:56.050 --> 01:11:57.151]  They know how to do it.
[01:11:57.151 --> 01:11:59.153]  I mean, now it's like 200%.
[01:11:59.153 --> 01:12:07.899]  So he went out and tried to find insurance and couldn't get anything that wasn't basically 100% what he was paying previously.
[01:12:07.899 --> 01:12:10.922]  Same here.
[01:12:10.922 --> 01:12:14.364]  I had insurance through GCN going back 18, 19 years.
[01:12:14.364 --> 01:12:15.645]  And Ted said, I can't afford it anymore.
[01:12:15.645 --> 01:12:16.826]  I'm getting rid of the pool.
[01:12:16.826 --> 01:12:18.007]  I went out to look for my own insurance.
[01:12:18.007 --> 01:12:20.129]  It was about double.
[01:12:21.232 --> 01:12:25.533]  I don't use my insurance either.
[01:12:25.533 --> 01:12:32.195]  And then you turn on the news and they say, it's not going up, everything's free, it's wonderful.
[01:12:32.195 --> 01:12:36.056]  Then you can keep your doctor, on and on and on.
[01:12:36.056 --> 01:12:41.377]  And then I sit here, and I go around over the years and I say, do people want health insurance here?
[01:12:41.377 --> 01:12:45.258]  Do you want me to, you know, go in, have a group plan, I pitch in, you pitch in?
[01:12:45.258 --> 01:12:48.599]  Both will say, no, my wife's got it, my husband's got it, or I'm gonna wing it, or no, I don't want it.
[01:12:49.437 --> 01:13:02.371]  Now, it's fully in place, folks, and I'll be charged $5,000 per employee, and they'll be charged, too, if they at least don't opt out of the health plan.
[01:13:07.151 --> 01:13:09.512]  And remember, most of these insurance companies are foreign.
[01:13:09.512 --> 01:13:10.713]  We've never had a tax.
[01:13:10.713 --> 01:13:16.296]  That's what we had, the Revolutionary War, was over foreign taxes and things like that to a foreign power.
[01:13:16.296 --> 01:13:18.177]  You know, the globalism of that age, colonialism.
[01:13:18.177 --> 01:13:23.479]  That's all globalism is, is a new form of corporate colonialism.
[01:13:23.479 --> 01:13:29.643]  And then I was talking to, again, crew members here in the office, where the first fine was, you know, $1,000 and $3,000 and then now it's, oh, $5,000.
[01:13:38.567 --> 01:13:46.115]  Oh, because, you know, you make a decent, you know, middle class wage.
[01:13:46.115 --> 01:13:49.058]  That's a lower middle class wage.
[01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:53.102]  We're going to take $5,000 from you.
[01:13:53.102 --> 01:13:58.127]  Because, see, they don't recognize most of these other cobbled together health plans you can get that are pretty decent.
[01:13:58.127 --> 01:13:58.847]  They don't recognize it.
[01:13:58.847 --> 01:14:01.270]  Big insurance companies wrote this to make you get it from them.
[01:14:03.646 --> 01:14:17.617]  And then when they're done making money off of it a few years, they're just gonna turn loose and then deny the whole thing, watch it collapse and go to single-payer, and then it'll make prices go up even more, there'll be two or three big companies left standing, that's the admitted plan, and then you've got to go to them.
[01:14:17.617 --> 01:14:26.845]  And Rahm Emanuel's brother, one of the architects of it, we ought to find that clip, it's Rahm Emanuel's brother admits Obamacare meant to create single-payer.
[01:14:28.436 --> 01:14:31.478]  Author of Obamacare admits plan is meant to create single-parents.
[01:14:31.478 --> 01:14:35.040]  Fox News, I think it's like Cavuto, three years ago.
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:43.064]  He's on there in person and says of course it's meant to bankrupt it and go to single-parent.
[01:14:43.064 --> 01:14:47.267]  But it isn't even cloward and piven to make it socialist, which would be bad enough because that's the state running healthcare.
[01:14:48.243 --> 01:14:50.183]  Getting rid of innovation and choice.
[01:14:50.183 --> 01:14:53.624]  It's big foreign corporations making you get it from them.
[01:14:53.624 --> 01:14:55.605]  I mean, that's so unconstitutional.
[01:14:55.605 --> 01:14:57.245]  That's so discriminatory.
[01:14:57.245 --> 01:14:59.526]  That's so... I called it a tax.
[01:14:59.526 --> 01:15:00.086]  Oh, you're a kook.
[01:15:00.086 --> 01:15:00.746]  It's not a tax.
[01:15:00.746 --> 01:15:06.447]  And then the Supreme Court says, well, Congress has the power to tax.
[01:15:06.447 --> 01:15:09.048]  But not an unconstitutional tax.
[01:15:09.048 --> 01:15:13.469]  And as soon as Obama let thousands of big companies opt out of Obamacare,
[01:15:15.407 --> 01:15:21.112]  The minute they did that, it was totally unconstitutional there, because it's an unfair weights and measures.
[01:15:21.112 --> 01:15:22.874]  It's discrimination on the face.
[01:15:22.874 --> 01:15:30.361]  But we only think of discrimination if, you know, you're black or you're white or the KKK burned a cross in your yard.
[01:15:30.361 --> 01:15:39.569]  The big massive discrimination is all of us having our privacy violated, all of us having to pay for illegal aliens, all of, including illegals that are already here getting killed by illegals.
[01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:53.221]  All of us having a ruling class that's above the law, that has bodyguards, taxpayer-paid for, and then we can't have guns in many areas they control.
[01:15:53.221 --> 01:15:58.625]  So, I mean, to me... I know that clip's easy to find.
[01:15:58.625 --> 01:16:03.369]  If you guys can't find it, because I know we didn't find it yesterday, go ask the other side to find it, or ask Paul Watson, because he's always the best at finding it.
[01:16:03.369 --> 01:16:05.471]  You guys are great, too, but I really want that clip.
[01:16:07.085 --> 01:16:08.546]  People say, oh, he just made that up.
[01:16:08.546 --> 01:16:10.746]  They never admitted it was just bankrupt everything.
[01:16:10.746 --> 01:16:12.687]  They never admitted it was just making a single pair.
[01:16:12.687 --> 01:16:13.868]  Yeah, they did.
[01:16:13.868 --> 01:16:18.969]  But you don't believe Gruber got up on different TV shows and said, thank God the public has no attention span.
[01:16:18.969 --> 01:16:20.390]  It's so stupid.
[01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:25.072]  You know, I was hired to hide the fact we were going to double and triple prices.
[01:16:25.072 --> 01:16:30.093]  And he does that Judge Schmelz laugh that we've got Charlie Rose yesterday.
[01:16:30.093 --> 01:16:33.975]  We played it for two days ago from Tuesday bragging
[01:16:36.443 --> 01:16:43.267]  I love that line we wrote as speechwriters about, if you like your doctor, you get him.
[01:16:43.267 --> 01:16:46.468]  We caught them good!
[01:16:46.468 --> 01:16:52.651]  Or the State Department spokesman, who is a paragon of justice and truth.
[01:16:52.651 --> 01:16:58.814]  Let me tell you another good one.
[01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:02.696]  Member Gibbs, former press secretary, is like, yeah, the drone program was public for years.
[01:17:02.696 --> 01:17:03.477]  It's all over the news.
[01:17:03.477 --> 01:17:04.017]  It's admitted.
[01:17:06.482 --> 01:17:09.104]  And I'm told to go on TV and say it doesn't exist.
[01:17:09.104 --> 01:17:11.286]  And then the anchors all laugh with him.
[01:17:11.286 --> 01:17:13.067]  It's fun!
[01:17:13.067 --> 01:17:15.469]  It's fun to rub your nose in it.
[01:17:15.469 --> 01:17:17.710]  It's fun to do that to you.
[01:17:17.710 --> 01:17:19.111]  It's fun!
[01:17:19.111 --> 01:17:33.582]  It's fun to have the Pope come out today in fullwars.com and say that any journalists that engage in conspiracy theories, quote, conspiracy theories, are terrorists.
[01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:34.783]  Conspiracy theorists are terrorists.
[01:17:36.072 --> 01:17:38.333]  Next level!
[01:17:38.333 --> 01:17:56.225]  Alright, I'm going to come back and actually get to the State Department news where they're threatening to launch terror attacks inside Russia, and of course the State Department's also come out and said, in writing, and so is NATO, that they will launch military physical attacks if they think, from the territory of Russia, or any of its allies, cyber attacks come.
[01:17:56.225 --> 01:17:58.926]  And that was first in writing, but people didn't believe it six months ago when we covered it.
[01:17:58.926 --> 01:18:02.889]  Then they came out about a month ago and said it on the news.
[01:18:02.889 --> 01:18:03.970]  Samantha Powers and others.
[01:18:05.916 --> 01:18:10.299]  We have the official press briefing saying, oh, if you don't get out of Syria, terrorists are going to hit you.
[01:18:10.299 --> 01:18:11.580]  We're going to break that down.
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:16.963]  Before I go any further, we have store-wide free shipping that will end today.
[01:18:16.963 --> 01:18:23.328]  The sale on Supermail and others has ended, but the store-wide free shipping ends tonight at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:18:23.328 --> 01:18:24.889]  And I want to thank you all for your support.

[01:18:34.555 --> 01:18:34.996]  I don't know.
[01:18:49.292 --> 01:18:49.793]  I don't think so.
[01:19:10.936 --> 01:19:14.320]  Or call toll free 888-253-3139.

[01:19:31.415 --> 01:19:36.598]  There's no reviews yet for the new Biome Defense Probiotic from InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:19:36.598 --> 01:19:39.579]  And that's because it obviously just started shipping out yesterday.
[01:19:39.579 --> 01:19:41.860]  It got in last week in the refrigerated area.
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:43.101]  It started shipping out yesterday.

[01:22:01.874 --> 01:22:04.526]  Today, I became a biophoton woman.
[01:22:04.526 --> 01:22:05.972]  I put a tablespoon of deandre
[01:22:12.125 --> 01:22:17.368]  Normally, I feel tired and spacey at the end of the day, but today I felt energy and very clear.
[01:22:17.368 --> 01:22:19.909]  My friend at the farmer's market asked what I was on.
[01:22:19.909 --> 01:22:24.351]  She said my eyes looked bright and I had unusual energy for that time of afternoon.
[01:22:24.351 --> 01:22:29.874]  I told her it was a magical oil that enabled my body to absorb the sun's energy as if I were a plant.
[01:22:29.874 --> 01:22:31.595]  She said, I want some.
[01:22:31.595 --> 01:22:38.399]  A second One World Way shake with the oil when I got home took me to bedtime with that wonderful, abundant energy.
[01:22:38.399 --> 01:22:40.600]  I couldn't believe how much I got done and how
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:47.283]  The combination of One World Way and Five Seed Oil produced a significant health event in my life.
[01:22:47.283 --> 01:22:50.944]  The kind that makes you feel you've been given your life back with a bonus.

[01:23:01.345 --> 01:23:10.769]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day, but growing scientific evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.

[01:23:58.985 --> 01:23:59.065]  Yum!
[01:24:15.174 --> 01:24:26.405]  I've got several articles here in front of me that illustrate the corruption we're talking about and that any Bernie Sanders class envy type person who doesn't like crony capitalism should understand.
[01:24:26.405 --> 01:24:27.185]  This is Bloomberg.
[01:24:27.185 --> 01:24:34.933]  I have another one here that Hillary gets 400 to 1 more corporate donations.
[01:24:37.022 --> 01:24:42.605]  400 to 1, corporate donations, big corporate donations that Trump gets.
[01:24:42.605 --> 01:24:43.505]  400 to 1.
[01:24:43.505 --> 01:24:44.886]  Here's an article out of Bloomberg.
[01:24:44.886 --> 01:24:50.169]  Hillary Clinton is out-raising Trump 20 to 1 among millionaires.
[01:24:50.169 --> 01:25:01.074]  And the liberal Bloomberg that wants your guns, he sells this like it's a good idea, like this is something to be proud of.
[01:25:01.074 --> 01:25:02.535]  See, Trump's a loser.
[01:25:03.854 --> 01:25:05.875]  Big corporate money is running from him.
[01:25:05.875 --> 01:25:07.917]  Oh, I thought we didn't like big corporate money.
[01:25:07.917 --> 01:25:09.218]  I thought we wanted it out of politics.
[01:25:09.218 --> 01:25:10.459]  I thought we wanted special interest out.
[01:25:10.459 --> 01:25:14.161]  I thought we wanted foreign interest out.
[01:25:14.161 --> 01:25:15.022]  That is the biggest...
[01:25:17.506 --> 01:25:21.408]  That's a campaign point for him that special interests are running from Donald Trump.
[01:25:21.408 --> 01:25:26.971]  Because they're all about making special deals that cut out their competition and shutting down our economy, but they don't care.
[01:25:26.971 --> 01:25:31.854]  They want to control it and dictate the terms of our economic surrender.
[01:25:31.854 --> 01:25:34.236]  That is the plan!
[01:25:34.236 --> 01:25:39.879]  You don't think they didn't know Obamacare would totally bankrupt our economy further?
[01:25:39.879 --> 01:25:43.981]  And then the central system could dictate who was under it and who wasn't?
[01:25:43.981 --> 01:25:44.862]  It's written open-ended?
[01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:51.012]  Power to tax is power to destroy, and now the Internet's going under UN control.
[01:25:51.012 --> 01:25:52.713]  And the censorship's already beginning.
[01:25:52.713 --> 01:25:56.135]  We're what, two days out now?
[01:25:56.135 --> 01:25:57.256]  People say, where's the censorship?
[01:25:57.256 --> 01:25:58.517]  I don't know, where's Michael Savage?
[01:25:58.517 --> 01:26:00.478]  Where's all these websites getting shut down?
[01:26:00.478 --> 01:26:03.400]  Most people I know are having their Facebook and Twitter shut down just because they promote Trump.
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:08.883]  It's already going on, and it's getting worse incrementally.
[01:26:08.883 --> 01:26:09.303]  But it's okay.
[01:26:10.686 --> 01:26:19.413]  He's evil because the Pope said so, and he also said journalists that promote conspiracy theories, like the fact that Hillary's sick, are terrorists.
[01:26:19.413 --> 01:26:24.156]  He also says he's disgusted by Europe being Christian and not welcoming more Muslims.
[01:26:24.156 --> 01:26:27.178]  I mean, these are quotes, folks, and you're like, is that how a Christian leader said that?
[01:26:27.178 --> 01:26:29.380]  Yeah, he's called the Pope.
[01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:34.464]  Articles with the quotes linked to Catholic newspapers, his statements, on InfoWars.com.
[01:26:35.862 --> 01:26:37.223]  Who's the radicals here?
[01:26:37.223 --> 01:26:44.787]  I've got a stack of videos I haven't even played of white people in Charlotte and other areas being beaten and begging and pleading.
[01:26:44.787 --> 01:26:48.949]  And then the mainstream news says, well, they're white.
[01:26:48.949 --> 01:26:50.330]  They shouldn't have been down there.
[01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:55.313]  Shouldn't have been in a parking garage.
[01:26:55.313 --> 01:27:00.455]  And these are white people saying this because they're suckering everybody.
[01:27:00.455 --> 01:27:01.996]  They think it's so funny.
[01:27:01.996 --> 01:27:04.137]  I want to go out to break one uptown to Errol.
[01:27:04.137 --> 01:27:05.138]  This is the State Department.
[01:27:06.533 --> 01:27:08.675]  Threatens Russia with more body bags.
[01:27:08.675 --> 01:27:10.876]  Attacks on Russian cities.
[01:27:10.876 --> 01:27:15.219]  And this is a veiled threat to Bandar Bush, the Saudi ambassador to the UN, again, a few years ago.
[01:27:15.219 --> 01:27:17.280]  The article's on Infowars.com.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:21.243]  Saudis threaten Russia with Olympic Terrace attacks unless it abandons Syria.
[01:27:21.243 --> 01:27:23.665]  That's a Steve Watson article.
[01:27:23.665 --> 01:27:26.387]  Here is the John Kirby
[01:27:29.105 --> 01:27:36.168]  Our spokesman for the State Department threatens Moscow with terror attacks, but, oh, if you don't let us get the extremists out of Syria, they're going to come and attack you.
[01:27:36.168 --> 01:27:38.550]  Yeah, because you run them and put them there.
[01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:40.270]  And General Flynn and others exposed it.
[01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:43.672]  You've removed Flynn and removed the other generals now.
[01:27:43.672 --> 01:27:46.613]  And our military, to a certain extent, is now aiding ISIS in air raids.
[01:27:46.613 --> 01:27:49.015]  And the military is really upset about it.
[01:27:49.015 --> 01:27:52.596]  And Obama and everybody keeps claiming we're wanting a military coup.
[01:27:52.596 --> 01:27:54.237]  You guys have already couped the country, OK?
[01:27:54.237 --> 01:27:55.658]  It's kind of hard for us to have a coup, OK?
[01:27:58.806 --> 01:28:01.869]  And I'm just looking at the American people asking, do they deserve to be under this?
[01:28:01.869 --> 01:28:15.504]  I mean, if you want to get looted and you want to have $5,000 fines for the free health care, okay, that isn't free, and you want to, you know, arrest the press and, you know, okay, this is what you want, this is what you get.
[01:28:15.504 --> 01:28:19.128]  But let's go out to break with the State Department, start more stuff with Russia.
[01:28:20.188 --> 01:28:27.351]  Extremist groups will continue to exploit the vacuums that are there in Syria.
[01:28:27.351 --> 01:28:27.771]  No question.
[01:28:27.771 --> 01:28:28.912]  Attacks against Russian interests.
[01:28:28.912 --> 01:28:29.672]  Perhaps even Russian cities.
[01:28:29.672 --> 01:28:31.053]  And Russia will continue to
[01:28:43.027 --> 01:28:46.808]  Send troops home in body bags.
[01:28:46.808 --> 01:28:51.730]  Here at the State Department, the Secretary is still committed to a diplomatic solution.
[01:28:51.730 --> 01:28:58.572]  There are other options that don't revolve around the act of diplomacy.
[01:28:58.572 --> 01:29:06.454]  Looking at the events that followed the ceasefire, how is it fair to say that Russia is solely responsible for the failure of this deal?
[01:29:06.454 --> 01:29:09.135]  Because, and we've said this many, many times.
[01:29:09.135 --> 01:29:12.396]  I'm going to come back and play the rest, but just listen to me very carefully, folks.
[01:29:13.777 --> 01:29:17.219]  These are all non-military people, or people that haven't been in a bunch of combat.
[01:29:17.219 --> 01:29:19.840]  I mean, this is just historic.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:27.565]  They've had all these weirdos on Fox News, CNN, you name it, they keep saying, watch out Russia, we'll send you back lots of body bags.
[01:29:27.565 --> 01:29:30.827]  That doesn't make people back off.
[01:29:30.827 --> 01:29:32.227]  It makes people dig in.
[01:29:32.227 --> 01:29:34.649]  That's what I mean, that there's some blind spots with these evil people.
[01:29:36.738 --> 01:29:45.241]  You know, I say non-military, also just psychopaths think this, because Hitler thought bombing British cities and targeting children would make the Brits give up.
[01:29:45.241 --> 01:29:48.862]  It made them go 100% in favor of total destruction of Germany.
[01:29:48.862 --> 01:29:50.623]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[01:29:50.623 --> 01:29:51.663]  I mean, they're crazy.
[01:29:51.663 --> 01:29:55.585]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.585 --> 01:29:58.266]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.412 --> 01:30:06.193]  A CNN headline quotes a wealthy Venezuelan saying, I flew to the U.S.
[01:30:06.193 --> 01:30:08.073]  to buy toilet paper.
[01:30:08.073 --> 01:30:20.116]  Venezuela, where the poor are hunting dogs and cats for food, where the criminals are hunting down and killing police for their guns, and where the communist dictator gave Wall Street 700% return on their investment.
[01:30:20.116 --> 01:30:27.857]  The communists and the banksters have destroyed the country so thoroughly that even the wealthy have to get out of the country if they want to wipe their butts.
[01:30:27.857 --> 01:30:30.718]  A true excrement hits the fan scenario.
[01:30:31.158 --> 01:30:38.065]  The 66-year-old Venezuelan flew to New York and went shopping at Whole Foods, fighting back tears when she saw a fully stocked food shelf.
[01:30:38.065 --> 01:30:42.629]  She said, you are so happy when you find something as basic as milk.
[01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:48.755]  The socialist welfare state and bankster crony capitalism are not just policies and friends of Hugo Chavez.
[01:30:48.755 --> 01:30:51.858]  They're also the policies and friends of Hillary Clinton.
[01:30:51.858 --> 01:30:54.200]  And there's another lesson to learn from this wealthy Venezuelan.
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:59.865]  It doesn't matter how much money you have if there's no food and medicine when these crooks destroy your economy.
[01:30:59.865 --> 01:31:02.248]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:31:02.248 --> 01:31:04.130]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:31:04.130 --> 01:31:06.151]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:31:06.151 --> 01:31:09.054]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:31:09.054 --> 01:31:11.617]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals.
[01:31:11.957 --> 01:31:15.118]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:31:15.118 --> 01:31:24.300]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:31.822]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:31:31.822 --> 01:31:39.865]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:31:39.865 --> 01:31:40.945]  The general public doesn't.
[01:31:42.046 --> 01:31:45.410]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:31:45.410 --> 01:31:49.554]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:31:49.554 --> 01:31:56.261]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:31:56.261 --> 01:32:00.366]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:02.594 --> 01:32:04.556]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[01:32:04.556 --> 01:32:05.877]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:32:05.877 --> 01:32:07.098]  Why is this so good?
[01:32:07.098 --> 01:32:12.383]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:32:12.383 --> 01:32:25.936]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:32:25.936 --> 01:32:27.297]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:32:28.078 --> 01:32:29.700]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:32.283]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:32:32.283 --> 01:32:33.584]  These are all parasites.
[01:32:33.584 --> 01:32:34.686]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:32:34.686 --> 01:32:35.767]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:32:36.041 --> 01:32:40.523]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:32:40.523 --> 01:32:43.805]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:32:43.805 --> 01:32:46.867]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:32:46.867 --> 01:32:47.907]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:32:47.907 --> 01:32:49.848]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:49.848 --> 01:32:50.869]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:32:50.869 --> 01:32:53.570]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:32:53.570 --> 01:32:55.491]  And you support the broadcast.
[01:32:55.491 --> 01:32:56.832]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:56.832 --> 01:32:59.073]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:32:59.073 --> 01:33:01.034]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:33:12.836 --> 01:33:18.523]  He aligns himself with the truth, but it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:18.523 --> 01:33:20.805]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.917 --> 01:33:35.557]  I know we're going to have time to air your whole report.
[01:33:35.557 --> 01:33:36.057]  It's excellent.
[01:33:36.057 --> 01:33:37.038]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:33:37.038 --> 01:33:40.918]  We're going to talk about some of it live here on air.
[01:33:40.918 --> 01:33:44.839]  David Brock of Media Matters has basically been caught laundering money.
[01:33:44.839 --> 01:33:52.440]  You might celebrate the fact that this known anti-American, anti-free press pusher of actually shutting down the free press.
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:53.780]  This is an open authoritarian.
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:34:02.542]  This is a naked, book-burning, knuckle-dragging, pseudo-intellectual, fake leftist cretin.
[01:34:02.542 --> 01:34:02.702]  And I
[01:34:05.026 --> 01:34:10.630]  I mean, he's made it his life's work to destroy myself, the free press, Drudge, Donald Trump.
[01:34:10.630 --> 01:34:13.312]  I don't attack this guy because he just attacks me.
[01:34:13.312 --> 01:34:22.659]  In fact, I don't spend a lot of time on him, but I'm only covering this to show the lawlessness of a Justice Department that will now set the precedent.
[01:34:22.659 --> 01:34:27.843]  You see the arrogance to let Democrats do anything they want, commit any crime.
[01:34:28.871 --> 01:34:34.319]  The FBI Director testified yesterday, we have the clip coming up, that yeah, they never had any intent of indicting anybody.
[01:34:34.319 --> 01:34:41.569]  They were all given immunity up front to give them the immunity, not to rat out somebody above them, but to cover them because they've been doing the cover-ups for Hillary.
[01:34:42.731 --> 01:34:49.592]  So this is basically a type of pardon that the Justice Department and Loretta Lynch... So why not have Clinton meet on Loretta Lynch's airplane?
[01:34:49.592 --> 01:34:54.853]  Why not engage in all these, you know, things that are absolutely violations of ethics and laws?
[01:34:54.853 --> 01:34:56.614]  So we're going to be talking to you here in just a moment.
[01:34:56.614 --> 01:35:03.715]  I want to finish up, though, with this clip from the State Department threatens Russia with more body bags attacks on Russian cities.
[01:35:03.715 --> 01:35:07.496]  This is a refrain that I... or a maxim, they say a lot.
[01:35:09.602 --> 01:35:11.803]  You know, that, oh, you better watch it, we'll kill more Russians.
[01:35:11.803 --> 01:35:22.326]  No, the Russians know in Ukraine, they know in Syria, right on their back door, and they know with 888, what happened in Georgia, that the West is starting these fights.
[01:35:22.326 --> 01:35:24.267]  I mean, we have the emails from Soros.
[01:35:24.267 --> 01:35:27.008]  Hell, he goes on CNN and says he spent billions to do this.
[01:35:27.008 --> 01:35:32.590]  The State Department says they spent $5 billion, and then they spin it and say, oh, you're a Russian agent.
[01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:37.712]  If our government said, let's attack Brazil, I'd say don't do that if Brazil hadn't done anything.
[01:35:39.161 --> 01:35:41.603]  I mean, if they said, attack Antarctica, I'd say, why?
[01:35:41.603 --> 01:35:43.085]  I mean, what did the weather station do to us?
[01:35:43.085 --> 01:35:46.247]  You know, it's like, it's called ethics?
[01:35:46.247 --> 01:35:49.510]  You know, it's called, you're globalists that have occupied my country, you've taken it over.
[01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:52.833]  You can chime in on this if you want in front of this clip, Owen.
[01:35:54.972 --> 01:36:00.838]  It's frustrating to see my face up there next to Trump's, next to Putin's, saying I'm a Russian agent.
[01:36:00.838 --> 01:36:10.408]  That's all over the news and Hillary, you know, in her speech talks about the deplorables and, you know, talks about the dark heart Alex Jones and the Godfather giving him the orders and him and Trump is, is, is, is, is Vladimir Putin.
[01:36:11.288 --> 01:36:14.131]  A lot of sociopaths will say, oh, isn't it great your name's out there, you're real big.
[01:36:14.131 --> 01:36:21.937]  And I'm like, no, it's not hurting me that she's attacking me, that the press goes along with stuff that is 20 times Joseph McCarthy stuff.
[01:36:21.937 --> 01:36:25.741]  I mean, you know, and McCarthy turned out was right.
[01:36:25.741 --> 01:36:30.165]  It's like surreal to really sit there and mourn.
[01:36:30.165 --> 01:36:34.569]  It's a feeling of mourning for the country that we're overrun by foreign banks.
[01:36:36.114 --> 01:36:38.897]  67% of the banker bailouts went to foreign banks and was secret.
[01:36:38.897 --> 01:36:40.378]  They wouldn't tell us who, they'd just say 67%.
[01:36:40.378 --> 01:36:42.280]  You can Google that.
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:43.901]  We've been taken over by multinationals.
[01:36:43.901 --> 01:36:45.683]  They've sold our jobs up.
[01:36:45.683 --> 01:36:48.445]  That's what they admit their plan is.
[01:36:48.445 --> 01:36:53.890]  And then they look at us and say, we're Russian agents.
[01:36:53.890 --> 01:36:56.453]  Because we're against George Soros trying to overthrow our country.
[01:36:56.453 --> 01:36:59.415]  He admittedly tried to overthrow England six times.
[01:36:59.415 --> 01:37:00.997]  He did crash the pound once.
[01:37:02.284 --> 01:37:04.645]  He admits he wants to destroy nation states.
[01:37:04.645 --> 01:37:07.485]  He admits he wants a world government.
[01:37:07.485 --> 01:37:15.488]  The little piece of filth was a Jew that helped sniff out Jews and rob and kill thousands of them.
[01:37:15.488 --> 01:37:25.791]  I mean, the upside down weirdness of this is so diabolical that I don't even have words to describe it at this point.
[01:37:25.791 --> 01:37:27.311]  But these people celebrate
[01:37:29.175 --> 01:37:30.036]  Throwing it in our faces, so.
[01:37:51.977 --> 01:37:54.619]  Okay, he lets me do what I want here.
[01:37:54.619 --> 01:37:57.800]  So not that you need the defense, but honestly, working for you has been amazing.
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:01.002]  You were asking me about it earlier, and it's been honestly amazing.
[01:38:01.002 --> 01:38:02.723]  You've been here a month or so, I haven't really talked to you.
[01:38:02.723 --> 01:38:03.443]  We're all so busy.
[01:38:03.443 --> 01:38:09.127]  I mean, I hire people that I know have their heads screwed on straight, and are promoting liberty, and are Americana, and want to tell the truth.
[01:38:09.867 --> 01:38:13.148]  And we get stuff wrong occasionally, but we really have a passion for integrity and the truth.
[01:38:13.148 --> 01:38:14.129]  It's what we've got.
[01:38:14.129 --> 01:38:16.710]  And the older I get, it's like everything to me.
[01:38:16.710 --> 01:38:22.232]  It's almost neurotic or OCD now that I just, I just, I just want to be a good person.
[01:38:22.232 --> 01:38:23.612]  And these people think that's a weakness.
[01:38:23.612 --> 01:38:24.332]  It's not.
[01:38:24.332 --> 01:38:25.693]  No, that's actually a great point.
[01:38:25.693 --> 01:38:26.013]  It's weird.
[01:38:26.013 --> 01:38:29.034]  It's like trendy now to be a cuck.
[01:38:29.034 --> 01:38:30.275]  Like it's trendy to
[01:38:31.235 --> 01:38:35.759]  Worry about offending somebody and trying to be just an absolute weakling.
[01:38:35.759 --> 01:38:39.081]  And I mean, no offense, but I grew up in St.
[01:38:39.081 --> 01:38:39.461]  Louis.
[01:38:39.461 --> 01:38:44.145]  I can just tell the difference in the society and the culture here in liberal Austin.
[01:38:44.145 --> 01:38:44.906]  I asked, how are you doing?
[01:38:44.906 --> 01:38:46.967]  And you said, man, it's not St.
[01:38:46.967 --> 01:38:47.388]  Louis.
[01:38:47.388 --> 01:38:48.188]  It's wild.
[01:38:48.188 --> 01:38:48.488]  And St.
[01:38:48.488 --> 01:38:51.491]  Louis isn't some like conservative stronghold by any stretch.
[01:38:51.491 --> 01:38:53.072]  It's a pretty conservative city.
[01:38:53.072 --> 01:38:57.535]  But just the difference in the way people behave, the way people approach you.
[01:38:57.535 --> 01:39:00.818]  You understand, this is a colony of failed California.
[01:39:01.118 --> 01:39:02.559]  It's very, it's very strange.
[01:39:02.559 --> 01:39:04.220]  The difference is definitely palpable.
[01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:07.402]  I don't know if there was a clip that you wanted to send it to before we got into David Brock here.
[01:39:07.402 --> 01:39:08.943]  Let's get into Brock, I'll get back to Russia later.
[01:39:08.943 --> 01:39:10.644]  Here's, you know what Alex, this is incredible.
[01:39:10.644 --> 01:39:17.889]  And this shows the bias in the media that you deal with, that Michael Savage deals with, that Drudge deals with, any conservative deals with.
[01:39:17.889 --> 01:39:19.170]  It goes beyond media.
[01:39:19.170 --> 01:39:20.631]  Even if you're a Wall Street executive.
[01:39:20.631 --> 01:39:23.453]  I mean, just a person that's promoting sovereignty, because I don't even call myself a conservative.
[01:39:23.453 --> 01:39:24.474]  In any business.
[01:39:24.474 --> 01:39:26.155]  By the way, let's go back since you mentioned trendies.
[01:39:26.795 --> 01:39:27.756]  They have no culture.
[01:39:27.756 --> 01:39:29.278]  They've been trained to be alone.
[01:39:29.278 --> 01:39:31.360]  They've been trained that there's no family.
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:34.604]  So now, whatever the new trend is, that's their family.
[01:39:34.604 --> 01:39:35.545]  So they're alone.
[01:39:35.545 --> 01:39:36.386]  They're empty.
[01:39:36.386 --> 01:39:37.107]  They're scared.
[01:39:37.107 --> 01:39:39.169]  They don't know what's happening.
[01:39:39.169 --> 01:39:45.777]  And then they're told, your enemy are these people that want to have gardens and guns and tractors and freedom and, you know...
[01:39:46.758 --> 01:39:49.580]  Women think, like, you get ahead henpecking your male.
[01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:56.783]  You know, you get ahead being freaked out, fighting some weird social issue, when all that's happened is you've been turned into a mental patient.
[01:39:56.783 --> 01:39:58.044]  So that's what you're experiencing.
[01:39:58.044 --> 01:39:59.905]  Listen, I went to high school here.
[01:39:59.905 --> 01:40:01.986]  A couple years in Dallas, a couple years here.
[01:40:01.986 --> 01:40:04.047]  Man, my grandparents are from here, my mom's parents.
[01:40:04.047 --> 01:40:05.868]  So I've been down here since I was a kid.
[01:40:05.868 --> 01:40:10.290]  You know, it was 40,000 people when my mom was here, you know, in the 50s and 60s in school.
[01:40:10.290 --> 01:40:11.831]  When I was in high school, 300,000.
[01:40:11.831 --> 01:40:13.012]  So it's a microcosm.
[01:40:13.012 --> 01:40:14.733]  This is a UN city under
[01:40:15.513 --> 01:40:17.814]  Munialization under strong cities initiative.
[01:40:17.814 --> 01:40:22.276]  I mean, the city of Austin takes its orders from the feds and the United Nations.
[01:40:22.276 --> 01:40:27.138]  And it's really a libertarian constitutional area, but they have election fraud since the 70s.
[01:40:27.138 --> 01:40:29.018]  Tarrytown controls everything.
[01:40:29.018 --> 01:40:30.619]  It's even has its own energy supply.
[01:40:30.619 --> 01:40:31.459]  The power goes down.
[01:40:31.459 --> 01:40:33.340]  This is a governing city.
[01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:38.262]  I mean, if you were, you know, like this is one of the capital districts, let's say this is a real capital.
[01:40:38.382 --> 01:40:41.363]  Okay, this is a liberal New World Order, you know, George Soros Capitol.
[01:40:41.363 --> 01:40:44.805]  This is one of the protected zones, COG, whole nine yards.
[01:40:44.805 --> 01:40:48.066]  So this is one reason, I guess, God put us here.
[01:40:48.066 --> 01:40:51.788]  But the point is, this facility is right on the edge of the backup power grid.
[01:40:51.788 --> 01:40:53.388]  If everything else goes down, this is still up.
[01:40:53.388 --> 01:40:57.690]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff that the general public doesn't know that we know, folks, okay?
[01:40:57.690 --> 01:40:59.171]  And, you know, the cops know I know all this.
[01:40:59.171 --> 01:41:00.891]  They think, you must work for an intelligence agency.
[01:41:00.891 --> 01:41:01.672]  That's super secret.
[01:41:01.672 --> 01:41:04.833]  I'm like, no, the stuff's public if you know where to look.
[01:41:04.833 --> 01:41:06.954]  And my point is, this isn't what you think it is, folks.
[01:41:07.754 --> 01:41:12.822]  This fake liberal culture is a camouflage for a military cultural takeover.
[01:41:12.822 --> 01:41:19.051]  These are psychological warfare technicians, and their minions are like the Mao Youth Brigade cut off from reality.
[01:41:19.051 --> 01:41:19.792]  I'm sorry.
[01:41:19.792 --> 01:41:22.516]  Let's get in now to David Brock, who this guy is.
[01:41:23.317 --> 01:41:26.218]  His admissions that he wants to infiltrate and take over and destroy the free media.
[01:41:26.218 --> 01:41:28.399]  The Media Matters says I should be shut down.
[01:41:28.399 --> 01:41:30.200]  They twist and lie about what we say.
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:31.060]  Take it out of context.
[01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:34.302]  They write the talking points for MSNBC, CNN.
[01:41:34.302 --> 01:41:36.503]  Now more and more Fox News is picking him up.
[01:41:36.503 --> 01:41:39.104]  Let's get into who this guy is and his background and what's come out.
[01:41:39.244 --> 01:41:48.230]  Well, and real quick, just to put a bow on what you said, I think that the reason social justice warriors are the way they are is because ultimately they're really just selfish people and that's why they put on this act.
[01:41:48.230 --> 01:41:52.553]  But David Brock, this is amazing Alex, now he actually has a very interesting history.
[01:41:52.553 --> 01:41:54.255]  When he first came up writing books,
[01:41:54.815 --> 01:41:59.316]  He can actually, you can tie him directly to the impeachment of Bill Clinton.
[01:41:59.316 --> 01:42:05.478]  He wrote a book that wound up with Juanita Broderick getting a rape settlement from Bill Clinton.
[01:42:05.478 --> 01:42:06.778]  That's right, he's a mercenary.
[01:42:06.778 --> 01:42:09.959]  And then magically, all of a sudden he's in the Clinton camp.
[01:42:09.959 --> 01:42:11.440]  All of a sudden he's writing books.
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:13.700]  He got a huge book deal, half a million dollars.
[01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:15.421]  Well the same thing happened to Newsmax.
[01:42:16.221 --> 01:42:19.123]  So he gets a huge book deal for half a million dollars, Alex.
[01:42:19.123 --> 01:42:29.111]  Everyone is expecting this book to be slamming the Clintons again, another Clinton hit piece, and then it comes out and he's praising Hillary Clinton.
[01:42:29.111 --> 01:42:37.398]  I was offered a major Hollywood career about 10 years ago that I would just, in the future, when Democrats got in, if I would just play ball.
[01:42:38.268 --> 01:42:40.911]  I mean, you could probably be John Wayne.
[01:42:40.911 --> 01:42:43.935]  John Wayne's like 6'3", 6'4".
[01:42:43.935 --> 01:42:45.216]  I'm like 5'11".
[01:42:45.216 --> 01:42:46.758]  No, seriously, think about that.
[01:42:46.758 --> 01:42:47.519]  I've experienced this.
[01:42:47.519 --> 01:42:50.302]  It's kind of like, you know, play ball, son.
[01:42:50.302 --> 01:42:54.647]  And I'm talking about huge movie stars, huge TV stars.
[01:42:54.647 --> 01:42:55.428]  I'm talking deals.
[01:42:55.828 --> 01:42:58.329]  Well, and let's say that this is what happened to David Brock.
[01:42:58.329 --> 01:43:00.770]  I think it could actually explain a lot of what you're seeing.
[01:43:00.770 --> 01:43:03.651]  Where we have raw evidence.
[01:43:03.651 --> 01:43:05.292]  These are investigative reports.
[01:43:05.292 --> 01:43:06.513]  We've got the documents.
[01:43:06.513 --> 01:43:11.295]  We're going to be interviewing a guy on the Nightly News, Andrew Kerr, who did this independent investigation.
[01:43:11.295 --> 01:43:14.416]  His goal is to get this guy and Media Matters audited.
[01:43:14.416 --> 01:43:15.897]  And we have the documents.
[01:43:15.897 --> 01:43:17.938]  We caught them red-handed.
[01:43:17.938 --> 01:43:22.820]  So perhaps, you know, if you're David Brock, you're sitting around, oh, you write this book,
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:26.301]  Maybe you don't get the response you think you deserve, so you know what?
[01:43:26.301 --> 01:43:27.101]  Screw it!
[01:43:27.101 --> 01:43:28.562]  I'm just going to launder money.
[01:43:28.562 --> 01:43:30.902]  I've got the politicians working with me now.
[01:43:30.902 --> 01:43:32.503]  I know I'm never going to be indicted.
[01:43:32.503 --> 01:43:38.024]  I know I can take hundreds of thousands of dollars out of these campaign contributions, and no one's going to question me.
[01:43:38.024 --> 01:43:39.085]  Well, we are questioning you.
[01:43:39.085 --> 01:43:41.985]  And Dinesh D'Souza gets four friends to give money to a Senate campaign.
[01:43:41.985 --> 01:43:42.766]  He goes to jail.
[01:43:42.766 --> 01:43:43.646]  And there's a bias.
[01:43:43.826 --> 01:43:46.007]  And there's the bias right there, Alex.
[01:43:46.007 --> 01:43:47.248]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:43:47.248 --> 01:43:51.710]  A little tiny donation to Nestor Sousa makes, you know, a couple thousand dollars.
[01:43:51.710 --> 01:43:54.651]  It was much more legal than what David Brock is doing.
[01:43:54.651 --> 01:43:55.832]  I guarantee you that.
[01:43:55.832 --> 01:43:57.873]  Now he just didn't fill out the PAC form.
[01:43:57.873 --> 01:44:00.634]  Let's explain what Brock does, because it's just like the Clinton Foundation.
[01:44:00.634 --> 01:44:01.495]  So here's what we...
[01:44:02.695 --> 01:44:07.177]  This is what we have him caught red-handed doing, folks.
[01:44:07.177 --> 01:44:12.059]  He's been working with the Bonner Group.
[01:44:12.059 --> 01:44:21.263]  Now every time... David Brock manages about 10 PACs that receive millions and millions of dollars in campaign contributions.
[01:44:21.263 --> 01:44:25.644]  Now what happens with this money is it gets filtered.
[01:44:25.644 --> 01:44:26.925]  Maybe I've got the flowchart here.
[01:44:27.185 --> 01:44:30.188]  You can also roll some of his report, hasn't it?
[01:44:30.188 --> 01:44:35.512]  It basically gets filtered through all of David Brock's different super PACs.
[01:44:35.512 --> 01:44:42.559]  Now, there is a middleman in almost every one of these money transfers, and that is the Bonner Group.
[01:44:42.559 --> 01:44:44.761]  The Bonner Group takes 12.5% of every money transfer.
[01:44:48.564 --> 01:44:52.047]  So that's the lobbying legal management team.
[01:44:52.047 --> 01:44:54.749]  And he keeps them unregistered!
[01:44:54.749 --> 01:45:02.795]  He keeps them unregistered so he doesn't have to report who is actually... And last time I heard, that violates the Federal Elections Commission laws.
[01:45:02.795 --> 01:45:10.361]  And that is what Andrew Kerr talks about, is he could not find anything that he's doing to make this legal.
[01:45:10.361 --> 01:45:11.381]  And this is the same guy
[01:45:12.242 --> 01:45:20.679]  That has put out a huge reward, I think it's a million bucks, for, if we can pull it up, for dirt on Trump.
[01:45:21.875 --> 01:45:30.922]  And he said, when asked why is this such a high percentage of the money going to the Bonner Group, he says, this is what we do to motivate people to raise money.
[01:45:30.922 --> 01:45:38.688]  So, right on their face they're saying, we don't really care about the cause, we don't really care about the political agenda, we just want to make money!
[01:45:38.688 --> 01:45:40.089]  I'm here to make money, baby!
[01:45:40.089 --> 01:45:44.492]  I'm making 12.5% of every campaign donation you make!
[01:45:44.492 --> 01:45:45.413]  I want to make money!
[01:45:45.413 --> 01:45:46.654]  That's what David Brock's about.
[01:45:46.654 --> 01:45:48.195]  This guy is a total fraud.
[01:45:48.195 --> 01:45:49.636]  But it's okay because he's a liberal.
[01:45:49.636 --> 01:45:50.617]  Just like the Clintons.
[01:45:51.337 --> 01:45:56.946]  gave 5.7% of the Haitian money to the charity, period!
[01:45:56.946 --> 01:46:00.271]  I mean, the only person worse is Bono, that gave 1.8%.
[01:46:00.271 --> 01:46:03.956]  And then Bono... I mean, my God, can you imagine if we took money...
[01:46:04.756 --> 01:46:14.466]  I mean, I guarantee you, if we took money for Haitian kids or anybody else, we would pay the credit card fees, the transfer fees, and the price of the secretaries or accountants, and then I would take zero.
[01:46:14.466 --> 01:46:17.089]  I mean, you'd get 95% of the Haitian kids.
[01:46:17.089 --> 01:46:17.990]  And probably more.
[01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:20.593]  I mean, that is so sick!
[01:46:20.593 --> 01:46:21.574]  Just like Obamacare.
[01:46:23.001 --> 01:46:25.083]  There's no penalty, though, everybody's getting hit with it.
[01:46:25.083 --> 01:46:28.026]  I mean, the way they lie to us, it's crazy.
[01:46:28.026 --> 01:46:48.425]  And so get this, now David Brock founded the Correct the Record initiative, which is paying people millions of dollars to go online and be trolls who want to find things that are said about Hillary Clinton and then try to divert it or say it's a lie or, you know, make up... Oh, that's just like Lester Holt.
[01:46:48.985 --> 01:46:50.787]  Trump's like, no, I was always against the Iraq War, 2003.
[01:46:50.787 --> 01:46:54.992]  And Holt, earpiece, you can tell he goes, no you're not, not true, not true.
[01:46:54.992 --> 01:46:58.175]  Doesn't matter, we have three clips of him saying it on Fox and CNN.
[01:46:58.175 --> 01:47:03.942]  But he said it on Howard Stern, and he even admits, he's like, look, I was on Howard Stern, it's an entertainment show.
[01:47:03.942 --> 01:47:06.765]  That's what Trump does, because they're all talking over him.
[01:47:06.765 --> 01:47:08.867]  He's like, oh yeah, sure, whatever, let's move off Iraq, talk about my hotel.
[01:47:09.568 --> 01:47:19.262]  So, but on the record, when the war was about to happen, when they'd come after you if you were against it, because I remember they came after me and called me a communist and an al-Qaeda agent and all this crap, now I'm a Russian agent supposedly.
[01:47:21.727 --> 01:47:24.710]  And when it really counted, Trump was right.
[01:47:24.710 --> 01:47:24.990]  Boom.
[01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:25.550]  And this is it.
[01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:26.571]  This is huge right here.
[01:47:26.571 --> 01:47:28.733]  This document that we have up.
[01:47:28.733 --> 01:47:30.914]  American Bridge 21st Century.
[01:47:30.914 --> 01:47:33.236]  That's a David Brock PAC.
[01:47:33.236 --> 01:47:34.237]  Franklin Forum.
[01:47:34.237 --> 01:47:35.718]  That's a David Brock PAC.
[01:47:35.718 --> 01:47:36.519]  Bonner Group.
[01:47:36.519 --> 01:47:39.601]  That is run by David Brock's friend, Mary Bonner.
[01:47:39.601 --> 01:47:40.742]  We caught them!
[01:47:40.742 --> 01:47:41.723]  This is collusion!
[01:47:41.723 --> 01:47:45.266]  This is the Jordan Belfort of campaign contributions.
[01:47:45.266 --> 01:47:45.866]  Let's explain.
[01:47:45.866 --> 01:47:48.949]  They're taking their own PACs and then running it through their own management company.
[01:47:49.349 --> 01:47:53.533]  So, and then, on the back end, David Brock founded Correct the Record.
[01:47:53.533 --> 01:47:55.155]  It's now run by Elizabeth Cohen.
[01:47:55.155 --> 01:47:56.456]  Okay, so what does Correct the Record do?
[01:47:56.456 --> 01:47:57.917]  They engage in the info war.
[01:47:57.917 --> 01:48:00.559]  They have to pay their little minions.
[01:48:00.559 --> 01:48:08.627]  They have to give their little minions a little handout to go online, tough guys getting behind their keyboard and standing up for Hillary Clinton.
[01:48:08.627 --> 01:48:13.051]  That's how pathetic their side of these... And by the way, we don't even have... We should do a report on this.
[01:48:13.051 --> 01:48:13.772]  We've done it a few times.
[01:48:13.772 --> 01:48:14.893]  We can go look at the IP addresses.
[01:48:15.293 --> 01:48:23.036]  And they'll be like ten people commenting, and it's a bot now, where a person's loading the bot, but it's spamming the site, and it'll be like, I was in L.A.
[01:48:23.036 --> 01:48:24.597]  this weekend and Alex was drunk in an alleyway.
[01:48:24.597 --> 01:48:26.118]  I haven't been in an alley in two years.
[01:48:26.118 --> 01:48:37.582]  Or I had, you know, gay sex with Alex Jones in an alley, you know, and this is the stuff they're just, and I'm like, big, say whatever you want, isn't true, you know, Alex Jones raped me, whatever, but this is what they're doing.
[01:48:37.582 --> 01:48:43.465]  We can go see, these are bots, these are coming from think tanks, these are coming from PR firms, probably coming from, you know,
[01:48:44.185 --> 01:48:52.789]  The Democratic version of Turd Blossom, David Brock, because, you know, let's be fair here, we got Karl Rove also, with all his PACs and stuff, should be looked at.
[01:48:52.789 --> 01:48:57.091]  It's simply amazing, but this guy came out in Politico, was it four or five years ago?
[01:48:57.091 --> 01:49:03.114]  I think the headline was, Media Matters Memo Leaked.
[01:49:03.114 --> 01:49:09.037]  But they say how good it is, and it says, we're going to infiltrate alternative media and Fox News and take it down.
[01:49:10.279 --> 01:49:11.681]  I may even have that story somewhere.
[01:49:11.681 --> 01:49:13.302]  That's called torturous interference.
[01:49:13.302 --> 01:49:14.103]  They can pull it up.
[01:49:14.103 --> 01:49:14.724]  They can pull it up.
[01:49:14.724 --> 01:49:17.967]  Just type in Media Matters Memo Politico.
[01:49:17.967 --> 01:49:22.312]  Lou Dobbs and Don Imus were both victims of Media Matters.
[01:49:22.312 --> 01:49:26.156]  And what he does is he works with the same people, the NAACP.
[01:49:26.156 --> 01:49:27.197]  He works with Al Sharpton.
[01:49:27.737 --> 01:49:36.419]  And he claims racism, or he uses leverage in Hispanic markets to threaten Ford advertisers to try to get Lou Dobbs pulled off the air.
[01:49:36.419 --> 01:49:41.360]  So we got Imus pulled off the air claiming racism, and then we got Dobbs pulled off the air playing the race card.
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:52.963]  Listen, I was told in confidence by a local affiliate that I've been on for a decade, but because it's confidence I can't say who did it, but this is going on all over the country where they'll show up and they won't just threaten to pull sponsors.
[01:49:52.963 --> 01:49:53.983]  You know what they're doing to get us off?
[01:49:55.367 --> 01:49:57.368]  Well, they're just going to make a law to get you off the air.
[01:49:57.368 --> 01:50:10.572]  No, they'll approach the station, let's say we're number one during the day, and they'll say, we want to pay for a sponsored show with this local doctor, who's never been on a talk show with us, we're going to pay you $500,000 a quarter.
[01:50:10.572 --> 01:50:20.035]  Another one, a smaller station, $200,000 for the first six months, and they are pulling, not just my show, all the local Libertarian Patriot shows.
[01:50:20.035 --> 01:50:22.576]  They're taking top-rated people that have been on the air 20 years.
[01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:26.951]  Just my experience working in the St.
[01:50:26.951 --> 01:50:34.072]  Louis radio market, I can tell you, I've worked for show hosts who got pulled off the air because they talked about Obama.
[01:50:34.072 --> 01:50:39.514]  I have worked for show hosts who... Oh, I had them come in and tell me, we got a call, we don't know what you're up to.
[01:50:39.514 --> 01:50:42.995]  They sent, they sent the... I'm going to skip this, we're on break.
[01:50:42.995 --> 01:50:45.516]  We may not even be here soon if this continues.
[01:50:45.516 --> 01:50:46.476]  This is how serious this is.
[01:50:47.356 --> 01:50:52.848]  Shamrock Communications, which owned like, I don't know, a hundred and something newspapers, TV stations, radio stations, a couple hundred of those at the time.
[01:50:52.848 --> 01:50:54.451]  I've never seen the owners of any of it.
[01:50:54.451 --> 01:50:55.273]  They show up!
[01:50:56.338 --> 01:51:02.865]  The head CEO shows up and wants to meet with me and calls me into this boardroom and says, what the hell are you doing?
[01:51:02.865 --> 01:51:04.486]  I've gotten a call from the White House.
[01:51:04.486 --> 01:51:08.610]  You are, you are, you know, and of course this was, you know, the Clintons at the time.
[01:51:08.610 --> 01:51:10.872]  You are not going to talk about the Clintons anymore.
[01:51:10.872 --> 01:51:11.893]  And I didn't even click at the time.
[01:51:11.893 --> 01:51:14.796]  I wasn't, and he goes, you're not gonna talk about Governor Bush either.
[01:51:14.796 --> 01:51:15.577]  What's this business?
[01:51:15.577 --> 01:51:17.239]  You went over there and got arrested asking him a question.
[01:51:17.239 --> 01:51:18.220]  I was like, Bush?
[01:51:19.181 --> 01:51:21.162]  Because it's all the same group.
[01:51:21.162 --> 01:51:22.724]  It was all stage.
[01:51:22.724 --> 01:51:26.268]  I'm like, but listen, I'm bringing in all this money.
[01:51:26.268 --> 01:51:30.632]  I'm like, the top ratings on the station, they were paying to have Howard Stern on at the time.
[01:51:30.632 --> 01:51:32.133]  I was there as a, I was smart.
[01:51:32.133 --> 01:51:33.174]  I wasn't just a host, I was a salesman.
[01:51:34.042 --> 01:51:41.544]  So I went and sold, you know, years before I got a Saturday show, sold a bunch of advertisers, got good ratings, they put me on the weeknights, sold more.
[01:51:41.544 --> 01:51:48.026]  I was making, you know, at like 25 years old, I was making like $200,000 a year just on ad sales.
[01:51:48.026 --> 01:51:51.067]  I was bankrolling, getting cameras, films, crew, building an operation.
[01:51:51.067 --> 01:51:53.688]  That was a lot of money when I was 25, $300,000 a year.
[01:51:53.688 --> 01:51:55.408]  And look at what you've built.
[01:51:55.408 --> 01:51:56.869]  The point is they got more and more pissed.
[01:51:57.861 --> 01:51:58.902]  And they were like, what are you doing?
[01:51:58.902 --> 01:52:01.484]  And I guess it was because I was putting the show out on shortwave.
[01:52:01.484 --> 01:52:02.665]  It was getting huge ratings there.
[01:52:02.665 --> 01:52:04.747]  It was getting copied all over the country.
[01:52:04.747 --> 01:52:07.670]  My films were being handed out on VHS at military bases.
[01:52:07.670 --> 01:52:10.752]  I didn't realize it was super viral in the government.
[01:52:10.752 --> 01:52:12.574]  And they said, listen, we're going to pay you more.
[01:52:12.574 --> 01:52:14.215]  We're going to put you on the sports show.
[01:52:14.215 --> 01:52:15.516]  You're going to do entertainment.
[01:52:15.516 --> 01:52:18.099]  You're a really talented guy and it's fine.
[01:52:18.099 --> 01:52:18.819]  You make a lot of money.
[01:52:18.819 --> 01:52:23.123]  You've got a few weeks to phase it out and you're not going to be political anymore.
[01:52:23.123 --> 01:52:23.944]  And I'm sitting there.
[01:52:25.353 --> 01:52:31.116]  And the guy, big fat guy, he said to me, he went, I know you just want to make money and be successful, pretty boy.
[01:52:31.116 --> 01:52:33.397]  And then six weeks later, they call me in.
[01:52:33.397 --> 01:52:34.598]  The BBC was there to interview me.
[01:52:36.169 --> 01:52:39.872]  And this was the local manager and he came in and he said, come here and get your crap out of here.
[01:52:39.872 --> 01:52:41.132]  He smiled, little mustache.
[01:52:41.132 --> 01:52:43.174]  He goes, you get your crap out of here, loser.
[01:52:43.174 --> 01:52:44.254]  You're never going to be in the media again.
[01:52:44.254 --> 01:52:45.315]  He started laughing at me.
[01:52:45.315 --> 01:52:46.736]  I said, well, let me get my microphone.
[01:52:46.736 --> 01:52:47.296]  They were so cheap.
[01:52:47.296 --> 01:52:51.279]  I had a lot of my own equipment, you know, back to the back for voiceovers and stuff, my own DAP recorder and stuff.
[01:52:51.279 --> 01:52:53.280]  And I said, and I knew I'd already started the show.
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:55.782]  I was already bigger, you know, doing the show out of my house.
[01:52:55.782 --> 01:52:58.003]  And I was just like, wow, what cruddy people.
[01:52:58.003 --> 01:53:00.885]  Because the old folks that had hired me that were Patriots, they'd moved on to run other stuff.
[01:53:01.605 --> 01:53:09.692]  And it was just the way that they were guilty for being evil, but they got off because they knew this was coming from the White House.
[01:53:09.692 --> 01:53:10.073]  Okay?
[01:53:10.073 --> 01:53:19.041]  And so it was the pleasure of smashing an American, crushing an American, crushing someone they knew was good-looking and talented and success because he was nothing but a big fat loser.
[01:53:19.041 --> 01:53:20.422]  And that's it right there.
[01:53:20.422 --> 01:53:22.384]  And all of them got fired six months later.
[01:53:23.024 --> 01:53:24.066]  They hate alpha males.
[01:53:24.066 --> 01:53:28.092]  I don't know why, but the trendy liberals cannot stand an alpha male.
[01:53:28.092 --> 01:53:34.621]  I guess that's because we're going to come and we're going to take their fake reign of truly of political terror on this country.
[01:53:34.621 --> 01:53:37.566]  But Alex, everywhere I go, people tell me to say that they love you.
[01:53:37.566 --> 01:53:38.868]  Real alpha males want prosperity!
[01:53:38.988 --> 01:53:39.829]  We don't want to piss on people.
[01:53:39.829 --> 01:53:41.292]  That's what I'm saying because look what you've done.
[01:53:41.292 --> 01:53:43.455]  You just talked about how you built this.
[01:53:43.455 --> 01:53:48.524]  You were funneling your profits back into this operation and now you've built this and you're effecting change.
[01:53:48.524 --> 01:53:52.250]  You're starting brush fires of liberty in the hearts of millions of people around this country.
[01:53:53.874 --> 01:53:55.254]  You don't see liberals doing this.
[01:53:55.254 --> 01:53:56.094]  What do they do?
[01:53:56.094 --> 01:53:59.475]  They make super PACs to steal your money!
[01:53:59.475 --> 01:54:00.695]  That's what liberals do!
[01:54:00.695 --> 01:54:04.516]  They pass Obamacare with foreign corporations to gang-rape you and your family.
[01:54:04.516 --> 01:54:07.557]  And then sit on TV laughing how dumb you are.
[01:54:07.557 --> 01:54:10.698]  And you know Alex, I think... And they're all against Donald Trump.
[01:54:10.698 --> 01:54:15.679]  They're all scared to death because, folks, they know he isn't out to screw you.
[01:54:15.679 --> 01:54:17.679]  Because, by the way, he doesn't like being screwed.
[01:54:17.679 --> 01:54:19.280]  And he sees the globalist people.
[01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:21.120]  He's like, there was this sweet architect.
[01:54:22.415 --> 01:54:30.818]  And you know, and I went and looked at that Architect case, it's her main ad, she runs on TV and the web, and this guy kept expanding what he claimed it was going to cost.
[01:54:30.818 --> 01:54:33.199]  And Trump said, no way, I'm going with the original contract.
[01:54:33.199 --> 01:54:35.040]  Oh, he's stuck with his guns.
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:37.821]  He didn't launch wars and kill hundreds of thousands of Christians.
[01:54:37.821 --> 01:54:40.342]  He didn't go and destabilize Africa and Libya.
[01:54:40.342 --> 01:54:42.123]  He didn't engage in all these other crimes.
[01:54:42.123 --> 01:54:43.483]  He didn't pass Obamacare.
[01:54:43.483 --> 01:54:44.924]  He didn't repeal Glass-Steagall.
[01:54:44.924 --> 01:54:47.865]  He didn't, you know, create the derivatives thing like the Clintons did.
[01:54:47.865 --> 01:54:48.906]  He didn't engage in all this.
[01:54:48.906 --> 01:54:50.346]  He didn't bomb Belgrade.
[01:54:50.346 --> 01:54:50.566]  No!
[01:54:52.287 --> 01:54:56.508]  I mean, architects are famous for trying to, like, get you in and jack prices up.
[01:54:56.508 --> 01:54:59.189]  I mean, my God, they're terrible, I'll tell you point blank.
[01:54:59.189 --> 01:55:00.329]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:55:00.329 --> 01:55:05.851]  So, my family's dealt with this, and so Trump isn't going to get screwed over, and that's why they're scared.
[01:55:05.851 --> 01:55:08.252]  He's got a big you-know-what for them.
[01:55:08.252 --> 01:55:13.133]  He wants to see America dominate, because these same elites have always been screwing with him.
[01:55:13.133 --> 01:55:14.254]  He's always beaten them.
[01:55:15.134 --> 01:55:20.479]  And this is about Trump wanting to take on the big Goliath because he's an alpha male.
[01:55:20.479 --> 01:55:23.301]  And an alpha male wants prosperity for the tribe.
[01:55:23.301 --> 01:55:26.644]  And he sees the American people as the tribe and he wants to create real unity.
[01:55:26.644 --> 01:55:27.244]  Go ahead.
[01:55:27.244 --> 01:55:34.970]  Well, and I think what just happened with Michael Savage illustrates something that a lot of people... That's being taken off Monday nationwide and no one will even talk about it here.
[01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:38.033]  I couldn't, I can't believe that the lack of coverage that's going on with this.
[01:55:38.033 --> 01:55:38.934]  But who should be surprised?
[01:55:38.934 --> 01:55:40.175]  They won't even investigate David Brock.
[01:55:40.535 --> 01:55:51.004]  But I think that this can be kind of a Rosetta Stone for people, where Michael Savage says something negative about Hillary Clinton and then, you know, a glitch happens or he gets preempted, whatever it is.
[01:55:51.004 --> 01:55:53.747]  But the Rosetta Stone here to me, Alex, is... It never comes back on.
[01:55:53.747 --> 01:56:02.375]  It's the fact that all it took was one syndicate, it took one satellite, it took one station to pull that plug and he was off.
[01:56:02.995 --> 01:56:06.817]  Half of the network she was on, because this is the centralized control.
[01:56:06.817 --> 01:56:08.058]  And I'm not demonizing Savage.
[01:56:08.058 --> 01:56:10.980]  This is just how the radio works when you have a syndicated show like that.
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:14.562]  There's one hub that usually sends out the feed to all these affiliates.
[01:56:14.562 --> 01:56:15.623]  That's just how it works.
[01:56:15.623 --> 01:56:18.284]  But this is how the centralized power structure works.
[01:56:18.284 --> 01:56:28.931]  This can be an illustration to all the Americans out there who don't understand how the centralized power grid works, where it can be Michael Savage, it could be Alex Jones, it could be you, it could be anything.
[01:56:28.931 --> 01:56:29.671]  It doesn't matter.
[01:56:31.559 --> 01:56:32.440]  Station.
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:33.760]  One major satellite.
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:37.143]  Whether it be any of the six major operations that run the world.
[01:56:37.143 --> 01:56:37.883]  There's an internet kill switch.
[01:56:37.883 --> 01:56:44.367]  We told people about the internet kill switch in 2009 because it was actually in the Federal Communications Commission documents.
[01:56:44.367 --> 01:56:44.947]  It was coming out.
[01:56:44.947 --> 01:56:45.908]  It wasn't called that.
[01:56:45.908 --> 01:56:46.769]  We called it that.
[01:56:46.769 --> 01:56:47.549]  They said, oh, you're crazy.
[01:56:47.549 --> 01:56:49.110]  It doesn't exist.
[01:56:49.110 --> 01:56:51.452]  It was the technicians calling it a kill switch.
[01:56:51.452 --> 01:56:53.433]  And by the way, they don't just shut the web off.
[01:56:53.433 --> 01:56:56.675]  They turned it into like a cable station where they only send you what they want.
[01:56:56.675 --> 01:56:59.397]  And the new George Soros emails, four weeks old.
[01:56:59.397 --> 01:56:59.797]  Google it.
[01:57:01.149 --> 01:57:07.895]  New Soros emails say they want to send the news to their platforms and block their opposition.
[01:57:07.895 --> 01:57:08.376]  Boom!
[01:57:08.376 --> 01:57:09.657]  It's in there.
[01:57:09.657 --> 01:57:10.658]  He's already working.
[01:57:10.658 --> 01:57:13.721]  He said, we need to transfer this ICAN agreement to the UN.
[01:57:13.721 --> 01:57:14.742]  It's happening in two days.
[01:57:14.742 --> 01:57:15.322]  And so what happened?
[01:57:15.322 --> 01:57:17.685]  Three-year-old emails that came out a month ago.
[01:57:17.685 --> 01:57:18.345]  So what happens?
[01:57:18.345 --> 01:57:20.748]  They silence the opposition and just like in 1984, we don't exist.
[01:57:22.409 --> 01:57:23.369]  That's what they claim.
[01:57:23.369 --> 01:57:24.870]  And then people say, well it's not a U.N.
[01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:26.851]  takeover, it's a global takeover, whatever.
[01:57:26.851 --> 01:57:28.272]  They create their leftist U.N.
[01:57:28.272 --> 01:57:34.274]  as the new enforcement body that the left all sees as the mothership landing to save them, and then it's in the Washington Post that the U.N.'
[01:57:34.254 --> 01:57:36.615]  's coming, it's going to give black people reparations.
[01:57:36.615 --> 01:57:42.838]  A foreign global government body stirring up insurrection domestically with a weirdo Nazi collaborator.
[01:57:42.838 --> 01:57:44.338]  You can't make this up.
[01:57:44.338 --> 01:57:46.139]  It's beyond a James Bond movie.
[01:57:46.139 --> 01:57:47.860]  And then they're running around saying, kill the cops!
[01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:49.861]  The UN will save us from everything, Alex.
[01:57:49.861 --> 01:57:54.843]  They'll save us from racism, they'll save us from the big banks, they'll save us from the fluoride in the water.
[01:57:54.843 --> 01:57:58.405]  I think the UN, you know what, I think the UN is going to save all the problems.
[01:57:58.405 --> 01:57:59.505]  Why do we even do this show?
[01:57:59.505 --> 01:58:00.146]  It's the UN!
[01:58:00.146 --> 01:58:00.386]  The UN!
[01:58:00.386 --> 01:58:00.826]  That's right.
[01:58:00.826 --> 01:58:05.488]  Well listen folks, they want to shut down the economy and have a top-down economy where you can only buy from them.
[01:58:05.488 --> 01:58:13.492]  Go to farmers markets, buy local, go to swap meets, don't shop with the big global corporate people, support local independent media, support this operation.
[01:58:13.492 --> 01:58:16.493]  We can leverage this and defeat them, the Clinton's own internal documents that can
[01:58:16.493 --> 01:58:17.133]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:52.347 --> 01:58:58.890]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:58:58.890 --> 01:59:02.111]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:59:02.111 --> 01:59:07.693]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:59:07.693 --> 01:59:13.815]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:59:13.815 --> 01:59:17.096]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:59:17.096 --> 01:59:18.537]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:59:18.757 --> 01:59:23.059]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:59:23.059 --> 01:59:26.000]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.661]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:59:27.661 --> 01:59:31.103]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:59:31.103 --> 01:59:33.704]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:59:33.704 --> 01:59:34.764]  It's in powder form.
[01:59:34.764 --> 01:59:37.646]  We have so many five-star reviews.

[02:00:47.852 --> 02:00:49.852]  Owen Troyer is our guest for another five minutes.
[02:00:49.852 --> 02:00:51.833]  Dr. Pachinick is popping in to cover the waterfront.
[02:00:55.798 --> 02:00:59.681]  We are discussing the state of the world today and what's happening and what's unfolding.
[02:00:59.681 --> 02:01:13.250]  I mean, look at the Pope coming out in a newspaper interview saying that journalists that engage in conspiracy theories, that means being a journalist, actually questioning government liars, are quote terrorists and should be silenced.
[02:01:13.250 --> 02:01:14.771]  Well, there's no conspiracies going on.
[02:01:14.771 --> 02:01:20.035]  I mean, this Pope might as well just say, you know, I love Mao Zedong.
[02:01:20.035 --> 02:01:20.776]  I mean, this is what...
[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:23.441]  How much crazier is this?
[02:01:23.441 --> 02:01:25.102]  I mean, this guy can come out and say, Hail Satan!
[02:01:25.102 --> 02:01:26.463]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[02:01:26.463 --> 02:01:28.764]  Okay, call me a conspiracy theorist, whatever.
[02:01:28.764 --> 02:01:31.566]  Are you saying there's no conspiracies going on?
[02:01:31.566 --> 02:01:34.408]  Or are you saying that I don't have any facts to back up my theories?
[02:01:34.408 --> 02:01:34.868]  I don't understand.
[02:01:34.868 --> 02:01:36.029]  What are your theories?
[02:01:36.029 --> 02:01:40.272]  You know, are you... How can you not see there's conspiracies going on?
[02:01:40.272 --> 02:01:42.253]  Look at what's happening to our economy.
[02:01:42.253 --> 02:01:43.774]  Look at what's happening with wars.
[02:01:43.774 --> 02:01:46.236]  Look what's happening on the streets of America now.
[02:01:46.556 --> 02:01:47.617]  Look what's happening in our government.
[02:01:47.617 --> 02:01:49.018]  People will admit the government's corrupt.
[02:01:49.018 --> 02:01:50.398]  People will admit the media's corrupt.
[02:01:50.398 --> 02:01:56.942]  But then when conspiracy theorists try to point out why, well, they discount everything we say and the Pope says that, you know, we just don't exist.
[02:01:56.942 --> 02:01:57.603]  Like, for example...
[02:01:58.459 --> 02:02:10.971]  People would probably say, oh, it's a conspiracy theory that David Brock had to pay out $850,000 because he was blackmailed by his ex-boyfriend to be, he was going to file a report with the IRS.
[02:02:10.971 --> 02:02:11.831]  David Brock pays him $850,000.
[02:02:11.831 --> 02:02:14.294]  This is a story on Heat Street.
[02:02:14.294 --> 02:02:15.335]  It's all over the internet.
[02:02:15.335 --> 02:02:17.356]  I've got the actual court documents right here.
[02:02:17.356 --> 02:02:19.779]  Superior Court of the District of Columbia, Civil Action Number 2011.
[02:02:22.695 --> 02:02:26.602]  $850,000, David Rock paid it out to his ex-boyfriend, William Ray.
[02:02:26.602 --> 02:02:28.846]  But the controlled media said it didn't exist.
[02:02:28.846 --> 02:02:33.473]  Well, right, because they didn't cover it, and they'll shut you off, or they'll shut Chef Savage off, whoever it is.
[02:02:33.473 --> 02:02:35.156]  It shows these are evil people.
[02:02:35.156 --> 02:02:35.336]  I mean...
[02:02:37.808 --> 02:02:38.569]  It's the last few years.
[02:02:38.569 --> 02:02:40.529]  There's a new level of lying.
[02:02:40.529 --> 02:02:45.211]  And I don't know if they've gotten more corrupt or they've been let off the leash, but don't they know it's discrediting themselves?
[02:02:45.211 --> 02:02:46.532]  And I think they do.
[02:02:46.532 --> 02:02:49.573]  They're just getting prepared for the time we're shut down.
[02:02:49.573 --> 02:02:51.874]  You know, that's an excellent point.
[02:02:51.874 --> 02:02:54.215]  Do the liberals see that they're losing the battle?
[02:02:54.955 --> 02:03:07.360]  They pay millions of dollars out, correct the record, to send people onto the internet and go and engage in political discourse against people that don't like Hillary Clinton, and they're still losing.
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:08.981]  And Hillary can't even get crowds.
[02:03:08.981 --> 02:03:10.021]  I mean, the Democrats don't like her.
[02:03:10.021 --> 02:03:10.401]  Nothing.
[02:03:10.401 --> 02:03:11.342]  There's no crowd.
[02:03:11.342 --> 02:03:17.064]  She's sent undercover people into her campaign headquarters in different states, Millie Weaver and others, and they're just like, gosh, no one likes her.
[02:03:17.064 --> 02:03:18.425]  All the Democrats I know are voting for her.
[02:03:18.425 --> 02:03:19.065]  I don't like her either.
[02:03:19.565 --> 02:03:22.026]  It's like there's no one there.
[02:03:22.026 --> 02:03:24.368]  Bernie Sanders was like 70 points ahead of her.
[02:03:24.368 --> 02:03:29.851]  There were more supporters of Gary Johnson and Jill Stein in New York on the streets than there were Hillary Clinton.
[02:03:29.851 --> 02:03:32.192]  By the way, I told you something's wrong with Johnson.
[02:03:32.192 --> 02:03:38.776]  I don't know if he's got neurological disintegration or something, but he acted like a mental patient when he was here a few years ago.
[02:03:38.776 --> 02:03:39.616]  I've known the guy for a while.
[02:03:39.616 --> 02:03:40.857]  He's different now.
[02:03:40.857 --> 02:03:42.378]  His head was in a microwave oven.
[02:03:42.378 --> 02:03:44.299]  I didn't see the same thing.
[02:03:44.299 --> 02:03:47.641]  But now he went on TV and they go, who's your favorite foreign president?
[02:03:48.041 --> 02:03:48.901]  He doesn't even know.
[02:03:48.901 --> 02:03:51.822]  And he just goes, I, I, uh, Mexico, uh, uh, uh.
[02:03:51.822 --> 02:03:53.663]  What, is it Aleppo?
[02:03:53.663 --> 02:03:55.364]  He goes, this is like Aleppo again.
[02:03:55.364 --> 02:03:56.744]  He should have said Barack Obama.
[02:03:56.744 --> 02:03:58.385]  I mean, he's basically a foreign dictator.
[02:03:58.385 --> 02:03:58.965]  He's not the U.S.
[02:03:58.965 --> 02:03:59.245]  President.
[02:03:59.245 --> 02:04:04.147]  I mean, he could have said something like, you know, I like Margaret Thatcher, or he couldn't, no, it's worse.
[02:04:04.147 --> 02:04:06.127]  He could have, he could think of presidents.
[02:04:06.127 --> 02:04:13.590]  He's so robotic and trying to be so political and thinks he's so smart that he wanted to pick the perfect one that was milquetoast so it wouldn't make anybody mad.
[02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:17.451]  Again, we're not trying to be politicians and say what you want to hear.
[02:04:17.451 --> 02:04:20.451]  We're trying to overthrow the corrupt globalist takeover.
[02:04:20.451 --> 02:04:24.812]  We want to overthrow it and take the blinders off so we can all just make real decisions.
[02:04:24.812 --> 02:04:27.853]  See, we're not trying to, you know, oh, he was smart.
[02:04:27.853 --> 02:04:34.615]  It's like Karl Rove when I saw him and confronted him at the RNC airport as he was flying out of Dallas to Cleveland.
[02:04:34.615 --> 02:04:37.635]  He's like, Alex, you don't follow the rules.
[02:04:37.635 --> 02:04:39.656]  And he was just, rules, that's why.
[02:04:39.656 --> 02:04:40.376]  I'm like, dude.
[02:04:41.781 --> 02:04:47.843]  This show has more viewers and listeners than the biggest Fox shows, conservatively.
[02:04:47.843 --> 02:04:50.464]  5 billion views on YouTube, dumb butt!
[02:04:50.464 --> 02:04:58.366]  He's so disconnected with his mummified brain that he really thinks being on the big Fox peacock thing is a big deal.
[02:04:58.366 --> 02:04:59.486]  It's embarrassing!
[02:04:59.486 --> 02:05:01.207]  Fox offered me a show, moron!
[02:05:02.495 --> 02:05:10.522]  It's only recently that Trump has mainstreamed the term globalist so effectively that they can no longer hide from the label, but they still try to hide their true agenda.
[02:05:10.522 --> 02:05:17.889]  The Christian Post pointed out that globalism is a secular, humanistic religion of sorts that envisions a one-world government.
[02:05:17.889 --> 02:05:18.890]  An American Thinker article
[02:05:19.210 --> 02:05:32.102]  Title Globalism the Religion of Empire says the religion of globalism sees an earthly utopian world order in which all men pay allegiance to elite priests who rule over a world city without national borders.
[02:05:32.102 --> 02:05:34.644]  The globalists will erase not only geographical borders
[02:05:34.824 --> 02:05:38.367]  But the boundaries on how government will intrude into your life.
[02:05:38.367 --> 02:05:42.190]  You can forget the First Amendment and the rest of the Bill of Rights if they succeed.
[02:05:42.190 --> 02:05:50.856]  Even those like Jeremy Rabkin, who don't support Trump, see that the globalists seek to, quote, organize the world in a way that establishes an artificial consensus.
[02:05:50.856 --> 02:05:52.778]  It's not enough to say it's undemocratic.
[02:05:52.778 --> 02:05:53.799]  It's threatening.
[02:05:53.799 --> 02:05:55.060]  It's almost demonic.
[02:05:55.060 --> 02:06:00.143]  It is a world organized independently of people's fundamental religious convictions.
[02:06:00.143 --> 02:06:01.845]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:06:02.737 --> 02:06:09.202]  Uh, yeah, Alex, first of all, I want to say, Bigfoot 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[02:06:09.202 --> 02:06:10.182]  I use them all.
[02:06:10.182 --> 02:06:11.163]  They're phenomenal.
[02:06:11.163 --> 02:06:11.904]  They work.
[02:06:11.904 --> 02:06:12.744]  Buy them, folks.
[02:06:12.744 --> 02:06:13.125]  Thank you, brother.
[02:06:13.125 --> 02:06:15.146]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[02:06:15.146 --> 02:06:21.971]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[02:06:21.971 --> 02:06:23.352]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[02:06:23.352 --> 02:06:28.776]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[02:06:29.216 --> 02:06:29.917]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[02:06:29.917 --> 02:06:33.680]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, AcuFX, uh, Nascent... Right!
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:34.601]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:06:34.601 --> 02:06:35.662]  Have they worked for you?
[02:06:35.662 --> 02:06:38.504]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[02:06:38.504 --> 02:06:39.585]  What products are you taking?
[02:06:39.585 --> 02:06:45.871]  Are you taking... Everything from, uh, Supermail to, uh, Brain Force to Winter Sun, uh, X2.
[02:06:45.871 --> 02:06:47.873]  Even got a little, uh, DNA Force.
[02:06:47.873 --> 02:06:51.336]  So, and I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[02:06:51.496 --> 02:06:56.541]  Visit Infowarslives.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[02:06:56.541 --> 02:06:58.582]  That's Infowarslives.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:07:02.617 --> 02:07:09.120]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:21.766]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[02:07:22.106 --> 02:07:25.769]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:07:25.769 --> 02:07:32.733]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:07:32.733 --> 02:07:45.622]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:07:45.622 --> 02:07:47.163]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:07:47.443 --> 02:07:53.828]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[02:07:53.828 --> 02:07:59.952]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:07:59.952 --> 02:08:08.078]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought.
[02:08:15.609 --> 02:08:18.271]  By the military industrial commons.
[02:08:18.271 --> 02:08:24.256]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[02:08:24.256 --> 02:08:30.581]  The first report to say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[02:08:30.581 --> 02:08:31.842]  It is a big idea.
[02:08:31.842 --> 02:08:33.203]  A new world order.
[02:08:33.203 --> 02:08:40.648]  It was almost as if there were a plan to implode him.
[02:08:40.648 --> 02:08:41.649]  Hit Justin.
[02:08:41.649 --> 02:08:42.150]  Bang him.
[02:08:45.370 --> 02:09:00.025]  Are you with us, or are you with the terrorists?
[02:09:00.025 --> 02:09:06.992]  I also believe that a lot of government should agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[02:09:11.667 --> 02:09:12.748]  The guns will be taken.
[02:09:12.748 --> 02:09:15.671]  No one will be able to be harmed.
[02:09:15.671 --> 02:09:17.172]  We're going to take all the weapons.
[02:09:17.172 --> 02:09:20.355]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[02:09:20.355 --> 02:09:21.777]  Is global governance at last?
[02:09:21.777 --> 02:09:24.199]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[02:09:24.199 --> 02:09:27.502]  Aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[02:09:27.502 --> 02:09:32.447]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[02:09:32.447 --> 02:09:33.608]  Do you understand?
[02:09:34.348 --> 02:09:39.152]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:09:39.152 --> 02:09:41.874]  Owen Schroer is our guest.
[02:09:41.874 --> 02:09:43.755]  He is, of course, an InfoWars.com reporter.
[02:09:43.755 --> 02:09:49.900]  He's about to punch out and get ready for the nightly news, which, of course, will air at 7 o'clock Central Standard Time tonight.
[02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:51.902]  He's going to be hosting this evening.
[02:09:51.902 --> 02:09:54.364]  I'm going to file a special report on that as well.
[02:09:54.364 --> 02:09:56.886]  We've got Dr. Steve Pachinik joining us to talk about the debate.
[02:09:57.526 --> 02:09:57.986]  We're good to go.
[02:10:08.717 --> 02:10:11.518]  He's talked a lot about the silent coup that's happened.
[02:10:11.518 --> 02:10:21.382]  Four years ago, after Benghazi, when our military refused to bomb Syria and battle for Al-Qaeda, and now ISIS, he exposed it here first.
[02:10:21.382 --> 02:10:28.084]  We had other guests that confirmed it, like Colonel Schaefer and many, many, many, many others.
[02:10:28.084 --> 02:10:32.386]  And they hauled Schaefer into Congress over what he said on the show.
[02:10:33.406 --> 02:10:42.455]  He has to be really careful when he comes on now, but he actually briefed Congress on the fact that about 98% of the fighters were Wahhabist.
[02:10:42.455 --> 02:10:45.498]  Call them Al Qaeda, call them ISIS, it's all the same thing.
[02:10:45.498 --> 02:10:50.223]  Steve McKinnick.com is his website, we're going to go to him in a moment, but I wanted to ask him just in general areas,
[02:10:53.396 --> 02:11:01.143]  Why they're celebrating on Charlie Rose saying, oh yeah, ha ha ha, you can keep your doctor, boy, we wrote a great line on Obamacare.
[02:11:01.143 --> 02:11:05.487]  Or Grouper says, thank God the public's dumb, ha ha ha, and then he goes on C-SPAN and says it again.
[02:11:05.487 --> 02:11:10.952]  And while we have the State Department's head spokesman saying, you know, we lied to everybody, it's so funny, ha ha ha.
[02:11:10.952 --> 02:11:13.875]  And Gibbs saying, you know, there's no drone program even though there is, ha ha ha.
[02:11:14.395 --> 02:11:15.496]  What is the psychology?
[02:11:15.496 --> 02:11:25.320]  I mean, I know in criminology criminals like to brag, but I don't get this weird celebration, or is there a method to the madness where they're just inoculating us to accept the fact that they're criminals?
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:27.981]  Because it really looks like psychosis.
[02:11:27.981 --> 02:11:31.102]  Now, I only took a few courses in college on psychology.
[02:11:31.102 --> 02:11:34.984]  I'm not a, you know, an MD and a psychiatrist and, you know, everything else like he is.
[02:11:34.984 --> 02:11:41.907]  He has multiple, you know, degrees from Harvard and MIT, but he's one of the top, you know, educated folks, but also in the field on these subjects.
[02:11:41.907 --> 02:11:42.567]  I mean, again,
[02:11:43.672 --> 02:11:45.514]  I found out that Chuck Yeager was a listener in Houston.
[02:11:45.514 --> 02:11:46.235]  He wanted to come on.
[02:11:46.235 --> 02:11:48.918]  Then his lawyer said, oh no, you know, don't go on there.
[02:11:48.918 --> 02:11:49.840]  It's too radical.
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:53.304]  I just think it's cool that I, you know, we got to talk to Chuck Yeager's people and found out he is a listener.
[02:11:55.029 --> 02:11:56.750]  Folks were asking me, who's Chuck Yeager?
[02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:58.011]  So it's kind of like, who cares?
[02:11:58.011 --> 02:12:04.094]  You know, the guy that broke the sound barrier, the guy that shot down, you know, 50 Nazis or whatever it is, you know, Super Ace, like the third best U.S.
[02:12:04.094 --> 02:12:04.675]  Ace.
[02:12:04.675 --> 02:12:07.576]  People just don't even care, you know.
[02:12:07.576 --> 02:12:09.818]  But, I mean, Steve Pachinko is a heavyweight.
[02:12:09.818 --> 02:12:21.104]  And it's not that we want to sit here and kiss his ass and say, oh, he's this big, great guy and the composite character for Jack Ryan and the Patriot Games and produced a bunch of big Hollywood films and co-wrote a bunch of Tom Clancy's books, blah, blah, blah.
[02:12:22.845 --> 02:12:37.449]  We'll sit there and look at some candy-ass, lying, you know, white-shoe lawyer, PR flack, spew BS at us, and then, oh, it's so slick, it's so cool, because there's a State Department insignia behind him.
[02:12:37.449 --> 02:12:42.970]  But then when the people who have actually overthrown countries are on, notice the media doesn't ever cover when Pchenik's on.
[02:12:42.970 --> 02:12:45.571]  They'll always cherry-pick stuff out of context.
[02:12:45.571 --> 02:12:47.032]  They're scared of what he talks about.
[02:12:47.032 --> 02:12:48.492]  They don't like it.
[02:12:48.492 --> 02:12:51.973]  I had, years ago, I don't know why I'm telling the story, but it's good to just get background for the listeners.
[02:12:53.612 --> 02:13:01.763]  I'd go on Japanese TV, British TV, Russian TV, I still go on it sometimes, but it was RT Nationwide, and they said, oh, we would like you to come on a special 30-minute show.
[02:13:01.763 --> 02:13:04.467]  And I said, okay, I'll come on that show.
[02:13:04.467 --> 02:13:09.914]  So I go in my office, turn on the computer, and all of a sudden, it's not a Russian TV show.
[02:13:10.928 --> 02:13:21.153]  It's like some government command building with this big giant long table of all these like brain bug Russians with big beards and you can tell they're all like KGB, FSB.
[02:13:21.153 --> 02:13:23.114]  Why do you know Pachinik?
[02:13:23.114 --> 02:13:25.475]  How does he come to talk to you?
[02:13:25.475 --> 02:13:26.656]  Are you a government agent?
[02:13:26.656 --> 02:13:29.197]  You know, I mean this is like something out of a movie, okay?
[02:13:29.197 --> 02:13:32.359]  And I'm like realizing like this isn't Russian TV, is it?
[02:13:32.359 --> 02:13:35.981]  I'm like there's like government flags in a command room.
[02:13:36.901 --> 02:13:40.084]  And so, I'm telling you, that's the weirdness.
[02:13:40.084 --> 02:13:48.751]  And then I had this Mossad agent, one of the top guys in the country, whose cover is writing for a major magazine, and he gets there and I go, I know this is really a visit from the Mossad.
[02:13:48.751 --> 02:13:52.554]  He goes, well, sure, but I'm... Well, how'd you know that?
[02:13:52.554 --> 02:13:53.575]  I'm not really doing an article.
[02:13:53.575 --> 02:13:55.837]  I just want to see what you're planning to do to Israel.
[02:13:55.837 --> 02:13:57.618]  And I'm just like, I'm not against Israel.
[02:13:57.618 --> 02:13:58.539]  I'm not against anybody.
[02:13:58.539 --> 02:14:00.300]  I'm against World War III.
[02:14:00.300 --> 02:14:00.581]  And so,
[02:14:01.803 --> 02:14:02.224]  You're against me?
[02:14:17.865 --> 02:14:20.868]  Multiple times with reporters as cover.
[02:14:20.868 --> 02:14:27.153]  And then they sit there when there's no recording and you go, yeah, I'm here for the CIA to ask you to please stop doing this and Obama would really like it if you'd stop.
[02:14:27.153 --> 02:14:32.138]  I had one guy get on his knees, okay, and beg me to stop doing what I'm doing.
[02:14:32.138 --> 02:14:33.539]  Basically because we don't want to kill you.
[02:14:33.539 --> 02:14:37.863]  Now, the reason I'm telling all this now is this is the real world I live in just as a reporter.
[02:14:38.243 --> 02:14:42.504]  Who isn't trying to destroy the country that wants lower taxes, that wants fair trade deals?
[02:14:42.504 --> 02:14:44.544]  So I kind of told you up front, you know, that's the issue.
[02:14:44.544 --> 02:14:47.805]  You come to work here, though, you're getting on the Millennium Falcon.
[02:14:47.805 --> 02:14:51.186]  I mean, this is not like you're going to fight the empire in some far-off corner.
[02:14:51.186 --> 02:15:00.888]  And the empire are these global corporations that are crony, that are anti-free market, that are attacking what made us great because they see it as competition instead of the fertile soil that's going to launch us to the stars.
[02:15:01.488 --> 02:15:03.210]  So, closing comments and I'm going to state the genesis.
[02:15:03.210 --> 02:15:06.254]  Who wouldn't get on the Millennium Falcon, honestly?
[02:15:06.254 --> 02:15:12.441]  But even, I've been working here for just over a month and I get people sending me stuff all day long, I can't even imagine what it would be like for you.
[02:15:12.441 --> 02:15:17.827]  But real quick, back to what you said about Johnson, I want to point this out, how he didn't want to say... He doesn't even know what planet he's on!
[02:15:17.987 --> 02:15:23.872]  He doesn't want to say, he doesn't want to answer the question and say a president because he doesn't want to offend anyone, he wants to be politically correct, so he just decides to look like a president.
[02:15:23.872 --> 02:15:24.713]  No language!
[02:15:24.713 --> 02:15:26.514]  Who's your favorite president, foreign president?
[02:15:26.514 --> 02:15:27.755]  Ugh, ugh.
[02:15:27.755 --> 02:15:31.999]  Right, he would rather look like a complete fool than actually give an answer.
[02:15:31.999 --> 02:15:34.581]  And this is the psychological war that you talk about with Plutonic.
[02:15:35.181 --> 02:15:43.565]  If they can make you censor yourself, if they can make you censor your own speech, if they can make you afraid to speak your mind, they don't have to get rid of the First Amendment.
[02:15:43.565 --> 02:15:44.985]  They don't even have to touch the Constitution.
[02:15:44.985 --> 02:15:45.506]  It doesn't matter.
[02:15:45.506 --> 02:15:48.387]  They created a basket case with zero confidence.
[02:15:48.387 --> 02:15:52.789]  We're taught how to have no confidence, no new true thoughts or liberal ideas.
[02:15:53.129 --> 02:15:56.131]  So, tonight on the Nightly News, we're going to have a bunch of stuff.
[02:15:56.131 --> 02:15:58.793]  You know, Obama spoke last night, too.
[02:15:58.793 --> 02:16:00.654]  He did a little presidential town hall.
[02:16:00.654 --> 02:16:02.736]  I thought that was going to be a straight-up Trump-bashing session.
[02:16:02.736 --> 02:16:03.857]  It ended up not being.
[02:16:03.857 --> 02:16:05.758]  But he said a bunch of stuff we can expose him on.
[02:16:05.758 --> 02:16:06.518]  We'll talk about that.
[02:16:06.518 --> 02:16:07.719]  We've got more Obamacare.
[02:16:07.719 --> 02:16:14.144]  And I'll be doing a follow-up interview from my report with Andrew Kerr, who wrote a scathing report on Brock's activity.
[02:16:14.144 --> 02:16:18.927]  He's also done more reports relating them to the Clinton and all these other super PACs.
[02:16:18.927 --> 02:16:19.788]  So, we're going to expose him.
[02:16:19.788 --> 02:16:21.409]  And he said his goal
[02:16:22.049 --> 02:16:26.512]  Is to force this into the mainstream and get media matters audited.
[02:16:26.512 --> 02:16:29.433]  Could you even imagine, Alex, how vindicated would you feel?
[02:16:29.433 --> 02:16:34.496]  They're not going to do it though because the IRS admittedly persecutes patriots.
[02:16:34.496 --> 02:16:38.339]  They even go after veterans groups that try to get better health care for veterans.
[02:16:38.999 --> 02:16:43.442]  These are the most sickening evil people, because they have a competition who can be more evil.
[02:16:43.442 --> 02:16:45.164]  So it's like, what do we do here?
[02:16:45.164 --> 02:16:46.444]  I've got the documents.
[02:16:46.444 --> 02:16:48.386]  We've caught him red-handed, okay?
[02:16:48.386 --> 02:16:53.770]  David Brock is colluding and laundering money in the Democratic Party platform.
[02:16:53.770 --> 02:16:56.372]  We caught you, and then they're just not going to do anything.
[02:16:56.372 --> 02:16:57.272]  So what do we do?
[02:16:57.272 --> 02:17:00.935]  We take the Millennium Falcon to the next light year and fight the next battle.
[02:17:01.035 --> 02:17:01.575]  That's right.
[02:17:01.575 --> 02:17:02.856]  Owen Troyer, great job.
[02:17:02.856 --> 02:17:04.777]  Anthony Kumia is going to host the fourth hour.
[02:17:04.777 --> 02:17:06.218]  I want to go to Dr. Steve Pchenik now.
[02:17:06.218 --> 02:17:06.798]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:17:06.798 --> 02:17:08.059]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:17:08.059 --> 02:17:11.341]  And Doc, I didn't mean to go into that whole rant earlier about you or me or any of this.
[02:17:11.341 --> 02:17:12.782]  I just don't think people understand.
[02:17:12.782 --> 02:17:15.083]  This isn't a TV show that's like entertainment.
[02:17:15.083 --> 02:17:16.164]  This isn't fiction.
[02:17:17.044 --> 02:17:28.134]  The general public needs to know exactly what's going on here and the fact that you and I and others are having such a big effect against this criminal, piratical group of criminals shows that they're not invincible.
[02:17:28.134 --> 02:17:29.615]  In fact, they're quite weak.
[02:17:29.615 --> 02:17:39.224]  And the fact that Hillary's coming out naming us, the fact that they're all panicking, the fact they're claiming I'm a Russian agent has really, really a window, I think,
[02:17:39.324 --> 02:17:39.484]  I'm good.
[02:17:49.403 --> 02:17:58.047]  Well, I want to thank you and all the people who work with you and of course the audience that's been with us for what, over 14 years.
[02:17:58.047 --> 02:18:02.770]  And I think they, you and they, deserve most of the credit.
[02:18:02.770 --> 02:18:10.713]  My input is basically to say, look, this is my experience, this is where I want to reality test some issues.
[02:18:10.713 --> 02:18:11.454]  And as you know,
[02:18:12.182 --> 02:18:19.148]  Sometimes I make a prophecy and often it becomes true, but it's not a question that I'm just throwing it out in the air.
[02:18:19.148 --> 02:18:26.053]  It's based on a lot of the issues that I know, the past experiences, but it really resonates with the American public.
[02:18:26.053 --> 02:18:37.743]  Now, we are at a point where we do have what I think the most effective revolution we've had in over 40 to 50 years without fighting, without guns, without weapons.
[02:18:38.414 --> 02:18:40.675]  And I see this all over the United States.
[02:18:40.675 --> 02:18:43.356]  I just traveled over 4,000 miles.
[02:18:43.356 --> 02:18:44.796]  And you can hear the rumbling.
[02:18:44.796 --> 02:18:48.438]  You can hear the fact that people are questioning Hillary.
[02:18:48.438 --> 02:18:51.999]  They're now talking about her illness or Parkinsonism.
[02:18:51.999 --> 02:18:57.601]  And then you find out, as a result of all of the things that we've done, including you in the audience,
[02:18:58.021 --> 02:19:12.993]  Then Michael Savage, Dr. Michael Savage, whose PhD is in Ethnocentric Medicines or Ethnic Medicines, which is a PhD program, was thrown off the air on WABC for simply reading
[02:19:13.593 --> 02:19:19.458]  The diagnosis that I made, Dr. Drew made, and a bunch of others, a doctor.
[02:19:19.458 --> 02:19:32.650]  Yeah, he has one of these rare, I mean, almost medical degrees in his classification, correct me if I'm wrong, because it's the original apothecary, and that's a pretty high level degree, he's a really smart guy, 400 stations, but listen, he's suddenly radio silent.
[02:19:32.650 --> 02:19:36.153]  He told me last week, in front of the crew here on Skype in the break, he said, Alex,
[02:19:36.613 --> 02:19:37.954]  I don't know how long I'm going to be on the air.
[02:19:37.954 --> 02:19:39.394]  CBS is really censoring me.
[02:19:39.394 --> 02:19:43.035]  I want to air this interview on my show today, but they're not letting me.
[02:19:43.035 --> 02:19:44.176]  And he was really upset.
[02:19:44.176 --> 02:19:48.337]  So, the point is, this really shows how desperate they are, and that's what I'm getting at.
[02:19:48.337 --> 02:19:51.539]  We have the Pope coming out, and I hate to interrupt you, but I've got to shoot your horn.
[02:19:51.539 --> 02:19:58.962]  You were on two weeks ago, and you said that Tim Kaine, who had attacked me that very day, saying I'm this horrible, evil, deplorable, racist person with no evidence, her VP,
[02:20:00.262 --> 02:20:05.547]  Was basically a Jesuit operative, and that their failed system was feeding Hillary's agenda.
[02:20:05.547 --> 02:20:19.699]  The Pope came out in a Catholic newspaper, it's on Infowars.com, and word for word quoted Hillary and Cain about deplorable conspiracy theorist media are terrorists, these are quotes, and should be shut down.
[02:20:19.699 --> 02:20:21.141]  For me, that's incredible proof
[02:20:22.429 --> 02:20:25.311]  Is he getting talking points from them or are they getting them from him?
[02:20:25.311 --> 02:20:28.572]  Because this is word for word.
[02:20:28.572 --> 02:20:35.156]  Let me reiterate what I've said to you and what I've written for over 10, 15 years.
[02:20:35.156 --> 02:20:49.683]  I knew the Pope when he was the Jesuit director under the Argentinian military coup which killed thousands and thousands of people by eliminating them completely.
[02:20:50.573 --> 02:21:06.066]  I was asked by the Argentinian military in the late 1970s during the Carter administration to come over to Argentina and assist the colonels in basically dealing with what they called communists.
[02:21:06.066 --> 02:21:17.555]  Now, what they meant by communists were innocent citizens as well as innocent Christians, primarily Catholic priests, Catholic nuns, who were herded together
[02:21:18.135 --> 02:21:25.459]  Well, he not only helped and worked with the colonels and allowed many of the colonels to kill
[02:21:46.724 --> 02:21:57.974]  And abscond with Jesuit priests, two of them who were arrested and eventually tortured, and sanctioned the torture and the death of four other nuns.
[02:21:57.974 --> 02:22:06.962]  So this Pope is exactly like Pope, the one who was a former Nazi, and so on and so forth.
[02:22:06.962 --> 02:22:13.608]  My interest is not so much in the Pope, but what you said, Alex, and I didn't realize that he was stupid enough
[02:22:14.248 --> 02:22:21.776]  To literally take the words and to try to rationalize the fact that Cain of course was a Jesuit.
[02:22:21.776 --> 02:22:23.938]  The reason is I treated these guys.
[02:22:23.938 --> 02:22:28.923]  I used to treat them... Sure, well you said it looks like Hillary is being run by Jesuits to a certain extent.
[02:22:28.923 --> 02:22:31.605]  Well... But I mean now we have them word for word, sir.
[02:22:31.605 --> 02:22:34.989]  What I'm saying is they are word for word copying each other.
[02:22:34.989 --> 02:22:36.370]  So they're in lockstep at this point.
[02:22:36.510 --> 02:22:39.634]  Correct, but what's happening, Alex, is, let me get it clear.
[02:22:39.634 --> 02:22:40.595]  Sure, go ahead, sorry.
[02:22:40.595 --> 02:22:42.478]  It's exactly what you said.
[02:22:42.478 --> 02:22:51.350]  It's not a question of malevolence only, it's a question of incredible stupidity and a lack of understanding of how self-incriminating
[02:22:51.990 --> 02:23:02.103]  Both Tim Kaine was, because he was in fact working with Negro Ponte, a very good ambassador, but at the same time a strong operative with the CIA.
[02:23:02.103 --> 02:23:04.686]  We had a very strong presence in Honduras.
[02:23:04.686 --> 02:23:07.209]  I flew there and then went on to Noriega.
[02:23:07.769 --> 02:23:21.233]  The generals in Argentina who asked me to come forth, I have to thank Secretary of State Vance under Jimmy Carter, who said to the generals that if Dr. Pchenik doesn't want to work with you, he will not work with you.
[02:23:21.233 --> 02:23:27.035]  And not only that, I went up to the Secretary of State and asked him, could I work against them?
[02:23:27.035 --> 02:23:27.775]  And I did.
[02:23:27.775 --> 02:23:35.998]  And eventually, we were able to get rid of the colonels and eventually get rid of the Jesuit director, who then went on to become the Pope Francis.
[02:23:36.318 --> 02:23:36.718]  Amazing.
[02:23:36.718 --> 02:23:38.619]  So what does this signify?
[02:23:38.619 --> 02:23:39.739]  You brought it up so it must be important.
[02:23:54.326 --> 02:23:59.452]  To the overriding suppression and terror of any system.
[02:23:59.452 --> 02:24:02.995]  In Argentina, people were disappearing night and day.
[02:24:02.995 --> 02:24:13.787]  The Jesuit director, at that time he was cardinal, was so frightened and so compromised that he had nothing to say and in fact was collusive.
[02:24:14.487 --> 02:24:22.376]  In the real world of civil law and even Catholic law, this Pope should be indicted for collusion and murder.
[02:24:22.376 --> 02:24:23.357]  That's what I said.
[02:24:23.357 --> 02:24:27.281]  I've said it for 30 years and I will not step away from that.
[02:24:27.281 --> 02:24:31.606]  In fact, what happened is I created the Br'er Rabbit in that Jesuit
[02:24:32.146 --> 02:24:46.385]  Pope, and in fact Tim Kaine stuck to it, and Hillary, because they don't really understand the history of how the Jesuits work for us both on the CIA side and as well on the theological side.
[02:24:46.385 --> 02:24:49.470]  At the same time, Hillary has been so porous.
[02:24:50.130 --> 02:24:52.432]  That's my next question.
[02:24:52.432 --> 02:24:54.694]  What do you make of that performance?
[02:24:54.694 --> 02:24:55.175]  I know he was advised...
[02:25:06.344 --> 02:25:11.669]  And the reason I'm not happy is the same reason I called up many months ago to say Manafort has to go.
[02:25:11.669 --> 02:25:17.954]  And in fact, I will categorically state it again, and Trump will not like this, neither will his group.
[02:25:17.954 --> 02:25:20.896]  He cannot have the group that he has now.
[02:25:20.896 --> 02:25:27.261]  General Michael Flynn is a great DIA, he's a defense intelligence agent, but he is not a psychological warrior.
[02:25:27.361 --> 02:25:29.342]  Well, he's not the one advising.
[02:25:29.342 --> 02:25:36.967]  He's basically trying to... I mean, there's no one there who understands, who has had the experience, and I'm going to say I've had it in two different administrations.
[02:25:36.967 --> 02:25:37.307]  No, I know.
[02:25:37.307 --> 02:25:38.828]  You've overthrown countries and propped them up.
[02:25:38.828 --> 02:25:39.089]  No, no, no.
[02:25:39.089 --> 02:25:40.369]  I'm not talking about that.
[02:25:40.369 --> 02:25:40.970]  I understand.
[02:25:40.970 --> 02:25:42.991]  So how would you advise Trump?
[02:25:42.991 --> 02:25:43.551]  What would you say?
[02:25:43.551 --> 02:25:44.292]  No, no, no.
[02:25:44.292 --> 02:25:46.233]  What I'm asking now, I can't advise him.
[02:25:46.233 --> 02:25:48.174]  I can tell him to do strategically.
[02:25:48.174 --> 02:25:49.015]  It's very simple.
[02:25:49.775 --> 02:25:52.016]  He has to get rid of the people he has there.
[02:25:52.016 --> 02:25:56.398]  He starts with a group of three and ends up with two dozen people.
[02:25:56.398 --> 02:26:00.761]  When I worked with Baker and Roger Ailes, Ailes knows this better than anyone.
[02:26:00.761 --> 02:26:10.786]  You need to know the psychological dynamic of Hillary working in a very constrained period of time, over 15-20 minutes, and how she baits him.
[02:26:10.786 --> 02:26:14.207]  At the same time, he has to know how vulnerable she is.
[02:26:14.207 --> 02:26:15.588]  So what's her vulnerability?
[02:26:16.028 --> 02:26:21.450]  The fact of the matter is that her agenda and resume is a complete vulnerability.
[02:26:21.450 --> 02:26:22.951]  Sure, I'd bring up all the failed states.
[02:26:22.951 --> 02:26:25.111]  I'd bring up ISIS killing Christians by the hundreds of thousands.
[02:26:25.111 --> 02:26:26.092]  Well, not only that.
[02:26:26.092 --> 02:26:27.652]  It's even more basic than that.
[02:26:27.652 --> 02:26:37.416]  You know, he started to do this when she said, I was a senator, and say, in fact, well, you claimed, you, Hillary, claimed you would bring in 200,000 jobs.
[02:26:37.416 --> 02:26:39.597]  Over eight years, there were no job increases.
[02:26:39.597 --> 02:26:41.437]  As a matter of fact, there was a 25% decrease in jobs.
[02:26:43.378 --> 02:26:44.539]  Trump didn't say that.
[02:26:44.539 --> 02:26:50.724]  Instead, he got hooked and she baited him right into talking about ad hominem.
[02:26:50.724 --> 02:26:57.089]  Sure, but in fairness, Dr. Puccini, what do you make of Lester Holt 40 plus times interrupting the signals?
[02:26:57.089 --> 02:27:00.872]  With all due respect, Alex, I had two different candidates
[02:27:01.492 --> 02:27:03.813]  Who had all kinds of intermediaries.
[02:27:03.813 --> 02:27:10.377]  The key to any strategy in the debate is to take control of your own dynamic, which he has not.
[02:27:10.377 --> 02:27:11.217]  No, I agree.
[02:27:11.217 --> 02:27:17.040]  Listen, I ignore whatever they're saying and just cover the facts and have the energy and show that I'm dominating them.
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:23.143]  That's correct, but you're a little bit different in the fact that you do have this history of consistency.
[02:27:23.143 --> 02:27:28.065]  You know what you're talking about and you don't have to deal with an interloper.
[02:27:28.065 --> 02:27:28.826]  In this case,
[02:27:29.987 --> 02:27:33.830]  Trump is really coming off of his own narcissism.
[02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:35.191]  He can't do that.
[02:27:35.191 --> 02:27:39.254]  There is no one there who can put him in and check and say, look,
[02:27:39.858 --> 02:27:41.139]  This is what you have to do.
[02:27:41.139 --> 02:27:47.745]  These are the steps in a psychological warfare when you're dealing with somebody over a five-minute period of time.
[02:27:47.745 --> 02:27:51.449]  It's not the same as you're dealing with them over three years or four years.
[02:27:51.449 --> 02:27:53.070]  He doesn't have anyone like that.
[02:27:53.070 --> 02:27:57.034]  He's hired all kinds of people who've had no experience whatsoever.
[02:27:57.034 --> 02:27:57.714]  Oh, I agree.
[02:27:57.714 --> 02:27:58.555]  He's got a bunch.
[02:27:58.555 --> 02:28:00.337]  I mean, some of these people he's got working for him.
[02:28:00.337 --> 02:28:02.118]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:28:02.118 --> 02:28:03.099]  What did they ever build?
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:05.522]  I mean, they do not know what they're doing.
[02:28:05.522 --> 02:28:09.265]  No, I mean, James Woolsey comes on to support Trump.
[02:28:09.265 --> 02:28:10.246]  I knew James Woolsey.
[02:28:10.246 --> 02:28:13.328]  He was a disaster as a CIA director.
[02:28:13.328 --> 02:28:15.010]  A complete disaster.
[02:28:15.010 --> 02:28:18.593]  The man never even saw Bill Clinton for two and a half years.
[02:28:18.593 --> 02:28:21.395]  Then he was a neocon who wanted 9-11.
[02:28:21.395 --> 02:28:23.517]  The man is a disaster.
[02:28:23.517 --> 02:28:25.559]  He's not good in intelligence.
[02:28:25.559 --> 02:28:29.563]  He's totally oriented to war and profiteering.
[02:28:29.563 --> 02:28:30.784]  He's a second-rate man.
[02:28:31.324 --> 02:28:36.648]  The issue here isn't about who he can put on board and who likes him or doesn't like him.
[02:28:36.648 --> 02:28:38.410]  The issue is very simple.
[02:28:38.410 --> 02:28:39.571]  It's like a building.
[02:28:39.571 --> 02:28:40.752]  Do you have a strategy?
[02:28:40.752 --> 02:28:42.513]  Do you have a tactic?
[02:28:42.513 --> 02:28:44.434]  Implement it systematically.
[02:28:44.434 --> 02:28:46.236]  He has no one there who can do it for him.
[02:28:46.776 --> 02:28:48.497]  Michael Flynn cannot do it for him.
[02:28:48.497 --> 02:28:50.497]  General Kellogg cannot do it for him.
[02:28:50.497 --> 02:28:52.878]  The woman who's in charge can't do it for him.
[02:28:52.878 --> 02:28:54.138]  He has no one there.
[02:28:54.138 --> 02:29:06.362]  It was not an accident that I was called in by Bush Senior's people, Baker and others and Hadley and new administrations because they knew exactly what it is that one has to do.
[02:29:06.362 --> 02:29:08.422]  It's not a fanciful game.
[02:29:08.422 --> 02:29:09.402]  It's very simple.
[02:29:09.402 --> 02:29:11.223]  It's strategy of psychology.
[02:29:11.223 --> 02:29:13.403]  They're not trained in psychology.
[02:29:13.403 --> 02:29:15.064]  So I'm warning Trump again.
[02:29:15.744 --> 02:29:21.227]  He came to the forefront because people like you and I and the audience supported him.
[02:29:21.227 --> 02:29:25.729]  But I can assure him that that audience is getting very disappointed with him.
[02:29:25.729 --> 02:29:27.550]  Sure, he has to continue to be a populist.
[02:29:27.550 --> 02:29:31.992]  This isn't where you just become a politician and now that you're the... No, but not only that, he has to be...
[02:29:33.001 --> 02:29:35.982]  Alex, he has to be able to articulate what he wants to say.
[02:29:35.982 --> 02:29:38.082]  Well, let's come back then and spend five minutes.
[02:29:38.082 --> 02:29:39.763]  You're going to be Donald Trump with Hillary.
[02:29:39.763 --> 02:29:40.503]  What you say to her.
[02:29:40.503 --> 02:29:43.483]  Then I'm going to get into other geopolitical things that are taking place.
[02:29:43.483 --> 02:29:44.564]  And more with Dr. Steve McShanning.
[02:29:44.564 --> 02:29:45.524]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:45.524 --> 02:29:47.444]  Infowars.com is our website.
[02:29:47.444 --> 02:29:48.345]  They're trying to censor it.
[02:29:48.345 --> 02:29:49.685]  Spread that link to everyone.
[02:29:49.685 --> 02:29:51.165]  Download the free app, Infowars.com.
[02:29:51.165 --> 02:29:52.986]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.986 --> 02:29:55.506]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.506 --> 02:29:58.187]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.580 --> 02:30:06.383]  A CNN headline quotes a wealthy Venezuelan saying, I flew to the U.S.
[02:30:06.383 --> 02:30:08.264]  to buy toilet paper.
[02:30:08.264 --> 02:30:20.313]  Venezuela, where the poor are hunting dogs and cats for food, where the criminals are hunting down and killing police for their guns, and where the communist dictator gave Wall Street 700% return on their investment.
[02:30:20.313 --> 02:30:27.638]  The communists and the banksters have destroyed the country so thoroughly that even the wealthy have to get out of the country if they want to wipe their butts.
[02:30:28.038 --> 02:30:31.320]  A true excrement hits the fan scenario.
[02:30:31.320 --> 02:30:38.224]  The 66-year-old Venezuelan flew to New York and went shopping at Whole Foods, fighting back tears when she saw a fully stocked food shelf.
[02:30:38.224 --> 02:30:42.806]  She said, you are so happy when you find something as basic as milk.
[02:30:42.806 --> 02:30:43.947]  The Socialist Welfare State
[02:30:44.187 --> 02:30:47.228]  And there's another lesson to learn from this wealthy Venezuelan.
[02:30:47.228 --> 02:30:51.750]  It doesn't matter how much money you have if there's no food and medicine when these crooks destroy your economy.
[02:31:02.555 --> 02:31:05.736]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:31:05.736 --> 02:31:08.097]  Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:32:00.277 --> 02:32:04.539]  BrainForce, it's completely different.
[02:32:04.539 --> 02:32:05.780]  Try a bottle of it.
[02:32:05.780 --> 02:32:07.360]  Rob Dew joins us.
[02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:10.461]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[02:32:10.461 --> 02:32:11.542]  Tell us what BrainForce did.
[02:32:11.542 --> 02:32:12.502]  I'd been working all day.
[02:32:12.502 --> 02:32:15.003]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[02:32:15.003 --> 02:32:16.424]  I get in here at 830.
[02:32:16.424 --> 02:32:18.324]  I was kind of run down.
[02:32:18.324 --> 02:32:20.045]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[02:32:20.265 --> 02:32:22.146]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[02:32:22.146 --> 02:32:23.967]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[02:32:23.967 --> 02:32:25.028]  I popped two of them.
[02:32:25.028 --> 02:32:27.309]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[02:32:27.309 --> 02:32:29.110]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:30.751]  It's got four and a half stars.
[02:32:30.751 --> 02:32:32.092]  People really love it.
[02:32:32.092 --> 02:32:32.692]  Read about it.
[02:32:32.692 --> 02:32:36.534]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[02:32:36.534 --> 02:32:41.797]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[02:32:41.997 --> 02:32:46.019]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[02:32:46.019 --> 02:32:52.183]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[02:32:52.183 --> 02:32:58.087]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:33:16.397 --> 02:33:23.168]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:23.168 --> 02:33:26.714]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.714 --> 02:33:29.218]  I use the word too much, but it really is the best word.
[02:33:29.218 --> 02:33:30.340]  It is surreal.
[02:33:32.333 --> 02:33:52.487]  It's like you've read history, you've seen examples of tyranny, hundreds of millions killed by out-of-control authoritarian governments, fascists, communists, you name it, in the 20th century, and you see tens of millions killed in the last 16 years, and a warm-up, a preparation, and most analysts agree, for something much more dangerous in the last century.
[02:33:53.786 --> 02:33:59.767]  And all these articles now in the Hollywood Reporter and the London Guardian about elites all running the New Zealand because of what they think is imminent collapse.
[02:33:59.767 --> 02:34:00.967]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:34:00.967 --> 02:34:02.248]  I want to stabilize things.
[02:34:02.248 --> 02:34:04.788]  I don't want to have a civil war.
[02:34:04.788 --> 02:34:07.529]  And I see George Soros running around trying to start race wars.
[02:34:07.529 --> 02:34:13.410]  His own emails come out and the UN saying they're going to, you know, have reparations for black people so the UN should run things.
[02:34:13.410 --> 02:34:17.010]  And Loretta Lynch says, I'm going to have the UN run local police.
[02:34:17.010 --> 02:34:20.111]  I mean, this is crazier than I thought they'd try.
[02:34:20.771 --> 02:34:26.373]  And I want Dr. Steve Pachinko to have a few minutes here to talk about how he would advise Trump, where he sees this election going.
[02:34:26.373 --> 02:34:32.535]  What happens if Hillary, let's war game this, does get in by fraud or whatever, and she clearly looks insane half the time.
[02:34:32.535 --> 02:34:35.156]  I want to get his expert opinion on what he thinks is wrong with her.
[02:34:35.156 --> 02:34:35.997]  There's a lot to cover.
[02:34:38.001 --> 02:34:40.602]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[02:34:40.602 --> 02:34:42.122]  A very, very incredible time to be alive.
[02:34:42.122 --> 02:34:47.703]  Before I go any further, free shipping on all products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:34:47.703 --> 02:34:52.184]  We have the new ProBionic, seven years of development and design.
[02:34:52.184 --> 02:34:55.605]  This is the cutting edge of what's going on in Europe.
[02:34:55.605 --> 02:34:59.006]  It doesn't have the fillers, 25 billion live.
[02:35:01.594 --> 02:35:08.180]  The Extra Strength version is the first one we actually have out, so it's 50 billion live.
[02:35:08.180 --> 02:35:12.684]  And then you also have all the other great things that are involved in it.

[02:35:28.416 --> 02:35:29.657]  Open pollinated seeds.
[02:35:29.657 --> 02:35:31.519]  It's great to plant with the kids.
[02:35:31.519 --> 02:35:32.320]  It's all there.
[02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:33.541]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:35:33.541 --> 02:35:34.502]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:35:34.502 --> 02:35:39.327]  And we're building this media operation with your support.
[02:35:39.327 --> 02:35:48.477]  And it's about taking action, not just physically or not just with your spoken word or what emails you send or how you vote, but also in the media you support.
[02:35:49.725 --> 02:35:50.646]  We're good to go.
[02:36:04.082 --> 02:36:07.446]  Non-GMO, heirloom, seed, vaults, and systems.

[02:36:18.558 --> 02:36:23.203]  Infowars, store.com, infowarslife.com, water filtration, air purifiers.
[02:36:23.943 --> 02:36:25.064]  Just whatever's the very best.
[02:36:25.064 --> 02:36:30.586]  You know, the newest jumper cable system with 10 different ports to jump your car 14 times.
[02:36:30.586 --> 02:36:32.607]  It's the third the size of a briefcase.
[02:36:32.607 --> 02:36:34.668]  I mean, just whatever's cutting edge is the best.
[02:36:34.668 --> 02:36:37.269]  We've got it in Full Wars, store.com and forwardslife.com.
[02:36:37.269 --> 02:36:39.750]  They're called toll free, 888-253-3139.
[02:36:39.750 --> 02:36:42.832]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:36:42.832 --> 02:36:47.654]  Now, Dr. Steve Pachinick's Twitter is twitter.com forward slash Steve Pachinick.
[02:36:47.654 --> 02:36:52.456]  You really want to follow him there to get the amazing, incisive, you know, reports.
[02:36:54.602 --> 02:36:58.545]  I mean, just look at him two weeks ago saying, ah, looks like the Jesuits are trying to run this show right now.
[02:36:58.545 --> 02:37:00.086]  Nobody's saying that.
[02:37:00.086 --> 02:37:06.991]  But you study it, you look at it, and then you see the Pope says stuff, and a week later Obama says it word for word, the same script, and then vice versa.
[02:37:06.991 --> 02:37:08.953]  I mean, this is like creepy.
[02:37:08.953 --> 02:37:09.993]  This is very, very creepy.
[02:37:11.154 --> 02:37:13.296]  And I don't know any Catholics that like this pup.
[02:37:13.296 --> 02:37:17.179]  I mean, this guy is the anti-pup at every level, but that's the type of stuff.
[02:37:17.179 --> 02:37:19.000]  Tim Kaine, liar.
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:19.841]  Well, let's put it back on screen.
[02:37:19.841 --> 02:37:20.821]  I'll give folks a headline.
[02:37:20.821 --> 02:37:22.803]  Tim Kaine, liar.
[02:37:22.803 --> 02:37:25.344]  Jesuit CI operative with dark past.
[02:37:25.344 --> 02:37:26.705]  Boy, you said it.
[02:37:26.705 --> 02:37:31.008]  And the guy just, just is like a flaming candy ass.
[02:37:31.008 --> 02:37:36.813]  And it just seems to go with the territory with these type of sellouts and sycophants.
[02:37:36.813 --> 02:37:38.594]  Now, humor me, Dr. Pachenik.
[02:37:40.378 --> 02:37:46.390]  Before you get into Trump and where you see this going and what's happening, I didn't bring up...
[02:37:47.654 --> 02:37:55.801]  You know, the Russians, when I'm supposed to do an interview with them, bringing you up, or I didn't bring up the CIA, you know, visiting or whatever, you know, to act impressive on air, obviously.
[02:37:55.801 --> 02:38:02.788]  I want folks to know how real this is and that a show like this could actually have them all shook up and not knowing what to do and Hillary attacking me.
[02:38:02.788 --> 02:38:05.170]  I think that speaks to weakness, not our strength.
[02:38:05.170 --> 02:38:13.377]  And so I was just wanted you to talk to specifically the battlefield right now, globally, who some of the factions are and where you see this going.
[02:38:14.324 --> 02:38:18.509]  Let's just hypothetically say Trump doesn't get in, which I think he will if he plays his cards right.
[02:38:18.509 --> 02:38:20.051]  He's on the wave of a populist movement.
[02:38:20.854 --> 02:38:23.636]  But like you said, if he starts waffling, why does it matter?
[02:38:23.636 --> 02:38:29.540]  Maybe it's better Hillary gets in if she's collapsing, looks completely mentally ill, though that's dangerous.
[02:38:29.540 --> 02:38:31.961]  Maybe that totally discredits these people once and for all.
[02:38:31.961 --> 02:38:36.164]  They were so arrogant, they forced another Bush-slash-Clinton dynasty in.
[02:38:36.164 --> 02:38:39.486]  I mean, just how do you see the tea leaves, basically, is what I'm getting at.
[02:38:39.486 --> 02:38:49.012]  And why is the power structure openly saying now they want to censor everything, which seems to be a really desperate move, showing they know they're in major decline?
[02:38:49.608 --> 02:38:52.552]  Well, I think you've said it very clearly, Alex.
[02:38:52.552 --> 02:38:58.240]  The power structure, not only here but all over the world, is unified in one element.
[02:38:58.240 --> 02:39:00.904]  They are afraid of this.
[02:39:00.904 --> 02:39:02.025]  We're outliers.
[02:39:02.025 --> 02:39:03.427]  We're the black swan.
[02:39:03.427 --> 02:39:06.652]  You were the black swan on radio and on the internet.
[02:39:07.192 --> 02:39:16.078]  Ironically, I was the black swan in writing about cyber-terrorism, cyber-nation 20, 30 years ago under the Clancy franchise.
[02:39:16.078 --> 02:39:24.122]  So what they were afraid of is that the words we speak, they're quite accurate.
[02:39:24.122 --> 02:39:28.105]  More often than not, we tend to be very accurate in our predictions.
[02:39:28.105 --> 02:39:31.007]  I don't say my predictions, but our predictions.
[02:39:31.007 --> 02:39:36.430]  As you said, a year ago, many years ago, I brought up the issue of the Pope repeatedly.
[02:39:36.970 --> 02:39:46.199]  I accuse the Pope, as a physician, of complicity in the murder and torture of Catholics in Argentina who disappeared.
[02:39:46.199 --> 02:39:47.740]  Now that was over a year and a half ago.
[02:39:47.740 --> 02:39:52.365]  That's correct, as well as the Jesuits and nuns who were killed by the Colonel.
[02:39:52.365 --> 02:39:54.146]  And now he's speaking probably about you!
[02:39:54.987 --> 02:39:59.669]  When he says conspiracy theorist journalists must be shut down.
[02:39:59.669 --> 02:40:04.171]  And I went, attended Catholic churches in Albi, in Toulouse.
[02:40:04.171 --> 02:40:23.840]  But the second part is that I accused the Clinton administration and the Obama administration of such massive corruption that James Comey is sitting there like a fool, a moron, and a pathetic idiot who can't answer a simple question that's given to him, why did you
[02:40:24.540 --> 02:40:26.282]  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
[02:40:33.272 --> 02:40:40.454]  No, not Loretta Lynch, but the Chief of Staff for Hillary, who was also in his law firm.
[02:40:40.454 --> 02:40:51.417]  So the corruption of Lynch, the corruption of Brennan, the corruption of our military, all lies within the system of Obama, Clinton, and the Bushes.
[02:40:51.417 --> 02:40:52.877]  Cheryl Mills or Shultz?
[02:40:52.877 --> 02:40:53.697]  Cheryl Mills.
[02:40:53.697 --> 02:40:57.839]  Cheryl Mills was in the same law firm as Comey.
[02:40:57.839 --> 02:40:59.359]  He should have recused himself.
[02:40:59.899 --> 02:41:01.820]  He and she were in the same boat.
[02:41:01.820 --> 02:41:06.362]  As a psychological warfare expert, one of the leading ones out there, stop for a moment, daughter.
[02:41:06.362 --> 02:41:07.342]  That's what I mean.
[02:41:07.342 --> 02:41:12.604]  As a top psychiatrist looking at this, because as a layperson, it's like Emperor's New Clothes.
[02:41:12.604 --> 02:41:15.525]  Don't they get they're burning themselves down in front of everyone?
[02:41:15.525 --> 02:41:21.948]  Yes, but with all due respect, Alex, what happens when you have massive self-destructive behavior?
[02:41:21.948 --> 02:41:22.828]  That's what you've seen.
[02:41:23.628 --> 02:41:35.335]  Comey was put on the spot, thank God, by our Congressional operatives and our Congressmen who said correctly, why are you offering immunity?
[02:41:35.335 --> 02:41:37.497]  Why have you not followed through?
[02:41:37.497 --> 02:41:39.378]  And Comey cannot answer the questions.
[02:41:40.398 --> 02:41:42.959]  And he can't answer it because he's lying.
[02:41:42.959 --> 02:41:52.862]  He knows he came to that position as a result of collusive behavior, compromising his integrity, and compromising the integrity of the FBI.
[02:41:52.862 --> 02:41:55.683]  John Brennan compromised himself long ago.
[02:41:55.683 --> 02:41:58.463]  He was known as a secondary operative.
[02:41:58.463 --> 02:42:00.124]  He was really an analyst.
[02:42:00.124 --> 02:42:03.725]  In the intelligence community, Brennan was not considered very bright.
[02:42:04.225 --> 02:42:06.247]  So who brought him up?
[02:42:06.247 --> 02:42:09.291]  The Bushes and the Clintons because they could manipulate him.
[02:42:09.291 --> 02:42:15.798]  Remember, a system of politics depends on vulnerability and pandering, not incompetency.
[02:42:16.380 --> 02:42:19.161]  You and I have to depend on competency.
[02:42:19.161 --> 02:42:21.922]  The American public has to depend on competency.
[02:42:21.922 --> 02:42:22.963]  They don't pander.
[02:42:22.963 --> 02:42:23.343]  That's right.
[02:42:23.343 --> 02:42:24.744]  We've got to make our kids lunches.
[02:42:24.744 --> 02:42:25.584]  We've got to pick them up.
[02:42:25.584 --> 02:42:26.885]  We've got to pay the bills.
[02:42:26.885 --> 02:42:29.846]  We've got to change the cat box.
[02:42:29.846 --> 02:42:31.167]  We've got to take the dog for a walk.
[02:42:31.167 --> 02:42:32.267]  We've got to pay the taxes.
[02:42:32.267 --> 02:42:33.287]  We've got to show up.
[02:42:33.287 --> 02:42:36.229]  They just sit up there and... Why do you think... I asked a question earlier.
[02:42:37.253 --> 02:42:39.235]  I have all these clips we can play, but I'm sure you've seen them.
[02:42:39.235 --> 02:42:50.823]  This new thing where they go on TV and laugh about how dumb we are, and admit they're lying to us, and celebrate it on Charlie Rose, celebrate it on C-SPAN, celebrate it and say, thank God we're dumb.
[02:42:50.823 --> 02:42:52.024]  What is that?
[02:42:52.024 --> 02:42:57.088]  Well, all that is, is fear and a secondary issue.
[02:42:57.088 --> 02:43:01.711]  It's a distraction from the main issue where they realize they're highly vulnerable.
[02:43:01.711 --> 02:43:03.292]  So that's them acting confident.
[02:43:03.292 --> 02:43:04.914]  That's them whistling past the graveyard.
[02:43:04.914 --> 02:43:06.515]  Is that them whistling past the graveyard?
[02:43:06.877 --> 02:43:12.959]  Well, it's not only whistling past the graveyard, they're in the process of self-destructing and they don't know what to do.
[02:43:12.959 --> 02:43:15.000]  They don't know how to strike out.
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:31.166]  In the same way that Trump should have hit Hillary about her father, who was a Jew, didn't like the fact he was a Jew, changing his name to Rodham, was a man who abused her physically and mentally, as well as her mother, and never made a penny.
[02:43:31.166 --> 02:43:34.447]  Let's talk about the CIA file on Hillary, her real background.
[02:43:34.447 --> 02:43:35.067]  Let's talk about that.
[02:43:36.015 --> 02:43:40.900]  Well, the CIA file on Hillary is that I wouldn't be surprised, quite frankly.
[02:43:40.900 --> 02:43:41.840]  I don't want to say this again.
[02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:44.643]  We don't want to get the Justice Department in here, but let's just not play games.
[02:43:44.643 --> 02:43:46.084]  Let's just get it out.
[02:43:46.084 --> 02:43:47.586]  Well, there's no playing games.
[02:43:47.586 --> 02:43:52.270]  The problem is... No, I'm not saying you are, but let's... As a psychiatrist, what do you... I mean, we know about her history.
[02:43:52.270 --> 02:43:54.232]  We know her dad was a mob boss in Chicago.
[02:43:54.232 --> 02:43:55.373]  We know he was Jewish.
[02:43:55.373 --> 02:43:56.254]  You're half-Jewish.
[02:43:56.254 --> 02:43:57.475]  You've got nothing wrong with that.
[02:43:57.475 --> 02:43:58.596]  She's not... She's ashamed of that.
[02:43:58.596 --> 02:43:59.977]  I'd be proud of it if I was her.
[02:43:59.977 --> 02:44:01.799]  And let's talk about why she's so mentally ill.
[02:44:03.542 --> 02:44:11.751]  She's ill right now because she came to the point in her life where physically and mentally she has self-destructed.
[02:44:11.751 --> 02:44:13.232]  She has Parkinsonism.
[02:44:13.232 --> 02:44:15.895]  It's an issue of neurological damage.
[02:44:15.895 --> 02:44:19.099]  It's been there for years, four to five years.
[02:44:19.099 --> 02:44:21.882]  Columbia Physician and Surgeons has the record.
[02:44:22.382 --> 02:44:24.583]  They have the neurological evaluation.
[02:44:24.583 --> 02:44:26.863]  They have the CAT scans, the MRIs.
[02:44:26.863 --> 02:44:33.045]  She picked a little doctor who attended my Cornell Medical College, and she lied, this doctor.
[02:44:33.045 --> 02:44:35.245]  But Columbia has all of the records.
[02:44:35.245 --> 02:44:36.466]  We don't see MRIs.
[02:44:36.466 --> 02:44:38.306]  We don't see the CAT scans.
[02:44:38.306 --> 02:44:40.987]  And she's trying to lie her way to the presidency.
[02:44:41.787 --> 02:44:45.188]  She may get there, because if Trump fails, it'll fail because of Trump.
[02:44:45.188 --> 02:44:46.688]  We're going to get to that, I promise, in a moment.
[02:44:46.688 --> 02:44:50.269]  But specifically then, let me just ask this question because I found it so interesting.
[02:44:50.269 --> 02:44:51.049]  I mean, that happened.
[02:44:51.049 --> 02:44:54.329]  In fact, some of the people were in the office and they saw it and they were like, this is a TV show.
[02:44:54.329 --> 02:45:03.491]  Why do you think the Russians, before I was never allowed basically back on RT again, unless I was a guest on another show or say a documentary interviewed me, I don't care about RT, big deal.
[02:45:03.491 --> 02:45:06.872]  The point is, is they wanted me on all the time, and then after there was this meeting,
[02:45:07.432 --> 02:45:13.574]  And it wasn't RT and it was like this Russian government and people interrogated me for like 20 minutes and I was just like, this is an interview.
[02:45:13.574 --> 02:45:18.895]  They kept asking about you and then they basically thought I was some operative or something, which I'm not.
[02:45:18.895 --> 02:45:20.415]  I'm proud of the fact I'm organic, folks.
[02:45:20.415 --> 02:45:22.856]  I'm proud that I haven't been part of some agency.
[02:45:22.856 --> 02:45:24.356]  I'm not saying it's bad if you've been.
[02:45:24.356 --> 02:45:27.377]  They were obsessed with you and really were acting like you were Godzilla or something.
[02:45:27.657 --> 02:45:29.440]  Well, here's the problem.
[02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:43.098]  The Russians knew very well that I worked in the Soviet Union to take them apart from the 1960s, thanks to Nixon, where I was sent overseas and started working in the Russian Soviet psychiatric hospitals.
[02:45:43.098 --> 02:45:44.140]  I was taking out
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:45.261]  Thank you.
[02:45:59.884 --> 02:46:02.485]  Why is that so important, getting people out of countries?
[02:46:02.485 --> 02:46:20.849]  Because I know that was... Because it was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union, I had developed a plan which systematically was able to work on the fact that there were Christians who were defying the atheist ideology of communism, and in turn they were put in psychiatric hospitals.
[02:46:21.369 --> 02:46:38.024]  So I had the credibility as a psychiatrist to go in there, and I literally commoditized these Christians by saying to one of Stalin's men, who was the last man available, a doctor, I will give you Wang computers, X number of Wang computers, for this person, that person, that person.
[02:46:38.024 --> 02:46:40.286]  They all turned out to be major Christians.
[02:46:40.286 --> 02:46:44.290]  In turn, we began to take down the system little by little.
[02:46:44.290 --> 02:46:44.750]  Oh, I get it.
[02:46:44.750 --> 02:46:47.613]  By spreading the word that the Christians could reactivate inside Russia.
[02:46:47.853 --> 02:47:04.810]  Correct, but the second part was the fact that I knew their KGB was highly compromised, and I could buy off many of their operatives, including the GRU, the KGB, and other elements by helping... It was just weird because they were interrogating me, and I said, this isn't a TV interview, is it?
[02:47:04.810 --> 02:47:06.872]  And they're like, Pachinik, why does he talk to you?
[02:47:06.872 --> 02:47:07.873]  What is Pachinik doing?
[02:47:08.513 --> 02:47:11.954]  Yeah, and so I thought it was very, very interesting that they're definitely obsessed with you.
[02:47:11.954 --> 02:47:13.355]  Well, they are obsessed with me.
[02:47:13.355 --> 02:47:18.937]  Putin, to this day, wants to know how I took him out of the Soviet Union, and he's not going to know that.
[02:47:18.937 --> 02:47:26.460]  But I do have respect for him in terms of the fact he has to do what he's doing, but he cannot continue in Syria to kill those people.
[02:47:26.460 --> 02:47:27.801]  That's a warning to Putin.
[02:47:28.181 --> 02:47:40.127]  That's the beginning of the end of Putin, and I'm saying to him very clearly, you have problems within the Kremlin, you have the FSB, you have the SUV, and you know very well that we can put them into spin.
[02:47:40.127 --> 02:47:44.109]  And that means that Putin understands that he can't trust anyone.
[02:47:44.109 --> 02:47:50.613]  And that's exactly what we did, or I did, years ago with several of Brezhnev and Yeltsin and others.
[02:47:51.313 --> 02:47:56.077]  I was trained by our military and by my intelligence service.
[02:47:56.077 --> 02:47:58.298]  My dedication is to this country.
[02:47:58.298 --> 02:47:59.559]  I do not ask for promotions.
[02:47:59.559 --> 02:48:01.701]  They asked me to be promoted to a Rear Admiral at 39.
[02:48:14.990 --> 02:48:15.991]  I turned it down.
[02:48:15.991 --> 02:48:17.572]  They asked me to get a pension.
[02:48:17.572 --> 02:48:18.893]  I turned it down.
[02:48:18.893 --> 02:48:19.994]  I did not have money.
[02:48:19.994 --> 02:48:21.936]  I wasn't being cavalier.
[02:48:21.936 --> 02:48:31.524]  I simply wanted to serve the country, to thank this country for taking me in as a refugee and allowing me to be everything I could be and fail.
[02:48:31.524 --> 02:48:33.766]  And that was the beauty of what I did.
[02:48:33.766 --> 02:48:35.307]  So they had no hold on me.
[02:48:35.307 --> 02:48:36.288]  No, no, we're going to break.
[02:48:36.288 --> 02:48:40.051]  I'm going to come back and get your message, what you think Trump should do in the next debate.
[02:48:40.051 --> 02:48:42.794]  But specifically though, the only reason we bring this up
[02:48:44.174 --> 02:48:53.697]  Is the battlefield spectrum, I know the police are somewhat awake, the military is awake, a lot of people, I never want to make the government like the good guys, but it seems like government people are more awake than the general public.
[02:48:53.697 --> 02:48:59.959]  The arrogance of trying to put Hillary in, the rotting political system, how would you describe the political climate right now?
[02:49:00.623 --> 02:49:01.844]  It's totally corrupt.
[02:49:01.844 --> 02:49:05.627]  It is so self-destructive and it's irrelevant.
[02:49:05.627 --> 02:49:15.575]  What's happening right now is, as I went through the nation, the different states, it was clear to me, as I've said for a long time, Washington is irrelevant.
[02:49:15.575 --> 02:49:16.176]  They know it.
[02:49:16.176 --> 02:49:17.056]  They're irrelevant.
[02:49:17.056 --> 02:49:21.580]  So they're trying to create false flags, which we had in Sandy Hook and all that other nonsense.
[02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:23.782]  In order to make themselves relevant.
[02:49:23.782 --> 02:49:26.003]  The FBI has become irrelevant.
[02:49:26.003 --> 02:49:28.365]  The CIA has become irrelevant.
[02:49:28.365 --> 02:49:36.612]  In fact, what's becoming more and more relevant are people who are staying home, doing cyber security, and doing internet work.
[02:49:36.612 --> 02:49:48.282]  What's happening in our country is we're transforming from an industrial state to an information age, and we're trying to compete with a massive Chinese economic engine, not military.
[02:49:48.322 --> 02:49:56.426]  And because the globalists shut down our economy to sell it off, they've actually forced us to morph and create new economies the central system can't control.
[02:49:56.426 --> 02:49:58.206]  Well, there is no more central system.
[02:49:58.206 --> 02:50:03.389]  With all due respect, the globalists have finished the beginning and that's why I support... That's what I wanted to say!
[02:50:03.389 --> 02:50:05.209]  They expected this whole world government.
[02:50:05.209 --> 02:50:06.530]  It's already falling apart.
[02:50:06.530 --> 02:50:08.611]  Every EU country is leaving.
[02:50:09.051 --> 02:50:09.792]  It's fallen.
[02:50:09.792 --> 02:50:23.888]  One of the things you and I were successful in doing is when we supported the movement for Catalan to break away from Spain, for England to break away from EU, and for Scotland to break away from England was the beginning of the end of EU.
[02:50:24.008 --> 02:50:27.571]  And by the way, I'm not bragging, but I've talked to Farage at dinner and on air.
[02:50:27.571 --> 02:50:33.557]  He admitted that UKIP was nothing until 15 years ago, and that most of their new members were from this show, people listening over there.
[02:50:33.557 --> 02:50:39.342]  I don't want to give us credit, but it's actually crazy that he will tell you that UKIP got its main push from InfoWars.
[02:50:39.662 --> 02:50:40.743]  That's correct.
[02:50:40.743 --> 02:50:41.983]  I wasn't kidding you.
[02:50:41.983 --> 02:50:43.844]  It came out of here.
[02:50:43.844 --> 02:50:47.486]  You and I kept discussing it and you would ask me what was happening.
[02:50:47.486 --> 02:50:51.809]  I remember you said five years ago, watch, nationalist movements breaking away, the EU's done.
[02:50:51.809 --> 02:50:54.390]  And I actually didn't, I thought you were being too confident.
[02:50:54.390 --> 02:50:55.510]  That's what's crazy, Doc.
[02:50:55.510 --> 02:50:56.811]  This is really happening.
[02:50:56.811 --> 02:50:57.792]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:57.792 --> 02:50:58.652]  You're part of it.
[02:50:58.652 --> 02:50:59.633]  I know, it's amazing.
[02:50:59.633 --> 02:50:59.953]  Stay there.
[02:51:02.694 --> 02:51:06.856]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[02:51:06.856 --> 02:51:13.058]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[02:51:13.058 --> 02:51:14.819]  How is this even possible?
[02:51:14.819 --> 02:51:22.362]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[02:51:22.362 --> 02:51:30.105]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[02:51:30.325 --> 02:51:34.687]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[02:51:34.687 --> 02:51:43.452]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[02:51:43.452 --> 02:51:45.033]  But you must act fast.
[02:51:45.033 --> 02:51:49.575]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard, our supply is extremely limited right now.
[02:51:49.855 --> 02:51:55.799]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[02:51:55.799 --> 02:51:59.241]  That's Greens75.com.
[02:51:59.241 --> 02:52:02.183]  Greens75.com.
[02:52:02.183 --> 02:52:03.284]  Think about this.
[02:52:03.284 --> 02:52:10.869]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia.
[02:52:11.089 --> 02:52:15.850]  Chlorine and chloramines in pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[02:52:15.850 --> 02:52:20.111]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[02:52:20.111 --> 02:52:23.952]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey water filter.
[02:52:23.952 --> 02:52:34.834]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show Big Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[02:52:44.280 --> 02:52:45.001]  Big Berkey.
[02:52:45.001 --> 02:52:48.103]  The one powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[02:52:53.546 --> 02:52:54.427]  For the love of clean water.
[02:53:02.082 --> 02:53:05.965]  In a crisis, your number one need is food, but not just any food.
[02:53:05.965 --> 02:53:12.630]  Experts say everyone needs to have non-perishable, good-for-25-years survival food on hand in case of an emergency.
[02:53:12.630 --> 02:53:20.996]  Well, right now, in what is truly an unprecedented move, 72-hour survival food kits are being given away to listeners while supplies last.
[02:53:20.996 --> 02:53:26.480]  Survival food is more important today than ever before, explains Frank Bates, a spokesman for the company.
[02:53:26.480 --> 02:53:30.343]  Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other threats can make obtaining sufficient food
[02:53:30.723 --> 02:53:32.764]  Impossible in an emergency.
[02:53:32.764 --> 02:53:38.906]  This 72-hour survival kit has 16 servings of delicious food, rated for 25 years of storage.
[02:53:38.906 --> 02:53:47.269]  It sells to the general public for $27 plus shipping, and it's been rated 4.5 out of 5 stars by customers who paid full price.
[02:53:47.269 --> 02:53:51.951]  But listeners who act quickly can get it free, just cover $9.95 shipping.

[02:53:54.292 --> 02:53:57.193]  Supplies are limited and the program may end at any time.

[02:53:59.595 --> 02:54:00.606]  That's FreeFood2.com!
[02:54:16.428 --> 02:54:18.449]  There's all these sociopaths.
[02:54:18.449 --> 02:54:20.550]  People that really aren't even sociopathic, but they act like it.
[02:54:20.550 --> 02:54:23.351]  A lot of them care at some level.
[02:54:23.351 --> 02:54:30.093]  They think screwing everyone over and only caring about what you're getting today is what a winner does.
[02:54:30.093 --> 02:54:32.454]  No, that's not what builds civilization.
[02:54:32.454 --> 02:54:37.396]  And I can tell you unequivocally that they're coming to the end of their road.
[02:54:37.396 --> 02:54:40.497]  We've got six minutes with Dr. Buchanan, then five more, and then I'm going to have
[02:54:41.969 --> 02:54:45.812]  Anthony Cumia, who's an amazing talk show host, obviously taken over.
[02:54:45.812 --> 02:54:49.815]  He got kicked off for speaking out against Black Lives Matter and the rest of it of his Top XM show.
[02:54:52.342 --> 02:54:57.185]  Specifically, you know, what Trump should do.
[02:54:57.185 --> 02:54:59.426]  Trump, I mean, I don't know what's going on with Trump.
[02:54:59.426 --> 02:55:03.329]  I mean, I think he was trying to be nice to a lady, trying to be chivalrous.
[02:55:03.329 --> 02:55:04.349]  But the truth's the truth.
[02:55:04.349 --> 02:55:06.130]  Heavens may fall.
[02:55:06.130 --> 02:55:08.111]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[02:55:08.111 --> 02:55:13.895]  And so what would you specifically do if you're Donald Trump and you're in the next debate with Hillary Clinton?
[02:55:15.089 --> 02:55:16.050]  It's very simple.
[02:55:16.050 --> 02:55:21.494]  Number one, he stated in the beginning that in thirty years she has done nothing.
[02:55:21.494 --> 02:55:30.800]  And he has to go into detail to explain that she did nothing when she collated and culled together a bunch of people to create a health program.
[02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:31.881]  That was a disaster.
[02:55:31.881 --> 02:55:34.202]  The children's program was a disaster.
[02:55:34.202 --> 02:55:41.728]  He has to go into detail how she did go into Iraq, but more importantly, he has to go into detail how she attempted to
[02:55:42.428 --> 02:55:49.190]  Say that she brought in jobs for people in New York State, and as a senator she accomplished less than nothing.
[02:55:49.190 --> 02:56:00.473]  Made huge promises, as he said, and go into detail to show that the fact that the end of her tenure was a minus- And you turned Libya over to Al Qaeda and ISIS, absolutely so.
[02:56:00.473 --> 02:56:02.594]  Well, and then she didn't go into ISIS.
[02:56:02.594 --> 02:56:07.495]  He said it correctly that Al Qaeda and and ISIS was the result of her
[02:56:08.095 --> 02:56:09.636]  Because she didn't care!
[02:56:09.636 --> 02:56:12.298]  She was just being paid by foreign powers to sell us out!
[02:56:36.522 --> 02:56:42.308]  Well, that's part of it, but I don't want him to get into a tit-for-tat fight.
[02:56:42.308 --> 02:56:43.930]  At the same time, he can explain.
[02:56:43.930 --> 02:56:46.633]  He can just say, you're the past, I'm the future.
[02:56:46.633 --> 02:56:48.855]  You represent everything everyone hates.
[02:56:48.855 --> 02:56:51.037]  That's exactly the point.
[02:56:51.037 --> 02:56:53.339]  You are the past, I am the future.
[02:56:53.339 --> 02:56:54.521]  You couldn't have said it better.
[02:56:55.081 --> 02:56:55.802]  I think so.
[02:57:11.315 --> 02:57:16.799]  Because not one of our presidents in the past 30 to 40 years has ever had a job.
[02:57:16.799 --> 02:57:18.661]  Neither Clinton, Bill Clinton, Bush Jr., Obama.
[02:57:18.661 --> 02:57:19.942]  They've never had a job.
[02:57:19.942 --> 02:57:20.943]  Well, but the contrary.
[02:57:20.943 --> 02:57:22.824]  He has to show how important it has been
[02:57:29.509 --> 02:57:32.771]  To be able to read a balance sheet, a P.L.
[02:57:32.771 --> 02:57:41.716]  statement, and not defend himself, the fact that he had $635 million in debt against an asset that's worth $10 billion.
[02:57:41.716 --> 02:57:44.317]  He's correct, but the people don't understand that.
[02:57:44.317 --> 02:57:48.059]  Nor does he have to be caught into the tax issue.
[02:57:48.059 --> 02:57:48.580]  Exactly!
[02:57:48.580 --> 02:57:55.684]  Most of my company is in the black, but there are areas that are in debt because that's part of the plan to pay it off.
[02:57:55.684 --> 02:57:58.025]  But the general public doesn't understand that.
[02:57:58.485 --> 02:58:01.347]  No, but you can't teach the general public everything.
[02:58:01.347 --> 02:58:08.153]  What you can show is that Hillary has no idea of business, and she has to go into that system.
[02:58:08.153 --> 02:58:10.335]  Yeah, she just goes and raises taxes and gets more money.
[02:58:11.775 --> 02:58:13.175]  She just goes and just takes people's money.
[02:58:13.175 --> 02:58:14.276]  Well, she has no idea.
[02:58:14.276 --> 02:58:15.756]  She has no real strategy.
[02:58:15.756 --> 02:58:21.678]  In fact, her whole team is really nothing more than sycophants whom I've known for 20, 30 years.
[02:58:21.678 --> 02:58:24.338]  Second-tier quality.
[02:58:24.338 --> 02:58:26.319]  They're not really very good.
[02:58:26.319 --> 02:58:28.759]  They're Al Gore spinoffs, or they're Carter.
[02:58:28.759 --> 02:58:29.420]  All right, stay there.
[02:58:29.420 --> 02:58:30.220]  Five more minutes, sir.
[02:58:30.220 --> 02:58:31.300]  SteveMachinick.com.
[02:58:31.300 --> 02:58:34.241]  So the issue here is then, in far... We gotta go to break.
[02:58:34.241 --> 02:58:34.821]  We gotta go to break.
[02:58:34.821 --> 02:58:35.801]  Back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:35.801 --> 02:58:37.142]  Five more minutes on the other side.
[02:58:37.142 --> 02:58:37.742]  I want to ask you...
[02:58:38.522 --> 02:58:42.004]  To put a bow on this, but what will Hillary do if she gets in?
[02:58:42.004 --> 02:58:43.025]  39 days out, folks.

[02:59:49.386 --> 02:59:50.687]  Check it out for yourself today.
[02:59:54.443 --> 03:00:06.786]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:06.786 --> 03:00:16.508]  Welcome back, final segment, Dr. Pachinik, the Nancy Akumi is coming up.
[03:00:16.508 --> 03:00:20.469]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:25.675 --> 03:00:27.276]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:00:27.276 --> 03:00:45.029]  Last time he was on, he quoted a quote, and I wanted to look it up, and it was Otto von Bismarck that basically unified Germany, and he said, God has a special providence, that means good luck, or a upper hand, God has a special providence for fools, drunkards, and the United States of America.
[03:00:46.178 --> 03:00:48.179]  And that's been pointed out for a couple hundred years.
[03:00:48.179 --> 03:00:50.000]  We've had unbelievable good luck.
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:51.761]  Just really magic things happen.
[03:00:51.761 --> 03:00:53.981]  I think we're losing that luck now, because this isn't America.
[03:00:53.981 --> 03:00:57.923]  We've been overrun by criminals, and we have to show we have courage.
[03:00:57.923 --> 03:01:01.985]  That's why I think God really loves people that have courage, and who want people to be individuals and have free will.
[03:01:01.985 --> 03:01:04.806]  And Dr. Pchenik, in closing, thanks for all you do.
[03:01:04.806 --> 03:01:05.547]  Really appreciate it.
[03:01:05.547 --> 03:01:06.987]  I wasn't trying to toot our horn last hour.
[03:01:06.987 --> 03:01:08.468]  I just want listeners to understand that
[03:01:08.988 --> 03:01:11.390]  It's not that we're that strong, they're there that weak.
[03:01:11.390 --> 03:01:15.592]  We just have to understand that we have to move forward and have confidence to really change this.
[03:01:15.592 --> 03:01:19.495]  But finishing up, what are you looking for in the next 39 days?
[03:01:19.495 --> 03:01:22.897]  Let's just hypothetically, if Hillary gets in, what do you see happening there?
[03:01:22.897 --> 03:01:26.660]  I mean, I think their incompetence is really the most frightening thing I could imagine.
[03:01:27.099 --> 03:01:27.799]  You're correct.
[03:01:27.799 --> 03:01:34.123]  It's a combination between her illness, the incompetency, and the fact that they have to buttress her up.
[03:01:34.123 --> 03:01:41.146]  So you will see a lot of movement in the beginning and a lot of payoffs in terms of what will happen.
[03:01:41.146 --> 03:01:43.407]  But she will not make it through the first year.
[03:01:43.407 --> 03:01:46.909]  She will probably die within that first year or so.
[03:01:46.909 --> 03:01:49.711]  She's not physically fit to handle it, nor mentally.
[03:01:49.711 --> 03:01:53.733]  So what we have is a real problem for our intelligence and military community.
[03:01:54.473 --> 03:01:58.676]  Well, they just have a big power struggle and hope she's an invalid, so...
[03:02:23.511 --> 03:02:31.378]  Well, it's not only an invalid, it'll be kind of a Woodrow Wilson situation where you won't see her and that's exactly what you're seeing now.
[03:02:31.378 --> 03:02:33.640]  She's totally absent from the field.
[03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:35.502]  She can't handle most of the issues.
[03:02:35.502 --> 03:02:39.746]  And that further discredits the government as the media lies and says she's fine, she's climbing Mount Everest.
[03:02:40.146 --> 03:02:40.846]  Correct.
[03:02:40.846 --> 03:02:43.287]  And so, that will be a disconnect.
[03:02:43.287 --> 03:02:49.368]  But it'll depend on our military and our intelligence services to determine what it is that they want to do.
[03:02:49.368 --> 03:02:52.828]  On one side, you have Michael Flynn on the Trump side.
[03:02:52.828 --> 03:02:55.669]  On the other side, you have Michael Hayden.
[03:02:55.669 --> 03:02:57.569]  Both are quite qualified.
[03:02:57.569 --> 03:02:59.829]  They come out of the military intelligence.
[03:02:59.829 --> 03:03:04.690]  I know both of these guys not well, but enough to know that they're competent.
[03:03:04.690 --> 03:03:09.711]  The secondary issue is America has to understand we continue, no matter who's on the top.
[03:03:10.352 --> 03:03:12.216]  And no one can defeat us.
[03:03:12.216 --> 03:03:18.549]  And really what we have to do is to continue to devolve that power to the local level, to the state level.
[03:03:18.549 --> 03:03:20.433]  Where the real engine of prosperity is.
[03:03:21.013 --> 03:03:36.369]  Well, the real engine of prosperity, quite frankly, is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in the past two and a half weeks traveling 4,000 miles, is the intermodal traffic systems that I've seen trucking between the trains, the ships, and our trucks.
[03:03:36.369 --> 03:03:37.971]  We're a formidable country.
[03:03:37.971 --> 03:03:42.556]  Sure, even though the trains weren't upgraded, Eisenhower's plan with the roads really sets us apart.
[03:03:42.816 --> 03:03:43.917]  That's correct.
[03:03:43.917 --> 03:03:47.041]  The genius of Eisenhower has still not been appreciated.
[03:03:47.041 --> 03:03:54.669]  A man stopped the war in Korea, he built our roads, and warned us that the military-industrial complex, that's what we need right now.
[03:03:54.669 --> 03:03:56.410]  We need another Eisenhower.
[03:03:56.410 --> 03:04:01.436]  Can Trump- And he built the roads not just for the economy, but nobody could ever invade and win after those roads were built.
[03:04:01.736 --> 03:04:03.097]  Well, nobody did invade us.
[03:04:03.097 --> 03:04:09.462]  The only people who invaded us was Bush and Clinton and the internal... That's it?
[03:04:09.462 --> 03:04:11.924]  And that's why they claim that I'm a Russian agent or whatever?
[03:04:11.924 --> 03:04:13.124]  Because I don't want World War III?
[03:04:13.124 --> 03:04:16.267]  No, they can claim whatever they want, but calling us... Well, what do you make of that?
[03:04:16.267 --> 03:04:19.089]  I mean, in 30 seconds, what do you make of this ridiculous thing that Trump's a Russian agent?
[03:04:19.662 --> 03:04:20.642]  That's absurd.
[03:04:20.642 --> 03:04:23.583]  He's no more a Russian agent, and Hillary's a Russian agent.
[03:04:23.583 --> 03:04:25.944]  Both do businesses with Russia.
[03:04:25.944 --> 03:04:29.485]  Podesta, who's the right-hand man to Hillary and is totally corrupt.
[03:04:29.485 --> 03:04:36.526]  The Podesta group does business with Russia, Ukraine, and so does Manafort, and so does Trump.
[03:04:36.526 --> 03:04:37.967]  So that's equal.
[03:04:37.967 --> 03:04:39.427]  That's not the issue anymore.
[03:04:39.427 --> 03:04:41.428]  Alright, Dr. Puccini, always informative.
[03:04:41.428 --> 03:04:42.268]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:42.768 --> 03:04:45.310]  Pleasure and God bless you.
[03:04:45.310 --> 03:04:46.351]  God bless you.
[03:04:46.351 --> 03:04:51.075]  I'm going to punch out Anthony Cumia coming up hosting the fourth hour straight ahead.
[03:04:51.075 --> 03:04:53.357]  Big syndicated talk show host in his own right.
[03:04:53.357 --> 03:04:54.338]  Always informative.
[03:04:54.338 --> 03:04:58.462]  Looking forward to watching this in my office as I take care of business.
[03:04:58.462 --> 03:04:59.683]  Here he is straight ahead in three minutes.
[03:05:02.165 --> 03:05:10.249]  It's only recently that Trump has mainstreamed the term globalist so effectively that they can no longer hide from the label, but they still try to hide their true agenda.
[03:05:10.249 --> 03:05:17.613]  The Christian Post pointed out that globalism is a secular, humanistic religion of sorts that envisions a one-world government.
[03:05:17.613 --> 03:05:18.614]  An American Thinker article
[03:05:18.954 --> 03:05:31.851]  Title Globalism the Religion of Empire says the religion of globalism sees an earthly utopian world order in which all men pay allegiance to elite priests who rule over a world city without national borders.
[03:05:31.851 --> 03:05:34.394]  The globalists will erase not only geographical borders
[03:05:34.574 --> 03:05:38.095]  But the boundaries on how government will intrude into your life.
[03:05:38.095 --> 03:05:41.936]  You can forget the First Amendment and the rest of the Bill of Rights if they succeed.
[03:05:41.936 --> 03:05:50.599]  Even those like Jeremy Rabkin, who don't support Trump, see that the globalists seek to, quote, organize the world in a way that establishes an artificial consensus.
[03:05:50.599 --> 03:05:52.519]  It's not enough to say it's undemocratic.
[03:05:52.519 --> 03:05:53.540]  It's threatening.
[03:05:53.540 --> 03:05:54.800]  It's almost demonic.
[03:05:54.800 --> 03:05:59.881]  It is a world organized independently of people's fundamental religious convictions.
[03:05:59.881 --> 03:06:01.562]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:06:02.122 --> 03:06:02.922]  Hey, everyone.
[03:06:02.922 --> 03:06:05.224]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[03:06:05.224 --> 03:06:09.066]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:06:09.066 --> 03:06:11.147]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:06:11.147 --> 03:06:21.413]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:06:21.413 --> 03:06:27.396]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:06:27.856 --> 03:06:42.773]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[03:06:42.833 --> 03:06:43.294]  Thank you.
[03:07:02.518 --> 03:07:03.959]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:07:03.959 --> 03:07:05.280]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:07:05.280 --> 03:07:06.481]  Why is this so good?
[03:07:06.481 --> 03:07:11.766]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:07:11.766 --> 03:07:25.319]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:07:25.319 --> 03:07:26.680]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:07:27.461 --> 03:07:29.102]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:07:29.102 --> 03:07:31.602]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:07:31.602 --> 03:07:32.983]  These are all parasites.
[03:07:32.983 --> 03:07:34.083]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:07:34.083 --> 03:07:35.424]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:07:35.424 --> 03:07:39.925]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:07:39.925 --> 03:07:43.066]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:07:43.166 --> 03:07:46.208]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:07:46.208 --> 03:07:47.309]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:07:47.309 --> 03:07:49.230]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:49.230 --> 03:07:50.250]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:07:50.250 --> 03:07:52.972]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:07:52.972 --> 03:07:56.234]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:56.234 --> 03:07:58.476]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:07:58.476 --> 03:08:00.437]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:08:14.076 --> 03:08:21.700]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:21.700 --> 03:08:33.427]  Thank you so much, InfoWars, for having me back.
[03:08:33.427 --> 03:08:41.651]  I had a couple of weeks to go doing this, and love Alex, love the opportunity to come on here and talk about things that matter.
[03:08:43.832 --> 03:08:48.393]  Issues of the day, the week, the month.
[03:08:48.393 --> 03:08:51.574]  Of course, we gotta talk about the debate.
[03:08:51.574 --> 03:09:00.737]  Last Monday, Hillary and Donald had the first of the 2016 presidential debates, and I'm gonna be honest.
[03:09:01.789 --> 03:09:03.530]  Very disappointed with Donald Trump.
[03:09:03.530 --> 03:09:05.111]  Very disappointed.
[03:09:05.111 --> 03:09:09.413]  I don't see it as him winning.
[03:09:09.413 --> 03:09:17.557]  His camp, a lot of the polls that I saw going around the internet saw Donald Trump as the winner of that debate.
[03:09:17.557 --> 03:09:23.040]  Some of the more biased mainstream media saw Hillary winning that one.
[03:09:23.040 --> 03:09:28.663]  Each candidate, of course, pros about how they won, respectively.
[03:09:28.663 --> 03:09:30.444]  And I saw it as
[03:09:31.547 --> 03:09:39.657]  Fifteen, twenty good minutes of Donald Trump at the beginning of the debate and then he fell apart.
[03:09:39.657 --> 03:09:47.846]  He was paying much too much attention and spending much too much time defending himself against whatever
[03:09:49.191 --> 03:09:57.217]  Non-existent, inconsequential allegations that were coming up during the debate.
[03:09:57.217 --> 03:10:04.081]  Lester Holt, a shill, a shill for Hillary and the Democratic Party.
[03:10:04.081 --> 03:10:05.622]  He had to overcome that.
[03:10:05.622 --> 03:10:10.726]  I do give Trump the benefit of the doubt in that he had to deal with that.
[03:10:10.726 --> 03:10:13.247]  He had to deal with potential cheating.
[03:10:13.247 --> 03:10:18.711]  Now, I don't know, I don't know for sure that any of this was going on, but just the fact that
[03:10:19.352 --> 03:10:29.386]  There's a chance, and it seems feasible because Hillary has been such a liar over the years, that she cheated during the debate.
[03:10:30.416 --> 03:10:32.757]  Another thing that Trump had to overcome.
[03:10:32.757 --> 03:10:35.757]  So he had to go in there with his A-game.
[03:10:35.757 --> 03:10:40.559]  Expectations were low for him because he is a businessman, he's not a politician.
[03:10:40.559 --> 03:10:46.680]  Although he has been in a lot of conferences and boardrooms and whatnot, he's not a debater.
[03:10:46.680 --> 03:10:50.841]  He's not a political debate expert.
[03:10:50.841 --> 03:10:53.782]  So we also gave him the benefit of the doubt on that.
[03:10:55.059 --> 03:11:02.587]  But he got up there and did exactly what they, the Democrats and Hillary, wanted him to do.
[03:11:02.587 --> 03:11:07.732]  They baited him, and he took the bait.
[03:11:07.732 --> 03:11:18.183]  Talking about the birth certificate issue, the birther issue, that Obama perhaps was not born in the country.
[03:11:19.412 --> 03:11:25.917]  Is that really something that I want these candidates talking about during a debate?
[03:11:25.917 --> 03:11:27.178]  Do I care?
[03:11:27.178 --> 03:11:34.383]  Do I care that he called a former Miss Universe contestant, was it?
[03:11:34.383 --> 03:11:37.024]  Or Miss America contestant?
[03:11:37.024 --> 03:11:38.986]  The guy ran beauty pageants.
[03:11:38.986 --> 03:11:39.646]  That's what he did.
[03:11:39.646 --> 03:11:43.349]  He's a businessman, he's an entertainer, reality show guy.
[03:11:43.349 --> 03:11:47.312]  So at one point in his career, he's running beauty contests 20 years ago.
[03:11:48.132 --> 03:11:55.756]  And one of the contest winners gained weight, and Donald Trump called her Miss Piggy.
[03:11:55.756 --> 03:12:05.402]  Okay, you know, perhaps not the most politically correct thing to do, but who said politically correct is a good thing?
[03:12:05.402 --> 03:12:08.823]  Again, he's in entertainment at the time.
[03:12:08.823 --> 03:12:10.184]  He's not running for office.
[03:12:10.184 --> 03:12:13.626]  He's not in office.
[03:12:13.626 --> 03:12:16.688]  And they're arguing about this during the presidential debate.
[03:12:17.540 --> 03:12:34.567]  When they should be talking about national security, the economy, education, and all of those things that Hillary has dropped the ball on in her 40 years in the public eye.
[03:12:34.567 --> 03:12:40.450]  That didn't get brought up, and I squarely place the blame on Donald Trump.
[03:12:40.450 --> 03:12:42.471]  And again, Lester Holt, a shill.
[03:12:43.770 --> 03:12:52.332]  But a smart guy and a guy that has all that ammunition against Hillary Clinton should have used it.
[03:12:52.332 --> 03:13:03.474]  And for him to sit there and try to justify him calling a beauty pageant winner from 20 years ago, Miss Piggy, was horrible!
[03:13:03.474 --> 03:13:04.595]  Horrible to watch!
[03:13:04.595 --> 03:13:06.435]  Frustrating as hell!
[03:13:06.435 --> 03:13:10.236]  As a guy that wants real change in this country,
[03:13:11.465 --> 03:13:27.620]  And wants to see what will happen if a guy gets in there that is a strong, smart businessman and not a professional, lifetime politician, not beholden to other nations and companies and Wall Street like Hillary Clinton is.
[03:13:27.620 --> 03:13:28.981]  I want to see this!
[03:13:28.981 --> 03:13:36.347]  So it was very frustrating watching that debate to see her getting over on him.
[03:13:37.248 --> 03:13:47.515]  By bringing up inconsequential topics and subjects and having him just sitting there or standing there defending himself.
[03:13:48.621 --> 03:13:50.943]  It looked bad.
[03:13:50.943 --> 03:13:55.386]  Hillary wasn't even supposed to be able to stand for 90 minutes.
[03:13:55.386 --> 03:13:58.948]  She was supposed to come out looking very haggard and terrible.
[03:13:58.948 --> 03:14:00.069]  She didn't.
[03:14:00.069 --> 03:14:03.071]  She came out looking spry, healthy.
[03:14:03.071 --> 03:14:04.452]  She didn't cough.
[03:14:04.452 --> 03:14:08.955]  She stood there for 90 minutes.
[03:14:08.955 --> 03:14:13.539]  That alone put her up a notch, unfortunately.
[03:14:13.539 --> 03:14:17.762]  And look, believe me, I cannot stand the woman.
[03:14:19.082 --> 03:14:20.663]  I want to see Trump win.
[03:14:20.663 --> 03:14:22.204]  I want to see him do well.
[03:14:22.204 --> 03:14:27.387]  But I can't sit here and fake it that he won that debate.
[03:14:27.387 --> 03:14:28.507]  He didn't.
[03:14:28.507 --> 03:14:30.248]  He did not win that debate.
[03:14:30.248 --> 03:14:33.130]  He's got to do a much better job next time.
[03:14:33.130 --> 03:14:36.171]  I don't know what his strategy was.
[03:14:36.171 --> 03:14:44.396]  If it was, hey, we got a few of these things, why would I shoot my whole load of ammunition
[03:14:45.676 --> 03:14:50.218]  At the beginning, the first debate, this isn't the one people remember.
[03:14:50.218 --> 03:14:53.380]  The last one, that's where you go in.
[03:14:53.380 --> 03:15:02.164]  That's the one people are going to remember the most when they go into the voting booths and pull the levers or press the buttons or whatever the hell we're supposed to do this election.
[03:15:05.034 --> 03:15:09.697]  That's why he needs to come out stronger in these next debates.
[03:15:09.697 --> 03:15:12.298]  He's gotta hit her harder.
[03:15:12.298 --> 03:15:19.102]  Now, of course, they would say, oh, hit her harder, you sexist, misogynistic monster!
[03:15:19.102 --> 03:15:23.005]  This is a woman, he can't look like he's bullying a woman!
[03:15:23.005 --> 03:15:30.729]  He can't look like he's beating up on a... This will be fact-based, and it will be, um,
[03:15:32.739 --> 03:15:34.361]  Exactly what he needs to do.
[03:15:34.361 --> 03:15:36.202]  There's so many things.
[03:15:36.202 --> 03:15:38.224]  Benghazi, bring it up.
[03:15:38.224 --> 03:15:39.906]  The email scandal, bring it up.
[03:15:39.906 --> 03:15:43.129]  They talked about cyber security!
[03:15:43.129 --> 03:15:46.152]  Cyber security came up!
[03:15:46.152 --> 03:15:48.875]  And Hillary gets to blurt out this.
[03:15:48.875 --> 03:15:51.657]  He was encouraging the Russians
[03:15:52.538 --> 03:16:02.847]  To hack into our computer system, not understanding that Trump was absolutely being sarcastic, telling a joke.
[03:16:02.847 --> 03:16:14.498]  Actually, the emphasis of that statement was the fact that Hillary's server and emails were so insecure out there, and out there for anyone to get, that, hey, Russia, if you happen to see him, send him over.
[03:16:14.498 --> 03:16:16.460]  The press wants to get a hold of her emails.
[03:16:17.380 --> 03:16:19.881]  Not, hey Russia, spy on us.
[03:16:19.881 --> 03:16:26.823]  But of course, they twist around everything because they are lifetime professional politicians.
[03:16:26.823 --> 03:16:30.885]  And Hillary's talking about that, getting Trump on that issue.
[03:16:30.885 --> 03:16:34.986]  He doesn't turn around and say, how dare you?
[03:16:34.986 --> 03:16:41.889]  The gall of you to try to tell the American people that you're the cyber security person?
[03:16:41.889 --> 03:16:45.350]  The go-to person in the age of cyber security?
[03:16:46.701 --> 03:16:48.662]  That's a no-brainer.
[03:16:48.662 --> 03:16:53.284]  That's an easy softball lobbed right at him.
[03:16:53.284 --> 03:16:57.266]  Don't just go, wrong, no.
[03:16:57.266 --> 03:17:01.568]  You're on the debate stage.
[03:17:01.568 --> 03:17:04.450]  A record number of people are watching you.
[03:17:05.624 --> 03:17:07.244]  Slammer!
[03:17:07.244 --> 03:17:17.467]  She's got a horrific, horrific record that you could use against her, and I didn't see that, and damn it, it was frustrating.
[03:17:17.467 --> 03:17:20.027]  Frustrating to watch.
[03:17:20.027 --> 03:17:23.048]  And, toward the end, he fell apart even more.
[03:17:23.048 --> 03:17:26.169]  He's explaining his finances
[03:17:27.199 --> 03:17:33.363]  He's explaining the birth certificate issue?
[03:17:33.363 --> 03:17:43.408]  I mean, honestly, turn it around, tell the American people, look into that camera at the debate and tell them, this is nonsense.
[03:17:43.408 --> 03:17:52.534]  I was talking on my own program about how, where would that rate for America in importance?
[03:17:53.356 --> 03:18:05.245]  To national security, borders, education, crime, violence, race relations, foreign policy, the economy, jobs.
[03:18:05.245 --> 03:18:12.470]  Where does he said Miss Piggy to a beauty pageant girl 20 years ago?
[03:18:12.470 --> 03:18:17.834]  Where does that rate on your list as an American as important?
[03:18:18.991 --> 03:18:22.092]  Pretty far down the line, I'd say.
[03:18:22.092 --> 03:18:33.137]  I'm gonna take a stab at it and say that the majority of American people, even the ones that are in a basket of deplorables, would say that that wouldn't even show up.
[03:18:33.137 --> 03:18:44.963]  Yet it was on the world stage during a presidential debate, and Trump didn't turn around and instead of explaining it,
[03:18:46.104 --> 03:18:47.825]  He didn't just turn around and go, really?
[03:18:47.825 --> 03:18:49.847]  Is that what we're going to discuss here?
[03:18:49.847 --> 03:18:50.967]  Lester?
[03:18:50.967 --> 03:18:52.188]  Hillary?
[03:18:52.188 --> 03:19:01.394]  That's what we're... That's what the American people, 85 million of them that have tuned into this, that's what they want to hear us talk about?
[03:19:01.394 --> 03:19:08.839]  Or do they want to hear about how she left four people to die in Benghazi?
[03:19:08.839 --> 03:19:15.724]  Or her emails are all over the globe because she decided an unsecured server was a good idea.
[03:19:17.645 --> 03:19:17.985]  Really?
[03:19:17.985 --> 03:19:28.448]  Her Clinton Global Initiative, the foundation, is so corrupt and was selling off the American government.
[03:19:28.448 --> 03:19:36.850]  Do you think that's a little more important, people, than if I said that Obama didn't have a birth certificate?
[03:19:36.850 --> 03:19:39.111]  Or that I called a beauty queen Miss Piggy?
[03:19:40.902 --> 03:19:44.643]  I think you know the answer to that one, people.
[03:19:44.643 --> 03:19:48.064]  I think you know the answer to that.
[03:19:48.064 --> 03:19:49.785]  Again, thanks for having me.
[03:19:49.785 --> 03:19:52.185]  I'll be back in just a couple of minutes.
[03:19:52.185 --> 03:19:54.106]  This is InfoWars.
[03:19:54.106 --> 03:19:59.808]  I'm Anthony Cumia for Alex Jones, the wonderful Alex Jones.
[03:19:59.808 --> 03:20:00.448]  I'll be right back.
[03:20:02.503 --> 03:20:06.688]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[03:20:06.688 --> 03:20:12.875]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[03:20:12.875 --> 03:20:14.637]  How is this even possible?
[03:20:14.637 --> 03:20:21.945]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[03:20:22.185 --> 03:20:30.151]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[03:20:30.151 --> 03:20:34.514]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[03:20:34.514 --> 03:20:43.280]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[03:20:43.280 --> 03:20:44.861]  But you must act fast.
[03:20:44.861 --> 03:20:49.404]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard, our supply is extremely limited right now.
[03:20:49.684 --> 03:20:55.628]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[03:20:55.628 --> 03:20:59.050]  That's Greens75.com.
[03:20:59.050 --> 03:21:00.291]  Greens75.com.
[03:21:00.291 --> 03:21:03.893]  Dude, what happened to your face?
[03:21:03.893 --> 03:21:04.693]  My razor.
[03:21:04.693 --> 03:21:06.394]  Trying to save money on blades.
[03:21:06.394 --> 03:21:07.555]  You should try Harry's.
[03:21:07.555 --> 03:21:08.335]  Harry's?
[03:21:08.335 --> 03:21:10.417]  I think I read an article in the journal about them.
[03:21:10.417 --> 03:21:14.339]  The two guys who started that company with its own factory in Germany?
[03:21:14.339 --> 03:21:14.940]  Right.
[03:21:14.940 --> 03:21:16.140]  And they sell online.
[03:21:16.140 --> 03:21:18.282]  Look, open a new tab and go to Harry's.com.

[03:21:40.354 --> 03:21:43.996]  And because Harry's owns the factory, you never overpay.

[03:23:29.731 --> 03:23:31.752]  Impossible in an emergency.

[03:23:37.895 --> 03:23:46.279]  It sells to the general public for $27 plus shipping, and it's been rated 4.5 out of 5 stars by customers who paid full price.

[03:24:48.357 --> 03:24:57.701]  The experts agree that gut health plays a huge role in the normal function of your immune system and it's essential for optimum health.
[03:24:57.701 --> 03:25:05.265]  Your gut, that gut of yours, is even home to over 100 million neurons, brain neurotransmitters,
[03:25:06.005 --> 03:25:14.132]  And is often called your second brain, right there in your gut, because of the direct link between the brain and the digestive system.

[03:25:52.997 --> 03:25:55.239]  We are back.
[03:25:55.239 --> 03:25:57.180]  InfoWars.com.
[03:25:57.180 --> 03:25:58.080]  I'm Anthony Cumia.
[03:25:58.080 --> 03:26:01.663]  I can't even say my last name when I do this.
[03:26:01.663 --> 03:26:04.445]  My show, I say my name all the time.
[03:26:04.445 --> 03:26:06.106]  I never screw it up.
[03:26:06.106 --> 03:26:08.868]  Doing InfoWars, I screw up my own name.
[03:26:08.868 --> 03:26:09.929]  I don't know how it's done.
[03:26:11.270 --> 03:26:14.153]  Wonderful, wonderful to be back.
[03:26:14.153 --> 03:26:26.647]  Was just talking about Hillary, Donald, the debate of last week, or the beginning of the week, and some of his shortcomings.
[03:26:26.647 --> 03:26:29.229]  I was a little disappointed.
[03:26:29.850 --> 03:26:35.474]  With the Donald, as he was called in New York many years ago, the Donald.
[03:26:35.474 --> 03:26:40.618]  I was disappointed though, and think that he really, really needs to step it up next time.
[03:26:40.618 --> 03:26:43.560]  I don't like the yes men.
[03:26:43.560 --> 03:26:51.767]  I watch the news, I see a lot of people pop up saying, that was great, oh my god, he doesn't need yes men.
[03:26:51.767 --> 03:26:54.369]  He has plenty of those, he needs somebody to say Donald.
[03:26:55.589 --> 03:26:58.792]  Here's what you really need to do next time.
[03:26:58.792 --> 03:27:01.353]  I think Giuliani's a good guy for that.
[03:27:01.353 --> 03:27:05.576]  Giuliani, a little nutty.
[03:27:05.576 --> 03:27:09.699]  The last time I've seen him on the news, the last few times, a little nutty, but I like it.
[03:27:09.699 --> 03:27:14.642]  Full of energy and has the right message out there.
[03:27:14.642 --> 03:27:22.307]  I don't like seeing a lot of this Donald standing there saying, I agree with the Secretary on this or that.
[03:27:22.307 --> 03:27:24.829]  There's plenty of other stuff to talk about.
[03:27:25.590 --> 03:27:28.997]  Than agreeing with the good Secretary Clinton.
[03:27:30.839 --> 03:27:32.360]  At these debates.
[03:27:32.360 --> 03:27:39.606]  He needs to slam her on her horrid record of everything that she's done.
[03:27:39.606 --> 03:27:48.113]  I can't think, except for maybe John Kerry as Secretary of State, of a worse Secretary of State than Hillary Clinton.
[03:27:48.113 --> 03:27:52.256]  There isn't any of a huge accomplishment.
[03:27:52.256 --> 03:27:58.421]  Most Secretary of States, they have these accomplishments that are their legacy.
[03:27:58.421 --> 03:27:58.801]  Hers?
[03:27:59.747 --> 03:28:03.068]  Some dead Americans in Benghazi.
[03:28:03.068 --> 03:28:12.772]  A Middle East that is more unstable now than ever, perhaps?
[03:28:12.772 --> 03:28:14.012]  Could it be ever?
[03:28:14.012 --> 03:28:27.297]  And she and Obama directly, directly involved with making that as unstable as it is in the Middle East right now.
[03:28:30.260 --> 03:28:36.367]  Trump also needs to get on her about the fact that she's had the chance.
[03:28:36.367 --> 03:28:38.769]  He brought up, you know, hey, you had 30 years.
[03:28:38.769 --> 03:28:40.571]  He said that in the debate.
[03:28:40.571 --> 03:28:48.800]  Hey, you know, Madam Secretary, you had 30 years to do something and you did nothing.
[03:28:48.800 --> 03:28:49.922]  Expand on that!
[03:28:51.751 --> 03:29:02.019]  Bring up those 30 years and what she didn't do, and the nightmare that she did do to this country.
[03:29:02.019 --> 03:29:04.101]  Bring up the husband!
[03:29:04.101 --> 03:29:07.463]  Bring up the infidelity!
[03:29:07.463 --> 03:29:12.527]  It shows her lack of judgment.
[03:29:12.527 --> 03:29:14.568]  It shows her hypocrisy.
[03:29:14.568 --> 03:29:16.070]  The president for women?
[03:29:17.316 --> 03:29:26.201]  Girls need to know that there's a place because Hillary will lead you and show you.
[03:29:26.201 --> 03:29:41.249]  Excuse me, she defended a child rapist as a lawyer in the 70s and then laughed about the fact that she got him off the hook and knew that he was indeed guilty.
[03:29:42.907 --> 03:29:44.609]  Of raping a 12-year-old girl.
[03:29:44.609 --> 03:29:50.116]  That's the kind of president for the women that we want?
[03:29:50.116 --> 03:29:50.937]  I don't think so.
[03:29:50.937 --> 03:29:52.319]  Trump needs to bring this up.
[03:29:52.319 --> 03:29:53.340]  We'll be right back.
[03:30:02.446 --> 03:30:06.227]  A CNN headline quotes a wealthy Venezuelan saying, I flew to the U.S.
[03:30:06.227 --> 03:30:08.108]  to buy toilet paper.
[03:30:08.108 --> 03:30:20.152]  Venezuela, where the poor are hunting dogs and cats for food, where the criminals are hunting down and killing police for their guns, and where the communist dictator gave Wall Street 700% return on their investment.
[03:30:20.152 --> 03:30:27.894]  The communists and the banksters have destroyed the country so thoroughly that even the wealthy have to get out of the country if they want to wipe their butts.
[03:30:27.894 --> 03:30:30.755]  A true excrement hits the fan scenario.
[03:30:31.175 --> 03:30:38.080]  The 66-year-old Venezuelan flew to New York and went shopping at Whole Foods, biting back tears when she saw a fully stocked food shelf.
[03:30:38.080 --> 03:30:42.663]  She said, you are so happy when you find something as basic as milk.
[03:30:42.663 --> 03:30:48.787]  The socialist welfare state and bankster crony capitalism are not just policies and friends of Hugo Chavez.
[03:30:48.787 --> 03:30:51.889]  They're also the policies and friends of Hillary Clinton.
[03:30:51.889 --> 03:30:54.231]  And there's another lesson to learn from this wealthy Venezuelan.
[03:30:54.451 --> 03:31:00.136]  It doesn't matter how much money you have if there's no food and medicine when these crooks destroy your economy.
[03:31:00.136 --> 03:31:02.357]  From FoodWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:31:02.357 --> 03:31:03.999]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:31:03.999 --> 03:31:05.500]  You can't survive without it.
[03:31:05.500 --> 03:31:06.681]  But where do you get it?
[03:31:06.681 --> 03:31:12.685]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:31:12.685 --> 03:31:18.410]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:31:18.590 --> 03:31:35.471]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[03:31:35.831 --> 03:31:38.332]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:31:38.332 --> 03:31:39.793]  Stainless steel construction.

[03:31:40.833 --> 03:31:41.754]  Low maintenance.
[03:31:41.754 --> 03:31:43.854]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:32:35.021 --> 03:32:38.606]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks attempting to deceive you.
[03:32:38.846 --> 03:32:47.713]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces who are trying to sway public opinion in an unnatural direction that only serves establishment agendas.
[03:32:47.713 --> 03:32:52.758]  But InfoWars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.

[03:33:14.622 --> 03:33:18.846]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:18.846 --> 03:33:23.410]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:46.630 --> 03:33:53.394]  Ladies and gentlemen, back, Anthony Cumia on InfoWars.com.
[03:33:53.394 --> 03:34:12.725]  Just when you think things can't get any more ridiculous, and just when you think Barack Obama couldn't screw things up with such limited time left in his tenure as President of these United States, 48 hours from now,
[03:34:15.771 --> 03:34:29.037]  Obama is turning over control of the Internet to foreign entities, which really means the United Nations, which they promised it would not go to.
[03:34:29.037 --> 03:34:34.840]  But, first of all, the biggest question is, why?
[03:34:34.840 --> 03:34:41.303]  Why would we, as a country, give over control of the Internet to anybody?
[03:34:42.253 --> 03:34:59.921]  This is technology made here in the United States for our own convenience, information, future, built with our minds and materials here in this country.
[03:34:59.921 --> 03:35:07.045]  Once again, just amazing things that came out of the United States.
[03:35:07.045 --> 03:35:11.087]  And for years, as an exceptional nation,
[03:35:12.150 --> 03:35:28.062]  We were very proud of these things that we built and showed the world how exceptional this country is and why we are proud to be Americans.
[03:35:28.062 --> 03:35:31.705]  And Obama decides, meh!
[03:35:31.705 --> 03:35:35.828]  Why does the United States have to be so exceptional?
[03:35:35.828 --> 03:35:39.471]  Let's give away the store and the internet
[03:35:40.489 --> 03:35:53.259]  We'll be going to foreign entity, some group, a consortium of countries that will take control of the Internet.
[03:35:53.259 --> 03:35:55.321]  How is this a good thing?
[03:35:55.321 --> 03:36:07.010]  The reason the United States should and has had control of the Internet, not even the fact that it was made here, our basic
[03:36:08.482 --> 03:36:21.627]  Principles, freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of the press, all are very conducive to making the Internet what it is.
[03:36:21.627 --> 03:36:31.731]  An open, free environment to voice your opinions, good or bad, popular or unpopular.
[03:36:31.731 --> 03:36:33.712]  It's supposed to work that way, and believe me,
[03:36:34.727 --> 03:36:43.437]  In the United States, you can't find a better country, a better nation of free people to run it.
[03:36:43.437 --> 03:36:50.845]  I know sometimes it just looks like a disaster, but therein lies the rub, as they say.
[03:36:54.198 --> 03:36:57.561]  It's supposed to be good and bad.
[03:36:57.561 --> 03:37:06.768]  It's supposed to be an amazing transfer of information and a despicable place where horrid things are said.
[03:37:06.768 --> 03:37:11.092]  That's why America is the place the Internet should be.
[03:37:11.092 --> 03:37:15.835]  It should be under control of.
[03:37:15.835 --> 03:37:18.738]  Who thought it would be a good idea
[03:37:19.952 --> 03:37:25.697]  To turn over control of the Internet to the likes of China.
[03:37:25.697 --> 03:37:36.185]  Yes, China will have a hand in deciding how the Internet goes into this century.
[03:37:36.185 --> 03:37:42.811]  Do you really think they want honesty, truth, freedom of expression?
[03:37:44.124 --> 03:37:45.324]  Freedom of press?
[03:37:45.324 --> 03:37:47.385]  Do you think China wants that?
[03:37:47.385 --> 03:38:07.333]  When already, in their corner of the world's internet, they have false digital security certificates for a number of websites, which is a way for them to keep tabs on what everybody's doing on other websites.
[03:38:07.333 --> 03:38:11.775]  You think you're in China, you're going to open a free website.
[03:38:11.775 --> 03:38:13.436]  They're petrified over there!
[03:38:14.485 --> 03:38:21.887]  People write things, dissidents about the government over there, and they get in big trouble!
[03:38:21.887 --> 03:38:27.688]  Not just, you know, oh I wrote something politically incorrect on Twitter, ooh I'm in trouble trouble.
[03:38:27.688 --> 03:38:29.369]  Jail!
[03:38:29.369 --> 03:38:31.249]  Or worse, execution.
[03:38:31.249 --> 03:38:38.691]  They don't want to hear freedom and openness and criticism in China.
[03:38:38.691 --> 03:38:41.412]  If that's not bad enough, how about Russia?
[03:38:41.412 --> 03:38:42.312]  How about Russia?
[03:38:43.246 --> 03:38:55.932]  Wants or is going to have a say in the main framework and the future of the World Wide Web, what is the Internet.
[03:38:55.932 --> 03:38:58.313]  Do you trust Vladimir Putin?
[03:38:58.313 --> 03:39:01.815]  There you go, Chinese dissident lawyer.
[03:39:03.517 --> 03:39:05.279]  I'm not even going to try with the name.
[03:39:05.279 --> 03:39:06.480]  I won't even try.
[03:39:06.480 --> 03:39:08.422]  Destroyed by jail.
[03:39:08.422 --> 03:39:10.505]  That's how it works.
[03:39:10.505 --> 03:39:12.507]  They don't want freedom.
[03:39:12.507 --> 03:39:17.733]  Russia, another country that's going to have a say.
[03:39:17.733 --> 03:39:23.399]  They've chipped away at internet freedom in Russia since Putin returned to the Kremlin in 2012.
[03:39:25.057 --> 03:39:37.186]  As International Business Times puts it in their 2014 article, one of Putin's new laws requires bloggers with over 3,000 readers to register with the government.
[03:39:37.186 --> 03:39:44.772]  Does that sound like a place where something like InfoWars can broadcast and be open?
[03:39:44.772 --> 03:39:46.313]  Look at this guy!
[03:39:46.313 --> 03:39:51.497]  I don't think I want this guy having a say in what happens on the internet.
[03:39:53.120 --> 03:39:55.922]  You think he's gonna like your tweets?
[03:39:55.922 --> 03:39:58.264]  And your Facebook posts?
[03:39:58.264 --> 03:40:02.407]  You think he's gonna like some of your opinions?
[03:40:02.407 --> 03:40:04.489]  I don't think so.
[03:40:04.489 --> 03:40:08.653]  But Obama thought this was a good idea.
[03:40:08.653 --> 03:40:22.584]  And if you don't think it's going to affect our freedoms and what we do here in the United States on the internet, the freedoms we so enjoy, you're delusional.
[03:40:23.820 --> 03:40:30.521]  This is another way that Barack Obama has knocked down the old U.S.
[03:40:30.521 --> 03:40:31.542]  a notch.
[03:40:31.542 --> 03:40:32.462]  There it is.
[03:40:32.462 --> 03:40:34.162]  Give away that internet, right?
[03:40:34.162 --> 03:40:35.482]  Give it away.
[03:40:35.482 --> 03:40:40.223]  This is how he's knocked the United States down a notch.
[03:40:40.223 --> 03:40:45.164]  He does not like the United States to be exceptional.
[03:40:45.164 --> 03:40:52.566]  To be a place that other countries envy, look at with respect, fear,
[03:40:54.168 --> 03:40:56.709]  And leadership.
[03:40:56.709 --> 03:41:00.551]  They look at the United States as a world leader.
[03:41:00.551 --> 03:41:04.353]  Obama never liked that.
[03:41:04.353 --> 03:41:20.902]  If you've read anything about his dad, dear old dad, his father had a massive problem with imperialism and perceived colonialism of Western nations.
[03:41:22.017 --> 03:41:27.579]  The UK, United States, and that carried over.
[03:41:27.579 --> 03:41:33.460]  That absolutely carried over into Obama's mindset.
[03:41:33.460 --> 03:41:39.982]  And he sees it as his job to bring down the US.
[03:41:39.982 --> 03:41:41.683]  Knock it down a little bit.
[03:41:41.683 --> 03:41:46.945]  It got a little too big for its britches, and Obama's gonna bring it down a bit.
[03:41:46.945 --> 03:41:51.506]  And controlling the people's ability
[03:41:52.577 --> 03:42:01.144]  To voice their opinions, voice their dissent, is an amazing way of doing this.
[03:42:01.144 --> 03:42:16.076]  Because we as a people, I still believe, even though a lot of us are in a huge basket of deplorables, we as American people are amazingly brilliant, resilient, innovative,
[03:42:17.213 --> 03:42:17.653]  I don't know.
[03:42:34.147 --> 03:42:50.373]  You're left with a government that has a lot more power, and you're left with a people that has a lot less say in their own country and on the world stage, and that's exactly what Obama's been doing to the United States of America for all these years.
[03:42:53.045 --> 03:42:57.406]  I was so proud of the space program growing up.
[03:42:57.406 --> 03:43:14.811]  My God, to me, it was magic as a child to watch a Saturn V rocket, a skyscraper that they amazingly launched into the sky and took men to the moon.
[03:43:16.417 --> 03:43:25.664]  And now, we sit and hitch a ride with the ex-Soviet Union, Russia.
[03:43:25.664 --> 03:43:32.289]  We have to hitchhike, because we don't even have a vehicle to take Americans into space anymore.
[03:43:32.289 --> 03:43:35.051]  Again, knocked down a few notches.
[03:43:35.051 --> 03:43:42.797]  Our exceptionalism that led to America, Americans and the American flag being on the moon,
[03:43:44.708 --> 03:43:48.752]  That had to be done away with for some reason.
[03:43:48.752 --> 03:44:08.812]  And if you don't think Hillary Clinton is in that same category, a globalist, someone that wants to rule the world, be on the global stage, make America just another part of the bigger global picture,
[03:44:10.060 --> 03:44:13.504]  Boy, are you sadly mistaken if you don't think that's what Hillary wants.
[03:44:13.504 --> 03:44:14.865]  She's proven it.
[03:44:14.865 --> 03:44:17.068]  That's what she's done over the years.
[03:44:17.068 --> 03:44:18.690]  And I don't know.
[03:44:18.690 --> 03:44:20.212]  I don't like it.
[03:44:20.212 --> 03:44:25.417]  I do like a tad bit of nationalism in our country.
[03:44:25.417 --> 03:44:27.980]  National pride.
[03:44:27.980 --> 03:44:28.921]  Being exceptional.
[03:44:30.077 --> 03:44:35.361]  Hillary Clinton out-raising Trump 20 to 1 among billionaires.
[03:44:35.361 --> 03:44:37.303]  This is globalism!
[03:44:37.303 --> 03:44:44.868]  This is a woman that wants to be president of the United States in a global arena.
[03:44:44.868 --> 03:44:48.151]  She has no pride in this nation.
[03:44:48.151 --> 03:44:50.252]  She doesn't want our country to do well.
[03:44:50.993 --> 03:45:02.402]  She wants her and her elitists, global elitists, like Soros, all of them to do well and get as much power over the world as they can.
[03:45:02.402 --> 03:45:17.433]  Donald Trump, on the other hand, really seems to be a guy that wants to make America great again, as they say, by bringing it back on the world stage as a power, as a respected and feared power.
[03:45:18.860 --> 03:45:28.185]  Using all of our resources to make the country great and make it respected.
[03:45:28.185 --> 03:45:34.268]  Again, when Hillary knocks him on that and says, The country is great!
[03:45:34.268 --> 03:45:43.493]  Donald Trump says, America isn't great anymore!
[03:45:43.493 --> 03:45:44.534]  She's missing the point.
[03:45:45.339 --> 03:45:54.942]  Or, purposefully blowing off the point, which is, it isn't great in that it's not respected.
[03:45:54.942 --> 03:45:58.743]  It doesn't have leadership in the world anymore.
[03:45:58.743 --> 03:46:02.264]  And that needs to be brought back.
[03:46:02.264 --> 03:46:05.145]  It can be done, I think, under different circumstances.
[03:46:05.145 --> 03:46:07.926]  We saw it with Carter and Reagan.
[03:46:07.926 --> 03:46:12.948]  When Jimmy Carter was president, the United States lost a lot of clout
[03:46:15.061 --> 03:46:18.463]  And was a joke to the world.
[03:46:18.463 --> 03:46:21.484]  Militarily, it was a disaster.
[03:46:21.484 --> 03:46:34.869]  Economically, and as far as having any say on the world stage, if I may say world stage again, I think I said it 18 times already, it was a joke.
[03:46:34.869 --> 03:46:40.792]  And Reagan came in and once again restored some pride to the country, and I would hope
[03:46:42.358 --> 03:46:43.759]  Someone can do that.
[03:46:43.759 --> 03:46:47.483]  And Trump is the guy on the other end.
[03:46:47.483 --> 03:46:51.706]  And I hope, like I said about the debates though, he's got to step it up.
[03:46:51.706 --> 03:46:53.308]  This is the big time.
[03:46:53.308 --> 03:46:59.613]  This is not a time to sit back and hope she screws up or falls down again or something like that.
[03:46:59.613 --> 03:47:05.479]  He's got to get up there and really rip down her, the Democrats, the globalists,
[03:47:06.059 --> 03:47:16.546]  All the people that are trying to take away, and have successfully taken away, that American exceptionalism that we've enjoyed for so long.
[03:47:16.546 --> 03:47:32.316]  Like I said, as a kid, watching that Saturn V lift off from the pad, knowing that Americans built this, and were going to the moon and bringing the men back, was just an amazing thing.
[03:47:33.474 --> 03:47:41.079]  And we just don't have that stuff to grab onto anymore, to feel good about as Americans.
[03:47:41.079 --> 03:47:45.362]  We just feel negative these days about being American.
[03:47:45.362 --> 03:47:53.667]  We've been told for so many years that we're terrible and we should be guilty and horrified at everything.
[03:47:53.667 --> 03:48:00.612]  Our history, what we do now, how we've treated people is awful.
[03:48:00.612 --> 03:48:01.393]  What do you expect?
[03:48:02.774 --> 03:48:06.116]  You expect us to feel good and proud?
[03:48:06.116 --> 03:48:12.021]  It's another way to make it easier to kick us down a few notches.
[03:48:12.021 --> 03:48:24.691]  If we as a people feel horrible about what we've done as a nation, it's that much easier to change things and try to reprogram the country into thinking that
[03:48:26.075 --> 03:48:39.904]  We aren't good, and we don't deserve the great things that we've built, and the amazing opportunities and lifestyles that we have here in the United States.
[03:48:39.904 --> 03:48:46.027]  Yeah, Seeds of Disorder High School course is now dedicated to teaching American guilt.
[03:48:46.027 --> 03:48:47.648]  That's it?
[03:48:47.648 --> 03:48:49.770]  It's part of this bigger picture!
[03:48:51.331 --> 03:49:01.558]  This isn't coincidence that all these little things that knock us down just happen to be going on at the same time.
[03:49:01.558 --> 03:49:13.365]  It's a way to demoralize us and take the pride and change the history, make our history an evil thing.
[03:49:13.365 --> 03:49:13.766]  Evil!
[03:49:16.306 --> 03:49:18.127]  That way it could be changed.
[03:49:18.127 --> 03:49:18.987]  Oh, a guilt.
[03:49:18.987 --> 03:49:20.587]  And you see it, people.
[03:49:20.587 --> 03:49:28.250]  You see the guilt, the blatant, rampant guilt of us living an amazing life?
[03:49:28.250 --> 03:49:32.831]  The fact that no one is literally starving to death in this country.
[03:49:32.831 --> 03:49:34.652]  I get heat for saying this all the time.
[03:49:34.652 --> 03:49:36.532]  There are hungry children all over the place.
[03:49:36.532 --> 03:49:37.813]  There's poverty in there.
[03:49:37.813 --> 03:49:39.053]  Yes!
[03:49:39.053 --> 03:49:43.174]  But no one is literally starving to death in this country.
[03:49:43.174 --> 03:49:45.135]  I don't think it could be said in any other country.
[03:49:46.465 --> 03:49:52.989]  You don't see people on the side of the streets in a field dying of starvation.
[03:49:52.989 --> 03:49:58.212]  Occasionally there's a maniac that locks their kid to a radiator and doesn't let him eat.
[03:49:58.212 --> 03:50:07.157]  There are children that obviously are not getting the food they need on a daily basis and are suffering from malnutrition.
[03:50:07.157 --> 03:50:10.439]  But we're not seeing this starvation going on.
[03:50:10.439 --> 03:50:13.561]  Do you know how amazing that is in a country of 300 million people?
[03:50:16.178 --> 03:50:21.823]  That's amazing, and that should be something we should be proud of.
[03:50:21.823 --> 03:50:23.205]  But we're guilty about it.
[03:50:23.205 --> 03:50:29.851]  We're guilty that we have so much food and shelter for people.
[03:50:29.851 --> 03:50:31.472]  Why?
[03:50:31.472 --> 03:50:35.976]  Bask in our exceptionalism as Americans.
[03:50:35.976 --> 03:50:37.337]  Feel good about yourself.
[03:50:37.337 --> 03:50:38.378]  Feel proud.
[03:50:38.378 --> 03:50:39.459]  Want to do more.
[03:50:40.259 --> 03:50:58.116]  Want to be better and restore some pride again to how we feel as Americans and not so much like we're this horrible group of people that have done nothing but terrorize the earth with our amazingness.
[03:50:58.116 --> 03:50:58.597]  Be right back.
[03:51:02.523 --> 03:51:05.145]  Xtendivite is more than just a heart tonic.
[03:51:05.145 --> 03:51:11.189]  Most basic diseases are caused by yeast in the gut and metals in the liver and we all have a bit of both.
[03:51:11.189 --> 03:51:18.414]  The garlic in Xtendivite has a yeast killing effect in the gut while also helping the sulfur enzyme in the liver get rid of the metals.
[03:51:18.414 --> 03:51:21.936]  Xtendivite just may improve your overall health.
[03:51:22.256 --> 03:51:26.979]  Products like Xtendivite are the only way we are going to get our society healthy.
[03:51:26.979 --> 03:51:33.764]  And if you're waiting for the government and pharmaceutical care to solve your health problems, you're gonna have a long, disappointing wait.
[03:51:33.764 --> 03:51:34.844]  I think.
[03:51:34.844 --> 03:51:39.428]  Xtendivite is a complete formula for extended life in the new millennium.
[03:51:39.428 --> 03:51:40.308]  80 can be the new 60.
[03:51:40.308 --> 03:51:46.432]  Xtendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a 2-month supply.
[03:51:46.432 --> 03:51:47.533]  To get started, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:47.533 --> 03:51:47.933]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:52.176 --> 03:51:52.517]  We're good.
[03:52:02.236 --> 03:52:13.103]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:52:13.103 --> 03:52:17.266]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[03:52:17.266 --> 03:52:19.407]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:52:19.407 --> 03:52:24.851]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:52:25.011 --> 03:52:34.999]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:52:34.999 --> 03:52:41.484]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:52:41.484 --> 03:52:44.807]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:52:44.807 --> 03:52:46.869]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:52:46.869 --> 03:52:49.991]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:52:49.991 --> 03:52:51.052]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[03:55:15.248 --> 03:55:16.368]  InfoWars.com.
[03:55:16.368 --> 03:55:18.168]  I'm Anthony Cumia.
[03:55:18.168 --> 03:55:25.150]  You can catch me at CompoundMedia.com Monday through Thursday from 6 or 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:55:25.150 --> 03:55:26.470]  I don't even know what I'm on.
[03:55:26.470 --> 03:55:27.630]  It's 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:55:27.630 --> 03:55:30.791]  Eastern on CompoundMedia.com.
[03:55:30.791 --> 03:55:32.932]  I love being here at InfoWars.com.
[03:55:32.932 --> 03:55:38.493]  Thank you so much to Alex Jones and his staff over there who are amazing.
[03:55:38.493 --> 03:55:38.813]  I love it.
[03:55:41.482 --> 03:55:49.291]  The media, ooh boy, they have shown their true colors this election.
[03:55:49.291 --> 03:55:59.202]  Before we knew how biased they were and how terrible and unfair they've been to the candidates.
[03:56:01.411 --> 03:56:05.953]  But until this election, they almost tried to hide it.
[03:56:05.953 --> 03:56:16.939]  You would talk about liberal bias in the media and people would be like, oh stop, you're paranoid, oh please, oh they're biased the other way, here, here, and here.
[03:56:16.939 --> 03:56:26.545]  But man, have they just, they're so desperate to get their candidate elected and to keep Trump out.
[03:56:27.745 --> 03:56:31.148]  That they've just gone full biased.
[03:56:31.148 --> 03:56:33.449]  They're not even trying to hide it anymore.
[03:56:33.449 --> 03:56:41.976]  And you could see just striking examples of this on a daily basis.
[03:56:41.976 --> 03:56:44.358]  One thing I've noticed, and they've never done this.
[03:56:44.358 --> 03:56:44.858]  There it is.
[03:56:44.858 --> 03:56:46.099]  Conservatives.
[03:56:46.099 --> 03:56:46.860]  Yep.
[03:56:46.860 --> 03:56:47.280]  You're right.
[03:56:47.280 --> 03:56:50.142]  The media is very liberal.
[03:56:50.142 --> 03:56:51.003]  Liberal biased.
[03:56:51.003 --> 03:56:51.303]  Guns.
[03:56:55.393 --> 03:57:01.021]  I've been in so many arguments with people about the Second Amendment, guns, gun rights.
[03:57:02.225 --> 03:57:14.933]  I've never seen a less informed group of people than the liberal anti-gun crowd.
[03:57:14.933 --> 03:57:21.878]  They know nothing about the laws, the mechanics of guns, how they're used, when they're used, the laws.
[03:57:21.878 --> 03:57:26.981]  They know nothing, yet they know everything when you argue with them.
[03:57:29.099 --> 03:57:39.044]  So what I was noticing when I argue with people is, oh, you know, guns are never used to thwart crimes.
[03:57:39.044 --> 03:57:46.227]  Most of the time, they're used to accidentally kill a child or shoot a spouse or something like that.
[03:57:46.227 --> 03:57:53.050]  And the truth of the matter is, they're used plenty of times in thwarting crimes.
[03:57:53.050 --> 03:57:55.291]  We've seen it time and time again.
[03:57:55.291 --> 03:57:56.452]  You have to look, though.
[03:57:56.452 --> 03:57:57.612]  I like going to
[03:58:00.155 --> 03:58:06.061]  The NRA, they have a list of situations where people have used guns.
[03:58:07.265 --> 03:58:09.707]  To thwart crimes and protect themselves.
[03:58:09.707 --> 03:58:11.708]  Armed citizen, it's called.
