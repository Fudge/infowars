[00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:22.326]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.426 --> 00:00:23.767]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.847 --> 00:00:25.768]  It is July 1st, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:33.447 --> 00:00:44.435]  The fall of the Clintons is near as endless scandals and years of corruption finally catch up to Crooked Hillary and former President Bill Clinton.
[00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:49.199]  The issue is how does it impact the work that I do and the work that the Department of Justice does.
[00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.100]  And I certainly wouldn't do it again.
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.921]  Moving on.
[00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:58.393]  Meanwhile, the FBI orders a press blackout.
[00:00:58.613 --> 00:01:08.317]  No photos, no videos, and no transcripts of the secretive meeting between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch.
[00:01:08.757 --> 00:01:09.917]  I'm flabbergasted by it.
[00:01:09.977 --> 00:01:10.798]  I think it's amazing.
[00:01:10.858 --> 00:01:12.318]  I've never seen anything like that before.
[00:01:12.358 --> 00:01:14.259]  This is so illegal.
[00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:16.540]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.322]  All that plus much more, up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.432]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com with an extremely important message.
[00:01:55.933 --> 00:02:00.916]  You're probably asking yourself right now, what's the most important phrase in America right now?
[00:02:01.456 --> 00:02:03.658]  Well, it happens to be Hillary for prison.
[00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:07.420]  Get your Hillary for prison t-shirt today at the InfoWars store for $9.95.
[00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:10.482]  That's half of what it used to be at $19.95.
[00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:12.904]  Why do you want to get this?
[00:02:12.964 --> 00:02:15.485]  Why should you buy this for you and your friends and family?
[00:02:15.826 --> 00:02:18.968]  Because number one, it's a great conversation starter, and number two,
[00:02:19.648 --> 00:02:24.212]  Hell, you get to trigger a whole lot of crazy liberal commie bastards, and that's what I like to do.
[00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:31.778]  And maybe you're just at work right now, and it's casual shirt Friday, and one of your hipster buddies walks in with a Hillary Clinton shirt saying, I'm with her.
[00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:32.599]  Negative!
[00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:33.360]  This is what you're gonna do.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.362]  You're gonna stand up and go, ah, Hillary for prison!
[00:02:36.582 --> 00:02:37.303]  Benghazi!
[00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:43.048]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:50.447]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get your Hillary for Prison shirt today for $9.95 and trigger more assholes like him.
[00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.270]  Come on, Hillary.
[00:02:53.471 --> 00:02:54.051]  Just a little.
[00:02:54.352 --> 00:02:55.132]  Just a little sip.
[00:02:55.693 --> 00:02:55.993]  Open up.
[00:02:56.314 --> 00:02:57.215]  Come on, take it!
[00:02:57.695 --> 00:02:58.076]  Take it!
[00:03:01.656 --> 00:03:10.742]  It seems all too often I have to begin this broadcast talking about the most recent terror attack, and today is no exception, this time at a restaurant in Bangladesh.
[00:03:10.762 --> 00:03:15.364]  It says up to nine gunmen entered, opened fire, and hurled makeshift bombs.
[00:03:15.865 --> 00:03:19.827]  Gunmen armed with pistols, swords, and bombs, according to a witness.
[00:03:20.287 --> 00:03:25.851]  A worker who escaped reported gunmen shouted, Alu Akbar, as they opened fire.
[00:03:26.311 --> 00:03:30.313]  Now, I'm not one of those hate all Muslims, kill all Muslims, blame all Muslims people, but
[00:03:31.514 --> 00:03:43.381]  I do recognize the fact that this attack and the attack before that and the attack before that and the attack before that and the attack before that all have the common theme of people said that they were doing it as the religion of peace.
[00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:49.725]  Once again, many nice Muslim people out there, but if I saw a crime wave or a, you know, series of crimes all
[00:03:50.225 --> 00:03:52.687]  Perpetrated by Hindus or Christians for that matter.
[00:03:52.707 --> 00:03:59.832]  I would recognize the fact that they were doing that and I wouldn't redact it from the official FBI transcripts of what actually happened.
[00:04:00.092 --> 00:04:01.594]  So I think it is relevant.
[00:04:01.894 --> 00:04:03.255]  Now is it to say all of them are doing it?
[00:04:03.335 --> 00:04:04.015]  Absolutely not.
[00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:08.499]  But it is relevant as this is a motivating factor and it's something that definitely needs to be looked at.
[00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:10.980]  And it says nine gumming so far.
[00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:14.104]  By the time you read this, it very well could have changed.
[00:04:14.144 --> 00:04:15.866]  More information may become available.
[00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:19.109]  It may have a more accurate body count, things of that nature.
[00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:21.472]  But that's what it is for the time being.
[00:04:21.993 --> 00:04:23.134]  Now let's talk about some other news.
[00:04:23.174 --> 00:04:25.597]  Bring it back here to the United States of America.
[00:04:25.697 --> 00:04:26.958]  And what difference does it make?
[00:04:26.998 --> 00:04:28.179]  Well, it makes a lot of difference.
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.744]  For the fact that the Attorney General of the United States was meeting with Bill Clinton.
[00:04:33.405 --> 00:04:47.919]  And under normal circumstances, maybe this wouldn't be that big of a deal, but it just happens that Bill's wife is under investigation by the Feds, and nobody on the left really seems to think that this is a pertinent amount of information.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.283]  And we have the report right here, the FBI ordered a press blackout.
[00:04:52.884 --> 00:04:57.246]  The former president steps into her plane and then they speak for 30 minutes privately.
[00:04:57.266 --> 00:05:07.790]  An ABC 15 reporter said about the Phoenix meeting, the FBI there in the tarmac instructing everybody around, no photos, no pictures, no cell phones.
[00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.893]  The FBI may have even violated 18 U.S.
[00:05:11.953 --> 00:05:31.089]  Code 242, which deprives rights under color of law, and it points to a conspiracy to subvert investigations targeting the Clintons because it's not the FBI's job to block journalists or even private citizens from filming public officials who are meeting in an official capacity.
[00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.672]  According to Mrs. Lynch, they weren't talking about anything official.
[00:05:35.692 --> 00:05:40.135]  As a matter of fact, let's just go ahead and listen to what she said the meeting was actually about.
[00:05:40.834 --> 00:05:48.778]  Was it appropriate for you to meet with former President Clinton while your agency is in the middle of an investigation of his wife's email service?
[00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.140]  Well, I did see the president at the Phoenix airport the other night.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.721]  As I was landing, he was headed out.
[00:05:54.421 --> 00:06:01.905]  He did come over and say hello and speak to my husband and myself and talk about his grandchildren and his travels and things like that.
[00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:03.146]  So that was the extent of that.
[00:06:03.266 --> 00:06:06.048]  And no discussions were held on any cases or anything of that.
[00:06:06.288 --> 00:06:08.349]  And he didn't raise anything about that either.
[00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:14.574]  So according to Mrs. Lynch, they were just talking about golf and grandkids and puppy dogs and hot air balloons and all that.
[00:06:14.855 --> 00:06:21.781]  But now we see Judicial Watch is demanding that the inspector general probe into the scandalous Lynch-Clinton meeting.
[00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:29.248]  And even Barack Obama's former advisor, David Axelrod, admitted that the meeting created bad optics.
[00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:33.551]  And of course, Trump jumped on this and he said, it was really a sneak.
[00:06:34.272 --> 00:06:37.335]  It was something that they didn't want publicized, as I understand it.
[00:06:37.776 --> 00:06:38.817]  I think it's so terrible.
[00:06:39.117 --> 00:06:40.318]  I think it's so horrible.
[00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:44.703]  I think it's one of the big stories of the week, of this month, of this year.
[00:06:45.243 --> 00:06:52.511]  And when you consider how Mrs. Clinton is definitely under investigation, I think that is a pretty big deal for Mrs. Lynch to be meeting with Bill.
[00:06:52.891 --> 00:06:55.053]  If nothing else, I think it's a conflict of interest.
[00:06:55.133 --> 00:06:56.014]  Is it criminal?
[00:06:56.975 --> 00:07:13.245]  I guess time will tell, but for right now I think it is definitely a conflict of interest and she has come out on record, Mrs. Lynch saying that she would not do this again and obviously if you're going to do it the first time, you might as well just let the reporters in so they can see that you talk about golf and grandkids and all that kind of stuff.
[00:07:13.645 --> 00:07:18.488]  But this wouldn't be the first time the Clintons were up to something that, in my opinion, just wasn't no good.
[00:07:18.988 --> 00:07:25.932]  If you guys recall, it was earlier this year, and I guess going into last year as well, where Bill was out there campaigning at polling places.
[00:07:26.292 --> 00:07:47.576]  Now, for people who don't know this, like, if you think about if you go to a grocery store or something where the polls are open, you notice the guys in the back of the parking lot with their signs for their candidates or their flags or whatever saying, hey, vote for, you know, candidate X. And the reason they're in the back of the parking lot, because they know you can't be in 150 feet of the polling place influencing public opinion.
[00:07:48.016 --> 00:07:52.797]  Not only was Bill Clinton within 150 feet, he was actually in the freaking polling place.
[00:07:53.218 --> 00:07:54.898]  But nobody wants to take that too serious.
[00:07:55.458 --> 00:08:10.845]  And it says, uh, former President Clinton, he appeared at the rallies for support of his wife and the secretary of state, William F. Galvin, told the New York Times that he had to remind the election workers that even a president can't go inside and work a polling place.
[00:08:10.885 --> 00:08:11.725]  That is correct.
[00:08:12.285 --> 00:08:20.709]  Uh, Mr. Bill Clinton, you cannot be in there influencing the crowd, swaying it one way for your wife, you know, taking pictures as some of the reports say that he was doing it.
[00:08:20.729 --> 00:08:23.430]  I'll just, I'm, I'm, I'm out here talking, you know, I can't do the bill.
[00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:24.111]  I don't know.
[00:08:24.131 --> 00:08:24.371]  I don't know.
[00:08:48.712 --> 00:08:52.753]  Husbands, their fathers, you know, their brothers are not coming home.
[00:08:53.213 --> 00:09:01.716]  And we've seen multiple reports of people being assured by Mrs. Clinton by their telling of the story that, you know, she'd work the thing out, she'd get to the bottom of it.
[00:09:02.196 --> 00:09:05.797]  And later she came out and just said they're liars, they're blowing things out of proportion.
[00:09:06.057 --> 00:09:08.618]  And we have one of these people right here, Benghazi Widow.
[00:09:09.178 --> 00:09:11.699]  Clinton has no right to tell me to move on.
[00:09:12.546 --> 00:09:19.069]  I think that nobody in government can tell me how I feel, what I should feel about it.
[00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:24.511]  She has no right, nor does anyone in government have the right to tell me it's time to move on.
[00:09:25.072 --> 00:09:26.012]  They're not in my shoes.
[00:09:26.672 --> 00:09:32.575]  You know, I think that, you know, that's the essence of what they have done, is they've been dismissive.
[00:09:33.223 --> 00:09:51.068]  Now in other news, as we were talking about earlier, then I guess the overall attitudes towards journalists, and we'll get into that a little bit more with the FBI from another angle, but right now I want to talk about a former CIA operative, and she was giving tips to journalists on how to uncover information and also how to view information in the first place.
[00:09:52.032 --> 00:09:58.338]  ...in Iraq or Syria and ask anybody why America dropped bombs.
[00:09:59.359 --> 00:10:01.541]  You get, they were waging war on Islam.
[00:10:02.462 --> 00:10:05.665]  And you walk in America and you ask, why were we attacked on 9-11?
[00:10:05.965 --> 00:10:08.487]  And you get, they hate us because we're free.
[00:10:09.668 --> 00:10:21.773]  Those are stories manufactured by a really small number of people on both sides who amass a great deal of power and wealth by convincing the rest of us to keep killing each other.
[00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:33.494]  It's always interesting to me the flow of information and I remember when I went to college they made us watch this video or two movies as a matter of fact and at the time I didn't really understand why we were watching these.
[00:10:33.534 --> 00:10:38.417]  I kind of felt like the instructors were wasting our time just giving us a day we didn't have to do any work.
[00:10:38.457 --> 00:10:40.218]  But now I understand them so much better.
[00:10:40.238 --> 00:10:43.460]  They were Wag the Dog and also Network.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.540]  You guys have probably seen Network.
[00:10:44.581 --> 00:10:46.582]  It's in our promo pieces for the Alex Jones Show.
[00:10:47.322 --> 00:10:57.805]  But basically, those two films, and there are many other books, you know, Propaganda, other things out there that you can read, that talk about the control of information and how you're being manipulated into something.
[00:10:57.825 --> 00:11:01.546]  For example, in Wag the Dog, they're trying to sell people this phony war.
[00:11:01.606 --> 00:11:08.828]  So they brought in this big-time Hollywood producer to pretty much manufacture a war of sorts to get people to buy into it.
[00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:10.215]  And that's
[00:11:26.722 --> 00:11:27.223]  That's right.
[00:11:55.367 --> 00:12:10.131]  The classified rules obtained by The Intercept, and dating back to 2013, govern the FBI's use of national security letters, which allow the Bureau to obtain information about journalists' calls without going to a judge or informing the news organization being targeted.
[00:12:10.551 --> 00:12:14.212]  They have previously been released only in heavily redacted form.
[00:12:14.672 --> 00:12:23.895]  Media advocates said the documents show that the FBI imposes few constraints on itself when it bypasses the requirements to go to court and obtain subpoenas or search warrants.
[00:12:24.295 --> 00:12:25.256]  That's exactly right.
[00:12:25.336 --> 00:12:29.839]  When you have a target, you're supposed to have a probable cause.
[00:12:29.899 --> 00:12:33.701]  I'm looking at this person on this date and this activity for this reason.
[00:12:34.002 --> 00:12:40.046]  You can't just say, I feel like looking up Bob over here, so I'm going to go tap his phone or whatever it is that they do.
[00:12:40.686 --> 00:12:49.098]  That is illegal, and I know they have this holier-than-thou thing where I don't need permission of a judge to look at your documents because I'm fighting national security.
[00:12:49.358 --> 00:12:57.109]  Well, if you stop looking at all the journalist files and actually go look at the suspected terrorist, you may prevent some terrorist activity, but that makes too much sense.
[00:12:57.489 --> 00:13:01.572]  You guys are gathering all this metadata, not just FBI, but NSA, whoever else.
[00:13:01.873 --> 00:13:09.599]  They have all this mundane metadata on normal people who are looking up, Googling pressure cookers or buying backpacks.
[00:13:09.919 --> 00:13:10.940]  And they got all this stuff.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.465]  Meanwhile, the terrorists are running wild out here, not just in this country, but all around the world because you guys have this congested apparatus.
[00:13:17.705 --> 00:13:21.128]  We can't even get to the information that you really need to keep the people safe.
[00:13:21.548 --> 00:13:23.370]  And this is a case in point of that.
[00:13:23.731 --> 00:13:29.377]  A suspected terrorist from the Istanbul terrorist mastermind was a refugee protected by the EU.
[00:13:30.489 --> 00:13:42.722]  The Chechen national was on a Russian terrorism watch list since 2003, but received asylum in Austria after he claimed he was severely tortured and under persecution by Russian authorities.
[00:13:43.302 --> 00:13:52.632]  He was later arrested in Sweden after Kalashnikov assault rifles, explosives, and ammunition were found in his car, but he only spent over a year in jail.
[00:13:53.192 --> 00:14:04.778]  Russia again tried to extradite him later as he was crossing the border between Turkey and Bulgaria, but human rights groups pointed to his refugee status in Austria to block Moscow from getting their man.
[00:14:05.058 --> 00:14:18.244]  Yeah, if you guys also remember who else was from Chechnya, the Boston Bombers, at least the older brother, going to various terrorist training camps and DHS calls us or the Russian calls DHS and they're saying, hey, you might want to watch out for this.
[00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:21.987]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it and we all know what happened later.
[00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:38.221]  Regardless of what you think about that whole official narrative, the point is that Russia was warning us and Russia, the country we don't have the best of relations with, saw somebody who was such a serious threat in their mind that they picked up the phone and called us to warn us about it, but nobody really did anything.
[00:14:38.541 --> 00:14:43.065]  A similar thing with this guy, because they were more concerned with being politically correct,
[00:14:43.565 --> 00:14:53.913]  They said this guy's a refugee, he needs to be protected from those evil Russians, even though this guy clearly was a danger even before the most recent terror attack.
[00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:57.956]  And this is the reason why I'm a fan of border security.
[00:14:57.976 --> 00:14:58.977]  I'm not going to say a wall.
[00:14:59.878 --> 00:15:04.521]  I think the wall would be largely ineffective, but it may have its uses in some places.
[00:15:04.961 --> 00:15:07.243]  But regardless, when I meet these people, they say, well,
[00:15:08.484 --> 00:15:10.125]  You should just have free open borders.
[00:15:10.165 --> 00:15:11.125]  Anybody can come in and out.
[00:15:11.246 --> 00:15:16.448]  I think once you're in the United States, you should be able to travel unmolested, no checkpoints, nothing like that.
[00:15:16.528 --> 00:15:22.952]  But to have a border at Mexico, have a border at Canada, international waters, yeah, I think those are there for a reason.
[00:15:23.272 --> 00:15:26.974]  And now it's getting to the point where even Uber drivers are getting suckered into this.
[00:15:27.394 --> 00:15:31.857]  And we see smugglers use Uber-registered drivers to move migrants to U.S.
[00:15:31.917 --> 00:15:32.177]  border.
[00:15:32.697 --> 00:15:34.161]  And this is back on June 10th.
[00:15:34.783 --> 00:15:39.756]  5 vehicles carrying 34 Central American migrants were apprehended while traveling together.
[00:15:40.663 --> 00:15:49.290]  And to be perfectly clear, when we went out to the border earlier this week and we met the family out there, it was about 20 or so people traveling together, mostly women and children.
[00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:51.031]  I have no issue with those people.
[00:15:51.091 --> 00:15:52.673]  My beef is not with them.
[00:15:52.713 --> 00:15:53.894]  They came from El Salvador.
[00:15:53.934 --> 00:15:55.455]  They were walking for two months.
[00:15:55.995 --> 00:15:58.117]  They've ran out of provisions, water, food, whatever.
[00:15:58.177 --> 00:16:00.159]  They just had the clothes on their backs when they got here.
[00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:03.221]  I have no issue with people coming to the country.
[00:16:03.521 --> 00:16:09.086]  I do believe that you should do so legally, but if they find a legal reason or legal avenue to do that, fine.
[00:16:09.326 --> 00:16:10.087]  Welcome to America.
[00:16:10.447 --> 00:16:16.469]  My issue is guys like we just talked about right here, you have these free open systems where these guys can just walk in.
[00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:21.430]  The Border Patrol says they get maybe 48% of the people who come across the border.
[00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.131]  How many guys like this could there be in the United States of America right now?
[00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:26.892]  That's why you have a border system.
[00:16:26.912 --> 00:16:28.052]  That's why you have customs.
[00:16:28.312 --> 00:16:31.233]  That's why you have the Border Patrol checkpoints at Mexico.
[00:16:31.733 --> 00:16:40.824]  In the country, I don't want to go to the checkpoint that's 100 miles inland where they ask me if I'm an American citizen and you're looking in the back at Don because he's a brown-skinned gentleman.
[00:16:41.365 --> 00:16:42.246]  That's not my bag.
[00:16:42.306 --> 00:16:46.751]  But at the border, that's what I like, not the stuff that's going on here currently.
[00:16:47.762 --> 00:16:51.464]  And one of the things going on at the border is, of course, we're sending guns out.
[00:16:51.524 --> 00:16:53.665]  But now, what about guns in the country?
[00:16:53.985 --> 00:16:58.887]  Now we see an anti-gun senator was arrested in Ferguson for carrying a 9mm.
[00:16:59.007 --> 00:17:05.010]  Long story short, she was supposedly, allegedly, reportedly intoxicated.
[00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.371]  The cops wanted her to do a breathalyzer.
[00:17:07.391 --> 00:17:08.031]  She refused.
[00:17:08.491 --> 00:17:15.114]  And she was officially charged with failure to obey a lawful order of police and walking in the roadway.
[00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:25.317]  It's a very interesting thing because we always see these anti-gun senators, congressmen, like that guy out there in California who got arrested for running all those guns.
[00:17:25.678 --> 00:17:31.680]  And other guys around the country, they get arrested with guns, but they don't want you to have one because they think you're just as crazy as they are.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.741]  Moving quickly now, talking about guns.
[00:17:34.141 --> 00:17:39.263]  ISIS is gunning down Christians in Egypt, but nobody cares because that's politically correct for them to do so.
[00:17:39.743 --> 00:17:46.746]  If a Christian man shot somebody else of another religion, it would be an international sensation, but they killed the gentleman.
[00:17:46.846 --> 00:17:54.849]  Also, a Hindu priest was killed back on June 7th, and you didn't hear anything about that because it's not politically correct to talk about that.
[00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:58.430]  And briefly, before we go to break, come back with more special reports.
[00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:02.911]  Milo, you guys recall him, Joe Biggs, and he traveled around the country going to various rallies.
[00:18:03.311 --> 00:18:15.614]  Milo is going to hold a gay pride parade in Sweden, Swedish Muslim ghetto, because I don't know if you guys saw the report that Biggs, Leanne, and our new hire, Margaret, did talking about the rape-free bracelets.
[00:18:15.634 --> 00:18:18.634]  And when you go to these countries and you're told off your thing, they won't rape you or attack you.
[00:18:18.895 --> 00:18:19.615]  It's a complete joke.
[00:18:19.635 --> 00:18:22.195]  So he's going to go there to point that out as well as other things.
[00:18:22.255 --> 00:18:24.856]  Stay tuned after this for more special reports.
[00:18:37.935 --> 00:18:45.719]  We celebrate the 4th of July as a reminder of earning our independence from a tyrannical and oppressive government.
[00:18:45.939 --> 00:18:52.482]  Just a reminder to the Obama administration, there's plenty of room on the calendar for another holiday.
[00:19:01.781 --> 00:19:08.866]  These were the chaotic scenes as residents of a city in Southeastern Venezuela went on the rampage in search of basic food items.
[00:19:09.646 --> 00:19:15.570]  People desperate for staples like milk, rice and flour stormed a supermarket warehouse in Guayana City.
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:25.502]  If you go back to 2007, the British Ministry of Defense came out and echoed a Department of Defense report from here in the U.S.
[00:19:25.542 --> 00:19:37.084]  saying that beginning in the year 2016, right through 2020 to 2030, that they believe there would be massive multi-hundred percent food price increases worldwide.
[00:19:37.944 --> 00:19:45.926]  And that during that global meltdown, that there would be incredible social unrest that would depopulate much of the Earth.
[00:19:46.957 --> 00:19:58.285]  Now, in 2016, Vice Magazine and other publications are reporting on a 2015 report produced by the U.S.
[00:19:58.325 --> 00:20:11.134]  government, the U.N., and scores of foreign nations, as well as the State Department, overseen by food giant Cargill, the World Bank, and most importantly, the World Wildlife Fund.
[00:20:11.815 --> 00:20:12.796]  The World Wildlife Fund
[00:20:13.616 --> 00:20:21.863]  is a eugenics anti-human organization set up by Prince Bernhard who also founded the Bilderberg Group and who was a Nazi officer.
[00:20:22.524 --> 00:20:36.556]  This organization sells environmentalism to make the elite look like heroes saving the earth when in truth they are ushering in a planetary tyranny that is irrevocably damaging the fabric of our planet.
[00:20:37.096 --> 00:20:38.658]  In this new FEMA report
[00:20:39.602 --> 00:20:46.185]  With headline, FEMA contractor predicts social unrest caused by 395% food price spikes.
[00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:59.130]  You learn that this is a report filed with governments and major institutions overseen by a contractor that since the 1940s has been the main advisor for the U.S.
[00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.211]  Navy Marine Corps.
[00:21:00.987 --> 00:21:05.932]  The challenges and crises that we were assigned are exactly what we expect to see in the future.
[00:21:05.992 --> 00:21:06.973]  So you've got famine.
[00:21:07.133 --> 00:21:08.535]  You've got increased pests.
[00:21:08.615 --> 00:21:10.156]  Food prices are going up 400%.
[00:21:11.177 --> 00:21:13.039]  We've got a flood of migrants coming in.
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.701]  The world is starting to fall apart.
[00:21:15.021 --> 00:21:17.824]  Everything we do is going to have some negative effect.
[00:21:18.565 --> 00:21:23.270]  Now, all of this said, governments and corporations and institutions
[00:21:23.757 --> 00:21:25.278]  Are stockpiling food and weapons.
[00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:26.059]  They're digging in.
[00:21:26.079 --> 00:21:26.860]  They're getting bunkers.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.484]  Elites are fleeing to places like New Zealand en masse.
[00:21:31.644 --> 00:21:44.896]  We've gone from financial meltdown and huge regional wars being a possibility to being a probability to more and more becoming an inevitability.
[00:21:46.058 --> 00:21:48.720]  Now, the big question is, what are we going to do about it?
[00:21:49.704 --> 00:21:53.987]  The advice I give you is the same advice that I carry out in my own personal life.
[00:21:55.728 --> 00:21:58.449]  Number one, everybody needs to be able to protect themselves.
[00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:01.351]  Everybody needs friends and family they can rely on in crises.
[00:22:01.971 --> 00:22:06.014]  And everyone needs high quality storable foods and high quality water filtration systems.
[00:22:06.614 --> 00:22:08.495]  Not just for collapse when it comes to water filters.
[00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:13.438]  All the garbage in our water, you'd be insane to drink well water or tap water with the glyphosates and all the rest of it.
[00:22:13.859 --> 00:22:18.561]  But we're offering the biggest wide spectrum sale ever on preparedness items.
[00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:23.671]  That's the lowest savings to 40% at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:22:24.191 --> 00:22:31.535]  On Infowars Select, high quality storable foods, the highest quality, the lowest prices, powered by My Patriot Supply.
[00:22:31.555 --> 00:22:33.876]  We also sell their food as well, their full spectrum.
[00:22:34.216 --> 00:22:36.818]  And all of their water filtration systems across the board.
[00:22:37.158 --> 00:22:42.861]  From gravity fed systems like Alexa Pure and Pro Pure, to shower filters, to survival straws,
[00:22:43.328 --> 00:22:49.533]  You name it, it's all 20-40% off right through July 4th at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:22:50.134 --> 00:22:51.815]  I know, I personally am getting prepared.
[00:22:52.375 --> 00:22:53.756]  The warning signs are insane.
[00:22:54.257 --> 00:23:01.262]  Take advantage, 20-40% off until early next week with the 4th of July Holiday Special at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:23:03.564 --> 00:23:07.948]  There are plans here in Texas for a high-speed rail project between Dallas and Houston.
[00:23:08.658 --> 00:23:14.202]  Now that would not be national news, but what is national news is the process of eminent domain.
[00:23:14.503 --> 00:23:16.945]  This is something that is going to happen in your community.
[00:23:16.985 --> 00:23:25.792]  This is a glimpse of how large corporations and the federal government are coming into a state and running roughshod over the rights of individuals.
[00:23:25.832 --> 00:23:28.133]  Joining us now is Judge Ben Lamont.
[00:23:28.173 --> 00:23:30.836]  He is a Grimes County, Texas judge.
[00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:35.019]  We're talking to Judge Lamont because he is one of a number of people
[00:23:35.599 --> 00:23:41.003]  County judges that we've talked to and others who are concerned about the Texas Central Rail Project.
[00:23:41.043 --> 00:23:51.369]  This is a high-speed rail project that's going to be running between Houston and Dallas and it's an issue of national concern because this shows us what is going on with eminent domain.
[00:23:51.409 --> 00:23:55.732]  This process that is being shut down by major corporations.
[00:23:56.312 --> 00:23:59.255]  How they're railroading people in small areas like this.
[00:23:59.275 --> 00:24:02.719]  And understand, this isn't just about the rights of the few.
[00:24:02.739 --> 00:24:08.304]  They're going to be coming after your rights as well this way if we don't get the process right.
[00:24:08.825 --> 00:24:17.654]  If the people who are involved here are not compensated fairly, if they don't have full due process, they will do this to you, wherever you live in this country.
[00:24:17.714 --> 00:24:30.856]  This is a foreign corporation that's coming in here, a Japanese corporation that's coming in here, allied with big business, big government, railroading this literally through the central parts of Texas, through these small towns, and these people want to have a say.
[00:24:31.116 --> 00:24:33.297]  So joining us now is Judge Ben Lamont.
[00:24:33.317 --> 00:24:34.617]  Thank you so much for joining us, Judge.
[00:24:36.057 --> 00:24:36.617]  No problem.
[00:24:36.657 --> 00:24:37.338]  Glad to be here.
[00:24:37.638 --> 00:24:39.058]  Tell us a little bit about the history of this.
[00:24:39.118 --> 00:24:40.218]  How did this all come about?
[00:24:40.258 --> 00:24:42.098]  How did you first learn about this?
[00:24:42.138 --> 00:24:44.939]  How was it received by the community when they learned about this?
[00:24:47.082 --> 00:24:52.307]  I first learned about it approximately, I guess December of 2014, somewhere towards the end of 2014.
[00:24:55.647 --> 00:24:58.769]  And it was, of course, not received well by many people.
[00:24:59.769 --> 00:25:08.233]  We learned that, as it was promoted at the time, was that it would go along or go in existing rights-of-way.
[00:25:08.493 --> 00:25:09.894]  That's how it was initially promoted.
[00:25:10.314 --> 00:25:17.818]  Along with existing things like existing railroad beds or highways that were already there that they would not need to cut through new paths through private property.
[00:25:19.364 --> 00:25:20.065]  That's correct.
[00:25:20.665 --> 00:25:42.346]  For the most part, the bulk of the project, there might have been a small part of the project that did not go in an existing easement, but the vast majority of it was promoted and marketed as if it was going to go in existing rights of way, like a transmission line, or ride in the existing right of way of an existing railroad.
[00:25:43.363 --> 00:25:45.184]  And then you found out that they're not going to do that.
[00:25:45.244 --> 00:25:46.945]  As a matter of fact, they've got two routes.
[00:25:46.965 --> 00:25:55.331]  They haven't even decided which routes are going to go down, and yet they want to condemn property and confiscate property in both of these routes, even though they don't know which route is going down.
[00:25:55.571 --> 00:26:01.735]  Tell us a little bit about how they are skirting the typical process for eminent domain and what that process would be.
[00:26:03.336 --> 00:26:04.216]  Sure, sure.
[00:26:04.937 --> 00:26:06.418]  And this is a very complicated
[00:26:07.122 --> 00:26:08.202]  Project itself.
[00:26:08.282 --> 00:26:11.603]  It's unlike any other high-speed rail project.
[00:26:11.683 --> 00:26:19.024]  Obviously, this is a high-speed rail project, but what they are attempting to do is they're trying to get the jurisdiction to be the federal government.
[00:26:19.064 --> 00:26:20.204]  That's the first issue.
[00:26:20.744 --> 00:26:23.145]  This clearly is a state project.
[00:26:23.285 --> 00:26:27.305]  Should be regulated by the state of Texas, not the federal government.
[00:26:27.725 --> 00:26:29.626]  This is an intrastate project.
[00:26:29.666 --> 00:26:30.926]  It goes from point to point.
[00:26:30.966 --> 00:26:36.227]  Dallas to Houston does not connect into any other transportation mode that then in turn goes
[00:26:37.027 --> 00:26:37.428]  I think so.
[00:26:55.293 --> 00:27:04.507]  Well, they are the front company, I guess is what you would call the face company of this project, I believe is incorporated in Delaware.
[00:27:04.948 --> 00:27:06.510]  All the bulk of the financial
[00:27:08.294 --> 00:27:17.196]  I mean, maybe 99% of the financing of this has been committed from Japanese Bank of International Cooperation.
[00:27:17.296 --> 00:27:20.077]  So, definitely Japanese-backed project.
[00:27:20.157 --> 00:27:22.958]  It's a Japanese-trained, Japanese business.
[00:27:23.038 --> 00:27:24.158]  It's Japanese government.
[00:27:24.518 --> 00:27:27.139]  That's the Japan Bank of International Cooperation.
[00:27:27.159 --> 00:27:33.061]  That's a state government over a state entity, and they are committing to financing the whole project.
[00:27:33.461 --> 00:27:34.461]  So, the front
[00:27:35.442 --> 00:27:44.248]  Organization the face front is is this they claim to be a Texas organization, but it's really a front for Japanese interests.
[00:27:44.388 --> 00:27:50.052]  So you got the federal government exerting authority here in an area that is clearly self-contained inside the state of Texas.
[00:27:50.072 --> 00:27:51.353]  They should not have any involvement.
[00:27:51.674 --> 00:27:56.937]  What is the federal government doing to shut down normal regulations and to shut down the normal process?
[00:27:58.538 --> 00:28:01.040]  So far the federal government hasn't taken any action.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.021]  So what's happened is
[00:28:03.254 --> 00:28:08.456]  This Texas Central Railway has filed two petitions with the Surface Transportation Board.
[00:28:08.916 --> 00:28:29.605]  The first petition, and these are the mechanisms they are using to try to circumvent the normal procedures that are, they being Texas Central Railway, trying to circumvent the normal procedures that ensure the due process and adequate compensation, fair compensation for the instances you were describing before.
[00:28:29.705 --> 00:28:29.825]  So,
[00:28:30.425 --> 00:28:40.489]  These two petitions they're filing are, the first one is a petition for clarification and the second one is a petition for exemption of particular rate of certain regulations.
[00:28:40.969 --> 00:28:42.049]  So I'll take them one at a time.
[00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:49.632]  The petition for clarification is simply asking for what they call a clarification, but it's really rewriting law.
[00:28:50.212 --> 00:28:58.795]  It's a clarification to make apparent that condemnation
[00:28:59.759 --> 00:29:04.841]  Is not part of the quote-unquote defined construction process, okay?
[00:29:05.201 --> 00:29:18.167]  So, historically speaking, construction, the definition of construction in the context of the Surface Transportation Board is backed up by case law, it is, includes condemnation.
[00:29:18.327 --> 00:29:25.971]  And so, they're asking for a clarification to exclude condemnation or the first half of condemnation
[00:29:27.702 --> 00:29:29.523]  From the definition of construction.
[00:29:30.023 --> 00:29:33.124]  So essentially what we've got here in Texas is a two-step process, right?
[00:29:33.144 --> 00:29:34.045]  We've got Texas Two-Step.
[00:29:34.385 --> 00:29:38.387]  They want to get rid of that first step completely and streamline this process, right?
[00:29:40.347 --> 00:29:41.808]  Well, they want to get rid of multiple steps.
[00:29:41.828 --> 00:29:48.151]  So that's the first part, and the exemption from regulations would then allow them to do things out of sequence.
[00:29:48.551 --> 00:29:55.494]  For instance, it would allow them, very clearly, asking for the ability to initiate the condemnation process
[00:29:56.014 --> 00:30:21.967]  Before they have a defined route, as you said earlier, they don't have a defined route yet, before the environmental impact study is complete, before the project has ever even been approved by the federal government or state government, before they have their financial package reviewed to make sure that the money is there to actually not end up halfway down the road and not enough money to complete the project.
[00:30:22.407 --> 00:30:34.709]  There's a whole series of regulations that normally occur in a sequence for a project of this nature, especially a startup company that's never operated and still does not operate a high-speed rail to this day.
[00:30:34.729 --> 00:30:35.249]  Wow.
[00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:50.192]  So, they are asking clearly, and in their petition, they clearly acknowledge on a sworn, verified statement from the CEO, Tim Keith, that they understand this could result, that they would condemn properties, or could condemn properties.
[00:30:50.632 --> 00:30:53.216]  That they would not even need for this.
[00:30:53.497 --> 00:30:55.941]  Well let me ask you about that because we've only got a couple of minutes left.
[00:30:56.787 --> 00:31:07.832]  If they take your property, because we can talk about what happens when they come through and perhaps, I guess, just compensate people for the swath of land that they take, but they might cut somebody's property in half.
[00:31:08.352 --> 00:31:14.335]  They also affect the real estate values throughout the community when they run that high-speed train rail through there, lowering their values.
[00:31:14.435 --> 00:31:16.256]  Those people, I guess, would not be compensated.
[00:31:16.476 --> 00:31:19.738]  But what about the people that they take their land and they don't even use it for the railroad?
[00:31:19.758 --> 00:31:20.458]  What happens then?
[00:31:20.918 --> 00:31:28.725]  Will they be able to later then sell that as a higher price after the value goes up and people find that it's not going to have a railroad running through it?
[00:31:30.817 --> 00:31:31.718]  It's a good point.
[00:31:32.498 --> 00:31:35.862]  The real damage is caused by the disruption of somebody's life.
[00:31:36.262 --> 00:31:38.064]  By then, everybody's had to move away.
[00:31:38.104 --> 00:31:38.605]  They're gone.
[00:31:38.625 --> 00:31:44.631]  They moved and changed their whole life to go around this railroad project that didn't even happen.
[00:31:45.091 --> 00:31:46.613]  I don't know how you undo that damage.
[00:31:46.813 --> 00:31:49.936]  I don't think you can, and there's not a price tag associated with it.
[00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:57.333]  Broken part of the condemnation process for this particular project is we've never had a high-speed rail.
[00:31:57.873 --> 00:32:16.723]  So the condemnation process, as it stands today in Texas for a project of this nature, you could have a situation, let's say if somebody had 500 acres and their house was, you know, let's say 6,000 feet away from the rail line, you could have somebody that's across the street, maybe 300 feet away from it,
[00:32:17.615 --> 00:32:17.895]  Yeah.
[00:32:17.935 --> 00:32:18.116]  Wow.
[00:32:47.676 --> 00:32:48.857]  Thank you so much, Judge.
[00:32:48.897 --> 00:32:49.999]  Good luck in your fight.
[00:32:50.099 --> 00:32:55.146]  And again, your chairman of the Texans Against High-Speed Rail, Judge Ben Lamon.
[00:32:55.367 --> 00:32:56.048]  Thank you so much.
[00:32:56.228 --> 00:32:56.749]  Good luck to you.
[00:32:57.169 --> 00:32:57.510]  Thank you.
[00:33:17.489 --> 00:33:23.450]  People desperate for staples like milk, rice and flour stormed a supermarket warehouse in Guayana City.
[00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:32.892]  If you go back to 2007, the British Ministry of Defense came out and echoed a Department of Defense report from here in the U.S.
[00:33:32.912 --> 00:33:44.434]  saying that beginning in the year 2016, right through 2020 to 2030, that they believe there would be massive multi-hundred percent food price increases worldwide.
[00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:53.300]  And that during that global meltdown that there would be incredible social unrest that would depopulate much of the earth.
[00:33:54.309 --> 00:34:04.918]  Now, in 2016, Vice Magazine and other publications are reporting on a 2015 report produced by the U.S.
[00:34:04.958 --> 00:34:17.769]  government, the U.N., and scores of foreign nations, as well as the State Department, overseen by food giant Cargill, the World Bank, and most importantly, the World Wildlife Fund.
[00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:19.430]  The World Wildlife Fund
[00:34:20.211 --> 00:34:28.505]  He's a eugenics anti-human organization set up by Prince Bernhard who also founded the Bilderberg Group and who was a Nazi officer.
[00:34:29.126 --> 00:34:30.708]  In this new FEMA report...
[00:34:31.633 --> 00:34:38.219]  With headline, FEMA contractor predicts social unrest caused by 395% food price spikes.
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:52.312]  You learn that this is a report filed with governments and major institutions overseen by a contractor that since the 1940s has been the main advisor for the US Navy Marine Corps.
[00:34:52.733 --> 00:34:57.437]  Now, all of this said, governments and corporations and institutions
[00:34:57.921 --> 00:34:59.442]  Are stockpiling food and weapons.
[00:34:59.482 --> 00:35:00.223]  They're digging in.
[00:35:00.263 --> 00:35:01.024]  They're getting bunkers.
[00:35:01.404 --> 00:35:05.687]  Elites are fleeing to places like New Zealand en masse.
[00:35:05.807 --> 00:35:19.058]  We've gone from financial meltdown and huge regional wars being a possibility to being a probability to more and more becoming an inevitability.
[00:35:19.798 --> 00:35:22.521]  Number one, everybody needs to be able to protect themselves.
[00:35:22.681 --> 00:35:25.363]  Everybody needs friends and family they can rely on in crises.
[00:35:26.041 --> 00:35:30.085]  And everyone needs high-quality storable foods and high-quality water filtration systems.
[00:35:30.525 --> 00:35:35.209]  But we're offering the biggest wide-spectrum sale ever on preparedness items.

[00:35:46.779 --> 00:35:49.081]  We also sell their food as well, their full spectrum.
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:58.046]  And all of their water filtration systems across the board, from gravity-fed systems like Alexa Pure and Pro Pure, to shower filters, to survival straws.
[00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:04.752]  You name it, it's all 20-40% off right through July 4th at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:36:05.312 --> 00:36:07.013]  I know, I personally am getting prepared.
[00:36:07.573 --> 00:36:08.954]  The warning signs are insane.
[00:36:09.454 --> 00:36:16.476]  Take advantage, 20-40% off until early next week with the 4th of July Holiday Special at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:36:16.676 --> 00:36:24.539]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:36:24.799 --> 00:36:26.760]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.662]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:36:29.723 --> 00:36:33.826]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:36:34.147 --> 00:36:37.309]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:36:37.329 --> 00:36:44.596]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:36:44.776 --> 00:36:48.920]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.741]  We are the true media.
[00:36:50.902 --> 00:36:53.484]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:36:53.584 --> 00:36:57.245]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:36:57.345 --> 00:37:01.466]  Join us at Infowarsnews.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:03.487 --> 00:37:07.448]  I was there at the beginning, inside the Clinton machine.
[00:37:08.468 --> 00:37:13.070]  I saw it all happen, from the corrupt to the absolutely corrupt.
[00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:18.692]  And that's when I thought about my father, who was dying of lung cancer.
[00:37:20.392 --> 00:37:23.033]  And what he would do if he knew the man I'd become.
[00:37:24.409 --> 00:37:25.930]  And then I thought about my daughter.
[00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:31.633]  What if the cocaine they were bringing in was to end up getting used by her?
[00:37:33.293 --> 00:37:36.715]  I hit my knees that day and asked God to forgive me.
[00:37:37.876 --> 00:37:39.016]  I wasn't a good person.
[00:37:39.956 --> 00:37:43.598]  I worked in special operations in Central America, South America.
[00:37:43.998 --> 00:37:45.299]  I did a lot of bad things.
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:50.502]  But I hit the bottom that day and said I was gonna make up for it.
[00:37:50.882 --> 00:37:51.202]  And now...
[00:37:52.509 --> 00:37:55.570]  I just want to see these criminals brought to justice.
[00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:57.490]  And get their just due.
[00:37:58.951 --> 00:38:00.011]  Not make Preston.
[00:38:01.631 --> 00:38:03.032]  But put where they belong.
[00:38:04.272 --> 00:38:04.812]  In jail.
[00:38:11.694 --> 00:38:13.074]  One thing about Hillary.
[00:38:14.835 --> 00:38:16.655]  Bill was just a good-timing guy.
[00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:18.456]  But Hillary?
[00:38:19.416 --> 00:38:20.016]  She's an animal.
[00:38:22.854 --> 00:38:24.616]  And I tell you right now...
[00:38:52.879 --> 00:39:01.085]  I will stop Hillary.
[00:39:01.106 --> 00:39:05.969]  We've gone further than anybody we know of, and that's all we're going to say.
[00:39:06.029 --> 00:39:10.273]  And people can ask us a hundred different ways, you know, from a hundred different directions.
[00:39:11.213 --> 00:39:14.376]  And we're just going to leave the ultimate decision up to the American people.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:25.742]  I really just want everybody to take a deep breath and relax and just, you know, sit back because here they come again.
[00:39:25.822 --> 00:39:32.323]  We're going to have to just ride through this as we have so many of these other false accusations.
[00:39:36.223 --> 00:39:38.744]  Let me get the air clear about this.
[00:39:41.444 --> 00:39:44.205]  The email scandal, I believe,
[00:39:45.871 --> 00:39:47.792]  It was brought out by the Clintons.
[00:39:49.473 --> 00:40:00.978]  Now, I would be pleased to talk more about this important matter, but I know there have been questions about my email, so I want to address that directly, and then I will take a few questions from you.
[00:40:01.538 --> 00:40:10.502]  You see, we knew running for election, you never want to run as the anointed one.
[00:40:11.703 --> 00:40:14.124]  You always want to run as the underdog.
[00:40:15.933 --> 00:40:20.716]  Now it's kind of hard when you're building Hillary Clinton with all the hoopla and who they are now.
[00:40:20.796 --> 00:40:22.557]  How do you get to be the underdog?
[00:40:23.517 --> 00:40:29.461]  If you look at the email scandal, where did the email scandal come from?
[00:40:29.961 --> 00:40:31.102]  The New York Times.
[00:40:33.023 --> 00:40:39.667]  The New York Times has never been anything but a PR firm for the Clintons.
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:48.527]  Even if they had it, there's no way the New York Times would have broke a story about Hillary that could have damaged her.
[00:40:49.828 --> 00:40:50.869]  But look what she's done.
[00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:58.257]  They have used the email scandal to catapult them into an underdog status.
[00:40:59.409 --> 00:41:10.857]  Now, as we get closer to the election, when you get through the primary, and you get into the general election, I can tell you, New York Times, read my lips.
[00:41:11.498 --> 00:41:12.899]  Go ahead and write the article.
[00:41:12.939 --> 00:41:14.039]  It's probably already written.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.543]  Right when they get into the general election, you know what they're going to say?
[00:41:18.583 --> 00:41:22.846]  They're going to say, oh, we've checked all this out, and it turns out there was nothing to it.
[00:41:24.847 --> 00:41:25.888]  That's what's going to happen.
[00:41:26.528 --> 00:41:29.431]  It's all used to stage Hillary.
[00:41:29.571 --> 00:41:34.014]  Now, if you don't believe me, remember when Hillary ran against Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:41:35.816 --> 00:41:39.439]  She should have used our system then, but she didn't.
[00:41:40.099 --> 00:41:43.021]  She came in and she was the anointed one.
[00:41:44.282 --> 00:41:44.883]  And he whooped her.
[00:41:45.944 --> 00:41:47.445]  She's not making that mistake this time.
[00:41:48.823 --> 00:41:55.766]  And by the way, if you notice, Hillary's also done the other thing you have to do at the formative stage of a campaign.
[00:41:55.846 --> 00:41:59.928]  She's gone around, she's sucked up all of the money that's out there.
[00:41:59.948 --> 00:42:04.370]  So anybody tries to run against her, I hear people ask me, what do you think about Biden?
[00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:06.171]  I don't think about anybody.
[00:42:06.211 --> 00:42:07.812]  What are they going to run against her with?
[00:42:08.752 --> 00:42:10.573]  They have already laid claim to the money.
[00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:26.633]  Once the American public begins to see the emails, they will have an unprecedented insight into a high government official's daily communications, which I think will be quite interesting.
[00:42:27.853 --> 00:42:32.894]  You may have seen that I recently launched a Snapchat account.
[00:42:33.094 --> 00:42:36.294]  Those messages disappear all by themselves.
[00:42:37.234 --> 00:42:40.735]  You see, when Hillary gets in office within six months,
[00:42:42.688 --> 00:42:52.373]  According to the plan we wrote back in 1986, literally there's a plan called the 86 plan, and it's where we finalized and put everything down.
[00:42:53.254 --> 00:42:57.736]  Within six months, she will make Bill ambassador to the UN.
[00:42:58.796 --> 00:43:05.240]  When Bill gets to be ambassador to the UN, it won't be six months then.
[00:43:06.636 --> 00:43:15.019]  Because of the Clinton Foundation, what they've used the Clinton Foundation for, it won't be six months until he's made Secretary General of the UN.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:21.022]  Now can you imagine the power Bill and Hillary have?
[00:43:21.042 --> 00:43:29.945]  I mean, they will have achieved more power
[00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:36.434]  Than any couple in the history of the world, when they pull that stunt.
[00:43:38.415 --> 00:43:45.401]  On January 20th, 1993, William Jefferson Clinton became the 42nd President of the United States.
[00:43:46.281 --> 00:43:50.885]  At the time, most Americans were not aware of the extent of Clinton's criminal background.
[00:43:51.485 --> 00:43:55.769]  Nor were they aware of the media blackout, which kept this information from the public.
[00:43:56.784 --> 00:44:07.210]  As State Attorney General and later Governor, Bill Clinton in 12 years achieved absolute control over the political, legal, and financial systems of Arkansas.
[00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:14.754]  As President, he would attempt to do the same with the nation by bringing members of his inner circle with him to Washington.
[00:44:15.414 --> 00:44:22.418]  The hijacking of America was underway, and its impact on future generations would be incalculable.
[00:44:24.867 --> 00:44:32.076]  It was years, years ago when I was picked up by a man named Mr. Whit Stevens.
[00:44:32.677 --> 00:44:37.883]  And Mr. Whit was the brother to Jack Stevens, Jackson Stevens.
[00:44:38.223 --> 00:44:41.287]  And they were
[00:44:42.802 --> 00:44:44.664]  The kingmakers in Arkansas.
[00:44:45.324 --> 00:44:48.807]  So they called me one day and said, we need to meet with you.
[00:44:48.827 --> 00:44:59.496]  And I met with them and they said, we need you to take a look-see at a guy that we think we can make governor.
[00:45:00.857 --> 00:45:07.323]  And we want him to be the youngest governor in the history of the country.
[00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:15.894]  So I agreed and that's when I met Bill.
[00:45:17.034 --> 00:45:32.824]  When I met with him it was kind of weird because I was talking to him and he was chasing after the waitresses and I would try to get his focus
[00:45:34.326 --> 00:45:37.107]  And all he would do is just chase after the waitress, just watch.
[00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:38.368]  Man, I want some of that.
[00:45:38.448 --> 00:45:39.668]  Man, I want some of that.
[00:45:39.748 --> 00:45:42.129]  And it just went on and on and on.
[00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:52.634]  And finally to the point where I had actually gotten a little bit perturbed about it and said, man, we've got to figure this out.
[00:45:53.454 --> 00:45:54.455]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:45:54.475 --> 00:45:57.076]  And he was attorney general at the time.
[00:45:59.136 --> 00:46:04.879]  And so I went back the next day to Mr. Witt and told him what I thought.
[00:46:04.939 --> 00:46:10.622]  I said, Mr. Witt, this guy is a sexual predator.
[00:46:11.882 --> 00:46:13.263]  He's not just a womanizer.
[00:46:13.283 --> 00:46:15.084]  I mean, I'm telling you, this guy's sick.
[00:46:16.845 --> 00:46:19.866]  And he's a pathological liar.
[00:46:20.307 --> 00:46:20.587]  I mean,
[00:46:21.866 --> 00:46:25.487]  And I told Mr. Witt, I couldn't even make him tell the truth.
[00:46:26.107 --> 00:46:32.948]  And when it came to something he could tell the truth on that would be harmless to him, he still couldn't tell.
[00:46:35.088 --> 00:46:40.289]  Well, Mr. Witt said, you can break him of that.
[00:46:40.389 --> 00:46:42.270]  We'll have a talk.
[00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:44.330]  So I figured, what the heck.
[00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:48.271]  A couple, three weeks passed.
[00:46:49.778 --> 00:46:50.899]  They met with Bill.
[00:46:50.979 --> 00:46:54.041]  Apparently they got everything worked out the way they wanted it.
[00:46:55.943 --> 00:46:59.305]  And he was in the game running for governor.
[00:47:05.116 --> 00:47:09.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:16.704]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of brain force.
[00:47:16.944 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.407]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.

[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.

[00:49:04.522 --> 00:49:06.323]  I'm Margaret Hale for InfoWars.com.
[00:49:06.343 --> 00:49:15.986]  There's a new study coming out by the Center for Immigration Studies, which Jessica Vaughn, she's the policy director for that center, she asserts that nearly 1 million people are in the U.S.
[00:49:16.086 --> 00:49:19.708]  and they've been given orders to deport, to leave immediately.
[00:49:19.748 --> 00:49:20.568]  They're still staying.
[00:49:20.628 --> 00:49:21.989]  She lays out some reasons why.
[00:49:22.049 --> 00:49:23.529]  Let me get into these numbers for you.
[00:49:23.569 --> 00:49:27.191]  She says a small fraction of the immigrants that are being detained by ICE
[00:49:28.291 --> 00:49:30.732]  They're actually on an ordered removal list.
[00:49:30.852 --> 00:49:37.214]  She's citing 925,193 aliens are still here despite those deportation orders.
[00:49:37.834 --> 00:49:39.334]  And she lists some reasons why.
[00:49:39.454 --> 00:49:40.335]  She says that the U.S.
[00:49:40.375 --> 00:49:42.555]  officials, they feel constrained on how to release them.
[00:49:42.935 --> 00:49:45.456]  They feel pressure from the feds to go ahead and release them.
[00:49:45.536 --> 00:49:51.898]  Then you have sanctuary cities that thwart deportations and other issues that the host country simply won't take.
[00:49:52.438 --> 00:49:52.678]  This is
[00:50:12.825 --> 00:50:16.329]  I want to take you to one case in particular that's breaking in Oregon.
[00:50:16.349 --> 00:50:23.157]  One of these 170,000 convicted that have not yet been deported is Bonifacio Asaguero Gonzalez.
[00:50:23.237 --> 00:50:29.625]  And this man has been accused of shooting four people in Oregon, killing three of the people that he actually shot.
[00:50:29.665 --> 00:50:32.488]  This happened on a blueberry farm outside of Woodburn, Oregon.
[00:50:33.169 --> 00:50:38.112]  And ICE put a written statement out of the accused, of Mr. Oseguera.
[00:50:38.152 --> 00:50:41.754]  This is what they had to say about the situation that he's in.
[00:50:41.794 --> 00:50:43.495]  And you're not even going to believe this.
[00:50:43.535 --> 00:50:45.816]  He was deported five times.
[00:50:45.876 --> 00:50:48.518]  This is his sixth entry into the U.S.
[00:50:48.538 --> 00:50:51.380]  where he's killed three people and seriously injured a fourth.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:56.723]  They say, after conducting a comprehensive review of Mr. Oseguera's immigration and criminal history, U.S.
[00:50:57.503 --> 00:51:02.046]  Immigration and Customs to that end, the agency filed a notice of action with the Marion County Jail
[00:51:02.626 --> 00:51:11.268]  Asking to be alerted if or when Mr. Asaguera is slated for release so the agency can take custody or pursue further administrative enforcement action.
[00:51:11.428 --> 00:51:17.250]  Relevant databases indicate Mr. Asaguera has no significant prior criminal convictions.
[00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:22.791]  However, he has been repatriated to Mexico six times since 2003, most recently in 2013.
[00:51:25.592 --> 00:51:27.113]  Let me see if I get this straight.
[00:51:27.173 --> 00:51:32.797]  He was deported six times, gained successful reentry and then subsequently killed three people.
[00:51:32.817 --> 00:51:34.238]  That's what we're talking about here.
[00:51:34.278 --> 00:51:41.183]  This was the official statement that they were unsuccessfully able to repatriate him back to his host country for whatever reason.
[00:51:41.483 --> 00:51:48.107]  And, uh, if that doesn't spell out a system that is indescribably broken, I don't know what does that specific case.
[00:51:49.048 --> 00:51:49.669]  We're good to go.
[00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:24.912]  I want to take you to a story now coming out of Memphis regarding the TSA.
[00:52:24.932 --> 00:52:28.975]  You know those agents that have been deputized to act basically like police officers?
[00:52:29.475 --> 00:52:33.958]  What they did to one young woman and their care is absolutely despicable to me.
[00:52:33.998 --> 00:52:35.119]  It makes me so sick.
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:38.822]  I'm trying hard not to use profanity on the air anymore because I told my mom I wouldn't.
[00:52:38.862 --> 00:52:40.043]  We're talking about a case.
[00:52:40.903 --> 00:52:47.029]  Uh, with a young lady, she's 19 years old, she's disabled, she's blind in one eye, partially paralyzed and deaf.
[00:52:47.709 --> 00:52:51.793]  And as she was traveling through the Memphis airport, I'm speaking of a young woman named Hannah Cohen.
[00:52:52.393 --> 00:52:53.714]  She was going to St.
[00:52:53.734 --> 00:52:57.478]  Jude Hospital in Chattanooga, the to and from trip, Chattanooga, Memphis.
[00:52:57.938 --> 00:52:59.218]  To treat her brain tumor.
[00:52:59.679 --> 00:53:07.341]  She goes through the TSA checkpoint, sets off the metal detector alarm, to which she freaks out understandably.
[00:53:07.782 --> 00:53:16.124]  Her mother said that she didn't know what was going on, gets confused very easily, and then she tries to run.
[00:53:16.285 --> 00:53:19.726]  She resists the TSA arrest of her, if you will.
[00:53:20.626 --> 00:53:25.831]  To which a TSA officer then grabs her, slams her head to the ground to the point where she's bleeding.
[00:53:25.851 --> 00:53:30.475]  I encourage you to go and look at these photographs online for a more in-depth report of Hannah's story.
[00:53:30.495 --> 00:53:34.678]  Her skull, you can actually see blood dripping from her head.
[00:53:34.698 --> 00:53:41.664]  It was all over the floor, bashing her head that had a brain tumor in it that she was getting treated for, bashing it on the floor.
[00:53:41.684 --> 00:53:43.226]  Hannah later gets arrested.
[00:53:43.986 --> 00:53:44.547]  I don't know.
[00:54:06.003 --> 00:54:15.926]  If they have special needs, well, okay, we'll just all be sure and remember to do that so that your head's not bashed into the ground the next time you're not sure what to do, you get disoriented or you freak out.
[00:54:16.006 --> 00:54:21.767]  Now, this story, it's reminiscent of the TSA expansion of authority regarding checkpoints.
[00:54:21.807 --> 00:54:28.789]  We've covered here on InfoWars the Ataturk airport bombing in Turkey and what this means for you and I at home.
[00:54:28.809 --> 00:54:32.850]  Now, we know the governments have, they have this big push that they're going to start
[00:54:33.655 --> 00:54:42.978]  Stepping up checkpoints, doing random searches, and we've covered this extensively this past week, but these TSA checkpoints, of course, they're for your safety.
[00:54:43.078 --> 00:54:45.719]  Everything that they're doing is just for your safety and security.
[00:54:45.759 --> 00:54:51.781]  It's not to, in any way, you know, abuse their power or authority, take away your basic rights.
[00:54:52.161 --> 00:54:54.042]  Don't worry, it's all just for you.
[00:54:54.082 --> 00:54:55.343]  But here's what they're going to try to do.
[00:54:55.503 --> 00:54:59.264]  So, they're going to set up these checkpoints in the parking lot.
[00:54:59.944 --> 00:55:00.525]  I think?
[00:55:22.122 --> 00:55:26.384]  We found a clip of this in our Infowars Encyclopedia videos, if you will.
[00:55:26.404 --> 00:55:30.045]  We found a clip of this 2009 Tennessee TSA.
[00:55:30.085 --> 00:55:37.168]  A brief clip for you, where the TSA was taking to the streets, randomly stopping people and searching cars.
[00:55:37.528 --> 00:55:37.948]  Take a look.
[00:55:38.649 --> 00:55:43.130]  You're probably used to seeing these signature blue uniforms at the airport.
[00:55:45.451 --> 00:55:49.373]  But now, TSA agents are on the interstates fighting terrorism
[00:55:49.744 --> 00:55:54.225]  With visible intermodal prevention and response, or VIPER operations.
[00:55:54.825 --> 00:55:56.966]  Where is a terrorist most apt to be found?
[00:55:57.426 --> 00:56:00.287]  Not these days on an airplane, more likely on the interstate.
[00:56:00.607 --> 00:56:08.089]  Tuesday, Tennessee was the first to do this simultaneously, at five way stations and two bus stations statewide.
[00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:12.350]  The TSA using their power for good, all in the name of just keeping us safe.
[00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:15.371]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:56:17.125 --> 00:56:18.566]  Well that's it for our show tonight.
[00:56:18.606 --> 00:56:21.507]  I definitely encourage you to have a fun and safe 4th of July.
[00:56:21.527 --> 00:56:25.669]  I'm Jakari Jackson from the Info Wars Command Center and we'll see you again next week.
[00:56:31.612 --> 00:56:36.454]  As a community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.
[00:56:39.389 --> 00:56:48.056]  That's veteran Denver Police Officer Charles Jones IV smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times.
[00:56:48.617 --> 00:56:52.900]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect and then trying to erase the evidence.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:55.642]  I'm observing what they're doing and they're all seeing me!
[00:56:55.662 --> 00:56:57.504]  I don't understand what's going on!
[00:56:57.524 --> 00:57:07.252]  A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio, and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[00:57:08.132 --> 00:57:15.618]  Does it raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government?
[00:57:15.879 --> 00:57:17.140]  How can you ask such a question?
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:20.342]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:57:20.382 --> 00:57:27.448]  When a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in a community, he looks beyond fine words and noble phrases.
[00:57:27.468 --> 00:57:35.115]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:38.244]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[00:57:38.464 --> 00:57:39.627]  What I say go.
[00:57:39.827 --> 00:57:40.168]  See?
[00:57:40.989 --> 00:57:42.412]  I'm the law around here.
[00:57:42.432 --> 00:57:47.462]  He came, you saw, he died.
[00:57:50.126 --> 00:57:56.409]  Yes, in modern warfare, our military leaders are finding that words and ideas are highly effective weapons.
[00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:58.590]  We just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:05.653]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:58:06.033 --> 00:58:08.174]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[00:58:08.454 --> 00:58:09.935]  You really don't have to trust me.
[00:58:09.955 --> 00:58:10.755]  You shouldn't trust me.
[00:58:10.795 --> 00:58:14.337]  In fact, by my actually participating that, I will taint the news.
[00:58:14.877 --> 00:58:18.218]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[00:58:20.019 --> 00:58:25.966]  Nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[00:58:25.986 --> 00:58:29.210]  Okay, Miss Hughes, well, we're gonna do everything we can to help you.
[00:58:31.181 --> 00:58:34.662]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:58:35.262 --> 00:58:37.663]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:37.943 --> 00:58:39.403]  Because there is a war on.
[00:58:40.004 --> 00:58:40.684]  For your mind.
[00:58:41.084 --> 00:58:48.886]  We celebrate the 4th of July as a reminder of earning our independence from a tyrannical and oppressive government.
[00:58:49.106 --> 00:58:55.648]  Just a reminder to the Obama administration, there's plenty of room on the calendar for another holiday.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.001]  Knockout is back.
[00:59:05.341 --> 00:59:16.447]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep, restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:16.847 --> 00:59:18.548]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:19.048 --> 00:59:28.173]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:28.573 --> 00:59:30.334]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:30.894 --> 00:59:31.775]  It's the same price
[00:59:32.395 --> 00:59:34.476]  You are watching the InfoWars Nightly News, which airs 7 p.m.
