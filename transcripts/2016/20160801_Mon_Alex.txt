[00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:12.768]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:12.768 --> 00:00:14.469]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:24.435]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:25.016]  We're live.
[00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:28.418]  It's August 1st, 2016.
[00:00:28.418 --> 00:00:31.740]  We are three months and a week out from the general election.
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.380]  A hundred days.
[00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.484]  I was talking to Paul Joseph Watson this morning.
[00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:41.007]  And I said, what's your assessment of the world right now?
[00:00:41.007 --> 00:01:00.957]  And he said, we're going into a cycle of serious corruption, a cycle of collapse, a cycle of general insanity, because the world has become so unnatural and humanity is basically trying to get its balance.
[00:01:00.957 --> 00:01:07.860]  And the social engineers are using that imbalance to gain greater control.
[00:01:09.892 --> 00:01:13.093]  And I said, that's exactly what's going on.
[00:01:13.093 --> 00:01:16.534]  And I said, you understand, Paul, that we're not on a power trip at InfoWars.
[00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:19.774]  We have an incredible responsibility.
[00:01:19.774 --> 00:01:33.178]  And I told him a lot of things that no one else really knows in the crew of some of the really dangerous behind the scenes things going on.
[00:01:33.178 --> 00:01:38.079]  But I tell you, being involved in the highest levels of change globally,
[00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:45.130]  is a incredible responsibility.
[00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.733]  And it's like jumping 500 feet into freezing water.
[00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:58.918]  And you look around at the rest of the public who are basically in arrested development, living in a fantasy world, and it's scary.
[00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:08.804]  Even the supposedly focused individuals that are politically involved still aren't one-tenth as serious as they should be.
[00:02:10.683 --> 00:02:14.124]  And I understand we've been inducted into this matrix-like system from birth.
[00:02:14.124 --> 00:02:32.809]  It's getting more intense as we go, but man, the level of outright corruption and evil and the directed persecution of not just humanity and the genetic code of the different species, but the entire planet itself.
[00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:34.370]  It is beyond devilish.
[00:02:42.756 --> 00:02:45.037]  We're going to cover all this news today.
[00:02:45.037 --> 00:02:48.278]  And Joel Scouser is going to join us later in the middle of the broadcast, World Affairs Brief.
[00:02:48.278 --> 00:02:53.900]  Talk about the different things that are happening geopolitically.
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.382]  But the New World Order are masters at controlling narratives.
[00:02:57.382 --> 00:03:01.383]  And they put out a fake right-wing narrative, a fake left-wing narrative.
[00:03:01.383 --> 00:03:04.985]  That's what's done on a planetary scale.
[00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:09.327]  When I say transcend the left-right paradigm, a term I coined more than 20 years ago,
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:23.044]  I wasn't saying there isn't a left or a right, I'm saying normally the left and right are controlled, and that's what Carol Quigley wrote about at Georgetown.
[00:03:23.044 --> 00:03:35.149]  He said, it'll look like there's a difference on the surface, but beneath that there's really no difference and the same elites will control it, so that people will revolt through the political system, believing that they're going to have change, but the change never really comes.
[00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:40.512]  But you see, once you're aware of that paradigm, then it's the beginning of the end, and the globalists know that.
[00:03:41.297 --> 00:03:50.643]  And Brzezinski now says they've lost control of the Council on Foreign Relations, in three different speeches, and says it's just easier to start killing everybody than controlling them.
[00:03:50.643 --> 00:03:54.466]  He admits they're losing.
[00:03:54.466 --> 00:04:07.975]  So, the establishment's really discussing some hardcore stuff, like World War III, just to control populations, and World War III will be as much against the United States as it is against Russia.
[00:04:08.857 --> 00:04:20.066]  And folks have to transcend to the globalist mindset, or descend, depending on how you look at it, to see that they're attacking the nation-state.
[00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:29.073]  Now, I'm not saying we become globalist, but we have to think like a globalist, understand from a globalist perspective.
[00:04:29.073 --> 00:04:30.655]  Where are the serious men?
[00:04:30.655 --> 00:04:32.316]  Where are the serious women?
[00:04:32.316 --> 00:04:33.297]  Well, there aren't a lot of them.
[00:04:34.269 --> 00:04:41.696]  And so that's why InfoWars has become the counter-narrative to a great extent to the entire world government system.
[00:04:41.696 --> 00:04:56.149]  And I think you need to know that as listeners, not at some braggadocio point for the broadcast, but to actually examine the true danger we are all in because of the nature of this fight.
[00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:56.690]  Stay with us.
[00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.012]  We've got to replicate this data analysis quickly.
[00:05:00.778 --> 00:05:06.601]  Hillary Clinton suggested the grieving families of victims of the Benghazi attack are liars in an appearance on Fox News Sunday.
[00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:16.726]  While the corporate media obsessed over Donald Trump's response to a fallen soldier from a Muslim immigrant family, Clinton's response to Pat Smith over the death of her son in Libya was glossed over, as reported by Steve Watson.
[00:05:16.926 --> 00:05:23.410]  Clinton said, quote, I don't hold any ill feeling for someone who in that moment may not fully recall everything that was or wasn't said.
[00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:32.456]  Now that's a bold statement coming from Hillary's mouth considering the FBI revealed she lied numerous times about sending classified information over her unsecured private email server.
[00:05:32.456 --> 00:05:43.303]  Hillary's suggesting, once again, that families of the Benghazi victims didn't hear her properly when she told them the cause of the attack was an anti-Muslim YouTube video and that it was not a coordinated pre-planned terror attack.
[00:05:43.303 --> 00:05:45.705]  But private emails revealed Hillary knows the terrorist attack.
[00:05:45.865 --> 00:05:55.016]  And additionally, the whole story about the YouTube video was a State Department fabrication to cover up the Department's role in shipping living weapons to jihadists in Syria via Benghazi.
[00:05:55.016 --> 00:05:57.279]  For more reports, visit Infowars.com.
[00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:58.741]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:05:59.907 --> 00:06:03.108]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:06:03.108 --> 00:06:05.468]  Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:05.468 --> 00:06:12.470]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.791]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[00:06:17.791 --> 00:06:26.773]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[00:06:27.213 --> 00:06:36.097]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[00:06:36.097 --> 00:06:43.180]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spite G-Rex herbal processing technique.
[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.563]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs, backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you the best.
[00:06:49.743 --> 00:07:08.068]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[00:07:08.068 --> 00:07:08.889]  Here's why.
[00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:13.050]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.970]  So please listen.
[00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.391]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:24.034]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[00:07:24.034 --> 00:07:31.337]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[00:07:31.337 --> 00:07:33.698]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[00:07:33.698 --> 00:07:44.943]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast-charge solar generators, and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[00:07:45.263 --> 00:07:47.004]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[00:07:47.004 --> 00:07:48.685]  Go to gridwars.com.
[00:07:48.685 --> 00:07:50.426]  That's gridwars.com.
[00:07:50.426 --> 00:07:54.287]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[00:07:54.287 --> 00:07:55.848]  Go to gridwars.com.
[00:07:55.848 --> 00:08:03.592]  That's gridwars.com.
[00:08:03.592 --> 00:08:07.674]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:08:07.674 --> 00:08:09.735]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:16.135 --> 00:08:22.436]  I want to be deadly clear right here at the beginning of this broadcast.
[00:08:22.436 --> 00:08:26.537]  Planetary world government is being established.
[00:08:26.537 --> 00:08:44.640]  The controlling central bank's plan on extended worldwide depression, conflict, wars, and other crises to bring in the next phase after the organized collapse.
[00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:56.434]  Even the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times are admitting that we've had a recovery that was not a recovery.
[00:08:56.434 --> 00:09:06.298]  Even with cooked numbers, this nation is seeing 0.8 or 0.8 growth rates.
[00:09:06.298 --> 00:09:11.580]  That is certainly a multi-number negative when you understand they cook unemployment and other systems.
[00:09:17.276 --> 00:09:18.716]  This is organized.
[00:09:18.716 --> 00:09:26.219]  This is planned.
[00:09:26.219 --> 00:09:45.065]  We have to come to grips with the fact that only Donald Trump is even remotely talking about the reasons that this is happening, and that's why the entire power structure is against him.
[00:09:48.015 --> 00:10:04.119]  The social engineers, the culture controllers, are probing and are testing right now to see exactly how far they can push us.
[00:10:04.119 --> 00:10:13.841]  And much of the evidence shows they are trying to push us in a direction
[00:10:16.843 --> 00:10:20.146]  That will cause civil unrest.
[00:10:20.146 --> 00:10:28.274]  Now I know I'm stating a lot of obvious things here, but undoubtedly we are entering a time of intensified crisis.
[00:10:28.274 --> 00:10:37.102]  And if you think all of the escalation you've seen the last few years is serious, just get ready.
[00:10:37.102 --> 00:10:41.226]  Now the globalists are gambling to bring the world into this level of crisis because during this,
[00:10:42.701 --> 00:10:51.967]  There's going to be a lot of people that are exposing, like UKIP and Infowars and Drudge and others, exactly who the authors of this are.
[00:10:51.967 --> 00:10:54.609]  And the globalists are the authors of it.
[00:10:54.609 --> 00:11:06.097]  And so you're going to see massive political upheaval and populist movements that are bringing global government and the entire project of the New World Order to its knees.
[00:11:10.572 --> 00:11:14.954]  And what I'm trying to get across to you is things are bad.
[00:11:14.954 --> 00:11:15.754]  They're worse than bad.
[00:11:15.754 --> 00:11:17.575]  We're facing a scientific evil.
[00:11:17.575 --> 00:11:22.157]  But also things are really good because there is a serious awakening.
[00:11:22.157 --> 00:11:25.898]  It's moving faster and growing faster.
[00:11:25.898 --> 00:11:34.402]  And we're having big success against the technocrats across the board when we stand up, when we get involved.
[00:11:37.386 --> 00:11:38.507]  Now let me just do this.
[00:11:38.507 --> 00:11:47.353]  Let me just, again, try to just read you some of the top headlines that I'm going to be burrowing through in this hour, then taking your phone calls, then Joel Skousen joins us.
[00:11:47.353 --> 00:11:49.475]  Editor of World Affairs Brief.
[00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:54.959]  Exclusive, this is from Breitbart, but it's Aaron Klein with WorldNetDaily, who I saw at the DNC.
[00:11:54.959 --> 00:12:00.663]  I wish I would have asked William Benning this question, because when he was on a year ago, he talked about, we've got Hillary Clinton's emails.
[00:12:00.663 --> 00:12:02.985]  But he said it again, this time it's become a national news story.
[00:12:02.985 --> 00:12:05.087]  I want to get him back on this week to talk about it.
[00:12:05.087 --> 00:12:06.628]  Former Technical Director of the NSA.
[00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:13.741]  NSA architect agency has all of Clinton's deleted emails.
[00:12:13.741 --> 00:12:14.361]  Well, of course they do.
[00:12:14.361 --> 00:12:19.604]  Then he goes over the fact that he set up the program.
[00:12:19.604 --> 00:12:21.925]  Well, don't you know the Democrats have copies as well?
[00:12:21.925 --> 00:12:30.109]  Julian Assange hacked emails include info on Hillary's arming of jihadists, including ISIS in Syria.
[00:12:30.109 --> 00:12:31.710]  And the Russians are getting ready to release them.
[00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:38.030]  Jihadi shot a Russian helicopter down today.
[00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:53.658]  The Clinton Foundation, state and Kremlin connections, even the Wall Street Journal is saying, how dare Hillary come out with no evidence and say that Trump has some connection to the Russians when Hillary's been involved transferring uranium and high-tech chips.
[00:12:55.526 --> 00:12:57.327]  That's because they want war in the future.
[00:12:57.327 --> 00:13:11.295]  Hillary is in there with all the different parties engaged in every form of treason you can imagine at her foundation, getting hundreds of millions of dollars, 30 plus million dollars in one payment.
[00:13:11.295 --> 00:13:16.538]  Directly with Vladimir Putin getting technology.
[00:13:16.538 --> 00:13:23.722]  It was Hillary and it was Bill that helped transfer the nuclear reactors to North Korea, which were the type to make A-bombs.
[00:13:23.722 --> 00:13:24.603]  And don't even work as well.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.581]  He's stabilizing the world again.
[00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:32.006]  I mean, you talk about evil, and then she gets up there and goes, oh, I'm going to stabilize the world.
[00:13:32.006 --> 00:13:37.571]  And Bill Clinton says, you send her into an area, a country, a place in crisis, everything just gets better.
[00:13:37.571 --> 00:13:41.996]  This woman fixes things better than anybody I've ever seen.
[00:13:41.996 --> 00:13:48.022]  The crowd's, I mean, she shows up and everything basically blows up and burns down on purpose.
[00:13:49.434 --> 00:13:52.235]  She said, oh, I guess we did make Libya a failed state.
[00:13:52.235 --> 00:13:57.617]  That was the plan to begin with because it was stabilizing all of Africa.
[00:13:57.617 --> 00:14:06.539]  Muammar Gaddafi was actually investing all over Africa, tapping aquifers, putting in plants, building factories.
[00:14:06.539 --> 00:14:08.420]  He lived in a tent behind a 10-foot wall.
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:14.942]  I mean, I'm not saying he's perfect, but if you're going to have a philosopher king, the guy gave like 99% of the money from the oil directly to the people.
[00:14:15.987 --> 00:14:19.969]  They went and blew that up and put Al-Qaeda in charge, also known as ISIS.
[00:14:19.969 --> 00:14:21.050]  Oh, I said I'd just read the headlines.
[00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.910]  See, I can't.
[00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:25.912]  Oh, this is with the Clinton Foundation, State and Kremlin connections.
[00:14:25.912 --> 00:14:33.797]  Report Hillary Clinton campaign manager John Podesta sat on board of company that bagged $35 million from Putin, connected Russian fund.
[00:14:35.452 --> 00:14:36.233]  That doesn't matter.
[00:14:36.233 --> 00:14:41.136]  New York Post runs more naked photos of Trump's supermodel wife.
[00:14:41.136 --> 00:14:43.658]  That's what supermodels do, is pose with their tops off.
[00:14:43.658 --> 00:14:48.622]  You know, you've got all over the world paintings of women with their tops off.
[00:14:48.622 --> 00:14:49.822]  You've got sculptures of it.
[00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:55.647]  It's called appreciating the finer things that God has given us.
[00:14:55.647 --> 00:14:56.908]  I just want to have her as the first lady.
[00:14:56.908 --> 00:14:58.749]  I mean, that is awesome!
[00:14:58.749 --> 00:15:02.712]  Not some stuck-up weird communist or some other freakazoid.
[00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:08.542]  I'm not even going into this, just whatever the top story is.
[00:15:08.542 --> 00:15:10.523]  I'm just giving you what I sit here and look at.
[00:15:10.523 --> 00:15:14.165]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:15:14.165 --> 00:15:15.406]  Here's the economy stack.
[00:15:15.406 --> 00:15:20.329]  Seven years later, recovery remains the weakest of the post-World War II era.
[00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:21.510]  Because it's fake.
[00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:22.991]  And that's with fake numbers, as I said earlier.
[00:15:22.991 --> 00:15:26.773]  I mean, we're talking 2-3 point negative.
[00:15:26.773 --> 00:15:31.376]  That is a roaring depression.
[00:15:31.376 --> 00:15:34.038]  But see, they selectively picked the winners now in the economy.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:43.074]  If you're the right family, the right group, the right globalist organization, the right political vent.
[00:15:43.074 --> 00:15:43.875]  Fragile U.S.
[00:15:43.875 --> 00:15:47.482]  economy, this is Bloomberg, now facing a slowdown in building boom.
[00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:55.831]  And that was only a fake building boom because they gave the elite banks free money by the trillions, nobody else.
[00:15:55.831 --> 00:16:01.993]  That's why you saw buildings being built everywhere for you, the new renter class, that it's never going to own.
[00:16:01.993 --> 00:16:09.194]  And you're going to pay, on average in Austin, $3,000 a month for a 250-square-foot apartment.
[00:16:09.194 --> 00:16:13.735]  Just a few years ago, you'd pay that in a nice area of town for a 2,000-square-foot.
[00:16:13.735 --> 00:16:14.855]  Not anymore!
[00:16:14.855 --> 00:16:17.916]  It's trendy where you pay more for less.
[00:16:19.462 --> 00:16:25.847]  To the guys that fly jumbo jets and have jet copters and 50 mistresses.
[00:16:25.847 --> 00:16:30.990]  But they told you it was cute to be poor.
[00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:35.774]  Oil giant Exxon profits crash 59% 17-year low.
[00:16:35.774 --> 00:16:40.717]  Texas shale oil has fought Saudi Arabia to a standstill on a telegraph.
[00:16:40.717 --> 00:16:43.199]  Italy's oldest bank gets 5 billion euro rescue.
[00:16:47.056 --> 00:16:48.837]  But boy, it's a great economy.
[00:16:48.837 --> 00:16:51.879]  Look at this little juicy up on InfoWars.com.
[00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:55.721]  We saw this a couple times in Germany lately, but now it's in London.
[00:16:55.721 --> 00:16:58.543]  Authorities cover up London car bomb attack.
[00:16:58.543 --> 00:17:00.184]  But the police admitted that was a real bomb.
[00:17:00.184 --> 00:17:05.568]  They were able to defuse it, but... Oh, I love this new thing from the left, the controlled left.
[00:17:06.388 --> 00:17:11.572]  They're running around now calling themselves conspiracy theorists, writing articles that Jones is sold out.
[00:17:11.572 --> 00:17:15.554]  Jones always said Muslim attacks were false flags and fake.
[00:17:15.554 --> 00:17:17.716]  And now he says they're all real.
[00:17:17.716 --> 00:17:19.977]  Jones, Jones is a right winger.
[00:17:19.977 --> 00:17:20.878]  Jones is blah, blah, blah.
[00:17:20.878 --> 00:17:21.738]  No, what I am is a patriot.
[00:17:21.738 --> 00:17:22.639]  I tell the truth.
[00:17:22.639 --> 00:17:34.467]  When the FBI gets caught getting a mentally ill person and trying to get him to blow up a Christmas tree in Portland, Oregon, the Christmas tree lining, and it turns out that he had no jihadi connections and they went and found a mentally ill person and got him to try to go do it.
[00:17:34.467 --> 00:17:35.828]  That is an attempt to get funding.
[00:17:36.608 --> 00:17:38.950]  And that's a false flag and we talk about it ad nauseum.
[00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.070]  And there's a bunch of those.
[00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:48.575]  A new phase has begun where the false flag is the globalists are letting in 5 million in Europe and who knows how many here.
[00:17:48.575 --> 00:17:53.158]  Real jihadis, 80% military age men and they're attacking and they're killing.
[00:17:53.158 --> 00:17:58.921]  And then they take our rights and start Islamic training in schools to make us conform with them to go along with it.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.061]  That's the next phase.
[00:18:02.061 --> 00:18:02.901]  That's what's going on.
[00:18:02.901 --> 00:18:10.524]  So see, the strategies change, the globalist operations change, and I get up here and I explain what's going on.
[00:18:10.524 --> 00:18:16.946]  And world leaders listen, and all the major intelligence agencies listen, and the Pentagon listens, and everybody else listens.
[00:18:16.946 --> 00:18:20.407]  I'm not bragging, it's a fact, because I know what I'm talking about.
[00:18:20.407 --> 00:18:25.889]  Because I come from a smart family, with good genetics, that are smart, and have always been involved in stuff like this.
[00:18:25.889 --> 00:18:28.270]  Now you go suck your thumbs and talk to mommy.
[00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:36.431]  Now, continuing, there's a real program to flood the West with jihadists.
[00:18:36.431 --> 00:18:37.971]  They're flooding Russia with them.
[00:18:37.971 --> 00:18:39.112]  They're attacking.
[00:18:39.112 --> 00:18:42.053]  It's real.
[00:18:42.053 --> 00:18:48.655]  It's real when 200 plus thousand Christians get killed by jihadist forces brought in to Syria by Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[00:18:48.655 --> 00:18:50.495]  It's in the stinking emails.
[00:18:50.495 --> 00:18:51.756]  We told you it was coming beforehand.
[00:18:52.995 --> 00:18:59.778]  We were against killing the 100 plus thousand moderate Muslims, and that's what they were, in Libya.
[00:18:59.778 --> 00:19:05.661]  We were against the Iraq War, because those were moderate Muslims being taken down by Saudi Arabia and the globalists.
[00:19:05.661 --> 00:19:16.646]  The globalists are running the Wahhabist Jihad death cult, and it's taking over all of Islam, and they're murdering 10 to 1 Muslims that they kill, Westerners or Christians, and I'm against that.
[00:19:19.653 --> 00:19:24.376]  There are a lot of Muslims that don't want to be in the most radical, extreme version of it.
[00:19:24.376 --> 00:19:25.537]  But I want to explain something.
[00:19:25.537 --> 00:19:33.241]  The radical, extreme version of Wahhabism is taking over the dominant form of Islam, the Sunnis.
[00:19:33.241 --> 00:19:34.422]  It's a fact.
[00:19:34.422 --> 00:19:37.304]  So learn the names of the groups, learn the history.
[00:19:37.304 --> 00:19:39.045]  Do you know the history of Saudi Arabia?
[00:19:39.045 --> 00:19:42.127]  So-called leftists out there that says, ISIS?
[00:19:42.127 --> 00:19:46.909]  That's the group that has nothing to do with Islam!
[00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:47.550]  You're an idiot.
[00:19:48.763 --> 00:19:55.284]  All right, we're going to come back, get into the exclusive NSA architect agency as all of Clinton's lead emails.
[00:19:55.284 --> 00:19:59.425]  And then we've got huge election news, huge Olympics news, and more.

[00:23:29.502 --> 00:23:33.543]  We've all been taught that when you die, and if you're good, you go to heaven.
[00:23:33.543 --> 00:23:39.865]  What if you found out that when you die, you don't go to heaven, but you sleep in the grave and await a resurrection?
[00:23:39.865 --> 00:23:41.585]  We built a website for the curious.
[00:23:41.585 --> 00:23:44.226]  It's called thebiblesaysthat.org.
[00:23:44.226 --> 00:23:47.107]  What you've been taught might not actually be in the Bible.
[00:23:47.107 --> 00:23:54.629]  Thebiblesaysthat.org dismantles misguided religious doctrines and helps you find your own way, your own answers, straight from the Bible.

[00:24:22.608 --> 00:24:23.548]  All right, here's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:23.548 --> 00:24:29.610]  I'm going to tell you some of the other news that's coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:41.615]  And then I'm also going to tell you about a project we're launching here that is just to shed light on the fact that Hillary stole the nomination and that our electoral process is in serious trouble.
[00:24:41.615 --> 00:24:42.755]  And for the first time in history,
[00:24:46.195 --> 00:24:52.859]  We have a nominee who lost in the primary, but was installed by superdelegates.
[00:24:52.859 --> 00:24:56.861]  They created in 1972, but never implemented.
[00:24:56.861 --> 00:25:09.488]  And so if this precedent gets set, we're going to see a new imperium set up, just like in the old Soviet Union or in Communist China today, where we have a central committee and then a Politburo that elects the presidents.
[00:25:09.488 --> 00:25:12.030]  I mean, that's what this is.
[00:25:13.103 --> 00:25:15.084]  And so I shot a video Saturday.
[00:25:15.084 --> 00:25:16.946]  It's called An Emergency Message to Donald Trump.
[00:25:16.946 --> 00:25:21.048]  I'm going to repost it at the front page of Infowars.com.
[00:25:21.048 --> 00:25:23.510]  In the next hour, Paul Watson is doing an article about it.
[00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:30.815]  And then we're going to do big, detailed investigative reports documenting all the different ways they're cheating, the way they're stealing, the way they're manipulating.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.302]  How Google's not listing Trump as a presidential candidate.
[00:25:35.302 --> 00:25:36.964]  How Twitter's blocking it.
[00:25:36.964 --> 00:25:37.985]  How they're rigging the debates.
[00:25:37.985 --> 00:25:39.367]  How they're rigging polls.
[00:25:39.367 --> 00:25:44.553]  So people can just say, hey, do you really want to be part of a rigged election and make yourself feel like you're with a winner, Hillary Clinton?
[00:25:46.857 --> 00:25:53.378]  Because I'm reading about record numbers now saying they're going to vote for Green Party or Libertarian because they don't want Trump or Hillary.
[00:25:53.378 --> 00:25:55.039]  You have to go for Trump.
[00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:56.639]  He bucked the whole system.
[00:25:56.639 --> 00:25:58.039]  They tried to steal the nomination.
[00:25:58.039 --> 00:25:59.180]  He fought for it.
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.800]  He wants to bring jobs back.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.601]  The whole establishment's against him.
[00:26:02.601 --> 00:26:07.122]  If you're sick of the establishment, you must go for Donald Trump.
[00:26:07.122 --> 00:26:11.623]  I mean, they're getting rid of the electoral process.
[00:26:11.623 --> 00:26:13.323]  You have to go for the guy.
[00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:15.801]  That is bucking that.
[00:26:15.801 --> 00:26:19.082]  It's a no-brainer.
[00:26:19.082 --> 00:26:21.782]  They've gotten rid of our families.
[00:26:21.782 --> 00:26:22.983]  They've gotten rid of our churches.
[00:26:22.983 --> 00:26:32.045]  Now our communities are just groups of basically adult children running around trying to conform to whatever the new cultural guidelines are to be trendy.
[00:26:32.045 --> 00:26:33.225]  They're scared.
[00:26:33.225 --> 00:26:34.425]  They're poor.
[00:26:34.425 --> 00:26:36.265]  They're desperate.
[00:26:36.265 --> 00:26:39.246]  And the system's telling them it's cool to be poor.
[00:26:39.246 --> 00:26:42.647]  It's cool to be ignorant.
[00:26:42.647 --> 00:26:43.127]  I have been on
[00:26:44.298 --> 00:26:51.101]  Facebook just randomly searching random profiles just to see what's going on out there with trendies.
[00:26:51.101 --> 00:26:57.003]  And many of them will have links to InfoWars going, look at this racist kook.
[00:26:57.003 --> 00:27:00.645]  I've got a screenshot of it on my phone.
[00:27:00.645 --> 00:27:04.926]  He says Pockemon is a government conspiracy.
[00:27:04.926 --> 00:27:10.649]  Pockemon, or I know I pronounced it wrong on purpose, Pocket Monster, Pokemon,
[00:27:11.892 --> 00:27:17.676]  Was set up with a grant, directed to Western intelligence agencies.
[00:27:17.676 --> 00:27:29.703]  Google Earth, live time, tracks everywhere you are, sending a video back to Google, who had trucks all over the country and the world, breaking into people's passcodes, getting into their computers and downloading their databases.
[00:27:31.653 --> 00:27:36.256]  Now they have driverless cars with these masked and video cameras and code breakers.
[00:27:36.256 --> 00:27:38.277]  Literal imperial probe droids.
[00:27:38.277 --> 00:27:45.122]  Robot cars driving around, jacking and stealing everything off your computer and they don't get in trouble because they're an arm of the government.
[00:27:48.988 --> 00:27:53.011]  Major tech companies admit they're watching and listening to you at your house.
[00:27:53.011 --> 00:28:00.336]  We told people that 15 years ago, with the patents, with the press releases, from Google, to their shareholders, and people didn't believe it.
[00:28:00.336 --> 00:28:06.281]  Now it's like, okay, yeah, my TV's watching me, big deal.
[00:28:06.281 --> 00:28:11.785]  You go get a new smart TV, and when you fire it up, it says, read the contract, or click here.
[00:28:11.785 --> 00:28:14.787]  You go read, there's 20, 30, 40 pages of contract, depending on the TV.
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.641]  Like I just bought one a few months ago and went and looked at it.
[00:28:18.641 --> 00:28:19.661]  I'm gonna do a whole report on it.
[00:28:19.661 --> 00:28:26.144]  And it says right there, we will share audio and video of what's going on in your house with third parties.
[00:28:26.144 --> 00:28:28.185]  So watch what you do.
[00:28:28.185 --> 00:28:29.745]  Oh my gosh!
[00:28:29.745 --> 00:28:31.306]  I mean, whoa!
[00:28:31.306 --> 00:28:38.508]  We played the video tutorial here on air where Samsung says, watch what you do.
[00:28:38.508 --> 00:28:39.309]  It doesn't matter.
[00:28:40.481 --> 00:28:51.569]  I'm on these Facebooks, these people have history degrees, art degrees, jobs, and they're making jokes about us, warning them, and we were the first!
[00:28:51.569 --> 00:28:57.493]  Meanwhile, CNN comes out and says your TV may be watching you decades after I told you.
[00:28:57.493 --> 00:29:01.756]  And that's what I'm getting at here is, this isn't about liberal or conservative.
[00:29:03.968 --> 00:29:08.233]  This is about autism going from 1 in 30-something thousand 35 years ago to 1 in 58.
[00:29:08.233 --> 00:29:13.178]  There's only one country that takes more vaccines than the United States, and that's South Korea.
[00:29:13.178 --> 00:29:15.901]  They're 1 in 24.
[00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:22.548]  They got warehouses in every neighborhood of kids that are 10, 15 years old wearing diapers.
[00:29:24.995 --> 00:29:26.657]  Throwing crap on the walls.
[00:29:26.657 --> 00:29:27.718]  They're gone.
[00:29:27.718 --> 00:29:29.760]  They got hit and hit hard.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:34.485]  And it's a soft kill program where we just kill our kids' brains right in front of everybody and nobody cares.
[00:29:34.485 --> 00:29:38.068]  We just accept that soon it'll be one in three by 2025.
[00:29:38.068 --> 00:29:42.053]  That's even the Ministry of Health.
[00:29:42.053 --> 00:29:43.474]  The Health Service in England.
[00:29:43.474 --> 00:29:45.256]  I mean, whoa!
[00:29:45.256 --> 00:29:45.796]  Doesn't matter.
[00:29:45.796 --> 00:29:47.338]  Trendies just make jokes.
[00:29:47.338 --> 00:29:48.099]  It's all funny.
[00:29:49.372 --> 00:29:53.293]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.293 --> 00:30:00.236]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.236 --> 00:30:03.017]  And what's likely another attempt to downplay Islamic terrorism.
[00:30:03.017 --> 00:30:05.998]  London authorities covered up an attempted car bombing on Saturday night.
[00:30:05.998 --> 00:30:16.461]  According to a source who reached out to InfoWars, Camden Lock, a popular area for club goers, was evacuated by police after a report about a suspicious vehicle at 10.50pm local time, as reported by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:30:16.601 --> 00:30:24.086]  Metropolitan Police sent in a bomb robot to check the car and sequentially announced that the vehicle was not deemed too suspicious and officers were stood down.
[00:30:24.086 --> 00:30:31.510]  However, according to an employee who works at one of the venues that was evacuated, he saw information that suggests the incident was in fact an attempted terrorist attack.
[00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:37.314]  The bomb was real, he said, adding that the device contained shrapnel and that the car was filled with gas canisters.
[00:30:37.314 --> 00:30:40.556]  Additionally, the vehicle had no registered owner and no insurance.
[00:30:40.876 --> 00:30:48.665]  The employee also said, quote, the car was parked in a very high traffic area with busy clubs and pubs all around including a sold-out open-air event.
[00:30:48.665 --> 00:30:51.008]  If it went off, a lot of people wouldn't have made it home that night.
[00:30:51.008 --> 00:30:53.471]  The mainstream media won't report on it, so maybe you will.
[00:30:53.471 --> 00:30:58.496]  And for more news the mainstream media won't cover out of fear of political correctness, visit InfoWars.com.
[00:30:58.496 --> 00:30:59.658]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:30:59.938 --> 00:31:06.443]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[00:31:06.443 --> 00:31:19.232]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[00:31:19.432 --> 00:31:23.094]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[00:31:23.094 --> 00:31:30.077]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[00:31:30.077 --> 00:31:42.884]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[00:31:42.944 --> 00:31:44.786]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[00:31:44.786 --> 00:31:51.191]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:58.110]  Check it out for yourself today.
[00:33:07.031 --> 00:33:13.634]  There's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:13.634 --> 00:33:16.435]  You even wanna have Alex Jones Show?
[00:33:16.435 --> 00:33:22.758]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:33:22.758 --> 00:33:29.501]  I just watched a video of the DNC that I missed where this preacher was bringing everybody in for a one world religion.
[00:33:29.501 --> 00:33:32.803]  And here in my stack I've got the Pope calling for a one world religion.
[00:33:34.136 --> 00:33:40.139]  And for a new man, a new form of human that sees no differences and has open borders.
[00:33:40.139 --> 00:33:47.482]  Of course, they don't tell you who's going to run the world government that sits over the nation states.
[00:33:47.482 --> 00:33:59.068]  Because once it's in place, they will begin testing the bioweapons on the population, as I've told you forever, and use the Olympics as a rollout for it.
[00:33:59.068 --> 00:34:01.969]  This particular one in the aggregate is a PSYOP.
[00:34:03.948 --> 00:34:07.650]  1954, the Rockefeller Foundation patented it and weaponized Zika.
[00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:10.491]  It's since mutated thanks to mosquitoes they've released.
[00:34:10.491 --> 00:34:11.131]  Oh!
[00:34:11.131 --> 00:34:11.892]  An accident!
[00:34:11.892 --> 00:34:13.192]  What could go wrong?
[00:34:13.192 --> 00:34:14.573]  And it's spreading.
[00:34:14.573 --> 00:34:19.214]  And yes, it's sexually transmitted or transmitted by saliva or other bodily fluid.
[00:34:19.214 --> 00:34:21.015]  And there's a Zika emergency.
[00:34:21.015 --> 00:34:23.556]  That's the headline at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:34:23.556 --> 00:34:26.397]  Zika emergency in Florida.
[00:34:26.397 --> 00:34:30.719]  Ten more people likely contracted Zika from mosquitoes.
[00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:32.440]  Governor Rick Scott asked CDC
[00:34:34.124 --> 00:34:36.865]  To activate emergency response teams.
[00:34:36.865 --> 00:34:45.086]  And remember, remember old Bill Gates a few years ago, releasing at a TED Talk, releasing a bunch of mosquitoes, live ones, and laughing at everybody?
[00:34:45.086 --> 00:34:53.088]  He's got a bunch of patents on vaccines delivered by mosquito and other little goodies.
[00:34:53.088 --> 00:34:57.708]  So we're going to be obviously getting into that report.
[00:34:57.708 --> 00:35:00.049]  But before I go any further,
[00:35:01.328 --> 00:35:06.030]  We have ended the big mega sale, the biggest in our history.
[00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:15.255]  Every item basically, the lowest level item, the lowest level sale 20% off, the highest 40% off on hundreds of items.
[00:35:15.255 --> 00:35:18.777]  Now, we have kept three items though, this week.
[00:35:18.777 --> 00:35:24.280]  That's Rainforce, Wall Supplies Last, the amazing Nootropic for $17.76, normally $29.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.601]  Leading competitors that have similar formulas are $60 to $70 to $80.
[00:35:28.499 --> 00:35:29.840]  So we're already a great deal at that price.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.964]  It has some ingredients that are controlled or prescription in Europe.
[00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:34.485]  That's how powerful it is.
[00:35:34.485 --> 00:35:37.788]  Read about it for yourself at Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:37.788 --> 00:35:38.749]  That's 40% off.
[00:35:38.749 --> 00:35:40.751]  DNA Force, our flagship product.
[00:35:40.751 --> 00:35:43.955]  It's a big deal to offer 30% off on that.
[00:35:43.955 --> 00:35:44.896]  We're extending that.
[00:35:44.896 --> 00:35:46.797]  And then Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:35:46.797 --> 00:35:50.882]  All the vitamins, all the minerals, the amino acids, the cofactors to help upload it.
[00:35:50.882 --> 00:35:52.043]  Great tasting fruit punch.
[00:35:53.956 --> 00:35:55.339]  Organically flavored.
[00:35:55.339 --> 00:35:57.164]  There's nothing else out there like it.
[00:35:57.164 --> 00:35:58.086]  It's amazing.
[00:35:58.086 --> 00:35:59.249]  It's plant-derived minerals.
[00:36:00.586 --> 00:36:03.729]  Infowars, Life.com, that's 30% off.
[00:36:03.729 --> 00:36:05.130]  But I'm going to go further.
[00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:05.490]  Boom!
[00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:05.990]  Here it is.
[00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:08.512]  Normally you sign up for auto shipping, you get 10% off.
[00:36:08.512 --> 00:36:10.634]  You still get that on top of it.
[00:36:10.634 --> 00:36:12.996]  50% on orders of $50 or more.
[00:36:12.996 --> 00:36:14.457]  I'm doing free shipping on everything.
[00:36:14.457 --> 00:36:23.745]  Whether it's one Hillary for prison shirt, or a Bill Clinton rape shirt, or whatever it is, whatever informational warfare weapon you want to help spread the word and meet like-minded people.
[00:36:26.431 --> 00:36:29.633]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is free shipping storewide.
[00:36:29.633 --> 00:36:31.434]  Free shipping storewide.
[00:36:31.434 --> 00:36:35.176]  Free shipping storewide.
[00:36:35.176 --> 00:36:41.821]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, you can get 40% off on RainForce.
[00:36:41.821 --> 00:36:45.703]  You can get 30% off on DNAForce.
[00:36:45.703 --> 00:36:47.484]  I'm not going to sit here and belabor this.
[00:36:47.484 --> 00:36:48.545]  You need to go read
[00:36:56.584 --> 00:37:23.137]  People should really go read and see the hundreds of studies that are there, breaking down just what BioPQQ does, and why this is such an amazing nutraceutical, and why it's so important that folks take it daily, because the compounds in this are just amazing.
[00:37:23.137 --> 00:37:24.418]  I mean, you just know they're from God.
[00:37:25.677 --> 00:37:26.858]  But I'm not gonna get into the science.
[00:37:26.858 --> 00:37:30.281]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:37.187]  Go there to the page for yourself, and you can check it all out at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:37.187 --> 00:37:46.415]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site, and your purchases make it possible, everything we do here.
[00:37:46.415 --> 00:37:51.319]  So I wanna thank you all for your support, your prayers, and so much more.
[00:37:51.319 --> 00:37:53.861]  Now, before I go any further,
[00:37:58.348 --> 00:38:01.089]  I want to go ahead and play this clip.
[00:38:01.089 --> 00:38:01.950]  I played it yesterday.
[00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:04.050]  The video's up on Infowars.com.
[00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:06.031]  But for me, this is central.
[00:38:06.031 --> 00:38:14.595]  The video is titled... I've been getting a buzz in my hair.
[00:38:14.595 --> 00:38:16.075]  It's all right.
[00:38:16.075 --> 00:38:23.379]  The video is titled, Donald Trump, an emergency message to Donald Trump.
[00:38:23.379 --> 00:38:26.680]  And we're going to play it here in just a moment.
[00:38:28.257 --> 00:38:40.180]  Because it deals with the fact that the globalists are openly trying to steal the election.
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:48.983]  The fact that the globalists have already been rigging things and that Hillary is completely discredited and completely dishonored by the fact that she stole the election from Bernie Sanders.
[00:38:48.983 --> 00:38:50.383]  And I'm not going to drop this.
[00:38:50.383 --> 00:38:52.384]  And the American people aren't going to drop this.
[00:38:52.384 --> 00:38:56.205]  And I can tell you the Trump folks understand how important this is and they're not going to drop it.
[00:38:56.205 --> 00:38:57.305]  So we need a referendum.
[00:38:59.358 --> 00:39:09.628]  A giant landslide against the globalists to repudiate what they've done.
[00:39:09.628 --> 00:39:11.569]  It's just that simple.
[00:39:11.569 --> 00:39:15.093]  And it's something that, if we don't do it,
[00:39:16.434 --> 00:39:24.617]  It absolutely sets the precedent where they can do whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want, and things just get worse and worse.
[00:39:24.617 --> 00:39:27.858]  They're already talking about arresting people for their peaceful speech.
[00:39:27.858 --> 00:39:31.639]  They're already talking about national forced labor, like Venezuela's brought in.
[00:39:31.639 --> 00:39:37.901]  They're already talking about national compulsory service, not just in the military, but in social justice warrior garbage.
[00:39:37.901 --> 00:39:45.724]  This is all the telltale signs, all the red flags, all the evidence, the signature of hardcore tyranny.
[00:39:47.432 --> 00:39:52.878]  And then I'm going to get into the Pope calling for a one-world religion and a lot more.
[00:39:52.878 --> 00:39:55.540]  But here is the video report that's up on Infowars.com.
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.723]  I'm going to have it reposted and...
[00:40:00.396 --> 00:40:10.843]  Send out to everybody because it is so key as the grassroots to force this issue out there in the open and to reach out to the Bernie Sanders people and say, are you total chumps?
[00:40:10.843 --> 00:40:11.644]  He betrayed you.
[00:40:11.644 --> 00:40:12.564]  He scammed you.
[00:40:12.564 --> 00:40:13.965]  He let her rob you.
[00:40:13.965 --> 00:40:17.307]  They tried to rob Trump like this, but he stood up against it.
[00:40:17.307 --> 00:40:18.748]  That's why they're against him.
[00:40:18.748 --> 00:40:22.651]  He agrees with Sanders on trade and on the big banks and so many issues.
[00:40:22.651 --> 00:40:23.712]  What is your problem?
[00:40:23.712 --> 00:40:27.634]  She is the corrupt element of Wall Street candidate.
[00:40:27.634 --> 00:40:30.156]  She is the Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan minion.
[00:40:30.957 --> 00:40:33.158]  She is the plague.
[00:40:33.158 --> 00:40:38.943]  There's another interview I did on this with Roger Stone yesterday titled, Roger Stone, Hillary plans to seal election.
[00:40:38.943 --> 00:40:40.424]  We break it down there as well.
[00:40:40.424 --> 00:40:43.327]  This is so important if you want to beat her.
[00:40:43.327 --> 00:40:49.432]  Not just to stop election fraud that day, but to turn everyone against her by pointing out what a crook she is.
[00:40:50.694 --> 00:40:55.737]  This is just one more corruption, but she can try to twist the email stuff or twist all the other garbage.
[00:40:55.737 --> 00:40:57.258]  She can't do this.
[00:40:57.258 --> 00:41:01.300]  Bernie Sanders won, and they had the superdelegates ignore it.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:04.422]  So let's go ahead and go to this special report, an emergency message to Donald Trump.
[00:41:04.422 --> 00:41:05.722]  Please spread it to everyone you know.
[00:41:05.722 --> 00:41:11.326]  Alex Jones here with an extremely important message to Donald Trump, the people of the United States, the people of the world.
[00:41:11.326 --> 00:41:15.288]  Crooked Hillary Clinton has openly stolen the nomination of Bernie Sanders.
[00:41:15.288 --> 00:41:18.310]  Mr. Trump, I'm not going to lay things out here that you don't already know.
[00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:32.126]  But I am going to ask you to seriously think about making the issue of Hillary's election fraud in the primaries one of the central issues to defeating her in November.
[00:41:33.186 --> 00:41:42.331]  I have interviewed all the top election fraud experts, whether it's from low-level retail voter fraud or election fraud with the black box voting machines.
[00:41:42.331 --> 00:41:44.092]  And the evidence is clear.
[00:41:44.092 --> 00:41:48.815]  Only landslides can defeat major election fraud.
[00:41:48.815 --> 00:41:58.901]  And as your polls go up and up and up, 7-10 points against Hillary, as people learn how corrupt she is and how corrupt she has been, your numbers are only going to go up.
[00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:02.851]  They know you are the real leader.
[00:42:02.851 --> 00:42:06.312]  They know you should be the next president of the United States.
[00:42:06.312 --> 00:42:07.812]  And they're going to try to block you.
[00:42:07.812 --> 00:42:18.295]  When the mainstream media ridiculed Donald Trump and said he was a sore loser, that he shouldn't talk about Ted Cruz canceling elections and having voterless victories in the primaries.
[00:42:18.295 --> 00:42:24.117]  Yes, it was sensational when he came out and said, I'm winning these states, but they're giving the delegates to Ted Cruz.
[00:42:24.117 --> 00:42:29.238]  In some cases, they would just cancel elections in many states and just give him all the delegates.
[00:42:30.296 --> 00:42:31.958]  So we have a rigged system.
[00:42:31.958 --> 00:42:34.580]  So in Colorado, they were going to vote.
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.181]  And you saw what's happening in Colorado.
[00:42:36.181 --> 00:42:38.123]  It's one of the big things.
[00:42:38.123 --> 00:42:40.325]  It's a fix.
[00:42:40.325 --> 00:42:43.428]  Because we thought we were having an election.
[00:42:43.428 --> 00:42:46.471]  And a number of months ago, they decided to do it by
[00:42:47.779 --> 00:42:48.539]  You know what?
[00:42:48.539 --> 00:42:49.499]  Right?
[00:42:49.499 --> 00:42:51.200]  Right?
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.601]  They said we'll do it by delegate.
[00:42:53.601 --> 00:42:55.861]  They said they're going to do it by delegate.
[00:42:55.861 --> 00:42:57.161]  Oh, isn't that nice?
[00:42:57.161 --> 00:43:00.442]  And the delegates were all there, all waiting.
[00:43:00.442 --> 00:43:06.564]  And the head guy, in fact, one of them tweeted out today or said today by mistake, and then they withdrew it.
[00:43:06.564 --> 00:43:07.984]  Something to the effect.
[00:43:07.984 --> 00:43:09.345]  See, never Trump.
[00:43:09.345 --> 00:43:10.165]  Look what we did.
[00:43:10.165 --> 00:43:10.685]  Never Trump.
[00:43:10.685 --> 00:43:14.626]  Because if I go to the voters of Colorado, we win Colorado.
[00:43:15.006 --> 00:43:16.567]  Donald Trump wasn't intimidated.
[00:43:16.567 --> 00:43:18.228]  He came out and said, what do you mean?
[00:43:18.228 --> 00:43:21.710]  When I win a state, I should win the delegates.
[00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:22.851]  And they had to back down.
[00:43:22.851 --> 00:43:24.472]  Sanders didn't do that.
[00:43:24.472 --> 00:43:26.593]  And Hillary stole it from him.
[00:43:26.593 --> 00:43:36.580]  But Bernie Sanders, I will say this, for the last five weeks, you turn on your television, Sanders wins.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.181]  Sanders wins.
[00:43:38.181 --> 00:43:40.122]  Again, Sanders wins.
[00:43:40.122 --> 00:43:42.964]  Like seven or eight or nine, he keeps winning.
[00:43:43.624 --> 00:43:48.805]  And then you listen to the people and the pundits, and they say he has no chance of winning.
[00:43:48.805 --> 00:43:50.086]  I said, what's going on?
[00:43:50.086 --> 00:43:51.506]  Because you have superdelegates.
[00:43:51.506 --> 00:43:57.547]  By the way, I think the Republicans have a worse system than the Democrats, but they have superdelegates.
[00:43:57.547 --> 00:44:00.808]  It makes it impossible for a guy that wins to win.
[00:44:00.808 --> 00:44:03.629]  It is imperative that the Trump campaign
[00:44:04.449 --> 00:44:13.627]  Make this one of the central issues because it only further documents the organized crime nature of Hillary Rodham Clinton and her crime family.
[00:44:14.904 --> 00:44:19.007]  If she stole the primary, she's going to try to steal the general election.
[00:44:19.007 --> 00:44:21.649]  So Donald Trump's already done the right thing in the primary.
[00:44:21.649 --> 00:44:24.451]  He didn't let the voters have their votes stolen.
[00:44:24.451 --> 00:44:27.333]  He didn't let himself and his family be robbed as well.
[00:44:27.333 --> 00:44:28.994]  He stood up and said no.
[00:44:28.994 --> 00:44:34.137]  And so now, Donald Trump needs to really think about what he's going to do.
[00:44:34.137 --> 00:44:43.664]  But we have to think about what are we going to do to stop Hillary, who's already stolen the process, who's a fraudulent nominee, from stealing the general election.
[00:44:44.548 --> 00:44:47.669]  But my message to the American people is this.
[00:44:47.669 --> 00:44:51.390]  You're having your republic stolen in front of you.
[00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:57.292]  Not in our 240 years has there ever been a primary where they openly stole it from a nominee.
[00:44:57.292 --> 00:44:59.492]  This is unprecedented.
[00:44:59.492 --> 00:45:03.834]  And we need a referendum supporting free and open elections in this country.
[00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:11.596]  And that referendum is a landslide for Mr. Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States.
[00:45:12.236 --> 00:45:15.319]  We've got to call this fraud out for what she is.
[00:45:15.319 --> 00:45:17.922]  I know there's this attitude of good sportsmanship.
[00:45:17.922 --> 00:45:23.928]  When you're on the field with the Al Capone of politics, Hillary Clinton, you've got to tell it like it is.
[00:45:23.928 --> 00:45:26.932]  And Mr. Trump, I know I'm not telling you something you don't know.
[00:45:26.932 --> 00:45:32.297]  The reason you are successful is you have courage, you're a maverick, and you're not pulling punches.
[00:45:33.198 --> 00:45:38.659]  I'm asking the American people to support you in standing up to this witch.
[00:45:38.659 --> 00:45:48.502]  And I'm asking the American people to take action and to really cause a grassroots brushfire dealing with the issue of black box voting, election fraud, illegals voting, and others.
[00:45:48.502 --> 00:45:54.063]  Because if you think Hillary's gonna stop with stealing the nomination, if you think she's gonna try to steal the general election,
[00:45:55.472 --> 00:45:57.713]  I got a bridge in Brooklyn I want to sell you.
[00:45:57.713 --> 00:46:01.195]  Now, this has just been a basic announcement of these messages.
[00:46:01.195 --> 00:46:13.720]  I'm going to be filing these on a weekly basis with detailed reports at InfoWars.com, documenting everything we're breaking down so that not just Mr. Trump, but the general public can get this information out to everyone we know.
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:17.342]  I, as a citizen, am standing up for the integrity of my right to vote.
[00:46:22.994 --> 00:46:38.446]  By the way, I was so upset about all this, and just realizing that other people weren't pointing it out, that I've reached out to the campaign in the last week and a half, I've reached out to others, and they've said, no, we really appreciate that fact, we're actually on that, but thank you for pinpointing it.
[00:46:39.295 --> 00:46:43.778]  Man, Stone talked about that yesterday on the air, obviously.
[00:46:43.778 --> 00:46:49.941]  I'm just letting listeners know that really smart politicos that are patriots agree with me.
[00:46:49.941 --> 00:46:55.985]  And they actually agree and say, now that we've thought about it, we do need to get on this earlier instead of later.
[00:46:55.985 --> 00:46:58.966]  Because it's not about her trying to steal it that day.
[00:46:58.966 --> 00:47:00.847]  She's already stolen the nomination.
[00:47:00.847 --> 00:47:06.611]  This is a discrediting issue, a weapon against Hillary that we will use.
[00:47:06.611 --> 00:47:08.372]  We have to reach out to the Sanders people
[00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:11.591]  Pointing out you were robbed.
[00:47:11.591 --> 00:47:16.995]  Do you want to go with the person that robbed you or throw your vote away and go vote for the Green Party person?
[00:47:16.995 --> 00:47:20.677]  Vote for Donald Trump.
[00:47:20.677 --> 00:47:23.759]  Stop being idiots your whole life.
[00:47:23.759 --> 00:47:28.242]  Stop being cons your whole life.
[00:47:28.242 --> 00:47:32.345]  The whole power structure, the foreign leaders, the globalists, they're all against Trump.
[00:47:32.345 --> 00:47:37.948]  It is a no-brainer.
[00:47:37.948 --> 00:47:38.368]  All right, now.
[00:47:39.394 --> 00:47:48.157]  We're going to play a clip coming up in the next hour from the DNC where they were pushing this One World Religion stuff, but let me set the table here first.
[00:47:48.157 --> 00:47:50.238]  Okay?
[00:47:50.238 --> 00:47:50.738]  Report.
[00:47:50.738 --> 00:47:55.920]  Authorities cover up London car bomb attack.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:56.960]  Top Swedish priests.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:00.201]  Islamists have declared war on Christianity.
[00:48:00.201 --> 00:48:00.722]  Video.
[00:48:00.722 --> 00:48:03.102]  Crooked Hillary again calls Benghazi families liars.
[00:48:03.102 --> 00:48:04.583]  This is all up on Infowars.com.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:08.681]  Poll.
[00:48:08.681 --> 00:48:12.349]  Americans want total revolution against mass immigration.
[00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:15.777]  Especially if you gotta pay for all the new people.
[00:48:15.777 --> 00:48:16.378]  Video.
[00:48:16.378 --> 00:48:18.463]  Bernie supporters in Philly say they're voting for Trump.
[00:48:21.826 --> 00:48:30.448]  Trump lambasted over Khan while Clinton gets free pass after lying to Congress and getting money from the Russian government to transfer uranium and weapons systems.
[00:48:30.448 --> 00:48:35.729]  She's the real spy, but she sells out to everybody to destabilize the world.
[00:48:35.729 --> 00:48:37.390]  Just like Spectre plays both sides.
[00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:40.611]  Just like the real Spectre, the Quantum Group.
[00:48:40.611 --> 00:48:44.131]  George Soros plays both sides.
[00:48:44.131 --> 00:48:46.452]  But here's the news that ties into the One World Religion.
[00:48:46.452 --> 00:48:49.113]  This all goes together.
[00:48:49.113 --> 00:48:50.613]  The Pope has come out and said
[00:48:54.884 --> 00:49:01.828]  That Islam has no violence in it and never has, and if you say it does, you're evil.
[00:49:01.828 --> 00:49:03.869]  That is totally, absolutely ridiculous.
[00:49:03.869 --> 00:49:08.152]  Much of Europe fell to Islam in massive invasions.
[00:49:08.152 --> 00:49:15.216]  Fearing reprisal from Muslims, French publisher reverses decision to publish book critical of Islam.
[00:49:15.216 --> 00:49:16.637]  This is how the intimidation begins.
[00:49:18.191 --> 00:49:22.234]  Belgian priest stabbed in his home after refusing to give cash to an asylum seeker.
[00:49:22.234 --> 00:49:29.140]  See, they come and say, I'm allowed to kill you because you're a demi, or a kaffir, a subhuman, but just give me money and I won't.
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.882]  Well, he didn't, so he's dead.
[00:49:30.882 --> 00:49:35.426]  Pope Francis defends Muslims and blasts, quote, Islam, not terrorism.
[00:49:35.426 --> 00:49:41.571]  Pope Francis yesterday is wrong to identify Islam with terrorism, and it just goes on.
[00:49:41.571 --> 00:49:46.515]  Social injustice, and then it spins it that he's identifying it when he says he's not.
[00:49:51.641 --> 00:50:00.006]  Speaking abroad, the plane talking him back to Rome after a five-day trip to Poland, he said, I think it's not right to identify Islam with terrorism.
[00:50:00.006 --> 00:50:02.587]  It's not right, and it's not true.
[00:50:02.587 --> 00:50:12.012]  Francis was responding to a question about the killing of July 26, 85-year-old Roman Catholic priest by knife-wielding attackers who burst into a church.
[00:50:12.012 --> 00:50:16.215]  And he just said, hey, it's not right to say those were Islamists, even though they pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:16.215 --> 00:50:17.835]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.363]  Young on Poland trip, believe in a new humanity.
[00:50:24.363 --> 00:50:25.585]  This is Associated Press.
[00:50:25.585 --> 00:50:33.634]  So, Pope Francis defends Muslims and blasts Islam is not terrorism.
[00:50:33.634 --> 00:50:37.938]  And you read that headline, it sounds like he's saying it's wrong to say it's not terrorism.
[00:50:37.938 --> 00:50:40.081]  I know he's actually saying it isn't terrorism and don't say it.
[00:50:41.328 --> 00:50:43.109]  It's not right, it's not true, is his quote.
[00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:48.933]  Francis was responding to a question about the killing on, again, July 26th, of an 85-year-old Roman Catholic priest by knife-wielding attackers.
[00:50:48.933 --> 00:50:49.933]  Yeah, they cut his head off.
[00:50:49.933 --> 00:50:54.296]  Who burst into a church service in Western France.
[00:50:54.296 --> 00:50:55.637]  Yeah, in Normandy.
[00:50:55.637 --> 00:50:57.338]  Forced the priest to his knees and slit his throat.
[00:50:57.338 --> 00:50:59.139]  No, they cut his head off.
[00:50:59.139 --> 00:51:03.922]  Now, you want more from the so-called Pope?
[00:51:03.922 --> 00:51:04.922]  Associated Press.
[00:51:04.922 --> 00:51:09.205]  Pope too young on Poland trip believe in a new humanity.
[00:51:11.223 --> 00:51:24.391]  Pope Francis encouraged hundreds of thousands of young people at a global gathering Sunday to believe in a new humanity, close quote, that is stronger than the evil and refuses to see borders and barriers.
[00:51:24.391 --> 00:51:27.733]  See evil sees borders and barriers, like a front door in your house.
[00:51:27.733 --> 00:51:28.934]  Are you having privacy?
[00:51:28.934 --> 00:51:34.957]  Are you electing your own government?
[00:51:34.957 --> 00:51:40.401]  Think about this.
[00:51:40.401 --> 00:51:41.021]  Think about that.
[00:51:43.646 --> 00:51:44.766]  This is the opposite.
[00:51:44.766 --> 00:51:53.408]  I mean, he came out a few months ago, I read the quote probably 20 times on air, and said, it's horrible to say Europe has Christian roots, it's xenophobic and it makes him nauseous.
[00:51:53.408 --> 00:51:57.369]  You know, read the quotes.
[00:51:57.369 --> 00:51:58.769]  What?
[00:51:58.769 --> 00:52:01.850]  And now he says we cannot see borders or barriers like a cult.
[00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:03.530]  Just don't even see it.
[00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:07.931]  But who runs this new system that doesn't have borders?
[00:52:07.931 --> 00:52:08.731]  The global government.
[00:52:11.633 --> 00:52:13.657]  The EU is already run by the multinationals.
[00:52:13.657 --> 00:52:19.229]  This is a system they want worldwide to loot the populations of the Pope.
[00:52:19.229 --> 00:52:20.932]  The Jesuit Pope.
[00:52:20.932 --> 00:52:21.894]  It's even the Leningradian.
[00:52:22.847 --> 00:52:26.788]  They blackmailed the last Pope and basically took the Catholic Church over.
[00:52:26.788 --> 00:52:37.670]  I mean, you can clearly say what you want about the church before this, or it's different permutations and what it's done, and whether it was always bad or always good, but now the Catholic Church is no more.
[00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:41.491]  It is run by someone who is a false prophet.
[00:52:41.491 --> 00:52:44.171]  Is he the false prophet?
[00:52:44.171 --> 00:52:47.532]  I got ABC News saying soon all children will have microchips, you will accept it.
[00:52:48.496 --> 00:52:50.898]  And you better believe this guy will tell you to take a microchip.
[00:52:50.898 --> 00:52:52.980]  He's calling for a cashless society.
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:57.944]  I mean, I wonder if he's got a little red tail, you know, wrapped up in his shorts.
[00:52:57.944 --> 00:53:03.949]  I mean, if I heard the stuff he says and didn't know who said it, I'd say that's Satan himself.
[00:53:03.949 --> 00:53:12.015]  This guy is an abomination.
[00:53:12.015 --> 00:53:13.096]  And here's another report.
[00:53:13.096 --> 00:53:13.676]  Michael Schneider.
[00:53:13.676 --> 00:53:14.577]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:53:15.956 --> 00:53:21.559]  Twelve times Pope Francis has openly promoted a one world religion or a new world order.
[00:53:21.559 --> 00:53:24.000]  He calls for global government.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:29.083]  You can go read the quotes with links to him.
[00:53:29.083 --> 00:53:31.204]  Global government.
[00:53:31.204 --> 00:53:35.926]  They had pedophiles take over the Catholic Church, corrupt it.
[00:53:35.926 --> 00:53:40.889]  The church then covered it up, made the wrong move, and then it got blackmailed for a total takeover.
[00:53:42.284 --> 00:53:44.947]  He says that we should welcome Sunni clerics into our country.
[00:53:44.947 --> 00:53:46.008]  We should build mosques.
[00:53:46.008 --> 00:53:48.290]  All of this.
[00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:51.473]  And of course it's Sunnis he's allied with.
[00:53:51.473 --> 00:53:53.195]  Because that's who Saudi Arabia runs.
[00:53:53.195 --> 00:53:54.376]  That's the blood drinkers.
[00:53:54.376 --> 00:53:55.557]  That's the heart eaters.
[00:53:55.557 --> 00:54:01.563]  That's the folks that sell little girls into slavery.
[00:54:01.563 --> 00:54:02.283]  Not peace though.
[00:54:02.283 --> 00:54:04.786]  He brings in the invasion to bring down Christendom.
[00:54:06.334 --> 00:54:13.978]  Other Popes, literally at the gates of Vienna and the gates of Rome, they have 200 foot walls in Vatican City because of the Muslim invasions.
[00:54:13.978 --> 00:54:14.578]  It's a fact!
[00:54:14.578 --> 00:54:16.859]  Let's admit it!
[00:54:16.859 --> 00:54:17.659]  It's going on!
[00:54:17.659 --> 00:54:24.502]  Let's admit it!
[00:54:24.502 --> 00:54:30.545]  Unbelievable!
[00:54:30.545 --> 00:54:34.127]  Alright, let's shift gears into other news, but first we do have a clip from the DNC.
[00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:44.444]  With this preacher, this priest, getting up with the Clintons and saying, the God of all peoples!
[00:54:44.444 --> 00:54:47.967]  Yes, there is a place in our heart for God.
[00:54:47.967 --> 00:54:56.413]  And yes, Christ said I have many flocks, and I can tell you there's been people, poor pygmies out in the middle of nowhere that never heard about Christ, that had a loving heart that God loved.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:02.124]  But to sit there and say all religions follow the same God.
[00:55:02.124 --> 00:55:04.786]  No, the Aztecs were cutting people's hearts out and selling them meat.
[00:55:04.786 --> 00:55:05.787]  That's not the same God.
[00:55:05.787 --> 00:55:09.230]  The Nazis worshipped a cult of death.
[00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:11.833]  And weird Tibetan black magic.
[00:55:11.833 --> 00:55:14.175]  That's not the same God.
[00:55:14.175 --> 00:55:20.941]  And when they tell you it's all the same God, it's not.
[00:55:20.941 --> 00:55:21.862]  It's not the same God.
[00:55:26.172 --> 00:55:28.634]  And when you start hearing this, it's the one world government.
[00:55:28.634 --> 00:55:38.423]  Where they're going to bring in incompatible religions and then make us all accept that we can't criticize anything and we're arrested.
[00:55:38.423 --> 00:55:39.824]  That's what Revelation says.
[00:55:39.824 --> 00:55:41.365]  And maybe you don't believe Revelation is real.
[00:55:41.365 --> 00:55:41.926]  Fine.
[00:55:41.926 --> 00:55:50.433]  It's been used as a blueprint of control and is being implemented.
[00:55:50.433 --> 00:55:51.194]  It's happening.
[00:55:51.194 --> 00:55:53.736]  The elite believe they're going to merge with machines and become immortal.
[00:55:55.677 --> 00:55:57.658]  What does the devil offer them in Revelations?
[00:55:57.658 --> 00:55:59.179]  Eternal life.
[00:55:59.179 --> 00:56:02.080]  Through his systems.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:07.963]  Everyone in the world can watch the beast at once as a moving creature in everyone's home.
[00:56:07.963 --> 00:56:09.123]  A hologram.
[00:56:09.123 --> 00:56:10.844]  All of this is coming into place.
[00:56:10.844 --> 00:56:13.705]  All of this is happening.
[00:56:13.705 --> 00:56:16.226]  Was it some type of Missionary at Protectorate?
[00:56:16.226 --> 00:56:17.027]  Pre-planning it?
[00:56:17.027 --> 00:56:18.427]  Getting us ready for a plan?
[00:56:18.427 --> 00:56:19.088]  Okay!
[00:56:19.088 --> 00:56:20.428]  It had to come from somewhere else.
[00:56:20.428 --> 00:56:21.529]  Humans didn't cook this up.
[00:56:24.187 --> 00:56:25.329]  Look at what we face.
[00:56:25.329 --> 00:56:27.692]  It's real.
[00:56:27.692 --> 00:56:28.533]  Let's go to this clip.
[00:56:28.533 --> 00:56:28.814]  Here it is.
[00:56:40.951 --> 00:56:47.456]  We know that you call us to work hard to bring people together.
[00:56:47.456 --> 00:56:56.203]  Lord, we allow your love to overcome our fears as we learn to respect the other.
[00:56:56.203 --> 00:57:03.028]  And to treat the most vulnerable of our society just as we do our friends.
[00:57:03.832 --> 00:57:14.819]  Lord, we ask you to open our minds, to discern the complex issues of our communities, our nation, and our world.
[00:57:14.819 --> 00:57:20.522]  Give us the courage to move onward and upward to become a better nation.
[00:57:21.258 --> 00:57:26.282]  May we, as the founder of Methodism, John Wesley, talk.
[00:57:26.282 --> 00:57:28.044]  Let's stop right there.
[00:57:28.044 --> 00:57:29.065]  Let's stop.
[00:57:29.065 --> 00:57:34.649]  I have been to Methodist churches all my life because my family went to Baptist churches but also some Methodist churches.
[00:57:34.649 --> 00:57:48.181]  The Methodist churches that I have been to in the last decade are literal government-run systems to change agent people week by week and brainwash them and take their Christian love and direct it towards the state as God.
[00:57:49.073 --> 00:57:50.634]  And that is exactly what you're hearing.
[00:57:50.634 --> 00:57:54.917]  This is ecumenicalism, World Council of Churches, National Council of Churches.
[00:57:54.917 --> 00:57:58.599]  It is the Rockefeller takeover of the churches.
[00:57:58.599 --> 00:57:59.500]  And it doesn't matter.
[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:03.803]  People have a spiritual connection, they get you in, and it doesn't matter even if it's family.
[00:58:03.803 --> 00:58:05.544]  They will not listen.
[00:58:05.544 --> 00:58:09.747]  They get a crazy look in their eye, and they're gone.
[00:58:09.747 --> 00:58:14.630]  At Methodist churches across the country, they're now removing the cross because it's seen as offensive.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.201]  It started in San Francisco three years ago.
[00:58:19.201 --> 00:58:22.402]  It's now spreading to Austin, the rest of the country.
[00:58:22.402 --> 00:58:23.283]  This is who they are.
[00:58:23.283 --> 00:58:25.564]  They mean business.
[00:58:25.564 --> 00:58:31.107]  We're going to open the phones up in the next hour and cover a bunch of other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[00:58:31.107 --> 00:58:32.027]  The toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[00:58:32.027 --> 00:58:33.228]  First-time callers are up first.
[00:58:33.228 --> 00:58:33.288]  800-259-9231.
[00:58:33.288 --> 00:58:34.408]  Will they try to steal the election?
[00:58:34.408 --> 00:58:35.829]  Will they try to bring in civil emergency?
[00:58:43.936 --> 00:58:46.120]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:49.969 --> 00:58:52.050]  Brain Force, it's completely different.
[00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:53.270]  Try a bottle of it.
[00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:54.851]  Rob Dew joins us.
[00:58:54.851 --> 00:58:57.972]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[00:58:57.972 --> 00:58:59.052]  Tell us what Brain Force did.
[00:58:59.052 --> 00:59:00.013]  I'd been working all day.
[00:59:00.013 --> 00:59:02.514]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[00:59:02.514 --> 00:59:03.934]  I get in here at 830.
[00:59:03.934 --> 00:59:05.835]  I was kind of run down.
[00:59:05.835 --> 00:59:07.776]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[00:59:07.776 --> 00:59:09.636]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[00:59:09.636 --> 00:59:11.477]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[00:59:11.477 --> 00:59:12.557]  I popped two of them.
[00:59:12.557 --> 00:59:14.818]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[00:59:14.818 --> 00:59:16.819]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[00:59:16.819 --> 00:59:18.280]  It's got four and a half stars.
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:19.260]  People really love it.
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:29.507]  Read about it, find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise, because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[00:59:29.507 --> 00:59:33.550]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:39.694]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[00:59:39.694 --> 00:59:45.598]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:52.503 --> 01:00:04.546]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.546 --> 01:00:20.191]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.228 --> 01:00:28.831]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-25-99231.
[01:00:28.831 --> 01:00:36.896]  You know, I think I want to go back to the different patriot groups in the 50s and 60s that discovered the World Government Plan.
[01:00:36.896 --> 01:00:44.620]  It was actually being taught in colleges to the next generation of managers and technocrats.
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:50.403]  Chiefly among them were the John Birch Society.
[01:00:50.403 --> 01:00:53.005]  They were the evil right-wingers that were against the Vietnam War.
[01:00:56.277 --> 01:01:17.123]  Because they laid out the plan from their own documents for a one world religion, a one world army, a one world court, a one world bank, and then every facet of your life dictated to you by the central cultural destructors.
[01:01:17.123 --> 01:01:20.104]  They call themselves engineers.
[01:01:20.104 --> 01:01:23.465]  And you look at it, man, they have built it.
[01:01:23.465 --> 01:01:24.905]  They're about 15 years behind
[01:01:26.601 --> 01:01:30.062]  But now they are massively accelerating it.
[01:01:30.062 --> 01:01:35.823]  They're just doing it no matter what happens.
[01:01:35.823 --> 01:01:37.704]  And so I keep saying they're about 15 years behind.
[01:01:37.704 --> 01:01:39.604]  That's their own admission.
[01:01:39.604 --> 01:01:46.726]  They've been saying they've been 15 years behind for about 20, 30 years, but now I'd say seven, eight, nine years behind.
[01:01:46.726 --> 01:01:50.546]  They've accelerated so much the last five, six years.
[01:01:50.546 --> 01:01:52.547]  Fundamental transformative change.
[01:01:55.888 --> 01:01:57.049]  And they've set up a cult, man.
[01:01:57.049 --> 01:02:07.196]  You get around Trendy's, you get around Fortune 500 businesses, and it's women all in charge, marching around, letting you know they're in charge.
[01:02:07.196 --> 01:02:08.637]  They get all the management jobs.
[01:02:08.637 --> 01:02:09.857]  They're the professionals.
[01:02:09.857 --> 01:02:14.901]  And you could argue in cultures, yeah, men were generally the hunters or, you know, in the more dangerous jobs, whatever.
[01:02:14.901 --> 01:02:15.761]  Men are in charge.
[01:02:15.761 --> 01:02:17.783]  The point is, it's artificially being overthrown.
[01:02:19.141 --> 01:02:20.902]  They've broken up the family.
[01:02:20.902 --> 01:02:28.544]  They're only bringing women into positions of power to end the family, just like the Romans would bring in house slaves.
[01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:29.544]  Was it Walter Williams?
[01:02:29.544 --> 01:02:30.084]  I forget.
[01:02:30.084 --> 01:02:39.487]  Like 20 years ago, there was an editorial I heard Rush Limbaugh talking about, and I actually had to go to this news stand place called News.
[01:02:39.487 --> 01:02:41.167]  One half of it was news.
[01:02:41.167 --> 01:02:43.308]  The other half of the place was like pornography.
[01:02:43.308 --> 01:02:45.309]  But as a news guy, that's where I'd have to go to
[01:02:48.321 --> 01:02:49.422]  They had hundreds of newspapers.
[01:02:49.422 --> 01:02:52.483]  It was when the internet wasn't really that big in like 95, 96.
[01:02:52.483 --> 01:03:01.907]  So I would go every couple days and just get the Chicago Tribune, you know, all these different newspapers that you couldn't get in Austin.
[01:03:01.907 --> 01:03:04.808]  And I remember going and getting the newspaper I heard Limbaugh talk about.
[01:03:06.027 --> 01:03:08.028]  I was my own producer.
[01:03:08.028 --> 01:03:12.489]  And it was one of the black philosopher lawyer commentators, I forget which one.
[01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:23.012]  And it was a whole article about a manual that had been translated out of Latin, that was over 2,000 years old, by French sugarcane slave plantation owners.
[01:03:23.012 --> 01:03:26.192]  If somebody can find this, send it to me, because I can't find it.
[01:03:26.192 --> 01:03:30.654]  And I saw references to it in other history books before, but he had it.
[01:03:30.654 --> 01:03:35.155]  And he was going over, was it Cal Thomas or Walter Williams?
[01:03:37.614 --> 01:03:44.326]  They were going over how they were explaining, and they translated it into English now.
[01:03:44.326 --> 01:03:49.474]  It was being used by slave owners 200-something years ago in the United States, or then the colonies.
[01:03:50.737 --> 01:04:04.662]  About how you get people off the slave ships, you take whoever the obvious leader is, and you beat them to death, and you tell the women, he was bad, we're gonna kill your children now, your little boys, if you don't keep them under our control.
[01:04:04.662 --> 01:04:08.944]  And so the women immediately became informants and controllers, and then they'd be brought in.
[01:04:08.944 --> 01:04:17.807]  That's why you see it in all the old movies, but in the old original culture, where you got the, you know, black mammy in the house, and you know, she's running the show, and the men are outside under her control.
[01:04:18.809 --> 01:04:24.695]  And why she would even, many times, dole out the discipline.
[01:04:24.695 --> 01:04:32.944]  My dad talks about that because he'd be sent for a month here, a month there, working a machine shop in Houston, or they'd send him, you know, for a month to go pick cotton to see what it was like.
[01:04:32.944 --> 01:04:36.488]  He'd talk about being a little kid, picking cotton a couple summers.
[01:04:36.488 --> 01:04:37.909]  And that's who the foremen were.
[01:04:39.457 --> 01:04:43.040]  Old, big black women over poor whites and blacks in the cotton fields.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:43.960]  I'm just telling you.
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:51.386]  And that all is out of a Roman manual that they had, mainly white slaves, about how they would first... I'm going to explain all this when we come back and then go to your calls.
[01:04:51.386 --> 01:04:53.067]  That's what all this is.
[01:04:53.067 --> 01:04:57.250]  This is classic slavery, is what you're seeing right now.
[01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:58.571]  And women are always put in charge.
[01:05:00.812 --> 01:05:06.636]  Hillary Clinton suggested the grieving families of victims of the Benghazi attack are liars in an appearance on Fox News Sunday.
[01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:16.763]  While the corporate media obsessed over Donald Trump's response to a fallen soldier from a Muslim immigrant family, Clinton's response to Pat Smith over the death of her son in Libya was glossed over, as reported by Steve Watson.
[01:05:16.963 --> 01:05:23.426]  Clinton said quote, I don't hold any ill feeling for someone who in that moment may not fully recall everything that was or wasn't said.
[01:05:23.426 --> 01:05:32.491]  Now that's a bold statement coming from Hillary's mouth considering the FBI revealed she lied numerous times about sending classified information over her unsecured private email server.
[01:05:32.491 --> 01:05:43.336]  Hillary's suggesting once again that families of the Benghazi victims didn't hear her properly when she told them the cause of the attack was an anti-Muslim YouTube video that it was not a coordinated pre-planned terror attack.
[01:05:43.336 --> 01:05:45.657]  But private emails revealed Hillary knows the terrorist attack
[01:05:45.897 --> 01:05:55.042]  And additionally, the whole story about the YouTube video was a State Department fabrication to cover up the Department's role in shipping living weapons to jihadists in Syria via Benghazi.

[01:05:57.563 --> 01:05:58.764]  This is Kent Daniels reporting.
[01:05:59.727 --> 01:06:06.271]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:06:06.271 --> 01:06:09.493]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:06:09.493 --> 01:06:15.077]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:06:15.077 --> 01:06:21.201]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:06:21.201 --> 01:06:24.503]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:06:24.503 --> 01:06:25.944]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:06:26.144 --> 01:06:30.446]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:06:30.446 --> 01:06:33.387]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:06:33.387 --> 01:06:35.048]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:06:35.048 --> 01:06:38.489]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:06:38.489 --> 01:06:41.090]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:06:41.090 --> 01:06:42.151]  It's in powder form.
[01:06:42.151 --> 01:06:45.032]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:06:45.032 --> 01:06:45.752]  I take this.
[01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:47.573]  This is the product that I take.
[01:06:47.573 --> 01:06:49.534]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:06:50.355 --> 01:06:51.156]  We fight the Globals.
[01:06:51.156 --> 01:06:52.298]  We fight the New World Order.

[01:06:59.773 --> 01:07:07.962]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[01:07:07.962 --> 01:07:08.762]  Here's why.
[01:07:08.762 --> 01:07:12.907]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[01:07:12.907 --> 01:07:13.848]  So please listen.
[01:07:13.848 --> 01:07:17.551]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[01:07:17.551 --> 01:07:22.016]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases.
[01:07:22.156 --> 01:07:23.898]  and produce electricity from the sun.
[01:07:23.898 --> 01:07:31.226]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[01:07:31.226 --> 01:07:33.568]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[01:07:33.568 --> 01:07:44.820]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators, and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:46.861]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[01:07:46.861 --> 01:07:48.563]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:07:48.563 --> 01:07:50.284]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:07:50.284 --> 01:07:54.167]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[01:07:54.167 --> 01:07:55.728]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:07:55.728 --> 01:07:57.089]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:08:07.225 --> 01:08:09.347]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:08:09.347 --> 01:08:25.084]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:25.084 --> 01:08:26.986]  That guitar feeds the soul, doesn't it?
[01:08:26.986 --> 01:08:28.648]  Listen to that beauty blasting out.
[01:08:36.405 --> 01:08:40.488]  Oh, there's a wind on down the road for global government.
[01:08:40.488 --> 01:08:43.530]  Worldwide extermination.
[01:08:43.530 --> 01:08:44.871]  The UN officially says 80%.
[01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:47.452]  Prince Philip says 80%.
[01:08:47.452 --> 01:08:49.013]  Ted Turner says 90%.
[01:08:49.013 --> 01:09:01.402]  And I've had the higher-level bioweapons technicians openly say, we're gonna wipe everybody out.
[01:09:01.402 --> 01:09:04.204]  They even make movies with Bruce Willis to throw at your face.
[01:09:05.367 --> 01:09:13.372]  And getting you ready for the sacrifice of humanity on the altar of Satan.
[01:09:13.372 --> 01:09:18.254]  Do you have the strength to admit it's happening?
[01:09:18.254 --> 01:09:27.219]  Or is it too over the top for you to face?
[01:09:27.219 --> 01:09:28.060]  Alright.
[01:09:29.139 --> 01:09:30.139]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[01:09:30.139 --> 01:09:31.840]  I had Joel Skousen joining us.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:43.125]  I was going off into modern third-wave feminism that has always been about, in their own manuals, their own training books, on record, to end the family as we know it.
[01:09:43.125 --> 01:09:44.285]  I mean, that's in the textbooks.
[01:09:44.285 --> 01:09:45.005]  That it's archaic.
[01:09:45.005 --> 01:09:45.526]  Get rid of it.
[01:09:45.526 --> 01:09:46.446]  It's horrible.
[01:09:46.446 --> 01:09:52.769]  And that women are better than men, as if we're not all the same species and haven't been through this whole thing together and love each other.
[01:09:52.769 --> 01:09:58.611]  And they use case point examples to create a tribalism within the family unit itself.
[01:10:00.592 --> 01:10:03.534]  The ultimate divide-and-conquer.
[01:10:03.534 --> 01:10:18.024]  And going back to the Romans, they would say go into Germania, or go into Gaul, or go into Brittany, and they would generally just kill all the adult males, because you know, they're not going to submit.
[01:10:18.024 --> 01:10:22.226]  They're never being at their own farm with their own wife and kids.
[01:10:22.226 --> 01:10:26.469]  They're going to get mad when you're raping their wife, and you're selling your daughters and sons off.
[01:10:26.469 --> 01:10:28.811]  So they'd kill everybody above the age of 10.
[01:10:28.811 --> 01:10:30.172]  All males above the age of 10 would be killed.
[01:10:31.807 --> 01:10:40.691]  And then they would take usually a five or six-year-old boy who they claim had misbehaved and they would torture him to death in front of the women.
[01:10:40.691 --> 01:10:43.492]  A lot of times they take four or five hours to get that job done.
[01:10:43.492 --> 01:10:45.153]  It's in the manuals.
[01:10:45.153 --> 01:10:46.133]  There's different ones out there.
[01:10:46.133 --> 01:10:47.574]  This is in Mainline History.
[01:10:47.574 --> 01:10:49.514]  You can go look it up for yourself.
[01:10:49.514 --> 01:10:53.196]  Then they tell the women with their interpreter.
[01:10:55.538 --> 01:11:04.242]  The Romans always had their sub-cohorts that were made up of local contingents that they'd actually trained back in Rome and brought back.
[01:11:04.242 --> 01:11:13.965]  And they'd tell them, listen, you ever let one of your boys, or girls, or anything wrong or not what we say, we're gonna kill three or four of them.
[01:11:13.965 --> 01:11:16.626]  And what did Mama become instantly at that point?
[01:11:16.626 --> 01:11:18.147]  The ultimate enforcer.
[01:11:20.970 --> 01:11:25.794]  The women are brought in the house, the men are kept out in the barn, not allowed to learn or read.
[01:11:25.794 --> 01:11:29.497]  And within a generation or two, it becomes permanent slave classes.
[01:11:29.497 --> 01:11:35.262]  There were some slaves in Rome, five, six, seven generations.
[01:11:35.262 --> 01:11:40.126]  The women could be scribes and write and do everything, would even be the most trusted people.
[01:11:40.126 --> 01:11:41.948]  They would be called legates for the family.
[01:11:41.948 --> 01:11:46.391]  They would be sent on long missions.
[01:11:46.391 --> 01:11:49.174]  And the men would be out of the barn
[01:11:50.563 --> 01:11:54.186]  And weren't even allowed to know how to basically talk.
[01:11:54.186 --> 01:12:02.832]  That was taken, in Latin, into French, into the Caribbean, and put into place there, and then brought into the United States.
[01:12:02.832 --> 01:12:05.975]  And when you see all this, that's what it is.
[01:12:05.975 --> 01:12:08.097]  Period!
[01:12:08.097 --> 01:12:14.842]  And so when you see LBJ and the Great Leap Forward and the Great Society and all that garbage, that's what that is, is ending families.
[01:12:16.451 --> 01:12:22.996]  And you see within two generations almost complete devastation.
[01:12:22.996 --> 01:12:25.457]  These are sciences of control.
[01:12:25.457 --> 01:12:30.941]  And if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[01:12:30.941 --> 01:12:33.503]  It's pretty amazing, isn't it?
[01:12:33.503 --> 01:12:36.185]  And Pope Francis has called for world government again.
[01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:39.907]  He said Islam is never violent, never bad, bring more in.
[01:12:39.907 --> 01:12:41.828]  And that it's horrible if you criticize Islam.
[01:12:41.828 --> 01:12:43.650]  I read that last hour, played the clips.
[01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:45.391]  He says we should have a new humanity.
[01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:49.793]  Quote, without borders or barriers, who cannot see them.
[01:12:49.793 --> 01:12:53.896]  But that means you're ruled by global government.
[01:12:53.896 --> 01:12:56.938]  It's on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:56.938 --> 01:13:01.141]  Everyone is joining Soron.
[01:13:01.141 --> 01:13:05.565]  To use that as an allegory right now.
[01:13:05.565 --> 01:13:08.007]  Except for Russia.
[01:13:08.007 --> 01:13:08.727]  And Donald Trump.
[01:13:10.123 --> 01:13:24.737]  And Ukip, and Infowars, and Drudge, and others who are insane, and who are informed.
[01:13:24.737 --> 01:13:34.425]  Radical Islam is being allowed in everywhere to take over, as I predicted years ago, it's not hard, so that we have to conform to it, and get rid of our free speech,
[01:13:35.438 --> 01:13:37.921]  Because it's our fault when they attack us or kill us.
[01:13:37.921 --> 01:13:51.835]  And now we've gone beyond 1984 changing the names of attackers from Ali to David and saying they're not Islamic even as they pledge allegiance to ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[01:13:51.835 --> 01:13:55.659]  So it is a false flag.
[01:13:55.659 --> 01:13:57.641]  And then groups out there misrepresent what I'm saying.
[01:14:01.041 --> 01:14:02.702]  And say that I'm not saying it's a false flag.
[01:14:02.702 --> 01:14:04.223]  Our governments are illegitimate.
[01:14:04.223 --> 01:14:05.263]  They open the door.
[01:14:05.263 --> 01:14:06.544]  They're bringing the people in.
[01:14:06.544 --> 01:14:08.906]  They run the whole show.
[01:14:08.906 --> 01:14:11.467]  Hollande and Merkel and all of them.
[01:14:11.467 --> 01:14:15.429]  Merkel has declared permanent civil emergency and put troops on the streets.
[01:14:15.429 --> 01:14:19.932]  They changed the German law since 1945 that they can't use troops to suppress the population.
[01:14:19.932 --> 01:14:28.557]  They've arrested more than 20,000 people the last two years that mildly criticized Islam and given them giant multi-thousand euro fines.
[01:14:32.876 --> 01:14:41.740]  Europe is like the new Soviet Union.
[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:46.663]  Meanwhile, look at this report, and then I'm taking your phone calls.
[01:14:46.663 --> 01:14:50.305]  In fact, I'm going to cover this once Skousen joins us.
[01:14:50.305 --> 01:14:53.126]  Exclusive from Wright Bart up on DredgeReport.com.
[01:14:53.126 --> 01:15:00.530]  NSA architect, I should have asked him this when he was on last week, William Binning, says the NSA has all of Clinton's emails.
[01:15:02.401 --> 01:15:04.402]  Of course they do, and that's the thing in law.
[01:15:04.402 --> 01:15:10.165]  Couldn't you go to the NSA and make them show that you were somewhere else than where they claim when you're under a murder investigation or something?
[01:15:10.165 --> 01:15:13.186]  But not anymore, and the courts will say, well, that's secret, we're not going to let you use it.
[01:15:13.186 --> 01:15:17.569]  If you're going to spy on everybody, why don't you at least let it prove we didn't do what we see?
[01:15:17.569 --> 01:15:21.551]  See, no, it's all for evil intent.
[01:15:21.551 --> 01:15:27.794]  They won't even check the IDs or the passports of the quote, immigrants and the migrants and the
[01:15:30.214 --> 01:15:32.576]  Refugees that are coming in, because they're not refugees.
[01:15:32.576 --> 01:15:35.178]  They're the families and the young fighting men.
[01:15:35.178 --> 01:15:40.202]  80% of them being military age, you know, that's a little telltale sign.
[01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.363]  They got kicked.
[01:15:41.363 --> 01:15:42.584]  They got their butt kicked.
[01:15:42.584 --> 01:15:45.106]  They announced Sunday on The Telegraph.
[01:15:46.435 --> 01:15:48.776]  But it was this article about how mean it is.
[01:15:48.776 --> 01:16:00.160]  Jihadis returning from fighting in Libya and Syria and Chechnya and other areas that were allowed to go by MI6, they're going to have to go to sensitivity training for a one-week class when they get back.
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:03.281]  They should be arrested for fighting with ISIS when they get back.
[01:16:03.281 --> 01:16:09.003]  But see, the media spins it like those poor little babies.
[01:16:09.003 --> 01:16:12.364]  And now in many areas, the majority of the time when you get a
[01:16:13.303 --> 01:16:18.686]  Knock on the door about your kid playing in the backyard in England, or didn't take your vaccine, or you said something political.
[01:16:18.686 --> 01:16:22.028]  It's an Islamicist who can barely speak English.
[01:16:22.028 --> 01:16:33.774]  And they know they're in charge, and they know a deal's been made, and they come from countries where it's all about political subterfuge, and it's all about who you backstab, and it's all about working with the state, and it's all about being cutthroat.
[01:16:33.774 --> 01:16:36.736]  As our media tells us, they're so virtuous.
[01:16:36.736 --> 01:16:39.297]  They're so loving.
[01:16:39.297 --> 01:16:40.758]  They're the new enforcer.
[01:16:43.809 --> 01:16:47.531]  In Europe.
[01:16:47.531 --> 01:16:48.812]  Julian Assange.
[01:16:48.812 --> 01:16:49.653]  Oh, the big liberal.
[01:16:49.653 --> 01:16:51.073]  A real liberal.
[01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:56.257]  Hacked emails include info on Hillary's arming of jihadists, including ISIS in Syria.
[01:16:56.257 --> 01:16:58.978]  Well, we know she did that, but yes, they've got them.
[01:16:58.978 --> 01:17:00.239]  He says they're about to be released.
[01:17:00.239 --> 01:17:00.619]  Good.
[01:17:00.619 --> 01:17:01.380]  Release them now.
[01:17:04.377 --> 01:17:12.063]  Hillary Clinton denied she knew about weapons shipments during public testimony under oath in early 2013 after a Benghazi terrorist attack.
[01:17:12.063 --> 01:17:18.849]  Senator Rand Paul questioned Hillary Clinton about the gun running program back in 2013 during her testimony on the Benghazi terrorist attack.
[01:17:18.849 --> 01:17:24.334]  Assange told Democracy Now!, the WikiLeaks DMC emails contains information on the weapons shipments to Syria.
[01:17:24.334 --> 01:17:28.257]  We already know from people that did it, we had the whistleblowers on.
[01:17:28.257 --> 01:17:29.578]  It's now been admitted they were arming them.
[01:17:34.301 --> 01:17:35.542]  And then it gets worse.
[01:17:35.542 --> 01:17:37.084]  The Clinton Foundation.
[01:17:37.084 --> 01:17:41.328]  State and Kremlin connections.
[01:17:41.328 --> 01:17:43.070]  Why did Hillary's State Department urge U.S.
[01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:47.074]  investors to fund Russia's research for military uses and give them uranium?
[01:17:47.074 --> 01:17:53.441]  And her own chief of staff got $35 million from a Putin group to transfer weapons.
[01:17:53.441 --> 01:17:55.183]  You ask, why would they do stuff like this?
[01:17:59.815 --> 01:18:08.080]  Because the globalists are weapons merchants and they want to play both sides of the equation.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:12.002]  And they've always got technology a couple generations ahead of it.
[01:18:12.002 --> 01:18:20.566]  And they're all tricked by the spirit of this world that they're going to somehow manage all this and control all this when really they're just going to destroy the planet.
[01:18:20.566 --> 01:18:24.288]  Which is what the devil is out to do.
[01:18:24.288 --> 01:18:25.109]  But not until
[01:18:27.745 --> 01:18:35.631]  The globalists supposedly have their artificial transcendent technology to merge and become binary silicon lifeforms.
[01:18:35.631 --> 01:18:38.693]  And I know the New York Times, everybody makes jokes when I talk about that.
[01:18:38.693 --> 01:18:43.317]  I'm quoting the head of Google technology development, Kurzweil.
[01:18:43.317 --> 01:18:49.601]  I'm quoting here the cosmology, the religion of the controllers.

[01:20:17.996 --> 01:20:22.440]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases.
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:22.660]  I think?
[01:20:41.508 --> 01:20:45.493]  Of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for M4 Wars listeners.

[01:21:59.383 --> 01:22:02.036]  Today, I became a bio-photon woman.
[01:22:02.036 --> 01:22:03.081]  I put a tablespoon of...
[01:22:09.629 --> 01:22:15.032]  Normally I feel tired and spacey at the end of the day, but today I felt energy and very clear.
[01:22:15.032 --> 01:22:17.433]  My friend at the farmer's market asked what I was on.
[01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:21.876]  She said my eyes looked bright and I had unusual energy for that time of afternoon.
[01:22:21.876 --> 01:22:27.379]  I told her there was a magical oil that enabled my body to absorb the sun's energy as if I were a plant.
[01:22:27.379 --> 01:22:29.100]  She said, I want some.
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:35.363]  A second One World Way shake with the oil when I got home took me to bedtime with that wonderful abundant energy.
[01:22:35.903 --> 01:22:39.146]  I couldn't believe how much I got done and how great I felt.
[01:22:39.146 --> 01:22:44.811]  The combination of One World Way and Five Seed Oil produced a significant health event in my life.

[01:24:10.688 --> 01:24:12.910]  All right, there's a article that just went up.
[01:24:12.910 --> 01:24:14.432]  We're going to red link on Infowars.com.
[01:24:14.432 --> 01:24:17.274]  It's got two investigative video reports in it.
[01:24:17.274 --> 01:24:21.538]  I'm asking everyone to send this out on your Twitter, your Facebook, YouTube, everywhere.
[01:24:21.538 --> 01:24:24.320]  Crooked Hillary will try to steal election from Trump.
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:27.964]  If she stole the primary, she's going to steal the general, Warren's Alex Jones.
[01:24:28.871 --> 01:24:31.613]  And then we're going to have a bunch of investigative reports breaking all this down.
[01:24:31.613 --> 01:24:33.914]  Right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:24:33.914 --> 01:24:40.899]  Corey and Corey and Michael and Christian and Peter and many, many others.
[01:24:40.899 --> 01:24:44.962]  Let's go ahead and talk to Corey in Washington.
[01:24:44.962 --> 01:24:45.502]  You're on the air.
[01:24:45.502 --> 01:24:49.585]  This is, is this Alex?
[01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:49.905]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:49.905 --> 01:24:51.726]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:24:51.726 --> 01:24:53.888]  Hey, hey, much respect to you.
[01:24:53.888 --> 01:24:55.329]  Thank you so much for taking my call.
[01:24:56.016 --> 01:24:58.979]  I'm a veteran out of Washington State.
[01:24:58.979 --> 01:25:05.124]  I'm actually from Oregon, Grand Pass, Oregon, and served 12 years, went to Iraq.
[01:25:05.124 --> 01:25:07.386]  God bless you, brother.
[01:25:07.386 --> 01:25:09.929]  Yeah, I got some great news for you, though.
[01:25:09.929 --> 01:25:18.797]  I got the anthrax vaccine in Germany in 2002, and then shortly thereafter started suffering some pretty bad blisters.
[01:25:20.819 --> 01:25:28.882]  They kind of like discarded it as, you know, it was just an autoimmune disorder called erythema multiforme.
[01:25:28.882 --> 01:25:38.825]  And then in 2012, after I got out, I had a severe reaction that caused blisters all over my body.
[01:25:38.825 --> 01:25:41.006]  And once that went down,
[01:25:41.559 --> 01:25:43.521]  They started doing, you know, biopsies on me.
[01:25:43.521 --> 01:25:46.163]  The VA did a little bit more research on it.
[01:25:46.163 --> 01:25:51.828]  And they come to find out this last year, after being hospitalized for three days, it was a disease called Bechette's disease.
[01:25:52.612 --> 01:25:57.313]  And Bouchette's is like an extreme neurological disorder that causes, you know, brain lesions.
[01:25:57.313 --> 01:25:58.354]  No, I know what it is.
[01:25:58.354 --> 01:25:59.754]  Gardasil does this to people, too.
[01:25:59.754 --> 01:26:01.475]  This is a standard.
[01:26:01.475 --> 01:26:02.795]  That's an experimental vaccine.
[01:26:02.795 --> 01:26:04.716]  They had to stop doing it three times.
[01:26:04.716 --> 01:26:06.496]  They are literally soft-killing the troops.
[01:26:06.496 --> 01:26:08.817]  It doesn't protect you from anthrax.
[01:26:08.817 --> 01:26:10.317]  We've covered this extensively.
[01:26:10.317 --> 01:26:11.358]  It's horrible.
[01:26:11.358 --> 01:26:12.718]  And I'm so sorry they did that to you.
[01:26:12.718 --> 01:26:19.560]  Of course, they'll tell you there's no side effects and it's totally safe, even though the insert says this is experimental and only by order of the Department of Defense.
[01:26:21.378 --> 01:26:26.064]  And then they basically said, hey, if you don't get this shot, you're going to spend 24 hours on CQ duty.
[01:26:26.064 --> 01:26:26.424]  You know?
[01:26:26.424 --> 01:26:31.009]  And we just said, I was the guy back then where the only thing I wanted to do was serve my country.
[01:26:31.009 --> 01:26:33.171]  I mean, I didn't care about going and killing people.
[01:26:33.171 --> 01:26:34.853]  9-11 just happened.
[01:26:34.853 --> 01:26:35.474]  Sure, I understand.
[01:26:35.474 --> 01:26:36.635]  So, sir, you're saying good news.
[01:26:36.635 --> 01:26:37.556]  This sounds like bad news.
[01:26:37.556 --> 01:26:37.957]  What happened?
[01:26:38.527 --> 01:26:43.930]  Well, the good news is that, so this last year, you know, I had a really heart-to-heart with God.
[01:26:43.930 --> 01:26:50.234]  Basically came down to saying, all right, well, this is your body, this is your soul, this is your country, all right?
[01:26:50.234 --> 01:26:54.016]  So how are you going to fix your country if you cannot fix yourself?
[01:26:54.016 --> 01:27:06.204]  And it was at the point where I was hearing, you know, delusional voices, and the VA kept on saying, well, it's just a skin disorder, that's post-traumatic stress disorder, you might have another problem with your brain, or, you know, you might have- If he has an autoimmune thing on the brain, yeah.
[01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:07.568]  Correct.
[01:27:07.568 --> 01:27:13.251]  So all these manifestations started happening, it basically got to the point where it's like, God, I'm hearing these voices.
[01:27:13.251 --> 01:27:16.332]  I don't know if it's you, or if it's something else out there.
[01:27:16.332 --> 01:27:17.893]  I need clarity.
[01:27:17.893 --> 01:27:21.775]  And so it came down to the point where it's like, I wanted to just kill myself.
[01:27:21.775 --> 01:27:29.979]  You know, I mean, you call it the 1-800-SUICIDE-LINE, and the first thing they ask you, they don't even ask you your name, they ask you, are you suicidal?
[01:27:31.019 --> 01:27:32.200]  Every human being right now.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:38.624]  Yeah, they're trying to get you in the system, they're trying to not give you hope, and they want you to kill yourself at these systems.
[01:27:38.624 --> 01:27:41.226]  But that's why we have record suicides, 24 a day.
[01:27:41.226 --> 01:27:43.107]  So what else happened?
[01:27:43.107 --> 01:27:49.312]  So basically what had occurred was the only thing that kept me grounded was psychedelics, to be honest with you.
[01:27:49.312 --> 01:27:55.616]  And I'd only been starting psychedelics to integrate into a therapy called holographic epistemology.
[01:27:56.204 --> 01:28:04.228]  And epistemology is obviously the history of, you know, the grounded roots, the logos, you know, the spirit, the ancient, you know.
[01:28:04.228 --> 01:28:04.809]  So what happened?
[01:28:04.809 --> 01:28:07.750]  I mean, were you able spiritually to transcend this or what happened?
[01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:09.271]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:28:09.271 --> 01:28:15.394]  So it basically came down to two different things was my own personal history and my bad habits.
[01:28:15.394 --> 01:28:18.296]  So it was basically I had to control my habits in my life.
[01:28:18.857 --> 01:28:19.338]  Thank you.
[01:28:30.686 --> 01:28:41.974]  And I realized, you know, I was putting in so much bad junk into my system to include bad information, bad reading, bad talk.
[01:28:41.974 --> 01:28:44.296]  Everything was so wrong.
[01:28:44.296 --> 01:28:51.902]  And so it wasn't that I was seeing it myself, but something was being introduced into my diet that was actually making me say, okay,
[01:28:52.202 --> 01:28:52.622]  Absolutely.
[01:28:52.622 --> 01:28:53.463]  It all works together.
[01:28:53.463 --> 01:28:54.443]  We're almost out of time, brother.
[01:28:54.443 --> 01:28:57.504]  We're taking calls here, but I appreciate your testimony.
[01:28:57.504 --> 01:29:05.328]  What it comes down to is, I'll be at a party with my kids, and I'll see the Doritos with MSG, I tell them don't eat it, they eat it, and then they act like demons.
[01:29:05.328 --> 01:29:10.450]  I mean, as long as they don't get aspartame or MSG or red dye number whatever, they're great kids.
[01:29:10.450 --> 01:29:12.851]  And this is all pharmakea.
[01:29:12.851 --> 01:29:15.152]  This is how the globalists control us.
[01:29:15.152 --> 01:29:15.892]  We got 30 seconds.
[01:29:15.892 --> 01:29:16.653]  How did it end, my friend?
[01:29:16.653 --> 01:29:17.553]  I love your testimony.
[01:29:18.482 --> 01:29:23.204]  We developed a technology in Chicago based upon holographic projectionism.
[01:29:23.204 --> 01:29:24.464]  It's a new technology.
[01:29:24.464 --> 01:29:25.225]  Send me some info.
[01:29:25.225 --> 01:29:26.785]  I appreciate your call.
[01:29:26.785 --> 01:29:27.866]  We have a lot of callers here.
[01:29:27.866 --> 01:29:31.007]  Corey wants to talk about Drudge Headline and Hillary in emails.
[01:29:31.007 --> 01:29:32.708]  We got Peter wants to talk about the election.
[01:29:32.708 --> 01:29:34.269]  Christian wants to talk about Trump.
[01:29:34.269 --> 01:29:35.769]  Russia hacked emails.
[01:29:35.769 --> 01:29:38.530]  Michael wants to talk about assassination of Trump.
[01:29:38.530 --> 01:29:45.133]  So we'll talk about all of that and then we're going to be getting on the line, Joel Scowls in a World Affairs Brief.
[01:29:45.133 --> 01:29:45.673]  Stay with us.
[01:29:45.673 --> 01:29:47.274]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:29:49.369 --> 01:29:53.312]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.312 --> 01:30:00.217]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.217 --> 01:30:02.980]  And what's likely another attempt to downplay Islamic terrorism.
[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:08.064]  London authorities covered up an attempted car bombing on Saturday night, according to a source who reached out to InfoWars.
[01:30:08.064 --> 01:30:16.450]  Camden Lock, a popular area for club goers, was evacuated by police after a report about a suspicious vehicle attempted EPM local time, as reported by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:30:16.570 --> 01:30:24.035]  Metropolitan Police sent in a bomb robot to check the car and sequentially announced that the vehicle was not deemed too suspicious and officers were stood down.
[01:30:24.035 --> 01:30:31.479]  However, according to an employee who works at one of the venues that was evacuated, he saw information that suggests the incident was in fact an attempted terrorist attack.
[01:30:31.479 --> 01:30:37.283]  The bomb was real, he said, adding that the device contained shrapnel and that the car was filled with gas canisters.
[01:30:37.283 --> 01:30:40.505]  Additionally, the vehicle had no registered owner and no insurance.
[01:30:40.845 --> 01:30:48.627]  The employee also said, quote, the car was parked in a very high-traffic area with busy clubs and pubs all around, including a sold-out open-air event.
[01:30:48.627 --> 01:30:50.968]  If it went off, a lot of people wouldn't have made it home that night.
[01:30:50.968 --> 01:30:53.408]  The mainstream media won't report on it, so maybe you will.
[01:30:53.408 --> 01:30:58.450]  And for more news the mainstream media won't cover out of fear of political correctness, visit Infowars.com.
[01:30:58.450 --> 01:30:59.610]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[01:30:59.870 --> 01:31:00.391]  Not agree.
[01:31:00.391 --> 01:31:01.812]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:31:01.812 --> 01:31:03.133]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:31:03.133 --> 01:31:04.334]  Why is this so good?
[01:31:04.334 --> 01:31:09.638]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:31:09.638 --> 01:31:23.189]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:24.551]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:31:25.451 --> 01:31:26.952]  Spreading disease around.
[01:31:26.952 --> 01:31:29.532]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:31:29.532 --> 01:31:30.833]  These are all parasites.
[01:31:30.833 --> 01:31:31.933]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:31:31.933 --> 01:31:33.273]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:31:33.273 --> 01:31:37.775]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:31:37.775 --> 01:31:40.936]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:31:40.936 --> 01:31:44.137]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:31:44.137 --> 01:31:45.177]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:31:45.177 --> 01:31:45.997]  Living Defense.
[01:31:45.997 --> 01:31:47.098]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:47.098 --> 01:31:48.118]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:31:48.118 --> 01:31:50.139]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:52.743]  You support the broadcast.
[01:31:52.743 --> 01:31:54.087]  Infowarslives.com.
[01:31:54.087 --> 01:31:56.334]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:31:56.334 --> 01:31:58.300]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:31:59.870 --> 01:32:00.531]  Uh, yeah.
[01:32:00.531 --> 01:32:06.356]  First of all, I want to say, take the 12X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[01:32:06.356 --> 01:32:07.316]  I use them all.
[01:32:07.316 --> 01:32:08.297]  They're phenomenal.
[01:32:08.297 --> 01:32:09.038]  They work.
[01:32:09.038 --> 01:32:09.858]  Buy them, folks.
[01:32:09.858 --> 01:32:10.359]  Thank you, brother.
[01:32:10.359 --> 01:32:12.280]  I want to thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:18.506]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[01:32:18.506 --> 01:32:20.487]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[01:32:20.487 --> 01:32:25.912]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[01:32:26.312 --> 01:32:27.053]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[01:32:27.053 --> 01:32:30.816]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, QFX, nascent iodine.
[01:32:30.816 --> 01:32:31.736]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:32:31.736 --> 01:32:32.777]  Have they worked for you?
[01:32:32.777 --> 01:32:35.639]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:32:35.639 --> 01:32:36.980]  What products are you taking?
[01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:45.006]  Everything from Super Male to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA Force.
[01:32:45.006 --> 01:32:48.469]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:53.672]  Visit Infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[01:32:53.672 --> 01:32:56.534]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:56.534 --> 01:33:04.739]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.312 --> 01:33:19.893]  Alright, we're back.
[01:33:19.893 --> 01:33:23.577]  The Pope's openly announcing world government, saying open your borders up.
[01:33:23.577 --> 01:33:25.039]  There's no such thing as Muslim terror.
[01:33:25.039 --> 01:33:27.061]  The PSYOP has intensified.
[01:33:27.061 --> 01:33:33.828]  Former head of the NSA, a technical division, has come out and said, look, they got copies of all of Hillary's emails.
[01:33:33.828 --> 01:33:35.050]  That's a really good point to make.
[01:33:36.223 --> 01:33:38.565]  We've got a new story up on Infowars.com.
[01:33:38.565 --> 01:33:41.787]  Crooked Hillary will try to steal the election from Trump.
[01:33:41.787 --> 01:33:44.309]  If she stole the primary, she's going to steal the general.
[01:33:44.309 --> 01:33:46.711]  And again, people say, well, what do you do about the fraud?
[01:33:46.711 --> 01:33:48.773]  You have a landslide to counter that.
[01:33:48.773 --> 01:33:57.259]  But more importantly, you point out she stole it from Sanders and make that the ongoing issue to get the Sanders voters.
[01:33:57.259 --> 01:34:00.282]  And I can tell you that people close to Trump
[01:34:01.385 --> 01:34:03.246]  As close as you can get.
[01:34:03.246 --> 01:34:07.449]  Know that that is a major, major, major issue.
[01:34:07.449 --> 01:34:10.011]  And they're actually looking at how you broach it.
[01:34:10.011 --> 01:34:11.812]  But you have this whole compendium of corruption.
[01:34:11.812 --> 01:34:13.153]  So people understand it.
[01:34:13.153 --> 01:34:14.975]  They know it.
[01:34:14.975 --> 01:34:16.556]  Trump has said he's taking the gloves off.
[01:34:16.556 --> 01:34:24.882]  We are going to be putting together, this just begins it, investigative reports with all the video clips, all the documentation, all the numbers.
[01:34:26.004 --> 01:34:40.792]  That show how they stole it from Sanders, how they try to steal it from Trump, and where all this is going to be going, and how they're fixing Google, fixing Facebook, fixing the Reuters polls, top pollsters, or even non-partisan are coming out saying this is total fraud.
[01:34:40.792 --> 01:34:44.454]  And people say, well, she'll just steal it.
[01:34:44.454 --> 01:34:48.896]  No, all the experts agree, it's hard to steal a landslide.
[01:34:48.896 --> 01:34:50.457]  And then Trump will be able to challenge that.
[01:34:53.311 --> 01:35:01.351]  So we have to make the issue that she is crooked and has lied and has stolen things before, so that when they try it again, they don't get away with it.
[01:35:02.008 --> 01:35:03.548]  We're affecting the battle space.
[01:35:03.548 --> 01:35:15.451]  Now, Phil Skousen is going to be with us about 40 minutes to the next hour, then I'll cover news the last 20 minutes, then we have, coming up after that, in the fourth hour, David Knight, who always does a great job, in the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[01:35:15.451 --> 01:35:17.672]  But I promised to go to more of your calls today, so we will.
[01:35:17.672 --> 01:35:20.512]  In fact, in the last 20-30 minutes of the next hour, we'll do that as well.
[01:35:20.512 --> 01:35:27.174]  I don't want to go to folks who have been holding since the last hour, then we'll go to the editor of World Affairs Brief, Phil Skousen, to cover the waterfront.
[01:35:27.654 --> 01:35:33.838]  And give us his informative perspective on things that are happening around the world.
[01:35:33.838 --> 01:35:36.320]  I just want a laundry list with Joel Skousen today.
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:48.468]  Everything from Zika popping up in Florida, 10 cases, to what's happening with the economy, what's happening with Russia, what's happening with the emails, all of this and a lot more today.
[01:35:48.468 --> 01:35:52.591]  But right now, let's go to Christian in Louisiana.
[01:35:52.591 --> 01:35:53.612]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:35:53.612 --> 01:35:53.892]  Go ahead.
[01:35:55.154 --> 01:35:58.998]  Yes sir, very glad to be talking to you for Suncaller.
[01:35:58.998 --> 01:35:59.638]  Thank you.
[01:35:59.638 --> 01:36:13.111]  A couple years ago, during the Ukrainian crisis, I did a lot of extensive research into Russia because dad fought communists for all of the Ukrainian army and all that, but I did a lot of research on the different things.
[01:36:13.111 --> 01:36:16.014]  We're going to get Joel Skousen's take on that in a minute, go ahead.
[01:36:17.150 --> 01:36:28.839]  But over the recent thing with the mainstream media arguing, like, Donald Trump's doing treason because he's asking Russia for help with this, about the e-bills, and it's affecting our party.
[01:36:28.839 --> 01:36:30.160]  Quick, with me.
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:31.541]  There was a treaty signed.
[01:36:31.541 --> 01:36:40.408]  It was called the United States of America Treaty with the Russian Federation over mutual... To fight organized crime.
[01:36:40.408 --> 01:36:41.749]  Of criminal matters.
[01:36:41.749 --> 01:36:43.851]  It was actually signed by Bill Clinton, and it allows
[01:36:44.845 --> 01:36:51.328]  The two parties between Russia and America to trade informational records, history, documents, and everything.
[01:36:51.328 --> 01:36:53.989]  Sure, but that's classified information.
[01:36:53.989 --> 01:36:57.090]  Look, the issue is he doesn't have these Russian connections.
[01:36:57.090 --> 01:37:03.372]  Hillary has been selling out our uranium, our weapons secrets to the Chinese, to the Russians, and to everybody.
[01:37:03.372 --> 01:37:08.054]  So it's ridiculous for her to claim that somehow Trump works with Putin.
[01:37:08.054 --> 01:37:09.055]  Clearly the Russians
[01:37:10.175 --> 01:37:13.457]  Don't want Hillary in there because she's so hawkish.
[01:37:13.457 --> 01:37:18.761]  And so clearly the Russians have been involved in a lot of this, both from my own research and sources.
[01:37:18.761 --> 01:37:19.521]  But I hear you.
[01:37:19.521 --> 01:37:20.662]  That's a great point, Christian.
[01:37:20.662 --> 01:37:24.985]  There are laws that Russia and the United States supposedly are going to work together fighting organized crime.
[01:37:24.985 --> 01:37:25.385]  Great point.
[01:37:25.385 --> 01:37:27.746]  OK, I'm going to move quick because I want to go to our guest.
[01:37:27.746 --> 01:37:29.828]  Let's go ahead and talk to Peter in Michigan.
[01:37:29.828 --> 01:37:30.348]  You're on the air.
[01:37:30.348 --> 01:37:31.929]  Go ahead.
[01:37:31.929 --> 01:37:33.630]  Alex Jones, what's up, man?
[01:37:33.630 --> 01:37:35.351]  Hey, brother.
[01:37:35.351 --> 01:37:36.032]  Hey, man.
[01:37:36.032 --> 01:37:37.693]  We love you over here.
[01:37:37.693 --> 01:37:38.653]  Great stuff.
[01:37:38.653 --> 01:37:39.394]  We watch you every night.
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:46.966]  So I was watching one of your videos last night and you were talking about, you know, there's an emergency alert and a landslide and whatnot.
[01:37:46.966 --> 01:37:50.970]  And, you know, I really see that landslide happening.
[01:37:50.970 --> 01:37:56.975]  You know, if you look at Democrats or Republicans or even Independents and what's been going on, like in Detroit they built like some satanic altar.
[01:37:57.925 --> 01:38:01.166]  You look at, in New York, they're trying to build the arches of Baal.
[01:38:01.166 --> 01:38:04.648]  They're trying to have a... They're not trying to teach in public school Satanism.
[01:38:04.648 --> 01:38:08.369]  An after-school Satan club could be coming to your kid's elementary school.
[01:38:08.369 --> 01:38:18.053]  With all the criminal behavior connected to Satanism and everything, parents would be insane to let their kids even go to a school that has a Satan club.
[01:38:18.053 --> 01:38:19.253]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:38:19.253 --> 01:38:24.875]  And just piggybacking on what you said, little boys and little girls taking showers together, if you really read that bill, I mean, that's what it's pushing.
[01:38:24.875 --> 01:38:26.896]  What it is is it's weak people looking for power.
[01:38:28.171 --> 01:38:43.480]  So if you look at, like, whether you're Democrat or Republican, people are just, you know, with your show kind of exposing everything and just people kind of waking up, like you said, maybe being deprogrammed, I don't see how Trump can't win in a landslide.
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:47.282]  I mean, it's just, you have good and evil almost.
[01:38:47.282 --> 01:38:54.726]  Well, it's the demographics, though, of the blue states and all the election fraud.
[01:38:54.726 --> 01:38:57.228]  There's a lot of evidence that 7 to 10 percent are closeted.
[01:38:58.863 --> 01:38:59.023]  Hey Alex.
[01:39:28.042 --> 01:39:32.624]  Listen, I wanted to bring up an issue.
[01:39:32.624 --> 01:39:41.868]  I was reading the other day about how they're letting the guy that tried to kill Reagan out of prison.
[01:39:41.868 --> 01:39:42.589]  John Hinckley Jr.
[01:39:42.589 --> 01:39:42.689]  Yep.
[01:39:45.666 --> 01:39:51.971]  I was wondering if you think maybe they'll try to use him to try to assassinate Trump, since they are obviously losing.
[01:39:51.971 --> 01:40:10.484]  You know, I thought it was like an omen or a bellwether, but I don't like to... I didn't comment on air, but you asked, that after 35 years of him being in the mental institution, and of course his family meeting with the Bushes, according to the Denver Post, days before, and that whole creepy thing and what was done, and the fact that Reagan and
[01:40:12.156 --> 01:40:16.218]  Of course, Herbert Walker were basically enemies.
[01:40:16.218 --> 01:40:22.621]  And Reagan, you know, would quote John Birch Society material and things and talk about the New World Order of Trilateral Commission.
[01:40:22.621 --> 01:40:26.123]  When he was running against Bush, he was forced in 1980 to put him on the ticket.
[01:40:26.123 --> 01:40:31.245]  I thought that was really, really weird and just signifies, hey, you know, you do something for us, we'll let you out.
[01:40:31.245 --> 01:40:37.488]  He's had a pampered lifestyle, reportedly, with his own little wing of the facility for 35 years.
[01:40:37.488 --> 01:40:39.469]  And I think the guy should be executed.
[01:40:39.989 --> 01:40:46.090]  Well, I completely agree and I find the timing just, you know, very suspicious and I'm afraid for Donald Trump and I hope that they don't try to take our savior from us.
[01:41:01.519 --> 01:41:17.491]  Well, I don't want to call him our savior, and Donald Trump's got his own issues, but he's anti-globalist, he isn't out to get the country, he's been against AFTENGAP for 20-something years, and they're scared to death of him, and the whole power structure's against him because he does sing to his own sheet of music.
[01:41:17.491 --> 01:41:28.479]  And their entire world government program, the Washington Post, the Economist magazine, the Financial Times of London, the People's Daily in China, they've all hit the alarm bells and said, world government's in trouble, we've got to get Hillary in.
[01:41:29.039 --> 01:41:34.464]  So shame on all the Bernie people and anybody else if you don't vote for Trump.
[01:41:34.464 --> 01:41:37.947]  It is a referendum on free and open elections in this country.
[01:41:37.947 --> 01:41:43.952]  But even if they steal it from him, Hillary's got so much baggage that their program is in trouble.
[01:41:43.952 --> 01:41:45.854]  I know we've got unlimited calls, 800-259-9231.
[01:41:45.854 --> 01:41:49.517]  We'll take some later if folks want to hold.
[01:41:49.517 --> 01:41:56.663]  But I now want to go to Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief, former Marine Corps officer, fighter, pilot in the Vietnam era, patriot.
[01:41:57.023 --> 01:42:00.184]  Comes from a long line of patriots, Cleon Skousen, the naked communist.
[01:42:00.184 --> 01:42:09.108]  The folks back at the beginning, 60 years ago, ringing the alarm bells and being proven right about what we face.
[01:42:09.108 --> 01:42:09.808]  What we face.
[01:42:09.808 --> 01:42:13.570]  I mean, Joseph McCarthy, they've released a lot of the Soviet files.
[01:42:13.570 --> 01:42:17.832]  And as soon as he said, our government's funding the communists, boom, they removed him.
[01:42:17.832 --> 01:42:24.174]  It's okay to say there's communists and take American rights to fight it, but not to say it was a program of the ultra-rich.
[01:42:24.174 --> 01:42:25.975]  Carol Quigley later wrote a book admitting it.
[01:42:27.654 --> 01:42:30.277]  And that was because people at the State Department couldn't understand.
[01:42:30.277 --> 01:42:32.620]  We're fascist, we're communist, we're authoritarian.
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:33.260]  What's going on?
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:33.721]  Who are we?
[01:42:33.721 --> 01:42:36.103]  And he explained how it worked to them.
[01:42:36.103 --> 01:42:44.333]  They've got all these different flavors of authoritarianism that the central banks globally manipulate and play off against each other in a dialectic to consolidate control.
[01:42:45.589 --> 01:42:54.619]  But now, their whole project's in trouble, to the point they've got to have the Pope uncloak himself and come out and just call for stuff that is unbelievable.
[01:42:54.619 --> 01:42:58.644]  Joel Skousen, you heard a lot of those questions that the listeners were bringing up.
[01:42:58.644 --> 01:43:00.166]  There's so many things to tackle.
[01:43:00.166 --> 01:43:04.631]  In a few minutes, tell us some of the things you think we should go over today, and then obviously we'll cover the waterfront.
[01:43:04.631 --> 01:43:05.192]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:43:06.314 --> 01:43:08.275]  Well, it's good to be with you, Alex.
[01:43:08.275 --> 01:43:13.757]  Of course, we need to cover the election and Donald Trump and how they plan on defeating him.
[01:43:13.757 --> 01:43:20.440]  And, you know, what Trump is not doing, I think, to help out his own cause, that's of serious concern to me.
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:28.524]  I think we need to talk about, you know, the cover-up of Hillary, the kind of immunity that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have.
[01:43:28.524 --> 01:43:30.465]  We need to talk about the Republicans that are
[01:43:30.945 --> 01:43:34.387]  Switching sides and planning on voting for Hillary Clinton.
[01:43:34.387 --> 01:43:38.549]  It's interesting to see who they are and what that portends.
[01:43:38.549 --> 01:43:54.076]  We also need to talk, I think, about the Middle East and where that's going in terms of ISIS and trying to defeat it, which Donald Trump says he's going to do, but I don't think he can.
[01:43:54.076 --> 01:43:57.098]  Well, let's start with the election.
[01:43:58.916 --> 01:44:05.762]  Well, the important point I think is that I am really not convinced that we're going to have a landslide yet.
[01:44:05.762 --> 01:44:09.165]  We could very easily have a landslide if Donald Trump
[01:44:09.941 --> 01:44:11.982]  Would be more careful about what he says.
[01:44:11.982 --> 01:44:15.364]  He seems to have a very sore spot about being attacked.
[01:44:15.364 --> 01:44:24.088]  When he got attacked by Mr. and Mrs. Khan at the Democratic National Day, he came out in a reactionary way of condemning them.
[01:44:24.088 --> 01:44:34.013]  Instead of saying, for example, you know, the politically astute thing would have been to say, look, Mr. and Mrs. Khan, you are not the kind of people that I would have stopped from coming into the country.
[01:44:34.013 --> 01:44:35.694]  I did not say stop all Muslims.
[01:44:36.690 --> 01:44:39.351]  I said we stop it until we have a proper vetting process.
[01:44:39.351 --> 01:44:44.793]  And you obviously would have gone through and achieved the proper vetting.
[01:44:44.793 --> 01:44:57.678]  I mean, he would have gained tons of points, but you cannot come out and attack a set of parents whose child or whose son was killed in the military.
[01:44:57.678 --> 01:44:59.298]  You just can't do that.
[01:44:59.298 --> 01:45:01.399]  And it's the same thing of attacking the Mexican judge.
[01:45:01.399 --> 01:45:02.879]  It just wasn't well thought out of.
[01:45:04.648 --> 01:45:20.051]  You know, with a 60 plus point negative rating that Hillary Clinton has and Donald Trump has, the one who's going to win this election are the ones who are going to appeal to the 40% that aren't part of these two solid blocks of socialist Democrats.
[01:45:20.612 --> 01:45:26.273]  Turning to Hillary and pro-globalist people turning Hillary and the anti-establishment people.
[01:45:26.273 --> 01:45:30.794]  There's a solid 30% block that's for Donald Trump, but there's a massive block of 40%.
[01:45:30.794 --> 01:45:34.815]  But Donald Trump's got to get a significant amount of that.
[01:45:34.815 --> 01:45:39.597]  They want to believe there's someone else other than the establishment.
[01:45:39.597 --> 01:45:47.839]  But I just am waiting for Donald Trump to show some restraint in terms of what he reacts to when he gets attacked.
[01:45:47.839 --> 01:45:49.199]  So I'm concerned about that, Alex.
[01:45:50.424 --> 01:45:53.865]  Now I really think that they are going to throw the election.
[01:45:53.865 --> 01:46:09.152]  Look, when Brent Scowcroft, when Richard Armitage, when Henry Poulsen, and a half a dozen other big-name globalists, neocons, Bob Kagan, come out and endorse Hillary Clinton, these are nominal Republicans.
[01:46:09.152 --> 01:46:10.412]  I mean, these are neocons.
[01:46:10.412 --> 01:46:12.293]  These are people who aren't true Republicans.
[01:46:12.293 --> 01:46:18.556]  So it's no big deal for them to come out and say that, except that it is providing kind of a bandwagon effect
[01:46:19.036 --> 01:46:25.822]  That other liberal Republicans may be swayed or moderate Republicans may be swayed to vote for Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:25.822 --> 01:46:34.409]  I mean, as I pointed out last election in 2012, when they tried to say, you know, you're eliminated, you had 8 million less people who voted in 2012 than 2008.
[01:46:34.409 --> 01:46:35.370]  I just found that incredible, unbelievable.
[01:46:38.993 --> 01:46:42.494]  There was so much more intensity against Barack Obama.
[01:46:42.494 --> 01:46:49.156]  And even with Mitt Romney's problems, I mean, he was fairly charismatic, he was a good-looking person, he was well-spoken.
[01:46:49.156 --> 01:46:58.058]  There's just no way that he would have pulled less people than John McCain did, who's, you know, a turncoat, a rhino Republican.
[01:46:58.058 --> 01:47:01.839]  Nobody trusted John McCain except the middle-of-the-road people.
[01:47:02.979 --> 01:47:09.503]  I think that at the federal level they actually eliminated 8 to 10 million votes to re-elect Barack Obama.
[01:47:09.503 --> 01:47:10.143]  Well that's right.
[01:47:10.143 --> 01:47:18.608]  Mitt Romney was way better and much more popular and more charismatic than McCain, who was a total stand-in, shill, quizzling.
[01:47:18.608 --> 01:47:21.390]  So definitely there is election fraud going on.
[01:47:21.390 --> 01:47:23.071]  What does Donald Trump do about that?
[01:47:23.071 --> 01:47:24.792]  I mean, she stole the nomination.
[01:47:24.792 --> 01:47:26.073]  I think he makes it all about this.
[01:47:27.665 --> 01:47:31.969]  Well, I think you have to look at how the nomination was stolen.
[01:47:31.969 --> 01:47:37.514]  The technique is different than what they would have to do to steal an election from Donald Trump.
[01:47:37.514 --> 01:47:39.555]  I mean, for example, they had the superdelegates.
[01:47:39.555 --> 01:47:44.179]  They had loaded the loaded dice against Sanders from the very beginning.
[01:47:44.179 --> 01:47:52.407]  And there was some actual vote fraud during some of the elections, the five major eastern cities that should have gone to Sanders that went to Hillary Clinton.
[01:47:52.407 --> 01:47:53.768]  But, you know, it's awfully and
[01:47:54.088 --> 01:48:02.995]  You notice they didn't do exit polling, of course, in primaries, and so it becomes very easy to fudge the actual results.
[01:48:02.995 --> 01:48:10.881]  I mean, that's one of the ways that the Brexit vote went against them, is they had paper ballots instead of electronic voting, and they didn't have exit polling.
[01:48:10.881 --> 01:48:14.744]  So it made it very, very difficult, even though they probably tried.
[01:48:14.744 --> 01:48:18.086]  Sir, Joel, just to be clear, though, I'm not even talking about trying to block the theft.
[01:48:18.086 --> 01:48:19.107]  Let's talk about that next.
[01:48:20.288 --> 01:48:28.074]  I'm saying make it a big issue that Hillary stole the primary, had the delegates come in and ignore the popular vote, and make that the issue.
[01:48:28.074 --> 01:48:31.477]  Because that, to me, is the biggest naked fraud out there so far.
[01:48:32.848 --> 01:48:33.909]  Right.
[01:48:33.909 --> 01:48:34.950]  I completely agree, Alex.
[01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:36.591]  It's a good point to make.
[01:48:36.591 --> 01:48:41.615]  But when you prepare for, you know, the national election, there will be exit polling.
[01:48:41.615 --> 01:48:55.906]  And exit polling means that they've got to keep the fudging of the votes within 10 percent or people say, wow, something's really wrong when it goes when the exit polling differs from the final results by more than 10 percent, even when it violates more than 5 percent.
[01:48:55.906 --> 01:48:58.508]  It's really a problem that they have to explain away.
[01:48:59.148 --> 01:49:11.361]  So, as I say, in 2012, they didn't try to do a lot of state rigging of elections, even though, you know, you have your machines in New York, in Chicago, in LA, and where they can, you know, fudge.
[01:49:11.361 --> 01:49:13.202]  They do a lot of fudging, of course, in 2012 by the
[01:49:14.804 --> 01:49:21.773]  The Supreme Court and other courts were overruling voter ID laws, making sure that any illegal could get in there and vote.
[01:49:21.773 --> 01:49:24.556]  And so that probably accounted for several million votes.
[01:49:24.556 --> 01:49:26.979]  But boy, I tell you, that wasn't enough in 2012.
[01:49:26.979 --> 01:49:31.004]  I think they simply eliminated 10 million votes at the national level.
[01:49:31.004 --> 01:49:33.427]  And so who do you, whose 10 million votes were they?
[01:49:33.427 --> 01:49:34.127]  From what states?
[01:49:35.199 --> 01:49:45.568]  You can't tell, because if a state challenges the federal... Remember in 2012, that's the first time that all the votes from every state was tallied at the national level, not at the state level.
[01:49:45.568 --> 01:49:47.690]  And so it made it very easy to fudge the result.
[01:49:47.690 --> 01:49:52.334]  If any state challenged it, they would say, oh yes, you have exactly what you've given to us.
[01:49:52.334 --> 01:49:55.156]  And they would, you know, adjust the tally from some other state.
[01:49:55.156 --> 01:50:01.142]  It's kind of like a roving, shifting, hide the peanut under the walnut shell.
[01:50:02.143 --> 01:50:04.184]  They can get away with that at the national level.
[01:50:04.184 --> 01:50:06.446]  And I don't know of any way to stop that, really.
[01:50:06.446 --> 01:50:13.713]  Even paper ballots won't, a challenge won't work at a state level if it's tallied at the national level.
[01:50:13.713 --> 01:50:22.821]  Joel, when we come back, I want to ask you what you think they're going to do if Hillary's able to steal it and get in, versus scenarios if Trump is able to get in.
[01:50:22.821 --> 01:50:24.723]  Because we're only three months out from this happening.
[01:50:25.902 --> 01:50:34.869]  What do you think Obama and the globalists will do in the few months they're still in in December and part of January while they're still sitting in there?
[01:50:34.869 --> 01:50:39.192]  I see they've got contingencies with Paul Ryan.
[01:50:39.192 --> 01:50:39.873]  It's coming out.
[01:50:39.873 --> 01:50:42.555]  Plans to sabotage things if Trump does get in.
[01:50:44.235 --> 01:50:48.477]  And a lot more with Joel Skousen, Editor-in-Chief at WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[01:50:48.477 --> 01:50:50.638]  I'm Alex Jones at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:50.638 --> 01:50:52.799]  Our backup site is PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:52.799 --> 01:50:55.621]  And by the way, there's more and more censorship taking place.
[01:50:55.621 --> 01:50:56.862]  There's an InfoWar going on.
[01:50:56.862 --> 01:50:58.883]  Please spread those articles and videos.
[01:50:58.883 --> 01:51:00.063]  That's what the system hates.
[01:51:00.063 --> 01:51:01.424]  Are you prepared to bug out?
[01:51:01.424 --> 01:51:09.148]  Infidel Body Armor and an Army Ranger have produced a high-speed DVD and book to show you how to drive in combat, patrol, and how to survive in combat.
[01:51:09.428 --> 01:51:09.708]  I think so.
[01:51:30.307 --> 01:51:31.968]  Is your soul immortal?
[01:51:31.968 --> 01:51:37.149]  I was taught that when you die, it was either eternal bliss in heaven or eternal torment in hell.
[01:51:37.149 --> 01:51:40.950]  What if you found out that your soul isn't immortal and that it can die?
[01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:42.671]  We built a website for the curious.
[01:51:42.671 --> 01:51:44.972]  It's called thebiblesaysthat.org.
[01:51:44.972 --> 01:51:47.953]  What you've been taught might not actually be in the Bible.
[01:51:47.953 --> 01:51:55.715]  Thebiblesaysthat.org dismantles misguided religious doctrines and helps you find your own way, your own answers, straight from the Bible.
[01:51:55.715 --> 01:51:58.236]  Find out who's really immortal at thebiblesaysthat.org.
[01:51:59.674 --> 01:52:06.436]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[01:52:06.436 --> 01:52:10.698]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.
[01:52:10.698 --> 01:52:15.319]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size.

[01:52:29.542 --> 01:52:37.646]  There is an affordable alternative to the high cost of health care that offers freedom from insurance while providing compliance with the Obamacare individual mandate.
[01:52:37.646 --> 01:52:43.890]  Imagine having access to quality, affordable health care that allows you the freedom to choose your doctor and hospital.
[01:52:43.890 --> 01:52:49.493]  Members can share up to 100% of necessary medical expenses, including some alternative treatments.
[01:52:49.493 --> 01:52:54.455]  Find out how you and your family can contain health care costs without giving up your freedom.

[01:52:59.418 --> 01:53:07.585]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[01:53:07.585 --> 01:53:08.386]  Here's why.
[01:53:08.386 --> 01:53:12.529]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[01:53:12.529 --> 01:53:13.450]  So please listen.
[01:53:13.450 --> 01:53:17.153]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[01:53:17.153 --> 01:53:23.498]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[01:53:23.498 --> 01:53:27.582]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[01:53:27.822 --> 01:53:30.765]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[01:53:30.765 --> 01:53:33.106]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[01:53:33.106 --> 01:53:37.930]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[01:53:37.930 --> 01:53:44.656]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[01:53:44.656 --> 01:53:46.377]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[01:53:46.377 --> 01:53:48.079]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:53:48.079 --> 01:53:49.800]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:53.663]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[01:53:53.663 --> 01:53:55.225]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:53:55.225 --> 01:53:56.266]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:54:03.496 --> 01:54:04.197]  And we are back.
[01:54:04.197 --> 01:54:06.399]  We're going to take some of your phone calls in the next hour.
[01:54:06.399 --> 01:54:07.380]  Joel Schaus was our guest.
[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:08.841]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:54:08.841 --> 01:54:14.246]  We are having to end all those big specials where we had like 40 to 30 to 20 percent off on everything.
[01:54:14.246 --> 01:54:15.868]  We had to end that super sale.
[01:54:15.868 --> 01:54:17.890]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:54:18.650 --> 01:54:26.372]  The revenue that comes in obviously funds this independent operation, plus you get great products at very, very affordable prices, and sometimes the very best prices out there.
[01:54:26.372 --> 01:54:28.773]  But it is a moral choice.
[01:54:28.773 --> 01:54:35.894]  You're funding us with your free association, with your free will, and what's left of the free market, and I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:54:35.894 --> 01:54:38.435]  But I am extending the sale on three items.
[01:54:38.435 --> 01:54:40.555]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Fruit Punch Drink.
[01:54:40.555 --> 01:54:42.416]  It's great for yourself, your kids, you name it.
[01:54:42.836 --> 01:54:43.597]  We're good to go.
[01:55:02.712 --> 01:55:03.153]  I don't know.
[01:55:22.918 --> 01:55:25.118]  Invaluable information to be prepared.
[01:55:25.118 --> 01:55:27.379]  He's like the top guy out there on most subjects.
[01:55:27.379 --> 01:55:28.659]  Undoubtedly.
[01:55:28.659 --> 01:55:31.119]  I guess you could say indisputably.
[01:55:31.119 --> 01:55:34.200]  A lot of folks say he's about the best there is.
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:51.063]  But getting back with Joel Skousen here, we've got the Washington Post, everybody, as I said earlier, with headlines like, as globalism is in deep trouble, G20 doubles down, and all these admissions of world government in deep trouble because of nationalism, the Brexit, all of it.
[01:55:53.288 --> 01:55:55.890]  They always wanted to have this world government project in the dark.
[01:55:55.890 --> 01:56:03.617]  Now, because of you and many others, and Donald Trump, we're having a real debate.
[01:56:03.617 --> 01:56:11.783]  I don't see how they can succeed long-term as more and more people understand the Federal Reserve's private, as more and more people understand the conspiracy, Joel.
[01:56:11.783 --> 01:56:16.507]  So, in your gut, I mean, what do you see happening if Hillary gets in versus a Trump?
[01:56:16.507 --> 01:56:21.992]  Just in the few minutes we have in this short segment, what's the big picture for Team Humanity against Team Technocrat?
[01:56:23.666 --> 01:56:32.611]  Well, there's a massive uprising against globalism worldwide, or especially in Europe and the United States, and Donald Trump has tapped into that in a popular sense.
[01:56:32.611 --> 01:56:37.734]  He's not only going to, you know, swore that he will not sign the TPP or the TTIP,
[01:56:39.716 --> 01:56:47.100]  He will undo NAFTA, GATT, and World Trade Organization and start to do individual treaties with individual countries.
[01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:53.303]  So this is a real strong position that I don't think he can ever back down on.
[01:56:53.303 --> 01:56:57.665]  So that's one of the reasons why I think the globalists cannot afford to let Donald Trump... That's the big one, isn't it?
[01:56:57.665 --> 01:56:58.246]  That's the big one.
[01:56:58.726 --> 01:56:59.987]  That's the big one.
[01:56:59.987 --> 01:57:12.816]  I mean, the borders thing is also a big one because this is a major conflict creation agenda and to water down conservative voting power in both Europe and the United States if you water it down with unlimited immigration.
[01:57:12.816 --> 01:57:13.716]  This is the big thing.
[01:57:14.637 --> 01:57:18.439]  That Hillary will, in fact, just swamp us.
[01:57:18.439 --> 01:57:21.520]  Within a hundred days, she's going to have massive amnesty.
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:31.524]  She's going to continue everything that, you know, Donald Trump is against, and including more Muslim refugees that will double or triple coming into the United States.
[01:57:31.524 --> 01:57:36.066]  This is going to be a massive problem that, as you know, Alex, will never be undone.
[01:57:36.066 --> 01:57:38.367]  Once these people get here, they will never be shipped back.
[01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:40.900]  The illegals will never be shipped.
[01:57:40.900 --> 01:57:55.964]  Now, I personally do believe in self-deportation, meaning that if you start to enforce deportation and you strip people of other things to pay for other things, there's a massive incentive to get back to Mexico before you get forcibly deported.
[01:57:55.964 --> 01:58:01.805]  And so, I think this whole thing about you just can't deport 11 million people is just baloney.
[01:58:01.805 --> 01:58:03.766]  You can if you start to enforce the law.
[01:58:04.435 --> 01:58:13.022]  And I'm not sure that Donald Trump has the right tactics in that ball, but I clearly hit away Clinton.
[01:58:13.022 --> 01:58:19.748]  It's the end of the world for the conservative movement, because first of all, you're going to flood the country with voters who will vote Democratic.
[01:58:19.748 --> 01:58:21.790]  You'll never win another election again.
[01:58:21.790 --> 01:58:23.111]  She'll flood the Supreme Court.
[01:58:23.111 --> 01:58:26.474]  Could be up to three or four replacements during her term.
[01:58:26.974 --> 01:58:28.476]  Stay right there.
[01:58:28.476 --> 01:58:29.117]  Back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:29.117 --> 01:58:31.179]  This is the end of the republic if it happens.
[01:58:31.179 --> 01:58:32.060]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:33.142]  We'll be back.
[01:58:33.142 --> 01:58:33.682]  Stay with us.
[01:58:49.861 --> 01:58:50.682]  Hey, everyone!
[01:58:50.682 --> 01:58:56.806]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:58:56.806 --> 01:58:58.888]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:58:58.888 --> 01:59:09.175]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:59:09.175 --> 01:59:15.160]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:59:15.620 --> 01:59:36.380]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work, you need to check out InfoWarsTeam.com.
[01:59:36.380 --> 01:59:38.362]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition.
[01:59:38.362 --> 01:59:38.742]  Head over to
[01:59:38.882 --> 01:59:39.462]  We're good to go.
[02:00:12.694 --> 02:00:21.180]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:25.543]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:25.543 --> 02:00:29.706]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:00:29.706 --> 02:00:33.908]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.908 --> 02:00:38.672]  Globalists want total social control to carry out
[02:00:41.448 --> 02:00:46.752]  The programming of the public to serve their one world government system.
[02:00:46.752 --> 02:00:49.514]  We're not just being conquered by some more advanced civilization.
[02:00:49.514 --> 02:00:56.379]  We're being conquered by people who are literal servants of evil.
[02:00:56.379 --> 02:00:58.860]  And the rest of us are just caught up in the middle of it.
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:01.082]  It is an epic time to be alive.
[02:01:01.082 --> 02:01:02.063]  Phone calls are coming up.
[02:01:02.063 --> 02:01:03.123]  Joel Skousen is our guest.
[02:01:03.123 --> 02:01:06.126]  I want to get into the next segment, into Russia, the emails and more.
[02:01:06.126 --> 02:01:10.609]  But Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief, you were finishing up with
[02:01:12.130 --> 02:01:17.594]  The fact that what happens if Hillary gets in, please continue and then briefly, what happens if Trump gets in?
[02:01:17.594 --> 02:01:20.676]  It doesn't mean some panacea takes place.
[02:01:20.676 --> 02:01:22.638]  Well, that's right.
[02:01:22.638 --> 02:01:24.980]  If Trump gets in, first of all, you know I'm
[02:01:26.027 --> 02:01:29.591]  Even though I plan on voting for Trump, I'm very worried about some of his positions.
[02:01:29.591 --> 02:01:34.537]  I'm voting for Trump because this is the last election that's going to make a difference in this country, in my opinion.
[02:01:34.537 --> 02:01:36.740]  If Hillary gets in, it's all over for the country.
[02:01:36.740 --> 02:01:38.121]  And by the way, we haven't talked about your pedigree.
[02:01:38.121 --> 02:01:41.545]  I mean, you used to run the major national conservative movement in D.C.
[02:01:41.545 --> 02:01:44.549]  I mean, you've been a bigwig and all that, and you've been at the highest levels.
[02:01:45.543 --> 02:01:46.023]  That's right.
[02:01:46.023 --> 02:01:52.785]  I was the chairman of the Conservative National Committee during the Reagan administration, and that's when Dinesh D'Souza started out.
[02:01:52.785 --> 02:01:58.707]  He was a young guy coming in from India and got swallowed up by the establishment.
[02:01:58.707 --> 02:02:01.488]  It won't touch conspiracy.
[02:02:01.488 --> 02:02:10.491]  He does some good work in terms of exposing Obama and Hillary, but, you know, he puts out the message that if he would just get rid of these two people, that we're good to go, and that's just not true.
[02:02:11.414 --> 02:02:15.975]  We're fighting a massive conspiracy of power that controls both political parties.
[02:02:15.975 --> 02:02:18.395]  And that's what happens if Hillary gets back in.
[02:02:18.395 --> 02:02:19.656]  They're fully back in control.
[02:02:19.656 --> 02:02:24.197]  But here's something that they want other than just winning with Hillary.
[02:02:24.197 --> 02:02:27.717]  What they want to do is defeat Trump soundly.
[02:02:27.717 --> 02:02:32.238]  They want to embarrass the entire anti-establishment movement.
[02:02:32.238 --> 02:02:35.859]  So they might steal it by a huge number and just say, see you're repudiated.
[02:02:36.599 --> 02:02:38.520]  They want to repudiate it so bad.
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:40.320]  It's just like Brexit.
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:47.403]  Theresa May is going to sabotage the breakfast so badly that people will just forever regret having voted for breakfast.
[02:02:47.403 --> 02:02:48.403]  And that's what they want to do.
[02:02:48.403 --> 02:02:51.424]  By the way, I talked to Farage, you know, on record and off record.
[02:02:51.424 --> 02:02:54.145]  I had dinner with him and he said, he seemed pretty freaked out.
[02:02:54.145 --> 02:02:58.486]  He said, we had to do the right thing, but they're really trying to wreck the country now and sabotage.
[02:02:58.486 --> 02:03:03.528]  I hope folks understand, you know, that, you know, and then we don't get into them, but they're pulling out all the stops now.
[02:03:04.434 --> 02:03:04.914]  That's right.
[02:03:04.914 --> 02:03:11.676]  And they're going to pull out all the stops to defeat Trump big, in my opinion, because what this does is crush the anti-establishment movement.
[02:03:11.676 --> 02:03:20.018]  And, you know, Paul Ryan can come out and Mitt Romney will come and say, you see, this is what happens when you guys go off the rails and support somebody like Donald Trump.
[02:03:20.018 --> 02:03:21.599]  You know, this is a dead end.
[02:03:21.599 --> 02:03:24.880]  We're going to lose the whole Republican Party because of you people.
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:29.641]  And there's a whole bunch of people who will be susceptible to that and come back to the mainstream.
[02:03:29.641 --> 02:03:30.661]  That's what they hope.
[02:03:30.661 --> 02:03:32.262]  It'll be self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:03:32.842 --> 02:03:34.483]  Yes, exactly.
[02:03:34.483 --> 02:03:36.905]  And so that's the biggest fear that I have.
[02:03:36.905 --> 02:03:38.026]  How do we counter that then?
[02:03:38.026 --> 02:03:44.891]  I mean, just landslide, exit polls, get Trump out front saying she stole the nomination?
[02:03:44.891 --> 02:03:51.437]  Well, you know, you have to counter it by having a leader that's got the kind of strength that Trump puts out.
[02:03:51.437 --> 02:03:58.922]  I mean, frankly, you're not going to convince the mainstream, the main body of the 30%, maybe 20% of that, I'm sorry,
[02:04:01.784 --> 02:04:07.226]  80% of that 30% is going to stay true to the anti-establishment and not going to ever go back to the other thing.
[02:04:07.226 --> 02:04:08.407]  But they need a leader.
[02:04:08.407 --> 02:04:13.848]  They need a Ron Paul, somebody who will be solid and stable and very carefully spoken.
[02:04:13.848 --> 02:04:17.610]  That's the danger of Donald Trump as he's captured the movement.
[02:04:17.610 --> 02:04:23.732]  And he's said many right things, but when you support terror, when you support torture,
[02:04:24.867 --> 02:04:35.238]  It's just almost unfathomable and other things and the war on ISIS in the sense of, you know... I think that's him trying to go with the honesty and the brazenness because he knows it's already going on.
[02:04:35.238 --> 02:04:36.919]  I have a problem with that as well.
[02:04:36.919 --> 02:04:39.362]  But in a sick way, it's refreshing that he's just being honest about it.
[02:04:40.697 --> 02:04:55.476]  Yeah, the problem is it works into the support the military at any cost, you know, and as I said in this week's World Affairs Brief, the problem of both parties out there praising and praising the military and police power is that it leads to a neocon agenda.
[02:04:55.476 --> 02:04:56.858]  It leads to continued intervention.
[02:04:56.858 --> 02:04:58.199]  Explain it all on the other side.
[02:04:59.060 --> 02:05:00.762]  Interesting information with Joel Scott.
[02:05:16.854 --> 02:05:23.337]  Clinton said, quote, I don't hold any ill feeling for someone who in that moment may not fully recall everything that was or wasn't said.
[02:05:23.337 --> 02:05:32.262]  Now that's a bold statement coming from Hillary's mouth, considering the FBI revealed she lied numerous times about sending classified information over her unsecured private email server.
[02:05:32.262 --> 02:05:43.228]  Hillary's suggesting, once again, that families of the Benghazi victims didn't hear her properly when she told them the cause of the attack was an anti-Muslim YouTube video, that it was not a coordinated pre-planned terror attack.
[02:05:43.228 --> 02:05:45.589]  But private emails revealed Hillary knows the terrorist attack.
[02:05:45.789 --> 02:05:54.957]  And additionally, the whole story about the YouTube video was a State Department fabrication to cover up the Department's role in shipping living weapons to jihadists in Syria via Benghazi.

[02:08:06.073 --> 02:08:10.035]  Elijah was a wooden Indian standing by the door.
[02:08:10.035 --> 02:08:14.437]  He fell in love with an Indian made over in the antique store.
[02:08:14.437 --> 02:08:18.679]  Elijah!
[02:08:18.679 --> 02:08:23.001]  Just stood there and never let it show.
[02:08:23.001 --> 02:08:25.582]  So she could never answer yes or no.
[02:08:29.783 --> 02:08:35.268]  The phone calls are coming up.
[02:08:35.268 --> 02:08:39.712]  Organic Warrior and James and Milton and Phil and Jeff and others.

[02:08:43.215 --> 02:08:45.216]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:08:45.216 --> 02:08:46.718]  There's a story Roger Stone just sent over.
[02:08:46.718 --> 02:08:47.779]  We're going to post the whole thing.
[02:08:47.779 --> 02:08:48.719]  It's at the Hill.
[02:08:48.719 --> 02:08:51.182]  Putin's Big Trump Gamble.
[02:08:51.182 --> 02:08:52.302]  And it goes into what Putin said.
[02:08:52.302 --> 02:08:53.624]  Hillary's a liar.
[02:08:53.624 --> 02:08:54.905]  She's got troops on their border.
[02:08:56.164 --> 02:08:58.685]  And they're going to start leaking more, more emails.
[02:08:58.685 --> 02:09:01.826]  Again, all these governments have Hillary's emails.
[02:09:01.826 --> 02:09:06.028]  The bigger question is, why would Hillary put all this stuff on a server she knows penetrated?
[02:09:06.028 --> 02:09:09.149]  Was it a more sophisticated program of, like, putting this info out?
[02:09:09.149 --> 02:09:10.889]  Was it a Dropbox where she was getting paid?
[02:09:10.889 --> 02:09:14.111]  We know she was paid by foreign governments, but was it for this?
[02:09:14.111 --> 02:09:15.131]  Or does she just not care?
[02:09:15.131 --> 02:09:18.672]  Because these people really are reckless.
[02:09:18.672 --> 02:09:20.333]  They're on huge power trips.
[02:09:20.333 --> 02:09:22.094]  Let me ask you that question.
[02:09:22.094 --> 02:09:22.494]  Obviously,
[02:09:23.573 --> 02:09:25.654]  I don't put Putin up on some pedestal, you don't either.
[02:09:25.654 --> 02:09:33.219]  All these big power structures are filled with predatory groups.
[02:09:33.219 --> 02:09:39.562]  But what do you make with the situation where Brexit and Nigel Farage and UKIP don't want to have war with Russia?
[02:09:39.562 --> 02:09:41.563]  That just seems like common sense to me.
[02:09:41.563 --> 02:09:44.465]  You've got Trump not pushing that.
[02:09:44.465 --> 02:09:46.126]  You've got, I mean myself, I'm not for that.
[02:09:46.126 --> 02:09:48.788]  It seems like common sense and there's almost a nostalgia.
[02:09:49.636 --> 02:09:49.956]  I think so.
[02:10:04.776 --> 02:10:08.018]  Spectrum of pieces.
[02:10:08.018 --> 02:10:10.360]  And who do you think is involved in these hacks?
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:14.222]  Because I've talked to a lot of folks that are smart and they say, no doubt it's the Russians.
[02:10:14.222 --> 02:10:15.103]  I mean, I think that's clear.
[02:10:15.103 --> 02:10:19.245]  A lot of these hacks are Russians, but it's other governments that are penetrating these as well.
[02:10:19.245 --> 02:10:21.347]  So what do you make of all this, Joel Skousen?
[02:10:22.659 --> 02:10:32.186]  We have to remember that the whole reason for Hillary putting her emails on private servers was because of her own corruption and her own illegal activities.
[02:10:32.186 --> 02:10:33.647]  Selling influence, basically.
[02:10:33.647 --> 02:10:38.290]  Like the head of the EPA had her own gnome to plume and fakes, you know, separate server.
[02:10:38.290 --> 02:10:39.151]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:10:39.151 --> 02:10:40.231]  And it was to cover her.
[02:10:40.231 --> 02:10:44.014]  So she really didn't care about the national security aspects of things.
[02:10:44.014 --> 02:10:45.295]  She had to protect her own.
[02:10:45.695 --> 02:10:48.496]  And that's why she made disappear so many of those emails.
[02:10:48.496 --> 02:10:51.436]  And those emails are in the hands of the NSA.
[02:10:51.436 --> 02:10:53.337]  Look, they've got everything.
[02:10:53.337 --> 02:10:54.917]  So they know exactly what Hillary's doing.
[02:10:54.917 --> 02:11:03.639]  And the reason why the FBI isn't prosecuting, the NSA isn't revealing that is because, I mean, this is part of the system of immunity.
[02:11:03.639 --> 02:11:07.640]  The people who play games with the globalist conspiracy are given protection.
[02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:11.805]  Now, Putin has to be kind of careful.
[02:11:11.805 --> 02:11:20.896]  The reason why he isn't revealing these things, except perhaps through WikiLeaks, he can pass those on to Assange and WikiLeaks, is because he doesn't want to let the U.S.
[02:11:20.896 --> 02:11:25.522]  and NSA know what his capabilities are in terms of spying on Americans.
[02:11:26.423 --> 02:11:30.367]  Which I think are considerable, but I don't think they're anywhere near what the NSA.
[02:11:30.367 --> 02:11:39.015]  Because remember, the NSA has actual physical taps into email servers from AT&T and Verizon.
[02:11:39.015 --> 02:11:41.737]  Beyond that, they've got backdoor chips all built in.
[02:11:41.737 --> 02:11:42.979]  It's way beyond that.
[02:11:43.601 --> 02:11:45.523]  That's right, and the Russians don't have that.
[02:11:45.523 --> 02:11:51.968]  They don't have the same access to our infrastructure and to those private companies that our NSA does.
[02:11:51.968 --> 02:12:10.183]  And so I don't think that the... If the Russians have anything, they're trying to tap into government servers so they can see what the government is collecting by tapping into government, and that's where they're... But the government's very much aware... Or they're targeting lazy staffers that take the material illegally off those government servers.
[02:12:10.902 --> 02:12:12.283]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:12:12.283 --> 02:12:21.249]  So I don't think the Russian threat in terms of surveillance, threat or ability to do cyber things is anywhere near what our... No, no, I agree, but what about the political import?
[02:12:21.249 --> 02:12:22.709]  What about the relationship?
[02:12:22.709 --> 02:12:25.751]  What about this situation between Putin and Trump?
[02:12:25.751 --> 02:12:26.432]  What do you make of that?
[02:12:27.930 --> 02:12:35.454]  Well, first of all, I don't think there's... Trump doesn't have as much influence in Russia as it has been reported, as he has.
[02:12:35.454 --> 02:12:42.877]  Sure, he has some business ties and has tried to make inroads into Moscow in terms of hotels and other types of things.
[02:12:42.877 --> 02:12:47.460]  But just like, you know, the stories that have come out about his mafia, Trump's mafia connections.
[02:12:47.460 --> 02:12:53.983]  I mean, look, you can't build a hotel in New York without dealing with mafia-controlled labor unions and mafia-controlled companies.
[02:12:54.543 --> 02:13:01.927]  You can't build a casino in Atlantic City or Las Vegas without dealing with mafia-controlled companies and unions.
[02:13:01.927 --> 02:13:11.613]  So I don't think Putin, or I don't think Trump has any mafioso-type connections in the sense of an evil type of thing.
[02:13:11.613 --> 02:13:15.275]  I think he just made a pragmatic business decision.
[02:13:15.275 --> 02:13:16.356]  I totally agree with you.
[02:13:16.356 --> 02:13:17.577]  That's what the evidence shows.
[02:13:17.577 --> 02:13:21.159]  But what about, what do you think the Anglo-American establishment thinks of this?
[02:13:23.808 --> 02:13:25.376]  Of what, Trump?
[02:13:25.376 --> 02:13:28.209]  Of Russia trying to help bring down Hillary Clinton.
[02:13:31.482 --> 02:13:41.849]  Well, you know, Russia has had a great deal of success in fighting the globalist agenda in Syria and sticking it in the face of the globalists and saying, look, we're not going to let you take down Assad.
[02:13:41.849 --> 02:13:44.331]  I mean, this surprised everyone, including myself.
[02:13:44.331 --> 02:13:52.576]  I didn't see it coming because Putin didn't lift a finger to help Assad until all of a sudden he changed modes and decided to do so.
[02:13:52.576 --> 02:14:01.062]  And that's why Paul Craig Roberts and other people are applauding Putin is because he seems to be the hero on the white horse that is attacking globalists.
[02:14:02.683 --> 02:14:23.520]  So this leads us to the bigger question in terms of the big propaganda out there from the anti-globalists on our side, even on the right, like Paul Craig Roberts, is that Putin is the good guy, and the U.S., the globalists are the bad guys, and they're going to start a war with Russia, and that's what all these troops on the border with Russia, and that's why the troops coming into the Baltics and the
[02:14:25.424 --> 02:14:29.066]  Big war exercises are all meant to start a war with Russia.
[02:14:29.066 --> 02:14:32.047]  In fact, even the Russians think that the U.S.
[02:14:32.047 --> 02:14:36.428]  is going to provoke a war with them sooner rather than later, and I think they're wrong.
[02:14:36.428 --> 02:14:42.611]  My view is that the globalists are doing very soft provocations.
[02:14:42.611 --> 02:14:47.473]  I mean, the Russians know that these future thousands of troops, even tens and twenties... Sure.
[02:14:47.473 --> 02:14:50.454]  Are you saying they're doing it to, like, scan the defenses and war game?
[02:14:51.423 --> 02:14:59.448]  Not only that, they're doing it to help Putin build his rapport with the Russian people and build the image of the U.S.
[02:14:59.448 --> 02:15:01.089]  and NATO as aggressors.
[02:15:01.089 --> 02:15:07.233]  Now, as Russia needs this to get the Russian people on his side to eventually attack the West, and so does China.
[02:15:07.233 --> 02:15:16.999]  And that fits in with Hillary, is actually the one on record, Wall Street Journal, that is actually arming Russia and giving them the uranium everything.
[02:15:16.999 --> 02:15:19.381]  That shows that larger, high-level globalist agenda.
[02:15:20.021 --> 02:15:21.082]  That's exactly right.
[02:15:21.082 --> 02:15:24.604]  I mean, Clinton didn't actually produce this uranium deal.
[02:15:24.604 --> 02:15:26.826]  This was a globalist deal to help.
[02:15:26.826 --> 02:15:33.250]  I mean, the globalists have been trying to help build Russian and Chinese military technology for years.
[02:15:33.250 --> 02:15:38.994]  And to fund them, even when the phony fall of the Soviet Union, they were sending suitcases full of $100 bills over to the Kremlin.
[02:15:38.994 --> 02:15:44.057]  And that's why the new oligarchs in Russia only had $100 bills when they went to Europe.
[02:15:44.057 --> 02:15:45.598]  That's why they could only give $100 bill tips.
[02:15:47.199 --> 02:15:53.163]  They didn't have anything but $100 bills because of the Fed helping out the phony fall of the Soviet Union.
[02:15:53.163 --> 02:15:56.064]  So they've been involved in this and so it's so hypocritical.
[02:15:56.064 --> 02:15:57.245]  But isn't there a lot of evidence?
[02:15:57.245 --> 02:16:02.168]  I mean, I know there's stay-behind networks and major influence to the West and the Anglo-American establishment penetrating Russia.
[02:16:02.168 --> 02:16:08.552]  Putin's been cutting that off, kicking a lot of those people out, the Soros groups, the State Department people, the Voice of America people.
[02:16:08.552 --> 02:16:09.953]  I mean, it seems like Russia is
[02:16:10.633 --> 02:16:12.135]  They keep arresting oligarchs.
[02:16:12.135 --> 02:16:14.037]  It turns out they're always Rothschild fronts.
[02:16:14.037 --> 02:16:15.259]  There's been lawsuits over this.
[02:16:15.259 --> 02:16:21.706]  I mean, it seems like, I understand before, there were state-behind networks and a lot of it was staged in Perestroika.
[02:16:21.706 --> 02:16:26.512]  But it looks like that kind of got double-crossed once Yeltsin was gone and in came Putin.
[02:16:27.844 --> 02:16:29.146]  There was a double-cross.
[02:16:29.146 --> 02:16:35.695]  In other words, the oligarchs were the original communist leaders under the table.
[02:16:35.695 --> 02:16:38.559]  They were the ones controlling the Politburo, which were frontmen.
[02:16:38.559 --> 02:16:42.064]  I mean, like Gorbachev was in the... Yeah, the same crew came in in 1917, yeah.
[02:16:42.064 --> 02:16:43.045]  That's right, that's right.
[02:16:43.826 --> 02:16:53.853]  The point is, Putin staged a coup against the old oligarchs and had Boris Berezovsky killed and Gusinsky exiled to Israel and other places.
[02:16:53.853 --> 02:17:01.999]  So the original oligarchs were running the Soviet Union behind the scenes, got ousted, and Putin now has a new backing of oligarchs.
[02:17:01.999 --> 02:17:10.405]  But let me be clear, no single man runs any of these major conspiracies, whether it's China or whether or not... I understand, they're all penetrating each other.
[02:17:10.965 --> 02:17:21.014]  There's a powerful group behind and even though the Rothschilds have tried to make inroads into the banking system, most of this was for influence and spying and for facilitating
[02:17:22.346 --> 02:17:25.169]  Sure, so let's expand on that.
[02:17:25.169 --> 02:17:41.423]  Clearly Soros and others are launching assaults on Russia, but you're saying that's part of a false battlefront to actually lure them in to a false war paradigm, not for the larger, more advanced technology response attack.
[02:17:42.796 --> 02:17:43.476]  That's right.
[02:17:43.476 --> 02:17:50.259]  And it also was to produce all of the oil technology and the oil aid that produced, made Russia a major oil producer.
[02:17:50.259 --> 02:17:53.220]  All that was Western oil technology that went into Russia.
[02:17:53.220 --> 02:17:55.301]  And Soros helped finance that and things.
[02:17:55.301 --> 02:17:58.722]  And the Rothschild banks helped finance some of these oligarchs.
[02:17:58.722 --> 02:18:05.384]  But if Putin snatched it back from them, then that would mean that a lot of this is, I mean, all I'm saying, the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[02:18:05.384 --> 02:18:06.865]  I mean, they didn't want Brexit.
[02:18:06.865 --> 02:18:08.585]  They didn't want Russia to come into Syria.
[02:18:08.585 --> 02:18:10.306]  I mean, quite frankly,
[02:18:12.492 --> 02:18:24.057]  I mean, I'm not here tooting my horn, but I was told 10 years ago by RT people here and then by the head of RT that, you know, that Russia actually was aware of the New World Order, what was going on, and then blah, blah, blah, and Vladimir Putin, you know, liked what I was doing.
[02:18:24.057 --> 02:18:25.618]  I'm like, that's insane, that's crazy.
[02:18:25.618 --> 02:18:34.681]  You know, then you get told that by people about Donald Trump a year and a half ago, and then you're sitting there talking to Donald Trump, and I'm just going to leave it there, and you realize, wow, we do have that influence, and I'm going to skip this network break because this is so important.
[02:18:34.681 --> 02:18:39.263]  Not bragging about Infowars, but Joel, we really do reach 28 million people conservatively a week.
[02:18:39.263 --> 02:18:40.724]  A lot of those are new people every week.
[02:18:41.084 --> 02:18:43.545]  That's about on average what comes through a week.
[02:18:43.545 --> 02:18:44.786]  We're growing exponentially.
[02:18:44.786 --> 02:18:48.368]  In fact, that's an old number, 28 million.
[02:18:48.368 --> 02:18:49.489]  It's not that we're even that good.
[02:18:49.489 --> 02:18:55.292]  Most people just never read the books, the research, experienced it like you and I and others have done.
[02:18:55.292 --> 02:18:57.313]  You've been doing this a lot longer than I have.
[02:18:57.313 --> 02:19:00.535]  I mean, our version of reality is a lot closer to the false one.
[02:19:01.435 --> 02:19:09.257]  And so it's just crazy to know, it comes out the Syrian emails that Assad's reading InfoWars and telling his people, this is the truth, go with this.
[02:19:09.257 --> 02:19:10.798]  That's in London Telegraph.
[02:19:10.798 --> 02:19:18.820]  You got Putin, you got all these guys they put on Russian TV that mainstream news say is like an Alex Jones version, you know, and like that's Putin's best buddy.
[02:19:18.820 --> 02:19:22.761]  You've got, I had dinner with Nigel Farage, they've been huge listeners forever.
[02:19:22.761 --> 02:19:24.862]  He said most people when he goes and knocks on the door,
[02:19:25.342 --> 02:19:31.811]  This is like 15 years ago where my listeners, he said, you woke, he said this on air before, most people up in England for me to do this.
[02:19:31.811 --> 02:19:33.494]  I'm not bragging about what I've done.
[02:19:33.494 --> 02:19:37.079]  I've taken all the great research and the work of so many others like your uncle, yourself.
[02:19:37.079 --> 02:19:41.546]  I've done my own research as well and countless others and with Drudge's help and others and my listeners.
[02:19:43.250 --> 02:19:44.371]  I'm not selfishly.
[02:19:44.371 --> 02:19:46.793]  I'm actually the point where normally I can handle being big.
[02:19:46.793 --> 02:19:47.974]  I can handle stuff.
[02:19:47.974 --> 02:19:49.355]  I'm not on a power trip.
[02:19:49.355 --> 02:19:54.879]  It's getting to really weird levels now where, you know, I can't get into it on air, but I mean, it's getting weird.
[02:19:54.879 --> 02:19:57.721]  And they've already tried to buy me out before.
[02:19:57.721 --> 02:19:58.561]  That didn't work.
[02:19:58.561 --> 02:20:01.163]  And I just I really feel like I'm in, you know, I mean, I'm really worried.
[02:20:01.163 --> 02:20:04.446]  I've been praying a lot because, man, there's no doubt now.
[02:20:04.446 --> 02:20:06.667]  Infowars is the tip of the spear.
[02:20:06.667 --> 02:20:08.268]  And I'm just an average guy, Joel.
[02:20:08.268 --> 02:20:10.590]  So you're a wise person.
[02:20:10.590 --> 02:20:11.591]  What do you think about what I just said?
[02:20:12.421 --> 02:20:13.402]  Well, I agree.
[02:20:13.402 --> 02:20:21.874]  In fact, we are at an apex of influence right now that probably means that they've got to do something to break this all down.
[02:20:21.874 --> 02:20:24.017]  One of those is going to be to destroy Brexit.
[02:20:24.017 --> 02:20:30.005]  The other thing is going to be to destroy Donald Trump, have a backlash to try to discredit this movement.
[02:20:30.605 --> 02:20:32.666]  I don't think it's going to go away.
[02:20:32.666 --> 02:20:42.309]  But one thing I realize, even though, as you say, the Russians are listening and they're watching, I don't think they believe me personally that they're being set up for a trap.
[02:20:42.309 --> 02:20:45.850]  Even if they did, Alex, it's in their DNA.
[02:20:45.850 --> 02:20:47.731]  They've got to take down the West.
[02:20:47.731 --> 02:20:49.872]  They cannot stop this trajectory.
[02:20:50.805 --> 02:20:54.066]  In other words, they have to figure out a way around the trap.
[02:20:54.066 --> 02:20:55.967]  They can't stop and not attack.
[02:20:55.967 --> 02:21:03.689]  And so, if Paul Kruger Roberts is wrong about Putin being benign and that he doesn't ever have to attack the West, they will.
[02:21:03.689 --> 02:21:06.330]  But generally in history, the Russians don't attack, they get attacked.
[02:21:08.061 --> 02:21:08.501]  No, no.
[02:21:08.501 --> 02:21:10.843]  Remember, in Hitler, they were planning an attack.
[02:21:10.843 --> 02:21:12.124]  They had a massive... They were.
[02:21:12.124 --> 02:21:13.986]  That's why Hitler launched Barbarossa.
[02:21:13.986 --> 02:21:15.047]  That's exactly why.
[02:21:15.047 --> 02:21:16.368]  They were going to attack Hitler.
[02:21:16.368 --> 02:21:18.029]  So, it's in their DNA.
[02:21:18.029 --> 02:21:21.452]  They are going to take down the West, but it's in a more sophisticated way.
[02:21:21.452 --> 02:21:27.217]  They want to strike the military and blackmail the West into submission, in my opinion.
[02:21:27.737 --> 02:21:31.238]  They don't want to hit nuclear cities even though China has threatened that.
[02:21:31.238 --> 02:21:36.320]  When you say DNA though, I would say the West has been more expansionist generally in history than the Russians.
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:45.283]  And obviously it's a complex history, but when you say in the DNA, I mean really it seems like the cosmology is we're always getting attacked and picked on and we're not going to put up with it.
[02:21:45.283 --> 02:21:48.184]  I mean, is that why you're saying it's in the DNA or explain that psychology?
[02:21:49.045 --> 02:21:56.332]  No, I'm saying it's part of the three predator centers that I've preached for many years, Russia, China, and the Anglo-American globalists.
[02:21:56.332 --> 02:22:03.238]  I think they're all three satanic-based conspiracies against man, God, and liberty.
[02:22:03.238 --> 02:22:08.563]  And that's what I mean by their DNA, is they're taking their orders from a dark spiritual spectrum.
[02:22:09.444 --> 02:22:13.489]  Uh, in opposite to God, and they cannot stop from attacking the West.
[02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:31.801]  It's not really real.
[02:22:31.801 --> 02:22:34.343]  It's a very good propaganda show.
[02:22:34.343 --> 02:22:35.864]  Putin is very, very smart.
[02:22:35.864 --> 02:22:40.067]  He knows how to play this globalist, anti-globalist agenda.
[02:22:40.067 --> 02:22:42.349]  He knows how to play against the GMOs.
[02:22:42.349 --> 02:22:50.916]  I mean, he knows that Monsanto is part of this globalism, and so is the medical establishment and all that, and so he's taking the opposite positions.
[02:22:50.916 --> 02:22:58.682]  But believe me, the Soviet Union has never, ever done anything but promote their own orthodoxy, and they will go back to that mantra.
[02:22:59.322 --> 02:23:09.427]  If they get power again, but they're playing a very careful game now of trying to keep enough liberty in Russia to keep people in favor of Putin, but still controlling the agenda.
[02:23:09.427 --> 02:23:17.310]  So I think it's a carefully crafted propaganda to do this, you know, pro-religion stuff.
[02:23:17.310 --> 02:23:23.493]  But you know, they just shut down, for example, the Mormon missionaries and all of the Baptist missionaries and the Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia.
[02:23:23.493 --> 02:23:27.375]  Made it illegal for them to teach anything about religion in people's homes.
[02:23:27.935 --> 02:23:28.981]  We'll show you.
[02:23:28.981 --> 02:23:32.237]  You know the argument is that they're saying they're putting CIA spies into those.
[02:23:33.018 --> 02:23:34.739]  Well, this has always been the thing.
[02:23:34.739 --> 02:23:38.901]  Missionaries all have been claimed that they're CIA spies, and it's just laughable.
[02:23:38.901 --> 02:23:46.224]  I mean, they may be yes-men to government and to the FBI and CIA, but they're not CIA spies.
[02:23:46.224 --> 02:23:48.185]  But, you know, that goes around.
[02:23:48.185 --> 02:23:54.008]  But nevertheless, what I'm saying is that Putin isn't opening up Russia for religious freedom.
[02:23:54.008 --> 02:23:57.969]  He's shutting it down, and that's the mantra that will eventually come back.
[02:23:57.969 --> 02:23:58.190]  Sure.
[02:23:59.230 --> 02:24:00.311]  All I'm doing is wargaming this.
[02:24:00.311 --> 02:24:02.032]  I'm not disagreeing with you.
[02:24:02.032 --> 02:24:07.675]  My issue is Western pressure on the borders is what's causing Russia to get it.
[02:24:07.675 --> 02:24:15.500]  And I understand you're saying they're doing that so that Russia will go into that posture and the globalists then play the different regions off against each other.
[02:24:15.500 --> 02:24:22.705]  And have an excuse to go to that posture with their own people and that's exactly what Putin's riding all the way to rearmament.
[02:24:22.705 --> 02:24:24.766]  Well I know this separately.
[02:24:24.766 --> 02:24:27.247]  The economy here is falling apart.
[02:24:27.247 --> 02:24:27.728]  They say it's a
[02:24:28.703 --> 02:24:29.644]  Point eight growth rate.
[02:24:29.644 --> 02:24:31.707]  We all know it's a negative growth rate.
[02:24:31.707 --> 02:24:35.111]  They admit, you know, it's the worst recovery in our history in the last seven years.
[02:24:35.111 --> 02:24:41.279]  There's all this economic news coming out that the economy is really in shambles.
[02:24:41.279 --> 02:24:42.121]  What do you make of this?
[02:24:42.121 --> 02:24:44.484]  What do you think the state of the world economy really is, Joel Skousen?
[02:24:45.270 --> 02:24:46.711]  Well, I think it is.
[02:24:46.711 --> 02:24:48.352]  The numbers are indisputable.
[02:24:48.352 --> 02:24:49.292]  They're going down.
[02:24:49.292 --> 02:24:51.513]  It doesn't mean they'll ever free fall into collapse.
[02:24:51.513 --> 02:24:55.435]  I don't believe that collapse ever comes without war.
[02:24:55.435 --> 02:25:04.299]  Because as long as people can hustle and make a deal in a declining economy, they'll just continue to make deals and people will still become wealthy.
[02:25:04.299 --> 02:25:11.203]  It's only when people cannot go to work, there is social unrest that comes from war that you have an economic collapse.
[02:25:12.063 --> 02:25:18.508]  I just, you know, people have been preaching economic collapse in terms of Gerald Salendi, in other words, since 2012, and it hasn't happened.
[02:25:18.508 --> 02:25:28.716]  And the reason it hasn't happened is that, you know, the Fed can do this moderate inflation, keeping the real rate of inflation below 10%, and people can adjust for that.
[02:25:28.976 --> 02:25:44.959]  Sure, the economy is so complex, even though it's mainly service, and automation is so powerful, that we have the baubles and symbols of success, and still enough food, and so yes, we never hit a total collapse, unless civil unrest hits, and then that brings in Black Lives Matter.
[02:25:44.959 --> 02:25:45.980]  Is that a beta test?
[02:25:45.980 --> 02:25:57.322]  Is the demographics change for a civil war type crisis, or is it just social engineering to divide and conquer us, so we're not politically unified?
[02:25:58.709 --> 02:26:02.852]  I think it's social engineering and divide and conquer and to justify more police action.
[02:26:02.852 --> 02:26:15.582]  You know, this backlash against police was all government-induced as well, false flag operations, and it was meant to build support for police that were really getting hammered for all of these unjustified, you know, use of force.
[02:26:15.582 --> 02:26:17.324]  And so it's kind of a backlash.
[02:26:17.984 --> 02:26:25.687]  I don't see this ever deteriorating into social unrest to the degree of racial unrest that justifies martial law.
[02:26:25.687 --> 02:26:29.448]  Because martial law really requires hundreds of thousands of troops to shut down everything.
[02:26:29.448 --> 02:26:32.309]  You have roadblocks everywhere and the economy just comes down.
[02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:39.591]  I agree but they have the new soft emergency like France and Germany where they say now you have no political free speech and we just come and arrest you.
[02:26:39.591 --> 02:26:40.932]  This is a soft martial law.
[02:26:41.272 --> 02:26:41.933]  That's right.
[02:26:41.933 --> 02:26:42.453]  That's right.
[02:26:42.453 --> 02:26:43.694]  And that's what happened with the Patriot.
[02:26:43.694 --> 02:26:49.738]  That's what 9-11 was all about, so that you accept all of this diminution of your civil rights.
[02:26:49.738 --> 02:26:54.561]  So I think they're going to keep things together economically, even though there'll be a slow decline.
[02:26:54.561 --> 02:26:55.642]  We've got a long way to go.
[02:26:55.642 --> 02:27:02.927]  There's a lot of wealth, you know, residual wealth within the country that people can live off of, even with 20% real.
[02:27:02.927 --> 02:27:05.088]  I know you always get to this point.
[02:27:05.088 --> 02:27:07.229]  I want to go to break, do a few more minutes, come back and take calls.
[02:27:07.229 --> 02:27:10.351]  I'm going to go to everybody that's patiently holding right away after this break.
[02:27:10.351 --> 02:27:10.972]  Here's a few minutes.
[02:27:11.813 --> 02:27:28.572]  Let's talk about, in the time frame, what five years out, whatever, a nuclear war, how this plays out, and then if the globalists are successful, that they're the dominant group of the predator centers, what they build once that's in place, and then once they finally take down, say, China after that, what do they do once they've got full Luciferian control?
[02:27:29.289 --> 02:27:30.750]  Okay, we'll talk about that.
[02:27:30.750 --> 02:27:32.712]  We've got three minutes to break, let's start talking about it now.
[02:27:32.712 --> 02:27:33.853]  Okay, alright.
[02:27:33.853 --> 02:27:46.985]  So, what I'm saying is that this is the smart way to induce martial law in prison camps and arresting dissidents like you and I, is to wait till war comes, and then another mantra of war saying, you know, we've got a major crisis.
[02:27:46.985 --> 02:27:54.652]  This is what's going to drive them, because they know that Russia and China will attack the military first, and try to blackmail the West into submission.
[02:27:55.413 --> 02:27:59.155]  That's what saves people from actual total destruction of cities.
[02:27:59.155 --> 02:28:05.277]  There will be a preemptive EMP strike preceding that nuclear strike by a few minutes.
[02:28:05.277 --> 02:28:08.919]  And that's what's going to take down the grid and give us social unrest.
[02:28:08.919 --> 02:28:12.240]  You know, even the government will be out of power for a period of time.
[02:28:13.246 --> 02:28:17.449]  They've got, and even policemen aren't going to come to work when their families aren't safe.
[02:28:17.449 --> 02:28:23.234]  So I think when things start to knit back together, I think, and the reason they do knit back together, I think the U.S.
[02:28:23.234 --> 02:28:34.684]  has secret weapons systems, especially space-based anti-missile systems, that can stop any further nuclear attacks while we regroup under a global militarized new world order.
[02:28:34.684 --> 02:28:36.185]  And that's the genius of this system.
[02:28:36.605 --> 02:28:37.587]  If they take down the U.S.
[02:28:37.587 --> 02:28:43.334]  military, they can come out of their bunkers and say, the only way we have to protect us is to join in a militarized war.
[02:28:43.334 --> 02:28:45.557]  And Europe's going to come in and others.
[02:28:45.557 --> 02:28:46.338]  And that's right.
[02:28:46.338 --> 02:28:48.501]  They'll all come together on this.
[02:28:48.501 --> 02:28:52.486]  And I think that the United States will cut a deal with China.
[02:28:53.379 --> 02:29:01.466]  To come in and be half and switch sides and attack Russia's rear and Russia will be taken down in this third world war.
[02:29:01.466 --> 02:29:05.450]  I don't think the Anglo-American globalists will ever be able to take down China.
[02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:06.671]  It's too big.
[02:29:06.671 --> 02:29:11.515]  It will be strengthened during the war because of more aid and trade just like we strengthened the Soviet Union.
[02:29:11.515 --> 02:29:13.077]  We'll already see those deals being made.
[02:29:13.077 --> 02:29:15.339]  So what's the pivot about right now to keep China in line?
[02:29:17.301 --> 02:29:19.502]  Well, remember, China, it's in their DNA.
[02:29:19.502 --> 02:29:20.942]  They're going to attack the West.
[02:29:20.942 --> 02:29:35.688]  And so that's why the mantra is, talk a big stick, send our ships out there to keep international, but don't do anything and continue to invite China into our military exercises so that they can spy on our military.
[02:29:35.688 --> 02:29:37.129]  And that's exactly what they're doing.
[02:29:37.629 --> 02:29:43.016]  The CNO, Chief of Naval Operations, is totally permissive about signing with the Chief of St.
[02:29:43.016 --> 02:29:44.137]  Pat's Fleet.
[02:29:44.137 --> 02:29:46.260]  He's totally permissive about dealing with China.
[02:29:46.260 --> 02:29:48.122]  Stay right there, Joel.
[02:29:48.122 --> 02:29:49.244]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:49.244 --> 02:29:50.625]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.625 --> 02:29:53.168]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.168 --> 02:29:55.832]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.189 --> 02:30:02.871]  What's likely another attempt to downplay Islamic terrorism?
[02:30:02.871 --> 02:30:07.954]  London authorities covered up an attempted car bombing on Saturday night, according to a source who reached out to InfoWars.
[02:30:07.954 --> 02:30:16.480]  Camden Lock, a popular area for club goers, was evacuated by police after a report about a suspicious vehicle at 10.50pm local time, as reported by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:23.745]  Metropolitan Police sent in a bomb robot to check the car and sequentially announced that the vehicle was not deemed too suspicious and officers were stood down.
[02:30:23.945 --> 02:30:31.366]  However, according to an employee who works at one of the venues that was evacuated, he saw information that suggests the incident was in fact an attempted terrorist attack.
[02:30:31.366 --> 02:30:37.167]  The bomb was real, he said, adding that the device contained shrapnel and that the car was filled with gas canisters.
[02:30:37.167 --> 02:30:40.748]  Additionally, the vehicle had no registered owner and no insurance.
[02:30:40.748 --> 02:30:48.529]  The employee also said, quote, the car was parked in a very high traffic area with busy clubs and pubs all around, including a sold out open air event.
[02:30:48.529 --> 02:30:50.870]  If it went off, a lot of people wouldn't have made it home that night.
[02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:52.790]  The mainstream media won't report on it, so maybe
[02:30:53.070 --> 02:30:54.452]  I've been working all day.
[02:30:54.452 --> 02:30:56.113]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[02:30:56.113 --> 02:30:56.954]  I get in here at 830.
[02:31:14.312 --> 02:31:15.633]  I was kind of run down.
[02:31:15.633 --> 02:31:17.573]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[02:31:17.573 --> 02:31:19.454]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[02:31:19.454 --> 02:31:21.275]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[02:31:21.275 --> 02:31:22.335]  I popped two of them.
[02:31:22.335 --> 02:31:24.616]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[02:31:24.616 --> 02:31:26.516]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[02:31:26.516 --> 02:31:28.077]  It's got four and a half stars.
[02:31:28.077 --> 02:31:29.397]  People really love it.
[02:31:29.397 --> 02:31:29.998]  Read about it.
[02:31:29.998 --> 02:31:33.839]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[02:31:33.839 --> 02:31:39.121]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[02:31:39.261 --> 02:31:43.346]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[02:31:43.346 --> 02:31:49.493]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[02:31:49.493 --> 02:31:55.400]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:32:00.091 --> 02:32:01.512]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:32:01.512 --> 02:32:02.852]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:32:02.852 --> 02:32:04.072]  Why is this so good?
[02:32:04.072 --> 02:32:09.354]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:32:09.354 --> 02:32:22.897]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:32:22.897 --> 02:32:24.258]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:32:25.038 --> 02:32:26.679]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:32:26.679 --> 02:32:29.259]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:32:29.259 --> 02:32:30.560]  These are all parasites.
[02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:31.660]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:32:31.660 --> 02:32:33.000]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:37.502]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:32:37.502 --> 02:32:40.783]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:32:40.783 --> 02:32:43.844]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:32:43.844 --> 02:32:44.904]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:32:44.904 --> 02:32:46.825]  LivingDefense, InfowarsLife.com.
[02:32:46.825 --> 02:32:47.845]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:32:47.845 --> 02:32:50.566]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:32:50.566 --> 02:32:50.766]  And, uh,
[02:32:51.426 --> 02:32:52.446]  You support the broadcast.
[02:32:52.446 --> 02:32:53.807]  Infowarslives.com.
[02:32:53.807 --> 02:32:56.048]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:32:56.048 --> 02:33:14.074]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:33:14.074 --> 02:33:18.016]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:31.914 --> 02:33:33.674]  You know, I was sitting around with my children.
[02:33:33.674 --> 02:33:36.675]  We're going to get phone calls here in a moment.
[02:33:36.675 --> 02:33:42.857]  And I was on a tablet pulling up MIT Magazine and other publications.
[02:33:42.857 --> 02:34:01.042]  And I was going online to some research sites and showing them cows that have like ports on their side doors, where they just open them up and then go into their uteruses and insert different chimera humanoid clones and then grow them for harvesting tissue.
[02:34:02.594 --> 02:34:04.855]  And I was sitting there thinking, why am I telling my kids about this?
[02:34:04.855 --> 02:34:10.378]  Because they need to know when they see this in popular culture and things, that they're being conditioned for it.
[02:34:10.378 --> 02:34:22.004]  I mean, I remember I was on air like 18 years ago, and the BBC had an article admitting that they had human animal clones, but that they didn't have any rights.
[02:34:22.004 --> 02:34:24.526]  They weren't growing them up to full size, they were in test tubes.
[02:34:26.061 --> 02:34:28.923]  Because they're not an animal, so there's no laws on that, and they're not a human.
[02:34:28.923 --> 02:34:30.063]  See, it's all these games.
[02:34:30.063 --> 02:34:32.584]  And I've been on air 18 years.
[02:34:32.584 --> 02:34:33.565]  They did it 18 years ago.
[02:34:33.565 --> 02:34:35.646]  It was going on a decade before that.
[02:34:35.646 --> 02:34:37.207]  And now, though, it's in popular culture.
[02:34:37.207 --> 02:34:40.209]  Now they're going, oh, yeah, you can buy glow-in-the-dark cats.
[02:34:40.209 --> 02:34:40.989]  You know, they're $5,000.
[02:34:40.989 --> 02:34:42.110]  They're part jellyfish.
[02:34:42.110 --> 02:34:48.893]  And I'm really just talking about all this geopolitical news with Joel Skousen.
[02:34:48.893 --> 02:34:52.015]  Really, at the end of the day, you've got a crazy elite playing God.
[02:34:53.049 --> 02:34:55.070]  Who believe they're going to merge with machines and become God.
[02:34:55.070 --> 02:35:04.776]  I mean, that's the main worldview, the religious belief, the cosmology of the people at Google and Facebook and Twitter and all the rest of them.
[02:35:04.776 --> 02:35:06.297]  And they really are under a delusion.
[02:35:06.297 --> 02:35:10.439]  They believe that, oh, whatever we do to this Earth, we just use environmentalism to take control.
[02:35:10.439 --> 02:35:12.140]  We're going to remake it and do whatever we want.
[02:35:12.140 --> 02:35:17.163]  We'll have a hundred planets as soon as we become, you know, the singularity and gods.
[02:35:17.163 --> 02:35:19.965]  And, you know, you're lucky we don't just step on you like you're a bug.
[02:35:22.045 --> 02:35:24.966]  And I haven't just read this in magazines when they write this.
[02:35:24.966 --> 02:35:43.110]  I have been invited to parties in Hollywood and Austin before, and then actually sat there and had these people, I'm talking like deputy heads, heads of major companies, just on fire with what I would call demonic energy.
[02:35:43.110 --> 02:35:47.751]  These people are like, ha ha ha, like crazy people, but just animated.
[02:35:47.751 --> 02:35:49.512]  And they're just laughing at me like demons.
[02:35:51.957 --> 02:35:53.798]  You're a fool for not joining us, blah, blah, blah.
[02:35:53.798 --> 02:35:55.259]  And people say, why don't you talk about who their names are?
[02:35:55.259 --> 02:35:57.841]  Well, if you're brought to something off-record, you can't talk about it, obviously.
[02:35:57.841 --> 02:36:01.683]  As a journalist, I'll never be let back into any of these things.
[02:36:01.683 --> 02:36:17.974]  But I can talk about it, because Rothkopf, that one time, in front of John Harmon, eight, nine years ago, the head of the Kissinger Group at the time, was on the show, and going, yeah, I know, we came on, we know who you are, come up to New York, let's hang out, you're a smart guy, you're a part of the superclass, you're the leader of the conspiracy movement, we could do good with you.
[02:36:17.974 --> 02:36:19.455]  And I said, now, this isn't off-record, he goes,
[02:36:20.700 --> 02:36:27.306]  Well, no, but it will be when you come up here and harm and hurt it all, folks, and that's the one time I've had one of them do that, and it's always the same story.
[02:36:27.306 --> 02:36:29.448]  We're bringing in world government to help the poor people.
[02:36:29.448 --> 02:36:33.652]  We've got to redistribute, it's true, but, you know, we can't let all these advanced technologies out to everybody.
[02:36:33.652 --> 02:36:34.813]  We'll destroy the planet.
[02:36:34.813 --> 02:36:35.634]  It's the same story.
[02:36:35.634 --> 02:36:42.100]  When you finally say no to them, then they shift gears, and it is an evil force.
[02:36:43.285 --> 02:36:53.932]  We're gonna go back to Joel Skousen here in a moment, get his take just on the overarching system, then I'm going right to James and Phil and Milton and Jeff and Organic Warrior and others.
[02:36:55.225 --> 02:36:56.966]  Briefly, we're running a special.
[02:36:56.966 --> 02:37:02.291]  We had to end, you know, over 1,000 items up to 40% off because a lot of the stuff was selling out.
[02:37:02.291 --> 02:37:09.497]  We can't have those special deals for too long with some of the distributors or manufacturers because they're distributors and undercuts for other folks they're selling to.
[02:37:09.497 --> 02:37:11.218]  People don't want to discount stuff like we do.
[02:37:11.218 --> 02:37:20.445]  But whether it's the best vitamin, mineral, fusion, fruit drink, absorbable, good things for your family, or whether it's DNA Force or Brain Force, Naturopik, Natural Healthy Brain Booster,
[02:37:21.286 --> 02:37:24.667]  They're 40% off, 30% off, and 30% off.
[02:37:24.667 --> 02:37:27.388]  Those three items, we're still offering them at the same discount.
[02:37:27.388 --> 02:37:29.589]  They're best sellers.
[02:37:29.589 --> 02:37:35.991]  And we also are offering free shipping on those.
[02:37:35.991 --> 02:37:38.192]  Usually, if $50 or more, it's free shipping.
[02:37:38.192 --> 02:37:40.253]  No, it's just free shipping, period.
[02:37:40.253 --> 02:37:44.334]  And we also are offering 10% off when you sign up for AutoShip, additionally.
[02:37:44.334 --> 02:37:46.255]  InfowarsStore.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:37:50.379 --> 02:37:56.268]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support and what you've been doing, whether you buy a ball cap or Hillary for prison cap, your funding.
[02:37:56.268 --> 02:38:00.154]  I guess the only folks crazy enough to try to put on a major defense against these people.
[02:38:01.127 --> 02:38:04.068]  And you know, I do ask myself, because this is not fun, okay, at this point.
[02:38:04.068 --> 02:38:04.808]  This is not fun.
[02:38:04.808 --> 02:38:05.728]  It's not a power trip.
[02:38:05.728 --> 02:38:08.269]  It's actually nauseating at some points.
[02:38:08.269 --> 02:38:11.270]  But I have to do this, even though I'm not stupid.
[02:38:11.270 --> 02:38:12.290]  I know where this road goes.
[02:38:12.290 --> 02:38:13.851]  I mean, it's okay.
[02:38:13.851 --> 02:38:16.892]  Because I will not join with these people.
[02:38:16.892 --> 02:38:17.512]  Let me tell you something.
[02:38:17.512 --> 02:38:22.973]  If I passively know about this and just back off, I'm in peril.
[02:38:22.973 --> 02:38:23.453]  Okay?
[02:38:23.453 --> 02:38:25.674]  And I'm in peril with the guy upstairs, okay?
[02:38:25.674 --> 02:38:28.295]  So, I'm telling you, this is spiritual and
[02:38:30.017 --> 02:38:32.559]  I've got ABC News saying soon all kids will have microchips.
[02:38:32.559 --> 02:38:34.940]  They're just throwing it in our face.
[02:38:34.940 --> 02:38:37.102]  Soon we're going to forcibly inoculate you.
[02:38:37.102 --> 02:38:37.982]  Blah blah blah.
[02:38:37.982 --> 02:38:40.224]  I mean it is getting so over the top.
[02:38:40.224 --> 02:38:42.045]  Joel, speaking about the spirit.
[02:38:42.895 --> 02:38:43.115]  I don't
[02:39:13.315 --> 02:39:17.996]  That I can see their works and everything they do, it's just like, why can't other people see this?
[02:39:17.996 --> 02:39:19.336]  Why aren't we resisting it?
[02:39:19.336 --> 02:39:22.137]  Why do we have to go down this road, Joel?
[02:39:22.137 --> 02:39:29.899]  Well, it's because most people don't get that close to it, Alex, so that they feel that fear, they feel that nausea.
[02:39:29.899 --> 02:39:35.480]  The conspiracy and the satanic forces are so good at putting out believable people in front of you.
[02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:38.661]  Now, I'm not saying that Hillary Clinton is one of those, that's one of her big problems.
[02:39:39.261 --> 02:39:45.710]  But you know, when they seduced the conservatives and the Republicans with George W. Bush, they put out a fairly benign-looking guy.
[02:39:45.710 --> 02:39:50.817]  You know, he wasn't too smart, but it really fooled a lot of people for a lot of years.
[02:39:50.817 --> 02:39:53.160]  And they did the same with Dick Cheney and others.
[02:39:54.582 --> 02:40:02.447]  And so, it's the... I mean, look, they paraded Rudolf Giuliani in front of the people of the Republican Party.
[02:40:02.447 --> 02:40:13.475]  I mean, this is just incredible to have a cross-dressing, morally incompetent person out there pretending to be the great mayor's mayor and champion of 9-11.
[02:40:13.475 --> 02:40:15.897]  He was one of the conspirators of 9-11.
[02:40:15.897 --> 02:40:17.398]  And the Republican Party bought it.
[02:40:18.066 --> 02:40:31.835]  I mean, this is the kind of thing that we're dealing with, is the sophistication of putting in front of us, and then you have your idiots like Mitt Romney, you know, who is an urbane guy who gets talked into something.
[02:40:31.835 --> 02:40:34.657]  You know, he's not a direct conspirator.
[02:40:34.657 --> 02:40:40.260]  I agree with you though, because look at how he flip-flops against Trump, now he's for Trump.
[02:40:40.260 --> 02:40:42.442]  I mean, he just seems like he just flip-flops around.
[02:40:43.584 --> 02:40:45.225]  Yeah, he's not an annoying conspirator.
[02:40:45.225 --> 02:40:51.767]  Your people like Brent Scowcroft and Richard Armitage, these are real conspirators playing the Republican side.
[02:40:51.767 --> 02:40:56.968]  But they like useful idiots like Mitt Romney and other people who they can, you know, convince people.
[02:40:56.968 --> 02:41:00.269]  And they've sabotaged the entire state of Utah against Trump.
[02:41:00.269 --> 02:41:05.591]  I mean, it's the first time since they voted for Lyndon Baines Johnson that they might vote for a Democrat.
[02:41:06.289 --> 02:41:16.300]  And, you know, Idaho is a conservative bastion as well, but you've got mainstream Republican leaders who are talking them against Trump.
[02:41:16.300 --> 02:41:18.142]  And so this is the sophistication.
[02:41:18.142 --> 02:41:26.151]  This is why people don't see it as they put, you know, dumb sheep out there in front of us who lead people.
[02:41:26.151 --> 02:41:26.312]  So.
[02:41:27.458 --> 02:41:28.400]  What is the end game?
[02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:42.281]  If the Anglo-American establishment is the dominant world government predator group, I think that's clear, I think it's probably more powerful than the other two combined, correct me if you think I'm wrong, it gets full control, what does it then do?
[02:41:44.312 --> 02:41:45.874]  Well, then it starts really clamping down.
[02:41:45.874 --> 02:41:54.746]  I think after this war is started, after they start to get together, I think they're going to be a global new citizenship compact.
[02:41:54.746 --> 02:41:56.948]  They're going to say we're going to have to be global citizens.
[02:41:56.948 --> 02:41:59.672]  Everyone's going to have to swear allegiance to the no global government.
[02:41:59.672 --> 02:42:00.853]  And we need to do this.
[02:42:01.674 --> 02:42:08.836]  And you won't be able to be a professional, you won't be able to buy or sell, I think this is like a mark of the beast, unless you're a global citizen.
[02:42:08.836 --> 02:42:24.041]  And most people will not see anything wrong with this, but they'll say, you know, there are people who are working against this great patriotic war, there are people who don't support our troops, the people who believe in conspiracy, that we, the government, were responsible for bringing this nuclear strike upon you.
[02:42:24.041 --> 02:42:25.502]  We need to lock these people up.
[02:42:25.502 --> 02:42:26.682]  I think we'll be the Jews
[02:42:27.705 --> 02:42:30.206]  And the Japanese of World War III, Alex.
[02:42:30.206 --> 02:42:43.333]  And I think it happens because of a global citizenship, because of a tightening of the noose to say, you've all got to get on board, we can't tolerate the kind of dissidence we had during the Donald Trump fiasco a few years before.
[02:42:43.333 --> 02:42:45.374]  And I think they'll use that against people.
[02:42:45.374 --> 02:42:52.397]  So that's the endgame, is to tie everyone down into a, worse than political correctness, a complete silencing
[02:42:52.957 --> 02:42:56.540]  Sure, but Joel, you're there, I'm there, Matt Drudge is there, countless others.
[02:42:56.540 --> 02:42:59.382]  What we're covering is the hottest thing out there because it's reality.
[02:42:59.382 --> 02:43:01.364]  I mean, it's just growing exponentially.
[02:43:01.364 --> 02:43:14.735]  I mean, I think, I understand that, you know, the elite are powerful and they've got this guidance from the other side, but I mean, I just think that we can short-circuit their program.
[02:43:14.735 --> 02:43:15.896]  I think there's hope.
[02:43:15.896 --> 02:43:17.397]  And here's how we do it, Alex.
[02:43:17.397 --> 02:43:19.859]  I mean, you can, if you can get to Trump,
[02:43:20.919 --> 02:43:26.441]  To establish a team, an alternative team to his mainstream people, to advise him on how to stop.
[02:43:26.441 --> 02:43:29.382]  I mean, I could tell him how to stop ISIS.
[02:43:29.382 --> 02:43:36.604]  First of all, you can't stop ISIS unless you shut down their government black operations, but that's very difficult to do when they control the CIA, the NSA.
[02:43:36.604 --> 02:43:42.846]  I mean, how do you go in and shut down something where all the leaders of those agencies are on the dark side?
[02:43:42.846 --> 02:43:43.767]  You can't shut them down.
[02:43:43.767 --> 02:43:48.028]  But what you could do, because they don't control the military, you could say, all right,
[02:43:48.568 --> 02:43:58.562]  I'm going to give an order as Commander-in-Chief or get Trump to do this to say that no military is to take any more orders from the CIA or the NSA or any other agency.
[02:43:58.562 --> 02:43:59.564]  Sure, split that back up.
[02:44:00.865 --> 02:44:15.097]  But the Commander-in-Chief, and we're going to put that military inside Syria with the permission of Assad, and we're going to close his border to any transport coming from Turkey or Saudi Arabia through Jordan, so that no supplies get to ISIS.
[02:44:15.097 --> 02:44:17.600]  You're going to starve ISIS within about a month.
[02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:19.722]  That's right.
[02:44:19.722 --> 02:44:25.727]  Well, it's going to come out that Hillary is arming them and involved, and we know that, and they're letting them back into Britain, the jihadis.
[02:44:25.727 --> 02:44:26.588]  I mean, this is so clear.
[02:44:27.489 --> 02:44:28.310]  Yeah.
[02:44:28.310 --> 02:44:38.078]  But you see, if we're going to do something, rather than just broadcast and alert people to it, it's to get to Trump, to get some team that can advise him counter-terrorism.
[02:44:38.078 --> 02:44:39.459]  Here's the good thing and the bad thing about Trump.
[02:44:39.459 --> 02:44:41.300]  He really is doing everything himself.
[02:44:41.300 --> 02:44:50.108]  I mean, I can just tell you, and I'm not going to obviously mediate like a big deal out of it, but I mean, Trump really does just call people and ask their advice on things and do his own research.
[02:44:50.108 --> 02:44:55.912]  He does it like 18 hours a day, and he's really, really smart in a lot of ways, but at the same time,
[02:44:57.453 --> 02:44:58.513]  I mean, I guess it's good in a way.
[02:44:58.513 --> 02:45:02.494]  He's super confident and he thinks that he knows what he's doing.
[02:45:02.494 --> 02:45:03.574]  So who am I to say?
[02:45:03.574 --> 02:45:06.355]  I mean, what would you say?
[02:45:06.355 --> 02:45:08.575]  I mean, let's say I talk to Donald Trump 15 minutes tomorrow.
[02:45:08.575 --> 02:45:10.855]  Joel Skousen, what would I say to him?
[02:45:10.855 --> 02:45:19.137]  Well, the first thing I'd tell him is how you cannot beat ISIS because of the dark side of government, how they're funding ISIS and how they're doing it through Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
[02:45:19.137 --> 02:45:19.957]  Well, he knows that.
[02:45:19.957 --> 02:45:22.957]  He's talked about Turkey doing it and stuff.
[02:45:22.957 --> 02:45:25.658]  Well, I'm not sure he does because he talks about, well,
[02:45:26.970 --> 02:45:29.031]  He knows the public is getting sound bites.
[02:45:29.031 --> 02:45:29.852]  He's giving the speeches.
[02:45:29.852 --> 02:45:30.772]  He knows all that.
[02:45:30.772 --> 02:45:32.273]  He knows what Hillary's doing.
[02:45:32.273 --> 02:45:33.013]  He's got military.
[02:45:33.013 --> 02:45:34.974]  He's got Flynn telling him everything.
[02:45:34.974 --> 02:45:37.496]  He hangs out with Flynn constantly.
[02:45:37.496 --> 02:45:39.537]  Yeah, but Flynn doesn't know.
[02:45:39.537 --> 02:45:45.160]  Well, General Flynn has come out and said Obama ordered us to basically arm ISIS.
[02:45:45.160 --> 02:45:45.380]  Well...
[02:45:46.656 --> 02:45:50.301]  Look, there isn't any general who isn't a yes-man to the establishment.
[02:45:50.301 --> 02:45:51.703]  I'd be really surprised if he knew.
[02:45:51.703 --> 02:46:01.015]  I mean, look at all of the information that Gowdy got out of the Benghazi hearings about a stand-down, and yet he wasn't part of his final report.
[02:46:01.796 --> 02:46:06.040]  I mean, even people who know, know that they're afraid to come out and say it openly.
[02:46:06.040 --> 02:46:16.989]  But I just don't trust anyone to tell Trump the truth unless we get somebody on the inside who can sit down with him and talk to them about how this world where the opposites operates.
[02:46:16.989 --> 02:46:21.113]  He is too confident about saying that I know how the world operates and he does not.
[02:46:21.113 --> 02:46:28.539]  He may have some general idea of some things, but he needs some detailed information about how this government is
[02:46:29.620 --> 02:46:30.922]  Backing ISIS.
[02:46:30.922 --> 02:46:32.263]  And that's the only way you can stop it.
[02:46:38.103 --> 02:46:45.246]  The world operates through controlling the media, through controlling government, all three branches, controlling judges.
[02:46:45.246 --> 02:46:49.188]  They suborn about 75% of Congress because of dirt that they have on them.
[02:46:49.188 --> 02:46:51.869]  Of course, they control the executive.
[02:46:51.869 --> 02:46:55.971]  All of the agencies have controlled individuals at the top.
[02:46:55.971 --> 02:47:00.373]  This is a very, very difficult system to beat, but you've got to start somewhere.
[02:47:00.373 --> 02:47:06.116]  And I think you can start, first of all, by not doing any globalist trade agreements like Trump and shutting the border down.
[02:47:06.796 --> 02:47:08.757]  And then stopping black operations.
[02:47:08.757 --> 02:47:11.378]  That's why they killed Jack Kennedy.
[02:47:11.378 --> 02:47:14.179]  They killed him because he was going to stop CIA black operations.
[02:47:14.179 --> 02:47:21.261]  He was mad as hell after McGeorge Bundy shut down the air support for the Bay of Pigs.
[02:47:21.261 --> 02:47:24.783]  And that's when he went after the CIA, and I think that's why they killed him.
[02:47:24.783 --> 02:47:33.686]  So this is a tough thing to have, but Trump is going to need some insiders of our type on his team if he's going to understand
[02:47:34.526 --> 02:47:37.987]  As they present, you know, what he should be doing, what the counter to that is.
[02:47:37.987 --> 02:47:42.548]  And if you've got influence with Roger Stone, I would highly suggest that you... Yeah, it's beyond that.
[02:47:42.548 --> 02:47:43.849]  I don't want to get into the whole thing.
[02:47:43.849 --> 02:47:47.110]  I mean, I just, you know, I mean, our information obviously gets out everywhere.
[02:47:47.110 --> 02:47:50.111]  And the thing is, it's just, I'm in way over my head.
[02:47:50.111 --> 02:47:51.071]  I think the whole world is.
[02:47:51.071 --> 02:47:52.271]  These globalists think they're in control.
[02:47:52.271 --> 02:47:54.132]  They're the ones that are really deceived.
[02:47:54.132 --> 02:47:58.653]  Our guest, again, is the editor of WorldAtFirstBrief.com, Joel Skousen.
[02:47:58.653 --> 02:47:59.353]  Really smart guy.
[02:47:59.353 --> 02:48:01.554]  He's the head of the big major conservative coalition with Reagan.
[02:48:02.134 --> 02:48:03.754]  Hey Alex, good to talk to you again.
[02:48:03.754 --> 02:48:04.514]  It's been a while.
[02:48:04.514 --> 02:48:04.795]  Go ahead.
[02:48:04.795 --> 02:48:07.675]  A couple of real quick questions or real quick statements.
[02:48:07.675 --> 02:48:10.756]  I wish Trump would come out and say something about the chemtrails.
[02:48:10.756 --> 02:48:11.196]  I know he sees them.
[02:48:30.700 --> 02:48:35.165]  And I wish he'd back that lady that's running against John McCain.
[02:48:35.165 --> 02:48:38.308]  And lastly, Joel, this is for you.
[02:48:38.308 --> 02:48:42.792]  How far should we be away from a major city in case there's a nuclear strike?
[02:48:45.430 --> 02:48:50.814]  Well, the important thing is you've got to be at least five miles from an actual nuclear target.
[02:48:50.814 --> 02:48:56.239]  So any major communication or military site, you've got to be five miles away to be free from the blast.
[02:48:56.239 --> 02:48:59.281]  If you're free from the blast, you're free to move.
[02:48:59.281 --> 02:49:07.608]  But that's one of the reasons why I put out the World Affairs Brief, because I track what's going to happen with this war and when it's coming and things probably more accurately than anyone else.
[02:49:07.608 --> 02:49:09.270]  So if you have advanced warning,
[02:49:09.750 --> 02:49:14.072]  You won't be in a major city because it could be panicky in terms of getting out.
[02:49:14.072 --> 02:49:16.013]  So it's not a matter of distance from.
[02:49:16.013 --> 02:49:25.178]  It's the strategy you take and planning to to at least watch the signs so that you see when this war is coming, when the strike is coming to get out of any major city.
[02:49:25.578 --> 02:49:31.923]  You know, why are you confident if the Russians are going to do a pre-strike that they aren't going to take out populations and only take out military?
[02:49:31.923 --> 02:49:35.927]  How do you know they're going to try to order a capitulation by hitting them?
[02:49:35.927 --> 02:49:38.949]  I mean, there's so many weapons caches, so many offshore stuff.
[02:49:38.949 --> 02:49:43.013]  A lot of analysts think if there's any exchange to start, it's going to just go total Armageddon.
[02:49:44.755 --> 02:49:46.236]  Well, you've got to remember that the U.S.
[02:49:46.236 --> 02:49:49.337]  cannot respond if you absorb a nuclear first strike.
[02:49:49.337 --> 02:49:52.058]  All of our ground-based missiles, siloed, are gone.
[02:49:52.058 --> 02:49:55.480]  And you've got 50% of your submarines in base at any one time.
[02:49:55.480 --> 02:50:01.323]  They'll be taken out in strikes on Kings Bay, Georgia and Bangor, Washington.
[02:50:01.883 --> 02:50:03.623]  And so you've got six submarines out there.
[02:50:03.623 --> 02:50:09.545]  None of their warheads are big enough to target main things or main bunkers in Russia or China.
[02:50:09.545 --> 02:50:13.066]  So I just don't think how you can have a major exchange.
[02:50:13.066 --> 02:50:18.207]  It's a one way exchange and a little bit of retaliation if you absorb a nuclear first strike.
[02:50:18.207 --> 02:50:24.809]  My theory is, though, that the Russians and Chinese have never been able to survive without Western technology.
[02:50:24.809 --> 02:50:29.070]  So it's not in their interest to hit cities and destroy all the technology.
[02:50:29.870 --> 02:50:37.455]  They want to hit the military first in order to then say, look, if you don't want your cities hit, then let's make a deal.
[02:50:37.455 --> 02:50:40.937]  And that's what I think their theory is.
[02:50:40.937 --> 02:50:49.243]  But the minute those cities start getting hit by cruise missiles launched from submarines, there's going to be submarines and weapons smuggled up to the border launched against Russia.
[02:50:49.243 --> 02:50:55.187]  I just I mean, if the establishment's really thinking about having a controlled nuclear war, they're crazier than I thought they were.
[02:50:55.187 --> 02:50:56.448]  But certainly see the preparations.
[02:50:56.448 --> 02:50:57.328]  Thank you, Milton.
[02:50:57.328 --> 02:50:59.150]  More calls for Ed James and others.
[02:50:59.150 --> 02:50:59.510]  Stay with us.
[02:51:00.030 --> 02:51:02.612]  Honey, I'm really worried about our retirement funds.
[02:51:02.612 --> 02:51:03.612]  Oh, me too.
[02:51:03.612 --> 02:51:06.434]  We lost so much value in the recession in the stock market.
[02:51:06.434 --> 02:51:08.235]  I'm worried we won't have enough to retire.
[02:51:08.235 --> 02:51:12.377]  Jim next door told me that he had set up a new kind of IRA with a gold-silver group.
[02:51:12.377 --> 02:51:14.098]  He said how simple and safe it was.
[02:51:14.098 --> 02:51:18.781]  It's a private storage IRA, and we could have real gold and silver in our hands.
[02:51:18.781 --> 02:51:19.221]  Really?
[02:51:19.221 --> 02:51:21.362]  You mean we can actually see it and touch it?
[02:51:21.582 --> 02:51:22.423]  Absolutely.
[02:51:22.423 --> 02:51:26.307]  Jim said we could have all the benefits of an IRA to help build our retirement income.
[02:51:26.307 --> 02:51:28.870]  Bottom line, we would own a real tangible asset.
[02:51:28.870 --> 02:51:32.774]  And we would have the security of knowing we're protected, no matter what the economy does.
[02:51:32.774 --> 02:51:33.394]  What do you think?
[02:51:33.394 --> 02:51:36.538]  I think we need to find out how to get our own private storage IRA.
[02:51:36.538 --> 02:51:38.500]  We need to call the GoldSilver Group right now.
[02:51:38.740 --> 02:51:40.622]  Are you ready to protect your future?
[02:51:40.622 --> 02:51:51.694]  Call 800-421-3432 now to find out how easy and safe it is to set up a private storage IRA with GoldSilver Group and find out how you can qualify for up to $700 in free silver.
[02:51:51.694 --> 02:51:54.336]  All transactions are privately delivered and fully insured.
[02:51:54.336 --> 02:51:55.117]  Please call us now.
[02:51:55.117 --> 02:51:55.177]  800-421-3432.
[02:51:55.177 --> 02:51:55.217]  800-421-3432.
[02:51:59.762 --> 02:52:07.928]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[02:52:07.928 --> 02:52:08.749]  Here's why.
[02:52:08.749 --> 02:52:12.872]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[02:52:12.872 --> 02:52:13.792]  So please listen.
[02:52:13.792 --> 02:52:17.495]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:52:17.495 --> 02:52:23.840]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:52:23.840 --> 02:52:27.923]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[02:52:28.143 --> 02:52:31.105]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[02:52:31.105 --> 02:52:33.446]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[02:52:33.446 --> 02:52:38.269]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[02:52:38.269 --> 02:52:44.992]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[02:52:44.992 --> 02:52:46.713]  So it's a good time to check it out.

[02:53:00.782 --> 02:53:02.243]  You've heard about bunkers.
[02:53:02.243 --> 02:53:04.984]  But surviving is not recreation.
[02:53:04.984 --> 02:53:07.726]  And man wasn't made to live underground.
[02:53:07.726 --> 02:53:09.887]  Introducing Survivalist Camps.

[02:54:04.895 --> 02:54:07.296]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:54:07.296 --> 02:54:11.217]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:54:11.217 --> 02:54:13.778]  Couple little announcements here.
[02:54:13.778 --> 02:54:17.360]  This is out of the Associated Press and Fox News.
[02:54:17.360 --> 02:54:20.561]  FBI agent charged with acting as an agent of China.
[02:54:20.561 --> 02:54:28.544]  A veteran FBI electronics technician, but a top-secret clearance, pled guilty on Monday to one of acting as an agent of China and faces up to 10 years in prison.
[02:54:28.544 --> 02:54:31.925]  Massive, massive infiltration.
[02:54:31.925 --> 02:54:32.966]  Continuing, uh,
[02:54:33.886 --> 02:54:34.868]  Why?
[02:54:34.868 --> 02:54:40.515]  Here's why the jublicans, or neocon republicans, support Hillary.
[02:54:40.515 --> 02:54:42.979]  Did you know the Bushes and the Clintons party together?
[02:54:42.979 --> 02:54:45.442]  And they have for 30 years, before the Clintons even ran for office.
[02:54:45.442 --> 02:54:47.244]  Total CIA.
[02:54:47.244 --> 02:54:47.605]  Total.
[02:54:49.764 --> 02:54:51.345]  Continuing, we have the winner.
[02:54:51.345 --> 02:54:52.046]  I was going to announce it Friday.
[02:54:52.046 --> 02:54:53.847]  There were too many entries that were all great.
[02:54:53.847 --> 02:54:55.088]  Hillary is a great white shark.
[02:54:55.088 --> 02:55:01.033]  I saw that photo of her on Drudge where she was going up like a great white about to crest.
[02:55:01.033 --> 02:55:04.596]  And so the winner has been announced at Infowars.com.
[02:55:04.596 --> 02:55:04.816]  $1,000.
[02:55:04.816 --> 02:55:09.039]  So email us at showtips or there on the link and we will send you $1,000.
[02:55:09.039 --> 02:55:09.359]  Justin Gammon.
[02:55:11.781 --> 02:55:13.642]  And he's got the winning entry.
[02:55:13.642 --> 02:55:16.003]  We'll show that to TV viewers right now.
[02:55:16.003 --> 02:55:18.184]  If you just tuned in.
[02:55:18.184 --> 02:55:20.165]  They're trying to ban stuff like this on Twitter and Facebook.
[02:55:20.165 --> 02:55:22.046]  They hate these memes.
[02:55:22.046 --> 02:55:23.047]  But there she is.
[02:55:23.047 --> 02:55:24.488]  So, a lot of fun.
[02:55:24.488 --> 02:55:25.888]  A thousand bucks there.
[02:55:25.888 --> 02:55:29.770]  And then a really important article, like I said, that article that Kit did.
[02:55:29.770 --> 02:55:31.031]  Very important to see that.
[02:55:31.031 --> 02:55:32.752]  Okay, let's take some more calls for this segment.
[02:55:32.752 --> 02:55:34.493]  The next, David Knight takes over.
[02:55:34.493 --> 02:55:37.154]  Let's talk to James in Texas.
[02:55:37.154 --> 02:55:38.175]  You're on the air with Joel Skousen.
[02:55:38.175 --> 02:55:38.395]  Go ahead.
[02:55:39.781 --> 02:55:43.944]  Hey Alex, long time listener, first time caller, and a big fan of Bill Skousen as well.
[02:55:43.944 --> 02:55:44.584]  Thank you, go ahead.
[02:55:44.584 --> 02:55:48.267]  Strategic location is definitely something on my mind right now.
[02:55:48.267 --> 02:55:57.453]  But I just wanted to call in to address one of the closing comments from yesterday's show, that some of your sources are indicating that Russia was the source of the DNC leaks.
[02:55:57.453 --> 02:56:02.397]  And I just wanted to put aside Russia's intelligence capabilities, their potential motives,
[02:56:02.921 --> 02:56:13.392]  And I just wanted to point out that it took the FBI over a year of exhaustive investigation to come to the conclusion that they could neither confirm nor deny that a foreign breach occurred on Secretary Clinton's server.
[02:56:13.392 --> 02:56:23.722]  And I just wanted to ask you if it seems more than a little convenient to you and a little suspicious that our intelligence agencies are able to determine Russia's involvement in the DNC leaks.
[02:56:24.318 --> 02:56:28.041]  Nearly instantly now, and with a high level of certainty.
[02:56:28.041 --> 02:56:31.523]  Well, I mean, they're lying about how long it took them to get info before on Hillary.
[02:56:31.523 --> 02:56:33.364]  They were dragging their feet.
[02:56:33.364 --> 02:56:41.330]  I mean, it's pretty well known that the Russians have been somewhat promoting Donald Trump, but I mean, it might not be.
[02:56:41.330 --> 02:56:42.451]  To me, it's a distraction.
[02:56:42.451 --> 02:56:43.691]  The emails show what we already know.
[02:56:43.691 --> 02:56:47.094]  They haven't denied their authenticity, so I think it puts the car before the horse.
[02:56:47.094 --> 02:56:47.294]  Joel?
[02:56:48.854 --> 02:56:54.637]  William Binney has said that the NSA can track every piece of code that comes into every server in the United States.
[02:56:54.637 --> 02:56:59.999]  That means they can track if the Russians hacked and how they hacked or who it was, whether it's anonymous.
[02:56:59.999 --> 02:57:03.001]  So I think our government is just playing games with us here.
[02:57:03.001 --> 02:57:05.682]  They know who did the hacking.
[02:57:05.682 --> 02:57:06.643]  Well, who do you think?
[02:57:06.643 --> 02:57:11.385]  I mean, just who stands to gain here, Joel?
[02:57:11.385 --> 02:57:12.726]  The Communist Chinese love Hillary.
[02:57:12.726 --> 02:57:13.426]  They wouldn't do it.
[02:57:15.202 --> 02:57:26.131]  Yeah, I just don't think that, you know, the Russians, they do have hackers that work through things, but what I'm just saying is that I think it's irrelevant who did the hacking.
[02:57:26.131 --> 02:57:37.640]  She has been hacked, and Russia is not revealing those unless Assange comes out and reveals, he's claiming that he has new information that's going to indict Hillary.
[02:57:37.640 --> 02:57:38.760]  Look, look, here's the deal.
[02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:43.524]  Russia admitted, basically, they passed it to credit for the climate gate emails.
[02:57:43.524 --> 02:57:44.125]  Well, thank God!
[02:57:44.645 --> 02:57:48.287]  Yeah, the UN working with East Anglia to hide the decline in carbon taxes.
[02:57:48.287 --> 02:57:49.068]  So great!
[02:57:49.068 --> 02:57:51.529]  Russia knows that carbon taxes are meant to shut their economy down.
[02:57:51.529 --> 02:57:52.430]  It's meant to hurt us, too.
[02:57:52.430 --> 02:57:53.631]  So good!
[02:57:53.631 --> 02:58:00.255]  I mean, if Russia has evidence that Hillary Clinton's barbecuing small children, hypothetically, they should release it, right, Joel?
[02:58:00.255 --> 02:58:03.337]  Except they don't want to let our government know how much they know.
[02:58:03.337 --> 02:58:04.598]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:58:04.598 --> 02:58:06.279]  I'm not saying she's barbecuing children, folks.
[02:58:06.279 --> 02:58:07.420]  It's hypothetical.
[02:58:07.420 --> 02:58:09.381]  James in Texas, great point.
[02:58:09.381 --> 02:58:10.602]  Let's talk real fast.
[02:58:10.602 --> 02:58:11.142]  We're going to break.
[02:58:11.142 --> 02:58:12.703]  We'll come back and get your answer after.
[02:58:12.703 --> 02:58:13.804]  Nathan in Tennessee, go ahead.
[02:58:17.902 --> 02:58:19.503]  Good, go ahead.
[02:58:19.503 --> 02:58:23.065]  Hold on, I mean, I don't know how hypothetically we're getting at here.
[02:58:23.065 --> 02:58:25.606]  Just try to quantify it when we come back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:25.606 --> 02:58:27.387]  I'll come back to you, Nathan.
[02:58:49.873 --> 02:58:51.515]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:58:51.515 --> 02:58:52.997]  You can't survive without it.
[02:58:52.997 --> 02:58:54.199]  But where do you get it?
[02:58:54.199 --> 02:59:00.187]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:59:00.187 --> 02:59:05.915]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:59:06.095 --> 02:59:22.977]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[02:59:52.344 --> 02:59:54.949]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:02.984 --> 03:00:04.804]  We are on the march.
[03:00:04.804 --> 03:00:07.945]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:00:07.945 --> 03:00:12.606]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:12.606 --> 03:00:14.367]  There are a lot of good things happening.
[03:00:14.367 --> 03:00:18.688]  You can just feel the inexorable evil in the world intensifying.
[03:00:18.688 --> 03:00:20.148]  And you just ask yourself, why?
[03:00:20.148 --> 03:00:20.508]  Why?
[03:00:20.508 --> 03:00:26.470]  Because people running things are committed to a larger plan.
[03:00:26.470 --> 03:00:31.371]  And this world has to be destroyed before they think their Valhalla can be manifest.
[03:00:31.371 --> 03:00:32.071]  They are insane.
[03:00:33.095 --> 03:00:36.396]  Uh, whether you believe in God or not, these people do, and they believe in a very evil God.
[03:00:36.396 --> 03:00:40.558]  Nathan, real fast, are you saying maybe you want Trump again, and then, like, you'd be even more Ron Paul-ish?
[03:00:40.558 --> 03:00:42.659]  What are you saying?
[03:00:42.659 --> 03:00:54.103]  Well, what I want to hear is that for the people that don't really still want one over by, you know, Trump, you know, that they still don't, it's not that they're going to vote for Hillary, they're just kind of like, eh, I'm going to go, I was a Ron Paul guy, I don't care.
[03:00:54.103 --> 03:00:58.605]  I want to hear them say stuff like, we want patriots like Edward Snowden, Mike Clinton,
[03:00:59.187 --> 03:01:00.709]  Pardon all these scumbags in the past.
[03:01:00.709 --> 03:01:05.075]  I want him to pardon a guy like him who, in my view, is a political prisoner.
[03:01:05.075 --> 03:01:05.856]  Okay, I hear you Nathan.
[03:01:05.856 --> 03:01:07.018]  I'm going to jump swing it to everybody.
[03:01:07.018 --> 03:01:08.319]  I hear you.
[03:01:08.319 --> 03:01:11.443]  I think with Trump, you actually get what's going to happen.
[03:01:11.443 --> 03:01:13.086]  So I disagree with some things, but I mean, the guys...
[03:01:14.107 --> 03:01:21.771]  Pretty much just up there and he's not out to get the country and he actually thinks that he can be president and try to stop them and they just can't believe it.
[03:01:21.771 --> 03:01:27.974]  The fact that the system hates him so much legitimately shows how threatened they are by Donald Trump.
[03:01:27.974 --> 03:01:33.176]  Organic Warrior from California, you're on the air with Joel Skousen of worldaffairsbrief.com, go ahead.
[03:01:33.176 --> 03:01:36.358]  Joel Skousen, awesome guys, Alex Jones.
[03:01:36.358 --> 03:01:41.481]  Anyways, I want to kind of touch on the satanic agenda and the youth.
[03:01:42.594 --> 03:01:51.777]  You know, I skateboard and surf, but I always see, like, kids wearing pentagrams and 666, and I really think that they're trying to lock in on that.
[03:01:51.777 --> 03:01:58.719]  Yeah, they think it's a symbol of rebellion, but what they don't get is, yeah, sure, Satan revolted against God, but now Satan's in control of the planet.
[03:01:58.719 --> 03:02:03.280]  Real rebellion is not going with the devil.
[03:02:03.280 --> 03:02:04.461]  Correct.
[03:02:04.461 --> 03:02:11.583]  Also, people need to get off their iPhone 6s, stop waiting in the line at Starbucks, and go hold up a Hillary for President sign.
[03:02:12.378 --> 03:02:15.628]  Down here in San Diego, because I seem to be like, I'm the only guy doing it.
[03:02:20.915 --> 03:02:22.176]  Strategic Relocation.
[03:02:22.176 --> 03:02:23.117]  It's a great book.
[03:02:23.117 --> 03:02:27.001]  I mean, man, everything at that point, I guess when it happens, we just have to be ready.
[03:02:27.001 --> 03:02:29.683]  You know, storable food, non-GMO.
[03:02:29.683 --> 03:02:31.665]  Everything they do is about making us dependent.
[03:02:31.665 --> 03:02:32.266]  Exactly.
[03:02:32.266 --> 03:02:34.468]  We need to be, I mean, independent on them.
[03:02:34.468 --> 03:02:35.549]  We need to be independent.
[03:02:35.549 --> 03:02:37.230]  Thank you so much.
[03:02:37.230 --> 03:02:39.412]  Good to hear from you, Organic Warrior.
[03:02:39.412 --> 03:02:41.794]  Joel, do you want to comment on what he was talking about?
[03:02:41.794 --> 03:02:42.976]  The popularity of Satanism?
[03:02:44.687 --> 03:02:46.888]  Yeah, it's a fad.
[03:02:46.888 --> 03:02:48.068]  I think you nailed it, Alex.
[03:02:48.068 --> 03:02:49.849]  There's a bunch of rebellion.
[03:02:49.849 --> 03:02:56.352]  People think this is cool to do something anti-establishment, but it's not in the right direction, obviously, and very, very sad.
[03:02:56.352 --> 03:03:00.193]  I mean, could you be more establishment on this planet than to be a Satanist?
[03:03:00.193 --> 03:03:05.896]  I mean, that's really like... Yeah, that's how foolish they are, Alex.
[03:03:05.896 --> 03:03:09.277]  They don't realize that they're trying to fight what's normal.
[03:03:09.277 --> 03:03:12.799]  They're buying into what the major establishment controls.
[03:03:13.789 --> 03:03:14.810]  Joel, we're almost out of time.
[03:03:14.810 --> 03:03:17.292]  We've got a bunch of callers, but I'm going to just get to those after you're gone.
[03:03:17.292 --> 03:03:21.355]  I appreciate you spending an hour and a half with us.
[03:03:21.355 --> 03:03:23.797]  We've got Mark Cuban coming out endorses Hillary.
[03:03:23.797 --> 03:03:25.238]  That's just terrible.
[03:03:25.238 --> 03:03:31.482]  We've got a lot of other points, but what else in the next minute do you want to impart to folks?
[03:03:31.482 --> 03:03:36.006]  I want to answer your major conundrum, which you expressed that so many people expressed.
[03:03:36.006 --> 03:03:40.009]  Why would these people do this, absorb a nuclear first strike,
[03:03:40.930 --> 03:03:42.431]  Uh, and make us all vulnerable.
[03:03:42.431 --> 03:03:44.454]  I mean, it just seemed inconceivable.
[03:03:44.454 --> 03:03:47.157]  But my answer to that is this.
[03:03:47.157 --> 03:03:53.404]  That, you know, PDD-60, or Presidential Decision Directive 60, which changed our entire nuclear posture.
[03:03:55.066 --> 03:03:57.728]  Proves that they're going to absorb a nuclear first strike.
[03:03:57.728 --> 03:03:58.428]  All right.
[03:03:58.428 --> 03:04:00.590]  So look, these people are not dumb.
[03:04:00.590 --> 03:04:02.151]  These people are not stupid.
[03:04:02.151 --> 03:04:07.014]  They are not going to absorb a nuclear first strike unless they have an answer to that.
[03:04:07.014 --> 03:04:10.076]  And that answer, I believe, has to be these secret weapon systems.
[03:04:10.076 --> 03:04:11.257]  I believe they can stop
[03:04:12.057 --> 03:04:15.041]  Any missile systems coming in today, any and all.
[03:04:15.041 --> 03:04:25.976]  Well sure, Dr. Bob Bowman, when he was the head of Star Wars, before it was even made public, said that, he said, I can only tell you this is actually linked, and he said, we already had, you know, robot drones in orbit with, with D.U.
[03:04:25.976 --> 03:04:28.479]  Shabos that would take out the deepest bunkers in 1978.
[03:04:30.988 --> 03:04:33.229]  And so I think they're going to stop.
[03:04:33.229 --> 03:04:39.773]  And while they regroup under the global government that they're going to push upon us, they're going to stop any further missiles from coming in.
[03:04:39.773 --> 03:04:45.417]  And that's, I think, the answer to why there are, depending on the fact that they're not going to hit cities on the first strike.
[03:04:45.417 --> 03:04:46.237]  I mean, why would they?
[03:04:46.237 --> 03:04:47.698]  You want to hit the military first.
[03:04:47.698 --> 03:04:49.899]  You want to hit the missiles first so that you can't retaliate.
[03:04:49.899 --> 03:04:50.260]  No, I hear you.
[03:04:50.260 --> 03:04:52.521]  Look, I know you're a Marine Corps officer and know the research.
[03:04:52.521 --> 03:04:53.381]  And I've done the research, too.
[03:04:53.381 --> 03:04:55.343]  I understand this is what they're bringing us towards.
[03:04:55.343 --> 03:04:58.344]  Thank you so much, Joel.
[03:04:58.344 --> 03:04:58.625]  Thank you.
[03:04:58.625 --> 03:04:59.285]  We'll be back with David Knight.
[03:05:00.567 --> 03:05:06.392]  Hillary Clinton suggested the grieving families of victims of the Benghazi attack are liars, in an appearance on Fox News Sunday.
[03:05:06.392 --> 03:05:16.521]  While the corporate media obsessed over Donald Trump's response to a fallen soldier from a Muslim immigrant family, Clinton's response to Pat Smith over the death of her son in Libya was glossed over, as reported by Steve Watson.
[03:05:16.721 --> 03:05:23.205]  Clinton said, quote, I don't hold any ill feeling for someone who in that moment may not fully recall everything that was or wasn't said.
[03:05:23.205 --> 03:05:32.250]  Now that's a bold statement coming from Hillary's mouth considering the FBI revealed she lied numerous times about sending classified information over her unsecured private email server.
[03:05:32.250 --> 03:05:43.097]  Hillary's suggesting, once again, that families of the Benghazi victims didn't hear her properly when she told them the cause of the attack was an anti-Muslim YouTube video and that it was not a coordinated pre-planned terror attack.
[03:05:43.097 --> 03:05:45.358]  But private emails revealed Hillary knows the terrorist attack
[03:05:45.658 --> 03:05:54.828]  And additionally, the whole story about the YouTube video was a State Department fabrication to cover up the Department's role in shipping living weapons to jihadists in Syria via Benghazi.
[03:05:54.828 --> 03:05:57.350]  For more reports, visit Infowars.com.
[03:05:57.350 --> 03:05:58.531]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[03:05:59.525 --> 03:06:01.346]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:06:01.346 --> 03:06:03.447]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:06:03.447 --> 03:06:06.348]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:06:06.348 --> 03:06:12.410]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:06:12.410 --> 03:06:21.594]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:06:21.594 --> 03:06:26.456]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[03:06:26.676 --> 03:06:29.118]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:06:29.118 --> 03:06:37.143]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:06:37.143 --> 03:06:38.244]  The general public doesn't.
[03:06:39.330 --> 03:06:42.712]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:06:42.712 --> 03:06:46.853]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:06:46.853 --> 03:06:53.556]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[03:07:51.005 --> 03:07:52.706]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:07:52.706 --> 03:07:53.387]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:20.976 --> 03:08:22.256]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:22.256 --> 03:08:25.397]  I'm David Knight, your host on this fourth hour.
[03:08:25.397 --> 03:08:27.918]  Monday, August the 1st, 2016.
[03:08:27.918 --> 03:08:34.140]  August is already here, and of course next week we're going to have the primary with Paul Ryan.
[03:08:34.140 --> 03:08:38.001]  People who are in Wisconsin really need to pay attention to this, because you know what?
[03:08:38.001 --> 03:08:42.942]  If Donald Trump wins, his biggest opposition in Congress is going to be Paul Ryan.
[03:08:43.697 --> 03:08:49.319]  They need to understand what's going on here, and there's a couple of stories that are up on the Drudge Report talking about that.
[03:08:49.319 --> 03:08:54.742]  But I want to give you some perspective from the DNC that we covered last week.
[03:08:54.742 --> 03:09:02.425]  I'm going to talk about the, I would say, the con job that was done by this Muslim Brotherhood guy that everybody's been talking about all weekend.
[03:09:02.425 --> 03:09:08.228]  We're going to give you the background of some of these speakers that spoke at the Democrat Convention, especially the last day.
[03:09:09.228 --> 03:09:13.551]  The Muslim father of the soldier who was killed, also the general who got up.
[03:09:13.551 --> 03:09:22.598]  You know, there's a story on Reason Magazine saying that Allen gave the scariest speech from both the RNC and the DNC.
[03:09:22.598 --> 03:09:26.761]  They said John Allen had unrestrained warmongering.
[03:09:26.761 --> 03:09:30.823]  I would say, you know, we could say it's not just that he got up and said, I'm with her.
[03:09:31.624 --> 03:09:34.325]  He also said, I'm with war.
[03:09:34.325 --> 03:09:35.086]  Everywhere.
[03:09:35.086 --> 03:09:36.006]  At all times.
[03:09:36.006 --> 03:09:37.407]  And we're going to tell you a little bit about him.
[03:09:37.407 --> 03:09:42.029]  Did you remember that he was involved in the Petraeus scandal?
[03:09:42.029 --> 03:09:46.311]  That he was selected to be the head of NATO, but he abruptly resigned.
[03:09:46.311 --> 03:09:47.632]  So we're going to revisit all that for you.
[03:09:47.632 --> 03:09:49.453]  We're going to do a flashback about that.
[03:09:49.453 --> 03:09:53.735]  We're going to give you some background on this Muslim father that was speaking there.
[03:09:54.821 --> 03:10:05.791]  And I want to give you some, just kind of my feelings as to what happened the week that I spent at the Arkham Asylum this last week, otherwise known as the DNC.
[03:10:05.791 --> 03:10:11.055]  But first, let's take a look at this story from me, Kyle Thelen, that's up on InfoWars.com, just breaking.
[03:10:11.055 --> 03:10:18.021]  There's going to be a Clinton fundraiser set for the Black Hat Conference coming up in Las Vegas.
[03:10:18.021 --> 03:10:18.522]  How about that?
[03:10:19.042 --> 03:10:21.707]  I guess they want to raise money for Hillary Clinton.
[03:10:21.707 --> 03:10:24.351]  How's that for irony or hypocrisy?
[03:10:24.351 --> 03:10:25.833]  Take your pick either way.
[03:10:25.833 --> 03:10:33.405]  I guess the way these black hat hackers look at this is that a Clinton presidency would be a hacker's paradise.
[03:10:35.726 --> 03:10:40.748]  I guess it would really raise their stock because everybody would be saying, how do we stop all these leaks?
[03:10:40.748 --> 03:10:42.328]  Information is coming out of everywhere.
[03:10:42.328 --> 03:10:43.369]  We don't know how to stop this.
[03:10:43.369 --> 03:10:50.311]  Well, you know, you can stop it, first of all, by not putting all your classified emails on a private unsecured server.
[03:10:51.288 --> 03:10:55.669]  There's some very easy things that you can do to keep from having your information compromised.
[03:10:55.669 --> 03:11:00.771]  But of course, the people that I talked to at the DNC just really didn't care about that.
[03:11:00.771 --> 03:11:07.573]  They were far more interested in putting out conspiracy theories about Putin and Trump.
[03:11:07.573 --> 03:11:10.593]  But let's take a look at this article from Mikhail Thelin.
[03:11:10.593 --> 03:11:19.076]  They say, according to cybersecurity journalist Steve Reagan, the fundraiser will begin on Wednesday during the evening hours of Black Hat Conference in Vegas.
[03:11:20.226 --> 03:11:25.950]  They described this as focusing on policy issues that will be facing the next administration.
[03:11:25.950 --> 03:11:34.657]  You can bet that hacking is going to be a policy issue that is going to face the Clinton administration throughout this reign here.
[03:11:34.657 --> 03:11:38.940]  They say a Black Hat spokesman said that the fundraiser was vendor and politically neutral.
[03:11:38.940 --> 03:11:39.321]  Yeah, right.
[03:11:40.146 --> 03:11:43.248]  And it's being run completely independent of the conference.
[03:11:43.248 --> 03:11:46.930]  And I say, but you wouldn't know that from reading the fundraiser's announcement, said Reagan.
[03:11:46.930 --> 03:11:57.336]  He said, while Black Hat called the event unofficial, and Clinton herself is not going to be there, the idea of a presidential fundraiser at a hacker conference of any type just feels strange.
[03:11:57.336 --> 03:11:59.998]  Unless you're talking about Hillary Clinton.
[03:12:00.936 --> 03:12:07.019]  He goes on to add that there are no fundraisers being done at the hacking conference for Donald Trump.
[03:12:07.019 --> 03:12:08.780]  Now, who was behind this?
[03:12:08.780 --> 03:12:11.542]  That's been the big conspiracy theory because they don't want to talk about
[03:12:12.441 --> 03:12:14.102]  What's really happening here?
[03:12:14.102 --> 03:12:16.342]  They don't want to talk about the information that's been revealed.
[03:12:16.342 --> 03:12:19.143]  They want to do a very clever pivot.
[03:12:19.143 --> 03:12:25.006]  They're much more clever the way that they handle bad news than Donald Trump has been.
[03:12:25.006 --> 03:12:33.569]  I mean, Donald Trump stepped in it with his Muslim, just like he did with the La Raza judge, never pointing out that he was part of La Raza.
[03:12:34.485 --> 03:12:35.625]  La Raza.
[03:12:35.625 --> 03:12:37.026]  Everything for the race.
[03:12:37.026 --> 03:12:39.287]  For those outside of the race, nothing.
[03:12:39.287 --> 03:12:41.147]  That's their logo, folks.
[03:12:41.147 --> 03:12:45.028]  This is an Hispanic group that is called The Race.
[03:12:45.028 --> 03:12:51.531]  And yet, what he did was, he said, well, because of his Mexican heritage, I don't think I'm going to get a fair trial.
[03:12:51.531 --> 03:12:55.472]  No, he's not going to get a fair trial because this guy is a Muslim KKK.
[03:12:56.820 --> 03:13:01.522]  That's what he needed to point out, and he needed to point out the same thing about Khan, but he doesn't.
[03:13:01.522 --> 03:13:07.424]  Instead, when you look at the way the Democrats handle this kind of stuff, the Democrats come out and say, well, emails?
[03:13:07.424 --> 03:13:08.244]  What emails?
[03:13:08.244 --> 03:13:09.645]  There's nothing to see here.
[03:13:09.645 --> 03:13:10.325]  Move along.
[03:13:10.325 --> 03:13:13.486]  Just ignore it, pretend it never existed, and lie about it.
[03:13:13.486 --> 03:13:16.667]  There's a very interesting revelation from William Binney.
[03:13:16.667 --> 03:13:17.748]  You know, I said last week,
[03:13:18.468 --> 03:13:26.157]  I believed that if you really wanted to know who was behind this, you really had to think about, take a look at U.S.
[03:13:26.157 --> 03:13:27.438]  intelligence.
[03:13:27.438 --> 03:13:37.949]  I think they have as much if not far more motivation to expose Hillary Clinton as a criminal, as someone who cannot be trusted, than do the Russians.
[03:13:39.033 --> 03:13:47.200]  I think that all of this talk about, as I said when I talked to Alex from the convention, you know, they've got the other R word that they've been using.
[03:13:47.200 --> 03:13:49.302]  They have racist and now they come out with Russian.
[03:13:49.302 --> 03:13:52.285]  They want to attack Donald Trump because he's been America first.
[03:13:53.510 --> 03:13:59.315]  And they want to use this kind of McCarthyism, and it truly is a red herring.
[03:13:59.315 --> 03:14:00.275]  Okay?
[03:14:00.275 --> 03:14:03.558]  It is red baiting, red herring is what they're trying to do.
[03:14:03.558 --> 03:14:07.641]  I saw Carl Bernstein on the floor of the Democrat convention.
[03:14:07.641 --> 03:14:08.342]  I wanted to talk to him.
[03:14:08.342 --> 03:14:09.002]  He wouldn't talk to me.
[03:14:09.002 --> 03:14:13.405]  He did the same thing that Turd Blossom, Karl Rove did with Alex.
[03:14:13.405 --> 03:14:17.909]  I'm owned by CNN, is what he said.
[03:14:17.909 --> 03:14:21.232]  But I would have asked him, you know, Carl Bernstein, the guy that was part of the Watergate
[03:14:22.637 --> 03:14:23.217]  Exposure.
[03:14:23.217 --> 03:14:26.600]  I would have said, you know, you look like somebody that appreciated good leak.
[03:14:26.600 --> 03:14:29.061]  What do you think about this latest thing here?
[03:14:29.061 --> 03:14:35.305]  Remember, when you go back and look at Watergate, the deep throat was FBI.
[03:14:35.305 --> 03:14:36.926]  Okay, I think, where's the guy?
[03:14:36.926 --> 03:14:41.329]  I think he was number, was he number two, I think, in the FBI that eventually it came out.
[03:14:41.329 --> 03:14:51.476]  Nobody at the time, interestingly enough, even though we're at the height of the Cold War during Watergate, nobody suggested that the Russians were trying to do a coup against Richard Nixon.
[03:14:52.156 --> 03:14:56.378]  But, there were connections with the CIA, with the FBI, with the people at the very top.
[03:14:56.378 --> 03:15:12.267]  You have to understand, as William Binney pointed out, there are a lot of people who take their job seriously, as William Binney did, in the security business, that are absolutely furious and appalled and cannot believe what Hillary Clinton did, and that she's getting away with this.
[03:15:13.197 --> 03:15:15.879]  I talked to a friend of mine who's a retired colonel.
[03:15:15.879 --> 03:15:24.044]  They said if he and his wife, who is also a very high ranking military official, said if we'd done that, we'd have been in jail for the rest of our lives.
[03:15:24.044 --> 03:15:25.205]  All these people understand that.
[03:15:25.205 --> 03:15:26.025]  They've seen this happen.
[03:15:26.025 --> 03:15:30.288]  They've seen them go after whistleblowers that came out at the same time.
[03:15:30.288 --> 03:15:32.069]  Talking about how the government, after 9-11,
[03:15:33.499 --> 03:15:37.323]  was using dragnet surveillance in violation of the Constitution.
[03:15:37.323 --> 03:15:41.367]  See, people like William Benny and Thomas Drake take the Constitution very seriously.
[03:15:41.367 --> 03:15:46.512]  And unlike Khan, they absolutely, they understand what's in it.
[03:15:46.512 --> 03:15:48.494]  They understand what the Fourth Amendment is about.
[03:15:48.494 --> 03:15:53.438]  There is no right of immigration for Muslims into this country in the Constitution.
[03:15:53.438 --> 03:15:55.761]  There is no right for that, but there is a right to be left alone.
[03:15:56.826 --> 03:16:15.441]  And these people who take their job very seriously, who believe that there are secrets that need to be protected for our security, and who understand the penalties that they face, and then understand that when they expose criminal actions by the government, that they try to put them away as they did Thomas Drake for 35 years.
[03:16:15.441 --> 03:16:16.122]  Four documents.
[03:16:16.590 --> 03:16:18.030]  None of which were classified.
[03:16:18.030 --> 03:16:22.292]  One of them they classified that same day, then declassified it three months later.
[03:16:22.292 --> 03:16:24.392]  There was nothing at all to be classified by these.
[03:16:24.392 --> 03:16:29.814]  One of them said, well, it wasn't classified, but it should have been, and you should have known it, so we're going to charge you for having a classified document.
[03:16:29.814 --> 03:16:32.894]  It was simply a schedule of a past project.
[03:16:32.894 --> 03:16:34.215]  It didn't have any information on it.
[03:16:34.955 --> 03:16:36.295]  The project was already over.
[03:16:36.295 --> 03:16:37.576]  So what did William Binney say?
[03:16:37.576 --> 03:16:52.161]  We've had William Binney on our show several times, a true patriot, a true constitutionalist, somebody who has served his country in the intelligence industry, who has served us as trying to protect the Constitution as a whistleblower.
[03:16:52.161 --> 03:17:00.964]  This is what he said, he said, speaking as an analyst, this is a Breitbart story, Binney raised the possibility that the hack to the Democrat National Committee server was done not by Russia,
[03:17:01.624 --> 03:17:03.306]  But by disgruntled U.S.
[03:17:03.306 --> 03:17:11.192]  intelligence worker, concerned about Clinton's compromise of national security secrets via her personal email use.
[03:17:11.192 --> 03:17:26.105]  He referenced testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March 2011 by then-FBI Director Robert Mueller, in which Mueller spoke of the FBI's ability to access various secretive databases to quote, track down known and suspected terrorists.
[03:17:26.886 --> 03:17:44.233]  Okay, he said, now what Mueller is talking about is going into the NSA database, which is shown, of course, in the Snowden material released, which shows a direct access into the NSA database by the FBI and the CIA, which there is no oversight of, by the way.
[03:17:44.233 --> 03:17:52.117]  See, that's one of the things that Benny is concerned about, the fact that the FBI and the CIA can access this information in the NSA database.
[03:17:53.496 --> 03:17:56.299]  So that means that the NSA and a number of agencies in the U.S.
[03:17:56.299 --> 03:17:58.260]  government also have those emails.
[03:17:58.260 --> 03:18:06.748]  So if the FBI really wanted them, they can go into that database and they can get them right now.
[03:18:06.748 --> 03:18:11.872]  Okay, you know those 30,000 emails that Hillary Clinton's lawyers had the privilege?
[03:18:11.872 --> 03:18:13.854]  You want to talk about white privilege, Hillary Clinton?
[03:18:13.854 --> 03:18:16.977]  Let's talk about your political privilege.
[03:18:16.977 --> 03:18:18.098]  That's what's really dangerous.
[03:18:19.113 --> 03:18:33.484]  You have the political privilege that when you are suspected of violating the highest levels of national security, your lawyers are first allowed to go through and scrub what they don't want the FBI to see from your laptop.
[03:18:33.484 --> 03:18:36.806]  Now Benny is saying that they do have access to those emails.
[03:18:36.806 --> 03:18:43.211]  So then he was asked point-blank, and this was on Aaron Klein Investigative Radio, he was asked point-blank by Aaron Klein, he said,
[03:18:44.272 --> 03:18:48.135]  Do you believe the NSA has copies of all of Clinton's emails?
[03:18:48.135 --> 03:18:51.097]  And Benny said, yes, that would be my point.
[03:18:51.097 --> 03:18:55.281]  They have them all and the FBI can get them right there.
[03:18:55.281 --> 03:19:00.265]  Let me remind you that William Benny wasn't just an NSA employee.
[03:19:00.765 --> 03:19:03.526]  He wasn't just a high-ranking NSA employee.
[03:19:03.526 --> 03:19:09.868]  He was the head of NSA technical capabilities and had been for quite some time.
[03:19:09.868 --> 03:19:12.609]  He knows what he's talking about when he talks about the hack.
[03:19:12.609 --> 03:19:19.691]  And he also understands the frustration of people who take this stuff seriously, unlike Hillary Clinton.
[03:19:20.831 --> 03:19:27.752]  He also knows the history behind John Deutch, who was Bill Clinton's head of CIA.
[03:19:27.752 --> 03:19:33.734]  He had classified documents on his unsecured laptop.
[03:19:33.734 --> 03:19:34.854]  They took that laptop.
[03:19:34.854 --> 03:19:37.254]  He didn't get a chance to selectively delete stuff.
[03:19:37.254 --> 03:19:42.356]  He was facing jail time until Clinton pardoned him, and he lost his security clearance.
[03:19:42.356 --> 03:19:44.076]  Not so for Hillary Clinton.
[03:19:44.776 --> 03:19:46.497]  Well, I think there's a lot of people in the U.S.
[03:19:46.497 --> 03:19:53.181]  government who are going to make sure that she does lose her security clearance because they're going to make sure she doesn't become President of the United States.
[03:19:53.181 --> 03:19:53.842]  Stay with us.
[03:19:53.842 --> 03:19:56.964]  We'll be right back with more from the DNC wrap-up.
[03:19:59.949 --> 03:20:05.892]  Men, if you're like me, you appreciate the feeling of a clean, smooth shave from a quality blade.

[03:24:00.558 --> 03:24:13.877]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, fourth hour, I'm David Knight.
[03:24:14.708 --> 03:24:19.172]  Go back and look at some of the other odd things that happened at the Democrat Convention.
[03:24:19.172 --> 03:24:28.860]  Of course, we have the con job done by the Muslim Brotherhood member with connections, and that was the guy who criticized Donald Trump.
[03:24:28.860 --> 03:24:32.243]  And of course, everybody's been talking about that all weekend.
[03:24:32.243 --> 03:24:35.345]  Not really talking about the sleeper of a speech that Hillary Clinton gave.
[03:24:35.345 --> 03:24:40.390]  You know, you see those pictures of Bill Clinton dozing off and Cain trying to
[03:24:41.350 --> 03:24:53.515]  Distract attention from that as well as I get in front of him, you know, my comment on that on Twitter was I'm surprised that he's the only one that fell asleep in that group I can't believe that anybody could stay awake through that speech.
[03:24:53.515 --> 03:25:03.698]  So nobody's really talking about Hillary Clinton's speech She made sure that she wasn't going to be upstaged by anybody in the Democrat Party They had all the big hitters speaking the night before that night.
[03:25:03.698 --> 03:25:04.739]  They just had a lot of
[03:25:06.055 --> 03:25:16.847]  Various identity politics and activist candidate speaking, or spokesman speaking, but they did change their lineup and we're going to talk about that a bit.
[03:25:16.847 --> 03:25:21.092]  You know, what they did in terms of a tribute to the police.
[03:25:21.092 --> 03:25:22.854]  That was something that was not planned.
[03:25:23.334 --> 03:25:31.361]  Until the last minute, just like all these American flags that suddenly appeared on Tuesday after they were criticized for not having them on Monday.
[03:25:31.361 --> 03:25:32.682]  We'll get to that in just a moment.
[03:25:32.682 --> 03:25:43.431]  Before we get back to the news, I just want to remind you that we have extended some of the specials from our Sleeping Giant mega sales that happened last week, the 28-hour broadcast that we had.
[03:25:43.431 --> 03:25:45.874]  We had to pull most of those specials, but we do still have
[03:25:46.414 --> 03:26:02.530]  Three major products from the mega special pricing 40% off of brain force 30% off vitamin mineral mineral fusion and 30% off DNA force and we still have store wide free shipping so that is something that
[03:26:03.582 --> 03:26:04.082]  I think so.
[03:26:22.253 --> 03:26:23.133]  Supporting our operation.
[03:26:23.133 --> 03:26:27.134]  We would not be able to go to these conventions to send our reporters to these live events.
[03:26:27.134 --> 03:26:38.256]  It's very important that we get there, that we see these people firsthand, that we talk to them, interview the people who are protesting on the street, as well as being able to get access to some of the people like Jesse Jackson.
[03:26:38.256 --> 03:26:47.038]  We'll play that for you in just a moment and tell you how that fits in with the modified, at the last minute, the modified speaker lineup at the DNC.
[03:26:48.158 --> 03:26:51.920]  Before we get to that, I just want to finish up with one other thing that William Binney said.
[03:26:51.920 --> 03:26:58.463]  You know, we've got this article where he says that he believes that it could very well be somebody inside the U.S.
[03:26:58.463 --> 03:27:14.690]  intelligence community that is leaking all this information about Hillary Clinton because they're unhappy that she compromised national security, that she's not only getting away with it, but she's going to retain her security clearance and become president, okay?
[03:27:14.690 --> 03:27:15.911]  They don't want to see that happen.
[03:27:16.684 --> 03:27:20.027]  He says there's another point that he brought up in this interview with Aaron Klein.
[03:27:20.027 --> 03:27:29.617]  He said that the other point is that Hillary, according to an article published by the Observer in March of this year, has a problem with the NSA because she compromised gamma material.
[03:27:30.745 --> 03:27:33.086]  He says that's the most sensitive material at the NSA.
[03:27:33.086 --> 03:27:41.152]  So there was a number of NSA officials that were complaining to the press or to the people who wrote in that article that she compromised Gamma material.
[03:27:41.152 --> 03:27:45.074]  She lifted the material that was in her emails directly out of Gamma reporting.
[03:27:45.074 --> 03:27:46.415]  So what is Gamma?
[03:27:46.415 --> 03:27:47.636]  Okay, remember when we talked about how
[03:27:48.596 --> 03:28:05.171]  A lot of these emails are born classified because they're about discussions between top foreign leaders as well as, you know, between information that they intercepted between other foreign leaders or information about what she said to foreign leaders.
[03:28:05.171 --> 03:28:07.192]  That is born classified.
[03:28:07.933 --> 03:28:20.881]  So, when you send that, when that happens, when you're having classified discussions with a foreign government and then you're making comments about that, you don't need to wait until somebody puts a classification sticker on that.
[03:28:20.881 --> 03:28:22.361]  It's already classified.
[03:28:22.361 --> 03:28:23.522]  She should know that.
[03:28:23.522 --> 03:28:27.444]  She shouldn't have that on her private, unsecured server.
[03:28:27.444 --> 03:28:33.308]  And they point out that the gamma compartment, you know, we're talking about compartmentalization, so there's this one compartment called gamma.
[03:28:34.068 --> 03:28:38.391]  It's an NSA handling caveat applied to extraordinarily sensitive information.
[03:28:38.391 --> 03:28:43.374]  For example, decrypted conversations between top foreign leadership.
[03:28:43.374 --> 03:28:47.096]  That's the kind of stuff Hillary Clinton exposed.
[03:28:47.096 --> 03:28:47.797]  Okay?
[03:28:47.797 --> 03:28:55.821]  It's not just that she sent and received classified emails, as the FBI director said, and then gave her a pass on the criminal actions.
[03:28:55.821 --> 03:28:56.362]  No.
[03:28:56.362 --> 03:28:59.424]  She also exposed that kind of information.
[03:28:59.424 --> 03:29:02.606]  So there's a lot of people, I think, in the American government
[03:29:03.564 --> 03:29:10.426]  Who would like to see her exposed, and yet all they do is talk about the Russians.
[03:29:10.426 --> 03:29:11.787]  The Russians with Trump.
[03:29:11.787 --> 03:29:13.287]  The Russians this, the Russians that.
[03:29:13.287 --> 03:29:16.768]  Look, nobody is talking about in the mainstream press, are they?
[03:29:16.768 --> 03:29:22.250]  The connections between her campaign manager, John Podesta, and the Russians, okay?
[03:29:22.250 --> 03:29:24.991]  A Putin-connected Russian government fund.
[03:29:24.991 --> 03:29:27.832]  Gave him $35 million, okay?
[03:29:27.832 --> 03:29:31.493]  She's gotten 20% of her funding from the Saudis, they brag.
[03:29:32.373 --> 03:29:34.474]  This is the candidate.
[03:29:34.474 --> 03:29:37.676]  This is exposed in a great report from Russia with money.
[03:29:37.676 --> 03:29:40.077]  Hillary Clinton and the Russian reset.
[03:29:40.077 --> 03:29:41.038]  Cronyism.
[03:29:41.038 --> 03:29:41.798]  Stay with us.
[03:29:41.798 --> 03:29:49.242]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:49.242 --> 03:29:50.643]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.643 --> 03:29:53.164]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.164 --> 03:29:55.886]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.220 --> 03:30:02.923]  What's likely another attempt to downplay Islamic terrorism?
[03:30:02.923 --> 03:30:07.989]  London authorities covered up an attempted car bombing on Saturday night, according to a source who reached out to InfoWars.
[03:30:07.989 --> 03:30:16.379]  Camden Lock, a popular area for club goers, was evacuated by police after a report about a suspicious vehicle at 10.50pm local time, as reported by Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:30:16.499 --> 03:30:23.983]  Metropolitan Police sent in a bomb robot to check the car and sequentially announced that the vehicle was not deemed too suspicious and officers were stood down.
[03:30:23.983 --> 03:30:31.426]  However, according to an employee who works at one of the venues that was evacuated, he saw information that suggests the incident was in fact an attempted terrorist attack.
[03:30:31.426 --> 03:30:37.209]  The bomb was real, he said, adding that the device contained shrapnel and that the car was filled with gas canisters.
[03:30:37.209 --> 03:30:40.451]  Additionally, the vehicle had no registered owner and no insurance.
[03:30:40.771 --> 03:30:48.576]  The employee also said, quote, the car was parked in a very high-traffic area with busy clubs and pubs all around, including a sold-out open-air event.
[03:30:48.576 --> 03:30:50.918]  If it went off, a lot of people wouldn't have made it home that night.
[03:30:50.918 --> 03:30:53.360]  The mainstream media won't report on it, so maybe you will.
[03:30:53.360 --> 03:30:58.403]  And for more news the mainstream media won't cover out of fear of political correctness, visit Infowars.com.
[03:30:58.403 --> 03:30:59.564]  This is Keith Daniels reporting.
[03:30:59.824 --> 03:31:03.007]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[03:31:03.007 --> 03:31:05.369]  Deep Cleanse by InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:31:05.369 --> 03:31:12.395]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[03:31:27.128 --> 03:31:36.017]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[03:31:36.017 --> 03:31:43.104]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary SpiteGX herbal processing technique.

[03:31:48.590 --> 03:31:53.476]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[03:32:08.112 --> 03:32:14.893]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[03:32:14.893 --> 03:32:21.015]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[03:32:21.015 --> 03:32:24.296]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[03:32:24.296 --> 03:32:25.736]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[03:32:25.956 --> 03:32:30.278]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[03:32:30.278 --> 03:32:33.219]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[03:32:33.219 --> 03:32:34.880]  It works like an antioxidant.
[03:32:34.880 --> 03:32:38.321]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[03:32:38.321 --> 03:32:40.922]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[03:32:40.922 --> 03:32:41.983]  It's in powder form.
[03:32:41.983 --> 03:32:44.844]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[03:32:44.844 --> 03:32:45.984]  I take this.
[03:32:45.984 --> 03:32:47.385]  This is the product that I take.

[03:33:17.587 --> 03:33:20.273]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.854 --> 03:33:25.194]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:25.194 --> 03:33:26.535]  I'm David Knight in this fourth hour.
[03:33:26.535 --> 03:33:33.277]  I want to take a look at some of the other things that happened at the DNC as we were there reporting it live.
[03:33:33.277 --> 03:33:42.780]  The LA Times talks about how vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine can speak in Spanish and they ask the question, do Latino voters care?
[03:33:43.843 --> 03:33:50.610]  They point out that he got up and said in Spanish, inflected with the tones of the American Midwest.
[03:33:50.610 --> 03:34:03.022]  He spoke to the assembly there and they say his Spanish has been sold as a draw to Latino voters in election year, which the other major party's nominee, Donald Trump, said a fellow candidate speaks Mexican.
[03:34:03.022 --> 03:34:03.923]  You know what?
[03:34:03.923 --> 03:34:05.805]  Tim Kaine speaks globalism.
[03:34:06.785 --> 03:34:14.152]  I remarked about that on Twitter and somebody came back to me and said, well, you know, this happens to be a language that 37 million people in America speak.
[03:34:14.152 --> 03:34:16.975]  You know, that's still a small minority overall.
[03:34:16.975 --> 03:34:22.220]  But I came back to him and I said, well, just press Trump for English.
[03:34:22.220 --> 03:34:25.023]  Press Kaine for globalist.
[03:34:25.023 --> 03:34:25.983]  OK, that's what we have.
[03:34:25.983 --> 03:34:27.905]  Globalist and Goldman Sachs.
[03:34:27.905 --> 03:34:30.007]  That's what he really speaks.
[03:34:30.007 --> 03:34:31.308]  That's his real language, folks.
[03:34:32.210 --> 03:34:38.192]  And I think it's interesting, in this LA Times article, where they say, does anybody really care that he speaks Spanish?
[03:34:38.192 --> 03:34:46.535]  They quote a Democrat political strategist, Felix Sanchez, co-founder of the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts.
[03:34:46.535 --> 03:34:50.276]  He said, Cain's speaking Spanish is simply unnecessary.
[03:34:50.276 --> 03:34:53.657]  He says, it's a political trope that has run its course.
[03:34:53.657 --> 03:34:59.539]  I prefer to have candidates address issues, supply solutions, and then see if they can get it done.
[03:35:00.299 --> 03:35:03.840]  Instead of scripted Spanish pablum.
[03:35:03.840 --> 03:35:05.721]  See, that's precisely it.
[03:35:05.721 --> 03:35:07.361]  It's all symbolism.
[03:35:07.361 --> 03:35:08.922]  It's all tribalism.
[03:35:08.922 --> 03:35:14.264]  There are no solutions being added because what this guy is offering is globalism.
[03:35:14.264 --> 03:35:14.524]  Okay?
[03:35:14.524 --> 03:35:16.605]  That's what he's truly speaking.
[03:35:16.605 --> 03:35:19.746]  Hillary Clinton doubled down on her choice with Cain.
[03:35:20.866 --> 03:35:29.692]  Uh, instead of trying to offer an olive branch to the Bernie Sanders supporter, she doubled down on somebody that is opposed to everything they stand for, which is TPP.
[03:35:29.692 --> 03:35:33.214]  That was what we saw in the convention at the beginning.
[03:35:33.214 --> 03:35:38.838]  Monday night, especially, Tuesday night, all these people, handwritten signs that they had folded up and carried in so they could get them in.
[03:35:38.838 --> 03:35:39.719]  Most of the people had
[03:35:40.359 --> 03:35:41.820]  Pre-printed signs.
[03:35:41.820 --> 03:35:45.162]  They were told, okay, when this speaker comes out, you hold up this sign.
[03:35:45.162 --> 03:35:47.844]  When that speaker comes out, here's the sign you're all going to hold up.
[03:35:47.844 --> 03:35:52.027]  I mean, what a phony, scripted bunch of nonsense.
[03:35:52.027 --> 03:35:56.550]  But some of them brought in their own signs about what they were concerned about.
[03:35:56.550 --> 03:36:00.632]  And it was always TPP with a circle and a slash run through it.
[03:36:00.632 --> 03:36:01.153]  No TPP.
[03:36:02.352 --> 03:36:12.099]  And yet, what she did was she picked somebody who is the Wall Street candidate when it comes to globalism, when it comes to multinational corporations.
[03:36:12.099 --> 03:36:17.442]  The Wall Street Journal was talking about how excited all of these people in Wall Street were about Tim Kaine.
[03:36:17.442 --> 03:36:22.506]  They were all headed to the convention to celebrate and to buy influence, I'm sure.
[03:36:22.506 --> 03:36:24.327]  But you know, the real issue here
[03:36:25.236 --> 03:36:37.551]  And I think it's interesting, too, when they point out, they say, well, if the argument is that Cain is her choice for VP because he spoke better Spanish than Castro and Perez, well, that certainly is a red herring argument.
[03:36:37.551 --> 03:36:39.814]  Isn't it interesting that Julian Castro
[03:36:40.555 --> 03:36:43.578]  Who's the head secretary, former mayor of San Antonio.
[03:36:43.578 --> 03:36:47.441]  He's floated as her, as a leading VP choice.
[03:36:47.441 --> 03:36:53.867]  He started taking Spanish lessons so he could speak better Spanish because of the pandering.
[03:36:53.867 --> 03:36:57.450]  Again, you know, all you have to do is speak fluent globalism.
[03:36:58.229 --> 03:37:06.392]  And I thought it was interesting that Castro, whose mother was one of the founders of La Raza, didn't speak that fluent Spanish.
[03:37:06.392 --> 03:37:10.674]  But look, you have to understand why they are pushing this out.
[03:37:10.674 --> 03:37:20.318]  And you also have to understand, before I move on to what happened in North Carolina with the voter law, another observation I saw when I was there, one of the minor speakers that was there,
[03:37:21.543 --> 03:37:28.708]  Uh, was speaking and just threw out a phrase in Spanish, a token phrase, just like Cain did.
[03:37:28.708 --> 03:37:36.032]  And it was interesting because he threw that out, and he kind of waited as an applause line, and he got crickets.
[03:37:36.032 --> 03:37:39.234]  And then he said it in English, and he got applause.
[03:37:39.234 --> 03:37:41.536]  And I thought, that's kind of interesting.
[03:37:41.536 --> 03:37:49.141]  Because I don't know if these people here, who love to tout their diversity, just as we see with Julian Castro, do they really speak Spanish?
[03:37:50.216 --> 03:37:53.017]  You know, there's a reason people speak English.
[03:37:53.017 --> 03:37:58.479]  If you want to get ahead in this contemporary world, you want to be able to speak English.
[03:37:58.479 --> 03:38:04.321]  Because English is the lingua franca of the 21st century folks, like it or not.
[03:38:04.321 --> 03:38:08.962]  It's been Latin in the past, it's been French in the past, today it is English.
[03:38:08.962 --> 03:38:17.905]  If you want to get ahead, if you want the universal language that everybody seeks, when we went to Copenhagen to cover Bilderberg, all the signs were up in Danish as well as in English.
[03:38:19.053 --> 03:38:20.814]  Really kind of strange.
[03:38:20.814 --> 03:38:23.516]  And sometimes there would only be an English sign up.
[03:38:23.516 --> 03:38:24.537]  They wouldn't have Danish there.
[03:38:24.537 --> 03:38:26.579]  There was a guy ahead of us in line who was German.
[03:38:26.579 --> 03:38:30.121]  He was very upset that there weren't any signs in German.
[03:38:30.121 --> 03:38:33.624]  He said, they used to teach German in the Danish schools here.
[03:38:33.624 --> 03:38:35.445]  He was arguing with the waiter in front of me.
[03:38:35.445 --> 03:38:37.867]  He said something to him in German and the waiter didn't understand it.
[03:38:37.867 --> 03:38:38.988]  So he's kind of upset about that.
[03:38:38.988 --> 03:38:39.128]  Look.
[03:38:40.745 --> 03:38:48.972]  You have to understand the point of language is communication, and we need to try to have a common communication so that we can all speak together.
[03:38:48.972 --> 03:38:52.315]  That's especially important in government.
[03:38:52.315 --> 03:38:59.262]  There's enough argument about what the clearly written Constitution says amongst English speakers, okay?
[03:39:00.299 --> 03:39:08.106]  And so there's a lot of prevarication that goes along with that, and it's going to be even worse if we start having multiple languages in government.
[03:39:08.106 --> 03:39:23.378]  And when I look at this court decision striking down North Carolina voter ID law, this was reported from Politico, if you remember, a couple of years ago, they passed a law in North Carolina saying that you would have to show a picture ID when you vote.
[03:39:24.366 --> 03:39:36.618]  And I reported at the last election, my brother-in-law told me that a friend of his told him he went to vote, and in North Carolina to vote, all you do is you show up, you give them your name and your address, they look in their book and they say, okay, here it is.
[03:39:36.618 --> 03:39:38.560]  He went to vote and they said, well, you've already voted.
[03:39:38.560 --> 03:39:40.181]  He said, no, I haven't.
[03:39:40.181 --> 03:39:44.466]  He said, yeah, you have, and the other person at your address has already voted.
[03:39:44.466 --> 03:39:46.167]  He goes, that's my mother.
[03:39:46.167 --> 03:39:46.648]  She's dead.
[03:39:47.898 --> 03:39:54.503]  Now, he didn't make an issue of that, he didn't go to the press, he didn't want to come on and talk with us on the record.
[03:39:54.503 --> 03:39:56.785]  But look folks, that happens.
[03:39:56.785 --> 03:39:59.768]  There's a reason that you have photo ID.
[03:39:59.768 --> 03:40:00.728]  Okay?
[03:40:00.728 --> 03:40:06.293]  Is it racist when the TSA asks to see your photo ID before they'll let you get on a plane?
[03:40:07.890 --> 03:40:13.512]  Is it a problem when you have to show photo ID when you cash a check, okay?
[03:40:13.512 --> 03:40:16.334]  Is it racist for the DNC to ask for your photo ID?
[03:40:16.334 --> 03:40:20.696]  They were checking our ID everywhere, all the time, different areas we would go into.
[03:40:20.696 --> 03:40:27.359]  Every time we'd go into another inner circle of Dante's Inferno, we would have to show them our ID again, okay?
[03:40:28.559 --> 03:40:29.760]  Is that racist?
[03:40:29.760 --> 03:40:38.609]  If it is, then the DNC is racist, the TSA is racist, your grocery store is racist when you have to show your ID to cash a check.
[03:40:38.609 --> 03:40:52.883]  But we've got three judges, two of them Obama judges, one of them a Clinton judge, and they unanimously said that it's racist to have to show a picture to verify your ID if you vote because it's North Carolina.
[03:40:54.082 --> 03:40:55.643]  Okay, that's essentially what they're saying.
[03:40:55.643 --> 03:40:56.703]  They said this.
[03:40:56.703 --> 03:41:07.808]  They said the General Assembly enacted these photo ID laws in the immediate aftermath of unprecedented African-American voter participation in a state with a troubled racial history and racially polarized voting.
[03:41:07.808 --> 03:41:08.929]  Let me tell you something.
[03:41:08.929 --> 03:41:14.251]  There was no immediate aftermath of an unprecedented African-American voter participation.
[03:41:14.251 --> 03:41:15.032]  That's total baloney.
[03:41:16.058 --> 03:41:21.401]  And they overturned a lower court Fourth Circuit ruling by U.S.
[03:41:21.401 --> 03:41:24.462]  District Court Judge Thomas Schroeder.
[03:41:24.462 --> 03:41:31.806]  A mammoth, 485-page decision that he wrote just in April, upholding the North Carolina law.
[03:41:31.806 --> 03:41:33.046]  They struck that down.
[03:41:33.046 --> 03:41:35.467]  They said, racist, and you can't do this.
[03:41:35.467 --> 03:41:40.190]  And of course, there's no time, folks, for this to be appealed before the Supreme Court.
[03:41:41.230 --> 03:41:57.717]  So you see, when we're looking at Cain and Hillary Clinton is trying to get somebody who is going to speak some token Spanish in a Midwestern accent, okay, it's about appealing to voters, and I would say this, illegal voters, that she wants to bring into this country.
[03:41:58.297 --> 03:42:00.920]  That's one of the ways she's going to rig this election.
[03:42:00.920 --> 03:42:03.242]  That's why they're pushing back on this North Carolina law.
[03:42:03.242 --> 03:42:09.028]  It has absolutely nothing to do with some imaginary surge of black voters participating.
[03:42:09.028 --> 03:42:13.713]  It has everything to do with making sure that illegal aliens are not voting illegally.
[03:42:14.781 --> 03:42:17.603]  And to make sure that people don't vote multiple times.
[03:42:17.603 --> 03:42:31.851]  You have a long period of time people can show up, and all they have to do is go to the phone book, if such a thing still exists anywhere, but all they have to do is look up people's names and addresses and you can go in and vote for those people before they show up.
[03:42:31.851 --> 03:42:33.452]  And that's precisely what happened to our friend.
[03:42:33.452 --> 03:42:40.717]  Now one of the other things I think was interesting in the convention, and I reported on this on Friday before we went,
[03:42:41.747 --> 03:42:55.020]  On Thursday, John McNesby, who was president of the Fraternal Order of Police there in Philadelphia, said he was shocked and saddened by the planned choice of speakers at the Democrat convention that was going to start the following Monday in Philadelphia.
[03:42:55.020 --> 03:42:58.084]  He said the Fraternal Order of Police is insulted and will not soon forget
[03:42:58.704 --> 03:43:08.986]  The Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton are excluding the widows and other family members of police officers killed in the line of duty who were victims of explicit, not implied, racism.
[03:43:08.986 --> 03:43:17.108]  In other words, they were going to let families of blacks who'd been killed by police speak, but they were not going to have any family members of police who had been killed.
[03:43:17.108 --> 03:43:21.309]  I want to play this clip from Jesse Jackson in just a moment, but he goes on to say,
[03:43:22.229 --> 03:43:25.413]  It's sad to win an election.
[03:43:25.413 --> 03:43:37.906]  It's sad that in order to win an election, Mrs. Clinton must pander to the interests of people who don't know all the facts, while the men and women that they destroy are outside protecting the political institutions of this country.
[03:43:37.906 --> 03:43:42.650]  In other words, while you are demonizing us in the Democrat convention.
[03:43:43.351 --> 03:43:45.432]  We're going to be outside protecting you.
[03:43:45.432 --> 03:43:46.633]  That's what he was saying.
[03:43:46.633 --> 03:43:52.856]  He said, Mrs. Clinton, you should be ashamed of yourself if that's possible.
[03:43:52.856 --> 03:43:58.459]  Well, I don't think she did it out of shame, but it was interesting because that was done on Thursday.
[03:43:58.459 --> 03:43:59.459]  I reported that on Friday.
[03:43:59.459 --> 03:44:04.122]  We go there Monday night on the floor of the DNC.
[03:44:04.122 --> 03:44:08.244]  I talked to Jesse Jackson and here's what he had to say when I raised that issue to him.
[03:44:10.998 --> 03:44:12.860]  I wish we could share the pain of both.
[03:44:12.860 --> 03:44:14.201]  Because those who were shot unarmed
[03:44:32.068 --> 03:44:33.108]  Did nothing to be killed.
[03:44:33.108 --> 03:44:36.369]  And the police were shot unarmed, did nothing to be killed.
[03:44:36.369 --> 03:44:39.230]  That must be some common commitment to stop the killing.
[03:44:39.230 --> 03:44:47.891]  I think that for a season, from Trayvon Martin to Michael Brown to Diallo, he was blackmailed and killed by police.
[03:44:47.891 --> 03:44:53.392]  The killing of police by people, by two veterans I might add, is a recent thing.
[03:44:53.392 --> 03:44:58.033]  But I hope that can be an appreciation for the pain and unnecessary loss of both sides.
[03:44:58.033 --> 03:45:00.114]  Do you think that they should have them speak?
[03:45:01.154 --> 03:45:06.657]  Do you think they should have had someone from the families that have just recently had the most recent shootings in Dallas?
[03:45:06.657 --> 03:45:08.318]  They may make those adjustments.
[03:45:08.318 --> 03:45:09.638]  I hope that they will.
[03:45:09.638 --> 03:45:09.898]  Thank you.
[03:45:13.459 --> 03:45:15.460]  So he said, they may make that adjustment.
[03:45:15.460 --> 03:45:16.200]  I hope they will.
[03:45:16.200 --> 03:45:17.560]  And they did.
[03:45:17.560 --> 03:45:25.342]  Just like they made an adjustment on the second night when they were criticized the first night for not having any American flags on stage.
[03:45:25.342 --> 03:45:27.603]  They went out and got some flags.
[03:45:27.603 --> 03:45:34.185]  Daily Call reported that they had two employees from City Hall tell them that they got those flags from City Hall at the last minute.
[03:45:34.185 --> 03:45:40.146]  And just like the beard of putting those flags out there, they weren't concerned about that when they were thinking about their convention.
[03:45:40.146 --> 03:45:41.647]  It was an afterthought, okay?
[03:45:42.327 --> 03:45:45.208]  And they used the police as a beard.
[03:45:45.208 --> 03:45:54.591]  Later on, what they did was they brought in, they added the Dallas Police Chief, they added a section there, a tribute to fallen heroes to talk about the police.
[03:45:54.591 --> 03:45:56.332]  So that was not something that they wanted to do.
[03:45:56.332 --> 03:46:00.453]  They only did it because they were criticized.
[03:46:00.453 --> 03:46:01.354]  You have to understand that.
[03:46:02.194 --> 03:46:06.917]  And that's the way these guys have rolled, and I think it's very interesting that they would do that.
[03:46:06.917 --> 03:46:12.420]  I think it's also, we put that Jesse Jackson was race-baiting because you notice the cases that he talked about.
[03:46:12.420 --> 03:46:18.183]  Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, he didn't talk about the clear-cut cases of excessive police force.
[03:46:18.723 --> 03:46:26.867]  He talked about the ones that were not clear-cut, the ones that were, in the case of Trayvon Martin, they had jury trials, they said he acted in self-defense.
[03:46:26.867 --> 03:46:32.689]  They always like to throw up the ones that are the most controversial, because that is part of the race-baiting.
[03:46:32.689 --> 03:46:36.271]  And he also threw out there, oh, by the way, these guys were veterans, okay?
[03:46:36.271 --> 03:46:41.153]  In other words, distancing the idea that they were motivated by Black Lives Matter.
[03:46:41.153 --> 03:46:43.914]  That's why we put that title up there, that he was race-baiting.
[03:46:44.454 --> 03:46:49.336]  We've seen that kind of spin on this information from day one.
[03:46:49.336 --> 03:46:51.277]  So they added them at the last minute.
[03:46:51.277 --> 03:46:53.238]  They added the police to speak.
[03:46:53.238 --> 03:46:58.360]  They also decided that they would go full-on with the military.
[03:46:58.360 --> 03:47:05.723]  And Reason Magazine says you can watch the scariest speech from both the RNC and the DNC.
[03:47:05.723 --> 03:47:08.664]  It's John Allen's unrestrained warmongering.
[03:47:10.922 --> 03:47:12.828]  How does this help her with Bernie Sanders supporters?
[03:47:12.828 --> 03:47:14.152]  Again, it's like she did with...
[03:47:15.259 --> 03:47:15.639]  We're good.
[03:47:45.342 --> 03:47:47.424]  Had absolutely nothing to say about it.
[03:47:47.424 --> 03:47:51.086]  And of course the mainstream media had absolutely nothing to say about what he was doing.
[03:47:51.086 --> 03:47:55.810]  But here's what was said about this in Foreign Policy magazine.
[03:47:55.810 --> 03:47:58.231]  This is Duke University's Peter Feaver.
[03:47:58.231 --> 03:48:06.878]  He said, for my money, the absolute lowest point was when Allen explicitly called on the active uniformed military to join in a political campaign.
[03:48:06.878 --> 03:48:09.580]  He said, every American in uniform in the White House or at home
[03:48:10.160 --> 03:48:20.629]  And they all chanted, USA, USA, and of course, there were people there that turned around and said, shut up, USA is a Trump slogan.
[03:48:20.629 --> 03:48:21.510]  Don't say that.
[03:48:21.510 --> 03:48:22.410]  Anyway, they shouted USA.
[03:48:22.410 --> 03:48:30.317]  He says, we must be a force, people in uniform, must be a force for unity in America, for a vision that includes all of us, all of us.
[03:48:30.317 --> 03:48:37.883]  And the comment of Fever, he said, it's hard to craft a more politicized call for the military to join in partisan politics than that.
[03:48:38.624 --> 03:48:46.049]  And it's hard to find a bigger stage from which to make such a disturbing appeal than just before the candidate accepts her nomination.
[03:48:46.049 --> 03:48:46.649]  Okay?
[03:48:46.649 --> 03:48:50.091]  Now, understand who this guy is.
[03:48:50.091 --> 03:48:53.654]  John Allen, do you remember going back to the Petraeus leaks?
[03:48:53.654 --> 03:49:01.359]  That he was accused of sending a lot of racy, sexually charged emails to socialite Jill Kelly?
[03:49:01.359 --> 03:49:03.000]  This is somebody who was
[03:49:05.083 --> 03:49:10.407]  Uh, spoken of as the honorary ambassador to CENTCOM, to Central Command there in Florida.
[03:49:10.407 --> 03:49:15.812]  She was used by foreign governments to gain access to Central Command senior generals.
[03:49:15.812 --> 03:49:19.134]  And a lot of those foreign governments, most of them, were Middle Eastern governments.
[03:49:19.134 --> 03:49:22.077]  This is a lady who was born in Lebanon, okay?
[03:49:22.077 --> 03:49:24.098]  They did a Pentagon investigation at the time.
[03:49:24.098 --> 03:49:25.780]  Twenty to thirty thousand pages of emails.
[03:49:26.420 --> 03:49:30.281]  Isn't it interesting that these emails always come in groups of 30,000?
[03:49:30.281 --> 03:49:34.783]  I'm beginning to get suspicious about these figures that they're throwing out.
[03:49:34.783 --> 03:49:36.383]  They always have 30-some-odd thousand.
[03:49:36.383 --> 03:49:40.985]  I guess that's just the number beyond which they can't count, okay?
[03:49:40.985 --> 03:49:44.946]  They've eventually said that he did not violate anything.
[03:49:44.946 --> 03:49:49.727]  She was described as the other woman, and she was accused of many things since the scandal erupted.
[03:49:49.727 --> 03:49:50.668]  Interestingly enough,
[03:49:51.608 --> 03:50:05.398]  She accused Paula Broadwell, the broad that Petraeus was exchanging emails with, the thing that got him busted out of his position, she accused Paula Broadwell of trying to blackmail her.
[03:50:05.398 --> 03:50:10.101]  And I guess the question is, you know, what did she have to blackmail her with?
[03:50:10.101 --> 03:50:11.783]  What did she want in exchange?
[03:50:12.574 --> 03:50:17.516]  Because this is a person who was acting as a go-between with a lot of these Middle Eastern governments.
[03:50:17.516 --> 03:50:19.097]  Okay, now, who is John Allen?
[03:50:19.097 --> 03:50:22.539]  Well, he was the guy that was exchanging emails with a socialite.
[03:50:22.539 --> 03:50:26.881]  And he was somebody who was the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan.
[03:50:26.881 --> 03:50:31.383]  He had been nominated to become Supreme Allied Commander of NATO in Europe.
[03:50:32.023 --> 03:50:39.226]  They put that on hold while they investigated him and eventually he stepped down to say that he was going to retire.
[03:50:39.226 --> 03:50:40.647]  Now he hasn't retired.
[03:50:40.647 --> 03:50:47.010]  He continues to show up at places like David Petraeus, places like the Bilderberg Group where he was in 2015.
[03:50:49.091 --> 03:50:50.971]  Okay, he has stayed connected.
[03:50:50.971 --> 03:50:57.693]  Perhaps, I guess, he feels that if he gets into the Clinton administration, nobody will really pay any attention to his naughty emails.
[03:50:57.693 --> 03:50:59.453]  He's going to look like a Boy Scout in that group.
[03:50:59.453 --> 03:51:00.614]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:51:00.614 --> 03:51:08.676]  ExtendoVite, a 7-herb combination of garlic, cayenne, hawthorn, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, valerian, and milk thistle.
[03:51:08.676 --> 03:51:13.537]  ExtendoVite is designed to strengthen the heart and arteries and help the body heal itself.
[03:51:14.457 --> 03:51:20.482]  Doctors are not able to explain the improvements they are seeing in their patients' health who are taking ExtendoVite.
[03:51:20.482 --> 03:51:25.186]  People who once needed more pills are now taking less and getting better.
[03:51:25.186 --> 03:51:32.172]  Due to the unexplainable improvements in their patients' health, more doctors are calling to order ExtendoVite for themselves.
[03:51:32.913 --> 03:51:35.635]  Help XtendoVite make your doctor a believer.
[03:51:35.635 --> 03:51:41.119]  XtendoVite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a two-month supply.

[03:52:59.900 --> 03:53:03.682]  Dr. Water Warburg won the Nobel Prize for discovering how cells breathe.
[03:53:03.682 --> 03:53:06.583]  He also discovered how normal cells turned into tumor cells.
[03:53:06.583 --> 03:53:10.464]  He discovered the one prime cause of cancer was cellular oxygen deficiency.
[03:53:10.464 --> 03:53:17.247]  Dr. Joanna Budwig built upon the work of Dr. Warburg and discovered how to feed the cells to overcome this oxygen deficiency.
[03:53:17.247 --> 03:53:24.570]  She found that it was the sulfur in the cottage cheese that would mix with fresh pressed flax oil that the flax oil would become emulsified and more readily absorbed.
[03:53:24.890 --> 03:53:30.054]  Flax oil delivered in this manner was able to restore oxygen transfer to all cells of the body.
[03:53:30.054 --> 03:53:36.178]  Now there's a new method of pressing seed oils that produces the highest quality, zero oxidation, undamaged seed oils.
[03:53:36.178 --> 03:53:38.860]  The results on these seed oils alone are amazing.
[03:53:38.860 --> 03:53:49.287]  Now add our Life Force Enhanced One World Whey Protein Powder that is much higher in the sulfur amino acids than cottage cheese is and you have a winning combination to confer health and energy like never before.
[03:53:49.787 --> 03:53:55.498]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit sacredseedoils.com.
[03:53:55.498 --> 03:53:57.302]  That's sacredseedoils.com.
[03:54:11.016 --> 03:54:12.137]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:12.137 --> 03:54:18.661]  In this last segment, I want to talk a little bit about the wrath of Khan that is happening in the aftermath of the Democrat Convention.
[03:54:18.661 --> 03:54:23.003]  Of course, that would be Qazir Khan, the guy who criticized Donald Trump.
[03:54:23.003 --> 03:54:24.584]  Who is this man?
[03:54:24.584 --> 03:54:25.665]  What is his background?
[03:54:25.665 --> 03:54:26.706]  What is his agenda?
[03:54:26.706 --> 03:54:28.206]  How is he being used by the DNC?
[03:54:28.206 --> 03:54:30.228]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to remind you, however,
[03:54:30.868 --> 03:54:34.550]  That we have extended as a thank you to those of you who have supported our operation.
[03:54:34.550 --> 03:54:44.335]  We've extended some of the items that were part of our Sleeping Giant Mega Sale that was the 28-hour broadcast that we did last Wednesday through Thursday.
[03:54:44.335 --> 03:54:47.376]  We've extended that sale on Brain Force 40% off.
[03:54:48.857 --> 03:54:52.039]  On Vitamin Mineral Fusion, 30% off.
[03:54:52.039 --> 03:54:54.220]  On DNA Force, 30% off.
[03:54:54.220 --> 03:54:55.982]  And that's a big savings on DNA Force.
[03:54:55.982 --> 03:54:57.402]  That is a premium product.
[03:54:57.402 --> 03:54:59.203]  Very expensive to produce.
[03:54:59.203 --> 03:55:04.127]  We try to offer it at the lowest price we can, but it is still an expensive product.
[03:55:04.127 --> 03:55:07.689]  So when you get 30% off DNA Force, that is a huge sale.
[03:55:07.689 --> 03:55:10.530]  And also we have store-wide free shipping.
[03:55:10.530 --> 03:55:12.712]  Store-wide free shipping on everything.
[03:55:13.152 --> 03:55:15.152]  Take advantage of this before that disappears.
[03:55:15.152 --> 03:55:17.173]  And again, we thank you for your support.
[03:55:17.173 --> 03:55:21.974]  40% off Brain Force, 30% off Vitamin Mineral Fusion, and 30% off DNA Force.
[03:55:21.974 --> 03:55:24.134]  We have continued just those two.
[03:55:24.134 --> 03:55:25.935]  We're going to have to pull those down pretty soon.
[03:55:25.935 --> 03:55:29.275]  Find that at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:55:29.275 --> 03:55:31.716]  Now, who is this guy, Kazeer Khan, okay?
[03:55:31.716 --> 03:55:34.957]  He had a son who was killed, and he spoke at the convention.
[03:55:34.957 --> 03:55:38.497]  Again, they wanted to appeal to the police, to the military on that last night.
[03:55:38.497 --> 03:55:41.058]  They wanted to make sure that they had a lot of people
[03:55:42.076 --> 03:55:45.700]  Who are identity politics, activists, and so forth.
[03:55:45.700 --> 03:55:48.603]  No major speakers to compete with Hillary Clinton.
[03:55:49.329 --> 03:55:54.331]  You had Governor Cuomo speaking, but that was much earlier, way early in the evening.
[03:55:54.331 --> 03:55:57.032]  They didn't want to have anybody there that was going to upstage her.
[03:55:57.032 --> 03:56:04.755]  But the person who did upstage her was this Qazir Khan fellow, because of the back and forth between he and Donald Trump.
[03:56:04.755 --> 03:56:11.858]  Now, he goes on to say that if restrictions on Muslim immigration had been in place decades ago, he said, I would have not been here.
[03:56:11.858 --> 03:56:14.479]  None of my family would have been here, okay?
[03:56:14.479 --> 03:56:15.800]  We would have never been in America.
[03:56:15.800 --> 03:56:16.300]  Well, you know what?
[03:56:17.130 --> 03:56:22.394]  Your son, if it was up to Donald Trump, would never have been in Iraq.
[03:56:22.394 --> 03:56:24.135]  He would have never been killed.
[03:56:24.135 --> 03:56:28.338]  It was Hillary Clinton who wanted your son in that kind of a war theater.
[03:56:28.338 --> 03:56:40.606]  As we just pointed out in the last segment, getting John Allen out there to be one of the scariest warmongers at either convention, and again, bringing the military in in a very partisan way.
[03:56:40.606 --> 03:56:41.807]  But who is this guy?
[03:56:41.807 --> 03:56:45.990]  Okay, is he just some guy that they happen to read his essay and bring him in?
[03:56:47.604 --> 03:56:56.451]  No, he's got a long background as a matter of fact and there's some investigative reports on the American Thinker as well as Shoebat showing where this guy's from.
[03:56:56.451 --> 03:57:04.758]  First thing American Thinker noticed was that this guy had a New York City address but he had a DC phone number.
[03:57:04.758 --> 03:57:08.201]  And so they started looking at that, they called the phone number, they said, well,
[03:57:09.669 --> 03:57:10.790]  I was surprised he'd have a D.C.
[03:57:10.790 --> 03:57:20.595]  phone number with a New York City address, so he called it to see who it was, and they said, no, this isn't his law office, but the man who answered it said he would not tell him who it was.
[03:57:20.595 --> 03:57:27.718]  Then he looked up to see the domain name, and yeah, that website, it was registered to him, and it was registered very recently.
[03:57:27.718 --> 03:57:29.379]  Okay?
[03:57:29.379 --> 03:57:34.582]  Then they take a look at his connections to Islam.
[03:57:35.458 --> 03:57:37.079]  To Sharia law.
[03:57:37.079 --> 03:57:38.300]  To the Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:57:38.300 --> 03:57:40.702]  This is some research that was done by Shoebat.com.
[03:57:40.702 --> 03:57:43.864]  They say, well, the media is not telling you about the Muslim who attacked Donald Trump.
[03:57:43.864 --> 03:57:50.208]  He is a Muslim Brotherhood agent who wants to advance Sharia law and bring Muslims into the United States.
[03:57:50.208 --> 03:57:56.172]  They point out, and they show a document there, a juristic classification of Islamic law that he ran through.
[03:57:56.172 --> 03:58:04.938]  Okay, his fascination with Islamic law isn't the only issue, because at the part, at the bottom, where he references his understanding of what
[03:58:05.858 --> 03:58:07.119]  Sharia law is.
[03:58:07.119 --> 03:58:16.705]  He references Saeed Ramadan, who's head of the Islamic Center, one of the people who have been, he's a founder and hero of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:58:16.705 --> 03:58:19.366]  Look, this guy is holding up a pocket constitution.
[03:58:19.366 --> 03:58:23.089]  Of course, that became a bestseller on Amazon.com.
[03:58:23.089 --> 03:58:24.890]  He's not about the Constitution, folks.
[03:58:24.890 --> 03:58:31.774]  This guy is really about Sharia law, but he knows maybe some of the liberals will grab a pocket constitution and actually read it.
[03:58:32.114 --> 03:58:36.182]  They won't find anything in there about the right to immigration.
[03:58:36.182 --> 03:58:38.847]  Join us tonight on the Nightly News, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:38.847 --> 03:58:39.147]  Eastern.
