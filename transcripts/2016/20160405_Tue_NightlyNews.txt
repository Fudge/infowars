[00:00:26.021 --> 00:00:27.803]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:27.863 --> 00:00:31.446]  It is Tuesday, April 5th, 2016, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:31.486 --> 00:00:32.587]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.953]  Tonight, the party is choosing a nominee.
[00:00:39.313 --> 00:00:41.315]  And if you don't like it, sit down.
[00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:51.705]  That's the message to the American people from the Republican National Committee chairman, who is working with the establishment to steal Donald Trump's election.
[00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:58.367]  Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders is gaining momentum, but is it enough to pull out a win in Wisconsin?
[00:00:58.687 --> 00:01:07.749]  Regardless of what happens tonight, the Sanders campaign believes they will finally win the nomination at a contested convention this summer.
[00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.030]  Plus, the Panama Papers.
[00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.350]  Global corruption of the financial elite.
[00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.492]  But why are the leaked documents targeting regimes that the elite want to destabilize?
[00:01:20.052 --> 00:01:25.701]  And why is the mainstream media spinning the Panama Papers to the elite's advantage?
[00:01:26.222 --> 00:01:30.588]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:03:08.237 --> 00:03:11.178]  Well, the polls will be closing in Wisconsin in about an hour.
[00:03:11.218 --> 00:03:12.738]  We'll be going live at 8 p.m.
[00:03:12.778 --> 00:03:13.919]  David Knight will be joining me.
[00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.140]  We're going to see what happens there in the Wisconsin primary.
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.460]  Will Trump hit a wall?
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.361]  Will Cruz see the boost he needs?
[00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:23.542]  And will Bernie Sanders get the win he needs?
[00:03:23.582 --> 00:03:28.523]  Those delegates that will help to close the race between he and Hillary.
[00:03:28.823 --> 00:03:31.844]  People are already saying, hey, Bernie, you can't win due to the math.
[00:03:31.984 --> 00:03:37.606]  Of course, we're not hearing that on the other side of the fence for those impossible odds for the GOP candidates.
[00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:48.515]  Now, the Republican National Committee Chairman, he came out to say, you know what, listen, if you don't like the fact that it's the party that's choosing the candidate, well sit down and get out of the party.
[00:03:48.555 --> 00:03:59.966]  This is, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, and he cautioned the supporters of Donald Trump who are vocally disapproving of the GOP's delegate allocation and selection process.
[00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:06.152]  And once again saying it's the party choosing the nominee for the Republican Party.
[00:04:06.172 --> 00:04:07.614]  If you don't like it, sit down.
[00:04:08.294 --> 00:04:12.479]  And he once again says he doesn't think that Trump is going to run as a third party candidate.
[00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.825]  And he adds that he expects all remaining Republican candidates to support whoever the party's nominee is.
[00:04:19.486 --> 00:04:21.546]  I for one really hope that that doesn't happen.
[00:04:22.287 --> 00:04:25.847]  I hope Trump gets very angry and runs a third party.
[00:04:26.167 --> 00:04:33.349]  And frankly, I would like to see Sanders run third party as well and just watch this whole two-party system crash and burn.
[00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:42.811]  So like I said, we'll be going a little bit longer tonight just to make sure that we can see that those tallies as they come in because this is a pretty important night in Wisconsin.
[00:04:43.942 --> 00:04:50.028]  Now we have finally heard today just exactly how Trump is going to make Mexico pay for that wall.
[00:04:50.608 --> 00:05:02.559]  He sent out a memo to the Washington Post outlining his proposal and he threatened to cut off the flow of billions of dollars in payments that immigrants send home to the country.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.822]  And so this is, he's saying he's going to block money transfers to force Mexico to fund the border wall.
[00:05:09.262 --> 00:05:13.183]  And many economists say that this is vital for Mexico's economy.
[00:05:13.683 --> 00:05:19.745]  And Trump said he's going to do this by changing a rule under the USA Patriot Act anti-terrorism law.
[00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:26.007]  It'll cut off a portion of the funds sent to Mexico through money transfers, commonly known as remittances.
[00:05:26.587 --> 00:05:33.713]  The threat would be withdrawn if Mexico made a one-time payment of $5-10 billion to pay for the border wall.
[00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:40.979]  And after the wall is funded, then the transfer payments could continue to flow into their country year after year.
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.942]  Just to put it in perspective, nearly $25 billion was sent home
[00:05:45.783 --> 00:05:45.923]  Yes.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.341]  Pay the extraordinary daily cost of a lot of the criminal activity.
[00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:07.662]  So here he is making his deals, doing his big deals.
[00:06:07.702 --> 00:06:10.743]  He says, we have the moral high ground and all the leverage.
[00:06:10.883 --> 00:06:13.504]  So we'll have to see how that plays out.
[00:06:13.944 --> 00:06:22.227]  And another thing that was just announced today, and pretty interesting that it was announced today with the Wisconsin primaries, considering that Wisconsin
[00:06:22.947 --> 00:06:23.027]  It's
[00:06:44.992 --> 00:06:45.992]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:07:08.738 --> 00:07:12.999]  Now something else that we've been hearing a lot about this week is the Panama Papers.
[00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:21.502]  Now these were released, a treasure trove of data, released on Sunday by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
[00:07:22.022 --> 00:07:26.683]  And if you take a look at the website, these papers were given to some journalists about a year ago.
[00:07:27.103 --> 00:07:32.305]  So you can see they put together this nifty little website where you can go and look at all the little
[00:07:32.805 --> 00:07:33.887]  Thank you for having me.
[00:07:50.487 --> 00:07:53.049]  And, of course, the Justice Department says, you know, we've looked at that.
[00:07:53.109 --> 00:07:55.931]  We're investigating whether we can pursue any prosecutions.
[00:07:56.371 --> 00:08:05.898]  And they say the Justice Department takes very seriously all credible allegations of high-level foreign corruption that might have a link to the U.S.
[00:08:06.178 --> 00:08:06.719]  or the U.S.
[00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:07.459]  financial system.
[00:08:07.499 --> 00:08:17.386]  So, yeah, sure, they take it very seriously if it's foreign corruption, because you'll see that noticeably missing from these Panama Papers is any major U.S.
[00:08:17.446 --> 00:08:17.967]  players.
[00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:28.915]  And so Kurt Nimmo wrote an article up on Infowars.com, do a little bit of investigating on this international consortium of investigative journalists.
[00:08:29.595 --> 00:08:37.882]  And you can see that they are funded by the Soros and Ford Foundation, as well as a lot of other organizations.
[00:08:38.162 --> 00:08:44.266]  So basically we have the financial elite hijacking this investigative journalism to specifically attack Putin.
[00:08:45.287 --> 00:08:45.767]  Putin isn't
[00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:06.459]  The Soros Foundation, the Ford Foundation, they are behind it.
[00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:14.328]  But as well, the corporate media, the Guardian, BBC in the UK, they have exclusive access to the database which you and I cannot see.
[00:09:14.728 --> 00:09:19.634]  So they're protecting themselves from even seeing the Western corporation's sensitive information.
[00:09:20.374 --> 00:09:26.380]  So you can't look at the documents which were brought up unless you have specific search terms for them.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:38.872]  And of course, as we know, they're going to protect any of their Western partners because, as you'll recall, it's those very same corporations that own all the media that is supposedly putting out these papers.
[00:09:39.272 --> 00:09:42.774]  And so they're using it, of course, to push their own agenda.
[00:09:43.474 --> 00:09:54.559]  And let's not forget, just a couple weeks ago, a top German journalist came out admitting that most of the news the media puts out is completely fake, that they all lie for the CIA.
[00:09:55.119 --> 00:10:02.642]  And of course, I saw this on Vigilant Citizen this morning, how mass media is spinning the Panama Papers to the elite's advantage.
[00:10:03.083 --> 00:10:03.963]  Very good article.
[00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:05.744]  I highly recommend that you read it.
[00:10:06.244 --> 00:10:22.070]  But it goes on to point out that although this leak reveals a gigantic system of global corruption around the world, it curiously names very few powerful figures in the U.S., but mostly just outsiders who are part of regimes that the U.S.
[00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.150]  would like to take out.
[00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:28.432]  So that's very clear the agenda that's there, while of course it doesn't name
[00:10:28.792 --> 00:10:36.754]  Any organizations like that are involved in the Council on Foreign Relations or the Trilateral Commission, who we know are really doing these deals.
[00:10:37.234 --> 00:10:51.778]  So according to the website, the main countries involved, Argentina, Georgia, Iceland, Iraq, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Ukraine, Russia, China, Syria, Palestine, Greece, and a little bit of the UK.
[00:10:52.498 --> 00:10:56.479]  And you know, but again, what do you expect because the biggest scammers in the world
[00:10:57.079 --> 00:11:01.341]  He also happened to own the newspapers that leaked these Panama Papers.
[00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:02.922]  So we'll definitely have more on that.
[00:11:03.262 --> 00:11:05.723]  Now John McAfee is of course running for U.S.
[00:11:05.803 --> 00:11:08.185]  President as a member of the Libertarian Party.
[00:11:08.545 --> 00:11:12.027]  And he says a time bomb is hidden beneath the Panama Papers.
[00:11:12.387 --> 00:11:23.993]  The hack of Mossack Fonseca, in terms of the certain fallout that will affect many of the wealthiest and most prominent people on the planet, is by far the largest and most damaging cyber attack on record.
[00:11:24.813 --> 00:11:29.078]  Mosaic Fonseca is the fourth largest asset protection law firm in the world.
[00:11:29.599 --> 00:11:33.203]  Its cybersecurity measures were obviously lacking, but they're not alone.
[00:11:33.604 --> 00:11:36.367]  Studies indicate law firms are easy picking for hackers.
[00:11:36.447 --> 00:11:39.852]  Bloomberg's reported last year that more than 80 percent of U.S.
[00:11:39.892 --> 00:11:41.373]  law firms had already been hacked.
[00:11:41.894 --> 00:11:43.334]  So why are they so vulnerable?
[00:11:43.394 --> 00:11:44.015]  Well, think about it.
[00:11:44.255 --> 00:11:47.295]  All law firms have the following information in their possession.
[00:11:47.696 --> 00:12:09.341]  Case or litigation strategy info, including settlement parameters, argument weak points, confidential client business information, attorney-client privileged communications, and other legally privileged info, client intellectual property, a range of personally identifiable information of all kinds for employees, clients, and third parties.
[00:12:09.381 --> 00:12:10.622]  You've got health information.
[00:12:11.482 --> 00:12:13.863]  I concur with your analysis, but you've gone over much of the data dump.
[00:12:13.903 --> 00:12:15.383]  What is hiding there?
[00:12:40.033 --> 00:12:45.201]  I think the biggest thing that's on there, Alex, is that this is a smear campaign orchestrated by the U.S.
[00:12:45.241 --> 00:12:45.602]  government.
[00:12:46.834 --> 00:12:53.377]  There's an organization called the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that put out this report.
[00:12:54.057 --> 00:13:00.879]  But what they did, I mean, there are 14,000 people who are listed in this report, none of them are Americans.
[00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:06.021]  There's no American politician, there's no American sports figure, there's no American actor, nothing.
[00:13:06.481 --> 00:13:14.544]  And yet, we know for a fact that America probably uses these services of American citizens more than anybody else.
[00:13:15.422 --> 00:13:17.383]  Um, and so I did some checking, Alex.
[00:13:17.443 --> 00:13:25.945]  I found out that the ICIJ is actually, um, it's the, it's part of the, uh, the USA Center for Public Integrity.
[00:13:26.626 --> 00:13:31.407]  It's funded by Soros, Ford Foundation, Carnegie, Rockefeller, W.K.
[00:13:31.427 --> 00:13:31.867]  Kellogg.
[00:13:33.068 --> 00:13:34.008]  The usual suspects.
[00:13:35.038 --> 00:13:43.725]  And it reports to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, OCCRP.
[00:13:44.186 --> 00:13:46.007]  And that's financed by the U.S.
[00:13:46.047 --> 00:13:47.568]  government through USAID.
[00:13:48.289 --> 00:13:50.010]  So this whole thing is a setup.
[00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.893]  It's basically to smear, it does two things, Alex.
[00:13:52.973 --> 00:13:55.335]  It smears our enemies, or the government's enemies.
[00:13:55.835 --> 00:14:01.660]  And number two, it alerts those Americans who are actually in that database that we know who you are.
[00:14:02.706 --> 00:14:10.254]  Um, and it sets up, you know, the table for enormous potential blackmail by the U.S.
[00:14:10.274 --> 00:14:10.595]  government.
[00:14:11.035 --> 00:14:13.297]  This thing is so absurd that it's ridiculous.
[00:14:13.618 --> 00:14:14.979]  There's already been one casualty.
[00:14:15.059 --> 00:14:17.422]  The prime minister of Iceland resigned this morning.
[00:14:18.903 --> 00:14:23.308]  And I think that there's going to be more casualties, but either one of two things is happening.
[00:14:24.249 --> 00:14:27.192]  They will come out later with a list of U.S.
[00:14:27.212 --> 00:14:29.455]  citizens, and they will be selective, as you and I know.
[00:14:30.556 --> 00:14:36.102]  All these people will be blackmailed by one of our Secret Services agencies.
[00:14:39.138 --> 00:14:40.219]  Well, I concur with that.
[00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:44.601]  You know, on Sunday I came out when I first looked at it and I said this is a blackmail operation.
[00:14:44.621 --> 00:14:50.885]  It's been in the news that Germany has the most infiltrated media by the CIA and by the private foundation networks.
[00:14:51.905 --> 00:15:01.051]  They sat on it for a year with a hundred newspapers to vet who they would go after, showing they were very, very selective to clean it, just like WikiLeaks to a certain extent.
[00:15:01.771 --> 00:15:05.872]  Uh, and that clearly it's a way to try to bring in more international law, more regulations.
[00:15:05.952 --> 00:15:13.495]  It is completely selective and just what an amazing scandal that sure enough, you've got the story.
[00:15:13.515 --> 00:15:15.976]  Business Insider, Curt Nemo does the same research.
[00:15:16.276 --> 00:15:18.496]  Leads right back to the Ford and Rockefeller foundations.
[00:15:18.856 --> 00:15:20.397]  They're the ones trying to get rid of the borders.
[00:15:20.757 --> 00:15:22.117]  They're the ones coming after the guns.
[00:15:22.397 --> 00:15:24.758]  They're the ones financing the war on police.
[00:15:24.778 --> 00:15:26.999]  They're the ones financing globalism.
[00:15:27.039 --> 00:15:34.741]  They literally are financing the fall of every nation state, the war against Russia and Ukraine, the overthrow of non-radical Muslim countries.
[00:15:35.201 --> 00:15:36.441]  They are the Legion of Doom.
[00:15:36.481 --> 00:15:43.483]  I mean, Lex Luthor, Alexander Luthor of Fantasyland, has nothing on these true super villains.
[00:15:43.563 --> 00:15:45.524]  I mean, it's so ridiculous.
[00:15:46.645 --> 00:15:53.247]  Well absolutely, like the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the South German newspaper in Munich, sat on this story for over a year.
[00:15:54.327 --> 00:16:00.489]  And we do in fact know that the German media has been in fact highly infiltrated by the CIA.
[00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:12.772]  And I'm sure that every single reporter on the International Commission, what a great title by the way, International Commission of Investigative Journalists, I can guarantee you every single one of those are CIA.
[00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.931]  Yeah.
[00:16:31.312 --> 00:16:43.080]  Yeah, most of this is totally legal, and the ultra-robber baron rich for 60 years act like it's evil if anybody else puts money offshore because you can't trust your government or whatever, or because it's after-tax money.
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.623]  And they're now talking about taking after-tax money out of our accounts.
[00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:47.903]  It's a normal thing.
[00:16:47.963 --> 00:16:54.268]  The elites wrote the book on it, but they don't want the general public or the new wealthy, the nouveau riche, to have access to it.
[00:16:55.302 --> 00:16:55.502]  Right.
[00:16:55.542 --> 00:16:56.882]  Well, I had one myself.
[00:16:57.262 --> 00:16:59.043]  It was after-taxed income.
[00:16:59.543 --> 00:17:02.404]  And I put it offshore because I didn't trust the American banking system.
[00:17:03.804 --> 00:17:06.284]  And, you know, I had full control of it.
[00:17:06.824 --> 00:17:11.225]  And it was independent of whatever happened here in America, which gave me a sense of security.
[00:17:11.686 --> 00:17:14.886]  So there's nothing illegal about any of these things out ashore.
[00:17:15.226 --> 00:17:18.067]  Many of them are used for illegal purposes, no question.
[00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:22.168]  But, by and large, there's nothing wrong with this.
[00:17:22.548 --> 00:17:31.971]  And yet, when it does come out, because, like you said, the Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned, and there's smear campaigns throughout the world, people are going to be terrified.
[00:17:32.851 --> 00:17:39.073]  If the CIA says, look, you know, we know that you're in this database, here's the data, but we want a favor.
[00:17:39.514 --> 00:17:39.974]  Sure.
[00:17:40.514 --> 00:17:40.814]  Exactly.
[00:17:40.834 --> 00:17:43.595]  It's about blackmail, it's about control, and worse than that...
[00:17:44.475 --> 00:17:57.862]  It is about letting the public think our governments are going after corruption, going after international football, you know, soccer organization over little petty stuff about who gets what deal or who gets what sponsorship.
[00:17:58.163 --> 00:18:05.086]  Going after stuff like that while the big multinational banks run the aircraft, run the drugs, run the weapons fast and furious.
[00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:10.529]  It's still going on through Mexico, out of the Marine Corps base in Arizona, to Al-Qaeda, to ISIS.
[00:18:11.789 --> 00:18:20.411]  So of course, this is why we're always saying it's completely insane to have all of your most sensitive information all on the internet, easily accessible by hackers.
[00:18:21.012 --> 00:18:29.214]  And as Kurt Nimmo points out, the Panama Papers do expose offshore tax havens, but what they fail to talk about is the
[00:18:30.314 --> 00:18:35.276]  New arrangement legalized under FATCA, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.
[00:18:35.576 --> 00:18:37.376]  The law makes the parking of dirty U.S.
[00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:39.417]  money abroad practically impossible.
[00:18:39.797 --> 00:18:41.138]  So where does the money go instead?
[00:18:41.578 --> 00:18:42.798]  It stays in the U.S.
[00:18:43.138 --> 00:18:48.480]  And to top it off, there's one specific firm which is spearheading the conversion of the U.S.
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.501]  into Panama, Rothschild.
[00:18:51.661 --> 00:18:52.321]  Well, stick around.
[00:18:52.341 --> 00:18:53.762]  We've got some special reports for you.
[00:18:53.782 --> 00:18:57.823]  And then David Knight and I will be in here breaking down the Wisconsin primaries.
[00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:19.182]  Please take a moment to listen to what I'm about to break down very, very carefully, because the information I'm about to lay out in just two minutes changed my life and changed the life of many, many people around me.
[00:19:19.722 --> 00:19:26.084]  I was a big sports enthusiast, but loved to eat like a pig when I was 10 years old, up to about 22 or so.
[00:19:27.464 --> 00:19:32.870]  And I ran six miles every other day and lifted weights almost every day and had a great physique.
[00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:39.096]  Then I got into radio and television 21 years ago and got so busy in my work I stopped working out.
[00:19:39.116 --> 00:19:47.804]  And everything was okay for four or five years but then suddenly I started putting on pounds every month and in the next 10 years I gained almost 100 pounds.
[00:19:50.807 --> 00:20:01.171]  Then about seven years ago, I began jogging, swimming long distances, and lifting weights again, trying to lose weight, and was only able to lose about 20 of the 98 pounds.
[00:20:01.551 --> 00:20:02.731]  I even changed my diet.
[00:20:02.991 --> 00:20:04.452]  I even increased the exercise.
[00:20:04.472 --> 00:20:04.992]  It didn't work.
[00:20:05.832 --> 00:20:10.874]  But as soon as I began to get the nutrients and compounds that I needed,
[00:20:11.932 --> 00:20:12.873]  My whole life changed.
[00:20:13.494 --> 00:20:19.562]  I've gone from 200 and almost 80 pounds down to about 220 pounds or so.
[00:20:20.163 --> 00:20:21.164]  It is incredible.
[00:20:22.065 --> 00:20:29.434]  And in just the last three years, Super Metal Vitality, developed by Dr. Groob from FullWorksLife.com exclusively, and
[00:20:30.776 --> 00:20:31.577]  We're good to go.

[00:23:07.063 --> 00:23:08.424]  Brought to you with Infowars.com.
[00:23:08.584 --> 00:23:11.927]  Right here, this is actually not a line for the Trump rally.
[00:23:12.047 --> 00:23:14.408]  This is a line for the Bernie rally that's going on tonight.
[00:23:14.829 --> 00:23:16.710]  So Bernie and Trump in the same place.
[00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:20.633]  Will we see supporters of each camp clashing together?
[00:23:20.693 --> 00:23:21.113]  Who knows?
[00:23:21.173 --> 00:23:21.574]  We'll see.
[00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:25.617]  This is a security zone per order of the Milwaukee Police Department.
[00:23:25.897 --> 00:23:26.557]  Sponsored by...
[00:23:27.698 --> 00:23:28.719]  Coors Light!
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:41.390]  They are definitely expecting a large number of protesters here, and with Bernie's rally being located just down the road from Trump's, which is right there in the Milwaukee Theater, you never know, fireworks could break out again.
[00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:43.712]  Hey Alex, God bless you brother.
[00:23:43.752 --> 00:23:44.653]  Thank you for everything.
[00:23:44.953 --> 00:23:46.034]  You're a true patriot.
[00:23:46.495 --> 00:23:49.597]  Thank you to your team, and just keep the fight going.
[00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:49.957]  Thank you.
[00:23:50.558 --> 00:23:55.560]  He's a really unintelligent, narcissistic individual who has absolutely no clue how to run the country.
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.461]  You don't think so?
[00:23:56.701 --> 00:23:57.141]  I really don't.
[00:23:57.161 --> 00:23:57.961]  All right, what about you?
[00:23:58.942 --> 00:24:02.503]  I think he's creepy and I don't like watching him and I don't like everything he says.
[00:24:02.543 --> 00:24:03.464]  It doesn't make any sense.
[00:24:03.744 --> 00:24:04.044]  Okay.
[00:24:04.164 --> 00:24:05.305]  And he lies a lot, so.
[00:24:05.405 --> 00:24:06.605]  Wow, all right.
[00:24:07.306 --> 00:24:08.626]  He's just such a racist.
[00:24:08.686 --> 00:24:15.469]  He's a mean bully and we live in America which is founded on immigration and people coming and giving all their talents.
[00:24:15.489 --> 00:24:19.191]  The things he says about Mexico, the things he says about Muslims, it just is infuriating.
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.720]  Alright, you guys coming to the Trump rally?
[00:24:23.021 --> 00:24:23.761]  Um, yeah.
[00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:24.922]  For a little while.
[00:24:25.222 --> 00:24:26.122]  Yeah?
[00:24:26.502 --> 00:24:28.943]  You know, what's attracted you to Trump?
[00:24:30.564 --> 00:24:33.505]  Um, I don't know.
[00:24:33.785 --> 00:24:34.945]  He's said a few good things.
[00:24:35.025 --> 00:24:35.205]  Yeah?
[00:24:35.466 --> 00:24:36.086]  Just a few.
[00:24:36.566 --> 00:24:37.366]  You live here in Milwaukee?
[00:24:37.466 --> 00:24:37.606]  Yep.
[00:24:38.187 --> 00:24:38.407]  Alright.
[00:24:38.747 --> 00:24:40.227]  What do you think of the city and how it's been doing?
[00:24:40.687 --> 00:24:41.388]  The city pretty good.
[00:24:41.428 --> 00:24:43.389]  I think they need to fix the streets a little bit better.
[00:24:43.409 --> 00:24:47.910]  Hey, I think it's cool to see that you're bringing your kids to a rally, a political rally like this.
[00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:49.771]  You know, teach them what's going on in the world.
[00:24:50.931 --> 00:24:51.891]  Yeah, they need to.
[00:24:52.191 --> 00:25:01.035]  Looks like the city of Milwaukee got a lot of overtime but did not have to do any mass arrests or any type of keeping protesters away from each other.
[00:25:01.075 --> 00:25:03.475]  It was a very civil night tonight, very quiet night.
[00:25:04.256 --> 00:25:05.056]  Hey, did you go to the rally?
[00:25:05.396 --> 00:25:06.316]  You want to talk about it?
[00:25:06.456 --> 00:25:07.057]  It was great.
[00:25:07.197 --> 00:25:08.337]  Alright, what did you think of Trump?
[00:25:09.117 --> 00:25:10.138]  Donald was on tonight.
[00:25:10.178 --> 00:25:13.859]  He's on for Wisconsin and tomorrow's a big day for Donald Trump in the United States.
[00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:14.659]  Do you think he's going to win?
[00:25:15.019 --> 00:25:16.700]  I think he's going to edge him out tomorrow, yes I do.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.661]  He's got a big deficit.
[00:25:19.321 --> 00:25:20.342]  We don't worry about deficits.
[00:25:20.482 --> 00:25:21.662]  He's the underdog.
[00:25:21.702 --> 00:25:28.006]  Nobody in the organized political world agrees with him, except the grassroots people.
[00:25:28.346 --> 00:25:29.106]  He's going to win tomorrow.
[00:25:29.626 --> 00:25:30.827]  I think the rally was pretty cool.
[00:25:31.207 --> 00:25:35.049]  Based on social media, I had no clue what it was actually going to be like.
[00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.170]  There's a whole negative light behind it.
[00:25:37.711 --> 00:25:39.912]  But then, from actually being here, it's not like that at all.
[00:25:40.692 --> 00:25:45.377]  It's time to have a businessman run the country because right now to establish politicians
[00:25:57.688 --> 00:26:00.050]  The last 50 years haven't done anything for us.
[00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:07.775]  $19 trillion in debt and $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities.
[00:26:07.895 --> 00:26:15.941]  And as one senator, I asked one senator one day, I said, so if we hit 4% interest, we're bankrupt, right?
[00:26:16.322 --> 00:26:17.563]  He says, yeah, we're bankrupt.
[00:26:18.263 --> 00:26:21.385]  But he says, oh, Barack Hussein Obama has a following.
[00:26:21.466 --> 00:26:24.308]  And I said, well, that's because we have dumbed down America.
[00:26:24.848 --> 00:26:33.434]  He needs to make some more statements about what he's going to do within the urban communities, with the job loss, the high crime, things of that nature.
[00:26:33.494 --> 00:26:41.741]  But being a business owner, I think he has a good fundamental on what needs to be done as bringing in entrepreneurs for the community.
[00:26:42.101 --> 00:26:43.342]  Are you a business owner yourself?
[00:26:43.642 --> 00:26:44.062]  Yes, I am.
[00:26:44.263 --> 00:26:44.703]  What do you do?
[00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:46.945]  I have an entertainment company where I promote
[00:26:47.725 --> 00:26:49.707]  Live events at venues like this.
[00:26:50.007 --> 00:26:50.228]  Right.
[00:26:50.648 --> 00:26:51.849]  How many people do you think were in the crowd?
[00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.510]  I'll say about 2,000.
[00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:52.510]  2,000?
[00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.532]  Yeah, that's still pretty good.
[00:26:54.752 --> 00:26:55.733]  This venue holds about 4,400.
[00:26:56.674 --> 00:27:01.279]  So you had the whole bottom low row full along with a portion of the upper deck.
[00:27:01.639 --> 00:27:01.860]  All right.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.201]  Let me tell you something right now.
[00:27:03.762 --> 00:27:06.024]  I got interviewed by the Daily Beast right afterwards.
[00:27:06.644 --> 00:27:07.986]  They're spin already, I'll tell you.
[00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:09.708]  Are you with InfoWars, too?
[00:27:10.856 --> 00:27:12.917]  Okay.
[00:27:12.957 --> 00:27:17.960]  What they're asking about, their spin is going to be, just so you know, that there was light crowds.
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.182]  Like, you know, everyone's all trumped out or whatever.
[00:27:21.522 --> 00:27:24.884]  Well, he had just been speaking at Hannity, where people waited all day.
[00:27:25.064 --> 00:27:25.244]  Right.
[00:27:25.464 --> 00:27:26.464]  At Pabst, okay?
[00:27:26.785 --> 00:27:29.086]  He's been speaking all over the state, many venues.
[00:27:29.666 --> 00:27:36.070]  But their play, and they're taking all kinds of pictures of the back of the room, where there are some empty seats in a really big place, too, by the way.
[00:27:36.911 --> 00:27:38.896]  Um, so I think that's going to be the spin tomorrow.
[00:27:39.097 --> 00:27:39.298]  Right.
[00:27:39.438 --> 00:27:43.028]  But no, the polls were wrong the last couple of days.
[00:27:43.189 --> 00:27:43.510]  Okay.
[00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:44.793]  I'm hearing it switched.
[00:27:46.281 --> 00:27:52.607]  I'm hearing he's up 42-32 now, and if that's the case, that's a 20-point swing in two days, which is phenomenal.
[00:27:53.388 --> 00:27:54.209]  Ridiculous, right?
[00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:55.450]  Alex Jones, that's amazing.
[00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:58.893]  And so the beast is going to have to spin this.
[00:27:58.913 --> 00:28:01.355]  I even told the girls, don't you try to spin this, okay?
[00:28:01.916 --> 00:28:03.577]  I'll debate any one of your liberals.
[00:28:04.218 --> 00:28:05.959]  You know, I've seen the truth, I know the truth here.
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:09.783]  Don't you try to launch this story tomorrow that no one's showing up for Trump stuff.
[00:28:10.566 --> 00:28:11.827]  Trump had a great speech tonight.
[00:28:11.847 --> 00:28:13.068]  Melania was here tonight.
[00:28:13.309 --> 00:28:14.150]  Melissa was back.
[00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:14.410]  Ms.
[00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:15.331]  Wisconsin came back.
[00:28:15.491 --> 00:28:16.652]  She brought her on stage tonight.
[00:28:16.672 --> 00:28:17.533]  That was a good speech.
[00:28:18.113 --> 00:28:19.214]  The pastor was great.
[00:28:19.274 --> 00:28:20.356]  And Steve Miller was here.
[00:28:20.416 --> 00:28:23.038]  He talked about Ted Cruz and some of the stuff with him.
[00:28:23.058 --> 00:28:24.139]  Wait, Steve Miller the musician?
[00:28:24.359 --> 00:28:25.681]  No, no.
[00:28:26.021 --> 00:28:28.303]  No, Trump's lead advisory guy, I think.
[00:28:29.464 --> 00:28:30.325]  It was awesome!
[00:28:30.345 --> 00:28:30.485]  Yeah?
[00:28:30.805 --> 00:28:34.768]  Quite honestly, the best thing is just the fact that he wants to protect the security of the country.
[00:28:34.848 --> 00:28:43.014]  I think that's something that, an issue that doesn't get quite enough attention, and I think he's doing a great job of bringing attention to that idea, and people seem to be really welcome to that.
[00:28:43.454 --> 00:28:45.296]  Yes, we're gonna absolutely love Trump.
[00:28:45.336 --> 00:28:49.259]  He was on fire, he was on point, he is a businessman for the United States of America.
[00:28:49.439 --> 00:28:50.319]  So he's not a misogynist?
[00:28:50.519 --> 00:28:52.681]  He is an amazing man, and I love Trump.
[00:28:52.701 --> 00:28:53.702]  Think Trump's got a chance tomorrow?
[00:28:54.423 --> 00:28:55.925]  Absolutely, yes, yes.
[00:28:56.286 --> 00:28:59.110]  How quickly the tables turned in Wisconsin for his favor.
[00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:03.757]  Yeah, I'm a little biased, but I absolutely think the crossovers happened.
[00:29:03.777 --> 00:29:05.780]  I think Trump's gonna take Wisconsin tomorrow, too.
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.403]  I think a lot of people are gonna be surprised.
[00:29:07.623 --> 00:29:08.805]  Supporting the Second Amendment.
[00:29:10.106 --> 00:29:18.153]  Taken care of with veterans, even though they say that they're being taken care of, but I'm a retired vet and I can disagree with that.
[00:29:18.853 --> 00:29:33.945]  And the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the bad part about it is, from my perspective, I believe that the general public doesn't have too much knowledge about what that all entails.
[00:29:34.646 --> 00:29:36.868]  So if they don't get rid of it,
[00:29:38.925 --> 00:29:40.666]  It's bad news for the country.
[00:29:41.227 --> 00:29:46.831]  So, at a lot of these events, there's protesters out there saying Donald's racist, he's xenophobic, he's misogynist.
[00:29:46.871 --> 00:29:48.092]  What do you think of Donald?
[00:29:49.193 --> 00:29:57.079]  Well, I know they usually say that he's a little bit racist, but I look at it just a little bit different than that.
[00:29:57.519 --> 00:29:58.760]  Some of the things that he says,
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:05.023]  It can kind of help the urban communities.
[00:30:05.123 --> 00:30:12.669]  Allowing individuals to come into our country right now when we have our own issues of, even let's take Milwaukee for instance.
[00:30:13.109 --> 00:30:16.592]  Last year we had a homicide rate that increased to 150%.
[00:30:17.033 --> 00:30:19.154]  Chicago also increased.
[00:30:19.174 --> 00:30:22.577]  This has been going on through a lot of urban cities throughout the country.
[00:30:23.157 --> 00:30:25.139]  Massive shootings, job loss.
[00:30:25.159 --> 00:30:27.941]  So we have issues that we need to address here before we allow
[00:30:29.222 --> 00:30:40.833]  First off, illegal immigrants are not a race of people.
[00:30:41.313 --> 00:30:45.937]  They're a group of people who broke the law, they crossed through a border when they weren't allowed to, and they have to go back.
[00:30:46.438 --> 00:30:49.180]  Trump has no problem with legal immigration, and he's made that clear.
[00:30:49.701 --> 00:30:51.822]  So the people who say these things about Trump
[00:30:52.743 --> 00:30:56.065]  Most of the time they have absolutely no idea what his actual policies are.
[00:30:56.425 --> 00:31:01.367]  They hear what the media says and they cry because they have absolutely no idea what he actually stands for.
[00:31:01.387 --> 00:31:04.308]  Well, I don't believe Muslims are considered a race of people either.
[00:31:04.348 --> 00:31:07.250]  I kind of like laugh when people call me a racist for supporting Trump.
[00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.470]  It's like, he's a racist?
[00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:09.331]  How is he a racist?
[00:31:09.371 --> 00:31:12.272]  Tell me one thing he says that's racist and they can't come up with anything.
[00:31:12.292 --> 00:31:14.333]  A lady just walked behind us and said he's a bully.
[00:31:14.373 --> 00:31:14.913]  He's a bully.
[00:31:14.933 --> 00:31:15.554]  What do you think of that?
[00:31:16.474 --> 00:31:18.375]  It's the opposite what's going on.
[00:31:18.715 --> 00:31:23.097]  They're packing together, including some of the GOP, bullying against him.
[00:31:23.177 --> 00:31:24.237]  They're packing together.
[00:31:24.678 --> 00:31:28.139]  Cruz, Kasich, Romney, Ryan, whatever.
[00:31:28.199 --> 00:31:29.480]  It's ridiculous that way.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.441]  Yeah, it's actually the opposite.
[00:31:31.481 --> 00:31:42.865]  He's one guy and it's down to just a few of them for the nominee and he's still, unlike all the naysayers, he's been in the front since the get-go and he's still the frontrunner.
[00:31:42.905 --> 00:31:44.046]  That's got to say something.
[00:31:44.266 --> 00:31:49.188]  I gotta give a shout out to my buddy James, because he's the one that told me about the Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:52.270]  And at work, we'll put him on and listen to him.
[00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:54.851]  The guys and me at work, we love Alex Jones.
[00:31:54.871 --> 00:31:55.691]  Does he get you fired up?
[00:31:56.292 --> 00:31:57.392]  Oh, oh yeah, yeah.
[00:31:57.752 --> 00:31:59.133]  He's great, he's great.
[00:31:59.553 --> 00:32:01.354]  I'm Mr. Jones, I'm a huge fan of your videos.
[00:32:01.834 --> 00:32:04.775]  I actually watched your video about
[00:32:06.076 --> 00:32:16.519]  The science of why American food is being poisoned, is being corrupted by the government, and that video actually inspired me to lose around 70 pounds.
[00:32:16.619 --> 00:32:25.102]  So, on a personal level, I'm supporting what you're doing and I'm really happy that you guys are still keeping strong and doing a good job with the reporting.
[00:32:25.422 --> 00:32:27.483]  I think everybody should have a right to bear arms.
[00:32:28.084 --> 00:32:36.829]  Since Governor Scott Walker allowed for us to have carry concealed weapons, there was an individual that wanted to rob all these grocery stores.
[00:32:36.889 --> 00:32:43.573]  The individual inside the store was legal to carry a firearm, had his firearm on him.
[00:32:43.833 --> 00:32:45.454]  The guy came in with a sawed-off shotgun.
[00:32:45.834 --> 00:32:48.596]  He protected the co-workers and the customers there by shooting the guy.
[00:32:50.157 --> 00:32:51.319]  It was good that he had that on him.
[00:32:51.459 --> 00:32:53.742]  A second one, someone was in a barbershop getting their hair cut.
[00:32:53.762 --> 00:32:55.304]  The guy came in and robbed the barbershop.
[00:32:55.785 --> 00:33:00.231]  The guy had a weapon on him to protect others and himself and shot the guy.
[00:33:00.251 --> 00:33:03.395]  I mean, you know, that's a constitutional right.
[00:33:06.753 --> 00:33:10.174]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:33:10.514 --> 00:33:17.676]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:33:18.256 --> 00:33:26.658]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:33:26.878 --> 00:33:30.959]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:33:31.299 --> 00:33:33.480]  Pathenogens added to the food and water,
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:34.020]  We're good to go.

[00:35:42.338 --> 00:35:42.558]  I'm good.

[00:37:08.277 --> 00:37:25.468]  And in mid-March, before her conviction for money laundering and racketeering in connection with the high-profile escort service she ran catering to Washington's movers and shakers, including Senator David Vitter, Debra was asked by syndicated radio host Alex Jones if she was planning on committing suicide.
[00:37:26.149 --> 00:37:28.090]  No, I'm not planning to commit suicide.
[00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:36.656]  I'm planning to go into court on April 7th and I plan on exposing the government in ways that, you know, I do not think they want me to expose them.
[00:37:37.864 --> 00:37:40.862]  I'm gonna go to Wayne Madsen right now, and then we're gonna play some clips.
[00:37:42.279 --> 00:37:46.962]  Of the lawyer for Palfrey and, of course, myself on Fox News breaking this down at the time it happened.
[00:37:47.383 --> 00:37:50.385]  And then Matt's going to be on this for a full hour on Friday with the lawyer.
[00:37:50.405 --> 00:37:55.348]  But this is just a sneak peek and an update on what's happened and the latest developments.
[00:37:55.508 --> 00:37:59.191]  First off, great job, Wayne, doggedly being in there.
[00:37:59.991 --> 00:38:06.336]  Please tell us who the progenitors of the Cruz sex scandal are, how much validity there is to the hookers.
[00:38:07.797 --> 00:38:10.099]  Obviously, Radar says it is the number.
[00:38:11.159 --> 00:38:12.059]  You didn't want to go that far.
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.320]  You just said, well, he's got some big problems.
[00:38:14.821 --> 00:38:16.081]  How serious is this?
[00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:18.842]  And where do you see this going, Wayne?
[00:38:19.942 --> 00:38:23.544]  Well, Alex, I think we're dealing with two different stories here.
[00:38:23.924 --> 00:38:33.288]  The Enquirer, a couple of weeks ago, had one story about five women that Ted Cruz supposedly had extramarital affairs with.
[00:38:34.148 --> 00:38:36.449]  Of course, that's after his marriage to Heidi in 2001.
[00:38:37.029 --> 00:38:38.029]  One of those women
[00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:43.813]  Uh, was said to be a prostitute, but they did not give that individual's name.
[00:38:44.513 --> 00:38:50.116]  This story, I believe, has to do with, uh, Ted Cruz before he got married.
[00:38:50.157 --> 00:38:56.921]  And if you, if you noted, uh, last night when he appeared with Megyn Kelly in a town hall,
[00:38:57.481 --> 00:38:57.521]  In
[00:39:15.951 --> 00:39:23.018]  Man, after he left Harvard, he came to Washington.
[00:39:23.979 --> 00:39:28.443]  He clerked for Chief Justice Rehnquist.
[00:39:28.984 --> 00:39:34.749]  Then he went to work for a law firm representing the National Rifle Association.
[00:39:34.809 --> 00:39:36.972]  He also worked on the Clinton impeachment.
[00:39:38.272 --> 00:39:50.135]  He also represented John Boehner in an issue having to do with Jim McDermott and a phone call that was supposedly intercepted and given to McDermott.
[00:39:50.375 --> 00:39:54.836]  But that put him on the radar screen for a lot of GOP individuals.
[00:39:54.936 --> 00:40:06.459]  So, in 1999, he goes to Austin and he joins the Bush-Cheney presidential campaign.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:13.170]  And he represented Bush in Florida and the whole thing in 2000 with the election.
[00:40:16.355 --> 00:40:31.360]  He wanted to get a job in the White House, but apparently, from what I've been told, he was not very well thought of by a lot of people on the transition team that were handing out the federal jobs.
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:36.322]  So all he managed to get was a job at the Federal Trade Commission.
[00:40:37.102 --> 00:40:42.204]  Probably an organization, knowing Ted Cruz's policies, he'd like to do away with.
[00:40:43.184 --> 00:40:49.526]  He also had a job as an assistant to Attorney General Ashcroft at Justice.
[00:40:50.766 --> 00:41:07.391]  It's during this time frame before he was selected as Solicitor General for Texas by Governor Abbott, now Governor Abbott, then Attorney General Abbott, that I believe we have the smoking phone calls.
[00:41:08.511 --> 00:41:21.523]  Um, and, uh, when I investigated the Palfrey story, and I was, she told me I was the first one who got all of her phone records because she had given a partial list to Brian Ross at ABC News.
[00:41:21.983 --> 00:41:28.169]  She felt very bad about what ABC did to her because, uh, here they had some of the lists
[00:41:28.729 --> 00:41:39.537]  And then they come out in a report and said, well, we went through what we were given and we didn't find any names of any notoriety, which was a complete hogwash.
[00:41:40.017 --> 00:41:42.679]  ABC took a dive on that.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:55.009]  And so at this at this point in time, I'm looking through the phone lists in a very I got to say it was I didn't have.
[00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:58.692]  The means to do intellious searches and whatnot.
[00:41:59.133 --> 00:42:01.515]  So I went to the public libraries in the D.C.
[00:42:01.635 --> 00:42:15.386]  area and was going and looking up all these phone numbers on some called the Hanes crisscross directories, which were used by direct marketers to, you know, basically they had a phone number, then they'd try to match it to an address.
[00:42:15.526 --> 00:42:23.853]  Sure, I should have introduced you as Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist who first got the full list and risked his life to go connect these numbers to public figures.
[00:42:23.893 --> 00:42:26.616]  I mean, this is dangerous stuff you've been doing, my friend.
[00:42:27.335 --> 00:42:46.282]  Well, other than the fact that I thought I still believe I nailed a one-time attorney for televangelist Pat Robertson, the other find was the central switch for the Bush-Cheney transition team, which was located at the West Building in McLean, Virginia.
[00:42:46.442 --> 00:42:51.484]  And that's very close to where Cheney lived at the time and also CIA headquarters.
[00:42:52.004 --> 00:42:53.505]  Later, it became very apparent
[00:42:54.105 --> 00:43:08.750]  When Jean Palfrey tried to invoke the Classified Information Procedures Act at her trial, and the new judge on the case refused to allow that, that she had some relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:22.795]  And I wrote and I believe still that that was with the executive director of the CIA, former head of the logistics for the agency at their Frankfurt station in Germany,
[00:43:23.055 --> 00:43:30.924]  Yeah, it's an ick factor with Ted Cruz, I think, and that's the reason he sort of got shunned by the Bush White House.
[00:43:30.964 --> 00:43:35.809]  And he said, well, we got to give him a job out of the plum book, but, you know, make sure it's not here.
[00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:41.956]  So it turned out it was over at the FTC and some low level job, political job at the Justice
[00:43:42.096 --> 00:43:44.477]  Sure, I want to bring up the lawyer who I know you know.
[00:43:44.497 --> 00:43:47.819]  I know you've been out with Palfrey and him and others at Memory Serves.
[00:43:48.299 --> 00:43:51.840]  This Montgomery Blair Sibley has a gag order on him.
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.962]  I want you to flesh that out for us because the numbers are out but not the names.
[00:43:55.222 --> 00:43:56.002]  Let's play a clip.
[00:43:56.042 --> 00:43:57.003]  He's coming on the show Friday.
[00:43:58.004 --> 00:44:09.173]  My name is Montgomery Blair Sibley, and I was the attorney for Deborah Jean Palfrey, known as the DC Madam, who for 13 years ran a high-end escort service in the District of Columbia.
[00:44:09.793 --> 00:44:13.376]  I am the custodian of the records of that escort service.
[00:44:13.877 --> 00:44:20.282]  And since 2007, I have been under a court order restraining me from publicly releasing those records.
[00:44:21.082 --> 00:44:25.827]  Those records contain information relevant to the 2016 presidential election.
[00:44:26.408 --> 00:44:31.613]  And as such, last month I went into court seeking permission to release those records.
[00:44:32.274 --> 00:44:38.961]  Rather than hearing me, the court instead refused to even file my pleadings, essentially shutting the courthouse door to me.
[00:44:40.062 --> 00:44:42.544]  I must continue this fight to the D.C.
[00:44:42.584 --> 00:44:45.226]  Circuit Court of Appeal and then on to the U.S.
[00:44:45.366 --> 00:44:46.166]  Supreme Court.
[00:44:46.647 --> 00:44:56.073]  To do that, I will need to spend $25,000 in filing fees, printing fees, and attorney's fees for representation in those courts.
[00:44:56.914 --> 00:44:59.335]  I need your help to get on that horse.
[00:44:59.695 --> 00:44:59.916]  Alright.
[00:45:00.116 --> 00:45:00.536]  Thank you.
[00:45:00.816 --> 00:45:02.057]  He's going to join us Friday.
[00:45:02.077 --> 00:45:04.779]  I mean, Wayne, you're a smart guy when it comes to law.
[00:45:05.099 --> 00:45:08.701]  Would it be legal for Trump to pay to get these numbers released?
[00:45:09.962 --> 00:45:13.403]  Or the names, because the word is, it's matched up with Ted Cruz.
[00:45:13.483 --> 00:45:14.643]  Isn't that a huge torpedo?
[00:45:14.963 --> 00:45:17.804]  Can Trump pay for that instead of us coming and asking the audience to do it?
[00:45:18.925 --> 00:45:26.527]  I would suggest that Donald Trump not get involved in this, but he's got to have a lot of deep-pocketed supporters who could come up with that.
[00:45:27.287 --> 00:45:29.828]  When we're talking D.C., that's not a huge amount of money, $25K.
[00:45:31.915 --> 00:45:42.190]  Um, what I know about this case with the records is Gene Palfrey originally had Judge Gladys Kessler as the trial judge, U.S.
[00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:46.716]  District Judge in the District of Columbia, U.S.
[00:45:46.776 --> 00:45:47.036]  Court.
[00:45:47.717 --> 00:46:01.914]  I attended many of those hearings and Judge Kessler was very, very sympathetic to Jean Palfrey and seemed more interested in finding out the identities of the customers of her escort service.
[00:46:02.254 --> 00:46:06.680]  A couple times she said, you know, I really think that we ought to be also looking at
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:08.441]  Who the clients were.
[00:46:08.982 --> 00:46:10.263]  And the U.S.
[00:46:10.323 --> 00:46:14.326]  attorneys there at the time really were irritated at that.
[00:46:14.386 --> 00:46:16.508]  That's not where they wanted this thing to go.
[00:46:16.948 --> 00:46:25.155]  All of a sudden, Judge Kessler goes to the senior judge at the U.S.
[00:46:25.195 --> 00:46:27.496]  District Court and asks to be relieved from the case.
[00:46:28.477 --> 00:46:30.918]  I heard through the grapevine that she had been threatened.
[00:46:30.998 --> 00:46:37.761]  The woman was single, she lived alone, and it would have been quite easy for her to be harmed some way.
[00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:42.284]  Because look what happened to Jean Poffrey and one of her escorts later.
[00:46:42.324 --> 00:46:43.324]  They were both found hanging.
[00:46:43.344 --> 00:46:44.765]  Sure, the professor got whacked.
[00:46:45.765 --> 00:46:51.348]  And that's what's so scary about this is, they want to indict her years later to cover up that the government was using her.
[00:46:52.472 --> 00:46:57.381]  Like you send the women to prison, but the guys who ran it all don't get in trouble?
[00:46:57.681 --> 00:46:58.843]  Just leave these women alone!
[00:47:05.675 --> 00:47:06.695]  BrainForce is here.
[00:47:07.215 --> 00:47:09.496]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.776 --> 00:47:17.658]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:47:18.418 --> 00:47:22.019]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:22.039 --> 00:47:24.379]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:24.739 --> 00:47:28.280]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.441]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:31.961 --> 00:47:36.766]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:37.286 --> 00:47:39.168]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:39.508 --> 00:47:43.952]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:44.112 --> 00:47:46.134]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:46.775 --> 00:47:48.216]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:48.376 --> 00:47:48.636]  Exactly.
[00:47:48.656 --> 00:47:52.437]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:52.957 --> 00:48:00.980]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:05.888 --> 00:48:10.889]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:11.129 --> 00:48:17.250]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:24.412]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:24.752 --> 00:48:34.654]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[00:48:35.254 --> 00:48:41.195]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:41.415 --> 00:48:44.116]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:44.496 --> 00:48:45.976]  And adenosylcobalamin.
[00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:49.577]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:48:49.857 --> 00:48:51.457]  No needles, no injections.
[00:48:51.737 --> 00:48:53.238]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:48:53.378 --> 00:48:54.438]  Try it for yourself.
[00:48:54.578 --> 00:48:56.158]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.
[00:48:56.878 --> 00:49:02.039]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:19.047]  They've created ISIS.
[00:49:19.388 --> 00:49:22.019]  Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama.
[00:49:23.513 --> 00:49:26.595]  He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter.
[00:49:27.055 --> 00:49:36.720]  They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:51.908]  Hillary Clinton would have us all forget about the failed regime changes she oversaw in Egypt and Libya that led up to the staged rollout of Benghazi, as an actual Marine sergeant pointed out to Bill Clinton on the campaign trail back in February.
[00:49:52.148 --> 00:49:55.909]  Eight years active duty service, two tours direct.
[00:49:55.929 --> 00:49:59.170]  Between the 31, I had seven that were killed, six wouldn't be on their terms.
[00:49:59.851 --> 00:50:03.052]  And I have met with many of these Gold Star parents and families, so I've seen them.
[00:50:05.093 --> 00:50:06.773]  I've seen them mourn.
[00:50:06.933 --> 00:50:11.955]  And the thing is that we had four lives in Benghazi that were killed and your wife tried to cover it up.
[00:50:13.436 --> 00:50:24.003]  Benghazi, now commonly known as a bungled covert operation, nothing less than a CIA arms transfer of Qaddafi's pilfered arsenal to ISIS.
[00:50:24.203 --> 00:50:31.188]  Hillary's accusations of Trump now being somehow responsible for ISIS are on their face laughable.
[00:50:31.748 --> 00:50:40.975]  The way Donald Trump talks about terrorism and his, you know, very insulting language toward Muslims is making him the recruiting sergeant.
[00:50:42.096 --> 00:50:47.904]  In January of this year, Soros dropped $8 million to boost Hillary's sluggish campaign.
[00:50:48.144 --> 00:50:57.596]  While we are all overwhelmed and diverted by the ISIS chaos, the New World Order bankers extend their tentacles into their customers' bank accounts worldwide.
[00:50:57.896 --> 00:51:13.079]  As Zero Hedge reports, Wikileaks has now verified what former head of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, admitted one month ago when he said that Europe's economic depression is the result of deliberate policy choices made by EU elites.
[00:51:13.419 --> 00:51:20.761]  It is also what AIG bank strategist Bernard Connolly said back in 2008 when laying out what Europe wants.
[00:51:21.001 --> 00:51:41.952]  The evidence is staggering, as Wikileaks published the transcript of a teleconference that took place on March 19, 2016, between the top two IMF officials in charge of managing the Greek debt crisis, Paul Thompson, the head of IMF's European Department, and Delia Velkulescu, the IMF mission chief for Greece.
[00:51:42.512 --> 00:52:04.223]  The IMF officials say that a threat of an imminent financial catastrophe, as The Guardian puts it, is needed to force other players into accepting its measures, such as cutting Greek pensions and working conditions, or as Bloomberg puts it, considering a plan to cause a credit event in Greece and destabilize Europe.
[00:52:04.503 --> 00:52:17.316]  Under the banner of the globalist soft war through the terror of ISIS, Europe is gradually being forced into total submission, while many Americans bitterly cling to their blind ignorance in the face of an upcoming storm.
[00:52:17.957 --> 00:52:19.278]  Oh, I see nothing!
[00:52:19.559 --> 00:52:20.620]  I was not here!
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.483]  I did not even get up this morning!
[00:52:25.486 --> 00:52:29.030]  With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans.
[00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:34.297]  Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans?
[00:52:34.857 --> 00:52:37.401]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:52:37.741 --> 00:52:44.149]  It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.
[00:52:44.369 --> 00:52:54.023]  As ISIS Brigadier General Hillary Clinton lectures the home of the brave and the land of the free, the average American citizen is genuinely insulted.
[00:52:54.324 --> 00:52:56.006]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:53:04.892 --> 00:53:08.493]  This is Joe Biggs with Infowars.com at the Villanova campus.
[00:53:08.773 --> 00:53:14.195]  Now as you can see, I put some pictures up on social media, there was maybe 10 police vehicles.
[00:53:14.255 --> 00:53:19.257]  Now there's emergency response teams, tons of police vehicles lined up all the way through here.
[00:53:19.577 --> 00:53:25.579]  If you can see all this, people from Philadelphia, I mean, yeah, from Philly, the Radnor Police, which is the local police.
[00:53:25.639 --> 00:53:26.960]  You got some people from Delaware.
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:30.021]  I mean, they are expecting a full-out
[00:53:31.162 --> 00:53:33.003]  Riot tonight with what they've got out here.
[00:53:34.104 --> 00:53:36.707]  Ambulances, firefighters, riot police.
[00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:39.069]  I mean this is crazy.
[00:53:39.469 --> 00:53:43.993]  Imagine what it's going to be like though this summer in Cleveland at the RNC.
[00:53:44.013 --> 00:53:48.477]  They've already got people inciting violence if Trump wins.
[00:53:48.918 --> 00:53:53.141]  You've got Trump supporters saying that they're going to go to the streets if the election's stolen from them.
[00:53:54.221 --> 00:54:02.004]  This is a small taste of what Cleveland's going to look like this summer and possibly in Philadelphia as well for the DNC.
[00:54:02.704 --> 00:54:10.468]  Now if only people would actually riot for something important instead of a bunch of young, rich college kids who got a Ferrari dealership down the road.
[00:54:10.488 --> 00:54:11.428]  Sorry, I got to keep pointing that out.
[00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:12.508]  That's blowing my mind.
[00:54:13.229 --> 00:54:18.671]  But they're going to come out here and riot for a basketball game, win or lose, and these guys prepared.
[00:54:18.691 --> 00:54:19.451]  It should be interesting.
[00:54:19.511 --> 00:54:21.952]  Stay tuned for more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:23.653]  I'll be covering this event all night.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:55.122]  Think about this!
[00:55:55.142 --> 00:55:55.262]  Yo!
[00:55:55.322 --> 00:55:56.285]  What are you gonna do?
[00:55:56.385 --> 00:55:58.711]  It's Philly, let them have fucking fun, they're gonna go nuts tonight!
[00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:34.159]  My man Biggs comes to Philly for the weekend and Villanova wins the championship.
[00:56:34.179 --> 00:56:35.321]  What do you got?
[00:57:02.031 --> 00:57:09.793]  Now we're at the University of Villanova campus where tonight Villanova will be playing in the national championship against UNC.
[00:57:10.274 --> 00:57:16.756]  Now there's tons of riot police and as you can see all these bars are completely and totally packed full of fans.
[00:57:16.856 --> 00:57:20.577]  People willing to get out on the streets later tonight, win or lose, and riot.
[00:57:20.937 --> 00:57:29.100]  Now the interesting thing is though is we have a upcoming presidential election that no one quite frankly, especially on college campuses, really cares that much about.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.460]  Will people riot
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.882]  If their candidate is not selected.
[00:57:33.162 --> 00:57:40.048]  But I guarantee you, drunk college kids will be more upset over a loss or win regardless.
[00:57:40.068 --> 00:57:41.589]  They're going to come out here and do something.
[00:57:41.869 --> 00:57:45.532]  Villanova is known to have very rich college students.
[00:57:45.592 --> 00:57:49.075]  I mean for crying out loud, there's a Ferrari dealership right up the road.
[00:57:49.436 --> 00:57:50.396]  So what's going to happen?
[00:57:50.617 --> 00:57:53.119]  Are we going to have people upset at the RNC this year?
[00:57:53.139 --> 00:57:56.422]  Are we going to have people upset at the DNC if Bernie Sanders doesn't make it?
[00:57:56.782 --> 00:57:58.023]  Or if Donald Trump doesn't get it?
[00:57:58.243 --> 00:58:00.705]  Or if Donald Trump wins, where people go out on the streets and riot.
[00:58:00.925 --> 00:58:07.471]  But I can tell you this, tonight will be interesting here at the University of Villanova campus, right outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
[00:58:07.491 --> 00:58:09.953]  You like Donald Trump?
[00:58:10.033 --> 00:58:10.874]  Oh, f**k yeah!
[00:58:11.274 --> 00:58:13.556]  Trump 2016, my boy!
[00:58:59.627 --> 00:59:00.587]  Stay tuned for more reports.
[00:59:00.647 --> 00:59:02.428]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:07.091]  Knockout is back.
[00:59:07.431 --> 00:59:18.536]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep, restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:18.916 --> 00:59:20.637]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:21.117 --> 00:59:21.838]  L-theanine,
[00:59:22.498 --> 00:59:30.239]  Hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:30.639 --> 00:59:32.400]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:37.361]  It's the same price as leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece.
[00:59:37.821 --> 00:59:43.462]  It has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult, and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
[00:59:43.802 --> 00:59:45.042]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:45.202 --> 00:59:47.162]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:50.765 --> 00:59:54.711]  You are watching the InfoWars Nightly News, which airs 7 p.m.
[00:59:54.751 --> 00:59:57.215]  Central at InfoWarsNews.com.
[00:59:57.335 --> 01:00:00.059]  And your support is helping us defend liberty worldwide.
[01:00:26.377 --> 01:00:28.738]  And welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:00:28.778 --> 01:00:35.662]  We'll be with you live for the next 30 minutes to an hour while we wait for these results to come in from the Wisconsin primary.
[01:00:36.062 --> 01:00:37.903]  Joining me, of course, is David Knight.
[01:00:38.343 --> 01:00:42.666]  Now tonight, we've got two candidates vying to take down their party's leaders.
[01:00:42.706 --> 01:00:46.308]  Of course, that's going to give Cruz or Bernie Sanders a big boost.
[01:00:47.228 --> 01:00:49.090]  Um, you know, let's look at the Democratic side.
[01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:52.312]  You know, Hillary has really been trying to shake Sanders.
[01:00:52.392 --> 01:00:57.195]  She thought this was going to be a super easy win, and he has a persistent presence.
[01:00:57.275 --> 01:01:03.160]  He's expecting record turnout tonight, and of course that's going to give him a huge boost if he does happen to win.
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:12.106]  It's going to be an interesting situation if there's a rough parity with delegates, especially if he's ahead of her and the superdelegates take that away from him.
[01:01:12.146 --> 01:01:16.750]  So it's going to be an interesting two conventions as we come up to this deadline here.
[01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:31.181]  There was an interesting article, you know, we're talking about Bernie Sanders that WND had going back to a 1981 situation where he went to the New York Times and they reported that he went to a charity event, it was a United Way charity event, and he made the statement
[01:01:31.801 --> 01:01:37.027]  I don't believe in charities.
[01:01:37.728 --> 01:01:41.172]  He says I don't believe in charities.
[01:01:41.212 --> 01:01:42.494]  There was a shocked silence.
[01:01:42.534 --> 01:01:50.443]  They reported and he said there's fundamental concepts on which charities are based and contended government rather than charity organizations should take over responsibility for social programs.
[01:01:51.389 --> 01:01:55.233]  And that is the problem that I have with Bernie Sanders.
[01:01:55.534 --> 01:01:56.915]  It's his socialism.
[01:01:56.935 --> 01:01:59.998]  You know, he can be right on some issues.
[01:02:00.038 --> 01:02:02.901]  He's taken some civil liberties issues that I agree with him on.
[01:02:03.282 --> 01:02:06.705]  He's taken a good stand on the trans-pacific...
[01:02:07.626 --> 01:02:08.146]  I think so.
[01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:25.615]  I don't
[01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:43.011]  I don't know.
[01:02:57.776 --> 01:03:03.500]  I was trying to push through ClintonCare, HillaryCare, right after Bill Clinton was elected.
[01:03:04.141 --> 01:03:08.824]  I went to a local meeting where the congressman was pushing HillaryCare.
[01:03:09.364 --> 01:03:14.588]  And I stood up and I said, we need to try to enable charities.
[01:03:14.728 --> 01:03:19.031]  I'm all for charity, but I'm not for mandates or coercion.
[01:03:19.071 --> 01:03:21.353]  And when I said the word charity, before I could get to the rest of it,
[01:03:21.813 --> 01:03:22.093]  I don't
[01:03:37.262 --> 01:03:41.127]  Democrats, whether it's Hillary or whether it's Bernie, they are socialists.
[01:03:41.367 --> 01:03:43.930]  And they hate voluntary association.
[01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:47.314]  And that's what charities are really about.
[01:03:47.354 --> 01:03:52.360]  They want to give you the opportunity to vote on how much the government can control you.
[01:03:52.941 --> 01:03:56.145]  That's the democratic part of the democratic socialism.
[01:03:56.525 --> 01:04:01.266]  But when we look at the horse race today, everybody is saying, well, this is a chance for the momentum to change.
[01:04:01.667 --> 01:04:05.128]  We need to understand how we're being manipulated in this whole process.
[01:04:05.628 --> 01:04:12.990]  Because you've got the GOP establishment here in Wisconsin, and what they have set up here is a situation where there are no primaries for two weeks.
[01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:15.171]  Now we got Wisconsin, one state.
[01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:17.152]  There's not going to be anything else for another two weeks.
[01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:17.492]  Right.
[01:04:17.572 --> 01:04:18.493]  So here they are in the middle.
[01:04:19.013 --> 01:04:22.975]  It gives them two weeks to prepare and put everything they can into Wisconsin.
[01:04:22.995 --> 01:04:28.898]  Understand these local talk radio show hosts that are in Wisconsin really are the power base of people like
[01:04:29.318 --> 01:04:32.201]  Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus and Scott Walker.
[01:04:32.341 --> 01:04:35.584]  They are exhibit A with what's wrong with the GOP.
[01:04:35.945 --> 01:04:39.108]  These are the arrogant globalists that are in your face.
[01:04:39.148 --> 01:04:49.419]  And if you go back and you look at Paul Ryan's history, this man has been about open borders, about replacing the population here in America, overtly talking about this his entire career.
[01:04:49.499 --> 01:04:50.259]  That's what he's about.
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:51.901]  So this is
[01:04:52.862 --> 01:04:56.985]  Totally antagonistic to what the voters really want in the GOP base.
[01:04:57.045 --> 01:04:58.766]  But we're seeing this here with the establishment.
[01:04:58.786 --> 01:05:15.278]  So if Ted Cruz can't win with the help of all the GOP establishment and the inner core, which comes from Wisconsin, and all these talk show hosts that are there, and all of the outside money and super PACs that have poured millions of dollars into this race, if he can't win and win big there, don't tell me he's got any momentum.
[01:05:15.318 --> 01:05:15.718]  He doesn't.
[01:05:15.758 --> 01:05:18.440]  And if he loses this, it is a major defeat for him.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.721]  It's like losing his home state.
[01:05:19.901 --> 01:05:22.183]  Right, yeah, this is a must win for Cruz.
[01:05:22.323 --> 01:05:26.185]  And this was something that Richard Reeves said earlier on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:05:26.205 --> 01:05:27.846]  We've been seeing it on all of the networks.
[01:05:27.866 --> 01:05:29.047]  They're all talking about it.
[01:05:29.287 --> 01:05:30.088]  Even Karl Rove said it.
[01:05:30.208 --> 01:05:33.750]  These radio talk show hosts and how everyone's in for Cruz.
[01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:40.395]  And then if Donald Trump dared to speak out against Scott Walker, so their people are not in favor of him.
[01:05:40.895 --> 01:05:42.457]  That really turned a lot of people off.
[01:05:42.857 --> 01:05:50.743]  And then interestingly, when they were looking at some of the exit polls, it seems like Ted Cruz is actually getting a lot of the evangelicals.
[01:05:51.564 --> 01:05:57.929]  I think more than 53% of evangelicals going for Cruz, which is kind of interesting difference there.
[01:05:57.949 --> 01:06:01.932]  That'll be different because he hasn't carried the evangelicals throughout the South.
[01:06:02.073 --> 01:06:02.253]  Right.
[01:06:02.933 --> 01:06:04.955]  He did in Iowa, I believe.
[01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:07.057]  That was a key part of his victory there.
[01:06:07.657 --> 01:06:11.219]  They keep talking about him as being the candidate of the South and so forth.
[01:06:11.239 --> 01:06:24.865]  And when you talk about the evangelicals, when you talk about Ted Cruz's base, essentially, we have to remember that what's coming up after we're going to be talked to for two weeks about his, this massive sea change of momentum, that's what the establishment's going to be pushing.
[01:06:25.505 --> 01:06:33.091]  In two weeks, he's got New York, he's got Pennsylvania, he's got Connecticut, Delaware, a lot of northeastern states where he's not going to do well.
[01:06:33.512 --> 01:06:38.676]  And as Roger Stone has said, you can basically count him out after April 26th.
[01:06:38.936 --> 01:06:45.242]  He's not going to have a mathematical chance of doing anything other than turning it into a brokered convention.
[01:06:45.522 --> 01:06:48.965]  And the GOP establishment has already said that in a brokered convention,
[01:06:49.545 --> 01:06:51.226]  They don't want Ted Cruz either.
[01:06:51.246 --> 01:06:54.188]  They don't want Ted Cruz any more than Donald Trump.
[01:06:54.208 --> 01:07:01.712]  So he's, you know, he's not doing anything really to help himself or his voters aren't doing anything to help him either because they're going to throw him out as well.
[01:07:01.732 --> 01:07:02.352]  That's their intention.
[01:07:02.372 --> 01:07:04.433]  Guys, he is the Goldman ringer.
[01:07:04.673 --> 01:07:05.474]  That's what he is.
[01:07:06.094 --> 01:07:11.397]  And let me tell you, after spending a week and a day in Wisconsin, I can't tell you
[01:07:12.472 --> 01:07:15.755]  I found one person in Madison, Wisconsin, actually.
[01:07:16.255 --> 01:07:16.976]  Very liberal town.
[01:07:17.056 --> 01:07:18.036]  That was for Ted Cruz.
[01:07:18.197 --> 01:07:21.339]  The only person that came up to me and said, I'm for Ted Cruz.
[01:07:21.379 --> 01:07:23.541]  I actually already early voted for him.
[01:07:24.161 --> 01:07:24.401]  Wow.
[01:07:24.862 --> 01:07:25.502]  Only person.
[01:07:25.883 --> 01:07:29.305]  Everyone else was either... Did you ask them if they wanted to take their vote back, Rob?
[01:07:31.387 --> 01:07:32.768]  He was a drunk college student, too.
[01:07:34.129 --> 01:07:35.030]  May have had something to do with it.
[01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:36.271]  Drunk and voting, yeah.
[01:07:37.145 --> 01:07:43.206]  But it was either Bernie, and most of the Bernie, I would say 60% of the Bernie supporters couldn't even vote.
[01:07:43.366 --> 01:07:47.767]  They were high school kids, or younger, and they couldn't even vote.
[01:07:48.647 --> 01:07:53.709]  And then you have this large contingent, huge contingent of Trump fans.
[01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:55.689]  Everywhere we went, Trump fans.
[01:07:55.709 --> 01:08:04.391]  And I got one example here from, this is from Wausau, which they both went, Ted Cruz went there on the 28th, and then Donald went there on the 2nd.
[01:08:05.919 --> 01:08:11.308]  Ted Cruz had 400 people in his audience at the Central Wisconsin Convention and Expo Center.
[01:08:12.169 --> 01:08:13.852]  Donald Trump went to the same place.
[01:08:15.114 --> 01:08:17.598]  This Washington AP is reporting he had 1,600 inside.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:32.712]  Okay, I talked to somebody there, they said they let in 1,700, and then there was another 1,000 to 1,200 outside listening to what was going on, because they set up loudspeakers at some of these larger events so people can hear.
[01:08:33.413 --> 01:08:36.196]  So, what's that, five, six times?
[01:08:37.217 --> 01:08:37.297]  Yeah.
[01:08:39.113 --> 01:08:41.975]  I don't see how it could be even close at this point.
[01:08:42.395 --> 01:08:43.295]  It boggles the mind.
[01:08:44.096 --> 01:08:45.076]  We're in Appleton.
[01:08:45.196 --> 01:08:45.837]  That's 2900 to 400.
[01:08:45.877 --> 01:08:47.438]  Three blocks down the street.
[01:08:47.458 --> 01:08:47.978]  Right.
[01:08:48.278 --> 01:08:49.299]  Three blocks down the street.
[01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:51.540]  I mean, how is anyone competing with that?
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:51.880]  Right.
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:54.741]  I mean, how are we even having this discussion at this point?
[01:08:55.022 --> 01:08:55.582]  I'm surprised.
[01:08:55.842 --> 01:08:58.264]  Well, I'll tell you why you're having that discussion at this point, Rob.
[01:08:59.025 --> 01:09:03.088]  It's because of the mainstream media, like Politico, for example.
[01:09:03.148 --> 01:09:04.870]  I talked about this on the fourth hour today.
[01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:11.776]  Politico's story was Donald Trump and the loss of momentum, the loss of enthusiasm.
[01:09:12.216 --> 01:09:15.840]  He played to an unenthusiastic crowd that only filled half of the auditorium.
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:21.124]  Now, whether that's true or not, they don't say how big that auditorium is or how big the crowd was.
[01:09:21.164 --> 01:09:22.866]  And then they say, but on the other side of town,
[01:09:23.346 --> 01:09:31.113]  Ted Cruz had a rally where they had all these, filing in all these politicians from Wisconsin as well as talk show hosts from Wisconsin.
[01:09:31.454 --> 01:09:32.534]  A very enthusiastic crowd.
[01:09:32.595 --> 01:09:35.377]  And it's like, well, okay, how do you measure the enthusiasm?
[01:09:35.417 --> 01:09:39.621]  But you could measure the crowd, but they deliberately don't talk about numbers.
[01:09:39.641 --> 01:09:41.363]  And you just talked about what happened in Wausau.
[01:09:42.003 --> 01:09:50.008]  The same facility and on different nights, Donald Trump got more than seven times the number of people that Ted Cruz did.
[01:09:50.028 --> 01:09:52.369]  But that's the narrative that they're trying to promote.
[01:09:52.689 --> 01:10:01.455]  And they can very carefully craft around, you know, when you swear to testify in a court, you say, I'll tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
[01:10:01.475 --> 01:10:03.356]  Well, they don't tell the whole truth.
[01:10:03.996 --> 01:10:06.657]  They say, well, you know, he had his auditorium half filled.
[01:10:06.677 --> 01:10:09.418]  Well, was it a 15,000 stadium auditorium?
[01:10:09.638 --> 01:10:10.338]  We don't know.
[01:10:10.479 --> 01:10:13.420]  You know, it was a we don't know if it was a small venue.
[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:19.402]  We do know that it's been reported this week that Heidi Cruz and Carly Fiorina did a joint
[01:10:20.456 --> 01:10:20.836]  Speech.
[01:10:21.136 --> 01:10:23.457]  And they had an audience of 50.
[01:10:23.497 --> 01:10:25.738]  50 people show up to hear this.
[01:10:25.899 --> 01:10:27.019]  I went to see Bill Clinton.
[01:10:27.319 --> 01:10:28.500]  He didn't even fill the room.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:29.260]  Yeah.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.180]  There may have been.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:30.601]  Yeah.
[01:10:30.921 --> 01:10:34.943]  If I say 600, I'm giving him a lot of credit because it probably wasn't that many.
[01:10:35.323 --> 01:10:38.184]  Now, we have a shot here from a video that we put up.
[01:10:38.224 --> 01:10:41.746]  Mainstream local media showcases single Trump protester.
[01:10:42.146 --> 01:10:42.966]  Back it up a little bit.
[01:10:44.587 --> 01:10:48.969]  And you can see this is inside an hour after the event has started.
[01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:51.111]  Okay, people are still in there.
[01:10:51.131 --> 01:10:51.731]  Back it up again.
[01:10:51.912 --> 01:10:52.172]  Show them.
[01:10:52.692 --> 01:10:53.453]  Just leave it up, guys.
[01:10:54.293 --> 01:10:56.275]  And you can see it was over a thousand people.
[01:10:56.295 --> 01:10:58.156]  We went and we actually brought people out to interview them.
[01:10:59.077 --> 01:11:05.862]  Now, when you look at the local media photos that they were showing, they were showing like two or three people at a table looking at merchandise.
[01:11:06.342 --> 01:11:10.485]  Then they showed the empty parking lot with a bunch of cars, but it was no people.
[01:11:10.505 --> 01:11:11.146]  Right.
[01:11:11.586 --> 01:11:12.346]  To show how the momentum is flowing.
[01:11:12.366 --> 01:11:13.647]  It was very carefully crafted.
[01:11:13.687 --> 01:11:14.308]  It was amazing.
[01:11:14.488 --> 01:11:34.450]  Yeah, and they've been saying all week, it's the worst week ever, it's the worst week of his 2016 race, thanks to the media, and you know, with this video with the reporter that was assaulted, I mean, we saw the video, but they're just playing it over and over again, and so they really have framed this narrative, and also talking about the numbers,
[01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:37.233]  You're on the GOP side.
[01:11:37.593 --> 01:11:41.517]  We have John Kasich, who has only won one state.
[01:11:41.557 --> 01:11:43.959]  Marco Rubio has more delegates than him.
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:49.465]  But yet for him, it's not impossible to get 108% of the delegates.
[01:11:49.745 --> 01:11:54.970]  Whereas if you look at Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the narrative is, Bernie, sorry, look at
[01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:59.033]  You're not going to win because math, like the math doesn't add up.
[01:11:59.053 --> 01:11:59.753]  You're not going to win.
[01:11:59.813 --> 01:12:02.675]  Just keep pushing that narrative for Hillary Clinton.
[01:12:02.995 --> 01:12:08.419]  Whereas on the other side, it's just there's still hope for these insurmountable odds.
[01:12:08.619 --> 01:12:14.043]  They'll do anything to make sure that their agenda, and again, we need to understand their agenda this time is open borders.
[01:12:14.643 --> 01:12:16.384]  It's these new trade treaties.
[01:12:16.604 --> 01:12:17.985]  It's the climate change treaties.
[01:12:18.405 --> 01:12:22.347]  Those are the three components that they need to pursue their globalism.
[01:12:22.667 --> 01:12:24.308]  And they can get that from Hillary Clinton.
[01:12:24.568 --> 01:12:26.049]  They can get that from Ted Cruz.
[01:12:26.089 --> 01:12:27.590]  He's already promoted those things.
[01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:29.051]  They can get that from John Kasich.
[01:12:29.431 --> 01:12:31.192]  They're not going to get it from Donald Trump.
[01:12:31.532 --> 01:12:32.493]  Not any of those three.
[01:12:32.833 --> 01:12:36.555]  And they can get most of those from Bernie Sanders without a problem.
[01:12:36.595 --> 01:12:39.916]  He's going to definitely jump in with both feet on the climate change treaty.
[01:12:40.257 --> 01:12:42.558]  When you come to the open borders, yeah, he's in on that too.
[01:12:43.058 --> 01:12:49.242]  He'll be a little bit reluctant on the trade treaties, but I think that he's not going to have the backbone to stand up to it.
[01:12:49.322 --> 01:12:51.583]  So they can pretty much have their way with him as well.
[01:12:51.643 --> 01:12:54.425]  But she's got the connections within the party.
[01:12:55.166 --> 01:12:57.907]  There was evidence in North Carolina.
[01:12:58.187 --> 01:13:03.130]  Again, Rob, the fellow that we talked to briefly there in UNC.
[01:13:04.477 --> 01:13:18.890]  He was talking about he was college students with Bernie Sanders and he kept telling us time and time again they have shut down events that were scheduled and it was the state party that was supposedly the state representatives for Bernie Sanders would shut this down.
[01:13:19.271 --> 01:13:26.978]  His take on it after he saw this the first couple of times I chalked it up to incompetence then I started to believe that they're really trying to sabotage the Bernie Sanders campaign.
[01:13:27.398 --> 01:13:40.804]  Because these people are career politicians and they want a job in the future in the Democrat Party in North Carolina and they are working with the party establishment to put forward the one who's anointed this time, which is Hillary Clinton.
[01:13:40.824 --> 01:13:42.045]  They don't care about the candidate.
[01:13:42.065 --> 01:13:42.505]  That's right.
[01:13:42.625 --> 01:13:46.787]  I saw that video and I actually sent that to you guys because I know you were in North Carolina at the time.
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:52.823]  And here's a guy who's just, he's working his butt off, believes in Bernie Sanders and what he's doing, even though I don't.
[01:13:53.844 --> 01:13:54.765]  But a lot of young kids do.
[01:13:54.805 --> 01:13:55.525]  But it's the process.
[01:13:55.545 --> 01:13:56.145]  It's the process.
[01:13:56.186 --> 01:14:02.189]  And he's learning, I think he's learning the hard way, like when he gets a job and starts paying taxes, he's going to start learning the hard way.
[01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:03.490]  Don't worry about socialism.
[01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:12.436]  It's easier to buy into that message because it's, you know, the hope and change that everyone wants until you actually get down to the nitty gritty and you're the one who's
[01:14:12.896 --> 01:14:16.059]  Yeah, he's from the Clinton rally right here.
[01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:16.999]  Let's go to this, guys.
[01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:17.920]  Let's pull that.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.041]  So there's the Clinton rally.
[01:14:19.081 --> 01:14:20.402]  Now go and play that, Carmen.
[01:14:20.882 --> 01:14:22.123]  So this is the Clinton rally.
[01:14:22.203 --> 01:14:24.345]  And then here's a Bernie Sanders rally.
[01:14:25.105 --> 01:14:28.548]  OK, he didn't fill the stadium, but there was at least twelve hundred people there, they thought.
[01:14:28.908 --> 01:14:29.149]  Yeah.
[01:14:29.649 --> 01:14:31.070]  Now I'm going to show you the pictures.
[01:14:31.731 --> 01:14:33.812]  Now, this is the supporters greet Trump.
[01:14:33.892 --> 01:14:35.173]  And it was Rothschild.
[01:14:36.494 --> 01:14:37.475]  So here's their photos.
[01:14:37.795 --> 01:14:38.656]  Look, look at the photos.
[01:14:39.036 --> 01:14:39.977]  Nothing, nothing.
[01:14:40.217 --> 01:14:40.878]  Oh, there's a person.
[01:14:41.198 --> 01:14:42.078]  Oh, there's a couple of people.
[01:14:43.039 --> 01:14:49.026]  Um, you know, and we just showed you the video of thousands of people in that very same spot.
[01:14:49.046 --> 01:14:49.386]  Right.
[01:14:49.406 --> 01:14:55.093]  And then they, then they showcased the lone protester standing behind the cameraman right there, the reporter.
[01:14:55.553 --> 01:14:56.995]  It's amazing how... The one protester with a sign.
[01:14:57.215 --> 01:14:59.277]  I mean, and that's the big, that's the big news there.
[01:14:59.377 --> 01:14:59.558]  Yeah.
[01:14:59.658 --> 01:14:59.838]  Okay.
[01:14:59.858 --> 01:15:00.258]  Yeah.
[01:15:00.759 --> 01:15:02.561]  And it's how they manipulate things too, Rob.
[01:15:02.601 --> 01:15:02.761]  Right.
[01:15:03.062 --> 01:15:04.003]  You know, there was this article
[01:15:05.003 --> 01:15:14.931]  We came out, I believe it was in Bloomberg last week, Drudge had it linked, and it was the confessions of a guy who had spent his entire career in Latin America rigging elections.
[01:15:15.151 --> 01:15:17.353]  And of course he's talking about the different things that he did.
[01:15:17.393 --> 01:15:21.036]  Now, some of the things that he did involved a lot of computer hacking.
[01:15:21.056 --> 01:15:29.543]  They would hack into electronic voting machines, they would hack into the laptops and the communications of their opponents, but he would also do stuff like
[01:15:30.223 --> 01:15:32.324]  ...have robocalls at 3 a.m.
[01:15:32.484 --> 01:15:36.325]  in the morning saying, vote for, and it would be his opponent.
[01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:38.525]  It's just to get people annoyed, okay?
[01:15:38.765 --> 01:15:39.825]  They would do things like that.
[01:15:39.885 --> 01:15:43.846]  They would play games and social media talking about momentum.
[01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:46.547]  This is how they control the elections.
[01:15:46.627 --> 01:15:52.789]  It's not just all going in with naked corruption in terms of stuffing the ballots or messing with the voting machines.
[01:15:52.829 --> 01:15:53.749]  That happens as well.
[01:15:54.269 --> 01:15:59.232]  But it's also the kind of tricks that you see the establishment, and I mean the full establishment.
[01:15:59.292 --> 01:16:06.176]  It's one entity, as Donald Trump's senior policy advisor said when they leaked that memo earlier today.
[01:16:07.517 --> 01:16:09.498]  The two of them are one and the same thing.
[01:16:09.518 --> 01:16:14.481]  It's the media as well as the GOP establishment, and they work together to sell this narrative.
[01:16:14.501 --> 01:16:19.505]  And right now, the narrative that they're going to be painting with everybody is that this small state that happens
[01:16:20.405 --> 01:16:25.186]  To be the only primary within a one-month period is really going to determine where the true momentum is.
[01:16:25.206 --> 01:16:32.128]  And I think it'd be farther from the truth when you got Donald Trump sitting with a 31-point lead in New York and a 20-point lead in Pennsylvania.
[01:16:32.168 --> 01:16:35.328]  I believe those states are winner-take-all, if I'm not mistaken.
[01:16:35.448 --> 01:16:44.630]  So, yeah, that's a big hurdle for Ted Cruz to get over that 31-point deficit to get to a plus 1% coming up.
[01:16:44.690 --> 01:16:46.611]  And, of course, he doesn't share New York values.
[01:16:46.731 --> 01:16:47.991]  That's going to come back to haunt him.
[01:16:48.999 --> 01:16:49.840]  Oh yeah, I agree.
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:54.322]  When he stuck his foot in his mouth in that debate, I said, you're not going to like that.
[01:16:54.342 --> 01:16:58.184]  People in New York all just went to the Trump box.
[01:16:58.585 --> 01:16:59.485]  That's right, yeah.
[01:16:59.665 --> 01:17:02.987]  It's going to come back to haunt him and it's going to stay there as well.
[01:17:03.047 --> 01:17:09.351]  And that's what they're seeing on the exit polls that so far it looks like Cruz has a little bit of an edge as well as Bernie Sanders.
[01:17:10.091 --> 01:17:11.452]  So that'll be pretty interesting.
[01:17:12.973 --> 01:17:23.678]  Leave this aura of uncertainty and they can play this little game of will there be contested convention or open convention and, you know, just continue with the ratings.
[01:17:23.718 --> 01:17:29.080]  I mean, so many people are really involved in this election cycle, even the young people who aren't even old enough to vote.
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.602]  Well, especially those people.
[01:17:31.843 --> 01:17:33.264]  They've got nothing but time on their hands.
[01:17:33.605 --> 01:17:45.558]  One of the things that I'm puzzled about, though, is in spite of all the polls that we've seen that show Cruz typically with a 3-5% lead in Wisconsin, I'm surprised that Donald Trump would be
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.581]  He's bringing up expectations for tonight.
[01:17:48.601 --> 01:17:52.383]  He's saying things like, I really believe tomorrow we're going to have a very, very big victory.
[01:17:52.463 --> 01:17:53.283]  Very, very big.
[01:17:53.444 --> 01:17:55.485]  You know, I've been up here a lot and I love it.
[01:17:55.605 --> 01:17:56.765]  And the people, I love them.
[01:17:57.066 --> 01:18:03.949]  Now he may be looking at the crowds that are there, but I'm really not sure why he is building expectations.
[01:18:04.049 --> 01:18:10.613]  I think that to a large degree, we just need to realize that Wisconsin is a GOP establishment push poll.
[01:18:11.408 --> 01:18:17.351]  That's where they're going to try to set up their narrative, and as I just mentioned, for the next two weeks we're going to be hearing about the results of this.
[01:18:17.691 --> 01:18:23.634]  Unless, of course, Donald Trump were to pull out a win, and I don't think they would be talking about it too much.
[01:18:23.934 --> 01:18:24.234]  Right.
[01:18:24.594 --> 01:18:35.019]  And yeah, I mean, that's what we're kind of seeing on the other side as well, is that they're, I mean, it'll be interesting to see if Sanders wins tonight, what we'll be hearing for the next few weeks about the math just doesn't add up.
[01:18:35.299 --> 01:18:38.742]  Well we've just gotten the very first results in with 1% in, Cruz at 54.8%, Trump at 38.8%.
[01:18:38.782 --> 01:18:41.084]  So that's almost a 55-39% difference there.
[01:18:41.144 --> 01:18:42.065]  Here's the other thing.
[01:18:50.589 --> 01:18:59.035]  When I was looking at the corruption in Brazil, and of course they're looking at their Marxist Socialist candidate about to be impeached.
[01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:11.744]  And she won two years ago in 2014 and everybody at the time said there was massive election corruption and it involved the voting machine company Smartmatic that was paid to run the Utah online voting.
[01:19:11.804 --> 01:19:12.504]  It was paid $80,000 by the GOP in Utah.
[01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:19.814]  Now, at the time that happened, everybody accused them of massive voter fraud.
[01:19:19.834 --> 01:19:23.697]  There was a company that typically did exit polling, and they took a powder.
[01:19:24.638 --> 01:19:33.265]  And she had been down by nine points in the run-up to the election, and she was also booed at the World Cup by 60,000 fans.
[01:19:33.565 --> 01:19:37.829]  They had massive corruption, massive economic problems in Brazil, and yet,
[01:19:38.349 --> 01:19:39.390]  On that day, she won.
[01:19:39.570 --> 01:19:43.452]  And the company that typically did exit polling didn't do any exit polling.
[01:19:43.812 --> 01:19:48.574]  But they were given massive government contracts right after, millions and millions of dollars.
[01:19:49.074 --> 01:20:05.242]  So the thing that concerns me is when I look at situations like Utah, and of course this is still just 1% in, it's started to change now, but if we see a radical difference between the polls that everybody has taken beforehand, and there's no exit polls because there were no exit polls in Utah,
[01:20:05.962 --> 01:20:10.564]  That is something that really concerns me, because that is a hallmark of election corruption.
[01:20:10.824 --> 01:20:23.230]  And if they want to monitor this situation, I really do think, even if he runs it himself, Donald Trump ought to start doing some exit polls in some of these places, especially the places where there are caucuses, because that's where there's a lot of dirty tricks involved.
[01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:27.195]  Now we've got up to 2% and it is changing again.
[01:20:27.276 --> 01:20:28.197]  It's now 53-31.
[01:20:28.237 --> 01:20:31.121]  So it's even greater for Ted Cruz.
[01:20:31.141 --> 01:20:38.512]  So here we had a situation where there was a 3 or 4 point difference and now that has exploded into a 20 point difference overnight.
[01:20:39.293 --> 01:20:39.993]  I don't believe it.
[01:20:40.173 --> 01:20:40.754]  I don't believe it.
[01:20:40.834 --> 01:20:45.916]  And we have seen this now three or four times in these states that Ted Cruz has won.
[01:20:46.876 --> 01:20:58.981]  The day before, we've got Donald Trump even or up by five, sometimes ten points, and then the next day, it's a caucus state or whatever, Ted Cruz gets a twenty point win.
[01:20:59.481 --> 01:21:00.401]  And I don't believe that.
[01:21:00.861 --> 01:21:02.622]  And I really honestly don't believe that.
[01:21:02.642 --> 01:21:07.644]  And we know that these elections can easily be rigged in a variety of different ways.
[01:21:08.464 --> 01:21:10.626]  And it depends on where these results are coming from, too.
[01:21:10.946 --> 01:21:11.206]  Right.
[01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:16.951]  And so, earlier they were saying with the exit polls that Trump had a slight lead.
[01:21:16.991 --> 01:21:22.135]  I'm trying to find the actual quote out of this article, but... Yeah, that was one polling organization.
[01:21:22.155 --> 01:21:22.736]  That was earlier today.
[01:21:22.756 --> 01:21:24.397]  We talked about that today, yeah.
[01:21:24.597 --> 01:21:29.261]  And that organization has called some very accurately.
[01:21:29.281 --> 01:21:31.683]  It had six states that they'd called very accurately.
[01:21:32.124 --> 01:21:34.806]  But they did miss significantly on some other states.
[01:21:34.866 --> 01:21:36.767]  They had one state that they'd called for Kasich.
[01:21:37.768 --> 01:21:38.109]  I don't know.
[01:21:58.522 --> 01:22:01.164]  And it was a sample of 6,200 people.
[01:22:01.224 --> 01:22:04.806]  Most of these polls have between four and seven hundred people as their sample.
[01:22:05.527 --> 01:22:10.370]  And that gives them a margin of error of about four to six percent, typically.
[01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.770]  Okay?
[01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:13.071]  This poll had 6,200 people.
[01:22:13.091 --> 01:22:16.674]  It had a margin of error of one percent, and it showed Donald Trump up by two points.
[01:22:16.734 --> 01:22:19.415]  But of course, that was about ten days ago.
[01:22:19.636 --> 01:22:19.796]  Right.
[01:22:20.765 --> 01:22:32.373]  Yeah, well, it'll be very interesting as we've been seeing them absolutely beating him in the media, just playing things over and over again, even though we saw one very clear video of the reporter's arm being grabbed.
[01:22:32.473 --> 01:22:32.653]  Yeah.
[01:22:32.853 --> 01:22:38.037]  There was no twitching and shaking or jolting there with the frame by frames.
[01:22:38.077 --> 01:22:43.600]  And then they come out with this, oh, this new video shows a new angle and it's missing frames.
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:50.565]  And so it looks like she's being yanked, but that's because in one frame she's here and then in the next frame, everyone's, you know, a few feet
[01:22:51.526 --> 01:23:15.226]  I mean, to me, that was just so upsetting, but you could see how they could play that out, and now that was one of the big things that they were saying with the radio broadcasters there in Wisconsin, that women just really don't like Trump after that, and that the women there in Wisconsin, they hold themselves with class and decorum, they think, and kindness, which they don't see that as Donald Trump.
[01:23:15.346 --> 01:23:18.929]  I was listening to local talk radio as I was driving in this morning.
[01:23:19.589 --> 01:23:19.749]  Yes.
[01:23:35.422 --> 01:23:35.983]  I don't know.
[01:23:55.545 --> 01:23:57.407]  Uh, are not looking at the evidence.
[01:23:57.447 --> 01:23:58.587]  They're listening to the narrative.
[01:24:25.685 --> 01:24:29.967]  And of course the Secret Service said she got in between them and their protectees.
[01:24:29.987 --> 01:24:31.988]  She was in an area where she was not supposed to be.
[01:24:32.068 --> 01:24:36.069]  Everything about that is phony, but we see these phony narratives over and again.
[01:24:36.089 --> 01:24:45.994]  The judge is calling it now for Sanders and Cruz take Wisconsin, which that's pretty surprising because they were saying that these are the two candidates vying to take down the party's frontrunners.
[01:24:46.394 --> 01:24:50.695]  I'll be very interested to see if Hillary Clinton is going to give a speech or Sanders.
[01:24:50.735 --> 01:24:51.436]  I'm sure they will.
[01:24:52.656 --> 01:24:56.798]  Well, I don't know how Ted Cruz gets a 26 point lead overnight.
[01:24:57.278 --> 01:25:06.261]  I don't know how he goes from all the polls showing him between 2 to 5% lead and all of a sudden, and I think real clear average was 3% up.
[01:25:06.481 --> 01:25:09.402]  And so he was 3% up and now all of a sudden he is 26% up.
[01:25:09.422 --> 01:25:09.922]  I'm telling you.
[01:25:11.663 --> 01:25:14.187]  This is the GOP establishment.
[01:25:14.367 --> 01:25:16.009]  They are crooked thieves.
[01:25:16.069 --> 01:25:19.513]  They need to be investigated as part of the RICO statute.
[01:25:19.814 --> 01:25:26.262]  Racketeered influence, corrupt organizations, nothing could better describe the GOP.
[01:25:26.723 --> 01:25:27.684]  That's what we have now.
[01:25:27.824 --> 01:25:29.326]  And these people are willing to burn down their parties.
[01:25:30.286 --> 01:25:42.012]  3% of the counties and you can see here on the map that it's you know there's still a lot of people have yet to get in but I guess with the votes tallied they're already gonna go ahead and call it based on the exit polls there.
[01:25:42.032 --> 01:25:51.697]  That looks like Milwaukee going up to Green Bay and then way up north I'm not sure what county or what big cities are up there.
[01:25:53.905 --> 01:25:54.928]  So just looking at that map.
[01:25:55.088 --> 01:26:01.524]  Hey, going back to Michelle Fields, apparently in her police report she put she was attacked with hands, teeth, and feet.
[01:26:03.203 --> 01:26:03.643]  No.
[01:26:03.683 --> 01:26:08.045]  That's clearly, unless I read something wrong on the internet, somebody had put that out on Twitter.
[01:26:08.085 --> 01:26:15.467]  Well I know she said that she was yanked to the ground initially and she had to and then she was like well no I just I was pulled and I had to catch myself.
[01:26:15.867 --> 01:26:30.032]  This to me is a case, talk about check your privilege, she needs to check her pretty girl privilege because that's what I think is that she's like used to this, she's a beautiful reporter and she just was like I'm gonna go up there and get this question and the
[01:26:30.492 --> 01:26:34.315]  I think the Secret Service had asked her, you know, several times to step away from him.
[01:26:34.335 --> 01:26:35.155]  Megyn Kelly's not pretty.
[01:26:35.416 --> 01:26:38.458]  And she didn't listen to the Secret Service.
[01:26:38.578 --> 01:26:40.159]  She's not used to being told no.
[01:26:40.239 --> 01:26:45.743]  And she was like, I'm gonna get, you know, and I feel like she just needs to check her pretty girl privilege.
[01:26:45.763 --> 01:26:52.047]  Well, what I was amazed at of these female reporters was what Megyn Kelly was saying this week with her interview with Charlie Rose.
[01:26:52.588 --> 01:26:53.629]  Saying she was angry.
[01:26:54.429 --> 01:27:10.702]  That Bill O'Reilly had not supported her, but even more important, I thought that was absolutely amazing, that she believed that CNN should not have broadcast Donald Trump having that rally with the veterans when he boycotted the debate with Fox News.
[01:27:10.722 --> 01:27:12.624]  She said, we all need to stand up to this guy.
[01:27:12.884 --> 01:27:14.726]  He should be banned from television.
[01:27:14.966 --> 01:27:16.327]  It's important for the First Amendment.
[01:27:17.466 --> 01:27:22.128]  Now, do you understand you don't ban people from television and say that's supporting the First Amendment?
[01:27:22.248 --> 01:27:31.971]  I don't know where this lady belongs, but if Fox News wants to say that they are a conservative or constitutional-friendly network, and I don't believe that they are for a moment.
[01:27:32.011 --> 01:27:34.632]  Rupert Murdoch has given the maximum to Hillary Clinton.
[01:27:34.652 --> 01:27:38.513]  He's in with the GOP of the Democrat establishment.
[01:27:40.214 --> 01:27:50.980]  You know, if they're going to present themselves as conservatives, as libertarians, first of all, the idea that she needs to be defended by her male co-workers, okay?
[01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:52.641]  She's the strong woman here.
[01:27:53.381 --> 01:27:58.164]  And then the fact that she's calling for a boycott in the name of the First Amendment
[01:27:58.624 --> 01:28:00.045]  We need to teach him a lesson.
[01:28:00.185 --> 01:28:03.586]  It's all about her, this egocentric woman.
[01:28:03.966 --> 01:28:10.429]  She shows up at this event in Wisconsin to help Ted Cruz, and she's wearing $1,200 Prada shoes.
[01:28:10.469 --> 01:28:13.631]  And I saw that, said to my wife, the devil wears Prada.
[01:28:14.071 --> 01:28:14.951]  That's it, right there.
[01:28:15.051 --> 01:28:19.413]  You know, she's got these stiletto heels, and I think that needs to be her new nickname.
[01:28:19.654 --> 01:28:22.235]  We should start calling Megyn Kelly Stiletto Heel.
[01:28:23.115 --> 01:28:25.237]  Because that's what she is.
[01:28:25.297 --> 01:28:26.398]  She's just the Leto heel.
[01:28:26.418 --> 01:28:27.279]  The Leto heel.
[01:28:27.499 --> 01:28:28.300]  But that's the privilege.
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:39.791]  That's the privilege of these anchors who see themselves as celebrities, that everything is about them, and that the candidates, Donald Trump or whoever, need to bow and scrape before them.
[01:28:40.071 --> 01:28:41.833]  I mean, that's just absolutely amazing.
[01:28:42.236 --> 01:28:42.456]  Right.
[01:28:42.676 --> 01:28:44.397]  Well, she's already kind of putting it out there.
[01:28:44.477 --> 01:28:50.720]  She might not stay on with Fox News once her contract expires because she's become part of the story now.
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.300]  That's right.
[01:28:51.441 --> 01:28:51.661]  Yeah.
[01:28:51.861 --> 01:28:52.181]  Oh, yeah.
[01:28:52.201 --> 01:28:53.922]  She can start her own network, I guess.
[01:28:53.942 --> 01:28:54.222]  I don't know.
[01:28:55.674 --> 01:28:57.635]  Well, she's got top ratings, you know.
[01:28:58.475 --> 01:29:07.418]  So I'm not, this isn't really these results, there's still only 4% coming in, and Drudge has called it, although some of the other sites have not, CNN, Fox News.
[01:29:07.838 --> 01:29:11.459]  Well, it's a consistently at least 20 point spread that we're seeing there now.
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:14.460]  Right now it's 50.9 to 32.1, so it's like 51 to 32, so we're looking at about 19 points there.
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.801]  And so we got 42 delegates to be won on the Republican side, 96.
[01:29:24.944 --> 01:29:28.485]  In Wisconsin, so there's 86 pledged and 10 superdelegates.
[01:29:28.505 --> 01:29:32.227]  96 total.
[01:29:32.507 --> 01:29:33.687]  So it'll be interesting to see.
[01:29:33.707 --> 01:29:35.828]  And then it gets split up by congressional districts.
[01:29:35.928 --> 01:29:36.248]  Yeah.
[01:29:36.348 --> 01:29:37.189]  They start dividing them.
[01:29:37.209 --> 01:29:37.929]  Some proportionals.
[01:29:37.969 --> 01:29:41.530]  I just want to know where all these Ted Cruz voters are or were.
[01:29:41.970 --> 01:29:42.371]  Yeah.
[01:29:42.391 --> 01:29:43.131]  We never found any.
[01:29:43.331 --> 01:29:45.032]  They're in the voting machine software.
[01:29:45.112 --> 01:29:45.792]  I think so.
[01:29:45.892 --> 01:29:47.413]  I think it's flipping it, honestly.
[01:29:47.513 --> 01:29:48.153]  Oh, I do too.
[01:29:48.773 --> 01:29:50.914]  Again, I do not see how you go from a
[01:29:51.454 --> 01:29:58.598]  A real clear politics average of three points up to all of a sudden the next day you win by 20 to 30 percent.
[01:29:58.958 --> 01:29:59.318]  Sorry.
[01:29:59.778 --> 01:30:00.078]  Sorry.
[01:30:00.098 --> 01:30:01.099]  Doesn't work.
[01:30:01.139 --> 01:30:04.761]  And we're not going to see any exit polls just like we didn't see any exit polls in Utah.
[01:30:05.021 --> 01:30:06.182]  I guarantee you we're not going to see it.
[01:30:06.482 --> 01:30:09.003]  Here's another thing in terms of the way the media is set up.
[01:30:09.063 --> 01:30:14.746]  We see that Roger Stone has been banned from CNN after he tweeted negative comments.
[01:30:14.766 --> 01:30:15.886]  That happened a couple of weeks ago.
[01:30:16.587 --> 01:30:18.047]  Now there's a new controversy.
[01:30:18.188 --> 01:30:20.229]  MSNBC cut short his interview.
[01:30:21.389 --> 01:30:24.130]  And he was saying things that they thought were really dangerous.
[01:30:24.190 --> 01:30:39.417]  He was saying, well, if Trump does not run the table to the rest of the primaries and the caucuses, we're looking at a very, very no path in which the kingmakers go all out to cheat, steal, snatch this nomination from the candidate who is overwhelmingly selected by the voters, which is why I've urged Trump supporters to come to Cleveland.
[01:30:39.537 --> 01:30:41.678]  Wow, how controversial can you get?
[01:30:41.978 --> 01:30:42.979]  And he goes on to say,
[01:30:43.999 --> 01:30:53.981]  He goes on to say, we're going to disclose the hotels and the room numbers, the delegates who are directly involved in the steal, so people who come to Cleveland can go there and talk to them.
[01:30:54.041 --> 01:30:55.342]  Well, we wouldn't want to have that happen.
[01:30:55.362 --> 01:30:56.522]  Yeah, we wouldn't want them to.
[01:30:56.582 --> 01:31:02.763]  It's almost like you would go to Washington and talk to your majesty, your congressman who is over and above you.
[01:31:02.823 --> 01:31:05.984]  I mean, you know, this is their party and we should not be crashing
[01:31:06.644 --> 01:31:08.045]  ...writes Priebus' party.
[01:31:08.105 --> 01:31:11.288]  It's his party, and we're trying to join his party.
[01:31:11.888 --> 01:31:13.190]  And he's going to have the final decision.
[01:31:13.290 --> 01:31:14.951]  And sit down if you don't like the party.
[01:31:14.991 --> 01:31:17.453]  If you've got some problems with the way they're running things.
[01:31:17.473 --> 01:31:18.294]  Just shut up and sit down.
[01:31:18.314 --> 01:31:21.356]  Yeah, and they're going to make some new rules at this convention.
[01:31:21.477 --> 01:31:28.342]  Don't ask them about the old rules, and if they should go with the Romney rules of 2012, because these are new.
[01:31:28.623 --> 01:31:33.347]  And so nobody knows what's going to happen, but if you don't like the party, then sit down.
[01:31:33.367 --> 01:31:35.048]  Because they're choosing the candidate.
[01:31:35.128 --> 01:31:43.835]  Well, it didn't work out too well for Mitt Romney when they played that game and kept Ron Paul's name from being a nomination so that they could keep him from making a speech.
[01:31:43.915 --> 01:31:48.739]  That kind of over-the-top arrogance is what is going to be fatal to the GOP.
[01:31:48.779 --> 01:31:55.784]  Now, that's going to cost them the election and let Hillary come in, but they're fine with that because that gets them all three of their globalist goals.
[01:31:55.844 --> 01:31:56.004]  Right.
[01:31:56.384 --> 01:31:57.605]  But it's also going to destroy the party.
[01:31:57.665 --> 01:32:01.468]  They're willing to burn down the party, as I reported in the fourth hour earlier today,
[01:32:02.429 --> 01:32:12.895]  The IMF is talking about how they need to create an economic crisis and they need to do it right about the time of the Brexit election, you know, whether they talk about whether or not Britain wants to exit the EU.
[01:32:12.935 --> 01:32:17.718]  They need to do it right at that time so they can control the narrative.
[01:32:17.758 --> 01:32:19.999]  They're willing to burn down the economy of Europe
[01:32:20.459 --> 01:32:22.861]  I'm telling you they're willing to burn down the GOP.
[01:32:23.442 --> 01:32:29.186]  And I'll give them a match if they want to burn down the GOP because I think we need a new political party.
[01:32:29.466 --> 01:32:33.730]  I think we need to have a multi-party democracy, not a two-party duopoly.
[01:32:34.090 --> 01:32:35.992]  I'm sick and tired of what they have done.
[01:32:36.052 --> 01:32:42.377]  I've watched this from a third-party standpoint and it thoroughly made me sick with both major parties.
[01:32:42.397 --> 01:32:48.842]  And now I think the general population is seeing this with both Sanders and with Trump, the way they rig these elections.
[01:32:48.902 --> 01:32:49.862]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:32:49.922 --> 01:32:54.245]  And we're definitely seeing the chaos that's going around globally.
[01:32:54.485 --> 01:32:58.927]  And we know they want their new world order that they're going to form out of this chaos.
[01:32:59.267 --> 01:33:04.650]  And we see Soros has his fingers everywhere and his funds everywhere.
[01:33:04.670 --> 01:33:06.330]  There's any kind of unrest going on.
[01:33:06.811 --> 01:33:07.011]  He's
[01:33:07.731 --> 01:33:07.871]  Yeah.
[01:33:38.131 --> 01:33:42.254]  But they're also still kind of going well, we're we're in control of this too.
[01:33:42.294 --> 01:33:46.077]  So I've watched this for a long time I've watched how they control access to the media.
[01:33:46.317 --> 01:34:06.670]  I've watched how they use the media to establish their narrative I've watched how they control access to the ballots keeping independents and third parties off making them jump through hoops and spend Tremendous amount of resources just to get on the ballot which they don't have to spend a penny on I've watched how they have waived the rules for the mainstream political parties and then
[01:34:08.091 --> 01:34:11.532]  Tell them to the nth degree for anybody who's a third party or political candidate.
[01:34:11.552 --> 01:34:13.073]  So I've watched how they've controlled the ballots.
[01:34:13.353 --> 01:34:14.233]  I'm sorry, the debates.
[01:34:14.593 --> 01:34:17.494]  Even after you get on the ballot, they will not let you into the debate.
[01:34:17.534 --> 01:34:21.295]  And what we've got coming up, people need to be aware of this as well and get angry about it.
[01:34:22.236 --> 01:34:32.539]  When we have the debates that are coming up, the presidential debates, of course, the threshold has been established after they had Ross Perot come in and temporarily take the lead as a third party independent.
[01:34:32.979 --> 01:34:35.900]  He's a, I guess he was an independent before he was reform party.
[01:34:37.110 --> 01:34:41.171]  Third party or independent, he took the lead there briefly because he got into the debates.
[01:34:41.531 --> 01:34:46.333]  And so to keep that from happening, they brought the threshold up to 15% in the polls.
[01:34:46.933 --> 01:34:50.814]  And so we haven't had another three-way debate in a presidential election since then.
[01:34:50.854 --> 01:34:53.075]  Now we've watched debate after debate.
[01:34:53.615 --> 01:34:53.995]  We're good to go.
[01:35:14.195 --> 01:35:15.095]  With all of those candidates.
[01:35:15.115 --> 01:35:21.737]  We're talking about having candidates who are on enough ballots nationwide that they have a mathematical chance to win.
[01:35:22.398 --> 01:35:23.778]  So you're on maybe 40, 50.
[01:35:24.018 --> 01:35:26.819]  If you're on 50 ballots, you've got a chance to win.
[01:35:27.399 --> 01:35:28.980]  If they will let you speak.
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:32.703]  But they control this narrative and they're going to set this up at 15%.
[01:35:33.063 --> 01:35:38.828]  So I've seen all of these different tactics and of course that's not even talking about the way they count the votes like we're seeing tonight.
[01:35:38.848 --> 01:35:39.188]  Right.
[01:35:39.208 --> 01:35:44.433]  And not verifying it with exit pollings or you can manipulate the ballots electronically.
[01:35:45.033 --> 01:35:48.296]  There's not any careful control of the custody of the votes.
[01:35:48.336 --> 01:35:51.338]  There's not a careful control of who has the ballots.
[01:35:51.358 --> 01:35:53.040]  We've seen these types of reports from Utah.
[01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:55.762]  So there's so many different ways that they can rig the election.
[01:35:55.942 --> 01:36:06.705]  Well, and the thing that's so interesting is that it's only somewhere someone was like, you know what, let's go ahead and have some caucuses out there and just throw the voters a bone and let them feel like they've got something going on.
[01:36:06.745 --> 01:36:12.167]  But really, it doesn't even matter because everything's so confusing with the delegates and how they are proportionally
[01:36:13.228 --> 01:36:13.608]  I don't
[01:36:29.769 --> 01:36:30.850]  Full-on establishment.
[01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:35.213]  They're writing the rules to ensure that their candidate wins.
[01:36:35.493 --> 01:36:36.694]  You know what it reminds me of, Leanne?
[01:36:37.434 --> 01:36:47.220]  Whenever you look at these political establishments, whether it's a party or a candidate or even a super PAC, they'll always send you a questionnaire.
[01:36:47.881 --> 01:36:49.742]  And it'll be an issues-based questionnaire.
[01:36:49.762 --> 01:36:52.384]  And we say, we would like for you to take this poll.
[01:36:53.410 --> 01:36:56.512]  We'd like for you to check what you think are the most important issues.
[01:36:56.913 --> 01:36:58.174]  What do you think about this issue?
[01:36:58.214 --> 01:36:59.335]  What do you think about that issue?
[01:36:59.715 --> 01:37:01.096]  They could care less.
[01:37:01.296 --> 01:37:04.479]  They simply want to get your name and your donation.
[01:37:04.979 --> 01:37:12.104]  And they imply that when you send this in, in order for it to be counted, they need to have some money to fund their counting.
[01:37:12.605 --> 01:37:15.567]  So that's what these things are really about.
[01:37:15.627 --> 01:37:20.171]  It's to give you a false sense of control, a false sense of belonging.
[01:37:20.791 --> 01:37:22.472]  So that you will play the game.
[01:37:22.492 --> 01:37:22.952]  Right.
[01:37:22.992 --> 01:37:35.236]  Now what has changed this time around is that Donald Trump, having the financial resources and having the media savvy that he has had, has been able to go outside of the system the way nobody else has been able to do it before.
[01:37:35.256 --> 01:37:35.556]  Right.
[01:37:35.596 --> 01:37:43.078]  And so what has really changed this time, and it's the first time I've seen it my entire life, all the rest of this stuff is standard operating procedure for these crooks.
[01:37:43.438 --> 01:37:44.859]  For these Rico crooks.
[01:37:46.135 --> 01:37:57.799]  What's changed this time is the fact that you've got all these people from Reince Priebus to these other RNC officials saying, we don't know why we have caucuses and primaries.
[01:37:57.859 --> 01:37:58.820]  It really doesn't matter.
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:37:59.880]  We're going to pick the voters.
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:00.560]  It's our party.
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:03.001]  We don't really care what you choose.
[01:38:03.021 --> 01:38:04.422]  We don't need to give you the illusion.
[01:38:04.702 --> 01:38:05.142]  Exactly.
[01:38:05.162 --> 01:38:12.525]  We've never had them pull that mask down and openly confess to being racketeering gangsters.
[01:38:12.845 --> 01:38:14.826]  And that's what Priebus and these people
[01:38:15.646 --> 01:38:19.207]  Wisconsin is the core of these racketeering gangsters.
[01:38:19.427 --> 01:38:19.947]  It really is.
[01:38:20.447 --> 01:38:26.109]  So it's not a surprise to see this situation where all of a sudden he's jumped from a 3-point lead to a 20-point lead.
[01:38:26.289 --> 01:38:28.049]  And we won't have any exit polling, I guarantee it.
[01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.389]  Right.
[01:38:28.849 --> 01:38:35.631]  Well, and that's, I mean, that's, to me, it just shows that their global plan is very near completion.
[01:38:35.851 --> 01:38:38.012]  They've ramped everything up in the last few years.
[01:38:38.052 --> 01:38:41.613]  This could very well be our last election, you know, that we have.
[01:38:41.713 --> 01:38:46.454]  They've pulled the mask off and they're saying, your vote really doesn't matter.
[01:38:46.754 --> 01:38:50.235]  We're going to let you know who you're allowed to vote for, which we've always known.
[01:38:50.255 --> 01:38:54.736]  I mean, we've said this a lot, you know, which is why a lot of people are like, I don't vote.
[01:38:54.756 --> 01:38:55.396]  I don't even care.
[01:38:55.817 --> 01:39:00.978]  But here they're really just showing you like it's done and who knows how it's going to be the next time around.
[01:39:01.178 --> 01:39:01.358]  Yeah.
[01:39:01.518 --> 01:39:02.459]  Well, I always vote.
[01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:04.602]  I've always known it's a corrupt system.
[01:39:05.102 --> 01:39:07.645]  And the more I got involved in it, the more I knew it was a corrupt system.
[01:39:08.126 --> 01:39:12.310]  But I vote because I refuse to let them think that I don't care.
[01:39:13.051 --> 01:39:20.079]  And even if they're going to stuff the ballot with another five bogus votes to wipe out my vote, I want them to know they've got to do that.
[01:39:20.319 --> 01:39:21.660]  I want to get my vote in there.
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:24.201]  I want to express my preference to them.
[01:39:24.261 --> 01:39:27.923]  I want to say it to their face, even if it doesn't change anything.
[01:39:27.963 --> 01:39:32.505]  I'm going to get in their face and I'm going to say, I'm not voting for your candidate.
[01:39:32.565 --> 01:39:35.247]  And so I've always taken that very seriously.
[01:39:35.307 --> 01:39:42.110]  And I know at some level, somebody sees there's a vote there that they've got to counteract with their software or whatever.
[01:39:42.270 --> 01:40:09.651]  Yeah, or toss it away, which is another reason why it's so important to go to Cleveland, if you can be there, to show your presence and to be able to, when the media says, oh look at this one person that showed up to the Trump rally, and you're there yourself with your own camera, your own video, uploading it to social media saying, well there's actually thousands of people here, so here's your media narrative busted and your agenda is on full display.
[01:40:10.191 --> 01:40:20.620]  And so even if they do end up stealing the vote and going with who they want rather than who the voters really want, I mean, at least you are an eyewitness to what is going on.
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:21.981]  The veil will be lifted.
[01:40:22.001 --> 01:40:27.425]  There's no more duping yourself and hoping that, you know, they've got your best interests at heart.
[01:40:27.465 --> 01:40:29.447]  Like, the truth will be there.
[01:40:29.507 --> 01:40:31.308]  You will be fully aware at that moment.
[01:40:31.849 --> 01:40:32.749]  And let me say this too.
[01:40:33.815 --> 01:40:35.798]  I don't throw out elections completely.
[01:40:35.918 --> 01:40:42.988]  I do believe that trying to get somebody in at the presidential level is, for the most part, a Sisyphus task.
[01:40:43.549 --> 01:40:46.673]  And it's going to be a Pyrrhic victory in most cases.
[01:40:46.733 --> 01:40:48.896]  But I think you can make a big difference
[01:40:50.054 --> 01:40:50.815]  At the local level.
[01:40:51.636 --> 01:40:58.582]  Some places there's a lot of corruption at the local level, but in other places you really can have an honest election for some things like sheriff and that sort of thing.
[01:40:58.783 --> 01:41:03.467]  And you can get some very important positions filled if you've got the right people.
[01:41:03.487 --> 01:41:08.212]  If you've got people with backbone, people who will stand up the Constitution and a community that will stand with them.
[01:41:08.452 --> 01:41:13.176]  There's a lot of value in the local elections and even in some parts of state elections.
[01:41:13.877 --> 01:41:28.631]  But I think the key thing that we all need to understand in order to get our freedom, the key thing we need to understand is if you get people educated about juries, if you do jury nullification, you only need one vote out of 12.
[01:41:30.031 --> 01:41:32.332]  To cover your neighbor, okay?
[01:41:32.372 --> 01:41:33.992]  And that's what we need to get people to understand.
[01:41:34.192 --> 01:41:42.835]  We can cover ourselves from tyrannical government at the local, the state, and the federal level if we understand the power of the jury box.
[01:41:42.935 --> 01:41:45.616]  And that's where we really need to have a grassroots movement.
[01:41:45.696 --> 01:41:47.536]  I believe that's really the true solution.
[01:41:47.576 --> 01:41:50.717]  Things like that, as opposed to trying to get this top-down solution.
[01:41:50.877 --> 01:41:55.819]  If we all understood our rights, if we were willing to stand up for them and stand up for our neighbor at the jury box,
[01:41:56.599 --> 01:42:03.046]  I think we would have a grassroots, from the grassroots up to the top, I think we would have a true revolution for liberty at that point.
[01:42:03.286 --> 01:42:04.708]  It really is an educational issue.
[01:42:04.908 --> 01:42:06.890]  Yeah, I agree with you absolutely.
[01:42:07.190 --> 01:42:17.061]  And that's the one thing with this election that I think is so wonderful, either way you look at it, is that people are starting to understand how the system works.
[01:42:17.381 --> 01:42:20.762]  He's saying for the first time, what's a delegate, or what does that mean?
[01:42:21.102 --> 01:42:29.185]  And you watch these things on the news, but no one has ever really been, I mean, people are so involved on both sides for Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.
[01:42:29.465 --> 01:42:36.747]  People that have never voted before, that never have cared, are actually now paying attention going, why am I watching this caucus?
[01:42:36.787 --> 01:42:38.308]  Why are they covering this on the news?
[01:42:38.368 --> 01:42:39.368]  What are these delegates?
[01:42:39.688 --> 01:42:44.950]  Wait a minute, why is my candidate, he won that state, but Hillary's getting the delegates?
[01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.710]  I don't understand.
[01:42:46.190 --> 01:42:58.184]  So, you know, people are starting to really pay attention to the process and I think they are going to start taking, paying better attention on the local level with the jury nullification and the things that you can do on the local level.
[01:42:58.605 --> 01:43:01.388]  And that's, I mean, they have not wanted us.
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:03.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:43:24.696 --> 01:43:28.719]  You know, he says he wants to break up the big banks, but he doesn't have a plan for how he's going to do it.
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:33.063]  He wants to take out Hillary Clinton, but he, you know, kowtows to her.
[01:43:33.143 --> 01:43:34.344]  He doesn't have a backbone.
[01:43:34.424 --> 01:43:34.944]  He doesn't.
[01:43:35.325 --> 01:43:36.326]  He has no plan for it.
[01:43:37.406 --> 01:43:41.167]  Well, I mean, looking at Sanders and Clinton, they haven't called it here.
[01:43:41.327 --> 01:43:45.389]  It's only about a 5% difference.
[01:43:45.449 --> 01:43:46.189]  And they still haven't called.
[01:43:46.209 --> 01:43:52.111]  They have called the race for Cruz because he's got this magical 21 point lead now.
[01:43:52.671 --> 01:43:54.131]  Just appeared out of nowhere.
[01:43:54.732 --> 01:43:55.832]  That's great.
[01:43:56.994 --> 01:43:58.575]  24% in, ole Cruz.
[01:43:58.715 --> 01:44:05.661]  You guys, I found a Washington Post poll that actually has, because they were saying Trump was doing horrible with women.
[01:44:05.821 --> 01:44:06.482]  He was abysmal.
[01:44:07.082 --> 01:44:11.866]  This is showing him 29 to 22 with Cruz, you know, beating Cruz.
[01:44:12.026 --> 01:44:12.627]  With women.
[01:44:12.887 --> 01:44:13.127]  Yeah.
[01:44:13.167 --> 01:44:13.648]  With women.
[01:44:13.968 --> 01:44:14.728]  Well, that's just it.
[01:44:14.829 --> 01:44:17.230]  It'll be interesting to see if there's any exit polling.
[01:44:17.791 --> 01:44:23.335]  When I was looking at the early exit polling that was being reported by MSNBC earlier on, they were
[01:44:24.236 --> 01:44:32.638]  Taking polls of people who had gone on their way to work and people at lunchtime, and they were looking at the demographics of the people who had shown up to vote.
[01:44:32.678 --> 01:44:35.378]  And those demographics looked very favorable to Trump at that time.
[01:44:35.478 --> 01:44:36.839]  So, I don't know.
[01:44:37.139 --> 01:44:41.600]  You know, you look at the results and I would take it with a grain of salt because of where this is.
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:44.160]  This is an establishment center.
[01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:46.721]  I mean, this is like winning Washington, D.C.
[01:44:47.841 --> 01:44:49.502]  Which Marco Rubio did, okay?
[01:44:50.022 --> 01:44:52.104]  And this is the Washington D.C.
[01:44:52.284 --> 01:44:53.084]  of the GOP.
[01:44:53.164 --> 01:44:59.328]  This is the establishment that is antithetical to everything the GOP voters have wanted.
[01:44:59.968 --> 01:45:06.331]  Everything, we keep telling them what the issues are, they campaign on these issues, we elect them on the issues, and they throw the issues away immediately.
[01:45:06.952 --> 01:45:09.293]  And now they do that, they're going to do that with our candidate.
[01:45:09.533 --> 01:45:12.635]  After we pick a candidate from the outside, they're going to throw that candidate away as well.
[01:45:13.174 --> 01:45:22.620]  Yeah, well, and so I guess this is a hybrid delegate allocation, so they're going to be awarding these by district.
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:25.822]  There'll be some congressional districts.
[01:45:25.962 --> 01:45:30.505]  I think the winner will get a clump of delegates and then they'll go district by district.
[01:45:30.725 --> 01:45:33.667]  And then Ted Cruz will come in with his lawyers and he will steal.
[01:45:35.108 --> 01:45:35.969]  Whatever is left over.
[01:45:36.169 --> 01:45:38.310]  He's like some kind of a hyena, you know, after the kill.
[01:45:38.350 --> 01:45:38.591]  Right.
[01:45:38.691 --> 01:45:41.173]  He's kind of a master with this whole delegate system.
[01:45:41.193 --> 01:45:43.515]  Donald Trump comes in and he's like the lion.
[01:45:43.955 --> 01:45:51.241]  He kills it and, you know, he's got the delegates and then Ted Cruz kind of sneaks in like a hyena.
[01:45:51.281 --> 01:45:51.862]  Hyena, yeah.
[01:45:51.882 --> 01:45:53.403]  Coming after the hair and stuff like that.
[01:45:55.598 --> 01:45:57.279]  I like that bad lip-reading video.
[01:45:57.299 --> 01:45:57.800]  He likes hair.
[01:45:57.820 --> 01:45:59.181]  I like hair.
[01:45:59.761 --> 01:46:00.842]  Yeah.
[01:46:00.882 --> 01:46:02.263]  Carcasses and caucuses.
[01:46:02.363 --> 01:46:02.683]  Yes.
[01:46:03.143 --> 01:46:10.208]  Always wondered how did they do such a good job with those lip-reading things, because it looks like they're really talking like that.
[01:46:10.228 --> 01:46:14.852]  They really got his voice down on that comedy parody.
[01:46:14.872 --> 01:46:15.012]  Yeah.
[01:46:15.052 --> 01:46:15.412]  Oh, man.
[01:46:15.432 --> 01:46:16.553]  Well, and so this is the thing.
[01:46:16.593 --> 01:46:21.656]  It's like, so now he's going to have a few more delegates, and how many delegates does
[01:46:22.884 --> 01:46:24.104]  Let me look at this delegate count.
[01:46:24.964 --> 01:46:27.345]  I mean, is this really going to matter if he gets 15 delegates?
[01:46:27.365 --> 01:46:28.105]  No, it's not going to matter.
[01:46:28.125 --> 01:46:38.127]  He's not going to close the... No, he needed in the mid-80s, you know, he needed to get, before this election, he needed to get between 85 and 90 percent of all the remaining delegates.
[01:46:38.207 --> 01:46:40.287]  It's nearly mathematically impossible.
[01:46:40.867 --> 01:46:50.489]  So all he is doing is trying to throw this into a brokered convention, which the GOP establishment is going to cut his throat as well, let him bleed out on the floor.
[01:46:50.509 --> 01:46:52.189]  It's not just going to be Donald Trump.
[01:46:52.973 --> 01:46:58.117]  As one of the GOP consultants said, it'll be Trump bleeding out on the floor after the third round.
[01:46:58.137 --> 01:47:00.439]  Well, it's also going to be Ted Cruz.
[01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:05.283]  I thought it was interesting the way that consultant phrased it.
[01:47:05.303 --> 01:47:08.326]  He said, so then we're left with Miss Congeniality, Ted Cruz.
[01:47:09.377 --> 01:47:12.660]  Which nobody believes he's congenial at all in Senate.
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:13.721]  Or Miss Ohio.
[01:47:13.761 --> 01:47:15.402]  But we could have Miss America.
[01:47:15.442 --> 01:47:17.304]  We could have Paul Ryan from, guess where?
[01:47:17.784 --> 01:47:18.565]  Wisconsin.
[01:47:19.386 --> 01:47:21.567]  Oh, so doesn't that work out nicely for him?
[01:47:21.608 --> 01:47:28.934]  The guy who has absolutely no aspirations for President, just as he had no aspirations for President four years ago when he ran as Vice President.
[01:47:29.134 --> 01:47:31.836]  And he had no aspirations for Speaker of the House.
[01:47:31.956 --> 01:47:33.318]  Over and over again he declined.
[01:47:33.338 --> 01:47:35.319]  But then he accepted finally.
[01:47:35.339 --> 01:47:35.399]  Yes.
[01:47:37.401 --> 01:47:40.225]  Much begging and, oh, I've got to do it for the party.
[01:47:40.245 --> 01:47:41.467]  I must.
[01:47:41.927 --> 01:47:42.168]  Yeah.
[01:47:43.009 --> 01:47:46.774]  Well, so Donald Trump's got 736 as far as delegates.
[01:47:46.814 --> 01:47:47.535]  Ted Cruz has 493.
[01:47:47.575 --> 01:47:48.035]  John Kasich has 143.
[01:47:52.841 --> 01:47:57.304]  You know, but they're still holding out that he might have this big surprise.
[01:47:57.664 --> 01:48:08.092]  I mean, are they really going to just parachute in some special candidate and say, here you go, GOP, this is who you... I mean, how are they going to do this?
[01:48:08.872 --> 01:48:12.715]  How are they going to let people know who their presidential candidate is going to be?
[01:48:12.855 --> 01:48:17.719]  I think they will carefully manage the... well, look, people are bound on the first
[01:48:18.539 --> 01:48:19.300]  On the first ballot.
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:22.765]  But if he doesn't have the 1237, then they're going to go to a second ballot.
[01:48:22.805 --> 01:48:25.889]  At that point, some of the delegates are allowed to vote for whoever they wish.
[01:48:25.909 --> 01:48:29.153]  That's why Ted Cruz is going around and getting delegates who are friendly to him.
[01:48:29.213 --> 01:48:31.516]  On the third ballot, I believe everybody is released.
[01:48:31.556 --> 01:48:36.682]  At that point, the system can play some games and they can let it go for several more rounds.
[01:48:37.883 --> 01:48:43.428]  And after that point, they can put out a thing saying, we're just hopelessly deadlocked and there's just not anything we can do.
[01:48:43.509 --> 01:48:44.309]  I don't know what to do.
[01:48:44.710 --> 01:48:51.896]  We've had 19 rounds that we've gone with these delegates and they just keep shuffling them around and we can't get a clear majority with anybody.
[01:48:51.916 --> 01:48:56.620]  I think the only way we're going to be able to do this is with a fresh face, as Karlo says.
[01:48:56.921 --> 01:49:00.264]  And that's when they'll bring in somebody who never even participated in the primaries.
[01:49:00.584 --> 01:49:02.445]  And regardless of what Paul Ryan is saying,
[01:49:03.166 --> 01:49:03.869]  He will accept it.
[01:49:04.591 --> 01:49:08.383]  Any of these guys will accept it because these guys are all about power.
[01:49:08.463 --> 01:49:08.885]  Power.
[01:49:09.045 --> 01:49:09.206]  Yeah.
[01:49:10.012 --> 01:49:15.296]  They're politicians, they're about power, and that's the way this thing is likely to shake out.
[01:49:15.336 --> 01:49:16.396]  But it's still not over yet.
[01:49:17.057 --> 01:49:19.798]  It is still possible for Donald Trump to get in.
[01:49:19.838 --> 01:49:25.002]  He still only needs, in the mid-50s, he only needs to get in the mid-50s of all the remaining delegates.
[01:49:25.022 --> 01:49:26.623]  There's a lot of states coming up that are friendly.
[01:49:26.903 --> 01:49:30.025]  A lot of states, more than 60% of them are winner-take-all.
[01:49:30.465 --> 01:49:32.747]  So he is not out of the running whatsoever.
[01:49:32.767 --> 01:49:34.248]  Here's a Fox News exit poll.
[01:49:35.128 --> 01:49:35.849]  Look at these numbers.
[01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:40.405]  40 29 27.
[01:49:39.223 --> 01:49:40.405]  Crews in third place.
[01:49:40.425 --> 01:49:40.485]  Hmm.
[01:49:41.587 --> 01:49:42.688]  How does that happen?
[01:49:43.149 --> 01:49:45.592]  It's a Fox News.
[01:49:45.692 --> 01:49:47.815]  What time of day?
[01:49:48.356 --> 01:49:49.097]  That's with moderate.
[01:49:49.117 --> 01:49:49.718]  That's a moderate.
[01:49:49.758 --> 01:49:50.139]  Scroll down.
[01:49:50.159 --> 01:49:51.080]  Yeah, scroll down.
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:52.863]  What other demographics do they have?
[01:49:54.525 --> 01:49:55.806]  Oh, so that's just mainly moderate.
[01:49:55.906 --> 01:49:59.107]  Yeah, they were saying that independent voters were going toward Trump.
[01:49:59.627 --> 01:49:59.788]  Right.
[01:49:59.968 --> 01:50:02.529]  And the evangelicals were going toward Cruz.
[01:50:03.369 --> 01:50:07.231]  So they're calling it now for Cruz and Sanders in Wisconsin.
[01:50:07.251 --> 01:50:09.612]  Okay, I think we've got an answer.
[01:50:09.812 --> 01:50:12.374]  And magically, Ted Cruz has got a
[01:50:13.696 --> 01:50:16.699]  Oh, he's got a 22-point lead.
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:18.100]  That's pretty cool.
[01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:23.525]  You can get a 10-to-1 jump in your lead there overnight.
[01:50:23.705 --> 01:50:36.717]  He's got 24 delegates, and so I guess they're... I guess we need to stop calling these scientific polls, because when you've got six or seven polling organizations, and they're all getting pretty close to the same result, you had one outlier there that said that
[01:50:37.438 --> 01:50:40.800]  Trump was up by 10, but the rest of them were pretty close to each other.
[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:52.447]  And when they can go through and do this, I have to say that these polls don't mean a thing, because as Joseph Stalin said, it isn't who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes.
[01:50:52.867 --> 01:50:55.668]  And we know who counts the votes in the Wisconsin GOP.
[01:50:55.728 --> 01:50:58.010]  As Reince Priebus said, it's our party.
[01:50:59.591 --> 01:51:01.092]  They're trying to join us.
[01:51:01.272 --> 01:51:10.620]  Well, and if they don't mind if Hillary Clinton wins because she's going to be able to help their globalist agenda, then why not just let Donald Trump go?
[01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:19.667]  If they truly think that he's not going to be able to beat Hillary, then... Well, what it costs them is it's going to badly damage the GOP party.
[01:51:19.807 --> 01:51:23.188]  But they don't care because they're in it for themselves.
[01:51:23.208 --> 01:51:24.289]  They're not in it for America.
[01:51:24.309 --> 01:51:27.050]  They're not in it even for their own little political party.
[01:51:27.450 --> 01:51:30.911]  They will find a way to come out of this smelling like a rose.
[01:51:30.951 --> 01:51:33.272]  They'll get a job at a K Street lobbyist or whatever.
[01:51:33.832 --> 01:51:40.255]  But I think it'll be great if they pull these kind of shenanigans, stuff in the ballots,
[01:51:41.135 --> 01:51:51.882]  Creating a brokered convention and giving it away, taking it from the person who has hundreds of delegates in the lead and just basically throwing out the ballots of millions of people.
[01:51:52.442 --> 01:51:55.144]  I think Donald Trump could and should
[01:51:55.836 --> 01:51:56.096]  I agree.
[01:51:56.116 --> 01:51:56.337]  I agree.
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:21.184]  Donald Trump has the personality and the following to really make it happen.
[01:52:21.604 --> 01:52:23.606]  As I said, all he's got is a bunch of votes.
[01:52:24.507 --> 01:52:32.635]  Actually, he's got a lot of people who follow him, and a lot of people could set up a new party that is concerned about putting America first.
[01:52:32.655 --> 01:52:37.479]  Whether it's foreign policy, whether it's trade policy, economic policy, we need to start putting America first.
[01:52:37.539 --> 01:52:39.881]  It's what the Republican Party used to stand for.
[01:52:40.882 --> 01:52:42.902]  Before these globalists took it over.
[01:52:43.262 --> 01:52:47.403]  And they haven't had somebody doing that since the party, since Taft was taking the party in the mid-century.
[01:52:47.423 --> 01:52:52.864]  Right, and the media is really pushing this of, oh no, he's revived nationalism, what a terrible thing.
[01:52:53.204 --> 01:53:02.486]  Because they have been doing such a good job at pushing the globalist agenda, and we're a global community, and your kids belong to the community and not to their parents.
[01:53:02.846 --> 01:53:09.327]  And now all of a sudden, people are starting to say, well wait a minute, this is, we need to take care of ourselves and our own country.
[01:53:09.867 --> 01:53:10.207]  That's right.
[01:53:10.227 --> 01:53:12.068]  Put the mask on our own face first.
[01:53:28.576 --> 01:53:34.318]  To have an entire magazine, unprecedented, an entire magazine dedicated to stopping Trump.
[01:53:34.338 --> 01:53:35.459]  Of course, it was National Review.
[01:53:35.959 --> 01:53:49.725]  They are the mouthpiece for the Wall Street globalists, the forever war neocons, and it has never been more obvious how the lines are drawn within the Republican Party and how these people have taken over the Republican Party.
[01:53:49.805 --> 01:53:50.845]  It's never been more obvious.
[01:53:51.125 --> 01:53:51.686]  We need to
[01:53:52.446 --> 01:53:58.548]  Either if we can't get rid of them, we need to just leave them and transcend them and start a new third party.
[01:53:59.209 --> 01:54:00.109]  And I'm all for that.
[01:54:00.409 --> 01:54:01.630]  I am all for that.
[01:54:01.730 --> 01:54:09.433]  I hope that Trump doesn't, you know, take one to the chin and say, oh, well, okay, I didn't, you guys got me this time with the convention.
[01:54:09.793 --> 01:54:18.296]  I hope that, I mean, he's been so outspoken and so anti-establishment and kind of a baby, you know, I hope he does say, you know what?
[01:54:18.316 --> 01:54:19.016]  Screw you guys.
[01:54:19.076 --> 01:54:20.057]  I'm going to run third party.
[01:54:21.337 --> 01:54:21.897]  Fantastic.
[01:54:21.957 --> 01:54:30.202]  Well you know the interesting thing is we had the Reform Party come out of Ross Perot and I think that Donald Trump is a lot more specific about a lot more policies.
[01:54:30.262 --> 01:54:34.884]  It's not just the trade and the immigration but it's also things like health care.
[01:54:35.304 --> 01:54:42.027]  We've had the GOP establishment lie to our faces election after election saying they're going to get rid of Obamacare and the mandate.
[01:54:42.468 --> 01:54:44.289]  They've never had a plan.
[01:54:44.489 --> 01:54:48.931]  They've never told us what they're going to do or how they're going to get rid of it and they've never even tried.
[01:54:48.971 --> 01:54:50.712]  They get elected and then immediately they've
[01:54:51.272 --> 01:54:51.772]  I think so.
[01:55:15.382 --> 01:55:16.283]  Health care issues.
[01:55:16.623 --> 01:55:32.616]  He's got a detailed seven point plan that takes away the mandate, gives us incentive, gives us ownership, gives us a way to, gives us a competitive marketplace, gives us a way to see what the prices are that the different health care providers are offering.
[01:55:33.016 --> 01:55:38.080]  He's got every good thing there that has been proposed by independent think tanks.
[01:55:38.180 --> 01:55:39.321]  It's a very detailed policy.
[01:55:39.341 --> 01:55:40.262]  If you go and look at Ted Cruz.
[01:55:40.282 --> 01:55:41.323]  But they keep saying he has no plan.
[01:55:41.343 --> 01:55:42.144]  He has no plan.
[01:55:42.204 --> 01:55:44.806]  And it's like, no, he is releasing them and they're good.
[01:55:45.146 --> 01:55:54.731]  And if you look at Ted Cruz, what we get from Ted Cruz is the typical boilerplate GOP rhetoric that we've been getting throughout the last several decades.
[01:55:55.112 --> 01:55:57.293]  I'm going to repeal Obamacare.
[01:55:57.573 --> 01:55:58.133]  End of story.
[01:55:58.173 --> 01:56:00.835]  He doesn't offer a plan, he doesn't tell us how he's going to repeal it.
[01:56:01.155 --> 01:56:06.579]  He doesn't offer something in its place that is better than what we had without Obamacare.
[01:56:06.919 --> 01:56:08.040]  And that's what Donald Trump does.
[01:56:08.060 --> 01:56:16.766]  He offers a detailed plan that is far better than the healthcare system that we had before Obamacare because it is based on ownership and free market and competition and choice.
[01:56:17.406 --> 01:56:18.166]  And incentives.
[01:56:18.826 --> 01:56:22.127]  That's what he offers, and yet Ted Cruz doesn't offer any of that.
[01:56:22.187 --> 01:56:25.088]  He just says, well, I'm going to get rid of Obamacare because I know that's what you want to hear.
[01:56:25.288 --> 01:56:28.468]  He does all this data mining and tells people precisely what they want to hear.
[01:56:28.708 --> 01:56:30.829]  He is a dangerous, dangerous person.
[01:56:31.169 --> 01:56:31.369]  Right.
[01:56:31.889 --> 01:56:38.451]  And just imagine if the Republicans would have fought this hard, as hard as they're fighting to take out Donald Trump.
[01:56:38.511 --> 01:56:44.012]  Imagine if they would have fought that hard to stop some of the Obama's agenda or whatever.
[01:56:44.112 --> 01:56:44.472]  Oh, yeah.
[01:56:45.472 --> 01:56:45.712]  Good point.
[01:56:45.732 --> 01:56:46.053]  Good point.
[01:57:12.176 --> 01:57:19.186]  And truly this is one for the record books when we see that Ted Cruz explodes in a 20 point jump in the polls overnight.
[01:57:19.607 --> 01:57:20.548]  You haven't seen this before.
[01:57:21.328 --> 01:57:22.708]  Nothing to worry about, folks.
[01:57:22.788 --> 01:57:23.849]  It's really genuine.
[01:57:24.329 --> 01:57:25.669]  I believe this is genuine, yeah.
[01:57:25.829 --> 01:57:27.890]  Yeah, no, he's a lovable, likable guy.
[01:57:28.050 --> 01:57:29.870]  And I got a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn, too.
[01:57:29.890 --> 01:57:30.730]  Okay.
[01:57:31.110 --> 01:57:31.590]  All right, guys.
[01:57:31.610 --> 01:57:34.971]  Well, tune in to the Alex Jones Show tomorrow at 11 p.m.
[01:57:35.031 --> 01:57:35.391]  Central.
[01:57:35.451 --> 01:57:39.152]  And of course, we'll be here again with the InfoWars Nightly News at 7 p.m.
[01:57:39.192 --> 01:57:40.193]  That's 11 a.m.
[01:57:40.593 --> 01:57:40.953]  11 a.m.
[01:57:41.553 --> 01:57:42.793]  You know, 11 a.m.
[01:57:42.833 --> 01:57:43.193]  Central.
[01:57:43.533 --> 01:57:45.234]  We'll see you here 7 p.m.
[01:57:45.594 --> 01:57:46.114]  tomorrow night.
[01:58:35.447 --> 01:58:44.657]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important area of InfoWars that runs the whole operation that is having such a big effect against the globalists.
[01:58:45.457 --> 01:58:53.045]  And I've said it over and over again, it is you the listeners and the viewers that send us the intel, the news tips, that support the broadcast, that spread the word.
[01:58:53.986 --> 01:58:57.088]  You are 90% of the operation or more.
[01:58:57.128 --> 01:58:58.329]  You don't stand beside us.
[01:58:58.369 --> 01:59:00.290]  You stand at the heart of InfoWars.
[01:59:00.670 --> 01:59:11.696]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[01:59:12.296 --> 01:59:17.638]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[01:59:18.058 --> 01:59:23.320]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:29.982]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLife.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.
[01:59:30.422 --> 01:59:38.745]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when products are sold out, you're unable to get them, sometimes for months, but we hold back the products for people that have already signed up for AutoShip.
[01:59:39.392 --> 01:59:50.500]  When you choose AutoShip before checkout on your order at Infowarshore.com, we'll give you 10% off and give you guaranteed delivery of out-of-stock products that are on your AutoShip list.
[01:59:51.020 --> 01:59:54.302]  Plus, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:59:54.922 --> 02:00:01.547]  Listers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products when you need them each month.
[02:00:02.572 --> 02:00:03.593]  Now it's finally here.
[02:00:04.054 --> 02:00:07.558]  AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:00:07.878 --> 02:00:08.359]  It's easy.

[02:00:16.031 --> 02:00:22.792]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, it's a sure win.
[02:00:22.952 --> 02:00:26.533]  You add to that free shipping on orders above $50, it is a can't lose.

[02:00:46.758 --> 02:00:56.300]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[02:00:56.780 --> 02:00:58.500]  It's the illusion of choice.
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:00:59.241]  Think about it.
[02:00:59.441 --> 02:01:05.262]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[02:01:05.482 --> 02:01:11.043]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[02:01:11.443 --> 02:01:23.207]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[02:01:23.467 --> 02:01:26.247]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[02:01:26.428 --> 02:01:28.888]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[02:01:29.208 --> 02:01:33.670]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[02:01:34.110 --> 02:01:34.650]  Think about it.
[02:01:34.890 --> 02:01:46.065]  This is Darren McBreen and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and listen to the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on in your mind.
[02:01:55.698 --> 02:01:59.626]  You are watching the InfoWars Nightly News, which airs 7 p.m.
[02:01:59.686 --> 02:02:02.151]  Central at InfoWarsNews.com.
[02:02:02.251 --> 02:02:04.976]  And your support is helping us defend liberty worldwide.
