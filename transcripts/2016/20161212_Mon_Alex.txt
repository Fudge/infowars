[00:00:02.968 --> 00:00:03.714]  I'm on rail with Chevy.
[00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:42.572]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[00:00:42.572 --> 00:00:44.353]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.353 --> 00:00:47.516]  You want it, baby?
[00:00:47.516 --> 00:00:47.917]  You're up!
[00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:34.426]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lives and disinformation.
[00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:37.448]  It's Monday, the 12th day of December, 2016.
[00:01:37.448 --> 00:01:46.734]  And I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:46.734 --> 00:01:54.160]  About 30 seconds before I went on air, we have different monitors on with Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, C-SPAN.
[00:01:56.735 --> 00:02:00.438]  We have TVs in the hallways, TVs in the bright room, TVs in the control room.
[00:02:00.438 --> 00:02:03.040]  We're just monitoring things.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.523]  Plus, screens up everywhere, tracking the latest news developments, going through your news tips.
[00:02:07.523 --> 00:02:13.047]  And I was sitting there looking at CNN on the screen and it said, Trump battles CIA.
[00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.431]  And then it cut to, Trump is with Putin!
[00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:37.021]  And I'm just reading the big text, the white text on a red background at the bottom of the screen, and it's so surreal that you have a president that's just trying to restore our republic, get fair trade deals, defend the Second Amendment, appoint
[00:02:38.487 --> 00:02:49.094]  Americana judges in the Supreme Court, and you've got Hollywood and mainstream media only getting more shrill, more hysterical, more wild-eyed, more crazy.
[00:02:49.094 --> 00:03:03.925]  Now, it's coming out very, very quickly that the entire election was manipulated by the Russians' narrative is a huge, gargantuan, colossal hoax.
[00:03:05.578 --> 00:03:07.880]  We have the evidence of that today, we're going to be going over.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:26.476]  But we've already been hearing this for over a year, that Russia's manipulating our election, despite the fact that even Mika Brzezinski has come out and said that if they mildly criticized Hillary, they would get threatened with their jobs by the Clinton campaign through their bosses at NBC.
[00:03:26.476 --> 00:03:28.318]  But we already know that from the WikiLeaks.
[00:03:28.318 --> 00:03:30.360]  Glenn Greenwald had an article out yesterday where
[00:03:32.521 --> 00:03:41.587]  Millions of Hillary were just producing completely fake news, giving it to MSNBC and they were running with it when they knew it was a lie!
[00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:43.769]  DrugsReport.com has a story up.
[00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:59.260]  The latest reporter that just got hired at a senior position at the New York Times has come out and is now being hired there and it turns out in the WikiLeaks, this is a person that got directives from the Hillary campaign.
[00:04:00.225 --> 00:04:04.347]  So even after they're caught, they're doing this.
[00:04:04.347 --> 00:04:15.692]  But when I say it's fake, to claim there's this Russian connection, we have all the multinationals and the globalists and the big foundations and the CIA involved in our elections, all of it's supposed to be illegal.
[00:04:19.127 --> 00:04:29.364]  We now have former UK ambassador saying, quote, I met with the DNC leaker and he isn't Russian, saying the CIA information is, quote, total BS.
[00:04:29.364 --> 00:04:30.586]  That's the London Guardian today.
[00:04:30.586 --> 00:04:31.628]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:04:33.618 --> 00:04:34.399]  We have former U.S.
[00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:46.227]  Ambassador to the U.N., John Bolton, coming out and saying that he believes it's a Obama false flag and that if there is any intel, it was planted by them recently during the campaign.
[00:04:46.227 --> 00:04:50.290]  Yeah, that makes absolute perfect sense, doesn't it?
[00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.812]  All this and a lot more, but here's the bottom line.
[00:04:52.812 --> 00:04:57.435]  They're trying to overthrow the election of the 45th President of the United States.
[00:04:57.435 --> 00:04:58.676]  They now admit they're doing it.
[00:05:01.048 --> 00:05:14.957]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[00:05:14.957 --> 00:05:19.240]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.802]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve?
[00:05:21.802 --> 00:05:24.384]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[00:05:24.384 --> 00:05:30.648]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[00:05:31.128 --> 00:05:35.852]  What kind of leverage do these people in the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[00:05:35.852 --> 00:05:40.195]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[00:05:40.195 --> 00:05:42.657]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[00:05:42.657 --> 00:05:47.661]  Adams also said, liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.
[00:05:47.661 --> 00:05:49.002]  Join the InfoWars.
[00:05:49.002 --> 00:05:50.303]  Spread the information.
[00:05:50.303 --> 00:05:52.284]  Educate yourself and others.
[00:05:52.284 --> 00:05:53.965]  The truth shall set you free.
[00:05:53.965 --> 00:05:55.867]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:05:59.528 --> 00:06:03.551]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[00:06:03.551 --> 00:06:04.672]  Charlie Daniels.
[00:06:04.672 --> 00:06:06.533]  He's always loved America.
[00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.335]  He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[00:06:08.335 --> 00:06:11.197]  Let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21.
[00:06:11.197 --> 00:06:15.220]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.641]  Individual rights.
[00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:19.343]  We'll have to take a back seat to the collective.
[00:06:19.343 --> 00:06:20.884]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[00:06:21.264 --> 00:06:22.826]  It's gonna be coming after you, Gunn.
[00:06:22.826 --> 00:06:23.266]  Oh, yeah!
[00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:25.769]  I tell you, it ain't gonna set well down my way.
[00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:26.750]  At all.
[00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.791]  It ain't gonna set well.
[00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:29.933]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[00:06:29.933 --> 00:06:31.174]  It's time to ride, boys.
[00:06:31.174 --> 00:06:33.136]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[00:06:33.136 --> 00:06:39.223]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[00:06:39.223 --> 00:06:41.105]  And beef was for supper.
[00:06:41.785 --> 00:06:44.407]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[00:06:44.407 --> 00:06:46.128]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[00:06:46.128 --> 00:06:47.789]  DVDs now available.
[00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:52.491]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:55.853]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[00:06:55.853 --> 00:06:58.194]  Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[00:06:58.194 --> 00:06:59.635]  Let's fix it.
[00:06:59.635 --> 00:07:04.378]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.
[00:07:04.378 --> 00:07:08.160]  It's time to start assisting the body in regulating proper prostate balance.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:20.027]  InfoWars Life has set out to bring you formulations that are not only the highest quality out there, but formulas that you can use on a daily basis to give your body the natural herbs and extracts that our experts recommend.
[00:07:20.027 --> 00:07:27.991]  The Prostagard formula does just that with its mixture of plant-based nutrients and antioxidants that help give your body total support.
[00:07:27.991 --> 00:07:32.914]  It's a hand-selected blend of saw palmetto, lycopene, plant sterols,
[00:07:33.434 --> 00:07:34.315]  We're good.
[00:08:07.846 --> 00:08:07.926]  38.
[00:08:07.926 --> 00:08:10.968]  It's Monday, December 12, 2016.
[00:08:10.968 --> 00:08:19.794]  We are now only 38 days out from the historic inauguration of Donald J. Trump to be our 45th president.
[00:08:19.794 --> 00:08:25.999]  But as we speak, the forces of globalism are openly trying to overturn his election.
[00:08:25.999 --> 00:08:32.523]  And under the directives of Obama, the Central Intelligence Agency has reared its ugly head.
[00:08:32.523 --> 00:08:34.685]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:56.024]  20 or more articles I've seen just in the last few hours have been published by mainstream newspapers calling for a new election.
[00:08:56.024 --> 00:09:07.748]  It all started Friday and Saturday with CNN and MSNBC and others having CIA operatives like Robert Bear on
[00:09:09.733 --> 00:09:18.555]  Saying that, oh, the evidence is clear, Russia stole the election for Trump, and so we've got to have a new election.
[00:09:18.555 --> 00:09:28.896]  Such a joke coming from the agency that is trained to lie, and who's not supposed to be involved under federal law in domestic operations.
[00:09:28.896 --> 00:09:38.938]  But you see, three years ago, Congress, in the National Defense Authorization Act, bipartisanly, changed the law to let the CIA engage in disinformation domestically.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.883]  Now they've been caught doing it many times since it was founded in 1947.
[00:09:42.883 --> 00:09:48.008]  And there were congressional hearings on it in the 70s, obviously.
[00:09:48.008 --> 00:09:51.251]  But now they are going to the next level.
[00:09:51.251 --> 00:09:55.555]  And we've got CNN saying it's a national emergency that Trump's in.
[00:09:55.555 --> 00:09:57.276]  He's got to be removed.
[00:09:57.276 --> 00:09:59.799]  He's a Russian agent.
[00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.020]  That's the latest this morning.
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:01.841]  I have a clip of that.
[00:10:03.581 --> 00:10:04.601]  They mean business.
[00:10:04.601 --> 00:10:07.243]  These are the people that have hijacked this country.
[00:10:07.243 --> 00:10:09.824]  They're the globalists, they work for the multinationals.
[00:10:09.824 --> 00:10:14.746]  And so whatever they're doing, they turn around and throw it in our face.
[00:10:14.746 --> 00:10:22.610]  It wasn't angry Americans of every race, color, and creed that were upset about globalism, who were upset about our jobs being shipped overseas.
[00:10:27.421 --> 00:10:29.042]  That's not why you voted for Trump.
[00:10:29.042 --> 00:10:34.144]  You voted for Trump because the Russians mind-controlled you.
[00:10:34.144 --> 00:10:35.965]  Russia can barely run its own country.
[00:10:35.965 --> 00:10:42.347]  It's got an economy the size of Italy, though it has three times their population.
[00:10:42.347 --> 00:10:44.348]  They're on the verge of collapsing.
[00:10:44.348 --> 00:10:51.031]  George Soros admits he's got operatives inside the country fomenting what they call color revolutions.
[00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:52.371]  They have two military bases.
[00:10:52.371 --> 00:10:53.232]  We have thousands.
[00:10:56.297 --> 00:11:03.742]  China is openly taking over our major infrastructure, Hollywood, the newspapers.
[00:11:03.742 --> 00:11:07.024]  That's the newspapers that Carlos Slim hasn't bought up, the Mexican Kingpin.
[00:11:07.024 --> 00:11:14.708]  But we're told it's Russia, the perfect little boogeyman.
[00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:17.950]  China's richest man warns Trump of risk to U.S.
[00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:18.411]  jobs.
[00:11:19.332 --> 00:11:38.518]  Yes, we have the Chinese Communist leaders on television telling us about how we should live when they're total hypocrites living in opulence worth hundreds of billions of dollars in some cases like that individual who is the man buying up the big six Hollywood production studios.
[00:11:38.518 --> 00:11:43.399]  He's buying a controlling interest in them.
[00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:46.160]  Oh, there's no talk of antitrust there though.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.221]  Forget antitrust, what about national security?
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:12:00.589]  And then we have these traitors of the CIA that clearly killed Kennedy, that have clearly been involved domestically, shipping narcotics into the country.
[00:12:00.589 --> 00:12:06.173]  It's amazing.
[00:12:06.173 --> 00:12:15.701]  So, as a culture, we have to realize that we have an alien globalist force that is hell-bent on destroying the American system that's now seized control of this country.
[00:12:17.188 --> 00:12:42.212]  And they are arrogant enough, they're full of themselves enough that they are openly now pushing the case that electors should not go for Trump on December 19th, only seven days away, and that Hillary Rodham Clinton should be given, via the Electoral College, the 45th President's position.
[00:12:43.735 --> 00:12:45.917]  Now everybody knows Trump will fight that, won't he?
[00:12:45.917 --> 00:12:48.639]  Well, not if he's dead.
[00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:55.404]  And they wouldn't be on the news, and they wouldn't have the CIA out there running around, and they wouldn't have congressmen calling for an overthrow of this election.
[00:12:55.404 --> 00:13:02.769]  And Black Lives Matter wouldn't have had its money doubled by Soros the last few months if they weren't planning civil unrest and a national emergency.
[00:13:02.769 --> 00:13:05.791]  And civil war.
[00:13:05.791 --> 00:13:11.636]  So you can look at the tea leaves and try to decide for yourself what you think they're about to pull, but here's the prime analysis.
[00:13:12.762 --> 00:13:15.044]  Here's the threat vector.
[00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:19.868]  They're moving to overthrow this counter-coup we've launched.
[00:13:19.868 --> 00:13:23.631]  We've launched this counter-coup against the globalists.
[00:13:23.631 --> 00:13:29.756]  And they're trying to block us at every front, whether Trump's perfect, whether Trump's a mixed bag.
[00:13:29.756 --> 00:13:32.738]  Bottom line, they know he wants prosperity.
[00:13:32.738 --> 00:13:34.179]  They know he wants growth.
[00:13:34.179 --> 00:13:35.440]  And they don't want growth.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.761]  They want consolidation.
[00:13:36.761 --> 00:13:37.462]  And that's his sin.
[00:13:41.072 --> 00:13:46.436]  And he doesn't have a score to settle with America.
[00:13:46.436 --> 00:13:49.499]  He's not out to get the country.
[00:13:49.499 --> 00:14:00.147]  Now I talk about civil unrest, I talk about civil war, I talk about civil emergency, national emergency, CNN now has multiple hosts and so does MSNBC.
[00:14:00.147 --> 00:14:02.549]  I've been hearing this all weekend.
[00:14:02.549 --> 00:14:09.475]  I was so concerned, I worked most of the weekend and followed a lot of special reports as many of you know, coming out and saying that
[00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:18.744]  Trump is destabilizing the country, creating a quote, national emergency, quote, the ultimate goal of the Russian disinformation to undermine democracy.
[00:14:18.744 --> 00:14:22.607]  That means undermining the criminals that have hijacked the country and the fake media.
[00:14:22.607 --> 00:14:29.691]  He says the ultimate goal of Russian disinformation to undermine democracy, to undermine faith in our institutions like the media.
[00:14:29.691 --> 00:14:34.975]  Wall told Staedtler, we have a president-elect now who has basically
[00:14:37.029 --> 00:14:42.872]  Match some of these key talking points in Russian propaganda to undermine our system.
[00:14:42.872 --> 00:14:47.495]  That's CNN's Stettler, so-called media analyst.
[00:14:47.495 --> 00:14:53.118]  So get this, if you're Brexit and you don't want to be under EU control and massive taxes, you must be a Ruski agent.
[00:14:53.118 --> 00:15:00.522]  If you don't want to turn your guns in, and don't believe the state owns your kids, and want to control our borders, and don't like Obamacare, you're a Ruski agent.
[00:15:01.698 --> 00:15:03.360]  You're no longer a conspiracy theorist.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.901]  You're no longer a racist.
[00:15:04.901 --> 00:15:05.842]  That didn't work.
[00:15:05.842 --> 00:15:09.525]  Now you're a Russian agent.
[00:15:09.525 --> 00:15:11.888]  And Trump's a Russian agent.
[00:15:11.888 --> 00:15:18.554]  In between his part-time job as Santa Claus and his other part-time job as a Loch Ness Monster or a UFO pilot.
[00:15:18.554 --> 00:15:20.636]  I mean, this is that insane.
[00:15:23.328 --> 00:15:29.071]  Meanwhile, it's been telegraphed by William Benny and now British ambassadors and others that it was the U.S.
[00:15:29.071 --> 00:15:31.392]  intelligence agencies that leaked the information.
[00:15:31.392 --> 00:15:34.794]  And I already know that because I was leaked information about the Secret Service.
[00:15:34.794 --> 00:15:38.436]  That she was falling down.
[00:15:38.436 --> 00:15:39.797]  She was having seizures all the time.
[00:15:39.797 --> 00:15:42.418]  And we caught her twice having seizures.
[00:15:42.418 --> 00:15:45.000]  Millie Weaver caught her having to go in a tent for 45 minutes.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.481]  They had emergency crews in there.
[00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:51.143]  Then we saw her fall down in front of everybody a few days later in New York.
[00:15:51.143 --> 00:15:52.564]  And we saw her black ambulance.
[00:15:53.632 --> 00:15:55.653]  The Secret Service told us to look for.
[00:15:55.653 --> 00:15:59.234]  She's in bad shape, folks.
[00:15:59.234 --> 00:16:00.574]  You saw it happen.
[00:16:00.574 --> 00:16:02.154]  We have our own sources.
[00:16:02.154 --> 00:16:03.575]  They didn't come from the Russians.
[00:16:03.575 --> 00:16:04.015]  D.C.
[00:16:04.015 --> 00:16:05.635]  leaks didn't come from the Russians.
[00:16:05.635 --> 00:16:07.756]  It came from inside the DNC.
[00:16:07.756 --> 00:16:13.338]  People that were horrified by Bernie Sanders having the election stolen from him.
[00:16:13.338 --> 00:16:13.958]  And now you've...
[00:16:15.382 --> 00:16:17.343]  Failed at overturning the country.
[00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:20.704]  You've lost control, at least of a critical beachhead.
[00:16:20.704 --> 00:16:22.985]  And they're in total panic mode right now.
[00:16:22.985 --> 00:16:25.006]  Look at these headlines.
[00:16:25.006 --> 00:16:28.207]  Congressman begs electoral college voters to block Trump.
[00:16:31.147 --> 00:16:39.896]  Especially as the recounts all over the country are showing hundreds of thousands of votes for Trump that hadn't been given to him, stolen by the Hillary people in every state.
[00:16:39.896 --> 00:16:40.677]  Isn't that funny?
[00:16:40.677 --> 00:16:41.798]  Just what Trump said.
[00:16:41.798 --> 00:16:49.846]  Millions of votes were taken from him, and if you add up all the states, they've only done a recount in a couple, the numbers add up to more than two million.
[00:16:49.846 --> 00:16:54.711]  Give the average held across the country we're seeing in Michigan and Wisconsin and other states.
[00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:01.152]  Former UK ambassador, I met with DNC leaker and he isn't Russian.
[00:17:01.152 --> 00:17:05.035]  Craig Murray calls BS, that's his quote, on CIA claims.
[00:17:05.035 --> 00:17:07.556]  Paul Joseph Watson, he quotes the London Guardian article.
[00:17:09.713 --> 00:17:11.815]  Actually read to you from the Guardian?
[00:17:11.815 --> 00:17:20.442]  Craig Murray, the former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan, who's a close associate of Assange, called the CIA claims BS, adding, they're absolutely making it up.
[00:17:20.442 --> 00:17:22.003]  I know who leaked them, Murray said.
[00:17:22.003 --> 00:17:27.308]  I've met the person who leaked them, and they are certainly not Russian, and it's an insider.
[00:17:27.308 --> 00:17:28.769]  It's a leak, not a hack.
[00:17:28.769 --> 00:17:34.694]  The two are different things.
[00:17:34.694 --> 00:17:36.035]  Here's another one.
[00:17:36.035 --> 00:17:36.816]  Trump dismisses
[00:17:38.519 --> 00:17:43.201]  Russia's CIA claim says it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:17:43.201 --> 00:17:46.002]  He says it's just another excuse.
[00:17:46.002 --> 00:17:50.123]  Now what's Bolton say, former full head U.S.
[00:17:50.123 --> 00:17:52.624]  ambassador to the U.N.?
[00:17:52.624 --> 00:17:55.565]  Bolton calls Russian hack a false flag.
[00:17:55.565 --> 00:17:58.286]  He says it may be a Obama false flag.
[00:17:58.286 --> 00:17:58.926]  Former U.N.
[00:17:58.926 --> 00:18:02.908]  ambassador believes intelligence has been politicized in Obama administration.
[00:18:05.802 --> 00:18:08.506]  That is the pot calling the kettle black, I gotta tell you about Bolton.
[00:18:08.506 --> 00:18:15.355]  It's really weird to hear Bolton and Primus and people saying things I totally agree with when I don't particularly like them.
[00:18:16.414 --> 00:18:17.034]  Let's continue.
[00:18:17.034 --> 00:18:18.255]  Democratic Congressman.
[00:18:18.255 --> 00:18:22.358]  Again, electors should consider foreign interference reports before casting votes.
[00:18:22.358 --> 00:18:28.022]  See, this is all meant to push the idea to give cover to delegates who are being bribed, intimidated, threatened.
[00:18:28.022 --> 00:18:31.084]  You know what mafias do to juries and grand juries.
[00:18:31.084 --> 00:18:34.446]  Imagine what the global mafia is doing right now to those electors.
[00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:36.528]  To just announce, oh, we have more evidence.
[00:18:36.528 --> 00:18:37.689]  Trump's a Russian agent.
[00:18:37.689 --> 00:18:41.511]  Oh, Trump had a heart attack today or Trump's plane blew up.
[00:18:41.511 --> 00:18:42.732]  Don't be a conspiracy terrorist.
[00:18:42.732 --> 00:18:43.693]  We don't know why it blew up.
[00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:47.565]  Then they'll bust some patriot person and say they did it or something.
[00:18:47.565 --> 00:18:49.727]  I mean, sky's the limit.
[00:18:59.591 --> 00:19:11.744]  Meanwhile, when we come back, Senate quietly passes the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act that gives hundreds of millions of dollars to, you guessed it, the CIA and the State Department to engage in disinformation.
[00:19:11.744 --> 00:19:18.811]  So now they legalize disinformation, now they're openly setting up an office instead of it being secretly conduited through WikiLeaks.
[00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:21.134]  It's going to be done openly against the American people.
[00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.292]  But here's the big takeaway from all this.
[00:19:25.292 --> 00:19:33.938]  I told everybody, I hate to say I told you so, that they weren't going to give up and they were going to try to take the electors, they were going to have recounts, they're going to try to kill Trump.
[00:19:33.938 --> 00:19:38.722]  They're in every major newspaper saying someone please kill him.
[00:19:38.722 --> 00:19:48.630]  And now they're saying he's a Russian agent to be able to trigger the president, they believe, to be able to authorize a hit team to take out the president-elect before he gets in in 38 days.
[00:19:50.945 --> 00:19:52.909]  That's how hardcore this is.
[00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:54.471]  That's the waters we're in.
[00:19:54.471 --> 00:19:57.236]  I notice folks aren't laughing at me now, are ya?
[00:19:57.236 --> 00:19:58.659]  This is deadly serious.
[00:20:00.208 --> 00:20:04.991]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[00:20:04.991 --> 00:20:10.874]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[00:20:10.874 --> 00:20:17.377]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[00:20:17.377 --> 00:20:21.420]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:00.298]  Reality check.
[00:22:00.298 --> 00:22:01.159]  Rampant hacking.
[00:22:01.159 --> 00:22:01.959]  Identity theft.
[00:22:01.959 --> 00:22:02.819]  Mass surveillance.
[00:22:02.819 --> 00:22:04.840]  Defending yourself today is not an option.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.780]  It's a requirement.

[00:22:58.587 --> 00:23:01.328]  Taking turmeric is good, but there's a problem with it.
[00:23:01.328 --> 00:23:07.230]  The active ingredient in turmeric, known as curcumin, is poorly absorbed into the cells due to its large particle size.

[00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:01.090]  Federal agents!
[00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:06.033]  We are armed!
[00:24:06.033 --> 00:24:09.955]  So we've got a bunch of smiley-faced traitors.
[00:24:09.955 --> 00:24:20.282]  I think it's funny and cute to artificially put this country into a destabilization and to prepare the country for a national emergency in CNN's own words.
[00:24:20.282 --> 00:24:27.106]  Then they sit back and blame Donald Trump and voters for it, claiming we were all under the control of Russians.
[00:24:28.865 --> 00:24:33.029]  This is so over-the-top insulting.
[00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:37.113]  That's right, Catalonia has been trying to leave Spain for 50 years.
[00:24:37.113 --> 00:24:42.739]  They're now saying that they successfully voted this year to begin leaving because of the Russians.
[00:24:42.739 --> 00:24:48.404]  Merkel was in Der Spiegel yesterday, and Bild, and in Reuters.
[00:24:48.404 --> 00:24:49.325]  I saw three articles.
[00:24:50.246 --> 00:24:57.252]  Blaming the Russians for the fact that her party is losing all these different parliamentary elections.
[00:24:57.252 --> 00:25:03.977]  No lady, you're opening the borders up to millions of military-age men that are running around raping and killing.
[00:25:03.977 --> 00:25:07.580]  But see, nothing's ever your fault.
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:13.445]  I was reading the CNN article.
[00:25:13.445 --> 00:25:17.208]  They go on to say our institutions aren't trusted.
[00:25:17.208 --> 00:25:18.349]  We're sacrosanct.
[00:25:19.346 --> 00:25:25.814]  That's like, that's like George Will when he wrote for the Washington Post.
[00:25:25.814 --> 00:25:29.960]  Of course your popular vote doesn't count in the primary.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:34.545]  It is the sovereign party that decides, not a mere plurality of voters.
[00:25:35.919 --> 00:25:38.382]  Translate that into normal speak.
[00:25:38.382 --> 00:25:41.386]  We are royalty and we don't care about the majority of the vote.
[00:25:41.386 --> 00:25:42.728]  That's what that means.
[00:25:42.728 --> 00:25:43.930]  We are sovereign.
[00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.053]  We don't care about plurality of vote.
[00:25:46.053 --> 00:25:49.377]  What North Korean nutball planet are you on?
[00:25:50.205 --> 00:25:54.247]  Look at the smiley face of Stellar on CNN.
[00:25:54.247 --> 00:25:55.548]  I mean, just who would watch that guy?
[00:25:55.548 --> 00:25:57.429]  Who would listen to that nobody?
[00:25:57.429 --> 00:26:00.090]  Just another little twit.
[00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:09.175]  And they all sit there and regurgitate how great they are to each other because they control America and Americans are dumb effers as the WikiLeaks show.
[00:26:09.175 --> 00:26:09.975]  And then you've got this.
[00:26:09.975 --> 00:26:12.276]  It gets even worse.
[00:26:12.276 --> 00:26:15.958]  New York Times hires reporter who sent stories to Clinton staffers for approval.
[00:26:16.698 --> 00:26:22.065]  Glenn Thrush, the one that called Thrush to be censored last week on MSNBC for shutting down his competition?
[00:26:22.065 --> 00:26:25.029]  What an authoritarian!
[00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:29.475]  He's the guy that said, I'll lie, I'm a hack, just tell me what to write!
[00:26:29.475 --> 00:26:33.060]  They're like, oh my god, you're gonna get promoted to the New York Times!
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.202]  You're amazing!
[00:26:35.848 --> 00:26:39.589]  They all sit there with that weird, self-important look on their face.
[00:26:39.589 --> 00:26:42.070]  Like they're sitting in a huge, dirty diaper or something.
[00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:50.374]  I don't know what it is about these weird traitors and these people that prey on Americans and who lie for a living, but they just are all so self-important.
[00:26:50.374 --> 00:26:52.734]  I mean, look at that guy on screen, TV viewers.
[00:26:52.734 --> 00:26:55.816]  Look at what a sack of garbage he is.
[00:26:55.816 --> 00:26:57.696]  And then look at Stellar.
[00:26:57.696 --> 00:27:03.999]  He looks even worse with that fake, confident smile on his face, all leering like he's a crocodile.
[00:27:05.287 --> 00:27:06.768]  I mean, look at that guy!
[00:27:06.768 --> 00:27:08.629]  Look at these nobodies!
[00:27:08.629 --> 00:27:15.232]  All they can do is go get a job with a traitor globalist who can't get anybody real to work for him now because they're so dishonorable.
[00:27:15.232 --> 00:27:17.033]  Look at all of these people.
[00:27:17.033 --> 00:27:18.974]  This is who rules over us?
[00:27:18.974 --> 00:27:21.355]  A bunch of Ivy League nobodies?
[00:27:21.355 --> 00:27:27.098]  A bunch of nerds who've got a score to settle with everybody else?
[00:27:27.098 --> 00:27:27.618]  I'm sorry.
[00:27:30.247 --> 00:27:30.968]  But I'm getting angry.
[00:27:30.968 --> 00:27:33.631]  I've got a bunch of clips I haven't gotten to, and I want to go to them when we come back from break.
[00:27:33.631 --> 00:27:35.493]  But let's start with one now.
[00:27:35.493 --> 00:27:42.141]  This is Bob Bayer, whose job is overthrowing governments, torturing people, lying, killing people, blaming it on other people that didn't do it.
[00:27:42.141 --> 00:27:44.203]  They made the movie Siriana about him.
[00:27:44.203 --> 00:27:45.805]  Big leftist CIA guy.
[00:27:45.805 --> 00:27:47.687]  Remember, the CIA still works for the President.
[00:27:47.687 --> 00:27:48.448]  That's Obama.
[00:27:48.448 --> 00:27:50.411]  They'll do whatever they're told, at least factions of it.
[00:27:51.658 --> 00:27:58.141]  And now, just like they had factions of the CIA put out false reports about WMDs in Iraq, the same thing today.
[00:27:58.141 --> 00:28:00.302]  Oh my gosh, the Russians stole the election.
[00:28:00.302 --> 00:28:01.363]  Everybody wanted Hillary.
[00:28:01.363 --> 00:28:02.544]  I mean, come on.
[00:28:02.544 --> 00:28:03.484]  Don't you want Hillary?
[00:28:03.484 --> 00:28:04.565]  She's so popular.
[00:28:04.565 --> 00:28:10.007]  Even Joe Biden had to say, I know nobody likes Hillary and she's really unpopular, but you know, she's better than Trump.
[00:28:10.007 --> 00:28:12.469]  And the crowd's like, oh, I guess.
[00:28:12.469 --> 00:28:15.290]  I mean, you're the arrogant, disconnected scum.
[00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:17.431]  The Russians didn't do that.
[00:28:17.431 --> 00:28:18.512]  Give yourself credit.
[00:28:19.244 --> 00:28:20.806]  But here's Bob Bair.
[00:28:20.806 --> 00:28:26.292]  Well, he hadn't seen the evidence, but if there is evidence, which I'm sure there is, we've got to have a new election.
[00:28:26.292 --> 00:28:28.955]  They're getting ready to put us into a civil war.
[00:28:28.955 --> 00:28:30.958]  You heard it from CNN.
[00:28:30.958 --> 00:28:31.899]  What they call it?
[00:28:31.899 --> 00:28:34.522]  National Emergency.
[00:28:34.522 --> 00:28:35.643]  That's their plan.
[00:28:35.643 --> 00:28:36.244]  Let's go to it.
[00:28:37.208 --> 00:28:40.150]  The Russians, it looks like to me, did interfere in our elections.
[00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:44.372]  We'll never be able to decide whether they change the outcome.
[00:28:44.372 --> 00:28:54.238]  But I'll tell you, having worked in the CIA, if we had been caught interfering in European elections, or Asian elections, or anywhere in the world, those countries would call for new elections.
[00:28:54.238 --> 00:28:56.220]  And any democracy would.
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.101]  And I just, I don't see it any other way.
[00:28:58.101 --> 00:29:04.785]  I mean, the Electoral College before the 19th has got to know whether the Russians had an effect, whether they went to WikiLeaks,
[00:29:05.445 --> 00:29:06.946]  Whether they hacked email...
[00:29:22.253 --> 00:29:24.455]  And so stop meddling with how we voted.
[00:29:24.455 --> 00:29:26.397]  Of course we want to make America great again.
[00:29:26.397 --> 00:29:28.358]  Of course we want jobs back.
[00:29:28.358 --> 00:29:33.163]  I know you're part of the predator class and think it's all funny to keep the public poor and everything, but listen.
[00:29:33.163 --> 00:29:35.104]  Your domestication's coming to an end, buddy.
[00:29:35.104 --> 00:29:36.706]  So, you know, I gotta hand it to you.
[00:29:36.706 --> 00:29:37.967]  You got some chutzpah.
[00:29:37.967 --> 00:29:39.088]  You got some bravado.
[00:29:39.088 --> 00:29:39.888]  You got some hubris.
[00:29:40.859 --> 00:29:49.245]  Because you're really going to try to steal this from this incredibly popular president who's got the military and police firmly behind him 95%.
[00:29:49.245 --> 00:29:53.167]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.167 --> 00:29:55.829]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.032 --> 00:30:03.835]  Why is the CIA pushing this ridiculous conspiracy theory?
[00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:10.058]  Reports of Russian officials intervening in the American presidential election have been industriously circulated for months.
[00:30:10.058 --> 00:30:19.084]  The FBI, DHS, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence are all looking at the same allegations, and all of the agencies came up with the same foregone conclusion.
[00:30:19.084 --> 00:30:23.247]  Vladimir Putin's government deliberately interfered with America's presidential election.
[00:30:23.407 --> 00:30:34.978]  The laughable insinuation was reiterated this morning in an article published in The Hill, attacking President-elect Donald Trump for casting doubt on their assessment, concluding that Russia intervened in the election to help him win the White House.
[00:30:34.978 --> 00:30:40.764]  Trump tweeted out, Keep in mind, this is the same CIA that asserted false claims against Saddam Hussein and led us into the invasion of Iraq.
[00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:54.122]  With a track record like that, one must take their assessments with a serious grain of salt and question the motivation of these agencies.
[00:30:54.122 --> 00:30:56.506]  I'm Margaret Halver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:04.812]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[00:31:59.645 --> 00:32:02.287]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[00:32:02.287 --> 00:32:04.449]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[00:32:04.449 --> 00:32:13.277]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house, like small refrigerators, to keep your food from spoiling.
[00:32:13.277 --> 00:32:15.799]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[00:32:15.799 --> 00:32:21.664]  It's mobile, to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[00:32:21.664 --> 00:32:25.047]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity.
[00:32:25.387 --> 00:32:28.810]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:29.831]  A true innovation.
[00:32:29.831 --> 00:32:31.912]  I have never seen anything like this.
[00:32:31.912 --> 00:32:33.614]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[00:32:33.614 --> 00:32:36.156]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[00:32:36.156 --> 00:32:40.339]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[00:32:40.339 --> 00:32:42.441]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.
[00:32:42.441 --> 00:32:44.483]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[00:32:44.483 --> 00:32:45.263]  And check this out.

[00:33:17.696 --> 00:33:23.698]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:26.579 --> 00:33:28.700]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:35.223]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:33:35.223 --> 00:33:37.904]  I'm sitting back really pinching myself.
[00:33:37.904 --> 00:33:38.704]  Am I dreaming?
[00:33:38.704 --> 00:33:43.846]  I mean, we're in the middle of open world government being announced.
[00:33:43.846 --> 00:33:47.828]  We've got the corporate media with almost no ratings that's in cardiac arrest.
[00:33:49.776 --> 00:33:55.418]  Only intensifying their efforts to cause a civil war in the country and basically admitting it.
[00:33:55.418 --> 00:34:01.919]  And now they're saying they want to unseat the elected president because he's a Russian agent.
[00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:04.680]  They have actually called me a Russian agent.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.180]  And they've called Tucker Carlson last Thursday.
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.281]  We played it last Friday.
[00:34:08.281 --> 00:34:15.383]  A congressman was on, a Democrat, and said, oh, that's because you're a Russian operative.
[00:34:15.383 --> 00:34:16.183]  No, you!
[00:34:17.731 --> 00:34:20.052]  You are globalist operatives!
[00:34:20.052 --> 00:34:35.161]  You are the open New World Order megabanks that have hijacked this country and almost every other country in the world and run it in the ground and your philosophy is to make us poor and make us fight with each other while you rule over us and we don't want to do that anymore!
[00:34:40.169 --> 00:34:43.531]  And now they're openly calling for censoring the free and independent press.
[00:34:43.531 --> 00:34:46.493]  I extended the petition out through the weekend.
[00:34:46.493 --> 00:34:49.375]  We're now over 150,000 signatures.
[00:34:49.375 --> 00:34:56.560]  We're a Senate to Trump, we're a Senate to Congress, calling for President-elect to do something about the calls to end the First Amendment.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:07.587]  You know, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or the freedom of the press, or the people to rightfully assemble.
[00:35:08.942 --> 00:35:11.123]  And petition their government for redress of grievances?
[00:35:11.123 --> 00:35:13.065]  I'm going from memory.
[00:35:13.065 --> 00:35:14.045]  I'm so flustered.
[00:35:14.045 --> 00:35:17.848]  Can we put the First Amendment on screen for me so I can read it properly?
[00:35:17.848 --> 00:35:21.270]  It's the First Amendment for a reason.
[00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:30.876]  And you've got the CIA in the middle of this with Obama saying, we've got evidence they were involved.
[00:35:30.876 --> 00:35:37.641]  The Russians were involved on covering Trump favorably in their news and some of that limited news got into the U.S.
[00:35:39.704 --> 00:35:44.045]  Well, I mean, I was favorable towards the Brexit, and I support Nigel Farage.
[00:35:44.045 --> 00:35:45.986]  Of course, that's how that works.
[00:35:45.986 --> 00:35:48.266]  There were a lot of Brits who were supportive of Trump.
[00:35:48.266 --> 00:35:56.528]  I think there was more Brit support than Russian support, because they speak the same language, and it's part of the same culture of the English-speaking peoples.
[00:35:56.528 --> 00:36:01.649]  Written about by Churchill in his three-volume set that I've read, The History of the English-Speaking Peoples.
[00:36:01.649 --> 00:36:02.369]  It's excellent.
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:03.530]  You should read it.
[00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:07.691]  But, was it like secret agents?
[00:36:07.691 --> 00:36:08.451]  Absolutely not.
[00:36:10.106 --> 00:36:17.973]  Russia has a kinship to us because they've been under the same oligarchs, the same very central banks.
[00:36:17.973 --> 00:36:30.945]  So I'm going to get into these clips here in a moment and then get into the other news, but there's really no way to overstate the unprecedented peril that this country and this world is in right now.
[00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:40.359]  Unprecedented with the CIA involved, and electors getting ready to vote against Trump, and all this other garbage.
[00:36:40.359 --> 00:36:49.891]  I'm here to tell you, under continuity of government systems, if there really was someone put in by the Russians, then the directives are to move to remove them.
[00:36:51.633 --> 00:37:05.316]  This is the cover they need inside government to pretend they're a bunch of patriots and try to organize enough people out of agencies to make a move against Trump to remove him or even assassinate him.
[00:37:05.316 --> 00:37:07.497]  And it can go a lot of different ways.
[00:37:07.497 --> 00:37:10.097]  They announce the electors aren't going for Trump.
[00:37:10.097 --> 00:37:13.138]  Next time he gets on board his plane, it blows up.
[00:37:13.138 --> 00:37:14.638]  And they'll just say it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:37:14.638 --> 00:37:15.818]  We don't know why it blew up.
[00:37:15.818 --> 00:37:16.979]  Don't ask why it blew up.
[00:37:16.979 --> 00:37:17.699]  That's how
[00:37:19.139 --> 00:37:20.159]  Brazen they are.
[00:37:20.159 --> 00:37:30.183]  Because they want a riot, they want a civil war, then they can bring in their control because they can't win a peaceful information war.
[00:37:30.183 --> 00:37:36.526]  We are defeating them, we are absolutely running the tables against them, we are annihilating them in the information war.
[00:37:36.526 --> 00:37:39.267]  And short-term, mid-term, long-term, it just gets better for us.
[00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:44.053]  That's why they want to start a global war, an economic collapse.
[00:37:44.053 --> 00:37:46.955]  It's why they want to create civil unrest.
[00:37:46.955 --> 00:37:49.097]  And by the way, we're in a national emergency.
[00:37:49.097 --> 00:37:50.678]  I keep saying national emergency.
[00:37:50.678 --> 00:37:51.819]  We're in a national emergency.
[00:37:51.819 --> 00:37:54.141]  And some people say, oh, you're fear-mongering.
[00:37:54.141 --> 00:37:55.482]  Where's the national emergency?
[00:37:55.482 --> 00:37:59.065]  When you've got foreign globalist banks financing billions
[00:37:59.505 --> 00:38:05.709]  To fund leftist groups, to go out and burn buildings and shoot cops in the back of the head, you're in a national emergency.
[00:38:05.709 --> 00:38:19.277]  When you've got George Soros that's overthrown more than 25 countries, last time I checked it's probably 30 or more, who finances the collapse of civilizations, openly involved in destabilization, we're in an emergency.
[00:38:20.854 --> 00:38:23.035]  And people better get that through your head.
[00:38:23.035 --> 00:38:25.997]  We're witnessing the attempted takedown of America.
[00:38:25.997 --> 00:38:28.218]  The globalists were already pretty much in control.
[00:38:28.218 --> 00:38:36.162]  They were trying to mop up the states, bring in speech controls, bring in censorship of the free press, and bring in gun control.
[00:38:36.162 --> 00:38:44.306]  They were already saying, your kids belong to us, forced inoculations, the borders are wide open, Obama's above the law, we can do whatever we want.
[00:38:45.168 --> 00:38:47.189]  The CIA can be involved domestically.
[00:38:47.189 --> 00:38:55.534]  They were already rolling it out, and patriots in government mainly rallied with the Liberty Movement, and we took the country back.
[00:38:55.534 --> 00:38:57.735]  Russia obviously cheered it on.
[00:38:57.735 --> 00:38:59.276]  So did the Brits who just had Brexit.
[00:38:59.276 --> 00:39:00.857]  So do the Greeks who are trying to get out of it.
[00:39:00.857 --> 00:39:07.581]  The Italians just voted to stop EU expansion, and they're over there in the news saying it must have been the Russkies.
[00:39:07.581 --> 00:39:09.942]  No, the Italians are already under the EU.
[00:39:09.942 --> 00:39:12.324]  They already have to pay for a lot of the EU programs, like the Germans do.
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.122]  Don't get stuff back.
[00:39:15.122 --> 00:39:24.012]  And so, they voted to not give EU veto power over their Congress, over their Parliament.
[00:39:24.012 --> 00:39:25.614]  They voted against EU expansion.
[00:39:25.614 --> 00:39:32.963]  That's EU's response people are going to pull out is, we'll just expand total authority and have an EU army march in and take over.
[00:39:32.963 --> 00:39:33.864]  Italy said no.
[00:39:35.063 --> 00:39:38.104]  They're in the news saying Italy was influenced by Russians.
[00:39:38.104 --> 00:39:39.225]  Same thing this weekend.
[00:39:39.225 --> 00:39:44.967]  Merkel, she's losing seats in Parliament because of the Russkies!
[00:39:44.967 --> 00:39:50.430]  Instead of saying the dog ate your homework, just say Vladimir Putin ate it.
[00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:51.750]  Oh, you didn't get an A in school?
[00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:52.991]  Say Vladimir Putin did it.
[00:39:52.991 --> 00:39:53.911]  You lost your job?
[00:39:53.911 --> 00:39:54.811]  Say Vladimir Putin did it.
[00:39:54.811 --> 00:40:00.394]  You know, if I fall down, if I slip on a banana peel, I'm going to blame the Russians.
[00:40:02.062 --> 00:40:06.983]  If I eat too much cake and get fat, I'm going to blame Daria who works at the office who was born in Russia.
[00:40:06.983 --> 00:40:10.404]  It's her fault!
[00:40:10.404 --> 00:40:12.965]  But see, they don't even want you to buy this propaganda.
[00:40:12.965 --> 00:40:18.487]  They just want the legalese cover in their own minds to claim there was foreign Russian involvement.
[00:40:19.249 --> 00:40:32.194]  And now PolitiFact is saying that Reince Priebus is wrong because, I saw this during the break, because he told NBC's Chuck Todd, his other Democratic Party operative, taking over the media, that what's your proof?
[00:40:32.194 --> 00:40:32.974]  You don't have any proof.
[00:40:32.974 --> 00:40:34.155]  You don't have a source.
[00:40:34.155 --> 00:40:39.197]  Oh no, Defense Intelligence said Russia has the ability to hack U.S.
[00:40:39.197 --> 00:40:39.977]  systems.
[00:40:39.977 --> 00:40:42.538]  The ability is not doing it.
[00:40:42.538 --> 00:40:45.880]  Reince Priebus falsely claims no conclusive report whether Russia tried to influence election.
[00:40:47.697 --> 00:40:51.981]  Same folks that told you Obamacare was free.
[00:40:51.981 --> 00:40:53.201]  They're ruling!
[00:40:53.201 --> 00:40:57.605]  Oh, mainstream media politifact says so.
[00:40:57.605 --> 00:41:04.411]  Now before I go any further into all this, it's time to hit our knees and pray to God for providence, and that Donald Trump be protected.
[00:41:04.411 --> 00:41:17.101]  I'm also going to get into some of the things Trump's doing that I don't personally like, but overall, he's got them hopping mad because he's not a globalist, and they're trying to remove him, they're trying to sabotage him, and I know he's moving forward like he's the president,
[00:41:18.257 --> 00:41:21.400]  Doing more than Obama's done in eight years to get us jobs.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.142]  He's acting like the Commander-in-Chief.
[00:41:23.142 --> 00:41:25.945]  He basically already is the Commander-in-Chief.
[00:41:25.945 --> 00:41:29.869]  But he understands how serious this is, but he's just moving forward as President.
[00:41:29.869 --> 00:41:33.513]  So when they try to say he's not the President, the people say no en masse.
[00:41:33.513 --> 00:41:38.659]  The problem is, they don't care if the majority of Americans understand what's happening, or that Trump's legal and lawful.
[00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:50.734]  They just want the political cover for themselves after they assassinate him or set him up to be able to then sell the idea, at least to their own people, that what they did was right.
[00:41:50.734 --> 00:41:56.917]  So I'm telling you, Donald Trump is in grave physical danger, he's in political danger, and so are we.
[00:41:56.917 --> 00:42:02.919]  The New World Order didn't hijack this country and spend hundreds of billions of dollars doing it to just turn it over.
[00:42:02.919 --> 00:42:04.120]  They're going to fight for it.
[00:42:05.339 --> 00:42:10.161]  They knew there was a tsunami that night that defeated their attempt to steal.
[00:42:10.161 --> 00:42:11.901]  They had to reorganize.
[00:42:11.901 --> 00:42:13.362]  And I told you they'd be back.
[00:42:13.362 --> 00:42:16.143]  And 38 days out, they are back.
[00:42:16.143 --> 00:42:18.023]  Maximum alert!
[00:42:18.023 --> 00:42:19.644]  They're bringing in censorship.
[00:42:19.644 --> 00:42:20.784]  Maximum alert!
[00:42:20.784 --> 00:42:25.866]  They're using me as the poster child to shut down free speech because we're so effective.
[00:42:25.866 --> 00:42:27.526]  Maximum alert!
[00:42:27.526 --> 00:42:31.808]  They know the Trump crew understands that what I'm breaking down is accurate.
[00:42:32.915 --> 00:42:34.556]  That's why they're so scared.
[00:42:34.556 --> 00:42:36.797]  That's one of the reasons.
[00:42:36.797 --> 00:42:38.559]  They know the mainstream media is dead.
[00:42:38.559 --> 00:42:45.483]  They've got to move and try to discredit us now, shut us down now, or they're doomed forever.
[00:42:45.483 --> 00:42:49.926]  They are a cornered rat.
[00:42:49.926 --> 00:42:57.811]  Even the Washington Times, seeing its implosion, has joined with Sorin and is putting out fake quotes against me.
[00:42:59.124 --> 00:43:01.344]  Paul Watson wrote an article exposing it.
[00:43:01.344 --> 00:43:04.145]  Hundreds of newspapers this weekend.
[00:43:04.145 --> 00:43:09.946]  Because we carry the light of the Republic, the fire that can reignite 1776.
[00:43:09.946 --> 00:43:11.026]  We've already done it.
[00:43:11.026 --> 00:43:12.286]  You've already done it.
[00:43:12.286 --> 00:43:23.368]  Myself, the audience, all of us, the guests, interfacing synergistically, not collectively, but synergistically, is unstoppable.
[00:43:23.368 --> 00:43:25.369]  Before I go any further, we need to fund this operation.
[00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:27.029]  I want to commend you all for your support.
[00:43:27.029 --> 00:43:27.449]  That's why
[00:43:28.433 --> 00:43:36.398]  If you order by the 17th or 18th, anywhere in the United States, we can guarantee you get delivery by the United States Postal Service.
[00:43:36.398 --> 00:43:42.701]  You can also click on there and get it by UPS or FedEx if you'd like and get it even faster.
[00:43:42.701 --> 00:43:48.044]  And we're running, again, this matches the biggest specials we've had so far in the last 12 months.
[00:43:48.044 --> 00:43:50.766]  We've only done a sale like this two other times.
[00:43:50.766 --> 00:43:52.747]  One about a month ago and one a few months before that.
[00:43:52.747 --> 00:43:54.228]  I tend to do this towards the end of the year.
[00:43:56.072 --> 00:43:58.073]  We have free shipping store-wide.
[00:43:58.073 --> 00:43:59.534]  We were going to have a special each day.
[00:43:59.534 --> 00:44:00.775]  I just said, you know what?
[00:44:00.775 --> 00:44:01.856]  Change it this morning.
[00:44:01.856 --> 00:44:04.138]  I said, I want everything discounted.
[00:44:04.138 --> 00:44:06.459]  Between 50 and 30% off.
[00:44:06.459 --> 00:44:11.763]  The lowest discount is 25% off on BioTrue Selenium because it's already so inexpensive.
[00:44:11.763 --> 00:44:13.064]  Super high quality.
[00:44:13.064 --> 00:44:17.887]  Brain Force Plus with 20% more is also 25% off.
[00:44:17.887 --> 00:44:19.889]  Super Mel Vitality has a big discount.
[00:44:20.729 --> 00:44:28.317]  Survival Shield X2, Secret 12, Vitamin B12, Living Defense, Colloidal Silver's 50% off.
[00:44:28.317 --> 00:44:33.402]  We brought back the 25% off on DNA Force, but that's while supplies last.
[00:44:33.402 --> 00:44:35.664]  It's gonna sell out any day now.
[00:44:35.664 --> 00:44:37.806]  Bio PCA, hair, skin, and nails.
[00:44:37.806 --> 00:44:42.711]  At $19.95, it's already the lowest price you're ever gonna find, with free shipping on top of it.
[00:44:42.711 --> 00:44:43.412]  Unbelievable.
[00:44:44.412 --> 00:44:53.241]  Leading hair, skin, and nail formulas that cost $45 to $60 to $70 to $80 have less dosages of the very same things that are in this.
[00:44:53.241 --> 00:44:55.784]  There's some products out there that are total rip-offs, folks.
[00:44:55.784 --> 00:45:01.310]  You see, if I can get something really inexpensive that's high quality, I'll just sell it super discounted.
[00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:02.871]  This is the same stuff you get in salons for $60.
[00:45:05.367 --> 00:45:09.189]  They've got seven times the markup at those salons, folks, when it's $65.
[00:45:09.189 --> 00:45:12.531]  This is $19.95, and we make $10!
[00:45:12.531 --> 00:45:14.833]  We make a good profit to fund the op!
[00:45:14.833 --> 00:45:18.435]  I mean, I have to give people a good deal.
[00:45:18.435 --> 00:45:19.516]  And I want to thank you for the support.
[00:45:20.359 --> 00:45:21.480]  Living Defense, 30% off.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.500]  Silver Bullet, 50% off.
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:23.561]  Brain Force, 30% off.
[00:45:23.561 --> 00:45:24.701]  Winter Sun, 25% off.
[00:45:24.701 --> 00:45:26.582]  Survival Shield, 30% off.
[00:45:26.582 --> 00:45:27.543]  That's a big deal.
[00:45:27.543 --> 00:45:28.924]  Biotruselenium.
[00:45:28.924 --> 00:45:30.725]  I'm sorry, they told me 25% is all they could do.
[00:45:30.725 --> 00:45:31.245]  It's 30% off.
[00:45:31.245 --> 00:45:32.666]  Excuse me.
[00:45:32.666 --> 00:45:33.466]  That's a correction.
[00:45:33.466 --> 00:45:34.447]  It's better than I said.
[00:45:34.447 --> 00:45:36.008]  Plus, store-wide free shipping.
[00:45:36.008 --> 00:45:38.389]  Order today and get guaranteed delivery by Christmas.
[00:45:38.949 --> 00:45:41.790]  This Christmas Super Sale is yet another 360 win.
[00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:45.692]  Support the operation and get super high quality products that also make great gifts.
[00:45:45.692 --> 00:45:51.675]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today and take advantage of the InfoWars 2016 Super Sale before we sell out.
[00:45:51.675 --> 00:45:55.437]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:45:55.437 --> 00:45:57.918]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're committed to this fight.
[00:45:57.918 --> 00:46:01.480]  We also... I'm somewhat of a camper, but I'm not a real outdoorsman.
[00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:05.271]  And I know CJ is a huge outdoorsman.
[00:46:05.271 --> 00:46:13.655]  He said, Alex, these thermal tents and thermal sleeping bags, because I told the crew I want the very best survival equipment where it's the highest quality at a good price.
[00:46:13.655 --> 00:46:14.455]  It's a nexus point.
[00:46:14.455 --> 00:46:16.596]  You can always buy something that's, you know, $1,000.
[00:46:16.596 --> 00:46:18.277]  It's better.
[00:46:18.277 --> 00:46:21.299]  We're talking about tents for $149, sleeping bags for $59, water packs for $54.
[00:46:21.299 --> 00:46:22.119]  It's all there.
[00:46:22.119 --> 00:46:25.120]  These are the very best brand names.
[00:46:31.434 --> 00:46:33.496]  That aren't even available in many stores.
[00:46:33.496 --> 00:46:36.138]  These folks are patriots, they're listeners.
[00:46:36.138 --> 00:46:38.861]  There's no reviews yet, but you can go check these.
[00:46:38.861 --> 00:46:48.910]  These are the highest quality survival thermal tents and sleeping bags and water systems where you put your own bottle internally so you can change it up.
[00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:50.151]  It's amazing.
[00:46:50.151 --> 00:46:52.253]  So, brand names, highest quality.
[00:46:52.253 --> 00:46:57.118]  When you purchase them at InfoWarsTore.com, you're funding our operation and you make it all possible.
[00:46:59.835 --> 00:47:02.501]  And trust me, we're under incredible attack.
[00:47:02.501 --> 00:47:04.366]  We have stove and a can for $4.95.
[00:47:04.366 --> 00:47:07.713]  This is just great for camping.
[00:47:07.713 --> 00:47:09.678]  But while you're at it, support the InfoWar.
[00:47:10.663 --> 00:47:14.947]  And while you're at it, have backup supplies in case the power goes out, in case there's a war.
[00:47:14.947 --> 00:47:17.909]  Whatever the case is, being self-sufficient is the answer.
[00:47:17.909 --> 00:47:25.096]  Not because we're living in fear, but because we're living awake, and involved, and informed, and prepared, and knowing how to use firearms.
[00:47:25.096 --> 00:47:29.480]  You know, I've gone from only going to shooting four or five times a year, I got so busy, I'm trying to shoot every week right now.
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.101]  I'm finally not playing games.
[00:47:31.101 --> 00:47:32.782]  I'm getting my concealed carry this week.
[00:47:32.782 --> 00:47:35.444]  You'd think I'd have it, but I've been fighting so hard, I haven't done it.
[00:47:35.444 --> 00:47:37.005]  Plus, I don't live in fear.
[00:47:37.005 --> 00:47:39.667]  But the threats are serious enough now that I'm packing.
[00:47:39.667 --> 00:47:44.371]  So, and believe me, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:47:44.371 --> 00:47:45.732]  The globalists are activating.
[00:47:45.732 --> 00:47:46.953]  Their minions are activating.
[00:47:46.953 --> 00:47:48.174]  They're coming out of hibernation.
[00:47:48.174 --> 00:47:50.256]  They're coming out of sleeper cell mode.
[00:47:50.256 --> 00:47:51.236]  It's a cult, folks.
[00:47:51.236 --> 00:47:55.460]  I had a guy, looked like an in-shape, you know, 56, 57-year-old professor type.
[00:47:58.246 --> 00:48:03.690]  Get in my face this weekend and say that I was wrong for not supporting world government.
[00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:08.453]  I mean, it's just, they're upset, they're angry, they're bowed up.
[00:48:08.453 --> 00:48:11.455]  They're tied into this big, sick, mental ill system.
[00:48:11.455 --> 00:48:18.420]  They're really not successful themselves, but by imagining they're part of the sellout, they're deluded enough to buy into it.
[00:48:19.998 --> 00:48:21.419]  We have the Christmas Super Sale.
[00:48:21.419 --> 00:48:24.141]  I want to add that because it's so politically incorrect.
[00:48:24.141 --> 00:48:25.162]  Hey, it's America.
[00:48:25.162 --> 00:48:26.483]  Hey, it's a Christian holiday.
[00:48:26.483 --> 00:48:27.684]  So what if you're not a Christian?
[00:48:27.684 --> 00:48:28.965]  Take advantage of the sales.
[00:48:28.965 --> 00:48:34.949]  Christmas Super Sale specials.
[00:48:34.949 --> 00:48:37.291]  But if you're not a Christian, I don't mean the big fake churches out there.
[00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:52.575]  But really, in a relationship with God, I would tell you that it is important to try to understand there's a whole other world out there, and the globalists hate Christians for a reason, because the spirit of it is what powered 1776, and they don't like that energy, they don't like that spirit.
[00:48:53.629 --> 00:48:56.452]  But again, bio-crystallinium, all of it, store-wide free shipping.
[00:48:56.452 --> 00:49:00.577]  You can sign up for auto-ship and get an additional 10% off.
[00:49:00.577 --> 00:49:06.464]  So, you add all these specials together, we're selling a lot of these different products at cost at infowarestore.com.
[00:49:06.464 --> 00:49:08.647]  And again, I want to salute you and thank you for your support.
[00:49:08.647 --> 00:49:09.208]  And in closing...
[00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:17.615]  There's a comment deal on your checkout, there on your receipt, that you're going to have mailed to you.
[00:49:17.615 --> 00:49:22.558]  So you can put a comment in there that's actually to your friends, your family, your neighbors, your community.
[00:49:22.558 --> 00:49:35.988]  If you want to give a gift of X-Tube, or the gift of Biotrue Selenium, or the gift of Super Female Vitality, or a sleeping bag, or a book, or a film, like a Marageddon, thousands of items.
[00:49:35.988 --> 00:49:39.471]  Well, all you do is you go purchase it, you put the address of where you want it sent,
[00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:42.871]  And you put in the comment the card.
[00:49:42.871 --> 00:50:00.941]  So when they read the receipt, hey Bill or hey Carol or you know, hey Sanchez or whoever you're talking to, you're sending them the information, you're sending them the gift, they open it up and they know that it's then to them with a little card inside on the receipt.
[00:50:00.941 --> 00:50:03.182]  That's another way to help friends, help family.
[00:50:03.182 --> 00:50:05.483]  Take Matt.
[00:50:05.483 --> 00:50:06.364]  He started taking
[00:50:07.827 --> 00:50:14.810]  Without me even knowing the survival shield x2 iodine because he read a book about iodine and how it boosted IQs and all the rest of it.
[00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:16.611]  And I said, man, you seem really focused lately.
[00:50:16.611 --> 00:50:18.311]  He said, yeah, I've been on that about a month.
[00:50:18.311 --> 00:50:20.572]  And he said, I was at the detox a few weeks ago.
[00:50:20.572 --> 00:50:21.933]  Then suddenly I'm so clear headed.
[00:50:21.933 --> 00:50:23.473]  It's like I'm flying.
[00:50:23.473 --> 00:50:24.674]  It's exactly what you talked about.
[00:50:25.305 --> 00:50:26.847]  I don't know how it all metabolically works.
[00:50:26.847 --> 00:50:40.221]  I mean, I've been told, but I'm not going to attempt to go over it all, but it pushes out the bad garbage, it fills your glands, your thyroid with what it needs, then they activate, and then the whole electrochemical system in the body begins to operate like it should.
[00:50:40.221 --> 00:50:44.385]  You fuse X2 with biotrue selenium from the mustard seed we have?
[00:50:45.026 --> 00:50:47.747]  Electrochemical, it's absolutely key, you'll die without it.
[00:50:47.747 --> 00:50:52.990]  Both these, both these compounds, it is explosive, what I've personally experienced.

[00:54:17.549 --> 00:54:19.709]  You know, I should tell you about the guests that are coming up today.
[00:54:19.709 --> 00:54:22.050]  But I've been too busy.
[00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:26.311]  Hyperventilating over the CIA involved in our elections.
[00:54:26.311 --> 00:54:29.352]  Open calls for national civil emergencies.
[00:54:29.352 --> 00:54:30.652]  Kicking Trump out of office.
[00:54:30.652 --> 00:54:32.472]  Having the delegates.
[00:54:32.472 --> 00:54:33.712]  They get two more delegates.
[00:54:33.712 --> 00:54:35.053]  They've got two right now.
[00:54:35.053 --> 00:54:38.874]  They get two more similar delegates.
[00:54:38.874 --> 00:54:40.254]  Or electors, as they're called.
[00:54:41.468 --> 00:54:48.930]  To take the electoral votes away, you could see Trump behind Hillary, and I guess they're going to try to put Hillary in office.
[00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:51.531]  People keep thinking that's too bold, that's too insane.
[00:54:51.531 --> 00:54:57.893]  They wouldn't have the CIA all over TV, saying we've got to have a new election if this wasn't the case.
[00:54:57.893 --> 00:54:59.294]  They mean to try it.
[00:54:59.294 --> 00:55:00.474]  These are bold criminals.
[00:55:01.718 --> 00:55:08.301]  Because again, after they committed all those crimes, after they did all that stuff, nobody got in trouble, even though it's all in the WikiLeaks.
[00:55:08.301 --> 00:55:11.082]  And on the surface, Trump's been saying, oh, I'm going to back off.
[00:55:11.082 --> 00:55:13.724]  Hillary's been through enough.
[00:55:13.724 --> 00:55:16.505]  Well, notice, Trump, that they're coming after you.
[00:55:16.505 --> 00:55:18.446]  That's what I've told him when I've been on the phone with him.
[00:55:18.446 --> 00:55:21.047]  I've said, Mr. President-elect, they're not going to stop.
[00:55:21.047 --> 00:55:22.588]  They're never going to stop.
[00:55:22.588 --> 00:55:23.508]  They're never going to stop.
[00:55:23.508 --> 00:55:25.269]  You have to get on the offense against them.
[00:55:26.937 --> 00:55:29.698]  Well, I'm just going to focus on cutting taxes and getting the economy going.
[00:55:29.698 --> 00:55:32.019]  That's what will show the people they can have prosperity.
[00:55:32.019 --> 00:55:34.539]  I'm like, I know, but it isn't like a business deal.
[00:55:34.539 --> 00:55:35.900]  This is a mafia.
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:39.301]  And I'm not saying I lecture the president, but he knows.
[00:55:39.301 --> 00:55:44.702]  They think he's going after him when he gets in because of sessions and other things he's done.
[00:55:44.702 --> 00:55:46.883]  But this is a serious war.
[00:55:46.883 --> 00:55:48.283]  We're in a war right now.
[00:55:48.283 --> 00:55:51.644]  In fact, the war got worse once he became president elect.
[00:55:51.644 --> 00:55:55.626]  And that's what that's what Michael Savage always said when he was on before the election.
[00:55:55.626 --> 00:55:56.406]  We should get him back on.
[00:55:57.506 --> 00:55:58.706]  Michael Schneider is coming on.
[00:55:58.706 --> 00:56:03.108]  He's been writing extensively about how they're trying to bring in civil emergency and the different angles.
[00:56:03.108 --> 00:56:05.428]  And then Wayne Madsen, always informative.
[00:56:05.428 --> 00:56:07.489]  Formerly with the National Security Agency will be joining us.
[00:56:07.489 --> 00:56:09.209]  And David Knight in the fourth hour.
[00:56:09.209 --> 00:56:12.410]  Before I go any further, let's play some of those clips.
[00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:16.871]  Here's Bolton saying Russian hack could have been an Obama false flag.
[00:56:16.871 --> 00:56:18.252]  I thought false flags didn't exist.
[00:56:18.252 --> 00:56:20.252]  But clearly, did you ever think of that?
[00:56:20.252 --> 00:56:22.633]  They could hack from outside the country.
[00:56:22.633 --> 00:56:25.874]  They say if it comes from Russia, it could be a guy in a hotel room in Russia, an American,
[00:56:26.534 --> 00:56:31.988]  Or anybody else, or a mercenary, then we've got to physically attack Russia.
[00:56:31.988 --> 00:56:33.792]  That's the parameters they're setting up.
[00:56:33.792 --> 00:56:34.514]  Let's go to that club.
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:47.869]  We have to know the facts here and it's not at all clear to me, just viewing this from the outside, that this hacking into the DNC and the RNC computers was not a false flag operation.
[00:56:47.869 --> 00:56:55.034]  Are you actually accusing someone here in this administration of trying to throw something?
[00:56:55.034 --> 00:56:56.495]  We just don't know.
[00:56:56.495 --> 00:57:02.399]  But I believe that intelligence has been politicized in the Obama administration to a very significant degree.
[00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:03.740]  Sure, they get caught all the time.
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:05.702]  Now let's go out to break with Rentz Priebus.
[00:57:05.702 --> 00:57:06.843]  Challenges Chuck Todd.
[00:57:06.843 --> 00:57:08.204]  What is your source?
[00:57:08.204 --> 00:57:10.006]  And they admit they're not saying the source.
[00:57:10.006 --> 00:57:14.990]  They're saying a secret report with the CIA's history of putting out nothing but fake reports.
[00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:16.011]  Here it is.
[00:57:16.011 --> 00:57:25.000]  But what I don't want to do, Chuck, is have a debate with you over an unnamed source that the article said was inconclusive over who hacked and why they hacked.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.141]  Look, someone hacked.
[00:57:26.681 --> 00:57:27.701]  We don't like that.
[00:57:27.701 --> 00:57:28.822]  I don't like it.
[00:57:28.822 --> 00:57:29.662]  No one wants it.
[00:57:29.662 --> 00:57:31.403]  We want to protect American interests.
[00:57:31.403 --> 00:57:32.303]  It's America first.
[00:57:32.303 --> 00:57:33.864]  I don't want the DNC hacked.
[00:57:33.864 --> 00:57:35.325]  I don't want anybody hacked.
[00:57:35.325 --> 00:57:37.326]  But I don't know who did the hacking.
[00:57:37.326 --> 00:57:38.366]  That's my point.
[00:57:38.366 --> 00:57:41.387]  You dispute 17 different intelligence agencies that have assessed that Russia agents were behind this.
[00:57:52.172 --> 00:58:05.322]  I dispute you a Democratic Party hack known for lying who's been caught in WikiLeaks emails coordinating fake news reports, shitting or changing the subject from your corruption in these emails that were illegally being stored at Hillary's house.
[00:58:05.322 --> 00:58:10.045]  But you turn the whole thing around on the American people and turn us all into enemies.
[00:58:10.045 --> 00:58:13.708]  It's like the Southern Poverty Law Center says if you don't like Obamacare you're a Nazi.
[00:58:13.708 --> 00:58:16.790]  You turn the country that defeated the Nazis into Nazis.
[00:58:18.271 --> 00:58:20.412]  We're going to come back and finish up the rest of this clip.
[00:58:20.412 --> 00:58:24.614]  Just looking at the arrogance of Chuck Todd, the anger, the belligerence.
[00:58:24.614 --> 00:58:27.955]  They all have this spirit about them of just nastiness.
[00:58:27.955 --> 00:58:29.876]  These are enemies of this country.
[00:58:29.876 --> 00:58:32.937]  And that's why they claim we're foreign assets.
[00:58:32.937 --> 00:58:33.677]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:33.677 --> 00:58:34.257]  Spread the word.
[00:58:34.257 --> 00:58:36.218]  They're trying to censor this URL.
[00:58:36.218 --> 00:58:38.459]  It's InfoWars.com.
[00:58:38.459 --> 00:58:39.119]  Jam it up there.
[00:58:39.119 --> 00:58:39.600]  You know what?
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:40.560]  They hate it.
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.841]  Ram that URL up them.
[00:58:42.841 --> 00:58:44.321]  Ram it in them.
[00:58:44.321 --> 00:58:44.822]  We are.
[00:58:44.822 --> 00:58:46.742]  We are.
[00:58:46.742 --> 00:58:47.803]  Beyond the spearhead.

[00:59:46.313 --> 00:59:52.295]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:59:52.295 --> 00:59:54.916]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:14.251 --> 01:00:19.133]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:00:19.133 --> 01:00:33.918]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:33.918 --> 01:00:38.359]  So, here is Chuck Todd, Democratic Party operative.
[01:00:38.359 --> 01:00:40.980]  He's worked at the highest levels of multiple administrations.
[01:00:42.895 --> 01:01:02.404]  There's a Clinton and, of course, Obama operative sitting there arrogantly talking to Reince Priebus, who everybody knows I don't like, but still he's telling the truth, turning it around, saying, oh, you disagree with 17 agencies.
[01:01:02.404 --> 01:01:09.848]  No, it is a secret report by the CIA, but Defense Intelligence that Michael Flynn formerly ran, thank you, just brought me water,
[01:01:11.385 --> 01:01:17.552]  Has said, of course the Russians can hack, but there's no proof they did hack this election.
[01:01:17.552 --> 01:01:23.238]  And now we have British ambassadors and others coming out saying, I've met with the real hacker.
[01:01:23.238 --> 01:01:26.802]  It's a US intelligence operative.
[01:01:26.802 --> 01:01:29.285]  That's what our sources have been saying for a long time.
[01:01:29.285 --> 01:01:30.607]  So here is this exchange.
[01:01:31.834 --> 01:01:40.816]  But what I don't want to do, Chuck, is have a debate with you over an unnamed source that the article said was inconclusive over who hacked and why they hacked.
[01:01:40.816 --> 01:01:42.516]  Look, someone hacked.
[01:01:42.516 --> 01:01:43.536]  We don't like that.
[01:01:43.536 --> 01:01:44.656]  I don't like it.
[01:01:44.656 --> 01:01:45.517]  No one wants it.
[01:01:45.517 --> 01:01:47.237]  We want to protect American interests.
[01:01:47.237 --> 01:01:48.137]  It's America first.
[01:01:48.137 --> 01:01:49.697]  I don't want the DNC hacked.
[01:01:49.697 --> 01:01:51.158]  I don't want anybody hacked.
[01:01:51.158 --> 01:01:53.178]  But I don't know who did the hacking.
[01:01:53.178 --> 01:01:54.398]  That's my point.
[01:01:54.398 --> 01:01:58.319]  The second point I make is you have no idea whether the hacking even influenced the election.
[01:01:58.459 --> 01:02:07.044]  You dispute 17 different intelligence agencies that have assessed that Russia agents were behind this.
[01:02:07.044 --> 01:02:08.005]  You dispute this?
[01:02:08.005 --> 01:02:09.706]  Chuck, this is insane.
[01:02:09.706 --> 01:02:13.648]  In the same article about those 17 agencies, the report was inconclusive.
[01:02:13.648 --> 01:02:15.769]  You're forgetting the most important piece.
[01:02:15.769 --> 01:02:19.091]  It was inconclusive about Vladimir Putin, Reince.
[01:02:19.091 --> 01:02:22.113]  It was not inconclusive that Russian agents were involved.
[01:02:22.873 --> 01:02:24.379]  There's a difference.
[01:02:24.379 --> 01:02:27.068]  And I understand why you're trying to parse this, but there is a difference.
[01:02:27.068 --> 01:02:28.072]  I'm not trying to parse it.
[01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:32.836]  I don't know who did the hacking, Chuck.
[01:02:32.836 --> 01:02:39.719]  The article is based on a lie that the RNC was hacked, so the entire premise of the article is false.
[01:02:39.719 --> 01:02:43.661]  The sources are unnamed, and the report was inconclusive.
[01:02:43.661 --> 01:02:46.382]  Listen, I don't want anyone hacked, okay?
[01:02:46.382 --> 01:02:51.765]  The point is, though, we need to find out more facts about this situation.
[01:02:51.765 --> 01:02:58.008]  Then we can make intelligent decisions later, and you and I can have a more intelligent conversation about what to do about it.
[01:03:00.290 --> 01:03:02.972]  Incredible!
[01:03:02.972 --> 01:03:16.039]  This is a Democratic Party openly run by foreign banks with George Soros, this fossilized Nazi collaborator, running around openly funding groups that go out and promote shooting police in the back.
[01:03:16.039 --> 01:03:16.779]  Four dead cops!
[01:03:16.779 --> 01:03:17.520]  It was better than that!
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.320]  Five dead cops!
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.282]  We've got it all on video!
[01:03:21.282 --> 01:03:23.683]  This is a true insurrection!
[01:03:23.683 --> 01:03:26.545]  That's why CNN says Trump's a national emergency.
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:31.623]  No, you're the national emergency trying to destabilize things.
[01:03:31.623 --> 01:03:42.250]  And then here's a Democratic congressman coming out saying, this is Eliot Engel of New York, saying, I only know what I'm reading in the newspapers.
[01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:51.856]  Well, I mean, the New York Times and the Washington Post had to retract last week that their original report about the alt-right being run by the Russians was a total lie.
[01:03:51.856 --> 01:03:54.458]  But they did it two weeks after they'd already been pushing it.
[01:03:55.683 --> 01:04:00.467]  No proof that bots were pushing InfoWars or Breitbart.
[01:04:00.467 --> 01:04:03.109]  The bots are blocking us on Facebook and Twitter.
[01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:05.411]  And were during the election as well.
[01:04:05.411 --> 01:04:06.392]  Let's go out to break with this.
[01:04:06.392 --> 01:04:10.776]  Let me ask you about that because you're a ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
[01:04:10.776 --> 01:04:18.462]  Did you hear from intelligence sources that Russia's intent was to put Donald Trump in the White House?
[01:04:18.462 --> 01:04:20.123]  I haven't heard from intelligence sources.
[01:04:20.123 --> 01:04:23.486]  I only know what I'm reading in the newspapers.
[01:04:23.486 --> 01:04:24.567]  The intelligence sources
[01:04:25.071 --> 01:04:26.834]  I'm going to come back and play this again.
[01:04:26.834 --> 01:04:28.236]  You know why this is so important?
[01:04:38.439 --> 01:04:39.880]  I'm gonna explain this again.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:42.503]  I know real people that are currently in the CIA.
[01:04:42.503 --> 01:04:46.688]  I know former folks that were high up in it, and all sorts of other agencies, okay?
[01:04:46.688 --> 01:04:47.188]  I call them.
[01:04:47.188 --> 01:04:49.531]  They say, this is not the CIA.
[01:04:49.531 --> 01:04:52.474]  Just like Trump has come out and said it's pure bull.
[01:04:52.474 --> 01:04:52.854]  Okay?
[01:04:52.854 --> 01:04:56.137]  They say it's some little subgroup that Obama interviewed.
[01:04:56.137 --> 01:04:57.138]  They put this out.
[01:04:57.138 --> 01:04:58.320]  It turns out that's the truth!
[01:04:59.764 --> 01:05:03.906]  A former Icelandic Minister of Interior is claiming that the U.S.
[01:05:03.906 --> 01:05:09.628]  sent FBI agents to frame Julian Assange during a goodwill mission to Iceland in 2011.
[01:05:09.628 --> 01:05:17.391]  Now this troubling report has come to light and it's reviewing how the Obama administration, the links that it will go to, to have framed Julian Assange.
[01:05:17.611 --> 01:05:19.093]  The minister says the U.S.
[01:05:19.093 --> 01:05:30.706]  sent, quote, a plane load of FBI agents to Iceland in June of 2011 to both frame WikiLeaks and Assange, according to this minister, who refused them any cooperation and asked them to leave the country immediately.
[01:05:30.706 --> 01:05:39.075]  He claims that the Obama administration implied to Iceland officials that they had knowledge of, quote, hackers wanting to destroy software systems in the country and offered help.
[01:05:39.275 --> 01:05:43.518]  Well, the Interior Minister, Mr. Johansson, said he became suspicious of the U.S.
[01:05:43.518 --> 01:05:47.121]  good intentions and said, quote, I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:05:59.585 --> 01:06:02.727]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:06:02.727 --> 01:06:06.830]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:09.472]  Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[01:06:09.472 --> 01:06:12.314]  I'm Charlie Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[01:06:12.314 --> 01:06:15.816]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces.
[01:06:15.816 --> 01:06:17.498]  Bent on global governance.
[01:06:18.058 --> 01:06:24.242]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[01:06:24.242 --> 01:06:30.526]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[01:06:30.526 --> 01:06:33.088]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:06:33.462 --> 01:06:34.642]  We're the solution!
[01:06:34.642 --> 01:06:35.623]  Americans!
[01:06:35.623 --> 01:06:37.143]  Ain't nothin' more to it than that!
[01:06:37.143 --> 01:06:42.524]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[01:06:42.524 --> 01:06:44.224]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[01:06:44.224 --> 01:06:45.765]  DVDs now available.
[01:06:45.765 --> 01:06:49.686]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[01:06:49.686 --> 01:06:52.506]  RevelationTheMovie.info.
[01:06:52.506 --> 01:06:55.287]  Americans need to see this film.
[01:06:55.287 --> 01:06:57.948]  RevelationTheMovie.info.
[01:06:57.948 --> 01:06:58.828]  Let's fix it.
[01:06:59.608 --> 01:07:07.075]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:07:07.075 --> 01:07:20.306]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:07:21.227 --> 01:07:33.111]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[01:07:33.111 --> 01:07:39.073]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[01:08:14.554 --> 01:08:17.201]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:08:17.201 --> 01:08:22.173]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:43.481]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into the second hour.
[01:08:43.481 --> 01:08:47.322]  Michael Schneider, great syndicated columnist, is going to be riding shotgun with us.
[01:08:47.322 --> 01:09:01.946]  David Knight is going to pop in at the bottom of the hour on his concerns of some of the appointments that Trump is attempting to make to see if they can get confirmed from Rex Tillerson to also Rick Perry, supposedly to head up energy.
[01:09:01.946 --> 01:09:05.587]  We've got this former Marine Corps General, Kelly, who headed up Guantanamo Bay.
[01:09:06.367 --> 01:09:08.609]  All I care about is they follow Trump's orders.
[01:09:08.609 --> 01:09:15.774]  We're going to see if Trump delivers on jobs, delivers on controlling the border, delivers on pulling us out of NAFTA and GATT and renegotiating.
[01:09:15.774 --> 01:09:17.055]  These will be fair.
[01:09:17.055 --> 01:09:18.516]  Americanism, not globalism.
[01:09:18.516 --> 01:09:20.957]  If he deviates, then I'm going to have some big issues.
[01:09:20.957 --> 01:09:24.240]  But I said, what do you think we should do to David just now during the break?
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:27.162]  And he goes, we need the constituents of Trump to
[01:09:28.584 --> 01:09:32.927]  Basically, let him hear from us so he's not just surrounded by Washington insiders.
[01:09:32.927 --> 01:09:34.168]  And that certainly is important.
[01:09:34.168 --> 01:09:41.234]  We should stay very engaged with Trump and his people via Twitter, via Facebook, via letters, via phone calls.
[01:09:41.234 --> 01:09:43.255]  You mail letters to Trump Tower, Donald Trump.
[01:09:44.056 --> 01:09:47.218]  He stays up till 2 in the morning a lot of times, reading hundreds of them a day.
[01:09:47.218 --> 01:09:52.561]  In fact, sometimes people say, don't tell people to write him letters, he reads them all.
[01:09:52.561 --> 01:09:56.703]  I love trying to read the letters you send me, and I'm very honored to see them.
[01:09:56.703 --> 01:09:58.544]  Little handwritten things from kids, you name it.
[01:09:58.544 --> 01:10:02.867]  But Trump really reads the letters, so that's something else you can do.
[01:10:03.749 --> 01:10:11.192]  But listen, I saw Darren McBrain, one of our reporters and one of our great graphics people, just going, I can't believe it, walking down the hall.
[01:10:11.192 --> 01:10:12.892]  He didn't see I was there.
[01:10:12.892 --> 01:10:13.613]  And I said, what's wrong?
[01:10:13.613 --> 01:10:19.155]  He goes, every TV in this place is Trump's a Russian agent, overthrow the election, overturn the election.
[01:10:19.155 --> 01:10:20.415]  They're making their move.
[01:10:20.415 --> 01:10:22.096]  They played possum.
[01:10:22.096 --> 01:10:24.417]  They tried to have the recount that showed more votes went.
[01:10:25.177 --> 01:10:26.878]  Uh, to Trump, then went to Hillary.
[01:10:26.878 --> 01:10:29.860]  You know, he gets a couple hundred thousand in the states, she gets three thousand.
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:32.461]  Oh, look, here's three thousand she didn't get, that we're wrong.
[01:10:32.461 --> 01:10:37.824]  Oh, here's two hundred thousand, you know, in, in, um, Wisconsin that, uh, we were supposed to go to him.
[01:10:37.824 --> 01:10:39.285]  Same thing in other states.
[01:10:39.285 --> 01:10:43.508]  And now there's nothing in the news about the recount because it's so embarrassing.
[01:10:44.451 --> 01:10:47.413]  And a judge shot down Jill Stein for a Pennsylvania recount.
[01:10:47.413 --> 01:10:48.433]  I say, go ahead.
[01:10:48.433 --> 01:10:50.155]  You want to spend your money for it.
[01:10:50.155 --> 01:10:52.396]  But the point is, it didn't get what they wanted.
[01:10:52.396 --> 01:10:54.617]  They want to try to delegitimize Trump.
[01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:59.220]  So now they're going with the Russia agent Engel.
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:01.782]  And notice, I want to play this clip and then go to our guest.
[01:11:01.782 --> 01:11:06.405]  You have this congressman, Elliott Engel, Democrat from New York.
[01:11:07.532 --> 01:11:08.532]  And they've got him on CNN.
[01:11:08.532 --> 01:11:15.654]  They're saying, so you've heard from the 17 agencies, just like a year ago, just like six months ago, just like two and a half weeks ago.
[01:11:15.654 --> 01:11:17.734]  It was the Washington Post, New York Times.
[01:11:17.734 --> 01:11:20.615]  Absolute proof from the CIA.
[01:11:20.615 --> 01:11:22.995]  Back then it was 15 other agencies.
[01:11:22.995 --> 01:11:24.096]  Now it's 17, I guess.
[01:11:24.096 --> 01:11:25.636]  They're just adding new ones every day.
[01:11:25.636 --> 01:11:33.378]  Because they did just create a new one Sunday that oversees the news and engages in quote propaganda against us.
[01:11:33.378 --> 01:11:34.198]  They came out and they said,
[01:11:35.452 --> 01:11:36.693]  Well, where is it?
[01:11:36.693 --> 01:11:38.014]  I guess you've met with them.
[01:11:38.014 --> 01:11:50.587]  No, all I know is what I read in the papers, because Obama has some hand-picked little special office, just like Bush did to claim WMDs in Iraq, and that's who's supposedly telling him the Russians had the capability to hack.
[01:11:50.587 --> 01:11:59.195]  And John Bolton, the former ambassador of the UN from the US, comes out and says, this looks like an Obama false flag, because there's no evidence.
[01:11:59.195 --> 01:11:59.615]  But listen!
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:01.581]  Think about this.
[01:12:01.581 --> 01:12:05.527]  The CIA, famous for overturning elections and manipulating them.
[01:12:05.527 --> 01:12:06.648]  The enemy of Donald Trump.
[01:12:06.648 --> 01:12:10.093]  He said he doesn't even want briefings from them because he can't trust them.
[01:12:10.093 --> 01:12:12.517]  Then Harry Reid comes out and says, yeah, that's true.
[01:12:12.517 --> 01:12:14.680]  We were going to give him fake reports, basically.
[01:12:16.448 --> 01:12:19.231]  Trump's getting it from Booz Allen every day.
[01:12:19.231 --> 01:12:22.294]  That's bigger than the CIA, basically.
[01:12:22.294 --> 01:12:25.698]  That is, who shares all the intelligence, is the private contractor groups.
[01:12:25.698 --> 01:12:27.841]  That's where Snowden came from.
[01:12:27.841 --> 01:12:30.704]  So I had all the agency info fused together.
[01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:34.312]  So everything's a lie about Trump.
[01:12:34.312 --> 01:12:35.053]  He's not getting briefings.
[01:12:35.053 --> 01:12:35.494]  Yes, he is.
[01:12:35.494 --> 01:12:36.635]  There's going to be a terror attack.
[01:12:36.635 --> 01:12:37.696]  It's going to be his fault.
[01:12:37.696 --> 01:12:40.881]  He took credit for Japan announcing $50 billion investment here.
[01:12:40.881 --> 01:12:45.567]  Because the head of the company said in a press conference he did it because of Trump.
[01:12:45.567 --> 01:12:46.989]  Everything he does, they spin.
[01:12:48.851 --> 01:12:52.834]  So here's that clip of the congressman saying, no, we haven't been given this intel by the CIA.
[01:12:52.834 --> 01:12:53.934]  We've been given it by the media.
[01:12:53.934 --> 01:12:55.095]  Here it is.
[01:12:55.095 --> 01:12:58.638]  Let me ask you about that because you're a ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
[01:12:58.638 --> 01:13:06.343]  Did you hear from intelligence sources that Russia's intent was to put Donald Trump in the White House?
[01:13:06.343 --> 01:13:07.984]  I haven't heard from intelligence sources.
[01:13:07.984 --> 01:13:11.426]  I only know what I'm reading in the newspapers.
[01:13:11.426 --> 01:13:15.709]  The intelligence sources have not contacted the members of Congress.
[01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:17.871]  I'm calling on the intelligence sources to
[01:13:18.943 --> 01:13:26.629]  They're planning big show trial hearings to make Trump look like the Ruski agent and try to discredit him and probably impeach him even if they can't unseat him before he gets in.
[01:13:46.545 --> 01:13:52.386]  So we're in a race to get him in, to get the prosperity going, so America's so happy they don't go along with this.
[01:13:52.386 --> 01:13:54.686]  But they're not going to go this far and stop.
[01:13:54.686 --> 01:13:57.467]  They're clearly looking at assassinating Trump.
[01:13:57.467 --> 01:14:03.948]  And the orders would basically come down from the current sitting president and say, well, there's evidence he's a Russian agent, take him out.
[01:14:03.948 --> 01:14:05.988]  And they'd find a team to try to do it.
[01:14:05.988 --> 01:14:08.789]  So this is an incredibly dangerous time.
[01:14:08.789 --> 01:14:14.450]  Now, I hate agreeing with Bolton and suddenly Priebus and suddenly Newt Gingrich, because I've been used to disagreeing with them so often.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.221]  They've been telling the truth lately.
[01:14:17.221 --> 01:14:20.083]  Gingrich has come out and said the New York Times is fake news.
[01:14:20.083 --> 01:14:22.765]  Well, they are fake news.
[01:14:22.765 --> 01:14:30.290]  So understand, this is the same group that gave us CIA reports on Yellow Cake, on anthrax in Iraq, on Niger.
[01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:30.971]  It's all lies.
[01:14:32.443 --> 01:14:36.388]  Again, the bigger issue is the national emergency they're creating.
[01:14:36.388 --> 01:14:44.839]  The fact they're trying to get delegates to not go as electors and put Trump in at the Electoral College.
[01:14:44.839 --> 01:14:50.567]  This is an incredible time to be alive and I'm here to tell you, we are
[01:14:51.736 --> 01:14:52.877]  Not out of the woods.
[01:14:52.877 --> 01:14:57.941]  I think we're in more danger now than even before the election because they arrogantly thought they could steal it.
[01:14:57.941 --> 01:15:06.928]  Now Michael Snyder's with the Economic Collapse blog, speaking of economic collapse, they want to raise interest rates right now to basically dampen the Trump recovery that you're seeing.
[01:15:06.928 --> 01:15:09.530]  I mean, they can do that any week now.
[01:15:09.530 --> 01:15:11.451]  So let me tell you folks, they're out to get us.
[01:15:11.451 --> 01:15:15.894]  So Michael Snyder joins us to cover the waterfront for the rest of the hour.
[01:15:15.894 --> 01:15:16.935]  Great to have you back, my friend.
[01:15:16.935 --> 01:15:19.037]  It's great to be with you, Alex.
[01:15:19.037 --> 01:15:20.298]  Thank you for having me on today.
[01:15:20.779 --> 01:15:29.504]  The original reason I said please get Michael Snyder on last week is you wrote this article linking to, and we'll talk about this before you leave us in the hour, but first I want to hit the Trump stuff.
[01:15:29.504 --> 01:15:34.066]  Proof that the elite really do want a global society with no possessions, no privacy and no freedom.
[01:15:34.066 --> 01:15:37.088]  And the first exhibit you link to is what they link to.
[01:15:37.088 --> 01:15:39.690]  World Economic Forum calling for world government.
[01:15:39.690 --> 01:15:40.610]  Welcome to 2030.
[01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:41.631]  I own nothing.
[01:15:41.631 --> 01:15:43.372]  Have no privacy and life's never been better.
[01:15:44.352 --> 01:15:45.594]  So, this is amazing.
[01:15:45.594 --> 01:15:48.217]  Now, you wrote last week about a secret agenda.
[01:15:48.217 --> 01:15:53.343]  Are they planning to use Russian interference as an excuse to invalidate Trump's election victory?
[01:15:53.343 --> 01:15:56.726]  Clearly, they're now doing that in a breathless way.
[01:15:56.726 --> 01:15:58.388]  So, let's cover the waterfront.
[01:15:58.388 --> 01:15:59.510]  You've heard my analysis.
[01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:00.731]  Do you agree with it?
[01:16:00.731 --> 01:16:01.912]  What do you have to add?
[01:16:01.912 --> 01:16:03.795]  I mean, my heart is beating pretty fast right now.
[01:16:04.924 --> 01:16:06.945]  I agree with you 100%, Alex.
[01:16:06.945 --> 01:16:13.729]  This is a major emergency because the establishment wasn't just going to roll over and die just because Donald Trump won the election.
[01:16:13.729 --> 01:16:19.513]  And I think they've been groping and searching for a way to go after him, and now they've settled on this Russian angle.
[01:16:19.513 --> 01:16:20.453]  And it's no accident.
[01:16:20.453 --> 01:16:22.995]  In politics, nothing happens by accident.
[01:16:23.155 --> 01:16:27.239]  And it's no accident that all of a sudden Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, U.S.
[01:16:27.239 --> 01:16:36.667]  Senators, the mainstream media, every news outlet all at once came out with this angle saying the election was not legitimate because Russia helped Donald Trump win the election.
[01:16:36.667 --> 01:16:39.690]  Of course, they offer no proof, just this CIA thing.
[01:16:39.690 --> 01:16:45.255]  But Alex, you already mentioned the Electoral College, which is just in one week the Electoral College is going to vote.
[01:16:45.255 --> 01:16:49.939]  We already know that there's at least some electors that are supposed to vote for Trump that are not going to vote for him.
[01:16:50.319 --> 01:17:02.411]  But it's not over on December 19th, because what happens subsequently, people forget January 6th, that a joint session of Congress gathers to count the electoral votes.
[01:17:02.411 --> 01:17:04.673]  And most of the time that's a formality.
[01:17:04.673 --> 01:17:09.118]  But objections can be raised to electoral votes at that time.
[01:17:09.478 --> 01:17:14.180]  Now, the last time this happened was in 2005, the second Bush election.
[01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:21.043]  And it's never really been a serious matter throughout our history, but it's a possibility.
[01:17:21.043 --> 01:17:30.647]  What has to happen is that when the electoral votes are counted, at least one representative and one senator has to file an objection in writing.
[01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:38.731]  And if that happens, then the votes that are objected to, whether it's one vote, whether it's all of them, have to be voted on by the House and by the Senate.
[01:17:39.171 --> 01:17:45.093]  And any votes that the objection is upheld are not counted.
[01:17:45.093 --> 01:17:59.776]  And I got this from the official website of the House of Representatives, House.gov, in which they say that any votes that are objected to, and the Congress passes that objection, they're not counted toward the vote total for that individual.
[01:17:59.776 --> 01:18:00.076]  That's right.
[01:18:00.076 --> 01:18:01.117]  That's official.
[01:18:01.117 --> 01:18:02.337]  That's the law.
[01:18:02.337 --> 01:18:04.637]  So it won't go to Hillary, but it'll go against Trump.
[01:18:04.637 --> 01:18:06.298]  So if he loses enough, she wins.
[01:18:07.625 --> 01:18:13.348]  Yeah, so theoretically they could invalidate all the votes, in which case, what, do we have to have another election?
[01:18:13.348 --> 01:18:14.728]  Who knows what it is.
[01:18:14.728 --> 01:18:18.270]  Which is what the CIA is now calling for.
[01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:24.553]  Yeah, openly on CNN, an ex-CIA agent openly calling for a new vote.
[01:18:24.553 --> 01:18:28.875]  So this is an extremely dangerous situation because we've already, on Sunday, we had four U.S.
[01:18:28.875 --> 01:18:29.896]  Senators come out.
[01:18:29.896 --> 01:18:34.678]  Two of them were Republicans, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, of course, are openly the
[01:18:35.058 --> 01:18:35.819]  They hate Trump.
[01:18:35.819 --> 01:18:37.041]  They can't stand Trump.
[01:18:37.041 --> 01:18:39.344]  And they're openly saying, hey, we've got to investigate this.
[01:18:39.344 --> 01:18:41.547]  We've got to get to the bottom of this right away.
[01:18:41.547 --> 01:18:43.490]  We've got 10 U.S.
[01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:49.939]  electors, members of the electoral college, led by the daughter of Nancy Pelosi, that are calling on the U.S.
[01:18:49.939 --> 01:18:51.601]  intelligence community to brief
[01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:52.182]  All right.
[01:19:10.504 --> 01:19:23.729]  They're already touting this court decision from 1995, in which one candidate won, but then there was massive fraud found, and then the election was given to the losing candidate, just handed over by the court.
[01:19:23.729 --> 01:19:26.370]  And that was for, you know, a congressional seat.
[01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:32.052]  But they're saying this could be used to actually hand the election over to Hillary through the courts.
[01:19:32.052 --> 01:19:34.493]  So there's several different avenues they could take with this.
[01:19:34.833 --> 01:19:40.697]  Michael Schneider, here's my bottom line, and this is what I've decided to do with my audience and with my main focus.
[01:20:02.324 --> 01:20:08.266]  I'm going to really just publicly call for Trump to take the gloves off and to come out and excoriate these criminals.
[01:20:08.266 --> 01:20:19.211]  And then the minute he gets into office, the gloves have to come off, brass knuckles have to go on, and we have to go ahead and move forward with grand juries for what's in the WikiLeaks and all the crimes, and we have to start indicting these people.
[01:20:19.591 --> 01:20:20.812]  Because they're never going to stop.
[01:20:20.812 --> 01:20:23.153]  These are loose terrorists.
[01:20:23.153 --> 01:20:24.994]  These are globalists in the country.
[01:20:24.994 --> 01:20:26.295]  Hell-bent on getting our guns.
[01:20:26.295 --> 01:20:27.976]  Hell-bent on bankrupting us.
[01:20:27.976 --> 01:20:31.078]  Hell-bent on ruining our healthcare system and their own documents.
[01:20:31.078 --> 01:20:31.979]  Making us helpless.
[01:20:31.979 --> 01:20:32.799]  Making us desperate.
[01:20:32.799 --> 01:20:33.980]  Making us poor.
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:35.461]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:20:35.461 --> 01:20:38.422]  And everybody from Gruber, right through to Hillary, Obama.
[01:20:38.422 --> 01:20:41.064]  All of them, Obama ordering the borders wide open.
[01:20:41.064 --> 01:20:42.085]  And then trying to keep it secret.
[01:20:42.825 --> 01:20:44.325]  That is sedition.
[01:20:44.325 --> 01:20:47.266]  That is true treason against this country.
[01:20:47.266 --> 01:20:49.547]  And I'm sorry, I'm not a vindictive person.
[01:20:49.547 --> 01:20:50.967]  They're never going to back off.
[01:20:50.967 --> 01:20:52.808]  They're never going to give up.
[01:20:52.808 --> 01:20:59.629]  They're talking about going into insurrection terror mode in major newspapers, saying it's time to burn things down and blow things up.
[01:20:59.629 --> 01:21:02.690]  And the media just sits there, and the Secret Service just sits there.
[01:21:02.690 --> 01:21:05.671]  We have to start removing this enemy force.
[01:21:05.671 --> 01:21:07.811]  I have met them, I know them, I've seen them.
[01:21:07.811 --> 01:21:09.832]  They say, we are for global government.
[01:21:09.832 --> 01:21:10.972]  We are against the family.
[01:21:11.252 --> 01:21:11.934]  We are here.
[01:21:11.934 --> 01:21:13.398]  We will assimilate you.
[01:21:13.398 --> 01:21:14.401]  They are a cult.
[01:21:14.401 --> 01:21:15.805]  They're never backing down.
[01:21:15.805 --> 01:21:17.108]  And Trump has to run them over.
[01:21:18.539 --> 01:21:24.042]  Yeah, Trump better be ready for the fight of his life, because just because he won the election, that's not the end of the war.
[01:21:24.042 --> 01:21:27.764]  That's the beginning of the war, because now the elite are in full-blown panic mode.
[01:21:27.764 --> 01:21:29.985]  And total offense is the only way.
[01:21:29.985 --> 01:21:34.787]  That's what gets these rats running, not playing games with them like they're actually having a dialogue.
[01:21:34.787 --> 01:21:37.369]  There is no dialogue with these rats.
[01:21:37.369 --> 01:21:41.291]  They have a total criminal will to dominate and enslave everyone.
[01:21:41.291 --> 01:21:42.751]  They want no competition.
[01:21:42.751 --> 01:21:43.992]  They hate everyone.
[01:21:43.992 --> 01:21:47.854]  People must wrap their minds around the criminal energy of the globalists.
[01:21:49.013 --> 01:21:54.297]  Yeah, and now the other angles they tried during the election didn't work, so now it's the new McCarthyism.
[01:21:54.297 --> 01:21:55.958]  Now it's, oh, Russia.
[01:21:55.958 --> 01:21:57.199]  Everyone's a Russian agent.
[01:21:57.199 --> 01:21:59.100]  They're blaming everything... Isn't it funny?
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:04.364]  It's the leftists that have hundreds of movies about, oh, they were blacklisted and they couldn't do this and that.
[01:22:04.364 --> 01:22:10.148]  These were admitted communists that wanted to overthrow America and put conservatives in forced labor camps.
[01:22:10.148 --> 01:22:12.830]  And there was censorship in Hollywood, and I'm against it.
[01:22:12.830 --> 01:22:14.771]  But if you're a Russian, I'm against the censorship.
[01:22:14.771 --> 01:22:16.012]  You've got to prove somebody's an agent.
[01:22:16.012 --> 01:22:16.753]  Arrest their ass.
[01:22:17.293 --> 01:22:18.894]  Don't do some half measure.
[01:22:18.894 --> 01:22:25.740]  But instead, the very people that talk about blacklist all day are rubbing their hands together to shut us up.
[01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:27.322]  Oh, absolutely, Alex.
[01:22:27.322 --> 01:22:34.568]  And people in Congress, Donald Trump, he's got some allies, but even members of his own party hate him.
[01:22:34.568 --> 01:22:37.731]  There's members of the Senate that hate him, members of the House that hate him.
[01:22:37.731 --> 01:22:44.857]  So if it actually came down to a vote on January 6th, if they blew this thing up and where they're saying, OK, we've got to object to the vote,
[01:22:45.297 --> 01:22:50.141]  With Donald Trump, would the Republican Party automatically support Donald Trump?
[01:22:50.141 --> 01:22:59.167]  Or would there be enough votes joining with the Democrats in the Senate and the House to invalidate his electoral votes and block him from becoming President?
[01:22:59.167 --> 01:23:00.308]  I think this is a big thing.
[01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:01.909]  People need to start focusing on that.
[01:23:01.909 --> 01:23:04.311]  If we get through December 19th, the Electoral College
[01:23:04.651 --> 01:23:08.012]  Which is an open question because they're being openly lobbied.
[01:23:08.012 --> 01:23:11.874]  I mean, the left, the radical left, they're going gangbusters.
[01:23:11.874 --> 01:23:13.594]  They want to do whatever they can.
[01:23:13.594 --> 01:23:21.977]  People like Michael Moore correctly saying Donald Trump has not been elected yet because the next president of the United States is actually not elected until December 19th.
[01:23:21.977 --> 01:23:23.278]  Exactly, you stole my thunder.
[01:23:23.278 --> 01:23:24.998]  Michael Moore loves to look like he's smart.
[01:23:24.998 --> 01:23:26.999]  Now he's being given the inside intel.
[01:23:26.999 --> 01:23:28.880]  He said, watch, Trump's probably not going to get in.
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:31.321]  Something big's going to happen before the election.
[01:23:31.321 --> 01:23:32.061]  We're seeing it!
[01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:34.990]  We are seeing it.
[01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:49.795]  And so, you know, people need to be aware of what's going on because, you know, December 19th, January 6th, if we can get to January 20th and Trump is successfully inaugurated and Obama actually does hand over power to Donald Trump, maybe we can breathe a little bit easier.
[01:23:49.795 --> 01:23:56.858]  Although they'll still come after Trump every way they can, every angle they can, looking to impeach him, looking to go after him however they can.
[01:23:56.858 --> 01:23:59.379]  Because it's not just the Republicans versus the Democrats.
[01:23:59.799 --> 01:24:04.781]  It's the globalists, it's the establishment versus Trump and his few allies in Congress.
[01:24:04.781 --> 01:24:08.163]  So he's going to be fighting an uphill battle every step of the way.
[01:24:08.163 --> 01:24:10.704]  Look at this article from yesterday from Zero Hedge.
[01:24:10.704 --> 01:24:22.449]  Senate quietly passes the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act so the State Department and CIA can quote, engage in propaganda and disinformation and actually funds it against the American people.
[01:24:22.449 --> 01:24:23.650]  H.R.
[01:24:23.650 --> 01:24:23.910]  5181.
[01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:25.911]  And the Republicans helped pass this.
[01:24:25.911 --> 01:24:27.852]  And then Trump is totally mute on it.
[01:24:27.852 --> 01:24:28.312]  I'm told.
[01:24:29.758 --> 01:24:31.341]  He isn't even aware of this.
[01:24:31.341 --> 01:24:35.028]  He's busy making hundreds of calls a day to get jobs back.
[01:24:35.028 --> 01:24:41.540]  So while he's doing that, because he believes, hey, you're elected president, you're president, he still doesn't get how criminal they are.
[01:24:42.850 --> 01:24:48.635]  Yeah, Alex, and the establishment, you know, they're trying to figure out what happened in this most recent election.
[01:24:48.635 --> 01:24:57.182]  And so, you know, of course they want to deal with Trump, but they are also realizing that the alternative media is a major, major threat to them.
[01:24:57.182 --> 01:24:58.883]  They've totally woken up to this.
[01:24:58.883 --> 01:25:05.529]  And so this list, this organization, Prop or Not, that the Washington Post came out and said, hey, look at all these sites that are Russian propaganda.
[01:25:05.529 --> 01:25:10.093]  Infowars.com was on the list, but so was two of my websites, the Economic Collapse Blog
[01:25:10.413 --> 01:25:14.535]  And EndOfTheAmericanDream.com were two of the 200 or so sites.
[01:25:14.535 --> 01:25:22.498]  And by the way, your articles are great because they might be five pages long and there might be 25 hyperlinks, mainly to video clips and mainstream news.
[01:25:22.498 --> 01:25:27.460]  That's why they hate you so much, is that they'll bury some really important thing in some innocuous article.
[01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:33.862]  You'll actually go link to it, kind of like the Guardian buried it, that this top ambassador was saying he met with the real leaker, it's U.S.
[01:25:33.862 --> 01:25:34.603]  intelligence.
[01:25:34.603 --> 01:25:37.604]  That was buried in an article that didn't even have that in the headline.
[01:25:38.755 --> 01:25:55.801]  Yeah, and so they're calling me a Russian agent, which is absolutely insane, and I've written tons of articles about what a threat Russia is, and articles against Russia, but they're calling me a Russian agent just because I was pro-Trump, just because I was attacking Hillary Clinton during the campaign.
[01:25:56.281 --> 01:25:56.461]  Zane!
[01:26:12.458 --> 01:26:14.180]  They are the clear and present danger.
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:15.903]  And here's what viewers have to understand.
[01:26:15.903 --> 01:26:19.607]  Clearly, they're moving to shut down free speech.
[01:26:19.607 --> 01:26:21.810]  They're moving to try to unseat Trump.
[01:26:21.810 --> 01:26:23.793]  And notice, they knew there was total fervor.
[01:26:23.793 --> 01:26:27.377]  America was awake a month ago when Trump had just won.
[01:26:28.251 --> 01:26:30.173]  Then they began the drumbeat of recounts.
[01:26:30.173 --> 01:26:33.556]  Then they began the drumbeat of the electors.
[01:26:33.556 --> 01:26:35.157]  Because that's falling apart now.
[01:26:35.157 --> 01:26:36.698]  It's the number one story.
[01:26:36.698 --> 01:26:37.939]  He's a Russian operative.
[01:26:37.939 --> 01:26:39.481]  We're all Russian operatives.
[01:26:39.481 --> 01:26:42.323]  Doesn't matter if all that's already been discredited and retracted.
[01:26:42.323 --> 01:26:43.504]  They're back with it again.
[01:26:43.504 --> 01:26:44.945]  A secret report.
[01:26:44.945 --> 01:26:45.806]  Nobody can see.
[01:26:45.806 --> 01:26:47.568]  Congressional hearings.
[01:26:47.568 --> 01:26:48.348]  On and on and on.
[01:26:49.329 --> 01:27:05.957]  To, again, destabilize the country further, and they're doing it during Christmas, when they know you're busy buying presents and working extra hours, getting ready for the holiday, and, you know, buying a ham or a turkey, or visiting Grandma at the nursing home, or trying to go deer hunting with your son.
[01:27:05.957 --> 01:27:07.798]  They know you're trying to have a life.
[01:27:07.798 --> 01:27:12.280]  You worked real hard all year, you want a week or so off, and they're not going to let you have that.
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:16.902]  They're going to tell you, you're not Americana, you didn't vote to change things, you can't have
[01:27:17.782 --> 01:27:18.843]  An American dream?
[01:27:18.843 --> 01:27:21.004]  You can't make America great again.
[01:27:21.004 --> 01:27:26.508]  The Communist Chinese said, ha ha ha, you'll never be as great as you were officially in their People's Daily two weeks ago.
[01:27:26.508 --> 01:27:27.809]  And you can't have Trump.
[01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:30.370]  He's not an American New Yorker success story.
[01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:31.311]  He's a Russian.
[01:27:31.311 --> 01:27:34.593]  I mean, just think about how insane this is.
[01:27:34.593 --> 01:27:43.619]  Then meanwhile, Communist China was given our deepwater ports, the Panama Canal, almost all the rare earth minerals, almost all our jobs, and has screw job taxes 15% lower than ours.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:49.162]  And all we're saying is we're going to equalize that and already all the money's flooding in.
[01:27:49.162 --> 01:27:50.763]  And that's their problem, Michael Schneider.
[01:27:50.763 --> 01:27:52.244]  I'm going to talk about that with you.
[01:27:52.244 --> 01:27:54.486]  The good side of the balance.
[01:27:54.486 --> 01:27:55.846]  The bad side is they're crazy.
[01:27:55.846 --> 01:27:57.187]  They're going for broke.
[01:27:57.187 --> 01:27:58.628]  They're not going to stop even if they lose here.
[01:27:58.628 --> 01:27:59.288]  They're going to try to kill him.
[01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:04.290]  Again, there's angels in this world too, not just demons.
[01:28:04.290 --> 01:28:05.690]  So I think we're still winning.
[01:28:05.690 --> 01:28:09.411]  But the battle is hot, it's real, it's more important than ever.
[01:28:09.411 --> 01:28:11.971]  They're doing this because they think people have gone back to sleep.
[01:28:11.971 --> 01:28:13.932]  It's why they played possum for a couple weeks.
[01:28:13.932 --> 01:28:20.253]  But I've told people, my gut told me, that it's a miracle if he gets in, okay?
[01:28:20.253 --> 01:28:21.253]  I'm telling you!
[01:28:21.253 --> 01:28:23.413]  I'm telling you it's a miracle if he gets in.
[01:28:23.413 --> 01:28:24.834]  It's a total emergency.
[01:28:24.834 --> 01:28:25.754]  But the good news is,
[01:28:26.704 --> 01:28:36.515]  The good news is, irrevocable damage to the globalists, people are awake, exciting things are happening, and he's already brought back so many jobs, and already spending's up for Christmas.
[01:28:36.515 --> 01:28:40.599]  Restaurants that were empty are almost full now, or full.
[01:28:40.599 --> 01:28:43.262]  The Trump effect is happening.
[01:28:43.262 --> 01:28:45.525]  We got about a minute to break, but your view on that?
[01:28:46.849 --> 01:28:51.454]  Yeah, a new survey just came out that showed that optimism about the U.S.
[01:28:51.454 --> 01:28:55.778]  economy is the highest it has been since 2008 when Obama was first elected.
[01:28:55.778 --> 01:28:58.240]  A trillion dollars has been out of the stock market in 30 days.
[01:29:00.103 --> 01:29:04.086]  Yeah, the stock market is setting a new high after record high day after day.
[01:29:04.086 --> 01:29:04.486]  The U.S.
[01:29:04.486 --> 01:29:08.969]  dollar has surged to levels that we haven't seen in many, many years.
[01:29:08.969 --> 01:29:10.410]  And we're seeing jobs come back.
[01:29:10.410 --> 01:29:11.711]  We're seeing optimism.
[01:29:11.711 --> 01:29:17.975]  You know, before the election, 16% of Republicans were optimistic about the future of the economy.
[01:29:17.975 --> 01:29:19.636]  Now it's 74%.
[01:29:19.636 --> 01:29:25.600]  So just in 30 days, we've seen a tremendous shift in terms of how Americans are viewing the future.
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:27.381]  Yeah, the globalists are panicking, folks.
[01:29:27.381 --> 01:29:32.343]  Mexico and Nigerian places can be incredibly beautiful, wonderful, rich places.
[01:29:32.343 --> 01:29:35.664]  Their elites made decisions, this is on record, to keep people poor.
[01:29:35.664 --> 01:29:37.085]  It's a management system.
[01:29:37.085 --> 01:29:38.445]  The globalists want that here.
[01:29:38.445 --> 01:29:40.326]  We're trying to break their will.
[01:29:40.326 --> 01:29:42.147]  They're trying to break ours.
[01:29:42.147 --> 01:29:44.208]  So, we've got to reintensify our efforts.
[01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:50.279]  You've seen that we can win, now we gotta go to the next level, but you gotta ask God for guidance.
[01:29:50.279 --> 01:29:50.740]  Stay with us!
[01:29:59.893 --> 01:30:03.716]  Why is the CIA pushing this ridiculous conspiracy theory?
[01:30:03.716 --> 01:30:09.919]  Reports of Russian officials intervening in the American presidential election have been industriously circulated for months.
[01:30:09.919 --> 01:30:18.945]  The FBI, DHS, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence are all looking at the same allegations, and all of the agencies came up with the same foregone conclusion.
[01:30:18.945 --> 01:30:23.128]  Vladimir Putin's government deliberately interfered with America's presidential election.
[01:30:23.268 --> 01:30:34.861]  The laughable insinuation was reiterated this morning in an article published in The Hill, attacking President-elect Donald Trump for casting doubt on their assessment, concluding that Russia intervened in the election to help him win the White House.
[01:30:34.861 --> 01:30:35.462]  Trump tweeted out,
[01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:46.977]  Keep in mind, this is the same CIA that asserted false claims against Saddam Hussein and led us into the invasion of Iraq.
[01:30:46.977 --> 01:30:53.986]  With a track record like that, one must take their assessments with a serious grain of salt and question the motivation of these agencies.
[01:30:53.986 --> 01:30:56.390]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:30:59.554 --> 01:31:00.375]  Hey, everyone!
[01:31:00.375 --> 01:31:02.676]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:31:02.676 --> 01:31:06.518]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:31:06.518 --> 01:31:08.600]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:18.866]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:31:18.866 --> 01:31:24.850]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:40.247]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[01:31:40.287 --> 01:31:40.667]  I think so.
[01:31:59.651 --> 01:32:01.953]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[01:32:01.953 --> 01:32:03.515]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[01:32:03.515 --> 01:32:07.418]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[01:32:07.418 --> 01:32:15.365]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[01:32:15.365 --> 01:32:20.330]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[01:32:20.330 --> 01:32:25.795]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[01:32:26.135 --> 01:32:33.919]  Seeker 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[01:32:33.919 --> 01:32:38.621]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[01:32:38.621 --> 01:32:47.665]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[01:32:47.665 --> 01:32:50.887]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[01:32:55.089 --> 01:33:07.334]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:07.334 --> 01:33:11.696]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:11.696 --> 01:33:17.359]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:33:20.118 --> 01:33:24.159]  I intellectually analyze things very calmly, very coldly.
[01:33:24.159 --> 01:33:30.941]  Friends, family, neighbors have always noticed that, and they say, once you get on air, you have so much energy, you start hyperventilating, you get upset.
[01:33:30.941 --> 01:33:39.083]  Because after I've already done the analysis, then I'm up here, just as a primitive instinct, and I start getting animated and try to get the tribe motivated.
[01:33:39.083 --> 01:33:40.183]  It's not a manipulation.
[01:33:41.693 --> 01:33:44.176]  I feel like I'm dying up here sometimes.
[01:33:44.176 --> 01:33:48.900]  I'm so angry at myself that I can't find the words to describe how serious this is.
[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:52.424]  Now, Trump is delivering big time on his policies.
[01:33:53.863 --> 01:33:59.126]  He's got Congress introducing bills for nationwide concealed carry, where if you get it in one state, it's nationwide.
[01:33:59.126 --> 01:34:00.066]  They also want bills.
[01:34:00.066 --> 01:34:03.808]  He's pushing legislatures to just have open carry.
[01:34:03.808 --> 01:34:04.969]  He's bringing jobs back.
[01:34:04.969 --> 01:34:07.390]  He's doing so many big things.
[01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:08.651]  He's battling globalism.
[01:34:08.651 --> 01:34:10.312]  He's exposing one-sided trade deals.
[01:34:10.312 --> 01:34:14.814]  He's exposing monopolies like the one Bezos has with Amazon.
[01:34:16.357 --> 01:34:24.346]  But he's appointing some big establishment insiders, some outsiders, but also kind of outliers in the establishment like Rex Tillerson.
[01:34:24.346 --> 01:34:27.749]  So we're going to discuss this some with David Knight here a little bit in the next hour.
[01:34:27.749 --> 01:34:29.531]  Wayne Madsen joins us.
[01:34:29.531 --> 01:34:33.656]  But here's the key at what I'm really getting at, and of course riding shotguns also Michael Snyder.
[01:34:36.024 --> 01:34:37.605]  You can see the elite hate Trump.
[01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:38.745]  This is real.
[01:34:38.745 --> 01:34:45.948]  They're damaging themselves irrevocably with the stuff they're pulling, and they're openly pushing for him to be killed in hundreds of newspapers and magazines.
[01:34:45.948 --> 01:34:47.809]  I mean, you see it every day.
[01:34:47.809 --> 01:34:53.512]  Every major publication has writers saying, it's time to kill Trump, or I want to kill Trump, and they're not getting in trouble.
[01:34:53.512 --> 01:34:58.314]  Movie stars, directors, foreign leaders are saying, kill Trump.
[01:34:58.314 --> 01:35:00.535]  He's not the nominee now, he's the president.
[01:35:00.535 --> 01:35:00.815]  Elect.
[01:35:03.018 --> 01:35:05.059]  And I know people that have known Trump for 40 years.
[01:35:05.059 --> 01:35:06.720]  They say, no, he's an anti-New World Order guy.
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:08.961]  He was just waiting, you know, abiding his time.
[01:35:08.961 --> 01:35:14.164]  Knight did his research, found where he fought NAFTA and GATT and globalism and TPP and, you know, did that.
[01:35:14.164 --> 01:35:15.084]  So it's a mixed bag.
[01:35:15.084 --> 01:35:16.925]  And if Trump's anything, he's pigheaded.
[01:35:16.925 --> 01:35:18.026]  He's his own man.
[01:35:18.026 --> 01:35:21.787]  These guys don't like him because he wants to actually run stuff, not them.
[01:35:21.787 --> 01:35:27.470]  Let's just hope he really gets enough influence from us to get us on the right track, which is prosperity.
[01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:29.011]  Number one, that defeats globalism.
[01:35:29.011 --> 01:35:30.812]  They want us to be austere to control us.
[01:35:32.056 --> 01:35:39.158]  But I want to get our guest take on that, because he's only with us until the end of the hour, and then we'll continue with David in this hour, but also to the next hour.
[01:35:39.158 --> 01:35:42.819]  But David's over there after a week-long, well-deserved vacation, chomping on the bed.
[01:35:42.819 --> 01:35:46.420]  I saw him going wild on Twitter the last seven days.
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:51.742]  So before we go any further, I just want to remind people as well, we can't do this without you.
[01:35:51.742 --> 01:35:56.883]  And if I develop a product with top scientists and researchers, it's the best out there.
[01:35:56.883 --> 01:35:59.944]  Our DNA force, we have a limited supply left, is 25% off.
[01:35:59.944 --> 01:36:01.565]  We're extending that until it's sold out.
[01:36:02.748 --> 01:36:03.869]  That is the best.
[01:36:03.869 --> 01:36:10.173]  Bio PQQ, CoQ10, it's got a bunch of other ingredients mixed out there, and leading competitors are on average $300.
[01:36:10.173 --> 01:36:17.137]  Ours is $102 discounted, because just the Bio PQQ costs $40 to $50 depending on which batch we do.
[01:36:17.137 --> 01:36:20.159]  Just the one ingredient costs that much per bottle.
[01:36:20.159 --> 01:36:21.159]  So at $102, at $140 it's a good deal.

[01:38:14.336 --> 01:38:15.096]  Yeah.
[01:38:15.096 --> 01:38:22.225]  Thousands of sites have been listed in one group, hundreds in the Washington Post group, and the Washington Post admitted, we don't know where we got this list later.
[01:38:22.225 --> 01:38:22.906]  Yeah, CIA.
[01:38:24.397 --> 01:38:26.220]  The same folks calling for us to be censored.
[01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:31.167]  What is the CIA doing saying, deal with fake news, give us money, Congress, to shut it down.
[01:38:31.167 --> 01:38:33.271]  To engage their enemy, the American people.
[01:38:33.271 --> 01:38:35.093]  We've reached such an epic moment.
[01:38:35.093 --> 01:38:38.759]  But I'm here to tell you, I'm going to cut a video today where I just summon all my energy.
[01:38:39.591 --> 01:38:45.953]  And I'm going to reach out to Donald Trump, the best way is publicly, and say you must take the gloves off.
[01:38:45.953 --> 01:38:48.274]  Just like after you lost the first debate.
[01:38:48.274 --> 01:38:49.995]  You must get aggressive.
[01:38:49.995 --> 01:38:51.995]  You must take it to her.
[01:38:51.995 --> 01:38:53.336]  You gotta take it to them now.
[01:38:53.336 --> 01:38:59.938]  Because they're trying to bring you down, they're trying to bring us down, they're trying to overthrow this election, and we're all on the defensive
[01:39:00.879 --> 01:39:04.201]  They're acting like they have a right to do something like this.
[01:39:04.201 --> 01:39:06.343]  They had a recount, it blew up in their face.
[01:39:06.343 --> 01:39:09.325]  Now they're getting electors to say, we're not going to honor the vote.
[01:39:09.325 --> 01:39:11.787]  This is just like in the nomination process.
[01:39:11.787 --> 01:39:14.128]  They're the ones that have the explaining to do.
[01:39:14.128 --> 01:39:17.231]  They're the ones that are working for foreign banks and foreign countries.
[01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:24.998]  I want Soros investigated, not the American people claiming I'm a... They say Tucker Carlson's a Russian agent.
[01:39:24.998 --> 01:39:28.001]  Michael Schneider at EconomicCollapseBlog.com.
[01:39:28.001 --> 01:39:34.649]  Did you see that clip last Thursday where they had a Democratic congressman on to openly say to his face you're a Russian agent?
[01:39:35.859 --> 01:39:37.520]  I did see that clip, Alex.
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:39.401]  And like I said, it's the new McCarthyism.
[01:39:39.401 --> 01:39:41.002]  They're pointing at anyone.
[01:39:41.002 --> 01:39:42.043]  They're even pointing at you.
[01:39:42.043 --> 01:39:44.145]  They're pointing at me saying we're all Russian agents.
[01:39:44.145 --> 01:39:45.445]  We're all fake news.
[01:39:45.445 --> 01:39:50.729]  We've all got to be shut down because they've determined that we're a major threat to them.
[01:39:50.729 --> 01:40:05.599]  And Donald Trump, you know, even if he is able to successfully become president, people need to realize his enemies are not just the Democrats, but there are many among the Republicans in the Senate and in the House of Representatives that will gladly stab a knife in his back.
[01:40:05.759 --> 01:40:12.242]  Yeah, they just passed a bill to go after Breitbart and Infowars and your site and everybody else's and Daily Caller.
[01:40:12.242 --> 01:40:14.123]  They just signed the bill to come after us?
[01:40:14.123 --> 01:40:15.684]  Yes, the Republicans passed this!
[01:40:17.679 --> 01:40:27.064]  Yeah, absolutely, because the Republicans, you know, at this point, if the establishment could, they would like anybody to get in rather than Trump.
[01:40:27.064 --> 01:40:28.785]  It's not just about Hillary Clinton.
[01:40:28.785 --> 01:40:32.207]  If they could have a Republican replace Trump and get into the White House, they would.
[01:40:32.207 --> 01:40:44.774]  In fact, there is a plot among the electors, there is a move to try to agree on a compromise candidate, a compromise Republican candidate that they would throw votes that are supposed to go to Trump, supposed to go to Clinton.
[01:40:44.774 --> 01:40:45.815]  The word is Paul Ryan.
[01:40:47.307 --> 01:40:48.948]  Yeah, potentially Paul Ryan.
[01:40:48.948 --> 01:40:52.429]  They were talking about John Kasich, but John Kasich said, I don't want your votes.
[01:40:52.429 --> 01:40:56.051]  And I have a feeling they could potentially even settle on a Republican woman.
[01:40:56.051 --> 01:40:57.232]  We'll see what it is.
[01:40:57.232 --> 01:40:58.272]  But there's this plot.
[01:40:58.272 --> 01:41:06.776]  If they can get at least 37 votes that are supposed to go to Trump to go to someone else, well, then it gets thrown into the House of Representatives.
[01:41:06.776 --> 01:41:07.736]  I've got to give it to him.
[01:41:07.736 --> 01:41:08.477]  I've got to give it to him.
[01:41:08.477 --> 01:41:10.418]  And nobody's analysis is more on.
[01:41:11.681 --> 01:41:15.362]  On spot, but also not just on target, but so wide-ranging.
[01:41:15.362 --> 01:41:17.562]  This guy is always up to the minute.
[01:41:17.562 --> 01:41:20.683]  You know, Snyder, we ought to talk about having you do a daily hour show.
[01:41:20.683 --> 01:41:24.984]  I'm thinking about Knight doing a daily show, other people, but I got to get more crew to do that first.
[01:41:24.984 --> 01:41:28.925]  That's why it's important people support InfoWars, because you are just such a brain.
[01:41:28.925 --> 01:41:30.546]  Stay there and ride shotgun with us.
[01:41:30.546 --> 01:41:34.787]  David Knight, I know you've been chomping at the bit on vacation for a week with your lovely wife.
[01:41:34.787 --> 01:41:35.747]  You certainly deserved it.
[01:41:35.747 --> 01:41:40.828]  But before we get into the problems with Trump, I was just saying to you while he was talking, we're fighting for our lives.
[01:41:40.828 --> 01:41:41.228]  I don't know.
[01:42:06.032 --> 01:42:13.840]  I've been a bitch at every conservative all day long that we somehow had a blacklist before I was born that persecuted some communist writers.
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:18.505]  Now they're openly saying shut us all down with big fat smiles on their faces.
[01:42:19.226 --> 01:42:34.798]  Yeah, actually, Alex, you know, when we look at this, and it's not being critical of Trump, and I want to talk about some of the good stuff that I saw, because I was on vacation, I didn't really respond to some of the good things that Donald Trump said, but, you know, he had great picks for Department of Energy, for EPA, for Interior.
[01:42:34.798 --> 01:42:41.803]  He had, for EPA, he's got the guy who brags about the fact that he's a lead attorney in resisting overreaching EPA regulations.
[01:42:41.803 --> 01:42:43.144]  He's also against Gen 21.
[01:42:43.144 --> 01:42:46.046]  Yeah, and when you look at... Basically, it's like Alex Jones or David Knight.
[01:42:46.246 --> 01:43:03.224]  When you look at the Interior Department, and of course that's where the Bureau of Land Management, these people who have been shutting down all these people who have been miners and loggers and ranchers and have had property rights removed from them that are just as real as the property rights to the land that your house sits upon.
[01:43:03.624 --> 01:43:07.507]  And people can have multiple levels of property rights on public land.
[01:43:07.507 --> 01:43:14.231]  That doesn't mean that they're claiming ownership of it, but they do have, as property rights say, mining rights, or logging rights, or water rights, or whatever.
[01:43:14.231 --> 01:43:16.673]  And these can all happen at the same piece of land.
[01:43:16.673 --> 01:43:18.594]  But to see somebody for Interior Department,
[01:43:19.034 --> 01:43:31.660]  That Alex, her family came over as part of the Oregon Trail thing, they're pioneers, and then her family created a local stand there selling resources there in the Pacific Northwest.
[01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:34.682]  She worked on a small family business.
[01:43:34.682 --> 01:43:41.805]  Sure, Trump's putting somebody in that understands people on the land is a positive, reversing the 30-year program to run people off public land.
[01:43:42.065 --> 01:43:46.788]  When we look at that, those are great, we look at their background, we say that's a great deal.
[01:43:46.788 --> 01:43:51.231]  Now, when he puts up somebody like Rex Tillerson, I looked at it and I thought the optics were very bad.
[01:43:51.231 --> 01:43:54.274]  I thought some of the things that in his past were very suspicious.
[01:43:54.274 --> 01:44:02.840]  And it's not to criticize Trump, because remember what the Bible says, you know, the wounds of a friend are faithful, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful, okay?
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:04.501]  So he's got all these people in Washington.
[01:44:05.001 --> 01:44:10.665]  That are coming to him, the Washington establishment, and they're saying, oh you need to get this person, get that person.
[01:44:10.665 --> 01:44:18.051]  If he doesn't hear from the voters who agree with his agenda, who support him, these people, I've seen it happen with Reagan, I've seen it happen with Steve Jobs.
[01:44:18.051 --> 01:44:21.233]  But isn't Rex Tillerson better than Mitt Romney?
[01:44:22.196 --> 01:44:23.296]  I don't know.
[01:44:23.296 --> 01:44:26.657]  I don't know, because I've seen him say things about carbon taxes.
[01:44:26.657 --> 01:44:29.498]  Let me explain, and you made the point earlier.
[01:44:29.498 --> 01:44:32.398]  Tillerson was the main funder exposing it was a fraud.
[01:44:32.398 --> 01:44:34.079]  All the other oil companies were pushing it.
[01:44:34.079 --> 01:44:36.919]  They tried to remove him in 2006 as the chairmanship.
[01:44:36.919 --> 01:44:40.740]  He took Exxon Mobil, which really is Standard Oil, away from the Rockefellers.
[01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:47.882]  And then he just kind of, he was playing politics, but he just did lip service while I know behind the scenes they were exposing it.
[01:44:48.942 --> 01:44:51.845]  And so, I guarantee you, with Trump, he said, no, I'm against all this.
[01:44:51.845 --> 01:44:54.888]  Now, if he gets in and goes for all that, I'm going to get mighty angry.
[01:44:54.888 --> 01:44:56.169]  But I get your point.
[01:44:56.169 --> 01:45:04.016]  Well, you know, when he went before the Council on Foreign Relations, when he testified before Congress, he was saying things like mocking the idea that we would have energy independence in the United States.
[01:45:04.016 --> 01:45:08.100]  That's a core thing for Donald Trump is to have energy independence.
[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:11.704]  He also said he thought a carbon tax is a way we would influence consumer decisions.
[01:45:11.704 --> 01:45:20.513]  I totally agree that since 2007 he made a deal, they still tried to remove him, he beat them, but he did join them at that point.
[01:45:20.513 --> 01:45:22.676]  So I think this has to be told.
[01:45:22.676 --> 01:45:28.722]  Well the other thing too is, and we understand that all this stuff about Russia is phony, but if you get somebody...
[01:45:29.503 --> 01:45:31.324]  They're announcing that he's going to go with somebody.
[01:45:31.324 --> 01:45:34.485]  This has given them ammunition to beat him about it.
[01:45:34.485 --> 01:45:39.667]  Guys, Google Rex Tillerson, Vladimir Putin, and it was him there in 2012, 2013.
[01:45:39.667 --> 01:45:43.048]  And you've got Marco Rubio now saying, well, I'm not going to vote to confirm him.
[01:45:43.048 --> 01:45:48.610]  All it takes is Marco Rubio and McCain, who is already saying, oh, the Russians are coming, the Russians are coming.
[01:45:48.610 --> 01:45:49.970]  And of course, Lindsey Graham.
[01:45:49.970 --> 01:45:53.331]  If just those three were to defect, that would hand Trump a defeat vote.
[01:45:53.331 --> 01:45:57.353]  No, no, but I mean, Tillerson drills all over Europe, all over Africa, all over Latin America, all over everywhere.
[01:45:57.893 --> 01:46:01.294]  I mean, again, are we not supposed to deal with Russia?
[01:46:01.294 --> 01:46:06.175]  He's bad because he tried to get Exxon into areas other people couldn't get into to drill?
[01:46:06.175 --> 01:46:07.395]  I mean, it's free market!
[01:46:07.395 --> 01:46:18.157]  Yeah, absolutely, but... I mean, listen, let's say if I went to Russia sightseeing, or let's say I went to Russia in five years to do some organic food deal, because they said that's going to be their big business.
[01:46:18.157 --> 01:46:23.058]  If I went there to sign a contract to buy, say, organic blueberries or something, would I be a Russian agent?
[01:46:23.058 --> 01:46:23.918]  Would I do business with the Russians?
[01:46:24.378 --> 01:46:27.839]  No, I'm just saying that if you've got somebody who has testified... I mean, I buy a lot of crap from China.
[01:46:27.839 --> 01:46:28.999]  I buy nothing from Russia.
[01:46:28.999 --> 01:46:35.901]  I mean, our listeners, we go, here's a radio made in China that costs $20, or the same radio made in America that costs $80.
[01:46:35.901 --> 01:46:37.241]  They choose to buy the one made in China.
[01:46:37.241 --> 01:46:38.701]  We sell some stuff made in China.
[01:46:38.701 --> 01:46:43.963]  We try not to, but because I'm buying shortwave radios from China, does that mean I'm a Chinese agent?
[01:46:43.963 --> 01:46:44.683]  No, I can't stand them.
[01:46:45.163 --> 01:46:51.637]  No, but if you've got somebody who has advocated for carbon taxes as a way to keep nations accountable, the question is accountable to who?
[01:46:57.876 --> 01:47:00.939]  What do you make of them trying to overthrow the election?
[01:47:00.939 --> 01:47:09.046]  I warned Trump, I warned other people, let's just say high up, I warned everybody.
[01:47:09.046 --> 01:47:11.889]  Well Alex, this is in the mix a year ago when Drudge came here.
[01:47:11.889 --> 01:47:15.892]  He knew that they were going to move against alternative, if you want to call it alternative, whatever, the true media.
[01:47:15.892 --> 01:47:20.016]  Oh yeah, Hillary said six months ago, we're going to take out the alternative media once I get in.
[01:47:20.196 --> 01:47:20.676]  That's right.
[01:47:20.676 --> 01:47:22.756]  And she was already calling you out by name.
[01:47:22.756 --> 01:47:26.617]  I don't think this is something that originated because Donald Trump won the election.
[01:47:26.617 --> 01:47:32.358]  I think they have to now pull Trump in and make him the brunt of this before they can move to us.
[01:47:32.358 --> 01:47:34.379]  But I think this has been their plan all along.
[01:47:34.379 --> 01:47:38.039]  Why isn't anybody talking about Hillary's leak of intelligence to the Russians?
[01:47:38.039 --> 01:47:45.221]  Why isn't anybody talking about how she corrupted the Democrat elections that we now see as being exposed by these leaks?
[01:47:45.221 --> 01:47:47.461]  Let me ask you that question and then back to Michael Snyder.
[01:47:48.081 --> 01:47:50.122]  How do we get on... Let's go to Snyder.
[01:47:50.122 --> 01:47:51.183]  How do we get on the offense?
[01:47:51.183 --> 01:47:56.145]  I mean, she's the one in the emails hacking the election, stealing things, manipulating.
[01:47:56.145 --> 01:47:58.046]  Trump got a bunch of new votes and recounts.
[01:47:58.046 --> 01:48:00.508]  He needs to get aggressive and say what David Knight was just saying.
[01:48:00.508 --> 01:48:03.549]  He needs to... I know he's trying to look magnanimous and presidential.
[01:48:03.549 --> 01:48:04.770]  Hey, they're not acting like that.
[01:48:04.770 --> 01:48:06.931]  They're a pack of rats at the gates.
[01:48:06.931 --> 01:48:08.692]  And look, I'm not an authoritarian.
[01:48:08.692 --> 01:48:10.713]  These are anti-American foreign globalists.
[01:48:11.053 --> 01:48:12.635]  I'm sick of the espionage.
[01:48:12.635 --> 01:48:21.085]  I mean, Putin, I'm not singing his praises, but he kicked out thousands of NGOs, funded by Soros and the State Department, trying to overthrow the Russian government.
[01:48:21.085 --> 01:48:27.492]  These foreign groups have no right to be here doing this, and now they're claiming we're foreign assets, when they're the foreign assets.
[01:48:27.492 --> 01:48:28.213]  What do we do, Snyder?
[01:48:29.389 --> 01:48:32.011]  Yeah, well, first of all, people need to wake up.
[01:48:32.011 --> 01:48:34.572]  People have relaxed since Donald Trump was elected.
[01:48:34.572 --> 01:48:36.353]  They think, oh, we won the war.
[01:48:36.353 --> 01:48:37.214]  We can relax.
[01:48:37.214 --> 01:48:38.514]  We don't need to prepare anymore.
[01:48:38.514 --> 01:48:40.856]  We don't have to be involved in the information war.
[01:48:40.856 --> 01:48:43.217]  Things are going to be great now that Trump is in.
[01:48:43.217 --> 01:48:43.677]  Exactly.
[01:48:43.677 --> 01:48:46.219]  We need to realize this is all out war.
[01:48:46.519 --> 01:48:53.621]  And by the way, by the way, I'm not up here ringing the alarm bell because, oh my gosh, we had 85 million viewers at the beginning of the election and now it's only 40 million.
[01:48:53.621 --> 01:48:54.422]  I could care less.
[01:48:54.422 --> 01:48:55.762]  I want to go on vacation.
[01:48:55.762 --> 01:49:00.504]  I had a vacation set, you know, to do a bunch of rock climbing and mountaineering in early January.
[01:49:00.504 --> 01:49:01.564]  I'm looking at cancelling it.
[01:49:01.564 --> 01:49:03.625]  In fact, I just told them I cancelled it.
[01:49:03.625 --> 01:49:04.645]  I'm sick of this.
[01:49:04.645 --> 01:49:06.346]  I'm tired of having to fight like this.
[01:49:06.346 --> 01:49:08.987]  But I'm telling you, we're in a maximum emergency.
[01:49:08.987 --> 01:49:11.248]  It's worse than it was five weeks ago.
[01:49:11.248 --> 01:49:12.148]  Sorry, Snyder, go ahead.
[01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:19.882]  Yeah, this has been the single most galvanizing moment for the establishment, for the New World Order that we've seen in generations.
[01:49:19.882 --> 01:49:21.562]  So they're in full-blown panic mode.
[01:49:21.562 --> 01:49:23.103]  They're declared all-out war.
[01:49:23.103 --> 01:49:26.523]  And they've got basically a scorched earth policy at this point.
[01:49:26.523 --> 01:49:27.944]  David Knight was exactly correct.
[01:49:27.944 --> 01:49:32.345]  They're going to start with Donald Trump, scorched earth, try to destroy him.
[01:49:32.345 --> 01:49:35.366]  Then they're coming for us because they think we put him in.
[01:49:35.366 --> 01:49:39.887]  And so they're going to come after us with scorched earth policy, try to destroy us.
[01:49:40.347 --> 01:49:41.127]  I want to get David's take on it.
[01:49:41.127 --> 01:49:41.768]  Exactly.
[01:49:41.768 --> 01:49:43.048]  And that's what I'm saying.
[01:49:43.048 --> 01:49:44.729]  Trump's gone sideways in a few areas.
[01:49:44.729 --> 01:49:46.870]  He's delivering them on policy and rhetoric.
[01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:47.930]  We'll see what happens.
[01:49:47.930 --> 01:49:55.133]  All I'm saying is, yeah, we'll spend 5% of our time, 10%, trying to keep his feet to the fire and watching, but we're all under attack now.
[01:49:55.133 --> 01:49:58.274]  All I'm saying is, all hands on deck, we've got to get him in office.
[01:49:58.274 --> 01:49:59.655]  Then, then we can deal with Trump.
[01:49:59.935 --> 01:50:07.922]  Yeah, if we go back to sleep now, if we rest on our laurels and say, okay, Trump got elected, he knows what he's doing, let's just let him handle all this stuff.
[01:50:07.922 --> 01:50:10.465]  No, the people who elected him have to get involved.
[01:50:10.465 --> 01:50:15.149]  I think that's part of the genius, I've never seen this before, of Donald Trump going around doing victory tours.
[01:50:15.149 --> 01:50:17.111]  He needs to keep the public engaged.
[01:50:17.111 --> 01:50:22.296]  Ronald Reagan always said he was going to go over the heads of the Congress and the heads of Washington and go directly to the people.
[01:50:22.296 --> 01:50:24.378]  Donald Trump is the one who's really done that.
[01:50:24.378 --> 01:50:24.758]  That's right.
[01:50:25.899 --> 01:50:26.179]  I think so.
[01:50:41.101 --> 01:50:42.302]  A laser beam.
[01:50:42.302 --> 01:50:47.387]  We all have to now re-energize and remember that feeling of victory, how good it is.
[01:50:47.387 --> 01:50:48.928]  But we've got to continue on.
[01:50:48.928 --> 01:50:51.350]  It's the animating contest of liberty.
[01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:53.452]  I can just feel it flowing through me.
[01:50:53.452 --> 01:50:55.614]  We'll be back with Michael Snyder for two more segments.
[01:50:55.614 --> 01:50:59.878]  The David Knight is going to ride shotgun with me some more with Wayne Madsen with Big Breaking News.
[01:50:59.878 --> 01:51:01.639]  KD Armor raised the standard.
[01:51:01.639 --> 01:51:02.740]  Finally, AR500 steel core body armor.
[01:51:04.482 --> 01:51:07.124]  That comfortably conforms to the chest and torso.
[01:51:07.124 --> 01:51:08.825]  Unique design distributes weight.
[01:51:08.825 --> 01:51:12.388]  Feeling lighter increases mobility and lessens fatigue.
[01:51:12.388 --> 01:51:15.491]  Introducing the Combat Quad Bend CQB.
[01:51:15.491 --> 01:51:19.134]  A revolutionary plate forming process that caters to the end user.
[01:51:19.134 --> 01:51:21.656]  The CQB is an industry game changer.
[01:51:21.656 --> 01:51:23.317]  A must-have for the ladies.

[01:51:26.139 --> 01:51:28.001]  C-A-T-I-R-M-O-R.com.

[01:51:29.999 --> 01:51:30.840]  Maybe not today.
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:32.520]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:36.282]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:51:36.282 --> 01:51:37.363]  Forget bunkers.
[01:51:37.363 --> 01:51:39.184]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:51:39.184 --> 01:51:40.884]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:51:59.625 --> 01:52:00.345]  Reality check.
[01:52:29.275 --> 01:52:36.037]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[01:52:36.037 --> 01:52:40.318]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.
[01:52:40.318 --> 01:52:44.939]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size.

[01:52:50.521 --> 01:52:50.621]  877-886-3653.
[01:52:50.621 --> 01:52:50.961]  GoBerkey.com.
[01:52:59.653 --> 01:53:00.313]  Hello again.
[01:53:00.313 --> 01:53:01.334]  My name is Gary Clark.
[01:53:01.334 --> 01:53:07.917]  I'm the actor who's turning 80 in August who played the part of Steve on the 1960s Western TV series, The Virginian.
[01:53:07.917 --> 01:53:12.859]  Now those of you who've suffered the side effects of prescribed medicines know what I'm talking about.
[01:53:12.859 --> 01:53:18.942]  And those of you who have watched the devastating effects that worrying about you has had on your loved ones,
[01:53:19.382 --> 01:53:22.203]  And what I shared a few months ago is only part of the story.
[01:53:22.203 --> 01:53:27.026]  I neglected to mention how One World Whey Protein Powder has affected my life.
[01:53:27.026 --> 01:53:31.308]  Now, I realize this is not dinner table conversation, but here goes anyway.
[01:53:31.308 --> 01:53:34.109]  One World Whey solved my irregularity.
[01:53:34.109 --> 01:53:38.651]  I've been plagued with constipation for years, and I thought it would be that way for the rest of my life.
[01:53:38.651 --> 01:53:42.233]  Three weeks on One World Whey set me on a new path.
[01:53:42.233 --> 01:53:45.634]  That was five months ago, and I haven't been irregular since.
[01:53:45.634 --> 01:53:47.015]  Will it work the same way for you?
[01:53:47.015 --> 01:53:47.876]  I don't know.
[01:53:47.876 --> 01:53:48.636]  It worked for me.
[01:53:49.036 --> 01:53:51.942]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[01:53:51.942 --> 01:53:54.287]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[01:54:07.688 --> 01:54:18.031]  I can tell you, looking at the CIA out officially demonizing, without showing the proof, Trump and being influenced by Russians, that green lights them under COG to create a hit team to take him out.
[01:54:18.031 --> 01:54:25.274]  And I'm gonna tell you right now, with all the newspapers calling for his death, and the Secret Service not allowed to do anything, you better believe, of course they're looking at killing him.
[01:54:25.274 --> 01:54:26.954]  They kill foreign leaders all the time.
[01:54:26.954 --> 01:54:28.095]  I came, I saw, he died.
[01:54:29.062 --> 01:54:34.404]  So I want to briefly talk about that with both of you and then coming to the next segment I want to talk more about solutions too.
[01:54:34.404 --> 01:54:43.308]  But the answer is communicating directly with Trump via the media and privately as well and just saying they're coming after you.
[01:54:43.308 --> 01:54:44.189]  My gut's never wrong.
[01:54:45.069 --> 01:54:46.410]  And they're never going to make deals.
[01:54:46.410 --> 01:54:47.411]  They're never going to back off.
[01:54:47.411 --> 01:54:50.133]  They want this country under their control.
[01:54:50.133 --> 01:54:55.497]  Please don't forget, listeners, we're trying to expand this operation, hire more reporters and get more crew.
[01:54:55.497 --> 01:54:56.298]  I don't want to do that.
[01:54:56.298 --> 01:54:57.459]  It's my job.
[01:54:57.459 --> 01:54:59.340]  I have to do it because it's my duty.
[01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:01.562]  I mean, I work seven days a week now, and I love it.
[01:55:01.562 --> 01:55:04.264]  I cannot stop thinking about work because it's the fight of our lives.
[01:55:04.264 --> 01:55:05.185]  It's history.
[01:55:05.185 --> 01:55:09.068]  All the products at Infoworkstore.com, thousands of them, are right now.
[01:55:09.588 --> 01:55:16.171]  Free shipping and as much as 50% off on things like colloidal silver that is so important to stock up on, living defense and more.
[01:55:16.171 --> 01:55:20.473]  EconomicCollapseBlog.com, Michael Schneider, David Knight riding shotgun with us into the next hour.
[01:55:20.473 --> 01:55:23.194]  Michael, thanks for letting us jump in and co-host with us.
[01:55:23.194 --> 01:55:25.655]  Other issues you want to address?
[01:55:25.655 --> 01:55:26.695]  Other points?
[01:55:26.695 --> 01:55:29.497]  I mean, you obviously agree Trump's got to get on the offense.
[01:55:29.497 --> 01:55:30.277]  What else does he do?
[01:55:31.601 --> 01:55:35.866]  Well, if I was in Donald Trump's position, I'll tell you exactly what I would do if I was Donald Trump.
[01:55:35.866 --> 01:55:46.958]  I would not appear in public until at least January 20th, Inauguration Day, because as you said, you know, him and his potentially his family are potentially in danger.
[01:55:47.458 --> 01:55:48.099]  Physically.
[01:55:48.099 --> 01:55:54.906]  Now, the New World Order would prefer to do this politically or legally if they can block him from becoming president.
[01:55:54.906 --> 01:55:59.371]  But, as I've always said, they'll move heaven and earth to try to prevent him from becoming president.
[01:55:59.371 --> 01:56:02.394]  Once he becomes president, of course, they'll try to do whatever they can to remove him.
[01:56:02.834 --> 01:56:05.595]  So Donald Trump needs to realize that he is in danger.
[01:56:05.595 --> 01:56:11.298]  This is a critical moment in American history and the hopes and dreams of so many are centered on him.
[01:56:11.298 --> 01:56:12.959]  Because it's not just the White House.
[01:56:12.959 --> 01:56:21.543]  As David Knight brought up earlier, you know, you've got the EPA, you've got the BATF, you've got all these agencies and the new world order advances their agenda.
[01:56:21.543 --> 01:56:23.284]  And globalism is in trouble.
[01:56:23.684 --> 01:56:27.947]  Look at the Italians last week voting to stop EU expansion.
[01:56:27.947 --> 01:56:29.308]  Beautiful things are happening.
[01:56:29.308 --> 01:56:30.429]  And what did the media say?
[01:56:30.429 --> 01:56:31.550]  They're Russian agents.
[01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:36.214]  Did you see the news where they're now, Merkel says Russians are why she's losing?
[01:56:36.214 --> 01:56:39.296]  Oh yeah, everything is Russia's fault all of a sudden.
[01:56:39.296 --> 01:56:50.945]  But really it's the new world order that's freaking out because Donald Trump, unlike other Republican presidents who come in and the game continues and the same people stay running the agencies and advancing the agenda.
[01:56:50.945 --> 01:56:51.706]  No, he's putting new people in.
[01:56:52.631 --> 01:56:59.475]  Yeah, he's going to clean house and all these agencies, but those are the instruments that they use to impose their agenda on all of us.
[01:56:59.475 --> 01:57:03.618]  People need to realize it's government agencies that are extremely powerful.
[01:57:03.618 --> 01:57:07.120]  Sure, let me bring up one more point, and it goes to yourexpertiseeconomiccollapseblog.com.
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:08.261]  I want to ask David this when we come back.
[01:57:09.531 --> 01:57:11.973]  Obviously Trump wants lower interest rates.
[01:57:11.973 --> 01:57:16.056]  I always said raise them moderately because I've talked to a lot of different economists, you want to be in between.
[01:57:16.056 --> 01:57:24.843]  But clearly, Dan do we do, Dan do we don't with QE Unlimited, they're talking about big rate increases now, admittedly to stall him and make it look like it's his fault.
[01:57:24.843 --> 01:57:26.384]  Do you think that'll work or what do you think is happening there?
[01:57:27.657 --> 01:57:31.800]  Oh yeah, you know, the Federal Reserve is already saying, well, we've got to raise interest rates in December.
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:33.120]  We have no choice.
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:37.243]  Well, they've had it on hold all this time because they want to help Hillary get in.
[01:57:37.243 --> 01:57:39.785]  So they didn't raise interest rates throughout the entire year.
[01:57:39.785 --> 01:57:42.146]  Now they said, we have to raise rates.
[01:57:42.146 --> 01:57:43.347]  You never raise them in December.
[01:57:43.347 --> 01:57:44.688]  They always do it in January or February.
[01:57:44.688 --> 01:57:46.109]  That's unprecedented, right, David?
[01:57:46.109 --> 01:57:46.629]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:57:46.849 --> 01:57:47.669]  And that's what they want to do.
[01:57:47.669 --> 01:57:53.192]  They want to slow down the economy just as they wanted to pump it up for Obama and Hillary, as you all know.
[01:57:53.192 --> 01:57:55.333]  And people said that from the very beginning about the federalism.
[01:57:55.333 --> 01:57:55.973]  And Trump knows that.
[01:57:55.973 --> 01:57:57.474]  He's battling to get us jobs.
[01:57:57.474 --> 01:57:58.034]  Yeah.
[01:57:58.034 --> 01:58:00.055]  It's a political organization.
[01:58:00.055 --> 01:58:05.937]  And they feather their own nest and then they reward their friends and punish their enemies by manipulating the economy.
[01:58:05.937 --> 01:58:07.578]  That's why it's bad.
[01:58:07.578 --> 01:58:09.859]  And it's exactly what they're going to do.
[01:58:10.419 --> 01:58:11.100]  Yeah.
[01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:22.055]  This morning, one of my crew members, Pat Riley, was watching Vice News on HBO, or no, it was last night, he told me about it this morning, with his wife, and it was like a new Obama interview where he's talking about us.
[01:58:22.055 --> 01:58:27.082]  And he says, yeah, people really just stopped trusting mainstream altogether, so they went to anything that wasn't us.
[01:58:27.583 --> 01:58:29.364]  And I'm like, oh, see, he didn't call us fake news.
[01:58:29.364 --> 01:58:30.805]  It was in a discussion of fake news.
[01:58:30.805 --> 01:58:34.127]  He was actually honest and meant, no, we just don't trust you.
[01:58:34.127 --> 01:58:34.908]  We don't like you.
[01:58:34.908 --> 01:58:36.629]  Folks, spread the word about InfoWars.
[01:58:36.629 --> 01:58:37.350]  They hate us.
[01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:38.250]  You're having a big effect.
[01:58:38.250 --> 01:58:38.710]  I love you.
[01:58:38.710 --> 01:58:39.811]  I appreciate you.
[01:58:39.811 --> 01:58:41.392]  InfoWars.com.
[01:58:41.392 --> 01:58:42.873]  We're not fighting to lose this, folks.
[01:58:42.873 --> 01:58:44.274]  We're fighting to win.
[01:58:44.274 --> 01:58:45.515]  And we can do it!
[01:58:45.515 --> 01:58:46.836]  Join or die!
[01:58:49.744 --> 01:58:52.407]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[01:58:52.407 --> 01:58:54.569]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[01:58:54.569 --> 01:59:00.295]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house.
[01:59:00.295 --> 01:59:03.378]  Like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling.
[01:59:03.378 --> 01:59:05.901]  The best part though, you can take it with you.
[01:59:05.901 --> 01:59:06.622]  It's mobile.
[01:59:06.622 --> 01:59:11.307]  To jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[01:59:11.767 --> 01:59:15.489]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity.
[01:59:15.489 --> 01:59:18.910]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[01:59:18.910 --> 01:59:19.931]  A true innovation.
[01:59:19.931 --> 01:59:22.012]  I have never seen anything like this.
[01:59:22.012 --> 01:59:23.732]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[01:59:23.732 --> 01:59:26.253]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[01:59:26.253 --> 01:59:30.435]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[01:59:30.435 --> 01:59:32.536]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.
[01:59:32.536 --> 01:59:34.577]  That's privatepowergrid.com.

[01:59:39.159 --> 01:59:41.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:02.864 --> 02:00:06.447]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:00:06.447 --> 02:00:10.611]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:36.448 --> 02:00:38.231]  All right, Michael Schneider's our guest.
[02:00:38.231 --> 02:00:39.492]  Michael, we've been ranting here.
[02:00:39.492 --> 02:00:42.877]  You've got five minutes to finish up other points that you're focused on.
[02:00:44.747 --> 02:00:45.968]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:00:45.968 --> 02:00:59.016]  Let's talk about the other article you mentioned earlier in the show where a member of the parliament in Denmark, Ida Auken, you know, basically a member of the lead, the lead are telling us exactly what they plan to do if we allow them to do it.
[02:00:59.016 --> 02:01:08.642]  Well, she wrote an article which appeared on the official website of the World Economic Forum, basically saying what life would be like, she envisions what life would be like in 2030, only 14 years from now.
[02:01:10.123 --> 02:01:13.125]  And in the article, she says, oh, I don't have any possessions.
[02:01:13.125 --> 02:01:14.406]  I don't own a car.
[02:01:14.406 --> 02:01:15.567]  I don't own a house.
[02:01:15.567 --> 02:01:16.788]  I don't own any appliances.
[02:01:16.788 --> 02:01:18.549]  I don't own any clothes.
[02:01:18.549 --> 02:01:20.250]  I don't have any possessions at all.
[02:01:20.250 --> 02:01:23.352]  But everything is provided for me by the central government.
[02:01:23.352 --> 02:01:24.773]  I live in a planned economy.
[02:01:24.773 --> 02:01:26.394]  She doesn't have photos of her grandmother.
[02:01:26.394 --> 02:01:27.735]  They're on the cloud.
[02:01:27.735 --> 02:01:28.495]  They can be watched.
[02:01:28.495 --> 02:01:31.157]  She says her own mind is hooked into the matrix.
[02:01:31.157 --> 02:01:32.278]  She's controlled.
[02:01:32.278 --> 02:01:33.259]  It's so wonderful.
[02:01:33.259 --> 02:01:36.120]  In fact, since you mentioned this, let's have you back up.
[02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:37.521]  This is an evergreen story.
[02:01:37.521 --> 02:01:39.243]  Next week for a full hour on this.
[02:01:39.243 --> 02:01:39.903]  But keep going.
[02:01:40.924 --> 02:01:44.545]  Yeah, and basically saying, oh, I don't have any possessions, I don't have any privacy.
[02:01:44.545 --> 02:01:48.087]  But in the article she says, oh, but I've never been happier.
[02:01:48.087 --> 02:01:52.049]  And she says, oh, in the future, the people aren't going to have to work at all.
[02:01:52.049 --> 02:01:56.211]  It'll be done by robots and computers and artificial intelligence.
[02:01:56.211 --> 02:01:59.693]  And then if you want something, you just order it and it's delivered to you.
[02:01:59.693 --> 02:02:00.393]  And scroll down.
[02:02:00.393 --> 02:02:02.474]  This woman looks like a total cult member.
[02:02:02.474 --> 02:02:06.456]  But understand, she's the upper class technocrat, so she'll be controlling you.
[02:02:06.456 --> 02:02:07.297]  So she's all for it.
[02:02:07.972 --> 02:02:10.674]  It's nothing but socialism with a thin veneer of technology.
[02:02:10.674 --> 02:02:11.815]  Scroll down.
[02:02:11.815 --> 02:02:14.076]  Let me show how crazy this woman looks.
[02:02:14.076 --> 02:02:14.636]  Please continue.
[02:02:14.636 --> 02:02:15.557]  Yeah.
[02:02:15.557 --> 02:02:20.680]  And it's basically the equivalent of a member of our Congress saying this.
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:24.263]  You know, so this is somebody that has real political power in Denmark.
[02:02:24.263 --> 02:02:33.149]  But she's saying that basically she envisions a world of planned cities where we're tightly, in very tight communities where we all use public transit.
[02:02:33.149 --> 02:02:35.530]  And all she's saying is the public globalist plan.
[02:02:35.530 --> 02:02:36.691]  It's not like she's the presenter.
[02:02:37.757 --> 02:02:58.548]  Oh yeah, she didn't dream this up, but this is what they want, and they believe that they can create kind of this socialist utopia, where everything is pre-planned, and where, you know, when you graduate high school or college, your job assignment, your job is assigned to you, because everything is planned, everything is controlled, and it's a great green society.
[02:02:58.548 --> 02:03:06.913]  And they push it as grassroots with the Zeitgeist Movement, supported by the UN and the New York Times, and the head of that movement said that I would be put in a re-education camp.
[02:03:08.058 --> 02:03:11.961]  Yeah, because those that don't agree, that try to rebel against the system, well, they're the problem.
[02:03:11.961 --> 02:03:28.755]  They need to be re-educated, they need to be controlled, they need to be put away, whatever, because they want this wonderful... Well, she says we'll just be put into zones, which I told her by that movie, or that series of books, which turned into movies, you know, with the whole Mockingjay and the rest of it, Hunger Games, is the real globalist planet.
[02:03:28.755 --> 02:03:32.098]  She says we'll be wild, feral humans in her article.
[02:03:33.567 --> 02:04:02.386]  Yeah, because they see us as people who actually want liberty and freedom as a lower class of humanity, but they're going to evolve, and they're going to have this wonderful socialist dream, and it feeds into transhumanism, humans being connected with technology and robots and computers and everything else, become a different class of human, more evolved into this wonderful new world order, and those that don't want to participate, well, they're going to be put outside the city, put in zones, re-educated, whatever you want to say it.
[02:04:03.507 --> 02:04:15.233]  She's expressing what the global elite have wanted for decades, but she's saying, hey, we could have this by 2030 if the public will allow us to proceed toward this wonderful new normal.
[02:04:15.233 --> 02:04:15.954]  Incredible.
[02:04:15.954 --> 02:04:19.976]  And then they call us fake news when we do what the mainstream media won't do.
[02:04:19.976 --> 02:04:23.378]  We go to the World Economic Forum website and it's a frickin' nightmare.
[02:04:23.378 --> 02:04:28.721]  You know, you go on there and it's like, we want $100 trillion in new taxes paid to private banks every decade.
[02:04:29.341 --> 02:04:30.722]  We want to run your life.
[02:04:30.722 --> 02:04:32.303]  Your kids don't belong to you.
[02:04:32.303 --> 02:04:33.264]  We need Al-Qaeda.
[02:04:33.264 --> 02:04:36.626]  That was one headline from the Foreign Affairs CFR.
[02:04:36.626 --> 02:04:37.526]  Al-Qaeda's good.
[02:04:37.526 --> 02:04:38.047]  We need them.
[02:04:38.047 --> 02:04:41.369]  I mean, you know, what's crazy is they just act like we're idiots and aren't reading this.
[02:04:41.369 --> 02:04:42.750]  Michael Schneider, incredible job.
[02:04:42.750 --> 02:04:44.431]  You can get it on the collapseblog.com.
[02:04:44.431 --> 02:04:45.932]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:45.932 --> 02:04:46.812]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:46.812 --> 02:04:47.673]  Isn't he honored?
[02:04:47.673 --> 02:04:52.135]  He made the Washington Post ban list of risky agents.
[02:04:52.135 --> 02:04:54.617]  Da, da, comrade.
[02:04:54.617 --> 02:04:55.738]  We'll be back.
[02:04:55.738 --> 02:04:56.498]  Stay with us.
[02:04:56.498 --> 02:04:57.339]  Wayne Madsen coming up.
[02:04:59.648 --> 02:05:03.790]  A former Icelandic Minister of Interior is claiming that the U.S.
[02:05:03.790 --> 02:05:09.492]  sent FBI agents to frame Julian Assange during a goodwill mission to Iceland in 2011.
[02:05:09.492 --> 02:05:17.275]  Now this troubling report has come to light and it's reviewing how the Obama administration links that it will go to to framed Julian Assange.
[02:05:17.475 --> 02:05:18.977]  The minister says the U.S.
[02:05:18.977 --> 02:05:30.588]  sent, quote, a plane load of FBI agents to Iceland in June of 2011 to both frame WikiLeaks and Assange, according to this minister, who refused them any cooperation and asked them to leave the country immediately.
[02:05:30.588 --> 02:05:38.956]  He claims that the Obama administration implied to Iceland officials that they had knowledge of, quote, hackers wanting to destroy software systems in the country and offered help.
[02:05:39.156 --> 02:05:43.421]  Well, the Interior Minister, Mr. Johansson, said he became suspicious of the U.S.
[02:05:43.421 --> 02:05:47.004]  good intentions and said, quote, I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:05:59.443 --> 02:06:03.447]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[02:06:03.447 --> 02:06:04.608]  Charlie Daniels.
[02:06:04.608 --> 02:06:06.449]  He's always loved America.
[02:06:06.449 --> 02:06:08.271]  He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[02:06:08.271 --> 02:06:11.113]  Let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21.
[02:06:11.113 --> 02:06:15.277]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[02:06:15.277 --> 02:06:19.241]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collected.
[02:06:19.241 --> 02:06:21.122]  Well, you know what the next move's going to be, don't you?
[02:06:21.122 --> 02:06:22.243]  It's going to be coming after you guys.
[02:06:22.243 --> 02:06:22.423]  Oh, yeah.
[02:06:22.423 --> 02:06:25.166]  I tell you, it ain't going to sit well down my way.
[02:06:25.686 --> 02:06:26.667]  At all.
[02:06:26.667 --> 02:06:27.708]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[02:06:27.708 --> 02:06:29.930]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[02:06:29.930 --> 02:06:31.091]  It's time to ride, boys.
[02:06:31.091 --> 02:06:33.092]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[02:06:33.092 --> 02:06:39.077]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[02:06:39.077 --> 02:06:41.719]  Then beef was for supper.
[02:06:41.719 --> 02:06:42.780]  Revelation.
[02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:44.342]  Dawn of global government.
[02:06:44.342 --> 02:06:46.163]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[02:06:46.163 --> 02:06:47.724]  DVDs now available.
[02:06:47.724 --> 02:06:52.028]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin,
[02:06:54.709 --> 02:07:05.775]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:07:05.775 --> 02:07:08.957]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:07:08.957 --> 02:07:14.160]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:07:14.580 --> 02:07:20.703]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:07:20.703 --> 02:07:23.984]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:07:23.984 --> 02:07:25.645]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:07:25.645 --> 02:07:29.947]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:07:29.947 --> 02:07:30.907]  It's one of the most effective.
[02:07:30.947 --> 02:07:32.889]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:07:32.889 --> 02:07:34.570]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:07:34.570 --> 02:07:37.993]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:07:37.993 --> 02:07:40.595]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:07:40.595 --> 02:07:41.656]  It's in powder form.
[02:07:41.656 --> 02:07:44.538]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:07:44.538 --> 02:07:45.258]  I take this.
[02:07:45.258 --> 02:07:47.080]  This is the product that I take.
[02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:49.862]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[02:07:49.862 --> 02:07:50.663]  We fight the globals.
[02:07:50.663 --> 02:07:51.804]  We fight the new world order.
[02:07:51.804 --> 02:07:56.007]  Secure your DNA force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:08.109 --> 02:08:11.634]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:08:11.634 --> 02:08:15.801]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:19.620 --> 02:08:26.702]  Wayne Madsen, formerly the National Security Agency, is one of the top riders when it comes to cyber security, espionage, you name it.
[02:08:26.702 --> 02:08:28.982]  He just, so much stuff he talks about.
[02:08:28.982 --> 02:08:32.163]  When I was first interviewing him 20 years ago, I just couldn't believe it.
[02:08:32.163 --> 02:08:35.224]  Like, cell phones are tracking you, they're triangulating.
[02:08:35.224 --> 02:08:38.304]  That all came out later, how they use keyword software.
[02:08:38.304 --> 02:08:43.246]  He was the first guy I heard about a year ago when these WikiLeaks were coming out saying, this isn't Russians, this is American.
[02:08:43.246 --> 02:08:46.286]  Now, William Binney has gone so far on this show as to say, it is.
[02:08:46.286 --> 02:08:47.867]  And I said, you know who?
[02:08:47.867 --> 02:08:48.467]  And he said, look,
[02:08:49.247 --> 02:08:51.649]  You don't want to get SWAT team, let's not talk any further.
[02:08:51.649 --> 02:09:02.777]  Now we have the high-level British ambassador coming out, the one in Guardian, saying, look, he said this months ago, he said, look, I've been in D.C., I've met with the leaker, it's high-level, it's U.S.
[02:09:02.777 --> 02:09:14.646]  intelligence, it's a leak, not a hack, it's the Chinese that know how to break into stuff, the Russians are very, very small in their numbers compared to the Chinese, and he just went over the facts, that's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:09:16.001 --> 02:09:19.169]  But separate from this, I've never seen such authoritarianism.
[02:09:19.169 --> 02:09:23.399]  I mean, it's surreal to have Hillary demonize me and call me dark heart and Obama attack me.
[02:09:24.358 --> 02:09:34.467]  But to have Vice News yesterday on HBO attack me, with the President, to have NPR last week, basically every hour, now it's settled down some.
[02:09:34.467 --> 02:09:39.351]  I mean, we're talking thousands of newspapers last week, hundreds a day, with fake quotes.
[02:09:39.351 --> 02:09:46.257]  I'd say Hillary is responsible for thousands and thousands of children being murdered and chopped up and sold to sex slavery and raped.
[02:09:46.257 --> 02:09:50.741]  They edited it together and had me saying they were doing it at the bottom of a pizza place.
[02:09:52.475 --> 02:09:55.397]  And then cut out where I said Syria.
[02:09:55.397 --> 02:09:58.878]  Now ladies and gentlemen, this is going to next level.
[02:09:58.878 --> 02:10:03.181]  And by the way, I did talk about Podesta and these codes, but this is how they discredit.
[02:10:03.181 --> 02:10:05.462]  And they don't care anymore.
[02:10:05.462 --> 02:10:10.885]  So again, some fools out there go, oh great, Alex Jones, I'm not in trouble.
[02:10:10.885 --> 02:10:12.265]  This is all of us in trouble.
[02:10:12.265 --> 02:10:13.226]  They shut down free speech.
[02:10:14.955 --> 02:10:17.896]  If you think I'm in trouble getting all this traffic, because NPR is big.
[02:10:17.896 --> 02:10:19.497]  It's got 40 million listeners a week.
[02:10:19.497 --> 02:10:21.438]  We've had massive traffic.
[02:10:21.438 --> 02:10:22.639]  But we notice it's junk traffic.
[02:10:22.639 --> 02:10:26.060]  They're not really buying anything or supporting sponsors, which is fine with me.
[02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:27.481]  Most people don't want junk traffic.
[02:10:27.481 --> 02:10:28.802]  I'll take all of it.
[02:10:28.802 --> 02:10:31.903]  Because junk traffic is somebody I'm going to wake up.
[02:10:31.903 --> 02:10:34.865]  Statistically, it's a low number of liberals I'm going to wake up, but I don't care.
[02:10:36.101 --> 02:10:39.946]  Send them to me, but we're getting massive traffic from CNN, ABC, CBS.
[02:10:39.946 --> 02:10:41.889]  I mean, we're not just talking about CNN with low ratings or MSNBC.
[02:10:41.889 --> 02:10:47.536]  We're talking about ABC News, CBS News, NBC News.
[02:10:47.536 --> 02:10:53.104]  All the major nightly shows from Stephen Colbert to you name it are attacking us weekly now.
[02:10:54.226 --> 02:10:59.190]  And I'm not making it about us, but I'm telling you, they say they want thousands of sites shut down.
[02:10:59.190 --> 02:11:01.231]  They listed the guy we had on Michael Schneider earlier.
[02:11:01.231 --> 02:11:03.593]  I know Madsen's been in some of the reports.
[02:11:03.593 --> 02:11:06.375]  What they want is the licensed journalist.
[02:11:06.375 --> 02:11:07.956]  Well, this guy's got press club credentials.
[02:11:07.956 --> 02:11:08.937]  Well, they'll still go after him.
[02:11:10.433 --> 02:11:11.534]  This is massive.
[02:11:11.534 --> 02:11:12.735]  They want government control.
[02:11:12.735 --> 02:11:14.176]  So there's that issue.
[02:11:14.176 --> 02:11:16.797]  There's the factor trying to keep Trump from getting into office.
[02:11:16.797 --> 02:11:17.958]  All I'm saying is, let's wait.
[02:11:17.958 --> 02:11:18.799]  Let's get him in.
[02:11:18.799 --> 02:11:19.679]  Some appointments are good.
[02:11:19.679 --> 02:11:20.540]  Some are bad.
[02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:21.881]  The job's coming back as good.
[02:11:21.881 --> 02:11:23.262]  He's got them manned.
[02:11:23.262 --> 02:11:23.982]  That's my take.
[02:11:23.982 --> 02:11:24.623]  That's my view.
[02:11:24.623 --> 02:11:27.005]  David Knight's riding shotgun with us for most of the hour.
[02:11:27.005 --> 02:11:29.166]  He'll duck out for 10 minutes at the end, come back and host.
[02:11:29.166 --> 02:11:30.927]  The fourth hour, he just came back.
[02:11:30.927 --> 02:11:32.528]  We're going to Wayne Madsen in a moment.
[02:11:32.528 --> 02:11:34.670]  What are some of the areas you want to get into with Wayne Madsen?
[02:11:34.670 --> 02:11:35.851]  I wanted to get him on mainly
[02:11:36.994 --> 02:11:41.781]  About the CIA report they admit they won't give the facts they say it's secret.
[02:11:41.781 --> 02:11:52.455]  I've talked to our connections and yes I have connections with former high-level CIA and current and we have connections into the private security agencies that are even bigger because they nexus the 16 agencies.
[02:11:53.817 --> 02:11:54.877]  Booz Allen and others.
[02:11:54.877 --> 02:11:57.318]  I've talked to three people with connections to that.
[02:11:57.318 --> 02:11:58.359]  They've made the phone calls.
[02:11:58.359 --> 02:12:01.080]  They say, this is not the main CIA.
[02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:04.181]  That's why we've had clips of congressmen saying, who were anti-Trump by the way.
[02:12:04.181 --> 02:12:11.063]  I played the clip last hour where Congressman, which one is that?
[02:12:11.063 --> 02:12:14.785]  Congressman Eliot Engel of New York said, no, they won't give us the facts.
[02:12:14.785 --> 02:12:16.065]  They won't show it to us.
[02:12:16.065 --> 02:12:18.106]  So quote, I want hearings so I can see it.
[02:12:18.766 --> 02:12:20.287]  So, this is so asinine.
[02:12:20.287 --> 02:12:22.449]  We know it's Hillary trying to steal the election.
[02:12:22.449 --> 02:12:25.631]  Hillary that ordered the media through, I mean, Wikileaks exposed it.
[02:12:25.631 --> 02:12:29.093]  So, we'll get Madsen's breakdown, expert breakdown on that.
[02:12:29.093 --> 02:12:31.955]  Then we'll get his take on what he thinks we should do about it.
[02:12:31.955 --> 02:12:34.577]  So, we're going to be talking to him here in just a moment.
[02:12:34.577 --> 02:12:36.418]  TheWayneMadsenReport.com.
[02:12:36.418 --> 02:12:38.340]  He also reports for InfoWars.com.
[02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:39.641]  I'm inviting him again to come to D.C.
[02:12:39.641 --> 02:12:40.841]  I know he'll already be there.
[02:12:40.841 --> 02:12:44.204]  We're getting hotels and stuff to help us cover it during the inauguration.
[02:12:44.204 --> 02:12:45.625]  But will Trump make it?
[02:12:45.625 --> 02:12:47.126]  Because this is unprecedented.
[02:12:47.446 --> 02:12:52.932]  To have the CIA, not supposed to be involved in domestic operations, domestically doing this.
[02:12:52.932 --> 02:12:54.514]  What are some of the other points you want Wayne to get into?
[02:12:54.514 --> 02:13:02.724]  Well, I think it's very significant, Alex, that the CIA would come out and talk about this because they would not attack Trump if they didn't believe they could take him down.
[02:13:02.944 --> 02:13:15.155]  This is why Trump needs to take this very seriously and he needs to push back because we always understand that when this information comes out, whether it's coming from Snowden or WikiLeaks or somebody, they want to make them the focus, them the criminals.
[02:13:15.155 --> 02:13:25.325]  So when you expose the criminal actions of Hillary Clinton and you expose that she actually did rig the elections, we see that from the conspiracy between her and the press and the DNC.
[02:13:25.885 --> 02:13:28.709]  They don't want you to look at what she did to rig the elections.
[02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:30.132]  They don't want you to look at her crimes.
[02:13:30.132 --> 02:13:34.078]  They want to make the whistleblowers and the messengers the criminals and come after them.
[02:13:34.078 --> 02:13:36.181]  And that's what I told Trump four months ago.
[02:13:36.181 --> 02:13:38.444]  I said, they're trying to steal the nomination.
[02:13:38.444 --> 02:13:39.806]  You just got that.
[02:13:39.806 --> 02:13:41.469]  I said, I told him this personally.
[02:13:41.849 --> 02:13:43.872]  And I said, they're coming after you.
[02:13:43.872 --> 02:13:45.414]  They're going to try to steal the general.
[02:13:45.414 --> 02:13:46.716]  He said, I'm already on it.
[02:13:46.716 --> 02:13:47.638]  So he didn't do what I said.
[02:13:47.638 --> 02:13:49.160]  He said, Alex, I'm already on it.
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:51.343]  You'll be very pleased the next few days.
[02:13:51.343 --> 02:13:52.105]  Then he came out.
[02:13:52.105 --> 02:13:53.807]  It wasn't him listening to me.
[02:13:53.807 --> 02:13:55.570]  He totally agreed and understood it.
[02:13:55.570 --> 02:13:56.832]  Wayne Madsen, where do you want to start?
[02:13:56.832 --> 02:13:57.432]  There's a lot here.
[02:13:58.257 --> 02:14:08.303]  Well, you know, I've never seen so many so-called progressives singing the praises of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:14:08.303 --> 02:14:18.030]  In one case it's surprising, but in another it isn't, because I've just written a book called The Almost Classified Guide to CIA Front Companies, Proprietaries,
[02:14:18.630 --> 02:14:20.651]  And it was illegal then.
[02:14:20.651 --> 02:14:22.752]  They've now passed laws legalizing it.
[02:14:46.542 --> 02:14:52.264]  Yeah, now we're going to see the voice of America start to play a domestic propaganda role.
[02:14:52.264 --> 02:14:57.306]  But look, you know, Donald Trump's right.
[02:14:57.306 --> 02:15:04.669]  I'm surprised he knows enough about computer security to say, look, we don't know if this is China or Russia or some guy.
[02:15:04.669 --> 02:15:05.570]  I know he said a couple.
[02:15:05.930 --> 02:15:08.772]  I don't like Bolton, but he's saying this could be an Obama false flag.
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:25.101]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:15:25.101 --> 02:15:32.827]  So network weaving was always done by nefarious actors to make it look like it was the Russians or the Soviets.
[02:15:32.827 --> 02:15:38.571]  That's like a phone spoof where you program your phone to be somebody else's phone number and then call up and death threat the SWAT team.
[02:15:39.238 --> 02:15:58.202]  Right, so what they do this for is they, especially if they're breaking into bank accounts, they don't want to be subject to criminal investigation, it gets to the point where you can't follow those electronic breadcrumbs back any further because they get lost in this huge, complex, network-weaving operation.
[02:15:58.202 --> 02:16:01.983]  And I don't think the CIA is telling the truth.
[02:16:01.983 --> 02:16:07.184]  I think their secret report is like all the other phony intelligence they've come out with.
[02:16:08.204 --> 02:16:12.648]  I think there's not only a problem with fake news, there's a problem with fake intelligence.
[02:16:12.648 --> 02:16:15.691]  Well obviously most intelligence is fake.
[02:16:15.691 --> 02:16:18.893]  The CIA has cornered the market on fake intelligence.
[02:16:18.893 --> 02:16:24.258]  Remember Yellow Cake Uranium and weapons of mass destruction and all that nonsense.
[02:16:24.258 --> 02:16:36.481]  By the way, they knew those were British trucks sold in 1990 and 1989, more than 30 of them, to Saddam to pump up hot air balloons with cameras on them for artillery direction for the Iran-Iraq war.
[02:16:36.481 --> 02:16:38.261]  That had just ended, but they ordered more trucks.
[02:16:38.261 --> 02:16:43.562]  They knew in the specs in Jane's Weapons Quarterly what the trucks were, but they lied and said it was anthrax trucks.
[02:16:43.562 --> 02:16:45.203]  But let me just get back to this then.
[02:16:45.203 --> 02:16:51.004]  We get so close to a problem that as we stare into the abyss, we become, you know, kind of comfortable with it, to paraphrase Nietzsche.
[02:16:52.017 --> 02:17:02.065]  I mean, I don't think I've ever seen something since the Kennedy assassination, this epic, where the CIA is openly involved domestically, the media is lockstep saying Trump's a Russian agent.
[02:17:02.065 --> 02:17:06.608]  They actually say, Tucker Carlson, this congressman said Thursday, you're a Russian agent.
[02:17:06.608 --> 02:17:09.630]  I mean, this is so laughable, but they're doing it.
[02:17:09.630 --> 02:17:11.011]  They're serious.
[02:17:11.011 --> 02:17:13.113]  They're trying to get delegates to go against Trump.
[02:17:13.113 --> 02:17:16.075]  More saying, you watch, he's not getting in.
[02:17:16.075 --> 02:17:19.378]  I think they're triggering COG, and I think Obama's got on his desk.
[02:17:19.958 --> 02:17:22.879]  I'm sure they floated it to him with the media promoting assassination.
[02:17:22.879 --> 02:17:24.960]  I think they're looking at actually killing Trump.
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:39.125]  I talked to Wayne right after the election, Alex, and we talked about the color revolutions of Soros and the fact that they have always had the goal of delegitimizing an election and then painting the one who won it as a foreign agent and authoritarian.
[02:17:39.125 --> 02:17:43.047]  And he even talked about how it was a purple revolution when Hillary came out with her purple clothes.
[02:17:43.047 --> 02:17:43.687]  What does this tell you?
[02:17:43.687 --> 02:17:44.607]  I want to ask Wayne this.
[02:17:44.607 --> 02:17:45.348]  What does this tell you?
[02:17:45.348 --> 02:17:48.029]  I want to get back to them assassinating Trump because I think that's really on the front burner now.
[02:17:49.093 --> 02:18:00.423]  We're sitting here, we're looking at this, and as you said they wouldn't be putting all this out if they didn't think they could unseat him.
[02:18:00.423 --> 02:18:05.147]  And as soon as they lost November 8th, two days later, Soros gave
[02:18:05.988 --> 02:18:14.954]  Several hundred million more to Black Lives Matter, a couple hundred million more to a Ford Foundation initiative, and a bunch of corporations lined up and gave a million, two million, Kellogg's did.
[02:18:14.954 --> 02:18:22.379]  They gave hundreds of millions, so we're talking close to a billion bucks has been given to destabilize, double the money they got the last year in an election.
[02:18:22.719 --> 02:18:24.981]  So they're not backing off on destabilization.
[02:18:24.981 --> 02:18:28.125]  That was a real marker that they're getting ready for civil war.
[02:18:28.125 --> 02:18:32.729]  Then CNN comes out yesterday and says, we're going into a national emergency.
[02:18:32.729 --> 02:18:34.191]  Get ready, it's Trump's fault.
[02:18:34.191 --> 02:18:35.632]  So, Wayne, let's tackle both.
[02:18:35.632 --> 02:18:39.917]  The national emergency, the assassination issue, and what all this signifies.
[02:18:39.917 --> 02:18:45.562]  Because, I mean, in your 40 years as a journalist, before that you were in the Navy and in the NSA, have you ever
[02:18:46.283 --> 02:18:51.950]  Has your spidey sense or your gut, or maybe you think I'm wrong, maybe this isn't a critical time.
[02:18:51.950 --> 02:18:54.213]  I mean, what time in history are we standing right now?
[02:18:55.291 --> 02:18:55.351]  I'm
[02:19:26.532 --> 02:19:32.497]  And they usually kill somebody or false flag them.
[02:19:32.497 --> 02:19:33.318]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:19:33.318 --> 02:19:36.861]  They wouldn't be arrogantly up on their hind legs if they weren't moving.
[02:19:36.861 --> 02:19:37.522]  That's right.
[02:19:37.522 --> 02:19:42.246]  And look, you've got John Brennan as the CIA director still.
[02:19:42.246 --> 02:19:43.687]  Look, this guy's bad news.
[02:19:43.687 --> 02:19:44.968]  Saudi operative.
[02:19:44.968 --> 02:19:48.911]  Yeah, he's representing Saudi Arabia and the Islamic State.
[02:19:48.911 --> 02:19:52.535]  General Flynn called him out on that and that's why they're going after Flynn.
[02:19:53.075 --> 02:20:00.998]  Look, the story, they're trying to say that Flynn, General Flynn, had a private email server at his office in the Pentagon.
[02:20:00.998 --> 02:20:07.040]  Anyone who knows Washington knows that the DIA Director's office isn't in the Pentagon.
[02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:12.782]  It's at DIA headquarters at Bowling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., across the Potomac River.
[02:20:13.982 --> 02:20:23.237]  They're calling him Crazy Flynn when he's known as one of the smartest, one of the best guys ever reorganizing things, and they're saying, I saw all these articles going, he's crazy!
[02:20:23.237 --> 02:20:24.940]  He claims Hillary funded ISIS!
[02:20:24.940 --> 02:20:26.061]  It's on record they did!
[02:20:26.820 --> 02:20:36.992]  Yeah, well, if the Huffington Post can't get a basic fact like that right, where is the office of the director, the DIA director, Defense Intelligence Agency?
[02:20:36.992 --> 02:20:41.617]  If they don't know that's at Bowling Air Force Base, what else are they getting wrong?
[02:20:41.617 --> 02:20:42.998]  They're getting a lot wrong.
[02:20:42.998 --> 02:20:47.423]  So, you know, fake news, you know, is it fake news or it's just...
[02:20:48.124 --> 02:20:50.045]  It's not good news gathering.
[02:20:50.045 --> 02:20:52.227]  They just make up whatever they want.
[02:20:52.227 --> 02:20:56.089]  So getting back to assassination, do you see it in the cards?
[02:20:56.089 --> 02:20:58.731]  Because I see everything they're doing shows they've committed.
[02:20:58.731 --> 02:21:01.332]  They're going to try to stop him getting into office.
[02:21:01.332 --> 02:21:02.553]  Yeah, that's why.
[02:21:02.553 --> 02:21:06.015]  I mean, yeah, it's bothering me.
[02:21:06.015 --> 02:21:09.778]  I got to give Trump credit for taking on the CIA.
[02:21:09.778 --> 02:21:11.979]  It's like for me, it's a dream come true.
[02:21:11.979 --> 02:21:13.660]  I always wish somebody would.
[02:21:13.660 --> 02:21:15.822]  Now, look, Obama is a product of the CIA.
[02:21:16.442 --> 02:21:34.888]  Let me say this, let me ask this, did you notice they said six months ago or about five months ago right when he won the nomination they said oh we don't want to give him intelligence briefings he said I don't want those fake things from the CIA I wouldn't believe a word of that I have my sources I now know from multiple sources he has high-level Booz Allen analysis that could become a whole other issue how he was getting that
[02:21:35.568 --> 02:21:39.869]  Uh, and has been getting really good intel all along and knows what's going on.
[02:21:39.869 --> 02:21:44.171]  If you look at Booz Allen, whether you like it or not, they get to fuse the 16 agencies' info.
[02:21:44.171 --> 02:21:46.071]  They're not just looking at one agency.
[02:21:46.071 --> 02:21:50.733]  So when they're saying that, you know, if we get hit by terrorists, he didn't get his briefings, it's his fault.
[02:21:50.733 --> 02:21:53.454]  No, it's not, because he certainly is on top of things.
[02:21:53.454 --> 02:21:56.855]  How astute does it show that he doesn't even want CIA briefings?
[02:21:57.355 --> 02:22:06.302]  Because I think one reason, you know, on Wall Street there are risk analysis firms who provide Wall Street with much better intelligence.
[02:22:06.302 --> 02:22:13.467]  Because they're making decisions on Wall Street that could mean billions and trillions of dollars if they don't have proper... Exactly.
[02:22:13.467 --> 02:22:18.391]  The CIA is a bunch of political, you know, Ivy League people that Trump can't stand.
[02:22:18.973 --> 02:22:21.055]  They cooked the books on intelligence.
[02:22:21.055 --> 02:22:21.856]  We know they did it.
[02:22:21.856 --> 02:22:24.598]  We know Cheney did it on Iraq.
[02:22:24.598 --> 02:22:27.561]  And look, I think he's right.
[02:22:27.561 --> 02:22:36.889]  Look, Kennedy, even he didn't trust the CIA intelligence because they were trying to lead him into a nuclear war with the Soviet Union at the time.
[02:22:36.889 --> 02:22:39.071]  So we've been here before with this.
[02:22:39.071 --> 02:22:40.512]  Reagan, when Reagan was president...
[02:22:41.812 --> 02:22:47.158]  Yeah, Gates, Bob Gates was feeding Reagan false information about Soviets.
[02:22:47.158 --> 02:22:50.361]  But at least back then the Soviets were corrupt and doing bad stuff.
[02:22:50.361 --> 02:22:53.205]  They're trying to reform while we're going the way of the Soviet Union.
[02:22:53.205 --> 02:23:01.394]  I mean, how can they ever accuse Putin of trying to censor press when there's not real evidence of it, when they're openly saying, shut us up, by name, all over the place, Wayne?
[02:23:01.934 --> 02:23:09.698]  Yeah, they're trying to censor RT and Sputnik Radio over here, you know, because it's linked to the Russian government.
[02:23:09.698 --> 02:23:11.159]  Well, I'm going to ask you both this then.
[02:23:11.159 --> 02:23:14.341]  What does Trump do with 38 days out?
[02:23:14.341 --> 02:23:16.162]  Let's say I get a chance to talk to him the next few days.
[02:23:16.162 --> 02:23:18.363]  I'm talking to Trump for, say, 10 minutes.
[02:23:18.363 --> 02:23:19.584]  What do I say to the President?
[02:23:20.798 --> 02:23:22.941]  Stay on your ground.
[02:23:22.941 --> 02:23:25.403]  Don't be intimidated by the CIA.
[02:23:25.403 --> 02:23:29.988]  They've been running this country since 1947, since their inception.
[02:23:29.988 --> 02:23:31.470]  Kennedy tried to take them on.
[02:23:31.470 --> 02:23:33.392]  They killed them.
[02:23:33.392 --> 02:23:35.614]  And Carter tried to take them on.
[02:23:35.614 --> 02:23:41.080]  They eased them out of office with a hostage situation created by the CIA in Iran.
[02:23:41.581 --> 02:23:43.803]  So this is what he's facing.
[02:23:43.803 --> 02:23:54.172]  Reagan didn't trust these trilateral types and CFRs either, and a friend of the Bush family took a shot at him, you know, a few months after he was inaugurated.
[02:23:54.172 --> 02:23:58.496]  Sure, well Trump has backed off some, going after Hillary at least until he gets in, and
[02:24:00.057 --> 02:24:02.838]  All they're doing is attacking him from every angle, trying to bring him down.
[02:24:02.838 --> 02:24:06.580]  I mean, he's got to secure the Republic in our vote.
[02:24:06.580 --> 02:24:17.725]  If outside influences like Soros are moving against us and the Congress wants investigations of us and Trump, there should be real investigations of Soros and these leftist groups and Hillary trying to steal the election.
[02:24:17.725 --> 02:24:20.746]  Look, they're trying to overthrow our country and the First Amendment.
[02:24:20.746 --> 02:24:24.088]  At a certain point, we've got to go after these people criminally, David.
[02:24:24.528 --> 02:24:27.430]  Yeah, absolutely, Alex, and that's what we talked about right after the election.
[02:24:27.430 --> 02:24:33.816]  The fact that this follows a pattern that we've seen from George Soros again and again for regime change, his color revolutions.
[02:24:33.816 --> 02:24:38.700]  And it's about delegitimizing the election and demonizing the person that won the election.
[02:24:38.700 --> 02:24:40.201]  He needs to come out on the offensive.
[02:24:40.201 --> 02:24:42.303]  He needs to understand, first of all, they're very serious.
[02:24:42.303 --> 02:24:45.285]  They think they can get away with this or they would not be attacking the president.
[02:24:45.285 --> 02:24:47.707]  You don't go after the king unless you think you can kill him.
[02:24:47.807 --> 02:24:48.628]  How does he go offense?
[02:25:04.241 --> 02:25:05.381]  It's outrageous.
[02:25:05.381 --> 02:25:22.866]  My father, my company, what we do in America, what we've built, the great victory we've had, the list of jobs he's brought back, and then the CIA that gave you fake WMD info, and all the rest of it, comes out here and claims the Russians did this and that you're stupid, America, and you voted for me because of the Russians.
[02:25:22.866 --> 02:25:24.067]  And I'll tell you something else.
[02:25:24.067 --> 02:25:26.227]  Hillary had Jill Stein go out with this recount.
[02:25:26.227 --> 02:25:27.248]  The Democrats gave her money.
[02:25:27.248 --> 02:25:27.828]  She joined it.
[02:25:28.288 --> 02:25:31.470]  And they counted these states, and I got hundreds of thousands more votes.
[02:25:31.470 --> 02:25:35.413]  If we did that everywhere, you add it up, it'd be millions like I said.
[02:25:35.413 --> 02:25:37.034]  They've got the illegals voting.
[02:25:37.034 --> 02:25:38.595]  They think they run this country.
[02:25:38.595 --> 02:25:39.776]  They've run it in the ground.
[02:25:39.776 --> 02:25:40.616]  And you know what?
[02:25:40.616 --> 02:25:42.457]  What does the American people want me to do?
[02:25:42.457 --> 02:25:46.100]  They're trying to have the electors overthrow this and cause a civil war.
[02:25:46.100 --> 02:25:47.501]  What should we do?
[02:25:47.501 --> 02:25:48.641]  And then the people would say,
[02:25:49.662 --> 02:25:52.504]  Arrest their asses, because I am sick of this!
[02:25:52.504 --> 02:26:08.796]  And you notice that as soon as Jill Stein crashed and burned on this recount attempt, being shut down in two states by judges who had the good sense to say she doesn't have standing in this, she's got 1% or less of the vote, there's no reason that she should be the one calling for a recount.
[02:26:08.796 --> 02:26:11.658]  They're trying to cause a civil war, we gotta stop them!
[02:26:11.658 --> 02:26:12.399]  It's sedition!
[02:26:12.819 --> 02:26:18.844]  Listen, if I get up here and say the government's corrupt and out of control and they need to stop this policy, it's not because I hate America, it's I hate the criminals in government.
[02:26:18.844 --> 02:26:33.035]  We finally start getting a government that wants to restore the republic, bring back jobs, bring back transparency, do some decent stuff, and all these foreign powers and agencies are openly trying to overthrow it and cause a civil war, and they've given a billion dollars to cause a race war.
[02:26:33.035 --> 02:26:37.899]  We cannot sit here and let a James Bond villain plan be carried out against us.
[02:26:37.899 --> 02:26:38.660]  Sorry, go ahead, David.
[02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:40.220]  That's exactly it.
[02:26:40.220 --> 02:26:45.962]  In other countries, he's done it not on the basis of race, because they're homogeneous in terms of race.
[02:26:45.962 --> 02:26:50.643]  But they have a stratified, yeah, that's by religion or stratified based on income level.
[02:26:50.643 --> 02:26:52.063]  That's the way the communists did it.
[02:26:52.063 --> 02:26:54.344]  They broke everybody into these economic classes.
[02:26:54.344 --> 02:27:00.605]  Here, they didn't have that type of thing, so what they did was they went after racial division to try to create the basis for the revolution.
[02:27:00.985 --> 02:27:10.494]  But Alex, the key thing is that we've got to understand that this attack on the press was in the works going back to 2013 when they took away the prohibition of Voice of America coming into the United States.
[02:27:10.494 --> 02:27:11.995]  Oh, they've been cooking this up the whole time!
[02:27:11.995 --> 02:27:15.959]  Yeah, this is before Trump, and so this isn't anything as they're trying to portray it as a reaction to the election.
[02:27:15.959 --> 02:27:17.460]  And by the way, I want to tell the Dunnies out there something.
[02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:22.645]  There's so many people with blogs and sites that even follow our genre of awakening, and they think it's competition.
[02:27:22.645 --> 02:27:25.167]  They go, oh good, I hope Alex gets shut down, we'll be bigger.
[02:27:25.167 --> 02:27:25.647]  Hey Dunnies!
[02:27:26.528 --> 02:27:29.130]  They'll shut you down before they shut us down, that's how it works.
[02:27:29.130 --> 02:27:30.931]  They're getting the little people first.
[02:27:30.931 --> 02:27:32.953]  That's who Facebook, everybody's checking off.
[02:27:32.953 --> 02:27:38.677]  Believe me, if things get so bad the press is getting shut down, I'm just gonna evacuate.
[02:27:38.677 --> 02:27:40.939]  This isn't about Alex Jones, it's like Washington Times.
[02:27:40.939 --> 02:27:45.342]  Alex Jones begs Trump to save his website, now that folks are calling for it to be shut down.
[02:27:45.342 --> 02:27:51.807]  It's called a blacklist dummy, that's what I'm concerned about, not about them shutting me down individually.
[02:27:51.807 --> 02:27:53.829]  I'm sorry, go ahead my friend, go ahead Wayne Madsen.
[02:27:54.673 --> 02:28:02.235]  Well, look, I think one thing is I think Trump ought to go on the offensive rather than play defense on this.
[02:28:02.235 --> 02:28:11.417]  He should say, look, after I'm inaugurated, I'm going to name a blue ribbon commissioner panel to look at the CIA's blatant involvement before the election.
[02:28:11.417 --> 02:28:17.558]  People like these retired or former CIA directors, Michael Hayden, Mike Morrell, all
[02:28:17.938 --> 02:28:18.639]  Getting involved.
[02:28:18.639 --> 02:28:21.642]  This guy, Evan McMullin, former CIA clandestine.
[02:28:21.642 --> 02:28:23.684]  We're running against them.
[02:28:23.684 --> 02:28:26.147]  You know, I mean, who funded these operations?
[02:28:26.147 --> 02:28:30.672]  Oh, they have CIA field commanders running the stuff in Utah to try to get delegates.
[02:28:30.672 --> 02:28:32.474]  I mean, this is an operation.
[02:28:32.474 --> 02:28:32.834]  Right.
[02:28:32.834 --> 02:28:34.316]  He needs to say, look,
[02:28:36.338 --> 02:28:41.704]  I want to do what Eisenhower said when he warned us against the military-industrial complex.
[02:28:41.704 --> 02:28:43.205]  CIA was part of that.
[02:28:43.205 --> 02:28:46.228]  What Kennedy said he wanted to do, get rid of this agency.
[02:28:46.228 --> 02:28:53.616]  What Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Hillary's predecessor, a senator from New York, said, get rid of the CIA and get rid of all that.
[02:28:54.096 --> 02:28:55.057]  Exactly.
[02:28:55.057 --> 02:28:56.378]  It's over for the globalists.
[02:28:56.378 --> 02:29:06.385]  If we link up with Russia, unify around dealing with radical Islam, and create a free market bridge, and then get China contained and reformed, I'm telling you, it's peace, man!
[02:29:06.385 --> 02:29:07.886]  But the globalists don't want that, do they, Wayne?
[02:29:08.837 --> 02:29:13.582]  No, no, they want constant schisms.
[02:29:13.582 --> 02:29:15.303]  Hillary's still wearing a purple.
[02:29:15.303 --> 02:29:20.488]  I saw her at this farewell thing for Senator Reid.
[02:29:20.488 --> 02:29:23.751]  She looked like Barney the Dinosaur with a purple pantsuit on.
[02:29:24.652 --> 02:29:28.694]  Uh, you know, so she's still playing that purple revolution card.
[02:29:28.694 --> 02:29:30.255]  Uh, I think her days are over.
[02:29:30.255 --> 02:29:31.456]  She's history.
[02:29:31.456 --> 02:29:38.279]  But look, she's got plenty of accolades out there in Congress and in these NGOs and all these other groups.
[02:29:38.279 --> 02:29:39.220]  Let's talk about that.
[02:29:39.220 --> 02:29:42.261]  Let's talk about the way they're going to try to bring down Trump because they're certainly trying.
[02:29:42.261 --> 02:29:44.403]  As David said, you aim at the king to take him out.
[02:29:44.403 --> 02:29:45.083]  You better hit him.
[02:29:45.083 --> 02:29:46.604]  I mean, they're going all out.
[02:29:46.604 --> 02:29:47.424]  What do we expect?
[02:29:47.424 --> 02:29:48.645]  What can we do straight ahead?
[02:29:49.085 --> 02:29:53.009]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.009 --> 02:29:55.692]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.722 --> 02:30:03.545]  Why is the CIA pushing this ridiculous conspiracy theory?
[02:30:03.545 --> 02:30:09.748]  Reports of Russian officials intervening in the American presidential election have been industriously circulated for months.
[02:30:09.748 --> 02:30:18.774]  The FBI, DHS, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence are all looking at the same allegations, and all of the agencies came up with the same foregone conclusion.
[02:30:18.774 --> 02:30:22.957]  Vladimir Putin's government deliberately interfered with America's presidential election.
[02:30:23.117 --> 02:30:34.690]  The laughable insinuation was reiterated this morning in an article published in The Hill, attacking President-elect Donald Trump for casting doubt on their assessment, concluding that Russia intervened in the election to help him win the White House.
[02:30:34.690 --> 02:30:35.291]  Trump tweeted out,
[02:30:40.697 --> 02:30:46.803]  Keep in mind, this is the same CIA that asserted false claims against Saddam Hussein and led us into the invasion of Iraq.
[02:30:46.803 --> 02:30:53.830]  With a track record like that, one must take their assessments with a serious grain of salt and question the motivation of these agencies.
[02:30:53.830 --> 02:30:56.193]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:30:59.528 --> 02:31:07.796]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.

[02:31:55.047 --> 02:31:59.311]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:31:59.311 --> 02:32:01.954]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[02:32:01.954 --> 02:32:04.116]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[02:32:04.116 --> 02:32:09.861]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house.
[02:32:09.861 --> 02:32:12.464]  Like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling.
[02:32:12.944 --> 02:32:15.445]  The best part though, you can take it with you.
[02:32:15.445 --> 02:32:16.166]  It's mobile.
[02:32:16.166 --> 02:32:21.308]  To jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18 wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[02:32:21.308 --> 02:32:25.050]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity.
[02:32:25.050 --> 02:32:28.472]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[02:32:28.472 --> 02:32:29.492]  A true innovation.
[02:32:29.492 --> 02:32:31.573]  I have never seen anything like this.
[02:32:31.573 --> 02:32:33.074]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[02:32:33.274 --> 02:32:35.816]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[02:32:35.816 --> 02:32:39.980]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.
[02:32:39.980 --> 02:32:42.102]  Go to PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[02:32:42.102 --> 02:32:44.123]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.

[02:32:55.653 --> 02:32:57.074]  Limited one per household.
[02:32:57.074 --> 02:32:58.175]  PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[02:33:02.930 --> 02:33:10.974]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:10.974 --> 02:33:18.317]  I know you can see me now, here's a surprise.
[02:33:18.317 --> 02:33:23.439]  I know that you have, cause there's magic in my eyes.
[02:33:23.439 --> 02:33:30.343]  I can see for miles and miles and miles and
[02:33:37.541 --> 02:33:45.188]  All right, this week we've got a lot of big guests coming up, but I do intend to carve a few days out where we take at least two or three hours of calls because the callers bring up a lot of great points.
[02:33:45.188 --> 02:33:48.971]  Had a lot of great callers last night on the Sunday show.
[02:33:48.971 --> 02:33:54.475]  Look, I don't want people to go to sleep by saying we've had huge victories, but I also want people to know we have had some big victories.
[02:33:54.475 --> 02:33:55.596]  Globalism's in trouble.
[02:33:55.596 --> 02:33:56.857]  It's being exposed.
[02:33:56.857 --> 02:34:01.982]  The fact that it's unelected, unaccountable, it's now out there and long term, there's no way it can stand.
[02:34:01.982 --> 02:34:05.024]  I mean, I told you they're going to say Brexit isn't legal.
[02:34:05.024 --> 02:34:05.645]  They always do that.
[02:34:06.496 --> 02:34:10.580]  But then it just causes more votes and more anger and more awakening.
[02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:19.469]  So a lot of exciting things happening and every country that's now voting, who's been able to vote, is voting to lessen the power of the EU or pull out of it.
[02:34:19.469 --> 02:34:20.830]  Italy just last week.
[02:34:20.830 --> 02:34:28.938]  So I want to get both of our guests' view and kind of political weather forecast in the future, whether they agree or disagree with that and other points we haven't gotten to.
[02:34:33.786 --> 02:34:37.969]  But briefly, I also want all the listeners to know that we're running free shipping this week.
[02:34:37.969 --> 02:34:46.375]  I just decided to do this this weekend because we can guarantee shipment if you order by Friday anywhere in the United States.
[02:34:46.375 --> 02:34:50.198]  Shipping's so good with USPS now, even if it gets here Monday, most places, except like Alaska.
[02:34:51.820 --> 02:34:59.551]  But you can get high quality products, not battle the crowds, not battle the lines, get great nutraceuticals, and there's free shipping for this week.
[02:34:59.551 --> 02:35:03.396]  Starting today, 30% off on the Parasite Cleanse Living Defense.
[02:35:03.396 --> 02:35:04.338]  That is a product.

[02:35:09.944 --> 02:35:11.525]  That's basically a loss leader.

[02:35:25.355 --> 02:35:26.636]  BioTruth Selenium.
[02:35:26.636 --> 02:35:27.737]  You die without it, folks.
[02:35:29.679 --> 02:35:31.161]  It is an amazing product.
[02:35:31.161 --> 02:35:32.522]  Store-wide free shipping.
[02:35:32.522 --> 02:35:35.045]  A bunch of other discounts I don't have time to get into.

[02:35:53.932 --> 02:35:59.375]  We've got some great, super high quality, best of the market out there.
[02:35:59.375 --> 02:36:03.918]  Survival gear, sleeping bags, tents, thermal systems, you name it, documentary films.
[02:36:03.918 --> 02:36:04.819]  It's almost sold out.
[02:36:04.819 --> 02:36:05.699]  Trump is my president.
[02:36:05.699 --> 02:36:06.660]  Red shirt.
[02:36:06.660 --> 02:36:11.043]  They also have the Hiller for Prison 2017 with George Soros as a goblin saying deport George Soros.
[02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:15.561]  That is a limited edition as well.
[02:36:15.561 --> 02:36:20.805]  I want to thank you all for your support and tell you to take advantage of the free shipping and those specials.
[02:36:20.805 --> 02:36:21.806]  While supplies last.
[02:36:21.806 --> 02:36:23.447]  Some of the specials are going to end like DNA 4.
[02:36:23.447 --> 02:36:25.309]  It's 25% off because it's about to sell out.
[02:36:27.062 --> 02:36:27.822]  And look what we've done.
[02:36:27.822 --> 02:36:39.547]  We've got the whole globalist world upset at us and it's all because you supported us and I was able to assemble an amazing team from the people behind the scenes to our great reporters like David Knight and Wayne Madsen and waymadsenreport.com.
[02:36:39.547 --> 02:36:40.847]  Check out his books there as well.
[02:36:40.847 --> 02:36:45.049]  And then there's our third-party sponsors that make the show possible, like Solutions from Science.
[02:36:46.237 --> 02:36:48.699]  They have a brand new solar generator that's pocket-sized.
[02:36:48.699 --> 02:36:56.644]  This one, even though it's pocket-sized, can even run a lot of 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator so you can keep your food from spoiling.
[02:36:56.644 --> 02:37:00.988]  It's mobile, so you can jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[02:37:00.988 --> 02:37:02.609]  Yeah, that's how miniaturized batteries have gotten.
[02:37:03.129 --> 02:37:05.249]  It provides an endless supply of electricity from the sun.

[02:37:20.272 --> 02:37:25.333]  That's one reason the globalists admit they want a worldwide monopoly on technology now, because they call these disruptive.
[02:37:25.333 --> 02:37:26.354]  Stuff's getting so good.
[02:37:26.354 --> 02:37:28.594]  Wind power, sun power, solar power.
[02:37:28.874 --> 02:37:32.035]  That it disrupts their monopoly, and that's why they're trying to bring tyranny in.
[02:37:32.035 --> 02:37:33.956]  And finally, Revelations the movie.
[02:37:33.956 --> 02:37:35.197]  It's such a powerful film.
[02:37:35.197 --> 02:37:36.797]  Five years in the making.
[02:37:36.797 --> 02:37:39.478]  Was doing interviews five years ago, right up to last year.
[02:37:39.478 --> 02:37:48.242]  Charlie Daniels, myself, General Boykin, former head of Special Forces, G. Edward Griffin, and so many others that I don't even mention here.
[02:37:48.242 --> 02:37:49.423]  Check it out today.
[02:37:49.423 --> 02:37:50.223]  Joel Skousen.
[02:37:52.142 --> 02:37:56.466]  Oh, you know, the great folks up there with the International Forecaster, Gerald Cilente.
[02:37:56.466 --> 02:38:03.352]  It covers a wide range of topics of the New World or Takeover, June 21, Federal Reserve, nationalism versus globalism, and why the choice is so important.
[02:38:03.352 --> 02:38:13.301]  Visit Revelation, one word, revelationthemovie.info, revelationthemovie.info, to purchase your DVD or check out hosting at the theater near you or your church, revelationthemovie.info.
[02:38:13.301 --> 02:38:16.604]  Okay, I'm done plugging here, but these are great products.
[02:38:16.604 --> 02:38:17.765]  It's how we fund ourselves and
[02:38:18.983 --> 02:38:21.306]  Very low prices right now, so please take advantage of that.
[02:38:21.306 --> 02:38:28.895]  And you can also give it as Christmas presents or put in the checkout comment on the receipt you get when you put in the address of where you want it to go.
[02:38:28.895 --> 02:38:30.377]  Address 2.
[02:38:30.377 --> 02:38:38.506]  Put the comment, hey, you know, to your cousin, your neighbor, your mom, your dad, your son, your daughter, your boss, your employees, your long-lost love, your friend.
[02:38:39.187 --> 02:38:41.028]  And it can be a gift as well.
[02:38:41.028 --> 02:38:45.951]  So you help us fund the operation, you get high quality products from somebody else, and it's just a win-win.
[02:38:45.951 --> 02:38:47.411]  Get your Christmas shopping done.
[02:38:47.411 --> 02:38:51.634]  It is the Christmas specials, we're politically incorrect, so take advantage of that.
[02:38:51.634 --> 02:38:52.774]  Okay, Wayne, I've been ranting.
[02:38:52.774 --> 02:38:54.255]  You've been trying to get a word in edgewise here.
[02:38:54.255 --> 02:38:55.456]  I apologize.
[02:38:55.456 --> 02:38:56.416]  I've got a lot of questions.
[02:38:56.416 --> 02:38:57.177]  I've got a lot of comments.
[02:38:57.177 --> 02:39:05.161]  I've got a lot of places to go and things I want to cover with you, but looking at where all this lays out, this point in history, what else is on your big board?
[02:39:06.570 --> 02:39:20.860]  Well, it's amazing to me to see so many Democrats and some Republicans, like the dementia patient John McCain, resorting to these McCarthy-ite tactics of calling everyone a Russian agent.
[02:39:21.761 --> 02:39:30.611]  You know, when we're back in the 1950s here, I mean, it's like, Trump's an agent, Flynn's an agent.
[02:39:30.611 --> 02:39:34.276]  But then there were some Soviet agents.
[02:39:34.276 --> 02:39:36.799]  I mean, it wasn't as bad as the, I mean, now it's total bull.
[02:39:37.359 --> 02:40:03.297]  Oh no, it's like there's one behind every tree and under your bed and, you know, and I'm not surprised that Soros is helping with this propaganda because he's a Hungarian, he has a visceral hatred for anything Russian, and it's to the point where he and his father were helping the Gestapo at the end of World War II to round up Hungarian Jews and send them to the death camps.
[02:40:04.197 --> 02:40:14.982]  That's somebody that really has a visceral hatred for Russians, because he decided it was better to kiss the Zlot with the Nazis.
[02:40:14.982 --> 02:40:18.683]  And so, I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[02:40:18.683 --> 02:40:24.886]  All these charges that everybody... Look, even Tom Hartman, because he has a show on RT,
[02:40:25.946 --> 02:40:28.667]  Yeah, he's a soros acolyte.
[02:40:28.667 --> 02:40:30.608]  He's accused of being a Russian agent.
[02:40:30.608 --> 02:40:37.310]  Ed Schultz, Larry King, because they have shows on RT, all supposedly now Russian agents.
[02:40:37.310 --> 02:40:43.652]  It's really disgusting that many Democrats and a few of these Republicans are resorting to these tactics.
[02:40:43.812 --> 02:40:57.735]  Sure, but saying Tucker Carlson, that, I mean, the guy actually said, well, you're a Russian agent too, and Tucker starts laughing at the end of the interview because the guy couldn't show proof of, you know, this all being run by the Russians and had just been retracted that very day by the Washington Post.
[02:40:57.735 --> 02:41:00.476]  And of course, Tucker hasn't said this, but I know Tucker had a dinner with him.
[02:41:00.476 --> 02:41:02.197]  I mean, I looked into things.
[02:41:02.197 --> 02:41:06.578]  His dad was the head of Voice of America for like 20 years and a bunch of other clandestine stuff.
[02:41:06.578 --> 02:41:11.739]  I mean, you know, to say his dad, who's probably CIA, was working for the Russians is just a ridiculous joke.
[02:41:12.403 --> 02:41:24.581]  Yeah, I met his dad a few times and yeah, I mean that's kind of ridiculous since he was part of the effort to combat Soviet active measures and disinformation during the Cold War.
[02:41:26.175 --> 02:41:37.360]  These people, again, they're entitled to their own opinions, even though they're flawed, but they're not entitled to their own facts here, and that's what we're seeing.
[02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:43.362]  In many cases, these individuals are casting blame.
[02:41:43.362 --> 02:41:53.386]  I wasn't on that Washington Post list, thepropernut.com, but many publications, including InfoWars, who I write for, were on that list.
[02:41:55.248 --> 02:41:56.589]  I know it's ridiculous.
[02:41:56.589 --> 02:42:00.654]  Well, I've seen you listed as fake news in articles, though, about fake news, so don't worry.
[02:42:00.654 --> 02:42:01.455]  Oh, yeah.
[02:42:01.455 --> 02:42:05.020]  Yeah, no, there was a couple Twitter messages that stated that.
[02:42:05.020 --> 02:42:06.882]  So, fake news, yeah.
[02:42:06.882 --> 02:42:08.844]  Well, let's look at the Washington Post, 1981, Janet Cook.
[02:42:11.367 --> 02:42:18.070]  I wrote an article about a seven-year-old African-American boy named Jimmy in D.C.
[02:42:18.070 --> 02:42:19.811]  who was a heroin addict.
[02:42:19.811 --> 02:42:23.313]  Got the Pulitzer Prize for it except one problem.
[02:42:23.313 --> 02:42:24.353]  They had to retract it.
[02:42:24.353 --> 02:42:31.737]  She made up the story even though the great Bob Woodward is the one who nominated her for the Pulitzer.
[02:42:31.737 --> 02:42:33.617]  Jason Blair, New York Times, 34
[02:42:34.778 --> 02:42:39.739]  What do you think of the New York Times hiring the guy from Politico that said, quote, I'm a hack.
[02:42:39.739 --> 02:42:40.540]  Tell me what to do.
[02:42:40.540 --> 02:42:42.100]  I'll write anything you want.
[02:42:42.100 --> 02:42:42.660]  I'll lie.
[02:42:42.660 --> 02:42:45.201]  And they're like, oh, that's great credentials.
[02:42:45.201 --> 02:42:48.062]  You're a discredited, lying hack in the WikiLeaks.
[02:42:48.062 --> 02:42:49.282]  Let's hire you.
[02:42:49.282 --> 02:42:49.722]  Yeah.
[02:42:49.722 --> 02:42:49.982]  Yeah.
[02:42:49.982 --> 02:42:57.364]  Well, look, you want fake news, go to the New York Times, Washington Post, the New Republic, USA Today.
[02:42:57.364 --> 02:42:59.045]  They've all had their share.
[02:42:59.045 --> 02:43:00.865]  Brian Williams, of all people.
[02:43:00.865 --> 02:43:03.926]  I mean, if you notice, he's the new crusader against fake news.
[02:43:04.466 --> 02:43:06.248]  Yeah, you know, you can't make it up.
[02:43:06.248 --> 02:43:07.669]  You just can't make it up.
[02:43:07.669 --> 02:43:09.911]  I've never seen anything like this.
[02:43:09.911 --> 02:43:11.192]  Let me ask you about the psychology.
[02:43:11.192 --> 02:43:12.514]  I mean, you're really a smart guy.
[02:43:12.514 --> 02:43:14.535]  I mean, I really want your view on this, and I want David's view on this.
[02:43:14.535 --> 02:43:15.837]  Jump in any time, David.
[02:43:15.837 --> 02:43:17.098]  This is co-host Free For All here.
[02:43:17.098 --> 02:43:20.041]  We're all co-hosting together right now on a panel.
[02:43:20.041 --> 02:43:21.982]  What is the mental illness that's come over him?
[02:43:21.982 --> 02:43:22.763]  And I want to add to that.
[02:43:22.763 --> 02:43:28.689]  I've lived in Austin, liberal towns since high school, but it was good old-fashioned liberals that were against torture, war, all this kind of stuff.
[02:43:29.389 --> 02:43:32.692]  Now, I get confronted every time I go out.
[02:43:32.692 --> 02:43:34.914]  Grocery store, hike and bike trail.
[02:43:34.914 --> 02:43:39.578]  I had a guy walk up, pull a gun out and say, you think you're tough now, you know, you piece of crap.
[02:43:39.578 --> 02:43:42.380]  I mean, they're going crazy right now.
[02:43:42.380 --> 02:43:47.464]  And they just seem like they're going, like, you know, dying or something.
[02:43:47.464 --> 02:43:48.385]  And I don't get it.
[02:43:48.385 --> 02:43:52.188]  For Hillary Clinton, this monster, and then they're lying about Trump.
[02:43:52.188 --> 02:43:53.309]  What the hell happened to him?
[02:43:54.572 --> 02:43:59.554]  They remind me of the people who follow Jim Jones down to Jonestown in Guyana.
[02:43:59.554 --> 02:44:05.116]  I mean, I think these people are delusional, and that's being kind.
[02:44:05.116 --> 02:44:10.018]  Some of them are plain mentally ill, I think, the way they're spreading around certain
[02:44:10.718 --> 02:44:29.762]  Uh, stories, but, uh, you know, I guess that's, uh, that's the kind of environment we live in now with, you know, and now they want to brief, there's a call to brief all the members of the Electoral College to give them a CIA intelligence briefing where they'll be lied to by the CIA about fake intelligence.
[02:44:29.762 --> 02:44:37.304]  Oh yeah, they're saying, the Democrats are saying, brief everyone, get involved like the mafia with a jury, that's what they are, but they've already been given the vote.
[02:44:38.104 --> 02:44:44.667]  The jury foreman's been given the vote to deliver, and they say, let the CIA come in and tell them, don't vote for Trump because the Rooskies.
[02:44:44.667 --> 02:44:50.409]  Well, what we should show them, Alex, is that clip from the Defense Department briefing, remember a few years ago, what was it, two years ago?
[02:44:50.409 --> 02:44:59.233]  Where the one lady who was an officer stood up and said to the Defense Department official, nobody believes us anymore, it's just mindless propaganda.
[02:44:59.813 --> 02:45:01.354]  That's what they should show these jerks.
[02:45:01.354 --> 02:45:06.436]  Yeah, that's in the article, Pentagon promises to stop lying because of Matt Drudge.
[02:45:06.436 --> 02:45:13.980]  The Undersecretary of Defense gets up and they have people at the SIOP meeting, both military and civilian, getting up and going, what?
[02:45:13.980 --> 02:45:15.000]  We don't have to lie anymore?
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:15.600]  They didn't get that.
[02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:19.302]  That was a new announcement that they're going domestic and we promised to stop lying.
[02:45:19.302 --> 02:45:20.763]  That was the rollout of the lying.
[02:45:20.763 --> 02:45:24.404]  This one woman gets up from the military and she doesn't quite get it.
[02:45:24.404 --> 02:45:26.305]  She goes, I'm really sick of lying.
[02:45:26.305 --> 02:45:27.066]  Can I tell the truth?
[02:45:27.066 --> 02:45:27.766]  Because they don't believe us.
[02:45:28.046 --> 02:45:29.867]  Excuse me ma'am, you didn't quite get this.
[02:45:48.012 --> 02:45:57.814]  And yet they're pushing hardcore xenophobia by saying foreign influence is why we have to give the State Department the ability to propagandize America.
[02:45:57.814 --> 02:45:59.694]  They're going to put out fact-based narratives.
[02:45:59.694 --> 02:46:02.215]  We're going to give them $160 million to do this.
[02:46:02.215 --> 02:46:04.655]  We're going to make the State Department the center of this.
[02:46:04.655 --> 02:46:08.196]  That is why they're pushing back and they're using xenophobia to do it.
[02:46:08.196 --> 02:46:14.117]  And doesn't that, so it's okay that we're going to have blacklists in state remedy because we're fighting the racism, which is actually creating the division.
[02:46:14.117 --> 02:46:15.877]  Wayne, looking at the psychology though,
[02:46:17.085 --> 02:46:19.168]  Again, I know you talk about the mentally ill followers of it.
[02:46:19.168 --> 02:46:20.769]  What about the press themselves?
[02:46:20.769 --> 02:46:25.435]  They've only seemed to get more arrogant, and they're doing more of what brought them to where they are.
[02:46:25.435 --> 02:46:30.301]  I don't think they realize most of the military, and even intelligence people now, are awake.
[02:46:30.301 --> 02:46:34.305]  So if they try some weird soft coup, I expect it's going to blow up in their face.
[02:46:35.185 --> 02:46:41.192]  Well, this is because you've got ownership of the media and so few corporate hands.
[02:46:41.192 --> 02:46:46.758]  They can actually get together and, you know, on Monday morning say, OK, this is what we're going to do.
[02:46:46.758 --> 02:46:49.721]  This is going to be the lead this week.
[02:46:49.721 --> 02:46:50.682]  This is where we're going.
[02:46:50.682 --> 02:46:52.664]  Everybody runs with the pack.
[02:46:52.664 --> 02:46:54.947]  And it's very easy to do that.
[02:46:55.447 --> 02:47:10.193]  You know, people, it reminds me of the movie Network, where Peter Finch, who played Howard Beale, the network anchorman, said, everybody, turn off your TVs, go to the window, put your head out the window and say, I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.
[02:47:10.193 --> 02:47:19.597]  I think basically Trump has tapped into the people, the fictional people in that movie who said, yeah, that's, that's, he's speaking for me.
[02:47:19.597 --> 02:47:23.619]  And they, you know, people all over the country stuck their head out the window and said, I'm mad as hell.
[02:47:24.039 --> 02:47:25.360]  And I'm not going to take it anymore.
[02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:34.447]  And I think people, as we saw with the election results, basically did the same thing at the polling place.
[02:47:34.447 --> 02:47:50.400]  So, looking at foreign governments, looking at what the CIA has done before here, and overthrowing other governments, if they do try a power play, we know they're trying to get the delegates to go against him, the electors to go against him, if that doesn't work, they've shown they're not going to give up, they're totally mentally ill, what do they do next?
[02:47:51.175 --> 02:47:55.436]  Well, I think he's really going to have to have somebody to come out in his organization if he doesn't want to do it.
[02:47:55.436 --> 02:47:59.298]  He's going to have to have somebody come out and say, this is why we have the Electoral College.
[02:47:59.298 --> 02:48:02.199]  It is a firewall against the concentration of power.
[02:48:02.199 --> 02:48:08.761]  It is a firewall against the corruption that you find in certain jurisdictions, like New York or California or whatever, the big cities.
[02:48:08.761 --> 02:48:10.982]  That's what its purpose is, to contain that.
[02:48:12.022 --> 02:48:25.185]  Exactly, and so they have to defend that, and then they also have to put this in the context of these people saying, well we're going to change the electors who are going, the delegates who are going to go to the convention, and we're going to get them to have their own decision here.
[02:48:25.185 --> 02:48:27.206]  Now we're going to do the same thing with the Electoral College.
[02:48:27.206 --> 02:48:32.467]  And the lesson is this, Trump fought it, so they weren't able to steal his nomination.
[02:48:32.467 --> 02:48:34.187]  Sanders didn't, he lost it.
[02:48:34.187 --> 02:48:36.248]  The lesson is, Trump must go on the attack.
[02:48:37.577 --> 02:48:40.359]  I'm going to go back to you on this attack against the Electoral College.
[02:48:40.359 --> 02:48:43.281]  Wayne, how does he go on the attack?
[02:48:43.281 --> 02:48:49.125]  As I say, I think what he needs to do, he needs to be really tough on what the CIA is doing right now.
[02:48:49.125 --> 02:48:59.293]  He needs to call for a commission after he's inaugurated to say, look, this is an intelligent... I agree with you, you said that earlier, but what does he do in the next 38 days, my friend?
[02:49:00.154 --> 02:49:09.517]  Well, I think he's got to keep up the offense on the people, these McCarthy-ite tactics of saying everybody's a Russian agent.
[02:49:09.517 --> 02:49:19.320]  It's ridiculous, because that can lead, obviously, Russia's a nuclear superpower, that can lead to war, and maybe that's... Well, that's my next question.
[02:49:19.320 --> 02:49:21.261]  What do you think Russia's thinking by all this?
[02:49:22.383 --> 02:49:40.087]  Well, I mean, you know, Russia has been putting up with this fake fakery with the news in the West and fake intelligence now for, you know, 15 years or more, that Russia is doing all these things because it's aggressive.
[02:49:40.847 --> 02:49:51.130]  It was told that NATO would not, first it was told by Madeleine Albright, NATO's not going to expand into Poland, Czech and Slovak, and Hungary, and it did.
[02:49:51.130 --> 02:49:53.190]  And they said, well it's not going to expand.
[02:49:53.190 --> 02:50:04.893]  And they watched them bomb Serbia and hand it over to the Muslims, they watched them take over the Middle East and hand it to radicals, and they see them moving up their borders, saying we come in peace, we come in peace, but like in Mars Attacks, they don't come in peace.
[02:50:05.473 --> 02:50:06.354]  Right, right.
[02:50:06.354 --> 02:50:09.459]  I mean, it was to the point they were going to be in Ukraine and Georgia.
[02:50:09.459 --> 02:50:11.321]  They were going to surround Russia.
[02:50:11.321 --> 02:50:16.168]  I mean, you'd have NATO going up the Volga River if they had a chance.
[02:50:16.168 --> 02:50:19.252]  And then our media says Russia invaded Ukraine.
[02:50:19.252 --> 02:50:21.315]  When Soros brags, he overthrew the thing.
[02:50:22.952 --> 02:50:23.732]  Right, right.
[02:50:23.732 --> 02:50:24.513]  Twice.
[02:50:24.513 --> 02:50:32.295]  Soros was involved in the Orange Revolution in 2004 and the Maidan Revolution in 2014.
[02:50:32.295 --> 02:50:33.035]  That's twice.
[02:50:33.035 --> 02:50:35.495]  Let me ask you this question when we come back.
[02:50:35.495 --> 02:50:39.957]  Why is Soros still above ground, not pushing daisies?
[02:50:39.957 --> 02:50:42.377]  I mean, he's got so many enemies.
[02:50:42.377 --> 02:50:44.718]  This guy is like Dr. Evil on PCP.
[02:50:45.902 --> 02:50:51.127]  Well, the British even actually used Quantum, which was his organization, as the James Bond villain.
[02:50:51.127 --> 02:50:52.348]  They knew exactly who he was.
[02:50:52.348 --> 02:50:54.370]  He is a James Bond villain.
[02:50:54.370 --> 02:50:55.971]  What is his problem?
[02:50:55.971 --> 02:50:56.552]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:00.154 --> 02:51:11.020]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[02:51:11.020 --> 02:51:15.183]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[02:51:15.183 --> 02:51:17.324]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:17.324 --> 02:51:22.767]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:22.927 --> 02:51:32.915]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:51:32.915 --> 02:51:39.400]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:51:39.400 --> 02:51:42.723]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[02:51:42.723 --> 02:51:44.784]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:51:44.784 --> 02:51:47.887]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:51:47.947 --> 02:51:48.687]  Maybe not today.
[02:51:48.687 --> 02:51:49.707]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[02:51:49.707 --> 02:51:53.208]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:51:53.208 --> 02:51:54.269]  Forget bunkers.

[02:54:02.448 --> 02:54:09.092]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:54:09.092 --> 02:54:12.654]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:12.654 --> 02:54:14.175]  I'll go five minutes to the next hour.
[02:54:14.175 --> 02:54:15.416]  It's customary with Wayne Madsen.
[02:54:15.416 --> 02:54:17.217]  Then David Nye is going to take over.
[02:54:17.217 --> 02:54:18.358]  He wants to take your phone calls.

[02:54:22.340 --> 02:54:22.400]  800-259-9231.
[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:22.500]  Look.
[02:54:28.755 --> 02:54:29.256]  It's real.
[02:54:29.256 --> 02:54:30.397]  We're under global attack.
[02:54:30.397 --> 02:54:32.659]  We are the spearhead, not just the tip of the spear.
[02:54:32.659 --> 02:54:34.821]  We need your prayers, your support.
[02:54:34.821 --> 02:54:36.522]  I want to thank you for what you've done so far.
[02:54:36.522 --> 02:54:37.943]  I didn't ask for this position.
[02:54:37.943 --> 02:54:39.044]  I never knew I'd be in this position.
[02:54:39.044 --> 02:54:43.549]  I just thought I would ring the alarm bells and other men better than I would stand up and fight the new world order.
[02:54:43.549 --> 02:54:49.094]  Because I take it personal to be conquered by a bunch of global banks that want to make me poor and dumb me down and admit it.
[02:54:50.043 --> 02:55:00.810]  There's an article by Kit Daniels up on Infowars.com that boils down a bunch of key reports I filed this weekend about how I believe they're getting ready to try to assassinate Trump and the proof that this whole CIA thing is fake.
[02:55:00.810 --> 02:55:03.192]  Paul Watson's doing a video right now about how it's all a big hoax.
[02:55:03.192 --> 02:55:04.253]  That's coming out.
[02:55:04.253 --> 02:55:05.534]  Anti-Trump, false flag.
[02:55:06.374 --> 02:55:12.957]  Rogue CIA, globalist left attempt to overthrow Trump, maximum alert, globalist claim Americans did not choose Trump.
[02:55:12.957 --> 02:55:14.778]  I think that's really emblematic.
[02:55:14.778 --> 02:55:20.160]  The CIA and the Democrats claim you didn't choose Trump, you can't have it, you're a Russian
[02:55:22.162 --> 02:55:22.723]  Moron!
[02:55:22.723 --> 02:55:24.585]  You're a useful idiot!
[02:55:24.585 --> 02:55:27.487]  You're a Russian dupe!
[02:55:27.487 --> 02:55:30.050]  That is such an insult by this arrogant!
[02:55:30.050 --> 02:55:36.576]  You know, I've read a lot of novels, I've read a lot of history, I've read a lot, I've seen a lot of movies, but fiction is so much crazier, Wayne Madsen.
[02:55:36.576 --> 02:55:41.441]  The arrogance of the imperial press, how discredited, how loathed!
[02:55:41.441 --> 02:55:44.765]  And now they've got, in movies, I checked it out on Caller Called,
[02:55:45.565 --> 02:55:51.132]  Well, I guess I would just point out, you know, they said that Paul Manafort, who was the former campaign chairman,
[02:56:07.253 --> 02:56:22.465]  For Trump, they've said he's a Russian agent because he had a lot, you know, he was basically a lobbyist and he was representing the interests of the Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was overthrown by the Soros revolution in 2014.
[02:56:23.666 --> 02:56:27.927]  Manifoldovich was the democratically elected president of Ukraine!
[02:56:27.927 --> 02:56:35.410]  That's the thing, I've talked to Roger Stone about this, and Manifold said, why come on and tell the public, they just don't, they're just not sophisticated enough.
[02:56:35.410 --> 02:56:38.231]  He helped put people in that were anti-Russian!
[02:56:39.008 --> 02:56:44.334]  But Podesta was involved just as much as Manafort was, and they never said anything about Podesta's involvement as a lobbyist.
[02:56:44.334 --> 02:56:45.515]  Exactly.
[02:56:45.515 --> 02:56:46.817]  It's picking and choosing.
[02:56:46.817 --> 02:56:48.158]  It's cherry-picking.
[02:56:48.158 --> 02:56:49.179]  And that's what they're doing.
[02:56:49.179 --> 02:56:55.366]  This new McCarthyism is just frightening.
[02:56:55.366 --> 02:57:00.332]  The Democrats are going to pay a big price for what they're doing and demonizing people.
[02:57:00.992 --> 02:57:02.914]  Uh, like what happened in the 1950s.
[02:57:02.914 --> 02:57:05.635]  Well, yeah, I mean, it's beyond calling us deplorables.
[02:57:05.635 --> 02:57:11.099]  What do you make of the FBI coming out and challenging the CIA and saying, uh, no, you don't have proof of this?
[02:57:11.604 --> 02:57:15.046]  Oh, they're trying to say Comey's another Russian agent now.
[02:57:15.046 --> 02:57:21.189]  Look, the FBI has responsibility for foreign counterintelligence activities in the United States.
[02:57:21.189 --> 02:57:23.210]  They're the experts on that.
[02:57:23.210 --> 02:57:24.771]  I'll go with the FBI.
[02:57:24.771 --> 02:57:29.573]  That's weird coming from me who's been visited by them on several occasions.
[02:57:29.573 --> 02:57:32.255]  But I'll go with the FBI's good judgment on that.
[02:57:32.255 --> 02:57:34.896]  They know the CIA is making it up.
[02:57:35.802 --> 02:57:43.814]  And of course we see that in Georgia, you had the Department of Homeland Security actually try to hack in there, and they had to admit it, and they said, well, it was a rogue employee.
[02:57:43.814 --> 02:57:50.283]  But of course, it couldn't be a rogue employee that exposed all these emails from Hillary Clinton and Podesta.
[02:57:50.283 --> 02:57:52.106]  No, it couldn't be a rogue employee.
[02:57:53.007 --> 02:57:57.069]  Apparently they also were caught going into the systems in Illinois.
[02:57:57.069 --> 02:57:58.969]  So we have a pattern of DHS doing it.
[02:57:58.969 --> 02:57:59.730]  All right, Wayne.
[02:57:59.730 --> 02:58:02.230]  Wayne, do five more minutes with us and then David Knight's going to take over.
[02:58:02.230 --> 02:58:03.711]  He's got a lot, a full plate.
[02:58:03.711 --> 02:58:06.112]  I want to come back and ask you a few other questions on the other side.
[02:58:06.112 --> 02:58:08.653]  Folks, visit WayneMadisonReport.com.

[02:58:29.936 --> 02:58:31.538]  We were right about that.

[03:00:10.732 --> 03:00:10.752]  38!
[03:00:10.752 --> 03:00:11.152]  38 Days!
[03:00:21.597 --> 03:00:26.300]  And Trump will be in, and I know you're going to talk more about this coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:26.300 --> 03:00:32.664]  If you want me to, you want to take calls and ask what callers think, you're going to get more into some of these nominees.
[03:00:32.664 --> 03:00:37.687]  Rex Tillerson was previously anti-carbon tax, anti-global warming.
[03:00:37.687 --> 03:00:39.528]  They threatened to remove him, then he became for it.
[03:00:39.528 --> 03:00:40.829]  Trump says he's against it.
[03:00:40.829 --> 03:00:44.071]  I know his new EPA head is Attorney General of Oklahoma.
[03:00:44.071 --> 03:00:45.472]  He says it's a total fraud.
[03:00:45.472 --> 03:00:47.153]  Rick Perry was against carbon taxes.
[03:00:47.153 --> 03:00:48.814]  I don't like him for the Department of Energy.
[03:00:50.074 --> 03:00:51.455]  And so it goes on and on.
[03:00:51.455 --> 03:00:59.417]  This Marine Corps journal that was for Gitmo, I get not liking Al Qaeda, I get the fact, but you've got to have due process or it ends up being used against us.
[03:00:59.417 --> 03:01:01.558]  There's some problems with these appointments.
[03:01:01.558 --> 03:01:05.679]  But what I care about is he's bringing the jobs back and I want to see what he does once he gets in office.
[03:01:05.679 --> 03:01:11.441]  The CIA and the globalists in Soros trying to block our election is front and center for me right now.
[03:01:11.441 --> 03:01:12.861]  That's what I'm focusing on.
[03:01:12.861 --> 03:01:17.323]  Trump goes sideways, we're going to keep him honest or die trying politically.
[03:01:17.323 --> 03:01:18.323]  But Wayne, other points.
[03:01:19.363 --> 03:01:23.945]  Well, it's going to be interesting to see who his pick is for CIA director.
[03:01:23.945 --> 03:01:39.472]  The word is that Carly Fiorina may be the DNI, Director of National Intelligence, but that CIA director is going to be very key because he's going to have to have somebody with the mandate to go in there and shake that place up and the people who have been involved in domestic
[03:01:39.972 --> 03:01:45.155]  Politics, partisan politics have got to be shown the door.
[03:01:45.155 --> 03:01:49.377]  And it's going to be a very, they need a tough guy to do that, a leader or a woman.
[03:01:49.377 --> 03:01:53.699]  Well, I'll tell you, they're arrogant to go up against Trump who they know is vindictive.
[03:01:53.699 --> 03:01:56.101]  At least he keeps score, trying to keep him out.
[03:01:56.101 --> 03:01:58.582]  They've got to know that he's coming after them now.
[03:01:59.428 --> 03:02:01.849]  Well, he knows how to say, you're fired.
[03:02:01.849 --> 03:02:04.691]  I mean, he did that on this reality show.
[03:02:04.691 --> 03:02:07.972]  So, you know, we know he's capable of doing it.
[03:02:07.972 --> 03:02:14.116]  He said, you know, apparently done it with a couple of people who supported him and were on the transition team.
[03:02:14.116 --> 03:02:16.597]  So I think he should scorched earth.
[03:02:16.597 --> 03:02:20.699]  I mean, basically, I think it's time for all the old both party people.
[03:02:20.699 --> 03:02:22.140]  Anybody that didn't support him, gone.
[03:02:25.001 --> 03:02:27.343]  William Binney is the head of the CIA.
[03:02:27.343 --> 03:02:28.304]  He's a tough guy.
[03:02:28.304 --> 03:02:31.866]  He stood up to the NSA and he said this is against the Constitution.
[03:02:31.866 --> 03:02:33.408]  And he ran the program against the Russians.
[03:02:33.408 --> 03:02:34.388]  He's highly decorated.
[03:02:34.388 --> 03:02:36.370]  He knows all the technical issues.
[03:02:36.370 --> 03:02:38.632]  He's not going to be gaslighted by these people.
[03:02:38.632 --> 03:02:40.273]  Hey yeah, what about William Binney for CIA director?
[03:02:42.334 --> 03:02:46.656]  I'm all for Bill Binney over there.
[03:02:46.656 --> 03:02:50.077]  At least, unlike some CIA directors, he knows how to drive there.
[03:02:50.077 --> 03:02:53.978]  He knows the directions how to get to the CIA quarters.
[03:02:53.978 --> 03:02:59.100]  I wonder about some of the past directors, whether they actually knew where to show up for work.
[03:02:59.721 --> 03:03:00.882]  Now what do you make of Hayden?
[03:03:00.882 --> 03:03:03.083]  He just comes off as a candy ass.
[03:03:03.083 --> 03:03:13.369]  Oh well, you know, the NSA director, CIA director, I called him when he was head of NSA, I called it Hayden's heroes.
[03:03:15.030 --> 03:03:16.490]  I did a thing with Hogan.
[03:03:16.490 --> 03:03:22.452]  He, you know, he was wearing the, you know, he was in this, where Colonel Hogan was.
[03:03:22.452 --> 03:03:23.612]  I mean, the guy's a joke.
[03:03:23.612 --> 03:03:32.875]  You know, he didn't even know what the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution was at a speech he gave at the National Press Club.
[03:03:32.875 --> 03:03:35.696]  I don't know where they find these people.
[03:03:35.696 --> 03:03:41.017]  But look, Brennan's got to be one of the first guys, of course.
[03:03:41.017 --> 03:03:43.878]  I hope that he doesn't convince Trump to keep him on.
[03:03:44.418 --> 03:03:45.999]  In some temporary capacity.
[03:03:45.999 --> 03:03:50.762]  That's right, if he keeps Brennan on when he's pulling all this with Trump, I mean, this is insane.
[03:03:50.762 --> 03:03:52.763]  Yeah, he's going to have his back.
[03:03:52.763 --> 03:03:59.407]  And we now know that Brennan has authorized the jihadist rebels in Syria to have these shoulder-launched missiles.
[03:03:59.407 --> 03:04:02.609]  So, you know, they could be used against Russian planes, of course.
[03:04:02.609 --> 03:04:06.671]  Oh yeah, but they're saying Trump only gets a weekly briefing, so if there's any terror attacks, it's his fault.
[03:04:06.671 --> 03:04:08.312]  No, it's Obama and Brennan's fault.
[03:04:08.851 --> 03:04:18.597]  Yeah, so Brennan wants them to shoot down Russian Su-34 fighters, but those same missiles can be used to bring down commercial aircraft.
[03:04:18.597 --> 03:04:23.840]  I mean, who's running that show up there at Langley?
[03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:31.485]  Look, what Trump needs to do is he needs to say, also the CIA is aiding and abetting terrorism in Syria and other countries.
[03:04:31.485 --> 03:04:32.386]  Same thing he's been saying.
[03:04:32.386 --> 03:04:34.027]  Hillary's the founder of ISIS.
[03:04:34.027 --> 03:04:35.868]  All right, thank you so much, Wayne Madsen.
[03:04:35.868 --> 03:04:37.128]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:04:37.128 --> 03:04:37.729]  Good to be with you.
[03:04:38.683 --> 03:04:40.324]  I'm going to cut some reports for the Nightly News.
[03:04:40.324 --> 03:04:42.004]  We have a lot of other stuff done.
[03:04:42.004 --> 03:04:45.365]  We've got a little special intro coming in next segment.
[03:04:45.365 --> 03:04:48.506]  And David and I will be sitting right here taking over the transmission.
[03:04:48.506 --> 03:04:49.626]  Please support the broadcast.
[03:04:49.626 --> 03:04:51.427]  We're under attack because we're having an effect.
[03:04:51.427 --> 03:04:53.087]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:04:53.087 --> 03:04:54.168]  Spread that link.

[03:04:56.908 --> 03:04:58.429]  There's new ones popping up every five minutes.
[03:04:59.580 --> 03:05:03.721]  A former Icelandic Minister of Interior is claiming that the U.S.
[03:05:03.721 --> 03:05:09.743]  sent FBI agents to frame Julian Assange during a goodwill mission to Iceland in 2011.
[03:05:09.743 --> 03:05:17.186]  Now this troubling report has come to light and it's reviewing how the Obama administration links that it will go to, to a framed Julian Assange.
[03:05:17.406 --> 03:05:18.888]  The minister says the U.S.
[03:05:18.888 --> 03:05:30.499]  sent, quote, a plane load of FBI agents to Iceland in June of 2011 to both frame WikiLeaks and Assange, according to this minister, who refused them any cooperation and asked them to leave the country immediately.
[03:05:30.499 --> 03:05:38.868]  He claims that the Obama administration implied to Iceland officials that they had knowledge of, quote, hackers wanting to destroy software systems in the country and offered help.
[03:05:39.068 --> 03:05:43.332]  Well, the Interior Minister, Mr. Johansson, said he became suspicious of the U.S.
[03:05:43.332 --> 03:05:46.775]  good intentions and said, quote, I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:05:59.394 --> 03:06:02.556]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:06:02.556 --> 03:06:06.639]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[03:06:06.639 --> 03:06:09.301]  Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[03:06:09.301 --> 03:06:12.123]  I'm Charlie Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[03:06:12.123 --> 03:06:17.327]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[03:06:17.867 --> 03:06:24.075]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[03:06:24.075 --> 03:06:30.363]  God was in school, morality had a future, and the beef was for supper.
[03:06:30.363 --> 03:06:32.926]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[03:06:33.286 --> 03:06:34.467]  We're the solution!
[03:06:34.467 --> 03:06:35.408]  Americans!
[03:06:35.408 --> 03:06:36.969]  Ain't nothin' more to it than that!
[03:06:36.969 --> 03:06:42.373]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[03:06:42.373 --> 03:06:44.014]  Theatrical screenings on demand.

[03:08:01.203 --> 03:08:14.227]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:18.431 --> 03:08:20.813]  Tell your children not to walk my way.
[03:08:37.119 --> 03:08:46.702]  Historically, when governments move against free press, major wars and absolute horrors are committed against the people.
[03:08:46.702 --> 03:08:58.345]  As we speak, the European Union is openly calling to shut down the quote alt-right in the United States and is ordering Facebook, Google and others to censor InfoWars.com by name.
[03:08:58.345 --> 03:08:59.966]  If InfoWars can be silenced,
[03:09:00.806 --> 03:09:02.867]  You can be silenced as well.
[03:09:02.867 --> 03:09:05.089]  Let's stand up for free press.
[03:09:05.089 --> 03:09:09.331]  Let's stand up for free speech, not just here in the US, but worldwide.
[03:09:09.331 --> 03:09:13.294]  That's what our Bill of Rights and Constitution are all about.
[03:09:13.294 --> 03:09:15.635]  That's why it's called the First Amendment.
[03:09:15.635 --> 03:09:19.258]  First, because it is the most important.
[03:09:19.258 --> 03:09:22.239]  If we shut down free speech, the light goes out of the world.
[03:09:41.192 --> 03:09:42.874]  Oh my God!
[03:09:42.874 --> 03:09:45.375]  Oh my God!
[03:09:45.375 --> 03:09:47.637]  Oh my God!
[03:09:47.637 --> 03:09:50.239]  Oh my God!
[03:10:23.320 --> 03:10:37.888]  Okay and of course that was that clip of all the people in Korea crying because their dear leader departed and we saw the beginning of that Hillary Clinton dressed in purple because whenever she bothers to comb her hair and go outside the apartment she always wears purple now.
[03:10:38.388 --> 03:10:39.549]  Because that's the way they're going to roll.
[03:10:39.549 --> 03:10:43.291]  Look, we have to understand the narrative and how this thing has progressed.
[03:10:43.291 --> 03:10:47.734]  Understand that the very next day after the election, what do we have?
[03:10:47.734 --> 03:10:48.575]  We had riots.
[03:10:48.575 --> 03:10:50.376]  Then they moved from that to recounts.
[03:10:50.376 --> 03:10:54.479]  And now we have this attack with the Electoral College.
[03:10:54.479 --> 03:10:57.301]  Remember, first it was an attack on the Electoral College.
[03:10:57.301 --> 03:11:00.903]  They said, how dare we even have an Electoral College?
[03:11:00.903 --> 03:11:03.305]  How undemocratic to have an Electoral College?
[03:11:03.305 --> 03:11:05.686]  Why don't we just have the people make the decision?
[03:11:05.686 --> 03:11:07.187]  And now look at what they've done.
[03:11:07.187 --> 03:11:07.808]  They flipped it.
[03:11:08.408 --> 03:11:16.674]  They said, no, we need the Electoral College to make the correct decision and overrule what the people voted for, state by state.
[03:11:16.674 --> 03:11:19.536]  That's what these electors here in Texas and other places are saying.
[03:11:19.536 --> 03:11:23.839]  We don't care that there are millions of Texans who voted for Donald Trump.
[03:11:23.839 --> 03:11:32.645]  No, the guy who wasn't on the ballot, the elector that I didn't see on the ballot, is going to say, no, I'm going to make the decision for you because you didn't get the right answers.
[03:11:32.805 --> 03:11:37.588]  Same thing we saw at the Republican Convention, pushing the delegates to do that, the elites doing that.
[03:11:37.588 --> 03:11:46.253]  They came out, they said, we don't want to have an electoral college because it's undemocratic, and now they want to throw away your democratic vote using the electoral college.
[03:11:46.253 --> 03:11:47.394]  You see how they switch it?
[03:11:47.394 --> 03:11:52.237]  Remember how they were talking about how globalism was nothing but a conspiracy theory?
[03:11:52.237 --> 03:11:57.000]  Then, during this election, they came out and they said, no, no, globalism is a good thing.
[03:11:57.813 --> 03:11:59.015]  You should want globalism.
[03:11:59.015 --> 03:12:00.957]  Look at all the advantages of globalism.
[03:12:00.957 --> 03:12:07.866]  And then when they got defeated on globalism versus Americanism, they came back and said globalism is a conspiracy theory again.
[03:12:08.536 --> 03:12:13.681]  See, they change whatever they're saying to fit their agenda, time and again.
[03:12:13.681 --> 03:12:18.326]  And we need to understand, when we look at what happened with the NDAA, and again, you want to talk about fake news?
[03:12:18.326 --> 03:12:19.867]  Let's talk about the NDAA.
[03:12:19.867 --> 03:12:21.629]  That is fake security.
[03:12:21.629 --> 03:12:23.671]  It's not real security.
[03:12:23.671 --> 03:12:31.739]  When they take away your Fourth Amendment, when they take away your due process, when they say we're going to have indefinite detention without trial, that's fake security.
[03:12:32.657 --> 03:12:44.225]  When you sacrifice your liberty, when you sacrifice your fundamental human rights, your protections against government abuses for the promise of security, you'll never get safe.
[03:12:44.225 --> 03:12:45.626]  You'll never have security.
[03:12:45.626 --> 03:12:51.070]  As I've said many times, when you give up your liberty and your freedom and your dignity as a human being,
[03:12:51.570 --> 03:12:54.651]  To that extent, you become a nameless slave.
[03:12:54.651 --> 03:12:58.231]  And nameless slaves are never safe, they're never secure.
[03:12:58.231 --> 03:13:06.053]  And yet we have these same people, like Senator Rob Portman, who if you remember going back to the election, he came out and he endorsed Donald Trump.
[03:13:06.053 --> 03:13:11.034]  And then the beginning of October, he said, no, no, no, I have to withdraw my support of Donald Trump.
[03:13:11.034 --> 03:13:19.616]  This is the same guy who's a co-author of this propaganda bill, turning the State Department into a ministry of truth.
[03:13:19.616 --> 03:13:20.296]  How Orwellian.
[03:13:20.976 --> 03:13:21.496]  Listen to this.
[03:13:21.496 --> 03:13:25.778]  The State Department is going to coordinate and synchronize counter-propaganda efforts.
[03:13:25.778 --> 03:13:29.479]  Again, this is an article by Zero Hedge that's up on Infowars.com.
[03:13:29.479 --> 03:13:35.320]  Senate quietly passes the quote-unquote countering disinformation and propaganda act.
[03:13:35.320 --> 03:13:41.803]  This is something that was put together by Rob Portman and a Democrat, Chris Murphy of Connecticut.
[03:13:41.803 --> 03:13:45.744]  They put this thing together and then on Thursday, before the vote on Friday for the NDAA,
[03:13:46.772 --> 03:13:48.613]  They quietly stuck this thing in.
[03:13:48.613 --> 03:13:57.641]  So they can stick all this stuff in to these security bills because they know that virtually everybody is going to vote for the Defense Authorization Act.
[03:13:57.641 --> 03:13:59.402]  That's what funds the military.
[03:13:59.402 --> 03:14:05.867]  So they load this up, not with pork spending anymore, but with liberty killing amendments.
[03:14:05.867 --> 03:14:08.129]  The place where they hung out with the indefinite detention.
[03:14:08.129 --> 03:14:09.270]  Now they're sticking in
[03:14:09.970 --> 03:14:15.613]  The Orwellian Truth Department, okay, that's going to put out fact-based narratives.
[03:14:15.613 --> 03:14:21.936]  And of course, this is all going to save us from foreigners, using fear of others.
[03:14:21.936 --> 03:14:24.257]  You know, the Ausländer, that's the way the Germans did it.
[03:14:24.257 --> 03:14:25.698]  That's the way Adolf Hitler did it.
[03:14:25.698 --> 03:14:26.978]  You know, the foreigner.
[03:14:26.978 --> 03:14:28.639]  Got to save us from the foreigners.
[03:14:28.639 --> 03:14:30.460]  So they're going to set up the State Department.
[03:14:30.460 --> 03:14:34.442]  They're going to coordinate and synchronize counter-propaganda efforts.
[03:14:34.442 --> 03:14:36.523]  Well, those are actually propaganda efforts, aren't they?
[03:14:37.023 --> 03:14:38.144]  They're not truth.
[03:14:38.144 --> 03:14:41.766]  They're going to be the ones to determine what is fact and what is fake.
[03:14:41.766 --> 03:14:46.490]  And they're going to fund this, guess what, through contracts to NGOs.
[03:14:46.490 --> 03:14:47.510]  Does that sound familiar?
[03:14:47.510 --> 03:14:52.474]  That's the way George Soros operates in his color revolutions, is through NGOs.
[03:14:52.992 --> 03:14:57.014]  And of course, it's also the way George Soros operates, to delegitimize elections.
[03:14:57.014 --> 03:14:59.374]  That's where the color revolutions always began.
[03:14:59.374 --> 03:15:05.497]  We've been saying this from right after the election, as soon as they started the riots, we said, oh, this looks familiar, doesn't it?
[03:15:05.497 --> 03:15:13.680]  Getting irate, ignorant, useful idiots, college students typically, because that's the best way to describe most of the college students, using them
[03:15:14.620 --> 03:15:18.943]  To start a revolution and to say that the election is not legitimate.
[03:15:18.943 --> 03:15:25.928]  So they've moved from riots to recounts and now they're moving to the electoral college saying, well, you know, we didn't like that electoral college.
[03:15:25.928 --> 03:15:27.109]  We just wanted to have a direct election.
[03:15:27.109 --> 03:15:29.810]  But now we're going to throw out the votes of the general people.
[03:15:29.810 --> 03:15:30.531]  Listen to what they're saying.
[03:15:30.531 --> 03:15:34.273]  They're going to fund and train local journalists.
[03:15:34.273 --> 03:15:35.574]  They're going to provide grants.
[03:15:35.574 --> 03:15:36.535]  This is State Department.
[03:15:37.200 --> 03:15:47.726]  They're going to provide grants and contracts to NGOs, to civil society organizations, to think tanks, to private sector companies, to media organizations and other experts outside the U.S.
[03:15:47.726 --> 03:15:50.867]  government, but people who will be part of the U.S.
[03:15:50.867 --> 03:15:52.568]  government's propaganda expert.
[03:15:52.568 --> 03:15:57.991]  They are going to privatize, it's going to be a public-private partnership for propaganda.
[03:15:58.638 --> 03:15:59.998]  That's precisely what this is, folks.
[03:15:59.998 --> 03:16:01.099]  You want to know what it is?
[03:16:01.099 --> 03:16:02.479]  That's what it is.
[03:16:02.479 --> 03:16:05.080]  That's the thing we have to watch out for when it comes to our infrastructure.
[03:16:05.080 --> 03:16:09.821]  These private-public partnerships, which is just a fancy name for crony capitalism.
[03:16:09.821 --> 03:16:13.943]  Well, what they're going to do is they're going to create a private-public partnership for propaganda.
[03:16:13.943 --> 03:16:15.723]  The PPPP.
[03:16:15.723 --> 03:16:17.144]  That's what it's really going to be.
[03:16:17.144 --> 03:16:19.644]  Let's just talk about it and understand that's where this is.
[03:16:19.644 --> 03:16:25.186]  And let's understand that this is not a reaction to the hack of the DNC email.
[03:16:26.297 --> 03:16:28.659]  This has been in development for multiple years.
[03:16:28.659 --> 03:16:31.041]  This has been in development since before I came to InfoWars.
[03:16:31.041 --> 03:16:32.763]  And I've been here for four years.
[03:16:32.763 --> 03:16:43.252]  And then it hit the big time in 2013 when they repealed the Smith-Munk Act, which authorized Voice of America and these other propaganda organizations, but said, you're not going to put that fake crap here in America.
[03:16:43.252 --> 03:16:46.334]  But now they want the fake crap here in America.
[03:16:46.334 --> 03:16:47.996]  They want to fund it big time.
[03:16:47.996 --> 03:16:48.736]  Big league.
[03:16:48.736 --> 03:16:49.397]  Okay?
[03:16:49.397 --> 03:16:50.198]  Big league.
[03:16:50.198 --> 03:16:51.799]  Let's go to some of your comments here.
[03:16:51.799 --> 03:16:53.600]  Let's talk to Chris in Virginia.
[03:16:53.600 --> 03:16:54.081]  Chris, go ahead.
[03:16:56.149 --> 03:17:04.236]  Yeah, I wanted to talk about conflict of interest because I have never heard so much talk of conflict of interest.
[03:17:04.236 --> 03:17:12.703]  That's why it makes me, when they criticize whoever Trump picks for cabinet, that's what lets me know that people are actually going to do their job.
[03:17:12.703 --> 03:17:13.844]  If somebody that they would
[03:17:14.523 --> 03:17:26.528]  Accept or like wholeheartedly that I will have a problem with because it seems right to me that they're just having a sit because they know these people are finally going to put the money that's been going to these fat cats in the right place.
[03:17:26.528 --> 03:17:29.369]  And I think that's a big problem that's really got them all scared.
[03:17:30.117 --> 03:17:35.480]  Well, that's the one thing that they can say about somebody who actually knows something about the area that they would be regulating.
[03:17:35.480 --> 03:17:46.748]  Now, of course, we've seen with the Attorney General that was put in place at the EPA, they're not going to be able to get conflict of interest against him because he's not really come from a business background.
[03:17:46.748 --> 03:17:51.210]  But it's very important to have people who actually know how the world works rather than a community organizer.
[03:17:51.210 --> 03:17:52.111]  And I thought it was interesting.
[03:17:52.111 --> 03:17:53.772]  You talk about conflict of interest.
[03:17:53.772 --> 03:17:56.414]  Rand Paul came out this weekend when he was interviewed and he said, hey,
[03:17:57.254 --> 03:18:07.018]  I don't think it's really fair to require Donald Trump to try in a fire sale to diverse himself of all of these many different industries that he's involved in.
[03:18:07.018 --> 03:18:10.619]  He goes, people knew that he owned all these companies when they voted for him.
[03:18:10.619 --> 03:18:11.659]  I mean, how do you feel about that?
[03:18:11.659 --> 03:18:17.101]  I think that is going to be a major line of attack on Donald Trump once he becomes president.
[03:18:17.101 --> 03:18:21.943]  They're going to come after him, as you pointed out, with conflict of interest on this and conflict of interest on that.
[03:18:21.943 --> 03:18:24.524]  They're going to be finding a conflict of interest in everything that he does.
[03:18:26.147 --> 03:18:28.229]  Yeah, I totally agree with that.
[03:18:28.229 --> 03:18:31.651]  It just seems like, to me, like they're just making a big fuss out of nothing.
[03:18:31.651 --> 03:18:33.773]  You know, we never had anything like this.
[03:18:33.773 --> 03:18:41.979]  It just seems like, to me, it's easy to tell that a lot of people that don't want him to let the money go to the right places that they need to be.
[03:18:41.979 --> 03:18:44.281]  And for you personally, keep making them run!
[03:18:45.261 --> 03:18:50.606]  Yeah, they're not going to stop in terms of trying to delegitimize everything that Donald Trump does.
[03:18:50.606 --> 03:18:52.147]  Not only the election, but this.
[03:18:52.147 --> 03:18:53.568]  And this is the way it's going to roll.
[03:18:53.568 --> 03:18:55.971]  I want to take more of your calls in the next segment.
[03:18:55.971 --> 03:19:00.514]  Again, that number is going to be 800-259-9231.
[03:19:00.514 --> 03:19:02.936]  And remind you that we have massive sales.
[03:19:02.936 --> 03:19:04.378]  This is the way we support our operation.
[03:19:04.798 --> 03:19:09.601]  So that we're not held hostage by boycotts from Kellogg's and others.
[03:19:09.601 --> 03:19:16.224]  We offer you the very best products and right now we've got free shipping storewide and we have discounts up to 50%.
[03:19:16.224 --> 03:19:18.666]  That's the way we fund our operation.
[03:19:18.666 --> 03:19:20.406]  We really appreciate your support.
[03:19:20.406 --> 03:19:24.269]  It keeps us independent of these people and we are the tip of the spear.
[03:19:24.269 --> 03:19:25.249]  You understand?
[03:19:25.249 --> 03:19:27.770]  They started this whole thing years ago.
[03:19:27.770 --> 03:19:30.212]  They started it before the election and it wouldn't be
[03:19:30.872 --> 03:19:32.433]  About Donald Trump at this moment.
[03:19:32.433 --> 03:19:33.813]  It would simply be about us.

[03:24:12.779 --> 03:24:14.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:14.080 --> 03:24:15.581]  I'm David Knight, your host this hour.
[03:24:15.581 --> 03:24:21.445]  I'm going to go back to our callers, Mike Joshua, Bob, Mike, Antoine, hang on, I'm going to get to you in just a moment.
[03:24:21.445 --> 03:24:26.588]  As I was mentioning before we went to the break, now is the time that we really need your support.
[03:24:27.409 --> 03:24:33.212]  We are taking the brunt of the attacks, as you saw last week, in terms of the attacks on free speech.
[03:24:33.212 --> 03:24:35.272]  This is an all-out attack on free speech.
[03:24:35.272 --> 03:24:41.035]  I don't think this had anything to do, as I've pointed out many times, this is something that's been rolling out for years.
[03:24:41.035 --> 03:24:43.816]  This was the time they were really going to make this fall into line.
[03:24:43.816 --> 03:24:45.897]  Because Hillary Clinton didn't win.
[03:24:45.897 --> 03:24:48.478]  Because you didn't buy their phony narrative.
[03:24:48.478 --> 03:24:49.519]  Because Donald Trump won.
[03:24:49.519 --> 03:24:51.840]  He is now taking the brunt of this.
[03:24:51.840 --> 03:24:56.902]  They're trying to delegitimize his election, and they're trying to delegitimize the press.
[03:24:57.222 --> 03:24:57.983]  And social media.
[03:24:57.983 --> 03:25:02.147]  Talking about how social media was weaponized in this last election.
[03:25:02.147 --> 03:25:03.509]  That means you folks.
[03:25:03.509 --> 03:25:04.369]  They're coming after you.
[03:25:04.369 --> 03:25:06.952]  They want to shut down your speech.
[03:25:06.952 --> 03:25:08.333]  They want to shut down our speech.
[03:25:08.333 --> 03:25:09.515]  They want to shut down InfoWars.
[03:25:09.515 --> 03:25:10.676]  So we need your support.
[03:25:10.676 --> 03:25:12.257]  We're grateful for your support.
[03:25:12.257 --> 03:25:19.765]  And we have now taken all of the 2016 Christmas Super Sale specials live now at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:25:20.726 --> 03:25:23.630]  And let me tell you, these are massive discounts up to 50% off.
[03:25:23.630 --> 03:25:25.452]  Let me just give you a few examples of this.
[03:25:25.452 --> 03:25:27.274]  Living Defense, 30% off.
[03:25:27.274 --> 03:25:30.958]  Silver Bullet, colloidal silver, 50% off Silver Bullet.

[03:25:36.124 --> 03:25:39.749]  That's very essential, especially this time of year when you don't get
[03:25:40.189 --> 03:25:47.430]  The natural vitamin D that you would normally get with sun exposure because of winter, because you're indoors more, because you're more bundled up.
[03:25:47.430 --> 03:25:50.911]  This is very important to keep up your vitamin D3 levels.
[03:25:50.911 --> 03:25:54.312]  And again, it's a very good source of vitamin D3.
[03:25:54.312 --> 03:25:58.252]  Not the synthetic stuff, not the D2 that you get with a lot of supplements.
[03:25:58.252 --> 03:26:00.913]  Winter sun, vitamin D, 25% off.
[03:26:00.913 --> 03:26:02.113]  Survival Shield, X2, nascent iodine, 30% off.
[03:26:02.113 --> 03:26:02.573]  30% off bio-true selenium.

[03:26:12.915 --> 03:26:13.395]  Everything.
[03:26:13.395 --> 03:26:14.136]  Free shipping.
[03:26:14.136 --> 03:26:15.916]  That's our Christmas Super Sale.
[03:26:15.916 --> 03:26:19.257]  We have now taken it live at Infowarslife.com.
[03:26:19.257 --> 03:26:21.497]  This is a 360 win, folks.
[03:26:21.497 --> 03:26:23.157]  We have to fight this together.
[03:26:23.157 --> 03:26:30.339]  Just as we have to support Donald Trump as he is being attacked with this false narrative about the election.
[03:26:30.339 --> 03:26:31.619]  I just cannot believe
[03:26:32.239 --> 03:26:37.142]  How they're using and abusing and misrepresenting the electoral college is absolutely amazing.
[03:26:37.142 --> 03:26:38.662]  But I want to get your comments.
[03:26:38.662 --> 03:26:40.964]  Let's go to Mike in England.
[03:26:40.964 --> 03:26:43.145]  Go ahead, Mike.
[03:26:43.145 --> 03:26:43.985]  Hello, David.
[03:26:43.985 --> 03:26:45.206]  Hey.
[03:26:45.206 --> 03:26:46.247]  Hey, there's great analysis.
[03:26:46.247 --> 03:26:49.468]  I always look forward to your opening analysis.
[03:26:49.468 --> 03:26:50.669]  It's great.
[03:26:50.669 --> 03:26:52.950]  I spoke actually been a couple months now.
[03:26:52.950 --> 03:26:58.193]  I spoke to the presidential press office for Putin, and they said they'd be open to an interview.
[03:26:58.997 --> 03:27:01.038]  And you guys would be the perfect ones to do it.
[03:27:01.038 --> 03:27:05.579]  And I think this is part of what Alex was asking earlier, you know, what do we do to go on the offense?
[03:27:05.579 --> 03:27:20.864]  I think going on the offense is actually putting Putin's face on American TVs and having an interview on an American platform where people can actually see him and hear him because he's a statesman in contrast to the jokers and clowns that we have.
[03:27:22.493 --> 03:27:24.675]  Yeah, it would be interesting.
[03:27:24.675 --> 03:27:36.161]  I know when they asked Putin about the training exercises that they said were going on right at the border, you know, this massive build-up of NATO exercises.
[03:27:36.161 --> 03:27:37.602]  Well, this is just training.
[03:27:37.602 --> 03:27:38.942]  There's no message behind this.
[03:27:38.942 --> 03:27:42.144]  And he just started laughing, like, come on, I'm not that stupid.
[03:27:42.144 --> 03:27:43.425]  Nobody is that stupid.
[03:27:43.425 --> 03:27:47.507]  We understand when that's being done that it is intimidation.
[03:27:47.507 --> 03:27:48.788]  And, you know, quite frankly,
[03:27:49.528 --> 03:28:02.496]  Right after the election, I covered this, there was a town, it was a Daily Mail story, there was a town in Russia and they started, the people there, started a petition wanting to rename a street to Donald Trump.
[03:28:02.496 --> 03:28:06.079]  Interestingly enough, the name of the street now is Godless Street.
[03:28:06.639 --> 03:28:12.881]  It was named that by the communists because they were proudly atheist and they wanted to put that out there so they named the street Godless Street.
[03:28:12.881 --> 03:28:15.903]  So they wanted to change the name from Godless Street to Donald Trump Street.
[03:28:15.903 --> 03:28:16.763]  That was their petition.
[03:28:16.763 --> 03:28:17.803]  Why?
[03:28:17.803 --> 03:28:27.267]  Because they realized that the Obama administration, that Hillary Clinton, that the globalists, both Republicans and Democrats, had put a loaded gun to their head.
[03:28:28.027 --> 03:28:35.768]  They're trying to push, not only for a Russian reset, which is a reset of the Cold War, but they wanted to push right up to the brink of World War III.
[03:28:37.111 --> 03:28:39.712]  And they feel like, they understand what it's like.
[03:28:39.712 --> 03:28:41.093]  They're not naive like Americans.
[03:28:41.093 --> 03:28:45.315]  They felt the full brunt of World War II in their country.
[03:28:45.315 --> 03:28:47.256]  You know, the closest that we got was Pearl Harbor.
[03:28:47.256 --> 03:28:51.278]  And that was something that really, we just passed that anniversary.
[03:28:51.278 --> 03:28:53.519]  Americans, that had a big effect on them.
[03:28:53.519 --> 03:28:55.400]  I remember my parents talking about that.
[03:28:55.400 --> 03:28:59.462]  That was the time that they were just a young married couple when that happened.
[03:28:59.462 --> 03:29:02.383]  And my dad then signed up to the military.
[03:29:02.383 --> 03:29:04.064]  That was something that they lived through.
[03:29:04.064 --> 03:29:05.665]  But that was not anything at all.
[03:29:06.125 --> 03:29:08.446]  Like what the Russian people lived through in World War II.
[03:29:08.446 --> 03:29:10.647]  So they took it very seriously.
[03:29:10.647 --> 03:29:16.110]  All of this beating the drums of war that were done by Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[03:29:16.110 --> 03:29:18.231]  And they believe that they dodged the bullet.
[03:29:18.231 --> 03:29:22.993]  I also was interviewed by a Russian press organization, Tsargrad TV.
[03:29:22.993 --> 03:29:23.774]  And they felt the same way.
[03:29:23.774 --> 03:29:26.215]  They were ecstatic that Donald Trump had won.
[03:29:26.215 --> 03:29:29.817]  Well, he hasn't become president yet, as Michael Moore pointed out.
[03:29:30.277 --> 03:29:40.521]  We have to understand what their tactics are and I hope he will directly confront their tactics and talk about it just as he did the attempt to overthrow the election at the primary level.
[03:29:40.521 --> 03:29:42.002]  That's what they're trying again now.
[03:29:42.002 --> 03:29:45.303]  It didn't work then, I don't think it's going to work now, but we're going to have to directly confront it.
[03:29:45.303 --> 03:29:47.044]  Stay with us, we'll be back with more of your phone calls.
[03:29:47.044 --> 03:29:49.004]  I'm David Knight.
[03:29:49.004 --> 03:29:52.926]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.926 --> 03:29:55.607]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.705 --> 03:30:03.528]  Why is the CIA pushing this ridiculous conspiracy theory?
[03:30:03.528 --> 03:30:09.733]  Reports of Russian officials intervening in the American presidential election have been industriously circulated for months.
[03:30:09.733 --> 03:30:18.760]  The FBI, DHS, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence are all looking at the same allegations, and all of the agencies came up with the same foregone conclusion.
[03:30:18.760 --> 03:30:22.943]  Vladimir Putin's government deliberately interfered with America's presidential election.
[03:30:23.103 --> 03:30:34.674]  The laughable insinuation was reiterated this morning in an article published in The Hill, attacking President-elect Donald Trump for casting doubt on their assessment, concluding that Russia intervened in the election to help him win the White House.
[03:30:34.674 --> 03:30:35.295]  Trump tweeted out,
[03:30:40.680 --> 03:30:46.786]  Keep in mind, this is the same CIA that asserted false claims against Saddam Hussein and led us into the invasion of Iraq.
[03:30:46.786 --> 03:30:53.813]  With a track record like that, one must take their assessments with a serious grain of salt and question the motivation of these agencies.
[03:30:53.813 --> 03:30:56.196]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for InfoWars.com.

[03:31:59.352 --> 03:32:02.015]  I want to tell you about a brand new off-the-grid product.
[03:32:02.015 --> 03:32:04.157]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[03:32:04.157 --> 03:32:12.986]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house, like small refrigerators, to keep your food from spoiling.
[03:32:12.986 --> 03:32:15.508]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[03:32:15.508 --> 03:32:16.229]  It's mobile.
[03:32:16.229 --> 03:32:20.914]  To jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[03:32:21.374 --> 03:32:25.096]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity.
[03:32:25.096 --> 03:32:28.518]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[03:32:28.518 --> 03:32:29.538]  A true innovation.
[03:32:29.538 --> 03:32:31.619]  I have never seen anything like this.
[03:32:31.619 --> 03:32:33.340]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[03:32:33.340 --> 03:32:35.861]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[03:32:35.861 --> 03:32:37.602]  It's even a great Christmas idea.
[03:32:37.782 --> 03:32:38.262]  I don't think so.
[03:33:07.023 --> 03:33:11.112]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:33:11.112 --> 03:33:12.815]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:15.800 --> 03:33:17.141]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.141 --> 03:33:20.162]  I'm David Knight, your host for the rest of this fourth hour.
[03:33:20.162 --> 03:33:36.147]  We're taking your phone calls, and if you want to call in and comment on what's going on with the attacks, about the legitimacy of the election, the electoral college, or comment on the cabinet picks that we've seen Donald Trump pick so far, or some of the ones that are coming up, that number is 800-259-9231.
[03:33:36.147 --> 03:33:36.567]  Again, that's 800-259-9231.
[03:33:36.567 --> 03:33:38.388]  Let's go to Joshua in Georgia.
[03:33:38.388 --> 03:33:39.088]  Go ahead, Joshua.
[03:33:47.150 --> 03:33:52.314]  Yes, thank you for taking my call, David, and God bless you guys for everything you guys are doing.
[03:33:52.314 --> 03:34:05.165]  Wanted to talk about this illusion that's being put out by, I guess, what we like to call the Cuckservatives that are continually being put on CNN, ABC.
[03:34:05.165 --> 03:34:13.352]  You know, back in the day, in 2009 and 2010, I used to listen to Glenn Beck on Fox News, and then I was introduced to you guys by a buddy of mine.
[03:34:14.183 --> 03:34:16.426]  And I've been listening to you guys ever since.
[03:34:16.426 --> 03:34:21.996]  I saw that Glenn Beck, he really utilized a lot of your information almost verbatim.
[03:34:21.996 --> 03:34:24.721]  Oh yeah, there was a guy back when we, when I first started here, we had a...
[03:34:25.855 --> 03:34:27.796]  We had a film contest that Alex put out.
[03:34:27.796 --> 03:34:28.576]  If you remember, it was about $100,000.
[03:34:28.576 --> 03:34:41.361]  There was a guy, I think it was out of Australia, and he basically put a clip of Alex saying something with a date, and then Glenn Beck saying it like six months or a year or two years later, exactly the same thing, put them back to back.
[03:34:41.361 --> 03:34:43.102]  It was pretty amazing to document that.
[03:34:43.102 --> 03:34:45.843]  But of course, Rolling Stone did the same thing as well.
[03:34:45.843 --> 03:34:46.403]  Go ahead.
[03:34:46.403 --> 03:34:47.383]  Yes.
[03:34:47.383 --> 03:34:47.864]  Yes.
[03:34:47.864 --> 03:34:53.406]  And so now Glenn Beck has changed his course.
[03:34:53.406 --> 03:34:54.166]  Obviously, obviously,
[03:34:54.733 --> 03:35:20.574]  He keeps attacking Alex Jones, he attacks Breitbart, attacks Drudge, says he's a conservative, but now is going on ABC and CNN and apologizing, saying he's made mistakes, and to beware of the alt-right, and to beware of Richard Spencer, saying that him and Steve Bannon are white nationalists, and he's quoting from the LA Times, he's saying he has all this documentation about them, and really
[03:35:21.147 --> 03:35:25.129]  Putting a lot of misinformation out there, but I can't verify stuff he's saying.
[03:35:25.129 --> 03:35:27.711]  Do you know anything about this Richard Spencer guy?
[03:35:27.711 --> 03:35:31.833]  No, I don't know anything about him, and I don't like the label alt-right.
[03:35:31.833 --> 03:35:36.055]  I don't accept that label for myself.
[03:35:36.055 --> 03:35:39.778]  I'm a libertarian, actually a paleo-libertarian, if you want to get more specific about it.
[03:35:39.778 --> 03:35:43.960]  Hey, I wonder what Glenn Beck thinks about his false messiah, Ted Cruz.
[03:35:43.960 --> 03:35:45.561]  You know, false messiah Ted Cruz
[03:35:46.141 --> 03:35:48.923]  Voted for the NDAA on Friday.
[03:35:48.923 --> 03:35:55.547]  See, we've seen, haven't we, the Sixth Amendment, our due process amendment, shredded by the NDAA.
[03:35:55.547 --> 03:36:05.194]  When it first was put in there, what was that, in 2012, I think, they put that in there to say you're going to have indefinite detention by the military without trial.
[03:36:05.194 --> 03:36:09.457]  That was something that a few people spoke out against, but not Ted Cruz anymore.
[03:36:09.457 --> 03:36:15.541]  And now when they come out and say we're going to turn the State Department into an official propaganda unit,
[03:36:16.321 --> 03:36:24.027]  And we're going to let them allocate money to preferred private organizations and NGOs, and Ted Cruz votes for that as well.
[03:36:24.027 --> 03:36:31.813]  So he's now voted for the shredding of the Sixth Amendment, the shredding of the First Amendment, and this is a guy who said he was all about the Constitution.
[03:36:31.813 --> 03:36:37.298]  What a fraud, and what a fraud Glenn Beck is for saying that he had a word from God
[03:36:37.918 --> 03:36:42.761]  That God had chosen Ted Cruz to be president, the false messiah.
[03:36:42.761 --> 03:36:45.962]  So I've seen this from Glenn Beck.
[03:36:45.962 --> 03:36:50.585]  I saw the lies that he was putting out about what happened at the Bundy standoff.
[03:36:50.585 --> 03:37:04.853]  I saw how he tried to apply the label of sovereign citizen to Cliven Bundy, who had absolutely no idea that that was a loaded term that had been loaded up by law enforcement to sound like he was a dangerous revolutionary.
[03:37:05.917 --> 03:37:15.145]  He tried to throw him under the bus with that, and now he's out there using loaded terms like the alt-right trying to paint other people in the media as racist.
[03:37:15.145 --> 03:37:18.728]  This is the tactic of Glenn Beck.
[03:37:18.728 --> 03:37:23.873]  This guy has been a phony conservative, a phony libertarian, a phony Christian from day one.
[03:37:23.993 --> 03:37:31.898]  Everything about that man is phony and a lie and so I'm not surprised at all that he's out there whoring himself out to the mainstream media.
[03:37:31.898 --> 03:37:36.981]  Anybody that will put him on because his media empire is collapsing and he's looking for a job.
[03:37:36.981 --> 03:37:38.041]  That's about all I got.
[03:37:38.041 --> 03:37:39.242]  So you want to say anything else Joshua?
[03:37:41.577 --> 03:37:44.682]  No, I would love to hear your viewpoints.
[03:37:44.682 --> 03:37:46.444]  I know you guys really do the in-depth research.
[03:37:46.444 --> 03:37:58.620]  He keeps bringing up a gentleman named Richard Spencer, having a relationship with Breitbart and Steve Bannon, and that's where he's really trying to hone in on the alt-right being this racist thing, and he's really selling this thing on a daily basis.
[03:37:59.280 --> 03:38:07.228]  If you guys were able to potentially put a piece together on that, just so I can send that out to my conservative friends that keep trying to debate me, that would be awesome.
[03:38:07.228 --> 03:38:13.514]  Well, I know that some of the people who are white nationalists have proudly embraced the label alt-right.
[03:38:14.275 --> 03:38:20.019]  And I haven't seen any definition of it, but I know that's the way that they're trying to paint everybody who takes that label.
[03:38:20.019 --> 03:38:22.640]  I'm not alternate, and I'm not right-wing.
[03:38:22.640 --> 03:38:29.424]  When I was a libertarian, I took a great deal of exception to people who called me a right-wing nut.
[03:38:29.424 --> 03:38:30.465]  I said, I'm not right-wing.
[03:38:33.401 --> 03:38:37.743]  I reject your false left-right dichotomy, and I'm not a nut either, okay?
[03:38:37.743 --> 03:38:41.885]  We back up what we have to say here, unlike Glenn Beck, but we know exactly what he's about.
[03:38:41.885 --> 03:38:43.987]  Let's go to Bob in Pennsylvania.
[03:38:43.987 --> 03:38:46.248]  Bob, go ahead.
[03:38:46.248 --> 03:38:47.609]  It's great to talk to you.
[03:38:47.609 --> 03:38:55.453]  I have an interesting story about that demagogue, Glenn Beck, but first I wanted to talk about something a little bit different.
[03:38:55.453 --> 03:39:01.757]  I consider myself a foot soldier in the information war, and as a foot soldier,
[03:39:02.435 --> 03:39:09.961]  I know that I'm not always going to get direction from above, so I have to figure out what I can do on my own.
[03:39:09.961 --> 03:39:21.430]  And what I did this morning was I called my Democratic congressman and wanted to know what they're going to do about the people that are trying to commit treason in the Democratic Party.
[03:39:21.430 --> 03:39:27.014]  I think we have to put pressure on Congress wherever we have an opportunity.
[03:39:27.014 --> 03:39:31.057]  And I'm also going to be making up my sign, Trump is my president.
[03:39:31.770 --> 03:39:39.192]  I live close enough to D.C., maybe five hours, I'm going to be driving down there and I will be on the steps of Congress now and then.
[03:39:39.192 --> 03:39:40.733]  Well, I think you hit the nail right on the head.
[03:39:40.733 --> 03:39:56.118]  Remember how they were saying before the election, when we were talking about concerns that we had about electronic voting machines, concerns we had about voter fraud, allowing people who are not legitimate voters to come in and vote, and they were shutting these things down, we said, wait, you shouldn't be doing that.
[03:39:56.798 --> 03:40:01.060]  And they said, how dare you question the legitimacy of the election?
[03:40:01.060 --> 03:40:02.901]  That is treason if you do that sort of thing.
[03:40:02.901 --> 03:40:04.041]  And now, who is doing it?
[03:40:04.041 --> 03:40:05.082]  They're doing it.
[03:40:05.082 --> 03:40:09.584]  At the same time, immediately after the election, they were coming out and saying, oh, this is horrible.
[03:40:09.584 --> 03:40:16.527]  We have an electoral college, and Hillary Clinton is winning by half a million, by a million, by a million and a half, it just kept going up, right?
[03:40:16.527 --> 03:40:20.029]  Because it was being padded by these corrupt jurisdictions.
[03:40:20.029 --> 03:40:23.731]  And that's precisely what the electoral college was set up to avoid.
[03:40:24.531 --> 03:40:29.559]  And so now they're saying, oh, we want the Electoral College to overturn what the voters did.
[03:40:29.559 --> 03:40:34.005]  First they were complaining that the Electoral College was going to overturn what the voters did.
[03:40:34.005 --> 03:40:38.051]  Now they're saying they want the Electoral College to overturn what the voters did.
[03:40:38.051 --> 03:40:39.814]  They changed their position.
[03:40:40.655 --> 03:40:42.316]  To get what they want.
[03:40:42.316 --> 03:40:45.758]  And there's no consistency in what they say, and there's no truth in what they say.
[03:40:45.758 --> 03:40:47.719]  And of course, it's all politically motivated.
[03:40:47.719 --> 03:40:53.002]  We see the electors who are now calling for a briefing by the CIA.
[03:40:53.002 --> 03:40:57.765]  It's the daughter of Nancy Pelosi that's part of this group that's calling for it.
[03:40:58.405 --> 03:41:00.126]  Okay, that's the way this thing is rolling out.
[03:41:00.126 --> 03:41:08.932]  It is nothing other than an attempt to discredit the election, and they will say one thing this week, and they will say 180 degrees different next week.
[03:41:08.932 --> 03:41:11.854]  They'll completely switch and reverse their opinion.
[03:41:11.854 --> 03:41:16.257]  Anything that they can to disrupt the election, to delegitimize Donald Trump's election.
[03:41:16.257 --> 03:41:19.039]  And that's why he needs to go on the attack.
[03:41:19.039 --> 03:41:21.240]  He needs to address this directly.
[03:41:21.240 --> 03:41:24.342]  We've seen this happen before at the primary level, and they're doing it again.
[03:41:24.342 --> 03:41:26.984]  This is a very dangerous thing, and as I said before,
[03:41:27.524 --> 03:41:32.747]  I think they believe they can get away with it or they would not be coming out and saying this in the way that they are.
[03:41:32.747 --> 03:41:37.109]  People in the CIA coming out and saying that, that's a very amazing thing.
[03:41:37.109 --> 03:41:38.510]  Thank you, Bob.
[03:41:38.510 --> 03:41:39.711]  Was there anything else that you wanted to say?
[03:41:39.711 --> 03:41:45.034]  Yeah, we have the greatest country in the world and now is not the time to sit back.
[03:41:45.034 --> 03:41:52.158]  If you can think of something to do to put the word out, sign Alex's petition or whatever,
[03:41:53.577 --> 03:41:58.924]  Now's the time to act, but I wanted to tell you something about Mr. Glenn Beck.
[03:41:58.924 --> 03:42:05.231]  Years, I think when his career was first starting, he wrote a book called The Christmas Sweater.
[03:42:05.231 --> 03:42:09.015]  And it was sort of like a book on his life.
[03:42:09.015 --> 03:42:14.001]  In that book, he tells a story about how his mother was killed in a car crash.
[03:42:15.003 --> 03:42:16.504]  Which never happened.
[03:42:16.504 --> 03:42:20.127]  That will tell you how low of a scum this person is.
[03:42:20.127 --> 03:42:21.848]  He is the worst of the worst.
[03:42:21.848 --> 03:42:22.689]  Yeah.
[03:42:22.689 --> 03:42:23.549]  Mr. Fake News.
[03:42:23.549 --> 03:42:24.550]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:42:24.550 --> 03:42:25.070]  That's amazing.
[03:42:25.070 --> 03:42:27.212]  Of course, he does love his sweaters, doesn't he?
[03:42:27.212 --> 03:42:31.155]  He likes to get that, who was the guy on public TV?
[03:42:31.155 --> 03:42:32.055]  Mr. Rogers.
[03:42:32.055 --> 03:42:33.997]  He likes that Mr. Rogers vibe going.
[03:42:33.997 --> 03:42:35.538]  He tries to get that going all the time.
[03:42:35.538 --> 03:42:36.438]  Thank you, Bob.
[03:42:36.438 --> 03:42:38.180]  You know, when we look at this election,
[03:42:39.298 --> 03:42:51.675]  And one of the things I think is unfortunate about this, I said after the election, I said let's do, continue on and look at the specifics that Donald Trump, that we were talking about before the election.
[03:42:51.675 --> 03:42:53.978]  Let's make sure that we've got legitimate voters.
[03:42:54.659 --> 03:43:03.006]  Let's make sure that we don't open ourselves up to massive fraud by manipulation of voting machines, by manipulation of the vote totals.
[03:43:03.006 --> 03:43:05.328]  And of course, we've had that type of thing happen.
[03:43:05.328 --> 03:43:21.423]  Let's make sure that we have the mechanisms in place to do an audit of an election, which we've had the Texas Director of Elections here shut down ever since he became the Director of Elections, to shut down the ability to do a recount if it's coming from one of these electronic voting machines.
[03:43:22.564 --> 03:43:23.584]  Let's take a look at this.
[03:43:23.584 --> 03:43:27.828]  Now is a time as victors that we can come in and say this.
[03:43:27.828 --> 03:43:31.011]  Look, we won the election, but we want to make the election more honest.
[03:43:31.011 --> 03:43:34.794]  Let's use that and not be accused of being sore losers.
[03:43:34.794 --> 03:43:38.097]  But what we've seen with Jill Stein is that she has focused
[03:43:38.977 --> 03:43:45.582]  on this in a way that is really delegitimizing the concerns about voter fraud, about election fraud.
[03:43:45.582 --> 03:44:00.092]  And that's one of the things that I'm most angry about with Jill Stein, is that she is giving a black eye to genuine efforts to try to correct the elements that have been put in that systematically invite fraud, whether it happens or not.
[03:44:00.092 --> 03:44:01.493]  She says, well, we think it might have happened.
[03:44:01.493 --> 03:44:03.494]  It's like, yeah, we think it can happen too.
[03:44:03.494 --> 03:44:05.215]  So let's do something about that.
[03:44:05.215 --> 03:44:06.356]  But instead she used it
[03:44:06.836 --> 03:44:09.577]  She became a shill for Hillary.
[03:44:09.577 --> 03:44:13.379]  As I point out, Jill the shill went up the hill to carrying Hillary's water.
[03:44:13.379 --> 03:44:15.099]  She's fallen down now, okay?
[03:44:15.099 --> 03:44:16.640]  She's broken her crown.
[03:44:16.640 --> 03:44:29.685]  And she has, the results of this is that she's delegitimized genuine concerns and real things that we should be doing to make sure that we have fair, honest, auditable elections in the future.
[03:44:29.685 --> 03:44:33.967]  So she, I think, really abused that position there where she didn't really have any standing.
[03:44:33.967 --> 03:44:35.628]  Let's go to Mike in Indiana.
[03:44:35.628 --> 03:44:36.088]  Go ahead, Mike.
[03:44:38.223 --> 03:44:40.064]  Hey David, thanks for taking my call.
[03:44:40.064 --> 03:44:41.725]  Thank you for calling.
[03:44:41.725 --> 03:44:43.606]  Yes, and can you hear me?
[03:44:43.606 --> 03:44:45.787]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:44:45.787 --> 03:44:56.892]  When I wrote my first pamphlet back in the early 80s of billions for the bankers, debts for the people, I was awakened of what the global agenda was.
[03:44:56.892 --> 03:44:59.954]  And just like anybody else, I kind of like fell asleep
[03:45:00.743 --> 03:45:08.930]  And a good friend of mine gave me one of the Alex's CDs, and I listened to it, and I've been awake ever since, and I'm gonna stay awake.
[03:45:08.930 --> 03:45:10.511]  And you know something?
[03:45:10.511 --> 03:45:19.499]  I'm actually from Northwest Indiana, which is a stone's throw from Chicago, which is probably the worst corrupt part of the state.
[03:45:19.499 --> 03:45:28.386]  You know, we have a bigger lead problem here than they do in Flint, Michigan, but you don't see anything that on the national news network and stuff like that.
[03:45:30.017 --> 03:45:30.358]  Yeah.
[03:45:30.358 --> 03:45:35.406]  So, you know, and I mean, the news media is really fake.
[03:45:36.906 --> 03:45:46.193]  Well, and you know, when you're talking about the problems that you got there being close to Chicago, I mean, you know how they've been involved in rigging the presidential election in the past, or for JFK and so forth.
[03:45:46.193 --> 03:45:49.196]  That was what the Electoral College, part of what it's about.
[03:45:49.196 --> 03:46:01.786]  It's about making sure that we have a regional representation for everybody, that you don't have your vote if you live outside of New York, Chicago, or L.A., that your vote is not completely eradicated
[03:46:02.446 --> 03:46:12.992]  By a dishonest, corrupt, big city machine like we see in Chicago where they can continue to pad the votes for weeks in favor of one candidate.
[03:46:12.992 --> 03:46:13.993]  That's what we don't want to have.
[03:46:13.993 --> 03:46:15.954]  That's why we have the Electoral College.
[03:46:15.954 --> 03:46:23.499]  But then we take it to the next level and we look at what these people are doing and say, hey, I'm here as an elector so I need to be able to make that decision.
[03:46:24.119 --> 03:46:30.222]  It's like, we don't need them to overwrite the votes of the people on a state-by-state basis.
[03:46:30.222 --> 03:46:43.189]  If we had a multi-party democracy, and we had more than two candidates who had a chance of winning in this, then the electors, I think, should represent what the people of the state wanted them to do for at least one ballot, and then they could make a decision.
[03:46:43.189 --> 03:46:45.070]  But we've got a two-person election here.
[03:46:45.530 --> 03:46:51.994]  And so there's nothing for them to do other than be a rubber stamp for what the people said they wanted in an election.
[03:46:51.994 --> 03:46:53.255]  And so, that's my concern.
[03:46:53.255 --> 03:47:01.499]  You're talking about Chicago, and I think that's exhibit A of why we need an electoral college that takes this vote on a state-by-state basis.
[03:47:01.499 --> 03:47:01.940]  Do you agree?
[03:47:01.940 --> 03:47:12.906]  I agree totally, and that's what I was trying to explain to my wife and stuff about the electoral college and stuff like that, how people in large, corrupt cities can't
[03:47:13.391 --> 03:47:16.613]  Overturn any election and stuff like that.
[03:47:16.613 --> 03:47:21.675]  We need the same system that we have right now at the Electoral College.
[03:47:21.675 --> 03:47:25.397]  And that's the best thing we have going right now.
[03:47:25.891 --> 03:47:26.351]  Absolutely.
[03:47:26.351 --> 03:47:35.579]  And so we have a system, and as Donald Trump pointed out, he said, look, if we didn't have the Electoral College, I would have campaigned in only five states, and I would have campaigned differently under different rules.
[03:47:35.579 --> 03:47:37.701]  And see, that's one thing we should all pay attention to.
[03:47:37.701 --> 03:47:43.786]  We don't want to have a situation where instead of him campaigning in essentially 15 states, that would be narrowed down to only five states.
[03:47:43.786 --> 03:47:46.188]  See, that's why you want to have the Electoral College.
[03:47:46.188 --> 03:47:49.851]  But then the other part of it is the fact that the Democrats, when they don't get the results that they want,
[03:47:50.171 --> 03:47:50.832]  Yeah, hello David.
[03:48:10.956 --> 03:48:11.956]  I'm doing good.
[03:48:11.956 --> 03:48:14.998]  So I wanted to talk about, first, Donald Trump.
[03:48:14.998 --> 03:48:19.580]  I like to say, you've got to invest a lot in internet media.
[03:48:19.580 --> 03:48:20.300]  A lot.
[03:48:20.300 --> 03:48:23.502]  Because we have, I mean, that's all there is.
[03:48:23.502 --> 03:48:25.623]  The lies are us.
[03:48:25.623 --> 03:48:26.063]  That's right.
[03:48:26.063 --> 03:48:28.144]  There's a lot of alternative media out there.
[03:48:29.165 --> 03:48:32.508]  There's a lot of stuff being taken over, censored.
[03:48:32.508 --> 03:48:35.110]  You need to basically replace it.
[03:48:35.110 --> 03:48:36.111]  It's very easy.
[03:48:36.111 --> 03:48:47.160]  Think about the fact, Antoine, that the Senate just authorized the State Department to spend $180 million to put out their message to counter us.
[03:48:47.160 --> 03:48:48.361]  That's $180 million.
[03:48:48.361 --> 03:48:52.745]  I mean, how many colloidal silver do we have to sell at 50% off to equal $180 million?
[03:48:54.667 --> 03:48:54.867]  Yeah.
[03:48:54.867 --> 03:48:55.268]  So, um...
[03:49:12.443 --> 03:49:15.085]  Yeah, I have an alternative platform.
[03:49:15.085 --> 03:49:16.045]  I use YouTube.
[03:49:16.045 --> 03:49:17.466]  It's called The Orbiter.
[03:49:17.466 --> 03:49:20.629]  I've seen a lot of stuff and it's all aligning for right now.
[03:49:20.629 --> 03:49:21.569]  Some scary stuff.
[03:49:21.569 --> 03:49:23.530]  I'd say this week is pretty scary.
[03:49:23.530 --> 03:49:27.093]  I hope he can get past all this stuff with the 19th and stuff.
[03:49:29.221 --> 03:49:42.609]  So I'd have to say, yes, there's stuff where a lot of conspiracies where people say that this year is very critical and, you know, martial law could be called as Jade Helm was practiced.
[03:49:42.609 --> 03:49:48.532]  I heard they've been building, you know, from a conspiracy theorist that kills Bob Yanawire.
[03:49:48.532 --> 03:49:53.875]  He said they've been building, since 1993, Black Hawk helicopters for the year 2017.
[03:49:55.797 --> 03:49:59.423]  26 of them a day, and with the budget of the underground budget.
[03:49:59.423 --> 03:50:06.895]  So I don't know what is going on, but I say just stay cautious and look at the alternative media, because there's a lot of good information.
[03:50:11.346 --> 03:50:17.950]  See, you're going to be taken down, if they can take down InfoWars, they will take you down and nobody will notice.
[03:50:17.950 --> 03:50:22.173]  Because that's, and they're going to have $180 million for starters.
[03:50:22.173 --> 03:50:27.756]  This is, whenever they start a new program, okay, it always starts very, very small.
[03:50:27.756 --> 03:50:28.857]  And then builds on that.
[03:50:28.857 --> 03:50:31.138]  So this is where they're starting.
[03:50:31.138 --> 03:50:37.602]  $180 million with the State Department to come out and cede money to the people who are friendly to the government.
[03:50:37.862 --> 03:50:40.103]  Who will tell the government's side of things.
[03:50:40.103 --> 03:50:43.765]  Who will never question the government's official story.
[03:50:43.765 --> 03:50:48.887]  No matter how absurd, no matter how much of an obvious lie it is, it will never be questioned.
[03:50:48.887 --> 03:50:49.767]  That's what they want.
[03:50:49.767 --> 03:50:51.268]  That's what I grew up with.
[03:50:51.268 --> 03:50:55.309]  I grew up with a situation where there were only three channels in NPR.
[03:50:55.309 --> 03:50:57.250]  We don't want to go back there, folks.
[03:50:57.250 --> 03:50:57.570]  Stay with us.
[03:50:57.570 --> 03:50:59.011]  We'll be right back with more of your phone calls.
[03:50:59.730 --> 03:51:07.813]  What if ExtendoVite really works, but you find that hard to believe, and you spend precious time looking for someone to say, just try it.
[03:51:07.813 --> 03:51:15.677]  I have my health today because of ExtendoVite, and if I did not take a leap of faith and try it, well, I would be on disability today.
[03:51:15.677 --> 03:51:20.479]  Take one bottle of ExtendoVite, as suggested, for 60 days to find out for yourself.
[03:51:20.479 --> 03:51:22.900]  No need to stop any other meds you may be on.
[03:51:22.900 --> 03:51:25.141]  You know by now that they are not working for you.
[03:51:25.481 --> 03:51:32.266]  Before the 60 days are up, I know that you will feel Xtendivite working for you and will want to take another bottle.
[03:51:32.266 --> 03:51:33.407]  Life is too short!

[03:52:59.517 --> 03:53:00.177]  Hello again.
[03:53:00.177 --> 03:53:01.178]  My name is Gary Clark.
[03:53:01.178 --> 03:53:07.883]  I'm the actor who's turning 80 in August who played the part of Steve on the 1960s Western TV series, The Virginian.
[03:53:07.883 --> 03:53:12.747]  Now those of you who've suffered the side effects of prescribed medicines know what I'm talking about.
[03:53:12.747 --> 03:53:19.271]  And those of you who have watched the devastating effects that worrying about you has had on your loved ones.
[03:53:19.271 --> 03:53:22.094]  And what I shared a few months ago is only part of the story.
[03:53:22.094 --> 03:53:26.617]  I neglected to mention how one world whey protein powder has affected my life.
[03:53:26.877 --> 03:53:31.178]  Now, I realize this is not dinner table conversation, but here goes anyway.
[03:53:31.178 --> 03:53:33.959]  One World Way solved my irregularity.
[03:53:33.959 --> 03:53:38.520]  I've been plagued with constipation for years, and I thought it would be that way for the rest of my life.
[03:53:38.520 --> 03:53:42.101]  Three weeks on One World Way set me on a new path.
[03:53:42.101 --> 03:53:45.482]  That was five months ago, and I haven't been irregular since.
[03:53:45.482 --> 03:53:46.882]  Will it work the same way for you?
[03:53:46.882 --> 03:53:47.722]  I don't know.
[03:53:47.722 --> 03:53:48.903]  It worked for me.
[03:53:48.903 --> 03:53:49.223]  Call 888-
[03:53:50.163 --> 03:53:51.684]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:53:51.684 --> 03:53:52.885]  I'm David Knight.
[03:53:52.885 --> 03:53:55.066]  We're going to take your calls in this next segment.
[03:53:55.066 --> 03:54:06.552]  Folks, you have to understand, this is a global war now against free speech.
[03:54:15.717 --> 03:54:21.885]  Many people don't realize that the war on drugs was not something that was created by Richard Nixon in 1971.
[03:54:21.885 --> 03:54:24.168]  It was created by the United Nations in 1961.
[03:54:24.168 --> 03:54:32.899]  It is a worldwide agenda, just like Agenda 21, or the 2030 Agenda for Sustainability, or this new attack on free speech.
[03:54:33.939 --> 03:54:44.022]  Now, the Friday, the last day I was here, Friday, December the 3rd, I talked to Philippe LaRouche, a journalist, 61 years in Europe, with experience, 61 years of experience as a journalist.
[03:54:44.022 --> 03:54:51.304]  And, of course, he's been the head of multiple journalist trade organizations throughout Europe, and he is the sitting president of one of them.
[03:54:51.304 --> 03:54:59.266]  I can't remember the name of it right now, but he was talking about the fact that the European Parliament came out with the same sense that they needed to control
[03:54:59.986 --> 03:55:04.849]  The press from propaganda, and he said, well, what is propaganda?
[03:55:04.849 --> 03:55:07.090]  Who decides what propaganda is?
[03:55:07.090 --> 03:55:09.792]  Oh, the government will decide, of course.
[03:55:09.792 --> 03:55:12.453]  One week later, we had the U.S.
[03:55:12.453 --> 03:55:22.479]  House pass that, and then about 10 days later, we had them insert it into the NDAA Act, $180 million, and that's what we're up against, folks.
[03:55:23.380 --> 03:55:29.986]  $180 million to fight InfoWars, to fight Breitbart, to fight other people who are telling you the truth.
[03:55:29.986 --> 03:55:31.848]  They don't want you to hear the truth.
[03:55:31.848 --> 03:55:43.940]  And so when I look at this Christmas Super Sale special that we've now taken live at InfoWarsLife.com, I think it really ought to be called the 2016 Fight for the Life of Free Speech Sale, because that's what this is, folks.
[03:55:44.420 --> 03:55:48.906]  I mean, we try to offer you the very best prices on the very best products that we can.

[03:55:54.853 --> 03:56:02.863]  How much of this do we have to sell in order to counteract the $180 million of propaganda that's going to be coming out of the government?
[03:56:03.363 --> 03:56:06.687]  Okay, we've got Living Defense, 30% off.

[03:56:22.305 --> 03:56:23.905]  That's the way we fund our operation.
[03:56:23.905 --> 03:56:25.846]  That's the way we maintain our independence.
[03:56:25.846 --> 03:56:35.049]  We don't need 180 million dollars to counter the lies of the State Department as long as we still are on the air.
[03:56:35.049 --> 03:56:38.690]  But we need your help to fund this operation to get this microphone out there.
[03:56:38.690 --> 03:56:46.873]  So go to InfoWarsLive, take a look at the 2016 Christmas Super Sale because it really is a sale for your right to know.
[03:56:47.453 --> 03:56:48.734]  You're right to know the truth.
[03:56:48.734 --> 03:56:51.416]  You're right to question authority.
[03:56:51.416 --> 03:56:57.701]  Authority that is going to now be propagandizing you actively and overtly, not just covertly.
[03:56:57.701 --> 03:56:59.402]  Let's quickly go to our other callers here.
[03:56:59.402 --> 03:57:00.283]  Taylor in Texas.
[03:57:00.283 --> 03:57:00.863]  Go ahead, Taylor.
[03:57:00.863 --> 03:57:03.405]  Oh, hey, David.
[03:57:03.405 --> 03:57:04.206]  How are you doing?
[03:57:04.206 --> 03:57:05.487]  Doing good.
[03:57:05.487 --> 03:57:06.107]  Very little time.
[03:57:06.107 --> 03:57:06.508]  Go quickly.
[03:57:07.731 --> 03:57:19.976]  Okay, so I'm a software engineer, and you guys were talking about the election earlier, and I asked for a paper ballot in Texas, and they denied me that option.
[03:57:19.976 --> 03:57:28.340]  And I know how easy it is to hack into a computer system, and I'm just a regular Joe Schmoe, and so if I can do that,
[03:57:28.941 --> 03:57:36.956]  I imagine what government officials and other people with higher background could possibly do to influence the election.
[03:57:36.956 --> 03:57:39.420]  Yeah, people like Homeland Security could do that, couldn't they?
[03:57:40.803 --> 03:57:42.964]  Somebody tried to do that in Georgia and elsewhere.
[03:57:42.964 --> 03:57:48.526]  Yeah, it's absolutely insane that we would do things to make our election vulnerable to fraud.
[03:57:48.526 --> 03:57:53.847]  And you and I both know, because of our technical background, that it is very easy to do that.
[03:57:53.847 --> 03:57:57.608]  Anybody that's on the internet knows how easy it is to have your computer hacked.
[03:57:57.608 --> 03:58:08.432]  If you want to look at the self-driving cars with all the electronic stuff in it, every year at the Black Hat Conference they show you how they can take over a car and drive it into the ditch, or they can slam on the brakes, or they can slam on the accelerator.
[03:58:08.892 --> 03:58:15.354]  We need to understand the vulnerabilities that they're deliberately building into our infrastructure and into our elections.
[03:58:15.354 --> 03:58:20.135]  That's where the real concern needs to be and I'm afraid Jill Stein has shut down a lot of that, given it a bad name.
[03:58:20.135 --> 03:58:24.956]  We need to come back and we need to make our elections more honest and not less dishonest.
[03:58:24.956 --> 03:58:26.096]  That's it for today's show.
[03:58:26.096 --> 03:58:29.037]  Join us tonight for the Infowars Nightly News at 7 central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:29.037 --> 03:58:29.337]  Eastern.
[03:58:29.337 --> 03:58:29.877]  I'm David Knight.
