[00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:03.372]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:00:03.372 --> 00:00:07.482]  It's Friday, the 15th of April, 2016.
[00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:09.948]  We've got a very important transmission lined up.
[00:00:09.948 --> 00:00:11.912]  But first, a key report from John Boehn.
[00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:28.101]  The panicked elite are buying up underground bunkers and or fleeing to parts unknown as all indications point towards a collapse that will, in the words of economist Peter Schiff, be the earthquake that follows the 2008 tremor.
[00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:42.312]  The Chicago Tribune reported that about 3,000 individuals with net assets of $1 million or more left Chicago in the last year alone due to the exploding climate of unrest growing in the union stockyards.
[00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:45.295]  So, if somebody wants to build a coal-fired plant, they can.
[00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:50.659]  It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted.
[00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:13.117]  Before Obama ever came around, coal was doing good.
[00:01:13.117 --> 00:01:14.878]  Obama killed it.
[00:01:14.878 --> 00:01:18.619]  We have citizens digging through the trash just to eat.
[00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.800]  I wish they'd just step off the face of the earth.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.241]  It wouldn't hurt my feelings none.
[00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:31.604]  What's actually hurt coal is not any EPA rules as much as it is really cheap natural gas that has come from fracking.
[00:01:31.604 --> 00:01:36.566]  They're fracking with such corrupt practices across the United States that
[00:01:37.577 --> 00:01:44.397]  The well water is catching on fire.
[00:01:44.397 --> 00:01:44.597]  Whoa!
[00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:50.520]  Soros signals Argentina's shale is biggest place to be.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:01.824]  Soros doubled its stake in state-owned oil company in Argentina, while for the last seven years, spending tens of millions of dollars to lobby to shut down shale production in the U.S.
[00:02:01.824 --> 00:02:03.925]  by wildcat small companies.
[00:02:03.925 --> 00:02:08.427]  And I'm not saying shale fracking is good overall.
[00:02:08.427 --> 00:02:14.709]  I'm not saying there aren't problems, but most of it's financed by Soros and Saudi Arabia, who don't want us to have our own oil.
[00:02:15.987 --> 00:02:22.093]  So a coal plant in Mexico that's totally dirty is okay, but a coal plant in Texas that's clean is not okay.
[00:02:22.093 --> 00:02:30.702]  And most of these crackers and oil sands people can't break even unless oil is over $80 or at least over $55.
[00:02:30.702 --> 00:02:34.106]  I think it's $10 to $20 in the next several years.
[00:02:34.566 --> 00:02:43.532]  So this is their, what they're doing is they're pumping their existing wells to the max to create cash flow because their wells are not, it's not expensive to pump.
[00:02:43.532 --> 00:02:46.194]  It's expensive to find the darn things and drill.
[00:02:46.194 --> 00:02:53.999]  And they were only able to do that with the cheapest junk bonds in history because of quantitative easing and artificial stimulus and by oil price.
[00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:55.880]  So that's the next thing to hit the United States.
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:10.234]  The Wall Street Journal reports that the largest coal company in the United States has filed for bankruptcy, an event that will result in energy costs that will sharply rise on the American middle class like they have on the common people of Germany.
[00:03:10.234 --> 00:03:17.681]  Germany's energy policies have gradually doubled the average industrial cost per kilowatt hour as clean and renewable energy
[00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:19.623]  Can't carry the load.
[00:03:19.623 --> 00:03:20.564]  Literally.
[00:03:20.564 --> 00:03:26.772]  Last week, Obama began pushing for housing lenders to offer home loans to people with bad credit.
[00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:31.617]  What better way to push the economy over the edge than to repeat the same 2008 nightmare?
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.282]  We're using data on housing and neighborhood conditions to help cities identify the areas that need the most help.
[00:03:40.282 --> 00:03:47.624]  By 2014, investors had already begun to notice another government-fed subprime housing bubble on the horizon.
[00:03:47.624 --> 00:04:00.688]  Investors Business Daily wrote in January of 2014, what stoked housing inflation was federal housing policies designed to boost home ownership among low-income and minority borrowers.
[00:04:00.928 --> 00:04:08.212]  Between 2011 and the third quarter of 2013, housing prices rose nearly 6%.
[00:04:08.212 --> 00:04:10.393]  Triple the increase in rental costs.
[00:04:10.393 --> 00:04:15.115]  Both this bubble and the last one were caused by the government's housing policies.
[00:04:15.115 --> 00:04:23.820]  Low down payments, a mere 5% at Fannie and Freddie and just 3.5% at the FHA are fueling the bubble.
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.342]  But new qualified mortgage rules don't require a minimum down payment for borrowers in 2014.
[00:04:30.563 --> 00:04:35.528]  The country has been misled about financial reform.
[00:04:35.528 --> 00:04:40.994]  Infowars has called for Obama's impeachment on numerous occasions, to no avail.
[00:04:40.994 --> 00:04:48.022]  His supposed lame-duck presidency, heading into the end of his term, has been tremendously underestimated.
[00:04:48.442 --> 00:04:58.492]  Americans are nothing less than under a full New World Order attack, aided and abetted by the Executive Branch of the United States of America.
[00:04:58.492 --> 00:05:00.274]  John Bound for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:00.274 --> 00:05:07.501]  A seismologist warns that catastrophic mega-earthquakes are on their way after five major earthquakes took place in the last 48 hours.
[00:05:08.502 --> 00:05:19.996]  Seismologist Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado has made headlines all over the world by warning that current conditions might trigger at least four earthquakes greater than 8.0 in magnitude.
[00:05:19.996 --> 00:05:26.845]  If his projections are accurate, our planet could be on the precipice of a wave of natural disasters unlike anything that any of us have witnessed before.
[00:05:27.045 --> 00:05:32.951]  A single magnitude 8.0 earthquake in a populated area would be a disaster of historic proportions.
[00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:33.973]  But four of them?
[00:05:33.973 --> 00:05:36.115]  That would be a complete and utter nightmare.
[00:05:36.115 --> 00:05:41.541]  And according to Volcano Discovery, 38 volcanoes around the globe are erupting right now.
[00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:42.522]  Michael Snyder asks,
[00:05:42.722 --> 00:05:43.883]  Why is this happening?
[00:05:43.883 --> 00:05:47.788]  Why is the crust of the earth shaking so violently all of a sudden?
[00:05:47.788 --> 00:05:53.395]  In Matthew 24, Jesus warned us that there would be earthquakes in diverse places just prior to his return.
[00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:57.240]  Are we truly in the times the Bible refers to as the last days?

[00:06:00.023 --> 00:06:03.524]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.491]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:09.093]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:07:09.093 --> 00:07:16.996]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:07:17.456 --> 00:07:23.599]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:28.642]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[00:07:28.642 --> 00:07:32.664]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:07:32.664 --> 00:07:35.065]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire.
[00:07:35.325 --> 00:07:35.846]  We're good.
[00:08:00.592 --> 00:08:01.212]  We've got it.
[00:08:01.212 --> 00:08:07.736]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:08:07.736 --> 00:08:12.118]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:12.118 --> 00:08:19.761]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:19.761 --> 00:08:24.524]  I woke up this morning at about 6.30 a.m.
[00:08:24.524 --> 00:08:25.124]  and it hit me.
[00:08:30.163 --> 00:08:36.149]  One of the biggest problems we face is that we're losing boundaries.
[00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:37.711]  We're losing impulse control.
[00:08:37.711 --> 00:08:43.457]  And when I talk about impulse control, I mean within the governing and elite class.
[00:08:45.976 --> 00:08:53.899]  I was just thinking about how they have this race going, in their own words, to merge with machines and become gods.
[00:08:53.899 --> 00:09:05.243]  And they've already decided in all the dominant literature that humans are obsolete and an ugly bad thing and that we're going to phase out the human race as it's known.
[00:09:05.243 --> 00:09:14.166]  That is the collective cosmology or belief system of the ruling establishment.
[00:09:16.493 --> 00:09:33.497]  They've taken over the world, mainly through crony capitalism and combines, and now they're looking at everyone else eating up their resources that they believe belong to them, and they're shutting up a system to phase out humanity as we know it.
[00:09:33.497 --> 00:09:38.739]  Now obviously I have stacks of news here to cover today, but why do I so often open with that general theme?
[00:09:38.739 --> 00:09:39.919]  Because that is what's happening.
[00:09:39.919 --> 00:09:43.280]  We're on a space rock.
[00:09:44.545 --> 00:09:45.865]  It's not that big.
[00:09:45.865 --> 00:09:57.208]  Seven and a half billion of us, hurtling around the sun at 30-something thousand miles an hour.
[00:09:57.208 --> 00:10:07.151]  And we look at these elites and these leaders, who are just like leaders of old, they just have more high-tech weapons and more propaganda.
[00:10:07.151 --> 00:10:10.692]  They have the same hubris, the same megalomania, the same mental illness.
[00:10:12.315 --> 00:10:20.665]  And I see the amount of delusion and mental illness increasing in the general public.
[00:10:20.665 --> 00:10:28.835]  And it's admitted that mental illness is skyrocketing and delusional behavior, but I see it all around me.
[00:10:28.835 --> 00:10:30.678]  I've probably known personally
[00:10:33.086 --> 00:10:46.575]  Twelve or thirteen people, I was thinking about it this morning, in just the last six years that were normal and behaving normally, who went completely insane.
[00:10:46.575 --> 00:10:48.977]  Is it the water?
[00:10:48.977 --> 00:10:49.758]  Is it the air?
[00:10:49.758 --> 00:10:51.399]  Is it the unnatural culture?
[00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:58.504]  You know, we've heard about cabin fever in the cold winter when you're locked up, you know, at the North Pole for a month and most people start going crazy.
[00:10:59.585 --> 00:11:07.567]  Heard about cabin fever on ships, heard about space fever when people are out in space for a month or so, they start going nuts, even the strongest people.
[00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:10.108]  We're living in such an unnatural world.
[00:11:10.108 --> 00:11:14.310]  And I'm not bashing technology, I'm bashing some of the bad side effects of it.
[00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.870]  And I've used this analogy many times.
[00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:28.074]  It's like if you're on a Mars mission, a year and a half to get to Mars with the current technology, if they try to go to Mars at the right time in a cycle when the
[00:11:29.332 --> 00:11:52.348]  Planet is closer to us, the fourth rock, that even the most healthy astronaut who could run, you know, two marathons back to back on Earth, when they get to Mars, will have to spend a few months basically being able to work out on the surface, slowly be able to jog or lift up a 20-pound box.
[00:11:52.348 --> 00:11:58.633]  Russian cosmonauts that have been in space for a year, you know, have trouble even getting up out of their seats.
[00:12:00.253 --> 00:12:03.156]  Russia, last time I checked, has the longest time spent in space.
[00:12:03.156 --> 00:12:09.662]  I think one time somebody spent almost two years up there, and it showed when the capsule came down, they couldn't even get up.
[00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:12.485]  They had trouble breathing, had to give them oxygen.
[00:12:12.485 --> 00:12:17.269]  Their lungs couldn't even operate.
[00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:24.296]  And that's what it is with screen time and calculators and all these machines and buzzing this and buzzing that and smartphones.
[00:12:25.967 --> 00:12:36.291]  We're being encased in a control grid that dumbs us down, makes us unhealthy, makes us unhappy.
[00:12:36.291 --> 00:12:45.234]  People say, hey hypocrite, you're sitting at the center of a high-tech news studio wired in like maybe only one-tenth of one percent of people are.
[00:12:45.234 --> 00:12:51.356]  I mean, this is like per square foot, got more computers and wires and antennas than the Pentagon.
[00:12:51.356 --> 00:12:52.157]  I get it.
[00:12:52.157 --> 00:12:52.597]  I know.
[00:12:54.312 --> 00:12:55.673]  That's my point.
[00:12:55.673 --> 00:13:02.677]  How do you live in this and contain your humanity and keep it?
[00:13:02.677 --> 00:13:07.880]  And I've got a stack of news along that line today that we're going to be getting to, the way they're selling it.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:12.163]  DNA analysis could help improve your workout study finds.
[00:13:12.163 --> 00:13:17.426]  Reuters.
[00:13:17.426 --> 00:13:20.988]  My dad wanted me to talk about this like a month ago and I never did.
[00:13:23.476 --> 00:13:25.957]  But I had him run back to my office and get it.
[00:13:25.957 --> 00:13:28.177]  Thank you, Nico.
[00:13:28.177 --> 00:13:31.018]  He went because he decided to go ahead and keep his dental license.
[00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:36.239]  And boy, that came in handy when my son, my dad's an endodontist and oral surgeon, a lot of other stuff.
[00:13:36.239 --> 00:13:41.900]  My son jumped on the trampoline, went to a friend's house, knocked his two front teeth out.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:50.001]  And of course, if he had gone to the emergency room, they would have just taken him, you know, they were like back at a 45 degree angle, basically out hanging by a meat.
[00:13:50.001 --> 00:13:52.762]  But my dad got him back in and looks like he'll be able to keep them, thank God.
[00:13:53.871 --> 00:14:12.056]  But long story short, he was going back to get his continuing education just to keep his license, just so he can work on the family a few months ago, because his license was coming up.
[00:14:12.056 --> 00:14:14.557]  He retired via Obamacare.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.482]  This is so immoral, he refuses to be part of it.
[00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:20.165]  He was also managing several hundred medical clinics.
[00:14:20.165 --> 00:14:22.607]  And he got out of it, even though he was very successful.
[00:14:22.607 --> 00:14:26.271]  Because again, it's just, it's so evil.
[00:14:26.271 --> 00:14:29.194]  And that was the plan.
[00:14:29.194 --> 00:14:30.615]  You know, get all the good medical people out.
[00:14:30.615 --> 00:14:32.777]  It's working well.
[00:14:32.777 --> 00:14:35.160]  Now he's bringing the foreign doctors and the rest of it and lower the standards.
[00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.852]  Not that foreign doctors are bad either, it's just that they come from India or Eastern Europe.
[00:14:40.852 --> 00:14:49.036]  They're used to ration care, they're used to following orders, they're used to not having a Hippocratic oath, but I digress.
[00:14:49.036 --> 00:14:49.917]  They're used to socialism.
[00:14:52.099 --> 00:15:03.065]  And he was in several days of a continuing education and most of it is about the DEA and prescriptions and this rule and that rule and how to fill this chart out and all that garbage.
[00:15:03.065 --> 00:15:10.529]  And he said like half a day was on how everyone's going to have DNA chips starting in the next year or two.
[00:15:10.529 --> 00:15:14.291]  And how you won't give anyone a prescription unless they have a DNA chip.
[00:15:16.414 --> 00:15:34.957]  And then how in the next rollout, the DNA chip will communicate with chips in all of the pills and that they're going to then basically have smart meters all over the place that are reading your bodies as you just walk down the street to see what you're on and then call the police on you.
[00:15:34.957 --> 00:15:39.618]  And by the way, I mean, I told people about license plate reading cameras 20 years ago and they didn't believe it.
[00:15:39.618 --> 00:15:40.758]  Now you know they're everywhere.
[00:15:40.758 --> 00:15:42.739]  It's the same thing.
[00:15:42.739 --> 00:15:43.619]  Here it is in business.
[00:15:46.678 --> 00:15:47.218]  Insider.
[00:15:47.218 --> 00:15:50.959]  I have another one on the London Telegraph.
[00:15:50.959 --> 00:15:54.260]  Smart mattress lets you know if your partner is cheating.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:16:04.482]  See, chips are so cheap now that you pay $5 extra, $10 extra, and the smart mattress tells you everything you're on, what you've been doing, and if you've had sex with somebody else.
[00:16:04.482 --> 00:16:07.782]  See, they're enticing us into the spy grid.
[00:16:07.782 --> 00:16:08.863]  Just like I read 15, 16 years ago in AP.
[00:16:11.932 --> 00:16:17.675]  How they were coming out with the new light bulbs under mandate and thank goodness they just so happened to work.
[00:16:17.675 --> 00:16:18.836]  No, they were designed that way.
[00:16:18.836 --> 00:16:22.618]  This is unity of agenda.
[00:16:22.618 --> 00:16:26.000]  This is standardized global rollout.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:40.328]  That data over power lines would then send data through your power lines into your house and then into smart meters and smart interfaces and smart bulbs and the bulbs would then communicate with different things in your house
[00:16:40.928 --> 00:16:48.370]  And it also had a fringe benefit, just accidentally, just like it accidentally, you know, just hooks into the grid and data.
[00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:52.752]  It accidentally can calm you during crises.
[00:16:52.752 --> 00:17:01.314]  And it will know when, just like the smart meters we told you 16, 17 years ago would tax you during key times and would control your thermostat.
[00:17:01.314 --> 00:17:05.816]  It's now being done in four states.
[00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:06.876]  Li-Fi, all of it.
[00:17:06.876 --> 00:17:08.796]  And this is what's so frustrating.
[00:17:08.796 --> 00:17:10.297]  I'm only scratching the surface.
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:17.743]  And this is all being rolled out like the elite are an alien force or something.
[00:17:17.743 --> 00:17:38.072]  Imagine a science fiction movie where they look like humans but they have all this high tech and they're making it where everything from the TVs to the toasters to your mattress to your car is remote controlled by them, tracks you and taxes you to siphon off all your funds to their corporate reservations where they're actually building a breakaway civilization.
[00:17:38.072 --> 00:17:39.593]  That'd be a neat science fiction movie, wouldn't it?
[00:17:42.537 --> 00:17:47.719]  That's what they're doing, and they're not aliens, they're crazy people.
[00:17:47.719 --> 00:17:55.002]  Who are inspired, if you go to Bohemian Grove, skull and bones in places, by Lucifer.
[00:17:55.002 --> 00:17:57.003]  Now, who's Lucifer?
[00:17:57.003 --> 00:18:03.025]  He's fallen to Earth, he doesn't like us, he wants to override creation and set himself up as God.
[00:18:03.025 --> 00:18:04.266]  That's what the Bible says.
[00:18:04.266 --> 00:18:09.548]  It's happening.
[00:18:09.548 --> 00:18:12.129]  A fallen entity, who fell to this planet,
[00:18:14.639 --> 00:18:18.341]  And is doing this to us.
[00:18:18.341 --> 00:18:19.442]  I mean, there's the answer.
[00:18:19.442 --> 00:18:20.103]  It's all real.
[00:18:20.103 --> 00:18:22.804]  It's really happening.
[00:18:22.804 --> 00:18:27.988]  And whether that Lucifer is real or not, the elite are doing it.
[00:18:27.988 --> 00:18:29.729]  They're building it.
[00:18:29.729 --> 00:18:31.710]  So I'm going to talk about this later in the broadcast.
[00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.671]  We've got a bunch of guests coming up as well.
[00:18:33.671 --> 00:18:37.214]  But I want to do a whole report, too, on DNA chips.
[00:18:37.214 --> 00:18:38.795]  And again, the chip isn't in you.
[00:18:38.795 --> 00:18:40.736]  They take your blood once.
[00:18:40.736 --> 00:18:42.257]  It's then in a chip database.
[00:18:44.266 --> 00:18:46.749]  And then they can take your blood and prick you again whenever they want.
[00:18:46.749 --> 00:18:48.070]  It's just quick and easy and no big deal.
[00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:52.875]  And they got a bunch of different ones coming out, but... MIT News.
[00:18:52.875 --> 00:18:56.739]  Major step in implantable drug delivery device.
[00:18:56.739 --> 00:19:01.224]  Why pharma wants to put sensors in the blockbuster drug.
[00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:05.468]  Microchip implants medication on command.
[00:19:05.468 --> 00:19:06.509]  Scientific.
[00:19:06.509 --> 00:19:06.689]  And then...
[00:19:07.489 --> 00:19:08.389]  This isn't the full one.
[00:19:08.389 --> 00:19:09.169]  Here it is.
[00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:13.951]  Lab-on-a-chip technology for near-patient diagnosis.
[00:19:13.951 --> 00:19:15.611]  This is Austin Publishing.
[00:19:15.611 --> 00:19:17.572]  This is what they were teaching him.
[00:19:17.572 --> 00:19:21.572]  Bio-electronic DNA chips for the clinical laboratory.
[00:19:21.572 --> 00:19:27.274]  And they're telling him, when he went for his continuing education, as an endodontist, as an oral surgeon,
[00:19:28.732 --> 00:19:31.553]  They told them, oh yeah, this is what everybody's going to have.
[00:19:31.553 --> 00:19:39.397]  Just like they told my cousin, who's just got out of the army at 35 years, 10 years ago, that troops were going to start getting chips, and they did start getting them.
[00:19:39.397 --> 00:19:41.078]  Special forces and people.
[00:19:41.078 --> 00:19:42.999]  And then it's classified, so they can't tell you.
[00:19:42.999 --> 00:19:49.382]  I mean, the chipping's already going on, and then it was in MIT Magazine a few months ago that troops are getting rain chips.
[00:19:49.382 --> 00:19:52.844]  And it shows them putting rain chips in them.
[00:19:52.844 --> 00:19:54.785]  Of course, they're opting into the programs now.
[00:19:54.785 --> 00:19:56.366]  Soon it'll be mandatory.
[00:19:56.366 --> 00:19:58.147]  We got the big Trump news, straight ahead, stay with us.
[00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.131]  Hello, I'm Michael Reagan.
[00:20:02.131 --> 00:20:09.496]  My father, President Ronald Reagan, believes so strongly in gold that in 1985, he changed gold ownership forever.
[00:20:09.496 --> 00:20:15.260]  Today, our national debt is spiraling out of control, but gold coins could be the answer.
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:24.626]  Call 1-866-525-GOLD or go online to usmoneyreserve.com to get new, never-before-released information about gold.
[00:20:24.626 --> 00:20:25.227]  From the U.S.
[00:20:25.227 --> 00:20:26.507]  Money Reserve, call 1-866-525-GOLD.
[00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:31.450]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.251]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:20:33.251 --> 00:20:34.891]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:37.712]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:20:37.712 --> 00:20:40.013]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:20:40.013 --> 00:20:44.514]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[00:20:44.514 --> 00:20:48.456]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:52.237]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[00:20:52.237 --> 00:20:52.557]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[00:20:52.557 --> 00:20:53.977]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[00:21:00.057 --> 00:21:04.421]  Biochemistry determines your mood, memory, energy, and endurance.
[00:21:04.421 --> 00:21:07.424]  Your body's primary metabolic function is to make protein.
[00:21:07.424 --> 00:21:10.366]  One World Whey is a unique, non-denatured protein.
[00:21:10.366 --> 00:21:15.611]  This enables your body to have virtually 100% utilization, whereas typical whey protein powders offer
[00:21:15.851 --> 00:21:18.752]  No more than 18% utilization of protein.
[00:21:18.752 --> 00:21:21.873]  One World Way also delivers life-giving frequencies to your cells.
[00:21:21.873 --> 00:21:27.415]  The net result for so many people is improved energy, mood, and elimination of pain from inflammation.
[00:21:27.415 --> 00:21:31.296]  This technologically enhanced One World Way has been really amazing.
[00:21:31.876 --> 00:21:38.477]  I'm 36 years old, and for the past several years, I've been struggling with lack of energy, drive, and stamina.
[00:21:38.477 --> 00:21:42.298]  And after just two weeks on this product, I'm feeling so much more energy.
[00:21:42.298 --> 00:21:48.580]  My yoga practice has deepened, and as a massage therapist, I'm able to see more clients than I've been able to in years.
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.720]  I've never felt results that quick with anything I've ever taken.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.301]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[00:21:54.301 --> 00:21:56.301]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[00:21:59.722 --> 00:22:04.063]  Serious investors and traders want to make 81% return in 60 seconds?

[00:22:29.588 --> 00:22:39.015]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day, but growing scientific evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.
[00:22:39.015 --> 00:22:43.438]  The solution is DefenderShield, the most effective mobile radiation shielding ever developed.
[00:22:43.438 --> 00:22:49.422]  DefenderShield blocks virtually 100% of EMF radiation from cell phones, tablets, and laptops, and starts at just $64.99.

[00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:03.392]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:23:03.392 --> 00:23:04.012]  It's true.
[00:23:04.012 --> 00:23:08.153]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:23:08.153 --> 00:23:10.554]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:23:10.554 --> 00:23:15.016]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[00:23:15.336 --> 00:23:28.215]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[00:23:28.215 --> 00:23:31.720]  Big Berkey Water Filters are the original and most trusted on the market.

[00:23:38.965 --> 00:23:39.786]  Big Berkey.

[00:23:49.693 --> 00:23:50.754]  For the love of clean water.
[00:24:02.529 --> 00:24:06.210]  I think I'm gonna make a liner that intros this.
[00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:10.491]  Cause you can't starve us out, you can't make us run.
[00:24:31.167 --> 00:24:38.090]  The establishment wants domesticated populations, and that's what they're doing with this high-tech overwrite.
[00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:45.212]  Technology is not being brought in to empower us, but to hamstring us.
[00:24:45.212 --> 00:24:46.973]  To enslave us.
[00:24:46.973 --> 00:24:51.475]  We've got a lot of big guests coming up today.
[00:25:04.589 --> 00:25:07.613]  Larry Nichols is popping in with big news.
[00:25:07.613 --> 00:25:10.376]  Colonel Rob Maness, who is running for the U.S.
[00:25:10.376 --> 00:25:12.479]  Senate, really interesting fellow, is going to pop in.
[00:25:12.479 --> 00:25:14.521]  He had a shift.
[00:25:14.521 --> 00:25:18.867]  Rob Dew and the crew from Denver.
[00:25:18.867 --> 00:25:20.068]  They were in New York yesterday.
[00:25:21.206 --> 00:25:21.947]  Here's the best part.
[00:25:21.947 --> 00:25:22.387]  Crank it up.
[00:25:22.387 --> 00:25:23.729]  What we're waiting for.
[00:25:23.729 --> 00:25:26.332]  Because you can't starve us out!
[00:25:26.332 --> 00:25:27.753]  Oh, they've got shotguns?
[00:25:27.753 --> 00:25:28.775]  They say grace.
[00:25:28.775 --> 00:25:30.016]  They say amen.
[00:25:30.016 --> 00:25:32.539]  And if you're not into that, well you know what?
[00:25:42.904 --> 00:25:46.207]  That's what it comes down to, those bitter clingers.
[00:25:46.207 --> 00:25:59.939]  We're going to have the crew on pre-demonstration there in Denver against the theft of the election by the Republican and Democratic establishment.
[00:25:59.939 --> 00:26:01.220]  It's at the RNC.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.022]  I talked to Roger Stone yesterday.
[00:26:03.022 --> 00:26:03.942]  He begged the listeners.
[00:26:03.942 --> 00:26:07.565]  He said, please tell your listeners, get involved, take action.
[00:26:08.854 --> 00:26:10.615]  Get in there, be part of this.
[00:26:10.615 --> 00:26:23.799]  And the good news is, the media engaged in a giant, sickening psyop, but they gauged the public, and now it all collapsed starting yesterday.
[00:26:23.799 --> 00:26:34.063]  I monitor the news, obviously, as my crew does, and many of you do, and I see in the controlled media their attempts
[00:26:36.587 --> 00:26:42.991]  In everything from the Washington Post, to USA Today, to MSNBC, to CNN, and Fox.
[00:26:42.991 --> 00:26:49.214]  To normalize, of course no one ever votes in primaries and the party appoints the nominee.
[00:26:49.214 --> 00:26:50.295]  That's never happened before.
[00:26:50.295 --> 00:26:54.077]  If that starts happening, then it's a dictatorship of an oligarchy.
[00:26:54.077 --> 00:27:00.160]  It's like the Chinese system, the Central Committee, and then the Politburo.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.823]  Yes, you have people who represent the voters from the precinct who are pledged, and if it's neck and neck,
[00:27:07.429 --> 00:27:10.611]  Then, historically, there can be some jockeying.
[00:27:10.611 --> 00:27:14.774]  I mean, Reagan won by a handy amount in the delegates, but they still try to take it from him.
[00:27:14.774 --> 00:27:18.077]  So that was the first time this got floated around.
[00:27:18.077 --> 00:27:32.427]  They put it on the books four years before, in 76, but they tried it in 1980, and the threat was enough to get Reagan to put George Herbert Walker Bush in the VP slot, and then Reagan got shot, and the rest is history.
[00:27:32.427 --> 00:27:36.130]  We've had three rounds of Bushes, and now they want a fourth one with Ted Cruz.
[00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:39.891]  And it's with heavy heart I have to come out against Ted Cruz.
[00:27:39.891 --> 00:27:44.252]  I ignore all the Goldman Sachs stuff and the Bush connections, hoping that that's just how he came up and he was for real.
[00:27:44.252 --> 00:27:44.632]  No.
[00:27:44.632 --> 00:27:45.792]  He's a total operative.
[00:27:45.792 --> 00:27:48.933]  He's uncloaked in his arrogance.
[00:27:48.933 --> 00:27:51.094]  And I'm physically sick over it.
[00:27:51.094 --> 00:27:53.894]  I physically am sick of betrayal.
[00:27:53.894 --> 00:27:55.335]  I want to believe in this country.
[00:27:55.335 --> 00:27:57.115]  I want things to get better.
[00:27:57.115 --> 00:27:58.616]  I want to believe in the government.
[00:27:58.616 --> 00:27:59.756]  I want to believe in the people.
[00:27:59.756 --> 00:28:02.217]  I'm tired of it!
[00:28:02.217 --> 00:28:03.477]  Where are the honorable people?
[00:28:07.148 --> 00:28:12.698]  And the good news is, starting about yesterday, I saw it shift and even mainstream media went.
[00:28:13.632 --> 00:28:19.236]  And even Fox and CNN and others were like, as I monitor it, were like, yeah, I mean, people do want the popular vote to be counted.
[00:28:19.236 --> 00:28:20.277]  We better do it.
[00:28:20.277 --> 00:28:27.642]  You better not try that because they realized no one was buying their PSYOP that everyone wants open, you know, borders.
[00:28:27.642 --> 00:28:29.724]  Everybody wants forced vaccines.
[00:28:29.724 --> 00:28:31.545]  Everybody wants to be spied on.
[00:28:31.545 --> 00:28:33.527]  Everybody wants to not have a vote.
[00:28:33.527 --> 00:28:35.188]  Of course you never vote.
[00:28:35.188 --> 00:28:37.029]  Like, well, why don't we have primaries?
[00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:38.170]  Why don't we vote before?
[00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:40.331]  Why'd you say we get the government we vote for?
[00:28:41.152 --> 00:28:44.894]  If I don't get to vote, then I don't get to pay taxes or follow your laws.
[00:28:44.894 --> 00:28:48.475]  You don't just sit up there over me.
[00:28:48.475 --> 00:28:52.196]  And so, a stack of articles today in my stack.
[00:28:52.196 --> 00:28:55.378]  I mean, there's like 15 articles I came across without even looking.
[00:28:55.378 --> 00:28:55.698]  U.S.
[00:28:55.698 --> 00:28:56.678]  News & World Report.
[00:28:56.678 --> 00:28:59.960]  Sarah Palin says voters should decide GOP nomination.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.601]  Wow, that's... Man, what a weirdo.
[00:29:02.601 --> 00:29:03.301]  Voters?
[00:29:03.301 --> 00:29:06.502]  What are those?
[00:29:06.502 --> 00:29:07.863]  CBS News.
[00:29:07.863 --> 00:29:10.704]  Why the GOP can't take the nomination from Donald Trump?
[00:29:13.206 --> 00:29:14.107]  And it goes on and on.
[00:29:14.107 --> 00:29:17.330]  Cold greeting for Cruz at GOP Gala.
[00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:18.631]  He's going down to the polls.
[00:29:18.631 --> 00:29:23.676]  New Yorkers, ignore Ted Cruz at GOP Gala.
[00:29:23.676 --> 00:29:27.320]  They've dropped the charges against Trump's former campaign head.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.482]  Still former, but in transition.
[00:29:29.482 --> 00:29:32.365]  And now the witnesses are coming out that she was falling down drunk, stumbling around.
[00:29:32.365 --> 00:29:33.686]  It's just all made up.
[00:29:33.686 --> 00:29:34.407]  It's what these people do.
[00:29:35.959 --> 00:29:39.942]  So that's all coming up, and we're going to get into a bunch of clips, the latest on the election.
[00:29:39.942 --> 00:29:42.625]  And our crew was in New York yesterday, now they're in Denver.
[00:29:42.625 --> 00:29:45.227]  We have a lot of footage, we can't play it here because of all the cussing.
[00:29:45.227 --> 00:29:47.789]  Because the anti-Trump people do not talk.
[00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:50.731]  All they do is cuss and spit and run around in circles.
[00:29:50.731 --> 00:29:52.653]  They attack people.
[00:29:52.653 --> 00:29:53.474]  It was amazing.
[00:29:53.474 --> 00:29:55.055]  It's all coming up.
[00:30:00.302 --> 00:30:06.184]  A Connecticut judge has placed herself above the Constitution and above an explicit congressional law.
[00:30:06.184 --> 00:30:14.106]  Judge Barbara Bellis has ruled that Sandy Hook families can sue gun manufacturers Remington, Bushmaster, and others.
[00:30:14.106 --> 00:30:18.927]  But Congress has already explicitly protected firearm manufacturers from liability.
[00:30:19.187 --> 00:30:34.678]  In the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which says they will not be held liable for, quote, the harm caused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse firearm products or ammunition products that function as designed and intended.
[00:30:34.678 --> 00:30:48.808]  The act goes on to explain to people with an anti-gun agenda like Judge Bellis that, quote, the possibility of imposing liability on an entire industry for harm that is solely caused by others is an abuse of the legal system, unquote.
[00:30:48.988 --> 00:30:49.728]  What's next?
[00:30:49.728 --> 00:30:53.710]  Holding Ford liable for a drunk driver killing someone with the car that they made?
[00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:57.572]  If Hillary Clinton has her way, that's what they will do to gun manufacturers.
[00:30:57.572 --> 00:30:59.432]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.

[00:32:00.174 --> 00:32:00.834]  Uh, yeah.
[00:32:00.834 --> 00:32:06.655]  First of all, I want to say, take the 12, that's two, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[00:32:06.655 --> 00:32:07.615]  I use them all.
[00:32:07.615 --> 00:32:08.596]  They're phenomenal.
[00:32:08.596 --> 00:32:09.336]  They work.
[00:32:09.336 --> 00:32:10.176]  Buy them, folks.
[00:32:10.176 --> 00:32:10.736]  Thank you, brother.
[00:32:10.736 --> 00:32:12.576]  I want to thank you guys for putting those out there.
[00:32:12.576 --> 00:32:18.798]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[00:32:18.798 --> 00:32:20.798]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[00:32:20.798 --> 00:32:26.199]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[00:32:26.639 --> 00:32:27.360]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.044]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, AcuFX, Nascent... Let me ask you a question.
[00:32:32.044 --> 00:32:33.085]  Have they worked for you?
[00:32:33.085 --> 00:32:35.947]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[00:32:35.947 --> 00:32:37.309]  What products are you taking?
[00:32:37.309 --> 00:32:45.316]  Everything from Super Male to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA Force.
[00:32:45.316 --> 00:32:48.779]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[00:32:48.939 --> 00:32:53.991]  Visit Infowarslives.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[00:32:53.991 --> 00:32:56.015]  That's Infowarslives.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:33:15.749 --> 00:33:20.741]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:20.741 --> 00:33:25.452]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:49.654 --> 00:33:52.036]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:52.036 --> 00:33:52.757]  to 3 p.m.
[00:33:52.757 --> 00:33:55.479]  Central, we are here broadcasting worldwide.
[00:33:55.479 --> 00:33:56.500]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.542]  Eastern.
[00:33:59.542 --> 00:34:00.022]  What is that?
[00:34:00.022 --> 00:34:01.083]  9 to 2 Pacific?
[00:34:01.083 --> 00:34:08.929]  10 to... I'll tell you, there's just so much going on in this world, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:13.133]  And I'm gonna attempt right now to go over a lot of the news before all these guests start joining us.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:23.885]  Let's go ahead and get back into the Trump right now.
[00:34:23.885 --> 00:34:30.149]  So I went over the fact there's a lot of news articles, mainstream news now saying, you know, you really need to go with the popular vote.
[00:34:31.492 --> 00:34:33.273]  This is not a contested deal.
[00:34:33.273 --> 00:34:34.194]  He's way ahead.
[00:34:34.194 --> 00:34:36.455]  He's going to be way ahead on the East Coast.
[00:34:36.455 --> 00:34:48.241]  What do you mean you're going to ignore the popular vote at Cleveland and maybe even give it to Paul Ryan or somebody else like Kasich?
[00:34:48.241 --> 00:34:51.982]  Because they don't really want Cruz either.
[00:34:51.982 --> 00:34:56.825]  Even though he's establishment, he hasn't been around long enough, but they might go for that.
[00:35:00.347 --> 00:35:03.768]  Sarah Palin says voters should decide GOP nominee.
[00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:05.949]  Imagine you have to even say that in America.
[00:35:05.949 --> 00:35:12.492]  Voters should decide a nominee who's then going to run for president.
[00:35:12.492 --> 00:35:14.273]  Of course!
[00:35:14.273 --> 00:35:17.714]  We're voting on the Republican we want.
[00:35:17.714 --> 00:35:25.597]  If it's appointed by a party, then the parties will just get together and create a dictatorship, a rigged deal, which they're trying to do.
[00:35:25.597 --> 00:35:28.939]  I mean, they've been joint at the hip for a long time, but this is
[00:35:29.904 --> 00:35:31.645]  Like them doing the deed in front of everybody.
[00:35:31.645 --> 00:35:42.853]  Associated Press voters will rise up in opposition to Republican power brokers, try to take the presidential nominee away from Donald Trump or Ted Cruz at the GOP convention this summer.
[00:35:42.853 --> 00:35:49.077]  Sarah Palin said Thursday in a wide-ranging interview with the Associated Press.
[00:35:49.077 --> 00:35:50.418]  I didn't even say rise up.
[00:35:50.418 --> 00:35:54.080]  I said go demonstrate for our First Amendment rights, because that's what voting is.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:57.762]  Jury rights, grand jury rights, the speech, the press, religion.
[00:35:57.762 --> 00:35:58.563]  It's all in the First Amendment.
[00:35:59.787 --> 00:36:03.930]  It's under some other amendments as well, but it's all inculcated there.
[00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:05.091]  Are they going to call her a terrorist?
[00:36:05.091 --> 00:36:05.931]  Call for her arrest?
[00:36:05.931 --> 00:36:08.533]  I mean, Roger Stone didn't say rise up.
[00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:18.239]  And they're in the Washington Post, CNN, CNBC, MSNBC calling for his arrest.
[00:36:18.239 --> 00:36:20.601]  And playing clips of this show implying I'm violent.
[00:36:21.351 --> 00:36:26.735]  News articles had me in there saying, Jones wants a day of rage, violence.
[00:36:26.735 --> 00:36:32.400]  Oh my gosh, oh yes, I'm so looking for violence, yeah right.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.463]  I'm fighting to try to stop it.
[00:36:35.463 --> 00:36:43.349]  I'm trying to stop the George Soros funded groups out there trying to start a war in the streets shooting police.
[00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:47.973]  I have Oath Keepers on that has a national initiative for Overwatch.
[00:36:49.462 --> 00:36:54.305]  For citizens and police alike so that this doesn't continue.
[00:36:54.305 --> 00:36:56.867]  And it's not about groveling to the police.
[00:36:56.867 --> 00:36:59.549]  The globalists are taking the country down.
[00:36:59.549 --> 00:37:02.511]  They want to attack local government and order.
[00:37:02.511 --> 00:37:07.614]  That's what terrorists do.
[00:37:07.614 --> 00:37:10.596]  And there's a video on InfoWars.com that needs to go mega viral.
[00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:15.010]  Drugs Report is linked to our story.
[00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:17.691]  China says Russia humiliated the arrogant U.S.
[00:37:17.691 --> 00:37:38.320]  with a simulated attack on a warship, and I'm glad drugs linked to that, but the story that's really important, and I need the listeners to, we're gonna put it on Facebook, Twitter, we need to get it out everywhere, is the videos that our crew got in Manhattan yesterday, and they're so hard working, they're already in Denver right now.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.621]  They're gonna be on in the fourth hour.
[00:37:42.022 --> 00:37:52.928]  There's a whole bunch of these videos, and because the Bernie Hillary supporters cannot talk, all they do is scream threats and cuss words, we cannot play it here.
[00:37:52.928 --> 00:37:56.410]  Because it would just be beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:59.531]  I mean, that's all it would be.
[00:37:59.531 --> 00:38:00.852]  There is a man up there
[00:38:03.675 --> 00:38:12.162]  At the Trump rally, not attacking people, but saying, defend yourself, there are sleeper cells, there is ISIS here, you need to protect yourself.
[00:38:12.162 --> 00:38:20.789]  And they start grabbing his sign, trying to rip it away, start grabbing his sunglasses, grabbing his hat, then he pushes them back, and then they attack him and beat him up.
[00:38:20.789 --> 00:38:22.690]  And the police don't do anything.
[00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:28.195]  There are police on video with some of the Black Lives Matter people saying, I'm going to attack you.
[00:38:29.899 --> 00:38:34.802]  I'm going to physically assault you and cussing at him and the police do nothing.
[00:38:34.802 --> 00:38:38.365]  I mean, it's disorderly conduct to say I'm going to physically attack you.
[00:38:38.365 --> 00:38:49.672]  And I guarantee you, I've been arrested in New York for protesting the firefighters and police not getting funding the first responders.
[00:38:49.672 --> 00:38:52.253]  I was literally protesting at Fox News over that.
[00:38:52.253 --> 00:38:53.874]  There's video of it.
[00:38:53.874 --> 00:38:57.777]  And the police came and arrested me and almost tore my shoulder out of socket.
[00:38:58.953 --> 00:39:05.978]  They put the handcuffs on so tight and so high on my back.
[00:39:05.978 --> 00:39:08.759]  And I did nothing.
[00:39:08.759 --> 00:39:09.780]  Nothing.
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:13.683]  Man, my privilege really worked out there, didn't it?
[00:39:13.683 --> 00:39:15.304]  And am I going to just hate the cops because of that?
[00:39:15.304 --> 00:39:17.765]  No, they followed their evil orders.
[00:39:17.765 --> 00:39:21.448]  They followed what that big city machine wanted.
[00:39:21.448 --> 00:39:24.430]  Just like the Black Lives Matter are allowed to beat this guy up.
[00:39:25.435 --> 00:39:32.439]  And I'm not allowed to have a demonstration about the cover-up of the dust on 9-11 and media cover-up.
[00:39:32.439 --> 00:39:34.601]  Because, see, I'm a good person.
[00:39:34.601 --> 00:39:37.222]  People are going to listen to me.
[00:39:37.222 --> 00:39:39.524]  What I'm saying will really help the country.
[00:39:39.524 --> 00:39:42.425]  So, see, I can't be allowed to be out there.
[00:39:42.425 --> 00:39:54.433]  But if I'm part of a group whose ideological leader is a cop killer that lives in Cuba, and if I go around singing chants about killing police,
[00:39:55.757 --> 00:40:08.688]  I would be allowed to tell the police that I'm going to physically attack them and menace them with my fists balled up in a fighting stance.
[00:40:08.688 --> 00:40:14.633]  No, there's a leftist George Soros privilege to destabilize this country.
[00:40:18.211 --> 00:40:30.614]  And the behavior of people like Black Lives Matter will then legitimize, and I don't think it actually does legitimize it, but it'll legitimize it in some people's minds, when crazy mentally ill cops shoot some innocent person, either white, black, or whatever, in the back.
[00:40:30.614 --> 00:40:31.294]  And that goes on.
[00:40:31.294 --> 00:40:34.635]  Those cops need to get in trouble.
[00:40:34.635 --> 00:40:38.656]  But is a couple hundred people shot a year improperly by police?
[00:40:38.656 --> 00:40:39.216]  That's the number.
[00:40:39.216 --> 00:40:39.816]  150, 200, it varies.
[00:40:39.816 --> 00:40:39.936]  Period.
[00:40:45.422 --> 00:40:47.004]  Is that the number one issue in this country?
[00:40:47.004 --> 00:40:47.564]  No.
[00:40:47.564 --> 00:40:51.408]  And you can look right at a Black Lives Matter person with all their hate and all their craziness.
[00:40:51.408 --> 00:40:57.393]  In fact, show the TV viewers some of the footage of the guy, the articles on Infowars.com.
[00:40:57.393 --> 00:41:01.477]  It's, uh, Black Lives Matter threatens to attack police.
[00:41:01.477 --> 00:41:02.238]  I believe is the headline.
[00:41:02.238 --> 00:41:03.959]  If it's not the headline, it should be.
[00:41:03.959 --> 00:41:09.644]  And the guy is just whacked out of his mind, so angry and so hateful, threatening everybody to beat him up for their free speech.
[00:41:10.731 --> 00:41:20.999]  And telling a black, black Trump supporters, how dare you be supporting him and just, just, just, just basically in a Tasmanian devil rage.
[00:41:20.999 --> 00:41:27.224]  All because he really believes that this is a bunch of racists that are out to get him.
[00:41:27.224 --> 00:41:29.286]  And the guy is so angry.
[00:41:29.286 --> 00:41:32.948]  He just keeps saying in between cuss words, Donald Trump isn't going to help.
[00:41:32.948 --> 00:41:37.292]  He's not going to raise your taxes, screaming at this black woman or group of black women.
[00:41:42.145 --> 00:41:45.687]  And then if we can, I want to show the footage when they physically attacked.
[00:41:45.687 --> 00:41:52.950]  Video, anti-Trump mob, assaults Trump supporter, leftist rip sign, throw punches at man, steal his sunglasses.
[00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:54.330]  Infowars.com.
[00:41:54.330 --> 00:42:03.715]  And then there's also... I mean, I love that these leftists cannot fight.
[00:42:03.715 --> 00:42:10.698]  I mean, I'll just tell you right now that... I mean, I'm not bragging, but I would literally have just absolutely devastated all those people in about 10 seconds.
[00:42:12.296 --> 00:42:15.837]  I mean, I just, I guess they've never had somebody actually punch him upside the head full power.
[00:42:15.837 --> 00:42:27.662]  I mean, I just, watching these people attack, it's like wimp punches and pawing and just, I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[00:42:27.662 --> 00:42:32.744]  Black Lives Matter threatens violence against whites who vote Trump.
[00:42:32.744 --> 00:42:35.005]  Yeah, that's from, that's from a few weeks ago.
[00:42:35.005 --> 00:42:36.845]  The latest one's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:42:36.845 --> 00:42:37.686]  You guys just had it up.
[00:42:37.686 --> 00:42:38.766]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:42:38.766 --> 00:42:41.267]  And it's, it's, again, we can't play because of all the cussing.
[00:42:42.833 --> 00:42:46.676]  But he tells the cops, I'm gonna knock you out.
[00:42:46.676 --> 00:42:48.477]  I'm gonna take you out.
[00:42:48.477 --> 00:42:50.778]  I'm gonna jump you.
[00:42:50.778 --> 00:42:53.480]  And they just sit there and take it.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:43:01.386]  And I've had the same New York police, I don't mean those cops, come up to me when I'm 100 yards away, showing a protest against the Iraq War and threaten to arrest me with hatred.
[00:43:02.324 --> 00:43:04.985]  I was polite to him, and the guy got off on it more.
[00:43:04.985 --> 00:43:11.966]  But see, he knows that the system is backing those leftist thugs, so they know to leave them alone.
[00:43:11.966 --> 00:43:15.807]  So I tell you, the police are shameful, and so are those thugs.
[00:43:15.807 --> 00:43:18.528]  I mean, you're all a bunch of cowards.
[00:43:18.528 --> 00:43:19.948]  I don't mean all the police, obviously.
[00:43:19.948 --> 00:43:23.929]  I'm talking about police that sit there and let people
[00:43:25.629 --> 00:43:26.770]  Do that.
[00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:32.753]  I mean, I've never seen a cop that lets you push them like that guy just did, and in their face, and then he threatens to hit them.
[00:43:32.753 --> 00:43:44.300]  It's just wrong that I've been arrested in New York and over and over again been treated like crap when I'm exercising my First Amendment that a lot of people died for!
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.682]  And because I'm a good person, I'm not allowed to.
[00:43:49.241 --> 00:43:51.022]  But a bunch of crazy people are.
[00:43:51.022 --> 00:43:53.703]  And I say let them, but don't let them beat people up.
[00:43:53.703 --> 00:43:57.284]  And the cops were 10 feet away, and let them do it.
[00:43:57.284 --> 00:44:00.725]  Because they're intimidated by it.
[00:44:00.725 --> 00:44:03.766]  They're intimidated by, what is it, four New York cops last year?
[00:44:03.766 --> 00:44:09.128]  And shot in the head, just randomly?
[00:44:09.128 --> 00:44:14.290]  I mean, if you're so scared of George Soros, these people, what's gonna happen when you start a war with the veterans and the patriots?
[00:44:15.868 --> 00:44:24.773]  And the gloves come off there if you're scared of these Black Lives Matter and communists and these other idiot groups.
[00:44:24.773 --> 00:44:25.474]  I'm digressing.
[00:44:25.474 --> 00:44:26.655]  I'm just sick of it.
[00:44:26.655 --> 00:44:31.157]  I personally am really tired of it.
[00:44:31.157 --> 00:44:32.178]  So here are these articles.
[00:44:32.178 --> 00:44:32.978]  Video.
[00:44:32.978 --> 00:44:35.120]  Violent anti-Trump mob assaults.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:38.001]  Trump supporters.
[00:44:38.001 --> 00:44:39.682]  Protesters hang Trump effigy.
[00:44:39.682 --> 00:44:45.466]  Beat up Trump impersonator outside New York GOP convention.
[00:44:51.519 --> 00:44:52.019]  Trump!
[00:44:52.019 --> 00:44:56.881]  Chalking by college Republicans is a hate crime black students claim.
[00:44:56.881 --> 00:45:00.782]  Chalking threatens our tax-exempt status.
[00:45:00.782 --> 00:45:05.484]  Oh yeah, see, no one can have speech now at a school or a church because it's tax-exempt.
[00:45:05.484 --> 00:45:09.826]  Congress shall make no law respecting an established religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:45:09.826 --> 00:45:15.988]  And individuals at a church or at a college undoubtedly have their free speech.
[00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:20.162]  Well, this is an attempt to go after our free speech.
[00:45:20.162 --> 00:45:32.144]  Bill Nye, the science guy, got asked by Mr. Moreno of Climate Depot if he agreed with the UN and others that are calling for the arrest of people that deny global warming.
[00:45:32.144 --> 00:45:32.885]  Man-made global warming?
[00:45:32.885 --> 00:45:34.025]  No, it's man-made climate change.
[00:45:34.025 --> 00:45:35.825]  And he said, no, we should look at it.
[00:45:35.825 --> 00:45:38.866]  This is the standard position.
[00:45:38.866 --> 00:45:42.487]  But look, he's a little non-threatening guy with a bowtie telling you that polar bears can't swim.
[00:45:48.891 --> 00:45:59.735]  In fact, let's play a clip of that just to dovetail with all the censorship every day that we see ongoing, the attempt to bully us into total submission.
[00:45:59.735 --> 00:46:07.117]  Science guy Bill Nye, let's discuss criminalizing climate deniers.
[00:46:07.117 --> 00:46:10.338]  And this is being pushed by the New York Attorney General and others.
[00:46:10.338 --> 00:46:14.720]  And then Barbara Boxer will play a taxed Catholic priest for questioning global warming.
[00:46:16.223 --> 00:46:18.464]  So see, it's all about being bullied.
[00:46:18.464 --> 00:46:19.884]  And what did the New York governor say?
[00:46:19.884 --> 00:46:22.805]  He said, if you're pro-gun or pro-life, get out.
[00:46:22.805 --> 00:46:23.766]  And they later said, are you serious?
[00:46:23.766 --> 00:46:26.427]  He said, yeah, get out.
[00:46:26.427 --> 00:46:27.927]  They're bullies.
[00:46:27.927 --> 00:46:30.208]  They believe their time has come.
[00:46:30.208 --> 00:46:31.888]  They're gangsters.
[00:46:31.888 --> 00:46:39.191]  And then Donald Trump comes and says, we should not have open borders and pay for everything free, and if they're not vetting any of the Muslims coming in, stop it all till it's vetted.
[00:46:42.395 --> 00:46:43.395]  Absolutely.
[00:46:43.395 --> 00:46:47.497]  And they go, oh, that's so hateful and people then get to feel hurt.
[00:46:47.497 --> 00:46:49.218]  It's like you own something now to be hurt.
[00:46:49.218 --> 00:46:50.078]  Like, I get to be hurt.
[00:46:50.078 --> 00:46:50.318]  Good.
[00:46:50.318 --> 00:46:54.500]  I get to be hurt.
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:47:05.485]  Meanwhile, Mexico gives you six months to a year hard labor if you're caught coming in from Latin America and tortures you to find out where more illegals are hiding.
[00:47:07.059 --> 00:47:09.000]  That's in the London Guardian, by the way.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.123]  No one is tougher on borders in Latin America than Mexico.
[00:47:13.123 --> 00:47:19.687]  It's one of the worst countries for illegals in the world, except for North Korea.
[00:47:19.687 --> 00:47:26.451]  I mean, they don't put up... Japan doesn't let one Muslim immigrate there.
[00:47:26.451 --> 00:47:32.555]  Japan has the lowest crime rate in that area of the world, probably the world after Switzerland, where it's hard to immigrate there, too.
[00:47:35.302 --> 00:47:36.906]  Japanese just leave their doors wide open.
[00:47:36.906 --> 00:47:38.890]  There's almost zero crime in Japan.
[00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:44.283]  Now, let's go ahead and go to Bill Nye.
[00:47:46.178 --> 00:47:50.581]  Time to talk about arresting people for their free speech.
[00:47:50.581 --> 00:47:53.102]  And he ties it to cigarettes and stuff like that.
[00:47:53.102 --> 00:47:57.425]  No, the cigarette companies knew and paid people to produce false science.
[00:47:57.425 --> 00:47:59.126]  We are saying it's the sun.
[00:47:59.126 --> 00:48:04.729]  And we're saying there's a carbon scam where you want, so you're the ones that are pushing a lie for money gain.
[00:48:04.729 --> 00:48:06.871]  You're the ones involved in racketeering, not us.
[00:48:06.871 --> 00:48:07.231]  Here it is.
[00:48:08.211 --> 00:48:14.813]  We interviewed Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the environmentalist, here at the People's Climate March in 2014, September.
[00:48:14.813 --> 00:48:23.975]  He said that the climate deniers, his word, energy CEOs belong at the Hague with three square meals and a cot with all the other war criminals.
[00:48:23.975 --> 00:48:24.755]  What is your thought on that?
[00:48:24.755 --> 00:48:29.876]  Do you think some of the rhetoric on your side, as I'm sure both sides, but some of the rhetoric on your side gets too carried away?
[00:48:29.876 --> 00:48:33.717]  I mean, what's your thought on jailing skeptics as war criminals?
[00:48:33.717 --> 00:48:35.217]  We'll see what happens.
[00:48:35.217 --> 00:48:37.658]  Was it appropriate to jail the guys from Enron?
[00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:39.630]  Interesting.
[00:48:52.091 --> 00:49:06.325]  In these cases, for me as a taxpayer and voter, the introduction of this extreme doubt, when you go with extreme doubt, about climate change is affecting my quality of life as a public citizen.
[00:49:06.325 --> 00:49:12.811]  So I can see where people are very concerned about this and are pursuing criminal investigations as well as
[00:49:15.316 --> 00:49:17.919]  As well as engaging in discussions like this.
[00:49:17.919 --> 00:49:20.042]  That is flaming tyranny.
[00:49:20.042 --> 00:49:25.909]  Now it's not just hate speech, it's extreme doubt.
[00:49:25.909 --> 00:49:30.154]  Oh, so we need to have criminal investigations of that.
[00:49:30.154 --> 00:49:33.958]  And I'm gonna do a little promo piece for this where the record skips at a key point when he says,
[00:49:35.762 --> 00:49:43.406]  Do you know who in 1990, with Al Gore at a summit, Al Gore's written about this before Enron got exposed.
[00:49:43.406 --> 00:49:49.530]  Do you know who developed carbon taxes and the global carbon trading scheme with N.M.
[00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:50.050]  Rothschild?
[00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:53.352]  This is mainstream news.
[00:49:53.352 --> 00:49:55.153]  Enron.
[00:49:55.153 --> 00:49:56.494]  Enron.
[00:49:56.494 --> 00:49:57.615]  Enron.
[00:49:57.615 --> 00:50:00.196]  It's an Enron scam.
[00:50:00.196 --> 00:50:04.979]  And then he uses their own scam organization as the reason we lose free speech.
[00:50:06.967 --> 00:50:11.631]  They fix energy prices and that wasn't enough to make a billion dollars a day sometimes in California.
[00:50:11.631 --> 00:50:12.692]  Enron environmentalism.
[00:50:12.692 --> 00:50:16.635]  The carbon credit scam pumps millions of tons more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.
[00:50:16.635 --> 00:50:17.075]  Boom.
[00:50:17.075 --> 00:50:17.756]  Mainstream article.
[00:50:17.756 --> 00:50:20.878]  Let's play the Enron clip.
[00:50:20.878 --> 00:50:22.059]  Here it is.
[00:50:22.059 --> 00:50:24.481]  Was it appropriate to jail the guys from Enron?
[00:50:26.036 --> 00:50:26.596]  Interesting.
[00:50:26.596 --> 00:50:28.737]  Okay, right, so we'll see what happens.
[00:50:28.737 --> 00:50:29.757]  Oh, you see?
[00:50:29.757 --> 00:50:31.798]  Oh, oh, oh.
[00:50:31.798 --> 00:50:37.319]  Man, you know, it's like I'll be watching CNN and they got a guy saying I'm dangerous and bad, don't listen to me.
[00:50:37.319 --> 00:50:43.421]  And I go, wait a minute, I remember reading about an analyst at the Pentagon running a bunch of stuff, a Buck Sexton.
[00:50:43.421 --> 00:50:44.602]  I think that guy's CIA.
[00:50:44.602 --> 00:50:46.182]  When we look him up, he's CIA.
[00:50:46.182 --> 00:50:49.543]  They don't get on TV and say, hey, I'm CIA up here going after Alex Jones.
[00:50:49.543 --> 00:50:55.105]  But see, I remember, I remember, and I remember who came up with the carbon scam, Bill Nye.
[00:50:56.375 --> 00:50:57.621]  Man, you're an enemy of freedom.
[00:50:57.621 --> 00:50:58.425]  What a tyrant!
[00:51:00.279 --> 00:51:05.563]  There's nothing more enticing and intoxicating than the finest meat cooking on an open flame.

[00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:02.271]  Hello, I'm Michael Reagan.
[00:52:02.271 --> 00:52:15.201]  My father, President Ronald Reagan, believed so strongly in gold that he changed gold ownership forever by bringing back physical gold to the American public, allowing gold coins to be minted and sold to U.S.
[00:52:15.201 --> 00:52:17.642]  citizens just like you, starting in 1985.
[00:52:18.883 --> 00:52:25.825]  Gold ownership can help protect your financial future, especially when our national debt is spiraling out of control.
[00:52:25.825 --> 00:52:33.847]  Many smart Americans have kept their retirements from being wiped out during America's financial crisis thanks to physical gold coins.
[00:52:33.847 --> 00:52:36.487]  I strongly urge you to call the U.S.
[00:52:36.487 --> 00:52:39.388]  Money Reserve at 1-866-944-GOLD or go online to usmoneyreserve.com

[00:52:57.357 --> 00:52:58.538]  I'm Michael Reagan.
[00:52:58.538 --> 00:52:58.898]  Thank you.
[00:53:00.942 --> 00:53:03.464]  Think body armor is just for commandos?
[00:53:03.464 --> 00:53:04.444]  Think again.
[00:53:04.444 --> 00:53:08.046]  In a collapse situation, you need to protect your entire family.
[00:53:08.046 --> 00:53:14.050]  Infidel Body Armor has created lightweight armor that repels AR-15 and AK-47 rounds.

[00:53:31.479 --> 00:53:34.980]  You understand how big government and corporations are controlling you.
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:35.680]  Guess what?

[00:54:17.373 --> 00:54:19.394]  A new story up on DrugsReport.com.
[00:54:19.394 --> 00:54:23.516]  It's also on Infowars.com.
[00:54:23.516 --> 00:54:25.617]  From Breitbart.
[00:54:25.617 --> 00:54:33.982]  Colorado caucus volunteers ballot errors hurt Trump delegation and candidates could have violated state rules.
[00:54:33.982 --> 00:54:37.683]  Yeah, where you're only allowed to vote for Ted Cruz even though you're already all vetted.
[00:54:37.683 --> 00:54:40.105]  Most of them had promised to go for Cruz.
[00:54:40.105 --> 00:54:41.705]  They wanted a hundred percent victory.
[00:54:41.705 --> 00:54:44.587]  So they were so arrogant they gave him every delegate.
[00:54:46.986 --> 00:54:49.468]  And then they went on TV and gaslighted us.
[00:54:49.468 --> 00:54:53.750]  That's a CIA term for just saying, you're not on planet Earth.
[00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:54.831]  You're not Alex Jones.
[00:54:54.831 --> 00:54:55.851]  You're not Matt Drudge.
[00:54:55.851 --> 00:55:00.154]  You're not, you know, whoever you are, John Brown.
[00:55:00.154 --> 00:55:02.115]  You're not who you say, and you're like, yeah, I am.
[00:55:02.115 --> 00:55:03.236]  No, you're crazy.
[00:55:03.236 --> 00:55:05.057]  And a roomful of people tell you you're nuts.
[00:55:05.057 --> 00:55:07.498]  This is not voting for primaries.
[00:55:07.498 --> 00:55:10.700]  There never was, silly.
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:11.120]  Silly.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:13.782]  We're going to get into that more.
[00:55:16.892 --> 00:55:26.315]  I want to get more into this whole climate change situation with Barbara Boxer where it's all about shaming us now and nudging us and hen-pecking us and dominating us and we may have to arrest you.
[00:55:26.315 --> 00:55:30.016]  Yeah, we're going to go shut down the Trump rallies too.
[00:55:30.016 --> 00:55:38.579]  We're going to beat up people and the cops aren't going to do anything even though we run around these groups calling for attacking the police.
[00:55:38.579 --> 00:55:40.220]  Because it's what the establishment wants.
[00:55:42.361 --> 00:55:44.002]  Obviously our crews are all over the place.
[00:55:44.002 --> 00:55:44.943]  We're working very hard.
[00:55:44.943 --> 00:55:50.167]  We're trying to fund coverage in Cleveland and Bilderberg coming up next month and so much more.
[00:55:50.167 --> 00:55:53.370]  We've got the best products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:55:53.370 --> 00:56:01.176]  The best nutraceuticals, the best pro-gun, anti-globalist apparel so you can meet like-minded people and spread the word.
[00:56:01.176 --> 00:56:05.139]  We have an unprecedented 25% off the already discounted.
[00:56:05.139 --> 00:56:06.660]  So you have retail, then you have discounted.
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:08.262]  It's 25% off discounted.
[00:56:08.262 --> 00:56:10.704]  It's 45% off retail on BrainForce.
[00:56:12.125 --> 00:56:22.036]  And I'm telling you, folks, at $22, similar nootropics have fillers in them and are a bigger bottle, cost $60.
[00:56:22.036 --> 00:56:25.279]  We have less caplets in it, and it has a lower price.
[00:56:25.279 --> 00:56:30.986]  But if we did the fillers and stuff, it'd be a huge bottle and have more caplets in it, but we don't do fillers, and it'd be $60. $22.
[00:56:36.556 --> 00:56:47.384]  Okay, so it is 45% off its regular retail, and it's got the 30 caplets in it, and just try it out today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:47.384 --> 00:56:51.266]  A lot of folks want to be able to get a bigger bottle at a higher price, we're coming out with one of those.
[00:56:51.266 --> 00:56:53.448]  A little bit of discount on that as well.
[00:56:53.448 --> 00:56:57.331]  But this is the best Nootropic we could come up with, the best formula, period.
[00:56:57.751 --> 00:57:01.632]  We go out and find what is the most organic, what is the safest, what is the most hardcore.

[00:57:52.092 --> 00:57:53.712]  Best of times, worst of times.
[00:57:53.712 --> 00:58:02.235]  I have never had more demonic enemy attacks of every form and every level and I literally rely on God and I pray for your prayers.
[00:58:02.235 --> 00:58:03.815]  I need your prayers.
[00:58:03.815 --> 00:58:05.676]  And I need providence.
[00:58:05.676 --> 00:58:07.176]  I'm committed, I'm going to do everything I've got to do.
[00:58:07.176 --> 00:58:10.237]  I'm not going to stop, ever.
[00:58:10.237 --> 00:58:12.117]  I just need your support and your prayers and I appreciate it.
[00:58:12.117 --> 00:58:15.718]  And so do our affiliates and everybody else that supports the InfoWarrant.
[00:58:15.718 --> 00:58:17.959]  Lord knows I'm not perfect, but I'm doing the best I can before God.
[00:58:19.059 --> 00:58:20.880]  People say, man, why all the God stuff?
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.242]  Look, I believe in God.
[00:58:23.242 --> 00:58:24.423]  It's how I cope, okay?
[00:58:24.423 --> 00:58:25.684]  There are no atheists and foxholes.
[00:58:25.684 --> 00:58:30.287]  And let me tell you, live my life and then just... I couldn't do this if I didn't have God to lean on.
[00:58:30.287 --> 00:58:33.429]  And that's what it comes down to.
[00:58:33.429 --> 00:58:36.571]  I just get stronger as the attacks intensify, though, because God's a rock.
[00:58:36.571 --> 00:58:38.533]  The closer I get to God, the stronger I get.
[00:58:38.533 --> 00:58:39.053]  We'll be back.

[00:59:52.072 --> 01:00:02.798]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:02.798 --> 01:00:09.422]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:09.422 --> 01:00:12.404]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:20.814 --> 01:00:23.476]  We're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:00:23.476 --> 01:00:25.617]  Larry Nichols is popping in with breaking news.
[01:00:25.617 --> 01:00:27.398]  Colonel Rob Maness running for Senate.
[01:00:27.398 --> 01:00:29.020]  Louisiana is popping in.
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:34.443]  Peter Schiff, Rob Dew is going to be on the road with the rest of the crew, Joe Biggs and others.
[01:00:34.443 --> 01:00:36.545]  Coming up in the fourth hour with David Knight.
[01:00:37.637 --> 01:00:40.199]  They were going to be on the third hour, but they're really sleepy.
[01:00:40.199 --> 01:00:43.101]  They just got in from New York, and were up until two in the morning last night.
[01:00:43.101 --> 01:00:44.902]  Flew out at seven a.m.
[01:00:44.902 --> 01:00:48.244]  this morning out of New York, and so they're in Denver taking a nap right now.
[01:00:48.244 --> 01:00:51.406]  The demonstration starts at, what is it, four o'clock?
[01:00:51.406 --> 01:00:54.848]  No, three o'clock Mountain Standard Time.
[01:00:54.848 --> 01:00:58.091]  Three o'clock Mountain, so that's four o'clock here.
[01:00:58.091 --> 01:01:04.535]  So we're talking about four hours, and they're going to be covering that live, live feeds on the Skype.
[01:01:06.061 --> 01:01:16.343]  In fact, I suggest that, I should have told you guys this earlier, we probably just need to go ahead and boot things up and maybe just stream over our own systems there.
[01:01:16.343 --> 01:01:19.184]  Or they can use Ustream or whatever for their safety.
[01:01:19.184 --> 01:01:28.926]  But so many of the anti-Trump folks are attacking cameras and they've also promised to dress up in Infowars outfits to provocateur us.
[01:01:28.926 --> 01:01:30.246]  We have that from inside sources.
[01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:35.894]  So we'll know their names, we'll know what group they came from.
[01:01:35.894 --> 01:01:50.549]  God knows if the police will do anything though in this country, because I guess if you're an American patriot and follow the law and are a good person, and you're against shooting police in the back of the head, you don't get any police support.
[01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:52.331]  At least in these places like Denver and New York.
[01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:58.622]  I've been attacked in Denver by the stupid anarchist people, communists.
[01:01:58.622 --> 01:02:00.363]  Everything with them is a lie.
[01:02:00.363 --> 01:02:05.487]  You know, they'll call themselves anarchists and they got communist tattoos and red flags and hammers and sickles.
[01:02:05.487 --> 01:02:13.352]  Because their bosses tell them, there's no communism, we don't want the public to know we're communists, so call yourselves an anarchist.
[01:02:13.352 --> 01:02:17.715]  And they're always in black and they always talk about killing babies and how they love the devil and how they love being ugly.
[01:02:20.664 --> 01:02:22.965]  Who do these people come from?
[01:02:22.965 --> 01:02:26.065]  Why is there so much garbage out there?
[01:02:26.065 --> 01:02:29.346]  I don't understand all these people that love evil.
[01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:30.966]  I know one thing though.
[01:02:30.966 --> 01:02:36.887]  They take our restraint for weakness and man, I tell you, you really are pushing it hard.
[01:02:36.887 --> 01:02:38.287]  That's all I'm going to tell you right now.
[01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:40.068]  You're really pushing it hard.
[01:02:40.068 --> 01:02:43.548]  All you evil people, you're going to get it.
[01:02:43.548 --> 01:02:45.949]  Just know that sooner or later God's going to cut you down.
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:53.323]  But maybe we should come in with that Johnny Cash.
[01:02:53.323 --> 01:02:56.526]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:02:56.526 --> 01:02:59.689]  Run on for a long time.
[01:02:59.689 --> 01:03:02.792]  Sooner or later, I'm gonna cut you down.
[01:03:02.792 --> 01:03:04.654]  Sooner or later, God's gonna cut you down.
[01:03:04.654 --> 01:03:11.300]  Yeah, plotting in the dark against your fellow man.
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:13.182]  What's done in the dark will be brought to light.
[01:03:20.086 --> 01:03:29.492]  I already played Bill Nye the Science Guy saying, yeah, we should look at arresting people that don't believe in man-made global climate change, don't want to pay their good carbon taxes, because Enron was a scam.
[01:03:29.492 --> 01:03:32.654]  Well, Enron was engaged in energy trading fraud.
[01:03:32.654 --> 01:03:33.434]  What does that mean?
[01:03:33.434 --> 01:03:43.280]  Enron created the carbon tax scam with Al Gore, and the Rothschilds on record.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.601]  The irony of these people.
[01:03:46.991 --> 01:03:48.493]  The criminality of it.
[01:03:48.493 --> 01:03:53.097]  But let's play Barbara Boxer, Italian Catholic priest for questioning global warming.
[01:03:53.097 --> 01:03:55.339]  Let's play that clip.
[01:03:55.339 --> 01:03:57.441]  This is one of the greatest moral crimes.
[01:03:57.441 --> 01:04:05.970]  If you make energy more expensive or you prohibit or restrict people from getting energy from sources like coal, that's literally death.
[01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:07.652]  Mr. Epstein, are you a scientist?
[01:04:08.755 --> 01:04:09.375]  No.
[01:04:09.375 --> 01:04:10.236]  Philosopher.
[01:04:10.236 --> 01:04:11.376]  You're a philosopher?
[01:04:11.376 --> 01:04:12.076]  Yes.
[01:04:12.076 --> 01:04:12.436]  Okay.
[01:04:12.436 --> 01:04:13.197]  That money's a listener.
[01:04:13.197 --> 01:04:14.037]  Is that true?
[01:04:14.037 --> 01:04:14.877]  That's what Lord Monckton says.
[01:04:14.877 --> 01:04:16.598]  This is the Environment and Public Works Committee.
[01:04:16.598 --> 01:04:19.939]  I think it's interesting we have a philosopher here talking about an issue.
[01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:21.620]  It's to teach you how to think more clearly.
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.081]  Well, you don't have to teach me how to think more clearly.
[01:04:24.081 --> 01:04:25.241]  Yeah, she's got an internet on this channel.
[01:04:25.241 --> 01:04:28.502]  Try running for the Senate on your platform.
[01:04:28.502 --> 01:04:34.284]  Reverend Nelson, perhaps the most... Well, this is the place to have a philosopher, not a scientist.
[01:04:34.284 --> 01:04:35.265]  It's perfect for this...
[01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:38.427]  You have to integrate the big picture data.
[01:04:38.427 --> 01:04:40.168]  I'm not asking you anything.
[01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:50.216]  I'm telling you that all you have to know is you're a philosopher, not a scientist, and I don't appreciate getting lectured by a philosopher about science.
[01:04:50.216 --> 01:04:53.039]  Now, I want to talk to... I can ask you what I want.
[01:04:53.039 --> 01:04:55.701]  Do you disagree with the Pope on climate change?
[01:04:55.701 --> 01:04:57.082]  It's a simple yes or no.
[01:04:57.082 --> 01:04:58.843]  When the Pope says... We'll be back.
[01:04:58.843 --> 01:04:59.304]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:08.383]  A seismologist warns that catastrophic mega-earthquakes are on their way after five major earthquakes took place in the last 48 hours.
[01:05:08.383 --> 01:05:19.867]  Seismologist Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado has made headlines all over the world by warning that current conditions might trigger at least four earthquakes greater than 8.0 in magnitude.
[01:05:19.867 --> 01:05:26.709]  If his projections are accurate, our planet could be on the precipice of a wave of natural disasters unlike anything that any of us have witnessed before.
[01:05:26.929 --> 01:05:32.834]  A single magnitude 8.0 earthquake in a populated area would be a disaster of historic proportions.
[01:05:32.834 --> 01:05:33.855]  But four of them?
[01:05:33.855 --> 01:05:35.997]  That would be a complete and utter nightmare.
[01:05:35.997 --> 01:05:41.421]  And according to Volcano Discovery, 38 volcanoes around the globe are erupting right now.
[01:05:41.421 --> 01:05:42.382]  Michael Snyder asks,
[01:05:42.622 --> 01:05:43.783]  Why is this happening?
[01:05:43.783 --> 01:05:47.664]  Why is the crust of the earth shaking so violently all of a sudden?
[01:05:47.664 --> 01:05:53.267]  In Matthew 24, Jesus warned us that there would be earthquakes in diverse places just prior to his return.
[01:05:53.267 --> 01:05:57.109]  Are we truly in the times the Bible refers to as the last days?

[01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:00.811]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:06:00.811 --> 01:06:01.392]  Good, brother.

[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.703]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.

[01:06:27.074 --> 01:06:30.116]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:06:30.116 --> 01:06:31.757]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:06:31.757 --> 01:06:34.199]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[01:06:34.599 --> 01:06:39.604]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:06:39.604 --> 01:06:51.615]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience where it's stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:18.588]  I don't
[01:07:33.285 --> 01:07:36.366]  We also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[01:07:36.366 --> 01:07:39.188]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:52.114]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of Survival Shield nascent iodine, that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.

[01:08:15.277 --> 01:08:18.218]  Run on for a long time.
[01:08:18.218 --> 01:08:21.100]  Run on for a long time.

[01:08:28.681 --> 01:08:43.411]  Go tell that long-tongue liar Go and tell that midnight rider Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter Tell him that God's gonna cut him down Tell him that God's gonna cut him down
[01:08:48.519 --> 01:09:13.918]  Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news My head's been wet with the midnight dews I've been down on bended knee Talking to the man from Galilee He spoke to me with a voice so sweet I thought I heard the shuffle of angels sing He called my name and my heart stood still When he said, John, go do my will Go tell that long-tongued liar
[01:09:14.799 --> 01:09:29.028]  We live in a very epic time on this world right now.
[01:09:29.028 --> 01:09:31.369]  Everybody can see it.
[01:09:31.369 --> 01:09:34.251]  And Larry Nichols is somebody that saw it.
[01:09:34.251 --> 01:09:41.175]  Green Beret, Commando, all over the world fighting communists, recruited into the shadow government.
[01:09:41.175 --> 01:09:43.137]  Dixie Mafia, that's what it is in the South.
[01:09:44.235 --> 01:09:52.801]  Brought the Clintons into power, was there, saw me in Arkansas, the drug deal, and the dead kids, and said I'm not going to be part of it anymore, and went public against them.
[01:09:52.801 --> 01:10:00.627]  And he's the guy that helped bring forward the information that began the impeachment, and he's the fella that got ostracized, demonized, and attacked by these folks.
[01:10:04.150 --> 01:10:08.932]  Larry Nichols is our guest here today, just for the next 20 minutes or so.
[01:10:08.932 --> 01:10:11.053]  He's got some breaking news and intel for us.
[01:10:11.053 --> 01:10:15.175]  Then we have a man running for Senate, Colonel Rob Maness, popping in.
[01:10:15.175 --> 01:10:17.216]  Peter Schiff on what's happening with the economy.
[01:10:17.216 --> 01:10:19.817]  We've got Rob doing the rest of our crew from Denver.
[01:10:19.817 --> 01:10:21.518]  They'll be at the site of the demonstration.
[01:10:21.518 --> 01:10:25.040]  We'll see all the InfoWarriors converge on that, on the West Steps.
[01:10:26.144 --> 01:10:30.948]  of the Colorado State Capitol building, 200 each, Colfax Avenue, Denver, Colorado.
[01:10:30.948 --> 01:10:36.713]  And they're going to be in Portland, where the left has said no one is allowed to be there for the student groups to speak.
[01:10:36.713 --> 01:10:37.894]  No Trump supporters are allowed.
[01:10:37.894 --> 01:10:39.716]  They attacked them last week.
[01:10:39.716 --> 01:10:42.017]  Six Trump supporters peacefully there.
[01:10:42.017 --> 01:10:47.202]  And so our crew is going as listed speakers to speak to their group, and we'll be there and witness what happens.
[01:10:47.202 --> 01:10:49.023]  Hope you come there and support the First Amendment.
[01:10:49.023 --> 01:10:52.747]  We expect the college to actually help them attack the crew.
[01:10:52.747 --> 01:10:53.387]  The crew is ready.
[01:10:53.387 --> 01:10:53.948]  They wanted to go.
[01:10:55.707 --> 01:10:57.168]  To illustrate, they'll be like Gandhi.
[01:10:57.168 --> 01:11:02.231]  I mean, I've told them, let them hit you if you want, or defend yourself, but they're going to let them hit them first.
[01:11:02.231 --> 01:11:04.593]  They're there, and I'm sure it'll be on the news that we're evil and bad.
[01:11:04.593 --> 01:11:10.337]  This is something Joe Biggs and Rob Dewey and others want to be part of, and defend the First Amendment.
[01:11:12.047 --> 01:11:14.748]  The good news is a lot of CBS News, U.S.
[01:11:14.748 --> 01:11:19.611]  News & World Report, even Associated Press are going, you know, you really should count votes and primaries.
[01:11:19.611 --> 01:11:22.852]  This is not something that's been done before where you just ignore them.
[01:11:22.852 --> 01:11:24.173]  Now stop it.
[01:11:24.173 --> 01:11:25.273]  This is a dictatorship.
[01:11:25.273 --> 01:11:25.633]  Quit.
[01:11:25.633 --> 01:11:26.934]  So the public didn't buy it.
[01:11:26.934 --> 01:11:28.534]  The mainstream media tried to sell it.
[01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:29.135]  It didn't work.
[01:11:29.135 --> 01:11:31.116]  So now they're backing off that a little bit.
[01:11:31.116 --> 01:11:36.278]  Doesn't mean they still won't try to steal it, but it's a... Sarah Palin said there should be an uprising, basically.
[01:11:36.278 --> 01:11:40.840]  I didn't say that and accuse myself and Stone of... Roger Stone trying to call for a war.
[01:11:42.179 --> 01:11:43.880]  We're going to win in the info war, folks.
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.042]  We don't want it to go physical.
[01:11:46.042 --> 01:11:48.584]  Of course, if it does, we're going to win that, too.
[01:11:48.584 --> 01:11:52.447]  But our guest is Larry Nichols, and Larry is having trouble speaking today.
[01:11:52.447 --> 01:11:55.749]  He is battling cancer, and folks should pray for him.
[01:11:55.749 --> 01:11:58.251]  He has his oxygen tubes out right now.
[01:11:58.251 --> 01:12:03.695]  He had a tracheotomy last time he was on with us, so he's a tough old bird, and we love him.
[01:12:03.695 --> 01:12:06.457]  Larry, good to have you here with us, my friend.
[01:12:06.457 --> 01:12:06.918]  Hey, man.
[01:12:06.918 --> 01:12:07.698]  How are you?
[01:12:07.698 --> 01:12:08.399]  How are you doing?
[01:12:08.399 --> 01:12:09.359]  I'm doing good, my friend.
[01:12:09.359 --> 01:12:09.880]  How are you doing?
[01:12:11.167 --> 01:12:11.547]  I'm here.
[01:12:11.547 --> 01:12:12.748]  I'm here.
[01:12:12.748 --> 01:12:19.853]  Listen, Alex, I'm here today because I've got to make an announcement.
[01:12:19.853 --> 01:12:24.836]  They're not going to let Trump have, they're not going to let him have the nomination.
[01:12:24.836 --> 01:12:27.037]  Donald Trump has a move that he can make.
[01:12:27.037 --> 01:12:28.758]  I've tried every way I know how.
[01:12:28.758 --> 01:12:31.200]  I know you have to get Trump in touch with me.
[01:12:32.017 --> 01:12:34.238]  It's not something I've made up.
[01:12:34.238 --> 01:12:36.198]  It's not something I've hypothesized.
[01:12:36.198 --> 01:12:38.179]  Well, some of what we talk about does get to him.
[01:12:38.179 --> 01:12:40.059]  Some of what we talk about does get to him.
[01:12:40.059 --> 01:12:40.640]  I can tell you that.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:41.200]  I understand.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:41.580]  Go ahead.
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:43.580]  I understand.
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:52.363]  What Donald Trump should do, and I mean he should do it this weekend, he should hold a press conference and he should say, I'm not doing it for me.
[01:12:52.363 --> 01:12:55.364]  I'm doing it on behalf of the American people.
[01:12:55.364 --> 01:12:58.245]  I'm bringing my cadre of attorneys in.
[01:12:58.245 --> 01:12:59.425]  I'm paying for them.
[01:13:00.407 --> 01:13:06.530]  And I'm filing theft by deception lawsuit against the RNC.
[01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:10.313]  Now, I know there'll be attorneys that say, oh, that's crazy.
[01:13:10.313 --> 01:13:11.954]  You can't sue the RNC.
[01:13:11.954 --> 01:13:17.517]  Well, I was told, if you'll remember Alex, I couldn't sue the president either with Paula Jones.
[01:13:17.517 --> 01:13:19.438]  By God, I did.
[01:13:19.438 --> 01:13:23.500]  And by God, we got him under oath and he lied and we got him for perjury.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:26.562]  That's what got him impeached.
[01:13:26.562 --> 01:13:28.523]  And he needs to say very clearly,
[01:13:29.631 --> 01:13:33.693]  That the attorneys I hire, we're filing the lawsuit.
[01:13:33.693 --> 01:13:37.354]  It should be filed under criminal court.
[01:13:37.354 --> 01:13:40.155]  But we know Obama and the criminal people, they're not going to do that.
[01:13:40.155 --> 01:13:43.037]  So you're going to have to file it civilly.
[01:13:43.037 --> 01:13:46.838]  And then Alex, within three weeks, he should make it known.
[01:13:46.838 --> 01:13:58.103]  Karl Rove, Rince Priebus, Paul Ryan, et al., whoever else, Mitt Romney, that within three weeks,
[01:13:59.092 --> 01:14:04.437]  He plans to have his attorneys have them under deposition, under discovery.
[01:14:04.437 --> 01:14:19.128]  Well, Paul Manafort, who pretty much runs his campaign now and is coming on very soon, he went on, as you know, meet the press a week ago and said that they are looking, quote, at filing complaints and lawsuits, and I actually believe it's going in that direction.
[01:14:19.128 --> 01:14:21.990]  Regardless, just to point out, we're saying this is fraud.
[01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:23.952]  We're saying people should be allowed to vote in America.
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:25.740]  Right.
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:30.062]  Well, this is a technical point of law.
[01:14:30.062 --> 01:14:42.768]  I mean, number one, the RNC reached one bridge too far, Alex, when they went and had Louisiana, Colorado, and a couple of other states prematurely go ahead and take delegate votes from Trump.
[01:14:42.768 --> 01:14:49.951]  Had they have waited until one week, six days before the convention, there'd have been nothing anybody could do, Alex.
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:58.843]  The executive committee, rules committee, could have had their meeting six days before the convention, fixed it to still... I totally agree with you.
[01:14:58.843 --> 01:15:09.148]  The way the rules are written, they could try some hanky-panky up around the convention, but the fact that they did it prematurely, or just cancelled caucuses altogether, is amazing.
[01:15:09.148 --> 01:15:13.689]  Well, and remember Alex, to the people, y'all listen to me.
[01:15:13.689 --> 01:15:16.711]  And Trump, listen to me, dammit, listen to me.
[01:15:16.711 --> 01:15:19.692]  There are people that have stood in line hours
[01:15:20.273 --> 01:15:22.333]  Hours to hear you speak.
[01:15:22.333 --> 01:15:27.114]  There are people that have gone through great difficulty to go out and vote for you.
[01:15:27.114 --> 01:15:34.996]  Now, these Republicans, executives, they have no intention of letting you have the nomination.
[01:15:34.996 --> 01:15:37.236]  I don't care if you go in.
[01:15:37.236 --> 01:15:48.958]  Alex, I've already told you, there was an executive meeting where they discussed, if he gets 1,237 down to 1,200, they're giving it to Kasich so they minimize the blowback.
[01:15:50.183 --> 01:15:53.466]  Look, guys, this stuff's been going on a long time.
[01:15:53.466 --> 01:15:54.587]  It has.
[01:15:54.587 --> 01:16:00.833]  But you see, when Trump got in the race, Alex, what changed this whole dynamic from years, years past?
[01:16:00.833 --> 01:16:05.377]  Normally, you remember I told you this months and years ago.
[01:16:05.377 --> 01:16:09.821]  In primaries, who has the most money always wins.
[01:16:09.821 --> 01:16:15.767]  So what the Republicans have always done to trick the elections, they get about 10 candidates to run in the beginning.
[01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:18.491]  They run all those jobs off.
[01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:20.071]  They use up all their money.
[01:16:20.071 --> 01:16:24.593]  And then the only one left is the establishment candidate that has all the money in the world.
[01:16:24.593 --> 01:16:27.874]  In this case, it was supposed to be Bush.
[01:16:27.874 --> 01:16:29.274]  But here comes Trump.
[01:16:29.274 --> 01:16:31.115]  Trump don't need their money.
[01:16:31.115 --> 01:16:33.496]  And all of those rules broke down.
[01:16:33.496 --> 01:16:39.778]  Now they're forced to go out in public and do it right in front of everybody's eyes.
[01:16:39.778 --> 01:16:43.579]  If he will do this, if he will do this, I assure him
[01:16:45.234 --> 01:16:50.076]  He will get the nominee, nomination for the RNC.
[01:16:50.076 --> 01:17:06.803]  They can't stop him because what'll happen, you know this Alex, we get Karl Rove and the boys in the box under oath and start asking them some questions like, golly gee, did y'all get together and communicate with the Louisiana Executive Committee?
[01:17:06.803 --> 01:17:10.445]  Did y'all by chance talk to and conspire?
[01:17:11.388 --> 01:17:14.971]  With the Colorado RNC.
[01:17:14.971 --> 01:17:21.835]  Find out, make them say, under oath, what they did or did not do and if.
[01:17:21.835 --> 01:17:28.380]  And I'll say this to Rex Priebus and Karl Rove and all you pumpkin heads, listen to me.
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:33.543]  Everything Hillary Rodham Clinton has on every one of you.
[01:17:33.543 --> 01:17:36.105]  Some of you will put you in jail.
[01:17:36.105 --> 01:17:39.247]  All of you, it'll make you awfully ashamed of your name.
[01:17:39.247 --> 01:17:40.548]  Everything she's got, I got.
[01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:44.284]  And I swear to you, I will use it.
[01:17:44.284 --> 01:17:45.145]  I'm going to use it.
[01:17:45.145 --> 01:17:49.065]  Now, the best thing everybody can do can zip this thing up.
[01:17:49.065 --> 01:17:50.826]  Trump can get his act together.
[01:17:50.826 --> 01:17:54.607]  I don't need him to bring in these pros from Dover, Alex.
[01:17:54.607 --> 01:18:00.808]  You know, he can bring in that guy you're talking about and all these other guys that can count delegates and all the other.
[01:18:00.808 --> 01:18:07.069]  I know when the fix is in, I know how it works, and I know what they're planning.
[01:18:07.069 --> 01:18:11.390]  They figure that even if they steal it from Trump, Hillary will get it.
[01:18:13.374 --> 01:18:15.178]  And then, you know what?
[01:18:15.178 --> 01:18:16.421]  They'll do what they've done before.
[01:18:16.421 --> 01:18:19.547]  Look, if you're a good Republican, do you want to vote for Hillary?
[01:18:19.547 --> 01:18:21.271]  Okay, yeah, you want a Trump.
[01:18:22.088 --> 01:18:24.009]  But the guy we got's not Hillary.
[01:18:24.009 --> 01:18:25.669]  And that's how they think this is going to go.
[01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:27.770]  Put him under oath, Alex.
[01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:28.490]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:29.391]  That's a great plan.
[01:18:29.391 --> 01:18:31.551]  And I think something similar is being looked at.
[01:18:31.551 --> 01:18:33.472]  Why are the Republicans so arrogant?
[01:18:33.472 --> 01:18:37.473]  Or is it desperateness to openly cancel elections in different states?
[01:18:37.473 --> 01:18:41.355]  And like Trump wins all these states and suddenly we hear he's lost.
[01:18:41.355 --> 01:18:43.595]  And Hillary's doing it to Sanders.
[01:18:43.595 --> 01:18:45.796]  Sounds like the two parties have gotten together at the top.
[01:18:45.796 --> 01:18:46.957]  We know they have against the Tea Party.
[01:18:46.957 --> 01:18:50.618]  And have decided to just steal it together and to cover each other's backs.
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:55.281]  Alex, this is the last election we're gonna have.
[01:18:55.281 --> 01:18:56.601]  Y'all, this is the last election.
[01:18:56.601 --> 01:18:58.102]  No, no, you were saying that a year ago.
[01:18:58.102 --> 01:18:59.722]  You were saying that a year ago.
[01:18:59.722 --> 01:19:00.762]  Yeah, look what's going on.
[01:19:00.762 --> 01:19:06.283]  You've got Biden and Obama and the head of the Federal Reserve meeting this week.
[01:19:06.283 --> 01:19:13.745]  Did you know it's a matter of national security those three are never to be in the same room away from the Capitol security?
[01:19:13.745 --> 01:19:14.726]  But they were.
[01:19:14.726 --> 01:19:16.146]  One of the things they talked about.
[01:19:16.146 --> 01:19:18.066]  This was in Reuters.
[01:19:18.066 --> 01:19:20.047]  This isn't me saying it, Alex.
[01:19:20.047 --> 01:19:20.827]  It was in Reuters.
[01:19:21.570 --> 01:19:27.532]  They were discussing martial law in case of a global meltdown.
[01:19:27.532 --> 01:19:34.514]  Then you've got the monetary fund, global monetary fund people meeting in New York.
[01:19:34.514 --> 01:19:35.975]  They're coming in trying to
[01:19:36.678 --> 01:19:40.342]  Take and go back into... Yeah, let's talk about the state of the world.
[01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:41.603]  Absolutely.
[01:19:41.603 --> 01:19:42.023]  Stay there Larry.
[01:19:42.023 --> 01:19:45.847]  They're not doing desperate stuff, I agree, here and all over the world for no reason.
[01:19:45.847 --> 01:19:49.671]  They know stuff's coming so big, we won't even remember all the stuff they're doing now.
[01:19:49.671 --> 01:19:52.593]  I'm telling you folks, my spidey sense is pegging.
[01:19:52.593 --> 01:19:54.996]  I mean, it's like the RPMs are just off the chart.
[01:19:54.996 --> 01:19:55.656]  I can feel it.
[01:19:55.656 --> 01:19:56.918]  I can see it.
[01:19:56.918 --> 01:19:57.418]  Woo!
[01:19:57.418 --> 01:19:59.020]  Man, I tell you, better get right with God, folks.

[01:21:59.804 --> 01:22:01.865]  Hello, I'm Michael Reagan.
[01:22:01.865 --> 01:22:14.769]  My father, President Ronald Reagan, believed so strongly in gold that he changed gold ownership forever by bringing back physical gold to the American public, allowing gold coins to be minted and sold to U.S.
[01:22:14.769 --> 01:22:17.230]  citizens just like you, starting in 1985.
[01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:25.414]  Gold ownership can help protect your financial future, especially when our national debt is spiraling out of control.
[01:22:25.414 --> 01:22:33.439]  Many smart Americans have kept their retirements from being wiped out during America's financial crisis thanks to physical gold coins.
[01:22:33.439 --> 01:22:36.081]  I strongly urge you to call the U.S.
[01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:38.963]  Money Reserve at 1-866-944-GOLD or go online to usmoneyreserve.com

[01:22:59.093 --> 01:23:02.395]  The final phase of extermination is set to commence now.
[01:23:02.395 --> 01:23:07.879]  And as population die-off becomes evident, you know it is the time of punishment in all that is written.
[01:23:07.879 --> 01:23:14.104]  The cover for mass die-off is evolution and global warming frauds, also used as false proof of their Christ.
[01:23:14.104 --> 01:23:17.746]  They are from the lines that were disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:23:17.746 --> 01:23:22.610]  Now they claim to be his Christ, based upon blood type, DNA, and long lifespan.

[01:24:50.128 --> 01:24:57.531]  Sounds like an angel's voice.
[01:24:57.531 --> 01:25:01.993]  Coming up after our guest leaves us, phone transcripts prove Hillary lied about Benghazi attack.
[01:25:01.993 --> 01:25:03.834]  Breaking InfoWars.com
[01:25:06.624 --> 01:25:09.605]  Another exclusive article, it's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:15.487]  Colorado caucus volunteers, ballot errors, hurt Trump delegate candidates, could have violated state rules.
[01:25:15.487 --> 01:25:22.649]  Well, yeah, they just, even the few that wanted to vote, who hadn't already been bought off, were unable to because the ballots were just for the other guy.
[01:25:22.649 --> 01:25:25.090]  I mean, wow, they really are getting arrogant.
[01:25:25.090 --> 01:25:27.731]  You were getting into why you think this is all happening, Larry Nichols.
[01:25:29.112 --> 01:25:36.336]  And it is in the news that even mainline megabanks, Royal Bank of Scotland, you name it, says sell everything you got.
[01:25:36.336 --> 01:25:37.577]  Economic implosion coming.
[01:25:37.577 --> 01:25:39.598]  Much of the world's already in a depression.
[01:25:39.598 --> 01:25:46.982]  Americans still aren't aware of it, but some days nothing's coming across the Atlantic or vice versa to the U.S.
[01:25:46.982 --> 01:25:49.804]  Shipping is coming to a halt, slowed down almost entirely from China.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.501]  I mean, this is serious.
[01:25:52.501 --> 01:25:54.483]  What's the real state of the economy?
[01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:59.206]  Talking to your insiders, you said also there was more going on in Scalia than we knew.
[01:25:59.206 --> 01:26:02.008]  It came out as a secret society.
[01:26:02.008 --> 01:26:04.470]  Those two issues, Larry Nichols.
[01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:07.513]  Well, number one, what's going on with the economy?
[01:26:07.513 --> 01:26:12.937]  If you'll notice, the FDIC has put out a warning about the five major banks.
[01:26:12.937 --> 01:26:14.678]  Folks, let me tell you, they use code words.
[01:26:15.999 --> 01:26:21.704]  Alex, there's a code word running around, floating around, called negative interest.
[01:26:21.704 --> 01:26:26.968]  Now guys, I know some of you are thinking, and the public, a lot of the public's thinking negative interest.
[01:26:26.968 --> 01:26:30.211]  Oh boy, that means our house payment will really go down.
[01:26:30.211 --> 01:26:31.332]  No.
[01:26:31.332 --> 01:26:34.955]  Negative interest means, are you listening to me?
[01:26:34.955 --> 01:26:42.101]  Negative interest means they're going to charge you interest to keep your money in the bank.
[01:26:43.001 --> 01:26:44.422]  Then I gotta pay you interest.
[01:26:44.422 --> 01:26:46.303]  Then they're going to nationalize and repatriate.
[01:26:46.303 --> 01:26:48.665]  That's what all this stuff is going on about the banks and the FDIC.
[01:26:48.665 --> 01:26:49.285]  One of our people inside
[01:27:03.001 --> 01:27:16.049]  What the FDIC is talking about, there's a group, a core, that is fighting the repatriation and nationalization of the banks under this financial meltdown.
[01:27:16.049 --> 01:27:21.272]  And they're going to use, of course, we've got to stop the downfall of the country.
[01:27:21.272 --> 01:27:25.254]  Now, what nationalization and repatriation means?
[01:27:25.254 --> 01:27:30.738]  And Alex, I've been in three countries, four, I guess, that collapsed.
[01:27:30.738 --> 01:27:31.498]  Two of them I helped.
[01:27:32.981 --> 01:27:37.903]  In those countries, what nationalization means, the government's going to come in and take over the banks.
[01:27:37.903 --> 01:27:41.605]  And they're going to make the megabanks' foreign debt our debt.
[01:27:41.605 --> 01:27:44.586]  It's not real nationalization, it's globalization.
[01:27:44.586 --> 01:27:53.791]  It's globalization, but now the repatriation part of the nationalization is that means folks are claiming all the money's theirs.
[01:27:53.791 --> 01:27:54.211]  Your money.
[01:27:55.109 --> 01:27:56.590]  Your money belongs to them.
[01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:58.751]  They're going to take your money.
[01:27:58.751 --> 01:28:10.476]  If you don't get your money out of the bank now, excuse my dog, but if you don't get your money out of your bank now, there's going to be a day very, very soon that you're going to go down there and get it.
[01:28:10.476 --> 01:28:13.118]  And they're going to say, what money are you talking about?
[01:28:13.118 --> 01:28:14.358]  What money?
[01:28:14.358 --> 01:28:19.721]  And you may think that you've got this bank that's local and it's not connected to this mega conglomerate.
[01:28:19.721 --> 01:28:20.201]  You're wrong.
[01:28:21.485 --> 01:28:25.368]  Your bank, right where you're at, is connected to these big global banks.
[01:28:25.368 --> 01:28:25.928]  That's all.
[01:28:25.928 --> 01:28:26.548]  They've done it.
[01:28:26.548 --> 01:28:28.069]  They've got it globalized.
[01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:30.891]  That's why Trump has to do what I'm saying.
[01:28:30.891 --> 01:28:34.333]  We've got to fight or this country's done.
[01:28:34.333 --> 01:28:38.176]  And if you don't believe me, look at what they're doing, Alex.
[01:28:38.176 --> 01:28:41.518]  They don't care that you know they're rigging the election.
[01:28:41.518 --> 01:28:50.804]  They don't care that the American people are figuring out, wait a minute, I thought I went to vote for a candidate for president.
[01:28:51.425 --> 01:28:57.670]  And now I find out what Nichols and Alex Jones and all these people have been saying for years, my vote don't mean nothing.
[01:28:57.670 --> 01:28:59.692]  They're going to pick who they want.
[01:28:59.692 --> 01:29:01.474]  There's a reason they're doing it.
[01:29:01.474 --> 01:29:08.099]  It's because they know in the next few weeks, if we have that long, this thing's coming down.
[01:29:08.099 --> 01:29:18.028]  You're going out on a limb here, and you're a credible guy and I respect you, but you're saying in the next few weeks, this is inevitable in the next few years, you're saying the hammer fall is coming.
[01:29:18.823 --> 01:29:22.371]  It ain't gonna take years, and we're lucky.
[01:29:22.371 --> 01:29:24.676]  It might take months, but it had it.
[01:29:24.676 --> 01:29:26.279]  Look, Obama's sitting there.
[01:29:26.279 --> 01:29:27.342]  He's making his plans.
[01:29:27.342 --> 01:29:29.587]  You got Obama with his Islamic
[01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:33.047]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.234 --> 01:30:06.121]  A Connecticut judge has placed herself above the Constitution and above an explicit congressional law.
[01:30:06.121 --> 01:30:14.050]  Judge Barbara Bellis has ruled that Sandy Hook families can sue gun manufacturers Remington, Bushmaster, and others.
[01:30:14.050 --> 01:30:18.876]  But Congress has already explicitly protected firearm manufacturers from liability.
[01:30:19.116 --> 01:30:34.601]  In the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which says they will not be held liable for, quote, the harm caused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse firearm products or ammunition products that function as designed and intended.
[01:30:34.601 --> 01:30:48.725]  The act goes on to explain to people with an anti-gun agenda like Judge Bellis that, quote, the possibility of imposing liability on an entire industry for harm that is solely caused by others is an abuse of the legal system, unquote.
[01:30:48.905 --> 01:30:49.645]  What's next?
[01:30:49.645 --> 01:30:53.646]  Holding Ford liable for a drunk driver killing someone with the car that they made?
[01:30:53.646 --> 01:30:57.507]  If Hillary Clinton has her way, that's what they will do to gun manufacturers.
[01:30:57.507 --> 01:30:59.908]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:30:59.908 --> 01:31:03.429]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:03.429 --> 01:31:08.490]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:31:08.570 --> 01:31:08.991]  We're good.
[01:31:29.807 --> 01:31:30.727]  Shower Filters.
[01:31:30.727 --> 01:31:32.448]  We're introducing the best yet.
[01:31:32.448 --> 01:31:36.510]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.
[01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:41.332]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[01:31:41.332 --> 01:31:48.415]  This new 4-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.

[01:32:08.026 --> 01:32:09.247]  A 360 win.

[01:32:23.738 --> 01:32:28.803]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:32:28.803 --> 01:32:34.908]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.

[01:32:42.715 --> 01:32:49.921]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:32:49.921 --> 01:32:50.722]  10% off on AutoShip.

[01:32:53.304 --> 01:32:55.285]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:32:55.285 --> 01:32:59.148]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:33:09.305 --> 01:33:14.307]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[01:33:14.307 --> 01:33:18.328]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[01:33:18.328 --> 01:33:20.389]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:33:20.389 --> 01:33:22.590]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:24.591]  John has a long mustache.
[01:33:24.591 --> 01:33:26.651]  John has a long mustache.
[01:33:26.651 --> 01:33:29.492]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[01:33:29.492 --> 01:33:33.614]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[01:33:39.486 --> 01:33:41.387]  But they took a lot of people away.
[01:33:41.387 --> 01:33:43.509]  People that they thought were going to make trouble for them.
[01:33:43.509 --> 01:33:46.731]  People that had guns or things they wanted, they just took them away.
[01:33:46.731 --> 01:33:48.092]  Where?
[01:33:48.092 --> 01:33:50.193]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[01:33:50.193 --> 01:33:58.399]  So far we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize kids belong to whole communities.
[01:33:58.399 --> 01:34:02.302]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[01:34:04.045 --> 01:34:08.748]  And we need the type of camps that you all run.
[01:34:08.748 --> 01:34:09.649]  I mean, really.
[01:34:09.649 --> 01:34:13.011]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[01:34:13.011 --> 01:34:18.114]  Now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[01:34:18.114 --> 01:34:20.076]  I'm a sovereign citizen.
[01:34:20.076 --> 01:34:21.817]  I refuse to recognize you guys.
[01:34:22.097 --> 01:34:23.898]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[01:34:23.898 --> 01:34:25.058]  would you see that happening?
[01:34:25.058 --> 01:34:29.741]  We've got a lot of constitutionless and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[01:34:29.741 --> 01:34:39.525]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[01:34:39.525 --> 01:34:45.528]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[01:34:45.528 --> 01:34:50.090]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community
[01:34:56.857 --> 01:34:59.419]  That's what we're doing here, and let's not kid about it.
[01:34:59.419 --> 01:35:04.482]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[01:35:04.482 --> 01:35:07.664]  Put your gun down, really?
[01:35:07.664 --> 01:35:12.647]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:35:12.647 --> 01:35:14.508]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:35:14.508 --> 01:35:16.449]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[01:35:19.179 --> 01:35:24.182]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[01:35:24.182 --> 01:35:27.484]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[01:35:27.484 --> 01:35:41.813]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:35:41.813 --> 01:35:42.834]  We made that intro
[01:35:44.744 --> 01:35:55.192]  Somewhat tongue-in-cheek, obviously, about a year ago, with Hillary saying fund camps for men, and we've actually got army manuals now that are talking about re-education camps in America for political dissidents.
[01:35:55.192 --> 01:35:56.633]  This is what Obama's actually putting out.
[01:35:56.633 --> 01:36:03.578]  And now we have Bill Nye, the science guy, coming out and going, no, we need to look at arresting climate change deniers.
[01:36:03.578 --> 01:36:05.219]  And then he goes on, because look at Enron.
[01:36:05.219 --> 01:36:07.641]  Well, Enron is what came up with the scam with Al Gore.
[01:36:07.641 --> 01:36:09.142]  I'm going to play that clip and then go to our guest.
[01:36:10.533 --> 01:36:13.894]  But everywhere these anti-Trump people are out there trying to beat people up.
[01:36:13.894 --> 01:36:16.694]  Our own crew in New York caught it three times on tape yesterday.
[01:36:16.694 --> 01:36:17.614]  They're in Denver today.
[01:36:17.614 --> 01:36:29.997]  They're on the fourth hour, on the ground, live, with the demonstrations about to begin at the RNC, where they just didn't have the caucuses and just gave it to Ted Cruz.
[01:36:29.997 --> 01:36:31.877]  And look, I've never been an enemy of Ted Cruz.
[01:36:31.877 --> 01:36:33.978]  I just don't like seeing things like that happen.
[01:36:33.978 --> 01:36:35.878]  And Hillary's taking them from Sanders.
[01:36:35.878 --> 01:36:39.199]  In Louisiana, Trump won, but then
[01:36:41.544 --> 01:36:44.365]  Cruz got more delegates and now is the winner of the state.
[01:36:44.365 --> 01:36:45.626]  And Sarah Palin came out in the U.S.
[01:36:45.626 --> 01:36:50.127]  News & World Report and said, voters should decide GOP nominee.
[01:36:50.127 --> 01:36:50.928]  That's surreal.
[01:36:50.928 --> 01:36:52.328]  Of course they should.
[01:36:52.328 --> 01:36:56.890]  Here's another one from CBS News saying the same thing.
[01:36:56.890 --> 01:36:59.411]  Why the GOP can't take the nomination from Donald Trump.
[01:36:59.411 --> 01:37:01.492]  Regardless, this is an attack on free speech.
[01:37:01.492 --> 01:37:02.392]  That's why I'm covering this.
[01:37:02.392 --> 01:37:03.913]  Let's play Bill Nye the Science Guy.
[01:37:03.913 --> 01:37:06.794]  Mark Moreno is on Earth Day next week.
[01:37:06.794 --> 01:37:08.374]  The fellow that did this interview.
[01:37:08.374 --> 01:37:09.095]  It's just a minute long.
[01:37:10.148 --> 01:37:13.969]  Where he says, yeah, we should look at going after these people.
[01:37:13.969 --> 01:37:18.910]  The Attorney Generals in multiple states are talking about indicting climate change deniers.
[01:37:18.910 --> 01:37:20.751]  I mean, this is the attack on free speech, folks.
[01:37:20.751 --> 01:37:24.472]  One step from the Red Dawn scenario, isn't it?
[01:37:24.472 --> 01:37:26.452]  With Hillary up there on the jumbo screen.
[01:37:26.452 --> 01:37:31.373]  We're going to the Senate candidate who has a good chance of winning in Louisiana, speaking of stoned elections.
[01:37:31.373 --> 01:37:32.794]  And we're going to be talking to him here in just a second.
[01:37:32.794 --> 01:37:34.074]  But first, here's Bill Nye the Science Guy.
[01:37:34.918 --> 01:37:41.520]  We interviewed Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the environmentalist, here at the People's Climate March in 2014, September.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:50.702]  He said that the climate deniers, his word, and energy CEOs belong at the Hague with three square meals and a cot with all the other war criminals.
[01:37:50.702 --> 01:37:51.462]  What is your thought on that?
[01:37:51.462 --> 01:37:56.583]  Do you think some of the rhetoric on your side, as I'm sure both sides, but some of the rhetoric on your side gets too carried away?
[01:37:56.583 --> 01:38:00.424]  I mean, what's your thought on jailing skeptics as war criminals?
[01:38:00.424 --> 01:38:01.924]  We'll see what happens.
[01:38:01.924 --> 01:38:04.365]  Was it appropriate to jail the guys from Enron?
[01:38:05.916 --> 01:38:06.476]  Interesting.
[01:38:06.476 --> 01:38:09.258]  Okay, right, so we'll see what happens.
[01:38:09.258 --> 01:38:17.243]  Was it appropriate to jail people from the cigarette industry who insisted that this addictive product was not addictive and so on?
[01:38:17.243 --> 01:38:17.844]  And you think about
[01:38:18.797 --> 01:38:33.020]  In these cases, for me as a taxpayer and voter, the introduction of this extreme doubt, we go with extreme doubt, about climate change is affecting my quality of life as a public citizen.
[01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:44.122]  So I can see where people are very concerned about this and are pursuing criminal investigations as well as engaging in discussions like this.
[01:38:45.549 --> 01:38:49.972]  Enron, just type in Enron Carbon Tax, Enron Global Warming.
[01:38:49.972 --> 01:38:54.435]  I mean, they're the ones that wrote the treaties, everything with Al Gore and others.
[01:38:54.435 --> 01:38:55.476]  They were going to make the money.
[01:38:55.476 --> 01:38:57.317]  They got in trouble for fake energy trading.
[01:38:59.332 --> 01:38:59.993]  That's a scam.
[01:38:59.993 --> 01:39:03.356]  The cigarette people knew it was causing cancer and paid for fake science and admitted it.
[01:39:03.356 --> 01:39:05.018]  That's called fraud.
[01:39:05.018 --> 01:39:08.042]  It's not fraud to say, hey, the sun drives climate.
[01:39:08.042 --> 01:39:17.232]  And then they get the emails from these people, remember, at the major university, coordinating over a thousand universities to, quote, hide the decline in global temperature records.
[01:39:17.232 --> 01:39:18.133]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:39:19.235 --> 01:39:25.578]  All right, going to our guest for the balance of the hour, Colonel Rob Manish, has an amazing background.
[01:39:25.578 --> 01:39:29.460]  Traveled in the Air Force four years ago for serving his country, 32 years including in combat.
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:40.206]  He commanded a B-1 bomber squadron, well those are neat planes, in Iraq and Afghanistan's wars, commanded the sixth largest Air Force base in the world, and served as an advisor to the Joint Chiefs of Staff following the 9-11 attacks.
[01:39:40.206 --> 01:39:45.168]  He helped author the plan for international war on terror, Colonel Manish.
[01:39:47.031 --> 01:39:56.196]  Well, just so much of the stuff he's done, it'll take too long to go over it, but Colonel Manis is also responsible for authoring three pages in the nuclear black book, The Travels Ever with the President.
[01:39:56.196 --> 01:40:01.198]  His military awards and combat decorations include the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, and the Air Medal.
[01:40:01.198 --> 01:40:12.504]  And it goes on, Rob completed his undergraduate work while attending night school at the University of Tampa and holds three master's degrees from Harvard University's Kennedy School and the Air Command and Staff College and the U.S.
[01:40:12.504 --> 01:40:16.446]  College of Naval Warfare, robmanis.com, but it's spelled
[01:40:16.906 --> 01:40:17.286]  Maness.
[01:40:17.286 --> 01:40:20.369]  So it's robmaness.com.
[01:40:20.369 --> 01:40:23.993]  Robmaness.com.
[01:40:23.993 --> 01:40:26.355]  Colonel Rob Maness joins us now via Skype.
[01:40:26.355 --> 01:40:27.976]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:40:27.976 --> 01:40:29.317]  Oh, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:40:29.317 --> 01:40:31.419]  And my mother, thank you for reading that bio.
[01:40:31.419 --> 01:40:32.781]  We really appreciate it.
[01:40:32.781 --> 01:40:33.822]  Well, it's a great bio.
[01:40:33.822 --> 01:40:35.783]  Man, those are neat planes.
[01:40:35.783 --> 01:40:38.366]  They still haven't retired those yet, have they, with the whole swept wings and everything?
[01:40:39.102 --> 01:40:40.402]  No, they haven't retired them.
[01:40:40.402 --> 01:40:54.065]  As a matter of fact, we just brought them home and replaced them with B-52s in the air attacks on the Islamic State over in the Middle East, so the B-1s could get some much-needed upgrades.
[01:40:54.065 --> 01:41:01.646]  They've been carrying the workload for the airstrikes against ISIS since the beginning of the bombing operations against them.
[01:41:01.646 --> 01:41:04.186]  I ought to interview you sometime just about those.
[01:41:04.186 --> 01:41:06.167]  I mean, I've seen them fly over in Austin on Fourth of July.
[01:41:06.167 --> 01:41:08.027]  It looks like a spaceship, even though it was made in the 80s.
[01:41:09.031 --> 01:41:09.832]  Oh yeah.
[01:41:09.832 --> 01:41:11.573]  Yeah, it's very fast.
[01:41:11.573 --> 01:41:17.116]  There's nothing like going supersonic speeds in an aircraft that's the same weight class as a DC-10.
[01:41:17.116 --> 01:41:18.777]  And those fly super low.
[01:41:18.777 --> 01:41:20.598]  I mean, you can fly really low with those, right?
[01:41:20.598 --> 01:41:21.679]  Absolutely.
[01:41:21.679 --> 01:41:29.324]  The automatic terrain following system can take you down to 250 feet at approaching supersonic speeds.
[01:41:29.324 --> 01:41:31.926]  Do they all have the escape pods and stuff?
[01:41:31.926 --> 01:41:36.189]  No, their aircrews are in ejection seats in the B-1 bomber.
[01:41:36.189 --> 01:41:38.250]  Didn't they previously have like an escape pod or something?
[01:41:38.877 --> 01:41:42.280]  The original design did have an escape pod in it, yes it did.
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:45.062]  I'm sorry, let's get into the campaign and why we need you in the U.S.
[01:41:45.062 --> 01:41:46.604]  Senate.
[01:41:46.604 --> 01:41:51.948]  Well, you kind of hit on it in the intro in the videos, especially with this Nye fellow.
[01:41:51.948 --> 01:42:01.937]  Look, Alex, I'm just a normal red-blooded American that cares about his country and is just tired of seeing the Republic torn down.
[01:42:01.957 --> 01:42:02.337]  We're good to go.
[01:42:25.786 --> 01:42:43.493]  Construct for us that gives everybody the ability to hold themselves and their children accountable, to be fiscally responsible, and ensures equality of opportunity for all of us regardless of how we were born or where we came from.
[01:42:43.493 --> 01:42:48.455]  And Mr. Clark, unfortunately, seems to think that we owe allegiance to the government of the United States.
[01:42:48.835 --> 01:42:49.976]  Well that's just not true.
[01:42:49.976 --> 01:43:09.394]  We owe it to the Constitution of the United States and the government that's currently in place in the United States of America has completely outgrown the Constitution of the United States and I'm running for the United States Senate because I believe in those four things that I just told you and we've got to get our country back into a constitutional form of government.
[01:43:09.514 --> 01:43:12.215]  Tell us about the policies, what you would do if you get in the U.S.
[01:43:12.215 --> 01:43:15.557]  Senate, and obviously I'm sporting you over the people you're running against.
[01:43:15.557 --> 01:43:17.618]  I mean, how do we help get you in there?
[01:43:17.618 --> 01:43:19.859]  Because I know that we've got a good shot at it.
[01:43:19.859 --> 01:43:28.243]  Well, first of all, as foreign policy, you know, look, at 32 years in the Air Force, I graduated from the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government.
[01:43:28.243 --> 01:43:32.525]  I studied international security and foreign policy there, along with domestic politics.
[01:43:32.525 --> 01:43:33.825]  I'm a graduate of the U.S.
[01:43:33.825 --> 01:43:37.027]  Navy War College in National Strategy, and
[01:43:38.015 --> 01:43:39.837]  I believe in the Constitution.
[01:43:39.837 --> 01:43:41.079]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[01:43:41.079 --> 01:43:45.924]  I believe in pro-America foreign policy, not pro-UN foreign policy.
[01:43:45.924 --> 01:43:47.406]  That's just absolutely crazy.
[01:43:47.406 --> 01:43:53.593]  We've got to protect America's citizens and vital national interests before we do anything else.
[01:43:53.593 --> 01:43:57.318]  We've got to do things like insist that Congress
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:10.810]  Executes its appropriate role in foreign policy and declaring war and those kind of things and I don't believe in going into every little dictatorship and toppling those guys and creating chaos around the world.
[01:44:10.810 --> 01:44:19.578]  We've done that way too much and we don't want to sacrifice our children's lives unnecessarily the ones that volunteer to defend this country.
[01:44:19.878 --> 01:44:22.479]  And I have three sons in the United States military.
[01:44:22.479 --> 01:44:35.603]  My youngest one that's in is an airman and he's on his way back today to the United Kingdom where we just rolled up some more terrorists, including the one at the airport just down the road from where he'll be landing tonight or in the morning.
[01:44:35.603 --> 01:44:43.745]  So we've got a lot at stake here in this country with our kids putting their lives on the line for us, just like I did for 32 years and my dad did.
[01:44:44.305 --> 01:44:52.290]  So we've got to make sure that we're not out there toppling dictators and getting involved unnecessarily in these countries and protecting America's interests.
[01:44:52.290 --> 01:44:54.071]  We've got to protect America's interests.
[01:45:04.517 --> 01:45:06.759]  Most 80% are military age men.
[01:45:06.759 --> 01:45:08.340]  They're already doing sleeper attacks.
[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:12.003]  A lot of experts believe they're planning a Jihad Tet Offensive in Europe.
[01:45:12.003 --> 01:45:23.033]  What's going to happen when thousands, conservatively, and that's what most experts agree, at least 10,000, just operate and start killing everybody and blowing stuff up and attacking nuclear plants?
[01:45:23.033 --> 01:45:25.595]  They're already having guards getting killed, disappearing.
[01:45:25.595 --> 01:45:29.578]  What's going to happen to the government when this happens and they brought them in
[01:45:30.399 --> 01:45:33.821]  Are they so dumb that they think they won't get in trouble?
[01:45:33.821 --> 01:45:39.685]  I mean, I'm just wondering, why would the socialists like Merkel and Hollande and Obama want to be doing this?
[01:45:39.685 --> 01:45:43.827]  I mean, why do they ally themselves with radical jihadis?
[01:45:43.827 --> 01:45:45.769]  We know they were backing them before in Syria.
[01:45:45.769 --> 01:45:48.490]  The military said no to it, and the people said no.
[01:45:48.490 --> 01:45:51.312]  So now they've been forced to counter Islamic State.
[01:45:51.312 --> 01:45:54.754]  I mean, what's going on where the Russians start to look more like the good guys?
[01:45:54.754 --> 01:45:57.476]  And I'm not defending what the Russians do, they have a lot of problems.
[01:45:57.476 --> 01:45:59.237]  But that's how bad Obama is in my view.
[01:46:00.201 --> 01:46:18.931]  Well, we've got to remember that his goal is to transform the United States of America, and I truly believe that he believes in his heart of hearts that American foreign policy and the foreign policy of Western Europe is the evil, has contributed and caused all of the evils of the world, which is absolutely not true.
[01:46:18.931 --> 01:46:24.014]  Look, we're weaker than we've ever been, we no longer lead, and the world's on fire.
[01:46:24.014 --> 01:46:27.596]  We need to stay strong, and we need to lead in the world.
[01:46:27.876 --> 01:46:37.658]  But that doesn't mean that we need to go putting our kid and military forces into all these countries and intervening where it's not appropriate because our interests aren't at stake.
[01:46:37.658 --> 01:46:40.678]  We've got to make sure we're defending America's interests first.
[01:46:40.678 --> 01:46:45.939]  Look, you know, your question reminds me of the border situation in our own country.
[01:46:45.939 --> 01:46:50.340]  And you kind of touched on... The Border Patrol admits that they, quote, complete the smuggling process.
[01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:54.681]  Our own reporters, two years ago, Jakari Jackson, Don Salazar, went down to the border
[01:46:55.541 --> 01:47:02.949]  Colonel, and the Border Patrol admitted we're ordered to bring the illegals in and give them vouchers and complete the smuggling process.
[01:47:02.949 --> 01:47:04.591]  I mean, just backing you up.
[01:47:04.591 --> 01:47:10.218]  How do they search me when I fly in from Europe, search my bags, but then illegals just walk in?
[01:47:11.255 --> 01:47:26.694]  My son flew home on leave from the United Kingdom a month ago on the same day that the Brussels attacks occurred and he was on an American Airlines flight and before he even got through security he had to answer 32 specific questions.
[01:47:27.874 --> 01:47:31.595]  Just to board the flight to the United States of America.
[01:47:31.595 --> 01:47:32.876]  So we've got a problem.
[01:47:32.876 --> 01:47:39.857]  And part of the problem is that we have folks that are in office right now leading this country and it doesn't really matter what letters behind their name.
[01:47:39.857 --> 01:47:40.878]  You know that, Alex.
[01:47:40.878 --> 01:47:47.359]  And that's why our presidential candidates on the GOP side are so popular.
[01:47:47.359 --> 01:47:50.380]  The two frontrunners are because they believe in Americanism.
[01:47:51.147 --> 01:47:52.868]  We believe in Americanism.
[01:47:52.868 --> 01:47:54.369]  Our sovereignty.
[01:47:54.369 --> 01:47:56.030]  Our sovereignty.
[01:47:56.030 --> 01:47:57.051]  It's simple.
[01:47:57.051 --> 01:47:59.352]  We must respect our own laws.
[01:47:59.352 --> 01:48:02.494]  That's all we ask for is that other people respect our laws.
[01:48:02.494 --> 01:48:08.037]  And we've got to do two things when it comes to things like internal security and immigration control.
[01:48:08.037 --> 01:48:09.118]  We've got to do two things.
[01:48:09.118 --> 01:48:11.939]  It's all we've got to do to get things on the right track.
[01:48:11.939 --> 01:48:13.560]  And that is secure our border.
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:15.441]  Secure our darn border.
[01:48:15.441 --> 01:48:17.823]  And get ourselves to
[01:48:19.702 --> 01:48:22.465]  To make ourselves enforce our current law.
[01:48:22.465 --> 01:48:24.667]  Our current law is not being enforced.
[01:48:24.667 --> 01:48:40.084]  And if we enforce current law, just on the Mexican side and the Central American side alone, the illegals that are in this country, there's few polling out there that data out there that shows that even it was taken during the Obama administration, that even during his administration,
[01:48:40.664 --> 01:48:50.194]  Upwards of 1.2 million people would go back to their homes in Central, South America, and Mexico a year if we would just enforce our current law.
[01:48:50.194 --> 01:48:53.697]  I mean, my goodness, what's wrong with respecting American law?
[01:48:53.697 --> 01:48:57.141]  It is the law of the land, this thing we call the Constitution of the United States.
[01:48:57.141 --> 01:49:02.086]  What do you think the President is thinking, Colonel, when the border's basically wide open?
[01:49:03.499 --> 01:49:05.582]  And then there will be more terror attacks.
[01:49:05.582 --> 01:49:11.290]  They ordered the FBI, as you know, to say San Bernardino wasn't, but two days later it came out it was.
[01:49:11.290 --> 01:49:14.034]  And the FBI leaked that they were ordered to say it wasn't.
[01:49:14.034 --> 01:49:15.596]  There's got to be a major disconnect there.
[01:49:15.596 --> 01:49:18.560]  I mean, why would the president want to let us be attacked?
[01:49:19.704 --> 01:49:25.849]  There's no disconnect, and I don't believe that it's that he wants to let us be attacked, per se.
[01:49:25.849 --> 01:49:28.611]  It's that he doesn't believe that we're going to be attacked.
[01:49:28.611 --> 01:49:43.662]  In spite of all of the series of attacks under this man's watch, of terrorist attacks from Islamic Jihadist extremists, from Boston to Chattanooga to Fort Hood to San Bernardino, all of those attacks, and the man just still
[01:49:44.494 --> 01:49:49.916]  Looks the camera in the eye and the American people in the eye and says, I don't believe that we're under attack.
[01:49:49.916 --> 01:49:51.276]  These are all lone wolves.
[01:49:51.276 --> 01:49:53.437]  And that's the spin that he's trying to put on it.
[01:49:53.437 --> 01:50:01.459]  And quite frankly, he has the mainstream media on his side and he knows that he can keep the American people asleep in large numbers.
[01:50:01.459 --> 01:50:02.480]  And he was successful.
[01:50:03.540 --> 01:50:09.148]  Colonel, as you know, when it came to the shootings at the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps centers, they would just cover those up.
[01:50:09.148 --> 01:50:12.032]  Or the cops getting shot with the people yelling Allah Akbar.
[01:50:12.032 --> 01:50:14.154]  They say it's not terror-related, you never hear about it again.
[01:50:14.154 --> 01:50:16.397]  Or the nightclub getting attacked in Canada.
[01:50:16.397 --> 01:50:17.299]  It's happening all the time.
[01:50:18.398 --> 01:50:39.814]  It happens all the time, and while the fatality numbers are low, and he likes to use the numbers of more people are killed in such and such a deal, or have been killed in such and such deals, whatever it is, you pick the vehicle that he uses, as opposed to those killed by terrorism since 9-11, but that's not the point.
[01:50:40.439 --> 01:50:43.100]  The point is, this is the United States of America.
[01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:51.043]  Men and women like me have risked their lives and given their lives and their bodies to protect the United States of America and the American people.
[01:50:51.043 --> 01:50:55.485]  And I've served for 32 and a half years doing that, supporting the Constitution.
[01:50:55.485 --> 01:51:03.948]  And now I have to live with the fact that my 11-year-old and my wife don't feel secure in their own homes because of these Islamic Jihadist terrorisms.
[01:51:03.948 --> 01:51:08.350]  Because men like Barack Obama insist on not even calling the enemy
[01:51:08.450 --> 01:51:11.391]  Well, we know things in the military.
[01:51:11.391 --> 01:51:15.313]  We learn how to conduct wars and plan for wars, and you've got to do some simple things.
[01:51:15.313 --> 01:51:16.773]  It's not complicated.
[01:51:16.773 --> 01:51:21.515]  You first have to identify the enemy, and it's Islamic jihadism and extremism.
[01:51:21.515 --> 01:51:22.235]  That's what it is.
[01:51:22.235 --> 01:51:32.339]  Then you have to find the enemy, and we know where most of them are throughout the Middle East and North and Middle Africa now, and a lot of them are in Europe, as you just pointed out, Alex, and we know that.
[01:51:32.919 --> 01:51:33.400]  Absolutely.
[01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:34.120]  I want to know why.
[01:51:53.015 --> 01:52:04.132]  The New York Daily News reports, CBS reports, they have planes all the time at JFK coming in from overseas and they don't even check their passports or IDs because quote, you know, the government tells them let them in.
[01:52:05.461 --> 01:52:10.545]  And so, I'm gonna get searched, the TSA's there, it's all theater, my rights are being violated.
[01:52:10.545 --> 01:52:18.312]  It'd be one thing if they were actually stopping these people and then searching me, but no, they're searching me and my family, but then letting the obvious groups in.
[01:52:18.312 --> 01:52:20.553]  I mean, what's the equation there?
[01:52:20.553 --> 01:52:25.758]  I guess just train the public how to be a slave, then there's more terror attacks and they take more of my rights, Colonel?
[01:52:26.478 --> 01:52:28.200]  It's political correctness.
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:37.852]  Political correctness is going to be the end of this country and the end of freedom for mankind if we don't get our arms wrapped around it.
[01:52:37.852 --> 01:52:42.717]  That's why we have folks doing so well that insist on not using political correctness.
[01:52:42.717 --> 01:52:44.520]  Look, we've got to call the enemy what it is.
[01:52:45.180 --> 01:52:48.242]  Identify what needs to be done and then get the job done.
[01:52:48.242 --> 01:53:03.013]  And we've got to stop doing stupid stuff like in Louisiana here, activists are fighting the real ID for the fifth year in a row so that the federal government doesn't get to have an entire database on all of the citizens of Louisiana except for the criminals.
[01:53:03.493 --> 01:53:05.814]  Because they won't go participate in that.
[01:53:05.814 --> 01:53:07.455]  It's the same thing with gun control.
[01:53:07.455 --> 01:53:09.636]  You know, I'm a huge Second Amendment advocate.
[01:53:09.636 --> 01:53:23.384]  My family, military service goes all the way back to the American Revolution, and the right to keep and bear arms is the foundation and the insurance policy for the freedom of all Americans, and the insurance policy to protect the Constitution of the United States.
[01:53:23.384 --> 01:53:26.505]  And we will do that, just as your intro video showed.
[01:53:26.505 --> 01:53:27.046]  When pushed
[01:53:27.686 --> 01:53:29.028]  We will get that job done.
[01:53:29.028 --> 01:53:30.649]  And you know what?
[01:53:30.649 --> 01:53:38.737]  The President of the United States needs to repeal the order that keeps commanders from arming their men and women on military bases today.
[01:53:38.737 --> 01:53:47.226]  Every man and woman that's in a uniform, on duty, should be armed with at least a sidearm today, whether you're in the United States or overseas.
[01:53:47.706 --> 01:54:01.949]  My son is stationed at a military base in Europe that just had a jihadi convicted of attempting to drive through the fence and grab the first military person that they could see and cut their throat while on video.
[01:54:01.949 --> 01:54:09.371]  And that's the kind of thing that's happening to our American men and women and it's being planned against these soft targets.
[01:54:09.371 --> 01:54:13.352]  And they wouldn't even say Major Hassan for four years was a jihadi, remember that?
[01:54:14.193 --> 01:54:14.893]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:54:14.893 --> 01:54:17.734]  It's the most ridiculous thing that I've ever seen.
[01:54:17.734 --> 01:54:19.155]  I was still in the military then.
[01:54:19.155 --> 01:54:22.076]  I couldn't really speak up and say anything.
[01:54:22.076 --> 01:54:27.198]  But I'm going to tell you now, that was the dumbest move this president has ever made.
[01:54:27.198 --> 01:54:37.681]  And he needs to be leaving office very quietly with his head hanging in shame for what he's done to the survivors and the wounded from the Fort Hood Massacre.
[01:54:37.681 --> 01:54:39.382]  That's an Islamic Jihadist.
[01:54:39.662 --> 01:54:40.923]  Colonel Rob Maness.
[01:54:40.923 --> 01:54:42.223]  We've only got about a minute or two left.
[01:54:42.223 --> 01:54:45.324]  People need to go to robmaness.com and support your campaign.
[01:54:45.324 --> 01:54:46.565]  I know you're doing well.
[01:54:46.565 --> 01:54:47.845]  And I just hope you get into the U.S.
[01:54:47.845 --> 01:54:48.966]  Senate separately.
[01:54:48.966 --> 01:54:55.348]  I know you've got a lot of great ideas on cutting taxes and a lot of other things that folks can find out about there on the site.
[01:54:55.348 --> 01:54:57.129]  You can find out how to volunteer.
[01:54:57.129 --> 01:55:02.571]  You've got a store with some of the apparel and stuff for folks who want to help spread the word.
[01:55:02.571 --> 01:55:05.092]  But I tell you, I just want to restore sovereignty.
[01:55:05.092 --> 01:55:05.973]  I just want to restore
[01:55:06.653 --> 01:55:08.614]  You know, this nation's basic integrity.
[01:55:08.614 --> 01:55:11.536]  We are having an attempt of a leftist takeover in this country.
[01:55:11.536 --> 01:55:12.657]  And I'm a libertarian.
[01:55:12.657 --> 01:55:13.798]  I'm not even a so-called conservative.
[01:55:13.798 --> 01:55:14.778]  I'm just a patriot.
[01:55:14.778 --> 01:55:17.000]  And these people really think it's their time.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:17.900]  They've uncloaked.
[01:55:17.900 --> 01:55:20.982]  They're showing themselves to really be aggressive.
[01:55:20.982 --> 01:55:22.984]  And we need a total landslide against these people.
[01:55:22.984 --> 01:55:26.826]  And we need to establish that Republicans are removed from office as well.
[01:55:26.826 --> 01:55:27.827]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:55:27.827 --> 01:55:29.188]  I appreciate you having me on.
[01:55:29.188 --> 01:55:32.049]  You can find us at Rob Maness on Twitter also.
[01:55:32.049 --> 01:55:34.071]  Thanks for showing the website at robmaness.com.
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:35.600]  And you know what?
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:38.041]  We've got to stop doing these dumb things in our government.
[01:55:38.041 --> 01:55:40.663]  Like the 9-11 report, the 28 pages.
[01:55:40.663 --> 01:55:42.163]  Let's get that public.
[01:55:42.163 --> 01:55:44.104]  We've got to know who the enemy is.
[01:55:44.104 --> 01:55:44.925]  We've got to do that.
[01:55:44.925 --> 01:55:47.946]  We've got to do things like audit the Fed and those kind of things.
[01:55:47.946 --> 01:55:49.006]  Well, that's awesome.
[01:55:49.006 --> 01:55:50.407]  I mean, you've got a lot of great policies.
[01:55:50.407 --> 01:55:51.708]  That's why we're supporting you.
[01:55:51.708 --> 01:55:52.388]  Colonel, God bless.
[01:55:52.388 --> 01:55:53.829]  Look forward to speaking to you when you're in the U.S.
[01:55:53.829 --> 01:55:54.629]  Senate or before then.
[01:55:55.390 --> 01:55:56.231]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:55:56.231 --> 01:55:56.811]  Thanks a lot.
[01:55:56.811 --> 01:55:57.091]  You bet.
[01:55:57.091 --> 01:55:57.692]  What a great guy.
[01:55:57.692 --> 01:55:58.973]  We need people like that in the U.S.
[01:55:58.973 --> 01:56:09.981]  Senate and all these lawyers and all these establishment people, I tell you, who have set up a world government, basically, and they want to just fold us into it now and kind of graduate to that higher level of control.
[01:56:09.981 --> 01:56:11.162]  And it's time that that stopped.
[01:56:11.162 --> 01:56:13.884]  I want nationalists and I want them now.
[01:56:13.884 --> 01:56:19.088]  And I don't want them to bring the jihadis in and let them attack us to turn us into a police state.
[01:56:19.088 --> 01:56:22.050]  I mean, you want to grab my testicles after I even go through the scanner or whatever?
[01:56:22.050 --> 01:56:22.330]  I'm dying.
[01:56:23.786 --> 01:56:25.127]  The border's basically open.
[01:56:25.127 --> 01:56:26.329]  Leave me alone!
[01:56:26.329 --> 01:56:29.351]  And I'm not mad at the TSA themselves.
[01:56:29.351 --> 01:56:30.192]  It's the Congress.
[01:56:30.192 --> 01:56:32.915]  It's the government.
[01:56:32.915 --> 01:56:38.380]  I realize blaming the TSA, we need to blame the law and the feds.
[01:56:38.380 --> 01:56:39.281]  It's a joke.
[01:56:39.281 --> 01:56:40.242]  Okay.
[01:56:40.242 --> 01:56:40.883]  Briefly, folks.
[01:56:42.136 --> 01:56:48.598]  We need your support now more than ever with our crew out there on the street, 24-7 basically, and our reporters, the Bilderberg coming up and everything else.
[01:56:48.598 --> 01:56:50.698]  Buy the Hillary for Prison t-shirts.
[01:56:50.698 --> 01:56:51.859]  Buy them all on Lobby Shirts.
[01:56:51.859 --> 01:56:54.559]  We have them in women's designs with gold lettering.
[01:56:54.559 --> 01:56:55.680]  They're just amazing.
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:56.460]  Looks like real gold.
[01:56:56.460 --> 01:56:57.980]  It's like gold foil.
[01:56:57.980 --> 01:57:01.541]  We have just so many other great products from Fort Worth Radio and non-GMO seeds.
[01:57:01.541 --> 01:57:06.623]  And we have 45% off BrainForce, the ultimate brain-boosting, healthy, nootropic out there.
[01:57:07.743 --> 01:57:10.085]  I mean, comparable stuff's like 60 bucks a bottle.
[01:57:10.085 --> 01:57:12.587]  That's because they mark it up five to six times.
[01:57:12.587 --> 01:57:13.607]  I don't do that.
[01:57:13.607 --> 01:57:15.148]  Maybe I should, then I don't have to plug all the time.
[01:57:15.148 --> 01:57:20.472]  But it's 25% off the already discounted price, 45% off normal retail for a limited time.
[01:57:20.472 --> 01:57:21.953]  Infowars.
[01:57:21.953 --> 01:57:23.915]  Store.com is the umbrella site.
[01:57:23.915 --> 01:57:24.655]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:57:25.936 --> 01:57:27.397]  It's the most amazing, true
[01:57:49.336 --> 01:57:56.222]  Nutraceutical that we have with the best form of bio PQQ, CoQ10 and so many other items.
[01:57:56.222 --> 01:57:59.625]  DNA Force is back and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[01:57:59.625 --> 01:58:02.347]  What a bottle of DNA Force will do for you is simply amazing.
[01:58:02.347 --> 01:58:07.992]  175 studies linked to that particular product because it's so amazing and so documented.
[01:58:07.992 --> 01:58:11.695]  Several of the compounds in it are prescription in Europe, Japan and other areas.
[01:58:12.515 --> 01:58:16.957]  We basically get this from the Japanese pharmaceutical industry, the division of Mitsubishi America.
[01:58:16.957 --> 01:58:18.237]  Just one of the ingredients.
[01:58:18.237 --> 01:58:19.858]  That's how good it is.
[01:58:19.858 --> 01:58:22.159]  Not synthetic, but biological.
[01:58:22.159 --> 01:58:24.560]  DNA Force is amazing.
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:25.440]  Check it out.
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:27.621]  The nerve growth factor.
[01:58:27.621 --> 01:58:29.782]  What it does to your mitochondria.
[01:58:29.782 --> 01:58:30.322]  Look it up.
[01:58:30.322 --> 01:58:31.203]  I'm on it.
[01:58:31.203 --> 01:58:32.523]  And I'm not a beach boy or anything.
[01:58:32.523 --> 01:58:33.784]  I look better than I did, don't I?
[01:58:33.784 --> 01:58:34.964]  Infowarslives.com.
[01:58:34.964 --> 01:58:36.245]  Your purchase makes it all possible.
[01:58:36.505 --> 01:58:38.167]  I want to salute you and thank you for your support.
[01:58:38.167 --> 01:58:41.229]  We'll be back in the third hour, jam-packed with other guests and tons of news.
[01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:43.992]  This is Breaking Benghazi News.
[01:58:43.992 --> 01:58:45.933]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.180 --> 01:58:56.663]  Uh, yeah, Alex, first of all, I want to say Bigfoot 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[01:58:56.663 --> 01:58:57.623]  I use them all.
[01:58:57.623 --> 01:58:58.603]  They're phenomenal.
[01:58:58.603 --> 01:58:59.003]  They work.
[01:58:59.003 --> 01:58:59.584]  Buy them, folks.
[01:58:59.584 --> 01:59:00.384]  Thank you, brother.
[01:59:00.384 --> 01:59:02.605]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:59:02.605 --> 01:59:08.807]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[01:59:08.807 --> 01:59:10.808]  Welcome to the Info War.
[01:59:10.808 --> 01:59:16.210]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Info War at the same time.
[01:59:16.670 --> 01:59:17.371]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[01:59:17.371 --> 01:59:21.295]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, QFX, nascent iodine.
[01:59:21.295 --> 01:59:22.056]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:59:22.056 --> 01:59:23.097]  Have they worked for you?
[01:59:23.097 --> 01:59:25.960]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:27.061]  What products are you taking?
[01:59:27.061 --> 01:59:35.329]  Everything from Super Male to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA Force.
[01:59:35.329 --> 01:59:38.793]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[01:59:38.953 --> 01:59:43.998]  Visit Infowarslives.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[01:59:43.998 --> 01:59:46.160]  That's Infowarslives.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:48.222]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:07.458 --> 02:00:11.519]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:11.519 --> 02:00:16.381]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.381 --> 02:00:17.321]  Bring in the hag.
[02:00:17.321 --> 02:00:24.024]  Now, go on to the legend.
[02:00:24.024 --> 02:00:26.704]  As we all will.
[02:00:26.704 --> 02:00:29.545]  Join our ancestors.
[02:00:29.545 --> 02:00:32.827]  I don't want to join my ancestors.
[02:00:32.827 --> 02:00:35.287]  I don't want to die.
[02:00:35.287 --> 02:00:36.968]  I tell you, I'm comfortable with it.
[02:00:40.945 --> 02:00:45.087]  He only did what he had to do.
[02:00:45.087 --> 02:00:47.709]  And now he's grown old.
[02:00:47.709 --> 02:00:49.690]  And now he's grown old.
[02:00:49.690 --> 02:00:54.312]  I know what goes forward though, it's the human species.
[02:00:54.312 --> 02:01:02.077]  There's really no restraint now on the genetic engineers, on the elite, the weapons they're building.
[02:01:02.077 --> 02:01:04.478]  There's only a lust for raw power.
[02:01:10.738 --> 02:01:21.252]  I hope we can survive our collective madness.
[02:01:21.252 --> 02:01:24.637]  I hope that we can survive the mad scientists.
[02:01:28.605 --> 02:01:32.929]  Hell, asteroids and super quakes and things like that are a big enough issue to deal with.
[02:01:32.929 --> 02:01:35.551]  I'm going to talk about that some later.
[02:01:35.551 --> 02:01:37.493]  California is just due for mega quakes.
[02:01:37.493 --> 02:01:39.015]  It's like two years overdue.
[02:01:39.015 --> 02:01:44.940]  The entire rest of the Pacific Rim has had a big quake in the last decade.
[02:01:44.940 --> 02:01:48.063]  And when it hits, they think it's going to be super devastating.
[02:01:48.063 --> 02:01:49.184]  I'm not trying to be negative here.
[02:01:49.184 --> 02:01:51.546]  I'm just talking about how we just don't expect things until they hit us.
[02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:55.873]  We have a 7.4 earthquake hit southern Japan.
[02:01:55.873 --> 02:01:59.276]  We've got volcanoes going crazy all over the place.
[02:01:59.276 --> 02:02:03.580]  The inner areas of the earth are definitely active.
[02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:05.642]  And imagine if they came out and said,
[02:02:06.678 --> 02:02:23.391]  If you don't believe that man is causing the earthquakes, or man's causing the molten lava to be more active, we're going to put you in jail, like Bill Nye says we should do, we should look at doing, if you don't believe in man-made global warming, or now climate change, or whatever else they tell you the science is fixed on, when it's not.
[02:02:23.391 --> 02:02:30.956]  I mean, most scientists, astrophysicists, and solar experts, and others, they're just like, no, it's the sun.
[02:02:30.956 --> 02:02:35.200]  But the UN had a vote five years ago, and they said the sun has no effect on climate.
[02:02:36.049 --> 02:02:41.854]  They're saying your water heater has no effect on the hot water that you have in your bathtub.
[02:02:41.854 --> 02:02:46.399]  I mean, it's the reason the water's hot.
[02:02:46.399 --> 02:02:48.761]  It's ridiculous.
[02:02:48.761 --> 02:02:49.241]  And they knew.
[02:02:49.241 --> 02:02:52.564]  The sun started cooling down, the earth started getting cooler.
[02:02:52.564 --> 02:02:58.650]  The sun is in a more dormant phase.
[02:02:58.650 --> 02:02:59.391]  And they know that.
[02:03:00.725 --> 02:03:02.605]  And he goes, but Enron ran scams.
[02:03:02.605 --> 02:03:03.846]  They went to jail.
[02:03:03.846 --> 02:03:07.526]  Enron lied to people about how much the power was costing.
[02:03:07.526 --> 02:03:10.307]  And then Enron was the one that came up with the carbon tax.
[02:03:10.307 --> 02:03:14.828]  I just cannot believe the rich irony.
[02:03:14.828 --> 02:03:17.588]  The rich hypocrisy.
[02:03:17.588 --> 02:03:18.589]  It's not even hypocrisy.
[02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:20.229]  What is the word?
[02:03:20.229 --> 02:03:23.850]  Does Bill Nye not know that Enron came up with the whole scam?
[02:03:23.850 --> 02:03:27.871]  Or that the whole thing's about that?
[02:03:27.871 --> 02:03:29.891]  They've invested so much, they will not stop.
[02:03:32.498 --> 02:03:33.379]  I never finished this clip.
[02:03:33.379 --> 02:03:34.261]  I want to finish it now.
[02:03:34.261 --> 02:03:39.107]  This is Barbara Boxer attacking first a philosopher.
[02:03:39.107 --> 02:03:40.369]  She says, I don't listen to philosophers.
[02:03:40.369 --> 02:03:44.634]  Then she goes and attacks a Catholic priest because he doesn't agree with the Pope, who isn't a scientist either.
[02:03:44.634 --> 02:03:48.159]  But we can all look at the evidence and know that a carbon tax is a death sentence.
[02:03:48.159 --> 02:03:48.860]  That's what they're saying.
[02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:49.180]  Here it is.
[02:03:50.077 --> 02:03:52.160]  This is one of the greatest moral crimes.
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:04:00.750]  If you make energy more expensive or you prohibit or restrict people from getting energy from sources like coal, that's literally death.
[02:04:00.750 --> 02:04:02.413]  Mr. Epstein, are you a scientist?
[02:04:03.533 --> 02:04:04.134]  No.
[02:04:04.134 --> 02:04:04.994]  Philosopher.
[02:04:04.994 --> 02:04:06.135]  You're a philosopher?
[02:04:06.135 --> 02:04:06.856]  Yes.
[02:04:06.856 --> 02:04:07.657]  Okay.
[02:04:07.657 --> 02:04:11.360]  Well, this is the Environment and Public Works Committee.
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:14.703]  I think it's interesting we have a philosopher here talking about an issue.
[02:04:14.703 --> 02:04:16.384]  It's to teach you how to think more clearly.
[02:04:16.384 --> 02:04:19.347]  Well, you don't have to teach me how to think more clearly.
[02:04:19.347 --> 02:04:20.048]  You don't have to.
[02:04:20.048 --> 02:04:23.270]  Try running for the Senate on your platform.
[02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:29.056]  Reverend Nelson, perhaps the most... Well, this is the place to have a philosopher, not a scientist.
[02:04:29.056 --> 02:04:30.036]  It's perfect for this...
[02:04:30.877 --> 02:04:31.537]  Republican.
[02:04:31.537 --> 02:04:33.198]  You have to integrate the big picture data.
[02:04:33.198 --> 02:04:34.939]  I'm not asking you anything.
[02:04:34.939 --> 02:04:44.985]  I'm telling you that all you have to know is you're a philosopher, not a scientist, and I don't appreciate getting lectured by a philosopher about science.
[02:04:44.985 --> 02:04:47.786]  Now, I want to talk to... I can ask you what I want.
[02:04:47.786 --> 02:04:50.448]  Do you disagree with the Pope on climate change?
[02:04:50.448 --> 02:04:51.849]  It's a simple yes or no.
[02:04:51.849 --> 02:04:58.853]  When the Pope says things that have to do with science, he does not speak from the Magistrate's office.
[02:05:00.194 --> 02:05:08.436]  A seismologist warns that catastrophic mega-earthquakes are on their way after five major earthquakes took place in the last 48 hours.
[02:05:08.436 --> 02:05:19.918]  Seismologist Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado has made headlines all over the world by warning that current conditions might trigger at least four earthquakes greater than 8.0 in magnitude.
[02:05:19.918 --> 02:05:26.740]  If his projections are accurate, our planet could be on the precipice of a wave of natural disasters unlike anything that any of us have witnessed before.
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:32.886]  A single magnitude 8.0 earthquake in a populated area would be a disaster of historic proportions.
[02:05:32.886 --> 02:05:33.888]  But four of them?
[02:05:33.888 --> 02:05:36.030]  That would be a complete and utter nightmare.
[02:05:36.030 --> 02:05:41.456]  And according to Volcano Discovery, 38 volcanoes around the globe are erupting right now.
[02:05:41.456 --> 02:05:42.437]  Michael Snyder asks,
[02:05:42.657 --> 02:05:43.819]  Why is this happening?
[02:05:43.819 --> 02:05:47.704]  Why is the crust of the earth shaking so violently all of a sudden?
[02:05:47.704 --> 02:05:53.312]  In Matthew 24, Jesus warned us that there would be earthquakes in diverse places just prior to his return.
[02:05:53.312 --> 02:05:57.157]  Are we truly in the times the Bible refers to as the last days?

[02:05:59.961 --> 02:06:06.464]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[02:06:06.464 --> 02:06:19.449]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[02:06:19.449 --> 02:06:23.110]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:06:23.110 --> 02:06:26.652]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today,
[02:06:26.932 --> 02:06:30.075]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:06:30.075 --> 02:06:42.946]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:06:42.946 --> 02:06:44.487]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:06:44.787 --> 02:06:51.178]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[02:07:03.818 --> 02:07:04.758]  That's right, Anthony.

[02:07:21.683 --> 02:07:27.505]  There are a lot of brain boosters out there, or what's known as nootropics, but here's what separates BrainForce from the rest.
[02:07:27.805 --> 02:07:39.595]  Unlike some energy drinks and supplements, Brain Force uses natural brain activation ingredients like Yerba Mate Extract, Alpha-GPC, L-Theanine, Hyperzine A, Phosphatidylserine, B12, and many others.
[02:07:39.595 --> 02:07:44.999]  Major nutraceutical review sites rave about this formulation, and they also rave about the price.

[02:08:10.407 --> 02:08:13.048]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:13.048 --> 02:08:14.809]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.843 --> 02:08:31.766]  He was on the air, I don't know, three weeks ago with Mr. Dent, Peter Schiff, and I wanted to have a nice discussion.
[02:08:31.766 --> 02:08:36.268]  It got a little bit heated, especially on Dent's side.
[02:08:36.268 --> 02:08:45.492]  I didn't know that guy could get excited, but it was definitely very thought-provoking because I wanted to get Peter Schiff on with him because I think both guys are really smart and I wanted to see where they think things are going.
[02:08:46.945 --> 02:08:54.130]  Boy, Peter has been saying that he thinks the IMF would basically and World Bank would call for a further race of negative interest rates.
[02:08:54.130 --> 02:08:56.932]  For folks that don't know what that means, we're going to break it down.
[02:08:56.932 --> 02:08:59.794]  We don't get lower interest rates.
[02:08:59.794 --> 02:09:00.695]  No, no, no.
[02:09:00.695 --> 02:09:03.276]  It means the banks start charging us basically to keep money.
[02:09:03.276 --> 02:09:05.118]  That's already started in a few areas of Europe.
[02:09:05.118 --> 02:09:12.543]  And if you want to know where we're going, look at Europe because the bail-ins, just all the craziness, and they are gearing up here
[02:09:13.704 --> 02:09:15.345]  They're admitting the economy's in trouble.
[02:09:15.345 --> 02:09:17.367]  The Federal Reserve admits it's in trouble.
[02:09:17.367 --> 02:09:21.932]  When Schiff predicted they would just, you know, go up a small amount, he said then they might even go back up to that.
[02:09:21.932 --> 02:09:23.013]  They're not talking about it!
[02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:26.251]  So we're going to find out what he thinks is going on.
[02:09:26.251 --> 02:09:28.752]  He's one of the best people to talk to, because you're never sure.
[02:09:28.752 --> 02:09:30.773]  The establishment isn't kind of sure.
[02:09:30.773 --> 02:09:32.955]  They're kind of waiting to the last minute as well.
[02:09:32.955 --> 02:09:36.357]  We've seen the main New York Fed say they're out of bullets.
[02:09:36.357 --> 02:09:37.697]  A term shift used a couple years ago.
[02:09:37.697 --> 02:09:39.719]  They just don't have anything to do.
[02:09:39.719 --> 02:09:41.560]  So many people go, well, I'm not in the stock market.
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:42.761]  I don't care.
[02:09:42.761 --> 02:09:45.002]  Everything's connected to this, folks.
[02:09:45.002 --> 02:09:46.483]  So we're on top of this giant bubble.
[02:09:47.566 --> 02:09:52.630]  And they're saying Trump is gloom and doom because he goes, we're in trouble, we're in a big bubble.
[02:09:52.630 --> 02:09:54.312]  And they go, oh, look at Trump, that firmonger.
[02:09:54.312 --> 02:09:56.353]  I mean, we're on the biggest bubble ever.
[02:09:56.353 --> 02:10:01.818]  So Europac.com, Billions Under Management, I'm not going to go into Peter Schiff's whole background.
[02:10:01.818 --> 02:10:06.661]  Most folks know who he is, best-selling researcher and author and radio host in his own right.
[02:10:06.661 --> 02:10:11.645]  Europac.com, I'm Alex Jones, of course, with Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:10:12.406 --> 02:10:16.071]  He'll be gone at the bottom of the hour, and then I'm going to spend 30 minutes on news.
[02:10:16.071 --> 02:10:17.173]  There's a bunch of it.
[02:10:17.173 --> 02:10:22.240]  Military news, Russians buzzing ships, our stories on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:22.961]  There's just a lot of it.
[02:10:22.961 --> 02:10:23.521]  I'm going to get to it.
[02:10:23.521 --> 02:10:29.129]  In the fourth hour, our crew are in Denver, where people are protesting the RNC just canceling the election there.
[02:10:29.730 --> 02:10:39.254]  They tried to act like this was normal, like a con game, and now everybody's waking up to it, and even a lot of mainline Republicans are saying it's wrong, so we're gonna get into that as well.
[02:10:39.254 --> 02:10:43.235]  Peter Schiff has a two-second delay, so I'm gonna try to not jump in too much.
[02:10:43.235 --> 02:10:47.277]  The Skype's acting weird today, so we're gonna go to Peter Schiff right now.
[02:10:47.277 --> 02:10:52.739]  Again, if you're a radio listener, InfoWars.com forward slash show, you can always add another dimension.
[02:10:52.739 --> 02:10:55.960]  Most of you listen at lunch, you're in your car, I get that, but when you're at home,
[02:10:56.460 --> 02:10:58.561]  I want to add another level to it.
[02:10:58.561 --> 02:11:00.561]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:11:00.561 --> 02:11:05.522]  We're also going out on TV satellites, have some TV and cable systems like in Houston picking us up.
[02:11:05.522 --> 02:11:09.343]  We're about to roll that a lot bigger in the next few months and start listing a bunch of affiliates.
[02:11:09.343 --> 02:11:11.024]  Really exciting things on that front as well.
[02:11:11.024 --> 02:11:15.305]  But again, going to Peter Schiff of Europack.com.
[02:11:15.305 --> 02:11:17.506]  Peter, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:11:17.506 --> 02:11:18.806]  Oh, thanks for having me back on, Alex.
[02:11:20.123 --> 02:11:20.966]  Where do we start?
[02:11:20.966 --> 02:11:24.077]  I mean, are we 30 seconds from midnight?
[02:11:24.077 --> 02:11:25.140]  I mean, how bad is it?
[02:11:25.140 --> 02:11:26.445]  What's really going on in the economy?
[02:11:27.694 --> 02:11:34.799]  Well, it's no way to know exactly, you know, the timetable, but obviously this economy is already back in recession.
[02:11:34.799 --> 02:11:38.661]  And if it's not in a recession, it's certainly on the cusp of one.
[02:11:38.661 --> 02:11:40.463]  But, you know, you look at the data that came out.
[02:11:40.463 --> 02:11:45.226]  We got industrial production numbers that came out earlier this morning.
[02:11:45.226 --> 02:11:46.447]  They were looking for a bounce.
[02:11:46.447 --> 02:11:48.348]  Instead, we got another decline.
[02:11:48.348 --> 02:11:51.370]  They revised the February number down.
[02:11:51.370 --> 02:11:54.632]  We got big inventories build again this week.
[02:11:54.632 --> 02:11:56.773]  Retail sales disappointed.
[02:11:56.773 --> 02:11:57.634]  I think it's clear that
[02:11:58.214 --> 02:12:09.241]  We could be in a negative GDP quarter right now, and I think that if the first quarter is bad, this second quarter is going to be worse.
[02:12:09.241 --> 02:12:14.565]  Because the last couple of years, we had a rebound in the second quarter because we had very cold winters.
[02:12:14.565 --> 02:12:19.888]  Well, this winter was the warmest in 120 years, so there is nothing to rebound from.
[02:12:19.888 --> 02:12:24.071]  If anything, some of the activity might have been pulled into the first quarter from the second.
[02:12:24.511 --> 02:12:30.793]  Meanwhile, you've got this huge inventory glut that needs to be wound down, and the trade deficit is getting worse.
[02:12:30.793 --> 02:12:32.594]  So there's a lot bearing down on U.S.
[02:12:32.594 --> 02:12:33.694]  economic growth.
[02:12:33.694 --> 02:12:41.537]  The problem for the Fed is how do they launch a new round of stimulus and still pretend the economy's in good shape?
[02:12:41.537 --> 02:12:50.621]  Because that's the message President Obama is trying to sell, and that's the message that Hillary Clinton is trying to run on, and Janet Yellen doesn't want to take the wind out of their sails.
[02:12:53.513 --> 02:12:54.694]  What does it signify?
[02:12:54.694 --> 02:12:56.555]  Was my analysis accurate?
[02:12:56.555 --> 02:13:00.838]  Or what can you add of what negative interest rates will do?
[02:13:00.838 --> 02:13:03.060]  And then what do you predict they're going to do?
[02:13:03.060 --> 02:13:05.562]  Well, I mean, negative interest rates are a disaster.
[02:13:05.562 --> 02:13:07.323]  I mean, it's not working in Japan.
[02:13:07.323 --> 02:13:08.804]  It's not working in Europe.
[02:13:08.804 --> 02:13:10.525]  It's not going to work here.
[02:13:10.525 --> 02:13:15.829]  But just because it doesn't work doesn't mean we're not going to do it, because everything we do doesn't work and we do it anyway.
[02:13:15.829 --> 02:13:21.493]  But I think it shows desperation that you've had all these central bankers lowering interest rates and lowering interest
[02:13:21.513 --> 02:13:21.593]  Sure.
[02:13:42.134 --> 02:13:44.837]  ...really starts to turn around in Europe and Japan.
[02:13:44.837 --> 02:13:53.326]  The central banks there are going to be forced to abandon 0% rates and they're actually going to have to raise rates pretty high to get out in front of that inflation curve.
[02:13:53.326 --> 02:13:56.289]  But the United States, I don't think we're going to do anything.
[02:13:56.289 --> 02:14:04.077]  No matter how high inflation gets, we'll do our best to pretend it doesn't exist or rationalize it away because we have a lot more debt.
[02:14:04.077 --> 02:14:05.238]  I mean, America is broke.
[02:14:05.978 --> 02:14:11.662]  If you look at Europe and Japan, even though there is some debt there, overall those are still creditor nations.
[02:14:11.662 --> 02:14:13.263]  The world still owes Europe money.
[02:14:13.263 --> 02:14:14.844]  The world owes Japan money.
[02:14:14.844 --> 02:14:18.146]  But America owes more money than all the other debtor nations combined.
[02:14:18.146 --> 02:14:19.767]  I mean, Trump is right about that.
[02:14:19.767 --> 02:14:20.828]  I mean, we are broke.
[02:14:20.828 --> 02:14:25.451]  We're flat broke, and we're living off this credit bubble, and we can't prick it.
[02:14:25.451 --> 02:14:29.234]  So other central banks may be able to raise their rates, but the Fed can't.
[02:14:32.065 --> 02:14:34.248]  How do you see this unfolding?
[02:14:34.248 --> 02:14:35.429]  I mean, what are the next triggers?
[02:14:35.429 --> 02:14:39.254]  We hear about sovereign debt, we hear about corporate debt, we hear about state debt.
[02:14:39.254 --> 02:14:41.257]  I mean, what could trigger the next big implosion?
[02:14:41.257 --> 02:14:42.559]  A huge earthquake in California?
[02:14:42.559 --> 02:14:46.404]  I mean, I guess another subprime mortgage crisis they're talking about is coming soon?
[02:14:46.404 --> 02:14:47.585]  I mean, there's so many
[02:14:48.426 --> 02:14:54.033]  Iron's in the fire that I see as being able to be a trigger, or does it just keep sliding slowly?
[02:14:54.033 --> 02:15:00.341]  Because even mainline media now won't push the lie that they were just a year ago that really the economy is doing fantastic.
[02:15:00.341 --> 02:15:03.565]  The only person doing that is Obama, who says we have the best economy ever.
[02:15:03.565 --> 02:15:03.705]  Ever.
[02:15:04.486 --> 02:15:04.707]  Yeah.
[02:15:04.707 --> 02:15:09.433]  Meanwhile, you know, we got some consumer sentiment numbers come out today, much worse than expected.
[02:15:09.433 --> 02:15:13.539]  Small business sentiment came out the lowest in two years.
[02:15:13.539 --> 02:15:14.741]  That was earlier this week.
[02:15:14.741 --> 02:15:18.045]  And in fact, small business owners listed the weak U.S.
[02:15:18.045 --> 02:15:20.088]  economy as their main concern.
[02:15:20.669 --> 02:15:31.577]  I mean, so, if businesses are so concerned about the economy, how can it be so great if you've got Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders doing so well?
[02:15:31.577 --> 02:15:35.360]  Sanders is now almost neck and neck with Clinton in the national polls.
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:37.421]  He's only down by like one or two points.
[02:15:37.421 --> 02:15:41.665]  And I think Trump came out today, this is his biggest lead yet in the national polls.
[02:15:41.665 --> 02:15:42.885]  I mean, why is that?
[02:15:42.885 --> 02:15:47.769]  These are the two candidates that are the ones that are most running as anti-establishment.
[02:15:47.769 --> 02:15:48.870]  The economy is a wreck.
[02:15:49.230 --> 02:15:51.171]  And I can do something to fix it.
[02:15:51.171 --> 02:15:56.113]  If the economy was so good, these candidates wouldn't be attracting so much support.
[02:15:56.113 --> 02:15:57.513]  So, you know, you're right.
[02:15:57.513 --> 02:15:58.553]  The economy is bad.
[02:15:58.553 --> 02:16:01.254]  It's just a question of people admitting it.
[02:16:01.254 --> 02:16:07.877]  And I think the trigger, the trigger that's going to really send us into a higher gear is going to be the admission by the Fed.
[02:16:08.297 --> 02:16:20.143]  That the economy is weak, or the market's figuring it out on their own, and then you really get a decline in the dollar because now people start to realize that we're not going to get all these rate hikes that everybody's been betting on.
[02:16:20.143 --> 02:16:25.865]  We're going to get cuts, and the Fed doesn't have much room to cut because it only managed to raise rates to a quarter.
[02:16:25.865 --> 02:16:27.666]  So there's not a lot of stimulus left.
[02:16:27.666 --> 02:16:33.749]  All they've got is potentially negative rates and a huge round of quantitative easing, and this thing is going to blow up in the Fed's face.
[02:16:34.491 --> 02:16:42.260]  Sure, I mean, if the Fed's wrong about interest rates being at zero, being good, why is the IMF and World Bank, why are they cheerleading around?
[02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:50.128]  I guess IMF's more European, World Bank's more U.S., but it's, I mean, the two are connected at the hip, but both those groups are basically saying the same thing.
[02:16:50.967 --> 02:16:52.228]  Yeah, well, they're not any smarter.
[02:16:52.228 --> 02:16:54.590]  In fact, the IMF is still projecting the U.S.
[02:16:54.590 --> 02:17:03.776]  economy to grow at about 2.2% this year, which, you know, there's no chance of that happening because if you look at how bad the first quarter is, the rest of the year is going to have to be above 3%.
[02:17:03.776 --> 02:17:07.359]  And I don't know why the IMF would actually believe that.
[02:17:07.739 --> 02:17:09.500]  It's more this propaganda.
[02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:11.341]  The IMF, they're a bunch of bureaucrats.
[02:17:11.341 --> 02:17:19.166]  They want to believe that the US economy is going to be strong because that's the Federal Reserve, that's the central bank's program.
[02:17:19.166 --> 02:17:24.770]  I mean, the government is trying to create economic growth and the IMF wants to pretend that they're successful.
[02:17:24.770 --> 02:17:27.372]  They don't want to acknowledge all this government failure.
[02:17:27.372 --> 02:17:31.454]  The only way to get real economic growth is to get the government out of the way.
[02:17:31.454 --> 02:17:32.455]  Institutions like the IMF
[02:17:33.859 --> 02:17:34.820]  I agree.
[02:17:34.820 --> 02:17:42.723]  We're about to go to break, and I want to come back and ask you just front and center, because you're the expert, other key things about the economy you want to impart to folks.
[02:17:42.723 --> 02:17:43.423]  Peter Schiff's our guest.
[02:17:43.423 --> 02:17:46.165]  But separately, I'm not happy the economy's falling apart.
[02:17:46.165 --> 02:17:47.625]  I'm not happy we're on a bubble.
[02:17:47.625 --> 02:17:48.566]  I'm not doom and gloom.
[02:17:48.566 --> 02:17:50.507]  I just want to be honest with people.
[02:17:50.507 --> 02:17:54.868]  Our audience has been roughly doubling every year for the last five or six years.
[02:17:54.868 --> 02:17:56.309]  It's growing even faster.
[02:17:56.309 --> 02:18:00.251]  More affiliates, more people watching videos, more people watching podcasts.
[02:18:00.251 --> 02:18:01.711]  Until, I mean, this didn't even happen in 2008.
[02:18:02.972 --> 02:18:07.335]  But until about two or three years ago, as audience went up, our money went up.
[02:18:07.335 --> 02:18:11.277]  The amount of money coming in went up so I could expand with reporters and writers and everything else.
[02:18:11.277 --> 02:18:13.038]  Audience is bigger, more money comes in.
[02:18:13.038 --> 02:18:18.981]  For the first time ever in the last few years, our audience is exploding, but money is not going up, Peter.
[02:18:18.981 --> 02:18:21.543]  And I've gotten better at sponsors and raising money.
[02:18:21.823 --> 02:18:24.586]  So despite every trick I've got, it's harder than ever.
[02:18:24.586 --> 02:18:27.330]  Most media, as you know, is downsizing or going out of business.
[02:18:27.330 --> 02:18:32.436]  So I'm seeing it, even in a quote, boom town, where we're based like Austin, Texas.
[02:18:32.436 --> 02:18:35.319]  I'm seeing it across the country.
[02:18:35.319 --> 02:18:36.260]  Yeah, well, absolutely.
[02:18:36.260 --> 02:18:37.602]  I mean, people have less money.
[02:18:37.602 --> 02:18:38.843]  People have less money to spend.
[02:18:38.843 --> 02:18:41.766]  And so advertisers are cutting back and everybody's feeling it.
[02:18:42.921 --> 02:18:46.584]  So, so, I mean, you think that we may already actually be in a recession?
[02:18:46.584 --> 02:18:52.630]  Yeah, well, all of the indicators, if you look at most of the economic indicators that are out there, they're flashing recession.
[02:18:52.630 --> 02:18:57.654]  I mean, the only thing that isn't is the low unemployment rate and the jobs that we're creating.
[02:18:57.654 --> 02:19:02.118]  But then when you look beneath the surface, and we've discussed this before on your program, when you realize...
[02:19:02.899 --> 02:19:03.099]  I think?
[02:19:24.230 --> 02:19:26.791]  People are being hired that not that many people are being fired.
[02:19:26.791 --> 02:19:28.812]  You can't lose a job unless you get a job.
[02:19:28.812 --> 02:19:34.695]  And so since we're really creating so few legitimate jobs, there's not a lot of people that are collecting unemployment.
[02:19:34.695 --> 02:19:40.857]  So this economy is very weak, despite the rosy scenario, the fiction that the president is trying to paint.
[02:19:40.857 --> 02:19:42.658]  But Wall Street still doesn't get it.
[02:19:42.658 --> 02:19:49.221]  You know, if you look at performance, investment performance in the first quarter, this was the worst quarter for actively managed accounts in 18 years.
[02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:50.563]  Peter, stay there.
[02:19:50.563 --> 02:19:53.950]  Let's talk about the real state of the economy, the next shooter drop, and more straight ahead.
[02:19:53.950 --> 02:19:55.653]  Peter Schiff, Europact.com.
[02:19:55.653 --> 02:19:57.597]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[02:19:57.597 --> 02:19:57.998]  Stay with us.
[02:20:03.365 --> 02:20:08.148]  Hey, I rode the elevator with you, but I don't work on the upper floors.
[02:20:08.148 --> 02:20:15.013]  I just want to squeeze in there right next to you, so the RFID scanner in my pocket can capture all your personal information.
[02:20:15.013 --> 02:20:18.515]  Your debit and credit cards, even your work ID badge.

[02:20:21.437 --> 02:20:21.898]  Going up.
[02:20:22.834 --> 02:20:30.797]  So am I. For over 10 years, ID Stronghold has pioneered RFID-blocking wallets and ID badge holders for consumers, the U.S.
[02:20:30.797 --> 02:20:34.098]  military, and even the Executive Office of the President.
[02:20:34.098 --> 02:20:36.218]  Shouldn't you be protected too?
[02:20:36.218 --> 02:20:41.200]  ID Stronghold wallets cost about the same as wallets in most stores, but give you extra protection.
[02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:44.221]  I'm Wal Augustinowitz, founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.

[02:21:30.952 --> 02:21:32.753]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:21:32.753 --> 02:21:34.053]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:21:34.053 --> 02:21:37.296]  I've defended myself from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:21:37.296 --> 02:21:39.597]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:21:39.597 --> 02:21:44.100]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[02:21:59.699 --> 02:22:04.041]  Biochemistry determines your mood, memory, energy, and endurance.
[02:22:04.041 --> 02:22:07.063]  Your body's primary metabolic function is to make protein.
[02:22:07.063 --> 02:22:10.004]  One World Whey is a unique, non-denatured protein.
[02:22:10.004 --> 02:22:18.389]  This enables your body to have virtually 100% utilization, whereas typical whey protein powders offer no more than 18% utilization of protein.
[02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:21.510]  One World Whey also delivers life-giving frequencies to your cells.
[02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:26.853]  The net result for so many people is improved energy, mood, and elimination of pain from inflammation.
[02:22:27.073 --> 02:22:31.515]  This technologically enhanced One World Way has been really amazing for me.
[02:22:31.515 --> 02:22:37.879]  I'm 36 years old and for the past several years I've been struggling with lack of energy, dry and stamina.
[02:22:37.879 --> 02:22:41.941]  And after just two weeks on this product I'm feeling so much more energy.
[02:22:41.941 --> 02:22:48.225]  My yoga practice has deepened and as a massage therapist I'm able to see more clients than I've been able to in years.
[02:22:48.225 --> 02:22:51.367]  I've never felt results that quick with anything I've ever taken.

[02:23:55.881 --> 02:23:58.242]  From the Robert Allen System, current returns not indicative of future results.
[02:24:11.906 --> 02:24:15.871]  The reason I'm talking about earthquakes is I'm going to talk to someone about that in the next segment.
[02:24:15.871 --> 02:24:18.674]  I'm not totally obsessed with volcanoes and earthquakes.
[02:24:18.674 --> 02:24:19.756]  Some people really are into that.
[02:24:19.756 --> 02:24:20.597]  They like those movies.
[02:24:20.597 --> 02:24:22.279]  They're always worried about it.
[02:24:22.279 --> 02:24:25.062]  I guess you kind of do if you live in California or something.
[02:24:25.062 --> 02:24:25.923]  Or Japan, but...
[02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:32.685]  They are saying, all the seismologists, California's way overdue, it's going to be like an 8.0 or bigger.
[02:24:32.685 --> 02:24:33.845]  What will that do to the economy?
[02:24:33.845 --> 02:24:37.889]  But it's a parallel to the economy already.
[02:24:37.889 --> 02:24:44.274]  People just don't think it's going to happen until it happens, and we're lined up for the biggest group of bubbles we've ever seen.
[02:24:44.274 --> 02:24:50.419]  Even, you know, the Royal Bank of Scotland says sell everything you've got, you know, end of the world type stuff, now coming out of George Soros and others.
[02:24:51.621 --> 02:24:56.149]  And so I'm just asking, wow, you know, is that just hype or how big is it going to be?
[02:24:56.149 --> 02:24:58.212]  Is there any way to avoid it?
[02:24:58.212 --> 02:25:01.357]  Peter Schiff was just getting into some of the numbers coming out, Peter.
[02:25:02.588 --> 02:25:17.199]  Well, no, I was talking before the break about how investors still just don't get what's going on, because for the past several years, everybody's been positioned as if this recovery were real, that it was sustainable, and that the Fed could normalize interest rates and everything was going to be fine.
[02:25:17.199 --> 02:25:20.221]  So they've been buying dollars, they've been buying certain assets.
[02:25:20.221 --> 02:25:27.847]  And the first quarter of this year, investment returns, it was the worst quarter in 18 years for actively managed funds.
[02:25:27.847 --> 02:25:31.130]  Most hedge funds lost money, barely any made any money at all.
[02:25:31.670 --> 02:25:32.971]  I guess they still don't get it.
[02:25:32.971 --> 02:25:35.232]  They still don't understand what's changed.
[02:25:35.232 --> 02:25:43.558]  Meanwhile, at Europe's Civic Capital, we had one of our best quarters in years, probably since 2009, because we're positioned for reality.
[02:25:43.558 --> 02:25:48.901]  I've been saying for the last few years, as this bubble's been inflating, that this whole narrative has been wrong.
[02:25:48.901 --> 02:25:51.843]  That the Federal Reserve has not solved our problems, but exacerbated them.
[02:25:51.843 --> 02:25:54.105]  And you said that before 2008, so let me ask you this.
[02:25:54.705 --> 02:26:02.587]  I mean, speaking of earthquakes, you're famous for quoting, I mean, famous for this quote, 2008 was a tremor for the earthquake that's coming.
[02:26:02.587 --> 02:26:03.447]  Is that what you're still saying?
[02:26:03.447 --> 02:26:13.309]  Yeah, and I've been saying that all along, even before 2008, because I saw 2008 coming, and unfortunately I also saw how the government would respond to 2008.
[02:26:13.309 --> 02:26:21.691]  And they did exactly what I feared that they would do, and what I warned they would do, and that is exactly why the real earthquake is still in our future.
[02:26:21.691 --> 02:26:24.092]  It's not in our past, and people have to prepare for that.
[02:26:24.412 --> 02:26:28.996]  And by the way, you know, silver hit a new high today for this year, for 2016.
[02:26:28.996 --> 02:26:30.617]  So people are starting to wake up.
[02:26:30.617 --> 02:26:33.299]  It's happening very slowly, but it's happening.
[02:26:33.299 --> 02:26:34.120]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:42.747]  I mean, I think Dent's really smart, and I agree with him on a lot of stuff, but when he thinks because gold is so finite, that's why it's not valuable.
[02:26:42.747 --> 02:26:49.312]  I mean, the laws of economics I've seen, that makes it more valuable, and it has industrial uses, and all these elites are hoarding it.
[02:26:50.427 --> 02:26:50.787]  He's got
[02:27:13.183 --> 02:27:14.003]  Well, what about this, though?
[02:27:14.003 --> 02:27:18.345]  We now know they've been manipulating gold and silver down, as you said many years ago was going on, and others did.
[02:27:18.345 --> 02:27:20.046]  They now admit that so much is rigged.
[02:27:20.046 --> 02:27:23.947]  So, like the stock market, so much of it, like the interest rates, currency rates.
[02:27:23.947 --> 02:27:25.988]  I mean, how does rigging tie into it?
[02:27:25.988 --> 02:27:27.589]  Because they always come up with new tricks.
[02:27:28.632 --> 02:27:30.713]  Yeah, well, you know, you can only do that for so long.
[02:27:30.713 --> 02:27:34.856]  Look, if the government really could manipulate the gold market, gold wouldn't be at $1,220.
[02:27:34.856 --> 02:27:38.799]  It would still be, you know, down at $300 or lower where it was in 2000.
[02:27:38.799 --> 02:27:43.022]  You know, if they can rig markets... Well, we know they're trying is what I'm saying.
[02:27:43.022 --> 02:27:45.463]  Yeah, they try, but they're not going to succeed.
[02:27:45.463 --> 02:27:46.944]  The markets are much bigger.
[02:27:46.944 --> 02:27:48.765]  The fundamentals ultimately win out.
[02:27:48.765 --> 02:27:53.989]  They can succeed in delaying the inevitable, but all that does is make the inevitable bigger, right?
[02:27:53.989 --> 02:27:58.392]  So if the government is trying to prevent gold from going up when it eventually does go up,
[02:27:58.772 --> 02:27:59.713]  It's going to go up even higher.
[02:27:59.713 --> 02:28:01.073]  Well, that's what they say about earthquakes, too.
[02:28:01.073 --> 02:28:05.255]  They say the fact that California is way overdue means there's even more pressure when it finally hits.
[02:28:05.255 --> 02:28:07.256]  Are you saying it's the same for economics?
[02:28:07.256 --> 02:28:10.818]  Yeah, I mean, those tremors are good because they take the pressure off the faults.
[02:28:10.818 --> 02:28:13.339]  You need the little tremors so you don't have a bigger quake.
[02:28:13.339 --> 02:28:15.320]  But think about wage and price controls.
[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:25.465]  You know, what happens when the government has a price control on something for a while because they try to cover up the symptoms of inflation and then they give up and they take away the controls and then you get a huge spike in price.
[02:28:25.845 --> 02:28:29.587]  So if the government's going to try to manipulate the market, it's not going to last.
[02:28:29.587 --> 02:28:34.150]  But a lot of the manipulation isn't really manipulation, it's just people being foolish.
[02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:39.174]  You've got big banks like Goldman Sachs shorting gold, telling their clients to short gold.
[02:28:39.174 --> 02:28:43.516]  A lot of people unfortunately listen to Goldman Sachs, and they're doing the wrong thing.
[02:28:43.516 --> 02:28:45.938]  So a lot of times the markets are just mispriced.
[02:28:46.238 --> 02:28:48.000]  Because so many people don't get it.
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:52.665]  Just like all the people who were buying the subprime mortgages before the bottom dropped out of the market.
[02:28:52.665 --> 02:28:57.070]  Or all the people who were buying those dot-com stocks for several years before they collapsed.
[02:28:57.070 --> 02:28:58.251]  So the same thing's gonna happen now.
[02:28:58.251 --> 02:28:59.393]  There's a lot of people following...
[02:29:01.684 --> 02:29:05.327]  Peter, Skype cut out for just a moment, we're trying to reconnect with them here at the end.
[02:29:05.327 --> 02:29:11.293]  You know, my job's fun in many ways, it's also scary, but the good news is, time goes on, we're going to get to find out who's right in all this.
[02:29:11.293 --> 02:29:21.543]  Peter, your Skype cut out for a moment, but EuroPAC.com, do you think it'll be evident that we're in a real global recession soon, in the next few months, or will it take later?
[02:29:21.543 --> 02:29:22.984]  Well, look, I think it's more of a US...
[02:29:25.469 --> 02:29:27.070]  All right, Peter Schiff is gone.
[02:29:27.070 --> 02:29:28.470]  Hey, it's okay, it's got cut out at the end.
[02:29:28.470 --> 02:29:30.191]  Thank you, Peter, for joining us.
[02:29:30.191 --> 02:29:34.372]  EuroPAC.com, AlexJonesWithInfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:29:34.372 --> 02:29:39.974]  Speaking of tremors, speaking of volcanoes, I'm going to hit some articles on that when we come back.
[02:29:39.974 --> 02:29:41.535]  Liam McAdoo cut an important report.
[02:29:41.535 --> 02:29:43.315]  I've been hearing air on that subject as well.
[02:29:43.315 --> 02:29:48.297]  We'll get into the economy, some military news, a lot more than our reporters on the ground in Denver, Colorado.
[02:29:49.420 --> 02:29:53.341]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.341 --> 02:30:00.182]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.182 --> 02:30:06.083]  A Connecticut judge has placed herself above the Constitution and above an explicit congressional law.
[02:30:06.083 --> 02:30:13.984]  Judge Barbara Bellis has ruled that Sandy Hook families can sue gun manufacturers Remington, Bushmaster, and others.
[02:30:13.984 --> 02:30:18.805]  But Congress has already explicitly protected firearm manufacturers from liability
[02:30:19.065 --> 02:30:34.550]  In the Protection of Lawful Commerce and Arms Act, which says they will not be held liable for, quote, the harm caused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse firearm products or ammunition products that function as designed and intended.
[02:30:34.550 --> 02:30:48.674]  The act goes on to explain to people with an anti-gun agenda like Judge Bellis that, quote, the possibility of imposing liability on an entire industry for harm that is solely caused by others is an abuse of the legal system, unquote.
[02:30:48.854 --> 02:30:49.594]  What's next?
[02:30:49.594 --> 02:30:53.576]  Holding Ford liable for a drunk driver killing someone with the car that they made?
[02:30:53.576 --> 02:30:57.478]  If Hillary Clinton has her way, that's what they will do to gun manufacturers.
[02:30:57.478 --> 02:30:59.319]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:31:09.244 --> 02:31:10.305]  That is like no other.
[02:31:10.305 --> 02:31:16.228]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:31:16.228 --> 02:31:33.099]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[02:31:59.676 --> 02:32:00.496]  Hey, everyone!
[02:32:00.496 --> 02:32:02.777]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[02:32:02.777 --> 02:32:06.618]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:32:06.618 --> 02:32:08.698]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:32:08.698 --> 02:32:18.981]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:32:18.981 --> 02:32:24.962]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:32:25.422 --> 02:32:40.333]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[02:32:40.393 --> 02:32:40.953]  I think so.
[02:33:03.058 --> 02:33:05.981]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[02:33:05.981 --> 02:33:07.002]  Let me think, just let me think.
[02:33:07.002 --> 02:33:12.548]  I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[02:33:12.548 --> 02:33:13.949]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[02:33:13.949 --> 02:33:14.650]  Damn it!
[02:33:14.650 --> 02:33:15.711]  Why?
[02:33:15.711 --> 02:33:19.675]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words...
[02:33:22.299 --> 02:33:27.800]  Words are for the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
[02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:33.081]  But the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[02:33:33.081 --> 02:33:34.102]  You designed it, sir.
[02:33:34.102 --> 02:33:35.042]  You wanted it foolproof.
[02:33:35.042 --> 02:33:36.702]  You told me every television in London!
[02:33:36.702 --> 02:33:40.603]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and depression.
[02:33:40.603 --> 02:33:50.005]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and suppressing your discipline.
[02:33:50.305 --> 02:33:51.085]  We need cameras.
[02:34:06.309 --> 02:34:07.790]  I know why you did it.
[02:34:07.790 --> 02:34:09.371]  I know you were afraid.
[02:34:09.371 --> 02:34:11.032]  Who wouldn't be?
[02:34:11.032 --> 02:34:11.772]  War?
[02:34:11.772 --> 02:34:12.412]  Terror?
[02:34:12.412 --> 02:34:13.713]  Disease?
[02:34:13.713 --> 02:34:20.157]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[02:34:20.157 --> 02:34:26.540]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[02:34:26.540 --> 02:34:32.724]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[02:34:37.915 --> 02:34:39.436]  There is a war.
[02:34:39.436 --> 02:34:41.037]  There is a war.
[02:34:41.037 --> 02:34:42.998]  It's happening now.
[02:34:42.998 --> 02:34:45.359]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:34:45.359 --> 02:34:47.940]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:34:47.940 --> 02:34:49.841]  We are the resistance.
[02:34:49.841 --> 02:34:57.505]  We are the InfoWars.
[02:34:57.505 --> 02:35:02.187]  There's a lot of amazing news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:35:02.187 --> 02:35:03.628]  We're going to be covering some of it.
[02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:14.888]  But if you're watching us on television, you see our standard yellow star, we call it the Sun, that we orbit.
[02:35:14.888 --> 02:35:26.297]  Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and then out into the gas giants, and the Kuiper Belt.
[02:35:26.297 --> 02:35:32.983]  And one of the biggest threats is out there between the gas giants, and that's the asteroid field.
[02:35:35.199 --> 02:35:46.802]  It's estimated that there's the equivalent of hundreds of planets worth of wreckage floating in orbit around the Sun.
[02:35:46.802 --> 02:35:56.664]  And a lot of those get kicked out on different tracks, along with comets and other planetary visitors, and plunge into the Earth's surface.
[02:35:56.664 --> 02:36:04.026]  They even have serious Discovery Channel scientific programs, where they now show satellite photos of the huge craters all over the world.
[02:36:05.626 --> 02:36:13.669]  Before the Shoemaker-Levy comet... Was it Saturn it plunged into?
[02:36:13.669 --> 02:36:14.049]  Jupiter.
[02:36:14.049 --> 02:36:17.111]  Yeah, I remember having Shoemaker and Levy on before they died in a car wreck.
[02:36:17.111 --> 02:36:20.372]  Or the Shoemaker family have had Levy on after they died.
[02:36:20.372 --> 02:36:23.853]  Amateur professional quasi.
[02:36:23.853 --> 02:36:28.435]  Finding that comet and then estimating that it would hit Jupiter.
[02:36:28.435 --> 02:36:32.336]  And then the comet blowing holes.
[02:36:32.336 --> 02:36:32.957]  Six holes.
[02:36:33.945 --> 02:36:41.850]  As it broke up coming into the atmosphere, bigger than Earth.
[02:36:41.850 --> 02:36:44.953]  Some people even thought it might ignite, but it didn't.
[02:36:44.953 --> 02:36:47.134]  The gas giant.
[02:36:47.134 --> 02:36:48.095]  And turn it into a sun.
[02:36:49.952 --> 02:36:54.853]  In fact, if Jupiter got ignited, many estimate it would be a smaller second sun.
[02:36:54.853 --> 02:36:57.894]  That's what the whole 2001 Space Odyssey thing ends with.
[02:36:57.894 --> 02:37:05.536]  And when Jupiter ignites into a sun and destroys the wormhole gate that's there, it's called Lucifer.
[02:37:05.536 --> 02:37:09.357]  So that's all the occultism of the establishment.
[02:37:09.357 --> 02:37:10.957]  And how they flaunt it in everybody's face.
[02:37:10.957 --> 02:37:14.618]  There was even a leaked
[02:37:15.817 --> 02:37:19.240]  NASA planned to actually run that project.
[02:37:19.240 --> 02:37:24.545]  But, I digress.
[02:37:24.545 --> 02:37:29.048]  It was blowing holes in the side of the planet, the gas giant.
[02:37:29.048 --> 02:37:32.531]  Go look it up for yourself, I'm going from memory here.
[02:37:32.531 --> 02:37:38.376]  Bigger than the Earth.
[02:37:38.376 --> 02:37:40.178]  Now, that's the universe we live in.
[02:37:42.014 --> 02:37:51.201]  And the United Nations voted back in Copenhagen when they were pushing a World Government Conference five, six years ago, that the sun does not affect climate.
[02:37:51.201 --> 02:37:54.023]  Well, we know it's the main driver of climate.
[02:37:54.023 --> 02:38:01.989]  Tectonic energies are clearly, according to all the scientists I've interviewed, the experts.
[02:38:01.989 --> 02:38:04.931]  Again, I've gone and interviewed the experts.
[02:38:04.931 --> 02:38:07.674]  They always say, oh, you're not a scientist, you can't speak to these things.
[02:38:07.674 --> 02:38:10.476]  Barbara Boxer talking down to people like they're idiots.
[02:38:11.837 --> 02:38:13.538]  Like she only has the knowledge.
[02:38:13.538 --> 02:38:18.819]  That's an MSNBC attitude that anybody else that doesn't do exactly what they say is dumb and they're so smart.
[02:38:18.819 --> 02:38:23.041]  Then you go meet one of their followers, they can hardly talk.
[02:38:23.041 --> 02:38:30.183]  They're just ruled by these arrogant crones that sit up on them as mob bosses trying to ban free speech and restrict all these liberties.
[02:38:30.183 --> 02:38:36.746]  And oh, let's Bill Nye the science guy, let's arrest anybody that disagrees with man-made climate change.
[02:38:36.746 --> 02:38:37.586]  Thought it was warming!
[02:38:42.731 --> 02:38:47.473]  And so what I'm getting at here is the next big force is tectonic.
[02:38:47.473 --> 02:38:56.135]  The next big heat source is the Earth, still molten from its creation and the pressures of its mass.
[02:38:56.135 --> 02:38:59.296]  There's a debate whether the moon has a molten center or not.
[02:38:59.296 --> 02:39:00.837]  Most scientists think it's probably cool by now.
[02:39:00.837 --> 02:39:04.918]  It doesn't have the pressures needed to continue to heat.
[02:39:04.918 --> 02:39:06.759]  But those are some of the mysteries of the universe.
[02:39:08.427 --> 02:39:15.571]  Those are some of the things that scientists are still trying to completely discover.
[02:39:15.571 --> 02:39:18.133]  But we're in a very active universe.
[02:39:27.133 --> 02:39:39.300]  And then most experts agree, and this is the compendium of research, that the third driver of climate on the earth, number one is the sun, number two is tectonic movement and heat, number three is the moon.
[02:39:39.300 --> 02:39:55.590]  The moon is huge, it controls the tides, it manipulates what's happening inside the earth, it has a massive effect on when plants and animals release their pollen, when they mate, when the fish run, it's all known to be kind of the clock of the earth.
[02:39:57.392 --> 02:40:03.537]  And also the space winds and the solar winds are blocked by the moon.
[02:40:03.537 --> 02:40:12.343]  Even though it's smaller than the Earth, when the winds go over it, they have radio telescope shots of this and magnetic field telescopes.
[02:40:12.343 --> 02:40:15.646]  It goes like a teardrop over it.
[02:40:15.646 --> 02:40:23.511]  And the moon, when properly positioned, completely blocks the Earth from solar radiation and space winds.
[02:40:23.511 --> 02:40:25.193]  Pretty amazing, huh?
[02:40:25.193 --> 02:40:26.634]  Or space winds coming from that direction.
[02:40:28.083 --> 02:40:34.985]  There's just all sorts of different types of radiation and fields and light and dark matter energy that they know is there.
[02:40:34.985 --> 02:40:36.046]  They can read it on meters.
[02:40:36.046 --> 02:40:42.888]  It's stronger than our energy, but they can't tell what it is because it's interdimensional.
[02:40:42.888 --> 02:40:50.271]  But they see the pressure wavelengths of whatever's in those other dimensions weighing in.
[02:40:50.271 --> 02:40:56.833]  And they have lower dimensional fields showing up and higher dimensional fields and then other other dimensional fields and vortexes.
[02:40:59.602 --> 02:41:17.030]  And then we have the establishment telling us that men reading teleprompters, walking around on red carpets, with foppish, sycophantic crowds, telling them they're gods.
[02:41:17.030 --> 02:41:28.895]  And these are the people that endanger our planet, that have created all sorts of super high-tech weapons, and now think they're god, or genetically engineering every species they can get their hands on, that are creating cross-species chimeras,
[02:41:30.939 --> 02:41:33.095]  Chimera, chimera.
[02:41:33.095 --> 02:41:33.841]  Potato, potata.
[02:41:36.129 --> 02:41:41.692]  And there's just no sense of restraint in the race for power, because, well, if we create the new A.I.
[02:41:41.692 --> 02:41:44.553]  supercomputers, it'll merge with us, we'll live forever!
[02:41:44.553 --> 02:42:04.942]  And if we do all the genetic engineering randomly with gene guns, randomly spricing thousands of species a day at major laboratories, we'll find new super secrets, and we'll implant the humans and humanoid cows and sheep that are part human and won't reject it, and the best part is, the animals have no rights, and the humans have no rights, because they're not actually human or animal, and then the environmentalists are controlled by us, through the globalist think tanks with Dr. Peter Singer,
[02:42:05.522 --> 02:42:09.784]  And PETA is really the Animal Liberation Front, and we're in control and guide the whole movement.
[02:42:09.784 --> 02:42:11.725]  Don't worry anybody about the real problems.
[02:42:11.725 --> 02:42:12.505]  Ha ha!
[02:42:12.505 --> 02:42:18.068]  See, we got it all figured out.
[02:42:18.068 --> 02:42:23.330]  They got it all figured out.
[02:42:23.330 --> 02:42:27.292]  They know what they're doing.
[02:42:27.292 --> 02:42:32.775]  And I was talking to my lawyer yesterday.
[02:42:34.718 --> 02:42:37.180]  Yeah, let's look at that headline for a second.
[02:42:37.180 --> 02:42:41.983]  What's that out of the Express?
[02:42:41.983 --> 02:42:43.805]  Yeah, London Express.
[02:42:43.805 --> 02:42:44.265]  Yeah, look at that.
[02:42:44.265 --> 02:42:49.048]  Scientists open mass cloning factory this year to clone cows, pets, and humans.
[02:42:49.048 --> 02:42:51.510]  And notice they always act like it hadn't really been developed yet.
[02:42:51.510 --> 02:42:55.413]  They've been cloning since the 30s with rabbits.
[02:42:55.413 --> 02:42:59.096]  They've been cloning humans we know since the 50s.
[02:42:59.096 --> 02:43:02.138]  And they just always, oh, we don't know if we can do that like we're children.
[02:43:10.285 --> 02:43:14.827]  And they've got all these weird cross-species animals you can buy that rich people are getting and stuff now.
[02:43:14.827 --> 02:43:16.687]  And you tell the general public that they just roll their eyes.
[02:43:16.687 --> 02:43:24.090]  They have cross-species salmon that's three times bigger and they admit is going to extinct regular salmon already in the ocean.
[02:43:24.090 --> 02:43:26.111]  Oh, they magically just let it go.
[02:43:26.111 --> 02:43:28.992]  Oh, oops, they're playing God, folks.
[02:43:28.992 --> 02:43:30.133]  They're on power trips.
[02:43:30.133 --> 02:43:36.515]  They're playing dice, Russian roulette, on purpose for the nihilistic thrill of doing it all.
[02:43:40.239 --> 02:43:41.860]  And I've said it before, I'll say it again.
[02:43:41.860 --> 02:43:44.122]  I don't know if there was a real Atlantis.
[02:43:44.122 --> 02:43:46.043]  Plato said it was real.
[02:43:46.043 --> 02:43:47.084]  Other cultures did as well.
[02:43:47.084 --> 02:43:51.126]  Blew up out by the Atlantic Ocean.
[02:43:51.126 --> 02:43:54.849]  They found all sorts of weird isotopes in the rock that submarines have gotten in the different areas.
[02:44:00.011 --> 02:44:01.252]  Here's what I'm getting at.
[02:44:01.252 --> 02:44:06.056]  Whether it's comets or whether it's asteroids, you add in new threat matrices.
[02:44:06.056 --> 02:44:17.525]  Because previously, scientists said, oh, we believe every few million years a comet or huge asteroid that causes an Earth-changing event that darkens the skies for a few years, creates a mini ice age, and kills most of the life forms.
[02:44:17.525 --> 02:44:19.087]  We think it happens every million, two million years.
[02:44:19.087 --> 02:44:28.595]  Now scientists have gone and they've studied the rock in thousands of large craters, hundreds of humongous ones,
[02:44:29.619 --> 02:44:35.206]  Bigger than Meteor Crater, you know, out in Arizona.
[02:44:35.206 --> 02:44:41.073]  And they know that it happens probably every couple hundred thousand years or more.
[02:44:41.073 --> 02:44:46.499]  Because they find ice ages in the ice core samples that weren't a couple thousand years long.
[02:44:47.580 --> 02:45:10.363]  On the dormancy cycle of the sun every 10-12,000 years, they're finding little ones, and partial ones all over, and then they check the isotopes, and they check the different compound minerals that are created, and they know the signature of even certain meteors, and what they were made out of, and what those meteors slash asteroids did.
[02:45:11.792 --> 02:45:16.814]  And so we're sitting here with a clock going t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t
[02:45:37.179 --> 02:45:59.614]  Well, they're all racing as fast as they can to get life extension, and they think supercomputers will be so fast and so great, they'll just manifest all these super technologies overnight in the singularity, when the singularity is just something that Ray Kurzweil came up with, who thinks he's going to resurrect his dead dad with his dad's diary and papers.
[02:46:01.246 --> 02:46:04.167]  No, Kurzweil, you're not gonna resurrect your dead dad with that.
[02:46:04.167 --> 02:46:11.989]  Maybe in the future you could record everything in his brain, have a copy of it, and claim that was really him, but it won't be his essence, his soul, his spirit.
[02:46:11.989 --> 02:46:17.050]  But your daddy ain't coming back, whack job!
[02:46:17.050 --> 02:46:21.111]  And you're not gonna become the first god!
[02:46:21.111 --> 02:46:25.292]  Look around you, brother, there is a real god, you ain't it, I ain't it.
[02:46:25.292 --> 02:46:28.233]  You arrogant, narcissistic, loon bag.
[02:46:29.392 --> 02:46:34.095]  I deal with so many crazy people in my life, and they're savage, they're nuts, they think they're invincible.
[02:46:34.095 --> 02:46:38.817]  They're easy to defeat, like a lobotomized zombie, but you still gotta deal with them.
[02:46:38.817 --> 02:46:47.161]  It's like having one of your backyards crawling along, and you can't sit there and have lemonade, you're gonna fall asleep as soon as you chew your throat out.
[02:46:47.161 --> 02:46:50.003]  They just think they're so smart.
[02:46:50.003 --> 02:46:53.305]  The arrogance, the delusion, because we've created an artificial world,
[02:46:54.298 --> 02:46:57.099]  People don't have to live in the real confines of the real world.
[02:46:57.099 --> 02:47:05.283]  People started fights, they've pushed people around, they've done stuff and they've never had to get their nose broken for it.
[02:47:05.283 --> 02:47:15.908]  That's why they want a nanny state so all these little babies are delusional and don't live in the real world and don't understand what's really going on and don't have any real ideas about what they're dealing with.
[02:47:16.530 --> 02:47:24.336]  So they're not worried about NSA spying, they're not worried about checkpoints, they're not worried about forced vaccines, they're not worried about GMO, they're not worried about anything because they are delusional.
[02:47:24.336 --> 02:47:41.510]  Until they get cancer, or until they get a neurological disorder, then they go to the races and sit in the stands, you know, dying of cancer, and everybody waves at them when they go for the jog, you know, the 10K to raise money, and then they feel like a victim and are a movie star while they're dying and, you know, get all into it.
[02:47:43.663 --> 02:47:46.265]  They've got a whole program for you.
[02:47:46.265 --> 02:47:50.488]  And oh, the end of humanity is coming and we'll all be little rock stars during it.
[02:47:50.488 --> 02:47:53.290]  We all knew our species was bad and we're all just going to accept it.
[02:47:58.021 --> 02:48:01.304]  So you think nothing's gonna happen to you till it's happening to you.
[02:48:01.304 --> 02:48:03.186]  And I'm telling you folks, it is happening to you.
[02:48:03.186 --> 02:48:06.869]  Our children are being brain damaged and brainwashed by the TV and the screen time.
[02:48:06.869 --> 02:48:09.672]  The GMO is killing us and changing our DNA.
[02:48:09.672 --> 02:48:14.316]  The elite are like psycho mad scientists on PCP.
[02:48:14.316 --> 02:48:18.480]  There are hundreds of volcanoes suddenly becoming active at a level they've never seen in modern history.
[02:48:19.431 --> 02:48:28.295]  There are all sorts of sinkholes forming everywhere, earthquakes happening all over the place, crazy mass die-offs and stuff going on, all sorts of secret testing going on.
[02:48:28.295 --> 02:48:35.439]  The elite are trying to kill the planet, as best I can tell, while they claim they're trying to save it.
[02:48:35.439 --> 02:48:39.521]  High school textbooks we've shown you teach children that there is chemtrailing going on.
[02:48:41.462 --> 02:48:43.042]  And that they're doing it to save the Earth.
[02:48:43.042 --> 02:48:49.284]  I got sent links this weekend by friends that it was on Weather Channel admitting they're chemtrailing us and how they do it for our own good.
[02:48:49.284 --> 02:48:51.665]  See, it doesn't exist, but we're doing it.
[02:48:51.665 --> 02:48:54.205]  There is a global government, but we're doing it.
[02:48:54.205 --> 02:48:58.767]  There is a secret Department of Energy program, but it's not what the kooks say, it's for your own good.
[02:48:58.767 --> 02:49:03.588]  And then we find out all over the world, the aluminum's getting so high, plants can't grow and are dying.
[02:49:05.259 --> 02:49:07.741]  Why are you doing this New World Order?
[02:49:07.741 --> 02:49:09.763]  Well, you come to kill, steal, and destroy.
[02:49:09.763 --> 02:49:11.905]  I mean, I'm not saying you're the devil.
[02:49:11.905 --> 02:49:13.886]  That's what the Bible says he does.
[02:49:13.886 --> 02:49:16.068]  You want to come to kill, steal, and destroy.
[02:49:16.068 --> 02:49:20.792]  And you go about like a lion, roaring, seeing who you may devour.
[02:49:24.093 --> 02:49:33.397]  Because I used to think that was like in, you know, Friday the 13th movies where the guy's woman's running and she falls down on purpose and then crawls on her, you know, legs.
[02:49:33.397 --> 02:49:35.398]  I used to think, oh, that's made up.
[02:49:35.398 --> 02:49:42.361]  Then I've actually seen video and footage now and, you know, crime scene stuff where that's actually what a lot of people do is they fall down.
[02:49:42.361 --> 02:49:43.882]  Someone walks their house with a butcher knife.
[02:49:44.802 --> 02:49:48.144]  Grown men just go, ahhh, and the person gets to stab them.
[02:49:48.144 --> 02:49:50.205]  That was bred into you.
[02:49:50.205 --> 02:50:00.291]  The wimpiest person 100 years ago, I don't care if it was the US, Africa, Germany, Mexico, I don't care where you were, you come pull an eye on anybody, they're going to fight you because they got an instinct.
[02:50:00.291 --> 02:50:02.652]  But see, they flipped the instinct off.
[02:50:04.224 --> 02:50:06.206]  I mean, somebody walks in with a butcher knife to attack me?
[02:50:06.206 --> 02:50:07.887]  This table's going over on them?
[02:50:07.887 --> 02:50:14.073]  I'm gonna, literally, my teeth are gonna... I mean, I'm gonna just literally start baring my teeth and just go completely ape on them.
[02:50:14.073 --> 02:50:15.274]  It's not because I'm even a tough guy.
[02:50:15.274 --> 02:50:16.114]  I'm normal.
[02:50:16.114 --> 02:50:17.215]  You wanna kill me?
[02:50:17.215 --> 02:50:18.837]  How about you die?
[02:50:18.837 --> 02:50:20.839]  And that's what I'm telling the New World Order.
[02:50:20.839 --> 02:50:22.420]  Listen, I see you.
[02:50:22.420 --> 02:50:23.401]  Man, you're ugly.
[02:50:23.401 --> 02:50:24.362]  Man, you stink.
[02:50:24.362 --> 02:50:25.623]  Man, you're evil.
[02:50:25.623 --> 02:50:26.384]  Wow.
[02:50:26.384 --> 02:50:29.086]  If there wasn't a devil before, you've now manifested it.
[02:50:29.086 --> 02:50:29.747]  You're it.
[02:50:29.747 --> 02:50:30.587]  Satan's real.
[02:50:30.587 --> 02:50:31.128]  And you know what?
[02:50:32.509 --> 02:50:35.191]  I look at you, you snot-nosed, demon-eyed maggot.
[02:50:35.191 --> 02:50:38.373]  I'm going to get my hands around your neck with God's help.
[02:50:38.373 --> 02:50:44.918]  And we're going to absolutely, metaphysically twist your head off your little shoulders.
[02:50:44.918 --> 02:50:48.180]  All I know is, I don't want to be around this or a part of it.
[02:50:48.180 --> 02:50:50.382]  And I've got all this earthquake news.
[02:50:50.382 --> 02:50:52.023]  Five major earthquakes in 48 hours.
[02:50:52.023 --> 02:50:54.985]  The seismologists warn catastrophic mega-earthquakes are coming.
[02:50:54.985 --> 02:50:56.326]  Scientists fear the big one is coming.
[02:50:56.326 --> 02:50:59.308]  Four major earthquakes, 48 volcanoes going crazy.
[02:50:59.308 --> 02:50:59.729]  You name it.
[02:51:00.148 --> 02:51:01.908]  Hello, I'm Michael Reagan.

[02:52:10.503 --> 02:52:11.504]  Here's why.
[02:52:11.504 --> 02:52:17.048]  An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the Power Grid has just been written.
[02:52:17.048 --> 02:52:20.932]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies.
[02:52:21.212 --> 02:52:24.475]  But only for a limited time to GCN listeners.
[02:52:24.475 --> 02:52:29.178]  He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[02:52:29.178 --> 02:52:34.963]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book to you.
[02:52:34.963 --> 02:52:35.904]  Why do this?
[02:52:35.904 --> 02:52:39.767]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[02:52:39.767 --> 02:52:41.068]  The answer is simple.
[02:52:41.068 --> 02:52:45.231]  America's power grid is in grave danger and most Americans are clueless.

[02:54:14.756 --> 02:54:18.538]  But I got one.
[02:54:18.538 --> 02:54:21.499]  You're the devil in disguise.
[02:54:21.499 --> 02:54:25.621]  Oh yes you are, devil in disguise.
[02:54:25.621 --> 02:54:28.403]  And that's the thing, the globalists aren't even in disguise.
[02:54:29.634 --> 02:54:36.301]  Look, I'm going to do a whole special report on the volcanoes and the earthquakes and all the craziness.
[02:54:36.301 --> 02:54:40.506]  I want to hit this Russia story that's on Infowars.com.
[02:54:40.506 --> 02:54:42.708]  It's pretty important.
[02:54:42.708 --> 02:54:43.829]  I'll do five minutes the next hour.
[02:54:43.829 --> 02:54:45.651]  The David Knight takes over with our crews.
[02:54:45.651 --> 02:54:47.753]  They're on the ground there in Denver.
[02:54:47.753 --> 02:54:49.695]  That's only coming up here in about ten minutes or so.
[02:54:53.018 --> 02:54:54.778]  This is a listener-supported broadcast.
[02:54:54.778 --> 02:54:55.939]  Everybody knows that.
[02:54:55.939 --> 02:54:57.439]  That's how we fund the operation.
[02:54:57.439 --> 02:55:00.939]  And we sell a lot of really great products.
[02:55:00.939 --> 02:55:08.781]  And you heard me talking to Peter Schiff earlier about how our audience just gets bigger, but expanded funds don't come in.
[02:55:08.781 --> 02:55:09.421]  And we're doing okay.
[02:55:09.421 --> 02:55:13.842]  We can pay our crew and things, but it gets really hard to do more.
[02:55:13.842 --> 02:55:18.782]  And it just gets down to the fact that I want to be able to continue what we're doing and hopefully expand.
[02:55:18.782 --> 02:55:20.743]  And then I know things are probably going to get worse down the road.
[02:55:20.743 --> 02:55:22.183]  So I'm thinking, man, I just want to keep where I'm at.
[02:55:24.013 --> 02:55:26.575]  And so please shop with the good guys.
[02:55:26.575 --> 02:55:27.576]  Plant a garden this year.

[02:56:04.233 --> 02:56:08.496]  That's 45% off retail, $22 for a new truck.
[02:56:08.496 --> 02:56:11.958]  We could eat, I could sell it for 40 and sleep really good at night.
[02:56:11.958 --> 02:56:13.059]  We've got to have profit to operate.
[02:56:13.059 --> 02:56:17.401]  That is, that's like when I sold a little silver for $9.95, it should be $24.
[02:56:17.401 --> 02:56:18.902]  I mean, it's really good.
[02:56:18.902 --> 02:56:19.883]  Try it out for yourself.

[02:58:18.388 --> 02:58:21.950]  It's basically a clone of the site, but it's more geared towards becoming a distributor.
[02:58:21.950 --> 02:58:23.511]  InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:58:24.751 --> 02:58:26.833]  We're all in this together.

[02:58:33.620 --> 02:58:34.561]  A lot of them are.
[02:58:34.561 --> 02:58:35.883]  Support our local affiliates.
[02:58:35.883 --> 02:58:36.884]  4th Hour coming up.

[02:58:50.066 --> 02:58:53.867]  Anthony Gucciardi here with an InfoWars health news update with Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.867 --> 02:58:54.828]  That's right, Anthony.
[02:58:54.828 --> 02:58:57.769]  One of our top-selling products is BrainForce.
[02:58:57.769 --> 02:59:02.090]  It is very affordably priced at retail that we normally discount it.
[02:59:02.090 --> 02:59:11.734]  We've discounted from the discount 25%, but if you count it from its regular price, that's 45% discount for a limited time at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:11.734 --> 02:59:17.376]  There are a lot of brain boosters out there, or what's known as nootropics, but here's what separates BrainForce from breast.
[02:59:17.856 --> 02:59:29.646]  Unlike some energy drinks and supplements, Brain Force uses natural brain activation ingredients like Yerba Mate Extract, Alpha-GPC, L-Theanine, Hyperzine A, Phosphatidylserine, B12, and many others.
[02:59:29.646 --> 02:59:35.050]  Major nutraceutical review sites rave about this formulation, and they also rave about the price.

[02:59:47.040 --> 02:59:48.941]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:03.892 --> 03:00:08.333]  It's our number four kickoff.
[03:00:08.333 --> 03:00:12.755]  Here's some freedom lovers waging war on corruption.
[03:00:12.755 --> 03:00:19.357]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:00:19.357 --> 03:00:20.797]  Oh yeah, it's the front lines, baby.
[03:00:20.797 --> 03:00:24.418]  You can believe it.
[03:00:24.418 --> 03:00:28.020]  Truthfully, most people that fight tyranny aren't going to run into a lot of trouble.
[03:00:28.020 --> 03:00:29.080]  But until you get to this level,
[03:00:32.044 --> 03:00:36.025]  It gets pretty weird.
[03:00:36.025 --> 03:00:40.026]  Man, I wish I could tell people all the stuff.
[03:00:40.026 --> 03:00:40.906]  I wish I could tell you.
[03:00:40.906 --> 03:00:49.767]  But let me tell you, the system, and the guy running it, got a lot of tricks up their sleeve.
[03:00:49.767 --> 03:00:59.009]  But the good news is, there's a real god runs this universe, and he's got a lot more tricks up his sleeve as well.
[03:01:05.307 --> 03:01:10.410]  All my enemies out there that attack, they end up all of them getting a piece of the action.
[03:01:10.410 --> 03:01:14.333]  I just got to sit back and watch it happen.
[03:01:14.333 --> 03:01:23.079]  I'll tell you this though, we're only going to get in a worse position groveling to the globalists.
[03:01:23.079 --> 03:01:25.181]  We got to stand up to them as hardcore as we can.
[03:01:25.181 --> 03:01:28.443]  That is the safest path out of this tyranny.
[03:01:29.890 --> 03:01:31.991]  All right, let me hit some of the other news.
[03:01:31.991 --> 03:01:34.493]  I mentioned this, but I want to get to this right now.
[03:01:34.493 --> 03:01:42.777]  Exclusive Colorado Caucus volunteers, where our folks are going to be on in like five minutes, Rob Dew and others.
[03:01:42.777 --> 03:01:47.980]  Colorado Caucus volunteers, ballot errors hurt Trump delegate candidates, could have violated the state rules.
[03:01:47.980 --> 03:01:49.421]  Well, of course they did.
[03:01:51.360 --> 03:02:06.354]  Volunteers of the Colorado Republican Assembly are coming forward with evidence that indicates that their state delegate selection process was riddled with errors that disadvantaged some Donald Trump supporters who were running to become national delegates.
[03:02:06.354 --> 03:02:09.998]  Well, yeah, they blocked out all the real delegates and then just chose them.
[03:02:09.998 --> 03:02:15.683]  And then Reitbart is looking at this, not from a criminal mindset, you know, trying to look fair.
[03:02:16.744 --> 03:02:20.207]  Saying, oh, and then they just didn't get to get voted for, it was wrong.
[03:02:20.207 --> 03:02:21.088]  No, it was all fixed.
[03:02:21.088 --> 03:02:23.169]  That's how Cruz got all the delegates.
[03:02:23.169 --> 03:02:26.512]  Cruz didn't get all the... Every delegate wasn't for him.
[03:02:26.512 --> 03:02:30.575]  Even if they tried to rig it, you just can't magically have all of them for you.
[03:02:30.575 --> 03:02:32.557]  Canceling the election was rigging number one.
[03:02:32.557 --> 03:02:34.799]  Then they didn't want anybody for him.
[03:02:34.799 --> 03:02:37.421]  They're like, oh, maybe the ballots weren't right.
[03:02:37.421 --> 03:02:39.002]  Oh, think so?
[03:02:39.002 --> 03:02:39.643]  Think so, really?
[03:02:42.728 --> 03:02:48.113]  Ted Cruz took all 34 delegates last week in a process that closed down traditional caucus voting of the public.
[03:02:48.113 --> 03:02:48.334]  Oh!
[03:02:48.334 --> 03:02:49.815]  Closed down traditional voting.
[03:02:49.815 --> 03:02:50.396]  No big deal.
[03:02:52.048 --> 03:02:55.570]  A handful of volunteers spoke to Breitbart News about the process.
[03:02:55.570 --> 03:03:01.094]  I'm the former chairman of the Pueblo County Republican Party and the person who developed the states of national delegates for the Donald Trump team.
[03:03:01.094 --> 03:03:05.476]  The Colorado GOP website was filled with errors posted about the national delegates.
[03:03:05.476 --> 03:03:05.937]  What was it?
[03:03:05.937 --> 03:03:06.257]  Errors?
[03:03:06.257 --> 03:03:07.998]  That's the fog of war to confuse you.
[03:03:07.998 --> 03:03:09.439]  Nancy Mazel told Breitbart News.
[03:03:09.439 --> 03:03:10.980]  Let's get Nancy Mazel on.
[03:03:10.980 --> 03:03:12.481]  Because you're going to see it in more states.
[03:03:12.481 --> 03:03:17.484]  Mazel took a photograph of a ballot, and we covered this last week on a YouTube video, or this Monday.
[03:03:18.064 --> 03:03:18.884]  Congressional District 7.
[03:03:18.884 --> 03:03:20.225]  See, I'm not mad at my reporters.
[03:03:20.225 --> 03:03:21.866]  I don't have as big a staff as Breitbart.
[03:03:21.866 --> 03:03:23.546]  I want them to do a story on this.
[03:03:23.546 --> 03:03:32.590]  Mizzell, because we have the video, took a photograph of the ballot in Congressional District 7 that included only the ballot numbers of delegate candidates, not the names and candidates required by the state bylaws.
[03:03:32.590 --> 03:03:34.771]  And it just goes on from there.
[03:03:34.771 --> 03:03:36.232]  I mean, you talk about hanky-panky.
[03:03:36.232 --> 03:03:37.112]  This is it.
[03:03:41.141 --> 03:03:42.422]  Now let's continue here.
[03:03:42.422 --> 03:03:50.308]  Here is another article that Steve Watson did dealing with Hitler, excuse me, Hillary Clinton.
[03:03:50.308 --> 03:03:53.570]  I actually did say Hitler wrong there, that wasn't a joke.
[03:03:53.570 --> 03:03:58.353]  Phone transcript proves Hillary lied about Benghazi attack.
[03:03:58.353 --> 03:04:01.876]  Clinton told Egyptian Prime Minister, we know the attack in Libya has nothing to do with the film.
[03:04:03.228 --> 03:04:11.535]  A transcript of the telephone conversation released by the State Department proves once and for all that Hillary Clinton knowingly lied about the Benghazi attacks in the American diplomatic compound.
[03:04:11.535 --> 03:04:21.824]  The transcript obtained by a four-year request by Judicial Watch, they do such a good job, details a call immediately after the attack between then-Secretary of State and then-Egyptian Prime Minister.
[03:04:21.824 --> 03:04:25.207]  We know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film, Clinton told him.
[03:04:25.207 --> 03:04:27.089]  It was a planned attack, not a protest.
[03:04:29.008 --> 03:04:34.776]  The Prime Minister went on, you're not kidding, based on the information we saw, we believe that group had claimed responsibility for this affiliate with Al-Qaeda.
[03:04:34.776 --> 03:04:37.260]  Well, two, they had running security in the area, it was all staged.
[03:04:37.260 --> 03:04:39.543]  That's just another lie she got caught in.
[03:04:39.543 --> 03:04:40.164]  Another lie.
[03:04:41.735 --> 03:04:48.799]  Alright, um, he's getting suited up, he's loaded for bear, and nothing on earth's gonna stop him!
[03:04:48.799 --> 03:04:54.401]  David Knight coming out of the bullpen in T-minus three minutes, seven seconds.
[03:04:54.401 --> 03:04:55.622]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:04:55.622 --> 03:04:58.003]  Join us in the epic fight for human liberty.
[03:04:58.003 --> 03:04:59.244]  Join us in the info war.
[03:05:00.074 --> 03:05:08.296]  A seismologist warns that catastrophic mega-earthquakes are on their way after five major earthquakes took place in the last 48 hours.
[03:05:08.296 --> 03:05:19.778]  Seismologist Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado has made headlines all over the world by warning that current conditions might trigger at least four earthquakes greater than 8.0 in magnitude.
[03:05:19.778 --> 03:05:26.620]  If his projections are accurate, our planet could be on the precipice of a wave of natural disasters unlike anything that any of us have witnessed before.
[03:05:26.840 --> 03:05:32.749]  A single magnitude 8.0 earthquake in a populated area would be a disaster of historic proportions.
[03:05:32.749 --> 03:05:33.770]  But four of them?
[03:05:33.770 --> 03:05:35.893]  That would be a complete and utter nightmare.
[03:05:35.893 --> 03:05:41.341]  And according to Volcano Discovery, 38 volcanoes around the globe are erupting right now.
[03:05:41.341 --> 03:05:42.303]  Michael Snyder asks,
[03:05:42.523 --> 03:05:43.685]  Why is this happening?
[03:05:43.685 --> 03:05:47.570]  Why is the crust of the earth shaking so violently all of a sudden?
[03:05:47.570 --> 03:05:53.178]  In Matthew 24, Jesus warned us that there would be earthquakes in diverse places just prior to his return.
[03:05:53.178 --> 03:05:57.023]  Are we truly in the times the Bible refers to as the last days?

[03:07:15.765 --> 03:07:23.310]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip, because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[03:07:23.690 --> 03:07:28.774]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[03:07:28.774 --> 03:07:34.879]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[03:07:34.879 --> 03:07:42.685]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[03:07:42.685 --> 03:07:49.550]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[03:07:49.550 --> 03:07:50.691]  10% off on auto ship.
[03:07:50.831 --> 03:07:53.272]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:53.272 --> 03:07:55.252]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[03:07:55.252 --> 03:08:09.757]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[03:08:09.757 --> 03:08:13.558]  They just tell us what they think we ought to know.
[03:08:20.513 --> 03:08:23.715]  It's April 15th, you know what that means.
[03:08:23.715 --> 03:08:24.895]  Or do you?
[03:08:24.895 --> 03:08:27.777]  It may not be the day you think it is.
[03:08:27.777 --> 03:08:29.078]  Power of power, and of course...
[03:08:29.932 --> 03:08:32.613]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[03:08:32.613 --> 03:08:38.035]  That's Tower Power, Tax to the Max, one of my favorite songs, especially this time of year.
[03:08:38.035 --> 03:08:39.856]  You know, today is April 15th.
[03:08:39.856 --> 03:08:50.020]  That may be the day you think you have to file your taxes, but in a good example of how even the tax deadline is convoluted and loaded with exceptions, listen to this.
[03:08:50.020 --> 03:08:51.901]  I wasn't even aware of this until today myself.
[03:08:52.461 --> 03:08:56.484]  Tax Day will not be today, but will be Monday, April the 18th.
[03:08:56.484 --> 03:08:59.667]  Traditionally, it's on April the 15th, unless it falls on a weekend.
[03:08:59.667 --> 03:09:05.531]  However, in the District of Columbia, they are celebrating Emancipation Day.
[03:09:05.531 --> 03:09:09.695]  Now, Emancipation Day falls on Saturday.
[03:09:09.695 --> 03:09:12.877]  You would say, well, why don't they just celebrate it on Monday?
[03:09:12.877 --> 03:09:20.343]  No, no, the law says that if it falls on a weekend, it's observed on the day that is closest, the weekday that is closest to it.
[03:09:20.843 --> 03:09:28.353]  That would mean that since it comes on the 16th, they have to celebrate it on the 15th and not on the 18th.
[03:09:28.353 --> 03:09:29.555]  Oh, okay.
[03:09:29.555 --> 03:09:35.583]  So therefore, they're going to move that because in Washington, D.C., they're celebrating Emancipation Day.
[03:09:35.583 --> 03:09:36.504]  Do you feel emancipated?
[03:09:37.685 --> 03:09:41.387]  You know, I don't feel emancipated with this, but it gets even better, okay?
[03:09:41.387 --> 03:09:52.453]  It gets even better because for those people who are doing returns in Maine or Massachusetts, they get another day because that's the holiday this coming Monday.
[03:09:52.453 --> 03:10:04.080]  The deadline will be April the 19th because they're celebrating Patriots Day, which actually was the move against Concord in Lexington was actually on April the 19th, but they're celebrating it on April the 18th.
[03:10:04.080 --> 03:10:05.561]  How's that for the federal government?
[03:10:06.241 --> 03:10:13.908]  But of course, if you need more time, you can always get Form 4868, and you can fill that out and send that to the appropriate place.
[03:10:13.908 --> 03:10:17.931]  But you need to check the instructions to see where you're going to send that.
[03:10:17.931 --> 03:10:19.192]  Have you had enough?
[03:10:19.192 --> 03:10:20.774]  I've had enough.
[03:10:20.774 --> 03:10:28.220]  You know, I ran with the Libertarian Party, what was it, about 20 years ago?
[03:10:28.220 --> 03:10:31.663]  20, 20, yeah, 20 years ago exactly.
[03:10:31.663 --> 03:10:32.424]  Ran for Congress.
[03:10:33.663 --> 03:10:36.885]  First thing I said was, let's get rid of the income tax.
[03:10:36.885 --> 03:10:37.645]  Okay?
[03:10:37.645 --> 03:10:45.069]  It was something that Harry Brown, who was running for president at the time, first time, he said, you know, the income tax doesn't fund our government.
[03:10:45.069 --> 03:10:47.110]  It only funds a very small part of the government.
[03:10:47.110 --> 03:10:48.651]  We have other taxes that are there.
[03:10:49.251 --> 03:10:52.074]  We could make other taxes instead of the income tax.
[03:10:52.074 --> 03:10:54.556]  We don't necessarily have to get our taxes through the income tax, right?
[03:10:54.556 --> 03:10:57.839]  We can get it through a flat tax, a sales tax.
[03:10:57.839 --> 03:11:00.701]  But you've got to be careful when they come up with these alternative plans.
[03:11:00.701 --> 03:11:03.164]  They're typically going to add them and not replace them.
[03:11:03.164 --> 03:11:04.785]  I understand that, okay?
[03:11:04.785 --> 03:11:10.710]  But still, if you just cut out the income tax, cut out the IRS, what would happen to our country?
[03:11:11.671 --> 03:11:22.188]  Yeah, you would really only have to go back, and it varies, we've looked at the numbers, and you only have to go back typically, especially because the government is growing so quickly, you typically only have to go back about six or seven years.
[03:11:23.248 --> 03:11:25.569]  And that's how fast our government is growing.
[03:11:25.569 --> 03:11:29.471]  And that's how little the income tax contributes to the operation of our government.
[03:11:29.471 --> 03:11:35.574]  So, could you live with a government that was the size it was six or seven years ago in order to get rid of the income tax?
[03:11:35.574 --> 03:11:37.555]  Now is the time to think about that.
[03:11:37.555 --> 03:11:39.256]  You really should think about that.
[03:11:39.256 --> 03:11:41.917]  And, you know, let me just throw this in as a historical aside.
[03:11:41.917 --> 03:11:44.979]  I don't want to get too far off of the track here, but Emancipation Day,
[03:11:45.639 --> 03:11:46.460]  Okay, great.
[03:11:46.460 --> 03:11:52.946]  Ending slavery was a great thing, but Emancipation Proclamation didn't free a single slave.
[03:11:52.946 --> 03:11:54.147]  Look it up.
[03:11:54.147 --> 03:12:02.836]  Abraham Lincoln was very careful to only free the slaves in the states that were still under the Confederate States of America.
[03:12:02.836 --> 03:12:07.000]  All the slaves that were in states that he controlled, he did not free.
[03:12:08.086 --> 03:12:16.656]  Which is why Ulysses Grant kept his slaves until after the Civil War when they were eliminated by the 14th Amendment.
[03:12:16.656 --> 03:12:22.983]  So Emancipation Day itself is also a fraud and I don't feel very emancipated today as we're looking at the taxes.
[03:12:22.983 --> 03:12:24.464]  Now, look at this article here.
[03:12:24.464 --> 03:12:28.268]  Insurers are warning that losses from Obamacare are unsustainable.
[03:12:29.042 --> 03:12:36.568]  And I think that's interesting because, you know, Justice Roberts in the Supreme Court told us that Obamacare isn't an unconstitutional mandate.
[03:12:36.568 --> 03:12:38.650]  No, it's a tax!
[03:12:38.650 --> 03:12:39.571]  Yeah, isn't it?
[03:12:39.571 --> 03:12:41.673]  It's a tax, like Admiral Ackbar.
[03:12:41.673 --> 03:12:42.794]  It's a tax!
[03:12:42.794 --> 03:12:44.195]  It's a tax, it's a tax.
[03:12:44.195 --> 03:12:49.299]  Well, that tax, which is an onerous part of doing your income tax.
[03:12:50.555 --> 03:12:52.557]  It's also something that is not working out very well.
[03:12:52.557 --> 03:13:04.946]  Health insurance companies are amplifying their warning about the financial sustainability of the Obamacare marketplace as they seek approval for premium increases next year in the Affordable Care Act.
[03:13:04.946 --> 03:13:07.308]  Now, gotta have even more increases.
[03:13:07.308 --> 03:13:11.451]  We had a slew of increases at the onset, but it still isn't working.
[03:13:11.451 --> 03:13:16.875]  They need even more with all of the mandates, because it's not just mandated that you buy it.
[03:13:17.455 --> 03:13:25.606]  It's also mandated that celibate nuns have to get birth control insurance, okay, or abortion insurance.
[03:13:25.606 --> 03:13:30.191]  Insurance say, insurers say that they're losing money on their Obamacare plans at a rapid rate.
[03:13:30.191 --> 03:13:32.975]  Some have begun to talk about dropping out of the marketplace altogether.
[03:13:32.975 --> 03:13:34.217]  This is a story from The Hill.
[03:13:34.917 --> 03:13:41.802]  Something has to give, says an expert on the health law at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said either insurers will drop out or they will raise premiums.
[03:13:41.802 --> 03:13:51.630]  In the short term, there is a growing likelihood that insurers will push for substantial premium increases, creating a political problem for Democrats in an election year.
[03:13:51.630 --> 03:13:52.550]  You think?
[03:13:52.550 --> 03:13:55.072]  Yeah, maybe, maybe it will.
[03:13:55.072 --> 03:14:02.418]  We have an amazing admission from Google that is buried in a patent for self-driving cars.
[03:14:03.078 --> 03:14:04.239]  We'll get to that in just a minute.
[03:14:04.239 --> 03:14:17.414]  Before I do, I want to comment, because Alex has played several times, this clip going back and forth of Barbara Boxer browbeating a guy who is speaking against man-made climate change.
[03:14:18.607 --> 03:14:22.830]  And I thought it was interesting in that clip, she says to one guy, what are you?
[03:14:22.830 --> 03:14:23.671]  And he goes, well, I'm a philosopher.
[03:14:23.671 --> 03:14:24.812]  Well, why are we talking to you?
[03:14:24.812 --> 03:14:26.753]  We need to have scientists here.
[03:14:26.753 --> 03:14:29.435]  Well, you know, Barbara Boxer wants to play the credentials game.
[03:14:29.435 --> 03:14:30.856]  Barbara Boxer is not a scientist.
[03:14:30.856 --> 03:14:31.577]  She's got a B.S.
[03:14:31.577 --> 03:14:32.358]  in economics.
[03:14:32.358 --> 03:14:35.440]  She worked as a stockbroker and then as a journalist.
[03:14:35.440 --> 03:14:38.602]  Bill Nye, the science guy, OK, he's kind of a science guy.
[03:14:38.602 --> 03:14:40.684]  He's got an engineering degree like me.
[03:14:40.684 --> 03:14:41.364]  He's a master.
[03:14:41.364 --> 03:14:43.126]  He's got a mechanical engineering degree.
[03:14:43.126 --> 03:14:44.067]  But, you know, the problem is
[03:14:45.268 --> 03:14:51.933]  I don't think you learn too much because one of the first things they teach you in engineering is that you got to know what your tolerances are.
[03:14:52.691 --> 03:14:53.851]  Bill?
[03:14:53.851 --> 03:14:54.592]  Okay.
[03:14:54.592 --> 03:15:10.076]  So, yeah, we can look at it and we can say the obvious thing is that the sun has the biggest effect on our climate, but even when they go back and play with these numbers and they say the Earth is going to melt if we've got a two degree or a one degree increase in temperature.
[03:15:10.076 --> 03:15:17.159]  Yeah, I'm with John Coleman, the guy that Alex has interviewed multiple times, the guy who was the founder of the Weather Channel.
[03:15:17.159 --> 03:15:20.520]  This is a guy who understands tolerances.
[03:15:22.260 --> 03:15:28.422]  This is a guy who grew up looking at the weather, studying the weather, trying to predict the weather.
[03:15:28.422 --> 03:15:33.484]  He knows you're not going to be able to predict the weather, especially with these untested models.
[03:15:33.484 --> 03:15:37.005]  10 years, 50 years, decades out, you're not going to be able to predict it that way.
[03:15:37.005 --> 03:15:38.526]  It's absolute total nonsense.
[03:15:38.526 --> 03:15:48.129]  And to say that you're going to have the sky fall in, if there's a change in one degree, you don't have base measurements that fall within that tolerance.
[03:15:49.144 --> 03:15:50.184]  He said over and over again.
[03:15:50.184 --> 03:15:52.845]  He said, look, when I was growing up, we had these thermometers.
[03:15:52.845 --> 03:15:53.566]  You may have seen them.
[03:15:53.566 --> 03:15:55.566]  You know, they didn't have the nice little digital readouts.
[03:15:55.566 --> 03:15:58.648]  You get a digital readout, you think it is 100% accurate.
[03:15:58.648 --> 03:15:59.908]  It's not.
[03:15:59.908 --> 03:16:00.528]  It's not.
[03:16:00.528 --> 03:16:11.352]  When people stop using analog devices like slide rules and thermometers with mercury in it, they seem to lose their understanding of what the tolerances are on these devices.
[03:16:11.352 --> 03:16:15.354]  So when you've got something that's a mercury thermometer,
[03:16:16.417 --> 03:16:16.978]  You understand?
[03:16:16.978 --> 03:16:18.659]  You've got parallax air with it.
[03:16:18.659 --> 03:16:22.522]  You've also got air that can be introduced based on where you're doing the temperature measurements.
[03:16:22.522 --> 03:16:24.324]  And of course, they rig that as well.
[03:16:24.324 --> 03:16:35.974]  You can get a very different measurement if you're measuring out in the countryside in a forest than if you're measuring in the city or on an airport tarmac, which is where they put a lot of these in.
[03:16:35.974 --> 03:16:39.337]  So, yeah, Bill Nye, if he is a scientist, maybe he's not a scientist.
[03:16:39.337 --> 03:16:40.278]  I ought to put that disclaimer.
[03:16:40.278 --> 03:16:42.600]  Remember he had, it was Robert Young.
[03:16:43.331 --> 03:16:52.114]  The guy who played Marcus Welby, M.D., and he started cutting ads for Big Pharma, and he said, uh, I'm not a doctor, actually, I just play one on television.
[03:16:52.114 --> 03:16:58.037]  Well, Bill Nye should have that same disclaimer, especially because even if he's an engineer, he doesn't know anything about tolerances.
[03:16:58.037 --> 03:17:03.839]  But, getting back to the irony of this, Barbara Boxer, the irony of her coming down on somebody's credentials,
[03:17:04.699 --> 03:17:06.360]  Because they say they're a philosopher.
[03:17:06.360 --> 03:17:21.849]  And then the irony of her saying to this priest who's trying to explain something to her about the Pope doesn't have authority to speak as a scientist after she's just dressed this other guy down as being a philosopher and having no authority to talk on the issue.
[03:17:22.529 --> 03:17:28.814]  Then, she gets on this priest by saying, well, don't you follow the Pope?
[03:17:28.814 --> 03:17:29.815]  Don't you care what the Pope says?
[03:17:29.815 --> 03:17:33.418]  And it's like, hey lady, the Pope is not a scientist either.
[03:17:33.418 --> 03:17:35.199]  Neither are you!
[03:17:35.199 --> 03:17:37.201]  And so she says, well, you disagree with the Pope.
[03:17:37.201 --> 03:17:38.702]  I think you ought to talk with Reverend Wilson.
[03:17:38.702 --> 03:17:42.685]  He goes, well, by the way, he is not a scientist either.
[03:17:42.685 --> 03:17:50.391]  So, when we look at science, and when we look at where this is going, let's take a look at what Google is saying in this amazing admission, I think.
[03:17:50.391 --> 03:17:51.071]  This is a patent.
[03:17:51.912 --> 03:17:56.053]  And the way it was put out by Daily Mail I thought was very amusing.
[03:17:56.053 --> 03:17:59.294]  The headline from Daily Mail sounds like they really are on to something.
[03:17:59.294 --> 03:18:05.055]  It says, Google's self-driving cars may soon predict what drivers are going to do next.
[03:18:05.055 --> 03:18:05.955]  Wow!
[03:18:05.955 --> 03:18:10.496]  Wow, this is like the, what is this, like a pre-crime data analysis or something?
[03:18:10.496 --> 03:18:13.097]  They jacked into your mind, they're going to know where you're going to go?
[03:18:13.097 --> 03:18:13.797]  No.
[03:18:13.797 --> 03:18:19.098]  Actually, they're coming up with a patent to reveal plans where censors will be able to
[03:18:20.018 --> 03:18:22.520]  Look at your turn signals!
[03:18:22.520 --> 03:18:23.981]  That's the mind reading!
[03:18:23.981 --> 03:18:26.262]  That's the prediction of what drivers are going to do.
[03:18:26.262 --> 03:18:32.607]  These self-driving cars are going to be able to look at your turn signals and predict your actions.
[03:18:32.607 --> 03:18:34.608]  Who would have thought that could happen?
[03:18:34.608 --> 03:18:35.509]  Isn't science amazing?
[03:18:36.539 --> 03:18:37.580]  Stay with us, boys and girls.
[03:18:37.580 --> 03:18:40.223]  It gets more interesting even as we go through this.
[03:18:40.223 --> 03:18:45.268]  They're going to look at turn signals and at braking lights, okay?
[03:18:45.268 --> 03:18:56.219]  Now, the Daily Mail, after being absolutely astonished that this is something that's going to be coming, I looked at this and I go, you mean the self-driving cars can't look at brake lights?
[03:18:56.219 --> 03:18:58.301]  They can't look at turn signals now?
[03:18:59.595 --> 03:19:01.697]  Why do they have them on the road?
[03:19:01.697 --> 03:19:11.904]  Maybe this explains why they've been involved in so many accidents at a rate that is an order of magnitude more than a human driver would have.
[03:19:11.904 --> 03:19:13.825]  But of course they bring a hit in the back.
[03:19:13.825 --> 03:19:16.507]  Okay, so it's never their fault legally.
[03:19:16.507 --> 03:19:21.190]  Except when they just turned into the school bus or the, it wasn't a school bus, it was a public bus.
[03:19:22.222 --> 03:19:27.026]  That they actually kind of sort of admitted to being at fault with.
[03:19:27.026 --> 03:19:36.072]  But I tell you, if they can't read the brake signals, then that may explain why they have so many accidents.
[03:19:36.072 --> 03:19:43.938]  Because it's going to be a little bit late in terms of reacting to this, so they're going to slam on the brakes and somebody's going to slam into them.
[03:19:43.938 --> 03:19:49.082]  They say details of this engineering patent filed by Google with this autonomous vehicles have not
[03:19:49.462 --> 03:19:54.213]  They haven't come out yet in full, and they've got a full engineering drawing there of the sensors that are going to be there.
[03:19:54.213 --> 03:19:55.355]  Isn't that amazing?
[03:19:55.355 --> 03:19:55.756]  Stay with us.
[03:19:55.756 --> 03:19:58.883]  We're going to have more amazing science news when we come back.
[03:20:03.240 --> 03:20:08.026]  Hey, I rode the elevator with you, but I don't work on the upper floors.
[03:20:08.026 --> 03:20:14.895]  I just want to squeeze in there right next to you, so the RFID scanner in my pocket can capture all your personal information.

[03:20:18.399 --> 03:20:21.323]  So your identity is now my identity.
[03:20:21.323 --> 03:20:21.783]  Going up.
[03:20:22.711 --> 03:20:30.675]  So am I. For over 10 years, ID Stronghold has pioneered RFID-blocking wallets and ID badge holders for consumers, the U.S.
[03:20:30.675 --> 03:20:33.957]  military, and even the Executive Office of the President.
[03:20:33.957 --> 03:20:36.098]  Shouldn't you be protected too?
[03:20:36.098 --> 03:20:41.081]  ID Stronghold wallets cost about the same as wallets in most stores, but give you extra protection.
[03:20:41.081 --> 03:20:44.103]  I'm Wal Augustinowitz, founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.

[03:21:48.849 --> 03:21:50.670]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[03:21:50.670 --> 03:21:52.310]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[03:21:52.310 --> 03:21:55.131]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[03:21:55.131 --> 03:21:57.431]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[03:21:57.431 --> 03:22:01.932]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[03:22:09.974 --> 03:22:11.395]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[03:22:17.418 --> 03:22:21.602]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[03:22:21.602 --> 03:22:27.808]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[03:22:27.808 --> 03:22:29.549]  How is this even possible?
[03:22:29.549 --> 03:22:36.856]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[03:22:37.096 --> 03:22:45.063]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[03:22:45.063 --> 03:22:49.426]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[03:22:49.426 --> 03:22:58.214]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[03:22:58.214 --> 03:22:59.775]  But you must act fast.
[03:22:59.775 --> 03:23:04.319]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard, our supply is extremely limited right now.
[03:23:04.599 --> 03:23:08.746]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[03:23:08.746 --> 03:23:10.548]  That's Greens75.com.

[03:23:16.837 --> 03:23:18.597]  Hello, I'm Michael Reagan.
[03:23:18.597 --> 03:23:25.979]  My father, President Ronald Reagan, believed so strongly in gold that in 1985, he changed gold ownership forever.
[03:23:25.979 --> 03:23:31.720]  Today, our national debt is spiraling out of control, but gold coins could be the answer.
[03:23:31.720 --> 03:23:41.101]  Call 1-866-525-GOLD or go online to usmoneyreserve.com to get new, never-before-released information about gold.
[03:23:41.101 --> 03:23:41.681]  From the U.S.
[03:23:41.681 --> 03:23:42.961]  Money Reserve, call 1-866-525-GOLD.
[03:23:46.702 --> 03:23:50.304]  A good stove is at the top of the list for any serious survivalist.

[03:23:58.929 --> 03:24:00.870]  The EmberLit line of stoves.
[03:24:12.641 --> 03:24:14.022]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:14.022 --> 03:24:17.285]  I'm David Knight, and we're going to be joining our reporters in Denver.
[03:24:17.285 --> 03:24:22.568]  Of course, there's going to be a protest coming up at 3 o'clock, I think it's Mountain Time.
[03:24:22.568 --> 03:24:32.635]  Okay, so it's not going to be happening at the time we connect with them, but they're going to be there at the steps of the White House, White House, the Capitol Building in Colorado, in Denver, Colorado.
[03:24:32.635 --> 03:24:35.056]  If you want to go to that, it's going to be 3 p.m.
[03:24:35.056 --> 03:24:35.617]  Mountain Time.
[03:24:35.617 --> 03:24:39.279]  That's the west steps of the Colorado State Capitol in Denver, Colorado.
[03:24:39.279 --> 03:24:40.360]  That is a protest
[03:24:41.360 --> 03:24:49.423]  Of the disenfranchisement of the GOP voters in the so-called primary that they had, or the caucus, or I don't know what you call that.
[03:24:49.423 --> 03:24:53.244]  I guess it's not an election, it's the selection that they had.
[03:24:53.244 --> 03:24:57.026]  And we're going to talk to them about what happened last night in New York as well.
[03:24:57.026 --> 03:25:02.808]  I want to get back to the amazing technology news here, but before I do we've got an amazing special.
[03:25:03.328 --> 03:25:11.134]  We have 25% off, an additional 25% off of our sale price of BrainForce at Infowarriorslife.com.
[03:25:11.134 --> 03:25:14.956]  That totals up to 45% off of the retail price.
[03:25:14.956 --> 03:25:18.639]  That's an unprecedented special that we have on BrainForce.
[03:25:18.639 --> 03:25:25.004]  Get something that helps you to focus your thoughts without making you jittery, without keeping you up at night.
[03:25:25.004 --> 03:25:30.527]  BrainForce uses natural brain activation ingredients like Yerba Mate extract and Alpha GPC.
[03:25:31.488 --> 03:25:35.633]  Some ingredients in Brain Force are prescription only in Europe.
[03:25:35.633 --> 03:25:40.239]  And of course we have hundreds of five-star reviews that you can read for yourself at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:25:40.239 --> 03:25:42.542]  Again, an unprecedented special for Brain Force.
[03:25:42.542 --> 03:25:46.246]  25% off of our sale price, 45% off of the retail price at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:25:51.272 --> 03:26:02.901]  I was just talking about the self-driving cars and the fact that they're about to get even smarter because they're going to be able to recognize brake lights and turn signals.
[03:26:02.901 --> 03:26:08.686]  And it's amazing when you look at the engineering diagrams here for their patent where they're going to do this.
[03:26:08.686 --> 03:26:10.327]  They're going to do this, folks.
[03:26:10.327 --> 03:26:13.369]  These cars cannot currently recognize
[03:26:14.170 --> 03:26:18.793]  Brake lights and turn signals, which explains a lot in their driving record.
[03:26:18.793 --> 03:26:20.474]  But look at how complicated this is.
[03:26:20.474 --> 03:26:22.595]  They've got all these devices all over this thing.
[03:26:22.595 --> 03:26:25.316]  It's like, you know, you have a pair of eyes.
[03:26:25.316 --> 03:26:31.340]  And I guarantee you, it's going to be a long time before this thing can predict better than you can what's going on in the road.
[03:26:31.340 --> 03:26:35.782]  They say it's going to enable these driverless cars to anticipate the movements on the roads.
[03:26:35.782 --> 03:26:37.183]  Well, kind of, sort of.
[03:26:37.183 --> 03:26:40.325]  There's going to be a lot of other issues involved, too, because there's more than
[03:26:40.925 --> 03:26:42.407]  Just brake lights and turn signals.
[03:26:42.407 --> 03:26:46.653]  If you've been driving and you're still alive, you understand that, okay?
[03:26:46.653 --> 03:26:57.327]  They say earlier this week, engineers and safety advocates warned self-driving cars are more likely to hinder than to help public safety because of unsolved technical issues.
[03:26:57.327 --> 03:26:57.647]  You think?
[03:26:58.268 --> 03:27:02.789]  Now we see they're starting to work on a patent to recognize turn signals.
[03:27:02.789 --> 03:27:06.469]  But of course, they also point out in the same article from Daily Mail, Google is pushing U.S.
[03:27:06.469 --> 03:27:14.471]  Congress to give the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration new powers to grant it special expedited permission.
[03:27:14.471 --> 03:27:17.911]  Now these are exceptions to safety rules, okay?
[03:27:17.911 --> 03:27:26.253]  They keep telling us, we're going to end all traffic accidents, nobody's going to die on the roads, and yet we need to have the federal government
[03:27:26.893 --> 03:27:34.557]  Exercise its authority to preempt the powers of the state and local communities to protect their people and waive all the safety regulations.
[03:27:34.557 --> 03:27:35.297]  How's that?
[03:27:35.297 --> 03:27:36.198]  Because why?
[03:27:36.198 --> 03:27:38.639]  Because Google wants it for their profits.
[03:27:38.639 --> 03:27:40.500]  But it's not just Google.
[03:27:40.500 --> 03:27:41.881]  The government wants it as well.
[03:27:41.881 --> 03:27:45.683]  Look at this article we've got from Kurt Nemo today on Infowars.com.
[03:27:45.683 --> 03:27:53.507]  The tech community denounces as ludicrous and dangerous a new technically illiterate proposal coming from our senators.
[03:27:54.773 --> 03:28:00.478]  There's a lot of connection between this new proposal and what Google is trying to do.
[03:28:00.478 --> 03:28:04.661]  Because you need to understand that we need to stop calling them self-driving cars.
[03:28:04.661 --> 03:28:08.925]  We need to call them the Internet of Things cars.
[03:28:08.925 --> 03:28:18.173]  Because they're going to have the vehicle infrastructure mandated black boxes on your cars so they can tax and track you and they can control your movement.
[03:28:18.173 --> 03:28:21.796]  That's what they want to do and that's what they're working on to mandate
[03:28:22.256 --> 03:28:22.576]  Thank you.
[03:28:38.314 --> 03:28:39.775]  To the law enforcement.
[03:28:39.775 --> 03:28:57.821]  So now they're going to go the next step and mandate that these companies do it and pull it out into the open and tell everybody that, hey, after all these years of saying, you know, we're not watching you, you're a paranoid conspiracy theorist, if you think that that camera on your monitor is looking at you, you're crazy.
[03:28:57.821 --> 03:29:00.862]  You must be an Alex Jones Show listener.
[03:29:00.862 --> 03:29:04.083]  And now we got the FBI bragging about the fact that he does that.
[03:29:04.986 --> 03:29:05.587]  Okay?
[03:29:05.587 --> 03:29:08.869]  So, the mask is coming off.
[03:29:08.869 --> 03:29:15.695]  They're now bragging about it, they're openly talking about it, and they're going to openly do it and mandate it.
[03:29:15.695 --> 03:29:19.838]  And these corporations want it that way because they don't want the liability.
[03:29:19.838 --> 03:29:21.239]  That's what CISPA was about.
[03:29:21.239 --> 03:29:22.860]  They called it CISA.
[03:29:22.860 --> 03:29:23.181]  Okay?
[03:29:23.181 --> 03:29:24.922]  So that's really what's going on.
[03:29:24.922 --> 03:29:27.924]  This is the way the people in engineering refer to it.
[03:29:27.924 --> 03:29:28.505]  Okay?
[03:29:28.505 --> 03:29:32.388]  They say it basically outlaws end-to-end encryption.
[03:29:32.748 --> 03:29:37.993]  One other person says, this is easily the most ludicrous, dangerous, technically illiterate proposal I've ever seen.
[03:29:37.993 --> 03:29:43.298]  A computer security consultant said, this is a work of complete ignorance.
[03:29:43.298 --> 03:29:48.664]  It is a work of Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, who say no one should be above the law.
[03:29:48.664 --> 03:29:50.205]  Well, we're on the march.
[03:29:50.205 --> 03:29:50.726]  Stay with us.
[03:29:50.726 --> 03:29:53.268]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.268 --> 03:29:55.951]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.180 --> 03:30:06.082]  A Connecticut judge has placed herself above the Constitution and above an explicit congressional law.
[03:30:06.082 --> 03:30:14.004]  Judge Barbara Bellis has ruled that Sandy Hook families can sue gun manufacturers Remington, Bushmaster, and others.
[03:30:14.004 --> 03:30:18.805]  But Congress has already explicitly protected firearm manufacturers from liability.
[03:30:19.065 --> 03:30:34.550]  In the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which says they will not be held liable for, quote, the harm caused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse firearm products or ammunition products that function as designed and intended.
[03:30:34.550 --> 03:30:48.674]  The act goes on to explain to people with an anti-gun agenda like Judge Bellis that, quote, the possibility of imposing liability on an entire industry for harm that is solely caused by others is an abuse of the legal system, unquote.
[03:30:48.874 --> 03:30:49.594]  What's next?
[03:30:49.594 --> 03:30:53.597]  Holding Ford liable for a drunk driver killing someone with the car that they made?
[03:30:53.597 --> 03:30:57.479]  If Hillary Clinton has her way, that's what they will do to gun manufacturers.
[03:30:57.479 --> 03:30:59.921]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:30:59.921 --> 03:31:03.423]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:03.423 --> 03:31:11.668]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:31:11.668 --> 03:31:16.691]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[03:33:14.022 --> 03:33:20.329]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:22.642 --> 03:33:33.252]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, and we're going to be joining our reporters in Denver, Rob Due and Joe Biggs and my son are there covering the protest.
[03:33:33.252 --> 03:33:35.034]  It's going to be starting at 3 p.m.
[03:33:35.034 --> 03:33:39.678]  Mountain Standard Time at the West Steps of the Colorado State Capitol building in Denver, Colorado.
[03:33:39.678 --> 03:33:44.944]  Of course, they're going to be protesting what happened in the so-called primary that they had there.
[03:33:45.604 --> 03:33:47.605]  We're going to be going to them live in just a moment.
[03:33:47.605 --> 03:33:53.087]  As we were on break, Kit Daniels came in and handed me a story that just went up on InfoWars.com.
[03:33:53.087 --> 03:33:54.568]  Agenda 21.
[03:33:54.568 --> 03:33:59.230]  Developers are planning a car-free 30-story condo in Austin.
[03:33:59.230 --> 03:33:59.990]  See, here it is.
[03:33:59.990 --> 03:34:01.471]  It's all part of Agenda 21.
[03:34:01.471 --> 03:34:07.654]  If you're going to control people's movements, if you're going to track their movements, if you're going to concentrate people into the cities,
[03:34:08.502 --> 03:34:11.187]  You need to make it car-free.
[03:34:11.187 --> 03:34:12.911]  You need to be able to control their movements.
[03:34:12.911 --> 03:34:20.366]  And of course, this is, folks, you need to understand that it is nothing less than all-out war against our freedom.
[03:34:21.417 --> 03:34:24.958]  One of the first things you do is you control the movements of people.
[03:34:24.958 --> 03:34:27.779]  You put in additional ways to tax them.
[03:34:27.779 --> 03:34:30.059]  Now, we're going to talk to our reporters in Denver.
[03:34:30.059 --> 03:34:33.620]  Before we do, I wanted to give you a couple of political stories that are out here.
[03:34:33.620 --> 03:34:40.942]  This is from The Hill, a report that almost half of all Super PAC money came from just 50 donors.
[03:34:40.942 --> 03:34:42.182]  Now, that explains a lot, doesn't it?
[03:34:42.702 --> 03:34:55.371]  Doesn't that explain the selection of delegates, the careful screening of people that are going to be allowed to participate in this convoluted and very opaque process that they had there?
[03:34:55.371 --> 03:34:58.073]  It was absolutely a ridiculous process if you take a look at it.
[03:34:58.573 --> 03:35:25.536]  Having people stand up and give a 10-minute statement to say never Trump or my number is such-and-such vote for me and they didn't put people's names on the ballot which is one of the many things that this article that we have Patrick Halley of Breitbart Colorado caucus volunteers are saying ballot errors hurt Trump delegate candidates could have violated state rules they say that it's going to be significant enough that not only does it violate Republican
[03:35:26.488 --> 03:35:29.470]  Party rules, but they believe it's going to be challenged legally.
[03:35:29.470 --> 03:35:30.950]  Things like this, for example.
[03:35:30.950 --> 03:35:36.413]  The ballot shall include the presidential candidate each candidate for national delegate is pledged to support.
[03:35:36.413 --> 03:35:38.254]  Oh, that wasn't there, was it?
[03:35:38.254 --> 03:35:40.255]  It also didn't put their names there, either.
[03:35:40.255 --> 03:35:41.035]  Okay?
[03:35:41.035 --> 03:35:45.438]  And, of course, it just put numbers there, but then some people didn't get their numbers put there.
[03:35:45.438 --> 03:35:47.659]  They got some numbers listed twice.
[03:35:47.659 --> 03:35:49.140]  Others were omitted.
[03:35:49.140 --> 03:35:51.481]  So it's a very, very convoluted system.
[03:35:51.481 --> 03:35:53.502]  But here's the bottom line, folks.
[03:35:54.142 --> 03:35:58.243]  It's like 50 people are spending most of the money on the election.
[03:35:58.243 --> 03:36:02.543]  50 donors are half of all the SuperPAC money.
[03:36:02.543 --> 03:36:05.124]  This is according to the Washington Post.
[03:36:05.124 --> 03:36:15.326]  50 donors and their families, and they say some of the biggest contributors so far have been hedge fund manager Tom Steyer, who is fighting climate change.
[03:36:15.326 --> 03:36:22.407]  He has put in 17 million dollars into a SuperPAC that supports candidates that are fighting climate change.
[03:36:23.407 --> 03:36:28.229]  Uh, that are trying to set up a world governance based on carbon taxes.
[03:36:28.229 --> 03:36:33.930]  Steyer has pledged to spend more than the 74 million dollars he gave during the 2014 elections.
[03:36:33.930 --> 03:36:37.291]  He gave 74 million dollars.
[03:36:37.291 --> 03:36:40.452]  Now, this is an investment, folks.
[03:36:40.452 --> 03:36:47.815]  When Karl Rove was talking to, had his, his call, and some people said, hey, it looks like he's softening up to Trump.
[03:36:47.815 --> 03:36:51.536]  What he was doing was he was talking to, and they put it in there, his investors.
[03:36:52.356 --> 03:36:58.799]  As to how they could preserve their candidates in office if Donald Trump were at the top of the ticket.
[03:36:58.799 --> 03:37:00.740]  They are investors.
[03:37:00.740 --> 03:37:06.323]  They are not doing this because they are passionate about preserving individual liberty.
[03:37:06.323 --> 03:37:08.864]  They're not doing this because they're passionate about
[03:37:09.484 --> 03:37:09.765]  I think?
[03:37:24.428 --> 03:37:24.748]  We're good.
[03:37:40.700 --> 03:37:49.128]  And of course, Barbara Boxer, or not Barbara Boxer, it was Bill Nye that was talking about that, saying, you know, Enron was a criminal organization.
[03:37:49.128 --> 03:37:54.213]  We ought to make people who talk about climate change and deny it, we ought to make them criminals as well.
[03:37:54.213 --> 03:37:57.196]  Now also in that, of course, are the big hitters for Ted Cruz.
[03:37:57.196 --> 03:38:03.922]  Other hedge fund managers like Robert Mercer and Paul Singer are also listed in the big donors.
[03:38:03.922 --> 03:38:05.223]  When we look at the delegates,
[03:38:06.204 --> 03:38:09.606]  We've got Ben Carson coming out and defending this.
[03:38:09.606 --> 03:38:11.586]  And I'm going to go to Rob in just a moment.
[03:38:11.586 --> 03:38:14.128]  He asked, why do we have the Electoral College anymore?
[03:38:14.128 --> 03:38:19.910]  And what he was doing was saying, I'm not happy with the way these delegates are being selected.
[03:38:19.910 --> 03:38:20.650]  And I'm not either.
[03:38:20.650 --> 03:38:26.253]  And we've talked about this many times, but there's a reason that we have the Electoral College besides the fact that
[03:38:27.579 --> 03:38:30.442]  It's not just GOP rules, okay?
[03:38:30.442 --> 03:38:31.884]  It's actually in the Constitution.
[03:38:31.884 --> 03:38:35.868]  It's the same reason we have senators and not just representatives.
[03:38:35.868 --> 03:38:37.890]  The representatives are supposed to represent the people.
[03:38:37.890 --> 03:38:40.012]  They're proportional based on population.
[03:38:40.012 --> 03:38:43.116]  The senators are supposed to represent the states.
[03:38:43.116 --> 03:38:43.996]  Why do you have that?
[03:38:45.009 --> 03:38:50.274]  I saw a first-hand example of that in the county that I lived in in North Carolina.
[03:38:50.274 --> 03:38:54.017]  It bordered the university town for the University of North Carolina.
[03:38:54.017 --> 03:39:01.603]  They had a lot of people that moved in and in a high concentration spilled over into this previously rural county that had nothing but farmers in it.
[03:39:02.324 --> 03:39:09.147]  They had had a situation where they had elected representatives to the county government on a regional basis.
[03:39:09.147 --> 03:39:17.231]  But when these people, who were political lefty activists, spilled in from the university town, started moving into that county, they changed the rules.
[03:39:17.231 --> 03:39:18.252]  They said, you know what?
[03:39:18.252 --> 03:39:22.654]  We're just going to elect all the county commissioners at large.
[03:39:22.654 --> 03:39:23.594]  At large.
[03:39:23.594 --> 03:39:25.855]  Guess who got all the county commissioners?
[03:39:25.855 --> 03:39:28.156]  That little enclave of people at the top.
[03:39:28.156 --> 03:39:28.857]  What did they do?
[03:39:29.557 --> 03:39:38.785]  They enacted restrictions so these people who had been there in many cases with their farms for over a hundred years, 150 years, could not do anything with their land.
[03:39:38.785 --> 03:39:49.574]  They couldn't subdivide it, they couldn't sell off a portion of it because these people up in this little corner and this little suburban area were dictating to these people who had been there for many generations.
[03:39:49.574 --> 03:39:50.655]  That's the reason you've got
[03:39:51.355 --> 03:39:52.797]  States having power.
[03:39:52.797 --> 03:39:55.639]  They wanted to divide power and not just give it to the people.
[03:39:55.639 --> 03:39:57.661]  And we didn't want to have just a direct democracy.
[03:39:57.661 --> 03:40:01.765]  So again, Ben Carson's a great guy, but he's really confused about the issue.
[03:40:01.765 --> 03:40:03.447]  It doesn't have anything to do with the Electoral College.
[03:40:03.447 --> 03:40:07.251]  It has to do with the crooked rules of the GOP.
[03:40:07.251 --> 03:40:10.334]  And so now we go to our reporters in Denver, Rob Dew.
[03:40:12.389 --> 03:40:14.771]  Hi David, Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:40:14.771 --> 03:40:25.858]  Just outside of the capital of Colorado, this is the western side, this is where people will be showing up in about an hour and a half to protest the GOP's theft of their caucus.
[03:40:25.858 --> 03:40:35.524]  Basically, the 1 million people in this state did not get to vote and select, I guess, choose a presidential candidate for the Republican Party, and they're pissed.
[03:40:35.524 --> 03:40:36.905]  So, there's at least 500 people
[03:40:38.204 --> 03:40:48.549]  I got interrupted, Rob, because I would say that they have turned the caucus into a carcass, haven't they?
[03:40:48.549 --> 03:40:51.351]  We're looking at the rotting carcass of democracy.
[03:40:51.351 --> 03:40:57.934]  And I just want to point out, you know, we seem to have this fence wall thing coming up.
[03:40:57.934 --> 03:41:00.175]  They have something they're setting up over here.
[03:41:00.175 --> 03:41:00.595]  I don't know what.
[03:41:00.595 --> 03:41:02.576]  It might be a 420 festival.
[03:41:02.576 --> 03:41:03.917]  And look, they put up fences everywhere.
[03:41:05.512 --> 03:41:06.592]  They do believe in fences, don't they?
[03:41:06.592 --> 03:41:10.753]  We need a fence or wall at play to keep people out and keep people in.
[03:41:10.753 --> 03:41:16.534]  This is the kind of stuff we just need on the border.
[03:41:16.534 --> 03:41:18.474]  People are going to be showing up on these steps.
[03:41:18.474 --> 03:41:20.995]  This is the biggest side of the Capitol right here.
[03:41:20.995 --> 03:41:22.355]  All the others are slower.
[03:41:22.355 --> 03:41:23.515]  This has a nice big yard.
[03:41:23.515 --> 03:41:28.436]  There's a spire over here running up the center.
[03:41:28.436 --> 03:41:31.397]  It should be pretty interesting what's going to happen today.
[03:41:32.017 --> 03:41:35.078]  So it's going to be about an hour and a half from right now, is that right?
[03:41:35.078 --> 03:41:35.458]  About an hour?
[03:41:47.660 --> 03:41:48.981]  In full swing at that point.
[03:41:48.981 --> 03:41:49.341]  All right, good.
[03:41:49.341 --> 03:41:51.462]  We're going to have that on the nightly news tonight.
[03:41:51.462 --> 03:41:58.067]  Tell us what happened last night in New York at the, I guess it was the Occupy Wall Street people protesting Trump.
[03:41:58.067 --> 03:41:59.027]  We saw some of the videos.
[03:41:59.027 --> 03:42:03.710]  We saw it got pretty hot and heavy with that one guy who's trying to educate them about the Second Amendment.
[03:42:03.710 --> 03:42:05.231]  They didn't like that.
[03:42:05.231 --> 03:42:06.132]  Yeah, they didn't like that.
[03:42:06.132 --> 03:42:10.674]  He showed up with his orange sandwich board and passing out flyers saying ISIS is here.
[03:42:10.674 --> 03:42:11.575]  You need to be prepared.
[03:42:11.575 --> 03:42:13.556]  You need to know how to fire a gun.
[03:42:13.556 --> 03:42:16.438]  And two ladies started yelling at him at first.
[03:42:17.031 --> 03:42:18.772]  And they were screaming at him, go, go!
[03:42:18.772 --> 03:42:20.853]  And then they started, you know, screaming more things at him.
[03:42:20.853 --> 03:42:24.496]  And then this guy comes up, puts his hands up and just starts bumping him with his chest.
[03:42:24.496 --> 03:42:31.080]  And then another girl, who I think Biggs says she's with Black Lives Matter, grabbed his cards and threw them.
[03:42:31.080 --> 03:42:34.122]  And then they started pushing him and it escalated from there.
[03:42:34.122 --> 03:42:37.504]  But he didn't, I didn't see him attack anybody first at all.
[03:42:37.504 --> 03:42:40.986]  I saw those guys come up and, you know, they don't like those types of voices.
[03:42:40.986 --> 03:42:42.507]  They don't want to hear about the Second Amendment.
[03:42:42.507 --> 03:42:43.848]  They don't want to hear about real freedom.
[03:42:44.088 --> 03:42:44.328]  Yeah.
[03:42:44.328 --> 03:42:50.514]  They want to talk about their fake, canned freedom where nobody's really free, everybody's just stuck in a socialist box.
[03:42:50.514 --> 03:42:53.357]  Well, you know, he's absolutely right.
[03:42:53.357 --> 03:43:01.744]  If there's an ISIS attack there in New York, their Black Lives Matter tactics and getting up and chest bumping these guys isn't going to be very effective, is it, Rob?
[03:43:03.005 --> 03:43:04.668]  No, not very much.
[03:43:04.668 --> 03:43:10.536]  They're going to take one look at that and probably shoot him if that happens with a bunch of ISIS guys.
[03:43:10.536 --> 03:43:11.698]  Biggs, come on in here.
[03:43:11.698 --> 03:43:13.721]  What was your opinion of what we saw last night?
[03:43:13.721 --> 03:43:17.026]  We didn't see, other than that, we didn't see too many other acts of violence.
[03:43:17.026 --> 03:43:18.989]  I know a few protesters got into the hotel.
[03:43:19.850 --> 03:43:21.452]  We weren't actually around for that.
[03:43:21.452 --> 03:43:29.043]  It was a big area that the protests were going on so we were covering a lot of ground and that happened really quick and that was quickly squashed by the police.
[03:43:29.043 --> 03:43:32.929]  Yeah, I mean I was actually standing behind the guy as he was moving forward filming.
[03:43:32.929 --> 03:43:35.773]  I was actually standing there with Jesse Waters, a guy from O'Reilly.
[03:43:36.784 --> 03:43:39.466]  And all of a sudden, we heard screaming, ISIS is here!
[03:43:39.466 --> 03:43:48.451]  And I was looking around, and I see the guy, he's handing out flyers up in the air, and he goes, you need to learn how to protect yourself, that's what the Second Amendment's for, you need to go out, learn how to shoot a gun.
[03:43:48.451 --> 03:43:52.853]  And like you said, these people just started jumping up in his face, kind of pushing him, chest bumping him, all that.
[03:43:52.853 --> 03:44:00.397]  Then one of the top Black Lives Matter girls, she's been to the White House before, she jumps in his face, starts cussing him out, starts pushing him again.
[03:44:00.397 --> 03:44:03.439]  Some other people do, and next thing you know, it just push, push, push.
[03:44:03.439 --> 03:44:05.260]  Someone gets decked, hits the ground.
[03:44:06.080 --> 03:44:09.221]  Well, you guys don't realize that that was all Donald Trump's fault.
[03:44:09.221 --> 03:44:12.622]  You know, like Ted Cruz said, you know, he's provoking all this.
[03:44:12.622 --> 03:44:14.463]  He wasn't the provocateur, I don't think.
[03:44:26.426 --> 03:44:35.574]  Certainly what he was doing was far less than what we've seen the Bernie Sanders people do going to a Trump rally, and they've been far more aggressive, far more in people's faces.
[03:44:35.574 --> 03:44:42.821]  He wasn't doing anything, he's just standing there saying something, and they were the ones who got physical, they were the ones who got aggressive with him in spite of what Ted Cruz would say.
[03:44:42.821 --> 03:44:49.647]  I mean, I felt more safe on the Trump protester side, the pro-Trump guys, than I did in the anti-Trump.
[03:44:49.647 --> 03:44:50.227]  I mean, if you
[03:44:51.360 --> 03:45:04.186]  If your views differ for them in any way, they become violent, they become too verbally, abuse you, scream at you, cuss at you, and then everyone, they're like, get this guy over here, da-da-da, and they all just swarm around you and just start screaming at you.
[03:45:04.186 --> 03:45:05.427]  That's not peaceful.
[03:45:05.427 --> 03:45:11.990]  You know, when you're suppressing people because I have a different viewpoint than you, and you think you can jump in here and like bully people and push them around?
[03:45:11.990 --> 03:45:13.631]  That's completely and totally out of control.
[03:45:13.631 --> 03:45:16.152]  That's not what America is supposed to be.
[03:45:16.152 --> 03:45:18.393]  And it sure as hell is not going to happen under my watch.
[03:45:18.553 --> 03:45:21.095]  Yeah, they were hanging at Donald Trump in effigy.
[03:45:21.095 --> 03:45:26.458]  They had another guy dressed as Donald Trump with a sign saying, you know, you can beat me for this much with a stick.
[03:45:26.458 --> 03:45:32.963]  You know, all kinds of love and happiness coming out from the liberal left over there in Manhattan.
[03:45:32.963 --> 03:45:44.290]  But, you know, other than that, it didn't get... We were at the Trump side when this other black, I guess, Bernie supporter showed up and wanted to know... He got triggered by Make America Great Again because he really was having a problem.
[03:45:44.290 --> 03:45:44.870]  He's wearing a shirt.
[03:45:44.870 --> 03:45:46.291]  He's like, I bet you guys won't punch me.
[03:45:46.291 --> 03:45:47.212]  I bet you won't punch me.
[03:45:47.572 --> 03:45:49.774]  And then the cops came over and they're like, alright, this is enough, man.
[03:45:49.774 --> 03:45:50.895]  You're starting to agonize.
[03:45:50.895 --> 03:45:55.258]  And he goes, alright, I hope I see you guys in the alley without your badge on.
[03:45:55.258 --> 03:46:03.485]  He's like, I'm going to start beating that A. And then starts just like cussing at him, saying he was threatening to jump him in an alleyway if he ever saw him alone.
[03:46:03.485 --> 03:46:03.986]  Out of control.
[03:46:03.986 --> 03:46:05.327]  That's not peaceful.
[03:46:05.327 --> 03:46:07.589]  And the cops were very well reserved.
[03:46:07.589 --> 03:46:11.192]  I can't believe he didn't get arrested for doing that because he was pushing the cops.
[03:46:11.192 --> 03:46:12.092]  He was verbally cussing.
[03:46:12.092 --> 03:46:12.733]  I was threatening him.
[03:46:13.357 --> 03:46:15.818]  And, you know, I didn't see any Trump supporters doing that.
[03:46:15.818 --> 03:46:19.058]  Yeah, that was the thing we noticed when we were in Washington and New York.
[03:46:19.058 --> 03:46:23.099]  I mean, the police there, they're so experienced with all these different demonstrations.
[03:46:23.099 --> 03:46:25.119]  They were pretty chill in New York and D.C.
[03:46:25.119 --> 03:46:29.860]  It was in Pennsylvania where they went totally overboard and crazy.
[03:46:29.860 --> 03:46:32.661]  It wasn't in the big cities like that where they deal with this every day.
[03:46:32.661 --> 03:46:37.662]  Yeah, they actually had a pretty good plan, the way they kept traffic flowing the whole time.
[03:46:39.468 --> 03:46:40.629]  That's one point.
[03:46:40.629 --> 03:46:47.337]  And, you know, they had areas on either side that were gated off somewhere you could stand and somewhere that they wanted you to keep moving.
[03:46:47.337 --> 03:46:51.842]  And I thought, I actually thought they did a really good job with, you know, not much notice.
[03:46:51.842 --> 03:46:54.484]  One thing's interesting, though, people like, oh, this is spontaneous.
[03:46:54.484 --> 03:46:57.628]  No, we were, we were there talking with Anthony yesterday.
[03:46:57.628 --> 03:46:58.329]  Yeah, it was yesterday.
[03:47:00.097 --> 03:47:00.177]  Yeah.
[03:47:18.248 --> 03:47:21.071]  Transphobic, blah, blah, blah, blah, xenophobe.
[03:47:21.071 --> 03:47:22.253]  They couldn't even spell xenophobe.
[03:47:22.253 --> 03:47:24.835]  They didn't even know what it meant, but they used the word.
[03:47:24.835 --> 03:47:26.477]  It's the same thing every time.
[03:47:26.477 --> 03:47:29.981]  Mindless zombies just out there protesting just to get out there.
[03:47:29.981 --> 03:47:30.822]  They have no job.
[03:47:30.822 --> 03:47:35.527]  They sit out there and they complain about not getting work, but they're too lazy to go out and look for a job.
[03:47:35.527 --> 03:47:37.349]  Yeah, there are a lot of communist organizations.
[03:47:38.954 --> 03:47:42.417]  I put a video up called Kami-chan and that, you know, it's just them just sitting there chanting.
[03:47:42.417 --> 03:47:44.239]  They showed up, started chanting.
[03:47:44.239 --> 03:47:48.703]  I ran into a guy with a red star on his cap who was actually, you know, he was at InfoWars.
[03:47:48.703 --> 03:47:50.345]  He was like, InfoWars, I like you guys.
[03:47:50.345 --> 03:47:54.689]  So I started talking to him about, you know, what he thought socialism was and what, you know,
[03:47:55.766 --> 03:47:56.867]  No grasp on reality.
[03:47:56.867 --> 03:48:00.511]  Thinking that socialism is the next evolution after capitalism.
[03:48:00.511 --> 03:48:11.682]  Because once you have this great infrastructure built that you see all around you that capitalism built, well then you just take it for a giant government program to then dole out to just privileged people, the privileged class.
[03:48:12.122 --> 03:48:14.303]  Yeah, we saw how that worked out in Venezuela.
[03:48:14.303 --> 03:48:16.144]  Now they're rationing everything.
[03:48:16.144 --> 03:48:19.426]  They don't have food, electricity, they have no power.
[03:48:19.426 --> 03:48:24.068]  Because he had the kleptocrat there, Hugo Chavez, went in and seized everything.
[03:48:24.068 --> 03:48:29.370]  And he was eventually thrown out even by other socialists and libertarians because he's a kleptocrat.
[03:48:29.370 --> 03:48:31.371]  But that's what happens with it.
[03:48:31.371 --> 03:48:35.093]  Eventually you run out of the things that you stole from other people because you can't produce anything.
[03:48:35.093 --> 03:48:39.795]  You can't even produce your own energy even though they've got more oil than Saudi Arabia.
[03:48:39.795 --> 03:48:40.656]  It's absolutely amazing.
[03:48:40.916 --> 03:48:46.200]  Well, tell us what you're going to be doing tomorrow.
[03:48:46.200 --> 03:48:48.222]  You're going to be going to Portland, Oregon.
[03:48:48.222 --> 03:48:50.143]  There's state students for a Trump meeting.
[03:48:50.143 --> 03:48:50.724]  Tell us about that.
[03:48:51.604 --> 03:48:54.025]  Right, so we're gonna fly tonight to Portland.
[03:48:54.025 --> 03:48:55.805]  We get in around midnight.
[03:48:55.805 --> 03:48:59.226]  This is the most I think I've ever traveled in a 24-hour period.
[03:48:59.226 --> 03:49:01.647]  We flew in here this morning.
[03:49:01.647 --> 03:49:08.669]  Did get much sleep last night because we were, you know, kind of jazzed up what was going on, uploading videos and looking at videos and putting stuff together.
[03:49:08.669 --> 03:49:12.991]  And so, yeah, we're gonna be in Portland tomorrow at 2 p.m.
[03:49:12.991 --> 03:49:14.291]  in Portland time, a specific time.
[03:49:14.291 --> 03:49:17.112]  There's gonna be a pro-Trump rally.
[03:49:17.751 --> 03:49:21.633]  For just some guys that go to Portland State University, that want to have a pro-Trump rally.
[03:49:21.633 --> 03:49:25.235]  This is their second gathering because their first one was shut down by a bunch of protesters.
[03:49:25.235 --> 03:49:26.415]  Very tolerant.
[03:49:26.415 --> 03:49:27.636]  And I guess a bunch of tyrants.
[03:49:27.636 --> 03:49:29.057]  They weren't protesters, they were tyrants.
[03:49:29.057 --> 03:49:38.941]  These were anti-free speech thugs who just don't want anybody else to have an opinion other than their magic opinion, which is only they get to speak.
[03:49:38.941 --> 03:49:39.282]  That's right.
[03:49:39.282 --> 03:49:40.482]  Only they get to have opinions.
[03:49:40.482 --> 03:49:45.004]  Only they get to walk around with their Mecha flags, which is Hispanic Ku Klux Klan.
[03:49:45.004 --> 03:49:46.245]  Look into what Mecha's all about.
[03:49:47.099 --> 03:49:50.180]  Well, we talked to them yesterday, and of course, that should be an interesting thing.
[03:49:50.180 --> 03:50:00.983]  I hope you guys took your brain force with you with all this over-all-nighters that you're doing and traveling from one end of the country, New York yesterday, Portland tomorrow, and today you're in Denver.
[03:50:00.983 --> 03:50:02.263]  You guys are working really hard.
[03:50:02.263 --> 03:50:03.583]  I hope you do have some brain force there.
[03:50:03.583 --> 03:50:08.604]  If you don't, it's 45% off, Rob, off the retail price at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:50:11.085 --> 03:50:12.006]  There you go.
[03:50:12.006 --> 03:50:12.186]  Okay.
[03:50:12.186 --> 03:50:13.167]  All right, guys.
[03:50:13.167 --> 03:50:13.988]  Take care.
[03:50:13.988 --> 03:50:15.409]  We'll be following what you're going to do.
[03:50:15.409 --> 03:50:18.491]  And again, they're going to be at the Denver protest.
[03:50:18.491 --> 03:50:20.172]  That's going to be in about an hour.
[03:50:20.172 --> 03:50:22.434]  A little over an hour now.
[03:50:22.434 --> 03:50:23.415]  An hour and ten minutes.
[03:50:23.415 --> 03:50:24.916]  Yeah, three o'clock central it's going to start.
[03:50:24.916 --> 03:50:26.978]  Yeah, three o'clock central in Denver.
[03:50:29.520 --> 03:50:30.300]  That's right.
[03:50:30.300 --> 03:50:33.261]  3 o'clock local time there in Denver, Mountain Standard Time.
[03:50:33.261 --> 03:50:37.103]  That's going to be on the west steps of the Colorado State Capitol building.
[03:50:37.103 --> 03:50:41.144]  Thank you so much Rob Dew and Joe Biggs, our reporters there in Denver, Colorado.
[03:50:41.144 --> 03:50:42.945]  We'll be covering that on the Nightly News tonight.
[03:50:42.945 --> 03:50:45.146]  Stay with us, we've got one more segment in the fourth hour.
[03:51:00.658 --> 03:51:07.682]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[03:51:07.682 --> 03:51:12.324]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.
[03:51:12.324 --> 03:51:22.809]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary, broad-spectrum, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal solution that can be used inside the body as well as on the skin.
[03:51:23.109 --> 03:51:36.704]  Supernatural silver is unique and superior to colloidal and ionic silvers, using a patented technology that is highly effective against colds, flus, infections, food poisoning, and yeast, in addition to many other pathogens.
[03:51:38.046 --> 03:51:38.686]  We're good to go.
[03:51:59.978 --> 03:52:02.580]  Are you worried about how dangerous the world has become?
[03:52:02.580 --> 03:52:09.864]  In these days of terrorists, attacks, natural disasters, or even a future collapse, you need to be medically prepared to keep your family safe.
[03:52:09.864 --> 03:52:19.070]  I'm Joe Alton, MD of store.doomandbloom.net, where you'll find an entire line of uniquely designed medical kits and supplies for when help is not on the way.
[03:52:19.070 --> 03:52:26.054]  For everything from individual first aid kits to the ultimate family medical bag, go to store.doomandbloom.net today.
[03:52:26.054 --> 03:52:28.335]  That's store.doomandbloom.net.
[03:52:28.335 --> 03:52:29.396]  You'll be glad you did.
[03:52:29.756 --> 03:52:37.621]  If you want to raise the next generation of patriot leaders, take a look at Freedom Project Academy, a Judeo-Christian online school for kindergarten through high school.
[03:52:37.621 --> 03:52:40.343]  No common core teaching methods or high-stakes testing.
[03:52:40.343 --> 03:52:46.688]  Freedom Project Academy is government-free, doesn't accept any government funding, and is a fully accredited private school.
[03:52:46.688 --> 03:52:50.030]  All classes are taught live online with real teachers across the country.
[03:52:50.030 --> 03:52:53.492]  Open enrollment runs March through July, but classes fill up quickly.
[03:52:53.492 --> 03:52:56.394]  Check them out at fpeusa.org.
[03:52:56.394 --> 03:52:58.356]  That's fpeusa.org.
[03:52:59.858 --> 03:53:04.040]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[03:53:04.040 --> 03:53:10.242]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[03:53:10.242 --> 03:53:12.003]  How is this even possible?
[03:53:12.003 --> 03:53:19.546]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[03:53:19.546 --> 03:53:27.289]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[03:53:27.509 --> 03:53:31.871]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[03:53:31.871 --> 03:53:40.636]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[03:53:40.636 --> 03:53:42.217]  But you must act fast.
[03:53:42.217 --> 03:53:46.759]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard, our supply is extremely limited right now.
[03:53:47.039 --> 03:53:50.941]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[03:53:50.941 --> 03:53:51.961]  That's Greens75.com.
[03:53:51.961 --> 03:53:52.402]  Greens75.com.
[03:54:08.146 --> 03:54:12.687]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, and of course we have some new news out of North Carolina.
[03:54:12.687 --> 03:54:22.951]  Something that, as they have these bathroom wars going on in North Carolina, I believe this is going to bring the people of North Carolina to their knees.
[03:54:22.951 --> 03:54:26.572]  Ringo Starr has cancelled his performance in North Carolina.
[03:54:28.030 --> 03:54:30.151]  And when I told that to my kids, they said, Ringo who?
[03:54:30.151 --> 03:54:33.611]  I said, no, no, not the who, man, the Beatles, you know, Ringo.
[03:54:33.611 --> 03:54:34.872]  Remember him?
[03:54:34.872 --> 03:54:38.012]  His audience is now 64, I guess.
[03:54:38.012 --> 03:54:51.115]  But I guess the question, we were talking about this, my wife said, well, that's an interesting point because, you know, you got all these people like Bruce Springsteen and Ringo Starr cancelling their concerts in North Carolina.
[03:54:51.115 --> 03:54:52.636]  Why can't they be sued?
[03:54:53.596 --> 03:54:57.058]  You know, just like the people who don't bake cakes or take pictures.
[03:54:57.058 --> 03:54:59.859]  You know, they have a public business, so they have to perform.
[03:54:59.859 --> 03:55:01.640]  They have to perform their service.
[03:55:01.640 --> 03:55:13.787]  So, why can these people who have already, many of them, sold their tickets, why can't they be sued because they've now decided that they don't want to go through with this public performance, this public business?
[03:55:13.787 --> 03:55:20.711]  I guess it's because sexual preference trumps religious preference, doesn't it?
[03:55:21.798 --> 03:55:23.119]  That's what the left is telling us.
[03:55:23.119 --> 03:55:26.501]  But there's not anything about sexual preference in the Constitution.
[03:55:26.501 --> 03:55:30.623]  There is, however, something about religious preference.
[03:55:30.623 --> 03:55:31.924]  But it doesn't even get to that point.
[03:55:31.924 --> 03:55:35.606]  And it's not just the Hollywood types that are there.
[03:55:35.606 --> 03:55:36.807]  We've also got Deutsche Bank.
[03:55:37.560 --> 03:55:43.781]  Has now halted its expansion that would have meant 250 jobs in Kerry because of the law, they say.
[03:55:43.781 --> 03:55:49.542]  And I guess this is the first time Deutsche Bank has really paid any attention to any law.
[03:55:49.542 --> 03:55:51.562]  And I'm going to tell you about that in just a moment.
[03:55:51.562 --> 03:55:54.203]  Real quickly, though, we've got some of the presidential candidates weighing in.
[03:55:54.203 --> 03:55:57.183]  John Kasich says, well, I think it's the wrong thing.
[03:55:57.183 --> 03:56:02.724]  I think we ought to let people come into these women's bathrooms and boys showering with girls.
[03:56:02.724 --> 03:56:04.225]  He didn't actually say that.
[03:56:04.225 --> 03:56:06.865]  He said that he thought we should
[03:56:07.525 --> 03:56:20.938]  Do this out of concerns for discrimination LGBT discrimination now the lieutenant governor pointed out as it was Explaining what's going on to people who aren't really following this too closely like John Kasich and
[03:56:21.511 --> 03:56:26.393]  He said this is a defensive measure designed to preserve a common-sense status quo.
[03:56:26.393 --> 03:56:28.354]  This is a New American covering this.
[03:56:28.354 --> 03:56:36.397]  He said there's a giant loophole that they created in this ordinance that would allow any person to enter any bathroom at any time.
[03:56:36.397 --> 03:56:40.859]  So a man can enter a woman's bathroom, a woman's locker, a shower facility.
[03:56:40.859 --> 03:56:43.480]  They could enter a girl's bathroom, a girl's locker.
[03:56:43.480 --> 03:56:48.142]  The Charlotte Ordinance said the business community also had to comply with this ordinance.
[03:56:49.062 --> 03:56:52.505]  Performers don't have to honor the tickets that they've sold.
[03:56:52.505 --> 03:56:55.408]  They can just cancel it at their discrimination.
[03:56:55.408 --> 03:56:56.048]  Okay?
[03:56:56.048 --> 03:57:01.633]  They said it was sex discrimination to have a men's room and to have a women's room labeled on your doors.
[03:57:01.633 --> 03:57:02.393]  All right?
[03:57:02.393 --> 03:57:06.757]  Now, we've had Ted Cruz weigh into this as well, and he is on the right side of this issue.
[03:57:06.757 --> 03:57:10.100]  He said, bathroom bills are perfectly reasonable.
[03:57:10.100 --> 03:57:11.201]  Yeah, I think it is.
[03:57:11.201 --> 03:57:14.464]  I think it is absolutely crazy that they would
[03:57:15.746 --> 03:57:17.307]  I have an issue with this.
[03:57:17.307 --> 03:57:23.470]  Of course, we've had many of our friends putting stuff on Facebook from North Carolina.
[03:57:23.470 --> 03:57:28.673]  Some of them would say, well, you know, I never thought I would have to have a birth certificate to go into the bathroom.
[03:57:28.673 --> 03:57:30.914]  Well, you know, you don't really need a birth certificate.
[03:57:30.914 --> 03:57:37.598]  And these are typically our Democrat friends who never thought that the president should need a birth certificate either.
[03:57:37.598 --> 03:57:40.260]  But I think we definitely need one for him.
[03:57:40.260 --> 03:57:43.201]  We don't need one, however, to get into the bathrooms.
[03:57:43.201 --> 03:57:44.242]  Just the law said that
[03:57:44.882 --> 03:57:49.005]  You go into the bathroom or the locker room that matches the gender of your birth certificate.
[03:57:49.005 --> 03:57:54.548]  That's just a legal way of saying we're not going to let men or boys go into the girls shower.
[03:57:54.548 --> 03:57:55.028]  Okay?
[03:57:55.028 --> 03:57:56.129]  That's all that amounts to.
[03:57:56.129 --> 03:57:59.971]  And if you're confused as to which one that applies to you, just look down your pants.
[03:57:59.971 --> 03:58:01.532]  You might be able to figure it out.
[03:58:01.532 --> 03:58:09.716]  But when I talk about Deutsche Bank, remember these are the people that a year ago got the biggest fine for LIBOR manipulation, manipulating the currency markets?
[03:58:09.716 --> 03:58:10.117]  Now,
[03:58:10.797 --> 03:58:14.920]  They've been admitted that they manipulated the silver market.
[03:58:14.920 --> 03:58:31.431]  This is a very interesting story from Zero Hedge and I wish I had more time to talk about this because what they did was it was a lawsuit and somehow magically overnight it just went away and they said we're going to pay money to keep this quiet and this information may be useful in the other lawsuits against the other usual suspects.
[03:58:31.431 --> 03:58:33.032]  Join us tonight 7 central 8 p.m.
[03:58:33.032 --> 03:58:34.053]  Eastern for the nightly news.
