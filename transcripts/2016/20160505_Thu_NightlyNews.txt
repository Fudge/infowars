[00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.420]  Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.423]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:23.444]  I'm Darren McBreen.
[00:00:23.484 --> 00:00:25.607]  It is Thursday, May 5th, 2016.
[00:00:26.709 --> 00:00:28.331]  Here's a quick look at what's coming up.
[00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:39.776]  However, some people have more equal rights than others, and actually we are making sure that marginalized groups get their views heard.
[00:00:40.376 --> 00:00:53.647]  Social justice warriors take a break from quoting Animal Farm to address the new oppression of the day, park ranger uniforms, and... I'm not gonna pay for that f***ing wall.
[00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.527]  He should pay for it.
[00:00:55.767 --> 00:00:56.627]  He's got the money.
[00:00:57.988 --> 00:01:00.730]  Are you afraid that he's going to be the next president of the United States?
[00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.650]  No, not at all.
[00:01:01.931 --> 00:01:02.891]  What would that mean for Mexico?
[00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:03.331]  No, not at all.
[00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:06.233]  Democracy cannot take us to crazy people.
[00:01:06.693 --> 00:01:09.515]  How are you going to make them pay for the wall?
[00:01:10.296 --> 00:01:13.397]  I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller.
[00:01:13.578 --> 00:01:13.938]  Believe me.
[00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.399]  It's got 10 feet taller.
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.403]  And like it or not, Trump says the wall is coming, and it's going to be huge.
[00:01:22.423 --> 00:01:23.984]  That's next.
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:12.226]  Donald Trump says a nation without borders is not a nation, and we need to build a wall across the southern border.
[00:03:12.686 --> 00:03:22.052]  Liberals, social justice warriors, and much of the mainstream media, they believe that Trump's wall to stop illegal immigration is racist.
[00:03:23.553 --> 00:03:24.234]  But wait a minute.
[00:03:24.595 --> 00:03:26.076]  What about Hillary Clinton?
[00:03:26.357 --> 00:03:28.600]  How come nobody's calling her a racist?
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:39.374]  After all, it was Hillary who voted for a 700-mile anti-immigration wall known as the Secure Fence Act of 2006.
[00:03:41.777 --> 00:03:42.478]  You want a wall then?
[00:03:42.778 --> 00:03:44.759]  No, we've already... You said that.
[00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.901]  Well, I voted for border security and some of it was a fence.
[00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:50.321]  I don't think we ever called it a wall.
[00:03:50.361 --> 00:03:51.902]  Maybe in some places it was a wall.
[00:03:52.282 --> 00:03:54.984]  But it was aimed at controlling our borders.
[00:03:55.684 --> 00:04:01.967]  And don't forget it was only a couple of years ago when Hillary sounded Trumpian on this issue.
[00:04:02.627 --> 00:04:06.930]  We've got to do several things and I am, you know, adamantly against illegal immigrants.
[00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.451]  You see, that was then, but this is now.
[00:04:10.663 --> 00:04:18.506]  And today, in 2016, the idea of securing our borders has somehow become politically incorrect.
[00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:27.290]  And that's why Hillary and Bernie Sanders, too, by the way, they both voted for a 700-mile wall in 2006.
[00:04:28.731 --> 00:04:35.994]  But today, somehow, the idea of Trump's wall is racist and it's hurting people's feelings.
[00:04:37.148 --> 00:04:40.992]  When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.
[00:04:41.593 --> 00:04:42.634]  They're not sending you.
[00:04:43.054 --> 00:04:44.115]  They're not sending you.
[00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:50.743]  They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us.
[00:04:52.483 --> 00:04:53.464]  They're bringing drugs.
[00:04:54.185 --> 00:04:55.206]  They're bringing crime.
[00:04:55.766 --> 00:04:56.487]  They're rapists.
[00:04:56.887 --> 00:04:59.250]  And some, I assume, are good people.
[00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.913]  And that's the clip that started it all right there, my friends.
[00:05:03.273 --> 00:05:06.837]  So many people got butthurt and offended by that statement.
[00:05:07.277 --> 00:05:11.421]  And that's why all the Latino protesters in
[00:05:12.122 --> 00:05:18.229]  Costa Mesa started rioting because they somehow turned that into Trump hates Mexicans.
[00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.994]  And he says that they are all criminals and murderers and rapists.
[00:05:23.715 --> 00:05:26.337]  And they always say that Trump is bad for America.
[00:05:26.598 --> 00:05:27.599]  He's a bad man.
[00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:33.065]  Meanwhile, they're out there waving every flag you can think of but the American flag.
[00:05:33.165 --> 00:05:33.866]  Ever notice that?
[00:05:34.386 --> 00:05:49.513]  This one guy, he's so stupid, he told our reporters that it's incorrect that Mexicans are bringing bad people into the country, and then to prove it, he ran off and started vandalizing the place, picking fights, and joining the riots.
[00:05:50.153 --> 00:05:55.116]  Now, I don't know if that guy is an immigrant, but I do know that he's ignorant.
[00:05:55.876 --> 00:05:59.319]  Because Trump never said Mexicans are rapists and criminals.
[00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:05.443]  These people are too stupid to even know that they are protesting, excuse me, rioting.
[00:06:05.804 --> 00:06:08.385]  Now, I want to show you some statistics right now.
[00:06:08.425 --> 00:06:10.887]  This is from an article that's on Breitbart.
[00:06:11.228 --> 00:06:15.531]  Illegal alien crime accounts for over 30% of murders in many states.
[00:06:18.553 --> 00:06:27.425]  Between 2008 and 2014, 40% of all murder convictions in Florida were criminal aliens.
[00:06:27.785 --> 00:06:29.007]  That's illegal immigrants.
[00:06:29.427 --> 00:06:30.328]  In New York, it was 34%.
[00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.172]  In my home state of Arizona, 17.8%.
[00:06:35.675 --> 00:06:55.641]  During those years, criminal aliens accounted for 38% of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida, and New York, while illegal aliens constitute only 5.6% of the total population in those states.
[00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:56.942]  And that's according to U.S.
[00:06:57.442 --> 00:07:01.243]  Census estimates, which probably means more like 11 to 15%
[00:07:03.584 --> 00:07:05.466]  So I think you're starting to get the picture.
[00:07:05.586 --> 00:07:09.109]  A large number of illegal immigrants are criminals.
[00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:11.251]  And that means rapists.
[00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:13.733]  And yes, that means murderers.
[00:07:13.753 --> 00:07:15.594]  And we're getting tired of it.
[00:07:16.115 --> 00:07:24.082]  And if you look at the map demographically, most of Trump's Latino supporters are living right there on the border states.
[00:07:24.542 --> 00:07:36.326]  They live in counties where they see lots of crime and lots of harm being done to their families and their communities by these criminal thugs who are crossing the border illegally and committing all these crimes.
[00:07:36.887 --> 00:07:39.208]  So enough with the race baiting.
[00:07:39.348 --> 00:07:41.508]  We are all getting tired of it.
[00:07:42.109 --> 00:07:52.933]  All of us multi-cultured Americans and let me tell you something folks, we are unified on this issue and that's why Donald Trump is going to be our next president.
[00:07:53.653 --> 00:07:55.174]  So we have this open border.
[00:07:55.674 --> 00:07:56.935]  It's a sieve.
[00:07:57.095 --> 00:07:58.716]  It's like water pouring through.
[00:07:58.836 --> 00:08:00.858]  People are coming in by the hundreds of thousands.
[00:08:01.238 --> 00:08:02.779]  We have no idea who's coming in.
[00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:04.420]  And it's not just from the border.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.161]  Talk to the border security.
[00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:08.402]  You will see the kind of people coming.
[00:08:08.623 --> 00:08:10.844]  You'll see the kind of crime that's being committed.
[00:08:11.204 --> 00:08:12.485]  And we're taking these people.
[00:08:12.765 --> 00:08:16.267]  And by the way, just to finish on that, it's common sense.
[00:08:16.708 --> 00:08:19.910]  They don't want these people, so they send them to the United States.
[00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:38.642]  This is, in my opinion, the most critical issue of the 2016 presidential race, because it will define whether or not there will even be an America anymore, because I tell you what, if this keeps up, you won't even be able to recognize our country in the near future.
[00:08:39.202 --> 00:08:44.146]  This election will define America in the 21st century.
[00:08:46.387 --> 00:08:47.088]  Do I look great?
[00:08:49.346 --> 00:08:51.309]  The end of the republic has never looked better.
[00:08:57.477 --> 00:09:00.681]  It's time to shake the rust off America's foreign policy.
[00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:09.882]  No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first.
[00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:10.983]  Shut up!
[00:09:11.063 --> 00:09:11.984]  Shut the f**k up!
[00:09:12.044 --> 00:09:14.727]  You don't look good for your health, homie!
[00:09:14.787 --> 00:09:16.168]  This represents slavery!
[00:09:16.368 --> 00:09:16.929]  Colonialism!
[00:09:16.969 --> 00:09:17.970]  Genocide!
[00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.251]  Oppression!
[00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:22.254]  And it's alright to burn the s**t!
[00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:29.292]  Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours.
[00:09:29.832 --> 00:09:35.459]  And we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same.
[00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:39.264]  He said that us Mexicans are bringing all types of bad people to this country?
[00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:40.666]  That's incorrect, dude!
[00:09:48.083 --> 00:09:49.064]  They're bringing drugs.
[00:09:49.424 --> 00:09:51.205]  We just caught these guys coming across the border.
[00:09:51.445 --> 00:09:53.406]  One, two, three, four.
[00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.406]  They have big satchels.
[00:09:54.687 --> 00:09:55.687]  They're bringing crime.
[00:09:58.789 --> 00:10:04.012]  They're rapists.
[00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:09.435]  And some, I assume, are good people.
[00:10:13.308 --> 00:10:19.394]  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[00:10:20.315 --> 00:10:25.300]  The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony.
[00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.811]  You think we have kids because we like sex?
[00:10:34.871 --> 00:10:36.672]  No, we're having kids ready to start this war.
[00:10:36.712 --> 00:10:37.373]  Believe me.
[00:10:37.773 --> 00:10:38.974]  I got another one on the way.
[00:10:38.994 --> 00:10:40.635]  She'll be strapped up ready for you.
[00:10:40.675 --> 00:10:41.296]  Come get it.
[00:10:41.796 --> 00:10:42.396]  Come get it.
[00:10:42.436 --> 00:10:44.018]  Come knock on my door and see what happens.
[00:10:44.618 --> 00:10:45.118]  We're ready.
[00:10:45.459 --> 00:10:45.919]  We're ready.
[00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:48.341]  We're going to build a wall.
[00:10:48.521 --> 00:10:49.581]  It's going to be built.
[00:10:50.062 --> 00:10:53.304]  I voted for border security and some of it was a fence.
[00:10:53.324 --> 00:10:54.765]  I don't think we ever called it a wall.
[00:10:54.825 --> 00:10:56.506]  Maybe in some places it was a wall.
[00:10:56.586 --> 00:10:58.988]  He's not only a racist.
[00:10:59.028 --> 00:11:00.929]  He's not only a misogynist.
[00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.031]  He's a fascist.
[00:11:16.883 --> 00:11:18.565]  Trump is a Nazi!
[00:11:18.945 --> 00:11:20.127]  Trump is a Nazi!
[00:11:20.427 --> 00:11:21.648]  Trump is a Nazi!
[00:11:21.868 --> 00:11:22.729]  Trump is a Nazi!
[00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:23.450]  Trump is a Nazi!
[00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.431]  Trump is a Nazi!
[00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:25.712]  Trump is a Nazi!
[00:11:25.833 --> 00:11:28.015]  He is hurting our unity at home.
[00:11:28.035 --> 00:11:29.937]  Why don't you turn your camera?
[00:11:29.997 --> 00:11:32.059]  Show them how many people come to these rallies.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.000]  Turn them!
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.901]  Go ahead, turn them!
[00:11:34.802 --> 00:11:35.343]  Go ahead!
[00:11:45.481 --> 00:11:52.917]  And just when you thought political correctness couldn't get any more ridiculous and absurd, ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
[00:11:54.349 --> 00:11:56.850]  The Hispanic Access Foundation.
[00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:07.532]  This is a coalition of Latino activists and civil rights groups who have been triggered by, wait for it, park ranger uniforms.
[00:12:08.072 --> 00:12:10.432]  Not making this up, this is, this is real.
[00:12:10.792 --> 00:12:18.334]  Because they say our nation's park ranger uniforms threaten Latinos because they look too much like,
[00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:20.394]  Border Patrol!
[00:12:21.194 --> 00:12:29.676]  The Hispanic Access Foundation is asking Presidente Obama for an executive order to address the issue.
[00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:31.357]  Barack Obama!
[00:12:31.757 --> 00:12:33.737]  Tear down those uniforms!
[00:12:34.437 --> 00:12:47.120]  They also want the park rangers to get different trucks, vans, and SUVs because they look too much like the Border Patrol vehicles and that could trigger some people into feeling very uncomfortable.
[00:12:47.765 --> 00:12:56.649]  Now, I don't know if these activists have any suggestions of what they would like the new uniforms to look like, but I have a few suggestions.
[00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.889]  How about this one?
[00:12:58.389 --> 00:13:00.070]  This looks non-threatening to me.
[00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.091]  I mean, you gotta admit, it's a little squirrel on there.
[00:13:03.331 --> 00:13:05.612]  That takes you to a safe place, doesn't it?
[00:13:05.972 --> 00:13:09.834]  I would not feel threatened by a guy wearing that outfit.
[00:13:10.854 --> 00:13:11.494]  Or here's one.
[00:13:11.715 --> 00:13:13.215]  This is real cute.
[00:13:14.196 --> 00:13:15.616]  I think it's also very fashionable.
[00:13:16.177 --> 00:13:21.159]  I think liberals would agree that if you're going to wuss out, do it with style.
[00:13:21.819 --> 00:13:28.423]  And this next one, you might think I'm being a little silly, but hey, if you're going to do this, you might as well go all the way, right?
[00:13:29.083 --> 00:13:30.804]  Guaranteed not to offend.
[00:13:31.084 --> 00:13:34.146]  Instead of park rangers, why not
[00:13:35.186 --> 00:13:36.107]  Power Rangers.
[00:13:36.467 --> 00:13:39.530]  Now look, I'm not trying to turn this into The Daily Show.
[00:13:40.071 --> 00:13:43.554]  I'm just saying, give me a f***ing break.
[00:13:48.718 --> 00:13:56.746]  The stories are up on Infowars.com saying that they're going to riot, they're going to burn stuff down if Trump gets the nomination.
[00:13:57.887 --> 00:13:58.467]  What are you going to do?
[00:13:58.507 --> 00:14:00.049]  Burn down your own neighborhood and then
[00:14:01.035 --> 00:14:06.580]  Maybe shoot some firefighters and, you know, get put in prison and then wonder why no one puts businesses in your neighborhood.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.502]  Oh, that'll really show everyone.
[00:14:08.522 --> 00:14:24.076]  And then that'll create massive racial and cultural division in America, which the globalists, the same ones that run the media, the same ones that put Beyonce on during the Super Bowl, you know, saying, attack the police and saying, hate your boyfriend or your husband and beat cars with baseball bats.
[00:14:24.276 --> 00:14:26.038]  They're teaching all this fake rebellion.
[00:14:27.287 --> 00:14:44.616]  So you'll go out and rebel against the cops, or against your husband, or against the gringo, or against the whatever the case is, thinking you're doing something when all you're doing is dividing and conquering the country, just how the British Empire and the Roman Empire and every other empire always controlled its vassals.
[00:14:45.016 --> 00:14:46.296]  You know what a vassal is?
[00:14:46.456 --> 00:14:47.297]  It's a slave.
[00:14:53.072 --> 00:14:57.431]  Totally ridiculous to see what the public schools and the universities...
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:27.188]  And MTV and the NFL and every other mainstream cultural avenue pushes race-based, hate-filled, black and Hispanic and Asian groups to run around vitriolically saying white people are the progenitors of all forms of evil on the globe so that classically liberal white people will circle the wagons, self-segregate, and be the management class in the collapsing West.
[00:15:28.567 --> 00:15:29.788]  Over all the other groups.
[00:15:30.569 --> 00:15:40.738]  So they're actually bringing back classical racism, but through the left, and the people caught up in it have no idea how sophisticated the operation is.
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:50.186]  But it's amazing, as the Gateway Pundit reports, anti-Trump groups, big Republican donors like the Koch brothers, spent $75.7 million
[00:15:55.004 --> 00:15:55.765]  All right.
[00:16:09.991 --> 00:16:11.572]  But it flipped, and it's already going way back up.
[00:16:11.872 --> 00:16:12.452]  And why is that?
[00:16:12.832 --> 00:16:35.782]  Because the establishment left, all over the country came out, following the mainstream media directive, and beat up the evil crackers, beat up the evil gringos, the trendy white justice warrior, white knights, spit on and attacked the other evil Trump supporters, beat up the Hispanic Trump supporters, beat up the black Trump supporters, spit on everyone,
[00:16:36.582 --> 00:16:41.163]  And the mainstream media didn't really cover it, starting in Chicago and other areas.
[00:16:41.183 --> 00:16:44.324]  They lied and said it was all Trump's fault, and Ted Cruz said it was all Trump's fault.
[00:16:44.584 --> 00:16:56.347]  But the Internet, and Infowars.com, more than anybody, our reporters, Rob Dew, Josh Owens, and others on the ground, showing everybody how it's done.
[00:16:57.742 --> 00:16:59.903]  Went to town, after town, after town.
[00:17:00.663 --> 00:17:13.467]  Joe Biggs and the rest of the crew just always going out to town, after town, after town and city and showing the vile anti-free speech, foaming at the mouth, frothing hordes.
[00:17:16.668 --> 00:17:18.868]  And it educated everyone very, very quickly.
[00:17:18.948 --> 00:17:20.809]  I mean, conservatively.
[00:17:21.846 --> 00:17:33.436]  Just our videos every week showing people knocking out windows, attacking cars, beating people up, screaming Viva La Raza for those inside the race, everything, for those outside the race, nothing.
[00:17:33.456 --> 00:17:36.158]  I mean, that is a literal Nazi slogan if whites were using it.
[00:17:36.618 --> 00:17:42.143]  That is literal Adolf Hitler talk, but being spewed by university brainwashed Hispanics.
[00:17:45.005 --> 00:17:45.846]  And it blew up in their face.
[00:17:48.042 --> 00:17:52.504]  10 million views every week, separate from all our other views and listeners.
[00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:53.724]  10 million!
[00:17:54.624 --> 00:18:03.207]  And by the way, that's just on our channels on Facebook and our YouTube channels, not even counting what we show to millions on radio and TV, and not counting everybody else's sites.
[00:18:03.327 --> 00:18:04.428]  I don't have time to go look.
[00:18:05.288 --> 00:18:17.152]  I went and looked at one video Rob Deuce shot in California that had 3.4 million views on one of our channels, half a million on the other channel, and then I found another channel with 2 million views, another channel with 4 million views,
[00:18:17.392 --> 00:18:20.036]  I mean that's like 10 million views one video.
[00:18:20.216 --> 00:18:24.503]  So when I say 10 million, that is a giant understatement because I don't have time to go track it all.
[00:18:24.823 --> 00:18:27.067]  Because I'm too busy moving on to the next globalist target.
[00:18:28.308 --> 00:18:29.390]  That is devastation.
[00:18:30.376 --> 00:18:32.077]  And of course, Trump is a dinosaur.
[00:18:32.277 --> 00:18:35.738]  But at least he is a patriot and a nationalist, it appears.
[00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:38.419]  He still goes on the Little Fox and Friends.
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.741]  And he still goes on the O'Reilly with his 3 million viewers.
[00:18:41.781 --> 00:18:43.941]  And he still does all that judiciously.
[00:18:44.142 --> 00:18:45.862]  We're not here clamoring like baby birds.
[00:18:45.922 --> 00:18:46.743]  Please come on, Trump.
[00:18:47.003 --> 00:18:47.783]  Please come on, Trump.
[00:18:48.043 --> 00:18:49.564]  We just want the insides of the campaign.
[00:18:50.564 --> 00:18:53.405]  We don't care if a, you know, senator or somebody comes on.
[00:18:53.665 --> 00:18:54.586]  People tune out for that.
[00:18:54.806 --> 00:18:59.828]  Folks like Trump coming on, but not as much as just having some listener call in with a great point.
[00:19:04.906 --> 00:19:09.309]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.091]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.773 --> 00:19:15.774]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.435 --> 00:19:27.183]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type 1 civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.854 --> 00:19:39.220]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:50.126]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.
[00:22:47.091 --> 00:22:53.818]  Check out Brain Force today and other game-changing compounds like X2, Survival Shield, at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:23:14.448 --> 00:23:19.032]  Voting fraud activist Gary Welsh was found dead leading up to the Indiana primary.
[00:23:19.212 --> 00:23:30.863]  Police found Welsh's body in an apartment complex stairwell in Indianapolis, Indiana on May 1st with, as a witness reported, a gun lying beside him and quickly ruled it a suicide.
[00:23:31.024 --> 00:23:33.506]  Investigative journalist Wayne Madsen reported
[00:23:33.826 --> 00:23:34.047]  I'm good.
[00:23:48.729 --> 00:23:49.369]  We're good to go.
[00:24:07.122 --> 00:24:12.248]  My prediction is that Trump wins Indiana with just shy of 50% of the vote.
[00:24:12.468 --> 00:24:23.660]  Welsh was also one of the insiders who told Madsen about the foam parties Rubio reportedly attended during the early to mid-1990s at gay entertainment venues in South Florida.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:34.829]  He was the source of the photographs of the guy who looked an awful lot like Rubio at the foam parties in South Beach, Miami.
[00:24:35.209 --> 00:24:42.975]  That made its way into the debate when Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, kept referring to Marco Rubio as the boy in the bubble.
[00:24:43.936 --> 00:24:46.076]  I think it was quite clear what he was referring to.
[00:24:46.517 --> 00:24:56.699]  Gary Welsh, who ran Advance Indiana out of Indianapolis, an attorney, a Republican party, but certainly not a Cruz guy or a Rubio guy.
[00:24:56.799 --> 00:24:58.039]  I believe he supported Trump.
[00:24:58.819 --> 00:25:01.660]  They're saying he shot and killed himself over the weekend.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.900]  They found a gun next to his body.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:08.441]  The police said, oh, well, we're basing our suicide, even without the autopsy.
[00:25:08.941 --> 00:25:12.942]  We know how cops are with autopsies, or the lack thereof.
[00:25:13.682 --> 00:25:14.303]  Yeah.
[00:25:31.658 --> 00:25:38.481]  But, you know, I mean, I get to the promised land, but he, you know, he obviously knew that his life was being threatened.
[00:25:38.721 --> 00:25:40.362]  With all these cases like the D.C.
[00:25:40.422 --> 00:25:57.149]  Manum, Danny Casolaro, Gary Webb, who I have been in contact with prior to his supposedly shooting himself twice in the head, the police find and reporters find friends that say, oh, he was despondent.
[00:25:58.373 --> 00:25:59.774]  He had financial problems.
[00:26:00.275 --> 00:26:02.496]  The New York Daily News said, well, he was gay.
[00:26:02.536 --> 00:26:04.898]  What in the world does that have to do with it?
[00:26:05.239 --> 00:26:06.019]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:06.279 --> 00:26:25.135]  Along with the revelations about Rubio's past, Welsh was also pushing the narrative surrounding the evidence that Ted Cruz's father, Rafael, was somehow involved in the JFK assassination, as this photo shows what appears to be Ted Cruz's father standing to Lee Harvey Oswald's left.
[00:26:25.535 --> 00:26:28.037]  As one of Welsh's clients, Greg Wright, wrote,
[00:26:28.237 --> 00:26:30.578]  Welsh was unafraid of unmasking corruption.
[00:26:30.758 --> 00:26:33.378]  Many of his friends had suggested that he be careful.
[00:26:33.578 --> 00:26:36.339]  He represented being a matter I'd put before the Commission.
[00:26:36.399 --> 00:26:47.742]  I had asked the election board if then-Senator Richard Lugar and his wife, Charlene, had voted illegally in Marion County because they have not lived at the home address on their registration for more than three decades.
[00:26:48.062 --> 00:26:49.562]  Gary won that case.
[00:26:49.842 --> 00:26:57.064]  The reasoning behind Welsh's untimely demise has been attributed to depression due to dealing with financial difficulties.
[00:26:57.304 --> 00:26:59.085]  But how can we ever know that for sure?
[00:26:59.445 --> 00:27:01.146]  Gary Welsh loved America.
[00:27:01.606 --> 00:27:07.550]  Uncovering corruption is one of the most positively invigorating pursuits anyone can experience.
[00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:18.195]  The elephant in the room here is, why would Welsh kill himself right before the results were to be announced for an election he was working tirelessly to influence?
[00:27:18.796 --> 00:27:20.797]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:27:26.411 --> 00:27:29.192]  Thank you for joining us in this Cinco de Mayo celebration.
[00:27:29.232 --> 00:27:36.514]  We'd like to ask all white people, please remove your American flag t-shirts at this point, so we can start the celebration.
[00:27:36.814 --> 00:27:37.894]  What does Cinco de Mayo mean?
[00:27:37.914 --> 00:27:43.035]  Cinco de Mayo is when the Mexican army fought against the French army.
[00:27:43.556 --> 00:27:45.236]  So, what happened in 1960, no 1860...
[00:27:50.147 --> 00:27:55.970]  The French army invaded Mexico because they wanted Mexico to pay for some debt.
[00:27:56.610 --> 00:28:02.412]  So they invaded and President Benito Juarez fought against the French.
[00:28:02.452 --> 00:28:04.453]  So it was just like some battles.
[00:28:04.633 --> 00:28:05.934]  The main battle was in Puebla.
[00:28:07.006 --> 00:28:11.667]  But here in the U.S., people celebrate it as Mexico's independence.
[00:28:11.747 --> 00:28:13.888]  Well, did you hear about what's going on in California?
[00:28:13.928 --> 00:28:30.553]  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals just ruled that on Cinco de Mayo that white high school students are not allowed to display the red, white, and blue or display American flag t-shirts during Cinco de Mayo for fear it may cause racial tension.
[00:28:30.573 --> 00:28:31.333]  What do you think about that?
[00:28:31.553 --> 00:28:36.877]  I mean, if they take it as a racial thing, I wouldn't take it as that.
[00:28:37.037 --> 00:28:39.779]  I mean, they have the right to wear the flag every day.
[00:28:39.799 --> 00:28:41.740]  Do you agree with that, or what are your thoughts on that?
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.361]  It's a very difficult subject.
[00:28:44.542 --> 00:28:49.485]  I think it's a shame to tell people they can't wear their t-shirt with their flag on it.
[00:28:49.685 --> 00:28:51.386]  I don't think that that's right.
[00:28:51.686 --> 00:28:55.429]  I mean, you should get to wear what you want to wear, even if it offends people.
[00:28:55.569 --> 00:28:57.030]  I personally wouldn't wear red, white, and blue.
[00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:59.932]  I feel like that's an unnecessary statement.
[00:29:02.294 --> 00:29:06.116]  It does seem to be bred in controversy and trying to create scandal.
[00:29:06.137 --> 00:29:09.699]  That's all you want!
[00:29:09.719 --> 00:29:15.864]  That's all you want!
[00:29:15.944 --> 00:29:18.806]  It kind of goes against, like, the whole, our freedom laws.
[00:29:18.866 --> 00:29:20.587]  I mean, we're allowed to do whatever we want, right?
[00:29:20.888 --> 00:29:24.671]  But I do think it's, like, bad on their part to antagonize other people's culture.
[00:29:24.691 --> 00:29:30.235]  Gosh, I just wish people would have empathy and understand that we are a nation of immigrants.
[00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:33.851]  You're doing it wrong!
[00:29:33.891 --> 00:29:34.832]  You're doing it wrong!
[00:29:34.952 --> 00:29:40.717]  I think we do live in America and if you want to show your American pride you should be able to do that every day of the year.
[00:29:41.278 --> 00:29:44.001]  However, it shouldn't be used to target against other students.
[00:29:44.261 --> 00:29:50.146]  Americans across the country are using the time to rally in support of comprehensive immigration reform.
[00:29:50.267 --> 00:29:52.228]  Why can't we have a vote on this?
[00:29:53.049 --> 00:29:54.330]  11 million people
[00:29:55.154 --> 00:29:59.356]  Hoping to have a legal status and hope and a path to citizenship.
[00:29:59.396 --> 00:30:03.777]  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says we should celebrate it by immigration reform.
[00:30:03.797 --> 00:30:04.397]  What do you think of that?
[00:30:04.597 --> 00:30:05.218]  Absolutely.
[00:30:05.618 --> 00:30:06.398]  The sooner the better.
[00:30:06.718 --> 00:30:09.339]  I think immigration reform is absolutely essential.
[00:30:09.859 --> 00:30:11.000]  We need it desperately.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.760]  Happy Cinco de Mayo, my friend.
[00:30:17.862 --> 00:30:19.583]  You'll say my Spanish okay to piensas.
[00:30:27.521 --> 00:30:30.923]  Viva la raza!
[00:30:31.003 --> 00:30:33.064]  Que viva!
[00:30:33.905 --> 00:30:35.605]  Go back to Boston!
[00:30:37.346 --> 00:30:39.067]  Go back to the Plymouth Rocks!
[00:30:39.387 --> 00:30:40.308]  You Pilgrims!
[00:30:41.088 --> 00:30:41.989]  Get out!
[00:30:42.229 --> 00:30:43.970]  We are the future!
[00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.031]  We decrypt the borders!
[00:30:46.091 --> 00:30:48.892]  We're illegal aliens!
[00:30:49.192 --> 00:30:50.893]  We're illegal aliens!
[00:30:55.656 --> 00:31:04.183]  We claim this land is ours, it's always been ours, and we're still here.
[00:31:05.143 --> 00:31:07.205]  And none of this talk about deporting.
[00:31:07.245 --> 00:31:09.287]  If anybody's going to be deported, it's going to be you.
[00:31:09.487 --> 00:31:12.169]  The United States is who is the immigrant here, not us.
[00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:18.895]  Why is it that these people, these frail, racist, white people, want to keep us out of this country?
[00:31:19.884 --> 00:31:22.167]  It's not because simply the color of our skin.
[00:31:22.567 --> 00:31:25.010]  It's not simply because they just want to exploit us.
[00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:26.151]  Let me tell you why.
[00:31:26.972 --> 00:31:35.041]  Because on this planet right now, of six billion people, at the forefront of the revolutionary movement is the Raza.
[00:31:35.462 --> 00:31:36.223]  When you go to Venezuela...
[00:31:38.374 --> 00:31:39.354]  You can't stop us.
[00:31:39.394 --> 00:31:40.215]  There's too many of us.
[00:31:40.255 --> 00:31:40.675]  We're ready.
[00:31:41.435 --> 00:31:42.636]  We're breeding by the day.
[00:31:42.656 --> 00:31:52.279]  It's about assuring that we increase our numbers.
[00:32:08.689 --> 00:32:10.530]  That we increase our numbers at every level.
[00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:13.150]  And let me tell you, we can't go back.
[00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:14.431]  You know, we're in a civil war.
[00:32:14.451 --> 00:32:16.971]  This is America, whites!
[00:32:17.091 --> 00:32:19.252]  You're too white to be American!
[00:32:19.292 --> 00:32:21.713]  Go back to Europe!
[00:32:21.753 --> 00:32:24.514]  This used to be Mexico, you know what I mean?
[00:32:25.114 --> 00:32:28.535]  And the people that were here before, they're just not going to get up and leave.
[00:32:28.715 --> 00:32:29.195]  Mexico!
[00:32:29.375 --> 00:32:30.295]  Mexico!
[00:32:30.395 --> 00:32:31.396]  Mexico!
[00:32:31.476 --> 00:32:32.816]  Mexico!
[00:32:32.976 --> 00:32:33.676]  Arriba Mexico!
[00:32:33.716 --> 00:32:34.356]  Viva!
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.521]  You think we have kids because we like sex?
[00:32:39.581 --> 00:32:41.362]  No, we're having kids ready to start this war.
[00:32:41.402 --> 00:32:42.002]  Believe me.
[00:32:42.463 --> 00:32:43.603]  I got another one on the way.
[00:32:43.623 --> 00:32:45.325]  She'll be strapped up ready for you.
[00:32:45.365 --> 00:32:45.965]  Come get it.
[00:32:46.505 --> 00:32:47.106]  Come get it.
[00:32:47.146 --> 00:32:49.227]  Come knock on my door and see what happens.
[00:32:49.307 --> 00:32:49.887]  We're ready.
[00:32:50.148 --> 00:32:51.548]  We're ready.
[00:32:52.289 --> 00:33:04.717]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.
[00:33:57.342 --> 00:34:05.626]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when products are sold out, you're unable to get them, sometimes for months, but we hold back the products for people that have already signed up for AutoShip.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:11.428 --> 00:37:20.531]  I'm down in downtown Austin today trying to find out why people think it's racist to wear an American flag shirt and or be an American on Cinco de Mayo.
[00:37:20.932 --> 00:37:22.452]  Let's see what people around here have to say.
[00:37:22.972 --> 00:37:26.874]  Did you hear about the ban on American flag t-shirts during Cinco de Mayo?
[00:37:27.914 --> 00:37:28.054]  No.
[00:37:28.074 --> 00:37:29.515]  I mean, how does that make you feel?
[00:37:29.555 --> 00:37:30.495]  I mean, we're in America, right?
[00:37:30.515 --> 00:37:31.876]  We should be able to wear whatever we want.
[00:37:32.076 --> 00:37:32.656]  Whenever we want.
[00:37:32.916 --> 00:37:33.716]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:37:33.796 --> 00:37:35.497]  Do I offend you wearing this right now?
[00:37:35.837 --> 00:37:36.297]  Not at all.
[00:37:36.718 --> 00:37:37.178]  Why is that?
[00:37:38.049 --> 00:37:38.429]  Pride.
[00:37:38.969 --> 00:37:39.610]  Pride in what?
[00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:40.190]  Country.
[00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:41.310]  Well, do you eat Mexican food?
[00:37:42.251 --> 00:37:42.891]  When I can.
[00:37:43.391 --> 00:37:45.012]  So, when you can, you're a racist?
[00:37:47.953 --> 00:37:48.333]  No, no, no.
[00:37:48.933 --> 00:37:51.314]  There's people that are saying that if you don't eat Mexican food, you're a racist.
[00:37:51.354 --> 00:37:52.475]  We think that's pretty ridiculous.
[00:37:52.895 --> 00:37:54.856]  I think they're just stupid if they don't eat it.
[00:37:55.874 --> 00:37:56.695]  I mean, it's just delicious.
[00:37:56.755 --> 00:37:58.196]  I mean, there shouldn't be anything tied to it.
[00:37:58.216 --> 00:37:59.717]  I mean, sometimes you want a taco.
[00:38:00.377 --> 00:38:08.042]  So did you hear that in California they banned the wearing of an American t-shirt such as this for the students?
[00:38:08.402 --> 00:38:13.686]  So if you had a kid in California, he went to school today wearing an American flag t-shirt, he would be sent home.
[00:38:14.466 --> 00:38:14.946]  I heard that.
[00:38:14.986 --> 00:38:16.127]  I saw that on the internet.
[00:38:16.707 --> 00:38:17.567]  That's pretty ridiculous.
[00:38:18.108 --> 00:38:18.948]  It is ridiculous.
[00:38:19.728 --> 00:38:24.790]  What are we coming to right now in this country when we can't even walk around and be patriotic and have pride for our own country?
[00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:33.114]  I think it's okay for certain people to expound certain views.
[00:38:33.294 --> 00:38:38.796]  We're not going to go to Mexico and start raising up American flags and then not expect for them to be a little teed off about that.
[00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:40.731]  Well, the only ones over there are the drug dealers.
[00:38:40.811 --> 00:38:42.331]  Everyone else is coming over here, and I don't blame them.
[00:38:42.691 --> 00:38:42.771]  Yeah.
[00:38:42.791 --> 00:38:43.532]  I don't blame them over here.
[00:38:43.612 --> 00:38:45.793]  I love Latino... Latinas.
[00:38:46.133 --> 00:38:47.073]  But anyway, that's all I'll say.
[00:38:47.093 --> 00:38:47.933]  That's a whole nother story.
[00:38:48.094 --> 00:38:48.734]  That's a whole nother story.
[00:38:48.754 --> 00:38:49.214]  Well, thank you.
[00:38:49.734 --> 00:38:50.274]  Go America.
[00:38:50.294 --> 00:38:50.935]  You guys take care.
[00:38:50.975 --> 00:38:51.355]  Rock out.
[00:38:51.815 --> 00:38:54.536]  Reaser Reports are saying that if you don't eat Mexican food, you're a racist.
[00:38:55.276 --> 00:38:56.237]  Yeah.
[00:38:56.257 --> 00:38:56.457]  No.
[00:38:56.857 --> 00:39:05.300]  Did you hear about the ban in California for students to wear American flag t-shirts on Cinco de Mayo, and that Wells Fargo has also ordered the lower of all American flags on Cinco de Mayo?
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:05.700]  Huh.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.041]  It's horrible.
[00:39:07.793 --> 00:39:08.793]  I mean, how does that make you feel?
[00:39:08.814 --> 00:39:10.014]  I mean, aren't you a proud American?
[00:39:10.254 --> 00:39:10.554]  I am.
[00:39:10.995 --> 00:39:13.636]  If I wanted to be a Mexican, I'd go to Mexico.
[00:39:13.656 --> 00:39:21.640]  Did you hear about in California that they are banning students from coming into school on today if they have an American flag t-shirt on?
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.540]  I mean, we're in America.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.941]  I mean, is that not pretty ridiculous?
[00:39:24.201 --> 00:39:25.141]  That is ridiculous.
[00:39:25.462 --> 00:39:31.585]  And did you hear that Wells Fargo lowered their flags nationwide today for Cinco de Mayo?
[00:39:31.605 --> 00:39:32.865]  I mean, we are in America.
[00:39:32.885 --> 00:39:33.986]  Why is this going on?
[00:39:35.066 --> 00:39:35.507]  I don't know.
[00:39:35.927 --> 00:39:36.287]  You tell me.
[00:39:38.028 --> 00:39:38.949]  I think it's just ridiculous.
[00:39:38.989 --> 00:39:40.830]  I mean, that's the most un-American thing that can happen.
[00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:46.475]  I mean, to be like me marching into Mexico right now on 4th of July and saying, hey, I got my flag up.
[00:39:46.515 --> 00:39:47.796]  You guys take your flag down.
[00:39:48.237 --> 00:39:48.957]  Let's meet in the middle.
[00:39:49.118 --> 00:39:50.399]  You mean, do you think they're going to fly with that?
[00:39:50.799 --> 00:39:51.019]  No.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:51.780]  Exactly.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:52.661]  Yeah.
[00:39:52.921 --> 00:39:53.842]  That's what we're out here doing.
[00:39:53.882 --> 00:39:55.643]  We're trying to figure out why they think it's OK.
[00:39:56.044 --> 00:39:59.667]  And did you know that they're going around saying that if you don't eat Mexican food, you are racist?
[00:39:59.707 --> 00:40:00.608]  How ridiculous is that?
[00:40:01.121 --> 00:40:01.882]  That's ridiculous.
[00:40:02.422 --> 00:40:03.082]  On how many levels?
[00:40:03.102 --> 00:40:03.703]  This food is spicy.
[00:40:03.863 --> 00:40:04.783]  Yeah, I mean, it's delicious.
[00:40:05.024 --> 00:40:06.244]  Some people don't like spicy food.
[00:40:06.765 --> 00:40:08.806]  I know, I mean... Personally, I love spicy food.
[00:40:09.046 --> 00:40:11.888]  But, I mean, if you don't want to eat it, then it shouldn't make you racist, alright?
[00:40:12.208 --> 00:40:12.368]  No.
[00:40:12.388 --> 00:40:13.049]  I mean, it's just food.
[00:40:13.669 --> 00:40:13.849]  Yeah.
[00:40:14.269 --> 00:40:15.650]  Do I offend you wearing this today?
[00:40:16.451 --> 00:40:17.652]  This, uh, flag?
[00:40:17.712 --> 00:40:17.912]  Yeah.
[00:40:18.352 --> 00:40:19.273]  Absolutely not.
[00:40:19.413 --> 00:40:23.776]  Wells Fargo was ordered to take down their American flag on Cinco de Mayo.
[00:40:23.796 --> 00:40:24.936]  Do you think that's a good thing or no?
[00:40:25.337 --> 00:40:26.637]  No, I don't think that's a good thing at all.
[00:40:26.677 --> 00:40:27.478]  This is America.
[00:40:27.498 --> 00:40:30.400]  We should fly the flag anytime and anywhere we wish.
[00:40:31.513 --> 00:40:38.438]  And did you also hear about the school in California that banned the wear of American flag t-shirts like this by their students?
[00:40:39.318 --> 00:40:45.482]  I think that they need to serve and realize just how important it is for people to express their right to dress however they wish.
[00:40:46.243 --> 00:40:48.164]  This is America, isn't it?
[00:40:48.724 --> 00:40:49.225]  Yes, it is.
[00:40:49.325 --> 00:40:54.288]  What is your input on the ban in California schools for students if they show up?
[00:40:56.598 --> 00:40:57.399]  The court okayed it.
[00:40:57.539 --> 00:40:58.420]  You see the article?
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:40:59.340]  Why were they banned?
[00:40:59.801 --> 00:41:10.911]  Because they said that it is controversial and brought up tension for students if they were to wear an American flag t-shirt on Cinco de Mayo.
[00:41:12.578 --> 00:41:14.799]  Um, I guess that would be their opinion.
[00:41:15.779 --> 00:41:17.740]  But, I mean, opinions don't mean anything.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.360]  We're in America.
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:26.943]  That's exactly where, to me, as a former military person, I believe that their opinion is their American right.
[00:41:27.264 --> 00:41:31.745]  If they want to lower their flags or whatever they want to do, I believe that it is their right to do.
[00:41:31.965 --> 00:41:33.046]  That's their freedom of speech.
[00:41:34.124 --> 00:41:44.508]  They can't force us, but if their choice is to lower it for whatever reason they feel is necessary, then I think that there's a lot of people overseas who would respect that opinion.
[00:41:44.848 --> 00:41:49.851]  Whether it's ours or not, I think the United States has the right to decide what they want because of that.
[00:41:50.011 --> 00:41:57.734]  Well, we were wondering what people think about schools mandating that you can't wear an American flag t-shirt on Cinco de Mayo.
[00:42:00.038 --> 00:42:06.483]  I think they shouldn't teach children that young to feel that kind of way about anything as far as the flag or anything else.
[00:42:07.043 --> 00:42:07.964]  Like, that's their choice.
[00:42:08.004 --> 00:42:09.665]  If they want to wear it, they should be able to.
[00:42:09.685 --> 00:42:10.166]  Right.
[00:42:10.406 --> 00:42:19.233]  What do you think about the court upheld that decision and said it didn't violate their First Amendment right to make the children not wear the American flag t-shirt?
[00:42:19.673 --> 00:42:20.454]  Does this offend you?
[00:42:21.074 --> 00:42:23.836]  Yes, because that is what the Constitution's about.
[00:42:23.856 --> 00:42:27.559]  Does it offend you that this man is... Not at all.
[00:42:28.638 --> 00:42:29.158]  Why would it?
[00:42:29.198 --> 00:42:30.639]  We're standing right here with him.
[00:42:30.679 --> 00:42:31.660]  Why would it offend us?
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:32.400]  We'd walk off.
[00:42:33.401 --> 00:42:38.724]  Why do you think Americans are the only ones that are trying to figure out how we can stitch together all of our flags?
[00:42:38.784 --> 00:42:40.665]  Why is it wrong for Americans to be patriotic?
[00:42:40.685 --> 00:42:42.006]  I think it's a generalization though.
[00:42:42.046 --> 00:42:48.950]  I'm sure there's a Mexican guy just like me walking along with aviators on going, I wonder if we can stitch an American flag and a Mexican flag together.
[00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:51.592]  There's so many people in the world, you know, you can't really generalize.
[00:42:52.112 --> 00:42:55.534]  You know, around the corner you might meet someone exactly the same as you or completely opposites.
[00:42:55.674 --> 00:43:09.025]  Well, and I agree on our basic level we are all the same, but are you aware of any other countries that have this thing where they're trying to just please everyone of every other culture and taking away their patriotism?
[00:43:11.527 --> 00:43:12.908]  I mean... Name one country.
[00:43:13.449 --> 00:43:14.730]  That's trying to include everyone?
[00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:22.216]  Name one country that is going to lower their flags in praise of a holiday that they don't even actually celebrate in Mexico.
[00:43:26.491 --> 00:43:27.912]  I guess I couldn't off the top of my head.
[00:43:28.032 --> 00:43:28.472]  I don't know.
[00:43:29.032 --> 00:43:29.992]  Maybe Canadians though?
[00:43:30.212 --> 00:43:30.513]  I don't know.
[00:43:30.633 --> 00:43:31.193]  Can we count them in?
[00:43:31.533 --> 00:43:32.874]  But I don't know what they do it for.
[00:43:32.894 --> 00:43:35.835]  But, honestly, it's more for the money here.
[00:43:35.975 --> 00:43:36.875]  That's why.
[00:43:36.955 --> 00:43:38.396]  They sell drinks that way, so.
[00:43:38.536 --> 00:43:38.756]  Yeah.
[00:43:38.776 --> 00:43:39.556]  It is what it is.
[00:43:39.816 --> 00:43:41.497]  Hi, this is Cinco de Mayo today, are you aware?
[00:43:41.697 --> 00:43:41.917]  Yes.
[00:43:42.297 --> 00:43:42.897]  Cool.
[00:43:43.157 --> 00:43:44.698]  Does this item offend you today?
[00:43:45.198 --> 00:43:45.338]  No.
[00:43:46.199 --> 00:43:46.419]  Good.
[00:43:47.079 --> 00:43:47.499]  Why is that?
[00:43:48.499 --> 00:43:50.980]  That never offends me.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.161]  Even on Cinco de Mayo though?
[00:43:52.381 --> 00:43:52.801]  It doesn't.
[00:43:53.041 --> 00:43:55.142]  You know, some people might think that's racist.
[00:43:56.056 --> 00:43:56.697]  I understand.
[00:43:57.117 --> 00:44:06.049]  What do you think about, I feel like a lot of times with holidays and stuff, it seems like in America on just like a basic level people are coming together.
[00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:08.412]  It's getting less racist, you know, less...
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:10.141]  We're good.
[00:44:29.531 --> 00:44:39.633]  I mean, we've always been a diverse country, so to limit anybody on saying anything, whether it's fiesta or an American word or whatever it is, I mean, we have always been a melting pot.
[00:44:39.693 --> 00:44:41.433]  You know, we have tons of different cultures.
[00:44:41.854 --> 00:44:56.497]  Generation after generation, people have been coming, and I think that that's one of the best things about our country, is that we should be able to celebrate everybody's ethnicity and different cultural beliefs, and you know, I mean, that's the good thing about the United States, and so to try to limit that or take that away is just ridiculous.
[00:44:57.137 --> 00:44:58.417]  I'm here to ask if
[00:44:59.824 --> 00:45:03.105]  I'm here on Cinco de Mayo if this American flag offends you.
[00:45:03.665 --> 00:45:06.646]  This American flag does not offend me, not one bit.
[00:45:06.786 --> 00:45:07.566]  And why is that, sir?
[00:45:07.826 --> 00:45:09.426]  Because I'm an American and I'm proud of it.
[00:45:09.987 --> 00:45:13.908]  You know in California they ban kids from wearing American flags on Cinco de Mayo, right?
[00:45:14.428 --> 00:45:15.348]  I'm offended by that.
[00:45:16.008 --> 00:45:24.770]  What do you think the USA's agenda is in lowering flags and telling people that their flag shirts are offensive and the court upholds that?
[00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:27.291]  What do you think is the agenda there?
[00:45:27.921 --> 00:45:29.883]  In all honesty, I don't know the court case.
[00:45:30.163 --> 00:45:33.086]  I can't make an intelligent response to that.
[00:45:33.166 --> 00:45:34.487]  I don't know what prompted it.
[00:45:35.228 --> 00:45:40.993]  But as far as agendas, I was making reference to them doing their own country thing, their cultural thing.
[00:45:41.394 --> 00:45:45.978]  I think as far as us being in America, I think our ability to do whatever we want.
[00:45:46.559 --> 00:45:46.879]  And as
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:53.522]  Personally, as opposed to it as I am, that goes and even as far as flag burning.
[00:45:54.162 --> 00:45:58.604]  I would fight for somebody's ability to do that in this country as their First Amendment right.
[00:45:58.964 --> 00:46:06.628]  I think freedom of speech should be given to anybody and everybody in this country, whether we agree with their opinion or not, because not everybody agrees with ours.
[00:46:07.588 --> 00:46:12.830]  We want to ask you guys today if you are offended by this item on Cinco de Mayo.
[00:46:14.471 --> 00:46:14.971]  What is it?
[00:46:15.985 --> 00:46:18.126]  Uh, it's just a rolled up American flag here.
[00:46:18.146 --> 00:46:22.049]  Uh, I am not offended by the American flag.
[00:46:22.649 --> 00:46:26.792]  You traitors, claiming I'm a Ruski agent, say it to my face and I'll break your nose.
[00:46:27.032 --> 00:46:27.692]  I'm sick of it.
[00:46:27.932 --> 00:46:42.441]  I will stomp your head in the ground, you traitorous maggots, while we go under Obamacare, North American Union, conquered by European banks, announcing our kids don't belong to us, total bondage, total surveillance, and you want to shoot your mouth off about me being a Ruski agent?
[00:46:42.681 --> 00:46:44.382]  I will stomp your head in the ground.
[00:46:44.622 --> 00:46:50.370]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:54.695]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:46:56.217 --> 00:47:01.885]  I wish we'd go back to the days, I'm telling you, of getting my satisfaction out in the street.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:07.462]  Get Brain Force at 25% off for a limited time at Infowarslife.com.
[00:47:07.602 --> 00:47:09.783]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.903 --> 00:47:16.706]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:16.946 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.408]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.

[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.701]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.

[00:49:07.839 --> 00:49:11.280]  Obama's arrogant lecturing barely works in the United States.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:15.541]  What made him think it would work on an entirely different country?
[00:49:15.761 --> 00:49:20.062]  I figured you might want to hear from the President of the United States what I think the United States is going to do.
[00:49:20.742 --> 00:49:34.185]  Maybe some point down the line there might be a UK-US trade agreement, but it's not going to happen anytime soon because our focus is in negotiating with a big block, the European Union, to get a trade agreement done.
[00:49:34.645 --> 00:49:41.366]  The outcome of that decision is a matter of deep interest to the United States because it affects our prospects as well.
[00:49:41.927 --> 00:49:58.790]  After Obama made his allegiance to the dark side abundantly clear, Alex Massey of The Spectator wrote, The reaction to Barack Obama's remarks yesterday in which he suggested that Brexit campaigners were not being wholly straight with the British people has been as remarkable as it has been depressing.
[00:49:58.910 --> 00:50:01.270]  How dare Obama insult Britain like this?
[00:50:01.711 --> 00:50:03.751]  How dare he threaten the British people?
[00:50:03.991 --> 00:50:07.576]  Why has Britain allowed itself to be humiliated in this fashion?
[00:50:07.696 --> 00:50:09.619]  And who is this guy to talk anyway?
[00:50:09.779 --> 00:50:15.448]  He's just a jumped-up, half-Kenyan, lame-duck president whose record is nothing to celebrate anyway.
[00:50:15.608 --> 00:50:16.389]  Yaboo!
[00:50:16.509 --> 00:50:18.773]  Sucks to be you, Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:50:18.973 --> 00:50:20.315]  You know nothing.
[00:50:20.495 --> 00:50:25.238]  The United States government, I'm sure, thinks it doesn't want Britain to leave the EU.
[00:50:25.398 --> 00:50:26.479]  Now, why would that be?
[00:50:26.959 --> 00:50:28.961]  We are their voice in Europe.
[00:50:29.061 --> 00:50:37.787]  This is something that has to be decided on the basis of what is good for Britain, what is good for Britain economically, and what is good for Britain politically.
[00:50:38.247 --> 00:50:40.909]  Actually, our democracy is being eroded.
[00:50:41.229 --> 00:50:48.634]  We are creating a monster in Europe that's not answerable to public opinion, which will, in the end, end in disaster.
[00:50:48.934 --> 00:51:12.828]  Five laws out of every six that are made in the United Kingdom and inflicted upon us are made because the unelected commissars of the European Union who have the sole right to propose legislation for the whole of Europe, and that legislation takes precedence over all our own domestic legislation, they have to do what the commissars tell us to do.
[00:51:12.929 --> 00:51:14.830]  Commissar is the official German name
[00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:23.132]  For the 30 people who behind closed doors run Europe, they have absolute power, enormous wealth and no responsibility.
[00:51:23.512 --> 00:51:28.493]  These are the people who now dictate to us what our laws shall be.
[00:51:28.773 --> 00:51:34.034]  Ultimately this is something that the British voters have to decide for themselves.
[00:51:35.075 --> 00:51:40.296]  But as part of our special relationship, part of being friends,
[00:51:41.616 --> 00:51:45.817]  Is to be honest, and to let you know what I think.
[00:51:46.378 --> 00:51:52.740]  Let me be clear, when it comes to the special relationship between our two countries, there's no greater enthusiast than me.
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:52:04.884]  I'm very proud to have had the opportunity to be Prime Minister and to stand outside the White House, listening to this man, my friend Barack, say that the special relationship between our countries has never been stronger.
[00:52:05.964 --> 00:52:12.266]  But I've never felt constrained in any way in strengthening this relationship by the fact that we're in the European Union.
[00:52:12.907 --> 00:52:14.027]  In fact, quite the reverse.
[00:52:15.287 --> 00:52:18.769]  We deliver for our people through all the international groups that we're part of.
[00:52:19.568 --> 00:52:22.230]  We enhance our security through the membership of NATO.
[00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:26.353]  We further our prosperity through the G7 and the G20.
[00:52:27.013 --> 00:52:39.363]  And like those organisations, Britain's membership of the EU gives us a powerful tool to deliver on the prosperity and security that our people need, and to stand up for the values that our countries share.
[00:52:40.143 --> 00:52:45.865]  Obama's New World Order bedfellow, Prime Minister David Cameron, now has his hands full.
[00:52:46.086 --> 00:52:50.387]  The Conservatives were re-elected in the general election held in May of 2015.
[00:52:50.647 --> 00:53:00.611]  Cameron held true his pledge that if the Conservatives were re-elected, the terms of Britain's EU membership would be renegotiated and a vote on the Brexit would be held.
[00:53:00.772 --> 00:53:09.035]  However, Cameron's renegotiation with EU Council President Donald Tusk has been criticized as being nothing less than political theater.
[00:53:09.676 --> 00:53:12.078]  So you were disappointed really?
[00:53:12.118 --> 00:53:14.120]  You were disappointed with what the Prime Minister actually said?
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:20.186]  Look, I don't think that the agreement as it stands actually reverses or changes anything dramatically.
[00:53:20.786 --> 00:53:23.669]  But that's not to be churlish about.
[00:53:23.709 --> 00:53:29.274]  There were some successes and I think it is a success to a degree to get any kind of change from the European Union.
[00:53:29.314 --> 00:53:33.538]  But let's not get this, it's been sold as this great moment of change.
[00:53:33.618 --> 00:53:43.681]  Meanwhile, the actors in England are changing, as the Labour Party is projected to possibly lose more seats than it did in 1982, as reported by The Telegraph.
[00:53:43.981 --> 00:53:50.944]  Great Britain never totally submerged itself into the Bilderberg brainchild's poison known as the European Union.
[00:53:51.184 --> 00:53:54.305]  Britain opted out of the EU monetary policy.
[00:53:54.545 --> 00:54:01.208]  The pound is alive and trading nervously as the Brexit vote is favoured by 45% of voters.
[00:54:01.649 --> 00:54:05.851]  Also, Britain doesn't share open borders like the rest of the EU.
[00:54:06.171 --> 00:54:13.355]  Of course, tell that to the 83,000 illegal immigrants claiming asylum in the UK as was reported by the Express recently.
[00:54:13.495 --> 00:54:15.316]  We've lost control of our borders.
[00:54:16.056 --> 00:54:22.207]  Net migration into Britain is now running at 10 times the post-war average.
[00:54:22.908 --> 00:54:27.736]  And that's if you believe the official figures, which frankly, I don't.
[00:54:28.953 --> 00:54:35.799]  We have to build a new house in this country every seven minutes just to cope with current levels of immigration.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:48.570]  As the Brexit winds down to its June 23rd deadline, expect to see Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland demanding their own say in the fate of the EU's sovereign swallowing hold over the United Kingdom.
[00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:50.912]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:54:57.927 --> 00:55:02.791]  As a community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.
[00:55:05.673 --> 00:55:14.360]  That's veteran Denver Police Officer Charles Jones IV smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:19.224]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect and then trying to erase the evidence.
[00:55:19.264 --> 00:55:21.946]  I'm observing what they're doing and they're overtaking me.
[00:55:21.966 --> 00:55:23.807]  I don't understand what's going on.
[00:55:23.827 --> 00:55:26.790]  A community rates low on an information scale.
[00:55:27.569 --> 00:55:33.566]  When the press, radio, and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[00:55:34.449 --> 00:55:41.935]  Does it raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government?
[00:55:42.175 --> 00:55:43.436]  How can you ask such a question?
[00:55:43.476 --> 00:55:46.638]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:55:46.658 --> 00:55:53.763]  When a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in a community, he looks beyond fine words and noble phrases.
[00:55:53.783 --> 00:56:01.409]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.661]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[00:56:04.761 --> 00:56:06.482]  When I say go, see?
[00:56:07.303 --> 00:56:08.724]  I'm the law around here!
[00:56:08.744 --> 00:56:13.766]  You came, you saw, you died.
[00:56:16.477 --> 00:56:19.579]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[00:56:46.333 --> 00:56:52.437]  Nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[00:56:52.657 --> 00:56:53.158]  Okay, Ms.
[00:56:53.198 --> 00:56:57.580]  Hughes, well, we're gonna do everything we can to help you.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.983]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:57:01.563 --> 00:57:04.084]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:04.265 --> 00:57:07.166]  Because there is a war on, in your mind.
[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:29.211]  You know, with all this talk lately about gun control, it occurred to me that I have yet to see a single politician who can explain to me how they plan to take guns away from the criminal thugs who are out there on the streets right now.
[00:57:29.872 --> 00:57:36.317]  Oh sure, you'll hear plenty of talk about how they plan to take guns away from us, us law-abiding citizens.
[00:57:36.997 --> 00:57:45.460]  But if you take guns away from all of us legal gun owners, then the only people that will have guns will be the bad guys.
[00:57:46.121 --> 00:57:47.341]  In fact, I'm curious.
[00:57:47.741 --> 00:57:49.502]  I want to see a show of hands right now.
[00:57:49.862 --> 00:57:51.943]  All those for gun control, raise your hands.
[00:57:52.523 --> 00:57:55.324]  Alright, there's one, two, three, four.
[00:57:56.265 --> 00:57:56.745]  Anyone else?
[00:57:58.766 --> 00:58:00.126]  Ah, see there, that figures.
[00:58:00.667 --> 00:58:02.007]  All the usual suspects.
[00:58:03.168 --> 00:58:03.748]  Any questions?
[00:58:13.626 --> 00:58:20.348]  Hey, I want to remind our audience that there will be another Trump rally tomorrow in Eugene, Oregon.
[00:58:20.888 --> 00:58:26.750]  And it'll be at the Lane Events Convention Center at the fair, 7 o'clock p.m.
[00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:29.250]  Doors open at 4 o'clock p.m.

[00:58:33.931 --> 00:58:35.492]  The InfoWars crew will be there.
[00:58:36.152 --> 00:58:39.053]  And that means Joe Biggs and myself.
[00:58:39.353 --> 00:58:41.354]  We will both be going to Oregon tomorrow.
[00:58:41.634 --> 00:58:45.515]  We look forward to meeting all of you and let's go trigger happy!
[00:58:45.895 --> 00:58:49.016]  Together we can trigger some social justice warriors.
[00:58:49.716 --> 00:58:51.517]  And that's going to do it for tonight's broadcast.
[00:58:51.577 --> 00:58:55.818]  EM4's Nightly News will return tomorrow night at 7 o'clock p.m.
[00:58:55.898 --> 00:58:56.318]  Central.
[00:58:56.338 --> 00:58:57.839]  Until then, have a good night.
[00:58:58.359 --> 00:58:58.759]  We'll see you.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.001]  Knockout is back.
[00:59:05.341 --> 00:59:16.447]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep, restful sleep, Knockout's it.

[00:59:28.573 --> 00:59:30.334]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:30.894 --> 00:59:31.775]  It's the same price
[00:59:32.495 --> 00:59:41.380]  As leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece, it has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult, and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
