[00:00:20.168 --> 00:00:22.049]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.052]  It is Thursday, June 16th, 2016, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:27.093]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:37.680]  Tonight, the Craigslist advertisement that suggests a new domestic terror plot.
[00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:46.607]  Then, Hillary condemns other countries for how they spend their money, but she has no issue accepting the funds for herself.
[00:00:47.677 --> 00:00:58.308]  After that, the CIA admits that loose immigration policy aids the plot of extremists and the epic debate between facts and talking points.
[00:00:59.048 --> 00:00:59.709]  That's next.
[00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.951]  That's sad.
[00:01:04.974 --> 00:01:05.975]  That's real sad.
[00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:07.237]  He's against you.
[00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:11.566]  Why would you support a racist?
[00:01:11.626 --> 00:01:14.787]  He's going to send you back to Africa.
[00:01:14.827 --> 00:01:15.688]  That's what he said.
[00:01:15.888 --> 00:01:20.190]  He said send Mexicans back to Mexico.
[00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.572]  You are a disgrace to America for being a young black man supporting a racist.
[00:01:30.196 --> 00:01:37.701]  Buckley, tell us about Alexa Pure Breeze, discounted over 25% off as an introductory promotion.
[00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:39.042]  It's the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:42.984]  It's an energy-efficient HEPA ion cluster air purification system.
[00:01:43.364 --> 00:01:45.806]  It has a four-stage purification process.
[00:01:45.946 --> 00:01:49.228]  It has a HEPA filter, pre-filters, and a carbon-activated filters.
[00:01:49.488 --> 00:01:58.971]  And the most amazing thing about it is that it has this patented ion cluster technology that kills airborne microbes with a final byproduct of clean water, not ozone.
[00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:10.674]  Because there's a lot of units out there that do that, that will sterilize the air, that will take out toxins and microbes, but you always come back into the room and you have that ozone smell, and as a matter of fact, if you leave a room sealed and you have one of those running... Toxin!
[00:02:10.854 --> 00:02:12.435]  It is toxic and it's kind of dangerous.
[00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:14.336]  So this is non-toxic.
[00:02:14.496 --> 00:02:15.577]  It's a beautiful unit.
[00:02:15.877 --> 00:02:16.717]  It really looks good.
[00:02:16.757 --> 00:02:18.679]  I mean, it will look beautiful in your house in a corner.
[00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.521]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, which operates as a fan.
[00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:23.501]  It's super quiet.
[00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:24.462]  It cleans the air.
[00:02:24.982 --> 00:02:27.624]  Every major room in your house really should have one of these.
[00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:41.113]  The cheapest equivalent unit costs $259.95 and there are other units that are up to $899 to $1,000 to do exactly what this unit does but they're not as quiet because this one has a silent mode which runs at 16 decibels.
[00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:46.636]  One thing that I encourage everybody to do is go and just look up online the toxicity of being inside all the time.
[00:02:46.876 --> 00:02:50.039]  In this current age, we're inside the vast majority of the time.
[00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.020]  Hardly do we ever get outside in the sun.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.282]  We're usually out inside doing something in our office or at home.
[00:03:02.345 --> 00:03:20.073]  Well, fresh off of President Obama's epic takedown of Donald Trump, whereby he just proved that he's more upset about Republican rhetoric than he is about actual terrorism, now we have John McCain coming out and saying, you know what, Obama is directly responsible for the Orlando attack.
[00:03:20.113 --> 00:03:22.214]  So he took it even a step further than Donald Trump.
[00:03:22.954 --> 00:03:34.866]  So, Senator John McCain was talking to a group of reporters and he did say President Obama was directly responsible for the terror attack in Orlando due to his failure to combat the rise of the Islamic State terror group.
[00:03:35.587 --> 00:03:41.253]  He said Barack Obama was told, you know, before he pulled everybody out of Iraq, Al Qaeda went to Syria.
[00:03:41.653 --> 00:03:42.033]  Thank you.
[00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:58.119]  Ooh, indeed.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:13.307]  And giving a little bit more weight to that argument, now Breitbart is reporting on a memo that was received by then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton shows that the Obama administration aided the group that became ISIS to control the area where ISIS formed the caliphate.
[00:04:13.727 --> 00:04:16.850]  Now, this is a secret classified intelligence report.
[00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.352]  It was sent to Hillary Clinton and other top U.S.
[00:04:19.372 --> 00:04:21.434]  officials in August of 2012.
[00:04:21.714 --> 00:04:31.623]  The report confirmed that Western and Gulf states were joining with Turkey to support the Syrian opposition to dictator Bashar al-Assad.
[00:04:32.023 --> 00:04:39.250]  Now, the report confirmed that the Syrian opposition was being led by three groups, including al-Qaeda in Iraq, which later became ISIS.
[00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:48.795]  Now the report confirmed that Al Qaeda in Iraq was communicating through spokesman Al Adnani, who is now the chief spokesman for ISIS.
[00:04:49.275 --> 00:05:00.061]  So Western and Gulf states helped the Syrian opposition groups to control the Syria-Iraq border, and this is of course where ISIS leader violently formed its caliphate.
[00:05:00.661 --> 00:05:04.785]  And the report noted the potential for safe havens under international sheltering.
[00:05:04.945 --> 00:05:07.447]  This is similar to what happened in Libya.
[00:05:07.987 --> 00:05:14.392]  And all of the areas that are cited in this memo have now become the sites of ongoing ISIS terror occupation.
[00:05:14.793 --> 00:05:20.938]  So this is a memo that was received by Hillary Clinton about a month before the attacks in Benghazi.
[00:05:21.558 --> 00:05:29.925]  And Eric Prince, who was the founder of the global security firm Blackwater, told Breitbart News about the fact that the Obama administration was using
[00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:36.648]  It's Benghazi consulate in relation to sending weapons to the Syrian opposition groups.
[00:05:37.568 --> 00:05:39.049]  And I know we've reported on that as well.
[00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:44.812]  And so of course, one month later, that consulate was attacked after Hillary Clinton received the documents.
[00:05:46.252 --> 00:05:47.673]  And that's not all.
[00:05:47.993 --> 00:05:57.699]  So now we know that the nations that Clinton came out earlier this week, she was bashing several nations for terrorism funding and she said, you know, we've got to take these out.
[00:05:57.739 --> 00:06:05.163]  Well, it turns out they were directly funding another person who wants to hurt this country, Clinton herself.
[00:06:05.963 --> 00:06:14.289]  And the trio of nations that were named by Hillary Clinton contributed between 16 and 40 million dollars to the Clinton Foundation.
[00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:25.417]  So during her speech she said, for starters, it's long past time for the Saudis, the Qataris and the Kuwaitis and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations.
[00:06:25.877 --> 00:06:29.520]  They should stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world.
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.220]  I don't know.
[00:06:55.928 --> 00:06:57.469]  Why should we criticize them?
[00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:06.734]  Shouldn't we be criticizing you for, you know, once again, she doesn't also speak out about the fact that they're chopping off women's heads and treat women worse than they would a parakeet.
[00:07:06.914 --> 00:07:16.759]  So, and just to give you a little bit more stories to show you that they know exactly what they're doing when they're creating order out of chaos.
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:24.383]  Now the CIA chief has come out to say the Islamic State is working to send operatives to the West and they might be exploiting the
[00:07:25.644 --> 00:07:26.525]  Immigration issue.
[00:07:26.825 --> 00:07:27.085]  Hmm.
[00:07:27.345 --> 00:07:27.686]  Duh.
[00:07:27.886 --> 00:07:29.807]  We've been telling you that for quite some time.
[00:07:30.267 --> 00:07:32.069]  So this is CIA Director John Brennan.
[00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:38.713]  He told Congress that state militants are training and attempting to deploy operatives for further attacks on the West.
[00:07:39.093 --> 00:07:44.057]  They'll rely more on guerrilla style tactics to compensate for their territorial losses.
[00:07:44.517 --> 00:07:54.204]  He said Islamic State is probably working to smuggle them into countries, perhaps among refugee flows or through legitimate means of travel.
[00:07:54.924 --> 00:08:10.567]  So, of course, that means they're going to be tightening security, looking for these so-called lone wolves and things to be springing up in the West, knowing that they're being shipped in, knowing that they're already coming across the border, knowing that they're going to be exploiting the refugee crisis.
[00:08:10.887 --> 00:08:12.047]  But are they doing anything about that?
[00:08:12.488 --> 00:08:13.728]  No.
[00:08:13.748 --> 00:08:16.628]  441 Syrian refugees have been admitted to the U.S.
[00:08:17.028 --> 00:08:18.689]  since the Orlando attacks.
[00:08:18.729 --> 00:08:19.749]  It hasn't even been a week.
[00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:21.693]  So that's nearly 500 people.
[00:08:22.054 --> 00:08:25.042]  Imagine how many people have been coming in the weeks prior to this.
[00:08:25.423 --> 00:08:28.270]  Dozens of those Syrian refugees have been sent to Florida.
[00:08:29.528 --> 00:08:49.118]  And according to a new polling data from Reuters, it shows that support for a temporary ban on any Muslim entering the United States is that there's a surge in the amount of likely voters who are actually beginning to support this temporary ban because people can see, no, this is not racist and it's not political incorrectness.
[00:08:49.618 --> 00:08:55.381]  We need to start taking care of our own country and considering what we're doing when we are
[00:08:56.541 --> 00:09:03.522]  Well, bombing up all of these other countries out there that are turning against the West and then bringing these people in who hate us.
[00:09:03.942 --> 00:09:04.643]  It's ridiculous.
[00:09:05.223 --> 00:09:08.763]  And you would think that they would do that, but that's really not the plan.
[00:09:08.843 --> 00:09:12.264]  The plan is to turn this country into a police state.
[00:09:12.584 --> 00:09:19.085]  It's to allow them to bring all of these people into our country and terrorize us so that we all ask to be protected.
[00:09:19.445 --> 00:09:22.726]  Because as we're going to see, they're going to be ramping up the amount of
[00:09:23.106 --> 00:09:35.280]  TSA presence as well as security that you're going to be seeing all throughout the summer after these attacks at concerts, football games, baseball games, any kind of sports games that you're heading to, travelers.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.005]  You're going to be seeing a ramp up in security screening as well because
[00:09:40.966 --> 00:09:51.110]  They're really concerned about homegrown violent extremists and that was a narrative they really pushed out with this most recent attack that this guy was a US citizen.
[00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.231]  He was born in New York.
[00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:54.131]  So this is homegrown terrorism.
[00:09:54.191 --> 00:09:54.992]  He's a lone wolf.
[00:09:55.292 --> 00:10:02.715]  We already well documented how his ideologies were imported by his father and by getting radicalized online.
[00:10:03.615 --> 00:10:06.176]  As well, he traveled to Saudi Arabia several times.
[00:10:06.276 --> 00:10:11.517]  So this was an imported ideology, but we're going to be seeing a lot more of that happening in the future.
[00:10:12.057 --> 00:10:15.718]  But they're going to police all of us because of political correctness.
[00:10:16.298 --> 00:10:22.240]  And they're really talking about the fact that this environment, even with
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.582]  Where we can clearly see what's happening.
[00:10:24.922 --> 00:10:33.048]  They're particularly concerned about home homegrown violent extremists, including and really concerning right wing extremists.
[00:10:33.809 --> 00:10:35.130]  So what do they want to do?
[00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.472]  Tell us to give up our guns.
[00:10:38.532 --> 00:10:39.793]  This is Jay Johnson.
[00:10:39.813 --> 00:10:41.795]  Matt Drudge tweeted out earlier.
[00:10:41.955 --> 00:10:42.816]  He said, you know what?
[00:10:42.896 --> 00:10:44.397]  Give up your guns first, buddy.
[00:10:44.857 --> 00:10:45.738]  But that's their plan.
[00:10:46.198 --> 00:10:49.680]  They can see like, look everywhere, there's terror all around you, it's not safe.
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.042]  But we'll protect you, so give up your guns.
[00:10:52.182 --> 00:10:55.323]  We will put the police and the TSA everywhere you go.
[00:10:55.404 --> 00:10:56.344]  We'll take care of it.
[00:10:56.384 --> 00:10:57.085]  We'll protect you.
[00:10:57.525 --> 00:10:59.006]  You don't need to protect yourself.
[00:10:59.086 --> 00:11:00.747]  And we're really seeing a doubling down.
[00:11:00.867 --> 00:11:01.887]  It's like insanity.
[00:11:02.348 --> 00:11:14.395]  Coming up later in the show, I'm going to be talking with David Knight about what's going on in Venezuela as a perfect example of why we need to not listen to this government when they tell us that everything's going to be fine as long as we give them
[00:11:15.015 --> 00:11:15.856]  All of our guns.
[00:11:16.036 --> 00:11:17.056]  They'll create peace.
[00:11:17.156 --> 00:11:18.097]  They'll take care of us.
[00:11:18.137 --> 00:11:19.698]  That is a huge trick.
[00:11:19.898 --> 00:11:22.659]  It's a trap and we cannot fall victim to it.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:31.084]  Now, President Obama's plan, of course, is to abruptly take Second Amendment rights away from everyone.
[00:11:31.584 --> 00:11:39.789]  And also, we have our own police chief here from Austin, Texas, Art Acevedo, who was at one of these DHS meetings.
[00:11:40.169 --> 00:11:47.013]  Who really, you know, spoke up to remind the council, hey, hey, you know, it's not just these Islamic extremists.
[00:11:47.053 --> 00:11:51.435]  We also really need to be worried about right-wing extremists domestically.
[00:11:51.575 --> 00:11:54.937]  That's just as real as the threat from Islamic extremism.
[00:11:54.997 --> 00:11:56.878]  So, good job Art Acevedo.
[00:11:56.898 --> 00:11:59.680]  Guess we won't be having you back in the office anytime soon.
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.600]  Or maybe we will.
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.221]  Maybe you can come
[00:12:01.841 --> 00:12:02.922]  Explain yourself.
[00:12:03.502 --> 00:12:16.812]  But even with all of this rhetoric and what we're seeing in the media, I believe it was reported that the loudest claps at the vigil for the Orlando victims was when they said, we need to support the Muslim community.
[00:12:16.892 --> 00:12:17.552]  We need to this.
[00:12:17.652 --> 00:12:18.893]  And so they're like, yay.
[00:12:18.953 --> 00:12:19.354]  Yes.
[00:12:19.834 --> 00:12:21.115]  Love conquers hate.
[00:12:21.495 --> 00:12:21.976]  Yeah.
[00:12:22.276 --> 00:12:28.980]  But even with that agenda that we're seeing being pushed out, people are breaking through the conditioning and we're actually seeing a
[00:12:30.081 --> 00:12:52.992]  Gun sales surge among the LGBTQ community because they know what's going on even when you tell them Oh, this is not what you need They can see that it's time for them to start protecting themselves A lot of arms dealers are reporting three to four times what they normally see they said it was expected they weren't surprised by the sales surge because it's similar to what happened after Sandy Hook and
[00:12:53.332 --> 00:12:53.652]  I think so.
[00:13:16.858 --> 00:13:20.021]  A week or so ago where everyone was out there celebrating Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:20.041 --> 00:13:25.565]  It was like the only place we could find a massive amount of number of people that were just celebrating Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:28.527]  The streets were painted rainbow flag.
[00:13:28.607 --> 00:13:36.293]  I mean, but now if we were out there now, we would be so surprised to see that their West Hollywood has been inundated
[00:13:36.713 --> 00:13:41.637]  With pro-gun, pro-gay posters and these are popping up everywhere in West Hollywood.
[00:13:41.957 --> 00:13:49.062]  It's a gay version of the Gadsden flag featuring a rattlesnake on top of the gay rainbow with the hashtag shoot back.
[00:13:49.502 --> 00:14:03.212]  So we're gonna start seeing this more proactive approach to self-defense in the gay community and indeed you know they need it because now investigators are the police are looking into a Craigslist ad that was posted
[00:14:03.772 --> 00:14:06.854]  Threatening more Orlando-style massacres in San Diego.
[00:14:06.994 --> 00:14:09.495]  So this is just someone who's going to post something anonymously.
[00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:11.857]  So they're looking in to see where it came from.
[00:14:11.917 --> 00:14:13.558]  But, you know, active threats.
[00:14:14.198 --> 00:14:28.327]  And a gun range here in Texas, the Shiloh Gun Range, which is just on the outskirts of Houston, is actually saying that their classes, they were offering free classes, free courses for members of the LGBT community.
[00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:51.172]  And it's been so popular since the Orlando attacks that they're actually having to increase that, offering even more classes, and they're recommending that gun ranges across the country start doing this to educate people and make this community, who probably used to not really feel very welcome at a gun range, thinking, well, we don't fit in here, letting them know that this is 3.8% of the population
[00:14:53.052 --> 00:14:57.953]  That we need to tap into to let them understand the importance of the Second Amendment.
[00:14:58.333 --> 00:15:08.036]  Whereas you see on the left, they're trying to get that 3.8% of the population to give up the guns and to fight for tighter gun regulations and things.
[00:15:08.076 --> 00:15:10.036]  So I think we're breaking through the conditioning there.
[00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.297]  People are starting to really see what's going on.
[00:15:13.397 --> 00:15:24.090]  Now, this is something that happened that, when I saw this at first, I'm thinking, why is the former head of the CIA starting to sound like he's listening to InfoWars?
[00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:29.957]  Because he's talking about the fact that political correctness is hampering the anti-terror strategy.
[00:15:31.338 --> 00:15:36.180]  This is former director of the CIA and the NSA, General Michael Hayden.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:45.905]  He was appearing on CNN and he warned that political correctness has become a significant hindrance when it comes to countering the threats of Muslim extremism.
[00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:46.765]  We've said that as well.
[00:15:47.285 --> 00:16:00.271]  He went on to point out how in Fort Hood, the army knew that Nidal Hassan had become extremist, but they whitewashed all of his reports to make it sound as though it was a good thing that he had all this knowledge because they didn't want to be called bigots.
[00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:03.573]  They didn't want to have to deal with someone's religious freedom there.
[00:16:04.913 --> 00:16:07.654]  But then you kind of see where he's going with this.
[00:16:08.355 --> 00:16:10.916]  It's not about taking away the political correctness.
[00:16:11.076 --> 00:16:12.477]  It's almost countering that.
[00:16:13.177 --> 00:16:16.280]  Well, we don't care if we offend you at all.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.340]  It's free speech.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.301]  We're going to offend everybody.
[00:16:18.341 --> 00:16:20.643]  But now it's constitutional correctness.
[00:16:21.103 --> 00:16:23.525]  Now they're just going to say, hey, you know what?
[00:16:23.806 --> 00:16:25.407]  We're not going to be politically correct.
[00:16:25.507 --> 00:16:27.248]  We have to look for terrorists.
[00:16:27.549 --> 00:16:32.312]  And don't forget, anyone can be labeled a terrorist and put on this terrorist no-fly list.
[00:16:32.793 --> 00:16:34.854]  And you won't even know how to get your name taken off of there.
[00:16:35.655 --> 00:16:40.177]  But he's, Jake Tapper is asking him, do you want to just go right into their Facebook account?
[00:16:40.197 --> 00:16:43.319]  Do you want to get access to their emails, to their phone, to all of this?
[00:16:43.939 --> 00:16:52.003]  And then he goes on to say, well, there was a national outcry that the National Counterterrorism Center had too many people on the no-fly list.
[00:16:52.543 --> 00:16:55.904]  But then by Christmas night, the complaint was that there weren't enough people.
[00:16:56.264 --> 00:17:00.605]  And so we're probably going to be seeing this again, that there aren't enough people on the no-fly list.
[00:17:00.745 --> 00:17:14.888]  And you see, this is one of those words that we're really hearing put out that even Donald Trump is meeting with the NRA to talk about this no-fly list and how that is going to be the new thing that keeps people from being able to access guns.
[00:17:15.408 --> 00:17:18.669]  So I'm sure we'll be keeping our eyes on what's going on there.
[00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:37.263]  But one of the things that's becoming a challenge for the Internet, which as we're seeing, you know, this is right at the time the FCC is clamping down on control of the Internet, the social media giants are having to fight back against the fact that people are live streaming these attacks.
[00:17:37.903 --> 00:18:00.618]  The Orlando shooter was updating Facebook in real time with what he was doing and of course the deadly attack on a policeman and his wife in France Was right there on Facebook live a 13-minute video of this attack taking place And so now we're gonna start seeing a crackdown on social media because they're getting sued one of the Paris attack victims father
[00:18:01.178 --> 00:18:06.241]  Is actually going to be suing Google, Facebook and Twitter saying, you know, they let their terrorism spread.
[00:18:06.281 --> 00:18:07.662]  They let the propaganda spread.
[00:18:08.482 --> 00:18:15.406]  And this week, the FCC upheld the commission's net neutrality rules on Tuesday.
[00:18:15.446 --> 00:18:26.312]  So this allows the agency to regulate the Internet like it's a public utility so they can have more control and they don't want any free exchange of information in a technocracy.
[00:18:26.832 --> 00:18:38.200]  So we will definitely be talking more on that, as well as the hackers who've released the secret Clinton docs from the State Department, which is DNC's Trump opposition file.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.183]  We'll have more on that coming right up, and then joining us from Dallas, Kit Daniels.
[00:19:04.898 --> 00:19:09.299]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.439 --> 00:19:12.079]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.760]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:27.183]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type 1 civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.854 --> 00:19:39.220]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:50.126]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.
[00:22:47.091 --> 00:22:53.820]  Check out Brain Force today and other game-changing compounds like X2, Survival Shield, at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.523]  Again, that's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:23:03.834 --> 00:23:15.262]  Well, thousands of alleged DNC documents have been released online, and this was a hacker who has released these secret Clinton docs, and it's all the Trump opposition file.
[00:23:15.842 --> 00:23:20.445]  So, this hacker kind of went online and said, oh, you don't believe me that I really accessed this?
[00:23:20.485 --> 00:23:21.646]  Well, boom, here it is.
[00:23:22.066 --> 00:23:32.113]  It's a hacker identifying as Goosepher 2.0, and that's an homage to the now-imprisoned Romanian hacker who was the one who actually first revealed that Hillary had a private email.
[00:23:34.174 --> 00:23:44.699]  Now he's saying that worldwide known cybersecurity company CrowdStrike announced that the Democratic National Committee servers had been hacked by sophisticated hacker groups.
[00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:48.580]  I'm very pleased the company appreciated my skills so highly.
[00:23:48.921 --> 00:23:50.461]  But in fact, it was easy.
[00:23:50.901 --> 00:23:51.682]  Very easy.
[00:23:52.362 --> 00:23:57.105]  And so he's just kind of bragging and saying, shame on CrowdStrike.
[00:23:57.125 --> 00:24:02.308]  Do you think I've been in the DNC's networks for almost a year and saved only two documents?
[00:24:02.648 --> 00:24:03.528]  Do you really believe it?
[00:24:03.828 --> 00:24:09.932]  Here are just a few docs from many thousands I extracted when hacking into the DNC's network.
[00:24:10.872 --> 00:24:19.243]  And so this first document that we have featured here is the DNC's 200 plus page opposition research file on Donald Trump.
[00:24:19.644 --> 00:24:24.050]  It details the party's narrative regarding the presumptive Republican nominee.
[00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:28.075]  So this hacker just did Trump's camp a huge favor.
[00:24:28.916 --> 00:24:47.402]  It's huge because as he can see, their whole game plan, and it almost reads like a timeline, because you can see the things that they struck with first, you know, he treats women bad, he's a liar, he only cares about himself, he offends minorities, he's racist, bankruptcy, his foreign policy.
[00:24:47.702 --> 00:24:49.623]  So these are all things that we have seen.
[00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:51.924]  We're good to go.
[00:25:14.747 --> 00:25:17.629]  Trump might have a little bit of the upper hand with these opposition files.
[00:25:17.649 --> 00:25:21.951]  We'll have to see if Guccifer 2.0 is going to release anything else.
[00:25:22.432 --> 00:25:30.576]  But something very interesting, last night or the other night I reported about this apparent hack and the DNC said don't worry about it.
[00:25:30.776 --> 00:25:39.782]  They haven't been able to access any of our donor information, no money, nobody has been exposed as far as their address and this.
[00:25:40.282 --> 00:25:40.943]  That's not true.
[00:25:55.802 --> 00:26:25.602]  Stifle you know random people all of these companies showing millions of dollars being donated to the Clinton camp I guess we don't have any of theirs super identifying information there as far as their address But we know what state they're from their names how much they donated so once again the DNC Lied to its donors not only didn't tell him that they had been hacked into and trying to work on it for over a year But continued to take in that personal information and then lied and said don't worry it wasn't
[00:26:26.322 --> 00:26:30.283]  You know, ever at any kind of a threat at any point.
[00:26:30.763 --> 00:26:37.384]  Now, Hillary Clinton also came out and said that this was atrocious and that, you know, how could a government server be hacked like this?
[00:26:37.444 --> 00:26:38.224]  It's not safe.
[00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:50.407]  Total irony lost in the fact that she herself set up a home brew server, which clearly wasn't safe at all because the original Goosefur was the one who was able to access her files.
[00:26:50.907 --> 00:26:52.407]  But, you know, that's neither here nor there.
[00:26:52.907 --> 00:26:55.708]  Now we're going to be going to tonight's Trump rally.
[00:26:56.288 --> 00:27:01.770]  There on the ground we've got our reporters to see, you know, if Donald Trump's got a new card up his sleeve.
[00:27:02.611 --> 00:27:06.972]  Joining me now from the ground in Dallas at tonight's Trump rally is our reporter Kit Daniels.
[00:27:07.032 --> 00:27:07.993]  Kit, what's going on?
[00:27:08.033 --> 00:27:08.793]  Describe the scene.
[00:27:09.893 --> 00:27:14.315]  Yes, I'm here in downtown Dallas and what we've seen so far is a huge police presence.
[00:27:14.395 --> 00:27:16.296]  I don't know if you can see it on camera right now, but
[00:27:17.065 --> 00:27:21.808]  The local media was reporting yesterday that they were expecting about 3,000 to 4,000 protesters.
[00:27:22.048 --> 00:27:26.130]  And the Dallas police did a riot training in Fair Park yesterday.
[00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.651]  They took the threat very seriously.
[00:27:28.191 --> 00:27:31.353]  Now that said, since I've been here, I've only seen about 50 protesters.
[00:27:32.013 --> 00:27:39.217]  And I've seen, there's been waves of Trump's people coming to see Trump the past hour, an hour and a half.
[00:27:39.257 --> 00:27:43.759]  I've seen probably maybe five, six times as many Trump supporters than protesters.
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.020]  This is strange.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.221]  I've actually seen a lot more
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.341]  Infowars, people with Infowars shirts than Trump protesters.
[00:27:51.061 --> 00:27:52.401]  Now there's been a couple of factors.
[00:27:52.521 --> 00:27:55.662]  One thing is the police taking this place very seriously.
[00:27:55.702 --> 00:27:59.683]  They have put down perimeters, barricades, what have you.
[00:28:00.343 --> 00:28:06.744]  And actually I think in a way they've overreacted because it's hindered my ability as a journalist to report on this event.
[00:28:07.244 --> 00:28:14.046]  For example, there's a parking lot outside the event where they're having the media stand and
[00:28:15.214 --> 00:28:20.618]  There's a building right there and across the corner of the building are the protesters.
[00:28:21.238 --> 00:28:23.600]  And the police kind of got them in a free speech zone.
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.543]  And I tried to walk over there, but the police stopped me and says, hey, you can't come on the sidewalk.
[00:28:27.563 --> 00:28:28.744]  You got to stay in the parking lot.
[00:28:29.024 --> 00:28:32.487]  It's like, well, how am I supposed to go over there and report on the protesters?
[00:28:32.507 --> 00:28:34.348]  Like, well, you can come over here, but you can't go back.
[00:28:34.728 --> 00:28:36.670]  Meaning I can't go back outside the Trump event.
[00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:38.331]  I wasn't even going to go into the Trump event.
[00:28:39.071 --> 00:28:41.353]  So, you know, I understand how the police are
[00:28:42.039 --> 00:28:49.750]  Protecting the people coming to see Trump speak from violent protesters, like we saw with Sha'Carri Jackson, who got hit with a rock, I think, in Albuquerque.
[00:28:50.331 --> 00:28:58.343]  But, you know, we should be able to protect Trump supporters without infringing on the First Amendment and freedom of the press.
[00:28:59.835 --> 00:29:00.415]  Exactly.
[00:29:00.856 --> 00:29:06.019]  And so what, from what you can see with the protesters, is it the typical grievances?
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.761]  Are we, you know, he's racist and this and that?
[00:29:08.821 --> 00:29:11.103]  Or what were you able to find out?
[00:29:11.123 --> 00:29:16.566]  Yeah, that's the one thing in the past six months since this war started, reporting on these Trump protesters, they're all the same.
[00:29:16.606 --> 00:29:19.028]  They all use God wants law, for example.
[00:29:19.068 --> 00:29:20.389]  They call Trump a Nazi.
[00:29:20.729 --> 00:29:21.529]  Trump's racist.
[00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:23.150]  They use straw man arguments.
[00:29:23.191 --> 00:29:25.312]  Like when I was in Wisconsin, for example,
[00:29:25.799 --> 00:29:29.302]  This lady told me that Trump wanted to deport African-Americans back to Africa.
[00:29:29.322 --> 00:29:30.863]  I was like, well, when did he say that, man?
[00:29:30.883 --> 00:29:32.684]  He was like, well, one of his supporters did.
[00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:33.465]  And I was like, who?
[00:29:33.565 --> 00:29:34.085]  David Duke?
[00:29:34.566 --> 00:29:35.186]  No, it's not.
[00:29:35.386 --> 00:29:36.768]  That's not Trump saying that, you know?
[00:29:37.188 --> 00:29:41.371]  So it's like Trump gets blamed for stuff that he's never said and he doesn't believe.
[00:29:42.052 --> 00:29:49.257]  So, you know, it's the whole thing, you know, you've got these protesters that come out here with the same signs, regardless of what part of the country you're in.
[00:29:49.778 --> 00:29:54.081]  You know, you see a lot of anarcho-communists and a lot of these people, they,
[00:29:54.878 --> 00:30:00.820]  The thing I noticed about the Trump protesters is they want to rabble on and on about Trump, but they don't have any solutions on their own end.
[00:30:01.986 --> 00:30:02.506]  Exactly.
[00:30:02.606 --> 00:30:19.258]  And as we can see, those talking points come directly from the Trump opposition file, which of course, now thousands of these alleged DNC documents have been leaked online where it shows their talking points and then their backup talking points when those talking points seem to fail.
[00:30:19.338 --> 00:30:21.319]  And it is Trump's a racist.
[00:30:21.359 --> 00:30:22.500]  He treats women bad.
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:23.600]  He went through bankruptcy.
[00:30:24.001 --> 00:30:25.242]  What do you do?
[00:30:25.262 --> 00:30:27.203]  You think anything's going to happen at tonight's Trump rally?
[00:30:27.223 --> 00:30:31.826]  Will he talk about the fact that this hacker kind of did him a huge favor?
[00:30:33.046 --> 00:30:41.548]  That's a very key point you just made, Leigh-Anne, because what I've seen from these Trump rally, these Trump protesters at the Trump rallies, it seems like a very top-down movement.
[00:30:42.008 --> 00:30:43.468]  You know, they're getting their orders from above.
[00:30:43.488 --> 00:30:45.949]  This is not a grassroots Trump protest.
[00:30:46.529 --> 00:30:53.110]  I mean, I'm sure there's some, like, grassroots people that are coming here to protest Trump, but they're very few and far between.
[00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:58.811]  So that's why you're seeing the same, this homogeneality, if you will, with the Trump protesters.
[00:30:59.172 --> 00:31:00.916]  They're getting their orders from George Soros.
[00:31:00.996 --> 00:31:03.282]  They're getting their orders from George Soros Groups.
[00:31:03.583 --> 00:31:08.415]  Even if they're not directly on George Soros' payroll, they're still getting orders indirectly.
[00:31:09.682 --> 00:31:13.124]  Absolutely, and of course all the propaganda that they get in schools.
[00:31:13.184 --> 00:31:20.828]  Like we spoke to someone during the Ask Me Anything who said that his dean actually scolded him for wearing a Make America Great Again shirt.
[00:31:20.868 --> 00:31:24.710]  So at all directions these kids are getting propagated to.
[00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:25.811]  Well Kit, thank you so much.
[00:31:25.931 --> 00:31:27.772]  Where can people go to watch the videos?
[00:31:27.792 --> 00:31:29.753]  I know you guys are going to be there in Dallas.
[00:31:29.773 --> 00:31:32.735]  If anything does pop off, uploading stuff from Trump's event.
[00:31:33.783 --> 00:31:39.429]  Now we're going to be uploading to the Real Alex Jones channel on YouTube and also my YouTube channel, Resistance News.
[00:31:39.489 --> 00:31:44.675]  So check both of those out and also visit InfoWars.com throughout the night and especially in the morning.
[00:31:45.055 --> 00:31:46.777]  We'll have some videos uploaded there as well.
[00:31:47.458 --> 00:31:48.279]  Thank you, Kit Daniels.
[00:31:48.999 --> 00:31:49.260]  Thank you.
[00:31:50.154 --> 00:31:55.077]  Now after tonight's Trump rally, the guys are going to be heading to Houston and then on to Phoenix.
[00:31:55.097 --> 00:31:59.439]  They're going to be filing a lot of reports, hopefully getting to speak with some of those protesters there.
[00:31:59.739 --> 00:32:10.645]  And if they don't have them set up in a free speech zone in these other areas, we'll be able to see sort of the debate between the pro-Trump and the anti-Trump people that are showing up to these events.
[00:32:11.026 --> 00:32:13.167]  And hopefully we're going to be getting some more
[00:32:13.707 --> 00:32:17.628]  Epic debates, just like the one that you're going to be seeing in a segment coming up.
[00:32:17.688 --> 00:32:25.770]  It was a 16-year-old boy who held his own in the face of people who were just yelling, racist this and racist that.
[00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:29.991]  And man, just calmly slamming them down with facts.
[00:32:30.111 --> 00:32:31.411]  It is an epic takedown.
[00:32:31.731 --> 00:32:32.752]  You're not going to want to miss it.
[00:32:32.792 --> 00:32:33.732]  And that's coming right up.
[00:32:39.574 --> 00:32:47.380]  We celebrate the 4th of July as a reminder of earning our independence from a tyrannical and oppressive government.
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:54.185]  Just a reminder to the Obama administration, there's plenty of room on the calendar for another holiday.
[00:33:02.352 --> 00:33:04.754]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.
[00:33:57.342 --> 00:34:05.626]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when products are sold out, you're unable to get them, sometimes for months, but we hold back the products for people that have already signed up for AutoShip.

[00:34:21.033 --> 00:34:28.437]  Listers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products when you need them each month.
[00:34:29.474 --> 00:34:30.494]  Now it's finally here.
[00:34:30.954 --> 00:34:34.455]  AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:34:34.775 --> 00:34:35.255]  It's easy.

[00:34:42.937 --> 00:34:49.699]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, it's a sure win.
[00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:53.400]  You add to that free shipping on orders of $50, it is a can't lose.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:04.756 --> 00:37:05.476]  Small U.S.
[00:37:05.536 --> 00:37:19.040]  cities with access to affordable housing and manufacturing jobs are quietly receiving the bulk of Obama's invading Islamic Jihad Army, stretching unsuspecting local city budgets to the breaking point.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.040]  Bold statement?
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:33.404]  Yesterday on the Alex Jones Show, retired DHS officer and whistleblower Philip Haney explained why radical Islamic terrorists are falling through the cracks despite unprecedented government data gathering.
[00:37:33.584 --> 00:37:42.950]  When you encounter people coming back from flights from overseas or when they're preparing to depart to go outbound, we call it, to go overseas.
[00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:52.235]  We have the authority within the border, a greater amount of authority than the CIA and the FBI combined, to gather this kind of basic intelligence information.
[00:37:52.754 --> 00:38:03.900]  And over the years, we have been handcuffed more and more to the point where we're barely capable of gathering the kind of information that we could then share, let's say with the FBI.
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:08.222]  Some targeted American cities are already being pushed over the edge.
[00:38:08.442 --> 00:38:10.383]  For example, Amarillo, Texas.
[00:38:10.743 --> 00:38:11.324]  We're good to go!
[00:38:29.122 --> 00:38:34.267]  Has taken in well over a thousand Middle Eastern refugees already, the highest in the nation.
[00:38:34.607 --> 00:38:40.913]  But when you add refugees sent to Amarillo from countries outside the Middle East, the numbers skyrocket.
[00:38:41.073 --> 00:38:46.898]  World Net Daily reports Amarillo has received 5,251 foreign refugees since January of 2002, according to the Federal Refugee Database.
[00:38:51.622 --> 00:38:56.764]  That's more than half of the nearly 8,000 refugees sent to Texas during the same period.
[00:38:57.024 --> 00:39:02.425]  President Obama has increased that number of foreign refugees bound for American soil in fiscal 2016 to 85,000.
[00:39:02.505 --> 00:39:07.067]  That's a 20% increase over the previous year and 10,000 will be coming from the jihadist hotbed of Syria.
[00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:24.894]  Many of the community organizers have received training or consultation from David Lubell's Welcoming America organization, which was started with seed money from billionaire George Soros.
[00:39:25.374 --> 00:39:37.359]  Breitbart reported in January of 2016, Amarillo Mayor Paul Harpole said, We've been a giving community, and it's a huge disservice to bring in refugees in numbers that we're not able to handle.
[00:39:37.639 --> 00:39:39.720]  We create small ghettos.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.561]  The Amarillo, Texas mayor continues.
[00:39:42.901 --> 00:39:46.782]  A group of Somalis came in to say that they had elected a mayor of their community.
[00:39:47.002 --> 00:39:49.682]  Then another faction claimed they had their own leader.
[00:39:50.082 --> 00:39:55.504]  We come to find out that rival tribes, slaves and masters were being settled together.
[00:39:55.844 --> 00:40:00.465]  Amarillo 9-11 calls are now being fielded in 42 different languages.
[00:40:00.805 --> 00:40:07.447]  Heartball told Watchdog.org that Washington pays schools only $100 per refugee student per year.
[00:40:07.788 --> 00:40:13.329]  He continues, we have 660 refugee kids who don't speak English and the U.S.
[00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:17.351]  Department of Education says they have to be at grade level within one year.
[00:40:17.711 --> 00:40:19.492]  It's a ludicrous requirement.
[00:40:19.592 --> 00:40:21.734]  They don't even know how to use the bathroom.
[00:40:21.914 --> 00:40:41.386]  And while Governor Abbott and the Texas Health and Human Services Commission continue to push lawsuits against resettlement organizations and the federal government for not presenting regular consent as required by federal law, crime levels in Amarillo are reaching levels on par with much larger cities.
[00:40:41.767 --> 00:40:46.390]  Amarillo also has the highest rate of reported rape in Texas.
[00:40:48.311 --> 00:40:51.513]  The rape epidemic in this world is becoming pandemic.
[00:40:51.654 --> 00:40:54.576]  It's not confined to one location.
[00:40:55.256 --> 00:41:03.442]  Even the Muslim convert CIA director John Brennan has declared that terrorists are using the refugee system to infest the United States.
[00:41:03.963 --> 00:41:07.005]  Meanwhile, Amarillo immigrant Mohamed Moghadam
[00:41:07.205 --> 00:41:17.430]  Who came to Amarillo eight years ago, recently held his manager and another person hostage at gunpoint because he was passed over for a promotion for his job at Walmart.
[00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:21.812]  A SWAT team responded and proceeded to fatally shoot Moghadam.
[00:41:22.212 --> 00:41:26.734]  Was it workplace violence or a seed from a growing problem in Amarillo?
[00:41:27.174 --> 00:41:35.818]  Again, Amarillo refugees are creating separate ghettos with their own leaders, with their own ways of collectively non-assimilating.
[00:41:36.258 --> 00:41:47.500]  Refugees immediately qualify for full welfare benefits, green card status within a year, and receive full citizenship, including voting rights, within five years.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.941]  It's as clear as the nose on your face.
[00:41:50.341 --> 00:42:05.724]  An invasion of our taxpayer dollars, our schools, our city budgets, and our voting booths is fully underway, driven by big business for cheaper labor and the misleading Obama administration wielding a divide-and-conquer agenda that is becoming clearer every day.
[00:42:06.104 --> 00:42:09.790]  Funded by, yep, you guessed it, the American people.
[00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:15.838]  The future of the meaning of even being a citizen of the United States is on the chopping block.
[00:42:16.099 --> 00:42:18.102]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[00:42:22.986 --> 00:42:25.648]  Young black men supporting a racist!
[00:42:25.668 --> 00:42:26.108]  Thank you.
[00:42:26.148 --> 00:42:27.249]  Yeah, that is awesome.
[00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.731]  That's sad!
[00:42:29.651 --> 00:42:33.695]  How does your parents feel about you holding a Trump stand?
[00:42:33.875 --> 00:42:38.178]  Well, they should scrape to America too because he doesn't like you or your parents.
[00:42:38.999 --> 00:42:40.660]  You didn't answer my question, by the way.
[00:42:40.781 --> 00:42:42.242]  Yeah, you didn't answer our question.
[00:42:42.282 --> 00:42:43.082]  What has he said?
[00:42:43.122 --> 00:42:45.444]  He said send Mexicans back to Mexico.
[00:42:45.605 --> 00:42:47.446]  No, he said- He said don't let Muslims here.
[00:42:47.466 --> 00:42:47.946]  Yeah, he said- What?
[00:42:48.147 --> 00:42:51.109]  Are you going to let me talk or are you going to yell?
[00:42:51.389 --> 00:42:56.153]  No, I'm telling you because you holding this crop top and you need to be taught- We can't have an educated conversation, can we?
[00:42:56.173 --> 00:42:56.994]  We cannot do that, right?
[00:42:57.354 --> 00:43:02.919]  And then kids are telling you against your own people- He just graduated high school, so she's not a kid no more.
[00:43:03.419 --> 00:43:04.340]  Okay, that's it.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:09.601]  What would you tell him when a racist sends Mexicans back to Mexico?
[00:43:09.621 --> 00:43:11.282]  What would you tell a young black man?
[00:43:11.382 --> 00:43:13.763]  I only believe that he's going to send illegals back.
[00:43:14.143 --> 00:43:17.844]  He said in your place, send Mexicans back to Mexico.
[00:43:17.864 --> 00:43:18.724]  Just illegals.
[00:43:18.824 --> 00:43:20.104]  Illegals only.
[00:43:20.905 --> 00:43:22.365]  His wife is not legal.
[00:43:22.425 --> 00:43:23.245]  She's from Europe.
[00:43:23.525 --> 00:43:24.426]  She's legal.
[00:43:24.706 --> 00:43:26.426]  She was born in Europe.
[00:43:26.466 --> 00:43:29.007]  Why would her husband be running for president?
[00:43:29.527 --> 00:43:30.088]  So she has a U.S.
[00:43:30.128 --> 00:43:34.630]  citizenship, so just because she was born in another country does not mean she has a legal citizenship.
[00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:35.731]  That's fine, you don't have to.
[00:43:35.751 --> 00:43:37.352]  You're a real man.
[00:43:37.392 --> 00:43:41.894]  If he's elected, he would be against you because of your skin color, young man.
[00:43:42.134 --> 00:43:43.735]  And you're probably like 30-something, but you're a U.S.
[00:43:43.775 --> 00:43:45.476]  You're only like 16-year-old.
[00:43:45.516 --> 00:43:46.797]  He's against black people.
[00:43:46.817 --> 00:43:48.358]  That's fine, that's fine, thank you.
[00:43:48.378 --> 00:43:50.239]  And go listen to him speak, and he'll prove you wrong.
[00:43:50.259 --> 00:43:51.900]  There are many black people who support Trump.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:52.660]  Plenty of them.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:53.641]  It came with the black guy.
[00:43:53.741 --> 00:43:54.621]  I think his VP might be black.
[00:43:55.922 --> 00:43:57.243]  Oh, I thought you saw that rally.
[00:43:57.263 --> 00:43:58.884]  You see a lot of black people.
[00:43:58.924 --> 00:44:00.425]  The media won't show you that though.
[00:44:00.445 --> 00:44:02.966]  Black people in there are going to stand up against Trump.
[00:44:03.847 --> 00:44:04.987]  You sure about that?
[00:44:05.007 --> 00:44:06.068]  You sure about that?
[00:44:06.088 --> 00:44:10.270]  One of the black people that he asked his security guards to kick out of the rally.
[00:44:10.411 --> 00:44:11.851]  Oh, in Valdosta State?
[00:44:12.011 --> 00:44:13.712]  Oh, they were protesting against him.
[00:44:15.314 --> 00:44:17.155]  You cannot protest in a rally.
[00:44:17.175 --> 00:44:18.136]  Why would you do that?
[00:44:18.857 --> 00:44:19.978]  We don't go to your rally.
[00:44:20.138 --> 00:44:21.199]  We don't go to your rally.
[00:44:21.479 --> 00:44:23.981]  He does the same thing to white people, too, so I understand.
[00:44:24.262 --> 00:44:28.626]  He does the exact same thing to white people, too, so... I mean, if you're going to protest against us...
[00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:35.591]  I don't like self-supporters, like freedom of speech.
[00:44:35.711 --> 00:44:38.913]  You should go get educated on what supporters really stand for.
[00:44:38.933 --> 00:44:39.934]  I'm very educated.
[00:44:39.974 --> 00:44:42.536]  We're being educated and that's why we came here.
[00:44:42.576 --> 00:44:44.617]  It's sad that you're leaving.
[00:44:44.737 --> 00:44:46.078]  It's sad that you're running out.
[00:44:46.098 --> 00:44:47.739]  What's your degree?
[00:44:47.759 --> 00:44:48.880]  That's not the question.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.481]  Are you educated in economics?
[00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:54.464]  Are you educated in any sort of political background?
[00:44:54.564 --> 00:44:56.905]  I've worked on many campaigns and it's so sad.
[00:44:56.925 --> 00:44:57.986]  It's very vague.
[00:44:58.667 --> 00:44:59.567]  It's very sad.
[00:44:59.587 --> 00:44:59.927]  What campaign?
[00:45:00.748 --> 00:45:01.589]  Donald Trump is a hater.
[00:45:01.629 --> 00:45:02.210]  He's a racist.
[00:45:16.065 --> 00:45:17.246]  He is a racist!
[00:45:17.266 --> 00:45:20.608]  He believes in hate!
[00:45:21.749 --> 00:45:25.031]  Do you know the history of his grandfather and father?
[00:45:25.311 --> 00:45:27.912]  They was KK members!
[00:45:27.932 --> 00:45:30.234]  They own real estate in New York!
[00:45:30.894 --> 00:45:32.274]  Go Google it.
[00:45:32.535 --> 00:45:35.556]  Go read the history of Donald Trump family.
[00:45:35.576 --> 00:45:36.936]  You have very horrible facts.
[00:45:36.956 --> 00:45:42.158]  People are now black and Jews and property in New York where he bought property.
[00:45:42.178 --> 00:45:46.439]  That's what his grandfather and his father was KKK members.
[00:45:46.459 --> 00:45:47.439]  Go read the history.
[00:45:47.519 --> 00:45:48.240]  KKK members?
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.460]  You mean not KKK members?
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.220]  They was KKK clansmen.
[00:45:52.901 --> 00:45:54.201]  Who's against your color?
[00:45:54.681 --> 00:45:56.242]  Against your skin?
[00:45:56.302 --> 00:45:57.942]  Against your people and your ancestors?
[00:45:58.102 --> 00:46:00.423]  I think the Democratic Party founded the KKK, by the way.
[00:46:00.443 --> 00:46:01.323]  Just saying.
[00:46:01.363 --> 00:46:02.243]  Let me tell you.
[00:46:02.303 --> 00:46:03.323]  I'm for the people.
[00:46:03.463 --> 00:46:05.584]  It's not because I'm a Democrat or Republican.
[00:46:05.844 --> 00:46:06.684]  I'm for the people.
[00:46:07.884 --> 00:46:09.484]  The people are united.
[00:46:09.504 --> 00:46:10.665]  We'll never be defeated.
[00:46:11.185 --> 00:46:12.585]  And that's what I believe in.
[00:46:13.005 --> 00:46:16.086]  Donald Trump trying to divide the country.
[00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:17.246]  He's not trying to divide us.
[00:46:17.286 --> 00:46:19.066]  He's trying to unite us.
[00:46:19.246 --> 00:46:22.547]  Just because his policies are not like yours doesn't mean he's not trying to unite us.
[00:46:22.847 --> 00:46:25.388]  There's a way to legally immigrate.
[00:46:44.255 --> 00:46:46.097]  Do you not, did you not know that?
[00:46:46.137 --> 00:46:47.098]  You don't know that.
[00:46:47.158 --> 00:46:48.580]  Oh my God, just stop it.
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:51.002]  Yeah, because you don't know anything.
[00:46:51.022 --> 00:46:56.948]  You need to go learn how to spell your first name, go to college, get a high school education, and then you come back and talk to me.
[00:46:57.749 --> 00:46:58.090]  Thank you.

[00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:09.794]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.914 --> 00:47:16.701]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:47:16.941 --> 00:47:20.225]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.245 --> 00:47:21.406]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.707 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:52.195]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:47:52.396 --> 00:47:53.016]  Or call 888-253-3139.

[00:47:55.759 --> 00:47:56.920]  And we thank you for your support.
[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.701]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:48:41.081 --> 00:48:46.583]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the InfoWar.
[00:48:47.023 --> 00:48:53.687]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
[00:48:54.028 --> 00:48:58.891]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:49:05.143 --> 00:49:10.167]  And joining me in studio now is David Knight, and we're going to talk a little bit about the situation going on in Venezuela.
[00:49:10.547 --> 00:49:18.212]  The long bread lines have now turned into violent protests as people are becoming increasingly more hungry, more desperate.
[00:49:18.733 --> 00:49:26.958]  And I really feel as if we're not being shown exactly what's going on down there, because this is a huge warning to what we could expect here in America.
[00:49:26.998 --> 00:49:32.943]  Not only warnings about citizen disarmament, but also the trick of falling for this
[00:49:34.213 --> 00:49:35.634]  Utopia of socialism.
[00:49:35.994 --> 00:49:36.675]  That's right, Leanne.
[00:49:36.835 --> 00:49:44.799]  They've been sold the socialist utopia and there's a newer, more subtle spin on this socialist utopia that we're going to talk about in just a moment.
[00:49:45.119 --> 00:49:50.962]  But I think it's truly amazing to see that as this is unfolding and we're getting all these tales of massive privation.
[00:49:51.003 --> 00:49:56.646]  We see the Venezuela's top court has said the media cannot publish videos of lynchings.
[00:49:56.986 --> 00:49:58.927]  This is how bad the violence in the street is getting.
[00:49:59.227 --> 00:50:07.792]  But we've got what I think really amounts to a French Revolution moment here, where you've got Marie Antoinette saying, let them eat cake and they live their life of luxury in the Palace of Versailles.
[00:50:08.093 --> 00:50:10.194]  This is what's going on in Venezuela right now.
[00:50:10.514 --> 00:50:10.714]  Right.
[00:50:10.834 --> 00:50:12.495]  I mean, it's absolutely disgusting.
[00:50:12.956 --> 00:50:18.339]  And this is, I'm always saying, if you want to know what this socialist utopia is going to look like, just watch the Hunger Games.
[00:50:18.679 --> 00:50:23.462]  It's a perfect idea of what, you know, the majority of us are going to be dealing with.
[00:50:23.482 --> 00:50:25.003]  We've got Hunger Games in Venezuela right now.
[00:50:25.063 --> 00:50:26.204]  Fire games going on in Venezuela.
[00:50:26.224 --> 00:50:30.747]  So we're seeing middle class people just like you and I who are getting desperate.
[00:50:30.767 --> 00:50:34.029]  They want to feed their kids, but now there are reported injuries.
[00:50:34.709 --> 00:50:35.850]  Hundreds of people have been arrested.
[00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:37.611]  At least five people are dead.
[00:50:38.171 --> 00:50:41.353]  Angry protests breaking in and grocery stores and businesses.
[00:50:42.294 --> 00:50:48.338]  The protesters have also attacked the headquarters of President Nicolás Maduro's Socialist Party there.
[00:50:48.958 --> 00:50:51.680]  And they are demanding to be fed.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:56.242]  Yeah, they're eating dogs and cats on the street and yet we've got these pictures of dogs and cats who are starving as well.
[00:50:56.642 --> 00:50:57.943]  Dogs and cats can't get any food either.
[00:50:57.963 --> 00:51:08.387]  Right, yeah, just starving dogs and cats and then there's gangs on motorcycles who are trying to fight over the right to control the distribution of food because of course the population there has been disarmed.
[00:51:09.548 --> 00:51:15.070]  Maduro said that, you know, that had to happen a few years ago to bring peace to the country because they knew it was coming.
[00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:24.395]  But then here on the other side, we've got these super-rich socialists here who are just living in the lap of luxury, sipping on champagne and country clubs.
[00:51:24.516 --> 00:51:26.737]  Like $100,000 a year to stay in this country club.
[00:51:26.757 --> 00:51:27.758]  $100,000 a year.
[00:51:27.798 --> 00:51:29.058]  Forging on this food.
[00:51:29.078 --> 00:51:30.919]  Yeah, they have no shortage of food there.
[00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:32.400]  Look, they saw this coming.
[00:51:32.781 --> 00:51:34.321]  Four years ago, they began gun control.
[00:51:34.942 --> 00:51:42.306]  Last December and November, we were talking about how they were hunting policemen down in the streets to get their firearms, okay?
[00:51:42.586 --> 00:51:44.628]  And this is what people need to understand in this country.
[00:51:45.228 --> 00:51:49.791]  First of all, all this talk about gun control, they're doing this because they're concerned they're going to lose control.
[00:51:49.811 --> 00:51:54.434]  We're going to talk about their method of control that is a soft kill that's coming up for us.
[00:51:54.754 --> 00:51:57.116]  That's what they talked about at Bilderberg, and we've mentioned that before.
[00:51:57.156 --> 00:52:02.159]  But when you look at those pictures of what's going on in Venezuela, just remember they began four years ago with gun control.
[00:52:02.199 --> 00:52:07.263]  They spent $47 million to set up 60 centers where they were going to have gun confiscation.
[00:52:07.603 --> 00:52:10.225]  And then after that, as we reported last November 4th,
[00:52:10.945 --> 00:52:12.086]  You've got the policemen.
[00:52:12.106 --> 00:52:18.311]  252 security officers had been killed for their guns from January to October.
[00:52:18.351 --> 00:52:20.993]  That's about 25 a month being hunted down and killed.
[00:52:21.073 --> 00:52:24.856]  One guy, the first one they talk about in the Guardian story, 18 years in the police force.
[00:52:24.876 --> 00:52:25.817]  He's on his way home.
[00:52:26.137 --> 00:52:26.678]  He's shot.
[00:52:26.698 --> 00:52:27.718]  They come after him.
[00:52:28.279 --> 00:52:28.899]  They search him.
[00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:29.940]  They don't find a gun.
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:30.901]  They kill him anyway.
[00:52:31.101 --> 00:52:31.381]  Okay?
[00:52:31.401 --> 00:52:32.042]  He's got a family.
[00:52:32.202 --> 00:52:33.223]  This is where this is headed.
[00:52:33.783 --> 00:52:38.345]  This is where people everywhere, including the law enforcement officers, need to understand where this is going.
[00:52:38.365 --> 00:52:43.568]  But there's another interesting article we had today, Leanne, and that was a college professor who's rejected socialism.
[00:52:43.608 --> 00:52:49.291]  He's traveled around the world and he goes, yeah, I understand the theories, I understand the utopian promises, but I saw the reality.
[00:52:49.371 --> 00:52:55.354]  He says, I went to the USSR, Eastern Europe, China, Cuba, etc., and he said, I saw that socialism doesn't work.
[00:52:55.834 --> 00:53:02.800]  It's a revolutionary imposition and it inevitably leads to cruelty, injustice and the loss of freedom.
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:09.046]  He said, I could see the same pattern in the many failed left-wing revolutionaries in Latin America and elsewhere.
[00:53:09.106 --> 00:53:15.411]  I succeeded in disabusing myself of the utopian notions that fatally attract people to these leftist ideas.
[00:53:16.252 --> 00:53:22.036]  He's learned what's going on, but of course Bernie Sanders, or as I call him, Bernie Sandinista, he never understood.
[00:53:22.296 --> 00:53:30.201]  And he is indoctrinating a new generation of lugheads to follow these pied pipers down the path of destruction.
[00:53:30.421 --> 00:53:31.442]  And of course Hillary Clinton...
[00:53:32.102 --> 00:53:34.984]  It has an advisor who hasn't learned this yet.
[00:53:35.024 --> 00:53:42.488]  Of course, this is a Nobel Prize winning Joseph Stiglitz, an economist who won the Nobel Prize during a 2007 visit to Venezuela.
[00:53:42.528 --> 00:53:50.012]  He said this, Venezuelan President Chavez appears to have had success in bringing health and education to the people in the poor neighborhoods of Caracas.
[00:53:50.332 --> 00:53:57.075]  It's not only important to have sustainable growth, but to ensure the best distribution of economic growth for the benefit of all citizens.
[00:53:57.316 --> 00:53:59.637]  And he still holds to that, and he is somebody
[00:54:00.017 --> 00:54:04.160]  Who has been put on the, he's an influential advisor to Hillary Clinton.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:10.405]  And of course he can get away with making that statement because they're controlling all the media that's coming out of Venezuela, so you can see the reality of it.
[00:54:10.565 --> 00:54:15.588]  And as reported multiple times, it wasn't just gun control, but it was also product control.
[00:54:15.729 --> 00:54:17.270]  Water, food, medicine.
[00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:22.393]  This article from two years ago, Bloomberg Press, okay, it was back in June of 2014.
[00:54:22.794 --> 00:54:27.978]  They said, by putting off the local companies responsible for supplying everything from diapers to cancer meds,
[00:54:28.818 --> 00:54:33.381]  Maduro can preserve access to debt markets, and he can protect oil shipments.
[00:54:33.401 --> 00:54:34.842]  It would be vulnerable, okay?
[00:54:34.882 --> 00:54:40.667]  They say the government's priority, this is an analyst at Barclays, and he tells this to the New York Press.
[00:54:40.707 --> 00:54:44.009]  He says the government's priority is to pay the sovereign debt.
[00:54:44.049 --> 00:54:49.513]  In other words, the government's priority is not feeding its citizens this Marxist government, this utopian Marxist government.
[00:54:49.833 --> 00:54:53.556]  Their priority is not to feed the citizens, but to feed the bankers, okay?
[00:54:53.596 --> 00:54:53.716]  Wow.
[00:54:54.136 --> 00:55:05.362]  And so what we see with Bilderberg, they talked about the precariat, and I think they deliberately put this term out there, because this is nothing but Marxism repackaged.
[00:55:05.883 --> 00:55:11.686]  But what's really dangerous about it is that they're now getting libertarian think tanks to sign onto this as well, Leigh Ann.
[00:55:11.706 --> 00:55:12.326]  Right.
[00:55:12.447 --> 00:55:16.369]  And so when they talk about the precariat, remember they're talking about class warfare,
[00:55:16.869 --> 00:55:29.039]  The proletariat, who are now in a precarious position because of globalist policies, because of open borders, because they have shipped jobs abroad and imported workers, and people in the West are suffering from this.
[00:55:29.079 --> 00:55:32.742]  So how do they control these people who are getting increasingly angry?
[00:55:33.282 --> 00:55:39.207]  And they understand that it's not just the globalist policies, but it's also the technological changes that are down the line.
[00:55:39.247 --> 00:55:41.829]  Because the guy who has popularized this,
[00:55:42.409 --> 00:55:48.275]  Put this out on the Singularity Hub, talking about how automation, not just immigration, is going to take people's jobs.
[00:55:48.335 --> 00:55:56.765]  But this is what's scary, Leanna, and this is the fact that we've got Forbes magazine, we've got Business Insider, we've got the Wall Street Journal, and what are they pushing?
[00:55:57.225 --> 00:56:00.989]  They're pushing a form of socialism and independence.
[00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:03.432]  The universal basic income.
[00:56:03.952 --> 00:56:09.718]  And they're selling this as the solution to these displaced and angry people who no longer have a job.
[00:56:09.978 --> 00:56:13.582]  And we just saw the referendum in Switzerland a week or so ago.
[00:56:14.043 --> 00:56:18.127]  But Forbes is saying the universal basic income idea is not crazy.
[00:56:18.467 --> 00:56:22.852]  Business Insider says the biggest obstacle to universal basic income has nothing to do with money.
[00:56:23.192 --> 00:56:26.275]  It has to do with us redefining this obsolete notion of work.
[00:56:27.136 --> 00:56:30.740]  Now we've talked over and over again how they say the future does not need us.
[00:56:31.461 --> 00:56:33.383]  Well, yeah, the elites don't need us either.
[00:56:33.743 --> 00:56:38.869]  The question for the elites that they're addressing at Bilderberg is how do they pacify and control us?
[00:56:39.209 --> 00:56:43.975]  I think one of the most distressing things that I saw, exactly, we have Charles Murray
[00:56:44.395 --> 00:56:46.996]  This is a guy who's a noted libertarian economist.
[00:56:47.437 --> 00:56:54.921]  In 1984, he wrote Losing Ground, which is all about how welfare destroys people and makes them dependent upon the government.
[00:56:55.261 --> 00:56:57.482]  He made a very strong analytical case.
[00:56:57.762 --> 00:57:00.323]  He looked at a lot of metrics over a very long period of time.
[00:57:00.363 --> 00:57:04.005]  It became the basis for welfare reform in the Reagan administration.
[00:57:04.466 --> 00:57:08.128]  And yet he is now working for the American Enterprise Institute.
[00:57:08.148 --> 00:57:08.748]  You would think that
[00:57:09.168 --> 00:57:13.211]  They would be all for promoting free enterprise and work and everything, right?
[00:57:13.371 --> 00:57:14.712]  It's funded by the Koch brothers.
[00:57:15.133 --> 00:57:24.119]  And what are the Koch brothers and Charles Murray, this libertarian economist, and the American Enterprise Union, they're all pushing universal basic income, a form of welfare.
[00:57:24.279 --> 00:57:24.540]  Why?
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:28.023]  Because it will make you dependent upon them.
[00:57:28.183 --> 00:57:29.284]  It will pacify you.
[00:57:29.544 --> 00:57:46.059]  And we have seen this in the Agenda 21 policies in the Northeast that the Bureau of Land Management and the Forester Services have done, when they said no longer will the loggers in Oregon be able to log.
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:51.402]  And we're going to just shut down that economy because the entire economy was based around that one thing.
[00:57:51.682 --> 00:57:52.302]  They shut it down.
[00:57:52.322 --> 00:57:56.203]  They said, don't worry, we'll give you 10 years to adapt to this.
[00:57:56.283 --> 00:57:58.604]  Well, there's nothing else that anybody can do in that area.
[00:57:58.924 --> 00:58:02.526]  They put them on welfare for 10 years and then they shut it off.
[00:58:02.586 --> 00:58:05.807]  They can't even pay their police departments in those areas.
[00:58:06.027 --> 00:58:16.652]  Wow, I mean that's just incredible and a huge warning for everyone that we all need to start preparing ourselves and taking care of our families, growing what we can, sharing with our neighbors.
[00:58:17.032 --> 00:58:23.074]  We need to use this as an opportunity, a warning, to start preparing ourselves and not giving up more to the government.
[00:58:23.314 --> 00:58:32.038]  And understand that it's the left and the right is a phony paradigm breakdown and the elitists on both sides are joining together to find means to make us dependent upon them.
[00:58:32.438 --> 00:58:33.519]  Wow, thank you David.
