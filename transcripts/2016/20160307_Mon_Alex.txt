[00:00:03.268 --> 00:00:05.951]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:17.164]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA Region 6 in Occupy.
[00:00:23.547 --> 00:00:24.808]  There is a war.
[00:00:25.248 --> 00:00:26.228]  It's happening now.
[00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.910]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.251]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:33.512]  We are the resistance.
[00:00:33.972 --> 00:00:35.813]  We are the Infowar.
[00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:43.737]  Alex Jones here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:43.857 --> 00:00:47.739]  We are broadcasting worldwide on this live.
[00:00:48.752 --> 00:00:52.254]  Monday, March 7, 2016, Global Transmission.
[00:00:52.714 --> 00:01:09.984]  Paul Joseph Watson is coming up at the bottom of the hour to break down the huge geopolitical developments unfolding around our world and what the weaponized, controlled corporate media is doing, not just here in the US or Canada, but in Australia.
[00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:13.887]  Across the European Union and across the United Kingdom as well.
[00:01:14.247 --> 00:01:23.974]  They are engaged in weaponized balkanization, weaponized promotion of open race and religion war.
[00:01:24.414 --> 00:01:25.415]  It is incredible.
[00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:27.677]  You understand, obviously.
[00:01:28.564 --> 00:01:32.345]  But you've got to get the word out to others that don't understand what's happening because it's so tragic.
[00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:41.067]  When Beyonce at the Super Bowl does her anti-white, anti-police event, that is not some black woman pushing racism.
[00:01:41.127 --> 00:01:52.269]  That is the NFL that is paid to do the fake patriotic displays, that is paid, paid to push the anti-gun, quote, brainwashing, as the Attorney General famously said.
[00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:53.869]  That is a mission.
[00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.069]  That is a program.
[00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.170]  And the same thing is done in Europe.
[00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.174]  It's denounced by police groups who are grassroots and aren't controlled.
[00:02:01.575 --> 00:02:04.538]  But from the top, it is Justice Department run.
[00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:07.742]  And Paul Watson's going to be breaking this down big time, coming up.
[00:02:08.323 --> 00:02:15.972]  Bernie Sanders, in the Democrat debate yesterday, came out and said, White people don't know, we're going to play the clip in a moment, don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.771]  Again, as if whites are this superclass, this royalty around the world.
[00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:30.437]  This is the elite of the globe that have stolen the wealth, setting up tyranny, trying to blame white people if there's any class envy or somebody doesn't have money.
[00:02:30.777 --> 00:02:35.140]  There are twice as many, and we're going to go over the numbers coming up, the feds admit,
[00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.850]  Why is
[00:02:52.342 --> 00:02:59.045]  I mean, that is just crazy to sit there and just act like, because you're white, you know, you've been given a leprechaun and a whole pot of gold.
[00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:02.787]  Think of the level of weaponized media that that is.
[00:03:03.067 --> 00:03:08.630]  And think how they've opened Europe's borders and our borders and say, we have to pay for everything or we're bad.
[00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.734]  This is indentured servitude for the Western world and for white people as a new second-class citizen.
[00:03:15.934 --> 00:03:17.274]  They're actually saying we're devils.
[00:03:17.835 --> 00:03:19.796]  Next it'll be, wear yellow stars.
[00:03:20.376 --> 00:03:25.438]  What if Bernie Sanders had said, Jews don't know what it's like to be poor, or Hispanics don't.
[00:03:25.498 --> 00:03:29.739]  It's so racist, but it's okay because it's against white people.
[00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.580]  This is total demonized white people come after white people.
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.822]  That will then cause whites to either submit to political correctness in the bullying and do whatever they're told, or
[00:03:40.492 --> 00:03:44.553]  They will turn into racist, ladies and gentlemen, and then join the other side.
[00:03:44.753 --> 00:03:45.413]  And that's what they do.
[00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:46.993]  They're setting up prison management.
[00:03:47.553 --> 00:03:50.734]  Prison management with people in different groups fighting with each other.
[00:03:50.934 --> 00:03:51.774]  We're going to go to break.
[00:03:52.034 --> 00:03:53.534]  I'm going to come back and break this down more.
[00:03:53.574 --> 00:03:57.735]  But first, here's that clip of Bernie Sanders in his own stinking words saying it.
[00:03:57.755 --> 00:04:02.656]  Some young people active in the Black Lives Matter movement.
[00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:08.517]  Young lady comes up to me and she says, you don't understand
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.801]  What police do in certain black communities.
[00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:17.822]  You don't understand the degree to which we are terrorized.
[00:04:18.122 --> 00:04:26.883]  And I'm not just shooting, I'm not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and we've got to hold police officers accountable.
[00:04:27.404 --> 00:04:33.985]  I'm just talking about everyday activities where police officers are bullying people.
[00:04:34.904 --> 00:04:45.507]  So, to answer your question, I would say, and I think it's similar to what the Secretary said, when you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[00:04:46.067 --> 00:04:48.367]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:04:48.748 --> 00:04:54.229]  You don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car.
[00:04:55.209 --> 00:04:59.770]  And I believe that as a nation in the year 2016, we must be firm in making it clear
[00:05:03.084 --> 00:05:10.666]  We will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal justice system.
[00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:14.668]  Donald Trump is shaking up the world order, and that's something we've needed for a very long time.
[00:05:14.928 --> 00:05:17.488]  For one thing, foreign diplomats are expressing alarm to U.S.
[00:05:17.528 --> 00:05:23.390]  government officials about what they claim are inflammatory and insulting public statements by Trump, according to senior U.S.
[00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.890]  officials.
[00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.052]  Officials from Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia have complained to recent private conversations about Trump's statements.
[00:05:29.392 --> 00:05:29.552]  U.S.
[00:05:29.612 --> 00:05:36.375]  officials said it was highly unusual for foreign diplomats to express concern, even privately, about candidates in the midst of a presidential campaign.
[00:05:36.675 --> 00:05:41.638]  Because they don't want to be seen as meddling in domestic politics, considering that they will have to work with whoever wins.
[00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:49.261]  Additionally, senior leaders in several countries, including Britain, Mexico, France, and Canada, have already made public comments criticizing Trump's positions.
[00:05:49.622 --> 00:05:50.502]  And that's a good thing.
[00:05:50.722 --> 00:05:54.304]  America needs to quit catering to foreign politicians who want to destroy U.S.
[00:05:54.344 --> 00:05:55.184]  national sovereignty.
[00:05:55.204 --> 00:05:59.106]  And America needs to be more concerned about the needs of the American citizen first before a foreign diplomat.
[00:05:59.246 --> 00:06:06.712]  There's way too many Americans out there living from paycheck to paycheck to worry about what a bunch of crybaby foreign diplomats say during their fancy lobster dinners paid for by taxpayers.
[00:06:07.032 --> 00:06:10.115]  This is Kit Daniels reporting for InfoWurst.com.
[00:06:10.635 --> 00:06:11.516]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[00:06:11.596 --> 00:06:11.996]  Good, brother.
[00:06:12.156 --> 00:06:13.858]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:06:13.878 --> 00:06:15.699]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:19.842]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:06:19.862 --> 00:06:22.424]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:06:22.464 --> 00:06:24.686]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:06:24.906 --> 00:06:26.948]  Super Mill Vitality was developed.
[00:06:27.188 --> 00:06:32.812]  To activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:06:33.073 --> 00:06:36.175]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:37.796]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:06:37.836 --> 00:06:40.759]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:42.240]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.962]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[00:06:45.262 --> 00:06:50.186]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum potency.
[00:06:50.386 --> 00:06:56.551]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience.
[00:06:56.832 --> 00:07:00.535]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[00:07:00.595 --> 00:07:02.336]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:07:02.376 --> 00:07:09.322]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:07:11.946 --> 00:07:15.367]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:07:15.727 --> 00:07:22.829]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:31.811]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:38.673]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water,
[00:07:38.933 --> 00:07:45.915]  ...into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:07:46.335 --> 00:07:49.416]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:07:49.736 --> 00:08:00.779]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:03.525]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[00:08:03.766 --> 00:08:06.712]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[00:08:06.873 --> 00:08:09.760]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[00:08:10.697 --> 00:08:12.859]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, Alex Jones here.
[00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:16.782]  I'm going to be live via Skype coming up during the noontime hour.
[00:08:16.842 --> 00:08:21.587]  Paul Joseph Watson is coming up in the next segment from London, England.
[00:08:22.467 --> 00:08:37.781]  Now, if you just joined us, I broke down the incredible racism, the incredible race war, the incredible divide and conquer, weaponized statements of Bernie Sanders saying white people don't know what it is like to be poor.
[00:08:37.861 --> 00:08:38.562]  Let's play that clip.
[00:08:39.864 --> 00:08:44.045]  You don't understand the degree to which we are terrorized.
[00:08:44.365 --> 00:08:53.107]  And I'm not just shooting, I'm not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and we've got to hold police officers accountable.
[00:08:53.627 --> 00:09:00.248]  I'm just talking about everyday activities where police officers are bullying people.
[00:09:01.149 --> 00:09:06.510]  So, to answer your question, I would say, and I think it's similar to what the Secretary said,
[00:09:07.307 --> 00:09:11.750]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[00:09:12.291 --> 00:09:14.612]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:09:14.973 --> 00:09:20.456]  You don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car.
[00:09:20.837 --> 00:09:21.557]  Think about that.
[00:09:22.158 --> 00:09:28.562]  This is a script, folks, when Beyonce is at the Super Bowl with all this race baiting.
[00:09:29.043 --> 00:09:32.025]  It's a script when the Pope says it's racist if you don't open your borders.
[00:09:32.585 --> 00:09:35.047]  It's a script when they have all the big rappers
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:37.360]  pushing this.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:42.421]  It's a script when they have the politicians out there promoting, go after the police, go after local government.
[00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:49.603]  This is the globalist collapsing borders, collapsing nation states, and bringing in third world populations that are weaponized.
[00:09:50.083 --> 00:09:56.164]  And also using indigenous populations and old beefs and old problems to then cause divide and conquer.
[00:09:56.204 --> 00:10:00.905]  Now I know you know that, but they're really doing it at a scale that is so brazen
[00:10:01.605 --> 00:10:06.254]  So out in the open, so naked, it really could backfire on them.
[00:10:06.494 --> 00:10:08.358]  The story's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:10:08.719 --> 00:10:13.127]  Sanders steps in and declares white people just don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:10:14.212 --> 00:10:18.654]  There are over 19 million white people under the poverty line.
[00:10:19.034 --> 00:10:30.619]  Sociologists and anthropologists have pointed out many times, you can look up the papers on this, that it's actually much higher because whites statistically are more prideful and do not like to get handouts and things like that.
[00:10:31.019 --> 00:10:38.082]  That's just a cultural thing and so a lot of whites live in poverty but basically live together with their parents or whatever and don't make a big deal out of it.
[00:10:38.102 --> 00:10:40.503]  So some estimates are that number is above 30 million.
[00:10:41.423 --> 00:10:46.086]  But regardless, there are twice as many poor whites as there are poor blacks.
[00:10:46.987 --> 00:10:59.956]  Ladies and gentlemen, that statement is so over-the-top, so disconnected from a bum like Bernie Sanders, who didn't have a paying job until he was 40 years old, in his own words, who's lived off other people's money.
[00:11:01.328 --> 00:11:15.460]  This is the elite playing class warfare and using race out in the open to distract the population, like blacks who have double the unemployment under Obama, to somehow blame it on the white guy next to them working at the factory.
[00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:23.207]  This is so sick, it's so evil, it is sowing seeds of unprecedented division and
[00:11:24.295 --> 00:11:26.297]  Shows you how truly evil these people are.
[00:11:26.637 --> 00:11:36.406]  And when you have a population that's so disconnected from reality, who's been so dumbed down as about half the public has, black, white, Hispanic, doesn't matter, it allows these type of lies to continue and flourish.
[00:11:36.666 --> 00:11:39.328]  There's a video up on InfoWars.com we're going to play in the second hour.
[00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:41.450]  It's on PrisonPlanet.com as well.
[00:11:42.051 --> 00:11:45.474]  With Mark Dice out there and the majority of people in California.
[00:11:46.727 --> 00:11:48.948]  Don't know what Washington, D.C.
[00:11:49.068 --> 00:11:49.748]  is named after.
[00:11:50.208 --> 00:11:56.630]  They don't know it's named after George Washington, first president of the United States, the guy who is on the dollar bill.
[00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.931]  They don't know any of that.
[00:11:59.131 --> 00:12:00.851]  They don't understand that.
[00:12:01.231 --> 00:12:03.532]  They are in their own world.
[00:12:04.392 --> 00:12:13.275]  And just hear racism, racism, just like they caught Democrats dressed up like basically Klan members and stuff saying that, you know, they hate Hispanics at Rand Paul events.
[00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:16.823]  They worked for the campaign that was running against him.
[00:12:18.083 --> 00:12:34.776]  Now, the anti-Trump people are going out handing out KKK signs and Heil Hitler signs at his events and even putting it on the news to then sit there and make quote minorities, or the majority in most areas, feel like whites are after him and people are trying to get him.
[00:12:36.155 --> 00:12:44.481]  Then that makes minorities who would be conservative or libertarian feel like they're not welcome at the Tea Party or welcome with people like Donald Trump.
[00:12:44.901 --> 00:12:50.444]  When the vast majority of the people that are involved with Donald Trump, I know them, I'd say 90% are not racist.
[00:12:51.525 --> 00:12:53.546]  Whites are the most un-racist group out there.
[00:12:53.667 --> 00:12:55.848]  I grew up in a very multicultural area of Dallas.
[00:12:56.148 --> 00:12:56.448]  I know.
[00:12:56.809 --> 00:12:58.270]  And there were some racist white people.
[00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:59.931]  They were few and far between.
[00:12:59.991 --> 00:13:04.794]  Most of them were guilty and self-loathing and hating and groveling to prove they weren't racist.
[00:13:05.595 --> 00:13:06.956]  That's pretty much how I was raised.
[00:13:07.016 --> 00:13:10.097]  I love my parents, but boy, I was raised, you know, with white guilt.
[00:13:11.658 --> 00:13:14.199]  Ladies and gentlemen, my parents don't have that guilt anymore.
[00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:16.200]  They've seen through all the propaganda and the brainwashing.
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.461]  And a lot of people are waking up to this as well.
[00:13:18.501 --> 00:13:19.662]  But we're not becoming racist.
[00:13:20.042 --> 00:13:22.863]  We're just realizing how we've been demonized and how we've been attacked.
[00:13:23.664 --> 00:13:25.545]  And so this is really out of control.
[00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:34.369]  Then you've got Glenn Beck on the other side, going on Stephanopoulos, the Democrat Party operative, former Chief of Staff for Clinton, and openly saying,
[00:13:35.319 --> 00:13:42.562]  Openly saying that what we see with Trump is like the Hitler phenomenon and the Nazis coming to power.
[00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:48.484]  This is a guy who said, arrest Ron Paul supporters, Ron Paul's dangerous, when he was at CNN and Fox.
[00:13:48.865 --> 00:13:54.387]  This is a guy who's always there, and I don't want to demonize him, I don't want to fight with Glenn Beck, but I just can't put up with it anymore.
[00:13:54.767 --> 00:14:01.890]  He says Ron Paul was right, and all this stuff, when he was the guy that tried to destroy Ron Paul in that clip, we're going to play that clip right now.
[00:14:03.052 --> 00:14:05.933]  The GOP has one last chance to listen to the people.
[00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:13.337]  And the people, and I understand it, they're very, very angry because the GOP did not listen the first time around.
[00:14:13.377 --> 00:14:18.760]  They didn't listen to the Ron Paul people who are way ahead of the curve, then the Tea Party people, and they rubbed our nose in it.
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.441]  And they are tired.
[00:14:20.561 --> 00:14:22.942]  And they have created Donald Trump.
[00:14:24.062 --> 00:14:27.064]  The people are speaking clearly, and there's two ways to go.
[00:14:27.424 --> 00:14:31.587]  Anger and nationalism, which has been done before in history.
[00:14:33.008 --> 00:14:35.769]  And you can go for nationalism, you can go for anger.
[00:14:35.789 --> 00:14:36.950]  Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler?
[00:14:38.591 --> 00:14:46.496]  If you look at what's happening with Donald Trump and his playing to the lowest common denominator and to the anger in us,
[00:14:47.256 --> 00:14:50.077]  You know, Adolf Hitler, we all look at Adolf Hitler in 1940.
[00:14:51.578 --> 00:14:53.659]  We should look at Adolf Hitler in 1929.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.302]  He was a kind of a funny kind of character that said the things that people were thinking.
[00:14:59.282 --> 00:15:02.464]  Where Donald Trump takes it, I have absolutely no idea.
[00:15:02.924 --> 00:15:06.526]  But Donald Trump is a dangerous man with the things that he has been saying.
[00:15:07.586 --> 00:15:14.773]  Americans have to see through this, but the very same paradigm of race war and divide and conquer is being played out in Europe as well.
[00:15:15.374 --> 00:15:18.878]  Now earlier I mentioned this is a prison policy system.
[00:15:19.478 --> 00:15:19.939]  That's what it is.
[00:15:20.479 --> 00:15:26.685]  The way they control prisons in Europe and the United States, where we have very diverse populations,
[00:15:27.643 --> 00:15:31.907]  Is they segregate people according to race and religion in some cases.
[00:15:32.467 --> 00:15:34.069]  They put the black Muslims over here.
[00:15:34.149 --> 00:15:35.850]  Blacks are basically forced to convert to Islam.
[00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:38.512]  They put the whites over here with the white supremacist.
[00:15:38.853 --> 00:15:43.957]  You're basically forced to get a swastika tattoo or they kill you or rape you.
[00:15:44.017 --> 00:15:45.858]  You're forced to join the Hispanic gangs.
[00:15:46.659 --> 00:15:55.647]  There are so few whites being born now and so few young whites that now the prisons, the white gangs, if your mother
[00:15:56.561 --> 00:15:57.347]  It was white.
[00:15:58.217 --> 00:15:59.377]  I guess they're following the Jewish thing.
[00:15:59.938 --> 00:16:00.978]  They consider you white.
[00:16:00.998 --> 00:16:02.778]  I guess because of the mitochondrial DNA.
[00:16:03.319 --> 00:16:11.281]  And then they will let Hispanics, blacks and others now join the white supremacists and choose that they want to be basically a division of that.
[00:16:11.741 --> 00:16:12.741]  That's what they're doing.
[00:16:12.801 --> 00:16:18.343]  So it's not based on free market, our country, not based on property, not based on family, not based on religious freedom.
[00:16:18.623 --> 00:16:24.905]  It's based on what race you are and the local mafia chief that works with the government who sits over you.
[00:16:25.145 --> 00:16:27.146]  The warden is the government, the federal government.
[00:16:28.368 --> 00:16:30.831]  And the states are like the jail guards and the local governments.
[00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:36.536]  And then we all are in a huge prison grid being surveilled and being watched, being played off against each other.
[00:16:36.797 --> 00:16:39.459]  And the British wrote books on the subject over 200 years ago.
[00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:41.541]  It's called The Great Game.
[00:16:42.122 --> 00:16:43.543]  Look up The Great Game.
[00:16:43.904 --> 00:16:47.868]  How they controlled India with the different tribes, the different religions, the different groups.
[00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:57.578]  In Africa, like in Nigeria, they have the prison-segregated Muslim, Christian, animist folks that worship nature, and that's how they control people.
[00:16:57.738 --> 00:17:00.961]  Very same genetics, very same background, they all kill each other.
[00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:08.509]  It's tribalism being manipulated and instilled for social engineering by sick people like Bernie Sanders.
[00:17:08.529 --> 00:17:11.252]  Let's play that clip one more time where he says white people
[00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.290]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:16.551]  Talk about racist, talk about demonizing whites.
[00:17:17.051 --> 00:17:18.291]  This is sick.
[00:17:19.531 --> 00:17:23.732]  You don't understand the degree to which we are terrorized.
[00:17:24.052 --> 00:17:32.794]  And I'm not just shooting, I'm not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen, which have got to end and we've got to hold police officers accountable.
[00:17:33.314 --> 00:17:39.895]  I'm just talking about everyday activities where police officers are bullying people.
[00:17:40.828 --> 00:17:51.436]  So to answer your question, I would say, and I think it's similar to what the Secretary said, when you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[00:17:51.996 --> 00:17:54.298]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:17:54.658 --> 00:18:00.162]  You don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car.
[00:18:01.303 --> 00:18:05.546]  So Glenn Beck says you're basically part of Hitler's movement if you support Trump.
[00:18:06.267 --> 00:18:08.809]  And the Democrats are handing out signs saying, Heil Hitler.
[00:18:09.833 --> 00:18:10.295]  At the event.
[00:18:10.335 --> 00:18:11.499]  See how they're all coordinated?
[00:18:12.423 --> 00:18:15.655]  And now Glenn Beck's the darling on ABC News and everywhere else.
[00:18:16.667 --> 00:18:18.349]  This is how they have controlled opposition.
[00:18:18.869 --> 00:18:40.949]  And I was told by insiders at Fox six years ago, and by people that have worked for Beck, these aren't disgruntled folks, these are people that have gone on to run major companies, and who were big before they ever met Beck, that Glenn Beck was designed to be the anti-Alex Jones, and that Glenn Beck is obsessed with me, and tracks everything we do, and tries to co-op what we do, and is there basically to destroy the Liberty message and control it.
[00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:45.754]  Now, I've always said he still does some good, but overall he doesn't do good now.
[00:18:45.814 --> 00:18:46.996]  He's trying to kill populism.
[00:18:47.516 --> 00:18:48.457]  I like Ted Cruz.
[00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:51.981]  And I realize why I've started to not like Ted Cruz is because Glenn Beck supports him.
[00:18:52.721 --> 00:19:02.411]  And I think that's the cherry on top of why I don't trust Ted Cruz with his CFR wife and Goldman Sachs background being top Bush insiders who help write trade deals and the rest of it.
[00:19:03.232 --> 00:19:05.874]  Is that you have the globalist history where he came from.
[00:19:05.914 --> 00:19:07.275]  He's been good since he's been in the Senate.
[00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:09.476]  But he could be the ultimate sleeper cell.
[00:19:09.836 --> 00:19:12.097]  I trust him less than Donald Trump.
[00:19:12.137 --> 00:19:14.579]  And let's be clear, I'm watching Donald Trump closely.
[00:19:14.879 --> 00:19:17.501]  But the globalists are legitimately scared to death of him for a reason.
[00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:22.564]  And that's why they're using weaponized media and really brutal, sick tactics against folks.
[00:19:23.084 --> 00:19:24.044]  I talked about it yesterday.
[00:19:24.064 --> 00:19:26.286]  I'll talk about it more when I'm live with Watson in the next hour.
[00:19:27.026 --> 00:19:43.684]  But I'm talking to friends, family, neighbors, you name it, where people are singing Beyonce, mainly young black kids, 11, 12, 13, 14, at parks and in schools and on the streets and breaking into things and threatening to attack people and just coming up to white groups of people and getting in their faces.
[00:19:44.224 --> 00:19:48.186]  Saying black power, why do you better get out of here in just mainstream areas?
[00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:49.726]  This is so sad.
[00:19:49.866 --> 00:19:50.647]  It's so hurtful.
[00:19:51.187 --> 00:19:51.947]  It's such division.
[00:19:51.967 --> 00:19:58.790]  Just like the Klan embarrasses me, black folks need to be embarrassed of these racists that have been programmed, these young idiots, and reach out to them and explain what's happening.
[00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:02.011]  We'll be back on the other side with Paul Joseph Watson live from London.
[00:20:02.252 --> 00:20:05.393]  Then I'll be back Skyping and coming up in the noon hour and more.
[00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:05.873]  Stay with us.
[00:20:06.153 --> 00:20:10.195]  If you're watching this transmission, no matter what race, color or creed you are, you are the resistance.
[00:20:13.976 --> 00:20:18.342]  Hey, I rode the elevator with you, but I don't work on the upper floors.
[00:20:18.762 --> 00:20:21.065]  I just want to squeeze in there right next to you.
[00:20:21.345 --> 00:20:25.310]  So the RFID scanner in my pocket can capture all your personal information.
[00:20:25.631 --> 00:20:28.715]  Your debit and credit cards, even your work ID badge.
[00:20:29.135 --> 00:20:31.498]  So your identity is now my identity.
[00:20:32.079 --> 00:20:32.519]  Going up.
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:41.383]  So am I. For over 10 years, ID Stronghold has pioneered RFID-blocking wallets and ID badge holders for consumers, the U.S.
[00:20:41.423 --> 00:20:44.164]  military, and even the Executive Office of the President.
[00:20:44.705 --> 00:20:46.205]  Shouldn't you be protected too?
[00:20:46.845 --> 00:20:51.507]  ID Stronghold wallets cost about the same as wallets in most stores, but give you extra protection.
[00:20:51.827 --> 00:20:54.528]  I'm Wal Augustinowitz, founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[00:20:54.848 --> 00:20:56.749]  Don't be a victim of electronic pickpocketing.

[00:21:26.877 --> 00:21:29.520]  No more than 18% utilization of protein.
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.783]  One World Way also delivers life-giving frequencies to your cells.
[00:21:32.903 --> 00:21:38.308]  The net result for so many people is improved energy, mood, and elimination of pain from inflammation.

[00:21:42.892 --> 00:21:49.254]  I'm 36 years old, and for the past several years, I've been struggling with lack of energy, drive, and stamina.
[00:21:49.494 --> 00:21:53.275]  And after just two weeks on this product, I'm feeling so much more energy.
[00:21:53.336 --> 00:21:59.277]  My yoga practice has deepened, and as a massage therapist, I'm able to see more clients than I've been able to in a year.
[00:21:59.598 --> 00:22:02.639]  I've never felt results that quick with anything I've ever taken.

[00:22:40.293 --> 00:22:43.035]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:22:43.336 --> 00:22:45.958]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:22:45.978 --> 00:22:46.398]  Croix River.
[00:22:46.718 --> 00:22:48.720]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.682]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:22:51.902 --> 00:22:52.443]  His excuse?
[00:22:52.783 --> 00:22:53.864]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:22:54.124 --> 00:22:55.405]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:22:55.745 --> 00:23:01.230]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[00:24:26.249 --> 00:24:31.211]  We are back live on the March 7th, 2016 edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:31.271 --> 00:24:32.752]  I'm your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:24:33.312 --> 00:24:39.014]  Alex will be back with a news update at the bottom of the second hour, so be sure to tune in for that.
[00:24:39.674 --> 00:24:51.999]  But before that, coming up later this hour, I've got Gad Saad, the behavioral scientist out of John Molson School of Business in Concordia University, Quebec, Canada, and he's going to talk about the
[00:24:52.699 --> 00:25:05.806]  Tyranny of political correctness as it envelops college campuses, as the social justice warriors take over with their authoritarianism, while preaching tolerance.
[00:25:05.966 --> 00:25:20.475]  And now they're actually saying that people who disagree with them, people who go to universities and give speeches, people like Milo Yiannopoulos and Ben Shapiro, are committing an act of violence simply for having a different opinion.
[00:25:21.235 --> 00:25:22.197]  So we're going to get into that.
[00:25:22.237 --> 00:25:25.862]  We've also got Lauren Southern coming on in the third hour.
[00:25:25.882 --> 00:25:28.466]  Now on Saturday night, she went to an event.
[00:25:29.639 --> 00:25:34.063]  Which was attended by these very same liberal tolerant social justice warriors.
[00:25:34.443 --> 00:25:45.072]  She, God forbid, disagreed with their opinion, said that there were only two genders, said that there are only men and women in the world and there wasn't a third gender.
[00:25:45.712 --> 00:25:53.278]  They responded with all their tolerance and warm fuzzy liberal virtues by dumping urine over her head.
[00:25:53.979 --> 00:25:55.400]  They actually assaulted her.
[00:25:55.901 --> 00:25:57.723]  We're going to go to that video in the third hour.
[00:25:58.063 --> 00:26:00.585]  We're going to talk to Lauren Southern about that.
[00:26:00.646 --> 00:26:06.711]  So we've got a packed show coming up on this Monday edition, which is why I need to rattle through the news right now.
[00:26:07.732 --> 00:26:10.755]  Of course, you just heard Alex there in the first couple of segments.
[00:26:11.616 --> 00:26:21.518]  Talking about this amazing quote by Bernie Sanders which came out during the debate where he said basically that white people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:26:22.118 --> 00:26:29.240]  We know why he's saying that because of course Hillary Clinton has more of the black vote than Bernie Sanders as of this moment.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.501]  He's trying to pander to black voters to get their approval.
[00:26:34.221 --> 00:26:46.868]  But he's doing it again in a way which remains the only acceptable form of racism in the West in 2016, which is to discriminate against and mock, basically, white people.
[00:26:47.449 --> 00:26:54.413]  They're the only people that it's now acceptable to be racist against without receiving any significant backlash.
[00:26:54.433 --> 00:26:57.354]  So, I mean, Alex explained that pretty much in detail.
[00:26:57.975 --> 00:26:59.836]  To layer some facts on top of that,
[00:27:01.001 --> 00:27:10.028]  The claim that white people don't know what it's like to be poor is, of course, completely ludicrous, as TheRoot.com reports and many other news outlets are reporting today.
[00:27:11.028 --> 00:27:20.035]  Census figures out of 2013 show that 18.9 million white people in America are poor.
[00:27:20.495 --> 00:27:24.618]  That's 8 million more poor white people than poor black people.
[00:27:25.659 --> 00:27:28.982]  5 million more than those who identify as Latino.
[00:27:29.662 --> 00:27:36.445]  And in fact, 70% of African-Americans in America are not classified as poor.
[00:27:37.005 --> 00:27:47.330]  So in fact, after this Bernie Sanders quote, you had a lot of African-Americans come out and basically say, why is he using this to basically imply that all African-Americans are poor?
[00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:55.554]  These people have worked hard in many cases to get out of poverty, and yet he's still pigeonholing African-Americans into that category.
[00:27:56.334 --> 00:28:11.235]  By asserting, by claiming that white people have no idea whatsoever what it's like to struggle, what it's like to be on the breadline, when in fact 10 million, more than 10 million more white people are poor in America compared to black people.
[00:28:12.025 --> 00:28:21.869]  Now of course, African Americans are disproportionately more poor, but that doesn't mean for a second that there are no poor white people in America.
[00:28:22.529 --> 00:28:31.493]  And again, if you look at another metric of this, as the Huffington Post reports, again, not a right-wing news outlet, the Huffington Post, you look at food stamps.
[00:28:33.095 --> 00:28:39.249]  40% of food stamps go to white people, compared to 25% for Americans and 10% for Hispanics.
[00:28:42.981 --> 00:28:55.370]  So yes, there are disproportionately more African-American and Hispanic people on food stamps in America, but there are almost double the number of white people on food stamps in America.
[00:28:55.831 --> 00:29:05.898]  White people know very well what it's like to be poor, and in fact many of the most poor areas in America are populated by white people.
[00:29:06.559 --> 00:29:07.560]  So not only was it a
[00:29:08.527 --> 00:29:22.902]  You know, a ludicrous attack pandering to get black votes by denigrating white people and in a sense denigrating black people by implying that they're all on food stamps and welfare when 70% of black people aren't.
[00:29:23.042 --> 00:29:24.123]  They're not in poverty.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:32.987]  It was completely factually inaccurate and Bernie Sanders has basically been completely debunked on that argument across the media today.
[00:29:33.668 --> 00:29:38.752]  But again, it just shows they will stoop to any lengths to pander to get the vote.
[00:29:39.413 --> 00:29:45.698]  And it's only acceptable to do so in the context of being racist when that racism targets white people.
[00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:52.222]  Bernie Sanders has been completely demolished with this narrative within hours of saying it during the debate.
[00:29:52.782 --> 00:29:54.263]  We'll be back with more news.
[00:29:54.283 --> 00:29:57.545]  This is the Alex Jones Show live in 4Wars.com.
[00:29:57.565 --> 00:29:58.205]  Don't go away.
[00:30:00.146 --> 00:30:01.047]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.547 --> 00:30:03.168]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.088 --> 00:30:06.750]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.779 --> 00:30:14.802]  Donald Trump is shaking up the world order, and that's something we've needed for a very long time.
[00:30:15.042 --> 00:30:17.605]  For one thing, foreign diplomats are expressing alarm to U.S.
[00:30:17.665 --> 00:30:23.529]  government officials about what they claim are inflammatory and insulting public statements by Trump, according to senior U.S.
[00:30:23.589 --> 00:30:24.010]  officials.
[00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:29.174]  Officials from Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia have complained to recent private conversations about Trump's statements.
[00:30:29.514 --> 00:30:29.674]  U.S.
[00:30:29.734 --> 00:30:36.497]  officials said it was highly unusual for foreign diplomats to express concern, even privately, about candidates in the midst of a presidential campaign.
[00:30:36.797 --> 00:30:41.759]  Because they don't want to be seen as meddling in domestic politics, considering that they will have to work with whoever wins.
[00:30:42.059 --> 00:30:49.382]  Additionally, senior leaders in several countries, including Britain, Mexico, France, and Canada, have already made public comments criticizing Trump's positions.
[00:30:49.742 --> 00:30:50.623]  And that's a good thing.
[00:30:50.843 --> 00:30:54.424]  America needs to quit catering to foreign politicians who want to destroy U.S.
[00:30:54.464 --> 00:30:55.304]  national sovereignty.
[00:30:55.324 --> 00:30:59.226]  And America needs to be more concerned about the needs of American citizens first, before a foreign diplomat.
[00:30:59.366 --> 00:31:06.814]  There's way too many Americans out there living from paycheck to paycheck to worry about what a bunch of crybaby foreign diplomats say during their fancy lobster dinners paid for by taxpayers.
[00:31:07.154 --> 00:31:10.257]  This is Kit Daniels reporting for InfoWurst.com.
[00:31:10.717 --> 00:31:13.921]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:31:14.221 --> 00:31:19.206]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[00:31:19.266 --> 00:31:19.726]  I don't know.
[00:31:40.729 --> 00:31:41.510]  Shower filters.
[00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.252]  We're introducing the best yet.
[00:31:43.372 --> 00:31:47.296]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high performance shower filter.
[00:31:47.437 --> 00:31:52.062]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong powerful flow.
[00:31:52.262 --> 00:31:59.190]  This new four stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.

[00:32:10.486 --> 00:32:16.896]  Our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:32:17.327 --> 00:32:20.468]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[00:32:20.728 --> 00:32:26.770]  Needed to get my digestive system working correctly again, so I stumbled on the X2.
[00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:30.270]  We look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2.
[00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:34.031]  It's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[00:32:34.352 --> 00:32:36.072]  I needed a detox basically.
[00:32:38.041 --> 00:32:40.603]  For about seven days and then I did the deep cleanse.
[00:32:41.084 --> 00:32:44.546]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[00:32:44.747 --> 00:32:45.787]  What do you have to lose?
[00:32:46.068 --> 00:32:54.635]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[00:32:55.095 --> 00:32:58.579]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[00:32:58.659 --> 00:33:00.461]  I was like really more natural.
[00:33:00.721 --> 00:33:05.746]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:33:20.447 --> 00:33:22.149]  You want answers?
[00:33:22.209 --> 00:33:23.190]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:25.352]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.212 --> 00:33:36.233]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:36.293 --> 00:33:42.798]  We're going to get into some more news here in a moment, but I want to direct you to InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:43.718 --> 00:33:46.520]  And I want to direct you specifically to Brain Force.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.163]  The InfoWars crew, basically a lot of them have given you their testimonials.
[00:33:51.223 --> 00:33:57.948]  Rob Dew took Brain Force and was able to pull an all-nighter and finish the entire Louis Farrakhan video, no mean feat.
[00:33:57.988 --> 00:33:59.569]  He's talked about that on the show before.
[00:34:00.319 --> 00:34:05.003]  I took brain force personally when I came over to visit Austin last year.
[00:34:05.423 --> 00:34:08.186]  Again, I was completely jet-lagged, completely tired.
[00:34:08.786 --> 00:34:18.194]  Of course, I was hosting the show the next day, so I had to get my brain into gear on basically three hours sleep, completely jet-lagged, completely out of it.
[00:34:18.754 --> 00:34:20.115]  Took two brain force
[00:34:20.876 --> 00:34:22.657]  And again, I was completely energised.
[00:34:22.717 --> 00:34:29.760]  It made me focus, it gave me mental clarity, and enabled me to have a better insight into the news I was talking about.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.141]  And it really helped.
[00:34:31.681 --> 00:34:34.282]  So I really had felt that effect from BrainForce.
[00:34:35.043 --> 00:34:37.624]  It's available at infowarslife.com.

[00:35:11.002 --> 00:35:20.687]  It's worked for me, it's worked for numerous other people in the InfoWars office, which is why we're proud to encourage you to get it at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:35:33.954 --> 00:35:44.264]  All this gets piled back into the operation, and we couldn't have achieved anything that we've achieved over the last 10-15 years or so without your support.
[00:35:44.304 --> 00:35:49.289]  And you can go to the website, inforwarslife.com, and see all the testimonials.
[00:35:49.649 --> 00:35:54.734]  Independent people who have taken this, and it's had a huge benefit in their own personal life.
[00:35:55.555 --> 00:36:01.300]  So it's not just us saying it, it's other people verifying that and giving you their own personal story.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:02.621]  So that's Brainforce.
[00:36:03.002 --> 00:36:08.346]  Again, 10% off when you select AutoShip before checkout at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:36:09.875 --> 00:36:12.996]  Now Alex mentioned it back during his segment.
[00:36:13.677 --> 00:36:19.679]  Glenn Beck basically came out and parroted this rhetoric that we've been hearing for weeks and weeks now.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.601]  That Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler.
[00:36:23.801 --> 00:36:25.162]  And it goes something like this.
[00:36:25.282 --> 00:36:26.643]  It's very simple.
[00:36:27.163 --> 00:36:28.944]  It's not very complex to understand.
[00:36:29.384 --> 00:36:29.704]  Okay.
[00:36:30.384 --> 00:36:32.685]  Adolf Hitler was popular.
[00:36:34.006 --> 00:36:36.107]  Donald Trump is also popular.
[00:36:37.247 --> 00:36:39.469]  Therefore Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler.
[00:36:40.169 --> 00:36:41.651]  That's basically the level.
[00:36:42.071 --> 00:36:43.732]  It doesn't go much deeper than this.
[00:36:44.273 --> 00:36:46.975]  And it's something we're hearing from both the right and the left.
[00:36:47.816 --> 00:36:49.517]  This is an article out of Gateway Pundit.
[00:36:50.238 --> 00:36:57.344]  Disgusting new low Trump haters pass around fake pic of Trump supporters raising Nazi salute.
[00:36:58.331 --> 00:37:04.514]  My God, those devious Trump supporters have been caught seek-hiling at one of Trump's events.
[00:37:05.274 --> 00:37:06.855]  This is a shocking precedent.
[00:37:06.915 --> 00:37:11.677]  Surely this proves that Donald Trump is dangerous potential next dictator of America.
[00:37:12.358 --> 00:37:13.738]  He's the new Adolf Hitler, right?
[00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:25.404]  Well, it turns out that Trump asked his supporters at this event on Saturday in Orlando, Florida, to raise their hand if they were going to vote for Donald Trump.
[00:37:26.331 --> 00:37:27.993]  So you can see the picture in this article.
[00:37:28.813 --> 00:37:33.277]  You know, about 10, 20 people in the picture are raising their hand.
[00:37:33.637 --> 00:37:35.699]  Hands up if you're going to vote for Trump.
[00:37:35.799 --> 00:37:36.740]  They raised their hand.
[00:37:37.201 --> 00:37:39.042]  That's not a Nazi salute.
[00:37:39.903 --> 00:37:53.175]  Yet for the past 48 hours this has been passed around left-wing blogs and Twitter as proof, bombshell proof, that Donald Trump supporters were seaguiling at a Donald Trump event.
[00:37:54.312 --> 00:37:56.713]  This is the simplicity of the propaganda.
[00:37:56.833 --> 00:37:58.794]  It's brazen lies.
[00:37:58.894 --> 00:37:59.875]  It's in your face.
[00:38:00.435 --> 00:38:06.338]  But it's, again, in line with this narrative, this very simplistic narrative, that Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler.
[00:38:06.758 --> 00:38:08.739]  Now, you can say what you like about Donald Trump.
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:16.724]  You can say, as I would, that his views on torture, his views on government surveillance, are completely abhorrent, which they are.
[00:38:17.444 --> 00:38:18.945]  But he's not Adolf Hitler.
[00:38:19.929 --> 00:38:27.552]  That would be like arguing that every German in the 1940s was a member of the Nazi Party and supported Adolf Hitler.
[00:38:27.792 --> 00:38:34.214]  Only 15% of Germans at around that time he came to power were members of the Nazi Party.
[00:38:35.134 --> 00:38:39.756]  So they just use this tactic over and over again and again it's coming from both left and right.
[00:38:40.646 --> 00:38:50.012]  When in actual fact we see many developments, we see polls of support for people who are going to vote for Donald Trump that counter this very narrative.
[00:38:50.693 --> 00:38:52.534]  We had this again over the weekend.
[00:38:53.234 --> 00:38:58.478]  Sikhs and Muslims hold rally in DC in support of Donald J Trump.
[00:38:59.318 --> 00:39:02.039]  Sikhs and Muslims gathered in a suburb of Washington, D.C.
[00:39:02.059 --> 00:39:05.481]  this weekend to support Donald Trump for President.
[00:39:06.082 --> 00:39:10.364]  The group had Muslims for Trump and Sikhs for Trump signs made for the event.
[00:39:11.064 --> 00:39:15.086]  A representative of the Trump campaign addressed the gathering.
[00:39:15.586 --> 00:39:20.269]  The event organizer told reporters, quote, So in many cases, these are immigrants who have worked hard
[00:39:28.902 --> 00:39:34.705]  Who have come into the country legally at no meagre expense and hassle to themselves.
[00:39:34.785 --> 00:39:44.030]  They've been through the process, which of course in many cases takes years and years to emigrate to the United States, to become citizens in some cases.
[00:39:44.611 --> 00:39:46.712]  They're angry that this proposal
[00:39:47.492 --> 00:40:04.639]  As Obama has said it now, with tens of thousands of quote, refugees coming into America, up to 100,000 at least, God knows how many that's going to be in the end, of these economic migrants coming into America, and again, not being vetted, despite the fact that
[00:40:05.706 --> 00:40:11.851]  As the Paris Massacre showed, these terrorists are infiltrating themselves amongst these refugees.
[00:40:11.911 --> 00:40:16.234]  And in some cases, radicalising the quote, refugees.
[00:40:16.555 --> 00:40:21.679]  Which doesn't take a lot of convincing with some of them, when they already arrived in the West.
[00:40:22.389 --> 00:40:26.711]  With pictures of beheadings and ISIS flags on their mobile phones.
[00:40:27.271 --> 00:40:29.212]  So of course these people should be vetted.
[00:40:29.973 --> 00:40:32.834]  And again, Trump outlined his policy, he clarified it.
[00:40:33.134 --> 00:40:36.356]  He was not going to ban all Muslim migration to the United States.
[00:40:36.396 --> 00:40:42.678]  He was going to have a temporary period where that would happen and this whole process would be properly vetted.
[00:40:44.019 --> 00:40:50.002]  So now we've got Muslim groups, we've got Sikhs, we've got minority groups who are coming out in support of Donald Trump.
[00:40:51.084 --> 00:40:53.367]  In greater and greater numbers.
[00:40:54.188 --> 00:40:59.634]  This is a poll from CARE, again, the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
[00:40:59.715 --> 00:41:01.637]  This is not a bias organisation.
[00:41:02.338 --> 00:41:08.826]  Donald Trump has more Muslim support than all remaining GOP candidates combined.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:21.104]  Back in December, Council on American-Islamic Relations, the unindicted co-conspirators of the Holy Land Foundation trial, weighed in on Donald Trump's proposed ban on Muslim immigration to the United States.
[00:41:21.825 --> 00:41:25.186]  Until the government can figure out, quote, what the hell is going on.
[00:41:25.746 --> 00:41:26.867]  Those were Trump's words.
[00:41:27.847 --> 00:41:30.008]  And of course, CAIR leaders were outraged.
[00:41:30.368 --> 00:41:37.271]  Executive Director Nihad Awad called Donald Trump a leader of a lynch mob who is doing the work of ISIS.
[00:41:38.595 --> 00:41:51.260]  Alright, so he's trying to vet Muslim migrants coming into the country because ISIS members have openly said they will use this economic wave of migrants to infiltrate terrorists into the West.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:57.102]  But no, it's Donald Trump who's doing the work of ISIS by trying to prevent that from happening.
[00:41:58.083 --> 00:42:00.524]  Well, this poll that CARE themselves conducted
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:06.163]  Kind of debunked that narrative that Muslims hate Donald Trump.
[00:42:06.864 --> 00:42:08.866]  This was a poll from March the 1st.
[00:42:09.386 --> 00:42:14.570]  You look at the Republican candidates and the percentage who said they would vote for Donald Trump.
[00:42:15.711 --> 00:42:16.612]  John Kasich, 1%.
[00:42:16.932 --> 00:42:17.192]  Ted Cruz, 2%.
[00:42:17.252 --> 00:42:17.753]  Marco Rubio, 4%.
[00:42:18.313 --> 00:42:19.014]  Donald Trump, 11%.
[00:42:26.678 --> 00:42:31.641]  Of course, the vast majority of these Muslims said they would vote for Clinton or Sanders because most of them are Democrats.
[00:42:32.482 --> 00:42:40.186]  But Donald Trump has more support from Muslims in the United States than all of the other GOP candidates combined.
[00:42:41.347 --> 00:42:42.047]  Than all of them.
[00:42:42.608 --> 00:42:44.129]  More than double of Rubio.
[00:42:45.269 --> 00:42:52.634]  So again, this narrative that he's the new Adolf Hitler, that he's going to put Muslims or put Mexicans in concentration camps,
[00:42:53.908 --> 00:42:58.030]  A lot of Muslims, a lot of Muslim Americans simply don't believe that rhetoric.
[00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:02.732]  And again, it gets to what we were talking about with Bernie Sanders before.
[00:43:03.633 --> 00:43:12.156]  They don't get it that a lot of Trump supporters are poor people because they don't feel represented by the likes of Hillary Clinton.
[00:43:12.196 --> 00:43:15.118]  They don't feel they're going to be represented by Marco Rubio.
[00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:18.231]  We have this article again out of Gateway Pundit.
[00:43:19.151 --> 00:43:24.894]  1,000 blue-collar workers switch parties to vote for Donald Trump in Youngstown, Ohio.
[00:43:25.514 --> 00:43:34.858]  At least 1,000 blue-collar Democrats in Mahon County have switched parties from Democrat to Republican to vote for Donald Trump in the primary.
[00:43:35.658 --> 00:43:37.739]  And this is a relatively small county.
[00:43:38.888 --> 00:43:45.634]  There in Ohio, 1,000 people, blue collar, again switched to vote for Donald Trump.
[00:43:46.254 --> 00:44:00.206]  If you actually read why people are voting for Donald Trump, it's not because they're racists, it's not because they're bigots, it's not because they think all Mexicans are rapists and drug dealers, as the media has tried to frame it.
[00:44:00.822 --> 00:44:19.376]  It's because of a myriad of reasons, and the fact that Trump represents them, even though you could argue that he's just a rich buffoon, more so than any other single candidate, because he's outside of the establishment system that has betrayed these people from all across the spectrum, over and over again.
[00:44:19.396 --> 00:44:22.979]  There's an article out of Liberty Blitzkrieg, you should read this in full.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.542]  Trump supporters, in their own words,
[00:44:27.682 --> 00:44:31.664]  So again, they go and talk to the people who are actually voting for Trump.
[00:44:32.244 --> 00:44:37.026]  And no, they're not all racist right-wing hillbillies who hate Muslims and Mexicans.
[00:44:37.467 --> 00:44:38.527]  Surprise, surprise.
[00:44:39.528 --> 00:44:40.188]  Here's one of them.
[00:44:40.528 --> 00:44:49.372]  The gay Arab Muslim student, 20 years old from Missouri, he says his parents are horrified at the fact that he's going to vote for Donald Trump.
[00:44:50.213 --> 00:44:52.734]  Not the typical Trump supporter, you would think.
[00:44:54.363 --> 00:44:58.645]  The article says, as a gay Muslim, the Republican Party has not been kind to me, to say the least.
[00:44:58.685 --> 00:45:07.249]  However, the Democrats almost arrogantly expect me to hand my vote to them because of who I am, which insults me.
[00:45:08.009 --> 00:45:12.051]  I'm a son of immigrants, but we have always followed the law to the letter.
[00:45:12.632 --> 00:45:16.153]  Donald Trump's discussion on immigration is extremely relevant.
[00:45:16.313 --> 00:45:21.716]  Again, this is a 20-year-old gay Arab Muslim student saying this.
[00:45:22.964 --> 00:45:32.187]  Quote, I even support the temporary ban on Muslims, even though I still have many law-abiding family members in Syria who deserve the opportunity to come to the US and escape the horrors of war.
[00:45:32.767 --> 00:45:34.928]  We don't vet these people properly.
[00:45:35.228 --> 00:45:37.909]  To let them in willy-nilly is ludicrous.
[00:45:38.969 --> 00:45:44.631]  That's a 20-year-old gay Arab Muslim student who's saying he's going to vote for Trump because he supports that.
[00:45:45.311 --> 00:45:52.433]  Quote, Trump will break the poisonous bonds that hold America and the cult of Saudi Arabia together.
[00:45:53.595 --> 00:46:05.543]  Meanwhile, you know, people like Hillary Clinton, people like Jeb Bush, still withholding, showing no interest whatsoever in those 28 pages that implicate Saudi Arabia in 9-11.
[00:46:07.004 --> 00:46:08.825]  Clinton would never do that, he continues.
[00:46:08.865 --> 00:46:13.548]  She would continue supporting Saudi Arabia while bombing Islamic countries left and right.
[00:46:14.448 --> 00:46:15.789]  And that's exactly the case.
[00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:18.812]  Trump, from the beginning, was against the Iraq War.
[00:46:19.072 --> 00:46:30.042]  People like Hillary Clinton, you know, celebrated Muammar Gaddafi's death, which led to this spiral of the migration crisis, which now threatens the West.
[00:46:30.748 --> 00:46:31.868]  Trump is against that.
[00:46:32.248 --> 00:46:34.269]  He's against military adventurism.
[00:46:34.789 --> 00:46:40.150]  And that's why many of these usually left-wingers are throwing their support behind him.
[00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:51.893]  This is really interesting to read, all these people who are voting for Trump, because they don't fit into these cookie-cutter boxes that the media would try to convince you makes up the vast majority of Trump's support.
[00:46:52.813 --> 00:46:53.733]  So here's another one.
[00:46:54.673 --> 00:46:56.934]  The anti-PC college professor
[00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:59.752]  This is a 50-year-old guy from California.
[00:47:00.252 --> 00:47:02.774]  Quote, I'm angry at forced diversity.
[00:47:02.874 --> 00:47:05.797]  He explains again why he's voting for Trump.
[00:47:06.698 --> 00:47:10.160]  I'm a liberal left college professor in the social sciences.
[00:47:10.681 --> 00:47:14.824]  I'm going to vote for Trump, but I won't tell hardly anybody.
[00:47:15.485 --> 00:47:18.808]  My main reason is anger at the two-party system.
[00:47:18.828 --> 00:47:22.351]  Again, this is a leftist liberal professor from California.
[00:47:23.567 --> 00:47:25.988]  And the horrible presidencies of Obama and Bush.
[00:47:26.008 --> 00:47:30.571]  But I'm also furious at political correctness on campus and in the media.
[00:47:31.652 --> 00:47:41.657]  So we've had the articles before where, you know, leftist liberal professors are, well, terrified of their own students, but they daren't speak out against it.
[00:47:41.918 --> 00:47:44.459]  What we're going to talk about with Gad Saad here coming up soon.
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:49.122]  But this is a guy who's going to speak out against it by voting for Trump.
[00:47:50.049 --> 00:47:59.135]  He continues, I'm angry at forced diversity, constant frequently unjustified complaints about racism, sexism, homophobia, lack of trans rights.
[00:47:59.776 --> 00:48:08.442]  I'm particularly angry at social justice warriors and my main reason to vote Trump is to see the looks on your faces when he wins.
[00:48:09.102 --> 00:48:12.924]  It's not that I like Trump, it's that I hate those who can't stand him.
[00:48:13.524 --> 00:48:25.950]  Which again strikes at the root of the fact that these regressive leftists, these new fascists who call themselves anti-fascists, are so reprehensible in their behaviour.
[00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:29.933]  Which we've seen in, you know, college campuses over the past few weeks.
[00:48:30.714 --> 00:48:41.402]  So reprehensible in their hatred for free speech and their efforts to shut it down via censorship and in some cases physical or violence.
[00:48:42.283 --> 00:48:52.592]  They're so hated now that even left-wing liberal college professors say that they're going to vote for Donald Trump simply to see the look on their faces.
[00:48:54.178 --> 00:48:56.681]  So you've got Arab Muslims, 20-year-old students.
[00:48:57.462 --> 00:49:01.787]  You've got 50-year-old left-wing college professors in California.
[00:49:02.107 --> 00:49:05.451]  You've got retired biomedical engineers from Hawaii.
[00:49:06.112 --> 00:49:13.520]  You've got a 29-year-old yoga teacher who says that he voted for Barack Obama, now he's going to vote for Trump.
[00:49:14.502 --> 00:49:18.764]  But he doesn't want to tell his girlfriend because, you know, it might not be socially acceptable.
[00:49:19.264 --> 00:49:37.872]  But behind the scenes, all these people who you would expect to be, you know, flagrant liberals, Hillary Clinton voters perhaps, they've become educated, they've become so turned off by the regressive left, by a political establishment that doesn't represent them, and that's why they're voting for Trump.
[00:49:37.912 --> 00:49:43.335]  They're not voting for Trump because they're racist bigots who hate Mexicans and Muslims.
[00:49:44.343 --> 00:49:50.588]  They're voting for Trump because he's the only candidate they think actually represents them in any way imaginable.
[00:49:51.469 --> 00:49:54.591]  So again, it demolishes this rhetoric that we've heard over and over again.
[00:49:55.312 --> 00:49:58.234]  It demolishes the rhetoric we're hearing out of this Reuters report.
[00:49:59.155 --> 00:50:01.316]  Foreign diplomats voicing alarm to U.S.
[00:50:01.356 --> 00:50:02.557]  officials about Trump.
[00:50:03.198 --> 00:50:05.179]  Foreign diplomats are expressing alarm to U.S.
[00:50:05.219 --> 00:50:12.225]  government officials about what they say are inflammatory and insulting public statements by Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump.
[00:50:13.311 --> 00:50:33.401]  So again, they're not alarmed about the fact we've had a political establishment for decades that has invaded foreign countries, overthrown secular governments, brought in Islamic radicals, created a migrant crisis, a humanitarian disaster, the likes of which we haven't seen for generations.
[00:50:34.181 --> 00:50:37.685]  They're not concerned about a political establishment that is interested in that.
[00:50:38.086 --> 00:50:44.393]  They're concerned about Donald Trump making politically incorrect statements during his speeches.
[00:50:45.379 --> 00:50:48.520]  And using that to claim that he's Hitler.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:58.144]  Well, I'd be more concerned about a military-industrial complex that has overthrown these secular dictators, that has killed millions of people, that has created a humanitarian disaster.
[00:50:58.564 --> 00:51:03.646]  I would be more concerned about trying to avoid that outcome once again.
[00:51:04.246 --> 00:51:06.967]  And many Donald Trump supporters feel the same way.
[00:51:07.027 --> 00:51:10.329]  We'll be back after the break on the Alex Jones Show GADSTAT coming up.
[00:51:10.409 --> 00:51:10.909]  Stay tuned.
[00:51:11.129 --> 00:51:12.770]  This is not an offering to sell a franchise.

[00:52:12.116 --> 00:52:14.316]  Think body armor is just for commandos?
[00:52:14.657 --> 00:52:15.257]  Think again.
[00:52:15.617 --> 00:52:18.897]  In a collapse situation, you need to protect your entire family.

[00:53:10.327 --> 00:53:13.809]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:15.069]  It's true.
[00:53:15.189 --> 00:53:19.111]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:53:19.331 --> 00:53:21.192]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:53:21.732 --> 00:53:26.194]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[00:53:26.494 --> 00:53:39.128]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[00:54:00.861 --> 00:54:01.921]  For the love of clean water.
[00:54:25.796 --> 00:54:30.098]  We are back on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:30.118 --> 00:54:34.660]  We've got a couple of short segments here before the long segment, but we're going to get our guest on now.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:41.624]  He is Gadsad, and I'm obviously butchering that name and will continue to do so, but that's the easiest way for me to say it.
[00:54:42.324 --> 00:54:43.905]  He's been on the show before, of course.
[00:54:43.945 --> 00:54:48.667]  He's an evolutionary behavioral scientist at Concordia University there in Canada.
[00:54:49.087 --> 00:54:53.649]  He's known for applying evolutionary psychology to marketing and consumer behavior.
[00:54:54.090 --> 00:55:00.113]  And of course, more so recently, he's been railing against political correctness in academia.
[00:55:00.993 --> 00:55:07.157]  He's at Gadsad on Twitter, and you can search for Gadsad on YouTube, find his excellent YouTube channel.
[00:55:07.817 --> 00:55:22.446]  Now, Gadsad, I don't want to trigger you here, because, of course, we've got some students now calling on professors to individually ask hundreds of students what their preferred gender pronoun is before commencing a lecture.
[00:55:23.067 --> 00:55:27.850]  So, so as not to trigger you, can you let the audience know what you're identifying as today?
[00:55:29.091 --> 00:55:36.203]  Well, so I want to be gender free and carbon free, and so I now identify as an isosceles trapezoid.
[00:55:38.786 --> 00:55:45.052]  As long as you don't identify as an attack helicopter, because that seems to really trigger social justice worries.
[00:55:45.092 --> 00:55:49.596]  Lauren Southern just had urine dumped over her head for doing that, so I'll be sure to avoid that.
[00:55:50.116 --> 00:55:51.738]  Now, we've got a few minutes in this segment.
[00:55:52.138 --> 00:55:53.780]  Just set the table for us.
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:55.421]  Give us a three minute overview.
[00:55:56.062 --> 00:56:00.226]  Where we're at in terms of the hostile, politically correct takeover.
[00:56:00.666 --> 00:56:05.187]  ...of universities in the West, and why people should be concerned about it?
[00:56:05.287 --> 00:56:07.168]  Why does it threaten their freedoms?
[00:56:07.788 --> 00:56:19.071]  Well, because there are all sorts of various movements that are infiltrating themselves within the university campus that is stifling people's confidence in expressing their ideas, right?
[00:56:19.091 --> 00:56:23.513]  I mean, a university is supposed to be a place, a safe space, where people can go and
[00:56:24.913 --> 00:56:25.773]  ...debate one another.
[00:56:26.013 --> 00:56:44.018]  And because of the thought police, because of the language police, because of political correctness, because of microaggressions and cultural appropriation and so on, everybody walks around on eggshells, terrified that they might utter a syllable that might be misconstrued in some ways, and that's not good for a free society.
[00:56:45.891 --> 00:56:54.099]  And, I mean, just to put people right, I often hear people say, oh, this is just a fringe minority, they're on Twitter, they're on Tumblr, they have no real influence.
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:57.603]  But they do, because these people are going to be our future leaders, right?
[00:56:57.643 --> 00:57:02.708]  This is the next generation that's going to set the laws and make the rules on free speech.
[00:57:02.768 --> 00:57:04.269]  That's why it affects us, correct?
[00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:05.371]  Well, exactly.
[00:57:05.971 --> 00:57:09.052]  At some point, the lunacy becomes normalized, right?
[00:57:09.072 --> 00:57:19.076]  I mean, Thomas Kuhn, the famous philosopher, talked about a paradigmatic shift, and then once a paradigm shift happens, it eventually becomes part of normal science.
[00:57:19.457 --> 00:57:21.397]  And so if we allow these lunatic
[00:57:23.138 --> 00:57:24.559]  Thank you very much.
[00:57:45.205 --> 00:57:54.532]  Now, over the last several weeks, I guess, and we can get into more detail later, we've had this tyranny, this politically correct tyranny, really come to the fore.
[00:57:54.572 --> 00:58:08.163]  We've had Milo Yiannopoulos, Ben Shapiro on these speaking tours, and almost every event they either get interrupted, in the case of Shapiro, they actually physically tried to block people from attending his lecture.
[00:58:08.823 --> 00:58:19.412]  We have these safe space students preaching tolerance and diversity all day long, while themselves exhibiting complete intolerance for diversity of opinion.
[00:58:20.093 --> 00:58:25.498]  What I don't understand is, you know, they could have a peaceful rally outside these events, express their free speech.
[00:58:25.838 --> 00:58:30.602]  Their message would be received far better, yet they're smearing themselves with blood.
[00:58:30.943 --> 00:58:32.904]  They're physically blocking events.
[00:58:33.285 --> 00:58:34.386]  They're interrupting.
[00:58:35.006 --> 00:58:42.908]  I mean, why do these social justice warriors use these violent mob intimidation tactics when it doesn't even boost their credibility to the outside world?
[00:58:42.928 --> 00:58:45.868]  We're going to get into that after the break with Gadstad.
[00:58:46.188 --> 00:58:46.809]  InfoWars.com.
[00:58:46.829 --> 00:58:47.469]  Stay tuned.
[00:58:47.549 --> 00:58:52.310]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:53.550]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:00.543 --> 00:59:04.904]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male and then when Super Female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:59:05.185 --> 00:59:09.806]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:59:09.946 --> 00:59:10.967]  Talk about the effects.
[00:59:11.287 --> 00:59:12.767]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:59:12.787 --> 00:59:14.388]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:59:14.708 --> 00:59:15.768]  I feel like I look better.
[00:59:15.828 --> 00:59:16.468]  I feel better.
[00:59:16.548 --> 00:59:17.629]  I feel sexier.
[00:59:17.949 --> 00:59:18.309]  I love it.
[00:59:18.569 --> 00:59:21.490]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:24.231]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[00:59:24.471 --> 00:59:25.512]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:59:25.552 --> 00:59:26.593]  Consult your physician.
[00:59:26.733 --> 00:59:28.955]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:59:29.115 --> 00:59:30.056]  This is life-changing.
[00:59:30.476 --> 00:59:31.237]  Shower filters.
[00:59:31.377 --> 00:59:33.018]  We're introducing the best yet.
[00:59:33.118 --> 00:59:37.041]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[00:59:37.181 --> 00:59:41.805]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[00:59:42.005 --> 00:59:48.931]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[00:59:49.091 --> 00:59:51.453]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and
[00:59:51.533 --> 00:59:52.955]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:19.983 --> 01:00:25.174]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.334 --> 01:00:25.795]  Mother...
[01:00:29.289 --> 01:00:31.430]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:34.272]  Alex will be back at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:34.692 --> 01:00:39.315]  But we're talking to Gad Saad, a behavioural scientist out of Concordia University.
[01:00:39.776 --> 01:00:47.320]  Just before we hit the break there, I was getting into social justice worries and the tactics they use to interrupt these events.
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.343]  Because we know they're completely intolerant of diversity of opinion.
[01:00:51.723 --> 01:00:53.204]  But they don't go out and picket.
[01:00:53.244 --> 01:00:54.405]  They don't wave signs.
[01:00:55.225 --> 01:01:02.474]  They pull fire alarms, they make bomb threats, they interrupt events, they smear themselves with blood and scream out.
[01:01:02.934 --> 01:01:05.818]  They physically block people from attending these events.
[01:01:06.518 --> 01:01:07.179]  Gadsad.
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:10.423]  Why do they resort to these mob intimidation tactics?
[01:01:10.683 --> 01:01:12.626]  It decreases their credibility.
[01:01:12.926 --> 01:01:15.189]  What message are they trying to send by doing this?
[01:01:16.049 --> 01:01:19.552]  I think I actually discussed this in a recent Sad Truth clip.
[01:01:19.952 --> 01:01:24.815]  I think they have a profoundly erroneous view of what freedom of speech is.
[01:01:25.215 --> 01:01:33.420]  They genuinely believe that the tactics that you're speaking of is their exercise of their freedom of speech, right?
[01:01:33.661 --> 01:01:37.463]  So they think that stopping you from speaking is a form of
[01:01:37.623 --> 01:01:38.725]  Free speech, right?
[01:01:38.765 --> 01:01:42.369]  They don't recognize that that is a violation of your right to free speech.
[01:01:42.429 --> 01:01:53.523]  So it really is a complete inability to understand that freedom of speech means you have a right to speak and they're allowed to set up an alternate venue.
[01:01:54.404 --> 01:01:57.107]  Where they offer their own dissenting voices.
[01:01:57.187 --> 01:01:58.769]  It doesn't mean that they could shut you down.
[01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:03.214]  But repeatedly, when I've engaged some of these folks, they truly believe this.
[01:02:03.275 --> 01:02:04.776]  And I'll give you another quick example.
[01:02:05.517 --> 01:02:12.866]  I've blocked people who are, you know, on the very rare cases where somebody is, you know, very hostile towards me and insulting and so on, I block them.
[01:02:13.266 --> 01:02:17.730]  They usually come back and accuse me of violating their free speech.
[01:02:18.131 --> 01:02:35.247]  So how, you know, how unaware must you be of the most basic tenets of free speech to think that you could follow me around all over Twitter, hurl insults at me on my various social portals, and if I decide to disengage with you, I am violating your freedom to insult me.
[01:02:35.407 --> 01:02:36.008]  It's grotesque.
[01:02:37.677 --> 01:02:39.238]  No, I mean, I've had that numerous times.
[01:02:39.258 --> 01:02:43.722]  They think that disagreeing with them is you violating their free speech.
[01:02:43.762 --> 01:02:46.684]  They have no understanding of debate or dissent whatsoever.
[01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:57.472]  And this new thing I've noticed quite recently is we've got these safe spaces now trying to argue that disagreeing with their opinions is a form of violence.
[01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:07.893]  We had people walking out of the Milo Yiannopoulos lecture saying they felt physically threatened because he expressed a different opinion.
[01:03:08.273 --> 01:03:18.956]  We had the case that you mentioned in your lecture in Ottawa recently, you know, Laura Kipnis, she writes an article suggesting that rape culture might be, you know, fanned by paranoia.
[01:03:19.256 --> 01:03:21.376]  She's targeted under the same justification.
[01:03:21.656 --> 01:03:27.018]  How can it possibly be argued with any credibility that having a differing opinion is a form of violence?
[01:03:27.745 --> 01:03:31.307]  Well, their position is so fraught with contradictions.
[01:03:31.327 --> 01:03:34.029]  So, for example, earlier you were discussing diversity, right?
[01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:40.073]  So they're all about racial, ethnic, cultural, religious, sexual orientation diversity.
[01:03:40.433 --> 01:03:48.299]  But the most important form of diversity at a university, which is intellectual diversity, that's an absolute no-no.
[01:03:49.019 --> 01:03:52.847]  So skin pigmentation diversity, we support that.
[01:03:53.328 --> 01:03:56.013]  Diversity of ideas, well that's just unsafe.
[01:03:56.053 --> 01:03:57.456]  We won't tolerate such nonsense.
[01:03:57.997 --> 01:03:58.698]  It's grotesque.
[01:04:00.834 --> 01:04:05.536]  Now I wanted to get into this aspect of it because I sent out a tweet just before I came on the show.
[01:04:06.336 --> 01:04:07.176]  See what you make of this.
[01:04:07.657 --> 01:04:14.980]  Social media allows arrested development adult babies who never grew up to accumulate power by throwing tantrums.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:22.022]  This explains the temptation for lazy, unsuccessful, ugly and unpopular people to become social justice warriors.
[01:04:22.502 --> 01:04:26.024]  You talked about Munchausen syndrome in your lecture.
[01:04:27.144 --> 01:04:34.409]  This process where people pretend to be afflicted to garner sympathy, now they've got the platform of social media to do it.
[01:04:34.489 --> 01:04:36.611]  They've organized like never before.
[01:04:36.631 --> 01:04:38.012]  They've accumulated this power.
[01:04:38.432 --> 01:04:46.357]  Just explain how that relates to the growth, the connection between social media and this expression of this Munchausen Syndrome.
[01:04:46.377 --> 01:04:52.701]  So as you said, Munchausen Syndrome is this psychiatric disorder where people get ego strokes.
[01:04:52.741 --> 01:04:56.324]  They get attention by feigning illness, by feigning injury.
[01:04:56.704 --> 01:05:03.907]  Well, imagine if now I could be given a massive platform where I incessantly cry victimhood.
[01:05:04.227 --> 01:05:06.908]  I'm going to get attention and it becomes orgasmic.
[01:05:07.728 --> 01:05:10.429]  We'll be back after the break to talk about that with Gadstad.
[01:05:10.449 --> 01:05:11.070]  Stay with us.
[01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:12.810]  Another example of cultural suicide.
[01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:17.232]  Germany is now banning pork sausages in schools so they don't, quote, offend Muslim migrants.
[01:05:17.512 --> 01:05:24.718]  An increasing number of public schools and child daycare centers have stopped serving pork sausages, bacon, and ham over, quote, religious considerations.
[01:05:25.038 --> 01:05:32.685]  But in backlash, members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's party are fighting to keep pork on the menu, insisting the consumption of pork is part of German culture.
[01:05:32.885 --> 01:05:43.074]  Daniel Gunther, party representative, said, quote, The protection of minorities, including for religious reasons, must not mean that the majority is overruled in their free decision by ill-conceived consideration.
[01:05:43.294 --> 01:05:48.979]  He also pointed out that tolerance also means the appreciation and sufferance of other food cultures and lifestyles.
[01:05:49.159 --> 01:05:56.845]  Huther said that those who didn't want to eat pork didn't have to, adding, quote, No one should be obliged to do so, but we also don't want the majority of heaven to refrain from pork.
[01:05:57.125 --> 01:06:00.768]  You know, it goes without saying that German sausages are part of the country's culture.
[01:06:00.909 --> 01:06:05.813]  So this ban on pork sausages at public schools to make Muslim migrants happy is simply cultural genocide.
[01:06:06.033 --> 01:06:08.395]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com

[01:07:10.149 --> 01:07:13.110]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:15.490]  Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:22.392]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[01:07:28.013 --> 01:07:37.015]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[01:07:37.435 --> 01:07:46.059]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[01:07:46.319 --> 01:07:53.242]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spike G-Rex herbal processing technique.
[01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:58.785]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs, backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best.
[01:07:58.985 --> 01:08:00.466]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:08:00.486 --> 01:08:01.027]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:27.876 --> 01:08:30.597]  It's Paul Joseph Watson live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:30.777 --> 01:08:37.240]  Alex will be live at the bottom of the hour with breaking news updates, so be sure to stay tuned for that.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:43.543]  But right now we're talking to Gad Saad, and sorry I had to cut you off before the break, we've got a long segment here so we can really get into it.
[01:08:44.043 --> 01:08:55.128]  Now I'll just raise the point of, you know, people are always asking me where this sudden obsession with, you know, oppression Olympics, grievance culture, safe space, where did it come from?
[01:08:55.808 --> 01:09:03.321]  Well, as Jon Ronson talks about in his book, So You've Been Publicly Shamed, he makes the point that, like never before,
[01:09:04.517 --> 01:09:07.338]  Organized groups of citizens have had this much power.
[01:09:07.739 --> 01:09:09.840]  They have access to this newfound power.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:17.743]  It's very alluring, because social justice warriors are, by and large, lazy, unsuccessful people.
[01:09:18.144 --> 01:09:27.628]  They've suddenly got access to this huge platform, which allows them to project themselves out onto the world, to blame the world for their own inadequacies.
[01:09:28.168 --> 01:09:33.471]  You combine that, Gadsad, with Munchausen Syndrome, and it's a toxic combination, isn't it?
[01:09:34.111 --> 01:09:35.613]  It's orgiastic, right?
[01:09:35.693 --> 01:09:38.195]  I mean, it's a wonderful venue.
[01:09:39.016 --> 01:09:41.758]  Look, I happen to be overweight, right?
[01:09:41.798 --> 01:09:48.984]  Now, I could look at this as an opportunity to lose weight when my physician says, hey, it's healthy for you to be thinner.
[01:09:49.985 --> 01:09:56.128]  Or I could take the social justice warrior approach and say, look, you're engaging in fatism, doctor.
[01:09:57.068 --> 01:10:00.069]  You're not accepting me for being differently weighted.
[01:10:00.509 --> 01:10:03.350]  And that's inappropriate because you have to love me for how I am.
[01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.611]  Right.
[01:10:03.951 --> 01:10:09.473]  So it's really a question of how comfortable you are with yourself, how secure you are with who you are.
[01:10:09.733 --> 01:10:12.774]  And that allows you to navigate the realities of life.
[01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:13.014]  Right.
[01:10:13.314 --> 01:10:14.295]  But victimhood.
[01:10:14.955 --> 01:10:21.519]  Give somebody a card, a get-out-of-jail card, for all of their failures, right?
[01:10:21.559 --> 01:10:41.071]  I mean, it's easier for me to say that Hollywood images are perpetuating images of a thin guy, ideal, and hopefully then I can argue that that's not fair, they should love me for who I am and my physician is a fattest, than to actually have to go through the hard work of losing weight, right?
[01:10:41.351 --> 01:10:46.333]  And so this is really a symptom of the more general ethos of victimology, right?
[01:10:48.305 --> 01:10:48.966]  Well, exactly.
[01:10:49.006 --> 01:10:59.855]  It's them making excuses for their bad lifestyle choices, for the fact that they are unsuccessful, that they don't work hard enough, because we do live in a meritocracy, by and large.
[01:10:59.895 --> 01:11:02.277]  It's not perfect, but that's the society that we live in.
[01:11:02.677 --> 01:11:15.909]  And rather than actually go through the process of working hard, working their way up intellectually, they'd rather just blame their problems on the rest of the world and claim that that's the reason why they are, and then build a platform off of that,
[01:11:16.269 --> 01:11:20.700]  By using social media, which again allows them to accumulate more and more power.
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.745]  I also wanted to get your take on...
[01:11:24.212 --> 01:11:30.297]  The Trump phenomenon, because this ties into political correctness of course, this is a debate that's been going back and forth.
[01:11:30.817 --> 01:11:37.102]  Do you think that support for Trump represents a genuine, you know, organic backlash against political correctness?
[01:11:37.723 --> 01:11:48.832]  Or is it simply a consequence of him filling the vacuum created by those public intellectuals that were too cowardly to stand up for true liberal principles?
[01:11:49.292 --> 01:11:50.773]  I think it's a bit of both, right?
[01:11:50.793 --> 01:11:55.676]  So, for example, if we take the issue of, you know, Muslim immigration, right?
[01:11:56.076 --> 01:12:11.126]  Somewhere between his blanket statement, ban all Muslims, and the position taken by, say, someone like Paul Stockton, the former Assistant Secretary for Homeland Defense, or Eric Holder, there are these great exchanges
[01:12:11.906 --> 01:12:11.966]  Yes.
[01:12:31.403 --> 01:12:35.745]  Seeing how the public discourse is so false, right?
[01:12:35.765 --> 01:12:37.625]  I mean, the narrative is not difficult to see.
[01:12:38.225 --> 01:12:44.908]  It's as clear as the existence of gravity, yet we have to consistently be told that, you know, don't believe your lying eyes.
[01:12:44.988 --> 01:12:53.070]  And so he, I guess, exudes or exhibits or signals a measure of authenticity, rightly or wrongly so.
[01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:55.491]  That's, I think, what the people are responding to.
[01:12:55.791 --> 01:12:57.232]  He's viewed as an outsider.
[01:12:57.972 --> 01:13:04.213]  In the political sphere, who just shoots from the hips and just says what's on his mind, and I think people are responding to that.
[01:13:06.064 --> 01:13:23.872]  And I read some quotes out earlier in the show, one from a 50-year-old leftist liberal college professor out of California, who said that he was voting for Donald Trump simply to see the look on social justice warriors' faces if Donald Trump won.
[01:13:24.212 --> 01:13:30.415]  So again, that goes back right to the liberal professor who was terrified of his own students.
[01:13:30.815 --> 01:13:32.316]  We do actually still have
[01:13:32.876 --> 01:13:40.102]  You know, classical liberals who believe in truly liberal principles but are afraid to say it in public, yeah, they'll go and vote for somebody like Trump.
[01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:46.167]  Oh, and look, I see it all the time on my private personal Facebook page, right?
[01:13:47.188 --> 01:13:53.433]  You know, the aping of the same position, especially amongst my academic friends, is simply astonishing, right?
[01:13:53.473 --> 01:13:58.758]  I mean, you'd think that... I mean, sure, they're more likely to be partisan of one
[01:13:59.318 --> 01:13:59.498]  You know,
[01:14:30.818 --> 01:14:35.420]  No, it's increasingly a bigger misnomer that those are Trump supporters.
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:42.481]  Again, I read out a quote from a 20-year-old gay Arab Muslim student who's voting for Trump for his own reasons.
[01:14:42.541 --> 01:14:46.222]  So it's more of a cross-section than, you know, they'd like us to believe.
[01:14:46.622 --> 01:14:52.904]  But getting back to, you know, professors and intellectual cowardice, you talk about this in your lecture in Ottawa.
[01:14:53.744 --> 01:15:11.574]  To what extent are public intellectuals and professors themselves responsible for the evisceration of free speech in this chilling climate when they submit to fear over political correctness when they refuse, as you give the example, to even like your status on Facebook even if they agree with it?
[01:15:12.134 --> 01:15:14.896]  Well, of course, what you just said is exactly true.
[01:15:15.216 --> 01:15:20.660]  But more generally, the fact that there isn't diversity of thought on campuses.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:30.267]  I mean, I discussed in the lecture in question a study, not done by me, but by some colleagues, where they looked at political affiliation of professors.
[01:15:30.708 --> 01:15:32.949]  And the numbers were simply astonishing, right?
[01:15:33.009 --> 01:15:37.793]  I mean, across disciplines, it was something like five to one toward the Democrats.
[01:15:38.253 --> 01:15:40.355]  But in certain fields, especially the
[01:15:41.795 --> 01:15:50.598]  I mean, that's not good, right?
[01:15:51.418 --> 01:16:02.762]  I mean, there are certain things that are scientific facts that we can all agree on, but when it comes to fiscal policy or foreign policy or affirmative action or whether the death penalty is good or not,
[01:16:04.302 --> 01:16:17.615]  It is welcome to have a diversity of positions and yet when you create a echo chamber called the university where one group of folks are almost never represented, that's not good for a free society.
[01:16:19.781 --> 01:16:28.008]  I want to move on to one of the expressions of social justice worries in terms of this idea that everything is a social construct.
[01:16:28.048 --> 01:16:31.631]  This is what's come to dominate the cultural narrative now for many years.
[01:16:31.971 --> 01:16:38.877]  Of course, a lot of it is based on French post-modernism, which you made a very funny video about a couple of days ago.
[01:16:39.377 --> 01:16:53.266]  Which is complete mumbo-jumbo, has zero meaning whatsoever, and like you, I went through the process of trying to read some of these, you know, French postmodernists, Foucault, Albert Camus, etc., thinking, am I just too dumb to get this?
[01:16:53.346 --> 01:16:54.967]  I mean, does it actually mean anything?
[01:16:55.427 --> 01:16:58.189]  No, it means absolutely nothing, it's mumbo-jumbo.
[01:16:58.809 --> 01:17:06.936]  But a lot of that, you know, gender is a social construct, there's no real meaning in anything, that arose out of the French postmodernist.
[01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:19.746]  You gave a TED Talk in which you explained that in fact gender preferences are innate and biological, which of course completely contradicts this gender is a social construct idea.
[01:17:20.066 --> 01:17:23.149]  Just walk us through that research that you outlined in the TED Talk.
[01:17:23.969 --> 01:17:24.189]  Right.
[01:17:24.249 --> 01:17:31.894]  So, you know, my main area of research is to apply evolutionary psychology and biology in general to study consumer behavior.
[01:17:32.214 --> 01:17:41.540]  And so you can't engage in that enterprise without recognizing that there are innate sex differences that define human beings.
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:50.626]  As a matter of fact, the manner in which Homo sapiens are defined is by definition a sexually dimorphic species, meaning that there are innate
[01:17:51.386 --> 01:17:53.388]  Actual differences between the sexes.
[01:17:53.428 --> 01:17:56.110]  That's how biologists define our species.
[01:17:56.470 --> 01:18:04.576]  Now, the social constructivists started off with the idea that we are born tabula rasa, with empty brains, empty slates.
[01:18:05.017 --> 01:18:09.300]  And what then makes us who we are is that we transcend our biology.
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:10.981]  It's all due to socialization.
[01:18:11.321 --> 01:18:15.305]  We learn to love tall guys from Hollywood images.
[01:18:15.405 --> 01:18:18.547]  Guys learn to love shapely women because they watch Penthouse.
[01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:20.929]  Everything is due to a social construction.
[01:18:21.269 --> 01:18:22.089]  And that's laughable.
[01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:31.292]  And so what I do in my TED talk, but more generally in all of my research, is I dismantle this idea that there is nothing that is biologically based.
[01:18:31.312 --> 01:18:42.955]  So even if you take something like toy preferences, there are unbelievably compelling evidence that demonstrate that there are innate differences between boys and girls when it comes to toy preferences.
[01:18:43.195 --> 01:18:44.375]  Would you like me to go through some of these?
[01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:45.987]  Yeah, go for it.
[01:18:46.627 --> 01:19:01.031]  So for example, if you take little children who are too young to be socialized, right, so by definition they could not have learned these preferences, they will stare at or go toward sex-specific toys, right?
[01:19:01.051 --> 01:19:02.531]  So by definition they couldn't have learned these.
[01:19:02.911 --> 01:19:06.752]  If you take other species like vervet or rhesus monkeys,
[01:19:07.978 --> 01:19:13.724]  Their infants exhibit the same sex-specific toy preferences that occurs with human infants.
[01:19:14.104 --> 01:19:29.018]  If you take a disorder known as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which is an endocrinological disorder, if a little girl suffers from it, she becomes masculinized in her behaviors and in her morphology, while a girl who suffers from that disorder will then exhibit
[01:19:30.079 --> 01:19:31.581]  Boy-like behaviors.
[01:19:31.981 --> 01:19:39.026]  You could look at Sweden, which is a country that has sought to eradicate any gender markers, right?
[01:19:39.046 --> 01:19:44.090]  They've been engaged in this huge social experiment for the past 40 years to remove gender.
[01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:50.935]  Well, if you do a study of toy preferences there, the exact same sex-specific toy preferences occur.
[01:19:51.216 --> 01:19:59.462]  So there's an endless number of studies spanning very, very different disciplines that show that there are innate differences between the sexes.
[01:19:59.562 --> 01:20:09.794]  Now the reason why feminists and others don't like this idea is because they wrongly think that to argue that there are sex differences means that the sexist status quo will continue.
[01:20:10.515 --> 01:20:12.116]  And we'll be back with Gant's sad remarks.
[01:20:12.136 --> 01:20:17.963]  This man has received national attention for accurately predicting every major financial trend, including the market crash of 2008.

[01:22:11.266 --> 01:22:12.586]  Hi, my name is Nick Lupo.
[01:22:12.866 --> 01:22:15.947]  One World Way has been by far the best protein that I've ever had.
[01:22:16.127 --> 01:22:17.428]  I take it three times a day.
[01:22:17.748 --> 01:22:23.109]  Once in the morning as soon as I wake, once for a pre-workout snack, and once for a post-workout recovery drink.
[01:22:23.129 --> 01:22:26.550]  It has helped me transform and sculpt my body into what I have now.
[01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:31.812]  I began taking the product about two years ago, and boy, let me tell you, I'm in the best shape of my life.
[01:22:31.952 --> 01:22:35.493]  I've seen major muscle mass gains and have 0% body fat.
[01:22:35.653 --> 01:22:39.854]  I have had people in my gym ask if I compete in bodybuilding because of how lean and muscular I am.
[01:22:40.114 --> 01:22:46.356]  I used to suffer from everyday aches and pains from hard manual labor my whole life, and arthritis that runs through my family.
[01:22:46.576 --> 01:22:50.397]  But One World Way has helped me take that everyday pain from a 10 to a 3.
[01:22:50.857 --> 01:22:53.698]  Some days I feel no pain at all, just full of life and energy.
[01:22:53.718 --> 01:22:56.579]  It has also helped my skin look younger and healthier.

[01:24:28.696 --> 01:24:41.201]  You're back on the Alex Jones Show live with Gadsad and just before we hit the break there we were talking about this idea of gender as a social construct which of course is completely demolished by the actual science.
[01:24:41.482 --> 01:24:43.202]  We had this article out of the Daily Mail.
[01:24:43.743 --> 01:24:45.063]  Sorry mom, I'm straight.
[01:24:45.443 --> 01:24:55.928]  Oversharing mother who blogs about her pride in her rainbow boy reveals how her son finally plucked up the courage to come out to her as heterosexual.
[01:24:56.568 --> 01:25:04.772]  So now we've got parents believing in this post-modernist idea that everything is relative, that everything is a social construct.
[01:25:05.332 --> 01:25:18.118]  And, gad sad, if they really take that on board, given that it's completely unscientific and antagonistic towards basic biological truths, that's really going to cause some problems with these children growing up, isn't it?
[01:25:18.638 --> 01:25:19.479]  Well, absolutely.
[01:25:19.559 --> 01:25:27.527]  And I mean, look, as a scientist, all I care about, all I'm committed to is the honest pursuit of the truth, right?
[01:25:27.587 --> 01:25:34.573]  We all try our best to get as close to the truth as we can via the various scientific enterprises that we engage in.
[01:25:35.234 --> 01:25:48.502]  And what upsets me is when you have the social sciences and the humanities building theoretical and so-called empirical edifices over the past hundred years that are really built on absolute nonsense.
[01:25:48.542 --> 01:25:51.224]  So just to move from sex differences to another
[01:25:51.624 --> 01:25:52.344]  type of difference.
[01:25:52.744 --> 01:26:07.527]  The idea, for example, of cultural relativism, right, that all cultures are unique and distinct and equal, started with Franz Boas, a cultural anthropologist, who recognized that sometimes biology could be misused for nefarious reasons.
[01:26:07.927 --> 01:26:15.248]  And therefore, let's create a new worldview, a bullshit worldview, but nonetheless a worldview where biology ceases to matter.
[01:26:15.508 --> 01:26:20.929]  There are no such things in his view, things as human nature or human universals.
[01:26:21.349 --> 01:26:24.610]  Everything is constrained by the unique culture that you come in.
[01:26:24.850 --> 01:26:34.694]  Now that is such a laughably false position that you genuinely wonder how otherwise intelligent, sophisticated academics could espouse such things.
[01:26:35.034 --> 01:26:41.696]  Well, they espouse them because their ideology trumps the pursuit of truth.
[01:26:42.156 --> 01:26:47.618]  And that's why we should never allow ideology to infiltrate the scientific enterprise.
[01:26:49.008 --> 01:26:54.571]  And it causes real damage, this idea that all cultures are equal and should all be tolerated equally.
[01:26:54.871 --> 01:27:03.495]  I mean, in India, every year UNICEF has to do a massive public relations campaign where they say, please don't crap in the street.
[01:27:03.715 --> 01:27:06.557]  It's causing horrible diseases in children.
[01:27:07.858 --> 01:27:12.702]  600 million people in India still crap on the street because it's part of their culture.
[01:27:12.722 --> 01:27:21.930]  If you say, well that's a bad culture, it needs to be changed, they need to be educated out of that kind of behaviour because it's dangerous, then, you know, you're racist.
[01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:23.872]  So that's a concrete example of how...
[01:27:24.292 --> 01:27:26.875]  Not all cultures are equal, correct?
[01:27:27.496 --> 01:27:28.016]  Exactly.
[01:27:28.116 --> 01:27:45.115]  And it's precisely this ideological bent that is, if you like, placing handcuffs on people when trying to discuss things like, you know, immigration from countries that might otherwise not share the values
[01:27:45.916 --> 01:27:47.957]  Of our Western liberal traditions, right?
[01:27:48.198 --> 01:27:59.625]  I mean, it doesn't make you a racist to say that if you come from a particular region of the world, you're likely to be less tolerant of Jews, or of gays, or of women, or of animals, or of non-believers.
[01:27:59.965 --> 01:28:04.228]  That is an absolute fact that is as clear as the existence of gravity.
[01:28:04.488 --> 01:28:09.911]  Now, does that mean that every single person who comes from those lands is likely to exhibit that type of intolerance?
[01:28:10.031 --> 01:28:10.652]  Of course not!
[01:28:11.252 --> 01:28:18.077]  But on the aggregate, does it mean that if you are from Sweden, you're more likely to be tolerant of homosexuality than if you're from Yemen?
[01:28:18.478 --> 01:28:19.378]  Absolutely yes.
[01:28:19.738 --> 01:28:28.985]  And we have to be able to feel sufficiently self-confident to otherwise enunciate these banally trivial realities, right?
[01:28:29.025 --> 01:28:35.010]  But most people are afraid to do so, lest they might be accused of being a racist, a bigot, an Islamophobe, and so on.
[01:28:36.371 --> 01:28:44.660]  And that's the thing, I mean, the West is the most tolerant place in the world, and yet we're constantly castigated as being the most racist.
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:56.091]  If you go to some of these areas in the Middle East and try to, you know, try to be homosexual, try to live your own independent alternative lifestyle, in many cases they will behead you, but blame is always placed on the West.
[01:28:57.873 --> 01:29:03.296]  Gadsad, just give our final comments and tell people where they can find your Twitter and YouTube channel.
[01:29:03.576 --> 01:29:09.638]  So add Gadsad and you could find my YouTube channel by just entering my name Gadsad.
[01:29:10.059 --> 01:29:12.620]  I have a series of clips called The Sad Truth.
[01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:15.481]  I hope you'll subscribe and enjoy The Reason.
[01:29:17.502 --> 01:29:19.463]  Okay Gadsad, thanks for joining us.
[01:29:19.963 --> 01:29:21.184]  Cheers, thank you so much for having me again.
[01:29:22.358 --> 01:29:23.659]  Okay, there goes Gadstad again.
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.861]  Check out his videos on YouTube.
[01:29:26.022 --> 01:29:28.024]  Really enlightening, interesting stuff.
[01:29:28.424 --> 01:29:31.667]  Presented in a way that you can grasp, that you can fully understand.
[01:29:32.228 --> 01:29:33.749]  Not like French post-modernism.
[01:29:34.450 --> 01:29:37.393]  And you can really use these videos to reach out to other people.
[01:29:37.413 --> 01:29:39.575]  We're going to talk to Lauren Southern in the third hour.
[01:29:39.915 --> 01:29:44.899]  She was actually attacked by tolerant liberal social justice warriors for having a different opinion.
[01:29:45.339 --> 01:29:49.242]  But coming up next is Alex Jones with a live news update.
[01:29:49.722 --> 01:29:51.604]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[01:29:51.964 --> 01:29:54.466]  Breaking news at infowars.com.
[01:29:54.486 --> 01:29:55.307]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:55.347 --> 01:29:56.848]  Stay tuned.
[01:29:59.810 --> 01:30:00.711]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.211 --> 01:30:02.812]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.753 --> 01:30:06.435]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:12.991]  And yet another example of cultural suicide.
[01:30:13.152 --> 01:30:17.415]  Germany is now banning pork sausages in schools so they don't, quote, offend Muslim migrants.
[01:30:17.675 --> 01:30:24.880]  An increasing number of public schools and child daycare centers have stopped serving pork sausages, bacon, and ham over, quote, religious considerations.
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:32.866]  But in backlash, members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's party are fighting to keep pork on the menu, insisting the consumption of pork is part of German culture.
[01:30:33.066 --> 01:30:38.270]  Daniel Gunther, party representative, said, quote, the protection of minorities, including for religious reasons,
[01:30:38.490 --> 01:30:41.934]  No one should be obliged to do so, but we also don't want the majority having to refrain from pork.
[01:30:57.290 --> 01:31:00.937]  You know, it goes without saying that German sausages are part of the country's culture.
[01:31:01.077 --> 01:31:05.986]  So this ban on pork sausages at public schools to make Muslim migrants happy is simply cultural genocide.
[01:31:06.066 --> 01:31:08.571]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com.
[01:31:10.563 --> 01:31:13.785]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[01:31:14.065 --> 01:31:19.348]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[01:31:19.668 --> 01:31:27.592]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[01:31:28.033 --> 01:31:33.676]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[01:31:34.156 --> 01:31:42.821]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[01:31:43.261 --> 01:31:49.124]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[01:31:49.464 --> 01:31:55.808]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:31:56.228 --> 01:32:01.271]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[01:32:01.591 --> 01:32:03.755]  Now available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:04.055 --> 01:32:06.119]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:10.253 --> 01:32:10.713]  Hey, everyone!
[01:32:11.073 --> 01:32:16.935]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:32:17.195 --> 01:32:18.795]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:32:19.275 --> 01:32:29.197]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:32:29.558 --> 01:32:35.539]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:32:35.979 --> 01:32:36.340]  We're good to go!
[01:32:50.896 --> 01:32:51.377]  I think so.
[01:33:24.181 --> 01:33:24.922]  Big Brother.
[01:33:25.303 --> 01:33:26.564]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:27.125 --> 01:33:28.126]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:29.028 --> 01:33:30.449]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:30.730 --> 01:33:31.891]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:32.372 --> 01:33:36.898]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:41.465 --> 01:33:43.566]  You're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:43.626 --> 01:33:46.028]  Alex will be coming up soon with a live report.
[01:33:46.048 --> 01:33:49.250]  We've also got a special report, which we're going to throw to you soon.
[01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:50.690]  We're going to hit more news for the moment.
[01:33:50.710 --> 01:33:52.491]  This is out of the Express.
[01:33:53.112 --> 01:33:58.135]  Cultural differences led to migrants sexually assaulting child at UK train station.
[01:33:58.939 --> 01:34:02.443]  Now remember the report we had back from a couple of weeks ago.
[01:34:03.103 --> 01:34:09.750]  We had a case in Austria where a migrant sexually abused a boy at a swimming pool, who was also a migrant by the way.
[01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:12.192]  He had Serbian parents I believe.
[01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:18.102]  And the thing about it was this migrant wasn't even worried about getting caught by the police.
[01:34:18.162 --> 01:34:23.845]  The behaviour was so normal, so routine to him, that he thought he could just get away with it.
[01:34:24.205 --> 01:34:31.408]  He abused, sexually abused this young boy in the locker room, went back to the swimming pool and started diving off the board.
[01:34:31.728 --> 01:34:41.232]  They actually arrested him when he was still in the swimming pool because he thought it was just completely routine to molest young boys because that's part of his culture, right?
[01:34:41.792 --> 01:34:46.578]  And every culture's equal, and you can't judge anyone, even if they're paedophiles.
[01:34:46.998 --> 01:34:48.880]  So now we've got this out of the express.
[01:34:49.561 --> 01:34:58.851]  A Somalian migrant brought through the courts for molesting a child at a train station doesn't think he did anything wrong due to cultural difference, as the court heard.
[01:34:59.582 --> 01:35:08.889]  Al Abduhali, 34, tried to kiss a 15-year-old girl on a station platform, lunged at a female passenger on a train journey, and made an approach at another woman.
[01:35:09.489 --> 01:35:19.016]  But despite pleading guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the security guard, who came to Britain in 2011, still has trouble admitting he did anything wrong.
[01:35:19.456 --> 01:35:26.121]  He told police he came from a conservative culture, and doesn't grasp the sexual boundary between men and women in the UK.
[01:35:27.475 --> 01:35:37.604]  And yet still we're being told that like Germany we have to import hundreds of thousands if not millions of these people with no actual solid plan to integrate them whatsoever.
[01:35:38.522 --> 01:35:44.586]  In countries like Denmark, they've had sexual consent lessons which haven't worked out so well.
[01:35:45.246 --> 01:35:53.291]  We still see reports constantly, almost every day, in fact sometimes multiple times a day, of these rapes taking place.
[01:35:53.832 --> 01:36:05.359]  Of course, in many cases, the media itself in Germany and Sweden is complicit in covering up these crimes because they don't want to legitimize critics of mass migration.
[01:36:05.959 --> 01:36:09.080]  But we've got our special report ready now, I believe.
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:12.661]  This is the Bernie baby, who unfortunately died recently.
[01:36:12.681 --> 01:36:14.462]  Here's that special report.
[01:36:14.482 --> 01:36:15.002]  Take it away.
[01:36:16.983 --> 01:36:33.509]  Imagine if you had a chance to plead with a man or woman who was standing at the edge of the top floor balcony of the Empire States Building
[01:36:35.356 --> 01:36:45.281]  About to throw themselves down to a certain death, holding that baby in their arms.
[01:36:47.302 --> 01:36:48.363]  What would run through your mind?
[01:36:50.644 --> 01:36:53.446]  What would go through your heart and your gut?
[01:36:55.467 --> 01:36:59.349]  You tell them to value their life, but also the life of the child.
[01:37:00.389 --> 01:37:03.411]  You tell them that no matter how bad the despair they were having,
[01:37:04.574 --> 01:37:08.757]  It shouldn't be transferred to that little baby.
[01:37:10.879 --> 01:37:23.588]  We've seen the phenomenon many times where people that aren't sociopathic, aren't psychopathic, but are mentally ill, lose their job, don't feel like they have a future, and they kill themselves, but first kill their children.
[01:37:27.431 --> 01:37:33.616]  Now I'm going to cover, out of the thousands of subjects that are very serious that we talk about, what is undoubtedly
[01:37:35.063 --> 01:37:42.749]  The most important medical issue facing humanity today of many.
[01:37:44.050 --> 01:37:58.521]  And it's a life and death situation where you not only have your own life in your hands, but you have the life of that newborn baby or that 18 month old toddler or that five year old daughter in your hands.
[01:37:59.982 --> 01:38:04.486]  And you are being moved towards the edge of that precipice.
[01:38:05.805 --> 01:38:06.586]  And certain death.
[01:38:07.166 --> 01:38:14.793]  Now listen to me very carefully, because I'm gonna make this short and sweet, and I'm gonna give people some life-saving homework.
[01:38:15.774 --> 01:38:22.020]  A baby, made famous in Las Vegas for his uncanny resemblance to presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, has died.
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:30.388]  Oliver became a social media sensation, but just a week after his appearance in Las Vegas, he died of sudden infant death syndrome.
[01:38:31.587 --> 01:38:51.702]  A few days ago it was announced that the cute little Bernie baby at four months of age died of sudden infant death syndrome that didn't show up anywhere in the world until the 60s and 70s and only showed up in industrialized countries.
[01:38:51.742 --> 01:38:54.344]  And they have governmental studies on this in Australia.
[01:38:54.725 --> 01:38:56.306]  There are studies on it here in the United States.
[01:38:56.326 --> 01:39:00.049]  I'm going to put some of those up on screen where the phenomenon
[01:39:01.152 --> 01:39:11.215]  Of infants dying in their crib, it has been directly linked all over the world to the day or the day after they get vaccines.
[01:39:12.056 --> 01:39:23.339]  You can read the inserts of any vaccine and it will tell you that it's been linked to death and to neurological disorders, to paralysis, to narcolepsy, epilepsy, the list goes on and on.
[01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:27.281]  That it's been linked to causing type 1 diabetes that they claim is genetic.
[01:39:28.191 --> 01:39:32.673]  But the vaccine triggers it and burns out your pancreas when it causes pancreatitis.
[01:39:32.713 --> 01:39:33.653]  This is all on record.
[01:39:34.394 --> 01:39:44.478]  But they get up on the news and they tell you there's never been any problems with vaccines, though they established a multi-billion dollar fund in the early 80s to cover all this up in secret courts.
[01:39:45.278 --> 01:39:46.398]  Why is it secret?
[01:39:47.439 --> 01:39:48.319]  Because they know.
[01:39:48.339 --> 01:39:57.043]  In ABC News it turned out, back in 2000 reported on secret CDC meetings, where their own directors said, I wouldn't give this to my children or grandchildren.
[01:39:59.366 --> 01:40:03.589]  Rob Dew, InfoWars News Director, sent out a tweet over the weekend and he made the right point.
[01:40:03.629 --> 01:40:06.151]  He said this needs to be investigated basically for vaccines.
[01:40:08.012 --> 01:40:11.415]  And notice the term they use, sudden infant death syndrome.
[01:40:12.035 --> 01:40:14.457]  It's like spontaneous combustion.
[01:40:14.537 --> 01:40:16.959]  Nobody knows why it happens, what it's caused by.
[01:40:19.650 --> 01:40:20.971]  Well, we do know what's causing it.
[01:40:21.592 --> 01:40:23.894]  It's an autoimmune response and a swelling of the brain.
[01:40:24.534 --> 01:40:26.596]  That's why many times they don't call it SIDS.
[01:40:26.856 --> 01:40:33.983]  They will indict the parents because they'll do an autopsy and there'll be blood on the brain as if they were beaten or violently shaken.
[01:40:35.848 --> 01:40:37.089]  But they've stopped doing that.
[01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:39.371]  They've stopped arresting parents because it kept coming out in court.
[01:40:39.712 --> 01:40:42.354]  It was even happening to kids at the hospital.
[01:40:42.394 --> 01:40:48.660]  Sometimes they would collapse there, and the baby would have a convulsion minutes after, so they'd keep them in the hospital.
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:50.321]  They'd check the surveillance tapes.
[01:40:50.381 --> 01:40:51.342]  Nobody had beaten the baby.
[01:40:52.623 --> 01:40:54.365]  So listen to me very, very carefully.
[01:40:57.136 --> 01:41:02.601]  I'm not saying the technology of learned immunity through vaccines doesn't exist, it isn't 500 years old.
[01:41:03.081 --> 01:41:04.302]  The media always misrepresents that.
[01:41:04.683 --> 01:41:15.012]  What I'm saying is, when you start giving babies 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 vaccines, like they're doing now in some cases with hypochondriac parents, get them upwards of 60 by age 2.
[01:41:17.549 --> 01:41:31.938]  It's known in animal husbandry, I've worked for many years for a large animal and small animal vet throughout high school, that sometimes cows or horses would drop dead after you gave them a vaccine or have a convulsion an hour later and then be mentally retarded after it happened or die.
[01:41:34.005 --> 01:41:40.470]  Gave that cow the shots and she fell over for two days, got backed up and now just stands there, doesn't even eat.
[01:41:41.051 --> 01:41:42.872]  Sending her to get slaughtered tomorrow.
[01:41:43.553 --> 01:41:49.478]  I've sat there many times when they're loading the cows in that are brain damaged and got drool coming out their nostrils.
[01:41:50.239 --> 01:41:52.541]  And they look just like the kids that have got autism.
[01:41:53.582 --> 01:42:00.948]  Now, I'm going to show you just a few mainstream news articles along this line where they're having trouble covering all this up.
[01:42:02.315 --> 01:42:08.378]  Here's one from NCBI, emergent human pathogen simian virus 40 and its role in cancer.
[01:42:08.459 --> 01:42:10.220]  And then it goes into its introduction.
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:18.704]  And this is the big Baylor research paper with the microbiology, virology department in Texas.
[01:42:19.225 --> 01:42:25.288]  And there's just literally thousands of universities saying the same thing, growing brain tumors, lung cancers, the list goes on and on.
[01:42:26.069 --> 01:42:27.830]  You wonder why bone cancers
[01:42:29.315 --> 01:42:30.155]  And all this are exploding.
[01:42:31.075 --> 01:42:40.778]  It is directly linked to this and other government documents estimate that just the first round of the polio vaccines exposed 98 million people to it, many of which ended up dying.
[01:42:42.038 --> 01:42:49.640]  Now, they knew that most cancer was viral in 1905, 1910, some papers even previous to that.
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:51.021]  It's incredible.
[01:42:51.041 --> 01:42:52.481]  I'm gonna get back to that here in just a moment.
[01:42:53.661 --> 01:43:01.364]  Again, just type in village dies after vaccines or doctors discover sterilant in UN-administered tetanus shot.
[01:43:01.704 --> 01:43:02.544]  I mean, it's all there.
[01:43:02.665 --> 01:43:03.685]  Thousands of examples.
[01:43:04.105 --> 01:43:06.266]  Remember all the Tuskegee experiments with the syphilis.
[01:43:06.286 --> 01:43:08.447]  I always use that example because people know about that one.
[01:43:08.467 --> 01:43:14.509]  There's thousands of radiating foster children injecting all the Native Americans in a tribe and they all get sterilized.
[01:43:14.549 --> 01:43:16.390]  I mean, it's been declassified.
[01:43:16.710 --> 01:43:19.251]  Why would you trust the bureaucrats and the eugenicists?
[01:43:19.631 --> 01:43:22.953]  And the 36,000 Nazis that were brought in after World War II to the U.S.
[01:43:22.973 --> 01:43:27.236]  to basically run things in research and development from NASA to bioweapons.
[01:43:28.977 --> 01:43:33.040]  In there, then Trojan horsing this into the vaccines.
[01:43:34.461 --> 01:43:36.662]  Here's one that actually got some coverage a few years ago.
[01:43:36.982 --> 01:43:39.664]  Homeless people die after bird flu vaccine trial in Poland.
[01:43:40.184 --> 01:43:41.365]  Now, why is this so important?
[01:43:41.525 --> 01:43:42.306]  I'm going to go over it right now.
[01:43:44.107 --> 01:43:45.308]  Listen to this very, very carefully.
[01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:49.602]  Homeless people die after bird flu vaccine trial in Poland.
[01:43:49.622 --> 01:43:51.483]  Now listen to how they talk about this so calmly.
[01:43:53.544 --> 01:44:00.267]  Medical trials on 350 homeless and poor people last year in the Polish city.
[01:44:01.808 --> 01:44:13.934]  Authorities claim that the alleged victims were paid one to two pounds, or about four dollars, two and a half to four dollars, with what they thought was a conventional flu vaccine, but according to investigators was actually an anti-bird flu drug.
[01:44:15.223 --> 01:44:20.830]  At least 21 people died in the trial of the 350, well above the average of about 8.
[01:44:22.371 --> 01:44:30.841]  So they tell you it's a regular flu shot that has its own issues, they give it to you and they go, oh, normally it only kills 8 people, but it killed 21.
[01:44:31.642 --> 01:44:32.563]  That is Russian roulette.
[01:44:32.783 --> 01:44:35.005]  They didn't even tell you, this is going to kill 8 of you.
[01:44:36.817 --> 01:44:39.018]  But you're homeless, see, it's eugenics.
[01:44:39.618 --> 01:44:43.179]  Love the homeless, pay taxes for the homeless, you know, be poor because of the homeless.
[01:44:43.219 --> 01:44:44.819]  All that fake liberal garbage is the cover.
[01:44:45.139 --> 01:44:49.521]  It's like all their fake anti-racism stuff is the cover, because they're the real anti-humans, period.
[01:44:51.341 --> 01:44:53.922]  And they just calmly reported it to this newspaper and a bunch of others.
[01:44:53.942 --> 01:44:55.522]  Well, it normally only kills eight people.
[01:44:55.542 --> 01:44:57.223]  We take them in, we don't tell them it's experimental.
[01:44:57.543 --> 01:44:58.703]  Yeah, it kills eight.
[01:44:58.823 --> 01:45:00.584]  I'm sorry it killed more than double that.
[01:45:01.570 --> 01:45:03.111]  What if they didn't know it was going to kill one?
[01:45:03.831 --> 01:45:05.132]  And it's in all the literature.
[01:45:06.133 --> 01:45:08.214]  Everyone I know has almost been killed by a vaccine.
[01:45:08.434 --> 01:45:09.575]  My mother was a triathlete.
[01:45:10.255 --> 01:45:12.377]  Was winning, like, gold and silver medals at the state level.
[01:45:12.577 --> 01:45:14.658]  She's on UT's swim team, Masters.
[01:45:14.878 --> 01:45:16.919]  She didn't start swimming competitively until she was 30-something.
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:21.842]  By the time she was 50, she was beating people that had been top gold medal Olympic athletes.
[01:45:22.863 --> 01:45:23.123]  Okay?
[01:45:24.404 --> 01:45:25.765]  They told the team, take a flu shot.
[01:45:26.585 --> 01:45:29.367]  She took a flu shot, was in bed for almost two months, and almost died.
[01:45:30.518 --> 01:45:31.358]  Never competed again.
[01:45:31.418 --> 01:45:33.039]  She still exercises, but it took it out of her.
[01:45:34.779 --> 01:45:35.959]  It took that spark out of her.
[01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:37.620]  Soft kill weapon.
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:44.441]  My dad's brother took a tetanus shot, was in the hospital for a week, swole up all over his body like something in a science fiction movie.
[01:45:44.661 --> 01:45:47.442]  Almost died, and the doctor said, no, it was the tetanus shot.
[01:45:49.623 --> 01:45:50.983]  And I just go on and on and on.
[01:45:51.463 --> 01:45:54.944]  My personal trainer knows two good friends that in the army
[01:45:56.274 --> 01:46:01.778]  Got paralyzed with anthrax shots and one of them can barely walk a decade later.
[01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:09.483]  All of you know people around you that's happened to, but they just run this lie that everything's fine, nobody cares, go back to sleep.
[01:46:10.364 --> 01:46:12.185]  Now, I want to show you one more article and then I'm done.
[01:46:13.646 --> 01:46:14.487]  But it's up to you.
[01:46:14.507 --> 01:46:15.748]  I mean, don't you feel a responsibility?
[01:46:15.808 --> 01:46:17.669]  I know I do, to warn people about this.
[01:46:19.170 --> 01:46:20.972]  This is the New York Times, covered this a few weeks ago.
[01:46:20.992 --> 01:46:22.113]  I made a big deal about it on air.
[01:46:22.573 --> 01:46:25.315]  But if you actually read the article, it's even worse than when I got into it.
[01:46:27.193 --> 01:46:29.575]  Scientists ponder the prospect of contagious cancer.
[01:46:30.376 --> 01:46:34.960]  And they say, cancer has suddenly mutated and knows how to be communicable now.
[01:46:36.481 --> 01:46:42.186]  And suddenly, if we don't pay global warming carbon taxes, weaponized cancer is going to be out there and going to kill everybody.
[01:46:42.666 --> 01:46:44.507]  And you're going to catch it from a sneeze or anything.
[01:46:44.788 --> 01:46:53.295]  Right now, it's just nurses and people notice that if they prick themselves with a needle from someone that has colon cancer, they get the same cancer in their thumb.
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:58.263]  Again, by 1905, 1910, you name it.
[01:46:58.283 --> 01:46:59.364]  Go look at the studies.
[01:46:59.784 --> 01:47:04.549]  They were inducing cancer in rats by injecting cancerous cells or cancer viruses in.
[01:47:05.530 --> 01:47:07.311]  This is how dumb they think you are.
[01:47:07.351 --> 01:47:08.693]  They don't tell you about it until now.
[01:47:08.713 --> 01:47:09.894]  They're going to say, guess what?
[01:47:09.914 --> 01:47:11.055]  You're not going to catch a cold now.
[01:47:11.075 --> 01:47:11.996]  You're going to catch cancer.
[01:47:12.776 --> 01:47:20.063]  And it's because you were a bad human and bad to the earth when they've been weaponizing it forever and been caught adding it to vaccines since the 50s.
[01:47:21.465 --> 01:47:28.709]  And of course they were doing it before that, but they went operational against the American people in the 50s, and my grandmother at 90 years old is a casualty of it.
[01:47:29.729 --> 01:47:35.112]  She was given both strains, and one week after she got the second strain, she got that strain of polio.
[01:47:35.852 --> 01:47:39.434]  It ate more than half the nerves in her body, and she's been on crutches since then.
[01:47:39.814 --> 01:47:41.535]  My mother was four, my uncle was nine.
[01:47:44.937 --> 01:47:46.098]  She's got breast cancer today.
[01:47:47.093 --> 01:47:53.517]  They can say that's old age, but they admitted that the SV40 was in the vaccine she got, but it's worse than that.
[01:47:53.877 --> 01:47:55.798]  She got polio from the vaccine.
[01:47:56.078 --> 01:47:57.119]  Think about these gifts!
[01:47:57.199 --> 01:48:00.701]  Cancer viruses you gave her, and you gave her polio!
[01:48:01.462 --> 01:48:02.122]  Thank you!
[01:48:02.262 --> 01:48:02.562]  See it?
[01:48:03.323 --> 01:48:06.885]  It touches so many people, and it touches you, and they just want you to sit there.
[01:48:06.945 --> 01:48:10.087]  It's not dramatic like somebody jumping off the Empire State Building and they die right there.
[01:48:10.387 --> 01:48:10.647]  No, no.
[01:48:10.807 --> 01:48:14.950]  People are jumping off all around just believing these lies and killing their kids and maiming their kids.
[01:48:17.267 --> 01:48:17.807]  It's eugenics.
[01:48:17.947 --> 01:48:19.167]  It's depopulation program.
[01:48:20.308 --> 01:48:22.608]  That's why this is the biggest subject that we could possibly cover.
[01:48:23.548 --> 01:48:24.309]  It's the reality.
[01:48:25.249 --> 01:48:32.090]  And so you think about that and you think about what's going on long and hard before they tell you safe and effective, just take the shot at the clinic or the school.
[01:48:32.690 --> 01:48:36.951]  And now they're coming saying that they want to forcibly inoculate all of the world.
[01:48:37.531 --> 01:48:40.232]  And that is a line in the sand because they're coming with a weapon.
[01:48:41.892 --> 01:48:43.534]  I could have put the headline on a YouTube video.
[01:48:43.554 --> 01:48:44.215]  Maybe I should.
[01:48:44.235 --> 01:48:46.998]  21 homeless shot.
[01:48:47.459 --> 01:48:48.540]  It'd go viral everywhere.
[01:48:48.721 --> 01:48:50.923]  They'd call to ban the guns before they even read the article.
[01:48:51.324 --> 01:48:51.584]  No, no.
[01:48:52.786 --> 01:48:54.107]  Shot with a vaccine and they died.
[01:48:55.031 --> 01:48:56.012]  And the doctors admit it killed him.
[01:48:56.032 --> 01:48:59.073]  But then it's like, oh, that was, oh, it killed 21.
[01:48:59.133 --> 01:48:59.974]  That's more than double.
[01:48:59.994 --> 01:49:01.114]  It usually just kills eight.
[01:49:01.334 --> 01:49:11.219]  Think about how they hide that in plain view and hope that you don't just type in man dies of a vaccine, woman paralyzed for vaccine every day in the U.S.
[01:49:11.239 --> 01:49:11.840]  and around the world.
[01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:17.843]  I mean, they'll they'll give a cheerleader squad of 12 people in a Kansas town
[01:49:19.542 --> 01:49:24.185]  And two of them died, and a couple others got paralyzed with a Gardasil shot.
[01:49:24.786 --> 01:49:30.090]  Because they got lots that they mail out to the different clinics to track which strain does what.
[01:49:32.391 --> 01:49:42.639]  Look up in the subway in 1968, they released bio-weapons, bacteria, and they would track at the hospitals what strain did what and who got sick.
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:45.801]  I mean, that's just another well-known example.
[01:49:45.861 --> 01:49:47.683]  You are guinea pigs, you are being assaulted,
[01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:52.732]  This is what is absolutely central to the globalist plan.
[01:49:53.292 --> 01:49:55.493]  All right, back to the live transmission.
[01:49:56.354 --> 01:49:57.915]  This is the front line of the info war.
[01:49:58.075 --> 01:50:05.781]  We need humanity to rise up and educate themselves and others about what's happening and withdraw our consent from the totalitarian oppressive system.
[01:50:05.841 --> 01:50:08.343]  And for God's sakes, do your research if you're pregnant.
[01:50:08.803 --> 01:50:10.104]  Do your research if you have kids.
[01:50:10.744 --> 01:50:16.889]  If your kids took the shots and they didn't get real sick, it means they got a clean lot or from a vaccine maker that isn't part of this crew.
[01:50:17.964 --> 01:50:25.508]  And finally, we'll put up articles here about, in Germany and China and other places, the elite and the military, quote, get clean vaccines.
[01:50:26.709 --> 01:50:32.492]  And I've actually talked to billionaires and folks and they go, oh no, we go to special clinics and they basically admit to us, these are the real vaccines.
[01:50:33.212 --> 01:50:36.734]  And there's still risk with those, messing with your autoimmune system, but it works.
[01:50:37.454 --> 01:50:40.576]  We're not given the good stuff.
[01:50:41.533 --> 01:50:42.213]  You understand that?
[01:50:42.413 --> 01:50:44.114]  This is the ultimate form of discrimination.
[01:50:44.595 --> 01:50:45.635]  There's so many other points.
[01:50:45.735 --> 01:50:48.557]  For heaven's sakes, please warn yourself.
[01:50:48.617 --> 01:50:49.077]  Warn others.

[01:54:13.968 --> 01:54:15.710]  On a long and lonesome highway
[01:54:27.674 --> 01:54:32.517]  You're back on the Alex Jones Show live and the Drudge Report has just put up this headline.
[01:54:33.157 --> 01:54:37.240]  Cleveland seeking to buy riot gear for Republican National Convention.
[01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:51.729]  Cleveland is seeking to buy 2,000 sets of riot gear including riot control suits and collapsible batons as part of the city's latest move to spend a 50 million dollar federal security grant for July's Republican National Convention.
[01:54:52.609 --> 01:54:54.290]  So that looks like it's hotting up there.
[01:54:54.310 --> 01:55:03.693]  They want to buy 310 sets of riot-controlled gear, long-sleeved jackets, gloves and shingars that would be suitable for police riding bicycles.
[01:55:03.713 --> 01:55:05.474]  So you can see that over at the Drudge Report.
[01:55:06.314 --> 01:55:14.077]  Also got this story again, speaking of cultural enrichment with this migrant crisis, this migrant influx that's flooding into Europe.
[01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:16.951]  Germany bans sausages!
[01:55:17.372 --> 01:55:21.395]  Pork banned in cafes and schools to not offend refugees.
[01:55:21.895 --> 01:55:30.963]  An increasing number of public canteens, child daycare centres and schools have stopped serving sausages, bacon and ham over religious considerations.
[01:55:31.543 --> 01:55:39.850]  Now members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party are fighting to eat pork on the menu, insisting the consumption of pork is part of the German culture.
[01:55:41.243 --> 01:55:46.266]  So basically they're saying that this may offend the wave of economic migrants.
[01:55:46.786 --> 01:55:52.989]  Mr. Gunther argued that tolerance also means the appreciation and sufferance of other food cultures and lifestyles.
[01:55:53.790 --> 01:56:04.676]  Remember we had the video clip back a couple of months ago of the Muslim students in the German school saying they find Germans disgusting because they eat pork.
[01:56:04.776 --> 01:56:06.477]  They refuse to hang out with them.
[01:56:07.503 --> 01:56:09.445]  This is not assimilation.
[01:56:09.865 --> 01:56:11.726]  This is going to turn into a disaster.
[01:56:12.307 --> 01:56:16.050]  We have to adapt to their culture, even though in many aspects it's worse.
[01:56:16.610 --> 01:56:19.012]  Yes, I dare say that their culture is worse than ours.
[01:56:19.052 --> 01:56:20.934]  You know, molesting boys in changing room.
[01:56:21.274 --> 01:56:22.535]  That's not a good culture.
[01:56:23.436 --> 01:56:24.938]  But we have to adapt to it.
[01:56:25.579 --> 01:56:29.964]  We have to change our own culture when they should be adapting to ours.
[01:56:30.544 --> 01:56:33.047]  Again, we see example after example of this.
[01:56:33.408 --> 01:56:37.572]  And now it's even happening in Germany with sausages.
[01:56:37.913 --> 01:56:39.394]  It's gone down to that level now.
[01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:48.083]  RT is reporting, anonymous hack Trump's voicemail revealed cozy relationship with media.
[01:56:48.783 --> 01:56:56.685]  So anonymous is presenting this as some kind of devastating revelation that they've caught Trump in these leaked voicemail messages.
[01:56:57.546 --> 01:57:02.567]  They actually talk about Trump donating money to a child's charity.
[01:57:03.288 --> 01:57:08.009]  So it's dressed up as some devastating revelation and basically they've got nothing.
[01:57:08.089 --> 01:57:09.890]  It's another one of these fake scandals.
[01:57:11.584 --> 01:57:13.945]  And on Donald Trump news, we've still got Facebook.
[01:57:14.045 --> 01:57:18.406]  We reported last week they failed to remove and assassinate Donald Trump page.
[01:57:18.906 --> 01:57:21.407]  Again, every single day I talk about this.
[01:57:22.027 --> 01:57:23.047]  Tweet after tweet.
[01:57:23.067 --> 01:57:25.268]  You can go on Twitter any day.
[01:57:25.428 --> 01:57:30.709]  There are hundreds and hundreds of tweets saying, oh gee, I hope somebody assassinates Donald Trump.
[01:57:30.749 --> 01:57:34.110]  There are many people directly threatening to do it themselves.
[01:57:34.970 --> 01:57:43.377]  In fact, there was a six-month gap until Twitter banned an Assassinate Donald Trump account, and that was only after we pointed it out.
[01:57:43.417 --> 01:57:45.719]  But we've got Alex Jones on the line now.
[01:57:45.819 --> 01:57:46.900]  Alex, welcome to the show.
[01:57:48.681 --> 01:57:55.567]  Paul, I have been watching in the last 20 minutes as I sit here working on a family matter, also taking care of a bunch of company business.
[01:57:55.867 --> 01:58:00.090]  A lot of exciting developments we're going to be able to tell folks about in the next few weeks.
[01:58:00.936 --> 01:58:07.202]  But I tell you, just listening to you the last 20 minutes or so, I missed part of your earlier breakdown last hour.
[01:58:08.353 --> 01:58:15.938]  The way you lay it out, and I've seen all the articles, I've seen all the stories, and then there's even piles more of demonization of Donald Trump.
[01:58:16.638 --> 01:58:20.200]  There is no way that the establishment isn't really coming after him.
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:28.865]  They are in a hysterical, psycho hissy fit, the likes of which I've never seen, and I gotta ask, why are they so scared of him?
[01:58:29.986 --> 01:58:34.349]  Ted Cruz, on a bunch of quote, policies, is better than Trump.
[01:58:34.989 --> 01:58:36.130]  I just don't trust Ted Cruz.
[01:58:36.890 --> 01:58:38.811]  Because of his association with Glenn Beck.
[01:58:39.772 --> 01:58:42.453]  So I want to ask you, we're coming back here in just 70 seconds.
[01:58:42.953 --> 01:58:44.674]  What do you think is going on?
[01:58:45.275 --> 01:58:46.795]  We'll break this down on a lot more.
[01:58:47.576 --> 01:58:48.716]  But what do I know, folks?
[01:58:48.796 --> 01:58:50.137]  Like Bernie Sanders said, I'm white.
[01:58:51.278 --> 01:58:54.679]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:54.699 --> 01:58:56.741]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:00.549 --> 01:59:02.532]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[01:59:02.612 --> 01:59:03.653]  Try a bottle of it.
[01:59:03.853 --> 01:59:05.295]  Rob Dew joins us.
[01:59:05.435 --> 01:59:08.259]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[01:59:08.559 --> 01:59:09.580]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:10.561]  I've been working all day.
[01:59:10.602 --> 01:59:12.944]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:59:13.085 --> 01:59:14.086]  I get in here at 830.
[01:59:14.506 --> 01:59:16.128]  I was kind of run down.
[01:59:16.409 --> 01:59:18.131]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[01:59:18.331 --> 01:59:20.193]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:59:20.213 --> 01:59:22.014]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[01:59:22.054 --> 01:59:22.815]  I popped two of them.
[01:59:23.095 --> 01:59:25.237]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[01:59:25.377 --> 01:59:27.258]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[01:59:27.359 --> 01:59:28.640]  It's got four and a half stars.
[01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:29.861]  People really love it.
[01:59:30.181 --> 01:59:30.701]  Read about it.
[01:59:30.781 --> 01:59:34.524]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[01:59:34.605 --> 01:59:39.889]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:59:40.029 --> 01:59:43.950]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without BrainForce.
[01:59:44.090 --> 01:59:49.911]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more BrainForce and came in.
[01:59:50.251 --> 01:59:55.492]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:59:55.652 --> 01:59:57.632]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:22.087 --> 02:00:34.737]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:00:35.358 --> 02:00:37.199]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:51.926 --> 02:00:53.047]  I was just asking Paul Watson.
[02:00:54.168 --> 02:00:56.310]  Trump does some things I don't like, and we've talked about it.
[02:00:57.530 --> 02:01:02.514]  But also, when he changes a view on something, he generally changes it to a better position.
[02:01:03.095 --> 02:01:04.456]  He flip-flops to something better.
[02:01:04.476 --> 02:01:05.337]  It's not a flip-flop.
[02:01:05.397 --> 02:01:07.218]  As he gets more info, he changes it.
[02:01:07.899 --> 02:01:11.482]  It's not like, oh, I'm against the TPP, but my wife helped write it for George.
[02:01:12.196 --> 02:01:15.779]  You know, W. Bush, like Ted Cruz.
[02:01:15.819 --> 02:01:19.321]  I'm not attacking Cruz, I'm just saying, it's not snakily done.
[02:01:19.722 --> 02:01:22.624]  Like, he's like, I want to torture ISIS people to find out where their bases are.
[02:01:22.644 --> 02:01:24.745]  We used to do that under Bush, right?
[02:01:24.765 --> 02:01:25.126]  It's legal.
[02:01:25.146 --> 02:01:26.306]  They're like, no sir, it's not.
[02:01:26.346 --> 02:01:28.628]  Well, I still think we should, but all right, I won't.
[02:01:29.369 --> 02:01:37.595]  I mean, the more I learn about Trump, he is almost like a hillbilly rich or something, with all the gold and palaces behind him and stuff.
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:48.968]  I mean, he's almost like a free market patriot version of, uh, of, uh, I don't know, just, just almost like a reality TV show or something, which we know he's all been part of.
[02:01:49.841 --> 02:01:52.542]  He's a maniac, but I mean that in a good way.
[02:01:53.362 --> 02:01:58.123]  And the whole system being against him for real means we have to ask, why are they so scared of him?
[02:01:58.943 --> 02:02:00.063]  Everybody keeps asking this question.
[02:02:00.423 --> 02:02:04.184]  They say, oh, he's channeling the populist anger.
[02:02:04.624 --> 02:02:12.186]  That's what they're scared of, is the populist anger getting basically fulfillment and then giving us confidence.
[02:02:12.546 --> 02:02:12.886]  That's 10% of it.
[02:02:14.616 --> 02:02:19.398]  That we start seeing we can get some change, we'll really start understanding how much power we have as a people.
[02:02:19.678 --> 02:02:21.599]  Every race, color, and creed working for human liberty.
[02:02:22.699 --> 02:02:23.600]  No, it's something bigger.
[02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:24.640]  It's Donald Trump.
[02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:27.341]  Because they could let somebody else ride a populist wave.
[02:02:28.422 --> 02:02:31.623]  They could attack somebody else, you know, here and there to get populist people behind them.
[02:02:32.464 --> 02:02:35.365]  With Trump, I'm sure it's legitimate and bona fide.
[02:02:36.341 --> 02:02:38.642]  Uh, and it just makes me ask, what is it?
[02:02:38.683 --> 02:02:41.184]  Paul Watson, we're going to break in a moment, but I want to ask you, you're a smart guy.
[02:02:41.504 --> 02:02:42.285]  I really want your views.
[02:02:42.325 --> 02:02:43.045]  I ponder on this.
[02:02:43.085 --> 02:02:44.646]  I think this is the answer to so much.
[02:02:45.106 --> 02:02:45.887]  What is it he's doing?
[02:02:45.927 --> 02:02:52.150]  David Knight would say, wants to target TPP, doesn't like China having unfair trade deals with us, and he's a nationalist.
[02:02:53.291 --> 02:02:54.572]  Uh, what do you think, Paul?
[02:02:56.525 --> 02:02:59.927]  I think Alex, they're just petrified of anyone they don't control.
[02:02:59.987 --> 02:03:04.188]  And the fact that he's so unpredictable, that's devastating to them.
[02:03:04.228 --> 02:03:08.971]  That absolutely chills them to the bone because it's never happened in modern American politics.
[02:03:09.511 --> 02:03:14.113]  And as he said, if you actually look at the people who are voting for him, as I did earlier,
[02:03:15.366 --> 02:03:21.450]  It proves that he's not being a divisive character because you have the Guardian coming out with, you know, who votes for Donald Trump.
[02:03:21.931 --> 02:03:24.392]  It's gay Arab Muslim students.
[02:03:24.813 --> 02:03:27.254]  It's liberal left-wing college professors.
[02:03:27.695 --> 02:03:36.620]  The Arab Muslim students petrified of mass immigration changing society because in many cases these people have worked hard, they've emigrated legally, they've done it the right way.
[02:03:37.101 --> 02:03:41.764]  You've got liberal college professors petrified of these social justice warriors who aren't liberals.
[02:03:42.324 --> 02:03:44.726]  So you've got a huge cross-section of people
[02:03:45.566 --> 02:03:50.787]  The Muslim support for Donald Trump outweighs all the rest of the geopolitical candidates combined.
[02:03:51.188 --> 02:03:52.248]  I mean, that's about it.
[02:03:52.428 --> 02:03:53.228]  That's huge numbers.
[02:03:53.588 --> 02:04:06.751]  Louis Farrakhan basically has endorsed him to us first, and then again, two more times, saying he's a nationalist, he's not owned by the globalists, and he went on to say you can't bring in radical Muslims, they're going to give everybody a bad name.
[02:04:06.971 --> 02:04:08.992]  Obviously, you've got to vet people.
[02:04:09.212 --> 02:04:12.294]  from a terror zone and at least look at their papers.
[02:04:12.554 --> 02:04:15.956]  I mean, and that's the outrageous racism of Donald Trump.
[02:04:16.876 --> 02:04:28.202]  And then you've got the crazy left doubling down, or not the left, the fascist cult mutations that they've turned into with Bernie Sanders saying white people have never, you know, been poor.
[02:04:28.242 --> 02:04:34.926]  That's like Melissa Harris Perry saying no one ever worked hard but black people when they said Paul Ryan will work hard to, you know, do this and that.
[02:04:35.766 --> 02:04:43.595]  They spin everything into some race-based system to traumatize not just white people or anybody else, but black people and others.
[02:04:43.995 --> 02:04:49.541]  Imagine being traumatized with that as you're a kid, told you see a brown paper bag if they want to be mean to you.
[02:04:50.022 --> 02:04:53.225]  You see a hall named Lynch, it scares you.
[02:04:53.666 --> 02:04:56.208]  You see the Attorney General's name, you know, you pee your pants.
[02:04:56.849 --> 02:05:02.253]  Oh my gosh, someone said, you know, he's a good spokesman or a good spokeswoman and we all conform to language.
[02:05:02.293 --> 02:05:14.543]  This is a cult of out of control freaks and they don't like the fact that Trump is uncontrolled and a wild man and we'll bring back in... Donald Trump is shaking up the world order and that's something we've needed for a very long time.
[02:05:14.804 --> 02:05:17.366]  For one thing, foreign diplomats are expressing alarm to U.S.
[02:05:17.406 --> 02:05:23.270]  government officials about what they claim are inflammatory and insulting public statements by Trump, according to senior U.S.
[02:05:23.351 --> 02:05:23.751]  officials.
[02:05:24.051 --> 02:05:28.914]  Officials from Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia have complained in recent private conversations about Trump's statements.
[02:05:29.254 --> 02:05:29.434]  U.S.
[02:05:29.494 --> 02:05:41.501]  officials said it was highly unusual for foreign diplomats to express concern, even privately, about candidates in the midst of a presidential campaign, because they don't want to be seen as meddling in domestic politics, considering that they will have to work with whoever wins.
[02:05:41.821 --> 02:05:49.145]  Additionally, senior leaders in several countries, including Britain, Mexico, France, and Canada, have already made public comments criticizing Trump's positions.
[02:05:49.485 --> 02:05:50.326]  And that's a good thing.
[02:05:50.566 --> 02:05:54.147]  America needs to quit catering to foreign politicians who want to destroy U.S.
[02:05:54.207 --> 02:05:55.047]  national sovereignty.
[02:05:55.067 --> 02:05:58.988]  And America needs to be more concerned about the needs of American citizens first before a foreign diplomat.
[02:05:59.108 --> 02:06:06.550]  There's way too many Americans out there living from paycheck to paycheck to worry about what a bunch of crybaby foreign diplomats say during their fancy lobster dinners paid for by taxpayers.
[02:06:06.890 --> 02:06:09.991]  This is Kit Daniels reporting for InfoWurst.com.
[02:06:10.431 --> 02:06:15.232]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.
[02:06:15.512 --> 02:06:16.332]  We're good to go.

[02:08:03.215 --> 02:08:04.836]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:04.916 --> 02:08:12.942]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:34.794 --> 02:08:36.115]  So I got cut off by the break.
[02:08:36.315 --> 02:08:37.356]  I walked all over it.
[02:08:38.776 --> 02:08:40.157]  Again, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:08:40.257 --> 02:08:41.278]  I didn't finish my point.
[02:08:43.059 --> 02:08:48.982]  They are afraid the establishment hates Donald Trump not because he's a focal point for populism.
[02:08:49.022 --> 02:08:50.423]  That's a small part of it.
[02:08:51.063 --> 02:08:54.185]  Not because even of his policies.
[02:08:55.926 --> 02:08:59.268]  They are scared of him because he literally does whatever he wants.
[02:09:00.606 --> 02:09:08.291]  They're scared of him because he doesn't listen to policy wonks, and he is his own man.
[02:09:09.572 --> 02:09:14.896]  And I've analyzed him, I've spent a year investigating him, and Donald Trump is for real.
[02:09:16.517 --> 02:09:17.598]  And I can say that unequivocally.
[02:09:18.258 --> 02:09:19.459]  It's not some double-cross.
[02:09:20.580 --> 02:09:21.820]  He is an unknown country.
[02:09:22.521 --> 02:09:23.822]  He is a genie in a bottle.
[02:09:24.542 --> 02:09:27.284]  They know what's coming out of the bottle, and they don't know what kind of genie this is.
[02:09:28.145 --> 02:09:29.626]  They just know there's green smoke shooting out.
[02:09:31.141 --> 02:09:31.862]  And they're scared.
[02:09:33.082 --> 02:09:37.545]  Now, that said, I'm scared of Donald Trump, too.
[02:09:38.246 --> 02:09:41.268]  I've really spent a lot of time thinking about this, and I'm going to be honest with everybody.
[02:09:41.888 --> 02:09:42.768]  I'm scared of Donald Trump.
[02:09:45.490 --> 02:09:48.092]  I overall think he is probably a good man.
[02:09:48.112 --> 02:09:51.454]  He's a super type A personality.
[02:09:51.474 --> 02:09:57.458]  More and more research is coming out with double Y and all these other chromosomes that men like him have.
[02:09:58.508 --> 02:10:05.192]  There's also genetic things that happen with these guys that can work 20 hours a day and just love to fight and love to do stuff.
[02:10:05.973 --> 02:10:12.577]  It's like a breed of German Shepherd that's the best at going into a building and going after folks and following orders.
[02:10:13.158 --> 02:10:14.458]  This is in different people.
[02:10:15.439 --> 02:10:21.303]  Some of it's for strength, some of it's for smarts, some of it is for deal-making, just being competitive.
[02:10:22.577 --> 02:10:23.678]  It's almost OCD.
[02:10:23.698 --> 02:10:28.883]  You get around a lot of powerful smart people and you learn what they're into is it possesses them.
[02:10:29.624 --> 02:10:30.204]  It is them.
[02:10:30.424 --> 02:10:31.465]  They love to fight.
[02:10:31.566 --> 02:10:34.128]  They love to work hard.
[02:10:34.368 --> 02:10:35.469]  They love to climb mountains.
[02:10:35.509 --> 02:10:38.752]  They love to push their bodies to the edge.
[02:10:39.633 --> 02:10:46.560]  Trump is a very interesting person and they're scared of him because he's a man.
[02:10:47.754 --> 02:10:50.598]  And he's not going to listen to them and do what they say.
[02:10:51.138 --> 02:10:52.240]  And he's not a eugenicist.
[02:10:52.300 --> 02:10:53.281]  He's not anti-human.
[02:10:54.783 --> 02:10:57.606]  He clearly has narcissistic traits like any successful person does.
[02:10:58.227 --> 02:11:01.631]  But he has big dreams and he wants humanity to do well.
[02:11:02.552 --> 02:11:03.434]  He likes pretty things.
[02:11:04.585 --> 02:11:10.947]  You look at the psychology of the Clintons and how they hire a bunch of really ugly, gross people to be around them and run things.
[02:11:10.987 --> 02:11:14.247]  And it's okay if somebody's physically ugly, but nice inside.
[02:11:14.287 --> 02:11:16.668]  No, they also hire really nasty people inside.
[02:11:17.248 --> 02:11:21.289]  And that's been shown in psychology to be part of a loathing and a hatred for humanity.
[02:11:21.749 --> 02:11:28.771]  Trump likes women, he likes having children, he likes wealth, he is like the ghost of Christmas present.
[02:11:29.952 --> 02:11:31.332]  Jolly old elf.
[02:11:32.145 --> 02:11:32.765]  They don't like that.
[02:11:33.105 --> 02:11:43.710]  Now when I say I'm scared of him, he could be manipulated, he could be tricked, he could be maneuvered by different factions if he gets in, and things could get out of control.
[02:11:45.271 --> 02:11:59.717]  But I'm more scared of the globalists because they have the whole thing rigged, but they're doing psychotic things like starting wars, genetic engineering, human clones, chimeras, thousands of other insane things, dumping glyphosates in the food and water, forcibly injecting us,
[02:12:01.738 --> 02:12:05.220]  And it is the people's will to vote for who they want.
[02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:10.923]  So I would say the evil spirit that runs the New World Order doesn't like Donald Trump for real.
[02:12:12.263 --> 02:12:13.924]  And so we have to be behind Donald Trump.
[02:12:15.325 --> 02:12:17.586]  But who knows what that is all going to lead into.
[02:12:17.946 --> 02:12:23.249]  But we're about to see spectacular things happen in the future.
[02:12:25.210 --> 02:12:26.811]  They don't want your populism vented.
[02:12:26.851 --> 02:12:28.852]  They don't want you to see that it bears fruits.
[02:12:28.892 --> 02:12:29.552]  You get confident.
[02:12:29.572 --> 02:12:30.092]  That's part of it.
[02:12:31.033 --> 02:12:31.393]  As I said,
[02:12:32.822 --> 02:12:39.429]  But the power structure wants to keep full control for itself, the bureaucracy, the political class.
[02:12:41.270 --> 02:12:42.431]  They're already out of control.
[02:12:42.972 --> 02:12:44.393]  They're a bunch of anti-human scum.
[02:12:45.374 --> 02:12:49.098]  They enjoy putting people down and hurting people.
[02:12:50.619 --> 02:12:51.300]  Donald Trump doesn't.
[02:12:52.321 --> 02:12:54.363]  He likes fighting bullies, people that attack him.
[02:12:55.144 --> 02:12:56.665]  Well, so do I. That's a normal trait.
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:04.065]  You're not a sadist if somebody's beating you up and you finally get a shot and knock them down.
[02:13:04.105 --> 02:13:05.966]  You get satisfied because you've survived.
[02:13:06.207 --> 02:13:07.828]  That's not being sadistic.
[02:13:08.729 --> 02:13:12.712]  Sadistic is pulling the legs off frogs like George W. Bush bragged he did.
[02:13:13.152 --> 02:13:14.313]  Sticking firecrackers in their mouths.
[02:13:15.253 --> 02:13:15.934]  Torturing animals.
[02:13:16.394 --> 02:13:16.995]  That's sadistic.
[02:13:18.103 --> 02:13:20.645]  And these people are sadistic, basically globalists.
[02:13:21.245 --> 02:13:22.266]  We're going to stand up against them.
[02:13:22.686 --> 02:13:25.969]  Alright folks, I'm going to throw this over to Paul Watson to speak more on this.
[02:13:26.329 --> 02:13:28.070]  I've got more special reports coming up as well.
[02:13:28.090 --> 02:13:33.074]  I'm going to be on tomorrow as well, but the next few days I'm taking care of a bunch of family matters and getting a bunch of business things done.
[02:13:33.514 --> 02:13:35.195]  Really exciting, positive things happening.
[02:13:36.056 --> 02:13:40.459]  Also, some of the biggest attacks ever from the globalists going on behind the scenes, so pray for us.
[02:13:41.179 --> 02:13:43.762]  I'm just honored to know Paul Watson for 15 years, since he was like 19 years old.
[02:13:59.941 --> 02:14:01.402]  And now here he is, 33, 34.
[02:14:01.602 --> 02:14:02.603]  Really honored to know you, Paul.
[02:14:02.663 --> 02:14:03.043]  Love you.
[02:14:03.063 --> 02:14:04.424]  And I love your brother.
[02:14:04.564 --> 02:14:12.768]  And I just love Leigh-Anne, and Jakari, and McBreen, and Dew, and just David Knight, and all the crew, the writers, everybody.
[02:14:13.228 --> 02:14:16.190]  We really are in a ship, engaging the enemy as hard as we can.
[02:14:16.230 --> 02:14:16.750]  We're committed.
[02:14:17.491 --> 02:14:19.452]  And amazing things are happening around us.
[02:14:19.632 --> 02:14:20.733]  And Donald Trump's only the beginning.
[02:14:21.013 --> 02:14:22.073]  He is a manifestation.
[02:14:22.113 --> 02:14:23.574]  The elite are scared of him because he's a real guy.
[02:14:23.754 --> 02:14:24.455]  And they don't control him.
[02:14:24.695 --> 02:14:25.395]  And he's pro-life.
[02:14:25.755 --> 02:14:27.256]  And I mean that in a larger sense, pro-human.
[02:14:27.656 --> 02:14:28.237]  Not just babies.
[02:14:29.645 --> 02:14:34.188]  And they're also scared of populist movement spreading.
[02:14:34.669 --> 02:14:38.011]  This shows how bankrupt the establishment is with the lowest approval rating in history.
[02:14:38.791 --> 02:14:40.633]  And they can't put the genie back in the bottle.
[02:14:40.693 --> 02:14:42.394]  So the genie's out.
[02:14:43.074 --> 02:14:48.638]  We better try to be nice to the genie and direct the genie so that it doesn't tear things up.
[02:14:49.298 --> 02:14:50.860]  But this genie is not part of the New World Order.
[02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:51.760]  Donald Trump is not that.
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:56.303]  And there's going to be more coming out of Pandora's box now because the elite have brought in chaos.
[02:14:56.884 --> 02:14:58.465]  They have sowed the whirlwind.
[02:14:59.522 --> 02:15:01.162]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:15:01.182 --> 02:15:02.163]  Spread that link to everyone you know.
[02:15:02.423 --> 02:15:03.883]  And stations you're listening to, spread that link.
[02:15:04.063 --> 02:15:07.004]  And buy the products at Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[02:15:07.604 --> 02:15:14.505]  The more money you spend, the stronger we can be to have the reporters, to get more reporters, more writers, and withstand like a seawall.
[02:15:15.105 --> 02:15:16.885]  Money is a seawall in this modern world.
[02:15:16.946 --> 02:15:17.486]  It's energy.
[02:15:18.766 --> 02:15:21.126]  And I'm a bomber going in against the enemy territory.
[02:15:21.166 --> 02:15:21.786]  And I need fuel.
[02:15:22.327 --> 02:15:23.607]  I need information that is weapons.
[02:15:24.047 --> 02:15:25.787]  And I will go in enemy territory.
[02:15:25.867 --> 02:15:27.888]  I am committed like a human cruise missile.
[02:15:28.208 --> 02:15:29.108]  I'm going into my target.
[02:15:30.083 --> 02:15:30.904]  And I will not stop.
[02:15:31.604 --> 02:15:36.907]  But your funds, your prayers, your support, your commitment, your allegiance is what I need.
[02:15:36.967 --> 02:15:42.451]  I give you my allegiance and my commitment to never falter or waver in the enemy's face.
[02:15:43.611 --> 02:15:44.352]  So help me God.
[02:15:44.992 --> 02:15:48.514]  And again, go with God, ask for Christ's empowerment.
[02:15:49.115 --> 02:15:49.515]  Paul Watson.
[02:15:51.459 --> 02:15:56.561]  There goes Alex Jones, and again, on the subject of Donald Trump, which Alex was getting into there.
[02:15:57.082 --> 02:16:00.263]  He's talking about his personal behaviour, which is interesting if you look into it.
[02:16:01.024 --> 02:16:04.585]  You know, this is a guy who doesn't drink a drop of alcohol.
[02:16:04.605 --> 02:16:06.626]  This is a guy who's never done drugs in his life.
[02:16:07.006 --> 02:16:10.508]  And I don't care if you do that, that's part of your personal lifestyle, that's your choice.
[02:16:10.968 --> 02:16:15.290]  This guy is completely focused, he's completely committed.
[02:16:15.310 --> 02:16:18.012]  He's consumed, he's obsessed by what he does.
[02:16:18.652 --> 02:16:26.417]  He's a workaholic and you can often judge how true people are, how authentic they are by the kind of personal lifestyle they lead.
[02:16:26.777 --> 02:16:31.840]  He doesn't even shake anybody's hand because he doesn't want to get ill, he doesn't want to pick up germs.
[02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:36.223]  So that gives you an insight into how focused he is, how committed he is.
[02:16:36.977 --> 02:16:39.180]  We got this article out of Gateway Pundit.
[02:16:39.220 --> 02:16:40.282]  This is very interesting.
[02:16:49.312 --> 02:16:59.655]  So of course we know that the Republican establishment have now basically, they've not even really thrown their support behind Rubio or Cruz, they've thrown their support behind Hillary Clinton.
[02:17:00.255 --> 02:17:02.656]  Because they're trying to get this brokered convention.
[02:17:03.096 --> 02:17:14.480]  We could see Mitt Romney, the two-time presidential loser who likes to lecture everybody about the state of the presidential race, come in at a later stage to try and take away these delegates from Trump.
[02:17:15.691 --> 02:17:27.341]  But on Fox News Sunday, Rush Limbaugh pointed out that even with a brokered convention, the Republican nominees must have won a majority of delegates in at least eight states.
[02:17:28.041 --> 02:17:33.166]  So far, only one candidate qualifies with 12 state victories, Donald Trump.
[02:17:33.946 --> 02:17:41.593]  So even if the GOP establishment wants to nominate a Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney, which we speculated and Roger Stone has speculated could happen,
[02:17:42.557 --> 02:17:48.721]  They couldn't because they have not won a majority of delegates in any state, let alone eight states.
[02:17:49.502 --> 02:17:51.383]  This is a convention rule.
[02:17:51.743 --> 02:17:54.285]  It was adopted at the 2012 convention.
[02:17:54.885 --> 02:18:03.871]  So they're going to have to actually change the rules of their own convention if they want to get Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan in at this broken convention.
[02:18:04.571 --> 02:18:06.573]  So those are the lengths they're going to have to go to.
[02:18:07.602 --> 02:18:11.805]  But again, going back to Trump, you know what you're going to get with Marco Rubio.
[02:18:11.905 --> 02:18:12.786]  You know that now.
[02:18:13.126 --> 02:18:14.267]  You're going to get a sellout.
[02:18:14.487 --> 02:18:16.469]  You know what you're going to get with Hillary Clinton.
[02:18:16.589 --> 02:18:18.230]  You're going to get a sellout.
[02:18:19.091 --> 02:18:23.775]  And even if Trump has flip-flopped on some of these issues, which, let's be fair, he has,
[02:18:25.484 --> 02:18:26.945]  At least he's unpredictable.
[02:18:27.045 --> 02:18:32.087]  At least you know that if the right people are talking to him, you can sway his opinion.
[02:18:32.467 --> 02:18:34.708]  We saw that with the refugee issue.
[02:18:35.208 --> 02:18:39.350]  You know, Trump came out initially and said, yeah, we should just let all these migrants come in there.
[02:18:39.810 --> 02:18:40.510]  They're suffering.
[02:18:40.590 --> 02:18:42.051]  It's a humanitarian disaster.
[02:18:42.751 --> 02:18:49.579]  He obviously wasn't knowledgeable about the situation at the time, which is that, you know, four-fifths of these people weren't from Syria.
[02:18:50.279 --> 02:18:52.582]  The vast majority of them were young men.
[02:18:52.782 --> 02:18:53.763]  They weren't families.
[02:18:54.584 --> 02:19:00.791]  And ISIS, in their own documents, has openly come out and said, we're going to infiltrate terrorists along with these, quote, refugees.
[02:19:00.871 --> 02:19:03.534]  And they did it before the Paris massacre.
[02:19:04.275 --> 02:19:12.522]  Those were the issues, those were the reasons why I and many other people have opposed the mass influx of Muslim migrants without proper vetting.
[02:19:13.023 --> 02:19:17.847]  Trump wasn't knowledgeable about that at the time, so he said, yeah, let's just let them all in.
[02:19:18.187 --> 02:19:22.171]  He got absolutely panned for that, and subsequently changed his opinion.
[02:19:23.091 --> 02:19:29.177]  So yes, there's an unsure atmosphere about the fact that he's unpredictable, and yes, he does flip-flop.
[02:19:30.216 --> 02:19:52.528]  But if you get a Marco Rubio, if you get a Hillary Clinton, they're not going to flip-flop on the base fundamentals of supporting the military-industrial complex, of involving America in all these pointless, disastrous foreign wars, the very kind that led to Libya, to Syria, to this humanitarian disaster in the first place.
[02:19:52.848 --> 02:19:56.931]  At least you know with Donald Trump, you've got a chance to prevent that.
[02:19:57.691 --> 02:20:06.455]  And that's one of the reasons why even many on the left now, again 1,000 people in Ohio, turning from Democrat to Republican, are voting for Donald Trump.
[02:20:06.475 --> 02:20:07.755]  We'll be back after the break.
[02:20:07.775 --> 02:20:10.336]  This is the Alex Jones Show live, InfoWars.com.
[02:20:10.356 --> 02:20:12.837]  You want to raise the next generation of patriot leaders?
[02:20:13.117 --> 02:20:14.818]  Take a look at Freedom Project Academy.
[02:20:15.058 --> 02:20:18.000]  A Judeo-Christian online school for kindergarten through high school.
[02:20:18.300 --> 02:20:20.822]  No common core teaching methods or high-stakes testing.
[02:20:21.022 --> 02:20:27.006]  Freedom Project Academy is government-free, doesn't accept any government funding, and is a fully accredited private school.
[02:20:27.386 --> 02:20:30.508]  All classes are taught live online with real teachers across the country.
[02:20:30.708 --> 02:20:33.950]  Open enrollment runs March through July, but classes fill up quickly.
[02:20:34.170 --> 02:20:36.892]  Check them out at fpeusa.org.
[02:20:37.072 --> 02:20:39.093]  That's fpeusa.org.
[02:20:40.293 --> 02:20:43.055]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[02:20:43.355 --> 02:20:45.956]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[02:20:45.996 --> 02:20:46.417]  Croix River.
[02:20:46.737 --> 02:20:48.738]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[02:20:48.958 --> 02:20:51.680]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:52.440]  His excuse?
[02:20:52.801 --> 02:20:53.861]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[02:20:54.141 --> 02:20:55.422]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[02:20:55.742 --> 02:21:01.246]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[02:21:01.506 --> 02:21:02.226]  Don't wait.
[02:21:02.547 --> 02:21:04.908]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now.

[02:21:13.271 --> 02:21:17.616]  Hey, I rode the elevator with you, but I don't work on the upper floors.
[02:21:18.037 --> 02:21:24.584]  I just want to squeeze in there right next to you, so the RFID scanner in my pocket can capture all your personal information.
[02:21:24.925 --> 02:21:27.988]  Your debit and credit cards, even your work ID badge.
[02:21:28.409 --> 02:21:30.732]  So your identity is now my identity.
[02:21:31.332 --> 02:21:31.793]  Going up?
[02:21:32.733 --> 02:21:40.659]  So am I. For over 10 years, ID Stronghold has pioneered RFID-blocking wallets and ID badge holders for consumers, the U.S.
[02:21:40.699 --> 02:21:43.442]  military, and even the Executive Office of the President.
[02:21:43.982 --> 02:21:45.503]  Shouldn't you be protected too?
[02:21:46.124 --> 02:21:50.807]  ID Stronghold wallets cost about the same as wallets in most stores, but give you extra protection.
[02:21:51.108 --> 02:21:53.830]  I'm Wal Augustinowitz, founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[02:21:54.130 --> 02:21:56.011]  Don't be a victim of electronic pickpocketing.
[02:21:56.212 --> 02:22:00.175]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID Stronghold wallets, card sleeves, and purses.

[02:22:10.558 --> 02:22:17.423]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[02:22:17.563 --> 02:22:21.985]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.

[02:22:38.476 --> 02:22:38.676]  I think?
[02:23:08.336 --> 02:23:08.967]  It's on Facebook!
[02:23:09.921 --> 02:23:13.742]  Serious investors and traders want to make 81% return in 60 seconds?

[02:24:24.807 --> 02:24:27.029]  We are back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:27.049 --> 02:24:37.316]  Now, if you thought that Mark Dice couldn't top his previous videos in exposing the American public's alarming lack of knowledge about their own country's history, then think again.
[02:24:37.336 --> 02:24:39.378]  Here's Mark Dice's latest video.
[02:24:41.588 --> 02:24:44.771]  Who is our nation's capital named after?
[02:24:44.851 --> 02:24:48.674]  Oh my god, okay, um... See, why are you gonna ask me something like that?
[02:24:48.734 --> 02:24:50.155]  Can I Google it?
[02:24:50.635 --> 02:24:52.617]  Nope, gotta... It should be in your memory.
[02:24:52.957 --> 02:24:54.838]  The nation's capital named after who?
[02:24:55.119 --> 02:24:55.819]  Okay, who's the name?
[02:24:55.839 --> 02:24:56.259]  What's our name?
[02:24:56.440 --> 02:24:57.020]  Why are you leaving me?
[02:24:57.040 --> 02:24:57.841]  You're supposed to be helping me!
[02:24:57.861 --> 02:24:58.661]  Don't worry, it's just you.
[02:24:58.821 --> 02:25:05.667]  Oh my god, okay, the nation's capital... The nation's capital... Okay, then you're not... Okay, I understand.
[02:25:06.047 --> 02:25:08.509]  Who is the nation's capital named after?
[02:25:10.330 --> 02:25:10.750]  I don't know.
[02:25:10.991 --> 02:25:11.431]  I give up.
[02:25:12.352 --> 02:25:13.092]  I plead the fifth.
[02:25:13.693 --> 02:25:16.054]  Who is our nation's capital named after?
[02:25:16.074 --> 02:25:18.436]  Our nation's capital?
[02:25:19.377 --> 02:25:20.377]  Who is it named after?
[02:25:20.498 --> 02:25:21.518]  I have no idea.
[02:25:21.538 --> 02:25:22.299]  You have to tell us.
[02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:25.381]  The capital of America.
[02:25:25.401 --> 02:25:28.563]  It's named after a certain person.
[02:25:30.065 --> 02:25:30.905]  I have no idea.
[02:25:30.925 --> 02:25:34.288]  I have no idea.
[02:25:34.328 --> 02:25:35.108]  George Washington?
[02:25:36.549 --> 02:25:37.150]  Are you sure?
[02:25:37.490 --> 02:25:38.331]  No, I don't really care.
[02:25:39.426 --> 02:25:41.167]  It doesn't matter about these things, right?
[02:25:41.287 --> 02:25:41.568]  Right.
[02:25:42.228 --> 02:25:44.450]  So you're not really sure who it's named after?
[02:25:44.470 --> 02:25:45.231]  Um, no.
[02:25:45.551 --> 02:25:45.831]  No.
[02:25:46.171 --> 02:25:47.432]  You can Google it.
[02:25:47.832 --> 02:25:48.693]  You can Google it.
[02:25:49.574 --> 02:25:50.034]  Okay.
[02:25:50.615 --> 02:25:51.095]  You do that.
[02:25:53.717 --> 02:25:57.700]  I'm gonna have to go with, uh... Yeah, I don't know.
[02:25:59.181 --> 02:25:59.902]  George Washington.
[02:25:59.922 --> 02:26:00.122]  Okay.
[02:26:00.442 --> 02:26:01.663]  We gotta talk to the millennials.
[02:26:01.723 --> 02:26:02.804]  They've lost their minds.
[02:26:02.944 --> 02:26:03.725]  They won't know.
[02:26:03.905 --> 02:26:05.226]  They're not gonna have a clue.
[02:26:05.246 --> 02:26:05.946]  No, thank you.
[02:26:06.567 --> 02:26:07.267]  I like that shirt.
[02:26:07.688 --> 02:26:07.948]  Thank you.
[02:26:09.952 --> 02:26:12.133]  You getting the shirt in there?
[02:26:12.274 --> 02:26:14.635]  Our nation's capital is named after who?
[02:26:14.655 --> 02:26:21.360]  I don't know.
[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:23.641]  Man, I just woke up.
[02:26:24.001 --> 02:26:25.342]  What is this for anyways?
[02:26:25.362 --> 02:26:26.363]  Where'd you get that shirt at?
[02:26:27.624 --> 02:26:28.184]  I don't remember.
[02:26:29.765 --> 02:26:31.366]  What does the shirt stand for?
[02:26:31.386 --> 02:26:34.468]  I love Washington, D.C.
[02:26:35.369 --> 02:26:37.450]  Who is that city named after?
[02:26:38.071 --> 02:26:38.571]  Washington.
[02:26:39.665 --> 02:26:40.226]  There we go.
[02:26:40.726 --> 02:26:40.946]  Who?
[02:26:41.827 --> 02:26:42.547]  Uh, Washington.
[02:26:42.708 --> 02:26:43.748]  Which, who Washington?
[02:26:46.451 --> 02:26:53.136]  Um, Washington, uh... President Washington.
[02:26:53.917 --> 02:26:54.177]  First name.
[02:26:54.257 --> 02:26:55.498]  It's his first name.
[02:26:55.758 --> 02:27:00.042]  Um... Man, I'm having a... a blank right now.
[02:27:04.085 --> 02:27:04.205]  Um...
[02:27:09.421 --> 02:27:09.741]  Anything?
[02:27:10.142 --> 02:27:12.283]  No, it's not coming.
[02:27:12.563 --> 02:27:13.343]  Well, that's a nice shirt.
[02:27:13.664 --> 02:27:14.044]  Thank you.
[02:27:14.424 --> 02:27:15.164]  I'm just out of it.
[02:27:15.204 --> 02:27:16.245]  Yeah, okay.
[02:27:16.265 --> 02:27:17.646]  Sorry about that.
[02:27:17.726 --> 02:27:18.706]  Quick question for you.
[02:27:18.727 --> 02:27:19.707]  Okay.
[02:27:20.848 --> 02:27:23.729]  Our nation's capital is named after who?
[02:27:26.771 --> 02:27:30.333]  Our nation's capital is Washington, D.C.
[02:27:32.034 --> 02:27:33.255]  And I don't know who it's named after.
[02:27:33.275 --> 02:27:35.656]  A president.
[02:27:37.077 --> 02:27:37.718]  Some president.
[02:27:37.858 --> 02:27:38.278]  I don't know.
[02:27:39.509 --> 02:27:40.029]  Is it you?
[02:27:41.430 --> 02:27:42.490]  You're on the right track.
[02:27:43.451 --> 02:27:45.051]  George Washington?
[02:27:45.152 --> 02:27:46.212]  Okay, good for you.
[02:27:47.232 --> 02:27:47.793]  We're just checking.
[02:27:48.073 --> 02:27:48.353]  Okay.
[02:27:48.373 --> 02:27:49.513]  Should I pass?
[02:27:49.934 --> 02:27:50.134]  Yeah.
[02:27:51.294 --> 02:27:54.335]  Our nation's capital is named after who?
[02:27:56.176 --> 02:27:59.598]  Oh god, this is Jay Leno thing.
[02:27:59.778 --> 02:28:00.478]  Answer the question.
[02:28:00.498 --> 02:28:01.819]  Lincoln.
[02:28:07.190 --> 02:28:08.491]  Lincoln, D.C.
[02:28:09.412 --> 02:28:09.992]  Washington.
[02:28:10.012 --> 02:28:12.774]  Okay, thank you.
[02:28:13.074 --> 02:28:15.255]  Who is our nation's capital named after?
[02:28:15.275 --> 02:28:16.536]  We're Italians.
[02:28:16.676 --> 02:28:17.717]  Oh, you're Italians.
[02:28:17.877 --> 02:28:18.717]  Oh, this would be even better.
[02:28:19.638 --> 02:28:21.699]  The capital of America, the city.
[02:28:21.899 --> 02:28:23.400]  Yeah, after George Washington.
[02:28:23.420 --> 02:28:25.061]  You're right, it is!
[02:28:25.081 --> 02:28:26.502]  You guys are on vacation from Italy?
[02:28:26.642 --> 02:28:26.862]  Yeah.
[02:28:26.982 --> 02:28:27.963]  That is awesome.
[02:28:28.663 --> 02:28:30.384]  We're just talking to stupid Americans.
[02:28:31.065 --> 02:28:34.347]  Many of them don't know who our nation's capital is named after.
[02:28:34.867 --> 02:28:35.747]  How is that possible?
[02:28:35.767 --> 02:28:37.648]  Because they just lost their minds.
[02:28:38.148 --> 02:28:38.468]  Yeah.
[02:28:39.048 --> 02:28:42.930]  You think Americans are overwhelmingly dumber than Italians?
[02:28:43.010 --> 02:28:43.310]  Yes.
[02:28:43.730 --> 02:28:44.210]  Probably.
[02:28:44.670 --> 02:28:45.971]  You won't offend me at all.
[02:28:45.991 --> 02:28:46.711]  Sometimes.
[02:28:46.851 --> 02:28:47.431]  Sometimes.
[02:28:47.611 --> 02:28:47.891]  Yeah.
[02:28:48.171 --> 02:28:49.252]  In many cases, probably.
[02:28:49.472 --> 02:28:50.812]  And a lot fatter too, aren't they?
[02:28:51.352 --> 02:28:52.012]  Probably, yes.
[02:28:52.372 --> 02:28:54.953]  I saw a lot of videos like this one.
[02:28:55.113 --> 02:28:57.394]  Oh yeah, making fun of Americans is a pastime.
[02:28:58.394 --> 02:28:59.495]  Thank you, so have a good vacation.
[02:28:59.535 --> 02:29:00.055]  You too, bye!
[02:29:03.479 --> 02:29:03.579]  Yes.
[02:29:19.079 --> 02:29:22.243]  The visiting tourists from Italy are the only ones that know the answer.
[02:29:22.303 --> 02:29:23.505]  Absolutely alarming, once again.

[02:29:58.669 --> 02:29:59.289]  Stay tuned.
[02:29:59.949 --> 02:30:00.849]  We're on the march.
[02:30:01.349 --> 02:30:02.950]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.890 --> 02:30:06.551]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.819 --> 02:30:12.820]  And yet another example of cultural suicide.
[02:30:12.981 --> 02:30:17.244]  Germany is now banning pork sausages in schools so they don't, quote, offend Muslim migrants.
[02:30:17.524 --> 02:30:24.729]  An increasing number of public schools and child daycare centers have stopped serving pork sausages, bacon, and ham over, quote, religious considerations.
[02:30:25.049 --> 02:30:32.715]  But in backlash, members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's party are fighting to keep pork on the menu, insisting the consumption of pork is part of German culture.
[02:30:32.915 --> 02:30:38.119]  Daniel Gunther, party representative, said, quote, the protection of minorities, including for religious reasons,
[02:30:38.339 --> 02:30:38.659]  Let's go.
[02:31:08.319 --> 02:31:08.524]  Yeah.
[02:31:10.046 --> 02:31:13.249]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:13.569 --> 02:31:21.575]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:21.815 --> 02:31:26.840]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:31:27.240 --> 02:31:29.522]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:32:11.119 --> 02:32:14.522]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:32:14.882 --> 02:32:22.027]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:32:22.628 --> 02:32:31.034]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:32:31.234 --> 02:32:35.397]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:32:35.657 --> 02:32:39.440]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastic,
[02:32:39.480 --> 02:32:39.800]  We're good.
[02:33:14.530 --> 02:33:17.134]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:28.186 --> 02:33:39.168]  We are back on Alex Jones Show Live with Joseph Watson and I'm delighted to be joined by Lauren Southern, who of course is a Libertarian Party candidate, activist and YouTuber.
[02:33:39.708 --> 02:33:41.309]  She works with the rebel media.
[02:33:42.229 --> 02:33:52.551]  And if you want an example of somebody who's built a platform, who has become fantastically successful in reaching new people just over the course of the past, what, eight, nine months alone?
[02:33:53.211 --> 02:34:01.354]  This is somebody who's got 23 million views on one video alone on Facebook, her Why I'm Not a Feminist video.
[02:34:01.754 --> 02:34:05.636]  This is somebody who's really risen to prominence over the course of the last eight months.
[02:34:06.216 --> 02:34:19.241]  Really a shining example to everyone else who thinks that they can't have an impact, that they can't build an independent media platform, that they can't have their own megaphone, because she's proven that that's entirely possible.
[02:34:20.091 --> 02:34:32.358]  And that's made her a target, and we saw that in evidence once again over the weekend, when she was assaulted by the liberal, tolerant, leftist social justice warriors.
[02:34:32.678 --> 02:34:36.520]  We're going to show that video as she's talking about it, but Lauren, welcome to the show.
[02:34:37.400 --> 02:34:38.521]  Hi Paul, thanks for having me.
[02:34:39.922 --> 02:34:45.385]  So just explain to the listeners what this event was, why you were there, and then tell us what happened.
[02:34:46.300 --> 02:34:48.640]  Sure, I'll try to make it as short as possible.
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:54.601]  It's a bit of a long story, but we were supposed to have a speaker, Augustus Sol Invictus, come up to Vancouver.
[02:34:54.641 --> 02:34:55.962]  He's an interesting guy.
[02:34:56.042 --> 02:35:01.963]  Obviously, not a lot of people... There's mixed feelings about him, but either way, it was going to be a fascinating speech.
[02:35:02.763 --> 02:35:14.405]  And these anti-fascist protesters, who are convinced he's a neo-Nazi with very little evidence, called the place we were planning on having the speech and got it shut down at the railway club.
[02:35:14.977 --> 02:35:17.239]  By harassing them until they shut down our event.
[02:35:17.819 --> 02:35:25.644]  And then, because they had sent him threats online and were planning on having a violent protest against him, he was not allowed into the country.
[02:35:25.724 --> 02:35:29.867]  They actually stopped him at the border and told him, sorry, you cannot come into Canada.
[02:35:30.748 --> 02:35:32.249]  Because you'll just throw up trouble.
[02:35:33.380 --> 02:35:51.771]  And so we ended up just having a drinking night downtown, and all of these anti-fascist protesters had still shown up around the area that we were in, wearing balaclavas, masks covering their faces, all wearing black, and we kind of got into an argument with them about free speech.
[02:35:51.831 --> 02:35:54.753]  Like, why would you guys not support free speech?
[02:35:56.642 --> 02:36:09.265]  Um, and I saw one of the girls I knew from the Slut Walk who had created a petition about me, lying about me, saying that, sent it to my employer, sent it to my party trying to get me fired, and I got into a discussion with her.
[02:36:09.665 --> 02:36:15.567]  We talked about gender politics, and I guess I triggered them enough that someone came up behind me
[02:36:16.448 --> 02:36:26.152]  And poured what I believe to be pop over my face and hair, and I was like, oh my goodness, and then one of my friends is like, Lauren, that smells like piss.
[02:36:26.232 --> 02:36:27.653]  I think that might be piss.
[02:36:28.513 --> 02:36:32.415]  Plus, these people have said they were buying- We can see the video now that they're playing the video.
[02:36:32.875 --> 02:36:35.977]  So, was it ever determined what the substance was?
[02:36:37.492 --> 02:36:42.975]  Well, I mean, honestly, I couldn't smell it that well, but the two guys I was with, I was like, guys, please tell me this is pop.
[02:36:43.215 --> 02:36:44.256]  Please tell me it's pop.
[02:36:44.436 --> 02:36:46.677]  And they're like, Lauren, I can smell it.
[02:36:46.937 --> 02:36:48.238]  I'm pretty confident it's this.
[02:36:48.278 --> 02:36:51.660]  So I'd say, plus they had said on the page they were going to bring
[02:36:52.321 --> 02:36:52.681]  You're in.
[02:36:52.821 --> 02:37:00.323]  I still would like to keep my hopefulness that it is just thought, but it's very likely that it was.
[02:37:01.803 --> 02:37:06.524]  The hate crime that you committed was you just calmly having a debate with these people.
[02:37:06.864 --> 02:37:09.204]  You said there were only two genders.
[02:37:09.484 --> 02:37:18.766]  That was the vitriolic hate speech that triggered this individual, which, I mean, we couldn't even tell who it was at first because they all had their faces covered.
[02:37:18.786 --> 02:37:22.007]  Of course, these anti-fascists who exhibit
[02:37:22.467 --> 02:37:27.489]  All the characteristics of fascists, they violently assault people with whom they disagree.
[02:37:27.929 --> 02:37:32.090]  So, did you ever find out who actually poured this substance over your head?
[02:37:32.910 --> 02:37:40.012]  I think I have, like, people have been sending me their own personal videos they had on their phone, and I believe it was a female that did it.
[02:37:40.413 --> 02:37:44.714]  I'm not 100% confident, but in the video, I believe it was a female that ran off.
[02:37:45.656 --> 02:37:46.977]  I don't plan on pressing charges.
[02:37:47.017 --> 02:37:50.478]  I honestly don't want to waste the police time with this nonsense.
[02:37:51.118 --> 02:37:53.099]  I'm not going to play the professional victim.
[02:37:53.940 --> 02:37:58.662]  Choosing to be a victim after the fact of being harassed or something and acting like a victim is a choice.
[02:37:58.802 --> 02:38:00.402]  All I had to do was take a shower.
[02:38:00.422 --> 02:38:01.223]  I've been getting...
[02:38:01.903 --> 02:38:10.206]  I've seen terrible tweets from people saying I deserved it, saying you look like a drowned rat, get cancer, but I can ignore those as well.
[02:38:10.226 --> 02:38:12.427]  I don't have to be a professional victim about this.
[02:38:12.767 --> 02:38:16.189]  I'm just exposing the regressive left.
[02:38:16.389 --> 02:38:25.032]  And it's amazing to see these people who are supposedly protesting fascism, showing up with their faces hidden, assaulting people and shutting down free speech.
[02:38:26.893 --> 02:38:28.874]  These are the oldest people, aren't you?
[02:38:28.914 --> 02:38:29.494]  Great job.
[02:38:30.831 --> 02:38:31.451]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:38:31.471 --> 02:38:34.552]  I mean, I've been at protests with these kind of individuals.
[02:38:34.573 --> 02:38:37.874]  You know, they're mostly whiny, privileged teenagers.
[02:38:38.214 --> 02:38:40.975]  They claim to represent minorities and poor people.
[02:38:41.235 --> 02:38:45.577]  At the end of the protest, you know, their parents come and pick them up in their top-of-the-range Mercedes.
[02:38:45.817 --> 02:38:47.078]  They're complete hypocrites.
[02:38:47.438 --> 02:38:55.761]  But I wanted to ask you about, you know, how did the White Knight male feminists on Twitter react to a woman getting assaulted for her opinion?
[02:38:55.781 --> 02:38:57.922]  They must have leapt to your defense, right?
[02:38:59.144 --> 02:39:00.446]  Well, oh yeah, definitely.
[02:39:00.526 --> 02:39:09.079]  No, I've been getting, I honestly, I thought I would get at least a few people with the little feminist and pronouns in their profiles saying like, this is wrong.
[02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:14.467]  But every single person that has said, good, I'm happy this happened, you deserved it, has
[02:39:15.788 --> 02:39:29.817]  And for some of them, I'm honestly a little impressed because I'm like, wow, you do have the cognitive abilities to question what a woman is saying.
[02:39:29.857 --> 02:39:32.419]  You do have the cognitive abilities to say, I need proof.
[02:39:32.979 --> 02:39:34.740]  I'm going to call you a liar until I have proof.
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:38.663]  And I don't necessarily agree with calling someone a liar until they show you proof.
[02:39:39.463 --> 02:39:45.165]  It's like, why can't you apply this to everyone and be skeptical of everyone's stories until you're given proof?
[02:39:45.205 --> 02:39:46.786]  Why just the people you disagree with?
[02:39:46.846 --> 02:39:48.346]  Why just the people you disagree with?
[02:39:48.426 --> 02:39:50.967]  Are you saying you're making this up for attention?
[02:39:51.007 --> 02:39:53.388]  It's just phenomenal to see that.
[02:39:55.066 --> 02:39:58.267]  Yeah, they're now actually accusing you of just fabricating the whole incident.
[02:39:58.687 --> 02:40:02.008]  But I mean, if this had happened to one of them, right?
[02:40:02.068 --> 02:40:05.790]  We have them whining every single day about mean tweets.
[02:40:06.170 --> 02:40:09.311]  Meanwhile, they're physically blocking people at Ben Shapiro lectures.
[02:40:09.911 --> 02:40:13.312]  They're giving out bomb threats to Gamergate meetups.
[02:40:13.652 --> 02:40:17.534]  But if somebody on our side, the libertarian side or whatever you want to call it,
[02:40:18.194 --> 02:40:19.254]  Did the same thing to them.
[02:40:19.695 --> 02:40:27.938]  They would whine about it for weeks, you know, about how it was a dangerous indication about how they're being violently oppressed and how it was violent intimidation.
[02:40:28.318 --> 02:40:36.141]  They do this kind of thing routinely and they get away with it because as you said, you're not going to press charges, the police have got better things to do.
[02:40:36.721 --> 02:40:41.023]  Do you think at some point we have to push back just to send the message that this isn't acceptable?
[02:40:42.915 --> 02:40:50.121]  I'd like to think we can win by just being, in fact I think we are winning people over by just showing we're more reasonable.
[02:40:50.181 --> 02:40:58.368]  I'm seeing people in the comments section saying this is why I'm no longer an SJW regressive liberal because their actions have proved who they are.
[02:40:58.468 --> 02:41:01.531]  So go ahead liberals, or regressive left.
[02:41:03.092 --> 02:41:08.978]  Pulling fire alarms, keep throwing drinks, please no acid attacks, just drinks or even urine on people.
[02:41:09.178 --> 02:41:14.183]  Because you are exposing yourselves for the hateful people that you are when you do this.
[02:41:14.383 --> 02:41:21.971]  And if you keep showing the rest of the world this, I really hope they will follow suit and challenging your regressive tactics.
[02:41:26.806 --> 02:41:33.911]  You know, as a straight, white, cisgendered male, God forbid, I would expect to get more hate than you, right?
[02:41:34.171 --> 02:41:39.135]  But from everything I've seen, you get ten times the amount of hate as anyone.
[02:41:39.495 --> 02:41:42.958]  Even like the most prominent, you know, anti-SJWs, the men.
[02:41:43.658 --> 02:41:47.281]  You get the hate, and it's mostly from feminist women, right?
[02:41:47.781 --> 02:41:59.951]  So we have this thing about, you know, feminists demanding that we have this pretense of equality when it comes to diversity of opinion, yet when you express your diversity of opinion, they come down on you hard.
[02:42:00.331 --> 02:42:07.597]  Have you noticed that you get more heat from women than men who they would deride as sexist and misogynist?
[02:42:08.658 --> 02:42:10.379]  Yeah, well I'm a gender traitor, right?
[02:42:10.479 --> 02:42:10.880]  So it's...
[02:42:12.161 --> 02:42:13.061]  It only makes sense.
[02:42:14.582 --> 02:42:16.583]  I'm supposed to agree with them naturally.
[02:42:16.623 --> 02:42:17.663]  And you know what's hilarious?
[02:42:17.723 --> 02:42:22.545]  Whenever I disagree with them, I always get the, I bet you've never been raped.
[02:42:22.645 --> 02:42:24.245]  That's why you disagree with us.
[02:42:25.386 --> 02:42:28.427]  They assume there must be something wrong with her.
[02:42:28.467 --> 02:42:29.087]  She's a woman.
[02:42:29.147 --> 02:42:30.407]  She has to agree with us.
[02:42:30.547 --> 02:42:31.468]  Oh, she wasn't raped.
[02:42:32.828 --> 02:42:36.810]  It's unreal the excuses they come up with for me not agreeing with them.
[02:42:36.850 --> 02:42:39.952]  I mean, I have my own ability to think on my own.
[02:42:40.072 --> 02:42:43.013]  Women in general have their own ability to make their own decisions.
[02:42:43.113 --> 02:42:44.314]  You just don't want them to.
[02:42:44.394 --> 02:42:46.655]  You want them to all fall in line.
[02:42:46.675 --> 02:42:52.077]  And it's amazing that hashtag believe women does not apply to me.
[02:42:52.097 --> 02:42:57.240]  It does not apply to women who are on the wrong side of politics.
[02:42:58.732 --> 02:43:08.818]  And of course, I mean, if you take their definition of rape, which is, you know, basically just any kind of vocal sexual advance whatsoever, then everybody's been raped, I guess.
[02:43:08.858 --> 02:43:09.018]  Yeah.
[02:43:09.318 --> 02:43:11.739]  But there was a comment which I want to focus on.
[02:43:12.540 --> 02:43:19.124]  This was a comment left in response to this incident, and we can roll this video again of you being assaulted with the urine or whatever it was.
[02:43:19.784 --> 02:43:39.884]  This is how one of these leftists responded, quote, So that's a supposed anti-fascist advocating that we cave a 20-year-old woman's head in because she disagrees with their opinion.
[02:43:40.264 --> 02:43:43.628]  Now, you know, correct me if I'm wrong, but who's the fascist here?
[02:43:44.804 --> 02:43:47.629]  Right, I don't think these people know what libertarianism is.
[02:43:48.250 --> 02:43:49.472]  These people are desperate.
[02:43:49.833 --> 02:43:54.180]  Desperate to find racism, Nazism in everything.
[02:43:54.220 --> 02:43:54.801]  They are going to...
[02:43:55.920 --> 02:43:59.703]  Libertarian events, just hoping that there's something they can be offended by.
[02:44:25.741 --> 02:44:26.864]  She should have been killed.
[02:44:27.185 --> 02:44:31.336]  I mean, I should be pulling an Anita Sarkeesian right now.
[02:44:31.376 --> 02:44:33.963]  I should start my Patreon and start getting victim bucks.
[02:44:35.489 --> 02:44:38.049]  You should go to the United Nations and do a speech immediately.
[02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:46.371]  But another thing I wanted to talk about was I mentioned your video on Facebook, which 23 million views on this one video on Facebook.
[02:44:46.611 --> 02:44:50.992]  I mean, I got some heat for the Islam video and I think this is where it's coming from.
[02:44:51.532 --> 02:44:55.893]  You've been censored on Facebook repeatedly over the past few weeks.
[02:44:55.933 --> 02:45:00.773]  You've been suspended for basically milquetoast mild comments, jokes.
[02:45:01.213 --> 02:45:04.114]  Explain to people what's happening with the Facebook censorship.
[02:45:05.225 --> 02:45:05.486]  Right.
[02:45:06.147 --> 02:45:10.895]  I thought Twitter was getting bad with the shadow banning, but Facebook is just straight out...
[02:45:11.926 --> 02:45:14.567]  Banning people, suspending their account.
[02:45:15.167 --> 02:45:20.990]  I just had mine suspended for three days, unable to post because I posted a joke about feminism.
[02:45:21.030 --> 02:45:24.931]  It was quite clearly a joke that did not violate any of Facebook's standards.
[02:45:25.211 --> 02:45:27.692]  And it was posted around two, three months ago as well.
[02:45:27.732 --> 02:45:31.094]  So they're looking through my feed to find things to ban me for.
[02:45:31.954 --> 02:45:38.517]  Someone was just banned last week for saying that someone on FemFreak was using an ad hominem attack.
[02:45:40.021 --> 02:45:44.766]  We are getting banned for pointing out fallacies, for just questioning leftist ideology.
[02:45:44.826 --> 02:45:50.671]  It is amazing how little they care to even hide the fact that they are just banning people for their views.
[02:45:51.112 --> 02:45:58.899]  And I believe you sent me this morning a post that was from a guy who was making anti-white speech.
[02:45:58.979 --> 02:46:00.420]  It was racist against whites.
[02:46:00.620 --> 02:46:05.565]  And he said, I have friends at Facebook, so my week-long ban only lasted for five hours.
[02:46:06.161 --> 02:46:12.983]  If you don't think there's something going on here, if you don't think there's preference politically with these bans on Facebook, you are dead wrong.
[02:46:13.503 --> 02:46:14.163]  Dead wrong.
[02:46:14.964 --> 02:46:16.484]  And you're going to see a lot more banning.
[02:46:16.504 --> 02:46:18.184]  This is the case.
[02:46:18.285 --> 02:46:24.326]  We have Twitter, we've got the admitted reports now about Twitter that they've got insiders who are overseeing these shadow bans.
[02:46:24.706 --> 02:46:30.768]  As you said, we've got this leftist Tim Wise who basically got banned for some racist thing he said against white people.
[02:46:31.288 --> 02:46:33.429]  Because what's going on is we've got now
[02:46:33.889 --> 02:46:41.597]  Mobs of anti-SJWs using SJW's own tactic against them by mass-reporting their posts.
[02:46:41.997 --> 02:46:43.238]  Now, I disagree with that.
[02:46:43.559 --> 02:46:49.905]  I mean, I see YouTube videos about me removed for hate speech constantly because a bunch of people are reporting them.
[02:46:50.225 --> 02:46:51.486]  And that's... I don't want that.
[02:46:51.606 --> 02:46:52.587]  I mean, I don't agree with that.
[02:46:52.607 --> 02:46:53.628]  That's not my principle.
[02:46:54.346 --> 02:47:01.889]  But we've got it happening now where they've got people on the inside that are coming and saying, yeah, we can get that ban lifted because we agree with you politically.
[02:47:02.369 --> 02:47:05.010]  And people say, well, why don't you just get off Facebook?
[02:47:05.030 --> 02:47:06.851]  Why don't you just build your own social network?
[02:47:07.271 --> 02:47:12.273]  Well, that's impossible for a start because Facebook and Twitter, that's where the battleground is.
[02:47:13.013 --> 02:47:17.995]  And you spend years and years, right, building up your social media platform.
[02:47:18.055 --> 02:47:21.536]  It takes hours, hundreds of hours of effort, sometimes years.
[02:47:21.856 --> 02:47:22.917]  You have to build that up.
[02:47:22.977 --> 02:47:23.977]  It's a lot of work.
[02:47:24.317 --> 02:47:27.678]  So that's why we care about being censored on Twitter and Facebook.
[02:47:27.958 --> 02:47:33.260]  It's not a matter of saying, oh, if your video gets taken down off YouTube, just put it up on your own website.
[02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:35.821]  No, because the audience is at YouTube.
[02:47:36.041 --> 02:47:38.102]  We're fighting on their battleground, right?
[02:47:38.922 --> 02:47:45.903]  And the scary part here is, you're seeing a lot of libertarians that are trying to make a fair point, saying, these are private companies, they're free to do that.
[02:47:46.564 --> 02:47:51.465]  I have to actually disagree with that point, because these are companies that are involved politically.
[02:47:51.525 --> 02:47:56.325]  You see Zuckerberg meeting with Merkel, and that is no longer just an issue of a private company.
[02:47:56.366 --> 02:47:58.106]  This is political influence.
[02:47:58.146 --> 02:48:03.187]  This is politics influencing the public on a platform that is widely used by the public.
[02:48:03.227 --> 02:48:08.668]  They're using it to win elections, to change people's mind on very important political issues.
[02:48:09.503 --> 02:48:14.328]  And it's so much more than just this is a private company.
[02:48:14.368 --> 02:48:15.910]  This is political.
[02:48:15.950 --> 02:48:20.014]  This is 100% political and they're going to affect elections with this.
[02:48:20.394 --> 02:48:26.861]  They're going to affect how the world moves forward using these social media platforms and with censorship.
[02:48:27.501 --> 02:48:33.923]  And it's a bit scary to think if one of us were just banned permanently from both Facebook, what would happen?
[02:48:33.983 --> 02:48:40.565]  There have been people, I can't even remember their names, there was a guy who ran a site similar to Drudge Report on Twitter and he was just permanently banned.
[02:48:40.965 --> 02:48:45.787]  No one remembers his name anymore, everyone's forgotten about him and it's very scary to think that could happen.
[02:48:45.827 --> 02:48:51.949]  So people need to fight back, they need to make sure that doesn't happen to people with dissenting views.
[02:48:53.550 --> 02:48:55.111]  You talk about influencing elections.
[02:48:55.171 --> 02:48:59.692]  I mean, I'm looking at a post now which got somebody suspended on Twitter.
[02:49:00.312 --> 02:49:01.132]  This is what he said.
[02:49:01.193 --> 02:49:01.833]  This is a quote.
[02:49:02.333 --> 02:49:04.374]  Trump never said all Mexicans.
[02:49:04.434 --> 02:49:06.494]  He specifically talked about illegal immigrants.
[02:49:06.554 --> 02:49:08.475]  Last time I checked, Islam is not a race.
[02:49:08.515 --> 02:49:14.457]  And if you are so worried about Nazi ideology, worry about Bernie Sanders who is a socialist as Hitler and the Nazi Party were.
[02:49:15.097 --> 02:49:17.278]  That was removed from Facebook.
[02:49:17.318 --> 02:49:28.362]  So now you can't defend a statement that Donald Trump made, or you can't attack Bernie Sanders politically with a legitimate comment without being banned on Facebook.
[02:49:28.402 --> 02:49:32.843]  So if this is the standard, then yes, it's going to influence elections.
[02:49:32.883 --> 02:49:35.564]  And as you said, it has real world consequences.
[02:49:35.864 --> 02:49:40.206]  I mean, there was a guy in the Netherlands who got a home visit from the police.
[02:49:40.726 --> 02:49:46.808]  Because he sent out a tweet saying that he thought his government's refugee plan was a bad policy.
[02:49:47.148 --> 02:49:48.009]  That's all he said.
[02:49:48.029 --> 02:49:49.689]  He got a home visit from the police.
[02:49:50.069 --> 02:49:59.293]  So now we've got, with this expansion of hate speech, to include basically anything and having the wrong political opinion, it's leading to official oppression.
[02:49:59.733 --> 02:50:04.156]  So that makes it a bigger issue than, oh, Twitter and Facebook are just private companies.
[02:50:04.477 --> 02:50:12.963]  They're now fused together, working directly with governments to meter out this official oppression for people who have the wrong opinions, correct?
[02:50:14.264 --> 02:50:14.504]  Right.
[02:50:14.584 --> 02:50:20.689]  And it's hilarious to see, like, when Milo went to the White House press meeting and said, are you guys going to do something about this?
[02:50:20.729 --> 02:50:26.774]  They suddenly pull out the conservative, oh, it's a private company argument that they would never use in any other case.
[02:50:26.834 --> 02:50:27.894]  They would condemn
[02:50:29.076 --> 02:50:42.303]  The companies, I can't remember what it was, something Chick-fil-A, they would condemn something like Chick-fil-A that was anti-gay in 2008, but suddenly it's a private company when it comes to censorship against conservatives.
[02:50:43.817 --> 02:50:49.419]  Yeah, like Melissa's Cakes was a private company, but they got hounded and harassed, you know, they got put out of business.
[02:50:49.759 --> 02:50:55.521]  We'll be back, though, after the break with Lauren Southern, going to tell you how you can reach her on her YouTube channel.
[02:50:55.881 --> 02:51:03.063]  Also going to hit a final few news stories here on the final segment of the Alex Jones Show live, InfoWars.com.
[02:51:03.164 --> 02:51:03.844]  Don't go away.
[02:51:03.904 --> 02:51:04.384]  We'll be back.
[02:51:11.209 --> 02:51:21.800]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[02:51:22.120 --> 02:51:26.025]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[02:51:26.285 --> 02:51:28.107]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:28.447 --> 02:51:33.913]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:34.053 --> 02:51:43.836]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:51:44.076 --> 02:51:50.338]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:51:50.578 --> 02:51:53.899]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for a diabetic.
[02:51:53.919 --> 02:51:55.740]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:51:55.980 --> 02:51:59.081]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:51:59.181 --> 02:51:59.581]  I think so.
[02:52:20.450 --> 02:52:24.073]  Turn $250 into $4,903 in just 7 clicks of a mouse.

[02:53:18.971 --> 02:53:21.132]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?
[02:53:21.312 --> 02:53:24.794]  Are you willing to gamble your family's safety that it'll never happen to you?

[02:53:51.431 --> 02:53:52.292]  They don't want to see us
[02:54:24.582 --> 02:54:39.293]  So Lauren Southern, assaulted by balaclava-wearing fascists, who call themselves anti-fascists, but daring to have a different opinion.
[02:54:39.373 --> 02:54:42.936]  Her opinion was to say there were only two genders.
[02:54:43.516 --> 02:54:49.562]  And for that hate crime, she got urine dumped over her head from the tolerant, loving Liberals.
[02:54:50.082 --> 02:54:52.144]  Lauren, just final comments on this.
[02:54:52.885 --> 02:54:53.605]  Tell us where it's going.
[02:54:53.625 --> 02:54:55.047]  You said you're not going to press charges.
[02:54:55.107 --> 02:54:57.089]  Is this the end of the matter as far as you're concerned?
[02:54:57.529 --> 02:55:02.013]  Tell us your future plans coming up and how people can find you on YouTube and Twitter.
[02:55:02.994 --> 02:55:03.515]  For sure.
[02:55:03.655 --> 02:55:07.058]  No, I'm not going to press charges just because I don't want to waste police time.
[02:55:07.138 --> 02:55:09.100]  If anything happens
[02:55:10.154 --> 02:55:11.475]  Similar to that, that's worse.
[02:55:11.575 --> 02:55:13.476]  I probably will, obviously.
[02:55:14.296 --> 02:55:16.458]  But I don't want to be a professional victim.
[02:55:16.518 --> 02:55:23.742]  I just want to clarify to people that you may be victimized in some way, but acting like a victim is a choice.
[02:55:23.782 --> 02:55:25.983]  You don't have to act like a victim after the fact.
[02:55:26.023 --> 02:55:26.783]  You can laugh it off.
[02:55:26.803 --> 02:55:29.825]  You have to find the humor in these things and in life in general.
[02:55:30.265 --> 02:55:31.786]  And I wish feminists could do that as well.
[02:55:31.826 --> 02:55:33.347]  We'd get along a lot better if they did.
[02:55:34.540 --> 02:55:37.521]  And we might upload more footage to The Rebel Media.
[02:55:37.561 --> 02:55:40.403]  If you want to see more of my stuff, please check out therebel.media.
[02:55:40.663 --> 02:55:46.786]  You can find me on Twitter, at Lauren underscore Southern, or my YouTube channel, which you can just search my name, Lauren Southern.
[02:55:48.566 --> 02:55:50.087]  Okay, Lauren, thanks for joining us.
[02:55:50.107 --> 02:55:51.528]  Thanks for having me.
[02:55:52.654 --> 02:55:53.675]  There goes Lauren Southern.
[02:55:53.695 --> 02:55:56.756]  Be sure to check out her on YouTube and Twitter.
[02:55:57.317 --> 02:56:04.921]  Again, she's the target of most of this hate and harassment, while social justice warriors whine about being harassed because somebody disagrees with them on Twitter.
[02:56:05.641 --> 02:56:12.125]  Like Gregory Allen Elliott, who was dragged through court for two years and basically had his life ruined because he disagreed with a feminist.
[02:56:13.075 --> 02:56:21.939]  She's taking the heat right now because she's got viral videos out there in which she dares to disagree with their opinion which, according to them, is a form of violence.
[02:56:22.379 --> 02:56:32.444]  They feel violently threatened if you disagree with them politically and respond by violently assaulting people because they're not hypocrites at all, of course not.
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:36.983]  And on that subject, of course we had the death of Nancy Reagan over the weekend.
[02:56:37.564 --> 02:56:39.546]  Ronald Reagan's wife, former first lady.
[02:56:40.386 --> 02:56:48.834]  Compare the vitriol spewed by leftists after her death to the kind of stuff that they whine about when it comes from conservatives.
[02:56:48.854 --> 02:56:50.795]  This is out of alanbus.com.
[02:56:51.336 --> 02:56:55.700]  Within 30 minutes, look what liberals were posting about Nancy Reagan's death.
[02:56:56.567 --> 02:57:06.531]  So basically Breitbart collected this sample of tweets and the immediate, the immediate aftermath, there was no time to relent after it was announced that Nancy Reagan had died.
[02:57:07.732 --> 02:57:12.474]  I can't even read out these tweets because they're so vitriolic and profane.
[02:57:13.094 --> 02:57:16.416]  One of them says, I told my pops that Nancy Reagan died today and he said,
[02:57:17.245 --> 02:57:18.886]  Let the good times roll!
[02:57:19.666 --> 02:57:20.267]  Here's another one.
[02:57:20.527 --> 02:57:21.727]  Nancy Reagan dies at 94.
[02:57:22.528 --> 02:57:23.408]  Who gives an F?
[02:57:23.888 --> 02:57:25.749]  Mike Brown died at 18.
[02:57:26.410 --> 02:57:32.833]  Yes, Mike Brown, the criminal who tried to grab Officer Darren Wilson's gun and then charged at him and was shot dead.
[02:57:33.573 --> 02:57:35.154]  That's the equivalency they're making.
[02:57:36.034 --> 02:57:36.555]  Here's another one.
[02:57:36.575 --> 02:57:37.835]  A moment of silence, please.
[02:57:38.115 --> 02:57:39.196]  Okay, that's enough.
[02:57:39.776 --> 02:57:40.857]  F Nancy Reagan!
[02:57:41.874 --> 02:57:42.554]  Here's another one.
[02:57:42.695 --> 02:57:44.556]  Yes, so happy Nancy Reagan died.
[02:57:44.636 --> 02:57:45.857]  Mad it took so long.
[02:57:46.537 --> 02:57:48.178]  It goes on and on and on.
[02:57:48.559 --> 02:58:00.467]  So after every single, you know, anyone basically linked with being a conservative dies, the vitriol, the hate, the profanity is spewed on Twitter in the immediate aftermath.
[02:58:00.487 --> 02:58:02.989]  This is because these people have no class whatsoever.
[02:58:03.649 --> 02:58:09.791]  They're violent, they're intolerant, they harass people while complaining about being harassed.
[02:58:10.352 --> 02:58:12.553]  Classic victim mentality.
[02:58:12.953 --> 02:58:13.973]  They're cry-bullies.
[02:58:14.313 --> 02:58:15.794]  We see it over and over again.
[02:58:16.514 --> 02:58:25.438]  And yet over on Facebook, somebody who dares to defend a Donald Trump statement or question Bernie Sanders is immediately censored.
[02:58:26.297 --> 02:58:27.698]  Lauren Southern's been censored.
[02:58:27.718 --> 02:58:35.043]  She's only just came back on Facebook today for making a joke or simply retweeting, reposting somebody who made a joke about feminism.
[02:58:35.423 --> 02:58:38.725]  This is important because it has real-world consequences.
[02:58:39.846 --> 02:58:41.447]  We're going to be back in the next segment.
[02:58:41.467 --> 02:58:44.730]  I'll be here for the next short segment on the Alex Jones Show Live.
[02:58:44.750 --> 02:58:48.952]  That's going to wrap it up for the initial three-hour broadcast of InfoWars Nightly News tonight.
[02:58:49.032 --> 02:58:50.854]  Thanks for joining us, InfoWars.com.
[02:58:53.188 --> 02:58:57.185]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:59:00.373 --> 02:59:04.674]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Supermail and then when Superfemale came out, tell us what happened.
[02:59:05.014 --> 02:59:09.635]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:59:09.775 --> 02:59:10.795]  Talk about the effects.
[02:59:11.115 --> 02:59:12.596]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:59:12.616 --> 02:59:14.216]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:59:14.536 --> 02:59:17.437]  I feel like I look better, I feel better, I feel sexier.
[02:59:17.777 --> 02:59:18.137]  I love it.
[02:59:18.397 --> 02:59:24.058]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge, get a bottle of Supermail, a bottle of Superfemale,
[02:59:24.318 --> 02:59:25.339]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:59:25.379 --> 02:59:26.419]  Consult your physician.
[02:59:26.579 --> 02:59:28.780]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today.
[02:59:28.940 --> 02:59:29.881]  This is life-changing.
[02:59:30.261 --> 02:59:31.021]  Shower filters.
[02:59:31.162 --> 02:59:32.802]  We're introducing the best yet.
[02:59:32.882 --> 02:59:36.804]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[02:59:36.964 --> 02:59:41.567]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[02:59:41.767 --> 02:59:48.710]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[02:59:48.850 --> 02:59:51.812]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free shipping
[02:59:52.132 --> 02:59:53.734]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:24.329 --> 03:00:30.621]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:35.441 --> 03:00:35.921]  We are back.
[03:00:36.021 --> 03:00:37.602]  It's the Alex Jones Show fourth hour.
[03:00:37.662 --> 03:00:39.122]  Rob Dew is coming up.
[03:00:39.162 --> 03:00:42.164]  But again at the top of the show we played the Bernie Sanders clip.
[03:00:42.784 --> 03:00:47.246]  Basically saying that white people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[03:00:47.806 --> 03:00:50.367]  And again this is a continuation of this race baiting.
[03:00:50.427 --> 03:00:56.349]  He's obviously pandering to the black vote because that's mainly in the camp of Hillary Clinton at this point.
[03:00:57.089 --> 03:01:00.771]  So Bernie Sanders basically came out and said white people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[03:01:01.511 --> 03:01:03.572]  Again, completely inaccurate.
[03:01:03.612 --> 03:01:05.854]  You look at the census figures in America.
[03:01:05.874 --> 03:01:09.176]  18.9 million whites are poor.
[03:01:09.536 --> 03:01:11.538]  They qualify as being in poverty.
[03:01:12.158 --> 03:01:16.521]  That's 8 million more poor white people than poor black people.
[03:01:16.841 --> 03:01:22.165]  It's 5 million more poor white people than those who identify as Latino.
[03:01:22.485 --> 03:01:27.068]  So again, that's not saying that Latinos and black people aren't disproportionately poor.
[03:01:27.448 --> 03:01:27.929]  They are!
[03:01:28.709 --> 03:01:32.652]  But 70% of African-Americans aren't in poverty.
[03:01:33.072 --> 03:01:39.317]  So many of them were outraged at Sanders for making this implication that all black people are poor.
[03:01:39.777 --> 03:01:44.040]  So again, it's another example of this race-baiting and it's completely erroneous.
[03:01:44.100 --> 03:01:45.922]  You look at the food stamp recipients.
[03:01:47.062 --> 03:01:52.446]  10% Hispanic, 25% African-American, 40% white.
[03:01:53.547 --> 03:01:55.569]  Most people on food stamps are white.
[03:01:56.499 --> 03:01:58.380]  So again, this is completely inaccurate.
[03:01:58.600 --> 03:02:00.761]  It's Bernie Sanders pandering to the black vote.
[03:02:01.322 --> 03:02:11.707]  This ties into a video that I put up on YouTube last week in which I outline how it's great to be racially discriminated against for being white and the fact that I love my white privilege.
[03:02:11.727 --> 03:02:12.328]  Here's the video.
[03:02:15.484 --> 03:02:17.586]  I love my white male privilege.
[03:02:17.786 --> 03:02:26.493]  I love being made to feel collective white guilt for the slave trade, even though whites were the first in the world to end the slave trade.
[03:02:26.653 --> 03:02:32.198]  I love being made to feel collective white guilt for the slave trade, even though whites were the first to encourage...
[03:02:32.598 --> 03:02:35.740]  Everyone else in the world to end the slave trade.
[03:02:35.981 --> 03:02:45.187]  I love being made to feel collective white guilt for the slave trade, despite the fact that the Islamic slave trade was far more brutal and lasted for much longer.
[03:02:45.367 --> 03:02:54.294]  I love being made to feel collective white guilt for the slave trade, despite the fact that the Islamic slave trade murdered over a hundred and twelve million
[03:02:54.594 --> 03:02:55.375]  Black people.
[03:02:55.535 --> 03:03:06.088]  I love being made to feel collective white guilt for the slave trade despite the fact that more whites were abducted and enslaved by Muslims than the number of blacks enslaved by whites.
[03:03:06.268 --> 03:03:12.396]  I love being made to feel collective white guilt for the slave trade 150 years after it was ended in the West
[03:03:12.916 --> 03:03:17.478]  As a result of the deaths of hundreds of thousands of white males.
[03:03:17.738 --> 03:03:21.500]  I love being made to feel collective white guilt over the slave trade.
[03:03:21.740 --> 03:03:24.981]  Despite the fact that only 1.4% of whites own slaves, compared to 28% of free blacks.
[03:03:30.144 --> 03:03:38.529]  I love being made to feel collective white guilt for colonialism, as if white people were the only race to invade and conquer other countries.
[03:03:38.769 --> 03:03:48.916]  I love being told I'm a racist when I criticize the violent aspects of Islam, because not all Muslims are violent, and to collectively blame all Muslims is bigoted.
[03:03:49.016 --> 03:03:53.719]  While being collectively blamed whenever a lunatic goes on a shooting spree,
[03:03:54.079 --> 03:03:56.841]  Because I happen to share the same skin colour as him.
[03:03:56.941 --> 03:04:01.164]  I just love being told I'm a racist for condemning Muslim rape gangs.
[03:04:01.444 --> 03:04:06.668]  Because not all Muslims are rapists, and to collectively blame all Muslims is bigoted.
[03:04:06.708 --> 03:04:18.657]  While being lectured all day not to rape women, and being collectively treated as a would-be rapist, because of made-up statistics about a college rape culture that doesn't exist.
[03:04:18.957 --> 03:04:28.148]  I love how my white male privilege allows me to be judged collectively while being told I'm a racist for judging other people collectively.
[03:04:28.288 --> 03:04:31.392]  I just love my white male privilege, I can't get enough of it!
[03:04:31.592 --> 03:04:37.419]  I love how my male privilege entitles me to be 11 times more likely to die at the workplace
[03:04:37.759 --> 03:04:45.670]  I love how my male privilege entitles me to contribute to 99.9% of combat deaths and casualties.
[03:04:45.790 --> 03:04:52.519]  I love how my male privilege entitles me to be five times more likely to commit suicide than a woman.
[03:04:52.639 --> 03:04:53.100]  I love
[03:04:53.260 --> 03:04:58.202]  How my male privilege gives me just a 15% chance of winning custody of my children.
[03:04:58.302 --> 03:05:04.184]  And I just love how my male privilege means I'm three times more likely to be homeless than a woman.
[03:05:04.384 --> 03:05:09.706]  I love how my male privilege means I get more than double the prison sentence than a woman.
[03:05:10.489 --> 03:05:14.492]  Donald Trump is shaking up the world order, and that's something we've needed for a very long time.
[03:05:14.752 --> 03:05:17.315]  For one thing, foreign diplomats are expressing alarm to U.S.
[03:05:17.355 --> 03:05:23.219]  government officials about what they claim are inflammatory and insulting public statements by Trump, according to senior U.S.
[03:05:23.279 --> 03:05:23.720]  officials.
[03:05:24.020 --> 03:05:28.884]  Officials from Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia have complained in recent private conversations about Trump's statements.
[03:05:29.224 --> 03:05:29.404]  U.S.
[03:05:29.444 --> 03:05:36.208]  officials said it was highly unusual for foreign diplomats to express concern, even privately, about candidates in the midst of a presidential campaign.
[03:05:36.508 --> 03:05:41.450]  Because they don't want to be seen as meddling in domestic politics, considering that they will have to work with whoever wins.
[03:05:41.771 --> 03:05:49.094]  Additionally, senior leaders in several countries, including Britain, Mexico, France, and Canada, have already made public comments criticizing Trump's positions.
[03:05:49.434 --> 03:05:50.275]  And that's a good thing.
[03:05:50.535 --> 03:05:54.097]  America needs to quit catering to foreign politicians who want to destroy U.S.
[03:05:54.157 --> 03:05:55.018]  national sovereignty.
[03:05:55.138 --> 03:05:58.960]  And America needs to be more concerned about the needs of American citizens first before a foreign diplomat.
[03:05:59.060 --> 03:06:06.524]  There's way too many Americans out there living from paycheck to paycheck to worry about what a bunch of crybaby foreign diplomats say during their fancy lobster dinners paid for by taxpayers.
[03:06:06.864 --> 03:06:09.946]  This is Kit Daniels reporting for InfoWurst.com.
[03:06:10.406 --> 03:06:16.790]  Our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[03:06:17.230 --> 03:06:20.432]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[03:06:20.452 --> 03:06:26.737]  Needed to get my digestive system working correctly again, so I stumbled on the X2.
[03:06:26.777 --> 03:06:30.180]  We look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2.
[03:06:30.400 --> 03:06:33.962]  It's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[03:06:34.263 --> 03:06:35.984]  I needed a detox, basically.
[03:06:40.996 --> 03:06:44.460]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[03:06:44.660 --> 03:06:45.702]  What do you have to lose?
[03:06:45.982 --> 03:06:54.553]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[03:06:54.993 --> 03:06:58.856]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[03:06:58.896 --> 03:07:00.378]  I was like really more natural.

[03:08:19.714 --> 03:08:23.638]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:24.559 --> 03:08:29.443]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:39.253 --> 03:08:41.374]  Alright, welcome everyone to the fourth hour.
[03:08:41.414 --> 03:08:45.016]  This is Rob Dew hosting the fourth hour of Overdrive, the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:45.557 --> 03:08:52.521]  Paul Joseph Watson and Alex were kind of tag teaming there earlier in the show.
[03:08:52.641 --> 03:08:56.383]  I'm going to talk about the BLM a little bit and what's going on with this Bundy standoff.
[03:08:56.403 --> 03:09:04.708]  It looks like 19 people now have been arrested from an incident that happened coming up on two years now.
[03:09:05.800 --> 03:09:09.401]  And I also want to talk about something Hillary Clinton said yesterday in the debate.
[03:09:09.481 --> 03:09:15.224]  I watched a little bit of it, tweeted out a few things, and one was a big lie that she tweeted out.
[03:09:15.244 --> 03:09:20.326]  It's like one of her biggest lies that, you know, I think she told in that debate, and we'll get to that.
[03:09:20.746 --> 03:09:34.671]  And also, you guys saw the Bernie baby video earlier about the Bernie baby dying, and I tweeted that out immediately when I heard that because it was right at four months, which is when, if you look at the vaccine schedule, that's when you're due to get
[03:09:35.191 --> 03:09:38.814]  Four different shots, some of which have multiple vaccines in them.
[03:09:39.135 --> 03:09:40.416]  Multiple viruses, I guess.
[03:09:40.436 --> 03:09:42.458]  They're trivalent or hexavalent vaccines.
[03:09:42.978 --> 03:09:44.860]  There's that tweet I sent out last night.
[03:09:45.020 --> 03:09:48.823]  Hillary, you forgot to mention vaccine makers, absolute immunity, stop lying.
[03:09:48.864 --> 03:09:49.764]  Sent that out last night.
[03:09:49.964 --> 03:09:51.766]  And that was echoed by other people.
[03:09:51.986 --> 03:09:53.348]  A real popular...
[03:09:53.968 --> 03:10:01.252]  Twitter guy out there, Tanner's dad, who tweets a lot of vaccine information out, tweeted out pretty much the exact same thing.
[03:10:01.993 --> 03:10:09.437]  And it's good to see people were not just taking these comments lightly that Hillary Clinton made, and she was talking about gun manufacturers have absolute immunity.
[03:10:09.738 --> 03:10:15.201]  See, the thing with guns is nobody forces you to go buy a gun and then forces you to shoot anybody.
[03:10:15.501 --> 03:10:18.443]  They're literally now forcing people to take vaccines.
[03:10:18.963 --> 03:10:20.404]  They're forcing it on you.
[03:10:20.444 --> 03:10:25.766]  So I hope you took that Bernie baby report to heart because it is sad when you have a little baby like that.
[03:10:26.266 --> 03:10:34.990]  I listened to the newscast of the mother crying on the phone talking to the reporter how, you know, she has no idea.
[03:10:35.430 --> 03:10:45.880]  And I guarantee if she was a hardcore socialist type Democrat person who's voting for Bernie that she's probably standing in line like the rest of the cattle out there getting their vaccine.
[03:10:45.900 --> 03:10:46.561]  So it's sad.
[03:10:46.681 --> 03:10:49.464]  It's very sad to see but that's not happening to my kids.
[03:10:50.005 --> 03:10:54.869]  And we're going to get to a BLM report we played on the Nightly News on Friday that David Knight voiced over.
[03:10:54.889 --> 03:10:57.932]  And if you were here Friday during the fourth hour,
[03:10:58.573 --> 03:11:03.824]  David and I really broke it down how, where all this federal power grab is going and what it's going to lead to.
[03:11:03.844 --> 03:11:06.749]  It's going to lead to, you know, more open revolt.
[03:11:07.839 --> 03:11:14.124]  With the cartridge box, you know, what we're seeing now with Donald Trump is the ballot box revolt, and people hate it.
[03:11:14.705 --> 03:11:15.666]  They are pissed off.
[03:11:15.726 --> 03:11:19.489]  Now they're calling him a racist, a Nazi, every name.
[03:11:19.509 --> 03:11:20.730]  They're just going to keep coming at him.
[03:11:20.750 --> 03:11:22.812]  We've got foreign diplomats saying they don't like him.
[03:11:23.072 --> 03:11:24.633]  And I think all that is good.
[03:11:25.054 --> 03:11:28.937]  The more people hate Donald Trump, the more I'm really beginning to like him.
[03:11:29.157 --> 03:11:34.121]  So let's go to that report now, and then I'll go over some of these articles that I have talking about this.
[03:11:34.221 --> 03:11:34.862]  All right, let's roll it.
[03:11:35.990 --> 03:11:37.592]  The BLM is back in the news again.
[03:11:37.893 --> 03:11:48.808]  This time we hear from a sheriff in Utah who said he'll deputize the entire county, every man, woman, and child if he has to, in order to defend the land rights of local citizens from an occupying federal army.
[03:11:48.828 --> 03:11:50.971]  Did you hear the phrase posse comitatus?
[03:11:52.603 --> 03:12:01.847]  And typically we think of the Posse Comitatus Act, which is an act that limits the power of the federal government to use the federal military to enact domestic policy.
[03:12:01.967 --> 03:12:02.527]  Think about that.
[03:12:03.007 --> 03:12:08.370]  We don't want a military coming into our communities.
[03:12:08.970 --> 03:12:10.110]  We don't want soldiers.
[03:12:10.150 --> 03:12:11.651]  We don't want martial law.
[03:12:11.791 --> 03:12:14.792]  Okay, that's why we have the Posse Comitatus Act.
[03:12:15.653 --> 03:12:17.854]  But what does Posse Comitatus really mean?
[03:12:17.914 --> 03:12:20.715]  It literally means the power of the county.
[03:12:22.162 --> 03:12:25.244]  The sheriff of the county would call a posse.
[03:12:25.264 --> 03:12:26.685]  We've all seen the westerns, right?
[03:12:27.366 --> 03:12:44.237]  You have the sheriff who was elected, not appointed by some kind of law enforcement bureaucracy, not appointed by some distant federal government that is as far distant geographically as the British government was geographically from the American colonies at the time of the Revolutionary War.
[03:12:45.180 --> 03:12:50.566]  So law enforcement was centered around one elected official and some of his permanent deputies.
[03:12:51.066 --> 03:12:58.975]  But when something big would happen, they would deputize people and they would create a posse to keep the peace in the county.
[03:12:59.395 --> 03:13:00.917]  We're not taking no more cats on the mountain.
[03:13:02.117 --> 03:13:05.802]  I'll deputize every man, woman, and child in that county to stop what's going on.
[03:13:06.082 --> 03:13:14.412]  So how did we get to the situation where the federal government is bullying local citizens to the point where a sheriff has to threaten to deputize the entire county?
[03:13:14.933 --> 03:13:17.576]  As a recent article from High County News has pointed out.
[03:13:17.836 --> 03:13:22.978]  This is a result of an arms race by the BLM, an arms race on the range.
[03:13:23.519 --> 03:13:26.700]  Until 1978, there were no badged BLM agents.
[03:13:27.320 --> 03:13:28.421]  At first, there were only 13.
[03:13:29.501 --> 03:13:33.443]  They modeled themselves after Park Service Rangers and carried only pistols.
[03:13:33.903 --> 03:13:41.251]  Two years earlier, there had been a Federal Land Policy Management Act of 1976 that granted law enforcement authority to the agency.
[03:13:41.572 --> 03:13:45.957]  But it also emphasized that they rely upon local law enforcement.
[03:13:46.197 --> 03:13:48.420]  And at first, they cooperated with county sheriffs.
[03:13:48.920 --> 03:13:52.625]  But within just a few years, they were seeing heavily armed agents.
[03:13:53.246 --> 03:13:58.612]  Chris Hartman, who was hired as a ranger in 1984, recalls a series of controversial equipment upgrades.
[03:13:58.913 --> 03:14:04.980]  Shotguns in the 80s, semi-automatic rifles in 1992, high-powered assault rifles in the early 2000s.
[03:14:05.320 --> 03:14:07.223]  Then she left the BLM for the Forest Service.
[03:14:07.443 --> 03:14:09.945]  And she saw the same pattern happening there.
[03:14:10.125 --> 03:14:13.548]  But she said, still, the sheriffs were ahead of us in terms of weaponry.
[03:14:13.989 --> 03:14:18.132]  Is this some kind of an arms race between local law enforcement and federal agents?
[03:14:18.593 --> 03:14:21.175]  In 1996 alone, at least 2,439 new federal cops were authorized to carry firearms.
[03:14:28.061 --> 03:14:29.902]  That takes the total up to nearly 60,000.
[03:14:31.582 --> 03:14:39.245]  Farah points out that these cops were not only in agencies like the FBI, but include the EPA, the U.S.
[03:14:39.305 --> 03:14:42.306]  Fish and Wildlife, the Army Corps of Engineers.
[03:14:43.086 --> 03:14:48.408]  Even Bruce Babbitt, according to Farah, wants to arm the Bureau of Land Management.
[03:14:48.688 --> 03:14:55.371]  Farah logically asks, when will the NEA have its armed art cops?
[03:14:56.072 --> 03:15:05.234]  We have to understand that whenever the federal government starts arming itself with high-powered military equipment, they are turning themselves into a standing army.
[03:15:05.374 --> 03:15:08.135]  And they will use this against the citizens.
[03:15:08.675 --> 03:15:12.256]  As elsewhere in law enforcement, 9-11 changed things.
[03:15:12.336 --> 03:15:13.656]  It created a restructuring.
[03:15:13.876 --> 03:15:18.857]  Former BLM director Bob Abbey said it created a faction within the agency.
[03:15:19.037 --> 03:15:22.758]  And he said, I think in many respects they have become a separate organization.
[03:15:23.078 --> 03:15:27.740]  So-called special agents in charge were given autonomy over large regions.
[03:15:28.180 --> 03:15:33.423]  The most controversial of these special agents has been Dan Love, special agent for Utah and Nevada.
[03:15:33.763 --> 03:15:38.545]  He was a special agent in charge at the Bundy standoff, but he was controversial long before that.
[03:15:38.945 --> 03:15:44.966]  His first controversy involved illegal artifact trading in southeast Utah, going back to 2009.
[03:15:45.386 --> 03:15:54.348]  In that case, a doctor who was very beloved to the small community that he served, was accused of taking an Indian artifact from the land that the federal government claims belongs to them.
[03:15:54.588 --> 03:15:58.009]  The item in question was a bead, less than half the size of a dime.
[03:15:58.209 --> 03:16:06.111]  The wrongful death complaint by the doctor's family said the BLM agent, Love, had doubled the value of the item so the charge would rise to that of a felony.
[03:16:06.331 --> 03:16:11.574]  And they also said this was retaliation for dismissal of similar charges more than a decade earlier.
[03:16:11.914 --> 03:16:16.097]  In Utah, the doctor had been accused by a confidential federal informant.
[03:16:16.297 --> 03:16:21.480]  The 60-year-old doctor was swarmed by between 80 and 100 agents in full military array.
[03:16:21.640 --> 03:16:23.121]  Flak jackets, assault weapons.
[03:16:23.321 --> 03:16:28.364]  He was manhandled, handcuffed, as he returned home from serving in the community health clinic that he ran.
[03:16:28.624 --> 03:16:31.966]  He was taken to his garage, interrogated for four hours like a terrorist.
[03:16:32.267 --> 03:16:34.268]  He was told that he would lose his medical license.
[03:16:34.648 --> 03:16:38.110]  And Agent Love accused him of using garden tools to dig up bodies.
[03:16:38.610 --> 03:16:42.151]  The doctor was so distraught by these charges that he committed suicide.
[03:16:42.492 --> 03:16:45.833]  The family brought a wrongful death lawsuit against the BLM.
[03:16:45.973 --> 03:16:49.495]  The BLM argued that agents have qualified immunity.
[03:16:50.035 --> 03:17:02.621]  And a judge eventually dismissed the case saying, the agent's mere presence and proximity to Dr. Red did not create an excessive show of force, even if the agents wore SWAT gear and carried, but did not point, machine guns.
[03:17:02.901 --> 03:17:16.216]  Yet the basis for the charges against Cliven Bundy regarding the Bunkerville standoff are that he incited people to carry firearms legally and that the brandishing of firearms alone was a felony threat to federal officers.
[03:17:17.031 --> 03:17:19.794]  So what we have here are a set of two different rules.
[03:17:19.934 --> 03:17:24.318]  One set for protesters, a completely different set for federal officers.
[03:17:24.839 --> 03:17:26.160]  The hallmark of tyranny.
[03:17:26.500 --> 03:17:34.348]  But as we're reminded with the recent indictment of Cliven Bundy, special agent in charge, Dan Love, was the center of the Bunkerville standoff.
[03:17:34.488 --> 03:17:37.311]  Now even the Clark County Sheriff, Doug Gillespie,
[03:17:37.651 --> 03:17:46.234]  Friend of Harry Reid said in interviews with Las Vegas newspapers at the beginning of February that the BLM had lied to him about circumstances of the cattle roundup.
[03:17:46.534 --> 03:18:04.680]  Another BLM special agent in charge, Steve Martin, who serves in a different jurisdiction, recalls sitting in the briefing room of Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, listening to the details of a clandestine operation that his agency was planning in the Nevada desert, which would eventually become the Cliven Bundy cattle operation.
[03:18:05.180 --> 03:18:08.983]  He characterized the plan as unduly optimistic bravado.
[03:18:09.464 --> 03:18:13.147]  And he said, I remember thinking, is this still the BLM?
[03:18:13.648 --> 03:18:16.210]  He said, we know there are a lot of people out there who don't like us.
[03:18:16.670 --> 03:18:26.118]  And he believes things would not have come to the kind of head that they did if the BLM had worked with and through the local sheriff instead of lying to him about what was going on.
[03:18:26.679 --> 03:18:27.159]  But they didn't.
[03:18:27.340 --> 03:18:29.802]  They acted confrontationally, high-handed.
[03:18:30.282 --> 03:18:36.309]  And now, after two years, they have made good on their vendetta and arrested Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy.
[03:18:36.609 --> 03:18:40.914]  Garfield County Sheriff Danny Perkins has said, we have absolutely no relationship with the BLM.
[03:18:41.255 --> 03:18:41.775]  We've tried.
[03:18:41.855 --> 03:18:43.437]  They seem to want to do their own things.
[03:18:43.477 --> 03:18:45.900]  They do not respect the authority of the sheriff at all.
[03:18:46.280 --> 03:18:47.101]  Another county sheriff.
[03:18:47.742 --> 03:18:53.824]  Rick Eldridge says that Rangers pull over citizens without probable cause, even in areas where they have no jurisdiction.
[03:18:53.984 --> 03:18:54.964]  They bully ranch hands.
[03:18:55.064 --> 03:18:58.085]  They berate tourists for parking vehicles off dirt roads.
[03:18:58.586 --> 03:19:00.386]  And they illegally close roads.
[03:19:00.726 --> 03:19:03.267]  Federal officers refuse to help with search and rescue.
[03:19:03.447 --> 03:19:05.428]  When they do, they get in the way, he says.
[03:19:05.708 --> 03:19:11.890]  So this is what brings us to the point where Paiute County Sheriff Marty Gleave says we're not taking it anymore.
[03:19:12.330 --> 03:19:17.537]  I'll deputize every man, woman, and child in the county to stop what's going on.
[03:19:18.238 --> 03:19:21.783]  I'll deputize every man, woman, and child in that county to stop what's going on.
[03:19:26.391 --> 03:19:26.772]  I don't know.
[03:19:42.935 --> 03:19:48.499]  I'm going to take some phone calls coming up in the next segment.
[03:19:48.519 --> 03:19:48.799]  800-259-9231.
[03:19:48.819 --> 03:19:49.640]  800-259-9231.
[03:19:49.700 --> 03:19:50.381]  Call in now.
[03:19:50.701 --> 03:19:51.461]  Let's talk about this.
[03:19:51.501 --> 03:19:57.946]  So far, 19 people have been arrested, rounded up, essentially, in six different states, as we're reporting on InfoWars.com.
[03:19:58.367 --> 03:19:58.747]  For what?
[03:19:59.047 --> 03:20:00.088]  Standing up for themselves?
[03:20:00.268 --> 03:20:00.728]  We'll be back.
[03:20:11.069 --> 03:20:21.674]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:20:21.974 --> 03:20:25.875]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[03:20:26.136 --> 03:20:27.956]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:28.297 --> 03:20:33.739]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:33.919 --> 03:20:43.707]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:20:43.947 --> 03:20:50.213]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:20:50.453 --> 03:20:53.756]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:20:53.776 --> 03:20:55.617]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:20:55.858 --> 03:20:58.780]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:20:58.960 --> 03:21:01.103]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[03:21:40.171 --> 03:21:42.913]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[03:21:43.233 --> 03:21:45.834]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[03:21:45.874 --> 03:21:46.295]  Croix River.
[03:21:46.615 --> 03:21:48.616]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[03:21:48.836 --> 03:21:51.558]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[03:21:51.798 --> 03:21:52.318]  His excuse?
[03:21:52.679 --> 03:21:53.739]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[03:21:54.019 --> 03:21:55.300]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[03:21:55.620 --> 03:22:01.124]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[03:23:20.591 --> 03:23:23.352]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:23:24.192 --> 03:23:27.873]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:23:28.533 --> 03:23:29.774]  I said, let me see.
[03:23:30.354 --> 03:23:40.942]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:23:41.443 --> 03:23:52.571]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[03:23:53.499 --> 03:23:54.200]  How about you?
[03:23:54.520 --> 03:23:55.822]  For your free quote, call 1-800-654-1632.
[03:23:55.842 --> 03:23:56.142]  That's 1-800-654-1632.
[03:23:56.162 --> 03:23:56.222]  1-800-654-1632.
[03:23:56.262 --> 03:23:57.083]  Or go to selectquote.com.
[03:23:57.103 --> 03:23:57.383]  We shop.
[03:23:57.503 --> 03:23:57.683]  You save.
[03:24:28.413 --> 03:24:41.046]  I truly believe this is showing the federal government thinks they have unlimited power over the people.
[03:24:41.926 --> 03:24:43.128]  What kind of government do we have?
[03:24:43.168 --> 03:24:47.852]  Those are the words of Carol Bundy after her husband and sons were arrested.
[03:24:49.398 --> 03:24:57.863]  And others have been arrested for basically sticking up for a landowner and his rights to graze his cattle over this overreaching BLM.
[03:24:58.123 --> 03:25:01.826]  And if you just listen to the report that David Knight or watch it at Inforrest.com forward slash show.
[03:25:03.240 --> 03:25:05.421]  You can see why people are upset, especially out west.
[03:25:05.842 --> 03:25:11.045]  Now, you live in a big city, you may not understand how it works out if you own a ranch.
[03:25:11.665 --> 03:25:16.108]  There's a lot of land, sometimes the borders, you don't know where they end, where they begin.
[03:25:16.128 --> 03:25:23.052]  People have been using this for a long time, then you have the federal government suddenly showing up with machine guns going, get out of here.
[03:25:23.873 --> 03:25:24.673]  This is our land.
[03:25:24.933 --> 03:25:27.515]  And they're not doing anything to protect it, they're not doing anything to save it.
[03:25:29.556 --> 03:25:31.077]  Yeah, let's look at this tweet.
[03:25:31.177 --> 03:25:32.558]  Here's an event coming up in Berkeley.
[03:25:33.993 --> 03:25:36.254]  Health Communication Matters webinar series.
[03:25:36.554 --> 03:25:38.775]  I was going to talk about that in a second, but I just tweeted it out.
[03:25:39.956 --> 03:25:43.358]  Shifting the narrative, the role of social media in public health communications.
[03:25:43.838 --> 03:25:47.420]  Yeah, these people are pissed off because people are sharing information on the Internet.
[03:25:47.440 --> 03:25:50.301]  It's Thursday, March 10th, from 11 a.m.
[03:25:50.341 --> 03:25:51.022]  to 2 p.m.
[03:25:51.062 --> 03:25:51.582]  Pacific.
[03:25:53.803 --> 03:25:54.123]  Let me read.
[03:25:54.143 --> 03:25:55.604]  I'm going to bring this over here so I can read it.
[03:25:56.545 --> 03:25:59.066]  Social media has made an increasingly important communication channel.
[03:26:01.539 --> 03:26:06.941]  Let's see, but authoritative voices of public health officials and physicians are missing or hard to find.
[03:26:09.601 --> 03:26:25.086]  Then Renee, who is this Dr. Renee Disrata, co-founder of the Vaccinate California, a vaccine pusher, will take us into a deeper dive and discuss a discourse surrounding vaccines and how despite being the minority, anti-vax groups have been leveraging social media.
[03:26:25.888 --> 03:26:31.490]  Renee's opposition research can help form public health community experts to better understand the tactics of the opposition.
[03:26:31.970 --> 03:26:37.752]  Well, I think everybody should go down to this and tell these people they need to stop lying to people.
[03:26:37.772 --> 03:26:41.413]  This is a group that Hillary Clinton basically lied about.
[03:26:41.473 --> 03:26:44.314]  She said the gun manufacturers are the only ones that have absolute immunity.
[03:26:44.654 --> 03:26:46.515]  No, the vaccine makers have absolute immunity.
[03:26:47.235 --> 03:26:53.297]  If your kid gets vaccine damaged, you have to go to a special court where the vaccine manufacturers don't even have to
[03:26:53.877 --> 03:26:55.058]  Present evidence at all.
[03:26:55.458 --> 03:26:57.639]  You have to prove your case beyond a shadow of a doubt.
[03:26:59.099 --> 03:26:59.660]  It's stacked.
[03:26:59.680 --> 03:27:01.040]  The deck is stacked against them.
[03:27:01.441 --> 03:27:05.462]  And here's just a few articles on the Wall Street Journal.
[03:27:05.963 --> 03:27:08.184]  Vaccine makers enjoy immunity.
[03:27:08.204 --> 03:27:18.508]  One of the little-noticed reasons that Wyeth was attractive enough to command a $68 billion price from rival Pfizer is his planned
[03:27:21.092 --> 03:27:24.054]  This started in the 80s because people were suing the vaccine makers because their children were getting hurt.
[03:27:24.074 --> 03:27:24.554]  It started in 1986.
[03:27:24.614 --> 03:27:26.095]  And I think it was President Reagan at the time.
[03:27:44.946 --> 03:27:47.108]  That went up under his administration.
[03:27:47.388 --> 03:27:56.916]  Coincidentally enough, Nancy Reagan died over the weekend on Sunday, and Alex, coming up at the bottom of the hour, we're going to have a report from Alex Jones talking about that.
[03:27:57.176 --> 03:27:58.377]  But let's go to your calls right now.
[03:27:58.437 --> 03:28:02.080]  Jim in West Virginia wants to talk about the BLM property maintenance code.
[03:28:02.541 --> 03:28:03.341]  Jim, what's on your mind?
[03:28:04.142 --> 03:28:05.443]  Okay, listen very carefully.
[03:28:06.043 --> 03:28:08.966]  I have reason to believe that more property is being stolen with the International
[03:28:09.864 --> 03:28:10.364]  I think so.
[03:28:25.581 --> 03:28:27.322]  Hey Jim, have you had dealings with these people?
[03:28:27.382 --> 03:28:27.702]  Absolutely!
[03:28:51.949 --> 03:28:54.270]  But anyway, for whatever reason, just look it up.
[03:28:54.770 --> 03:28:56.930]  I did a show with Gary Brownfield July 14, 2006.
[03:28:57.711 --> 03:29:00.372]  I did one with the Power Hour in 2009.
[03:29:00.912 --> 03:29:01.912]  It gets no traction.
[03:29:02.212 --> 03:29:05.733]  Now, fines can range for hundreds of dollars a day, and I'm a nervous wreck.
[03:29:05.773 --> 03:29:08.334]  I'm sorry, because I've gone through hell ever since I publicized it.
[03:29:09.274 --> 03:29:09.674]  I think so.
[03:29:29.773 --> 03:29:34.118]  Now, for whatever reasons, there's no insurance cut I know of which will compensate you for your losses.
[03:29:34.918 --> 03:29:35.839]  Now, here's the deal.
[03:29:35.920 --> 03:29:37.721]  It's statewide in Texas, West Virginia.
[03:29:37.741 --> 03:29:41.005]  I think West Virginia was the first state they opened up statewide in.
[03:29:41.545 --> 03:29:42.366]  But just look it up.
[03:29:42.466 --> 03:29:45.289]  Some places they've opened up a city at a time, like Ohio.
[03:29:46.250 --> 03:29:48.753]  Okay, and it's been a magnet for all kinds of corruption.
[03:29:49.592 --> 03:29:51.353]  I've been a magnet for these stories.
[03:29:51.373 --> 03:29:52.254]  People track me down.
[03:29:52.734 --> 03:29:57.257]  But for whatever reasons, triple W-I-C-C-S-A-F-E... Jim, stay there.
[03:29:57.277 --> 03:29:59.979]  I'm going to let you finish up after the break, and we'll be right back.
[03:30:00.019 --> 03:30:00.899]  We're on the march.
[03:30:01.380 --> 03:30:02.981]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.901 --> 03:30:06.603]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.540 --> 03:30:14.543]  Donald Trump is shaking up the world order, and that's something we've needed for a very long time.
[03:30:14.803 --> 03:30:17.364]  For one thing, foreign diplomats are expressing alarm to U.S.
[03:30:17.404 --> 03:30:23.288]  government officials about what they claim are inflammatory and insulting public statements by Trump, according to senior U.S.
[03:30:23.348 --> 03:30:23.769]  officials.
[03:30:24.069 --> 03:30:28.932]  Officials from Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia have complained to recent private conversations about Trump's statements.
[03:30:29.272 --> 03:30:29.412]  U.S.
[03:30:29.492 --> 03:30:36.256]  officials said it was highly unusual for foreign diplomats to express concern, even privately, about candidates in the midst of a presidential campaign.
[03:30:36.556 --> 03:30:41.518]  Because they don't want to be seen as meddling in domestic politics, considering that they will have to work with whoever wins.
[03:30:41.818 --> 03:30:49.142]  Additionally, senior leaders in several countries, including Britain, Mexico, France, and Canada, have already made public comments criticizing Trump's positions.
[03:30:49.502 --> 03:30:50.383]  And that's a good thing.
[03:30:50.583 --> 03:30:54.185]  America needs to quit catering to foreign politicians who want to destroy U.S.
[03:30:54.225 --> 03:30:55.065]  national sovereignty.
[03:30:55.205 --> 03:30:58.987]  And America needs to be more concerned about the needs of the American citizen first, before a foreign diplomat.
[03:30:59.127 --> 03:31:06.571]  There's way too many Americans out there living from paycheck to paycheck to worry about what a bunch of crybaby foreign diplomats say during their fancy lobster dinners paid for by taxpayers.
[03:31:06.911 --> 03:31:09.993]  This is Kit Daniels reporting for InfoWurst.com.
[03:31:10.333 --> 03:31:12.314]  BrainForce, it's completely different.
[03:31:12.414 --> 03:31:13.455]  Try a bottle of it.
[03:31:13.655 --> 03:31:15.096]  Rob Dew joins us.
[03:31:15.236 --> 03:31:18.057]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[03:31:18.358 --> 03:31:19.378]  Tell us what BrainForce did.
[03:31:19.418 --> 03:31:20.359]  I've been working all day.
[03:31:20.379 --> 03:31:22.740]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:31:22.880 --> 03:31:23.881]  I get in here at 830.
[03:31:24.301 --> 03:31:25.942]  I was kind of run down.
[03:31:26.202 --> 03:31:27.983]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[03:31:28.123 --> 03:31:29.985]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:31:30.005 --> 03:31:31.826]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[03:31:31.846 --> 03:31:32.607]  I popped two of them.
[03:31:32.907 --> 03:31:35.049]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[03:31:35.189 --> 03:31:37.050]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[03:31:37.151 --> 03:31:38.432]  It's got four and a half stars.
[03:31:38.632 --> 03:31:39.653]  People really love it.
[03:31:39.973 --> 03:31:40.493]  Read about it.
[03:31:40.573 --> 03:31:44.316]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[03:31:44.397 --> 03:31:49.681]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[03:31:49.881 --> 03:31:53.746]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:31:53.926 --> 03:31:59.713]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[03:32:00.054 --> 03:32:05.981]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:32:10.134 --> 03:32:11.055]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[03:32:11.095 --> 03:32:11.495]  Good, brother.
[03:32:11.655 --> 03:32:13.357]  Just recently started using your products.
[03:32:13.377 --> 03:32:15.138]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:32:15.318 --> 03:32:19.341]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:32:19.362 --> 03:32:21.924]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[03:32:21.964 --> 03:32:24.185]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[03:32:24.386 --> 03:32:32.252]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[03:32:32.572 --> 03:32:35.673]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[03:32:35.813 --> 03:32:37.294]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[03:32:37.334 --> 03:32:40.255]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[03:32:40.375 --> 03:32:41.736]  Saving a ton of money there.
[03:32:42.016 --> 03:32:47.838]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated.
[03:32:48.098 --> 03:32:49.679]  Or maximum potency.
[03:32:49.879 --> 03:32:56.044]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience.
[03:32:56.344 --> 03:33:00.027]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[03:33:00.087 --> 03:33:01.828]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[03:33:01.888 --> 03:33:08.833]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from Infowarslife.
[03:33:23.459 --> 03:33:30.964]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:33:31.945 --> 03:33:35.848]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:36.308 --> 03:33:40.130]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:33:40.491 --> 03:33:42.092]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:44.749 --> 03:33:52.236]  As we went to break, we had Jim in West Virginia talking about code enforcers, which are probably some of the lowest, vilest forms of scum on this planet.
[03:33:52.836 --> 03:33:55.679]  They're not elected, but they run around on their petty power trips.
[03:33:55.739 --> 03:33:58.801]  I'm going to let him finish up on that in just one second.
[03:33:59.942 --> 03:34:03.325]  Remember the Bernie report that we played earlier about the Bernie baby dying?
[03:34:03.526 --> 03:34:06.688]  Here's just some of the articles that I put in that report.
[03:34:07.909 --> 03:34:10.532]  Could this be driving the epidemic of sudden infant death?
[03:34:11.252 --> 03:34:11.973]  Or SIDS.
[03:34:12.393 --> 03:34:13.134]  You know, it's a syndrome.
[03:34:13.154 --> 03:34:13.654]  We don't know how.
[03:34:14.074 --> 03:34:16.716]  And doctors, you read the articles, and they don't know how it happens.
[03:34:16.736 --> 03:34:18.297]  They don't know anything about this.
[03:34:18.317 --> 03:34:18.998]  They're just, uh.
[03:34:19.358 --> 03:34:19.899]  Well, here it is.
[03:34:20.299 --> 03:34:25.203]  A study published by Current Medicine and Chemistry titled, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Following Hexavalent Vaccination.
[03:34:26.448 --> 03:34:34.571]  The fact that the peak age for SIDS is two to four months, which coincides with the introduction of 11 shots containing 16 vaccines within the immunization schedule.
[03:34:35.272 --> 03:34:44.836]  So, that would be the obvious first place to look, would be at the vaccines that they're pumping into these kids at two months, two days, four months.
[03:34:45.196 --> 03:34:46.136]  Nah, we don't look there.
[03:34:46.156 --> 03:34:49.518]  Well, the vaccine lobby makes sure we don't look there.
[03:34:51.564 --> 03:34:54.367]  Here's another one from Current Chemistry.
[03:34:54.427 --> 03:34:57.869]  Sudden infant death syndrome following a hexavalent vaccination is a neuropathic study.
[03:34:57.889 --> 03:35:00.051]  It's Current Medicinal Chemistry.
[03:35:01.252 --> 03:35:05.676]  SIDS plausibly linked to vaccines in four-month-old baby boy.
[03:35:07.257 --> 03:35:09.539]  And this is very sad.
[03:35:09.599 --> 03:35:10.560]  These are all sad stories.
[03:35:10.980 --> 03:35:11.640]  Warning to parents.
[03:35:11.680 --> 03:35:13.642]  Hepatitis B vaccine linked to sudden infant death.
[03:35:13.682 --> 03:35:14.683]  It's from Mercola.com.
[03:35:16.417 --> 03:35:24.962]  So they're out there and I encourage you to do your research on vaccines before you inject your beautiful little babies out there with them.
[03:35:25.002 --> 03:35:26.103]  Do your research.
[03:35:27.404 --> 03:35:33.368]  You do not want the same path that happened to the Bernie baby to happen to your kids.
[03:35:34.434 --> 03:35:39.939]  We have a flash sale with Silver Bullet, 50% off one of my favorite products that we sell at Infowars Life.
[03:35:39.959 --> 03:35:43.942]  30 parts per million, three times stronger than most colloidal silver out there.

[03:35:45.984 --> 03:35:49.187]  It's less than $10, I believe, and $9.95.
[03:35:49.227 --> 03:35:49.627]  Look at that.
[03:35:49.947 --> 03:35:50.187]  I mean...
[03:35:50.908 --> 03:35:51.728]  This is your chance.

[03:36:00.771 --> 03:36:08.814]  You can put it topically, you can drink it, you can inhale it, snort it, depending on where your affliction lies.
[03:36:09.154 --> 03:36:09.954]  That's what I do.
[03:36:10.154 --> 03:36:12.375]  Of course, I would never give out medical advice.
[03:36:12.395 --> 03:36:13.195]  I'll just say what I do.
[03:36:13.615 --> 03:36:17.716]  This is your chance to stock up 50% off at InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:36:49.062 --> 03:36:50.683]  And without further ado, Jim, finish up.
[03:36:50.703 --> 03:36:53.646]  I'm going to go to a couple more calls and then play this Nancy Reagan report.
[03:36:53.806 --> 03:36:57.089]  Go ahead, finish up what you're saying about the BLM property maintenance code.
[03:36:57.749 --> 03:36:59.211]  Hey, I've got two more important points.
[03:36:59.331 --> 03:36:59.551]  Alright.
[03:37:00.232 --> 03:37:02.073]  One of which is that there's another spooky thing.
[03:37:02.193 --> 03:37:10.220]  It can, according to the International Property Maintenance Code, you've got all four words, it can be amended any way they like, which means they change the name in some jurisdictions.
[03:37:10.240 --> 03:37:12.742]  So, you say, do you have the International Property Maintenance Code?
[03:37:13.142 --> 03:37:13.643]  No.
[03:37:14.303 --> 03:37:15.805]  The other one is that it is a code.
[03:37:15.885 --> 03:37:16.846]  Code by definition is
[03:37:18.130 --> 03:37:19.693]  EVIDENCE OF LAW, NOT LAW.
[03:37:19.713 --> 03:37:23.501]  A CONTACT OF TWO PHD'S IN LAW WORKED WEST VIRGINIA STATE SUPREME COURT.
[03:37:24.182 --> 03:37:25.946]  HE SAID IT IS NOT PART OF WEST VIRGINIA LAW.
[03:37:26.923 --> 03:37:28.504]  International Property Maintenance Code.
[03:37:28.865 --> 03:37:40.174]  And according to my thinking is, oh, I had some official from a major city contact me and say, listen, we're not enforcing it now, but it's designed to roll out as tax revenues decrease.
[03:37:40.294 --> 03:37:40.935]  Exactly.
[03:37:41.375 --> 03:37:41.796]  Exactly.
[03:37:41.856 --> 03:37:44.678]  As the economy falters, they're going to look for more low-hanging fruit.
[03:37:45.098 --> 03:37:45.999]  Could be your property.
[03:37:46.299 --> 03:37:47.741]  Could be anybody's property out there.
[03:37:47.801 --> 03:37:49.442]  Jim, you've got a great radio voice.
[03:37:49.482 --> 03:37:54.306]  You should do a couple segments on International Property Maintenance Codes on YouTube and send them to us.
[03:37:54.346 --> 03:37:54.867]  We'll play them.
[03:37:55.407 --> 03:37:58.750]  I don't know all the legal... This stuff, when I start looking at it, it just makes my head spin.
[03:37:58.810 --> 03:38:01.131]  It's just so... It's written to confuse you.
[03:38:01.191 --> 03:38:05.514]  It's written for regular people to just go, ugh, I don't even want to deal with it.
[03:38:05.855 --> 03:38:07.796]  And then you have one of these code enforcers coming to your door.
[03:38:08.076 --> 03:38:10.318]  Jack in Canada wants to talk about BLM on the border.
[03:38:11.259 --> 03:38:12.039]  What's on your mind, Jack?
[03:38:13.100 --> 03:38:22.246]  Well, you know, about a year ago I was just riding down close to the border near Coal Creek Road there, just east of West Pond.
[03:38:24.992 --> 03:38:26.393]  Just south of Borderland.
[03:38:26.413 --> 03:38:46.910]  I'm just right along the border and I notice these guys in these white trucks up on the road there and it just meets right up on the border and I got up close to say hi, hello, you know, just being neighborly like and it wasn't Border Patrol but was some other agency had a, I think it was a Triangle
[03:38:47.882 --> 03:38:51.305]  Uh, with green on it and, but they were real nasty.
[03:38:51.365 --> 03:38:52.926]  Oh, don't you be crossing the border now.
[03:38:53.026 --> 03:38:55.608]  And we got our eye on you and blah, blah, blah.
[03:38:55.728 --> 03:38:56.869]  And I'm like, are you kidding me?
[03:38:58.152 --> 03:38:59.353]  I can't.
[03:38:59.453 --> 03:39:00.253]  Yeah, you're guilty.
[03:39:00.393 --> 03:39:01.994]  You're guilty until proven innocent.
[03:39:02.014 --> 03:39:03.795]  That's how these these guys are.
[03:39:03.855 --> 03:39:06.757]  They really think they're above the law in any way shape or form.
[03:39:07.618 --> 03:39:10.539]  And hey, I got Tim in Wyoming and Carmen in New Jersey.
[03:39:10.579 --> 03:39:11.840]  You guys hang on.
[03:39:11.860 --> 03:39:13.281]  I'm gonna get you in that last segment.
[03:39:13.301 --> 03:39:14.542]  We got a five-minute segment at the end.
[03:39:14.562 --> 03:39:16.283]  We're gonna go this report now.
[03:39:16.363 --> 03:39:18.484]  Alex Jones talking about the death of Nancy Reagan.
[03:39:19.484 --> 03:39:23.387]  Yesterday, on Sunday the 6th of March 2016,
[03:39:26.937 --> 03:39:31.299]  Former First Lady Nancy Reagan died of congestive heart failure.
[03:39:33.179 --> 03:39:46.164]  And I remember growing up and being politically aware in the 1980s and seeing the abject hatred on television in Hollywood and by the so-called left against Ronald Reagan.
[03:39:48.085 --> 03:39:51.406]  But the real hatred was reserved for Nancy.
[03:39:52.827 --> 03:39:57.429]  Then in high school, I remember, even well after he was out of office, people that hated him so much.
[03:39:58.309 --> 03:40:05.372]  And in college, the things they would say and do about Nancy Reagan and about Ronald Reagan.
[03:40:06.953 --> 03:40:13.676]  You would think funding the anti-communist Contras was equivalent to the Holocaust.
[03:40:14.216 --> 03:40:20.459]  And certainly some bad things were done by the right wing in response to the Contras, who also engaged in incredible atrocities.
[03:40:21.664 --> 03:40:37.191]  But what I was getting at is the crimes committed by some of the brass, the Pentagon, and the rest of them, attributed to Ronald Reagan, when you compare them to what Obama and the Bushes and others and the Clintons have done, is nothing.
[03:40:38.356 --> 03:40:40.857]  But now we're just desensitized and don't care.
[03:40:41.497 --> 03:40:57.484]  But the way the press attacked Nancy Reagan, the way they would trot out adopted children and others, who the left had basically co-opted and who they would give book deals to, to demonize them was just so crazy, I couldn't ever find the substance.
[03:40:59.064 --> 03:41:04.447]  The reason they hated Ronald Reagan was the fact that he was a strong male role model,
[03:41:05.464 --> 03:41:06.748]  He was a nationalist.
[03:41:07.670 --> 03:41:09.816]  He believed in and loved Americana.
[03:41:12.728 --> 03:41:23.013]  And the establishment had tried to block him from getting the nomination and had tried to put George Herbert Walker Bush, the former director of the CIA, in place.
[03:41:23.713 --> 03:41:37.580]  And it's famous that at the Republican convention in 1980, they threatened to have a broker convention like they're doing now with Trump, and that they wouldn't let him even have the presidency or the nomination for the Republican Party if they didn't put George Herbert Walker Bush in place.
[03:41:38.632 --> 03:41:41.273]  And I've talked to Reagan confidants on and off air.
[03:41:41.293 --> 03:41:48.257]  Reagan was not completely all there after he got shot less than a year in office.
[03:41:48.817 --> 03:41:55.581]  A videotape of an incident that took place less than 15 minutes ago at the Washington Hilton Hotel when shots were fired at President Reagan.
[03:41:55.601 --> 03:41:57.022]  Here you see the president coming out now.
[03:41:57.042 --> 03:41:58.122]  You just have to watch.
[03:41:58.963 --> 03:42:03.605]  I don't know if you can hear this or not.
[03:42:06.164 --> 03:42:06.745]  Get him out!
[03:42:06.805 --> 03:42:07.245]  Get him out!
[03:42:07.265 --> 03:42:07.886]  Get him out!
[03:42:07.906 --> 03:42:09.007]  Get him out!
[03:42:09.047 --> 03:42:09.708]  Get him out!
[03:42:09.768 --> 03:42:10.528]  Get him out!
[03:42:10.548 --> 03:42:11.069]  Get him out!
[03:42:11.089 --> 03:42:12.070]  Get him out!
[03:42:12.090 --> 03:42:13.732]  Get him out!
[03:42:14.332 --> 03:42:14.652]  Get him out!
[03:42:29.107 --> 03:42:30.087]  He was sharp before.
[03:42:30.807 --> 03:42:36.608]  He reportedly was given a dose of, quote, cold blood, that when you're given that, basically causes a stroke.
[03:42:38.949 --> 03:42:44.750]  And from that point on, he became a semi-puppet of the Bushes.
[03:42:45.710 --> 03:42:55.812]  Now, I'm digressing here, but the shooter that shot Ronald Reagan, on record, reportedly, according to the Denver Post and other publications, had dinner days before
[03:42:57.492 --> 03:42:59.233]  With members of the Bush family.
[03:43:01.114 --> 03:43:11.558]  With some of the sons of the vice president at the time, George Herbert Walker, skull and bones, CIA, Kennedy assassination, Bush.
[03:43:13.259 --> 03:43:18.481]  And so anyone who wants to look further into this can simply go out and do their own research.
[03:43:18.561 --> 03:43:23.263]  But the reason it's interesting is it reminded me of how much Nancy Reagan
[03:43:24.577 --> 03:43:27.718]  Hated the Bushes, especially after Reagan was shot.
[03:43:28.119 --> 03:43:38.463]  Reportedly, she wouldn't even talk to him unless it was a public function, did not want them seated near them at state functions, and absolutely hated their guts.
[03:43:39.003 --> 03:43:51.989]  And you can just type in Nancy Reagan hated the Bushes, and that's when the real demonization started against Nancy Reagan and against Reagan in the media was to discredit them in case they had to move against her.
[03:43:53.200 --> 03:43:58.212]  And that's why they started calling her paranoid, mean, hateful, crazy, was because she knew what was going on.
[03:43:58.232 --> 03:43:59.235]  In fact, here's just one article.
[03:43:59.295 --> 03:43:59.896]  Hundreds come up.
[03:44:00.237 --> 03:44:00.739]  Daily Mail.
[03:44:01.693 --> 03:44:11.041]  Nancy Reagan was jealous of Barbara Bush, thought she and Ronnie were the stars of the White House, and wanted the Bushes to know their place.
[03:44:11.562 --> 03:44:13.623]  Biography of H.W.
[03:44:13.664 --> 03:44:14.004]  reveals.
[03:44:14.524 --> 03:44:15.605]  Now see, that's their spin.
[03:44:15.785 --> 03:44:17.147]  Oh, they were the stars?
[03:44:17.187 --> 03:44:18.268]  Well, they were the ones elected.
[03:44:18.808 --> 03:44:22.031]  Your husband, who ran for Vice President four or five times, couldn't get elected.
[03:44:22.091 --> 03:44:22.691]  Dog catcher.
[03:44:23.132 --> 03:44:25.314]  And so they had to force him in there.
[03:44:26.758 --> 03:44:26.958]  I don't
[03:44:42.591 --> 03:44:44.292]  But just spin it.
[03:44:44.312 --> 03:44:45.492]  Oh, she didn't want to talk to us.
[03:44:45.572 --> 03:44:46.452]  She didn't like us.
[03:44:46.492 --> 03:44:47.473]  She didn't want to be near us.
[03:44:47.813 --> 03:44:49.714]  Because she said, we're the stars.
[03:44:50.494 --> 03:44:52.214]  No, I've read the biographies.
[03:44:52.294 --> 03:44:54.895]  I've read countless articles in my 20 plus years on air.
[03:44:55.656 --> 03:44:59.037]  She knew you were a pack of scum.
[03:45:00.877 --> 03:45:02.678]  And she knew what you did to her husband.
[03:45:02.698 --> 03:45:05.399]  So the question was, did Nancy Reagan know?
[03:45:06.339 --> 03:45:10.821]  Or did Nancy Reagan think that the Bushes had Reagan shot?
[03:45:12.560 --> 03:45:18.184]  And the answer is, of course, ladies and gentlemen, if you read the full literature, yes, she loathed them.
[03:45:18.924 --> 03:45:24.228]  More information is turning up tonight about John W. Hinckley Jr., the man accused of firing the shots.
[03:45:24.328 --> 03:45:27.030]  He was arraigned in court in Washington, D.C.
[03:45:27.070 --> 03:45:27.430]  tonight.
[03:45:27.530 --> 03:45:31.513]  There is no evidence that there was anyone else in conspiracy with Hinckley.
[03:45:32.253 --> 03:45:34.595]  It all appears as though he was acting alone.
[03:45:35.155 --> 03:45:37.016]  So just who is John Hinckley Jr.?
[03:45:37.477 --> 03:45:39.218]  We have reports beginning with Charles Murphy.
[03:45:41.463 --> 03:45:44.765]  Highland Park is one of the richest suburban towns in America.
[03:45:45.205 --> 03:45:49.648]  John Hinckley and his family lived in a house that would sell today for around $300,000.
[03:45:49.768 --> 03:45:55.251]  Hinckley is barely remembered at Highland Park High School, where he graduated in 1973.
[03:45:56.172 --> 03:46:05.177]  This donut shop near the motel was visited by Hinckley, who reportedly waited for a phone call here each day, even though he had a phone in his motel room.
[03:46:05.597 --> 03:46:07.338]  The nature of the calls is not known.
[03:46:07.878 --> 03:46:08.699]  A touch of irony.
[03:46:09.346 --> 03:46:14.308]  The young man walking with the elder Hinckley is 30-year-old Scott Hinckley, John Jr.'
[03:46:14.267 --> 03:46:14.688]  's brother.
[03:46:15.428 --> 03:46:18.709]  He and Vice President Bush's son, Neil, are friends.
[03:46:19.109 --> 03:46:21.710]  They had planned to have dinner together in Denver tonight.
[03:46:22.450 --> 03:46:24.010]  The plans have been canceled.
[03:46:24.591 --> 03:46:32.773]  So now you know why Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan were so loved, but more Nancy after Reagan was under control.
[03:46:34.654 --> 03:46:35.794]  You see, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:46:36.914 --> 03:46:41.257]  If you look deeper into this, Reagan was reading John Birch Society material.
[03:46:42.218 --> 03:46:44.920]  Reagan was learning about the New World Order.
[03:46:44.940 --> 03:46:52.405]  He was meeting with Lenin and LaRouche as well, getting that other perspective on high-tech cultures and societies and how to really have an explosive economy.
[03:46:52.825 --> 03:46:53.706]  He was a maverick.
[03:46:53.766 --> 03:46:54.526]  He was real.
[03:46:54.606 --> 03:46:55.587]  He cared about the country.
[03:46:55.847 --> 03:46:56.708]  He wasn't perfect.
[03:46:56.768 --> 03:46:59.550]  He did some bad things that he thought to fight communism.
[03:47:01.091 --> 03:47:01.972]  He gave speeches.
[03:47:01.992 --> 03:47:06.335]  There's even newscasts where he talked about
[03:47:07.520 --> 03:47:12.828]  The fact that, hey, he's trilateral commission, he wants global government, exactly what Barry Goldwater warned of.
[03:47:13.589 --> 03:47:14.771]  Bush is a part of that.
[03:47:15.151 --> 03:47:16.533]  He's a part of the CFR.
[03:47:17.374 --> 03:47:18.676]  They want to end our sovereignty.
[03:47:18.897 --> 03:47:21.500]  Well, back then people weren't as informed as they are now.
[03:47:21.560 --> 03:47:22.241]  Now we know about
[03:47:23.393 --> 03:47:27.775]  All these different globalists calling for world government, the Pope calling for it, it's out in the open.
[03:47:28.175 --> 03:47:38.781]  And that's why they were so scared of Reagan, because he wasn't going along with the treaties, he wasn't going along with the gun control, he wasn't going along with open borders until they shot him, he wasn't going along with the agenda.
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:46.362]  And so I asked myself when I got up Sunday morning and saw the sad news that Nancy Reagan had passed.
[03:47:46.402 --> 03:47:49.803]  I went to Infowars.com at about 6.30 in the morning and saw the story up there.
[03:47:50.723 --> 03:47:52.904]  And I thought, why am I sad for her now?
[03:47:53.964 --> 03:48:01.366]  But even when I was at the RNC in 2004, I was kind of turning my nose up at her when she was grandstanding about her dead husband.
[03:48:02.486 --> 03:48:03.507]  But she wasn't grandstanding.
[03:48:03.527 --> 03:48:05.587]  So I want to apologize to Nancy Reagan.
[03:48:06.127 --> 03:48:07.648]  I want to apologize to Ronald Reagan.
[03:48:08.800 --> 03:48:14.583]  When they lionized him at the RNC because those were the corrupt globalists trying to use his good name for their own selves.
[03:48:14.903 --> 03:48:16.844]  That's why I was rejecting Reagan and Nancy Reagan.
[03:48:18.184 --> 03:48:25.468]  But now that I've studied it more in depth, I realize that they were patriots who tried to save this country and Reagan almost gave his life for it.
[03:48:26.974 --> 03:48:31.138]  And they demonized this poor woman and isolated her and ran incredible psyops against her.
[03:48:31.158 --> 03:48:39.826]  And now reading books about the Reagans, both from enemies and friends, when she sat there and kissed his casket and didn't want to leave his casket and the rest of it, she really loved that man.
[03:48:39.846 --> 03:48:51.076]  And it's the idea of a man and woman loving each other and humanity loving each other and having value and appreciating good leaders is what's going to save our civilization and our society.
[03:48:52.005 --> 03:49:00.710]  Because I thought this morning, I thought, nostalgically, I thought, why did I dislike the Reagans so much, even though I've always been a libertarian, paleo-conservative?
[03:49:01.290 --> 03:49:05.792]  Why did I still have disdainful thoughts in the back of my mind?
[03:49:07.053 --> 03:49:14.917]  And it was because, as a child, watching Dan Rather, and growing up where every night my mom cooked dinner while she watched the nightly news, and the Laird NewsHour,
[03:49:17.685 --> 03:49:20.766]  That I was indoctrinated at a subconscious level.
[03:49:21.606 --> 03:49:22.467]  I mean, the hate!
[03:49:23.227 --> 03:49:24.067]  And what was it over?
[03:49:24.147 --> 03:49:28.529]  How she looked, how she talked, the fact that she looked, you know, that she dressed conservatively.
[03:49:28.889 --> 03:49:31.790]  Man, don't you wish people were classy like they used to be?
[03:49:33.140 --> 03:49:45.524]  Also back when the breast cancer rate was almost 3,000% lower and bone cancer rates were, and pediatric cancers were way lower, because we really are a poisoned, glyphosated, vaccinated, dumbed-down population today.
[03:49:45.564 --> 03:49:47.405]  You can say what you want about folks back then, but...
[03:49:50.677 --> 03:49:58.479]  They were nicer, they were more gentlemanly, they were more ladylike, and they at least were for sovereignty and proud of this country.
[03:49:58.859 --> 03:50:01.940]  We have leaders now that want to destroy our sovereignty and sink this nation.
[03:50:02.660 --> 03:50:05.001]  Because they're aspiring to get jobs in the global government.
[03:50:05.881 --> 03:50:06.501]  They admit that.
[03:50:06.561 --> 03:50:08.142]  Clinton admits he wants to be the head of the UN.
[03:50:08.942 --> 03:50:09.942]  Tony Blair, all of them.
[03:50:10.242 --> 03:50:10.962]  It's disgusting.
[03:50:12.423 --> 03:50:15.944]  Ronald Reagan never wanted to be the next president of the world government.
[03:50:16.624 --> 03:50:17.884]  Ronald Reagan fought against that.
[03:50:19.405 --> 03:50:19.805]  That's why
[03:50:21.493 --> 03:50:24.394]  They tried to kill him, and then tried to keep him drugged up.
[03:50:25.154 --> 03:50:30.576]  That's why sometimes he'd come out and would be really on and doing great, and then other times he'd come back and didn't seem like he was there.
[03:50:31.456 --> 03:50:33.236]  And I've talked to the insiders, folks.
[03:50:33.296 --> 03:50:34.357]  They were jacking with him.
[03:50:34.397 --> 03:50:38.158]  He never got out of their medical clutches after they shot him there in D.C.
[03:50:42.148 --> 03:50:47.151]  I'm gonna go ahead and throw the transmission back to the live coverage here on InfoWars Live.
[03:50:48.031 --> 03:50:48.651]  Don't believe me?
[03:50:48.711 --> 03:50:52.593]  Check out history for yourself and you'll find out the rabbit hole goes even deeper.
[03:50:54.434 --> 03:50:59.057]  That's right, and I firmly believe the Bush-H.W.
[03:50:59.297 --> 03:51:00.578]  had three terms as president.
[03:51:01.038 --> 03:51:01.998]  First two were with Reagan.
[03:51:02.379 --> 03:51:03.059]  So there you have it.
[03:51:03.099 --> 03:51:04.880]  We'll be back with your calls, Tim and Carmen.
[03:51:04.900 --> 03:51:06.541]  Y'all stay tuned, hang on the line.
[03:51:06.661 --> 03:51:08.482]  It's InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:51:11.468 --> 03:51:13.369]  My name is Don Whiskin.
[03:51:13.449 --> 03:51:18.312]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:18.412 --> 03:51:22.214]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:51:22.434 --> 03:51:23.555]  He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:23.995 --> 03:51:27.437]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:51:27.877 --> 03:51:32.379]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:51:32.659 --> 03:51:33.500]  He waited too long.
[03:51:33.920 --> 03:51:36.921]  In June, that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:51:37.281 --> 03:51:37.922]  What did I do?
[03:51:38.162 --> 03:51:45.425]  I took a 7-herb formula I now call ExtendoVite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle, and valerian.
[03:51:45.625 --> 03:51:53.768]  Based on German studies of natural medicine, ExtendoVite is designed to clear blocked arteries, clean the toxins from your blood, and improve your immune system.

[03:52:20.574 --> 03:52:29.539]  I'm Joe Alton, MD of store.doomandbloom.net, where you'll find an entire line of uniquely designed medical kits and supplies for when help is not on the way.

[03:54:23.595 --> 03:54:27.777]  Final segment of this March 7th edition of the Alex Jones Show.

[03:54:29.857 --> 03:54:32.419]  You can watch it at InfoWars.com forward slash show.

[03:54:37.643 --> 03:54:40.725]  There's my Twitter handle there, DewsNews.
[03:54:41.406 --> 03:54:43.547]  The Z is at the end of news.
[03:54:44.448 --> 03:54:45.329]  Got two more callers.
[03:54:45.689 --> 03:54:50.412]  Tim in Wyoming wants to talk about PC, actually, yeah, let's go to Tim first.
[03:54:50.512 --> 03:54:51.853]  PC Culture and Ted Cruz.
[03:54:51.954 --> 03:54:53.475]  And then we got Carmen wants to talk about Trump.
[03:54:54.355 --> 03:54:54.916]  Tim, go ahead.
[03:54:56.232 --> 03:54:56.852]  Hi, Rob.
[03:54:56.872 --> 03:54:57.752]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:54:57.772 --> 03:54:58.673]  I appreciate it.
[03:54:58.713 --> 03:54:59.633]  I'll make this real quick.
[03:54:59.673 --> 03:55:07.935]  Now, I wanted to mention Ted Cruz because of his supposedly, what he said is conservative basis, but he said Ted's conservatism.
[03:55:07.995 --> 03:55:12.536]  And I thought, well, his pseudo-conservatism, more like it because... Well, let me tell you this.
[03:55:12.556 --> 03:55:18.617]  When I say anything bad about Ted Cruz, all the conservative Twitter hacks come out in full force and attack me.
[03:55:18.857 --> 03:55:22.538]  So, but I'm not, I don't think he's a real conservative personally, but go ahead.
[03:55:23.018 --> 03:55:24.199]  Let him attack me instead.
[03:55:24.219 --> 03:55:24.879]  It wasn't Rob's fault.
[03:55:24.899 --> 03:55:27.300]  He just let Tim run on over himself.
[03:55:27.360 --> 03:55:28.241]  Supposedly conservatism.
[03:55:28.261 --> 03:55:32.923]  If he was a strict constitutionalist, a real constructionist, he would actually say, I cannot be
[03:55:44.173 --> 03:55:52.855]  The President of the United States of America, even though I've been put up by the globalists to be this guy, I cannot be this guy because I was born in Canada.
[03:55:53.515 --> 03:56:00.056]  And his mother was registered to vote in Canada, so obviously she was a Canadian citizen when he was born too, so there's another thing.
[03:56:00.096 --> 03:56:11.759]  But anyway, I wanted to mention there was a caller from Canada, speaking of Canada, who said something about the border protection people with the triangle and the green emblem, whatever it was.
[03:56:13.778 --> 03:56:22.661]  Unless I'm mistaken, was Ted Cruz supporting, I think Ted Cruz was supporting the North American Union or the NAFTA superhighway, am I right?
[03:56:23.461 --> 03:56:24.642]  I'm gonna look that up right now.
[03:56:24.662 --> 03:56:29.224]  I'm not sure if he was, I don't know if he was in office when NAFTA was rolling around.
[03:56:29.244 --> 03:56:37.586]  I just remember, I remember Hillary Clinton was getting hammered about it last night by Bernie Sanders because she does support all these
[03:56:40.011 --> 03:56:43.813]  Heidi Cruz helped write NAFTA, so yeah, I'm sure he does support it.
[03:56:43.833 --> 03:56:45.414]  He's an advocate of the North American Union.
[03:56:45.514 --> 03:56:46.514]  Oh no, somebody asked that.
[03:56:47.795 --> 03:56:49.876]  Yeah, his wife is a total globalist.
[03:56:49.896 --> 03:56:50.856]  She's a Bush acolyte.
[03:56:50.916 --> 03:56:51.837]  I don't know what that makes him.
[03:56:53.506 --> 03:57:02.633]  Interesting enough, I was looking at the Bush family, because they're mentioning Neil Bush, and I thought he was the same guy running security at the Twin Towers, and it wasn't.
[03:57:02.653 --> 03:57:03.274]  It was Marvin.
[03:57:03.794 --> 03:57:09.098]  But they have one of the sisters, Bush sisters, is married to a Koch, or a Coke, however you say it.
[03:57:09.779 --> 03:57:10.820]  I thought that was pretty interesting.
[03:57:10.900 --> 03:57:13.402]  Her last name is Cock, or Coach, however you say it.
[03:57:13.602 --> 03:57:13.922]  I don't know.
[03:57:14.322 --> 03:57:15.603]  Anyway, hey, thanks for calling Tim.
[03:57:15.663 --> 03:57:17.485]  Carmen in New Jersey, you're our tail gunner.
[03:57:17.985 --> 03:57:18.946]  You want to talk about Trump?
[03:57:20.786 --> 03:57:22.687]  Yeah, Rob, how you doing, my brother?
[03:57:22.707 --> 03:57:23.808]  Doing good, doing good.
[03:57:25.269 --> 03:57:25.969]  Awesome, man.
[03:57:26.029 --> 03:57:27.770]  I've been trying for years to get on this show.
[03:57:27.790 --> 03:57:43.120]  You know, first, before I say anything, I want to thank you personally, because I had entered the Paul Revere Operation Paul Revere contest, the video contest, and you and David and I played my video on your show.
[03:57:43.180 --> 03:57:45.061]  It was Imagination Up In Arms.
[03:57:47.429 --> 03:57:48.690]  Okay.
[03:57:48.770 --> 03:57:51.472]  I don't remember that one particularly, but that was a long time ago.
[03:57:51.672 --> 03:57:54.835]  We've had so many contests since then, but that was a good one.
[03:57:55.135 --> 03:57:59.559]  The one that really sticks out in my mind is the one where Michael Moore got waterboarded.
[03:58:01.040 --> 03:58:02.842]  But yeah, we had some great entries.
[03:58:03.062 --> 03:58:05.664]  We had some great entries for that Paul Revere contest.
[03:58:06.525 --> 03:58:11.669]  So you must have made it to the semi-finals at least, I guess, if we played your video live.
[03:58:11.689 --> 03:58:12.930]  So I'm going to go, what was it called again?
[03:58:12.970 --> 03:58:13.531]  Imagination?
[03:58:14.815 --> 03:58:16.497]  It was imagination up in arms.
[03:58:16.517 --> 03:58:18.981]  It's a music video with the police brutality.
[03:58:19.381 --> 03:58:19.782]  Oh, okay.
[03:58:19.822 --> 03:58:21.885]  Yeah, keep going, keep going.
[03:58:23.953 --> 03:58:28.456]  You even started talking about that you had Global Love Cop, and you had your own band stuff.
[03:58:28.476 --> 03:58:30.197]  I'm still waiting to hear some of that stuff.
[03:58:30.397 --> 03:58:31.398]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:58:31.418 --> 03:58:31.938]  Now I remember.
[03:58:31.978 --> 03:58:36.782]  We did have a song called Global Love Cop, which was inspired by Alex Jones dressing up as a Global Love Cop.
[03:58:37.102 --> 03:58:38.503]  We're all inspired by Alex Jones.
[03:58:38.543 --> 03:58:39.864]  He's a total badass.
[03:58:40.244 --> 03:58:45.127]  Thanks for joining us on the Infowars.com forward slash show, Alex Jones Show.
