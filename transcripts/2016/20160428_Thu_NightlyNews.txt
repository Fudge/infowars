[00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.243]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.383 --> 00:00:23.263]  I'm Darren McBreen.
[00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:25.164]  It is Thursday, April 28, 2016.
[00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:28.685]  Here's a quick look at what's coming up.
[00:00:32.326 --> 00:00:41.930]  Tonight, as the 28 pages gain mainstream acceptance, more and more Americans want to see them.
[00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:47.441]  I was wondering, would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 commission report?
[00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:48.742]  Would you be one to see those released?
[00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:50.302]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[00:00:50.322 --> 00:00:50.622]  You got them?
[00:00:51.063 --> 00:00:56.085]  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia threatens financial sanctions against the U.S.
[00:00:56.505 --> 00:01:00.167]  if prying eyes continue to investigate 9-11.
[00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:01.647]  That's next.
[00:01:02.648 --> 00:01:04.629]  You're sex slavers.
[00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:06.850]  That's what your family made money in.
[00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:07.590]  That's who you are.
[00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:12.607]  So of course you've adopted a brand of Islam where women are slaves.
[00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:15.990]  I mean, you are literally the filth of Earth!
[00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:19.052]  I just... You're not my God!
[00:01:19.532 --> 00:01:21.173]  No, I will break the political correctness!
[00:01:21.453 --> 00:01:24.295]  I am not for pouring acid on little girls' faces!
[00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:24.856]  Filth!
[00:01:25.536 --> 00:01:28.098]  Go to hell where you came from!
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:02.387 --> 00:03:08.852]  We begin this evening with a warning to the United States from the government of Saudi Arabia.
[00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:13.716]  Release the 28 pages and you will face an economic collapse.
[00:03:14.116 --> 00:03:20.161]  That's right, the Saudis are threatening the United States with financial terrorism.
[00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:26.205]  And they have warned the Obama White House that they are ready to sell off $750 billion worth of U.S.
[00:03:26.225 --> 00:03:26.606]  Treasury bonds.
[00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.352]  Which could seriously cripple or even destroy the U.S.
[00:03:35.793 --> 00:03:36.253]  economy.
[00:03:36.473 --> 00:03:40.657]  But why on earth would Saudi Arabia threaten the United States?
[00:03:40.697 --> 00:03:42.878]  I mean, they're supposed to be our ally, right?
[00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:52.166]  Well, it's because Saudi officials and members of the Saudi royal family are panicking right now over a federal lawsuit.
[00:03:52.606 --> 00:04:14.955]  Which may finally reveal the contents of the still classified 28 pages of the Joint Inquiry Intelligence Report on 9-11, which will prove once and for all that the government of Saudi Arabia helped finance and assist the terrorist hijackers responsible for the attacks on 9-11.
[00:04:15.216 --> 00:04:20.558]  And this is where I say it looks like the conspiracy theorists were right all along.
[00:04:21.178 --> 00:04:22.498]  Don't say we didn't tell you so.
[00:04:23.119 --> 00:04:29.220]  And who was it that made the decision to classify the 28 pages to begin with?
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.620]  Well, you guessed it.
[00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:32.841]  George W. Bush.
[00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:40.803]  Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September the 11th.
[00:04:41.983 --> 00:04:45.964]  Malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves.
[00:04:46.945 --> 00:04:47.805]  Away from the guilty.
[00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:55.908]  And don't forget, Bush and Cheney, they never even wanted an investigation into 9-11 to begin with.
[00:04:56.208 --> 00:05:06.161]  It was only until after the victims' families and the 9-11 survivors, it was after they demanded an investigation that the 9-11 Commission was created.
[00:05:06.482 --> 00:05:07.063]  And get this.
[00:05:07.463 --> 00:05:11.005]  Bush and Cheney refused to testify under oath.
[00:05:11.325 --> 00:05:19.268]  Instead, they agreed to meet with the 9-11 Commission only behind closed doors and under the following conditions.
[00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:21.269]  They would meet together.
[00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:28.112]  The session would not be recorded, nor would it be transcribed or made public.
[00:05:29.453 --> 00:05:31.534]  Very suspicious, don't you think?
[00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:39.075]  And even more bizarre, I think, was Bush's mannerisms and his body language.
[00:05:39.555 --> 00:05:47.140]  This was during the press conference right after he and Dick Cheney met with the 9-11 Commission.
[00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:54.045]  President, as you know, a lot of critics suggested that you wanted to appear jointly with the Vice President so that you two could keep your story straight or something.
[00:05:54.065 --> 00:05:58.928]  Can you tell us what you think of the value of appearing together and how you would answer those critics?
[00:05:58.968 --> 00:05:59.909]  Yeah, first of all, look.
[00:06:01.072 --> 00:06:03.533]  If we had something to hide, we wouldn't have met with him in the first place.
[00:06:04.154 --> 00:06:05.294]  We answered all their questions.
[00:06:05.374 --> 00:06:17.702]  And as I say, I think I came away good about the session because I wanted them to know, you know, how I set strategy, how we run the White House, how we deal with threats.
[00:06:19.102 --> 00:06:22.044]  The Vice President answered a lot of their questions, answered all their questions.
[00:06:22.684 --> 00:06:26.126]  And I think it was important for them to see our body language as well, how we work together.
[00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:28.228]  But it was
[00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:31.399]  You know, the commissioners will speak for themselves over time.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.442]  They will let you know whether they thought it was a fruitful series of discussions.
[00:06:35.482 --> 00:06:36.363]  I think they did.
[00:06:36.443 --> 00:06:39.465]  I think they found it to be useful.
[00:06:39.745 --> 00:06:40.606]  Yeah, Adam.
[00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:46.610]  Mr. President, don't you think that the families deserve to have a transcript or to be able to see what you said?
[00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.111]  Adam, you asked me that question yesterday.
[00:06:48.131 --> 00:06:49.932]  I got the same answer, yeah.
[00:06:50.633 --> 00:06:54.696]  You see right there, you can tell he's nervous and it looks like he's hiding something.
[00:06:55.526 --> 00:07:01.512]  And I think you can even get more of a sense of his awkwardness if you watch the press conference in its entirety.
[00:07:01.752 --> 00:07:03.053]  It's only five minutes long.
[00:07:03.093 --> 00:07:06.697]  I mean, Bush was in and out of there in a big hurry.
[00:07:07.157 --> 00:07:08.539]  He looks very uncomfortable.
[00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:10.260]  You could tell he doesn't want to be there.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.823]  I mean, he is squirming the entire time.
[00:07:13.223 --> 00:07:16.446]  And that's because they were hiding something.
[00:07:17.007 --> 00:07:17.587]  And guess what?
[00:07:18.048 --> 00:07:18.748]  They still are.
[00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:20.590]  So what are they so afraid of?
[00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:26.794]  I mean, why does Bush and the Saudi royal family, why do they want to keep the 28 pages secret?
[00:07:27.114 --> 00:07:35.379]  And why is President Barack Obama acting like such a coward when it comes to getting threats from Saudi Arabia?
[00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:38.461]  What on earth is in those 28 pages?
[00:07:38.941 --> 00:07:40.382]  Here's what we know so far.
[00:07:40.942 --> 00:07:56.715]  According to members of Congress from both parties who have read it, as well as the heads of the 9-11 Commission, they say the 28 pages will completely change everything you think you know about the 9-11 attacks.
[00:07:57.355 --> 00:07:59.917]  These documents will change history.
[00:08:00.738 --> 00:08:02.339]  This is sort of shocking when you read it.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.521]  As I read it, we all had our own experience.
[00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:10.306]  I had to stop every couple pages and just sort of absorb and try to rearrange
[00:08:10.916 --> 00:08:19.682]  My understanding of history for the past 13 years and years leading up to that, it challenges you to rethink everything.
[00:08:20.282 --> 00:08:24.365]  And so I think the whole country needs to go through that.
[00:08:24.605 --> 00:08:26.967]  I want those documents declassified.
[00:08:27.067 --> 00:08:33.071]  I'm embarrassed to be associated with a work product
[00:08:34.144 --> 00:08:34.905]  That is secret.
[00:08:35.485 --> 00:08:42.732]  Former Senator Bob Graham said that the 28 pages primarily relate to who financed 9-11.
[00:08:43.153 --> 00:08:44.054]  Follow the money, right?
[00:08:44.654 --> 00:08:52.021]  And they point a very strong finger at Saudi Arabia as being the principal financier.
[00:08:52.702 --> 00:09:05.982]  And I'll never forget watching Senator Max Cleland on CNN with Wolf Blitzer when he announced that he was going to resign from the 9-11 Commission because the entire investigation was a scam.
[00:09:07.541 --> 00:09:09.022]  We are legitimate members of the commission.
[00:09:09.082 --> 00:09:10.782]  We have the top security clearances.
[00:09:11.062 --> 00:09:12.283]  We're an independent commission.
[00:09:12.623 --> 00:09:24.207]  For an independent operational look at why 9-11 happened, what happened there, what the president and the government knew, and when they knew it, we need to know all the answers.
[00:09:24.227 --> 00:09:25.067]  What's their argument?
[00:09:25.087 --> 00:09:25.587]  The White House.
[00:09:25.647 --> 00:09:26.808]  Why won't they let you see this?
[00:09:26.828 --> 00:09:28.068]  What do they say?
[00:09:28.328 --> 00:09:33.330]  They don't want any more eyeballs to see their documents than they can possibly get away with.
[00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:34.890]  It's a scam.
[00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.411]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[00:09:37.338 --> 00:09:52.254]  Now here's where it gets even more interesting, because not only does the 28 pages reveal Saudi Arabian involvement in the September 11th attacks, but it also specifies sources, we're talking names, alright?
[00:09:52.554 --> 00:09:58.460]  We're talking specific individuals that are implicated here, and one of the names on the list is
[00:09:59.421 --> 00:10:00.862]  Extremely significant.
[00:10:01.122 --> 00:10:03.064]  We're talking bombshell.
[00:10:03.084 --> 00:10:04.725]  In fact, drumroll please.
[00:10:05.706 --> 00:10:11.250]  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Prince Bandar bin Sultan.
[00:10:12.469 --> 00:10:18.934]  Who was the Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States at the time of the terrorist attacks on 9-11.
[00:10:19.815 --> 00:10:26.500]  And he also just happens to be a lifelong intimate and personal friend of the Bush family.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:33.705]  In fact, he is so close with the Bushes that his nickname around the White House is Bandar Bush.
[00:10:34.346 --> 00:10:34.786]  Look it up.
[00:10:35.227 --> 00:10:36.488]  It's an open secret.
[00:10:37.153 --> 00:10:43.916]  Not only is Prince Bandar a longtime business partner of the Bushes, but they also have a very close friendship together.
[00:10:43.956 --> 00:10:50.598]  And this, of course, includes Bush Sr., who would bring Prince Bandar along on hunting trips.
[00:10:50.658 --> 00:10:54.900]  They would go fishing together, hang out with the family, go on vacations.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.601]  A very cozy relationship.
[00:10:57.961 --> 00:11:01.623]  And this is troubling because that means two sitting U.S.
[00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:06.545]  presidents had close personal and financial ties with a foreign power.
[00:11:07.506 --> 00:11:07.766]  Get it?
[00:11:08.446 --> 00:11:11.287]  I mean, this was an unholy alliance.
[00:11:11.687 --> 00:11:12.627]  Well, it still is.
[00:11:13.668 --> 00:11:25.031]  And in one of the redacted sections of the 28 pages, there is evidence of a transfer of $130,000 from Prince Bandar's wife that went directly into the checking account of the 9-11 hijackers.
[00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:25.211]  Wow!
[00:11:32.193 --> 00:11:38.655]  And there was also other members of the Saudi royal family, all of these guys who have close ties with the Bush cartel, by the way.
[00:11:39.135 --> 00:11:49.939]  And according to the 28 pages, they provided financial assistance to several of the 9-11 hijackers, and then they fled the country days before the attacks.
[00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:55.360]  Now, I want you to picture this because what I'm about to tell you actually happened.
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.461]  It is documented and it is in the White House logs.
[00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:06.162]  This occurred just a couple days after September 11th, September 13th to be exact.
[00:12:06.562 --> 00:12:19.505]  But President George W. Bush and Prince Bandar, they were actually hanging out together during a private meeting, smoking Cohiba cigars on the Truman Balcony at the White House.
[00:12:20.345 --> 00:12:24.968]  Well, I tell you what, I sure would have liked to have been a fly on the wall during that conversation.
[00:12:25.788 --> 00:12:29.150]  But I have a pretty good idea what they were talking about.
[00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:47.501]  I imagine they were discussing the evacuation plan and how they worked together to evacuate and to smuggle out of the country members of the Saudi royal family, Saudi officials, and even members of the bin Laden family out of the country immediately after the 9-11 attacks.
[00:12:49.142 --> 00:12:56.545]  And keep in mind, this was during the time when all air travel in the continental United States was grounded.
[00:12:57.165 --> 00:13:12.631]  Nobody was allowed to fly, yet the order was given straight from the White House to evacuate Saudi Arabians and even members of the Bin Laden family, one of them who was actually on the terror watch list at the time.
[00:13:12.991 --> 00:13:13.592]  Incredible!
[00:13:14.572 --> 00:13:22.397]  And they were flown out of the United States, dozens of them from multiple cities all across the country, back to Saudi Arabia.
[00:13:22.717 --> 00:13:29.441]  And instead of interrogating these guys and asking them questions, well, the FBI provided security.
[00:13:29.882 --> 00:13:34.565]  And they smuggled these suspects out of the country.
[00:13:35.532 --> 00:13:37.935]  You see there, even Bill O'Reilly is finally talking about it now.
[00:13:37.955 --> 00:13:39.637]  Better late than never, I guess.
[00:13:52.270 --> 00:14:16.926]  And, you know, what really gets me, it makes me angry, it bothered me back then, and it really bothers me now in hindsight, and that is the rhetoric, the warmongering, the hypocrite George W. Bush at the time, who was well aware of the fact that the 9-11 terrorist attacks were not only largely funded by the government of Saudi Arabia, but also in part
[00:14:17.566 --> 00:14:22.150]  By his very close and personal friend, Bandar Bush.
[00:14:22.771 --> 00:14:23.772]  I mean, what the f**k?
[00:14:24.673 --> 00:14:29.397]  Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make.
[00:14:30.838 --> 00:14:34.642]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:14:37.605 --> 00:14:41.168]  And that, my friends, was the worst president in U.S.
[00:14:41.288 --> 00:14:41.688]  history.
[00:14:42.523 --> 00:14:43.905]  Well, until now.
[00:14:44.807 --> 00:14:51.617]  Barack Hussein Obama has promised on at least two separate occasions that he would release the 28 pages.
[00:14:55.386 --> 00:14:56.147]  We're still waiting.
[00:14:56.948 --> 00:15:06.817]  You know, he actually met with the 9-11 victims' family members and the survivors, met them face-to-face, looked them in the eyes, and promised them that he would release the 28 pages.
[00:15:07.218 --> 00:15:12.143]  Now we're finding out that he's never even bothered to read the documents.
[00:15:13.424 --> 00:15:17.968]  The 28 pages of the 9-11 report, have you read it?
[00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:21.430]  You know, I have a sense of what's in there.
[00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:36.877]  Jim Clapper, our Director of National Intelligence, has been going through to make sure that whatever it is that is released is not going to compromise some major national security interest of the United States.
[00:15:37.837 --> 00:15:44.123]  And what was Obama's reaction to the threats made by Saudi Arabia to destroy our economy?
[00:15:44.763 --> 00:16:01.519]  Well, he boarded Air Force One on a direct flight to Riyadh to go bow down to the Saudi King, King Salman, who, by the way, is also mentioned by name reportedly in the 28 pages as yet another financier of the attacks on our country.
[00:16:02.119 --> 00:16:04.802]  Yeah, that looks like an accurate depiction right there.
[00:16:05.182 --> 00:16:16.515]  Obama says he will veto the bill in Congress that would release the 28 pages to the public and allow the 9-11 victims' families and survivors of the attack to sue the Saudi government.
[00:16:17.016 --> 00:16:18.597]  Not going to happen.
[00:16:19.398 --> 00:16:27.524]  We don't know what's in those pages, except that we do know it pertains to the Saudi government and two American presidents don't want it released.
[00:16:27.764 --> 00:16:28.985]  Add to this the following.
[00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:43.335]  Last year, President Obama signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia to provide for the sale of 60 billion, with a B, dollars worth of weaponry over the next 10 years from American arms merchants to the Saudi government.
[00:16:43.835 --> 00:16:49.798]  Donald Trump, on the other hand, says if he becomes president, he will indeed release the 28 pages.
[00:16:50.119 --> 00:16:53.981]  And that's why we need an anti-establishment president.
[00:16:54.621 --> 00:17:01.325]  And for those of you out there who say that it's not good enough, there's more to 9-11 than just the 28 pages.
[00:17:01.425 --> 00:17:03.146]  Well, I'd have to agree with you.
[00:17:03.466 --> 00:17:04.507]  You're absolutely right.
[00:17:04.987 --> 00:17:05.667]  But get this.
[00:17:06.508 --> 00:17:13.312]  Once these documents are released to the public, that's when the entire house of cards begins to fall.
[00:17:23.223 --> 00:17:25.684]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:17:26.264 --> 00:17:27.825]  It just pancaked.
[00:17:28.045 --> 00:17:30.607]  Well, pancaking almost like a precision implosion.
[00:17:34.889 --> 00:17:43.393]  It's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before, when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[00:17:59.326 --> 00:18:04.090]  There's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now.
[00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:09.674]  And if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation, well I'll tell you how.
[00:18:10.194 --> 00:18:15.698]  When the Democrats showed their true colors, you got angry and you elected Republicans.
[00:18:16.219 --> 00:18:21.463]  And then when the Republicans showed their true colors, you got angry and elected Democrats.
[00:18:21.883 --> 00:18:31.972]  And when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your best interest, you acted like they were crazy.
[00:18:32.553 --> 00:18:40.260]  But the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:46.664]  That's why it is vitally important that you wake up, America, and break the matrix.
[00:18:47.024 --> 00:18:51.967]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:52.387 --> 00:18:54.848]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:19:04.914 --> 00:19:09.297]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.091]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.773 --> 00:19:15.774]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.435 --> 00:19:27.204]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type 1 civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.865 --> 00:19:39.234]  You can say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering,
[00:19:40.742 --> 00:19:50.145]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.

[00:22:56.774 --> 00:22:58.875]  The Vice President and I just finished a good conversation.
[00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:18.049]  With the 9-1-1 Commission.
[00:23:18.109 --> 00:23:19.250]  It was wide-ranging.
[00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.891]  It was important.
[00:23:25.252 --> 00:23:28.813]  It was just a good discussion.
[00:23:29.053 --> 00:23:30.693]  And I really appreciate the members.
[00:23:34.354 --> 00:23:45.898]  I want to thank the Chairman and Vice Chairman for bringing the Commission here and giving us a chance to share views on different subjects.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:51.423]  They had a lot of good questions, and I'm glad I did it.
[00:23:51.463 --> 00:23:52.443]  I'm glad I took the time.
[00:23:52.743 --> 00:24:07.412]  This is an important commission, and it's important that they ask the questions they ask so that they can help make recommendations necessary to better protect our homeland.
[00:24:07.452 --> 00:24:08.353]  I enjoyed it.
[00:24:08.373 --> 00:24:10.414]  Let me ask you a couple of questions.
[00:24:11.152 --> 00:24:14.935]  Mr. President, what topic did the commissioners want to spend most of the time on?
[00:24:15.355 --> 00:24:20.239]  And were there any subjects that you didn't answer or were advised by your counsel not to answer?
[00:24:20.259 --> 00:24:20.299]  No.
[00:24:20.739 --> 00:24:23.382]  I was never advised by my counsel not to answer anything.
[00:24:23.422 --> 00:24:27.365]  I answered every question they asked.
[00:24:27.765 --> 00:24:34.570]  Probably best that I not go into the details of the conversation and let them incorporate into their report.
[00:24:36.171 --> 00:24:39.214]  There was a lot of interest, excuse me, a lot of interest in about
[00:24:41.136 --> 00:24:43.819]  Uh, about how to better protect America.
[00:24:44.639 --> 00:24:50.004]  They're very interested in the recommendations that they're going to lay out and I'm interested in those as well.
[00:24:50.945 --> 00:24:54.709]  And, uh, we discussed a lot of things, Terry, a lot of subjects.
[00:24:55.710 --> 00:25:02.035]  Uh, and, uh, it was a very cordial conversation.
[00:25:02.096 --> 00:25:06.640]  I was, I was impressed by the questions and, uh, and it was a,
[00:25:07.503 --> 00:25:13.007]  I think it helped him understand how I think and how I run the White House and how we deal with threats.
[00:25:13.027 --> 00:25:13.247]  John?
[00:25:13.708 --> 00:25:19.773]  Mr. President, as you know, a lot of critics suggested that you wanted to appear jointly with the Vice President so that you two could keep your story straight or something.
[00:25:19.793 --> 00:25:24.596]  Can you tell us what you think of the value of appearing together and how you would answer those critics?
[00:25:24.616 --> 00:25:24.997]  Yeah.
[00:25:25.037 --> 00:25:29.260]  First of all, look, I mean, if we had something to hide, we wouldn't have met with him in the first place.
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.001]  We answered all their questions.
[00:25:31.081 --> 00:25:35.585]  And as I say, I think I came away good about the session.
[00:25:36.875 --> 00:25:43.397]  Because I wanted them to know, you know, how I set strategy, how we run the White House, how we deal with threats.
[00:25:44.777 --> 00:25:47.738]  The Vice President answered a lot of their questions, answered all their questions.
[00:25:48.379 --> 00:25:51.800]  And I think it was important for them to see our body language as well, how we work together.
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:57.121]  But it was, you know, the commissioners will speak for themselves over time.
[00:25:57.141 --> 00:26:01.142]  They will let you know whether they thought it was a fruitful series of discussions.
[00:26:01.422 --> 00:26:01.923]  I think they did.
[00:26:03.777 --> 00:26:05.158]  I think they found it to be useful.
[00:26:05.418 --> 00:26:06.298]  Yeah, Adam.
[00:26:06.358 --> 00:26:12.261]  Mr. President, don't you think that the families deserve to have a transcript, or to be able to see what you say?
[00:26:12.281 --> 00:26:13.822]  Adam, you asked me that question yesterday.
[00:26:14.442 --> 00:26:15.603]  I got the same answer, yeah.
[00:26:15.623 --> 00:26:20.605]  Can you say with any confidence that there are no Al-Qaeda operatives active in the country today?
[00:26:21.626 --> 00:26:22.366]  No, I can't say that.
[00:26:22.386 --> 00:26:24.727]  They didn't ask you about that.
[00:26:24.747 --> 00:26:25.207]  No, they didn't.
[00:26:26.568 --> 00:26:28.829]  But I'm not going to get any more details about what they asked me.
[00:26:28.889 --> 00:26:32.311]  I told you I wasn't going to get any details about what they asked me, and then I just fell into your trap.
[00:26:33.351 --> 00:26:36.773]  But let me talk about vulnerabilities and I've got to get back to work.
[00:26:37.453 --> 00:26:38.813]  We are still vulnerable to attack.
[00:26:40.834 --> 00:26:45.176]  And the reason why is Al-Qaeda still exists.
[00:26:45.276 --> 00:26:46.177]  Al-Qaeda is dangerous.
[00:26:46.257 --> 00:26:47.137]  Al-Qaeda hates us.
[00:26:48.498 --> 00:26:54.681]  And we have to be correct 100% of the time in defending America.
[00:26:54.701 --> 00:26:55.661]  And they've got to be right once.
[00:26:56.842 --> 00:26:59.363]  And therefore, we are vulnerable.
[00:27:00.343 --> 00:27:01.884]  But people need to know we're working
[00:27:02.762 --> 00:27:08.848]  We, the government, at all levels, are working long hours to protect America.
[00:27:08.868 --> 00:27:09.729]  We're doing the best we can.
[00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:16.635]  The best way to secure America, however, is to stay on the offensive and bring those people to justice before they harm America again.
[00:27:17.476 --> 00:27:18.817]  And that's what we're continuing to do.
[00:27:19.258 --> 00:27:25.183]  But, you know, so long as there's an al-Qaeda enemy that is willing to kill, we are vulnerable.
[00:27:26.284 --> 00:27:26.765]  Thank you all.
[00:27:58.291 --> 00:28:04.365]  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[00:28:05.287 --> 00:28:10.332]  The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony.
[00:28:11.173 --> 00:28:18.520]  I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down.
[00:28:19.101 --> 00:28:29.091]  And under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs.
[00:28:31.007 --> 00:28:38.133]  It didn't take long for German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier to react to Donald Trump's America First rhetoric.
[00:28:38.253 --> 00:28:45.319]  Steinmeier said, The world's security architecture has changed and it is no longer based on two pillars alone.
[00:28:45.479 --> 00:28:47.761]  It cannot be conducted unilaterally.
[00:28:47.981 --> 00:28:53.105]  No American president can get round this change in the international security architecture.
[00:28:53.445 --> 00:28:54.066]  Steinmeier
[00:28:54.426 --> 00:29:06.094]  A Bilderberg attendee is referring to the New World Order rollout of the United Nations infestation of the United States local police force with its Strong Cities Network, announced by the U.S.
[00:29:06.214 --> 00:29:11.238]  Constitution-circumventing Attorney General's Office to the United Nations in 2015, no less.
[00:29:12.819 --> 00:29:20.362]  Furthermore, is it any wonder why the Strong Cities Network recognizes constitutionalists as their number one threat?
[00:29:20.702 --> 00:29:23.844]  And just what kind of force is behind Lynch's words?
[00:29:24.204 --> 00:29:30.806]  The UN houses the permanent delegations of the Sharia Law Enforcing Organization of Islamic Cooperation.
[00:29:31.086 --> 00:29:39.310]  The OIC, as it's known, is overseeing the cancerous expansion of Sharia law with the assistance of the United Nations,
[00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:42.111]  The OIC is based in Astana, the capital city of Kazakhstan.
[00:29:42.131 --> 00:29:44.832]  Astana is a planned 21st century New World Order city by all accounts.
[00:30:04.099 --> 00:30:15.003]  Meaning, its array of one world government promoting structures were built with the Kazakhstan's petrodollars to act as the headquarters for the emerging New World Order takeover.
[00:30:15.163 --> 00:30:18.924]  Kazakhstan is led by Nursultan Nazarbayev.
[00:30:19.185 --> 00:30:24.466]  By all accounts, a human rights violating dictator that has ruled over Kazakhstan for nearly 26 years.
[00:30:26.107 --> 00:30:49.338]  Under Nazarbayev, as CBS reported in 2011, severe limits on political freedoms and freedom of speech, detainee and prisoner abuse, arbitrary arrest and detention, particularly of government opponents, lack of an independent judiciary, pervasive corruption, discrimination and violence against women and trafficking in persons are typical of Nazarbayev's rule.
[00:30:49.578 --> 00:30:54.961]  A recent New York Times story claims Nazarbayev's regime has been paying Washington, D.C.
[00:30:55.441 --> 00:31:00.425]  Basically, a 21st century occultic hub run by a New World Order dictator with his hands in the pockets of your elected leaders
[00:31:22.384 --> 00:31:29.031]  Is the epicenter of the Islamic Sharia movement exploding in Europe and quietly invading the United States.
[00:31:29.351 --> 00:31:31.753]  Should Sharia law be over the U.S.
[00:31:31.793 --> 00:31:32.434]  Constitution?
[00:31:32.973 --> 00:31:34.294]  This isn't a drill.
[00:31:34.314 --> 00:31:36.896]  The engineered collapse of civilization is well underway.
[00:31:36.916 --> 00:31:44.901]  Billions of dollars and decades of planning have been invested in the very international security architecture Donald Trump and patriotic Americans must
[00:32:02.592 --> 00:32:03.875]  Actively Dismantle.
[00:32:04.376 --> 00:32:06.341]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:22.872]  No one will go to the New York Times or care that it's even admitted that the government's hatching most of the terror plots.
[00:32:23.412 --> 00:32:24.532]  Or people will say, what are you doing?
[00:32:24.853 --> 00:32:26.053]  Endorsing radical Islam?
[00:32:26.093 --> 00:32:26.853]  Saying it doesn't exist?
[00:32:27.213 --> 00:32:27.934]  I didn't say that!
[00:32:28.634 --> 00:32:37.857]  I said our criminal government is arming them, aiding and abetting them, protecting them to attack and kill us so they can take our freedoms!
[00:32:38.397 --> 00:32:39.818]  That's what I think!
[00:32:40.078 --> 00:32:40.558]  Sid!
[00:32:40.679 --> 00:32:46.422]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:32:46.862 --> 00:32:50.725]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:32:52.746 --> 00:33:00.911]  CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, Glenn Beck, everybody else that runs around claiming that I'm saying there aren't any real Muslim terrorists.
[00:33:01.252 --> 00:33:04.754]  That's a load... A lot of people ask me what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.
[00:33:57.342 --> 00:34:05.626]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when products are sold out, you're unable to get them, sometimes for months, but we hold back the products for people that have already signed up for AutoShip.
[00:34:06.286 --> 00:34:17.391]  When you choose AutoShip before checkout on your order at Infowarshore.com, we'll give you 10% off and give you guaranteed delivery of out-of-stock products that are on your AutoShip list.

[00:34:21.033 --> 00:34:28.437]  Listers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products when you need them each month.
[00:34:29.474 --> 00:34:30.494]  Now it's finally here.
[00:34:30.954 --> 00:34:34.455]  AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:34:34.775 --> 00:34:35.255]  It's easy.
[00:34:35.295 --> 00:34:42.117]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product, click on the AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:34:42.937 --> 00:34:49.699]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, it's a sure win.
[00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:53.400]  You add to that free shipping on orders of $50, it is a can't lose.

[00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:04.155]  That's InfoWarsTore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:03.726 --> 00:37:08.869]  Well, for the balance of the hour, George Norrie, who needs no introduction, will be our guest.
[00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:14.313]  And then we've got Mark Dice joining us with a ton of news, and then your phone calls in the third hour.
[00:37:14.393 --> 00:37:16.514]  Then Anthony Gucciardi will host the fourth hour.
[00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:17.915]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:37:17.935 --> 00:37:19.456]  The website's InfoWars.com.
[00:37:19.996 --> 00:37:21.117]  There's a lot of big news there.
[00:37:21.137 --> 00:37:23.719]  I'm going to be going over with George Norrie and getting his take on it.
[00:37:23.739 --> 00:37:32.625]  George Norrie is a Navy veteran, three-time Emmy Award winner for news coverage, good friend of mine.
[00:37:33.482 --> 00:37:39.249]  And of course he hosts the second largest radio show in the world, according to the ratings, Coast to Coast AM.
[00:37:39.569 --> 00:37:44.355]  Coast to Coast AM.com on almost 600 stations, or is it more than 600 stations?
[00:37:44.676 --> 00:37:48.160]  He's also on XM and 37 years of broadcast experience.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.503]  BeyondBelief.com is his TV show.
[00:37:50.903 --> 00:37:52.786]  Coast to Coast AM.com is obviously
[00:37:54.358 --> 00:38:08.147]  The big, I almost just call it, open-minded, free-thinking program where they cover everything under the sun, from the New World Order, to vaccines, to earth changes, to are we alone in the universe?
[00:38:08.207 --> 00:38:11.510]  And I tell you, I realize that aliens are real.
[00:38:12.435 --> 00:38:16.858]  We're creating thousands of different chimera cross-species on this planet.
[00:38:17.499 --> 00:38:25.025]  MIT reported this year on something I've been talking about for 20 years, because it was in the literature, it was in the medical literature, that they had facilities all over the world.
[00:38:25.445 --> 00:38:38.075]  Hong Kong came up a lot, China a lot, Costa Rica a lot, but now all over the U.S., where they're splicing humans and animals and then growing humanoids inside cows and sheep and goats and other things, and pigs, for organ harvesting.
[00:38:39.042 --> 00:38:48.671]  And they've made fun of me a lot in the media about this, even though you can just search part human, part animal chimeras, and you'll get the different medical papers and things, but they don't show it to people yet.
[00:38:49.172 --> 00:38:51.954]  Now they're getting ready to, and people say, well, what about animal testing?
[00:38:53.356 --> 00:38:57.680]  Well, these cows and other farm animals are part human, so they don't have rights.
[00:38:58.801 --> 00:39:02.865]  See, there's laws for humans and laws for animals, but not laws for
[00:39:04.735 --> 00:39:08.643]  Cross species, whether it be salmon or whether it be a human, a humanoid.
[00:39:09.642 --> 00:39:23.132]  And so these are aliens that have been created, and they... Media Matters, run by the White House and others, have done a bunch of articles making fun of us, and had hundreds of newspapers write about it, going, Jones is insane and says aliens are here, that humans have been crossed with animals, and then that's alien.
[00:39:23.152 --> 00:39:29.476]  Well, when they create truly AI, artificial intelligence, they already have artificially intelligent autonomous systems, but it's truly conscious.
[00:39:29.756 --> 00:39:33.059]  The question is, has Google already really become that, interfacing with billions of humans?
[00:39:33.139 --> 00:39:33.679]  I believe so.
[00:39:33.979 --> 00:39:34.560]  They believe so.
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:35.701]  They can now predict the future.
[00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:39.831]  Will true AI be alien?
[00:39:39.871 --> 00:39:40.952]  Yes, it's silicon.
[00:39:42.754 --> 00:39:44.475]  It would never develop naturally here.
[00:39:46.316 --> 00:39:47.597]  So yes, aliens are real.
[00:39:48.558 --> 00:39:54.502]  They're just not the 1950s type, you know, where they attack DC or Mars attacks in the 1990s.
[00:39:54.542 --> 00:39:56.103]  Don't run, we are your friends.
[00:39:57.845 --> 00:40:01.667]  No, I see it more like Pacific Rim, you know, interdimensional.
[00:40:01.928 --> 00:40:04.970]  There's so many different ways to look at this and George Noria gets folks thinking about it, but
[00:40:06.161 --> 00:40:07.362]  I want to get into the election with him.
[00:40:07.382 --> 00:40:08.483]  I know he's been covering that a lot.
[00:40:08.503 --> 00:40:09.784]  I want to get into the State of People Day.
[00:40:09.824 --> 00:40:11.405]  Why are people acting so whacked out?
[00:40:11.485 --> 00:40:12.646]  Mental illness is exploding.
[00:40:12.686 --> 00:40:13.346]  All this stuff's happening.
[00:40:13.526 --> 00:40:17.389]  People say they're so bored because people are near trance state.
[00:40:17.489 --> 00:40:18.410]  The medical facts show that.
[00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:19.491]  We'll get George's take on that.
[00:40:20.419 --> 00:40:26.300]  And we'll also talk about his big paranormal date site and his big St.
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:27.361]  Louis stage show coming up.
[00:40:27.401 --> 00:40:29.801]  I was at his big one in Toronto last year.
[00:40:29.821 --> 00:40:30.461]  That was a lot of fun.
[00:40:30.501 --> 00:40:31.182]  Or was it earlier this year?
[00:40:31.222 --> 00:40:31.642]  I forget.
[00:40:32.302 --> 00:40:34.963]  And so he joins us right now.
[00:40:35.343 --> 00:40:37.663]  George, that's quite the intro, as I tend to do.
[00:40:37.683 --> 00:40:38.763]  I run on at the mouth.
[00:40:39.104 --> 00:40:43.525]  First thing I want to ask you is, what is front and center on your mind, my friend?
[00:40:45.205 --> 00:40:48.906]  Well, first of all, Alex, good to be back with you on your show.
[00:40:50.269 --> 00:40:51.210]  It's good to have you.
[00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:53.471]  What do I have to do to get you to come on with us via Skype?
[00:40:55.572 --> 00:41:01.776]  Well, we've got to do it where I can get to my office, and then we can do it.
[00:41:01.816 --> 00:41:03.177]  How's the quality now?
[00:41:03.817 --> 00:41:12.903]  The phone's okay, it's cut down a little bit, but listen, we could at least, you could load Skype on your phone, and I'm not, I should have done this before the show, but let me just kiss your ring and say please do it.
[00:41:13.243 --> 00:41:18.486]  If you put Skype on your iPhone or whatever you've got, we could do audio Skype with you with headphones, it'd be so good, George.
[00:41:19.659 --> 00:41:20.880]  Okay, we should try that.
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:26.142]  I promise I will send you a key lime pie if you do it.
[00:41:29.904 --> 00:41:31.084]  What would you have in the pie?
[00:41:32.525 --> 00:41:33.025]  I don't know.
[00:41:34.026 --> 00:41:35.407]  A gorgeous, gorgeous female.
[00:41:36.567 --> 00:41:39.909]  But let me tell you Alex, so much is going on in this planet right now.
[00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:42.970]  It is absolutely unbelievable.
[00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:48.733]  Let's talk a little bit about the election first of all and what's happening now.
[00:41:51.203 --> 00:41:59.026]  Right now it looks like, obviously, Donald Trump is going to be the frontrunner for the Republicans, though I still think it's going to be a brokered convention there.
[00:41:59.726 --> 00:42:10.629]  And then we've got Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democrats, and there's so much under the table about what she is and who she is that the American public just does not know.
[00:42:11.949 --> 00:42:13.970]  There's not much going on out there at all.
[00:42:16.229 --> 00:42:21.011]  Possibilities are there because people are frustrated with everything.
[00:42:21.311 --> 00:42:21.672]  Everything.
[00:42:21.732 --> 00:42:27.474]  He may end up being a great nominee, but people just want to change.
[00:42:27.494 --> 00:42:36.259]  And I've never seen in my life more confusion and also more excitement about an election in all my life.
[00:42:36.359 --> 00:42:36.779]  How about you?
[00:42:39.465 --> 00:42:43.406]  Well, I mean, I agree with you that the system's trying to force-feed us.
[00:42:44.626 --> 00:42:47.487]  AP polls show 6% trust in mainstream media.
[00:42:47.807 --> 00:42:50.068]  Where is all this collapse in confidence going, George?
[00:42:52.928 --> 00:42:57.430]  It's growing out the window, because people are fed up with everything that's going on with America.
[00:42:57.490 --> 00:42:59.110]  They just don't trust government.
[00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:07.072]  You know, you sensed that many, many years ago when you started doing your programs, that you were way ahead of the curve.
[00:43:07.828 --> 00:43:09.850]  Um, we started picking up on that.
[00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:30.567]  We started, um, not downplaying the paranormal, which was a staple of Coast to Coast during, uh, Art Bell's days, but we realized, as you did, uh, when I started having you on as a guest, that this planet is changing and it's, you just can't do strange ghosts and things like that all the time.
[00:43:30.707 --> 00:43:36.532]  You know, it's still a staple of Coast to Coast, but things are affecting people, their lifestyle, their
[00:43:37.347 --> 00:43:44.953]  The way they live, their families, their income, their jobs, and they're frustrated.
[00:43:45.073 --> 00:43:56.761]  So we started the tweet, the Evolve Coast to Coast, much like you have tweeted InfoWars, the person planet, and it's become huge now.
[00:43:56.982 --> 00:44:04.907]  I mean, you talked about our audience, and thank you for the generosity there, but people are at a breaking point.
[00:44:06.414 --> 00:44:12.979]  It's our job, Alex, it's yours, it's mine, to make sure people stay calm during these very turbulent times.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:19.123]  Well, it is our job, George, and I want to, again, cover just a whole bunch of issues.
[00:44:19.163 --> 00:44:22.005]  Radical Islam with you, where you see the world going, earth changes.
[00:44:22.285 --> 00:44:24.687]  But first off, Washington, D.C.
[00:44:24.727 --> 00:44:32.692]  I'm going to put on screen behind me footage we've shot in D.C., the richest city probably in the world, and
[00:44:33.775 --> 00:44:46.166]  They are so insulated, the elite believe they're in their own world, and here's Dennis Hastert, former Speaker of the House, sentenced to only 15 months for raping all these young people, all these children.
[00:44:48.068 --> 00:44:51.011]  It's just over the top, and this just keeps popping up.
[00:44:52.108 --> 00:45:02.537]  Pedophilia in DC and just all these other forms of corruption and it turns out that he was recruited by Republican leadership to run for Congress to begin with out of nowhere.
[00:45:02.877 --> 00:45:06.740]  Which shows to me it's a pedophile guild above him.
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:13.085]  Look at the Catholic Church and all these other institutions that have been infested by these people.
[00:45:14.467 --> 00:45:16.108]  The corruption is intensifying.
[00:45:16.368 --> 00:45:18.170]  What do you think about the Hastert situation?
[00:45:19.258 --> 00:45:21.640]  Oh, absolutely disgusting.
[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:22.861]  Despicable.
[00:45:23.562 --> 00:45:26.384]  And, you know, it's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:45:26.484 --> 00:45:27.746]  We've heard stories.
[00:45:28.526 --> 00:45:32.009]  We haven't gone with on coast to coast because it's difficult to prove.
[00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:46.222]  But we've heard stories that some, you know, high officials go off on little junkets and trips and secret islands and covert with, you know, young people and children.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.642]  And it's deplorable to me.
[00:45:49.882 --> 00:45:51.203]  It's truly deplorable.
[00:45:51.523 --> 00:45:54.205]  And something's got to be done about this.
[00:45:54.305 --> 00:45:58.508]  You know, Pastor's sentence is minimal compared to his crime.
[00:45:59.488 --> 00:46:03.291]  And, you know, like you just say, what has happened?
[00:46:03.551 --> 00:46:05.332]  You know, I was raised a Catholic.
[00:46:06.233 --> 00:46:08.615]  Went to catechism classes every week.
[00:46:10.576 --> 00:46:13.118]  But I don't go to church like that anymore.
[00:46:13.138 --> 00:46:14.979]  I don't go to organized religion.
[00:46:15.609 --> 00:46:28.935]  Because what they did and how they did this has tainted me, and it's unfortunate because there are some wonderful priests out there who are God-loving, God-fearing, and care about people.
[00:46:30.362 --> 00:46:31.543]  But it's tainted everything.
[00:46:31.723 --> 00:46:42.347]  Sure, well that's how you take down institutions is getting corrupt people in place and then doling the news out that a bunch of pedophiles run the government and run the Catholic Church and run everything else basically.
[00:46:42.588 --> 00:46:44.008]  Then that finally brings it down.
[00:46:44.028 --> 00:46:47.550]  I mean this is really a well thought out plan to demoralize our country.
[00:46:48.908 --> 00:46:50.950]  Well, and it is demoralizing our country.
[00:46:50.970 --> 00:47:00.920]  I mean, you talk to anybody out there, and aside from people who care deeply about their own families, as we all do, most people are just upset.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:07.462]  Get Brain Force at 25% off for a limited time at Infowarslife.com.
[00:47:07.602 --> 00:47:09.783]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.903 --> 00:47:16.706]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:16.946 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.408]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.

[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.

[00:48:59.171 --> 00:49:05.775]  Donald Trump has a 97% chance of winning the Republican nomination even before the convention.
[00:49:13.516 --> 00:49:16.818]  And he will likely get enough delegates even if he loses Indiana.
[00:49:17.118 --> 00:49:24.263]  Meanwhile, the Trump train rolls on, and we take you now live to a Trump rally in Southern California.
[00:49:24.663 --> 00:49:27.925]  And we go now to Rob Due, Josh Owens, there at the scene.
[00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:28.506]  What's going on?
[00:49:29.826 --> 00:49:31.728]  That's right, Rob Due reporting for Infowars.com.
[00:49:31.748 --> 00:49:35.210]  We are in Costa Mesa, California, which is south of Long Beach.
[00:49:35.706 --> 00:49:37.287]  And we are at the Pacific Amphitheater.
[00:49:37.447 --> 00:49:38.628]  Holds about 8,500 people.
[00:49:38.928 --> 00:49:40.989]  Right now there's a large line going around this way.
[00:49:41.649 --> 00:49:50.735]  We came up here in a hurry and we just recorded some footage for you guys back at home of a disgruntled anti-Trump protester who was arguing with some people.
[00:49:51.435 --> 00:49:53.576]  And I guess he got it handed to him because he left.
[00:49:53.616 --> 00:49:54.977]  He ended up leaving without much of an incident.
[00:49:55.537 --> 00:49:57.359]  But it's definitely a lot of people here.
[00:49:57.379 --> 00:49:58.579]  We just arrived on scene.
[00:49:58.619 --> 00:50:01.481]  We flew out today about 1.30 from Austin.
[00:50:01.881 --> 00:50:03.222]  Got here, hit the ground, and
[00:50:04.085 --> 00:50:04.326]  I don't
[00:50:18.823 --> 00:50:22.705]  International sovereignty, building a wall, improving the economy.
[00:50:22.725 --> 00:50:23.605]  Some people don't like that.
[00:50:23.645 --> 00:50:24.346]  They don't want to hear that.
[00:50:24.926 --> 00:50:26.727]  So, go ahead, Darren, fire away.
[00:50:26.907 --> 00:50:40.974]  Well, I was just going to say, a lot of people, they're already suspecting that since it's Southern California that you're going to see a lot of Bernie supporters, you're going to see a lot of even Hillary Clinton supporters because it is a liberal state.
[00:50:41.455 --> 00:50:41.875]  However...
[00:50:42.415 --> 00:50:48.059]  However, I lived in California for many, many years and there's a lot of good old boys out there as well.
[00:50:48.119 --> 00:50:49.940]  I imagine there's a lot of Trump supporters.
[00:50:50.601 --> 00:50:57.105]  What are you seeing so far as far as the ratio between Trump, pro-Trump and anti-Trump agitators?
[00:50:58.046 --> 00:51:01.909]  I have yet to see any protesters except one or two that were at the front of the line.
[00:51:02.369 --> 00:51:06.572]  Right now you can see behind me they have metal detectors set up where they're slowly filing people through.
[00:51:07.093 --> 00:51:10.455]  But yeah, we just came up here because we saw people surrounding a group
[00:51:11.104 --> 00:51:15.127]  And we wanted to see what was going on and catch that on video.
[00:51:15.447 --> 00:51:19.070]  But right now, if you look, the line starts here, goes over this way.
[00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:22.492]  There's at least, you know, 300 people right around me now.
[00:51:22.952 --> 00:51:24.874]  The line stretches down the parking lot.
[00:51:25.254 --> 00:51:26.455]  Hey, what do you think about all this right now?
[00:51:26.475 --> 00:51:28.196]  I think it's racist.
[00:51:28.596 --> 00:51:28.897]  Yeah?
[00:51:29.337 --> 00:51:30.278]  It's really racist.
[00:51:31.138 --> 00:51:32.839]  But then again, what are we going to do?
[00:51:32.879 --> 00:51:33.980]  Just look at all the people.
[00:51:34.581 --> 00:51:35.341]  It's pretty funny.
[00:51:35.822 --> 00:51:36.442]  It's hilarious.
[00:51:36.882 --> 00:51:37.643]  Yeah, we were laughing.
[00:51:37.863 --> 00:51:38.944]  Yeah.
[00:51:39.004 --> 00:51:39.384]  It's great.
[00:51:39.404 --> 00:51:40.685]  Are you guys going in to see Trump?
[00:51:41.141 --> 00:51:41.341]  Yes.
[00:51:42.462 --> 00:51:44.163]  It's going to be the best stand-up act ever.
[00:51:44.504 --> 00:51:45.084]  Yeah, you think so?
[00:51:45.144 --> 00:51:45.344]  Yeah.
[00:51:45.845 --> 00:51:50.308]  It's kind of funny how, like, we're 2016, but how very primitive people are.
[00:51:51.149 --> 00:51:52.770]  It's like, it's like... We've devolved.
[00:51:53.470 --> 00:52:04.979]  Exactly, because you think in the 1960s, Martin Luther King would have, like, put an end to all this, but we're going backwards, and if, well, if frickin' Trump becomes president, it's over.
[00:52:05.219 --> 00:52:06.861]  Martin Luther King was a Republican.
[00:52:07.121 --> 00:52:09.923]  Maybe to start with something, but... You know, Martin Luther King was a Republican.
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:11.420]  Yes, I know that.
[00:52:13.322 --> 00:52:15.843]  It is funny to see people acting like this.
[00:52:17.264 --> 00:52:19.766]  But these people just are showing up here to come see Trump.
[00:52:19.946 --> 00:52:21.547]  There are other people coming here agitating them.
[00:52:21.567 --> 00:52:22.387]  What do you think of those people?
[00:52:24.008 --> 00:52:25.850]  It goes to primitive on both sides.
[00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:26.090]  Yeah.
[00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:33.815]  Because there's no really need to be here because they know they're going to instigate something that might turn out to be worse.
[00:52:34.115 --> 00:52:34.375]  Right.
[00:52:34.795 --> 00:52:35.276]  It's not going to...
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:43.322]  It's not going to stop them doing what they're going to do today to support Trump.
[00:52:44.643 --> 00:52:50.647]  So, no matter who's doing anything, it's not going to... We're getting a chance to build the wall right now.
[00:52:50.847 --> 00:52:56.070]  Obviously, people in Southern California are pissed about what's going on, I guess, with the illegal immigration here.
[00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:59.612]  What is your opinion on illegal immigration?
[00:53:01.353 --> 00:53:06.756]  Well, my opinion, because I'm Native American, so our ancestors have always been here.
[00:53:06.956 --> 00:53:07.136]  Right.
[00:53:09.116 --> 00:53:10.577]  Everybody's illegal.
[00:53:11.417 --> 00:53:17.419]  And even from Mexico, people from Europe, people from Africa, people from the Middle East.
[00:53:17.439 --> 00:53:21.380]  But that's part of the evolution process, coming up with borders and having countries and nation states.
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:24.181]  You know, a lot of the Constitution was based off the Iroquois.
[00:53:25.002 --> 00:53:25.242]  Yes.
[00:53:25.662 --> 00:53:26.482]  I wasn't aware of that.
[00:53:27.582 --> 00:53:28.503]  Iroquois Confederacy.
[00:53:29.543 --> 00:53:34.205]  But to me, I have nothing against the immigrants, because they're not doing anything to hurt me.
[00:53:35.105 --> 00:53:37.886]  And this, people just need to
[00:53:38.476 --> 00:53:39.016]  Love each other.
[00:53:39.036 --> 00:53:40.237]  That's the thing.
[00:53:40.257 --> 00:53:41.738]  Alright man, thanks a lot.
[00:53:41.778 --> 00:53:43.300]  Thanks a lot for talking with us.
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:47.423]  Okay, it looks like some people are, their slow agitators are moving in.
[00:53:48.043 --> 00:53:51.846]  And, uh, looks like these guys probably are.
[00:53:53.067 --> 00:53:58.811]  So... Darren, it's a very interesting scene.
[00:53:58.851 --> 00:54:05.256]  There's no set up... There's no set up, uh... I don't see any protests set up over here yet, but there...
[00:54:05.723 --> 00:54:06.984]  Small contingent of cops.
[00:54:07.064 --> 00:54:10.305]  They said about 500 people were going to be here, so I'm not sure what's going to happen.
[00:54:10.325 --> 00:54:19.609]  I mean, we just got on the ground, ran out, and put on our Skype gear to get to this report so we could send you guys a message back home and see what was going on.
[00:54:19.629 --> 00:54:20.810]  Do you have any other questions?
[00:54:21.277 --> 00:54:23.098]  Well, I was just, I was going to make a comment.
[00:54:23.438 --> 00:54:30.380]  I bet you there would be a lot less protesters and agitators if Trump would have these rallies at like 11 o'clock in the morning.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:35.081]  Because most of these guys, you know, they don't, even though they don't have jobs, they stay up.
[00:54:35.121 --> 00:54:35.461]  That's right.
[00:54:35.481 --> 00:54:39.383]  They stay up playing Xbox, getting high until, you know, two o'clock, three o'clock in the morning.
[00:54:39.823 --> 00:54:41.803]  And then, you know, they sleep until noon.
[00:54:41.883 --> 00:54:46.865]  So, hey, when's the last time you ever seen, saw a riot before noon, for example?
[00:54:47.532 --> 00:54:48.032]  Exactly.
[00:54:48.212 --> 00:54:54.614]  And you know, what was interesting, I was at a convenience store getting some water and there was a guy getting a couple beers and he had a megaphone with him.
[00:54:54.854 --> 00:54:56.294]  And I said, I said, where are you going?
[00:54:56.314 --> 00:54:59.015]  He goes, Oh, there's some guy coming into town.
[00:54:59.035 --> 00:55:00.915]  I got to go make myself be heard.
[00:55:01.575 --> 00:55:03.716]  So I thought that was pretty interesting.
[00:55:03.836 --> 00:55:05.176]  I imagine he was talking about Trump.
[00:55:05.236 --> 00:55:07.257]  I was just a mile down the road from here.
[00:55:07.857 --> 00:55:08.697]  So we'll see.
[00:55:08.717 --> 00:55:11.297]  I haven't seen too, uh, there's no loud contingent of protesters.
[00:55:11.317 --> 00:55:13.418]  It looks like there's small little groups mingling in.
[00:55:14.874 --> 00:55:17.635]  You just got there, so I'm sure you're going to get lots of good footage.
[00:55:17.695 --> 00:55:24.299]  I want to remind everyone to this evening and tomorrow, be sure to check out the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:30.643]  And you know, it was interesting, that guy that you were talking to earlier, he said it's ridiculous seeing people acting like this.
[00:55:31.084 --> 00:55:31.864]  Acting like what?
[00:55:32.164 --> 00:55:35.306]  They're going to see a presidential candidate make a speech.
[00:55:35.626 --> 00:55:36.987]  What's so ridiculous about that?
[00:55:38.888 --> 00:55:39.349]  Exactly.
[00:55:39.449 --> 00:55:41.770]  Well, some of these people obviously have a problem with it.
[00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:43.211]  Hey, are you guys here to protest Trump?
[00:55:43.951 --> 00:55:44.071]  Sorry?
[00:55:44.091 --> 00:55:45.512]  Are you guys protesting Trump?
[00:55:45.752 --> 00:55:47.153]  Yeah, we're opposing Trump.
[00:55:47.173 --> 00:55:47.853]  You're opposing Trump?
[00:55:48.134 --> 00:55:48.814]  And why is that?
[00:55:49.494 --> 00:55:55.958]  Because I believe that strong communities will make police and politicians obsolete.
[00:55:56.018 --> 00:55:59.200]  We need to take our power back as individuals, as communities.
[00:55:59.601 --> 00:56:09.567]  We need to stop giving it away to these politicians, to the police that we have guarding us everywhere, that are murdering our people all over in every community, all across the nation.
[00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:11.571]  Okay, this is why.
[00:56:12.091 --> 00:56:15.975]  Strong communities make police and politicians obsolete.
[00:56:16.135 --> 00:56:16.995]  And what does that start with?
[00:56:17.015 --> 00:56:18.116]  Excuse me?
[00:56:18.256 --> 00:56:19.818]  That starts with strong families, doesn't it?
[00:56:19.938 --> 00:56:20.558]  Exactly.
[00:56:21.279 --> 00:56:22.980]  Strong families, strong people.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:28.445]  We need to unite and create strength amongst ourselves and stop giving our f***ing power away.
[00:56:29.566 --> 00:56:30.286]  That was very interesting.
[00:56:30.306 --> 00:56:39.934]  So, talking about strong communities, I think one way to have strong communities is for people to have more of their disposable income to themselves and not being taxed to death on social programs that they don't want or don't use.
[00:56:40.543 --> 00:56:43.885]  And I think that's one way you combat having weak communities.
[00:56:43.945 --> 00:56:45.506]  And another thing is having strong families.
[00:56:46.227 --> 00:56:58.514]  And, you know, I can't say it for the Republican Party, but I think conservatives and libertarians in general are more pro-family than, say, the Democrat Party, who's more interested in giving women the right to terminate their unborn children.
[00:56:59.135 --> 00:57:00.776]  Hey, dude, where is this being held at?
[00:57:00.796 --> 00:57:02.837]  You said it's in Costa Mesa, but where exactly?
[00:57:02.857 --> 00:57:03.477]  At the amphitheater?
[00:57:03.497 --> 00:57:04.318]  Yes, the Pacific Amphitheater.
[00:57:04.338 --> 00:57:05.159]  Pacific Amphitheater.
[00:57:05.299 --> 00:57:06.740]  It's called the Pacific Amphitheater.
[00:57:08.334 --> 00:57:12.419]  There's a view of the Pacific Ocean just beyond this wall, this little fence area over here.
[00:57:13.179 --> 00:57:14.801]  And so, yeah, people are lining up.
[00:57:14.821 --> 00:57:16.043]  They just now opened the gates.
[00:57:16.763 --> 00:57:17.844]  It starts at 7 p.m.
[00:57:17.885 --> 00:57:19.386]  Central, or 7 p.m.
[00:57:19.847 --> 00:57:21.348]  Pacific, so it'll be 9 p.m.
[00:57:21.368 --> 00:57:21.689]  Central.
[00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.710]  And we're gonna be here.
[00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:29.357]  I might get on, if things get pretty wild, I'll turn it on Facebook Mentions and start broadcasting live.
[00:57:30.794 --> 00:57:32.896]  Okay, well we look forward to checking it out.
[00:57:32.976 --> 00:57:37.640]  I'm sure it's going to get quite heated and you're going to see some good exchanges like you guys always do.
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:39.562]  Yeah, we just got a triggering event.
[00:57:39.922 --> 00:57:40.442]  Uh-oh.
[00:57:40.743 --> 00:57:41.283]  Trigger alert.
[00:57:41.503 --> 00:57:41.944]  Trigger alert.
[00:57:41.984 --> 00:57:42.784]  Trigger alert right here.
[00:57:43.565 --> 00:57:45.647]  Guy said, Hillary for prison.
[00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:51.452]  So that definitely triggered him right there.
[00:57:51.512 --> 00:57:53.473]  The lady I was just talking about, the strong communities.
[00:57:53.493 --> 00:57:55.215]  I don't think Hillary's interested in strong communities.
[00:57:55.575 --> 00:57:57.637]  She's interested in people being beholden to the government.
[00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:58.291]  Absolutely.
[00:57:58.351 --> 00:58:00.594]  And for bigger government, just as Bernie Sanders is.
[00:58:00.754 --> 00:58:08.404]  These people come out here and they want to talk about strong communities and this and that, but you're not going to get that with these Democratic policies.
[00:58:08.424 --> 00:58:13.131]  You're just going to get more social programs that lead to more taxes and less human freedom.
[00:58:13.803 --> 00:58:19.832]  Well, hopefully some of them will get to go inside the amphitheater and maybe learn a thing or two from Donald Trump himself.
[00:58:20.173 --> 00:58:28.045]  Dude, we're out of time, but again, everybody check out the YouTube channel, the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube, and we'll look forward to more reports.
[00:58:28.732 --> 00:58:34.696]  That's right, Rob Dew signing off from the West Coast of California at Costa Mesa, just outside the Pacific Amphitheater.
[00:58:34.796 --> 00:58:35.216]  Thank you, Darren.
[00:58:35.357 --> 00:58:35.957]  Y'all have fun.
[00:58:36.297 --> 00:58:38.559]  All right, folks, that's going to do it for tonight's broadcast.
[00:58:38.599 --> 00:58:43.782]  EM4's Nightly News will return, Lord willing, tomorrow night at 7 o'clock p.m.
[00:58:43.942 --> 00:58:44.923]  Central Time.
[00:58:45.263 --> 00:58:46.964]  Until then, y'all have a great evening.
[00:58:47.225 --> 00:58:48.465]  We'll see you back here tomorrow.
[00:58:48.706 --> 00:58:48.946]  Good night.
[00:59:03.843 --> 00:59:05.004]  Knockout is back.
