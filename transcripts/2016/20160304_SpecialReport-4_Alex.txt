[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:26.899]  Si Hirsch has revealed in his latest offering titled Military to Military that while Obama continued his campaign of lies regarding President Bashar al-Assad's tenuous hold on power, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were altering the playing field with shared intelligence.
[00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.441]  Do I think that our actions in any way violate the War Powers Resolution?
[00:00:48.573 --> 00:00:49.173]  The answer is no.
[00:00:49.413 --> 00:01:02.717]  President Obama and then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's failed foreign policy aimed at toppling Qaddafi's Libya and Morsi's Egypt resulted in a power vacuum immediately filled with Islamic fundamental extremism.
[00:01:02.897 --> 00:01:11.980]  Obama's constant demand that Assad must go chaotically echoed the previous coups and if accomplished could give the Islamic State the upper hand in the region.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.961]  Do you know any major Arab ally that embraces ISIL?
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.581]  I know major Arab allies who fund them.
[00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:24.503]  General Dempsey and the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided that Obama's meddling in the Middle East had to be countered.
[00:01:24.624 --> 00:01:30.886]  The Joint Chiefs of Staff quietly shared intelligence with key allies in order to give Syria the tactical advantage.
[00:01:31.106 --> 00:01:34.167]  However, Syria had to agree to these four terms.
[00:01:34.507 --> 00:01:38.569]  Sy Hersh writes, First, Assad must keep Hezbollah from attacking Israel.
[00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.571]  Second, he must renew negotiations with Israel on the Golan Heights.
[00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:47.074]  Third, he must accept Russian and other outside military advisors.
[00:01:47.234 --> 00:01:52.677]  And fourth, he must commit to holding open elections after the war with a wide range of factions.
[00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:59.601]  Assad essentially agreed to these conditions over time, and that led to major shifts in the war that are generally now known to the public.
[00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:08.763]  Meanwhile, the Obama administration was touting the narrative that an anti-Islamic state coalition with Russia would prove to be impossible and non-beneficial.
[00:02:08.903 --> 00:02:22.607]  However, by allying with Russian military, General Dempsey and the Joint Chiefs of Staff proved that not only was a coalition possible, the shared knowledge of the Islamic State between Russia and the United States would serve to weaken their advance into Syria.
[00:02:22.747 --> 00:02:27.869]  Russia had been fighting Islamic State leaders in the two Chechen Wars that began in 1994, and they were very familiar
[00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:29.529]  I don't know.
[00:02:53.692 --> 00:03:03.996]  To this day, retired General Dempsey is perplexed by Obama's bold-faced lie that Turkey's Erdogan is a staunch ally with the United States in the fight against the Islamic State.
[00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:18.182]  Cy Hirsch writes, Dempsey and his associates remained mystified by Obama's continued public defense of Erdogan, given the American intelligence community's strong case against him and the evidence that Obama, in private, accepts that case.
[00:03:18.502 --> 00:03:25.643]  Hirsch wrote last spring, Obama said to Turkey's intelligence chief, we know what you're doing with the radicals in Syria.
[00:03:25.803 --> 00:03:38.205]  After Dempsey retired in September, General Dunford and an entirely new and obedient staff was installed to back up all of Obama's lies, as is evident by their communal hatred of Donald Trump.
[00:03:38.305 --> 00:03:47.067]  Cy Hirsch has presented nothing less than another testament to Obama's pitiful leadership of the US military built upon a pile of half-baked falsehoods
[00:03:47.347 --> 00:03:52.561]  Now proven without a shadow of a doubt to be treasonous support for the Islamic State.
[00:03:52.701 --> 00:03:54.526]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:04:03.331 --> 00:04:09.437]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:12.820]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.521]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!

[00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:26.812]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?

[00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:41.978]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.

[00:04:44.359 --> 00:04:45.400]  It's a war against the truth.
