[00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:21.966]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.026 --> 00:00:25.729]  It is Friday, September 16, 2016, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.990]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:30.353 --> 00:00:38.299]  Tonight, President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.
[00:00:39.144 --> 00:00:43.889]  Donald Trump says Barack Obama was born in the USA.
[00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.353]  Yet the birth certificate is no doubt a forgery.
[00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:54.962]  And that's because the establishment does not want the world to know the true identity of Obama's real father.
[00:00:56.394 --> 00:01:05.577]  Then, the mainstream media is outraged with Donald Trump as he tricks them into covering his military endorsements.
[00:01:06.357 --> 00:01:10.878]  And look who just bought the most evil corporation in the world.
[00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:19.981]  Drug and crop chemical maker Bayer just purchased Monsanto Corporation for a measly $66 billion.
[00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:25.243]  All that plus much more up next on the Info Wars Nightly News.

[00:03:04.688 --> 00:03:16.333]  Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy.
[00:03:16.354 --> 00:03:17.494]  I finished it.
[00:03:18.374 --> 00:03:19.035]  I finished it.
[00:03:19.135 --> 00:03:19.855]  You know what I mean.
[00:03:20.996 --> 00:03:27.779]  President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.
[00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:36.447]  Now, we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.
[00:03:37.534 --> 00:03:40.717]  Well, that was Donald Trump epically trolling the media.
[00:03:40.797 --> 00:03:43.178]  He had them all standing around with bated breath.
[00:03:43.218 --> 00:03:49.944]  They gave him 20 minutes of live coverage, just sitting there waiting to feed into this birther narrative.
[00:03:50.004 --> 00:03:51.565]  What's he going to say this time around?
[00:03:52.085 --> 00:04:02.173]  And of course, he took the opportunity to give one more jab to Hillary Clinton to remind everyone that it was her and her aides that were the ones who first started this whole birther controversy.
[00:04:02.594 --> 00:04:03.314]  And then he said,
[00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:06.976]  As a finality, Obama was born in the U.S.
[00:04:07.036 --> 00:04:07.436]  Goodbye.
[00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:08.296]  That was it.
[00:04:08.336 --> 00:04:09.317]  About 30 seconds.
[00:04:10.057 --> 00:04:18.059]  And since yesterday, the media has been trying to discredit Trump, bringing up these birther claims, and so he was hitting back at the media and their attempts to discredit him.
[00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.940]  He said, you know, Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy.
[00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:27.643]  And now let's take a little flashback to 2008.
[00:04:28.223 --> 00:04:40.089]  We actually had Chris Matthews doing a report on Hillary Clinton reporting on these birther issues and that her beleaguered staff were circulating this picture of Obama dressed in Muslim garb.
[00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:42.070]  This is out of The Guardian in February of 2008.
[00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:47.133]  Clinton aides claim Obama photo wasn't intended as a smear.
[00:04:47.813 --> 00:04:59.340]  And this was Barack Obama's campaign accusing Hillary Clinton's staff of mounting a desperate, dirty trick operation by circulating a picture of him in African dress, feeding into these false claims on U.S.
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.940]  websites that he is a Muslim.
[00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:08.345]  His campaign manager at the time said, this is the most shameful, offensive, fear-mongering we've seen from either party in this election.
[00:05:08.965 --> 00:05:14.109]  Clinton initially tried to brush everything off but then they flat out denied having anything to do with it.
[00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:26.397]  This picture first showed up on the Drudge Report in 2006 and the site said, the Drudge Report said it was circulated by Clinton's staffers and quoted one as saying,
[00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:32.775]  Indeed.
[00:05:33.215 --> 00:05:34.776]  So, this is what Donald Trump is saying.
[00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:36.696]  You know, guys, circle back around.
[00:05:36.776 --> 00:05:39.897]  You'll recall that it was actually Hillary who started this whole birther movement.
[00:05:40.218 --> 00:05:45.879]  But the fact is, why has this been the top story on CNN all day?
[00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.041]  Since yesterday, for like 15 hours, they're milking this birther thing.
[00:05:50.281 --> 00:05:50.861]  Who cares?
[00:05:51.181 --> 00:05:53.342]  Obama is almost out of the office.
[00:05:53.442 --> 00:05:56.443]  He'll be out of the presidency in just a few months.
[00:05:56.903 --> 00:05:57.844]  Why does this matter?
[00:05:57.864 --> 00:06:02.248]  There are so many more important things going on in America that people should be focusing on.
[00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:10.317]  Like I said, Trump is the consummate troll, and he trolled the media for 20 minutes.
[00:06:10.717 --> 00:06:13.239]  They were just waiting there with the cameras, giving them live coverage.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.001]  We're good to go.
[00:06:36.994 --> 00:06:40.216]  Hashtag text Trump to, you know, the number there.
[00:06:40.816 --> 00:06:46.019]  And then so they're just giving him all this free advertising, all this positive coverage.
[00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:49.120]  And then he comes out and makes his 30 second statement.
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.242]  And let me just tell you, the press weren't having it.
[00:06:52.342 --> 00:06:54.563]  They realized it was the ultimate rick roll.
[00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:58.641]  Still getting introduced by members of the military.
[00:06:58.882 --> 00:07:06.388]  To be clear, we have been told this event would be an event where Donald Trump would address his past trafficking in the Bertha issue.
[00:07:06.708 --> 00:07:12.934]  Five years of Bertha conspiracy to promote his hotel, but now we have been listening to veterans and military officials praising Donald Trump.
[00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:16.437]  It's hard to imagine this is anything other than a political rickroll.
[00:07:17.117 --> 00:07:19.600]  It feels like he's treating this like a game.
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.342]  He believes Barack Obama was born in the United States.
[00:07:22.802 --> 00:07:23.163]  Period.
[00:07:23.956 --> 00:07:24.577]  There you have it.
[00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:42.957]  Yes.
[00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:00.600]  We're good to go.
[00:08:21.921 --> 00:08:22.743]  I'm good.
[00:08:35.939 --> 00:08:38.261]  Come out and openly support Trump.
[00:08:38.721 --> 00:08:41.043]  Now I want to talk about the article that's in the Military Times.
[00:08:41.123 --> 00:08:44.385]  It says 14 Medal of Honor recipients have endorsed Trump.
[00:08:44.645 --> 00:08:48.508]  And one of those is retired Master Sergeant Lee Roy Petrie of the U.S.
[00:08:48.648 --> 00:08:48.888]  Army.
[00:08:49.188 --> 00:08:52.431]  He was awarded this for his heroism in Afghanistan.
[00:08:52.811 --> 00:09:00.316]  Now there's also 11 Vietnam veterans and two Marines who earned their respective medals for actions in the Korean War and World War II.
[00:09:01.337 --> 00:09:04.240]  In a statement, Trump called the endorsements a tremendous honor.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.702]  These soldiers are the personification of courage under fire.
[00:09:08.043 --> 00:09:09.624]  They are the best of us all.
[00:09:10.565 --> 00:09:17.310]  I thank each of these Medal of Honor recipients for their faith in me to serve as our next Commander-in-Chief and President.
[00:09:17.651 --> 00:09:20.473]  So that's a huge endorsement for Trump and his campaign.
[00:09:20.713 --> 00:09:22.875]  Stay tuned for more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:23.696]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:30.885]  How do you feel about the fact that a good portion of your food is now going to be produced by Big Pharma?
[00:09:31.225 --> 00:09:31.705]  That's right.
[00:09:31.765 --> 00:09:37.209]  They're going to feed you frankenfoods and then be able to cure your diseases from them afterward.
[00:09:37.229 --> 00:09:40.010]  It's actually a great arrangement and a vicious cycle.
[00:09:40.451 --> 00:09:41.691]  Ashley Beckford joins me now.
[00:09:42.012 --> 00:09:45.114]  What do you think about this outrageous announcement?
[00:09:45.434 --> 00:09:46.835]  In my opinion, it's pretty outrageous.
[00:09:46.915 --> 00:09:49.917]  Bayer clinches the deal with Monsanto for $66 billion.
[00:09:52.398 --> 00:09:55.420]  Well, I believe it's really atrocious, Leanne.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:01.724]  The really sick part about this is that this is actually a part of their global eugenics scheme.
[00:10:02.084 --> 00:10:11.649]  We know that Bayer are actually Nazi collaborators and they haven't stopped since the Nazi times in going for their eugenics plan.
[00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:17.613]  And I believe this is just another step in their control to, you know, controlling the whole global food supply.
[00:10:17.773 --> 00:10:18.573]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:18.914 --> 00:10:20.694]  Because really the deal doesn't even make sense.
[00:10:20.755 --> 00:10:27.878]  A lot of the shareholders are concerned that they've paid way too much money and that they're going to jeopardize their pharmaceutical company.
[00:10:28.458 --> 00:10:33.801]  And they say they're paying 16 times Monsanto's forecast core earnings for 2017.
[00:10:33.921 --> 00:10:34.161]  Wow.
[00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:38.684]  So for me it's kind of like, what do they have up their sleeve?
[00:10:38.724 --> 00:10:40.224]  What do they know is coming down the pipeline?
[00:10:40.545 --> 00:10:42.386]  Now obviously we know that there have
[00:10:43.206 --> 00:10:53.109]  There's been suggestions that they might be putting vaccines in genetically modified bananas and fruits and things like that to be able to give vaccines through the food supply in the future.
[00:10:53.129 --> 00:10:54.809]  So obviously we know that's coming.
[00:10:55.309 --> 00:11:05.112]  We see, you know, modified mosquitoes and then, of course, having to counteract the Zika virus, which is patented by the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds.
[00:11:05.152 --> 00:11:08.333]  I mean, it's just so insane how far this goes back.
[00:11:08.393 --> 00:11:11.134]  It's so deep that most people new to this
[00:11:12.008 --> 00:11:14.069]  Probably think we would sound kind of crazy.
[00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:21.693]  And you can even go back several decades ago, Bayer was actually knowingly selling drugs tainted with the AIDS virus.
[00:11:22.013 --> 00:11:29.057]  They couldn't, once they found out their AIDS virus is here in their product in the US, they, you know, they can't sell it, but they don't want to throw it away and lose all that money.
[00:11:29.437 --> 00:11:32.019]  So they sell it to Africa, France, other countries.
[00:11:32.379 --> 00:11:35.480]  And of course, it did make the mainstream media coverage.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.761]  This really, truly happened.
[00:11:37.041 --> 00:11:38.162]  Let's go ahead and take a look.
[00:11:39.076 --> 00:11:50.752]  The FDA helped to cover for pharmaceutical companies that knowingly sold millions of dollars worth of contaminated medicine to other countries in the mid-80s, although they knew that it was tainted with AIDS.
[00:11:51.309 --> 00:12:01.735]  Internal documents show that after this company positively, absolutely knew that they had a medication that was infected with the AIDS virus, they took the product off the market in the U.S.
[00:12:01.755 --> 00:12:04.717]  and then they dumped it in France, Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
[00:12:05.097 --> 00:12:06.658]  The medicine's called Factor 8.
[00:12:06.738 --> 00:12:11.461]  It was an injection medicine that was used for hemophiliacs, mostly children.
[00:12:11.601 --> 00:12:13.522]  Children had been born with an incurable disease.
[00:12:13.562 --> 00:12:14.182]  Hold on, hold on, Mike.
[00:12:14.343 --> 00:12:14.983]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:12:15.103 --> 00:12:25.515]  So you're telling me that Bayer knew that this drug was infected with the AIDS virus, they yanked it from the market in America, and then they dumped it in markets overseas?
[00:12:25.855 --> 00:12:30.721]  They had to figure out a way, Joe, to make a profit on a product that they could not sell in America.
[00:12:31.647 --> 00:12:37.469]  So this is Bayer, who we are now going to be trusting with a very large portion of the world's food supply.
[00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.609]  Right, Leigh-Anne.
[00:12:38.649 --> 00:12:45.091]  It's really, really disturbing and it's really, really scary because this is all about blood money when it comes to Bayer.
[00:12:45.832 --> 00:12:51.974]  Back in the day, you know, about three decades ago, back in the 70s and 80s, they had this Factor VIII.
[00:12:52.034 --> 00:12:55.975]  They knew that all they had to do was actually heat treat the product.
[00:12:56.315 --> 00:13:01.637]  And they wouldn't have so many age transmissions through hemophiliacs using that product.
[00:13:01.997 --> 00:13:06.138]  I have an article here from PubMed that kind of summarizes it.
[00:13:06.478 --> 00:13:20.742]  And then also Mercola recently did a story about 10 years ago just going back into how they actually went through creating a better product in the US back in February 1984.
[00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:28.804]  And even though the dangers of the drug were well known domestically, the news was actually slower to reach other parts of the world.
[00:13:29.144 --> 00:13:32.545]  So what they did was they continued to sell it, as you said.
[00:13:32.565 --> 00:13:42.107]  At least in Hong Kong and Taiwan alone, more than 100 people were infected with HIV and AIDS, and they later ended up dying.
[00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:49.829]  The worldwide numbers are really difficult to calculate, but I remember back when I was in high school or middle school,
[00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:54.552]  Ryan White, he was one of the famous people who actually died.
[00:13:54.612 --> 00:13:55.612]  He was a teenager.
[00:13:55.953 --> 00:14:05.878]  We had to watch the Ryan White story in our health course just to learn about how he actually, you know, ended up getting HIV from this Factor VIII.
[00:14:06.219 --> 00:14:08.620]  And it's really sick that they've never apologized.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:18.326]  They've had to pay only $600 million for all the people, the countless lives that they've destroyed, not just the people they killed, but the families that were ripped apart and destroyed.
[00:14:18.707 --> 00:14:20.702]  From this, and it's really, really shocking.
[00:14:21.089 --> 00:14:22.049]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:28.973]  And John Rappaport does some amazing reporting on this type of stuff, but he's basically saying, you know, the Empire strikes back.
[00:14:29.373 --> 00:14:35.536]  Of course, George Soros, Warren Buffett are set to make a fortune off of this merger.
[00:14:35.716 --> 00:14:35.956]  Wow.
[00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:41.238]  But this is just, I mean, a giant step in the direction of controlling the world's food supply.
[00:14:41.278 --> 00:14:48.161]  I mean, they're going to be controlling these seeds, but this is also GMOs, crop seeds, pesticides, medical drugs.
[00:14:48.321 --> 00:14:48.502]  Wow.
[00:14:49.662 --> 00:14:55.246]  This is huge, and these are obviously consultants there with the Rothschild Group.
[00:14:56.046 --> 00:15:00.910]  It's just a huge monopoly, and I don't think people really understand that this is super serious.
[00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:05.693]  They don't care about making sure you're getting healthy, delicious, and nutritious food.
[00:15:06.093 --> 00:15:16.320]  Clearly, they would willingly sell people drugs infected with the HIV-AIDS virus, and most of the time, that drug was going to children.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:16.820]  Right.
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.081]  Children were using this.
[00:15:18.201 --> 00:15:18.681]  Exactly.
[00:15:18.701 --> 00:15:19.421]  And they knew it.
[00:15:19.441 --> 00:15:21.142]  Yeah, that's what happened to Ryan White.
[00:15:21.182 --> 00:15:26.125]  I believe he was, you know, a middle schooler at that time when he got the HIV infection.
[00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:31.908]  And it just goes to show you, how can we trust the food supply with Nazi collaborators?
[00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:35.571]  This is all part of their global eugenics plan.
[00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:36.971]  It's never stopped.
[00:15:37.051 --> 00:15:38.352]  It's never going to stop.
[00:15:38.592 --> 00:15:44.416]  They've always had the same plan for a very, very long time, for decades, and maybe even centuries.
[00:15:44.456 --> 00:15:44.916]  Who knows?
[00:15:45.376 --> 00:15:46.077]  With these people.
[00:15:46.117 --> 00:15:59.670]  And then when you add in Monsanto and their plan to basically destroy people's just general independence, food independence, and just the organic, natural, it almost makes you think that they might be demons.
[00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:00.411]  No, I know.
[00:16:00.431 --> 00:16:00.791]  What is this?
[00:16:00.911 --> 00:16:01.752]  It's really sick.
[00:16:01.812 --> 00:16:02.753]  It's very bizarre.
[00:16:02.813 --> 00:16:06.216]  You just think how in the heck could something like this actually happen?
[00:16:06.236 --> 00:16:09.740]  And what people really need to be concerned about is this Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.162]  Because there is global rebellion.
[00:16:12.362 --> 00:16:21.471]  So many countries have actually banned GMOs, they've banned Monsanto products from coming into their countries, trying to do things a healthy way, because they can see the writing on the wall that this is not good.
[00:16:22.012 --> 00:16:28.599]  But with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, if the TPP passes, they are going to have these corporate tribunals that will basically be set up.
[00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:31.281]  They're going to take over the adjudication of disputes.
[00:16:31.662 --> 00:16:32.442]  So if a nation
[00:16:33.063 --> 00:16:33.303]  I don't know.
[00:16:57.949 --> 00:17:00.050]  That's what I was going to say.
[00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:05.953]  That's insane that they actually have a plan to be able to override national sovereignty.
[00:17:05.993 --> 00:17:07.994]  That seems like it's a big part of it as well.
[00:17:08.254 --> 00:17:08.494]  Right.
[00:17:08.574 --> 00:17:14.677]  So you think these tribunals are going to favor you and I or are they going to favor these mega corporate interests?
[00:17:14.757 --> 00:17:15.657]  Oh, they're definitely going to.
[00:17:15.677 --> 00:17:16.658]  Multinational corporations.
[00:17:17.418 --> 00:17:23.102]  A merger involving Bayer, Monsanto, of course Dow and DuPont, Syngenta and ChemChina.
[00:17:23.723 --> 00:17:24.443]  It's insane.
[00:17:24.804 --> 00:17:28.346]  We have huge mergers of corporations that are now going to be in control.
[00:17:28.366 --> 00:17:29.187]  It's a total global takeover.
[00:17:29.787 --> 00:17:31.829]  Ashley Beckford, thank you so much for joining me.
[00:17:31.949 --> 00:17:37.333]  Everybody, you've got to make sure that we push back against the passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:17:37.353 --> 00:17:42.176]  This is going to have major ramifications for the entire world for the coming future.
[00:17:42.196 --> 00:17:42.797]  Call your legislators.
[00:17:52.987 --> 00:18:02.555]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:18:03.016 --> 00:18:04.737]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:05.478]  Think about it.
[00:18:05.698 --> 00:18:11.463]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:17.288]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:18:17.668 --> 00:18:29.439]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:18:29.699 --> 00:18:32.481]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:18:32.661 --> 00:18:35.144]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:18:35.464 --> 00:18:39.928]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:18:40.348 --> 00:18:40.909]  Think about it.
[00:18:41.109 --> 00:18:52.297]  This is Darren McBreen and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and listen to the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on in your mind.
[00:19:01.496 --> 00:19:04.659]  In the last 20 years, InfoWars has paid its dues.
[00:19:05.199 --> 00:19:09.423]  We have proven that we are a cutting-edge news and information source.

[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:29.860]  Thank you.
[00:19:46.696 --> 00:19:48.939]  Targeting our endocrine system.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.463]  Targeting our hormones to suppress us.
[00:19:51.863 --> 00:19:55.208]  But Mother Nature is there to counter this onslaught.
[00:19:55.629 --> 00:20:03.660]  Everyone out there watching and listening to me owes it to themselves to give Mother Nature a try and to try super male or super female vitality.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.682]  We're making it easier than ever today with a special.
[00:20:06.842 --> 00:20:08.143]  We're running for two weeks only.

[00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:39.686]  I know these formulas work.
[00:20:39.946 --> 00:20:40.727]  They've worked for me.
[00:20:41.007 --> 00:20:45.510]  But regardless, you're supporting the InfoWar in a historic, critical time.
[00:20:46.071 --> 00:20:52.636]  I also want to take some time out to thank all of you that have supported InfoWarsTore.com and who have gotten these products.
[00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:59.193]  So for myself and the rest of the InfoWars crew, I salute you for being on the side of life in the fight against the globalists.
[00:21:01.545 --> 00:21:02.906]  Hi, I'm Dr. David Jones.
[00:21:03.027 --> 00:21:05.969]  I've been in practice for over 30 years in dentistry.
[00:21:06.249 --> 00:21:09.993]  In our health histories, we've always asked what people's primary complaint were.
[00:21:10.013 --> 00:21:12.535]  A third of the time, it's, I want whiter teeth.
[00:21:12.995 --> 00:21:26.828]  In the early days of dentistry, we used some fairly harsh chemicals in order to bleach the teeth and whiten them, and people were happy with the results, even though it created hypersensitivity and some problems that I consider fairly high risk.
[00:21:27.148 --> 00:21:30.450]  Recently, I was exposed to the Ghost Smile System.
[00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:36.853]  It allows a whitening gel to be applied to the teeth with a very good ultrasonic toothbrush system.
[00:21:37.013 --> 00:21:52.220]  The gel is activated by a light-emitting diode, or actually two light-emitting diodes, so it's a simple and elegant procedure that delivers office-quality whitening, and you don't have to spend the $600 it typically costs for an in-office treatment.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.341]  In my opinion, it's the most elegant and best value that I've ever seen.
[00:21:56.561 --> 00:22:00.402]  To get your GoSmile system, go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:22:00.942 --> 00:22:02.322]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:22:02.602 --> 00:22:03.882]  You can't survive without it.
[00:22:04.082 --> 00:22:05.003]  But where do you get it?
[00:22:05.283 --> 00:22:11.044]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:22:11.264 --> 00:22:16.985]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:22:17.185 --> 00:22:34.046]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:22:34.446 --> 00:22:36.569]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:22:36.929 --> 00:22:38.131]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:22:38.391 --> 00:22:39.172]  Easy assembly.
[00:22:39.432 --> 00:22:40.053]  Low maintenance.
[00:22:40.353 --> 00:22:42.196]  Replacement filters are simple to install.
[00:22:42.416 --> 00:22:45.019]  Go to InfowarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:23:06.064 --> 00:23:17.429]  Owen Schroyer from InfoWars.com and Hillary Clinton has returned to the campaign trail which provides me the golden opportunity to tear her speech apart limb from limb.
[00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:25.252]  Now I think she's getting a little nervous giving these speeches now because she's not really getting very detailed and she keeps echoing the same points.
[00:23:25.532 --> 00:23:28.733]  The one that she loved echoing today was how she cares about the kids.
[00:23:28.773 --> 00:23:32.655]  That's all she talked about, how she cares about the kids, how she cares about families.
[00:23:33.035 --> 00:23:35.756]  So let's begin to rule Hillary Clinton
[00:23:35.976 --> 00:23:36.456]  Yesterday.
[00:23:37.317 --> 00:23:43.340]  Because it is kids like Sarah that led me to politics in the first place.
[00:23:43.741 --> 00:23:46.963]  So there's the first echo of kids leading her to politics.
[00:23:47.203 --> 00:23:54.747]  Now it was a kid that was part of her first case of law where she got a child rapist off.
[00:23:54.887 --> 00:23:56.508]  So she really cares about the kids.
[00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:57.509]  Let's roll the next one.
[00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:05.494]  I tried to power through it, but even I had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good.
[00:24:06.072 --> 00:24:08.574]  See, this is how these campaigns work.
[00:24:08.634 --> 00:24:10.935]  This is how a candidate like Hillary Clinton works.
[00:24:11.336 --> 00:24:13.677]  You hear her saying the same thing over and over.
[00:24:13.857 --> 00:24:14.598]  Power through it.
[00:24:14.858 --> 00:24:15.579]  Power through it.
[00:24:15.819 --> 00:24:16.499]  Power through it.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.760]  On all the interviews.
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.141]  On all the talking points.
[00:24:19.281 --> 00:24:20.102]  On all the stories.
[00:24:20.182 --> 00:24:20.842]  Power through it.
[00:24:21.103 --> 00:24:28.908]  So they had a little session, they used a bunch of phrases, they decided power through it was the one to go with, and she just keeps saying it over and over.
[00:24:28.988 --> 00:24:31.630]  This is a controlled political candidate.
[00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:32.811]  Let's go to the next one.
[00:24:33.766 --> 00:24:37.908]  You know, I've been involved in politics in one way or another for many years.
[00:24:38.508 --> 00:24:42.470]  Now see, right there is the ultimate problem.
[00:24:42.811 --> 00:24:47.273]  You have people, most voters, realize that there's corruption in government.
[00:24:47.553 --> 00:24:48.834]  They're sick of the government.
[00:24:48.874 --> 00:24:50.695]  Government has a low approval rating.
[00:24:50.995 --> 00:24:53.056]  Here's Hillary Clinton admitting
[00:24:53.616 --> 00:24:57.219]  She was part of the government, admitting she is part of the problem.
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.221]  Why are people so insane?
[00:24:59.582 --> 00:25:08.850]  They recognize the problem, they admit there's issues in government, and they go right back to the trough with Hillary Clinton, who's been in government for decades.
[00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:10.211]  Let's go to the next one.
[00:25:11.272 --> 00:25:13.554]  You feel you're on your own.
[00:25:15.015 --> 00:25:19.740]  If you lose your job, or can't afford college, you're on your own.
[00:25:21.024 --> 00:25:27.271]  If your aging parent starts needing more help and you don't know what to do, you're on your own.
[00:25:28.592 --> 00:25:36.760]  Life events like these are catastrophic for some families, but mere bumps in the road for others.
[00:25:37.628 --> 00:25:41.189]  Now this is where she starts to go communist on us.
[00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:46.591]  This sounds like something right out of a communist written speech.
[00:25:46.872 --> 00:25:50.593]  First of all, this is the land of the free and the home of the brave, okay?
[00:25:50.813 --> 00:25:54.855]  We declared our independence hundreds of years ago.
[00:25:55.155 --> 00:25:55.835]  So yeah, that's right.
[00:25:56.235 --> 00:25:57.396]  I am on my own.
[00:25:57.756 --> 00:25:59.677]  That's what it means to be an American.
[00:25:59.897 --> 00:26:06.239]  That's the empowering thing it means to be on an American soil as a citizen.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:11.782]  But she's up here spouting communist rhetoric saying, oh, you shouldn't be independent.
[00:26:11.802 --> 00:26:13.283]  You need government to help you.
[00:26:13.543 --> 00:26:15.423]  There's people that are more privileged than you.
[00:26:15.804 --> 00:26:18.125]  These are communist talking points.
[00:26:18.465 --> 00:26:25.648]  Unbelievable that Clinton is now resorting to communist talking points and communist rhetoric on her campaign trail.
[00:26:25.868 --> 00:26:26.928]  Let's roll the next one!
[00:26:26.948 --> 00:26:29.649]  So there's the communist rhetoric continuing.
[00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:30.369]  But the irony here is...
[00:26:47.822 --> 00:26:49.624]  America is about independence.
[00:26:49.884 --> 00:26:52.987]  America is about empowering yourself, taking care of yourself.
[00:26:53.307 --> 00:26:56.530]  And she's up here saying, that's the opposite of what America is about.
[00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:58.732]  I think Hillary Clinton is confused.
[00:26:58.932 --> 00:27:01.014]  You know, today is the anniversary of the Constitution.
[00:27:01.054 --> 00:27:05.978]  Maybe Hillary Clinton just needs to read up a little bit on the Constitution, read up a little bit on the Declaration of Independence.
[00:27:06.158 --> 00:27:07.419]  But the truth of the matter is,
[00:27:08.447 --> 00:27:16.095]  The liberalization of this country is why Hillary Clinton can come out and speak like a communist.
[00:27:16.555 --> 00:27:23.442]  She can come out and demonize independence in her speeches because this is what they've done to American values.
[00:27:23.923 --> 00:27:24.944]  I cannot believe.
[00:27:25.524 --> 00:27:27.425]  It's one thing for Hillary to come out and lie.
[00:27:27.485 --> 00:27:28.225]  We're used to that.
[00:27:28.726 --> 00:27:33.028]  Now she is spouting communist rhetoric in her speeches.
[00:27:33.368 --> 00:27:37.430]  This would have been deplorable if she would have done this 30 years ago.
[00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.711]  Now she just gets away with it in broad daylight.
[00:27:39.931 --> 00:27:40.852]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:27:42.332 --> 00:27:51.497]  And above all, the knowledge that no matter what, your president is fighting for you and will always have your back.
[00:27:52.612 --> 00:27:53.072]  Really?
[00:27:53.793 --> 00:27:56.595]  Like the people that died in Benghazi?
[00:27:57.315 --> 00:28:00.057]  What about all the flood victims in Louisiana?
[00:28:00.197 --> 00:28:01.699]  You didn't make it there either.
[00:28:02.179 --> 00:28:03.100]  So, that's funny.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.122]  And you really had the peoples in Hades back too, didn't ya, Hillary?
[00:28:08.083 --> 00:28:09.204]  What a total fraud.
[00:28:09.584 --> 00:28:11.085]  She can't get away with this, folks.
[00:28:11.145 --> 00:28:13.006]  We're not gonna let her get away with this, alright?
[00:28:13.247 --> 00:28:17.870]  We're calling her out on the crap that she comes out and says.
[00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:18.450]  What a liar!
[00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:19.171]  Roll to the next one.
[00:28:20.385 --> 00:28:32.363]  I'm running for the LGBT teenager here in North Carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second class citizen.
[00:28:36.024 --> 00:28:38.226]  Folks, we have a right to free speech.
[00:28:38.867 --> 00:28:40.909]  We have a right to practice whatever religion we want.
[00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:43.352]  That's what this country is about, okay?
[00:28:44.193 --> 00:28:50.900]  If your free speech offends me, that's not a problem as long as you don't infringe on my rights, okay?
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:55.184]  So if you want to go hate me for whatever reason, you have every right to.
[00:28:55.565 --> 00:28:57.186]  That's the beauty of this country.
[00:28:57.867 --> 00:29:05.455]  This is one of the last bastions of freedom in the world, and Hillary wants to tear it apart in the name of political correctness.
[00:29:05.695 --> 00:29:12.102]  Hillary wants to tear it down in the name of safe spaces and protecting anyone from getting offended.
[00:29:12.422 --> 00:29:14.264]  No, we are not going to do that.
[00:29:14.444 --> 00:29:16.887]  This is the land of the free and the home of the brave, Hillary.
[00:29:17.287 --> 00:29:17.567]  Okay?
[00:29:17.767 --> 00:29:18.648]  So guess what, folks?
[00:29:19.429 --> 00:29:21.029]  You have the right to discriminate.
[00:29:21.349 --> 00:29:24.410]  And if that offends somebody else, then they can discriminate you.
[00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:25.490]  That's the beauty of it.
[00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:28.971]  But here in the 21st century, most people can get along.
[00:29:29.231 --> 00:29:36.092]  The only people who aren't able to get along and function in society are the liberals like Hillary Clinton, who get offended by everything.
[00:29:36.272 --> 00:29:37.252]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:29:38.472 --> 00:29:47.294]  He said that if another country's troops taunted ours, not fired at them, but taunted them,
[00:29:48.479 --> 00:29:53.361]  Actually, he never said he would start a war over that, so you just put words in his mouth.
[00:29:53.381 --> 00:29:54.741]  If anyone's trying to start wars, it's you!
[00:30:06.363 --> 00:30:06.803]  You know what?
[00:30:06.923 --> 00:30:14.766]  I think it's okay that Donald Trump doesn't want to get bullied and taunted by Islamofascist states like Iran.
[00:30:15.246 --> 00:30:21.108]  I think it's okay that Donald Trump doesn't want terrorist states like Iran taunting our soldiers.
[00:30:21.628 --> 00:30:21.868]  Okay?
[00:30:22.868 --> 00:30:24.249]  That is fine with me.
[00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:33.033]  If these countries think that we're so weak, if these countries can't take us seriously enough, that they're going to taunt our soldiers, then you know what?
[00:30:33.153 --> 00:30:41.036]  Maybe it's time we let our soldiers off the leash a little bit so that we can be respected a little bit more by some of these regions and some of these countries.
[00:30:41.416 --> 00:30:42.436]  Or hey, here's an idea.
[00:30:42.836 --> 00:30:45.837]  Why don't we just remove our troops from that region to begin with?
[00:30:46.077 --> 00:30:48.798]  And then we don't have to worry about them taunting us near their country.
[00:30:49.059 --> 00:30:49.999]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:30:51.167 --> 00:31:03.069]  So in these final days, let's try to tune out all the chatter and the non-stop analysis that doesn't often have much to do with what the next president has to do.
[00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:04.716]  Wouldn't you like that, Hillary?
[00:31:05.136 --> 00:31:08.039]  Wouldn't you love for us to stop the chatter?
[00:31:08.259 --> 00:31:10.341]  Wouldn't you love for the chatter to stop?
[00:31:10.541 --> 00:31:12.723]  Wouldn't you just love to control the narrative?
[00:31:13.064 --> 00:31:14.445]  That's what Hillary Clinton wants.
[00:31:14.625 --> 00:31:16.307]  She doesn't want you to think for your own.
[00:31:16.487 --> 00:31:20.110]  She doesn't want you to go out and talk about politics and policies and real issues.
[00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:21.051]  No, no, no, no.
[00:31:21.211 --> 00:31:22.092]  That's chatter.
[00:31:22.452 --> 00:31:27.894]  She wants you to focus on her and her campaign because she's gonna make America better.
[00:31:28.154 --> 00:31:29.194]  That's what Hillary's gonna do.
[00:31:29.434 --> 00:31:31.255]  She's been serving in government for decades.
[00:31:31.435 --> 00:31:35.236]  The government's been getting worse, but she's the answer to fix the problem.
[00:31:35.997 --> 00:31:36.817]  Let's roll the next one.
[00:31:37.997 --> 00:31:42.359]  We even put it in a new book called, you guessed it, Stronger Together.
[00:31:46.345 --> 00:31:50.227]  Get a copy of it, because it tells you everything Tim Kaine and I intend to do.
[00:31:50.667 --> 00:31:52.528]  Well, I doubt that that's true, but look at that.
[00:31:52.668 --> 00:31:58.291]  A shameless plug for her new book that has sold less than 3,000 copies in a week.
[00:31:58.632 --> 00:32:06.176]  An absolute pathetic failure, Hillary Clinton's new book, and she's out here doing a shameless plug on the campaign trail.
[00:32:06.616 --> 00:32:07.276]  Pathetic.
[00:32:07.576 --> 00:32:08.357]  Let's roll the next one.
[00:32:09.568 --> 00:32:13.093]  Now, like a lot of women, I have a tendency to over-prepare.
[00:32:13.654 --> 00:32:14.535]  Whoa, whoa!
[00:32:14.775 --> 00:32:16.157]  Where are the social justice warriors?
[00:32:16.178 --> 00:32:17.039]  That is sexist!
[00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:18.982]  Hillary Clinton is a sexist!
[00:32:19.262 --> 00:32:21.625]  All the social justice warriors are up in arms about that one.
[00:32:21.766 --> 00:32:22.567]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:32:23.482 --> 00:32:27.303]  We don't need a president who wants to take away people's health coverage.
[00:32:27.784 --> 00:32:33.126]  We need a president who wants everyone to have quality, affordable health care.
[00:32:33.226 --> 00:32:38.748]  No, Donald Trump wants everyone to have a job so that they can afford to pay for health care.
[00:32:38.988 --> 00:32:40.489]  That's how the economy works.
[00:32:40.709 --> 00:32:47.131]  You get a job, you contribute to civilization, and then you build a civilization, and you make a better future for your lineage.
[00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:51.613]  Hillary Clinton just wants to hand you everything, and that's not how we work in America.
[00:33:02.523 --> 00:33:07.988]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.528 --> 00:33:09.029]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.449 --> 00:33:12.492]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[00:33:13.173 --> 00:33:13.633]  30 servings.
[00:33:13.833 --> 00:33:16.436]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[00:33:16.756 --> 00:33:17.797]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.877 --> 00:33:18.818]  Infowarslife.com
[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all of the essential amino acids, all of the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.346]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!

[00:36:00.442 --> 00:36:01.983]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.690]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.031 --> 00:36:46.696]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:36:46.896 --> 00:36:53.022]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[00:36:53.322 --> 00:36:57.065]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[00:37:07.162 --> 00:37:19.012]  Well, the crime boss Hillary Rodham Clinton came out today and said that we should judge basically everybody, not just Donald Trump, off of what they originally actually said and basically did.
[00:37:19.672 --> 00:37:21.834]  That we should go off somebody's original record.
[00:37:22.235 --> 00:37:22.715]  Here's the clip.
[00:37:23.796 --> 00:37:29.421]  In recent weeks, he's tried to restrain himself and clean up his image.
[00:37:31.092 --> 00:37:38.277]  But as Maya Angelou once said, when someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time!
[00:37:39.939 --> 00:37:52.728]  So she's demonizing Donald Trump because he questioned Barack Obama's birth certificate and the fact that Barack Obama, when he was the editor of the Harvard Law Review, said in his bio that he was born in Kenya.
[00:37:53.269 --> 00:37:56.611]  But Trump said, okay, hey, you were born in America, let's just move on.
[00:37:57.492 --> 00:37:59.413]  But since Hillary brought up the past,
[00:38:00.214 --> 00:38:01.874]  Let's look at the past.
[00:38:01.914 --> 00:38:04.695]  Let's look at what she originally said, what she originally did.
[00:38:05.215 --> 00:38:19.898]  In her college thesis, she was a pen pal with Saul Alinsky, who wrote Rules for Radicals, who was an admitted communist and basically one of the ideological leaders of the Weathermen, who of course were also advisors to Obama.
[00:38:20.599 --> 00:38:22.199]  And he pledged his book to Lucifer.
[00:38:23.052 --> 00:38:29.695]  And he talked about deceiving the public, overthrowing America, going after Christians, creating basically a hell on earth.
[00:38:30.215 --> 00:38:38.038]  And there was sweet little Hillary being groomed all along and pen pals with him and writing her thesis on how wonderful Saul Alinsky was.
[00:38:38.618 --> 00:38:47.322]  After college, Hillary went on to represent child molesters in court and made jokes about how she couldn't believe guilty people could pass lie detector tests.
[00:38:49.997 --> 00:38:52.178]  He took a lie detector test.
[00:38:52.198 --> 00:38:53.279]  I had a polygraph test.
[00:38:53.319 --> 00:38:54.740]  Which he passed.
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:58.662]  Which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.
[00:39:12.247 --> 00:39:19.791]  Then she got thrown off of the Watergate investigative committee because she was caught fabricating evidence against Richard Nixon.
[00:39:20.212 --> 00:39:25.675]  I mean, this girl was involved in the dirtiest of the dirt from the moment she got out of the gate.
[00:39:26.095 --> 00:39:31.638]  Then she hitched her wagon to William Jefferson Clinton and her star began to rise.
[00:39:31.899 --> 00:39:35.721]  Oh, there were cattle future scams and swindling old folks
[00:39:36.261 --> 00:39:38.822]  out of their property in Arkansas with whitewater deals.
[00:39:39.082 --> 00:39:45.886]  There were CIA airfields at MENA and cocaine, admittedly, being flown in and the Clintons overseeing the whole operation.
[00:39:46.326 --> 00:39:51.488]  There were over a hundred murders, now known as Arkansaside, where enemies of the Clintons were killed.
[00:39:51.948 --> 00:39:59.072]  But don't worry, the Arkansas medical examiner, Fannie Malick, said it's totally normal to chop your arms, your legs, and your head off in a suicide.
[00:40:00.212 --> 00:40:03.093]  But once Hillary Clinton became co-president in 1993,
[00:40:05.171 --> 00:40:06.832]  The horror only intensified.
[00:40:06.932 --> 00:40:11.594]  She launched wars against the Serbs to bring in Jihad armies out of Albania.
[00:40:11.854 --> 00:40:17.737]  She bombed TV stations with depleted uranium and bragged that she's the one that got Clinton to go ahead and pull the trigger.
[00:40:18.497 --> 00:40:27.862]  She supported the most incredible sanctions, basically doubling what George Herbert Walker Bush had done, even stopping shipments of food into Iraq.
[00:40:28.582 --> 00:40:42.045]  And over a half million children died, but her own Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, her confidant, her mentor, told 60 Minutes that it was a good price to pay a half million dead kids.
[00:40:42.625 --> 00:40:45.066]  We have heard that a half a million children have died.
[00:40:45.926 --> 00:40:50.327]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[00:40:51.087 --> 00:40:54.268]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[00:40:55.359 --> 00:41:00.043]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.
[00:41:00.383 --> 00:41:07.689]  Now if I try to chronicle all the crimes committed by the Clintons when they were in the White House for 8 years, we'll be here for 10 hours, so let me just skip past
[00:41:08.837 --> 00:41:28.030]  All the stuff that happened, and Monica Lewinsky, and the Chinese generals in the White House, and our missile secrets being transferred to the Communist Chinese, and national sovereignty being sold out, and our jobs being sold out with NAFTA and GATT, and how the Clintons engineered getting rid of the Glass-Steagall Act to allow big megabanks to create all this counterfeit money and derivatives.
[00:41:28.371 --> 00:41:30.192]  Let's just forget about all that.
[00:41:30.592 --> 00:41:34.315]  Let's fast forward to what they've been doing in the last decade.
[00:41:34.995 --> 00:41:45.458]  Launching their big giant foundation, and we have the emails, where she sold access to the Chinese president, where she sold access through the State Department to change U.S.
[00:41:45.538 --> 00:41:47.939]  policy if donors would give her money.
[00:41:48.499 --> 00:41:56.262]  Phone calls to Huma Abedin and to other people in the State Department from donors to the Clinton Foundation asking for meetings, asking for access.
[00:41:56.362 --> 00:41:56.922]  True or false?
[00:41:57.562 --> 00:42:14.066]  First of all, there's no question there were phone calls made to get appointments for people, but Mohamed Yunus, Nobel Laureate, Melinda Gates, I mean these are people that any Secretary of State would have seen, courtesy appointments and others.
[00:42:14.506 --> 00:42:16.207]  There were also business people.
[00:42:16.227 --> 00:42:17.367]  There's no question about that.
[00:42:17.627 --> 00:42:21.308]  And then we learn, thanks to all the different hacked emails, which she admits are real,
[00:42:22.088 --> 00:42:29.159]  That she sent people dressed as Bernie Sanders supporters to attack Trump rallies so she could blame both Trump and Sanders.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:36.791]  Then she stole the nomination and even CNN and the Associated Press admitted that it was the super
[00:42:37.412 --> 00:42:37.792]  Pax.
[00:42:37.912 --> 00:42:39.353]  It was the big donors.
[00:42:39.433 --> 00:42:43.955]  It was the super delegates who actually decided who would be the nominee.
[00:42:44.555 --> 00:42:57.420]  And now that she's stolen the nomination, she's eyeing stealing the general election because she's way behind, even in these polls, even in places like DC, where she was 20 something points ahead of Trump.
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:59.420]  She's only a few points ahead of him now.
[00:42:59.801 --> 00:43:00.761]  She's in free fall.
[00:43:01.321 --> 00:43:07.966]  So the big question is, this woman that tells us, look at what somebody said first, look at what they did first, look at their record.
[00:43:08.766 --> 00:43:15.971]  But as Maya Angelou once said, when someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time!
[00:43:17.352 --> 00:43:20.274]  Before we start celebrating the fact that Hillary Clinton is in free fall,
[00:43:21.107 --> 00:43:26.630]  And that the mainstream media has been totally discredited trying to cover up her collapse in New York on 9-11.
[00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:32.612]  Before we celebrate that, you have to understand, the crime syndicate behind Hillary isn't going to give up power easily.
[00:43:32.953 --> 00:43:39.616]  They know nationalism is rising in Russia and with the Brexit and with what's happening now here in the United States with Donald Trump.
[00:43:39.896 --> 00:43:44.218]  So they're throwing everything they can against Trump and the nationalist movement.
[00:43:44.858 --> 00:43:47.600]  False flags, race riots, you name it.
[00:43:47.941 --> 00:43:49.642]  George Soros is turning up the heat.
[00:43:50.063 --> 00:43:54.967]  The Ford Foundation just gave $100 million to Black Lives Matter.
[00:43:55.587 --> 00:43:56.828]  This is the time for vigilance.
[00:43:57.149 --> 00:43:58.370]  This is the time to be focused.
[00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:01.833]  This is the time to be praying that this republic be restored.
[00:44:02.333 --> 00:44:23.169]  But with Hillary, we see this sickening bloodlust, this bloodthirst, where she brags about creating a failed state in Libya, and coming, and seeing, and Gaddafi dying, and then organizing Al-Qaeda to then become ISIS and invade Syria, and target Christians, and then not let them get out of the country, but bring the actual Sunni invaders into the United States.
[00:44:24.209 --> 00:44:27.791]  The truth is Hillary Clinton wants to mount America's head on the wall.
[00:44:28.151 --> 00:44:30.352]  Hillary Clinton wants to dominate this republic.
[00:44:30.812 --> 00:44:35.634]  Hillary Clinton is an enemy, a domestic enemy, and an agent of globalism.
[00:44:36.274 --> 00:44:39.976]  And if this republic is to survive, Hillary Clinton must fall.
[00:44:40.696 --> 00:44:50.860]  The good news is, Providence has always shown that when the people take action, do the right thing, and take those first steps, God will carry us historically the rest of the way.
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:52.501]  And the hand of doom
[00:44:53.772 --> 00:44:58.513]  As we see her deteriorate on a daily basis, has already reached Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[00:45:00.414 --> 00:45:02.015]  This is the heart of 1776!
[00:45:02.795 --> 00:45:22.601]  Alright Madam Secretary, can you hear me?
[00:45:22.621 --> 00:45:23.341]  Just nod if you can hear me.
[00:45:24.577 --> 00:45:25.037]  Okay, good.
[00:45:25.978 --> 00:45:28.259]  All right, Secretary Clinton, you are in Selma, Alabama.
[00:45:28.279 --> 00:45:31.180]  These people are not going to react to your New York accent.
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:36.483]  I need you to tone it down and use that really thick southern accent you've learned from living in Arkansas, all right?
[00:45:36.503 --> 00:45:36.763]  Come on.
[00:45:37.523 --> 00:45:39.704]  I don't feel no ways tired.
[00:45:40.885 --> 00:45:45.387]  I come too far from where I started from.
[00:45:46.425 --> 00:45:51.332]  All right, Secretary Clinton, you and I both know that those lives of the people that died in Benghazi don't even matter.
[00:45:51.632 --> 00:45:52.594]  They're hammering you right now.
[00:45:52.634 --> 00:45:54.496]  Just say, what difference does it make?
[00:45:54.737 --> 00:45:56.219]  At this point, what difference does it make?
[00:45:56.857 --> 00:45:59.379]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:05.685]  It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again.
[00:46:05.705 --> 00:46:08.347]  All right, you're kind of drawing this whole thing out a little too far.
[00:46:08.367 --> 00:46:09.668]  Let's go on ahead and change it up.
[00:46:10.709 --> 00:46:11.450]  Bark like a dog.
[00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:13.652]  Not like a ferocious dog, but like a chihuahua.
[00:46:13.932 --> 00:46:17.896]  Give me a... You know?
[00:46:19.937 --> 00:46:20.178]  Yeah.
[00:46:22.321 --> 00:46:26.065]  I think we should just raise taxes on the middle class, but you know I'm not the one running for president.
[00:46:26.105 --> 00:46:27.487]  We are going to raise taxes on the middle class!
[00:46:27.507 --> 00:46:39.661]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[00:46:40.606 --> 00:46:41.127]  Oh, sorry.
[00:46:41.447 --> 00:46:41.967]  Upward spiral.
[00:46:42.027 --> 00:46:42.508]  Upward spiral.
[00:46:42.728 --> 00:46:43.509]  Upward spiral.
[00:46:43.529 --> 00:46:45.310]  Now I want to mention two other things.
[00:46:45.831 --> 00:46:53.477]  Sir Clinton, last week it was reported on InfoWars.com that your email server was hacked and you knowingly continued to use your email server.
[00:46:53.737 --> 00:46:54.598]  Can you comment on that?
[00:46:54.618 --> 00:46:56.460]  It was a damn InfoWars reporter.
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.340]  They're asking about your emails.
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:57.761]  Deny!
[00:46:57.781 --> 00:46:58.101]  Deny!
[00:46:58.121 --> 00:46:58.421]  Deny!
[00:46:58.601 --> 00:46:59.082]  Deny!
[00:46:59.102 --> 00:47:00.203]  Yeah, it's totally untrue.
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.959]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.324 --> 00:48:56.946]  David Rockefeller wrote in his book, Memoirs, that the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government.
[00:48:56.986 --> 00:49:04.930]  The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries.
[00:49:22.139 --> 00:49:39.025]  It's 2016 and by all accounts, the natural rights of humanity are tiptoeing on a razor's edge, while a robot runs free in the streets of Moscow, pursued by the Russian police, ushering in a new age of artificial intelligence that is demanding answers.
[00:49:39.305 --> 00:49:49.288]  The Mirror reports, it is believed that the arrest occurred after a member of the public called a police as promo bots were recording the opinions of voters on a variety of topics.
[00:49:49.508 --> 00:49:58.717]  For further processing and analysis by the candidate's team, police asked to remove the robot away from the crowded area and even tried to handcuff him.
[00:49:58.897 --> 00:50:12.570]  Will robots like these be the physical arm of censorship when the submission of internet freedom is relegated to the multinational corporate overlords President Obama's legacy of globalism has signed us all over to?
[00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:25.558]  Zero Hedge reports, earlier this month, YouTube, the behemoth video sharing website, was accused of censoring users, claiming some of their videos had been barred from making money through the company's ad services.
[00:50:25.738 --> 00:50:39.186]  YouTube hosts like Philip DeFranco spoke out against the policy, claiming over a dozen of his videos had been flagged as inappropriate for advertising, including one dinged for graphic content or excessive strong language.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:43.724]  They'll use anything to overthrow the civilization, then bring in total control.
[00:50:43.744 --> 00:50:48.007]  Let me tell you, that's why they're bringing in, it's gotta be a million, they're keeping the numbers secret.
[00:50:48.528 --> 00:50:52.751]  Jihadis here, 5 million confirmed in Europe, first they claimed it was 100,000, remember that a few years ago?
[00:50:53.392 --> 00:51:00.738]  Because they're gonna let them run wild, go crazy, and then take everybody's rights, saying don't have any free speech, that's what made the Muslims mad.
[00:51:00.918 --> 00:51:04.401]  The Facebook censorship warriors have already begun.
[00:51:04.781 --> 00:51:05.722]  Notice, over here.
[00:51:07.478 --> 00:51:09.540]  Muslims are not terrorists.
[00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:15.985]  They have power because they're in control right now, but what we have on our side is that ideas have consequences.
[00:51:16.245 --> 00:51:17.746]  You can't stop ideas.
[00:51:19.528 --> 00:51:23.971]  Even the armies and the governments can't stop ideas if their time has come.
[00:51:24.191 --> 00:51:33.779]  And of course, the need has come, and certainly we hope to make it our time has come for the option to be, because I see the collapsing of this system
[00:51:34.119 --> 00:51:34.460]  I think so.
[00:51:51.482 --> 00:51:58.146]  For instance, the silliness of what this country has endorsed now with the Federal Reserve, that they know what interest rates should be.
[00:51:58.186 --> 00:52:03.529]  That's the most ridiculous thing in the world for somebody who knows anything about economics and free markets.
[00:52:04.029 --> 00:52:08.372]  So I think there's, in the midst of this mess, we do have opportunities.
[00:52:09.012 --> 00:52:17.016]  But the denial was strong on Capitol Hill, as the elite's delegates of derision played a shell game with the future of the 21st century.
[00:52:18.387 --> 00:52:24.390]  Do you agree with Reporters Without Borders that China is the world's leading enemy of the Internet?
[00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:28.893]  I think there are many countries around the world who, if I'm fortunate, prohibit access to information.
[00:52:29.013 --> 00:52:30.053]  I think it's bad every time.
[00:52:30.373 --> 00:52:33.015]  Do you think China is an enemy of the Internet?
[00:52:33.615 --> 00:52:38.077]  I don't have the competence to rank those.
[00:52:38.117 --> 00:52:38.778]  I didn't say rank.
[00:52:38.918 --> 00:52:43.080]  I said do you agree that China is an enemy of the Internet?
[00:52:45.023 --> 00:52:56.715]  I think there is a highly potential risk, if the transition doesn't go through, that China, together with Russia and other countries, will use that possibility to move the supervision of ICANN over to the UN.
[00:52:57.696 --> 00:52:59.337]  Is ICANN bound by the First Amendment?
[00:53:03.061 --> 00:53:04.583]  I think you know the answer to that question.
[00:53:04.603 --> 00:53:05.864]  I'm asking your views.
[00:53:06.745 --> 00:53:07.646]  To my understanding, no.
[00:53:08.407 --> 00:53:12.653]  What a year to be a robot, but more importantly, what a year to be a human!
[00:53:12.854 --> 00:53:14.736]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:53:23.618 --> 00:53:31.925]  A new advertisement making the rounds on German television is encouraging women to embrace tolerance by submitting to Islam.
[00:53:32.266 --> 00:53:33.647]  Margaret Howell joins me now.
[00:53:33.747 --> 00:53:37.750]  Now, I mean, this is a very small percentage of the population there in Germany.
[00:53:37.791 --> 00:53:49.521]  Granted, it is millions of people pouring into their border, but rather than encouraging them to assimilate to their new life in Western culture, it's all about people in Germany assimilating to their culture.
[00:53:49.861 --> 00:53:50.701]  Leanne, the heck with it.
[00:53:50.721 --> 00:53:51.842]  They've given up already.
[00:53:52.002 --> 00:54:05.428]  Now they've taken to ads that are sponsored by the UN National Educational and Scientific Club to say, they've got this slutty little blonde, she's prancing around in a hijab, she peeks through the hijab and she's like, embrace the burqa, man.
[00:54:05.488 --> 00:54:08.630]  Yeah, that's really classy broad right there.
[00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:10.290]  Enjoy your differences.
[00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:11.330]  Start the tolerance.
[00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:12.551]  She's very seductive.
[00:54:12.831 --> 00:54:15.171]  She's kind of cute, but she's prancing around.
[00:54:15.291 --> 00:54:19.072]  She doesn't really understand the significance of the hijab, what it means, what it represents.
[00:54:19.172 --> 00:54:24.773]  And look, it looks like, to me, they're waving their little white flag there because they have too many.
[00:54:24.793 --> 00:54:26.293]  They're flooded with migrants.
[00:54:26.333 --> 00:54:27.653]  They understand what it's doing to the country.
[00:54:27.673 --> 00:54:29.193]  They can't push back now.
[00:54:29.634 --> 00:54:37.595]  So it's all about starting the tolerance, which echoes the sentiment that a German lawmaker had, this Green Party leader, Stephanie von Berg.
[00:54:38.135 --> 00:54:44.099]  She's saying, look, we're going to celebrate the fact that the mass migration will bring an end to the German majority population.
[00:54:44.739 --> 00:54:46.100]  Celebration time!
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:46.620]  WTF!
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:47.981]  Excuse me if I can say that.
[00:54:48.361 --> 00:54:48.581]  Right.
[00:54:48.621 --> 00:54:53.284]  Well, that's I mean, that's what people are talking about, is that the birth rate has gone down in these Western countries.
[00:54:53.644 --> 00:54:57.006]  And so they need to import new people to be able to control.
[00:54:57.026 --> 00:55:00.028]  It's absolutely insane.
[00:55:00.368 --> 00:55:04.991]  Of course, I don't think that would really fly here because people would, you know, say it's cultural appropriation.
[00:55:05.011 --> 00:55:06.031]  We've got women here.
[00:55:06.051 --> 00:55:07.132]  It's racist to wear the hijab.
[00:55:07.592 --> 00:55:16.039]  We've seen women here, American professors, who wear the hijab, the headscarf, in solidarity because they want to be seen as a unifier amongst women.
[00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:18.842]  They're feminist and they're progressive.
[00:55:19.042 --> 00:55:20.943]  They're freaking idiots is what they are.
[00:55:20.983 --> 00:55:24.386]  They don't recognize the hate symbol that comes along with a lot of the
[00:55:25.427 --> 00:55:32.811]  A lot of the issues for wearing something that makes women basically non-human, non-citizens, non-vocal.
[00:55:33.111 --> 00:55:34.972]  We've cut off your voice, basically everything but your eyes.
[00:55:35.192 --> 00:55:38.754]  So you have no rights, no voice, no presence in society.
[00:55:38.774 --> 00:55:41.135]  But hey, we're going to embrace that because we're really well-intentioned.
[00:55:41.415 --> 00:55:42.356]  We're also progressive.
[00:55:42.496 --> 00:55:46.358]  And I know a lot of Muslim women wear it, and then a lot of other Muslim women say it's very oppressive.
[00:55:46.538 --> 00:55:49.740]  And they don't understand why all of a sudden it's being pushed on them.
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:51.000]  I'm all for liberty, Liam.
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:53.481]  If somebody wants to put something on their head, you go right ahead.
[00:55:53.521 --> 00:55:59.344]  But I'm talking about like this, you know, this, this, um, in the billions, you know, this forced ideology.
[00:55:59.504 --> 00:56:03.785]  And it's such a subjugation of women if it's forced and not embraced.
[00:56:03.846 --> 00:56:06.026]  It's one thing if you or I show up in a headscarf.
[00:56:06.046 --> 00:56:06.727]  We've chosen it.
[00:56:06.847 --> 00:56:10.828]  It's another thing entirely if, uh, you know, we're, we're seeing this symbol.
[00:56:10.848 --> 00:56:15.430]  You have to, or you will be beaten or stoned in the street, or you're asking to be raped.
[00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:16.831]  You're asking for it.
[00:56:17.551 --> 00:56:20.092]  Speaking of rape, that's so funny you would say that.
[00:56:21.293 --> 00:56:23.354]  This is also a part of this German ad campaign.
[00:56:23.374 --> 00:56:25.975]  The article goes on, it's really unbelievable.
[00:56:26.035 --> 00:56:32.058]  Holding potential rapists at arm's length, not wearing provocative clothing, and wearing sneakers so you can outrun them!
[00:56:33.318 --> 00:56:35.139]  Yeah, I mean a laugh, that's not funny.
[00:56:35.159 --> 00:56:36.459]  No rape bracelets though.
[00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:37.920]  I'm laughing out of nervousness.
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:42.982]  They've moved on from the suggestion of the rape bracelets and no rape tattoos, no touching.
[00:56:43.422 --> 00:56:46.323]  Now let's go ahead and talk about the mayor there in London, of course.
[00:56:46.343 --> 00:56:49.184]  I know you've kind of harped on him before for what he's done.
[00:56:49.224 --> 00:56:56.387]  His first thing that he actually did as mayor there in London was banned sexy advertisements on the subway, because of course that's a
[00:56:57.047 --> 00:57:03.770]  He's also gone to appoint a deputy mayor, a cultural police if you will, who was a member of CAGE.
[00:57:04.110 --> 00:57:07.531]  If you recall, CAGE said that Jihadi John was a beautiful man.
[00:57:07.551 --> 00:57:10.192]  This is who he's appointed as his culture police.
[00:57:10.732 --> 00:57:12.653]  Sadiq Khan had the nerve and I love you.
[00:57:12.713 --> 00:57:22.757]  Thank you Sadiq Khan for coming to Chicago because you really, your arrogance, your blasting of our presidential candidate, hopefully it will motivate people, it will inspire them to push back against you.
[00:57:23.477 --> 00:57:26.920]  Which is what we saw Obama did when he was lecturing the British people regarding Brexit.
[00:57:27.261 --> 00:57:28.822]  Sadiq Khan did this in reverse, Leigh-Anne.
[00:57:28.862 --> 00:57:29.823]  He comes to Chicago.
[00:57:30.223 --> 00:57:32.645]  Of course he's sponsored by a global forum.
[00:57:33.086 --> 00:57:34.127]  Not shocking there.
[00:57:34.207 --> 00:57:38.971]  He says, Donald Trump is playing into the hands of ISIL, not surprisingly.
[00:57:39.291 --> 00:57:45.857]  Donald Trump is speaking out against radical Islam, which makes it easy for terrorists to radicalize as young people because he's making them feel alienated.
[00:57:46.137 --> 00:57:50.161]  So it's not in fact their ideology that's incompatible with Western values.
[00:57:50.541 --> 00:57:53.143]  It's Donald Trump forcing them to join ISIS.
[00:58:20.401 --> 00:58:20.681]  Right.
[00:58:21.342 --> 00:58:24.324]  Well, we saw what ISIS did to the city of Petra and those ruins.
[00:58:24.404 --> 00:58:27.266]  We see what ISIS does to precious artifacts when they enter.
[00:58:27.286 --> 00:58:33.970]  We see what ISIS does to people, accusing, we covered this yesterday, 12 people they'd rounded up two days ago, actually.
[00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:36.352]  They were going to light them on fire, accusing them of being U.S.
[00:58:36.372 --> 00:58:36.752]  spies.
[00:58:37.113 --> 00:58:42.857]  Meanwhile, our president has rubber-stamped through 110,000 new refugees, beginning October 1st, because, you know, less than .046%
[00:58:49.542 --> 00:58:51.625]  But we have to integrate, Leigh-Anne.
[00:58:51.665 --> 00:58:52.868]  That's all part of the plan.
[00:58:53.309 --> 00:58:54.651]  Integration and assimilation.
[00:58:55.072 --> 00:58:56.595]  Thank you guys for tuning in tonight.
[00:58:56.695 --> 00:58:58.238]  We will see you here again Monday, 7 p.m.
[00:58:58.418 --> 00:58:58.618]  Central.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.934]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.394 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.387]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.787 --> 00:59:36.008]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.308 --> 00:59:38.608]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
