[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:05.151]  World government taking on how America was sold out to special interest Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and others.
[00:00:05.471 --> 00:00:07.852]  They have literally sold us out to Communist China.
[00:00:08.453 --> 00:00:17.436]  It was announced they are taking over all of Hollywood, all major TV, net style censorship run by Zuckerberg and the Chinese over us.
[00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:19.617]  This is 21st century warfare.
[00:00:19.677 --> 00:00:20.638]  We are wide open.
[00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:24.322]  The Saudi Arabians, it's all in the WikiLeaks.
[00:00:24.342 --> 00:00:28.584]  Saudi Arabians, the communist Chinese, they're good at enslaving a billion, 300 million folks.
[00:00:29.365 --> 00:00:32.466]  And the big robber barons have gone to them with their management system for us.
[00:00:33.347 --> 00:00:34.267]  Now, Jesse James.
[00:00:34.387 --> 00:00:39.029]  Everybody knows him from one of the top reality TV stars ever with gun shows and car shows and motorcycle shows.
[00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.670]  I've known James like six years.
[00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:44.032]  And we've been friends for a while.
[00:00:45.413 --> 00:00:46.493]  He's working with Trump.
[00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:47.834]  He's friends with Trump.
[00:00:49.172 --> 00:00:53.534]  One of the first people that told me like five years ago that Trump was a patriot, I should be looking for Trump to make a move.
[00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:57.076]  He called me up a few days ago and he said, I'm ready to come on.
[00:00:57.976 --> 00:01:00.217]  And I mean, this is a guy who's offered all sorts of TV shows, you name it.
[00:01:00.237 --> 00:01:02.278]  He hadn't been on TV in a long time, didn't do a lot of stuff.
[00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.101]  He's driving in right now to be here with us to talk about what's going on and what's happening.
[00:01:09.638 --> 00:01:11.158]  And what we're facing as a society and a culture.
[00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:16.000]  And I'm telling Leanne McAdoo and Joe Biggs and others that haven't got a chance today yet with all that's happening.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.261]  If they want to come in in the next hour after talking to Stone for 15 minutes and cover what they think is important, they are welcome as well.
[00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:23.141]  So that chair is open.
[00:01:23.462 --> 00:01:25.002]  We have a lot of folks in here with us today.
[00:01:25.802 --> 00:01:30.163]  This is a 52-hour broadcast and this isn't a spectator sport.
[00:01:30.283 --> 00:01:30.743]  You know that.
[00:01:30.783 --> 00:01:31.303]  You're awesome.
[00:01:32.144 --> 00:01:32.964]  We've gone from
[00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:38.695]  Millions a day in viewers on videos online to tens of millions.
[00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:39.977]  I mean it is now crazy.
[00:01:40.598 --> 00:01:47.085]  We have put out six different live videos today that as we speak have three and a half million views on Facebook and YouTube alone.
[00:01:47.526 --> 00:01:49.228]  By the end of the night it'll be like six, seven million.
[00:01:49.997 --> 00:01:59.999]  We're on our way, if you spread the links to InfoWars.com forward slash show, to our feed, the YouTube feeds, the Facebook feeds, to having 100 million views by the time this is done Wednesday night.
[00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.740]  And I want to just throw that in the establishment's face.
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.462]  We have gone from 300 and something on the web to 170 on the web, bigger than the BBC, bigger than the Washington Post, bigger than the Wall Street Journal.
[00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:12.443]  That's just our website.
[00:02:12.463 --> 00:02:13.263]  That's one small part.
[00:02:13.283 --> 00:02:14.484]  That's like 25% of what we do.
[00:02:14.764 --> 00:02:16.185]  We have Google Analytics on all of it.
[00:02:16.465 --> 00:02:17.386]  It's NSA software.
[00:02:17.646 --> 00:02:18.206]  We're using it.
[00:02:18.507 --> 00:02:19.327]  We're honest about it.
[00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:23.930]  Just like an iPhone's very evil, made by slaves, but it can be a tool to fight the globalists.
[00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.992]  The point is, InfoWars is on all 10 cylinders.
[00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:28.152]  Dominating.
[00:02:28.492 --> 00:02:29.573]  Hammering them to hell.
[00:02:30.173 --> 00:02:30.954]  It is over the top.
[00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:33.475]  And that's all because of you and your prayers and your support.
[00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:35.637]  Now, Roger Stone,
[00:02:36.926 --> 00:02:37.967]  Was going to already be here today.
[00:02:38.407 --> 00:02:39.248]  His idea, we're very honored.
[00:02:39.268 --> 00:02:40.309]  He's going to fly in tomorrow morning.
[00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.411]  He'll be here Tuesday and Wednesday with us.
[00:02:43.372 --> 00:02:45.153]  They claimed it was voter intimidation.
[00:02:45.794 --> 00:02:51.979]  They claim that he and Trump with exit polls that were being done very scientific by the book, Robinson or massive scrutiny, why not?
[00:02:54.622 --> 00:02:57.384]  Federal appeals court said, yes, they're right.
[00:02:57.524 --> 00:02:58.325]  They're not violating the law.
[00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.307]  They're not intimidating, as the media's claimed.
[00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:02.609]  Now the Supreme Court has confirmed that today.
[00:03:03.854 --> 00:03:05.755]  So Stone was unable, going into D.C.
[00:03:05.795 --> 00:03:10.017]  to be part of this hearing, to be here now, but he'll be here in the morning, flying out at 6 a.m.
[00:03:10.437 --> 00:03:16.960]  This is a big deal, but we're going to move on from that after he briefly talks about it, because the big news is, the mainline polls, from the L.A.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:27.705]  Times, even ABC News, to Reuters, to CNN, that have been adding 7, that's the lowest, 9, 10, 15, 20, 30 points against Trump, oversampling Democrats.
[00:03:27.725 --> 00:03:28.445]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:03:28.465 --> 00:03:30.906]  We're going to oversample, make it look like she's unstoppable.
[00:03:30.946 --> 00:03:32.747]  That's John Podesta, our Chief of Staff.
[00:03:33.476 --> 00:03:38.578]  When he's not at Alistair Crowley rituals, literally, or selling out to the Russians, that's what he's doing.
[00:03:40.418 --> 00:03:45.440]  Well, I made some calls, and again, I know Democrats, Republicans, you name it, and I do wear a journalist hat.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.221]  I'm a pundit, I'm a rabble-rouser, I'm a patriot, but I wear a journalist hat.
[00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:53.343]  People know, if something's off-record, unless it's murder or something, or criminal, it's off-record.
[00:03:53.843 --> 00:03:56.384]  That's my stock in trade, is people can trust me.
[00:03:56.784 --> 00:04:04.327]  I made a lot of calls tonight, and I said, are these polls right, that suddenly, even in Cook polls, he's 5, 10 points ahead, and they said, oh my God.
[00:04:05.123 --> 00:04:09.927]  That's why she's desperately cancelled going to all these red states and battleground states, purple states.
[00:04:10.267 --> 00:04:14.050]  She's in blue states now, like Pennsylvania and others, because she's in free fall.
[00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.391]  The momentum at the end, just like Reagan in 1980, has happened.
[00:04:18.906 --> 00:04:23.567]  And it is such a tsunami, such a tsunami, that they're going to have trouble.
[00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:27.908]  Even though there's election fraud, even though they've got dead people voting, they've been caught, illegals, all of it.
[00:04:28.648 --> 00:04:29.808]  This is such repudiation.
[00:04:29.848 --> 00:04:35.709]  Well, what do you expect running a half-dead creature that's, you know, Clintons, Bushes, Bushes, Clintons, we're sick of it.
[00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.050]  We'd vote for a frickin' ashtray over this lady.
[00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.791]  But it isn't an ashtray, it's a patriot who understands we cut taxes like Kennedy, productivity goes up.
[00:04:46.508 --> 00:04:48.169]  Money goes up what comes into the Treasury.
[00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:52.250]  You cut taxes, at least for three to four years, money goes up what comes in because people spend more.
[00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.870]  They get involved.
[00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.831]  They're optimistic.
[00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:54.731]  I'd hire more folks.
[00:04:55.171 --> 00:04:56.332]  Good God, I thought Bush was bad.
[00:04:56.452 --> 00:04:57.092]  Obama got in.
[00:04:57.112 --> 00:04:57.892]  Taxes went way up.
[00:04:58.032 --> 00:04:58.753]  I had to cut back.
[00:04:59.293 --> 00:05:00.653]  So Roger Stone joins us.
[00:05:00.693 --> 00:05:01.433]  He's exhausted.
[00:05:02.014 --> 00:05:03.994]  He's been working 20 hours a day.
[00:05:04.014 --> 00:05:05.815]  This guy, we talk at 2 a.m.
[00:05:06.415 --> 00:05:07.156]  I get up at 6 a.m.
[00:05:08.396 --> 00:05:09.237]  He's sending me texts.
[00:05:09.357 --> 00:05:09.817]  I call him.
[00:05:09.837 --> 00:05:13.500]  He's like sleepwalking on the phone the other day on Sunday morning at 6 a.m.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.741]  and I'm like, are you up?
[00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:15.982]  Well, not really, but kind of.
[00:05:16.002 --> 00:05:18.464]  We've got to do this, we've got to do that.
[00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:21.006]  So, I mean, he's exhausted right now.
[00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:24.328]  Roger Stone, I've talked to my sources.
[00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:30.293]  They say it looks like a tsunami, but because of the fraud, they want to be cautiously optimistic.
[00:05:30.313 --> 00:05:32.935]  Hillary canceled her fireworks that were set for tomorrow.
[00:05:33.335 --> 00:05:35.217]  She's panicking with some midnight thing with
[00:05:35.717 --> 00:05:36.918]  First of all, Alex, let me say that
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:05.843]  In all honesty, and you didn't pay me to say this, you didn't prompt me to say this, and I didn't warn you that I was going to say this, but if it were not for Brain Force right now, I would be completely non-functional.
[00:06:05.963 --> 00:06:12.144]  It really gives you mental clarity and a little boost of energy when you just got to give a little more.
[00:06:12.965 --> 00:06:14.285]  So, it's a great product.
[00:06:15.106 --> 00:06:21.191]  And I did have, as Dick Nixon would say, a silver bullet very dry a little earlier.
[00:06:21.271 --> 00:06:25.254]  So I'm really feeling very good about the momentum of this election.
[00:06:25.294 --> 00:06:34.762]  You see, in politics, the worst place to be is holding a narrow lead, trying to avoid error, sticking to the same old stuff.
[00:06:35.743 --> 00:06:36.263]  I think so.
[00:06:53.525 --> 00:06:53.805]  We're good.
[00:07:15.818 --> 00:07:19.481]  Uh, Gary Johnson 2.5, uh, Jill Stein 1.
[00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:26.065]  Florida, uh, Hillary Clinton at 46, Trump at 50, very strong, hitting the magic number.
[00:07:26.785 --> 00:07:29.947]  Gary Johnson at 2.5, Jill Stein at .5.
[00:07:30.668 --> 00:07:34.630]  Michigan, here's a surprise, uh, Hillary Clinton and the Union Machine at 47.
[00:07:36.138 --> 00:07:43.541]  Donald Trump at 48.5 statistically within the... And that's why she's holding emergency rallies in Michigan tonight.
[00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:49.903]  And in Georgia, it is Hillary 45, Donald Trump 52.
[00:07:49.983 --> 00:07:53.944]  That's what in business, in politics is known as an ass kick.
[00:07:54.844 --> 00:07:55.184]  Wow.
[00:07:55.525 --> 00:08:05.448]  Then there is an interesting second measure here, Alex, where the question is, who are your neighbors voting for?
[00:08:07.796 --> 00:08:08.897]  Very interesting measure.
[00:08:09.057 --> 00:08:10.938]  How do they feel this is going?
[00:08:11.158 --> 00:08:15.360]  I know so many liberals who are good people, because I mean, compared to conservatives, they're apples and oranges.
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.440]  Some are great, some are bad.
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.941]  But good people, they're misguided, but they're liberals.
[00:08:19.562 --> 00:08:23.323]  And all these women that are my mother's friends that I've known my whole life, they're all for Trump.
[00:08:23.704 --> 00:08:26.265]  They literally jump up and down and hate Hillary.
[00:08:26.765 --> 00:08:33.048]  And then everybody, I mean, I've seen one sticker for Hillary in a week in Austin, a supposed blue city in Texas.
[00:08:33.068 --> 00:08:33.668]  So what's that like?
[00:08:33.708 --> 00:08:34.889]  So listen to these numbers.
[00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:36.750]  Who are your neighbors voting for?
[00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.051]  Pennsylvania, Hillary 40, Trump 53.
[00:08:39.491 --> 00:08:39.872]  Wow.
[00:08:42.153 --> 00:08:45.695]  Florida, and just to be fair, Gary Johnson 3.5, Jill Stein 0.5.
[00:08:45.755 --> 00:08:48.957]  Florida, Hillary Clinton 37, Donald Trump 55.
[00:08:49.077 --> 00:08:50.257]  Johnson 4 points, Stein 0.5.
[00:08:50.297 --> 00:08:51.898]  Michigan, Trump 40, pardon me, Clinton 40, Trump 52.
[00:09:05.089 --> 00:09:08.591]  Johnson 3.5, and Jill Stein 1.
[00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:18.176]  And then lastly, Georgia 40 for Clinton, 55 for Trump, and 3.5 for Johnson, 0 for Stein.
[00:09:18.236 --> 00:09:25.921]  So, now, there is a phenomenon in which the Trump supporters have more intensity, they hang more yard signs.
[00:09:27.453 --> 00:09:38.975]  You know, they light up more billboards, they have more things on their cars, and they wear more of the paraphernalia because they're, you know, they're enthusiastic, God-loving, country-loving patriots.
[00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:39.535]  They're alive.
[00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:42.276]  And they're ready to fight for their country.
[00:09:42.296 --> 00:09:42.856]  They're fed up.
[00:09:43.056 --> 00:09:45.196]  They don't like what they see happening to America.
[00:09:46.697 --> 00:09:49.097]  And they're ready for a leader.
[00:09:49.137 --> 00:09:53.998]  They're ready for somebody who will snatch this country from the globalist grasp.
[00:09:55.871 --> 00:09:56.711]  They're ready for war.
[00:09:56.951 --> 00:10:08.054]  So, I mean, these numbers are very positive, and in terms of directionally now, I have not seen data on Nevada and New Hampshire.
[00:10:08.154 --> 00:10:14.276]  It is very hard for me to get to the magic 270 in my own calculation.
[00:10:14.316 --> 00:10:16.016]  This is one of the great things about Nixon.
[00:10:16.056 --> 00:10:21.698]  He had memorized the electoral vote for every state, and he knew them in every combination.
[00:10:21.738 --> 00:10:22.798]  He had them memorized.
[00:10:23.866 --> 00:10:27.950]  He could basically say, well, there's two or three different paths to victory.
[00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:33.034]  He would say, this is like drawing to an inside straight, but you would need Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida.
[00:10:33.094 --> 00:10:34.275]  It was just encyclopedic.
[00:10:34.916 --> 00:10:37.738]  I've been trying to figure out that formula for Trump.
[00:10:39.179 --> 00:10:43.463]  Winning Michigan would obviate the need to carry Nevada and New Hampshire.
[00:10:44.847 --> 00:10:49.109]  Nevada clearly reads in there the fixes and it looks like this is a layman, am I right?
[00:10:49.569 --> 00:10:51.430]  Well, I think there's a lot of problems.
[00:10:51.731 --> 00:10:58.034]  I don't think that the Trump campaign has been as well-led as it could be.
[00:10:58.054 --> 00:11:05.497]  A lot of grassroots complaints from rank-and-file activists about the leadership there.
[00:11:05.938 --> 00:11:10.600]  This is really kind of the old AFP, Corey Lewandowski crowd.
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.521]  There's not much talent here.
[00:11:13.101 --> 00:11:21.852]  And I don't know what kind of resources the party has put in, but I'm told that they are reasonable.
[00:11:22.513 --> 00:11:28.161]  So it is ironic that this fellow, Hecht, is running for the Senate and is now behind.
[00:11:28.983 --> 00:11:30.305]  That's right, now we've got...
[00:11:43.985 --> 00:11:48.649]  The traitor Ryan caught in emails with Hillary about Supreme Court jobs for his family.
[00:11:49.029 --> 00:11:49.870]  So here's the bottom line.
[00:11:50.511 --> 00:11:51.351]  We see it in the polls.
[00:11:51.391 --> 00:11:52.112]  We see the numbers.
[00:11:52.192 --> 00:11:53.013]  Record turnout.
[00:11:53.673 --> 00:11:55.995]  Huge advantages in early voting.
[00:11:56.015 --> 00:11:57.036]  Hillary claims she would have that.
[00:11:57.096 --> 00:11:58.398]  She doesn't in Florida and other areas.
[00:11:59.118 --> 00:12:02.001]  Clearly, as a layman correct me if I'm wrong, Trump is ahead.
[00:12:02.061 --> 00:12:07.125]  He's set to win tomorrow with a pretty good margin here and a lot of battlegrounds in the general states.
[00:12:07.385 --> 00:12:10.868]  Hillary's panicking, running around in four or five different states she thought were blue.
[00:12:11.969 --> 00:12:12.690]  Is that correct?
[00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:13.791]  And then what do we expect?
[00:12:13.812 --> 00:12:14.753]  Because they're so arrogant.
[00:12:14.773 --> 00:12:22.502]  We have the WikiLeaks rigging the questions, rigging the debates, rigging the questions for Trump in Wolf Blitzer interviews, rigging the polls, rigging everything under the sun.
[00:12:22.983 --> 00:12:30.332]  So I know we don't want to have the cart before the horse, but clearly it looks to me like Trump has the momentum and is going to have a big victory.
[00:12:31.455 --> 00:12:32.677]  I think he has momentum.
[00:12:32.717 --> 00:12:37.403]  I think he's a candidate on the move, whether he can pass her on time.
[00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:43.370]  I think she started here with a small lead that he had to erase, but she is steadily losing.
[00:12:45.467 --> 00:12:49.351]  Altitude, on the other hand, she has a number of structural advantages.
[00:12:50.352 --> 00:13:05.526]  Again, you know, in Nevada you have a very, very well-oiled union machine with some of the community groups in the minority communities are funded with federal dollars.
[00:13:05.606 --> 00:13:07.108]  It's a neat little political machine.
[00:13:07.648 --> 00:13:09.530]  And it's cranking away for Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.012]  And these are people basically owned by the government like the Chicago machine.
[00:13:12.032 --> 00:13:12.753]  So here's the bottom line.
[00:13:13.273 --> 00:13:17.016]  If Trump wins... The Republican Party in Nevada, in all honesty, is a non-existent shell.
[00:13:17.216 --> 00:13:17.697]  It just is.
[00:13:17.917 --> 00:13:18.117]  Sure.
[00:13:18.497 --> 00:13:24.202]  If Trump wins, though, as Michael Moore admits, the biggest FU in the establishment ever, a seismic shock.
[00:13:24.622 --> 00:13:28.165]  But regardless, it looks like he's pulling ahead to me and a lot of other folks.
[00:13:28.405 --> 00:13:29.306]  You're saying that in the polls.
[00:13:29.746 --> 00:13:33.490]  Regardless, it's a huge victory that globalism is on its heels.
[00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.972]  Nationalism is rising.
[00:13:36.732 --> 00:13:42.337]  This whole movement has taken us light years into the future in our fight against the NWO.
[00:13:43.018 --> 00:13:52.346]  Well, there is even a piece I think in, I believe it was in Politico tonight, that agreed that her electoral act doesn't look quite so likely now.
[00:13:52.467 --> 00:13:56.110]  It's finally dawning on some that Trump is on the move.
[00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:00.434]  But I must tell you, among the Democratic Party elite,
[00:14:01.454 --> 00:14:10.002]  Who I have to bump into here when I'm in Manhattan at some of the more fashionable watering holes and so on.
[00:14:10.622 --> 00:14:13.465]  There's an arrogance of Hillary will be over 300.
[00:14:14.085 --> 00:14:16.728]  This is going to be one of the great drubbings since Goldwater.
[00:14:17.108 --> 00:14:19.090]  And there's no question that
[00:14:22.634 --> 00:14:26.297]  That there are things that Trump could have done differently in his campaign.
[00:14:26.377 --> 00:14:35.304]  But we are where we are, and despite whatever shortcomings he may have had as a candidate, he has battled himself to the position one wants to be in at the close.
[00:14:35.344 --> 00:14:37.626]  Now, he just walked into politics and took it all over.
[00:14:37.646 --> 00:14:39.727]  Roger Stone, let me bring this up to you.
[00:14:40.928 --> 00:14:42.069]  You're an honorable person.
[00:14:42.369 --> 00:14:45.490]  I've known you, I won't make it like five years ago, but I've known you really good a year and a half.
[00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.651]  They call you dirty trickster and full of this info.
[00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:51.433]  I found like your real trick is that you tell the truth and really tell people what you really think is happening.
[00:14:52.073 --> 00:14:53.454]  It's been frightening how accurate you've been.
[00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:55.752]  But let's get down to brass tacks.
[00:14:55.872 --> 00:14:57.954]  Gary Johnson, I knew 10 years ago and interviewed him.
[00:14:57.974 --> 00:14:59.595]  I've interviewed him probably 10, 15 times.
[00:14:59.935 --> 00:15:00.716]  He's been in studio.
[00:15:00.736 --> 00:15:02.277]  He acted very weird last time he was here.
[00:15:02.297 --> 00:15:03.818]  He acts weird on TV.
[00:15:04.299 --> 00:15:05.560]  This Governor Weld creature.
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.762]  I've got a clip I want to play endorsing Hillary.
[00:15:08.803 --> 00:15:12.185]  Donald Trump, and all of us, took over the Republican Party.
[00:15:13.006 --> 00:15:15.408]  The liberals, the Democrats, took over the Libertarians.
[00:15:15.588 --> 00:15:20.812]  And at this point with Gary Johnson halfway stomping for Hillary, Weld openly doing it.
[00:15:20.832 --> 00:15:21.913]  I want to play this clip.
[00:15:22.514 --> 00:15:23.855]  I think you said the name of the Republic.
[00:15:24.847 --> 00:15:28.049]  You've been very classy, but I'm not a guy that wants to stab friends in the back.
[00:15:28.089 --> 00:15:30.010]  I know you were the head of his campaign for a while.
[00:15:30.431 --> 00:15:33.532]  Last time, Gary Johnson, who I liked before, because there wasn't any choice.
[00:15:33.572 --> 00:15:34.593]  Sure, I'd support a libertarian.
[00:15:35.454 --> 00:15:40.677]  Gary Johnson may be the man that actually hands Hillary the destruction of Western civilization, nuclear war, and may destroy the planet.
[00:15:41.117 --> 00:15:43.118]  So I want to play this clip and ask you about Gary Johnson.
[00:15:43.419 --> 00:15:44.940]  And any libertarians out there,
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.921]  Because you've got Stein at .5.
[00:15:47.261 --> 00:15:48.261]  She's saying endorse Trump.
[00:15:48.582 --> 00:15:49.422]  He doesn't want nuclear war.
[00:15:49.442 --> 00:15:51.763]  We've got this guy at 3%, 3.5% in Florida.
[00:15:52.044 --> 00:15:53.625]  That could give the victory.
[00:15:53.665 --> 00:15:58.007]  So, is it Gary Johnson, who we put on our tombstone, killed the planet Earth?
[00:15:58.507 --> 00:16:00.488]  Gave the whore, Hillary, total control?
[00:16:00.709 --> 00:16:04.371]  Let's play the clip of his surrogate, Weld, endorsing Hillary.
[00:16:04.391 --> 00:16:04.671]  Here it is.
[00:16:05.962 --> 00:16:11.363]  I can't imagine that you wouldn't tell a person in North Carolina or Ohio.
[00:16:11.543 --> 00:16:13.504]  I can't imagine that you're a more ugly woman.
[00:16:13.524 --> 00:16:21.105]  If the choice they were making was between giving the libertarian party 5% or potentially electing Donald Trump.
[00:16:21.125 --> 00:16:24.286]  Because you guys don't have a chance against Donald Trump and she does.
[00:16:24.306 --> 00:16:27.447]  And if they vote for you, they would be helping you elect Donald Trump.
[00:16:27.967 --> 00:16:33.149]  The Libertarian Party hasn't treated you great if they're putting out statements that you disagree with over your own name.
[00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:39.573]  Even now, just one week before the election, I can't imagine that your loyalty to them is stronger than your fear of Trump.
[00:16:39.593 --> 00:16:40.193]  She sets it up.
[00:16:40.213 --> 00:16:52.979]  Well, I'm here vouching for Mrs. Clinton, and I think it's high time somebody did, and I'm doing it based on my personal experience with her, and I think she deserves... That's Governor Will, also known as the sack of S-H-N-O-A-T.
[00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:59.421]  So he's, I mean, listen, gloves are off, we're down to the wire, it's D-Day, it's Election Day.
[00:16:59.441 --> 00:17:02.082]  Just to be honest, Stone, come on.
[00:17:02.542 --> 00:17:08.064]  I mean, somebody needs to be... I'm just telling you right now, what do you have to say about these two?
[00:17:08.104 --> 00:17:13.546]  Well, I'm really glad you asked this question, but let me dissect this for you at a slightly deeper level.
[00:17:15.507 --> 00:17:18.768]  First of all, I have great affection and great respect for Gary Johnson.
[00:17:19.901 --> 00:17:24.205]  Gary Johnson's record as governor of New Mexico is exemplary.
[00:17:24.965 --> 00:17:26.166]  Yeah, he had a pretty good record.
[00:17:26.186 --> 00:17:27.187]  Now he's betrayed everybody.
[00:17:27.467 --> 00:17:29.129]  Okay, just hear me out.
[00:17:30.529 --> 00:17:34.130]  And frankly, he made a very valiant charge four years ago.
[00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:35.350]  I was proud to be for him.
[00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.831]  I'm proud to say I voted for him.
[00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:41.452]  I'm proud to say I helped him get on the ballot and worked with a lot of other great people in that party.
[00:17:41.632 --> 00:17:43.112]  And he is a terrific guy.
[00:17:44.293 --> 00:17:56.076]  And in all honesty, it is curious to me that four years ago, when I was looking for a running mate for him, and I really wanted former Congressman Barry Goldwater Jr.,
[00:17:58.618 --> 00:18:02.161]  There are a lot of people who wanted Alex Jones, by the way, but we'll come back to that.
[00:18:02.241 --> 00:18:03.121]  Well, Barry Goldwater Jr.
[00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:05.603]  is awesome.
[00:18:05.743 --> 00:18:08.625]  I also had a thought of Bill Weld.
[00:18:08.705 --> 00:18:18.632]  Now, understand that I was most familiar with Bill Weld, whom I consider a friend even today, when he was the governor of Massachusetts.
[00:18:19.213 --> 00:18:20.033]  And he was very
[00:18:21.676 --> 00:18:25.700]  Anti-government and very pro-freedom in those days.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:30.023]  He only flipped on guns later, which I did not know.
[00:18:31.204 --> 00:18:36.849]  And I was unaware of the fact that he had supported both the Iraq War and the Patriot Act.
[00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.672]  I'm also deeply concerned that when he was a U.S.
[00:18:40.752 --> 00:18:46.997]  attorney, he was appointed by the Bushes in essentially an effort to get Lyndon LaRouche.
[00:18:47.037 --> 00:18:49.680]  Now, Lyndon LaRouche is out there in terms of what he believes.
[00:18:50.646 --> 00:18:56.698]  But he does have a right to criticize old man Bush and they put him away on trumped up charges and that is what he was guilty of.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.563]  Yeah, no, credit card fraud, which wasn't even credit card fraud.
[00:19:01.623 --> 00:19:04.284]  It was a setup, because this guy pissed the old man off.
[00:19:04.344 --> 00:19:05.605]  He was running for president.
[00:19:06.666 --> 00:19:09.708]  And half of the things he said, you know, appeared to me to be true.
[00:19:09.948 --> 00:19:11.209]  Or more.
[00:19:11.229 --> 00:19:14.391]  Well, sure, he advised Reagan, and Reagan liked him.
[00:19:14.451 --> 00:19:20.535]  He had some strange views that I don't agree with, but he was silenced because
[00:19:20.555 --> 00:19:21.935]  Because he was a critic, period.
[00:19:22.256 --> 00:19:22.876]  Leave it there.
[00:19:22.896 --> 00:19:25.396]  Well good, I agree with you on everything else.
[00:19:25.416 --> 00:19:26.637]  So here's my point, Alex.
[00:19:27.297 --> 00:19:31.618]  When I approached Weld, he dismissed me in a nanosecond.
[00:19:32.138 --> 00:19:32.419]  Me?
[00:19:32.519 --> 00:19:34.659]  Run for Vice President with Gary Johnson?
[00:19:34.699 --> 00:19:36.260]  Come on, Roger, I'm a Republican.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.081]  I'm already in trouble because I was for Obama.
[00:19:40.141 --> 00:19:41.121]  Let's just leave it there.
[00:19:41.321 --> 00:19:43.842]  And we had a nice drink at the Harvard Club.
[00:19:45.132 --> 00:19:56.920]  This time, I'm curious that Gary, who's a fine fellow but barely knew Bill Weld, their governorships did overlap a little bit, and that Weld immediately said yes.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:57.840]  Immediately.
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:01.523]  Now, Bill has always wanted to be an ambassador.
[00:20:02.062 --> 00:20:02.742]  Well sure, exactly.
[00:20:02.802 --> 00:20:03.523]  It's very clear.
[00:20:03.843 --> 00:20:08.866]  And he has been a very skillful surrogate for Hillary Clinton, and he has skewered my man, Donald Trump.
[00:20:09.386 --> 00:20:10.506]  And this ain't beanbagged.
[00:20:11.027 --> 00:20:15.189]  But I don't blame Gary for that, because in all honesty, I think Gary got beanbagged.
[00:20:16.056 --> 00:20:16.576]  Exactly.
[00:20:16.596 --> 00:20:17.516]  No, no, I agree.
[00:20:17.536 --> 00:20:18.897]  I don't know if he's a stroke or what he's had.
[00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:20.077]  He's not the same guy no years ago.
[00:20:20.457 --> 00:20:25.279]  But clearly, the three points he's got in many states could be what hands Hillary the victory.
[00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:28.560]  So I just hope he's... And I support him too.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.920]  I'm not bashing you for supporting him.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:35.562]  In all honesty, I think all of Gary's effort lacks is good staff work.
[00:20:35.782 --> 00:20:39.443]  They put him out there on the road and he's not getting the kind of staff support that he needs.
[00:20:39.483 --> 00:20:42.524]  He's actually a very charming and thoughtful guy.
[00:20:43.224 --> 00:20:48.126]  Well, you know, you're not having to worry about whether he's taking the bus to Sandusky for his next appearance.
[00:20:48.526 --> 00:20:48.927]  Exactly.
[00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:51.368]  All right, Roger Stone, you're going to go to sleep.
[00:20:51.408 --> 00:20:52.248]  You deserve some sleep.
[00:20:53.068 --> 00:20:54.049]  You're going to fly out in the morning.
[00:20:54.069 --> 00:20:55.149]  You're going to be here tomorrow for the show.
[00:20:55.489 --> 00:20:56.470]  We're broadcasting 52 hours.
[00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.191]  We're already over 12 hours into that.
[00:20:58.211 --> 00:21:02.692]  We're going right through Wednesday here at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:21:03.193 --> 00:21:05.954]  Anything else you'd like to impart before election day begins?
[00:21:07.287 --> 00:21:16.489]  Well, it is very interesting to try to parse the effect of the whole Comey last-minute stand-up.
[00:21:17.149 --> 00:21:20.490]  There is great unhappiness at the New York Police Department.
[00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:36.873]  Some sources in the police department have told, I'm told that they have told former Mayor Rudy Giuliani that these files do in fact have solid evidence of a consortium of crimes
[00:21:38.068 --> 00:21:42.212]  The files appear to be essentially, in some cases, blackmail files.
[00:21:43.833 --> 00:21:46.735]  There are government documents here that have just been forwarded.
[00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:55.182]  There are all kinds of things that would be, again, the same words that I've heard from other police sources.
[00:21:55.862 --> 00:21:56.363]  Treason.
[00:21:57.524 --> 00:21:58.344]  Profiteering.
[00:21:58.424 --> 00:21:59.245]  Pay for play.
[00:22:00.086 --> 00:22:00.666]  Corruption.
[00:22:01.727 --> 00:22:04.009]  Sexual exploitation of children, again.
[00:22:06.235 --> 00:22:12.938]  You know, extraordinary documents pertaining to the Clinton Foundation.
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:29.228]  We know that the FBI is aware that the nation of Serbia was shaken down for two million dollars
[00:22:30.501 --> 00:22:38.109]  To be laundered and given to the Clinton Foundation in return for a meeting between the President of Serbia and Barack Obama.
[00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:41.973]  Which evidently the Secretary of State was going to broker.
[00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:48.519]  The President of Serbia has been trying to see the President of the United States every year since Barack Obama has been President.
[00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:50.802]  And that hasn't happened.
[00:22:52.143 --> 00:22:53.605]  And here's the best part, Alex.
[00:22:54.546 --> 00:23:00.674]  After the Serbs made the deal with the Clintons, they didn't have the money, so they went to the CIA, and the CIA gave them the money.
[00:23:01.716 --> 00:23:08.585]  Which just shows how it's based on the CIA, whatever providence those are running our government, and so here's the good news.
[00:23:09.738 --> 00:23:18.184]  Hillary will go down even if she steals this election unless she just brings in a total tyranny and can dominate everybody and totally perfect her corruption.
[00:23:19.625 --> 00:23:26.389]  We're going to have a massive, I mean you're absolutely right here, the intelligence community is I think split.
[00:23:26.489 --> 00:23:38.437]  My guess is that the NSA types are probably ultimately aligned with some of the career FBI guys who are sick of seeing crimes being covered up and not being prosecuted.
[00:23:40.078 --> 00:23:49.123]  Police Department, who says that, who has now seen the explosive nature of these files.
[00:23:50.343 --> 00:23:54.946]  And the files, as we have now learned, have been sent to the Republicans in Congress.
[00:23:55.586 --> 00:23:57.327]  They have a full set of the files.
[00:23:58.268 --> 00:24:00.949]  There may, who knows, be impeachable offenses here.
[00:24:01.904 --> 00:24:11.393]  You have to see how this plays out, but these people are running out the clock, and Comey, as you know, has covered for them in the
[00:24:13.076 --> 00:24:18.481]  And he does their taxes and he's flip-flopped four times on this.
[00:24:18.821 --> 00:24:20.983]  The guy's a complete joke.
[00:24:21.283 --> 00:24:26.428]  And they have him on the HSBC bank board so he's in bed with them economically.
[00:24:26.448 --> 00:24:33.295]  I mean you just have some extraordinary exchanges here but it is not possible.
[00:24:35.116 --> 00:24:38.577]  That this kind of stopgap of there's no crimes here can last.
[00:24:38.637 --> 00:24:40.678]  Too many people, in my opinion, have the evidence.
[00:24:40.898 --> 00:24:41.218]  That's right.
[00:24:41.238 --> 00:24:42.679]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[00:24:42.719 --> 00:24:43.059]  All right.
[00:24:43.339 --> 00:24:44.960]  We look forward to having you in the studio tomorrow.
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.581]  Congratulations on the success of the Supreme Court.
[00:24:48.001 --> 00:24:49.901]  Obviously not involved in voter intimidation.
[00:24:49.921 --> 00:24:51.362]  You're doing classic exit polling.
[00:24:51.742 --> 00:24:52.703]  That's why it blew up in their face.
[00:24:52.743 --> 00:24:54.063]  Hillary in panic right now.
[00:24:54.623 --> 00:24:57.044]  Looks like Trump is about to take it, but there is election fraud.
[00:24:57.364 --> 00:24:58.325]  We will track it all.
[00:24:58.705 --> 00:25:00.626]  Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com.
[00:25:00.666 --> 00:25:00.946]  Thank you.
[00:25:01.406 --> 00:25:10.651]  And we would like to be able to get cheeseburgers to some of our poll workers, so please go to StopTheSteal.org and send somebody to help the cause.
[00:25:11.291 --> 00:25:11.891]  Absolutely.
[00:25:12.612 --> 00:25:14.893]  There goes Roger Stone, he's on a plane at 6 a.m.
[00:25:14.933 --> 00:25:15.473]  and joining us.
[00:25:15.693 --> 00:25:23.797]  Just briefly, we're doing this 52-hour broadcast, it's on a lot of AM and FM stations, global, satellite, you name it, but on the Internet's where we're dominating.
[00:25:25.118 --> 00:25:25.298]  I mean,
[00:25:26.397 --> 00:25:34.159]  We've got 7 or 8 YouTube feeds, we've got Facebook feeds, where we're getting 5, 6, 7 million views a day just there.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.861]  And, I mean, CNN doesn't have that on their average shows, 200,000 viewers.
[00:25:38.501 --> 00:25:44.903]  So, what's exciting is you're out there spreading the word about InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.942]  We've got an average of 300,000, 400,000 people tuned in.
[00:25:49.783 --> 00:25:52.245]  That's just our little video stream, not all the other platforms.
[00:25:52.345 --> 00:25:53.706]  This is scaring the system.
[00:25:54.306 --> 00:26:00.692]  And we're churning out viral videos, clips of the show on YouTube and Facebook that are getting millions of views a day as well.
[00:26:01.232 --> 00:26:03.694]  And I'm not bragging, it's just an example of how powerful you are.
[00:26:03.714 --> 00:26:07.717]  Infowars is now 170 on the web today, according to Comcast.
[00:26:08.258 --> 00:26:10.499]  Bigger than the BBC, bigger than the Wall Street Journal.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.421]  Bigger than CNN.
[00:26:12.462 --> 00:26:14.044]  These people are an illusion.
[00:26:14.064 --> 00:26:14.685]  They're a joke.
[00:26:15.145 --> 00:26:18.069]  But how big we are is really a testament to how small they are.
[00:26:18.109 --> 00:26:18.750]  We're not that big.
[00:26:19.271 --> 00:26:19.752]  You're big.
[00:26:20.012 --> 00:26:20.793]  You're taking action.
[00:26:20.833 --> 00:26:21.374]  You're speaking out.
[00:26:21.654 --> 00:26:23.437]  I mean, just InfoWars is dwarfing them.
[00:26:23.717 --> 00:26:24.518]  That's just our website.
[00:26:25.159 --> 00:26:26.341]  Most of what we do isn't on the website.
[00:26:27.717 --> 00:26:51.781]  And we're running a special during this 52-hour broadcast with free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com on high-quality vitamins and minerals and nutraceuticals and storable foods and non-GMO heirloom seeds and amazing wind turbine power systems and high-quality solar panel systems and DNA Force, the over-the-top nootropic slash mitochondrial cleansing system by Mitsubishi America.

[00:26:52.641 --> 00:26:55.402]  Bio-PQQ is the true organic form of it.
[00:26:55.822 --> 00:26:56.882]  Almost no one else has this.
[00:26:57.873 --> 00:26:59.555]  I mean, it is the Rolls-Royce.
[00:26:59.575 --> 00:27:00.436]  Colloidal Silver.

[00:27:31.004 --> 00:27:33.205]  We have the great Biome Defense.
[00:27:33.525 --> 00:27:34.586]  Just amazing.
[00:27:34.706 --> 00:27:35.667]  We have the top firms.
[00:27:35.987 --> 00:27:37.528]  Give you the very best probiotic.
[00:27:37.808 --> 00:27:38.488]  Then discount it.
[00:27:39.649 --> 00:27:40.390]  But look regardless.
[00:27:41.476 --> 00:27:43.558]  We don't just sit here and bitch and say, send us a donation.
[00:27:43.578 --> 00:27:46.682]  The whole point is we are wrecking the globalists.
[00:27:46.722 --> 00:27:49.725]  We are having world-changing effects.
[00:27:50.586 --> 00:27:58.515]  And I sell, if I go to Cabela's and like some weird little cook stove I find, I'd go and buy 10,000 of them and sell them at a discount.
[00:27:58.555 --> 00:27:59.256]  This is what I do.
[00:28:00.711 --> 00:28:02.613]  That's what we do at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:28:02.973 --> 00:28:11.060]  You're just shopping with the good guys and funding a message of pro-gun, pro-family, pro-private property, pro-get-out-of-my-business operations.
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:12.461]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:28:12.501 --> 00:28:15.483]  Now, I want to bring in McAdoo to pop in and get her view on things in a few minutes.
[00:28:15.503 --> 00:28:17.385]  I want to get big zingers that are like, hey, we want to be on air.
[00:28:17.405 --> 00:28:18.046]  I'm like, well, come on.
[00:28:18.066 --> 00:28:18.906]  I haven't seen them yet.
[00:28:19.487 --> 00:28:21.228]  But we're broadcasting worldwide here.
[00:28:21.589 --> 00:28:22.890]  They'll be back on with us in a few days.
[00:28:24.281 --> 00:28:25.441]  This gentleman is very informative.
[00:28:25.761 --> 00:28:26.842]  He's a best-selling author.
[00:28:26.902 --> 00:28:33.884]  He has written the book, Brian Toomey, The Fix Is In, where an NFL ticket admits this is entertainment.
[00:28:34.344 --> 00:28:35.845]  Now, it's not all fake, but a lot of it is.
[00:28:36.405 --> 00:28:37.525]  And the basketball and all of it.
[00:28:37.585 --> 00:28:41.646]  And so, the parallels to sports, it's coming out election fraud.
[00:28:41.686 --> 00:28:43.107]  It's coming out vote rigging.
[00:28:43.927 --> 00:28:52.210]  It's coming out, he's written Legacy Games, A Season of Abyss, Disaster Government, and he's an ESPN contributor, you name it.
[00:28:54.190 --> 00:29:00.166]  He does shows with Dan Patrick looking at how if people can't admit lotteries and sports are rigged...
[00:29:01.343 --> 00:29:03.405]  How do I not admit politics is rigged?
[00:29:03.745 --> 00:29:06.747]  The good news is, Trump's calling it out for rigged.
[00:29:07.228 --> 00:29:15.334]  They say he's crazy, even as they appoint UN overseers and EU overseers to quote, stop Trump fixing it with the Russians.
[00:29:15.374 --> 00:29:16.615]  So what's a bigger conspiracy theory?
[00:29:17.116 --> 00:29:19.137]  Trump and the Russians, and I'm a Russian agent.
[00:29:19.538 --> 00:29:20.138]  Duh, duh.
[00:29:20.438 --> 00:29:21.299]  Oh, what does that put them?
[00:29:21.319 --> 00:29:21.539]  Thank you.
[00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:22.880]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:29:23.201 --> 00:29:24.742]  But then Trump's crazy.
[00:29:24.942 --> 00:29:27.744]  Election fraud doesn't exist, but there's massive fraud.
[00:29:27.985 --> 00:29:29.426]  We've got to trust Obama and Hillary.
[00:29:31.027 --> 00:29:32.888]  What do you think?
[00:29:33.248 --> 00:29:33.808]  Well, you're right.
[00:29:33.868 --> 00:29:39.829]  It's funny because, you know, I investigate game fixing in sports, professional sports, all the different sports.
[00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:46.271]  And one of the biggest hurdles is just getting people to recognize that this is a very real possibility.
[00:29:46.851 --> 00:29:49.332]  And I think it's the same with potential election fraud.
[00:29:49.352 --> 00:29:56.914]  I think there's just too many people who think, you know, we're America, we're democracy, and therefore this sort of thing is impossible and can't happen.
[00:29:57.694 --> 00:30:06.436]  And if it's just that solid mindset that it can't happen, then you won't believe it's possible and anybody who brings up that idea is talking conspiracy theory.
[00:30:06.776 --> 00:30:14.278]  But the very real fact is, is from my investigation into sports, sports have been fixed and continue to be fixed in all realms.
[00:30:15.058 --> 00:30:17.339]  So, you know, you have to get over that mindset.
[00:30:17.379 --> 00:30:22.320]  And it's the same with, I think, our election is we have to realize it's a very real possibility that
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.401]  You know, election fraud can happen.
[00:30:25.562 --> 00:30:26.342]  It does happen.
[00:30:26.502 --> 00:30:27.403]  Dead people vote.
[00:30:27.483 --> 00:30:28.784]  People vote more than once.
[00:30:29.264 --> 00:30:30.305]  Vote early, vote often.
[00:30:30.405 --> 00:30:32.346]  All those things are a very real possibility.
[00:30:32.846 --> 00:30:38.790]  And that can affect the future of this country if we don't open our eyes and recognize that this can and does happen.
[00:30:40.692 --> 00:30:42.313]  Well, I mean, they admit it happens.
[00:30:42.653 --> 00:30:45.035]  And, again, we're not trying to just disenchant and go,
[00:30:46.089 --> 00:30:47.430]  Are you trying to make people not vote?
[00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:48.110]  No!
[00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:49.911]  No.
[00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:56.054]  People fought since Magna Carta for the right of representation in 1215 at the Battle of Runnymede.
[00:30:57.075 --> 00:30:57.695]  It's not that.
[00:30:58.355 --> 00:30:59.876]  We want to have integrity.
[00:31:00.656 --> 00:31:02.397]  We want there to not be intimidation.
[00:31:02.717 --> 00:31:04.018]  We want the truth to come out.
[00:31:04.298 --> 00:31:05.799]  We want all the fraud to stop.
[00:31:06.219 --> 00:31:07.260]  That's how we fix it.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.561]  There's this attitude of just shut up and accept it.
[00:31:10.984 --> 00:31:12.004]  Well, I think you're right.
[00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:19.447]  Another thing is that the media is the one that I think continues to provoke this idea that you shut up and accept it, like you said.
[00:31:19.507 --> 00:31:22.888]  I mean, I've ran into that with investigating sports.
[00:31:22.948 --> 00:31:25.389]  I've run into pushback from ESPN.
[00:31:25.409 --> 00:31:31.432]  I've run into pushback from other media outlets within the sports world that says, we don't want to publish this sort of information.
[00:31:31.492 --> 00:31:37.614]  We don't want to have the type of stories you write because we don't want to make it, you know, basically public knowledge.
[00:31:38.274 --> 00:31:47.220]  And yet no one else within the sports media realm is willing to take game fixing and the integrity of sports really seriously.
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:54.564]  And it doesn't matter if it's, you know, soccer fixing in Europe or rugby fixing or, you know, the cricket industry in India.
[00:31:55.025 --> 00:32:05.111]  I mean, all of these sports worldwide, we can recognize and see people getting arrested and convicted for fixing games, for throwing matches, for all sorts of corruption in the sports.
[00:32:05.171 --> 00:32:06.192]  But here in the United States,
[00:32:06.812 --> 00:32:14.537]  Our sports media, which funds professional sports, says it doesn't exist, says it can't exist, and they don't spend any time or money to look into it.
[00:32:14.637 --> 00:32:30.889]  And if it's the same thing in politics, where they're saying, you can't have fixed elections, you can't have this sort of fraud, but yet no one's willing to really go and dig for it, to look for such examples of it, well then the people are going to think that's true, even though it's not, because they're just putting up a false front.
[00:32:33.527 --> 00:32:37.808]  Well, my friend, we appreciate Brian joining us, TheFixIsIn.net.
[00:32:37.828 --> 00:32:39.229]  Brian Toohey, thank you so much.
[00:32:39.289 --> 00:32:39.929]  Best-selling author.
[00:32:39.949 --> 00:32:41.369]  We'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[00:32:41.729 --> 00:32:47.931]  Now, I've got a few clips I want to play, and then we're going to bring my friend Jesse James in here, who's an Austinite and a big Trump supporter.
[00:32:48.371 --> 00:32:49.232]  I should probably print that.
[00:32:49.272 --> 00:32:50.032]  I forgot to print it.
[00:32:50.612 --> 00:32:59.835]  There's an article out of Breitbart and a bunch of others where Donald Trump is announcing a new initiative, a pro-Second Amendment initiative.
[00:33:00.675 --> 00:33:03.878]  Whether he wins or loses, as he's been saying, hey, they steal this from me?
[00:33:04.379 --> 00:33:04.799]  Whatever.
[00:33:05.099 --> 00:33:06.281]  Defeat the TPP.
[00:33:09.484 --> 00:33:12.827]  So, that is just some of what's unfolding.
[00:33:13.367 --> 00:33:14.188]  We don't quit.
[00:33:14.829 --> 00:33:15.830]  Trump isn't gonna quit.
[00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:17.672]  You know, the media spins it and goes...
[00:33:19.403 --> 00:33:22.625]  This is all a stunt to start a media empire to rival Fox and CNN.
[00:33:23.646 --> 00:33:26.268]  He's just getting a database of patriots to run a liberty network.
[00:33:26.308 --> 00:33:27.329]  Well, good, good.
[00:33:27.369 --> 00:33:27.929]  That's wonderful.
[00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:30.451]  He's trying to win the presidency.
[00:33:30.771 --> 00:33:33.333]  If they steal it or whatever, we continue on.
[00:33:33.413 --> 00:33:34.273]  We don't give up.
[00:33:34.494 --> 00:33:35.294]  We don't give in.
[00:33:36.295 --> 00:33:39.177]  We've come from... I was talking about stuff 21 years ago.
[00:33:39.197 --> 00:33:41.499]  People thought I was a five-headed space alien.
[00:33:42.406 --> 00:33:46.087]  A one-horned, one-eyed, flying purple people eater.
[00:33:46.947 --> 00:33:50.188]  Now, all over the world what we're doing is popular.
[00:33:50.508 --> 00:33:51.589]  People are awake.
[00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:53.369]  That's what this is all about.
[00:33:53.969 --> 00:33:54.910]  That's what we're doing.
[00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:58.711]  If you go to my Twitter, realAlexJones, you can see Jesse James.
[00:33:58.731 --> 00:34:04.592]  He sent me this funny image and I sent it to the folks who tweet out where I'm making my goofy, you know, scary face because the media asked me to do it.
[00:34:04.612 --> 00:34:05.913]  He's doing one, shooting his gun.
[00:34:07.182 --> 00:34:11.465]  But he's a firearms manufacturer, a metalsmith, I don't know all the current terms, but he's over at his house.
[00:34:12.026 --> 00:34:15.789]  It's like Festus or Vulcan's home with a big fire shooting out.
[00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:22.154]  He's in like these big 1950s spacesuits and they're beating on big glowing pieces of metal.
[00:34:22.254 --> 00:34:26.297]  It's like the beginning of the movie Conan the Barbarian or something, except it's really happening.
[00:34:27.058 --> 00:34:30.460]  So he's going to be in here talking about the whole state of the world with us.
[00:34:31.521 --> 00:34:42.567]  It's at FreeJesseJames or JJFU.com and it's just very exciting to see a firearms manufacturer, a patriot, and somebody that first got to endorse Donald Trump.
[00:34:43.908 --> 00:34:45.648]  The first guy to tell me, hey, you know Donald Trump's a patriot.
[00:34:45.668 --> 00:34:46.309]  I'm like, Donald Trump?
[00:34:46.329 --> 00:34:47.269]  I don't know anything about Donald Trump.
[00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:49.650]  So that's all coming up with us.
[00:34:49.771 --> 00:34:51.511]  I've got a bunch of clips I want to play here.
[00:34:51.531 --> 00:34:55.173]  We've got Clinton aids his foundation-paid Chelsea wedding.
[00:34:55.493 --> 00:34:56.494]  WikiLeaks email show.
[00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:57.354]  Oh, give me a break.
[00:34:57.635 --> 00:34:58.295]  They stole.
[00:35:00.455 --> 00:35:01.316]  Billions of dollars.
[00:35:01.356 --> 00:35:07.199]  They became the national, worldwide focus point to give money for Haiti, and it stole 94% of it.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.140]  And we got them in the WikiLeaks.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.501]  See, people say, where's the bombshell?
[00:35:10.521 --> 00:35:13.163]  I'm gonna go read the 100,000 plus emails.
[00:35:14.044 --> 00:35:24.050]  Two weeks ago, they released that Obama is in with secret names, communicating with Hillary, and then their own aides are saying, we gotta cover this up, the FBI's after us, it's open and shut.
[00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:26.872]  So, WikiLeaks delivered the red meat.
[00:35:27.711 --> 00:35:30.373]  Don't sit there, because the mainstream media won't tell you about it.
[00:35:31.033 --> 00:35:32.414]  I'm not telling our audiences, but some people.
[00:35:32.674 --> 00:35:33.675]  And then bitch about it.
[00:35:34.415 --> 00:35:36.877]  And then say, well, why is she in trouble?
[00:35:37.037 --> 00:35:43.061]  We got a whore media that'll stand by while they rob everything we've got if we don't wake up.
[00:35:43.101 --> 00:35:44.362]  Listen, I'll say it again.
[00:35:44.862 --> 00:35:50.445]  Kennedy cut taxes in the general tax bracket from blue collar to middle class by 50 percent.
[00:35:50.666 --> 00:35:52.147]  Five zero percent.
[00:35:53.267 --> 00:35:55.529]  Tax receipts, rich people got a 30 percent cut.
[00:35:56.348 --> 00:35:58.229]  Tax receipts double within two years.
[00:35:58.770 --> 00:35:59.950]  They already know that.
[00:36:00.411 --> 00:36:01.992]  You cut taxes, more money comes in.
[00:36:02.252 --> 00:36:05.434]  The average dumbass that never ran a business goes, what do you mean?
[00:36:06.074 --> 00:36:07.175]  More taxes mean more money.
[00:36:07.495 --> 00:36:09.817]  No, more taxes means a stalled economy.
[00:36:11.498 --> 00:36:17.062]  No oxygen in the engine as the pistons are going down.
[00:36:18.883 --> 00:36:20.304]  They want control.
[00:36:20.644 --> 00:36:21.745]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:36:25.086 --> 00:36:29.795]  And that's why Trump, who isn't out, his slogan should be, Trump, not out to get us!
[00:36:30.711 --> 00:36:32.331]  Just let us go back to America.
[00:36:32.671 --> 00:36:34.572]  Let's go back to what made us the greatest nation in the world.
[00:36:34.992 --> 00:36:36.372]  Lower taxes, less regulations.
[00:36:36.812 --> 00:36:37.432]  Let us go back.
[00:36:37.993 --> 00:36:44.434]  But I forgot a bunch of assholes in the media, a bunch of pieces of filth, a bunch of traitors made deals with China.
[00:36:44.714 --> 00:36:45.754]  Oh, you got a billion slaves.
[00:36:45.974 --> 00:36:46.514]  Let's make a deal.
[00:36:46.554 --> 00:36:50.775]  We put regulations on America and then we in England and Europe and we move over here and we get part of the money.
[00:36:51.055 --> 00:36:57.737]  A bunch of Chinese generals are now so rich off our money, they're going, we're buying Walmart, we're buying Hollywood.
[00:36:58.397 --> 00:37:00.318]  Sure, we're going to tell you what movie you can put out.
[00:37:00.639 --> 00:37:01.319]  I got an idea.
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.021]  How about China go jump in a lake?
[00:37:04.061 --> 00:37:05.782]  And by the way, China's always been enemies with Russia.
[00:37:06.463 --> 00:37:11.226]  That's why there's this whole Russia-phobe thing, because not that Russia's perfect, but they're not in our business.
[00:37:11.846 --> 00:37:13.908]  China is the enemy, not Chinese people.
[00:37:14.328 --> 00:37:18.671]  China, the communists that have mobile execution vans killing their own citizens.
[00:37:19.011 --> 00:37:19.992]  They're the problem.
[00:37:20.412 --> 00:37:27.417]  I saw some new Vanity Fair article today on Chinese government makes fun of Americans that are upset about their takeover of Hollywood.
[00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:38.853]  Now, we're going to get David Knight to pop in a little while, but I was talking to Biggs, I was talking to Liam, they wanted to come in.
[00:37:39.854 --> 00:37:42.916]  That's why for an hour I've been saying, hell, more than an hour, come on in here.
[00:37:43.136 --> 00:37:44.837]  I know Knight loves to talk, we love Knight.
[00:37:45.057 --> 00:37:45.898]  We want to get him in here.
[00:37:46.238 --> 00:37:48.780]  But I got Jesse James coming in here in 15 minutes, I got plenty of clips.
[00:37:49.741 --> 00:37:52.603]  I was just talking to them, they were like, hey, we want to come on here, so that's why I said that.
[00:37:52.903 --> 00:37:54.284]  Hell, I could talk for 50 hours.
[00:37:54.704 --> 00:37:55.265]  I don't need that.
[00:37:55.925 --> 00:37:57.026]  Who bought them TVs, bitches?
[00:37:57.046 --> 00:37:57.466]  Tell me that!
[00:37:58.007 --> 00:37:59.107]  Now, we're done.
[00:37:59.127 --> 00:38:00.548]  We're going to have James come in here, that's what we're doing.
[00:38:00.889 --> 00:38:02.410]  Now, before we go any further here,
[00:38:04.667 --> 00:38:06.589]  This is all about taking action, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:14.839]  And I don't want to just have 10 million extra views tomorrow on YouTube and Facebook and Periscope and everywhere else.
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.162]  I want to be at 50 million.
[00:38:17.843 --> 00:38:19.945]  And then by Wednesday, I want to have 100 billion.
[00:38:21.367 --> 00:38:21.968]  That's what I want.
[00:38:23.903 --> 00:38:25.444]  And that's not that big a deal.
[00:38:25.464 --> 00:38:26.344]  We've already done that.
[00:38:26.865 --> 00:38:33.828]  Let's just rub CNN and MSNBC's nose in it and go, oh, during the election you had 10 million viewers, which you were about to collapse.
[00:38:33.848 --> 00:38:34.549]  That's big for you.
[00:38:34.909 --> 00:38:36.210]  Oh, we had 100 million.
[00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:37.370]  Look how pathetic you are.
[00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:40.012]  Not to be dominant, but they want to dominate us.
[00:38:40.072 --> 00:38:41.112]  We want to say, oh, really?
[00:38:41.512 --> 00:38:42.393]  We're going to defeat you.
[00:38:43.333 --> 00:38:48.016]  So I'm going to air Hillary Clinton's darkest secrets will be revealed.
[00:38:49.946 --> 00:38:52.249]  Then we've got confirmed Newsweek prepares for Hillary victory.
[00:38:52.269 --> 00:38:53.890]  They're already printing stuff that she's winning.
[00:38:54.511 --> 00:38:55.972]  Whether she steals it or not, we win.
[00:38:56.553 --> 00:39:00.718]  And then we're going to play a few more clips and bring Jesse James in here and get into what's happening.
[00:39:00.738 --> 00:39:06.924]  But bottom line, Trump's a winner no matter what by getting in the field, getting in the arena, and taking action.
[00:39:08.726 --> 00:39:12.247]  We're now 13 hours into the 52-hour broadcast.
[00:39:12.707 --> 00:39:13.467]  Right through tomorrow.
[00:39:13.767 --> 00:39:16.707]  Spread the links at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:39:17.227 --> 00:39:19.428]  The YouTube links, the Facebook links, all of them.
[00:39:19.948 --> 00:39:20.468]  It's amazing.
[00:39:20.528 --> 00:39:23.729]  It's not just our big live links that have millions on them.
[00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:27.609]  We have lots of little clips we're doing with hundreds of thousands and millions.
[00:39:28.009 --> 00:39:30.750]  Hell, one clip this week had, what, 15 million views.
[00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:33.790]  I mean, this is all about kicking media's ass.
[00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:35.251]  Just dominating.
[00:39:35.311 --> 00:39:37.171]  I mean, hammering the hell out of them.
[00:39:37.831 --> 00:39:40.653]  Victory upon victory upon victory upon victory.
[00:39:41.034 --> 00:39:44.576]  We have to show them how pathetic they are, the snot noses at CNN.
[00:39:44.917 --> 00:39:46.078]  We have to overrun them.
[00:39:46.318 --> 00:39:47.439]  We have to dominate them.
[00:39:47.479 --> 00:39:49.740]  We have to break them, because they wanted to break us.
[00:39:50.001 --> 00:39:51.182]  They're bullies that wanted a fight.
[00:39:51.202 --> 00:39:54.044]  They're gonna get one.
[00:39:55.245 --> 00:39:56.186]  But here's some of these reports.
[00:39:56.206 --> 00:39:56.606]  We'll be back.
[00:40:08.453 --> 00:40:21.866]  Marina Abramovich, grandmother of the performance art movement and a modern adherent to ceremonial magic found in Aleister Crowley's religion, Thelema, wrote a very personal email to Tony Podesta, according to WikiLeaks.
[00:40:22.186 --> 00:40:27.792]  It reads, Dear Tony, I am so looking forward to the spirit cooking dinner at my place.
[00:40:28.052 --> 00:40:31.835]  Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining?
[00:40:58.132 --> 00:41:01.374]  The spirit world with the material world.
[00:41:01.594 --> 00:41:05.936]  The ritual takes place in the kitchen which is considered to be the heart of the home.
[00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:11.600]  The goal of the ceremony is to convert matter into energy so spirits can feed on it.
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:22.866]  Marina derives her inspiration from the popular belief that spirits still need food even though it is no longer solid but in the form of light, sound, and emotions.
[00:41:23.306 --> 00:41:35.218]  This simple revelation may finally pull back the curtain to the masses on the ugly truth Infowars and others have been desperately trying to tell the masses for years.
[00:41:35.538 --> 00:41:38.381]  The occult is the religion of the elite.
[00:41:38.701 --> 00:41:42.545]  Just research the influence of Lucius Trust in the United Nations.
[00:41:42.845 --> 00:41:45.627]  Or review the 1990 Nebraska U.S.
[00:41:45.707 --> 00:41:55.514]  District Court case between Paul A. Baracki vs. Lawrence E. King, exposing a powerful pedophile ring linked to political figures, high-level U.S.
[00:41:55.574 --> 00:41:58.576]  military commanders, and the intelligence establishment.
[00:41:58.776 --> 00:42:02.599]  All of this overseen by Temple of Set founder and retired U.S.
[00:42:02.679 --> 00:42:03.359]  Army Lt.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:03.740]  Col.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:04.800]  Michael Aquino.
[00:42:05.201 --> 00:42:09.444]  Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton live in this dark world.
[00:42:09.864 --> 00:42:26.797]  Bill Clinton wrote in his biography that the brief foray into the world of voodoo furthered his fascination with the way different cultures try to make sense of life, nature, and the virtually universal belief that there's a non-physical spirit force at work in the world.
[00:42:26.977 --> 00:42:32.482]  Back in September 16th, 2016, Fox News posted a letter from hacker Guccifer.
[00:42:32.802 --> 00:42:40.590]  Claiming the goal of the Guccifer Project failed because he was unable to fully expose the Illuminati, the Council, and their crimes.
[00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:48.959]  He writes, Hillary Rodham Diane Clinton is one of the High Priests, a goddess of this occult, satanic, shadow group.
[00:42:49.299 --> 00:42:54.465]  One must see their evil and profoundly corrupt nature to understand what I am talking about.
[00:42:54.585 --> 00:43:03.333]  Guccifer continues, so I apologize in front of the unknown soldiers who struggle to take this fight against these monsters to a glorious end.
[00:43:03.713 --> 00:43:10.560]  Many of them are risking their lives while doing this behind the computer screens from inside or outside the system.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:16.265]  And now bombshell revelations are surfacing from Anthony Weiner's recovered laptop.
[00:43:16.565 --> 00:43:27.052]  As the New York Police Department is investigating allegations that Bill Clinton performed sexual acts on underage girls as young as five years old.
[00:43:27.512 --> 00:43:40.541]  In the coming days, right up to the election, Anthony Weiner's laptop will reveal evidence of an international child sex trafficking ring tied to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
[00:43:41.357 --> 00:43:47.319]  She's worked like a demon, as you know, as Secretary of State and as a Senator and in the years since.
[00:43:47.659 --> 00:43:52.621]  One thing about Hillary, Bill was just a good-timing guy.
[00:43:52.921 --> 00:43:57.662]  But Hillary, she's an animal.
[00:43:57.702 --> 00:44:03.484]  Hillary is the one that I promise you, she pulls the strings.
[00:44:04.084 --> 00:44:06.205]  She pulled them in Arkansas.
[00:44:06.445 --> 00:44:09.746]  She pulled them in the White House when she was there as the First Lady.
[00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:18.955]  And my God, if she gets to be president, what you see out here now is gonna change.
[00:44:19.015 --> 00:44:20.956]  We thought it changed with Obama.
[00:44:21.096 --> 00:44:23.898]  There's nothing compared to what's gonna happen with Hillary.
[00:44:24.899 --> 00:44:30.262]  If all of this is just a little too much, remember, Benjamin Franklin prophetically said,
[00:44:41.693 --> 00:44:41.861]  Yeah.
[00:44:52.043 --> 00:44:54.725]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:44:54.945 --> 00:44:58.027]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:44:58.287 --> 00:44:59.067]  Because it's already here.
[00:44:59.468 --> 00:45:00.128]  It's being announced.
[00:45:00.468 --> 00:45:03.930]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:45:04.371 --> 00:45:06.292]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:45:06.412 --> 00:45:07.973]  A new battleship in the fight.
[00:45:08.173 --> 00:45:09.154]  InfoWars Live.
[00:45:09.354 --> 00:45:10.194]  Available right now.
[00:45:10.434 --> 00:45:11.815]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[00:45:12.256 --> 00:45:14.637]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[00:45:15.337 --> 00:45:16.258]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[00:45:16.818 --> 00:45:19.820]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:45:20.321 --> 00:45:20.881]  Take action!
[00:45:25.965 --> 00:45:38.136]  Alright folks, this is all part of the continued, ongoing, 52 hours, we're going to go longer than that, everybody knows, as long as you never leave, worldwide broadcast as America tries to get out from under the globalists.
[00:45:38.596 --> 00:45:43.621]  Now Jesse James, who I've known for many years, a great guy, patriot, gunsmith, working with Trump.
[00:45:44.321 --> 00:45:49.105]  I think I need that article that I saw, the reason I talked to him about it, out of
[00:45:50.461 --> 00:45:55.684]  Out of Breitbart, where they're launching this big nationwide initiative, Jesse James and Donald Trump.
[00:45:55.744 --> 00:45:56.345]  So exciting.
[00:45:57.045 --> 00:45:58.206]  Jesse sent it to me a couple days ago.
[00:45:58.226 --> 00:46:01.047]  If you guys want it off my phone, I can give it to you because I want to show folks that.
[00:46:01.407 --> 00:46:04.509]  Donald Trump is launching a national pro-gun initiative.
[00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:05.850]  Very exciting.
[00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:10.053]  The next ten minutes before we air this piece, Michael Moore is a sack of crap by Paul Watson.
[00:46:10.333 --> 00:46:10.973]  Total hypocrite.
[00:46:11.413 --> 00:46:13.274]  You guys are here doing live blogging.
[00:46:13.515 --> 00:46:14.475]  Millions of people.
[00:46:14.515 --> 00:46:17.137]  I mean, little videos we're doing have millions of viewers right now.
[00:46:17.597 --> 00:46:21.758]  We're not bragging to say, oh my God, look, we're like 170 on the web, just one of our websites.
[00:46:22.158 --> 00:46:24.038]  Oh my God, on YouTube, we're like 50 on the web.
[00:46:24.818 --> 00:46:26.579]  The point is, liberty is popular.
[00:46:26.859 --> 00:46:27.719]  That's why we're saying this.
[00:46:27.779 --> 00:46:28.139]  Leigh Ann?
[00:46:28.339 --> 00:46:28.539]  Yeah.
[00:46:29.159 --> 00:46:36.340]  Well, we just shot a Facebook mention speaking of that, and you know, by the time I left the thing, it had already gotten 50,000 views.
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:42.761]  And we did, the topic was on the Clinton Foundation because it's one of the top trending things on Facebook right now.
[00:46:42.901 --> 00:46:46.922]  On the eve of the election, people are really curious about what- They're finally caring.
[00:46:47.262 --> 00:46:51.205]  They're finally caring, because the mainstream media has refused to talk about this.
[00:46:51.465 --> 00:46:57.449]  Most people don't know that the FBI has actually been investigating the Clinton Foundation for more than a year now.
[00:46:57.549 --> 00:47:00.931]  But they've just really made it hush-hush, and they want to tell you, oh, it's no big deal.
[00:47:01.291 --> 00:47:04.793]  Well, if we were dealing with an honest system, it would be a huge deal.
[00:47:05.194 --> 00:47:09.677]  Indictments would be on their way, but we're dealing with James Comey, we're dealing with the DOJ.
[00:47:09.997 --> 00:47:11.178]  And think about this.
[00:47:11.218 --> 00:47:14.500]  If they don't get in some trouble, the frickin' sky's the limit.
[00:47:15.402 --> 00:47:16.102]  What's next?
[00:47:16.122 --> 00:47:18.243]  We made jokes, Hillary can barbecue kids.
[00:47:18.643 --> 00:47:20.803]  Well, we're catching them actually in satanic rituals now.
[00:47:20.963 --> 00:47:21.243]  Right.
[00:47:21.744 --> 00:47:22.524]  The pizza parties.
[00:47:22.584 --> 00:47:28.765]  I mean, if that's not enough to shock people, and I know that when you're dealing with like a cult stuff or child sex... These are $20,000 hot dogs.
[00:47:28.845 --> 00:47:29.946]  It's so terrible.
[00:47:30.066 --> 00:47:35.007]  It's just so evil, so awful that most people refuse to wrap their heads around it.
[00:47:35.167 --> 00:47:35.807]  They just can't.
[00:47:35.827 --> 00:47:36.567]  They can't believe it.
[00:47:36.627 --> 00:47:37.247]  It's too bad.
[00:47:37.347 --> 00:47:41.808]  And yet we're being forced to be told that Hillary Clinton's the popular one, that she's going to have it.
[00:47:41.868 --> 00:47:43.869]  I just watched Right Side Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:49.173]  They were just doing a Facebook Live of Donald Trump's rally in New Hampshire.
[00:47:49.273 --> 00:47:53.236]  140,000 people on Facebook was watching that.
[00:47:53.576 --> 00:47:56.578]  On their YouTube, 70 plus thousand people.
[00:47:57.119 --> 00:48:00.381]  So I took a screenshot of Don Salazar did a similar thing on his Facebook.
[00:48:01.582 --> 00:48:03.803]  Barack Obama's out there speaking, Hillary Clinton, all that.
[00:48:03.824 --> 00:48:04.544]  11,000 people are watching.
[00:48:05.925 --> 00:48:08.726]  By the way, we got more than that.
[00:48:09.066 --> 00:48:11.907]  We're not bragging, it's just, you know, who bought them TVs?
[00:48:11.947 --> 00:48:12.648]  Bitch, tell me that.
[00:48:12.988 --> 00:48:14.028]  Well, see them TVs?
[00:48:14.208 --> 00:48:15.149]  Who bought them?
[00:48:15.169 --> 00:48:17.469]  But now, isn't it, is it Bruce Springsteen?
[00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:24.612]  He's having an emergency midnight thing in Michigan because she's way behind.
[00:48:24.632 --> 00:48:25.773]  I've talked to Stone and others.
[00:48:26.173 --> 00:48:27.894]  She's losing in every state.
[00:48:27.934 --> 00:48:30.094]  That's why Trump, during his speech, he does this.
[00:48:30.154 --> 00:48:30.895]  He goes, look.
[00:48:31.775 --> 00:48:32.556]  Do I have a guitar?
[00:48:32.576 --> 00:48:33.476]  Do I have a piano?
[00:48:33.717 --> 00:48:36.058]  Do you see Jay-Z and Beyonce here?
[00:48:36.078 --> 00:48:38.480]  When she doesn't have them, she gets 300 people.
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:40.141]  Freedom is way more popular.
[00:48:40.402 --> 00:48:42.743]  She's got 40 people, let's be honest.
[00:48:42.763 --> 00:48:42.743]  300?
[00:48:43.104 --> 00:48:43.484]  No.
[00:48:43.744 --> 00:48:47.487]  Well, I mean, the LeBron James deal in Cleveland, she did.
[00:48:47.507 --> 00:48:53.692]  And the cops, the intelligence cops, are sending me photos going, we're here, look, it's only 300.
[00:48:53.972 --> 00:48:56.714]  And then you see the news, the camera's all up close.
[00:48:56.874 --> 00:48:58.776]  Yeah, and most of them are with the press.
[00:48:58.836 --> 00:49:00.317]  They're probably part of her press pool.
[00:49:00.357 --> 00:49:01.519]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:49:01.699 --> 00:49:04.321]  She can't pay people to come to these events.
[00:49:04.542 --> 00:49:09.727]  She has to throw three concerts, and then most of the people are leaving by the time she takes off.
[00:49:09.747 --> 00:49:10.508]  Sure, let me just say this.
[00:49:10.548 --> 00:49:12.269]  We got busy covering the election and everything.
[00:49:12.329 --> 00:49:13.010]  It snuck up on us.
[00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:15.773]  The crew's doing a great job booking who's doing what for two hours.
[00:49:16.213 --> 00:49:19.456]  I was just today like, why aren't Leigh-Anne and Biggs anywhere in this?
[00:49:19.817 --> 00:49:20.558]  Where are the other people?
[00:49:21.098 --> 00:49:30.427]  When we're having these discussions, when I'm hosting or Knight's hosting or anybody, make sure we do roundtables part of it to bring in your own ideas, your own clips of what's going on because, you know, we're seat of our pants right now.
[00:49:30.447 --> 00:49:35.191]  But here it is, Donald Trump launches 2nd Amendment Coalition Breitbart with Jesse James.
[00:49:35.571 --> 00:49:36.572]  How exciting is that?
[00:49:36.592 --> 00:49:38.094]  Very exciting.
[00:49:38.194 --> 00:49:43.519]  I mean, I love it seeing folks like Jesse James, who's always brought the 2nd Amendment, he's now going to actively be out there
[00:49:44.497 --> 00:49:45.377]  Actually fighting.
[00:49:45.458 --> 00:49:51.020]  I mean, imagine once we get all these folks that have just been supporters, but now getting aggressive.
[00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.041]  It's like, this is the next level.
[00:49:53.061 --> 00:49:54.061]  They are in deep crap.
[00:49:54.081 --> 00:49:55.022]  Well, it's funny.
[00:49:55.062 --> 00:49:56.222]  Listen to all these people on TV.
[00:49:56.243 --> 00:50:02.005]  Like if Trump wins Ohio, if he wins North Carolina, if he wins Florida, if he wins Ohio, if he wins Pennsylvania, it's over.
[00:50:02.485 --> 00:50:04.426]  Well, he's looking like he's going to win these.
[00:50:04.526 --> 00:50:05.827]  I mean, I think this could be it.
[00:50:06.067 --> 00:50:15.413]  I agree, but are they arrogant enough, Biggs, because I talked to my Pentagon sources, they're already telling the military, brass, get ready, it's been given to Hillary, even if he wins, don't try anything.
[00:50:15.433 --> 00:50:24.519]  I don't know, I got my Cuban cigar on standby, I've got my Trump flag that's going to go on the back of the truck, me and Owen Troyer, if we get a victory, we're going to do some driving around.
[00:50:24.539 --> 00:50:25.280]  I agree, I agree.
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:30.283]  Tomorrow night, tomorrow night, we're getting a friggin' hotel suite, I want to be able
[00:50:31.596 --> 00:50:35.037]  Well, I guess it'll have to be, because we won't find out until the wee hours of the morning.
[00:50:35.097 --> 00:50:35.737]  No, I'm joking.
[00:50:35.817 --> 00:50:36.577]  Obviously, we don't party.
[00:50:36.597 --> 00:50:37.597]  We would never do that.
[00:50:37.617 --> 00:50:38.077]  Yeah.
[00:50:38.297 --> 00:50:38.918]  Anyways.
[00:50:38.938 --> 00:50:42.598]  I know, I'm going to have like a week of just energy that's going to be built up.
[00:50:42.638 --> 00:50:46.299]  No, listen, they're going to activate, that's a nice question, Soros.
[00:50:46.439 --> 00:50:52.601]  It's over a billion bucks by Globalist spent to cause, kill the cops, burn stuff down, all these diversions, take stuff out.
[00:50:52.681 --> 00:50:53.761]  I'm not just defending the cops.
[00:50:53.801 --> 00:50:56.402]  I mean, the point is, it's just all the diversion by Globalist.
[00:50:56.682 --> 00:50:58.162]  It should be illegal, the sedition.
[00:50:58.563 --> 00:51:00.250]  Of foreign groups trying to cause a civil war.
[00:51:00.271 --> 00:51:00.652]  Right.
[00:51:00.954 --> 00:51:03.184]  If Trump wins, which it looks like he is, what happens?
[00:51:03.976 --> 00:51:11.161]  All I know is this, all my friends in the military, I've got a lot of buddies who have been SEALs, Special Forces Operators, which is U.S.
[00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:18.246]  Army, Rangers, things like that, and on their Facebook pages, and like SF group pages and all that, they're all supporting Trump.
[00:51:18.727 --> 00:51:20.188]  These guys are like, Trump, Trump, Trump.
[00:51:20.208 --> 00:51:21.609]  The entire FBI is Trump-loving.
[00:51:21.629 --> 00:51:27.133]  No one, no one, no one is going to sit here and- Aren't we proud of Jesse James being the first Trump supporter?
[00:51:27.853 --> 00:51:31.136]  He was the first guy on Facebook within minutes of the announcement that endorsed him.
[00:51:31.456 --> 00:51:32.096]  Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:51:32.116 --> 00:51:32.637]  I did not know.
[00:51:33.317 --> 00:51:34.518]  I mean, I've been watching this guy.
[00:51:34.538 --> 00:51:36.579]  I actually met him briefly in Iraq.
[00:51:36.619 --> 00:51:41.822]  He came and did a Monster Garage episode at Balad Air Base in Iraq at Camp Anaconda.
[00:51:41.842 --> 00:51:47.444]  I don't know if he remembers, but they converted a Humvee there and just turned it into this really tricked-out, awesome vehicle.
[00:51:47.905 --> 00:51:51.407]  And since then, that's what made me want to get into welding when I got out.
[00:51:51.807 --> 00:51:54.168]  You'll have to wait until he gets to share the story.
[00:51:54.268 --> 00:51:55.189]  But no, it was pretty awesome.
[00:51:55.229 --> 00:51:55.989]  He can hear about it later.
[00:51:56.009 --> 00:51:58.030]  We'll tell him another time, but it was pretty cool.
[00:51:58.050 --> 00:51:58.410]  It was good stuff.
[00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:59.151]  We're going to get him in here.
[00:51:59.191 --> 00:52:01.772]  Linging on to other points, because we're going to be broadcasting all night long.
[00:52:02.092 --> 00:52:25.711]  Well, Darren McBreen actually brought a story that George Soros, not only does he have his hands in anything that has to do with civil unrest, but he actually spent a lot of millions of dollars working the angle about election fraud, and to try and co-opt that, that message, because a lot of people... Oh yeah, it's in the WikiLeaks, he's like, get Stone, get Jones, we've got to co-opt this, say it doesn't exist, but then we take it over.
[00:52:25.931 --> 00:52:29.573]  Right, and also to change people's perception about voter fraud.
[00:52:29.933 --> 00:52:37.516]  Perfect example with Obama coming out and it's not clear whether or not he told illegal aliens go and vote.
[00:52:37.896 --> 00:52:39.797]  Well he said don't worry, we're not going to enforce on you.
[00:52:39.917 --> 00:52:46.600]  Yeah, don't worry, we're not going to come to your house and find you and no one's going to know because your vote is, it's a secret, it's protected.
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:49.361]  Can I show up in Mexico and I'm going to vote?
[00:52:49.381 --> 00:52:53.403]  I tweeted the Mexican president, I tweeted Francois Hollande of France and all these people.
[00:52:53.643 --> 00:52:56.386]  I was like, can I come into your countries illegally and then vote in your next election?
[00:52:56.466 --> 00:53:00.170]  Yeah, it's like I just show up in Russia or like Nigeria, I'm here to vote!
[00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:01.331]  They'd be like, what the heck?
[00:53:01.411 --> 00:53:06.016]  I'm a total foreigner and now I command that you rearrange your country to suit my needs.
[00:53:06.076 --> 00:53:09.039]  No, you do get a prison cell, or we do break your neck.
[00:53:10.596 --> 00:53:12.177]  Oh man, it's ridiculous.
[00:53:12.237 --> 00:53:16.738]  I mean, we can't go to other countries and live there illegally and I can't vote.
[00:53:16.858 --> 00:53:17.899]  I love the reporter though.
[00:53:17.919 --> 00:53:18.559]  He's a fox.
[00:53:18.579 --> 00:53:21.280]  He's like, I'm a dreamer and I can't vote.
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:21.820]  This is wrong.
[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:23.521]  I live here so I get to vote.
[00:53:23.541 --> 00:53:25.461]  He's like, well, if you vote, you're a citizen.
[00:53:25.481 --> 00:53:25.882]  That's right.
[00:53:25.902 --> 00:53:26.942]  We're not going to check into you.
[00:53:26.962 --> 00:53:29.763]  You can do whatever you want.
[00:53:29.803 --> 00:53:31.844]  Oh man, it's all about rubbing it in.
[00:53:31.864 --> 00:53:33.104]  In fact, this is what he said.
[00:53:33.124 --> 00:53:33.704]  Let's play the clip.
[00:53:33.724 --> 00:53:34.265]  Let's back it up.
[00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:39.710]  I call ourselves citizens because we're citizens.
[00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:41.051]  He's totally breathless.
[00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:42.531]  Here's a clip.
[00:53:43.151 --> 00:53:51.133]  ...of the millennials, dreamers, undocumented citizens, and I call them citizens because they contribute to this country, are fearful of voting.
[00:53:51.273 --> 00:53:54.694]  So if I vote... You gotta go there when you say some BS like that.
[00:53:54.974 --> 00:53:56.674]  ...will they come to my family and deport us?
[00:53:56.714 --> 00:53:58.675]  She just vomits horse shit all over his face.
[00:53:58.695 --> 00:53:58.975]  I'm sorry.
[00:53:58.995 --> 00:53:59.315]  Delay that.
[00:54:00.875 --> 00:54:03.820]  Trump would be like, you're not a citizen, no.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.843]  Yes, as a citizen.
[00:54:05.863 --> 00:54:07.145]  Look at her, she's like, mm-hmm.
[00:54:07.165 --> 00:54:09.588]  My coach says, when you vote, you're a citizen, yeah.
[00:54:09.869 --> 00:54:15.998]  The right to vote is for citizens, not for... Alright, you guys are badasses.
[00:54:16.198 --> 00:54:16.678]  We love you.
[00:54:16.698 --> 00:54:19.859]  I want to get all the reporters from David Knight to McGreen and Rob Dewey.
[00:54:19.879 --> 00:54:20.679]  Everybody coming through here.
[00:54:20.699 --> 00:54:21.499]  This is so exciting.
[00:54:21.879 --> 00:54:22.699]  Spread the links.
[00:54:22.779 --> 00:54:24.540]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.341]  There's a bunch of the links to like the Facebook, the YouTube, all these different streams.
[00:54:30.841 --> 00:54:31.501]  Exclusive!
[00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:38.763]  Troubled woman with a history of drug use who claimed that she was assaulted by Donald Trump at Jeffrey Epstein's sex party at age 13.
[00:54:39.203 --> 00:54:40.303]  Made it all up!
[00:54:40.967 --> 00:54:41.307]  Well, no.
[00:54:41.607 --> 00:54:43.949]  They've introduced these things four times.
[00:54:44.529 --> 00:54:53.595]  And it's always people, they admit that you'll get homeless people, the Democrats, they sign up and say, I was on the plane and this happened, it was all made up.
[00:54:53.875 --> 00:54:57.798]  So they've now dropped four different lawsuits because it turns out it's all made up.
[00:54:57.858 --> 00:54:59.299]  Well, this is the Saul Alinsky tactic.
[00:54:59.319 --> 00:55:02.321]  Meanwhile, Clinton actually hangs out with Epstein on the pedophile plane.
[00:55:02.441 --> 00:55:02.841]  Six times.
[00:55:02.861 --> 00:55:03.822]  Six times she went there.
[00:55:03.862 --> 00:55:05.843]  The other Bill Clinton went 20 times.
[00:55:06.344 --> 00:55:11.767]  But that's the thing is this is a Saul Alinsky tactic to turn around what you yourself are guilty of.
[00:55:11.787 --> 00:55:12.888]  Who is Hillary's mentor.
[00:55:13.208 --> 00:55:14.549]  Who pledged himself to Lucifer.
[00:55:14.689 --> 00:55:14.909]  Right.
[00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:20.393]  And I always found the folks that like openly got, you know, heavy metal tattoos or whatever aren't the devil worshippers.
[00:55:20.413 --> 00:55:21.634]  The ones that all claim they're good people.
[00:55:21.926 --> 00:55:22.566]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:22.606 --> 00:55:26.688]  The ones that are like, oh, we just wanted to pick up the little orphans in Haiti to help them.
[00:55:26.728 --> 00:55:29.350]  She's like, Donald Trump has been avoiding taxes.
[00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:32.291]  He's using this tax hole, this tax loophole.
[00:55:32.331 --> 00:55:33.672]  Turns out they wrote it.
[00:55:33.792 --> 00:55:34.112]  Yeah.
[00:55:34.192 --> 00:55:36.513]  In 1993, Bill Clinton wrote the loophole.
[00:55:36.553 --> 00:55:38.574]  Who bought them TVs, bitch?
[00:55:38.654 --> 00:55:39.235]  Tell me that!
[00:55:39.315 --> 00:55:40.535]  And why did they make that loophole?
[00:55:40.715 --> 00:55:42.876]  For their billionaire friends to do other stuff.
[00:55:43.337 --> 00:55:44.737]  And Donald Trump's not a stupid guy.
[00:55:44.777 --> 00:55:45.278]  He found it.
[00:55:45.318 --> 00:55:45.898]  He used it.
[00:55:46.078 --> 00:55:50.139]  There's a difference between, what is it, tax evasion and tax avoidance.
[00:55:50.179 --> 00:55:54.180]  But he says, I want to fix this and make the money come back.
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.981]  It's incredible.
[00:55:56.021 --> 00:55:57.141]  Alright, crew, awesome.
[00:55:57.521 --> 00:55:58.301]  Listeners, awesome.
[00:55:58.321 --> 00:55:58.781]  Spread the word.

[00:56:00.722 --> 00:56:02.002]  They've already got a big black eye.
[00:56:02.042 --> 00:56:03.482]  They're already crapping their pants.
[00:56:03.863 --> 00:56:04.723]  They're already everywhere.
[00:56:04.783 --> 00:56:09.384]  Even the Washington Post said, InfoWars is bigger than anything except drudge and we're so upset.
[00:56:09.764 --> 00:56:10.204]  Blue, blue, blue.
[00:56:10.425 --> 00:56:13.227]  Let's, not 10 million views, 100 million.
[00:56:13.568 --> 00:56:15.970]  Let's just, oh, oh, you're pathetic.
[00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:17.131]  Spread those links.
[00:56:17.471 --> 00:56:17.952]  It'll happen.
[00:56:17.972 --> 00:56:19.433]  We're going to add them all up on Wednesday.
[00:56:19.853 --> 00:56:21.715]  All the hundreds of videos and feeds.
[00:56:21.755 --> 00:56:26.279]  I mean, some of our feeds already have 5 million people on them, so we're already up to the 15 million point.
[00:56:27.148 --> 00:56:29.130]  Oh, look at this .50 caliber rifle.
[00:56:29.751 --> 00:56:31.233]  Is Jesse trying to make me drool?
[00:56:31.273 --> 00:56:32.214]  Is that a gift to me?
[00:56:32.414 --> 00:56:33.856]  Just bring it over here.
[00:56:33.876 --> 00:56:37.200]  I can't ever have enough guns.
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:39.222]  I can't go to Jesse's house.
[00:56:39.242 --> 00:56:40.564]  He uses his carved guns.
[00:56:40.884 --> 00:56:43.187]  I told him, I said, the next .45 you make, I'm getting.
[00:56:43.227 --> 00:56:45.029]  He's like, I'll let you, I'll let you.
[00:56:45.129 --> 00:56:45.991]  I'm sorry, those are all sold.
[00:56:46.671 --> 00:56:48.532]  Anyways, but hey, whatever.
[00:56:49.052 --> 00:56:50.852]  I'll even pay up, bitch, but he won't give it to me.
[00:56:51.152 --> 00:56:52.433]  So we got this right here.
[00:56:53.033 --> 00:56:53.653]  We got this.
[00:56:54.473 --> 00:56:56.614]  Michael Moore is a sack of garbage.
[00:56:56.894 --> 00:56:58.975]  This is a Paul Watson report bleeped heavily.
[00:56:59.375 --> 00:57:00.915]  We'll be back with Jesse James in the studio.
[00:57:00.935 --> 00:57:01.316]  Stay with us.
[00:57:02.056 --> 00:57:03.496]  Michael Moore is a sack of
[00:57:18.004 --> 00:57:21.286]  I just heard on the streets of Belfast here that you supported Hillary Clinton.
[00:57:27.529 --> 00:57:28.669]  She voted for the Iraq War.
[00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:32.091]  She's funded by Goldman Sachs.
[00:57:33.112 --> 00:57:33.812]  This is not good.
[00:57:34.032 --> 00:57:37.234]  Now we have Hillary Clinton and you to blame for this.
[00:57:39.509 --> 00:57:45.391]  You should be out there doing what you can do to get Hillary Clinton elected because every minute counts now.
[00:57:45.411 --> 00:57:46.952]  I mean, this is a pretty good person.
[00:57:47.312 --> 00:57:48.372]  She's a decent person.
[00:57:48.592 --> 00:57:56.935]  I believe that she has made incredible changes that the left should embrace and we should get out there and get excited about her.
[00:57:57.882 --> 00:57:58.343]  Wait a minute.
[00:57:58.363 --> 00:58:12.495]  You're telling me that Michael Moore, the guy who built his entire career on railing against Wall Street and corporate America, is now endorsing Hillary Clinton, the ultimate bought-and-paid-for corporate stooge Wall Street insider?
[00:58:12.555 --> 00:58:19.220]  The woman whose campaign has received over $58 million from big banks and Wall Street firms.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:22.183]  It took Michael Moore just four months to go from this...
[00:58:22.583 --> 00:58:25.844]  Now we have Hillary Clinton and you to blame for this.
[00:58:26.004 --> 00:58:26.704]  This is not good.
[00:58:26.765 --> 00:58:27.325]  To this!
[00:58:27.585 --> 00:58:29.045]  I mean, this is a pretty good person.
[00:58:29.385 --> 00:58:30.466]  She's a decent person.
[00:58:30.566 --> 00:58:32.326]  What happened to Michael Moore?
[00:58:32.367 --> 00:58:42.050]  Whether you love or loathe his politics, Michael Moore's entire shtick for the past 25 years has been to cultivate this champion of the average Joe image.
[00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:50.952]  Now he's endorsing someone who literally tells elitists in private speeches that it's important to have a public and a private policy.
[00:58:51.052 --> 00:58:55.213]  In other words, it's important to lie to the average Joe.
[00:58:55.353 --> 00:59:07.116]  Michael Moore's first film, Roger and Me, the one that made him famous is about how Flint, Michigan was devastated when all the jobs started being offshored thanks to globalist trade policies.
[00:59:07.196 --> 00:59:10.517]  Globalist trade policies that Hillary Clinton supported.
[00:59:10.757 --> 00:59:13.118]  That she continued to support with NAFTA.
[00:59:13.278 --> 00:59:15.958]  That she continued to support with TPP.
[00:59:16.078 --> 00:59:22.020]  Critics blame NAFTA for the loss of manufacturing jobs in industrial states including Ohio and Pennsylvania.
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:24.421]  Hillary Clinton helped get NAFTA approved.
[00:59:24.581 --> 00:59:28.722]  She held at least five meetings to strategize about how to win congressional approval.
[00:59:28.962 --> 00:59:32.843]  She helped the White House block opposition from labor and environmental groups.
[00:59:33.323 --> 00:59:35.524]  And she was the featured speaker at a crucial meeting.
[00:59:35.584 --> 00:59:40.225]  Participants in that event said, quote, her remarks were totally pro-NAFTA.
[00:59:40.405 --> 00:59:53.861]  So Michael Moore, the man who cut his teeth on standing up to doctrines of neoliberal globalization, is now endorsing the ultimate embodiment of neoliberal globalization, Hillary Clinton.
[00:59:53.941 --> 00:59:55.303]  But wait, that's not all.
[00:59:55.423 --> 00:59:58.046]  Michael Moore's next big film, Canadian Bacon,
[00:59:58.226 --> 01:00:02.412]  was a satirical denunciation of the ludicrousness of war.
[01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:05.135]  It's time to give war a chance.
[01:00:05.456 --> 01:00:08.380]  What are we going to do for an enemy now?
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:14.268]  Now he's endorsed a candidate who has ludicrously threatened to go to war with Russia.
[01:00:14.548 --> 01:00:22.273]  As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[01:00:22.833 --> 01:00:28.156]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[01:00:28.436 --> 01:00:29.237]  And I'm not done.
[01:00:29.357 --> 01:00:37.642]  In Michael Moore's best-selling book, Downsize This, he crucified Nike for outsourcing shoe production and killing American jobs.
[01:00:37.802 --> 01:00:45.924]  Now he's endorsing a candidate whose Clinton Foundation received as much as $1 million from, you guessed it, Nike.
[01:00:46.004 --> 01:00:50.585]  Nike also supports the TPP, which will outsource more American jobs.
[01:00:50.905 --> 01:00:54.265]  The very thing that Michael Moore supposedly opposes.
[01:00:54.345 --> 01:00:55.406]  And I'm still not done.
[01:00:55.566 --> 01:01:01.647]  In Fahrenheit 9-11, Moore chastised the Bosch family for their close ties to the Saudi government.
[01:01:01.727 --> 01:01:04.368]  The same Saudi government that gave $25 million
[01:01:06.388 --> 01:01:07.629]  To the Clinton Foundation!
[01:01:07.669 --> 01:01:08.910]  The Clinton Foundation!
[01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:10.791]  The clues in the name, Michael!
[01:01:11.091 --> 01:01:12.592]  That's your candidate!
[01:01:12.652 --> 01:01:19.516]  But don't worry, because Michael Moore has come up with an ingenious explanation to justify his bizarre flip-flop.
[01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:26.701]  Why should people support Hillary Clinton, especially people like you who feel like they represent the Clintons themselves, including Hillary Clinton?
[01:01:26.961 --> 01:01:30.603]  They represent corporate interests and not the working man and woman.
[01:01:32.224 --> 01:01:33.685]  Because I don't think that's where she's at now.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:35.621]  I think that she's gonna go in there.
[01:01:35.641 --> 01:01:38.203]  I mean, first of all, she's adopted two-thirds of Bernie's platform.
[01:01:39.184 --> 01:01:47.271]  I don't understand any Bernie supporter who's still angry about this when the candidate has adopted two-thirds of what he was pushing for.
[01:01:47.351 --> 01:01:47.992]  That's right!
[01:01:48.172 --> 01:01:55.138]  Hillary Clinton, who is deemed honest and trustworthy by just 11% of the U.S.
[01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:55.839]  population.
[01:01:55.899 --> 01:02:01.826]  The woman who says it's important to deceive people by having a public and a private policy.
[01:02:01.886 --> 01:02:07.773]  But you can totally trust her when she says she's going to adopt the populist planks of Bernie's platform.
[01:02:07.833 --> 01:02:08.754]  Give me a break!
[01:02:08.954 --> 01:02:14.120]  It would be bad enough if Moore was abandoning his principles for a lesser of two evils scenario.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.821]  But it's far worse.
[01:02:15.921 --> 01:02:24.005]  In his new film Trumpland, he's literally sitting in front of giant pictures of Hillary Clinton while calling her his forbidden love.
[01:02:24.125 --> 01:02:31.069]  He calls on the audience to stand up and perform emotional odes to Hillary, like they're worshipping Dear Leader.
[01:02:31.089 --> 01:02:33.811]  This wouldn't look out of place in North Korea.
[01:02:33.991 --> 01:02:38.776]  He also says Hillary is the new Pope Francis, literally deifying her.
[01:02:38.816 --> 01:02:50.828]  If we saw a North Korean comic do a routine that basically involved cajoling the audience to sing the praises of Kim Jong-un, we'd think, God, these poor people can't even chill at stand-up, writes Brendan O'Neill.
[01:02:51.368 --> 01:03:03.714]  Yet here we have one of America's best-known funny men turning a comedy show into a cultish-cum-therapeutic rally for the possible next commander-in-chief, and no one bats an eyelid.
[01:03:03.855 --> 01:03:07.757]  Here's another reason why Michael Moore is a sack of s***.
[01:03:07.877 --> 01:03:12.299]  You've probably seen that whole rant where he outlines why the middle class are supporting Trump.
[01:03:12.399 --> 01:03:15.501]  You know, that bit that Trump supporters turned into a campaign ad.
[01:03:15.521 --> 01:03:17.802]  Trump's election is going to be the biggest
[01:03:18.302 --> 01:03:19.563]  Well, this is what you didn't see.
[01:03:32.498 --> 01:03:36.823]  Only to find out that if you vote to leave Europe, you actually have to leave Europe.
[01:03:36.983 --> 01:03:38.005]  And now they regret it!
[01:03:38.225 --> 01:03:39.567]  Total bull****!
[01:03:40.227 --> 01:03:48.797]  Even after a massive, sustained propaganda campaign, the polls show that only 6% of Brexit voters regretted it.
[01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:49.678]  Only 6%.
[01:03:49.938 --> 01:03:56.340]  Theresa May, the new Prime Minister who has promised to take Britain out of the EU, is also incredibly popular.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.022]  Neither of those things are indicators of regret.
[01:04:00.202 --> 01:04:08.464]  They all voted to leave and now they regret it and over 4 million of them have signed a petition to have a do-over.
[01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:09.845]  They want another election.
[01:04:12.677 --> 01:04:23.086]  The people who signed a petition to have a do-over were the ones who voted to remain in the EU, not leave it, you utter f***ing moron!
[01:04:23.146 --> 01:04:32.554]  So he's trying to argue that the Brexit vote was a terrible decision and that all the people who voted for it are now regretting it, and then he's equating that to Trump supporters.
[01:04:32.694 --> 01:04:38.879]  Even though every single example he cites of Brexit regret is disproven bulls***!
[01:04:39.559 --> 01:04:41.361]  How many more people do I need to convince?
[01:04:42.261 --> 01:04:48.625]  Why is Michael Moore now endorsing everything that he spent his entire adult life opposing?
[01:04:48.805 --> 01:04:55.730]  Why is he cheerleading for a presidential candidate who embodies everything that he supposedly hates?
[01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:59.432]  Could it be because Michael Moore is a hypocritical sack of s***?
[01:05:00.336 --> 01:05:04.377]  Whose entire man-of-the-people persona is a complete fraud?
[01:05:04.537 --> 01:05:21.262]  Is it because Michael Moore is actually an out-of-touch, anti-capitalist, multi-millionaire member of the left-wing intelligentsia, whose entire fat putrid existence is wholly dependent on the very same establishment that he used to rage against?
[01:05:21.522 --> 01:05:22.122]  And it's a yes.
[01:05:22.262 --> 01:05:28.044]  Michael Moore is a duplicitous, corrupted, flip-flopping, elitist sack of s***!
[01:05:28.939 --> 01:05:35.845]  You supported Hillary Clinton?
[01:05:36.005 --> 01:05:43.592]  You should be out there doing what you can do to get Hillary Clinton elected.
[01:05:43.612 --> 01:05:49.777]  If the majority of the people had their say on Michael Boor, I think it would be, shut the f**k up.
[01:05:53.447 --> 01:05:55.188]  Alright folks, it's 9-12 Central.
[01:05:55.529 --> 01:05:59.051]  And we're like, I don't know, 13 hours in the worldwide broadcast.
[01:05:59.071 --> 01:06:00.813]  We're going right through tomorrow, right through the next day.
[01:06:01.373 --> 01:06:01.793]  You know me.
[01:06:01.953 --> 01:06:03.415]  I told you when Trump was behind.
[01:06:03.475 --> 01:06:04.335]  I told you when he was ahead.
[01:06:04.395 --> 01:06:05.736]  He is way ahead now.
[01:06:05.756 --> 01:06:07.578]  We've got Roger Stone on and others.
[01:06:07.618 --> 01:06:09.379]  He is dominating in every swing state.
[01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:13.242]  Hillary's having some midnight panic in a couple hours with Bruce Springsteen.
[01:06:13.722 --> 01:06:14.563]  They're in free fall.
[01:06:15.584 --> 01:06:16.384]  Will they try to steal it?
[01:06:16.404 --> 01:06:18.766]  Hey, whatever happens, I don't just say this, I mean it.
[01:06:19.166 --> 01:06:19.787]  We're winning.
[01:06:19.847 --> 01:06:20.988]  Americana is back.
[01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:22.965]  Let me tell you something.
[01:06:23.345 --> 01:06:26.549]  Trump's lost hundreds of millions in sponsorship, TV shows.
[01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:28.171]  He's gone through a lot.
[01:06:28.211 --> 01:06:29.132]  He's put so much on the line.
[01:06:29.192 --> 01:06:30.013]  He's the man in the arena.
[01:06:30.474 --> 01:06:32.496]  I'll tell you who else is the man in the arena.
[01:06:32.837 --> 01:06:33.457]  Jesse James.
[01:06:33.738 --> 01:06:35.059]  Known this guy like five, six years.
[01:06:35.079 --> 01:06:37.682]  We're not going to get into the details, but our kids are friends.
[01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:38.083]  Hang out.
[01:06:38.643 --> 01:06:39.945]  Daughter just stayed at your house last night.
[01:06:40.786 --> 01:06:41.947]  So much is going on.
[01:06:42.688 --> 01:06:45.371]  We're parents in this fight.
[01:06:45.511 --> 01:06:46.172]  All this is going on.
[01:06:46.192 --> 01:06:48.034]  We're just regular Americans.
[01:06:48.896 --> 01:06:51.098]  And we as parents just want a free country.
[01:06:51.759 --> 01:06:57.045]  And you're the first person, I remember when it happened, within minutes it was like, Jesse James endorses Donald Trump.
[01:06:57.105 --> 01:06:57.946]  I know you guys are friends.
[01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.329]  Congratulations on being on the right side of history.
[01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:01.691]  Thank you.
[01:07:03.243 --> 01:07:08.732]  I'm wound up as you can tell, but Jesse James, you know, behind the scenes you're a pretty wild guy, but you're also pretty calm on air.
[01:07:09.073 --> 01:07:10.055]  Where should we go with this?
[01:07:10.155 --> 01:07:11.397]  I mean, why'd you back Trump?
[01:07:11.677 --> 01:07:12.759]  Where do you see this going?
[01:07:12.859 --> 01:07:15.965]  Second Amendment, you're launching a national gun group with him?
[01:07:16.005 --> 01:07:16.445]  How awesome.
[01:07:17.318 --> 01:07:25.543]  Well, I think it, uh, I don't know when I sent him a note, I sent him a text when NBC cut him off when he decided to run for president.
[01:07:26.023 --> 01:07:31.187]  And he had, you know, hits a hit show, 15, 20 million people a week watching The Apprentice or Celebrity Apprentice.
[01:07:31.687 --> 01:07:36.270]  And, you know, it's lots of sponsorship, lots of in, you know, product placement, endorsement deals.
[01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:46.416]  And he basically told NBC, F you, you know, they, they're obviously, you know, as stuff transpired, you can see how twisted it is towards the left.
[01:07:47.174 --> 01:07:51.779]  And he, you know, and I told him, I said, Hey man, that was like an iron balls move to like do that.
[01:07:51.799 --> 01:07:52.780]  And you got my respect.
[01:07:53.541 --> 01:08:00.087]  And, um, you know, just started talking with him and, uh, I just felt compelled to no one.
[01:08:00.327 --> 01:08:01.689]  Everybody thought it was a joke.
[01:08:02.129 --> 01:08:03.891]  Everybody thought that he wasn't serious.
[01:08:03.931 --> 01:08:05.172]  It was like a publicity stunt.
[01:08:05.673 --> 01:08:06.213]  And when, uh,
[01:08:07.808 --> 01:08:19.074]  You know, I just wrote a piece of like my personal point of view, like not my opinion, not my, this is the person that I saw and is this person cut out to be a president?
[01:08:19.154 --> 01:08:25.818]  And it, you know, it was like 25 or 30, I don't even know how many it is now, but 20 or 35 million views on Facebook.
[01:08:29.182 --> 01:08:32.844]  And, uh, you know, Kainá was the first person to come out and endorse him.
[01:08:32.864 --> 01:08:34.605]  Hey, man, I have your back if you want to be president.
[01:08:34.866 --> 01:08:38.448]  He doesn't need, I think what a lot of people miss is he doesn't need to be president.
[01:08:39.288 --> 01:08:45.632]  And he sure as hell doesn't need to go through the crazy amount of BS that he's had to go through.
[01:08:45.712 --> 01:08:54.458]  And you figure if anybody's going to walk through fire like that, and like he has been put under the microscope, that he must really, really love America and love this country.
[01:08:55.677 --> 01:08:57.778]  Well, I took your endorsement, because I know you're a real guy.
[01:08:57.838 --> 01:09:00.720]  People see TV, you're one of the top TV hosts of all time.
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:03.282]  Probably one of the top, not Donald Trump.
[01:09:03.922 --> 01:09:06.063]  And you're a real guy, I'm not kissing your ass, it's true.
[01:09:07.024 --> 01:09:11.747]  And you haven't done reality TV in a long time, because as you pointed out to me, so much of it's garbage, it's fake.
[01:09:12.607 --> 01:09:16.089]  And here you are, we were talking like a year and a half ago, you know, no, Trump's for real.
[01:09:16.129 --> 01:09:18.390]  And I talked to other folks, they said, no, Trump's for real.
[01:09:18.791 --> 01:09:23.994]  And now you've seen it, what he's gone through, what he's done, what he's done for us, our families,
[01:09:24.714 --> 01:09:31.439]  Pointing out how we've been screwed over by special interests that have sold out the American dream because America was dominating the world.
[01:09:31.979 --> 01:09:33.040]  And so here we are.
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.582]  He's gone through all this and now he bucked the system.
[01:09:36.642 --> 01:09:41.966]  He defeated the Republicans and the establishment saying he couldn't win the nomination or that they would take it away.
[01:09:42.206 --> 01:09:42.827]  They failed.
[01:09:43.167 --> 01:09:48.511]  And now here he is in every poll now, even fixed polls, surging past Hillary Clinton
[01:09:49.031 --> 01:09:51.974]  This is like beyond some football movie or something.
[01:09:51.994 --> 01:09:53.877]  This is beyond some Disney movie.
[01:09:53.937 --> 01:09:55.899]  I'm like pinching myself, Jesse James.
[01:09:55.959 --> 01:09:56.459]  Is this real?
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:10:02.246]  It's like swimming up the, you know, the world's biggest stream because everybody's against him.
[01:10:02.286 --> 01:10:02.987]  But you know what?
[01:10:03.027 --> 01:10:05.650]  There's one key factor that don't
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:09.783]  That people don't, all these people that, oh she's gonna win, it's gonna be easy.
[01:10:09.823 --> 01:10:14.928]  They don't figure that there's like hard-working American people that want something better for the future.
[01:10:15.468 --> 01:10:20.272]  They don't read tabloids and they don't care if Jay-Z plays on stage.
[01:10:20.312 --> 01:10:21.494]  They don't care about all that stuff.
[01:10:21.534 --> 01:10:28.580]  They want someone that like comes to their town, looks them in the eye and tells them like, hey man, I'm gonna bust my ass to do something better for you.
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:30.982]  I only bring this up because it's totally organic.
[01:10:31.503 --> 01:10:33.465]  You know, my daughter, your daughter, good friends.
[01:10:34.086 --> 01:10:34.666]  It's crazy.
[01:10:34.767 --> 01:10:36.609]  I'm not pushing Trump paraphernalia on them.
[01:10:37.089 --> 01:10:39.111]  I'm not saying do this or that political.
[01:10:39.231 --> 01:10:41.514]  And they're big fans of Trump for like over a year.
[01:10:42.014 --> 01:10:42.795]  And that's what I'm saying.
[01:10:43.936 --> 01:10:45.618]  Their other friends are Trump fans.
[01:10:46.119 --> 01:10:47.400]  That's got to scare the system.
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:48.922]  I talked to people with other kids at other schools.
[01:10:48.942 --> 01:10:49.322]  They go, no.
[01:10:50.023 --> 01:10:53.005]  You know, we're talking 12, 13 year old girls, kids, boys, 14.
[01:10:53.346 --> 01:11:12.580]  We were at dinner tonight talking about they have, like Hillary has some Snapchat filter app and she was talking about how her and her friends at school, you know, were doing the Snapchat filter but acting like they're vomiting when they had, like, Hillary's like, blah, Hillary, I'm with her.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.561]  That's all over the web, yeah.
[01:11:13.701 --> 01:11:14.542]  Yeah, and it's funny.
[01:11:14.562 --> 01:11:15.182]  So what does that say if
[01:11:16.798 --> 01:11:18.880]  If we pushed our kids to be for something, they wouldn't do it.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.361]  I never told them anything about Trump.
[01:11:20.381 --> 01:11:21.141]  I try to shield them.
[01:11:21.342 --> 01:11:22.322]  They're all Trump, Trump, Trump.
[01:11:22.382 --> 01:11:23.623]  I mean, I know your daughter.
[01:11:23.683 --> 01:11:24.364]  So what does that say?
[01:11:25.144 --> 01:11:30.088]  Well, kids are a lot smarter than, you know, I didn't know anything about politics when I was growing up.
[01:11:30.148 --> 01:11:32.970]  You know, my grandpa, like, okay, we're Republicans.
[01:11:33.391 --> 01:11:36.713]  And then my grandpa always watched nightly news and then read the paper.
[01:11:36.773 --> 01:11:38.134]  And that's how you got information.
[01:11:38.194 --> 01:11:39.636]  I think kids like have
[01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:44.981]  The world's biggest encyclopedia now in all their pockets, so they want to know something they can find out.
[01:11:45.001 --> 01:11:45.922]  Those damn phones, yeah.
[01:11:45.982 --> 01:11:46.823]  Yeah, and it's crazy.
[01:11:46.843 --> 01:11:49.045]  But there's something positive about it because... Yeah, I think so.
[01:11:49.065 --> 01:11:53.870]  They're well-informed and they're not gonna just do what everybody tells them or spoon-feeds them, you know?
[01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:55.012]  Well, I don't want to build us up.
[01:11:55.052 --> 01:11:56.333]  I have to be honest with you, though.
[01:11:56.353 --> 01:12:00.297]  I have to say this first and foremost.
[01:12:01.318 --> 01:12:01.759]  You know what?
[01:12:02.894 --> 01:12:03.614]  Because we're friends.
[01:12:03.674 --> 01:12:09.335]  I'm friends with Dan Winters, you know, I'm the godfather of his son and like he had sent me videos.
[01:12:09.355 --> 01:12:10.716]  This is before I moved here full-time.
[01:12:10.796 --> 01:12:12.196]  Oh, you got to check out this guy, Alex.
[01:12:12.536 --> 01:12:13.636]  I thought you're pretty crazy.
[01:12:15.137 --> 01:12:20.258]  Like, like, you know, banks are poisoning our water and blah blah blah and all this stuff and I was like, wow, this guy's a nut.
[01:12:20.718 --> 01:12:29.740]  And then I found out we live pretty close to each other and then our kids hung out and stuff and then this whole year has been like, wow.
[01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:32.456]  Alex is right on a lot of stuff.
[01:12:32.496 --> 01:12:33.437]  Well, you're nice to say that.
[01:12:33.497 --> 01:12:34.118]  Listen, listen.
[01:12:34.158 --> 01:12:34.859]  Thank you, brother.
[01:12:34.879 --> 01:12:35.459]  There you go.
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:37.582]  Dan Winters, the top photographer in the world.
[01:12:37.742 --> 01:12:38.924]  Yeah.
[01:12:39.324 --> 01:12:40.005]  He loves you.
[01:12:40.045 --> 01:12:42.748]  I remember years ago, he was taking some photos for some magazines.
[01:12:43.069 --> 01:12:44.491]  Listen, I wish I was wrong.
[01:12:44.551 --> 01:12:46.373]  The problem is I've read the crap that
[01:12:46.693 --> 01:12:47.454]  I do this all day.
[01:13:18.474 --> 01:13:19.815]  You sent me the address.
[01:13:20.035 --> 01:13:20.615]  I sent the address.
[01:13:20.915 --> 01:13:24.197]  I want, you send me, tempting me, these guns.
[01:13:24.777 --> 01:13:26.738]  And then every time I try to buy one, I'm like, oh sorry, it's sold.
[01:13:27.078 --> 01:13:30.600]  And I've learned from people, and I've been to your house several times, I've seen it.
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:35.562]  You are literally like Thestis or Vulcan in these spacesuits.
[01:13:35.962 --> 01:13:42.668]  With fire, I'm like 50 feet away, and there's these huge machines, I can't even go in there, and you're making all this stuff, there's no one there!
[01:13:43.149 --> 01:13:45.011]  Jesse James Firearms is you!
[01:13:45.391 --> 01:13:47.173]  And there's a assembly line of weapons!
[01:13:47.493 --> 01:13:48.094]  No, no, no!
[01:13:48.134 --> 01:13:50.336]  Well, there's some people, but how are you?
[01:13:50.496 --> 01:13:53.138]  Let me tell you, that's super, that's so manly.
[01:13:53.158 --> 01:13:58.443]  I remember thinking my grandpas could like fix combines and do anything, and I'm like, you can't do electricity work, my dad.
[01:13:58.744 --> 01:13:59.484]  So how do you do it?
[01:13:59.704 --> 01:14:00.185]  How do you do it?
[01:14:00.325 --> 01:14:01.486]  I made this one right here.
[01:14:01.586 --> 01:14:04.327]  Well, listen, the ones you sent me with the little leaves and everything.
[01:14:04.447 --> 01:14:05.188]  I forged that one.
[01:14:05.468 --> 01:14:05.888]  Oh my God.
[01:14:06.168 --> 01:14:07.689]  Can I just please buy the next gun?
[01:14:08.429 --> 01:14:09.670]  Look at this .45, 9-11.
[01:14:09.930 --> 01:14:10.851]  It's all Damascus.
[01:14:10.931 --> 01:14:11.731]  I forged all that.
[01:14:11.771 --> 01:14:13.972]  It's 1,026 layers on the side.
[01:14:13.992 --> 01:14:18.015]  No, this is beautiful, but that one you sent me with the leaves and all the intricate work.
[01:14:19.548 --> 01:14:20.008]  I don't know.
[01:14:35.453 --> 01:14:38.294]  It's like a frickin' fire shooting out here in a space suit.
[01:14:38.494 --> 01:14:45.097]  I think once you reach a certain level of fame, people think that I'm like in my office with a top hat and a monocle and like, oh.
[01:14:45.117 --> 01:14:47.018]  You told me, you said, I don't even go in the house.
[01:14:47.478 --> 01:14:47.998]  I don't.
[01:14:48.698 --> 01:14:50.219]  All these fat Prince Bulldogs.
[01:14:50.279 --> 01:14:57.542]  Yeah, the shop restroom was busted for about two weeks and I had to walk in the house to like piss and it like, this is the worst.
[01:14:57.822 --> 01:14:59.244]  I never even leave the property though.
[01:14:59.264 --> 01:14:59.985]  I'm like a hermit.
[01:15:00.466 --> 01:15:01.287]  I just like to work.
[01:15:01.387 --> 01:15:02.589]  That's a beautiful place out there.
[01:15:02.629 --> 01:15:07.916]  Now, Jesse, looking at Trump and all of this, listen, I never liked the Democrats.
[01:15:08.436 --> 01:15:11.440]  The Republicans don't deliver on what they say they're doing, but I agree with their platform more.
[01:15:11.761 --> 01:15:12.402]  But with Trump,
[01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:21.621]  I mean I've gone from like grudgingly supporting him a year and a half ago to like so proud that I supported this guy.
[01:15:21.641 --> 01:15:26.284]  The stamina, the work, the attacks, the demon.
[01:15:26.444 --> 01:15:29.586]  It'll be the best vetted president we've ever had ever and I think
[01:15:30.490 --> 01:15:38.418]  Uh, everybody was ready for a change when, not the Obama change, but when Obama ran the first time, I bought into it a little bit.
[01:15:38.498 --> 01:15:40.961]  I was like, well, hey man, it'd be cool to have Obama.
[01:15:41.041 --> 01:15:44.184]  I'll be honest, I was neutral because I was sick of Republicans.
[01:15:44.404 --> 01:15:46.646]  It'll be cool to have, I grew up in the hood, man.
[01:15:46.666 --> 01:15:51.311]  I was born in Linwood and grew up in Southgate and Long Beach and I was like, man, it'd be cool to have a brother as president.
[01:15:51.351 --> 01:15:52.252]  You know, that's what we need.
[01:15:52.492 --> 01:15:53.073]  I wasn't kidding!
[01:16:11.616 --> 01:16:17.919]  Well, exactly, not knocking teachers, because there is a rare case where somebody goes and teaches, but teachers teach because they can't do it.
[01:16:18.259 --> 01:16:18.519]  Yeah.
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:22.441]  Every college professor, when I was in college, they're all disgruntled.
[01:16:22.481 --> 01:16:26.603]  They all feel like everything's stacked against them, and they're all like, I don't know.
[01:16:26.964 --> 01:16:30.045]  I'm so disappointed, because that guy could have been so great.
[01:16:32.246 --> 01:16:38.028]  Single-handedly, with like a few words, he could end all division in this country.
[01:16:38.088 --> 01:16:39.548]  He could end all racism.
[01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:47.211]  He could lift up homeless people and all that stuff, but... No, that's why I tacitly... What it's really all about, it's all about himself.
[01:16:47.311 --> 01:16:50.272]  It's all about, you know, where's he gonna land soft at?
[01:16:50.312 --> 01:16:52.132]  What kind of a badass house is he gonna have?
[01:16:52.172 --> 01:16:53.113]  That's what it's all about.
[01:16:53.173 --> 01:16:56.874]  I was about to say, we thought Bush was bad at vacationing two months a year.
[01:16:57.234 --> 01:16:58.754]  Three, four, five months a year?
[01:16:58.774 --> 01:17:00.235]  You can tell a lot about people
[01:17:01.175 --> 01:17:06.180]  I know Bush's Secret Service guys, and that guy's the greatest guy ever.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:15.448]  I know some of the couple of Secret Service guys we did guns that are with Trump now, and he's, you know, that guy's like down to earth, you know?
[01:17:15.488 --> 01:17:17.310]  He's hanging out with the White Staff.
[01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:26.358]  I know a guy that's with Hillary, and I know one guy that's with Michelle, and a former guy with Obama, and all three of them treat them like dirt.
[01:17:26.858 --> 01:17:28.199]  Well, Hillary doesn't let you look at the guy.
[01:17:28.279 --> 01:17:33.221]  I think I'm a firm believer that you can tell a lot about a person is how they treat the little guy.
[01:17:33.681 --> 01:17:35.942]  And when they treat him like that, you know what that means?
[01:17:36.282 --> 01:17:38.223]  It means they're in a position they didn't earn.
[01:17:38.863 --> 01:17:45.586]  You know, Trump, man, that guy's had ups and downs, everything else, but he earned where he's at, and he has to bust his ass to stay there.
[01:17:45.846 --> 01:17:48.787]  And his dad was literally blue collar, came from nothing.
[01:17:48.848 --> 01:17:49.868]  That's the secret of Trump.
[01:17:50.028 --> 01:17:52.089]  Yeah, you know, and I just, I don't know.
[01:17:54.910 --> 01:18:11.262]  I think, myself, you, everybody, with all the information that we can get now, and especially like Wikileaks and all that stuff, is you feel, it makes you feel helpless, because you just want to go over and like, like John, you just want to grab John Podesta and shake him, you know?
[01:18:11.322 --> 01:18:14.304]  I agree with you, because I'm not a guy calling for violence, but I'm always honest.
[01:18:14.324 --> 01:18:15.565]  No, but we can't do anything.
[01:18:15.585 --> 01:18:19.107]  I actually start having like, fantasies, because...
[01:18:23.797 --> 01:18:24.658]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:18:24.998 --> 01:18:25.278]  Okay.
[01:18:25.498 --> 01:18:27.220]  I don't sit here and say what I want to believe.
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.120]  I say what's happening.
[01:18:28.161 --> 01:18:29.642]  I've talked to the top pollsters, seen the numbers.
[01:18:29.882 --> 01:18:30.622]  Trump's surging.
[01:18:30.923 --> 01:18:32.884]  He clearly is winning the battleground states.
[01:18:33.365 --> 01:18:36.387]  What do we do tomorrow night when CNN says she won?
[01:18:36.407 --> 01:18:37.468]  I mean, what do I do?
[01:18:37.788 --> 01:18:40.450]  I'm not going to be violent, but I'm not going to stop promoting liberty.
[01:18:41.191 --> 01:18:43.133]  Well, you know, I don't know.
[01:18:43.473 --> 01:18:44.534]  You know, I think people
[01:18:45.393 --> 01:19:06.399]  We need to figure out a way to rise up and band together and, you know, if we can't vote someone out of office that is ineffective and keep someone out of office that's an obvious thief and stealing from us, you know, I just look at like all the money that Hillary's taken in the foundation, you know, imagine the dent she could have made in the homeless situation in America.
[01:19:06.419 --> 01:19:08.979]  How she stole 94% of the Haitian money?
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:12.740]  Yeah, you know, come on, like... Who comes up with this?
[01:19:13.341 --> 01:19:14.341]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:19:15.569 --> 01:19:24.600]  Looking at this, let's talk about Donald Trump, because you've told me stuff about Trump, nothing secret or private, but just how real he was back when I was first, a year and a half ago, supporting him.
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:28.124]  We were over at your house shooting with Shane Steiner and watching you smith some guns.
[01:19:29.195 --> 01:19:32.359]  But then I talked to Jerome Corsi, who was high level in the State Department.
[01:19:32.399 --> 01:19:33.140]  Other people, they say, no.
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.843]  Trump knew what you knew, Alex, 30 years ago.
[01:19:35.903 --> 01:19:37.224]  He just been waiting for the right moment.
[01:19:37.404 --> 01:19:38.866]  Yeah, it's all timing.
[01:19:38.886 --> 01:19:40.007]  You know, he's ahead of his time.
[01:19:40.027 --> 01:19:45.093]  You know, you can hear bits and pieces of his messages and old, you know.
[01:19:46.494 --> 01:19:57.263]  Stuff with interviews with Oprah and stuff like that, you know, he's never wavered and he's, I don't know, I'm like an entrepreneur of humans and I have the best BS detector ever.
[01:19:57.403 --> 01:19:59.384]  That's right, he was always against NFT.
[01:19:59.704 --> 01:20:02.347]  Yeah, and I can meet someone and like
[01:20:03.147 --> 01:20:04.968]  No, whether they're full of shit or not.
[01:20:05.128 --> 01:20:07.350]  And like him, I don't get that.
[01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:08.250]  And look at his kids.
[01:20:08.290 --> 01:20:09.111]  His kids are rad.
[01:20:09.151 --> 01:20:09.831]  Don Jr.
[01:20:09.851 --> 01:20:11.092]  and Ivanka.
[01:20:11.372 --> 01:20:12.993]  And they're part of the deal.
[01:20:13.033 --> 01:20:15.234]  We're going to have them in on it.
[01:20:15.834 --> 01:20:18.596]  It's like we're getting a group of superheroes.
[01:20:18.976 --> 01:20:20.277]  Treat this like a job interview.
[01:20:20.337 --> 01:20:23.819]  So I have a big business that has thousands of employees.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.060]  And who am I going to hire?
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:28.202]  I have two prospective clients.
[01:20:29.028 --> 01:20:33.439]  You know, take personality and politics aside, let's just go on job.
[01:20:34.335 --> 01:20:38.997]  You know, requirements and what their actual qualifications are.
[01:20:39.157 --> 01:20:40.578]  Trump's gonna win by a mile.
[01:20:40.678 --> 01:20:43.939]  Hillary's taken naps all day and sold out the communist Chinese.
[01:20:44.419 --> 01:20:46.140]  That's the thing, he's so presidential.
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:50.421]  Does anybody... No one's ever done eight campaign stops a day, or five on average.
[01:20:50.822 --> 01:20:52.402]  No one's ever had the stamina.
[01:20:53.843 --> 01:20:58.785]  I posted something after I voted last week and I had a UAW shirt on from the old
[01:20:59.785 --> 01:21:02.647]  Mountain Road plant that made, like, I think they made Chrysler engines.
[01:21:03.267 --> 01:21:08.430]  And then someone posted something about, like, oh, Mike Pence, you know, he's a union buster and stuff like that.
[01:21:08.490 --> 01:21:17.014]  I'm like, don't you think unlimited immigration and letting people flood in the country isn't that kind of a union buster?
[01:21:17.034 --> 01:21:19.476]  Yeah, why do the unions?
[01:21:19.516 --> 01:21:20.496]  Nothing against people coming in.
[01:21:20.516 --> 01:21:21.177]  I get why they're doing it.
[01:21:21.757 --> 01:21:23.978]  Why do we have to pay for everybody and then have Obama?
[01:21:24.018 --> 01:21:27.540]  Did you see him with the interviewer saying, I'm illegal, I'm gonna vote?
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:28.721]  He goes, well, that's your right to do.
[01:21:29.878 --> 01:21:34.901]  Yeah, I just think, you know, hey... It doesn't mean we hate anybody, but can we go to China or Mexico and vote?
[01:21:35.081 --> 01:21:42.706]  Look, honestly, like, I've ran a business for 25 years, and I had a couple hundred employees in California, and a good portion of those people were without papers.
[01:21:43.146 --> 01:21:46.128]  And I could take them right down to the spot where I knew the guy.
[01:21:46.288 --> 01:21:49.651]  I could get a real green card for each of them for $600.
[01:21:50.951 --> 01:21:54.113]  And get a real Social Security card with the hologram for $2,000.
[01:21:55.609 --> 01:22:06.472]  But, in retrospect, thinking about that now, like the guys, like Alex that you met at the shop, he's from Honduras and he's like, got a lawyer, he's already in the citizenship process.
[01:22:06.572 --> 01:22:06.952]  Agreed.
[01:22:06.972 --> 01:22:08.193]  Make the legal process easier.
[01:22:08.353 --> 01:22:09.853]  And he pays taxes.
[01:22:10.213 --> 01:22:15.795]  Because, you know what, we are America and we do let people... Well, the Democrats want to keep it underground so they control it.
[01:22:15.815 --> 01:22:19.896]  No, but here's the thing, like, we can let millions of people in there.
[01:22:20.496 --> 01:22:25.999]  But every one of those millions of people should stand side by side with us on tax day and pay their fair share.
[01:22:26.359 --> 01:22:44.908]  And I think a lot of the people, you know, I watched every Friday on payday at West Coast Choppers in Long Beach, I'd sign all their paychecks and there was a mobile check cashing truck used to pull up and they'd all cash their checks, not take any taxes out and send most of the money back to Mexico.
[01:22:44.948 --> 01:22:45.769]  And I'll say this right now.
[01:22:47.321 --> 01:22:50.502]  You do have to pledge allegiance if you want to be in this.
[01:22:50.542 --> 01:22:51.562]  I don't care what color you are.
[01:22:51.582 --> 01:22:55.564]  You're going to be pro-private property, pro-family, pro-gun.
[01:22:56.264 --> 01:22:59.625]  We're going to make you wealthy, but you've got to sign on and not be a socialist.
[01:22:59.885 --> 01:23:08.308]  Well, it's about us, not me, because me running my business like that and saving money on labor, I was only thinking about myself.
[01:23:08.428 --> 01:23:15.190]  I wasn't thinking about the betterment of the country, because there is guys that have all legal employees, and they're all paying taxes.
[01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:16.191]  Sure, but you're being honest.
[01:23:16.251 --> 01:23:17.232]  It was part of your process.
[01:23:17.332 --> 01:23:18.553]  Yeah, it was part of the process.
[01:23:18.613 --> 01:23:19.834]  I mean, it's like I paid for abortions.
[01:23:19.894 --> 01:23:21.055]  In retrospect, it doesn't appeal.
[01:23:21.075 --> 01:23:22.115]  I paid for abortions when I was 18.
[01:23:22.456 --> 01:23:23.076]  Now I'm against it.
[01:23:23.096 --> 01:23:24.817]  And it doesn't mean I'm a sub-democrat.
[01:23:24.837 --> 01:23:25.658]  I'm just being honest about it.
[01:23:25.678 --> 01:23:27.219]  Yeah, but I think... You grow.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.282]  Yeah, yeah, and you learn, like, hey, you know, that's not...
[01:23:30.822 --> 01:23:36.425]  You know, when the price for American-made goods goes through the roof and everything goes to China, that's why.
[01:23:36.485 --> 01:23:46.090]  Because not only was I finding cheaper labor, but people are already taking it another step and like, okay, let's ship all this stuff over to China and make it over there or make it in Pakistan or South America.
[01:23:46.110 --> 01:23:46.610]  Well, it's worse.
[01:23:46.650 --> 01:23:47.850]  You read the Globalist documents.
[01:23:50.427 --> 01:23:55.670]  Well, I think all these issues, I think, with the people that support Hillary have strong
[01:24:12.344 --> 01:24:13.524]  That's profound.
[01:24:13.825 --> 01:24:17.846]  I'm going to interrupt you.
[01:24:17.866 --> 01:24:19.307]  Jesse James right now here with us.
[01:24:20.067 --> 01:24:21.547]  They've got studies out of Canada.
[01:24:21.567 --> 01:24:22.128]  We can pull them up.
[01:24:22.168 --> 01:24:23.748]  Studies out of the UK and the US.
[01:24:23.808 --> 01:24:24.669]  Actually one out of Texas.
[01:24:24.929 --> 01:24:27.990]  I don't mean this mean, but people calling themselves liberal
[01:24:29.016 --> 01:24:48.590]  Are six times more likely to steal, ten times more likely not to give to charity, and are just these self-centered people that social justice warrior moral signal all day long, but they're actually, and then conservatives, not that term, are way more likely to give.
[01:24:48.610 --> 01:24:49.510]  So you just hit the nail on the head.
[01:24:49.731 --> 01:24:51.132]  From your experience, flesh that out.
[01:24:51.992 --> 01:24:52.692]  What are you getting at?
[01:24:52.712 --> 01:24:54.193]  Because to me, that's the essence.
[01:24:54.613 --> 01:24:54.993]  I don't know.
[01:24:55.053 --> 01:24:56.554]  I think I was born in the wrong generation.
[01:24:56.574 --> 01:25:02.496]  You know, I got a lot of the Reagan generation coming off the Iran crisis and the hostage crisis.
[01:25:02.576 --> 01:25:07.578]  And I saw, you know, even as a kid, like 10 years old, I was like, man, Carter's weak.
[01:25:07.898 --> 01:25:10.018]  You know, he's not he's not strong.
[01:25:10.058 --> 01:25:12.179]  And I think I've said it for years.
[01:25:12.219 --> 01:25:13.740]  You know, we need someone that's
[01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:19.064]  You know, I don't know how much control a president will have fighting against Congress.
[01:25:19.104 --> 01:25:25.130]  You know, it's always going to be a push and pull, but at least they need to be a president.
[01:25:25.570 --> 01:25:31.216]  They need to, like, rally people and rally people together and realize, like, you know, it's united we stand.
[01:25:31.396 --> 01:25:31.816]  And if you
[01:25:32.975 --> 01:25:42.078]  If everybody's only thinking about themselves and it's a personality conflict and stuff like that, I don't care if the person elected president, you know, looks like Godzilla.
[01:25:42.638 --> 01:25:56.022]  As long as he's in there doing the job and supports people and lifts us all up and knows, you know, hey, when Trump wins tomorrow, I'm not going to have any regrets against anybody that voted for Hillary or have any ill will towards them.
[01:25:56.042 --> 01:25:56.443]  You know what?
[01:25:56.483 --> 01:25:57.583]  Because we're all Americans.
[01:25:58.123 --> 01:25:59.864]  They don't get a nation is like a ship.
[01:25:59.884 --> 01:26:00.964]  I mean, we're on the same team.
[01:26:01.124 --> 01:26:04.326]  Yeah, and it's like we all have to band together.
[01:26:05.567 --> 01:26:09.509]  I opened a homeless shelter in Long Beach in 2004.
[01:26:11.170 --> 01:26:16.653]  And my big building there, I donated and it's the Long Beach Rescue Mission.
[01:26:16.974 --> 01:26:27.280]  But I went against the grain when Long Beach, all the other businesses in the business corridor downtown wrote me these nasty letters saying we should bust the homeless out of Long Beach and stuff like that.
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.080]  I'm like, you know what?
[01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:30.242]  No, I bought a building and opened it.
[01:26:31.286 --> 01:26:38.877]  I made it so you had to be employable to stay the night there and get food and get clothes and support.
[01:26:39.218 --> 01:26:41.261]  You set a bar to make them better.
[01:26:41.341 --> 01:26:46.268]  By being employable means you have to be willing to work and dig yourself out of it.
[01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:55.767]  And we help them find jobs, and I think when I moved in 2010, between 2004 and 2010, we found like, it was like 3,000 people we placed in permanent housing.
[01:26:55.908 --> 01:26:58.910]  And it's crazy, you're moving to the next door to Alex Jones, you can't make this stuff up.
[01:26:58.970 --> 01:27:01.793]  Jesse James is our guest, JJFU.com.
[01:27:02.133 --> 01:27:03.814]  You're not here to promote stuff, I'm gonna make you do it.
[01:27:03.854 --> 01:27:04.935]  What is this badass gun?
[01:27:05.436 --> 01:27:07.317]  And I'm not just saying this, you make your own stuff.
[01:27:07.337 --> 01:27:11.340]  I don't know how you do it, you've got a few folks that help you, but these are original crafted firearms.
[01:27:11.801 --> 01:27:14.043]  Tell us about this beautiful weapon we're looking at here.
[01:27:14.623 --> 01:27:32.001]  Um, well the Damascus Pistol is one that I forged that you saw me doing a little bit of, and this is a 300 Win Mag-like Precision Bolt Action Rifle, and we import a barrel in action from England, from RPA in England, and in every other piece except for the optic we make in-house.
[01:27:32.902 --> 01:27:43.589]  And, you know, just... Now, I know you've got a few little factories and stuff, and you also still do your shop, where you use some cars and motorcycles, but when I'm over at your place, I mean, it's like, there's like one guy helping you.
[01:27:43.609 --> 01:27:50.194]  You're in there, literally, like out of a movie, with like huge furnaces and blasting fire in a space suit, and like churning this stuff.
[01:27:50.274 --> 01:27:50.974]  How do you do that?
[01:27:50.994 --> 01:27:52.335]  You're like etching stuff yourself?
[01:27:52.635 --> 01:27:54.377]  And I'm told this is like 18 hours a day.
[01:27:54.417 --> 01:27:55.177]  I guess it's a love.
[01:27:56.178 --> 01:27:58.920]  Well, I think the business in California got so big that
[01:27:59.656 --> 01:28:03.601]  You know, with hundreds of employees and stuff, I didn't work anymore, and I was miserable.
[01:28:04.342 --> 01:28:08.969]  And now, I've eliminated everything from my life that would stop me from working.
[01:28:09.009 --> 01:28:11.072]  Like, there's no phone in the shop, no TV.
[01:28:11.112 --> 01:28:14.777]  So it's clear to say, because I've been there, and you're almost like, like, oh, I'm gonna do this, like, sure.
[01:28:15.077 --> 01:28:16.219]  I mean, you're like, you love this.
[01:28:16.519 --> 01:28:16.980]  I love it.
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:24.527]  Like I worked, I forged Saturday all day making some Damascus chef knives and some billets.
[01:28:24.647 --> 01:28:27.029]  I'm doing some guns out of Statue of Liberty material.
[01:28:27.490 --> 01:28:31.033]  And so I was working on it literally till like my ankles said, F you.
[01:28:31.073 --> 01:28:31.814]  And I like
[01:28:32.334 --> 01:28:34.956]  I barely made it from the shop to the house and then just laid down.
[01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:43.903]  I was about to say though, I don't just say this, I mean that is, there's something super manly about watching my grandfather's fix combines and they knew how to do electricity or they knew how to fix over there, I don't know any of that.
[01:28:44.203 --> 01:28:48.487]  Watching you in there, it's just like, like weapons and badass stuff's coming out.
[01:28:48.527 --> 01:28:50.528]  I'm like, this is humanity, you know?
[01:28:50.888 --> 01:28:54.111]  Like, like you were talking about wanting to teach people how to do that, was we've lost that.
[01:28:54.171 --> 01:28:56.092]  My dad knows how to fix anything compared to me.
[01:28:56.473 --> 01:28:57.894]  He was, his dad was better than him.
[01:28:58.194 --> 01:29:05.036]  Well, I think we became, we used to be a do-it-yourself society, and now we became like a do-it-for-me society, you know?
[01:29:05.316 --> 01:29:10.278]  And everything's thrown away, like when this pen, when that pen runs out, you just throw it out.
[01:29:10.338 --> 01:29:12.398]  Well, pens used to have cartridges in them.
[01:29:12.518 --> 01:29:13.279]  They're beautiful, yeah.
[01:29:13.499 --> 01:29:17.380]  So when you, when the pen went out, you just put a new one in it, you know?
[01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:19.661]  And it's kind of like... It's kind of like, throw your family away!
[01:29:19.681 --> 01:29:20.841]  Throw America away!
[01:29:21.201 --> 01:29:28.348]  Well, I think it's like disposable, you know, put it in a landfill and like, you know, I think every, I don't know, I think I was born in the wrong era.
[01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:30.130]  You know, I would have been better in the 40s.
[01:29:30.170 --> 01:29:33.033]  What is that really cool big green machine you've got?
[01:29:33.253 --> 01:29:34.635]  It's like a big robot.
[01:29:34.755 --> 01:29:39.439]  It's a 1921 Watson Stillman 350 ton forging press.
[01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:41.281]  It says gargantua on it.
[01:29:41.301 --> 01:29:41.461]  350 ton.
[01:29:41.481 --> 01:29:41.561]  Yeah.
[01:29:41.581 --> 01:29:41.621]  So.
[01:29:47.409 --> 01:29:55.452]  And then I have like a 70's Chambersburg forging hammer with a thousand pound head on it that's the machine weighs.
[01:29:55.872 --> 01:29:57.712]  And what's that big space suit thing?
[01:29:58.212 --> 01:30:11.937]  Like you wear those like an arm and like you're in there and like the fire's shooting out and like... Well, it's because I, when I'm standing in front of the forge, but actually I'm dumb because I just built a shield for the front of the forge and I kind of hide behind it now and turn it when it's in there.
[01:30:12.477 --> 01:30:14.297]  And so now... Just as I was there you built more stuff.
[01:30:14.438 --> 01:30:15.718]  Yeah, now I don't need all that.
[01:30:16.278 --> 01:30:19.980]  So I can just do it with a, put a bandana on, some dark glasses, I'm good.
[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:28.803]  Still got big... But what is it that so, to the Greeks, the Romans, you name it, primal about in the furnace of the volcano, just like building things?
[01:30:28.843 --> 01:30:30.204]  Well, I think it's so simple.
[01:30:30.264 --> 01:30:39.047]  Like if you see like a, you know, a 3D CNC router cutting out something really crazy out of wood, it's like the computer's doing all that.
[01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:43.229]  I have all these giant machines, but there still has to be like a dude in front of it.
[01:30:43.449 --> 01:30:43.969]  And it's just,
[01:30:44.710 --> 01:30:45.811]  You know, pressure.
[01:30:45.871 --> 01:30:46.932]  It's a human interface.
[01:30:47.012 --> 01:30:54.318]  Yeah, it's pressure like a hammer, big hammer, small hammer, you know, some kind of pressure, an anvil, and heat.
[01:30:54.679 --> 01:30:55.840]  It's only three elements.
[01:30:57.712 --> 01:31:07.077]  I've had a chance to talk to Trump some off-air, I've had him on-air, and on-air because the media always twists it and makes a big deal, but I know you were the first to endorse Trump, I know you were on a show with him, I know he likes you, he said that.
[01:31:08.258 --> 01:31:09.178]  What makes him tick?
[01:31:09.218 --> 01:31:15.401]  Because for me, he's just, he actually is like an underdog, he actually isn't, and not being screwed over.
[01:31:15.682 --> 01:31:24.246]  So he's a very aggressive alpha male, but he's not out to get the little guy, he sees America being screwed over, and wants to like, really bring in a new golden age.
[01:31:24.306 --> 01:31:25.907]  Is that an accurate, or is that statement
[01:31:25.967 --> 01:31:26.187]  Wrong.
[01:31:26.227 --> 01:31:27.248]  You know Donald Trump very well.
[01:31:27.268 --> 01:31:28.348]  I mean, who is Donald Trump?
[01:31:29.129 --> 01:31:30.309]  I think he has a big heart.
[01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:36.833]  You know, he's a good father, and I think that his kids are a big priority.
[01:31:36.853 --> 01:31:41.535]  And that says a lot about someone that puts, you know, hey, the future of my kids in the forefront.
[01:31:42.036 --> 01:31:43.817]  And it shows in his older kids.
[01:31:44.497 --> 01:32:02.342]  And I think like Eddie who runs the mail room at Trump Tower is a Puerto Rican cat that's like, you know, and he's in like Trump gets there every morning when not when it's he's been on the road, but he gets there every morning and like drinks coffee with him out of the coffee machine.
[01:32:03.355 --> 01:32:06.297]  You know, and it's like he treats it's not patronizing.
[01:32:06.357 --> 01:32:07.418]  I'm told by a lot of folks.
[01:32:07.898 --> 01:32:11.220]  He likes everybody Yeah, he really likes black people.
[01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:14.983]  I'm told it's like I don't think he really sees much people.
[01:32:15.343 --> 01:32:29.693]  Yeah, he doesn't see you that I mean, I'm I mean when I was on The Apprentice With Dennis Rodman Dennis has obvious really bad drinking problem and I suffered that for a little bit and I really saw a side of him that like, you know, I
[01:32:30.533 --> 01:32:34.656]  It was sad and, you know, sadness mixed with compassion.
[01:32:34.676 --> 01:32:39.100]  You know, and it's not stuff that... You can't fake that stuff.
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:41.061]  You know, you can't fake like you care.
[01:32:41.942 --> 01:32:43.703]  You know, you can fake happiness.
[01:32:43.723 --> 01:32:48.147]  I've had long conversations with Trump and it's like, he's like reading my mind.
[01:32:48.207 --> 01:32:48.707]  It's crazy.
[01:32:48.928 --> 01:32:49.508]  He's smart.
[01:32:49.628 --> 01:32:55.172]  I mean... Well, I think once he wins tomorrow and people really get to know him, because all they're seeing is
[01:32:56.092 --> 01:33:01.837]  Yeah, and you know I'm in the interesting position that I felt that kind of ridicule and heat
[01:33:15.687 --> 01:33:18.249]  From media and tabloids and all that stuff.
[01:33:18.269 --> 01:33:19.130]  So I know what it's like.
[01:33:19.170 --> 01:33:25.955]  They'll twist anything today I gotta say I don't want to get into all that but I know Separate from you out of the inside baseball and I talked to you confirmed it.
[01:33:26.456 --> 01:33:27.337]  You were so classy.
[01:33:27.377 --> 01:33:32.541]  You never engaged You just sat there and took it all Well a little bit
[01:33:33.157 --> 01:33:33.998]  I mean, you really did.
[01:33:34.018 --> 01:33:35.418]  I remember seeing you.
[01:33:35.919 --> 01:33:39.000]  I beat the shit out of a couple paparazzi only on Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:39.861]  No, no, I get that.
[01:33:40.021 --> 01:33:44.043]  But I mean, you never struck back in a whole Hollywood setup for PR.
[01:33:44.764 --> 01:33:45.284]  You know what?
[01:33:45.544 --> 01:33:46.505]  I just kind of like...
[01:33:47.681 --> 01:33:51.703]  Uh, you know, took my licks and just walked away.
[01:33:51.903 --> 01:33:56.945]  You know, I didn't belong where I was anyway, so, you know, I belong in my shop with my hood.
[01:33:56.965 --> 01:34:03.067]  I was about to say, you're like, people, people think like Jesse James is a wild man, the number guy on TV, reality TV, guns, everything.
[01:34:03.487 --> 01:34:05.728]  And then knowing you, it's like, it's like, whoa.
[01:34:06.932 --> 01:34:10.093]  It's like there's not even anything going on here but reality.
[01:34:10.533 --> 01:34:13.094]  It's the total difference than the emptiness of Hollywood.
[01:34:13.774 --> 01:34:15.435]  Because, you know, you've been offered tons of stuff.
[01:34:15.455 --> 01:34:16.075]  I've been offered things.
[01:34:16.135 --> 01:34:17.115]  It's like so empty.
[01:34:17.615 --> 01:34:18.996]  Like, thank God you're in Austin, brother.
[01:34:19.016 --> 01:34:19.836]  You like being in Austin?
[01:34:20.036 --> 01:34:20.436]  I dig it.
[01:34:20.456 --> 01:34:23.017]  Except for, man, it's pretty hot in August.
[01:34:23.337 --> 01:34:23.517]  It is.
[01:34:23.717 --> 01:34:24.597]  Well, plus, L.A.'
[01:34:24.557 --> 01:34:25.158]  's moving here.
[01:34:25.198 --> 01:34:28.819]  Nothing against California, but it's like, it is kind of, you know, the trendies.
[01:34:29.179 --> 01:34:29.359]  Yeah.
[01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:36.251]  So we gotta tell them, if anybody wants to move here, tell them like, oh man, it's like crazy with insults.
[01:34:36.291 --> 01:34:38.231]  Well, we got like 18 minutes left.
[01:34:38.251 --> 01:34:42.092]  I appreciate you coming down tonight during the 52-hour live broadcast.
[01:34:42.172 --> 01:34:43.533]  In just a few hours, it's midnight.
[01:34:43.893 --> 01:34:44.593]  We go into tomorrow.
[01:34:44.613 --> 01:34:46.733]  You keep saying when Trump wins tomorrow.
[01:34:46.893 --> 01:34:47.533]  You got the floor.
[01:34:47.573 --> 01:34:48.113]  Just take over.
[01:34:48.173 --> 01:34:51.214]  Jesse James doesn't, you know, just show up for nothing.
[01:34:51.474 --> 01:34:52.294]  You're kicking ass.
[01:34:52.334 --> 01:34:55.715]  Tell us where you stand, where Trump is, where you see this going.
[01:34:56.503 --> 01:35:01.725]  Um, unless, I think if there's going to be any kind of foul play or dirty tricks, I think it'll be pretty obvious.
[01:35:01.805 --> 01:35:07.548]  I think everything's so transparent now that I don't, I don't see how they can get away with it.
[01:35:07.708 --> 01:35:11.049]  And that's, that's really the only chance she has to win.
[01:35:11.089 --> 01:35:12.890]  And I think it's, I've, I've,
[01:35:13.570 --> 01:35:19.432]  I have my ear to the ground and know people all over this country and I can feel the groundswell.
[01:35:19.952 --> 01:35:21.173]  You know, can't you feel it?
[01:35:21.253 --> 01:35:22.033]  I can feel it.
[01:35:22.073 --> 01:35:31.037]  You know, I talked to my good friend Rob in Philadelphia and they tried to go to the Trump rally like, that's been about two or three weeks ago.
[01:35:31.477 --> 01:35:35.438]  They didn't get within, they got like 15 miles away from it.
[01:35:35.739 --> 01:35:38.520]  I left four hours before he was here a few months ago.
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:38.940]  Yeah.
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.942]  Brother, I was in traffic for two hours and gave up.
[01:35:43.382 --> 01:35:46.004]  Our crew got there, they had to walk two miles in.
[01:35:46.364 --> 01:35:48.205]  Yeah, I just think people are fed up.
[01:35:48.245 --> 01:35:55.729]  People want, they're, you know, they may not know him that well, but things suck so bad now they're willing to take a chance.
[01:35:55.809 --> 01:35:58.991]  And they want, they want, I think we just need, we need to be inspired.
[01:35:59.731 --> 01:36:06.475]  I like how Trump says, I'm not perfect, nobody is, but I've grown and I can really see that in the process.
[01:36:06.535 --> 01:36:08.596]  And again, Well, can you honestly look
[01:36:09.758 --> 01:36:15.282]  You know, Trump loves this country and he loves the people and he's always been thankful for decades.
[01:36:15.462 --> 01:36:16.843]  That's why the elite are so scared.
[01:36:17.023 --> 01:36:23.308]  Can you honestly look at Hillary and think that she loves this country or loves the people?
[01:36:23.328 --> 01:36:25.730]  The WikiLeaks say she hates it.
[01:36:26.450 --> 01:36:27.831]  You know, it's all about money.
[01:36:29.732 --> 01:36:34.176]  I think in her mind, she probably doesn't think she's ever done anything wrong.
[01:36:34.196 --> 01:36:39.399]  I think, you know, she's probably whipping her own fumes and, you know, thinking, oh, I'm amazing.
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:49.507]  You know, I was the former First Lady and, you know, Secretary of State, and I'm like, everybody should kiss my ring, you know, and waltz me right into the presidency.
[01:36:49.687 --> 01:36:50.307]  Entitlement!
[01:36:50.688 --> 01:36:50.968]  Yeah.
[01:36:52.049 --> 01:36:56.412]  I think she's going to be wearing an orange jumpsuit very soon.
[01:36:57.438 --> 01:37:03.622]  Well, that's why they're so scared, because you know Trump and I have been talking to folks, they say, if Trump says something, he's going to try it.
[01:37:04.362 --> 01:37:08.665]  And that's why he knows we've got trade deals that are totally one-sided.
[01:37:08.685 --> 01:37:10.106]  That's why he keeps saying, it's so easy.
[01:37:10.586 --> 01:37:11.106]  It's so easy.
[01:37:11.426 --> 01:37:13.128]  We're not going to screw Mexico or China over.
[01:37:13.528 --> 01:37:15.769]  We're just not going to have China with a 35% currency tax on us.
[01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:23.354]  Yeah, we're not going to bend over and let everybody take it to us that we want to do business with.
[01:37:23.414 --> 01:37:27.576]  Don't you love, because I know in business, I've talked to folks, you're a good business guy, you're not going to get run over, you do good deals.
[01:37:27.997 --> 01:37:30.758]  Same with me, they go, Alex Jones is a real asshole in business.
[01:37:30.778 --> 01:37:34.100]  Yeah, because I wouldn't let you run over me, I do good deals.
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:35.061]  It's the same thing.
[01:37:35.541 --> 01:37:38.263]  No, we're not screwing people, but we're not here to be screwed.
[01:37:38.823 --> 01:37:57.616]  Yeah, I think it's, you know, there's there's a difference between being an asshole and the difference between being shrewd and like, you know, on top of your game business wise, you know, and it's like there's when you get a little bit of success, there's people that'll, you know, purposely put themselves in your way to like steal from you or sue you or whatever, you know, and I've I've been through it all, man.
[01:37:58.016 --> 01:38:06.141]  Like, you know, like, and it's I think it kind of you build up a scab towards life and business and society.
[01:38:06.181 --> 01:38:08.043]  And I just, you know, I think
[01:38:08.943 --> 01:38:13.208]  Man, if you or I did some of the stuff that Hillary's done, we'd be in jail.
[01:38:13.449 --> 01:38:14.390]  Yeah, we'd be in jail.
[01:38:14.450 --> 01:38:20.637]  And it's like, you know, I think the stuff with Comey, this is how it works.
[01:38:20.878 --> 01:38:23.181]  Comey's basically a front office guy.
[01:38:24.454 --> 01:38:24.694]  Right?
[01:38:25.094 --> 01:38:25.714]  Exactly.
[01:38:25.734 --> 01:38:27.415]  It's like a spokesman.
[01:38:27.715 --> 01:38:32.015]  There's FBI headquarters and there's field offices all over the country.
[01:38:32.675 --> 01:38:36.896]  And agents handle investigations, not the home office.
[01:38:37.596 --> 01:38:39.577]  Politicos go to political dinners.
[01:38:40.117 --> 01:38:40.377]  Yeah.
[01:38:40.977 --> 01:38:52.199]  And so, for all we know, the investigation could still be going on because agents could have taken it at a field office and taken it over themselves.
[01:38:52.915 --> 01:38:54.536]  Well, that's happened actually.
[01:38:54.596 --> 01:38:57.977]  The problem is they can't get it up through the Justice Department.
[01:38:59.098 --> 01:39:03.179]  And agents can present their evidence to Congress on their own.
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:06.341]  I know you're like saying they could.
[01:39:06.361 --> 01:39:07.901]  I'm guessing you've been told this.
[01:39:07.921 --> 01:39:08.622]  I've been told this too.
[01:39:09.002 --> 01:39:10.222]  They're ready for press conferences.
[01:39:10.242 --> 01:39:11.363]  That's why Hillary's so scared.
[01:39:12.543 --> 01:39:12.723]  Yep.
[01:39:13.504 --> 01:39:16.785]  I just think, you know, I think they got her.
[01:39:18.024 --> 01:39:38.337]  You know, I think they put some kind of pressure on Comey so it didn't appear that he was, like, doing stuff to manipulate the election, but I've had a lot of friends that have been under investigation by the Feds, and any of the ones that ever rapped smack about the Feds or FBI, guess what?
[01:39:38.497 --> 01:39:39.858]  Including my own sister.
[01:39:40.799 --> 01:39:42.180]  Guess where they're all at?
[01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:43.160]  In the pen.
[01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:43.721]  Yep.
[01:39:44.861 --> 01:39:45.602]  And, you know,
[01:39:48.396 --> 01:39:54.059]  When FBI comes to interview you, they have a 97% conviction rate.
[01:39:54.099 --> 01:39:56.600]  When they interview you, they've already got you.
[01:39:58.581 --> 01:40:05.745]  They're not like the cops, like, oh man, this guy smacked his wife, we better drive out there and see what happened and do an investigation.
[01:40:05.885 --> 01:40:07.786]  No, the FBI doesn't operate like that.
[01:40:07.806 --> 01:40:10.207]  Yeah, they wouldn't even mess with Hillary if they weren't going after her.
[01:40:10.387 --> 01:40:12.048]  Yeah, they don't waste their time.
[01:40:12.068 --> 01:40:15.150]  I think it's only a matter of time.
[01:40:18.712 --> 01:40:25.115]  I don't, I'm glad it's not happening before the election because then they'll always like, oh, well, that's what I was told.
[01:40:25.195 --> 01:40:28.257]  I was told it's after the election.
[01:40:28.277 --> 01:40:31.919]  Then everybody would always say, oh, Trump only won because she went to jail.
[01:40:32.119 --> 01:40:33.580]  No, I don't want it like that.
[01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:37.942]  I want him to like have an overwhelming day tomorrow where the people speak.
[01:40:39.221 --> 01:40:42.283]  Exactly, and it's not that the police or the feds or anybody's perfect.
[01:40:42.844 --> 01:40:55.513]  What do you make of, you know, Jesse James is our guest here in studio, one of the top TV hosts, you know, but really a metal urges, you know, top blacksmith over here, expert in automobiles, you name it, I don't know how you describe it all, but really cool stuff.
[01:40:55.753 --> 01:40:57.134]  Make good French toast, too.
[01:40:57.234 --> 01:40:57.855]  Americana.
[01:40:59.396 --> 01:41:00.157]  Looking at this,
[01:41:01.573 --> 01:41:07.697]  It's that Hillary and the Globalists are out to get the country, and then they fund George Soros, this weirdo Nazi collaborator.
[01:41:09.098 --> 01:41:14.421]  One of my customers knows him, and he just says the guy just hates America.
[01:41:14.521 --> 01:41:17.863]  And I was like, well, I asked him, I said, well, what's his endgame?
[01:41:18.163 --> 01:41:25.268]  Like, if Soros is funding all this stuff, what is his, what is, he's got to, you know, if he's putting millions of dollars out there, what does he get?
[01:41:25.428 --> 01:41:26.549]  And I guess he's like a,
[01:41:27.415 --> 01:41:31.098]  He's a global commodities guy, and so... He thinks that we're collapsing and buying up.
[01:41:31.358 --> 01:41:31.518]  Yep.
[01:41:31.918 --> 01:41:32.819]  That's Soros' mindset.
[01:41:33.059 --> 01:41:34.300]  Well, here's people asking me again.
[01:41:34.861 --> 01:41:38.143]  Low taxes, prosperity, great medical care, a future!
[01:41:38.163 --> 01:41:42.606]  I mean, you know, Soros went on 16 Minutes.
[01:41:42.626 --> 01:41:43.587]  They've taken it off the web.
[01:41:43.627 --> 01:41:45.769]  We've got a clip of it, but if you put it up, they'll hit you with copyright.
[01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:47.490]  And it's Leslie Stahl.
[01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:48.411]  She's like, 1999.
[01:41:48.451 --> 01:41:53.815]  She goes, you helped round up more than 10,000 Jews in Romania and Hungary.
[01:41:54.923 --> 01:41:55.925]  Do you apologize?
[01:41:56.245 --> 01:41:57.007]  No, I do not.
[01:41:57.247 --> 01:41:58.229]  It's what I need to do.
[01:41:58.249 --> 01:42:02.757]  The point is, this guy is the biggest demon you can imagine.
[01:42:03.378 --> 01:42:03.658]  Yeah.
[01:42:04.199 --> 01:42:06.022]  He's here, and just what you said.
[01:42:07.409 --> 01:42:09.711]  He doesn't like all this prosperity and freedom.
[01:42:10.052 --> 01:42:11.753]  He just wants to mount our head on the wall.
[01:42:11.793 --> 01:42:14.676]  Like, I see somebody that's great at doing building stuff.
[01:42:14.736 --> 01:42:15.257]  I admire him.
[01:42:15.797 --> 01:42:19.040]  George Soros would see you, this great metallurgist, this great artist.
[01:42:19.541 --> 01:42:20.902]  He frickin' hates you, man.
[01:42:20.922 --> 01:42:26.688]  You know, like, it's like this total difference between we love people that produce, we hate people that produce.
[01:42:26.728 --> 01:42:31.853]  It's like Brave New World, you know, dumbing down a society, and we just want, like, Worker Jones that
[01:42:32.393 --> 01:42:37.877]  Do their part and then die off and then we'll breed more and it like, you know, he thinks we're there to serve him.
[01:42:38.137 --> 01:42:38.337]  Yep.
[01:42:38.797 --> 01:42:43.060]  And so let me ask you, I think they want to bridge too far because cops aren't perfect.
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:43.901]  There's bad cops.
[01:42:44.301 --> 01:42:45.522]  Hey, you know what?
[01:42:45.542 --> 01:42:54.348]  In a litigious society though, why aren't the Dallas, the families of the Dallas officers suing that guy direct personally?
[01:42:54.388 --> 01:42:54.808]  Hear me out.
[01:42:54.888 --> 01:42:56.349]  I totally, I totally agree.
[01:42:56.629 --> 01:43:01.713]  And anybody that lost their house or their business or anything in Ferguson, man,
[01:43:02.773 --> 01:43:03.773]  Why aren't they going after them?
[01:43:03.793 --> 01:43:04.774]  No, because they're too chivalrous.
[01:43:04.794 --> 01:43:05.534]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:43:06.074 --> 01:43:09.174]  Is that I'm somebody that's against the police state, but that's a governmental issue.
[01:43:09.454 --> 01:43:10.055]  That's the people.
[01:43:10.275 --> 01:43:13.855]  The cop has one of the hardest, craziest jobs on average.
[01:43:13.915 --> 01:43:24.317]  A lot of people, I think they judge because I have tattoos and I ride a bike and I'm from Long Beach and I grew up in the hood and they think I'm like an anti-police and I was an honorary Long Beach police officer for 15 years.
[01:43:24.698 --> 01:43:30.239]  I went to meetings every week and it's like there's no way in hell that I would want to be a cop in this state.
[01:43:30.259 --> 01:43:31.119]  Well, that was my next point.
[01:43:32.119 --> 01:43:36.641]  Cops have problems, but on average, compared to the general public, they're more committed, more involved.
[01:43:36.661 --> 01:43:37.582]  The point is, they're not perfect.
[01:43:37.862 --> 01:43:39.782]  But what do you make of Soros and Obama?
[01:43:39.883 --> 01:43:46.045]  I think that's their failure point, is when they openly tried to cause a civil war, and push groups that were saying, kill cops.
[01:43:46.165 --> 01:43:51.968]  You know, and the stuff with Trayvon Martin, Ferguson, all that stuff, Obama could have like, ended it.
[01:43:51.988 --> 01:43:52.628]  That's what I mean.
[01:43:52.728 --> 01:43:53.909]  So what do you think is behind that?
[01:43:54.329 --> 01:43:54.829]  I don't know.
[01:43:54.849 --> 01:44:02.874]  I kind of think we'll know in time, but I don't think we really know who Obama was.
[01:44:03.135 --> 01:44:14.562]  I think we all saw that one Democratic National Convention speech, and we were tired of Iraq and tired of the Bush years, and we all saw that one speech like, oh man, this is what we need.
[01:44:14.922 --> 01:44:15.802]  And we wrote that.
[01:44:15.842 --> 01:44:16.683]  We didn't vet him.
[01:44:16.723 --> 01:44:18.224]  We didn't do any of the stuff.
[01:44:18.864 --> 01:44:26.909]  That they normally do and you know all this stuff that's happening now with the one-sided with media and stuff that was all happening then.
[01:44:27.878 --> 01:44:28.578]  But now we know.
[01:44:28.898 --> 01:44:33.400]  Yeah, but there was no WikiLeaks and there was no, you know, Twitter wasn't big.
[01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:39.543]  Yeah, what do you make of the newest thing where every CNN show and MSNBC is scripted by the White House?
[01:44:39.823 --> 01:44:45.766]  Can you imagine the job where the White House and Hillary and others are running everything they do, Jesse James?
[01:44:45.806 --> 01:44:46.626]  That is crazy.
[01:44:46.886 --> 01:44:48.507]  The questions are free.
[01:44:48.727 --> 01:44:52.809]  It's like state media and it's like, you know, Russian censorship.
[01:44:53.129 --> 01:44:58.815]  You know, and that's like, we've always prided ourselves as a free-thinking, free-media society.
[01:44:58.835 --> 01:45:02.979]  Exactly, so how do you as a Democrat, because we've been to the events in Ferguson.
[01:45:02.999 --> 01:45:05.422]  No, no, no, I'm saying, I mean, how do you as a Democrat, hypothetically, no, not you.
[01:45:05.802 --> 01:45:09.726]  How is somebody as a Democrat, because I've never been a Republican, but hell, I'm with them now compared to these people.
[01:45:10.367 --> 01:45:12.169]  You sit there, how do you?
[01:45:12.609 --> 01:45:20.736]  We've had reporters in Ferguson and in Detroit and in California, just all over the country.
[01:45:20.776 --> 01:45:22.318]  I can't remember all the places.
[01:45:22.758 --> 01:45:24.339]  We've had reporters probably 30 places.
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:31.766]  And there are literal college kids bused in, funded by MoveOn and Soros, saying, deck the halls with dead cops, shoot cops.
[01:45:32.006 --> 01:45:32.927]  That's calling for murder.
[01:45:33.247 --> 01:45:37.171]  So I ask the question, how do you get college kids- They just beat their ass.
[01:45:37.791 --> 01:45:38.372]  Night Sticks.
[01:45:38.992 --> 01:45:39.252]  Again.
[01:45:53.570 --> 01:46:00.414]  It's already a tough job enough to be a cop, but to then, you know, people trying, I don't know.
[01:46:00.734 --> 01:46:01.655]  So what do you think, though?
[01:46:01.675 --> 01:46:02.315]  You're a smart guy.
[01:46:02.335 --> 01:46:03.756]  I'm asking your view.
[01:46:04.116 --> 01:46:13.442]  Why are elements of the government, of the Democrats, trying to say, deck the halls with dead cops, and then we get, in the last year, 100 cops or more murdered in cold blood.
[01:46:13.802 --> 01:46:14.903]  No one even knew their name.
[01:46:15.223 --> 01:46:18.005]  These people just kill them because MSNBC said it was cool.
[01:46:19.261 --> 01:46:20.502]  I don't know.
[01:46:20.522 --> 01:46:23.423]  It's probably the stuff that you've always said.
[01:46:23.923 --> 01:46:26.725]  Trying to start a civil war and trying to start unrest.
[01:46:26.825 --> 01:46:34.989]  I just can't put it together in my mind why someone would do that.
[01:46:35.009 --> 01:46:36.509]  I don't know.
[01:46:36.529 --> 01:46:38.010]  Because you're not a scumbag.
[01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:43.213]  Yeah, and it's just like, hey, I've got my ass kicked by the cops before.
[01:46:43.233 --> 01:46:44.854]  A few times.
[01:46:45.254 --> 01:46:45.914]  And you know what?
[01:46:45.934 --> 01:46:47.675]  I totally deserve it.
[01:46:48.789 --> 01:46:49.129]  Me too.
[01:46:49.690 --> 01:46:51.891]  You know, and it's like... Cops showed up?
[01:46:51.931 --> 01:46:59.135]  Yeah, and I think, you know, now that everybody's got Facebook Live, okay, yeah, cops gonna pull me over.
[01:46:59.175 --> 01:47:00.616]  Oh, out of context.
[01:47:00.716 --> 01:47:08.880]  I'm gonna talk smack to the cop, and I think if we took out nightsticks and went CRACK like we used to, then a lot of that would go away.
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:09.801]  Well, here's what I'll say.
[01:47:10.081 --> 01:47:13.543]  We need balance in this country, but the enemy is not local government.
[01:47:13.883 --> 01:47:15.844]  The enemy are these multinationals like Soros.
[01:47:16.772 --> 01:47:20.894]  Yeah, I think it's, you know, if people are being, it's a whole other element.
[01:47:20.934 --> 01:47:26.758]  It's one thing with civil unrest, when, because I lived through the LA riots, you know, and it was pretty bad.
[01:47:26.798 --> 01:47:29.620]  That was, that was, no one was paying people to do that.
[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:33.182]  People were genuinely pissed in South Central about Rodney King.
[01:47:33.962 --> 01:47:40.724]  You know, I don't agree with the way they went about it, but I think, you know, those guys did beat Rodney King's ass.
[01:47:40.824 --> 01:47:51.006]  Rodney King was resisting arrest, but, you know, he maybe deserved to get a thump on the back of the head or restrained, but he didn't deserve to be kicked and get his ass kicked.
[01:47:51.026 --> 01:47:57.408]  You know, I come from the days where if you ran from the cops or you took a swing at a cop, you got your ass kicked.
[01:47:57.708 --> 01:48:02.589]  And if maybe it wasn't right then, but it was back at the station when nobody could see it.
[01:48:02.729 --> 01:48:10.451]  And that, I think... My experience with the cops was, I don't want to get into it, but I mean, they would actually find out what happened and let me go even though some other guy was in a coma.
[01:48:10.752 --> 01:48:11.832]  But I wasn't looking for trouble.
[01:48:12.572 --> 01:48:14.973]  My only issue was there were some political cops were bad.
[01:48:15.033 --> 01:48:22.455]  Jesse James, in the time we have left, you, I'm just going to tell you, inside baseball, he literally makes... Yeah, basically support cops.
[01:48:22.735 --> 01:48:23.355]  That's what I say.
[01:48:23.855 --> 01:48:25.276]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:48:25.937 --> 01:48:28.819]  You compare the cops to the general jellyfish.
[01:48:28.859 --> 01:48:29.439]  You know what?
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:31.261]  Here's the bottom line.
[01:48:31.301 --> 01:48:42.650]  You can talk all the shit you want about police officers and police abuse and all this stuff, but when your 70-year-old mom is choking to death on the floor of your kitchen, you call 911.
[01:48:42.910 --> 01:48:47.173]  Well, I was about to say, it's a cop-out because it's individuals.
[01:48:47.433 --> 01:48:50.176]  And the cop is going to get there the fastest.
[01:48:50.216 --> 01:48:51.797]  That's who's going to come and try to save her.
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:49:01.508]  No, I totally agree with you that statistically you've got a couple hundred people killed a year by cops, maybe wrongfully, but you've got thousands of people saved.
[01:49:01.828 --> 01:49:06.332]  It becomes this establishment government that's so corrupt is wanting to scapegoat the police.
[01:49:06.853 --> 01:49:08.014]  And so that's what I'm against.
[01:49:08.314 --> 01:49:12.715]  Yeah, and I think, you know, Obama threw gasoline on it.
[01:49:12.755 --> 01:49:15.936]  You know, as the Commander-in-Chief, he should protect all military.
[01:49:15.976 --> 01:49:17.096]  And what's the point of that?
[01:49:17.116 --> 01:49:19.116]  He should protect all law enforcement.
[01:49:19.156 --> 01:49:20.236]  That's what he does.
[01:49:20.556 --> 01:49:22.197]  Those are the people that are protecting him.
[01:49:23.197 --> 01:49:31.779]  It basically goes right back to the situation with having, you know, Michelle Obama and Hillary and Obama treating their Secret Service like crap.
[01:49:31.939 --> 01:49:34.059]  So what's the psychological calculus by them?
[01:49:35.339 --> 01:49:37.660]  I think they're in positions that they didn't earn.
[01:49:38.737 --> 01:49:38.797]  And
[01:49:57.284 --> 01:49:57.664]  Thank you.
[01:49:57.684 --> 01:49:58.344]  Look at these guys.
[01:49:58.364 --> 01:49:59.145]  Those guys are awesome.
[01:49:59.165 --> 01:50:00.865]  And the citizens and the cooks.
[01:50:00.885 --> 01:50:01.186]  Yeah.
[01:50:01.406 --> 01:50:03.366]  Obama, Hillary, and Michelle.
[01:50:03.386 --> 01:50:04.407]  Look at all those guys.
[01:50:04.447 --> 01:50:06.528]  Like, oh, I'm big-timer.
[01:50:06.548 --> 01:50:07.768]  I'm flying on a big jet.
[01:50:07.828 --> 01:50:08.589]  Look at you.
[01:50:09.129 --> 01:50:10.189]  You guys owe me.
[01:50:10.409 --> 01:50:11.030]  To elitism.
[01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.730]  Yeah.
[01:50:12.170 --> 01:50:13.471]  Let me ask you this question then.
[01:50:15.772 --> 01:50:24.015]  Looking at this and looking at how the so-called left operates, what would they do, Jesse James, if they had their way with America?
[01:50:25.966 --> 01:50:34.169]  I think basically the plan is to keep everybody on some kind of government assistance and flood as many people in there.
[01:50:35.889 --> 01:50:39.451]  It's basically not having a country.
[01:50:39.531 --> 01:50:41.491]  Open borders and all that stuff.
[01:50:41.611 --> 01:50:44.032]  It's basically not having a country anymore.
[01:50:44.692 --> 01:50:49.514]  All the stuff that we fought for 200 years and fought several wars to defend.
[01:50:50.294 --> 01:50:51.314]  They don't believe in that.
[01:50:51.434 --> 01:50:53.975]  They don't believe in the American Dream.
[01:50:54.355 --> 01:51:05.978]  And, you know, it sounds, you know, every word of that Pledge of Allegiance, and every word of the Declaration of Independence, and every word of the Constitution, those guys, that stuff's mean.
[01:51:06.038 --> 01:51:08.418]  And people can say, oh, that's America, that's a cult.
[01:51:08.438 --> 01:51:10.379]  I used to even think that ten years ago, but then I realized,
[01:51:11.596 --> 01:51:12.998]  Except what else there is.
[01:51:13.338 --> 01:51:14.219]  We don't do this.
[01:51:14.259 --> 01:51:17.564]  Here's the thing.
[01:51:17.824 --> 01:51:22.790]  Go to Calexico in Mexico or Tijuana and then go right over the border.
[01:51:22.850 --> 01:51:23.731]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:51:23.851 --> 01:51:26.034]  Go right over the border to National City.
[01:51:26.775 --> 01:51:35.579]  There's no difference between, you know, the borders leak into America and it makes all the... No, I agree!
[01:51:35.619 --> 01:51:37.940]  ...all the states that are right over the border... That's what I'm saying.
[01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:39.421]  ...like a third world country.
[01:51:39.641 --> 01:51:42.622]  And pretty soon that's going to go farther and farther and farther.
[01:51:42.642 --> 01:51:46.804]  You know, and the bottom line, I think, is we just can't afford it.
[01:51:47.887 --> 01:52:09.394]  Art, the tax dollars we pay, and I pay a lot of taxes, and everybody in this country that pays taxes, it's not enough to afford millions of people to come and get healthcare and all this stuff, and it's like, you know, yeah, come here, be legal, work your ass off, and pay your taxes, do your fair share, not come here and manipulate the system.
[01:52:09.414 --> 01:52:12.095]  It shouldn't be special to be an American.
[01:52:12.642 --> 01:52:15.924]  Now I want to add this before we close and a few other final points with Jesse James here with us.
[01:52:16.705 --> 01:52:31.055]  I've been over your house before, hung out, shot guns, you know, kids are part of the same events, sports and stuff, and every time I'm like, hey, your guns are really great, we ought to do some business, blah, blah, you're not even into business, you're just like separately doing it yourself, but let's spend some time
[01:52:31.775 --> 01:52:40.779]  Because this is what America is, is men and women going out with passion, creating art, creating firearms, creating literature, creating music, creating culture.
[01:52:41.339 --> 01:52:42.760]  Let's talk about Jesse James.
[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:47.042]  He didn't come here to talk about you, but it's all what Donald Trump's pushing, this American dream.
[01:52:47.382 --> 01:52:51.964]  Let's talk about what you're doing with your firearms and this great Breitbart article
[01:52:53.044 --> 01:53:05.712]  I have here, where you're launching a nationwide movement, got it right here somewhere, to launch this whole 2nd Amendment operation, a 2nd Amendment basic defense group.
[01:53:06.092 --> 01:53:13.756]  That is super exciting, because look, I've always said the gun manufacturers... Yeah, I was pretty honored to be named in that, like the NRA, you know.
[01:53:16.396 --> 01:53:30.966]  I have a licensing company and handle a brand for the NRA called NRA Originals, and they have a really great relationship with them, and they asked me if I would want to be part of it, and I'm sure, and it was like, wow, like, I might have to buy a suit.
[01:53:32.587 --> 01:53:38.891]  But it's awesome, because, because, listen, I've always said this, it's not enough for people to be firearms manufacturers.
[01:53:39.887 --> 01:53:41.990]  We do have to get aggressive politically.
[01:53:42.010 --> 01:53:43.392]  And they go, we don't want to be aggressive.
[01:53:43.432 --> 01:53:44.774]  We'll be targeted by Bloomberg.
[01:53:45.635 --> 01:53:46.296]  F him, man.
[01:53:46.316 --> 01:53:48.459]  And get ready to blame this for our stations.
[01:53:48.479 --> 01:53:49.560]  But I'm going to say it because I mean it.
[01:53:50.061 --> 01:53:54.146]  Fuck Michael Bloomberg, who has 15 bodyguards and all these weapons.
[01:53:54.206 --> 01:53:55.748]  No, I don't like Michael Bloomberg.
[01:53:56.988 --> 01:54:18.284]  Because when I was on the Letterman Show one time, and I had a front-engine dragster that we took down 8th Avenue, and the side street where the Letterman Show was filmed, and I did like 140 miles an hour down the street in Boston, and Bloomberg came down there and shut us down.
[01:54:19.545 --> 01:54:23.768]  Well, I mean, look, my thing is, listen, you don't have bodyguards, you got yourself.
[01:54:24.429 --> 01:54:29.973]  I don't either, but the frustration is, I go to some public events, I've got to now, man, the general public can't pay for that.
[01:54:30.033 --> 01:54:33.816]  How uncool is it we have video of him with 15 bodyguards with guns?
[01:54:33.856 --> 01:54:35.317]  Yeah, but that's just, you're just talking like...
[01:54:36.218 --> 01:54:49.461]  When you get out on the extreme edges of the country, California, New York, you're going to have all these politicians that like, you know, they're trying to be like the next Ralph Nader, you know, I'm going to ban the Pinot because they catch on fire, you know?
[01:54:49.541 --> 01:54:51.781]  No, I agree, but it's game over, man.
[01:54:51.921 --> 01:54:54.602]  You have six bodyguards, Michael Moore.
[01:54:54.922 --> 01:54:57.062]  They've actually physically accosted me before.
[01:54:57.483 --> 01:54:59.103]  You don't get guns when I don't.
[01:54:59.523 --> 01:55:04.064]  You know, it's like you don't have a right to bitch about guns when you have a freaking bodyguard.
[01:55:04.164 --> 01:55:09.305]  Yeah, but they're trying to make all these rules and laws to like, oh yeah, he's the guy that banned the big gulps, you know?
[01:55:09.385 --> 01:55:10.306]  I agree.
[01:55:10.606 --> 01:55:15.067]  It's self-aggrandizing, which makes them like, oh, I'm the guy, you know, I get stuff done.
[01:55:15.127 --> 01:55:20.729]  And really it's just, you know, imposing rules and regulations on a society.
[01:55:20.789 --> 01:55:24.530]  It doesn't work because gun violence in New York and
[01:55:25.470 --> 01:55:30.672]  California is horrible, and they're two of the strictest states on gun rules, so how is that helping?
[01:55:30.692 --> 01:55:34.173]  JJFU.com, JesseJamesFU.com.
[01:55:36.134 --> 01:55:38.194]  We've talked for years about getting you on air.
[01:55:38.614 --> 01:55:39.675]  It's great to have you here.
[01:55:40.175 --> 01:55:43.576]  I'm going to run a tape here and see you out, but please come back.
[01:55:44.036 --> 01:55:47.997]  I know we've talked, like, hey, we ought to show this blacksmithing, and I'm busy, you're busy, we don't do it.
[01:55:48.117 --> 01:55:49.398]  How tall is Charlotte getting?
[01:55:50.546 --> 01:55:51.967]  She's like a little tiny.
[01:55:52.007 --> 01:55:52.847]  Almost as big as your daughter.
[01:55:53.507 --> 01:55:54.868]  No, I think she might be taller.
[01:55:54.888 --> 01:56:00.090]  She's like, I looked at her last night and I'm like, wow, you're like, you're not like a little tiny baby anymore.
[01:56:00.130 --> 01:56:01.150]  You're like a tall kid.
[01:56:01.851 --> 01:56:06.433]  It's great that our daughters are best friends, but it's like, it's like Charlotte and Sonny world.
[01:56:06.873 --> 01:56:08.414]  That's all she talks about.
[01:56:08.434 --> 01:56:08.954]  And it's great.
[01:56:08.994 --> 01:56:13.196]  I'm just, I just, I'm, I'm doing, I guess a concert last night, but thanks for taking them out.
[01:56:13.256 --> 01:56:14.756]  But, uh, you know, that's why I fight.
[01:56:15.577 --> 01:56:15.797]  Yep.
[01:56:16.117 --> 01:56:16.337]  Yep.
[01:56:16.457 --> 01:56:18.918]  Give them, leave them something a little better than what we had.
[01:56:20.009 --> 01:56:20.609]  Absolutely.
[01:56:20.689 --> 01:56:26.132]  Well, you know, that's what gets to me is, I'm not perfect, but I'm not out to screw people over.
[01:56:26.813 --> 01:56:36.778]  And I look at Obama... Here's the, you know, I'll tell a little story that like, that's one of my favorite stories about being an American.
[01:56:37.199 --> 01:56:43.042]  So when I was in north of Baghdad, and I landed in Baghdad, ironically, on election day 2005.
[01:56:43.122 --> 01:56:46.564]  Joe was telling me earlier, I didn't know this, you went into a combat zone.
[01:56:46.704 --> 01:56:48.285]  Yeah, yeah, so I landed there.
[01:56:48.425 --> 01:56:52.706]  I went on my own and it was at a time where the war had fallen out of favor.
[01:56:52.806 --> 01:56:53.627]  Well, I didn't know this.
[01:56:53.807 --> 01:56:54.467]  Media-wise?
[01:56:54.567 --> 01:56:55.627]  Yeah, hold on.
[01:56:55.928 --> 01:56:57.708]  It impressed Joe and the troops.
[01:56:57.948 --> 01:56:59.509]  You went in a war zone.
[01:56:59.909 --> 01:57:05.411]  Yeah, I went in 2003, a month after the war broke out, went to Baghdad and then I went back in 05.
[01:57:06.011 --> 01:57:12.414]  And when I went to a field hospital there, north of Baghdad, where it was kind of the main combat hospital.
[01:57:13.442 --> 01:57:15.186]  And, uh, you know, it was pretty bad.
[01:57:15.206 --> 01:57:20.619]  You know, there was like, you know, two or three kids a day getting killed by IEDs and stuff, and they, uh...
[01:57:22.106 --> 01:57:32.813]  The thing that struck me is all the doctors were like from John Hopkins and George Washington University and they did like, you know, 30 day stints there as volunteers, you know, meaning trauma surgeons and stuff.
[01:57:32.853 --> 01:57:41.478]  And so these guys were like, you know, and I went into the field hospital to meet some guys that were laid up that weren't bad enough to go to Ramstein, you know, Germany.
[01:57:41.678 --> 01:57:41.978]  Yeah.
[01:57:42.118 --> 01:57:49.643]  And they were taking care of some troops and like they had an, I was like, Whoa, this guy's like, he looked, you know, like an Iraqi guy.
[01:57:50.618 --> 01:58:15.352]  And he was wearing al-Qaeda like kind of garb and they had his whole head opened up and like they his whole skull was peeled open they had part of his skull cap off and I said the one doctor I was kind of walking me around and like I remember the guys are like hey what's up he's doing brain surgery and like shook my hand and I was like just the whole visual of it like burned into my brain and I asked him I said man you know this is like
[01:58:16.172 --> 01:58:24.623]  There's a war going on right now, really bad, and we're in the main combat hospital, and you have one of our enemy in here, and you're trying to fix them.
[01:58:24.663 --> 01:58:25.985]  You're digging metal shards.
[01:58:26.005 --> 01:58:26.746]  Because we're better than them.
[01:58:27.006 --> 01:58:30.551]  No, and he said, he's all, yeah man, we're Americans, that's what we do.
[01:58:30.571 --> 01:58:31.873]  I didn't know you were going to say that.
[01:58:32.273 --> 01:58:35.318]  Yep.
[01:58:35.338 --> 01:58:37.701]  And that whole trip changed my life.
[01:58:38.442 --> 01:58:41.126]  And that's the essence of what this country is about.
[01:58:41.166 --> 01:58:46.954]  It's like, hey, we can be Democrat or Republican or whatever, but first and foremost, we're Americans.
[01:58:47.575 --> 01:58:54.063]  And when this is all over on Wednesday, hopefully we'll get back to going to, you know, everybody working together.
[01:58:54.083 --> 01:58:57.868]  Well, I didn't mean to steal your thunder, I don't think it did, but that is Americana, not that we're perfect.
[01:58:57.888 --> 01:58:58.529]  Yeah, yeah, you know.
[01:58:58.569 --> 01:59:01.332]  That we have always been the standard of the best, not that we're perfect.
[01:59:01.632 --> 01:59:03.915]  Why does our media point out where we falter then?
[01:59:04.236 --> 01:59:05.097]  What is the whole point of that?
[01:59:05.277 --> 01:59:05.758]  Yeah, well...
[01:59:07.287 --> 01:59:11.449]  I think it's going to get to a point where, you know, we're used to doing things a certain way.
[01:59:11.509 --> 01:59:13.569]  We're used to going in and fixing everything.
[01:59:13.969 --> 01:59:17.391]  And, you know, if we keep going down the road we are, we're not going to be able to do that.
[01:59:17.411 --> 01:59:25.614]  We're not going to be able, we're going to, you know, dip down to third world country status where our military won't be strong and our resources won't be strong.
[01:59:25.634 --> 01:59:30.716]  And I always want to be like, oh yeah, America, you know, these people were stranded.
[01:59:30.776 --> 01:59:31.836]  We went in and saved them.
[01:59:31.856 --> 01:59:34.137]  You know, that's what it's all about and I think
[01:59:35.748 --> 01:59:46.794]  You know, if we don't take care of ourselves first and foremost, and number one, take care of our people, our vets, our homeless, the elderly, take care of those people, then we don't have anything.
[01:59:47.054 --> 01:59:47.554]  You're right.
[01:59:48.015 --> 01:59:55.819]  How we treat the least of us, we treat ourselves, as Christ said, and it really is true that we have an establishment that's threatened
[01:59:56.559 --> 02:00:04.701]  By the esprit de corps and strength of America, even though they run the country, they fundamentally can't stand the honorableness of it because they're so dishonorable.
[02:00:04.801 --> 02:00:17.204]  And never before have we had a candidate like Hillary Clinton, who is so evil, so dishonorable, all the WikiLeaks proving it, that she is fit for a prison cell not to run this country.
[02:00:17.264 --> 02:00:23.025]  And then there's Donald Trump, who was like sent from central casting from heaven.
[02:00:24.546 --> 02:00:30.999]  To put up, because I put up with crap, you put up with crap, he's put up with a hundred times what we have, and I just hope and pray you're right.
[02:00:31.079 --> 02:00:32.381]  I think he's going to be elected tomorrow.
[02:00:33.163 --> 02:00:36.509]  If they steal it, it's a whole other ball of wax, but regardless, you grew up being Jesse James.
[02:00:37.483 --> 02:00:50.852]  You know, as an American patriot, as an entrepreneur, as a father, that Trump has won already just by putting the issue of Americanism, not globalism, anti-cronyism, true free market.
[02:00:51.192 --> 02:00:52.993]  He has turned the page.
[02:00:53.153 --> 02:00:55.475]  He'll reach across the line and make stuff happen.
[02:00:55.495 --> 02:00:57.676]  So you're convinced he's getting elected tomorrow?
[02:00:58.156 --> 02:00:58.697]  I think so.
[02:00:59.237 --> 02:00:59.697]  You know what?
[02:01:00.878 --> 02:01:01.699]  I'm pretty confident.
[02:01:02.509 --> 02:01:07.732]  Hey, I know the polls and the internal ones, which, you know, people pay to get, but aren't the ones on the news.
[02:01:08.573 --> 02:01:12.575]  If they, if they, well, they only had 7% more Democrats, which I think demographics.
[02:01:12.875 --> 02:01:23.122]  Yeah, they were trying, uh, who was AP or someone was trying, uh, reverse psychology saying like, well, you know, in Texas, if you don't vote for Trump, you'll benefit more.
[02:01:23.142 --> 02:01:26.924]  Like, you know, so that means he's going to win Texas.
[02:01:27.344 --> 02:01:27.944]  I think it's going to be.
[02:01:27.964 --> 02:01:28.645]  Well, how could he not?
[02:01:28.765 --> 02:01:32.287]  If he wins Michigan and Florida and New Hampshire, it's over.
[02:01:32.407 --> 02:01:36.570]  Well, Hillary in an hour is doing an emergency midnight deal in Michigan.
[02:01:36.590 --> 02:01:37.611]  What does that tell you, Jesse James?
[02:01:37.871 --> 02:01:38.512]  In fact, you're here.
[02:01:38.532 --> 02:01:39.732]  I've been trying to get you here for years.
[02:01:39.752 --> 02:01:40.073]  You're here.
[02:01:40.093 --> 02:01:41.273]  Other points you want to make?
[02:01:41.293 --> 02:01:41.974]  We're going to shut this down.
[02:01:41.994 --> 02:01:43.875]  I'm going to air a tape and come back with the next host.
[02:01:44.355 --> 02:01:44.796]  I'm good, man.
[02:01:45.967 --> 02:01:50.329]  Well, I'm just glad that I've tried to get you on a few times, and you're like, yeah, yeah, but it never happens.
[02:01:50.369 --> 02:01:51.629]  Let's go to dinner this weekend.
[02:01:51.909 --> 02:01:52.770]  Let's do it.
[02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:53.610]  But what got you out?
[02:01:53.650 --> 02:01:55.051]  Just the epic level of what's happening?
[02:01:55.471 --> 02:01:55.991]  I think so.
[02:01:56.051 --> 02:02:02.794]  I think it's trying to like, I think, try to put a human voice to the, you know, it's the
[02:02:03.474 --> 02:02:25.142]  Kind of the last night of the status of this country the way it is, you know, I think I think Tomorrow's a significant day for us in our lifetime but I think tonight is like, you know, maybe someone that'll be watching this and Realize that you know, I'm not just some schmo, you know, I have some ideas in my head, but you know ultimately I
[02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:33.395]  You know, I might talk a lot of smack, but ultimately I want the better for this country and for everybody in it.
[02:02:33.435 --> 02:02:42.583]  That's deep, because even, let's say Trump loses or wins, making the right decision against the establishment, the communist Chinese, the Saudi Arabians, the big banks, they're all against Trump.
[02:02:42.984 --> 02:02:46.507]  If people claim they're against the establishment, how could you not be for Trump?
[02:02:46.787 --> 02:02:49.029]  The establishment is against the American system.
[02:02:49.537 --> 02:02:50.578]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:02:50.658 --> 02:02:53.962]  They want to, you know, they want to own us and take everything over.
[02:02:53.982 --> 02:02:57.946]  All right, I'm going to do this because... I don't know about that whole Banks poisoning our water thing, though.
[02:02:58.006 --> 02:02:58.747]  Oh, that's the Banks.
[02:02:58.847 --> 02:02:59.688]  It's a little bit twisted.
[02:03:00.328 --> 02:03:09.578]  I've got the White House Science Czar admitting they put hydrofluorosilic acid... So, one of my friends from California sent me some of the... a picture of your silvers.
[02:03:09.798 --> 02:03:11.040]  What is the drops thing you have?
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:12.720]  No, no, colloidal silver is a great one.
[02:03:12.740 --> 02:03:15.181]  Yeah, he's like, look, show Alex Jones, I take this every day.
[02:03:15.301 --> 02:03:17.661]  When a regular antibiotic doesn't work, it's been proven.
[02:03:17.961 --> 02:03:18.862]  You gotta give me some of that.
[02:03:18.882 --> 02:03:20.722]  Brother, I only, look, you've known me a while.
[02:03:20.882 --> 02:03:21.802]  I only go with what I believe.
[02:03:21.842 --> 02:03:22.702]  You're not gonna give me the shits, is it?
[02:03:22.722 --> 02:03:24.423]  I mean, no, no, I love, I'm not giving you the shits.
[02:03:24.783 --> 02:03:26.183]  I'm not giving you the shits.
[02:03:26.203 --> 02:03:27.503]  You gotta delay that, we're on some stages.
[02:03:27.523 --> 02:03:30.784]  Let me tell you, X2, it's the good halogen.
[02:03:31.224 --> 02:03:31.444]  Okay.
[02:03:31.464 --> 02:03:35.165]  Bromine, bromide, chlorine, fluoride are the bad halogens in our glands.
[02:03:36.394 --> 02:03:41.335]  Only iodine that's in the food and the water, but it's very low level now, is there.
[02:03:41.895 --> 02:03:44.396]  All cultures that have it, Japanese the longest live, high iodine.
[02:03:46.016 --> 02:03:48.537]  We sell iodine that's blue.
[02:03:48.837 --> 02:03:50.397]  Real iodine's not red, it's blue.
[02:03:50.857 --> 02:03:51.598]  The crystal's blue.
[02:03:51.858 --> 02:03:52.078]  Yeah.
[02:03:52.678 --> 02:03:56.019]  I was a big, I'm a tough guy like you, I was a big fat ass, gained all this weight.
[02:03:56.539 --> 02:03:57.859]  I work out less than I used to.
[02:03:57.959 --> 02:04:05.001]  I've lost 45 pounds just taking Survival Shield X2 iodine because it's really the good halogen.
[02:04:05.241 --> 02:04:05.881]  But here's the problem.
[02:04:07.045 --> 02:04:08.803]  Two weeks to three weeks into taking it.
[02:04:10.126 --> 02:04:13.707]  Oh man, dude, oil coming out of your body?
[02:04:13.827 --> 02:04:15.008]  It's heavy because of the toxins.
[02:04:15.048 --> 02:04:17.388]  So, not that you need it, but I'm going to give you some X2.
[02:04:17.648 --> 02:04:18.349]  Alright, I'll try it.
[02:04:18.369 --> 02:04:19.949]  Now, in closing, I'm going to air this tape here.
[02:04:20.329 --> 02:04:21.509]  I want to air a couple clips.
[02:04:21.529 --> 02:04:28.011]  I want to air Conway explodes on Jake Tapper saying, you keep saying Trump's going to lose, now he's heading polls back off.
[02:04:28.492 --> 02:04:29.612]  We've got Clinton rape whistle.
[02:04:29.632 --> 02:04:30.792]  I'm going to air that in line.
[02:04:31.312 --> 02:04:32.073]  MSNBC.
[02:04:32.093 --> 02:04:38.215]  What's up with all the, I just can't wrap my head around that whole child molestation, sex trafficking thing.
[02:04:38.275 --> 02:04:38.915]  Let's talk about it.
[02:04:41.032 --> 02:04:41.432]  Here's the deal.
[02:04:42.294 --> 02:04:44.016]  We like beautiful, full-grown women.
[02:04:44.036 --> 02:04:44.376]  We're men.
[02:04:44.717 --> 02:04:46.919]  No, but no... God, do you think that stuff's true?
[02:04:47.220 --> 02:04:47.700]  Let me tell you.
[02:04:50.624 --> 02:04:52.687]  Look at the Catholic Church, not bashing Catholics.
[02:04:52.707 --> 02:04:52.847]  Look at...
[02:04:54.321 --> 02:04:57.142]  Sandusky and look at what happened to Penn State.
[02:04:57.663 --> 02:04:58.603]  Yeah.
[02:04:58.623 --> 02:05:13.850]  Well, I mean, there's always going to be evil pedophiles and stuff all over the world, but I'm just talking about that one with Podesta and that stuff because I read the emails and like them talking about pizza and hot dog and like... And we got three little kids in the hot tub for entertainment.
[02:05:14.170 --> 02:05:16.472]  Yeah, I can't like... We're not going to that party.
[02:05:16.752 --> 02:05:18.833]  Yeah, like I don't know what I wanted to see.
[02:05:18.853 --> 02:05:21.134]  We might go to the party and like kill people, but we're not going.
[02:05:21.214 --> 02:05:22.715]  I don't know what I wanted to see.
[02:05:24.167 --> 02:05:29.751]  In the emails, but I, that's, you know, I think like pedophilia and child molestation.
[02:05:29.771 --> 02:05:30.612]  That's the line right there.
[02:05:30.632 --> 02:05:31.432]  It's grounds for death.
[02:05:31.712 --> 02:05:32.233]  Grounds for death.
[02:05:32.253 --> 02:05:32.493]  You know?
[02:05:32.513 --> 02:05:33.153]  Uh, yeah.
[02:05:33.273 --> 02:05:36.476]  I don't normally have visions of killing people, but when we do talk about it, I start having visions.
[02:05:36.516 --> 02:05:42.440]  I don't, I didn't realize, you know, really is the whole seediness of that whole side taking that.
[02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:43.841]  Well, let me give you the intel.
[02:05:44.910 --> 02:05:49.415]  I was told a week before it came out that the NYPD forced the FBI to come out with a new deal.
[02:05:49.455 --> 02:05:53.278]  Not the groundswell FBI's good folks, but the top.
[02:05:54.179 --> 02:05:56.742]  And they've admitted, they have this 15 year old, he's sexting.
[02:05:57.362 --> 02:05:59.384]  I've been shown by law enforcement what he was doing.
[02:05:59.544 --> 02:06:00.886]  Yeah, with the Anthony Weiner deal.
[02:06:00.926 --> 02:06:01.386]  Anthony Weiner.
[02:06:02.047 --> 02:06:09.294]  So, I don't know if all those thousands of emails in John Podesta's and his brother's situation are real, but here's the deal.
[02:06:10.373 --> 02:06:23.888]  Podesta's brother, the top lobbyist in DC, is in a Washington Post article in 2004, excuse the data dumps that you asked, saying, I take photos of naked teenagers, and this is our deviant art, this is our right, we're going to show it.
[02:06:24.429 --> 02:06:24.889]  And there's that.
[02:06:25.470 --> 02:06:29.353]  Then there's all this weird, and we're not joking about Satanism, like a tattoo or something.
[02:06:29.873 --> 02:06:33.716]  We mean real Aleister Crowley black magic in the emails.
[02:06:33.776 --> 02:06:37.478]  This stuff is what, like, this is the stuff that you've been talking about for years.
[02:06:38.379 --> 02:06:39.420]  This type of behavior.
[02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:44.123]  It is, and because I would cover it, I had high level FBI.
[02:06:44.163 --> 02:06:48.866]  And this is what, this is the stuff that like people, oh he's a conspiracy theorist and stuff like that.
[02:06:49.306 --> 02:06:49.847]  And it's like,
[02:06:51.236 --> 02:06:59.502]  I looked at it and I'm like, man, this is like besides the Soros and him funding, you know, trying to create a civil war and stuff like that, but seeing like this
[02:07:00.619 --> 02:07:06.523]  Accusations of pedophilia and stuff that looks like it's probably true.
[02:07:06.543 --> 02:07:14.147]  They're definitely not talking about pizzas and they're not talking about... They're like, we got $65,000 of hot dogs tonight.
[02:07:14.287 --> 02:07:17.269]  And the Epstein guy with the jet to this private island.
[02:07:17.309 --> 02:07:17.889]  And Hillary.
[02:07:17.989 --> 02:07:18.290]  Yeah.
[02:07:18.350 --> 02:07:21.672]  And now Eric Prince of Blackwater who's a patriot.
[02:07:22.092 --> 02:07:24.153]  And I want to say this on air because I did the research.
[02:07:24.673 --> 02:07:26.635]  Every time a mercenary did something wrong,
[02:07:27.415 --> 02:07:29.438]  With British companies, you know, they blame Blackwater.
[02:07:29.779 --> 02:07:31.842]  Blackwater was one of the most respected companies.
[02:07:32.383 --> 02:07:38.713]  Prince has come out and said, I have law enforcement sources, Hillary was on the plane, it's pedophilia with kids.
[02:07:38.733 --> 02:07:39.414]  That's Breitbart.
[02:07:40.215 --> 02:07:41.998]  So, let me just give you the full scoop.
[02:07:43.434 --> 02:07:46.316]  I had family in the CIA when I was growing up.
[02:07:47.076 --> 02:07:50.098]  And I don't mean like analyst stuff, I mean trigger-pulling people.
[02:07:50.678 --> 02:07:50.998]  Okay?
[02:07:51.659 --> 02:07:54.541]  And so I grew up with like, because they go after families.
[02:07:54.561 --> 02:07:56.121]  It's like breeds of dogs though.
[02:07:56.362 --> 02:07:58.263]  That's cool because my dad was a drug dealer.
[02:07:59.124 --> 02:08:00.145]  Well, then you know how it works.
[02:08:00.986 --> 02:08:09.535]  The point is, is that I was always taught there's a corrupt group in the government, they're involved in all this evil, and we have to protect America, this is going on, this is happening.
[02:08:09.555 --> 02:08:10.656]  I'm not in the CIA myself.
[02:08:10.676 --> 02:08:14.280]  I used to have some family that was in it, and they said, no, it's Satanists, they're hurting kids.
[02:08:14.881 --> 02:08:19.666]  Then I learned about more, I talked about it on air, but just in closing, Jesse, I don't want to go on a whole diatribe.
[02:08:21.348 --> 02:08:28.836]  Then, I was told by law enforcement, yes, Hillary's involved, yes, it's happening, yes, they're doing it, yes, Anthony Weiner.
[02:08:29.097 --> 02:08:33.882]  Then it comes out, they're at these events, Aleister Crowley stuff, they're making jokes.
[02:08:34.242 --> 02:08:35.604]  Then there's all these weird code words.
[02:08:36.044 --> 02:08:42.391]  The truth is, I don't know how far it goes, because I'm not, obviously... I mean, it's so... it's... that's like...
[02:08:43.453 --> 02:08:45.894]  You know, that's like a movie evil.
[02:08:46.774 --> 02:08:47.514]  You know what I mean?
[02:08:47.554 --> 02:08:48.874]  It's like a horror film evil.
[02:08:49.394 --> 02:08:58.256]  All I knew was I was brought up with... It's so hard reading that stuff, but it's not presented in like a, you know, sensationalized manner.
[02:08:58.296 --> 02:09:07.598]  To read it in a matter-of-fact manner, the way the emails lay it out and the way, I guess, Reddit and stuff, it's like... Well, they're like, we're gonna have three kids and a hot tub for your enjoyment.
[02:09:08.598 --> 02:09:09.758]  And that isn't hard to figure out.
[02:09:10.138 --> 02:09:12.399]  Yeah, like, I can't... I don't know.
[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:23.932]  And then you gotta look at it like, I don't even want anybody that's like remotely associated with pedophilia to be the Commander-in-Chief.
[02:09:24.904 --> 02:09:25.484]  Exactly.
[02:09:26.704 --> 02:09:39.547]  Even if it's partially true or 3% true, I don't want them anywhere near making any kind of decisions for schools and kids and anything like that.
[02:09:39.847 --> 02:09:46.169]  Or if they were married to someone or if someone they were related to did that and they covered it up.
[02:09:47.389 --> 02:09:52.113]  I just think it's been going on so long with that kind of behavior and corruption and stealing that
[02:10:03.556 --> 02:10:06.917]  Those people probably don't even think they're doing anything wrong.
[02:10:07.477 --> 02:10:09.498]  They probably think, you know... Oh, I agree.
[02:10:09.798 --> 02:10:18.681]  You know, it's we owe them and they're elitists and we should be bowing down to them and I think it's like... Instead of beating their brains out with a baseball bat?
[02:10:18.941 --> 02:10:24.724]  It's time that, you know, we have some kind of integrity again and some kind of clarity.
[02:10:24.744 --> 02:10:25.724]  Let me ask you that in closing.
[02:10:26.949 --> 02:10:28.732]  Why are they so scared of Trump?
[02:10:28.972 --> 02:10:30.915]  Because politicians all offer rhetoric.
[02:10:30.936 --> 02:10:31.556]  Don Jr.
[02:10:31.577 --> 02:10:32.238]  said it the best.
[02:10:32.318 --> 02:10:38.607]  It's like Hollywood's a kind of, or not Hollywood, well, basically, Hollywood, Washington, but Washington
[02:10:39.642 --> 02:10:52.435]  Is the kind of town where everybody, Democrat or Republican, they're all getting money and they're all getting paid for stuff like Hillary does, and everybody takes care of everyone, and Trump represents that, hey, the gig's up.
[02:10:52.895 --> 02:10:53.415]  We're done.
[02:10:53.576 --> 02:10:54.176]  Clean house.
[02:10:54.196 --> 02:10:54.777]  I agree.
[02:10:54.797 --> 02:10:56.759]  The fact that they're shitting their pants.
[02:10:57.179 --> 02:11:03.685]  All these politicians and all these crooked media outlets, because what is like Wolf Blitzer and all these guys that like,
[02:11:04.426 --> 02:11:08.509]  You know, basically scammed and cheated to get some kind of edge.
[02:11:08.790 --> 02:11:11.112]  What are they going to do after tomorrow when Trump wins?
[02:11:11.312 --> 02:11:13.794]  How are they going to look and have any kind of integrity?
[02:11:14.194 --> 02:11:14.915]  And I agree with you.
[02:11:15.295 --> 02:11:19.478]  If they try to steal it, though, and they've been caught rigging everything, it blows them up worse.
[02:11:19.538 --> 02:11:23.482]  That's why we can't lose unless Soros causes some type of major race right now.
[02:11:23.982 --> 02:11:26.784]  In closing, Jesse James, an hour and 20 minutes with us.
[02:11:26.864 --> 02:11:27.285]  It's been amazing.
[02:11:27.305 --> 02:11:28.146]  You already said in closing.
[02:11:28.806 --> 02:11:29.727]  I've already said it five times.
[02:11:30.327 --> 02:11:31.188]  We'll get going in 20 hours.
[02:11:31.268 --> 02:11:31.668]  I love this.
[02:11:32.249 --> 02:11:33.090]  I finally got you on air.
[02:11:33.370 --> 02:11:34.531]  How many hours you got left?
[02:11:34.551 --> 02:11:34.531]  38?
[02:11:34.651 --> 02:11:35.792]  How long you wanna go?
[02:11:36.072 --> 02:11:37.373]  Nah, we're gonna get you outta here.
[02:11:37.413 --> 02:11:41.236]  But it's like, it's after, shit, at 9 o'clock, the TV's watching me.
[02:11:41.436 --> 02:11:41.577]  It's 1020.
[02:11:41.737 --> 02:11:42.998]  I get up at 5am.
[02:11:43.098 --> 02:11:44.539]  Any other points you wanna make, Jesse?
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:45.680]  I don't think so.
[02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:46.581]  I think I'm good.
[02:11:47.001 --> 02:11:47.782]  Well, you've said it all.
[02:11:47.802 --> 02:11:49.023]  We're gonna go celebrate this weekend.
[02:11:49.915 --> 02:11:51.217]  Making America great again.
[02:11:51.277 --> 02:11:51.818]  Steak dinner.
[02:11:51.979 --> 02:11:53.321]  You keep talking about these steak dinners.
[02:11:53.381 --> 02:11:53.661]  I'm ready.
[02:11:53.702 --> 02:11:55.204]  We gotta go to that place out off 71.
[02:11:56.166 --> 02:11:56.326]  Yep.
[02:11:57.328 --> 02:11:58.630]  Every time you're like, let's go.
[02:11:58.830 --> 02:11:59.551]  I gotta do something else.
[02:12:00.100 --> 02:12:02.482]  We can't go by ourselves, we gotta take the girls.
[02:12:03.222 --> 02:12:04.563]  Yeah, let's take everybody.
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:33.461]  Uh, I just bought an ammunition company.
[02:12:33.881 --> 02:12:36.842]  Me and a partner in Payson, Arizona.
[02:12:37.382 --> 02:12:38.362]  That is so American.
[02:12:38.602 --> 02:12:38.882]  Yeah.
[02:12:39.122 --> 02:12:39.622]  Guns and ammo.
[02:12:39.642 --> 02:12:40.602]  That's not so manly.
[02:12:40.622 --> 02:12:42.423]  I need an ammo company myself.
[02:12:42.443 --> 02:12:45.264]  You have to have armaments companies to be a man, right?
[02:12:45.284 --> 02:12:46.244]  Alright, I'm going to go home.
[02:12:46.304 --> 02:12:46.864]  I'm tired.
[02:12:46.884 --> 02:12:48.084]  JJFU.com.
[02:12:48.704 --> 02:12:50.145]  Alright, let's go to Uncle Ted.
[02:12:50.165 --> 02:12:50.485]  Here it is.
[02:12:50.545 --> 02:12:51.105]  Thanks, Jesse.
[02:12:51.525 --> 02:12:52.145]  Thanks, man.
[02:13:45.707 --> 02:13:55.531]  This is real Michigan, huh?
[02:13:55.631 --> 02:14:05.735]  It's good to see real Michigan get together to take Michigan back so we can take America back.
[02:14:11.687 --> 02:14:20.414]  Is this enough real Michigan to take Michigan out of the blue and into the red for Donald Trump?
[02:14:23.977 --> 02:14:31.323]  Are there enough real Michiganiacs, real Michigan deer hunters in Fred Behr country
[02:14:33.889 --> 02:14:35.972]  In the winter water wonderland.
[02:14:35.992 --> 02:14:41.338]  To stand up for what we believe in.
[02:15:09.292 --> 02:15:09.373]  Yeah.
[02:15:58.556 --> 02:16:07.101]  I'm stuck in the middle of the night.
[02:16:07.301 --> 02:16:19.949]  I'm stuck in the middle of the night.
[02:16:28.997 --> 02:16:29.858]  I'm good.
[02:16:55.947 --> 02:16:58.270]  I think so.
[02:17:31.292 --> 02:17:31.832]  Yeah.
[02:18:25.653 --> 02:18:26.695]  USA!
[02:18:27.076 --> 02:18:28.037]  USA!
[02:18:31.542 --> 02:18:34.626]  Is it a way to come into a broadcast?
[02:18:34.646 --> 02:18:35.868]  I don't know what is.
[02:18:37.540 --> 02:18:42.826]  This is the InfoWars special election coverage, 52-hour edition.
[02:18:42.986 --> 02:18:45.189]  Alex Jones just signs off with Jesse James.
[02:18:45.669 --> 02:18:49.474]  They finish with a beautiful rendition of the National Anthem.
[02:18:49.694 --> 02:18:51.736]  I've got a ton of stuff to cover tonight.
[02:18:51.776 --> 02:18:54.459]  We're still going to be live for at least four more hours tonight.
[02:18:54.900 --> 02:18:57.843]  We've got some news we're going to cover here at the top of this hour.
[02:18:58.784 --> 02:19:02.709]  We've got some videos we're going to play, some Trump ads that we haven't shared with you yet.
[02:19:03.249 --> 02:19:07.053]  I'm going to play my run-in with the female version of Age Skrillex.
[02:19:07.113 --> 02:19:09.276]  Break that down for you, go through my experience that night.
[02:19:09.656 --> 02:19:11.979]  And then at 11 o'clock we're going to start rolling with the guests.
[02:19:11.999 --> 02:19:14.161]  We're going to have Jack Posobiec joining us at 11.
[02:19:14.682 --> 02:19:16.684]  He's going to be followed up by Elizabeth Imus at 11.30.
[02:19:17.865 --> 02:19:18.905]  And then author T.S.
[02:19:18.965 --> 02:19:21.686]  Pettibone, Nicole and Brittany Pettibone will be joining us after that.
[02:19:21.706 --> 02:19:27.428]  We're going to really dive into WikiLeaks, everything they've discovered, we've discovered on that front.
[02:19:27.528 --> 02:19:32.369]  And we'll also have phone lines open for you as long as we're here, all night long.
[02:19:32.409 --> 02:19:35.550]  That could be up till even past 2 a.m.
[02:19:35.590 --> 02:19:36.330]  Central Time here.
[02:19:36.370 --> 02:19:37.370]  That number is 1-877-789-ALEX.
[02:19:37.390 --> 02:19:37.550]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[02:19:37.570 --> 02:19:37.950]  Owen Schroer.
[02:19:43.672 --> 02:19:45.753]  Hosting the rest of the live edition for tonight.
[02:19:45.813 --> 02:19:48.415]  I'm joined right now by Darren McBreen.
[02:19:48.455 --> 02:19:52.338]  He came in here, he said he had some breaking news that just came across his desk.
[02:19:52.378 --> 02:19:54.839]  He wanted to get it out with you, share it with me as well.
[02:19:55.240 --> 02:19:55.980]  Darren, what do you got?
[02:19:56.601 --> 02:19:57.661]  The Russians are coming.
[02:19:58.362 --> 02:20:08.288]  This is the top of drudge right now, and we've been worried about this for some time, but the top of drudge, and also NBC, Lester Holt is making a big deal out of this this evening.
[02:20:08.909 --> 02:20:13.172]  All hands on deck to protect election from hack.
[02:20:13.852 --> 02:20:25.845]  So, the federal government is here to help, and they are on high alert right now in case the Russians launch a cyber attack to throw the election in favor of Donald Trump.
[02:20:26.506 --> 02:20:31.452]  So, and they are so concerned that intelligence officials told NBC that there are literally
[02:20:31.992 --> 02:20:44.040]  Hundreds of military intelligence cyber experts that are working out of top-secret facilities and underground bunkers in case the Russians launch a cyber attack.
[02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:48.943]  And don't forget, Owen, it was Obama just a few months ago who said that the U.S.
[02:20:49.144 --> 02:20:54.107]  is preparing for a retaliation in case cyber attack from Russia.
[02:20:54.407 --> 02:21:01.512]  Hillary Clinton said during her campaign that as president she would respond to a Russian hack attack with military force.
[02:21:02.052 --> 02:21:07.255]  So, this to me is, I think this is a potential threat of a false flag.
[02:21:07.936 --> 02:21:18.022]  If Trump, if they see Trump really taking this thing and he's way ahead in the lead tomorrow, who knows what these guys will do to stop Trump from becoming president.
[02:21:18.482 --> 02:21:21.183]  So, let's actually look at the logic here.
[02:21:21.243 --> 02:21:30.109]  Okay, so first, it's Obama, you know, election fraud doesn't exist, I don't know what a rigged election is, doesn't happen, it doesn't happen, but the Russians are doing it!
[02:21:30.689 --> 02:21:35.291]  So election fraud doesn't exist, but it's the Russians that are interfering with the election.
[02:21:35.311 --> 02:21:38.552]  And then you take it to another level, as Darren just said.
[02:21:38.572 --> 02:21:44.295]  Okay, so we're preparing for, I guess it's an imminent cyber attack from Russia.
[02:21:44.335 --> 02:21:45.395]  That's how they're treating this.
[02:21:45.815 --> 02:21:49.157]  And as Darren just said, that means World War III, folks!
[02:21:50.057 --> 02:21:55.019]  Hillary Clinton has said she will respond physically to a cyber attack.
[02:21:55.499 --> 02:22:01.061]  So they're here greasing the skids for a Russian cyber attack false flag.
[02:22:01.781 --> 02:22:06.443]  And then they've already said they'll have a physical attack over a cyber attack.
[02:22:06.763 --> 02:22:11.485]  And then I'm gonna get attacked by social justice warriors for supporting Donald Trump.
[02:22:12.225 --> 02:22:16.326]  Because they say he's pro-war, and Hillary Clinton is the peace candidate.
[02:22:16.426 --> 02:22:21.428]  I mean, it is a truly bass-ackwards world that I'm living in.
[02:22:21.568 --> 02:22:22.168]  I don't know, Darren.
[02:22:22.288 --> 02:22:23.809]  I don't... We've heard from Russians.
[02:22:23.849 --> 02:22:26.670]  Actually, we're going to play clips from Russia later on in the broadcast tonight.
[02:22:26.690 --> 02:22:30.031]  We've got a bunch of clips from Russia that we're going to air here, translated in English.
[02:22:31.311 --> 02:22:41.255]  If you believe what's coming out of the Russian camp, if you take both of these government entities at their word, Russia says they're not interfering, the United States is saying they're interfering, one of them's lying.
[02:22:42.096 --> 02:22:44.057]  Well, the Russians aren't screwing around either.
[02:22:44.077 --> 02:22:47.860]  I mean, they are not going to take a cyber attack against them lightly.
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:52.403]  OK, so this is a dangerous, dangerous game that they're playing right now.
[02:22:52.944 --> 02:22:59.449]  So and like I said, the establishment, they will stop at nothing to make sure that Donald Trump doesn't get in there.
[02:22:59.489 --> 02:23:04.092]  So I wouldn't be surprised if they would risk a major conflict with Russia.
[02:23:04.392 --> 02:23:20.296]  If they would risk World War III, and all they have to do, and of course they got the media on their side to say, hey man, the Russians did it, they're screwing with our elections, we gotta stop everything right now and figure this out, and then launch a massive, what they will call a counterattack against the Russians.
[02:23:20.617 --> 02:23:21.577]  Very, very dangerous.
[02:23:21.737 --> 02:23:25.338]  And not only do they have, obviously, the media in collusion, but the White House as well.
[02:23:25.378 --> 02:23:32.460]  This is Obama's White House, Biden's White House, they want Hillary in, and you mentioned the risk, Darren, here's the risk that these people are facing, okay?
[02:23:33.320 --> 02:23:37.301]  They're going to lose control of this country if Donald Trump becomes president, folks.
[02:23:37.761 --> 02:23:42.842]  No matter what you think about Donald Trump, that is where the rubber meets the road.
[02:23:42.902 --> 02:23:45.303]  They know if Trump gets in, that means they lose power.
[02:23:45.643 --> 02:23:51.024]  That's why they're throwing everything against the wall right now to try to stop Trump from getting in.
[02:23:51.324 --> 02:23:57.406]  And then, as you've clearly pointed out here, they're going to grease the skids for a false flag in case Donald Trump gets in.
[02:23:58.146 --> 02:23:59.287]  Who knows what they might pull.
[02:23:59.347 --> 02:24:01.128]  Maybe they try to keep Obama in office.
[02:24:01.568 --> 02:24:04.730]  Maybe they try to launch World War III.
[02:24:05.330 --> 02:24:09.072]  Maybe Trump wins and riots happen because of George Soros movements.
[02:24:09.153 --> 02:24:10.513]  That's kind of what I think is going to happen.
[02:24:10.894 --> 02:24:11.614]  But it is interesting.
[02:24:11.654 --> 02:24:12.955]  We've seen this in the history, Darren.
[02:24:13.275 --> 02:24:14.976]  They start prepping for these things.
[02:24:14.996 --> 02:24:16.577]  They start planning for these things.
[02:24:16.857 --> 02:24:18.298]  They get the media behind them.
[02:24:18.678 --> 02:24:21.780]  We know what the risk is if they don't win this election.
[02:24:22.260 --> 02:24:24.882]  So that's why I think they're willing to do anything
[02:24:25.783 --> 02:24:31.627]  Anything to try to get their candidate in and really this is just the beginning of our fight.
[02:24:32.187 --> 02:24:40.313]  I absolutely agree and by the way Kit Daniels has a report right now that's on Infowars.com and this is breaking as well.
[02:24:40.753 --> 02:24:49.498]  Trump is pulling away and Hillary is desperate for votes in the blue states so early indications have Donald Trump pulling way ahead right now.
[02:24:50.719 --> 02:24:58.883]  And inside sources say internet polls by the Democrats show that Trump is way ahead in the swing state.
[02:24:58.963 --> 02:25:07.927]  So the only possible way for Hillary to win right now is through massive voter fraud or cyber attack that might launch a false flag.
[02:25:07.967 --> 02:25:08.707]  That's the only way, man.
[02:25:09.944 --> 02:25:13.928]  And why don't people, why do people put all this blind trust in electronic voting?
[02:25:13.948 --> 02:25:16.470]  I mean, and I was thinking about this the other night too, Darren.
[02:25:17.051 --> 02:25:22.236]  So we, first of all, we click a button on an electronic machine and then we're supposed to trust the algorithm.
[02:25:22.356 --> 02:25:23.217]  We don't know the algorithm.
[02:25:23.257 --> 02:25:25.599]  I was very uncomfortable with it because I voted already.
[02:25:25.639 --> 02:25:26.940]  I voted last Friday.
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:28.942]  It was all, it was an electronic voting machine.
[02:25:29.102 --> 02:25:30.223]  I voted absentee ballots.
[02:25:30.243 --> 02:25:32.585]  People are reporting apparently people are ripping up absentee ballots.
[02:25:32.605 --> 02:25:33.926]  I'm not going to buy that report.
[02:25:33.946 --> 02:25:35.087]  I'm going to hope people are better than that.
[02:25:35.447 --> 02:25:37.669]  But again, you push a button on an electronic machine.
[02:25:37.709 --> 02:25:38.490]  I don't know the algorithm.
[02:25:38.510 --> 02:25:39.651]  They don't release these algorithms.
[02:25:39.991 --> 02:25:41.693]  I don't know how this thing is tabulated.
[02:25:41.913 --> 02:25:48.959]  We know how they tabulate it in the final tabulation process and it's not actually a count of votes, but a fractional count of a percentage of votes.
[02:25:49.359 --> 02:25:51.041]  So then there's that kind of rigging going on.
[02:25:51.661 --> 02:26:10.295]  I mean, it's really just crazy, and I'm sitting here thinking, okay, so not only am I pushing a button, and then that's how I cast my vote, I don't really see it get cast, nobody's actually counting it, it's just I have to trust this machine, it's black box voting, then I took it to another level, Darren, because I'm thinking this, we're going to be on the air for 52 hours here, right?
[02:26:10.315 --> 02:26:18.281]  We're going to be on the air when they announce who won this election, and then I'm sitting here thinking, okay, well what are we doing?
[02:26:18.301 --> 02:26:18.802]  What am I doing?
[02:26:19.739 --> 02:26:21.840]  I'm listening to the mainstream news!
[02:26:22.180 --> 02:26:28.783]  So now I also have to trust the mainstream news to actually report the actual results, and it got me thinking.
[02:26:29.983 --> 02:26:31.624]  This has to be totally localized, folks.
[02:26:31.684 --> 02:26:32.464]  It's the answer to everything.
[02:26:32.504 --> 02:26:33.444]  It's the answer to the schools.
[02:26:33.504 --> 02:26:34.665]  It's the answer to your cops.
[02:26:34.945 --> 02:26:35.885]  It's the answer to the elections.
[02:26:36.305 --> 02:26:37.806]  Localize everything.
[02:26:37.886 --> 02:26:38.506]  Localize everything.
[02:26:38.526 --> 02:26:40.847]  It requires a little more effort on your part, but guess what?
[02:26:40.867 --> 02:26:44.729]  The effort is worth it, because that's what it takes to be America.
[02:26:44.789 --> 02:26:45.309]  Darren McBreen.
[02:26:45.529 --> 02:26:47.250]  But there's also social media.
[02:26:47.510 --> 02:26:53.052]  And you can rely on social media for the most part if you tune into InfoWars, Breitbart, the Drudge Report.
[02:26:53.412 --> 02:26:58.254]  There will be reports of voter fraud, election fraud, so we will definitely stay on top of that.
[02:26:58.634 --> 02:27:00.795]  And that's why we're going to stay live for so long.
[02:27:01.095 --> 02:27:02.436]  We're definitely going to stay on top of that.
[02:27:02.856 --> 02:27:04.437]  But where's the federal government right now?
[02:27:04.757 --> 02:27:08.700]  Why aren't they looking out for the electronic voting systems that might be rigged?
[02:27:09.021 --> 02:27:12.403]  Why aren't they looking for illegal aliens that might be voting?
[02:27:12.783 --> 02:27:17.206]  Why aren't they looking for, you know, there's all kinds of voter fraud nationwide.
[02:27:17.247 --> 02:27:25.633]  We've heard reports in early voting, even here in Texas, where somehow these votes for Trump are somehow flipping to Hillary Clinton.
[02:27:25.973 --> 02:27:27.274]  Where's the federal government there?
[02:27:27.614 --> 02:27:31.799]  No, they're in underground bunkers preparing for a Russian cyber attack.
[02:27:32.500 --> 02:27:34.963]  So that's what's going on.
[02:27:35.183 --> 02:27:37.726]  It's truly crazy and I agree.
[02:27:37.926 --> 02:27:39.588]  I don't see how Trump doesn't win at a landslide.
[02:27:39.668 --> 02:27:40.749]  I look at voter turnout.
[02:27:40.829 --> 02:27:42.411]  I look at what's happening on social media.
[02:27:44.193 --> 02:27:45.375]  We know how they rig these things.
[02:27:45.395 --> 02:27:47.357]  We know what happens with the electronic voting machines.
[02:27:48.159 --> 02:27:50.301]  We've seen the video proof of votes being switched.
[02:27:50.341 --> 02:27:51.303]  It happened in the primaries.
[02:27:51.323 --> 02:27:51.823]  But you're right.
[02:27:51.864 --> 02:27:54.307]  We are going to have Americans out there watching these polls.
[02:27:55.048 --> 02:27:58.152]  And we have the Wear Red movement tomorrow.
[02:27:58.172 --> 02:28:00.435]  We're going to wear red on Election Day, folks.
[02:28:00.455 --> 02:28:01.497]  This is how we're going to curb
[02:28:01.977 --> 02:28:02.678]  Voter fraud.
[02:28:02.798 --> 02:28:17.252]  If we're all wearing red at the polls, if it's clearly a sea of red when you go to vote, they cannot steal this without blatantly lying to the American public, which of course they have been for years, but we hope that the optics will be so strong that the public will be able to wake up.
[02:28:17.312 --> 02:28:19.274]  So now everybody's starting to figure it out.
[02:28:19.354 --> 02:28:20.876]  So all aboard the Trump train.
[02:28:20.916 --> 02:28:21.817]  Wear red tomorrow.
[02:28:21.857 --> 02:28:22.938]  Let's see a sea of red.
[02:28:23.298 --> 02:28:24.379]  So here's the deal, folks.
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:31.065]  If Donald Trump wins, we've got a bunch of celebrities who think that they're gonna go ahead and leave this country!
[02:28:31.645 --> 02:28:33.907]  They're so appalled by Donald Trump!
[02:28:33.927 --> 02:28:35.988]  They can't stand Donald Trump!
[02:28:36.168 --> 02:28:37.129]  Oh my God!
[02:28:37.570 --> 02:28:39.091]  I gotta leave this country!
[02:28:39.111 --> 02:28:40.111]  It's so bad here!
[02:28:40.151 --> 02:28:41.713]  Colin Kaepernick takes a knee!
[02:28:41.753 --> 02:28:42.653]  The oppression!
[02:28:43.354 --> 02:28:43.474]  Oh!
[02:28:43.874 --> 02:28:44.595]  Let me guess though.
[02:28:44.775 --> 02:28:46.877]  They're not going to Mexico.
[02:28:46.897 --> 02:28:49.358]  One is going to Mexico.
[02:28:49.518 --> 02:28:50.279]  One of the celebrities.
[02:28:50.299 --> 02:28:51.900]  We've got a list here of 23 celebrities.
[02:28:51.940 --> 02:28:52.541]  They're, of course,
[02:28:55.222 --> 02:28:56.783]  You want to talk about deplorable?
[02:28:57.623 --> 02:28:59.745]  Amy Schumer is deplorable, okay?
[02:28:59.865 --> 02:29:00.485]  I'm sorry.
[02:29:00.745 --> 02:29:03.767]  This woman is disgusting, okay?
[02:29:04.107 --> 02:29:07.429]  She's never met a buffet that she didn't enjoy.
[02:29:07.829 --> 02:29:09.130]  But that's none of my business.
[02:29:09.510 --> 02:29:12.572]  So we've actually had some, uh, we've got some great graphics people.
[02:29:12.612 --> 02:29:15.834]  Darren is actually one of them in studio with me right now who went ahead...
[02:29:16.554 --> 02:29:18.776]  They went ahead and they made up some great graphics.
[02:29:19.216 --> 02:29:25.900]  So let's go ahead, let's go down this list of all these famous celebrities who are trying to make... See, this is what this is all about, folks.
[02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:27.341]  This is a PSYOP, okay?
[02:29:27.742 --> 02:29:44.693]  They get you to buy into these celebrities with the lightbox, with the flashing lights on the television, so that you take everything they say as gospel, everything they say you praise, that's your reality, and then these people come out here and they try to skew the reality so bad that they want to trick you.
[02:29:44.713 --> 02:29:46.014]  They want to steal your vote, folks.
[02:29:46.554 --> 02:29:52.416]  They want to steal, these people are, you know, this is what got me so ticked off when I started in the information war.
[02:29:52.436 --> 02:29:56.957]  When you realize that these people are trying to steal your reality, okay?
[02:29:57.317 --> 02:30:12.221]  When you realize that these celebrities I'm about to mention, I mean, look, maybe half of them are just clueless, maybe half of them are just having a good time, but people like Amy Schumer, they know exactly the PSYOP they're operating, and they are trying to take, they're literally just using you.
[02:30:13.112 --> 02:30:13.612]  As a vote.
[02:30:13.752 --> 02:30:14.133]  That's it.
[02:30:14.153 --> 02:30:16.074]  They don't actually care about your future.
[02:30:16.294 --> 02:30:21.037]  It's not working like it used to because did you hear what happened with Bud Light?
[02:30:21.337 --> 02:30:23.218]  Amy Schumer and Seth Rogen.
[02:30:23.238 --> 02:30:23.558]  Gone.
[02:30:23.959 --> 02:30:30.763]  They did a Bud Light commercial and then the executives at Bud Light, they're wondering why their sales are dropping so bad.
[02:30:31.483 --> 02:30:32.504]  And they figured it out.
[02:30:32.524 --> 02:30:36.347]  Because you put a fat pig on your campaign ads!
[02:30:36.968 --> 02:30:37.428]  Look at that!
[02:30:37.448 --> 02:30:38.869]  That woman is disgusting!
[02:30:38.949 --> 02:30:39.490]  I'm sorry.
[02:30:39.670 --> 02:30:42.993]  And they're known liberals and the public wasn't responding to it.
[02:30:43.013 --> 02:30:46.516]  So Bud Light sales were tanking and they had to pull the ads.
[02:30:46.556 --> 02:30:47.216]  So look, it's a...
[02:30:48.177 --> 02:30:49.358]  Consumer-driven market?
[02:30:49.638 --> 02:30:51.200]  That's a good force right there.
[02:30:51.420 --> 02:30:52.060]  Amen to that.
[02:30:52.140 --> 02:30:55.143]  And that is, I mean, your ultimate vote is your dollar, folks.
[02:30:55.183 --> 02:30:57.825]  You quit putting money into these people's pockets.
[02:30:58.085 --> 02:30:59.006]  Or at least that's what we believe.
[02:30:59.046 --> 02:31:00.267]  Who knows, the Federal Reserve could print some money.
[02:31:00.287 --> 02:31:04.070]  And if you don't like what Robert De Niro says about Donald Trump, don't buy his freaking movies.
[02:31:04.110 --> 02:31:04.611]  Don't rent them.
[02:31:04.811 --> 02:31:06.953]  Stop going to the movies to see De Niro.
[02:31:07.313 --> 02:31:10.058]  Alright guys, so let's go ahead and start rolling these graphics.
[02:31:10.098 --> 02:31:14.805]  These are the celebrities that are going to leave the country if Donald Trump wins.
[02:31:15.326 --> 02:31:19.954]  More reason to vote Donald Trump, to be perfectly honest with you, for some of these people.
[02:31:19.974 --> 02:31:21.396]  You guys got those graphics ready to go?
[02:31:24.011 --> 02:31:25.532]  So we are going to start here.
[02:31:25.552 --> 02:31:26.012]  There he is.
[02:31:26.072 --> 02:31:27.773]  There is Jon Stewart.
[02:31:28.354 --> 02:31:29.394]  Jon Stewart, folks.
[02:31:29.735 --> 02:31:33.637]  He has said he's going to move to another planet.
[02:31:33.677 --> 02:31:36.859]  So for Jon Stewart, it's Hillary or death.
[02:31:37.699 --> 02:31:40.281]  Give me Hillary or give me death.
[02:31:40.901 --> 02:31:43.803]  That is the credo of Jon Stewart.
[02:31:43.823 --> 02:31:44.744]  Good luck with that, Jon.
[02:31:44.904 --> 02:31:47.525]  I don't know of any planets right now that can sustain human life.
[02:31:47.805 --> 02:31:49.727]  How long do you think you'd live on that planet, Jon?
[02:31:49.867 --> 02:31:53.129]  I think Jon is already on a different planet, to be perfectly honest with you, Darren.
[02:31:54.250 --> 02:31:59.634]  If he thinks he's gonna have a give me Hillary or give me death slogan heading in.
[02:31:59.694 --> 02:32:00.375]  Yeah, see ya.
[02:32:00.535 --> 02:32:01.796]  We'll be sure NASA ships you off.
[02:32:01.816 --> 02:32:05.099]  Alright, so we also got Chelsea Handler.
[02:32:05.919 --> 02:32:08.021]  Oh boy, she's such an intellectual, folks.
[02:32:08.061 --> 02:32:11.684]  I mean, she has done so much great things for herself.
[02:32:12.045 --> 02:32:14.066]  She said she's gonna move to Spain.
[02:32:15.007 --> 02:32:17.950]  You know, good luck with your show in Spain.
[02:32:18.190 --> 02:32:19.551]  I doubt it takes off.
[02:32:19.591 --> 02:32:21.372]  In fact, I doubt you even move.
[02:32:22.153 --> 02:32:23.734]  You know, here's what probably happened.
[02:32:24.014 --> 02:32:27.035]  She was probably told by her handlers that Hillary would win.
[02:32:27.055 --> 02:32:32.536]  A lot of these people were probably told by their handlers, Chelsea Handler, she has handlers, that Hillary was going to win.
[02:32:33.177 --> 02:32:36.418]  So they just, it's like, oh, don't worry, you know, you're not going to look like an idiot.
[02:32:36.498 --> 02:32:38.898]  You're not going to look like a dumbass when you say these statements.
[02:32:38.918 --> 02:32:39.799]  You know, Hillary's going to win.
[02:32:39.819 --> 02:32:40.499]  We got it locked up.
[02:32:40.959 --> 02:32:44.662]  But no, you will look like a dumbass, Chelsea Handler, and you already do.
[02:32:44.682 --> 02:32:47.323]  But, you know, good luck moving to Spain.
[02:32:47.403 --> 02:32:53.167]  I doubt you speak Spanish, and I doubt any television networks in Spain want to pick up your rotten TV show.
[02:32:53.547 --> 02:33:01.132]  Now, Nev Campbell, this is actually, I'm not even sure if I knew who this was, but nonetheless, she wants to move to Canada.
[02:33:01.212 --> 02:33:02.733]  Her reason is pretty weird.
[02:33:02.813 --> 02:33:05.775]  She says his honesty is terrifying.
[02:33:06.676 --> 02:33:10.279]  I mean, I guess a drastic change to people is terrifying.
[02:33:10.299 --> 02:33:12.380]  I guess the honesty... They like being lied to.
[02:33:12.820 --> 02:33:15.843]  I guess, yeah, I mean, I guess some Americans like being lied to, too.
[02:33:15.883 --> 02:33:17.284]  Apparently they voted Obama in again.
[02:33:18.322 --> 02:33:18.722]  Got a point.
[02:33:18.863 --> 02:33:19.603]  Bush in twice?
[02:33:20.524 --> 02:33:21.285]  Clinton in twice?
[02:33:21.305 --> 02:33:21.985]  Yeah.
[02:33:22.266 --> 02:33:24.027]  I guess I could just go down the list here.
[02:33:24.047 --> 02:33:24.588]  We've been on a roll.
[02:33:24.608 --> 02:33:28.091]  Like I said, this is the last chance to make America great again.
[02:33:28.151 --> 02:33:30.614]  This is really our last chance to save the republic.
[02:33:30.774 --> 02:33:32.015]  So, uh, Donald Trump in there.
[02:33:32.075 --> 02:33:35.839]  So, Neve Campbell though, um, she's scared of change.
[02:33:36.199 --> 02:33:37.160]  I think that that's what that is.
[02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:38.361]  She's scared of the truth.
[02:33:38.441 --> 02:33:40.983]  Most, you know what, most social justice warriors are afraid of the truth.
[02:33:41.644 --> 02:33:43.305]  Alright, so she's going to go ahead and go to Canada.
[02:33:43.425 --> 02:33:44.446]  Good luck in Canada.
[02:33:44.466 --> 02:33:46.487]  Alright, now Barry Diller.
[02:33:46.908 --> 02:33:48.989]  This is an interesting one from Barry Diller.
[02:33:49.029 --> 02:33:53.912]  He said he doesn't know where he's going to go, but he's either going to move out of the country or join the resistance.
[02:33:54.092 --> 02:33:54.833]  Well, wait a second.
[02:33:55.433 --> 02:33:56.554]  Join the resistance?
[02:33:56.874 --> 02:33:57.775]  The resistance.
[02:33:58.435 --> 02:33:59.476]  We are the resistance.
[02:33:59.976 --> 02:34:00.817]  Is he going to join us?
[02:34:01.918 --> 02:34:03.038]  It doesn't sound like it.
[02:34:03.999 --> 02:34:04.540]  I don't know, man.
[02:34:04.740 --> 02:34:06.141]  Is he going to join the Trump movement now?
[02:34:06.161 --> 02:34:07.442]  He said he's going to join the resistance.
[02:34:07.462 --> 02:34:08.283]  That's the Trump movement.
[02:34:08.904 --> 02:34:09.965]  Barry Diller, you know what?
[02:34:10.485 --> 02:34:12.427]  I think his whole mind is a little unspecified.
[02:34:12.467 --> 02:34:13.688]  I'm not sure if he knows what he's talking about.
[02:34:14.169 --> 02:34:16.491]  Lena Dunham, she's also going to move to Canada.
[02:34:17.432 --> 02:34:19.273]  Now, it's been tough.
[02:34:21.195 --> 02:34:22.956]  It's been tough for Lena Dunham, you know.
[02:34:23.276 --> 02:34:25.397]  She's really going to move, though.
[02:34:25.737 --> 02:34:30.060]  That's what she wants to make it clear, that she is really going to move.
[02:34:30.220 --> 02:34:31.521]  But you know what's funny about this to me, Darren?
[02:34:31.561 --> 02:34:35.483]  I don't know about your experience, but all the Canadians I talk to love Donald Trump.
[02:34:35.904 --> 02:34:36.724]  They want Donald Trump.
[02:34:37.084 --> 02:34:37.685]  They want him elected.
[02:34:38.345 --> 02:34:39.286]  Is that what you've seen?
[02:34:39.626 --> 02:34:40.547]  Yeah, I mean, I've seen that.
[02:34:40.587 --> 02:34:44.890]  Well, even people from Mexico, and especially people in the Latinos on the border towns.
[02:34:45.531 --> 02:34:46.751]  Absolutely for Donald Trump.
[02:34:47.312 --> 02:34:48.733]  Well, I mean, who doesn't want to border?
[02:34:48.773 --> 02:34:51.975]  It's what makes a country, but I don't know, that's just common sense.
[02:34:52.976 --> 02:34:55.798]  Keegan Key, you may recognize him, another comedian.
[02:34:55.818 --> 02:34:58.520]  These are high-class intellectuals, folks.
[02:34:59.454 --> 02:35:01.175]  He is also going to move to Canada.
[02:35:01.495 --> 02:35:05.178]  And then he even admits it's basically like no different than America.
[02:35:05.238 --> 02:35:06.179]  All these people that want to live there.
[02:35:06.199 --> 02:35:08.580]  You want to move to Canada, it's like you could toss a rock and go to Canada.
[02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:09.741]  Why not just go now?
[02:35:10.662 --> 02:35:11.202]  Just go ahead!
[02:35:12.082 --> 02:35:12.743]  There's no border.
[02:35:12.763 --> 02:35:13.864]  You can just walk right over.
[02:35:13.884 --> 02:35:18.447]  You know, I mean, it's not that much of a difference according to Keegan Key.
[02:35:18.487 --> 02:35:20.028]  So, you know, just go ahead.
[02:35:20.068 --> 02:35:20.708]  Go over there now.
[02:35:20.788 --> 02:35:21.489]  Nobody's stopping you.
[02:35:22.169 --> 02:35:23.870]  Then we've got Chloe Sevigny.
[02:35:23.970 --> 02:35:24.951]  I don't know if I'm saying that right.
[02:35:24.971 --> 02:35:25.612]  I really don't care.
[02:35:25.952 --> 02:35:27.253]  She's moving to Nova Scotia.
[02:35:28.197 --> 02:35:32.058]  Yeah, because there's all those major studio production companies over there.
[02:35:32.618 --> 02:35:35.299]  Yeah, I'm sure you're going to move to Nova Scotia.
[02:35:35.359 --> 02:35:37.440]  This is a big Hollywood movement right now.
[02:35:37.620 --> 02:35:39.420]  There was a handful just a few months ago.
[02:35:39.440 --> 02:35:40.881]  Were they going to start a new Hollywood?
[02:35:41.021 --> 02:35:41.141]  Maybe.
[02:35:41.161 --> 02:35:43.961]  Maybe a new Hollywood in Spain.
[02:35:44.442 --> 02:35:45.182]  I don't know.
[02:35:45.382 --> 02:35:48.583]  Is there a major movie production and TV production out there, guys?
[02:35:48.663 --> 02:35:49.123]  I don't think so.
[02:35:49.143 --> 02:35:49.963]  They're not going anywhere.
[02:35:50.003 --> 02:35:50.643]  Of course they're not going.
[02:35:50.663 --> 02:35:52.544]  They're going to get a vacation home out there.
[02:35:52.564 --> 02:35:53.124]  Go ahead.
[02:35:55.705 --> 02:35:56.125]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:35:58.254 --> 02:36:00.416]  Canada invented the movies, folks.
[02:36:01.216 --> 02:36:02.477]  They also faked the moon landing.
[02:36:02.517 --> 02:36:04.279]  No, okay, so she's going to Nova Scotia.
[02:36:04.299 --> 02:36:10.664]  Alright, now this next one, this might be the best reason, this might be the best endorsement Donald Trump has gotten.
[02:36:11.505 --> 02:36:14.607]  Al Sharpton is going to move.
[02:36:14.867 --> 02:36:15.568]  He's outta here!
[02:36:15.928 --> 02:36:16.589]  He doesn't even care!
[02:36:16.689 --> 02:36:17.870]  He's outta here, folks!
[02:36:18.290 --> 02:36:19.411]  He is... Go!
[02:36:19.891 --> 02:36:20.812]  Just go!
[02:36:20.832 --> 02:36:21.613]  Okay?
[02:36:21.893 --> 02:36:25.156]  Take your tax-evading ass and get the hell outta here!
[02:36:25.376 --> 02:36:28.399]  Take your race-baiting ass and get the hell outta here!
[02:36:28.719 --> 02:36:30.260]  I mean... Go!
[02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:34.364]  Like, seriously, have you ever seen this guy, Darren, when he tries to read the teleprompter and fails?
[02:36:34.384 --> 02:36:35.024]  Have you ever seen this?
[02:36:35.485 --> 02:36:38.888]  I've seen him pretty much regurgitate everything Obama says.
[02:36:39.348 --> 02:36:40.109]  He's pretty bad, huh?
[02:36:40.686 --> 02:36:41.086]  I don't know.
[02:36:41.106 --> 02:36:42.427]  He can't even read a teleprompter?
[02:36:43.408 --> 02:36:45.069]  Honestly, folks, maybe we'll do this later.
[02:36:45.089 --> 02:36:46.670]  It's one of the funniest things you'll ever see.
[02:36:47.470 --> 02:36:49.371]  Al Sharpton versus the teleprompter.
[02:36:49.431 --> 02:36:50.912]  There's like six of these now.
[02:36:51.012 --> 02:36:53.173]  I think it was the Washington Free Beacon that makes these.
[02:36:54.454 --> 02:36:56.015]  I mean, seriously, the guy can't even read.
[02:36:56.075 --> 02:36:56.956]  The guy is illiterate.
[02:36:57.216 --> 02:36:58.056]  I'm not making this up.
[02:36:58.296 --> 02:37:00.498]  This guy is one of the most hated people in America.
[02:37:00.578 --> 02:37:07.122]  And even in Ferguson, you know, Jesse Jackson showed up in Ferguson and everybody was throwing rocks at him and yelling at him, telling him to get the hell out of there.
[02:37:07.642 --> 02:37:08.082]  You know what?
[02:37:08.122 --> 02:37:08.643]  Here's the thing.
[02:37:09.483 --> 02:37:11.044]  Of course Al Sharpton wants to get out of here.
[02:37:11.064 --> 02:37:13.544]  This guy owes millions of dollars in taxes.
[02:37:13.844 --> 02:37:15.825]  Trump's probably going to get in and lock his ass up!
[02:37:16.745 --> 02:37:17.666]  So there you go, Al.
[02:37:17.686 --> 02:37:18.386]  No wonder he wouldn't leave.
[02:37:18.506 --> 02:37:19.286]  He'll be a fugitive.
[02:37:20.187 --> 02:37:24.288]  Natasha Lyonne, she wants to go to a mental hospital.
[02:37:25.068 --> 02:37:28.549]  Now I might make the case that that's already where she belongs.
[02:37:29.430 --> 02:37:33.391]  So, you know, maybe Trump gets in, she goes where she belongs, the mental hospital.
[02:37:33.791 --> 02:37:34.451]  But here's the thing.
[02:37:35.372 --> 02:37:36.392]  She's a Hillary supporter.
[02:37:37.403 --> 02:37:39.384]  They all belong in a mental hospital.
[02:37:39.404 --> 02:37:41.085]  That's the thing.
[02:37:41.165 --> 02:37:42.805]  Liberalism is a mental disorder.
[02:37:42.825 --> 02:37:44.546]  They're sitting here scratching their heads.
[02:37:44.586 --> 02:37:45.327]  She says it right there.
[02:37:45.527 --> 02:37:46.567]  How is this happening?
[02:37:46.627 --> 02:37:47.768]  How is this going on?
[02:37:47.788 --> 02:37:51.129]  Oh my God, my whole world, my whole reality is blown up!
[02:37:51.649 --> 02:37:53.890]  Because you belong in a mental hospital!
[02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:54.731]  Oh, I can't wait.
[02:37:54.811 --> 02:37:56.592]  They're going to be so butthurt.
[02:37:56.912 --> 02:37:58.933]  These people are going to be so triggered tomorrow.
[02:37:59.233 --> 02:38:00.233]  Trump pulls this off.
[02:38:00.333 --> 02:38:01.654]  It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.
[02:38:02.586 --> 02:38:04.207]  I can already taste the bubbly.
[02:38:04.347 --> 02:38:08.129]  All right, Eddie Griffin, he's going to move to Africa.
[02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:12.072]  Now, he says Trump is good at making money, but he's ignorant.
[02:38:12.112 --> 02:38:14.453]  Well, I got news for you, Eddie Griffin.
[02:38:14.633 --> 02:38:21.337]  If you think you're better off in Africa than America, you, my friend, are the ignorant one.
[02:38:21.697 --> 02:38:22.438]  Here's another one.
[02:38:23.198 --> 02:38:24.300]  Spike Lee!
[02:38:24.761 --> 02:38:26.744]  Spike Lee says he's going to move to Brooklyn.
[02:38:26.944 --> 02:38:31.130]  Spike Lee might be a little ignorant too because Brooklyn is still in the United States.
[02:38:31.731 --> 02:38:36.178]  So maybe go back to school and take a geography class or read a book.
[02:38:36.498 --> 02:38:36.919]  Spike Lee.
[02:38:37.159 --> 02:38:38.020]  Here's the thing about Spike Lee.
[02:38:39.028 --> 02:38:40.609]  Spike Lee is a known racist.
[02:38:40.629 --> 02:38:41.550]  I was going to say the same thing.
[02:38:41.570 --> 02:38:42.511]  He hates white people.
[02:38:43.091 --> 02:38:44.272]  He talks about this all the time.
[02:38:44.973 --> 02:38:45.734]  So I don't know.
[02:38:45.894 --> 02:38:50.958]  I mean, maybe, you know, I guess if Trump gets in, he can't stand the fact it's a white president.
[02:38:51.779 --> 02:38:53.820]  But Brooklyn is still in the United States, buddy.
[02:38:53.860 --> 02:38:56.222]  So Trump is still going to be your president.
[02:38:56.403 --> 02:38:58.064]  Amber Rose, I've never heard of this.
[02:38:58.624 --> 02:39:01.427]  Wait a minute, we have somebody infiltrated the studio.
[02:39:01.667 --> 02:39:04.569]  Alex, what do you think about all these celebrities who are going to move out of the country?
[02:39:05.370 --> 02:39:05.910]  If Trump wins.
[02:39:06.411 --> 02:39:08.212]  God, I hope they get the hell out of here.
[02:39:08.252 --> 02:39:17.178]  That little former Democratic Party head, head of the Clinton operation, Stephanopoulos, who's been caught in the WikiLeaks scripting the news, lying to America.
[02:39:17.518 --> 02:39:21.841]  Please get the hell out of America and get out the way, bitch!
[02:39:22.001 --> 02:39:22.341]  Move, bitch!
[02:39:22.381 --> 02:39:22.942]  Get out the way!
[02:39:23.122 --> 02:39:25.323]  Don't let the door hit you in the ass.
[02:39:25.343 --> 02:39:31.147]  Do you think they realize that them moving Obama saying that we need Clinton is the biggest endorsement for Trump?
[02:39:31.187 --> 02:39:31.808]  Do they realize this?
[02:39:31.828 --> 02:39:34.950]  I'm gonna go get in the studio and dial into you guys right now, because see what I love about McGreen?
[02:39:35.870 --> 02:39:38.072]  He's one of the best conversationalists behind the scenes around here.
[02:39:38.512 --> 02:39:41.494]  But then he loves to do these scripted, edited videos he does that are wonderful.
[02:39:41.934 --> 02:39:44.295]  I like the fact that we're having a real conversation on air with Darren McBrain.
[02:39:44.635 --> 02:39:45.436]  My God, man.
[02:39:45.476 --> 02:39:45.916]  Can you believe it?
[02:39:45.936 --> 02:39:46.677]  My God, man.
[02:39:46.897 --> 02:39:47.617]  Jim, look at you.
[02:39:47.657 --> 02:39:49.358]  You're a doctor, not an Easter Bunny.
[02:39:49.838 --> 02:39:51.419]  So, I'm going to get to the studio.
[02:39:51.439 --> 02:39:52.980]  We're going to all do this together.
[02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:54.121]  I love it.
[02:39:54.141 --> 02:39:55.662]  Alex Jones is about to join us.
[02:39:56.842 --> 02:39:58.523]  Amber Rose, she's going to leave too.
[02:40:00.438 --> 02:40:04.239]  Yeah, give out that phone number.
[02:40:04.439 --> 02:40:06.420]  It's 1-877-789-ALEX.
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:06.960]  1-877-789-ALEX, folks.
[02:40:06.980 --> 02:40:08.581]  We're going to be on air for a long time tonight.
[02:40:08.641 --> 02:40:10.462]  I can already tell that.
[02:40:10.602 --> 02:40:12.042]  Well, you're not done with the list yet, are you?
[02:40:12.062 --> 02:40:13.283]  We're not even done with the list.
[02:40:13.303 --> 02:40:14.283]  We've got Jones coming on.
[02:40:14.323 --> 02:40:15.403]  We've got guests coming up.
[02:40:15.423 --> 02:40:16.884]  We've got Maggie about to come too.
[02:40:17.224 --> 02:40:17.904]  This is crazy.
[02:40:18.104 --> 02:40:21.826]  So far, there's not anybody on this list that's disappointing to me.
[02:40:22.066 --> 02:40:22.586]  You know what I mean?
[02:40:24.838 --> 02:40:26.939]  Alright, we got a caller who wants to talk about Amy Schumer.
[02:40:26.979 --> 02:40:28.360]  I'm gonna miss Amy Schumer!
[02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:30.380]  I don't know what I'm gonna do, Donald!
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:31.561]  Please pull out of the race!
[02:40:31.841 --> 02:40:33.662]  I can't stand to lose Amy Schumer!
[02:40:34.022 --> 02:40:34.702]  Oh my God!
[02:40:34.722 --> 02:40:35.363]  Uh-oh!
[02:40:35.703 --> 02:40:36.703]  Uh-oh, let's go to the caller.
[02:40:36.843 --> 02:40:37.303]  I got it.
[02:40:37.724 --> 02:40:38.044]  I got it.
[02:40:39.004 --> 02:40:39.825]  Oh, Owen's triggered.
[02:40:39.965 --> 02:40:40.765]  Who's Amy Schumer?
[02:40:40.785 --> 02:40:42.486]  This will be a day long remembered.
[02:40:42.506 --> 02:40:42.886]  Oh, caller!
[02:40:42.906 --> 02:40:46.227]  The planet is clear to fire in T-minus three minutes.
[02:40:46.247 --> 02:40:47.288]  I think you scared her.
[02:40:47.388 --> 02:40:48.408]  I think I scared the caller.
[02:40:48.428 --> 02:40:49.549]  Well, hey, I mean, if, you know...
[02:40:50.498 --> 02:41:01.107]  Folks, we need to do, you can either choose to do everything you can to save this country and elect Donald Trump, or you can do everything you can to keep Amy Schumer in the United States.
[02:41:01.147 --> 02:41:01.848]  I choose the latter.
[02:41:01.868 --> 02:41:04.150]  I don't know guys, what's the deal with the caller?
[02:41:04.170 --> 02:41:04.750]  Can we get callers?
[02:41:05.050 --> 02:41:06.131]  No, I'm breaking in.
[02:41:06.231 --> 02:41:07.112]  Connect me in or they hear me.
[02:41:07.172 --> 02:41:12.577]  Okay, well, let's just go back until I guess we get Alex Gild in here.
[02:41:12.597 --> 02:41:17.021]  Amber Rose, she can't.
[02:41:18.220 --> 02:41:19.001]  That's what she says.
[02:41:19.461 --> 02:41:19.822]  What's that?
[02:41:19.902 --> 02:41:20.403]  I'm sorry.
[02:41:20.703 --> 02:41:21.524]  What's that back there?
[02:41:32.972 --> 02:41:34.593]  With low, low ratings.
[02:41:34.633 --> 02:41:35.393]  No one was watching it.
[02:41:35.553 --> 02:41:37.493]  She's just a totally planted celebrity.
[02:41:37.513 --> 02:41:38.434]  She's got no organic candidate.
[02:41:38.474 --> 02:41:41.034]  She did seem like she got success overnight, didn't she?
[02:41:41.094 --> 02:41:41.815]  All of a sudden she's everywhere.
[02:41:41.835 --> 02:41:42.435]  She's not even funny!
[02:41:42.555 --> 02:41:43.775]  What has she done that's funny?
[02:41:44.275 --> 02:41:46.556]  Besides get fat and act like a dumbass.
[02:41:46.656 --> 02:41:47.616]  On a complete slut.
[02:41:47.837 --> 02:41:50.317]  She's doing the whole slut routine, which is real popular.
[02:41:50.517 --> 02:41:50.637]  Oh!
[02:41:51.017 --> 02:41:51.098]  Oh!
[02:41:51.118 --> 02:41:51.158]  Oh!
[02:41:51.618 --> 02:41:53.418]  I'm sorry, I'm not supposed to call you fat.
[02:41:54.138 --> 02:41:58.580]  You could be a 300 pound blob on the couch, but you know, I'm not supposed to call you fat.
[02:41:58.660 --> 02:41:58.960]  I'm sorry.
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:08.884]  I don't mean to interrupt the caller, but I now realize we have a bunch of different studios and we're doing this live with Skeleton Crew doing a great job, and I was babbling over everybody while I was about to hear them, but we'll go back to the caller in a moment.
[02:42:09.304 --> 02:42:19.229]  Let me just say that this is all divide and conquer, as if women will be better off without men, or men will be better off without women.
[02:42:19.329 --> 02:42:25.452]  It's all an admitted plan to end our species as we know it, and they force-feed this not-funny
[02:42:26.332 --> 02:42:27.693]  Woman on everybody.
[02:42:28.153 --> 02:42:33.415]  They put hormones in the food and water so that we're overweight and then say we're bad to point out it's happening.
[02:42:33.795 --> 02:42:36.055]  Like, why is breast cancer up 3,000%?
[02:42:36.416 --> 02:42:37.816]  Because it's what they're doing to us.
[02:42:37.876 --> 02:42:43.498]  So, this is just some sad collaborator that was brought in to sell us on this whole deal.
[02:42:44.018 --> 02:42:45.859]  All the real women are awake at what's happening.
[02:42:45.879 --> 02:42:46.959]  They're just looking for real men.
[02:42:47.379 --> 02:42:49.760]  The average man's busy watching the NFL and acting tough.
[02:42:49.780 --> 02:42:53.522]  But Owen and Darren McBreen, what an epic time to be alive.
[02:42:53.542 --> 02:42:54.082]  Because here's the deal.
[02:42:54.682 --> 02:42:56.183]  We'll tell you what the real polls are.
[02:42:56.503 --> 02:42:59.045]  We won't sit there and tell you somebody's ahead when they're not.
[02:42:59.125 --> 02:43:02.787]  We told you they were going to steal the nomination from Trump and that they would fail.
[02:43:02.847 --> 02:43:03.267]  They failed.
[02:43:03.708 --> 02:43:05.509]  We told you they'd steal it from Bernie and succeed.
[02:43:05.529 --> 02:43:06.069]  They succeeded.
[02:43:06.589 --> 02:43:10.992]  We told you that the chemical weapons attack in Syria were launched by Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[02:43:11.052 --> 02:43:11.712]  It was later admitted.
[02:43:12.333 --> 02:43:13.313]  We have the sources.
[02:43:13.413 --> 02:43:14.014]  It's not hard.
[02:43:14.434 --> 02:43:15.795]  And let me give people a big secret here.
[02:43:17.636 --> 02:43:22.179]  Most, and this is why I used to follow more leftist brainwashing 15 years ago.
[02:43:23.297 --> 02:43:24.858]  I got part of the problem, but not all of it.
[02:43:25.439 --> 02:43:33.684]  Compared to the general public that are a bunch of jellyfish, the military and people in the intelligence agencies want us to be strong and take the country back.
[02:43:34.145 --> 02:43:40.049]  They're risking their lives, so on average they're generally a little more flesh in the game than the average person.
[02:43:41.069 --> 02:43:43.611]  But it's our weakness that allows all this to happen.
[02:43:43.631 --> 02:43:47.033]  It's not the TSA's problem, groping our genitals, all the borders wide open.
[02:43:47.833 --> 02:43:52.076]  It's that we're allowing a central government to do this, to train us to be slaves.
[02:43:52.156 --> 02:43:56.999]  So, what I'm getting at here is, maybe the cops are good, maybe they're bad.
[02:43:57.079 --> 02:43:57.660]  The point is,
[02:43:58.240 --> 02:43:59.320]  It depends on the jurisdiction.
[02:44:16.607 --> 02:44:20.189]  They have a 10% lower corporate tax, meaning our jobs go there.
[02:44:20.569 --> 02:44:21.670]  We match that.
[02:44:21.830 --> 02:44:22.450]  They're done.
[02:44:22.751 --> 02:44:28.074]  By the way, I'll cut your taxes by 50% and eliminate people paying taxes under $45,000 a year.
[02:44:28.934 --> 02:44:30.876]  Dumbasses say, well, we won't be able to pay off the debt.
[02:44:31.616 --> 02:44:36.221]  You cut taxes on the general public, it turns up the economy, more tax receipts come in.
[02:44:36.241 --> 02:44:43.669]  I'm not going to go over the history of that, but I've got thousands of points to make, but I keep going back to that because JFK did it.
[02:44:44.369 --> 02:44:48.854]  It turned the economy loose and they killed him because of it, because he wanted to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[02:44:49.414 --> 02:44:50.135]  I'm informed!
[02:44:51.096 --> 02:44:59.541]  And pseudo-intellectuals at Salon, who write articles about how pedophilia is a great thing, criticize me and make up quotes I didn't say.
[02:44:59.561 --> 02:45:01.381]  Let me just give Salon a little newsflash.
[02:45:02.082 --> 02:45:04.323]  We're ten times bigger than you with our website.
[02:45:04.543 --> 02:45:06.044]  Our website's a small part of what we do.
[02:45:06.464 --> 02:45:09.586]  Please, when you're promoting pedophilia,
[02:45:10.166 --> 02:45:15.191]  And big, fat, degenerate pedophiles talking about five-year-old girls and how much they want them.
[02:45:15.651 --> 02:45:17.433]  Please demonize me.
[02:45:17.953 --> 02:45:19.855]  Please say you're against me.
[02:45:19.895 --> 02:45:30.164]  But see, they're so in their own bubble as traitors, they think, hey, we're out here with our tallywhackers swinging around, wanting to, you know, grab girls out of the backyard or whatever and take them for a ride.
[02:45:30.805 --> 02:45:32.826]  That you think I'm the bad guy?
[02:45:33.486 --> 02:45:35.306]  Because I came from a good family?
[02:45:36.046 --> 02:45:38.207]  And I can kick 50-year asses?
[02:45:38.787 --> 02:45:39.767]  Not that I'm that tough!
[02:45:39.947 --> 02:45:40.648]  You're that low!
[02:45:41.028 --> 02:45:42.388]  You people aren't men!
[02:45:42.728 --> 02:45:43.668]  You're not humans!
[02:45:44.269 --> 02:45:53.371]  You're telling us all day why we're not humans, why we're ugly, why we're over, why we're pathetic, because you are living sacks of shit!
[02:45:54.449 --> 02:46:00.537]  And you need to get it through your head that if you want to bang heads with us, we're going to bang heads.
[02:46:00.837 --> 02:46:05.543]  And our big thick skulls and our big craniums are going to smash you into the ground.
[02:46:05.763 --> 02:46:06.785]  And listen, I get it.
[02:46:07.864 --> 02:46:10.346]  You're psychopaths, you're sociopaths, you're criminals.
[02:46:10.886 --> 02:46:14.388]  And in your criminology, you're always begging to get put in your place genetically.
[02:46:14.408 --> 02:46:17.050]  Because your body realizes you're subconscious, hidden evil.
[02:46:17.270 --> 02:46:21.052]  Your conscious is your body saying, kill me, kill me, kill me.
[02:46:21.492 --> 02:46:23.033]  Please, somebody come and kill me.
[02:46:23.053 --> 02:46:25.155]  And listen, here's the good news.
[02:46:25.795 --> 02:46:29.858]  Metaphysically, we've already woke up from our slumber.
[02:46:30.799 --> 02:46:32.080]  The return of man is here.
[02:46:32.821 --> 02:46:35.464]  And our hands are now wrapping around your throats.
[02:46:35.504 --> 02:46:36.165]  And here's the thing.
[02:46:36.866 --> 02:46:40.189]  We don't want to strangle you, but you want it.
[02:46:40.990 --> 02:46:42.252]  And you're not going to stop.
[02:46:42.973 --> 02:46:44.394]  So here's the news for you.
[02:46:45.075 --> 02:46:46.677]  You're going to get what you want.
[02:46:47.718 --> 02:46:49.880]  And the return of humanity is here.
[02:46:50.461 --> 02:46:51.862]  You were only there to test us.
[02:46:52.765 --> 02:46:56.566]  You were only there metaphysically and allowed your limited gateway to rape us, to activate us.
[02:46:56.586 --> 02:46:56.826]  So now,
[02:47:23.061 --> 02:47:25.451]  Make no mistake, you wanna come in contact?
[02:47:27.158 --> 02:47:27.982]  You're gonna get it!
[02:47:28.877 --> 02:47:29.998]  And it's only the beginning.
[02:47:30.258 --> 02:47:34.801]  Whether Trump loses, wins, draws, the spirit of liberty is rising.
[02:47:34.861 --> 02:47:37.463]  Owen Schroyer, Darren McBrain, other points you'd like to make?
[02:47:38.144 --> 02:47:44.488]  Well, you know, I think what makes me so ticked off about these celebrities is their arrogance.
[02:47:44.768 --> 02:47:45.469]  They're nothing!
[02:47:45.509 --> 02:47:46.650]  They're pieces of crap!
[02:47:46.670 --> 02:47:47.070]  Exactly!
[02:47:47.150 --> 02:47:48.931]  And they come out and they're so arrogant.
[02:47:49.151 --> 02:47:56.297]  I don't want to brag, because I'm not bragging, but my greatest enjoyment in life, after taking care of my family, is pissing on Hollywood.
[02:47:57.237 --> 02:47:58.298]  I am not bragging.
[02:47:59.079 --> 02:48:01.641]  I have got Discovery Channel shows, I don't even do them anymore.
[02:48:02.061 --> 02:48:02.642]  Top shows.
[02:48:02.922 --> 02:48:03.602]  Never watched them.
[02:48:04.423 --> 02:48:06.925]  Major movies out where they license clips of the show.
[02:48:06.985 --> 02:48:08.727]  It's all over movies.
[02:48:08.747 --> 02:48:12.189]  I don't even go see myself in a movie because it's satanic.
[02:48:12.750 --> 02:48:14.011]  I piss on your movies.
[02:48:14.451 --> 02:48:15.552]  I piss on you.
[02:48:15.912 --> 02:48:17.113]  I piss on your fame.
[02:48:17.434 --> 02:48:18.695]  I piss on your fraud.
[02:48:19.015 --> 02:48:20.836]  I piss on your God, the devil.
[02:48:20.856 --> 02:48:21.177]  Go ahead.
[02:48:21.637 --> 02:48:22.458]  And that's why I want to
[02:48:23.058 --> 02:48:28.743]  Take a political piss on Amy Schumer by voting in Donald Trump because you're not going to control our destiny.
[02:48:28.803 --> 02:48:38.570]  Amy Schumer is a pathetic, empty, talentless, cancerous, pathetic, empty blob who is just there to create division and she doesn't even know why.
[02:48:38.951 --> 02:48:43.695]  She knows she says stuff and her managers pat her on her little
[02:48:45.001 --> 02:48:46.101]  Rotten brain, go ahead.
[02:48:46.741 --> 02:48:47.882]  I think that's it, right there.
[02:48:48.102 --> 02:48:50.922]  From here on out, folks, let's trend this on social media.
[02:48:51.042 --> 02:48:52.722]  Amy Schumer is the blob.
[02:48:53.683 --> 02:48:55.103]  Amy Schumer is the blob.
[02:48:55.423 --> 02:48:57.563]  From now on, we will just refer to her as the blob.
[02:48:57.583 --> 02:49:02.644]  University of A&M created systems to, like, make male and female fire ants not breed.
[02:49:03.224 --> 02:49:13.286]  She's a scientific program to make the species kill itself, and so she's the goddess of death to teach us to kill ourselves and to not want women.
[02:49:13.726 --> 02:49:20.172]  She's a goddess of death to teach women to hate men and to teach men to hate women and not have the incredible holy union.
[02:49:20.413 --> 02:49:21.714]  She's an abomination.
[02:49:21.954 --> 02:49:23.696]  She's a satanic ritual.
[02:49:24.317 --> 02:49:27.320]  She's the opposite of sexual pleasure that God gave us.
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:34.427]  You deliver that speech and then you present Amy Schumer as your evidence and you will win any court case, my friend.
[02:49:35.939 --> 02:49:44.829]  I mean, look at you, look at her, she's just another fake trendy with a bunch of old hunchback Hollywood people that are bought off by the communist Chinese who got a one-child policy and kill women if they have babies.
[02:49:44.909 --> 02:49:49.574]  I mean, they can't get that through here, so just... China has a one-child policy to kill women.
[02:49:50.094 --> 02:49:52.517]  To kill women, we give men Amy Schumer, and the men are like...
[02:49:52.657 --> 02:49:54.198]  God, I'm gonna kill myself immediately!
[02:49:54.439 --> 02:50:01.024]  Yeah, and then she gets, you know, she gains 40-50 pounds eating fried chicken and ice cream and then tells you this is what beauty is!
[02:50:01.344 --> 02:50:02.586]  It's beautiful to be fat!
[02:50:03.346 --> 02:50:05.488]  Whatever, you can be fat, you can be skinny, you can do whatever you want.
[02:50:05.528 --> 02:50:07.610]  Don't tell me what the definition of beauty is!
[02:50:07.630 --> 02:50:11.913]  That's right, it's all about this Rockefeller Foundation creature.
[02:50:13.004 --> 02:50:15.365]  Telling you, like they first tell you it's heroin chic.
[02:50:15.845 --> 02:50:20.746]  Mama's got to look like some 14 year old kid because you got all these weirdos that want a guy that are into the fashion.
[02:50:20.786 --> 02:50:21.526]  That's wrong too.
[02:50:21.866 --> 02:50:22.767]  We want Marilyn Monroe.
[02:50:22.947 --> 02:50:24.347]  We want Baboom Baboom.
[02:50:24.747 --> 02:50:32.669]  But, then the next phase is, take some piglet woman that hates men, like every other movie is, and teach women that's the secret.
[02:50:32.989 --> 02:50:35.150]  That's just how to put women alone and shut down their lives.
[02:50:35.530 --> 02:50:36.290]  Hey, here's the bottom line.
[02:50:36.310 --> 02:50:37.310]  Let's go to RedSupport.com.
[02:50:37.831 --> 02:50:38.711]  Infowars.com.
[02:50:38.851 --> 02:50:39.131]  Viewers.
[02:50:40.404 --> 02:50:41.164]  I'll be honest with you.
[02:50:41.524 --> 02:50:43.825]  I've been up since 4.30 this morning.
[02:50:44.366 --> 02:50:45.366]  Slept a little late this morning.
[02:50:45.386 --> 02:50:45.986]  I apologize.
[02:50:46.807 --> 02:50:50.488]  And all I know is last time I checked, we had like 5 million views on Facebook and Google.
[02:50:50.508 --> 02:50:55.230]  Listen, we need 50 million, 100 million.
[02:50:55.270 --> 02:50:59.572]  We need to not be bigger than CNN.
[02:51:00.192 --> 02:51:01.013]  We need to be
[02:51:02.984 --> 02:51:03.744]  Ten times bigger.
[02:51:04.344 --> 02:51:07.605]  And to rub it into them and their patheticness and their scripting.
[02:51:07.625 --> 02:51:11.326]  Hey, Owen Schroyer, Darren McBreen, is there any scripting here at InfoWars?
[02:51:11.606 --> 02:51:11.986]  Be honest.
[02:51:12.226 --> 02:51:13.567]  Tell folks the inside secrets.
[02:51:14.027 --> 02:51:14.327]  None.
[02:51:14.807 --> 02:51:19.168]  You won't find one teleprompter in this huge, ginormous facility that we have.
[02:51:19.188 --> 02:51:20.728]  No, but if I give you directives, what is it like?
[02:51:20.768 --> 02:51:21.869]  Hey, she's trying to start World War III.
[02:51:21.909 --> 02:51:22.429]  Look into that.
[02:51:22.489 --> 02:51:23.309]  Or look at this social.
[02:51:23.329 --> 02:51:25.129]  I mean, what directives do you get here?
[02:51:25.149 --> 02:51:26.350]  Oh, we do our own news.
[02:51:26.410 --> 02:51:27.210]  We come up with our own
[02:51:27.210 --> 02:51:28.151]  I forgot, I did actually do that.
[02:51:28.331 --> 02:51:30.192]  I mean, what is it like to have a boss that does that?
[02:51:55.706 --> 02:51:56.707]  I forgot, that's like real.
[02:51:57.427 --> 02:51:59.949]  No, that was, that was, I was sitting at my desk this morning.
[02:52:00.629 --> 02:52:05.372]  I was, I don't even remember what I was looking into and Alex popped in before he went on air.
[02:52:05.693 --> 02:52:07.794]  He said, All on attack today!
[02:52:07.974 --> 02:52:08.995]  We're taking them down!
[02:52:09.215 --> 02:52:10.896]  This is the awakening of America!
[02:52:11.076 --> 02:52:12.177]  You are the resistance!
[02:52:12.857 --> 02:52:12.938]  AHH!
[02:52:12.978 --> 02:52:13.938]  And then everybody said AHH!
[02:52:15.799 --> 02:52:19.201]  And here we are, live for over 10 hours and not even sweating yet.
[02:52:19.562 --> 02:52:20.662]  Yeah, well, what's 11 a.m.
[02:52:20.682 --> 02:52:21.183]  to right now?
[02:52:21.243 --> 02:52:21.603]  You're right.
[02:52:22.143 --> 02:52:22.804]  God, I love it.
[02:52:23.324 --> 02:52:25.146]  Uh, McBrain, let's put you on the spot.
[02:52:25.186 --> 02:52:26.807]  McBrain's the best conversationalist ever.
[02:52:27.447 --> 02:52:35.173]  But, just like, I have this phobia of names, where I'll have somebody's name that's a little different, so I know how to say the name, you'll probably get it on air, then I get this thing, because I want to respect them.
[02:52:35.573 --> 02:52:38.475]  So, because I respect somebody, I can't say their name right, because I feel like I'm disrespecting.
[02:52:38.715 --> 02:52:40.977]  So, I get McBrain choking occasionally on air.
[02:52:40.997 --> 02:52:42.178]  He's one of the best reporters we got.
[02:52:42.518 --> 02:52:43.338]  Great graphics person.
[02:52:43.639 --> 02:52:45.240]  McBrain, just talk for five minutes by yourself.
[02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:45.520]  Go ahead.
[02:52:45.740 --> 02:52:46.961]  I'm going to talk for five minutes, right?
[02:52:47.021 --> 02:52:47.581]  Set the clock.
[02:52:47.601 --> 02:52:49.101]  Alright, we're going.
[02:52:49.161 --> 02:52:49.942]  Okay, ten seconds.
[02:52:50.042 --> 02:52:50.582]  Alright, here we go.
[02:52:50.662 --> 02:52:52.043]  It's ten fifty-nine fifty.
[02:52:52.643 --> 02:52:53.903]  Ten fifty-nine fifty-three.
[02:52:54.704 --> 02:52:55.304]  Fifty-four.
[02:52:55.324 --> 02:52:56.044]  Alright, tune him out.
[02:52:56.084 --> 02:52:57.325]  Fifty-five.
[02:52:57.425 --> 02:52:58.945]  Hold on.
[02:52:59.005 --> 02:52:59.545]  Cut his mic.
[02:52:59.726 --> 02:53:00.246]  Cut his mic.
[02:53:00.266 --> 02:53:01.226]  Alright, you got four minutes.
[02:53:01.266 --> 02:53:01.806]  You're live now.
[02:53:01.826 --> 02:53:02.487]  Go ahead, McBrain.
[02:53:02.507 --> 02:53:03.347]  It's eleven o'clock.
[02:53:03.587 --> 02:53:10.517]  All right, well, Owen, you can join in anytime, but look, we're talking about what would the world be like right now without Donald Trump, okay?
[02:53:10.697 --> 02:53:16.805]  If we would be looking at the stereotypical left versus right paradigm, right?
[02:53:17.166 --> 02:53:20.210]  But something tells me that since Donald Trump has been in there,
[02:53:21.051 --> 02:53:25.252]  With these WikiLeaks, would there be even these WikiLeaks if it wasn't for Trump?
[02:53:25.352 --> 02:53:31.213]  I think they sense this humongous, this huge push right now to overtake the globalist elites.
[02:53:31.993 --> 02:53:40.835]  And instead of like Hillary Clinton's out there claiming that it's the Russians, the Russians are planning all these stories or it's the Russians who are hacking the emails.
[02:53:41.275 --> 02:53:42.915]  No, it's not the Russians.
[02:53:43.376 --> 02:53:45.296]  This is... Hold on.
[02:53:45.956 --> 02:53:47.037]  Yes.
[02:53:47.637 --> 02:53:48.677]  I hear something.
[02:53:49.258 --> 02:53:50.238]  Was that Alex Jones?
[02:53:50.258 --> 02:53:51.319]  Don't turn my guns in!
[02:53:51.419 --> 02:53:52.179]  Okay, I agree with you.
[02:53:52.279 --> 02:53:52.799]  It's Russia.
[02:53:52.860 --> 02:53:53.980]  Hold on, Russia's on the phone.
[02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:54.780]  Is Russia on the phone?
[02:53:55.101 --> 02:53:57.482]  Sorry, I said you're a woman and I'm already interrupting.
[02:53:57.522 --> 02:53:58.963]  Total genius.
[02:53:59.003 --> 02:54:03.965]  Look, Hillary Clinton claims it's the Russians, but we know that it's the intelligence community.
[02:54:04.005 --> 02:54:07.707]  This is basically an internal coup d'etat within the intelligence community.
[02:54:07.727 --> 02:54:08.627]  A counter to the coup d'etat.
[02:54:08.747 --> 02:54:09.308]  Exactly.
[02:54:09.808 --> 02:54:10.788]  That's a better way to put it.
[02:54:10.808 --> 02:54:11.809]  Which is French for coup d'etat.
[02:54:12.729 --> 02:54:15.850]  And we've talked with NSA whistleblower William Benny.
[02:54:16.230 --> 02:54:20.352]  We've had Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer on the show.
[02:54:20.832 --> 02:54:24.813]  And they are basically saying that all these WikiLeaks are coming from within.
[02:54:24.873 --> 02:54:26.393]  I think that says a lot.
[02:54:26.413 --> 02:54:28.914]  McBrain, you're only... Hold on, Owen!
[02:54:29.094 --> 02:54:30.095]  He's two minutes in.
[02:54:30.475 --> 02:54:31.955]  Most eloquent guy in the whole office.
[02:54:32.535 --> 02:54:33.636]  McBrain has to continue.
[02:54:33.656 --> 02:54:34.316]  McBrain, go ahead.
[02:54:36.121 --> 02:54:38.002]  Hey, I need some feedback, man.
[02:54:38.022 --> 02:54:38.663]  Come on, man.
[02:54:38.883 --> 02:54:39.784]  I asked a question.
[02:54:39.984 --> 02:54:42.866]  Look, I tell you what, he answers my question, I'll go on for another ten.
[02:54:42.886 --> 02:54:43.847]  Okay, go ahead, Alan.
[02:54:44.027 --> 02:54:48.550]  So I think that my answer to the question is, where would we be without Trump right now?
[02:54:48.570 --> 02:54:56.696]  I think we would still be in the same vacuum that we've been in, where we're sitting here banging our heads against the wall, we're sitting here parroting the same thing trying to get the truth out.
[02:54:56.716 --> 02:54:57.497]  We finally got a candidate.
[02:54:57.777 --> 02:54:58.818]  That would call out the fix.
[02:54:59.358 --> 02:55:00.879]  Exactly, but it goes beyond that.
[02:55:00.939 --> 02:55:03.420]  I mean, not just does he call out the fix, he gets detailed.
[02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:04.661]  We've had candidates say it's fixed.
[02:55:04.801 --> 02:55:06.842]  Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Obama, they've said it before.
[02:55:07.162 --> 02:55:08.102]  He goes into detail.
[02:55:08.302 --> 02:55:09.523]  He talks about the trade.
[02:55:09.763 --> 02:55:11.304]  He talks about Obamacare.
[02:55:11.524 --> 02:55:12.545]  He talks about everything.
[02:55:12.585 --> 02:55:13.565]  What, the Wrigley Leaks, the secret deals.
[02:55:13.585 --> 02:55:14.726]  He talks about the board, exactly.
[02:55:14.766 --> 02:55:16.066]  How they run it, the tech.
[02:55:16.126 --> 02:55:17.147]  He lays it out.
[02:55:17.167 --> 02:55:17.807]  He lays it out.
[02:55:18.688 --> 02:55:22.830]  Trump won't lay out his specifics when for a year it's all been on his website.
[02:55:23.490 --> 02:55:25.932]  He's like, not only on his website, he says it publicly.
[02:55:25.992 --> 02:55:27.433]  He detailed plans.
[02:55:27.833 --> 02:55:34.638]  It's like, it's almost as if we're the Batman and for all this time we've just been a legend.
[02:55:34.818 --> 02:55:35.919]  We've never really existed.
[02:55:35.959 --> 02:55:41.704]  But now all of a sudden Trump is here and he's the bat, the light, the bat light in the sky saying it's time!
[02:55:42.324 --> 02:55:43.645]  Like, the Batman is real!
[02:55:43.705 --> 02:55:44.425]  We're fighting!
[02:55:44.445 --> 02:55:46.266]  This is a real fight!
[02:55:46.606 --> 02:55:48.387]  That was part of the illustration in the movie.
[02:55:48.687 --> 02:55:53.650]  The whole reason Lieutenant Gordon would flip the light on is so that people would be like, we're not alone!
[02:55:54.050 --> 02:55:54.650]  We're fighting!
[02:55:54.690 --> 02:55:55.651]  There's somebody out there!
[02:55:55.751 --> 02:55:59.793]  Even if the Batman wasn't there, he flips the light on so that the people feel confident!
[02:55:59.833 --> 02:56:01.994]  And now let's talk about it before you go back to calls and I leave you.
[02:56:03.115 --> 02:56:07.498]  We have 24 hours more just of this next day and then more 52 hours broadcast.
[02:56:07.518 --> 02:56:08.519]  We're like 12 hours in.
[02:56:09.099 --> 02:56:10.680]  So there's 40 hours left or so.
[02:56:11.140 --> 02:56:12.781]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:56:12.801 --> 02:56:14.402]  I'm not bitching.
[02:56:14.963 --> 02:56:19.005]  We've only had 5, 6 million viewers separate from our regular audience, but let's do 20.
[02:56:19.065 --> 02:56:21.007]  There'll be 20 tomorrow.
[02:56:21.027 --> 02:56:21.947]  It's going to be huge.
[02:56:22.047 --> 02:56:22.347]  It's huge.
[02:56:22.367 --> 02:56:24.169]  But we need to really embarrass everybody.
[02:56:24.209 --> 02:56:29.792]  So if the audience sends the links out, Infowars.com forward slash show, the YouTube, the Facebook, all of it's going to be huge.
[02:56:30.112 --> 02:56:31.293]  Just to show how pathetic they are.
[02:56:31.313 --> 02:56:32.094]  But let me ask you this question.
[02:56:32.930 --> 02:56:40.914]  Hillary and the globalists have staged the polls, they've staged exit polls, they've staged media, they've lied, they've gotten all the corporate money.
[02:56:41.534 --> 02:56:43.855]  Infowars.com forward slash election has it all posted.
[02:56:44.275 --> 02:56:57.001]  They've done all of this and so if they've already been ready to expose themselves and lie and say that if you're against Obamacare you're a KKK member while Hillary's hanging out with the Grand Dragons, why wouldn't they try to steal it?
[02:56:57.601 --> 02:56:58.741]  Because they know we won't buy it.
[02:56:59.041 --> 02:56:59.882]  So Owen and
[02:57:01.164 --> 02:57:01.804]  Darren McBreen.
[02:57:31.104 --> 02:57:31.705]  It's epic times.
[02:57:46.884 --> 02:57:49.025]  I think he's going to win by a landslide.
[02:57:49.045 --> 02:57:53.007]  So the only possible way for Hillary to win is by massive voter fraud.
[02:57:53.367 --> 02:58:01.371]  But then we're also talking about the top link on Drudge right now is all hands on deck to protect election hack.
[02:58:01.711 --> 02:58:03.232]  So they're saying U.S.
[02:58:03.292 --> 02:58:09.895]  officials are preparing for a cyber attack from Russia to swing the vote in favor of Donald Trump.
[02:58:09.935 --> 02:58:10.876]  Talk about horse crap.
[02:58:10.896 --> 02:58:11.456]  The Russians are
[02:58:11.476 --> 02:58:11.756]  I think so.
[02:58:32.566 --> 02:58:35.509]  And then they turn it around, the Russians are behind it.
[02:58:35.990 --> 02:58:37.231]  This is not the Feds.
[02:58:37.732 --> 02:58:39.654]  This is the globalists running the Feds.
[02:58:40.355 --> 02:58:43.478]  Every election fraud piece of news coming out is against Trump.
[02:58:43.559 --> 02:58:50.086]  So, again, we see Trump winning, we see polls showing him winning, we see him way ahead in battleground states, a huge shift.
[02:58:50.466 --> 02:58:51.628]  That means nothing because
[02:58:52.068 --> 02:58:53.128]  They're so arrogant.
[02:58:53.509 --> 02:58:55.529]  What difference does it make about Benghazi?
[02:58:55.849 --> 02:59:04.232]  She steals furniture at the State Department, the White House, the cutlery, the spoons, the knives, the forks, the saucers, the plates.
[02:59:04.772 --> 02:59:09.154]  I mean, you know, the salad dressing, you know, boats, the gravy boats.
[02:59:09.494 --> 02:59:12.555]  I mean, there's nothing this demon won't do, McBrain.
[02:59:13.430 --> 02:59:27.065]  Well, and I think, too, you know, Alex, what you said earlier about these elements inside the government that are pushing back, it's because they're looking at the American public finally seeing some life, and they're hoping that... Yeah, finally, I'm not blaming the government, it's true.
[02:59:27.265 --> 02:59:30.308]  They keep saying, like in Viva Veneta, I was waiting for you, Inspector.
[02:59:30.729 --> 02:59:31.149]  It's true.
[02:59:31.550 --> 02:59:33.151]  They're actually more active than us.
[02:59:33.772 --> 02:59:35.153]  So we can't piss on them.
[02:59:35.233 --> 02:59:36.193]  We're Americans too.
[02:59:36.613 --> 02:59:37.634]  They're waiting for us.
[02:59:54.020 --> 02:59:57.503]  We've got Democratic operatives showing up and saying, I've got a gun and going after Trump.
[02:59:57.543 --> 02:59:59.124]  I mean, he goes, Trump made it up.
[02:59:59.204 --> 03:00:00.024]  The person threatened him.
[03:00:00.185 --> 03:00:05.448]  But they had a guy also in Nevada a few months ago with a gun saying he was coming to kill Trump.
[03:00:05.468 --> 03:00:06.289]  They go, oh, shut up.
[03:00:06.729 --> 03:00:11.232]  It's just like Trump says, the only person that can stop the corruption is you.
[03:00:12.653 --> 03:00:15.075]  And that's what a lot of members of Congress have said.
[03:00:15.135 --> 03:00:16.176]  I mean, this is just mounting.
[03:00:16.216 --> 03:00:16.636]  It's mounting.
[03:00:17.176 --> 03:00:18.517]  So we went live at 11 a.m.
[03:00:18.537 --> 03:00:18.918]  Central.
[03:00:20.238 --> 03:00:21.359]  So take 12 hours out of 52 hours.
[03:00:23.442 --> 03:00:30.287]  We basically have 40 hours left, right through tonight, right through tomorrow, all these big guests, right through Wednesday.
[03:00:30.307 --> 03:00:32.009]  I mean, wow.
[03:00:33.770 --> 03:00:37.353]  I have a certain peace knowing that Trump's winning, showing the statistics, the polls, the numbers.
[03:00:37.713 --> 03:00:43.198]  They have all the different feeds in case they take down one or the other at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:00:43.698 --> 03:00:50.544]  InfoWars.com forward slash election also has a bunch of leads and feeds, but I gotta tell you, Owen and McBreen, I mean,
[03:00:51.932 --> 03:00:53.613]  Listen, we're smart guys.
[03:00:54.014 --> 03:00:55.035]  We're going to do okay.
[03:00:56.516 --> 03:00:57.336]  No matter what happens.
[03:00:57.396 --> 03:01:04.482]  But Trump, I've never been for reparations because I didn't do anything, my family didn't do anything.
[03:01:04.542 --> 03:01:08.686]  But Trump says, hey, we'll cut taxes on black people even more.
[03:01:09.506 --> 03:01:12.929]  We'll have tax exemptions to build your neighborhoods.
[03:01:13.009 --> 03:01:13.630]  I'm all for that.
[03:01:14.588 --> 03:01:15.349]  I mean, imagine.
[03:01:15.409 --> 03:01:16.489]  He means it, by the way.
[03:01:16.849 --> 03:01:17.810]  It's been done in some cities.
[03:01:17.890 --> 03:01:20.232]  It's helped make folks that have been downtrodden rise up.
[03:01:20.652 --> 03:01:23.133]  I'm all for that, because their prosperity makes my prosperity better.
[03:01:23.554 --> 03:01:25.075]  I want to see them rich and prosperous.
[03:01:26.295 --> 03:01:34.361]  Under Obama and Hillary, black unemployment doubled because they want to keep them under their control, and we have the WikiLeaks admitting they want to keep them poor.
[03:01:34.381 --> 03:01:37.122]  They want to keep them on the Democratic plantation.
[03:01:37.423 --> 03:01:40.645]  That is such an asswipe, and I don't mean to make terms like that, but it is.
[03:01:41.365 --> 03:01:47.530]  To want to look at people like you own them and want to keep them poor so you run them.
[03:01:48.190 --> 03:01:51.433]  And that's why you have record low turnout for Hillary.
[03:01:51.453 --> 03:01:51.753]  Go ahead.
[03:01:51.893 --> 03:02:03.202]  Well, and that's that is so key, Alex, because if you break down these elections, if you go and look at the results, folks, the Democrats, they don't have populism ever.
[03:02:03.722 --> 03:02:07.505]  If you look at a voting map, you can go back years and years and years ago.
[03:02:07.585 --> 03:02:08.406]  It's the same thing.
[03:02:08.466 --> 03:02:09.987]  Pennsylvania, Missouri.
[03:02:10.487 --> 03:02:11.188]  Inner cities.
[03:02:11.428 --> 03:02:11.908]  That's it.
[03:02:12.249 --> 03:02:14.691]  The only blue places on the map are inner cities.
[03:02:14.931 --> 03:02:18.474]  If you broke down the whole map by counties, the whole map would be red.
[03:02:18.714 --> 03:02:19.915]  You wouldn't even find blue.
[03:02:20.475 --> 03:02:25.519]  And not that Republicans are perfect, but totally captive people are the Democrats voters.
[03:02:25.860 --> 03:02:26.941]  And they know this, Alex.
[03:02:27.061 --> 03:02:31.424]  They know that without the black vote in the inner cities, they don't have a chance.
[03:02:31.524 --> 03:02:38.270]  Without the people on the Democratic plantation in the inner cities voting them in every year, they have zero chance.
[03:02:38.370 --> 03:02:38.770]  That's right.
[03:02:38.851 --> 03:02:41.573]  I'm going to punch out and let you guys take over because a lot more is coming up.
[03:02:41.654 --> 03:02:44.457]  Just briefly, I skip breaks.
[03:02:44.737 --> 03:02:45.578]  I don't plug stuff.
[03:02:46.118 --> 03:02:46.939]  We don't fund ourselves.
[03:02:46.979 --> 03:02:49.061]  We're still doing good because you understand that and support us.
[03:02:49.662 --> 03:02:50.603]  We need to be refueled.
[03:02:50.763 --> 03:02:58.912]  We have the best non-GMO seeds, great Christmas presents with the best water filters, the best shower filters, the best books, the best films, the best nutraceuticals.
[03:03:00.017 --> 03:03:01.920]  It's all there at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:03:02.201 --> 03:03:05.005]  And we've got, this is about to sell out, it's limited edition.
[03:03:05.065 --> 03:03:06.067]  Trump is my president.
[03:03:06.087 --> 03:03:06.988]  We'll ship it out to you.
[03:03:07.009 --> 03:03:09.372]  Not in time for the election now, but a lot of folks have it.
[03:03:09.893 --> 03:03:11.316]  It's red shirts, wear them tomorrow.
[03:03:12.759 --> 03:03:13.820]  The other stuff's all sold out.
[03:03:13.860 --> 03:03:14.420]  That's at cost.
[03:03:14.460 --> 03:03:15.180]  It's about to sell out.

[03:04:09.016 --> 03:04:09.656]  And here we are.
[03:04:09.676 --> 03:04:12.058]  I'm not bragging, but who can tell you?
[03:04:12.098 --> 03:04:13.659]  They're more in the face of the enemy.
[03:04:13.939 --> 03:04:14.479]  Nobody is.
[03:04:14.739 --> 03:04:15.580]  Except for, like, Drudge.
[03:04:15.940 --> 03:04:17.121]  Drudge is on the same plane as us.
[03:04:17.181 --> 03:04:17.641]  Nobody else.
[03:04:18.621 --> 03:04:23.724]  Infowars is on a plane nobody else is on because we have the will to do everything.
[03:04:24.004 --> 03:04:25.525]  We have the will to take action.
[03:04:25.885 --> 03:04:26.065]  Right?
[03:04:26.085 --> 03:04:26.646]  March is great.
[03:04:26.686 --> 03:04:29.647]  Stephen Bannon is now driving the Trump train by Trump's winning.
[03:04:29.868 --> 03:04:30.448]  Populism.
[03:04:30.508 --> 03:04:31.168]  Nationalism.
[03:04:31.488 --> 03:04:32.049]  Common sense.
[03:04:33.530 --> 03:04:43.577]  I'll tell you, five days ago, just like in Star Wars, you use the allegory, the X-Wings have got the guns shooting at them, and all of a sudden the enemy fighters come and they go, the guns stop!
[03:04:44.857 --> 03:04:48.720]  Scan for enemy fighters, the guns have stopped, no more attack pieces.
[03:04:50.161 --> 03:04:51.822]  Let me illustrate that, I'm going to let the guys take over.
[03:04:53.103 --> 03:04:59.487]  Do you know what it's like to have a thousand newspapers a day attack you?
[03:05:01.297 --> 03:05:05.978]  That's some days, usually it's 200, 300, TV stations all over the country.
[03:05:06.099 --> 03:05:06.619]  I don't care.
[03:05:06.839 --> 03:05:07.699]  They're lying about me.
[03:05:07.919 --> 03:05:10.880]  I don't care what a bunch of scum do, allied with a bunch of pedophiles.
[03:05:11.560 --> 03:05:11.820]  Good.
[03:05:12.380 --> 03:05:12.881]  Thank God.
[03:05:12.941 --> 03:05:20.183]  But the point is, it's like to show how centralized it is and run by a central group.
[03:05:21.573 --> 03:05:22.334]  I wish it wasn't.
[03:05:22.394 --> 03:05:25.716]  I wish the attacks were still happening, because it wouldn't mean it was centralized.
[03:05:26.156 --> 03:05:36.203]  The lies, the deception, the false quotes, the fake racist quotes, you've never heard, you've never said them, all of it stopped five days ago.
[03:05:37.804 --> 03:05:38.605]  Because it all failed.
[03:05:39.746 --> 03:05:41.107]  And now it's silence.
[03:05:42.188 --> 03:05:44.649]  We've gone from, on average, 300, 400 articles, 20, 30 TV stations, or networks,
[03:05:49.975 --> 03:05:54.639]  Attacking me every day with lies to total silence five days ago.
[03:05:55.960 --> 03:06:11.654]  And you sit back, and you see one attack they put out, and you see Media Matters, MSNBC, and then a thousand newspapers hit you with lies, saying quotes you never said in a wall of fraud, in a wall of lies, in a wall of corruption.
[03:06:13.295 --> 03:06:16.318]  And you don't feel bad for yourself, you feel bad for them.
[03:06:18.479 --> 03:06:26.824]  Folks, if they started announcing they want to arrest us and put us in forced labor camps, the average trendy would kick your guts out and laugh about it.
[03:06:27.864 --> 03:06:28.525]  Here's the good news.
[03:06:29.105 --> 03:06:29.805]  We have founders.
[03:06:31.086 --> 03:06:35.589]  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Patrick Henry.
[03:06:36.989 --> 03:06:39.271]  And we're peaceful, loving men.
[03:06:39.291 --> 03:06:41.192]  We're not looking for trouble.
[03:06:42.131 --> 03:06:50.496]  So, if all these little chicken necks wanna physically fight us when we're kicking their butt in an info war, that's their choice.
[03:06:50.917 --> 03:06:54.699]  But we'll do everything we can to avert that.
[03:06:55.359 --> 03:06:55.880]  But man...
[03:06:56.846 --> 03:07:01.827]  They have articles out by the thousands before their guns stopped five days ago.
[03:07:01.847 --> 03:07:04.328]  I mean, I wrote stuff I've never seen.
[03:07:04.408 --> 03:07:10.829]  It was like, Jones says the National Guard is Nazis and want to kill you.
[03:07:10.849 --> 03:07:13.589]  And I'm like, there's no link, there's no quote.
[03:07:13.689 --> 03:07:14.450]  I never said that.
[03:07:15.510 --> 03:07:18.410]  Alex Jones hates Jews and black people.
[03:07:19.171 --> 03:07:20.291]  No link, no proof.
[03:07:23.507 --> 03:07:24.647]  David Koresh.
[03:07:24.667 --> 03:07:26.868]  That was in over 200 papers one day.
[03:07:27.328 --> 03:07:27.868]  No proof.
[03:07:28.469 --> 03:07:29.809]  I said David Koresh was a cult leader.
[03:07:30.169 --> 03:07:30.869]  Should have been arrested.
[03:07:30.889 --> 03:07:32.750]  Instead of burning down the church.
[03:07:32.810 --> 03:07:36.791]  I had the sheriff on 20 years ago to say we should have arrested him in town.
[03:07:36.811 --> 03:07:37.491]  He had a business.
[03:07:39.772 --> 03:07:46.574]  Again, the fact that they've had to go to that point is our victory.
[03:07:47.611 --> 03:07:49.833]  So whatever they do to me, I'm a man.
[03:07:50.454 --> 03:07:54.617]  I'm not sitting up here like I'm the biggest badass around, but you punch me, I'm gonna punch back.
[03:07:57.339 --> 03:08:02.724]  And I can sit back and tell you my family name is secured, and I've done the job I'm supposed to do.
[03:08:03.745 --> 03:08:05.667]  It's not some power trip, it's just who I am.
[03:08:07.262 --> 03:08:12.804]  I look at Stephanopoulos and all these sacks of shit sitting there telling us they're gonna leave the country.
[03:08:12.824 --> 03:08:14.124]  Listen, you son of a bitch!
[03:08:14.505 --> 03:08:17.686]  You're scared this country's gonna throw your carpet-bagging ass out.
[03:08:18.586 --> 03:08:20.927]  I see you, you little bloodthirsty maggot.
[03:08:22.047 --> 03:08:25.488]  Whatever happens to me, I just pray to God you get brought real low.
[03:08:26.709 --> 03:08:29.910]  Real low for what you've done, you little son of a bitch.
[03:08:31.550 --> 03:08:32.731]  So you understand one thing.
[03:08:33.311 --> 03:08:34.491]  There's a real world out there.
[03:08:34.511 --> 03:08:35.272]  There's a real God.
[03:08:35.312 --> 03:08:36.152]  There's a real devil.
[03:08:37.009 --> 03:08:39.750]  For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[03:08:41.010 --> 03:08:43.050]  And I want all the little men to know something.
[03:08:44.411 --> 03:08:46.371]  You were brought up as pieces of shit.
[03:08:47.691 --> 03:08:51.492]  And you thought you could dominate everybody because you were so insecure.
[03:08:52.292 --> 03:08:57.874]  And you thought people that were better than you were bad because they were better than you and they were building a stairway to heaven for you.
[03:08:58.894 --> 03:09:03.715]  And so now you've started fights with people that are going to break every bone in your body.
[03:09:05.046 --> 03:09:18.389]  So when you metaphysically have had your sternum broken and your ribs broken and your little neck strung up, you remember that you ran into real men and we kicked your ass.
[03:09:19.049 --> 03:09:20.169]  Now I'm done till tomorrow.
[03:09:20.429 --> 03:09:24.290]  I'm going to turn it over to Darren McBreen and Owen Schroyer, but make no mistake.
[03:09:24.970 --> 03:09:25.571]  This is real.
[03:09:26.151 --> 03:09:27.151]  This is the InfoWar.
[03:09:28.396 --> 03:09:29.096]  Amen to that.
[03:09:29.236 --> 03:09:33.098]  And let's remember what happened before the silence that Alex just talked about.
[03:09:33.158 --> 03:09:35.038]  They fired the Death Star at him.
[03:09:35.398 --> 03:09:37.959]  Hillary Clinton mentioning him multiple times.
[03:09:38.099 --> 03:09:41.040]  Obama mentioning the things that we talk about on the show.
[03:09:41.821 --> 03:09:42.901]  And then what happens, folks?
[03:09:42.961 --> 03:09:44.782]  The Death Star failed.
[03:09:45.642 --> 03:09:48.083]  And as Alex just said, we're not perfect.
[03:09:48.343 --> 03:09:50.324]  We might not be right all the time, but we're real.
[03:09:51.204 --> 03:09:53.525]  And at the end of the day, that's it.
[03:09:54.585 --> 03:09:59.366]  And these people that you see on the mainstream news are total sellouts, folks.
[03:09:59.846 --> 03:10:02.126]  They're greedy sacks of shit.
[03:10:02.787 --> 03:10:04.627]  Just like Alex said at the end of the day.
[03:10:05.087 --> 03:10:19.070]  They would sooner get their paycheck, get their fame, than actually get any real news out there, get any real information out there, or try to do anything in the general interest of this once great country that we will make great again.
[03:10:19.130 --> 03:10:19.650]  Derek McBrain.
[03:10:20.390 --> 03:10:29.936]  I just want to say that something I heard Donald Trump say recently, it was a couple weeks ago during one of his campaign stops, and he asked for everybody to pray for him.
[03:10:31.037 --> 03:10:33.279]  And he says, I'm praying for you, please pray for me.
[03:10:34.617 --> 03:10:45.162]  And he said, I thought this was remarkable, he ended by saying that he feels that the only chance he has to get to heaven is by becoming President of the United States.
[03:10:45.922 --> 03:10:49.184]  I think it says a lot about his heart and a lot about his mindset.
[03:10:49.864 --> 03:10:57.868]  He wants to do what's best for you, what's best for me, what's best for all of us, and what is best for the country, and I truly, truly believe that.
[03:10:59.212 --> 03:11:08.497]  And I do too, and I think that, again, the only reservation I think that's fair to have against Donald Trump is that he's the greatest PSYOP of all time, the greatest actor.
[03:11:08.537 --> 03:11:14.900]  It's not what I believe, it's not what I feel in my gut, it's not what the actions and the optics are to me, but that's the only reservation I'll hear.
[03:11:15.121 --> 03:11:17.122]  Maybe he's the greatest PSYOP, greatest actor of all time.
[03:11:17.582 --> 03:11:19.023]  Anything else, I'm not hearing it.
[03:11:19.083 --> 03:11:22.665]  Hillary Clinton supporters, give me a break.
[03:11:22.705 --> 03:11:26.867]  We know what to expect with Hillary Clinton, the most corrupt
[03:11:27.407 --> 03:11:30.008]  It'll be the most corrupt administration from the very beginning.
[03:11:30.168 --> 03:11:31.848]  From the very get-go.
[03:11:31.988 --> 03:11:33.529]  We know what to expect from her.
[03:11:33.669 --> 03:11:34.869]  Absolute corruption.
[03:11:35.029 --> 03:11:40.111]  It's going to be wild because whoever gets into office is going to be the most hated president as soon as they get in.
[03:11:40.151 --> 03:11:44.212]  But I think with time Donald Trump could go down as one of the greatest if he gets the chance.
[03:11:44.432 --> 03:11:45.032]  I think so too.
[03:11:45.932 --> 03:11:49.834]  Alright, so, guys, do we have Jack Posobiec ready to go?
[03:11:51.955 --> 03:11:52.735]  Jack is ready to go.
[03:11:52.755 --> 03:11:54.276]  Alright, well, let's go to Jack Posobiec.
[03:11:54.336 --> 03:11:59.138]  He is the Special Operations Director for Citizens for Trump, and he's been a great guest.
[03:11:59.198 --> 03:12:00.159]  I love talking to Jack.
[03:12:00.179 --> 03:12:01.059]  Very informative.
[03:12:01.819 --> 03:12:07.322]  He has a lot of good intel as far as what's going on with the election right now.
[03:12:07.382 --> 03:12:08.823]  Let me just guarantee you that.
[03:12:09.463 --> 03:12:10.684]  Let's go ahead and go to Jack.
[03:12:10.724 --> 03:12:11.384]  Jack, can you hear me?
[03:12:12.284 --> 03:12:12.905]  There he is!
[03:12:12.945 --> 03:12:13.645]  How's it going?
[03:12:14.639 --> 03:12:21.286]  Well, you know, there seems to be a lot of high energy, a lot of good energy coming out of the Trump camp right now.
[03:12:21.726 --> 03:12:23.108]  What are your feelings right now?
[03:12:23.808 --> 03:12:26.151]  Well, Owen, you should have seen some of the energy we had tonight.
[03:12:26.211 --> 03:12:32.037]  So myself and a group of people, I'm located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for today and tomorrow.
[03:12:32.057 --> 03:12:34.760]  I'm going to be on the ground here looking for fraud, looking for cheating.
[03:12:36.934 --> 03:12:38.075]  A bunch of us went down.
[03:12:38.115 --> 03:12:40.636]  Hillary Clinton had her final rally tonight.
[03:12:40.676 --> 03:12:43.677]  So all of the Clintons and all of the Obamas were there.
[03:12:44.157 --> 03:12:49.560]  Myself and about 50 of my closest Trump friends, supporters all went down and crashed the entire place.
[03:12:51.100 --> 03:12:53.921]  Now you guys did a, uh, it was a Trump flash mob, right?
[03:12:54.662 --> 03:12:55.242]  Exactly.
[03:12:55.322 --> 03:12:57.223]  So no, nobody from the campaign was there.
[03:12:57.383 --> 03:13:03.246]  Totally organic, right in the heart, the belly of the beast, uh, liberal Philadelphia.
[03:13:03.326 --> 03:13:06.067]  And I got to tell you, there were so many people that saw us.
[03:13:07.066 --> 03:13:09.107]  And they were scared to come over to us.
[03:13:09.567 --> 03:13:12.747]  They would scream and walk away or they would like avert their eyes.
[03:13:12.767 --> 03:13:20.089]  I gotta tell you, but nobody, nobody was telling me like, oh, you should vote for Hillary because she's good.
[03:13:20.309 --> 03:13:22.230]  You know, it's all just, we hate you.
[03:13:22.850 --> 03:13:25.251]  Or don't vote for Trump because he is so bad.
[03:13:25.271 --> 03:13:30.872]  Yeah, I gotta tell you, it's, it's, I've worked a lot of elections in the past and that whole
[03:13:31.363 --> 03:13:36.345]  That whole we dislike your opponent and negative vote thing, it's not enough to win an election.
[03:13:36.425 --> 03:13:44.629]  You still need a core group of voters that are supportive of the candidate to push them over the finish line.
[03:13:45.222 --> 03:13:52.484]  Now, to me, based on what I saw, this was the most people Hillary has ever had an event, by far.
[03:13:52.965 --> 03:13:54.045]  Not even close.
[03:13:54.405 --> 03:13:55.806]  And you were actually on the ground.
[03:13:56.046 --> 03:14:02.088]  It looked like she actually might have had about 10,000 people in that field area.
[03:14:02.128 --> 03:14:03.328]  What do you say?
[03:14:03.648 --> 03:14:09.250]  Let me break that down for you, man, because these people were not there for Hillary Clinton or any of them.
[03:14:09.830 --> 03:14:11.791]  So, here's who it was.
[03:14:12.664 --> 03:14:22.294]  It was a concert billed with Bon Jovi and Bruce Springsteen and Philadelphia is a very short bridge ride over
[03:14:22.725 --> 03:14:28.146]  From New Jersey, you've got Toronto, you've got Trenton, and you've got Camden that are right there.
[03:14:28.666 --> 03:14:31.827]  All the license plates I saw in these cars were from Jersey.
[03:14:32.147 --> 03:14:35.808]  None of the people were actually from Philadelphia where she was trying to get out the boat.
[03:14:36.168 --> 03:14:42.689]  So politically it was a complete failure for her because all these Jersey people came over because they wanted to see Bruce Springsteen.
[03:14:43.289 --> 03:14:45.610]  They came out for a rock concert, that was all.
[03:14:46.533 --> 03:14:51.194]  And we talked to people afterwards and they said, well, yeah, you know, we're not really for her.
[03:14:51.274 --> 03:14:51.855]  We don't care.
[03:14:51.935 --> 03:14:53.435]  We just wanted to see you, Springsteen.
[03:14:53.455 --> 03:14:54.616]  And that's about it.
[03:14:55.216 --> 03:15:02.838]  And we had similar stories of people coming out of the Jay-Z Hillary event saying, oh, we don't we don't care about Hillary.
[03:15:02.878 --> 03:15:04.539]  I just want to see Jay-Z.
[03:15:04.699 --> 03:15:06.859]  So thanks for bringing Jay-Z here, Hillary.
[03:15:07.059 --> 03:15:07.960]  But we still hate you.
[03:15:09.120 --> 03:15:15.122]  Now, the crazy thing about it was now I was on the ground and I hadn't yet seen the video of Hillary
[03:15:16.437 --> 03:15:21.660]  Having her mini-seizure walking down the steps, or maybe she was, uh, throwing a few back tonight.
[03:15:21.700 --> 03:15:22.741]  I don't know what that was.
[03:15:23.121 --> 03:15:26.263]  If you guys want to pull that video up, Jennifer Epstein on Twitter.
[03:15:26.323 --> 03:15:26.923]  Go ahead, Jack.
[03:15:27.644 --> 03:15:37.550]  And I am apoplectic as how Jennifer Epstein, a Bloomberg reporter, would post a video like that, knowing how terrible it makes her candidate look.
[03:15:37.670 --> 03:15:39.331]  Well, this is how dumb they are, Jack!
[03:15:39.511 --> 03:15:40.592]  This is how dumb they are!
[03:15:40.932 --> 03:15:42.133]  She tweets the video,
[03:15:42.873 --> 03:15:49.278]  And she thinks that she's got some sort of like a, you know, she's got the, she was there, she's cool, she's got the inside video.
[03:15:49.638 --> 03:15:52.440]  She's got the video of Hillary Clinton arriving and greeting Bill Clinton.
[03:15:52.681 --> 03:15:53.882]  Yay, I'm the establishment.
[03:15:53.942 --> 03:15:55.083]  Yay, I got the access.
[03:15:55.363 --> 03:16:01.688]  And she's so stupid, she doesn't even realize that we just caught her candidate either drunk or having a seizure.
[03:16:02.768 --> 03:16:07.332]  And it's to her, it's like, these people live inside of an echo chamber.
[03:16:07.972 --> 03:16:09.834]  They live inside of a bubble.
[03:16:10.333 --> 03:16:14.377]  You know, we heard people today coming up to us and say, Oh, Trump supporters.
[03:16:14.537 --> 03:16:16.980]  I've never seen them in person before.
[03:16:17.761 --> 03:16:19.923]  I've never seen them in person.
[03:16:19.963 --> 03:16:21.845]  I mean, break that kind of statement down.
[03:16:22.225 --> 03:16:29.493]  It's as if we're some fictional amorphous thing that exists on in television and in a different reality from them.
[03:16:30.314 --> 03:16:30.474]  And
[03:16:31.801 --> 03:16:32.782]  No, we're right here.
[03:16:32.882 --> 03:16:37.724]  You can see us on TV, you can see us on all this stuff, because they don't watch the stuff we watch.
[03:16:38.245 --> 03:16:43.748]  I really have been breaking this down a lot, and it's almost like we live in two realities at this point.
[03:16:44.048 --> 03:16:54.034]  There's the reality of people who are on the ground, going to these things, you guys are reporting it, social media is reporting it, and then there's the false reality that's being pushed out.
[03:16:54.874 --> 03:16:59.957]  Alex likes to refer to it as being inside the Matrix, and I think that's an apt analogy.
[03:17:00.410 --> 03:17:04.195]  Because they're looking at these news stories that are false.
[03:17:04.235 --> 03:17:06.417]  They're looking at these poll numbers that are false.
[03:17:06.437 --> 03:17:08.420]  They're looking at these Hillary rallies that are false.
[03:17:08.780 --> 03:17:10.322]  They're billing it as a Hillary rally.
[03:17:10.342 --> 03:17:13.285]  You know, like you said, there's, oh, 10,000 people for Hillary.
[03:17:13.366 --> 03:17:13.566]  No!
[03:17:13.586 --> 03:17:15.668]  These people came for a rock and roll concert.
[03:17:15.688 --> 03:17:16.109]  It's Philly.
[03:17:16.129 --> 03:17:16.950]  We love rock and roll.
[03:17:17.551 --> 03:17:19.192]  There are so many illustrations here.
[03:17:19.533 --> 03:17:28.519]  One, how the Democrats love to use psyops and trick people into a false narrative where, oh, look at all these people we had!
[03:17:28.540 --> 03:17:29.320]  It's so amazing!
[03:17:29.400 --> 03:17:31.702]  But no, they came for a rock concert, okay?
[03:17:31.942 --> 03:17:36.686]  That's like Hillary shows up at a baseball game and says, ooh, look at all my supporters!
[03:17:36.726 --> 03:17:38.467]  No, they came to see a baseball game.
[03:17:38.787 --> 03:17:41.550]  But what you talked about there was so perfect, Jack.
[03:17:42.574 --> 03:17:46.215]  There's the reality, and then there's the TV reality.
[03:17:46.876 --> 03:17:50.837]  There's the real world, and then there's the TV world.
[03:17:50.917 --> 03:17:52.157]  And here's what I mean by this, folks.
[03:17:52.558 --> 03:17:55.879]  Just like what Jack just said, I've never seen a Trump supporter.
[03:17:55.939 --> 03:17:57.419]  Oh my gosh, like it's some sort of illusion.
[03:17:57.819 --> 03:17:58.980]  There's millions of us.
[03:18:00.461 --> 03:18:09.169]  When I go out and I say Trump or I say something bad about Hillary, I immediately have Trump supporters chirping at me from all different angles like, oh Trump, Trump, make America great again, Trump, Hillary for President.
[03:18:09.570 --> 03:18:10.551]  So we're definitely out there.
[03:18:10.831 --> 03:18:16.636]  But they're so engulfed in the TV fake reality, that's their reality!
[03:18:16.937 --> 03:18:22.262]  So if the TV says Trump supporters don't exist, if the TV says that Trump is a racist, then there you go!
[03:18:22.482 --> 03:18:23.343]  That's their reality!
[03:18:23.583 --> 03:18:24.123]  Point blank!
[03:18:25.387 --> 03:18:35.754]  There is an infamous New York Times column from back in the 60s, I believe it was 68, where the title of it was, no one I know voted for Nixon.
[03:18:35.774 --> 03:18:41.779]  That's how it's going to be, but the funny thing is, it's going to be for Hillary.
[03:18:42.904 --> 03:18:45.425]  I don't know that many people.
[03:18:45.445 --> 03:19:04.674]  This Newsweek, this false Newsweek cover that people are talking about where they already, you know, Madam President, that's going to be like the Dewey beats Truman newspaper headline, the famous one that, you know, these things are being printed up, but it's like the Super Bowl stuff that they print for the champions, you know, the guys that lose, you know, this, this is not going to be a winning election for her.
[03:19:04.694 --> 03:19:10.457]  And talking about on the ground stuff, I'm receiving information now from a lot of sources
[03:19:11.156 --> 03:19:14.660]  People that are on the ground in Philadelphia, people that are on the ground across the states.
[03:19:15.561 --> 03:19:25.854]  We will know so much about what's going on in Pennsylvania that I will probably know more about this election by noon tomorrow than almost anyone in the country.
[03:19:26.425 --> 03:19:33.910]  Well that's good to know, as far as I'm concerned, because I don't want to trust the fake TV reality to give me the honest results.
[03:19:34.330 --> 03:19:35.731]  But let's just get into that.
[03:19:35.751 --> 03:19:43.917]  I know you've got a bunch of intel you can't share it all on the air, but just where, as a Trump supporter, where are your emotions right now?
[03:19:43.977 --> 03:19:48.860]  Where are you feeling Trump actually is right now, entering election eve?
[03:19:50.181 --> 03:19:52.523]  Donald Trump is in a very good position right now.
[03:19:53.564 --> 03:19:55.165]  And there's two things to that.
[03:19:56.107 --> 03:20:02.791]  He is ahead by several points in national polls, and he's very close or slightly ahead in the swing states.
[03:20:03.652 --> 03:20:12.658]  So for a Republican, for the onslaught that he's received in the mainstream media and the national press, this is an amazing position for him to be in.
[03:20:13.198 --> 03:20:17.401]  Any other Republican candidate would be 10, 20 points behind right now.
[03:20:17.501 --> 03:20:19.823]  Something egregious that would be insurmountable.
[03:20:20.303 --> 03:20:22.244]  Only Donald Trump could have withstood this.
[03:20:22.264 --> 03:20:24.946]  So to be in that spot is very good.
[03:20:25.467 --> 03:20:25.967]  Number one.
[03:20:26.604 --> 03:20:38.747]  Number two, with the FBI's refusal to enforce the law yet again yesterday, it gives Donald Trump supporters something new to be motivated about.
[03:20:39.147 --> 03:20:54.951]  A new step in the case, a new turn, a new realization, and really pressing the button again of reminding them that this is the type of thing that Donald Trump is running to defeat and to correct in the first place.
[03:20:55.495 --> 03:21:06.477]  This corruption, these games, these pay-for-plays, these things that people are, you know, completely taken off the hook when we know that a law has been broken.
[03:21:06.517 --> 03:21:16.299]  We know there's no way that they can review 650,000 emails in, you know, in one week or five days or whatever it was even, and people are sick of it.
[03:21:16.359 --> 03:21:24.320]  So that motivation combined with the general enthusiasm gap between Trump supporters and Hillary supporters
[03:21:24.807 --> 03:21:27.832]  We'll be enough to defeat that going into it.
[03:21:28.153 --> 03:21:36.467]  The issue that we see as being most challenging for Trump right now is going to be the issue of Democrat voter fraud.
[03:21:37.955 --> 03:21:50.022]  And that is what we've basically been saying this whole time, and I know you've got your eye on it, Roger Stone has his eye on it, and hopefully millions of Americans at the polling place will also have their eye on it.
[03:21:50.062 --> 03:21:52.663]  Jack Posobiec, Citizens for Trump, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:21:52.964 --> 03:21:56.846]  We're gonna get you, I'm gonna get you back on again before we finish this broadcast, alright my friend?
[03:21:57.534 --> 03:21:57.854]  We'll be on.
[03:21:57.874 --> 03:21:59.916]  I'll have lots of intel to share tomorrow, my friend.
[03:21:59.976 --> 03:22:01.417]  I know you're not going to sleep tonight.
[03:22:01.977 --> 03:22:03.798]  You're on mega energy three times.
[03:22:04.459 --> 03:22:06.460]  This is, yeah, I wish I'd had some brain force.
[03:22:06.480 --> 03:22:10.623]  You know, Maggie said she was going to send me some brain force, but I don't know, maybe I'm traveling around too much.
[03:22:10.683 --> 03:22:11.424]  I must have missed it.
[03:22:13.185 --> 03:22:13.605]  What's up?
[03:22:13.625 --> 03:22:15.127]  We got to get this guy some brain force.
[03:22:15.147 --> 03:22:18.289]  We just actually released the new brain force.
[03:22:18.309 --> 03:22:20.851]  You get 36 capsules now instead of 30.
[03:22:21.811 --> 03:22:22.712]  As if we didn't give you enough.
[03:22:22.732 --> 03:22:23.032]  I need all 36.
[03:22:23.072 --> 03:22:23.372]  I need all 36.
[03:22:26.308 --> 03:22:28.088]  Well, thank you, Jack, and thank you for that plug.
[03:22:28.108 --> 03:22:29.889]  We're gonna get you some Brain Force.
[03:22:29.929 --> 03:22:30.989]  I don't think you need it, brother.
[03:22:31.129 --> 03:22:32.530]  I don't think you need it, to be honest.
[03:22:32.570 --> 03:22:34.250]  You're kicking some serious ass.
[03:22:34.810 --> 03:22:37.551]  If I was on Brain Force right now, Hillary wouldn't even be in the race.
[03:22:37.571 --> 03:22:38.871]  She would have dropped out long ago.
[03:22:39.471 --> 03:22:41.072]  Somebody get this man some Brain Force.
[03:22:41.092 --> 03:22:42.352]  Alright, Jack, thank you so much.
[03:22:42.372 --> 03:22:43.433]  We'll talk to you again soon, friend.
[03:22:43.713 --> 03:22:45.033]  Alright, just make sure she doesn't get any.
[03:22:45.913 --> 03:22:47.774]  Well, I mean, you know, I don't even know if it would help her.
[03:22:48.154 --> 03:22:51.997]  I feel like, I actually wanted to do this as, uh, we salute Jack as he leaves us.
[03:22:52.097 --> 03:23:00.783]  I actually wanted to do this, um, as kind of like, maybe I can still do this, if Hillary loses it won't be as powerful, but basically an ad, like, you know, Hillary,
[03:23:01.684 --> 03:23:04.026]  We've heard that you have some serious health problems.
[03:23:04.086 --> 03:23:05.227]  You know, we're caring people.
[03:23:05.587 --> 03:23:06.148]  We really are.
[03:23:06.868 --> 03:23:07.549]  We care about you.
[03:23:07.589 --> 03:23:09.550]  We feel bad that you've had all these health issues.
[03:23:10.271 --> 03:23:13.413]  We feel bad that, you know, you can't even get off of a plane.
[03:23:13.773 --> 03:23:16.916]  You can't even get into a car without somebody helping you.
[03:23:16.936 --> 03:23:18.197]  I mean, these are serious issues.
[03:23:19.678 --> 03:23:20.759]  And we want to help you, Hillary.
[03:23:21.279 --> 03:23:22.881]  We've got super female vitality.
[03:23:23.161 --> 03:23:27.284]  You know, you're a bit of an old maid.
[03:23:27.304 --> 03:23:29.646]  I imagine that your bones are a little sore.
[03:23:29.786 --> 03:23:30.767]  We've got some bone support.
[03:23:31.795 --> 03:23:43.741]  So, you know, next time when you go completely limp, next time when you pass out and fall down and almost die, you know, you can have your stronger kneecap or a stronger hip.
[03:23:44.682 --> 03:23:50.225]  You know, maybe next time you fall and hit your head, you take some bone support formula and you can have a stronger skull.
[03:23:51.125 --> 03:23:53.827]  And then maybe you won't get that concussion, Hillary.
[03:23:55.194 --> 03:23:57.495]  But the truth of the matter is, folks, these products are no joke.
[03:23:57.815 --> 03:23:58.936]  I am a user myself.
[03:23:59.996 --> 03:24:05.319]  I'm yet to use an InfoWars product that I didn't want to use again.
[03:24:05.339 --> 03:24:07.580]  And that's when you know it's good.
[03:24:07.740 --> 03:24:10.502]  So InfoWarsStore.com, that's how we're able to do this broadcast.
[03:24:10.662 --> 03:24:16.765]  That's how Alex is able to hire people like me and the great crew back there that is helping me get on air.
[03:24:16.785 --> 03:24:20.006]  And in fact, do we have Elizabeth ready to go, guys?
[03:24:22.667 --> 03:24:22.928]  What's that?
[03:24:22.948 --> 03:24:23.588]  I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
[03:24:25.069 --> 03:24:25.349]  Okay.
[03:24:25.929 --> 03:24:26.549]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[03:24:27.670 --> 03:24:28.130]  I'll say this.
[03:24:28.150 --> 03:24:51.915]  While they're getting Elizabeth ready to go, I've been wondering what I can do, what I can say, how I can infiltrate people's own mind, their own thought process, how I can manipulate their own logic against their own fake reality.
[03:24:52.395 --> 03:24:52.775]  Because
[03:24:54.013 --> 03:24:59.477]  I've always felt the reason why people have liked listening to my broadcast is because I'm real.
[03:25:01.078 --> 03:25:02.079]  They can relate to me.
[03:25:02.119 --> 03:25:04.320]  They feel like they're talking to someone they're friends with.
[03:25:04.340 --> 03:25:07.162]  They feel like they're talking to someone they can relate to.
[03:25:07.963 --> 03:25:14.947]  And I feel like there's something that all Americans should relate to.
[03:25:15.087 --> 03:25:19.971]  I don't know if they can, but all Americans should be able to relate to a few things.
[03:25:20.251 --> 03:25:21.292]  And so this is kind of...
[03:25:22.423 --> 03:25:33.849]  What I ask nonpartisan to try to enlighten people about where their vote should go in this election.
[03:25:34.849 --> 03:25:44.494]  And I simply have four questions, and I'm curious, maybe the listeners can add to this, maybe they can tell me whether they think this is effective or not, but here's what I say.
[03:25:45.435 --> 03:25:51.358]  Nonpartisan to any undecided voter, or a Hillary Clinton voter, or a Donald Trump voter, anybody, all voters.
[03:25:52.959 --> 03:25:54.840]  Is the government corrupt?
[03:25:56.481 --> 03:26:00.043]  Now, who wouldn't say yes to that, right?
[03:26:01.043 --> 03:26:03.545]  I mean, that should be a yes across all spectrums.
[03:26:03.845 --> 03:26:12.530]  Of course, what we've seen, because Hillary is so corrupt, these Hillary Clinton supporters have to lie to themselves, folks.
[03:26:12.970 --> 03:26:15.971]  They have to lie to themselves and they can't admit the government is corrupt.
[03:26:16.171 --> 03:26:18.613]  Because they know if they admit that, then they can't vote for Hillary.
[03:26:19.577 --> 03:26:24.580]  It's amazing, this is the brainwashing we're dealing with, where people can't admit the reality because it means they have to act.
[03:26:24.941 --> 03:26:26.242]  But is the government corrupt?
[03:26:27.082 --> 03:26:27.983]  Would be the first question.
[03:26:28.223 --> 03:26:30.264]  Anyone who wouldn't lie to themselves would say yes.
[03:26:31.465 --> 03:26:35.188]  And naturally the follow-up question, do we need a change?
[03:26:36.249 --> 03:26:44.411]  I don't know any right-thinking American, as in logical thinking, common-sense thinking American, who lives in reality, who would not say yes to those two questions.
[03:26:44.531 --> 03:26:45.191]  Non-partisan.
[03:26:45.751 --> 03:26:46.711]  Is the government corrupt?
[03:26:47.051 --> 03:26:47.891]  Does it need a change?
[03:26:48.191 --> 03:26:49.972]  That is a yes, yes.
[03:26:50.732 --> 03:26:53.612]  That should be the easiest test you've ever taken in your life.
[03:26:54.692 --> 03:26:59.773]  So then, I follow that up and I say, which candidate is from the government?
[03:27:02.434 --> 03:27:03.094]  Hillary Clinton.
[03:27:04.961 --> 03:27:07.502]  Which candidate represents a change?
[03:27:08.782 --> 03:27:10.002]  Donald Trump.
[03:27:11.243 --> 03:27:20.706]  So you see, based on this circle of questioning and logic, there should be no Hillary Clinton supporters, folks.
[03:27:21.786 --> 03:27:28.868]  Unless you are willing to lie to yourself and say the government is not corrupt and that this country doesn't need a change.
[03:27:29.168 --> 03:27:32.789]  Unless you are willing to lie to yourself, that's essentially what you're doing.
[03:27:34.693 --> 03:27:39.717]  If you answer this series of questions honestly and still think Hillary Clinton is your candidate.
[03:27:40.577 --> 03:27:41.498]  At least that's how I feel.
[03:27:41.598 --> 03:27:42.359]  Is the government corrupt?
[03:27:42.619 --> 03:27:42.859]  Yes.
[03:27:43.379 --> 03:27:44.380]  Does this country need a change?
[03:27:44.780 --> 03:27:45.020]  Yes.
[03:27:45.421 --> 03:27:46.542]  Which candidate is from the government?
[03:27:46.842 --> 03:27:47.162]  Clinton.
[03:27:47.522 --> 03:27:48.663]  Which candidate represents a change?
[03:27:48.983 --> 03:27:49.264]  Trump.
[03:27:50.084 --> 03:27:50.785]  Non-partisan?
[03:27:52.082 --> 03:27:52.843]  Not confusing.
[03:27:53.683 --> 03:27:54.284]  Very simple.
[03:27:54.304 --> 03:27:56.365]  Of course, there are a lot of issues to get into this.
[03:27:56.405 --> 03:27:58.466]  If you talk policy, Trump still beats her there, too.
[03:27:58.827 --> 03:28:00.288]  He completely trumps her across the board.
[03:28:01.188 --> 03:28:07.452]  But, again, most Americans can't really think that in depth, so we try to break it down on a simpler scale.
[03:28:08.233 --> 03:28:10.374]  What is the current status right now on Elizabeth, guys?
[03:28:15.017 --> 03:28:16.238]  Okay, so I'll tell you what.
[03:28:16.278 --> 03:28:18.300]  Why don't we roll this video
[03:28:19.662 --> 03:28:22.704]  This might be a video that can convince some people not to vote for Hillary.
[03:28:23.064 --> 03:28:26.005]  Do we have the What Difference Does It Make Remix ready to go, guys?
[03:28:26.926 --> 03:28:28.687]  Okay, let's go ahead and let's roll that video.
[03:28:28.707 --> 03:28:30.507]  This is a video of Hillary Clinton.
[03:28:30.527 --> 03:28:31.848]  This is a classic video, folks.
[03:28:31.868 --> 03:28:33.169]  Hillary, James Comey.
[03:28:33.409 --> 03:28:35.430]  This is the true essence of these people.
[03:28:35.530 --> 03:28:37.291]  Total frauds, total shills.
[03:28:37.611 --> 03:28:40.012]  How could you vote or for support for these people?
[03:28:40.352 --> 03:28:41.373]  This is a classic video.
[03:28:41.433 --> 03:28:42.894]  What Difference Does It Make Remix?
[03:28:42.914 --> 03:28:43.534]  Let's go ahead.
[03:28:54.173 --> 03:28:59.096]  Good morning, I'm here to give you an update on the FBI's investigation of Secretary Clinton.
[03:28:59.317 --> 03:29:01.818]  What I want to do is tell you what we're recommending.
[03:29:01.998 --> 03:29:05.280]  But first, let me tell you what we found.
[03:29:05.300 --> 03:29:11.444]  110 emails in 52 email chains have been determined to contain classified information.
[03:29:11.464 --> 03:29:14.186]  What difference at this point does it make?
[03:29:14.246 --> 03:29:16.348]  Many of those chains are top secret.
[03:29:21.608 --> 03:29:22.328]  We're good.
[03:29:41.184 --> 03:29:41.885]  We're good to go.
[03:30:14.113 --> 03:30:15.794]  We're good to go.
[03:30:39.269 --> 03:30:41.290]  What difference does it make?
[03:31:22.611 --> 03:31:23.492]  So there you go, folks.
[03:31:23.612 --> 03:31:27.995]  James Comey pretty much indicts Hillary Clinton with his speech.
[03:31:28.675 --> 03:31:29.476]  She broke the law.
[03:31:30.256 --> 03:31:31.497]  She had classified emails.
[03:31:32.297 --> 03:31:33.478]  She lied about it.
[03:31:34.299 --> 03:31:36.540]  And yet, she gets away with it.
[03:31:37.421 --> 03:31:51.210]  And I just don't understand how any American citizen doesn't become infuriated knowing that Hillary Clinton is above the law.
[03:31:53.243 --> 03:31:58.789]  And, you know, we're talking about a private email server, okay?
[03:31:58.909 --> 03:32:02.413]  We're talking about Hillary Clinton lying under oath.
[03:32:02.753 --> 03:32:03.674]  Now, you know...
[03:32:05.154 --> 03:32:06.215]  She'll play the whole card.
[03:32:06.275 --> 03:32:07.475]  She didn't know any better.
[03:32:07.535 --> 03:32:08.716]  She didn't have any intent.
[03:32:09.216 --> 03:32:18.342]  They admit, you know, she's perfectly healthy, but then when she can't remember any of this during an investigation, all of a sudden she has brain and memory issues.
[03:32:18.602 --> 03:32:29.589]  Remember, she's perfectly healthy when Alex Jones questions her health, but when the FBI questions her on emails, she has mental disorders and memory problems.
[03:32:30.029 --> 03:32:31.050]  You know, those concussions.
[03:32:31.909 --> 03:32:37.673]  So, you know, again, just more total hypocrisy, more double standards, blatant lies out of the Clinton camp.
[03:32:38.154 --> 03:32:47.120]  But I don't understand how any American citizen does not become infuriated with the fact that she is truly above the law, folks, okay?
[03:32:47.601 --> 03:32:53.365]  If you get pulled over for speeding and you tell the officer, well, I didn't, I wasn't intending to speed.
[03:32:53.845 --> 03:32:54.766]  Is he going to let you off?
[03:32:56.960 --> 03:33:00.023]  If you get, I mean, it's just, like, this is so common sense.
[03:33:00.063 --> 03:33:05.047]  I can't even believe I have to come on air and actually break this down for brainwashed morons.
[03:33:09.281 --> 03:33:10.982]  So that's why the cops never wrote me a ticket.
[03:33:11.543 --> 03:33:13.805]  Oh wait, that's the exact opposite of what happened to me.
[03:33:14.165 --> 03:33:16.447]  But nonetheless, but that's why I'm so pissed off!
[03:33:16.907 --> 03:33:19.369]  It's because I've suffered the extent of the law!
[03:33:20.010 --> 03:33:23.073]  When I broke the law, I had to pay my dues!
[03:33:23.673 --> 03:33:24.214]  Literally!
[03:33:24.914 --> 03:33:25.675]  It's not cheap!
[03:33:26.515 --> 03:33:30.239]  And Hillary Clinton gets to fly around the whole world on a jet!
[03:33:31.294 --> 03:33:41.467]  Paid for by her money laundering foundation, and then she gets away with breaking the law, lying under oath, and gets to run for president.
[03:33:41.668 --> 03:33:44.571]  I'm sorry, I'm getting really ticked off actually talking about this.
[03:33:48.086 --> 03:33:50.727]  What is it going to take to wake America up, folks?
[03:33:50.747 --> 03:33:51.147]  You know what?
[03:33:51.207 --> 03:33:53.988]  I'm sitting here, I'm all pissed off because I'm buying into the propaganda.
[03:33:54.409 --> 03:33:55.429]  She's lost!
[03:33:56.209 --> 03:33:57.070]  She's dead!
[03:33:57.090 --> 03:33:59.451]  This is a dead candidate!
[03:33:59.651 --> 03:34:01.231]  This candidate has no support!
[03:34:01.532 --> 03:34:06.494]  The only places where you find Hillary Clinton supporters are on the brainwashed liberal campuses!
[03:34:07.014 --> 03:34:07.654]  That's it!
[03:34:08.094 --> 03:34:09.175]  I've traveled around!
[03:34:09.455 --> 03:34:10.575]  I've followed this election!
[03:34:10.635 --> 03:34:11.456]  I went to the debates!
[03:34:11.516 --> 03:34:12.356]  I went to the rallies!
[03:34:12.416 --> 03:34:12.976]  I've gone around!
[03:34:13.036 --> 03:34:13.937]  I've done man-on-the-streets!
[03:34:14.137 --> 03:34:15.317]  I've done exit polls, folks!
[03:34:15.637 --> 03:34:17.098]  There is no Clinton support!
[03:34:21.107 --> 03:34:22.229]  I'm sorry, I'm corrected.
[03:34:23.250 --> 03:34:23.971]  Was that Marcos?
[03:34:26.115 --> 03:34:30.221]  We got... We got such a great staff back there.
[03:34:30.261 --> 03:34:33.626]  We got Marcos, we got Joe, Daria, everybody back there doing a great job.
[03:34:34.808 --> 03:34:35.770]  But I stand corrected.
[03:34:36.195 --> 03:34:37.696]  The dead still vote for Hillary.
[03:34:37.816 --> 03:34:38.697]  I stand corrected.
[03:34:39.097 --> 03:34:42.200]  Hillary has the support of the dead vote.
[03:34:42.780 --> 03:34:45.202]  And she also has the support of the illegal vote.
[03:34:45.222 --> 03:34:47.163]  She also has the people who vote in two states.
[03:34:48.384 --> 03:34:49.545]  So I stand corrected.
[03:34:49.645 --> 03:34:56.851]  But of the alive Americans who are actual registered voters, Hillary Clinton is basically getting her ass kicked.
[03:34:56.871 --> 03:34:58.352]  What's the current status on Elizabeth, guys?
[03:35:02.119 --> 03:35:02.579]  Wonderful.
[03:35:02.619 --> 03:35:03.779]  So we're getting her worked on.
[03:35:03.839 --> 03:35:06.720]  I'm joined by the lovely Leanne McAdoo in studio.
[03:35:06.760 --> 03:35:11.761]  Leanne, you just saw me get all ticked off with the fact Hillary Clinton is running for president.
[03:35:11.801 --> 03:35:13.582]  Give me a minute to just kind of cool down.
[03:35:13.702 --> 03:35:14.282]  Calm down, yeah.
[03:35:14.322 --> 03:35:16.323]  I know you have election stress disorder.
[03:35:16.343 --> 03:35:17.303]  Yes.
[03:35:17.343 --> 03:35:20.944]  I'm sure you're all exasperated by the thought that Hillary Clinton is going to win.
[03:35:21.044 --> 03:35:22.684]  I just want to see that bitch in jail!
[03:35:22.944 --> 03:35:24.645]  I want to see that bitch in jail!
[03:35:24.885 --> 03:35:25.725]  I cannot rest
[03:35:25.965 --> 03:35:27.626]  Until that bitch is in jail!
[03:35:27.826 --> 03:35:29.087]  I don't have election fatigue!
[03:35:29.327 --> 03:35:30.648]  I have Hillary Clinton fatigue!
[03:35:30.888 --> 03:35:33.290]  I have lying, globalist, scum fatigue!
[03:35:33.530 --> 03:35:34.711]  That's the fatigue I have!
[03:35:34.931 --> 03:35:36.272]  I'm sick of being lied to!
[03:35:36.452 --> 03:35:38.173]  I'm sick of my future being stolen!
[03:35:38.353 --> 03:35:39.514]  That's the fatigue I have!
[03:35:39.874 --> 03:35:41.355]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:35:42.496 --> 03:35:43.077]  I'm sick of it!
[03:35:43.657 --> 03:35:44.297]  We have that on it.
[03:35:44.317 --> 03:35:45.198]  Can we get that all in a day?
[03:35:45.238 --> 03:35:45.798]  Gosh!
[03:35:46.059 --> 03:35:52.043]  I don't think you can call Hillary Clinton such lovely names.
[03:35:53.294 --> 03:35:56.536]  Oh, and you get really fired up at 11.42 at night.
[03:35:56.836 --> 03:35:57.597]  We'll see, Leigh-Anne.
[03:35:57.657 --> 03:35:59.398]  What are we in, 12 hours in now?
[03:35:59.859 --> 03:36:00.239]  13 hours?
[03:36:00.739 --> 03:36:01.159]  Oh my.
[03:36:01.500 --> 03:36:03.081]  What else is 13 hours?
[03:36:03.121 --> 03:36:04.041]  It makes me think of someone.
[03:36:04.081 --> 03:36:05.582]  What difference does it make at this point?
[03:36:06.103 --> 03:36:09.565]  Well, you know, we hope we're going to get Elizabeth on here shortly.
[03:36:09.585 --> 03:36:13.068]  And we're going to talk about Hillary Clinton's corruption with her.
[03:36:13.088 --> 03:36:20.613]  And then I have to talk about the connection between Hillary Clinton and possible pedophile rings.
[03:36:21.957 --> 03:36:23.498]  So, but you know what?
[03:36:23.738 --> 03:36:24.539]  Let's vote her in!
[03:36:24.899 --> 03:36:26.581]  Sounds like a real good night here.
[03:36:26.701 --> 03:36:27.401]  You want to sit down?
[03:36:27.421 --> 03:36:28.522]  You want to join us here, Leanne?
[03:36:28.542 --> 03:36:29.323]  We're joined now by...
[03:36:31.283 --> 03:36:38.127]  Elizabeth Imus, Elizabeth, I don't know if you just heard me blow up live here on air, InfoWars.com slash show.
[03:36:38.187 --> 03:36:41.388]  If you want to see me blow up more, go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:36:42.309 --> 03:36:45.430]  Elizabeth, you know, I got in touch with you some years ago.
[03:36:45.510 --> 03:36:47.331]  We were both working on some political projects.
[03:36:47.391 --> 03:36:52.034]  We kind of went our separate ways, but I saw you pop back up on my Twitter feed today.
[03:36:52.094 --> 03:36:53.595]  I saw you were still fighting the good fight.
[03:36:54.295 --> 03:37:01.422]  It's nice to see that you're still fighting the good fight, that you're active on social media, and that you want to see Hillary Clinton put in jail.
[03:37:03.163 --> 03:37:05.906]  Yes, yes, and yes to all of that, actually.
[03:37:05.946 --> 03:37:15.575]  But you know, when I met you several, maybe a couple years ago, you seemed like kind of a normal guy, and I've been watching you tonight, and you're a maniac.
[03:37:15.615 --> 03:37:16.776]  I don't know if you're...
[03:37:17.418 --> 03:37:34.044]  Well no, honestly, here's the thing, I'm a normal guy, like you said, I'm honestly an average guy, I like the same stuff most other guys like.
[03:37:34.064 --> 03:37:40.307]  The problem is, when I have to come on air and I have to talk about Hillary Clinton and how she breaks the law,
[03:37:41.047 --> 03:37:48.970]  Gets away with it, and then gets to run for president, and then I sit back and I think about my past, and when I have little petty crimes, I have to suffer the fullest extent of the law.
[03:37:49.691 --> 03:37:50.671]  I cannot help it.
[03:37:50.811 --> 03:37:51.611]  I lose control.
[03:37:51.671 --> 03:37:52.172]  I really do.
[03:37:52.212 --> 03:37:53.232]  Maybe I have some anger issues.
[03:37:53.652 --> 03:37:54.613]  Well, no, you don't.
[03:37:54.653 --> 03:38:01.315]  But what you're able to do is you're vocalizing your frustration that all of us feel.
[03:38:02.416 --> 03:38:03.396]  The whole country feels it.
[03:38:03.436 --> 03:38:04.657]  That's why this is a movement.
[03:38:04.717 --> 03:38:08.999]  Because we're all so incredibly frustrated at the hypocrisy and
[03:38:10.877 --> 03:38:27.965]  The lack of logic that seems to be like you've been talking about tonight in Hollywood, you know, and a lot, I live in Hollywood and I, I know these people and I've been unfriended by many of them, you know, as soon as they heard how I believe they don't, they became suddenly very intolerant.
[03:38:28.705 --> 03:38:39.550]  But a lot of them, while they might be stupid or idiots or whatever, most of them are really lovely people who have just honestly been lied to.
[03:38:40.134 --> 03:38:45.638]  And that's what's infuriating is that Hillary Clinton is all the things that you were calling all of the celebrities.
[03:38:46.118 --> 03:38:48.700]  I have no doubt that she is all of those things.
[03:38:48.760 --> 03:38:49.521]  She is evil.
[03:38:49.621 --> 03:38:50.582]  She is backwards.
[03:38:50.602 --> 03:39:04.932]  All of the Democratic leadership in the United States are lying specifically with this tribalistic thinking and this tribalistic wording to trick people into this low-level thinking of
[03:39:07.044 --> 03:39:14.948]  What this is really about, when it's not really about racism, it's not really about, you know, oh, somebody is a sexist or says mean things.
[03:39:15.549 --> 03:39:21.332]  It's about a progressive agenda that has to do with globalism and it has to do with taking our freedom away.
[03:39:21.692 --> 03:39:27.074]  And that's what many of these celebrities who are boxed into this group think.
[03:39:27.795 --> 03:39:31.777]  It's almost like electing the high school king or queen from king.
[03:39:33.137 --> 03:39:38.660]  They're boxed into this thinking of, like, I'm just going to kind of go along with the crowd because it sounds nice, you know?
[03:39:38.680 --> 03:39:42.222]  They want to take away our freedom, but it's for the greater good.
[03:39:42.322 --> 03:39:52.527]  So who wants to argue with, well, I want to help people, but they don't really understand that it entails actually enslaving the American people and taking our freedom away.
[03:39:53.982 --> 03:39:54.942]  I hear you.
[03:39:55.383 --> 03:39:59.124]  And it's one thing to be like, oh, okay, you know, there's Hillary Clinton.
[03:39:59.304 --> 03:40:00.404]  Oh, she's a politician.
[03:40:00.444 --> 03:40:01.625]  She's up there lying, whatever.
[03:40:01.645 --> 03:40:06.886]  No, I mean, what type of person lies for an entire speech?
[03:40:07.146 --> 03:40:08.007]  She knows she's lying.
[03:40:08.087 --> 03:40:09.747]  I mean, that's a demon, in my opinion.
[03:40:10.067 --> 03:40:13.349]  This is Elizabeth Imus, at ImusZero on Twitter.
[03:40:13.749 --> 03:40:15.049]  ElizabethImus.com.
[03:40:15.749 --> 03:40:18.950]  Tell me, Elizabeth, what first drew you to Trump?
[03:40:19.110 --> 03:40:20.491]  When did you jump on the Trump train?
[03:40:22.008 --> 03:40:40.377]  You know, it's been a long process and it really started back when that whole thing came out with my father and how the media took him to task and called him a racist for some really stupid and irresponsible, hurtful comments that he said about the Rutgers basketball team.
[03:40:41.477 --> 03:40:50.662]  And what struck me then was that I was so shocked by what they were saying about my father, because even though my father's a millionaire narcissist, and I happen to know a little bit about,
[03:40:51.087 --> 03:40:56.071]  I'm a millionaire narcissist and I can see some of my father in Trump.
[03:40:56.792 --> 03:41:02.457]  And the thing about it is my dad growing up never, ever said anything about black people.
[03:41:02.777 --> 03:41:04.098]  He's not racist at all.
[03:41:04.398 --> 03:41:09.583]  He, if anything, he hates his children more than anything.
[03:41:10.003 --> 03:41:13.826]  But the truth about that was, was so shocking to me.
[03:41:14.126 --> 03:41:18.450]  And then I read Andrew Breitbart's book and I realized what the media is doing.
[03:41:18.490 --> 03:41:19.371]  And I started to kind of,
[03:41:19.955 --> 03:41:29.499]  Peace all of these things together and I really didn't use my voice like I thought I should when Obama was being elected and I regret it.
[03:41:30.079 --> 03:41:41.344]  And so I knew that this this time around and for the past several years I've been involved and interested in politics and I decided that it's going to cost a lot of friendships and quite frankly it has.
[03:41:41.404 --> 03:41:49.507]  It's cost me work opportunities and basically being ostracized by a large majority of people I work with in Hollywood.
[03:41:51.127 --> 03:41:58.990]  But I felt that speaking the truth was more important, and to speak it in love, and to come from a place of understanding.
[03:41:59.050 --> 03:42:08.213]  Because we can sit there and bash Amy Schumer and all of these celebrities, but the truth is, most of them honestly, they really don't know.
[03:42:08.253 --> 03:42:12.594]  They don't understand what it means to be a progressive.
[03:42:12.735 --> 03:42:19.777]  And that, you know, the only thing that any of us ever start out with in this life, and everybody, whether you believe in God or not, can agree,
[03:42:20.319 --> 03:42:23.160]  That the one thing we're all born with is freedom.
[03:42:23.741 --> 03:42:26.162]  We all have the right to be free.
[03:42:26.762 --> 03:42:43.209]  And when people say, oh, you know, I'm a slave or, you know, so they think of the word slavery, they put it into a negative connotation of like, you know, um, a rich man exploiting the work of another poor man and making him a slave for his own enrichment.
[03:42:43.769 --> 03:42:49.672]  But what they don't understand is that taking from one person to give to another,
[03:42:50.683 --> 03:42:51.804]  It's not equal rights.
[03:42:52.004 --> 03:42:53.444]  It can never be equal.
[03:42:53.824 --> 03:42:55.545]  And it's a form of enslavement.
[03:42:56.025 --> 03:43:01.648]  And they don't see that that's actually robbing people of their freedom.
[03:43:01.708 --> 03:43:09.551]  And they don't see that the government is getting not only involved in our healthcare system, our educational system, they're in every facet of our lives.
[03:43:10.172 --> 03:43:17.815]  Because the elite rich believe, they honestly, Hillary Clinton honestly believes she's smarter and better
[03:43:18.345 --> 03:43:23.649]  And she's going to globalize the world, and she wants everyone to have one cookie, not two.
[03:43:24.630 --> 03:43:41.103]  But what they don't realize, or maybe they do realize, and they don't care, they think they can somehow make socialism and fascism and communism all work, is that our founders, our forefathers, came over to this country and founded it because they were fleeing from that kind of dictatorship.
[03:43:41.523 --> 03:43:46.407]  That's what makes America so special, is that there is no other place in the world
[03:43:46.854 --> 03:43:54.297]  Where me, a woman, can speak out without being, you know, told I can't even go to school or I can't drive.
[03:43:54.717 --> 03:43:58.519]  There's no other place in the world where you can actually have the American dream.
[03:43:58.879 --> 03:44:00.720]  This is why they want illegal immigrants.
[03:44:00.740 --> 03:44:08.883]  This is why they want refugees from countries who don't value American freedom because they just want people to depend on the government.
[03:44:08.923 --> 03:44:14.325]  They want to make it all equal and they're doing it in the name of greater good so everybody can thrive and
[03:44:14.858 --> 03:44:16.200]  But it doesn't work.
[03:44:16.441 --> 03:44:17.623]  It ultimately doesn't work.
[03:44:17.763 --> 03:44:19.286]  And we're seeing that in Europe right now.
[03:44:19.346 --> 03:44:20.609]  Nobody wants to go to France.
[03:44:21.250 --> 03:44:26.780]  Nobody wants to go to England or Germany or Sweden is now the number two rape capital in the world.
[03:44:27.873 --> 03:44:30.595]  Sam, sorry I'm going on and on, I'll let you finish.
[03:44:30.675 --> 03:44:31.796]  Well, I completely agree with you.
[03:44:31.816 --> 03:44:36.739]  When you talk about being born free, you know, we have a law of the land.
[03:44:36.900 --> 03:44:38.841]  Now, this country's never been perfect, okay folks?
[03:44:38.861 --> 03:44:56.414]  I'm not claiming America's ever been perfect, but the ideal is, the thought is that you're born free, you're born with the same opportunity as everybody else, the country's never been perfect, but that's the idea, that's what the founders set in the Constitution, that's what you're born with, that's what's so great about America, that's why people rush here, that's why, as you just said,
[03:44:56.914 --> 03:45:01.876]  The founding fathers and the original people came here was because they were sick of being born into the oligarchy.
[03:45:02.096 --> 03:45:08.739]  They were sick of being born into the establishment that forces them into all of these indoctrinating industries like you just talked about.
[03:45:09.060 --> 03:45:12.961]  Healthcare, schools, these are all government-run industries.
[03:45:13.342 --> 03:45:20.705]  Now, it's funny because you talked about how you've had situations in your life where your support for Trump has cost you friends, cost you jobs.
[03:45:21.045 --> 03:45:24.567]  I think it's sad because everything they say that Trump will do
[03:45:25.327 --> 03:45:33.688]  As far as racism or discrimination is concerned, they actually end up doing that to Trump supporters in one of the most unbelievable hypocrisies I've ever seen.
[03:45:33.949 --> 03:45:40.470]  But I'm curious, Elizabeth, what do you say to women when you encounter women that want to vote for Hillary Clinton?
[03:45:40.510 --> 03:45:41.390]  What do you say to them?
[03:45:41.410 --> 03:45:44.170]  I say you're out of your mind!
[03:45:44.790 --> 03:45:48.971]  No, but let me tell you something else, Owen.
[03:45:49.411 --> 03:45:53.752]  There are no Trump or Hillary signs within a 10 mile radius of my home.
[03:45:54.588 --> 03:46:02.031]  And I put up a Trump sign in my front window of my home to, because I thought, well, I don't want it to get stolen.
[03:46:02.791 --> 03:46:06.192]  And somebody shot a gun at my house and broke out the window.
[03:46:06.212 --> 03:46:08.173]  I didn't call the police at one in the morning.
[03:46:08.793 --> 03:46:14.536]  So yeah, it's no, that whole like, uh, that's voter suppression right there.
[03:46:14.856 --> 03:46:17.037]  They say that Trump is doing the voter suppression.
[03:46:17.077 --> 03:46:18.617]  Trump supporters are doing the voter suppression.
[03:46:18.957 --> 03:46:20.798]  You just told a story of real voter suppression.
[03:46:21.601 --> 03:46:22.041]  No, yeah.
[03:46:22.141 --> 03:46:23.502]  I mean, it was really shocking to me.
[03:46:23.542 --> 03:46:34.146]  I couldn't believe that it actually happened, but the window's still broken, and they're finally coming this Friday, because it's an arch, it has a special cut that you had to have made, but I put up more signs.
[03:46:34.186 --> 03:46:36.086]  I said, this is a violation of public speech.
[03:46:36.647 --> 03:46:37.267]  And you know what?
[03:46:37.427 --> 03:46:39.248]  All my neighbors think I'm totally nuts.
[03:46:39.368 --> 03:46:42.289]  One lady was like, this little lady, she says, why don't you take the sign down?
[03:46:42.309 --> 03:46:44.409]  And I'm like, no, I'm not doing it.
[03:46:44.430 --> 03:46:45.810]  I don't care if people think I'm crazy.
[03:46:46.230 --> 03:46:47.471]  I'm not going to be silent.
[03:46:47.871 --> 03:46:49.912]  You know, it sounds like- Yeah!
[03:46:50.872 --> 03:46:50.952]  Ah!
[03:46:53.835 --> 03:46:57.796]  ...silently while they marched their Jewish neighbors off to the death camps.
[03:46:58.296 --> 03:47:07.418]  You know, and I know that's an extreme example, but this is really truly what is happening here is that they are scaring people into being silent.
[03:47:07.618 --> 03:47:11.058]  People, I didn't put a sign on my car because I have a really nice car.
[03:47:11.778 --> 03:47:13.359]  That's a little more expensive to fix.
[03:47:13.819 --> 03:47:18.580]  But, you know, what's happening is truly terrifying.
[03:47:18.820 --> 03:47:20.760]  And what people don't understand is that
[03:47:21.562 --> 03:47:27.907]  Every drop of freedom that you give, they say, Oh, well, so what the NSA can, wherever can look at my emails.
[03:47:27.967 --> 03:47:34.513]  I don't care, you know, but every little drop that you give a freedom away, you can't get that back.
[03:47:34.653 --> 03:47:36.414]  It's very difficult to get it back.
[03:47:36.915 --> 03:47:40.037]  And that's the only way a socialist.
[03:47:40.878 --> 03:47:49.245]  Government can function is if it's under total control and suppression and to intimidate and to hush up.
[03:47:50.077 --> 03:47:52.338]  The citizens, you know, to follow in line.
[03:47:52.398 --> 03:47:55.098]  And that's what people are unfortunately doing.
[03:47:55.278 --> 03:47:56.719]  And I'm not going to be one of them.
[03:47:56.759 --> 03:48:09.282]  If my forefathers risked their lives to come to this great nation, to found it, and died for, you know, so many of our great men, women in service have given their lives for our freedom.
[03:48:10.553 --> 03:48:12.934]  I honestly would be willing to give my life for it.
[03:48:12.994 --> 03:48:14.415]  And I don't care if people don't like me.
[03:48:14.455 --> 03:48:19.958]  If they didn't like me because of that, they weren't my friends to begin with because truth and integrity is everything.
[03:48:19.978 --> 03:48:21.819]  And without it, we have nothing.
[03:48:22.499 --> 03:48:30.663]  And so I want to encourage anyone who's watching this to speak to your, you know, you started with a question about what do I say to other women?
[03:48:30.683 --> 03:48:33.844]  And I tell them, you know, this is a distraction.
[03:48:33.864 --> 03:48:38.046]  These, all these women that came forward with Trump, well, I don't want to discredit them.
[03:48:38.087 --> 03:48:39.007]  I don't know the truth.
[03:48:39.707 --> 03:48:43.970]  You know, if you read, there's a book called Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill.
[03:48:43.990 --> 03:49:01.602]  It was written in the 1932 and I think Chapter 8 or Chapter 11 talks about sexual transmutation and it goes through and it historically documents all of the great leaders in history who were great leaders all had one thing in common and that was a very high sex drive.
[03:49:02.303 --> 03:49:08.287]  And sexual transmutation is the ability to transmutate that energy because sex is a huge
[03:49:09.358 --> 03:49:11.058]  It's something I didn't know.
[03:49:36.969 --> 03:49:38.750]  You know, like I really care about that.
[03:49:38.890 --> 03:49:40.471]  The point is, is we're in deep trouble.
[03:49:40.531 --> 03:49:42.373]  We have people who are out of work.
[03:49:42.753 --> 03:49:48.096]  I'm one of them, but I can't get a job because Hollywood hates me, but I don't need one.
[03:49:48.116 --> 03:49:51.118]  So I can, I have the luxury of being able to speak out.
[03:49:51.919 --> 03:49:54.480]  Um, but there are people who are really suffering.
[03:49:54.541 --> 03:50:00.865]  My health insurance, even though I don't have a job, my health insurance has gone up $200 a month and it's, they're telling me it's going to die.
[03:50:02.056 --> 03:50:03.797]  Yeah, and it's like, what?
[03:50:04.217 --> 03:50:15.943]  I mean, this is, seriously, and I can't imagine people who have children or families, you know, what they're thinking about, what they're doing, and they're so, all these people are caught up on these, like, oh, Trump is a jerk, he's a narcissist.
[03:50:15.963 --> 03:50:16.483]  Well, you know what?
[03:50:16.664 --> 03:50:18.084]  My dad's a narcissist.
[03:50:18.184 --> 03:50:18.705]  Millionaire.
[03:50:18.965 --> 03:50:26.929]  And, well, Trump's probably, I guess, a billionaire, so it's a little bit different, but it's almost like a personality thing, and I get it.
[03:50:26.949 --> 03:50:31.051]  I think he's almost like, if I had to call it, I would say he might be Asperger's, or like,
[03:50:31.499 --> 03:50:39.284]  You know, where they're really super genius, but they say stupid things and they just don't socially connect or get it.
[03:50:40.464 --> 03:50:42.586]  Those things are, you know, so high school.
[03:50:42.626 --> 03:50:48.649]  It's so tribalistic, like people are looking at the little issues and they're not really examining the facts.
[03:50:48.729 --> 03:50:54.693]  Because honestly, we're inundated with media and with everything that's coming in at us in this world.
[03:50:54.733 --> 03:50:56.274]  It's going so fast that people don't
[03:50:56.636 --> 03:51:02.701]  have time or the luxury to, like I do, to read the news all day and to really look at three different newspapers.
[03:51:03.062 --> 03:51:06.805]  You know, now it's like, what do we even look at?
[03:51:06.985 --> 03:51:11.309]  Because as we can see from the WikiLeaks, they're all in bed.
[03:51:11.429 --> 03:51:12.430]  They're all corrupt.
[03:51:12.770 --> 03:51:14.451]  And that's another thing people don't understand.
[03:51:14.471 --> 03:51:16.673]  The media is selling advertising.
[03:51:17.374 --> 03:51:20.196]  They're selling, they're trying to sensationalize the news.
[03:51:20.216 --> 03:51:21.778]  They're not trying to report it accurately.
[03:51:22.098 --> 03:51:23.359]  They're trying to get you to watch them.
[03:51:24.353 --> 03:51:25.814]  And people don't get that either.
[03:51:25.854 --> 03:51:28.276]  So it's really, that's what I tell women.
[03:51:28.316 --> 03:51:34.020]  I try to educate them on just the basic human principles and basic logic, you know.
[03:51:34.040 --> 03:51:35.801]  It's very frustrating.
[03:51:35.881 --> 03:51:37.342]  It's tough.
[03:51:37.362 --> 03:51:40.404]  It's tough to get logic into some of these people's heads.
[03:51:41.065 --> 03:51:44.407]  Final question before we let you go, Elizabeth Imus, ElizabethImus.com.
[03:51:46.420 --> 03:51:49.100]  What do you think the odds are of Trump winning in California?
[03:51:49.241 --> 03:51:50.961]  I think it's probably zero, unfortunately.
[03:51:50.981 --> 03:51:54.141]  And then what do you think the odds are that Trump wins this election?
[03:51:54.161 --> 03:52:00.082]  I am praying to God, literally.
[03:52:00.683 --> 03:52:05.183]  And I've asked people on my Twitter account to join me in prayer because it's in God's hands at this point.
[03:52:05.843 --> 03:52:11.664]  California, I mean, unfortunately we're a blue state, but I've done everything that I possibly can.
[03:52:11.745 --> 03:52:12.545]  And you still voted.
[03:52:12.565 --> 03:52:13.825]  I did, I voted.
[03:52:15.479 --> 03:52:25.186]  Um, you know, there are certain parts of the state that are more red than blue, but unfortunately, you know, it's, I don't know.
[03:52:25.266 --> 03:52:27.107]  I don't know that he's going to win California.
[03:52:27.308 --> 03:52:29.789]  I am praying that he wins.
[03:52:30.009 --> 03:52:36.274]  It's very, um, it's upsetting because you hear the polls and you know that the media is lying to you and you know that they're in bed.
[03:52:36.314 --> 03:52:43.359]  They've been emailing Clinton campaign directly asking for questions and delivering questions to her and
[03:52:44.571 --> 03:52:57.338]  So you know, but it's still frightening because you want to buy into it and you want to think, you know, my feeling is like, well, maybe Trump really will win, but the polls are rigged and maybe somehow, you know, like Julian Assange says.
[03:52:57.759 --> 03:53:01.040]  All right, Elizabeth, I hate to cut you off, but we have to go to break at the top of the hour.
[03:53:01.080 --> 03:53:01.661]  Thank you so much.
[03:53:01.701 --> 03:53:04.122]  Elizabeth Imus dot com at Imus Zero.
[03:53:04.162 --> 03:53:05.303]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:53:21.440 --> 03:53:29.365]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[03:53:29.425 --> 03:53:32.508]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[03:53:33.342 --> 03:53:35.202]  And they're also very affordable.
[03:53:57.327 --> 03:54:04.071]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the InfoWar change the country and the world.
[03:54:04.471 --> 03:54:05.231]  It's a win-win.
[03:54:05.711 --> 03:54:06.472]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:54:24.588 --> 03:54:27.689]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[03:54:28.029 --> 03:54:28.169]  Right?
[03:54:28.189 --> 03:54:30.509]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[03:54:30.889 --> 03:54:34.370]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:54:34.430 --> 03:54:37.571]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:54:38.091 --> 03:54:42.852]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[03:54:43.412 --> 03:54:45.252]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[03:54:45.592 --> 03:54:50.013]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[03:54:50.173 --> 03:54:52.194]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[03:54:52.814 --> 03:54:54.274]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[03:54:54.434 --> 03:54:54.694]  Exactly.
[03:54:54.714 --> 03:54:58.497]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[03:54:58.997 --> 03:55:06.982]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:55:11.724 --> 03:55:20.816]  If you can't see the irony in having a gun ban enforced by men with guns, well then you fail to understand why the Second Amendment was written in the first place.
[03:55:20.856 --> 03:55:23.700]  Throughout history, only slaves are disarmed.
[03:55:23.820 --> 03:55:27.585]  A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[03:55:27.705 --> 03:55:28.806]  The right of the people.
[03:55:28.846 --> 03:55:30.027]  The right of the people.
[03:55:30.107 --> 03:55:33.550]  The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[03:55:33.590 --> 03:55:42.497]  For all of you actors out there who go to your red carpet events, surrounded by full battle rattle SWAT teams, while you accept your award for your latest violent movie.
[03:55:42.817 --> 03:55:54.126]  For all you politicians who spend your 9-5 days scheming up ways to take away my Second Amendment rights, meanwhile you have first responders on site there to protect you, I say this, come and take it.
[03:55:54.306 --> 03:55:56.688]  I have a strict gun control policy.
[03:55:57.248 --> 03:55:59.852]  If there's a gun around, I want to control it.
[03:56:00.493 --> 03:56:01.174]  Clint Eastwood.
[03:56:01.394 --> 03:56:01.935]  Go ahead.
[03:56:02.957 --> 03:56:03.878]  Make my day.
[03:56:04.038 --> 03:56:09.406]  Dads demand guns because it's me that's got to get up and go check out that noise at 2am.
[03:56:09.667 --> 03:56:10.488]  InfoWars.com
[03:56:12.031 --> 03:56:13.912]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[03:56:13.952 --> 03:56:15.853]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[03:56:15.933 --> 03:56:18.654]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[03:56:18.854 --> 03:56:19.674]  Alex Jones.
[03:56:19.754 --> 03:56:22.516]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[03:56:22.576 --> 03:56:25.777]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[03:56:25.797 --> 03:56:27.118]  Deeply I think racist.
[03:56:27.218 --> 03:56:29.059]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[03:56:29.179 --> 03:56:30.979]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[03:56:30.999 --> 03:56:35.081]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[03:56:35.101 --> 03:56:36.262]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:56:36.322 --> 03:56:41.244]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:56:43.337 --> 03:56:46.759]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:56:47.099 --> 03:56:54.242]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:56:54.842 --> 03:57:03.186]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:57:03.206 --> 03:57:07.488]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:57:07.868 --> 03:57:17.314]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:57:17.715 --> 03:57:20.937]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:57:21.117 --> 03:57:32.164]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:57:32.264 --> 03:57:34.910]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[03:57:35.150 --> 03:57:38.097]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[03:57:38.257 --> 03:57:41.123]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[03:57:47.901 --> 03:57:55.329]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[03:57:55.769 --> 03:58:03.437]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[03:58:03.697 --> 03:58:05.799]  As president, I will make it clear.
[03:58:06.647 --> 03:58:11.412]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[03:58:11.972 --> 03:58:17.337]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[03:58:17.397 --> 03:58:20.700]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[03:58:20.780 --> 03:58:23.603]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[03:58:23.803 --> 03:58:26.366]  We came, we saw, he died.
[03:58:28.749 --> 03:58:30.730]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[03:58:31.151 --> 03:58:34.553]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[03:58:34.833 --> 03:58:42.678]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[03:58:50.069 --> 03:58:52.493]  I'm asking you to dream big!
[03:58:52.614 --> 03:58:59.506]  Because with your vote, we are just hours away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life.
[03:59:02.674 --> 03:59:08.976]  How many 70-year-olds do you know that are up after midnight, let alone doing five, six events a day, traveling around the country?
[03:59:08.997 --> 03:59:11.998]  The energy of this man, folks, this guy.
[03:59:20.481 --> 03:59:22.342]  This is, this is, this is unhuman energy.
[03:59:22.382 --> 03:59:23.543]  This guy has the power of God.
[03:59:24.624 --> 03:59:26.325]  I'm not saying he is God.
[03:59:26.765 --> 03:59:32.308]  I'm saying that the American people, their thoughts, their prayers are behind Donald Trump.
[03:59:32.448 --> 03:59:35.350]  This is, this is honestly, this is, this is God's will.
[03:59:35.450 --> 03:59:37.571]  The fact that Donald Trump has this much energy.
[03:59:38.572 --> 03:59:42.915]  The fact that he is still speaking in Michigan after midnight.
[03:59:43.035 --> 03:59:45.696]  Let's take a listen before we get the Pettibone twins on the air.
[03:59:45.716 --> 03:59:48.038]  We will make America safe again.
[03:59:48.839 --> 03:59:53.014]  And we will make America great again!
[03:59:54.147 --> 03:59:55.247]  Thank you, everybody.
[03:59:55.347 --> 03:59:56.708]  Hell yes.
[03:59:57.428 --> 03:59:58.468]  Donald Trump.
[03:59:58.528 --> 03:59:59.628]  God bless you, everybody.
[03:59:59.908 --> 04:00:01.068]  The final night!
[04:00:01.288 --> 04:00:02.889]  It's election eve!
[04:00:03.129 --> 04:00:03.989]  There he is!
[04:00:04.589 --> 04:00:05.529]  Get out and vote Trump!
[04:00:05.549 --> 04:00:06.410]  Thank you, Michigan.
[04:00:06.470 --> 04:00:06.950]  We love you.
[04:00:06.970 --> 04:00:07.530]  We'll be back.
[04:00:07.750 --> 04:00:08.050]  Wow.
[04:00:09.010 --> 04:00:10.550]  What an absolute beast.
[04:00:10.750 --> 04:00:19.772]  Donald Trump has been in beast mode these last couple days, campaigning six events a day, speaking past midnight.
[04:00:19.812 --> 04:00:21.053]  He was on till like 1 a.m.
[04:00:21.113 --> 04:00:21.913]  last night, folks.
[04:00:22.133 --> 04:00:23.033]  Okay, where's Hillary?
[04:00:24.053 --> 04:00:30.700]  You know Hillary, she probably took her knockout from Infowarsstore.com about four hours ago.
[04:00:30.860 --> 04:00:32.202]  She's passed out cold.
[04:00:32.262 --> 04:00:36.566]  They probably injected her with some serum to knock her out so she can be up at 6 a.m.
[04:00:36.586 --> 04:00:38.728]  in the morning to get ready for these results.
[04:00:38.769 --> 04:00:43.093]  Who knows, she was having a bit of a seizure earlier or maybe she was drunk.
[04:00:43.754 --> 04:00:46.136]  Maybe she was having a wine cocktail.
[04:00:46.897 --> 04:00:47.838]  With Wolf Blitzer.
[04:00:48.278 --> 04:00:51.160]  I'm joined by Margaret Howland Studio before we get the Pettibone twins on.
[04:00:51.180 --> 04:00:52.800]  I don't know, Margaret, what do you think?
[04:00:52.820 --> 04:00:55.862]  Hillary Clinton sleeping right now, having a seizure in an iron lung?
[04:00:56.062 --> 04:01:00.245]  Look, we know the woman has a history of liking the drink so and so.
[04:01:00.265 --> 04:01:01.666]  Yeah, I would think so.
[04:01:01.686 --> 04:01:04.687]  You mentioned Trump, that supernatural strength he has.
[04:01:05.168 --> 04:01:12.952]  Clearly, I mean, if you just look at these pictures online, you know, Christians pouring prayer over him, you know, no telling what's holding him up right now.
[04:01:12.992 --> 04:01:14.093]  But that is amazing.
[04:01:14.113 --> 04:01:15.614]  The man's still going.
[04:01:15.634 --> 04:01:16.174]  What a beast.
[04:01:16.314 --> 04:01:17.375]  I know, seriously, right?
[04:01:17.395 --> 04:01:21.616]  I mean, it's such a testament to the character of the person, honestly.
[04:01:21.636 --> 04:01:22.037]  You know what?
[04:01:22.277 --> 04:01:24.498]  In honor of Donald Trump's beast mode.
[04:01:24.838 --> 04:01:25.178]  Yes.
[04:01:27.279 --> 04:01:28.560]  I might stay on until 6 a.m.
[04:01:31.201 --> 04:01:32.481]  I'm speechless, actually.
[04:01:32.821 --> 04:01:33.142]  You know what?
[04:01:33.162 --> 04:01:35.923]  The crew just shot me a look like they're going to come in here and strangle me.
[04:01:37.366 --> 04:01:38.027]  They might kill you.
[04:01:38.267 --> 04:01:38.727]  You know what?
[04:01:38.787 --> 04:01:39.848]  I can feel the energy!
[04:01:39.908 --> 04:01:43.229]  Joe might kill you, nobody else will.
[04:01:43.269 --> 04:01:46.031]  This is what Elizabeth said earlier, folks.
[04:01:46.971 --> 04:01:48.432]  High energy.
[04:01:48.452 --> 04:01:49.232]  Go ahead, Margaret.
[04:01:49.472 --> 04:01:51.774]  Yeah, look, 6am or power cheap.
[04:01:51.874 --> 04:01:53.314]  Oh my gosh.
[04:01:53.334 --> 04:01:54.415]  I'm just gonna pull it out.
[04:01:54.455 --> 04:01:55.776]  Marcos, Marcos Morales.
[04:01:55.796 --> 04:01:56.296]  Who's here?
[04:01:56.316 --> 04:01:58.157]  All night, Owen Troyer.
[04:01:59.037 --> 04:01:59.898]  So here's the deal, folks.
[04:01:59.998 --> 04:02:02.799]  I feel bad because I've got callers that are sitting here waiting.
[04:02:02.819 --> 04:02:04.120]  I'll tell you what, look.
[04:02:04.160 --> 04:02:04.980]  Alright, here's the deal.
[04:02:07.204 --> 04:02:08.227]  Margaret, finish your statement.
[04:02:08.407 --> 04:02:12.477]  Hey guys back there, everybody back there working, thank you so much for making this possible.
[04:02:12.497 --> 04:02:14.121]  Thank you so much for sticking up here with me tonight.
[04:02:14.875 --> 04:02:21.517]  If these callers sitting on the line here for over an hour want me to send them a fan pack, get their names and addresses.
[04:02:21.597 --> 04:02:22.817]  I'll send them my fan pack.
[04:02:22.857 --> 04:02:23.837]  I do this all on my own.
[04:02:24.397 --> 04:02:26.178]  If they're interested, they're waiting for so long.
[04:02:26.198 --> 04:02:27.618]  We still have to get to the Pettibone Twins.
[04:02:27.638 --> 04:02:28.778]  We're going to let Margaret make a statement.
[04:02:29.198 --> 04:02:31.479]  Just get their names and addresses so I can send them something.
[04:02:31.599 --> 04:02:33.339]  I don't want you to think that I don't want to hear from you.
[04:02:33.419 --> 04:02:34.840]  I promise I will take your call.
[04:02:34.920 --> 04:02:37.280]  I will not sign off until I take every call.
[04:02:37.540 --> 04:02:39.481]  Before we go to the Pettibone Twins, Margaret Howell.
[04:02:39.898 --> 04:02:42.762]  Owen, look, we've got to get to these callers, too, and I feel for you.
[04:02:42.782 --> 04:02:51.152]  If you're listening to us, bear with us, because we're in this with you, but going back to Trump, the supernatural strength, you know, we should be covering him, Owen.
[04:02:51.172 --> 04:02:52.895]  You know, we should be lifting him up in prayer.
[04:02:52.915 --> 04:02:53.936]  Honestly, he needs it.
[04:02:53.976 --> 04:02:56.139]  Can you imagine the garbage coming at him?
[04:02:56.279 --> 04:02:57.701]  Like, the crap coming at...
[04:02:57.981 --> 04:02:59.282]  The crap that comes at us.
[04:02:59.382 --> 04:03:00.643]  You're just telling the truth.
[04:03:00.763 --> 04:03:03.005]  I can only imagine what that man's under right now.
[04:03:03.025 --> 04:03:04.286]  It's just amazing that he's still going.
[04:03:04.647 --> 04:03:06.488]  But look, this isn't over yet, folks.
[04:03:06.628 --> 04:03:07.569]  I just want to make that clear.
[04:03:07.609 --> 04:03:09.371]  You know, we've been looking at these numbers, breaking them down.
[04:03:09.391 --> 04:03:10.191]  What if she wins?
[04:03:10.231 --> 04:03:11.032]  What if she takes it?
[04:03:12.854 --> 04:03:13.915]  We're right in the middle of it.
[04:03:13.995 --> 04:03:14.955]  We're in the thick of it.
[04:03:15.015 --> 04:03:15.816]  It's now.
[04:03:15.936 --> 04:03:16.437]  It's now.
[04:03:16.537 --> 04:03:19.820]  You and I have been prepping for this for weeks and weeks and weeks.
[04:03:20.120 --> 04:03:21.541]  Sleeplessly, I might add.
[04:03:21.841 --> 04:03:22.342]  Sleeplessly.
[04:03:22.958 --> 04:03:30.321]  I get a lot of love from people, but I gotta say, if it wasn't for the crew back there, Marcos, Joe, Daria, Ashley, Wes is back there.
[04:03:30.381 --> 04:03:32.302]  Nobody ever gives Wes any shout-outs.
[04:03:32.422 --> 04:03:33.262]  Wes is back there.
[04:03:33.282 --> 04:03:35.083]  How are you doing, Troyer?
[04:03:35.263 --> 04:03:36.003]  What's that, Marcos?
[04:03:36.143 --> 04:03:36.703]  All night.
[04:03:37.124 --> 04:03:37.504]  All night.
[04:03:37.524 --> 04:03:38.524]  We're going until 6am.
[04:03:39.305 --> 04:03:40.865]  Does Rob Dew come in at 6am?
[04:03:41.685 --> 04:03:42.426]  Is that who comes on at 6?
[04:03:43.686 --> 04:03:43.886]  Yep.
[04:03:43.906 --> 04:03:44.986]  6 to 8.
[04:03:45.806 --> 04:03:46.847]  So this is going to be hilarious.
[04:03:46.867 --> 04:03:48.007]  He's actually going to go 6 to 9.
[04:03:48.687 --> 04:03:56.088]  If I'm here at 6am, Rob Dew is going to come in the studio and literally, he'll be like, what are you still doing here?
[04:03:56.148 --> 04:03:58.048]  Are you out of your freaking mind?
[04:03:58.529 --> 04:03:58.929]  Yes!
[04:03:59.489 --> 04:03:59.869]  Yes!
[04:04:00.309 --> 04:04:01.469]  Pace yourself, Owen, please.
[04:04:01.489 --> 04:04:03.669]  You know, we've got a lot more hours.
[04:04:03.949 --> 04:04:05.230]  Just pace yourself.
[04:04:05.290 --> 04:04:07.710]  I know you're a young little whippersnapper, but pace yourself.
[04:04:07.790 --> 04:04:09.510]  High energy.
[04:04:09.971 --> 04:04:12.391]  Alright, do we have the Pettibone twins ready to go?
[04:04:14.929 --> 04:04:15.810]  Let's bring them on.
[04:04:15.990 --> 04:04:16.651]  Here's the deal.
[04:04:16.931 --> 04:04:20.234]  These two have been scathing WikiLeaks.
[04:04:20.334 --> 04:04:22.536]  They have been all over WikiLeaks.
[04:04:22.716 --> 04:04:26.780]  They have literally been doing so much research into what they have found.
[04:04:27.861 --> 04:04:32.345]  And to be honest, folks, it's time to get actually really serious and perhaps even
[04:04:34.326 --> 04:04:43.170]  It's kind of dark here because what we're going to look into here for the next half hour or so is some pretty disturbing stuff.
[04:04:44.231 --> 04:04:56.197]  And, you know, a lot of people have been, I don't know if criticizing is the right word, but responding to the fact that Alex Jones has been very emotional on air, crying at times, almost daily now.
[04:04:56.577 --> 04:05:02.440]  But folks, let me just tell you, I had a moment today, when you start looking into this stuff,
[04:05:03.622 --> 04:05:12.210]  And it starts to become palpable that we really might be dealing with pedophiles running everything.
[04:05:13.111 --> 04:05:17.695]  When you actually start to have stuff that you can sink your teeth into.
[04:05:19.369 --> 04:05:27.413]  It'll really, it humanizes you, it brings you back down to earth, and I bring the Pettibone Twins on, author T.S.
[04:05:27.453 --> 04:05:30.554]  Pettibone, Nicole and Brittany, you guys have been all over this stuff.
[04:05:31.054 --> 04:05:32.815]  Thank you for joining us late here tonight.
[04:05:32.875 --> 04:05:34.876]  Tell me, what have you found?
[04:05:37.037 --> 04:05:39.038]  Regarding the pedophile stuff,
[04:05:39.454 --> 04:05:42.035]  Actually, everything we found, it's been a group effort.
[04:05:42.055 --> 04:05:51.137]  We actually recruited a couple people who, one who goes under the moniker Baldwin, the fourth, and another Zero Hour, and they've been helping us so much.
[04:05:51.177 --> 04:05:54.338]  So we've been gathering, we've all been kind of combing Wikileaks together.
[04:05:54.638 --> 04:06:00.900]  We keep a really close eye on the Donald Reddit because they aggregate all of the really important Wikileaks as they drop.
[04:06:01.380 --> 04:06:06.982]  So just several different places we've been, you know, all of us going out and trying to grab anything we can find, and then we kind of
[04:06:07.472 --> 04:06:20.063]  Yeah, well, we all know about Project Veritas and how they exposed what the DNC was doing.
[04:06:20.864 --> 04:06:24.547]  And so the MSM is trying to discredit Project Veritas.
[04:06:24.567 --> 04:06:29.932]  They're saying that the things that James O'Keefe found were discredited without really any evidence.
[04:06:30.492 --> 04:06:33.315]  So last night in the DNC leaks, what they said was
[04:06:34.230 --> 04:06:41.512]  Um, that Robert Kramer, who is a Democratic operative, we confirmed, we found his name in the DNC leaks last night.
[04:06:42.012 --> 04:06:45.513]  So we, we obviously believed James O'Keefe's video footage.
[04:06:45.533 --> 04:06:46.293]  It was amazing.
[04:06:46.353 --> 04:06:49.394]  And I think he was doing that for like two years undercover.
[04:06:49.874 --> 04:06:53.755]  But like we all know that the thing is there's so much evidence at this point.
[04:06:53.775 --> 04:06:56.196]  Um, you're going to believe what you want to believe.
[04:06:56.516 --> 04:07:01.697]  And, um, I just think right now it's up to just going out there and voting.
[04:07:01.718 --> 04:07:03.418]  I mean, they even have.
[04:07:03.871 --> 04:07:10.075]  Like, last night there was a DDoS attack, so our Twitters went down, and we couldn't access Wikileaks either.
[04:07:10.095 --> 04:07:22.982]  A lot of us, there was a bad gateway, so that happened for, it was about an hour, but the more that we were coming out with, I don't know if, because the DNC, in my opinion, the DNC2 hack was one of the biggest.
[04:07:23.022 --> 04:07:23.302]  Yeah.
[04:07:23.382 --> 04:07:30.267]  Like, this morning there were a couple things, like Hillary Clinton openly, you know, acknowledging that she was
[04:07:31.762 --> 04:07:35.947]  Uh, emailing confidential classified information to John Modesta.
[04:07:36.187 --> 04:07:41.933]  And I mean, he did point, you know, call her out and say, this isn't a, you know, this is the right channel for this, but you know, she should have known better.
[04:07:42.583 --> 04:07:44.864]  So there was that, and I think that was one of the bigger things of the day.
[04:07:44.904 --> 04:07:47.225]  But then like last night, what else was there?
[04:07:47.245 --> 04:07:50.247]  Wolf Blitzer from CNN, including with the DNC.
[04:07:50.307 --> 04:07:50.847]  There was that.
[04:07:51.287 --> 04:07:52.007]  That's pretty big.
[04:07:52.027 --> 04:07:53.928]  There were, yeah, there were several things.
[04:07:53.948 --> 04:07:55.729]  There are quite a few news outlets.
[04:07:56.389 --> 04:07:56.590]  Yeah.
[04:07:56.630 --> 04:07:58.550]  Let's be perfectly honest here, ladies, okay?
[04:07:59.111 --> 04:08:00.091]  This is a joke.
[04:08:00.691 --> 04:08:01.272]  We caught them.
[04:08:02.152 --> 04:08:14.346]  And I think it's amazing that James Comey, the director of the FBI, is going to tell you that he can't find enough evidence or that no logical person would indict them.
[04:08:14.906 --> 04:08:20.152]  Well, James, we've got millions of people around the world who have read these emails.
[04:08:20.512 --> 04:08:22.374]  Bob Kramer, going to the RNC!
[04:08:23.315 --> 04:08:24.476]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[04:08:24.516 --> 04:08:31.321]  They're the ones that are starting these slogans, making up these false narratives about Trump and his bigotry, hating women.
[04:08:31.361 --> 04:08:32.041]  We've caught them.
[04:08:32.061 --> 04:08:35.984]  We've caught them staging this whole plant of Trump being a racist.
[04:08:36.004 --> 04:08:36.705]  What did you find there?
[04:08:37.810 --> 04:08:41.973]  Yeah, that was another thing with the, that he didn't respect women.
[04:08:42.053 --> 04:08:46.616]  We found out that they were planning that since May and collecting all the info and they're like, what should we talk about?
[04:08:46.656 --> 04:08:51.360]  Should we talk about his ex-wife accusing him of rape, which he retracted.
[04:08:51.960 --> 04:08:54.082]  But so yeah, we were reading through those weekly females.
[04:08:54.102 --> 04:08:58.244]  And so they were putting this all together, like a script, which they were editing and they're like, what should we use?
[04:08:58.264 --> 04:08:58.965]  This is too much.
[04:08:59.345 --> 04:09:00.146]  Should we thin it down?
[04:09:00.186 --> 04:09:03.128]  So it was just interesting to see all the attacks that they were planning.
[04:09:03.663 --> 04:09:05.844]  But that was one, and that was really funny to find.
[04:09:05.964 --> 04:09:08.205]  It wasn't that surprising, but yeah, it was interesting.
[04:09:08.625 --> 04:09:08.885]  Right.
[04:09:08.965 --> 04:09:14.007]  It's like, Alex has been saying this for years, you know, InfoWars has been reporting on this for years.
[04:09:14.748 --> 04:09:20.090]  Now we have the actual evidence in congruency with the actual actions on the ground.
[04:09:20.470 --> 04:09:23.211]  They say James O'Keefe is discredited.
[04:09:23.231 --> 04:09:23.551]  I love this.
[04:09:23.571 --> 04:09:24.011]  Discredited!
[04:09:24.051 --> 04:09:24.472]  Discredited!
[04:09:24.492 --> 04:09:24.892]  Discredited!
[04:09:25.672 --> 04:09:27.072]  Bob Kramer, FIRED!
[04:09:27.373 --> 04:09:28.993]  Scott Fogle, FIRED!
[04:09:29.253 --> 04:09:29.533]  Okay?
[04:09:29.713 --> 04:09:31.174]  So who's really discredited here?
[04:09:31.194 --> 04:09:36.936]  Alright, but let's get down to... I mean, this is like... In fact, guys, could you do me a favor?
[04:09:37.956 --> 04:09:39.036]  Pull up the picture.
[04:09:39.736 --> 04:09:40.677]  Here, back in the studio.
[04:09:40.717 --> 04:09:41.497]  Pull up the picture.
[04:09:42.377 --> 04:09:46.038]  Now, a young girl was abducted.
[04:09:48.199 --> 04:09:49.399]  What was her name again?
[04:09:49.659 --> 04:09:50.760]  Madeline McCann.
[04:09:51.912 --> 04:09:53.273]  If you guys could pull up this picture.
[04:09:53.313 --> 04:09:59.798]  Now they have these etches of Megan McCann's alleged kidnappers.
[04:09:59.858 --> 04:10:01.600]  If you guys could please find this image for me.
[04:10:01.640 --> 04:10:06.203]  This is probably the most powerful thing I think we've seen out of the WikiLeaks emails.
[04:10:06.243 --> 04:10:12.068]  This is actually, I mean honestly folks, seeing this is so disheartening.
[04:10:12.689 --> 04:10:15.971]  I can't even find the words and you really need to see the pictures to understand.
[04:10:16.011 --> 04:10:18.874]  But basically, they're going to find these in a second here folks.
[04:10:20.163 --> 04:10:23.246]  All of the, here we go, all of the artist renderings, notice this.
[04:10:23.606 --> 04:10:27.850]  This is, folks, I'm telling you, again, you be the judge, okay?
[04:10:28.431 --> 04:10:30.733]  You be the judge, but look at this.
[04:10:30.933 --> 04:10:32.394]  Look at the artist renderings here.
[04:10:32.995 --> 04:10:33.635]  It gets worse.
[04:10:33.936 --> 04:10:35.577]  I sent you guys actually an updated one.
[04:10:35.617 --> 04:10:44.065]  So here we have John and Tony Podesta looking exactly like the artist renderings of two men who were in the hotel in Portugal
[04:10:45.086 --> 04:10:51.971]  The day that Madeline was abducted, these are the only two men who they have not been able to track down and be able to question.
[04:10:52.251 --> 04:10:53.652]  Now you look at the other people.
[04:10:54.352 --> 04:10:56.994]  Hey guys, there's an updated image, actually, that I sent you.
[04:10:57.334 --> 04:10:58.795]  That's an old one.
[04:10:58.875 --> 04:10:59.916]  There's an updated image.
[04:11:00.556 --> 04:11:02.758]  They found the other people!
[04:11:03.639 --> 04:11:04.679]  Anthony Weiner!
[04:11:05.580 --> 04:11:07.221]  Christine Maxwell!
[04:11:08.182 --> 04:11:08.802]  Go ahead, girls.
[04:11:10.143 --> 04:11:13.105]  Yeah, I mean, if you notice, even in the police sketch,
[04:11:13.558 --> 04:11:24.422]  There's like a little mole above Tony Podesta's eye and it's even in the police sketch, like down to that little detail, which is something that we noticed and we're like, whoa, you know, that's, I mean, couldn't that really be a coincidence?
[04:11:24.562 --> 04:11:24.822]  Yeah.
[04:11:25.042 --> 04:11:36.006]  But there was actually an anonymous Redditor who put together a massive pile of evidence today connecting Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama,
[04:11:36.567 --> 04:11:41.608]  George Soros, Tony and... And then the spirit, the spirit cooking woman.
[04:11:41.968 --> 04:11:43.989]  Marina Abramovitz.
[04:11:45.069 --> 04:11:50.251]  But all of them to the man who owns Comet Ping Pong, that restaurant.
[04:11:50.691 --> 04:11:52.871]  His name is James, do you remember his name?
[04:11:52.891 --> 04:11:53.631]  I can't remember his name.
[04:11:53.672 --> 04:11:54.072]  Alefante?
[04:11:54.112 --> 04:11:55.252]  Friends with David Brock.
[04:11:56.411 --> 04:11:57.812]  Yeah, and David Brock as well.
[04:11:57.872 --> 04:12:00.854]  And so he kind of aggregated all this evidence with all these links.
[04:12:01.014 --> 04:12:01.894]  I tweeted it out.
[04:12:01.914 --> 04:12:03.115]  A lot of people were tweeting this out.
[04:12:03.675 --> 04:12:04.616]  And there's even pictures.
[04:12:04.656 --> 04:12:17.163]  So this man who owns Comic Ping Pong used to just kind of blatantly post really disturbing images on his Instagram and, you know, of children and all these things and, you know, make these really suggestive hashtags.
[04:12:17.203 --> 04:12:17.463]  Yes.
[04:12:18.769 --> 04:12:23.933]  And so what happened was when people started, you know, catching on to him, he deleted everything.
[04:12:24.274 --> 04:12:25.755]  But you know, the internet doesn't forget.
[04:12:25.835 --> 04:12:27.016]  So it was all archived.
[04:12:27.536 --> 04:12:29.798]  And so people were able to put all of this together.
[04:12:29.878 --> 04:12:32.180]  And I mean, when you go through it, it is absolutely mind-blowing.
[04:12:32.360 --> 04:12:35.923]  Hillary Clinton wrote him a personal email, even, which they have a screenshot of.
[04:12:35.943 --> 04:12:37.164]  No, I think it was a card.
[04:12:37.985 --> 04:12:40.207]  It was a card and it was signed by Hillary.
[04:12:40.547 --> 04:12:42.829]  Yeah, so I mean, and he had a...
[04:12:43.346 --> 04:12:47.688]  A picture of even Barack Obama on his Instagram playing ping pong with a younger boy.
[04:12:48.249 --> 04:12:48.889]  Just everything.
[04:12:48.929 --> 04:12:51.190]  It's all there and it's just, it's so disturbing.
[04:12:51.210 --> 04:13:03.736]  A lot of people though have been, like we've been pursuing this and tweeting a lot about this, but today more we did a little less because we're thinking that it's really not going to move the needle at this point in regards to the election, who's going to win.
[04:13:03.776 --> 04:13:08.179]  So we're going to all, you know, come together and really pursue this right after the election.
[04:13:08.239 --> 04:13:12.381]  And right now we're kind of just trying to get pro-Trump hashtags trending like MAGA
[04:13:13.226 --> 04:13:13.566]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:13:30.154 --> 04:13:37.937]  Take what we have access to, do a little research, a little investigating of ourselves on our own, and here's what we found.
[04:13:37.957 --> 04:13:39.578]  Again, you be the judge here, folks.
[04:13:39.698 --> 04:13:43.879]  I'm just going to point out the facts and then you two add whatever I forgot.
[04:13:46.852 --> 04:13:54.380]  Strange emails from the Wikilinks talking about pizza and cheese and hot dogs clearly appears to be some sort of coded word language.
[04:13:54.781 --> 04:13:57.344]  It's alleged that this is the language pedophiles use.
[04:13:58.104 --> 04:14:06.133]  We have renderings of men and a woman who were on the scene when Madeleine McCann was abducted
[04:14:07.034 --> 04:14:13.158]  Every rendering can be matched to someone involved with Hillary Clinton.
[04:14:13.598 --> 04:14:15.119]  This is undeniable stuff, folks.
[04:14:15.139 --> 04:14:16.080]  Again, you be the judge.
[04:14:16.500 --> 04:14:17.460]  I'm pointing out the facts.
[04:14:17.881 --> 04:14:22.644]  We then can trace all of this, all of these people, to CometPizza.
[04:14:23.284 --> 04:14:23.624]  Okay?
[04:14:24.044 --> 04:14:27.567]  Which, the owner of CometPizza is very close to David Brock.
[04:14:28.007 --> 04:14:32.890]  We can also find the owner of CometPizza, as you ladies tweeted out, or talked about just now.
[04:14:33.991 --> 04:14:38.294]  Tweeting weird, sick pictures of young girls making a joke out of it.
[04:14:38.814 --> 04:14:47.921]  We have Tony Podesta, who has weird, artistic, quote-unquote, it's really pedophilia, art in his home.
[04:14:48.481 --> 04:14:53.604]  We have a known Satanist, who invites these people to dinner.
[04:14:54.325 --> 04:14:56.807]  And then, perhaps, the coup de grace.
[04:14:57.547 --> 04:15:02.651]  Joe Biden gives Barack Obama a friendship bracelet
[04:15:03.351 --> 04:15:05.993]  With a slice of pizza charm!
[04:15:07.074 --> 04:15:11.237]  Folks, again, I'm laying out the evidence for you.
[04:15:11.698 --> 04:15:12.659]  You be the judge.
[04:15:13.960 --> 04:15:22.827]  We have a legitimate cause for concern here that these people may be involved in pedophilia, okay?
[04:15:22.967 --> 04:15:24.208]  I'm just gonna throw it out there.
[04:15:24.388 --> 04:15:25.609]  Did I leave anything else out?
[04:15:27.290 --> 04:15:27.571]  No.
[04:15:28.571 --> 04:15:29.092]  Yeah.
[04:15:29.625 --> 04:15:31.767]  I mean, there's so much information here.
[04:15:31.807 --> 04:15:45.216]  Actually some things, I was finding some, I was kind of going around 4chan today and I found a couple threads and one of them had a big stash of all of the photos that were on the Instagram of the man who owns Comic Ping Pong.
[04:15:45.476 --> 04:15:53.922]  And so there was one that I saw of, it was a piece of pizza and on it there was two people in like a sexually explicit, you know, position.
[04:15:55.094 --> 04:15:58.277]  Um, he was like, come join us at, you know, comment ping pong, just like alluding to this.
[04:15:58.337 --> 04:16:00.779]  It's so blatantly obvious at this point.
[04:16:00.799 --> 04:16:03.421]  I mean, when you just look at it, it's highly disturbing.
[04:16:03.781 --> 04:16:09.325]  And I, there was another picture I found about a young girl in a dress and it was like it, there was a, there was a tag line.
[04:16:09.345 --> 04:16:14.870]  He put over a phrase, something like she has a beautiful face, but we only care about the pizza, something like that.
[04:16:14.890 --> 04:16:20.274]  I mean, we're going to start, you know, tweeting all this out and working on this later.
[04:16:20.294 --> 04:16:20.694]  Yeah.
[04:16:22.008 --> 04:16:30.514]  I mean, people on the Donald Reddit, these people are really very determined and which is wonderful because all of this, they're all connected.
[04:16:30.835 --> 04:16:31.715]  They're all in on it.
[04:16:31.795 --> 04:16:40.442]  And it's just, it's really horrific to think that all of this has been going on and now only through WikiLeaks and you know, we're only finding out about it.
[04:16:40.462 --> 04:16:42.283]  It's kind of just horrifying to think that, you know.
[04:16:42.922 --> 04:16:47.365]  You know, if Obama is implicated and stuff, that he's been our president.
[04:16:47.405 --> 04:16:48.606]  Think about this.
[04:16:48.646 --> 04:16:54.109]  Let's say there is no child pedophilia going on, actual sexual actions with these people.
[04:16:54.410 --> 04:16:58.632]  Nonetheless, what we actually have is still disturbing, whatever it is.
[04:16:59.793 --> 04:17:00.093]  Maggie?
[04:17:00.373 --> 04:17:00.874]  Oh my gosh.
[04:17:01.414 --> 04:17:09.058]  First of all, let me just say, you two ladies are at the tip of the spear of this and the citizen journalism going on.
[04:17:09.078 --> 04:17:11.319]  I am so incredibly proud of you both.
[04:17:11.339 --> 04:17:12.499]  Just an honor to talk to you.
[04:17:12.859 --> 04:17:14.540]  My sister is so obsessed with both of you.
[04:17:14.560 --> 04:17:18.102]  She has been sending me your tweets all weekend long, literally
[04:17:18.562 --> 04:17:20.864]  You're breaking this information for people.
[04:17:20.904 --> 04:17:23.205]  People that maybe don't have a chance to look at it.
[04:17:23.505 --> 04:17:28.068]  You're really sending, you know, clear, clear-cut messages, you know, that people can understand.
[04:17:28.509 --> 04:17:32.131]  My question would be, why do you think that mainstream media... They don't give a hoot!
[04:17:32.291 --> 04:17:35.033]  You know, we've got all this amazing information.
[04:17:35.333 --> 04:17:36.374]  Don't you find it frustrating?
[04:17:36.394 --> 04:17:40.737]  You're putting your necks out on the line, putting this online for people in the public.
[04:17:41.057 --> 04:17:41.938]  They're not doing that.
[04:17:41.978 --> 04:17:44.119]  Why do you think they don't give a crap so badly?
[04:17:44.179 --> 04:17:48.362]  I mean, is it really about protecting all of this evil for them, do you think?
[04:17:48.442 --> 04:18:05.725]  I think that once you reach a point that like for many people some of my tweets have been you know getting quite big so I see a lot of the comments you know and a lot of the Hillary supporters will kind of funnel into them and I see them the confirmation bias is just incredible like this evidence like I tweeted you know that
[04:18:06.189 --> 04:18:09.933]  That Donald Reddit whole thing, you know, with the guy who put together the pedophilia thing.
[04:18:09.973 --> 04:18:12.316]  And also a pic, you know, some really disturbing pictures.
[04:18:12.676 --> 04:18:14.318]  And people are like, no, move on.
[04:18:14.358 --> 04:18:15.099]  You know, this is nothing.
[04:18:15.119 --> 04:18:17.601]  You're all just, you know, crazy right wing nut conspiracy theorists.
[04:18:17.962 --> 04:18:19.143]  And I'm like, it's right there.
[04:18:19.463 --> 04:18:24.489]  Like how, how far do you have to go to show people, to make them- It's like they gotta get raped!
[04:18:24.729 --> 04:18:27.132]  These people, these people have to be raped!
[04:18:27.432 --> 04:18:38.681]  Okay, they have to have Hillary Clinton start a war, they have to literally see Hillary Clinton take a child, or John Podesta take a child right in front of them, they have to go to Comet Pizza to actually see this crap to believe it.
[04:18:38.701 --> 04:18:41.844]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, go ahead ladies, I didn't mean to interrupt, but that's what it takes.
[04:18:42.384 --> 04:18:52.212]  No, no, I think it's really interesting, you know, how all this stuff, none of the Hillary supporters believe it, and yet, or no one believes it, you know, except
[04:18:52.682 --> 04:19:02.263]  But when something comes out with Donald Trump, like women coming forward and saying that he, you know, sexually assaulted them or molested them or whatever, everyone just instantly- Automatic.
[04:19:03.112 --> 04:19:03.913]  A bandwagon.
[04:19:04.013 --> 04:19:04.673]  Everyone believes it.
[04:19:04.693 --> 04:19:05.274]  It's everywhere.
[04:19:05.314 --> 04:19:07.876]  And it's just taken as, like, fact immediately.
[04:19:08.497 --> 04:19:09.678]  It's really unusual.
[04:19:10.278 --> 04:19:10.519]  Yeah.
[04:19:10.699 --> 04:19:10.899]  Yeah.
[04:19:10.959 --> 04:19:18.526]  And then on the other hand, Bill Clinton, like, with wanting a broad rank, and, you know, the other, like, poor women who have been, you know, raped or sexually assaulted by him, no one believes them.
[04:19:18.606 --> 04:19:20.848]  And yet they came out so many years ago against him.
[04:19:21.148 --> 04:19:21.308]  Right.
[04:19:21.328 --> 04:19:21.528]  Right.
[04:19:21.608 --> 04:19:22.950]  It's not like he suddenly came out.
[04:19:23.010 --> 04:19:25.292]  It's just like the same thing with Danny Williams.
[04:19:25.492 --> 04:19:29.295]  Here, this guy, for his whole life, has been trying to find out who his father is.
[04:19:29.435 --> 04:19:29.776]  That's it!
[04:19:30.416 --> 04:19:31.956]  This has nothing to do with politics!
[04:19:31.977 --> 04:19:33.197]  This isn't a political move.
[04:19:33.457 --> 04:19:39.419]  He's just trying to get to know his dad, and then he has absolute pieces of crap like Olivia Newsy.
[04:19:40.259 --> 04:19:42.300]  Why are you just starting this movement now?
[04:19:42.560 --> 04:19:43.860]  No, he's been doing this for 10 years.
[04:19:44.060 --> 04:19:48.862]  Hey, Olivia Newsy, why don't you ask the Donald Trump accusers, why are you just accusing Trump now?
[04:19:49.282 --> 04:19:51.242]  Oh, because they haven't been doing it for years.
[04:19:51.442 --> 04:19:56.444]  The double standard on the anti-Trump side of things is so infuriating.
[04:19:57.649 --> 04:19:57.909]  No.
[04:19:58.310 --> 04:20:02.233]  Well, the political correctness is just filled with double standards.
[04:20:04.214 --> 04:20:05.455]  Does it not make you sick?
[04:20:05.475 --> 04:20:06.496]  Can I just interject here?
[04:20:06.516 --> 04:20:12.041]  Does it not make you sick to know that these are the people that are running our country?
[04:20:12.541 --> 04:20:13.402]  This is it.
[04:20:13.522 --> 04:20:16.444]  You know, reading this stuff, you're so disappointed.
[04:20:16.464 --> 04:20:17.385]  You're like, wait a second.
[04:20:17.705 --> 04:20:18.966]  I thought you were intellectual.
[04:20:19.026 --> 04:20:20.307]  I thought you were smarter than I am.
[04:20:20.328 --> 04:20:21.829]  I thought you had more virtue than I did.
[04:20:21.849 --> 04:20:23.330]  I thought you were better than I am.
[04:20:23.390 --> 04:20:24.992]  That's why you're in the position that you're in.
[04:20:25.292 --> 04:20:26.093]  And wait a second.
[04:20:26.253 --> 04:20:29.716]  No, you're just really, really, really evil.
[04:20:30.217 --> 04:20:33.800]  It's just like, it's mind boggling how evil they are.
[04:20:33.820 --> 04:20:35.121]  It's mind boggling.
[04:20:35.141 --> 04:20:36.422]  Exactly.
[04:20:36.682 --> 04:20:42.508]  And I mean, just like to put it into perspective, like the leader of our country is who we elect is a reflection of us.
[04:20:43.191 --> 04:20:48.675]  And so if we elected criminal Hillary Clinton, it's so blatantly obvious how corrupt she is.
[04:20:48.995 --> 04:20:50.016]  What does that say about us?
[04:20:51.038 --> 04:20:52.138]  They were not awake.
[04:20:53.359 --> 04:20:59.821]  I want to believe that it's just that people aren't awake, or they've been so conditioned that they're afraid to question it.
[04:20:59.901 --> 04:21:07.603]  And I empathize with people like that, because you've got to get to a place where you're okay enough to question people in power.
[04:21:07.623 --> 04:21:14.106]  And that takes some guts, and I really commend the two of you, because it's gutsy what you're doing, and you're excavating.
[04:21:14.126 --> 04:21:18.067]  It's wonderful to see it, but a lot of people, they don't have
[04:21:18.707 --> 04:21:30.014]  The guts out there, it just doesn't exist yet, and hopefully this is encouraging to them, but it's just amazing to see you two out front going, you know what, we don't really give a damn, we're doing it anyway, and here's what we found.
[04:21:30.034 --> 04:21:34.257]  Well, at this point, yeah, it's actually, like I said, for a group effort.
[04:21:34.277 --> 04:21:46.284]  Like, for example, my friend Baldwin IV, he actually is the one who found all the info on Jake Tapper yesterday, which was amazing, because a lot of people, like, you know, are like, you know, we know what you are, and so the fact that he found that
[04:21:47.034 --> 04:21:52.275]  You know, everyone was very, you know, happy about that and he was very proud and I was very proud of him.
[04:21:52.355 --> 04:21:55.516]  So yeah, he did a great job at that.
[04:21:55.556 --> 04:22:14.201]  The crazy thing is to me, because as Margaret has pointed out, you and the team that you have assembled have done such a great job going through these WikiLeaks and really, I mean, just the general public, I mean, young high school people who are interested in the future of this country going through the WikiLeaks, looking for all the corruption, finding it.
[04:22:14.741 --> 04:22:25.794]  I mean, actually finding evidence and yet, you know, here we are on the eve of the election and we're still supposed to believe that Hillary Clinton is not a rotted husk of a former human corpse.
[04:22:26.194 --> 04:22:27.235]  But I'm just curious because...
[04:22:28.379 --> 04:22:32.362]  We didn't even have enough time to fully ingest Project Veritas videos.
[04:22:32.682 --> 04:22:38.326]  We don't even have enough time to fully ingest the last round of WikiLeaks, DNC leaks, all this stuff.
[04:22:38.366 --> 04:22:39.767]  We don't have enough time to digest it.
[04:22:40.248 --> 04:22:53.718]  You know, I'm just curious, and I'm wondering what your guys' opinion is on this, because it seems like with each WikiLeaks, it gets more and more intense, more and more extreme, more and more
[04:22:55.014 --> 04:22:55.896]  Demonic!
[04:22:56.277 --> 04:22:57.700]  I mean, literally!
[04:22:58.442 --> 04:22:59.524]  What is next?
[04:22:59.705 --> 04:23:02.611]  Are we even going to have time to digest what we've just discussed?
[04:23:04.670 --> 04:23:07.331]  That's the thing, it's so much information we don't even know where to focus.
[04:23:07.711 --> 04:23:08.991]  That's the thing, there's just so much.
[04:23:09.071 --> 04:23:11.332]  And the thing is, why isn't the MSN covering this?
[04:23:11.592 --> 04:23:13.052]  Like, WikiLeaks is verified.
[04:23:13.552 --> 04:23:17.093]  So these things coming out, why is no one reporting on them?
[04:23:17.253 --> 04:23:20.574]  And, you know, holding Hillary Clinton accountable for these things.
[04:23:20.954 --> 04:23:23.895]  Like, no one's being held accountable unless, you know, it's Donald Trump.
[04:23:24.155 --> 04:23:28.716]  It's just the bias is so obvious that it has to make you question a lot.
[04:23:29.036 --> 04:23:32.297]  I actually tweeted out a WikiLeaks today where it was, um,
[04:23:32.964 --> 04:23:39.346]  They mentioned in it, you know, the Washington elites are almost uniformly believe that Hillary Clinton is going to be elected.
[04:23:39.366 --> 04:23:42.246]  It was just in the basket, basically.
[04:23:42.266 --> 04:23:48.288]  It's what they've all believed, you know, until Donald Trump, you know, he rose up and, you know, shook them up a bit.
[04:23:48.588 --> 04:23:53.369]  Well, on the note of accountability, I think it was General Flynn and Scott Adams of
[04:23:53.905 --> 04:23:56.446]  Who writes the Dilbert comics, they tweet out something similar.
[04:23:56.466 --> 04:23:58.347]  They were saying, we're not just voting this election.
[04:23:58.647 --> 04:24:00.708]  We're acting as the jury, basically.
[04:24:00.748 --> 04:24:00.888]  Yeah.
[04:24:00.908 --> 04:24:02.348]  And I thought that was so awesome.
[04:24:02.688 --> 04:24:17.314]  So when we go into those voting booths tomorrow, you know, whoever hasn't voted yet and vote for Donald Trump, we know that Donald Trump is going to serve justice, you know, because if anything, this election has shown us that our justice system is very broken.
[04:24:17.995 --> 04:24:19.817]  So, but that's really encouraging.
[04:24:19.857 --> 04:24:22.982]  So it is, it is down to the average American citizen now.
[04:24:23.342 --> 04:24:24.023]  It's up to us.
[04:24:24.805 --> 04:24:25.826]  And that's amazing too.
[04:24:25.886 --> 04:24:32.516]  It's almost like somehow in this wicked game that they've been playing to remove
[04:24:33.257 --> 04:24:35.218]  Our power and our say over this country.
[04:24:35.258 --> 04:24:41.840]  We've now reached a point after all of that where we can actually take it back with one vote.
[04:24:42.360 --> 04:24:47.702]  And despite what the brainwashed ninnies want to say, the entire establishment is against Trump.
[04:24:47.922 --> 04:24:52.103]  So even if he gets in, the media is going to be on top of him all day.
[04:24:52.183 --> 04:24:53.684]  He won't be able to get away with anything.
[04:24:53.704 --> 04:24:56.545]  Yeah, that's actually something I was talking about a lot.
[04:24:56.585 --> 04:25:00.466]  We've been talking about because I've been talking to a lot of the bigger accounts on Twitter lately.
[04:25:01.039 --> 04:25:04.741]  And everyone is acknowledging the fact that it's not over if Trump wins.
[04:25:05.122 --> 04:25:17.049]  There's going to be many months where he's going to need this kind of network, this strong social media presence that's, you know, sprung up in defense of him, but is prepared to be objective and will admit when he does something wrong.
[04:25:17.609 --> 04:25:27.716]  But, you know, just trying to be objective and lay out the facts and to help him fight the MSM, who is so clearly now, we know, biased against him, you know, CNN, Clues, the DNC, it's all there.
[04:25:28.669 --> 04:25:29.009]  Yeah.
[04:25:29.349 --> 04:25:34.492]  So a lot of people are agreeing now they're going to stick on for as long as it seems like that they're needed.
[04:25:34.972 --> 04:25:36.573]  Because it's a very powerful movement.
[04:25:36.633 --> 04:25:42.696]  Like, you know, Jared Whine, Mike Cernovich, Paul Just Watson, you know, you guys.
[04:25:42.756 --> 04:25:43.757]  Yeah.
[04:25:44.217 --> 04:25:46.038]  I mean, it's amazing.
[04:25:46.118 --> 04:25:47.378]  It's made such an impact.
[04:25:47.899 --> 04:25:48.379]  Definitely.
[04:25:48.399 --> 04:25:49.319]  Yeah.
[04:25:50.040 --> 04:25:51.901]  I'm so encouraged listening to them, Owen.
[04:25:51.961 --> 04:25:52.461]  I really am.
[04:25:52.701 --> 04:25:54.142]  Well, look, I mean, here's the deal.
[04:25:54.822 --> 04:25:55.903]  I don't even remember
[04:25:57.264 --> 04:26:03.369]  When I first talked to you guys, I don't even remember when it was, but you know, you guys weren't even really involved much in politics at all.
[04:26:04.190 --> 04:26:05.571]  You were writing your book series.
[04:26:05.792 --> 04:26:13.058]  You decided to put that aside for at least this election cycle because you believed that this determined the future of the country.
[04:26:13.078 --> 04:26:17.062]  You didn't think you would have a chance to be an author if Hillary Clinton won down the road.
[04:26:17.762 --> 04:26:19.204]  But I mean, let's just talk about that real quick.
[04:26:19.824 --> 04:26:20.824]  Isn't it empowering?
[04:26:20.844 --> 04:26:21.885]  I mean, isn't it amazing?
[04:26:21.945 --> 04:26:23.566]  Can't you feel the power?
[04:26:23.586 --> 04:26:28.007]  I mean, you are an example right here in a very small amount of time.
[04:26:28.287 --> 04:26:47.555]  For me, it took me, you know, a lot longer to get to this point, but we've entered this point of time where everything is kind of condensed now, where you guys have gone from basically in two months, not even on the map politically, to now actually having something to say, actually having some gravity in this election cycle.
[04:26:49.144 --> 04:26:51.845]  Yeah, well, the thing is we've always really been into this.
[04:26:51.865 --> 04:26:53.625]  We've been following the election so closely.
[04:26:53.645 --> 04:26:55.866]  We would watch you guys like every night.
[04:26:56.346 --> 04:26:59.507]  You know, all that, you know, Breitbart, Zero Hedge, Drudge, every day.
[04:26:59.567 --> 04:27:01.228]  We just never spoke.
[04:27:01.648 --> 04:27:05.869]  So it's basically like when we finally came out, it was like everything came out full force.
[04:27:06.169 --> 04:27:14.132]  But I will mention that we would be nowhere without like, seriously, we've had so much support from wonderful people like Mike Cernovich has been so kind.
[04:27:15.154 --> 04:27:17.416]  Jared Wyand, so many people.
[04:27:17.657 --> 04:27:19.459]  Yeah, you're the first person.
[04:27:19.479 --> 04:27:20.720]  I know, you're the first person.
[04:27:20.780 --> 04:27:23.203]  Yeah, you wrote us and asked to interview us and that was it.
[04:27:23.263 --> 04:27:28.469]  Yeah, so we have to say thank you so much to you and Alex Jones Infowars.
[04:27:28.830 --> 04:27:33.715]  I know, we would love to be Alex one day by the way, just because it would be really amazing.
[04:27:33.735 --> 04:27:34.817]  I don't know.
[04:27:38.290 --> 04:27:38.951]  Well, that's great.
[04:27:39.331 --> 04:27:42.012]  I'm glad that you girls have decided to speak out.
[04:27:42.212 --> 04:27:43.713]  You guys have made a great impact.
[04:27:44.153 --> 04:28:02.821]  And you know, the beauty of it is for me, and I don't know how much you've experienced with this, and maybe you can attest to some of this too, but you know, for me, since I've become outspoken and started getting involved in politics, it's amazing to see the inspirational impact that I have.
[04:28:02.841 --> 04:28:08.704]  If not, okay, I'm not going to be the guy that can take down an entire establishment, right?
[04:28:09.164 --> 04:28:27.012]  But if I can start to inspire people, if I can inspire one person, if I can inspire two people, and then they go inspire two people, and then they go inspire two people, and then they go inspire two people, that's how you start a true revolution of ideas, a true movement of thought.
[04:28:27.472 --> 04:28:31.074]  And this is what we're witnessing now with the Donald Trump movement.
[04:28:31.494 --> 04:28:35.296]  And that's why I don't think it stops after this election, no matter what the result is.
[04:28:35.356 --> 04:28:36.556]  Trump wins, Trump loses.
[04:28:36.836 --> 04:28:38.977]  This movement has way too much momentum.
[04:28:39.017 --> 04:28:42.359]  This is going to have a serious impact on the New World Order.
[04:28:43.359 --> 04:28:57.986]  Well, yeah, because it's been through this election that so many people have been awakened to the fact that there is a New World Order, you know, that there are globalists, you know, like I don't think many, too many people, at least I'm aware, were aware of that before.
[04:28:58.506 --> 04:29:00.907]  So I think people are very aware now that we're in
[04:29:01.570 --> 04:29:02.730]  It's a war of information.
[04:29:02.790 --> 04:29:05.552]  You know how your catchphrase is, like, there's a war on for your mind.
[04:29:05.612 --> 04:29:06.132]  It's true.
[04:29:06.812 --> 04:29:08.072]  That is the battleground right now.
[04:29:08.152 --> 04:29:08.793]  Information.
[04:29:09.293 --> 04:29:19.357]  And so the MSM, we need to combat them because they're the ones shaping the narrative and then they can mold basically how you react because they know what you're thinking.
[04:29:19.457 --> 04:29:22.738]  It's all very scary, but that's why, you know, alt media is so important.
[04:29:23.300 --> 04:29:23.820]  I don't think so.
[04:29:42.574 --> 04:29:49.801]  But yeah, I mean we've met so many amazing people over the past couple weeks, it's just... Well just to echo that, I gotta echo that.
[04:29:49.841 --> 04:29:53.064]  I gotta echo that because I gotta say the same thing.
[04:29:53.264 --> 04:30:01.472]  Just from traveling around, doing exit polls, going to these debates, going to Trump rallies, I mean the people that I've met
[04:30:03.700 --> 04:30:06.862]  It's like we were friends forever, even though we never met.
[04:30:07.822 --> 04:30:11.724]  And it's like we're both on this same thought pattern.
[04:30:11.744 --> 04:30:14.245]  We're both on this same revolutionary thought pattern.
[04:30:14.265 --> 04:30:15.925]  We're both on this same train of thought.
[04:30:16.826 --> 04:30:18.226]  And it's so fast!
[04:30:18.266 --> 04:30:19.007]  It's so fast!
[04:30:19.067 --> 04:30:21.888]  It's so hitting the head of the point.
[04:30:22.668 --> 04:30:28.012]  That, like, once you meet like-minded people, once you get on that same train together, it's just, like, empowering.
[04:30:28.512 --> 04:30:29.853]  And I just have to echo everything you said.
[04:30:29.893 --> 04:30:30.774]  I mean, just like you guys.
[04:30:30.814 --> 04:30:33.556]  I mean, I would have never met you guys if it wasn't for this movement.
[04:30:33.636 --> 04:30:40.561]  I would have never met any of... I mean, there's so many amazing people I've met at these events, so many amazing people I met in Cleveland, at the RNC.
[04:30:41.582 --> 04:30:42.943]  I just want to echo what you just said.
[04:30:42.963 --> 04:30:45.204]  I mean, just the people... It's America!
[04:30:45.224 --> 04:30:46.805]  I mean, America is back!
[04:30:46.865 --> 04:30:48.607]  You sons of bitches, we're back!
[04:30:50.273 --> 04:30:56.797]  Yeah, but I think it really highlighted the fact that there's still a lot of unity in our country, you know, like there's still a lot of patriots.
[04:30:56.897 --> 04:31:10.685]  I think that it was more people, until they realized that their, you know, freedoms were being, you know, you know, incrementally, you know, infringed upon, like certain things just step by step, little by little taken away so you could hardly even notice.
[04:31:10.705 --> 04:31:14.687]  I think when people finally were awoken to that fact, then it kind of
[04:31:15.251 --> 04:31:19.932]  Um, you know, it spurred that urge in them to fight against it because they saw what they were going to lose.
[04:31:19.952 --> 04:31:21.373]  You can't be told you're going to lose something.
[04:31:21.393 --> 04:31:28.414]  You have to actually, you know, some people that's enough for them, but I think the vast majority, it's like, you have to feel yourself losing something to take a stand.
[04:31:28.474 --> 04:31:37.437]  And so many people, and I have to point out that I really do believe a lot, a lot of this movement are younger people, like particularly on like 4chan and Reddit and all these people doing this great work.
[04:31:37.717 --> 04:31:39.237]  A lot of them are anonymous right now, but.
[04:31:39.537 --> 04:31:44.678]  I've actually met a lot of them and I know their real identities and they're all young teenagers, early 20s.
[04:31:44.798 --> 04:31:45.518]  It's amazing.
[04:31:46.378 --> 04:31:54.460]  I think another thing to point out is a lot of, there are quite a few people that she was speaking of that are not even American.
[04:31:54.640 --> 04:31:54.880]  Yeah.
[04:31:55.060 --> 04:31:59.041]  They're from different countries but they see the importance of this election.
[04:31:59.081 --> 04:32:02.022]  They see that it's not just going to impact the U.S.
[04:32:02.422 --> 04:32:04.282]  It's going to have a global impact.
[04:32:04.942 --> 04:32:09.424]  So these people, they're all kind of coming together and they're like, it's not even my election, but I'm going to help.
[04:32:09.464 --> 04:32:12.045]  I'm going to dig through WikiLeaks, you know, when something comes out.
[04:32:12.105 --> 04:32:16.746]  And it's just, yeah, a wonderful person from Serbia who was helping me go through WikiLeaks.
[04:32:16.806 --> 04:32:19.067]  And it was just like, well, I want to see the Clintons go down.
[04:32:19.587 --> 04:32:20.167]  It's awesome.
[04:32:20.587 --> 04:32:21.008]  It's awesome.
[04:32:21.028 --> 04:32:24.149]  The Clintons have committed crimes in tons of other countries.
[04:32:26.583 --> 04:32:27.724]  Yeah.
[04:32:27.764 --> 04:32:33.566]  To the people that are thinking of speaking out, really, the hardest part is just the first step.
[04:32:33.966 --> 04:32:34.806]  It's that first step.
[04:32:35.206 --> 04:32:38.487]  And the thing is, a lot of it is mental fear.
[04:32:38.947 --> 04:32:40.188]  It's in your mind.
[04:32:40.228 --> 04:32:44.689]  It's built up because... I mean, I can't speak for everyone because everyone's in a different situation.
[04:32:44.729 --> 04:32:46.410]  You might risk your finances.
[04:32:46.994 --> 04:32:52.739]  You know, things can depend on your circumstances, but we actually had like the means.
[04:32:52.859 --> 04:32:56.802]  And when you take that first step, the rest, it's just, it's so liberating.
[04:32:57.222 --> 04:32:58.943]  And it's been just so amazing.
[04:32:59.904 --> 04:33:03.127]  We keep saying, oh, we wish we came out way back a year ago.
[04:33:03.207 --> 04:33:04.888]  What were we doing?
[04:33:06.129 --> 04:33:10.973]  Well, the greatest enemy is the enemy that you don't know exists.
[04:33:11.514 --> 04:33:14.136]  And people know the enemy exists now.
[04:33:14.577 --> 04:33:16.338]  And I think Donald Trump has been a major part of that.
[04:33:16.378 --> 04:33:16.779]  Margaret Howe.
[04:33:17.372 --> 04:33:21.015]  Well, let me just say, so you guys, you came out in full force.
[04:33:21.175 --> 04:33:22.195]  We're so glad that you did.
[04:33:22.576 --> 04:33:24.037]  Was there something that sparked it?
[04:33:24.117 --> 04:33:29.281]  Or were you just sick and tired of the bull, like the rest of us, and just wanted to project the truth?
[04:33:29.321 --> 04:33:34.905]  You know, tired of swallowing it and spitting it back out, you just wanted to get on the horn and just talk about the truth.
[04:33:35.285 --> 04:33:35.985]  What was it?
[04:33:36.045 --> 04:33:38.007]  You just finally just decided, okay, enough's enough?
[04:33:40.053 --> 04:33:41.133]  That was basically it.
[04:33:41.474 --> 04:33:53.877]  Because I think the first time we went on InfoWars, we explained that we'd been hoping to get our book published in the industry, the young adult industry, but we gave it so many chances.
[04:33:53.937 --> 04:33:55.398]  We had been doing it for years.
[04:33:55.518 --> 04:33:59.739]  And it just, it just, yeah, it kind of all just built up and it came to that final moment.
[04:33:59.799 --> 04:34:08.282]  And we saw, I think it was just seeing what was happening in the election, seeing how dirty the mainstream media was fighting, you know, all just the devious tactics.
[04:34:08.362 --> 04:34:08.822]  And we just,
[04:34:09.648 --> 04:34:11.829]  We knew Trump was for real.
[04:34:12.410 --> 04:34:15.551]  When he starts calling out the globalists, you know he's for real.
[04:34:15.952 --> 04:34:19.814]  So we were just like, are we going to look back in how many years or whatever?
[04:34:19.954 --> 04:34:21.175]  And we did nothing.
[04:34:21.895 --> 04:34:23.936]  So yeah, that's kind of what it was.
[04:34:24.016 --> 04:34:27.958]  And then it was, we just didn't regret it.
[04:34:28.579 --> 04:34:30.520]  Everyone, even who votes, is contributing.
[04:34:30.540 --> 04:34:33.501]  You're doing your part and no one is asked to do more than voting.
[04:34:33.802 --> 04:34:37.884]  But anyone who even does the smallest thing, you are contributing and I think
[04:34:38.404 --> 04:34:41.450]  You know, it's not about measuring because it's not about individuals.
[04:34:41.470 --> 04:34:42.873]  This is about our country.
[04:34:42.933 --> 04:34:43.755]  It's about freedom.
[04:34:43.775 --> 04:34:45.459]  It's about preserving freedom.
[04:34:47.284 --> 04:34:51.587]  Yeah, it's not about an individual, it's a movement and we're all together and we just have to look at it that way.
[04:34:51.967 --> 04:34:55.530]  And it's, yeah, Trump, what he stands for, it's a symbol of what we want our country to be.
[04:34:55.670 --> 04:34:57.371]  It's not just Trump himself.
[04:34:57.391 --> 04:34:58.812]  Can I ask you, do you believe this?
[04:34:58.872 --> 04:35:08.238]  So we've come down to this one candidate who tells the truth at every turn and then another candidate with a basket full of worms, so disgusting it's difficult to talk about.
[04:35:08.258 --> 04:35:14.422]  You know, we're talking about Podesta, you know, who's been accused of having a torture chamber in his house.
[04:35:14.522 --> 04:35:15.243]  We're talking about...
[04:35:15.643 --> 04:35:24.528]  You know, the slimiest things that people could possibly be accused of, you know, torturing, raping, and murdering children on one end, and then a man that goes around it.
[04:35:24.588 --> 04:35:26.570]  Can you believe that we're in this fight right now?
[04:35:26.630 --> 04:35:28.551]  It's almost amazing that we're right here.
[04:35:28.571 --> 04:35:31.873]  It literally is good versus evil, literally.
[04:35:31.893 --> 04:35:42.019]  Yeah, it definitely is a spiritual war, and I think a lot of people, if they hadn't, you know, thought it before, kind of acknowledged that that
[04:35:44.921 --> 04:35:48.786]  Because it's just, those people all believe in spirits, they're channeling spirits.
[04:35:49.346 --> 04:35:51.209]  And it is, it is a spiritual war.
[04:35:51.229 --> 04:35:54.633]  So I mean, even if some people don't believe in this stuff, they do.
[04:35:54.753 --> 04:35:56.195]  So just be aware of that.
[04:35:56.615 --> 04:36:03.103]  But also, I mean, as the spirit cooking broke, because what happened was I found this video that someone had posted on Reddit, like,
[04:36:03.780 --> 04:36:05.700]  I found it like 30 minutes after it was posted.
[04:36:05.740 --> 04:36:06.901]  This was the spirit cooking thing.
[04:36:06.921 --> 04:36:10.141]  They put it all together with all the links from the WikiLeaks and like the video of Marina.
[04:36:10.161 --> 04:36:10.481]  Yeah.
[04:36:10.721 --> 04:36:16.143]  And so I found it right away just by chance and I put it on Twitter and it just went, it blew up.
[04:36:16.183 --> 04:36:19.963]  And when I woke up, spirit cooking was trending and everyone's like, what is this?
[04:36:20.083 --> 04:36:24.604]  And I legitimately, there were people in my Twitter mentions tweeting me like, I'm atheist.
[04:36:24.644 --> 04:36:28.225]  But last night I read my, I got a Bible and read it for the first time.
[04:36:28.245 --> 04:36:31.366]  Like serious people were really, really scared.
[04:36:31.486 --> 04:36:32.826]  Demons are coming out.
[04:36:33.186 --> 04:36:40.013]  I mean, literally, these people, the demons are coming out and it's almost like at this point they can't even help it.
[04:36:40.073 --> 04:36:43.337]  They have to try to harness even more power from these demons.
[04:36:43.737 --> 04:36:46.701]  I feel bad for, you know, whoever they got locked up.
[04:36:46.761 --> 04:36:47.521]  I'll just leave it there.
[04:36:47.942 --> 04:36:49.764]  But I mean, I really think that the demons are coming out.
[04:36:49.804 --> 04:36:50.485]  But here's the other thing.
[04:36:51.165 --> 04:36:51.765]  Spirit cooking?
[04:36:51.785 --> 04:36:52.226]  Spirit cooking?
[04:36:52.286 --> 04:36:52.866]  Spirit cooking?
[04:36:53.386 --> 04:36:55.347]  What the hell is a spirit cooking?
[04:36:55.367 --> 04:36:57.288]  I've never heard of a spirit cooking.
[04:36:57.528 --> 04:37:06.492]  I've never heard of art where you go up to some bathtub full of blood with like a corpse in it and you like take a spoon and I mean what the hell?
[04:37:06.512 --> 04:37:07.893]  These people are sick freaks.
[04:37:08.173 --> 04:37:09.414]  I didn't even know this existed.
[04:37:09.434 --> 04:37:09.894]  That's another thing.
[04:37:10.114 --> 04:37:13.816]  If it wasn't for these emails I think most people wouldn't even know that this even existed.
[04:37:15.509 --> 04:37:17.110]  There are actually two disturbing things I found.
[04:37:17.130 --> 04:37:18.370]  If you want me to talk about them, I will.
[04:37:19.491 --> 04:37:21.852]  About the Podestas, there were some things I found.
[04:37:22.272 --> 04:37:32.076]  The first one was, you know, we all know he has like a really creepy, you know, art collection that a lot of people, in his home, in his bedroom, that a lot of people are afraid of, you know, even visitors.
[04:37:32.116 --> 04:37:33.236]  They made it in the WikiLeaks.
[04:37:33.616 --> 04:37:39.439]  And there was an article written on him about, or Heather and Tony Podesta about their art collection, which was deleted.
[04:37:39.839 --> 04:37:42.200]  But I think it was Mike Cernovich who had had it archived.
[04:37:42.280 --> 04:37:43.100]  And that's how I found it.
[04:37:43.857 --> 04:37:49.100]  Um, and so basically he has this sculpture in his house, which is bent completely backwards.
[04:37:49.120 --> 04:37:50.060]  The head is cut off.
[04:37:50.100 --> 04:37:51.481]  The Maryland, or the uh, yeah.
[04:37:52.461 --> 04:37:54.562]  Jeffrey Dahmer victim?
[04:37:55.463 --> 04:37:58.064]  Yeah, the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.
[04:37:58.504 --> 04:38:03.667]  It was the same position he would put his victims in, which was highly creepy when that came out.
[04:38:03.707 --> 04:38:06.308]  But I mean, just, why would anyone do that?
[04:38:06.806 --> 04:38:11.431]  You know, I mean, it has to say it has to reflect your mind, I think, you know, having that in your home.
[04:38:11.931 --> 04:38:24.945]  But there was that and there was another which I think this is probably the most disturbing thing I found, but that we found all of us, but it was, we found a photo from the Comet Ping Pong owner's Instagram of
[04:38:25.919 --> 04:38:30.860]  A little of a man, maybe in his thirties, and he was holding a like a child to look.
[04:38:31.180 --> 04:38:31.800]  It was a boy.
[04:38:31.860 --> 04:38:34.321]  I think it was one or two years old, really small.
[04:38:34.681 --> 04:38:36.481]  And he hashtagged it chicken lovers.
[04:38:36.821 --> 04:38:41.122]  So what chicken means it's gay slang for an underage boy.
[04:38:41.142 --> 04:38:43.923]  And so he hashtagged it that.
[04:38:44.303 --> 04:38:49.464]  And then we also found in WikiLeaks, there was an actual quote about, um,
[04:38:50.214 --> 04:38:55.196]  I'm going to go in the backyard and sacrifice a chicken to Moloch, which is some pagan god.
[04:38:55.636 --> 04:38:56.317]  So there was that.
[04:38:56.417 --> 04:38:59.878]  It's just, it's so disturbing and it's there and it's real evidence.
[04:38:59.938 --> 04:39:06.401]  People need to investigate and be aware of what's going on because it's all there and you can look for yourself.
[04:39:06.761 --> 04:39:08.522]  No one's making it up.
[04:39:09.202 --> 04:39:10.262]  It's all available to you.
[04:39:10.302 --> 04:39:11.563]  You just have to make the decision to
[04:39:12.202 --> 04:39:14.964]  To look into it and see what it's about.
[04:39:28.212 --> 04:39:31.494]  Any length for ratings, especially right now when they're dying.
[04:39:31.514 --> 04:39:32.695]  They'll go to any length.
[04:39:33.475 --> 04:39:43.381]  We're talking about, perhaps, busting up an underground pedophile ring that has direct relations to a presidential candidate here, and there's radio silence.
[04:39:43.742 --> 04:39:45.242]  Completely nothing.
[04:39:45.302 --> 04:39:47.384]  And I'll tell you this, we're gonna get you girls off air.
[04:39:47.424 --> 04:39:48.484]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[04:39:48.524 --> 04:39:50.486]  We'll take your final words in a second, but a minute to go.
[04:39:51.345 --> 04:39:56.427]  You were talking about how people from all around the world are hoping Donald Trump gets elected.
[04:39:56.487 --> 04:39:57.828]  Here's what it comes down to, folks.
[04:39:59.108 --> 04:40:17.896]  The reason why people around the world have become so disgusted with America is because we have become fat, stupid, ignorant, lazy, and we've built this amazing wealth, we've built this amazing country, and we've let satanists
[04:40:19.469 --> 04:40:21.710]  Use it to conquer the world, folks.
[04:40:22.350 --> 04:40:22.570]  Okay?
[04:40:22.650 --> 04:40:24.111]  That's why people have been sick of America.
[04:40:24.191 --> 04:40:25.391]  Now America's waking up.
[04:40:25.471 --> 04:40:26.431]  Now America's back.
[04:40:26.491 --> 04:40:32.033]  And people all around the world are hoping that once again America can be a bastion of freedom and justice in the world.
[04:40:32.273 --> 04:40:45.658]  So all it is, is that the whole world is looking at America and they're praying that we're not fat and stupid and ignorant enough to elect a known criminal like Hillary Clinton in.
[04:40:46.078 --> 04:40:48.219]  Final words from Nicole and Brittany Pettibone.
[04:40:49.941 --> 04:40:56.147]  Well, we've been asleep at the wheel for a really long time as a country, letting our government get away with all sorts of things.
[04:40:56.888 --> 04:41:03.654]  But like you were saying on air before we came on, that you're thinking that Donald Trump is like a gift from God.
[04:41:04.315 --> 04:41:05.196]  We have this chance.
[04:41:05.216 --> 04:41:13.524]  When Donald Trump, if he gets in and is elected, like we were saying before, it's not going to be easy, but there's hope to rebuild America.
[04:41:14.790 --> 04:41:16.951]  Yeah, but a lot's gonna have to be torn down first.
[04:41:17.031 --> 04:41:25.372]  And so I think there's a lot of obstacles that our country's gonna have to go through because we've been, like you said, asleep at the wheel so long that you can't reverse that disruption overnight.
[04:41:25.773 --> 04:41:34.995]  So if we all just become aware that we have a lot of work to do, if we all work together and, you know, do our part, I think that, you know, we can reverse it eventually.
[04:41:35.015 --> 04:41:35.075]  And
[04:41:36.383 --> 04:41:36.823]  Yeah.
[04:41:36.883 --> 04:41:37.924]  I mean, we have a shot.
[04:41:38.405 --> 04:41:53.617]  Can you imagine, just really quickly guys, so if for any reason we watch the defeat, Podesta stays in the camp, these sickos stay in power, it's almost unthinkable.
[04:41:53.717 --> 04:41:54.698]  It's unthinkable.
[04:41:54.998 --> 04:41:56.019]  It's upsetting.
[04:41:56.039 --> 04:41:57.160]  My God!
[04:41:57.180 --> 04:41:58.221]  Really?
[04:41:58.241 --> 04:41:59.262]  This is what it's come to.
[04:41:59.302 --> 04:42:00.583]  The sickos stay in power.
[04:42:00.783 --> 04:42:01.203]  That's it.
[04:42:04.628 --> 04:42:08.210]  Yeah, there's many people that just that are aware of that.
[04:42:08.270 --> 04:42:10.151]  And just, I don't know, we'll have to see.
[04:42:10.171 --> 04:42:11.311]  We'll have to see what happens.
[04:42:11.351 --> 04:42:19.795]  But a lot of people, I don't think are very easily going to accept it if she's elected because they just they know it's not about, oh, well, I just don't agree with her.
[04:42:19.815 --> 04:42:23.737]  It's more like she could be, you know, we know she's a criminal.
[04:42:23.857 --> 04:42:29.260]  And, you know, now apparently she's, you know, into the cultist rituals and all these things.
[04:42:29.320 --> 04:42:32.061]  So it's just you can't really let that stand.
[04:42:32.762 --> 04:42:36.445]  You know, let it flourish, you know, where you know that it exists.
[04:42:36.985 --> 04:42:37.386]  Yeah.
[04:42:37.906 --> 04:42:44.331]  She wins, she'll stock the Supreme Court, and then America will never be the same.
[04:42:44.571 --> 04:42:48.995]  Who knows what she'll do if she wins, but it's not going to be in the best interest of we the people.
[04:42:49.375 --> 04:42:50.376]  I know that that's the case.
[04:42:50.916 --> 04:42:52.417]  Thank you girls so much for joining us.
[04:42:52.437 --> 04:42:58.882]  You guys are truly a fine example to young women everywhere that are tuned in tonight and around the world and on Twitter.
[04:42:58.902 --> 04:43:00.604]  So thank you for fighting the good fight.
[04:43:02.759 --> 04:43:06.200]  We'll know in just a couple of days the results of this election.
[04:43:06.220 --> 04:43:09.322]  Thank you so much for having us.
[04:43:09.502 --> 04:43:10.382]  Thank you.
[04:43:11.142 --> 04:43:15.784]  Alright guys, go ahead, follow them on Twitter, Brittany Pettibone, Nicole Pettibone.
[04:43:15.804 --> 04:43:21.086]  You can find all of their great research into WikiLeaks and everything right there.
[04:43:21.146 --> 04:43:26.168]  And you can also find their work at tspettibone.com.
[04:43:26.508 --> 04:43:30.590]  We're going to take a quick break, but on the way out, guys, we had that video
[04:43:33.607 --> 04:43:36.289]  The Pizza and Pedophiles video.
[04:43:37.329 --> 04:43:41.032]  So let's play that on the way out of this segment.
[04:43:41.052 --> 04:43:41.892]  We'll take a quick break.
[04:43:42.492 --> 04:43:46.615]  Let's go ahead and play the Pizza and Pedophiles video.
[04:43:49.897 --> 04:43:53.699]  And we've all come together to celebrate the birth of our Lord.
[04:43:54.680 --> 04:43:56.061]  It wasn't Christmas.
[04:43:57.441 --> 04:44:01.766]  By now you've heard of WikiLeaks and the emails leaked from John Podesta, Hillary's top advisor.
[04:44:02.046 --> 04:44:10.215]  These emails have contained several examples of corruption, law-breaking, collusion within the Clinton campaign and the federal government, and the media.
[04:44:10.676 --> 04:44:18.885]  They also reveal that John Podesta and his brother Tony Podesta participated in an occult black magic ritual called Spirit Cooking with Marina Abramovic.
[04:44:19.622 --> 04:44:20.943]  And then there's the pizza.
[04:44:21.623 --> 04:44:22.324]  Welcome.
[04:44:22.944 --> 04:44:27.706]  Welcome, friendly people, to Comic Pizza and Ping Pong.
[04:44:28.627 --> 04:44:33.129]  Have any of you enjoyed this special pizza here tonight?
[04:44:34.410 --> 04:44:35.291]  But no, she didn't.
[04:44:35.551 --> 04:44:38.912]  She held on to that child all the way to the end.
[04:44:39.153 --> 04:44:43.215]  And the fucked up thing was really, it was after it was born.
[04:44:47.763 --> 04:44:48.790]  Euthanasia!
[04:44:51.858 --> 04:44:54.199]  You're probably wondering what the hell you just watched.
[04:44:54.459 --> 04:44:56.279]  Pizza and ping-pong.
[04:44:57.119 --> 04:45:08.041]  You're probably also wondering why the hell a ping-pong place owned by Friends of the Podestas that Hillary Clinton has even held fundraisers at would also be hosting something as bizarre as this.
[04:45:08.061 --> 04:45:09.781]  It's fucking horrid!
[04:45:09.801 --> 04:45:13.182]  I don't think this is what happens when we're on the strip, babies!
[04:45:13.242 --> 04:45:15.763]  It's, oh, oh, it gets me.
[04:45:15.783 --> 04:45:18.143]  Get in the bag I have!
[04:45:21.704 --> 04:45:32.046]  There's a good chance you've never heard of this because you're probably not a pedophile, but pizza is actually a term used by pedophiles to describe pedophilia or child porn.
[04:45:32.386 --> 04:45:38.128]  Like any other underworld, say like the Mafia for example, the world of pedophilia has its own language.
[04:45:38.708 --> 04:45:41.649]  A language that's often reflected in Podesta's emails.
[04:45:42.589 --> 04:45:43.489]  Here's one example.
[04:45:45.690 --> 04:45:46.390]  A handkerchief
[04:45:46.969 --> 04:45:48.110]  Pizza-related map?
[04:45:49.770 --> 04:45:50.170]  Okay.
[04:45:51.091 --> 04:45:58.774]  But what's really telling is they described this pizza-related handkerchief map as a square cloth handkerchief that's white and black.
[04:45:59.314 --> 04:46:03.436]  This is significant because there actually is something called the handkerchief code.
[04:46:03.756 --> 04:46:08.798]  Black signifies S&M and bondage, and white signifies underage sex.
[04:46:09.844 --> 04:46:26.995]  Which, sure, if you don't know anything about John Podesta and his brother going to occult sex rituals, or Tony Podesta's sculpture in his home that is modeled after the poses that Jeffrey Dahmer put his victims in, or the artwork of Tony Podesta's favorite artist, whose graphic paintings adorn his home.
[04:46:27.632 --> 04:46:31.433]  Or the Clintons and Podesta's close ties to known pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
[04:46:31.633 --> 04:46:34.714]  Or Podesta's close friendship with pedophile Dennis Hastert.
[04:46:35.015 --> 04:46:44.338]  Or the fact that the pizza place right next door has a logo that literally is listed in the FBI database as a symbol for pedophiles.
[04:46:45.418 --> 04:46:46.839]  And then, of course, there's this.
[04:46:52.000 --> 04:46:53.301]  But now you know.
[04:46:55.161 --> 04:46:56.762]  Which makes the Instagram feed of the
[04:46:57.794 --> 04:47:01.176]  Comet Ping Pong's owners seem more than just a little bit creepy.
[04:47:08.719 --> 04:47:13.281]  Well folks, if that doesn't make you sick, I really don't know what does.
[04:47:13.361 --> 04:47:22.485]  And again, this is damning evidence that at the very least should require a statement from these people.
[04:47:23.005 --> 04:47:23.685]  A defense.
[04:47:25.166 --> 04:47:25.286]  And
[04:47:26.633 --> 04:47:31.638]  The lack of a statement, the lack of a defense is very damning against them.
[04:47:32.019 --> 04:47:40.548]  Not just their character that they would ignore this entirely, but I think perhaps even an admission of guilt that they wouldn't address this.
[04:47:41.489 --> 04:47:42.871]  The media won't address this.
[04:47:44.072 --> 04:47:48.397]  And I guess they think because they have the media in their pocket,
[04:47:50.285 --> 04:47:55.933]  They think that this is going to be ignored and that nobody is going to know any of this is going on.
[04:47:55.973 --> 04:48:01.981]  But as you can see in that video, folks, again, you be the judge, that is very damning evidence.
[04:48:02.001 --> 04:48:07.689]  I mean, Maggie... I know, I know.
[04:48:09.205 --> 04:48:10.006]  It makes you sick!
[04:48:10.026 --> 04:48:11.707]  I know.
[04:48:11.767 --> 04:48:12.988]  This is what people don't want to believe.
[04:48:13.028 --> 04:48:28.642]  They don't want to believe that these people in these nice clothes that go to these nice schools that seem to have public service jobs could possibly be raping kids, swapping porno photos, torturing babies.
[04:48:29.182 --> 04:48:30.443]  We're good to go.
[04:48:44.790 --> 04:48:50.075]  He's paying off men that when they were boys he was molesting and raping them.
[04:48:50.375 --> 04:48:57.001]  He was caught because he was doing some weird thing with his bank where he didn't want to tip off anybody so he couldn't take out more than $10,000.
[04:48:57.442 --> 04:48:58.563]  He tipped him off anyway.
[04:48:58.883 --> 04:49:02.286]  Turns out the Speaker of the House of Representatives was a pedophile.
[04:49:02.366 --> 04:49:04.608]  So wrap your brain around this, folks.
[04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:05.849]  It is possible.
[04:49:05.869 --> 04:49:08.932]  These people in these positions, we don't want to believe it, Owen.
[04:49:09.012 --> 04:49:10.033]  We just don't want to believe it.
[04:49:11.435 --> 04:49:12.318]  Classic case of this.
[04:49:12.358 --> 04:49:15.144]  He's one of hundreds of these.
[04:49:15.224 --> 04:49:16.868]  He's not the only one, folks.
[04:49:17.149 --> 04:49:18.753]  Clearly, he's not the only one.
[04:49:21.223 --> 04:49:24.246]  I mean, we've got one of the best justice systems in the world here in America.
[04:49:24.286 --> 04:49:32.595]  The problem is, it allows people with influence to not be held to the same justice that we the people are held to.
[04:49:33.135 --> 04:49:41.804]  And I don't know, in the old days, a guy like Jeffrey Hastert, well let's just say his brain and guts would be splattered all over the concrete and the sidewalk down the street, okay?
[04:49:42.084 --> 04:49:44.186]  And that's what this guy deserves for the stuff he did.
[04:49:44.907 --> 04:49:46.929]  Alright, we're going to go ahead and open up the phone lines.
[04:49:46.949 --> 04:49:49.030]  Thanks to everybody who has been waiting so long.
[04:49:49.070 --> 04:49:51.552]  Seriously, you guys are the best.
[04:49:51.572 --> 04:49:54.975]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[04:49:54.995 --> 04:49:56.956]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[04:49:57.677 --> 04:50:04.502]  Let's start with Robert, who wants to talk about some of the stuff that he's found in the Podesta emails.
[04:50:04.542 --> 04:50:05.202]  Go ahead, Robert.
[04:50:05.222 --> 04:50:07.024]  Alright, how are you guys doing tonight?
[04:50:08.473 --> 04:50:08.953]  We're doing all right.
[04:50:26.935 --> 04:50:27.615]  Yeah, I saw that.
[04:50:27.656 --> 04:50:27.816]  Ugh.
[04:50:53.669 --> 04:50:57.811]  Yeah, the picture, the tag for the picture, and she's not naked, but it's still, you know what I mean, who does that?
[04:50:57.851 --> 04:51:01.492]  There's nobody in the world, unless you're a fucking freak, excuse my language, but nobody does that.
[04:51:01.933 --> 04:51:06.274]  And the tag for the image is, this is the seating arrangement for the youngsters for the next party.
[04:51:06.715 --> 04:51:19.100]  And there's a picture of Obama playing ping pong with a young boy, and the tag is white boys, and you're my next date, this is the Christmas party, like, this is, it's real, as long as this stuff somehow gets beyond
[04:51:20.173 --> 04:51:28.535]  Well, it won't, and that's why we have to absolutely shove it down these people's throats on social media.
[04:51:28.575 --> 04:51:29.896]  We have them in the emails.
[04:51:30.276 --> 04:51:33.497]  They have a 7, a 9-year-old, and an 11-year-old.
[04:51:33.637 --> 04:51:35.517]  Folks, this is in their email, okay?
[04:51:35.597 --> 04:51:37.778]  I'm not making this up!
[04:51:37.798 --> 04:51:41.279]  7, 9, and 11 in the pool for your entertainment.
[04:51:41.599 --> 04:51:43.000]  Lock these creeps up!
[04:51:43.340 --> 04:51:44.802]  Where is the Justice Department?
[04:51:45.042 --> 04:51:46.363]  Where is James Comey?
[04:51:46.743 --> 04:51:48.004]  You are a piece of shit!
[04:51:48.144 --> 04:51:52.948]  I'm sorry, James Comey, you are a piece of crap that you can't investigate this crap.
[04:51:53.188 --> 04:51:55.029]  I had to get callers to call into my show.
[04:51:55.049 --> 04:51:56.651]  I had to get regular citizens.
[04:51:56.951 --> 04:52:01.755]  Everyday citizens do more work to fight for justice in this country than James Comey.
[04:52:02.395 --> 04:52:10.460]  Okay, I've got enough evidence right now that should warrant an investigation into all of these people, and James Comey does nothing!
[04:52:10.820 --> 04:52:12.081]  He does nothing!
[04:52:12.861 --> 04:52:13.481]  Nothing!
[04:52:13.742 --> 04:52:15.262]  What are you doing, James Comey?
[04:52:15.523 --> 04:52:17.384]  You in there with the little pizza party, too?
[04:52:17.724 --> 04:52:18.904]  This is disgusting!
[04:52:19.225 --> 04:52:20.145]  Excuse me, go ahead.
[04:52:20.826 --> 04:52:21.366]  No, it's cool.
[04:52:21.386 --> 04:52:26.429]  What's sad, though, is like, the one you mentioned, that email, that's like the least damaging of anything that's actually out there.
[04:52:27.881 --> 04:52:30.943]  Just these images alone, there's, like I said, there's no way.
[04:52:31.004 --> 04:52:36.627]  There's no way that once this is public, somehow public, I don't know why the mainstream media doesn't want to touch it.
[04:52:36.687 --> 04:52:42.091]  I mean, I can understand trying to protect people, but you can't protect people that are pedophiles.
[04:52:42.391 --> 04:52:43.172]  There's no excuse.
[04:52:43.192 --> 04:52:43.632]  You know what?
[04:52:43.652 --> 04:52:43.952]  You know what?
[04:52:43.972 --> 04:52:45.974]  You're worse than a pedophile, don't you agree?
[04:52:45.994 --> 04:52:50.437]  Those that protect them, that's the only thing worse than the pedophile itself.
[04:52:50.537 --> 04:52:52.338]  I'm going to say something right now.
[04:52:52.358 --> 04:52:54.399]  I'm going to say something right now.
[04:52:55.967 --> 04:53:00.738]  Can we get the, uh, Comet Pizza information up right now on our, uh, on our broadcast?
[04:53:00.758 --> 04:53:02.462]  Can I see the information here of Comet Pizza?
[04:53:03.103 --> 04:53:03.724]  You know what, folks?
[04:53:05.441 --> 04:53:09.322]  We need American citizens to go to Comet Pizza tomorrow and start asking these people some questions.
[04:53:09.722 --> 04:53:10.142]  How about that?
[04:53:10.782 --> 04:53:11.343]  How do you like that?
[04:53:11.743 --> 04:53:12.543]  You know what, media?
[04:53:12.843 --> 04:53:13.643]  You know what, government?
[04:53:13.983 --> 04:53:15.084]  You don't want to do the job?
[04:53:15.284 --> 04:53:17.064]  We'll go ahead and do it for you, okay?
[04:53:17.524 --> 04:53:21.205]  I want to see American citizens in Comet Pizza tomorrow asking questions to these people.
[04:53:21.485 --> 04:53:21.866]  That's all.
[04:53:22.206 --> 04:53:23.326]  Just go ask them some questions.
[04:53:23.626 --> 04:53:24.926]  Show them the emails you found.
[04:53:25.227 --> 04:53:26.487]  Show them the pictures you found.
[04:53:26.687 --> 04:53:27.887]  Show them the evidence you found.
[04:53:28.067 --> 04:53:28.787]  See what happens.
[04:53:29.028 --> 04:53:29.908]  Catch it on camera.
[04:53:30.068 --> 04:53:30.828]  See what happens.
[04:53:31.328 --> 04:53:33.929]  If the FBI, James Come- I'll tell you what, folks, look.
[04:53:36.839 --> 04:53:41.683]  I mean, I pray to God that humans can bring this justice, okay?
[04:53:42.064 --> 04:53:47.608]  I hope that there's enough hope left for this country and humanity that we can bring justice to these people.
[04:53:49.370 --> 04:53:55.735]  And this might be our last chance, but my God, these people are not going to get away with this, folks.
[04:53:56.956 --> 04:54:01.059]  And if humans don't have the drive
[04:54:02.259 --> 04:54:06.101]  And, I mean, we obviously have the ability, we just don't have the drive.
[04:54:06.121 --> 04:54:06.921]  We don't have the interest.
[04:54:06.941 --> 04:54:09.402]  So if we don't have the interest to get this done, good luck.
[04:54:09.422 --> 04:54:11.623]  You're going to have to answer with somebody on the other side.
[04:54:12.124 --> 04:54:12.844]  But I'm going to say this.
[04:54:12.884 --> 04:54:14.065]  Can we get the information?
[04:54:14.265 --> 04:54:15.605]  Let's share this information right now.
[04:54:15.685 --> 04:54:16.886]  Where is Comet Pizza?
[04:54:17.586 --> 04:54:22.188]  What is the name of the pizza joint next to it with the child, little boy rape logo on it?
[04:54:25.110 --> 04:54:25.610]  Let's go.
[04:54:25.730 --> 04:54:26.650]  Go to this place tomorrow.
[04:54:26.770 --> 04:54:27.431]  Ask them questions.
[04:54:27.451 --> 04:54:27.851]  Say, hey, look.
[04:54:29.539 --> 04:54:42.906]  I don't know what's going on here, but I got these WikiLeaks emails, I got these Podestas, I got these videos of stuff going on at your place, I got these images of little boy rape signs across the street.
[04:54:44.427 --> 04:54:45.468]  What the hell's going on?
[04:54:46.088 --> 04:54:47.289]  You're friends with David Brock.
[04:54:48.049 --> 04:54:49.030]  What's going on here?
[04:54:49.070 --> 04:54:50.210]  You guys want to answer any questions?
[04:54:50.570 --> 04:54:51.411]  And I'll tell you what, folks.
[04:54:53.032 --> 04:54:55.873]  If they act like nothing's going on or they freak out, we caught them.
[04:54:56.513 --> 04:54:56.934]  We caught them.
[04:54:57.799 --> 04:55:02.301]  Or if they address this and they say, oh no, then they explain it, well you know what, maybe there's nothing going on.
[04:55:02.341 --> 04:55:03.662]  Maybe there's nothing to see here.
[04:55:03.742 --> 04:55:04.982]  Okay, let's find out.
[04:55:05.362 --> 04:55:05.903]  Let's find out.
[04:55:06.183 --> 04:55:08.284]  Has the New York Police Department raided this place?
[04:55:08.744 --> 04:55:09.344]  Let me ask you that.
[04:55:09.864 --> 04:55:12.185]  Has the FBI raided this place?
[04:55:12.405 --> 04:55:14.786]  Has anyone investigated Comet Pizza?
[04:55:15.087 --> 04:55:18.068]  Is there anybody planning on investigating Comet Pizza?
[04:55:18.328 --> 04:55:20.769]  Does anybody even know what Comet Pizza is?
[04:55:21.009 --> 04:55:22.690]  So I call on the American people.
[04:55:23.090 --> 04:55:24.151]  Don't do anything illegal.
[04:55:24.531 --> 04:55:25.491]  Don't break any laws.
[04:55:25.671 --> 04:55:27.512]  Just go there tomorrow and start asking questions.
[04:55:27.552 --> 04:55:28.593]  Be like, hey, you know what?
[04:55:28.633 --> 04:55:29.833]  This is a place in my neighborhood.
[04:55:29.873 --> 04:55:30.874]  I like getting pizza here.
[04:55:31.274 --> 04:55:33.835]  But all of a sudden I'm seeing this weird stuff going on.
[04:55:33.855 --> 04:55:36.716]  You know, I'm not sure if I want to be buying pizza here anymore.
[04:55:36.756 --> 04:55:38.337]  Can you guys stand up for yourselves?
[04:55:38.377 --> 04:55:39.637]  What's your relation to David Brock?
[04:55:39.657 --> 04:55:40.498]  Do you know the Podestas?
[04:55:40.778 --> 04:55:41.878]  Why do we have these emails?
[04:55:41.918 --> 04:55:43.339]  Why is that logo across the street?
[04:55:43.599 --> 04:55:44.980]  What's going on at Comet Pizza?
[04:55:45.620 --> 04:55:46.462]  There you go, folks.
[04:55:46.502 --> 04:55:47.825]  This is the information war.
[04:55:48.146 --> 04:55:49.428]  This is the human intelligence.
[04:55:49.729 --> 04:55:52.555]  This is how you get involved in this fight.
[04:55:52.755 --> 04:55:53.998]  This is how you change the world.
[04:55:54.018 --> 04:55:54.559]  Think about that.
[04:55:55.452 --> 04:55:56.072]  Think about you!
[04:55:56.672 --> 04:56:14.215]  You're sitting at your couch, it's a Monday night, it's 1 o'clock here, Central Time, you're sitting on your couch, you know, you're watching Info Wars, maybe you're enjoying, you know, some popcorn or something, some chocolate, you're just sitting down, well maybe tomorrow you go to Comet Pizza and you capture video footage that changes the world.
[04:56:14.916 --> 04:56:15.216]  Okay?
[04:56:16.196 --> 04:56:19.296]  That is how you make an impact, folks.
[04:56:19.556 --> 04:56:22.197]  You get off your duff, you go out,
[04:56:23.251 --> 04:56:24.552]  You'd make some action happen.
[04:56:24.913 --> 04:56:26.234]  You'd look for some answers.
[04:56:27.175 --> 04:56:28.276]  What do you think about that, Maggie?
[04:56:29.317 --> 04:56:30.118]  That's what I think about that.
[04:56:30.138 --> 04:56:31.900]  I feel like silk and diamond and silk right now.
[04:56:31.980 --> 04:56:32.841]  I just want to back it up.
[04:56:32.961 --> 04:56:35.844]  Honestly, what more can people do?
[04:56:35.864 --> 04:56:39.167]  It's so freaking frustrating, Owen.
[04:56:39.548 --> 04:56:41.049]  People don't understand.
[04:56:41.069 --> 04:56:43.352]  We look at this stuff day in and day out.
[04:56:43.392 --> 04:56:46.235]  To be able to bring it to you, that is hard enough.
[04:56:46.835 --> 04:56:48.036]  I love your call to action.
[04:56:48.196 --> 04:56:48.657]  Go there!
[04:56:48.797 --> 04:56:50.238]  Go to this place tomorrow!
[04:56:50.759 --> 04:56:56.504]  I want InfoWarriors at Comet Pizza tomorrow questioning what the hell is going on.
[04:56:56.864 --> 04:57:01.508]  Bring the WikiLeaks, bring the pictures, bring the evidence, ask them some questions.
[04:57:01.749 --> 04:57:02.529]  That's that simple!
[04:57:02.710 --> 04:57:04.671]  I'll tell you what, if I was a business owner,
[04:57:05.865 --> 04:57:12.991]  And I had allegations that my business was operating an underground child sex slavery ring.
[04:57:13.571 --> 04:57:16.753]  I think I would be out defending myself immediately.
[04:57:17.214 --> 04:57:17.454]  Right?
[04:57:17.474 --> 04:57:19.696]  With a Megahorn on the frickin' sidewalk.
[04:57:19.956 --> 04:57:20.877]  No question.
[04:57:20.997 --> 04:57:22.438]  So I wonder, will we hear?
[04:57:22.478 --> 04:57:23.519]  There's their address, folks.
[04:57:24.219 --> 04:57:25.960]  Info Warriors in Connecticut.
[04:57:26.101 --> 04:57:27.602]  Again, not asking.
[04:57:27.702 --> 04:57:28.502]  Not asking.
[04:57:28.522 --> 04:57:30.184]  Sorry, in Washington, D.C.
[04:57:30.264 --> 04:57:31.164]  Oh, it's in Washington, D.C.
[04:57:31.224 --> 04:57:31.505]  Oh my.
[04:57:32.385 --> 04:57:36.707]  Hey, Owen, it says it's a kid-friendly neighborhood pizza joint.
[04:57:36.727 --> 04:57:39.769]  You know, Connecticut Avenue Northwest, it's 500.
[04:57:40.069 --> 04:57:40.990]  Okay, let me think.
[04:57:41.810 --> 04:57:44.351]  That is a very nice neighborhood.
[04:57:45.072 --> 04:57:45.812]  You know what, though?
[04:57:45.952 --> 04:57:47.453]  We're in Northwest Washington DC.
[04:57:47.793 --> 04:57:48.594]  Makes sense.
[04:57:49.094 --> 04:57:54.717]  You know, frankly, we need to find the Metro Stop, the closest Metro Stop to this pizza place.
[04:57:54.737 --> 04:57:55.417]  Go there right now.
[04:57:55.457 --> 04:57:56.538]  You know, I'm not even kidding, folks.
[04:57:57.938 --> 04:57:58.779]  You need to go there right now.
[04:58:01.087 --> 04:58:02.327]  You need to go to that place right now.
[04:58:03.227 --> 04:58:04.028]  I'm dead serious.
[04:58:04.088 --> 04:58:07.008]  Go to that place right now and wait for them to open up.
[04:58:08.588 --> 04:58:12.049]  I am dead freaking serious.
[04:58:12.549 --> 04:58:17.590]  We need to have InfoWarriors outside of Comet Pizza until they open their doors tomorrow.
[04:58:22.451 --> 04:58:23.651]  They're kid-friendly, Owen.
[04:58:23.791 --> 04:58:24.211]  Look at that.
[04:58:24.251 --> 04:58:25.172]  They're kid-friendly.
[04:58:25.912 --> 04:58:26.452]  What is that?
[04:58:27.657 --> 04:58:28.477]  Intestines?
[04:58:29.098 --> 04:58:29.658]  Honestly.
[04:58:29.958 --> 04:58:30.758]  Bring your kids!
[04:58:31.078 --> 04:58:31.859]  Free intestines!
[04:58:33.259 --> 04:58:33.919]  Twelve dollars.
[04:58:35.820 --> 04:58:37.000]  I'm gonna tell you something here, folks.
[04:58:42.462 --> 04:58:44.383]  I mean, you... Again, this could be nothing.
[04:58:45.664 --> 04:58:48.105]  We could be blowing this up for nothing, okay?
[04:58:48.325 --> 04:58:48.945]  But I'll tell you what.
[04:58:49.656 --> 04:58:51.857]  We'll never know unless you take action.
[04:58:52.637 --> 04:58:52.918]  Okay?
[04:58:53.378 --> 04:58:54.338]  And I'm dead serious.
[04:58:54.658 --> 04:58:57.980]  In fact, we know that they have us under a magnifying glass, folks.
[04:58:58.400 --> 04:59:04.883]  If they're feeling threatened right now, if they think that their little sex ring, their little child pedophilia ring is under threat... Alleged, alleged.
[04:59:04.903 --> 04:59:05.283]  Alleged.
[04:59:05.884 --> 04:59:12.827]  If they think that they can get away with this and this is actually going on, I guarantee you they're doing everything they can right now to cover this up, folks.
[04:59:13.567 --> 04:59:14.488]  Everything they can.
[04:59:14.828 --> 04:59:19.612]  As soon as these Wikileaks emails came out, they were trying to hide the evidence, if any exists.
[04:59:19.672 --> 04:59:21.974]  Again, this is alleged, but we'll never know.
[04:59:22.335 --> 04:59:23.576]  The FBI is not acting.
[04:59:23.596 --> 04:59:29.060]  No, I'm sorry, is the Washington DC Police Department raiding Comet Pizza right now?
[04:59:29.080 --> 04:59:34.905]  Owen, the death of Seth Rich six weeks later, the DC police chief was promoted.
[04:59:34.925 --> 04:59:37.127]  No, they don't investigate this kind of stuff.
[04:59:37.347 --> 04:59:39.569]  Absolutely not, to answer your question.
[04:59:39.729 --> 04:59:40.190]  Absolutely not.
[04:59:40.390 --> 04:59:44.894]  So I am making a call to action to any info warriors in Washington, D.C.
[04:59:46.488 --> 04:59:51.210]  In fact, look, if you go out there and you capture powerful footage, you'll be on the front page of Drudge.
[04:59:51.510 --> 04:59:52.851]  You'll be on the front page of everything.
[04:59:52.891 --> 04:59:54.872]  You'll be an international hero, okay?
[04:59:55.412 --> 04:59:56.673]  Go out there, do some action.
[04:59:56.953 --> 05:00:04.017]  And I'll tell you what, if anybody goes out there and they send me the footage of them out there staking out Comet Pizza, don't break any laws.
[05:00:04.037 --> 05:00:06.078]  We're gonna buy a beer.
[05:00:06.258 --> 05:00:08.419]  I'll buy you if you're legal to drink around a beer.
[05:00:08.459 --> 05:00:12.781]  If you're not legal to drink around a soda, I'll send you whatever you want, your favorite InfoWars product.
[05:00:12.841 --> 05:00:14.802]  I'll sign a pocket... What?
[05:00:16.906 --> 05:00:18.349]  I'm not slandering anybody here.
[05:00:18.670 --> 05:00:22.599]  I'm saying we have alleged activity going down at Comet Pizza.
[05:00:22.819 --> 05:00:23.461]  We would like...
[05:00:24.474 --> 05:00:25.835]  An answer from the owner.
[05:00:25.855 --> 05:00:26.235]  That's it.
[05:00:26.355 --> 05:00:28.437]  If there's nothing going on, then it shouldn't be a big deal.
[05:00:28.957 --> 05:00:31.138]  Then the owners of Comet Pizza should have no problem.
[05:00:31.319 --> 05:00:32.840]  They're not doing anything wrong.
[05:00:33.100 --> 05:00:34.821]  They should have no problem answering some questions.
[05:00:35.061 --> 05:00:39.644]  In fact, they should be happy to answer questions and defend their company.
[05:00:39.924 --> 05:00:41.065]  Okay, but let's find out!
[05:00:41.525 --> 05:00:42.286]  Let's find out!
[05:00:42.366 --> 05:00:44.027]  I don't see anyone on the streets, folks.
[05:00:44.447 --> 05:00:44.747]  I don't know.
[05:00:44.767 --> 05:00:45.628]  Am I crazy?
[05:00:45.968 --> 05:00:46.589]  Am I crazy?
[05:00:46.609 --> 05:00:47.409]  Is this a bad idea?
[05:00:50.651 --> 05:00:51.352]  Oh, I know.
[05:00:51.392 --> 05:00:52.472]  The deep, dark hole.
[05:00:52.492 --> 05:00:58.456]  You know, this story, the layers of it, it has dragged us all down, honestly, a depression.
[05:00:58.536 --> 05:01:00.718]  A deep, dark, black hole.
[05:01:00.758 --> 05:01:02.459]  We don't want to believe that this is happening.
[05:01:02.499 --> 05:01:03.439]  I love your enthusiasm.
[05:01:04.000 --> 05:01:07.142]  I brought you 44 of the most damning stories in WikiLeaks.
[05:01:07.482 --> 05:01:12.585]  And I don't know if we're going to get to them, honestly, because this is such a bombshell, what we're doing right now.
[05:01:12.705 --> 05:01:14.586]  And we really want people to act.
[05:01:14.666 --> 05:01:18.048]  It's a call to arms, is really what it is, honestly.
[05:01:21.690 --> 05:01:22.831]  I'm getting a buzz in my ear.
[05:01:22.911 --> 05:01:23.331]  What was that?
[05:01:23.351 --> 05:01:23.911]  I couldn't hear you.
[05:01:23.931 --> 05:01:30.374]  Alright, let's go back to Robert before we get into more of these WikiLeaks and the rest of the callers.
[05:01:30.554 --> 05:01:31.935]  Robert, what do you think about that idea?
[05:01:32.816 --> 05:01:33.856]  Well, yeah, absolutely.
[05:01:33.936 --> 05:01:39.119]  I can tell you 100% if anybody else, any authority has these pictures, then they must.
[05:01:39.139 --> 05:01:46.682]  Now, obviously, if WikiLeaks released them, then we know that, you know, that Intel has the same images, and these are 100% incriminating.
[05:01:46.742 --> 05:01:47.903]  Even if they're not naked kids,
[05:01:48.914 --> 05:01:50.395]  Nobody tapes nobody.
[05:01:50.435 --> 05:01:56.142]  There was a woman, like I don't know, last year on Facebook that taped her kid up as punishment and she went to jail.
[05:01:56.442 --> 05:01:58.565]  There is no way whatsoever.
[05:01:58.585 --> 05:02:03.911]  There's a man that sent six photos from a sea vessel and he's spending a year in jail.
[05:02:03.951 --> 05:02:06.494]  The law does not apply to these people, clearly.
[05:02:06.894 --> 05:02:07.834]  Here's the thing.
[05:02:08.175 --> 05:02:09.075]  It has to go public.
[05:02:09.155 --> 05:02:12.397]  The Court of Public Opinion, that's enough.
[05:02:12.517 --> 05:02:16.999]  I mean, I don't know how to express this, but there is no way.
[05:02:17.219 --> 05:02:21.741]  Looking at these pictures, these pictures are 100% guilty of incriminating evidence.
[05:02:21.781 --> 05:02:22.141]  That's it.
[05:02:22.421 --> 05:02:23.762]  You don't need to take more pictures.
[05:02:23.782 --> 05:02:25.002]  These are it.
[05:02:25.243 --> 05:02:28.264]  If the NYPD or anybody else has more than what I have,
[05:02:29.128 --> 05:02:33.652]  If they have what I have, if they have what's been on the internet, what's been released by Wikileaks, they're done.
[05:02:33.712 --> 05:02:34.733]  There's no way to deal with that.
[05:02:34.753 --> 05:02:38.636]  There has to be a legal issue for somebody downloading those photos, just to have them.
[05:02:38.656 --> 05:02:40.037]  I was scared about that.
[05:02:40.157 --> 05:02:47.984]  I was scared, like with the one picture, I was like, you know, am I allowed to pass, I'm trying to pass it on on the internet to get it out, but this is a, I mean, it's, it's, it's a crime just to look at that picture, you know.
[05:02:48.004 --> 05:02:49.745]  But nobody here thinks you didn't have any intent, though.
[05:02:49.785 --> 05:02:54.008]  See, just make the Hillary Clinton argument, you didn't, you didn't have any intent, so I think you can walk away.
[05:02:54.028 --> 05:02:55.750]  But here's the thing, folks, alright, look, alright, here's the deal.
[05:02:56.733 --> 05:03:01.015]  I'm crazy, I'm a lunatic, I'm a raging maniac up here, right?
[05:03:01.055 --> 05:03:02.696]  I sit next to this guy a lot.
[05:03:02.936 --> 05:03:15.921]  You are definitely one of the sanest, most sound-minded people I've ever encountered, who is rather charming, a little sarcastic, a jokester, but nonetheless very, very sane.
[05:03:16.122 --> 05:03:19.343]  And Owen, I appreciate your heart for humanity, I really do.
[05:03:19.383 --> 05:03:20.804]  But here's my point though, here's my point.
[05:03:21.784 --> 05:03:21.984]  Yeah.
[05:03:22.204 --> 05:03:29.927]  Because I'm sitting here, I'm screaming, I'm yelling like a crazed lunatic because I think that we might have evidence here of an underground pedophile ring.
[05:03:29.947 --> 05:03:30.527]  We don't know.
[05:03:30.927 --> 05:03:33.348]  We don't have any investigation ongoing.
[05:03:33.368 --> 05:03:35.049]  We don't have any announcement of an investigation.
[05:03:35.109 --> 05:03:36.930]  So I'm just looking at these pictures, freaking out.
[05:03:36.970 --> 05:03:37.530]  But I'll tell you what.
[05:03:38.274 --> 05:03:40.616]  Because people can't handle that, here's what I'll do.
[05:03:40.676 --> 05:03:41.637]  Here's what I'll do, folks.
[05:03:41.877 --> 05:03:49.144]  Actually, before you go into that, I gotta tell you, we've got a guy on the line who just said he's got a story about a former Comet Pizza employee who was convicted of pedophilia.
[05:03:49.164 --> 05:03:51.045]  Oh, we gotta take... Okay, so we'll take that call, but here's what I'll say.
[05:03:51.265 --> 05:03:55.209]  I'm gonna do this in the brainwashed, proper fashion, okay?
[05:03:57.549 --> 05:04:01.734]  Well folks, we have found some really damning evidence of some pictures.
[05:04:01.975 --> 05:04:02.415]  Alleged.
[05:04:02.676 --> 05:04:05.119]  And we have some alleged pictures.
[05:04:05.159 --> 05:04:08.042]  We have some strange artwork from Tony Podesta.
[05:04:08.082 --> 05:04:13.489]  We have some Satanists who invite the Podestas to a cultic dinner.
[05:04:14.550 --> 05:04:22.458]  It appears though we have some symbolism being used here with pizza and cheese and it may be linked to child pedophilia.
[05:04:23.479 --> 05:04:31.206]  It does look as though David Brock has a connection with this pizza place owner and that the Obamas are well aware of it.
[05:04:31.826 --> 05:04:37.492]  We have footage of Joe Biden touching young girls on camera doing this quite consistently.
[05:04:38.172 --> 05:04:53.104]  Um, and with all of this evidence we have of, you know, some weird activity and satanic occult dinners and weird verbiage in emails and weird symbolism and the way they talk about kids, I think maybe this could warrant a little investigation.
[05:04:53.144 --> 05:04:56.647]  I think that maybe an investigation should be done here, I think.
[05:04:56.687 --> 05:04:57.108]  What do you think?
[05:04:57.148 --> 05:04:58.529]  Do you think we should have an investigation?
[05:04:58.689 --> 05:05:04.534]  An alleged investigation into the alleged WikiLeaks, into the alleged... Yes, I do, actually.
[05:05:04.554 --> 05:05:07.156]  We've got to call her information about one of these.
[05:05:07.316 --> 05:05:07.697]  Thank you.
[05:05:07.777 --> 05:05:08.638]  I can't wait to hear it.
[05:05:08.678 --> 05:05:09.879]  Thank you for the call, Robert.
[05:05:10.019 --> 05:05:14.863]  Let's go to, is that Beardsend, who knows a former employee of Comet Pizza?
[05:05:17.285 --> 05:05:17.985]  Yeah, that's right.
[05:05:18.106 --> 05:05:20.247]  Yeah, so I'm from R the Donald.
[05:05:20.628 --> 05:05:23.910]  We've been digging in on this quite a bit, and we found that a
[05:05:24.795 --> 05:05:28.558]  There's a gentleman by the name of Paul Towne that was actually convicted.
[05:05:28.598 --> 05:05:34.283]  He worked there at Comet Pizza for about a year and a half and he was convicted for pedophilia.
[05:05:34.884 --> 05:05:35.664]  What was his name again?
[05:05:35.684 --> 05:05:38.547]  It was Paul Towne was his name.
[05:05:38.807 --> 05:05:41.609]  Paul Towne?
[05:05:41.890 --> 05:05:45.653]  Let's do a SEO for Paul Towne pedophilia.
[05:05:46.594 --> 05:05:46.914]  Yeah.
[05:05:48.295 --> 05:05:49.596]  How did you come across him?
[05:05:49.636 --> 05:05:51.318]  Like how did you encounter this person?
[05:05:52.381 --> 05:05:59.846]  So we've been just basically going through different employee registrations and things like that that we could find online.
[05:06:00.446 --> 05:06:08.911]  We cross-referenced that information with the police database and we found that this guy, Paul Towne, is actually involved in a pedophilia charge.
[05:06:09.932 --> 05:06:17.917]  Well, I just want to give you a round of applause because this is the type of effort it takes from We The People, folks.
[05:06:18.257 --> 05:06:18.557]  Okay?
[05:06:18.777 --> 05:06:19.018]  Again.
[05:06:19.949 --> 05:06:24.372]  We, I'm sorry, did the FBI call into that show and give us this intel?
[05:06:24.653 --> 05:06:27.214]  Did the Washington Police Department call in and give us this intel?
[05:06:27.355 --> 05:06:29.436]  No, it was a caller, a listener to the show.
[05:06:29.476 --> 05:06:34.380]  So we're going to try to, we're going to figure out if we can actually find any hardcore evidence here.
[05:06:35.000 --> 05:06:37.462]  We've got a great crew here looking into this right now.
[05:06:37.542 --> 05:06:44.267]  So Paul Towne, allegedly a former Comet Pizza employee who has been charged with pedophilia.
[05:06:44.287 --> 05:06:46.128]  We're going to look into that and see if it's true.
[05:06:47.029 --> 05:06:52.830]  If it is true, yet another instance of perhaps evidence that might warrant an investigation here.
[05:06:52.850 --> 05:06:57.012]  Hey Owen, was he charged with pedophilia in the state of Washington, D.C.?
[05:06:57.032 --> 05:07:02.213]  You know what, unfortunately the caller is already gone, so obviously I don't have the answer to that.
[05:07:02.253 --> 05:07:08.834]  But I would think if you just plug his name in, and pedophilia or something like that, you should be able to find a... A mugshot.
[05:07:08.934 --> 05:07:09.415]  A record.
[05:07:09.475 --> 05:07:10.835]  But maybe not, we'll find out.
[05:07:11.320 --> 05:07:13.221]  Well, isn't that just what you want though, Evan?
[05:07:13.542 --> 05:07:18.706]  Oh, and a convicted pedophile working at a family-friendly restaurant.
[05:07:18.726 --> 05:07:19.066]  Oh my god!
[05:07:19.326 --> 05:07:19.906]  Oh my god!
[05:07:20.167 --> 05:07:20.607]  Oh my god!
[05:07:20.627 --> 05:07:21.768]  And I'm sorry to cut you off here.
[05:07:21.788 --> 05:07:26.591]  There was a pedophile in St.
[05:07:26.631 --> 05:07:26.952]  Louis.
[05:07:27.032 --> 05:07:27.712]  There we go.
[05:07:27.752 --> 05:07:29.193]  He worked at an Emo's Pizza.
[05:07:29.213 --> 05:07:29.894]  What was his name?
[05:07:29.914 --> 05:07:30.815]  He abducted a boy!
[05:07:30.835 --> 05:07:31.375]  He ran the pizza joint.
[05:07:31.395 --> 05:07:31.895]  That's right.
[05:07:32.015 --> 05:07:32.556]  Here we go.
[05:07:32.736 --> 05:07:33.677]  He ran the pizza joint.
[05:07:33.697 --> 05:07:34.938]  He was in Kirkwood, Missouri.
[05:07:35.757 --> 05:07:42.158]  Oh, and everybody remembers the famous case, the 15-year-old boy, and it turns out he killed another boy, which is why they ended up catching him.
[05:07:42.178 --> 05:07:42.898]  Oh, my goodness.
[05:07:42.918 --> 05:07:43.078]  Yeah.
[05:07:43.779 --> 05:07:49.500]  Now, I'm not saying... Look, first of all, I know the pizza joint he ran was an Emo's Pizza in St.
[05:07:49.520 --> 05:07:49.760]  Louis.
[05:07:49.820 --> 05:07:53.080]  I know that Emo's Pizza has nothing to do with child pedophilia.
[05:07:53.100 --> 05:07:53.661]  I can tell you that.
[05:07:53.761 --> 05:07:56.461]  It's a local establishment owned and operated by St.
[05:07:56.481 --> 05:07:57.141]  Louis citizens.
[05:07:57.581 --> 05:07:58.802]  They have nothing to do with pedophilia.
[05:07:59.182 --> 05:08:00.062]  I'm just saying that...
[05:08:01.222 --> 05:08:04.466]  You weren't a lot of pedophile working at a child-friendly restaurant.
[05:08:04.486 --> 05:08:12.293]  Maybe it's just a crazy coincidence though that this child kidnapper, I can't think of his name, he lived in Kirkwood, Missouri.
[05:08:12.314 --> 05:08:14.075]  I know the case you're talking about.
[05:08:14.095 --> 05:08:15.337]  He managed Nemo's Pizza.
[05:08:15.857 --> 05:08:17.338]  He was a child abductor.
[05:08:17.359 --> 05:08:20.362]  We love kids, come on!
[05:08:21.215 --> 05:08:23.876]  Again, I don't know if there's any... What was that?
[05:08:23.896 --> 05:08:24.676]  It's just crazy.
[05:08:24.757 --> 05:08:26.617]  It's just ridiculous.
[05:08:27.017 --> 05:08:35.161]  Owen, I've got to take you to some of these WikiLeaks damning stories because the pedophilia... Good Lord, the pedophilia.
[05:08:35.321 --> 05:08:39.523]  All weekend long, it's just... Okay, so Clinton's in private.
[05:08:39.783 --> 05:08:41.804]  44 of the most damning stories from WikiLeaks.
[05:08:41.824 --> 05:08:46.626]  Hillary Clinton tells Goldman Sachs America is arming countries that fund jihadists.
[05:08:47.206 --> 05:08:47.646]  Oh, really?
[05:08:47.666 --> 05:08:49.607]  I wonder who's responsible for that one.
[05:08:49.927 --> 05:09:02.271]  But wait a second, let's not forget that Hillary in her own emails admitted that Saudi Arabia and Qatar were funding ISIS terrorists while she takes money from the Saudi Arabians and the people in Qatar.
[05:09:02.291 --> 05:09:04.211]  You know, it's literally...
[05:09:06.092 --> 05:09:07.673]  Hillary in Goldman Sachs speech.
[05:09:07.793 --> 05:09:09.934]  People who oppose immigration are un-American.
[05:09:09.954 --> 05:09:11.275]  We've covered that here in IMPOWERS.
[05:09:11.595 --> 05:09:14.676]  Bill Clinton mocked working class voters at a private fundraiser.
[05:09:14.736 --> 05:09:15.617]  Leaked transcript.
[05:09:15.677 --> 05:09:23.020]  Bill Clinton says political system is in fact rigged, but don't worry folks, because Hillary Clinton deserves the White House.
[05:09:24.101 --> 05:09:28.823]  You know, we don't really care if it's rigged or not, because we kind of rigged it, but she deserves it, so don't worry.
[05:09:29.123 --> 05:09:34.346]  Bill Clinton tells the donors the border won't be secure for a very long time.
[05:09:35.168 --> 05:09:38.142]  You know, it's almost like Bill Clinton is kind of like...
[05:09:40.152 --> 05:09:45.456]  I mean, I've almost reached a point where I feel like Bill Clinton is actually being held hostage by Hillary.
[05:09:45.696 --> 05:09:46.376]  I think so too.
[05:09:46.396 --> 05:09:55.402]  And he's like, like slowly trying to like... Descending into... Well, like just like leak, like these little things out that it's like, oh my God, like really that's going on?
[05:09:55.422 --> 05:10:00.525]  But he says it kind of like matter-of-factly, like just, oh, like part of the thing and it just goes out there.
[05:10:00.905 --> 05:10:07.890]  And it's like that strange thing where Bill Clinton sent out an email for Hillary Clinton and then there's a cryptic, um,
[05:10:09.159 --> 05:10:09.640]  I don't know.
[05:10:29.275 --> 05:10:30.236]  But not good.
[05:10:30.276 --> 05:10:30.716]  I know that.
[05:10:31.577 --> 05:10:33.879]  You know, the poor man does look like he's on death's door.
[05:10:34.160 --> 05:10:37.463]  And he's not the poor man because, frankly, Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[05:10:37.563 --> 05:10:41.046]  But, you know, he does look like he is knocking on the door of death.
[05:10:41.106 --> 05:10:43.428]  But regardless, he owes her, Owen.
[05:10:43.628 --> 05:10:43.968]  He does.
[05:10:44.009 --> 05:10:44.809]  He owes her.
[05:10:44.889 --> 05:10:47.692]  He owes the witch, apparently, and he's paying up.
[05:10:47.992 --> 05:10:49.073]  Well, yeah, of course he owes her.
[05:10:49.093 --> 05:10:50.995]  If it wasn't for her, he'd probably be in jail for rape.
[05:10:51.215 --> 05:10:58.977]  Seriously, she's the enabler and the protector, and she's done a hell of a job destroying anybody that accuses him of anything!
[05:10:58.997 --> 05:11:02.798]  It's like... Anyway... She's the candidate for women as she takes money from Saudi Arabia.
[05:11:02.818 --> 05:11:03.118]  That's right.
[05:11:03.338 --> 05:11:05.699]  You know, Kathy Shelton, you and I had the honor of meeting her.
[05:11:06.159 --> 05:11:07.019]  I believe her.
[05:11:07.319 --> 05:11:09.580]  What a credible, credible woman.
[05:11:09.620 --> 05:11:13.781]  You know, just hugging that woman, you know the hell she's been through.
[05:11:13.801 --> 05:11:17.262]  And Hillary Clinton has the audacity to traumatize a...
[05:11:18.222 --> 05:11:21.083]  It's no wonder these people are in her campaign.
[05:11:21.123 --> 05:11:23.384]  She has no problem traumatizing 12-year-olds.
[05:11:24.445 --> 05:11:31.208]  But damning information coming out of WikiLeaks, and we know that... How many hours do we have until we have an election count?
[05:11:31.228 --> 05:11:31.608]  Do you know?
[05:11:32.348 --> 05:11:32.788]  We're at 1.18 a.m.
[05:11:32.828 --> 05:11:33.869]  in the morning.
[05:11:33.909 --> 05:11:35.510]  Are you talking about until we get results?
[05:11:35.530 --> 05:11:36.570]  Until we get a result.
[05:11:36.850 --> 05:11:38.151]  I'd imagine like seven hours.
[05:11:39.011 --> 05:11:40.991]  But anyway, this is what it's come down to.
[05:11:41.051 --> 05:11:59.756]  We have a criminal, you know, a career criminal running who is inches away from holding the most powerful office in the world, but apparently we're more concerned with Kim Kardashian's butt and what some, it just, oh my God.
[05:12:01.636 --> 05:12:07.581]  You know, we do this day in and day out, and literally, sometimes... We have a rape whistle!
[05:12:08.021 --> 05:12:09.502]  Bill Clinton rape whistle, folks!
[05:12:09.542 --> 05:12:10.983]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[05:12:11.003 --> 05:12:12.865]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[05:12:13.325 --> 05:12:15.147]  Blow on your whistle, girls!
[05:12:15.207 --> 05:12:16.067]  Blow on your whistle!
[05:12:16.087 --> 05:12:18.009]  That's gonna stop it right there.
[05:12:18.029 --> 05:12:21.272]  Go to warstore.com, go to warstore, Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[05:12:21.512 --> 05:12:23.413]  Ashley Beckford, she's high energy, folks.
[05:12:25.035 --> 05:12:26.597]  1.20 in the morning blowing the rape whistle.
[05:12:27.218 --> 05:12:27.959]  Seriously?
[05:12:28.660 --> 05:12:29.200]  Okay.
[05:12:30.062 --> 05:12:31.363]  We're talking about Bill Clinton.
[05:12:31.383 --> 05:12:32.385]  Get out the rape whistle!
[05:12:33.507 --> 05:12:33.827]  Go ahead.
[05:12:33.947 --> 05:12:35.148]  I'm gonna just keep going.
[05:12:35.629 --> 05:12:39.652]  Alright, so here's how the Clinton's free speech private jet scam works.
[05:12:39.712 --> 05:12:40.973]  We know this from WikiLeaks.
[05:12:41.473 --> 05:12:45.196]  A leaked email show the Clinton campaign coordinating with the Soros organization.
[05:12:45.236 --> 05:12:46.777]  That's no shocker right there, Owen.
[05:12:47.137 --> 05:12:49.459]  I mean, coordinating with Soros, yeah.
[05:12:49.619 --> 05:12:50.500]  There's the rape whistle.
[05:12:50.520 --> 05:12:52.421]  There you go, folks.
[05:12:52.461 --> 05:12:58.466]  Whenever Bill Clinton is near you, in order to avoid unwarranted touching or feeling, blow your Bill Clinton rape whistle.
[05:12:59.571 --> 05:13:04.997]  DOJ official who's friends with John Podesta offers a heads up on Clinton email developments.
[05:13:05.117 --> 05:13:06.218]  It's good they're tipping them off.
[05:13:06.298 --> 05:13:08.880]  Well, they even said in the email, we have to delete these emails.
[05:13:08.900 --> 05:13:10.182]  We have to delete these emails.
[05:13:10.202 --> 05:13:12.124]  You can't say this on the email.
[05:13:12.304 --> 05:13:16.868]  Is there, Sheryl Mills, we might be in a sticky situation here.
[05:13:16.888 --> 05:13:18.530]  We might need to, you know, because the president.
[05:13:18.550 --> 05:13:19.611]  You got to dump those emails.
[05:13:19.771 --> 05:13:20.912]  Dump the emails.
[05:13:20.932 --> 05:13:21.493]  Dump the emails.
[05:13:21.993 --> 05:13:22.494]  Dump the emails.
[05:13:22.794 --> 05:13:23.415]  Right.
[05:13:23.735 --> 05:13:29.320]  Clinton's AIDS-for-profit firm illegally raised $150 million for the Clinton Charity Foundation.
[05:13:29.360 --> 05:13:30.861]  It goes on and on.
[05:13:31.421 --> 05:13:33.903]  I just want to throw it under the desk, frankly.
[05:13:34.364 --> 05:13:35.465]  But here's the thing.
[05:13:35.625 --> 05:13:37.306]  What we're dealing with here, you just illustrated.
[05:13:37.346 --> 05:13:40.649]  We had 44 of the most damning WikiLeaks.
[05:13:40.669 --> 05:13:43.832]  She can't even get through half of them before she has to close the book.
[05:13:45.213 --> 05:13:48.436]  I was going through the WikiLeaks today.
[05:13:50.094 --> 05:14:02.676]  And I wasn't just, you know, because they get these new WikiLeaks, it's like a new book, it's a new chapter in the book every day, a new volume in the WikiLeaks Encyclopedia that gets dropped every day, and I'm sitting here like, okay, you know what?
[05:14:03.598 --> 05:14:04.739]  I'm going to try to make some connections.
[05:14:05.600 --> 05:14:08.022]  Folks, WikiLeaks is so amazing.
[05:14:08.602 --> 05:14:11.064]  You can go on to WikiLeaks and you can search.
[05:14:11.765 --> 05:14:16.228]  They have a search and you can search any word, whatever, and then it searches all of their emails.
[05:14:17.389 --> 05:14:19.351]  It's like, I'm searching Vince Foster.
[05:14:19.551 --> 05:14:20.852]  Clinton's killed Vince Foster!
[05:14:21.052 --> 05:14:22.193]  I'm searching Ron Brown.
[05:14:22.373 --> 05:14:23.614]  Clinton's killed Ron Brown!
[05:14:24.935 --> 05:14:25.195]  What?
[05:14:25.696 --> 05:14:27.096]  It's in their own emails!
[05:14:27.677 --> 05:14:35.361]  Literally, all you have to do is go to WikiLeaks, and if you suspect you can tie something to them via this email, you probably can!
[05:14:35.701 --> 05:14:36.642]  It's that easy!
[05:14:36.662 --> 05:14:42.045]  I just went on there today, I said, you know what, I'm going to look into Vince Foster, I'm going to look into Ron Bowne.
[05:14:42.305 --> 05:14:43.666]  Typed in both their names, boom.
[05:14:43.866 --> 05:14:45.087]  Dozens of times it showed up.
[05:14:45.687 --> 05:14:52.431]  I didn't know the Clintons killed John, I didn't know the Clintons killed, you know, I didn't know that the Clintons killed Vince Foster, I didn't know the Clintons killed all these people.
[05:14:52.471 --> 05:14:53.572]  It's in the freaking emails!
[05:14:54.772 --> 05:14:55.412]  It's fine.
[05:14:55.753 --> 05:14:56.553]  Listen, listen, listen.
[05:14:56.713 --> 05:15:01.115]  The dark corners of the world, they're going to get even darker if this woman gets into office.
[05:15:01.135 --> 05:15:03.936]  You know, those really black holes that we currently have around the globe.
[05:15:04.256 --> 05:15:05.517]  You just wait, folks.
[05:15:05.657 --> 05:15:11.639]  And I brought you this other story, Owen, and I don't know if we're going to even get to it, because it doesn't really fit into our WikiLeaks stuff.
[05:15:11.659 --> 05:15:13.900]  But this one story just got me.
[05:15:13.940 --> 05:15:14.940]  It stuck me in the heart.
[05:15:15.401 --> 05:15:16.801]  I hate hearing stories like this.
[05:15:16.841 --> 05:15:17.742]  It was up on Drudge.
[05:15:18.162 --> 05:15:18.702]  The U.S.
[05:15:18.822 --> 05:15:21.483]  lost six elite Green Berets in a 72-hour span last week.
[05:15:23.891 --> 05:15:24.611]  No coverage.
[05:15:25.092 --> 05:15:25.332]  None.
[05:15:26.012 --> 05:15:32.595]  Six elite forces, they're dying on the ground, you know, they're shedding their blood for us, and yet we're gonna prop up a criminal!
[05:15:32.955 --> 05:15:33.576]  Maybe!
[05:15:34.196 --> 05:15:42.160]  Because we don't have enough either tenacity or gall to say no, or maybe we won't today because, you know, it's bad.
[05:15:43.480 --> 05:15:50.183]  And how many times has Barack Obama gone up here and campaigned for Hillary and talked about how great Hillary Clinton is?
[05:15:50.363 --> 05:15:51.124]  She's so great!
[05:15:51.164 --> 05:15:51.684]  She's the best!
[05:15:51.704 --> 05:15:52.184]  She's the best!
[05:15:52.224 --> 05:15:53.045]  She's the best!
[05:15:53.065 --> 05:15:53.925]  She's the best!
[05:15:54.065 --> 05:15:55.446]  Hello Benghazi!
[05:15:55.526 --> 05:15:56.466]  You know what?
[05:15:56.526 --> 05:15:58.327]  Nothing on these Green Berets that died though.
[05:15:58.347 --> 05:15:59.748]  Hillary Clinton gets praised all day.
[05:15:59.768 --> 05:16:00.588]  A known criminal.
[05:16:00.829 --> 05:16:04.050]  Barack Obama, the President of the United States, campaigns for her all day long.
[05:16:04.210 --> 05:16:06.091]  All he cares about is Hillary Clinton getting an office.
[05:16:06.351 --> 05:16:07.512]  Doesn't even mention
[05:16:08.092 --> 05:16:10.695]  Chris Stevens can't vote, by the way.
[05:16:10.895 --> 05:16:15.821]  You know, he was tortured, raped, his genitals were cut off, he was set on fire.
[05:16:15.841 --> 05:16:17.883]  He was our ambassador to Libya.
[05:16:18.083 --> 05:16:19.325]  He can't vote in this election.
[05:16:19.725 --> 05:16:22.809]  I just wonder how he would vote if he were alive today and voting.
[05:16:23.129 --> 05:16:23.709]  Oh, but you know what?
[05:16:23.769 --> 05:16:32.511]  You can take solace in the fact that Hillary Clinton is going to make sure as many non-citizens and Obama are going to make sure as many non-citizens can vote in this country.
[05:16:32.671 --> 05:16:33.271]  What difference does it make?
[05:16:33.291 --> 05:16:38.892]  Just like Hillary Clinton made sure that Chris Stevens did not survive to tell the tales in Libya.
[05:16:39.272 --> 05:16:40.392]  Let's take another caller.
[05:16:40.972 --> 05:16:42.672]  Let's see, who's been holding the longest here?
[05:16:42.712 --> 05:16:47.753]  It looks like Tommy in Tennessee has been holding the longest.
[05:16:47.773 --> 05:16:48.673]  Thank you for holding, Tommy.
[05:16:48.713 --> 05:16:49.493]  What's on your mind tonight?
[05:16:50.314 --> 05:16:50.594]  Hey.
[05:16:51.114 --> 05:16:52.274]  How are you guys doing?
[05:16:53.100 --> 05:16:53.840]  We're doing all right.
[05:16:54.380 --> 05:16:55.581]  I about fell asleep there.
[05:16:55.601 --> 05:16:56.361]  Sorry about that.
[05:16:56.561 --> 05:16:57.241]  It's all right.
[05:16:57.301 --> 05:16:57.702]  It's late.
[05:16:58.342 --> 05:16:59.302]  Yeah, it is.
[05:16:59.682 --> 05:17:03.063]  But you know, that's why I'm here.
[05:17:03.503 --> 05:17:06.464]  You know, I got to come on here with a broken, contrived spirit.
[05:17:08.005 --> 05:17:18.969]  You know, I have a home church, and we have YouTube videos, and I have YouTube videos exposing Trump, and they have a lot of views.
[05:17:20.640 --> 05:17:24.163]  It's not anything that the mainstream media or anybody's ever put out.
[05:17:24.243 --> 05:17:25.484]  It's my own research.
[05:17:25.805 --> 05:17:36.794]  And, you know, I don't want to be responsible for being part of the 20 million evangelical Christians that might keep him out of the office.
[05:17:36.834 --> 05:17:46.262]  So, saying that, me and my mentor both, I'm not going to say his name, he's got millions of views exposing Trump.
[05:17:48.038 --> 05:17:50.440]  Now when you say exposing Trump, what do you mean exactly?
[05:17:52.181 --> 05:17:53.122]  What do you want to know?
[05:17:53.162 --> 05:17:54.623]  What I exposed him on?
[05:17:55.824 --> 05:17:56.525]  Yeah.
[05:17:57.025 --> 05:17:57.646]  You really do?
[05:17:58.706 --> 05:18:02.289]  You called into the show and you said you have videos exposing Trump.
[05:18:02.509 --> 05:18:04.451]  I was actually coming on to endorse him.
[05:18:04.931 --> 05:18:10.095]  But what he has done is not nothing compared to what I have seen over the last week.
[05:18:11.356 --> 05:18:12.597]  That's my point.
[05:18:13.158 --> 05:18:14.739]  I'm a registered Republican.
[05:18:14.779 --> 05:18:15.540]  I'm 40 years old.
[05:18:15.720 --> 05:18:17.161]  I have never voted for any
[05:18:18.132 --> 05:18:22.097]  Republican president ever or any president for that matter ever.
[05:18:23.319 --> 05:18:24.660]  He's technically an independent.
[05:18:24.680 --> 05:18:28.285]  Yeah.
[05:18:28.305 --> 05:18:29.346]  I mean he is.
[05:18:29.366 --> 05:18:31.529]  So you're calling in to endorse Trump
[05:18:32.678 --> 05:18:40.902]  Right, because I feel somewhat responsible because I have put out YouTube videos exposing him and they have tons of hits.
[05:18:41.482 --> 05:18:42.782]  Now I'm a little confused.
[05:18:42.842 --> 05:18:43.543]  I'm a little confused.
[05:18:43.603 --> 05:18:48.225]  Are you saying that originally you didn't like Trump and now you like Trump?
[05:18:48.325 --> 05:18:51.286]  Are you saying that... No, it's not even that I like Trump.
[05:18:51.386 --> 05:18:53.927]  It's just that this woman's so wicked.
[05:18:55.311 --> 05:18:57.674]  That we cannot let her in.
[05:18:57.714 --> 05:19:00.458]  It'll be the end of freedom of conscience.
[05:19:00.618 --> 05:19:01.799]  It'll be the end of religion.
[05:19:02.160 --> 05:19:03.602]  It will be the end of all of it.
[05:19:05.134 --> 05:19:07.956]  So you're like the opposite.
[05:19:08.037 --> 05:19:09.658]  You're on the opposite side of the spectrum.
[05:19:10.098 --> 05:19:16.744]  My guess is you're more based in reality than the people I'm talking about where they say that they have to vote Hillary in because they can't vote Trump in.
[05:19:16.784 --> 05:19:17.465]  He's so evil.
[05:19:18.025 --> 05:19:20.107]  So are you saying that... Trump's so evil.
[05:19:20.327 --> 05:19:21.648]  Trump's so evil.
[05:19:21.808 --> 05:19:28.554]  You're an evangelical, you're religious, you're a pastor, and you're saying essentially that
[05:19:29.935 --> 05:19:31.357]  Are you saying you have some regret?
[05:19:33.959 --> 05:19:37.643]  What I exposed is truth.
[05:19:38.484 --> 05:19:42.948]  Listen, five years ago, I called into the Alex Jones Show, exposed Ron Paul.
[05:19:44.130 --> 05:19:50.196]  And what I told on that show that David Mike Adams, three days later, Glenn Beck picked it up.
[05:19:51.002 --> 05:20:10.391]  And they say that it is the downfall of Ron Paul for what I exposed at how he was in cahoots with Barney Frank and it was all George Soros funded to cut the trillion dollars off the deficit and I've done the research I found it out and you know and after that it just went downhill.
[05:20:12.928 --> 05:20:17.051]  Well, I'm not really sure if I would agree with all that.
[05:20:17.191 --> 05:20:20.013]  I have not seen any evidence that points to anything you're saying.
[05:20:20.073 --> 05:20:20.914]  It's a fact.
[05:20:20.934 --> 05:20:22.074]  You can look it up.
[05:20:22.475 --> 05:20:22.575]  Yeah.
[05:20:22.595 --> 05:20:23.896]  You know, I did my research on it.
[05:20:23.916 --> 05:20:24.956]  I wouldn't lie about it.
[05:20:25.016 --> 05:20:33.042]  But, you know, regardless, you know, what I found on Trump, it's pretty bad, but it's nothing compared to what we have with Hellcat.
[05:20:33.943 --> 05:20:35.865]  Well, and that's the thing, and that's the thing, okay?
[05:20:36.665 --> 05:20:40.348]  No matter what you think about Trump, and I mean, I get it.
[05:20:40.448 --> 05:20:50.034]  If you're going into this election and you're saying, I can only vote with my moral conscience and because of that you can't vote for a billionaire playboy, you know what, that's one thing.
[05:20:50.075 --> 05:21:00.202]  But when you look at what could happen if Trump doesn't get in, and I think that this is what you're talking about, it's so bad that you realize what's at stake and there's so much
[05:21:01.262 --> 05:21:03.965]  Positive gravity behind the Trump movement.
[05:21:04.325 --> 05:21:07.088]  I think that you're saying that that's why ultimately you would vote for Trump.
[05:21:07.108 --> 05:21:08.029]  So thank you for the call.
[05:21:08.649 --> 05:21:13.153]  Tommy, I would have to disagree with everything that you said about Ron Paul.
[05:21:13.193 --> 05:21:14.314]  You claim you have the research.
[05:21:14.494 --> 05:21:17.277]  No, it's on y'all's archives.
[05:21:17.297 --> 05:21:18.018]  You can look it up.
[05:21:18.058 --> 05:21:19.319]  Mike Adams was the host.
[05:21:19.399 --> 05:21:20.480]  It was five years ago.
[05:21:20.800 --> 05:21:21.841]  And I called in.
[05:21:21.861 --> 05:21:27.286]  I told him everything Ron Paul's behind with his little cut the trillion dollar
[05:21:28.297 --> 05:21:43.976]  Gap with Marty Frank and it was all George Soros funded and after that Gwen Beck picked it up two days later or three after I said it on the Alex Jones Show and it became a nail in the coffin for Ron Paul's team.
[05:21:44.056 --> 05:21:47.821]  But you know here or there regardless this is their last chance and
[05:21:50.356 --> 05:21:51.157]  This is it.
[05:21:51.337 --> 05:21:55.600]  If we don't get him elected, then it's the end of common sense.
[05:21:55.640 --> 05:21:57.081]  It's the end of freedom of conscience.
[05:21:57.201 --> 05:21:58.342]  It's the end of religion.
[05:21:58.422 --> 05:22:00.664]  It's the end of our second right.
[05:22:00.784 --> 05:22:01.264]  It's over.
[05:22:01.284 --> 05:22:03.226]  All right, Tommy.
[05:22:03.266 --> 05:22:04.066]  Thank you for the call.
[05:22:04.086 --> 05:22:06.468]  Let's go out to Hector in Seattle.
[05:22:06.508 --> 05:22:07.229]  Go ahead, Hector.
[05:22:14.321 --> 05:22:21.025]  I'm a Mexican citizen, and I know this election seems... Hold on, Hector, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Hector, I didn't catch the first part of that.
[05:22:21.065 --> 05:22:21.846]  Go ahead, start over.
[05:22:22.766 --> 05:22:23.286]  Oh, thank you.
[05:22:23.767 --> 05:22:25.908]  So, yeah, I'm a Mexican citizen here.
[05:22:26.308 --> 05:22:28.430]  I've been living legally in the U.S.
[05:22:28.490 --> 05:22:29.610]  for 12 years.
[05:22:30.931 --> 05:22:35.574]  And this election seems so familiar to what I've been experiencing back home.
[05:22:36.292 --> 05:22:37.973]  Hector, can I stop you for a second?
[05:22:37.993 --> 05:22:39.713]  Are you a Trump supporter?
[05:22:56.058 --> 05:23:00.719]  You know, I'm not a Trump supporter or a Hillary supporter, but I like the truth.
[05:23:00.739 --> 05:23:02.940]  You just see media corruption propping up a candidate.
[05:23:03.180 --> 05:23:03.940]  I like the truth.
[05:23:04.040 --> 05:23:05.641]  And I know that they've been attacking Trump.
[05:23:06.201 --> 05:23:07.721]  And he's legit.
[05:23:08.381 --> 05:23:10.342]  Even though I don't, I can't even vote.
[05:23:10.502 --> 05:23:11.842]  I'm just a resident.
[05:23:13.823 --> 05:23:21.925]  But I can see how the media is playing the biggest part on confusing the public, especially in Mexico.
[05:23:21.945 --> 05:23:24.846]  Because in Mexico, even people like reporters that
[05:23:25.706 --> 05:23:26.306]  I don't know.
[05:23:55.509 --> 05:23:56.249]  We're good to go.
[05:24:25.697 --> 05:24:25.918]  Yes.
[05:24:29.707 --> 05:24:34.291]  You know, for the people that don't know what to do or how to take action, well, you know what?
[05:24:34.851 --> 05:24:37.513]  Go play some Alex Jones clips in public.
[05:24:37.694 --> 05:24:38.754]  That's a great idea.
[05:24:39.215 --> 05:24:40.936]  Play Mark Dice's clip.
[05:24:41.257 --> 05:24:42.438]  Play a Donald Trump speech!
[05:24:42.898 --> 05:24:44.299]  I did this at the RNC.
[05:24:44.759 --> 05:24:45.840]  Play a Donald Trump speech!
[05:24:46.181 --> 05:24:49.063]  Most of these Trump haters, folks, they don't pay attention.
[05:24:49.143 --> 05:24:50.824]  They've never heard a Donald Trump speech.
[05:24:51.185 --> 05:24:53.166]  All they see, they're drive-by media viewers.
[05:24:53.367 --> 05:24:58.391]  They tune into CNN, they see the couple of hacked up clips that make Trump look bad, and then they tune out!
[05:25:00.632 --> 05:25:20.125]  I've been triggering people because you know I play the clips where where Hillary is talking about the nuclear weapons that nice video that you guys made stuff like that just to quick quick bits because people won't pay attention so you only have a couple minutes to to give your message and say okay this is what it is
[05:25:21.565 --> 05:25:27.390]  And if enough people pick it up, then that's when you... Hector, I'm really encouraged by your incisiveness, honestly.
[05:25:27.410 --> 05:25:30.852]  I'm very encouraged that, you know, we have people listening that seem to get this.
[05:25:31.313 --> 05:25:41.421]  I just want to... I want to say this, Owen, and I'm sorry, I know you've got a lot to... If you want a Hillary Clinton presidency, get ready to engage in a military conflict with Russia, frankly.
[05:25:41.741 --> 05:25:43.482]  That's where we are with this.
[05:25:43.622 --> 05:25:52.346]  People need to understand how deadly she is, and she's about to assume the... I'm happy that somebody's awake.
[05:25:52.626 --> 05:26:05.012]  And I think that what Hector is saying has so much power to it because, you know, it's like, you know, for me, you know, everybody has a soft spot, right?
[05:26:05.593 --> 05:26:07.134]  I mean, everybody has something that
[05:26:08.422 --> 05:26:15.123]  Is going to impact them in a different way, whether it's this, that, or the other thing, I don't know.
[05:26:15.223 --> 05:26:17.684]  For me today, it was sitting here.
[05:26:17.704 --> 05:26:21.784]  Look, I've been listening to Alex Jones for five years, okay?
[05:26:22.545 --> 05:26:35.547]  I know what Alex Jones has reported on, but when I sat here today and I saw the artist renderings of the people who were at the scene when this young girl was abducted,
[05:26:36.741 --> 05:26:43.105]  And then you see, the renderings look exactly like the Podestas, exactly like Anthony Weiner.
[05:26:44.025 --> 05:26:50.349]  Again, this is all alleged, but you can look at the photos for yourself, it like, it hit me.
[05:26:50.549 --> 05:27:04.198]  It just, and then it hit me, like, I'm sitting here with Alex Jones, and two nights ago, and literally he can't even stop tears just rushing down his face every day he's crying, and I see this, and it just hits me.
[05:27:04.998 --> 05:27:06.740]  It just hits me like a ton of bricks!
[05:27:07.620 --> 05:27:12.225]  And I think that what Hector is saying is, people are still people.
[05:27:12.405 --> 05:27:15.547]  Even these brainwashed zombies, there's still a soft spot somewhere.
[05:27:15.928 --> 05:27:17.489]  They still have a soul somewhere.
[05:27:17.589 --> 05:27:19.391]  They still have a human spirit somewhere.
[05:27:19.791 --> 05:27:24.495]  It's been beaten almost to nothing, but it still has to be there somewhere.
[05:27:25.336 --> 05:27:50.817]  And if you can go out there, and you can play an Alex Jones Show, you can play a clip we made, you can play a clip from this, that, or the other thing, a Donald Trump speech, and if you can touch that soft spot, if you can make them feel again, if you can make them feel their soul, if you can reignite their spirit, that fire that humans have that's been put out, you can actually make a difference.
[05:27:50.858 --> 05:27:51.998]  I think you're so right, Hector.
[05:27:52.018 --> 05:27:52.339]  Go ahead.
[05:27:55.287 --> 05:27:59.971]  So important to even one, each person to wake up.
[05:28:00.452 --> 05:28:01.272]  It's so important.
[05:28:01.693 --> 05:28:06.397]  It's like you were saying earlier, that person talks to another person and you know, so on.
[05:28:06.938 --> 05:28:12.082]  So if you can wake up one person, then you're on the right track.
[05:28:12.563 --> 05:28:16.687]  And I can tell you, Hector, for you to go out in Seattle,
[05:28:17.671 --> 05:28:24.514]  And to play a Trump speech or an Alex Jones Show, my friend, you are in the belly of the beast.
[05:28:24.814 --> 05:28:27.195]  You are a brave man.
[05:28:27.435 --> 05:28:38.260]  Yeah, actually Hillary had a rally a few weeks ago there and I made a couple of clips and it was, I don't know, I couldn't count more than 500 people in the line.
[05:28:39.681 --> 05:28:45.203]  But I guarantee you, I guarantee you Hector, I guarantee you, you changed one person's life that day.
[05:28:46.974 --> 05:28:48.595]  Yes, sir.
[05:28:48.635 --> 05:28:58.258]  Thanks to Alex Jones, and you know, I want to promote Deep Cleanse and also Superman Mortality.
[05:28:58.298 --> 05:29:00.579]  I've tried those two, and they're amazing.
[05:29:00.859 --> 05:29:01.419]  Amazing.
[05:29:02.760 --> 05:29:07.261]  So, those are the ones that I already tried that I encourage people to check out.
[05:29:08.202 --> 05:29:09.722]  Well, thank you for your support, Hector.
[05:29:09.762 --> 05:29:11.763]  Thank you for the call, and I can agree.
[05:29:12.243 --> 05:29:13.824]  Infowarsstore.com, folks.
[05:29:16.001 --> 05:29:17.202]  I take Supermail Vitality.
[05:29:17.402 --> 05:29:17.942]  It's great.
[05:29:18.763 --> 05:29:20.845]  What are your favorite products, Margaret?
[05:29:21.345 --> 05:29:23.627]  You know, I don't take Supermail Vitality.
[05:29:23.967 --> 05:29:24.447]  You don't?
[05:29:24.487 --> 05:29:27.089]  I heard Jack's interview with you.
[05:29:27.149 --> 05:29:29.251]  Apparently, I owe him some brain force.
[05:29:29.291 --> 05:29:29.832]  That's right.
[05:29:29.852 --> 05:29:32.934]  I want to say this.
[05:29:32.994 --> 05:29:35.956]  When Owen started working... I stole her brain force, actually.
[05:29:35.996 --> 05:29:36.597]  You stole my brain force.
[05:29:37.317 --> 05:29:41.078]  I'm a thief!
[05:29:41.158 --> 05:29:43.919]  Anthony gave me another bottle and I'm going to send it to Jack.
[05:29:45.379 --> 05:29:53.341]  If I could ever manage to get my hands on a full bottle of Brain Force, it would be... Hey, they put 36 capsules in there now, folks.
[05:29:53.421 --> 05:29:53.681]  It says 30.
[05:29:53.721 --> 05:29:56.022]  There's 36 in the Brain Force that we're putting out now.
[05:29:56.062 --> 05:29:56.342]  Go ahead.
[05:29:57.402 --> 05:30:01.004]  We've got this product that's, it's essentially a B vitamin product.
[05:30:01.024 --> 05:30:02.744]  You put it under your tongue, it's sweet.
[05:30:03.024 --> 05:30:11.107]  You know, I have an issue with energy because sometimes, and I'm not a meat eater, and for those of us that, you know, have a sluggish aspect, are you laughing?
[05:30:11.247 --> 05:30:12.608]  He's laughing at me.
[05:30:13.048 --> 05:30:16.409]  I can try to channel some of my energy.
[05:30:18.986 --> 05:30:19.526]  Thank you.
[05:30:19.866 --> 05:30:29.513]  But honestly we sell these products because we love you and we want you to be healthy and I was talking to Dr. Group today about bad habits.
[05:30:29.613 --> 05:30:31.094]  Dr. Group is so awesome.
[05:30:31.134 --> 05:30:31.755]  He's so awesome.
[05:30:31.775 --> 05:30:33.276]  We were talking about addiction and how to
[05:30:33.356 --> 05:30:44.010]  You know, if you've got a smoking addiction, or if you drink too much, or if you maybe have depression, you know, whatever you're dealing with, we've designed things to kind of help you in this life.
[05:30:44.210 --> 05:30:46.393]  And that's, you know, it comes from a love.
[05:30:46.413 --> 05:30:47.514]  We love people, Owen.
[05:30:47.534 --> 05:30:48.395]  That's why we're doing this.
[05:30:48.455 --> 05:30:49.257]  That's why we're up in New Orleans.
[05:30:49.277 --> 05:30:50.238]  And we love ourselves, too!
[05:30:50.418 --> 05:30:52.459]  Look, I'm not going to lie.
[05:30:52.539 --> 05:30:53.340]  I like myself.
[05:30:53.420 --> 05:30:54.721]  I like being healthy.
[05:30:54.841 --> 05:30:55.642]  I like Margaret.
[05:30:55.902 --> 05:30:57.423]  I like everybody back there working.
[05:30:57.463 --> 05:30:58.744]  I want everybody to be happy.
[05:30:58.784 --> 05:31:00.005]  I want everybody to be healthy.
[05:31:00.045 --> 05:31:01.486]  There's nothing selfish about that.
[05:31:01.506 --> 05:31:04.368]  That's a natural survival instinct.
[05:31:04.648 --> 05:31:07.470]  Hey, can we actually pull up the InfoWars store website again?
[05:31:07.490 --> 05:31:08.430]  I wanted to see something.
[05:31:08.951 --> 05:31:13.694]  My favorite product is Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[05:31:13.794 --> 05:31:15.776]  I think that this is a must-have.
[05:31:16.216 --> 05:31:17.277]  And look at this, folks.
[05:31:17.837 --> 05:31:18.858]  I'm going to tell you something right now.
[05:31:20.503 --> 05:31:21.604]  We got free shipping running.
[05:31:22.584 --> 05:31:27.768]  Survival Shield X2 is on sale for $20.
[05:31:28.709 --> 05:31:27.768]  $20.
[05:31:28.869 --> 05:31:29.709]  I'm gonna tell you something.
[05:31:30.630 --> 05:31:42.938]  You spend $40 right now, and you get two bottles of Survival Shield, I promise you, that will be the best $40 you spent in that three, four, five month span that you have those bottles.
[05:31:43.498 --> 05:31:46.661]  That is the best $40 that you will spend all year.
[05:31:47.381 --> 05:31:50.803]  Spend 80, get four bottles, you'll be taking care of the whole year!
[05:31:50.823 --> 05:32:03.492]  And you will reignite your pineal gland, and at the end of that year, you will seriously feel your soul, feel your spirit, and you'll be able to think clearer, you'll have more energy when you wake up.
[05:32:03.512 --> 05:32:07.515]  I mean, I can't even tell you so many
[05:32:09.102 --> 05:32:10.523]  I don't even know what the word is.
[05:32:10.563 --> 05:32:19.750]  It's like imagine a car engine that has been weighed down by old oil that gets all sluggish and tarry.
[05:32:19.770 --> 05:32:23.713]  That's what the fluoride does to your pineal gland.
[05:32:24.134 --> 05:32:27.416]  And then the nascent iodine comes in there and it just cleans it up.
[05:32:27.456 --> 05:32:28.697]  It gets all that gunk out of there.
[05:32:28.757 --> 05:32:30.439]  It decalcifies your pineal gland.
[05:32:31.039 --> 05:32:32.300]  Thank you for taking my call.
[05:33:00.546 --> 05:33:08.731]  Before I get to my two-point mix, may I please put a plug out for a website I started, I mean a YouTube channel I started?
[05:33:08.751 --> 05:33:12.933]  Yep.
[05:33:14.514 --> 05:33:22.198]  Okay, basically for three years I've been making videos known as the InfoWords Newsletters.
[05:33:22.979 --> 05:33:27.801]  I cover about three articles on each one.
[05:33:27.881 --> 05:33:28.822]  Some of my videos are
[05:33:30.434 --> 05:33:30.754]  10 minutes.
[05:33:30.774 --> 05:33:36.898]  Some of them are about probably 15 minutes due to the fact of the clips I used.
[05:33:37.859 --> 05:33:40.001]  But basically they're very good.
[05:33:40.361 --> 05:33:41.161]  Good quality.
[05:33:41.181 --> 05:33:42.302]  Quality.
[05:33:42.342 --> 05:33:45.984]  So please, folks, please, uh, come.
[05:33:47.025 --> 05:33:49.647]  Please, please come take a look at my videos.
[05:33:49.727 --> 05:33:53.049]  My YouTube channel is Infodundam.
[05:33:53.109 --> 05:33:55.271]  That's I-N-F-O-D-U-N-D-A-M.
[05:33:58.542 --> 05:34:00.143]  Info, Infogunman?
[05:34:00.743 --> 05:34:01.944]  Infogundam?
[05:34:02.864 --> 05:34:04.465]  No, Infogundam.
[05:34:04.965 --> 05:34:06.726]  That's G-U-N-D-A-M.
[05:34:08.947 --> 05:34:10.408]  I'm sorry, I gotta be honest, O'Brien.
[05:34:10.448 --> 05:34:11.589]  Are you on a speakerphone or something?
[05:34:11.709 --> 05:34:12.749]  I'm having trouble hearing you.
[05:34:12.969 --> 05:34:13.590]  Is that just me?
[05:34:13.730 --> 05:34:15.371]  No, I'm not.
[05:34:16.931 --> 05:34:17.212]  Okay.
[05:34:18.192 --> 05:34:22.154]  So you said... Infogundam?
[05:34:23.175 --> 05:34:23.455]  Yes.
[05:34:24.455 --> 05:34:25.556]  Infogundam, okay.
[05:34:26.994 --> 05:34:29.335]  Now you wanted to call and talk about iCloud hacking?
[05:34:30.575 --> 05:34:41.557]  Yeah, basically what I found out was that one of these so-called celebrities didn't actually have their iCloud account hacked.
[05:34:42.197 --> 05:34:47.358]  You see, basically the person I'm talking about is Jennifer Lawrence.
[05:34:47.378 --> 05:34:54.240]  She said that she had her iCloud account hacked for technically about two weeks
[05:34:55.296 --> 05:34:57.678]  Into the whole scandal, she came out clean.
[05:34:57.698 --> 05:35:13.732]  Found a, whatchamacallit, a commenter who basically came out and just said basically she fully admitted it on Letterman and Conan and she lied about her iCloud account being hacked.
[05:35:13.773 --> 05:35:18.677]  And two weeks later she came out, she came clean that she leaked the whole
[05:35:24.266 --> 05:35:25.607]  You know, that doesn't shock me at all.
[05:35:25.627 --> 05:35:29.430]  You know, celebrities, naked pics of you, they get your fame.
[05:35:29.450 --> 05:35:32.252]  I mean, that kind of makes sense to me, doesn't it?
[05:35:32.712 --> 05:35:42.660]  Yeah, actually, you know, I don't want to, I don't like talking about that stuff because this is, you know, it's not like they're attacking me or anything, so I don't want to, you know, I don't want to allege that anybody does that kind of stuff.
[05:35:43.420 --> 05:35:45.602]  Um, you know, because I don't feel like it's an attack on me.
[05:35:45.943 --> 05:35:51.928]  But I've actually, I've actually had that same thought pattern, um, specifically, uh, with the Aaron Andrews tape.
[05:35:52.229 --> 05:35:52.449]  Yeah.
[05:35:52.489 --> 05:35:54.251]  Who made, ended up making millions of dollars.
[05:35:54.411 --> 05:35:58.895]  I've always thought that that was the strangest thing, how anything, how that whole event could even go down.
[05:35:58.915 --> 05:35:59.296]  Right.
[05:35:59.616 --> 05:36:05.241]  Um, and who, who, I'm sorry, who irons their clothes naked and stands around naked in the hotel anyway like that.
[05:36:05.261 --> 05:36:05.702]  Seriously.
[05:36:05.922 --> 05:36:07.724]  Um, but, but, but, but, but nonetheless, um,
[05:36:08.024 --> 05:36:11.005]  It's a good rule of thumb, though, just on a side note, never put naked photographs.
[05:36:11.145 --> 05:36:29.228]  But I'll tell you what, though, and the thing is, well, I completely, completely agree with that, and the thing is, you know, look, folks, we live in a day and age where, you know, look, I mean, somebody on the planet can probably hack my phone somehow, okay?
[05:36:29.268 --> 05:36:30.768]  Now, that somebody's not me.
[05:36:31.669 --> 05:36:33.749]  Actually, I, you know what, I actually, I actually
[05:36:34.733 --> 05:36:35.734]  I know people that can do this.
[05:36:35.774 --> 05:36:37.595]  They can get and they can hack into your phone.
[05:36:37.615 --> 05:36:39.476]  Oh, that's freakishly wrong.
[05:36:39.536 --> 05:36:40.156]  Oh, I hate that.
[05:36:40.336 --> 05:36:43.838]  And the point is... Here's my point.
[05:36:44.039 --> 05:36:45.900]  Don't have any weird crap on your stuff.
[05:36:45.960 --> 05:36:46.380]  No, no, no.
[05:36:46.460 --> 05:36:47.120]  Okay, don't.
[05:36:47.200 --> 05:36:49.021]  And if you do, put it somewhere else.
[05:36:49.582 --> 05:36:50.302]  Not illegal stuff.
[05:36:50.342 --> 05:36:51.483]  I'm just talking about stuff for you.
[05:36:51.503 --> 05:36:52.023]  But how about this?
[05:36:52.063 --> 05:36:54.064]  Because somebody's going to see it eventually.
[05:36:54.124 --> 05:36:54.725]  But how about this?
[05:36:56.218 --> 05:37:03.761]  If you're a high-ranking member of the United States government, and you have classified information, and you're too stupid... There we go.
[05:37:03.781 --> 05:37:04.941]  There we go, right here.
[05:37:05.021 --> 05:37:09.183]  You're too stupid to realize that this is hackable.
[05:37:09.343 --> 05:37:11.644]  Look, look, look, look, it's just like what Maggie was saying.
[05:37:11.664 --> 05:37:20.847]  Go to war with Russia if you can't prove that other... This woman's about to start a frickin' war with Russia because she can't admit her own blame, her own...
[05:37:23.088 --> 05:37:24.169]  Lack of depth.
[05:37:25.149 --> 05:37:26.050]  Is that what this is?
[05:37:26.110 --> 05:37:29.051]  Do you think that she is that stupid?
[05:37:29.171 --> 05:37:29.312]  I do.
[05:37:29.332 --> 05:37:30.552]  You really think she's that stupid?
[05:37:30.612 --> 05:37:31.833]  I think it's a lack of intelligence.
[05:37:31.853 --> 05:37:32.433]  Yes, I do.
[05:37:32.553 --> 05:37:37.496]  So you have, I mean, this is again, this is another, there's two realities that a Hillary Clinton voter has to embrace at this point.
[05:37:38.737 --> 05:37:48.324]  Either Hillary Clinton is so stupid and so ignorant, she doesn't even realize that having classified documents on a private, unsecured server is dangerous.
[05:37:48.364 --> 05:37:50.085]  She goes, he goes, look, she's ineffectual.
[05:37:50.105 --> 05:37:50.626]  That's true.
[05:37:50.666 --> 05:37:52.007]  She isn't very bright.
[05:37:52.587 --> 05:37:56.230]  We had an expert talking about her mental state.
[05:37:56.550 --> 05:37:57.991]  She's not as smart as she wants to be.
[05:37:58.011 --> 05:37:59.252]  She's angry about it.
[05:37:59.972 --> 05:38:01.814]  But let's say it's the, let's say it's the latter.
[05:38:01.854 --> 05:38:04.896]  Let's say that she is smart and she does know that this is going on.
[05:38:05.196 --> 05:38:05.456]  All right.
[05:38:05.516 --> 05:38:07.197]  Well, then she just blatantly broke the law.
[05:38:08.278 --> 05:38:11.481]  Or she intentionally set this up so she could be hacked.
[05:38:12.161 --> 05:38:15.844]  Basically an underground market for United States information.
[05:38:16.204 --> 05:38:17.725]  Donate to the Clinton campaign.
[05:38:18.045 --> 05:38:20.527]  I'm going to put this classified document on my private server.
[05:38:20.847 --> 05:38:21.868]  Feel free to hack!
[05:38:22.969 --> 05:38:24.770]  I mean, she's using Yahoo.
[05:38:25.250 --> 05:38:26.551]  Yahoo gets hacked, folks.
[05:38:27.512 --> 05:38:28.913]  We're talking about someone who knew.
[05:38:29.573 --> 05:38:30.874]  She knows, Owen.
[05:38:31.034 --> 05:38:32.395]  No, she knows.
[05:38:32.915 --> 05:38:38.438]  All the people that want to nuke us, all those dirty little secrets, all those threats, she knows them already.
[05:38:38.458 --> 05:38:49.665]  You know, we don't have a lot of access to that sort of information that our intel officer, she's got that information yet to be so ridiculously, I don't know, scatterbrained.
[05:38:49.705 --> 05:38:50.766]  What's the right word for this?
[05:38:52.647 --> 05:39:01.216]  I'm like on a tipping point where I can't decide if Hillary Clinton is, at this point, consciously evil.
[05:39:01.817 --> 05:39:06.021]  Or just a freaking idiot?
[05:39:06.461 --> 05:39:14.649]  At some point in time I'm sure she was a brainchild with evil, controlling Bill, manipulating a lot of this, probably a big shot caller back in the day.
[05:39:15.850 --> 05:39:25.913]  But at this point, I think that she's so unhealthy, so demented, so much brain damage, I mean, she might completely be a puppet, MKUltra mind control.
[05:39:25.933 --> 05:39:30.274]  I mean, we're looking at a total freak show, basically, is what I'm saying with Hillary Clinton.
[05:39:30.634 --> 05:39:39.716]  And I don't know if she's a total puppet, if she's consciously evil, but you can just tell by looking at her, seeing her body language, if I could get the... I mean, look at this freak!
[05:39:40.796 --> 05:39:43.857]  The image the other day of her in the rain, it's windy,
[05:39:45.290 --> 05:39:47.373]  This woman is a straight-up demon.
[05:39:47.394 --> 05:39:48.515]  I didn't see that, Owen.
[05:39:48.796 --> 05:39:49.717]  Can we get the image?
[05:39:50.098 --> 05:39:53.544]  Well, so she's... Maybe I can actually work on getting this.
[05:39:54.485 --> 05:39:55.166]  We're gonna take a break.
[05:39:55.186 --> 05:39:55.927]  Alright, here's what we're gonna do.
[05:39:56.820 --> 05:39:58.841]  We're going to stay live as long as you guys are calling in.
[05:39:58.881 --> 05:40:05.522]  We still got callers on the line.
[05:40:05.542 --> 05:40:06.303]  1-877-789-2539.
[05:40:06.323 --> 05:40:06.743]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[05:40:06.823 --> 05:40:07.543]  You can call in.
[05:40:07.683 --> 05:40:10.344]  I will be live as long as we still have people calling in.
[05:40:10.364 --> 05:40:11.344]  I'm going to take one call.
[05:40:11.684 --> 05:40:14.485]  Let's take Dave in Montana, and then we're going to take a quick break.
[05:40:14.505 --> 05:40:17.166]  We'll get back into the celebrities that will leave the country.
[05:40:17.806 --> 05:40:20.827]  I've got a video the other night, female-aged Skrillex.
[05:40:20.847 --> 05:40:21.467]  We'll talk about that.
[05:40:21.507 --> 05:40:22.407]  We'll talk more with Margaret.
[05:40:22.427 --> 05:40:23.087]  We'll take your calls.
[05:40:23.367 --> 05:40:24.628]  Let's go to Dave right now.
[05:40:24.688 --> 05:40:25.248]  Go ahead, Dave.
[05:40:25.788 --> 05:40:26.548]  Hey, I'm here.
[05:40:26.768 --> 05:40:27.088]  I'm here.
[05:40:27.168 --> 05:40:27.788]  Owen, are you there?
[05:40:27.808 --> 05:40:28.829]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[05:40:29.409 --> 05:40:30.129]  Good, good, good.
[05:40:30.409 --> 05:40:36.190]  Hey, I just want to say you're friggin' great, man.
[05:40:36.250 --> 05:40:38.411]  I mean... He is, isn't he?
[05:40:39.151 --> 05:40:40.131]  Thank you, Margaret.
[05:40:40.151 --> 05:40:41.331]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:40:41.671 --> 05:40:42.752]  No, and you are too.
[05:40:42.912 --> 05:40:46.592]  But the bottom line is, I'm an old enough dude to
[05:40:49.403 --> 05:40:52.666]  You know, I was going to vote for Ross Perot back in the day.
[05:40:53.147 --> 05:40:55.429]  You know, I was going to vote for Ron Ball!
[05:40:55.869 --> 05:40:57.571]  And now we have Donald Trump.
[05:40:58.452 --> 05:41:01.374]  And I live in the middle of nowhere, Montana.
[05:41:01.755 --> 05:41:04.457]  And tomorrow morning, I'm going to register to vote.
[05:41:04.697 --> 05:41:13.366]  And when you register to vote, you also register to go to court and be a juror and all, you know.
[05:41:15.127 --> 05:41:17.070]  I'm going to give you a little clue, okay?
[05:41:19.153 --> 05:41:26.603]  Listen, if you want to get out of jury duty... This is fail proof, folks.
[05:41:26.703 --> 05:41:27.724]  This is fail proof.
[05:41:27.864 --> 05:41:29.166]  If you want to get out of jury duty...
[05:41:29.787 --> 05:41:34.369]  When they start asking you questions to select their jurors, just say jury nullification.
[05:41:34.669 --> 05:41:38.770]  They will be so scared, they will keep you so far away from this jury.
[05:41:39.010 --> 05:41:45.193]  Trust me, just say the word jury nullification and they will make sure you are as far away from that court as possible.
[05:41:45.253 --> 05:41:45.593]  Go ahead.
[05:41:46.164 --> 05:41:47.885]  You know what, Owen?
[05:41:48.165 --> 05:41:50.405]  I don't want to be far away from the fire, man.
[05:41:50.486 --> 05:41:52.746]  I kind of like to throw another log on.
[05:41:53.046 --> 05:41:54.867]  See, but that's perfect!
[05:41:54.947 --> 05:41:55.547]  I love that!
[05:41:55.887 --> 05:41:56.888]  I love that, Dave!
[05:41:57.068 --> 05:41:57.908]  I'm not kidding ya!
[05:41:58.148 --> 05:41:59.509]  Listen, I'm gonna tell you a story.
[05:41:59.649 --> 05:42:01.229]  Okay, I was selected for jury duty.
[05:42:04.010 --> 05:42:04.110]  Yes.
[05:42:04.130 --> 05:42:19.798]  And the case was, and I didn't want to be in this jury, I had other stuff to do, but the case was basically you had a very, you know, unfortunate guy, probably grew up, you know, poor, you know, uneducated, and essentially he's a crackhead.
[05:42:20.518 --> 05:42:25.900]  And he got found on the streets and he had a little... Hey now, hey now, I'm taking offense to that.
[05:42:25.920 --> 05:42:27.241]  Sorry, keep going.
[05:42:27.481 --> 05:42:41.692]  So he gets caught on the sidewalk with a bag of crack and he gets arrested and I guess this was like his second or third time and so the judge is trying to put him in jail and all this stuff.
[05:42:41.832 --> 05:42:47.597]  Hillary Clinton's mandatory sentencing guideline right there.
[05:42:47.877 --> 05:42:50.619]  So I'm sitting here Dave and I'm thinking to myself, I'm like, you know,
[05:42:51.520 --> 05:43:00.863]  I could actually take a stand against the war on drugs here, pretend like I'm going to go along with these lawyers, and then just nullify this jury.
[05:43:01.143 --> 05:43:03.964]  Of course, then I'd be in deliberation for days and days and days.
[05:43:04.184 --> 05:43:08.885]  But this is the power of jury nullification, and lawyers know the power of jury nullification.
[05:43:09.126 --> 05:43:15.968]  And then the funniest thing was, I swear to God, man, when you be—look, it's like, information empowers you so much.
[05:43:17.188 --> 05:43:27.157]  They start asking me questions, and I basically go on a rant about how I think the war on drugs is a farce, and how I plan on nullifying this jury, basically.
[05:43:27.197 --> 05:43:32.482]  If I'm selected, I'm gonna nullify this jury, and I'm gonna make sure that this man does not go to jail for non-violent crimes.
[05:43:33.433 --> 05:43:44.255]  And so I go on this whole rant and they start asking me, of course they don't select me for the jury, and then afterwards when they let everybody out, everybody from the jury selection process was coming up to me.
[05:43:44.575 --> 05:43:45.395]  Are you a lawyer?
[05:43:45.415 --> 05:43:46.916]  You're so smart!
[05:43:46.956 --> 05:43:47.836]  How did you know all this?
[05:43:47.876 --> 05:43:48.216]  All this stuff.
[05:43:48.256 --> 05:43:49.976]  And I'm like, I'm just a regular guy.
[05:43:49.996 --> 05:43:50.777]  I just know the law.
[05:43:50.797 --> 05:43:51.657]  I just know my rights.
[05:43:51.717 --> 05:43:52.997]  It's really not that special.
[05:43:53.877 --> 05:43:55.638]  But most people have no idea.
[05:43:56.258 --> 05:43:57.218]  Most people have no idea.
[05:43:57.238 --> 05:44:02.339]  So Dave, if you want to throw a log on that fire, you can go in and you can nullify that jury.
[05:44:05.811 --> 05:44:08.394]  Do we still have Dave?
[05:44:08.754 --> 05:44:09.555]  I'm here.
[05:44:09.755 --> 05:44:10.095]  Are you here?
[05:44:10.115 --> 05:44:10.956]  Yeah, go ahead.
[05:44:11.517 --> 05:44:12.818]  Okay, cool.
[05:44:14.239 --> 05:44:16.181]  Look, I totally get it.
[05:44:17.002 --> 05:44:22.507]  It's time for Trump.
[05:44:22.687 --> 05:44:24.849]  There is no other vote.
[05:44:25.170 --> 05:44:27.012]  You can't vote for Hillary.
[05:44:27.452 --> 05:44:29.274]  You can't vote for Gary
[05:44:31.213 --> 05:44:31.854]  Johnson.
[05:44:31.874 --> 05:44:33.555]  Gary, what is Aleppo?
[05:44:33.676 --> 05:44:35.617]  I don't know a world leader, Johnson.
[05:44:35.637 --> 05:44:38.740]  Oh my God, I couldn't remember the guy's name.
[05:44:39.241 --> 05:44:44.626]  Aleppo is a metaphorical, it's a concept, Owen.
[05:44:44.706 --> 05:44:45.086]  It is.
[05:44:45.166 --> 05:44:48.189]  Well, it's actually, it's become him.
[05:44:48.269 --> 05:44:49.370]  He's now Aleppo.
[05:44:49.510 --> 05:44:50.151]  Oh, man.
[05:44:50.171 --> 05:44:51.592]  It's a concept.
[05:44:51.772 --> 05:44:52.533]  No, no, no, no.
[05:44:52.593 --> 05:44:52.953]  Wow.
[05:44:53.634 --> 05:44:55.416]  No, no, no, you are absolutely right.
[05:44:55.956 --> 05:44:57.698]  No, you can not!
[05:44:58.178 --> 05:44:59.599]  You can not!
[05:45:00.400 --> 05:45:01.221]  Holy Mother!
[05:45:01.401 --> 05:45:02.342]  I'm old enough!
[05:45:03.583 --> 05:45:06.926]  I voted for Ross Perot back in the day!
[05:45:06.946 --> 05:45:08.167]  Oh yeah!
[05:45:08.567 --> 05:45:09.908]  And Ron Paul!
[05:45:09.928 --> 05:45:11.650]  Yeah!
[05:45:12.911 --> 05:45:17.635]  Donald Trump took what Ron Paul couldn't do.
[05:45:17.795 --> 05:45:19.837]  But Donald Trump is a marketer.
[05:45:19.857 --> 05:45:21.418]  Ron Paul wasn't.
[05:45:23.759 --> 05:45:24.620]  You can't vote.
[05:45:24.740 --> 05:45:27.721]  You can't vote any other way.
[05:45:28.401 --> 05:45:29.802]  You're going to throw it away.
[05:45:30.202 --> 05:45:31.042]  You're going to throw it away.
[05:45:31.182 --> 05:45:37.645]  And I know it because I'm 54 years old and I've already played all the games, right?
[05:45:38.245 --> 05:45:43.947]  And now I've got headphones and a microphone and I am on InfoWars.com, all right?
[05:45:45.088 --> 05:45:47.709]  You understand that?
[05:45:48.029 --> 05:45:48.269]  No.
[05:45:49.190 --> 05:45:52.431]  It's Donald Trump and Donald Trump will
[05:45:52.998 --> 05:46:00.322]  Allow us to fight for another four more years if Hillary wins tomorrow.
[05:46:04.845 --> 05:46:19.774]  It's almost it's it's because if Hillary wins all of a sudden I think we're faced with something we've never wanted to actually be faced with and that's physical altercation might be the only way to take this country back.
[05:46:20.632 --> 05:46:22.553]  Honestly, Owen, I'm sorry.
[05:46:22.573 --> 05:46:24.954]  Man, well, no, I'm not sorry.
[05:46:25.014 --> 05:46:25.934]  I'm very proud.
[05:46:26.314 --> 05:46:29.035]  My son is your age, right?
[05:46:29.595 --> 05:46:31.416]  And you are brilliant.
[05:46:31.656 --> 05:46:37.058]  And if you can play bass guitar like my kid does, well, I'll tell you what, we'll step up.
[05:46:37.658 --> 05:46:42.139]  But no, it's time.
[05:46:42.159 --> 05:46:44.100]  And I'm so scared.
[05:46:45.601 --> 05:46:46.801]  And that's a big word.
[05:46:46.821 --> 05:46:49.282]  I'm scared because
[05:46:49.949 --> 05:47:02.394]  When I was growing up, three years ago, when I was working and building boats and driving forklifts, and I was 13 years old, I mean, I swear to God!
[05:47:03.454 --> 05:47:09.237]  You know, if OSHA would have known that I was driving forklifts!
[05:47:11.858 --> 05:47:12.118]  You know?
[05:47:13.018 --> 05:47:13.638]  Would have been the end.
[05:47:13.859 --> 05:47:24.106]  You know, it's funny, and hearing you talk about Trump, I had this weird image in my head, this weird little montage go by in my head.
[05:47:24.126 --> 05:47:36.195]  It's a scene from The Sandlot, where Porter, they all go to the pool, and Porter is walking by and all the ladies are sitting there, and he's kind of like,
[05:47:37.876 --> 05:47:38.837]  Like, eww.
[05:47:39.218 --> 05:47:42.341]  And all the ladies are, like, ignoring him, like, oh, you know, whatever.
[05:47:42.361 --> 05:47:46.085]  It's just a regular pool day ride, you know, everyone's sitting around, no big deal.
[05:47:46.105 --> 05:47:53.012]  And then Porter's walking around, waving at everyone, like, you know, I'm up to something here, you know, I'm up to something, but everyone's kind of ignoring him.
[05:47:53.433 --> 05:47:57.437]  And then he gets up on the diving board and he goes, CANNONBALL!
[05:47:57.737 --> 05:47:58.357]  I swear to God, man.
[05:47:58.417 --> 05:47:59.218]  I have to thank you.
[05:48:20.804 --> 05:48:27.607]  This is my, I'm a long-time InfoWars listener, and this is the second time I've ever been on the show.
[05:48:28.827 --> 05:48:33.148]  And I want you to tell Joe Biggs, Semper Fi, for me.
[05:48:33.669 --> 05:48:38.010]  Now, I never served, but my nephew served a couple of tours.
[05:48:39.211 --> 05:48:40.031]  Afghanistan.
[05:48:40.311 --> 05:48:44.032]  Taught me how to shoot guns, right?
[05:48:44.773 --> 05:48:45.813]  You tell Joe Biggs.
[05:48:47.715 --> 05:48:57.663]  Yeah, you just tell him Dave.
[05:48:57.783 --> 05:49:01.565]  I'm going to tell him that Dave called in from Montana and said Semper Fi.
[05:49:01.606 --> 05:49:03.247]  Dave from Montana, that's right.
[05:49:03.487 --> 05:49:10.352]  But the thing is, the whole gig is we got to elect Trump and all this stuff.
[05:49:10.432 --> 05:49:15.716]  And Margaret, I don't want to say Millennial Millie, I know that's wrong.
[05:49:16.670 --> 05:49:17.610]  Is she still there?
[05:49:17.650 --> 05:49:18.911]  I'm here, yes.
[05:49:19.051 --> 05:49:19.591]  I'm here.
[05:49:19.611 --> 05:49:21.472]  And it's Margaret, right?
[05:49:21.532 --> 05:49:22.693]  It's Margaret, yes.
[05:49:22.933 --> 05:49:23.593]  Yes, yes, yes.
[05:49:23.733 --> 05:49:25.074]  I'm so sorry.
[05:49:25.114 --> 05:49:26.774]  Can we get us confused?
[05:49:26.794 --> 05:49:28.815]  You know, we all have a love for the truth.
[05:49:28.855 --> 05:49:30.116]  We kind of look a little bit alike.
[05:49:30.196 --> 05:49:30.956]  It's totally fine.
[05:49:30.976 --> 05:49:31.877]  I'm not offended at all.
[05:49:31.957 --> 05:49:33.237]  And I love Millie Weaver.
[05:49:33.337 --> 05:49:36.299]  I'm so flattered to ever be confused with Millie Weaver.
[05:49:36.339 --> 05:49:37.059]  I can't tell you.
[05:49:37.259 --> 05:49:39.160]  It's a pleasure, honestly.
[05:49:39.551 --> 05:49:40.572]  You know what?
[05:49:41.553 --> 05:49:44.115]  You're the best of the best of the best, right?
[05:49:44.515 --> 05:49:50.460]  But the thing is, all of you guys at InfoWars, all the stuff you do.
[05:49:51.261 --> 05:49:52.441]  I was in Las Vegas.
[05:49:53.142 --> 05:49:57.466]  My first time calling in, I got to talk to David Knight, right?
[05:49:58.106 --> 05:49:58.446]  Okay?
[05:49:58.987 --> 05:50:05.312]  Now, I understand the Bundy situation down there, and you need to understand that
[05:50:06.810 --> 05:50:15.020]  Well, Geronimo was still alive when the Bundys got the least of the land.
[05:50:15.141 --> 05:50:20.667]  And you know, and it really with the Bundys, it just came down to for me, they're just standing up for their rights.
[05:50:20.687 --> 05:50:24.853]  They're just sick of the federal government controlling everything and they're just presenting themselves
[05:50:25.433 --> 05:50:27.995]  As an obstacle in the way of the federal government.
[05:50:28.015 --> 05:50:29.876]  That's what we the people are supposed to do to begin with.
[05:50:29.916 --> 05:50:31.317]  Thank you so much for the call, Dave.
[05:50:31.377 --> 05:50:34.318]  I'm gonna make sure to give Joe Biggs that message for you.
[05:50:34.399 --> 05:50:36.260]  Glad to have you as an InfoWarriors listener.
[05:50:36.660 --> 05:50:39.021]  Glad to have you called in tonight from Montana.
[05:50:39.442 --> 05:50:43.464]  Let's go out to Robert in Florida who has an opinion on Amy Schumer.
[05:50:43.484 --> 05:50:43.824]  Go ahead.
[05:50:44.765 --> 05:50:45.505]  Hi, can you hear me?
[05:50:45.725 --> 05:50:46.186]  Yep, go ahead.
[05:50:47.046 --> 05:50:49.187]  Okay, I'm also talking on behalf of my wife, Erica.
[05:50:49.207 --> 05:50:51.189]  I just wanted to give her a quick shout-out.
[05:50:51.869 --> 05:50:53.250]  Now, Amy Schumer
[05:50:53.942 --> 05:51:01.270]  Back when she just started out she was kind of the edgy comedian and she used to make jokes about her uncle molesting her.
[05:51:01.290 --> 05:51:05.015]  I think it has something to do with there's no wrong way to eat a Reese's.
[05:51:05.095 --> 05:51:08.479]  I wish my uncle would have told somebody would have told my uncle that.
[05:51:09.500 --> 05:51:10.781]  I'm just curious if
[05:51:11.940 --> 05:51:15.061]  What do y'all think about the possibility that she could be an MKUltra?
[05:51:16.361 --> 05:51:23.743]  That kind of makes sense to me because if somebody is incredibly promiscuous, it seems to be a pattern.
[05:51:23.883 --> 05:51:27.784]  Often times there is a history of some sort of sexual abuse.
[05:51:28.064 --> 05:51:35.786]  I think that the psychology behind somebody who was sexually abused as a young child unfortunately is very weak.
[05:51:37.586 --> 05:51:44.529]  And they can be easily manipulated, taken advantage of, even blackmailed to an extent.
[05:51:44.649 --> 05:51:46.430]  So that could certainly be going on.
[05:51:46.610 --> 05:51:49.431]  I don't know much about Amy Schumer's history.
[05:51:49.631 --> 05:51:54.433]  I feel bad if she was really molested by her uncle and she's so tormented.
[05:51:54.493 --> 05:51:55.634]  Isn't her uncle Chuck Schumer?
[05:51:55.654 --> 05:52:00.496]  I mean, I'm not sure which uncle she was referring to, but she does have an uncle in the Senate.
[05:52:01.124 --> 05:52:02.245]  Her uncle is Chuck?
[05:52:03.225 --> 05:52:04.926]  I mean, I don't know what the reference is here.
[05:52:04.966 --> 05:52:06.487]  I wasn't familiar with this story.
[05:52:06.507 --> 05:52:09.088]  I've only seen one movie with Amy Schumer.
[05:52:09.108 --> 05:52:10.048]  That makes sense.
[05:52:10.148 --> 05:52:15.551]  I had to turn it off after 20 minutes and frankly it's so annoying that the woman thinks that she's qualified to comment.
[05:52:15.911 --> 05:52:20.833]  Well look, and if you've been... See, and that's the thing too, where... As a political expert.
[05:52:21.494 --> 05:52:25.876]  If you've been taken advantage of sexually as a young child, you have a
[05:52:26.880 --> 05:52:43.914]  A feeling of hopelessness, you feel like you basically have never had a feeling of empowerment because you've been dominated at a young age and you don't really have it within yourself to empower yourself.
[05:52:44.114 --> 05:52:46.295]  So perhaps you could have a situation here where
[05:52:47.409 --> 05:52:50.670]  She feels empowered by the fake celebrity status she's given.
[05:52:50.750 --> 05:52:58.112]  She feels empowered that she can go out here and basically be a mouthpiece for the establishment and that empowers her.
[05:52:58.712 --> 05:53:01.573]  So that's certainly a potential there, Robert.
[05:53:01.613 --> 05:53:02.494]  Thank you for the call.
[05:53:02.894 --> 05:53:09.115]  Like I said, I'm not really familiar with Amy Schumer or her alleged uncle abusing her.
[05:53:09.135 --> 05:53:10.676]  She said she made jokes about it.
[05:53:10.976 --> 05:53:13.458]  I mean, this is the first time I'd ever heard of that.
[05:53:13.938 --> 05:53:16.499]  I'm not really familiar with Amy Schumer myself, personally.
[05:53:16.519 --> 05:53:22.103]  Like I've said, I was dragged to one movie on a date a long time ago, and I don't really know her work.
[05:53:22.463 --> 05:53:32.469]  I know her tweets, though, about Donald Trump because Owen has covered them, frankly, but it's been, you know, that would be my only reference to Amy Schumer is her political discourse.
[05:53:32.929 --> 05:53:34.390]  Well, you know, and I mean, I guess, you know,
[05:53:36.533 --> 05:53:42.856]  I guess, you know, I'm a jerk if I'm actually up here, you know, making fun of somebody who was molested by her uncle.
[05:53:42.916 --> 05:53:52.660]  But I mean, just because you were molested by your uncle doesn't mean that you have to go empower yourself by being part of a giant brainwashing psyop on the rest of the American public.
[05:53:52.820 --> 05:53:59.643]  And again, unfortunately for childhood victims like this, there is a lack of
[05:54:01.573 --> 05:54:21.431]  Individual empowerment or the ability to feel empowered by yourself because you were dominated at a young age So I could see there being you know, somebody behind her trying to empower her and use that against her Of course, we know that this is how the predators at the top operate through blackmail and they find Psychological issues within people that they know that they can manipulate.
[05:54:21.451 --> 05:54:24.414]  So that's a very that's a very serious possibility Robert Thank you for the call.
[05:54:24.754 --> 05:54:27.216]  Let's go to Chuck in Texas.
[05:54:27.256 --> 05:54:27.777]  Go ahead Chuck
[05:54:29.448 --> 05:54:30.549]  Hey guys, how are y'all doing?
[05:54:30.869 --> 05:54:31.710]  Doing good.
[05:54:33.231 --> 05:54:33.871]  Hey, you know what?
[05:54:34.092 --> 05:54:35.232]  I've got a lot of stuff to cover.
[05:54:35.292 --> 05:54:40.036]  I've been sitting here taking a lot of notes on what's been going on in the show this evening.
[05:54:40.276 --> 05:54:42.718]  I don't even know where to start.
[05:54:42.758 --> 05:54:46.361]  I mean, the beautiful Margaret, she talked about Kim Kardashian.
[05:54:46.381 --> 05:54:52.385]  These people are, you know, I don't even understand the brainwashing that goes on with these people.
[05:54:53.666 --> 05:54:59.650]  You hear them talk, and you think that, you know, I mean, you just can't be that stupid, these people.
[05:54:59.770 --> 05:55:04.713]  I mean, what are your thoughts on a lot of these celebrities coming out?
[05:55:04.973 --> 05:55:06.694]  It sort of anesthetizes you.
[05:55:06.814 --> 05:55:11.457]  It's sort of like a numbing, or almost like taking a medicine to be able to check out.
[05:55:11.497 --> 05:55:14.879]  You watch enough of that, and it's sort of numbing.
[05:55:15.160 --> 05:55:19.122]  Well, and my question is, it's kind of like what you were just alluding to, Chuck.
[05:55:19.142 --> 05:55:21.504]  It's like, I mean, I only see two ways this goes.
[05:55:23.151 --> 05:55:31.894]  These celebrities that are coming out against Trump like this, either they're just as brainwashed as the general public, or they're part of the PSYOP.
[05:55:32.355 --> 05:55:34.215]  I mean, that's the way that I view this.
[05:55:34.756 --> 05:55:38.877]  And for someone like Beyoncé, we know what she is.
[05:55:39.297 --> 05:55:41.498]  I mean, we know Beyoncé— Did you see this?
[05:55:41.518 --> 05:55:46.800]  $62 million, that's what's come out, reportedly that she and Jay-Z were paid to push Clinton.
[05:55:46.940 --> 05:55:48.761]  It's an insane amount of money.
[05:55:48.781 --> 05:55:50.482]  Here's the thing— I wish that I'd brought this with me.
[05:55:52.100 --> 05:56:00.985]  The propaganda, they've got to pay insane amounts of money to push Clinton on people because she's not she's not likable enough.
[05:56:01.005 --> 05:56:01.726]  There we go.
[05:56:01.746 --> 05:56:03.127]  Oh, and you know what?
[05:56:03.167 --> 05:56:06.429]  This is the same Hillary Clinton that says that she's all about you.
[05:56:06.929 --> 05:56:09.850]  She's all about fixing what's wrong in America.
[05:56:10.111 --> 05:56:11.671]  She says she's all about the children.
[05:56:11.692 --> 05:56:17.255]  62 million to a family worth more than a billion dollars.
[05:56:18.275 --> 05:56:20.377]  I'm not sure how that equates to caring about the children.
[05:56:20.397 --> 05:56:21.518]  But I will say this, look.
[05:56:22.678 --> 05:56:24.900]  It's no doubt who Jay-Z and Beyonce are.
[05:56:26.201 --> 05:56:31.064]  Beyonce does a performance for Hillary Clinton and she has a Baphomet ring on her finger.
[05:56:31.104 --> 05:56:32.165]  But I'll tell you this, folks.
[05:56:33.686 --> 05:56:34.807]  I'm really big into music.
[05:56:35.667 --> 05:56:41.571]  And I've always been, at least recently, big into finding hidden messages in music because
[05:56:42.719 --> 05:56:58.951]  A lot of these artists, you know, they might not be able to speak their mind on a public platform, but they put messages in their lyrics, folks, that they feel like they can either get a message to you via their lyrics, or perhaps try to get some sort of weird brainwashing twist on you.
[05:56:58.971 --> 05:57:00.512]  But I'm going to say something.
[05:57:00.532 --> 05:57:07.117]  Jay-Z's album, Holy Grail, if you listen to that album, it's basically
[05:57:08.396 --> 05:57:11.458]  Telling you the New World Order is here to take you out.
[05:57:12.199 --> 05:57:14.300]  Basically, the entire album.
[05:57:14.320 --> 05:57:21.705]  I mean, like almost every song, you're gonna find a lyric that's like, we're here, the New World Order's here, you better get ready.
[05:57:21.805 --> 05:57:25.067]  Like, it's real, it's here, we're in control.
[05:57:25.087 --> 05:57:26.448]  It's like the whole album.
[05:57:26.488 --> 05:57:28.870]  And I remember listening to this, this was like four years ago.
[05:57:31.156 --> 05:57:35.441]  But my point is, people like Jay-Z and Beyonce know exactly what's going on.
[05:57:35.461 --> 05:57:36.702]  They're certainly a part of it.
[05:57:37.022 --> 05:57:40.246]  If you see them campaigning for Clinton, it's because they're shills for the new old order.
[05:57:40.726 --> 05:57:45.611]  Someone like Amy Schumer, I just assumed was some sort of a total hack.
[05:57:46.328 --> 05:58:00.394]  Who just thought the only way for her to make it in the industry, considering she's ugly and not funny, was to sell out to the people in control who handle her, to push whatever message they want, and then she gets the TV contract, she gets the movie deals.
[05:58:00.854 --> 05:58:01.895]  This is how Hollywood works.
[05:58:02.395 --> 05:58:12.940]  But, as Chuck was saying, we also have to take a look and we say, are these celebrities brainwashed fools, like the rest of the public, or are they part of the establishment?
[05:58:14.448 --> 05:58:15.469]  Here you go.
[05:58:15.549 --> 05:58:16.849]  Let me put this out here, okay?
[05:58:16.949 --> 05:58:18.230]  Are they really brainwashed?
[05:58:18.250 --> 05:58:25.775]  Or are they just afraid to... ...to... ...not... ...fight the hand that feeds them?
[05:58:26.055 --> 05:58:26.935]  I mean, literally.
[05:58:26.955 --> 05:58:27.576]  Look at this!
[05:58:27.616 --> 05:58:28.496]  There's another artist!
[05:58:28.516 --> 05:58:29.357]  Here's another artist!
[05:58:30.297 --> 05:58:32.318]  Bobby Ray, known as B.O.B.
[05:58:32.398 --> 05:58:33.499]  You've probably heard of him.
[05:58:34.079 --> 05:58:35.220]  He first starts coming up.
[05:58:35.520 --> 05:58:36.361]  Very popular.
[05:58:37.121 --> 05:58:38.442]  Then he hits it mainstream.
[05:58:38.822 --> 05:58:43.165]  He gets put on almost every track that goes on the mainstream radio networks.
[05:58:43.185 --> 05:58:43.765]  The big hits.
[05:58:44.125 --> 05:58:45.866]  Oh well, it's Illuminati confirmed.
[05:58:45.906 --> 05:58:47.568]  I mean, all the kids are saying it.
[05:59:05.373 --> 05:59:07.754]  I'm not sitting here saying that I agree with everything B.O.B.
[05:59:07.794 --> 05:59:14.798]  says in his songs, but he comes out with an album, that's actually the album with the three heads on it, Psychedelic Thoughts is the name of that album.
[05:59:15.398 --> 05:59:27.764]  He drops this album, telling you how the government lies, telling you how the mainstream media lies, telling you how the whole New World Order is real and here to control you, and then he's dropped from every major hit
[05:59:27.984 --> 05:59:31.927]  That he used to get put on on the radio that you listen to in your car.
[05:59:32.227 --> 05:59:35.750]  And this is just the kind of stuff that I noticed being a fan of music, but it's very real.
[05:59:35.950 --> 05:59:36.250]  Go ahead.
[05:59:37.351 --> 05:59:38.932]  Well, it's strange to how that happens.
[05:59:39.012 --> 05:59:41.014]  I mean, you know, I have a 12 year old.
[05:59:41.034 --> 05:59:41.574]  He comes home.
[05:59:41.614 --> 05:59:44.497]  He says, you know, one day he says to me, Illuminati confirmed.
[05:59:44.537 --> 05:59:45.838]  I said, do you even know what that means?
[05:59:46.358 --> 05:59:46.879]  He says, no.
[05:59:46.899 --> 05:59:49.300]  He said, but this is what all the kids are saying.
[05:59:49.320 --> 05:59:52.483]  I mean, I'm paraphrasing here, but this is exactly what he's talking about.
[05:59:52.503 --> 05:59:57.807]  He's like, ah, you know, everybody, all, you know, all the artists are saying it's Illuminati confirmed, Illuminati confirmed.
[05:59:58.376 --> 06:00:02.377]  Well, I mean, you know, what's going on here with these kids?
[06:00:02.497 --> 06:00:12.561]  I mean, what, you know, I had to, I had to literally go through his whole music index to figure out, you know, where are you hearing this stuff from, you know?
[06:00:13.141 --> 06:00:16.902]  And so you notice how they say these things and then
[06:00:17.458 --> 06:00:20.940]  You know, nothing's really done about it, nothing's really said about it.
[06:00:21.040 --> 06:00:23.301]  I mean, I don't know what to think anymore, really.
[06:00:23.401 --> 06:00:24.181]  I mean, honestly.
[06:00:24.621 --> 06:00:25.742]  Well, at least you're thinking.
[06:00:25.962 --> 06:00:29.063]  I mean, that's, you know, that's that's where it all starts.
[06:00:29.103 --> 06:00:31.544]  You have to, yeah, you have to be willing to think for yourself.
[06:00:31.704 --> 06:00:35.746]  You have to have a free thought pattern and you have to, you know what?
[06:00:36.326 --> 06:00:44.314]  Dig your toes in to the mud sometimes and stand there and take all the heat, take all the bows and arrows that are slung at you for being an individual free thinker.
[06:00:44.334 --> 06:00:46.196]  But that's what we do here at Infowars.com.
[06:00:46.416 --> 06:00:47.397]  And we're here for you!
[06:00:47.417 --> 06:00:51.321]  I mean, that's when I first woke up and I started listening to Alex Jones.
[06:00:51.341 --> 06:00:51.682]  That was it.
[06:00:51.702 --> 06:00:51.962]  It was like...
[06:00:52.262 --> 06:00:53.863]  Oh my god, I'm not alone!
[06:00:54.224 --> 06:01:00.949]  All of these thoughts that have been in my head that I haven't been able to speak or put into words or connect the dots, it's there, it's real.
[06:01:01.049 --> 06:01:01.829]  I'm not alone.
[06:01:01.869 --> 06:01:03.411]  There are other humans out there.
[06:01:03.751 --> 06:01:07.694]  There are other people that put these glasses on that know what's going on.
