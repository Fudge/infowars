[00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.515]  Are you gonna be part of history?
[00:00:02.077 --> 00:00:05.088]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you!
[00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.152]  Take action!
[00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.070]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.011]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[00:00:11.091 --> 00:00:13.811]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:14.832]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:17.692]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:00:17.732 --> 00:00:20.933]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.973 --> 00:00:22.293]  Deeply I think racist.
[00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:24.233]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.134]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[00:00:26.154 --> 00:00:30.235]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:31.415]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:31.475 --> 00:00:36.396]  Watch the free stream live at inforce.com forward slash show.
[00:00:37.355 --> 00:00:44.725]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:52.875]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:55.258]  As president, I will make it clear.
[00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:00.864]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:06.791]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:09.834]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:13.198]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[00:01:13.258 --> 00:01:15.821]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.213]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[00:01:20.593 --> 00:01:23.996]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[00:01:24.276 --> 00:01:32.163]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:34.553]  The U.S.
[00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:38.216]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[00:01:38.576 --> 00:01:46.182]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[00:01:46.563 --> 00:01:48.904]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[00:01:48.924 --> 00:01:53.148]  Of course not, because she's... Hang on guys, look, there's a really loud noise.
[00:01:53.568 --> 00:01:57.651]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[00:01:57.671 --> 00:01:59.873]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:08.171]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:38.822]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:02:39.082 --> 00:02:40.383]  You can't survive without it.
[00:02:40.583 --> 00:02:41.484]  But where do you get it?
[00:02:41.784 --> 00:02:47.528]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:53.472]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:02:53.672 --> 00:03:10.556]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:03:10.796 --> 00:03:11.496]  Sound 1, we have one Chevy.
[00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:17.927]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[00:04:19.228 --> 00:04:21.350]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:50.297]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:50.358 --> 00:05:53.444]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[00:05:54.244 --> 00:05:56.065]  And they're also very affordable.
[00:05:56.085 --> 00:05:56.425]  Exactly.
[00:05:56.445 --> 00:05:58.226]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[00:05:58.246 --> 00:06:01.588]  You talk about... We're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:02.769]  We've both talked to them.
[00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:12.054]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[00:06:12.934 --> 00:06:14.035]  We refuse to screw people.
[00:06:14.375 --> 00:06:15.335]  We refuse to do that.
[00:06:15.715 --> 00:06:17.757]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[00:06:17.937 --> 00:06:19.978]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us.
[00:06:20.578 --> 00:06:24.959]  And it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:26.140]  It's a win-win.
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.640]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:33.842]  BrainForce is here.
[00:06:34.362 --> 00:06:36.643]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:06:36.923 --> 00:06:44.725]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:06:45.512 --> 00:06:48.654]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:06:48.954 --> 00:06:49.095]  Right?
[00:06:49.115 --> 00:06:51.456]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:06:51.816 --> 00:06:55.359]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:58.521]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:06:59.022 --> 00:07:03.805]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:07:04.365 --> 00:07:06.187]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:07:06.547 --> 00:07:10.970]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.131]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:07:13.752 --> 00:07:15.213]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:07:15.373 --> 00:07:15.613]  Exactly.
[00:07:15.633 --> 00:07:19.415]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:07:19.935 --> 00:07:27.939]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:07:32.739 --> 00:07:41.742]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:07:41.842 --> 00:07:50.065]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:07:50.245 --> 00:07:54.947]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:07:55.127 --> 00:07:58.769]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:00.789]  We're good to go.
[00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:30.084]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great-tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:08:30.264 --> 00:08:31.984]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:38.746 --> 00:08:41.487]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:08:41.747 --> 00:08:42.127]  We think.
[00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:42.687]  Just let me think.
[00:08:42.707 --> 00:08:48.249]  In fact, even now, orders are being shoutsed into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:48.969]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[00:08:51.385 --> 00:08:57.387]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:08:57.968 --> 00:09:03.470]  Words are for the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
[00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:08.752]  But the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:09:08.772 --> 00:09:09.772]  You decided, sir.
[00:09:09.812 --> 00:09:10.732]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:09:10.752 --> 00:09:12.153]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:09:12.393 --> 00:09:15.874]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and depression.
[00:09:16.294 --> 00:09:20.016]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit,
[00:09:20.576 --> 00:09:26.259]  You now have sensors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:26.419]  Cameras.
[00:09:26.459 --> 00:09:26.839]  We need cameras.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.900]  How did this happen?
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.401]  Who's to blame?
[00:09:30.381 --> 00:09:33.003]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:09:33.023 --> 00:09:34.844]  They will be held accountable.
[00:09:34.864 --> 00:09:40.787]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:09:41.986 --> 00:09:43.707]  I know why you did it.
[00:09:43.967 --> 00:09:45.048]  I know you were afraid.
[00:09:45.068 --> 00:09:46.188]  Who would it be?
[00:09:46.708 --> 00:09:47.149]  War?
[00:09:47.469 --> 00:09:47.849]  Terror?
[00:09:48.109 --> 00:09:48.749]  Disease?
[00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:55.272]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:09:55.853 --> 00:10:01.615]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:10:02.236 --> 00:10:08.379]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:10:15.131 --> 00:10:16.331]  There is a war.
[00:10:16.812 --> 00:10:17.772]  It's happening now.
[00:10:18.672 --> 00:10:20.473]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:10:21.033 --> 00:10:22.853]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:10:23.633 --> 00:10:25.074]  We are the resistance.
[00:10:25.534 --> 00:10:27.234]  We are the Infowar.
[00:10:27.715 --> 00:10:35.057]  That's right, there's nothing wrong.
[00:10:35.157 --> 00:10:38.998]  You don't need the objective ability to decide what's fact and fiction.
[00:10:39.738 --> 00:10:41.078]  That's kind of an epic intro.
[00:10:41.218 --> 00:10:43.239]  Kind of funny, but at the same time, pretty powerful, right?
[00:10:44.005 --> 00:10:50.769]  You know, we're kind of breaking in, like diving in, nose-diving into this 52-hour amazing broadcast, livestream.
[00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.271]  I say it's amazing because it's historic, right?
[00:10:53.311 --> 00:11:10.402]  No matter how you slice it, the insanity, the kind of, the drama, the precipice we have arrived to now, that within the next day, right, within these next 52 hours, we're already about six, seven hours into it, there will be a decision made, right?
[00:11:10.422 --> 00:11:12.163]  There will be a decision made, or at least a decision.
[00:11:13.044 --> 00:11:13.224]  I think?
[00:11:33.852 --> 00:11:35.973]  Now, they'll differ on reasons why.
[00:11:36.053 --> 00:11:37.815]  You know, you could say, oh, well, look at Donald Trump.
[00:11:37.855 --> 00:11:38.895]  He's not a politician.
[00:11:38.955 --> 00:11:41.197]  He comes as a businessman.
[00:11:41.217 --> 00:11:42.678]  He comes and he shakes things up.
[00:11:42.758 --> 00:11:44.019]  Or you could say, look at Hillary.
[00:11:44.339 --> 00:11:48.601]  You know, she's amid all of the scandals still in this thing, whatever it is.
[00:11:49.142 --> 00:12:01.450]  But the real point of fact as to why this is such an amazing election in both the good and negative ways, but primarily the good way, is that it is shaking things up.
[00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.410]  Right?
[00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:20.359]  Just imagine the concept of everyone just sitting around and we kind of know stuff's messed up and we're kind of sure there's massive corruption and kind of like these articles we have here that we're going to go through like the Haitians begging people not to give money to the American Red Cross because they got a billion dollars and made six houses.
[00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.551]  Or the Clinton Foundation.
[00:12:23.071 --> 00:12:26.773]  Like, please, like, don't give them money because they're not actually doing anything.
[00:12:27.213 --> 00:12:30.715]  And we have all these headlines we read all the time, all this crazy stuff.
[00:12:30.775 --> 00:12:32.516]  I mean, truly, truly insane stuff.
[00:12:32.936 --> 00:12:37.479]  Like a mother of six jailed for challenging Saudi taboos, talking about beards.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.340]  We have people like...
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.980]  See if the NSA is tracking you.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.241]  A Canadian journalist found out that he was being tracked constantly on his phones.
[00:12:45.501 --> 00:12:46.682]  Just endless stuff, right?
[00:12:47.102 --> 00:12:48.982]  But it kind of just whizzes by.
[00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:56.184]  It's like if you're going really high speeds, like you're on a motorcycle and you're going like 120 miles an hour, there's like bugs flying by, gnats, all this crazy stuff.
[00:12:56.224 --> 00:12:59.105]  You can't really stop and analyze what it is.
[00:12:59.125 --> 00:13:00.265]  It just kind of flies by.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:08.004]  Well, since we're going at such high speeds intellectually, ideologically, there's just like so much news constantly every single day.
[00:13:08.284 --> 00:13:12.906]  If you go on any major news website or you go on Reddit or whatever, it's just a massive attack.
[00:13:12.986 --> 00:13:14.647]  You don't even remember what happened a week ago.
[00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:28.535]  It's to the information overload point where I don't even know what I was doing sometimes a week ago because I'm constantly filtering out all the stuff that's happening and trying to make sense of it and processing it, right?
[00:13:29.215 --> 00:13:30.115]  So we get overloaded.
[00:13:30.495 --> 00:13:51.360]  But what's happened with the 2016 election that I think is so insurmountably important is that through the mechanism of Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton, the completely scandal-ridden person that she is, we've been kind of taken the cage and just like rattled it as hard as possible.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.221]  Just the system is in total chaos.
[00:13:56.201 --> 00:14:06.346]  And the society that we live in, America, everyone listening right now, is pissed off because we've been sold a lie, we bought the lie, and then we realized, wow, maybe this isn't what we wanted.
[00:14:06.426 --> 00:14:08.847]  Maybe this isn't what freedom looks like.
[00:14:08.887 --> 00:14:12.909]  Maybe this isn't the utopia that we've been told it is, right?
[00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:17.652]  And then you have someone like Donald Trump come along, and he's saying the populist concepts, a lot of them,
[00:14:18.252 --> 00:14:21.255]  And it starts a complete ideological wildfire.
[00:14:21.636 --> 00:14:34.989]  So whether or not you totally agree with all the things he says, whether or not you agree with every one of his positions, or the things he said or whatever, and everyone is messed up and screwed up in many ways, I certainly don't agree with everything about him.
[00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.372]  The point is, it's going to a new level.
[00:14:37.392 --> 00:14:38.313]  We've got some breaking noise.
[00:14:38.553 --> 00:14:39.154]  Yes, come on in.
[00:14:52.074 --> 00:14:52.595]  That's right.
[00:15:15.293 --> 00:15:16.354]  And actually break it on here.
[00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:20.877]  But yeah, coming up, Dr. Group's going to come on and talk about some of this news too.
[00:15:20.917 --> 00:15:24.319]  We've got a new superbug that's actually a fungus spot in the U.S.
[00:15:24.379 --> 00:15:27.061]  I think it's been responsible for four deaths and a lot of other health news too.
[00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:28.402]  But yeah, exactly.
[00:15:28.882 --> 00:15:30.263]  That's case in point.
[00:15:31.524 --> 00:15:32.585]  Perfect case in point.
[00:15:33.105 --> 00:15:35.266]  Running in with WikiLeaks news about this.
[00:15:35.426 --> 00:15:43.852]  It is over-the-top craziness at a level never seen before with WikiLeaks getting involved with a complete, just utter
[00:15:45.513 --> 00:15:50.157]  Madness, considering all the things that come out and then no one, theoretically no one, right?
[00:15:50.297 --> 00:15:51.759]  People do actually care, obviously.
[00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:56.182]  Like we were talking about earlier on the show, if you're watching, the independent media is huge.
[00:15:56.743 --> 00:16:12.797]  And the Quantcast numbers, which is a highly reputable website tracking group, show that sites like InfoWars, okay, which represent the overall, like, just hatred of the mainstream media by people, are already as big as the BBC.com and bigger than CNBC and stuff like that.
[00:16:13.697 --> 00:16:32.723]  So, once again, even if you don't agree with all of it, it's not that I agree with every single thing that I ultimately give support to, it's because I see, wow, that's actually doing something, making a difference, standing against a bunch of the BS and doing something purposeful and meaningful, while so many media outlets out there don't even care at all, to the zero degree.
[00:16:33.063 --> 00:16:38.964]  In fact, it's not that they don't even care, it's that they have instead decided to 100% print junk.
[00:16:41.425 --> 00:16:46.611]  Thanks to special interests and obviously the individuals paying their salary, right?
[00:16:46.911 --> 00:16:52.958]  Let's get into some of that news and maybe we can print that new WikiLeaks information so we can talk about it now instead of having to wait also.
[00:16:52.998 --> 00:16:55.640]  But yes, Biggs will come in and talk about it as well.
[00:16:56.501 --> 00:16:57.282]  So let's get into this.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.001]  Election news.
[00:16:59.021 --> 00:16:59.921]  We've got a lot of election news.
[00:16:59.941 --> 00:17:01.682]  We've got a lot of tons of news, right?
[00:17:01.823 --> 00:17:12.310]  And remember, it's times like these that new stuff comes out that's really important and no one talks about it because we're so busy talking about the elections or whatever it is that happens.
[00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:20.115]  And you'll notice stuff always slips through the cracks around these times because people are in such a frenzy and they're only like, well, I only want to talk about the elections.
[00:17:20.536 --> 00:17:21.316]  Understandably.
[00:17:21.736 --> 00:17:24.378]  But like most news sources are going to be like, oh, elections only.
[00:17:24.418 --> 00:17:25.619]  We need to focus on the elections 100%.
[00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:25.859]  And then
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.421]  All the other stuff that's actually important just kind of goes away, right?
[00:17:30.541 --> 00:17:32.802]  All the other stuff just kind of sprinkles away somehow.
[00:17:33.743 --> 00:17:39.545]  FBI questioned American Muslims in eight states over weekend about possible pre-election terrorism, says civil rights group.
[00:17:40.285 --> 00:17:50.189]  Civil rights organization for American Muslims says the FBI questioned Muslims in at least eight states over the weekend seeking information about a possible threat from Al-Qaeda to carry out pre-election terrorist attacks.
[00:17:50.689 --> 00:17:59.771]  Individuals were asked eight questions, including several specific to Al-Qaeda, said Hassan Shibley, a lawyer and the executive director of Council American Islamic Relations.
[00:18:00.131 --> 00:18:03.172]  He said his clients were asked whether they know the Al-Qaeda leaders killed in the U.S.
[00:18:03.212 --> 00:18:04.912]  military airstrikes last month, who U.S.
[00:18:04.952 --> 00:18:10.814]  officials believe were connected to the alleged plot, and whether they knew of anyone who wished to harm Americans at home or abroad.
[00:18:12.916 --> 00:18:17.760]  Talk about Al-Qaeda or ISIS launching operations in the United States.
[00:18:18.361 --> 00:18:21.483]  And the concerning thing is, you know, who knows the validity of that?
[00:18:21.764 --> 00:18:23.966]  Who knows what the full deal was with the FBI asking?
[00:18:24.786 --> 00:18:34.254]  But the concerning thing is the disparity between the media reporting things and actually knowing things that are going on.
[00:18:34.314 --> 00:18:35.455]  And I'll give you an example of that.
[00:18:35.836 --> 00:18:39.059]  I know individuals that have been targeted by ISIS.
[00:18:40.151 --> 00:18:48.013]  They're on lists that people in the United States with FBI, just police reporting it up the chain, you name it.
[00:18:48.453 --> 00:18:58.976]  They're on lists, on these like kill lists, okay, where ISIS has these massive lists where they're basically setting up names of people they really want to die because they're such horrible infidels, right?
[00:18:59.496 --> 00:19:03.057]  And of individuals that are on this list, and they get tips
[00:19:03.357 --> 00:19:13.127]  From the police and from the FBI, and they say, yeah, we found information about it in major cities that are nearby, and yes, they are actually in the United States, so you better watch out.
[00:19:13.708 --> 00:19:16.251]  And then they would go back and say, well, what are you talking about?
[00:19:16.992 --> 00:19:18.313]  ISIS is in the United States?
[00:19:18.353 --> 00:19:18.773]  What do you mean?
[00:19:18.994 --> 00:19:25.200]  Oh, we didn't say that, but we found information in a major city right nearby you, in Texas,
[00:19:26.201 --> 00:19:29.663]  And we had some operatives there that we got a list from.
[00:19:29.683 --> 00:19:36.846]  They're like, wait a minute, so you are saying that ISIS is in a major city in the United States with potential targeting of people in the United States.
[00:19:38.146 --> 00:19:42.568]  Okay, so let me just tell you, it is totally absurd.
[00:19:42.668 --> 00:19:45.850]  And it's not meant to just create fear, right?
[00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:47.591]  It's not meant to just say, well, ISIS is everywhere.
[00:19:47.631 --> 00:19:49.932]  We do have to surrender all of our civil liberties.
[00:19:49.972 --> 00:19:54.454]  We have to walk through the TSA and give up everything because ISIS could be getting us.
[00:19:55.074 --> 00:20:01.316]  But no, the absurdity is, they do all of that and TSA doesn't catch any terrorists, and instead they just grope you.
[00:20:01.716 --> 00:20:08.198]  And every single time I go through the airport, it's like a nightmare experience if you want to opt out of the naked body scanners.
[00:20:08.779 --> 00:20:14.160]  And then they want to grope you again, and even if you go through the naked body scanners, they want to, like, grope you over and over and over again.
[00:20:14.501 --> 00:20:16.621]  They want you to take your watch off for no reason.
[00:20:16.881 --> 00:20:18.002]  They just want to bully you.
[00:20:18.042 --> 00:20:19.242]  That's not going to stop terrorism.
[00:20:19.522 --> 00:20:21.623]  But then, when there's actual threats,
[00:20:22.023 --> 00:20:31.953]  When there is ISIS inside the United States, and they're actually having lists of people to kill that are individuals or public figures or whatever, then that's fine, that's not a big deal.
[00:20:32.373 --> 00:20:37.498]  The real thing is the TSA pre-screening where they grope you and grope genitals doesn't do anything.
[00:20:38.819 --> 00:20:40.201]  But, you know what's worse than that?
[00:20:40.861 --> 00:20:43.784]  This is another one of those stories that, you know, would never be covered today.
[00:20:44.724 --> 00:20:46.486]  But it's just such a big story.
[00:20:46.526 --> 00:20:54.293]  This is one of those stories that really, really needs to highlight the level of ridiculousness that we've reached.
[00:20:54.813 --> 00:21:02.681]  And it needs to highlight also the idea that if we give credit to the system that screwed us over,
[00:21:03.817 --> 00:21:10.722]  You notice that they're always saying officials like Department of blah blah blah officials officials.
[00:21:10.862 --> 00:21:12.963]  They're so official like they're your ruler.
[00:21:12.983 --> 00:21:14.164]  Okay, the officials.
[00:21:14.204 --> 00:21:14.864]  They're so good.
[00:21:15.165 --> 00:21:16.646]  We need to trust in our officials.
[00:21:17.066 --> 00:21:33.637]  Well, this is what blind faith in our officials gets us funding our officials with just the worst system out there undercover sting nabs, California mother selling ceviche through Facebook group, which is like a raw fish dip.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.609]  It's a Mexican traditional food.
[00:21:39.113 --> 00:21:47.076]  Marisa Rueles never expected a plate of ceviche would lead her into the courthouse and maybe even a possible jail sentence.
[00:21:49.477 --> 00:21:50.818]  Selling ceviche, jail sentence.
[00:21:51.258 --> 00:21:52.599]  This is from the Washington Post.
[00:21:52.939 --> 00:22:06.144]  For more than a year, undercover investigators in San Joaquin County, California tracked the sales of food such as homemade tamales, tortillas, and cakes through a community Facebook group.
[00:22:07.805 --> 00:22:09.506]  The crime that's being committed!
[00:22:09.526 --> 00:22:10.827]  A sting?
[00:22:10.847 --> 00:22:12.068]  A sting!
[00:22:13.048 --> 00:22:17.011]  That Maria Reles called a waste of time and resources and taxpayers' money.
[00:22:17.031 --> 00:22:17.431]  You think?
[00:22:17.812 --> 00:22:18.052]  Okay.
[00:22:18.712 --> 00:22:19.252]  It goes on.
[00:22:19.273 --> 00:22:31.120]  Reles, a single mother of six, first came across the Facebook group about two years ago when she needed a last-minute cake for her daughter's quinceañera, a Hispanic coming-of-age celebration on a young woman's 15th birthday.
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.221]  Maybe we could, uh...
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.502]  Let's pull this up as well.
[00:22:35.642 --> 00:22:37.223]  We'll go to break in a minute if that's alright.
[00:22:37.243 --> 00:22:38.244]  We're just going to finish up here.
[00:22:39.045 --> 00:22:42.688]  And maybe we can pull this up also, the undercover stink, because people don't believe this stuff.
[00:22:43.569 --> 00:22:43.789]  Okay.
[00:22:44.449 --> 00:22:54.558]  The community forum on Facebook, 209 Food Spot, allowed Stockton, California residents to share recipes, organize potlucks, and occasionally sell or exchange food items.
[00:22:54.678 --> 00:22:55.058]  Oh my.
[00:22:55.859 --> 00:22:57.480]  What criminal operation!
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.201]  Here's the best part.
[00:22:59.087 --> 00:23:01.630]  Okay, they were tracking this for years.
[00:23:02.551 --> 00:23:13.162]  Says for more than a year, undercover investigators were tracking these mothers selling tortillas and cakes and stuff on a Facebook group.
[00:23:13.851 --> 00:23:14.071]  Okay.
[00:23:14.951 --> 00:23:18.472]  As a hobby, about once a month, the woman, she began offering up her own dishes.
[00:23:18.512 --> 00:23:20.972]  A tray of rice and beans in exchange for a birthday cake.
[00:23:21.212 --> 00:23:25.673]  Her staple, chicken-stuffed avocados to those who requested it, she said in a phone interview with the Post.
[00:23:26.093 --> 00:23:28.674]  Then, in July, she received a letter in the mail.
[00:23:29.014 --> 00:23:30.594]  She was being summoned to court.
[00:23:31.134 --> 00:23:35.455]  Ruelles, along with several other group members, faced citations for two misdemeanors.
[00:23:35.735 --> 00:23:39.176]  Operating a food facility and engaging in business without a permit.
[00:23:39.963 --> 00:23:46.065]  An undercover investigator had ordered a ceviche from her through Facebook group in October 2015 as a part of a sting.
[00:23:46.085 --> 00:23:51.687]  She accepted and half a dozen others accepted a plea deal of one year probation, a $235 fine and 40 hours of community service.
[00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:02.812]  Ceviche for selling a chip dip on Facebook.
[00:24:03.353 --> 00:24:04.793]  How dare she?
[00:24:05.614 --> 00:24:06.434]  How dare she?
[00:24:06.754 --> 00:24:07.655]  What a criminal!
[00:24:07.675 --> 00:24:18.801]  Okay, this is what happens when we give credit to a system and, oh, the holy officials, the police spent over a year running sting operations to stop her from selling ceviche and rice.
[00:24:20.831 --> 00:24:22.532]  Talk about a diversion of funds.
[00:24:22.552 --> 00:24:38.138]  All right, now I know we got to go to break and I pushed it back, but I also want to remind you before we do go to break, on Infowarsstore.com, part of the 52-hour broadcast and super sale fundraiser, because really it's a fundraiser to try and take things to the next level because you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.
[00:24:39.326 --> 00:24:50.732]  All I know is, as I've said many times, and it is the truth that is 100% taken from my deepest value, is support something with purpose.
[00:24:51.052 --> 00:24:53.733]  Support something that is actually making a difference.
[00:24:54.174 --> 00:24:55.895]  And get 30% off Supermail.

[00:25:01.417 --> 00:25:02.458]  Infowarslife.com.

[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:05.900]  We'll be right back.
[00:25:20.851 --> 00:25:26.533]  I want to see 10 million viewers tune in over the 50-plus hours, and that's where you come in.
[00:25:26.994 --> 00:25:28.714]  You are the heart and blood of the InfoWars.
[00:25:29.034 --> 00:25:40.299]  If you spread the link to InfoWars.com forward slash show and point out that this is the alternative new media, this is the rebellion, then all of you are riding right beside us, not behind us.
[00:25:40.679 --> 00:25:46.241]  So spread the word by Paul Reveres, no matter where you live in the world, to Information Warfare Arms.
[00:25:46.562 --> 00:25:49.623]  The globalists are coming, and they will be met on the field.
[00:26:04.085 --> 00:26:12.011]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[00:26:12.051 --> 00:26:14.012]  Now, this is our 20th product.
[00:26:14.773 --> 00:26:21.678]  We could easily go out to a major vitamin or supplement company and private label a thousand different products.
[00:26:22.278 --> 00:26:28.063]  But it's taken us four plus years to even come out with 20 because we private label some, but we also develop
[00:26:28.954 --> 00:26:36.080]  Many of the products originally were some of the top labs in the country, so that they're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[00:26:36.889 --> 00:26:38.709]  And they're also very affordable.
[00:26:38.729 --> 00:26:39.069]  Exactly.
[00:26:39.089 --> 00:26:40.870]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:44.231]  You talk about... We're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[00:26:44.271 --> 00:26:45.551]  We've both talked to them.
[00:26:45.851 --> 00:26:51.752]  They have conveyor belts of herbs falling on the ground and they have someone come and sweep them up and put them back on the conveyor belt.
[00:26:52.092 --> 00:27:01.054]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[00:27:01.935 --> 00:27:03.036]  We refuse to screw people.
[00:27:03.397 --> 00:27:04.358]  We refuse to do that.
[00:27:04.739 --> 00:27:06.762]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[00:27:07.142 --> 00:27:09.405]  We're producing something we want to take.
[00:27:09.505 --> 00:27:09.966]  Exactly.
[00:27:10.066 --> 00:27:11.348]  We're looking for the best.
[00:27:11.408 --> 00:27:16.275]  We went out and searched for the best to private label and most of the time found out it wasn't available.
[00:27:16.495 --> 00:27:17.417]  So we go to these big firms.
[00:27:31.596 --> 00:27:33.497]  It must be followed.
[00:27:34.017 --> 00:27:41.699]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:27:41.939 --> 00:27:43.960]  As president, I will make it clear.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.342]  Let's talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[00:27:50.362 --> 00:27:52.343]  Now, this is our 20th product.
[00:27:53.103 --> 00:27:57.985]  We can easily go out to a major vitamin or supplement company and private label a thousand
[00:27:59.215 --> 00:27:59.635]  We're good to go.
[00:28:15.216 --> 00:28:17.056]  And they're also very affordable.
[00:28:17.076 --> 00:28:17.396]  Exactly.
[00:28:17.416 --> 00:28:19.197]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[00:28:19.217 --> 00:28:22.558]  You talk about... We're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[00:28:22.598 --> 00:28:23.878]  We've both talked to them.
[00:28:24.178 --> 00:28:30.079]  They have conveyor belts of herbs falling on the ground and they have someone come and sweep them up and put them back on the conveyor belt.
[00:28:30.419 --> 00:28:39.381]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[00:28:40.262 --> 00:28:41.363]  We refuse to screw people.
[00:28:41.723 --> 00:28:42.684]  We refuse to do that.
[00:28:43.065 --> 00:28:45.107]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[00:28:45.468 --> 00:28:47.750]  We're producing something we want to take.
[00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:48.291]  Exactly.
[00:28:48.391 --> 00:28:49.693]  We're looking for the best.
[00:28:49.733 --> 00:28:54.598]  We went out and searched for the best to private label and most of the time found out it wasn't available.
[00:28:54.819 --> 00:28:58.623]  So we go to these big firms and say we want to make the dream formula.
[00:28:58.643 --> 00:29:02.426]  Yes, and in this case, with Bio PCA, there's nothing out there that is what we wanted.
[00:29:02.686 --> 00:29:03.527]  So we made our own.
[00:29:03.627 --> 00:29:06.149]  We went with chemists and scientists and we actually created this formula.
[00:29:06.589 --> 00:29:09.831]  And it's a proprietary blend, as in, you're not going to get this anywhere else.
[00:29:10.192 --> 00:29:16.196]  Bio PCA, for example, one of the ingredients is silica, and it's from bamboo extract.
[00:29:16.997 --> 00:29:17.717]  It's everywhere.
[00:29:17.877 --> 00:29:18.538]  It's in nature.
[00:29:18.598 --> 00:29:20.579]  It's an essential part of being healthy, right?
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:27.104]  Just this bottle of silica, okay, again, one ingredient, in a lower amount than even in our product, is $35.
[00:29:28.345 --> 00:29:33.589]  They're charging more than what we charge, when they have one ingredient that's less than ours.
[00:29:33.629 --> 00:29:34.289]  This is insane.
[00:29:34.309 --> 00:29:44.316]  When I told him we wanted 10,000 micrograms, he goes, OK, I get that you guys want to do, you know, high-powered stuff, but why don't you just do 3,000, and then you can sell, you know, multiple bottles of it, people will buy more of it.
[00:29:44.336 --> 00:29:45.077]  I was like, no, let's do 10.
[00:29:45.197 --> 00:29:46.978]  OK, compare that to this.
[00:29:47.198 --> 00:29:49.920]  This is a $50 product, one of the leaders in the industry.
[00:29:50.221 --> 00:29:51.882]  It has 3,000 micrograms of biotin.
[00:29:51.902 --> 00:29:52.102]  OK, we have 10,000.
[00:29:52.262 --> 00:29:52.782]  This is $50, $48 to be exact.
[00:29:56.585 --> 00:30:01.667]  Obviously, if it's making the hair, the skin, the nails healthier, what is it doing in the body?
[00:30:01.887 --> 00:30:02.827]  It's systematic, right?
[00:30:02.968 --> 00:30:08.149]  So obviously, if your skin and your hairs and your nails are looking better, then you're at the root level changing things.
[00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.170]  I want products I'm going to use for my family.
[00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:10.951]  I take this.
[00:30:11.371 --> 00:30:12.411]  My family takes this.
[00:30:12.951 --> 00:30:17.793]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find anywhere.
[00:30:17.853 --> 00:30:19.294]  So what you find in our information
[00:30:20.123 --> 00:30:23.927]  In our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.

[00:30:32.095 --> 00:30:34.718]  There's no script, no teleprompter, I'll be honest with you.
[00:30:35.118 --> 00:30:37.481]  My problem is with 20 products now...
[00:30:38.962 --> 00:30:40.383]  It's remembering to take them all.
[00:30:40.983 --> 00:30:44.226]  Because when I do, I have great days, great weeks, a great life.
[00:30:44.646 --> 00:30:53.372]  When I forget to take the X2, a super male, or the lung cleanse, or to do a liver cleanse, or to take this product, my quality of life just isn't as good.
[00:30:53.432 --> 00:30:54.533]  It's changed my life.
[00:30:54.633 --> 00:30:56.874]  I looked like Jabba the Hutt four years ago.
[00:30:57.214 --> 00:30:59.096]  I was swimming two miles some days a day.
[00:30:59.476 --> 00:31:00.937]  I was jogging, lifting weights.
[00:31:00.977 --> 00:31:01.818]  I couldn't lose the weight.
[00:31:02.742 --> 00:31:09.814]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[00:31:10.215 --> 00:31:10.976]  It's a win-win.
[00:31:11.457 --> 00:31:12.238]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:22.199 --> 00:31:27.883]  I want to see 10 million viewers tune in over the 50-plus hours, and that's where you come in.
[00:31:28.344 --> 00:31:30.065]  You are the heart and blood of the InfoWars.
[00:31:30.385 --> 00:31:41.653]  If you spread the link to InfoWars.com forward slash show and point out that this is the alternative new media, this is the rebellion, then all of you are riding right beside us, not behind us.
[00:31:42.013 --> 00:31:47.577]  So spread the word, my Paul Reveres, no matter where you live in the world, to Information Warfare Arms.
[00:31:47.918 --> 00:31:50.980]  The globalists are coming, and they will be met on the field.
[00:32:01.886 --> 00:32:03.508]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us.
[00:32:03.528 --> 00:32:06.691]  Alright, I guess we're back then.
[00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:15.700]  So we are back, and I'll tell you what, we're covering the criminal, scary, nefarious acts of ceviche-selling mothers on Facebook.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:16.961]  Before we went to break.
[00:32:17.222 --> 00:32:18.483]  Talking about this article.
[00:32:18.883 --> 00:32:22.587]  Undercover sting nabs California mother selling ceviche through Facebook group.
[00:32:22.647 --> 00:32:24.769]  It's just about the ridiculousness of
[00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:27.690]  But anyway, we're going to talk about some other stuff and some health news.
[00:32:50.825 --> 00:33:10.764]  My good friend, and truly one of the most knowledgeable people I've ever met in my entire life, who all the stuff you said 20 years ago, everything you said, I mean, with the gut health linking to pretty much every single condition there is, and all the stuff you talked about, it blows my mind reading about it in the news now.
[00:33:11.445 --> 00:33:12.485]  It freaks me out, you know?
[00:33:12.846 --> 00:33:13.286]  It really does.
[00:33:14.147 --> 00:33:25.516]  The level of ridiculousness that we have reached is so crazy, but at the same time, the level of information that people are being just open to and understanding and absorbing, you know?
[00:33:25.776 --> 00:33:27.037]  It's an amazing thing.
[00:33:27.397 --> 00:33:29.399]  Yeah, the Internet had a lot to do with that.
[00:33:29.459 --> 00:33:40.307]  I mean, when we looked at the root cause of all disease and really came to the conclusion of simplicity, it's not something that I invented or we invented.
[00:33:40.588 --> 00:33:41.308]  It's history!
[00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:44.716]  Truth stands the test of time.
[00:33:44.736 --> 00:33:49.342]  You look at the ancient Egyptians, the ancient Indian cultures, traditional Chinese medicine.
[00:33:49.362 --> 00:34:02.397]  I mean, what we're going through right now as a society, and I get phone calls every single day, I honestly think that it's the most turmoil as far as stress is concerned with people regarding this election.
[00:34:03.743 --> 00:34:12.990]  Everything leading up to it, you have 50% of the people are in fear and anxiety that Trump will win, 50% of the people are in fear and anxiety that Clinton will win.
[00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:19.795]  My message is always about positivity and keeping yourself healthy and keeping yourself relaxed.
[00:34:19.935 --> 00:34:21.677]  It's hard, even myself.
[00:34:23.838 --> 00:34:33.808]  All the stuff that's going on, even talking to Alex earlier about what's going on with this new flu vaccine that's coming out and how it's targeted.
[00:34:33.828 --> 00:34:36.091]  Well look, I'm here to tell you actually, look, you're wrong, okay?
[00:34:37.132 --> 00:34:37.812]  Huffington Post.
[00:34:38.717 --> 00:34:40.339]  Don't worry about fixing stuff.
[00:34:41.019 --> 00:34:44.903]  Don't worry about talking about what needs to be done and changing the system.
[00:34:45.824 --> 00:34:50.368]  Strangely relaxing Instagram accounts are the perfect remedy for your election anxieties.
[00:34:50.388 --> 00:34:50.888]  Okay?
[00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:52.430]  This is the answer.
[00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:55.292]  33 minutes ago when I printed this, breaking, okay?
[00:34:56.093 --> 00:34:57.913]  Strangely relaxing Instagram accounts.
[00:34:58.393 --> 00:35:06.715]  We're officially in the final phase of what has been the most hellish election in recent American history, with less than 48 hours until a new president of the United States is hopefully officially declared.
[00:35:07.135 --> 00:35:08.616]  Are you feeling pretty chill?
[00:35:09.336 --> 00:35:15.457]  For many of us out there suffering the very real election stress disorder, which we're going to talk about, the answer will be a resounding no.
[00:35:16.337 --> 00:35:22.658]  Well, many have suggested ways to mitigate the acute terror and unease that have resulted from worrying about the future of the nation.
[00:35:22.738 --> 00:35:24.739]  Well, Huffington Post has it.
[00:35:25.359 --> 00:35:25.499]  It's
[00:35:26.818 --> 00:35:40.881]  Instagram accounts of food photos and plants so you just all you have to do don't worry about the future of the country okay don't worry about anything just look at the Instagram accounts of plants and flowers and
[00:35:41.403 --> 00:35:42.483]  It's actually a real article.
[00:35:43.464 --> 00:35:45.444]  I'm joking around, obviously, but it is a real article.
[00:35:46.184 --> 00:35:47.965]  Just look at the plants and stuff and everything's fine.
[00:35:48.205 --> 00:35:49.585]  So you don't have to be upset.
[00:35:50.045 --> 00:35:54.547]  So I think you're actually going against the advice of Huffington Post.
[00:35:54.567 --> 00:35:56.767]  Here's one, too, with this little flower thing.
[00:35:57.307 --> 00:35:58.088]  So don't worry about any of that.
[00:35:58.128 --> 00:36:09.371]  I've been going against the Huffington Post and the mainstream media for years and the medical profession and the FDA and everything else just because, you know, it's not hard.
[00:36:11.434 --> 00:36:23.443]  I just can't understand how people don't take the time and the research and do the research, for example, before they give their child a vaccination or a flu shot or before they feed somebody genetically modified foods.
[00:36:23.503 --> 00:36:27.366]  And now, I mean, the good thing is that times are changing.
[00:36:27.407 --> 00:36:30.129]  What worries me is, look, the whole focus of health
[00:36:31.263 --> 00:36:39.506]  That we figured out and that we researched on was that all disease starts in the gut and all health begins in the gut.
[00:36:39.966 --> 00:36:49.490]  And during these times, we've seen an exponential increase in gut problems and gut disease over the last couple years, especially right now when people are so stressed out.
[00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:56.574]  When you're stressed and you're in a chronic state of anxiety, number one, you're not getting enough sleep, which heals the body.
[00:36:56.995 --> 00:37:01.437]  Number two, your bowel is in a parasympathetic state.
[00:37:01.477 --> 00:37:09.703]  It's the parasympathetic, which is your relaxation, when you meditate, when you're calm, when you're happy, then you can go to the bathroom.
[00:37:09.783 --> 00:37:19.710]  When you're in a sympathetic state, when you're under extreme stress, anxiety, which we know now that the nation is under, and not only the nation, but pretty much the world,
[00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:25.432]  It actually causes your digestive system to contract and not even move.
[00:37:25.512 --> 00:37:36.037]  So we have constipation, people are overeating, we're coming into the holiday season right now, all of the new flu shots coming into play.
[00:37:36.917 --> 00:37:43.483]  You know, this is a time where people really need to take a close look at their health and say, I need to relax a little bit.
[00:37:43.643 --> 00:37:44.884]  I need to eat healthy.
[00:37:45.484 --> 00:37:56.994]  My projections are that we're going to see more sick people and more deaths this year than ever before, because everybody's going into this holiday season stressed out.
[00:37:57.895 --> 00:37:59.016]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:37:59.056 --> 00:38:01.278]  I mean, that time will tell tomorrow, but
[00:38:02.657 --> 00:38:13.825]  Depending on whatever happens, you know, we're here to give the people the information that they need to create change in their lives and that's our whole mission and that's, you know, exponentially becoming the mission.
[00:38:13.845 --> 00:38:18.308]  With all of these leaks coming out, it's already started now.
[00:38:18.468 --> 00:38:20.089]  I mean, the truth is coming out.
[00:38:20.109 --> 00:38:24.031]  Now you have the insiders at the NSA, the FBI,
[00:38:25.092 --> 00:38:42.284]  All coming forward that have been, you know, had their mouths tied together for years and years and years because it just takes one person and then the next person feels a little bit safer coming out and the next person feels a little bit safer and a little bit safer and a little bit safer and finally the American people will understand
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:39:00.307]  Not the conspiracy, but the truth of what's been happening ever since we reported on how fluoride was purposely put in the water systems, and how the genetically modified foods, and Monsanto, and all of these things that we've been reporting on, and we've been giving people solutions for that too.
[00:39:00.887 --> 00:39:07.930]  All the people with thyroid disorders now, all the people that are vitamin D deficient, we've been coming up with an iodine deficient.
[00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:32.018]  We've been coming up with these solutions year after year after year to protect and educate the people so they can continue doing what they need to do, continue becoming healthy, continue blocking all of these bullets that are being fired at them from everywhere on a regular basis and teaching people how to repair the gut and keep their immune system strong.
[00:39:32.438 --> 00:39:35.780]  I think the issue is that people walk around in self-made prisons, right?
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:40.142]  And I think it doesn't even matter to the depths of which you want to go to it, right?
[00:39:40.422 --> 00:39:45.585]  It doesn't even have to go to the level of even as far as we're going right now.
[00:39:45.785 --> 00:39:48.987]  It just has to go to the very simple idea that people
[00:39:49.967 --> 00:39:54.429]  Fortunately, unfortunately, project the way that they think they are on everyone else.
[00:39:54.489 --> 00:39:56.830]  So, for example, they think that, well, most people are good.
[00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:58.571]  They wouldn't do anything bad.
[00:39:59.051 --> 00:40:05.374]  They have this idea that most people in power want the good, you know, the best for people, which is a really sweet concept, right?
[00:40:05.414 --> 00:40:15.879]  It's really beautiful, except it gets rid of the very true reality that there's a lot of sociopathic and psychopathic people out there that'll do anything they can to climb to the top, and they actually have an advantage.
[00:40:15.939 --> 00:40:17.940]  It's been shown in studies over and over and over again.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:22.022]  A lot of CEOs exhibit sociopathic or psychopathic behavior.
[00:40:22.442 --> 00:40:27.085]  A lot of top politicians clearly exhibit sociopathic or psychopathic behavior.
[00:40:27.665 --> 00:40:30.787]  And it makes sense because they're willing to do things other people aren't.
[00:40:30.807 --> 00:40:36.930]  I mean, how many times in your life have you been, you know, attacked by someone or whatever and you say, God, how could they do that?
[00:40:37.471 --> 00:40:41.273]  And then you think, oh, well, it's because I'm thinking about, you know,
[00:40:41.633 --> 00:40:48.708]  Myself I'm not thinking about what other people are willing to do and I'm just gonna give people a reality check I mean not only
[00:40:49.841 --> 00:40:52.202]  I mean, you can just go walk five minutes down the street.
[00:40:52.242 --> 00:40:53.723]  Go into the woods.
[00:40:54.363 --> 00:40:56.904]  You're going to see animals ripping each other's flesh out.
[00:40:57.244 --> 00:40:59.845]  You're going to see animals slicing each other.
[00:40:59.865 --> 00:41:01.046]  You're going to see blood squirting.
[00:41:01.726 --> 00:41:04.067]  You're going to see insects killing each other.
[00:41:04.727 --> 00:41:09.329]  The world is not a happy bonanza with fairies and unicorns everywhere.
[00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:11.010]  Does that mean everything's screwed?
[00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:14.452]  Does that mean, oh, there's nothing we can do, we're all going to die, why care anyway?
[00:41:14.552 --> 00:41:15.072]  Absolutely not.
[00:41:15.552 --> 00:41:19.753]  But it means we have to balance the reality of how things are to see the full picture.
[00:41:19.933 --> 00:41:21.774]  And that can produce actual results, right?
[00:41:21.874 --> 00:41:24.794]  So, without the perspective, we can't even have solutions.
[00:41:25.134 --> 00:41:31.536]  So, for example, okay, some of these stories, when I read things like this, it's not to just talk about how bad things are, okay?
[00:41:31.996 --> 00:41:38.018]  True positivity, in my view, and true results and solutions, like you were saying, is actually getting understanding the picture.
[00:41:38.098 --> 00:41:42.699]  Like, it's not Plato's cave, it's not being in the cave, never going outside.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:50.565]  No, look, every time that we had, when we used to see patients and we had patients coming into our office and these patients were...
[00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:54.791]  Had been seen by the top doctors in the world, usually 10 or 15.
[00:41:55.931 --> 00:42:03.854]  Our reputation, when we had our clinic before we got shut down, was that if we can't figure out what's wrong with you, we'll send them to Dr. Groot.
[00:42:03.914 --> 00:42:11.256]  So all the people that I saw, for the most part, that had cancer or whatever disease they had, had already been to the top doctors in the world.
[00:42:11.296 --> 00:42:15.618]  And they came in with bags full of prescription medications, bags full of supplements.
[00:42:16.358 --> 00:42:18.600]  And I would sit him down and ask him one thing.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:22.723]  The first thing I would ask him is, can you tell me why you have cancer?
[00:42:23.383 --> 00:42:25.645]  Can you tell me why you have diabetes?
[00:42:25.685 --> 00:42:30.228]  Can you tell me why you have these symptoms or this condition that you have?
[00:42:30.348 --> 00:42:32.470]  And not one, they all, they were surprised.
[00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:34.191]  They said, no one's ever asked me that before.
[00:42:35.324 --> 00:42:39.508]  I've been to the top doctors in the world and none of them asked me that question before.
[00:42:40.409 --> 00:42:55.102]  And so it's about teaching the... So next I would say, well let me explain to you, and this goes to your point that you just talked about as far as, it's not that we're sitting here reporting all this negative news all the time, but it's about understanding the solution.
[00:42:55.322 --> 00:42:55.502]  Yeah.
[00:42:55.542 --> 00:42:58.324]  Understanding the solutions to the problems that we face.
[00:42:58.864 --> 00:43:08.771]  And right now, the InfoWars listeners, I wish everybody watched InfoWars, because I know how strict Alex is, and you guys are, and all the reporters are, about reporting the truth.
[00:43:08.811 --> 00:43:10.512]  I mean, you have to have evidence.
[00:43:11.032 --> 00:43:15.996]  Twenty-something years, no news agency or outside agency has been able to discredit
[00:43:17.537 --> 00:43:22.020]  Well, I mean, look, let's be honest, okay?
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:27.124]  Everyone's wrong sometimes, and everything's not 100% accurate in every single possible way from any organization, right?
[00:43:27.465 --> 00:43:32.469]  That's totally the case, and no one agrees with everything that every single person says in the whole entire world, right?
[00:43:33.009 --> 00:43:36.172]  But the point is that at least we're sitting here trying.
[00:43:36.832 --> 00:43:36.992]  Right?
[00:43:37.092 --> 00:43:38.913]  At least we're sitting here talking about this stuff.
[00:43:39.194 --> 00:43:46.559]  At least we are expanding our minds enough to question the very constraints that have been put on us that we're not allowed to question anything.
[00:43:46.959 --> 00:43:47.159]  Right?
[00:43:47.419 --> 00:44:06.612]  And when I talk about jarring people out of their state, like their kind of comfort state where they don't want to talk about anything, I talk about these headlines that we're about to read, and I say that because it's necessary to slap people in the face consciously and ideologically to get them out of that little self-made prison where they can start seeing other stuff.
[00:44:07.012 --> 00:44:07.192]  Right?
[00:44:07.572 --> 00:44:14.996]  And it doesn't mean you have to go so far down the rabbit hole we're not being run by massive reptoid alien creatures that suck our brains when we go to sleep or whatever, right?
[00:44:15.396 --> 00:44:16.556]  But just a little bit!
[00:44:16.636 --> 00:44:18.317]  Just question a little bit of stuff.
[00:44:18.858 --> 00:44:23.159]  The weirdness of the world is such that it's insurmountably insane.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:29.723]  15-year-old girl can have sexual relationship with 47-year-old uncle, German court rules.
[00:44:29.743 --> 00:44:30.983]  Okay, this is just a little taste.
[00:44:31.324 --> 00:44:32.204]  This is what I talked about earlier.
[00:44:32.224 --> 00:44:35.786]  A liberal mother of six jailed for challenging Saudi taboos.
[00:44:36.606 --> 00:44:46.031]  She posted tweets about beards worn by Saudi clerics and talked about how beards don't make you instantly, you know, a great type of man or something.
[00:44:46.051 --> 00:44:46.752]  Oh, you're gonna go to jail.
[00:44:47.492 --> 00:44:49.673]  New leak may show if you were hacked by the NSA.
[00:44:49.733 --> 00:44:53.075]  It's gotten to the point now where we need to go and verify.
[00:44:53.156 --> 00:44:54.276]  Is the NSA hacking me?
[00:44:54.356 --> 00:44:56.397]  You know, like, we have to go verify.
[00:44:56.618 --> 00:44:58.259]  They're just, they're just hacking everybody.
[00:44:58.299 --> 00:45:03.942]  I mean, I think it's pretty much a well-known fact now that you're gonna be watched over.
[00:45:04.022 --> 00:45:05.863]  I mean... It is, 100%.
[00:45:05.943 --> 00:45:07.764]  You have no privacy left anymore.
[00:45:07.804 --> 00:45:17.030]  And then, and then people, and this is, this, this headline was specifically chosen to challenge the people that think that everyone's good and everything's happy and everyone's beautiful and that the world leaders, they're officials.
[00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:18.570]  Remember that term, the officials.
[00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.470]  I love that.
[00:45:20.031 --> 00:45:25.091]  The police officials, the state department officials, government officials, right?
[00:45:25.232 --> 00:45:26.012]  What does that even mean?
[00:45:26.192 --> 00:45:26.812]  An official?
[00:45:27.132 --> 00:45:27.692]  It means nothing.
[00:45:27.732 --> 00:45:29.892]  It means they're good at doing officially nothing.
[00:45:30.012 --> 00:45:35.533]  It means that it's good propaganda to make you believe that they have a higher authority than you.
[00:45:36.054 --> 00:45:36.834]  But guess what?
[00:45:37.494 --> 00:45:40.714]  Psychopaths and sociopaths love to climb and use those ranks.
[00:45:41.255 --> 00:45:42.875]  And this is from Africa.
[00:45:43.863 --> 00:45:50.449]  Boko Haram survivors sexually abused at safe camps set up by government officials to protect them from rape.
[00:45:51.049 --> 00:45:51.310]  Okay?
[00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:52.811]  This is sad stuff.
[00:45:52.891 --> 00:45:53.652]  This is from CNN.
[00:45:53.972 --> 00:46:02.820]  Women and girls who survived Boko Haram violence were raped by government officials at camps in northern Nigeria where they sought safety, according to a news rights group report.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:14.992]  Dozens of victims who stayed at camps for the displaced in Brno State's capital told Human Rights Watch they were sexually abused or coerced into sex by camp leaders, vigilante group members, policemen and soldiers.
[00:46:15.412 --> 00:46:18.135]  Many of the women were abandoned after becoming pregnant.
[00:46:18.775 --> 00:46:18.995]  Okay.
[00:46:19.436 --> 00:46:25.359]  It is bad enough that these women and girls are not getting much needed support for horrific trauma they suffered at the hands of Boko Haram.
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:30.403]  It's disgraceful and outrageous that people who should protect these women and girls are attacking and abusing them.
[00:46:30.803 --> 00:46:32.224]  So why would we talk about that?
[00:46:32.244 --> 00:46:33.585]  That's sick.
[00:46:33.645 --> 00:46:34.705]  It's sick and disgusting.
[00:46:34.765 --> 00:46:37.567]  I tell you what though, I have to say, I do have to say, there has been
[00:46:41.644 --> 00:46:49.252]  More and more officials, you know, you use the term officials, that are coming over to the good side.
[00:46:49.332 --> 00:46:51.254]  I mean, I talk to police officers.
[00:46:51.414 --> 00:46:53.136]  Hey, I think most people are good.
[00:46:53.176 --> 00:46:54.357]  I think most people are good.
[00:46:54.377 --> 00:46:55.598]  I think most police are good.
[00:46:56.058 --> 00:46:59.662]  I think most people in the government have somewhat good intentions.
[00:47:00.323 --> 00:47:01.344]  I've talked to senators.
[00:47:01.704 --> 00:47:22.683]  Yeah, look what's happening though, but think about in the last few years, like before the last three years, how many senators or legislators or high-level military or CIA or FBI officials were actually, did you feel that they were actually converting and coming over to, you know, the good side instead of the bad side?
[00:47:22.703 --> 00:47:25.946]  I mean, I get emails from all of those guys.
[00:47:26.767 --> 00:47:28.588]  Because they want help with their health.
[00:47:28.688 --> 00:47:32.929]  Most of them have been poisoned in some way or another in Iraq or Afghanistan or something like that.
[00:47:32.989 --> 00:47:33.710]  And high-level generals.
[00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:34.730]  How could they not, though?
[00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:35.750]  All of that.
[00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:36.871]  And they know.
[00:47:37.031 --> 00:47:40.032]  It's like, this is, they know what's going on.
[00:47:40.052 --> 00:47:53.557]  That's why I was kind of excited whenever they came out and said, oh, wait a second now, we have insiders in the CIA, the FBI, the NSA and everything that are whistleblowers that are giving Wikileaks this information that are coming forward.
[00:47:53.597 --> 00:47:53.877]  I was like,
[00:47:54.437 --> 00:47:55.838]  Well, it's about time, you know.
[00:47:56.398 --> 00:48:00.339]  They have the information, so I think we've made good strides.
[00:48:00.679 --> 00:48:04.401]  Obviously not that, not there, but... I totally agree.
[00:48:04.441 --> 00:48:05.981]  There is a shift, a complete shift.
[00:48:06.001 --> 00:48:06.862]  There's a great shift going on.
[00:48:06.882 --> 00:48:09.283]  I'm not mentioning this to say that everything's terrible.
[00:48:09.583 --> 00:48:10.803]  It's not that at all.
[00:48:10.943 --> 00:48:19.026]  It's just that so many people are in a trance where they think that everything's lilacs and daffodils all the time and that everyone's great and Hillary Clinton doesn't, you know, is an angel creature.
[00:48:19.046 --> 00:48:19.727]  No, they just watch CNN.
[00:48:19.807 --> 00:48:20.367]  Yeah, they just watch CNN.
[00:48:20.407 --> 00:48:20.607]  No, no, no.
[00:48:37.225 --> 00:48:49.111]  Definitely within the last, I'd say, two years really starting, maybe four years, but just over driving right now, like 180 miles per hour down the highway, people are 100% saying, hey, I can't do this anymore.
[00:48:49.131 --> 00:48:53.093]  You know, I might have been doing something before, like that was a little schemey or whatever.
[00:48:53.373 --> 00:48:54.033]  They're done with it.
[00:48:54.294 --> 00:48:55.274]  Look at all the whistleblowers.
[00:48:55.314 --> 00:48:56.715]  Look at all the people that support WikiLeaks.
[00:48:57.015 --> 00:48:58.296]  Everyone is tired of it.
[00:48:58.816 --> 00:49:01.617]  And I think they're grasping the fullness of what we've been accepting.
[00:49:01.917 --> 00:49:04.719]  Like we've been just accepting getting punched in the face every single day.
[00:49:05.679 --> 00:49:06.619]  All of our lives.
[00:49:07.119 --> 00:49:12.561]  And at the same time, though, yeah, I'm self-aware enough also to realize that we live in America, okay?
[00:49:12.841 --> 00:49:14.981]  We're sitting here at NAC in a beautiful studio.
[00:49:15.722 --> 00:49:17.062]  We have all this nice stuff.
[00:49:17.082 --> 00:49:19.983]  I have, like, crystal water here from Italy.
[00:49:20.063 --> 00:49:21.063]  Italian water, okay?
[00:49:21.523 --> 00:49:29.945]  I understand also my luxury and that there are people literally in third world countries dying in pools of diarrhea.
[00:49:30.025 --> 00:49:33.026]  Like, go walk down the street and they fall into a tank of feces, okay?
[00:49:34.066 --> 00:49:35.127]  But that's not what I want to create.
[00:49:35.167 --> 00:49:38.710]  Is that what the Clinton Foundation was supposed to not let happen?
[00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:41.732]  That's what a lot of these corrupt people will lead us into.
[00:49:42.412 --> 00:49:52.340]  That's what we will be led into with stars and stripes and propaganda and just, oh it's so amazing, come along with us in our dream where we make money off of you.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:50:01.647]  It's like when I went into CVS the other day and I saw somebody get, in the health spectrum on this one, he got a Miller Lite and like a ramen noodle.
[00:50:02.629 --> 00:50:10.901]  And he checked out, it was like $3 or whatever, and she goes, this is the worst part, it was so normal to them, she goes, that dinner right there or whatever, or lunch?
[00:50:10.921 --> 00:50:13.805]  And he's like, yep, that's my lunch or dinner or whatever.
[00:50:14.306 --> 00:50:15.628]  And she was like, oh, good for you!
[00:50:15.708 --> 00:50:17.070]  Like, it wasn't like...
[00:50:17.811 --> 00:50:18.492]  Wait a minute!
[00:50:18.772 --> 00:50:20.294]  That's your lunch or your dinner?
[00:50:20.314 --> 00:50:21.515]  Do you eat that every single day?
[00:50:21.535 --> 00:50:22.877]  A huge Miller Lite this big?
[00:50:22.917 --> 00:50:24.599]  Like double size and ramen noodles?
[00:50:24.619 --> 00:50:25.420]  Like that's what you're eating?
[00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:27.182]  It was, oh you got some lunch there?
[00:50:28.163 --> 00:50:29.664]  You know, no big deal, nonchalant.
[00:50:29.825 --> 00:50:31.667]  Which means people come in all the time and do that.
[00:50:32.107 --> 00:50:34.029]  And see, they're not bad for doing that.
[00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:36.272]  They're not stupid even for doing that.
[00:50:36.532 --> 00:50:37.593]  They don't deserve
[00:50:38.254 --> 00:50:49.258]  What is happening to them, because some high-level executive and some government institution individual decided to go out for dinner one time and shake hands on a deal where they can put toxic junk in the food.
[00:50:49.498 --> 00:50:50.598]  And it's not debatable.
[00:50:50.938 --> 00:50:52.219]  It's not debatable at all.
[00:50:52.699 --> 00:51:04.403]  And instead of talking about it, and instead of thinking about why are we putting that crap in there in the first place that's killing people, costing us billions of dollars, we saw that the endocrine disruptors, the hormone
[00:51:05.083 --> 00:51:10.870]  ...issue, the estrogen mimickers are causing billions of dollars into the food supply by putting in the food supply every single year.
[00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:13.773]  Alright, we gotta hit another break, but we will be back.
[00:51:14.033 --> 00:51:18.178]  Remember, infowareslife.com, 30% off SuperMetal Vitality, 30% off SuperMetal X2.
[00:51:18.218 --> 00:51:20.601]  Fun people that actually care about you.
[00:51:20.621 --> 00:51:21.802]  There's no junk in those products.
[00:51:21.822 --> 00:51:25.186]  We'll be right back with Dr. Groot to talk about this new Super Bug.
[00:51:28.761 --> 00:51:34.465]  I want to see 10 million viewers tune in over the 50-plus hours, and that's where you come in.
[00:51:34.905 --> 00:51:36.626]  You are the heart and blood of the InfoWars.
[00:51:36.946 --> 00:51:48.213]  If you spread the link to InfoWars.com forward slash show and point out that this is the alternative new media, this is the rebellion, then all of you are riding right beside us, not behind us.
[00:51:48.593 --> 00:51:54.156]  So spread the word by Paul Reveres, no matter where you live in the world, to Information Warfare Arms.
[00:51:54.477 --> 00:51:57.539]  The globalists are coming, and they will be met on the field.
[00:51:58.739 --> 00:52:01.441]  Look, I'm not going to sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:52:01.621 --> 00:52:04.723]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:52:05.003 --> 00:52:05.783]  Because it's already here.
[00:52:06.163 --> 00:52:06.824]  It's been announced.
[00:52:07.184 --> 00:52:10.646]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:52:11.066 --> 00:52:13.007]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:52:13.107 --> 00:52:14.668]  A new battleship in the fight.
[00:52:14.848 --> 00:52:15.869]  InfoWars Live.
[00:52:16.049 --> 00:52:16.869]  Available right now.
[00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:18.430]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:21.332]  Are you going to sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[00:52:21.972 --> 00:52:22.913]  Or are you going to be part of history?
[00:52:23.493 --> 00:52:26.497]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:52:26.997 --> 00:52:27.578]  Take action!
[00:52:41.007 --> 00:52:44.569]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:52:44.589 --> 00:52:46.951]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:52:47.311 --> 00:52:50.814]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:52:50.874 --> 00:52:53.996]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:52:54.496 --> 00:52:59.299]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.661]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:53:02.021 --> 00:53:06.404]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:53:06.604 --> 00:53:08.646]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:53:09.227 --> 00:53:10.708]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:53:10.868 --> 00:53:11.108]  Exactly.
[00:53:11.128 --> 00:53:14.932]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:53:15.433 --> 00:53:22.700]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:23.440]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[00:53:28.132 --> 00:53:34.297]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:53:34.678 --> 00:53:37.560]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:43.105]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:53:43.525 --> 00:53:49.490]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:52.773]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:53:52.933 --> 00:53:54.374]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[00:53:54.574 --> 00:53:58.715]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:53:58.895 --> 00:54:01.776]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:54:01.836 --> 00:54:03.417]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:54:03.517 --> 00:54:06.698]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:54:06.978 --> 00:54:09.298]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:54:09.578 --> 00:54:10.539]  It's in powder form.
[00:54:10.639 --> 00:54:13.339]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:14.120]  I take this.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.920]  This is the product that I take.
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:18.001]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.

[00:54:31.172 --> 00:54:44.403]  And I'll tell you what, also, I do want to remind everybody that at Infowarslife, I know I mentioned it before leaving, but I don't think the severity of it is... I'm not even good enough to talk about how important it is to fund things that you believe in, right?
[00:54:44.964 --> 00:54:45.564]  Infowarslife

[00:55:13.123 --> 00:55:16.686]  Instead of going to Starbucks, how about actually fund something that does make a difference?
[00:55:16.706 --> 00:55:23.851]  Just a note on that, I've read through the majority of the product reviews on Internet of Things Live.
[00:55:23.911 --> 00:55:25.373]  Which look fake, but they're so good.
[00:55:25.393 --> 00:55:25.853]  You know what?
[00:55:25.873 --> 00:55:27.134]  It's a third party.
[00:55:27.394 --> 00:55:29.316]  It's a third party review site.
[00:55:29.436 --> 00:55:35.721]  I love to do that because I like to see how the products work on people because it takes me a long time to develop the products.
[00:55:36.321 --> 00:55:49.785]  And to make sure that we source all the materials and going down to the farms and looking make sure they're doing everything right and testing all the raw materials and I mean it's not easy to put together something that you know is going to create change in someone's life.
[00:55:50.486 --> 00:55:54.747]  And how awesome is it to be able to go home every single day
[00:55:55.845 --> 00:56:00.447]  And read the true results that people are getting.
[00:56:00.587 --> 00:56:12.271]  And not only that, look at all of that support that Alex puts back into hiring new reporters and spreading the information, the truth, all over the world.
[00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:27.550]  It really is life-changing and I think about years from now when our kids are growing up and they say you know in the history books and they're reading in schools hopefully it won't be the type of schools that they're in now but
[00:56:28.834 --> 00:56:54.813]  You know, looking back, and when they're saying, you know, during this election, or during the internet boom, when all this information was getting out, and, you know, they're talking to their children, and they're saying, you know, my dad was part of that, or all the people out there watching right now that are part of this revolution that have educated themselves, when your children look at you years from now and say, you know, Dad,
[00:56:55.814 --> 00:56:57.375]  Thanks for doing all that.
[00:56:57.475 --> 00:57:04.479]  Thanks for being part of that and bringing, you know, making America the kind of place that I can live again.
[00:57:04.499 --> 00:57:05.300]  I mean, let's hope.
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:07.761]  I mean, I always like to have hope and faith and everything.
[00:57:07.801 --> 00:57:11.163]  Let's hope that that's what's happening in the future.
[00:57:11.343 --> 00:57:12.284]  I think there's no question.
[00:57:12.384 --> 00:57:16.787]  We've already broken past so many barriers.
[00:57:17.167 --> 00:57:18.328]  We've already done so much.
[00:57:18.348 --> 00:57:20.549]  Not just we as, oh, we are sitting here, I mean.
[00:57:20.729 --> 00:57:21.890]  No, it's we the people.
[00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:22.671]  Yes, we the people.
[00:57:22.891 --> 00:57:25.172]  We're the ones that create change.
[00:57:25.253 --> 00:57:31.137]  I mean, by not buying Roundup, you know, to spray the toxic pesticides on our lawns.
[00:57:31.517 --> 00:57:34.479]  By not buying, look what happened with genetically modified foods.
[00:57:34.519 --> 00:57:36.941]  I mean, that was a secret program by Monsanto.
[00:57:37.001 --> 00:57:38.602]  It was exposed year after year.
[00:57:38.642 --> 00:57:40.103]  We fought it, we fought it, we fought it.
[00:57:40.583 --> 00:57:44.006]  You and I were on Capitol Hill speaking about the dark act.
[00:57:44.086 --> 00:57:44.747]  No, about a year ago.
[00:57:44.827 --> 00:57:54.775]  It's all of the things that we do to support the organic movement, to support all these things, and people coming forward, people coming forward against fracking!
[00:57:55.015 --> 00:57:57.457]  You know, look what that did to the oil and gas industry.
[00:57:57.498 --> 00:58:02.001]  I mean, things that are literally destroying the environment, and it's...
[00:58:02.862 --> 00:58:09.149]  Why do you think the big companies, Coca-Cola, all those companies now are buying organic and they're all making commitments.
[00:58:09.529 --> 00:58:11.091]  They're getting rid of the high fructose corn syrup.
[00:58:11.111 --> 00:58:22.563]  Get rid of high fructose corn syrup, get rid of the chemicals, the pesticide, artificial sweeteners, all the things that we hate now and that we're saying are bad and have been known by our government to cause disease for years and years and years.
[00:58:22.723 --> 00:58:24.164]  Right, so let's talk about that.
[00:58:25.706 --> 00:58:29.430]  It's one thing to not even address haters, right?
[00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:30.371]  Not even so-called haters.
[00:58:30.391 --> 00:58:39.280]  Not even address people that would sit back and scoff at all this because a lot of people, unfortunately, like I said, are in these self-made prisons where they can't open themselves up ideologically.
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:46.607]  It's important to speak to every single person listening and say, in my view, if you can just do 10%
[00:58:48.729 --> 00:58:49.230]  Of anything.
[00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:52.552]  Like if you could just do 10% more, like if you just care 10% more, right?
[00:58:52.853 --> 00:59:01.480]  Like yeah, if you go to the store and you actually just decide to buy something that's not full of crap because you want to monetarily vote for something better, right?
[00:59:02.381 --> 00:59:03.502]  You've already had a major victory.
[00:59:03.762 --> 00:59:07.606]  If you even want to share this video, if you want to share this stream, you've had a major victory.
[00:59:08.286 --> 00:59:10.827]  It's the little tiny things like that that actually make a difference.
[00:59:11.308 --> 00:59:13.049]  And it's actually tuning into this stuff.
[00:59:13.609 --> 00:59:16.791]  Your brain is needing to be on a diet too.
[00:59:17.071 --> 00:59:17.871]  Like your body, right?
[00:59:17.891 --> 00:59:22.854]  You can't just watch reality television and American Idol all day and expect to feel good.
[00:59:23.194 --> 00:59:24.675]  You have to divvy up your intake.
[00:59:24.695 --> 00:59:26.876]  Like you have to have good quality content intake.
[00:59:27.096 --> 00:59:30.258]  You have to be able to sit down and really think about the things we're talking about now.
[00:59:30.598 --> 00:59:33.720]  You have to sit down and think about ideologically and philosophically things.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.481]  And on the flip side, you have to have time for rest and relaxation.
[00:59:36.521 --> 00:59:37.182]  You have to do all that.
[00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:44.696]  But the problem is I think we get like swept up in this tunnel of nothingness where there's no room for any free thinking.
[00:59:44.716 --> 00:59:47.599]  There's no room for any of that because free thinking is dangerous.
[00:59:47.979 --> 00:59:50.622]  If you have a population full of free thinkers, what's going to happen?
[00:59:51.162 --> 00:59:54.225]  They're not going to go along with whatever narrative you feed them anymore.
[00:59:54.485 --> 00:59:55.987]  They're not going to listen anymore.
[00:59:57.468 --> 01:00:04.875]  Free thinkers are very dangerous, especially for a government system that relies on control through domination and scaring people.
[01:00:05.115 --> 01:00:05.615]  You know what I mean?
[01:00:06.196 --> 01:00:10.659]  And so when we talk about the idea of going out and doing something, like you talk about fracking, okay?
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.082]  Some listeners probably think fracking is great, okay?
[01:00:13.282 --> 01:00:15.343]  There's some people in this building that think fracking is great.
[01:00:16.124 --> 01:00:18.006]  Am I the foremost expert on fracking?
[01:00:18.087 --> 01:00:18.527]  Absolutely not.
[01:00:18.908 --> 01:00:20.770]  Am I even the foremost expert on GMOs?
[01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:21.290]  Absolutely not.
[01:00:21.571 --> 01:00:29.721]  But you know what I do know is that I care enough to look into it to my capacity to talk to experts and try and if I believe in it to expose something against it, right?
[01:00:30.021 --> 01:00:31.022]  Just like we're talking about now.
[01:00:31.423 --> 01:00:33.565]  So I'm totally open also to the idea of
[01:00:34.446 --> 01:00:37.989]  Some of the things that I've fought for, I've already changed my positions on, right?
[01:00:38.310 --> 01:00:42.954]  Some of the things that I, four or five years ago, you'd ask me, I'd say, no way, no way, that's horrible.
[01:00:43.194 --> 01:00:45.196]  I've even changed and upgraded my positions on.
[01:00:45.516 --> 01:00:48.258]  Because I'm not a politician where I'd be called a flip-flopper.
[01:00:48.619 --> 01:00:52.042]  I'm an evolving human being with a mind that can change my mind.
[01:00:52.242 --> 01:00:56.406]  But the key is that I actually care enough to stand up for what I believe in, right?
[01:00:56.886 --> 01:01:02.109]  So at the same time, I think the problem that we have isn't even that people are wrong on minute little issues.
[01:01:02.149 --> 01:01:02.809]  Like, guess what?
[01:01:02.849 --> 01:01:04.570]  We talked about BPA, you talked about it.
[01:01:05.131 --> 01:01:08.473]  I mean, basically your whole life is what's kind of what started your whole mission.
[01:01:09.113 --> 01:01:17.678]  Billions of dollars in taxpayer money lost because people are dying from it in the water bottles and in the money in the prints on these papers right now.
[01:01:18.078 --> 01:01:18.258]  Okay?
[01:01:18.538 --> 01:01:19.339]  Billions of dollars.
[01:01:19.699 --> 01:01:21.300]  People are dying from it.
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:23.080]  It is not a funny joke.
[01:01:23.421 --> 01:01:24.521]  It is not debatable.
[01:01:24.861 --> 01:01:26.462]  And the FDA says it's totally fine.
[01:01:26.762 --> 01:01:29.904]  They did finally get out of baby bottles, but they say it's totally fine.
[01:01:29.924 --> 01:01:31.625]  And we're just pushing and pushing and pushing.
[01:01:31.885 --> 01:01:32.585]  Sign the forms!
[01:01:33.065 --> 01:01:34.066]  Get the FDA to ban this!
[01:01:34.366 --> 01:01:35.547]  No, it's totally great.
[01:01:35.627 --> 01:01:36.307]  It's totally fine.
[01:01:36.567 --> 01:01:36.747]  Okay?
[01:01:37.167 --> 01:01:38.608]  So we were 100% right on that.
[01:01:39.148 --> 01:01:40.948]  100% right on so many different things.
[01:01:41.328 --> 01:01:55.073]  Including, it jarred me when, I think it was AstraZeneca, they did a release, a press release, where they couldn't believe that the gut, and I don't want to get too deep into these, they're just key points, like, they couldn't believe the gut affected mental illness.
[01:01:55.373 --> 01:01:59.634]  And they said, if someone would have told this to me five years ago, I would have said they are crazy.
[01:02:00.314 --> 01:02:01.135]  How about like 25 years ago?
[01:02:02.595 --> 01:02:03.417]  I mean, come on!
[01:02:03.757 --> 01:02:07.384]  You didn't know there was a relationship, and now it's all 100% on everything!
[01:02:07.424 --> 01:02:14.097]  It's on Scientific American, it's on WIRED, it's like... This is kinda weird, but your gut actually links to your mental health and your overall well-being.
[01:02:14.137 --> 01:02:14.397]  It's like...
[01:02:15.222 --> 01:02:16.203]  Yeah, 100%.
[01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:19.085]  So people can nitpick at little things, right?
[01:02:20.266 --> 01:02:21.467]  People can nitpick at little things.
[01:02:21.807 --> 01:02:24.309]  Maybe they don't agree with certain things about what we say, whatever.
[01:02:24.329 --> 01:02:25.450]  Okay, great.
[01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:28.892]  You can nitpick at those things, but meanwhile, people are dying.
[01:02:29.472 --> 01:02:32.435]  Meanwhile, we care about it, and what are most people doing?
[01:02:32.475 --> 01:02:35.477]  Not the listeners of this, not the people that are engaged, but what are most people doing?
[01:02:35.817 --> 01:02:43.063]  Instead, they're defending the corporation selling you the junk that's killing you, and they think they're somehow empowered and smarter.
[01:02:43.383 --> 01:02:53.491]  They're just so intellectual, they're gonna sit there, and actually, this research paper here, funded by the very corporation that's selling it, and the FDA looked it over, they, guess what?
[01:02:53.571 --> 01:02:58.995]  They went to dinner in New York City, and probably did some coke together, and shook hands on it, and said, haha, you're good, buddy.
[01:02:59.015 --> 01:02:59.736]  Okay?
[01:02:59.996 --> 01:03:02.778]  That's your amazing academia at work over there.
[01:03:03.018 --> 01:03:03.158]  Okay.
[01:03:21.576 --> 01:03:22.056]  We're good to go.
[01:03:39.716 --> 01:03:48.027]  Someone about this the other day, they were like, there's this pill that could, it could stop aging, it's an anti-aging pill, and it could get rid of wrinkles, and oh my god!
[01:03:48.047 --> 01:03:54.195]  I'm like, well, why not talk about why you get wrinkles in the first place when you're 30 years old?
[01:03:54.936 --> 01:03:57.618]  Why not talk about why you're aging rapidly in the first place?
[01:03:57.698 --> 01:04:13.548]  Why not talk about why these drone pilots who are drinking Mountain Dew and Red Bull all night and feel like crap and eating Cheetos, maybe they're not the best operating drone pilots because they have a horrible lifestyle that the government said is totally healthy and they feel like crap.
[01:04:13.769 --> 01:04:19.252]  And I'm not trying to rant and I want you to comment on all this, but God, that is what's infuriating.
[01:04:19.452 --> 01:04:20.593]  That is why people are stressed out.
[01:04:20.633 --> 01:04:22.434]  They get it because they see it.
[01:04:22.494 --> 01:04:23.275]  There's like a huge
[01:04:23.755 --> 01:04:24.636]  Nail in our arm.
[01:04:24.656 --> 01:04:25.537]  And we're like, take the nail out.
[01:04:25.557 --> 01:04:26.398]  They're like, there's no nail.
[01:04:26.879 --> 01:04:30.683]  What we need to do is we need to graft a new arm to replace this arm that has the nail in it.
[01:04:30.703 --> 01:04:31.944]  They're like, what?
[01:04:32.405 --> 01:04:37.370]  They're like, we're going to spend $50 billion to build a cybernetic arm that replaces your arm because yours has a nail in it.
[01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:39.012]  It's like, well, just take the nail out.
[01:04:39.032 --> 01:04:39.913]  Just remove the nail.
[01:04:40.834 --> 01:04:42.776]  No, we can't remove the nail.
[01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:43.477]  It doesn't exist.
[01:04:44.994 --> 01:04:49.137]  Well, that's a lot that you covered right there, and you're absolutely right.
[01:04:49.517 --> 01:05:02.607]  One of the things that I always tell people is that, you know, academia, all of these research studies, all this stuff comes out, and they all talk about the symptoms, and they don't talk about the root cause of the problem.
[01:05:03.846 --> 01:05:10.732]  If you talk about the root cause of the problem, and you teach people why they have something, then they understand how to get rid of it.
[01:05:10.752 --> 01:05:13.954]  And that goes back to when we were talking to patients all the time in our clinic.
[01:05:14.615 --> 01:05:30.888]  Once they understood, and we explained to them about the dietary toxins, and the toxins in the air, and the food, and the water, and how that works on their bowel, and how those chemicals are congested in the liver, and then they run into the bloodstream, and then once they're in the bloodstream, they start, you know,
[01:05:32.334 --> 01:05:37.506]  Getting laid down in different organs and systems and that's what causes disease to begin with.
[01:05:38.936 --> 01:05:42.037]  Then they understand how important cleansing and everything really is.
[01:05:42.057 --> 01:05:45.817]  I mean, look, it doesn't have to be complicated.
[01:05:45.937 --> 01:05:52.438]  For example, you can heal the body very simply with nothing but purified water.
[01:05:52.778 --> 01:05:56.639]  Why do you think water fasting was used in all the ancient texts?
[01:05:57.219 --> 01:06:07.121]  I mean, we've gotten to the point where we've taken something so simple to where someone could go to up in the mountains to a pristine, clean water source.
[01:06:07.981 --> 01:06:15.404]  And no matter what problem or health condition they were suffering from, they would drink this water.
[01:06:15.845 --> 01:06:24.208]  Water is the ultimate detoxifier and cleanser, and that's why you're going to start seeing more and more people start talking about water fasting and cleansing, by the way, because it's so effective.
[01:06:24.848 --> 01:06:32.332]  They could just drink pure, clean water and put themselves in a nice, calm environment, and pretty much everything would go away.
[01:06:33.223 --> 01:06:34.424]  Right, and they knew that.
[01:06:34.444 --> 01:06:42.689]  I mean, the high-level globalists have known how effective and how powerful water is.
[01:06:43.089 --> 01:06:48.172]  And the reason I'm saying this is, it doesn't have to be where you have to be a millionaire to be healthy.
[01:06:48.752 --> 01:06:48.972]  No.
[01:06:49.072 --> 01:06:52.933]  All you need is clean water and a clean mind and you can meditate.
[01:06:52.973 --> 01:06:53.634]  That's free!
[01:06:54.094 --> 01:07:00.636]  It's been proven that just water by itself is one of the most powerful medicines in the world.
[01:07:01.256 --> 01:07:08.678]  Your self-healing mechanism that you were born with is the most powerful healing, is the most powerful healing method in the world.
[01:07:09.038 --> 01:07:16.581]  But you're taught from early ages to look out here and look out here and look out here for the answers or go trust a doctor over here.
[01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:21.863]  Instead of learning about yourself and learning about the power that you have within.
[01:07:22.303 --> 01:07:27.726]  All you have to do is say, okay, what do I need as a human to survive?
[01:07:28.486 --> 01:07:31.208]  Okay, I need water number one.
[01:07:31.228 --> 01:07:34.649]  You don't even need food really for that long.
[01:07:34.709 --> 01:07:36.970]  You can survive, you know, you die first without water.
[01:07:37.551 --> 01:07:38.591]  Pure clean water.
[01:07:39.131 --> 01:07:40.172]  Pure clean food.
[01:07:41.621 --> 01:07:42.882]  And a pure, clean mind.
[01:07:42.982 --> 01:07:47.704]  Or you need to be able to meditate or control your system by relaxation.
[01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:56.787]  There's been thousands of studies come out on meditation and how effective it is for boosting your immune system.
[01:07:57.007 --> 01:08:06.571]  Harvard came out with a study, I think it just came out a couple days ago today, and it says that meditation is just as effective as going on vacation.
[01:08:06.591 --> 01:08:09.332]  Yeah, you can do it every day.
[01:08:09.352 --> 01:08:10.433]  You can do it all day long.
[01:08:11.518 --> 01:08:13.740]  Regular meditation more beneficial than vacation.
[01:08:14.001 --> 01:08:17.444]  You know what's funny is we're always told that we need to get away from our primal state.
[01:08:17.764 --> 01:08:25.010]  Everything that makes us human in the first place, everything that makes us the amazing creatures that we are, that we survive so much.
[01:08:25.271 --> 01:08:26.592]  It's amazing what we survive, isn't it?
[01:08:26.652 --> 01:08:33.218]  I mean the junk that I've eaten throughout my entire life, the things I've been put, just the circumstances.
[01:08:33.258 --> 01:08:35.420]  I mean it's amazing I don't just get hit by a truck and die, right?
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:39.161]  And then, truly, the world is insane, alright?
[01:08:39.221 --> 01:08:40.901]  And we're alive this long, it's a miracle.
[01:08:41.361 --> 01:08:50.904]  But, then people would say, the detractors would say, well it's all genetic, and you're crazy, and none of that really matters, and what you said is, I could source this.
[01:08:51.304 --> 01:08:55.185]  Let me tell you, I'm gonna respond to that very clearly and concisely.
[01:08:55.205 --> 01:09:04.787]  I would challenge someone to eat a diet, this is a base extreme that'll prove it though, of Cheetos and Red Bull, that's all you're allowed to have.
[01:09:05.569 --> 01:09:05.909]  I would not.
[01:09:20.606 --> 01:09:25.411]  Some standard meat and some fruit and tons of water.
[01:09:25.891 --> 01:09:26.952]  And we're going to see how we feel.
[01:09:26.973 --> 01:09:27.393]  Okay?
[01:09:28.014 --> 01:09:34.920]  The person that eats Cheetos and Red Bull obviously is going to feel like crap, they're going to get sick, and they might even have a developing condition, right?
[01:09:35.281 --> 01:09:35.941]  Most likely would.
[01:09:36.986 --> 01:09:38.828]  Sure, genetics play a role, 100%.
[01:09:39.028 --> 01:09:39.808]  There's no question.
[01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:42.190]  And the insanity of life plays a role.
[01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:44.232]  I could have a heart attack right now and die, okay?
[01:09:44.632 --> 01:09:45.192]  We all could.
[01:09:45.273 --> 01:09:46.053]  Anything could happen.
[01:09:46.093 --> 01:09:50.957]  We never know the intricacies of our trillions of little cells and little things in our bodies all working together.
[01:09:51.257 --> 01:09:52.018]  Who knows?
[01:09:52.358 --> 01:10:00.945]  But if you're not at least taking a step towards doing something to prevent the death in the first place, and beyond that, people say, well, I don't want to live forever.
[01:10:01.485 --> 01:10:03.506]  Okay, well do you want to feel like crap when you're 35?
[01:10:03.646 --> 01:10:06.068]  Do you want to feel like crap when you're 50?
[01:10:06.548 --> 01:10:09.070]  Maybe you don't have to live to 100, but you're feeling like crap.
[01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:12.312]  And on top of that, you're making poor decisions and choices when you feel like crap.
[01:10:12.592 --> 01:10:18.775]  And when you buy into all the BS that you're fed, you're not even living in the true reality that you can.
[01:10:19.276 --> 01:10:21.877]  Where you're not confined by these self-made prisons.
[01:10:22.278 --> 01:10:25.740]  Because I embrace, and I know you do, and I think everyone listening,
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:31.104]  The trueness and fullness of humanity and the primal essence that makes us all real human beings.
[01:10:31.464 --> 01:10:33.726]  And I'm saying things that are crazy.
[01:10:34.087 --> 01:10:43.615]  Well, the armchair viewer that would obsess over all the things and they love to watch the mainstream media and they love to say we're crazy and write a blog post about it or whatever.
[01:10:44.255 --> 01:10:47.977]  That person is in a contrived state, right?
[01:10:48.037 --> 01:10:49.898]  Where they aren't even allowed.
[01:10:50.298 --> 01:10:52.479]  They're like the ultimate modern human being.
[01:10:52.699 --> 01:10:56.001]  They can't even begin to imagine sitting here talking about this stuff on air.
[01:10:56.021 --> 01:10:56.961]  They can't even imagine that.
[01:10:57.301 --> 01:10:59.182]  Because they've been neutered.
[01:10:59.202 --> 01:11:00.003]  Okay?
[01:11:00.283 --> 01:11:02.764]  And I don't mean that in a gender way.
[01:11:02.824 --> 01:11:06.186]  I just mean like ideologically and spiritually neutered.
[01:11:06.206 --> 01:11:07.246]  They've just been castrated.
[01:11:07.266 --> 01:11:07.907]  They've been cut off.
[01:11:07.927 --> 01:11:08.747]  They've been capped.
[01:11:09.147 --> 01:11:10.148]  They've been imprisoned.
[01:11:10.988 --> 01:11:13.889]  And for someone to be out of that realm is absurdity to them.
[01:11:14.329 --> 01:11:15.409]  It's totally crazy.
[01:11:15.649 --> 01:11:17.050]  I don't mean to get too esoteric here.
[01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:28.633]  No, I'm just letting people know that, you know, you have, if you can get a good clean water source that's for free or, you know, that's just one of the most, most beneficial things that you can do for your body.
[01:11:28.653 --> 01:11:30.193]  I know, you're over here trying to give good solutions.
[01:11:30.253 --> 01:11:33.034]  I'm getting totally esoteric, a hundred times crazier.
[01:11:33.334 --> 01:11:35.095]  Talking about how people are spiritually castrated.
[01:11:35.836 --> 01:11:40.859]  I actually printed some stuff because sleep is free also, right?
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.881]  And most people aren't getting enough sleep.
[01:11:43.101 --> 01:11:50.086]  People are all sick, and they never sleep, and they smoke, and they don't eat right, and they drink no water, and then they go, I don't know what's happening.
[01:11:50.126 --> 01:11:50.627]  What is going on?
[01:11:50.647 --> 01:11:51.987]  It's like, well, how much water do you drink?
[01:11:52.028 --> 01:11:53.108]  Well, I don't really drink water.
[01:11:53.609 --> 01:11:54.069]  I mean, how many?
[01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.810]  A glass a day?
[01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:55.490]  I don't do anything.
[01:11:55.670 --> 01:11:58.472]  They don't do anything, and then they get sick, and they don't work.
[01:11:58.692 --> 01:11:59.693]  It's just like this, though.
[01:11:59.893 --> 01:12:01.634]  To tie it into this, people
[01:12:02.575 --> 01:12:05.698]  Also, don't even know about any of this stuff going on.
[01:12:06.558 --> 01:12:09.020]  And then they ask, like, well, how's the country so screwed up?
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:09.961]  I'm moving to Canada.
[01:12:10.061 --> 01:12:11.883]  It's like, because you don't care.
[01:12:12.843 --> 01:12:15.325]  Because you don't talk about any of this stuff.
[01:12:15.626 --> 01:12:17.467]  I just print this stuff today.
[01:12:17.547 --> 01:12:19.449]  Like, it's all insane stuff today.
[01:12:20.189 --> 01:12:22.511]  Imagine, like, years and years and years.
[01:12:22.551 --> 01:12:23.812]  People don't even look at anything.
[01:12:24.153 --> 01:12:25.133]  You know, I travel around.
[01:12:25.173 --> 01:12:27.135]  I go to different colleges and stuff like that.
[01:12:27.255 --> 01:12:30.177]  And everywhere I go, they all have CNN on.
[01:12:30.297 --> 01:12:31.378]  And it just makes me sick.
[01:12:31.438 --> 01:12:31.899]  It's just like,
[01:12:33.524 --> 01:12:40.109]  You know, the manipulation of the news, I didn't realize how powerful it actually is, but it really is powerful.
[01:12:40.169 --> 01:12:44.171]  People just believe every single thing that they hear on TV.
[01:12:44.211 --> 01:12:46.573]  And I will say, though, I think a lot of people don't.
[01:12:46.793 --> 01:12:47.774]  I'm distrusting the media.
[01:12:47.814 --> 01:12:49.955]  Gallup polls show it's just an all-time high.
[01:12:49.975 --> 01:12:50.596]  People don't want it.
[01:12:50.636 --> 01:12:52.017]  That's why they're looking for anything else.
[01:12:52.037 --> 01:12:52.978]  They're just so desperate.
[01:12:53.918 --> 01:12:55.439]  They're deficient in real life.
[01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:58.742]  They're deficient in real life, and they just so badly want real life.
[01:12:59.062 --> 01:12:59.762]  That's all they want.
[01:12:59.782 --> 01:13:01.263]  They just want real news and information.
[01:13:01.283 --> 01:13:02.784]  They're like, God, if I could just have something real.
[01:13:03.085 --> 01:13:09.009]  And it's not even about the information as much as it is just breaking the paradigm where you're not allowed to be a human being.
[01:13:09.089 --> 01:13:09.409]  Like this.
[01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:10.990]  There's no teleprompter.
[01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:14.352]  There's mass consciousness now that's starting to take over.
[01:13:14.392 --> 01:13:16.494]  It's like the 100th monkey phenomenon, you know?
[01:13:16.574 --> 01:13:17.895]  Once the 100th monkey
[01:13:19.676 --> 01:13:24.278]  You know, washed his banana, then all the monkeys all over the world started doing it.
[01:13:24.398 --> 01:13:27.239]  I mean, there's been multiple studies that have proven that.
[01:13:27.299 --> 01:13:34.421]  And also, there's been a lot of studies done at the worldpeacegroup.org.
[01:13:34.521 --> 01:13:41.444]  And I brought this because we were talking earlier about the election and how much stress that's causing everybody all over the world.
[01:13:41.744 --> 01:13:47.346]  And that they even created election stress disorder, which is now a disorder.
[01:13:48.306 --> 01:13:55.430]  And so there's, going back to meditation... I would like to rename it officially, by the way, The Country is Screwed Up Disorder.
[01:13:56.210 --> 01:13:59.792]  And the cure is not to look at nice photos on Instagram, it's to actually do something about it.
[01:13:59.812 --> 01:14:00.132]  But go ahead.
[01:14:00.312 --> 01:14:09.097]  Well no, so the World Peace Group actually sat a lot of people down and they meditated and saw if they could actually create change.
[01:14:09.137 --> 01:14:11.278]  And research shows that when 1% of a population
[01:14:13.419 --> 01:14:22.305]  Learns how to meditate correctly, there's an immediate reversal of negative social trends within that society and an onset of positive ones.
[01:14:22.966 --> 01:14:32.212]  Typically in normal circumstances, crimes reduce, motor accidents reduce, divorces decline, business activity and employment rise, and so on.
[01:14:32.732 --> 01:14:41.439]  And there's over 50 research summaries that show how groups of specially trained meditators can prevent crime, terrorism, and even war
[01:14:42.479 --> 01:14:52.125]  There was a crime prevention project in Washington that showed a maximum 23.3% reversal in the predicted violent crime trend.
[01:14:52.686 --> 01:15:03.152]  Before the project, the chief of police in Washington had exclaimed that the only thing that would create a 20% drop in crime would be 20 inches of snow.
[01:15:04.754 --> 01:15:11.398]  And the Crime Prevention Project took place during the blistering summer weather, actually, and reduced crime by 23.3%.
[01:15:13.239 --> 01:15:15.860]  Lebanon Peace Project reduced war deaths by 76%.
[01:15:16.221 --> 01:15:28.348]  The Lebanon Peace Project involved a group of meditators meditating together in Jerusalem, and it was large enough to achieve this, they call it the super radiance effect.
[01:15:28.388 --> 01:15:32.331]  I mean, think about the power that we have already inside of us.
[01:15:33.789 --> 01:15:44.751]  Years ago, I was asked to be in a think tank and it was because the military was threatened that there was going to be a meteorite or an asteroid that was going to hit Earth.
[01:15:45.031 --> 01:15:47.451]  I mean, and we still have that going on today, right?
[01:15:47.911 --> 01:16:02.334]  So they reached out to a lot of different people and I, you know, was on the list because I was part of some top secret projects years ago and learning how to utilize the mind and I was a good problem solver.
[01:16:03.752 --> 01:16:14.141]  And they reached out and they said they had the world's best scientists that had been working on how do we divert an asteroid or a planet, anything, from hitting the Earth.
[01:16:14.841 --> 01:16:19.205]  And they had said, we've been working on this for close to 10 years with the top scientists in the world.
[01:16:19.985 --> 01:16:20.646]  I said, really?
[01:16:20.746 --> 01:16:22.407]  Well, you've been working on it the wrong way.
[01:16:22.748 --> 01:16:26.330]  So they said, well, how would you do it?
[01:16:27.242 --> 01:16:31.064]  I said, well, you guys need to understand how powerful the mind is.
[01:16:32.024 --> 01:16:46.630]  If you got a thousand people or two thousand people that are very powerful, you know, the indigo children, the super children that have been born into this, uh, into the world that have, you know, real high powers that are being taken away.
[01:16:46.650 --> 01:16:49.311]  If you concentrate
[01:16:50.325 --> 01:16:58.368]  Those, that many people focusing and they do it the right way, that will turn the asteroid or whatever away from the Earth.
[01:16:58.489 --> 01:17:00.309]  And they basically hung up on me and the phone.
[01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:05.031]  And now, no seriously, that's how powerful the mind is!
[01:17:05.572 --> 01:17:15.476]  And now you're actually seeing proof with over 50 studies and this is not, you know, thousands of people, this is just a group of people in a city that are all coming together and meditating for positive change.
[01:17:15.516 --> 01:17:17.897]  I can only imagine you on the phone with a bunch of military people.
[01:17:18.317 --> 01:17:21.518]  And they're like, alright, we gotta put the best minds together and you tell them that?
[01:17:21.558 --> 01:17:22.438]  They were probably like, what?
[01:17:22.478 --> 01:17:23.659]  Yeah, no, they thought I was crazy.
[01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:26.039]  I was like, you're thinking about the whole thing the wrong way.
[01:17:26.059 --> 01:17:27.880]  The way you think about it is you need to think about the power that we have.
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.661]  Think about it at the most base level, look.
[01:17:30.021 --> 01:17:30.701]  Think about it like this.
[01:17:31.401 --> 01:17:35.122]  You're on like, you're talking about like level 100 possibility right here.
[01:17:35.162 --> 01:17:36.403]  Let's just go to level 1 for a second.
[01:17:36.883 --> 01:17:39.404]  People can't even, I'm not just saying people can't even.
[01:17:39.504 --> 01:17:41.284]  Hey, I have a million problems.
[01:17:41.344 --> 01:17:43.085]  I'm a terrible person in some ways, okay?
[01:17:43.465 --> 01:17:46.826]  But a lot of people can't even spend one minute
[01:17:47.486 --> 01:17:49.949]  Alone with themselves, without distraction.
[01:17:50.609 --> 01:17:55.374]  Whether it's television, or some food, or sugary drinks, or stimulations, or iPhones.
[01:17:55.574 --> 01:17:58.177]  I mean, how many times do you go on your iPhone a day, like, constantly checking it?
[01:17:58.217 --> 01:17:58.858]  I do it all the time.
[01:17:58.978 --> 01:17:59.298]  I know.
[01:17:59.378 --> 01:18:03.843]  People can't even spend a second or a minute with themselves in their own head, right?
[01:18:03.963 --> 01:18:05.565]  Let alone rest it for five seconds.
[01:18:05.885 --> 01:18:08.227]  So what happens, I think, with meditation, whatever it is,
[01:18:09.108 --> 01:18:14.250]  Is it basically just allows you to turn off that insanity for one second?
[01:18:14.290 --> 01:18:15.830]  You've been locked into a grid.
[01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:16.611]  It's like the Matrix.
[01:18:16.911 --> 01:18:20.672]  You've been locked into a grid system where we're just constantly hooked up on stuff.
[01:18:20.712 --> 01:18:22.753]  We're just on the computer eight, ten hours a day.
[01:18:23.113 --> 01:18:23.873]  We're on our phones.
[01:18:24.253 --> 01:18:31.876]  Before you go to sleep, most people are on their phones, like checking Twitter and stuff, getting cocaine-like highs from Facebook likes and retweets and stuff.
[01:18:32.296 --> 01:18:39.619]  So if you can distance yourself from the grid, like the Borg, for just 5 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, I try to do it about 20 minutes a day.
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:51.505]  If you can do that, something amazing happens, you get back with your primal essence, you get back with who you really are, your intention, your purpose, and everything you believe in, and you aren't so distracted.
[01:18:51.765 --> 01:18:53.446]  So that's why I think amazing things can happen.
[01:18:53.726 --> 01:18:58.668]  No, and it goes back to letting people know how powerful you really are, okay?
[01:18:58.768 --> 01:19:11.192]  God created you as a powerful being, and you will see in the future how people will start to understand how powerful their thoughts are, how powerful their words are, what you speak.
[01:19:11.692 --> 01:19:18.615]  Sound, now the research with harmonics and sound is coming out, where sound is actually, can manifest things.
[01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:25.419]  You know, this sounds hokey-pokey right now, but this is where we're going and people will realize.
[01:19:25.759 --> 01:19:29.021]  I've spent my whole life looking into the power of these things.
[01:19:29.061 --> 01:19:35.945]  I mean, it mentions meditation like 28 times in the Bible and all these ancient cultures.
[01:19:35.985 --> 01:19:37.346]  I keep going back to that because
[01:19:38.126 --> 01:19:42.328]  There's so much information that's been buried from what these individuals did.
[01:19:42.368 --> 01:19:48.510]  Of course, they didn't have the kind of technology that we have today, but is technology a good thing or is technology a bad thing?
[01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:52.012]  I mean, like you said, it's taking us away from ourselves.
[01:19:52.312 --> 01:19:54.493]  I'm a culprit of it too.
[01:19:54.513 --> 01:19:58.655]  I mean, I end up checking my phone and everything like that, but it's...
[01:19:59.255 --> 01:20:06.058]  But I also, I also meditate, I think positive thoughts and I try to meditate, you know, sometimes even for up to four hours a day.
[01:20:06.098 --> 01:20:15.923]  It's literally changed my life and it's only because I was challenged years ago and, you know, so many people were asking me, what are the benefits of meditation?
[01:20:16.243 --> 01:20:18.604]  I don't know, you know, I had to basically force myself
[01:20:19.284 --> 01:20:28.029]  To meditate, starting out with 5 minutes and then going to 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes and then it literally changed my life and it continues to change my life.
[01:20:28.129 --> 01:20:40.275]  I mean, it's extremely powerful, takes away all the stress, detaches me from the society and it's made me more spiritual and it's helped my health.
[01:20:40.675 --> 01:20:41.756]  I know, you're a master of it.
[01:21:14.617 --> 01:21:18.560]  Viewers tune in over the 50 plus hours and that's where you come in.
[01:21:19.001 --> 01:21:20.722]  You are the heart and blood of the InfoWars.
[01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:32.311]  If you spread the link to InfoWars.com forward slash show and point out that this is the alternative new media, this is the rebellion, then all of you are riding right beside us, not behind us.
[01:21:32.692 --> 01:21:38.256]  So spread the word by Paul Revere's, no matter where you live in the world, to Information Warfare Arms.
[01:21:38.576 --> 01:21:41.639]  The globalists are coming and they will be met on the field.
[01:21:44.102 --> 01:21:47.524]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:21:47.885 --> 01:21:55.009]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:21:55.610 --> 01:22:03.895]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:22:04.256 --> 01:22:08.398]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:22:08.659 --> 01:22:13.622]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:22:14.242 --> 01:22:18.325]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:22:18.485 --> 01:22:21.547]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:22:21.887 --> 01:22:32.975]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:22:33.035 --> 01:22:35.717]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[01:22:35.937 --> 01:22:41.901]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[01:22:42.421 --> 01:22:48.585]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:22:48.965 --> 01:22:51.847]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:22:52.207 --> 01:22:57.370]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:22:57.790 --> 01:23:03.774]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:23:03.914 --> 01:23:07.056]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:23:07.196 --> 01:23:08.637]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:23:08.857 --> 01:23:13.001]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:23:13.181 --> 01:23:16.044]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:23:16.124 --> 01:23:17.706]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:23:17.786 --> 01:23:20.969]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:23:21.269 --> 01:23:23.592]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:23:23.872 --> 01:23:24.833]  It's in powder form.
[01:23:24.933 --> 01:23:27.636]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:23:27.816 --> 01:23:28.817]  I take this.
[01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:30.218]  This is the product that I take.

[01:25:18.773 --> 01:25:27.401]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces who are trying to sway public opinion and in a natural direction that only serves establishment agendas.
[01:25:27.621 --> 01:25:32.405]  But InfoWars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.

[01:25:42.132 --> 01:25:49.598]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:25:50.018 --> 01:25:57.664]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[01:25:57.924 --> 01:26:00.026]  As president, I will make it clear.
[01:26:00.886 --> 01:26:05.629]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[01:26:06.209 --> 01:26:11.572]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[01:26:11.612 --> 01:26:15.154]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[01:26:15.194 --> 01:26:17.975]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[01:26:18.035 --> 01:26:20.596]  We came, we saw, he died.
[01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:25.013]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[01:26:25.374 --> 01:26:28.859]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[01:26:29.059 --> 01:26:36.951]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:39.320]  The U.S.
[01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:42.981]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[01:26:43.341 --> 01:26:50.963]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[01:26:51.343 --> 01:26:53.663]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[01:26:53.683 --> 01:26:57.784]  Of course not, because she's... There's a really loud noise.
[01:26:58.324 --> 01:27:02.405]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[01:27:02.425 --> 01:27:04.646]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[01:27:08.422 --> 01:27:12.906]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:27:40.388 --> 01:27:44.591]  He still, when he talks about the very corrupt system, he means shipping our jobs and our wealth overseas.
[01:27:44.671 --> 01:27:49.634]  He means there being a different set of rules for people like Hillary Clinton and then another set of rules for the rest of us.
[01:27:50.074 --> 01:27:51.015]  That sure doesn't change.
[01:27:51.035 --> 01:27:55.117]  We're still talking about the Clinton Foundation and the mess that that is.
[01:27:55.517 --> 01:27:59.760]  We know now that Chelsea Clinton's using money from the Clinton Foundation for her own wedding.
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:01.881]  We know that Bill Clinton Inc.
[01:28:02.021 --> 01:28:03.782]  was trying to get $66 million.
[01:28:03.822 --> 01:28:05.643]  We know that the Moroccan gave them $28 million.
[01:28:08.585 --> 01:28:15.588]  You know, when I celebrate my spouse's birthday, the country of Qatar doesn't usually cut us a million dollar check for our foundation.
[01:28:15.608 --> 01:28:32.194]  So, there are a lot of moving parts here, and I think what bothers people, what nagged them about Hillary Clinton, and why they're reluctant to give her that 51, 52, 54 percent margin in these blue states that President Obama carried to us with margins like that, has a lot to do with them just not trusting her.
[01:28:32.834 --> 01:28:39.564]  Kellyanne, with about 24 hours until the polls open, as you look back and as Donald Trump looks back over the last year and a half, does he have any regrets?
[01:28:39.824 --> 01:28:42.227]  Does he have regrets about something he said, something he did?
[01:28:42.267 --> 01:28:45.131]  Maybe it was the Muslim ban, maybe taking on a Gold Star family.
[01:28:45.432 --> 01:28:47.755]  When you talk privately, does he say, maybe I shouldn't have done that?
[01:28:47.935 --> 01:29:07.746]  Well, I won't reveal private conversations with any client, but he has said publicly, he was asked that question very recently on a different network, and he has said publicly that he has expressed regret, was a word he used, and he said particularly if he hurt anyone with his words, and I think that those who have been offended should receive that as, you know, as...
[01:29:08.306 --> 01:29:09.346]  What was he talking about there?
[01:29:09.386 --> 01:29:10.847]  Well, that's between him and them.
[01:29:11.207 --> 01:29:19.208]  And also, you know, when we had the incident a month ago, he went on TV right away and expressed he apologized.
[01:29:19.268 --> 01:29:21.969]  And he apologized privately to his family and he apologized to America.
[01:29:22.569 --> 01:29:27.150]  But, you know, I think the movement that he's built, people look at the full measure.
[01:29:33.021 --> 01:29:39.606]  We had to scramble to get Joe Biggs and Leanne McAdoo in here because WikiLeaks, new WikiLeaks information.
[01:29:39.946 --> 01:29:41.528]  I'm not even fully briefed on what it is.
[01:29:41.828 --> 01:29:42.749]  We're investigating it.
[01:29:42.789 --> 01:29:44.190]  They have some printouts that just came out.
[01:29:44.230 --> 01:29:48.653]  There was just one tweet about it, and now I guess it's kind of full-fledged into some more information.
[01:29:48.693 --> 01:29:49.974]  So we're talking about that.
[01:29:50.054 --> 01:29:54.678]  We've been talking about a lot of crazy stuff, but as per usual, no rest.
[01:29:54.998 --> 01:29:56.139]  No rest here whatsoever.
[01:29:56.499 --> 01:29:59.842]  There needs to be more madness and breaking news constantly coming out.
[01:30:01.770 --> 01:30:04.814]  And including that breaking noise over there.
[01:30:04.854 --> 01:30:05.354]  It's okay.
[01:30:05.394 --> 01:30:11.702]  It's because everyone was struggling to get in here because we had to get both of you guys in here and we didn't expect it.
[01:30:11.822 --> 01:30:13.163]  They're actually doing an awesome job.
[01:30:13.624 --> 01:30:16.027]  It was an unexpected kind of lapse there for a second.
[01:30:16.047 --> 01:30:16.868]  But anyway, so what's going on?
[01:30:17.168 --> 01:30:30.076]  All right, so I was on WikiLeaks like I normally am, going through all the stuff, and WikiLeaks just tweeted out, you know, the tax loophole that Donald Trump was using that Hillary Clinton keeps, you know, hitting him on.
[01:30:30.096 --> 01:30:34.198]  You know, you use it to kind of bypass it, to avoid paying taxes.
[01:30:34.559 --> 01:30:39.101]  Well, that tax code was created in 93 by Bill Clinton, her husband.
[01:30:39.241 --> 01:30:40.062]  It was introduced, yeah.
[01:30:40.082 --> 01:30:41.343]  Yeah, it was introduced by that.
[01:30:41.463 --> 01:30:43.504]  So here we have this guy out here.
[01:30:43.524 --> 01:30:44.785]  It's called tax avoidance.
[01:30:45.325 --> 01:30:49.968]  There's a big difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion, and that's what it is.
[01:30:49.988 --> 01:30:51.529]  One is illegal and one's not.
[01:30:51.609 --> 01:30:53.230]  One's legal and one is illegal, yes.
[01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:58.453]  Right, and Hillary Clinton herself took advantage of that loophole as recently as 2015.
[01:30:58.913 --> 01:31:04.697]  She also, you know, donated to charity in order to cut down on what she had to pay in taxes.
[01:31:04.717 --> 01:31:06.218]  Let's get real for a minute, guys.
[01:31:07.250 --> 01:31:11.273]  Everyone practices tax avoidance.
[01:31:11.574 --> 01:31:12.074]  Everyone should.
[01:31:12.094 --> 01:31:14.216]  As a businessman, it's your duty.
[01:31:14.436 --> 01:31:19.100]  The concept of tax avoidance is... First of all, let's go back a minute.
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:19.320]  Hold on.
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:23.724]  We're already being dominated by weird word creations that mean nothing.
[01:31:24.044 --> 01:31:25.105]  Tax avoidance.
[01:31:25.125 --> 01:31:26.106]  What does that even mean?
[01:31:26.366 --> 01:31:29.208]  So you're not going to go ahead and just pay as much tax as possible?
[01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:31.230]  You're practicing tax avoidance.
[01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:34.213]  It's like if you went to a store and they were like,
[01:31:34.893 --> 01:31:38.596]  Okay, just letting you know, we haggle on all the prices here, you can make an auction.
[01:31:39.236 --> 01:31:44.560]  If it said auction starts at $10 or pay $100,000 right now, you're avoiding $100,000.
[01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:47.702]  So you're practicing avoidance of paying $100,000.
[01:31:47.742 --> 01:32:02.612]  Well, if I have to pay 43% tax, and my accountant tells me, which is actually real life, and says, okay, well actually, you know, we classify things like this, totally legal, totally real, you know, you have things here, you want to write off as much as possible of legitimate business expense.
[01:32:03.653 --> 01:32:04.714]  Oh my gosh!
[01:32:04.754 --> 01:32:09.136]  You want to not pay as much possible tax, like, the absolute maximum amount of tax?
[01:32:09.496 --> 01:32:10.896]  You're avoiding taxes.
[01:32:11.157 --> 01:32:19.100]  But you see, to most people, unfortunately, that listen to this and believe in this kind of stuff, which is, I think, a small portion of people, they think, tax avoidance?
[01:32:19.801 --> 01:32:22.942]  It sounds similar to tax evasion, but it's very, very different.
[01:32:23.002 --> 01:32:24.103]  Just like you're not going to pay a $100,000 price tag.
[01:32:25.219 --> 01:32:25.439]  Right.
[01:32:25.619 --> 01:32:28.341]  It's just a little wordplay to kind of paint Trump as this bad guy.
[01:32:28.722 --> 01:32:36.448]  Meanwhile, they don't point out that he's paid, you know, employment taxes, all sorts of other payroll taxes, state.
[01:32:36.688 --> 01:32:38.329]  It's just, it's ridiculous.
[01:32:38.570 --> 01:32:48.017]  And the fact is, as a businessman, he has that duty to his shareholders, to his family, to not pay any more in taxes than he has.
[01:32:48.197 --> 01:32:52.218]  And look, I'm not going to sit here and say Trump's awesome and never done anything wrong.
[01:32:52.258 --> 01:32:52.558]  Who knows?
[01:32:53.258 --> 01:32:54.199]  I'm not going to even defend Trump.
[01:32:54.239 --> 01:32:56.059]  I'm going to say the system's screwed up.
[01:32:56.919 --> 01:33:12.964]  If in the first place that I have to pay 40 plus percent tax to go to a federal reserve system that is completely bloated and screwed up and just siphoning off all the money to do things like snab California mothers selling ceviche, which is what we talked about earlier.
[01:33:14.284 --> 01:33:22.112]  A year plus long sting operation on mothers on a Facebook group selling rice, cakes, and ceviche.
[01:33:22.152 --> 01:33:22.853]  Think about that.
[01:33:23.113 --> 01:33:26.437]  A year long sting operation for ceviche.
[01:33:26.757 --> 01:33:30.161]  We get seven days for 650,000 emails.
[01:33:30.221 --> 01:33:31.462]  Yeah.
[01:33:31.722 --> 01:33:31.942]  Right.
[01:33:32.022 --> 01:33:33.364]  A sting operation for ceviche though.
[01:33:33.544 --> 01:33:34.365]  She'd go to jail.
[01:33:34.585 --> 01:33:35.146]  She'd go to jail.
[01:33:35.927 --> 01:33:37.148]  Think about how much money that costs.
[01:33:37.328 --> 01:33:41.133]  So do I really want to pay all the money I have to go and pay taxes?
[01:33:42.534 --> 01:33:43.596]  They're not fixing the roads.
[01:33:43.676 --> 01:33:45.638]  It doesn't go to fixing the roads.
[01:33:45.698 --> 01:33:48.101]  It goes to corrupt pieces of junk.
[01:33:48.161 --> 01:33:50.744]  Taking down moms, which her neighbors probably fired around.
[01:33:50.764 --> 01:33:51.805]  Ending the ceviche crisis.
[01:33:52.686 --> 01:33:55.968]  We need to save the shrimps that are being used.
[01:33:56.088 --> 01:34:06.054]  But beyond all that, I guess the main point that I'm failing to actually properly hit is that not only is it absurd in the first place, but we had to hit that because it's absurd, the wording is ridiculous.
[01:34:06.415 --> 01:34:12.939]  But then, to absolutely go after him for all that when she's doing it herself and Bill did it in the first place.
[01:34:13.379 --> 01:34:20.703]  Yeah, and that's why he pointed out in the debate, he's like, well you've been there 30 years in politics, why didn't you fix these laws that you claim that you hate so much?
[01:34:20.763 --> 01:34:26.006]  And she doesn't, because it's all of her billionaire friends that take advantage of these tax loopholes.
[01:34:26.346 --> 01:34:29.707]  They don't want her to do away with the loopholes that they take advantage of.
[01:34:29.727 --> 01:34:34.290]  They purposely make it sticky so that you have to then pay some tax attorney to
[01:34:34.770 --> 01:34:40.993]  They were just showing General Flynn's tweet talking about the 650,000 emails.
[01:34:41.773 --> 01:35:03.944]  If you actually go to WikiLeaks right now, you can see a six-part series tweet that WikiLeaks, Assange, whoever, compiled breaking down the amount of time, the manpower, how much it would cost to go through that, how long it takes them with their operation, how many people it would take to do this, and how it's an impossibility for them to have come to the conclusion, to have gone through all those emails in that short amount of time.
[01:35:04.144 --> 01:35:06.325]  Yeah, he said on there it would be about an email a second.
[01:35:06.466 --> 01:35:08.027]  Yeah, and Edward Snowden... Sounds reasonable.
[01:35:08.207 --> 01:35:11.709]  Edward Snowden... Sounds like a... Some lady goes, haven't you heard of technology?
[01:35:11.729 --> 01:35:13.370]  Like... Well, that's what Edward Snowden would say now.
[01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:15.411]  Because technology can tell the difference between wrong and right.
[01:35:15.972 --> 01:35:16.872]  An AI robot.
[01:35:17.673 --> 01:35:18.613]  That would be worse, actually.
[01:35:18.633 --> 01:35:20.895]  We're entrusting an AI robot to determine what's illegal.
[01:35:21.035 --> 01:35:21.476]  Pretty much.
[01:35:21.556 --> 01:35:24.319]  Well, Edward Snowden tweeted out, you know, this is how you would do it.
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:28.044]  You would say, hide CC, this and that, so that you could find any duplicates.
[01:35:28.505 --> 01:35:33.211]  But they spent a year and a half combing through 55,000 emails and seven days with these 650,000.
[01:35:36.696 --> 01:35:38.816]  So, they were all duplicates somehow?
[01:35:38.897 --> 01:35:40.037]  I mean, how does that happen?
[01:35:40.117 --> 01:35:41.797]  You've just continually sent it to yourself?
[01:35:41.857 --> 01:35:47.878]  Well, you know, you're actually upsetting me because the problem is that you're using reason and logic to comb through something that doesn't make any sense.
[01:35:47.958 --> 01:35:49.239]  I have some breaking news, too.
[01:35:49.279 --> 01:35:55.180]  Hillary Clinton is leading in key battle states right now with China, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Qatar.
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:58.941]  So everyone right now, there's a good chance she's winning those key battleground states right now.
[01:35:59.261 --> 01:36:02.722]  But she's losing 50 key battleground United States right now, I believe.
[01:36:02.742 --> 01:36:03.722]  I'm glad you mentioned that.
[01:36:04.122 --> 01:36:05.263]  Because I have an article here.
[01:36:05.703 --> 01:36:06.844]  You know, I love Saudi Arabia.
[01:36:07.725 --> 01:36:08.265]  It's my favorite.
[01:36:08.285 --> 01:36:10.828]  I mean, hey, I like to see my women covered up and beaten in the street.
[01:36:10.848 --> 01:36:11.808]  You know, that's just the way to go.
[01:36:11.828 --> 01:36:16.712]  Look, you know, people throw around terms like sexist and obviously racist.
[01:36:16.752 --> 01:36:17.273]  Are you this one?
[01:36:17.653 --> 01:36:18.674]  I was going to talk about that one.
[01:36:19.114 --> 01:36:20.275]  Nope, I have that too.
[01:36:20.295 --> 01:36:20.996]  We talked about that.
[01:36:21.056 --> 01:36:27.201]  The woman went to prison because she dared to say that men with beards aren't like amazing clerics of Islam or whatever.
[01:36:27.401 --> 01:36:35.567]  There's an article that I printed somewhere, somewhere in there, but they, Saudi Arabia, you know, head of the, one of the heads of the Human Rights Council in the United Nations.
[01:36:35.827 --> 01:36:40.570]  Russia was removed from the Human Rights Commission, whatever it is, and Saudi Arabia was added again.
[01:36:40.591 --> 01:36:43.553]  They've been over and over again promoted as the heads of it.
[01:36:44.113 --> 01:36:51.539]  And they were asked, they were, some, a reporter I had, it's a great article, they said, well what do you think about letting women drive?
[01:36:51.559 --> 01:36:53.280]  Do you think that's something you'll ever consider?
[01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:55.822]  And they were like, no way!
[01:36:55.882 --> 01:36:57.483]  Like, no, absolutely not!
[01:36:57.523 --> 01:37:00.025]  Like that, that, you might as well... Well it says it would make them barren if they drive.
[01:37:00.145 --> 01:37:01.106]  Well you might, yeah.
[01:37:01.387 --> 01:37:10.039]  They actually tell women in Saudi Arabia that if you drive a car, you basically will never have sex again and you won't be able to have children.
[01:37:10.079 --> 01:37:11.501]  It'll drive like the desert.
[01:37:11.601 --> 01:37:14.184]  Tell that to all these moms with the SUVs driving around their six kids.
[01:37:14.605 --> 01:37:17.289]  Clearly it's not, I mean, science just proved it.
[01:37:17.589 --> 01:37:22.453]  And also, if you talk to a man you're not related to, you get like your arm chopped off or you get like lash and stuff.
[01:37:22.673 --> 01:37:36.803]  In some provinces of Saudi Arabia, like the really rich ones, some women can drive sometimes under certain regulations and rules, but they're not allowed to talk to men that aren't related to them, they're not allowed to speak their mind, they're not allowed to say anything, or they could go to prison or be lashed forever.
[01:37:37.503 --> 01:37:39.505]  So, yeah, there's a great post about it there.
[01:37:39.885 --> 01:37:44.150]  But even some of those posts are like, well, the more liberal areas, the women are slightly allowed to drive.
[01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:48.053]  Meanwhile, meanwhile, Hillary's taking money from them.
[01:37:48.234 --> 01:37:48.414]  Right.
[01:37:48.554 --> 01:37:48.754]  Okay?
[01:37:48.794 --> 01:37:51.056]  And that doesn't mean I'm Republican for saying that.
[01:37:51.316 --> 01:37:52.618]  It means I live in reality.
[01:37:52.978 --> 01:37:54.480]  It means I have a brain, okay?
[01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:56.481]  It means I'm going through the loophole.
[01:37:57.242 --> 01:37:58.563]  Of political correctness.
[01:37:58.583 --> 01:37:59.384]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:37:59.865 --> 01:38:03.568]  And also, it means that, wow, maybe we should be upset about real stuff.
[01:38:03.588 --> 01:38:04.569]  Because that's real sexism.
[01:38:04.589 --> 01:38:07.892]  Because I actually like human empowerment, female empowerment, male empowerment, every empowerment.
[01:38:08.173 --> 01:38:10.174]  And I don't like lashing women for driving.
[01:38:10.254 --> 01:38:14.579]  Yeah, and taking money from these foreign governments when you claim to be this paragon for feminism.
[01:38:14.599 --> 01:38:15.299]  Yeah, that doesn't work.
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:16.460]  That's not real life.
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:22.426]  So you're going to tell us that millions of dollars they're giving you, they're not going to somehow influence your politics?
[01:38:22.546 --> 01:38:27.468]  If you've had leg surgery or like your ACL replaced, who's driving to the store to get your beer?
[01:38:28.028 --> 01:38:28.688]  Like, what are they doing?
[01:38:28.929 --> 01:38:29.509]  That's a struggle.
[01:38:29.989 --> 01:38:35.491]  Hey, you know, my wife, my fiance, somebody's going to the store for me and that's why we need cars.
[01:38:35.691 --> 01:38:40.393]  See, that's obviously a very gender equality statement right there.
[01:38:40.773 --> 01:38:42.154]  Well, you know what's funny though?
[01:38:43.186 --> 01:38:46.310]  I think, like, it's the absurdity.
[01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:47.571]  We can make jokes, right?
[01:38:47.591 --> 01:38:50.615]  So we can sit here and make jokes, because we actually understand how real life is.
[01:38:50.635 --> 01:38:57.623]  And that actually also, for me anyway, proves that you don't have, like, true hatred towards certain types of people, because you can joke about it, right?
[01:38:58.304 --> 01:38:59.345]  It's funny, who cares?
[01:39:00.026 --> 01:39:01.708]  It's people like Hillary that go out and say,
[01:39:02.589 --> 01:39:03.869]  You are terrible!
[01:39:04.090 --> 01:39:05.610]  You're all sexist and racist!
[01:39:05.670 --> 01:39:06.370]  Horrible people!
[01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:08.391]  And they'll be like, oh, Saudi Arabia, give me some money.
[01:39:08.451 --> 01:39:09.051]  Like, oh, sure.
[01:39:09.591 --> 01:39:11.252]  No women driving or whatever like that.
[01:39:11.452 --> 01:39:14.813]  Also, some of the other countries, it's just so over the top.
[01:39:15.093 --> 01:39:24.036]  It's only when it's over the top can someone, a politician, it's like Frank Underwood on steroids from House of Cards, go on stage and be like, oh, I was so sad.
[01:39:24.136 --> 01:39:28.097]  Like Joe Biden crying and then like weirdly smelling little
[01:39:28.117 --> 01:39:28.317]  That's
[01:39:51.937 --> 01:39:59.242]  Most of the population gets a certain allowance so everything they have from the day they're born essentially is taken care of, guaranteed to them.
[01:39:59.262 --> 01:40:02.825]  They're going to get a house, they're going to get a car, everything is taken care of them.
[01:40:02.965 --> 01:40:12.672]  So they're not going to fight against the system because that's the whole thing with the welfare state is that of course you want to vote this welfare state in but you're never going to
[01:40:13.433 --> 01:40:14.114]  We're good to go.
[01:40:35.188 --> 01:40:36.689]  This is the 52 hour marathon.
[01:40:36.749 --> 01:40:37.650]  I mean, it's going to be insane.
[01:40:37.690 --> 01:40:38.531]  It's already crazy.
[01:40:38.551 --> 01:40:40.252]  We're like 7, 8 hours into it now.
[01:40:40.632 --> 01:40:41.893]  This is kind of the tip of the iceberg.
[01:40:41.913 --> 01:40:43.835]  Well, we started with 11, right?
[01:40:44.915 --> 01:40:45.196]  So yeah.
[01:40:45.216 --> 01:40:47.497]  It's going 52 hours until Wednesday at 3pm.
[01:40:48.178 --> 01:40:49.079]  It's going to be a long journey.
[01:40:49.119 --> 01:41:01.408]  I'm going to be interviewing Dr. Group here shortly for a video we'll air later on, but we're going to be talking about election fatigue and some of the things people can do because I'm telling you, it's not going to end after the voting boom.
[01:41:01.408 --> 01:41:07.651]  No, that's all a facade because the election is just kind of like bringing out all the problems.
[01:41:07.711 --> 01:41:15.094]  It's like if you have really bad skin and you use an exfoliant or something and you start breaking out, that gunk was there in the first place.
[01:41:15.114 --> 01:41:16.615]  It's not like, oh, it caused acne!
[01:41:16.655 --> 01:41:25.619]  You see, the election just pulled all of the gunk in our society's mucous membrane out and now it's starting to have hives all over it.
[01:41:25.639 --> 01:41:26.360]  That's why I grew a beard.
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:40.689]  What it is for me is that's making me so frustrated is just the massive psyop that's going on and like feeling like you're banging your head into a brick wall trying to speak to certain people and to just kind of see you know here here
[01:41:42.159 --> 01:41:42.900]  We're good to go.
[01:41:58.277 --> 01:41:58.437]  I don't
[01:42:21.198 --> 01:42:21.358]  I don't
[01:42:36.535 --> 01:42:42.517]  There are 20-30,000 people that go and just wait in lines miles long from different countries that come out to go see this guy talk.
[01:42:42.797 --> 01:42:45.018]  But then you turn on the TV and it's just like they're just hitting you in the head.
[01:42:45.038 --> 01:42:48.860]  It's like that game at the fair where you're hitting all the frogs or whatever, the little hippies or whatever.
[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:50.900]  And you're just getting knocked down the whole time.
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:52.181]  But you're like, you know we have it.
[01:42:52.221 --> 01:42:54.422]  So the psy-op is just crazy.
[01:42:54.462 --> 01:42:55.382]  Like he gets to me sometimes.
[01:42:55.402 --> 01:43:00.624]  Like this weekend, I had to pull away and like submerge myself into a video game for like 12 hours yesterday.
[01:43:00.664 --> 01:43:01.644]  I played the new Call of Duty.
[01:43:01.784 --> 01:43:03.185]  You have elective stress disorder.
[01:43:03.305 --> 01:43:14.580]  Yeah, I just had to take my mind out of it for a minute because it's like, alright, I know we're up, I know there's a great chance we're gonna win, and I'm just sick and tired of hearing them tell me I'm... At the same time though, the root problem, right?
[01:43:15.061 --> 01:43:15.361]  We.
[01:43:15.601 --> 01:43:16.162]  What is we?
[01:43:16.542 --> 01:43:17.504]  What does that even mean, right?
[01:43:17.864 --> 01:43:18.685]  They've succeeded in
[01:43:19.266 --> 01:43:26.352]  Putting us and pinning us against each other, because a divided population is the only population that can be controlled, through whatever means that is.
[01:43:26.372 --> 01:43:29.795]  It doesn't mean you're going to have a wire plugged into your brain and controlled.
[01:43:29.835 --> 01:43:36.341]  It just means that it's truly, like I just said earlier, free-thinking populations and free-thinking people can't be controlled.
[01:43:36.361 --> 01:43:36.802]  They're wild.
[01:43:37.182 --> 01:43:43.488]  Unpredictability is the biggest threat to all forms of control, all forms of profit, everything.
[01:43:44.108 --> 01:43:48.912]  Down to the reason for AI technology for restaurants is because predictability.
[01:43:49.112 --> 01:43:55.858]  They need to prepare the fries the same every time, they need to prepare the burgers the same every time, they need to have the exact same outcome every single time.
[01:43:56.238 --> 01:43:59.901]  Or else the algorithms of what will make the most money and all that don't work.
[01:44:00.221 --> 01:44:02.323]  Well, people are also the same.
[01:44:02.723 --> 01:44:09.509]  And if you have people that are easily pitted up against each other, this has been the thing forever, okay?
[01:44:09.969 --> 01:44:11.631]  Left-right paradigm over and over and over again.
[01:44:11.931 --> 01:44:15.515]  It's literally just saying, this group believes this, this group believes that.
[01:44:16.035 --> 01:44:17.236]  No, fight each other.
[01:44:17.256 --> 01:44:17.957]  Yeah, fight each other.
[01:44:17.997 --> 01:44:19.839]  It's like, you guys all hate each other.
[01:44:20.139 --> 01:44:22.522]  See, it's because this person was black that the cop did that.
[01:44:22.882 --> 01:44:24.504]  See, it's because of that.
[01:44:24.584 --> 01:44:30.309]  And then it's like, oh, well, this person over here is different in this way, so you need to all hate each other.
[01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:38.553]  Just like in preschool or kindergarten, they show kids pictures of black and white people, like, this person's black!
[01:44:38.593 --> 01:44:39.974]  And the kid's like, I don't understand.
[01:44:40.374 --> 01:44:40.754]  Who cares?
[01:44:40.774 --> 01:44:41.354]  This is my friend.
[01:44:41.374 --> 01:44:42.034]  I don't care if he's black.
[01:44:42.054 --> 01:44:42.955]  They're like, but he's black!
[01:44:43.295 --> 01:44:44.115]  You must accept him!
[01:44:44.135 --> 01:44:44.836]  He's like, I do.
[01:44:44.876 --> 01:44:45.456]  He's my buddy.
[01:44:45.476 --> 01:44:46.176]  He's like my best friend.
[01:44:46.196 --> 01:44:46.556]  They're like, no!
[01:44:46.576 --> 01:44:47.917]  They're black every day after school.
[01:44:47.977 --> 01:44:48.197]  Right?
[01:44:48.557 --> 01:44:53.759]  So it's pushed in our heads that this thing that divides us all, and we all hate each other.
[01:44:53.779 --> 01:44:58.141]  Yeah, they point out the differences and then demand that you see everything equally.
[01:44:58.181 --> 01:44:59.421]  See how it's reinforced, though.
[01:44:59.481 --> 01:45:00.362]  Because if you said,
[01:45:00.962 --> 01:45:09.367]  Wow, Hillary Clinton takes money from Saudi Arabia, which dismembers women, and lashes them, and kills them, and does all these horrible things, and is actually really, really terrible.
[01:45:09.387 --> 01:45:09.788]  Murders gay people.
[01:45:10.168 --> 01:45:10.888]  Murders gay people?
[01:45:10.928 --> 01:45:11.649]  Murders everybody!
[01:45:11.709 --> 01:45:14.030]  I mean, you can just put a tweet out, and they'll kill you.
[01:45:14.050 --> 01:45:14.531]  Okay?
[01:45:14.771 --> 01:45:17.032]  But if you say that, and they say, oh, you don't like, you must like Trump.
[01:45:17.392 --> 01:45:18.013]  You hate Hillary.
[01:45:18.493 --> 01:45:20.095]  It's like, whoa, what are you doing?
[01:45:20.135 --> 01:45:21.777]  You're totally warping what I said.
[01:45:21.857 --> 01:45:24.960]  I can't just make a real-life statement because it's faction-oriented.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.142]  They know we are tribal.
[01:45:26.302 --> 01:45:27.764]  Human beings are very, very tribal.
[01:45:27.804 --> 01:45:32.769]  I mean, if you think about it, we're basically conditioned to live in a tribe of a hundred people, okay, or a thousand people.
[01:45:33.070 --> 01:45:36.293]  So we have to fight each other, just like football teams, you like kill each other.
[01:45:36.333 --> 01:45:37.395]  Like, my team won.
[01:45:38.035 --> 01:45:39.377]  Your team didn't win anything.
[01:45:40.158 --> 01:45:41.319]  You didn't win a damn thing.
[01:45:41.339 --> 01:45:46.944]  A bunch of people from all over the country, they pay a bunch of money to be on one team and wear a bunch of colors, a bunch of pink, red and blue or whatever.
[01:45:47.264 --> 01:45:47.725]  They won.
[01:45:47.745 --> 01:45:49.086]  Those people won.
[01:45:49.106 --> 01:45:49.566]  Okay?
[01:45:49.967 --> 01:45:51.809]  I don't care if you like football or whatever, but no.
[01:45:52.189 --> 01:45:55.132]  It's like pinning us up against each other is the only thing they've got now.
[01:45:55.212 --> 01:45:55.832]  It's a shame.
[01:45:55.892 --> 01:45:56.493]  It's a true shame.
[01:45:56.533 --> 01:46:04.635]  And also, too, you see historically they'll pick certain groups that are sort of the victim class and they'll say, you know, in the past it has been African-Americans.
[01:46:04.655 --> 01:46:05.996]  All of your problems are these people.
[01:46:06.016 --> 01:46:06.956]  You're the victims.
[01:46:07.096 --> 01:46:08.016]  We're going to help you.
[01:46:08.196 --> 01:46:10.497]  So now, this time around, it's starting to be women.
[01:46:11.377 --> 01:46:12.898]  So women are starting to have the rise.
[01:46:12.958 --> 01:46:17.379]  And then, of course, undocumented, the illegal immigrants that are here.
[01:46:17.739 --> 01:46:19.201]  And so it's pitting those peeps.
[01:46:19.241 --> 01:46:25.749]  They're the new pet group that they're gonna solve all of your problems this time around as long as you just vote Democratic.
[01:46:26.650 --> 01:46:29.673]  And then the other groups are no longer in vogue.
[01:46:33.298 --> 01:46:36.160]  It pissed me off so bad to like the 10th degree.
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:39.282]  Oh, it's okay for an illegal immigrant to be able to go vote.
[01:46:39.523 --> 01:46:48.230]  Yeah, my brothers and sisters joined the military to fight for America, to fight for the American values, to protect our way of life, how we do it, so illegals can go.
[01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:51.451]  No, I'm sorry, that's not how the hell it is.
[01:46:51.791 --> 01:46:57.914]  We fought for American citizens to be able to uphold that democratic process, for us to be able to go out and do that.
[01:46:58.194 --> 01:47:00.595]  Not for someone in another country to be able to go do it.
[01:47:00.796 --> 01:47:03.877]  Because I sure as hell can't go to Germany, live there illegally, and vote.
[01:47:03.957 --> 01:47:06.018]  I can't go to Mexico, live there illegally, and vote.
[01:47:06.198 --> 01:47:06.678]  And guess what?
[01:47:06.778 --> 01:47:07.539]  Legal immigrants-
[01:47:08.599 --> 01:47:10.720]  Who are some of the best people I've ever met in my entire life?
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:13.561]  Legal immigrants hate that too.
[01:47:13.801 --> 01:47:14.661]  They hate it more than you do.
[01:47:15.041 --> 01:47:16.062]  They hate it so much more.
[01:47:16.282 --> 01:47:18.402]  Because they had to go through the process to actually get it done.
[01:47:18.542 --> 01:47:20.683]  That's why so many legal immigrants actually love Trump.
[01:47:20.723 --> 01:47:21.443]  And people are like, what?
[01:47:21.463 --> 01:47:22.244]  That doesn't make sense.
[01:47:22.624 --> 01:47:24.184]  Because they know what they had to do.
[01:47:24.425 --> 01:47:25.725]  And when you just open it up...
[01:47:25.865 --> 01:47:28.647]  Well, they know how great this country is, and they worked hard to get here.
[01:47:28.867 --> 01:47:33.271]  Some women actually know the history a lot better than actual American-born citizens.
[01:47:33.331 --> 01:47:35.733]  The tests that you have to take are actually pretty strenuous.
[01:47:35.933 --> 01:47:38.455]  I couldn't even answer a lot of the questions in there.
[01:47:38.815 --> 01:47:41.037]  Well, you get denied entry into the country.
[01:47:41.057 --> 01:47:41.357]  Sorry!
[01:47:41.657 --> 01:47:42.918]  Just lucky I was born here.
[01:47:42.938 --> 01:47:43.859]  You're just lucky you were born here.
[01:47:44.139 --> 01:47:51.824]  Alright, so we're going to go ahead and play a couple of these videos, then we're going to go to break, because I know Alex wanted to play his videos and we've been trying to get them queued up.
[01:47:52.005 --> 01:47:53.946]  So we're going to go ahead and talk about this first of all.
[01:47:54.806 --> 01:47:57.008]  This is an example of unpredictability.
[01:47:57.048 --> 01:48:02.272]  This is like, oh no, a glitch in the system, oh my god, reactivate the drones, like...
[01:48:03.092 --> 01:48:09.377]  Anything where they actually say something on the media, whether or not it's even true, just a disruption, is unacceptable.
[01:48:09.417 --> 01:48:14.040]  So we're going to play Conway Explodes on Jake Tapper accuses CNN of saying race is over.
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:14.701]  Let's go ahead and play that.
[01:48:17.443 --> 01:48:18.143]  If we got to cue it up.
[01:48:19.184 --> 01:48:19.925]  If not, that's fine too.
[01:48:21.499 --> 01:48:21.799]  Not yet?
[01:48:21.859 --> 01:48:22.219]  Okay, cool.
[01:48:22.239 --> 01:48:23.120]  We got a minute on that one.
[01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:29.504]  We're also going to talk about, so the Trump attacker, the apparent attacker, you know, the guy they thought had a gun or whatever.
[01:48:29.524 --> 01:48:30.345]  Right.
[01:48:30.645 --> 01:48:31.545]  You know, going against him.
[01:48:31.925 --> 01:48:36.728]  He's apparently been using his dead grandmother's address to vote.
[01:48:37.469 --> 01:48:39.110]  And he's going to use it to vote for Hillary.
[01:48:39.130 --> 01:48:40.151]  Voter fraud, is it real?
[01:48:40.231 --> 01:48:41.391]  But voter fraud is not real.
[01:48:41.411 --> 01:48:42.172]  So let's play that one too.
[01:48:42.192 --> 01:48:43.192]  Obama doesn't know what that even means.
[01:48:43.212 --> 01:48:48.116]  This is about the Trump alleged attacker that he's using his dead grandma to vote.
[01:48:48.136 --> 01:48:48.536]  Let's play that.
[01:48:49.352 --> 01:48:52.835]  Democrats would love for you to believe that voter fraud does not exist.
[01:48:52.935 --> 01:48:54.957]  Better chance of getting hit by lightning, they always say.
[01:48:55.317 --> 01:49:01.222]  But this morning, yet another reminder from the guy who interrupted Donald Trump's rally on Saturday, who many thought had a gun.
[01:49:01.682 --> 01:49:05.345]  And his name is Austin Kreitz, or Kreitz, if you're trying to keep up with him.
[01:49:05.685 --> 01:49:09.749]  He claimed he was a Republican, but it turns out he's a huge Hillary supporter.
[01:49:10.089 --> 01:49:14.953]  And his grandmother has been using this address to vote absentee for years.
[01:49:15.013 --> 01:49:16.654]  His address to vote absentee for years?
[01:49:17.395 --> 01:49:18.416]  But she's been dead since 2002.
[01:49:18.836 --> 01:49:21.358]  Although I miss her, I don't think she should be voted.
[01:49:21.778 --> 01:49:26.082]  Here with more on this growing problem is a former DOJ employee, Jay Christian Adams.
[01:49:26.102 --> 01:49:28.403]  Christian, this has to surprise you, right?
[01:49:28.423 --> 01:49:29.704]  Yeah, I'm shocked.
[01:49:29.784 --> 01:49:31.706]  Brian, this is going on all over the country.
[01:49:32.126 --> 01:49:37.030]  It's a federal felony, and of course it will not be prosecuted by this Justice Department.
[01:49:37.690 --> 01:49:40.913]  They don't prosecute voter fraud for the same reason they don't prosecute Hillary.
[01:49:41.293 --> 01:49:43.675]  Because it's all political at this Justice Department.
[01:49:44.135 --> 01:49:46.717]  They know about voter fraud and do nothing about it.
[01:49:47.077 --> 01:49:49.839]  And to me, if you want- Oh, there it is.
[01:49:50.139 --> 01:49:53.101]  So he's been using his dead grandmother's address to do absentee voting.
[01:49:53.442 --> 01:49:54.803]  But voter fraud doesn't exist.
[01:49:54.923 --> 01:49:55.783]  Voter fraud doesn't exist.
[01:49:55.863 --> 01:49:58.325]  I haven't seen this one yet, but it's supposed to be good as well.
[01:49:58.525 --> 01:49:59.206]  Think about this guy.
[01:49:59.246 --> 01:50:03.189]  He went into a Trump rally, caused a ruckus, and he left unharmed.
[01:50:04.261 --> 01:50:04.541]  I don't
[01:50:34.281 --> 01:50:35.342]  Because of his dead grandmother.
[01:50:35.362 --> 01:50:39.046]  Let's play this one and then we'll go to break if that's alright with you guys.
[01:50:39.066 --> 01:50:40.307]  We're going to play this video.
[01:50:40.627 --> 01:50:43.309]  Worst cases of voter fraud reported in Battleground State.
[01:50:43.530 --> 01:50:44.450]  This is from Fox again.
[01:50:44.491 --> 01:50:44.991]  Let's check it out.
[01:50:46.652 --> 01:50:49.895]  So let's just get to some of these cases because this has already proven to be a real thing.
[01:50:49.936 --> 01:50:55.200]  For example, in California, a man finds dozens, 83 ballots in someone's home.
[01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:56.882]  So apparently 83 people live in one home.
[01:50:57.532 --> 01:51:00.694]  Yeah, well, Jerry Mosner, he was out gardening his house.
[01:51:01.154 --> 01:51:04.277]  He had an elderly neighbor who lived in a small little home.
[01:51:04.477 --> 01:51:06.918]  Noticed that she had a lot of mail that day, so went to pick it up.
[01:51:07.219 --> 01:51:09.580]  Found 83 ballots.
[01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:10.501]  Unreal.
[01:51:10.521 --> 01:51:13.143]  And she's just an old woman living in this house.
[01:51:13.223 --> 01:51:15.644]  So they went to actually the LAPD to report this.
[01:51:16.185 --> 01:51:18.106]  And the LAPD kind of shrugged their shoulders.
[01:51:18.126 --> 01:51:19.607]  They said, I'll go to the post office.
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:22.601]  The post office was like, eh, we don't know what happened.
[01:51:22.961 --> 01:51:26.562]  Eventually another neighbor went to the registrar's office and they're now investigating this.
[01:51:27.002 --> 01:51:32.804]  But it didn't seem too concerned there in California that 83 people were living in this small house all registered to vote.
[01:51:32.824 --> 01:51:33.965]  Well, and that's California.
[01:51:34.025 --> 01:51:38.766]  Here's where it could get serious in a state like Florida, where the polls are neck and neck for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
[01:51:38.786 --> 01:51:40.867]  In Florida, they busted two women.
[01:51:41.687 --> 01:51:42.167]  Two women!
[01:51:42.427 --> 01:51:53.332]  Two women on third-degree felonies for voter fraud because the first woman was out canvassing, or she was supposed to be out canvassing, for United People for medical marijuana, out getting voter registrations.
[01:51:53.352 --> 01:51:58.655]  Well, apparently knocking on door-to-door was too difficult for her, so she just made up names.
[01:51:58.695 --> 01:52:08.219]  She put some dead people, she registered some dead people, she just made up falsified information, sent it all in, and the registrar caught her for falsifying all this information.
[01:52:08.659 --> 01:52:14.724]  Another woman was actually working in the Miami-Dade Elections Department, she was a volunteer, opening up mail-in ballots.
[01:52:15.205 --> 01:52:23.652]  When she noticed that some people didn't vote all the way down the ballot for the mayor, she started checking boxes for them, for her favorite candidate, and was caught doing that.
[01:52:24.072 --> 01:52:27.515]  And these are just the ones that have been caught, it makes you wonder how many others are out there.
[01:52:27.795 --> 01:52:31.358]  So also in California, more switches of voter registration there.
[01:52:31.378 --> 01:52:33.720]  But voter fraud doesn't exist.
[01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:35.562]  Yeah, no, gaslighting, it's not real.
[01:52:36.394 --> 01:52:36.915]  No, it's not.
[01:52:52.108 --> 01:52:55.109]  A ton of cyber security experts, people that really know what they're talking about.
[01:52:55.469 --> 01:52:57.790]  I hate that term too, cyber security.
[01:52:58.070 --> 01:53:00.030]  How about people that know how life works?
[01:53:00.750 --> 01:53:01.171]  Okay?
[01:53:01.771 --> 01:53:04.431]  Can tell you that the voting machines, well guess what?
[01:53:04.471 --> 01:53:07.032]  Everything has backend access, whether we want to accept it or not.
[01:53:07.212 --> 01:53:10.333]  Every single thing, including this phone right here, has mega backend access.
[01:53:10.793 --> 01:53:16.395]  And with the right parties making the right agreements and doing the right things, anything can be messed with.
[01:53:16.595 --> 01:53:17.135]  Impossible.
[01:53:17.475 --> 01:53:19.697]  Only the Russians can do the hacking of the election.
[01:53:19.717 --> 01:53:21.598]  Now, here's what I would challenge people, okay?
[01:53:22.059 --> 01:53:22.739]  Think about it like this.
[01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:31.747]  If everyone was totally for Trump and they hated Hillary, oh wait, it kind of sounds like what it's really like, but let's say the media was admitting that.
[01:53:32.087 --> 01:53:36.270]  Would Hillary's people then say, well, he's going to use voter fraud against us?
[01:53:36.631 --> 01:53:37.131]  Yeah, of course.
[01:53:37.551 --> 01:53:42.355]  See, it's the whole pitting against each other, like, well, they're on the other side, so it's impossible now.
[01:53:42.375 --> 01:53:42.776]  Right.
[01:53:42.976 --> 01:53:44.697]  But let's go back to George W. Bush.
[01:53:44.717 --> 01:53:45.418]  Right, with Al Gore.
[01:53:45.438 --> 01:53:46.679]  It was not impossible then.
[01:53:47.139 --> 01:53:48.380]  That wasn't impossible, was it?
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:49.460]  They demanded a major recount.
[01:53:49.540 --> 01:53:51.341]  I mean, they dragged that out.
[01:53:51.381 --> 01:53:53.102]  But then guess what they keep saying over and over again?
[01:53:53.222 --> 01:53:57.503]  If Trump doesn't accept his loss, it'll be disgraceful.
[01:53:57.543 --> 01:53:59.664]  He's a horrible person, a conspiracy theorist.
[01:54:00.044 --> 01:54:01.765]  But Al Gore is holy.
[01:54:02.105 --> 01:54:03.866]  May I touch the hem of his robe?
[01:54:04.226 --> 01:54:07.988]  Did you know touching the hem of Al Gore's robe reduces CO2 emissions?
[01:54:08.348 --> 01:54:09.729]  It seems like it.
[01:54:09.769 --> 01:54:09.929]  No.
[01:54:10.129 --> 01:54:14.130]  If you worship him, if you get down on your knees and worship Al Gore, it reduces your CO2 emissions.
[01:54:14.811 --> 01:54:15.311]  It's been proven.
[01:54:15.811 --> 01:54:19.594]  I could just kill myself as well.
[01:54:19.614 --> 01:54:23.857]  The point is that it's whatever people want to fit their narrative.
[01:54:24.338 --> 01:54:24.698]  Period.
[01:54:24.878 --> 01:54:26.739]  That's how it all works.
[01:54:26.779 --> 01:54:31.203]  And that's what's so scary about it is that a lot of people don't even have their own narrative.
[01:54:31.243 --> 01:54:37.628]  They just listen to whatever the media tells them or what their friends are sharing on Facebook, which we've already seen how Facebook, Google,
[01:54:38.468 --> 01:54:41.789]  They're tweaking the algorithms to be the kind of news that they want out there.
[01:54:41.809 --> 01:54:47.551]  Google's actually helping Eric Schmidt set up a whole company to help Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[01:54:47.951 --> 01:55:01.256]  So you're getting all this filtered information that is what the establishment wants you to think all of your friends are voting for and this is what's normal and right and real because the mainstream media is telling you when they have completely corrupted the fourth estate.
[01:55:01.556 --> 01:55:02.316]  And it's like, you know what?
[01:55:02.876 --> 01:55:06.098]  I think overall, I would love to embrace Google.
[01:55:07.798 --> 01:55:13.880]  By the way, I know that sounds authoritarian and crazy, but the idea that, okay, a lot of the stuff is actually good.
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:15.341]  There is a lot of fake news on Facebook.
[01:55:15.361 --> 01:55:17.061]  Do you know how much fake news is on Facebook?
[01:55:17.602 --> 01:55:26.565]  So sure, something does need to be done about the junk on Facebook, because people also make real sounding things, like the Daily Star Gazette
[01:55:27.205 --> 01:55:27.846]  Chicago.
[01:55:27.886 --> 01:55:29.227]  And it's like, oh, this sounds legit.
[01:55:29.247 --> 01:55:31.208]  It has like a nice logo that someone made in Photoshop.
[01:55:31.228 --> 01:55:36.072]  And it's like, you know, Donald Trump is dead, you know, and it gets 50,000 shares or whatever.
[01:55:36.412 --> 01:55:37.673]  So I understand the premises of it.
[01:55:37.913 --> 01:55:45.258]  But the issue becomes when it's not about cracking down on that fake news, it's about, oh, well, any dissenting opinion is fake, right?
[01:55:45.338 --> 01:55:46.259]  That's what it turns into.
[01:55:46.279 --> 01:55:46.539]  You see?
[01:55:46.579 --> 01:55:50.262]  So there's a very fine line where it actually goes from, oh, OK, it's fun to, whoa, what?
[01:55:50.542 --> 01:55:50.762]  Yeah.
[01:55:50.782 --> 01:55:52.884]  Like any dissenting opinion is fake news.
[01:55:52.944 --> 01:56:00.969]  Well, and it only credits or gives the blue checkmark to the people and the outlets that are pushing that propaganda that they want.
[01:56:01.029 --> 01:56:08.173]  I mean, it's like considered to be the... Well, I think also there's a level of outrage and insanity that happens when anything happens on Facebook.
[01:56:08.793 --> 01:56:12.676]  When you go against the EULA, the Terms of Agreement, something like that.
[01:56:12.736 --> 01:56:14.977]  I think it's also an amazing tool to reach people.
[01:56:15.317 --> 01:56:17.979]  But there's also this outrage that happens when people are like, censorship!
[01:56:18.019 --> 01:56:19.060]  Oh my God, I've been censored!
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:21.261]  It's like, actually, no, you posted like a nude photo.
[01:56:22.241 --> 01:56:23.823]  Or like, you posted someone getting beheaded.
[01:56:23.863 --> 01:56:25.384]  It's like, but they censored me!
[01:56:25.704 --> 01:56:27.105]  It's like, I can't get the blue verified check.
[01:56:27.125 --> 01:56:28.286]  Yeah, they have their terms of service.
[01:56:28.306 --> 01:56:29.947]  I mean, everyone else has a blue verified check.
[01:56:29.967 --> 01:56:30.407]  It's like, who else?
[01:56:30.427 --> 01:56:31.248]  Well, Oprah has it.
[01:56:31.508 --> 01:56:32.789]  It's like, what have you ever done?
[01:56:32.809 --> 01:56:35.290]  It's like, well, they're censoring me!
[01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:37.392]  It's like, there's a degree of that too, okay?
[01:56:37.812 --> 01:56:38.012]  Right?
[01:56:38.132 --> 01:56:43.316]  So it's, but at the same time, that's why we're always destroyed, because I always say, lack of understanding the details.
[01:56:43.536 --> 01:56:45.297]  We can both, both of those things can be right.
[01:56:45.358 --> 01:56:47.039]  There is censorship and a lot of it's BS.
[01:56:47.439 --> 01:56:48.280]  Both of those things can be right.
[01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:49.401]  It doesn't have to be one way or another.
[01:56:49.421 --> 01:56:50.942]  It doesn't have to be Republican or Democrat.
[01:56:50.962 --> 01:56:52.703]  It doesn't have to be Hillary or Donald Trump.
[01:56:52.943 --> 01:56:55.045]  You can actually believe in real things your own self.
[01:56:55.405 --> 01:56:56.546]  You can have your own beliefs.
[01:56:56.987 --> 01:56:58.488]  You can have your own understanding.
[01:56:58.508 --> 01:57:03.552]  I just don't want a corrupt system that's clearly biased setting up my truth filter for me.
[01:57:03.772 --> 01:57:04.152]  You should.
[01:57:04.513 --> 01:57:05.273]  They know what's good for you.
[01:57:05.633 --> 01:57:10.156]  Alright, so we're going to play that clip, and then we're going to go to break, and then Rob Dew is coming in to host the next hour.
[01:57:10.176 --> 01:57:13.338]  And there's a lot left in this 52-hour broadcast.
[01:57:13.758 --> 01:57:22.404]  And I will remind you, InfoWarsLife.com, 30% off all the best stuff, Supermail Vitality, Survival Shield X2, and Ace and Iodine.
[01:57:22.444 --> 01:57:24.906]  Don't know which camera it is, but Survival Shield X2 and Ace and Iodine.
[01:57:25.726 --> 01:57:32.944]  Let me just tell you, 30%, I don't think we've ever done it on Survival Shield X2, and when I looked at the price, I thought they calculated it wrong, because it's $20.
[01:57:34.968 --> 01:57:36.810]  Okay, it's basically $19.95, $20.
[01:57:37.730 --> 01:57:39.932]  There's pretty much no profit on that at all.
[01:57:40.532 --> 01:57:44.335]  So, this is really about just getting the stuff out there.
[01:57:44.535 --> 01:57:46.516]  It's really about supporting the broadcast.
[01:57:46.556 --> 01:57:50.499]  It's really about getting the super high quality stuff that works, that pretty much everyone here takes.
[01:57:50.879 --> 01:57:55.742]  People are obsessed with the brain force, survival shield, obsessed with the DNA force, which is $94, which is absurd, over the top.
[01:57:58.524 --> 01:57:59.464]  It just goes on and on.
[01:57:59.585 --> 01:58:13.131]  So if you want to make a difference, you want to actually do something with your money, don't go to Walmart and buy junk from China where they just dump chemicals into the products because they don't have any way of just getting rid of them in their own industrial ways.
[01:58:13.611 --> 01:58:15.792]  Buy something that works and support something you believe in.
[01:58:16.132 --> 01:58:17.212]  So Leanne, thank you.
[01:58:17.493 --> 01:58:18.153]  Biggs, thank you.
[01:58:18.173 --> 01:58:19.914]  Dr. Group, thank you very much.
[01:58:20.774 --> 01:58:22.115]  Sorry we didn't get to talk a little bit more.
[01:58:22.355 --> 01:58:25.377]  And now we're going to leave with this piece.
[01:58:26.038 --> 01:58:30.721]  Conway explodes on Jake Tapper, totally disrupts the whole CNN system, and then Rob Dues is going to come in.
[01:58:31.382 --> 01:58:34.164]  Thank you very much for watching 52 Hour Historic Broadcast.
[01:58:37.185 --> 01:58:38.026]  assassination attempt.
[01:58:38.066 --> 01:58:44.573]  It was apparently a local voter, a Republican, who says he is supporting Hillary Clinton.
[01:58:44.593 --> 01:58:45.974]  He has given money to Hillary Clinton.
[01:58:45.994 --> 01:58:47.395]  He has canvassed for Hillary Clinton.
[01:58:47.676 --> 01:58:48.977]  But he says he's a Republican.
[01:58:48.997 --> 01:58:52.621]  But most importantly, he was not trying to assassinate anyone.
[01:58:53.582 --> 01:58:55.184]  And here's what I'm talking about.
[01:58:55.205 --> 01:58:55.665]  Let's put it up.
[01:58:55.685 --> 01:58:56.266]  Donald Trump Jr.
[01:58:56.286 --> 01:58:57.868]  and Dan Scavino retweeted this quote.
[01:58:58.189 --> 01:58:59.711]  Hillary ran away from rain today.
[01:58:59.751 --> 01:59:02.676]  Trump is back on stage minutes after assassination attempt.
[01:59:02.796 --> 01:59:08.604]  Again, we're very happy that this was not an assassination attempt, but why is your campaign spreading that it was?
[01:59:09.892 --> 01:59:15.117]  Well, how do you... First of all, that's really remarkable, I have to say, that that's what the storyline is here.
[01:59:15.137 --> 01:59:19.020]  I thank you for reminding everybody that the rain chased her away.
[01:59:19.060 --> 01:59:23.484]  There weren't a lot of people there at her rally to begin with, and the rain just let them running for cover.
[01:59:23.504 --> 01:59:30.069]  I think she's got to sort of travel non-stop with Beyonce, Jay-Z, and the likes of that, just to prop her up and get a decent crowd.
[01:59:30.109 --> 01:59:32.331]  People, by the way, are there to see Beyonce, not to see her.
[01:59:33.372 --> 01:59:41.160]  And, you know, Jake, I want to say, is CNN going to retract all the storylines, all the headlines, all the breathless predictions of the last two weeks that it turned out not to be true?
[01:59:41.541 --> 01:59:42.261]  The race is over.
[01:59:42.281 --> 01:59:43.683]  The path is closed.
[01:59:44.043 --> 01:59:45.164]  It's going to be a blowout.
[01:59:45.485 --> 01:59:48.828]  You guys retract that, and I'll give a call to Dan Scavino about the retweet.
[01:59:50.009 --> 01:59:51.691]  I never reported anything along those lines.
[01:59:51.731 --> 01:59:53.793]  I've always been saying that this was going to be a tight election.
[01:59:53.813 --> 01:59:54.234]  CNN certainly has.
[01:59:54.274 --> 01:59:56.356]  Even when Hillary... Who hasn't?
[01:59:56.829 --> 01:59:57.750]  CNN certainly has.
[01:59:57.790 --> 01:59:58.670]  CNN certainly has.
[01:59:58.810 --> 02:00:01.412]  You know, I love CNN, but you gotta be honest here.
[02:00:01.452 --> 02:00:09.298]  The lower third, what's always on the chyrons, the panelists, the so-called experts, constantly saying she can't lose, the race is over, the path is narrowed.
[02:00:09.318 --> 02:00:09.818]  And you know what?
[02:00:09.938 --> 02:00:11.840]  I actually thank you guys in part for that.
[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:13.260]  I've never heard anybody say that.
[02:00:14.061 --> 02:00:15.562]  I've never heard anybody say the race was over.
[02:00:15.602 --> 02:00:21.046]  We've been saying all along that Donald Trump has a path to the presidency, and she... You can say, wow, he won.
[02:00:21.086 --> 02:00:22.407]  I've never said that the race was over.
[02:00:22.447 --> 02:00:23.848]  We can replay it as many tapes as you want.
[02:00:24.128 --> 02:00:24.608]  Let's move on.
[02:00:34.358 --> 02:00:42.283]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[02:00:42.323 --> 02:00:44.264]  Now, this is our 20th product.
[02:00:45.045 --> 02:00:51.949]  We can easily go out to a major vitamin or supplement company and private label a thousand different products.
[02:00:52.549 --> 02:00:58.333]  But it's taken us four plus years to even come out with 20, because we private label some, but we also develop
[02:00:59.224 --> 02:01:08.989]  Many of the products originally with some of the top labs in the country show that they're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe, and they're also very affordable.
[02:01:09.009 --> 02:01:09.349]  Exactly.
[02:01:09.369 --> 02:01:11.150]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[02:01:11.170 --> 02:01:11.650]  You talk about
[02:01:12.267 --> 02:01:14.509]  We're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[02:01:14.549 --> 02:01:15.830]  We've both talked to them.
[02:01:16.130 --> 02:01:22.036]  They have conveyor belts of herbs falling on the ground and they have someone come and sweep them up and put them back on the conveyor belt.
[02:01:22.376 --> 02:01:31.344]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[02:01:32.205 --> 02:01:33.306]  We refuse to screw people.
[02:01:33.666 --> 02:01:34.627]  We refuse to do that.
[02:01:35.008 --> 02:01:37.030]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[02:01:37.411 --> 02:01:39.693]  We're producing something we want to take.
[02:01:39.793 --> 02:01:40.234]  Exactly.
[02:01:40.594 --> 02:01:41.636]  We're looking for the best.
[02:01:41.676 --> 02:01:46.541]  We went out and searched for the best to private label and most of the time found out it wasn't available.
[02:01:46.762 --> 02:01:50.546]  So we go to these big firms and say we want to make the dream formula.
[02:01:50.606 --> 02:01:54.369]  Yes, and in this case, with Bio PCA, there's nothing out there that is what we wanted.
[02:01:54.629 --> 02:01:55.470]  So we made our own.
[02:01:55.570 --> 02:01:58.112]  We went with chemists and scientists and we actually created this formula.
[02:01:58.532 --> 02:02:01.775]  And it's a proprietary blend, as in, you're not going to get this anywhere else.
[02:02:02.135 --> 02:02:08.140]  Bio PCA, for example, one of the ingredients is silica, and it's from bamboo extract.
[02:02:08.641 --> 02:02:09.661]  It's everywhere.
[02:02:09.822 --> 02:02:10.482]  It's in nature.
[02:02:10.562 --> 02:02:12.524]  It's an essential part of being healthy, right?
[02:02:13.024 --> 02:02:19.069]  Just this bottle of silica, okay, again, one ingredient, in a lower amount that's even in our product, is $35.
[02:02:20.290 --> 02:02:25.554]  They're charging more than what we charge when they have one ingredient that's less than ours.
[02:02:25.594 --> 02:02:26.235]  This is insane.
[02:02:26.255 --> 02:02:35.442]  When I told him we wanted 10,000 micrograms, he goes, okay, I get that you guys want to do, you know, high power stuff, but why don't you just do 3,000 and then you can sell, you know, multiple bottles of it.
[02:02:35.462 --> 02:02:36.263]  People will buy more of it.
[02:02:36.303 --> 02:02:37.284]  I was like, no, let's do 10.
[02:02:37.424 --> 02:02:37.584]  Okay.
[02:02:38.045 --> 02:02:38.925]  Compare that to this.
[02:02:39.145 --> 02:02:40.547]  This is a $50 product.
[02:02:40.847 --> 02:02:44.069]  One of the leaders in the industry has 3,000 micrograms of biotin.
[02:02:44.190 --> 02:02:44.310]  Okay.
[02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:44.610]  We have 10,000.
[02:02:44.690 --> 02:02:45.491]  This is $50, $48 to be exact.
[02:02:48.553 --> 02:02:53.615]  Obviously, if it's making the hair, the skin, the nails healthier, what is it doing in the body?
[02:02:53.835 --> 02:02:54.775]  It's systematic, right?
[02:02:54.915 --> 02:03:00.096]  So obviously, if your skin and your hairs and your nails are looking better, then you're at the root level changing things.
[02:03:00.477 --> 02:03:02.117]  I want products I'm going to use for my family.
[02:03:02.317 --> 02:03:02.897]  I take this.
[02:03:03.317 --> 02:03:04.358]  My family takes this.
[02:03:04.898 --> 02:03:09.739]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find anywhere.
[02:03:09.799 --> 02:03:11.240]  So what you find in our information
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:15.882]  In our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[02:03:15.922 --> 02:03:24.005]  Bio PCA hair and nails formula available at Infowarslife.com today or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:03:24.025 --> 02:03:26.646]  There's no script, no teleprompter, I'll be honest with you.
[02:03:27.066 --> 02:03:29.427]  My problem is with 20 products now...
[02:03:30.908 --> 02:03:32.329]  It's remembering to take them all.
[02:03:32.929 --> 02:03:36.171]  Because when I do, I have great days, great weeks, a great life.
[02:03:36.612 --> 02:03:45.317]  When I forget to take the X2, a super male, or the lung cleanse, or to do a liver cleanse, or to take this product, my quality of life just isn't as good.
[02:03:45.397 --> 02:03:46.478]  It's changed my life.
[02:03:46.578 --> 02:03:48.819]  I looked like Jabba the Hutt four years ago.
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:51.041]  I was swimming two miles some days a day.
[02:03:51.421 --> 02:03:52.882]  I was jogging, lifting weights.
[02:03:52.942 --> 02:03:53.763]  I couldn't lose the weight.
[02:03:54.688 --> 02:04:01.762]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[02:04:02.143 --> 02:04:02.905]  It's a win-win.
[02:04:03.386 --> 02:04:04.167]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:04:14.128 --> 02:04:19.811]  I want to see 10 million viewers tune in over the 50-plus hours, and that's where you come in.
[02:04:20.271 --> 02:04:21.992]  You are the heart and blood of the InfoWars.
[02:04:22.312 --> 02:04:33.578]  If you spread the link to InfoWars.com forward slash show and point out that this is the alternative new media, this is the rebellion, then all of you are riding right beside us, not behind us.
[02:04:33.938 --> 02:04:39.501]  So spread the word, my Paul Reveres, no matter where you live in the world, to Information Warfare Arms.
[02:04:39.841 --> 02:04:42.903]  The globalists are coming, and they will be met on the field.
[02:04:43.963 --> 02:04:50.125]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:04:50.505 --> 02:04:53.386]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:04:53.726 --> 02:04:58.927]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:04:59.327 --> 02:05:05.309]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:05:05.449 --> 02:05:08.590]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:05:08.750 --> 02:05:10.170]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:14.534]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:05:14.734 --> 02:05:17.596]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:05:17.676 --> 02:05:19.238]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:05:19.338 --> 02:05:22.541]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:05:22.801 --> 02:05:25.123]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:05:25.403 --> 02:05:26.364]  It's in powder form.
[02:05:26.464 --> 02:05:29.166]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:05:29.347 --> 02:05:29.947]  I take this.
[02:05:30.067 --> 02:05:31.769]  This is the product that I take.
[02:05:31.869 --> 02:05:33.871]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[02:05:34.671 --> 02:05:35.452]  We fight the Globals.
[02:05:35.472 --> 02:05:36.312]  We fight the New World Order.

[02:05:56.377 --> 02:05:57.858]  All right, and we are live.
[02:05:58.459 --> 02:06:00.320]  We are well into the 52-hour broadcast.
[02:06:00.340 --> 02:06:03.682]  This is Rob Dew, live in the Infowars.com Command Center.
[02:06:04.363 --> 02:06:05.864]  And let me tell you, it's going to be a great two hours.
[02:06:05.904 --> 02:06:06.665]  I've got two hours on.
[02:06:06.685 --> 02:06:07.986]  I've got three guests lined up.
[02:06:08.006 --> 02:06:12.849]  I'm going to have a computer programmer who's created his own polling system, and he's going to be my first guest.
[02:06:12.909 --> 02:06:19.634]  And I've got a writer who writes for Sputnik, and we are Change, who's got an amazing article that came out last night, and it is blowing up on Twitter.
[02:06:20.095 --> 02:06:24.198]  And then the final hour, I'm going to have Stefan Molyneux to basically talk about how
[02:06:25.078 --> 02:06:32.554]  Why the distrust in media is happening now, why it's finally crescendoing, and what a world with Hillary Clinton as president would look like.
[02:06:33.215 --> 02:06:34.718]  But first, I want to get to this.
[02:06:35.854 --> 02:06:39.696]  We have some amazing deals running right now for this 52-hour live election broadcast.
[02:06:39.716 --> 02:06:57.084]  These are unprecedented, and for the next 52 hours, you could get 30% off Super Male Vitality, 30% off DNA Force, 30 to 40% off InfoWare Select Storable Foods, 30% off Survival Shield X2, 30% off Pro Pure King water filter systems,

[02:06:58.765 --> 02:06:59.246]  It's great.
[02:06:59.346 --> 02:07:00.467]  I recommend it.
[02:07:00.667 --> 02:07:05.051]  25% off Secret 12 and 15% off all Mullen Labe apparel.
[02:07:05.351 --> 02:07:08.454]  You can find all these deals at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:07:22.008 --> 02:07:24.229]  By far some of the best stuff out there on the market.
[02:07:24.309 --> 02:07:28.352]  I use a lot of things including DNA Force and X2 every day.
[02:07:28.672 --> 02:07:31.494]  And OcuPower is another great product that I use.
[02:07:31.714 --> 02:07:42.121]  And I don't go out of the country without my Silver Bullet because if I feel a little cold or a cough coming on or something like that, I just start dosing Silver Bullet and that takes care of it.
[02:07:42.581 --> 02:07:44.902]  So be sure you check out all those deals at m4slife.com.
[02:07:44.922 --> 02:07:46.824]  They're only going to be for the next 52 hours.
[02:07:47.404 --> 02:07:50.086]  And so I want to jump into this news real quick before we bring on our first guest.
[02:07:51.249 --> 02:07:53.451]  But first we have an article here from Infowars.
[02:07:53.471 --> 02:07:55.052]  This was just brought to me by Kid Daniels.
[02:07:55.352 --> 02:07:56.533]  This is from Clifford Cunningham.
[02:08:21.169 --> 02:08:21.869]  We're good to go.
[02:08:36.736 --> 02:08:37.296]  I think so.
[02:08:57.862 --> 02:09:09.710]  Alex and I stayed up here until about 8 o'clock just shooting more videos trying to get people pumped up for this because this is the only way we are going to I guess face down the tyrants is by meeting them on the battlefield just like that short ad said.
[02:09:09.730 --> 02:09:11.151]  So we're streaming live on Facebook.
[02:09:11.171 --> 02:09:12.972]  We're streaming live on two YouTube channels.
[02:09:13.373 --> 02:09:15.894]  I think Ron Gibson's also streaming on another YouTube channel.
[02:09:16.154 --> 02:09:18.176]  You need to be streaming this on your YouTube channel.
[02:09:18.496 --> 02:09:20.398]  Go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:09:20.438 --> 02:09:21.219]  Get the free feed.
[02:09:21.519 --> 02:09:22.580]  Stream it on your channel.
[02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:26.664]  Or put your phone in front of your computer and stream it on your Facebook feed.
[02:09:26.904 --> 02:09:27.946]  And send us photos of these.
[02:09:27.966 --> 02:09:31.869]  Go to atrealalexjones on Twitter and send us pictures of your screenshots.
[02:09:31.889 --> 02:09:32.830]  How many people are watching?
[02:09:33.171 --> 02:09:39.978]  We want to show those numbers to people and encourage people to do the same thing because that's how we're going to win this thing is by waking up more people.
[02:09:40.958 --> 02:09:42.039]  But let's get into this first.
[02:09:42.059 --> 02:09:44.000]  This is a New York Times article, came out today.
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:47.602]  TV networks face a skeptical public on election night.
[02:09:47.782 --> 02:09:48.842]  Hmm, I wonder why.
[02:09:49.262 --> 02:09:58.247]  But as television gears up for 2016's big finale, an intense public distrust in the media is threatening the network's traditional role as election night's scorekeeper.
[02:09:58.667 --> 02:09:59.508]  Why is that?
[02:10:00.088 --> 02:10:00.648]  Ask yourself.
[02:10:01.008 --> 02:10:02.829]  Why do people not trust the media anymore?
[02:10:03.370 --> 02:10:05.190]  Well, I'm going to get to a bunch of evidence here in a second.
[02:10:05.210 --> 02:10:09.613]  One of the people they interviewed though, this is the best, George Stephanopoulos.
[02:10:10.453 --> 02:10:10.853]  Okay?
[02:10:11.554 --> 02:10:11.974]  Who's that?
[02:10:12.034 --> 02:10:13.415]  He was former Clinton Chief of Staff.
[02:10:13.715 --> 02:10:14.915]  He said, people are going to be coming to us.
[02:10:14.975 --> 02:10:18.677]  They're also going to be going, to be following us on their phones all day, getting all kinds of information.
[02:10:19.118 --> 02:10:23.880]  Our part, part of our job is to sort through that and give out only what we can be sure of at any given moment.
[02:10:24.481 --> 02:10:26.762]  No, that's what you're told to give out at any given moment.
[02:10:27.541 --> 02:10:28.902]  And so it's very interesting.
[02:10:28.922 --> 02:10:31.343]  They interview a lot of big-name media people on this.
[02:10:32.063 --> 02:10:34.044]  And networks rely on... Voting Night.
[02:10:34.064 --> 02:10:35.365]  This is what's going to happen on election night.
[02:10:35.405 --> 02:10:43.189]  Networks rely on decision desks, which often employ dozens of statisticians and pollsters and receive election returns from the Associated Press.
[02:10:43.249 --> 02:10:43.749]  Remember that?
[02:10:43.769 --> 02:10:44.829]  We're going to get to that in one second.
[02:10:45.170 --> 02:10:47.371]  Which gather data directly from state and local offices.
[02:10:47.631 --> 02:10:54.154]  The desks also subscribe to exit polls from Edison Research, which, you know, used to be called something else, I believe.
[02:10:54.514 --> 02:11:00.275]  And provide a glimpse of the numbers which are often used to characterize voter concerns, demographics, and reasons for supporting a candidate.
[02:11:00.675 --> 02:11:03.636]  Now, Associated Press, they get their numbers from the Associated Press.
[02:11:03.696 --> 02:11:04.496]  Why is that important?
[02:11:04.616 --> 02:11:11.957]  Well, we ran a video and story on November 2nd called NBC caught preparing Hillary victory before election results.
[02:11:12.417 --> 02:11:16.198]  And this goes back to some graphics that WRCBTV.com put up.
[02:11:16.238 --> 02:11:21.059]  This is a local Chattanooga NBC affiliate and they put up Hillary Clinton winning 42% to 40.
[02:11:22.719 --> 02:11:24.600]  And you can see it right there on screen.
[02:11:25.401 --> 02:11:27.002]  Barely winning by a million votes.
[02:11:27.102 --> 02:11:27.682]  Barely winning.
[02:11:29.484 --> 02:11:31.445]  And they posted also the states.
[02:11:32.085 --> 02:11:35.007]  If you scroll down on that, you can see all the state voting.
[02:11:35.027 --> 02:11:36.048]  And people were pissed off.
[02:11:36.068 --> 02:11:37.669]  They were going, why are y'all posting this?
[02:11:37.729 --> 02:11:39.010]  People were claiming, oh, it's fake.
[02:11:39.050 --> 02:11:41.792]  They just were testing graphics, testing graphics.
[02:11:43.424 --> 02:11:45.165]  They came out with an article just a couple days ago.
[02:11:45.225 --> 02:11:52.388]  The Associated Press distributed mock election data to news organizations nationwide last week as part of routine testing.
[02:11:52.828 --> 02:12:00.112]  The AP test data showed a hypothetical scenario with Hillary Clinton winning the election, and screen grabs of that test were widely circulated on social media.
[02:12:00.552 --> 02:12:10.457]  This occurred because test election data appeared for a brief time on public servers for multiple news organizations that subscribe to Associated Press election results, including WRCB.
[02:12:11.397 --> 02:12:17.202]  AP grows to great lengths to clearly mark it as test data, although I don't think they marked it as test data on here.
[02:12:17.222 --> 02:12:18.944]  They said 100% of precincts reporting.
[02:12:19.644 --> 02:12:23.828]  So, they didn't really mark it as test data, and advises its customers to do the same.
[02:12:24.789 --> 02:12:30.314]  Easton declined to comment on why the AP would use test results, which would be confusing if released outside of internal testing sites.
[02:12:31.483 --> 02:12:35.206]  The test data appeared not only for President, but for several state and national races as well.
[02:12:35.226 --> 02:12:38.888]  It was actually every state race for President.
[02:12:38.948 --> 02:12:41.189]  And some, just, you know, some congressional districts.
[02:12:41.630 --> 02:12:47.553]  But now that the testing is complete, WRCB has removed the test data to return its results to zero in preparation for election night.
[02:12:47.834 --> 02:12:49.535]  Because we can trust these people, right?
[02:12:50.615 --> 02:12:51.296]  We can trust them.
[02:12:51.974 --> 02:12:57.055]  And then you have here, this is an interesting little tidbit, and actually my second guest is going to be talking about this.
[02:12:57.075 --> 02:12:57.776]  She wrote about this.
[02:12:58.936 --> 02:13:02.237]  Sanders tries to rally supporters behind Clinton, but they remain wary.
[02:13:02.577 --> 02:13:08.278]  And this is the story of one Caleb Von Fossum who was asked to come out and talk at a Sanders event.
[02:13:08.298 --> 02:13:13.140]  Sanders is there, and he basically didn't do what he was supposed to do.
[02:13:14.100 --> 02:13:17.821]  He pretended like he was fully behind Hillary.
[02:13:18.641 --> 02:13:23.427]  But let's see, I have it over here, but he actually says I highlighted the wrong, here we go.
[02:13:24.980 --> 02:13:27.242]  He says, the other day I got a call asking me if I wanted to speak for Hillary.
[02:13:27.282 --> 02:13:28.843]  Basically, they wanted to use me as a puppet.
[02:13:29.503 --> 02:13:31.545]  And he says, Trump's not any better, but Hillary's still terrible.
[02:13:31.725 --> 02:13:38.971]  But he also said, the only people who can really trust Hillary are Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, the military-industrial complex, and her good friend, Henry Kissinger.
[02:13:38.991 --> 02:13:39.831]  She doesn't care about us.
[02:13:40.251 --> 02:13:42.453]  Voting for a lesser of two evils, there's no point.
[02:13:42.693 --> 02:13:46.856]  And then he was grabbed and pushed off stage after doing that.
[02:13:46.936 --> 02:13:52.681]  So that's what happens to the Sanders supporters when they go deal with Clinton people.
[02:13:53.717 --> 02:13:57.423]  They're pushed around like, like, uh, you know, they, they get treated like chumps.
[02:13:59.185 --> 02:14:00.627]  Uh, and we have this story here.
[02:14:01.088 --> 02:14:03.752]  Hillary Clinton pulls plug on election night fireworks.
[02:14:04.113 --> 02:14:08.099]  So she was supposed to have a big fireworks display and they decided, nah, we're going to cancel that.
[02:14:09.130 --> 02:14:10.251]  Just another little tidbit.
[02:14:10.611 --> 02:14:14.033]  Rampant voter fraud favoring Dems caught in swing states across the U.S.
[02:14:14.053 --> 02:14:17.675]  This is from Chris Manahan of Information Liberation.
[02:14:18.035 --> 02:14:22.677]  Watched the Washington Times' Kelly Riddell run down some of the worst cases so far on Fox & Friends.
[02:14:23.398 --> 02:14:36.825]  So, and then we had Fraction Magic, which just basically, and Alex had a guest on this morning, basically they could just go into the central computer and change the results and have a program in place where they can make it be whatever they want to be.
[02:14:38.105 --> 02:14:39.886]  And then we have this little story here.
[02:14:39.926 --> 02:14:42.307]  Want to know why the Trump team has been so positive of late?
[02:14:42.407 --> 02:14:43.187]  Here's why.
[02:14:43.607 --> 02:14:44.668]  Well, there's four reasons.
[02:14:44.768 --> 02:14:48.489]  First of all, black vote is down considerably over 2012 numbers.
[02:14:48.509 --> 02:14:50.670]  They're just not up for Hillary.
[02:14:50.810 --> 02:14:56.673]  Remember yesterday, Hillary went and had LeBron James and one of the other Cleveland Cavaliers on stage with her.
[02:14:57.153 --> 02:14:59.214]  And you can look out in the crowd and there's no black people in the crowd.
[02:15:00.359 --> 02:15:15.461]  In Cleveland, when millions of people showed up for that parade when they won the championship, and a guard there, or a police officer who was acting as a guard there, sent a picture to Alex showing about 300 people there, plus her entourage.
[02:15:16.022 --> 02:15:20.103]  Second, white turnout is said to be up big time, and Trump leads among white voters over Hillary big time.
[02:15:20.403 --> 02:15:23.244]  Third, Trump continues to show well among independent voters.
[02:15:23.884 --> 02:15:28.225]  And remember, they're polling a lot of independent voters, about 20% on most of these polls.
[02:15:28.285 --> 02:15:32.446]  Fourth, Trump is doing better among female voters than mainstream media polls have indicated.
[02:15:32.486 --> 02:15:37.287]  And lastly, Trump is doing better among Hispanic voters than some mainstream media polls have indicated.
[02:15:38.328 --> 02:15:38.928]  So there you go.
[02:15:39.926 --> 02:15:44.610]  People are big on Trump because they see him as a change of the status quo.
[02:15:45.170 --> 02:15:46.231]  A change on the status quo.
[02:15:46.251 --> 02:15:49.394]  But the mainstream media and the establishment aren't.
[02:15:49.554 --> 02:15:53.758]  Here's my final article before we go to a short video of my guest, my first guest.
[02:15:53.978 --> 02:15:57.401]  Did Newsweek already print a special Madame President Hillary edition?
[02:15:58.424 --> 02:16:00.125]  This is one of the special commemorative editions.
[02:16:00.145 --> 02:16:01.126]  This is done by Newsweek.
[02:16:01.906 --> 02:16:04.348]  And it said Madame President on the front.
[02:16:04.688 --> 02:16:08.051]  Hillary's historic journey to the White House because that's the narrative they want to have.
[02:16:08.071 --> 02:16:09.672]  They want to have the first woman president.
[02:16:10.112 --> 02:16:16.056]  It doesn't matter that it's a lady who's into genocide and witchcraft and other things.
[02:16:16.896 --> 02:16:17.537]  That doesn't matter.
[02:16:19.281 --> 02:16:29.444]  Um, and uh, so a lady saw this and worked at a bookstore and she tweeted out, her name's Megan, I work at a bookstore and we typically get magazines early and lookie what we got here, check the date.
[02:16:29.964 --> 02:16:31.465]  And it's got the date on it already.
[02:16:31.845 --> 02:16:38.647]  Her Twitter account was subsequently deleted after reporter Luke Cawson chastised her for fueling Trumpist hysteria about the rigged election.
[02:16:39.127 --> 02:16:42.648]  Oh, we just have the magazine here that says Madame President!
[02:16:44.989 --> 02:16:48.010]  But don't worry, the election's not rigged, but if it's rigged, it's the Russians.
[02:16:52.469 --> 02:16:56.051]  DNC staffers wrote questions for CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer when he interviewed Trump.
[02:16:56.632 --> 02:16:58.753]  New batch of 8,000 WikiLeaks emails reveals.
[02:17:00.314 --> 02:17:03.576]  WikiLeaks shows Washington Post writer asks for anti-Trump research.
[02:17:04.056 --> 02:17:06.038]  Oh no, there's no collusion with the mainstream media.
[02:17:06.398 --> 02:17:07.098]  Go back to sleep.
[02:17:08.399 --> 02:17:16.304]  Actually, Owen Schroer called Newsweek today to ask him about it, and they go, uh, uh, we have an alternative too that has Trump on it, but you didn't ship it out to stores, did you?
[02:17:16.664 --> 02:17:17.465]  Here is that video.
[02:17:20.285 --> 02:17:26.830]  Yeah, hi, I'm calling regarding some images that have surfaced of your special edition of Madam President.
[02:17:26.910 --> 02:17:29.912]  Can you guys confirm that you guys have already shipped this magazine out?
[02:17:31.193 --> 02:17:33.335]  Oh, it hasn't been shipped to any bookstores?
[02:17:44.680 --> 02:17:52.065]  Uh, I can't confirm any of that, and so I'd rather think that they're made by a third party, usually the liking of C, called Topics Media.
[02:17:52.786 --> 02:17:56.128]  So any questions about the logistics or anything, I can give you their contact information.
[02:17:56.628 --> 02:18:02.572]  Okay, but you guys can confirm that the, uh, Madam President, this isn't just a fake hoax, these have actually been printed?
[02:18:02.592 --> 02:18:04.473]  Correct.
[02:18:04.794 --> 02:18:09.717]  Okay, uh, do you guys have, have you guys printed and shipped out a similar one for Donald Trump, do you know?
[02:18:11.047 --> 02:18:13.768]  Okay, so they've already shipped both of these out.
[02:18:13.788 --> 02:18:16.910]  They're ready to go in case the result goes either way.
[02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:18.230]  All right, alternate print.
[02:18:18.270 --> 02:18:18.591]  We got Trump.
[02:18:33.410 --> 02:18:43.317]  Now my next guest is somebody who has just decided to go out there and bring the fight to the globalists and their multi-billion dollar polling industry, which is totally skewed.
[02:18:44.577 --> 02:18:45.838]  And that's Matthew Lipacek.
[02:18:45.898 --> 02:18:47.178]  He's a 35-year-old programmer.
[02:18:47.659 --> 02:18:51.941]  He's designed kiosks for queuing systems for companies like Whole Foods and B&H Video.
[02:18:52.501 --> 02:18:56.223]  And he spent many years in digital side engine software development.
[02:18:57.143 --> 02:19:02.486]  In 2009, the world of voice took over IP, and that's when he started a telecommunications company based out of New York City.
[02:19:02.626 --> 02:19:05.887]  He runs the website called callforamerica.com.
[02:19:06.628 --> 02:19:08.669]  And basically, he is out there.
[02:19:09.209 --> 02:19:12.131]  He's got robocalls going, doing polls in all 50 states.
[02:19:13.491 --> 02:19:16.512]  And it's showing Trump victory after Trump victory.
[02:19:16.552 --> 02:19:17.392]  So let's bring him on now.
[02:19:17.432 --> 02:19:18.293]  Hey, Matt, how's it going?
[02:19:19.213 --> 02:19:19.873]  It's going really good.
[02:19:19.893 --> 02:19:20.713]  Thanks for having me on, Rob.
[02:19:20.893 --> 02:19:21.133]  Yeah.
[02:19:21.393 --> 02:19:25.195]  Hey, so give a brief rundown of what you're doing at Call for America.
[02:19:25.215 --> 02:19:29.996]  And I'm going to show while you're talking, I'm going to show some of these polling results here that you've been doing.
[02:19:30.236 --> 02:19:32.617]  So go ahead and just give me the rundown of everything.
[02:19:33.057 --> 02:19:35.818]  You called in a couple of days ago, last week sometime.
[02:19:35.838 --> 02:19:39.559]  That's why I wanted to get you back on so we could go over this in a little more in-depth detail.
[02:19:39.839 --> 02:19:40.059]  Go ahead.
[02:19:40.612 --> 02:19:46.395]  Yeah, I called back on and actually in the same moment the website crashed, we made a couple of improvements, so hopefully it doesn't happen today.
[02:19:47.576 --> 02:19:55.680]  But basically, Call for America, it's a crowdfunded pollster and a robodialer system, and I think that it's going to have
[02:19:56.420 --> 02:19:56.620]  I think?
[02:20:15.618 --> 02:20:19.080]  Before the mainstream media even has a chance to relay their propaganda.
[02:20:20.141 --> 02:20:30.428]  What we've been doing for the past week and a half, because this is a lot more than just a polling system, but what we've been doing is we've launched polls in 24 states across the United States, including the swing states.
[02:20:31.028 --> 02:20:36.131]  There are some states that we simply cannot call because it's illegal or they've got some complicated statutes.
[02:20:36.852 --> 02:20:42.756]  And we've called over 800,000 homes so far, and we've got some really interesting numbers.
[02:20:43.196 --> 02:20:44.076]  We're showing that the
[02:20:45.197 --> 02:20:51.582]  Media is trying to portray that everything is so close and so tight together, but that's just not what it's showing up at callforamerica.com.
[02:20:52.222 --> 02:20:59.548]  Yeah, you've got Trump destroying Hillary in Florida, which I thought the Florida one.
[02:20:59.568 --> 02:21:01.930]  766 to 306, those are people who answered.
[02:21:02.010 --> 02:21:09.175]  You called about 20,000 people and about 8,000, I guess, played and they got the message played and 4,000 picked up.
[02:21:09.195 --> 02:21:09.835]  But yeah, 766 to 306 right there.
[02:21:14.807 --> 02:21:15.827]  That's pretty amazing.
[02:21:16.227 --> 02:21:19.348]  And that's, you know, they're showing him neck and neck in Florida.
[02:21:20.028 --> 02:21:21.928]  And you're blowing that poll away.
[02:21:22.089 --> 02:21:24.289]  Idaho he's just throwing around, which I kind of figured he would.
[02:21:25.069 --> 02:21:34.231]  Indiana, even Iowa's got him ahead, or he's got him behind by 10 in Iowa, but there's other polls showing him ahead in Iowa by a couple points.
[02:21:34.271 --> 02:21:35.411]  So I think that's pretty interesting.
[02:21:36.051 --> 02:21:38.432]  But what are some of the most interesting polls that you've seen so far?
[02:21:39.963 --> 02:21:44.104]  What we're just starting today are what's called scientific poll.
[02:21:44.405 --> 02:21:53.307]  We're actually asking people their questions, the primary question of who are they voting for in the election, but then we're gathering their gender and we're gathering their age and their political party affiliation.
[02:21:54.268 --> 02:21:59.670]  That multi-question survey, the results are going to be coming in tonight of the 100,000 people who we've called.
[02:21:59.950 --> 02:22:06.172]  This is the one campaign where everything's not being displayed in real time because we actually extended outside of the system's ability to
[02:22:06.913 --> 02:22:11.488]  per aggregate all these different questions day together that's a feature that's coming soon but um
[02:22:12.659 --> 02:22:21.326]  For me, I think that the data that we're getting at CallForAmerica.com right now, it just proves that polls are all really a bunch of BS.
[02:22:21.966 --> 02:22:24.548]  You know, our polls, can I say that they're 100% accurate?
[02:22:24.628 --> 02:22:24.868]  No.
[02:22:25.249 --> 02:22:28.551]  But I can tell you how they put together polls in the mainstream media.
[02:22:29.052 --> 02:22:35.076]  They try to say, OK, I'm going to get 25 Republicans, I'm going to get 25 Democrats, I'm going to get 25 Independents.
[02:22:35.457 --> 02:22:40.841]  And they go and they buy these leads lists from some company, and then they call them and think they're being fair.
[02:22:41.381 --> 02:22:44.323]  Well, what we're doing differently is we're randomly calling homes.
[02:22:44.383 --> 02:22:45.724]  So we're just taking the white pages.
[02:22:46.224 --> 02:23:00.752]  We've got a database of 200 and some million phone calls and every time someone goes on the site and says, I want to actually sponsor this campaign, they click the button to buy phone calls and they donate $10 and that gets them 1,000 phone calls.
[02:23:03.294 --> 02:23:06.296]  So the capability of the system is really a lot more than just polling.
[02:23:06.336 --> 02:23:08.437]  We've got some really interesting campaigns.
[02:23:08.477 --> 02:23:19.184]  We're actually calling people right now and we're saying a nationally syndicated radio host wants to get your reaction to the following question and play it back in the air.
[02:23:19.564 --> 02:23:21.806]  And then we asked them, what do you think of Hillary?
[02:23:22.206 --> 02:23:25.188]  And then all these different voice recordings were posted on the website.
[02:23:25.528 --> 02:23:27.049]  You can hear what people actually have to say.
[02:23:27.069 --> 02:23:31.352]  And it's just a system I think that every single day, and there it is.
[02:23:31.971 --> 02:23:32.251]  Okay.
[02:23:33.132 --> 02:23:34.052]  Did we crash your system?
[02:23:35.013 --> 02:23:36.454]  Yeah, I knew that might happen.
[02:23:38.215 --> 02:23:45.320]  What's good to know is that when that happens, the calls don't stop because the website is separated from the back end with all the phone calls.
[02:23:45.881 --> 02:23:51.524]  So we're working to scale this to get it to a point where we can support the tens of thousands of views.
[02:23:52.145 --> 02:23:53.706]  And people can customize these, right?
[02:23:53.726 --> 02:23:54.987]  They can customize their own message?
[02:23:56.243 --> 02:23:56.563]  Correct.
[02:23:57.123 --> 02:24:00.305]  They can go and create their whole new campaign on their own.
[02:24:00.845 --> 02:24:05.367]  So if they come up with some particular language, they want to create a poll for anything.
[02:24:05.807 --> 02:24:08.288]  This thing is not just about the 2016 presidential election.
[02:24:08.608 --> 02:24:19.213]  I really think that if we get enough phone calls out there tonight, if you like the campaigns that are on the website, you go and you donate $100, you go and you donate $20, whatever it might be to a campaign, we can really, really make a difference.
[02:24:19.753 --> 02:24:26.421]  But the data that we're collecting right now in this scientific poll, this is going to be able to help us if they steal the election.
[02:24:26.821 --> 02:24:38.295]  If they steal the election, the data that we're containing within this poll, which right now we've got over 4,000 different respondents, and where we're targeting, we're hoping to be able to conclusively say one way or the other what happened.
[02:24:38.915 --> 02:24:47.437]  I'd like to see a poll of if people think that the FBI actually looked at the 650,000 emails because they took them eight days to go through 650,000 emails.
[02:24:47.457 --> 02:24:55.420]  They must have some amazing speed readers there in the FBI and an army of them to just go through that swath of email and go, um, nothing to see.
[02:24:55.760 --> 02:24:56.180]  Nothing to see.
[02:24:56.200 --> 02:24:56.560]  We're fine.
[02:24:57.694 --> 02:25:03.298]  Yes, any type of poll, it would be just, it's so fun to watch as it updates in real time in front of your eyes, you know?
[02:25:03.318 --> 02:25:07.442]  And I would just suggest that if you don't do that yourself, I'm going to do it.
[02:25:07.922 --> 02:25:20.952]  Just go on the Call for America, click on the Add a New Campaign button, and you fill everything in, select what states you want to call, select what cities you want to call if you want to filter it down a little bit, and we'll have you live in minutes.
[02:25:21.472 --> 02:25:21.633]  Wow.
[02:25:22.433 --> 02:25:34.817]  Well, going back to this article from Clifford Cunningham, Trump vs. Clinton, what to watch for in battleground states, they've got in Pennsylvania, the RealClearPolitics had her at plus 2.4%, and they say the battleground counties to watch is Westmoreland.
[02:25:34.877 --> 02:25:36.978]  I actually lived in Westmoreland County for six years.
[02:25:37.498 --> 02:25:46.041]  I drove back through there on our way to the DNC from the RNC, had dinner with a friend of mine, and he had his family over there, and there was seven or eight adults.
[02:25:46.461 --> 02:25:48.742]  Only one of them was voting for Clinton, and these were all Democrats.
[02:25:48.902 --> 02:25:52.585]  They're all lifelong Democrats, registered Democrats, and they say, you know what?
[02:25:52.645 --> 02:25:53.545]  We're voting for Trump.
[02:25:53.846 --> 02:25:54.946]  We're sick of the Clintons.
[02:25:55.467 --> 02:25:56.768]  And I think that's what you're seeing.
[02:25:56.808 --> 02:26:00.631]  A lot of people are sick and tired of what's going on in the status quo.
[02:26:00.651 --> 02:26:01.451]  And I didn't even get to this.
[02:26:02.452 --> 02:26:06.655]  What presidential candidate have we ever heard sit down and say, we're going to have term limits?
[02:26:07.476 --> 02:26:07.736]  Never.
[02:26:08.637 --> 02:26:10.498]  He's the first one to do it in a long time.
[02:26:10.538 --> 02:26:12.800]  Maybe Ross Perot said term limits, but let me tell you.
[02:26:13.729 --> 02:26:16.973]  It's been a long time since I heard the word term limits come out of a presidential candidate.
[02:26:17.293 --> 02:26:20.217]  Because these people are all about dynasty power.
[02:26:20.757 --> 02:26:22.539]  And Trump wants to stop that.
[02:26:22.559 --> 02:26:23.801]  At least he says it's what he wants to stop.
[02:26:23.821 --> 02:26:26.504]  We've got to hold his feet to the fire when we do get him in.
[02:26:28.346 --> 02:26:29.688]  Did you run a poll for Pennsylvania?
[02:26:29.708 --> 02:26:31.510]  Because I didn't see your... Yeah.
[02:26:31.730 --> 02:26:32.031]  You did.
[02:26:32.111 --> 02:26:33.793]  What are the results on Pennsylvania right now?
[02:26:34.580 --> 02:26:41.427]  As of yesterday, it's 44% for Trump and it's 49% for Hillary.
[02:26:41.527 --> 02:26:44.210]  So there you are still showing a swing there for him.
[02:26:44.230 --> 02:26:46.472]  Because I think that Pennsylvania is going to be a big one.
[02:26:47.028 --> 02:26:48.910]  I can tell you Pennsylvania really surprised me.
[02:26:48.930 --> 02:26:51.994]  At the beginning of the week it was looking really, really, really bad.
[02:26:52.294 --> 02:26:54.056]  These are aggregated results over the day.
[02:26:56.099 --> 02:26:59.463]  Every day we aggregate the results and then we've been doing this since the 29th.
[02:26:59.903 --> 02:27:05.470]  So in the beginning the difference was really looking bad but now it seems like we're narrowing out.
[02:27:05.510 --> 02:27:07.052]  So he's closing the lead at this point?
[02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:12.004]  Yeah, but I do think that Pennsylvania is a state where we're going to be very, very tight.
[02:27:12.344 --> 02:27:13.825]  Yeah.
[02:27:13.925 --> 02:27:16.968]  And let me tell you, Philadelphia is known for its election fraud.
[02:27:17.389 --> 02:27:18.570]  They're known for bussing people in.
[02:27:20.011 --> 02:27:25.296]  They say that there's going to be a strike on Tuesday, so people might not be able to catch buses to the polls.
[02:27:25.356 --> 02:27:28.179]  Maybe they won't be able to bus people around to all the polls.
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:32.183]  And then you got you got this article, Matt, I want to get your comment on this.
[02:27:32.743 --> 02:27:36.106]  Inside Donald Trump's last stand, an anxious nominee seeks assurance.
[02:27:36.167 --> 02:27:46.717]  And it's a New York Times article and they talk about how Trump needs to be told he's doing good and he's got this bottomless ego that needs to be stroked constantly and just making him seem like kind of a dirtbag.
[02:27:47.418 --> 02:27:48.398]  You're up in New York.
[02:27:48.459 --> 02:27:50.681]  What's what's your opinion of Donald Trump?
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:53.681]  You know, I love Donald Trump.
[02:27:53.741 --> 02:28:16.016]  I had some difficulty accepting him in the beginning, but the minute that he introduced the word globalization into the narrative of this election, the minute that he stood up and talked about election fraud, talking about Vince Foster, beyond any... I really am at a point where this guy, just because he's a man in the fight, I really don't care about any of his characteristics.
[02:28:16.076 --> 02:28:22.140]  I think he's a man with a very big character and he's got some flaws, but I just love him because he's...
[02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:28.164]  I believe, for the first time since Ron Paul, that this guy is actually going to do what he says.
[02:28:28.544 --> 02:28:29.865]  And I think he's going to make mistakes.
[02:28:30.305 --> 02:28:33.428]  I think he's going to come out the next day and he's going to say, listen, I made a mistake.
[02:28:34.969 --> 02:28:36.129]  This is how we're going to correct it.
[02:28:37.991 --> 02:28:40.432]  I'm a huge advocate of Donald Trump.
[02:28:40.993 --> 02:28:43.455]  And he controls his own Twitter account.
[02:28:44.329 --> 02:28:45.110]  Which I think is great.
[02:28:46.131 --> 02:28:51.717]  It's not 15 staffers sitting together and trying to come up with a clever little gem.
[02:28:51.757 --> 02:28:56.061]  He just throws them out, lobs them every day from his phone.
[02:28:56.101 --> 02:28:56.702]  I think he's great.
[02:28:56.982 --> 02:28:59.425]  So people can go to callforamerica.com.
[02:28:59.445 --> 02:29:04.030]  They could pitch in with their own poll or help fund another poll.
[02:29:04.630 --> 02:29:06.853]  And how much interest have you been getting so far?
[02:29:08.254 --> 02:29:10.696]  You know, we just launched the site two and a half weeks ago.
[02:29:10.856 --> 02:29:15.640]  I'd say right now we're at around 500 unique visitors a day.
[02:29:16.321 --> 02:29:23.707]  We've had roughly around $1,200 that's been donated towards these calls in order to get us to where we are today, plus what I've been putting in there.
[02:29:25.409 --> 02:29:26.830]  And really the push is for tonight.
[02:29:27.150 --> 02:29:30.753]  At 7.30, right now on the East Coast, we've got another hour and a half to call.
[02:29:31.634 --> 02:29:45.227]  Um, we got another three hours on the West Coast, so if you find a campaign that you like, whether it's a poll, we've got some really funny ones, we've got some really scary ones such as the, you know, the satanic occult stuff that came out with Hillary.
[02:29:45.247 --> 02:29:49.552]  You just gotta really decide how do you want to get through to people.
[02:29:50.513 --> 02:29:56.981]  And you also just have some messages they call in and Crooked Hillary just wanted you to know it feels awesome being above the law and if you could work a little bit harder she'd appreciate it.
[02:29:57.021 --> 02:30:04.190]  She wants more taxpayer money because she never held a job in her life and she needs to buy another $12,000 Armani jacket on Tuesday.
[02:30:04.270 --> 02:30:05.711]  Please don't vote for a criminal.
[02:30:06.601 --> 02:30:06.801]  Yes.
[02:30:23.297 --> 02:30:23.798]  Let's get started.
[02:30:44.542 --> 02:30:51.956]  Really interested in what's going on, because that's the key, is making this stuff fast, quick, and nimble, so we're not bogged down, you know, in giant bureaucracies.
[02:30:51.976 --> 02:30:55.744]  And you seem to be a, you know, a one-man army over there doing it, and I want to commend you for doing it.
[02:30:56.957 --> 02:31:01.239]  Yeah, we're going to be making some improvements over the next couple of weeks and things are going to change.
[02:31:01.699 --> 02:31:05.702]  This is basically a two-year project in the works and we were two months behind.
[02:31:05.722 --> 02:31:09.484]  Unfortunately, I think if I had gotten out there a little bit earlier, it could have made a bigger difference.
[02:31:09.544 --> 02:31:12.385]  But hey, we've got four to five hours right now.
[02:31:12.545 --> 02:31:15.687]  We can make as many phone calls as people donate for.
[02:31:16.187 --> 02:31:16.607]  That's right.
[02:31:16.668 --> 02:31:19.210]  And then he also could do exit polling as well.
[02:31:19.690 --> 02:31:21.011]  So I want to commend you for doing that.
[02:31:21.071 --> 02:31:23.053]  Callforamerica.com is the website.
[02:31:23.113 --> 02:31:23.654]  Check it out.
[02:31:24.334 --> 02:31:28.398]  And I want to go... Guys, can you just queue up a two-minute break for me?
[02:31:28.418 --> 02:31:31.981]  Because I got to get this next... My next guest is a writer.
[02:31:32.001 --> 02:31:38.147]  And she put out a story last night that spooked me after looking at it.
[02:31:39.292 --> 02:31:40.772]  I'm going to give you the title of this site.
[02:31:40.792 --> 02:31:42.253]  It's on wearechange.org.
[02:31:42.553 --> 02:31:47.534]  Internet sleuths are convinced that the Podestas are the kidnappers in these police sketches.
[02:31:48.014 --> 02:31:50.995]  And this is a story that spans over 13 years.
[02:31:51.775 --> 02:31:53.415]  And it freaked me out.
[02:31:53.455 --> 02:31:54.996]  I saw it and I almost couldn't believe it.
[02:31:55.076 --> 02:31:59.437]  But then I went to The Guardian, which was the impetus of this article.
[02:32:00.217 --> 02:32:07.739]  And, you know, looked at what others have put, the brain trust around the Internet, and she had the courage enough to put it together in an article and put her name on it.
[02:32:07.759 --> 02:32:08.699]  So we're going to have her up next.
[02:32:08.719 --> 02:32:17.082]  We're going to go to a two-minute break and then come back with Cassandra Fairbanks, who's a writer for We Are Change and Sputnik and a few other sites.
[02:32:17.122 --> 02:32:19.322]  Let's see, Teen Vogue and Tell Us Sir.
[02:32:20.022 --> 02:32:21.663]  And so we'll be right back after this short break.
[02:32:32.077 --> 02:32:33.078]  BrainForce is here.
[02:32:33.618 --> 02:32:35.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:32:36.181 --> 02:32:43.988]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:32:44.778 --> 02:32:47.921]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[02:32:48.201 --> 02:32:48.341]  Right?
[02:32:48.361 --> 02:32:50.703]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[02:32:51.083 --> 02:32:54.586]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:32:54.626 --> 02:32:57.768]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:32:58.269 --> 02:33:03.073]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:33:03.593 --> 02:33:05.455]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[02:33:05.795 --> 02:33:10.218]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:33:10.379 --> 02:33:12.400]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:33:13.021 --> 02:33:14.482]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:33:14.622 --> 02:33:14.862]  Exactly.
[02:33:14.882 --> 02:33:18.687]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:33:19.188 --> 02:33:27.197]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:33:32.296 --> 02:33:39.381]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[02:33:39.761 --> 02:33:52.970]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[02:33:53.908 --> 02:34:05.141]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[02:34:05.802 --> 02:34:11.768]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[02:34:12.509 --> 02:34:20.917]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[02:34:21.558 --> 02:34:29.746]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[02:34:33.004 --> 02:34:35.367]  Alright, my next guest is a writer.
[02:34:35.387 --> 02:34:44.736]  She's a DC-based writer, and she writes for Sputnik News, Teen Vogue, Telesur, Bipartisan Report, and also WeAreChange.org.
[02:34:44.756 --> 02:34:48.661]  Her name is Cassandra Fairbanks, and she first caught my attention
[02:34:49.241 --> 02:34:52.002]  With this article that WikiLeaks actually tweeted out.
[02:34:52.042 --> 02:34:57.083]  And it was, the internet is on fire with speculation that Podesta emails contain code for child sex.
[02:34:57.464 --> 02:35:04.026]  And she's basically reporting on what people are saying out there in Twitter and whatnot about the codes they were using in these emails.
[02:35:04.106 --> 02:35:17.870]  Like, hot dog is a boy, pizza is a girl, cheese is a little girl, pasta is a little boy, ice cream's a male prostitute, walnut or nuts is a person of color, map is semen, and sauce equals an orgy.
[02:35:18.690 --> 02:35:20.871]  And that's among many of the other things we've seen.
[02:35:20.891 --> 02:35:24.313]  We've seen the emails that talk about, we're going to have entertainment coming.
[02:35:24.353 --> 02:35:25.293]  The kids are 11, 9, and 7.
[02:35:25.333 --> 02:35:26.854]  We're going to have the heated pool.
[02:35:27.194 --> 02:35:28.055]  They're going to be there.
[02:35:28.435 --> 02:35:30.176]  Yeehaw, let's go spirit cooking.
[02:35:30.296 --> 02:35:31.676]  I think spirit cooking was another email.
[02:35:32.077 --> 02:35:33.517]  But all that stuff.
[02:35:33.617 --> 02:35:36.639]  And she's been reporting on it for the last few days.
[02:35:36.659 --> 02:35:41.001]  And she's also, she was a Bernie Sanders supporter, but has kind of come over into the Trump world.
[02:35:41.041 --> 02:35:42.442]  So we'll talk to her about that.
[02:35:42.462 --> 02:35:43.922]  She's going to be with us for the next 30 minutes.
[02:35:43.982 --> 02:35:44.763]  Cassandra, can you hear me?
[02:35:45.373 --> 02:35:46.334]  Yes, can you hear me?
[02:35:46.474 --> 02:35:47.435]  Yep, sound great.
[02:35:47.876 --> 02:35:53.661]  So, what got you into, you seem to be collating all this stuff that's going out on Twitter.
[02:35:54.659 --> 02:35:58.041]  Let's first talk about the article that WikiLeaks linked to.
[02:35:58.362 --> 02:36:02.424]  They sent that out on their Twitter, talking about the code in the Podesta emails.
[02:36:03.805 --> 02:36:04.786]  How do you feel about that?
[02:36:05.606 --> 02:36:09.229]  Are public servants out there talking in this sort of fashion?
[02:36:09.329 --> 02:36:17.855]  And, you know, we're not saying this is definite, what they are doing, hot dog equals boy, but this is what's out on the internet and this is the common slang people are saying is what is used.
[02:36:17.935 --> 02:36:19.336]  So, what's your take on all this?
[02:36:20.168 --> 02:36:20.388]  Right.
[02:36:20.789 --> 02:36:33.622]  I don't think that we can really verify what they were saying unless somebody came out and told us what they meant or what code words they were using, if they were using code words, which is pretty likely.
[02:36:33.722 --> 02:36:37.286]  I mean, the phrasing of the email is pretty strange.
[02:36:39.423 --> 02:36:51.527]  That, coupled with a lot of things we've seen in the other releases, like the Spirit Cooking and his weird art collection, make it a little bit scary.
[02:36:51.647 --> 02:36:52.608]  I don't know.
[02:36:55.287 --> 02:36:56.268]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:36:56.368 --> 02:36:58.750]  The spirit cooking was the kicker for me, too.
[02:36:58.770 --> 02:37:01.792]  And then when you look into what that entails and the videos that are out there.
[02:37:02.233 --> 02:37:06.736]  And I guess people were attacking Marina Abramovich, saying you're a Satanist.
[02:37:06.756 --> 02:37:07.717]  And she goes, I'm not a Satanist.
[02:37:07.757 --> 02:37:08.978]  But in her Twitter handle, it says 666.
[02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:13.722]  So, you know, if you're going to be a Satanist, I guess be a proud Satanist.
[02:37:13.742 --> 02:37:15.864]  Don't hide from that fact.
[02:37:15.904 --> 02:37:20.307]  But, you know, I guess she says she's doing it for all shock value and whatnot.
[02:37:20.348 --> 02:37:22.709]  But let's go to this article that came out last night.
[02:37:24.090 --> 02:37:30.333]  I guess people put this together this article that you're referring to in your in yours is a Guardian article here It is right here and guys.
[02:37:30.393 --> 02:37:47.540]  I have it up on screen as well, and this is from 2013 British detectives release if it's of Madeline McCain suspect and then it shows these two pictures and they're supposedly the same person, but then they look like two completely different people and Notice the little mole on
[02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:49.020]  I don't know.
[02:38:18.632 --> 02:38:23.693]  I mean, the first time that I saw it, I was like, that's crazy, I don't know.
[02:38:23.713 --> 02:38:32.516]  And then people kept sending it to me, and the more I looked at it, the more I was like, they really are the spitting image of these police sketches.
[02:38:32.536 --> 02:38:38.398]  And then I've been kind of down the rabbit hole on the whole child sex thing.
[02:38:39.955 --> 02:38:44.719]  So I was like, you know, I'm just gonna write what people are saying and then people come up with their own conclusions.
[02:38:47.821 --> 02:38:54.266]  I think it speaks volumes that people are even discussing this as a serious possibility.
[02:38:54.846 --> 02:39:00.431]  I think it speaks to the trust that people have in the people that Clinton surrounds herself with and are working for her.
[02:39:01.633 --> 02:39:10.077]  Yeah, I mean, you know the company you keep and you see these two guys and it looks exactly like the Podestas.
[02:39:10.137 --> 02:39:13.479]  Maybe this was put out back in 2013 to scare them into something.
[02:39:13.859 --> 02:39:20.102]  You know, they released these things and said, you know, that was a theory floating around the office that the Guardian put this out to say, hey,
[02:39:20.882 --> 02:39:23.122]  We can drop you guys anytime we want.
[02:39:23.162 --> 02:39:25.323]  Maybe that was a message back in 2013.
[02:39:25.843 --> 02:39:29.284]  I think Tony Podesta, did he work for the Clintons or Obama?
[02:39:29.504 --> 02:39:30.924]  Was he part of Obama's transition team?
[02:39:30.944 --> 02:39:31.464]  Is that what it was?
[02:39:31.564 --> 02:39:32.324]  Or was that John?
[02:39:32.344 --> 02:39:34.385]  I think it was John.
[02:39:35.005 --> 02:39:36.465]  I could be getting it mixed up now.
[02:39:36.485 --> 02:39:37.765]  I can look if you want.
[02:39:38.165 --> 02:39:44.486]  Tony Podesta has the weird artwork of little naked girls at his house that he thinks is so funny.
[02:39:44.607 --> 02:39:47.007]  And that article was removed by the Washington Post, wasn't it?
[02:39:47.540 --> 02:39:47.880]  Yeah.
[02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:49.721]  Yeah, that was from 2004.
[02:39:50.301 --> 02:39:51.461]  Go ahead.
[02:39:52.221 --> 02:40:06.825]  Also, the emails in John Podesta that were released from WikiLeaks, they start on May 4th of 2003, and it looks like he had wiped his email account the day before, which would be the day that she went missing.
[02:40:07.827 --> 02:40:08.387]  There you go.
[02:40:08.407 --> 02:40:12.169]  And then there's also other emails of him traveling back to Portugal.
[02:40:12.229 --> 02:40:13.709]  So this isn't a place he's never been.
[02:40:13.729 --> 02:40:17.331]  We don't know for sure if he was there in 2003.
[02:40:18.391 --> 02:40:23.233]  But yeah, the evidence is insane with these guys.
[02:40:23.273 --> 02:40:30.896]  And as you scroll through your article, then it comes to the spirit cooking and dreaming about your hot dog stand in Hawaii.
[02:40:30.936 --> 02:40:32.816]  Mike Cernovich asks, is that code for something?
[02:40:33.116 --> 02:40:34.377]  Sex trafficking, question mark?
[02:40:35.536 --> 02:40:41.659]  And it's just amazing going into these emails and seeing a spotlight into somebody's life.
[02:40:42.660 --> 02:40:48.263]  Because if you search through my emails, it's mainly going to be about, hey, what are we going to do this weekend?
[02:40:48.303 --> 02:40:49.644]  Are we going to go camping?
[02:40:49.964 --> 02:40:55.106]  It's not about weird hot dogs and pizzas and walnuts with sauce.
[02:40:55.126 --> 02:40:59.769]  I don't know who writes like that, unless you're either selling drugs or trafficking kids.
[02:40:59.829 --> 02:41:01.210]  I don't know what else you could be doing.
[02:41:03.191 --> 02:41:03.471]  Great.
[02:41:05.939 --> 02:41:07.419]  It's pretty frightening.
[02:41:07.819 --> 02:41:08.300]  Yeah, it is.
[02:41:08.500 --> 02:41:11.080]  And that these people could be in charge again for another four years.
[02:41:11.140 --> 02:41:15.981]  I mean, Podesta's running around with her, John Podesta's her campaign head right now.
[02:41:16.321 --> 02:41:21.302]  And, you know, this guy could be the chief of staff, the next George Stephanopoulos.
[02:41:21.602 --> 02:41:27.904]  And the power that these people are going to wield if they get in, it's going to be a dark world for everybody, especially for citizen journalists.
[02:41:28.224 --> 02:41:31.184]  I mean, Hillary's already come out and said she's going to come after journalists.
[02:41:31.464 --> 02:41:34.725]  I mean, she basically said the alt-right is her enemy and she's going to destroy them.
[02:41:35.325 --> 02:41:36.006]  Yeah.
[02:41:36.326 --> 02:41:41.190]  What's your fear about that, being censored by a Clinton administration, a future Clinton administration?
[02:41:42.171 --> 02:41:46.694]  I think that we already kind of have a glimpse of what a Clinton administration is going to look like.
[02:41:46.995 --> 02:41:53.139]  I mean, she had that email server so that she could avoid FOIA requests, so that journalists couldn't investigate what she was doing.
[02:41:53.159 --> 02:41:56.302]  I think it's going to be a nightmare.
[02:41:57.323 --> 02:42:01.046]  She's talked about shutting down Breitbart because they disagree with her.
[02:42:01.066 --> 02:42:04.649]  I think it's going to be very dangerous for
[02:42:05.154 --> 02:42:08.456]  For journalists, and especially citizen journalists, or independent journalists.
[02:42:09.216 --> 02:42:12.698]  Yeah, because that's where they can't control the message.
[02:42:12.718 --> 02:42:13.779]  They can't control the narrative.
[02:42:14.359 --> 02:42:19.002]  Washington Post sends stories to the Clintons to see how they are before they post them.
[02:42:19.522 --> 02:42:21.984]  CNN's colluding with them on questions for Trump.
[02:42:22.064 --> 02:42:25.606]  I mean, it is crazy what's going on, and there's no outcry.
[02:42:25.666 --> 02:42:29.628]  If Trump was colluding with CNN to ask questions for Hillary Clinton, it would be the end of the world.
[02:42:30.068 --> 02:42:30.409]  Yeah.
[02:42:30.749 --> 02:42:33.631]  I mean, I got fired from Teen Vogue over it.
[02:42:34.776 --> 02:42:37.879]  I was supporting Bernie at the time, not Trump.
[02:42:38.380 --> 02:42:41.463]  It was back in February, I think.
[02:42:42.083 --> 02:42:45.607]  But I had tweeted out something pro-Bernie.
[02:42:45.647 --> 02:42:48.009]  It wasn't anti-Hillary or anything like that.
[02:42:48.129 --> 02:42:50.772]  But one of Hillary Clinton's surrogates responded.
[02:42:51.616 --> 02:42:52.857]  And she called me sexist.
[02:42:53.058 --> 02:42:54.940]  So I responded and called her a shill.
[02:42:55.520 --> 02:43:08.814]  And a couple hours later, it's like five in the morning, I get an email from Teen Vogue saying that corporate saw my tweet, that picking on the Clintons or people involved with them is a conflict, and that I needed to delete the tweet.
[02:43:09.394 --> 02:43:12.077]  So I did, but I replaced it with one much harsher.
[02:43:12.097 --> 02:43:14.339]  And that was the end of that.
[02:43:15.663 --> 02:43:18.864]  Well, you know, at least you went down guns a-blazing, as they say.
[02:43:19.164 --> 02:43:29.007]  Speaking of being a Bernie supporter and switching to Clinton, or switching to Trump, I personally would have liked to see the Trump-Sanders debate, and I think that's where our country needs to go.
[02:43:29.087 --> 02:43:36.429]  We need to have that debate so we can talk about, do we really need to spend money for all these social programs, or do we need to spend money on wars?
[02:43:37.209 --> 02:43:39.710]  You know, there's a lot of things we could be doing with our money that we don't do.
[02:43:39.730 --> 02:43:44.571]  We spend it on, you know, multi-billion dollar jets that don't fly, or submarines that don't really, you know,
[02:43:45.171 --> 02:43:46.511]  We're good to go.
[02:44:03.496 --> 02:44:08.538]  Well, I was a supporter of Bernie Sanders for much of the same reasons that I support Donald Trump.
[02:44:08.698 --> 02:44:09.879]  I'm against the TPP.
[02:44:10.459 --> 02:44:13.820]  I'm against nonsensical intervention.
[02:44:13.920 --> 02:44:18.622]  I'm not against war necessarily, but I'm against it for things that don't concern us.
[02:44:19.602 --> 02:44:25.604]  And Trump and Bernie Sanders have both also echoed that stance.
[02:44:26.004 --> 02:44:27.665]  Trump wants to invest here at home.
[02:44:28.505 --> 02:44:30.766]  There's a lot of overlap when you really get into it.
[02:44:31.957 --> 02:44:32.398]  Yeah, there is.
[02:44:32.778 --> 02:44:42.611]  And, you know, the big thing was I think their tax programs where Trump would seem like he's going to lower taxes and Bernie said he wanted to at least raise them on the upper class.
[02:44:43.051 --> 02:44:45.955]  But, you know, we can argue about that all day.
[02:44:46.216 --> 02:44:50.121]  I think when you lower taxes, you get more people spending more money because they have more money to spend and that's going to...
[02:44:50.561 --> 02:44:52.362]  You know, increase your economy no matter what.
[02:44:53.383 --> 02:45:12.053]  And I look at the money I spend on my taxes that I have to pay and, you know, it would fund two really nice vacations, which I think would stimulate the economy more than giving it to the government to waste half of it, lose half of it, and then, you know, spend a little bit here and there on these peanut social programs that aren't designed to help people.
[02:45:12.093 --> 02:45:15.635]  They're designed to keep people on a plantation, essentially.
[02:45:15.915 --> 02:45:16.796]  A social plantation.
[02:45:18.649 --> 02:45:19.049]  I agree.
[02:45:19.069 --> 02:45:23.312]  So I ended up supporting Trump.
[02:45:23.392 --> 02:45:30.417]  I mean, I was watching all his speeches because I was trying to pick out headlines to write negative stories about him.
[02:45:31.317 --> 02:45:32.338]  And that was my job.
[02:45:33.479 --> 02:45:41.204]  But after watching the speeches and just actually listening to what he was saying, it kind of won me over.
[02:45:43.335 --> 02:45:46.236]  Yeah, I think, I mean, his speeches are amazing if you sit and watch them.
[02:45:46.777 --> 02:45:47.837]  Nobody's talking about this.
[02:45:47.957 --> 02:45:51.839]  I love his Gettysburg Address when he was talking about, you know, this is my first hundred days.
[02:45:51.859 --> 02:45:53.460]  We're going to put in term limits.
[02:45:53.940 --> 02:45:57.101]  We're going to get rid of special interest money in politics.
[02:45:58.662 --> 02:46:08.306]  You know, I can't remember them all offhand, but the term limits thing is what really got me, because we are not going to have a change in this country, no matter who gets in office, if we have career politicians.
[02:46:08.926 --> 02:46:09.246]  Okay.
[02:46:10.347 --> 02:46:12.687]  Back in the day, these guys didn't even get paid a salary.
[02:46:12.947 --> 02:46:17.409]  They did it, and then they left office because, you know, it was a burden to them.
[02:46:17.589 --> 02:46:18.529]  And it's not like that now.
[02:46:18.569 --> 02:46:27.953]  Now it's a cushy, three-day-a-week job, where you get a staff, and you get all these allowances, and then you get free, gold-standard health care for the rest of your life.
[02:46:27.993 --> 02:46:30.654]  You get your pension, which is your salary for the rest of your life.
[02:46:31.074 --> 02:46:33.895]  And so people want to get in there and just suck off the system.
[02:46:34.455 --> 02:46:39.538]  And, you know, I really need to think we need term limits and get rid of these pension programs.
[02:46:39.678 --> 02:46:44.822]  If you're so good enough to get elected as a representative, you can surely make it in the real world with everybody else.
[02:46:45.022 --> 02:46:45.402]  Your thoughts?
[02:46:45.422 --> 02:46:45.822]  Agreed.
[02:46:46.523 --> 02:46:47.744]  I absolutely agree.
[02:46:47.844 --> 02:46:52.146]  I mean, that's why I personally, I was pushing so hard against Sean McCain.
[02:46:52.167 --> 02:46:56.789]  I think he's been in there for way too long and isn't getting enough done.
[02:46:58.391 --> 02:47:03.394]  But yeah, term limits are a big deal for a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters, I think.
[02:47:04.005 --> 02:47:13.873]  Yeah, we have a representative here who, when he holds town hall meetings, he makes everybody line up and he talks to one person at a time so you think you're getting something.
[02:47:13.893 --> 02:47:17.116]  But really what he's doing is tailoring his answers for your question.
[02:47:17.136 --> 02:47:21.739]  So he'll BS the first person, then BS the next person, and BS... And this guy's been in forever.
[02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:23.381]  And it's just, you know what?
[02:47:23.521 --> 02:47:23.961]  Go home.
[02:47:24.242 --> 02:47:27.464]  Let somebody... I'm sure there's enough people in the United States that could do your job.
[02:47:27.885 --> 02:47:29.926]  You know, especially in Austin.
[02:47:29.946 --> 02:47:30.687]  There's plenty of people.
[02:47:31.227 --> 02:47:31.867]  So where do you want to go?
[02:47:31.887 --> 02:47:33.588]  What do you want to see happen from here?
[02:47:33.808 --> 02:47:36.089]  Are you concerned about the election vote rigging?
[02:47:36.909 --> 02:47:49.633]  Have you heard about this thing, Fraction Magic, where they're going to manipulate the code at the central computer and they could just put, we want this candidate to get this percentage and this one to get this percentage and the computer does it all for them so they don't have to shave votes.
[02:47:49.673 --> 02:47:53.814]  They could just, you know, snap their fingers essentially and change the outcome of an election.
[02:47:54.695 --> 02:47:56.815]  Yeah, I think that's a huge concern.
[02:47:56.855 --> 02:47:57.916]  I've been following that.
[02:47:59.059 --> 02:48:02.541]  Reading up on it, I don't know what we could actually do about it.
[02:48:03.402 --> 02:48:09.726]  I think that as Bernie supporters learn during the primary, they're going to do whatever they want and they're going to get away with it.
[02:48:09.946 --> 02:48:12.948]  I mean, California ballots didn't even get counted.
[02:48:12.968 --> 02:48:18.132]  Tons went missing in New York and there was no accountability.
[02:48:18.212 --> 02:48:20.173]  There's never accountability for the Clintons.
[02:48:20.793 --> 02:48:26.017]  So hopefully it's on the up and up because if it is, I think that Trump is going to win easily.
[02:48:26.971 --> 02:48:28.972]  But if not, I don't know.
[02:48:29.632 --> 02:48:34.514]  How many Bernie supporters do you think, percentage-wise, are switching to Trump?
[02:48:34.534 --> 02:48:42.718]  I would say it's probably somewhere around 10%, but I would say that there's probably 30% or more who aren't voting for Hillary Clinton.
[02:48:44.658 --> 02:48:50.781]  There's a lot of people who switched to Jill Stein or Gary Johnson or who are just sitting it out entirely.
[02:48:52.332 --> 02:48:53.012]  We don't really.
[02:48:53.352 --> 02:48:55.593]  Bernie's supporters never liked her.
[02:48:55.914 --> 02:48:56.654]  Yeah, they never did.
[02:48:56.674 --> 02:48:57.634]  I agree.
[02:48:57.654 --> 02:48:59.295]  And when we were at the DNC, it was like that.
[02:48:59.675 --> 02:49:05.398]  These people were just heartbroken that they weren't even going to get a chance to go in and show their support for Bernie.
[02:49:05.438 --> 02:49:06.218]  They were kicked out.
[02:49:06.258 --> 02:49:10.300]  They had this two-mile radius around the whole convention area.
[02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:17.803]  And at the RNC, it was about 100 yards from the gate to get to the front entrance of the convention hall.
[02:49:18.343 --> 02:49:19.765]  And, you know, it's just ridiculous.
[02:49:19.845 --> 02:49:21.386]  They treat their people like scum.
[02:49:21.746 --> 02:49:22.907]  They treat them like they hate them.
[02:49:23.368 --> 02:49:28.372]  And it's just a shame that she was able to install herself with the help of a bunch of unscrupulous people.
[02:49:29.233 --> 02:49:33.357]  Cassandra Anderson, where can people find you on Twitter or on a website out there?
[02:49:33.977 --> 02:49:34.477]  Fairbanks.
[02:49:34.698 --> 02:49:37.360]  It's CassandraRules on Twitter.
[02:49:37.380 --> 02:49:40.183]  I'm also launching a new site with Tim Pool.
[02:49:40.223 --> 02:49:41.484]  It's Subverse.net.
[02:49:42.785 --> 02:49:43.866]  Sputnik, WeirdChange.
[02:49:43.906 --> 02:49:44.727]  I'm all over the place.
[02:49:45.831 --> 02:49:46.733]  That's what you have to do.
[02:49:46.753 --> 02:49:52.245]  You have to diversify your portfolio, as they say, and that keeps us all, you know, keeps everything running and gunning.
[02:49:52.285 --> 02:49:55.532]  But, you know, you seem like you're able to make a living as a writer.
[02:49:55.573 --> 02:49:56.054]  Is that correct?
[02:49:56.676 --> 02:49:57.956]  Yeah, I'm doing pretty well.
[02:49:58.236 --> 02:49:58.777]  There you go.
[02:49:58.797 --> 02:50:00.417]  That's what it takes, people.
[02:50:00.757 --> 02:50:02.717]  We put out a message yesterday.
[02:50:02.777 --> 02:50:11.640]  My son is in a journalism class in sixth grade and he's doing his report on newsmakers and reporters in the news and stuff.
[02:50:11.660 --> 02:50:17.721]  He picked Alex Jones and he actually shot a video of Alex asking him a question for aspiring journalists.
[02:50:17.801 --> 02:50:24.083]  Alex said, follow your passion and don't listen to anybody else and don't take my version of it or anybody else's version.
[02:50:24.143 --> 02:50:25.143]  You have your own version.
[02:50:25.723 --> 02:50:32.090]  And as long as you're telling the truth to the best of your ability of the information you're getting, you're going to do fine.
[02:50:32.131 --> 02:50:37.637]  Don't worry about making money because if you're passionate and you're there doing it every day and running with the ball, you're going to be successful.
[02:50:40.293 --> 02:50:41.594]  All right, well we'll leave it there.
[02:50:41.854 --> 02:50:42.995]  I've got another guest coming up.
[02:50:43.035 --> 02:50:46.156]  I want to go to another quick short break while I reset.
[02:50:46.216 --> 02:50:51.920]  I've kind of shuffled my articles around, and once again you can follow Cassandra at Twitter at Cassandra Rules.
[02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:54.701]  I just tweeted out her Twitter hashtag there.
[02:50:54.721 --> 02:50:59.704]  You can find me at DewsNews, D-E-W-S-N-E-W-Z, and this is what it's all about.
[02:51:00.104 --> 02:51:02.046]  Bernie supporters are switching over to Trump.
[02:51:02.126 --> 02:51:03.586]  It actually is happening.
[02:51:03.927 --> 02:51:05.748]  Maybe not in the numbers we'd like to see,
[02:51:06.448 --> 02:51:17.084]  But I think you're seeing a lot of people just even, you know, distancing themselves from Hillary and Trump altogether, and they're just going to Jill Stein, which is definitely... I would rather see him go to Trump, but...
[02:51:18.027 --> 02:51:19.789]  Because we really need a landslide at this point.
[02:51:19.869 --> 02:51:25.255]  It's too close to call and that's what they want so they can steal it at the electronic voting machine level.
[02:51:25.275 --> 02:51:28.659]  Which is why we need to get rid of electronic voting machines and go back to the purple finger.
[02:51:29.059 --> 02:51:30.921]  You gotta have the purple finger and the paper ballot.
[02:51:31.402 --> 02:51:32.583]  Purple finger and paper ballot.
[02:51:32.603 --> 02:51:35.486]  That should be a new political party.
[02:51:35.927 --> 02:51:38.369]  And it's all about paper voting machines and you know what?
[02:51:38.690 --> 02:51:39.310]  We could take
[02:51:40.214 --> 02:51:40.554]  I don't
[02:52:00.222 --> 02:52:02.323]  You know, there's plenty of ways we could do it.
[02:52:02.563 --> 02:52:03.163]  We're all smart.
[02:52:03.183 --> 02:52:07.625]  We could all sit in a room and figure it out in about two days how to have an election system that can't be rigged.
[02:52:07.885 --> 02:52:08.785]  Because that's the key.
[02:52:09.045 --> 02:52:12.947]  When they can rig the elections, they can take anything they want, and you can't stop them.
[02:52:12.967 --> 02:52:18.288]  So we're going to go to a quick break, and I'll cover some more news, and then we'll come back with my next guest, Stefan Molyneux.
[02:52:18.408 --> 02:52:20.969]  And hopefully we might even fire up the call system and take some calls.
[02:52:21.009 --> 02:52:22.630]  I'm going to talk to the guys about this during the break.
[02:52:22.950 --> 02:52:24.751]  So let's make it a three-minute break, guys.
[02:52:24.791 --> 02:52:25.291]  See what we can do.
[02:52:25.851 --> 02:52:26.511]  All right, here we go.
[02:52:26.591 --> 02:52:27.412]  We'll be right back.
[02:52:27.472 --> 02:52:28.852]  It's the 52-hour special.
[02:52:28.932 --> 02:52:32.994]  Oh, before we go, while we're on break, check out InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:52:33.014 --> 02:52:45.458]  We got 30% off Super Male Vitality, 30% off DNA Force, 30 to 40% off InfoWars Select Storable Food, 30% off Survival Shield X2, 30% off Pro Pure King water filter systems.
[02:52:45.498 --> 02:52:46.278]  I got one in my house.
[02:52:46.358 --> 02:52:46.778]  I love it.
[02:52:47.279 --> 02:52:48.339]  We go through it every day.
[02:52:48.359 --> 02:52:50.040]  I get home at night and I'm like, where's the water?
[02:52:50.060 --> 02:52:50.940]  I got to fill it up again.
[02:52:51.420 --> 02:52:55.624]  25% off Secret 12 and 15% off all Mullen Lambe apparel.
[02:52:55.644 --> 02:53:02.190]  If you're not getting X2 and DNA Force, man, check it out because this stuff is amazing.
[02:53:02.210 --> 02:53:07.194]  I took my super male vitality this morning and it definitely boosted me up.
[02:53:07.214 --> 02:53:11.318]  I was a little tired after being up here from 4 o'clock to 9 o'clock last night.
[02:53:11.338 --> 02:53:16.583]  I basically put in a long day, plus working at my house before that.
[02:53:17.864 --> 02:53:18.344]  This is it.
[02:53:18.604 --> 02:53:20.385]  You know, after Tuesday, it's over.
[02:53:20.845 --> 02:53:21.325]  We're done.
[02:53:21.886 --> 02:53:23.506]  And let the chips fall where they may.
[02:53:23.546 --> 02:53:25.707]  I'm going to leave my guts on the battlefield.
[02:53:25.727 --> 02:53:28.348]  So let's go to that break and check out InfoWars Live while we're on break.
[02:53:28.368 --> 02:53:30.209]  This is Rob Due reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:53:30.229 --> 02:53:35.611]  You're watching the 52-hour broadcast here at the Alex Jones Show at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:53:35.651 --> 02:53:37.012]  Spread the link far and wide.
[02:53:59.238 --> 02:54:07.170]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[02:54:07.230 --> 02:54:10.335]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[02:54:11.121 --> 02:54:13.002]  And they're also very affordable.
[02:54:35.129 --> 02:54:41.855]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the InfoWar change the country and the world.
[02:54:42.256 --> 02:54:43.016]  It's a win-win.
[02:54:43.497 --> 02:54:44.258]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:54:49.733 --> 02:54:51.594]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[02:54:51.654 --> 02:54:53.535]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:54:53.616 --> 02:54:56.357]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:54:56.537 --> 02:54:57.358]  Alex Jones.
[02:54:57.438 --> 02:55:00.220]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:55:00.260 --> 02:55:03.482]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:55:03.502 --> 02:55:04.823]  Deeply I think racist.
[02:55:04.923 --> 02:55:06.764]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[02:55:06.864 --> 02:55:08.665]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[02:55:08.685 --> 02:55:12.768]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[02:55:12.808 --> 02:55:13.949]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:14.009 --> 02:55:18.912]  Watch the free stream live at inforce.com forward slash show.
[02:55:21.011 --> 02:55:24.453]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:55:24.794 --> 02:55:31.938]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:55:32.539 --> 02:55:40.904]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:55:41.145 --> 02:55:45.247]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:55:45.568 --> 02:55:50.811]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[02:55:51.151 --> 02:55:54.973]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:55:55.393 --> 02:55:58.475]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[02:55:58.815 --> 02:56:09.900]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[02:56:09.940 --> 02:56:12.621]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[02:56:12.861 --> 02:56:18.824]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[02:56:19.424 --> 02:56:20.426]  BrainForce is here.
[02:56:20.947 --> 02:56:23.250]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:31.322]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:56:32.113 --> 02:56:35.276]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[02:56:35.536 --> 02:56:35.696]  Right?
[02:56:35.716 --> 02:56:38.038]  You're gonna crash and you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:56:38.418 --> 02:56:41.921]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:56:41.961 --> 02:56:45.103]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:56:45.604 --> 02:56:50.588]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:56:50.948 --> 02:56:52.790]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[02:56:53.130 --> 02:56:57.553]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:56:57.714 --> 02:56:59.735]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:57:00.356 --> 02:57:01.817]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:57:01.957 --> 02:57:02.217]  Exactly.
[02:57:02.237 --> 02:57:06.220]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:14.645]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:57:14.665 --> 02:57:15.186]  Alright, we are back.
[02:57:22.341 --> 02:57:24.262]  Deep into the 52-hour broadcast.
[02:57:24.302 --> 02:57:26.984]  I guess this is the first section, the first salvo.
[02:57:27.004 --> 02:57:29.025]  I just want to check the Facebook feed.
[02:57:29.766 --> 02:57:32.548]  About 10,000 people watching just on Facebook.
[02:57:33.709 --> 02:57:35.049]  Probably got more than that on YouTube.
[02:57:35.089 --> 02:57:38.932]  We had about 20,000 during the Alex Jones Show today.
[02:57:39.132 --> 02:57:43.995]  That is every day from, well, every weekday from 11 to 3 p.m.
[02:57:44.015 --> 02:57:45.056]  and then on Sunday 4 to 6.
[02:57:45.656 --> 02:57:46.877]  Those are all central times.
[02:57:47.177 --> 02:57:50.680]  And we're going to be here until Wednesday at 3 o'clock.
[02:57:51.530 --> 02:57:57.531]  So it's only Monday, 6.56 right now, 6.56 Central Time, and we're going to be fighting hard.
[02:57:57.571 --> 02:58:00.412]  We're going to be putting out the news as quickly as we can.
[02:58:00.432 --> 02:58:09.194]  I just want to tell you once again, if you didn't go during the break that we put out there, go to Infowarslife.com or Infowarsstore.com and check out the great deals we have.
[02:58:09.214 --> 02:58:10.114]  I just want to go over these again.
[02:58:10.134 --> 02:58:14.695]  30% off Super Male Vitality, 30% off DNA Force, 30 to 40% off
[02:58:17.856 --> 02:58:20.238]  Info Wars select storable foods.
[02:58:20.378 --> 02:58:23.200]  There's a lot of people getting storable foods right now.
[02:58:23.300 --> 02:58:26.382]  So if you don't have any, you may want to consider getting some of those.
[02:58:26.402 --> 02:58:28.523]  We've got some great deals on Info Wars select.
[02:58:28.563 --> 02:58:38.210]  Comes in those really nice totes too, where you can store them well, not just in a cardboard box that could, you know, if it gets wet, it could start rotting or whatever, or, you know, get, destroy the box, whatever.
[02:58:38.230 --> 02:58:39.611]  These are nice big plastic totes.
[02:58:40.433 --> 02:59:00.760]  30% off Survival Shield X2, 30% off ProPure King water filter systems, and those are awesome multi-gallon systems that provide fluoride-free, chlorine-free, bromide-free water, anything that your municipality puts in your water that they tell you it's for your health.
[02:59:01.140 --> 02:59:02.960]  It takes all that out, because it's not for your health.
[02:59:03.060 --> 02:59:07.702]  It's basically to keep you stupid and calcify your pineal gland, which sits right up here.
[02:59:08.742 --> 02:59:13.066]  25% off Secret 12, 15% off all Mullen Labe apparel.
[02:59:13.086 --> 02:59:17.569]  That's InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:18.010 --> 02:59:19.871]  So check all that out.
[02:59:20.972 --> 02:59:29.139]  Well, last guest, very interesting with those schematics there of the Podesta brothers that look like the Podesta brothers.
[02:59:29.179 --> 02:59:32.642]  We're not saying they are, but man, if the shoe fits.
[02:59:33.002 --> 02:59:35.144]  Geez, crazy, crazy stuff.
[02:59:36.738 --> 02:59:58.280]  And coming up I'm going to have in a couple minutes we're going to bring on Stefan Molyneux and I'm going to ask him basically kind of cover, rehash what we covered before on this media, why the media is just so distrusted at this point and people can see through the lies, they can see through the manipulations, you know, it doesn't matter how much money you have, you cannot
[02:59:59.824 --> 03:00:03.547]  You know, just break people's will with your propaganda.
[03:00:03.607 --> 03:00:04.708]  It's not going to happen anymore.
[03:00:05.549 --> 03:00:10.173]  And also, while he's on, we're going to take your call so we can start loading up the phone lines.
[03:00:10.193 --> 03:00:10.293]  877-789-2539.
[03:00:10.313 --> 03:00:10.574]  That's 877-789-2539.
[03:00:10.594 --> 03:00:10.634]  877-789-2539.
[03:00:10.694 --> 03:00:14.377]  And I think one of you guys might have to come back in here and log me in onto the system.
[03:00:26.681 --> 03:00:27.621]  Doesn't seem to be.
[03:00:28.742 --> 03:00:29.922]  Doesn't seem to be pulling up.
[03:00:30.362 --> 03:00:30.802]  Oh, there it goes.
[03:00:31.642 --> 03:00:34.583]  All right.
[03:00:34.663 --> 03:00:36.183]  So my next guest, you may have heard him.
[03:00:36.223 --> 03:00:38.084]  He was on the show earlier today with Alex.
[03:00:38.104 --> 03:00:46.266]  He's the founder and host of Free Domain Radio, the largest and most popular philosophy show in the world with 2,600 podcasts.
[03:00:46.426 --> 03:00:49.207]  And he's got 10 books and 50 million downloads.
[03:00:49.867 --> 03:00:53.968]  Stefan has spread the word of liberty and philosophy to listeners around the world.
[03:00:56.095 --> 03:00:56.736]  Oh, he's not on yet?
[03:00:56.776 --> 03:01:00.719]  Well, I'm going to just go ahead and read over his bio and tell you I'll get him on.
[03:01:03.202 --> 03:01:20.758]  He's written two novels, Revolutions and The God of Atheists, and eight non-fiction books on relationships, government, and religion, and you can find more of his... I say long-winded very nicely because he's an eloquent speaker that can go on for about 30 minutes on one subject.
[03:01:20.798 --> 03:01:21.478]  In fact, I think
[03:01:22.359 --> 03:01:34.123]  One of the videos that got me really interested in him was the Trayvon Martin series he did, and he said why we shouldn't be going after this policeman after all this.
[03:01:34.143 --> 03:01:36.244]  But it took him about 30 minutes to get through the whole thought.
[03:01:36.284 --> 03:01:42.766]  He really takes a long time to cover every facet of the topic he's talking about.
[03:01:43.286 --> 03:01:44.647]  And so it's very interesting to listen to.
[03:01:44.667 --> 03:01:45.567]  He's got a nice voice.
[03:01:45.607 --> 03:01:46.468]  He's up in Canada.
[03:01:46.948 --> 03:01:51.451]  So he doesn't have a dog in the fight, I guess, in this, but he sure is a Trump supporter.
[03:01:52.171 --> 03:01:57.074]  And so much so, he was even, Ben Garrison even drew a picture of him.
[03:01:57.114 --> 03:02:01.577]  So that's how much Ben Garrison likes Stefan Molyneux.
[03:02:01.637 --> 03:02:02.997]  And we do have him right now.
[03:02:04.318 --> 03:02:09.181]  So, Stefan, do you agree with the New York Times that this is Donald Trump's last stand?
[03:02:09.201 --> 03:02:22.309]  Do you think the mainstream media and all those that are against him, the Republicans, the Democrats and everybody in between that don't want to see a guy bring term limits into politics, do you think they're going to win or do you think Trump is going to defeat them?
[03:02:25.905 --> 03:02:28.206]  I think it's important to be confident but not cocky.
[03:02:28.226 --> 03:02:30.126]  I always think that's a good frame of mind to be in.
[03:02:30.586 --> 03:02:36.148]  Because I'm sort of concerned if we say, oh, you know, Trump's totally gonna get it, he's got it in the bag, it's a done deal.
[03:02:36.188 --> 03:02:39.869]  Then people are like, eh, then why should I bother going to vote because it's a done deal and so on.
[03:02:40.709 --> 03:02:50.292]  And I think you want to be confident in that your action is going to make a difference, but not so cocky that you feel it's in the bag and don't need to work that hard because, you know, like all marathons.
[03:02:50.812 --> 03:02:56.214]  And Lord knows, doesn't this presidential race seem like a pretty 18-month-long marathon these days?
[03:02:56.534 --> 03:03:05.336]  But like all marathons, you save your energy, you marshal your resources for that last push, and of course that's where we are at the moment.
[03:03:05.376 --> 03:03:15.939]  So I'm confident, but that should not translate into any kind of laziness to anyone, but rather I think a renewed sense of urgency and dedication and hard work.
[03:03:16.738 --> 03:03:24.323]  Well, I've been stuck in this InfoWars bubble for the last two weeks, just concentrating on doing more things, shooting more videos, putting stuff out.
[03:03:25.484 --> 03:03:35.990]  Are you seeing any other alternative media outlets out there going like, we're just going to go live until the end of the election and cover this stuff live so we can decode the propaganda in real time?
[03:03:36.030 --> 03:03:37.231]  Is anybody else doing this out there?
[03:03:37.271 --> 03:03:37.791]  I don't even know.
[03:03:38.112 --> 03:03:39.352]  I'm in a bubble at this point.
[03:03:40.373 --> 03:03:44.817]  I don't think anyone's doing the kind of 50 plus hour push that you guys are doing.
[03:03:45.138 --> 03:03:54.447]  I do know, of course, that there are a lot of people out there putting a lot of time and energy and effort into this because, you know, it's important for people to remember this fundamentally is not about Donald Trump.
[03:03:54.847 --> 03:03:55.828]  It's about policies.
[03:03:56.289 --> 03:03:57.149]  It's about culture.
[03:03:57.249 --> 03:03:58.411]  It's about civilization.
[03:03:58.691 --> 03:04:01.694]  It's about the kind of direction that we want, not just America, but the West.
[03:04:02.134 --> 03:04:03.535]  As a whole, to go.
[03:04:03.615 --> 03:04:05.056]  Do we want to go more nanny state?
[03:04:05.076 --> 03:04:06.557]  Do we want to go more thought police?
[03:04:06.577 --> 03:04:08.719]  Do we want to go more language control?
[03:04:08.739 --> 03:04:09.980]  Do we want less free speech?
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:11.300]  Do we want more hysteria?
[03:04:11.641 --> 03:04:13.042]  Do we want weaker police?
[03:04:13.242 --> 03:04:17.185]  Or do we want greater liberties, keeping more of our money in our own pockets?
[03:04:17.265 --> 03:04:18.906]  Does America want jobs back?
[03:04:19.506 --> 03:04:23.049]  And so I think people of course on the left want you to focus on Donald Trump.
[03:04:23.669 --> 03:04:24.609]  Because that's just a man.
[03:04:24.949 --> 03:04:29.631]  But the man represents the will of the people, a huge section of the American population.
[03:04:30.131 --> 03:04:36.373]  And it's that will that can't be mocked by, you know, holding up someone to ridicule.
[03:04:36.433 --> 03:04:47.357]  So I think it is important to remember that Donald Trump, the person, can be a bit of a distraction from the movement of the people, which is where I think the real momentum and power is in this election cycle.
[03:04:47.901 --> 03:04:50.542]  And I think it was a continuation of the Ron Paul movement.
[03:04:50.622 --> 03:04:56.945]  You had a base of people who had seen, you know, Ron Paul just get trashed by the media, ignored essentially.
[03:04:57.325 --> 03:05:00.267]  You know, with Trump, they just call him out constantly on what he says.
[03:05:00.327 --> 03:05:01.307]  Oh, this is crazy, this is crazy.
[03:05:01.507 --> 03:05:03.048]  They would never even say what Ron Paul said.
[03:05:03.388 --> 03:05:10.631]  They would show election results from these primaries and they would go first place, second place, fourth and fifth and sixth.
[03:05:10.651 --> 03:05:11.672]  They wouldn't even show Ron Paul.
[03:05:12.529 --> 03:05:13.350]  And they just ignored him.
[03:05:13.370 --> 03:05:20.016]  They put him in the corner and he's such a gentleman he would never like come out and just like start taking it to the media like he should have.
[03:05:20.036 --> 03:05:26.262]  He was just very reserved and laid back and you get a complete opposite with Donald Trump but I think you get a lot of the same messages.
[03:05:27.703 --> 03:05:34.329]  Trump's are definitely not as finely tuned or as grounded as Ron Paul's is, but, you know, term limits.
[03:05:34.849 --> 03:05:43.477]  I mean, I think we can all agree, any just right-minded person or left-minded person, if you're a free-thinking individual, we can all agree that we need term limits.
[03:05:44.605 --> 03:05:46.566]  I think that's a reasonable stopgap measure.
[03:05:47.526 --> 03:05:58.229]  One of the problems is it can end up giving more power to the bureaucracy because even if you give term limits to the people at the front of government, there are people of course in the back rooms who are going to be there from here to eternity.
[03:05:58.609 --> 03:06:06.631]  The central issue, I would say, and I think most people who follow Ron Paul would agree with me on this, the central issue is we simply have
[03:06:07.051 --> 03:06:08.232]  To have a smaller government.
[03:06:08.252 --> 03:06:24.222]  We have to have less power for government to reward their friends and punish their enemies and hand out benefits and hand out preferential legislation and put tariffs up against your enemies and put taxes up against your enemies and give you subsidies and give you business and give you benefits and give you bonuses.
[03:06:24.663 --> 03:06:30.507]  As long as government has the power to redistribute these trillions of dollars at gunpoint throughout the economy, they will always
[03:06:31.167 --> 03:06:34.108]  be people trying to get in there and use that power for their own good.
[03:06:34.149 --> 03:06:36.630]  It's like this giant carcass of freedom by the side of the road.
[03:06:36.890 --> 03:06:43.233]  You can spend the rest of your life swatting the flies away, but at some point you're going to just have to clean it up and then you won't have to worry about the flies at all.
[03:06:43.853 --> 03:06:45.354]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[03:06:46.315 --> 03:06:46.795]  Well said.
[03:06:48.024 --> 03:06:51.648]  And going back to that, the picking winners and losers and taxing.
[03:06:52.408 --> 03:06:59.495]  I meet a lot of liberals, especially going out to these Trump rallies and the protesters, and you talk to them about taxes and taxation is theft.
[03:06:59.515 --> 03:07:00.476]  And they go, no it's not.
[03:07:00.817 --> 03:07:01.497]  It's not theft.
[03:07:02.198 --> 03:07:08.204]  They're so far removed from reality, they don't understand that if you don't pay your taxes, you will go to jail.
[03:07:09.224 --> 03:07:11.145]  Or you will have your money taken from you.
[03:07:11.626 --> 03:07:15.848]  And they don't seem to think that, see that as being force.
[03:07:16.389 --> 03:07:18.530]  They don't seem to equate that with force.
[03:07:19.050 --> 03:07:23.433]  But they go, you know, with the illegal immigrants, they go, but they want to be here.
[03:07:23.633 --> 03:07:24.133]  They want to be here.
[03:07:24.213 --> 03:07:28.076]  Well, you know, I don't want to pay my taxes all the time either, you know, but I still have to do it.
[03:07:30.216 --> 03:07:34.159]  You know, just because somebody wants to come here doesn't mean they have the right to come here.
[03:07:34.980 --> 03:07:39.424]  Especially come here and then suck off the system and then also vote.
[03:07:40.385 --> 03:07:44.768]  What's your reaction to the president saying, hey, you know, if you vote, you're a citizen?
[03:07:45.749 --> 03:07:48.992]  When asked about should illegals vote and will they be deported if they vote?
[03:07:49.636 --> 03:08:04.537]  Well, from an amoral, pragmatic standpoint, which is where the left has been operating from, I would say, since the 60s or the early 70s when the Soviet Empire collapsed and they lost all of their ideological rationale, all of their idealism, right?
[03:08:04.557 --> 03:08:05.639]  Because the left at one point
[03:08:05.979 --> 03:08:06.839]  were idealists.
[03:08:06.939 --> 03:08:20.883]  They thought that a stateless society would grow out of the communist dictatorship, and that the proletariat would be free, and the evil capitalists would be banished, and the evil monopoly guys with the monocle and so on would be sent off-planet.
[03:08:21.364 --> 03:08:29.466]  And so they had this idealism, horribly mistaken, with unbelievably disastrous 90 million dead plus results on the planet, but they had this idealism.
[03:08:30.327 --> 03:08:53.587]  Then in the 60s and the 70s, when it was revealed by Khrushchev after he talked about the cult of personality that Stalin had engendered and the Gulag Apokolago by Solzhenitsyn came out and the endless death camps and the murder squads and the starvation of the kulaks and of the Ukrainians in the 1930s, tens of millions of people killed through starvation policies and communism, they lost their idealism.
[03:08:54.427 --> 03:08:58.868]  And then it just became about naked power lust and base manipulation.
[03:08:58.928 --> 03:09:09.270]  So, of course, we all know, anybody with half a brain knows, that the people on the left, the Democrats, they don't care about immigrants fundamentally.
[03:09:09.290 --> 03:09:10.110]  They care about votes.
[03:09:10.630 --> 03:09:16.752]  And if they import immigrants from the third world, those immigrants will overwhelmingly vote for the left.
[03:09:18.052 --> 03:09:33.482]  Next up, Venezuela for everyone, which is, you know, when the train goes kind of off the cliff and it's a really slow demise down while you're trying to pluck seagulls out of the air to feed your gullet as you plunge down Thelma and Louise style into a chasm and a canyon of endless socialist tinkering and self-destruction.
[03:09:33.962 --> 03:09:37.965]  So they want to bring in immigrants who are going to vote for the left.
[03:09:38.425 --> 03:09:53.576]  And so from an amoral, powerless, pragmatic standpoint, like power at any price, regardless of standards or principles, legality, law, constitutionality, you name it, regardless of any moral restraint, he's doing the perfectly rational, albeit morally creepy-crawly thing.
[03:09:55.157 --> 03:09:57.059]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[03:09:57.139 --> 03:10:02.082]  And, you know, there were stories back when Argentina was going through an economic crisis where
[03:10:03.871 --> 03:10:08.875]  You know, trucks of cattle were being attacked and people were eating the cattle, just killing and eating it on the side of the road.
[03:10:09.155 --> 03:10:09.916]  You have the same thing.
[03:10:09.936 --> 03:10:18.022]  There are reports of chicken trucks being attacked and people just eating chickens, live chickens, on the side of the road because they're so freaking hungry.
[03:10:18.582 --> 03:10:24.447]  People are making nine-hour trips on a bus to go buy rice and beans and flying to the United States to get toilet paper.
[03:10:25.643 --> 03:10:28.405]  That's not a working system in any stretch of the means.
[03:10:28.425 --> 03:10:31.108]  There's no way you could say, oh, we got it all figured out.
[03:10:31.288 --> 03:10:34.310]  You know, and they, but, you know, they base their economy on one thing and that was oil.
[03:10:34.831 --> 03:10:39.114]  And when the prices dropped, you know, the bureaucrats didn't stop sucking.
[03:10:39.474 --> 03:10:42.337]  You know, they kept their, we're just going to keep taking what we want.
[03:10:42.897 --> 03:10:45.079]  And, oh, wait, there's no more money.
[03:10:45.960 --> 03:10:47.241]  We're going to cut electricity.
[03:10:47.301 --> 03:10:49.183]  We're going to stop food imports.
[03:10:49.223 --> 03:10:51.605]  We're going to stop, you know, Chavez don't provide the milk anymore.
[03:10:52.546 --> 03:10:53.327]  Like you used to.
[03:10:54.369 --> 03:10:57.795]  What do you see happening if Hillary Clinton does get in?
[03:10:57.875 --> 03:10:59.678]  What does her first hundred days look like?
[03:11:01.035 --> 03:11:03.196]  Well, it's the end of the Republic.
[03:11:03.516 --> 03:11:06.457]  I mean, I don't know any other way to put it.
[03:11:06.858 --> 03:11:09.539]  And this case has been made by a wide variety of people.
[03:11:10.019 --> 03:11:23.345]  But the case, very briefly, is this, that she's going to legalize tens of millions of illegal immigrants who are going to be an absolutely unstoppable, unblockable voting base for the left from here to eternity.
[03:11:23.485 --> 03:11:25.246]  And that means that you may end up
[03:11:25.766 --> 03:11:35.311]  With some vestigial remnant, you know, like I still have a little bit of a monkey tail, but you might end up with some vestigial remnant of the Republican Party in American politics.
[03:11:35.711 --> 03:11:41.514]  But all they will be is a sort of fig leaf to cover the endless predations of leftism.
[03:11:41.534 --> 03:11:42.854]  They will have to conform to the left.
[03:11:43.174 --> 03:11:46.936]  They will have to count out special interest groups among the illegal immigrants.
[03:11:47.477 --> 03:11:52.599]  And they may, as they have been doing for the last couple of decades, they may say to the Republican voters,
[03:11:52.699 --> 03:11:58.885]  Oh yes, you know, we're going to repeal Obamacare and we're going to cut back the government here and lower taxes there and simplify the code and all.
[03:11:59.206 --> 03:12:06.853]  But all that'll happen is that any Republicans who are still going to believe that stuff and after Trump and the way the Republican Party treated Trump, I don't think there'll be very many.
[03:12:07.394 --> 03:12:08.154]  All of those people.
[03:12:08.815 --> 03:12:15.679]  We'll end up voting for the Republicans and then the Republicans will end up betraying them to the dominant voting bloc.
[03:12:15.879 --> 03:12:20.922]  And we've seen, of course, this happen in Argentina and other places, right?
[03:12:20.962 --> 03:12:25.925]  Argentina in the Second World War had the same per capita income as America and was poised
[03:12:26.405 --> 03:12:31.068]  to be a free market economy, just as Chile managed to sort of survive its way through.
[03:12:31.708 --> 03:12:39.953]  Unlike Venezuela, Argentina was poised to become a sort of a first world in the third world and to follow America's growth pattern in the 1950s.
[03:12:40.333 --> 03:12:50.820]  Now, whether it was because, as the archetypal story goes, a whole bunch of Nazis fled there and set up national socialism there and infected the minds of people with various kinds of collectivism or whatever,
[03:12:51.420 --> 03:13:09.008]  But Argentina fell from its path and turned into the third world socialist central planning tiny group of elites huddled in their walled communities while people all outside all end up reusing underwear and picking through the garbage looking for non-too-flea infested rats to eat.
[03:13:09.468 --> 03:13:14.711]  That's where things go when you invite the third world into the first world with enough of a voting bloc
[03:13:15.131 --> 03:13:19.134]  That the third world ideas dominate the first world bureaucracies.
[03:13:19.714 --> 03:13:21.075]  Well, you end up with the third world.
[03:13:21.095 --> 03:13:29.560]  I mean, a culture can take a certain amount of enrichment by having other cultures come in, but you need to have time to blend.
[03:13:29.840 --> 03:13:36.584]  You know, if you add enough lemon to your bacon, you don't end up with lemon bacon, you just end up with lemon.
[03:13:37.284 --> 03:13:38.985]  And that, of course, is the problem.
[03:13:39.026 --> 03:13:42.768]  So to me, it will be the end of the two party system, which is already a big enough problem.
[03:13:43.328 --> 03:13:53.717]  But it certainly will be the end of any possibility of peacefully and legally rescuing the system from ever and ever bigger government control of the economy and of people's lives and thoughts and minds.
[03:13:54.778 --> 03:14:02.204]  Well, I tell ya, if we could get these words out to a hundred million people right now, maybe we could change some minds before... I'll say them louder!
[03:14:02.244 --> 03:14:02.865]  Say them louder.
[03:14:02.885 --> 03:14:03.145]  Okay!
[03:14:04.241 --> 03:14:05.302]  Socialism, bad!
[03:14:05.382 --> 03:14:06.862]  Free market, good!
[03:14:07.223 --> 03:14:08.303]  Scream it from the rooftop!
[03:14:08.323 --> 03:14:08.804]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:14:08.844 --> 03:14:10.304]  You know, it's amazing.
[03:14:10.344 --> 03:14:17.748]  Every time we run into these communists, we run into these communist groups out there and they're, oh, it's not the right type of socialism.
[03:14:17.788 --> 03:14:19.489]  It's not, that's not real communism.
[03:14:19.549 --> 03:14:23.732]  Real communism is this utopia where everybody gets along and everybody works together.
[03:14:24.552 --> 03:14:24.893]  No.
[03:14:26.014 --> 03:14:26.875]  You've seen it happen.
[03:14:26.915 --> 03:14:27.656]  It doesn't work.
[03:14:28.016 --> 03:14:29.978]  You can't force people to do stuff they don't want to do.
[03:14:30.659 --> 03:14:34.423]  And the only way you can force them is by killing them, and then they're not going to be around to do it.
[03:14:34.903 --> 03:14:46.616]  And then you're not going to have enough people to work, and the only ones that are there are the compliant ones who really don't have any skills, because the reason they're compliant is because they know that's the only way they're going to survive, and they don't have an independent bone in their body.
[03:14:47.176 --> 03:14:54.344]  So you're never going to get this communist utopia and capitalism isn't perfect and you can see how our system is gone is capitalism.
[03:14:54.404 --> 03:14:59.409]  It's crony capitalism and it doesn't work in a lot of areas but a lot of areas it does work.
[03:15:00.591 --> 03:15:02.873]  You know we're able to get on and do this stuff on the internet.
[03:15:03.033 --> 03:15:04.335]  If you have a really great idea
[03:15:05.373 --> 03:15:15.638]  Then what you should do is you should bring your great idea to the marketplace of ideas and convince other people how great your idea is and why they should adopt it.
[03:15:16.178 --> 03:15:31.026]  If you have an idea that you think is great, but you also believe can only be implemented by pointing the guns of the state at innocent, peaceful people in order to get them to bow down and scrape and obey the coerciveness of your great idea,
[03:15:32.133 --> 03:15:34.334]  That is not virtue, that is tyranny.
[03:15:34.694 --> 03:15:40.116]  I mean, if I want a woman to go out with me, I can go and ask her out, and thus she can say yes or she can say no.
[03:15:40.156 --> 03:15:48.600]  You know, maybe I'll spritz on a little aftershave and comb my tiny mohawk into something approximating a hairdo, but I have to go out and ask her now.
[03:15:48.980 --> 03:15:59.384]  If I go out with chloroform, a paper bag, or a potato sack, and then throw it into the back of a windowless van, I guess she's out with me, but it's not by choice and it's a crime.
[03:15:59.804 --> 03:16:03.947]  And so the problem is with people like Barack Obama who says, oh, I've got this great solution.
[03:16:03.967 --> 03:16:10.571]  I can cut a third or $3,000 a year from your health care costs.
[03:16:10.651 --> 03:16:11.131]  Well, great.
[03:16:11.171 --> 03:16:14.493]  Then go and start a company and offer that services.
[03:16:14.513 --> 03:16:20.317]  You'll out-compete everyone and you won't need all the guns in the universe pointed at people so that they conform to your idea.
[03:16:20.417 --> 03:16:23.659]  And this is why I don't think... If communists got this great idea, fantastic.
[03:16:24.039 --> 03:16:28.761]  If you want workers to make decisions about how a company works, fantastic!
[03:16:28.841 --> 03:16:31.263]  Go start that company and give your workers a say.
[03:16:31.503 --> 03:16:40.007]  But just stop pointing guns at the rest of us who are trying to get some stuff done that doesn't involve bowing down to the cordite smell of your personal integrity and virtue.
[03:16:41.226 --> 03:16:41.826]  Totally agree.
[03:16:41.866 --> 03:16:42.847]  You're on fire today.
[03:16:43.247 --> 03:16:44.248]  Let's go to some calls.
[03:16:44.288 --> 03:16:49.371]  We got Mike in Nevada who was at the Reno rally where the attacker was there.
[03:16:49.391 --> 03:16:51.572]  The first, you know, we were covering it live.
[03:16:51.592 --> 03:16:53.173]  We actually got a tweet about it.
[03:16:53.953 --> 03:16:58.676]  And the tweet said, you know, a guy with gun found in the crowd at a Trump rally.
[03:16:58.716 --> 03:17:00.817]  First of all, we're like, geez, how do you get a gun in there?
[03:17:00.877 --> 03:17:02.078]  First of all, that would be crazy.
[03:17:02.978 --> 03:17:03.899]  But we reported on it.
[03:17:04.379 --> 03:17:04.659]  And then
[03:17:05.760 --> 03:17:09.184]  You know, it turned out that the guy didn't have a gun, but they said, oh, Trump staged this.
[03:17:09.224 --> 03:17:09.944]  This is all Trump.
[03:17:09.984 --> 03:17:10.405]  He did it.
[03:17:10.465 --> 03:17:10.865]  He did it.
[03:17:11.526 --> 03:17:20.615]  And it comes out later, oh, it was a Democratic operative, and we've got him in strat for emails, and he's all over the place, known as being a Democratic operative, and he was there just to cause trouble.
[03:17:20.955 --> 03:17:23.298]  Mike, what did you see while you were there in Nevada?
[03:17:24.281 --> 03:17:25.882]  Well, what's going on, man?
[03:17:25.902 --> 03:17:27.083]  It's nice to talk to you.
[03:17:27.223 --> 03:17:32.627]  What I was witnessing was I was harassing CNN with my Bill Clinton as a rapist sign.
[03:17:33.028 --> 03:17:34.288]  I was just giving it to the media.
[03:17:34.328 --> 03:17:38.892]  My wife and the girls that she was with were in front of me, and they'd seen everything that broke out.
[03:17:39.532 --> 03:17:41.154]  And they said they'd seen a gun.
[03:17:41.214 --> 03:17:43.175]  My wife still swears to me when I talk to her.
[03:17:43.215 --> 03:17:44.496]  She swears she's seen a gun.
[03:17:44.716 --> 03:17:48.299]  And so I talked to other people outside the event.
[03:17:48.339 --> 03:17:49.219]  Yeah, I've seen something black.
[03:17:49.260 --> 03:17:50.020]  I've seen something black.
[03:17:50.040 --> 03:17:51.041]  You know, we were all screened.
[03:17:51.081 --> 03:17:52.482]  We were all screened for any kind of
[03:17:53.104 --> 03:17:55.605]  You know, we were screened by metal detectors.
[03:17:55.645 --> 03:17:57.826]  So I go outside, I start talking to people.
[03:17:57.946 --> 03:18:00.227]  Reno Police says, hey man, how does someone get a gun in here?
[03:18:00.647 --> 03:18:01.607]  I'm like, we were all screened.
[03:18:01.988 --> 03:18:10.931]  And he said, well, if someone walks out the exit and lets one of their friends in, and then, you know, so there could have been two people here, the gun could have been handed off to somebody else.
[03:18:11.211 --> 03:18:13.212]  I don't even think they would have told us there was a gun there.
[03:18:13.272 --> 03:18:15.193]  But the guy did get out of jail, obviously.
[03:18:15.213 --> 03:18:16.913]  But my question is, why isn't he on a 72-hour hold?
[03:18:18.590 --> 03:18:24.413]  When you go and try and disrupt and make a threat at a presidential candidate, if it was Hillary Clinton, the guy would be thrown under the tail.
[03:18:24.834 --> 03:18:25.714]  Yeah, I know, it's ridiculous.
[03:18:26.014 --> 03:18:26.495]  I'm scared that
[03:18:40.779 --> 03:18:43.460]  People just so, they don't even want to listen.
[03:18:43.480 --> 03:18:45.822]  I'm not in Reno, I'm in the Bay Area.
[03:18:45.842 --> 03:18:49.343]  I traveled from the Bay Area, the land of fruit and nuts, to go up and see Trump.
[03:18:49.363 --> 03:18:50.644]  Because I love Trump, we love Trump.
[03:18:52.585 --> 03:18:57.848]  I just don't understand why people can't see that we're about to lose something like these useful idiots that are voting for her.
[03:18:57.868 --> 03:19:01.369]  They're going to be feeling it too, you know?
[03:19:01.389 --> 03:19:02.690]  Make America Venezuela again.
[03:19:02.710 --> 03:19:03.330]  You know what's funny?
[03:19:03.350 --> 03:19:06.952]  I got a BBC reporter stuck a microphone in my face the other night.
[03:19:06.972 --> 03:19:08.273]  He was recording somebody.
[03:19:09.176 --> 03:19:10.779]  And I kept yelling, Bill Clinton is a racist!
[03:19:10.799 --> 03:19:15.225]  So, you know, after he interviews her, he's like, let me go over here and make this jerk off, um, you know, look stupid.
[03:19:15.265 --> 03:19:20.232]  Well, no, I owned his butt for about two or three minutes straight when the interview was over.
[03:19:21.074 --> 03:19:25.838]  Um, they both shook my hand and I said, you guys both know that'll never make it to your BBC website.
[03:19:25.878 --> 03:19:29.622]  You were hoping I was some schmendrick that was going to trip all over my words, but I just chewed you up.
[03:19:29.962 --> 03:19:30.983]  I went into Venezuela.
[03:19:31.023 --> 03:19:33.025]  I went into George Soros and the voting machines.
[03:19:33.105 --> 03:19:35.567]  I went into the food, drying up the food supply.
[03:19:35.587 --> 03:19:36.788]  I went into everything.
[03:19:37.128 --> 03:19:39.430]  And the guy was like, you know, what can you say?
[03:19:39.450 --> 03:19:40.511]  You're a BBC reporter.
[03:19:40.551 --> 03:19:43.654]  You were hoping that I was an idiot Trump supporter and you got owned.
[03:19:44.014 --> 03:19:49.037]  My wife took some photos and she recorded a little bit of it, but she didn't know how long they were going to ask questions.
[03:19:49.057 --> 03:19:51.599]  She didn't know if I was going to be a jerk to the guy, because I don't talk to media.
[03:19:52.179 --> 03:19:54.160]  But I just said, you know what, let me just chew this guy up.
[03:19:54.220 --> 03:19:55.141]  I drew a big crowd.
[03:19:55.161 --> 03:19:56.742]  It was awesome.
[03:19:56.922 --> 03:19:58.703]  But I still think that there's more to this.
[03:19:58.743 --> 03:20:00.104]  My wife was looking around today.
[03:20:00.744 --> 03:20:02.405]  This guy that got into the rally,
[03:20:02.970 --> 03:20:08.859]  He has some kind of ties back to the Guardian, where a Muslim reporter that they work together.
[03:20:08.879 --> 03:20:10.161]  I don't know, there's more to this.
[03:20:10.181 --> 03:20:15.408]  There needs to be something more looked into this whole thing with this guy, because he's got connections with a Muslim reporter that works for the Guardian.
[03:20:15.689 --> 03:20:17.732]  Supposedly his name's mentioned in the WikiLeaks.
[03:20:19.554 --> 03:20:20.936]  I saw his name mentioned in the WikiLeaks.
[03:20:21.056 --> 03:20:23.478]  It was in the Stratford releases, which was in 2014.
[03:20:35.672 --> 03:20:37.172]  It's Donald Trump's fault.
[03:20:37.332 --> 03:20:47.535]  Even though, of course, as we've seen from Project Veritas, the Democrats have been working to, as they say, bird dog, right, to provoke violence at Donald Trump rallies.
[03:20:47.575 --> 03:20:54.657]  So even when the Democrats pay homeless people to go out and start fights at Donald Trump rallies, it's Donald Trump's fault.
[03:20:54.737 --> 03:21:00.158]  So if you can see the pattern here, I think it's relatively clear that if it's a white male, you blame the victim.
[03:21:00.418 --> 03:21:02.039]  If it's everyone else, or anyone else,
[03:21:02.901 --> 03:21:03.742]  You blame the white man.
[03:21:03.882 --> 03:21:08.826]  And if you get video of him admitting it... Well, it's carefully edited video.
[03:21:08.846 --> 03:21:10.668]  It's not them admitting it.
[03:21:10.868 --> 03:21:11.849]  Go ahead, Mike.
[03:21:12.149 --> 03:21:12.629]  Hey, Rob.
[03:21:12.889 --> 03:21:13.150]  Yeah.
[03:21:13.190 --> 03:21:16.552]  So this guy was involved in the San Jose rally where it got really violent.
[03:21:16.632 --> 03:21:16.993]  It did.
[03:21:18.414 --> 03:21:20.376]  He got involved in another one in Florida, I guess.
[03:21:20.396 --> 03:21:21.196]  But he's been part of it.
[03:21:21.216 --> 03:21:22.257]  He's an operative.
[03:21:22.277 --> 03:21:23.118]  He's clearly an operative.
[03:21:23.538 --> 03:21:25.460]  I really think he was there to take a shot at him.
[03:21:26.464 --> 03:21:28.925]  I had this gut feeling the whole way up there that day.
[03:21:28.965 --> 03:21:30.545]  I just had this uneasy feeling.
[03:21:30.565 --> 03:21:32.146]  I was going to a Trump rally, and it's all love.
[03:21:32.186 --> 03:21:32.946]  I've been to them before.
[03:21:32.966 --> 03:21:35.387]  I just had this uneasy feeling the whole way up there.
[03:21:35.407 --> 03:21:36.307]  It was just very weird.
[03:21:36.587 --> 03:21:41.309]  I think there's something more sinister to this little event the other night, because it was an easy venue.
[03:21:41.349 --> 03:21:45.330]  It didn't seem like there was a ton of security there, and there was a ton of people there, you know?
[03:21:45.350 --> 03:21:50.111]  And the only hostilities in the whole thing was us harassing the media, because they're pieces of crap.
[03:21:50.551 --> 03:21:51.992]  But I don't know, man.
[03:21:52.012 --> 03:21:52.752]  Like I said, this is...
[03:21:53.373 --> 03:21:56.615]  These are some interesting times we live in and I appreciate you taking my call, man.
[03:21:56.995 --> 03:21:57.535]  Hey, real quick.
[03:21:57.575 --> 03:21:59.156]  How are you watching the show right now?
[03:22:00.096 --> 03:22:02.498]  I'm listening on my radio because I got work to do around the house.
[03:22:02.518 --> 03:22:03.158]  I just listen.
[03:22:03.218 --> 03:22:04.038]  I'm not even watching.
[03:22:04.258 --> 03:22:06.780]  So it's terrestrial radio right now?
[03:22:07.100 --> 03:22:07.860]  No, it's through the app.
[03:22:08.060 --> 03:22:08.701]  Our app.
[03:22:08.761 --> 03:22:09.001]  Great.
[03:22:09.101 --> 03:22:09.301]  Okay.
[03:22:09.341 --> 03:22:10.381]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[03:22:10.421 --> 03:22:16.284]  I just want to know how people are catching the stream because we got a Facebook stream, two YouTube streams going out.
[03:22:16.745 --> 03:22:18.165]  Other people are picking it up on YouTube.
[03:22:18.586 --> 03:22:21.247]  I think it's great just to hear how people are getting the information.
[03:22:22.396 --> 03:22:25.300]  If I sit on my butt and watch things, I don't get nothing done.
[03:22:25.340 --> 03:22:30.687]  So this way I can get something done, get educated, learn how to school BBC reporters and, you know, stay functional.
[03:22:30.908 --> 03:22:31.328]  There you go.
[03:22:31.348 --> 03:22:32.730]  Alright, Mike, thanks for calling.
[03:22:32.750 --> 03:22:33.371]  Appreciate it.
[03:22:33.611 --> 03:22:33.851]  Thanks.
[03:22:34.913 --> 03:22:37.877]  You got any comments on that before we go to the next caller?
[03:22:39.053 --> 03:22:41.173]  Well, I do think that words matter.
[03:22:41.494 --> 03:22:43.094]  And I do think that language matters.
[03:22:43.294 --> 03:22:51.596]  And one of the things that I think people need to recognize is that the escalation of rhetoric from the left is going to have consequences one way or another.
[03:22:51.636 --> 03:23:05.759]  There's only so many times you can say that somebody is literally the reincarnation and embodiment of Adolf Hitler before some crazy people out there are going to get those radio waves of repetition stuck deep into their brain and think, well, I've got to save civilization.
[03:23:06.039 --> 03:23:06.740]  He's Hitler.
[03:23:06.960 --> 03:23:08.380]  These are terrible things they're going to have.
[03:23:08.880 --> 03:23:13.142]  You know, I mean, and this is part of the noxious fumes of destructive language.
[03:23:13.222 --> 03:23:18.223]  It's not the same exactly as crying fire in a crowded theater, but to me it's not that far off.
[03:23:18.464 --> 03:23:24.506]  When you keep painting somebody as the embodiment of evil and hatefulness and sexism and racism and destructiveness and so on,
[03:23:25.146 --> 03:23:29.889]  You kind of are priming the pump for crazy people to start to take actions into their own hands.
[03:23:30.029 --> 03:23:36.253]  And then, of course, the horrible thing is that they always say, well, you know, we're not going to stoop to the level of the Democrats, or the Republicans, rather.
[03:23:36.273 --> 03:23:37.414]  We're going to take the high road.
[03:23:37.434 --> 03:23:39.155]  We're not going to go down there in the mud.
[03:23:39.195 --> 03:23:43.858]  It's like, man, if you Democrats could get up out of the mud, I don't even know if we'd recognize you.
[03:23:44.398 --> 03:23:45.840]  Right, let's have a level playing field.
[03:23:45.860 --> 03:23:49.205]  Let's not have questions before the debates.
[03:23:49.305 --> 03:23:53.591]  Let's not have questions fed from the DNC and White House to CNN.
[03:23:53.932 --> 03:23:55.194]  Let's just do it on a level playing field.
[03:23:55.214 --> 03:24:00.201]  Let's see if, like you said, if your ideas are good enough, people will like them and people will go, yes, we like your ideas.
[03:24:00.501 --> 03:24:13.249]  But if your ideas are only, he's a bad guy, he said bad things, here I am with my rappers and my hoes, you know, on stage, but there's no hypocrite stance, there's no double standard, it's ridiculous.
[03:24:13.729 --> 03:24:17.191]  Let's go to James in South Carolina.
[03:24:17.211 --> 03:24:20.053]  He has comments on Larry Nichols.
[03:24:20.073 --> 03:24:20.653]  Go ahead, James.
[03:24:21.173 --> 03:24:22.354]  And how are you listening to us first?
[03:24:23.035 --> 03:24:23.455]  Or watching?
[03:24:23.891 --> 03:24:24.874]  Well, I'm a member.
[03:24:25.214 --> 03:24:26.297]  I'm a subscriber.
[03:24:26.357 --> 03:24:27.500]  Prison Planet, alright.
[03:24:27.801 --> 03:24:28.362]  Thank you.
[03:24:28.503 --> 03:24:30.487]  My computer's messed up, so I'm actually...
[03:24:31.264 --> 03:24:34.386]  I've gotten my PS4 back from the kids temporarily.
[03:24:35.126 --> 03:24:36.547]  Ah, for 52 hours, huh?
[03:24:36.607 --> 03:24:37.628]  That's good.
[03:24:37.688 --> 03:24:38.688]  Yeah, well, yeah.
[03:24:38.709 --> 03:24:43.431]  You can tell them that you're playing a slightly more important game at the moment than anything they could get their hands into.
[03:24:43.711 --> 03:24:47.494]  Oh, well, I'm an everyday viewer, so my kids, they love Alex.
[03:24:47.934 --> 03:24:48.154]  Excellent.
[03:24:48.194 --> 03:24:51.156]  All they do is ask me when his son's gonna do more reports.
[03:24:51.456 --> 03:24:52.517]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[03:24:53.297 --> 03:24:56.239]  Anyways, to Larry Nichols, boy, what a home run.
[03:24:56.619 --> 03:24:56.879]  I know.
[03:24:57.480 --> 03:24:58.220]  He's on fire.
[03:24:58.540 --> 03:25:01.682]  You know, there's some times where I go, God, Larry can't be right on that.
[03:25:01.763 --> 03:25:02.523]  How does he know that?
[03:25:02.583 --> 03:25:04.324]  He's just in Arkansas.
[03:25:04.424 --> 03:25:05.605]  He knows it because he's seen it.
[03:25:05.785 --> 03:25:06.586]  He's seen all the tricks.
[03:25:06.686 --> 03:25:07.346]  He knows what they are.
[03:25:07.406 --> 03:25:07.746]  He knows them.
[03:25:08.027 --> 03:25:08.827]  He has the playbook.
[03:25:09.508 --> 03:25:16.092]  Well, I had no doubt that he was an insider back then, but you know, times change, people change.
[03:25:16.392 --> 03:25:18.153]  You would assume tactics would change.
[03:25:18.714 --> 03:25:20.395]  That being said, if you look back,
[03:25:21.138 --> 03:25:26.861]  I'd say three or four months ago, I actually called in and I talked with Alex while Nichols was on.
[03:25:26.941 --> 03:25:27.901]  Alex gave me a shirt.
[03:25:28.581 --> 03:25:41.347]  But anyways, that day, Nichols was saying to be careful about the health issues, that one of her biggest tactics was to become the underdog.
[03:25:42.040 --> 03:25:45.102]  And in some way, launch herself out of it at the very end.
[03:25:45.823 --> 03:25:51.867]  I mean, almost verbatim, he said that, you know, saying, use caution going after Hillary about her health.
[03:25:52.587 --> 03:25:58.071]  Well, I don't think she foresaw the 650,000 emails coming out.
[03:25:58.171 --> 03:26:06.557]  However, it gave them this golden opportunity since it's, you know, it's already out on WikiLeaks.
[03:26:06.577 --> 03:26:08.018]  Now they're doing this.
[03:26:08.278 --> 03:26:11.060]  So who's to say she didn't get Comey?
[03:26:12.037 --> 03:26:22.259]  To come out and say, oh, we're doing this, you know, and then two days before the election, just like Nichols suggested, here they've just dropped the ball on the whole thing.
[03:26:23.219 --> 03:26:27.300]  Yeah, I'm pretty amazed that they could go through 650,000 emails in eight days.
[03:26:27.320 --> 03:26:28.641]  Stephan, what do you make of that?
[03:26:29.461 --> 03:26:36.802]  Well, here's the thing I think that's important about Hillary's health, and of course nobody knows, I mean, other than her inner circle, her doctor and so on, what's really going on with her health.
[03:26:37.262 --> 03:26:39.623]  But this is what I would ask, a basic sort of question.
[03:26:40.672 --> 03:27:04.567]  If you are questioned by the FBI regarding your use of an internal or domestic email server, bypassing all of the security and protections and expertise of your .gov servers and so on, if the FBI sits you down and asks you a whole lot of questions about why you did what you did, and you say to the FBI repeatedly, I hit my head, it was really bad,
[03:27:05.507 --> 03:27:06.288]  I can't remember.
[03:27:06.568 --> 03:27:06.848]  Okay.
[03:27:07.449 --> 03:27:20.181]  So maybe that gets you off the hook with the FBI, although there are reports that the FBI agents who were interviewing her wanted her medical records because they did not believe that her head injury was that bad, or at least they had some questions that needed to be answered.
[03:27:20.201 --> 03:27:21.222]  They wanted her medical records.
[03:27:21.242 --> 03:27:23.204]  They went to Comey and said, can we get her medical records?
[03:27:23.244 --> 03:27:23.565]  He said no.
[03:27:24.428 --> 03:27:39.357]  Okay, so if that's your excuse to the FBI that you hit your head so badly that you can't remember very, very important things, I think that's kind of relevant to whether or not you should be given the nuclear codes, to whether you should be put in charge of the largest army in the world and the most powerful government in the world.
[03:27:39.418 --> 03:27:40.778]  That seems to me kind of important.
[03:27:40.818 --> 03:27:45.882]  So if you're going to use your health as an excuse as to why you can't remember things with regards to the FBI,
[03:27:46.582 --> 03:27:50.392]  I think it's pretty reasonable for voters to then say, okay, come on, pony up.
[03:27:50.473 --> 03:27:55.185]  If you're going to use this as an excuse, we better find out what the heck is going on with your health.
[03:27:56.075 --> 03:28:01.880]  I think that, and when you see him throw her into her van on 9-11, that really calls into question, because that was not supposed to be seen.
[03:28:02.260 --> 03:28:06.564]  And it's funny that it was a Democrat supporter that shot that video and put it up.
[03:28:06.604 --> 03:28:07.945]  He's actually a fan of Hillary Clinton.
[03:28:08.365 --> 03:28:11.568]  Probably didn't know she was going to shamble into that van like that.
[03:28:11.808 --> 03:28:18.454]  And that really, I think, pulled the lid off that fallacy that, oh, she's fine, she's fine, everything's fine, everything's fine.
[03:28:18.474 --> 03:28:19.755]  Why are you questioning her health?
[03:28:19.775 --> 03:28:21.397]  You're so mean, so sexist.
[03:28:22.430 --> 03:28:23.410]  James, thanks for calling.
[03:28:23.510 --> 03:28:32.572]  There is also, I think, something that is important to remember that the presidential campaign, I can imagine, is an exhausting and stressful time.
[03:28:32.612 --> 03:28:42.055]  I mean, hell, it can be tiring just covering the damn thing, let alone being in it and doing, well, I guess Donald Trump's kind of work ethic is something nothing short of Prussian.
[03:28:42.095 --> 03:28:51.157]  But, you know, even when she can sort of rouse herself off of her cot and get out into the public like Hillary Clinton does once every couple of days, it's a lot of stress and it's a lot of work.
[03:28:52.150 --> 03:29:01.578]  That's of course when you're hungry for power and want to become president and the whole party's invested in you and even pulled some not so honest levers to get you to bypass Bernie Sanders and get to the front of the line.
[03:29:02.559 --> 03:29:16.231]  But remember everyone, Hillary Clinton knows for sure, and Donald Trump I believe is really going to keep his word with regards to this, but Hillary Clinton knows for a basic fact that if she loses this presidential election,
[03:29:17.412 --> 03:29:18.634]  She's going to get investigated.
[03:29:35.012 --> 03:29:41.794]  Thought that they were pursuing, thought they had in the bag, thought they had her dead to rights and were incredibly frustrated at the way it played out under Comey's watch.
[03:29:41.874 --> 03:29:43.855]  So I think you're going to get a real investigation.
[03:29:44.275 --> 03:29:46.395]  It's not going to be somebody with ties to the Clintons.
[03:29:46.476 --> 03:29:54.418]  It's going to be somebody like Giuliani who's going to be deciding whether they're going to be search warrants, whether there's going to be a grand jury participation in the FBI investigation.
[03:29:54.758 --> 03:30:04.281]  So it's not just that you really, really want to become president, but you know, if it doesn't work out, you can write some memoirs, you can go on some speaking tours, you can set up a presidential library and take a painting.
[03:30:04.801 --> 03:30:05.141]  No, no.
[03:30:05.502 --> 03:30:17.253]  If she loses, the entire resources of the Justice Department and the FBI and I think whoever else can be thrown at her under a Trump administration are going to have her squarely in their sights.
[03:30:17.613 --> 03:30:29.384]  And I've had Charles Altel, a specialist who's been disassembling the complex, sticky bureaucratic web of the Clinton Foundation and has found stuff that he perceives to be completely illegal.
[03:30:30.084 --> 03:30:33.707]  And that's not an intent-based investigation as far as I know.
[03:30:34.188 --> 03:30:45.377]  So she is looking not just to get into a boat because she's tired of swimming, she's looking to get into a boat because she's being pursued by a fairly blondish shark that has her in its sights.
[03:30:45.397 --> 03:30:51.683]  So that kind of stress, I could see it's a pretty high-stakes game and I could see that wearing a body down after a while.
[03:30:52.063 --> 03:30:56.847]  And there's no excuse, and I agree with you on that, there's no excuse for
[03:30:57.848 --> 03:30:59.849]  Anybody out there to say, well, she's Hillary Clinton.
[03:30:59.889 --> 03:31:02.511]  She had to do these things in order to get her agenda through.
[03:31:02.691 --> 03:31:04.753]  No, you can't have secret servers.
[03:31:05.213 --> 03:31:08.035]  You can't destroy evidence after it's subpoenaed.
[03:31:08.996 --> 03:31:11.437]  You can't have your maid print out your top secret emails.
[03:31:12.918 --> 03:31:15.680]  You can't funnel money through the Clinton Foundation.
[03:31:16.260 --> 03:31:17.521]  And that's exactly what it was.
[03:31:17.581 --> 03:31:18.382]  It was a whole scheme.
[03:31:18.402 --> 03:31:20.063]  There's so many crimes going on.
[03:31:20.083 --> 03:31:21.224]  But that's the whole question, right?
[03:31:21.444 --> 03:31:21.984]  Or can you?
[03:31:22.424 --> 03:31:26.087]  That's the big question that hangs in front of the American public right now.
[03:31:26.427 --> 03:31:27.468]  You can't do these things.
[03:31:28.549 --> 03:31:29.970]  Unless you're Hillary Clinton.
[03:31:29.990 --> 03:31:31.311]  That's the big fork in the road.
[03:31:31.331 --> 03:31:36.575]  Are you going to have a rule of law or are you going to have a rule of charisma and money and under shady dealings in power?
[03:31:36.675 --> 03:31:37.596]  That is the question.
[03:31:38.036 --> 03:31:53.208]  I mean, we've got a population, right, where 83% of Americans who were appalled recently say that they genuinely believe, deep in their heart of hearts, that Hillary Clinton did something or some things that were either illegal or unethical.
[03:31:53.448 --> 03:31:53.608]  That's 83%.
[03:31:56.499 --> 03:32:01.722]  That, of course, is only 17% who either don't know or say, nope, think she's completely on the up and up.
[03:32:02.503 --> 03:32:09.727]  How on earth can you have a viable presidential candidacy when 83% of the population think you did something illegal or unethical?
[03:32:09.767 --> 03:32:18.392]  Because she has a support base of much more than 17%, which means, of course, with that overlap, as you know, there are a lot of people who think she did something really illegal or unethical.
[03:32:19.087 --> 03:32:25.977]  But they're going to vote for her anyway, which means that there's been a complete uncoupling of basic moral standards from voting.
[03:32:26.397 --> 03:32:27.519]  So what are they voting for?
[03:32:27.979 --> 03:32:28.921]  It's not for morality.
[03:32:29.041 --> 03:32:29.962]  It's not for integrity.
[03:32:30.002 --> 03:32:30.803]  It's not for virtue.
[03:32:30.863 --> 03:32:32.606]  It's not for any kind of ethical standards.
[03:32:33.046 --> 03:32:34.068]  What are they voting for?
[03:32:34.468 --> 03:32:35.790]  They're voting, I believe,
[03:32:36.351 --> 03:32:36.912]  For free stuff.
[03:32:54.614 --> 03:32:55.835]  You had to be a property owner.
[03:32:56.376 --> 03:32:59.338]  You had to have a sort of minimum income in order to vote.
[03:32:59.418 --> 03:33:05.543]  Because the argument back in the 19th century would say, OK, well, if you give universal suffrage, if everyone gets to vote, well, the poor outnumber the rich.
[03:33:05.904 --> 03:33:10.768]  So the poor will vote to take away the property of the rich and everybody gets to be poor.
[03:33:11.268 --> 03:33:12.590]  And that is a huge problem.
[03:33:12.670 --> 03:33:16.233]  Is there a conflict of interest if you are on the receiving end of government largesse?
[03:33:16.273 --> 03:33:20.957]  Can you make objective decisions based upon honor and virtue and integrity?
[03:33:21.497 --> 03:33:26.101]  If you're on the receiving end of government money, can you make objective decisions about taxation and spending?
[03:33:26.942 --> 03:33:29.024]  That's called conflict of interest in the private sector.
[03:33:29.244 --> 03:33:32.827]  It seems to be just called voting, at least on the left, in the public sector these days.
[03:33:32.907 --> 03:33:44.277]  And I think we should, again, if we can shrink the amount of size and power of the state, then people can begin voting again based on principles and issues rather on, ka-ching, ka-ching, I want my free government cheddar in a wheelbarrow.
[03:33:44.628 --> 03:33:52.933]  And people don't realize when you unleash the economic binders that are on us right now, you're going to have more money than you know what to do with.
[03:33:53.013 --> 03:33:57.716]  You're going to have those openings and just be able to fulfill your dreams.
[03:33:58.137 --> 03:34:00.258]  You're not going to be able to do it in a Hillary Clinton presidency.
[03:34:00.578 --> 03:34:01.499]  You're going to be taxed.
[03:34:02.259 --> 03:34:03.860]  There's going to be regulations on everything.
[03:34:04.020 --> 03:34:09.642]  Only giant corporations are going to be able to succeed because anybody getting into the game is going to be regulated to death.
[03:34:09.902 --> 03:34:12.103]  And the big boys don't have to follow those regulations.
[03:34:12.163 --> 03:34:17.005]  Let's go to, I guess our next caller is Scott in Arizona.
[03:34:17.045 --> 03:34:22.848]  He wants to question Stefan on the Podesta revelations and possible false flags.
[03:34:23.448 --> 03:34:24.828]  Is spirit cooking a false flag?
[03:34:25.229 --> 03:34:25.869]  Go ahead, Scott.
[03:34:26.932 --> 03:34:27.472]  Right, right.
[03:34:27.953 --> 03:34:29.233]  So, hey, let me just start and say it.
[03:34:29.393 --> 03:34:30.274]  I love InfoWars.
[03:34:30.534 --> 03:34:32.395]  Rob, thank you for having Stefan on.
[03:34:33.296 --> 03:34:35.157]  Thanks, Alex, for having him on.
[03:34:35.217 --> 03:34:36.778]  And Stefan, thanks for all you do, man.
[03:34:36.798 --> 03:34:38.599]  You've really changed my life and helped a lot of people.
[03:34:39.279 --> 03:34:40.420]  Thank you.
[03:34:40.860 --> 03:34:41.160]  You bet.
[03:34:41.200 --> 03:34:43.602]  So, let me just back up a little bit.
[03:34:44.342 --> 03:34:50.506]  You know, a lot of the things that are coming out in these Podesta emails, normal-minded thinking people, whatever that is,
[03:34:51.212 --> 03:34:52.413]  I can't believe what they're seeing.
[03:34:52.613 --> 03:34:56.035]  So a lot of them are refusing to even believe what's in these, you know, WikiLeaks.
[03:34:56.535 --> 03:34:59.357]  I think Donna Brazile said she won't even look at them.
[03:35:01.038 --> 03:35:09.623]  The revelation of the spirit cooking and a lot of this strange talk in there is shocking a lot of people and making them realize that we don't know who these people are.
[03:35:09.663 --> 03:35:12.284]  They're a lot darker than a lot of us ever thought.
[03:35:13.645 --> 03:35:16.807]  That said, my question is, are they dark enough to
[03:35:17.600 --> 03:35:18.441]  We're good to go.
[03:35:31.778 --> 03:35:36.362]  Well, you've said a lot, so let me just sort of skim past these topics and satisfy no one on any of them.
[03:35:36.802 --> 03:35:39.965]  You know, you can always ask me in more detail.
[03:35:40.565 --> 03:35:46.410]  So with regards to the Podesta stuff, there are of course questions around what was going on at the Spirit Cooking Dinner.
[03:35:46.430 --> 03:35:48.072]  Of course, we'll never know for sure.
[03:35:48.152 --> 03:35:49.053]  It doesn't seem like a very...
[03:35:49.813 --> 03:35:55.238]  Honest group of individuals as a whole, so I don't know if we'd ever really know for sure what happened there.
[03:35:55.818 --> 03:36:02.143]  But I will say this, and this is just sort of my personal perspective and my personal opinion, that this stuff is weird.
[03:36:02.744 --> 03:36:06.326]  And it's not weird like, oh, that's a little unusual or a tiny bit unsettling.
[03:36:06.487 --> 03:36:14.913]  It's like stomach-churningly awful weird, like disturbing, sick, strange, dysfunctional,
[03:36:15.774 --> 03:36:20.637]  Yeah, like get me out of here and scrub me down with a loofah and dettol kind of strange.
[03:36:20.697 --> 03:36:33.385]  And so having these people sort of floating around the corridors of power, yeah, let's just go for dinner with this woman, you know, who pours blood on effigies and has snakes hanging off her face and poses on skulls.
[03:36:33.505 --> 03:36:35.446]  And I mean, yeah, that sounds great.
[03:36:35.466 --> 03:36:39.709]  You know, I guess, you know, I guess Pablo Picasso was kind of busy.
[03:36:39.749 --> 03:36:42.031]  So let's just go over to this freak's house for dinner.
[03:36:42.731 --> 03:36:43.271]  That is weird.
[03:36:43.532 --> 03:36:57.562]  If you want to look at John Podesta's Brothers art, which you can sort of find on the internet for reasons I can't quite figure out, but there it is, it's weird and disturbing and dark and nasty in many ways.
[03:36:57.602 --> 03:37:04.707]  Now, of course, I don't know what all of this, you know, pizza and dominoes and handkerchief with black, I don't know.
[03:37:04.767 --> 03:37:10.291]  There's some theories and I've read them, but I obviously can't figure out for sure what any of that stuff means in any kind of detail.
[03:37:11.428 --> 03:37:14.752]  But it makes me concerned.
[03:37:14.772 --> 03:37:18.497]  I'd like to know, even though it would be horrible to know, I would like to know.
[03:37:18.577 --> 03:37:26.327]  And we may never know, of course, although I'm sure if Trump gets in, I think some very bright lights are going to be shone into some very dark corners.
[03:37:28.528 --> 03:37:37.875]  The accusations of rape against Bill Clinton, the fact that he settled with Paula Jones for $650,000 for harassment and so on, these are some pretty dark claims.
[03:37:38.256 --> 03:37:42.579]  And of course, Hillary Clinton is accused of attacking the women who accused her husband.
[03:37:42.619 --> 03:37:44.000]  Hey, Stefan, hold that thought real quick.
[03:37:44.100 --> 03:37:46.002]  Alex Jones just entered into the studio.
[03:37:46.042 --> 03:37:47.163]  He took a little break for a little while.
[03:37:47.183 --> 03:37:48.704]  He's coming on in about 30 minutes.
[03:37:48.724 --> 03:37:49.264]  Go ahead, Alex.
[03:37:49.464 --> 03:37:49.765]  That's right.
[03:37:49.785 --> 03:37:51.906]  I want to interview Stefan because he's on a roll here.
[03:37:51.926 --> 03:37:53.768]  What a great patriot for humanity.
[03:37:55.689 --> 03:38:01.113]  I have been talking to little birdies, and let me tell you, they've always been very pessimistic.
[03:38:02.094 --> 03:38:05.136]  And then I called Roger Stone, who's flying in in the morning.
[03:38:05.657 --> 03:38:08.579]  He'll be here at least two days for the big election, and he'll be here at 11 tomorrow.
[03:38:10.216 --> 03:38:14.217]  And let me tell you, we can now say this because they've made a big deal about the campaign, but he is like a big part of the brains.
[03:38:14.237 --> 03:38:16.218]  He's one of the only people that actually challenges Trump.
[03:38:17.278 --> 03:38:22.580]  And they're confidants, they've been friends for 40 years, kind of his wingman when he's, I've been married and stuff, but they're very close.
[03:38:23.381 --> 03:38:25.101]  I called Stone to confirm this.
[03:38:25.882 --> 03:38:28.382]  I said, why is Hillary canceling the fireworks display?
[03:38:28.422 --> 03:38:29.203]  Why is all this happening?
[03:38:30.263 --> 03:38:32.644]  And we also see the numbers already out in the polls that are on DrudgeReport.com.
[03:38:32.664 --> 03:38:35.065]  I'm going to get out of here in a minute and let Stefan continue.
[03:38:36.058 --> 03:38:41.670]  I was just given the numbers, and Stone has agreed to come on, on the polling agencies he's involved with.
[03:38:42.773 --> 03:38:46.841]  One's liberal, one's conservative, one just does scientific stuff, but they're all very scientific.
[03:38:48.234 --> 03:38:48.354]  That's
[03:39:07.807 --> 03:39:09.927]  You know, independents, conservatives, liberals, you name it.
[03:39:10.248 --> 03:39:11.408]  People that have done early voting.
[03:39:11.968 --> 03:39:19.710]  And whether it's Florida or Ohio or New York or Pennsylvania, and even New York, unless there's fraud, Trump's ahead a few points there.
[03:39:19.750 --> 03:39:21.790]  Other states it's like 10%, 5%, 8%, 6%.
[03:39:23.691 --> 03:39:25.471]  The good news is, folks, these are scientific polls.
[03:39:25.491 --> 03:39:26.411]  This isn't wishful thinking.
[03:39:27.632 --> 03:39:28.712]  These are scientific polls.
[03:39:30.199 --> 03:39:33.860]  They even have a margin of error on average of like 7% more Democrats because there are more Democrats.
[03:39:34.260 --> 03:39:35.560]  They overdo that with 12, 15, 20.
[03:39:36.480 --> 03:39:41.662]  Donald Trump is having a total landslide and the momentum by the hour here at the end is for him.
[03:39:41.722 --> 03:39:42.982]  It's been like that the last week.
[03:39:43.142 --> 03:39:44.262]  Yeah, it has.
[03:39:44.562 --> 03:39:49.463]  And so, barring major election fraud, Donald Trump's the next president of the United States.
[03:39:49.483 --> 03:39:51.344]  We'll have our work cut out for us.
[03:39:51.384 --> 03:39:52.024]  He's not perfect.
[03:39:52.064 --> 03:39:52.604]  None of us are.
[03:39:52.904 --> 03:39:54.524]  We're a very domesticated population.
[03:39:55.625 --> 03:39:56.705]  We're hooked on the tit of
[03:39:57.745 --> 03:39:58.685]  Crony capitalism.
[03:39:59.205 --> 03:40:01.166]  But Hillary and the globalists are out to get us.
[03:40:01.186 --> 03:40:02.186]  This is a make or break a deal.
[03:40:02.446 --> 03:40:03.006]  Here's the problem.
[03:40:03.286 --> 03:40:04.147]  They've rigged the polls.
[03:40:04.447 --> 03:40:05.427]  They've rigged the elections.
[03:40:05.807 --> 03:40:07.907]  They've rigged the questions.
[03:40:08.127 --> 03:40:08.988]  WikiLeaks proves that.
[03:40:09.028 --> 03:40:10.868]  So, don't think we're out of the woods.
[03:40:11.128 --> 03:40:11.808]  You gotta go vote.
[03:40:12.188 --> 03:40:13.569]  If you haven't voted, you gotta go vote.
[03:40:13.589 --> 03:40:15.249]  Well, exactly, because they can't beat a tsunami.
[03:40:15.289 --> 03:40:17.690]  And let me tell you, this is way bigger than Reagan's victory.
[03:40:17.710 --> 03:40:22.451]  I'm just telling you right now, the reason she's in six blue states, they keep going, why is she in blue states?
[03:40:23.291 --> 03:40:24.891]  Because they're not blue states, folks.
[03:40:24.931 --> 03:40:26.332]  This is a collapse.
[03:40:26.712 --> 03:40:29.353]  If a Republican was in right now doing this, he'd be a Democrat winning.
[03:40:29.753 --> 03:40:30.893]  This is a repudiation.
[03:40:30.953 --> 03:40:35.654]  Donald Trump isn't even the equation, except he had the will to be politically incorrect and not be bullied.
[03:40:35.674 --> 03:40:37.715]  Back to you and Stefan Molyneux.
[03:40:37.995 --> 03:40:39.235]  Stone is on concurring.
[03:40:39.255 --> 03:40:40.536]  My goodness, this is from Stone.
[03:40:40.556 --> 03:40:41.496]  He's usually a big pessimist.
[03:40:41.996 --> 03:40:45.117]  Stone is... He's been very conservative every time you ask him that question.
[03:40:45.137 --> 03:40:46.577]  Well, I talked to him for 20 minutes driving back home.
[03:40:46.937 --> 03:40:47.777]  He was in ecstasy.
[03:40:48.158 --> 03:40:49.118]  But back to Stefan Molyneux.
[03:40:49.278 --> 03:40:49.518]  Dang.
[03:40:50.049 --> 03:40:50.309]  Wow.
[03:40:50.409 --> 03:40:57.592]  Alex, I'm completely shocked that you have interrupted my ramblings with something so unimportant as who's going to be the next president of the United... I'm personally offended!
[03:40:57.652 --> 03:40:58.332]  I can't believe it!
[03:40:58.452 --> 03:40:58.892]  I'm leaving.
[03:41:00.653 --> 03:41:04.015]  No, that's... and I have been... Well, we can't celebrate like you said earlier.
[03:41:04.655 --> 03:41:05.515]  You don't want to be cocky.
[03:41:05.595 --> 03:41:06.255]  Be careful, you know?
[03:41:06.275 --> 03:41:07.196]  We have to vote.
[03:41:07.236 --> 03:41:08.676]  You can't just sit on your laurels.
[03:41:08.736 --> 03:41:11.237]  I'm actually... I'm on from 6 to 8 tomorrow in the a.m.
[03:41:11.718 --> 03:41:12.478]  and then I'm going to vote.
[03:41:13.815 --> 03:41:23.044]  Yes, and I have of course heard, and I've been very cautious and conservative about what's going on with the election.
[03:41:23.064 --> 03:41:27.948]  I have sources who have told me that it's going to be a pretty significant victory for Donald Trump.
[03:41:27.988 --> 03:41:29.430]  I've been very hesitant to talk about it.
[03:41:29.870 --> 03:41:38.800]  Because the last thing that I would want is for anyone to take something like that for granted and have it slip away or have enough of a lead slip back that fraud might be an issue.
[03:41:38.861 --> 03:41:46.549]  If there's a big enough lead, I mean, if the kind of numbers that Alex is talking about are what is going on, then fraud, I believe, becomes virtually impossible.
[03:41:46.589 --> 03:41:48.071]  You can't jig it by that much.
[03:41:48.111 --> 03:41:50.153]  You can sort of move the lever a little bit, but not too much.
[03:41:50.914 --> 03:41:58.680]  And so if these reports are true and if the escalation continues, then I think we are in the closing chapters of Lord of the Rings.
[03:41:58.960 --> 03:42:12.210]  This time when a great darkness gets swept from the land and I guess a new God-King emerges from myth and legend and takes his Emperor's throne and all may have a chance to be right in the West.
[03:42:12.651 --> 03:42:13.892]  And that is something
[03:42:14.412 --> 03:42:19.097]  That is quite a passionate and powerful moment in human history.
[03:42:19.538 --> 03:42:21.840]  I believe in the future they will look back upon tomorrow.
[03:42:22.521 --> 03:42:30.149]  Should Trump get in, or if heaven forbid he doesn't, but if Trump gets in people will look upon that as a turning point and everything that led up
[03:42:30.589 --> 03:42:48.179]  To the victory that some circles of course are claiming is imminent will be studied in great detail and people I believe will hold in high esteem and with great honor everyone who helped to propel this victory, everyone who brought the truth out against the machinations and falsehoods of the mainstream media
[03:42:48.599 --> 03:42:55.347]  Everyone who convinced friends to learn and to overcome the lies that were being pumped down our throats on a daily basis.
[03:42:55.428 --> 03:43:01.715]  Everyone who helped pump out the bilge water of propaganda that passed for reporting in the modern West.
[03:43:01.795 --> 03:43:03.357]  Everybody will be seen.
[03:43:03.638 --> 03:43:04.979]  Everybody will be noted.
[03:43:05.880 --> 03:43:07.422]  And we'll be honored.
[03:43:07.642 --> 03:43:17.713]  And I think those of us who have worked hard to bring the truth to the people against all odds, and sometimes personal cost, will have great honor and great respect in the future.
[03:43:17.733 --> 03:43:24.661]  It's not why I do it, and I'm sure it's not why many people do it, but it's not a bad little piece of icing to have on the cake of moral satisfaction.
[03:43:24.841 --> 03:43:36.130]  You know, I just got this vision of Roger Stone holding the Ring of Power about to cast it into the lava and John Podesta as Gollum crawls on top of him, bites his finger off and falls in.
[03:43:36.410 --> 03:43:40.293]  But they talk about stabbing the finger in that creepy art piece.
[03:43:40.493 --> 03:43:41.634]  Insects of blood.
[03:43:41.974 --> 03:43:42.654]  Eat the pain.
[03:43:42.674 --> 03:43:45.356]  It's like, well, didn't Gollum bite the finger and the ring was destroyed?
[03:43:45.437 --> 03:43:46.978]  So, yes, I'm sorry.
[03:43:46.998 --> 03:43:49.119]  We can all geek out forever on Lord of the Rings stuff.
[03:43:50.200 --> 03:43:50.740]  No, it is.
[03:43:51.641 --> 03:43:55.523]  It is a powerful moment and there's still time.
[03:43:55.683 --> 03:43:58.825]  Let me just make this little tiny pitch to people out there.
[03:44:00.085 --> 03:44:02.467]  There is still time to retire from the fight with great honor.
[03:44:02.607 --> 03:44:18.095]  If you have refrained from talking to people in your social circle, if you have refrained from talking to people even at work, if you have refrained from talking to your family members because you don't want to cause any trouble or, you know, you don't want to make people upset or you don't want to build any bridges.
[03:44:18.215 --> 03:44:18.575]  Oh, sorry.
[03:44:18.575 --> 03:44:18.655]  It's
[03:44:39.198 --> 03:44:40.438]  Cowardice got the better of me.
[03:44:40.918 --> 03:44:44.479]  And okay, there was a victory, but I wasn't any part of it.
[03:44:45.059 --> 03:44:55.482]  And, you know, there are those posters, like I grew up, my family was on both sides involved in the Second World War, and I grew up with these posters, you know, hanging around, which is like, well, Daddy, what did you do in the Great War?
[03:44:55.802 --> 03:44:58.862]  And of course, the whole point was you're supposed to have some kind of answer to that.
[03:44:59.942 --> 03:45:01.783]  And if you don't have an answer as yet,
[03:45:02.671 --> 03:45:03.752]  There's still time.
[03:45:03.792 --> 03:45:07.316]  There's still time to do something that you can look back on with pride.
[03:45:07.376 --> 03:45:09.017]  And there's still time to take a stand.
[03:45:09.037 --> 03:45:11.059]  There's still time to change some minds.
[03:45:11.420 --> 03:45:22.331]  And I hope that people will avail themselves of that and avoid the future regret of not having been part of a victory that was so open for everyone to be a part of and to help.
[03:45:22.816 --> 03:45:24.218]  Yeah, I'm not getting in the game.
[03:45:24.258 --> 03:45:30.025]  If you don't get in the game, you ain't got any time to, uh, you've got no, you can't bitch, essentially.
[03:45:31.166 --> 03:45:32.668]  Got Dennis in Ontario.
[03:45:33.449 --> 03:45:34.450]  Trump with Stefan.
[03:45:34.470 --> 03:45:35.292]  I don't know what that means.
[03:45:35.312 --> 03:45:37.014]  Is that code for something, Dennis?
[03:45:37.054 --> 03:45:37.414]  Go ahead.
[03:45:37.434 --> 03:45:38.596]  And how are you listening to us right now?
[03:45:39.717 --> 03:45:40.318]  Oh my, what was that?
[03:45:41.158 --> 03:45:42.439]  How are you listening to us right now?
[03:45:42.859 --> 03:45:49.225]  I'm listening to you guys on InfoWars.com on the computer.
[03:45:49.825 --> 03:45:55.870]  I'm usually on the computer doing some work or something and I just have an extra tab open either watching or listening.
[03:45:56.570 --> 03:45:57.211]  Great!
[03:45:57.251 --> 03:45:58.292]  What's your question for Stefan?
[03:45:59.522 --> 03:46:15.556]  Well, you guys had Roger Stone on yesterday, and I was listening to how Roger Stone said there's not going to be any sort of way that Hillary, even if she is elected, is going to be able to show her face out into the public without getting attacked, right?
[03:46:16.795 --> 03:46:23.098]  She's been scrutinized for so long and so many people, you know, they're not ready to take a Hillary presidency.
[03:46:23.778 --> 03:46:32.742]  And, you know, right at this point, she has to beat a landslide and everybody knows she's going to have to do it in an unethical manner.
[03:46:33.062 --> 03:46:34.603]  So, I mean, what are your thoughts?
[03:46:34.623 --> 03:46:42.827]  Do you think that Hillary Clinton will be able to make any sort of damage with what might be a very short time in office?
[03:46:45.157 --> 03:46:51.158]  Well, I think that it would all depend on how things go with the Senate and the House, of course.
[03:46:51.238 --> 03:47:01.461]  I mean, if you get the trifecta, which is, of course, Hillary and Dems elsewhere in the seats of government, then you have an unstoppable force for the expansion of the state.
[03:47:01.881 --> 03:47:05.862]  And if there's some pushback, see, without Trump,
[03:47:06.776 --> 03:47:09.097]  Let's, I think, be very clear, at least in my mind.
[03:47:09.477 --> 03:47:22.060]  Without Trump, it seems to me that the Republicans are going to go back to being the ass-kissing, media-loving rhinos that they were in the past, where they'll say one thing to the electorate, and then they'll say another thing to the Democrats.
[03:47:22.120 --> 03:47:28.341]  You know, they'll say to the electorate, we'll fight them, we'll do this, we'll do that, and then they go to the Democrats and say, okay, what do you need so you won't call me a racist?
[03:47:28.421 --> 03:47:29.502]  Okay, I'll just give you that.
[03:47:31.282 --> 03:47:36.587]  What we're seeing in the Republican Party now is entirely carried on the shoulders of Trump.
[03:47:36.627 --> 03:47:41.471]  This resolution, this fight against the media, this fight against the powers that be, this fight.
[03:47:41.491 --> 03:47:44.633]  I mean, the man is a Goliath.
[03:47:44.713 --> 03:47:47.295]  I mean, he's a man-god of mortal combat.
[03:47:47.355 --> 03:47:52.279]  I mean, he is taking on every single conceivable establishment except maybe the Girl Guides.
[03:47:52.320 --> 03:47:53.140]  I think they like him.
[03:47:53.240 --> 03:47:56.423]  Everyone else is like down on the guy like you wouldn't believe.
[03:47:57.964 --> 03:48:08.690]  Seeing him walk through this seemingly endless wall as if it's just nothing more than fog is an enormously, and of course I'm sure it's tough at times on the inside and so on, but it's an enormously inspiring thing.
[03:48:09.270 --> 03:48:18.855]  Without Donald Trump, right, so if Hillary gets in without Donald Trump, my belief is that the Republicans are just going to sag back into the Republican name only conformity
[03:48:19.315 --> 03:48:19.495]  I think?
[03:48:36.044 --> 03:48:43.933]  This extra, what I can't remember how much money, this extra insane amount of money that they got during the financial crisis that's being reauthorized every single year.
[03:48:43.973 --> 03:48:45.775]  They don't have to pass a budget for years and years.
[03:48:46.255 --> 03:48:47.937]  This is not a small party government.
[03:48:47.957 --> 03:48:54.004]  Now with Trump, there's a chance that they will actually turn into the rhetoric they've been handing around like candy for many years.
[03:48:54.044 --> 03:48:54.624]  Without Trump,
[03:48:55.325 --> 03:48:57.808]  I don't see any particular resistance that's going to happen.
[03:48:57.828 --> 03:48:58.848]  It's not going to come from the media.
[03:48:58.869 --> 03:49:00.550]  It's not going to come from the mainstream media.
[03:49:00.810 --> 03:49:02.452]  It's not going to come from the entertainment industry.
[03:49:02.472 --> 03:49:04.234]  It sure as hell isn't going to come from academia.
[03:49:04.634 --> 03:49:05.855]  Is it going to come from the Reiners?
[03:49:05.915 --> 03:49:08.157]  Well, they had eight years to push back against Barack Obama.
[03:49:08.518 --> 03:49:09.739]  What did they actually achieve?
[03:49:10.019 --> 03:49:11.180]  And they all went against Trump.
[03:49:11.220 --> 03:49:14.884]  And Trump's talked endlessly about the arrows he's taken for people.
[03:49:15.324 --> 03:49:17.086]  And he didn't have to come out and run for president.
[03:49:17.626 --> 03:49:20.629]  And, you know, I think in the beginning he did kind of do it as a joke.
[03:49:20.689 --> 03:49:24.772]  But people started listening and go, why are you the only person out here saying things like this?
[03:49:24.952 --> 03:49:28.575]  Americanism and globalism and we have bad trade deals and our jobs are getting shipped to Mexico.
[03:49:28.835 --> 03:49:34.400]  How come no one else in this room of, you know, 30-something Republican candidates is saying that?
[03:49:34.940 --> 03:49:38.343]  They're just repeating the same talking points and pointing like this with their thumbs.
[03:49:39.471 --> 03:49:42.592]  Well, I think the answer for that is that he's a businessman.
[03:49:42.892 --> 03:49:49.733]  And most of the other Republican candidates come out of things like law and, you know, they're daddies who are politicians or they've been politicians.
[03:49:49.773 --> 03:49:50.973]  So they're not market facing.
[03:49:51.013 --> 03:50:01.195]  Now, Donald Trump has been a businessman his entire adult life, which means like you, like me, like everyone who's not in politics or who doesn't have some particular money printing license handed to them by the state.
[03:50:02.216 --> 03:50:03.696]  We have to care about the audience.
[03:50:03.756 --> 03:50:08.897]  Now, before Donald Trump became the nominee or before he decided to throw his hat into the ring,
[03:50:09.517 --> 03:50:15.481]  What he did was he hired someone to listen to talk radio and read conservative publications for over a year.
[03:50:16.182 --> 03:50:24.627]  Now for a year that person took notes and said, okay, they're really concerned about immigration, really concerned about trade, really concerned about jobs, and those are sort of the major issues.
[03:50:24.667 --> 03:50:27.169]  So he did his market research, as all good business people do,
[03:50:27.569 --> 03:50:38.471]  He did his market research, and then he came out of the gate with actual facts based upon what the voters really want, which they were talking about openly through Rush Limbaugh, through Sean Hannity's show, through Glenn Beck's show at the time.
[03:50:38.671 --> 03:50:41.311]  They were all talking very openly about what they were desperate for.
[03:50:41.691 --> 03:50:45.452]  Please, Lord above, let's have a little bit of a slowdown in mass immigration.
[03:50:45.492 --> 03:50:48.072]  So there's 40 million immigrants over the past little while.
[03:50:48.113 --> 03:50:49.633]  I mean, it's completely insane.
[03:50:49.673 --> 03:50:56.634]  There's no way that the dominant culture can absorb that many immigrants without being weakened and undermined and possibly even collapsing.
[03:50:57.094 --> 03:50:59.215]  So people were desperate for someone like Donald Trump.
[03:50:59.255 --> 03:51:02.796]  He didn't just come out and say, well, I think I'm going to pick these things out of thin air.
[03:51:03.336 --> 03:51:05.057]  What he did was he did the market research.
[03:51:05.137 --> 03:51:07.658]  What are Republicans desperate for?
[03:51:08.018 --> 03:51:08.818]  Representation.
[03:51:09.078 --> 03:51:14.040]  And he knew, based upon the Gang of Eight, based upon all the stuff that happened before, he knew for sure.
[03:51:14.580 --> 03:51:27.343]  That the RINOs, the existing Republicans, weren't even going to talk a good talk about providing what the Republicans were so desperately after, which was better trade deals, less immigration, jobs, smaller government.
[03:51:27.743 --> 03:51:29.043]  These guys weren't going to provide it.
[03:51:29.123 --> 03:51:35.745]  And of course, as a businessman, you do market research, you look at your competitors, you say, well, there's a huge market demand for what I'm going to provide here.
[03:51:35.985 --> 03:51:39.626]  My competitors aren't even going to talk about providing it that much.
[03:51:40.166 --> 03:51:43.929]  And this is why it was not that hard to figure out how well he was going to do.
[03:51:43.969 --> 03:51:52.174]  If you've been an entrepreneur, you've read the market, you've checked out the competitors, and you're providing a desperately needed good at a desperately needed time, guess what?
[03:51:52.454 --> 03:51:55.917]  Build a better mousetrap, and people will beat a path to your door.
[03:51:56.037 --> 03:51:58.458]  You're going to have tens of thousands at your rallies, too.
[03:51:59.219 --> 03:52:01.200]  And I've been to a lot of these rallies.
[03:52:01.280 --> 03:52:02.421]  These people are peaceful.
[03:52:02.781 --> 03:52:07.745]  I've seen them from all types of colors and sexes, and everybody's there.
[03:52:07.885 --> 03:52:09.366]  You know, gay guys for Trump.
[03:52:09.986 --> 03:52:17.877]  Blacks for Trump, Hispanics for Trump, immigrants for Trump who became citizens and want to see everybody else, you know, if you want to come into this country, become a citizen.
[03:52:17.917 --> 03:52:24.847]  It took one guy seven years, but he did it and he felt he was so honored to be a citizen at that point because it wasn't just given to him.
[03:52:26.289 --> 03:52:28.411]  And he was ready to vote, ready to vote for Donald Trump.
[03:52:28.751 --> 03:52:33.734]  And once again, we're in the midst of this 52-hour live election broadcast, and we have a super sale going on.
[03:52:34.095 --> 03:52:36.156]  And I'd like to thank Stefan Molyneux for joining me.
[03:52:36.456 --> 03:52:39.819]  We're about 50 minutes in right now of a whole hour he's going to be joining us here.
[03:52:40.459 --> 03:52:51.127]  30% off Supermail Vitality, 30% off DNA Force, 30 to 40% off the InfoWars Select Storable Food, 30% off Survival Shield X2, 30% off ProPure King Water Filters.
[03:52:52.208 --> 03:52:55.393]  25% off Secret 12 and 15% off Molon Law Bay Apparel.
[03:52:55.653 --> 03:52:56.815]  Stefan, do you filter your water?
[03:52:56.835 --> 03:52:59.419]  I do, in fact.
[03:52:59.920 --> 03:53:01.783]  There's a whole water filter system in the house.
[03:53:02.284 --> 03:53:03.085]  Yeah, I mean, it's...
[03:53:03.849 --> 03:53:05.090]  Everybody's doing it, people.
[03:53:06.331 --> 03:53:08.372]  If you're drinking out of the tap, there's something wrong with you.
[03:53:08.412 --> 03:53:09.353]  Dennis, thanks for calling.
[03:53:09.693 --> 03:53:11.695]  I'm going to try to get to a couple more calls before we go.
[03:53:11.775 --> 03:53:15.077]  And when we end, guys, I want y'all to have this video queued up.
[03:53:15.097 --> 03:53:15.717]  We saw this.
[03:53:15.757 --> 03:53:17.239]  Somebody sent this to me on email.
[03:53:18.099 --> 03:53:19.540]  MAGA Wars, The Last Hope.
[03:53:19.600 --> 03:53:21.502]  It's a spoof some people put together.
[03:53:22.415 --> 03:53:23.916]  There's pretty good special effects.
[03:53:24.036 --> 03:53:26.658]  Alex Jones is in it, Leigh-Anne Mackett is in it, Donald Trump's in it.
[03:53:27.598 --> 03:53:28.279]  You gotta watch it.
[03:53:28.299 --> 03:53:29.940]  We're gonna play that and then go to break.
[03:53:30.400 --> 03:53:35.123]  Because we are, I know, I can tell Stefan's a Star Wars nerd too because he smirked a little bit just now.
[03:53:35.883 --> 03:53:37.704]  And we're having him on Skype.
[03:53:37.724 --> 03:53:38.745]  Where do you live in Canada?
[03:53:40.026 --> 03:53:44.749]  I live just a little bit north of Toronto, which of course is the major city in Ontario.
[03:53:45.469 --> 03:53:46.630]  It is a sprawling city too.
[03:53:46.670 --> 03:53:49.292]  I've driven past through there going to Sudbury a couple times.
[03:53:50.293 --> 03:53:50.734]  Sudbury.
[03:53:51.014 --> 03:53:51.514]  Yeah.
[03:53:51.534 --> 03:53:53.296]  Did you lose some sort of horrible bet?
[03:53:53.476 --> 03:53:56.579]  What draws you north to Sudbury?
[03:53:56.719 --> 03:53:59.202]  Do you love the smell of potash in the morning?
[03:53:59.262 --> 03:53:59.782]  I shouldn't say that.
[03:53:59.803 --> 03:54:01.925]  I'm going to get all these messages from people who live in Sudbury.
[03:54:02.065 --> 03:54:02.745]  It's a great town.
[03:54:02.825 --> 03:54:05.628]  We really, we stayed at a really nice bed and breakfast on a lake.
[03:54:05.688 --> 03:54:07.270]  I apologize already, but go ahead.
[03:54:07.570 --> 03:54:08.811]  Yeah, it was beautiful.
[03:54:08.831 --> 03:54:10.713]  We were going there to interview a guest back in, I think, 2010, 2011.
[03:54:12.715 --> 03:54:14.376]  Let's go to Tim in Ohio.
[03:54:14.956 --> 03:54:17.436]  Opinions on the troops scattered worldwide.
[03:54:17.556 --> 03:54:18.597]  I think we can bring them home.
[03:54:18.617 --> 03:54:24.358]  I are, you know, instead of just being there guarding things, why not helping people put in infrastructure if we're going to have them out there?
[03:54:24.398 --> 03:54:25.058]  But go ahead, Tim.
[03:54:25.078 --> 03:54:34.581]  It's Jim, sorry, but yeah, we all know that Obama has been systematically shrinking our military.
[03:54:35.241 --> 03:54:38.682]  And also, it seems like now that we have Hillary Clinton
[03:54:39.801 --> 03:54:52.785]  It's constantly poking at Russia and China, specifically Russia, and we have our troops kind of scattered all over the place, and Obama signed the executive order allowing the UN troops to basically come in here and help police everything.
[03:54:53.645 --> 03:54:57.006]  Do you think that they were planning up for this?
[03:54:57.026 --> 03:55:01.167]  Do you think that they kind of knew they were going to steal the election?
[03:55:01.207 --> 03:55:08.649]  Because I've already read reports saying that they're gearing up for unruly, you know, people once this thing happens, and civil unrest.
[03:55:09.264 --> 03:55:13.507]  Do you think that that was intentional for coming up to this?
[03:55:14.588 --> 03:55:30.440]  And do you think that, say, if Donald Trump wins, if Hillary doesn't steal it, do you see the Obama administration or somebody having a false flag attack or something like that that would basically suspend Trump from being inaugurated?
[03:55:34.113 --> 03:55:41.039]  It certainly would not be without precedent in history for false flag attacks to end up suspending democratic processes.
[03:55:41.159 --> 03:55:52.730]  I consider it an outside possibility because I do think that what Trump represents is such a strong movement that they really would be risking an outright civil war if they were to try and do something like that.
[03:55:52.830 --> 03:55:57.194]  And I, you know, I've made the case even on this show and on my own show as well at freedomainradio.com.
[03:55:57.994 --> 03:56:03.018]  That they are power addicts on the left and they will do almost anything to get and maintain power.
[03:56:03.378 --> 03:56:09.342]  But I don't really think that's within the realm of high possibility or even low possibility at the moment.
[03:56:09.382 --> 03:56:12.164]  I think that there is going to be an orderly transition of power.
[03:56:12.184 --> 03:56:22.211]  I think that the Democrat strategy, if I sort of had to put that hat on, however uncomfortable it may be morally for me, I think the Democrat strategy is to say,
[03:56:23.152 --> 03:56:25.174]  We're not going to provoke a constitutional crisis.
[03:56:25.194 --> 03:56:28.216]  We're not going to provoke or add fuel to any secessionist movements.
[03:56:28.236 --> 03:56:29.697]  We're not going to risk any kind of civil war.
[03:56:29.737 --> 03:56:39.125]  What we're going to do is we're going to dig in with the media and we're going to work to discredit and oppose Donald Trump's presidency for the next four years and we're going to find somebody to run
[03:56:40.766 --> 03:56:41.986]  When the time is right.
[03:56:42.066 --> 03:56:45.987]  I think that they're going to return, retreat, lick their wounds, try and figure out how to do things better.
[03:56:46.007 --> 03:56:49.268]  And I think that's how it's going to go.
[03:56:49.348 --> 03:56:53.529]  So yes, certainly in the past there have been lots of false flags and suspensions of democracies.
[03:56:53.990 --> 03:56:55.470]  I don't think the America is there yet.
[03:56:55.590 --> 03:57:06.173]  I think if it were to go as I fear it would go under a democratic administration for four or probably eight more years, I think you would start to see secessionist movements in the US.
[03:57:06.813 --> 03:57:12.199]  I think you would start to see a lot of conflict, the kind of which America hadn't seen since sort of the mid 19th century.
[03:57:12.759 --> 03:57:14.962]  But I don't think that we're there yet.
[03:57:15.062 --> 03:57:19.026]  I think that the Trump movement is an attempt to avoid that potential outcome.
[03:57:19.146 --> 03:57:26.634]  And that's one of the reasons I think that all reasonable and good thinking people should look into the candidate with an open mind for that reason, if for no other.
[03:57:29.181 --> 03:57:30.943]  Yeah, hey, thanks, Tim, for calling in.
[03:57:30.963 --> 03:57:32.064]  I think that was a great question.
[03:57:32.084 --> 03:57:33.666]  That's a good spot to kind of end it on.
[03:57:33.706 --> 03:57:36.328]  I've had my guest for the last hour has been Stefan Molyneux.
[03:57:36.348 --> 03:57:41.293]  You can find more of his work on his YouTube channel at Free Domain Radio.
[03:57:41.313 --> 03:57:43.896]  That's YouTube.com, Free Domain Radio.
[03:57:43.976 --> 03:57:44.596]  Check that out.
[03:57:44.977 --> 03:57:45.577]  He's got a lot.
[03:57:45.938 --> 03:57:49.221]  I like how you can go long-winded for 30-minute stretches at a time.
[03:57:49.802 --> 03:57:52.724]  I don't know if you're reading notes or anything, but you seem to keep
[03:57:53.405 --> 03:57:58.908]  You have this ability to talk for long periods of time without looking down, and I greatly respect that.
[03:57:58.948 --> 03:58:04.290]  My next goal, Rob, of course, is I'm going to try and get that jazz trumpet thing where you can just talk without even having to inhale.
[03:58:04.730 --> 03:58:09.553]  Right now, I of course have to pause to inhale, which I consider a massive inefficiency in my productivity.
[03:58:10.253 --> 03:58:11.695]  I think this is the first time we've chatted.
[03:58:11.715 --> 03:58:13.877]  I appreciate the invitation on the show.
[03:58:13.958 --> 03:58:17.101]  I wish you the very best in your next grueling 6 a.m.
[03:58:17.201 --> 03:58:17.842]  You're back.
[03:58:18.002 --> 03:58:19.664]  I'm back on the 6 a.m.
[03:58:19.685 --> 03:58:25.612]  Thanks a lot for the time today and good luck tomorrow and good luck America and the Western world tomorrow.
[03:58:26.313 --> 03:58:29.777]  Hopefully we're not going to need it, but if we do need it, I hope it'll be there.
[03:58:30.037 --> 03:58:40.631]  Well, if what Alex came in and said is true, and I'm pretty sure it is, just judging by the rallies, and you couldn't even get people at a LeBron James rally in Cleveland, not even a thousand people.
[03:58:41.633 --> 03:58:45.298]  What he said today, just now, talking about how it's bonafide for Trump.
[03:58:45.718 --> 03:58:47.379]  And it's getting better and better every hour.
[03:58:47.699 --> 03:58:49.799]  I'm feeling good about it, but don't forget to go out and vote.
[03:58:49.819 --> 03:58:50.880]  Thanks for joining me, Stefan.
[03:58:50.940 --> 03:58:53.821]  Once again, his YouTube channel is Free Domain Radio.
[03:58:53.961 --> 03:58:55.741]  Also, check him out at freedomainradio.com.
[03:58:56.401 --> 03:59:00.383]  Once again, before we go, Alex is going to be up next from 8 to 10, maybe even longer.
[03:59:00.403 --> 03:59:05.624]  At 9 o'clock, he's going to have Jesse James on, who's a gun aficionado.
[03:59:05.704 --> 03:59:11.566]  He's launching a new, I don't even know what it is yet, a new product, and it should be very interesting.
[03:59:11.586 --> 03:59:13.247]  This will be the first time Jesse James has been on the show.
[03:59:13.547 --> 03:59:14.287]  But before we go,
[03:59:14.747 --> 03:59:17.209]  We're going to play that MAGA Wars coming up.
[03:59:17.589 --> 03:59:44.207]  30% off Supermail Vitality, 30% off DNA Force, 30-40% off InfoWars Select Storable Foods, 30% off Survival Shield X2, 30% off Pro King Water Filters, 25% off Secret 12, and 15% off all Mullen LaBae apparel, but it's only during our 52-hour Super Sale fundraiser, and it has begun, and we're going to be here until 3 p.m., maybe even longer if they haven't decided how to fix the voting machines by that time.
[03:59:45.247 --> 03:59:46.248]  We'll be here even longer.
[03:59:46.528 --> 03:59:48.469]  But 52 hours is what we promised you.
[03:59:48.729 --> 03:59:51.471]  We actually started 15 minutes early on Facebook.
[03:59:52.031 --> 03:59:57.014]  In fact, I've got to go stop the Facebook stream and restart it again because it can only go for four hours at a time.
[03:59:57.254 --> 03:59:57.955]  This has been Rob Dew.
[03:59:57.975 --> 04:00:01.497]  You can follow me at DewsNews on Twitter, D-E-W-S-N-E-W-Z.
[04:00:01.797 --> 04:00:02.658]  Thanks for watching.
[04:00:02.718 --> 04:00:03.438]  Spread the word.
[04:00:03.498 --> 04:00:05.359]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[04:00:05.699 --> 04:00:06.780]  Spread the links around.
[04:00:07.140 --> 04:00:11.603]  If you're not doing something, then you're doing nothing and, man, you might as well put Hillary Clinton in power.
[04:00:12.063 --> 04:00:13.465]  And you don't want to be in that world.
[04:00:13.485 --> 04:00:15.267]  Let me tell you, it's not going to be a world that's pretty.
[04:00:15.307 --> 04:00:20.893]  It's going to be a world that, uh, that ugliness and, uh, and perverseness is brought up.
[04:00:20.913 --> 04:00:22.554]  Yeah, go ahead.
[04:00:22.735 --> 04:00:25.257]  Look, this whole place is funded by our viewers and listeners.
[04:00:25.698 --> 04:00:26.879]  We have everything people need.
[04:00:26.939 --> 04:00:30.102]  High quality, non GMO seeds, the best water filters out there.
[04:00:30.343 --> 04:00:32.265]  Five or six great companies that are all really high quality.
[04:00:32.645 --> 04:00:33.506]  They're all apples and oranges.
[04:00:33.546 --> 04:00:34.928]  Some are better at this, some are better than that.
[04:00:35.008 --> 04:00:36.770]  It all cuts the stuff down to non-detectable levels.
[04:00:37.011 --> 04:00:39.214]  Or cuts it all out, depending on what the chemical is.
[04:00:39.274 --> 04:00:40.976]  You're insane if you're not filtering the water.
[04:00:41.416 --> 04:00:43.099]  I still drink stuff at the store sometimes, or whatever.
[04:00:43.119 --> 04:00:44.901]  The point is, overall, I'm trying to avoid it.
[04:00:44.921 --> 04:00:46.803]  I think almost everyone here has a water filter.
[04:00:46.824 --> 04:00:48.265]  I got shower filters, all of it.
[04:00:49.006 --> 04:00:52.747]  Uh, but we've got the biggest sales ever and free shipping at Infowarsstore.com.
[04:00:53.288 --> 04:00:55.448]  And we need to bring, yeah, we've got the biggest sales ever.

[04:02:15.023 --> 04:02:16.044]  A very huge time to be alive.
[04:02:16.684 --> 04:02:18.065]  I'm going to be live for the next 3-4 hours.
[04:02:18.506 --> 04:02:19.586]  Jesse James is coming in.
[04:02:19.626 --> 04:02:20.367]  Fell off tonight.
[04:02:20.407 --> 04:02:20.827]  Patriot.
[04:02:21.268 --> 04:02:21.988]  Working with Donald Trump.
[04:02:22.008 --> 04:02:22.809]  Pro-gun guy.
[04:02:22.909 --> 04:02:24.070]  Demonized by the Hollywood.
[04:02:24.090 --> 04:02:25.150]  He was all set up, folks.
[04:02:25.531 --> 04:02:26.351]  He would become a liberal.
[04:02:26.371 --> 04:02:27.072]  It was all fake.
[04:02:27.452 --> 04:02:28.733]  Point is, he's not coming on about that today.
[04:02:28.753 --> 04:02:30.214]  He's coming on in about an hour.
[04:02:30.234 --> 04:02:32.496]  He's going to be here to break it all down with us in studio.
[04:02:32.776 --> 04:02:33.997]  So, great job, dude.
[04:02:34.037 --> 04:02:34.857]  Thanks to the rest of the crew.
[04:02:34.877 --> 04:02:35.418]  Get us some dinner.
[04:02:35.438 --> 04:02:38.660]  We're going to air what Hillary wants to do.
[04:02:39.140 --> 04:02:41.242]  What the world thinks Hillary wants to set up.
[04:02:41.642 --> 04:02:42.863]  Why the whole world doesn't like her?
[04:02:42.883 --> 04:02:44.064]  Why our military doesn't like her?
[04:02:44.084 --> 04:02:45.025]  Why the Russians don't like her?
[04:02:45.425 --> 04:02:46.786]  Why anybody with half a brain doesn't like her?
[04:02:47.227 --> 04:02:49.508]  Here is Hillary's world, and I'm going to be live in the studio.
[04:02:49.528 --> 04:02:49.889]  Stay with us.
[04:02:49.929 --> 04:02:50.369]  Let's do it.
[04:02:50.389 --> 04:02:51.070]  Spread the word, folks.
[04:02:51.650 --> 04:02:59.056]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[04:02:59.536 --> 04:03:07.243]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[04:03:07.463 --> 04:03:09.544]  As president, I will make it clear.
[04:03:10.465 --> 04:03:21.089]  If the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack, we will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[04:03:21.149 --> 04:03:24.510]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[04:03:24.550 --> 04:03:27.491]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[04:03:27.551 --> 04:03:30.132]  We came, we saw, he died.
[04:03:32.512 --> 04:03:34.533]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[04:03:34.913 --> 04:03:38.314]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[04:03:38.574 --> 04:03:46.477]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[04:03:48.382 --> 04:03:48.862]  The U.S.
[04:03:48.902 --> 04:03:52.525]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[04:03:52.865 --> 04:04:00.490]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[04:04:00.850 --> 04:04:03.192]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[04:04:03.212 --> 04:04:06.454]  Of course not, because she's- Look, there's a really loud noise.
[04:04:06.914 --> 04:04:11.937]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[04:04:11.957 --> 04:04:14.179]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[04:04:17.981 --> 04:04:22.402]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[04:04:52.176 --> 04:05:09.862]  My fellow Americans, my fellow humans on planet Earth, there is an epic, legendary awakening of nationalism and populism happening from the Brexit to the Donald Trump phenomenon to Russia pulling out of the New World Order and arresting the gangster oligarchs.
[04:05:10.562 --> 04:05:12.983]  Humanity's will for self-determination
[04:05:13.883 --> 04:05:15.723]  And freedom is expressing itself.
[04:05:16.203 --> 04:05:23.605]  The great classical liberalisms of Thomas Jefferson and Francis Bacon are reawakening right now.
[04:05:24.385 --> 04:05:33.567]  And it's because of the historical times we live in that InfoWars is going to embark on an unprecedented 52-hour broadcast.
[04:05:33.607 --> 04:05:39.128]  We've done 24-hour broadcasts before, but we've never gone 52 hours.
[04:05:39.688 --> 04:05:40.428]  This Monday,
[04:05:40.968 --> 04:05:42.368]  From 11 a.m.
[04:05:42.449 --> 04:05:48.110]  Central right through Tuesday right into Wednesday when the Wednesday show ends at 3 p.m.
[04:05:48.170 --> 04:06:01.615]  Central we will broadcast for an unprecedented legendary over-the-top 52 hours live the second great awakening is taking place we are in the dawn of a new
[04:06:02.515 --> 04:06:07.159]  The era of renaissance, of rediscovery, and human liberty.
[04:06:07.800 --> 04:06:20.851]  Donald Trump, the Brexit, Infowars, Matt Drudge, Breitbart, WorldNetDaily, and so many others are only one small manifestation in the fire of liberty that is now exploding across the globe.
[04:06:21.471 --> 04:06:23.092]  You can see it in the news.
[04:06:23.152 --> 04:06:24.033]  You can feel it.
[04:06:24.513 --> 04:06:25.714]  You can witness it on the street.
[04:06:26.374 --> 04:06:27.255]  History's happening.
[04:06:27.595 --> 04:06:31.757]  They always say this election is the most important in our lifetimes and we laugh it off.
[04:06:31.857 --> 04:06:35.319]  I wouldn't even get involved in past elections because they were so clearly frauds.
[04:06:36.000 --> 04:06:37.181]  This one's the big kahuna.
[04:06:38.021 --> 04:06:46.403]  A clear demarcation line, a crossroads between nationalism and tyranny, between Americanism and globalism.
[04:06:47.044 --> 04:06:51.185]  That's why we're doing this one time and one time only, because history's happening.
[04:06:51.645 --> 04:06:59.807]  A 52-hour live transmission, kicking off Monday, November 7th, 2016 at 11 a.m., running right through Election Day the 8th,
[04:07:03.308 --> 04:07:04.889]  End of the night at 3 p.m.
[04:07:04.929 --> 04:07:06.090]  and quite frankly beyond.
[04:07:06.451 --> 04:07:12.456]  It's historical and it's part of overthrowing the dinosaur media, not just overthrowing the two-party corrupt system.
[04:07:12.956 --> 04:07:18.661]  I want to see 10 million viewers tune in over the 50 plus hours and that's where you come in.
[04:07:19.101 --> 04:07:20.822]  You are the heart and blood of the InfoWar.
[04:07:21.143 --> 04:07:30.851]  If you spread the link to InfoWars.com forward slash show and point out that this is the alternative new media, this is the rebellion, this is the modern Paul Revere operation,
[04:07:31.431 --> 04:07:34.953]  Then all of you are riding right beside us, not behind us.
[04:07:35.333 --> 04:07:41.898]  So spread the word by Paul Revere's, no matter where you live in the world, to Information Warfare Arms.
[04:07:42.218 --> 04:07:45.380]  The globalists are coming and they will be met on the field.
[04:07:47.201 --> 04:07:49.462]  Infowars.com powered by 1776.
[04:07:52.384 --> 04:07:56.527]  We're now three hours and 54 minutes out from midnight,
