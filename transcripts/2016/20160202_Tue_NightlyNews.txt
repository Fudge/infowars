[00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:21.646]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:25.767]  It is Tuesday, February 2nd, 2016, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.907 --> 00:00:27.048]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.951]  Tonight, the Carson campaign accuses Cruz of playing a dirty trick.
[00:00:37.712 --> 00:00:41.953]  Then, you'll be shocked by what a school forced a child to do.
[00:00:42.754 --> 00:00:44.734]  And college kids feel the burn.
[00:00:45.415 --> 00:00:46.075]  That's next.
[00:00:47.026 --> 00:00:51.327]  You've lived in freedom so long, you're defecating all over what your forebears gave you.
[00:00:51.347 --> 00:00:52.628]  But what about Sanders?
[00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:53.448]  Such a creep.
[00:00:54.148 --> 00:00:55.169]  Such a weasel.
[00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.949]  He knows it's a fraud.
[00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:01.211]  He knows the ultra-rich love socialism because they're exempt from it offshore.
[00:01:01.631 --> 00:01:08.373]  To see tens of thousands out for him and all the frothing idiots that follow him, it's very despicable.
[00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:11.451]  He's kind of like an old Che Guevara t-shirt, isn't he?
[00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:20.459]  I mean, I call him Bernie Sandinista because we had these videos that were released showing him going back in the 1980s talking to the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, talking about how wonderful they were.
[00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:01.624]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:03.206]  You can't survive without it.
[00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:04.308]  But where do you get it?
[00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:10.375]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:16.302]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:33.360]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.881]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.441]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:38.501]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:39.361]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:41.482]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:03:03.902 --> 00:03:09.043]  Well, it's one day following the Iowa caucuses, a curious slice of American politics.
[00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:15.484]  Of course, there were some surprises, and as always with any election cycle, there are already cries of foul play.
[00:03:15.844 --> 00:03:17.765]  Now, first comes from the Carson camp.
[00:03:18.405 --> 00:03:22.985]  They've accused the Cruz camp of foul play in the Iowa caucuses.
[00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:29.907]  They claim that Cruz's team spread false rumors at caucus sites, saying that Carson had dropped out.
[00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:38.070]  Carson's team claimed that the Cruz camp deliberately sent emails to supporters spreading false rumors at caucus sites.
[00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:44.274]  They say they were telling his supporters to caucus for other candidates because Carson wasn't planning on showing up.
[00:03:44.814 --> 00:04:00.442]  Now today Ted Cruz has apologized for his campaign's role in swaying voters by any chance and he said yesterday when CNN reported and put up a post that Carson was going to be continuing on to New Hampshire and not
[00:04:01.062 --> 00:04:03.684]  Not going to Iowa, going to continue on to South Carolina.
[00:04:04.005 --> 00:04:07.407]  Instead, he was going to be flying home to Florida for some fresh clothes.
[00:04:08.308 --> 00:04:20.799]  The political team forwarded that to everyone that was on their email and they failed to forward out a clarifying statement from Carson's camp that said, you know, we're going to be, we're sticking in the race.
[00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:21.979]  We're just not going to be here.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.200]  He had to go home to Florida.
[00:04:23.601 --> 00:04:29.426]  So they are saying that deliberately, um, Cruz deliberately tried to sway voters in that way.
[00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:31.271]  Who knows?
[00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:37.294]  You know, everyone says they don't trust Ted Cruz, but apparently they're going to vote for him.
[00:04:37.394 --> 00:04:39.995]  So here we go once again.
[00:04:40.475 --> 00:04:49.659]  Now, Trump, of course, he came in second, which was surprising to a lot of people, probably even Trump himself, who promised big wins this election cycle.
[00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:57.483]  But he says he's honored with this second place finish and he vows he'll win the nomination and whoever the hell the Dems nominate.
[00:04:58.183 --> 00:05:01.285]  Trump said, I was told by everybody, do not go to Iowa.
[00:05:01.305 --> 00:05:03.286]  You could never finish even in the top 10.
[00:05:03.426 --> 00:05:04.786]  But I said, I have to do it.
[00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:05.567]  I have to go.
[00:05:06.187 --> 00:05:07.628]  And he said, you know, we have a poll.
[00:05:07.688 --> 00:05:09.049]  We're 28 points ahead.
[00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:10.269]  I'm OK with that.
[00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:15.052]  Now, of course, the media today has come out saying that Trump is done.
[00:05:15.092 --> 00:05:16.272]  The mystique is gone.
[00:05:16.392 --> 00:05:17.693]  Trump's bubble has burst.
[00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:19.334]  But the mystique that
[00:05:19.674 --> 00:05:24.960]  You know, the mystique that isn't there, what is crystal clear is the establishment's push for Rubio.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.042]  Now, Richard Reeves was there in Iowa.
[00:05:27.082 --> 00:05:28.123]  He alluded to this fact.
[00:05:28.163 --> 00:05:34.490]  He said every single station you turned on, every radio station, everyone, you just kept hearing it over and over again, this Rubio surge.
[00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.715]  And, of course, we saw that there as the numbers were coming in last night.
[00:05:39.275 --> 00:05:45.700]  Now the Washington Post, Kurt Nimmo points all of this out in his article, how the establishment has been pushing for Rubio.
[00:05:46.081 --> 00:06:00.072]  The Washington Post hailed the junior senator from Florida for being the Trump slayer and they declared the Iowa results put Rubio in a strong position to break away from the crowded establishment pack and claim the mantle of alternative to Cruz and Trump.
[00:06:00.532 --> 00:06:02.853]  Hello, Rubio is the establishment.
[00:06:02.913 --> 00:06:06.613]  He's got huge establishment donors to his campaign.
[00:06:06.693 --> 00:06:08.054]  He's like the clear choice.
[00:06:08.094 --> 00:06:09.834]  It's either him or Cruz.
[00:06:10.414 --> 00:06:14.955]  And then, of course, Nemo points out how Fox News has been relentlessly pushing for Rubio.
[00:06:15.435 --> 00:06:18.296]  They said it doesn't matter how much Trump or Cruz lead.
[00:06:18.696 --> 00:06:22.877]  What's more important is to take note of how well Rubio did on Monday evening.
[00:06:23.617 --> 00:06:26.058]  And they say it's his turn now.
[00:06:28.018 --> 00:06:34.920]  Also, we have another emailed statement saying that this could be the first sign that the Trump bubble is about to burst.
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.901]  The betting is now firmly pointing toward a Clinton-Rubio showdown in November.
[00:06:40.642 --> 00:06:51.785]  So, of course, all of this comes as no surprise because it's perfectly timed with several of those top establishment wonks putting out the call to take out Trump no matter what.
[00:06:52.325 --> 00:07:00.128]  Now, of course, Trump supporters think that Microsoft had a helping hand in Rubio cheating Iowa, as a lot of people are saying.
[00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:04.530]  There's a hashtag, Microsoft Rubio Fraud, trending on Twitter.
[00:07:05.911 --> 00:07:08.332]  Because, you know, he was trailing far behind.
[00:07:08.412 --> 00:07:13.233]  But then all of a sudden, Microsoft is Rubio's number two campaign contributor.
[00:07:13.674 --> 00:07:16.295]  Also create this app for all the caucuses to use.
[00:07:17.015 --> 00:07:21.237]  So one of the memes asks, nice of them to count the votes, wasn't it?
[00:07:22.237 --> 00:07:29.324]  But also, speaking of curiously lucky, is probably one of the most luckiest women in the universe, Hillary Clinton.
[00:07:29.784 --> 00:07:34.108]  She beat Bernie Sanders six times because of a coin toss.
[00:07:34.549 --> 00:07:38.392]  So this was in at least six different precincts across Iowa Monday night.
[00:07:38.512 --> 00:07:45.118]  The Democratic caucuses, their votes ended in a tie, so they'll decide who gets a delegate by a coin toss.
[00:07:46.059 --> 00:07:48.220]  And, of course, we saw all of this.
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.340]  She won all of these.
[00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:53.022]  And she secured an incredibly narrow lead.
[00:07:53.082 --> 00:07:54.963]  I think it was like .3%.
[00:07:55.763 --> 00:07:59.204]  And how likely is it to win a coin toss six times in a row?
[00:07:59.685 --> 00:08:00.965]  Well, it's around a chance of 1.6%.
[00:08:01.505 --> 00:08:08.288]  So here's Alex Jones earlier today giving his take on whether it's time for all of us to put on our tinfoil hats.
[00:08:10.349 --> 00:08:12.070]  I want to do this on air for TV viewers.
[00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.311]  I will narrate it and describe it for radio listeners across the United States and the world.
[00:08:17.156 --> 00:08:32.147]  One of the clear evidences of fraud last night is that Hillary was going to lose if she didn't get the six coin tosses in a row.
[00:08:32.167 --> 00:08:40.154]  It was supposed to go to Sanders, but she magically got the six coin tosses for the disputed delegate because they were in a dead heat.
[00:08:40.494 --> 00:08:41.074]  She won by 0.2%.
[00:08:41.114 --> 00:08:45.778]  And then, of course, the craziness just continued from there.
[00:08:47.472 --> 00:08:50.555]  Where she'd have ballots already counted for her, and they would double count them right in front of people.
[00:08:51.175 --> 00:08:57.641]  And then, they wouldn't put that in the app because it had already been tallied, so it would show it as fraudulent, so they quote, called it in.
[00:08:58.722 --> 00:08:59.563]  It's all on video.
[00:09:00.283 --> 00:09:01.544]  It's all on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:02.005 --> 00:09:05.948]  And even mainstream media covers it and goes, wow, this is kind of weird, let's just move along.
[00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:13.115]  Here we go, so let's say six heads, and Hillary, in a row, she gets
[00:09:14.465 --> 00:09:17.628]  That disputed delegate that if she wouldn't have gotten it, she would have lost to Bernie Sanders.
[00:09:17.788 --> 00:09:18.148]  Here we go!
[00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:19.650]  Oh!
[00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:20.190]  Heads!
[00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:20.791]  She got it!
[00:09:21.551 --> 00:09:21.912]  First one!
[00:09:21.932 --> 00:09:22.793]  Let me show folks!
[00:09:23.013 --> 00:09:23.253]  Heads!
[00:09:24.054 --> 00:09:24.915]  Let's document, Cam.
[00:09:24.935 --> 00:09:25.315]  There you go.
[00:09:27.417 --> 00:09:29.018]  So, she just won the first toss.
[00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:31.501]  Let's mark that right here.
[00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:32.522]  That's one for Hillary.
[00:09:33.282 --> 00:09:34.263]  She is a lucky lady, huh?
[00:09:34.623 --> 00:09:35.584]  Let's do the second one here.
[00:09:36.825 --> 00:09:37.026]  Hey!
[00:09:37.186 --> 00:09:37.666]  Lucky lady!
[00:09:37.706 --> 00:09:38.207]  She did it again!
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.141]  Oh, whoa!
[00:09:44.782 --> 00:09:46.364]  She got tails on number three.
[00:09:46.484 --> 00:09:47.205]  What do you know?
[00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:49.008]  What do you know?
[00:09:49.428 --> 00:09:53.453]  Out of six heads, this is tails.
[00:09:54.875 --> 00:09:55.676]  So we got one there.
[00:09:55.756 --> 00:09:56.778]  Let's keep tallying here.
[00:09:56.798 --> 00:09:58.079]  Let's do it again.
[00:09:59.581 --> 00:09:59.681]  Oh!
[00:10:00.543 --> 00:10:01.424]  Tails again, right there.
[00:10:04.505 --> 00:10:08.646]  So that's head to head, two heads, two tails tied.
[00:10:09.446 --> 00:10:11.766]  And we got, we got two more toying tosses.
[00:10:12.147 --> 00:10:18.728]  In fact, this will be deciding, but I guess if she didn't get all six, it went into more toying tosses.
[00:10:21.268 --> 00:10:21.929]  Tails again.
[00:10:22.029 --> 00:10:22.949]  Sorry, Hillary.
[00:10:24.109 --> 00:10:24.889]  Sorry, sweetie.
[00:10:25.929 --> 00:10:29.530]  Now, if you don't get this one and it's totally tied, she'll lose.
[00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.251]  But remember, she just got all six in a row.
[00:10:32.311 --> 00:10:33.611]  So there was never any doubt.
[00:10:35.939 --> 00:10:36.820]  Oh, tails again.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.241]  Sorry, Hillary.
[00:10:39.141 --> 00:10:41.243]  Sorry you don't get the delegate Bernie Sanders does.
[00:10:41.643 --> 00:10:43.565]  But see, that's in the real world.
[00:10:44.585 --> 00:10:45.306]  That's in the real world.
[00:10:45.326 --> 00:10:46.126]  Here, let's just keep flipping.
[00:10:47.347 --> 00:10:48.468]  Oh, she got heads that time.
[00:10:48.788 --> 00:10:49.609]  Here, let's just keep flipping.
[00:10:49.889 --> 00:10:51.310]  See, in the real world, there's chance.
[00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.991]  Heads again.
[00:10:52.891 --> 00:10:54.572]  In the real world, that's... Oh, tails.
[00:10:55.713 --> 00:10:57.154]  See, in the real world, it's 50-50.
[00:10:57.875 --> 00:11:00.357]  But see, not in Hillary Clinton world.
[00:11:01.097 --> 00:11:01.838]  Oh, tails again.
[00:11:03.632 --> 00:11:05.153]  Not in Hillary Clinton world.
[00:11:05.733 --> 00:11:22.021]  So just to illustrate how ridiculous it would be to have six in a row, and then all this other hanky-panky, and the app fails magically, so that you don't have the regular tallying system, it just goes into some black hole, and phone calls are made, and then we learn who won.
[00:11:23.393 --> 00:11:31.719]  Now I've already pointed out how the establishment has been pushing for Rubio, but let's look at how the mainstream media is also picking another candidate, Hillary Clinton.
[00:11:32.059 --> 00:11:37.063]  So earlier, Sarah Palin went on the Today Show and they sandbagged her.
[00:11:37.103 --> 00:11:37.984]  They gave her some...
[00:11:39.545 --> 00:11:41.246]  Curveball questioned about her kid.
[00:11:41.606 --> 00:11:55.416]  Well, during a four-minute appearance on the Today Show, the former Secretary of State was not asked a single question about the disturbing new revelations that came out prior to her going on the show, where it said classified emails put lives at risk.
[00:11:55.996 --> 00:11:59.197]  They asked her questions like, oh, did you wake up this morning excited?
[00:11:59.697 --> 00:12:02.778]  And how come you won't just come right out and say that Bernie Sanders can win?
[00:12:03.138 --> 00:12:11.760]  So, and then this article, this is from Breitbart, but they go on to just point out all of the ways that MSNBC has been stumping for Hillary.
[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:18.442]  And, you know, you've got to read this because it just, it just shows how good it must be to be Hillary.
[00:12:18.702 --> 00:12:23.383]  Now, Jakari Jackson took to the streets to ask Austinites who's their favorite candidate.
[00:12:24.437 --> 00:12:31.484]  Last night we saw the results of the Iowa caucus, where Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, and Marco Rubio came in first, second, and third, respectively.
[00:12:31.805 --> 00:12:37.971]  On the Democratic side, we saw Mrs. Clinton have a very narrow, and many people say debated, victory over Bernie Sanders.
[00:12:38.031 --> 00:12:42.516]  So we're here at the University of Texas, and we're going to find out which of the candidates are best for the people here.
[00:12:43.917 --> 00:12:44.518]  Hey, how you doing, sir?
[00:12:44.879 --> 00:12:46.821]  We're asking people who their favorite presidential candidate is.
[00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:48.894]  Uh, Bernie Sanders.
[00:12:49.434 --> 00:12:49.754]  Right now?
[00:12:50.014 --> 00:12:50.175]  Yes.
[00:12:50.555 --> 00:12:52.256]  Probably go with Hillary Clinton or Rubio.
[00:12:52.496 --> 00:12:53.937]  Hillary Clinton or Rubio.
[00:12:54.017 --> 00:12:55.078]  Any particular reasons why?
[00:12:55.418 --> 00:12:57.059]  I want someone more towards the center.
[00:12:57.619 --> 00:12:59.060]  Bernie Sanders, for sure, probably.
[00:12:59.221 --> 00:13:00.701]  Okay, so you're feeling the Bern.
[00:13:00.802 --> 00:13:01.682]  Any particular reason?
[00:13:01.782 --> 00:13:05.445]  Probably as a student, all of his policies about tuition-free college.
[00:13:05.465 --> 00:13:08.607]  I don't know if it'll be possible, but it works for me.
[00:13:09.227 --> 00:13:10.768]  Who would pay for the free tuition?
[00:13:11.769 --> 00:13:13.490]  Hopefully the rich people of America.
[00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.112]  How's he going to pay for all the free stuff that he's
[00:13:17.139 --> 00:13:18.179]  Suggesting he's going to give.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:25.022]  I think, you know, he's going to try like, you know, obviously, you know, use tax money to pay for it.
[00:13:25.502 --> 00:13:28.163]  Not Donald Trump.
[00:13:28.303 --> 00:13:29.064]  Why not the Donald?
[00:13:29.444 --> 00:13:36.126]  I just think he's like, not as involved in politics as he should be in order to be our president.
[00:13:36.446 --> 00:13:37.827]  I feel like he's too business minded.
[00:13:39.567 --> 00:13:40.448]  Bernie Sanders.
[00:13:41.108 --> 00:13:41.888]  Any particular reason?
[00:13:45.009 --> 00:13:47.992]  No, I don't really follow politics, really.
[00:13:48.012 --> 00:13:54.277]  I just don't like Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:54.297 --> 00:13:55.998]  How you doing, miss?
[00:13:56.018 --> 00:13:58.280]  We're asking people who their favorite presidential candidate is.
[00:13:58.861 --> 00:13:59.221]  Hillary.
[00:13:59.481 --> 00:13:59.801]  Hillary?
[00:13:59.981 --> 00:14:00.182]  Yeah.
[00:14:00.362 --> 00:14:01.162]  Any particular reason?
[00:14:02.524 --> 00:14:05.626]  She's a female and everyone else, I don't know.
[00:14:06.107 --> 00:14:13.673]  Not that I'm for... I feel out of all the ones that are candidates right now, she would be the most appropriate, but not ideal.
[00:14:14.352 --> 00:14:14.632]  Okay.
[00:14:14.892 --> 00:14:16.854]  Is there any particular policy that you like about her?
[00:14:18.295 --> 00:14:24.259]  Um... No, I guess just that she's a Democrat.
[00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:27.261]  I guess that'd be the only... Well, why not Bernie if she's a Democrat?
[00:14:28.058 --> 00:14:29.459]  No, because she's female.
[00:14:29.799 --> 00:14:31.139]  So, sorry.
[00:14:31.159 --> 00:14:31.980]  But that's why.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.961]  Anything in particular with Bernie?
[00:14:34.121 --> 00:14:45.126]  Well, I mean, this clear issue of the 1% and the ability of the rich to become richer and not necessarily having a better distribution of wealth in the country.
[00:14:45.166 --> 00:14:47.507]  I think that is a very good conversation to have.
[00:14:47.527 --> 00:14:53.509]  I don't want to put words in your mouth, but my understanding of what you're saying here is that you're supporting Bernie Sanders and his wealth redistribution?
[00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:54.110]  No.
[00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:55.490]  Well, yes, I am.
[00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:55.830]  Yeah.
[00:14:55.991 --> 00:14:56.671]  Why do you like Bernie?
[00:14:57.196 --> 00:14:58.216]  He just seems like a good guy.
[00:14:58.236 --> 00:15:03.079]  You know, he's a socialist, I believe, and I believe in what he stands for.
[00:15:03.439 --> 00:15:15.484]  We had a referendum last year, I don't know if you're aware of it, where Scotland had the opportunity to break free from the United Kingdom, and I was very much in favour of that because we wanted a socialist government.
[00:15:15.544 --> 00:15:24.988]  Let me ask you this, let's say 20 years from now you have that UT education, you have your big career and whatever, and you're doing good, would you be okay paying for somebody else's tuition at that point?
[00:15:25.402 --> 00:15:26.003]  Absolutely.
[00:15:26.023 --> 00:15:30.146]  I think it's the responsibility of the upper class of America to take care of the lower class.
[00:15:30.506 --> 00:15:31.187]  Well there you have it.
[00:15:31.227 --> 00:15:37.812]  The majority of the people we've talked to in the short time we've been here at the University of Texas support the Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders.
[00:15:38.133 --> 00:15:40.635]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:15:48.951 --> 00:15:50.053]  Another question from the audience?
[00:15:50.614 --> 00:15:52.296]  Yeah, kiddanielsinfowars.com.
[00:15:52.537 --> 00:15:55.722]  Dr. Paul, if you could debate Bernie Sanders, what would you say to him?
[00:15:56.383 --> 00:15:59.128]  And what would you say to supporters who think that socialism works?
[00:16:01.323 --> 00:16:02.644]  What would I say to Bernie?
[00:16:02.664 --> 00:16:04.885]  To Bernie and his supporters.
[00:16:04.965 --> 00:16:05.566]  His supporters.
[00:16:06.326 --> 00:16:15.572]  You know, the closest thing I can... Bernie and I got along pretty well and we talked a lot, knew exactly where we stood and respected each other's views.
[00:16:16.193 --> 00:16:20.055]  And I think Bernie might have voted to audit the Fed, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:16:20.075 --> 00:16:20.175]  So he...
[00:16:23.297 --> 00:16:32.881]  So, given the benefit of the doubt, but the closest I came to a real debate with somebody like Bernie Sanders was with Barney Frank up at the University of Pennsylvania.
[00:16:33.561 --> 00:16:40.784]  And the point that I try to make is, you know, you do well as a principled progressive.
[00:16:41.344 --> 00:16:43.665]  And I can do this with Dennis Kucinich.
[00:16:44.941 --> 00:16:46.362]  I know, I know very well.
[00:16:47.943 --> 00:16:55.767]  And say, well, you know, you want, you don't want to use force in the military, you want to protect civil liberties, and you don't like all this war.
[00:16:55.867 --> 00:16:59.829]  And sometimes Dennis and I would be going to voting against some war position.
[00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:04.231]  But I said, why, why propose this to Barney too?
[00:17:04.631 --> 00:17:07.973]  Why is it that you won't apply that same principle
[00:17:08.613 --> 00:17:09.013]  I think?
[00:17:38.813 --> 00:17:40.474]  We're good to go.
[00:18:05.432 --> 00:18:12.776]  But I talked to them, but I have to tell you that so far I haven't converted many diehard progressives.
[00:18:12.836 --> 00:18:21.462]  Because some progressives, if you watch it on the internet, will have really close agreements and they might, you know, be talking about the same issue.
[00:18:21.762 --> 00:18:28.466]  But boy, they don't want to even introduce the notion that the libertarians are with them on this because they're terrified!
[00:18:28.786 --> 00:18:32.849]  That we might encroach on their power to redistribute wealth.
[00:18:33.429 --> 00:18:38.012]  So it's a tough argument, but that's because they have a stronger belief.
[00:18:38.152 --> 00:18:42.795]  Others are sort of in the middle and they can be influenced and they can be converted.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:06.306]  Shane Steiner's involvement with InfoWarsLife.com truly happened in an organic way.
[00:19:06.426 --> 00:19:15.056]  I went to high school with Shane, his brother, knew his parents well, and he was visiting the office once, hadn't been to the office in years, and said, wow, I notice you're making and selling supplements.
[00:19:15.076 --> 00:19:15.816]  Do these really work?
[00:19:15.856 --> 00:19:20.702]  Because I've tried a lot of supplements as a workout enthusiast, and I really think most of them are
[00:19:21.042 --> 00:19:22.443]  I said, here, take some home, try it.
[00:19:22.543 --> 00:19:29.105]  Well, a few weeks later, he came in blown away and said, I want to buy three boxes of this stuff to give my friends and family.
[00:19:29.505 --> 00:19:31.026]  It's simply amazing.
[00:19:31.066 --> 00:19:32.307]  He said, why does it work so well?
[00:19:32.367 --> 00:19:36.888]  And I said, listen, go to Infowarslife.com, watch the informational videos with Dr. Group and others.
[00:19:37.129 --> 00:19:38.609]  They understand how it all works.
[00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:40.470]  I know that it works for me.
[00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:41.730]  That's all I understand.
[00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:47.052]  The science, the facts, the research, people's testimonials, they're all on Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:47.072 --> 00:19:48.033]  You can check it out for yourself.
[00:19:48.633 --> 00:19:49.733]  I wanted to go to the gym.
[00:19:49.994 --> 00:19:59.837]  I wanted to push myself and work out harder, and that led to me being able to come out and do stuff like the barefooting and the surfing and stuff like that, which I would have never done.
[00:19:59.857 --> 00:20:02.378]  I never would have done that two years ago.
[00:20:02.979 --> 00:20:06.600]  Shane has said over and over again, more than just libido and energy,
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.921]  It made him want to get into the gym more.
[00:20:09.261 --> 00:20:10.722]  It made him want to get in better shape.
[00:20:10.762 --> 00:20:13.363]  And believe me, the Steiners have amazing genetics.
[00:20:13.923 --> 00:20:16.364]  His brother is a world champion steer wrestler.
[00:20:16.685 --> 00:20:20.687]  His dad, Bobby Steiner, is a famous world champion bull rider.
[00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:22.547]  They've got natural genetics.
[00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:27.710]  But when you added this to the mix, in Shane's own words, it took him to the next level.
[00:20:40.003 --> 00:20:41.724]  Shane noticed the mental clarity.
[00:20:42.184 --> 00:20:45.646]  Bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass.
[00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.087]  He's already completely shredded.
[00:20:47.287 --> 00:20:49.929]  I gotta admit, for me, the biggest effect has been libido.
[00:20:50.309 --> 00:20:56.353]  Now, I've never claimed to have a body like some beach model, but back when I was 20, 22 years old and worked out every day, I looked great.
[00:20:56.393 --> 00:21:02.396]  But over the years, being married, having three kids, working 18 hours a day, I gained basically 100 pounds.
[00:21:02.556 --> 00:21:05.678]  And it's been a long process of losing that weight in the last four years.
[00:21:05.858 --> 00:21:08.440]  But if you look at the photos and the videos,
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:09.100]  I don't think so.
[00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:37.933]  This has actually made me feel so good that here lately, about a year ago, I started training jiu-jitsu and that kind of led to doing some boxing and kickboxing.
[00:21:37.953 --> 00:21:50.435]  I mean, it's amazing that two years ago I was on the couch and couldn't even tie my shoes and now I'm training with MMA fighters and just doing stuff that I never thought that I would be doing ever again.
[00:21:50.715 --> 00:21:52.556]  So, Supermail Vitality has
[00:21:53.456 --> 00:21:53.977]  I don't know.
[00:22:03.755 --> 00:22:04.195]  You'll love it.
[00:22:48.126 --> 00:22:57.432]  Bottom line folks, you want to discover the power of super male vitality and super female vitality for yourself by visiting InfoWarsLife.com today or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:23:05.219 --> 00:23:12.303]  Well, what might be some good news for Flint residents, the FBI has joined the Flint, Michigan Water Contamination Probe.
[00:23:12.583 --> 00:23:18.247]  Now, they're going to explore whether any laws were broken in this crisis that has, of course, captured international attention.
[00:23:18.647 --> 00:23:23.850]  Federal prosecutors in Michigan are now working with an investigative team that includes the FBI, the U.S.
[00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:26.331]  Postal Inspection Service, the U.S.
[00:23:26.451 --> 00:23:32.015]  EPA, their Office of Inspector General, and the EPA's Criminal Investigation Division.
[00:23:32.535 --> 00:23:39.700]  Now, of course, their governor there, he's been apologizing repeatedly for the state's poor handling of this crisis.
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:53.489]  And Peter Henning, who is a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, he's also a former federal prosecutor, he said it would be a challenge to bring criminal charges, though Michigan state law does provide some more options.
[00:23:54.010 --> 00:24:00.034]  Specifically, he cites Michigan's misconduct in office law and neglect of duty misdemeanor offense.
[00:24:00.754 --> 00:24:08.304]  Now, in Washington, the Senate is expected to vote this week on an amendment to an energy bill that is sponsored by Michigan Democratic Senators.
[00:24:09.245 --> 00:24:12.489]  It'll provide up to $600 million to Flint.
[00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.593]  They're going to help replace the pipes and provide health care.
[00:24:16.434 --> 00:24:22.119]  And this article says that the measure faces an uphill battle in the Republican-led chamber.
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:29.446]  So, of course, this is another opportunity for all of you activists out there, everyone who's been concerned, all of you celebrities who sent water.
[00:24:29.766 --> 00:24:34.070]  Well, now it's time to take the extra mile, stay on these people, keep their feet to the fire.
[00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:34.871]  And, of course,
[00:24:35.191 --> 00:24:39.855]  Keep calling your state reps and telling them to demand they do something for Flint.
[00:24:40.395 --> 00:24:50.664]  Now, Lord knows we waste taxpayer money on all sorts of other crazy things, and of course, you know, I'd love to call on the auto industry, who destroyed and decimated Flint, Michigan.
[00:24:50.704 --> 00:24:54.087]  Of course, the taxpayers bailed you out billions of dollars.
[00:24:54.427 --> 00:25:01.313]  I feel like the least you could do is, you know, and you don't pay taxes here in the country, so the least you could do is help out Flint.
[00:25:01.653 --> 00:25:02.954]  I'm going to put that call out there.
[00:25:03.294 --> 00:25:06.115]  Now here's something else that really pissed me off when I read it today.
[00:25:06.475 --> 00:25:07.976]  Parents are suing a school.
[00:25:08.296 --> 00:25:13.358]  They forced her daughter to convert to Islam for one of her assignments.
[00:25:13.799 --> 00:25:15.199]  So these are parents in Maryland.
[00:25:15.519 --> 00:25:22.703]  They're suing a public school administrators over concerns that a classroom lesson attempted to indoctrinate their daughter into the Islamic faith.
[00:25:23.223 --> 00:25:25.365]  Now we have obtained these court documents.
[00:25:25.385 --> 00:25:27.427]  They're linked in this article up at InfoWars.
[00:25:27.847 --> 00:25:33.632]  So they're saying that they were assigned lessons and homework in her 11th grade world history class.
[00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:41.438]  It required students to profess statements on the teachings and beliefs of Islam in written worksheets as graded homework assignments.
[00:25:42.273 --> 00:25:46.594]  They were instructed that most Muslims' faith is stronger than the average Christian.
[00:25:46.954 --> 00:25:51.616]  They also had to profess the Shahada, which is basically saying there is no God but Allah.
[00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:55.837]  And of course the family took issue with this because they're Christians.
[00:25:56.457 --> 00:26:04.260]  And they say that their daughter was also instructed that Jihad is a holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty.
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:12.222]  They had to read text from the Quran and learn and recite the five pillars of Islam.
[00:26:12.242 --> 00:26:14.043]  So this went on for two weeks in this class.
[00:26:14.443 --> 00:26:19.685]  And they say, in contrast, they spent about a day discussing Christianity, but they never covered the Bible.
[00:26:19.745 --> 00:26:21.286]  They never talked about the Ten Commandments.
[00:26:21.586 --> 00:26:25.487]  I'm sure they didn't talk about Buddhism or Hinduism or any other religions.
[00:26:25.888 --> 00:26:26.768]  Why two weeks?
[00:26:26.968 --> 00:26:28.749]  Why is this a world history assignment?
[00:26:28.829 --> 00:26:32.890]  Why is this happening again and again in classrooms nationwide?
[00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.111]  What is going on here?
[00:26:34.171 --> 00:26:34.731]  If they had
[00:26:34.991 --> 00:26:40.561]  Well, if they had made the class recite the Ten Commandments, they probably would have been sued as we've seen again and again.
[00:26:40.661 --> 00:26:43.606]  What happened to the whole separation of church and state argument?
[00:26:43.826 --> 00:26:45.630]  Of course you're not hearing it here.
[00:26:46.131 --> 00:26:47.573]  What is going on?
[00:26:48.993 --> 00:26:57.816]  Now something else that's also really confusing and a lot of people are now calling out the Feds for this, our Governor Greg Abbott and the U.S.
[00:26:57.876 --> 00:26:59.076]  Representative Henry Quaylar.
[00:26:59.776 --> 00:27:06.279]  The Department of Homeland Security has announced that they are going to reduce aerial surveillance on the Texas border by 50%.
[00:27:07.719 --> 00:27:11.061]  And this is at a time when we know that the border is wide open.
[00:27:11.361 --> 00:27:13.843]  There's a huge surge happening here.
[00:27:14.443 --> 00:27:21.408]  And they go on to point out that we've had a huge surge in migrants from Central America and Cuba along the southern border.
[00:27:21.748 --> 00:27:27.672]  So they're saying the DHS should actually be increasing surveillance and security resources, not fewer.
[00:27:28.032 --> 00:27:32.915]  They're citing instances of 115 percent increase since 2014 in undocumented immigrants crossing.
[00:27:37.278 --> 00:27:43.680]  The amount of family units coming over has increased by 170% and the El Paso sector reports an increase of almost 300% in unaccompanied minors.
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.281]  So indeed, what is going on here?
[00:27:54.281 --> 00:28:02.285]  Well America, if you haven't noticed, Middle Eastern and African refugees are raping, looting, and killing all over Europe.
[00:28:02.465 --> 00:28:14.811]  And the European establishment is condemning the citizens on their behavior, rather than that of the invading hordes of fraudulent young male refugees who claim to be fleeing war-ravaged hellholes.
[00:28:29.086 --> 00:28:32.807]  For years now, those refugees have been coming to America.
[00:28:33.208 --> 00:28:36.289]  But it hasn't been large cities like Washington D.C.
[00:28:36.349 --> 00:28:39.350]  and San Francisco due to their high cost of living.
[00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:48.253]  It's smaller American cities that are being targeted to become refugee sanctuary cities, exactly as tiny European towns had been targeted.
[00:28:48.473 --> 00:29:06.708]  Rather than integrate all of the refugees into large cities where aid facilities are better funded and menial jobs may be more plentiful, the Obama administration has been directing pockets of the refugees into smaller to medium-sized American cities that are already struggling to survive.
[00:29:07.208 --> 00:29:26.375]  Cities like Missoula, Montana, Twin Falls, Idaho, and Stone Mountain, Georgia, a population of 6,025, where a huge boon to the economy is the tourism generated by the Stone Mountain carving of Confederate generals, the very historical monument the liberals want destroyed.
[00:29:26.635 --> 00:29:31.077]  It was revealed around this time last year by political analyst Susan Payne,
[00:29:31.277 --> 00:29:37.600]  Who had inadvertently been allowed to attend an Obama White House conference call on the Syrian refugee strategy.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:55.489]  Payne discovered that the intent of the Obama administration is to grow the Muslim seedling communities, in their words, into larger entities, eventually overtaking the smaller cities they had been given sanctuary in, as part of the greater plan to overtake the host nation.
[00:29:55.769 --> 00:29:57.050]  The Obama task force
[00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:04.152]  Even discussed replacing the Thanksgiving holiday with Celebrate Immigrant Day by executive order.
[00:30:04.352 --> 00:30:15.855]  Their main directive being that these 15 million plus new Americans will replace the old Americans and grow as a separate nation within the United States.
[00:30:16.255 --> 00:30:28.290]  Obama established the Task Force on New Americans in November of 2014 in the wake of a complete breakdown of our immigration system under Obama's unconstitutional executive orders.
[00:30:28.681 --> 00:30:41.090]  As of today, there are well over 180,000 criminal illegal immigrants freely wandering around the United States committing new crimes every day, according to ICE agents and members of Congress.
[00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:48.776]  Meanwhile, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson has issued an order to diminish aerial surveillance on the Texas border.
[00:30:49.036 --> 00:30:56.423]  This, after Governor Abbott requested more surveillance last September, a request that was obviously ignored.
[00:30:56.604 --> 00:31:07.735]  The Rio Grande Valley has seen an increase of 115% in unaccompanied minors, while the El Paso border has increased by 300%, and over 28,000 Cubans entered the United States in 2015, twice the number the year before.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:24.450]  America is no longer economically sound enough to cushion the blow of millions of refugees that actually hate everything we represent and our tax dollars pay for.
[00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:26.752]  What have I got to talk to you about?
[00:31:27.483 --> 00:31:28.464]  What have I got to talk to you about?
[00:31:28.484 --> 00:31:30.005]  You haven't got to say about Islam and that, innit?
[00:31:30.025 --> 00:31:30.565]  Yeah, I have, yeah.
[00:31:30.585 --> 00:31:30.905]  Yeah?
[00:31:31.285 --> 00:31:32.246]  So why don't you say it now?
[00:31:32.426 --> 00:31:33.467]  What do you want me to say?
[00:31:33.487 --> 00:31:34.187]  It's a s*** ideology.
[00:31:34.207 --> 00:31:34.687]  It's got no place.
[00:31:34.707 --> 00:31:34.788]  Yeah?
[00:31:34.808 --> 00:31:35.888]  Yeah, it's got no place, bruv.
[00:31:35.908 --> 00:31:36.909]  I don't know what you're like, bruv.
[00:31:36.929 --> 00:31:38.210]  You have about a hundred of you here in a minute.
[00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:39.550]  You f***ing little cheat!
[00:31:57.196 --> 00:32:08.182]  The middle class is aggressively shrinking, we've lost millions of jobs due to international trade deals, cities are going bankrupt, and the national debt is at a record $19 trillion.
[00:32:08.402 --> 00:32:17.067]  Meanwhile, as 31 governors oppose the acceptance of Syrian refugees into their states, the remaining balance of our nation's officials
[00:32:17.287 --> 00:32:23.552]  Well, coming up, we're going to tell you about some new smart toys that are totally hackable.
[00:32:23.572 --> 00:32:24.833]  Didn't see that one coming.
[00:32:24.873 --> 00:32:31.258]  And also, we're going to re-air an Alex Jones prediction from about 10 years ago and show you how it ties into what's happening present day.
[00:32:31.278 --> 00:32:31.558]  Stick around.
[00:33:02.193 --> 00:33:11.459]  You guys have the exclusive for which is a product called Deep Cleanse and why I'm so excited about it is it's a unique formula almost like the iodine crystals.
[00:33:11.539 --> 00:33:15.301]  We have two unique products that nobody in the world has.
[00:33:15.701 --> 00:33:27.488]  One of the most amazing ingredients in the world and it's called Shilajit and it's actually known as blood of the mountain or rock sweat because thousands of years ago as a matter of fact this ingredient
[00:33:27.668 --> 00:33:30.490]  Was only given to the elite of the elite.
[00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:34.092]  Thousands of years ago, up in the Himalayan mountains and in Tibet.
[00:33:34.112 --> 00:33:37.935]  And we wanted to put this in stuff for a couple years, but we couldn't get an organic form.
[00:33:38.115 --> 00:33:38.335]  Right.
[00:33:38.435 --> 00:33:39.476]  I mean, let's explain.
[00:33:39.516 --> 00:33:42.658]  I mean, this stuff's so good, we couldn't put it out for years.
[00:33:42.938 --> 00:33:51.387]  Right, so I had to actually, it's kind of like the iodine crystals, finding a source deep in the earth that we could get the cleanest source available.
[00:33:51.827 --> 00:34:01.397]  But in Tibet and in Nepal and in the Himalayan mountains, thousands of years ago they found, they watched these monkeys and during the summer months the monkeys would go up into the mountains.
[00:34:01.418 --> 00:34:02.659]  Now you're being racist against monkeys.
[00:34:02.699 --> 00:34:03.340]  And they would pick
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.242]  This black substance from the mountains.
[00:34:06.702 --> 00:34:13.207]  And so in Russia, they actually, it grows in Russia and the mountains and in the Himalayas and only in the summer.
[00:34:13.307 --> 00:34:21.514]  And Shilajit is actually the decomposition of seven, up to 7,000 different medicinal herbs.
[00:34:21.574 --> 00:34:28.239]  So it decomposes, all these different herbs decompose in the Himalayan mountains and the volcanic soil up there.
[00:34:28.499 --> 00:34:32.522]  And what happens in the summertime... So it's almost like an oil from
[00:34:33.383 --> 00:34:36.085]  Yes, it's high in fulvic acid, it's high in humic acid.
[00:34:36.125 --> 00:34:40.449]  Because they're always claiming oil is really from decomposed animals and plants.
[00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:45.433]  There is some oil that is based from fossils, but most of it's really abiotic.
[00:34:45.854 --> 00:34:49.837]  So this is a true fossil source?
[00:34:49.917 --> 00:34:50.618]  I mean, explain it to me.
[00:34:51.318 --> 00:34:51.658]  It is.
[00:34:52.058 --> 00:34:57.379]  It's really the decomposition, like I said, of over 7,000 different medicinal herbs and plants.
[00:34:57.539 --> 00:35:01.340]  And with the rocks and the pressure deep in the mountains, it freezes.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:06.361]  And during the summertime and the pressures build it up, it oozes out.
[00:35:06.461 --> 00:35:08.021]  So it literally oozes out of the mountain.
[00:35:08.041 --> 00:35:08.861]  It's like rock sap.
[00:35:09.221 --> 00:35:10.222]  It's like rock sap.
[00:35:10.262 --> 00:35:13.402]  It's black and it's highly nutritious.
[00:35:14.222 --> 00:35:16.843]  Even in the 1980s, when the Olympic
[00:35:17.563 --> 00:35:19.884]  Athletes in Russia were accused of being on steroids.
[00:35:19.924 --> 00:35:27.265]  They found out that they were actually been given Shilajit because it works as an anabolic as well and it builds muscles.
[00:35:27.465 --> 00:35:28.525]  It's a big dose in there.
[00:35:28.545 --> 00:35:38.268]  The second big main ingredient in there is a volcanic zeolite concentrate and what this formula is designed to do, the Shilajit and the zeolites have a real strong negative charge.
[00:35:38.728 --> 00:35:43.649]  All the metals and chemicals and PCBs and VOCs have positive charges.
[00:35:44.449 --> 00:35:52.559]  So these go in, they grab it, and then they safely eliminate it through the body so you can become healthy.
[00:35:52.599 --> 00:35:56.543]  I mean, this is an amazing formula.
[00:35:56.683 --> 00:36:02.550]  I wish I actually had it, but because this was an exclusive InfoWars Life product, you're the only one in the world that has.
[00:36:03.171 --> 00:36:11.075]  This formula now and you know there is going to be a limited supply available when you sell out because you can only harvest this once a year.
[00:36:11.235 --> 00:36:12.275]  How do people take it?
[00:36:12.335 --> 00:36:14.656]  How is it recommended that this be done?
[00:36:14.756 --> 00:36:16.477]  Just a daily dose?
[00:36:16.737 --> 00:36:18.458]  Yeah, daily dose.
[00:36:18.558 --> 00:36:19.919]  The instructions are on the label.
[00:36:19.959 --> 00:36:22.400]  You know of course I kind of modify it for
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.942]  It depends on what your lifestyle is.
[00:36:24.982 --> 00:36:33.407]  I mean, honestly, the best thing to do is for you to avoid all these chemicals and toxins in your environment and try to identify them and start slowly reducing them.
[00:36:33.868 --> 00:36:41.553]  But personally, I'm going to probably take it every day, every other day, and I'll probably go with about a dropper full to maybe two dropper fulls.
[00:36:42.694 --> 00:36:44.936]  And I don't expose myself to any chemicals.

[00:36:59.509 --> 00:37:00.470]  So support them folks.
[00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:01.271]  This is a war.
[00:37:05.799 --> 00:37:13.384]  The top three appear to be Trump, Cruz and Rubio with Rand Paul moving up quite a bit this last week.
[00:37:13.404 --> 00:37:18.547]  It looks like the fact that Donald Trump skipped this last debate really seemed to help Rand Paul.
[00:37:18.608 --> 00:37:29.575]  First, it moved him up considerably in the polls when he was left out of that first debate because he utilized that time very wisely to take questions on social media.
[00:37:30.135 --> 00:37:36.781]  And to talk about issues in a thoughtful way that would not be allowed in a debate, as sad as that is.
[00:37:36.821 --> 00:37:40.164]  The debates really don't cover much in terms of issues.
[00:37:40.204 --> 00:37:43.367]  They don't allow... What's your favorite fantasy football team?
[00:37:43.507 --> 00:37:44.328]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:44.348 --> 00:37:53.116]  They don't allow the candidates to get out of this really tiny, narrowly defined set of issues that they talk about, not only every election cycle, but every one of the debates.
[00:37:53.176 --> 00:37:54.417]  Tell us what your tax plan is.
[00:37:54.497 --> 00:37:54.917]  We're good to go.
[00:38:13.749 --> 00:38:29.557]  So he had a bump in the poll then, and then when Trump set out this last debate, it allowed a more serious discussion of some issues because Trump wasn't dominating the debate as he always does, and so Rand Paul was able to talk about some of the issues.
[00:38:29.597 --> 00:38:38.701]  So with those two turns of events, he's moved up in the polls where I'm certainly hopeful that he's going to have a stronger showing in this, because I would like to see somebody
[00:38:39.201 --> 00:38:49.984]  He was talking about genuine libertarian issues, things like controlling the surveillance state, not setting up suicidal World War III triggers all around the world with no-fly zones.
[00:38:50.024 --> 00:38:55.845]  He's the only one who has any sense in the Republican Party in terms of the no-fly zones.
[00:38:55.985 --> 00:39:01.187]  Donald Trump is a little bit hesitant about that kind of setting on the fence, but only Rand Paul says
[00:39:01.707 --> 00:39:02.788]  This is madness.
[00:39:02.848 --> 00:39:05.169]  This is Dr. Strangelove level madness.
[00:39:05.209 --> 00:39:07.210]  The other guys just want to rush full on.
[00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:11.312]  They don't think that Obama has done enough in terms of the number of wars that we've gotten ourselves involved in.
[00:39:11.332 --> 00:39:14.254]  Well, they want to make sure that the military-industrial complex is well fed.
[00:39:14.374 --> 00:39:14.854]  That's right.
[00:39:14.994 --> 00:39:15.355]  That's right.
[00:39:15.735 --> 00:39:28.582]  And so that's one of the things that has hurt Rand Paul is that, you know, he's really kind of a guy without, a man without a country in a sense, because a non-interventionist foreign policy is not something that sells well in either party.
[00:39:29.062 --> 00:39:33.004]  Both parties really want to have a war, really war parties.
[00:39:33.244 --> 00:39:36.325]  Now guys, I have a special guest I want to bring here in studio.
[00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:41.467]  You guys know Mrs. Clinton has been out there on the campaign trail and she's been very busy.
[00:39:41.487 --> 00:39:43.407]  She's too busy to go watch the Benghazi movie.
[00:39:43.708 --> 00:39:46.369]  But if you're watching this right now, Mrs. Clinton is in studio.
[00:39:46.569 --> 00:39:48.049]  She looks hot today, too.
[00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:48.870]  She looks hot today.
[00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:50.070]  Hi there, Jakari Jackson.
[00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:52.531]  Oh, you got your southern accent going on.
[00:39:52.731 --> 00:39:53.553]  I am in Texas.
[00:39:53.613 --> 00:39:54.495]  I'm caucusing from here.
[00:39:54.535 --> 00:39:55.217]  That's how good I am.
[00:39:55.237 --> 00:39:56.981]  You go check the polls right now.
[00:39:57.221 --> 00:39:58.204]  It doesn't even really matter.
[00:39:58.264 --> 00:39:59.447]  I mean, you already know I won.
[00:39:59.467 --> 00:40:00.990]  I took all the money from George Soros.
[00:40:02.995 --> 00:40:06.979]  Well, Mrs. Clinton, we've had a... I think you forgot to shave.
[00:40:07.019 --> 00:40:12.405]  Well, it's all that Monsanto they keep giving me over there, and I didn't know it was going to have that effect.
[00:40:12.485 --> 00:40:14.027]  I mean, this is really a wig.
[00:40:14.087 --> 00:40:17.010]  I'm bald, but, you know, the beard, it's all coming out.
[00:40:17.731 --> 00:40:19.092]  You ain't no ways tired.
[00:40:19.132 --> 00:40:23.757]  Now, Mrs. Clinton, I know you're in no ways tired, but, you know, people have been concerned about your health.
[00:40:23.797 --> 00:40:25.098]  You're showing up late to debates.
[00:40:28.577 --> 00:40:30.959]  Are you sure you fell enough?
[00:40:31.059 --> 00:40:34.001]  I'm a little lightheaded, but I think that's the Monsanto too as well.
[00:40:34.082 --> 00:40:35.643]  It's not from when you fell and hit your head?
[00:40:36.083 --> 00:40:45.830]  No, Mrs. Clinton, you were in the, it wasn't a debate, but it was a forum where somebody asked you about your husband's activities, about the allegations of all the victims.
[00:40:46.291 --> 00:40:49.833]  Do you have any concern that may impact your campaign?
[00:40:50.654 --> 00:40:51.775]  What difference does it make?
[00:40:54.497 --> 00:40:55.538]  I'm going to win anyways.
[00:40:57.152 --> 00:40:59.293]  I mean, I'm caucusing from Texas.
[00:40:59.554 --> 00:41:00.214]  I'm already winning.
[00:41:00.274 --> 00:41:01.215]  I don't even have to be there.
[00:41:01.635 --> 00:41:01.955]  Come on.
[00:41:02.255 --> 00:41:02.735]  Well, you are.
[00:41:02.755 --> 00:41:05.937]  Let's take a look at your polls.
[00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:08.659]  I'm sure my caucus has turned out really nice.
[00:41:09.119 --> 00:41:12.721]  Right now, the numbers are still pretty loose.
[00:41:13.021 --> 00:41:13.522]  What do you think?
[00:41:14.062 --> 00:41:15.763]  Once again, being beaten by a man.
[00:41:15.783 --> 00:41:17.544]  It's a real possibility here.
[00:41:17.584 --> 00:41:18.805]  Who said that I was a woman?
[00:41:20.506 --> 00:41:22.327]  I've been fooling all y'all for a long time.
[00:41:22.547 --> 00:41:23.688]  Clinton's little secret.
[00:41:23.748 --> 00:41:24.408]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:41:25.407 --> 00:41:27.148]  Victoria's not the only one with a secret.
[00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:36.916]  Well, I'm gonna go back over here and try to continue to get people Hillary for President, and I see you guys, you keep wearing those Hillary for Prison t-shirts.
[00:41:36.936 --> 00:41:38.076]  Those things really make me angry.
[00:41:38.397 --> 00:41:38.637]  Alright.
[00:41:38.657 --> 00:41:40.338]  Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Clinton.
[00:41:41.779 --> 00:41:45.302]  Okay, so... Well, hopefully she's not back in our IT department.
[00:41:46.022 --> 00:41:47.703]  I think Alex is ready to join us now.
[00:41:47.804 --> 00:41:47.964]  Alex?
[00:41:49.551 --> 00:41:51.092]  Well, you're absolutely right, David.
[00:41:51.132 --> 00:41:54.615]  We have entered the national security state, and it doesn't make us secure.
[00:41:55.355 --> 00:41:56.917]  It makes us less secure.
[00:41:57.677 --> 00:42:00.719]  And that's what it was always designed to do.
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:16.792]  What we're doing, elites and banking families, is take technologies of social control used in the third world, in Southeast Asia, in Latin America, in Africa, in Eastern Europe, and they have exported those now directly against the people of Europe and the United States.
[00:42:17.791 --> 00:42:46.563]  As they blow up the engine of liberty and free market innovation and development that gave them the combustion engine, the equations to create atomic weapons and power, that gave them the Wright Brothers, the Kitty Hawks, that gave them the power to create the internet, they've now stolen the Promethean fire of the grassroots, middle class, and working class people of every race, color, and creed in the American melting pot.
[00:42:48.343 --> 00:43:00.966]  And they have now basically come in and taken control of that system that are in a breakaway civilization right now.
[00:43:00.986 --> 00:43:03.047]  And so that's what's happening.
[00:43:04.107 --> 00:43:16.371]  This is really a question of does the elite really want to use technology and systems of control to dumb everybody down and stop the Promethean fire of progress from trans people?
[00:43:18.539 --> 00:43:27.390]  Or to be truly enlightened, folks, and believe in humanity, and that if you're so enlightened, you shouldn't be afraid of other people being enlightened as well.
[00:43:28.697 --> 00:43:32.818]  Well, one of her defenses is to say, well, what the State Department has done is over-classified this stuff.
[00:43:32.838 --> 00:43:33.818]  And it's like, you know what, Hillary?
[00:43:34.258 --> 00:43:36.979]  You don't get to make that determination.
[00:43:37.519 --> 00:43:37.819]  Okay?
[00:43:37.859 --> 00:43:41.400]  That's like, you know, if I was to get pulled over by the police for speeding, I would say, you know what?
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.680]  These speed limits are just too low.
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:43.400]  Let me go.
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:49.541]  And of course, I'm not going to get away with that, but she's going to get away with that because her last name is Clinton.
[00:43:50.362 --> 00:43:51.842]  And she can just continue to lie.
[00:43:52.102 --> 00:43:58.686]  And to say that she was never, I mean, she was never assigned a state.gov email address so everybody knew.
[00:43:58.746 --> 00:44:03.148]  It's not that she was given the option and then, oh, I just decided to use this one because it was easier.
[00:44:03.168 --> 00:44:09.612]  No, this was a deliberate means with which to bypass the federal records management there in the government.
[00:44:09.632 --> 00:44:10.673]  This was premeditated.
[00:44:10.973 --> 00:44:23.161]  Well, if these are over classified, then what she needs to do is just call up her former employees at the State Department and give them the same instructions that she used to give them via email and say, well, I want you to send this information to me.
[00:44:23.241 --> 00:44:30.265]  So if it says classified on the top, just cover that up and copy it over and send it on the fax machine anyway.
[00:44:30.285 --> 00:44:30.885]  Like with a cloth?
[00:44:31.806 --> 00:44:34.488]  Yeah, cut and paste this so that you can get this to me.
[00:44:34.588 --> 00:44:35.548]  I want you to send this to me.
[00:44:35.588 --> 00:44:37.669]  I don't care if it's secure or not.
[00:44:37.709 --> 00:44:40.351]  Just get that top secret classification off the top.
[00:44:40.391 --> 00:44:42.852]  And that's essentially what she's told the State Department now.
[00:44:42.972 --> 00:44:44.853]  Right, and that's the kind of president that she's going to be.
[00:44:44.913 --> 00:44:46.194]  What difference does it make?
[00:44:46.554 --> 00:44:52.417]  Cut all the corners and for your personal convenience, because she said it's just easier to have it on her phone.
[00:44:52.738 --> 00:44:54.819]  Not that you couldn't access it from the phone either, right?
[00:44:54.979 --> 00:44:57.000]  She had three phones, an iPad, a laptop.
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:00.602]  Didn't she have like a book that she put out that had a picture of her using her phone or a Blackberry?
[00:45:00.762 --> 00:45:04.303]  That was on the back of her bus, actually, when she was there for her book tour.
[00:45:04.843 --> 00:45:07.404]  They had a picture on the back of her bus with her shade.
[00:45:07.524 --> 00:45:12.745]  She was looking down at the phone like, you know, I'm so cool and I'm so trendy because I've got a cell phone.
[00:45:12.785 --> 00:45:15.046]  It's like, well, that's right, it's kind of trendy 15 years ago.
[00:45:15.066 --> 00:45:15.686]  That's it right there.
[00:45:15.706 --> 00:45:18.447]  It's the famous picture with her BlackBerry.
[00:45:18.847 --> 00:45:21.768]  But when she came out and said, I only had an iPhone.
[00:45:21.788 --> 00:45:24.489]  And then it's like, well, what about the BlackBerry also?
[00:45:25.569 --> 00:45:27.351]  He just lies and lies and lies.
[00:45:27.371 --> 00:45:28.572]  But what difference does it make?
[00:45:43.648 --> 00:45:48.332]  They said, Donald Trump has called your dad an abuser of women and your mom his enabler.
[00:45:48.793 --> 00:45:50.834]  What do you think of his attacks on your parents?
[00:45:50.954 --> 00:45:58.741]  She said, I find what Donald Trump and many of the Republicans, because it's not only Mr. Trump, say about Americans is far more troubling than what he says about my parents.
[00:45:59.461 --> 00:46:04.726]  It isn't Donald Trump that is saying that about your mom and your dad.
[00:46:05.006 --> 00:46:07.889]  It's the people that your dad abused.
[00:46:07.929 --> 00:46:12.693]  That very long list of supposed victims are saying that Donald Trump is just repeating it.
[00:46:13.013 --> 00:46:13.473]  Exactly.
[00:46:13.513 --> 00:46:21.761]  The people that are claiming that they were sexually molested, harassed, and raped by Bill Clinton, and then saying that Hillary Clinton made it even worse.
[00:46:21.821 --> 00:46:23.102]  And so they're the ones who are saying it.
[00:46:23.402 --> 00:46:24.263]  It's not Donald Trump.
[00:46:24.463 --> 00:46:25.384]  It's not the Republicans.
[00:46:25.524 --> 00:46:26.946]  It's the victims, Hillary.
[00:46:27.166 --> 00:46:32.572]  But then she goes on to go right down all the typical Democrat shibboleths in one sentence.
[00:46:32.612 --> 00:46:41.401]  She says this is broad-based misogyny and sexism and racism and Islamophobia and jingoism and homophobia and anti-immigrant rhetoric.
[00:46:41.501 --> 00:46:42.582]  I'm quoting her directly.
[00:46:42.762 --> 00:46:44.883]  I mean, that's what she says, okay?
[00:46:45.263 --> 00:46:46.264]  Every one of the labels.
[00:46:46.284 --> 00:46:50.485]  She's like a robot who was like, glitch, glitch, glitch, just spitting out all those buzzwords.
[00:46:50.505 --> 00:46:52.226]  It's this and this and this and this and this and this.
[00:46:52.266 --> 00:46:52.886]  Now I'm done.
[00:46:53.427 --> 00:46:54.587]  I've toasted these guys.
[00:46:54.627 --> 00:46:56.228]  I've thrown every label at them.
[00:46:56.248 --> 00:46:58.729]  She ran through all of her talking points and now she has nothing else to say.
[00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:08.955]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you can get six months free at PrisonPlanet.tv, but only for one more week.
[00:47:09.135 --> 00:47:12.398]  Next Monday, the special that only comes around once the year ends.
[00:47:12.458 --> 00:47:23.447]  In fact, we've never offered six months free before, but I really want to get more people to join and be able to watch The Nightly News, to see the live reports we do, the special reports, all my films, e-books, and so much more.
[00:47:24.048 --> 00:47:26.830]  One person can share their membership with 20 people.
[00:47:27.751 --> 00:47:35.933]  And you are funding the absolute, very leading edge, the vanguard of the resistance to the globalist operation on every front.
[00:47:36.033 --> 00:47:40.694]  We have to have our own platform that is harder for them to censor, harder for the system to shut down.
[00:47:40.854 --> 00:47:42.494]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:47:42.594 --> 00:47:48.135]  We put out the daily radio show free with a video and audio feeds at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:47:48.275 --> 00:47:56.277]  But it is the members that get the nightly news exclusively and first and the commercial free video podcasts and audio podcasts that are
[00:47:56.397 --> 00:48:13.139]  Paying it forward and financing and helping so many other people see the truth when we put the videos on Facebook, YouTube, and it's PrisonPlanet.tv that finances so much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew, the reporters.
[00:48:13.459 --> 00:48:16.503]  You are becoming a PrisonPlanet.tv member.

[00:48:29.517 --> 00:48:30.659]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:48:32.952 --> 00:48:34.293]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:48:34.593 --> 00:48:35.874]  You can't survive without it.
[00:48:36.074 --> 00:48:36.975]  But where do you get it?
[00:48:37.275 --> 00:48:43.059]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.

[00:49:06.715 --> 00:49:10.799]  Well, this segment is sort of going to be an I told you so segment.
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:15.764]  Now, I called this months ago when I sort of saw some rumblings there within the military.
[00:49:16.364 --> 00:49:22.430]  Obviously, relatively soon, they are going to have equality within the military service.
[00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:23.451]  So I said,
[00:49:23.931 --> 00:49:27.514]  Just the next thing on the agenda will be drafting women into the military.
[00:49:27.814 --> 00:49:37.141]  So now the Army and Marine Corps, one of their top uniformed leaders, is backing making women register for the draft as all combat roles are open to them in the coming months.
[00:49:37.662 --> 00:49:43.206]  So this is Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley and Marine Corps Commandant General Robert Neller.
[00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:49.972]  They told senators during a Capitol Hill hearing that full integration of these jobs is likely going to take a few years.
[00:49:50.672 --> 00:49:53.733]  To overcome some logistical and cultural issues.
[00:49:54.273 --> 00:49:58.334]  One of those complications is going to be how to handle the Selective Service System.
[00:49:58.814 --> 00:50:00.795]  Women in the past have always been exempt.
[00:50:01.735 --> 00:50:06.756]  And, you know, they said that they point to challenges on restrictions on the battlefield.
[00:50:07.256 --> 00:50:08.817]  But that reasoning is now moot.
[00:50:09.057 --> 00:50:12.138]  So lawmakers are going to need to determine what becomes of the system.
[00:50:13.158 --> 00:50:15.680]  This is not about equality, stupid!
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:22.467]  Now, regardless of what you've heard, men cannot repopulate a country after war.
[00:50:22.607 --> 00:50:25.690]  That is why women are not drafted into the military.
[00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:27.811]  Who is going to repopulate the nation?
[00:50:28.352 --> 00:50:33.176]  Even if you have a new plastic vagina, you cannot have a baby.
[00:50:33.737 --> 00:50:35.458]  That's why women did not join the draft.
[00:50:35.538 --> 00:50:36.359]  But you know what?
[00:50:36.439 --> 00:50:38.962]  I'm a conspiracy theorist, so who knows in the future.
[00:50:39.602 --> 00:50:40.223]  Men might be able
[00:50:57.202 --> 00:51:02.106]  Also, it reported on all the baby monitors that were being turned into spy cameras from strangers.
[00:51:02.466 --> 00:51:11.713]  So now, in September, Mattel's Fisher-Price brand announced that it had partnered with a tech company to make Smart Toy, a stuffed bear that can learn a three-year-old's name.
[00:51:12.094 --> 00:51:13.475]  Naturally, it's hackable.
[00:51:13.855 --> 00:51:26.805]  So researchers at a Boston-based security company found that the app connected to the toy had several security flaws that would allow a hacker to steal a child's name, birthdate, and gender, along with other data.
[00:51:27.245 --> 00:51:43.286]  So you're saying oh well that's you know whatever just their name and birth date and all of that but as you know commonly used people use their child name or their birth date for their passwords to get into their bank accounts I know I have
[00:51:43.786 --> 00:51:44.126]  I think so.
[00:52:03.724 --> 00:52:10.327]  Even the simplest thing like your child's name, date, and gender is a very valuable tool to someone who means to do harm.
[00:52:11.028 --> 00:52:12.408]  And here's another prediction.
[00:52:12.428 --> 00:52:24.074]  Now I'm going to say, when I first watched Endgame about 10 years ago, Alex Jones, he's narrating it, and then all of a sudden it flips to how the elite are going to merge with machines and live forever.
[00:52:24.154 --> 00:52:26.975]  And I was like, whoa, I thought we were talking about politics here.
[00:52:27.035 --> 00:52:27.655]  What happened?
[00:52:27.976 --> 00:52:28.216]  Left.
[00:52:29.036 --> 00:52:35.398]  And now here, lo and behold, they're saying, is technology causing us to evolve into a new species?
[00:52:35.939 --> 00:52:41.781]  Experts believe superhumans called homo optimus will talk to machines and be digitally immortal by 2050.
[00:52:41.881 --> 00:52:48.863]  They say if you're under 40, there's a good chance you're going to achieve electronic immortality during your lifetime.
[00:52:49.223 --> 00:52:53.685]  All your thoughts and experiences will be uploaded and stored online for future generations.
[00:52:54.365 --> 00:52:55.606]  And they even predict that
[00:52:56.366 --> 00:53:04.032]  Within the next 35 years, humans will live online, and our pets could even talk to us like real-life Furbies.
[00:53:04.452 --> 00:53:17.983]  Now, these predictions were made by Dr. Ian Pearson as part of the lead-up to the Big Bang Fair, and he says with optimized genomes and bodies enhanced by links to external technology, people could be more beautiful, more intelligent,
[00:53:18.323 --> 00:53:26.628]  More emotionally sophisticated, more physically able, more socially connected, and generally healthier and happier all around.
[00:53:27.008 --> 00:53:39.696]  And yes, we could be robots, because we've seen how all the connections we've made on social media have actually just caused us to be even further apart and more socially awkward in face-to-face interactions.
[00:53:40.057 --> 00:53:45.360]  And of course, I don't know if you've noticed this little phenomenon on sites like Instagram, where every
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:48.241]  Chick on there looks exactly the same.
[00:53:48.681 --> 00:54:01.367]  It's this perception of beauty, and so now everyone has the same lips, and the same boob job, and the same hair color, and the same dresses, and everyone thinks it's pretty, and that's because it's total destruction of the individual.
[00:54:01.447 --> 00:54:07.490]  God wanted us all to be unique, and now we are all becoming androgynous robots.
[00:54:13.851 --> 00:54:30.803]  The architects of the New World Order are in a race to complete the structure of world government, so they can suppress the independent development of technologies that threaten their monopoly of power, while at the same time steering new developments in the direction the architects chart for humanity.
[00:54:34.865 --> 00:54:41.290]  The technocrats call their governing system the Final Revolution, because in the past, empires were enforced militarily.
[00:54:43.086 --> 00:54:57.591]  Now enforcement is primarily psychological and economic, and society itself is a construct of the elite, who operate outside the controlled paradigm, and control the civilization within, just as a child maintains the environment of a fish tank.
[00:54:58.191 --> 00:55:06.054]  We are like lab rats, living out our entire existence, never questioning the confines of the cage, or the scientists who experiment on us.
[00:55:08.325 --> 00:55:11.648]  New World Order engineers have hijacked human destiny.
[00:55:12.288 --> 00:55:22.217]  Its controllers have closely studied human behavior for more than a hundred years and are now steering us with expert control, using our primitive drives and desires as levers.
[00:55:22.857 --> 00:55:29.103]  They have developed their mind control system to the point of being able to control the average unconscious person like a car.
[00:55:42.586 --> 00:55:44.809]  Eugenics dominated the 20th century.
[00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:51.999]  Its ruthless spirit has now metastasized into the fields of genetics, nanotech, and robotics.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.661]  But that's not surprising.
[00:55:54.242 --> 00:55:58.949]  From their inception, all three disciplines have been dominated by eugenicists.
[00:56:01.152 --> 00:56:20.588]  The billionaire founder of Sun Microsystems, Bill Joy, courageously went public in 2000 to warn of a cancerous consensus among the technocratic elite that at best humanity would be completely enslaved by the year 2030, and at worst, mass extermination of everyone but the elite would take place.
[00:56:20.608 --> 00:56:29.456]  A who's who of the techno elite are members of what is known as the transhumanist or posthumanist movement.
[00:56:32.119 --> 00:56:44.387]  Many of its adherents see only the beneficial aspects of technology's exponential rise, like bringing sight to the blind, sound to the deaf, and longer life for all.
[00:56:47.789 --> 00:57:00.958]  But what many of them don't know is that master eugenicist Julian Huxley founded transhumanism, and that society's controllers openly admit that the new system is designed to progress into absolute tyranny.
[00:57:06.135 --> 00:57:17.705]  Leading transhumanist Ray Kurzweil boasts that technological advancements will allow those that can afford it to live forever, but admits that most won't be able to keep up with the new master race.
[00:57:20.968 --> 00:57:28.355]  The drive for world government is now all about who will control and have access to radical life extension systems.
[00:57:32.165 --> 00:57:35.607]  Biological evolution is too slow for the human species.
[00:57:36.087 --> 00:57:39.108]  Over the next few decades, it's going to be left in the dust.
[00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:47.113]  Transhumanists believe that they will attain the Fountain of Youth by merging with technology.
[00:57:47.613 --> 00:57:49.714]  Now, it may be within their reach.
[00:57:53.786 --> 00:58:00.799]  Decades ago, transhumanists said that if you did not accept augmentation or enhancements, you would no longer be able to get jobs.
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:02.782]  And now it's happening today.
[00:58:07.674 --> 00:58:12.516]  The elite who occupy the commanding heights of digital reality are suicidal nihilists.
[00:58:13.056 --> 00:58:21.459]  Suicidal nihilists know that there is no longer any substantive purpose to their willing, but they would always prefer to go on willing than not to act at all.
[00:58:21.879 --> 00:58:27.041]  They can very happily ally themselves with the notion of nuclear holocaust or perfect exterminism.
[00:58:28.755 --> 00:58:40.978]  Technology has become so powerful in its capacity for destruction that free humanity cannot afford to let psychopathic technocrats with delusions of grandeur repeat the mistakes of their forebears.
[00:58:41.438 --> 00:58:54.521]  Because it is highly probable that this time they may destroy everything, including themselves, in their mad rush for godhood.
[00:58:54.981 --> 00:58:55.941]  That's it for the show tonight.
[00:58:55.981 --> 00:58:57.622]  We'll see you tomorrow, 7 p.m.
