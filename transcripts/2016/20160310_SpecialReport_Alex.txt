[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.223]  Regarding executive orders, the Constitution states in Article 2, Section 3, Clause 5, that the executive, i.e.
[00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:18.045]  the President, take care that the laws be faithfully executed, or face impeachment.
[00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:22.387]  Specifically, an executive order must find support in the Constitution.
[00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:32.731]  Watering down the Second Amendment in order to confiscate the lawful right of a majority of Americans to protect themselves can hardly mean the laws are being faithfully executed.
[00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:38.515]  The conversation has to be based on facts and truth and what we're actually proposing.
[00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:15.420]  But from United States Senators, that expanding background checks will, not may, will lead to a registry, which will lead to confiscation, which will lead to a tyrannical government.
[00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:33.193]  Let's not forget that Gabrielle Giffords thankfully survived the 2011 Tucson shooting by the possibly MK Ultra victimized Jared Lee Loeffner, who erratically declared to the police while victims were still being treated, I just want you to know that I'm the only person that knew about this.
[00:01:33.653 --> 00:01:34.114]  Strange.
[00:01:34.554 --> 00:01:43.679]  Unfortunately, federal judge John Roll, a staunch blockade to Obama's future immigration invasion, was murdered, along with five others.
[00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:45.359]  Talk about a conspiracy.
[00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:46.420]  I'm sorry, Cooper.
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.061]  Yes, it is fair to call it a conspiracy.
[00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:48.941]  What are you saying?
[00:01:52.150 --> 00:02:02.514]  Are you suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot to take everybody's guns away so that we can impose martial law?
[00:02:02.534 --> 00:02:06.836]  And while you've been president, we are at the lowest murder rate in our country.
[00:02:07.196 --> 00:02:08.976]  All time low, the murders.
[00:02:09.417 --> 00:02:15.259]  We've been talking about Chicago, but downstate Illinois is closer to Kentucky, and everybody hunts down there.
[00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:17.880]  And so this is not alien territory to me.
[00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:20.124]  I grew up in Kentucky.
[00:02:20.425 --> 00:02:23.153]  Trust me, those guns aren't just for hunting.
[00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:26.823]  And secondly, Obama, you don't know a damn thing about Kentucky.
[00:02:27.011 --> 00:02:30.732]  Well, I've got bad news for all of you that scoff at the word impeachment.
[00:02:31.092 --> 00:02:39.134]  Once Obama leaves office, he will have set the table for global government to legally come in and feast on the American public.
[00:02:39.374 --> 00:02:42.395]  Obama trade, with its laws that bypass the U.S.
[00:02:42.435 --> 00:02:45.335]  Congress for the benefit of the banking corporate elite.
[00:02:45.695 --> 00:02:52.957]  Obamacare, a middle class destroying Stasi-esque data collection system masquerading as a healthcare system.
[00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:57.418]  Obamagration, flooding our cities with criminals and jihadists.
[00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:09.062]  And now Obamafiscation, a solitary push to reduce the threat posed by armed Americans as the final dish by the New World Order's puppet is presented to the table.
[00:03:09.242 --> 00:03:19.566]  By not impeaching Obama, our nationalist apathy will legally and necessarily aid and abet the death of the United States of America.
[00:03:20.026 --> 00:03:20.887]  The time is now.
[00:03:21.027 --> 00:03:26.211]  Call your representative at 202-224-3121.
[00:03:26.552 --> 00:03:28.353]  Operators are standing by.
[00:03:28.714 --> 00:03:38.402]  And if your representative needs more information, direct them to the NorthAmericanLawCenter.org's Articles of Impeachment of Barack Hussein Obama at the very top of their webpage.
[00:03:38.822 --> 00:03:40.724]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:03:49.508 --> 00:03:55.690]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential foreboding situation?
[00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.070]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.751]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:07.052]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:07.152 --> 00:04:13.034]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:04:13.214 --> 00:04:16.975]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:04:17.155 --> 00:04:20.036]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:04:20.056 --> 00:04:28.239]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:30.560]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.660]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:40.772]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
