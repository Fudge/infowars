[00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:51.760]  Welcome to the Infowars Sunday broadcast and today we're going to be joined by Alex Jones as well as by Roger Stone.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.181]  He'll be joining us in the second hour.
[00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:54.541]  We have a lot of breaking news.
[00:00:54.781 --> 00:01:06.725]  You've probably seen at this point the Patriot, I guess you could call him Gorilla Truther, getting behind the Fox News set and exposing the Bill Clinton rape t-shirt.
[00:01:07.665 --> 00:01:19.638]  Now this is something that Alex put out on Friday and in less than 24 hours we had somebody take him up on his offer and of course he put a lot of money into the kitty to pay people to get this message out.
[00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:28.107]  Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton are not about consensual sex that's happened with his so-called bimbos that she talked about.
[00:01:28.707 --> 00:01:31.610]  Now he had a lot of women on the side that it was consensual.
[00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:36.236]  But the real issue is the non-consensual things that Bill Clinton did.
[00:01:36.656 --> 00:01:41.501]  Attacking Juanita Broderick and Hillary Clinton attacking the women that Hillary had attacked.
[00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:43.739]  Doubling down after the fact.
[00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:46.360]  Cold-blooded attacks on these women.
[00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:48.682]  That's why we need to get this information out.
[00:01:48.722 --> 00:01:51.163]  And it was really funny if you look at this video.
[00:01:51.223 --> 00:01:54.485]  And if you haven't seen it, you can see it on Infowars.com.
[00:01:54.505 --> 00:01:58.707]  We have PatriotStorm's Fox set exposing Bill Clinton's sex crimes.
[00:01:59.068 --> 00:01:59.708]  We have that there.
[00:01:59.728 --> 00:02:01.049]  We also have the video.
[00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:01.989]  Very funny to see it.
[00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:04.831]  We've got Tucker Carlson turned around and saw it.
[00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:06.132]  He thought it was hilarious.
[00:02:06.532 --> 00:02:07.653]  I was rolling on the floor laughing.
[00:02:08.493 --> 00:02:09.794]  You'll enjoy this if you see it.
[00:02:10.154 --> 00:02:11.395]  And of course it's interesting also
[00:02:11.935 --> 00:02:16.560]  The person that is right next to Tucker Carlson, that's in the middle, is Abby Huntsman.
[00:02:17.141 --> 00:02:27.171]  And if you remember, she was the one who came on and said, after Alex Jones talked to Piers Morgan, they came back and they said, well, we should challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match.
[00:02:27.191 --> 00:02:28.172]  We're going to play that clip for you.
[00:02:28.192 --> 00:02:29.854]  And she said, yeah, I'd love to see him shot.
[00:02:30.134 --> 00:02:31.476]  Maybe by somebody in uniform.
[00:02:31.496 --> 00:02:31.816]  Ha ha.
[00:02:32.577 --> 00:02:37.741]  Of course, she is the daughter of a huntsman who ran for president, I think it was back in 2008.
[00:02:38.222 --> 00:02:40.103]  It was a very short blip on the screen.
[00:02:40.143 --> 00:02:41.825]  She was working for MSNBC at the time.
[00:02:42.665 --> 00:02:44.407]  Now she's working for Fox News.
[00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:45.327]  Very interesting.
[00:02:45.407 --> 00:02:46.829]  Alex is going to be breaking that down.
[00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:47.970]  This is the way we win, folks.
[00:02:49.042 --> 00:02:54.405]  You know, BLM, Black Lives Matter, is out there violently protesting people.
[00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:55.686]  This is a peaceful protest.
[00:02:56.146 --> 00:03:06.052]  This is done in places where we're told that the public is going to be invited to appear behind the guest hosts, and it's just simply exercising free speech peacefully.
[00:03:06.072 --> 00:03:07.693]  There's no trespass involved here.
[00:03:08.073 --> 00:03:13.376]  You know, you can do this lawfully and creatively, and that's what Alex is calling people to do.
[00:03:13.476 --> 00:03:15.497]  And of course, we're going to have him break that down when we come back.
[00:03:15.517 --> 00:03:18.239]  We're also going to be talking to Roger Stone,
[00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.945]  About the exclusive announcement that he put out today on Twitter, if you see it on the Hill.
[00:03:24.545 --> 00:03:30.772]  They talk about the fact that Roger Stone tweeted out that by Wednesday Hillary Clinton's campaign will be done.
[00:03:30.792 --> 00:03:33.015]  Hashtag WikiLeaks.
[00:03:33.976 --> 00:03:34.256]  I think so.
[00:03:50.422 --> 00:03:57.406]  Stoking fears of another 2008 financial crisis, as well as OPEC finally throwing in the price.
[00:03:57.426 --> 00:04:03.590]  You know, they just cannot get the economy going, even with incredibly cheap oil prices.
[00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.572]  And they tried a price war against domestic producers here in the United States.
[00:04:08.012 --> 00:04:13.956]  They've tried using their political surrogates like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to try to shut down all domestic energy production.
[00:04:14.536 --> 00:04:15.077]  Even still,
[00:04:15.757 --> 00:04:17.098]  They had to throw the towel in.
[00:04:17.118 --> 00:04:18.359]  That's a sign of two things.
[00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:32.446]  Resiliency of the American economy and it's also a sign of the fact that we have a very sick world economy that cannot respond to oil prices being low.
[00:04:32.827 --> 00:04:39.831]  Energy is one of the key issues in terms of getting our prosperity back as well as if you look at things like life expectancy.
[00:04:40.371 --> 00:04:42.052]  But as they went into this price war,
[00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.355]  And we saw the price get lower and lower.
[00:04:44.415 --> 00:04:48.842]  They still could not drive many American producers out of business.
[00:04:48.882 --> 00:04:49.903]  That's the interesting story.
[00:04:49.943 --> 00:04:54.070]  But when we come back, we're going to take a look at the economic news as well as this guerrilla marketing program.
[00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.193]  Alex Jones will be joining us right after the break.
[00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:56.593]  Stay tuned.
[00:05:09.867 --> 00:05:13.730]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:14.031 --> 00:05:21.297]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable grape-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:05:21.497 --> 00:05:32.466]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:05:32.946 --> 00:05:40.488]  In the history of InfoWars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:05:40.788 --> 00:05:44.508]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today.
[00:05:44.648 --> 00:05:54.611]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:05:54.851 --> 00:06:01.572]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:06:01.932 --> 00:06:03.054]  That means it's clean.
[00:06:03.395 --> 00:06:04.457]  That means it's pure.
[00:06:04.557 --> 00:06:07.281]  That's infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:06:07.462 --> 00:06:09.144]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:06:13.261 --> 00:06:15.943]  It's Sunday, October 2nd, 2016.
[00:06:16.924 --> 00:06:21.748]  We are now only 36 short days before the historic election.
[00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.332]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our maximum.
[00:06:27.673 --> 00:06:33.718]  That's what Donald Trump said back in Cleveland in July, and it has the new world order panicking today.
[00:06:33.738 --> 00:06:40.623]  You're listening to the undisputed number one voice globally against the new world
[00:06:41.917 --> 00:06:44.501]  This is the Alex Jones Show!
[00:06:55.576 --> 00:06:56.197]  Welcome back, everyone.
[00:06:56.337 --> 00:06:58.138]  I've been waiting for this segment all morning long.
[00:06:58.178 --> 00:07:03.863]  We are rolling out the red carpet, not for Tucker, but for some adorable, adoptable dogs.
[00:07:03.963 --> 00:07:10.528]  Every year, the Best Friends Animal Society helps cats and dogs who are stuck in animal shelters find us.
[00:07:10.648 --> 00:07:12.890]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.092]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[00:07:15.112 --> 00:07:18.294]  We've got a very exciting young man behind us.
[00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:19.676]  Not a Bill Clinton fan.
[00:07:20.703 --> 00:07:22.265]  He's a little bit upset, but that's okay.
[00:07:22.325 --> 00:07:22.946]  Everything is fine.
[00:07:23.006 --> 00:07:29.393]  In fact, some friends, because we are surrounded by dogs, and if there's anything that calms the human heart, it's a canine.
[00:07:29.413 --> 00:07:32.357]  That's the whole point of the segment, actually.
[00:07:32.377 --> 00:07:38.244]  They're with Best Friends, and joining us live is the co-founder of the Best Friends Animal Society, Francis...
[00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:40.725]  The establishment is now in total panic.
[00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:46.970]  And if citizens take action, we can bring down the controlled media facade once and for all.
[00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:52.433]  Citizen action on the street, in the information war, can win this election.
[00:07:52.874 --> 00:08:02.180]  The United States can then link up with the United Kingdom, Russia, and other countries that are leaving the global government and re-establishing national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:08:03.877 --> 00:08:05.738]  I'm very upset with the mainstream media.
[00:08:05.798 --> 00:08:07.660]  We've seen incredible deception from them.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.624]  We saw Lester Holt be the third person in the debate last Monday night.
[00:08:14.364 --> 00:08:24.471]  And they've now had to admit at the debate commission that indeed the crowd couldn't hear Donald Trump when he was talking, but Hillary was hooked into the sound system, and they were fading his mic up and down.
[00:08:25.151 --> 00:08:26.212]  I noticed it live on air.
[00:08:27.053 --> 00:08:30.255]  They said he was a conspiracy theorist, now they admit it's actually true.
[00:08:31.482 --> 00:08:35.485]  He will debate coming up next at CNN.
[00:08:35.905 --> 00:08:40.308]  And Anderson Cooper, admitted CIA agent, will be the quote moderator.
[00:08:40.769 --> 00:08:42.530]  Give me a break, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:43.351]  This is out of control.
[00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:48.134]  And now the mainstream media is covering up Bill Clinton's true crimes.
[00:08:48.935 --> 00:08:52.197]  The fact that Bill Clinton has settled sexual assault cases before.
[00:08:52.898 --> 00:08:55.019]  I have interviewed the women that he has raped.
[00:08:55.499 --> 00:08:58.422]  There have been nurses and witnesses to it happening.
[00:08:59.369 --> 00:09:03.151]  That rush into the hotel rooms minutes after it happens and the women are bleeding?
[00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:05.391]  This is well known.
[00:09:05.531 --> 00:09:06.572]  This is what they do.
[00:09:06.772 --> 00:09:09.113]  And Hillary Clinton has always covered up for him.
[00:09:09.173 --> 00:09:11.494]  That's been her job.
[00:09:11.514 --> 00:09:14.535]  A lot of men who are gay have a fake wife called a beard.
[00:09:15.095 --> 00:09:16.576]  Now, Bill Clinton's not gay, but
[00:09:17.176 --> 00:09:21.399]  Hillary Clinton is his beard for the fact that he is a sexual assaulter and a predator.
[00:09:21.699 --> 00:09:31.585]  But look at him attacking innocent countries, bombing Belgrade, bombing aspirin factories in Sudan, killing a half million Iraqi children with increased sanctions, worse than what the Bushes did.
[00:09:32.005 --> 00:09:33.827]  They are a crime syndicate.
[00:09:34.747 --> 00:09:37.249]  They represent the old order with the Bushes as well.
[00:09:38.149 --> 00:09:41.511]  And that's why on Friday's show I thought, you know,
[00:09:42.876 --> 00:09:50.079]  They will fire anybody off Fox, CNN, MSNBC, or Bantam that talks about Bill Clinton and sexual assault.
[00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:50.999]  It's a fact.
[00:09:51.059 --> 00:09:51.679]  It's come out in the news.
[00:09:52.499 --> 00:09:59.742]  And I said, we're selling the shirt that Roger Stone designed that says Bill Clinton is a rapist, basically, Bill Clinton and the word rape, to try to get the word out.
[00:10:00.442 --> 00:10:01.883]  Why not have a bounty?
[00:10:02.663 --> 00:10:10.904]  Of $1,000 for anybody that can get up on national TV and not break any laws for five seconds with the shirt clearly visible saying rape.
[00:10:11.365 --> 00:10:19.206]  And $5,000 if you can get the audio out that you're concerned about his sexual assaults or it should be investigated or if you believe he's a rapist that he's a rapist.
[00:10:19.246 --> 00:10:20.886]  And the evidence shows that there's a cover-up.
[00:10:21.086 --> 00:10:22.506]  This guy's far worse than Bill Cosby.
[00:10:22.526 --> 00:10:24.467]  And I'm not going to sit here and watch this double standard.
[00:10:25.227 --> 00:10:29.528]  Within less than 24 hours, Saturday morning, some gentleman, we don't know his name yet, but he's going to win $5,000.
[00:10:29.568 --> 00:10:30.928]  You know, email us, sir.
[00:10:32.717 --> 00:10:37.640]  Got up, got the rape shirt on TV for five seconds, and then brought up the sexual assaults.
[00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:41.703]  Now, I'm still going to pay the $5,000, but anybody else does this, you're not going to get it.
[00:10:42.384 --> 00:10:45.786]  Use a bullhorn, or use your voice, but don't go over the barricade.
[00:10:45.806 --> 00:10:55.293]  I know they're out on the street, you're not invading their studio, but still, trying to climb over the barricade, once they try to stop you, I understand, you kind of use it to hold on, still is not right.
[00:10:55.553 --> 00:10:57.474]  So, you have to follow laws.
[00:10:58.195 --> 00:10:59.816]  They get crowds out there all the time.
[00:11:00.436 --> 00:11:00.956]  All the time.
[00:11:01.436 --> 00:11:03.717]  Waving their signs, their Hillary, their Trump signs, whatever.
[00:11:04.417 --> 00:11:05.238]  They're out there doing it.
[00:11:05.258 --> 00:11:06.118]  They're asking for it.
[00:11:06.438 --> 00:11:07.078]  Go out there.
[00:11:07.318 --> 00:11:08.299]  Follow local laws.
[00:11:09.119 --> 00:11:09.779]  Wear the shirt.
[00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:11.900]  Get the shirt at Infowars.com.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.800]  That'll help pay for all the bounties we're going to pay.
[00:11:14.201 --> 00:11:16.241]  Get the Hillary for Prison shirt at Infowars.com as well.
[00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:25.164]  But regardless of what you do, go to Infowars.com and print off the big PDFs we have of it and post those up around your town as well to create local news stories.
[00:11:25.764 --> 00:11:26.945]  And this is about the people
[00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.111]  Overriding the censorship and control that's in MSM.
[00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:32.192]  It's a lot bigger than the Clintons.
[00:11:32.232 --> 00:11:33.092]  It's a lot bigger than Trump.
[00:11:33.312 --> 00:11:34.793]  It's bigger than Alex Jones or M4 Wars.
[00:11:35.313 --> 00:11:36.954]  It's about the people taking action.
[00:11:37.294 --> 00:11:39.935]  The French Resistance did things similar to this with the V symbol.
[00:11:40.395 --> 00:11:45.557]  We've had contests before that had hundreds of newspapers covering it and dozens of TV stations.
[00:11:45.957 --> 00:11:48.398]  So we're going to also have a contest I announce later in the week as well.
[00:11:48.838 --> 00:12:00.362]  Dealing with posting posters exposing the Clintons of different types, not just rape, Benghazi, you name it, and then videotaping it, putting it on YouTube, and then whoever gets the most coverage is going to get a big prize as well.
[00:12:00.702 --> 00:12:10.585]  We're going to put the rules up by Monday for both these contests, but some people say, well, what happens if a bunch of people go out and say rape on TV?
[00:12:10.945 --> 00:12:12.985]  It'll create a giant tsunami.
[00:12:13.005 --> 00:12:17.807]  That's what we want, and we'll turn it into a big national story, just like Hillary for President, but even bigger.
[00:12:18.809 --> 00:12:20.671]  And listen, we're risking losing the country.
[00:12:20.771 --> 00:12:22.473]  Desperate times mean desperate measures.
[00:12:22.933 --> 00:12:30.701]  So I need all of you to take action, all of you to think about ways to do this, especially if you're in L.A., New York, D.C., or other areas where national news is going to be taking place.
[00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:33.684]  And there's other creative ways to also get this out there.
[00:12:33.724 --> 00:12:39.589]  Just do it legally, and do it lawfully, and check your local laws, and you will win the prize.
[00:12:39.609 --> 00:12:39.669]  $1,000 or $5,000.
[00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:40.230]  Now, there's a $100,000 cap.
[00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:40.730]  That's our budget.
[00:12:43.908 --> 00:12:49.476]  We think that this promotion will probably, you know, sell maybe that much t-shirts, but it doesn't matter.
[00:12:49.576 --> 00:12:58.568]  I just want to try to get this out because I have daughters, I love women, and I'm sick and tired of watching these people claim that they represent women when they're such predators over women and they're so horrible.
[00:12:59.048 --> 00:13:01.630]  So, InfoWars.com will have all this information posted.
[00:13:02.331 --> 00:13:04.052]  And we want to salute the young man that did this.
[00:13:04.232 --> 00:13:08.476]  And I also want to point out the New York Times has called us asking if Tucker Carlson rigged this with us.
[00:13:08.896 --> 00:13:10.357]  Tucker Carlson had nothing to do with this.
[00:13:10.477 --> 00:13:11.718]  I announced this yesterday on the air.
[00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:16.963]  And whoever this young man is went and did this because it was one of the first live shows on the street.
[00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:18.043]  That's what happened.
[00:13:18.064 --> 00:13:22.287]  But they're already looking for someone so they can burn Tucker Carlson and get him kicked off Fox.
[00:13:22.567 --> 00:13:25.229]  Because there's already been a coup at Fox with the whole Roger Ailes thing.
[00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.111]  And now they're trying to take over the rest of the media.
[00:13:27.391 --> 00:13:28.192]  It's really happening.
[00:13:28.732 --> 00:13:31.315]  I mean, as of today, the UN has got authority over the web.
[00:13:31.655 --> 00:13:34.818]  And so, a really dark time of oppression is unfolding.
[00:13:34.838 --> 00:13:38.622]  It's time for us, on the ground, to get the word out, not just on the internet.
[00:13:39.323 --> 00:13:40.845]  I'm Alex Jones, signing off for InfoWars.com.
[00:13:40.925 --> 00:13:45.209]  I want to salute you all out there that are fighting for liberty, the true liberals, the true constitutionalists.
[00:13:45.529 --> 00:13:47.712]  If you're watching or listening to this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.171]  And again, you can see that article at Infowars.com.
[00:13:52.211 --> 00:13:59.836]  PatriotStormsFox said, exposing Bill Clinton's sex crimes, and as Alex was pointing out, they're trying to attack Tucker Carlson over that.
[00:13:59.856 --> 00:14:01.076]  He saw some humor in that.
[00:14:01.797 --> 00:14:05.579]  You know, the way this breaks down is, take a look at the way the Daily Mail reported this.
[00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:13.023]  Headline, man shouts, Bill Clinton is a rapist on live TV to win $5,000 from 9-11 conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:14:13.083 --> 00:14:16.725]  And this writer, Jennifer Smith, for the Daily Mail, goes on to say,
[00:14:17.085 --> 00:14:20.608]  Well it's not clear whether Jones has lived up to his promise to give the man the money.
[00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:22.370]  Understand the timeline on this thing.
[00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.674]  Alex announced the contest on Friday afternoon.
[00:14:27.475 --> 00:14:32.820]  Saturday morning this guy does this and within a couple of hours it's not clear if Alex Jones has paid this guy yet or not.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.261]  I don't know that Alex even knows the guy's name yet.
[00:14:35.521 --> 00:14:36.442]  I mean, we put it up there.
[00:14:36.562 --> 00:14:37.723]  Alex is good for it, folks.
[00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:40.764]  He's paid off on all of these contests in the past.
[00:14:41.065 --> 00:14:43.146]  It's just the way they smear people.
[00:14:43.706 --> 00:14:47.668]  But understand, when we say that Bill Clinton is a rapist, we're not smearing Bill Clinton.
[00:14:48.089 --> 00:14:48.969]  We're telling the truth.
[00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:56.133]  And we're telling the truth about Hillary Clinton, that she threw these women that Bill Clinton raped and sexually abused.
[00:14:56.153 --> 00:14:57.154]  This is not consensual.
[00:14:57.774 --> 00:14:59.015]  We have to understand the difference.
[00:14:59.035 --> 00:15:07.742]  He's got a long string of consensual bimbos, but he also has a long string of sexual victims behind him as well.
[00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:08.603]  That's what we're talking about.
[00:15:08.623 --> 00:15:12.145]  People like Juanita Broderick, people like Kathleen Willey.
[00:15:12.826 --> 00:15:16.789]  And when you look at the people that are there, of course, I thought it was interesting that Abby Huntsman was there.
[00:15:17.129 --> 00:15:20.992]  Remember this clip from a couple of years ago when Alex Jones went on with Piers Morgan?
[00:15:21.012 --> 00:15:21.653]  Let's play that clip.
[00:15:26.288 --> 00:15:33.830]  I don't care what the justification is that you're allowed in this country to own a semi-automatic weapon, much less a handgun.
[00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:37.131]  But what do you need a semi-automatic weapon for?
[00:15:37.151 --> 00:15:41.993]  The only reason I think you need it is, Pierce, challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match.
[00:15:42.013 --> 00:15:45.574]  Show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally and pop him.
[00:15:45.814 --> 00:15:46.474]  I'd love to see that.
[00:15:46.674 --> 00:15:47.375]  In uniform.
[00:15:47.415 --> 00:15:49.355]  There you go.
[00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:50.516]  Okay, she went from MSNBC.
[00:15:51.776 --> 00:15:55.979]  She goes from MSNBC to Fox News as part of the re-makeover of Fox News.
[00:15:55.999 --> 00:16:02.082]  And of course, she's the daughter of John Huntsman, the guy who was a tiny blip on the screen in the 2008 presidential elections.
[00:16:02.362 --> 00:16:02.743]  Stay with us.
[00:16:02.763 --> 00:16:07.445]  When we come back, we're going to talk about the tax issue that has bubbled up this weekend with Donald Trump.
[00:16:18.432 --> 00:16:19.853]  Hillary Clinton is desperate.
[00:16:20.802 --> 00:16:28.750]  Donald Trump was 10 points ahead in the polls until Reuters and others began sampling 10 to 15 percent more Democrats in their polls to skew the numbers.
[00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:29.611]  It's incredible.
[00:16:29.891 --> 00:16:39.080]  But despite all that skewing in the last two weeks, now in major polls, put up with the very same groups, with the same methodology, Trump is neck and neck with her, or even a point or two ahead.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:45.025]  But if you go look at the social media, and Breitbart and Gateway Pundit have done this, it's incredible.
[00:16:45.726 --> 00:16:55.048]  We're talking three, four, five, six times the support at places like Facebook, Livestream, Reddit, and so many other places.
[00:16:55.288 --> 00:16:59.169]  In fact, sometimes he's got ten times more likes and ten times more views.
[00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:03.591]  That's what we saw with Bernie Sanders, where he'd have 20,000 people, Hillary'd have 500.
[00:17:04.391 --> 00:17:13.013]  We did exit polls in California and other so-called battleground states in the Democratic primary, and we talked to eight people before we found one or two Hillary supporters.
[00:17:13.593 --> 00:17:16.816]  That's why Hillary was forced to steal it with the superdelegates.
[00:17:17.476 --> 00:17:19.077]  Let's look at some of the numbers themselves.
[00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:24.882]  Trump had 10 million plus likes to Clinton's 5 million on Facebook.
[00:17:25.242 --> 00:17:33.068]  And that's with Facebook admittedly censoring Trump pages everywhere they can and even meeting with Hillary Clinton just like Google does.
[00:17:34.013 --> 00:17:41.860]  Trump averages 30,000 live viewers per stream, and Clinton averages 500 live stream viewers per stream.
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:46.684]  On Reddit, Trump averages 197,000 plus subscribers, Hillary 24,000.
[00:17:47.164 --> 00:17:51.608]  Hillary for prison has 55,000 subscribers.
[00:17:51.888 --> 00:17:53.169]  Gee, wonder who started that.
[00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:57.753]  And this is only a snapshot of the numbers we're seeing with Trump.
[00:17:58.193 --> 00:18:01.716]  You go to YouTube, his average video has millions of views.
[00:18:02.777 --> 00:18:05.178]  You go look at Hillary's official campaign site.
[00:18:05.718 --> 00:18:07.658]  Most of her videos have 2,000 or 3,000 views.
[00:18:07.698 --> 00:18:09.159]  Her bigger one's a few hundred thousand.
[00:18:09.499 --> 00:18:10.659]  This lady's a joke.
[00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:12.380]  She's not liked by her own party.
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:19.362]  But we're being told it's going to be a landslide for her because they're trying to get us ready for election fraud.
[00:18:19.742 --> 00:18:22.843]  Something so well documented in this country's past.
[00:18:24.073 --> 00:18:28.375]  But Obama says it's preposterous he doesn't even know what that is.
[00:18:29.176 --> 00:18:31.157]  Well, President Obama, we do know what it is.
[00:18:31.937 --> 00:18:37.820]  And this time, we don't have somebody like Mitt Romney or John McCain who's going to stand down and not take action.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.301]  We don't have somebody who's going to throw in the towel if there's fraud.
[00:18:40.562 --> 00:18:44.804]  We've got Donald Trump and an awake population that's aware of your scams.
[00:18:45.885 --> 00:18:47.546]  The social engineers have jumped the shark.
[00:18:47.966 --> 00:18:49.966]  They are stealing this election in front of everyone.
[00:18:50.867 --> 00:18:54.668]  By forcing them to engage in fraud, we are exposing them forever.
[00:18:55.008 --> 00:19:10.333]  So even if Donald Trump loses, even if that happens due to fraud or scandals, it doesn't matter because we've been in the arena, we've politically exposed the system, political correctness, globalism, the maxim has been introduced, Americanism, not globalism.
[00:19:11.172 --> 00:19:13.233]  This is a good time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:13.613 --> 00:19:19.674]  And we owe Donald Trump so much for being willing to put his family, his life, his treasure on the line.
[00:19:20.074 --> 00:19:21.315]  He is the man in the arena.
[00:19:21.915 --> 00:19:23.675]  And I'm honored to be in that arena with him as well.
[00:19:24.155 --> 00:19:28.717]  If you haven't joined us in this historic fight, it's time to pick a side right now.
[00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:40.951]  The talk show host is Alex Jones.
[00:19:41.011 --> 00:19:42.891]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[00:19:42.951 --> 00:19:45.692]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[00:19:45.892 --> 00:19:46.712]  Alex Jones.
[00:19:46.792 --> 00:19:49.553]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:19:49.613 --> 00:19:52.814]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:19:52.834 --> 00:19:54.155]  Deeply, I think, racist.
[00:19:54.255 --> 00:19:56.115]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[00:19:56.215 --> 00:19:58.016]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[00:19:58.036 --> 00:20:02.117]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:20:02.137 --> 00:20:03.277]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:03.357 --> 00:20:08.259]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:20:13.402 --> 00:20:16.025]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:30.001 --> 00:20:32.883]  I'm Dave Knight here on Sunday, October 2nd, 2016.
[00:20:33.003 --> 00:20:38.245]  It's the Alex Jones Show, and as you hear Tower of Power saying, taxed to the max.
[00:20:38.265 --> 00:20:39.626]  Yeah, we're all taxed to the max, aren't we?
[00:20:40.367 --> 00:20:47.090]  Part of this distraction, and it is a distraction to talk about Donald Trump's tax returns, and I'll tell you why they're using this as a distraction.
[00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:51.913]  Folks, they want you to think about his tax returns and not your tax returns.
[00:20:53.052 --> 00:21:01.240]  Hillary Clinton has put out her tax plans, and it doesn't matter what income level you're in, from the very poorest to the very richest, your taxes are going to go up.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.525]  I'm going to break that down for a couple of the middle income tax brackets.
[00:21:06.165 --> 00:21:10.590]  But they want you to just be jealous about Donald Trump's taxes.
[00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:12.291]  You know what they're selling is not hope.
[00:21:12.972 --> 00:21:14.673]  They're selling envy, okay?
[00:21:14.793 --> 00:21:15.974]  Or maybe they're selling rape.
[00:21:16.294 --> 00:21:20.616]  Rape of the economy, just like Bill Clinton has raped so many women.
[00:21:23.277 --> 00:21:32.742]  We also have, coming up in the next segment, we're going to have Alex Jones breaking down a leak from Hillary Clinton.
[00:21:33.732 --> 00:21:37.935]  Throwing millennials under the bus, saying they're the children of the Great Recession.
[00:21:38.375 --> 00:21:41.337]  She talked about them as basement dwellers, as baristas, okay?
[00:21:41.377 --> 00:21:45.600]  That's what she thinks of these people who are Bernie Sanders supporters.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.620]  And I thought it was interesting.
[00:21:47.101 --> 00:21:49.062]  She says, well, you know, I think we can get free college.
[00:21:49.082 --> 00:21:50.383]  They think they can get free health care.
[00:21:50.403 --> 00:21:52.104]  You know, why would they think they can get those things?
[00:21:52.824 --> 00:21:57.047]  It's because the Democrats have been lying to them, promising them free college.
[00:21:57.187 --> 00:21:59.809]  She's been promising free health care for the last 25 years.
[00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:10.342]  It was Hillary Clinton, as first lady, that pretended that she had some authority to take over, what was it, about a seventh of the economy, the medical industry.
[00:22:10.702 --> 00:22:11.423]  Now they're doing it!
[00:22:11.463 --> 00:22:12.104]  They're on their way!
[00:22:12.892 --> 00:22:15.054]  They've got a gradual program that they're bringing in here.
[00:22:15.095 --> 00:22:15.835]  They slapped her down.
[00:22:15.855 --> 00:22:18.899]  They said, you know, you tried to go too fast on this.
[00:22:18.919 --> 00:22:20.621]  We've got to take a more gradual approach.
[00:22:20.641 --> 00:22:21.702]  And that's what they're doing right now.
[00:22:21.762 --> 00:22:23.003]  But make no mistake about it.
[00:22:23.464 --> 00:22:28.750]  They're trying to take over our full economy here, starting with our health care.
[00:22:29.331 --> 00:22:33.535]  But she goes on to say, I'm occupying from the center left to the center right.
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:40.304]  You know, I think it's very important that we understand that it isn't simply a left-right political paradigm.
[00:22:40.864 --> 00:22:42.385]  See if you can find a picture of a thing.
[00:22:42.405 --> 00:22:43.926]  Look for a Nolan chart.
[00:22:44.246 --> 00:22:45.427]  N-O-L-A-N.
[00:22:45.467 --> 00:22:46.528]  Pull up the Nolan chart.
[00:22:47.088 --> 00:22:50.371]  This is something that one of the founders of the Libertarian Party came up with a few years ago.
[00:22:50.471 --> 00:23:03.059]  What it does is it asks some questions, or you look at the positions of some particular politician, and you map them on an axis, with one axis, vertical axis, being economic freedom, the other one being personal freedom.
[00:23:03.459 --> 00:23:06.722]  Then you take that axis, and if you rotate it 45 degrees, you get a diamond.
[00:23:06.782 --> 00:23:09.504]  And if you're looking at the broadcast right now, you see that diamond.
[00:23:10.265 --> 00:23:14.609]  And you can break that down, you'll see people who are on the left liberal and on the right liberal, okay?
[00:23:14.629 --> 00:23:25.138]  But what do you do with somebody that's like... We got like Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, and we're told, well, one of them is an extreme leftist, the other is an extreme rightist.
[00:23:25.638 --> 00:23:31.539]  Where do authoritarians go on this simple line that they always tell you about the political spectrum?
[00:23:31.799 --> 00:23:32.019]  Okay?
[00:23:32.059 --> 00:23:33.440]  It is not simply a line.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.040]  You need at least two dimensions to see what's going on.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.841]  No, Stalin and Hitler would both be down there in the authoritarian bloc.
[00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:40.841]  And you know what?
[00:23:40.941 --> 00:23:42.102]  So would Hillary Clinton.
[00:23:42.642 --> 00:23:43.782]  She's not centrist at all.
[00:23:44.242 --> 00:23:45.622]  She's bottomist, okay?
[00:23:45.742 --> 00:23:46.583]  She's authoritarian.
[00:23:46.603 --> 00:23:48.263]  If you look at that chart, she's down at the bottom.
[00:23:48.823 --> 00:24:01.048]  So you can have people that are on the left, people on the right, they give you some political, personal freedom, or they give you some economic freedom, but the people who want to take all your freedom are down at the bottom when you rotate that chart, and it makes a lot of sense when you look at that.
[00:24:01.068 --> 00:24:06.490]  You know, Ronald Reagan talked about, are we going, not left or right, but up or down?
[00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:12.332]  Okay, you want to go up towards freedom, or do you want to go down towards government control, central government control?
[00:24:12.612 --> 00:24:15.273]  Alex is going to be talking about that coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:15.613 --> 00:24:17.134]  In this segment, the time that we got left,
[00:24:17.734 --> 00:24:33.619]  I want to talk about taxes because they are crowing about the fact the New York Times went in and illegally got these documents about Donald Trump's taxes and said, look at this, we don't think that he has paid any taxes in the last 20 years because he had nearly a billion dollar loss in 1995.
[00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:34.439]  Where does that come from?
[00:24:34.499 --> 00:24:36.019]  Where are they making these assumptions?
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.760]  CNN has a former tax accountant.
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:44.662]  He says it's wrong to assume that Trump's nearly billion dollar loss came from his own money.
[00:24:45.615 --> 00:24:48.440]  And this is Edward McCaffery, okay?
[00:24:49.361 --> 00:24:51.504]  And he is a former tax person.
[00:24:51.665 --> 00:24:53.648]  He knows what he's talking about, folks.
[00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:59.197]  Listen, I want to give you two examples in terms of your home mortgage.
[00:25:00.626 --> 00:25:04.790]  They say it's awful that Donald Trump took tax deductions that he's entitled to.
[00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:09.174]  They don't want you to understand the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion.
[00:25:09.914 --> 00:25:13.497]  Tax avoidance is saying I'm going to take the deductions that I'm allowed to take.
[00:25:13.557 --> 00:25:19.523]  Tax evasion says I'm just going to ignore the tax system or I'm going to lie on the form or whatever.
[00:25:21.144 --> 00:25:22.645]  Avoidance is not cheating.
[00:25:23.066 --> 00:25:26.849]  Any more than it's cheating to take your home mortgage deduction if you have that.
[00:25:27.069 --> 00:25:32.754]  Or to deduct medical expenses if you get over the massive threshold that they put on the tax form.
[00:25:33.695 --> 00:25:33.935]  Okay?
[00:25:34.015 --> 00:25:39.259]  If you take your home mortgage deduction, that is simply tax avoidance.
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.081]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:25:42.079 --> 00:25:49.724]  If you're going to get into the system, if you're going to fill out all the forms, doing it that way, there is nothing wrong with that.
[00:25:50.005 --> 00:25:58.170]  And when you look at the situation that you've got going with Donald Trump, it is not wrong for him to use the legal tax deductions that are available to him.
[00:25:59.251 --> 00:26:00.972]  Now, another example.
[00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:04.395]  I had a friend when I was working back in North Carolina.
[00:26:05.339 --> 00:26:10.462]  He was building a home and he went to a home builder and he gave him a lot of money as a down payment to build this custom home for him.
[00:26:10.602 --> 00:26:14.845]  And the guy, like a lot of builders, got overextended on his debt payments.
[00:26:15.505 --> 00:26:16.566]  And the guy went bankrupt.
[00:26:16.746 --> 00:26:20.248]  He had absolutely, he lost all that money and a lot of money from other people as well.
[00:26:20.888 --> 00:26:23.230]  So my friend took him to court, sued him, and won.
[00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:24.951]  But the guy didn't have any money.
[00:26:25.731 --> 00:26:29.153]  And so what he got was a judgment for X amount of dollars for his loss.
[00:26:30.394 --> 00:26:33.316]  And he could take that a little bit at a time
[00:26:34.298 --> 00:26:35.118]  For 20 years.
[00:26:35.899 --> 00:26:37.700]  And then you lose whatever you haven't claimed.
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.380]  And for him, he didn't have that much money.
[00:26:39.901 --> 00:26:41.401]  He probably wasn't going to get it back.
[00:26:41.541 --> 00:26:45.003]  Even taking it as a credit against his taxes.
[00:26:45.503 --> 00:26:48.305]  Using it as a deduction every year for up to 20 years.
[00:26:48.325 --> 00:26:50.386]  And that's what we're talking about with Donald Trump.
[00:26:50.746 --> 00:26:51.786]  It could be something like that.
[00:26:51.826 --> 00:26:53.067]  A massive loss that he had.
[00:26:53.227 --> 00:26:55.388]  Or it could be somebody that defrauded him.
[00:26:56.184 --> 00:27:01.808]  Or somebody that he sued and won, got that judgment against him and had to take that over a 20-year period.
[00:27:02.609 --> 00:27:04.751]  That is something that happens to ordinary people all the time.
[00:27:04.791 --> 00:27:13.738]  Just like taking your mortgage deduction if somebody defrauds you, and I don't know what the basis of this is, and we won't know if we don't see his tax returns.
[00:27:14.318 --> 00:27:20.103]  But understand that if you're looking for the tax returns, they're not trying to get greater transparency.
[00:27:20.543 --> 00:27:25.887]  What the Clinton camp is trying to do is muddy the water in endless complexities.
[00:27:26.608 --> 00:27:42.561]  And we've talked about this before, how Money Magazine used to, for the longest time, I don't know if Money Magazine is even around anymore, but I know back in the 1990s, they would get 30 to 50 tax accountants, and they would look at a tax return for a family, not a business even, not even a small business, but just a family.
[00:27:43.101 --> 00:27:44.322]  That had some events.
[00:27:44.582 --> 00:27:52.830]  Maybe they had some inheritance taxes, or they sold some stocks, or they sold a couple of home, they sold a home, or vacation home, a second home, or something like that.
[00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:54.571]  Some unusual events.
[00:27:54.752 --> 00:27:59.236]  And it was a family that had maybe $120,000 income or something.
[00:27:59.276 --> 00:28:02.999]  So they had a good deal of income, and they had a couple of unusual events.
[00:28:03.019 --> 00:28:05.942]  And they would give this to 30 to 50 tax accountants.
[00:28:06.002 --> 00:28:06.963]  And guess what they would get?
[00:28:07.903 --> 00:28:09.345]  30 to 50 different answers.
[00:28:09.845 --> 00:28:18.354]  And the answers can range anywhere from $10,000 or $15,000 in taxes owed to $10,000 to $15,000 worth of taxes that came back.
[00:28:19.075 --> 00:28:21.137]  See, that's the way the tax code is set up.
[00:28:21.678 --> 00:28:22.198]  On purpose.
[00:28:23.359 --> 00:28:27.504]  A law that is sufficiently complex is the same as having no law at all.
[00:28:28.658 --> 00:28:30.479]  And it can be used as a weapon.
[00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:32.260]  It can be used as a weapon against you.
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.042]  It can be used as a weapon against political candidates.
[00:28:35.302 --> 00:28:39.645]  It can be used as a weapon, as we've seen in the Obama administration, against political opponents.
[00:28:40.305 --> 00:28:42.847]  Using the IRS to audit people that they don't like.
[00:28:43.587 --> 00:28:48.611]  Coming after them and even turning over their information to political opponents.
[00:28:49.571 --> 00:28:54.954]  And when all of this is going on, understand the New York Times paid absolutely no taxes in 2014.
[00:28:55.134 --> 00:28:58.296]  They did the same thing they're haranguing Donald Trump for.
[00:28:58.596 --> 00:28:58.957]  Stay with us.
[00:28:58.977 --> 00:29:04.480]  When we come back, Alex Jones is going to break down Clinton, throwing the Bernie Sanders supporters under the bus.
[00:29:11.224 --> 00:29:16.327]  The future is bleak if we, as a nation, don't change something.
[00:29:25.543 --> 00:29:26.804]  There's a reason why we do this.
[00:29:27.564 --> 00:29:29.425]  You know, you've had shootings that are questionable.
[00:29:29.485 --> 00:29:32.407]  You have, you know, riots in Milwaukee.
[00:29:32.447 --> 00:29:35.149]  You have people losing their mind in Louisiana.
[00:29:35.409 --> 00:29:42.373]  While I believe law enforcement and police officers are always trying to do the right thing, oftentimes they're missing the trick.
[00:29:43.174 --> 00:29:47.757]  The more training we have, the more experience we have, the more self-aware we are.
[00:29:51.519 --> 00:29:52.600]  The better shape you're in,
[00:29:53.462 --> 00:29:57.084]  The longer you can do this, the better shape you're in, the more observant you're going to be.
[00:29:57.184 --> 00:29:59.565]  The better shape you're in, the more aware you're going to be.
[00:30:00.185 --> 00:30:04.527]  The better shape you're in, the quicker you're going to be able to assess and then go to action.
[00:30:07.529 --> 00:30:09.190]  They need to be on the range.
[00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:10.330]  They need to be in the gyms.
[00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:12.411]  They need to be in martial arts studios.
[00:30:12.451 --> 00:30:16.533]  They need to be given the skills that can ultimately be able to save lives.
[00:30:16.993 --> 00:30:17.674]  They're there to serve.
[00:30:17.694 --> 00:30:19.074]  They're there to protect the public.
[00:30:19.575 --> 00:30:21.516]  And right now there's this perception that
[00:30:22.634 --> 00:30:23.494]  They can't do that.
[00:30:23.774 --> 00:30:42.701]  Whether that's from maybe a systemic problem within the departments themselves, or the greater problem is that the bureaucracy and how police departments are organized are preventing them from getting the training that they need.
[00:30:42.761 --> 00:30:43.801]  Welcome to Sheepdog Response.
[00:30:43.821 --> 00:30:46.062]  You know, yesterday we worked like 16 hours.
[00:30:47.558 --> 00:30:57.463]  We're in the gym fighting, grappling, working on cuffing, striking, takedowns, all with the intent of being able to protect people.
[00:30:57.503 --> 00:31:02.286]  We're not showing people these skills so they can go and hurt other people.
[00:31:02.306 --> 00:31:03.606]  That's not what's happening here.
[00:31:03.626 --> 00:31:07.408]  We're giving them skills so they can go protect people, so they can go save lives.
[00:31:08.869 --> 00:31:13.591]  Time after time, the more training you have, the more experience you have, the better decisions you're going to make.
[00:31:14.492 --> 00:31:16.833]  If you're in a position where you're in a fight for your life,
[00:31:18.117 --> 00:31:20.379]  Just because you can kill somebody doesn't mean you need to.
[00:31:21.259 --> 00:31:25.482]  You may not need to if you have the training, if you have the experience.
[00:31:26.603 --> 00:31:38.691]  If you're going to put your life on the line, if you're going to step up and say, I'm here to serve the public, I'm here, I'm committed to provide safety to a group of people, you can't do that alone, and you can't do that, the average person can't do that.
[00:31:38.831 --> 00:31:44.315]  You have to have a very specific skill set and training to be able to, one, provide it at a
[00:31:45.447 --> 00:31:49.290]  And in a safe way, not only for yourself, but also for the public.
[00:31:50.271 --> 00:31:53.754]  And there's only a handful of people that understand and recognize what those skills are.
[00:31:53.774 --> 00:32:00.840]  And I'm going to pour my life and my heart into making sure that I can give these skills to the guys that need it.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:05.103]  And the guys wearing blue, you know, that's those guys.
[00:32:05.123 --> 00:32:11.208]  I'm going to lay it out short and sweet.
[00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:18.653]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[00:32:19.374 --> 00:32:23.256]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[00:32:24.224 --> 00:32:26.466]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[00:32:26.526 --> 00:32:27.687]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[00:32:28.367 --> 00:32:30.949]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:32.230]  Or more.
[00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:34.091]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:32:34.772 --> 00:32:36.253]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[00:32:36.353 --> 00:32:39.695]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[00:32:39.795 --> 00:32:41.617]  It's actually scary.
[00:32:42.457 --> 00:32:52.484]  And it's because I take products that are researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[00:32:53.513 --> 00:33:06.336]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[00:33:12.917 --> 00:33:15.518]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.056 --> 00:33:25.578]  We are on the march.
[00:33:25.938 --> 00:33:28.320]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:33:29.081 --> 00:33:32.884]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:35.767 --> 00:33:42.794]  Alex Jones here on this live Sunday broadcast with a breakdown of just the historical hypocrisy
[00:33:43.948 --> 00:33:48.390]  It's so over-the-top, it's like it's from a dark satire novel or something.
[00:33:48.751 --> 00:33:58.756]  The rigging against Donald Trump, the lying, the twisting, Google, Facebook, Twitter, admitting that they're siding with Obama and censoring anybody promoting Trump.
[00:33:59.377 --> 00:34:03.239]  The mainstream media admitting that they're spinning polls and engage in deception.
[00:34:03.579 --> 00:34:10.703]  The fact that the debate commission now admits that Trump's mic was being faded down and was not sending audio to the crowd.
[00:34:11.283 --> 00:34:12.444]  The audience couldn't even hear him.
[00:34:12.484 --> 00:34:14.145]  They admitted yesterday that was true!
[00:34:15.506 --> 00:34:19.488]  Over and over again, I see Trump tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth.
[00:34:20.168 --> 00:34:22.570]  And they take his strongest points and they turn it against him.
[00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:28.353]  A year and a half ago, when he first announced for the presidency, he said, listen, I know all the loopholes that the elite have written in the laws.
[00:34:28.974 --> 00:34:32.116]  I will use those loopholes to bring massive money back to America.
[00:34:32.656 --> 00:34:33.436]  He gave examples.
[00:34:33.476 --> 00:34:35.257]  He said, look, the Chinese have a 10% lower
[00:34:37.418 --> 00:34:39.021]  Tax on corporations than we do.
[00:34:39.182 --> 00:34:40.865]  That makes all the corporations move there.
[00:34:41.868 --> 00:34:45.495]  We cut it down to their level or lower, they'll all come back, or a lot will.
[00:34:46.769 --> 00:34:49.852]  And then they said, oh my God, he doesn't want corporations to pay taxes.
[00:34:50.132 --> 00:34:51.954]  No, he wants to bring them back here.
[00:34:52.454 --> 00:34:54.856]  We have the highest corporate income tax in the world.
[00:34:54.936 --> 00:35:04.705]  Now, the latest thing is they have illegally gotten his tax returns from 1995, where he admittedly had a $900 million loss and declared bankruptcy in some of his companies.
[00:35:05.185 --> 00:35:07.427]  Each new venture he does is a new corporation.
[00:35:08.328 --> 00:35:10.490]  90 plus percent of his ventures have been very successful.
[00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:13.352]  Most business people, one out of six is successful.
[00:35:14.013 --> 00:35:15.834]  He's 9 out of 10 or even better.
[00:35:16.075 --> 00:35:17.756]  But he has declared bankruptcy four times.
[00:35:18.356 --> 00:35:24.942]  And he used that loss then to move forward over the next few years and basically not pay taxes because of the loss.
[00:35:25.522 --> 00:35:26.903]  That's what all the rich do.
[00:35:27.243 --> 00:35:28.625]  Google pays 3% tax.
[00:35:31.026 --> 00:35:34.148]  If you go to General Electric, 2-3% tax again.
[00:35:34.648 --> 00:35:37.970]  Some major global corporations pay zero tax.
[00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:43.533]  And then the leaders of those corporations do the exact same loopholes that Trump does and pay near zero.
[00:35:43.773 --> 00:35:47.855]  The truth is, Trump isn't elitist enough to pay no taxes like they do.
[00:35:47.975 --> 00:35:51.117]  The upper super billionaire crust.
[00:35:52.017 --> 00:35:52.558]  Are the ones.
[00:35:52.578 --> 00:35:55.965]  In fact, famous billionaires have said, taxes, those are for poor people.
[00:35:56.165 --> 00:35:56.987]  Those are for commoners.
[00:35:57.448 --> 00:36:01.656]  He wants to end all that, where China has a currency, 35%.
[00:36:03.499 --> 00:36:10.665]  Beneath ours, devalued, which again makes people go build things there because it's cheaper to manufacture.
[00:36:10.925 --> 00:36:15.328]  They've got energy three times cheaper than us because they have all these dirty coal power plants.
[00:36:15.649 --> 00:36:16.830]  They're shutting down our clean ones.
[00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:18.171]  These are simple things.
[00:36:18.451 --> 00:36:19.632]  Let us have cheap energy.
[00:36:20.192 --> 00:36:21.433]  Let us have lower taxes.
[00:36:22.074 --> 00:36:22.734]  Let us have
[00:36:24.155 --> 00:36:28.279]  A currency that isn't undervalued against others and we will explode.
[00:36:28.359 --> 00:36:29.940]  America's been the engine of the world.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.101]  We've been sold out.
[00:36:31.341 --> 00:36:38.106]  But they take this and they spin it like it's a giant controversy because the system thinks all of you are stupid.
[00:36:38.546 --> 00:36:41.729]  Trump wants to cut taxes for the super rich.
[00:36:46.909 --> 00:36:48.832]  Well, we're not going there, my friends.
[00:36:49.694 --> 00:36:57.787]  I'm telling you right now, we're going to write fairer rules for the middle class and we are going to raise taxes on the middle class!
[00:37:00.213 --> 00:37:06.316]  The establishment is hoping the general public is ignorant about the current global crony capitalist economic system.
[00:37:06.596 --> 00:37:07.856]  It's time to wake up.
[00:37:08.376 --> 00:37:13.138]  In 2014, the New York Times paid zero taxes.
[00:37:13.559 --> 00:37:17.020]  I could go on and on with example after example, and it's worse than that.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:25.183]  Carlos Slim, the Mexican kingpin, one of the richest men in the world, basically controls the New York Times and is the majority owner.
[00:37:25.444 --> 00:37:28.445]  But I'm going to ask Bernie Sanders supporters something right now.
[00:37:29.594 --> 00:37:33.860]  You claim you're against mega banks and super huge corporations that have rigged the economy, and they have.
[00:37:34.461 --> 00:37:37.385]  And you're right when you say they pay almost no taxes, and that's a screw job.
[00:37:38.627 --> 00:37:40.510]  They've given all their money to Hillary.
[00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:41.211]  98 to 2.
[00:37:43.444 --> 00:37:45.887]  Billionaires have given to Hillary.
[00:37:46.868 --> 00:37:50.111]  She's gotten 20 to 1 corporate contributions.
[00:37:50.251 --> 00:37:56.979]  There's never been a more unified Republican-Democrat power structure against a candidate in history because they know he's a nationalist.
[00:37:57.239 --> 00:37:59.081]  They know he's not out to get America.
[00:37:59.361 --> 00:38:00.603]  And now there's this new recording.
[00:38:00.643 --> 00:38:02.004]  It's posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:38:02.825 --> 00:38:14.590]  Of Hillary Clinton talking to donors, making fun of Bernie Sanders people, and calling them baristas, and saying basically they live in their mother's basement, in fact that's the quote, and that you're all a bunch of losers.
[00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:17.852]  This is what she's saying to these big fat cat corporate people.
[00:38:18.692 --> 00:38:19.992]  Who don't want to have a free market.
[00:38:20.032 --> 00:38:20.953]  They don't want competition.
[00:38:21.133 --> 00:38:22.373]  They want to sew the whole thing up.
[00:38:22.733 --> 00:38:31.015]  So you've got Sanders on the extreme left of populism, and then you've got this populist Trump, who's liberal in many ways, who you're rejecting.
[00:38:31.535 --> 00:38:33.616]  You're being chumped by the very same power structure.
[00:38:34.256 --> 00:38:37.997]  It's time for everybody to reach out to Sanders supporters with the recording of Hillary.
[00:38:38.217 --> 00:38:38.717]  And here's a clip.
[00:38:38.957 --> 00:38:43.079]  They're children of the Great Recession, and they are living in their parents' basement.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:53.685]  So if you're feeling that you're consigned to, you know, being a barista... You're not a bad person if you've been forced to stay with your parents because this economy's been in depression for eight years.
[00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:56.167]  You're not a bad person because you're a barista.
[00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:58.468]  Thank God we've still got some service industry.
[00:38:58.928 --> 00:39:00.949]  But the truth is, that's starting to contract.
[00:39:01.509 --> 00:39:04.350]  And our wealth that was saved up over a hundred years is starting to disappear.
[00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:06.410]  We've got to make America great again.
[00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:07.371]  We've got to put it first.
[00:39:07.691 --> 00:39:17.013]  The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponent is that our plan will put America first!
[00:39:17.794 --> 00:39:21.955]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:28.924]  To talk about how desperate the power structure is, look at how a month and a half ago I came out and said we should watch for election fraud because of our intel.
[00:39:29.444 --> 00:39:30.565]  Obama came out and attacked me.
[00:39:30.805 --> 00:39:31.605]  Hillary did as well.
[00:39:32.666 --> 00:39:34.227]  Trump came out and said we should look at this.
[00:39:35.353 --> 00:39:36.994]  They said, oh, he's crazy, there's no such thing.
[00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:38.294]  What is election fraud?
[00:39:38.594 --> 00:39:39.114]  Obama said.
[00:39:39.394 --> 00:39:48.597]  And then they announced two weeks later they're going to federalize the elections and it's in Bloomberg today that they have got evidence of the election system being scanned by outside groups, the Russians.
[00:39:49.197 --> 00:39:50.738]  So the feds are going to take it over.
[00:39:51.338 --> 00:39:55.279]  Ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in and only a landslide will defeat these people.
[00:39:55.839 --> 00:39:58.160]  And that's what brings me to my last central point here today.
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.801]  A man on Saturday morning
[00:40:02.409 --> 00:40:10.294]  Got behind the set, like everybody else does, with signs, with his Bill Clinton rape shirt from MFullWarStore.com, and he began to yell, Bill Clinton's a rapist now.
[00:40:11.115 --> 00:40:15.037]  He started climbing over the barricade, which you shouldn't do, you should follow the law, but he's still gonna win the $5,000.
[00:40:15.738 --> 00:40:25.804]  But just to be clear, we're not calling for violence with the media, we're calling for peacefully standing behind the camera when it's in a public area, and getting images out and audio out, exposing the tyranny that's taking place.
[00:40:26.184 --> 00:40:30.187]  We're not like Black Lives Matter, beating up people that have Trump signs in their yards,
[00:40:30.427 --> 00:40:35.150]  Beating up homeless people for no reason, you know, because they're white with George Soros funding and trying to start a race war.
[00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:41.314]  We are peacefully engaged in an information war and it's having a huge effect and history is taking place right now.
[00:40:41.374 --> 00:40:46.578]  So we need to see in the next 35 days until this election, a maximum effort because this is part of Brexit.
[00:40:46.878 --> 00:40:48.659]  It's part of Russia pulling out of the new world order.
[00:40:48.879 --> 00:40:50.701]  It's part of nationalism rising again.
[00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:53.503]  It is historic and exciting time to be alive.
[00:40:53.523 --> 00:40:56.905]  So please take action and realize that the people are on the march.
[00:40:56.965 --> 00:40:58.486]  The empire is on the run.
[00:41:07.809 --> 00:41:10.030]  There's not only evil in this world, there's good as well.
[00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:19.073]  No matter what color you are or where you're from on the planet, you can promote individualism, free market, free ideas, free association, the classical renaissance enlightenment system.
[00:41:20.376 --> 00:41:23.479]  That has developed almost all the good things we have in this world.
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.902]  We can stand up to this together.
[00:41:26.502 --> 00:41:27.523]  We can say no to this.
[00:41:27.784 --> 00:41:29.325]  But history is happening right now.
[00:41:29.605 --> 00:41:30.626]  We're at the crossroads.
[00:41:31.107 --> 00:41:33.649]  And it's now time for everybody to have the maximum effort.
[00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:36.753]  You know, I'm promising to give this fellow that did this $5,000, and I am.
[00:41:39.184 --> 00:41:41.105]  For getting the visual and the audio on air.
[00:41:41.645 --> 00:41:42.806]  If you just get the visual, it's a thousand.
[00:41:42.826 --> 00:41:44.727]  A lot of people are saying, Alex, we're insulted.
[00:41:45.187 --> 00:41:45.947]  We'll do this for free.
[00:41:46.288 --> 00:41:47.008]  That's the whole point.
[00:41:47.148 --> 00:41:48.449]  It's to begin a cascade event.
[00:41:49.029 --> 00:41:50.009]  It's to create some excitement.
[00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:51.030]  Absolutely.
[00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:52.471]  Do it for free, then.
[00:41:53.491 --> 00:41:54.732]  The point is, is expose it.
[00:41:54.812 --> 00:41:55.552]  Be part of history.
[00:41:55.632 --> 00:41:56.193]  Take action.
[00:41:56.233 --> 00:41:57.033]  Don't be a spectator.
[00:41:57.253 --> 00:41:58.534]  Be the man or woman in the arena.
[00:41:59.334 --> 00:42:00.855]  I want to salute all of you that have taken action.
[00:42:01.175 --> 00:42:02.196]  Get up every race, color, and creed.
[00:42:02.296 --> 00:42:02.996]  God bless you all.
[00:42:03.556 --> 00:42:04.717]  Because you are the resistance.
[00:42:06.144 --> 00:42:08.046]  And again, that's the way we get the information out.
[00:42:08.566 --> 00:42:12.810]  The Hillary for Prison t-shirts have been a phenomenal way to get the information out.
[00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:17.173]  We've had article after article written by the mainstream media talking about Hillary for Prison t-shirts.
[00:42:17.754 --> 00:42:18.635]  And we still have those.
[00:42:18.655 --> 00:42:19.035]  You know what?
[00:42:19.075 --> 00:42:20.296]  That's a limited edition.
[00:42:20.736 --> 00:42:24.540]  We're only going to have that for another 30 days and then it's going to become a collector's item.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.962]  You're not going to be able to get it anymore after that, after the election.
[00:42:27.302 --> 00:42:28.183]  So pick that up.
[00:42:28.223 --> 00:42:29.504]  That helps to fund the operation.
[00:42:29.524 --> 00:42:34.048]  It helps to fund our guerrilla information warfare that's going on here, folks.
[00:42:34.648 --> 00:42:37.050]  That's the whole point about the Bill Clinton rape t-shirt.
[00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:43.294]  It's only sold here, but what they're doing is, they're not selling you hope, folks.
[00:42:43.634 --> 00:42:44.815]  They're selling you envy.
[00:42:45.135 --> 00:42:46.255]  They're selling you rape.
[00:42:46.936 --> 00:42:59.564]  Bill Clinton raped all of these women, a long line of women that he has raped, and we're going to talk to Roger Stone about that in the next hour, as well as Roger Stone saying Wednesday will be the end of the Hillary Clinton campaign.
[00:43:00.245 --> 00:43:01.690]  What is WikiLeaks going to do?
[00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:03.837]  Roger Stone is going to join us in the next hour.
[00:43:03.857 --> 00:43:05.081]  We're going to talk to him exclusively.
[00:43:05.101 --> 00:43:05.442]  Stay with us.
[00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:06.004]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:09.438 --> 00:43:10.879]  Folks, the message is clear.
[00:43:11.239 --> 00:43:12.460]  The parallels are there.
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:28.311]  There are millions of ordinary Americans who've been let down, who've had a bad time, who feel the political class in Washington are detached from them, who feel so many of their representatives are politically correct parts of that liberal media elite.
[00:43:28.671 --> 00:43:35.795]  They feel people aren't standing up for them, and they've actually in many cases given up on the whole electoral process.
[00:43:35.856 --> 00:43:36.296]  And I think
[00:43:36.976 --> 00:43:41.720]  I think that you have a fantastic opportunity here with this campaign.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:42.960]  You can go out.
[00:43:43.441 --> 00:43:44.842]  You can beat the pollsters.
[00:43:45.442 --> 00:43:47.143]  You can beat the commentators.
[00:43:47.644 --> 00:43:49.345]  You can beat Washington.
[00:43:49.365 --> 00:43:53.848]  Mr. Farage, who just recently resigned as the head of UKIP, still in the EU Parliament.
[00:43:54.368 --> 00:43:54.689]  Wow!
[00:43:54.749 --> 00:43:56.830]  Talk about a David versus Goliath story.
[00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:58.431]  This is epic.
[00:43:58.451 --> 00:44:05.136]  What it is, I think the point about Brexit, Alex, is Brexit is the first victory against this phenomenon.
[00:44:05.803 --> 00:44:25.621]  Of the big banks, the big businesses, effectively owning politics, literally willfully destroying nation-state democracy, getting rid of that thing that our forebears actually fought and shed their blood to create and to preserve, our liberties, our freedoms, all of that being taken away and suddenly
[00:44:26.241 --> 00:44:30.810]  Suddenly in a referendum that no one said we could win.
[00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:35.919]  I mean literally nobody thought Brexit would succeed and we've done it.
[00:44:35.939 --> 00:44:37.943]  Hillary represents
[00:44:39.171 --> 00:44:43.175]  Everything that has gone wrong in our lives in the last couple of decades.
[00:44:43.736 --> 00:44:56.689]  She is part, you know, of that class of people who have taken us into an endless series of foreign wars that I think arguably have made things worse, certainly in Liberia and elsewhere, not better.
[00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:59.112]  She is part of that phenomenon.
[00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:03.633]  Where all that seems to matter now is corporatism.
[00:45:04.013 --> 00:45:11.819]  You know, the big global companies who want to set the rule books to effectively put out of business small and medium-sized competitors.
[00:45:12.319 --> 00:45:21.466]  They have destroyed, you know, what I believe to be proper free market capitalism, where your eye can go and set up a company, you know, and have a real chance of succeeding.
[00:45:22.006 --> 00:45:31.072]  And they've presided over a period where the rich have got richer, and where ordinary, decent, working people have seen their living standards deteriorate.
[00:45:31.432 --> 00:45:33.173]  She represents failure.
[00:45:33.373 --> 00:45:40.718]  And she, of course, is completely unreconciled to the vote on Brexit, because Hillary loves the European Union.
[00:45:41.058 --> 00:45:47.102]  I think she sees the European Union as a prototype for an even bigger form of world government.
[00:45:47.222 --> 00:45:48.383]  But let me make it clear.
[00:45:49.183 --> 00:46:03.487]  If you want nothing to change at all, if you want to continue with the kind of cronyism that we see with the Clinton Foundation and everything else, if you want things to stay the same, you vote for Hillary.
[00:46:03.907 --> 00:46:08.088]  I wouldn't vote for Hillary if she paid me, and I feel pretty strongly about that.
[00:46:09.412 --> 00:46:11.453]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.

[00:47:13.313 --> 00:47:15.914]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:23.157 --> 00:47:27.884]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:47:28.746 --> 00:47:30.348]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:33.553 --> 00:47:34.833]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:34.893 --> 00:47:37.714]  I'm David Knight, and joining us in the next hour is going to be Roger Stone.
[00:47:38.114 --> 00:47:42.255]  He tweeted out today that Wednesday will be the end of Hillary's campaign.
[00:47:42.715 --> 00:47:44.015]  Hashtag WiggyLeaks.
[00:47:44.135 --> 00:47:51.757]  So we've got him on to explain that, as well as to talk about all the developments that have happened in the last, say, 48 hours with the Trump campaign.
[00:47:51.797 --> 00:47:52.797]  A lot of things have happened.
[00:47:53.357 --> 00:47:55.117]  One of these, the tax information.
[00:47:55.177 --> 00:47:56.337]  I started talking about that earlier.
[00:47:56.357 --> 00:47:57.798]  I want to finish up with that as well.
[00:47:57.818 --> 00:47:58.438]  But when we look at
[00:47:59.358 --> 00:48:12.568]  The release of this information that Alex was just talking about, calling, with Hillary Clinton calling the Millennials basement dwellers and baristas, talking about the children of the Great Recession, as she puts it.
[00:48:13.149 --> 00:48:14.970]  Let's understand what's going on with this, folks.
[00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:17.272]  We look at another article that came out today.
[00:48:17.372 --> 00:48:20.914]  Clinton announces today National Service Reserve for Millennials.
[00:48:21.815 --> 00:48:25.137]  I'm afraid that the people, the Millennials are people about 18 to 30 years old.
[00:48:25.198 --> 00:48:26.539]  It's my sons are that age.
[00:48:27.452 --> 00:48:38.038]  And I really feel sorry for them, because they have had their opportunities destroyed by the policies of big government, especially by Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[00:48:38.078 --> 00:48:42.301]  And she's going to double down on those policies to the extent that you won't have a job
[00:48:43.041 --> 00:48:47.404]  You won't have any ability, and neither will your parents, to help you through college.
[00:48:47.484 --> 00:48:49.746]  No, you'll be dependent upon the federal government.
[00:48:50.166 --> 00:49:03.777]  If you're a good little boy or girl, and you go to the National Service Reserve, and you do the things that Hillary Clinton tells you to do, whether or not the market wants that or not, whether or not anybody voluntarily wants that, they're going to tell you that it's a good thing, because the government says it's a good thing.
[00:49:04.557 --> 00:49:11.180]  And if you go in and do what they say, as their little slave, they may throw you some little pork barrel trinkets.
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:16.263]  They said you might be eligible, you might be eligible for college credit based on your financial need.
[00:49:16.803 --> 00:49:20.185]  Or you might be able to get time off from work based on financial need.
[00:49:20.265 --> 00:49:22.206]  Or you might get a modest stipend.
[00:49:22.666 --> 00:49:25.408]  In other words, they're going to barely pay you, if at all.
[00:49:25.428 --> 00:49:27.729]  They're going to find some ways and not pay you.
[00:49:28.089 --> 00:49:31.451]  But they want to push you into this mandatory service.
[00:49:31.551 --> 00:49:34.112]  This is something that is so dear to the heart
[00:49:34.632 --> 00:49:37.756]  Of the socialist authoritarians like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
[00:49:38.356 --> 00:49:48.347]  The two of them are always talking about the dream that they have of forcing young people into government service to do whatever they say to do because they want to control you totally.
[00:49:48.787 --> 00:49:54.173]  Understand, they want to put you on a plantation as their slave and they may give you some little trinkets.
[00:49:54.774 --> 00:49:55.134]  They say,
[00:49:56.383 --> 00:50:02.485]  Clinton will negotiate with higher education institutions and corporations to get those benefits.
[00:50:02.826 --> 00:50:05.026]  In other words, the government isn't even going to pay you.
[00:50:05.147 --> 00:50:11.849]  They're going to strong-arm people, or they're going to put out mandates and fatwas to force companies to do that.
[00:50:11.889 --> 00:50:12.970]  That's the way they're rolling with this.
[00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:15.551]  You have to understand, they're not offering you hope.
[00:50:16.411 --> 00:50:17.852]  They're offering you envy.
[00:50:18.672 --> 00:50:20.654]  And they're offering to rape the economy.
[00:50:21.114 --> 00:50:22.415]  Let me give you an example of that.
[00:50:22.455 --> 00:50:23.856]  Let's talk about what's going on with this.
[00:50:23.876 --> 00:50:27.478]  Because, you know, they want to misdirect you constantly, throw out these red herrings.
[00:50:27.518 --> 00:50:29.399]  And we start to look at some of the real issues.
[00:50:29.419 --> 00:50:30.280]  They say, oh, no, no, no.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.621]  They pull out the smelly fish.
[00:50:32.563 --> 00:50:36.624]  Drag it along the trail, and then you lose track of where you're going.
[00:50:37.164 --> 00:50:40.845]  Completely destroy, completely lose the scent that you're following down.
[00:50:41.205 --> 00:50:44.166]  I want to go back to this article from Time Magazine back in July.
[00:50:44.186 --> 00:50:46.606]  What would Clinton and Trump tax plans mean for you?
[00:50:47.446 --> 00:50:50.407]  This is not a conservative organization looking at this.
[00:50:50.427 --> 00:50:54.188]  This is Time Magazine, and they're looking at various
[00:50:55.673 --> 00:50:57.954]  Groups of people, different income groups.
[00:50:58.375 --> 00:50:59.956]  What would these tax plans mean for you?
[00:50:59.996 --> 00:51:01.196]  So they pull up several of them.
[00:51:01.496 --> 00:51:02.357]  Here's one right here.
[00:51:02.497 --> 00:51:05.659]  Singles and married joint filers earning between $23,000 and $45,000.
[00:51:05.699 --> 00:51:06.059]  Average income $35,000.
[00:51:06.099 --> 00:51:06.599]  So think about that.
[00:51:06.619 --> 00:51:06.839]  About $35,000.
[00:51:06.879 --> 00:51:10.582]  They say if you're a full-time Walmart employee making $13 an hour, then that would equate to about $27,000 a year.
[00:51:10.602 --> 00:51:11.542]  So you'd be right in the middle of this
[00:51:22.808 --> 00:51:24.808]  You'd be kind of on the lower end of it, actually.
[00:51:24.828 --> 00:51:26.049]  $23,000 to $45,000.
[00:51:26.529 --> 00:51:27.769]  Okay, what would happen to you?
[00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:31.450]  You'd get a tax increase under Hillary Clinton.
[00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:34.030]  You'd get a tax decrease under Donald Trump.
[00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:40.491]  So you'd get $15 more taxes per year under Hillary Clinton, or under Donald Trump you'd get $969 less.
[00:51:40.511 --> 00:51:49.813]  So let me say to you that if you're working in retail, you're working at about $13 an hour, even at that magic number of $15 an hour that they're pushing for.
[00:51:50.765 --> 00:51:58.392]  Then what that means to you is that the difference between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is going to be about $1,000 a year for you.
[00:51:58.412 --> 00:51:58.692]  $984 a year.
[00:52:00.294 --> 00:52:01.835]  Can you afford to just throw that away?
[00:52:02.496 --> 00:52:04.317]  And understand, that's going to be per year.
[00:52:04.598 --> 00:52:10.463]  So over four years, it's about $3,900 more that you're going to be paying under Hillary Clinton.
[00:52:10.483 --> 00:52:11.584]  That's for the Walmart workers.
[00:52:11.704 --> 00:52:12.965]  What about people who are making
[00:52:14.068 --> 00:52:15.229]  Uh, between $81,000 and $143,000.
[00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:18.513]  Average income $112,000.
[00:52:18.593 --> 00:52:26.842]  Well, those people would see a tax hike from Hillary Clinton and a tax cut of $5,300 from Donald Trump.
[00:52:26.942 --> 00:52:30.005]  In other words, the combined difference between the two would be $5,500 and $1,212.
[00:52:30.206 --> 00:52:30.866]  So, if Hillary Clinton
[00:52:36.713 --> 00:52:43.620]  ...becomes president, those people would pay $5,512 more per year than they would under Donald Trump, or over a period of four years, about $22,000.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.941]  You see how that works?
[00:52:51.584 --> 00:52:54.825]  Let's take somebody that is at the very top, okay?
[00:52:55.665 --> 00:52:57.866]  Those people are also going to get their taxes cut.
[00:52:58.446 --> 00:53:00.587]  And so that's the way Time Magazine spends it.
[00:53:01.007 --> 00:53:08.050]  It's politics of envy, saying, oh, look at this, the people at the top are going to get an even bigger tax decrease.
[00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:18.793]  You know, the people that I just, those two groups I just gave you, people making on average $112,000, that group of people, they would make, they would save about $22,000 over
[00:53:21.724 --> 00:53:22.324]  Four years.
[00:53:22.524 --> 00:53:28.685]  The people at the lower level, the Walmart workers, would save about $4,000 over four years.
[00:53:29.326 --> 00:53:30.626]  Because they're making a lot less.
[00:53:30.706 --> 00:53:33.326]  They're making about one-fifth of what the other people are making.
[00:53:33.647 --> 00:53:34.867]  That's the way percentages work.
[00:53:35.547 --> 00:53:46.129]  And you know, even though they have what they call a progressive income tax system, where the percentages go up as your income goes up, you're still always going to see a bigger tax break for the people at the top.
[00:53:46.669 --> 00:53:49.610]  And so the way the Democrats spend that is by using envy.
[00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:53.611]  They tell you, you don't want to vote for somebody that's going to save you $4,000.
[00:53:54.651 --> 00:53:56.252]  Because somebody else is going to save more.
[00:53:57.192 --> 00:53:58.553]  So you don't want that to happen.
[00:53:58.833 --> 00:54:03.154]  Because the other people in the middle class, they're going to save $22,000 over four years.
[00:54:03.174 --> 00:54:03.974]  You're only going to save $4,000.
[00:54:04.435 --> 00:54:07.396]  So you should vote for the person that's going to cost you $4,000.
[00:54:09.087 --> 00:54:10.588]  Because you don't want to see somebody else get ahead.
[00:54:10.608 --> 00:54:11.848]  See, that's the politics of envy.
[00:54:12.509 --> 00:54:15.890]  It's also the politics of rape, of economic rape.
[00:54:15.930 --> 00:54:22.814]  You know, it's the economy, stupid, as Bill Clinton and his campaign staff understood the first time he ran for president.
[00:54:23.294 --> 00:54:24.755]  Take a look at the last one they look here.
[00:54:24.795 --> 00:54:27.596]  They look at all these different income groups.
[00:54:28.316 --> 00:54:29.937]  And the last one they look at is Uncle Sam.
[00:54:29.957 --> 00:54:33.579]  How does Uncle Sam fare under Hillary Clinton and under Donald Trump?
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:38.202]  Well, under Hillary Clinton, Uncle Sam gets more money.
[00:54:38.622 --> 00:54:40.443]  He gets $30 billion more.
[00:54:40.983 --> 00:54:45.826]  Under Donald Trump, Uncle Sam gets $545 billion less.
[00:54:46.506 --> 00:54:46.827]  Okay?
[00:54:47.247 --> 00:54:57.872]  So Uncle Sam has a difference of $575 billion difference between Hillary and Donald each year.
[00:54:58.253 --> 00:55:01.074]  So over four years, you're looking at about $2,300 billion, or $2.3 trillion.
[00:55:03.766 --> 00:55:20.915]  That's a massive amount of money that is going to be pulled out of the economy, pulled away from small businesses, pulled away from individuals, pulled away from employees who are going to not see pay raises because their employer was paying more taxes or had to pay more Obamacare mandates or whatever.
[00:55:20.935 --> 00:55:25.237]  That's not even looking at the tax we call Obamacare.
[00:55:26.097 --> 00:55:30.720]  Think about the fact that we had 16,000 new IRS agents added to administer this tax.
[00:55:31.912 --> 00:55:32.632]  It is a mandate.
[00:55:32.873 --> 00:55:34.313]  It is an unconstitutional mandate.
[00:55:34.353 --> 00:55:34.994]  But it is true.
[00:55:35.074 --> 00:55:36.054]  It is a tax as well.
[00:55:36.394 --> 00:55:44.819]  It is a tax that goes from you to the private insurance corporations that got Obama and Hillary to write their rules to make money for them.
[00:55:46.223 --> 00:55:47.344]  That's a good example right there.
[00:55:47.384 --> 00:55:57.170]  If you look at the difference in just Obamacare, understand that people have already seen a 50% to 300% increase in insurance premiums under Obamacare.
[00:55:57.271 --> 00:56:01.293]  And they're hiding a massive increase that's going to take place right after the election.
[00:56:01.313 --> 00:56:02.734]  It's going to be a minimum of 50 to 60%.
[00:56:03.435 --> 00:56:10.940]  We see insurance Obamacare markets, as they call them, quote-unquote, that are going to be going bankrupt.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:15.203]  There's an article up on Drudge Report today about one state where the Obamacare
[00:56:16.286 --> 00:56:21.247]  Institutions are going to be going bankrupt unless they have a 50 to 60 percent increase right away.
[00:56:21.267 --> 00:56:29.690]  You have to understand, this is something that was written by the big insurance companies for the benefit of the big insurance companies.
[00:56:30.830 --> 00:56:34.791]  And you should understand how this is going to take even more money out of the economy.
[00:56:35.953 --> 00:56:47.103]  The people at the very lowest, they again, they sell this idea of envy, hoping that you don't look at the fact that the people at the very lowest level, they talk about Donald Trump having three different tax rates that he's proposed here.
[00:56:47.583 --> 00:56:48.484]  No, he's actually got four.
[00:56:49.165 --> 00:56:50.346]  The fourth rate is zero.
[00:56:51.687 --> 00:56:59.113]  That's the people that are making taxes that are, a single person making $25,000 a year pays zero taxes under his plan.
[00:57:02.639 --> 00:57:03.479]  But you don't want that.
[00:57:03.899 --> 00:57:08.661]  Because somebody that's making a lot more money than you is going to get more of a tax savings than you do.
[00:57:08.741 --> 00:57:11.421]  So you should shut this whole thing down and pay Hillary more taxes.
[00:57:12.162 --> 00:57:16.143]  See, that's the kind of thinking that keeps people in the basement.
[00:57:17.123 --> 00:57:18.283]  Literally in the basement.
[00:57:18.403 --> 00:57:19.464]  In their parents' basement.
[00:57:19.504 --> 00:57:22.645]  Because they can't have any opportunity.
[00:57:22.825 --> 00:57:24.165]  You understand, these are also the people
[00:57:25.572 --> 00:57:33.399]  Who are bringing in so many foreign workers that the young people, the millennials, can't find part-time work in the first place.
[00:57:34.471 --> 00:57:36.092]  That is, I think, one of the biggest crimes.
[00:57:36.132 --> 00:57:46.615]  The fact that they have shut that down to them just as they have made it more expensive for them to get cars and made it impossible for them to find jobs because they're competing with adults looking for full-time work that aren't even American citizens.
[00:57:46.635 --> 00:57:47.575]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:57:47.695 --> 00:57:47.575]  2016.
[00:57:47.855 --> 00:57:53.397]  We are now 36 days out from the November elections.
[00:57:53.717 --> 00:57:55.698]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:57:58.849 --> 00:57:59.850]  Brain Force is here.
[00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:02.672]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:58:02.933 --> 00:58:10.760]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:58:11.536 --> 00:58:14.679]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:58:14.979 --> 00:58:15.119]  Right?
[00:58:15.139 --> 00:58:17.481]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:58:17.841 --> 00:58:21.344]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:58:21.404 --> 00:58:24.547]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:58:25.047 --> 00:58:29.831]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:58:30.371 --> 00:58:32.213]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:58:32.553 --> 00:58:36.997]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:58:37.157 --> 00:58:39.158]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:58:39.779 --> 00:58:41.240]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:41.640]  Exactly.
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:45.463]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:58:45.943 --> 00:58:53.949]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:58:58.584 --> 00:59:08.190]  Now we are introducing a new t-shirt, which I think folks need to get, telling the real truth about Bill Clinton, who is a serial rapist and a user of women.
[00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:12.093]  In another case, it's about groping and fondling and touching against a woman's will.
[00:59:12.253 --> 00:59:12.633]  And rape.
[00:59:12.793 --> 00:59:13.173]  And rape.
[00:59:13.233 --> 00:59:17.416]  Bill rapes them physically, and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[00:59:17.476 --> 00:59:18.116]  He's a rapist.
[00:59:18.657 --> 00:59:19.097]  Absolutely.
[00:59:19.117 --> 00:59:20.418]  He's a public figure, he goes straight to hell.
[00:59:20.578 --> 00:59:28.383]  Get your Bill Clinton rape shirt today at InfoWarsStore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:59:28.783 --> 00:59:31.465]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:59:31.665 --> 00:59:34.767]  That communist Chinese-style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:59:35.087 --> 00:59:35.828]  Because it's already here.
[00:59:36.208 --> 00:59:36.868]  It's being announced.
[00:59:37.229 --> 00:59:40.711]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:59:41.111 --> 00:59:43.072]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:59:43.152 --> 00:59:44.713]  A new battleship in the fight.
[00:59:44.913 --> 00:59:45.914]  InfoWars Live.
[00:59:46.094 --> 00:59:46.915]  Available right now.
[00:59:47.195 --> 00:59:48.596]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[00:59:48.916 --> 00:59:51.358]  You're gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[00:59:51.918 --> 00:59:52.979]  Or are you gonna be part of history?
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:56.502]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you!
[00:59:57.043 --> 00:59:57.663]  Take action!
[01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:07.411]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.595 --> 01:00:16.559]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.257 --> 01:00:22.638]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:22.718 --> 01:00:23.118]  I'm David Knight.
[01:00:23.178 --> 01:00:25.420]  In the next segment, we're going to be joined by Roger Stone.
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:31.424]  He's going to give us his exclusive update on what's going to happen on Wednesday.
[01:00:31.484 --> 01:00:38.789]  He tweeted out and referenced WikiLeaks that on Wednesday, the Hillary Clinton campaign will be done, will be finished.
[01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:46.654]  We're going to talk to him about what he sees happening on Wednesday with Julian Assange and about the other things that have broken over the last 48 hours.
[01:00:46.754 --> 01:00:48.375]  There's been a lot of news coming out.
[01:00:48.735 --> 01:00:50.937]  As I was talking about in the last segment, again,
[01:00:51.878 --> 01:01:01.826]  Pulling out this information about Donald Trump's tax returns saying that he had nearly a billion dollars in a loss and we don't know whether that was a failed business or whether that was a defrauding.
[01:01:02.186 --> 01:01:04.108]  Somebody defrauded him and he got a lawsuit.
[01:01:04.148 --> 01:01:08.011]  As I pointed out, I know someone who had a situation trying to build a home.
[01:01:08.672 --> 01:01:15.016]  They had the builder go bankrupt, abscond with a lot of their money, as did many other potential homeowners.
[01:01:15.196 --> 01:01:18.978]  They were never able to get that money back from them, even though it was owed to them.
[01:01:19.459 --> 01:01:27.323]  But when you have a loss like that, whether it is a business loss or whether it is something like that, where you're defrauded, you have to take that each year.
[01:01:27.704 --> 01:01:33.027]  And you can take up to 20 years to take that off, but the only way that you can recover that, if somebody doesn't pay you,
[01:01:33.827 --> 01:01:35.069]  Is to take that gradually.
[01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:44.139]  So we don't know what the case is with Donald Trump's situation, but what they're trying to do is get you angry about the fact that he took a tax deduction.
[01:01:44.539 --> 01:01:46.021]  Do you take your mortgage deduction?
[01:01:46.061 --> 01:01:47.382]  Would you like to have more deductions?
[01:01:47.402 --> 01:01:49.304]  Do you use all the mortgage deductions that you have?
[01:01:49.725 --> 01:01:50.466]  If not, why not?
[01:01:50.486 --> 01:01:52.227]  And if you don't, you're foolish!
[01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:54.371]  You're foolish not to do that.
[01:01:55.131 --> 01:01:56.633]  If it's a legal deduction, you should be able to.
[01:01:56.673 --> 01:01:58.735]  They're not accusing him of cheating.
[01:01:58.755 --> 01:02:00.736]  They're not accusing him of tax evasion.
[01:02:00.916 --> 01:02:01.317]  Okay?
[01:02:01.337 --> 01:02:06.901]  It's the difference between a legal profit that you make in a business and money laundering.
[01:02:06.921 --> 01:02:08.142]  Do you understand the difference there?
[01:02:08.623 --> 01:02:13.047]  You can have a straight-up business where you are operating publicly and making a profit.
[01:02:13.787 --> 01:02:17.311]  Doing all the paperwork for the government, paying them their taxes, so forth and so on.
[01:02:17.351 --> 01:02:18.793]  That's a profit, okay?
[01:02:18.813 --> 01:02:20.334]  You're trying to avoid paying taxes.
[01:02:20.715 --> 01:02:24.318]  But if you've got a criminal operation, like you're selling drugs or something, okay?
[01:02:24.739 --> 01:02:28.363]  And, again, I'm not saying that selling drugs should be criminal.
[01:02:28.383 --> 01:02:30.405]  I'm not in favor of prohibition, but let's... whatever.
[01:02:30.465 --> 01:02:31.846]  Whatever it is that you're doing, okay?
[01:02:31.867 --> 01:02:33.028]  Let's say there's something violent.
[01:02:34.106 --> 01:02:37.730]  But it's illegal and so what you do is you try to wash that money and make it look like it's legal.
[01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:47.679]  So you open up a restaurant or something and you channel your illegal money through there or you channel it through HSBC where FBI Director Comey used to sit on the board of directors.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:54.325]  You channel it through those people just like El Chapo did when he had his own checkout window at HSBC.
[01:02:54.666 --> 01:02:55.446]  You clean up your money.
[01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:56.933]  And then you get it in.
[01:02:56.973 --> 01:02:59.575]  That's the difference that we're talking about here, folks.
[01:02:59.595 --> 01:03:05.381]  We're talking about the difference between having a profit and doing something criminal, like money laundering.
[01:03:05.761 --> 01:03:07.863]  It is not wrong to try to avoid taxes.
[01:03:07.903 --> 01:03:10.866]  And yet, the New York Times tries to imply that there's something wrong.
[01:03:11.346 --> 01:03:13.469]  In 2014, paid no taxes at all.
[01:03:13.509 --> 01:03:16.833]  Let me read you this quote from Forbes Magazine that Breitbart puts out.
[01:03:16.853 --> 01:03:26.206]  They say, for the tax year 2014, the New York Times paid no taxes, yet got an income tax refund of $3 million, even though they had a pre-tax profit of $29.9 million.
[01:03:26.226 --> 01:03:26.787]  Do you understand that?
[01:03:28.669 --> 01:03:33.031]  They got a profit, before taxes, of 30 million dollars, they get a refund of 3.
[01:03:33.711 --> 01:03:41.454]  And as Forbes says, think about that, their post-tax profit was higher than their pre-tax profit, New York Times.
[01:03:42.195 --> 01:03:44.055]  They say the explanation for this is in their 2014 annual report.
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:58.570]  The effective tax rate for 2014, they said, was favorably affected by approximately $21.1 million for the reversal of revenues for uncertain tax positions due to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations.
[01:03:59.191 --> 01:03:59.491]  Got that?
[01:03:59.511 --> 01:04:00.612]  Do you understand that?
[01:04:00.632 --> 01:04:02.193]  Do you understand that complexity?
[01:04:02.233 --> 01:04:02.874]  I don't understand it.
[01:04:02.894 --> 01:04:06.016]  Let me read that to you a second time and say, if you don't know what that is, read it a second time.
[01:04:06.036 --> 01:04:07.217]  Well, we'll read it a second time.
[01:04:08.118 --> 01:04:14.362]  The reversal of revenues for uncertain tax positions due to a lapse of applicable statutes of limitations.
[01:04:14.542 --> 01:04:15.903]  I have no idea what that means.
[01:04:16.823 --> 01:04:18.004]  But that's the games that they play.
[01:04:18.044 --> 01:04:26.029]  That's the games the New York Times plays to make sure that they not only don't pay any taxes, but they have a profit of $30 million and they get back another $3 million.
[01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:28.770]  See, that's the hypocrisy.
[01:04:30.011 --> 01:04:31.112]  And at the same time,
[01:04:32.062 --> 01:04:41.965]  They put this out there because they don't want you to focus on the fact that Donald Trump is proposing the largest tax simplification and tax reduction ever proposed.
[01:04:42.525 --> 01:04:43.485]  Bigger than JFK.
[01:04:43.966 --> 01:04:44.866]  Bigger than Ronald Reagan.
[01:04:45.446 --> 01:04:50.988]  And yet Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes to the highest rate that we have seen across the board.
[01:04:51.008 --> 01:04:53.888]  She wants to raise taxes on everyone and at the top end go up to 65%.
[01:04:55.689 --> 01:04:58.255]  That's what I call trickle-down poverty, folks.
[01:04:58.936 --> 01:05:01.080]  Those higher rates are going to trickle down to you as well.
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:01.441]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.461 --> 01:05:03.024]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[01:05:09.867 --> 01:05:18.290]  LA Times Daybreak Poll this morning shows Donald Trump still ahead of Hillary Clinton and gaining ground while Hillary Clinton took a nosedive.
[01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:22.611]  Strangely enough, in the same poll, Clinton was voted most likely to win.
[01:05:22.991 --> 01:05:27.633]  Is this America showing its brainwashing or feeling this election is going to be rigged?
[01:05:27.973 --> 01:05:34.035]  Every poll on earth except CNN's, which Infowars exposed as rigged, had Donald Trump winning the debate.
[01:05:34.375 --> 01:05:37.017]  Trump is winning in rally turnout by tens of thousands.
[01:05:37.478 --> 01:05:40.801]  And now Trump is consistently winning in major presidential polls.
[01:05:41.181 --> 01:05:43.623]  Will the mainstream media still pretend Clinton is winning?
[01:05:44.044 --> 01:05:48.488]  Will the Democrats try to steal this election with illegal voters or rigged voting machines?
[01:05:48.968 --> 01:05:56.415]  A new movement has started on social media calling for Trump supporters to wear red on election day in order to help avoid a rigged election.
[01:05:56.735 --> 01:05:57.756]  I'll have my red on.
[01:05:58.016 --> 01:05:58.337]  Will you?
[01:05:59.097 --> 01:06:03.384]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[01:06:03.965 --> 01:06:09.513]  This is Owen Schroer from InfoWars.com Remember to download the new app, InfoWars Live!
[01:06:13.318 --> 01:06:16.019]  It's Sunday, October 2nd, 2016.
[01:06:16.979 --> 01:06:21.820]  We are now only 36 short days before the historic election.
[01:06:24.161 --> 01:06:27.382]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our maximum.
[01:06:27.742 --> 01:06:30.903]  That's what Donald Trump said back in Cleveland in July.
[01:06:31.183 --> 01:06:33.763]  And it has the new world order panicking today.
[01:06:35.504 --> 01:06:40.725]  You're listening to the undisputed number one voice globally against the new world order.
[01:06:42.006 --> 01:06:44.068]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:06.121 --> 01:07:06.781]  Great to be here.
[01:07:07.642 --> 01:07:09.483]  Okay, tell us what is coming.
[01:07:09.523 --> 01:07:15.345]  Well, first, before we do that, let's talk about what happened yesterday with the guerrilla marketing that we saw there on Fox News.
[01:07:16.346 --> 01:07:28.692]  That was an amazing piece right there, and I think that tells us a lot about the power of the mass public in terms of the awakening of people and also getting this information out to people in unusual ways.
[01:07:28.752 --> 01:07:29.872]  I think that was very effective.
[01:07:29.912 --> 01:07:30.853]  What's your take on that?
[01:07:31.693 --> 01:07:35.235]  What it shows, David, is that one person can make a difference.
[01:07:35.979 --> 01:07:47.908]  The mainstream media wants to obliterate the narrative about Bill Clinton and his sexual predator nature.
[01:07:48.388 --> 01:07:57.015]  The fact that he has sexually assaulted or bitten or raped or exposed himself to at least 13 women that we know of.
[01:07:58.176 --> 01:08:05.181]  And that his wife, Hillary Clinton, has been an accessory after the fact in every one of those assaults.
[01:08:05.785 --> 01:08:12.830]  Because she is the one who intimidates, threatens, discredits, and bullies his victims.
[01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:20.635]  In the case of Juanita Broderick, a very brave lady, she intimidated Juanita to her face.
[01:08:20.775 --> 01:08:28.560]  Now, the mainstream media hates this narrative, and therefore they want to transpose it into affairs.
[01:08:29.707 --> 01:08:34.489]  You know, Bill's marriage, this has nothing to do with affairs or his marriage.
[01:08:34.509 --> 01:08:37.191]  It is not about marital infidelity.
[01:08:37.391 --> 01:08:39.572]  It is not about adultery.
[01:08:39.772 --> 01:08:47.816]  It is not about girlfriends or mistresses or one night stands or what my friends in Philadelphia call the guma.
[01:08:48.456 --> 01:08:50.037]  It's about sexual assault.
[01:08:50.618 --> 01:08:53.099]  It's about violence against women.
[01:08:53.799 --> 01:08:59.182]  And for example, Michael Smirconish of CNN,
[01:08:59.977 --> 01:09:00.277]  I don't
[01:09:13.188 --> 01:09:17.930]  He was once the right-hand man to Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo.
[01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:30.837]  I got him a position as a high-level appointee in the Reagan administration, where he was the regional administrator for housing and urban development, a job
[01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:36.042]  From which he was ultimately fired because he could not follow directions.
[01:09:36.342 --> 01:09:40.807]  It's not that Michael has a lot of enemies, it's just that all of his friends hate him.
[01:09:41.328 --> 01:09:52.920]  In any event, yesterday on CNN, when a surrogate for Donald Trump began to discuss Bill's epic sexual abuse of women,
[01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:59.230]  Michael kept referring to it as infidelities and, you know, about his marriage.
[01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:01.311]  This is intellectually dishonest.
[01:10:01.391 --> 01:10:04.191]  Now, Michael Smirconish is a lawyer.
[01:10:04.331 --> 01:10:06.352]  In fact, he's a very fine lawyer.
[01:10:06.772 --> 01:10:10.292]  And he knows the difference between infidelity and rape.
[01:10:10.792 --> 01:10:16.834]  If he doesn't, he should refresh himself on the rape statutes in Pennsylvania state law.
[01:10:17.454 --> 01:10:22.795]  So, this is a phony narrative put forward by the mainstream media.
[01:10:23.542 --> 01:10:48.520]  This is why it's important that people who support the cause, who are enlisted in the Infowar, get on the media and take up Alex Jones' challenge to get on television wearing your rape t-shirt, your iconic Bill Clinton rape t-shirt, written about in Time Magazine, available at the Infowars.com store.
[01:10:49.082 --> 01:10:53.003]  Available at the StoneColdTruth.com store.
[01:10:53.023 --> 01:11:00.626]  And by the way, Alex and I have agreed to donate a portion of the proceeds to a rape crisis center.
[01:11:01.426 --> 01:11:04.467]  But it's important that people take Alex up on this challenge.
[01:11:04.507 --> 01:11:08.628]  The mainstream media is not going to report this honestly.
[01:11:08.908 --> 01:11:09.428]  Well, absolutely.
[01:11:09.449 --> 01:11:13.172]  You know, you go back and you look at what happened in the 1990s and the impeachment of Bill Clinton.
[01:11:13.632 --> 01:11:16.935]  And the impeachment, technically, was for committing perjury.
[01:11:16.955 --> 01:11:19.637]  And I've tried to explain that many times to my liberal friends.
[01:11:19.657 --> 01:11:21.839]  They say, oh, they just went after him because he had an affair.
[01:11:21.879 --> 01:11:23.380]  Everybody has affairs, so forth and so on.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:29.826]  They always make it about consensual sex, not about the sexual assault, not about the rape.
[01:11:30.166 --> 01:11:31.327]  They've always covered that up.
[01:11:31.367 --> 01:11:34.390]  That's one of the reasons why they focus so heavily on Monica Lewinsky.
[01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:48.573]  Because that was a consensual issue, but they would completely avoid Juanita Broderick or Kathleen Willey or all these other women that you mentioned, 13 or so women that have come out and said that they were raped by him without consent.
[01:11:48.593 --> 01:11:53.173]  And that's a huge difference there, but that's why we have the rape t-shirt.
[01:11:53.614 --> 01:11:55.774]  That is the point that needs to be driven home.
[01:11:55.834 --> 01:11:58.074]  It is not about consensual sex.
[01:11:58.114 --> 01:12:00.475]  It is not about some guy who's a philanderer.
[01:12:01.255 --> 01:12:04.356]  My friends will also look at this and say, oh, yeah, he's a real stud.
[01:12:05.636 --> 01:12:08.197]  He may be a philanderer, but all these women really love him.
[01:12:08.237 --> 01:12:10.097]  And it makes them even cooler in their eyes.
[01:12:10.577 --> 01:12:11.678]  And yet it's about rape.
[01:12:12.238 --> 01:12:13.478]  That's why we put that there.
[01:12:13.578 --> 01:12:14.658]  It is about rape.
[01:12:14.738 --> 01:12:20.980]  It is about the abuse of women and the fact that Hillary Clinton joined in with him in cold blood.
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:25.541]  You could say that what she did, I think, is even worse than what Bill Clinton did.
[01:12:25.561 --> 01:12:29.123]  I mean, what she did was completely cold-blooded.
[01:12:29.163 --> 01:12:32.824]  You can't even say that it was a crime of passion in any sense.
[01:12:32.904 --> 01:12:37.025]  And I'm not saying that rape is excusable because some guy is passionate about it.
[01:12:37.265 --> 01:12:44.928]  But I'm saying that what she did was simply from a cold political perspective damaging these women, as many of them have said,
[01:12:45.968 --> 01:12:50.690]  In a way that was lasting beyond the physical abuse even that Bill Clinton did.
[01:12:51.030 --> 01:13:00.415]  The fact that Juanita Broderick says she can't get over the fact that she was raped and she was actually a year younger than Chelsea Clinton is today.
[01:13:00.775 --> 01:13:05.797]  So put that in perspective as Donald Trump kind of pulled back and said I don't want to talk about this with Chelsea.
[01:13:05.837 --> 01:13:08.279]  Chelsea's a year older than Juanita Broderick was when she was raped.
[01:13:08.579 --> 01:13:13.281]  That never goes away for her but it also never goes away for her the fact that she was threatened to her face by Hillary Clinton.
[01:13:13.902 --> 01:13:15.323]  Well, and she was bitten twice.
[01:13:15.783 --> 01:13:17.063]  This is Bill's MO.
[01:13:17.123 --> 01:13:28.088]  At least three women, confirmed by NBC's Mike Isikoff and confirmed by the Washington Post, that he bites through the upper lip of his victims.
[01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:32.811]  It's a very common disabling move for rapists.
[01:13:33.351 --> 01:13:37.593]  Now, I understand that the mainstream media doesn't want to talk about this.
[01:13:38.153 --> 01:13:42.015]  Sam Stein at the Huffington Post has a piece up now
[01:13:42.742 --> 01:13:43.143]  I don't know.
[01:13:52.156 --> 01:13:53.877]  This is intellectually dishonest.
[01:13:53.917 --> 01:14:12.925]  The issue here has nothing to do with consensual sex, whether it is Juanita Broderick, or Kathleen Willey, or Paula Jones, or Christy Zurcher, or Sandra Allen James, or Liz Ward Grayson, although she changed her story after she was given a bit part by a Clinton crony in Hollywood.
[01:14:13.245 --> 01:14:15.466]  These women were all sexually assaulted.
[01:14:15.547 --> 01:14:18.728]  What could be more politically incorrect
[01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:23.025]  Then sexual assault and violence against women.
[01:14:23.146 --> 01:14:25.246]  That is the issue here.
[01:14:26.207 --> 01:14:30.008]  They get a free pass for this because Hillary is a woman.
[01:14:30.048 --> 01:14:30.809]  Isn't that ironic?
[01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:41.793]  It was a misstep for Donald Trump to post last week that he was considering inviting Jennifer Flowers
[01:14:42.526 --> 01:14:43.606]  To sit in the front row.
[01:14:43.747 --> 01:14:44.587]  Wrong metaphor.
[01:14:44.927 --> 01:14:45.167]  Yes.
[01:14:45.207 --> 01:14:50.249]  Jennifer Flowers has a 12 year consensual relationship with Bill Clinton.
[01:14:50.289 --> 01:15:05.276]  Now it is true that three Arkansas State Troopers burst into the apartment of her next door neighbor Gary Johnson, an attorney, and beat him so badly they leave him for dead because he unfortunately has witnessed Bill coming and going with his own key.
[01:15:07.877 --> 01:15:22.506]  No, I urge those who understand this issue and who are engaged in this great struggle to take Alex Jones up on his challenge.
[01:15:22.666 --> 01:15:29.571]  If you can appear on television for a few seconds and clearly display the rape t-shirt
[01:15:30.511 --> 01:15:31.172]  He will pay you $1,000.
[01:15:33.253 --> 01:15:38.255]  If you can do so with a bullhorn and say Bill Clinton is a rapist, he will pay you $5,000.
[01:15:39.395 --> 01:15:44.618]  And I spoke to him earlier today, this does not have to be network television.
[01:15:44.678 --> 01:15:51.301]  If you get on television in Philadelphia or Cleveland or Detroit and we see it, then you can qualify.
[01:15:51.801 --> 01:15:53.162]  Alright, we gotta go to break, Roger.
[01:15:53.202 --> 01:15:56.885]  When we come back, we're gonna talk to Roger Stone about what's coming up on Wednesday.
[01:15:56.905 --> 01:16:01.349]  He tweeted out earlier today, on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton's campaign will be done.
[01:16:01.409 --> 01:16:02.250]  What does he mean by that?
[01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:03.351]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:16:18.803 --> 01:16:20.225]  Hillary Clinton is desperate.
[01:16:21.161 --> 01:16:29.107]  Donald Trump was 10 points ahead in the polls until Reuters and others began sampling 10 to 15 percent more Democrats in their polls to skew the numbers.
[01:16:29.408 --> 01:16:29.968]  It's incredible.
[01:16:30.268 --> 01:16:39.456]  But despite all that skewing in the last two weeks, now in major polls, put up with the very same groups, with the same methodology, Trump is neck and neck with her, or even a point or two ahead.
[01:16:39.976 --> 01:16:45.381]  But if you go look at the social media, and Breitbart and Gateway Pundit have done this, it's incredible.
[01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:55.408]  We're talking three, four, five, six times the support at places like Facebook, Livestream, Reddit, and so many other places.
[01:16:55.668 --> 01:16:59.551]  In fact, sometimes he's got ten times more likes and ten times more views.
[01:17:00.192 --> 01:17:03.975]  That's what we saw with Bernie Sanders, where he'd have 20,000 people, Hillary'd have 500.
[01:17:04.755 --> 01:17:13.402]  We did exit polls in California and other so-called battleground states in the Democratic primary, and we talked to eight people before we found one or two Hillary supporters.
[01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:17.184]  That's why Hillary was forced to steal it with the superdelegates.
[01:17:17.844 --> 01:17:19.445]  Let's look at some of the numbers themselves.
[01:17:20.366 --> 01:17:25.248]  Trump had 10 million plus likes to Clinton's 5 million on Facebook.
[01:17:25.608 --> 01:17:33.433]  And that's with Facebook admittedly censoring Trump pages everywhere they can and even meeting with Hillary Clinton just like Google does.
[01:17:34.392 --> 01:17:42.216]  Trump averages 30,000 live viewers per stream, and Clinton averages 500 live stream viewers per stream.
[01:17:42.656 --> 01:17:47.059]  On Reddit, Trump averages 197,000 plus subscribers, Hillary 24,000.
[01:17:47.539 --> 01:17:51.981]  Hillary for prison has 55,000 subscribers.
[01:17:52.241 --> 01:17:53.522]  Gee, wonder who started that.
[01:17:54.122 --> 01:17:58.124]  And this is only a snapshot of the numbers we're seeing with Trump.
[01:17:58.545 --> 01:18:02.087]  You go to YouTube, his average video has millions of views.
[01:18:03.127 --> 01:18:05.549]  You go look at Hillary's official campaign site.
[01:18:06.089 --> 01:18:08.010]  Most of her videos have 2,000 or 3,000 views.
[01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:09.531]  Her bigger one's a few hundred thousand.
[01:18:09.871 --> 01:18:11.032]  This lady's a joke.
[01:18:11.412 --> 01:18:12.753]  She's not liked by her own party.
[01:18:13.053 --> 01:18:19.737]  But we're being told it's going to be a landslide for her because they're trying to get us ready for election fraud.
[01:18:20.118 --> 01:18:23.260]  Something so well documented in this country's past.
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.482]  But Obama says it's preposterous.
[01:18:26.862 --> 01:18:28.763]  He doesn't even know what that is.
[01:18:29.563 --> 01:18:31.505]  Well, President Obama, we do know what it is.
[01:18:32.304 --> 01:18:38.187]  And this time, we don't have somebody like Mitt Romney or John McCain who's gonna stand down and not take action.
[01:18:38.507 --> 01:18:40.648]  We don't have somebody who's gonna throw in the towel there's fraud.
[01:18:40.909 --> 01:18:45.211]  We've got Donald Trump and an awake population that's aware of your scams.
[01:18:46.251 --> 01:18:47.912]  The social engineers have jumped the shark.
[01:18:48.333 --> 01:18:50.354]  They are stealing this election in front of everyone.
[01:18:51.234 --> 01:18:55.036]  By forcing them to engage in fraud, we are exposing them forever.
[01:18:55.396 --> 01:19:00.019]  So even if Donald Trump loses, even if that happens due to fraud,
[01:19:00.967 --> 01:19:01.527]  Or scandals.
[01:19:01.927 --> 01:19:10.750]  It doesn't matter because we've been in the arena, we've politically exposed the system, political correctness, globalism, the maxim has been introduced, Americanism, not globalism.
[01:19:11.530 --> 01:19:13.591]  This is a good time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:13.971 --> 01:19:20.032]  And we owe Donald Trump so much for being willing to put his family, his life, his treasure on the line.
[01:19:20.453 --> 01:19:21.693]  He is the man in the arena.
[01:19:22.273 --> 01:19:24.054]  And I'm honored to be in that arena with him as well.
[01:19:24.514 --> 01:19:29.095]  If you haven't joined us in this historic fight, it's time to pick a side right now.
[01:19:39.685 --> 01:19:41.306]  The talk show host is Alex Jones.
[01:19:41.366 --> 01:19:43.247]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[01:19:43.327 --> 01:19:46.048]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[01:19:46.249 --> 01:19:47.069]  Alex Jones.
[01:19:47.169 --> 01:19:49.911]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:19:49.971 --> 01:19:53.172]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:19:53.212 --> 01:19:54.313]  Deeply I think racist.
[01:19:54.333 --> 01:19:56.454]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[01:19:56.574 --> 01:19:58.375]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[01:19:58.395 --> 01:20:02.477]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:03.658]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:03.738 --> 01:20:08.641]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:20:12.785 --> 01:20:15.377]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:46.764 --> 01:20:48.928]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:49.428 --> 01:20:54.677]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:20:58.303 --> 01:20:58.984]  I want to be clear.
[01:21:00.137 --> 01:21:01.798]  History is happening right now.
[01:21:02.498 --> 01:21:04.079]  The globalists are in total panic.
[01:21:04.099 --> 01:21:05.100]  They admit they're in panic.
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:10.383]  Their whole corporate world government, the anti-free market that's crony-capitalist, is in retreat.
[01:21:10.783 --> 01:21:14.705]  And I'm out here with my family today, taking off the day, listening to Roger, listening to David.
[01:21:14.765 --> 01:21:21.949]  I'm doing a fabulous job, and I'm glad they're covering the fact that Bill Clinton's a known rapist who's settled cases for sexual abuse.
[01:21:21.969 --> 01:21:22.530]  It's well known.
[01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:26.732]  Roger has been the tip of the spear with his best-selling book, exposing this.
[01:21:26.792 --> 01:21:27.553]  It's documented.
[01:21:27.613 --> 01:21:28.193]  It's well known.
[01:21:28.831 --> 01:21:31.252]  But I am on the edge of my seat, as the listeners are.
[01:21:31.272 --> 01:21:33.353]  That's why I just called in and said, hey, let me take over.
[01:21:33.553 --> 01:21:34.494]  I know they said it was coming up.
[01:21:34.854 --> 01:21:44.118]  To get into WikiLeaks, because I had no idea whenever I was going to do a broadcast thing with David Knight and take the day off that I was going to be listening, that he was going to break this on our show today.
[01:21:44.559 --> 01:21:45.399]  So I'm so honored.
[01:21:45.479 --> 01:21:47.040]  And again, it may get pushed off.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:47.800]  Something may happen.
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:48.941]  There's been threats.
[01:21:49.041 --> 01:21:56.104]  Assange won't be up at the big window now doing it, you know, from the facility that he's staying at in London.
[01:21:58.006 --> 01:21:58.850]  We're good to go.
[01:22:03.453 --> 01:22:09.836]  This is such a big deal, because the fact is, he's saying something's probably going to come out on Wednesday.
[01:22:10.257 --> 01:22:14.359]  So, Roger is saying this is the quote, end of Hillary on Wednesday.
[01:22:14.519 --> 01:22:15.059]  I agree.
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:21.403]  And if the information is powerful, like all the other assigned information is powerful, the mainstream media is going to try to ignore it.
[01:22:21.863 --> 01:22:31.088]  So whatever information he's about to release from the Ecuadorian embassy, all of us, that means you the listeners, you are the power of the show, need to magnify it, need to push it, need to get it out there.
[01:22:31.828 --> 01:22:34.831]  But separately from that, then I'm going to hang up and let Roger and David take over.
[01:22:34.851 --> 01:22:36.492]  It's been a lot of time, a couple of segments on this.
[01:22:37.353 --> 01:22:40.595]  We have already seen information come out that should bring the globalists down.
[01:22:40.615 --> 01:22:41.876]  We've got to continue to put it out.
[01:22:42.557 --> 01:22:46.960]  And the good news is, no matter what they say against Donald Trump, it only seems to blow up in their face.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.362]  But history is happening.
[01:22:48.402 --> 01:22:55.587]  Just like 24 hours after I called for folks to storm national TV shows when we're out in public, it began to happen.
[01:22:55.727 --> 01:22:58.370]  If the people take action, this facade will fall.
[01:22:58.750 --> 01:22:59.751]  We're on the edge of history.
[01:23:00.316 --> 01:23:08.190]  I'm going to turn this over to both David Knight and Roger Stone right now with the videos on InfoWars.com with this big
[01:23:09.059 --> 01:23:11.961]  National movement we've launched to expose Bill Clinton's sex crimes.
[01:23:12.382 --> 01:23:16.245]  It's important for all of you listening to realize, just like the young man, we don't know his name yet.
[01:23:16.265 --> 01:23:17.666]  You need to contact us.
[01:23:18.186 --> 01:23:20.628]  Just like the young man that took action in New York is changing history.
[01:23:20.928 --> 01:23:21.969]  You are changing history.
[01:23:22.029 --> 01:23:23.410]  You literally are the power.
[01:23:23.670 --> 01:23:26.212]  That's not, that's not me complimenting you when I say that.
[01:23:26.332 --> 01:23:27.133]  You are the power.
[01:23:27.473 --> 01:23:28.234]  You are the strength.
[01:23:28.294 --> 01:23:29.154]  You are the info war.
[01:23:29.415 --> 01:23:30.355]  So gentlemen, I'm going to hang up.
[01:23:30.375 --> 01:23:33.117]  Go ahead and take over and tell us about this huge WikiLeaks info.
[01:23:33.137 --> 01:23:35.199]  I'm so honored you're doing this here on the show, Roger.
[01:23:36.969 --> 01:23:37.970]  Alex, great to be here.
[01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:44.155]  Let's wrap up our discussion of the important Clinton t-shirt project, because I must say this.
[01:23:44.875 --> 01:23:45.956]  Do not break the law.
[01:23:46.496 --> 01:23:48.678]  Do not break and enter a TV studio.
[01:23:48.758 --> 01:23:51.180]  We want you to do this in a legal way.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:24:04.510]  When the TV cameras are outside, when there's an open shot and you see it all the time at Trump rallies, particularly at Clinton rallies, at Bill Clinton's rallies, then that is the time to strike.
[01:24:05.416 --> 01:24:17.444]  Very, very soon we're going to be unveiling our next important product, the Bill Clinton Rape Whistle, which you will be able to buy at InfoWars.com or at StoneColdTruth.com.
[01:24:17.905 --> 01:24:24.589]  So if you hear that Bill Clinton is coming to town, get your Bill Clinton Rape Whistle to greet him.
[01:24:25.029 --> 01:24:31.534]  Hundreds of people blowing their rape whistles cannot be ignored by the mainstream media.
[01:24:32.418 --> 01:24:32.858]  Absolutely.
[01:24:32.878 --> 01:24:42.123]  And you know, Roger, when we look at this, I think it's important people understand, just like the Hillary for prison t-shirt, people have to understand that it's not mistakes.
[01:24:42.483 --> 01:24:43.524]  It's multiple felonies.
[01:24:43.804 --> 01:24:45.805]  That's why we have the Hillary for Clinton t-shirt.
[01:24:45.845 --> 01:24:49.306]  And you know, that's only, by the way, that's only going to go for another 30 days.
[01:24:49.346 --> 01:24:50.567]  This can become a collector's item.
[01:24:50.587 --> 01:24:52.228]  You can find that at Infowars.com.
[01:24:52.248 --> 01:25:00.232]  That supports our operation, just like the rape t-shirt supports our operation and supports this marketing campaign to get the truth out.
[01:25:00.492 --> 01:25:06.520]  Because just like it's not a mistake, it's multiple felonies, it is not consensual sex, it is multiple rapes.
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:09.564]  That's why we have the t-shirt, that's why we have the campaign.
[01:25:09.884 --> 01:25:14.931]  To drill that into people, because the mainstream media is trying to spend this constantly.
[01:25:14.951 --> 01:25:16.172]  They've been doing it for the last 25 years.
[01:25:16.753 --> 01:25:19.376]  Well I think it's first it's important David to set the table.
[01:25:19.396 --> 01:25:20.978]  As you know earlier this week
[01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:52.647]  Congressman Jerry Nadler, a left-wing, corpulent Democrat from Manhattan, called on the FBI director to open an investigation into Roger Stone and his connections to WikiLeaks.
[01:25:52.928 --> 01:25:54.048]  Yeah, McCarthyism.
[01:25:54.588 --> 01:25:56.189]  Yeah, it's the new McCarthyism.
[01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:59.010]  Joe McCarthy, Roy Cohn, Jerry Nadler.
[01:25:59.130 --> 01:26:02.272]  It's a matched set of witch hunts.
[01:26:03.314 --> 01:26:10.036]  I have been completely forthright here and in other interviews that Assange is in my view a hero.
[01:26:10.056 --> 01:26:12.997]  He does not work for the Russians.
[01:26:13.017 --> 01:26:13.938]  Let me repeat that.
[01:26:14.258 --> 01:26:16.518]  He does not work for the Russians.
[01:26:16.538 --> 01:26:18.719]  There's no evidence to the contrary.
[01:26:19.439 --> 01:26:21.220]  He is fighting the deep state.
[01:26:21.792 --> 01:26:28.435]  He has leaked documents, equally embarrassing to the Bush regime, and liberals loved him then.
[01:26:28.515 --> 01:26:37.259]  But now, you see an online effort, funded by Soros, run by the money laundering criminal David Brock, to discredit Assange.
[01:26:37.279 --> 01:26:42.241]  I actually saw a tweet saying, Oh, Assange's, whatever he releases will be fake.
[01:26:42.341 --> 01:26:45.263]  No, whatever he releases will be real.
[01:26:45.343 --> 01:26:50.485]  Now, an intermediary met with him in London recently, who is a
[01:26:51.127 --> 01:26:59.934]  Friend of mine and a friend of his, a believer in freedom, and I am assured that the motherload is coming Wednesday.
[01:26:59.954 --> 01:27:17.169]  It wouldn't be an October surprise if I told you what it was, but I have reason to believe that it is devastating because people with political judgment who are aware of the subject matter tell me this.
[01:27:17.717 --> 01:27:26.266]  So right now you see a terrible scrambling by the Clintonites to attempt to discredit Assange to try to soften the blow.
[01:27:27.007 --> 01:27:32.353]  I have said from the beginning that I believe that Mr. Assange has all of the emails
[01:27:33.408 --> 01:27:41.492]  That the Clinton henchwomen, Huma Abedin, who by the way was partying with Barbara Bush this weekend in Paris.
[01:27:41.672 --> 01:27:42.593]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:42.933 --> 01:27:43.573]  Quite a party.
[01:27:44.854 --> 01:27:49.256]  Proving that the Bushes and Clintons are together in a crime syndicate.
[01:27:49.536 --> 01:27:49.996]  That's right.
[01:27:50.316 --> 01:27:54.599]  And Cheryl Mills, they thought they destroyed all these emails.
[01:27:54.639 --> 01:27:56.419]  They thought they were deleted.
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:57.180]  Bad news.
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.062]  WikiLeaks has them all.
[01:27:59.582 --> 01:28:00.703]  It's handcuff time.
[01:28:01.064 --> 01:28:06.529]  Because herein lies the proof of the criminality of the Clintons.
[01:28:06.549 --> 01:28:13.896]  Now we've seen disinformation in the last 24 hours saying that Assange has postponed this, he's moved.
[01:28:14.517 --> 01:28:15.158]  I do know this.
[01:28:16.041 --> 01:28:18.263]  He does fear for his life, and he should.
[01:28:18.764 --> 01:28:22.728]  Right now, the globalists and the Clintonites are trying to figure out how to kill him.
[01:28:23.248 --> 01:28:34.319]  We know that a man broke into the Ecuadorian embassy and got as far as the second floor before he was detained, but it took the London police almost two hours
[01:28:35.014 --> 01:28:38.276]  to respond to the call for help.
[01:28:38.697 --> 01:28:45.302]  Even though they have a cordon around the Ecuadorian Embassy, they've spent millions of dollars to try to keep Julian Assange in prison there.
[01:28:45.582 --> 01:28:48.984]  It took them two hours to respond to this as they were notified they had a break-in.
[01:28:49.225 --> 01:28:49.565]  Stay with us.
[01:28:49.585 --> 01:28:52.987]  We're going to be right back with Roger Stone and what's coming up on Wednesday.
[01:28:53.027 --> 01:28:53.588]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:21.133]  What was it that the Attorney General said back when he was Deputy Attorney General?
[01:29:22.013 --> 01:29:22.533]  Eric Holder.
[01:29:22.593 --> 01:29:26.394]  He said we need to literally brainwash the American people against guns.
[01:29:27.014 --> 01:29:32.776]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[01:29:32.836 --> 01:29:37.457]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[01:29:37.497 --> 01:29:44.379]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:53.370]  Well, that's exactly what they've at least been able to do to a certain segment of zombie-like creatures pretending they're human.
[01:29:53.551 --> 01:30:01.020]  They have convinced them that they have no right to defend themselves and that they themselves aren't even able to stand up for their families.
[01:30:01.681 --> 01:30:10.810]  That is the true definition of slavery, where people are so disempowered, they can't even imagine that they themselves could put up any type of resistance.
[01:30:11.591 --> 01:30:19.679]  And if you won't put up a resistance to a physical attack, you won't put up resistance to the private Federal Reserve signing you onto trillions of debt that you don't owe.
[01:30:20.239 --> 01:30:25.966]  You won't put up a resistance to medical mafias that want to force GMO foods on your children and dangerous vaccines.
[01:30:26.486 --> 01:30:36.678]  You won't put up a resistance when Sharia law starts coming into the United States and they're canceling political rallies that mildly criticize Islam and its attacks on homosexuals.
[01:30:37.719 --> 01:30:39.741]  My friends, it's time to grow a spine.
[01:30:40.542 --> 01:30:46.227]  As Thomas Jefferson famously said, a nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves.
[01:30:46.768 --> 01:30:55.416]  And Rolling Stone and many other publications have come out and thrown down their stinking gauntlet, their hypocritical gauntlet, and said it's time to repeal the Second Amendment.
[01:30:55.636 --> 01:30:58.018]  They admit they want to ban guns.
[01:30:58.078 --> 01:31:00.861]  They admit they want you disarmed like New York or Chicago.
[01:31:01.121 --> 01:31:04.564]  The political class wants to dominate what they see as their property.
[01:31:05.365 --> 01:31:06.346]  Are you their property?
[01:31:07.006 --> 01:31:10.109]  Will you sit there and let their jihadis mow you and your family down?
[01:31:10.609 --> 01:31:14.353]  Or will you stand up and become self-sufficient and start defending your family?
[01:31:14.893 --> 01:31:16.014]  Really, the choice is up to you.
[01:31:16.114 --> 01:31:26.384]  The American birthright started over the attempt to confiscate our guns in Lexington and Concord in 1775, leading to July 4, 1776 and our Declaration of Independence.
[01:31:26.824 --> 01:31:29.126]  You've got to decide whether you want that birthright
[01:31:29.927 --> 01:31:31.749]  Or if you want the birthright of slaves.
[01:31:32.570 --> 01:31:33.871]  If you want to be slaves, that's great.
[01:31:34.211 --> 01:31:37.294]  May your chains set lightly upon you, to quote Patrick Henry.
[01:31:37.875 --> 01:31:40.097]  But as for me, give me liberty.
[01:31:40.838 --> 01:31:41.859]  Or give me death.
[01:31:42.499 --> 01:31:44.922]  The great battle for the Second Amendment is happening now.
[01:31:45.542 --> 01:31:47.104]  The first phase is an info war.
[01:31:47.564 --> 01:31:48.826]  And I suggest all of you
[01:31:49.326 --> 01:31:52.408]  Understand, the big assault is happening as we speak.
[01:31:53.008 --> 01:31:59.051]  The greatest attack on our freedoms that we've ever witnessed, not just the Second Amendment, is happening today.
[01:31:59.732 --> 01:32:02.113]  All good men and women must come to the aid of their country.
[01:32:02.473 --> 01:32:05.355]  And that fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:08.786 --> 01:32:13.191]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:32:13.271 --> 01:32:24.223]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[01:32:24.383 --> 01:32:29.305]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:32:29.425 --> 01:32:31.946]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[01:32:32.006 --> 01:32:33.486]  It helps detoxify.
[01:32:33.706 --> 01:32:36.547]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:32:36.587 --> 01:32:41.349]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:32:41.369 --> 01:32:47.591]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[01:32:47.631 --> 01:32:52.933]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:32:52.953 --> 01:32:53.713]  I'm taking it now.
[01:32:53.953 --> 01:32:56.154]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:28.621 --> 01:33:31.723]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:32.204 --> 01:33:36.287]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:39.386 --> 01:33:40.567]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:40.588 --> 01:33:43.310]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to Roger Stone.
[01:33:43.791 --> 01:33:50.058]  Today he mentioned that Wednesday was going to be the date for WikiLeaks to release the documents they had on Hillary Clinton.
[01:33:50.078 --> 01:33:57.186]  Remember, Julian Assange has been saying for a long time there was going to be an October surprise that was going to be very damaging to Hillary Clinton.
[01:33:57.206 --> 01:33:59.148]  It was going to be the end of Hillary Clinton.
[01:33:59.628 --> 01:34:02.389]  So much information was going to come out to expose her.
[01:34:02.749 --> 01:34:04.689]  And I get very concerned, Roger, when I see this.
[01:34:05.369 --> 01:34:10.190]  We talk all the time about the clear and present danger to Donald Trump's life when he rises in the polls.
[01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:12.551]  And, of course, we've seen other instances.
[01:34:12.611 --> 01:34:17.032]  We had Andrew Breitbart saying he had some major revelations that were going to come out.
[01:34:17.072 --> 01:34:18.472]  And the day before that happened, he died.
[01:34:18.492 --> 01:34:21.173]  I've been concerned for a very long time about Julian Assange.
[01:34:21.753 --> 01:34:51.333]  Safety is we went to the break you were talking about how there was an intruder at the Ecuadorian embassy where he's been essentially cordoned by London police they've spent millions of dollars over the years to keep him imprisoned in that embassy I know they wouldn't take two hours to respond if Julian Assange began to leave that embassy but they took more than two hours even though they're posted right outside the embassy as you can just see in that picture there even though they're posted right outside there permanently they took over two hours to respond to the fact that there was an intruder there
[01:34:51.813 --> 01:34:59.159]  So I'm very concerned about it, especially the earlier report said that Julian Assange was going to make the announcement from the balcony at the Ecuadorian Embassy.
[01:34:59.199 --> 01:35:01.441]  I mean, that sounds like a Martin Luther King moment to me.
[01:35:02.042 --> 01:35:08.607]  Yeah, I think that they should rethink that because he is more valuable to the movement alive.
[01:35:08.847 --> 01:35:09.508]  Yeah.
[01:35:09.788 --> 01:35:14.912]  And look, I don't want to overstate this because I know that my critics are watching.
[01:35:15.573 --> 01:35:16.814]  I don't control Assange.
[01:35:17.683 --> 01:35:18.504]  And nobody does.
[01:35:18.604 --> 01:35:22.427]  He is his own man and he is committed to fighting the deep state.
[01:35:23.267 --> 01:35:41.000]  And he may change his mind about what to put out and when to put it out, but my very best intelligence from a mutual friend who has spoken to him in London is that the motherlode is about to come and it will be extraordinarily damning to the Clintons.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:43.902]  That's why you see this extraordinary panic
[01:35:44.705 --> 01:35:45.146]  I don't
[01:36:01.994 --> 01:36:08.920]  Passed by Republicans and Democrats together, and paid his fair share under the law.
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:15.245]  If he didn't take the deductions, then he's too dumb to be President, and I don't want him to be President.
[01:36:15.345 --> 01:36:17.066]  That's right.
[01:36:17.387 --> 01:36:26.034]  Or he would be like Hillary Clinton, who has the legal firm where Comey and Loretta Lynch were partners at the law firm.
[01:36:26.054 --> 01:36:28.616]  They used to do the taxes for the Clintons, so they put out a nice, neat
[01:36:29.236 --> 01:36:29.937]  We're good to go.
[01:36:50.455 --> 01:36:51.816]  You want to try to minimize your taxes.
[01:36:52.076 --> 01:36:56.719]  They're not saying that he did anything illegal, but they're trying to say that it's a bad deal if he doesn't pay taxes.
[01:36:57.019 --> 01:37:04.224]  You've got people like Warren Buffett saying, oh, it's a crime that my tax rate is lower than my secretary's rate or whatever.
[01:37:04.244 --> 01:37:05.985]  Well, he could always pay more taxes!
[01:37:06.425 --> 01:37:12.148]  But that's virtue signaling from him, from Hillary Clinton, from the New York Times, even though the New York Times did the exact same thing.
[01:37:12.168 --> 01:37:14.130]  They didn't pay any taxes.
[01:37:14.890 --> 01:37:19.473]  And I don't know what they did to get... I read the statement that they put out.
[01:37:20.834 --> 01:37:22.394]  And it was very legalistic.
[01:37:22.454 --> 01:37:28.177]  I don't know what they did to get $3 million back when they had a profit of $30 million, but that's the way the New York Times plays it.
[01:37:28.197 --> 01:37:30.218]  But then they criticized Donald Trump for doing the same thing.
[01:37:30.738 --> 01:37:43.805]  Yeah, you gotta wonder whether they passed some of those tax savings on to the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, who owns a majority interest in the New York Times and who is, of course, the single largest donor to the Clinton Foundation.
[01:37:44.537 --> 01:37:45.417]  Ponzi scam.
[01:37:45.858 --> 01:37:51.720]  So, it is, look, I don't want a president who pays more than he is required to.
[01:37:52.201 --> 01:37:55.622]  This is the guy I want in charge of the Federal Treasury.
[01:37:55.982 --> 01:37:57.683]  Somebody who counts every dollar.
[01:37:57.743 --> 01:38:02.946]  Somebody who is not beholden to special interests and therefore could actually cut waste.
[01:38:03.386 --> 01:38:09.789]  If you're paying the government more than you're legally required to, as I say, you're too dumb to be President of the United States.
[01:38:10.109 --> 01:38:14.994]  Well it's an effort to try to get people to pay attention to Donald Trump's taxes and not to their own taxes.
[01:38:15.434 --> 01:38:20.239]  Donald Trump has put out the largest tax decrease that any president has ever proposed.
[01:38:20.279 --> 01:38:25.625]  Larger than Reagan's tax decreases and yet Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes on everyone.
[01:38:25.945 --> 01:38:27.086]  From the poorest to the richest.
[01:38:27.126 --> 01:38:34.895]  She brags about how she's going to put a death tax of 45 to 65 percent on people as an estate tax, a death tax.
[01:38:35.255 --> 01:38:38.699]  That's going to devastate small businesses, it's going to devastate small farms.
[01:38:39.099 --> 01:38:45.266]  They don't have the corporate lawyers to fight these kind of re-evaluations and she's going to go up on taxes for everybody.
[01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:46.587]  She's bragging about that.
[01:38:46.607 --> 01:38:50.311]  The highest tax rates we've had since Ronald Reagan came in, she wants to reinstitute.
[01:38:50.592 --> 01:38:51.813]  They don't want people to see that.
[01:38:51.833 --> 01:38:58.861]  They want people to buy into this politics of envy and get upset about the fact that Donald Trump took legal tax deductions.
[01:38:59.414 --> 01:39:03.476]  Yeah, this is what my friend Lionel calls the rodeo clown media.
[01:39:03.496 --> 01:39:07.878]  So in other words, don't look at the massive theft and corruption of the Clinton Foundation.
[01:39:08.258 --> 01:39:14.221]  Look over here at Donald Trump taking perfectly legal tax deductions over losses that he had.
[01:39:15.201 --> 01:39:16.962]  It is really pathetic.
[01:39:17.002 --> 01:39:20.484]  By the way, I think it will have very little effect.
[01:39:20.704 --> 01:39:24.806]  Now the great question about Trump's taxes has been answered.
[01:39:24.886 --> 01:39:27.787]  So, it's time for Hillary to release all the emails.
[01:39:28.513 --> 01:39:30.599]  I mean, Trump's taxes are now out there.
[01:39:30.639 --> 01:39:31.783]  We know what the riddle is.
[01:39:32.392 --> 01:39:39.294]  It's time for Hillary to have the same kind of exposure, the same kind of disclosure.
[01:39:39.314 --> 01:39:44.556]  And if she doesn't do it, I'm convinced that Mr. Assange will do so.
[01:39:44.576 --> 01:39:49.538]  You know, another place, Roger, where there's been a misdirection is on Cuba.
[01:39:50.418 --> 01:39:59.041]  Trying to get Florida, Hillary came out this last week and made some allegations that Donald Trump had tried to avoid sanctions in Cuba.
[01:39:59.881 --> 01:40:08.707]  Ignoring the fact that it's been Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration that took down the sanctions that have been there since the 1960s against Cuba.
[01:40:08.987 --> 01:40:24.318]  That's the most amazing thing to me and yet they have to do that because there's a massive Republican vote that is Cuban in Florida so it is a purely political move ignoring the hypocrisy of the felony violations that Obama just committed with the
[01:40:24.838 --> 01:40:32.783]  Cubans that I know, Cuban-Americans, my wife is a Cuban-American, her father was a diplomat under Batista who fled for his life because he was on a hit list
[01:40:52.281 --> 01:41:02.588]  And the Central Intelligence Agency informed him shortly after he was to return for indoctrination in Cuba that he should not go back to his homeland.
[01:41:02.628 --> 01:41:06.130]  He lost everything in the Cuban Revolution.
[01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:19.679]  But Cubans that I know, and I know many, know that under the embargo lifting that those who do business in Cuba cannot partner with local Cuban business people.
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:22.141]  They have to partner with the government.
[01:41:22.341 --> 01:41:22.581]  Yeah.
[01:41:22.601 --> 01:41:22.682]  Yeah.
[01:41:38.141 --> 01:41:49.206]  Robin Hoods, they are totalitarian thugs who oppress Christians, and gays, and women, and anyone who disagrees with the communist rule.
[01:41:49.546 --> 01:41:56.449]  And people are still fleeing that regime, and Cubans in Florida should be, Cuban Americans in Florida should be very upset about what you just described there.
[01:41:56.889 --> 01:42:00.951]  And yet what Hillary Clinton does, as we see over and over again, is she does this misdirection.
[01:42:01.371 --> 01:42:18.775]  She comes in and makes an allegation, false allegations about Trump or whatever, something of a very minor nature to take away the fact that they have created this situation where people, they say we've taken down the barriers and yet they've established a partnership with that authoritarian regime is what they've actually done.
[01:42:19.375 --> 01:42:23.116]  Yeah, by the way, I don't think this moves the Cuban vote an iota.
[01:42:23.516 --> 01:42:25.257]  These are very informed people.
[01:42:25.477 --> 01:42:26.557]  Yeah, I think so too.
[01:42:26.657 --> 01:42:30.798]  The older Cubans, I think, are motivated by the issue of Castro.
[01:42:31.765 --> 01:42:32.565]  in the embargo.
[01:42:32.745 --> 01:42:36.826]  The younger Cubans are not, to them, Fidel Castro.
[01:42:37.266 --> 01:42:37.746]  Who's he?
[01:42:37.826 --> 01:42:40.507]  Isn't he a funny old man with a beard and a cigar?
[01:42:41.147 --> 01:42:47.588]  Yesterday I spoke to a very respected Cuban-American Democratic pollster.
[01:42:48.129 --> 01:42:48.529]  Hang on.
[01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:49.789]  Save that until after the break.
[01:42:49.989 --> 01:42:53.850]  We're talking to Roger Stone, Stone Cold Truth, and we'll be right back.
[01:42:53.890 --> 01:42:54.270]  Stay with us.
[01:43:11.787 --> 01:43:16.070]  Americanism, not globalism will be our credo!
[01:43:18.712 --> 01:43:20.914]  Americanism, not globalism!
[01:43:24.156 --> 01:43:28.199]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
[01:43:28.499 --> 01:43:34.603]  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[01:43:34.963 --> 01:43:42.508]  They have gotten the political establishment and the media establishment to become pure, wanton henchmen of totalitarianism.
[01:43:42.828 --> 01:43:47.611]  If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better.
[01:43:48.131 --> 01:43:51.193]  I think what the Chinese have done is really smart.
[01:44:03.622 --> 01:44:05.363]  Right here in Detroit.
[01:44:05.904 --> 01:44:07.665]  It's all training us to accept less.
[01:44:08.005 --> 01:44:09.146]  Lowering expectations.
[01:44:09.366 --> 01:44:10.487]  A post-industrial world.
[01:44:10.728 --> 01:44:11.548]  A new dark age.
[01:44:11.688 --> 01:44:15.471]  That's what the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 calls for.
[01:44:15.771 --> 01:44:24.038]  When we abandoned the policy of America first, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own.
[01:44:24.438 --> 01:44:28.541]  Not a world, Winston, that gets more beautiful and more technological and stronger.
[01:44:28.821 --> 01:44:31.203]  A world that gets uglier and stupider and more stupid.
[01:44:31.563 --> 01:44:38.489]  The government should allow Hillary Clinton to become President of the United States.
[01:44:38.949 --> 01:44:40.671]  I voted for Hillary Clinton.
[01:44:40.991 --> 01:44:42.032]  Well, I voted for Hillary.
[01:44:42.292 --> 01:44:44.334]  I guess I have to since I'm working for her as well.
[01:44:44.614 --> 01:44:46.536]  You want an image of the future, Winston?
[01:44:46.736 --> 01:44:48.898]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[01:44:48.998 --> 01:44:55.383]  Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.
[01:44:55.623 --> 01:45:00.125]  Women are treated discriminated against in all of these countries she took money against.
[01:45:00.425 --> 01:45:03.906]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[01:45:03.986 --> 01:45:04.847]  They're mistreated.
[01:45:05.527 --> 01:45:06.908]  She claims to be their champion.
[01:45:07.288 --> 01:45:16.091]  Don't look at me, Weston, and see the black circles around my eyes, and see how ugly and weak I am, expressing myself and dying, and I torture people 18 hours a day, and I have a horrible life.
[01:45:16.131 --> 01:45:20.453]  That's the beauty of the satanic evil of the priest of power ripping apart humanity.
[01:45:20.593 --> 01:45:21.734]  We're here to hurt humans.
[01:45:21.894 --> 01:45:23.334]  We're here to suck your guts out!
[01:45:39.341 --> 01:45:41.222]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[01:45:41.282 --> 01:45:43.164]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[01:45:43.244 --> 01:45:45.965]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[01:45:46.166 --> 01:45:46.986]  Alex Jones.
[01:45:47.066 --> 01:45:49.828]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:45:49.888 --> 01:45:53.090]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:45:53.130 --> 01:45:54.431]  Deeply I think racist.
[01:45:54.551 --> 01:45:56.392]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[01:45:56.493 --> 01:45:58.294]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[01:45:58.314 --> 01:46:02.396]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:46:02.416 --> 01:46:03.577]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:03.637 --> 01:46:08.561]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:46:09.661 --> 01:46:12.283]  The establishment anti-Trump push continues.
[01:46:12.624 --> 01:46:13.404]  The U.N.
[01:46:13.605 --> 01:46:19.449]  tweeted for 8 million Americans abroad to stop Trump, urging them to get out and vote to defeat Trump.
[01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:20.170]  The U.N.
[01:46:20.230 --> 01:46:28.156]  quickly erased the tweet from the record, 1984 style, and made a statement saying it was a mistake and that it did not originate from the U.N.
[01:46:28.216 --> 01:46:29.838]  News Center, if you believe that.
[01:46:30.138 --> 01:46:34.982]  Now the Arizona Republic, the largest newspaper in Arizona, is backing Clinton.
[01:46:35.322 --> 01:46:37.664]  A Democrat for the first time in its history.
[01:46:37.844 --> 01:46:41.688]  The Arizona Republic is now losing subscribers and receiving death threats.
[01:46:41.948 --> 01:46:48.854]  The USA Today has made an unprecedented move and endorsed Clinton declaring Trump unfit to be president.
[01:46:49.174 --> 01:46:54.239]  So establishment politicians and establishment media are clearly against Donald Trump.
[01:46:54.479 --> 01:46:56.361]  This is the establishment against Trump.
[01:46:56.721 --> 01:46:59.562]  When will the anti-establishment Trump-bashers wake up?
[01:46:59.902 --> 01:47:02.543]  This is Owen Schroer from InfoWars.com.
[01:47:02.924 --> 01:47:05.625]  Remember to download our new app, InfoWars Live.
[01:47:13.328 --> 01:47:15.969]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:32.230 --> 01:47:35.683]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:47:36.185 --> 01:47:37.590]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:41.147 --> 01:47:44.049]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, October 2nd, 2016.
[01:47:44.189 --> 01:47:46.190]  We're real close to the election, folks.
[01:47:46.770 --> 01:47:49.031]  We're talking to Roger Stone of Stone Cold Truth.
[01:47:49.872 --> 01:48:00.017]  And on Wednesday, he's under the understanding that Julian Assange is going to release the long-promised information dump to bring down Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[01:48:00.097 --> 01:48:01.538]  So we will see what's going to happen with that.
[01:48:01.598 --> 01:48:06.801]  And Roger was just about to tell us about some insights that he had into what's going on in Florida with the Cuban vote.
[01:48:06.841 --> 01:48:08.942]  But before we do, just want to remind you,
[01:48:09.662 --> 01:48:28.195]  But these t-shirts, like this project we saw over the weekend, right away we saw somebody take up Alex Jones on this offer to pay money to people who could get on the news and get this information out that Bill Clinton is not someone who is just guilty of consensual affairs.
[01:48:28.255 --> 01:48:30.056]  No, he is guilty of multiple rapes.
[01:48:30.776 --> 01:48:32.437]  That's why we have the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[01:48:32.457 --> 01:48:34.058]  That's why we're selling it at Infowars.com.
[01:48:34.119 --> 01:48:35.840]  Also, the Hillary for Prison
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:39.621]  Get the information out that it is not mistakes with her emails.
[01:48:40.281 --> 01:48:43.262]  It is multiple felonies with her emails.
[01:48:43.942 --> 01:48:52.685]  As I've had many people, retired military, tell me, friends of mine, if they did this, what she did with her emails, if they did that, they would be in jail for life.
[01:48:52.985 --> 01:48:54.025]  Everybody understands that.
[01:48:54.105 --> 01:49:00.447]  The man at the Commander-in-Chief Forum that stood up, the veteran who stood up and confronted Hillary Clinton on that, said exactly the same thing.
[01:49:01.368 --> 01:49:02.449]  It's not mistakes.
[01:49:02.789 --> 01:49:03.709]  It's multiple felonies.
[01:49:03.729 --> 01:49:05.090]  So get that information out to people.
[01:49:05.130 --> 01:49:07.591]  Hillary for prison, you know, that's a limited edition t-shirt.
[01:49:07.611 --> 01:49:09.292]  We're going to stop it at the election.
[01:49:09.312 --> 01:49:11.053]  So you've only got about 30 days to pick that up.
[01:49:11.133 --> 01:49:14.014]  It's going to be a collector's item, available only at Infowars.com.
[01:49:14.434 --> 01:49:16.575]  Also, the Bill Clinton rape shirt, okay?
[01:49:16.875 --> 01:49:19.236]  Multiple felonies, multiple rapes.
[01:49:19.376 --> 01:49:20.617]  That's what these people are about.
[01:49:20.977 --> 01:49:26.340]  Also, to help support the operation and to support your health, we have introduced a new product.
[01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:32.724]  Biome Defense is the first time we've ever offered any probiotic products from InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:49:43.731 --> 01:49:49.554]  And as you've seen Dr. Group talk here at InfoWars.com explaining the importance of gut health.
[01:49:49.634 --> 01:49:51.936]  And we've seen this in a lot of recent
[01:49:52.696 --> 01:49:57.338]  Research that's been publicized in just the last few months that the gut is the center of your health.
[01:49:57.358 --> 01:49:58.799]  It's the center of your immune system.
[01:49:58.839 --> 01:50:04.822]  It's very important to your immunity, very important to help you fight off all kinds of disease, life-threatening disease.
[01:50:04.942 --> 01:50:07.483]  Experts agree gut health plays a huge role.
[01:50:08.143 --> 01:50:12.085]  And the normal function of your immune system is essential for your optimal health.
[01:50:12.145 --> 01:50:17.247]  Again, get Biome Defense, an ultra-strength or regular strength today at Infowarslife.com.

[01:50:24.670 --> 01:50:28.292]  That's BiomeDefense at Infowarslife.com.
[01:50:29.152 --> 01:50:32.714]  Roger, you were just talking, before we went to the break, we were talking about Cuba.
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:52.880]  And how Hillary Clinton is making a very feeble play for the Cuban vote, trying to get them upset about sanctions, implying that a third party that was tangentially, alleging that a third party that was tangentially involved with Trump had tried to do something in violation of the embargo that we had there.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.102]  Ignoring the fact, of course!
[01:50:54.782 --> 01:51:13.432]  Even if that were true, Terry McAuliffe, the governor of Virginia, the person who was the former chair of the DNC, same position that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had to cover for Hillary Clinton, he ran Bill Clinton's re-election campaign, he ran Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, he went directly himself to Cuba.
[01:51:14.325 --> 01:51:19.326]  To try to set up business deals, while the embargo was in place and was essentially thrown out.
[01:51:19.786 --> 01:51:25.228]  But she brings this up even as we see them violating the sanctions, committing felonies in Iran.
[01:51:25.248 --> 01:51:28.208]  But you had some information about the Cuban vote in Florida.
[01:51:28.228 --> 01:51:33.909]  I'm very concerned to see what's going on there, because that is a must-win state for Donald Trump as well, isn't it?
[01:51:33.929 --> 01:51:40.731]  Yeah, I don't think this makes much difference in all honesty, even though it was plastered on the front page of the Miami Herald.
[01:51:42.035 --> 01:51:51.128]  An independent consulting firm, which Trump does not have any interest in, made an exploratory trip to Cuba to look into doing business there.
[01:51:51.789 --> 01:51:54.092]  They were notably unsuccessful.
[01:51:54.781 --> 01:51:57.421]  At some point, Trump reimbursed this company.
[01:51:57.722 --> 01:51:59.002]  I really don't know why.
[01:51:59.022 --> 01:52:13.724]  So Trump never did any business in Cuba, and he may not have even understood the implications of reimbursing a consultant that he had hired to look for business opportunities around the globe.
[01:52:14.284 --> 01:52:24.006]  But a very respected Democratic consultant, pollster, pardon me, who is himself Hispanic, someone I have enormous respect for, tells me
[01:52:24.705 --> 01:52:37.352]  Uh, that Trump has reached a 34% of the vote among Hispanics, that there was no drop in just in Florida, that there was no drop in his support.
[01:52:37.652 --> 01:52:41.094]  Now Romney topped out in Florida at 28 and a half.
[01:52:41.655 --> 01:52:46.337]  So 34 would be sufficient for Trump to carry the state.
[01:52:46.517 --> 01:52:49.459]  And indeed, I think he's a couple points ahead.
[01:52:49.929 --> 01:52:55.450]  It's important to understand that the Hispanic vote in Florida is not monolithically Cuban.
[01:52:55.510 --> 01:53:06.672]  In fact, the greater portion of Hispanic voters in Florida are Puerto Ricans, Colombians, and so on, and they are habitual, traditional Democrats.
[01:53:07.413 --> 01:53:15.894]  If Trump can hold a third of the Hispanic vote, which he's getting today, that will be sufficient to carry the state.
[01:53:16.394 --> 01:53:19.035]  Now, one of the concerns I have is that the targeting
[01:53:19.841 --> 01:53:26.559]  Voiced it on the Trump campaign by the Republican National Committee is designed to help Marco Rubio get reelected.
[01:53:27.412 --> 01:53:35.978]  But does not include white union Democrats in the central and southern part of the state who are Trump supporters.
[01:53:36.438 --> 01:53:39.360]  They would probably vote Democratic down ballot.
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:55.971]  So the Trump campaign needs to understand that they're being given a Mickey and that they need to use their own targeting to reach voters who are likely to vote for Trump, not Trump and the entire Republican ticket.
[01:53:56.584 --> 01:54:04.689]  Let's talk about the steal the vote issue, because you're involved in that in terms of looking at the election, monitoring the election, looking at the tricks that are being played.
[01:54:04.729 --> 01:54:18.477]  And we just mentioned Terry McAuliffe, governor of Virginia, who has worked very hard to try to get felons the right to vote in Virginia, believing that they're going to vote for the new felon-in-chief, Hillary Clinton.
[01:54:18.997 --> 01:54:28.467]  But we've also seen, just as last week in Harrisonburg, Virginia, a small town of 50,000 people, we saw 20-plus people who were dead registering to vote.
[01:54:28.647 --> 01:54:35.374]  That only came to light because a person in this small town was looking at the names and happened to notice one of the names being a deceased judge.
[01:54:35.715 --> 01:54:36.996]  So wait a minute, this guy's dead!
[01:54:37.316 --> 01:54:41.601]  Started looking at the list in detail and found 20 dead people there.
[01:54:41.701 --> 01:54:48.209]  Of course, we're told all the time, whether it's in North Carolina or Virginia or other places, don't worry, we shouldn't have any voter ID.
[01:54:48.829 --> 01:54:51.292]  That is simply racist to have a picture ID.
[01:54:51.332 --> 01:54:54.116]  We have picture ID for everything that we do with the government.
[01:54:54.156 --> 01:55:00.864]  But talk to us about the concerns that you have for sealing the vote, what people can do to monitor this on Election Day.
[01:55:01.465 --> 01:55:05.889]  Yeah, I mean, look, you need a photo ID to get on an airplane in any airport in the United States.
[01:55:06.729 --> 01:55:07.550]  Is that racist?
[01:55:07.570 --> 01:55:08.891]  I'm not sure I understand.
[01:55:08.971 --> 01:55:14.456]  But, look, President Barack Obama tells us that voter fraud literally does not exist.
[01:55:15.248 --> 01:55:16.108]  That is absurd.
[01:55:16.289 --> 01:55:23.992]  Excellent report on Fox the other night with Brett Baer focusing on four or five people who voted in two states on the same day.
[01:55:24.312 --> 01:55:27.274]  They would vote in Indiana and then drive to Wisconsin and vote again.
[01:55:27.294 --> 01:55:33.497]  So of course it exists, but it's important to understand the distinction between voter fraud
[01:55:34.068 --> 01:55:40.912]  People not registered to vote, people voting in the place of dead people, people voting multiple times, and election rigging.
[01:55:40.972 --> 01:55:56.200]  That is the electronic manipulation of the computerized voter machines that we know Hillary did during the Democratic primaries in at least 12 states, according to an authoritative study at Stanford University.
[01:55:57.081 --> 01:55:58.582]  I think this is a great danger.
[01:55:58.642 --> 01:56:02.344]  This is why we started StopTheSteal.org.
[01:56:02.964 --> 01:56:22.013]  I asked people to go there and volunteer for our exit poll program because the only way we can ensure the integrity of this election is with scientifically conducted exit polls in certain preselected key precincts in key counties in key states where we suspect
[01:56:22.435 --> 01:56:22.555]  That
[01:56:40.655 --> 01:56:47.799]  On which Trump could challenge the legality and the outcome of this election.
[01:56:48.020 --> 01:56:51.682]  And that's very important because we've seen this happen throughout Central and South America.
[01:56:51.722 --> 01:56:54.344]  Just in Brazil, we just had the female president there impeached.
[01:56:54.904 --> 01:56:55.884]  She was very unpopular.
[01:56:55.925 --> 01:56:57.566]  She was behind 10 points in the poll.
[01:56:57.706 --> 01:57:00.047]  And then they had a lot of electronic voting machines.
[01:57:00.107 --> 01:57:08.352]  And on the day they had the election, they decided that on that particular day, they weren't going to have the organization that does exit polling participate.
[01:57:08.392 --> 01:57:09.313]  So they just took a powder.
[01:57:09.853 --> 01:57:10.953]  And she handily won.
[01:57:10.973 --> 01:57:21.376]  And we've seen this throughout Central and South America, and yet we see this company, Smartmatic, which is the largest electronic voting machine company.
[01:57:21.436 --> 01:57:24.456]  They were brought in by the GOP in Utah to run their primaries.
[01:57:25.297 --> 01:57:32.558]  Our people at the top, both Republican and Democrat in the United States, are bringing in these electronic voting machines everywhere.
[01:57:32.598 --> 01:57:34.739]  That's something that really concerns me.
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:40.402]  Interestingly, David, these companies keep quickly changing names.
[01:57:40.482 --> 01:57:51.747]  As soon as their machines are identified, so Diebold, which supplies the machines, for example, in both Florida and Ohio, they change their name to Premier Election Services.
[01:57:53.188 --> 01:57:54.208]  That's all the time we've got.
