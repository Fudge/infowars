[00:00:01.451 --> 00:00:06.884]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:06.884 --> 00:00:09.170]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.502]  Here we are, Tuesday, July 5th, 2016.
[00:00:22.502 --> 00:00:24.503]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:36.871]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, bestselling author and researcher, will be joining us to discuss the shocking developments, which really aren't too shocking when you realize how corrupt this out-of-control bureaucracy and government is, and foreign interests that have hijacked the nation.
[00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:43.134]  He'll be discussing with us what just happened about 45 minutes ago or less, and that is the FBI Director, Mr. Comey,
[00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:46.817]  Coming out and saying there will not be any indictment.
[00:00:46.817 --> 00:00:52.881]  We're also going to have Roger Stone joining us with huge breaking news and Trump information.
[00:00:52.881 --> 00:01:01.907]  And we are also going to have a roundtable discussion with Jakari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo and David Knight and myself from two of our studios here in Central Texas.
[00:01:01.907 --> 00:01:08.712]  But make no mistake, what you've seen happen is another signpost showing how deep we've gone down the rat hole.
[00:01:08.712 --> 00:01:12.875]  And this is really an arrogant declaration of independence.
[00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:16.957]  Against the rule of law.
[00:01:16.957 --> 00:01:27.743]  Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.
[00:01:29.324 --> 00:01:34.006]  Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before deciding whether to bring charges.
[00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:38.987]  There are obvious considerations like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent.
[00:01:38.987 --> 00:01:46.070]  Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person's actions and how similar situations have been handled in the past.
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:58.324]  In looking back at our investigations into the mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these families.
[00:01:58.324 --> 00:02:01.185]  General Petraeus?
[00:02:01.185 --> 00:02:03.305]  And countless other cases?
[00:02:03.305 --> 00:02:05.466]  Here's the difference.
[00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:09.707]  When Colin Powell, in 1991, 1992, right until about 93 or so, when they
[00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:17.527]  Left office, was doing this.
[00:02:17.527 --> 00:02:21.610]  Email was brand new even in the executive branch of the government.
[00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.452]  Been around for decades in scientific circles.
[00:02:24.452 --> 00:02:26.413]  But it was a new thing.
[00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:35.318]  The rules and laws were developed after that, and by the 2008-9-10s, they knew exactly what they were doing.
[00:02:35.318 --> 00:02:39.381]  That's why she was ordering them to cut the headers off of classified material.
[00:02:40.663 --> 00:02:42.624]  And she knew her servers were compromised.
[00:02:42.624 --> 00:02:45.586]  I guarantee you what this is is them selling data.
[00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:48.087]  It's a drop box.
[00:02:48.087 --> 00:02:51.509]  And then she could just plausibly say, oh, I didn't know anybody was getting in there.
[00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:56.432]  It's better than going to the park and putting the briefcase, you know, under the under the park bench.
[00:02:56.432 --> 00:03:01.155]  There's countless spies have been caught doing or leaving in their trash.
[00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:02.776]  And then the spies come by and get it.
[00:03:02.776 --> 00:03:05.738]  She can try to deny what's happened.
[00:03:05.738 --> 00:03:09.180]  And it's Lynch meeting in secret with Clinton on the plane last week.
[00:03:10.444 --> 00:03:12.945]  And things like that that really show the criminal intent.
[00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:15.266]  And there's clear charges that she's lied to federal officers.
[00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:21.770]  There's clear evidence that she has tried to deceive Congress.
[00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:31.855]  And the FBI director is clearly compromised and is clearly moving this country towards lightspeed dictatorship because the sky's the limit.
[00:03:31.855 --> 00:03:35.216]  Imagine if you're Hillary Clinton right now, what's going through your mind?
[00:03:35.216 --> 00:03:35.997]  You can get away with anything.
[00:03:37.165 --> 00:03:41.968]  Now, in an earlier part of the press conference, he built up the criminal negligence.
[00:03:41.968 --> 00:03:44.949]  He built up how horrible it was.
[00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:48.971]  And a quote, strong slap on the wrist is what CNN said.
[00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:54.174]  A strong slap on the wrist, maybe if her constituents cared.
[00:03:54.174 --> 00:03:56.195]  But they love criminality by their own party.
[00:03:56.195 --> 00:04:01.978]  They love foreign interest in the Saudis giving her a hundred million and Gulf states.
[00:04:01.978 --> 00:04:04.840]  They don't care they're throwing gays off buildings and chopping their heads off.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.841]  It's not about that.
[00:04:05.841 --> 00:04:06.381]  It's about
[00:04:08.263 --> 00:04:12.285]  Virtue signaling to each other that they're trendy and they're good and they care.
[00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:18.027]  The truth is they're a bunch of pirates that want to loot the middle class further and want more free goodies.
[00:04:18.027 --> 00:04:20.708]  And Hillary is promising her minions she will do that.
[00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:35.474]  Now, if the way Barack Obama treated black Americans, less visits to inner city areas, funding to actual programs that were helping inner city people being cut, black unemployment roughly doubling,
[00:04:38.157 --> 00:04:45.019]  And more than doubling the average unemployment growth that we saw here in the United States.
[00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:46.379]  So, it's truly sickening.
[00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:48.059]  We've got that clip coming up and a lot more.
[00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:49.460]  It's a big broadcast today.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.361]  We're also going to open the phones up so you can sound off and give us your take on the situation.
[00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:56.741]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:58.602]  Crooked Hillary above the law.
[00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:03.816]  Let's face it, most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones.
[00:05:03.816 --> 00:05:08.602]  But recent studies link cell phone use to major health issues, including brain cancer.
[00:05:08.602 --> 00:05:12.367]  Experts say parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful.
[00:05:12.367 --> 00:05:16.493]  Doctors say the infant brain, even while in the womb, is especially vulnerable.
[00:05:16.613 --> 00:05:20.916]  So keep the phone away from your abdomen, especially toward the end of pregnancy.
[00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:26.439]  And for men, using a cell phone for as little as an hour a day is literally cooking your sperm.
[00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:31.082]  Lowering sperm count levels so much that conceiving a child could be difficult.
[00:05:31.082 --> 00:05:33.324]  This is one of those times you want to keep it out of your pants.
[00:05:33.704 --> 00:05:39.167]  And for those of us who use our cell phones before bed, know that the screen light is actually disrupting your sleep rhythms.
[00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:41.828]  This causes insomnia and slows the metabolism.
[00:05:41.828 --> 00:05:43.109]  Hello, weight gain!
[00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:48.212]  Generally speaking, when cell phones are on, they're constantly emitting radio frequency radiation.
[00:05:48.212 --> 00:05:50.473]  So keep your phone in airplane mode when you can.
[00:05:50.473 --> 00:05:53.074]  Keep the phone at least two feet away from your body.
[00:05:53.074 --> 00:05:54.015]  Use headphones.
[00:05:54.015 --> 00:05:57.337]  And when you're not on your phone, keep it as far away from you as possible.
[00:05:57.337 --> 00:05:59.378]  Leigh Ann McAdoo with your InfoWars Tip of the Week.
[00:06:00.671 --> 00:06:02.112]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:03.432]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:06:03.432 --> 00:06:04.652]  Why is this so good?
[00:06:04.652 --> 00:06:09.934]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:06:09.934 --> 00:06:23.477]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:06:23.477 --> 00:06:24.838]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:27.259]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:29.841]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:31.142]  These are all parasites.
[00:06:31.142 --> 00:06:32.242]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:06:32.242 --> 00:06:33.603]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:06:33.603 --> 00:06:38.086]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:06:38.086 --> 00:06:41.248]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:06:41.308 --> 00:06:44.409]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:45.469]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:47.390]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.410]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.111]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:54.392]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:54.392 --> 00:06:56.633]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:06:56.633 --> 00:06:58.594]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:08.543]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[00:07:08.543 --> 00:07:09.743]  A 360 win.
[00:07:09.743 --> 00:07:16.326]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarshore.com.
[00:07:16.326 --> 00:07:23.830]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip, because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.911]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:35.413]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:43.195]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:07:43.195 --> 00:07:50.417]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:07:50.417 --> 00:07:51.217]  10% off on AutoShip.
[00:07:51.397 --> 00:07:53.824]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:53.824 --> 00:07:55.829]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[00:07:55.829 --> 00:07:59.659]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[00:08:15.033 --> 00:08:18.534]  Oh man, I'm angry!
[00:08:18.534 --> 00:08:33.799]  They've been running the clock on us.
[00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:39.701]  We've been hearing for a year that Comey is a tough guy and is gonna indict Hillary.
[00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:42.222]  Because after all they have to, look what they did to Petraeus for far less.
[00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:50.318]  It's not just her engaged in espionage, putting classified material on a server, and then foreign donors giving her money to her foundation.
[00:08:50.318 --> 00:08:53.558]  That's what it was, was a dropbox, in my educated research view.
[00:08:53.558 --> 00:08:59.040]  The bottom line is, she knew what she was doing, so regardless, it's espionage.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.540]  Where are the espionage charges?
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.061]  Forget violating, you know, the National Security Act or whatever.
[00:09:05.061 --> 00:09:07.842]  Forget violating a secrecy act with secret documents.
[00:09:07.842 --> 00:09:08.462]  That's bad enough.
[00:09:08.462 --> 00:09:12.023]  It's nothing compared to the willful intent of knowing you're on a compromised server.
[00:09:13.123 --> 00:09:15.704]  And then lying to the public and saying she didn't have the server.
[00:09:15.704 --> 00:09:17.385]  Or saying she didn't know it had been hacked.
[00:09:17.385 --> 00:09:19.146]  Or saying it never had been hacked.
[00:09:19.146 --> 00:09:21.587]  Just a few months ago, our reporters talked to her on the campaign trail.
[00:09:21.587 --> 00:09:27.369]  She was still saying her servers weren't hacked when everyone knew a year ago they were.
[00:09:27.369 --> 00:09:29.590]  And now the FBI directors come out and said they were hacked.
[00:09:32.227 --> 00:09:43.575]  It was very frustrating watching the press conference because he says all the horrible things she's done, or he says a lot of it, and then he just says, by the way, we're not going to indict because no reasonable prosecutor could prosecute her with this information.
[00:09:43.575 --> 00:09:45.897]  What?
[00:09:45.897 --> 00:09:57.805]  Ladies and gentlemen, the lying to federal officers, the lying to Congress, changing her story so many times, it makes my head spin.
[00:09:57.805 --> 00:09:59.146]  You have her right there.
[00:10:02.216 --> 00:10:10.801]  And then you've got her getting money from third-world dictators to then take restrictions off the State Department for technology and weapons transfers.
[00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:12.522]  That's a whole separate area.
[00:10:12.522 --> 00:10:17.285]  And the missile secrets in the 90s, the Communist Chinese, on and on and on.
[00:10:17.285 --> 00:10:18.946]  Roger Stone's coming on about it today.
[00:10:18.946 --> 00:10:27.331]  We're going to repost the top of InfoWars.com, a story he wrote for us exclusively for July 4th, that gets into reminding folks the documented
[00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:57.490]  Technology, the entire system, the miniaturization systems, the re-entry systems, the multiple warhead targeting systems, the MIRV technology, the first stage boost technology, the second stage boost technology, the re-entry technology, the GPS systems, everything, the entire shop of ICBM technology developed here in the United States.
[00:11:00.885 --> 00:11:15.849]  Second to none, the German technology we hadn't developed by the 60s is better than what the Russians have today, but all the designs were accidentally destroyed.
[00:11:15.849 --> 00:11:20.831]  To a whole group of rockets, not just the Saturn series.
[00:11:20.831 --> 00:11:25.772]  And I don't want to digress, but this is the deliberate sabotage of this country.
[00:11:27.304 --> 00:11:33.648]  By the way, the Russians have the best super heavy boosters, but in a bunch of other classes, the United States had better ones.
[00:11:33.648 --> 00:11:41.514]  And the point is, is that we have to go to Russia now to get our boosters, and then what was left of our technology was given to the Communist Chinese.
[00:11:41.514 --> 00:11:46.738]  I mean, this is just the most flagrant, over-the-top, ridiculous treason you could imagine.
[00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:48.771]  But I'm digressing.
[00:11:48.771 --> 00:11:51.553]  Today I want to talk about the crimes of Hillary Clinton.
[00:11:51.553 --> 00:11:57.518]  Because the Court of Public Opinion, they may think they're above the law and have declared independence against the people and against rule of law.
[00:11:57.518 --> 00:11:58.679]  But let me tell you something.
[00:11:58.679 --> 00:12:00.921]  You can't stop the Court of Public Opinion.
[00:12:00.921 --> 00:12:07.086]  And you can't stop the American people across the board realizing that under this globalist economic system we're being screwed over.
[00:12:07.086 --> 00:12:11.370]  And Obama was used as the leftist front to get that globalist, corporatist agenda through.
[00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.833]  And now they're going to have the ridiculous stunt of a woman
[00:12:15.433 --> 00:12:18.875]  With her female running mate, is the word.
[00:12:18.875 --> 00:12:20.736]  And that half her cabinet will be women.
[00:12:20.736 --> 00:12:26.100]  This is a total stunt gimmick.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:31.123]  Absolute, complete gimmick.
[00:12:31.123 --> 00:12:38.267]  And so we're gonna get to hear that we're against women now because we're against this crime boss, Hillary Clinton.
[00:12:38.267 --> 00:12:41.750]  And she stole the nomination openly from Bernie Sanders.
[00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:42.390]  Openly!
[00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.371]  And of course he rolled over.
[00:12:44.642 --> 00:12:56.008]  And just everything's being given to her because she is so incredibly compromised.
[00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:57.328]  And now there's new reports out.
[00:12:57.328 --> 00:13:06.533]  Huma, Hillary flouted protocol, used burn bags to destroy documents prohibited by federal regulations and laws.
[00:13:06.533 --> 00:13:13.236]  Abedin also admitted to being aware of her obligation to delete federal records or destroy federal records.
[00:13:17.133 --> 00:13:20.894]  Again, aware of her obligation not to delete federal records.
[00:13:20.894 --> 00:13:23.635]  Not to delete federal records, or restore federal records.
[00:13:23.635 --> 00:13:30.997]  So they're all admitting that they broke the law now, and saying that they were ordered to do this by Hillary, and it's like, it's okay.
[00:13:30.997 --> 00:13:36.399]  As long as you all say she ordered you to do it, she's above the law, so everybody gets a pass.
[00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:40.460]  So there's the headline, FBI recommends no charges against Clinton in email probe.
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.021]  I had Dan Bongino, senior retired Secret Service agent,
[00:13:46.032 --> 00:13:47.673]  And he's like, no, no, they're going to indict her.
[00:13:47.673 --> 00:13:48.373]  That's the word.
[00:13:48.373 --> 00:13:52.535]  No, they're not.
[00:13:52.535 --> 00:13:57.197]  Because we have the word directly from the highest levels.
[00:13:57.197 --> 00:14:03.460]  And we told you here last week that she would not be indicted with Larry Nichols and with others.
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:08.603]  And Trump, you notice, came out a day before anybody else did and said, the word is no indictment for Crooked Hillary.
[00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:17.632]  Because don't think for a minute the average FBI agent and even senior people are not completely freaked out by this.
[00:14:17.632 --> 00:14:24.153]  This woman is completely, absolutely, a total megalomaniac.
[00:14:24.153 --> 00:14:29.114]  In fact, I took an image of her today that really shows her evil and I tweeted it out at Real Alex Jones.
[00:14:29.114 --> 00:14:31.615]  At least I was getting ready to when we were about to go live.
[00:14:31.615 --> 00:14:32.295]  I asked the Don to do it.
[00:14:32.295 --> 00:14:33.335]  He's probably already done it.
[00:14:33.335 --> 00:14:35.036]  Can you guys go to my Twitter for TV viewers?
[00:14:35.036 --> 00:14:36.876]  I want to show folks the tweet I put out.
[00:14:37.975 --> 00:14:58.433]  And then I'm going to go to Trump's tweet and just read through these, and just imagine having this guy as president versus Hillary, who CNN had up there in a white outfit like she was a goddess, and then flared the iris up where she burns like a god, and they said, Golden God, this is who the power structure wants.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:08.505]  And because she will be like a god politically, when all these criminals get behind her and make her above the law, she can do anything she wants, and she said what that is.
[00:15:08.505 --> 00:15:14.929]  Start a bunch of wars, jack up taxes, come after our guns, go after better clingers, it's on.
[00:15:14.929 --> 00:15:16.570]  Let's go back to my Twitter, please.
[00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:20.813]  Real Alex Jones.
[00:15:20.813 --> 00:15:22.234]  Very evil image of Hillary.
[00:15:22.234 --> 00:15:22.794]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:15:22.794 --> 00:15:23.114]  There it is.
[00:15:23.114 --> 00:15:26.396]  Scroll back down.
[00:15:26.396 --> 00:15:26.777]  There you go.
[00:15:26.777 --> 00:15:28.017]  Look at that look on her face.
[00:15:28.017 --> 00:15:28.738]  If you're a radio listener,
[00:15:29.969 --> 00:15:31.450]  I'll go to real Alex Jones.
[00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:38.475]  By the way, it's come out that Hillary has 90-something percent fake Twitter followers, and so does Obama, and so does Michelle Obama.
[00:15:38.475 --> 00:15:40.056]  We don't have any fake followers.
[00:15:40.056 --> 00:15:41.837]  We don't want fake followers.
[00:15:41.837 --> 00:15:48.902]  I can go out and buy 10 million followers for like $20,000, and most of them aren't even real people, and then say how big I am on Twitter.
[00:15:48.902 --> 00:15:52.264]  Are 3 million people that follow us on Facebook real?
[00:15:52.264 --> 00:15:54.946]  400,000 people that follow us on Twitter, all together it's about a million?
[00:15:54.946 --> 00:15:55.186]  Real.
[00:15:56.087 --> 00:16:04.031]  But you do need to follow us there, because we were kind of late to the game getting into Twitter years ago, and it's important to be able to stay in contact with you on more platforms.
[00:16:04.031 --> 00:16:12.976]  But going back to the image that says it all, there's certainly a Ben Garrison image that says, I'm with her, the Grim Reaper, showing all the different wars she started and lied about.
[00:16:12.976 --> 00:16:17.658]  And then I see some leftists going, oh, but it was okay when George Bush did it.
[00:16:17.658 --> 00:16:19.239]  No, we were against that.
[00:16:19.239 --> 00:16:20.080]  The difference is,
[00:16:21.556 --> 00:16:39.449]  Bush didn't actually openly aid ISIS and Al-Qaeda to go in and overthrow Christian countries and our allies like Egypt, or double-cross Qaddafi and set him up, or double-cross Assad to try to put ISIS in that's, let's be conservative, 50 times worse than Assad?
[00:16:39.449 --> 00:16:41.551]  Overthrowing our 30-plus year allies?
[00:16:43.643 --> 00:16:46.684]  Who were pro-Western and had brought real stability to Egypt.
[00:16:46.684 --> 00:16:53.266]  They overthrew them and they blew up more than 300 churches and killed over 100,000 Christians.
[00:16:53.266 --> 00:16:57.207]  And the Egyptian military said, why are you backing ISIS and Al-Qaeda?
[00:16:57.207 --> 00:16:59.667]  Before it was even known as ISIS.
[00:16:59.667 --> 00:17:01.608]  That's what our government did.
[00:17:01.608 --> 00:17:03.048]  That's who Hillary's behind.
[00:17:03.048 --> 00:17:04.268]  That's who she works with.
[00:17:04.268 --> 00:17:05.209]  That's who these people are.
[00:17:05.209 --> 00:17:08.670]  They are out to get us, folks.
[00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:09.830]  They're not playing games.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.261]  They're bizarre.
[00:17:13.261 --> 00:17:16.782]  And Hillary's promising to go to the center if she gets elected.
[00:17:16.782 --> 00:17:18.302]  Bull!
[00:17:18.302 --> 00:17:19.923]  She is never going to stop.
[00:17:19.923 --> 00:17:22.964]  She is going to go for total broke once she's in office.
[00:17:22.964 --> 00:17:24.805]  And this is America's make it or break it time.
[00:17:24.805 --> 00:17:29.947]  And I'm here to tell you.
[00:17:29.947 --> 00:17:33.608]  Everybody is going to rue the day that we didn't stop Hillary Clinton.
[00:17:35.529 --> 00:17:37.530]  I don't enjoy going up against a crime boss like her.
[00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:44.533]  I don't enjoy actually mobilizing people nationwide in something that is, at my level, a very dangerous exercise.
[00:17:44.533 --> 00:17:47.515]  I'm a father of three.
[00:17:47.515 --> 00:17:51.617]  But I'm here to tell you, my children have no future in the long term if we don't turn this around.
[00:17:51.617 --> 00:17:53.038]  So I'm all in.
[00:17:53.038 --> 00:17:54.598]  And I know you're all in as well.
[00:17:54.598 --> 00:17:57.800]  And believe me, Bill Clinton looks like he's about to die any minute.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.541]  Hillary Clinton looks completely mentally ill.
[00:18:01.266 --> 00:18:07.151]  Even if she gets into office, though, I think she'll end up collapsing or going insane or something, because she's definitely mentally ill.
[00:18:07.151 --> 00:18:08.352]  She's definitely on drugs.
[00:18:08.352 --> 00:18:09.353]  She's definitely burnt out.
[00:18:09.353 --> 00:18:10.634]  So don't worry.
[00:18:10.634 --> 00:18:12.116]  God works in mysterious ways.
[00:18:12.116 --> 00:18:15.098]  We've just got to do the right thing, and God will carry us the rest of the way with Providence.
[00:18:15.098 --> 00:18:18.421]  Because there's a lot of awakening happening right now.
[00:18:18.421 --> 00:18:18.902]  And who knows?
[00:18:18.902 --> 00:18:23.345]  They may bring Hillary in, and then the global collapse happens, and world government gets in more trouble.
[00:18:23.345 --> 00:18:27.189]  Look at the British exit, and what's happening with 30 nations wanting to leave the euro right now.
[00:18:28.686 --> 00:18:33.730]  So, you know what, we just gotta move forward, do the right thing, justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:40.855]  Now, I'm gonna open the phones up, and I want first-time callers of the first round to be able to speak specifically to the non-indictment and where you think this is going.
[00:18:40.855 --> 00:18:43.377]  You think there'll be talk of other indictments?
[00:18:43.377 --> 00:18:46.059]  I think this shows the sky's the limit for the establishment.
[00:18:46.059 --> 00:18:50.502]  I think this shows a blank check, a declaration of independence against due process, but I wanna know
[00:18:51.303 --> 00:18:53.605]  And a declaration of independence against justice.
[00:18:53.605 --> 00:18:57.969]  And a declaration of independence by the criminals on July 4th against the American people.
[00:18:57.969 --> 00:18:58.789]  That's what this is all about.
[00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:59.290]  800-259-9231.
[00:18:59.290 --> 00:18:59.510]  800-259-9231.
[00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:04.614]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:19:04.614 --> 00:19:09.258]  What do you think the next shoot-a-drop will be?
[00:19:09.258 --> 00:19:11.200]  Well, let's go out to break with Crooked Hillary.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.322]  This is the FBI Director.
[00:19:13.322 --> 00:19:14.342]  Recommends no charges.
[00:19:14.342 --> 00:19:14.643]  Here it is.
[00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:28.539]  Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.
[00:19:28.539 --> 00:19:33.221]  Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before deciding whether to bring charges.
[00:19:33.221 --> 00:19:38.202]  There are obvious considerations like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent.
[00:19:38.202 --> 00:19:45.325]  Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person's actions and how similar situations have been handled in the past.
[00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:48.954]  In similar situations, they've indicted people.
[00:19:48.954 --> 00:19:58.151]  And what you have done here, a little bit of a Freudian slip there, is they set a precedent now where prosecutors are going to say, oh, you got thousands of documents foreign governments are accessing, every one of them's a felony.
[00:19:58.151 --> 00:19:58.652]  That's okay.
[00:20:00.803 --> 00:20:04.644]  Right now at DeseretFoodStore.com, get a free one-year supply of food.
[00:20:04.644 --> 00:20:08.085]  That's right, a free one-year supply of storable foods.

[00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:22.409]  Again, that's 801-444-1444.
[00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:35.033]  The best-kept secret in the firearms business is CDNNsports.com.
[00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:39.255]  CDNN Sports is the largest firearms liquidator in the U.S.

[00:21:00.224 --> 00:21:08.366]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[00:21:08.366 --> 00:21:09.186]  Here's why.
[00:21:09.186 --> 00:21:13.327]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[00:21:13.327 --> 00:21:14.247]  So please listen.
[00:21:14.247 --> 00:21:17.928]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[00:21:17.928 --> 00:21:24.289]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:28.350]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.551]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[00:21:31.551 --> 00:21:33.891]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[00:21:33.891 --> 00:21:38.712]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[00:21:38.712 --> 00:21:45.434]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[00:21:45.434 --> 00:21:47.174]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[00:21:47.174 --> 00:21:48.855]  Go to gridwars.com.
[00:21:48.855 --> 00:21:50.575]  That's gridwars.com.
[00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:54.436]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[00:21:54.436 --> 00:21:55.997]  Go to gridwars.com.
[00:21:55.997 --> 00:21:57.337]  That's gridwars.com.
[00:21:59.636 --> 00:22:00.736]  Think about this.
[00:22:00.736 --> 00:22:13.319]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[00:22:13.319 --> 00:22:17.560]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:22.422]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Perky Lab.
[00:22:22.422 --> 00:22:23.422]  EPA certified lab.

[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.221]  Are you worried about how dangerous the world has become?
[00:23:02.221 --> 00:23:09.483]  In these days of terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or even a future collapse, you need to be medically prepared to keep your family safe.
[00:23:09.483 --> 00:23:18.706]  I'm Joe Alton, MD of store.doomandbloom.net, where you'll find an entire line of uniquely designed medical kits and supplies for when help is not on the way.

[00:23:27.969 --> 00:23:29.009]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:23:29.423 --> 00:23:37.527]  There is an affordable alternative to the high cost of health care that offers freedom from insurance while providing compliance with the Obamacare individual mandate.
[00:23:37.527 --> 00:23:43.770]  Imagine having access to quality, affordable health care that allows you the freedom to choose your doctor and hospital.
[00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:49.393]  Members can share up to 100% of necessary medical expenses, including some alternative treatments.
[00:23:49.393 --> 00:23:54.336]  Find out how you and your family can contain health care costs without giving up your freedom.
[00:23:54.336 --> 00:23:56.577]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:23:56.577 --> 00:23:58.438]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:16.042]  So the world really is divided into two different groups of people.
[00:24:16.042 --> 00:24:18.483]  Those that are informed and those that are uninformed.
[00:24:18.483 --> 00:24:22.806]  And there are some people that are informed that are trying to build a free, open society.
[00:24:22.806 --> 00:24:31.070]  There are other people that are informed that are feeding on the groups that are not aware of what's happening.
[00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:40.055]  And it is the arrogance, it is the fact that so many ignorant people are willfully ignorant and like to be ignorant
[00:24:41.246 --> 00:24:42.887]  That really is our downfall overall.
[00:24:42.887 --> 00:24:51.774]  And there's videos up on InfoWars.com where the majority of Americans out on the street in California think the United States is 2016 years old.
[00:24:51.774 --> 00:24:59.320]  They believe that years go forward from that point, not the birth and death of Christ.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:05.265]  We have videos, 4th of July, where people don't know how many stars are on the American flag and they don't know why.
[00:25:05.265 --> 00:25:10.429]  And they don't know why they celebrate it.
[00:25:12.598 --> 00:25:20.983]  And understand something, we don't put these videos out with our correspondent Mark Dice at InfoWars.com because we want to feel elitist about this.
[00:25:20.983 --> 00:25:23.364]  Drudge doesn't link to them because of that.
[00:25:23.364 --> 00:25:29.148]  It's not, oh look at these morons, let's laugh at them like jaywalking and celebrating the ignorance.
[00:25:29.148 --> 00:25:30.889]  I don't even think Jay Leno was celebrating the ignorance.
[00:25:30.889 --> 00:25:34.851]  He was pointing out how scary, in fact he said that before, it was they were so stupid.
[00:25:34.851 --> 00:25:38.173]  And that's who Hillary is pitching things to.
[00:25:38.173 --> 00:25:39.674]  Saying don't be racist, vote for me.
[00:25:42.073 --> 00:25:45.417]  Do you have any idea how racist Hillary Clinton is against the human race?
[00:25:45.417 --> 00:25:47.819]  She's a psychopath.
[00:25:47.819 --> 00:25:50.102]  That means you're the opposite of a philanthropist.
[00:25:50.102 --> 00:25:54.026]  A philanthropist in its base term means a fan of humanity.
[00:25:57.335 --> 00:26:00.458]  The globalists are not fans of humanity.
[00:26:00.458 --> 00:26:01.699]  And Hillary is not a fan.
[00:26:01.699 --> 00:26:05.683]  But she virtue signals all day long and tells you she's a fan.
[00:26:05.683 --> 00:26:07.265]  But look at her charitable records.
[00:26:07.265 --> 00:26:08.526]  They're almost zero.
[00:26:08.526 --> 00:26:10.268]  Joe Biden's, Obama.
[00:26:10.268 --> 00:26:13.571]  Look at the studies from Europe, Canada, the US, Australia.
[00:26:13.571 --> 00:26:19.577]  Leftist are the most stingy, hateful people you will ever find.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:34.248]  Because they're criminal minds, they're mentally ill, they want to be in charge and they want you to think that they're virtuous like you are and that they're so virtuous you should be guilty and then humbly follow their orders.
[00:26:34.248 --> 00:26:36.909]  They're bullies.
[00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:47.996]  I was talking to a doctor of psychology yesterday who got out of it because it's so corrupt.
[00:26:49.246 --> 00:26:52.827]  And he was already successful in other businesses.
[00:26:52.827 --> 00:27:02.769]  And he just said, no, it's totally now claiming someone's been a bully, so you can reverse roles and be a bully against them, but feel good about yourself.
[00:27:02.769 --> 00:27:04.449]  And that's what they did.
[00:27:04.449 --> 00:27:15.911]  And that's why Trump being aggressive and confident in these criminals' faces is the only way to go, because we need confidence in this country and this world to stand up against the thugs.
[00:27:17.762 --> 00:27:23.325]  And if you don't know that in Europe and the United States and other areas, the left are a bunch of thugs.
[00:27:23.325 --> 00:27:32.729]  Absolutely there's right-wing thugs and right-wing corruption because the same globalists are manipulating both political systems towards the same authoritarian end.
[00:27:32.729 --> 00:27:43.255]  It's just with the left, they're able to go so incredibly far because it's a cult.
[00:27:44.369 --> 00:27:53.595]  The constituents of the mindset just lazily want to feel good about themselves, decide they're the good guys, and everybody else outside of that is the bad guys.
[00:27:53.595 --> 00:28:00.079]  They're the most insular, believe-what-they-want-to-believe, ignorant group of people you can imagine.
[00:28:00.079 --> 00:28:01.920]  I mean, I really try to disprove my ideas.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:07.463]  I really try to talk to other groups, and I really try to understand things, and I really am open-minded.
[00:28:07.463 --> 00:28:09.264]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:28:09.264 --> 00:28:10.585]  I'm a real liberal.
[00:28:10.585 --> 00:28:12.066]  And I'm very offended
[00:28:14.363 --> 00:28:17.905]  By the modern fascistic left, I really am.
[00:28:17.905 --> 00:28:21.826]  And I just wonder how bad it's going to get in the next administration, because I thought Bush was bad.
[00:28:21.826 --> 00:28:22.607]  Boy, I thought he was bad.
[00:28:22.607 --> 00:28:36.553]  And then every real liberal out there, whether it be somebody like, again, Jonathan Turley, constitutional lawyer, or whether it be somebody like Kabil Paglia, I mean, countless others say, oh no, you know, they have the Green Party.
[00:28:36.553 --> 00:28:43.536]  Oh yeah, Obama's three to ten times, depending on who you hear from, three to ten times worse than Bush.
[00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.211]  And I have metrics and studies showing this, you know.
[00:28:47.211 --> 00:28:50.333]  Turley said it was three times worse like five, six years ago.
[00:28:50.333 --> 00:28:51.933]  Three times worse!
[00:28:51.933 --> 00:28:54.495]  That's a conservative estimate.
[00:28:54.495 --> 00:29:05.420]  Three times worse against the press, and against whistleblowers, and against the economy, and crony deals, and big corporations giving money, and then the government shuts down their competition as the country falls apart.
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:06.540]  I'm gonna go to break.
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.501]  I'm gonna come back and play.
[00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:14.416]  The clip where the FBI director goes through all the bad things Hillary did, but said there's no evidence.
[00:29:14.416 --> 00:29:16.680]  Play a few other clips talking about how her server was hacked.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.103]  And then we're going to go right to your phone calls.
[00:29:19.103 --> 00:29:23.349]  Jerry, Nick, Brady, Robert, Kenneth, and many others, toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:29:23.349 --> 00:29:23.569]  By the way,
[00:29:27.998 --> 00:29:32.862]  People see the urgency, they understand what's going on, and they respond, and so thank you for the support.
[00:29:32.862 --> 00:29:35.243]  Thank you for supporting yourselves.
[00:29:35.243 --> 00:29:46.792]  Big success with the July 4th mega-sale on all the different preparedness items, from storable foods, to survival shield, X2, nascent iodine, to heirloom seeds, to water filtrations, you name it, 20-40% off.
[00:29:46.792 --> 00:29:48.813]  I'm extending that right through the week.
[00:29:48.813 --> 00:29:49.654]  The Independence Sale.
[00:29:49.654 --> 00:29:50.915]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.915 --> 00:29:52.356]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.356 --> 00:29:53.457]  InfoWareStore.com.
[00:29:53.457 --> 00:29:56.139]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.842 --> 00:30:05.906]  The demand for pain-ray weapons grows over fears of civil unrest.
[00:30:05.906 --> 00:30:17.755]  According to a new research study, the market for directed-energy weapons is expected to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period thanks for their use in controlling riots and cross-border trespassing.
[00:30:17.755 --> 00:30:22.338]  The global riot control system market is estimated to grow from $9 billion in 2016 to $11.78 billion by 2021.
[00:30:27.162 --> 00:30:41.109]  As a result of increasing political disputes and civil unrest, militarization of law enforcement agencies, stringent environmental and governmental regulations, and declining defense budgets of developed economies, states the report.
[00:30:41.109 --> 00:30:52.215]  So-called pain rays, or active denial systems, work by blasting controlled microwaves into a crowd of people, creating an unbearably hot sensation that forces them to flee the scene.
[00:30:52.215 --> 00:30:55.957]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:31:00.217 --> 00:31:08.384]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[00:31:08.384 --> 00:31:09.205]  Here's why.
[00:31:09.205 --> 00:31:13.348]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[00:31:13.348 --> 00:31:14.269]  So please listen.
[00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:17.992]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[00:31:17.992 --> 00:31:24.358]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[00:31:24.358 --> 00:31:26.680]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts,
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.721]  Intensifying civil unrest.
[00:31:28.721 --> 00:31:31.642]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[00:31:31.642 --> 00:31:34.004]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[00:31:34.004 --> 00:31:38.846]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[00:31:38.846 --> 00:31:45.569]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.

[00:33:19.452 --> 00:33:21.753]  Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Africa.
[00:33:21.753 --> 00:33:26.575]  They all got hit by ISIS this weekend.
[00:33:26.575 --> 00:33:29.196]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:29.196 --> 00:33:36.979]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:33:36.979 --> 00:33:42.141]  And nowhere in the news did they say that it was Islamic terror.
[00:33:42.141 --> 00:33:45.302]  Most places didn't even say ISIS.
[00:33:45.302 --> 00:33:47.963]  They report that Istanbul, formerly Constantinople,
[00:33:51.837 --> 00:33:55.860]  Basically has no tourists there now.
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.681]  And no one ever says it's Islam.
[00:33:57.681 --> 00:34:02.865]  It's Islam on a giant jihad march worldwide.
[00:34:02.865 --> 00:34:07.169]  When you look at what's happening in Europe, I've got stacks of news articles here.
[00:34:07.169 --> 00:34:14.414]  Mainstream news where they admit multi-thousand percent increases in rapes in Germany, Sweden, France and other areas.
[00:34:14.414 --> 00:34:19.078]  And the police on record are ordered to cover up that it's Islamic.
[00:34:22.228 --> 00:34:23.789]  Almost all of it.
[00:34:23.789 --> 00:34:35.412]  Then they have Swedish ministers come out, I have an article here, and say it's the fault of the Swedes that when the Muslims do it, it's not really a big deal.
[00:34:35.412 --> 00:34:39.634]  It's bad when Swedes do it, even though Swedes basically don't rape.
[00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:42.971]  Leftist politician.
[00:34:42.971 --> 00:34:46.653]  It's worse when Swedish men rape women than when migrants do.
[00:34:46.653 --> 00:34:48.515]  See, that's the upside-down world.
[00:34:48.515 --> 00:34:53.358]  Where, oh, we have a multi-thousand percent rape epidemic, the capital of rape now, in Europe.
[00:34:53.358 --> 00:34:54.899]  Oh, let's just blame the Swedes.
[00:34:54.899 --> 00:34:58.762]  Remember the Green Party came out and blamed German women?
[00:34:58.762 --> 00:35:02.845]  And the mayor of Cologne blamed the German women?
[00:35:02.845 --> 00:35:04.686]  Well, you shouldn't look so sexy, sweetheart.
[00:35:08.226 --> 00:35:16.529]  Swedish women now, the police hand out bracelets that say in Swedish, don't touch me.
[00:35:16.529 --> 00:35:21.211]  You can't make this stuff up.
[00:35:21.211 --> 00:35:34.636]  And they are, oh, in the Idaho case of the little girl that supposedly got sexually assaulted, the police have come out basically under order from the city council and said, well, we were told to keep all this secret, but there was an assault.
[00:35:34.636 --> 00:35:36.577]  It was sexual, but it wasn't rape.
[00:35:38.151 --> 00:35:43.577]  And there were three teenagers involved, or led by one teenager.
[00:35:43.577 --> 00:35:57.451]  And most of it's true, but the Washington Post said Infowars is discredited because we linked to a story that basically turned out to be accurate.
[00:36:01.681 --> 00:36:02.921]  Idaho refugee rape.
[00:36:02.921 --> 00:36:06.802]  Obama justice official threatens Americans who criticize migrant programs.
[00:36:06.802 --> 00:36:10.003]  Yeah, they're now saying it's hate speech to say that a lot of these folks are rapists.
[00:36:10.003 --> 00:36:10.824]  That's the culture.
[00:36:10.824 --> 00:36:14.425]  Unintended woman is fair game.
[00:36:14.425 --> 00:36:18.086]  And if a woman can be raped, then they get charged with the rape, not the man.
[00:36:18.086 --> 00:36:21.066]  This is the upside down sicko world.
[00:36:21.066 --> 00:36:30.349]  And they have the Washington Post and others over the weekend, countless articles saying that we are the, that we created the story.
[00:36:31.673 --> 00:36:38.175]  And that we were wrong, but then when you read the article it admits that we were right, but we didn't create the story.
[00:36:38.175 --> 00:36:43.537]  20 girls molested in new Cologne-style attacks in Swedish Rockfest.
[00:36:43.537 --> 00:36:48.218]  That's a new one from Friday, that's RT reporting that.
[00:36:48.218 --> 00:36:52.380]  They'll probably have the Washington Post say it's my fault too.
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.401]  They'll just say it's not true when it is, and then say I said it when I didn't.
[00:36:59.511 --> 00:37:04.535]  I'm looking at Drudge, Syrian refugee, right little girl at Knife Point, Idaho, all false.
[00:37:04.535 --> 00:37:05.696]  That's the police chief.
[00:37:05.696 --> 00:37:14.624]  Then it goes into blaming Drudge, goes into blaming Infowars, because they go, oh, they were from Iraq and Sudan.
[00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:22.071]  But that's what they call all the refugees now is Syrian.
[00:37:22.071 --> 00:37:24.192]  They are refugees.
[00:37:24.192 --> 00:37:25.933]  They were brought in.
[00:37:25.933 --> 00:37:28.034]  They were brought in by the feds.
[00:37:28.034 --> 00:37:29.614]  And then you call them Syrian.
[00:37:29.614 --> 00:37:34.196]  We're the ones that explain that almost none of them are Syrian.
[00:37:34.196 --> 00:37:38.737]  They've been letting less than 1% Christians in.
[00:37:38.737 --> 00:37:40.978]  When Syria is 20% Christian.
[00:37:40.978 --> 00:37:45.280]  Now there's a new statistics out that well some of the newer groups 3% they're letting in because of pressure.
[00:37:48.049 --> 00:37:49.170]  So see, that's how the media works.
[00:37:49.170 --> 00:38:08.160]  They put the lies out, we expose them, they double back to their own lies, like a dog going to its vomit, and then say that we're wrong because they're refugees, Muslim refugees, from North Africa, Northeast Africa, and Iraq.
[00:38:09.389 --> 00:38:23.114]  That's why they got jihadis of every color and shape and white, black, Asian, Arab, pouring into Syria because it was a partially industrialized nation with a lot of farms, a lot of production, a lot of good people.
[00:38:23.114 --> 00:38:24.934]  There's obviously a lot of Christians there.
[00:38:24.934 --> 00:38:26.755]  It's mainly a crypto nation.
[00:38:26.755 --> 00:38:30.796]  Crypto-Christian, you know, they claim it's 20-something percent, but it's more like 50% was really Christian.
[00:38:30.796 --> 00:38:35.398]  They've been secretly operating as Christians while the country's been more prosperous.
[00:38:35.398 --> 00:38:38.579]  Everyone's out there running around killing each other for fun because they want to steal their property.
[00:38:39.989 --> 00:38:45.411]  And so now it is a burgeoning, growing country until this whole invasion began.
[00:38:45.411 --> 00:38:49.532]  And then now that the Syrians have been beating them, they got out of the jahadis, can't go back to their home countries.
[00:38:49.532 --> 00:38:50.933]  Saudi Arabia won't take them.
[00:38:50.933 --> 00:38:55.535]  Sudan won't take them.
[00:38:55.535 --> 00:38:57.215]  No.
[00:38:57.215 --> 00:39:00.596]  So they go through Turkey and Irgun and come to Europe.
[00:39:00.596 --> 00:39:02.117]  But I'm going to stop there and go to your phone calls.
[00:39:03.939 --> 00:39:08.365]  Vermont town debates welcome for 100 Syrians as Trump pushes ban.
[00:39:08.365 --> 00:39:09.407]  And by the way, that's Bloomberg.
[00:39:09.407 --> 00:39:12.331]  When you hear there's 100 coming to your town, 10 times that.
[00:39:12.331 --> 00:39:14.554]  That's been the metric in Europe in here.
[00:39:14.554 --> 00:39:16.216]  I'm explaining this very, very slowly.
[00:39:16.216 --> 00:39:19.541]  They also claim that we claim in the Washington Post that the numbers are much higher.
[00:39:21.104 --> 00:39:25.689]  They did the same thing in Europe, where they'd say it was 100,000 a year, where it was over a million a year.
[00:39:25.689 --> 00:39:32.016]  And Obama claims it's under 100,000, when ladies and gentlemen, it's tens of thousands in Austin, Texas alone.
[00:39:32.016 --> 00:39:36.140]  Hundreds per school.
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:36.541]  This year.
[00:39:38.783 --> 00:39:45.465]  Over 230 in one year to the high school I graduated from in Northwest Hills, a smaller high school.
[00:39:45.465 --> 00:39:46.465]  I called other high schools.
[00:39:46.465 --> 00:39:47.966]  So did my other reporters.
[00:39:47.966 --> 00:39:52.387]  Every high school is jam-packed with Syrian refugees.
[00:39:52.387 --> 00:39:56.769]  They're not Syrians, most of them.
[00:39:56.769 --> 00:39:58.349]  And most of the refugees aren't children.
[00:39:58.349 --> 00:40:00.010]  Most of them are military-age men.
[00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:00.990]  So in my high school,
[00:40:02.119 --> 00:40:08.503]  Of something like 1,500 students, just added almost 232, I think.
[00:40:08.503 --> 00:40:09.584]  They just added that.
[00:40:09.584 --> 00:40:12.606]  Imagine how big these numbers are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:12.606 --> 00:40:16.328]  I mean, the numbers are staggering.
[00:40:16.328 --> 00:40:19.770]  And our government, I don't mean to digress into this, has got our borders wide open.
[00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:29.376]  We have seen terror attacks in Africa, in the Middle East, in Asia, in Central Asia, killing close to 1,000 people since last Friday.
[00:40:31.758 --> 00:40:37.942]  And you don't hear anything except, oh, we're going to take more of your rights away and have more airport security and crack Americans.
[00:40:37.942 --> 00:40:40.364]  How about you just don't bring more of these people in?
[00:40:40.364 --> 00:40:42.846]  They don't live with each other in peace.
[00:40:42.846 --> 00:40:46.408]  It's not like we're bringing in Iraqi physicist professors.
[00:40:46.408 --> 00:40:51.472]  It's not like we're bringing in, you know, a Persian scientist or something.
[00:40:52.844 --> 00:40:55.986]  To go to our universities or to be professors.
[00:40:55.986 --> 00:41:01.148]  Sure, you can bring folks over that are leaving that and don't want to be part of it and have denounced it.
[00:41:01.148 --> 00:41:07.872]  Bring the Christians, bring the real political dissidents, bring the Muslim heretics in who don't want to be under radical Islam.
[00:41:07.872 --> 00:41:10.493]  Bring reformers in.
[00:41:10.493 --> 00:41:14.496]  But do not bring the foaming at the mouth loons.
[00:41:14.496 --> 00:41:20.399]  There's a new video today on Infowars.com of two visually impaired people trying to get a cab and
[00:41:21.721 --> 00:41:22.982]  They won't let them in.
[00:41:22.982 --> 00:41:26.204]  And if you live in London, most of the cab drivers now are Muslim.
[00:41:26.204 --> 00:41:27.324]  And they work in these groups.
[00:41:27.324 --> 00:41:31.207]  I experienced it last time I was in England, where they wouldn't take us to the airport that was three miles away.
[00:41:31.207 --> 00:41:36.369]  And I went down the cab queue of like 20 Muslims, and none of them would take me.
[00:41:36.369 --> 00:41:39.551]  And then a British old guy pulls up and he goes, he goes, yeah, they do that.
[00:41:39.551 --> 00:41:41.292]  They all work together.
[00:41:41.292 --> 00:41:43.754]  And you can't say anything or you get called racist.
[00:41:43.754 --> 00:41:49.077]  And they were demanding 50 pounds to take me like three miles to the Hyatt.
[00:41:50.506 --> 00:41:51.787]  And we're just refusing.
[00:41:51.787 --> 00:41:56.569]  They said, no, we only go to London.
[00:41:56.569 --> 00:41:58.249]  And they just hated us so much.
[00:41:58.249 --> 00:42:05.173]  And we just, and finally, after I sat there and I even got it on video and everyone put it out, I finally, a British guy pulls up and he goes, no, they're not supposed to do that.
[00:42:05.173 --> 00:42:05.893]  You know, it's the law.
[00:42:05.893 --> 00:42:07.914]  They're supposed to take you wherever you want.
[00:42:07.914 --> 00:42:10.855]  That's why they pull up here at the airport, but they gouge everybody.
[00:42:10.855 --> 00:42:12.316]  He goes, where are you going?
[00:42:12.316 --> 00:42:13.496]  And I said, the highest three miles away.
[00:42:13.496 --> 00:42:14.657]  And he goes, that'll be six pounds.
[00:42:16.448 --> 00:42:17.828]  That's like $10.
[00:42:17.828 --> 00:42:23.430]  I got in, gave the guy a tip of like 10 extra pounds, and he apologizes.
[00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:30.112]  An old guy unloading our bags out, and he goes, it's kind of sad, you know, but it just gets worse.
[00:42:30.112 --> 00:42:33.793]  But I'll try to say something about it, but they sure give everybody a hard time.
[00:42:33.793 --> 00:42:35.594]  It's not like things used to be here in England.
[00:42:37.854 --> 00:42:42.517]  One old English guy, folks, gave me the service and drove me, because that's how he wants to be treated.
[00:42:42.517 --> 00:42:44.198]  He don't want to be there and screwed over.
[00:42:44.198 --> 00:42:45.339]  But I know I'm a caffer.
[00:42:45.339 --> 00:42:46.720]  I know I'm an outsider.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.060]  I'm a nobody.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.061]  I'm a subhuman.
[00:42:49.061 --> 00:42:54.044]  I deserve to pay you 50 pounds to go three miles.
[00:42:54.044 --> 00:42:56.025]  What is that, overcharging me 10 times?
[00:42:56.025 --> 00:43:05.351]  I deserve to be charged 10 times over by guys wearing freaking pajamas.
[00:43:05.351 --> 00:43:06.452]  Because I'm a white guy.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:10.524]  But I saw him doing it to Asians, other people.
[00:43:10.524 --> 00:43:13.008]  If you weren't a Muslim, you were a dumbass.
[00:43:13.008 --> 00:43:16.134]  And they were all gonna sit there and screw you over together.
[00:43:21.397 --> 00:43:26.920]  And I've talked to Joe Biggs and others that have been in heavy combat all over, and they say the Muslims weren't like that even in Iraqi places.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.601]  It's who they're bringing in, folks.
[00:43:28.601 --> 00:43:36.646]  They're bringing in vetting, just like the father-in-law or the brother-in-law of the guy at the nightclub, at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.
[00:43:36.646 --> 00:43:38.787]  He's running a major refugee operation.
[00:43:38.787 --> 00:43:40.168]  His dad went to the White House.
[00:43:40.168 --> 00:43:41.249]  All this stuff.
[00:43:41.249 --> 00:43:43.690]  They're bringing jihadis in.
[00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:45.091]  That's why they act like this.
[00:43:45.091 --> 00:43:46.332]  And I'll tell you, it is giving.
[00:43:46.732 --> 00:43:47.973]  Because I've talked to the experts.
[00:43:47.973 --> 00:43:49.933]  It's giving regular Muslims a bad name.
[00:43:49.933 --> 00:43:55.235]  You can argue all Islam is radical, its orthodox version is like this, but this is who Hillary's bringing in.
[00:43:55.235 --> 00:43:56.756]  This is who she's allied with.
[00:43:56.756 --> 00:43:57.736]  This is what she's up to.
[00:43:57.736 --> 00:43:58.597]  And I'm going to go to your calls.
[00:43:58.597 --> 00:44:00.237]  I apologize.
[00:44:00.237 --> 00:44:02.899]  Let me play the coming clip because I talked about it.
[00:44:02.899 --> 00:44:05.220]  I already played the clip where he says no charges for her.
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:06.860]  We should probably play that just one more time.
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:07.921]  It's about 20 seconds long.
[00:44:07.921 --> 00:44:13.383]  Then I'm going to play FBI director gets into criminal neglect, but then
[00:44:14.502 --> 00:44:17.004]  Turns around, though, and says no prosecutor would go after her.
[00:44:17.004 --> 00:44:18.906]  That is the biggest lie I've ever seen.
[00:44:18.906 --> 00:44:20.807]  Here's the No Indictment Clip.
[00:44:20.807 --> 00:44:31.617]  Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:37.862]  Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before deciding whether to bring charges.
[00:44:37.862 --> 00:44:42.844]  There are obvious considerations like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent.
[00:44:42.844 --> 00:44:51.528]  Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person's actions and how similar situations have been handled in the past.
[00:44:51.528 --> 00:45:02.333]  In looking back at our investigations into the mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts.
[00:45:03.137 --> 00:45:05.519]  Wow, that sets an incredible precedent right there.
[00:45:05.519 --> 00:45:08.282]  Total Declaration of Independence that they're above the law.
[00:45:08.282 --> 00:45:09.243]  Let's go to the next clip.
[00:45:09.243 --> 00:45:12.346]  It's about two minutes long, and I'm going right to Jerry and others.
[00:45:12.346 --> 00:45:14.668]  This is where he lays out, though, what she did.
[00:45:14.668 --> 00:45:18.372]  It's far worse than this, but let me tell you, this is not criminal neglect.
[00:45:18.372 --> 00:45:23.256]  This is conscious, lying to Congress, lying to the FBI, cutting the tops off the secret.
[00:45:24.577 --> 00:45:27.019]  Documents, ordering her staff to engage in crimes.
[00:45:27.019 --> 00:45:28.580]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:34.383]  This is like the cops pull up the bank and the bank robbers are walking out with the bags of money in their hands.
[00:45:34.383 --> 00:45:37.305]  And there's surveillance footage of them screaming, saying, get on the floor or I'll kill you.
[00:45:37.305 --> 00:45:39.286]  I mean, it's open, it's shut.
[00:45:39.286 --> 00:45:46.130]  I'll tell you what's open and shut now, that these people are given a green light to go crazy.
[00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:48.352]  And then what do you do when you have a lawless government ruling over you?
[00:45:49.861 --> 00:45:57.204]  Well, you're smart about it, you don't let them start a civil war so that the resistance is just against the general government itself, which is as disgusting as anybody else's.
[00:45:57.204 --> 00:46:10.170]  But you gotta navigate that, be as wise as a serpent and peaceful as a dove, but at some point, you know, this thing turns into 1776 because they're gonna push it, they're gonna offensively come for our guns.
[00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.910]  That's what kicked it all off in 1775 at Lexington and Concord.
[00:46:16.545 --> 00:46:17.506]  We're good to go.
[00:46:32.387 --> 00:46:42.193]  Seven email chains concern matters that were classified at the top secret special access program at the time they were sent and received.
[00:46:42.193 --> 00:46:50.538]  Those chains involve Secretary Clinton both sending emails about those matters and receiving emails about those same matters.
[00:46:50.538 --> 00:46:55.881]  There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position
[00:46:56.611 --> 00:47:06.135]  Or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about those matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.
[00:47:06.135 --> 00:47:11.597]  In addition to this highly sensitive information, we also found information that was properly classified as secret by the U.S.
[00:47:11.597 --> 00:47:15.378]  intelligence community at the time it was discussed on email.
[00:47:15.378 --> 00:47:17.939]  That is, excluding any later up-classified emails.
[00:47:19.489 --> 00:47:23.812]  None of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system.
[00:47:23.812 --> 00:47:41.506]  But their presence is especially concerning because all of these emails were housed on unclassified personal servers, not even supported by full-time security staff, like those found at agencies and departments of the United States government, or even with a commercial email service like Gmail.
[00:47:43.387 --> 00:47:47.710]  I think it's also important to say something about the marking of classified information.
[00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:56.817]  Only a very small number of the emails here containing classified information bore markings that indicated the presence of classified information.
[00:47:56.817 --> 00:48:07.425]  But even if information is not marked classified in an email, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it.
[00:48:09.403 --> 00:48:23.960]  And while not the focus of our investigation, we also developed evidence that the security culture of the State Department, in general, and with respect to the use of unclassified systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:24.981]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:48:24.981 --> 00:48:27.304]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[00:48:27.304 --> 00:48:27.865]  Here's the deal.
[00:48:29.079 --> 00:48:32.001]  He called a year ago, Larry Nichols, former Clinton insider.
[00:48:32.001 --> 00:48:36.585]  He said that they were having the media push the email thing because they knew how it would end in the end.
[00:48:36.585 --> 00:48:46.993]  And that would be a distraction from all the other incredible corruption, the missile secrets, the rapes, the Obama and Hillary and the persecution of Christians.
[00:48:46.993 --> 00:48:50.296]  But imagine with everything we've seen, what they're going to do now.
[00:48:50.796 --> 00:48:58.499]  It's a big question to ask, because this is truly some of the most open, brazen, above-the-law declaration of tyranny I've ever seen.
[00:48:58.499 --> 00:48:59.919]  Let's go to Jerry.
[00:48:59.919 --> 00:49:01.580]  Jerry from Washington.
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:02.220]  You're on the air.
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:02.860]  Go ahead, Jerry.
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:06.081]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[00:49:06.081 --> 00:49:07.622]  I appreciate your show very much.
[00:49:07.622 --> 00:49:11.383]  I've been listening for about five years.
[00:49:11.383 --> 00:49:20.006]  I'm a government contractor, and I've been working for five years, and we have training that we have to do four times a year.
[00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:24.871]  And in that training list is information protection.
[00:49:24.871 --> 00:49:35.195]  The first thing they cover is you cannot store any government information on any cell phones, any other emails.
[00:49:35.195 --> 00:49:37.456]  You can't send it to your private email.
[00:49:37.456 --> 00:49:46.999]  You can't send it to somebody else's private email unless that email is a business that we are doing business with.
[00:49:46.999 --> 00:49:49.220]  This is a choice.
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:49.980]  This is something...
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:50:06.728]  When I just heard the first clip you played and the second clip you played, and they're talking about whether it's confidential, whether it's classified information, whatever it is, that's a bunch of bull, okay?
[00:50:06.728 --> 00:50:11.330]  Because you have to save every bit of government information.
[00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:12.831]  Sure, it's all compartmentalized.
[00:50:13.882 --> 00:50:14.702]  That's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:50:14.702 --> 00:50:15.783]  This is a choice because she knew better.
[00:50:15.783 --> 00:50:17.463]  She has to take that training.
[00:50:17.463 --> 00:50:19.444]  Everybody has to take that training.
[00:50:37.316 --> 00:50:37.957]  Absolutely.
[00:50:37.957 --> 00:50:40.478]  And then she knew it was compromised by foreign governments.
[00:50:40.478 --> 00:50:41.099]  It's espionage, folks.
[00:50:41.099 --> 00:50:41.639]  Thank you, Jerry.
[00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:01.470]  Are you prepared to bug out?

[00:53:29.102 --> 00:53:30.283]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:53:30.283 --> 00:53:33.304]  Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day.
[00:53:33.304 --> 00:53:39.887]  The security industry uses hordes of salesmen to scare you into signing long-term contracts with no way out.
[00:53:39.887 --> 00:53:42.929]  Protect your family the right way with SimpliSafe.
[00:53:42.929 --> 00:53:52.334]  SimpliSafe has no long-term contracts, no hidden fees, 24-7 monitoring, and it's just $14.99 a month, three times less than most other security companies.

[00:53:56.596 --> 00:53:57.897]  SimpliSafeDefense.com.
[00:54:24.512 --> 00:54:27.473]  Look, it's like Benghazi.
[00:54:27.473 --> 00:54:32.455]  For 13 hours plus, they sit there and watch the stand-down take place.
[00:54:32.455 --> 00:54:35.396]  For 8 hours, they watch the firefight go on.
[00:54:35.396 --> 00:54:46.680]  Everybody who is in the military and understands how that works, or the thousands that saw it on the Predator drone feeds, or the thousands that have since seen the recordings of those feeds, know there was a stand-down.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.141]  We have the witnesses who received the stand-down.
[00:54:49.821 --> 00:54:53.363]  So we know they're lying, just like we know about the servers.
[00:54:53.363 --> 00:54:57.486]  She first said she didn't have separate servers and didn't have separate emails.
[00:54:57.486 --> 00:55:03.389]  Remember the head of the Environmental Protection Agency had to resign a few years ago because she had secret emails?
[00:55:03.389 --> 00:55:08.492]  They operate outside of government oversight and citizen oversight with these systems.
[00:55:08.492 --> 00:55:10.733]  But with Hillary it goes far further.
[00:55:10.733 --> 00:55:13.755]  She knew foreign governments had penetrated.
[00:55:13.755 --> 00:55:14.996]  She knew they were getting that data.
[00:55:16.994 --> 00:55:27.598]  Now, unless it was some super-secret program to feed them disinfo or something, like the Enigma machines or whatever, we know it is espionage.
[00:55:27.598 --> 00:55:33.380]  But the fact that they've brought all this out in front of everyone just shows it's just what Larry Nichols said.
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:34.700]  It's meant to break our will.
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:35.881]  It's not breaking my will.
[00:55:35.881 --> 00:55:39.862]  I'm going to Robert in Tennessee and others here in a moment.
[00:55:39.862 --> 00:55:45.384]  I'm not going to belabor this, but we are extending the July 4th Independence Day specials
[00:55:46.044 --> 00:55:51.769]  We are extending those right through this week, because folks have really been taking advantage of it.
[00:55:51.769 --> 00:55:58.954]  20 to 40% off all of the super high quality storable foods at InfoWareSelect.com or InfoWareStore.com.
[00:55:58.954 --> 00:56:00.896]  20% off all Lexapur water filters.
[00:56:00.896 --> 00:56:03.558]  20% off all Lexapur air filters.
[00:56:03.558 --> 00:56:05.840]  20% off Survival Shield Mason Iodine X-Tube.
[00:56:07.435 --> 00:56:10.738]  We are extending this, and folks, it's now time to get prepared.
[00:56:10.738 --> 00:56:13.841]  It's now time to get ready with all the global upheaval, you name it.
[00:56:13.841 --> 00:56:16.824]  The globalists are instituting economic situations.
[00:56:16.824 --> 00:56:18.305]  They're instituting wars.
[00:56:18.305 --> 00:56:19.907]  They want to make us dependent on them.
[00:56:19.907 --> 00:56:20.788]  It is a no-brainer.
[00:56:21.578 --> 00:56:23.840]  That we all get prepared and we all get ready.
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:32.928]  We're going to fly Hillary for prison banners over the RNC and the DNC and the purchase of Hillary for prison t-shirts is what helps fund that.
[00:56:32.928 --> 00:56:42.756]  And regardless of whether she gets indicted in a federal court, we have indicted her in the court of public opinion and we are convicting her in this campaign.
[00:56:42.756 --> 00:56:45.498]  We must defeat Hillary Clinton.
[00:56:45.498 --> 00:56:45.999]  A vote for
[00:56:47.014 --> 00:56:50.777]  Justice, a vote for people not being above the law.
[00:56:50.777 --> 00:56:52.879]  My gosh, we gotta get Donald Trump in there.
[00:56:52.879 --> 00:56:55.160]  My gosh, Hillary is a crime boss.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:57.122]  Imagine what she'll do if we don't kick her out.
[00:56:57.122 --> 00:57:01.665]  And they're gonna engage in election fraud, but it's hard to beat a landslide.
[00:57:01.665 --> 00:57:03.407]  She's already stolen it from Bernie Sanders.
[00:57:03.407 --> 00:57:06.970]  This is such a rigged system, just as Donald Trump says.
[00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:08.511]  Robert in Tennessee, thanks for holding.
[00:57:08.511 --> 00:57:11.433]  What's your take on this?
[00:57:11.433 --> 00:57:12.514]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:57:12.514 --> 00:57:14.395]  Good my friend, go ahead.
[00:57:14.395 --> 00:57:15.096]  Good, alright.
[00:57:15.515 --> 00:57:17.796]  First of all, I just want to say I'm a big fan.
[00:57:17.796 --> 00:57:21.997]  You've woken up myself, my family, friends.
[00:57:21.997 --> 00:57:25.577]  And it's really amazing what you guys over at you and your crew do.
[00:57:25.577 --> 00:57:27.138]  We do have an amazing crew.
[00:57:27.138 --> 00:57:29.218]  We do have an amazing crew.
[00:57:29.218 --> 00:57:33.619]  In fact, I just this weekend got my Hillary for prison shirt in the mail.
[00:57:33.619 --> 00:57:34.580]  So thank you.
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:40.921]  I'm looking forward to promoting freedom this upcoming election season.
[00:57:40.921 --> 00:57:43.422]  But I just had a quick point and a
[00:57:44.429 --> 00:57:46.731]  And a question I wanted to ask you.
[00:57:46.731 --> 00:58:03.046]  I just literally read the news about Hillary not being charged for what she's been criminally been involved in just minutes before you went on air and I kind of got a sick feeling in my stomach because it just
[00:58:03.746 --> 00:58:08.410]  It goes to show how corrupt our government really is.
[00:58:08.410 --> 00:58:09.091]  I did too.
[00:58:09.091 --> 00:58:09.952]  I did too.
[00:58:09.952 --> 00:58:10.712]  I got nauseous.
[00:58:10.712 --> 00:58:12.033]  I was in a good mood this morning.
[00:58:12.033 --> 00:58:12.854]  Then I saw that.
[00:58:12.854 --> 00:58:14.015]  I'm just in a terrible mood now.
[00:58:14.015 --> 00:58:15.937]  But I'm not going to let her break my will.
[00:58:15.937 --> 00:58:16.758]  She's over the top.
[00:58:16.758 --> 00:58:17.498]  She's arrogant.
[00:58:17.498 --> 00:58:19.020]  Look how freaked out Comey looked.
[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:27.125]  He looked like a fox caught with a big old rabbit in his mouth, you know, in the rabbit coop or the chicken coop.
[00:58:27.125 --> 00:58:29.627]  I mean, he looked like he was freaked out.
[00:58:29.627 --> 00:58:31.448]  Look, this isn't good for these crooks.
[00:58:31.448 --> 00:58:35.491]  We've reached that moment where the crooks can't help themselves, and they're uncloaking themselves.
[00:58:35.491 --> 00:58:38.433]  It's gonna get rough, but there's light at the end of the tunnel.
[00:58:38.433 --> 00:58:39.394]  Good to hear from you, Robert.
[00:58:39.394 --> 00:58:41.135]  Sorry to hear you felt sick about that.
[00:58:41.135 --> 00:58:42.436]  That's a normal response, though.
[00:58:42.436 --> 00:58:44.857]  Kenneth, Vincent, Nick, Brady, stay with us.
[00:58:50.137 --> 00:58:56.082]  Supermail Vitality is InfoWarsLife.com's number one selling product for a good reason.
[00:58:56.082 --> 00:58:56.822]  It works.

[00:59:43.341 --> 00:59:52.144]  I'm Alex Jones for Super Mel Vitality and InfoWarsLife.com and I salute you, our supporters!
[00:59:52.144 --> 00:59:54.785]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:02.702 --> 01:00:09.357]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:09.357 --> 01:00:12.323]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:36.929 --> 01:00:38.791]  And we are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:38.791 --> 01:00:42.936]  Wow, I just came screeching into the chair here, working on news during that break.
[01:00:42.936 --> 01:00:45.259]  Forgot that was a 70-second break, not a three-minute one.
[01:00:45.259 --> 01:00:46.841]  I'm, like, running back in here.
[01:00:46.841 --> 01:00:50.385]  We've got a bunch of big guests coming up here today.
[01:00:50.385 --> 01:00:53.268]  Obviously, we're going to have a panel discussion with Leanne McAdoo.
[01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:58.991]  And of course, David Knight and Jakari Jackson at the bottom of this hour.
[01:00:58.991 --> 01:01:01.212]  Dr. Jerome Corsi pops in at the start of the next segment.
[01:01:01.212 --> 01:01:02.432]  He's got a new book out.
[01:01:02.432 --> 01:01:05.613]  We're also going to be talking about this non-indictment and more.
[01:01:05.613 --> 01:01:10.154]  Roger Stone has got big news on the Clintons being Chinese Communist agents.
[01:01:10.154 --> 01:01:15.375]  And Paul Joseph Watson hosts the fourth hour of Overdrive from Her Britannic Majesty's England.
[01:01:16.315 --> 01:01:19.799]  So that is all coming up today.
[01:01:19.799 --> 01:01:26.565]  Before I go any further, we are going to be taking your phone calls, by the way, interspersed throughout the broadcast.
[01:01:26.565 --> 01:01:34.232]  All I'm asking is, like Limbaugh used to say, I understand your listeners, you're supporting us, we love you, we appreciate you, we thank you.
[01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:35.334]  We couldn't do any of this without you.
[01:01:36.328 --> 01:01:43.453]  But when I go to your calls, I really want to hear what you think about what happened with Hillary and the indictment and where you think this country's going.
[01:01:43.453 --> 01:01:48.417]  Because it gets a little obscene when we take call after call telling me how great I am.
[01:01:48.417 --> 01:01:49.097]  You're great.
[01:01:49.097 --> 01:01:50.538]  You're awesome, okay?
[01:01:50.538 --> 01:01:54.681]  But listen, I love everybody that loves freedom as well.
[01:01:54.681 --> 01:01:55.502]  We're in this together.
[01:01:55.502 --> 01:01:59.144]  I think we're going to win it, but we've got to stay focused on fighting the globalists.
[01:01:59.144 --> 01:02:00.025]  Kenneth in New York.
[01:02:00.025 --> 01:02:00.565]  You're on the air.
[01:02:00.565 --> 01:02:03.467]  Go ahead.
[01:02:03.467 --> 01:02:03.908]  Alex?
[01:02:03.908 --> 01:02:04.168]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:05.382 --> 01:02:05.962]  Yes.
[01:02:05.962 --> 01:02:12.204]  Oh, I'm just so disgusted with Hillary, you know, just seeing this blatant corruption.
[01:02:12.204 --> 01:02:17.046]  It proves as a millennial to me that everything that you were saying is, I mean, it's true.
[01:02:17.046 --> 01:02:18.306]  It gives credibility.
[01:02:18.306 --> 01:02:20.947]  It's just, I have no, I have no words.
[01:02:20.947 --> 01:02:25.388]  I mean, you know, what happens if she gets in, we're done.
[01:02:25.388 --> 01:02:28.569]  We're finished as a country, in my opinion.
[01:02:30.899 --> 01:02:50.286]  Well, when you look at how ignorant the average voter is, at least half of them, that's why these tyrants are so emboldened, is we're looking at just incredibly dumbed-down, stupid people, who as long as they're pandered to verbally, they're not really supported, but as long as the establishment panders to them and packs them on the head, they'll jump off a cliff.
[01:02:50.286 --> 01:02:56.328]  Right, and you know, it's unreal, you know, and we'll see, I guess, at the elections,
[01:02:58.217 --> 01:02:59.218]  How this will all play out.
[01:02:59.218 --> 01:03:00.398]  But we need Trump.
[01:03:00.398 --> 01:03:01.939]  We need Trump desperately.
[01:03:01.939 --> 01:03:05.341]  Can you imagine what Hillary's going to do if she gets in?
[01:03:05.341 --> 01:03:07.442]  I mean, she's going to go for broke.
[01:03:07.442 --> 01:03:10.464]  This will be like nothing we've ever seen.
[01:03:10.464 --> 01:03:11.824]  Worse than Obama.
[01:03:11.824 --> 01:03:13.165]  Worse than the Bushes.
[01:03:13.165 --> 01:03:14.166]  The Bush crime family.
[01:03:14.166 --> 01:03:15.386]  Everything you talked about.
[01:03:15.386 --> 01:03:17.087]  I mean, it all comes down to this.
[01:03:17.087 --> 01:03:18.608]  The technocrats.
[01:03:18.608 --> 01:03:20.489]  All the automation coming in.
[01:03:20.489 --> 01:03:21.209]  Everything.
[01:03:21.209 --> 01:03:21.950]  The fluoride.
[01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:24.051]  I mean, everything is going to be ending up with her.
[01:03:24.051 --> 01:03:27.133]  I do see that.
[01:03:27.133 --> 01:03:27.553]  She gets in.
[01:03:28.595 --> 01:03:29.376]  Good points, Kenneth.
[01:03:29.376 --> 01:03:30.276]  Thank you for the call.
[01:03:30.276 --> 01:03:32.638]  Nick in the great state of Illinois.
[01:03:32.638 --> 01:03:33.438]  Nick, you're on the air.
[01:03:33.438 --> 01:03:34.699]  Welcome.
[01:03:34.699 --> 01:03:35.059]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:35.059 --> 01:03:35.680]  Thank you.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.082]  I pray for you and pray for Trump every day.
[01:03:38.082 --> 01:03:39.563]  Thank you.
[01:03:39.563 --> 01:03:52.772]  It's almost as if they're pushing for a citizen's arrest for her because no one else is stepping up to the plate to be a leader and make something happen and indict her.
[01:03:52.772 --> 01:03:55.834]  And I just wish that Trump would give
[01:03:56.648 --> 01:03:59.785]  Ron Paul or Jesse Ventura are called to be on his VP list.
[01:04:00.825 --> 01:04:04.347]  Well, you know, Ventura would obviously want to do that.
[01:04:04.347 --> 01:04:08.830]  Paul is, I guess, being a purist, you know, when it comes to Trump.
[01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:10.111]  But Trump is a nationalist.
[01:04:10.111 --> 01:04:12.253]  He's an anti-globalist.
[01:04:12.253 --> 01:04:18.417]  He has really... I've gone from holding my nose supporting him a year ago to really being proud of the fact I supported him.
[01:04:18.417 --> 01:04:22.399]  Because despite some of Trump's problems, he's for real.
[01:04:22.399 --> 01:04:24.101]  He's got a lot of courage.
[01:04:24.101 --> 01:04:30.025]  And he is just a great manifestation of America's... probably America's last chance.
[01:04:31.285 --> 01:04:36.568]  You know, we've killed hundreds of millions of babies, and we've been so corrupt and evil so long.
[01:04:36.568 --> 01:04:41.150]  Maybe we're just supposed to totally fall and collapse and, you know, the country's just supposed to burn.
[01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:45.893]  I mean, maybe that's what the socialists want, and that's what they want, that's what they get.
[01:04:45.893 --> 01:04:50.995]  I mean, but it really is up to us to decide that, but I hear you, brother.
[01:04:50.995 --> 01:04:52.696]  Great point, Nick.
[01:04:52.696 --> 01:04:53.757]  I appreciate your call.
[01:04:53.757 --> 01:04:56.658]  More calls from Brady, Denise, Vincent, Bill, and others.
[01:04:56.658 --> 01:04:57.859]  Straight ahead on Alex Jones.
[01:05:00.089 --> 01:05:03.734]  Let's face it, most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones.
[01:05:03.734 --> 01:05:08.520]  But recent studies link cell phone use to major health issues, including brain cancer.
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:12.265]  Experts say parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful.
[01:05:12.265 --> 01:05:16.390]  Doctors say the infant brain, even while in the womb, is especially vulnerable.
[01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:20.834]  So keep the phone away from your abdomen, especially toward the end of pregnancy.
[01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:26.360]  And for men, using a cell phone for as little as an hour a day is literally cooking your sperm.
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:30.985]  Lowering sperm count levels so much that conceiving a child could be difficult.
[01:05:30.985 --> 01:05:33.227]  This is one of those times you want to keep it out of your pants.
[01:05:33.627 --> 01:05:39.068]  And for those of us who use our cell phones before bed, know that the screen light is actually disrupting your sleep rhythms.
[01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:41.729]  This causes insomnia and slows the metabolism.
[01:05:41.729 --> 01:05:43.009]  Hello, weight gain!
[01:05:43.009 --> 01:05:48.110]  Generally speaking, when cell phones are on, they're constantly emitting radio frequency radiation.
[01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:50.391]  So keep your phone in airplane mode when you can.
[01:05:50.391 --> 01:05:52.991]  Keep the phone at least two feet away from your body.
[01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:53.932]  Use headphones.
[01:05:53.932 --> 01:05:57.252]  And when you're not on your phone, keep it as far away from you as possible.
[01:05:57.252 --> 01:05:59.293]  Leigh Ann McAdoo with your InfoWars Tip of the Week.
[01:05:59.853 --> 01:06:00.673]  Hey, everyone.
[01:06:00.673 --> 01:06:02.974]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:06:02.974 --> 01:06:06.794]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:06:06.794 --> 01:06:08.895]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:06:08.895 --> 01:06:19.157]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:06:19.157 --> 01:06:25.138]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:06:25.618 --> 01:06:40.555]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[01:06:40.575 --> 01:06:40.975]  I think so.
[01:06:59.787 --> 01:07:08.029]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[01:07:08.029 --> 01:07:09.249]  A 360 win.
[01:07:09.249 --> 01:07:15.810]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:23.352]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:07:23.732 --> 01:07:28.814]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:07:28.814 --> 01:07:34.916]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:42.719]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:07:42.719 --> 01:07:49.922]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:07:49.922 --> 01:07:50.722]  10% off on AutoShip.
[01:07:50.882 --> 01:07:53.324]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:53.324 --> 01:07:55.305]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:07:55.305 --> 01:08:01.830]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:08:01.830 --> 01:08:04.612]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.612 --> 01:08:07.394]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.228 --> 01:08:21.456]  Well, his book came out a few weeks ago with the headline, Partners in Crime.
[01:08:21.456 --> 01:08:30.492]  And I tell you, this multi-time number one New York Times best-selling author couldn't have been more dead-on WorldNetDailyBooks.
[01:08:32.188 --> 01:08:50.054]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, who's worked in anti-terrorism and clandestine consulting operations, who's been involved in international banking, has multiple degrees, of course, taught his class there at Harvard, good long-term friends for 40 years with Donald Trump.
[01:08:50.054 --> 01:08:59.197]  So I couldn't think of someone better, in the next 25 minutes we have with him, to cover the waterfront, because we have just seen the FBI director about
[01:09:00.327 --> 01:09:06.151]  An hour and 30 minutes ago concluded a press conference where he said no indictment.
[01:09:06.151 --> 01:09:07.792]  He will not recommend an indictment.
[01:09:07.792 --> 01:09:12.315]  And Lance said that she would go with his recommendation if she agreed with it, basically.
[01:09:12.315 --> 01:09:14.596]  That was the proviso we played on Friday.
[01:09:14.596 --> 01:09:18.959]  She said, well, she wouldn't recuse herself in case she disagreed with it, but she'd have to review it.
[01:09:18.959 --> 01:09:26.284]  So Dr. Jerome Corsi joins us to talk about that, to talk about Trump and where all this is going.
[01:09:26.284 --> 01:09:28.566]  I have to be honest with the audience, OK?
[01:09:29.992 --> 01:09:37.038]  I have never had a more disgusting feeling of dread in my stomach.
[01:09:37.038 --> 01:09:40.160]  I actually feel like someone's choking me right now.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.203]  And of course, we've all been at the hospital and family members are dying or we've been at funerals.
[01:09:44.203 --> 01:09:46.565]  I mean, I've been in big car wrecks and things.
[01:09:46.565 --> 01:09:50.128]  I'm not saying I'm Mr. Tough Guy, but I've been through some bad experiences.
[01:09:50.128 --> 01:09:56.653]  And I guess to kind of analyze my own psychological perspective, I've been dealing with the Clintons for 20 plus years.
[01:09:56.653 --> 01:09:57.774]  I know how evil they are.
[01:09:58.214 --> 01:10:07.723]  And it really is disheartening to realize that they're about to get even more power, and are getting more corrupt as they go along, and have promised to come after the Liberty Movement and the Patriots.
[01:10:07.723 --> 01:10:15.090]  And she's starting all these wars, and she's working with Al Qaeda and ISIS, and they've been persecuting Christians and conservatives and veterans and people.
[01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:20.214]  I mean, to come to grips with the fact that she looks three or four times crazier than she did in the 90s.
[01:10:21.462 --> 01:10:30.147]  And the way she acts and bragging about killing people and lying about, you know, Brian Williams stories about how she's in combat.
[01:10:30.147 --> 01:10:32.348]  I mean, there's just not just a feeling.
[01:10:32.348 --> 01:10:42.674]  There is a total intellectual understanding bodily at a cellular level of getting ready for a physical fight.
[01:10:42.674 --> 01:10:45.516]  I mean, I physically, physically,
[01:10:46.664 --> 01:10:49.345]  I feel like I'm in a parking lot and a guy just pulled a gun on me.
[01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:51.706]  I know that's happened before, back when I was growing up in Dallas.
[01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:55.728]  I mean, I have that same feeling of disgust and dread and not fear.
[01:10:55.728 --> 01:10:58.249]  It's more like, get ready.
[01:10:59.246 --> 01:11:04.589]  Now I want to go to Dr. Corsi to discuss this and more, her communist Chinese connections, all of it.
[01:11:04.589 --> 01:11:05.929]  It is incredible.
[01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:28.140]  I want to ask Dr. Corsi out of the gates, what his view of this, where this is going, and of course his book, Perfectly Timed, with the proper name and the research of these partners in crime, Bill and Hillary, what they're planning to do, because I have a gut feeling and intellectual understanding that they are going to get their total wish list now and go for broke.
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:32.301]  Is that an accurate statement, Dr. Corsi?
[01:11:32.301 --> 01:11:33.382]  I agree with you entirely.
[01:11:33.382 --> 01:11:37.083]  I mean, I think what we see today is that the fix is in.
[01:11:37.083 --> 01:11:45.046]  I mean, clearly, you've got the FBI, you know, listen carefully to Comey's statement.
[01:11:45.046 --> 01:11:53.109]  He basically said Hillary committed a number of crimes, that she's guilty of criminal negligence, and yet she's going to skate.
[01:11:53.109 --> 01:11:55.490]  She's not going to get indicted for things that normally
[01:11:56.050 --> 01:12:02.552]  People like Petraeus and others would have have been prosecuted for, you know, double standard of law.
[01:12:02.552 --> 01:12:05.512]  And now Hillary Clinton has clearly tainted goods.
[01:12:05.512 --> 01:12:15.855]  It's obvious she lied that she had classified emails that were transmitted over her server that she knew about and should have known about.
[01:12:15.855 --> 01:12:17.675]  But yet she's not going to be prosecuted.
[01:12:18.365 --> 01:12:20.385]  Now, this again is a double standard.
[01:12:20.385 --> 01:12:23.146]  And by the way, Alex, the whole thing looks like a setup.
[01:12:23.146 --> 01:12:27.147]  I mean, you have Bill Clinton on the tarmac.
[01:12:27.147 --> 01:12:28.347]  Wink, wink.
[01:12:28.347 --> 01:12:29.847]  Loretta Lynch.
[01:12:29.847 --> 01:12:34.988]  Then CNN starts, you know, tweeting that they have inside sources.
[01:12:34.988 --> 01:12:37.248]  There's going to be no prosecution.
[01:12:37.248 --> 01:12:44.970]  Hillary comes in over the holiday and testifies or gives an interview with the FBI.
[01:12:44.970 --> 01:12:46.750]  And then here we are immediately after
[01:12:47.717 --> 01:12:49.537]  Comey saying no prosecution.
[01:12:49.537 --> 01:12:56.039]  Hillary shows up in North Carolina flying on Air Force One with Barack Obama.
[01:12:56.039 --> 01:13:07.162]  The whole thing looks as orchestrated as when Candy Crowley pulled out, you know, the speech that Obama gave after Benghazi during the debate with Romney.
[01:13:07.162 --> 01:13:10.462]  It looks completely choreographed and wink-wink.
[01:13:10.462 --> 01:13:14.283]  Even Loretta Lynch saying, I'll just accept the recommendation of the FBI.
[01:13:14.283 --> 01:13:16.584]  Sure, she already knew the FBI wasn't going to prosecute.
[01:13:17.304 --> 01:13:19.345]  Doctor, let me ask you this.
[01:13:19.345 --> 01:13:21.566]  I mean, you've been a political insider for a long time.
[01:13:21.566 --> 01:13:25.207]  You almost always call it like it is, almost like 99% of the time.
[01:13:25.207 --> 01:13:27.548]  What is the point of rubbing our faces in it?
[01:13:27.548 --> 01:13:35.212]  What is the point of acting so incredibly arrogant and Hillary kind of letting them have that let them eat cake moment, it seems?
[01:13:35.212 --> 01:13:36.852]  Or is this just megalomania?
[01:13:36.852 --> 01:13:43.215]  Is this just people that have decided, as a political class, they have Republican establishment cover, they're going to go for broke?
[01:13:43.902 --> 01:13:53.148]  Yeah, I mean, the Clintons' attitude, like it was and has been in Europe with the EU, is, you know, the United States would be a good country except for the voters.
[01:13:53.148 --> 01:13:55.329]  We'd be just fine if the voters could be ignored.
[01:13:55.329 --> 01:14:08.177]  The voters are stupid, they don't know what they're doing, so the elites, the Clintons, who are above the law, get to determine how they can make vast riches, you know, billions of dollars out of the Clinton Foundation.
[01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:10.358]  Something we would go to jail for doing.
[01:14:11.058 --> 01:14:18.962]  How she can violate national security laws with her emails, which even the FBI admits is negligent, reckless.
[01:14:18.962 --> 01:14:25.426]  How are we going to elect a reckless, negligent, incompetent person who can't run a BlackBerry to be President of the United States?
[01:14:25.426 --> 01:14:32.809]  But of course, that's all supposed to be washed away because we've got a photo op, an Air Force one, with Barack Obama and Hillary.
[01:14:32.809 --> 01:14:35.291]  They're going to hold hands and do kissy face.
[01:14:35.991 --> 01:14:39.094]  And tell the people we need to have Hillary for eight years.
[01:14:39.094 --> 01:14:40.655]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:14:40.655 --> 01:14:44.018]  She's claiming she's going to go to the center of elected.
[01:14:44.018 --> 01:14:47.461]  But from what I've seen them setting up and their preparations, it looks like the opposite.
[01:14:47.461 --> 01:14:53.446]  From your sources and your own political gravitas, if she gets in, what do you expect to happen?
[01:14:53.446 --> 01:14:56.148]  Again, my gut tells me leave the country.
[01:14:57.139 --> 01:15:01.660]  Well, I mean, first, certainly you're right in terms of that she's going to go more to the left.
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:02.821]  There's no question about it.
[01:15:02.821 --> 01:15:06.482]  I mean, Hillary has had Huma Abedin advise her.
[01:15:06.482 --> 01:15:09.262]  She was the one who is, I think, the butcher of Libya.
[01:15:09.262 --> 01:15:19.305]  I think you're going to find in the coming months that Hillary was the one who destabilized Libya, abused women throughout Libya, let Ivia go to the Al Qaeda terrorists.
[01:15:19.975 --> 01:15:32.506]  This has already been clear from the Benghazi investigations we've had, especially the Citizens Commission on Benghazi, made it absolutely clear that Hillary threw Libya to the dogs.
[01:15:32.506 --> 01:15:40.594]  I think with the Clinton Foundation, with things that I'm proving in my book and others, you know, we've got Peter Schweitzer out there as well.
[01:15:40.594 --> 01:15:43.296]  Clinton's wanted the oil in Libya.
[01:15:43.296 --> 01:15:46.219]  They wanted to gain economically with Blumenthal.
[01:15:47.099 --> 01:15:49.482]  They didn't care if millions died in the process?
[01:16:04.076 --> 01:16:12.579]  Fake science that's going to further destroy the United States' ability to be an industry leader, world leader, and coal and oil.
[01:16:12.579 --> 01:16:15.900]  Obama's just about shut down the coal industry.
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:17.900]  Hillary will make sure it's killed.
[01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:20.761]  They need to go issue after issue.
[01:16:20.761 --> 01:16:30.144]  And what's going to happen is, and by the way, conservatives, anyone who disagrees with this far leftist agenda is going to be identified as hate crime.
[01:16:30.144 --> 01:16:33.465]  We'll be putting, you know, concentration camps for thought reform.
[01:16:34.205 --> 01:16:39.249]  It'll be criminal to do things like be a climate denier.
[01:16:39.249 --> 01:16:42.611]  Meanwhile, Israel's going to be abandoned, thrown to the dogs.
[01:16:42.611 --> 01:16:51.078]  Iran's already been given free reign to develop nuclear weapons, and the Iranians are saying they've got 100,000 missiles pointed at Israel.
[01:16:51.078 --> 01:16:54.160]  No one's going to stand up under a Clinton administration for Israel.
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:17:00.505]  We're going to have deficits that are going to bankrupt average Americans, throw us into a global currency.
[01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:01.383]  Wow!
[01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:01.463]  Well...
[01:17:24.713 --> 01:17:29.414]  I kind of feel like we're sitting here, Dr. Corsi, just calmly presiding over the death of the Republic.
[01:17:29.414 --> 01:17:44.257]  There have been so many signposts, so many indicators of a political class and foreign interest being basically somewhat invincible because of the corruption at the top, but now it seems to be getting worse.
[01:17:44.257 --> 01:17:46.998]  I mean, is it accurate that it's getting worse, or do we just know more about it now?
[01:17:47.850 --> 01:17:49.271]  Oh, I think it's a combination.
[01:17:49.271 --> 01:17:50.332]  I mean, you've done a great deal.
[01:17:50.332 --> 01:18:02.879]  We've all worked to expose the corruption, to expose the far-left agenda for what it is, which is totalitarianism and elimination of the Constitution and our free speech.
[01:18:02.879 --> 01:18:06.822]  We're going to have a Supreme Court that's going to be unimaginable under Hillary Clinton.
[01:18:07.738 --> 01:18:15.561]  You're going to find that, I think like in Europe, Americans are waking up and I think saying enough to this agenda.
[01:18:15.561 --> 01:18:17.542]  But this is a critical time.
[01:18:17.542 --> 01:18:25.105]  If Hillary Clinton manages to be president, then the Clinton Foundation is going to go into overdrive.
[01:18:25.105 --> 01:18:29.006]  Obama will have his own criminal foundation.
[01:18:29.006 --> 01:18:33.748]  Politicians in the United States will be in it for one reason, that is money, maybe money and power.
[01:18:34.488 --> 01:18:37.731]  You'll see the rich get richer, the global rich.
[01:18:37.731 --> 01:18:46.600]  They'll be the extremely well-off, and then everybody else who can barely not buy a house or, you know, live from paycheck to paycheck.
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:47.561]  And they won't care.
[01:18:47.561 --> 01:18:49.503]  The global elite won't care.
[01:18:49.503 --> 01:18:54.948]  There'll be lie after lie after lie, a double standard of prosecution.
[01:18:54.948 --> 01:18:58.292]  Conservatives will be defined as politically criminals.
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:10.207]  Well, the Clintons making millions, you know, ignoring laws with regards to classified information, running their all above the law entirely.
[01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:40.402]  And while he's talking, I'm being flooded with just backup articles and things that we've seen where they're openly on the Democratic Party platform.
[01:19:40.402 --> 01:19:44.823]  Daily Caller reported last week saying they want to arrest climate change deniers.
[01:19:44.823 --> 01:19:48.543]  They want to now start arresting people in Canada and the U.S.
[01:19:48.543 --> 01:19:50.984]  and Europe that say there's only two genders.
[01:19:50.984 --> 01:19:56.765]  I mean, this is true totalitarianism with a dumbed-down mass of minions behind it, and it looks like the left
[01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:58.947]  Well, in fact, I think what you're seeing today with
[01:20:18.889 --> 01:20:24.836]  You know, Hillary Clinton being asked by Comey that the FBI is not going to recommend prosecution.
[01:20:24.836 --> 01:20:38.251]  Now you're going to see a run, you know, a mad run to the finish line where the globalists are going to try to take over power completely so that they can say the Brexit vote, well, we're just going to ignore it.
[01:20:38.251 --> 01:20:39.072]  We're going to slow it down.
[01:20:39.072 --> 01:20:39.953]  So they're going to try to show it up.
[01:20:40.626 --> 01:20:40.786]  This is
[01:20:55.754 --> 01:21:08.159]  To push the United States, and Hillary's the plan, the Bilderberger globalist plan is to do the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Trans-Atlantic Investment Partnership.
[01:21:08.159 --> 01:21:13.881]  This puts us into a global economic one world order that is the prelude
[01:21:14.261 --> 01:21:19.503]  It's what we're seeing now in the EU, where the EU is finally saying openly that they meant empire.
[01:21:19.503 --> 01:21:21.284]  They're going to have their own army.
[01:21:21.284 --> 01:21:24.846]  They're going to destroy the individual countries' legislatures.
[01:21:24.846 --> 01:21:27.527]  Italy is going to do what the EU wants it to do.
[01:21:27.527 --> 01:21:28.828]  That's always been the plan.
[01:21:29.828 --> 01:21:31.449]  It's been a lie from the very beginning.
[01:21:31.449 --> 01:21:36.672]  That's right, they now admit, oh we're just going to dissolve your military and we'll have an EU military and you can't leave.
[01:21:36.672 --> 01:21:44.397]  Open declaration of Hitlerian invasion or communist style, you know, Soviet takeover.
[01:21:44.397 --> 01:21:52.242]  I mean this is classic and they're doing it so nakedly, I guess because they're in power and it's the same thing, that will to power historically.
[01:21:52.242 --> 01:21:55.404]  Let me ask you this, you mentioned the Bilderberg Group, they had the professor there,
[01:21:56.164 --> 01:21:56.304]  Let's
[01:22:13.635 --> 01:22:22.541]  We are totalitarian, we are technocratic, we will take over your military, and we are going to make it where the money you get every month is controlled by us.
[01:22:22.541 --> 01:22:26.083]  I mean, that is a nightmare scenario, but it's coming from them.
[01:22:26.083 --> 01:22:31.867]  You would write books, I would write articles exposing these statements to say, look, this is horrible.
[01:22:31.867 --> 01:22:36.490]  Instead, they've got the political calculus, Dr. Jerome Corsi, of just throwing it in our face.
[01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:37.511]  What's the thinking there?
[01:22:38.231 --> 01:22:41.194]  Well, I mean, again, I think they're going to run to the finish line naked.
[01:22:41.194 --> 01:22:41.855]  They don't care.
[01:22:41.855 --> 01:22:50.022]  The things that we were, you know, branded conspiracy theorists and ridiculed by the globalists, now they're publishing openly.
[01:22:50.022 --> 01:22:52.885]  The EU has declared it wants to be an empire.
[01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:54.187]  And look, this all fits together.
[01:22:54.187 --> 01:22:59.872]  The same day, you've got Hillary's not going to be prosecuted, the FBI caves in, admits
[01:22:59.952 --> 01:23:03.133]  She broke laws, but who cares?
[01:23:03.133 --> 01:23:08.375]  You've got the House going to vote, the House Democrats pushing again for gun control.
[01:23:08.375 --> 01:23:11.336]  They're not going to give up pushing for the guns.
[01:23:11.336 --> 01:23:13.097]  Freedom by freedom here.
[01:23:13.097 --> 01:23:17.498]  So, you know, the elite don't have to face law the way we have to face law.
[01:23:17.498 --> 01:23:20.319]  Hillary, she did all these things.
[01:23:20.319 --> 01:23:22.220]  Yes, she lied.
[01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:22.740]  Well, there were
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.421]  Classified documents.
[01:23:24.421 --> 01:23:25.102]  She lied.
[01:23:25.102 --> 01:23:27.724]  She, you know, knew that documents were classified.
[01:23:27.724 --> 01:23:29.445]  They were marked, actually.
[01:23:29.445 --> 01:23:30.326]  But that's okay.
[01:23:30.326 --> 01:23:34.289]  Don't worry about it because, you know, we can't prove intent.
[01:23:34.289 --> 01:23:36.090]  Well, of course you can prove intent.
[01:23:36.090 --> 01:23:40.253]  You proved intent on Petraeus for far lesser crimes.
[01:23:40.253 --> 01:23:44.577]  She went to great pains to set up this separate email system, and she did it for a reason.
[01:23:44.577 --> 01:23:51.863]  The reason she did it was to evade all the government scrutiny, the FOIA requests, and to be able to pat her
[01:23:53.052 --> 01:24:04.420]  Personal piggy bank with the Clinton Foundation with all kinds of emails shared between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation where they could cash in on her various decisions.
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:06.582]  Selling State Department decisions.
[01:24:06.582 --> 01:24:09.264]  Of course, all this is just going to be excused.
[01:24:09.824 --> 01:24:17.190]  And we're going to be told, you know, by the officials that are there, that, oh, this is not a... we can't prosecute for this.
[01:24:17.190 --> 01:24:21.093]  You know, yes, all these crimes were committed, but we can't prosecute for this.
[01:24:21.093 --> 01:24:23.896]  Well, that's totalitarianism.
[01:24:23.896 --> 01:24:25.117]  That's the double standard.
[01:24:25.117 --> 01:24:26.398]  That's the elite.
[01:24:26.398 --> 01:24:28.840]  She's already been crowned part of the elite.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:32.042]  She's already been declared president by the Bilderberger Group.
[01:24:32.042 --> 01:24:33.924]  Now they're just going to play the show out.
[01:24:34.477 --> 01:24:35.577]  The drama.
[01:24:35.577 --> 01:24:45.381]  You know, we have the Comey press conference, and now we've got the Clinton appearance with Obama at Air Force One, which by the way, who paid for?
[01:24:45.381 --> 01:24:46.682]  Taxpayers.
[01:24:46.682 --> 01:24:59.647]  So here we get this coming on, and now we've got Obama, you know, kissy-kissy with Hillary, and she's going to be promoted as innocent, just pursued by the right wing, while she pushes the global agenda.
[01:25:00.367 --> 01:25:01.928]  Free trade agreements.
[01:25:01.928 --> 01:25:10.413]  Taking, you know, people don't realize that John Kerry signed the UN's gun declaration while all this was going on.
[01:25:10.413 --> 01:25:12.794]  The trade ambassador, U.S.
[01:25:12.794 --> 01:25:19.558]  Trade Ambassador Froman, declared that they were going to pass TP in the lame duck session.
[01:25:19.558 --> 01:25:25.562]  Lame duck session when, you know, in between the election and the new Congress coming in.
[01:25:25.562 --> 01:25:27.203]  The elite don't give up.
[01:25:27.808 --> 01:25:31.633]  And this is a, the elite today think they've won a victory.
[01:25:31.633 --> 01:25:34.397]  Now, won't the American people vote?
[01:25:34.397 --> 01:25:40.545]  And if the American people start listening and waking up and understanding that, you know, Donald Trump, imperfect though he may be.
[01:25:41.343 --> 01:25:45.547]  Is the only one who's going to call this without worrying about political correctness.
[01:25:45.547 --> 01:25:48.990]  That's just another standard so none of us tell the truth.
[01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:51.352]  I agree with you and by the way I think they've miscalculated.
[01:25:51.352 --> 01:26:01.300]  I think they're rushing the finish line out of concern and I think the fact that this isn't a regular cycle where you've got some milquetoast Republican that's going to lay down.
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:06.004]  His greatest attribute is he's brazen and brave and you know him well.
[01:26:06.004 --> 01:26:06.705]  He's committed
[01:26:07.505 --> 01:26:12.787]  To what he's doing, and so that's got to really worry Hillary when he gets into debates with her.
[01:26:12.787 --> 01:26:17.729]  And, you know, starts bringing all this up because, you know, they're hoping to keep this from her constituents.
[01:26:17.729 --> 01:26:24.692]  But as more of this comes out, I expect that 20, 30 percent that doesn't vote, a big percentage to switch to Trump.
[01:26:24.692 --> 01:26:27.073]  So, A, what do you think Trump should do?
[01:26:27.073 --> 01:26:29.974]  How do you think Hillary will strike back?
[01:26:29.974 --> 01:26:32.055]  And do you expect him to try to steal the election?
[01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:34.913]  They're going to try to steal the election, no question.
[01:26:34.913 --> 01:26:35.955]  They're going to do voter fraud.
[01:26:35.955 --> 01:26:37.777]  They're going to do everything they can.
[01:26:37.777 --> 01:26:39.800]  Trump is the real deal.
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.743]  I've known Trump a long time.
[01:26:41.743 --> 01:26:43.385]  He is the real deal.
[01:26:43.385 --> 01:26:46.189]  And he is going to say, these are criminals.
[01:26:47.248 --> 01:26:49.789]  And that they are criminals who think they're above the law.
[01:26:49.789 --> 01:26:55.331]  And if you allow them, they're now, as demonstrated here with the FBI, they're going to rig the law in their favor.
[01:26:55.331 --> 01:26:59.892]  They're going to run the foundation to make billions for themselves.
[01:26:59.892 --> 01:27:04.874]  You know, sending defective drugs to AIDS victims in Africa.
[01:27:04.874 --> 01:27:11.336]  Stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from the Unit Aid Fund through the UN.
[01:27:12.332 --> 01:27:16.556]  Filing fraudulent financial statements for their foundations.
[01:27:16.556 --> 01:27:18.017]  I mean, this is the real crime.
[01:27:18.017 --> 01:27:19.298]  This is the real stealing.
[01:27:19.298 --> 01:27:22.921]  You know, these are two grifters, Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[01:27:22.921 --> 01:27:29.647]  They have a trail behind them that stinks to high heaven of criminal activity and getting away with it.
[01:27:30.316 --> 01:27:33.138]  You know, no, I didn't really have sex with that woman.
[01:27:33.138 --> 01:27:37.082]  No, I didn't really violate any laws with my emails.
[01:27:37.082 --> 01:27:41.465]  Well, I didn't really benefit myself all that much from the Clinton Foundation.
[01:27:41.465 --> 01:27:42.987]  All lies.
[01:27:42.987 --> 01:27:43.847]  And this is the beginning.
[01:27:43.847 --> 01:27:46.750]  If the American people don't understand, go with Donald Trump.
[01:27:47.552 --> 01:27:52.135]  Saying that she's crooked, the system is rigged, it's time to stop it.
[01:27:52.135 --> 01:27:54.837]  You know, Thomas Jefferson was right.
[01:27:54.837 --> 01:27:58.220]  Every now and then, the elite just need to be thrown out.
[01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:08.967]  And this is a time when if the elite win now, there won't be a reversal of their control, domination, and push to totalitarianism.
[01:28:08.967 --> 01:28:09.748]  And we're not being
[01:28:11.505 --> 01:28:12.245]  Rhetorical here.
[01:28:12.245 --> 01:28:14.747]  We're not, you know, engaging in rhetoric.
[01:28:14.747 --> 01:28:15.627]  We're not hyping this.
[01:28:15.627 --> 01:28:31.935]  This is cut and dry what we're facing and I think people in the government, corporations, just the general public has to all start resisting every way they can and withdrawing our consent from this illegitimate federal government that has become a criminal occupied system, Dr. Corsi.
[01:28:31.935 --> 01:28:36.778]  I think that's all we can do and start really moving towards
[01:28:37.418 --> 01:28:38.679]  Well, I never thought I live in a country
[01:29:06.946 --> 01:29:10.632]  Where the government had gone so far to the totalitarian left.
[01:29:10.632 --> 01:29:15.519]  Using the IRS politically to punish conservatives.
[01:29:15.519 --> 01:29:16.761]  Defining as criminal.
[01:29:18.012 --> 01:29:25.095]  Expression which should be allowed under the First Amendment to be an objector to the whole science of climate change.
[01:29:25.095 --> 01:29:31.417]  And by the way, the last thing we'll do right now, gun push is going to intensify to get our guns away.
[01:29:31.417 --> 01:29:34.218]  That's the next thing you can expect.
[01:29:34.218 --> 01:29:38.459]  All right, Partners in Crime, the book, WorldNetDailyBooks, WND.com.
[01:29:38.459 --> 01:29:41.420]  Come back soon to talk about their next push, Dr. Corsi.
[01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:42.261]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:29:42.998 --> 01:29:43.939]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:29:43.939 --> 01:29:45.281]  Great pleasure to be with you.
[01:29:45.281 --> 01:29:46.102]  Thank you.
[01:29:46.102 --> 01:29:47.543]  Very dark times, folks.
[01:29:47.543 --> 01:29:49.426]  Very dark times.
[01:29:49.426 --> 01:29:50.827]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.827 --> 01:29:53.370]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.370 --> 01:29:56.034]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.874 --> 01:30:05.938]  The demand for pain-ray weapons grows over fears of civil unrest.
[01:30:05.938 --> 01:30:17.788]  According to a new research study, the market for directed-energy weapons is expected to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period thanks for their use in controlling riots and cross-border trespassing.
[01:30:17.788 --> 01:30:22.472]  The global riot control system market is estimated to grow from $9 billion in 2016 to $11.78 billion by 2021.
[01:30:27.196 --> 01:30:41.145]  As a result of increasing political disputes and civil unrest, militarization of law enforcement agencies, stringent environmental and governmental regulations, and declining defense budgets of developed economies, states the report.
[01:30:41.145 --> 01:30:52.271]  So-called pain rays or active denial systems work by blasting controlled microwaves into a crowd of people, creating an unbearably hot sensation that forces them to flee the scene.
[01:30:52.271 --> 01:30:56.014]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[01:31:30.009 --> 01:31:33.510]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:41.753]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:41.753 --> 01:31:47.174]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:32:00.398 --> 01:32:01.839]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:32:01.839 --> 01:32:03.159]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:32:03.159 --> 01:32:04.379]  Why is this so good?
[01:32:04.379 --> 01:32:09.661]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:32:09.661 --> 01:32:23.204]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:24.545]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:32:25.345 --> 01:32:26.987]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:32:26.987 --> 01:32:29.509]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:32:29.509 --> 01:32:30.870]  These are all parasites.
[01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:31.951]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:32:31.951 --> 01:32:33.312]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:32:33.312 --> 01:32:37.795]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:32:37.795 --> 01:32:40.978]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:32:41.038 --> 01:32:44.141]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:32:44.141 --> 01:32:45.181]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:32:45.181 --> 01:32:47.123]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:47.123 --> 01:32:48.144]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:32:48.144 --> 01:32:50.846]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:32:50.846 --> 01:32:54.108]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:54.108 --> 01:32:56.370]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:58.312]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:33:11.571 --> 01:33:18.354]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.354 --> 01:33:29.699]  All right, we are going to be going to your phone calls with Brady, and Denise, and Sargent, as well as Vincent, Shane, and others in the next half hour.
[01:33:29.699 --> 01:33:32.901]  It's a roundtable discussion.
[01:33:32.901 --> 01:33:34.441]  We have a little bit of the next hour.
[01:33:34.441 --> 01:33:35.922]  Then Roger Stone's going to be joining us.
[01:33:35.922 --> 01:33:39.964]  We're going to have Jakari Jackson, David Knight, Liam McAdoo, and myself.
[01:33:40.444 --> 01:33:58.081]  And that's the reason we have three studios really in here that we can go live from now because we have so many great crew members and reporters that just like Fox News or CNN or whatever, we've got our desk in there, they can get ready in another room, we can cut to them with breaking news, breaking analysis, we can cut to the other newsrooms, and we're hiring a couple more reporters, camera people, and...
[01:33:59.716 --> 01:34:22.848]  Writers, right now, as we tweak things to be able to really try to be able to cover world events, send reporters around the country and around the planet to really give you first looks and unfiltered analysis and live feeds, whether it be the Davos meeting or Bilderberg or the Republican DNC and RNCs that are coming up.
[01:34:24.261 --> 01:34:28.542]  And that's why it's more important than ever that you financially support InfoWars.
[01:34:28.542 --> 01:34:31.823]  We have the Hillary for Prison shirts for $19.95.
[01:34:31.823 --> 01:34:43.345]  All the profit of this next run of shirts, right through to the RNC and DNC, is going towards four flights a day, two days at the RNC, two days at the DNC, $35,000.
[01:34:43.345 --> 01:34:45.406]  It's $30,000 for the flights, $5,000 for the banners.
[01:34:45.406 --> 01:34:47.106]  We're going to have two different banners.
[01:34:51.187 --> 01:34:57.432]  These are giant banners, not just the regular size, the big, huge ones that say HillaryForPresidentInfoWars.com.
[01:34:57.432 --> 01:35:04.919]  Because, look, we're going to get justice in the court of public opinion regardless of what the compromise corrupt FBI leadership does or others.
[01:35:04.919 --> 01:35:07.341]  We know crimes when they're openly committed.
[01:35:07.341 --> 01:35:12.706]  Also, we're extending the 4th of July independence sale right through this week, but then it will end because
[01:35:13.286 --> 01:35:21.110]  We're not allowed to do that anymore with our water filter suppliers or with the storable food suppliers because this is the lowest you'll find anywhere.
[01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:27.713]  20 to 40% off storable foods that are already at the lowest price anywhere powered by MyPatriot Supply.
[01:35:27.713 --> 01:35:29.814]  It's info or select by private labeling.
[01:35:29.814 --> 01:35:31.095]  We can go even lower.
[01:35:31.095 --> 01:35:32.616]  That is the best deal you'll find anywhere.
[01:35:33.496 --> 01:35:36.900]  Also, 20% off Alexa Pure water filters.
[01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:41.605]  Also off their air purifiers and survival shield, Nascent Iodine X2.
[01:35:41.605 --> 01:35:44.689]  And there's also some other items on the site that are 20 to 40% off.
[01:35:44.689 --> 01:35:46.711]  Take advantage of the Independence Day sale.
[01:35:46.711 --> 01:35:47.712]  You do not want to be...
[01:35:49.514 --> 01:35:50.374]  Not self-sufficient.
[01:35:50.374 --> 01:35:53.016]  You do not want to be dependent on the globalists.
[01:35:53.016 --> 01:35:54.536]  You want to be independent.
[01:35:54.536 --> 01:35:58.779]  And the best thing we can do is pull out of the system more and more and be self-sufficient.
[01:35:58.779 --> 01:36:05.302]  So whether it's non-GMO heirloom seeds or the nutraceuticals at Infowarslife.com, it is now time to take action.
[01:36:05.302 --> 01:36:08.144]  And to be specific, Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[01:36:08.624 --> 01:36:09.004]  I think so.
[01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:37.932]  Or Living Defense, or Secret 12, or Brain Force, or the Joint and Bone Formulas, or Anthroplex, or Silver Bullet, or Knockout Sleep Aid.
[01:36:37.932 --> 01:36:42.534]  All of these are amazing products and are of the highest quality.
[01:36:42.534 --> 01:36:51.216]  That is our guarantee to you to only produce and sell products that we ourselves use and our families use and from our research are the very best and the cleanest out there.
[01:36:51.216 --> 01:36:55.758]  Now, shifting gears to our round table discussion and your phone calls.
[01:36:58.621 --> 01:37:12.155]  I detest Hillary Clinton, not because she's a woman, but because she's a monstrous creature that gets hundreds of millions of dollars, a hundred million alone, from the Saudis who are the most oppressive people and the most anti-liberal people in the world.
[01:37:12.155 --> 01:37:15.238]  And only by being a so-called liberal can she have the coverage.
[01:37:15.238 --> 01:37:18.901]  Donald Trump was taking hundreds of millions of dollars from Gulf state dictators.
[01:37:19.522 --> 01:37:24.504]  Where women are executed if they're caught, you know, having sex outside of marriage or whatever or gays.
[01:37:24.504 --> 01:37:26.264]  It's just insane.
[01:37:26.264 --> 01:37:29.305]  And then to see her get all this cover and the leftists make jokes, it's sick.
[01:37:29.305 --> 01:37:34.147]  And then her crimes on all of the different things she's done, it makes my head spin.
[01:37:34.147 --> 01:37:36.408]  So I want to go through the response.
[01:37:37.674 --> 01:37:46.662]  What what Lee and McAdoo felt and saw today as a journalist when she saw this unfold, then Jakari and David Knight, and then we'll also talk to the callers.
[01:37:46.662 --> 01:37:50.665]  And then I want to ask our roundtable, where do you think this is going next?
[01:37:50.665 --> 01:37:56.910]  Because I have never in the last few years had a sense of dread building up like I do now.
[01:37:56.910 --> 01:37:58.272]  And my gut's never wrong.
[01:37:58.272 --> 01:38:01.735]  And now it's gone from dread to just full on, oh,
[01:38:02.435 --> 01:38:04.917]  I mean, I just want her out of my life.
[01:38:04.917 --> 01:38:12.562]  It's like a bad neighbor, or a bad boss, or a bad employee, or a bad cousin, or a bad, you know, relative, whatever it is.
[01:38:12.562 --> 01:38:13.783]  You can get them out of your life.
[01:38:13.783 --> 01:38:15.664]  You can stop associating with them.
[01:38:15.664 --> 01:38:17.965]  They're called stalkers if they won't get out of your life.
[01:38:17.965 --> 01:38:23.849]  But I really have a visceral, bad feeling when I look at Hillary Clinton.
[01:38:23.849 --> 01:38:28.792]  Because I just, it's everything that's wrong with the world.
[01:38:28.792 --> 01:38:29.413]  Leanne McAdoo.
[01:38:30.071 --> 01:38:30.692]  I agree with you.
[01:38:30.692 --> 01:38:33.477]  I was filled with dread, anger.
[01:38:33.477 --> 01:38:34.559]  She disgusts me.
[01:38:34.559 --> 01:38:37.363]  To me, she is like an oozing pustule.
[01:38:37.363 --> 01:38:37.544]  Like a...
[01:38:38.604 --> 01:38:41.086]  Seeping bedsore, and someone needs to flip her over.
[01:38:41.086 --> 01:38:46.069]  I mean, she's so disgusting, she's decaying, and that's what she wants to do to this country.
[01:38:46.069 --> 01:38:55.956]  And the fact that the FBI director, the things that he said, he's just contradicting himself, saying that Clinton and her aides were extremely careless with the way they handled it.
[01:38:55.956 --> 01:38:58.738]  Yeah, they could care less about the rule of law.
[01:38:58.738 --> 01:39:00.479]  I was very careful to cut the tops off.
[01:39:01.035 --> 01:39:03.877]  Yeah, and then saying that they mishandled it.
[01:39:03.877 --> 01:39:08.001]  Well, why not at least charge her with mishandling classified information?
[01:39:08.001 --> 01:39:10.863]  You know, General Petraeus, the same thing happened to him.
[01:39:10.863 --> 01:39:14.065]  I mean, that's at least just a misdemeanor, but not even that.
[01:39:14.065 --> 01:39:17.028]  And to just say that they were careless with the way that they did it.
[01:39:17.028 --> 01:39:20.550]  Her aide admitted that they burned her daily schedule.
[01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:21.511]  Why?
[01:39:21.511 --> 01:39:24.393]  Who are you meeting with that you need to burn your schedule?
[01:39:25.273 --> 01:39:28.635]  And then the fact that they're destroying federal documents.
[01:39:28.635 --> 01:39:29.655]  And they know that they did that.
[01:39:29.655 --> 01:39:35.238]  And not to mention the fact that she certified under penalty of perjury that she fully complied with the court order.
[01:39:35.238 --> 01:39:38.319]  She handed over all of her official emails to the State Department.
[01:39:38.319 --> 01:39:42.261]  But we know again and again that that is absolutely false.
[01:39:42.261 --> 01:39:46.483]  She used it as a drop box for clandestine espionage.
[01:39:47.103 --> 01:39:53.347]  And then when we, this is what we found out during the Benghazi hearing, the Benghazi committee, which they said, oh, they didn't get her at all.
[01:39:53.347 --> 01:39:54.588]  What a waste of time.
[01:39:54.588 --> 01:39:56.489]  Well, so this was in October 2015.
[01:39:56.489 --> 01:40:02.913]  Secretary Clinton could not explain why she failed to turn over 15 Libya related emails.
[01:40:02.913 --> 01:40:03.894]  And her response is.
[01:40:04.714 --> 01:40:11.016]  I was under no obligation to make any of my emails available unless I decided they were work-related.
[01:40:11.016 --> 01:40:14.577]  Remember though, first she said a few years ago she didn't even have a server or other emails.
[01:40:14.577 --> 01:40:15.117]  Right.
[01:40:15.117 --> 01:40:17.357]  No, she said she only used one phone.
[01:40:17.357 --> 01:40:20.778]  Meanwhile, she's been photographed with multiple devices.
[01:40:20.778 --> 01:40:23.179]  And Kumi just says there's nothing there.
[01:40:24.508 --> 01:40:29.670]  That's what just makes me so angry is that now the president is flying her around on Air Force One.
[01:40:29.670 --> 01:40:32.271]  It's just an additional slap in the face to the American people.
[01:40:32.271 --> 01:40:33.672]  Millions of dollars a day.
[01:40:33.672 --> 01:40:39.955]  Not only are we not going to charge her with anything, she's going to get away with the crime, we're also going to fly her around on your dime.
[01:40:40.635 --> 01:40:44.256]  Because she's the exalted goddess, Hillary Clinton.
[01:40:44.256 --> 01:40:47.576]  But check this out, so this is what, I mean, explain this to me.
[01:40:47.576 --> 01:40:55.798]  So Comey says, to be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences.
[01:40:55.798 --> 01:41:03.479]  To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions, but that's not what we are deciding now.
[01:41:03.479 --> 01:41:06.920]  So if anybody else does what Hillary Clinton did, they'd be in big trouble.
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.041]  But not Hillary Clinton.
[01:41:09.041 --> 01:41:11.103]  Nope, she gets flown around on the Air Force One.
[01:41:11.103 --> 01:41:12.083]  It's this gimmick.
[01:41:12.083 --> 01:41:14.625]  It's the gimmick that she's a woman.
[01:41:14.625 --> 01:41:16.927]  It's just, this is who they want.
[01:41:16.927 --> 01:41:18.028]  It's her time.
[01:41:18.028 --> 01:41:19.049]  It's already been decided.
[01:41:19.049 --> 01:41:22.531]  They asked her to step down because it was Obama's time in the past.
[01:41:22.531 --> 01:41:23.852]  Now it is her time.
[01:41:23.852 --> 01:41:25.654]  And they'll do whatever they can.
[01:41:25.654 --> 01:41:26.595]  Here's my next question.
[01:41:26.595 --> 01:41:27.635]  Here's my next question.
[01:41:27.635 --> 01:41:29.437]  I'm going to Jakari.
[01:41:29.437 --> 01:41:33.400]  What does your intellectual but also your gut level tell you about what she'll do when she gets in?
[01:41:34.735 --> 01:41:36.476]  Well, I think Jerome Corsi nailed it.
[01:41:36.476 --> 01:41:42.698]  I mean, she is... We've had prophets say, you know, that Obama would be the last president.
[01:41:42.698 --> 01:41:45.079]  I truly feel like that could possibly happen.
[01:41:45.079 --> 01:41:48.580]  If she becomes the president, she will become a dictator.
[01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:51.161]  So many things will happen under her, and she's just gonna go...
[01:41:52.301 --> 01:41:54.544]  That's what Secret Service agent Byrne said on her last week.
[01:41:54.544 --> 01:41:56.366]  He said she wants a socialist dictatorship.
[01:41:56.366 --> 01:42:01.091]  Yeah, and all these people who over the weekend were hashtagging America was never great.
[01:42:01.091 --> 01:42:03.313]  You're going to get what you've asked for.
[01:42:03.313 --> 01:42:03.754]  Exactly.
[01:42:03.754 --> 01:42:05.816]  America has had a lot of problems.
[01:42:05.816 --> 01:42:06.537]  We talk about it.
[01:42:06.537 --> 01:42:09.120]  They don't even teach US history anymore except bad stuff.
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:10.602]  What about compared to all the other countries?
[01:42:10.602 --> 01:42:10.762]  Right.
[01:42:10.962 --> 01:42:15.304]  Because they only teach you what America did that was bad, why did everybody want to come here then?
[01:42:15.304 --> 01:42:23.967]  Because compared to other places, it was great in many ways, and its ideals helped lead the world in women's rights and in so many other issues.
[01:42:23.967 --> 01:42:34.551]  Now England led the world in ending slavery, and we were kind of late to the game in that, but I mean, it's just so crazy how these socialists holding up their smartphones and all this stuff, bitch about
[01:42:35.623 --> 01:42:41.872]  Everything when it's the ultra elite that are funding them to help overthrow the middle class so there's no way out.
[01:42:41.872 --> 01:42:44.836]  Jakari Jackson, your take on Hillary and where all this is going.
[01:42:45.612 --> 01:42:56.776]  Well just like that caller that you had on earlier in the show, I believe he said he was some kind of a defense contractor, and he said that he's not allowed to use the government information on his personal phone or send it to a personal email and all that.
[01:42:56.776 --> 01:43:10.542]  And you look at the actions of Mrs. Clinton, who's doing that exact same thing, and you contrast that with Guccifer or Bradley Manning or Snowden or Assange, all these guys who get this classified information, they want to run them through the wringer, but you have Mrs. Clinton
[01:43:10.802 --> 01:43:15.085]  Who's very much aware that she's not supposed to do this, because your caller knows that.
[01:43:15.085 --> 01:43:21.209]  Of course she has to know this, but she just gets away with it because she's Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[01:43:21.209 --> 01:43:22.310]  That's right.
[01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:26.733]  Jakari, what do you think she's going to pull once she gets in?
[01:43:26.733 --> 01:43:30.115]  Because we've already seen what they've done so far, and it seems like everything is accelerating.
[01:43:30.115 --> 01:43:30.996]  What do you think is going to happen?
[01:43:31.704 --> 01:43:33.645]  I think she's going to go a whole hog if she gets in there.
[01:43:33.645 --> 01:43:40.408]  She's going to try to pass everything that's been shot down, whether it's gun control or this new politically correct movement.
[01:43:40.408 --> 01:43:44.750]  I guess it's not new, but growing in strength, politically correct movement.
[01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:46.771]  She's going to do everything that she wants to do.
[01:43:46.771 --> 01:43:51.373]  She's going to keep telling these whopper lies about how she dodges sniper fire like she's Neo in the Matrix.
[01:43:51.673 --> 01:43:51.813]  I think?
[01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:19.505]  She talks to the Benghazi victims, she promises she's going to help them, and then when they come out and want some accountability, she calls them liars.
[01:44:19.505 --> 01:44:20.666]  She tells them to get over it.
[01:44:20.666 --> 01:44:27.851]  We had the article up just last week about the Benghazi widow who said, Mrs. Clinton, you said you're going to help me and now you're telling me to get over it?
[01:44:27.851 --> 01:44:32.534]  This is the type of action that we can expect from a President Clinton.
[01:44:32.534 --> 01:44:34.716]  Now, going to David Knight.
[01:44:34.716 --> 01:44:36.057]  David, let me ask you this question.
[01:44:39.685 --> 01:44:41.586]  What do you really think's going on here?
[01:44:41.586 --> 01:44:43.327]  Why is she so above the law?
[01:44:43.327 --> 01:44:44.707]  She looks like she's half-dead.
[01:44:44.707 --> 01:44:46.368]  Clinton looks like he's gonna die any minute.
[01:44:46.368 --> 01:44:47.428]  I mean, seriously.
[01:44:47.428 --> 01:44:56.292]  I said he was like a reanimated corpse a few years ago, out of Day of the Dead, but he looks like he's dying, like people I've seen that are, you know, a month away from dying of cancer.
[01:44:56.292 --> 01:44:59.854]  David Knight, why are the elite so behind him?
[01:44:59.854 --> 01:45:04.156]  They would put us to sleep if they put somebody younger in, or somebody who didn't have all this baggage.
[01:45:04.156 --> 01:45:07.157]  Is this just the arrogance of the elite, or what are they planning?
[01:45:08.257 --> 01:45:12.059]  Yeah, Alex, she's the only dog they've got in the fight at this moment.
[01:45:12.059 --> 01:45:13.800]  You know, we've had situations in the past.
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:17.162]  You look at four years ago, we had Obama and we had Romney.
[01:45:17.162 --> 01:45:19.344]  What they wanted then was Obamacare.
[01:45:19.344 --> 01:45:22.446]  They were going to get it whether they got Romney or Obama.
[01:45:22.446 --> 01:45:23.486]  And that's the way they like to play.
[01:45:23.486 --> 01:45:28.749]  They like to have two people on either side, this fake choice that they present.
[01:45:28.749 --> 01:45:30.370]  That's what Carol Quigley said in Tragedy and Hope.
[01:45:30.370 --> 01:45:35.153]  He said, we just have two different parties, but really they're closely tied, so we get the same agenda regardless.
[01:45:35.153 --> 01:45:36.094]  But Trump obsessed that.
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:42.105]  And you see that the establishment elite and both parties are very concerned about Trump.
[01:45:42.105 --> 01:45:44.807]  They want to do anything, no matter how blatant it is.
[01:45:44.807 --> 01:45:49.211]  And Alex, as I pointed out on Sunday, this was an orchestrated cover-up.
[01:45:49.211 --> 01:45:50.312]  We could see this developing.
[01:45:50.312 --> 01:46:00.442]  And I knew, and I said it on Sunday, I said, look, if you had any doubts as to whether or not she's going to get indicted, look at the fact that they scheduled the FBI meeting on the Saturday around the 4th of July weekend.
[01:46:01.002 --> 01:46:10.466]  That's, other than, like, the last Saturday before Christmas, that's the only time they could pick where there'd be fewer people paying attention to this.
[01:46:10.466 --> 01:46:12.127]  And that's precisely what they've done.
[01:46:12.127 --> 01:46:14.888]  If you look at it a week ago, we had the Snakes on a Plane meeting.
[01:46:14.888 --> 01:46:17.149]  And she says, well, it was just personal information.
[01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:18.150]  Look, we understand.
[01:46:18.710 --> 01:46:22.354]  That Attorney General Lynch is a close personal friend of Bill Clinton.
[01:46:22.354 --> 01:46:32.744]  That's why she should have recused herself even before this meeting, which violated every ethical standard that the American Bar Association or any other legal group would have there.
[01:46:32.744 --> 01:46:34.426]  She had a close personal relationship.
[01:46:34.426 --> 01:46:36.568]  She had a close working relationship with him.
[01:46:36.568 --> 01:46:39.351]  He is the one who gave her all of her big career breaks.
[01:46:39.351 --> 01:46:41.333]  They had a close political relationship.
[01:46:41.793 --> 01:46:45.017]  Those are the three tests as to whether or not you should recuse yourself.
[01:46:45.017 --> 01:46:46.399]  Check all three boxes.
[01:46:46.399 --> 01:46:49.844]  That's key, but plus they had the FBI order the cameras turned off.
[01:46:49.844 --> 01:46:53.368]  I want to go back to you David Jakari on this, but let me ask Leanne this question.
[01:46:53.368 --> 01:46:54.590]  Why have the meeting?
[01:46:54.590 --> 01:46:56.071]  Why try to cover it up?
[01:46:56.071 --> 01:46:58.575]  Then why to try to act like it's no big deal once they did it?
[01:46:58.575 --> 01:46:59.135]  I gotta tell you.
[01:46:59.736 --> 01:47:01.217]  It's like they did it on purpose.
[01:47:01.217 --> 01:47:05.521]  They know how to secretly meet and not have to be on a tarmac in front of 50 reporters.
[01:47:05.521 --> 01:47:09.364]  When Lynch was one of the hottest interviews at the time, being chased around.
[01:47:09.364 --> 01:47:11.246]  Why are they doing this?
[01:47:11.246 --> 01:47:13.127]  Nichols knew them well, put them in power.
[01:47:13.127 --> 01:47:15.069]  He said, they want to break our will.
[01:47:16.112 --> 01:47:16.792]  I agree.
[01:47:16.792 --> 01:47:17.173]  I agree.
[01:47:17.173 --> 01:47:20.474]  And that's how I feel like my will is broken.
[01:47:20.474 --> 01:47:22.075]  They put it out in your face.
[01:47:22.075 --> 01:47:29.239]  They even leaked conveniently that Hillary Clinton is considering keeping Loretta Lynch on as the Attorney General if she gets elected.
[01:47:29.239 --> 01:47:36.483]  It's like they're just putting out this information to just show us how above the law they are and how we're powerless.
[01:47:36.483 --> 01:47:37.823]  They can do whatever they want.
[01:47:37.823 --> 01:47:39.404]  The rules don't apply to them.
[01:47:39.404 --> 01:47:42.686]  Jakari, do you think it's that or do you think we're reading more into it?
[01:47:42.686 --> 01:47:44.427]  It's crazy how arrogant they are.
[01:47:45.228 --> 01:47:49.611]  I think they honestly feel that they are above the law, and to an extent they have proved that.
[01:47:49.611 --> 01:47:55.355]  It's to a point now where they're just going to do anything they want because they know that nothing's going to happen to them.
[01:47:55.355 --> 01:47:58.537]  They're just going to come out there with the media machine, the politically correct machine.
[01:47:58.537 --> 01:48:00.058]  You hate Hillary because she's a woman.
[01:48:00.058 --> 01:48:01.979]  You don't want to see the first woman president.
[01:48:01.979 --> 01:48:02.779]  That's all they have.
[01:48:02.779 --> 01:48:08.523]  And to go on what David was talking about, Lynch's personal relationship as it comes to the Clintons.
[01:48:08.523 --> 01:48:14.587]  Okay, maybe they are close personal friends in real life, but if you get selected for jury duty and you know the accused,
[01:48:14.867 --> 01:48:16.728]  You're not going to get selected for that jury.
[01:48:16.728 --> 01:48:17.309]  It's just that simple.
[01:48:17.309 --> 01:48:18.069]  Exactly.
[01:48:18.069 --> 01:48:23.132]  Meanwhile, they have them running around investigating them, and they're hanging out talking about supposedly golf.
[01:48:23.132 --> 01:48:24.693]  Well, she offered that as an excuse.
[01:48:24.693 --> 01:48:25.894]  Yeah, it's not an excuse.
[01:48:25.894 --> 01:48:29.937]  It's a reason that she shouldn't have even still been in that position as a prosecutor or a judge.
[01:48:29.937 --> 01:48:30.557]  It's called the rule.
[01:48:30.557 --> 01:48:41.864]  If you're a judge, a prosecutor, or a witness in a trial or in a criminal case, you don't talk to the other people outside of court or a registered, you know, police interrogation room.
[01:48:41.864 --> 01:48:43.025]  You do not talk to them.
[01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:46.401]  I mean, what do we do at this point?
[01:48:46.401 --> 01:48:47.862]  How do we let this stand?
[01:48:47.862 --> 01:48:48.642]  I mean, that's what it is.
[01:48:48.642 --> 01:48:53.104]  They're breaking our will to let us see that we are completely powerless, but we're not powerless.
[01:48:53.104 --> 01:48:55.405]  How do we change this?
[01:48:55.405 --> 01:48:56.506]  That's a good question, David.
[01:48:56.506 --> 01:48:57.466]  I mean, how do you think we changed it?
[01:48:57.466 --> 01:49:00.648]  I mean, I think in the court of public opinion, we destroy these people.
[01:49:00.648 --> 01:49:05.450]  We don't just lay down and have them break our will, just like they tried to break our will with the British exit.
[01:49:05.450 --> 01:49:06.711]  We just go to the next level.
[01:49:06.711 --> 01:49:07.591]  They're never going to give up.
[01:49:07.591 --> 01:49:08.311]  We're never going to give up.
[01:49:08.311 --> 01:49:09.472]  And that's what we have to understand.
[01:49:09.472 --> 01:49:11.053]  This is the animating contest of liberty, David.
[01:49:11.633 --> 01:49:17.357]  As we were talking about this morning, Alex, it is really their declaration of independence of the rule of law.
[01:49:17.357 --> 01:49:26.083]  Because as we saw last week, not only did she not recuse herself, as I pointed out, because of these close personal relationships, but then they did it in our face, as you're pointing out, with a declaration.
[01:49:26.083 --> 01:49:29.566]  Then, the day that we learned about that, which was two days later, last Wednesday,
[01:49:30.046 --> 01:49:33.750]  They come out and say, we're not going to release any emails for at least 27 months.
[01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:38.916]  That was something the State Department wanted and that was something the Department of Justice under Lynch said we're not going to do.
[01:49:38.916 --> 01:49:43.561]  Then we find out they're going to hold this meeting at the time that nobody's going to pay attention to it.
[01:49:43.561 --> 01:49:50.149]  When I heard that they were having, the FBI was going to have the meeting today on Hillary Clinton, I told my wife, I said, that's it.
[01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:52.290]  They're not going to do anything at all to her.
[01:49:52.290 --> 01:50:03.294]  But then when he started to talk about this, Alex, and he started to lay out all the details of what they had to do with their investigation, how they found 110 classified emails, and that was a felony, I said, I can't believe this.
[01:50:03.294 --> 01:50:04.974]  Sounds like he's going to indict her.
[01:50:04.974 --> 01:50:09.096]  And then he does a complete 180 again and says, you know, they're felonies, but we don't really care.
[01:50:09.096 --> 01:50:10.376]  Just don't try this at home.
[01:50:10.376 --> 01:50:10.837]  That's what he said.
[01:50:10.837 --> 01:50:12.397]  They're covering Obama.
[01:50:12.397 --> 01:50:13.898]  They're covering for Obama.
[01:50:13.898 --> 01:50:16.599]  He won't even have to do a Nixonian pardon.
[01:50:17.318 --> 01:50:17.979]  Yeah.
[01:50:17.979 --> 01:50:22.562]  They're not even going to have to do a pardon because they're just going to have the bureaucracy pardon you now.
[01:50:22.562 --> 01:50:25.424]  This is really almost a coup of the bureaucracy.
[01:50:25.424 --> 01:50:30.789]  This means if you can get in as the Attorney General or the head of the FBI, you run the country pretty much.
[01:50:30.789 --> 01:50:32.730]  This is way beyond J. Edgar Hoover at this point.
[01:50:32.730 --> 01:50:35.192]  Stay there guys, I'm going to go right to the calls here.
[01:50:35.192 --> 01:50:39.756]  Brady, Sargent, Shane, Vincent, Denise, your call straight ahead, your comments.

[01:50:46.881 --> 01:50:47.762]  Is the recession really over?
[01:50:47.762 --> 01:50:48.723]  Is a bigger one on the way?
[01:50:48.723 --> 01:50:52.025]  Will our next president lead us to prosperity and peace?
[01:50:52.025 --> 01:50:53.646]  Or will it all fall apart?
[01:50:53.646 --> 01:50:56.869]  Our modern world is unpredictable and unstable.
[01:50:56.869 --> 01:50:58.590]  Are you ready for what comes next?

[01:52:59.269 --> 01:53:01.111]  This is Michael David from Seattle.
[01:53:01.111 --> 01:53:06.975]  I'm 51 years old, and six months ago, I started taking Andro 400 to increase my testosterone.
[01:53:06.975 --> 01:53:12.500]  Since then, I've lost 35 pounds of fat, and my waist went from size 38 to size 32.
[01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:15.863]  I have more energy, and I look and feel 20 years younger.
[01:53:15.863 --> 01:53:18.785]  And now, my wife tells me I have to take Andro 400.
[01:53:18.785 --> 01:53:21.447]  Hi, this is Ron Johnson from Utah.
[01:53:21.447 --> 01:53:25.751]  After 10 weeks of taking Andro 400, I lost 13 pounds, and my waist went from 36 to 33.
[01:53:25.751 --> 01:53:26.692]  That was 8 years ago.
[01:53:28.533 --> 01:53:33.016]  I continue to take Andro-400 and I've maintained my weight at 172.
[01:53:33.016 --> 01:53:34.497]  Gained muscle and energy.
[01:53:34.497 --> 01:53:37.999]  I'm 63 now and feel better than I have in 30 years.
[01:53:37.999 --> 01:53:39.300]  Andro-400.
[01:53:39.300 --> 01:53:44.764]  The natural way to increase testosterone, lose belly fat, gain energy and feel great.
[01:53:44.764 --> 01:53:46.225]  Try Andro-400.
[01:53:46.225 --> 01:53:49.927]  The safe, effective, affordable way to boost your testosterone.
[01:53:49.927 --> 01:53:51.008]  Go to andro400.com or call 888-400-0435.
[01:53:58.353 --> 01:53:58.517]  Guys.
[01:54:08.488 --> 01:54:16.154]  We're extending the 4th of July Independence Day sales on 20-40% off of storable foods, water filters, you name it, and then Fort WorthStore.com.
[01:54:16.154 --> 01:54:17.555]  Be sure to take advantage of that.
[01:54:17.555 --> 01:54:21.778]  One thing I can do is just get ready myself and fight as hard as I can to wake people up.
[01:54:21.778 --> 01:54:24.900]  We're doing a roundtable discussion here in a little bit in the next hour.
[01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:28.243]  Then Roger Stone joins us with a lot of breaking news on the Clinton crime family.
[01:54:28.763 --> 01:54:31.063]  Hi guys, I basically share the same frustration
[01:54:57.566 --> 01:55:00.567]  From the FBI's comments this morning.
[01:55:00.567 --> 01:55:03.468]  But I also had a thought going forward.
[01:55:03.468 --> 01:55:14.851]  I'm wondering, even after the liberal media and the Democrats have criticized the Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch meeting, do you think Bernie Sanders will still sell out?
[01:55:15.791 --> 01:55:17.252]  And endorse Hillary?
[01:55:17.252 --> 01:55:18.352]  Absolutely.
[01:55:18.352 --> 01:55:19.152]  He's a socialist.
[01:55:19.152 --> 01:55:20.353]  He wants to gut this country.
[01:55:20.353 --> 01:55:21.433]  He hates it.
[01:55:21.433 --> 01:55:26.555]  He wants to see it brought down so him and his little commissars can divvy up the money and sit there in their duchies.
[01:55:26.555 --> 01:55:28.316]  And that's how this always works.
[01:55:28.316 --> 01:55:29.457]  These are predators.
[01:55:29.457 --> 01:55:31.237]  I mean, I believe he is a predator.
[01:55:31.237 --> 01:55:34.439]  He says a lot of stuff that sounds good on the surface, but he's a hardcore predator.
[01:55:34.439 --> 01:55:37.900]  When it comes time to him to really go up the federal reserve stuff, he doesn't.
[01:55:37.900 --> 01:55:39.601]  So that's my view on Sanders.
[01:55:39.601 --> 01:55:40.721]  What do you think?
[01:55:40.721 --> 01:55:41.522]  What do you think, Jakari?
[01:55:41.522 --> 01:55:42.202]  What do you think, David?
[01:55:43.203 --> 01:55:45.045]  Well I agree with what you said right there.
[01:55:45.045 --> 01:55:58.978]  When you have a guy like Bernie Sanders, of course he's not exactly happy as to what happened between him and Clinton in the primaries, but at the end of the day he's going to support that party because it's the closest thing to the socialist utopia that he'd like to see happen.
[01:55:58.978 --> 01:55:59.158]  Right.
[01:55:59.338 --> 01:56:05.584]  Yeah, I think he was waiting in the wings, Alex, to see if they're going to indict Hillary Clinton and if that was going to change things at the Democrat Party.
[01:56:05.584 --> 01:56:07.266]  But I don't think he ever had a chance.
[01:56:07.266 --> 01:56:10.148]  The Democrat leadership would not have given this to him.
[01:56:10.148 --> 01:56:12.010]  I think they would have put in Joe Biden.
[01:56:12.010 --> 01:56:12.931]  I think they're that corrupt.
[01:56:12.931 --> 01:56:14.412]  Yeah, it's a Politburo cult.
[01:56:14.412 --> 01:56:16.154]  They're the central committee and now they admit that.
[01:56:16.154 --> 01:56:19.958]  They just appoint who the nominees are and Trump's not playing along, so the fix is in.
[01:56:20.759 --> 01:56:21.079]  That's right.
[01:56:21.079 --> 01:56:22.960]  And you're talking about what's going to happen next.
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:27.522]  We understand what's going to happen next because we've seen what they have done coming after whistleblowers.
[01:56:27.522 --> 01:56:29.683]  Look at the case of Thomas Drake, for example.
[01:56:29.683 --> 01:56:33.244]  Again, saying that he had classified emails on his computer, which he didn't.
[01:56:33.244 --> 01:56:38.226]  But they tried to put him away for 35 years, and we'll talk about that in detail later today.
[01:56:38.226 --> 01:56:39.627]  Yeah, in the fourth hour.
[01:56:39.627 --> 01:56:41.268]  By the way, they SWAT teamed.
[01:56:42.148 --> 01:56:43.629]  They swat-teamed Benny.
[01:56:43.629 --> 01:56:44.590]  That's right.
[01:56:44.590 --> 01:56:46.331]  I mean, this...Leon... That's right.
[01:56:46.331 --> 01:56:48.833]  They trumped up charges against these people when they hadn't done anything.
[01:56:48.833 --> 01:56:55.357]  That's what Hillary Clinton will do, whatever she wants, but she will punish her enemies just as we've seen them try to punish these NSA... That's right.
[01:56:55.357 --> 01:57:01.622]  Leon McAdoo, when you were around Austin, and I'm guessing you talked to some so-called liberals, I've been thinking you was like a real liberal libertarian.
[01:57:01.622 --> 01:57:02.623]  Correct me if I'm wrong, but you know, we're...
[01:57:03.643 --> 01:57:06.505]  Pretty much politically on the same page as common sense freedom.
[01:57:06.505 --> 01:57:09.227]  When you're talking to liberals, I mean, I know some of them are supporting Hillary.
[01:57:09.227 --> 01:57:12.409]  I don't find many, which really shows what a hoax this is.
[01:57:12.409 --> 01:57:13.469]  Why are they supporting her?
[01:57:13.469 --> 01:57:14.510]  Or can you even find anybody?
[01:57:15.302 --> 01:57:29.011]  Well, I try very hard to not be around people who support Hillary Clinton, but if I do happen to run into that one odd fellow or female out there, how do you gaslight yourself?
[01:57:29.011 --> 01:57:38.117]  How do you sit there and say that her crimes are excusable, that she could actually be the next president of the United States of America just because she's a woman?
[01:57:39.798 --> 01:57:42.622]  As a woman, do you want the first woman president to be that lady?
[01:57:42.622 --> 01:57:43.043]  I would not.
[01:57:43.043 --> 01:57:43.944]  We deserve better.
[01:57:43.944 --> 01:57:45.386]  As a woman, I deserve better.
[01:57:45.386 --> 01:57:48.751]  I deserve a better representative to be the first female president.
[01:57:51.261 --> 01:57:59.468]  Are the left, just like Venezuela in places so dumb, when everything collapses, in 5-10 years, they won't even know why it happened.
[01:57:59.468 --> 01:58:00.989]  They'll just call for more socialism.
[01:58:00.989 --> 01:58:01.910]  Well, and that's what it is.
[01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:11.317]  It's like they're dumbing us down and they're just breaking our will to the point where people are just bending and they're saying, well, she's totally corrupt and she's proven that she's above the law.
[01:58:11.317 --> 01:58:14.540]  They come right out and say, if anyone else does it, they're going to go to jail.
[01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:15.721]  She's fine.
[01:58:15.721 --> 01:58:16.862]  Caller, anything else you want to add?
[01:58:18.584 --> 01:58:19.084]  Caller's gone.
[01:58:19.084 --> 01:58:21.306]  I'm gonna go right back and he's been holding the longest after that.
[01:58:21.306 --> 01:58:28.912]  Vincent, then Denise Sargent and others, Jakari Jackson and David Knight riding shotgun with us a bit more.
[01:58:28.912 --> 01:58:33.596]  Straight ahead and then they'll be back in the fourth hour today.
[01:58:33.596 --> 01:58:36.378]  And we've also got some other special guests joining us.
[01:58:36.378 --> 01:58:37.158]  Stay with us.
[01:58:37.158 --> 01:58:38.960]  Please spread the word about this feed.
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:41.061]  Audio feeds, local stations, however you're listening to us.
[01:58:41.061 --> 01:58:42.583]  They don't want folks to hear this.
[01:58:42.583 --> 01:58:43.643]  Please don't take it for granted.
[01:58:43.643 --> 01:58:44.164]  GCN.
[01:58:44.164 --> 01:58:46.706]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.057 --> 01:58:51.699]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:58:51.699 --> 01:58:53.182]  You can't survive without it.
[01:58:53.182 --> 01:58:54.383]  But where do you get it?
[01:58:54.383 --> 01:59:00.372]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:59:00.372 --> 01:59:06.100]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[01:59:52.532 --> 01:59:55.117]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:13.837 --> 02:00:20.343]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.343 --> 02:00:25.107]  Alright, I'll continue with calls after our roundtable leaves us here in about five minutes.
[02:00:25.107 --> 02:00:29.391]  And of course, Roger Stone's coming on with a lot of breaking news.
[02:00:29.391 --> 02:00:31.913]  But we're going to your calls right now as well.
[02:00:31.913 --> 02:00:34.855]  Let's talk to Vincent in Washington.
[02:00:34.855 --> 02:00:35.756]  You're on the air, Vincent.
[02:00:35.756 --> 02:00:41.321]  What's your comment on the whole FBI not calling for an indictment of the invincible Hillary?
[02:00:42.705 --> 02:00:45.546]  Hey, Alex, how's it going, man?
[02:00:45.546 --> 02:00:55.390]  I tell you what, I am so speechless at the corruption and criminal activity that's going on by the government.
[02:00:55.390 --> 02:01:02.272]  And so many times you talk about, you know, it's like Twilight Zone.
[02:01:02.272 --> 02:01:05.414]  These people are doing stuff right in people's faces.
[02:01:05.414 --> 02:01:11.416]  And it's like the majority of the country is so brainwashed
[02:01:14.899 --> 02:01:16.801]  It's like right in your face.
[02:01:16.801 --> 02:01:18.162]  They don't care.
[02:01:18.162 --> 02:01:19.904]  And people act like it's just normal.
[02:01:19.904 --> 02:01:21.205]  Well that's what I'm getting from the listeners.
[02:01:21.205 --> 02:01:21.866]  It's the same thing.
[02:01:21.866 --> 02:01:23.928]  Just flabbergasted.
[02:01:23.928 --> 02:01:28.011]  We know she lied and said she didn't have the server, didn't have the email, had one device.
[02:01:28.011 --> 02:01:30.614]  We know she ordered them to cut the classified tops off.
[02:01:30.614 --> 02:01:33.136]  We know everybody's saying she should be indicted.
[02:01:33.136 --> 02:01:35.699]  And it's just, then you ask, what else is she going to get away with?
[02:01:35.699 --> 02:01:37.881]  Good, same point everybody's making, Vincent.
[02:01:37.881 --> 02:01:38.721]  I appreciate your call.
[02:01:38.721 --> 02:01:39.122]  Anything else?
[02:01:40.216 --> 02:01:53.141]  Yeah, just, you know, Comey basically just said, like David Knight said, the political elite has given their declaration of independence from the law.
[02:01:53.141 --> 02:01:54.781]  They don't have to obey it.
[02:01:54.781 --> 02:01:55.801]  We do.
[02:01:55.801 --> 02:01:59.043]  And a quick thing on the gun grab.
[02:01:59.043 --> 02:02:02.704]  You know how the California governor, he signed all those gun laws.
[02:02:02.704 --> 02:02:05.105]  They're stripping the guns from the state of California.
[02:02:05.105 --> 02:02:07.265]  It's becoming a communist state.
[02:02:07.265 --> 02:02:08.586]  And then on top of that,
[02:02:09.289 --> 02:02:09.709]  I forgot that.
[02:02:09.709 --> 02:02:10.490]  I saw that last week.
[02:02:18.900 --> 02:02:20.221]  That's what I mean!
[02:02:20.221 --> 02:02:24.864]  It's like literal, they are tax exempt like in the EU, they can have guns, nobody else can.
[02:02:24.864 --> 02:02:26.165]  It's new royalty.
[02:02:26.165 --> 02:02:29.847]  Jakari, I think, thank you so much Vincent.
[02:02:29.847 --> 02:02:31.087]  Jakari, I think it comes down to this.
[02:02:31.087 --> 02:02:37.191]  This is not just a declaration of independence against the law, it's a political revolution of the new royalty.
[02:02:37.191 --> 02:02:40.213]  I mean, I think that's what this is, I think it's what we call this.
[02:02:40.213 --> 02:02:41.614]  Final comments from Jakari and David Knight.
[02:02:42.054 --> 02:02:50.176]  Well, they are acting as if they're royal because they want a separate, as the caller was saying right there, they want a separate set of rules for themselves and the little people.
[02:02:50.176 --> 02:03:00.199]  You know, they have, they go to these buildings, you know, I want everybody to understand when you see these, these senators, these congressmen, these presidents, even your local city council saying, we want to ban guns, we want to get rid of guns.
[02:03:00.199 --> 02:03:04.140]  They work in a building nine to five with taxpayer funded armed security.
[02:03:04.140 --> 02:03:06.461]  I'm sure they feel very safe when they go to work in the morning.
[02:03:06.781 --> 02:03:14.092]  I'm talking about for everybody else in the country, if you work the graveyard shift in a bad part of town, you may need a little something something to protect yourself.
[02:03:14.092 --> 02:03:18.959]  Well that's what makes this country so great, is the fact that we are given the right to defend ourselves and our families.
[02:03:18.959 --> 02:03:20.882]  We're one of the only countries that haven't taken the right, David.
[02:03:21.584 --> 02:03:30.874]  As the laws become more draconian, Alex, on us, on the individual citizens, as they become more unconstitutional, they give more immunity to themselves.
[02:03:30.874 --> 02:03:34.898]  Think about the fact that we had Nixon and Clinton impeached, okay?
[02:03:34.898 --> 02:03:38.061]  Both of these were, people would say they were relatively minor charges.
[02:03:38.061 --> 02:03:41.245]  Nixon obstructed justice and Clinton committed perjury, okay?
[02:03:41.245 --> 02:03:42.206]  That's what they were impeached for.
[02:03:42.766 --> 02:03:43.827]  That was the pattern back then.
[02:03:43.827 --> 02:03:46.410]  Now they're saying, don't touch me.
[02:03:46.410 --> 02:03:56.138]  And of course, under Clinton, you had the CIA director, John Deutch, who did essentially the same thing, and he was not only indicted, but convicted, and then pardoned by Bill Clinton.
[02:03:56.138 --> 02:03:58.580]  Don't tell me that Clinton didn't know what was going on with us.
[02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:00.962]  Final question, 20 seconds from each.
[02:04:00.962 --> 02:04:03.685]  Now they're above the law, what's the next shoe to drop?
[02:04:06.885 --> 02:04:09.107]  I agree that they're going to come after their political enemies.
[02:04:09.107 --> 02:04:10.349]  They've already been doing that.
[02:04:10.349 --> 02:04:12.751]  We've seen how they focus.
[02:04:12.751 --> 02:04:14.713]  No one is going to be exempt from this.
[02:04:14.713 --> 02:04:18.737]  Even the leftist media is now going, whoa, wait a minute.
[02:04:18.737 --> 02:04:19.538]  What have we done?
[02:04:19.538 --> 02:04:20.740]  Hillary's a monster.
[02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:22.501]  Everyone's protecting her.
[02:04:22.501 --> 02:04:24.944]  They're complicit in this.
[02:04:24.944 --> 02:04:26.606]  Where are people's instincts, David Jacquard?
[02:04:27.813 --> 02:04:38.302]  Well, you know, Alex, Thomas Drake, who I interviewed once, he said, in 2010, he said, what I didn't realize at the time was that he was the opening shot in the Obama administration's war on whistleblowers.
[02:04:38.302 --> 02:04:40.183]  He said they were way beyond what Bush did.
[02:04:40.183 --> 02:04:43.806]  Bush merely threatened, he said, he actually came after his predecessor in jail.
[02:04:43.806 --> 02:04:44.527]  What's the next shooter drop?
[02:04:44.527 --> 02:04:45.528]  Censorship of the media.
[02:04:45.528 --> 02:04:46.629]  Censorship of the media.
[02:04:46.629 --> 02:04:53.695]  Well, they don't really need it because they have enough of the media in their pocket, but for everybody else, InfoWars.com, other ones out there, I'm pretty sure they'll come after us pretty hard.
[02:04:54.235 --> 02:04:55.116]  That's right.
[02:04:55.116 --> 02:04:55.857]  That's right, folks.
[02:04:55.857 --> 02:04:56.578]  We'll be back.
[02:04:56.578 --> 02:04:57.378]  Great job, crew.
[02:04:57.378 --> 02:04:57.959]  Stay with us.
[02:04:57.959 --> 02:04:58.540]  More callers.
[02:04:58.540 --> 02:05:00.021]  We'll get back to you.
[02:05:00.021 --> 02:05:00.962]  Let's face it.
[02:05:00.962 --> 02:05:03.665]  Most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones.
[02:05:03.665 --> 02:05:08.450]  But recent studies link cell phone use to major health issues, including brain cancer.
[02:05:08.450 --> 02:05:12.194]  Experts say parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful.
[02:05:12.194 --> 02:05:16.319]  Doctors say the infant brain, even while in the womb, is especially vulnerable.
[02:05:16.459 --> 02:05:20.763]  So keep the phone away from your abdomen, especially toward the end of pregnancy.
[02:05:20.763 --> 02:05:30.934]  And for men, using a cell phone for as little as an hour a day is literally cooking your sperm, lowering sperm count levels so much that conceiving a child could be difficult.
[02:05:30.934 --> 02:05:33.176]  This is one of those times you want to keep it out of your pants.
[02:05:33.556 --> 02:05:38.999]  And for those of us who use our cell phones before bed, know that the screen light is actually disrupting your sleep rhythms.
[02:05:38.999 --> 02:05:41.660]  This causes insomnia and slows the metabolism.
[02:05:41.660 --> 02:05:42.941]  Hello, weight gain!
[02:05:42.941 --> 02:05:48.044]  Generally speaking, when cell phones are on, they're constantly emitting radio frequency radiation.
[02:05:48.044 --> 02:05:50.325]  So keep your phone in airplane mode when you can.
[02:05:50.325 --> 02:05:52.926]  Keep the phone at least two feet away from your body.
[02:05:52.926 --> 02:05:53.867]  Use headphones.
[02:05:53.867 --> 02:05:57.189]  And when you're not on your phone, keep it as far away from you as possible.
[02:05:57.189 --> 02:05:59.230]  Leigh Ann McAdoo with your InfoWars Tip of the Week.

[02:06:57.638 --> 02:07:01.841]  BrainForce, it's completely different.
[02:07:01.841 --> 02:07:03.082]  Try a bottle of it.
[02:07:03.082 --> 02:07:04.663]  Rob Dew joins us.
[02:07:04.663 --> 02:07:07.765]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[02:07:07.765 --> 02:07:08.846]  Tell us what BrainForce did.
[02:07:08.846 --> 02:07:09.807]  I've been working all day.
[02:07:09.807 --> 02:07:12.308]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[02:07:12.308 --> 02:07:13.729]  I get in here at 830.
[02:07:13.729 --> 02:07:15.631]  I was kind of run down.
[02:07:15.631 --> 02:07:17.412]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[02:07:17.552 --> 02:07:19.453]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[02:07:19.453 --> 02:07:21.274]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[02:07:21.274 --> 02:07:22.314]  I popped two of them.
[02:07:22.314 --> 02:07:24.595]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[02:07:24.595 --> 02:07:26.396]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[02:07:26.396 --> 02:07:28.056]  It's got four and a half stars.
[02:07:28.056 --> 02:07:29.377]  People really love it.
[02:07:29.377 --> 02:07:29.997]  Read about it.
[02:07:29.997 --> 02:07:33.819]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[02:07:33.819 --> 02:07:39.081]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[02:07:39.301 --> 02:07:43.323]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without BrainForce.
[02:07:43.323 --> 02:07:49.466]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more BrainForce and came in.
[02:07:49.466 --> 02:07:55.389]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:10.828 --> 02:08:18.997]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones!
[02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:27.545]  Yep, from the former United States of America in occupied FEMA Region 6, formerly Texas.
[02:08:27.545 --> 02:08:29.466]  I mean, it's really true.
[02:08:29.466 --> 02:08:30.426]  We're under world government.
[02:08:30.426 --> 02:08:31.867]  It's all being announced.
[02:08:31.867 --> 02:08:32.948]  The Brexit has come out.
[02:08:32.948 --> 02:08:35.110]  They've said, look, we don't care if England leaves.
[02:08:35.110 --> 02:08:36.170]  We're just going to keep you in there.
[02:08:36.170 --> 02:08:40.873]  And we're going to dissolve nation armies and merge all the countries now so you can't ever escape.
[02:08:41.914 --> 02:08:42.935]  We are totalitarian.
[02:08:42.935 --> 02:08:44.317]  We are authoritarian.
[02:08:44.317 --> 02:08:45.278]  They're actually saying that.
[02:08:45.278 --> 02:08:46.059]  That's in the news.
[02:08:46.059 --> 02:08:47.561]  We've written articles about it.
[02:08:47.561 --> 02:08:50.244]  We've covered it in the last week.
[02:08:50.244 --> 02:08:51.185]  It's just amazing.
[02:08:51.185 --> 02:08:56.751]  But see, tyrants always get delusional when the people start to say no and try to double and triple down.
[02:08:57.611 --> 02:09:06.800]  And I think the FBI director saying Hillary's above the law now, coming out and saying we can't indict her, there's not enough evidence, no one would indict her when there's dozens of reasons to indict her.
[02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:12.305]  Lying, being caught lying, classified information, ordering the tops of the classified stuff cut off.
[02:09:12.305 --> 02:09:14.267]  This really is the demarcation line.
[02:09:15.031 --> 02:09:17.813]  I mean, I'm 100% in for Trump now.
[02:09:17.813 --> 02:09:23.157]  I halfway held my nose about a year ago, knowing he was a patriot and a good guy, but disagreeing with some of the stuff he did.
[02:09:23.157 --> 02:09:24.258]  Well, now he's a nationalist.
[02:09:24.258 --> 02:09:25.659]  He's got incredible courage.
[02:09:25.659 --> 02:09:26.640]  He's gone all out.
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:29.842]  They're coming after him with the controlled media.
[02:09:29.842 --> 02:09:34.005]  He's not getting any big establishment money, just more of an endorsement.
[02:09:34.005 --> 02:09:34.786]  I'm 100% now behind Donald Trump.
[02:09:37.662 --> 02:09:39.145]  I'm all in.
[02:09:39.145 --> 02:09:50.264]  And this is an epic moment, folks, where never in modern American history, really in 240 years, we celebrated our birthday yesterday, have I seen anything this naked.
[02:09:51.263 --> 02:09:52.965]  My head is spinning.
[02:09:52.965 --> 02:09:54.506]  My resolve is stronger than ever.
[02:09:54.506 --> 02:09:55.807]  It's the best of times, worst of times.
[02:09:55.807 --> 02:09:56.928]  People are waking up.
[02:09:56.928 --> 02:09:58.410]  Good things are happening.
[02:09:58.410 --> 02:09:59.291]  Big announcement here.
[02:09:59.291 --> 02:10:12.663]  Cleveland just backed off for the second time and said, OK, you can have your rallies, you can have your pro-Trump events that I and Roger Stone and Jay Morgan and Diamonds and Silk and Ralph King and so many others are going to be speaking at.
[02:10:13.584 --> 02:10:24.817]  United Women for Trump, Millennials for Trump, Students for Trump, Truckers for Trump, Tea Partiers for Trump, Bikers for Trump, Vets for Trump, Info Wars, We Will Walk, Christians for Trump, Conservatives for Trump, Students from Trump.
[02:10:24.817 --> 02:10:27.020]  I mean, I just can't go through it all here.
[02:10:27.020 --> 02:10:28.642]  And that's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:10:28.642 --> 02:10:29.442]  That's from Citizens.
[02:10:30.403 --> 02:10:34.024]  For Trump and America First Unity Rally coming up.
[02:10:34.024 --> 02:10:35.805]  I'm going to be there in Cleveland.
[02:10:35.805 --> 02:10:36.645]  It's going to be epic.
[02:10:36.645 --> 02:10:39.826]  We've got the big article on Infowars.com, exclusive.
[02:10:39.826 --> 02:10:41.787]  Bill Clinton and the selling of U.S.
[02:10:41.787 --> 02:10:45.368]  security, the Communist Chinese, the Russians and others.
[02:10:45.368 --> 02:10:47.168]  But are they too corrupt to fail?
[02:10:47.168 --> 02:10:48.689]  Are they too tied in?
[02:10:48.689 --> 02:10:50.049]  Too many accomplices?
[02:10:50.049 --> 02:10:53.130]  Why do the Clintons seem so invincible?
[02:10:53.130 --> 02:10:58.332]  The man who wrote the definitive book on the Clinton crime family
[02:10:59.946 --> 02:11:01.127]  And they're war on women.
[02:11:01.127 --> 02:11:04.872]  Roger Stone, former campaign head of Trump's campaign.
[02:11:04.872 --> 02:11:07.395]  His business partner is the head of the campaign.
[02:11:07.395 --> 02:11:14.724]  And of course, he's separate from the campaign, so he can operate freely, but he always gives us the key, you know, next-level info before it happens.
[02:11:14.724 --> 02:11:16.466]  So StoneZone.com.
[02:11:16.466 --> 02:11:17.888]  Roger, thank you for joining us today.
[02:11:18.695 --> 02:11:20.635]  Alex, delighted to be with you as always.
[02:11:20.635 --> 02:11:23.536]  It's an extraordinary day, I must tell you.
[02:11:23.536 --> 02:11:27.897]  Nine presidential campaigns, 40 years in American politics.
[02:11:27.897 --> 02:11:29.617]  I've never seen anything like this.
[02:11:29.617 --> 02:11:33.518]  We are obviously no longer a nation of laws.
[02:11:33.518 --> 02:11:36.019]  Now we're a nation of men.
[02:11:36.019 --> 02:11:44.500]  And although the FBI director had this great reputation as a by-the-book, law-and-order guy, obviously that is not the case.
[02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:46.821]  He said Hillary was careless.
[02:11:47.441 --> 02:11:56.483]  Judge Napolitano has made it clear in his analysis over and over again that criminal negligence here was more than sufficient for an indictment.
[02:11:56.483 --> 02:11:59.724]  Negligence, carelessness, I believe they're the same thing.
[02:11:59.724 --> 02:12:05.186]  So it boggles the mind that she's getting a pass, but I don't think she's going to get a pass from the voters.
[02:12:07.023 --> 02:12:09.526]  Why do you think Comey didn't go after her?
[02:12:09.526 --> 02:12:11.928]  I mean, she got caught lying about it.
[02:12:11.928 --> 02:12:13.650]  She got caught cutting the tops off.
[02:12:13.650 --> 02:12:15.191]  She got caught manipulating.
[02:12:15.191 --> 02:12:17.293]  Foreign governments were inside the servers.
[02:12:17.293 --> 02:12:18.775]  This is espionage.
[02:12:18.775 --> 02:12:23.139]  Clearly she was using it as a drop box to sell data and then claims she had plausible deniability.
[02:12:23.139 --> 02:12:23.799]  It's very clear.
[02:12:23.799 --> 02:12:24.841]  I've talked to a lot of experts.
[02:12:24.841 --> 02:12:25.401]  They concur.
[02:12:25.401 --> 02:12:29.205]  But why is she too big to fail with the establishment?
[02:12:29.969 --> 02:12:32.391]  I guess the global elites cover for each other.
[02:12:32.391 --> 02:12:33.932]  I think that's what's going on here.
[02:12:33.932 --> 02:12:39.016]  And unfortunately, it turns out our FBI director is one of the global elites.
[02:12:39.016 --> 02:12:42.459]  I mean, what kind of a signal does this send to everyone else who's in government?
[02:12:42.459 --> 02:12:45.921]  What kind of a signal does this send to every American citizen?
[02:12:45.921 --> 02:12:56.630]  Basically, it says violate any law you want, but if you're big enough, if you're influential enough, if you have enough money and you're well-connected in the media, the law literally does not apply for you.
[02:12:57.810 --> 02:13:01.792]  I think Donald Trump now has an opening to take the wood to Hillary.
[02:13:01.792 --> 02:13:10.316]  And I'd also say, Alex, the premium now is on selecting a running mate, a vice presidential running mate, who is an attack dog.
[02:13:10.316 --> 02:13:21.442]  Someone who can take the case right to Bill and Hillary and expose not only the ins and outs of the email scandal, but all of their scandals.
[02:13:21.442 --> 02:13:22.882]  How about you for vice president?
[02:13:22.882 --> 02:13:23.803]  You're a good attack dog.
[02:13:25.304 --> 02:13:28.185]  Nobody, I could never pass the background check.
[02:13:28.185 --> 02:13:30.246]  I have too colorful a lifestyle.
[02:13:30.246 --> 02:13:34.307]  Now we need somebody who has government experience, but someone who's a nationalist.
[02:13:34.307 --> 02:13:45.291]  Someone who believes, as Trump does, that it's time to seal our borders, that it's time to repeal these ridiculous globalist trade deals that are destroying our job climate in this country.
[02:13:45.291 --> 02:13:48.812]  Someone who will get our fiscal house in order, stop the bailouts
[02:13:49.352 --> 02:13:54.057]  For the crooks on Wall Street and generate jobs for the working people of America.
[02:13:54.057 --> 02:13:55.279]  Sure, clearly, clearly.
[02:13:55.279 --> 02:13:59.804]  Lots of excellent choices out there, and he's playing it very close to the vest.
[02:13:59.804 --> 02:14:03.067]  I don't know who he's going to pick, but I do know it will be a patriot.
[02:14:03.067 --> 02:14:04.849]  I do know it will be a nationalist.
[02:14:04.849 --> 02:14:08.854]  I know it will be somebody who adheres to the Trump agenda.
[02:14:08.854 --> 02:14:10.616]  Is Sessions still up at the top of the list?
[02:14:11.803 --> 02:14:13.804]  Well I think he is still under consideration.
[02:14:13.804 --> 02:14:19.448]  I think Jeff Sessions is a good man and I think I've said on your show that he'd be my personal choice.
[02:14:19.448 --> 02:14:23.651]  But I think the Donald is casting a very wide net.
[02:14:23.651 --> 02:14:26.673]  He wants to find the very best person.
[02:14:26.673 --> 02:14:31.996]  But now there's a premium on someone who can really take the attack to the Clintons.
[02:14:31.996 --> 02:14:34.538]  Because we know Donald Trump is not shy.
[02:14:34.538 --> 02:14:38.101]  Notice last week he said, folks the system's rigged.
[02:14:38.101 --> 02:14:39.201]  It's completely rigged.
[02:14:39.201 --> 02:14:41.443]  So he foreshadowed what was going to happen here.
[02:14:42.564 --> 02:14:45.508]  And I think that this is a blow to the Clintons.
[02:14:45.508 --> 02:14:54.501]  They may be celebrating the fact that she isn't going to go to prison, at least not for this, but this is a heavy burden to carry into a general election.
[02:14:55.745 --> 02:15:05.849]  Well, I mean, it is paradoxical that she's this evil, corrupt witch with this horrible background on record and all these crimes, and it's flagrantly obvious that she's being protected.
[02:15:05.849 --> 02:15:10.670]  It seems the mission is somehow reach out to her constituents.
[02:15:10.670 --> 02:15:19.333]  But if you watch the interviews we do in Austin or in California or other places with Democrat voters, on average, these, unfortunately, are frighteningly ignorant people.
[02:15:19.333 --> 02:15:20.874]  I mean, they don't know what the July 4th is.
[02:15:21.434 --> 02:15:23.996]  They don't even know what the three branches of government are.
[02:15:23.996 --> 02:15:31.042]  They just know, hey, there's some woman, and I feel powerful if I cast my vote for a woman in some type of groupthink.
[02:15:31.042 --> 02:15:32.944]  How do you reach people?
[02:15:34.369 --> 02:15:38.693]  That I don't think you're as informed or awake as Helen Keller when she was a child.
[02:15:38.693 --> 02:15:43.757]  You know, she had such a great human spirit, she could actually be reached out to even though she was, you know, blind and deaf.
[02:15:43.757 --> 02:15:45.839]  I mean, how do you get through to a zombie?
[02:15:45.839 --> 02:15:47.741]  I don't understand it.
[02:15:47.741 --> 02:15:50.863]  Well, the good news is I don't think Hillary's supporters are monolithic.
[02:15:51.864 --> 02:16:07.497]  I think the ripest target are a third of the Bernie Sanders supporters, who oppose these globalist trade deals, who oppose the Iraq war, who oppose the two-party duopoly that has brought this country to the brink of disaster.
[02:16:07.497 --> 02:16:10.059]  Well exactly, how could a thinking person vote for Hillary?
[02:16:11.624 --> 02:16:14.390]  Well, I don't think the people who are voting for are thinking people.
[02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:15.612]  You've made that point.
[02:16:15.612 --> 02:16:17.756]  I think they're zombies.
[02:16:17.756 --> 02:16:22.506]  But the question is, I think we have more supporters at the end of the day than they do.
[02:16:23.427 --> 02:16:26.308]  Roger, I've been asking the questions here.
[02:16:26.308 --> 02:16:30.690]  I mean, I think Donald Trump's just getting better and better, hitting her so hardcore, but what he's saying is all true.
[02:16:30.690 --> 02:16:41.615]  When you talk about taking the wood to Hillary, how does Donald, I mean, we know he's his own man, but if you're advising him, how do you take the wood to Hillary?
[02:16:41.615 --> 02:16:44.856]  How do you really take the gloves off and put brass knuckles on?
[02:16:46.084 --> 02:16:49.024]  Well, the best news, of course, is we're going to have multiple debates.
[02:16:49.024 --> 02:16:56.586]  And there is no better place for a confrontation with the Wicked Witch of the West than in those debates.
[02:16:56.586 --> 02:16:57.766]  Trump is a brawler.
[02:16:57.766 --> 02:16:59.866]  Therefore, nothing is off limits here.
[02:16:59.866 --> 02:17:16.049]  Whether it is the Clinton's epic abuse of women, because Bill is a sexual predator and Hillary has played the role of covering up his crimes by bullying and intimidating and threatening his victims, or whether it is the epic corruption of the Clinton Foundation,
[02:17:16.049 --> 02:17:17.770]  Well, this is what it's all about actually.
[02:17:17.770 --> 02:17:25.134]  Let's skip this network break and let's talk about the article that I'm going to have moved to the top of InfoWars.com and retweeted it at RealAlexJones and on Facebook.
[02:17:46.107 --> 02:18:09.732]  Everybody, just because you're patriots, libertarians, conservatives, veterans, you know about the 90s and the missile secrets, the MIRV technology, the boost systems, the targeting systems, the whole nine yards, to have RICBMs, the best in the world, given to the CHICOMs, totally insane, just to show how brazen and crazy the Clintons are, we need to get this article out because the general public doesn't remember this or doesn't know about it.
[02:18:09.732 --> 02:18:11.672]  So let's talk about the treason of the Clintons.
[02:18:11.672 --> 02:18:12.772]  Let's get into your article.
[02:18:12.772 --> 02:18:14.913]  Part one is the Russians, part two is the Chinese.
[02:18:15.984 --> 02:18:18.927]  Well, it's really extraordinary, Alex.
[02:18:18.927 --> 02:18:21.670]  I don't think this got very much coverage at the time.
[02:18:21.670 --> 02:18:30.918]  The real irony here is that rather than indicting, or I should say, rather than impeaching Bill Clinton for dallying with Monica Lewinsky in the Oval Office,
[02:18:31.499 --> 02:18:39.224]  He should have been impeached and convicted and then I think subsequently charged with treason for these two transactions.
[02:18:39.224 --> 02:18:42.206]  In essence, he ignored U.S.
[02:18:42.206 --> 02:18:57.095]  law to trade high-level technology to the Russians, but even more egregious, he essentially took $300,000 in illegal Chinese campaign contributions, passed through Johnny Chung,
[02:18:57.755 --> 02:18:58.676]  We're good to go.
[02:19:16.083 --> 02:19:18.384]  And, you know, 2,500 words.
[02:19:18.384 --> 02:19:24.007]  That's why I was happy to give it to InfoWars, because I think it needs the public exposure.
[02:19:24.007 --> 02:19:31.071]  I intend to come back and recycle this yet again, because I'm afraid we get kind of wiped out by the FBI news today.
[02:19:31.071 --> 02:19:33.052]  Sure, let me ask you this question, because it all fits together.
[02:19:33.052 --> 02:19:36.054]  It's all in the same soup.
[02:19:36.054 --> 02:19:40.276]  Why does, I know there's different power structures and things, but why do the elite allow
[02:19:41.894 --> 02:19:44.015]  The Clintons do things nobody else can do.
[02:19:44.015 --> 02:19:51.519]  I mean, the nuclear reactors to North Korea that are used to build A-bombs, when they could have given them reactors that don't do that?
[02:19:51.519 --> 02:19:56.421]  I mean, beyond the Clintons, who do you think they really represent?
[02:19:56.421 --> 02:20:02.684]  Because a lot of smart money says it's mainly the Communist Chinese, a little bit of Saudi Arabia, you know, as a second player.
[02:20:02.684 --> 02:20:03.785]  But I mean, it's just...
[02:20:04.866 --> 02:20:06.410]  Why do they work against U.S.
[02:20:06.410 --> 02:20:07.232]  interests so much?
[02:20:07.232 --> 02:20:08.555]  Why are they out to get us?
[02:20:08.555 --> 02:20:10.521]  You know, it's the Bitter Clinger comments.
[02:20:10.521 --> 02:20:11.062]  I mean, why?
[02:20:11.062 --> 02:20:12.205]  They already run the country.
[02:20:12.205 --> 02:20:13.308]  Why are they out to get us?
[02:20:14.721 --> 02:20:16.782]  I don't think they have any loyalty to anyone.
[02:20:16.782 --> 02:20:20.183]  I don't think they're loyal to the Chinese, nor are they loyal to the United States.
[02:20:20.183 --> 02:20:21.943]  They are all about the money.
[02:20:21.943 --> 02:20:26.205]  They're all about the acquisition of wealth and power.
[02:20:26.205 --> 02:20:31.086]  So, in truth, they will do anything for cash.
[02:20:31.086 --> 02:20:38.629]  That is the epic story of the Clinton Foundation, which is not a charitable organization, but a slush fund for grifters.
[02:20:38.629 --> 02:20:42.250]  So why do our elites allow them to operate like this?
[02:20:43.246 --> 02:20:49.688]  The mainstream media does not rouse the populace because the people don't know.
[02:20:49.688 --> 02:20:54.550]  Therefore, there's no pressure on our institutions to bring them to justice.
[02:20:54.550 --> 02:21:09.315]  The story of the treasonous activities in both regard to the Russians and the Chinese, and as you point out, the North Koreans, has never gotten the kind of media coverage that it would require to rouse the people.
[02:21:09.955 --> 02:21:15.977]  I firmly believe if people knew about these things, they would be angry and they would act.
[02:21:15.977 --> 02:21:29.342]  That's the strength of Infowars and Breitbart and Daily Caller and all the other important alternative media that did not exist in the 80s when the Clintons perpetrated these crimes the first time.
[02:21:29.342 --> 02:21:34.403]  So, you know, the Clintons' response to all of this is, well, that's old news.
[02:21:34.403 --> 02:21:35.003]  You know what?
[02:21:35.003 --> 02:21:36.144]  No news is old.
[02:21:36.784 --> 02:21:38.284]  If nobody heard it the first time.
[02:21:38.284 --> 02:21:40.605]  To them, it's new news.
[02:21:40.605 --> 02:21:51.007]  Let me tell you, ICBMs that can destroy our whole country and world that aren't crazy elite the Clintons gave to them, that is big news that they're going to be back in and they've helped fund ISIS, Al-Qaeda.
[02:21:51.007 --> 02:21:52.907]  These people are pure evil.
[02:21:52.907 --> 02:21:53.767]  What is on your radar?
[02:21:53.767 --> 02:21:55.428]  Because I've got a bunch of questions.
[02:21:55.428 --> 02:22:00.869]  I want to talk about how Trump's doing, where this is going, what other attacks you expect, the polling numbers.
[02:22:00.869 --> 02:22:02.989]  There's a lot to cover one at a time here.
[02:22:02.989 --> 02:22:06.210]  But what else do you want to get out there to the audience, Roger?
[02:22:07.093 --> 02:22:10.854]  Well, we have a big victory today, as you announced at the beginning.
[02:22:10.854 --> 02:22:14.836]  We have finally prevailed over the city of Cleveland.
[02:22:14.836 --> 02:22:21.418]  We have our permits after going to court and being represented by the liberal ACLU to do so.
[02:22:21.418 --> 02:22:25.480]  We have knocked down their restrictions on free speech.
[02:22:25.480 --> 02:22:34.043]  We don't need to bring the duct tape to Cleveland and put it over our mouths to demonstrate the outrageousness of their anti-free speech position.
[02:22:35.023 --> 02:22:47.145]  The rally at which you are speaking, I am speaking, many other patriots are speaking, is July 18th at 11 o'clock in the morning at the Settlers Landing Park.
[02:22:47.145 --> 02:22:51.266]  We now have a permit from the city of Cleveland.
[02:22:51.266 --> 02:23:01.448]  We are scrambling to raise the money to pay for the staging that is required by the city, the public address system we will need, the marshals, and all of the others.
[02:23:01.448 --> 02:23:02.248]  Sir, how much money do you need?
[02:23:03.422 --> 02:23:07.988]  We're going to have to raise at least $30,000 to pay for everything from soup to nuts.
[02:23:07.988 --> 02:23:13.315]  As you know, we stopped our fundraising when the city stopped negotiating with us.
[02:23:13.315 --> 02:23:14.837]  Now we have to gin it back up.
[02:23:14.837 --> 02:23:16.159]  Let me just say this.
[02:23:16.159 --> 02:23:18.602]  I've already signed a contract and I went ahead and doubled down.
[02:23:19.443 --> 02:23:21.225]  Two contracts.
[02:23:21.225 --> 02:23:24.649]  $30,000 plus $5,000 for the banner in Cleveland.
[02:23:24.649 --> 02:23:26.831]  And then $30,000 plus $5,000 for the banner.
[02:23:26.831 --> 02:23:27.712]  I guess we're doing two banners.
[02:23:27.712 --> 02:23:28.713]  One's InfoWars.
[02:23:28.713 --> 02:23:30.735]  One is Hillary for Prison.
[02:23:30.735 --> 02:23:33.358]  We're going to mainly file the Hillary for Prison one, but the InfoWars is the backup one.
[02:23:33.358 --> 02:23:34.519]  Sometimes the banners tear.
[02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:36.801]  After a few flights.
[02:23:36.801 --> 02:23:38.883]  But we're going to have planes for four days in the year.
[02:23:38.883 --> 02:23:40.004]  Two days at each event.
[02:23:40.004 --> 02:23:40.925]  Hillary for prison.
[02:23:40.925 --> 02:23:42.286]  Big giant banners.
[02:23:42.286 --> 02:23:44.608]  That's a $70,000 investment.
[02:23:44.608 --> 02:23:49.252]  I'm taking all the profits from the Hillary for prison shirts and putting it into that.
[02:23:49.252 --> 02:23:50.633]  But we need to sell the shirts.
[02:23:50.633 --> 02:23:51.133]  They're $19.95.
[02:23:51.133 --> 02:23:53.035]  We're selling them at full price.
[02:23:53.035 --> 02:23:55.277]  Not $5.95 like we were before.
[02:23:55.277 --> 02:23:55.757]  $5.
[02:23:55.757 --> 02:23:56.538]  That's at cost.
[02:23:56.538 --> 02:23:58.639]  I cannot do this folks without your support.
[02:23:59.528 --> 02:24:06.275]  I've already signed the contracts, so either the money comes in or somebody gets laid off, but that's not going to happen.
[02:24:06.275 --> 02:24:07.516]  I know the Patriots are going to come through.
[02:24:07.516 --> 02:24:13.462]  Buy your Hillary for Prison shirts at InfowarsStore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:24:13.462 --> 02:24:17.786]  But I'm doubling down for my country, my kids, everything, Roger.
[02:24:17.786 --> 02:24:22.090]  I'm putting a $10,000 down right now because this isn't like a political deal where it's limited, right?
[02:24:22.090 --> 02:24:23.211]  This is a free speech event.
[02:24:23.211 --> 02:24:23.531]  Can I give $10,000?
[02:24:25.011 --> 02:24:25.552]  That is correct.
[02:24:25.552 --> 02:24:30.099]  There are no limitations whatsoever on what an individual can give.
[02:24:30.099 --> 02:24:33.484]  I've got to start hitting the phones very hard to help raise the money.
[02:24:34.517 --> 02:24:40.500]  Today, he won a wire, whatever, $10,000 from Infowars towards this event.
[02:24:40.500 --> 02:24:43.121]  And again, this gets back to Trump.
[02:24:43.121 --> 02:24:44.521]  Obviously, the big money's not going to come to him.
[02:24:44.521 --> 02:24:45.842]  He hasn't even asked for it.
[02:24:45.842 --> 02:24:49.143]  He's turned it down, the Adelson money, to put Gingrich on the ticket.
[02:24:49.143 --> 02:24:50.964]  He's a hero for that alone.
[02:24:50.964 --> 02:24:52.305]  Hopefully, that holds.
[02:24:52.305 --> 02:24:56.006]  But doesn't Trump need to go ahead and put some of the big money down first?
[02:24:56.006 --> 02:24:57.867]  He's already put down $50-something million of his own.
[02:24:57.867 --> 02:25:02.029]  But shouldn't he just all in, like $100 million, to cause a domino effect, break the ice?
[02:25:03.531 --> 02:25:08.696]  Look, he put $40 million into his race for the nomination.
[02:25:08.696 --> 02:25:10.678]  And that ain't chopped liver.
[02:25:10.678 --> 02:25:15.902]  And he certainly has the wherewithal to do what is necessary, which is why I'm not nervous.
[02:25:15.902 --> 02:25:22.428]  In fact, like you, I kind of like that he hasn't taken the elite money with the strings on it.
[02:25:22.428 --> 02:25:26.832]  The greatest single attribute that he has going into this election is his independence.
[02:25:26.832 --> 02:25:28.634]  The fact that he can't be bought.
[02:25:29.074 --> 02:25:30.175]  He can't be bullied.
[02:25:30.175 --> 02:25:31.737]  He can't be bossed.
[02:25:31.737 --> 02:25:34.699]  He answers only to the American people.
[02:25:34.699 --> 02:25:37.762]  And he just will never adopt the globalist agenda.
[02:25:37.762 --> 02:25:40.204]  So, Alex, I thank you for your generosity.
[02:25:40.204 --> 02:25:42.866]  I think this is going to be a great rally.
[02:25:42.866 --> 02:25:47.510]  But the real message for all the Trump supporters out there is show of strength.
[02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:49.472]  We need a show of strength.
[02:25:49.472 --> 02:25:52.374]  Our rally is a peaceful demonstration.
[02:25:52.374 --> 02:25:52.875]  Let me be clear.
[02:25:52.875 --> 02:25:55.197]  Let me interrupt you, Roger, because this is so important.
[02:25:56.878 --> 02:25:57.378]  Okay.
[02:25:57.378 --> 02:25:59.039]  Roger Stone works 18 hours a day.
[02:25:59.039 --> 02:26:00.279]  He's got a really bad cold today.
[02:26:00.279 --> 02:26:03.140]  He's still on air with us because he knows this is history happening.
[02:26:03.140 --> 02:26:04.080]  He says he's never been involved.
[02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:06.261]  He's been involved in like eight, you know, eight different elections.
[02:26:06.261 --> 02:26:07.582]  He's seen nothing like this.
[02:26:07.582 --> 02:26:08.742]  Okay.
[02:26:08.742 --> 02:26:09.742]  And this is history.
[02:26:09.742 --> 02:26:11.363]  That's why I'm all in.
[02:26:11.363 --> 02:26:15.224]  It's why I'm spending every amount of money comes in this year on reporters and crew.
[02:26:15.224 --> 02:26:17.405]  Usually I take some profit and try to put some money back.
[02:26:17.705 --> 02:26:21.787]  I'm everything in this year because it's my kids, it's my country, it's my future.
[02:26:21.787 --> 02:26:23.168]  And I know you know that.
[02:26:23.168 --> 02:26:31.372]  But I'm telling you, beyond sending money to help pay for this event they tried to ban three times and there's been lawsuits and we've battled them and all the rest of it.
[02:26:31.372 --> 02:26:32.973]  Everywhere you've got to get in the streets.
[02:26:32.973 --> 02:26:34.414]  Everywhere you've got to run for office.
[02:26:34.414 --> 02:26:36.995]  Everywhere you've got to call in to talk radio and put up YouTubes.
[02:26:36.995 --> 02:26:42.538]  Because we've got to get outside the liberty box and educate all these other folks very aggressively.
[02:26:42.538 --> 02:26:43.179]  But please!
[02:26:43.979 --> 02:26:45.340]  Don't thank me when you call up.
[02:26:45.340 --> 02:26:47.261]  I want to thank you for your support, listeners.
[02:26:47.261 --> 02:26:50.023]  And I want to say, get your butts to Cleveland.
[02:26:50.023 --> 02:26:53.545]  I don't care if it's this one rally, on this morning, or whatever it is.
[02:26:53.545 --> 02:26:55.866]  They're trying to shut our free speech down everywhere.
[02:26:55.866 --> 02:26:57.507]  We've got to use it or lose it.
[02:26:57.507 --> 02:26:59.348]  This is a war.
[02:26:59.348 --> 02:27:01.049]  And this is a fight.
[02:27:01.049 --> 02:27:01.629]  Okay?
[02:27:01.629 --> 02:27:06.412]  And so thank you for buying our products, because listen, you're only going to see bigger results out of it.
[02:27:06.412 --> 02:27:09.934]  What you put in, you're going to get back very aggressively deployed.
[02:27:09.934 --> 02:27:13.196]  But Roger, how do folks go and give donations right now to help pay for this rally?
[02:27:14.304 --> 02:27:14.684]  I don't know.
[02:27:33.436 --> 02:27:34.917]  To pay for this rally.
[02:27:34.917 --> 02:27:36.639]  That is our immediate goal.
[02:27:36.639 --> 02:27:38.200]  But look, I'm very excited about it.
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:40.162]  We've got an all-star lineup.
[02:27:40.162 --> 02:27:42.303]  I'm trying to get Ian Coulter to speak.
[02:27:42.303 --> 02:27:44.385]  Diamond and Silk will be there.
[02:27:44.385 --> 02:27:47.127]  This is going to be a great patriotic rally.
[02:27:47.127 --> 02:27:48.688]  And again, I stress...
[02:27:49.389 --> 02:27:52.490]  This is a peaceful demonstration.
[02:27:52.490 --> 02:28:09.254]  We know the Black Lives Matter and the move on thugs paid for by George Soros will be there and will attempt in every possible way to incite violence so that the mainstream media can then blame that violence on Donald Trump's and his supporters.
[02:28:09.254 --> 02:28:16.916]  So come to Cleveland, but be prepared to turn the other cheek and show through numbers the support for Donald Trump.
[02:28:17.136 --> 02:28:18.076]  And I'm going to be there, folks.
[02:28:18.076 --> 02:28:18.597]  Stand with us.
[02:28:18.597 --> 02:28:20.797]  Now, in closing, Hillary's a monster.
[02:28:20.797 --> 02:28:22.158]  She's a gangster.
[02:28:22.158 --> 02:28:25.379]  We can't, nobody can complain to Trump for what he's done, money-wise.
[02:28:25.379 --> 02:28:26.839]  He's already put in 40-something million.
[02:28:26.839 --> 02:28:28.520]  He's putting his life on the line.
[02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:31.601]  I really think this witch can't handle going up against him in debates.
[02:28:31.601 --> 02:28:32.962]  I think she's going to try to kill him.
[02:28:32.962 --> 02:28:35.362]  I mean, I look at photos of her and the way she's acting lately.
[02:28:35.362 --> 02:28:36.663]  She looks like a psychotic monster.
[02:28:37.830 --> 02:28:40.173]  Yeah, I think she has a dual personality.
[02:28:40.173 --> 02:28:47.161]  I think the book by Gary Byrne, the Secret Service agent, which the Clintons are working overtime to suppress.
[02:28:47.161 --> 02:28:54.791]  They've been leaning on the networks, they've been leaning on the cable networks not to interview him, not to publicize him.
[02:28:54.791 --> 02:28:56.253]  They banned you on three cable networks?
[02:28:57.008 --> 02:29:00.990]  Yeah, it's, you know, what can I say?
[02:29:00.990 --> 02:29:14.257]  It is outrageous that we would somehow think that what this agent who served this country has to say is somehow less important or less credible than two of the biggest liars in American history, Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[02:29:14.257 --> 02:29:19.300]  But if you listen to what Agent Byrne says, this woman is bipolar.
[02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:20.821]  She has two personalities.
[02:29:22.651 --> 02:29:27.095]  Stonezone.com, Roger Stone, thank you for coming on, even though you're under the weather, my friend.
[02:29:27.095 --> 02:29:30.477]  You're a tough guy, and we really appreciate you.
[02:29:30.477 --> 02:29:32.799]  We look forward to speaking to you again soon.
[02:29:32.799 --> 02:29:34.741]  In 10 seconds, how's Trump's spirits?
[02:29:34.741 --> 02:29:36.542]  They look pretty strong.
[02:29:36.542 --> 02:29:37.683]  He's in great mood.
[02:29:37.683 --> 02:29:40.565]  I talked to him yesterday, and he's feeling good.
[02:29:40.565 --> 02:29:42.246]  Like all Americans, he's outraged.
[02:29:43.127 --> 02:29:46.669]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:46.669 --> 02:29:48.390]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.686 --> 02:30:05.750]  The demand for pain-ray weapons grows over fears of civil unrest.
[02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:17.600]  According to a new research study, the market for directed-energy weapons is expected to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period thanks for their use in controlling riots and cross-border trespassing.
[02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:22.204]  The global riot control system market is estimated to grow from $9 billion in 2016 to $11.78 billion by 2021.
[02:30:27.008 --> 02:30:40.975]  As a result of increasing political disputes and civil unrest, militarization of law enforcement agencies, stringent environmental and governmental regulations, and declining defense budgets of developed economies, states the report.
[02:30:40.975 --> 02:30:52.081]  So-called pain rays or active denial systems work by blasting controlled microwaves into a crowd of people, creating an unbearably hot sensation that forces them to flee the scene.
[02:30:52.081 --> 02:30:55.803]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[02:31:00.043 --> 02:31:08.205]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[02:31:08.205 --> 02:31:09.025]  Here's why.
[02:31:09.025 --> 02:31:13.166]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[02:31:13.166 --> 02:31:14.087]  So please listen.
[02:31:14.087 --> 02:31:17.788]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:31:17.788 --> 02:31:24.169]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:31:24.169 --> 02:31:26.490]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts,
[02:31:26.750 --> 02:31:28.531]  Intensifying civil unrest.
[02:31:28.531 --> 02:31:31.472]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[02:31:31.472 --> 02:31:33.813]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[02:31:33.813 --> 02:31:38.656]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[02:31:38.656 --> 02:31:45.399]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[02:31:45.399 --> 02:31:47.140]  So it's a good time to check it out.

[02:33:02.575 --> 02:33:08.499]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:08.499 --> 02:33:19.565]  Alright, I appreciate Denise holding.
[02:33:19.565 --> 02:33:21.226]  I appreciate Sergeant B holding.
[02:33:21.226 --> 02:33:24.868]  I appreciate Shane and Lonnie and Justin.
[02:33:24.868 --> 02:33:27.790]  Everybody, I'm gonna get to all of you right now.
[02:33:27.790 --> 02:33:31.412]  Just briefly, I was talking to Roger Stone during the break.
[02:33:32.862 --> 02:33:41.187]  About the fact that we have to raise like $32,000 just to have like a four or five hour rally down there Look, there's gonna be massive media coverage of this.
[02:33:41.187 --> 02:33:45.749]  It's right across from the RNC's meeting The George Soros people aren't gonna get permits.
[02:33:45.749 --> 02:33:55.514]  They're gonna do whatever they want and run around and you know attack and spit on things and just do what they generally do Because they serve the foreign multinational globalists.
[02:33:55.514 --> 02:33:56.955]  That's why they claim they're anti-establishment.
[02:33:56.955 --> 02:33:58.156]  They are the filth of the earth
[02:34:00.333 --> 02:34:04.136]  But they make them get PA systems, porta-potties, and pay for the police.
[02:34:04.136 --> 02:34:05.478]  That is wrong.
[02:34:05.478 --> 02:34:12.004]  It should be in the police budget to take care of big rallies and big demonstrations around key times like this.
[02:34:12.004 --> 02:34:19.931]  But it's libertarians, and it's patriots, and it's conservatives that try to not cause a disturbance.
[02:34:19.931 --> 02:34:21.092]  But I'll tell you something.
[02:34:21.732 --> 02:34:26.613]  When I get told I can't have a demonstration, but other people can, I'm going to have it regardless.
[02:34:26.613 --> 02:34:31.014]  Well, the good news is they backed off because of two different lawsuits and they claim this is it.
[02:34:31.014 --> 02:34:33.334]  So that's why I'm going to this.
[02:34:33.334 --> 02:34:40.355]  I'm going to be part of this because it's a symbol of free speech and the globalists are coming after free speech.
[02:34:40.355 --> 02:34:48.497]  But beyond that, I've got all sorts of tricks up my sleeve that are legal and lawful for Cleveland, but we're going to put out
[02:34:50.393 --> 02:34:52.755]  Hundreds of thousands of leaflets.
[02:34:52.755 --> 02:34:54.697]  We're going to do other things.
[02:34:54.697 --> 02:34:56.978]  We're going to have aircraft in the sky.
[02:34:56.978 --> 02:35:07.007]  And believe me, Hillary will go to the level, we've had this before with the Democrats especially, trying to block us doing things like putting aircraft in the sky.
[02:35:07.007 --> 02:35:09.088]  That just becomes a bigger issue.
[02:35:09.088 --> 02:35:13.552]  See, people think you fight tyranny and then you get defeated at one level in one battle, you've lost.
[02:35:13.552 --> 02:35:18.536]  No, you learn about the enemy, you expose what they're doing, you show people they're tyrants.
[02:35:18.536 --> 02:35:19.697]  That's the beginning of the end.
[02:35:20.748 --> 02:35:25.671]  Like the corrupt EU saying, we're not going to allow a vote, we're just taking you over.
[02:35:25.671 --> 02:35:29.253]  Well, in the end, people started backlashing against that.
[02:35:29.253 --> 02:35:33.235]  Only submitting to tyranny is how you lose.
[02:35:33.235 --> 02:35:35.856]  Resisting it, you always end up winning.
[02:35:35.856 --> 02:35:38.178]  It may take five years, it may take ten years.
[02:35:38.178 --> 02:35:39.658]  It may take six months.
[02:35:39.658 --> 02:35:42.100]  But the worm is turning.
[02:35:42.100 --> 02:35:49.544]  Just to give people the good news, InfoWars is one of the main focal points, not just here in the US, but all over the world, of resistance to globalism.
[02:35:51.181 --> 02:36:10.181]  And we've gone from being ridiculed, demonized, attacked, just totally lied about, to more and more, especially in other nations, it's not just populist or right-wingers that like us, it's true liberals and it's nationalists that are just common sense all over the world, from Brazil to South Africa, from Nigeria to Japan.
[02:36:10.962 --> 02:36:26.410]  From Russia to Germany, from the UK to Canada, from Mexico to Chile to Australia, InfoWars, in many cases, is more popular per capita in foreign nations.
[02:36:26.410 --> 02:36:29.172]  A couple African nations were like in the top 20 and stuff.
[02:36:29.172 --> 02:36:31.333]  It's crazy.
[02:36:31.333 --> 02:36:32.794]  So, let me tell you something.
[02:36:32.794 --> 02:36:37.677]  People are listening worldwide.
[02:36:37.677 --> 02:36:40.138]  And Americans, to a certain extent, are in this bubble.
[02:36:41.829 --> 02:36:45.412]  Americans have the lowest level of passports, except for North Korea.
[02:36:45.412 --> 02:36:49.474]  Americans, on average, do have the fattest... Come on a second, folks, they're overweight.
[02:36:49.474 --> 02:36:50.775]  I've been overweight before, too.
[02:36:50.775 --> 02:36:54.538]  But I'm just saying, on average, the fattest, dumbest, most lethargic people.
[02:36:54.538 --> 02:37:02.884]  Doesn't mean we're all bad, but statistically, we are at the bottom of the barrel.
[02:37:02.884 --> 02:37:06.987]  But that's starting to change, because once you hit bottom, there's nowhere else to go but up, right?
[02:37:08.206 --> 02:37:09.467]  Historically.
[02:37:09.467 --> 02:37:11.668]  So I want to commend all of you for your support.
[02:37:11.668 --> 02:37:13.449]  I want to commend you all for your prayers.
[02:37:13.449 --> 02:37:15.731]  That's what I really need.
[02:37:15.731 --> 02:37:18.072]  Because I'm in such a fight with the globalists.
[02:37:18.072 --> 02:37:18.813]  I know the stakes.
[02:37:18.813 --> 02:37:19.653]  I know how real it is.
[02:37:19.653 --> 02:37:21.334]  And I just get sick at my stomach.
[02:37:21.334 --> 02:37:22.635]  Like I'm not working hard enough.
[02:37:22.635 --> 02:37:23.736]  Like I'm not doing enough.
[02:37:25.219 --> 02:37:33.580]  Like I'm not, sometimes at like five or six I gotta do more work and I want to, my spirit wants to but my flesh is weak and I'm just like dizzy.
[02:37:33.580 --> 02:37:44.482]  I'm so exhausted and I just got more to do and I know I can fight the enemy and I can put out a viral video and I can really expose this and I'm gonna learn to just go, I give it to God, this is all I can do, just turn loose.
[02:37:44.482 --> 02:37:48.963]  Or I'm gonna have a heart attack by the time I'm 55 and I don't want that.
[02:37:48.963 --> 02:37:53.664]  So my kids deserve me to be healthy but all I'm saying is don't call up telling me how great I am because
[02:37:55.010 --> 02:37:56.731]  It's the opposite of that.
[02:37:56.731 --> 02:37:59.032]  My guts and everything are like, fight harder.
[02:37:59.032 --> 02:38:02.014]  And I'm very angry at myself, okay?
[02:38:02.014 --> 02:38:04.635]  And that's not a listening going, oh Alex, you're doing good, don't worry about it.
[02:38:04.635 --> 02:38:06.396]  I'm really telling you how I feel.
[02:38:06.396 --> 02:38:08.377]  Because I know how bad these people are.
[02:38:08.377 --> 02:38:09.418]  I know how evil they are.
[02:38:09.418 --> 02:38:13.881]  It really freaks me out.
[02:38:13.881 --> 02:38:16.762]  I mean, look at that photo that's up on Real Alex Jones on Twitter again.
[02:38:16.762 --> 02:38:20.544]  This is, I'm convinced, the most evil photo of Hillary I've ever seen.
[02:38:20.544 --> 02:38:21.345]  And you really look at her,
[02:38:22.580 --> 02:38:31.727]  I look at this photo of her and, man, I... I actually... my heart flutters.
[02:38:31.727 --> 02:38:32.587]  Oh, God.
[02:38:32.587 --> 02:38:33.368]  Oh, God.
[02:38:33.368 --> 02:38:33.928]  Oh, God.
[02:38:33.928 --> 02:38:37.271]  Those eyes tell you everything you need to know.
[02:38:37.271 --> 02:38:39.833]  Man, she enjoys power.
[02:38:39.833 --> 02:38:41.394]  She enjoys lies.
[02:38:41.394 --> 02:38:43.475]  She enjoys suppression.
[02:38:43.475 --> 02:38:44.636]  She treats everybody like crap.
[02:38:44.636 --> 02:38:45.977]  She doesn't give tips.
[02:38:45.977 --> 02:38:47.698]  She doesn't let you look her in the eye.
[02:38:47.698 --> 02:38:49.800]  She is an arrogant monster pig.
[02:38:53.925 --> 02:38:55.886]  She hates us so much, folks.
[02:38:55.886 --> 02:38:58.788]  Oh my God.
[02:38:58.788 --> 02:39:01.030]  I think she might cause a nuclear war or something.
[02:39:01.030 --> 02:39:02.271]  I just, there's something about her.
[02:39:02.271 --> 02:39:07.314]  I think, I look at Kim Jong-un and I also have the same feeling, but not as bad.
[02:39:07.314 --> 02:39:16.441]  It's just, oh, it's so, because they're so soft and weak, but because they're in a bully position, they can get away with anything.
[02:39:16.441 --> 02:39:17.822]  Like a vampire.
[02:39:17.822 --> 02:39:18.162]  Briefly,
[02:39:21.653 --> 02:39:27.641]  I'm already putting planes in the sky for four days over the RNC and DNC.
[02:39:27.641 --> 02:39:28.502]  I looked at blimps.
[02:39:28.502 --> 02:39:29.744]  Those are just way too much.
[02:39:29.744 --> 02:39:34.811]  We're talking half a million dollar commitment for a big blimp.
[02:39:34.811 --> 02:39:36.834]  And then, of course, that's like a multi-month contract.
[02:39:36.834 --> 02:39:37.675]  They go to all these different cities.
[02:39:37.675 --> 02:39:39.117]  They just don't do it where you go to one city.
[02:39:40.370 --> 02:39:41.752]  Do you imagine a blimp going around St.
[02:39:41.752 --> 02:39:42.493]  Hillary for President?
[02:39:42.493 --> 02:39:44.755]  Oh, that'd be the biggest thing ever.
[02:39:44.755 --> 02:39:46.297]  Tuck Scarface, the world is yours.
[02:39:46.297 --> 02:39:48.239]  Instead, you're going to prison, Hillary.
[02:39:48.239 --> 02:39:49.381]  A Goodyear blimp?
[02:39:49.381 --> 02:39:51.323]  I know they'd get involved and block that.
[02:39:51.323 --> 02:39:59.132]  We've already got a couple backup Air Forces ready with the more primitive banners that if they try to block us with this group or something, you know, we'll just shift to another backup plan.
[02:40:00.469 --> 02:40:04.171]  The point is, we need to sell a lot of the Hillary for Prison t-shirts to pay for that, but regardless, I'm all in.
[02:40:04.171 --> 02:40:05.952]  InfoWareStore.com.
[02:40:05.952 --> 02:40:09.314]  Our 4th of July mega special is going to be extended throughout the week.
[02:40:09.314 --> 02:40:19.179]  I'm only able to do this a couple times a year, but they've allowed us because of all the globalist talk of food shortages and food price increases, which I hope aren't the case, but we're preparing for the worst, hoping for the best here.
[02:40:19.179 --> 02:40:23.261]  We got 20 to 40% off all the great storable food there at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:40:24.662 --> 02:40:29.767]  We also have 20% off Survival Shield Nation Ida and the good X2 that blocks the bad halogens has changed my life.
[02:40:29.767 --> 02:40:31.269]  Alexa Pure Water filters are 20% off.
[02:40:31.269 --> 02:40:32.690]  Alexa Pure Air filters are 20% off.
[02:40:32.690 --> 02:40:34.272]  A lot of other specials as well.
[02:40:34.272 --> 02:40:37.335]  Check them all out at InfoWarsStore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:40:37.335 --> 02:40:37.375]  888-253-3139.
[02:40:45.268 --> 02:40:47.831]  And it is your purchase of these products that funds the operation.
[02:40:47.831 --> 02:40:51.415]  Plus, these are things everybody needs going into these very uncertain times.
[02:40:51.415 --> 02:40:53.677]  Patriots need to be self-sufficient.
[02:40:53.677 --> 02:40:58.443]  The enemy bets their whole game plan on us being dependent on them.
[02:40:59.949 --> 02:41:02.030]  And prepping now is absolutely essential.
[02:41:02.030 --> 02:41:05.772]  It's gone from a possibility of collapse to a probability to a certainty.
[02:41:05.772 --> 02:41:07.433]  It just depends on how bad it'll be.
[02:41:07.433 --> 02:41:08.793]  But worldwide, it's already in full swing.
[02:41:08.793 --> 02:41:10.594]  We're already in a depression in most areas.
[02:41:10.594 --> 02:41:11.715]  It's just not equally distributed.
[02:41:11.715 --> 02:41:15.236]  You can call toll-free to ask any questions about specials or to order via the phone as well.
[02:41:15.236 --> 02:41:15.456]  888-253-3139.
[02:41:15.456 --> 02:41:15.516]  888-253-3139.
[02:41:15.516 --> 02:41:15.636]  Okay.
[02:41:15.636 --> 02:41:17.357]  I appreciate Denise and Sergeant B.
[02:41:25.925 --> 02:41:28.046]  And Shane, everybody else holding, I'm going to go to you right now.
[02:41:28.046 --> 02:41:28.886]  Thank you for holding.
[02:41:28.886 --> 02:41:37.248]  Denise from Illinois, what do you think of the FBI director admitting she did all these horrible things but says they can't indict her?
[02:41:37.248 --> 02:41:45.150]  I'm calling just to point out the flags in the Comey speech, on both sides of them.
[02:41:45.150 --> 02:41:48.090]  The blue flag, that's the federal department.
[02:41:48.090 --> 02:41:51.111]  The word federal is upside down and backwards.
[02:41:52.092 --> 02:41:57.117]  So between their false flags and their theatrics, they're getting pretty sloppy.
[02:41:57.117 --> 02:41:59.400]  They don't have the flags right.
[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:01.562]  You don't really have a press conference.
[02:42:01.562 --> 02:42:03.644]  There's no, you know, media there.
[02:42:03.644 --> 02:42:06.086]  No flash bulbs going off.
[02:42:06.086 --> 02:42:14.555]  And if Hillary becomes president and 150 million lose their jobs, I think we're going to have nothing better to do than walk the streets of Washington.
[02:42:15.905 --> 02:42:21.048]  That's a good point that I didn't hear any press in there, but they called it a statement in the press conference.
[02:42:21.048 --> 02:42:23.109]  More and more they tell the press what to do.
[02:42:23.109 --> 02:42:24.870]  They get their questions beforehand.
[02:42:24.870 --> 02:42:28.572]  More and more we act like a Soviet nation.
[02:42:28.572 --> 02:42:33.776]  And if you look at those flags, who bought these flags?
[02:42:33.776 --> 02:42:35.997]  But talk a little prophecy now.
[02:42:35.997 --> 02:42:38.979]  As far as Hillary, she's president.
[02:42:38.979 --> 02:42:41.200]  I, you know, I can't put out there the fact that
[02:42:41.850 --> 02:42:43.571]  Antichrist couldn't be a woman.
[02:42:43.571 --> 02:42:44.711]  That's all I gotta say.
[02:42:44.711 --> 02:42:45.691]  I appreciate your call.
[02:42:45.691 --> 02:42:50.972]  You know, everybody always says that every new evil leader is the Antichrist and Obama's the Antichrist and the rest of this.
[02:42:50.972 --> 02:42:53.393]  The Bible says there are many Antichrists.
[02:42:53.393 --> 02:42:56.114]  The Antichrist's spirit.
[02:42:56.114 --> 02:42:59.815]  Then there is the Antichrist.
[02:42:59.815 --> 02:43:07.937]  But I think when you're selling baby parts and putting baby flavoring and soft drinks and selling us out to the communist Chinese and trying to break up families, I mean, these are evil people.
[02:43:09.946 --> 02:43:11.307]  These are evil, evil, evil people.
[02:43:11.307 --> 02:43:12.808]  I don't think there's any doubting that.
[02:43:12.808 --> 02:43:16.850]  And there are more and more signs in government that the wheel's coming off.
[02:43:16.850 --> 02:43:19.371]  And look, the globalists want a civil war.
[02:43:19.371 --> 02:43:24.975]  And as I've gotten a little more sophisticated in the last few years, last decade or so, really, I realize we've got big problems with government.
[02:43:25.745 --> 02:43:31.690]  But it's big mega-corporations that have taken control of our government that want totalitarianism, that have set it up.
[02:43:31.690 --> 02:43:46.261]  So instead of just blaming the TSA, when most of them are just workers that want a paycheck and buy into this false narrative, some of them are bad, it's come out, we should blame Congress that leaves our borders open, flies in all these foreigners, doesn't check them but then checks us.
[02:43:46.261 --> 02:43:47.101]  This is slave training.
[02:43:47.101 --> 02:43:50.084]  So let's blame Congress instead of just blaming the TSA.
[02:43:50.084 --> 02:43:51.485]  And I say blame them too.
[02:43:52.571 --> 02:44:00.597]  And when it gets down to the police, yeah, we can all see footage of 330 million Americans, bad cops and corruption and problems, and go after it.
[02:44:00.597 --> 02:44:10.564]  But just making it the issue and making, you know, shooting a cop while they pump gas or change a tire, that's how you fix things.
[02:44:10.564 --> 02:44:11.224]  That'll show them.
[02:44:12.645 --> 02:44:23.788]  That's all globalist garbage to absolutely bring this country into a civil war and brand the civil war as citizens running around burning things and overturning police cars.
[02:44:23.788 --> 02:44:34.431]  If there's a civil war in this country that the globalists start, we need to think about the big brokers, the globalists, the technicians, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie Endowment.
[02:44:35.575 --> 02:44:36.816]  You know, they want a war.
[02:44:36.816 --> 02:44:38.057]  I'm not calling for anything violent.
[02:44:38.057 --> 02:44:46.102]  I'm just waiting to identify the collaborators, the globalists, the people that have come in and taken control.
[02:44:46.102 --> 02:44:50.245]  The George Soros's of the world.
[02:44:50.245 --> 02:44:57.531]  Who are trying to start a civil war in this country and who've successfully started them all over the world.
[02:44:57.531 --> 02:44:59.772]  Let's go ahead and go to Sergeant B from Texas.
[02:44:59.772 --> 02:45:00.333]  You're on the air.
[02:45:00.333 --> 02:45:00.613]  Welcome.
[02:45:04.343 --> 02:45:07.386]  I wanted to put a call out to everyone listening.
[02:45:07.386 --> 02:45:15.131]  We need everyone out there who has any skills in multimedia, audio, video, PowerPoint, slideshows, you name it.
[02:45:15.131 --> 02:45:32.124]  Need a campaign and start putting out a list of everyone who's been prosecuted for the same crimes Hillary committed with the quote by Director Comey saying no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case because it's obviously bull.
[02:45:33.234 --> 02:45:34.195]  Right in U.S.
[02:45:34.195 --> 02:45:54.248]  Code 793, it is stated in multiple paragraphs, very wordy, I'm not going to read the whole thing, but it does state very clearly what he said in that press conference today, that she did commit these crimes, and it does state, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years or both.
[02:45:54.248 --> 02:45:56.069]  That's right.
[02:45:56.069 --> 02:45:57.750]  This needs to be viral.
[02:45:58.439 --> 02:46:03.721]  It needs to be put out in every single media, and it needs to be done now.
[02:46:03.721 --> 02:46:19.085]  By the way, Joe Biggs, who's going to the border today, just ran in here earlier when Leigh-Anne was in the studio and said, look, we should start a meme basically showing all the people that have been charged for the exact same thing that Hillary did.
[02:46:20.148 --> 02:46:24.330]  That's exactly it, and it's not just enough for us to talk to each other who are already knowledgeable about this.
[02:46:24.330 --> 02:46:26.391]  We need to reach out to these liberal idiots.
[02:46:42.972 --> 02:46:51.218]  Who don't have any concept of the rule of the law, and we need to reach out to them and bang them over the head with this knowledge and get them to understand why it's wrong.
[02:46:51.218 --> 02:46:53.459]  She didn't break rules, she broke the federal law.
[02:46:53.459 --> 02:46:59.543]  Well look, I know all these idiot so-called leftists are really a bunch of moron fascists, but I want to say something to them.
[02:46:59.543 --> 02:47:02.185]  Communist China has killed over 100 million of its people.
[02:47:02.185 --> 02:47:04.867]  Mao killed 80-something million.
[02:47:04.867 --> 02:47:06.588]  Women and men are slaves.
[02:47:07.830 --> 02:47:10.056]  They have absolutely no rights unless they're in the party.
[02:47:10.056 --> 02:47:11.499]  It's total evil.
[02:47:11.499 --> 02:47:12.983]  No environmental standards, no nothing.
[02:47:12.983 --> 02:47:14.707]  But you're too busy hating America.
[02:47:16.118 --> 02:47:19.679]  Never realized how hellish Venezuela or China are.
[02:47:19.679 --> 02:47:26.421]  And so they don't care if Hillary sold out to the Imams and sold out to these Gulf states that murder women and murder homosexuals.
[02:47:26.421 --> 02:47:27.282]  They just don't care.
[02:47:27.282 --> 02:47:28.722]  I don't think they care.
[02:47:28.722 --> 02:47:34.304]  They like the fact that they think they're on a winning team, even though they're schmucks being destroyed by Hillary.
[02:47:34.304 --> 02:47:35.904]  So I don't know how we reach out to them.
[02:47:35.904 --> 02:47:38.065]  I don't know how we get them to turn around.
[02:47:38.065 --> 02:47:40.226]  They are just, they are just horrible people.
[02:47:42.406 --> 02:47:45.988]  We need to fight with the Infowar, exactly like your name states.
[02:47:45.988 --> 02:47:47.289]  It needs to be an Infowar.
[02:47:47.289 --> 02:47:51.811]  We need them to be knowledgeable, because that's the biggest problem in this country right now, is ignorance.
[02:47:51.811 --> 02:48:02.858]  People are ignorant of the rules, they're ignorant of the law, and they think that when they see CNN, Comedy Central, and all these other stupid little media sources saying it's okay, they believe it, because they're just plain ignorant.
[02:48:02.858 --> 02:48:06.440]  Many videos that just state, you've been conned, you're in a trance.
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:07.981]  Comedy Central isn't your friend.
[02:48:08.601 --> 02:48:09.822]  They're lying to you.
[02:48:09.822 --> 02:48:12.285]  They're politically paid to do all this.
[02:48:12.285 --> 02:48:14.887]  Stewart's brother runs the New York Stock Exchange.
[02:48:14.887 --> 02:48:15.608]  This is a scam.
[02:48:15.608 --> 02:48:19.953]  Kind of like the end of Running Man when they go, Damon is lying to you and then show the lies.
[02:48:19.953 --> 02:48:20.994]  It's time to do it.
[02:48:22.093 --> 02:48:23.214]  That's right, absolutely.
[02:48:23.214 --> 02:48:24.234]  And it's not just enough.
[02:48:24.234 --> 02:48:34.460]  Even if people out there, like my call out was for people with these skills, even if you don't have those skills, people need to start having these conversations with people at the grocery store, at libraries, wherever you go.
[02:48:34.460 --> 02:48:35.400]  Start asking people.
[02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:39.022]  If you know somebody who is a Hillary supporter, ask them.
[02:48:39.022 --> 02:48:47.827]  Arm yourself with the knowledge of these other cases where people have been convicted and ask these people, why is it okay that these people are being convicted but she doesn't have to be?
[02:48:47.827 --> 02:48:49.148]  That she can be president.
[02:48:51.997 --> 02:48:58.381]  In 60 seconds, what would you say to one of these zombies to wake them up?
[02:48:58.381 --> 02:48:59.082]  I would ask them.
[02:48:59.082 --> 02:49:00.943]  I would say exactly like I just said.
[02:49:00.943 --> 02:49:04.545]  Say, look, we have multiple cases.
[02:49:04.545 --> 02:49:08.948]  You can't even have a full list of all the people who have been prosecuted.
[02:49:08.948 --> 02:49:14.352]  These people have been prosecuted for the same laws that she violated.
[02:49:14.352 --> 02:49:17.434]  Why is it okay for her, but not for them?
[02:49:18.286 --> 02:49:23.451]  Why is it that she can be president, but they have to be in jail?
[02:49:23.451 --> 02:49:27.656]  I handled classified material myself when I was in the Army.
[02:49:27.656 --> 02:49:33.502]  If I did what she did, I would be in a federal prison right now.
[02:49:33.502 --> 02:49:35.804]  It would have been an open and shut case.
[02:49:36.553 --> 02:49:40.996]  But she gets to be considered as President of the United States.
[02:49:40.996 --> 02:49:43.278]  That's because the globalists want a dictator.
[02:49:43.278 --> 02:49:45.420]  They want someone in who's an elected dictator.
[02:49:45.420 --> 02:49:47.201]  And people think, elected dictator?
[02:49:47.201 --> 02:49:47.702]  Yeah.
[02:49:47.702 --> 02:49:49.143]  A dictator just ignores the laws.
[02:49:49.143 --> 02:49:52.165]  They may be elected, but they begin to do whatever they want.
[02:49:52.165 --> 02:49:53.146]  And they're setting the stage.
[02:49:54.110 --> 02:49:59.412]  For Hillary to be a true dictator, that's exactly what the former senior service agent said, high level.
[02:49:59.412 --> 02:50:02.032]  He said, look, she wants a socialist dictatorship.
[02:50:02.032 --> 02:50:04.413]  And the average idiot hears that and goes, oh good, I'll get free stuff.
[02:50:04.413 --> 02:50:05.273]  No!
[02:50:05.273 --> 02:50:08.715]  You'll be made a domesticated slave of the system.
[02:50:08.715 --> 02:50:12.536]  God bless you, Sergeant B. I appreciate your call.
[02:50:12.536 --> 02:50:14.496]  And it's not the Republicans that are great either.
[02:50:14.496 --> 02:50:18.938]  That's why the Republican leadership has been against Trump.
[02:50:18.938 --> 02:50:19.638]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:50:22.571 --> 02:50:24.552]  This is the takedown of America.
[02:50:24.552 --> 02:50:33.997]  They take down your law in front of you and set the precedent they can do anything they want, whenever they want.
[02:50:33.997 --> 02:50:36.638]  Shane in Oregon, you're up next.
[02:50:36.638 --> 02:50:39.640]  Then we're going to talk to Justin X, Lana.
[02:50:41.260 --> 02:50:42.841]  Paul and others.
[02:50:42.841 --> 02:50:44.302]  You're listening to the GCN Radio Network.
[02:50:44.302 --> 02:50:46.883]  I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com.
[02:50:46.883 --> 02:50:48.404]  Please don't take the websites for granted.
[02:50:48.404 --> 02:50:50.105]  Please don't take the podcast for granted.
[02:50:50.105 --> 02:50:52.546]  Please don't take us being on this local station for granted.
[02:50:52.546 --> 02:50:55.588]  Because massive censorship is already taking place.
[02:50:55.588 --> 02:50:57.949]  Massive restrictions are already being launched.
[02:50:57.949 --> 02:50:59.050]  We're in serious trouble.
[02:51:00.051 --> 02:51:02.632]  Guys, are you tired of being tired?
[02:51:02.632 --> 02:51:06.093]  Frustrated because it seems impossible to lose belly fat?
[02:51:06.093 --> 02:51:09.013]  If you're looking for a solution, then listen to Mark.
[02:51:09.013 --> 02:51:12.714]  I had fantastic results with the Andro 400 Max.
[02:51:12.714 --> 02:51:14.935]  Probably lost 35 pounds.
[02:51:14.935 --> 02:51:20.777]  And more impressive than that was the inches I lost off of my belly and my waist.
[02:51:20.777 --> 02:51:23.377]  And the increased energy is fantastic.
[02:51:23.377 --> 02:51:25.938]  I'll be totally honest, I tried a different product.
[02:51:26.518 --> 02:51:29.042]  And I wasn't happy with the different products.
[02:51:29.042 --> 02:51:32.245]  You guys are considerably cheaper than the other brand.
[02:51:32.245 --> 02:51:35.229]  And I can really feel the difference.
[02:51:35.229 --> 02:51:36.130]  Andro 400 Max.
[02:51:36.130 --> 02:51:39.174]  The extra-strength, all-natural testosterone booster.
[02:51:39.174 --> 02:51:44.280]  The safe, easy and affordable way to gain energy and lose stubborn belly fat.

[02:52:59.898 --> 02:53:03.119]  At one point in my life, I just stopped going to church.
[02:53:03.119 --> 02:53:05.360]  I didn't care that much about religion.
[02:53:05.360 --> 02:53:11.401]  Some friends of mine encouraged me to pick up the Bible and then showed me that a lot of what I was taught was not even in the Bible.
[02:53:11.401 --> 02:53:14.622]  They showed me a website called thebiblesaysthat.org.
[02:53:14.622 --> 02:53:18.643]  The Q&A format was simple and it helped me find my own answers.
[02:53:18.643 --> 02:53:22.604]  This website challenges and dismantles misguided religious doctrines.
[02:53:22.604 --> 02:53:26.185]  Check out thebiblesaysthat.org and join the discussion.
[02:53:26.185 --> 02:53:27.046]  Thebiblesaysthat.org.

[02:54:05.264 --> 02:54:09.346]  Look, I'm going to go right back to your calls, but I want to just say something historical that's a known fact.
[02:54:09.346 --> 02:54:13.808]  Every historian, every sociologist, anthropologist knows this.
[02:54:13.808 --> 02:54:14.589]  Most of you know this.
[02:54:14.589 --> 02:54:19.711]  A lot of folks I talk to aren't aware of this, because they don't teach history anymore, real history.
[02:54:19.711 --> 02:54:28.616]  They just teach a bunch of guilt and hate the West, because the globalists are bringing in a technocracy that the Renaissance and the ideas of the West threaten.
[02:54:29.679 --> 02:54:32.061]  Not that the West was ever anywhere near perfect.
[02:54:32.061 --> 02:54:35.384]  My God, the West has done some of the worst stuff, okay?
[02:54:35.384 --> 02:54:38.026]  But we've also done some of the best stuff.
[02:54:38.026 --> 02:54:40.148]  That's a fact.
[02:54:40.148 --> 02:54:44.872]  Those that dare greatly also stoop down pretty low.
[02:54:44.872 --> 02:54:53.739]  So I don't lionize the West, I just know it has boldly done things for liberty and the expansion of human freedom that nobody else has done.
[02:54:55.009 --> 02:54:56.990]  There's been a lot of other great teachings from other parts of the world.
[02:54:56.990 --> 02:55:00.432]  A lot of amazing stuff from Asia, you name it.
[02:55:00.432 --> 02:55:03.874]  But at the end of the day, the West is the best, to quote Jim Morrison.
[02:55:03.874 --> 02:55:11.699]  The ideas are, the intellectual ideas, the open freedom, the people that actually delivered freedom instead of talking about it.
[02:55:11.699 --> 02:55:15.021]  And that's why the West is being killed.
[02:55:15.021 --> 02:55:16.062]  Beyond Westerners.
[02:55:17.594 --> 02:55:23.039]  The idea of the West is being gotten rid of by the globalists because it's in competition with them.
[02:55:23.039 --> 02:55:30.286]  Freedom, or the American system, which was one of the greatest examples of that, the elites a hundred years ago would openly write in newspapers, we've got to get rid of the American system.
[02:55:30.286 --> 02:55:31.868]  It can make anybody rich and powerful.
[02:55:31.868 --> 02:55:33.369]  It can make anybody successful.
[02:55:33.369 --> 02:55:34.770]  It makes people independent.
[02:55:34.770 --> 02:55:38.274]  It makes all these different groups out there that can do whatever they want.
[02:55:38.274 --> 02:55:41.597]  And centralized control, robber barons don't like that.
[02:55:43.496 --> 02:55:54.224]  And so these globalist CFR meetings and Bilderberg meetings and Club of Rome meetings and Davos meetings, they get together and they put out press statements about, we need to just dominate the public and openly make them slaves.
[02:55:54.224 --> 02:55:58.047]  Yeah, the public's all dumb, which you helped make dumb.
[02:55:58.047 --> 02:55:59.468]  You sit up there all arrogant.
[02:55:59.468 --> 02:56:00.929]  Most of you didn't even make your own money.
[02:56:00.929 --> 02:56:03.551]  You got it five, six generations back on average.
[02:56:03.551 --> 02:56:04.271]  That's on average.
[02:56:04.271 --> 02:56:10.096]  The average elitist today got their money five, six generations ago.
[02:56:10.096 --> 02:56:11.597]  Very few actually made it themselves.
[02:56:15.234 --> 02:56:20.276]  And so many of the elites, you see, like Bill Gates, are actually giving all of it as well.
[02:56:20.276 --> 02:56:22.678]  He's a total front guy.
[02:56:22.678 --> 02:56:25.859]  So what I'm getting at is this.
[02:56:25.859 --> 02:56:30.601]  Don't think Hillary is invincible because she thinks she's invincible and wants you to think she's invincible.
[02:56:30.601 --> 02:56:36.364]  That's her own delusion, which is a con game that if it's successful enough, might actually work on you.
[02:56:37.534 --> 02:56:39.996]  Well, this is megalomania, okay?
[02:56:39.996 --> 02:56:47.320]  Like, the more success and power I get, the more insecure I get, and the more I'm afraid to make a mistake because I don't want to hurt people.
[02:56:47.320 --> 02:56:48.941]  That's a normal grown-up thing.
[02:56:48.941 --> 02:56:52.663]  As you get more power and more responsibility, you get more careful.
[02:56:52.663 --> 02:56:54.885]  Not with elites in history when they're megalomaniacs.
[02:56:54.885 --> 02:56:57.927]  As they get more power, they feel more invincible.
[02:56:57.927 --> 02:56:59.868]  So don't think for all their arrogance that
[02:57:01.107 --> 02:57:02.868]  They won't be defeated.
[02:57:02.868 --> 02:57:13.436]  My only concern is, when they've dominated their domestic populations and have been found to be above the law, almost every case, they start wars with other people.
[02:57:13.436 --> 02:57:20.662]  And three times in the last 200 years, they've done it with Russia.
[02:57:20.662 --> 02:57:23.324]  Three times.
[02:57:23.324 --> 02:57:28.568]  Say which one about Russia, it hadn't been taken over yet, and it's just where empires go to start giant wars.
[02:57:28.568 --> 02:57:29.549]  Now there's nuclear weapons!
[02:57:31.055 --> 02:57:33.236]  Now our elite is allied with the Chinese.
[02:57:33.236 --> 02:57:34.277]  The Russians aren't stupid.
[02:57:34.277 --> 02:57:36.858]  They know there's a sneak attack plan with both countries to attack Russia.
[02:57:36.858 --> 02:57:38.079]  And I'm not lionizing Russia.
[02:57:38.079 --> 02:57:42.021]  I'm just saying it hasn't been taken over, except by the Communist Revolution, but still not completely.
[02:57:42.021 --> 02:57:43.222]  And then they overthrew that.
[02:57:43.222 --> 02:57:45.803]  So I'm really worried about Hillary, folks.
[02:57:45.803 --> 02:57:50.746]  Once she's got full control of the U.S., you watch, she's gonna turn her eyes outward.
[02:57:50.746 --> 02:57:57.470]  And as much as I kind of want her to leave us alone and move on, it's gonna come back on us, folks.
[02:57:57.470 --> 02:57:58.631]  You think Hitler was bad?
[02:58:00.230 --> 02:58:02.693]  Hillary is a complete lunatic.
[02:58:02.693 --> 02:58:07.518]  They've got nothing but women now running the State Department and most of the decisions of the Pentagon.
[02:58:07.518 --> 02:58:07.998]  And it's weird.
[02:58:07.998 --> 02:58:09.180]  None of them have been in combat.
[02:58:09.180 --> 02:58:10.841]  They all wear these fancy dresses.
[02:58:10.841 --> 02:58:14.345]  They get up there and make weird comments about how good they are at killing people.
[02:58:14.345 --> 02:58:15.967]  And then they just shoot their mouths off.
[02:58:15.967 --> 02:58:22.314]  I mean, it just reeks of nuclear war, reeks of defeat, reeks of hell.
[02:58:24.403 --> 02:58:29.364]  I mean, you've got a bunch of whacked out weirdos on a bunch of drugs and crap.
[02:58:29.364 --> 02:58:33.866]  I mean, I can look at Hillary and Samantha Powers and all of them and tell you, those women are on drugs if I've ever seen it.
[02:58:33.866 --> 02:58:36.547]  And they have got to be brought, they've got to be stopped, people.
[02:58:36.547 --> 02:58:37.527]  We've got to stop them!
[02:58:37.527 --> 02:58:39.888]  We're going to take a few more calls, hand the baton to Watson.
[02:58:39.888 --> 02:58:42.869]  I'm just telling you, we've got to stop these people.
[02:58:42.869 --> 02:58:44.809]  They're megalomaniacs.
[02:58:44.809 --> 02:58:47.530]  Before they stop themselves by blowing everything up.
[02:58:49.989 --> 02:58:58.171]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[02:58:58.171 --> 02:58:58.971]  Here's why.
[02:58:58.971 --> 02:59:03.133]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[02:59:03.133 --> 02:59:04.053]  So please listen.
[02:59:04.053 --> 02:59:07.754]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:59:07.754 --> 02:59:12.215]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases.
[02:59:12.295 --> 02:59:12.435]  I think?
[02:59:31.354 --> 02:59:33.215]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:05.697 --> 03:00:07.358]  The truth is a powerful thing.
[03:00:07.358 --> 03:00:12.301]  I suggest we use it.
[03:00:12.301 --> 03:00:17.963]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:00:17.963 --> 03:00:20.785]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:20.785 --> 03:00:22.686]  Alright, going right to your phone calls.
[03:00:24.861 --> 03:00:27.562]  I love how Trump's calling it a rigged system and it's all fraud.
[03:00:27.562 --> 03:00:28.483]  Because that's true.
[03:00:28.483 --> 03:00:32.725]  So you have to overthrow the entire corrupt system that's come in and taken over our country.
[03:00:32.725 --> 03:00:35.406]  You don't just debate with it and play games with it.
[03:00:35.406 --> 03:00:37.387]  You admit it's rigged, but Bernie Sanders won't do that.
[03:00:37.387 --> 03:00:41.149]  He's going to let Hillary rob him.
[03:00:41.149 --> 03:00:42.249]  Let's go to Shane in Oregon.
[03:00:42.249 --> 03:00:45.691]  Shane, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[03:00:45.691 --> 03:00:47.271]  Thank you for taking the call, Alex.
[03:00:47.271 --> 03:00:47.832]  Thank you.
[03:00:47.832 --> 03:00:50.553]  I'm a fairly new listener.
[03:00:50.553 --> 03:00:52.234]  I've just found you about a year and a half ago.
[03:00:53.625 --> 03:00:54.966]  I thank the good Lord that I did.
[03:00:54.966 --> 03:00:57.507]  I listen to you religiously.
[03:00:57.507 --> 03:01:03.652]  I drive for a living, so I listen to you all day while you're on live, and then I find you on YouTube and I've been watching you.
[03:01:03.652 --> 03:01:06.875]  Well, thanks for putting up with me, brother.
[03:01:06.875 --> 03:01:09.436]  First, I just want to say thank you again for everything you do.
[03:01:09.436 --> 03:01:11.898]  Your reporters are out of this world.
[03:01:11.898 --> 03:01:12.078]  They are.
[03:01:12.078 --> 03:01:19.884]  Everything that you guys are putting out there is just... I mean, I can't even explain how urgent this information is to get it out to the people.
[03:01:21.075 --> 03:01:30.181]  I'm a 13-year veteran of the United States Army, and I want to just say real quick, I had a lot of stuff I wanted to touch on.
[03:01:30.181 --> 03:01:31.362]  No, go ahead, go ahead.
[03:01:31.362 --> 03:01:32.062]  Take your time.
[03:01:32.062 --> 03:01:46.492]  I think this is really important that we the people, we need to stand behind Mr. Trump and really, really support him because he's basically put his entire life and family on the line.
[03:01:46.492 --> 03:01:48.354]  I think there's a good chance they're going to kill him.
[03:01:48.354 --> 03:01:50.275]  I'd say it's about a 50% chance they're going to kill him.
[03:01:51.874 --> 03:01:55.276]  They're so arrogant, they'll blow his plane up in front of everybody.
[03:01:55.276 --> 03:01:57.997]  I'm telling you, they'll do anything.
[03:01:57.997 --> 03:02:02.079]  Yeah, and unfortunately, I feel that same way.
[03:02:02.079 --> 03:02:08.742]  But, you know, we the people just really stand up and support him because he is the only hope that we have for this country to become great again.
[03:02:08.742 --> 03:02:09.662]  By the way, it just hit me.
[03:02:09.662 --> 03:02:10.763]  I think they want a civil war.
[03:02:10.763 --> 03:02:12.063]  They might kill Trump to start it.
[03:02:12.063 --> 03:02:14.424]  Oh, there's no end to these people.
[03:02:14.424 --> 03:02:16.365]  Yeah.
[03:02:16.365 --> 03:02:17.886]  And, you know, I think that
[03:02:18.777 --> 03:02:34.089]  One of the callers touched on something earlier, and I think Jakari also touched on it, that, you know, that what we're being fed, basically spoon-fed and being dumbed down through our, you know, mainstream media, that's all the people, you know, they think that's out there.
[03:02:34.089 --> 03:02:40.915]  And so, it's our job as the Uncle Warriors to, you know, put the information out there and help educate people, because I know since I found you,
[03:02:42.143 --> 03:02:50.750]  I've been, you know, baby stepping with my family and friends and at least getting them interested because that's half the battle, just catch someone's interest.
[03:02:50.750 --> 03:02:55.914]  Absolutely, and then as more tyranny comes in, unfortunately, down the road, they'll even wake up more.
[03:02:55.914 --> 03:02:59.137]  And baby steps are great sometimes with family because they're hard to wake up.
[03:02:59.137 --> 03:03:01.439]  I get people right in the face with the truth and just say, listen.
[03:03:02.139 --> 03:03:07.180]  You understand the globalists are taking this country over right now and they're trying to end our prosperity by design.
[03:03:07.180 --> 03:03:15.322]  We need to get involved to bring back just a basic system of Americana that produced the wealth and the success we had.
[03:03:15.322 --> 03:03:16.102]  God bless you, Shane.
[03:03:16.102 --> 03:03:17.183]  Good to hear from you.
[03:03:17.183 --> 03:03:18.303]  Let's take another call here.
[03:03:18.303 --> 03:03:26.025]  Let's talk to Justin X in the live free or die state of New Hampshire.
[03:03:26.025 --> 03:03:26.585]  Hello?
[03:03:26.585 --> 03:03:26.845]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:28.689 --> 03:03:33.010]  Yes, long time listener, first time caller.
[03:03:33.010 --> 03:03:43.814]  I felt compelled to call today because just like you, I have a powerful, sickening feeling in my gut and I don't know, it's not good.
[03:03:43.814 --> 03:03:49.175]  Last time I had this feeling was I was out of the country during the Boston bombing.
[03:03:49.175 --> 03:03:57.138]  As I'm flying in, I'm looking at the Golden Gate Bridge and I just get this sickening feeling in my gut.
[03:03:58.201 --> 03:04:03.762]  And come to find out, the people in Boston cheered the people that were dragging them out of their houses.
[03:04:03.762 --> 03:04:15.524]  So really, the only real solution is individual non-compliance with the edicts of self-employment.
[03:04:15.524 --> 03:04:15.984]  I agree.
[03:04:15.984 --> 03:04:16.724]  I agree.
[03:04:16.724 --> 03:04:21.185]  And more and more, we have to support local government and people when they're doing the right thing.
[03:04:21.185 --> 03:04:25.446]  But when systems are under globalist control and not, we have to absolutely not comply.
[03:04:25.446 --> 03:04:26.366]  It's now reached that point.
[03:04:27.324 --> 03:04:34.074]  I mean, yes, because we can hope for Trump to change things for us, but just like you just said, I question if there's even going to be an election.
[03:04:35.372 --> 03:04:36.873]  They're moving quickly.
[03:04:36.873 --> 03:04:39.714]  I don't know.
[03:04:39.714 --> 03:04:43.255]  I just have this feeling after seeing this, it's going to move exponentially.
[03:04:43.255 --> 03:04:43.515]  I agree.
[03:04:43.515 --> 03:04:44.675]  I mean, that's why I've said this.
[03:04:44.675 --> 03:04:47.376]  I've never said this in years of selling storable food.
[03:04:47.376 --> 03:04:50.077]  I've never said, now I believe you're going to actually need this for sure.
[03:04:50.077 --> 03:04:52.378]  I've never said, I'm getting a bunch extra for me.
[03:04:52.378 --> 03:04:54.058]  I mean, I really believe that.
[03:04:54.058 --> 03:04:55.939]  I just have a sickening feeling.
[03:04:55.939 --> 03:04:57.199]  My gut is, just get ready.
[03:04:57.199 --> 03:04:58.520]  Take care of your own family at this point.
[03:04:59.966 --> 03:05:03.611]  Let's face it, most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones.
[03:05:03.611 --> 03:05:08.397]  But recent studies link cell phone use to major health issues, including brain cancer.
[03:05:08.397 --> 03:05:12.142]  Experts say parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful.
[03:05:12.142 --> 03:05:16.288]  Doctors say the infant brain, even while in the womb, is especially vulnerable.
[03:05:16.408 --> 03:05:20.713]  So keep the phone away from your abdomen, especially toward the end of pregnancy.
[03:05:20.713 --> 03:05:26.239]  And for men, using a cell phone for as little as an hour a day is literally cooking your sperm.
[03:05:26.239 --> 03:05:30.864]  Lowering sperm count levels so much that conceiving a child could be difficult.
[03:05:30.864 --> 03:05:33.127]  This is one of those times you want to keep it out of your pants.
[03:05:33.507 --> 03:05:38.949]  And for those of us who use our cell phones before bed, know that the screen light is actually disrupting your sleep rhythms.
[03:05:38.949 --> 03:05:41.610]  This causes insomnia and slows the metabolism.
[03:05:41.610 --> 03:05:42.890]  Hello, weight gain!
[03:05:42.890 --> 03:05:47.992]  Generally speaking, when cell phones are on, they're constantly emitting radio frequency radiation.
[03:05:47.992 --> 03:05:50.273]  So keep your phone in airplane mode when you can.
[03:05:50.273 --> 03:05:52.874]  Keep the phone at least two feet away from your body.
[03:05:52.874 --> 03:05:53.814]  Use headphones.
[03:05:53.814 --> 03:05:57.115]  And when you're not on your phone, keep it as far away from you as possible.
[03:05:57.115 --> 03:05:59.176]  Leigh Ann McAdoo with your InfoWars Tip of the Week.

[03:06:59.682 --> 03:07:03.665]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[03:07:03.665 --> 03:07:09.969]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[03:07:09.969 --> 03:07:17.254]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[03:07:17.254 --> 03:07:26.040]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[03:07:26.340 --> 03:07:32.526]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[03:07:32.526 --> 03:07:37.350]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[03:07:37.350 --> 03:07:40.933]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[03:07:40.933 --> 03:07:42.835]  No needles, no injections.
[03:07:42.835 --> 03:07:44.496]  Don't take my word for it.
[03:07:44.496 --> 03:07:45.678]  Try it for yourself.
[03:07:45.678 --> 03:07:48.000]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[03:07:54.266 --> 03:08:03.216]  InfoWarsLife Secret 12.
[03:08:03.216 --> 03:08:05.078]  We are on the march.
[03:08:05.078 --> 03:08:08.241]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:08:08.241 --> 03:08:11.926]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:16.289 --> 03:08:29.420]  We have global combines that have taken control of most of the planet, have successfully overthrown nation after nation, openly doing banker bail-ins in Europe, flooding the countries with 5 million foreigners, covering up their mass rapes, you name it.
[03:08:29.420 --> 03:08:37.766]  I've got articles here where in London, Islamist Muslim cab driver says it's against his religion to take blind man with a guide dog.
[03:08:37.766 --> 03:08:41.089]  And the person tells him, well, it violates the Disabilities Act.
[03:08:41.089 --> 03:08:42.190]  He says, I don't care.
[03:08:42.190 --> 03:08:43.771]  And nothing will be done to him for that.
[03:08:43.771 --> 03:08:44.812]  They are above the law.
[03:08:44.812 --> 03:08:45.593]  They are gods.
[03:08:46.209 --> 03:08:50.255]  That's why they don't have to wear, they don't get searched by the TSA, you name it.
[03:08:50.255 --> 03:08:52.878]  And again, people say, well you didn't used to be so Islamophobic.
[03:08:52.878 --> 03:08:55.842]  I didn't want to destabilize the Middle East and have a giant war.
[03:08:55.842 --> 03:09:02.872]  The point is they're bringing people in from the most backward, third world hell pits, where many women aren't even allowed out of the house.
[03:09:03.851 --> 03:09:14.662]  And then there's all these weird, sickening feminist groups out attacking me saying I'm Islamophobic with weirdo, like 18-year-old girls with their faces painted up saying I'm a feminist screaming to defend the Muslims.
[03:09:14.662 --> 03:09:19.366]  I mean, it is literal mental suicide they're engaged in.
[03:09:19.366 --> 03:09:22.409]  It is the opposite of logic.
[03:09:22.409 --> 03:09:25.852]  I don't understand how we manufactured such freak shows.
[03:09:26.633 --> 03:09:37.801]  And then we've got, I'm sure Paul's getting into this because it's his beat, you know, exposing it, you know, this leader in Sweden saying, well, when our men rape women, it's bad, even though they're like less than 10% of the rapes.
[03:09:37.801 --> 03:09:40.303]  But when the Muslims do it, it's just their culture.
[03:09:40.303 --> 03:09:41.804]  This is where we're going.
[03:09:41.804 --> 03:09:44.106]  Now, we've got some calls here that have been holding a while.
[03:09:44.106 --> 03:09:46.308]  That's why I held over so I could go to those.
[03:09:46.308 --> 03:09:48.389]  I was going to talk to Paul and Stormy and Lana.
[03:09:48.389 --> 03:09:49.910]  In fact, Lana's here in a moment.
[03:09:49.910 --> 03:09:50.491]  But briefly,
[03:09:52.506 --> 03:09:53.607]  It's time to get prepared.
[03:09:53.607 --> 03:10:02.571]  That's why we're running a special 20 to 40% off on this super high quality, super fresh, last 25 year, storable foods at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:10:02.571 --> 03:10:06.933]  We're going to extend the Independence Day sale through this week because it's about being independent.
[03:10:06.933 --> 03:10:12.816]  20% off on water filtration systems, on air filtration systems, and so much more at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:10:13.976 --> 03:10:17.918]  Or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:10:17.918 --> 03:10:23.302]  Also, when you buy the Hillary for Prison shirts, we have a new limited edition out.
[03:10:23.302 --> 03:10:30.206]  That will go to pay for the airplanes that we're going to have with big banners over the RNC and DNC with giant banners that say Hillary for Prison.
[03:10:31.448 --> 03:10:33.389]  And it doesn't mean InfoWars is going to save the world.
[03:10:33.389 --> 03:10:37.490]  You buying the shirt won't be the straw that breaks the camel's back of tyranny.
[03:10:37.490 --> 03:10:40.231]  But let me tell you, somebody will push us over the edge.
[03:10:40.231 --> 03:10:41.491]  And its resistance is victory.
[03:10:41.491 --> 03:10:44.912]  So InfoWarsStore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:10:44.912 --> 03:10:47.553]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:10:47.553 --> 03:10:51.854]  But even more important, send out the links to the podcast.
[03:10:51.854 --> 03:10:53.675]  Send out the video links to the live show.
[03:10:53.675 --> 03:10:56.155]  Tell people about that local AM or FM affiliate you listen to.
[03:10:56.155 --> 03:10:57.996]  Become a sponsor at a local station.
[03:10:57.996 --> 03:10:59.376]  Support the sponsors.
[03:10:59.376 --> 03:11:00.117]  Send $100 to the station.
[03:11:01.602 --> 03:11:06.466]  Send links to videos and articles and information to friends and family.
[03:11:06.466 --> 03:11:07.807]  It's an info war.
[03:11:07.807 --> 03:11:10.449]  They admit we're one of the most prominent groups hurting them.
[03:11:10.449 --> 03:11:14.212]  It goes drudge, info wars, and down the line from there.
[03:11:14.212 --> 03:11:18.215]  We are now the symbol of independent, liberty-based, populist media worldwide.
[03:11:18.215 --> 03:11:19.956]  We're changing the world.
[03:11:19.956 --> 03:11:23.199]  Nizel Farage used to come on like 15 years ago.
[03:11:23.199 --> 03:11:26.822]  He came on just a few years ago as well, and he admitted, wow, you're really big over here in England.
[03:11:26.822 --> 03:11:28.383]  You're getting us a lot of UKIP members.
[03:11:28.383 --> 03:11:29.304]  I'm proud of that.
[03:11:30.049 --> 03:11:31.810]  I'm proud of you.
[03:11:31.810 --> 03:11:33.672]  We're all in this together, so don't thank me.
[03:11:33.672 --> 03:11:34.953]  I want to thank you.
[03:11:34.953 --> 03:11:35.873]  We're in this together.
[03:11:35.873 --> 03:11:37.775]  Paul Watson, a lot going on.
[03:11:37.775 --> 03:11:38.796]  Tell us what's coming up today.
[03:11:38.796 --> 03:11:40.417]  Obviously, you're talking about Hillary.
[03:11:40.417 --> 03:11:48.443]  I mean, I see this as the elite breaking away from justice completely and a declaration of independence against the rule of law, a declaration of dictatorship, Paul.
[03:11:49.833 --> 03:12:00.297]  Well, it's completely brazen, Alex, and I mean, the meeting itself with Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton, a lot of people speculated that Bill Clinton did that because he could.
[03:12:00.297 --> 03:12:02.398]  He didn't even care about the optics.
[03:12:02.398 --> 03:12:04.478]  He didn't care how bad it would look.
[03:12:04.478 --> 03:12:08.300]  And you know, this is what you talked about earlier, the brazenness of the elite.
[03:12:08.300 --> 03:12:11.701]  You know, there was a tweet from Hillary Clinton back in January.
[03:12:11.701 --> 03:12:16.703]  There should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too big to jail.
[03:12:17.583 --> 03:12:19.404]  Well that's been disproven today.
[03:12:19.404 --> 03:12:23.888]  You had Comey lay out for 15 minutes how she had broken the law.
[03:12:23.888 --> 03:12:31.334]  We've got numerous examples from past cases about how people did exactly this, mishandling the classified information.
[03:12:31.334 --> 03:12:32.835]  They were punished for it.
[03:12:32.835 --> 03:12:37.859]  So he laid it out how she broke the law and then concluded that she was above the law.
[03:12:38.797 --> 03:12:51.167]  I mean, this is scary because people are already out saying, well, if the highest elected representatives in the country are immune from the law or above the law, then why should I pay my taxes?
[03:12:51.167 --> 03:12:53.229]  Why should I follow the law?
[03:12:53.229 --> 03:12:57.973]  So it could lead, I mean, eventually down the line to some form of civil unrest.
[03:12:57.973 --> 03:13:02.156]  That's how Mexico had super low crime 50 years ago and degenerated.
[03:13:02.156 --> 03:13:04.258]  The public sees the government not following the law.
[03:13:04.258 --> 03:13:06.059]  That's what makes civilizations fall, Paul.
[03:13:06.059 --> 03:13:06.600]  That's a good point.
[03:13:07.967 --> 03:13:08.627]  No, exactly.
[03:13:08.627 --> 03:13:15.970]  They see that the highest elected representatives in the land have no appreciation for and are protected from the law.
[03:13:15.970 --> 03:13:17.451]  So how do they behave?
[03:13:17.451 --> 03:13:18.291]  How do they respond?
[03:13:18.291 --> 03:13:19.112]  We've already seen it.
[03:13:19.112 --> 03:13:26.555]  There's an article up on Infowars where I collated some of the comments just off Twitter and some other websites of people responding to this.
[03:13:26.555 --> 03:13:32.037]  Absolute, unremitting fury from people saying that this is the end of the line for them.
[03:13:32.037 --> 03:13:35.219]  They've tolerated enough and this is just a step too far.
[03:13:35.979 --> 03:13:41.119]  But you know, I'm going to get into the previous cases when I get up and host the show in a little while.
[03:13:42.569 --> 03:13:45.431]  Numerous cases where people have done exactly this.
[03:13:45.431 --> 03:13:47.612]  Mishandle classified information.
[03:13:47.612 --> 03:13:49.012]  Not even deliberately.
[03:13:49.012 --> 03:13:51.873]  Remember, that's not the standard that she's being held to.
[03:13:51.873 --> 03:13:53.294]  Not deliberately.
[03:13:53.294 --> 03:13:56.555]  And yet we have Comey coming out with this quote.
[03:13:56.555 --> 03:13:57.196]  Again, quote.
[03:13:57.196 --> 03:14:03.879]  To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences.
[03:14:03.879 --> 03:14:08.681]  To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions.
[03:14:09.281 --> 03:14:13.286]  So again, they're subject to misdemeanor charges, fines, imprisonment.
[03:14:13.286 --> 03:14:13.946]  He warns them.
[03:14:13.946 --> 03:14:16.990]  He said, listen, just because she's not getting in trouble doesn't mean you won't.
[03:14:16.990 --> 03:14:21.916]  They're even telling the government she's above the law and that they aren't.
[03:14:21.916 --> 03:14:22.957]  That's crazy, man.
[03:14:24.343 --> 03:14:25.944]  It's completely out of control.
[03:14:25.944 --> 03:14:32.610]  I mean, even a lot of people on the left, from what I've seen, are just absolutely flabbergasted by this.
[03:14:32.610 --> 03:14:42.537]  The one crumb of comfort, I guess, for Trump, which some people have pointed out, is that, you know, 2016 is the year of complete rebellion against the status quo.
[03:14:42.537 --> 03:14:50.504]  This is not only going to fire up his base, but it's also going to enrage those independents who are leaning Republican to vote for Trump.
[03:14:51.144 --> 03:14:56.369]  It's going to influence the Bernie Sanders supporters, 50% of whom said they wouldn't vote for Hillary.
[03:14:56.369 --> 03:14:57.069]  Here's the good news.
[03:14:57.069 --> 03:14:59.111]  Trump doesn't even know what an email server is.
[03:14:59.111 --> 03:15:00.212]  That's kind of a good thing.
[03:15:00.212 --> 03:15:02.033]  It's emails handed to him, printed off.
[03:15:02.033 --> 03:15:04.896]  He knows how to use a Twitter.
[03:15:04.896 --> 03:15:08.199]  Don't worry, he won't have any secret servers because he's not a big tech guy.
[03:15:08.199 --> 03:15:09.620]  I tell you, Hillary is a true slimeball.
[03:15:09.620 --> 03:15:11.542]  I want to take a call or two and hand the baton to you, Paul.
[03:15:13.021 --> 03:15:14.862]  I think this just signifies the battle lines.
[03:15:14.862 --> 03:15:15.942]  They're going into overdrive.
[03:15:15.942 --> 03:15:16.863]  They have nothing to lose.
[03:15:16.863 --> 03:15:17.803]  They're cornered.
[03:15:17.803 --> 03:15:19.404]  Humanity's waking up.
[03:15:19.404 --> 03:15:21.845]  This is just an epic time to be alive.
[03:15:21.845 --> 03:15:25.286]  But what do you think Hillary's going to do if she actually gets in?
[03:15:25.286 --> 03:15:27.607]  My bigger concern isn't that she'll just persecute us.
[03:15:27.607 --> 03:15:28.228]  We know that's coming.
[03:15:28.228 --> 03:15:29.228]  That's already happened.
[03:15:29.228 --> 03:15:31.169]  I've already been under Bill and Hillary before.
[03:15:32.102 --> 03:15:33.723]  And enjoyed it, let me tell you.
[03:15:33.723 --> 03:15:39.205]  It's always fun to get knocked upside the head by a bunch of thugs attacking you so you don't talk about the Clintons if they punch you.
[03:15:39.205 --> 03:15:41.286]  But I punched back, that's what they found out.
[03:15:41.286 --> 03:15:44.007]  So I guess they didn't come back.
[03:15:44.007 --> 03:15:48.590]  But side issue, Paul, what do you think she's going to do when she gets in?
[03:15:48.590 --> 03:15:56.353]  I think she might start World War III because this instinct to dominate and rule everyone, this megalomania in her is so strong.
[03:15:56.353 --> 03:15:57.914]  I mean, the dark side is strong in this one.
[03:15:59.281 --> 03:16:03.529]  No, I mean, that is the fear that she could amp up this Cold War situation with Russia.
[03:16:03.529 --> 03:16:05.273]  By the way, the Russians say that.
[03:16:05.273 --> 03:16:06.916]  They say she may be the worst president ever.
[03:16:06.916 --> 03:16:10.623]  They absolutely, in their analysis, think Hillary is just like the frickin' Antichrist.
[03:16:11.460 --> 03:16:20.463]  Oh no, I mean Putin said words to that effect a couple of weeks ago, and he said he could probably get along with Trump, but Hillary is just a frightening prospect.
[03:16:20.463 --> 03:16:27.066]  You've got the South China Sea situation with, you know, China saying that it's not afraid of a military confrontation once again.
[03:16:27.066 --> 03:16:29.287]  So she could exploit that.
[03:16:29.287 --> 03:16:32.508]  The country's going to be massively divided if she gets in.
[03:16:32.508 --> 03:16:36.209]  She could rally everyone around by using the old excuses.
[03:16:36.209 --> 03:16:40.091]  How are the Chinese going to act when she's on their payroll, on record?
[03:16:40.911 --> 03:16:45.074]  Because Kenneth Starr was on the payroll of the same group, he never went after her for that, Special Prosecutor.
[03:16:45.074 --> 03:16:51.459]  How are they going to act knowing that she's been basically a communist Chinese agent for 20 years?
[03:16:51.459 --> 03:16:54.942]  Well, she's going to get protected by the media, so it's not even going to be a big issue.
[03:16:54.942 --> 03:17:01.847]  I mean, you've got the media flapping their gums about Trump tweeting a star in a Hillary Clinton meeting.
[03:17:01.847 --> 03:17:07.251]  By the way, that's one of the four or five stars they use when they say, like, discount on a box, a cereal box.
[03:17:09.338 --> 03:17:10.039]  Exactly.
[03:17:10.039 --> 03:17:13.563]  Well, it was seen on a white supremacist website.
[03:17:13.563 --> 03:17:21.293]  Well, you know, my videos are posted on white supremacist websites, but white supremacists and neo-Nazis are the prominent people who attack me.
[03:17:21.293 --> 03:17:27.261]  The point is, that symbol, the way they did it, orange like that or whatever, is the symbol that the police use, everybody else uses.
[03:17:27.261 --> 03:17:28.142]  It just means, look here.
[03:17:29.480 --> 03:17:31.722]  Yeah, totally, totally innocent.
[03:17:31.722 --> 03:17:41.111]  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, the country that executes gay people and throws them in prison, is funding 20% of Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[03:17:41.111 --> 03:17:43.172]  Nobody gives a damn about that.
[03:17:43.172 --> 03:17:44.314]  That's not offensive.
[03:17:44.314 --> 03:17:48.257]  What's offensive is a red star in a meme about Hillary Clinton.
[03:17:48.257 --> 03:17:49.999]  My God, I'm so offended.
[03:17:52.284 --> 03:17:53.385]  Well, it's amazing.
[03:17:53.385 --> 03:17:54.546]  It's absolutely amazing.
[03:17:54.546 --> 03:17:58.329]  And they're going to try these stunts over and over and over and over and over again.
[03:17:58.329 --> 03:18:01.532]  And, you know, the left gets mad at us putting up this Ben Garrison deal.
[03:18:01.532 --> 03:18:03.713]  He exposed Bush, by the way, with I'm with Herb.
[03:18:05.004 --> 03:18:10.587]  The grim reaper with Hillary showing Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and they say, oh, you didn't care about Bush.
[03:18:10.587 --> 03:18:12.148]  Yes, we did.
[03:18:12.148 --> 03:18:13.309]  And we were against those wars.
[03:18:13.309 --> 03:18:23.014]  But even mainline historians say Hillary's far worse, and Obama launching a whole bunch of new wars, and they're financing anti-Christian groups that are killing hundreds of thousands of Christians!
[03:18:23.014 --> 03:18:25.215]  I mean, Bush didn't do that!
[03:18:25.215 --> 03:18:28.437]  Bush protected Christians in Iraq, as bad as he is!
[03:18:28.437 --> 03:18:30.738]  It's like, why do you think she's out to get Christians like this?
[03:18:30.738 --> 03:18:31.739]  I just can't figure it out.
[03:18:32.827 --> 03:18:37.993]  Well, I mean, it's the policy of the administration, the Syrian refugees they've brought in.
[03:18:37.993 --> 03:18:47.143]  It's literally, you know, 99.5% Muslim, even though Syria, if you were doing it on that basis, you know, around 10% would be Christian, just on a neutral basis.
[03:18:48.024 --> 03:18:50.525]  Yes, it's closer to 20.
[03:18:50.525 --> 03:18:55.766]  So you've got the guy involved in the Istanbul bombing being a refugee protected by the EU.
[03:18:55.766 --> 03:19:05.109]  Now the US is importing these people and they seem to be deliberately importing Muslims over Christians while refusing to even mention the term Islamic terrorism.
[03:19:05.729 --> 03:19:13.534]  By the way, if I see some guy in one of these Santa Claus outfits refusing a blind person a ride because they got a seeing eye dog, I'm going to get mad.
[03:19:13.534 --> 03:19:19.797]  At a certain point, you know, once we get enough Muslims in the country, they start blowing stuff up to make us submit to them.
[03:19:19.797 --> 03:19:23.879]  But again, the leftists hate America so much, they love it, man!
[03:19:23.879 --> 03:19:25.340]  God Almighty!
[03:19:25.340 --> 03:19:27.862]  The spoiled brats, Paul!
[03:19:28.916 --> 03:19:31.260]  Well you shot a video about America's greatest country in history.
[03:19:31.260 --> 03:19:32.902]  It has been the greatest country in history.
[03:19:32.902 --> 03:19:37.630]  Doesn't mean we're not mad at a bunch of stuff that's gone on, but we don't just have it out for the country.
[03:19:39.371 --> 03:19:41.032]  And all these people that hate it, man!
[03:19:41.032 --> 03:19:42.893]  Get your asses out!
[03:19:42.893 --> 03:19:44.254]  Get the hell out!
[03:19:44.254 --> 03:19:44.814]  I'm sorry!
[03:19:44.814 --> 03:19:57.941]  I mean, I look at one more slack-jawed, white, yuppie, 25-year-old, with a thousand-dollar, you know, fancy iPhone, pulling up in a fancy car their parents gave them, in a Mercedes, wearing a Bernie Sanders shirt.
[03:19:57.941 --> 03:20:01.222]  I mean, I just, I just cannot handle it, man!
[03:20:01.222 --> 03:20:04.584]  You know how many people I see driving around in fancy cars with Bernie Sanders stickers, Paul?
[03:20:06.258 --> 03:20:12.886]  I mean, communist countries and socialist countries can't even manufacture cars, dumbass!
[03:20:12.886 --> 03:20:14.589]  Look at Cuba, dumbass!
[03:20:14.589 --> 03:20:17.472]  They can't make a car, you stupid idiots!
[03:20:17.472 --> 03:20:18.573]  Look at North Korea!
[03:20:18.573 --> 03:20:19.495]  Sorry, Paul, go ahead.
[03:20:20.640 --> 03:20:25.601]  Look at Venezuela, they have to have signs on the trucks saying there's no food in it so it doesn't get looted.
[03:20:25.601 --> 03:20:28.842]  I mean, fantastic, again, benefits of socialism.
[03:20:28.842 --> 03:20:34.424]  But the left is aligned with Islamists, because as you said, they both hate America.
[03:20:34.424 --> 03:20:36.264]  This is not just a cliche, it's true.
[03:20:36.264 --> 03:20:38.945]  This is why ISIS in its own manifesto say
[03:20:39.585 --> 03:20:47.187]  That we're going to go out and hire leftists, radicalize them, and give them weapons because we broadly share the same goal.
[03:20:47.187 --> 03:20:50.468]  And that goal is to tear down the existing structure.
[03:20:50.468 --> 03:20:53.989]  Whether it's good or bad, it's to tear down the status quo.
[03:20:53.989 --> 03:20:56.910]  That means your constitutional rights in the process.
[03:20:56.910 --> 03:20:58.030]  And I've got news for you!
[03:20:58.030 --> 03:21:01.131]  The only structure that works is free market dummies.
[03:21:01.131 --> 03:21:05.592]  We lose this, the carrying capacity falls, we're going to have billions that starve to death, you morons!
[03:21:06.772 --> 03:21:08.494]  That's what they want to remove.
[03:21:08.494 --> 03:21:13.020]  It goes back to the Frankfurt School, which of course created political correctness.
[03:21:13.020 --> 03:21:14.802]  It goes back to Marxism.
[03:21:14.802 --> 03:21:23.993]  It goes back to this idea of critical theory and Saul Alinsky, where they just want to tear down absolutely everything in this kind of nihilist purge.
[03:21:24.574 --> 03:21:26.856]  And socialists want to do that, so do Islamists.
[03:21:26.856 --> 03:21:29.257]  That's why they feed off of each other.
[03:21:29.257 --> 03:21:35.301]  That's why socialists and liberals defend Islamists, because again, they broadly share the same goals.
[03:21:35.301 --> 03:21:40.425]  And now ISIS has actually recognized this, and is going out and trying to hire these people.
[03:21:40.425 --> 03:21:45.848]  Wow, I mean, I knew that was... Well, there's the headline, ISIS admits alliance with the left.
[03:21:45.848 --> 03:21:47.369]  Wow, is there a story on this?
[03:21:47.369 --> 03:21:48.190]  This is sensational.
[03:21:48.190 --> 03:21:52.573]  Yeah, I mean, I wrote the story months ago, and this is all you're going to see.
[03:21:52.573 --> 03:21:54.034]  People need to know this, because I'm telling you, man,
[03:21:55.055 --> 03:21:55.675]  Here's the deal.
[03:21:55.675 --> 03:22:01.302]  Disliking problems in America and crony capitalism is good and should be done.
[03:22:01.302 --> 03:22:05.046]  But I'm telling you, socialists and globalists are going to deliver us into hell.
[03:22:05.046 --> 03:22:08.611]  They are not the answer to reforming the West even more.
[03:22:08.611 --> 03:22:10.954]  We want to get better, not go back to this.
[03:22:13.100 --> 03:22:14.281]  No, exactly.
[03:22:14.281 --> 03:22:19.423]  And the other issue with this election coming up, again, they could get some radical leftists.
[03:22:19.423 --> 03:22:23.986]  We've already seen people jumping up on the stage trying to attack Trump.
[03:22:23.986 --> 03:22:31.029]  We've seen an assassination attempt against Trump just a few weeks ago, got barely any media attention whatsoever.
[03:22:31.029 --> 03:22:35.331]  This guy tries to grab an officer's gun, go up and shoot Trump in the head.
[03:22:35.331 --> 03:22:38.333]  The story was buried within 48 hours.
[03:22:38.333 --> 03:22:40.494]  If someone did that at, you know, a Hillary event,
[03:22:40.874 --> 03:22:42.235]  It would be in the news for three weeks.
[03:22:42.235 --> 03:22:47.340]  Dangerous right-wing radical Republicans trying to kill Hillary Clinton.
[03:22:47.340 --> 03:22:50.343]  Trump has had numerous assassination attempts.
[03:22:50.343 --> 03:22:53.245]  That's why he wears a bulletproof vest at every public event.
[03:22:53.245 --> 03:22:56.569]  That's why he doesn't button his suit top up.
[03:22:56.569 --> 03:22:59.011]  And again, the media doesn't talk about it.
[03:22:59.011 --> 03:23:02.914]  The other issue that's bubbling under the surface, which I'm going to write an article about, is
[03:23:03.675 --> 03:23:20.365]  Facebook, there's now speculation from experts that Facebook is going to manipulate their feed, their algorithm, on the day of the election to encourage certain people within democratic districts to go out and vote because of course there are, you know, if there's a low turnout they need to encourage that.
[03:23:20.825 --> 03:23:30.219]  They're now powerful enough, and we've covered the stories before, Facebook has done tests, studies, experiments on the general public to manipulate their emotions.
[03:23:30.219 --> 03:23:34.966]  Facebook is now more powerful than a lot of countries even in the Western world.
[03:23:34.966 --> 03:23:36.448]  And Zuckerberg is the dictator of it!
[03:23:37.199 --> 03:23:45.106]  And they're talking about using that algorithm to manipulate people on the day of the presidential election to go out and vote for Hillary Clinton.
[03:23:45.106 --> 03:23:50.210]  This is not me saying it, this is a top author, an expert, so we're going to have that story coming up as well.
[03:23:55.020 --> 03:23:58.262]  All I can say is, folks, you want to be part of history.
[03:23:58.262 --> 03:24:00.163]  Spread the video and audio links today.
[03:24:00.163 --> 03:24:03.745]  Spread the link to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:24:03.745 --> 03:24:05.265]  Support our local stations.
[03:24:05.265 --> 03:24:07.366]  Thank them for carrying the show.
[03:24:07.366 --> 03:24:10.528]  It's your support that ends up getting us moving from the weekend to weeknights to live.
[03:24:10.528 --> 03:24:14.570]  Most stations end up moving us to live because they have to support the ratings and things they need.
[03:24:14.570 --> 03:24:15.931]  We're winning in the Infowar.
[03:24:16.311 --> 03:24:19.814]  The globalists want to overthrow that because they can't beat us fair and square.
[03:24:19.814 --> 03:24:21.835]  So, don't take this show for granted.
[03:24:21.835 --> 03:24:24.778]  I tell myself that every night when I go to bed, every day when I get up.
[03:24:24.778 --> 03:24:25.638]  Work hard today.
[03:24:25.638 --> 03:24:28.541]  Be as absolutely hardcore as you can.
[03:24:28.541 --> 03:24:30.142]  Bust your ass, Jones.
[03:24:30.142 --> 03:24:31.123]  Don't play games.
[03:24:31.123 --> 03:24:32.144]  This is history.
[03:24:32.144 --> 03:24:35.206]  You're betting your life, your treasure, your sacred honor on this.
[03:24:35.206 --> 03:24:36.787]  You better kick butt.
[03:24:36.787 --> 03:24:37.027]  Okay?
[03:24:37.027 --> 03:24:39.710]  I mean, I am in my face every day like a drill sergeant.
[03:24:40.595 --> 03:24:43.316]  And all I'm asking you is to realize this is history happening right now.
[03:24:43.316 --> 03:24:44.576]  This isn't a game.
[03:24:44.576 --> 03:24:49.297]  And we will beat these people as our ancestors have beaten parasites and collectivists before.
[03:24:49.297 --> 03:24:51.838]  But it's going to be rough.
[03:24:51.838 --> 03:24:55.539]  And if we don't fight hard, folks, it's going to get really bad before it gets better.
[03:24:55.539 --> 03:24:57.299]  Because they'll always destroy themselves in the end.
[03:24:57.299 --> 03:25:01.340]  But my God, with the weapons we've got and things like that now, we do not want to go down this road.
[03:25:01.340 --> 03:25:02.360]  This is historic.
[03:25:02.360 --> 03:25:03.481]  This is dangerous.
[03:25:03.481 --> 03:25:04.801]  But we're winning major battles.
[03:25:04.801 --> 03:25:06.061]  We're starting to win the war.
[03:25:06.061 --> 03:25:08.222]  Look at the British situation and the Brexit.
[03:25:09.082 --> 03:25:12.825]  All I'm saying is spread the word about the broadcast today.
[03:25:12.825 --> 03:25:13.725]  Send those links out.
[03:25:13.725 --> 03:25:18.629]  The power of you, the activists of this transmission, you're the reason it's spreading so fast already.
[03:25:18.629 --> 03:25:19.610]  And the great team we've got.
[03:25:19.610 --> 03:25:21.051]  It works together like a horse and carriage.
[03:25:21.051 --> 03:25:24.113]  But you are 99% of the power.
[03:25:24.113 --> 03:25:25.934]  We're just the detonator.
[03:25:25.934 --> 03:25:26.975]  You are the explosive.
[03:25:28.163 --> 03:25:29.704]  Infowars is the detonator.
[03:25:29.704 --> 03:25:32.226]  You are the explosive.
[03:25:32.226 --> 03:25:36.508]  And then you're also the detonator to detonate the explosive in your area.
[03:25:36.508 --> 03:25:38.170]  So you're the explosive and the detonator.
[03:25:38.170 --> 03:25:39.690]  You are everything.
[03:25:39.690 --> 03:25:43.933]  And we need you to detonate information warfare weapons of truth in your area.
[03:25:43.933 --> 03:25:44.994]  People are ready to hear the truth.
[03:25:44.994 --> 03:25:46.935]  We need you to detonate.
[03:25:46.935 --> 03:25:53.940]  If you're an engineer and have the skills, and there's no local affiliate, Micro-FM, AM, UHF, VHF, don't play games.
[03:25:54.895 --> 03:25:57.057]  Whatever you gotta do, folks.
[03:25:57.057 --> 03:25:58.178]  We're not playing around.
[03:25:58.178 --> 03:26:00.139]  We gotta get hardcore.
[03:26:00.139 --> 03:26:06.164]  I launched a movement of micro-FMs back in the mid-90s that I know got thousands of stations put up.
[03:26:06.164 --> 03:26:08.606]  So, we're ready.
[03:26:08.606 --> 03:26:12.430]  We're ready to fight the info war because that's affecting the future battle space.
[03:26:12.430 --> 03:26:14.291]  That's almost all of war today.
[03:26:14.291 --> 03:26:16.593]  The Pentagon says it's informational.
[03:26:16.593 --> 03:26:21.918]  The average person at the Pentagon is awake, rooting for us, but commanded by enemy globalists.
[03:26:21.918 --> 03:26:22.258]  Literally.
[03:26:23.888 --> 03:26:25.329]  This is historic, what's happening.
[03:26:25.329 --> 03:26:26.549]  You are the resistance.
[03:26:26.549 --> 03:26:30.991]  That isn't some rhetoric, you know, like, oh, I'm the resistance, you know.
[03:26:30.991 --> 03:26:32.811]  You're beginning to see, this is real.
[03:26:32.811 --> 03:26:36.512]  When I say from deep behind enemy lines in occupied North America, I'm not playing around.
[03:26:36.512 --> 03:26:40.234]  Lana in North Carolina, thanks for holding her on the air, with Paul Watson and myself.
[03:26:40.234 --> 03:26:41.954]  Go ahead.
[03:26:41.954 --> 03:26:52.178]  Hey, Alex, it's such a privilege to talk to you, and I love all your journalists, and I forward all of your articles on Instagram.
[03:26:52.905 --> 03:26:57.428]  And I tell people about tragedy and Hope 101.
[03:26:57.428 --> 03:27:08.395]  But what I wanted to ask you, you and your journalist were touching on it a minute ago, it's so stupid for the globalists to tear us down, and I know they're really smart,
[03:27:08.908 --> 03:27:11.270]  But what I don't understand is why are they doing that?
[03:27:11.270 --> 03:27:18.315]  Because once they do that, they're not going to have anybody to buy all of their luxury items, like their BMW.
[03:27:18.315 --> 03:27:19.096]  Sure, sure, sure.
[03:27:19.096 --> 03:27:20.937]  That's only one division of what they've done.
[03:27:20.937 --> 03:27:22.218]  It's a great point.
[03:27:22.218 --> 03:27:24.120]  This is the key to everything we've just asked.
[03:27:24.700 --> 03:27:26.441]  They have bad will towards you.
[03:27:26.441 --> 03:27:32.105]  Elites don't like, even if they're worth a hundred billion dollars, they don't like you with a nice swimming pool, going on nice vacations.
[03:27:32.105 --> 03:27:33.826]  They go to the Grand Canyon and see you there.
[03:27:33.826 --> 03:27:35.487]  They write books about it and complain.
[03:27:35.487 --> 03:27:37.268]  Why are there all these proletariats out here?
[03:27:37.268 --> 03:27:39.009]  You know, they've got too high a standard of living.
[03:27:39.009 --> 03:27:41.791]  That's why Obama says you can't have an air-conditioning or a car.
[03:27:41.791 --> 03:27:44.833]  They don't want nice things for themselves.
[03:27:44.833 --> 03:27:46.674]  They want to restrict things to you.
[03:27:46.674 --> 03:27:47.975]  They want control.
[03:27:47.975 --> 03:27:48.916]  They're control freaks.
[03:27:49.756 --> 03:27:56.644]  And so they're trying to get all of the, and there's an extremism to commercialism and stuff, they use that to control people.
[03:27:56.644 --> 03:27:58.526]  They hit it from both angles.
[03:27:58.526 --> 03:28:05.494]  They're destroying it while they build it, but they're trying to basically phase all that out now and have a post-industrial world.
[03:28:05.494 --> 03:28:06.575]  Paul, can you speak to that paradox?
[03:28:08.168 --> 03:28:11.052]  Yeah, well, I mean, you saw it with the Brexit result.
[03:28:11.052 --> 03:28:17.019]  You know, the people in London, the middle classes who are wannabe elitists, they all rally around the elitists.
[03:28:17.019 --> 03:28:24.228]  The elitists have their low-income servants that drag everybody else's wages down, and it's to hell with the rest of the country.
[03:28:24.608 --> 03:28:28.492]  You know, the vast majority of people who voted for Brexit were outside of London.
[03:28:28.492 --> 03:28:31.895]  The people of London, 30-70% voted for it.
[03:28:31.895 --> 03:28:42.224]  So it's this city-centric view where as long as they have this support network of, you know, marginally middle-class people who just want to be part of the establishment, that's why they support it.
[03:28:42.224 --> 03:28:45.828]  And then these low-income basically slaves who do all the work for them.
[03:28:45.828 --> 03:28:48.110]  They're happy with that and it's to hell with everybody else.
[03:28:48.510 --> 03:28:55.076]  In a free market capitalist system, everybody benefits, the whole country benefits, the wealth isn't sucked into a few major cities.
[03:28:55.076 --> 03:28:55.736]  That's right, that's right.
[03:28:55.736 --> 03:29:01.922]  The elites can't handle an open free society based on free will and a free association because they can't create a global dictatorship.
[03:29:01.922 --> 03:29:07.326]  They want a technocracy where they get the life extension technologies and everything for themselves and we don't get any of it.
[03:29:07.326 --> 03:29:11.390]  They're worried about us getting next level technologies that will free everyone.
[03:29:11.790 --> 03:29:15.272]  Okay, because once we get off the planet, their monopoly's over, okay?
[03:29:15.272 --> 03:29:17.273]  So they're literally trying to control the future.
[03:29:17.273 --> 03:29:20.895]  This is a total power grab of the entire species.
[03:29:20.895 --> 03:29:23.076]  Does that make sense?
[03:29:23.076 --> 03:29:29.439]  If you're Kim Jong-un, or if you're in his staff and you live in Pyongyang, then you've got a very high quality of life.
[03:29:29.439 --> 03:29:33.221]  Meanwhile, half a mile away, there are people starving on the streets.
[03:29:33.221 --> 03:29:35.942]  They're perfectly happy for the world to be like that.
[03:29:35.942 --> 03:29:37.403]  Yeah, they do it on purpose!
[03:29:38.283 --> 03:29:42.048]  They don't produce cars because they don't want you to know they even hardly exist.
[03:29:42.048 --> 03:29:43.129]  Thank you, Lonnie.
[03:29:43.129 --> 03:29:46.013]  Stormy, you can get a call from Paul, but I'm handing the baton to Paul Watson.
[03:29:46.013 --> 03:29:46.934]  Support the broadcast.
[03:29:46.934 --> 03:29:47.615]  Spread the word.
[03:29:47.615 --> 03:29:48.877]  The war is now.
[03:29:48.877 --> 03:29:50.679]  Spread the word now!
[03:29:50.679 --> 03:29:53.543]  The revolution against tyranny is now!
[03:29:53.543 --> 03:29:54.544]  Great job, Chris.
[03:30:00.754 --> 03:30:05.818]  The demand for pain-ray weapons grows over fears of civil unrest.
[03:30:05.818 --> 03:30:17.667]  According to a new research study, the market for directed-energy weapons is expected to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period thanks for their use in controlling riots and cross-border trespassing.
[03:30:17.667 --> 03:30:22.230]  The global riot control system market is estimated to grow from $9 billion in 2016 to $11.78 billion by 2021.
[03:30:27.074 --> 03:30:41.037]  As a result of increasing political disputes and civil unrest, militarization of law enforcement agencies, stringent environmental and governmental regulations, and declining defense budgets of developed economies, states the report.
[03:30:41.037 --> 03:30:52.139]  So-called pain rays or active denial systems work by blasting controlled microwaves into a crowd of people, creating an unbearably hot sensation that forces them to flee the scene.
[03:30:52.139 --> 03:30:55.880]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[03:30:59.887 --> 03:31:01.928]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[03:31:01.928 --> 03:31:03.148]  Try a bottle of it.
[03:31:03.148 --> 03:31:04.749]  Rob Dew joins us.
[03:31:04.749 --> 03:31:07.850]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[03:31:07.850 --> 03:31:08.951]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[03:31:08.951 --> 03:31:09.931]  I'd been working all day.
[03:31:09.931 --> 03:31:12.392]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:31:12.392 --> 03:31:13.813]  I get in here at 830.
[03:31:13.813 --> 03:31:15.693]  I was kind of run down.
[03:31:15.693 --> 03:31:17.414]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[03:31:17.634 --> 03:31:19.515]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:31:19.515 --> 03:31:21.356]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[03:31:21.356 --> 03:31:22.417]  I popped two of them.
[03:31:22.417 --> 03:31:24.678]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[03:31:24.678 --> 03:31:26.479]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[03:31:26.479 --> 03:31:28.140]  It's got four and a half stars.
[03:31:28.140 --> 03:31:29.481]  People really love it.
[03:31:29.481 --> 03:31:30.081]  Read about it.
[03:31:30.081 --> 03:31:33.903]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[03:31:33.903 --> 03:31:39.186]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[03:31:39.366 --> 03:31:43.410]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:31:43.410 --> 03:31:49.557]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[03:31:49.557 --> 03:31:55.463]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[03:32:01.395 --> 03:32:02.897]  You can't survive without it.
[03:32:02.897 --> 03:32:04.098]  But where do you get it?
[03:32:04.098 --> 03:32:10.086]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:32:10.086 --> 03:32:15.813]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:32:15.993 --> 03:32:32.857]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[03:33:02.165 --> 03:33:05.511]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:33:05.511 --> 03:33:08.777]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:14.065 --> 03:33:19.309]  We are back on the 4th Hour Live Home Drive of the Alex Jones Show with me, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:19.309 --> 03:33:27.096]  We're gonna get to some other news from Europe in a little while because obviously Alex has covered this Hillary Clinton email scandal.
[03:33:27.096 --> 03:33:28.437]  Fallout!
[03:33:28.437 --> 03:33:37.805]  Basically, many pundits, many commentators are saying that this is the most breathtaking fix in American political history.
[03:33:37.805 --> 03:33:40.888]  You had the FBI Director Comey get up there
[03:33:41.448 --> 03:33:49.435]  Lay out in detail, in a 15-20 minute disquisition, how Hillary Clinton broke the law.
[03:33:49.435 --> 03:33:54.239]  Only to conclude that Hillary Clinton is above the law.
[03:33:54.239 --> 03:33:55.560]  Period.
[03:33:55.560 --> 03:34:01.486]  Final confirmation, as if it were needed, that America is a banana republic.
[03:34:02.714 --> 03:34:06.416]  And the outrage, the reaction, the backlash from this continues.
[03:34:06.416 --> 03:34:08.358]  Here's some of the feedback that we've seen.
[03:34:08.358 --> 03:34:10.639]  Here's Dinesh D'Souza.
[03:34:10.639 --> 03:34:14.502]  If reports are accurate that James Comey won't indict, which of course it turned out they were,
[03:34:15.359 --> 03:34:20.944]  How that'll encourage these Clinton gangsters to continue their crime spree.
[03:34:20.944 --> 03:34:22.145]  And that's the point, isn't it?
[03:34:22.145 --> 03:34:27.149]  This is only going to embolden the Clinton crime family.
[03:34:27.149 --> 03:34:36.997]  We saw the sheer chutzpah, the brazen arrogance of Bill Clinton meeting with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac there at Phoenix Airport.
[03:34:36.997 --> 03:34:39.679]  And again, many commentators said, why did he do that?
[03:34:39.679 --> 03:34:40.880]  Well, because he could.
[03:34:41.661 --> 03:34:47.327]  Because he's a gangster, he's a criminal, and he's not afraid to show it.
[03:34:47.327 --> 03:34:56.918]  Again, meeting with Loretta Lynch, the person responsible for investigating Hillary Clinton, but they just talked about golf and grandchildren, and you can trust them.
[03:34:57.796 --> 03:35:04.763]  Then Hillary Clinton afterwards saying, oh yeah, Loretta Lynch may have a place within my future administration.
[03:35:04.763 --> 03:35:16.454]  Again, the absolute brazen chutzpah of merely suggesting that when she's the person, even though she half recused herself, who is going to have the final say on this indictment.
[03:35:17.196 --> 03:35:21.579]  Now, of course, Comey has come out and taken the fall, whether he was threatened or not.
[03:35:21.579 --> 03:35:23.581]  Some people are speculating he was.
[03:35:23.581 --> 03:35:26.984]  But again, that takes the heat off Loretta Lynch.
[03:35:26.984 --> 03:35:30.006]  Now everybody's expecting it to come to nothing.
[03:35:30.006 --> 03:35:34.810]  She can quietly slip into the Hillary White House, no questions asked.
[03:35:35.581 --> 03:35:37.703]  Absolutely breathtaking.
[03:35:37.703 --> 03:35:39.364]  Here's some more reaction.
[03:35:39.364 --> 03:35:42.847]  Ari Fleischer, former White House Press Secretary.
[03:35:42.847 --> 03:35:47.010]  If Hillary were still Secretary of State, President Obama would have to fire her.
[03:35:47.010 --> 03:35:51.254]  But instead, he travels with her and seeks to promote her.
[03:35:51.254 --> 03:35:53.215]  Disgusting!
[03:35:53.215 --> 03:35:55.017]  So again, the timing.
[03:35:55.017 --> 03:36:02.663]  Obama, immediately after this Comey press conference, is on the campaign trail with Hillary Clinton.
[03:36:02.663 --> 03:36:04.624]  The timing is absolutely perfect.
[03:36:05.390 --> 03:36:08.352]  Here's Jan Brewer, former Arizona governor.
[03:36:08.352 --> 03:36:11.535]  What I got from FBI Director Comey's remarks?
[03:36:11.535 --> 03:36:15.498]  Hillary Clinton's recklessness makes her unfit to be president!
[03:36:16.394 --> 03:36:26.837]  And again, you've had Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail constantly invoke this narrative that Donald Trump is reckless with national security.
[03:36:26.837 --> 03:36:33.059]  After she's mishandling these national security issues on a daily basis with her email.
[03:36:33.059 --> 03:36:35.860]  That point now is completely null and void.
[03:36:37.153 --> 03:36:43.257]  And this is what may play in Trump's favour as we go forward, despite the fact that Hillary's not going to be indicted.
[03:36:43.257 --> 03:36:53.044]  The sheer amount of material that came out of this Comey press conference today, Trump is going to run on that for months and months to come.
[03:36:53.044 --> 03:37:02.771]  Let's go to this Fox News clip on that subject, analysing how this will affect the presidential race with Republican strategist Brad Blakeman.
[03:37:02.771 --> 03:37:03.332]  Here's the clip.
[03:37:09.062 --> 03:37:21.969]  Um, so first of all, I believe that interview was on the phone, obviously, and only five minutes was allowed, which I think, you know, at this point, that is like everything here.
[03:37:21.969 --> 03:37:24.790]  It seems very concocted to protect her.
[03:37:24.790 --> 03:37:30.853]  And boy, would I like her to be doing well right now, but Mark Halperin, tell me what you see in this.
[03:37:30.853 --> 03:37:32.254]  Are they trying to move this along?
[03:37:38.945 --> 03:37:41.427]  Yeah, we need to go to the Fox News clip.
[03:37:41.427 --> 03:37:43.789]  This is Republican strategist Brad Blakeman.
[03:37:43.789 --> 03:37:45.671]  Let me know if you have that clip.
[03:37:45.671 --> 03:37:53.177]  Because he's talking about how this will affect Trump, how Trump will be able to exploit this, how it will change the conversation.
[03:37:53.177 --> 03:37:55.259]  We'll go to that clip soon anyway.
[03:37:55.259 --> 03:38:00.483]  More feedback though, more remarks coming out as a result of this non-indictment of Hillary Clinton.
[03:38:00.483 --> 03:38:04.726]  This is Sean Parnell, co-founder of American Warrior Initiative.
[03:38:05.467 --> 03:38:06.908]  He says it's official.
[03:38:06.908 --> 03:38:08.509]  We're a banana republic.
[03:38:08.509 --> 03:38:13.352]  One where high-ranking officials aren't subject to the law.
[03:38:13.352 --> 03:38:14.673]  Harry Shearer.
[03:38:14.673 --> 03:38:17.034]  Again, by no means a right-wing republican.
[03:38:17.034 --> 03:38:17.855]  He's a left-winger.
[03:38:18.735 --> 03:38:25.018]  He says there's a great recommendation for President, quote, extremely careless.
[03:38:25.018 --> 03:38:35.262]  And again, that's what FBI Director Comey said, that she was, quote, extremely careless with national security material.
[03:38:35.262 --> 03:38:41.705]  In eight cases, top secret classified material, she was, quote, extremely careless.
[03:38:41.705 --> 03:38:45.667]  And yet somehow that doesn't equate to negligence.
[03:38:46.889 --> 03:38:48.350]  We talk about precedent.
[03:38:48.350 --> 03:38:50.131]  I mean, Comey alluded to it.
[03:38:50.131 --> 03:38:59.939]  He said, listen, some people in the past, some people in the future, to paraphrase him, you know, they will face punishment for the exact same thing that Hillary Clinton did.
[03:38:59.939 --> 03:39:02.181]  But Hillary Clinton won't!
[03:39:02.181 --> 03:39:03.882]  What's the only determination?
[03:39:03.882 --> 03:39:06.144]  What's the only conclusion you can draw for that?
[03:39:06.144 --> 03:39:09.446]  Well, it's the fact that Hillary Clinton is above the law.
[03:39:09.446 --> 03:39:10.607]  But we go back to December 1996.
[03:39:12.930 --> 03:39:21.153]  John Deutch resigned from the FBI after it was discovered that he had stored highly classified documents on his home computer, which was connected to the internet.
[03:39:21.153 --> 03:39:28.156]  After a criminal investigation, Deutch agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and pay a $5,000 fine.
[03:39:28.156 --> 03:39:29.256]  But wait for it!
[03:39:29.256 --> 03:39:30.037]  How did he get off?
[03:39:30.950 --> 03:39:38.712]  Before the prosecutors could file the papers in federal court, President Bill Clinton pardoned him on his last day in office.
[03:39:38.712 --> 03:39:46.795]  So again, the exact same scenario, mishandling classified documents on his home computer.
[03:39:46.795 --> 03:39:47.615]  He was guilty.
[03:39:47.615 --> 03:39:51.376]  He had to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and pay a $5,000 fine.
[03:39:51.376 --> 03:39:55.338]  He was pardoned by President Bill Clinton.
[03:39:55.338 --> 03:39:56.218]  David Petraeus.
[03:39:57.386 --> 03:40:00.529]  Again, this is an ABC News report from when this happened.
[03:40:00.529 --> 03:40:10.620]  Petraeus has entered into an agreement with federal prosecutors in which he would plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge for mishandling classified information.
[03:40:10.620 --> 03:40:20.269]  The charge, unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, stems in part from documents the former director allegedly provided to his mistress.
[03:40:21.070 --> 03:40:27.572]  So again, in fact he was up for a higher degree charge before he pled guilty to a misdemeanor.
[03:40:27.572 --> 03:40:35.395]  The fact is that he had to plead guilty because he was mishandling classified information.
[03:40:35.395 --> 03:40:36.516]  Here's another example.
[03:40:37.335 --> 03:40:42.238]  This is on the FBI's own website from less than a year ago.
[03:40:42.238 --> 03:40:44.600]  July 29, 2015.
[03:40:44.600 --> 03:40:52.945]  Folsom Naval Reservist is sentenced after pleading guilty to unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials.
[03:40:52.945 --> 03:40:55.347]  This is Brian H. Nishimura
[03:40:56.206 --> 03:40:56.606]  So here's
[03:41:25.529 --> 03:41:27.450]  Security clearance was completely revoked.
[03:41:27.450 --> 03:41:28.631]  He could never seek it again.
[03:41:28.631 --> 03:41:35.575]  And yet Hillary Clinton, who did exactly the same thing, is going to have the highest security clearance imaginable for that position.
[03:41:36.744 --> 03:41:38.665]  If she becomes president.
[03:41:38.665 --> 03:41:44.810]  Again, this article from the FBI's own website, Sacramento Division, continues.
[03:41:44.810 --> 03:41:52.176]  According to court documents, Nishimura was a naval reservist deployed in Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008.
[03:41:52.176 --> 03:41:54.257]  In his role as a regional engineer for the U.S.
[03:41:54.257 --> 03:42:05.746]  military in Afghanistan, Nishimura had access to classified briefings and digital records that could only be retained and viewed on authorized government computers.
[03:42:06.650 --> 03:42:16.636]  Nishimura, however, caused the materials to be downloaded and stored on his personal, unclassified electronic devices and storage media.
[03:42:16.636 --> 03:42:35.409]  He carried such classified materials on his unauthorized media when he traveled off base in Afghanistan, and ultimately carried those materials back to the United States at the end of his deployment, just as Hillary Clinton was sending those emails when she was in Russia and China.
[03:42:36.249 --> 03:42:48.557]  So you see, again, in this case it was not a deliberate intent, you know, to give out classified materials to hostile powers, to foreign powers or hostile agents.
[03:42:48.557 --> 03:42:51.900]  It was merely the fact that he mishandled the classified information.
[03:42:51.900 --> 03:42:54.561]  He was sentenced.
[03:42:54.561 --> 03:42:58.484]  $7,500 fine, two years of probation.
[03:42:58.484 --> 03:43:04.328]  The exact same scenario, but his last name was not Clinton.
[03:43:05.987 --> 03:43:10.830]  And that's the standard right now for being above the law.
[03:43:10.830 --> 03:43:13.132]  Now let's get into the law a little bit more.
[03:43:13.132 --> 03:43:15.934]  In fact, I think we've got that clip now.
[03:43:15.934 --> 03:43:26.721]  Again, this is Republican strategist Brad Blakeman on Fox News talking about how this fallout will affect the presidential election.
[03:43:26.721 --> 03:43:27.382]  Here's that clip.
[03:43:28.567 --> 03:43:32.990]  Quotes, Brad, from the FBI Director's statements.
[03:43:32.990 --> 03:43:39.756]  There is evidence they, meaning Hillary and her staff, were extremely careless in their handling of classified info.
[03:43:39.756 --> 03:43:49.223]  There is evidence that any reasonable person in Clinton's position should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that information.
[03:43:49.223 --> 03:43:54.467]  Pretty damning words for the person who wants to be the next President of the United States.
[03:43:55.140 --> 03:43:56.521]  There's no doubt about it.
[03:43:56.521 --> 03:44:00.642]  This may be a victory for Hillary Clinton, but it's a defeat for American justice.
[03:44:00.642 --> 03:44:07.445]  One thing is for sure, John, while Hillary may never be tried in a court of law, she is going to be tried in the court of public opinion.
[03:44:07.445 --> 03:44:10.106]  And it's going to be up to Donald Trump to be the prosecutor.
[03:44:10.106 --> 03:44:11.947]  The American people are going to be the jury.
[03:44:11.947 --> 03:44:14.868]  The electorate is going to determine whether or not Hillary Clinton
[03:44:15.448 --> 03:44:23.999]  ...is capable of being the President of the United States in view of her recklessness with regard to the handling and dissemination of the most sensitive American secrets.
[03:44:23.999 --> 03:44:26.402]  Anybody else but Hillary Clinton would have been indicted.
[03:44:26.402 --> 03:44:27.984]  There's no question about it.
[03:44:27.984 --> 03:44:30.548]  Because she's Hillary Clinton, she got a pass.
[03:44:30.548 --> 03:44:32.871]  The question is, will the American people give her one too?
[03:44:34.204 --> 03:44:35.405]  And that's the point, isn't it?
[03:44:35.405 --> 03:44:39.047]  You know, will this beef the crooked Hillary meme even more?
[03:44:39.047 --> 03:44:47.693]  In a year, 2016, which has seen a complete revolt against the status quo, especially after the Brexit vote.
[03:44:47.693 --> 03:44:50.755]  Can Trump play on those concerns?
[03:44:50.755 --> 03:44:52.256]  Will this beef the view?
[03:44:52.256 --> 03:45:02.904]  Will this beef the narrative that things are completely out of control, that Hillary Clinton is above the law, that she represents this establishment that's so hated?
[03:45:03.783 --> 03:45:15.914]  You know, she's trying to back away from that image now by, you know, saying she won't support TPP and things like this because she knows that that is toxic to be associated with this discredited establishment.
[03:45:15.914 --> 03:45:21.059]  So this could backfire on Hillary despite the fact that it's a victory right now.
[03:45:21.059 --> 03:45:27.945]  Trump is going to get a lot of gas mileage out of this scandal because again, he's going to make the point
[03:45:28.803 --> 03:45:37.072]  That crooked Hillary was protected by an administration, by a federal government that has placed her above the law.
[03:45:37.072 --> 03:45:40.815]  This is Guy Benson, town hall political editor.
[03:45:40.815 --> 03:45:48.784]  She mishandled top secret classified material in an extremely careless manner, which is not grossly negligent, apparently.
[03:45:50.086 --> 03:45:54.087]  Again, as I said, they laid out the fact that it was extremely careless.
[03:45:54.087 --> 03:46:00.749]  She broke the law, and we're going to go through the law in a second, but somehow that doesn't equate to gross negligence.
[03:46:00.749 --> 03:46:06.490]  Brazenly telling the American people that Hillary Clinton is above the law.
[03:46:06.490 --> 03:46:09.391]  Now, there's a Ben Shapiro article on Daily Wire.
[03:46:09.391 --> 03:46:12.692]  It's FBI, yes, Queen Hillary broke the law.
[03:46:12.692 --> 03:46:15.053]  No, she won't be prosecuted.
[03:46:15.053 --> 03:46:19.014]  And this really drills down, gets into the specific laws that have been broken.
[03:46:20.273 --> 03:46:28.437]  On July 4th, 1776, the United States announced its independence from Great Britain based on the key principle of rule of law.
[03:46:28.437 --> 03:46:34.560]  On July 5th, 2016, the United States said, F it, I'm with Hillary!
[03:46:35.458 --> 03:47:02.446]  Just days after the Attorney General of the United States, Loretta Lynch, held a secret meeting aboard a plane with former President Bill Clinton, whose wife was under an FBI investigation, just the day after Hillary leaked that she'd want Lynch for her own administration, just hours after the President of the United States, Barack Obama, flew Hillary, still under FBI investigation, down to North Carolina on Air Force One, in just two hours,
[03:47:03.126 --> 03:47:19.377]  Before Obama was to open his campaign on behalf of Hillary Clinton, FBI Director James Comey announced that while Hillary Clinton had clearly engaged in criminal activity worthy of prosecution, he had recommended that she not be prosecuted.
[03:47:19.377 --> 03:47:21.538]  Because of course he did!
[03:47:21.538 --> 03:47:27.442]  Here are Comey's findings which demonstrate full violation of multiple provisions of federal law.
[03:47:27.442 --> 03:47:30.024]  And you can go through this article and read them for yourself.
[03:47:31.454 --> 03:47:33.175]  So Hillary lied.
[03:47:33.175 --> 03:47:36.257]  She lied that she never transmitted classified information.
[03:47:36.257 --> 03:47:40.380]  She lied that she only used a private server because she wanted one device.
[03:47:40.380 --> 03:47:45.503]  She lied that the State Department allowed her to jerry-rig this technological setup.
[03:47:45.503 --> 03:47:49.085]  She lied that the emails were never breached.
[03:47:49.085 --> 03:47:52.828]  But according to Comey, no biggie!
[03:47:52.828 --> 03:47:57.611]  Now Comey essentially admitted that Hillary violated federal law, and here's his quote.
[03:47:58.556 --> 03:48:24.044]  Our investigation looked at whether there is evidence classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on that personal system, in violation of a federal statute making it a felony to mishandle classified information either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way, or a second statute making it a misdemeanor to knowingly remove classified information from appropriate systems or storage facilities.
[03:48:24.952 --> 03:48:37.803]  And Comey stated that the FBI had, quote, investigated to determine whether there is evidence of computer intrusion in connection with a personal email server by any foreign power or other hostile actors.
[03:48:37.803 --> 03:48:50.553]  Now remember, Guccifer, the Romanian hacker, said, went on record, he's now in a prison, that he personally hacked into Hillary Clinton's email server.
[03:48:50.553 --> 03:48:53.195]  But of course, Comey said that because there was no trace,
[03:48:54.090 --> 03:48:57.313]  That they couldn't go after her on that basis.
[03:48:57.313 --> 03:49:02.698]  Of course, you're not going to leave a trace via the method that he said he did it.
[03:49:02.698 --> 03:49:10.385]  How he did it on previous occasions, hacked into other people's emails accounts, he simply guessed the password.
[03:49:10.385 --> 03:49:14.329]  So there was no actual hostile attempt to hack into the server.
[03:49:14.329 --> 03:49:17.351]  There was no trace left because he merely guessed the password.
[03:49:18.154 --> 03:49:24.010]  He publicly said he did the same, went through the same process with Hillary Clinton's private email server.
[03:49:24.010 --> 03:49:26.536]  But again, Comey didn't even mention that.
[03:49:27.912 --> 03:49:29.993]  The article continues, but no matter.
[03:49:29.993 --> 03:49:40.439]  The law doesn't apply to Hillary Clinton, as Comey said, quote, To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences.
[03:49:40.439 --> 03:49:47.944]  To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions, but that is not what we're deciding now.
[03:49:47.944 --> 03:49:51.566]  And as I laid out with the three previous examples, and there are many more,
[03:49:53.134 --> 03:49:59.497]  They not only faced administrative actions, they faced in one case two years probation.
[03:49:59.497 --> 03:50:03.379]  Again, the soldier out of Afghanistan who I talked about, Nishimura.
[03:50:03.379 --> 03:50:15.064]  Again, mishandling classified information, downloading it onto his own personal device, transporting it around exactly as Hillary Clinton did.
[03:50:15.064 --> 03:50:16.705]  He was hit with a $7,500 fine and two years probation.
[03:50:20.236 --> 03:50:22.960]  David Petraeus, similar circumstances.
[03:50:22.960 --> 03:50:26.044]  Deutch, the former FBI director, similar circumstances.
[03:50:26.044 --> 03:50:27.906]  He got a pardon from Clinton.
[03:50:27.906 --> 03:50:29.408]  But again, they were punished!
[03:50:30.652 --> 03:50:42.240]  So Comey's right when he says, you know, other people under similar circumstances were punished in the past, in the past and will be in the future, but not Hillary Clinton.
[03:50:42.240 --> 03:50:52.647]  What else are we to conclude from that other than the fact that Hillary Clinton is above the law and the United States is a banana republic?
[03:50:52.647 --> 03:50:58.290]  We'll be back with the final segment of the Alex Jones Show Live, covering news from Europe after the break.
[03:50:58.290 --> 03:50:59.932]  Breaking news at Infowars.com.
[03:50:59.932 --> 03:51:00.432]  Don't go away.
[03:51:00.852 --> 03:51:02.834]  My name is Don Whiskin.
[03:51:02.834 --> 03:51:07.797]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:07.797 --> 03:51:11.820]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:51:11.820 --> 03:51:13.381]  He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:13.381 --> 03:51:17.284]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:51:17.284 --> 03:51:22.047]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:51:22.047 --> 03:51:22.888]  He waited too long.
[03:51:23.308 --> 03:51:26.671]  In June, that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:51:26.671 --> 03:51:27.551]  What did I do?
[03:51:27.551 --> 03:51:35.017]  I took a 7-herb formula I now call ExtendoVite, made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle, and valerian.
[03:51:35.017 --> 03:51:43.444]  Based on German studies of natural medicine, ExtendoVite is designed to clear blocked arteries, clean the toxins from your blood, and improve your immune system.
[03:51:43.444 --> 03:51:44.965]  To get your ExtendoVite, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:44.965 --> 03:51:45.385]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:45.385 --> 03:51:45.945]  Or visit our website,
[03:51:53.251 --> 03:51:54.072]  HeartDrop.com.
[03:51:59.915 --> 03:52:01.755]  This is Michael David from Seattle.
[03:52:01.755 --> 03:52:07.617]  I'm 51 years old, and six months ago, I started taking Andro 400 to increase my testosterone.
[03:52:07.617 --> 03:52:13.138]  Since then, I've lost 35 pounds of fat, and my waist went from size 38 to size 32.
[03:52:13.138 --> 03:52:16.499]  I have more energy, and I look and feel 20 years younger.
[03:52:16.499 --> 03:52:19.420]  And now, my wife tells me I have to take Andro 400.
[03:52:19.420 --> 03:52:22.080]  Hi, this is Ron Johnson from Utah.
[03:52:22.080 --> 03:52:26.381]  After 10 weeks of taking Andro 400, I lost 13 pounds, and my waist went from 36 to 33.
[03:52:26.381 --> 03:52:27.022]  That was 8 years ago.
[03:52:29.182 --> 03:52:33.665]  I continue to take Andro400 and I've maintained my weight at 172.
[03:52:33.665 --> 03:52:35.146]  Gained muscle and energy.
[03:52:35.146 --> 03:52:38.648]  I'm 63 now and feel better than I have in 30 years.
[03:52:38.648 --> 03:52:39.949]  Andro400.
[03:52:39.949 --> 03:52:45.413]  The natural way to increase testosterone, lose belly fat, gain energy and feel great.
[03:52:45.413 --> 03:52:46.874]  Try Andro400.
[03:52:46.874 --> 03:52:50.556]  The safe, effective, affordable way to boost your testosterone.
[03:52:50.556 --> 03:52:51.917]  Go to andro400.com or call 888-400-0435.

[03:53:57.828 --> 03:53:58.569]  Effective.
[03:54:13.100 --> 03:54:13.480]  We're back.
[03:54:13.480 --> 03:54:18.104]  It's the final segment of the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday edition.
[03:54:18.104 --> 03:54:27.332]  Now, ISIS members are once again bragging about how they can exploit Europe's borders, which are basically like SIBs right now.
[03:54:27.332 --> 03:54:29.374]  This is out of politico.eu.
[03:54:29.374 --> 03:54:32.617]  Man in the Hat claims terror cells in Paris and Brussels, part of a larger network.
[03:54:33.743 --> 03:54:40.130]  And one of the ISIS terrorists they quote in the article said that the terror cell moved freely through Europe.
[03:54:40.130 --> 03:54:46.257]  He said quote, you know an international arrest warrant to be sought by the police that doesn't change anything.
[03:54:46.257 --> 03:54:51.683]  I passed every day in front of soldiers, policemen, not with a covered face, but with a cap.
[03:54:52.344 --> 03:54:55.727]  He added, quote, security at the borders can never protect anyone.
[03:54:55.727 --> 03:55:01.811]  It's just the politicians who want to delude people that they protect them, but there is usually no security.
[03:55:01.811 --> 03:55:04.413]  It has never been real.
[03:55:04.413 --> 03:55:10.958]  Again, that is why ISIS in their own manifesto brags about how they exploited the refugee program
[03:55:11.658 --> 03:55:14.880]  To infiltrate jihadists into Europe.
[03:55:14.880 --> 03:55:23.646]  We saw another example of that with the Istanbul airport attack where the mastermind was a refugee protected by the EU.
[03:55:23.646 --> 03:55:28.189]  He was being arrested with Kalashnikovs and explosives in his car in Sweden.
[03:55:28.189 --> 03:55:32.813]  They put him in jail for a year because Sweden's a liberal basket case hellhole.
[03:55:33.453 --> 03:55:44.456]  Russia tried to extradite this guy on two separate occasions to charge him with terrorism and the EU protected him because he was a precious refugee.
[03:55:44.456 --> 03:55:51.457]  Later becoming the mastermind of the bloody Istanbul airport attack.
[03:55:51.457 --> 03:55:52.678]  They're laughing at us.
[03:55:52.678 --> 03:55:57.979]  Every single day they're laughing at us because we just invite them right on in.
[03:55:59.195 --> 03:56:05.861]  Now with regard to the Brexit, this is out Sky News, Branson and May meet as Tycoon demands new poll.
[03:56:05.861 --> 03:56:22.997]  So basically the favourite to become the next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom after the resignation of David Cameron is having secret meetings with Richard Branson who is openly calling for democracy to be subverted and for there to be a second referendum on Brexit.
[03:56:23.718 --> 03:56:40.999]  So this supposedly conservative next Prime Minister, who isn't conservative at all, she's a globalist, she's the one who said that Sharia law was good for women in the United Kingdom, secretly meeting with a billionaire who wants to subvert democracy.
[03:56:40.999 --> 03:56:43.022]  Here's another article from Infowars.com.
[03:56:44.332 --> 03:56:48.453]  Dom zombie Americans think the US is 2016 years old.
[03:56:48.453 --> 03:56:58.557]  Yes, they actually thought that Independence Day, celebrating the birthday of America, meant that America was 2016 years old, because it's the year 2016.
[03:56:58.557 --> 03:57:04.039]  Never underestimate the stupidity of the general public.
[03:57:04.824 --> 03:57:06.805]  And again, you saw it with the new Mark Dice video.
[03:57:06.805 --> 03:57:09.345]  They don't know how many stars are on the American flag.
[03:57:09.345 --> 03:57:23.190]  They don't know anything about US history because now, as a separate report notes, only 23 undergraduate history programs at 76 top universities require any type of US history course.
[03:57:23.190 --> 03:57:31.473]  But of course, many of them now require gender studies and all kinds of feminist, identity politics, social justice warrior crap.
[03:57:32.313 --> 03:57:36.782]  So that's why the general public continues to be completely misinformed.
[03:57:38.348 --> 03:57:45.552]  German police report confirmed surge in child rapes by migrants in swimming pools and admits we have grave cause for concern.
[03:57:45.552 --> 03:57:50.955]  Yes, this is the racist German government once again with their racist statistics.
[03:57:50.955 --> 03:57:57.699]  Here's a quote from the article talking about children being sexually abused at swimming pools by migrants.
[03:57:57.699 --> 03:58:01.681]  Quote, the perpetrators are, for the most part, immigrants.
[03:58:02.532 --> 03:58:09.435]  That's the German government saying that it's not Pegida, it's not radical right-wing racists.
[03:58:09.435 --> 03:58:12.717]  So what are you going to do when the facts continue to show this?
[03:58:12.717 --> 03:58:26.623]  Well, just denounce the facts as racist and again continue to import millions and millions of people who are completely incompatible with Western society and destroy the fabric of Western civilization.
[03:58:27.449 --> 03:58:30.312]  That's going to wrap it up for today's edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:30.312 --> 03:58:32.014]  InfoWars Nightly News coming up.
[03:58:32.014 --> 03:58:33.795]  Alex will be back, 11 to 2 tomorrow.
[03:58:33.795 --> 03:58:38.900]  Look out for that big Facebook rigging the election article on InfoWars.com.
