[00:00:00.276 --> 00:00:05.702]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:05.702 --> 00:00:10.467]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:22.259]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ted Cruz is escalating his propaganda war as he steals the election with the RNC as he steals the Republican nomination or attempts to a new level.
[00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:38.672]  I have a clip coming up where Cruz says he's winning every single election and is ahead and that Trump is a sore loser even though he has hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of more delegates than him.
[00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:42.115]  And that this is democracy that Trump is fighting.
[00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:51.263]  But they never mention, by the way, we just got all the superdelegates that announced in Colorado and other states they're ignoring what the actual delegates
[00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:54.535]  Said that they were representing.
[00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:57.720]  But that's a cart before the horse in Colorado.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.123]  Because they never even had the primary.
[00:01:02.602 --> 00:01:04.683]  But then the delegates say, actually, we want Trump.
[00:01:04.683 --> 00:01:05.823]  And they go, no, no, no.
[00:01:05.823 --> 00:01:11.444]  The superdelegates that we just pulled out of the hat, they now vote for Cruz.
[00:01:11.444 --> 00:01:14.345]  And then Matt Drudge comes out and says, you know, this looks pretty bad.
[00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:15.146]  He didn't even say that.
[00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:18.366]  He links to the headlines, you know, no voters needed.
[00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:23.728]  And the conniption fit begins with Cruz calling Trump a Lacosa Nostra Sicilian mobster.
[00:01:27.073 --> 00:01:35.135]  Well, I mean, Trump's not even Italian, but why are you dragging Italians into this or Sicilians into this?
[00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:36.215]  It's just bizarre.
[00:01:36.215 --> 00:01:43.457]  I mean, it's kind of like saying Trump's in the Mexican mafia.
[00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:44.577]  I don't know what it means.
[00:01:44.577 --> 00:01:48.078]  It's just, it's just, or Trump's in the crypts and the bloods.
[00:01:48.078 --> 00:01:52.699]  It's just, it's just some gutter level deal that he thinks appeals to people.
[00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:56.220]  Like when he said, we don't like you New Yorkers down here in the South.
[00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:59.904]  That'd be kind of a shameful statement if it was a Southerner.
[00:01:59.904 --> 00:02:01.425]  Or a real Texan.
[00:02:01.425 --> 00:02:04.248]  But he's from Canada.
[00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:12.676]  And I'm just really tired of folks from other countries going, Yeah boy, got my cowboy hat, got my snakeskin boots.
[00:02:12.676 --> 00:02:19.383]  I tell you one thing right now, there's one thing I like to do with my lariat.
[00:02:19.383 --> 00:02:20.925]  Go out there and rope me a steer.
[00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:26.124]  Cook it up for dinner out there at the Chuckwagon.
[00:02:26.124 --> 00:02:31.487]  How long's it been since you had a big ol' steamin' bowl?
[00:02:31.487 --> 00:02:35.210]  Ted Cruz BS.
[00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.611]  Well, that's too long, isn't it?
[00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:44.496]  So, we're going to come back with the main launch of the transmission today, and it is going to be amazing.
[00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:47.278]  It's exclusive at the New York Times, exclusive at
[00:02:51.135 --> 00:02:57.139]  Politico, everywhere has the big headline, Roger Stone, Trump Delegate Should Sign a Loyalty Pledge.
[00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.941]  He broke that here yesterday.
[00:02:59.941 --> 00:03:04.303]  I mean, I'm not bragging that we just keep having the exclusives with Roger Stone.
[00:03:04.303 --> 00:03:09.487]  I just love how the media is calling an exclusive.
[00:03:09.487 --> 00:03:17.652]  Here is the actual video, full 45-minute interview, 46-minute interview, up on Infowars.com.
[00:03:17.652 --> 00:03:18.853]  It's got a headline that would
[00:03:20.396 --> 00:03:21.756]  Think a submarine, though.
[00:03:21.756 --> 00:03:24.177]  Tricky Ted Cruz lies more than Nixon.
[00:03:24.177 --> 00:03:25.497]  Roger Stone.
[00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:33.079]  You know, that's kind of an interesting headline on the interview, but the interview really is about the future of the Trump campaign, the attempts to steal the election.
[00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:44.142]  And the headline, my fault, I should be coming up with these headlines, because I just get shell-shocked by the end of the show, and there's all this breaking news here, and I don't really realize how important it is, or go tell folks the headlines, or go have somebody write an article about it.
[00:03:44.142 --> 00:03:48.063]  But it's okay, because then everybody else does, so at least the news gets out, and that's what's important.
[00:03:50.205 --> 00:03:55.026]  It reminds us what we all do as citizens, as voters, as mothers, as fathers, as humans.
[00:03:55.026 --> 00:04:02.008]  We get so close to tyranny, fighting it, that we almost become comfortable with it, even when we're having victories.
[00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:08.629]  We're having sensational victories against the tyrants, but we don't really stop and then celebrate those victories.
[00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.730]  Congress has a 9% approval rating.
[00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.810]  Yay!
[00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.651]  They're illegitimate, run by foreign interests.
[00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:17.132]  People know the Federal Reserve's private now, on average.
[00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:18.712]  They know there's a global government being formed.
[00:04:19.773 --> 00:04:21.599]  They know they're sealing the election.
[00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.104]  We're forcing a fight!
[00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:31.577]  They wanted to just say there's no Agenda 21, there's no global government, there's no banker bailouts, there's no credit default swaps.
[00:04:31.577 --> 00:04:35.878]  I would talk about derivatives with banking experts 19 years ago.
[00:04:35.878 --> 00:04:38.579]  I didn't learn about it until the first few years I was on air.
[00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:41.300]  A couple years on air, I started learning about it and I would have these banking experts on.
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.520]  Incredible stuff.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.301]  Lawyers, you name it.
[00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:48.242]  People would write articles saying I was making it up.
[00:04:48.242 --> 00:04:50.683]  Well now we know credit default swaps were real.
[00:04:51.343 --> 00:04:54.888]  It's all rigged, and we're just having that wake-up process.
[00:04:54.888 --> 00:04:57.191]  The world's waking up together right now.
[00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:00.892]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:05:00.892 --> 00:05:04.313]  Textilizer wants to be a breathalyzer for your cell phone.
[00:05:04.313 --> 00:05:06.134]  Article up by Gizmodo.
[00:05:06.134 --> 00:05:09.595]  Distracted driving is a hazard up there with drinking and driving.
[00:05:09.595 --> 00:05:16.218]  A solution proposed in a draft New York legislation would solve that using a roadside phone analyzer.
[00:05:16.218 --> 00:05:24.001]  The bill provides for the field testing for use of mobile telephones and portable electronic devices while driving after an accident or collision.
[00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:32.083]  After being involved in an accident, a driver would have to submit their phone for roadside testing or face an automatic suspension of their license.
[00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:36.824]  That testing would be done anonymously using a device that would only look at metadata.
[00:05:36.824 --> 00:05:37.444]  Hmm.
[00:05:37.444 --> 00:05:38.104]  Yeah.
[00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:38.744]  Sure, buddy.
[00:05:38.744 --> 00:05:42.145]  The actual content of a message, picture, or game would not be revealed.
[00:05:42.145 --> 00:05:43.645]  Yeah, I don't believe that one.
[00:05:43.645 --> 00:05:46.746]  Seeing as how the NSA and others are putting their fingers at everything.
[00:05:46.966 --> 00:05:56.070]  A driver under suspicion of distracted driving will be under extreme pressure to unlock their phone to prove their innocence, giving officers full access to everything on a handset.
[00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.751]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:58.751 --> 00:05:59.712]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[00:05:59.712 --> 00:06:00.272]  Good, brother.
[00:06:00.272 --> 00:06:01.993]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:06:01.993 --> 00:06:03.954]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:06:03.954 --> 00:06:07.976]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:06:07.976 --> 00:06:10.597]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:06:10.597 --> 00:06:13.018]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:06:13.018 --> 00:06:15.059]  Super Mill Vitality was developed.
[00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:21.062]  To activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:06:21.062 --> 00:06:24.424]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:06:24.424 --> 00:06:25.964]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:06:25.964 --> 00:06:29.006]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:06:29.006 --> 00:06:30.647]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:06:30.647 --> 00:06:33.088]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[00:06:33.388 --> 00:06:38.511]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:50.498]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience where stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:06:50.498 --> 00:06:57.442]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.

[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.223]  We are on the march.
[00:08:04.223 --> 00:08:05.504]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:08:05.504 --> 00:08:08.226]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:08.226 --> 00:08:11.309]  If you like to gamble, I'll tell you how to play.
[00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:19.675]  You win some, you lose some, and you'll listen to me.
[00:08:20.976 --> 00:08:21.576]  Can you believe it?
[00:08:21.576 --> 00:08:24.257]  It's Wednesday, the 13th day of April, 2016.
[00:08:24.257 --> 00:08:37.342]  Coming up in a couple days, you get those checkbooks out and you write those checks to the Federal Reserve, care of the Internal Revenue Service.
[00:08:37.342 --> 00:08:46.285]  Established in 1913 in the dead of night, December 23rd, by three senators.
[00:08:46.285 --> 00:08:47.385]  Gotta love it, don't you?
[00:08:51.796 --> 00:08:53.918]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:08:53.918 --> 00:08:54.658]  to 3 p.m.
[00:08:54.658 --> 00:08:55.959]  Central.
[00:08:55.959 --> 00:08:56.539]  12 noon to 4 p.m.
[00:08:56.539 --> 00:08:57.340]  Eastern.
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:03.124]  Thank you so much for joining us as we broadcast coast-to-coast, border-to-border, and worldwide.
[00:09:03.124 --> 00:09:08.227]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:09:08.227 --> 00:09:11.469]  And in our fight against the globalists, it's time to double up or quit.
[00:09:11.469 --> 00:09:12.730]  We are having major victories.
[00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:13.811]  We are exposing them.
[00:09:13.811 --> 00:09:17.634]  We are making them reveal themselves as the larcenous
[00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:21.787]  Vicious tyrants they are.
[00:09:21.787 --> 00:09:26.391]  A lot of positive things are happening right now.
[00:09:26.391 --> 00:09:36.281]  Stuart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers, former member of Ron Paul's operation, good friend of mine, Patriot, will be joining us to talk about a new film
[00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:49.982]  That is going to be premiering in Texas, and it's important that when it premieres in theaters, that it sell out, because then other theaters around the country will pick it up, and it could really be an effective situation.
[00:09:49.982 --> 00:09:57.829]  Kamal Saleem will also be joining us, and Chuck Undersea, the maker of the film, David Knight, will be hosting the fourth hour.
[00:09:57.829 --> 00:10:03.014]  And guess who's in the film, Revelation, Dawn of Global Government?
[00:10:04.502 --> 00:10:10.366]  General Boykin, former head of Special Forces, founder of Delta Force, you name it.
[00:10:10.366 --> 00:10:15.949]  We've got Stuart Rhodes, Kamal Saleem, Chuck Undersea obviously directed it.
[00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:17.470]  Yours truly, Alex Jones.
[00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.092]  I'm kind of almost like the narrator of it.
[00:10:20.092 --> 00:10:25.055]  And then we've also got, well, everybody else.
[00:10:25.055 --> 00:10:27.837]  We've got the Motor City madman, Ted Nugent.
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:30.880]  Ron Paul.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.763]  Ron Paul went and watched a private screening of it this last weekend.
[00:10:34.763 --> 00:10:36.565]  In fact, Chuck Andersey sent me some amazing photos.
[00:10:36.565 --> 00:10:40.087]  I want to give you guys so we can tweet them and Facebook them out.
[00:10:40.087 --> 00:10:41.689]  I have no position in this film.
[00:10:41.689 --> 00:10:42.870]  That is, I don't own the film.
[00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.070]  I'm not invested in it.
[00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:55.299]  When it comes out on Blu-ray and DVD, we will sell it at Infowarsstore.com, but Chuck Andersey used to be a TV producer and make big national TV commercials.
[00:10:55.299 --> 00:10:57.541]  He's also a retired Army colonel.
[00:10:58.837 --> 00:11:03.480]  He's a patriot, a Texan, and he's put everything he's got into this film.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:03.821]  Everything.
[00:11:03.821 --> 00:11:06.243]  He spent three years making it, or longer.
[00:11:06.243 --> 00:11:11.707]  And so that's why I'm promoting it, because it's really designed to wake up somebody who's not aware of what's going on.
[00:11:11.707 --> 00:11:14.228]  And it's got a lot of amazing sequences shot in, it's got...
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.182]  A reenactor of George Washington, who looks just like George Washington, is just as tall as George Washington.
[00:11:20.182 --> 00:11:21.923]  We've had him in studio before.
[00:11:21.923 --> 00:11:26.805]  So that is coming up in the second and third hour today.
[00:11:26.805 --> 00:11:31.186]  But we're not just going to talk about the film or play some first ever excerpts here, sneak peeks.
[00:11:31.186 --> 00:11:41.551]  We are also going to be tying it into what's currently happening and affecting the future battle space as the globalists attempt to take over our constitutional republic completely.
[00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:47.832]  Now, let me go ahead and break down some of the news that is coming up, obviously.
[00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:54.217]  I want to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour to get your view on the big election steal.
[00:11:54.217 --> 00:12:06.847]  There is powerful video up on DrugsReport.com of the Colorado Election Day revealed, where it shows the unanimous vote for Ted Cruz by the appointed
[00:12:08.027 --> 00:12:12.109]  Superdelegates ignoring the real delegates who didn't even get to represent voters.
[00:12:12.109 --> 00:12:14.510]  So it's frauds within frauds within frauds.
[00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.412]  Delegates were decided 10 seconds at a time.
[00:12:18.412 --> 00:12:20.633]  Trump calls process a disgrace.
[00:12:20.633 --> 00:12:27.736]  Cruz email asked for $35 to be top deputy delegate.
[00:12:27.736 --> 00:12:31.837]  That's right, Cruz is now offering not to pay off delegates, but
[00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:35.813]  Offering to be part of his operation as a voter.
[00:12:35.813 --> 00:12:41.558]  If you're one of his minions, he will bring you in and then claim that you are a real delegate.
[00:12:41.558 --> 00:12:45.061]  So I guess they want actors, basically, to play the part of delegates.
[00:12:45.061 --> 00:12:48.224]  That's what he's recruiting, is an army of people to say, here are my delegates.
[00:12:48.224 --> 00:12:53.649]  But you have to pay to be one of his gang members, I guess.
[00:12:53.649 --> 00:12:56.071]  So, people are really flipping out.
[00:12:57.978 --> 00:13:01.861]  Here's some of the stories up on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:01.861 --> 00:13:08.406]  2016, the year the Americans found out our elections are rigged.
[00:13:08.406 --> 00:13:10.508]  Ah, the illusion of choice.
[00:13:10.508 --> 00:13:13.450]  The scales coming off the eyes.
[00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:19.114]  Big story that we broke here yesterday, now in Breitbart, New York Times, Politico, you name it.
[00:13:19.114 --> 00:13:22.757]  See the full video interview with Roger Stone at the bottom of the article.
[00:13:22.757 --> 00:13:27.000]  Roger Stone, Trump delegates should sign a loyalty pledge.
[00:13:28.001 --> 00:13:29.823]  Very, very powerful article.
[00:13:29.823 --> 00:13:32.005]  One of the most powerful he's written in a long time.
[00:13:32.005 --> 00:13:36.489]  And again, it's an article written around the exclusive interview where he first broke it here.
[00:13:36.489 --> 00:13:39.251]  Just pointing out, you normally, a lot of times, hear stuff here first.
[00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:40.652]  We're very proud of that fact.
[00:13:40.652 --> 00:13:51.942]  To not just be analyzing news or going out and doing original investigations, but also breaking a lot of exclusive information with newsmakers like Roger Stone on a daily basis.
[00:13:51.942 --> 00:13:53.483]  Huge developments with Dr. Corsi.
[00:13:54.662 --> 00:14:05.707]  Yesterday, of his investigation into the Cruz campaign, actually running the takeover of Eagle Forum and mugging a 92-year-old woman, Phyllis Schlafly.
[00:14:05.707 --> 00:14:09.288]  We have an article going up on InfoWars.com about that interview as well.
[00:14:09.288 --> 00:14:12.369]  Phyllis Schlafly, my board plotted to fire me over Trump.
[00:14:12.369 --> 00:14:14.470]  We have that interview with him as well.
[00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:15.591]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:14:17.506 --> 00:14:39.538]  Before I get into all the latest election news, the theft of the election, the cancelling of the voters in primaries in many states now, before we get to this slow motion destruction of our electoral process, let's look at the background of what's happening.
[00:14:39.538 --> 00:14:41.099]  Turmoil all over the world.
[00:14:41.099 --> 00:14:45.302]  Presidents, prime ministers, chancellors being appointed to office.
[00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:57.636]  Wars, economic meltdown in China, the World Bank coming out, the IMF saying they're going to go to zero interest rates.
[00:14:57.636 --> 00:15:04.301]  This is all part and parcel of the mega-colossal bubble we're all sitting on top of.
[00:15:04.301 --> 00:15:10.925]  And there's a good chance Donald Trump may not get assassinated, may actually be able to defeat the cheaters, because of popular will.
[00:15:12.472 --> 00:15:16.535]  I'll give him about a 30% chance of not getting killed or actually getting in office, one or the other.
[00:15:16.535 --> 00:15:18.736]  That's 30% chance.
[00:15:18.736 --> 00:15:21.398]  And I'm not putting negative odds out there to scare people.
[00:15:21.398 --> 00:15:24.620]  Donald Trump is a hero because of his courage.
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:29.504]  I disagree with some of the things he says, but he's on a suicide mission.
[00:15:29.504 --> 00:15:31.285]  That's the headline of this segment.
[00:15:31.285 --> 00:15:32.726]  Donald Trump's on a suicide mission.
[00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:37.891]  A suicide mission doesn't mean you're going to die every time, but it means there's a good chance.
[00:15:37.891 --> 00:15:40.073]  50-50 or 30-70.
[00:15:40.073 --> 00:15:44.676]  I mean, it means we're talking Russian roulette here.
[00:15:44.676 --> 00:15:46.797]  And you've got to admire a man in the arena like that.
[00:15:46.797 --> 00:15:48.398]  Because I'm a man in the arena.
[00:15:48.398 --> 00:15:51.360]  Not as much as Trump is, but I'm pretty close.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.101]  And so is Roger Scott and others.
[00:15:53.101 --> 00:15:55.282]  And it's an exclusive club.
[00:15:55.282 --> 00:16:00.986]  Matt Drudge is in there, deeper than I am, in the arena.
[00:16:00.986 --> 00:16:02.607]  And I see a lot of other people buckling.
[00:16:05.472 --> 00:16:10.675]  To it, at major news sites, and I see other news sites split.
[00:16:10.675 --> 00:16:12.656]  I know World Net Daily is split.
[00:16:12.656 --> 00:16:15.638]  But the old wise man over there, Corsi, is not split.
[00:16:15.638 --> 00:16:18.619]  He knows Trump, he knows this is for real.
[00:16:18.619 --> 00:16:20.820]  Cruz is putting a lot of heat on people.
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.903]  The Republican establishment is really dropping the hammer.
[00:16:24.903 --> 00:16:26.904]  We've been threatened.
[00:16:26.904 --> 00:16:30.086]  This is a serious moment in America, and for the world.
[00:16:30.086 --> 00:16:34.188]  Now, with that backdrop of Donald Trump on a suicide mission,
[00:16:35.859 --> 00:16:39.680]  And quite frankly, a lot of other people on the mission with him.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.820]  But he's right at the front.
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:48.542]  He's the general with the hat and the epaulets up there in front of these crowds of 30, 40, 50,000 people where they can infiltrate somebody.
[00:16:48.542 --> 00:16:51.283]  I mean, he is the big sitting duck.
[00:16:51.283 --> 00:16:55.704]  He is the man in the crosshairs.
[00:16:57.819 --> 00:17:00.842]  I'm just two or three rows back up here and I know how dangerous it is.
[00:17:00.842 --> 00:17:04.606]  Because I'm just in the general firing line direction.
[00:17:04.606 --> 00:17:15.937]  And all these cowards rolling over to the system, lying to themselves, back in Ted Cruz, back in Casey.
[00:17:15.937 --> 00:17:19.921]  Just remember you had a chance to save the country if we lose this thing.
[00:17:19.921 --> 00:17:20.341]  Just remember.
[00:17:23.424 --> 00:17:24.484]  Panicked Elite.
[00:17:24.484 --> 00:17:25.885]  Now, here's the backdrop.
[00:17:25.885 --> 00:17:27.525]  Our story's up on DrugsReport.com.
[00:17:27.525 --> 00:17:31.906]  It's the top story on the left-hand side.
[00:17:31.906 --> 00:17:38.608]  Panicked Elite buying bomb-proof luxury survival bunkers to escape civil unrest and disasters.
[00:17:38.608 --> 00:17:43.250]  Underground shelters protect high-net-worth individuals from the quote, general public.
[00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.310]  These are close quotes.
[00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:50.692]  Now, I told you more than a decade ago from our high-level sources and high-security home builders that it was exploding.
[00:17:53.629 --> 00:17:59.834]  That it was happening all over the Western world and that many elites were moving to New Zealand to escape the economic bubble.
[00:17:59.834 --> 00:18:13.805]  I then ran into, about six years ago, a billionaire defense contractor who told me that within five to six years, and we're now six years down the road, that quote, there wouldn't be an America.
[00:18:13.805 --> 00:18:14.766]  And I said, what do you mean?
[00:18:14.766 --> 00:18:17.488]  And they said, you know, you talk about it on your show.
[00:18:17.488 --> 00:18:21.912]  Let me just say, you are dead on and you're going to become very famous.
[00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:24.510]  This was six years ago.
[00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:25.650]  I was well known, but nothing like this.
[00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:26.691]  And I said, why do you say that?
[00:18:26.691 --> 00:18:35.658]  And they said, because what you're saying is what is happening and you are dead on.
[00:18:35.658 --> 00:18:37.980]  So stay alive and you're going to, quote, get very famous.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.041]  This isn't about Alex Jones getting very famous.
[00:18:40.041 --> 00:18:48.007]  This is like, you know, running around in the East Indies or something with a bunch of headhunters that want to eat you.
[00:18:48.007 --> 00:18:51.670]  You know, it's like, it's like standing out in that situation.
[00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:51.850]  But
[00:18:53.459 --> 00:18:55.801]  They're building serious hardcore bunkers everywhere.
[00:18:55.801 --> 00:19:13.417]  They're running to New Zealand because the bubble is going to make the Great Depression, if it fully pops, and the elite behave like I think they're going to behave, it'll be, let's not exaggerate, ten times worse than the Great Depression.
[00:19:13.417 --> 00:19:13.998]  Ten times worse.
[00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:17.480]  And so we're going to come back and play these videos and get to all this.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.602]  Panicked elite buying bomb-proof luxury survival bunkers to escape civil unrest disasters.
[00:19:21.602 --> 00:19:24.363]  And here's another one that's a flashback last week.
[00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:26.164]  Another InfoWars.com story.
[00:19:26.164 --> 00:19:27.085]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:19:27.085 --> 00:19:32.047]  Millionaires fleeing Chicago over fear of civil unrest.
[00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:34.388]  Elite are panicked over potential race riots.
[00:19:34.388 --> 00:19:36.429]  Crime wave.
[00:19:36.429 --> 00:19:39.310]  There's another story underneath the one on Drudge.
[00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:40.331]  London Telegraph.
[00:19:40.331 --> 00:19:42.252]  World sleepwalking into fresh crisis.
[00:19:43.553 --> 00:19:44.773]  Well, it's been engineered.
[00:19:44.773 --> 00:19:51.116]  I mean, the public's been put into this trance, so... Just get ready.
[00:19:51.116 --> 00:19:56.477]  One of my other concerns is Trump could get in, everything implodes, and they blame it on him.
[00:19:56.477 --> 00:19:57.638]  Stay with us.
[00:19:59.255 --> 00:20:02.858]  A good stove is at the top of the list for any serious survivalist.

[00:20:59.326 --> 00:21:01.648]  Are you concerned about the Power Grid?
[00:21:01.648 --> 00:21:04.070]  About the new war on the Power Grid?
[00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:09.635]  If so, this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear, and the most valuable.
[00:21:09.635 --> 00:21:10.636]  Here's why.
[00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:16.181]  An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the Power Grid has just been written.
[00:21:16.181 --> 00:21:20.065]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies.
[00:21:20.345 --> 00:21:23.607]  But only for a limited time to GCN listeners.
[00:21:23.607 --> 00:21:28.310]  He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:34.093]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book to you.
[00:21:34.093 --> 00:21:35.034]  Why do this?
[00:21:35.034 --> 00:21:38.896]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[00:21:38.896 --> 00:21:39.917]  The answer is simple.
[00:21:40.177 --> 00:21:44.339]  America's power grid is in grave danger, and most Americans are clueless.

[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.200]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:34.940]  Croix River.
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.161]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:22:37.161 --> 00:22:40.121]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:22:40.121 --> 00:22:41.002]  His excuse?
[00:22:41.002 --> 00:22:42.342]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:22:42.342 --> 00:22:43.942]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:22:43.942 --> 00:22:49.703]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[00:24:06.353 --> 00:24:12.875]  I'd rather sit around the backyard, look out over the hill country, drink some lemonade and listen to this.
[00:24:12.875 --> 00:24:17.937]  I saw the photograph.
[00:24:30.744 --> 00:24:33.446]  Wow, where to begin?
[00:24:33.446 --> 00:24:39.069]  He didn't notice the lights had changed?
[00:24:39.069 --> 00:24:41.851]  Crowd of people stood and stared!
[00:24:56.987 --> 00:25:03.132]  Look at this headline, this is coming up, another Paul Joseph Watson article.
[00:25:03.132 --> 00:25:08.176]  You ought to link this one on the one that's on Drudge, so people can see that it ties together as an update.
[00:25:08.176 --> 00:25:15.742]  Bill Clinton predicts global crisis that will divide the world, says Hillary will know what to do when it happens.
[00:25:15.742 --> 00:25:19.305]  They are cooking up a new global war, ladies and gentlemen, big time.
[00:25:19.305 --> 00:25:22.928]  We're going to talk about some of those global crises here in a moment.
[00:25:24.687 --> 00:25:34.456]  We have a high-level media source that, let's just say, does work for the Democratic Party or within those groups.
[00:25:34.456 --> 00:25:35.216]  Let's just say this.
[00:25:35.216 --> 00:25:37.759]  We have moles.
[00:25:37.759 --> 00:25:49.890]  And a very trusted mole let us know today, and I want to thank you, that in
[00:25:51.883 --> 00:25:53.987]  Major cities in the U.S.
[00:25:53.987 --> 00:26:04.824]  that when InfoWars reporters are on scene, they are going to be there on InfoWars.com regalia committing assaults and crimes and screaming racist stuff.
[00:26:06.107 --> 00:26:09.169]  As if our audience doesn't know you're going to run a false flag.
[00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:11.490]  And the media will take the bait.
[00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:15.532]  We will do face scan identification, which you can do with Google Online.
[00:26:15.532 --> 00:26:18.054]  It's publicly available.
[00:26:18.054 --> 00:26:19.775]  And we also have HUMET.
[00:26:19.775 --> 00:26:23.397]  Our listeners are so many millions, they will find out who you are.
[00:26:25.606 --> 00:26:27.267]  And it will blow up in your face.
[00:26:27.267 --> 00:26:32.369]  I almost didn't come on air and put this out because I almost want you to do it.
[00:26:32.369 --> 00:26:37.811]  See, I gotta play by the rules, so I have to encourage you not to commit crime.
[00:26:37.811 --> 00:26:40.892]  And I have to encourage you to be moral and good.
[00:26:40.892 --> 00:26:43.153]  And I have to encourage you to do the right thing.
[00:26:43.153 --> 00:26:48.955]  But let me just say this, you don't scare us.
[00:26:48.955 --> 00:26:51.796]  And I'm not gonna tell you to give it your best shot, but
[00:26:53.064 --> 00:26:55.846]  Our supporters don't commit crimes, it's well known.
[00:26:55.846 --> 00:27:00.128]  No matter how many times they've tried to frame us, you've been caught.
[00:27:00.128 --> 00:27:05.912]  The time they said I was trying to kill Michelle Malkin, it was her people behind me screaming it onto the camera.
[00:27:05.912 --> 00:27:07.693]  We blew you wide open.
[00:27:07.693 --> 00:27:13.137]  The times that they claimed all the other lies about us, it's not true, and our audience knows it's not true.
[00:27:13.137 --> 00:27:17.920]  And Roger Stone doesn't want violence, we didn't call for violence, they've got it all over CNN, all over MSNBC.
[00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.160]  I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.788]  And we know who you are.
[00:27:37.176 --> 00:27:39.057]  Of course, that's another point I should add.
[00:27:39.057 --> 00:27:42.598]  We know who the ringleaders are before you do it.
[00:27:42.598 --> 00:28:01.365]  I mean, I'm already thinking about this, like, well, we'll do face scan searches and people will email us who they are, because we caught them with Rand Paul when he was running for Senate and winning, when Democrats would dress up in haysheet outfits and hold up signs saying they hated Hispanics and black people, and we found out they were Democratic Party operatives, and we've caught folks doing it to Trump.
[00:28:01.365 --> 00:28:02.826]  I mean, it's gone on a lot.
[00:28:04.517 --> 00:28:13.664]  But I'm sitting here thinking how we're gonna catch you when we have people in your own organizations.
[00:28:13.664 --> 00:28:27.794]  Man, it's gotta really freak out some of the White House-run groups that we have people inside their organizations who communicate with us, not through our email here, obviously, but through other sources that then bring it to us.
[00:28:29.315 --> 00:28:34.059]  But imagine, the average leftist is in these organizations and they really believe all this.
[00:28:34.059 --> 00:28:41.605]  And then they're sitting around in meetings about how to frame people and how to create racial divisions and stuff, and they've heard me talk about it and they go, Alex Jones is actually right.
[00:28:41.605 --> 00:28:48.891]  And they flip right there over to the rebellion, over to the alliance, over to the defense of the republic, and they realize, wow, we're on the wrong side.
[00:28:48.891 --> 00:28:50.092]  Yeah, we're the real liberals.
[00:28:50.092 --> 00:28:56.378]  We're lower taxes, family, more rights, free speech, religious freedom.
[00:28:57.315 --> 00:28:58.497]  We're against all these wars.
[00:28:58.497 --> 00:29:00.100]  We're against torture.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.205]  We're patriots.
[00:29:03.205 --> 00:29:04.567]  I support Thomas Jefferson.
[00:29:05.549 --> 00:29:08.030]  I also admire, you know, people like George Washington.
[00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:16.475]  But when it comes down to political ideas and the founding of this country, that was the most hardcore, radical, libertarian ideas the world's ever seen before or since.
[00:29:16.475 --> 00:29:20.057]  I mean, you've got the nerve to call yourselves intellectuals?
[00:29:20.057 --> 00:29:29.982]  Because you, you know, you have like beards like that guy in the... All these men try to look like the guy from The Hangover, try to act, you know, ironic and cool, but you talk to a lot of them.
[00:29:29.982 --> 00:29:32.183]  I mean, these people can barely wipe their rear ends.
[00:29:34.349 --> 00:29:35.250]  I mean, I've talked to a lot of them.
[00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.812]  They can't talk.
[00:29:37.812 --> 00:29:40.854]  They just keep going, I'm intellectual, I'm intellectual, you're racist.
[00:29:40.854 --> 00:29:41.975]  And, really?
[00:29:41.975 --> 00:29:44.637]  I mean, we're against cancelling the election.
[00:29:44.637 --> 00:29:47.519]  We're against robbing Bernie Sanders of his votes and Donald Trump.
[00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:48.380]  Can't you stand for that?
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:49.741]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.741 --> 00:29:52.263]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.263 --> 00:29:54.945]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.016 --> 00:30:03.058]  Uber admits it gave data on 12 million users to U.S.
[00:30:03.058 --> 00:30:03.478]  government.
[00:30:03.478 --> 00:30:08.480]  Ridesharing company admits to complying with roughly 85% of requests from law enforcement.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.221]  Article up by Mikael Thelen at Infowars.com.
[00:30:11.221 --> 00:30:14.482]  Now according to the company's first ever transparency report, both U.S.
[00:30:14.482 --> 00:30:20.804]  law enforcement and regulators were provided with information on millions of users between July and December of 2015.
[00:30:20.804 --> 00:30:24.946]  We received requests from law enforcement agencies for information about our riders.
[00:30:25.126 --> 00:30:35.691]  Requests from law enforcement agencies at both the state and federal level included information on everything from pickup and drop-off locations to the identity of specific drivers and passengers.
[00:30:35.691 --> 00:30:43.515]  None of the inquiries are believed to be related to national security since Uber did not receive any requests issued under the provisions of national security statutes.
[00:30:43.695 --> 00:30:50.121]  But in many cases they send blanket requests explaining why the information is needed or how it will be used, Uber wrote.
[00:30:50.121 --> 00:30:55.366]  And while this kind of tripped out it doesn't include personal information, it can reveal patterns or behavior.
[00:30:55.366 --> 00:30:58.469]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com

[00:33:10.581 --> 00:33:14.163]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:14.163 --> 00:33:18.326]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:23.636 --> 00:33:28.641]  So, panicked elite are buying bomb-proof luxury survival bunkers to escape civil unrest and disasters.
[00:33:28.641 --> 00:33:29.842]  That dovetails with this story.
[00:33:29.842 --> 00:33:32.365]  Millionaires fleeing Chicago over fear of civil unrest.
[00:33:32.365 --> 00:33:37.470]  Elite are panicked over potential race riots and crime waves.
[00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:41.414]  Western governments are putting light posts up in every major city that we look at.
[00:33:42.506 --> 00:33:46.088]  With microphones and cameras to watch you.
[00:33:46.088 --> 00:33:55.354]  The feds have announced they want to get bills passed federally and locally to automatically just pull you over and then download your cell phone to see if you've quote been on it.
[00:33:55.354 --> 00:34:02.899]  I mean we are going into 1984 while millions of jihadist military age men flood the United States and Europe.
[00:34:03.854 --> 00:34:11.896]  It's in the hundreds of thousands here, millions and millions in Europe, with no background checks and fake IDs are given to them.
[00:34:11.896 --> 00:34:13.976]  So none of this has to do with security.
[00:34:13.976 --> 00:34:18.177]  It is all about total and complete domination and control.
[00:34:18.177 --> 00:34:24.739]  The more terror attacks there are, the more of our liberties the power structure and system can take, obviously.
[00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:26.499]  Now I want to get into these articles.
[00:34:26.499 --> 00:34:27.579]  One's from last week.
[00:34:27.579 --> 00:34:29.520]  The reason I brought it back up is it ties into this one.
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:50.002]  Panicked elite buying bomb-proof luxury survival bunkers escape civil unrest and disasters because while we're watching the establishment for the first time in modern history openly steal elections in the United States, cancel primaries, have party officials appoint the nominee, as we see all this unfolding,
[00:34:52.366 --> 00:35:04.764]  There's the backdrop of the economic meltdown that is already happening in most areas of the world, beginning here, and serious collapse is looming.
[00:35:04.764 --> 00:35:07.368]  And some say, hey, be positive.
[00:35:07.368 --> 00:35:08.170]  Be positive.
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.501]  And that will keep confidence up and will stay this off.
[00:35:12.501 --> 00:35:13.041]  No, it won't.
[00:35:13.041 --> 00:35:22.603]  It'll allow the establishment to control the collapse, hold us hostage with new banker bailouts and a new list of demands to not exacerbate the crisis they created.
[00:35:22.603 --> 00:35:25.543]  They hold us hostage with the crises they've created.
[00:35:25.543 --> 00:35:26.344]  That's what's going on.
[00:35:26.344 --> 00:35:27.904]  It's wrong.
[00:35:27.904 --> 00:35:32.405]  So if we don't get that narrative out to people and we aren't honest with people, we don't have a snowball chance in hell.
[00:35:33.865 --> 00:35:35.346]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:35:35.346 --> 00:35:39.130]  I want to open the phones up in this hour.
[00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:47.198]  And for about 20 minutes into the next hour, Stuart Rhodes joins us, the founder of Oath Keepers.
[00:35:47.198 --> 00:35:48.519]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:35:48.519 --> 00:35:48.559]  800-259-9231.
[00:35:56.343 --> 00:35:59.085]  What do you think of the steel going on?
[00:35:59.085 --> 00:36:00.806]  Where do you think it's all going?
[00:36:00.806 --> 00:36:02.648]  What dirty tricks do you think they're going to pull on Trump?
[00:36:02.648 --> 00:36:06.370]  What do you think about the elites just gearing up like it's the end of the world?
[00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:07.371]  Government digging in.
[00:36:07.371 --> 00:36:12.675]  The military training exponentially for collapse.
[00:36:12.675 --> 00:36:13.696]  Can it be averted?
[00:36:13.696 --> 00:36:15.497]  Boy, I sure hope so.
[00:36:15.497 --> 00:36:19.800]  I'm so busy trying to stave all this off and trying to warn people.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.262]  I'm not as prepared as I need to be.
[00:36:22.262 --> 00:36:25.885]  Believe me, just because I'm up here shooting my mouth off about being ready doesn't mean I am.
[00:36:26.894 --> 00:36:34.179]  Had a lot of family stuff, a lot of private stuff going on the last few years that messed up a lot of my plans and what I was trying to do.
[00:36:34.179 --> 00:36:36.940]  But I tell you, I'm not complaining.
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:52.710]  I'm just telling you, from my gut to yours, from my intellect to yours, from my soul to soul, navel to navel, forehead to forehead, there's basically no way we're wrong.
[00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:53.491]  And I wish I was wrong.
[00:36:54.568 --> 00:37:07.253]  I mean, I've gone from knowing I was pretty much right, going, man, I hope things work out and I'm proven wrong, man, I hope I get discredited, to now just, whoo, buddy, you need to get your family ready.
[00:37:07.253 --> 00:37:12.755]  You need to stop working so much and you need to get your butt in line.
[00:37:12.755 --> 00:37:16.196]  And then just the guilt at a flesh level that I'm not,
[00:37:18.484 --> 00:37:22.807]  Rolling over to the system and kissing their hind end or trying to get out of the country.
[00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:23.788]  But you know what?
[00:37:23.788 --> 00:37:28.851]  The coward dies a thousand deaths and my children wouldn't have a future if I rolled over to the system.
[00:37:28.851 --> 00:37:37.617]  They don't have a future if I try to run up the white flag and get out of Dodge.
[00:37:37.617 --> 00:37:38.598]  No, this is exciting.
[00:37:38.598 --> 00:37:40.079]  This is the Animating Contest of Liberty.
[00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:41.980]  I want to be like my ancestors.
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:45.202]  I want to be decent and strong and have honor.
[00:37:45.202 --> 00:37:46.563]  Well, we're going to get our medal tested, aren't we?
[00:37:49.158 --> 00:37:54.079]  Because this is only the beginning.
[00:37:54.079 --> 00:37:56.280]  Everybody knows it.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.000]  800-259-9231.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.421]  800-259-9231.
[00:37:59.421 --> 00:38:09.723]  Before we go any further, we're running a special we have not run in about six, eight months on one of our best-selling products.
[00:38:09.723 --> 00:38:11.364]  Unprecedented special.
[00:38:11.364 --> 00:38:15.465]  Get 25% off a super high-quality nootropic brain force.
[00:38:19.417 --> 00:38:24.541]  Both listeners and the InfoWars crew can't stop talking about what BrainForce has done for all of us.
[00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:32.408]  Unlike some energy drinks and supplements, BrainForce uses natural brain activation ingredients like Yerba Mate extract and Alpha-GPC.
[00:38:32.408 --> 00:38:34.930]  Some ingredients in BrainForce are prescription Europe.
[00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:39.454]  BrainForce and InfoWars Live already has hundreds of five-star reviews.
[00:38:39.454 --> 00:38:42.717]  You can review yourself along with all the research and other information.
[00:38:42.717 --> 00:38:44.959]  Go find out all the different things it's got in it.
[00:38:48.061 --> 00:38:48.701]  And why?
[00:38:48.701 --> 00:38:50.662]  It's a very, very strong formula.
[00:38:50.662 --> 00:38:52.102]  Extremely organic.
[00:38:52.102 --> 00:38:53.702]  Extremely purified.
[00:38:53.702 --> 00:38:56.043]  Extremely concentrated.
[00:38:56.043 --> 00:38:58.283]  Go read the reviews.
[00:38:58.283 --> 00:38:59.843]  Amazing product.
[00:38:59.843 --> 00:39:00.283]  5.0.
[00:39:00.283 --> 00:39:01.124]  I was skeptical.
[00:39:01.124 --> 00:39:02.024]  I'm not disappointed.
[00:39:02.024 --> 00:39:02.424]  5.0.
[00:39:02.424 --> 00:39:05.465]  We're just showing the latest reviews today.
[00:39:05.465 --> 00:39:08.045]  Major third-party site Power Reviews.
[00:39:08.045 --> 00:39:10.686]  This product does so much more than stated.
[00:39:10.686 --> 00:39:11.026]  Awesome.
[00:39:11.026 --> 00:39:13.526]  Well, that's how we operate here.
[00:39:13.526 --> 00:39:17.667]  This is a barbecue place in Texas that's a chain, but it's pretty good barbecue.
[00:39:20.023 --> 00:39:23.109]  And they say the worst barbecue in Texas.
[00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:27.577]  Everybody says they're the best.
[00:39:27.577 --> 00:39:31.845]  The worst supplements and nutraceuticals in the world.
[00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:42.742]  They don't do anything for you, these key amino acids and trace elements and key compounds and Bio PQQ and CoQ10.
[00:39:42.742 --> 00:39:46.868]  It's horrible, it's just a donation of the show to help fund the operation.
[00:39:46.868 --> 00:39:48.631]  This stuff does not do anything.
[00:39:48.631 --> 00:39:49.612]  Super Mel Vitality.
[00:39:50.373 --> 00:39:50.953]  No effect.
[00:39:50.953 --> 00:39:52.714]  Superfinal Vitality, no effect.
[00:39:52.714 --> 00:39:53.714]  Anthroplex, no effect.
[00:39:53.714 --> 00:39:56.935]  Of course, I'm being super sarcastic here.
[00:39:56.935 --> 00:40:06.258]  The easiest thing to really use and get results that you could notice if you're a man, normally in the morning, for whatever reason, I'll just leave it at that, is Superfinal Vitality.
[00:40:06.258 --> 00:40:17.362]  But seriously, unprecedented special, it's only running for a few days, 25% off, Brain Force, at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:40:17.362 --> 00:40:19.683]  That's the subsection of InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:40:21.081 --> 00:40:22.781]  A lot of this is just staple, high quality, low pricing.
[00:40:22.781 --> 00:40:24.502]  Knockout is just valerian root.
[00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:58.673]  And L-tryptophan and melatonin and a bunch of other just known, safe, healthy things for true restful sleep.
[00:40:58.673 --> 00:41:03.435]  And normally, again, one bottle of melatonin of this dose, same amount, will be $19.95.
[00:41:03.435 --> 00:41:07.697]  Knockout, it's eight other ingredients, they're big pills, same price.
[00:41:07.697 --> 00:41:10.859]  They're in a powder pill form, so you get huge absorption.
[00:41:10.859 --> 00:41:14.341]  Not as good as liquid, but better than a hard pill form.
[00:41:15.546 --> 00:41:23.008]  So you get a little hint, hint, you can break these open and put them in water and drink them that way as well after they're dissolved, or mix them in with fruit juice, whatever the case is.
[00:41:23.008 --> 00:41:34.071]  When I'm really fired up, really angry, got a lot of stuff going on and I'm kind of in war, war mode, which happens sometimes, I'm really kind of a nighttime person, so I gotta settle down sometimes.
[00:41:34.071 --> 00:41:37.072]  And it's better than drinking a six-pack to go to bed, I'll just be honest with you.
[00:41:37.072 --> 00:41:40.833]  I don't drink that six-pack now, folks, or that bottle of wine, I take two of these.
[00:41:41.909 --> 00:41:43.549]  That's what it takes, you know.
[00:41:43.549 --> 00:41:44.170]  I'm wound up.
[00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:46.850]  That's how God built me.
[00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:48.671]  That's why people think I'm on stimulants.
[00:41:48.671 --> 00:41:50.892]  I laugh at them.
[00:41:50.892 --> 00:41:57.073]  Man, I have like one cup of coffee a day, maybe a cup of tea, but I just don't need them.
[00:41:57.073 --> 00:42:00.014]  In fact, that might be my problem with brain force.
[00:42:00.014 --> 00:42:00.815]  I love brain force.
[00:42:00.815 --> 00:42:01.755]  People say it's their favorite
[00:42:02.659 --> 00:42:03.079]  Newtropic
[00:42:26.704 --> 00:42:30.745]  The umbrella site where you find all the products, Hillary, for prison shirts and things like that.
[00:42:30.745 --> 00:42:35.706]  Okay, I want to go to Cindy and Chris and Paul and Terry and Mark and many others.
[00:42:35.706 --> 00:42:38.026]  We'll do that here in a few minutes.
[00:42:38.026 --> 00:42:39.427]  But first off, the backdrop.
[00:42:39.427 --> 00:42:54.270]  I mean, it's mainline Bank of England, Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland, it's IMF, it's World Bank, it's Federal Reserve heads saying we're on the edge of a total implosion, it'll be worse than the Great Depression, sell everything you've got.
[00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:55.490]  I mean, you've seen those headlines.
[00:42:56.070 --> 00:43:00.292]  More fear-mongering than I ever did five years ago, when I was warning people.
[00:43:00.292 --> 00:43:03.374]  Now I don't really have to do that because we were unable to stop it.
[00:43:03.374 --> 00:43:05.014]  We couldn't get the policies changed.
[00:43:05.014 --> 00:43:08.276]  Now we're just facing how this thing's going to blow up.
[00:43:08.276 --> 00:43:12.098]  And it's like you're standing on top of a volcano.
[00:43:12.098 --> 00:43:15.019]  They say it's a 99% chance it's going to erupt in the next week.
[00:43:15.019 --> 00:43:19.582]  There's lava shooting up, occasional gas, ash starting to come out.
[00:43:19.582 --> 00:43:21.823]  But they think it's going to explode like Mount St.
[00:43:21.823 --> 00:43:23.904]  Helens and cover two states in ash.
[00:43:25.353 --> 00:43:27.355]  Or Pompeii?
[00:43:27.355 --> 00:43:29.156]  Or Krakatoa?
[00:43:29.156 --> 00:43:39.545]  And so I don't know when it's going to blow, I don't know which side of the mountain's going to blow out, I don't know which direction it's going to rain ash, I don't know how big it's going to be, but baby, it's a-biggin'.
[00:43:39.545 --> 00:43:51.015]  And it's like a, you know, cheesy Star Trek movie where they're on some unstable planet and there's plastic boulders rolling down the hill and we're... Sir, the planet won't hold much longer, you've got to beam out of there!
[00:43:51.892 --> 00:44:03.344]  I mean, I don't know what's going to happen, but baby, we're sitting on top of a ton of TNT with lobotomized chimpanzees running around with flamethrowers.
[00:44:03.344 --> 00:44:05.686]  And there's fuses sticking up everywhere.
[00:44:05.686 --> 00:44:09.289]  And elites are digging in like it's the end of the world.
[00:44:09.289 --> 00:44:10.571]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:44:12.065 --> 00:44:29.144]  I just know they're stealing and robbing and banning speech and starting wars and stealing elections and just running around like psychos everywhere while they build armored fortresses and get helicopters warmed up with the crews on one hour standby.
[00:44:29.144 --> 00:44:31.967]  And private jets are on one hour standbys all over the place.
[00:44:34.761 --> 00:44:36.061]  What do they got planned?
[00:44:36.061 --> 00:44:39.122]  Maybe they've just stolen so much that we could flee with none pursued.
[00:44:39.122 --> 00:44:40.482]  Maybe things aren't that dangerous.
[00:44:40.482 --> 00:44:42.983]  They've just stolen trillions, gotten away with murder.
[00:44:42.983 --> 00:44:51.665]  Major government institutions and banks are running snuff film, white slavery rings, narcotics traffic, slavery's been brought back all over the world.
[00:44:51.665 --> 00:44:52.925]  Just total insanity.
[00:44:52.925 --> 00:44:54.966]  And they can't believe what they've gotten away with.
[00:44:54.966 --> 00:44:56.086]  I don't know.
[00:44:56.086 --> 00:44:56.966]  Maybe it's not bad.
[00:44:56.966 --> 00:45:00.187]  Maybe that's the 5% hope.
[00:45:00.187 --> 00:45:03.408]  That they are just paranoid themselves.
[00:45:03.408 --> 00:45:03.688]  I don't know.
[00:45:05.598 --> 00:45:17.469]  But panicked elite buying bomb-proof luxury survival bunkers to escape civil unrest and disaster, underground shelters protect high net worth individuals from the general public.
[00:45:17.469 --> 00:45:24.636]  Panicked members of the elite are buying luxury bomb-proof underground survival bunkers because they fear mass civil unrest on the horizon.
[00:45:24.636 --> 00:45:27.939]  The company behind the construction of these sprawling complexes
[00:45:29.019 --> 00:45:40.746]  Vivos says the facilities are for the protection, quote, of high net worth individuals in the event of an apocalyptic style scenarios during which millions will perish or yet struggle to survive as victims.
[00:45:40.746 --> 00:45:47.070]  If our power grid goes down within about a month, the country will look like the movie The Road with Viggo Mortensen.
[00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:48.131]  And he came on the show, by the way.
[00:45:48.131 --> 00:45:50.712]  He's a listener and agreed with me.
[00:45:50.712 --> 00:45:53.674]  Where will you go when pandemonium strikes?
[00:45:53.674 --> 00:45:56.176]  Ask a promo for the luxury shelters.
[00:45:58.018 --> 00:46:05.205]  The biggest facility called Europa One is located in Germany and is one of the most fortified and massive underground survival shelters on earth.
[00:46:05.205 --> 00:46:12.071]  Deep below the limestone mountain and is safely secured from the general public behind sealed and secured walls, gates and blast doors.
[00:46:12.071 --> 00:46:13.172]  Open the blast doors!
[00:46:13.172 --> 00:46:15.114]  Open the blast doors!
[00:46:15.114 --> 00:46:16.615]  Imperial troops have entered the base!
[00:46:16.615 --> 00:46:18.097]  Imperial troops have entered the base!
[00:46:19.246 --> 00:46:21.849]  The biggest facility, Europa One.
[00:46:21.849 --> 00:46:28.997]  Journalist Lynn Paramore said she also visited another facility in Indiana, which the former Cold War Communications Facility.
[00:46:28.997 --> 00:46:29.918]  It just goes on and on.
[00:46:29.918 --> 00:46:33.922]  And they're building them, and they've got seed vaults, and they're running to New Zealand.
[00:46:33.922 --> 00:46:36.445]  And I'm just sitting there looking at my kids.
[00:46:36.445 --> 00:46:39.428]  We're sitting around a campfire roasting hot dogs, and I'm just like...
[00:46:43.022 --> 00:46:46.725]  Oh man, why is the country so, why is the world so pathetic?
[00:46:46.725 --> 00:47:00.994]  You look at these yuppies and these trendies and all of them, I mean, they are entitled, they're anti-free speech, they're arrogant, they think they own you and your family, they hate just anything decent and call themselves liberals, they will be like Piranha.
[00:47:00.994 --> 00:47:04.777]  The Pentagon's done studies, so have the British, so have other, the Russians did studies, they all found the same thing.
[00:47:06.243 --> 00:47:16.713]  Within 3 or 4 days of no food or water, well without 3 days of no water, people die, but within 3 or 4 days of reduced food and water, most people turn to robbery.
[00:47:16.713 --> 00:47:17.994]  Within 10 days, over 90% turn to murder.
[00:47:17.994 --> 00:47:19.715]  And within 16 days, almost 100% turn to cannibalism.
[00:47:28.231 --> 00:47:34.154]  It's like 97, 98, depending on which national study, in wartime scenarios or in collab zones.
[00:47:34.154 --> 00:47:39.696]  The other 3%, 4%, they commit suicide.
[00:47:39.696 --> 00:47:45.018]  You go into the house and the family's hung, and the dogs have been killed with a gun, and the people are dead.
[00:47:45.018 --> 00:47:48.080]  And then the people eat them as a meal.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:54.362]  So, I don't know, I might actually eat people for my kids for a while.
[00:47:54.362 --> 00:47:55.963]  I thought there was some light at the end of the tunnel.
[00:47:57.924 --> 00:47:59.185]  Gotta think about those things, that's why.
[00:47:59.185 --> 00:48:03.606]  And I wouldn't go out and hunt people, I guess, at first.
[00:48:03.606 --> 00:48:06.787]  People would try to kill me to eat me, I would try to kill them to eat them.
[00:48:06.787 --> 00:48:08.588]  You know what?
[00:48:08.588 --> 00:48:13.909]  I'm not being tongue-in-cheek here, but these are the discussions people have to have here.
[00:48:13.909 --> 00:48:14.770]  I don't know.
[00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:17.931]  I'd probably do anything for my girls.
[00:48:17.931 --> 00:48:20.612]  I got a life force instinct.
[00:48:20.612 --> 00:48:23.733]  It gets downright evil at certain areas, doesn't it?
[00:48:23.733 --> 00:48:24.253]  Doesn't yours?
[00:48:25.933 --> 00:48:30.696]  What do you think of these people that can't skin bucks or run trot lines and they haven't been in a fight?
[00:48:30.696 --> 00:48:31.817]  And never had a broken bone?
[00:48:31.817 --> 00:48:35.579]  What are they gonna do when stuff collapses?
[00:48:35.579 --> 00:48:40.403]  They're gonna run around like screaming lemmings off the edge of cliffs, foaming at the mouth.
[00:48:40.403 --> 00:48:41.763]  Let's go to a clip here.
[00:48:41.763 --> 00:48:45.486]  Oh, but at first, the government's got food stored everywhere to make everybody submit.
[00:48:45.486 --> 00:48:51.270]  It's gonna roll it out to them at the emergency centers and there'll be troublemakers that are locked up in the emergency centers.
[00:48:53.336 --> 00:49:07.407]  Which the army now calls re-education camps, and then they'll all be fed by the government and do whatever the government says, and they'll be the howling, arrogant mobs stomping around, demanding nationalization of this, nationalization of that.
[00:49:07.407 --> 00:49:13.351]  For a nation to fall, it has to be made morally bankrupt, and baby, you can stick a fork in us, we're done.
[00:49:14.352 --> 00:49:17.494]  Except for 20-30% of the public that's still moral and decent.
[00:49:17.494 --> 00:49:23.538]  And we're the people that Homeland Security and the FBI and all the training manuals say are the enemy.
[00:49:23.538 --> 00:49:28.241]  Veterans, gun owners, constitutionalists, the groups with the lowest crime rate.
[00:49:28.241 --> 00:49:36.227]  And the people that are smart enough to not want to go to a re-education camp in your city with a couple hundred thousand screaming millennials.
[00:49:40.384 --> 00:49:49.788]  They want to tie you up to a pole so they can beat you mercilessly and have their ceremony of manhood or femininity.
[00:49:49.788 --> 00:50:00.973]  Their ceremony of dishonor, like Ted Cruz going all over going, yeah, I tell you, losing loser Trump, he's lost everything.
[00:50:00.973 --> 00:50:01.913]  Yeah, he's lost 11 states.
[00:50:03.575 --> 00:50:07.677]  Those are states he's gone where Trump won and took the votes after.
[00:50:07.677 --> 00:50:12.720]  And now they just cancel another four states and don't even have elections.
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.341]  And then he gets there and goes, it's a democracy.
[00:50:14.341 --> 00:50:15.061]  I have the clips.
[00:50:15.061 --> 00:50:16.222]  There's new ones.
[00:50:16.222 --> 00:50:17.002]  Played them yesterday.
[00:50:17.002 --> 00:50:17.322]  Old ones.
[00:50:17.322 --> 00:50:18.063]  There's new ones.
[00:50:18.063 --> 00:50:20.284]  That's the talking point.
[00:50:20.284 --> 00:50:23.145]  Loser Trump.
[00:50:23.145 --> 00:50:25.106]  Loser Donald.
[00:50:25.106 --> 00:50:27.247]  He's lost.
[00:50:27.247 --> 00:50:31.049]  And he's mad and he's upset and he's a sore loser.
[00:50:31.049 --> 00:50:31.850]  When you fixed it.
[00:50:34.226 --> 00:50:35.146]  And that's what this is all about.
[00:50:35.146 --> 00:50:43.349]  These people just steal everything, they lie to everyone's face, and they tell you you're mentally ill because you're not a thief.
[00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:45.050]  That's what the government teaches.

[00:52:58.112 --> 00:53:02.357]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:53:02.357 --> 00:53:02.978]  It's true.
[00:53:02.978 --> 00:53:07.123]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:53:07.123 --> 00:53:09.526]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.

[00:54:12.355 --> 00:54:15.277]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:54:15.277 --> 00:54:17.719]  We've got 25% off one of our best products, BrainForce.
[00:54:17.719 --> 00:54:22.963]  A great way to try it at this introductory price.
[00:54:22.963 --> 00:54:24.044]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:54:24.044 --> 00:54:25.165]  Okay, I want to go to your calls.
[00:54:25.165 --> 00:54:26.546]  I need to play these clips.
[00:54:29.411 --> 00:54:30.992]  But here's the headline of the London Telegraph.
[00:54:30.992 --> 00:54:33.694]  And again, back to the headline.
[00:54:33.694 --> 00:54:35.336]  That's the story on DrugsReport.com.
[00:54:35.336 --> 00:54:37.758]  Top story, left hand side, from Infowars.com.
[00:54:53.427 --> 00:55:01.932]  And then it ties into this headline, millionaires fleeing Chicago over fears of civil unrest from last week.
[00:55:01.932 --> 00:55:03.773]  And that's in the Chicago Tribune.
[00:55:03.773 --> 00:55:12.738]  But we wrote a boil-down story showing other newspapers saying the same thing around the country and around the world, just so you know it's not one little isolated incident.
[00:55:14.104 --> 00:55:18.668]  That's why an Infowars.com story is so much better than, say, a New York Times article or a Chicago Tribune.
[00:55:18.668 --> 00:55:22.331]  Because they'll always report on one thing and isolate it.
[00:55:22.331 --> 00:55:25.134]  We'll connect the dots.
[00:55:25.134 --> 00:55:27.656]  Or put the dots up there and let you connect them.
[00:55:27.656 --> 00:55:28.517]  But it goes through all that.
[00:55:28.517 --> 00:55:33.662]  I'll go through more of that in the next hour as we take your phone calls, get into the campaign, the latest outrages and more.
[00:55:33.662 --> 00:55:35.784]  But here's that clip, about a minute clip.
[00:55:37.268 --> 00:55:44.254]  From RT reporting on the panic, the leap buying bomb-proof luxury survival bunkers to escape civil unrest and disasters.
[00:55:44.254 --> 00:55:44.555]  Here it is.
[00:55:45.413 --> 00:55:58.942]  I began to hear at World Economic Forum meetings in Davos that there were some whisperings in the corridors about very wealthy people buying airstrips in New Zealand and preparing for all kinds of disaster scenarios.
[00:55:58.942 --> 00:56:09.550]  So I got interested and started doing research and I found a guy, Robert Vicino, who is the CEO of a company called Vivos, and he builds these luxurious underground shelters.
[00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:12.592]  The one that I visited in Indiana is in a former Cold War
[00:56:13.192 --> 00:56:14.033]  I don't think so.
[00:56:36.775 --> 00:56:46.837]  And this is for wealthy people who are concerned about various disaster scenarios, but a common theme among them is a fear of civil unrest, a fear of an uprising from the 99%.
[00:56:46.837 --> 00:56:51.798]  The real fear is the breakdown of civilization.
[00:56:51.798 --> 00:56:53.479]  You've got 7.5 billion people.
[00:56:53.479 --> 00:56:54.859]  It's a time bomb.
[00:56:54.859 --> 00:56:59.220]  You think army ants can eat a whole forest in a matter of hours in Brazil?
[00:57:02.808 --> 00:57:09.409]  As modern and as urban as the population is of the globe now, you have a major meltdown.
[00:57:09.409 --> 00:57:15.210]  It will be catastrophic beyond our imaginings.
[00:57:15.210 --> 00:57:26.133]  Because of the immorality, the domestication, the ignorance, the stupidness of the average Bernie Sanders supporter.
[00:57:26.133 --> 00:57:27.333]  The average Hillary supporter.
[00:57:28.336 --> 00:57:30.577]  But also the average soft Republican.
[00:57:30.577 --> 00:57:35.299]  I mean, you go out and you look at the soft people.
[00:57:35.299 --> 00:57:36.279]  And look, I'm not bragging.
[00:57:36.279 --> 00:57:37.980]  Compared to really tough people, I'm not that tough.
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:42.881]  You know, I can deadlift 400 pounds, you know, six, seven, eight times.
[00:57:42.881 --> 00:57:46.883]  More than that, except my hands tear open.
[00:57:46.883 --> 00:57:49.464]  I mean, I can hike 30 miles with a pack on my back right now.
[00:57:52.992 --> 00:57:55.214]  Average person wouldn't even think about doing that.
[00:57:55.214 --> 00:57:56.555]  I know how to get fresh water.
[00:57:56.555 --> 00:57:58.276]  I know how to get fresh game.
[00:57:58.276 --> 00:58:04.361]  I know, and I've got sortable foods and medical gear, because if there's a small chance this could happen, I've got to be ready.
[00:58:04.361 --> 00:58:13.648]  Folks, there's a guaranteed chance we're going to have a meltdown, but it's going to be controlled, and they're going to roll out the FEMA camps and the food and the socialism and the re-engineering of society.
[00:58:13.648 --> 00:58:19.293]  It's such a diabolical, sickening, cloward, and piven plan, writ large across the world.
[00:58:19.293 --> 00:58:20.834]  And what's that plan?
[00:58:20.834 --> 00:58:21.675]  One of many?
[00:58:21.675 --> 00:58:22.075]  It's public?
[00:58:23.052 --> 00:58:37.615]  Create such a welfare state of domesticated people, things collapse, and then use that to bring in a new order of control with the servile slaves that never knew what it was like to go out and shoot a squirrel or go out and pick wild vegetables and feed yourself.
[00:58:37.615 --> 00:58:39.936]  Folks, they can't tie their shoelaces.
[00:58:39.936 --> 00:58:42.637]  Trendies are into not having shoelaces.
[00:58:42.637 --> 00:58:44.657]  They're into being jellyfish.
[00:58:44.657 --> 00:58:46.397]  They're into being fools.
[00:58:46.397 --> 00:58:48.318]  It's their religion is to be filth.
[00:58:49.099 --> 00:58:55.582]  Uh, yeah, Alex, first of all, I want to say, Bigfoot 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[00:58:55.582 --> 00:58:56.542]  I use them all.
[00:58:56.542 --> 00:58:57.543]  They're phenomenal.
[00:58:57.543 --> 00:58:58.283]  They work.
[00:58:58.283 --> 00:58:59.103]  Buy them, folks.
[00:58:59.103 --> 00:58:59.543]  Thank you, brother.
[00:58:59.543 --> 00:59:01.844]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[00:59:01.844 --> 00:59:07.747]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[00:59:07.747 --> 00:59:09.748]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[00:59:09.748 --> 00:59:15.130]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:16.310]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[00:59:16.310 --> 00:59:20.072]  I buy all the Nutraceuticals, Pacu FX, Nascent Iodine.
[00:59:20.072 --> 00:59:20.993]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:59:20.993 --> 00:59:22.013]  Have they worked for you?
[00:59:22.013 --> 00:59:24.895]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[00:59:24.895 --> 00:59:26.215]  What products are you taking?
[00:59:26.215 --> 00:59:34.239]  Everything from Super Male to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA Force.
[00:59:34.239 --> 00:59:37.701]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[00:59:37.881 --> 00:59:42.928]  Visit Infowarslives.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[00:59:42.928 --> 00:59:45.091]  That's Infowarslives.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:45.091 --> 00:59:47.174]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:08.422 --> 01:00:09.283]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.283 --> 01:00:10.644]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:10.644 --> 01:00:15.849]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.849 --> 01:00:25.798]  Okay, we've got Stuart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers, joining us to talk about all the push for martial law, the talk of collapse of economies, the elite buying bunkers.
[01:00:25.798 --> 01:00:29.462]  That's in the Chicago Tribune, the New York Times, Infowars.com.
[01:00:29.462 --> 01:00:31.744]  Has a story boiling it down that's on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:00:33.308 --> 01:00:45.155]  Right now, they've upped the game, now saying that Trump's a sore loser, that he doesn't like they've cancelled primaries in multiple states, or that they're taking delegates that were pledged to him and he won the popular vote.
[01:00:45.155 --> 01:00:52.999]  So, winning the popular vote, or having the vote cancelled where you're ahead in polls, is now sore losing.
[01:00:52.999 --> 01:00:57.982]  Now, I'm not the one saying that, they're the ones saying it, but Cruz will never mention when he's on Glenn Beck what he's doing.
[01:00:59.298 --> 01:01:00.238]  I played the clips yesterday.
[01:01:00.238 --> 01:01:02.920]  There's new ones today, but I want to start going to your calls right now.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.382]  We got Cindy, Paul, Chris, Mark, Terry, and many others.
[01:01:06.382 --> 01:01:08.463]  Let's go ahead and go to Cindy in Pennsylvania.
[01:01:08.463 --> 01:01:11.004]  Thanks for holding.
[01:01:11.004 --> 01:01:12.004]  Hello, Alex.
[01:01:12.004 --> 01:01:14.486]  I'd like to make a few short points.
[01:01:14.486 --> 01:01:16.787]  Sure.
[01:01:16.787 --> 01:01:25.331]  I think Ted Cruz has been a sleeper cell for years, and I don't know if you saw that video where he wants to rule the world?
[01:01:25.331 --> 01:01:25.691]  Yes.
[01:01:25.691 --> 01:01:27.172]  That explains it right there.
[01:01:27.557 --> 01:01:33.581]  They probably grabbed him in college because he has such a high IQ that they farmed him then.
[01:01:33.581 --> 01:01:39.004]  And secondly, I would like to see you come out with some t-shirts, maybe St.
[01:01:39.004 --> 01:01:44.408]  Michael, the patron saint of soldiers, police, and all warriors.
[01:01:44.408 --> 01:01:47.490]  That's how we could identify each other, with St.
[01:01:47.490 --> 01:01:49.811]  Michael as our patron saint.
[01:01:49.811 --> 01:01:55.555]  I gave out keychains to all of the local police around here so they knew I was in unity with them at Christmas time.
[01:01:56.095 --> 01:01:57.416]  Well, and again, I want to be clear.
[01:01:57.416 --> 01:01:59.317]  The globals have tried to corrupt the police.
[01:01:59.317 --> 01:02:00.417]  There's a lot of problems.
[01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:01.998]  The Justice Department's very evil.
[01:02:01.998 --> 01:02:04.499]  But absolutely, we do not want a civil war.
[01:02:04.499 --> 01:02:16.526]  And the patriots and libertarians of this country want to be identified with the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the rule of law, family, private property, right to self-defense, and not randomly shooting cops in the back of the head.
[01:02:16.526 --> 01:02:20.328]  So the police know that we're on the side of honorable men and women in uniform.
[01:02:20.328 --> 01:02:22.509]  When they try to come for the patriots, though,
[01:02:23.484 --> 01:02:24.265]  Then it's a different story.
[01:02:24.265 --> 01:02:26.367]  And that's why we don't want to have a fight up front with them.
[01:02:26.367 --> 01:02:28.308]  We want to give them a chance to do the right thing.
[01:02:28.308 --> 01:02:35.935]  And since I've put this olive branch out the last six, seven years, they have really taken to it because they understand what's happening and they want to save the country as well.
[01:02:35.935 --> 01:02:39.678]  They use bad examples on purpose to create a civil war in this country.
[01:02:39.678 --> 01:02:41.060]  And I totally agree with you.
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:45.103]  We need to reach out to police and military now.
[01:02:45.103 --> 01:02:46.004]  Right.
[01:02:46.004 --> 01:02:47.826]  And have you heard of Dennis Michael Lynch?
[01:02:49.815 --> 01:02:50.556]  Michael Lynch.
[01:02:50.556 --> 01:02:51.196]  It rings a bell.
[01:02:51.196 --> 01:02:51.536]  Who's he?
[01:02:51.536 --> 01:02:53.898]  Dennis Michael Lynch.
[01:02:53.898 --> 01:02:56.299]  He has a show on Newsmax.
[01:02:56.299 --> 01:02:58.080]  It's called Unfiltered.
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.681]  He's a great patriot.
[01:02:59.681 --> 01:03:01.282]  I would love to see him on your show.
[01:03:01.282 --> 01:03:01.842]  Let's get him on.
[01:03:01.842 --> 01:03:03.123]  I love a lot of those Newsmax shows.
[01:03:03.123 --> 01:03:05.024]  They get a lot of big guests as well.
[01:03:05.024 --> 01:03:05.865]  Great idea.
[01:03:05.865 --> 01:03:09.987]  People say, why do you have people on from other outfits like World Net Daily or Newsmax?
[01:03:09.987 --> 01:03:11.568]  I don't care.
[01:03:11.568 --> 01:03:16.011]  It's not about I'm the big show and I, you know, it's only our people on.
[01:03:16.011 --> 01:03:16.992]  I promote everybody.
[01:03:17.732 --> 01:03:21.334]  Even news outlets that are usually disinformation.
[01:03:21.334 --> 01:03:25.656]  When I see a story in the New York Times that I think is really accurate or thought-provoking, we link to it.
[01:03:25.656 --> 01:03:32.299]  Or if it's a lie, we'll post it and have a note saying, look at this complete garbage, watch our video below exposing it.
[01:03:32.299 --> 01:03:34.720]  But sometimes people see articles on my site.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:43.724]  There was an article up there the other day by Steve Watson about Trump saying he thinks we should waterboard ISIS because they're so evil and so corrupt that they don't deserve regular rules.
[01:03:44.653 --> 01:03:45.253]  Oh, of course.
[01:04:04.031 --> 01:04:06.395]  And, um, I'm behind you 100%, Alex.
[01:04:06.395 --> 01:04:08.579]  I pray for you and your family every day.
[01:04:08.579 --> 01:04:09.500]  Well, ma'am, I need it.
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:09.961]  I need it.
[01:04:09.961 --> 01:04:10.301]  I need it.
[01:04:10.301 --> 01:04:11.643]  There's so much stuff going on.
[01:04:11.643 --> 01:04:15.850]  I've been so blessed and so protected, and I really need your prayers.
[01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:16.451]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:16.451 --> 01:04:18.094]  Got it.
[01:04:19.005 --> 01:04:19.765]  That's a great idea.
[01:04:19.765 --> 01:04:20.766]  You know, even if you're not Catholic.
[01:04:20.766 --> 01:04:22.807]  I personally am not Catholic, but I'm a Christian.
[01:04:22.807 --> 01:04:28.070]  You know, the idea of saints was in the original Bible even before, you know, Catholicism.
[01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:36.254]  And, you know, I think it is good to venerate professions and archetypes and things, you know, through the saints.
[01:04:36.254 --> 01:04:37.595]  And it's a good idea just to remind you.
[01:04:37.595 --> 01:04:39.316]  Like, I personally keep saying I'm going to do it.
[01:04:39.316 --> 01:04:40.276]  I'm not a jewelry guy.
[01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:40.937]  I never have been.
[01:04:40.937 --> 01:04:44.399]  I don't like wearing a wedding ring, but I do wear a watch occasionally.
[01:04:45.279 --> 01:04:48.264]  But I think I'm going to get a nice little silver cross or something.
[01:04:48.264 --> 01:04:51.569]  Just to remind me of who's in charge.
[01:04:51.569 --> 01:04:53.252]  Plus, in times like this, it's very comforting.
[01:04:53.252 --> 01:04:54.033]  I'll be honest.
[01:04:54.033 --> 01:04:55.135]  Plus, they want to ban it.
[01:04:55.135 --> 01:04:55.836]  That's the real reason.
[01:04:55.836 --> 01:04:57.219]  They want to ban the cross.
[01:04:57.219 --> 01:04:57.840]  I'm going to get one.
[01:04:58.803 --> 01:05:00.825]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[01:05:00.825 --> 01:05:04.249]  Textilizer wants to be a breathalyzer for your cell phone.
[01:05:04.249 --> 01:05:06.090]  Article up by Gizmodo.
[01:05:06.090 --> 01:05:09.554]  Distracted driving is a hazard up there with drinking and driving.
[01:05:09.554 --> 01:05:15.620]  A solution proposed in a draft New York legislation would solve that using a roadside phone analyzer.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:15.860]  I think?
[01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:38.671]  Sure, buddy.
[01:05:38.671 --> 01:05:42.074]  The actual content of a message, picture, or game would not be revealed.
[01:05:42.074 --> 01:05:43.595]  Yeah, I don't believe that one.
[01:05:43.595 --> 01:05:46.898]  Seeing as how the NSA and others are putting their fingers in everything.
[01:05:46.898 --> 01:05:56.127]  A driver under suspicion of distracted driving will be under extreme pressure to unlock their phone to prove their innocence, giving officers full access to everything on a handset.
[01:05:56.127 --> 01:05:58.369]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[01:05:58.769 --> 01:06:09.314]  You're investing in your health and supporting the InfoWar when you visit InfoWarsLife.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine and all the great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:09.314 --> 01:06:15.217]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[01:06:15.217 --> 01:06:17.298]  Iodine is key, is paramount,
[01:06:17.398 --> 01:06:22.441]  And there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[01:06:22.441 --> 01:06:31.408]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[01:06:31.408 --> 01:06:35.310]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:38.132]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[01:06:38.132 --> 01:06:42.215]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine,
[01:06:42.335 --> 01:06:43.856]  I've been working all day.
[01:06:43.856 --> 01:06:45.417]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:07:11.118 --> 01:07:12.479]  I get in here at 830.
[01:07:12.479 --> 01:07:14.380]  I was kind of run down.
[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:16.341]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[01:07:16.341 --> 01:07:18.222]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:07:18.222 --> 01:07:20.043]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[01:07:20.043 --> 01:07:21.103]  I popped two of them.
[01:07:21.103 --> 01:07:23.384]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[01:07:23.384 --> 01:07:25.325]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[01:07:25.325 --> 01:07:26.826]  It's got four and a half stars.
[01:07:26.826 --> 01:07:28.167]  People really love it.
[01:07:28.167 --> 01:07:28.767]  Read about it.
[01:07:28.767 --> 01:07:32.609]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[01:07:32.609 --> 01:07:37.872]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:07:38.072 --> 01:07:42.114]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[01:07:42.114 --> 01:07:48.238]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[01:07:48.238 --> 01:07:54.161]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:08:01.767 --> 01:08:08.393]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.393 --> 01:08:24.467]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:24.467 --> 01:08:27.830]  Donald needs to understand he's not Michael Corleone.
[01:08:28.877 --> 01:08:37.265]  I understand that Donald has had some very shady business deals with people that are currently in prison, mobsters.
[01:08:37.265 --> 01:08:42.931]  But the presidency should not be la cosa nostra.
[01:08:42.931 --> 01:08:49.757]  And it is wrong for a presidential candidate or for his henchmen.
[01:08:49.757 --> 01:08:51.099]  You know what's crazy about that?
[01:08:52.327 --> 01:08:54.209]  Is there the ones canceling elections?
[01:08:54.209 --> 01:08:57.132]  They're the ones doing dirty tricks against Ben Carson.
[01:08:57.132 --> 01:09:00.075]  They're the ones doing all this.
[01:09:00.075 --> 01:09:05.721]  And then they just turn around in another clip I have and say that Donald Trump is a sore loser.
[01:09:05.721 --> 01:09:06.902]  He's Donald the loser.
[01:09:06.902 --> 01:09:10.846]  And I've won the last 11 states, which isn't even true.
[01:09:12.082 --> 01:09:14.843]  And he's just mad I'm winning the popular vote.
[01:09:14.843 --> 01:09:16.564]  This is democracy.
[01:09:16.564 --> 01:09:22.247]  When they're cancelling elections and having party bosses give him all the delegates, like Colorado.
[01:09:22.247 --> 01:09:23.967]  And Hillary's doing that.
[01:09:23.967 --> 01:09:25.508]  All over the place to Bernie Sanders, too.
[01:09:25.508 --> 01:09:28.029]  This has never been done like this.
[01:09:28.029 --> 01:09:30.790]  You can have a contested deal at the convention.
[01:09:30.790 --> 01:09:33.972]  That's when it's close, but nothing like this.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:43.245]  And then of course you have Ted Cruz right here when he was 18 years old about what he aspired to do when he grew up.
[01:09:43.245 --> 01:09:43.625]  Here it is.
[01:09:43.625 --> 01:09:46.867]  Is that like sweat on my butt?
[01:09:46.867 --> 01:09:51.971]  No, no, I see what you want me to do, what I want to do in life.
[01:09:51.971 --> 01:09:59.157]  Well, my aspiration is to, uh, oh, I don't know, be in a teen tit film like that guy who played Horatio.
[01:09:59.157 --> 01:10:03.300]  You know, he was in Malibu Bikini Beach Shop.
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.581]  Well, other than that, uh,
[01:10:05.558 --> 01:10:06.979]  Take over the world.
[01:10:06.979 --> 01:10:07.740]  World domination.
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:09.322]  You have to rule everything.
[01:10:09.322 --> 01:10:12.324]  Rich, powerful, that sort of stuff.
[01:10:12.324 --> 01:10:14.827]  And then here's his dad.
[01:10:14.827 --> 01:10:19.751]  His dad thought about this.
[01:10:19.751 --> 01:10:21.653]  World domination.
[01:10:21.653 --> 01:10:26.517]  Do you think Ted's going to rule the world one day?
[01:10:26.517 --> 01:10:27.018]  I hope not.
[01:10:30.313 --> 01:10:31.956]  So, there you go.
[01:10:31.956 --> 01:10:35.021]  And then you got Donald Trump, who has some issues.
[01:10:35.021 --> 01:10:38.747]  I don't agree with him on surveillance things and torture and stuff like that.
[01:10:38.747 --> 01:10:41.552]  I'm no friend of ISIS, but you can't stoop to their level.
[01:10:41.552 --> 01:10:43.315]  And it gives you bad intelligence, obviously, but...
[01:10:45.322 --> 01:11:09.654]  Have we ever seen a moment in world politics where the entire globe, the Vatican, the Communist Chinese, the British government, the German government, the Saudi Arabian government, the Mexican government, everybody says you can't have Donald Trump, and they take stuff he says that's common sense, like we can't have an open border and pay for everybody to have their kids here free, nobody else does that, or if we're not checking the Muslims coming in, stop it all until we start checking people again.
[01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:23.381]  And then they just run around screaming racist, racist, racist, and then have anti-Trump people go all over the country, universities, you name it, and physically attack anyone who tries to have a Trump rally.
[01:11:23.381 --> 01:11:24.482]  I want to go to Chad.
[01:11:24.482 --> 01:11:31.148]  I want to go to Paul and Mark and Terry and Chris and others.
[01:11:31.148 --> 01:11:33.330]  Let's go ahead and go to Paul in Georgia.
[01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:33.911]  You're on the air.
[01:11:33.911 --> 01:11:34.191]  Welcome.
[01:11:35.851 --> 01:11:37.252]  Hi, listen.
[01:11:37.252 --> 01:11:39.773]  They have violated the rule of law.
[01:11:39.773 --> 01:11:42.034]  They have broken the social contract.
[01:11:42.034 --> 01:11:45.176]  These guys, the criminal class, have no boundaries.
[01:11:45.176 --> 01:11:46.697]  They don't believe in a nation state.
[01:11:46.697 --> 01:11:49.598]  They think they're regulatorily captured.
[01:11:49.598 --> 01:11:55.421]  And they're going to go for broke because they are having a gut check moment in the election.
[01:11:55.421 --> 01:12:01.785]  This primary will be a good post to see where we're at as far as how many people are willing to take action.
[01:12:02.210 --> 01:12:02.630]  I agree.
[01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:03.170]  It's a gauge.
[01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:10.133]  I want you to continue, but for listeners that just tuned in, this is the year we see the veneer, the curtain pulled back.
[01:12:10.133 --> 01:12:12.194]  This is when we find out what's in the closet.
[01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:17.697]  And if we're already under TPP and NAU and EU, global government's being announced by the Pope.
[01:12:18.277 --> 01:12:19.678]  And they're like, look, we took you over.
[01:12:19.678 --> 01:12:21.659]  Yeah, we're going to appoint your presidents now.
[01:12:21.659 --> 01:12:22.820]  We're already doing it in Europe.
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:23.981]  I said that four or five years ago.
[01:12:23.981 --> 01:12:27.983]  They started appointing Goldman Sachs heads to run all these major countries.
[01:12:27.983 --> 01:12:37.129]  They would appoint them as president and order the parliaments to appoint them, not have elections, or they, quote, wouldn't give them more loans of fiat made up money.
[01:12:37.129 --> 01:12:39.471]  When they got away with that in Europe, they said, look,
[01:12:40.331 --> 01:12:43.552]  Americans are just as fat, dumb, and mindless as them.
[01:12:43.552 --> 01:12:44.373]  We're going to do it here.
[01:12:44.373 --> 01:12:48.815]  And now you see both parties doing it as a test in front of everyone.
[01:12:48.815 --> 01:12:49.775]  I totally agree with you.
[01:12:49.775 --> 01:12:51.236]  Go ahead.
[01:12:51.236 --> 01:12:52.296]  Look, we have guns.
[01:12:52.296 --> 01:12:53.476]  That's the bottom line.
[01:12:53.476 --> 01:13:02.960]  But the mind-controlled minions are a lesser class of people than the educated folks that listen to your show and who listen to alternative media who aren't as brainwashed.
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.421]  I think we have an advantage here.
[01:13:04.924 --> 01:13:09.188]  I think that they are going to hide and run when it comes down to it all.
[01:13:09.188 --> 01:13:10.389]  I think we're winning.
[01:13:10.389 --> 01:13:11.830]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:17.115]  I mean, Europe, the globalists, are getting thrown out of England, out of the UK, the Brexit.
[01:13:17.115 --> 01:13:18.236]  Spain is totally upset.
[01:13:18.236 --> 01:13:19.777]  They're having secessions.
[01:13:19.777 --> 01:13:22.880]  Catalonia voted like 80-something percent to leave.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:25.462]  That's their most productive area.
[01:13:25.462 --> 01:13:27.324]  You've got the same thing in Italy.
[01:13:27.324 --> 01:13:28.124]  Listen, you're right.
[01:13:28.124 --> 01:13:29.346]  The world is waking up.
[01:13:30.066 --> 01:13:35.968]  It'll take time, but once the public knows they're under a multinational oligarchy, it's over.
[01:13:35.968 --> 01:13:42.369]  The globalists always wanted to build a corporate world government, have regional systems, but still have puppet leaders in.
[01:13:42.369 --> 01:13:44.090]  But we now know they're puppets.
[01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:56.733]  And the moment we stop looking at the puppet and look above the puppet to the actual puppeteers, it's game over for the new world order.
[01:13:56.733 --> 01:13:57.273]  Collar dropped.
[01:13:57.273 --> 01:13:57.914]  He made his points.
[01:13:57.914 --> 01:13:58.994]  That was a powerful collar.
[01:13:59.755 --> 01:14:03.817]  And by the way, I'm not up here cheerleading saying we're in a good position, we're doing great.
[01:14:03.817 --> 01:14:17.482]  We're in a bad position, the globalists have taken over, but now people are starting to wake up, the pendulum's swinging back the other way, the establishment's trying to suppress everybody and dominate us and break our will, and it's not working.
[01:14:17.482 --> 01:14:21.023]  So we are in a better position, and as time goes on it just gets better.
[01:14:21.023 --> 01:14:24.885]  The problem is they could effectively bring in hardcore
[01:14:26.687 --> 01:14:27.628]  Hot tyrannies.
[01:14:27.628 --> 01:14:33.353]  Not creeping tyrannies, not stealth tyrannies, not velvet glove tyrannies, but the real thing.
[01:14:33.353 --> 01:14:35.475]  And they're miscalculating.
[01:14:35.475 --> 01:14:36.295]  History's clear.
[01:14:36.295 --> 01:14:38.137]  Their own analysts tell them don't do it.
[01:14:38.137 --> 01:14:49.727]  Even the CIA analyst Buck Sexton, who was calling me a conspiracy terrorist on CNN saying, don't listen to Alex Jones, had to go on and say, you steal the election from Trump, it's going to be like a nuclear bomb going off.
[01:14:49.727 --> 01:14:50.428]  Don't do it.
[01:14:51.806 --> 01:15:00.571]  And I happen to know that the CIA and the rest of the people that are plenty corrupt at the top are telling the Republicans and Democrats, man, you need to stop.
[01:15:00.571 --> 01:15:01.892]  We need to indict Hillary.
[01:15:01.892 --> 01:15:03.113]  We need people to be punished.
[01:15:03.113 --> 01:15:05.995]  We need to at least look like we're not totally evil.
[01:15:05.995 --> 01:15:07.936]  We're losing our soft power.
[01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:09.397]  We're losing the info war.
[01:15:09.397 --> 01:15:09.817]  Stop it!
[01:15:11.047 --> 01:15:21.016]  And the lobbyist and the bankers and the George Soros, Soros says, listen, I was rounding people up in 1944 for the Nazis, and I'll get away with it this time too.
[01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:24.179]  You sit down and you shut up full steam ahead.
[01:15:24.179 --> 01:15:26.882]  And he's like, move missiles into Russia, let's have a war.
[01:15:26.882 --> 01:15:29.044]  He's in the news saying, let's have a war with Russia.
[01:15:29.044 --> 01:15:33.668]  We got former generals on Fox News saying, we start killing Russians and having body bags.
[01:15:36.323 --> 01:15:39.624]  There are a lot of crazy people in the power structure.
[01:15:39.624 --> 01:15:42.706]  There's a lot that aren't crazy, by the way.
[01:15:42.706 --> 01:15:45.907]  But you got a bunch of them that are crazy.
[01:15:45.907 --> 01:15:46.547]  They're crazy.
[01:15:46.547 --> 01:15:49.668]  All right, who's been holding the longest?
[01:15:49.668 --> 01:15:56.471]  We're gonna go to Mark, then Terry, then Chad, then Nelson, and others.
[01:15:56.471 --> 01:15:58.112]  Let's go to Mark.
[01:15:58.112 --> 01:16:02.614]  You're on the air from California, former state, now under the control of the North American Union.
[01:16:02.614 --> 01:16:02.854]  Go ahead.
[01:16:04.915 --> 01:16:14.401]  Yeah, I'm thankful you have on Jerome Corsi and Roger Stone and are telling us about how they're stealing the election.
[01:16:14.401 --> 01:16:23.567]  And probably of all your listeners, I tell more people in an average year one-on-one about the show because it is the best.
[01:16:23.567 --> 01:16:30.971]  But I think we have to remember also that the times of the Gentiles ended in 1996.
[01:16:30.971 --> 01:16:33.893]  And that is when the time of the end began, Alex.
[01:16:34.477 --> 01:16:42.354]  Jesus is coming back soon, and I would swear to God on the Holy Bible, on the Holy Bible, that a month before 9-11 happened,
[01:16:44.150 --> 01:16:53.536]  You can, I understood it would be then, based on the prophecy in Daniel Chapter 9 that gives us, you know, 77... Oh, I agree.
[01:16:53.536 --> 01:16:57.378]  When it talks about the rich man seeing the big city collapse, Babylon and all that.
[01:16:57.378 --> 01:16:57.999]  Look, I agree.
[01:16:57.999 --> 01:17:02.602]  We're in biblical, in time type scenarios.
[01:17:02.602 --> 01:17:05.704]  I don't know, because there's many antichrists and many models.
[01:17:05.704 --> 01:17:09.986]  The devil tries to build the same system over and over again towards what he thinks is perfected.
[01:17:09.986 --> 01:17:11.627]  But undoubtedly, with the
[01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:21.673]  Microchips to buy and sell, and they're now announcing DNA chip, where they take your blood, put it in a system to be able to get prescriptions.
[01:17:21.673 --> 01:17:26.876]  That's all doctors and all nurses and all pharmacy people.
[01:17:26.876 --> 01:17:28.958]  Pharmacists are being told it's starting next year.
[01:17:28.958 --> 01:17:36.542]  I covered that a few weeks ago, with all the cashless society stuff happening, with the GMO, with the world government.
[01:17:36.542 --> 01:17:41.005]  I mean, this is all biblical, and it is very, very scary.
[01:17:42.881 --> 01:17:57.688]  Yeah, but what I'm saying, Alex, is, you know, I know he said you don't know the day and hour, but on the other hand, he said, you know, he'd raise the dead on the last day, and the last day of the Sabbath year is coming up, as far as I can tell, around December 1st.
[01:17:57.688 --> 01:18:01.250]  So, you know, I've done a lot of study on this, and
[01:18:01.972 --> 01:18:09.758]  Even though you can't calculate the day and hour of his return, you actually can calculate the precise hour of the so-called... Well, I'll say this.
[01:18:09.758 --> 01:18:10.718]  I sure hope you're right.
[01:18:10.718 --> 01:18:17.003]  I sure wish this would all stop right now and God would come down here and fix this and just show all these evil people, you know, how things really work.
[01:18:17.003 --> 01:18:17.844]  But look...
[01:18:18.664 --> 01:18:27.446]  All I know is the elite are running around, just like Revelation says, hiding in the mountains, hiding in the caves, you know, hiding in their underground fortresses.
[01:18:27.446 --> 01:18:30.006]  They're all stirring and hiding right now.
[01:18:30.006 --> 01:18:34.427]  So what does that sound like to you?
[01:18:34.427 --> 01:18:47.209]  Well, I know that Jesus is going to win in the end, you know, and he's already, I believe, starting to move in a way, because we are at the time of the end.
[01:18:47.896 --> 01:18:54.184]  And I know that if we trust in Christ alone, that we have nothing to fear.
[01:18:54.184 --> 01:19:02.775]  Absolutely, and that's why I really do not fear the New World Order, because I have a personal relationship with Christ and God, and I know God's real.
[01:19:02.775 --> 01:19:05.538]  And it's humbling to be able to feel God's presence.
[01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:10.171]  I'm very sad for people that don't have that connection to God.
[01:19:10.171 --> 01:19:15.293]  And it doesn't mean, again, that I'm on a high horse, folks, or I've got all the answers.
[01:19:15.293 --> 01:19:18.715]  I know how wicked my flesh is, but I do have a relationship with God.
[01:19:18.715 --> 01:19:20.056]  I appreciate your call, Mark.
[01:19:20.056 --> 01:19:23.698]  Very good points you make.
[01:19:23.698 --> 01:19:29.882]  It's out of Proverbs 28, the wicked flee when no man pursue, but the righteous are bold as a lion.
[01:19:31.647 --> 01:19:32.928]  That's what it comes down to.
[01:19:32.928 --> 01:19:37.831]  And so, you know, the scurrying into their bunkers could just be the Wicked Fleet when none pursued.
[01:19:37.831 --> 01:19:43.375]  Panicked elite buying bomb-proof luxury survival bunkers to escape civil unrest and disasters.
[01:19:43.375 --> 01:19:47.438]  The video's up on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:19:47.438 --> 01:19:49.099]  We just tweeted it out again at RealAlexJones.
[01:19:49.099 --> 01:19:50.961]  You want to help us retweet that?
[01:19:50.961 --> 01:19:54.323]  And, of course, on the left-hand side of DrugsReport.com right now.
[01:19:54.323 --> 01:19:57.745]  We're going to come back with more of your calls, Chad and others.
[01:19:57.745 --> 01:19:58.266]  Stay with us.
[01:20:02.157 --> 01:20:04.941]  December 7th, 1941.
[01:20:04.941 --> 01:20:09.327]  A date which will live in infamy.
[01:20:09.327 --> 01:20:14.534]  75 years ago, America suffered one of the worst moments in American history.
[01:20:14.534 --> 01:20:16.196]  The attack on Pearl Harbor.
[01:20:16.937 --> 01:20:27.963]  Now you can remember December 7th, 1941 with the purchase of the first ever 75th Anniversary Pearl Harbor Legal Tender Solid Gold Coin from the U.S.
[01:20:27.963 --> 01:20:29.064]  Money Reserve.

[01:20:58.621 --> 01:21:02.843]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:21:02.843 --> 01:21:03.463]  It's true.
[01:21:03.463 --> 01:21:07.624]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:21:07.624 --> 01:21:10.005]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:21:10.005 --> 01:21:14.487]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:21:14.787 --> 01:21:27.686]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.
[01:21:27.686 --> 01:21:31.191]  Big Berkey Water Filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[01:21:31.471 --> 01:21:34.112]  The gold standard in water purification.

[01:21:38.453 --> 01:21:39.273]  Big Berkey.
[01:21:39.273 --> 01:21:42.974]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[01:21:42.974 --> 01:21:44.735]  Get your Big Berkey today.

[01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:47.855]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:21:47.855 --> 01:21:49.276]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[01:21:49.276 --> 01:21:50.556]  For the love of clean water.
[01:21:58.624 --> 01:22:02.989]  Biochemistry determines your mood, memory, energy, and endurance.
[01:22:02.989 --> 01:22:06.012]  Your body's primary metabolic function is to make protein.
[01:22:06.012 --> 01:22:08.955]  One World Whey is a unique, non-denatured protein.
[01:22:08.955 --> 01:22:14.200]  This enables your body to have virtually 100% utilization, whereas typical whey protein powders offer
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:17.323]  No more than 18% utilization of protein.
[01:22:17.323 --> 01:22:20.445]  One World Way also delivers life-giving frequencies to your cells.
[01:22:20.445 --> 01:22:25.990]  The net result for so many people is improved energy, mood, and elimination of pain from inflammation.
[01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:29.854]  This technologically enhanced One World Way has been really amazing.
[01:22:30.454 --> 01:22:37.057]  I'm 36 years old, and for the past several years, I've been struggling with lack of energy, drive, and stamina.
[01:22:37.057 --> 01:22:40.879]  And after just two weeks on this product, I'm feeling so much more energy.
[01:22:40.879 --> 01:22:47.162]  My yoga practice has deepened, and as a massage therapist, I'm able to see more clients than I've been able to in years.
[01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:50.303]  I've never felt results that quick with anything I've ever taken.
[01:22:50.303 --> 01:22:52.525]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[01:22:52.525 --> 01:22:54.886]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[01:22:58.539 --> 01:23:00.861]  Are you concerned about the Power Grid?
[01:23:00.861 --> 01:23:03.284]  About the new war on the Power Grid?
[01:23:03.284 --> 01:23:08.849]  If so, this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear, and the most valuable.
[01:23:08.849 --> 01:23:09.850]  Here's why.
[01:23:09.850 --> 01:23:15.396]  An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the Power Grid has just been written.
[01:23:15.396 --> 01:23:19.280]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies.
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:22.822]  But only for a limited time to GCN listeners.
[01:23:22.822 --> 01:23:27.524]  He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[01:23:27.524 --> 01:23:33.286]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book to you.
[01:23:33.286 --> 01:23:34.247]  Why do this?
[01:23:34.247 --> 01:23:38.108]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[01:23:38.108 --> 01:23:39.129]  The answer is simple.
[01:23:39.389 --> 01:23:43.552]  America's power grid is in grave danger, and most Americans are clueless.
[01:23:43.552 --> 01:23:50.417]  Find out what's going on behind the scenes, and why the most common question this author gets is, do you fear for your life?
[01:23:50.417 --> 01:23:52.719]  Go to waronthegrid.com.
[01:23:52.719 --> 01:23:54.820]  That's waronthegrid.com.
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:55.441]  Don't wait.
[01:23:55.441 --> 01:23:57.162]  waronthegrid.com.
[01:24:08.111 --> 01:24:26.134]  They're actually in the news and on Glenn Beck all over saying, your vote never counted on CNBC, Fox News, you know, they're like, Trump that sore loser says that people should vote for him.
[01:24:26.134 --> 01:24:27.195]  I mean, what a sore loser.
[01:24:27.195 --> 01:24:28.095]  Can you believe that?
[01:24:28.095 --> 01:24:31.635]  He thinks people used to vote in America?
[01:24:31.635 --> 01:24:34.896]  What are these conspiracy theorists going to come up with next?
[01:24:37.987 --> 01:24:39.648]  I don't know, the sky's blue, maybe?
[01:24:39.648 --> 01:24:41.290]  I don't know.
[01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:43.411]  Alex Jones here, back live at InfoWars.com.
[01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:46.954]  Let's go to Terry, then we're going to go to Chad and others.
[01:24:46.954 --> 01:24:49.676]  Terry in Minnesota, thanks for calling today.
[01:24:49.676 --> 01:24:52.438]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:24:52.438 --> 01:24:54.680]  Hello Alex, how are you doing today?
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:58.143]  I'm just watching stuff happen that I never thought would get this crazy this fast.
[01:24:58.143 --> 01:25:00.024]  What do you think?
[01:25:00.024 --> 01:25:00.985]  Well, here's what I think.
[01:25:00.985 --> 01:25:07.670]  I've talked to you multiple times in my young InfoWars career, about two months, and that last call you had basically is dead on.
[01:25:08.525 --> 01:25:12.946]  Um, you know, everything has been laid out in that book, the Bible.
[01:25:12.946 --> 01:25:17.427]  I mean, you want to know what happened to Atlantis and the rest of the cities in the first earth age?
[01:25:17.427 --> 01:25:20.227]  Um, you know, you want to know where Russia's coming against us from?
[01:25:20.227 --> 01:25:21.768]  It's in the scriptures.
[01:25:21.768 --> 01:25:23.248]  Um, you're of the house of Israel.
[01:25:23.248 --> 01:25:24.648]  You don't even know it.
[01:25:24.648 --> 01:25:26.109]  Um, you know, things like this.
[01:25:26.109 --> 01:25:32.070]  I beg for instance, is, um, you know, uh, you know, military wounded combat veteran.
[01:25:32.697 --> 01:25:37.921]  You know, there's thousands of combat and non-combat veterans that study with the Shepherd's Chapel.
[01:25:37.921 --> 01:25:43.426]  We have 7, 8, 9, and 10-year-olds that understand the Book of Revelation, because like I said, I think I talked to you like a couple times.
[01:25:43.426 --> 01:25:45.687]  I even talked to... No, I understand.
[01:25:45.687 --> 01:25:47.589]  You're saying it's that situation.
[01:25:47.589 --> 01:25:50.611]  What's your take on the election?
[01:25:50.611 --> 01:25:51.292]  I told you.
[01:25:51.292 --> 01:25:55.515]  My first thought, I said, Trump's going to make it in, because here it is.
[01:25:55.515 --> 01:25:57.897]  Seven seals, seven vials, seven Trumps.
[01:25:57.897 --> 01:26:00.179]  God is using everything he can to wake up his children.
[01:26:00.179 --> 01:26:01.360]  What is Trump's last name?
[01:26:02.501 --> 01:26:08.064]  I mean, there are so many clues like that last caller.
[01:26:08.064 --> 01:26:09.805]  He's absolutely correct.
[01:26:09.805 --> 01:26:12.847]  And at Shepherd's Chapel, we don't give you dates.
[01:26:13.243 --> 01:26:17.984]  We go by, like, say, the parable of the fig tree, which sets up the last generation, you know, 1948.
[01:26:17.984 --> 01:26:23.125]  Sure, Harry, I'm going to jump to others because you called a few weeks ago and said basically the same thing, but I hear what you're saying.
[01:26:23.125 --> 01:26:27.686]  It's, look, they're coming out with world government microchips to buy and sell.
[01:26:27.686 --> 01:26:37.927]  They're saying no cash will be allowed, forced medical control, a world government, a one world religion, ten regions with three mega regions over them.
[01:26:37.927 --> 01:26:41.748]  Either the Bible's real or they're using it as a template of control.
[01:26:42.762 --> 01:26:45.843]  Like, oh, this is good science fiction, let's do this.
[01:26:45.843 --> 01:26:52.366]  And I'm not doubting the Bible myself, I'm just saying, whether it's real or not, it's being manifest.
[01:26:52.366 --> 01:26:59.029]  Like, Jules Verne, 150 years ago, wrote about spaceships to the moon, now it's happened.
[01:26:59.029 --> 01:27:03.111]  You know, 70, 80 years after he wrote about it.
[01:27:03.111 --> 01:27:06.713]  Humans are able to build what we imagine.
[01:27:06.713 --> 01:27:07.513]  And it's happening.
[01:27:08.683 --> 01:27:10.163]  Look, let's say you're an atheist.
[01:27:10.163 --> 01:27:18.106]  You should be against the cashless society because it tracks you, it traces you, it controls you, it runs your life.
[01:27:18.106 --> 01:27:22.787]  But you'll say, oh, I'm all for it because, you know, those dumb Christians are scared of it.
[01:27:22.787 --> 01:27:27.688]  You'll just adopt whatever because you think it's cool.
[01:27:27.688 --> 01:27:30.349]  And I'm not saying all atheists are like that, but I do see that happening.
[01:27:31.843 --> 01:27:38.944]  Driverless cars, cell phones, all of it with back doors to control your life, to game the system, to run your life.
[01:27:38.944 --> 01:27:43.806]  And now the feds came out two days ago and said, yeah, we want to have driverless cars within 10 years.
[01:27:43.806 --> 01:27:44.786]  It'll save lives.
[01:27:44.786 --> 01:27:47.106]  Our goal is to get humans out of cars.
[01:27:47.106 --> 01:27:48.586]  I'd talk about that 15 years ago.
[01:27:48.586 --> 01:27:49.527]  People laughed at me.
[01:27:49.527 --> 01:27:55.048]  They're already starting federal test cases to tax you by the mile.
[01:27:55.048 --> 01:27:55.448]  It's here.
[01:27:56.789 --> 01:28:04.730]  And it's taking control of our lives away from us into automated systems run by the, what does Davos call their new system?
[01:28:04.730 --> 01:28:06.551]  A technocracy.
[01:28:06.551 --> 01:28:11.712]  A dictatorship of a technological elite.
[01:28:11.712 --> 01:28:15.052]  And I think you're so dumb, they'll go, we're not for global government.
[01:28:15.052 --> 01:28:19.973]  We're for global governance.
[01:28:19.973 --> 01:28:24.034]  And yes, we want a technocratic system.
[01:28:24.034 --> 01:28:25.954]  It's going to be called the technotronic era.
[01:28:27.162 --> 01:28:29.904]  They've been saying that since the 70s.
[01:28:29.904 --> 01:28:33.287]  In books like The Technotronic Era of Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[01:28:33.287 --> 01:28:34.928]  National Security Advisor at the time.
[01:28:34.928 --> 01:28:36.449]  That plan was adopted.
[01:28:36.449 --> 01:28:37.971]  We're on this grand plan.
[01:28:37.971 --> 01:28:38.931]  They're building it.
[01:28:38.931 --> 01:28:40.092]  We know the plan.
[01:28:40.092 --> 01:28:41.193]  They're rolling it out.
[01:28:41.193 --> 01:28:44.115]  We can stop it.
[01:28:44.115 --> 01:28:45.196]  More of your calls coming up.
[01:28:45.196 --> 01:28:46.898]  Stuart Rhoades is about to join us.
[01:28:48.646 --> 01:28:57.129]  We have an amazing nootropic that really we set out to have the highest quality natural brain boost product out there for the lowest price.
[01:28:57.129 --> 01:29:02.671]  There are brands out there that are similar formulations that are double the price.
[01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:08.013]  This is super high quality, nutraceutical, and it's normally
[01:29:10.582 --> 01:29:11.542]  $35 or more.
[01:29:11.542 --> 01:29:15.205]  It is $22.46 right now.
[01:29:15.205 --> 01:29:18.468]  The savings is $17.49.
[01:29:18.468 --> 01:29:22.271]  By the way, the promo we have is 25% off Rainforest.
[01:29:22.271 --> 01:29:25.234]  No, no, that's 25% off the already discounted amount.
[01:29:25.234 --> 01:29:29.157]  We should redo the banners and redo this because I'm looking at the numbers.
[01:29:29.157 --> 01:29:30.838]  Off retail, it's 25% off sale price.
[01:29:34.218 --> 01:29:36.179]  So, it's even better than I was saying.
[01:29:36.179 --> 01:29:38.280]  Supplies will not last long, though.
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:39.060]  Get your Brain Force.
[01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:39.820]  Try it out today.
[01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:40.921]  It really is amazing.
[01:29:40.921 --> 01:29:43.822]  Several of the ingredients are in our prescription.
[01:29:43.822 --> 01:29:44.562]  In Europe.
[01:29:44.562 --> 01:29:45.243]  Brain Force.
[01:29:45.243 --> 01:29:45.743]  Check it out.
[01:29:45.743 --> 01:29:46.583]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:29:46.583 --> 01:29:48.324]  Stay with us.
[01:29:48.324 --> 01:29:49.725]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.725 --> 01:29:52.246]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.246 --> 01:29:54.927]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.016 --> 01:30:03.058]  Uber admits it gave data on 12 million users to U.S.
[01:30:03.058 --> 01:30:03.478]  government.
[01:30:03.478 --> 01:30:08.480]  Ridesharing company admits to complying with roughly 85% of requests from law enforcement.
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:11.221]  Article up by Mikael Thelen at InfoWars.com.
[01:30:11.221 --> 01:30:14.482]  Now according to the company's first ever transparency report, both U.S.
[01:30:14.482 --> 01:30:20.804]  law enforcement and regulators were provided with information on millions of users between July and December of 2015.
[01:30:20.804 --> 01:30:24.946]  We received requests from law enforcement agencies for information about our riders.
[01:30:25.126 --> 01:30:35.689]  Requests from law enforcement agencies at both the state and federal level included information on everything from pickup and drop-off locations to the identity of specific drivers and passengers.
[01:30:35.689 --> 01:30:43.532]  None of the inquiries are believed to be related to national security since Uber did not receive any requests issued under the provisions of national security statutes.
[01:30:43.692 --> 01:30:50.121]  But in many cases, they send blanket requests explaining why the information is needed or how it will be used, Uber wrote.
[01:30:50.121 --> 01:30:55.368]  And while this kind of tripped out it doesn't include personal information, it can reveal patterns or behavior.
[01:30:55.368 --> 01:30:58.452]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[01:30:59.012 --> 01:31:02.975]  Secret 12, InfoWars Life's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:31:02.975 --> 01:31:09.280]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:16.265]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:31:16.565 --> 01:31:25.697]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[01:31:25.697 --> 01:31:31.865]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:31:31.865 --> 01:31:35.009]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections and
[01:31:35.249 --> 01:31:36.049]  We're good to go.
[01:31:58.615 --> 01:31:59.455]  Hey, everyone!
[01:31:59.455 --> 01:32:01.736]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:32:01.736 --> 01:32:05.577]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:32:05.577 --> 01:32:07.657]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:32:07.657 --> 01:32:17.940]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:23.901]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:32:24.321 --> 01:32:24.742]  We're good to go.
[01:32:39.258 --> 01:32:39.738]  I think so.
[01:33:07.276 --> 01:33:10.826]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:10.826 --> 01:33:14.977]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:29.384 --> 01:33:32.345]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:32.345 --> 01:33:32.885]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:32.885 --> 01:33:34.806]  We're here live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:34.806 --> 01:33:36.606]  More your calls coming up.
[01:33:36.606 --> 01:33:37.866]  Our stories linked on Drudge.
[01:33:37.866 --> 01:33:43.508]  Panicked elite buying bomb-proof luxury survival bunkers to escape civil unrest disasters.
[01:33:43.508 --> 01:33:45.769]  And I love how they advertise where they are in the U.S.
[01:33:45.769 --> 01:33:47.469]  and Germany and other areas.
[01:33:47.469 --> 01:33:51.870]  As if if things collapse people won't go there and dump chlorine gas down the
[01:33:54.011 --> 01:33:56.132]  Down the breathing nozzles.
[01:33:56.132 --> 01:34:03.095]  I mean, it's just ridiculous how these establishment people think they're going to escape what they've set up and what they've established.
[01:34:03.095 --> 01:34:11.138]  They think they're going to stage civil wars in this country over class war, us against the police, race war.
[01:34:11.138 --> 01:34:15.640]  That's not going to happen if we get the word out and expose what the new world order is up to.
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:16.600]  And I am so proud
[01:34:18.382 --> 01:34:21.605]  To be able to promote a film that I know has been like three years in the making.
[01:34:21.605 --> 01:34:25.489]  Because he interviewed me like three years ago, then two years ago, then like a year ago.
[01:34:25.489 --> 01:34:29.753]  Chuck Andersey is going to be joining us towards the end of the third hour today.
[01:34:29.753 --> 01:34:34.417]  The film is going to be showing in select theaters around Texas this weekend.
[01:34:34.417 --> 01:34:37.380]  And if those sell out, we're going to tell you how to go there today.
[01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:40.223]  RevelationTheMovie.info.
[01:34:40.223 --> 01:34:42.265]  RevelationTheMovie.info.
[01:34:43.641 --> 01:34:46.563]  Then other theaters will decide to just pick it up.
[01:34:46.563 --> 01:34:48.485]  That's how so many films become very popular.
[01:34:48.485 --> 01:34:53.148]  But regardless, it'll be out on DVD and out on Blu-ray and things like that in the future.
[01:34:53.148 --> 01:35:00.893]  It's mainly hosted and basically narrated by Charlie Daniels, country music legend.
[01:35:00.893 --> 01:35:04.216]  It's also got General Boykin, former head of Special Forces.
[01:35:04.216 --> 01:35:06.637]  And it's Stuart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers.
[01:35:06.637 --> 01:35:11.261]  It's got amazing interviews with the Motor City madman Ted Nugent.
[01:35:11.921 --> 01:35:18.604]  Myself, I play a prominent role in the film, so I'm very excited to be able to promote this documentary.
[01:35:18.604 --> 01:35:27.427]  We also have a gentleman coming on who's a Sunni Muslim in the heart of the Middle East and was part of the Muslim Brotherhood and their operations.
[01:35:27.427 --> 01:35:33.009]  He's in the film exposing what the radical Jihad invasion is about and so much more.
[01:35:34.153 --> 01:35:40.018]  I also have several clips from the film that we're going to be premiering here today.
[01:35:40.018 --> 01:35:41.920]  The trailers have been out for a few weeks.
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:43.701]  We've premiered some of those.
[01:35:43.701 --> 01:35:45.183]  Those are up on Infowars.com.
[01:35:45.183 --> 01:35:51.809]  You can see all the trailers and more again by going to the website revelationthemovie.info.
[01:35:51.809 --> 01:35:54.511]  That's revelationthemovie.info.
[01:35:54.511 --> 01:35:59.876]  We're going to premiere some sneak peeks here of General Boykin, Charlie Daniels,
[01:36:00.656 --> 01:36:02.217]  Myself and others.
[01:36:02.217 --> 01:36:05.859]  We also have a video that's an audience screener reaction.
[01:36:05.859 --> 01:36:12.063]  Ron Paul was down in Houston this weekend and saw a screening and had a lot of good things to say about it as well.
[01:36:12.063 --> 01:36:13.984]  Ron Paul's in the film as well.
[01:36:13.984 --> 01:36:16.045]  And again, will this film save the world or save the country?
[01:36:16.045 --> 01:36:16.826]  No.
[01:36:16.826 --> 01:36:24.230]  But they want to shut down our free speech and our information because together it will defeat the globalists.
[01:36:24.230 --> 01:36:26.011]  Congress has a 9% approval rating.
[01:36:27.424 --> 01:36:28.685]  The establishment is in trouble.
[01:36:28.685 --> 01:36:32.268]  They're having to openly steal the election from Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.
[01:36:32.268 --> 01:36:33.589]  You may not like either one of them.
[01:36:33.589 --> 01:36:34.730]  I hate Sanders.
[01:36:34.730 --> 01:36:36.031]  Have some problems with Trump.
[01:36:36.031 --> 01:36:39.254]  But the establishment's scared because they're not controlled by them.
[01:36:39.254 --> 01:36:41.876]  So they're having to be very naked now about their theft.
[01:36:41.876 --> 01:36:45.419]  And somebody who's been a veteran and also of course worked many years in Ron Paul's
[01:36:46.698 --> 01:36:59.525]  Offices and then HELP found a great organization that so many of you know that's been demonized because it tries to get the military and police to be educated and to reaffirm their oath to be Oath Keepers and not be part of a martial law takeover.
[01:36:59.525 --> 01:37:03.808]  Now when Rhodes started getting involved in this many years ago, there was a lot of eye rolling.
[01:37:03.808 --> 01:37:08.671]  There isn't eye rolling at OathKeepers.org right now because it's out in the open!
[01:37:09.887 --> 01:37:11.989]  MSNBC wants the Tea Party arrested.
[01:37:11.989 --> 01:37:14.412]  They want the Christian churches shut down.
[01:37:14.412 --> 01:37:17.675]  They want the government to take our freedoms.
[01:37:17.675 --> 01:37:22.200]  They want to indict Joel Gilbert because he put a film out about Obama.
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:23.982]  They say that's a violation of election rules.
[01:37:23.982 --> 01:37:26.104]  They arrested Dinesh D'Souza.
[01:37:26.104 --> 01:37:28.346]  There's political persecution going on.
[01:37:29.207 --> 01:37:36.909]  With the anti-Tea Party people going around slapping folks, beating them up, attacking Trump supporters all over the country.
[01:37:36.909 --> 01:37:38.869]  This is the new safe space.
[01:37:38.869 --> 01:37:47.371]  And Stuart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers, joins us to talk about the film, but also where he sees the state of the world right now.
[01:37:47.371 --> 01:37:50.032]  Stuart, great to have you joining us via Skype.
[01:37:50.032 --> 01:37:50.492]  Likewise.
[01:37:50.492 --> 01:37:51.592]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:37:51.592 --> 01:37:52.072]  Well, go ahead.
[01:37:52.072 --> 01:37:53.132]  We've got about 20-30 minutes here.
[01:37:53.132 --> 01:37:54.353]  I know you've got a lot to say.
[01:37:54.353 --> 01:37:55.053]  Where should we start?
[01:37:56.135 --> 01:37:57.736]  Well, what you just said is accurate.
[01:37:57.736 --> 01:38:01.498]  The mask is starting to come off, and it's very clear now to the American people.
[01:38:01.498 --> 01:38:09.382]  I mean, us Ron Paulers saw it in 2008 and 2012, the corruption inside the GOP, and it's the same way inside the Democratic Party.
[01:38:09.382 --> 01:38:11.023]  But now everyone's starting to see it.
[01:38:11.023 --> 01:38:16.226]  Mainstream, rank-and-file Republicans who support Trump are starting to see it themselves.
[01:38:16.226 --> 01:38:17.047]  Look at Colorado.
[01:38:17.047 --> 01:38:18.027]  It was very blatant.
[01:38:18.027 --> 01:38:19.228]  They weren't even allowed to vote.
[01:38:19.668 --> 01:38:21.149]  So, I think it's good.
[01:38:21.149 --> 01:38:32.193]  As you said, the elites are back against the wall, they're trying to corral the vote and corral the system as they always have been doing, but now they have to do it much more openly.
[01:38:32.193 --> 01:38:34.634]  And what you said about the college campuses is the same thing.
[01:38:34.634 --> 01:38:42.697]  I could see it when I was a student at Yale Law School, when I was a student before that at UNLV, the kind of political correctness on the campus, it's now right in your face.
[01:38:42.697 --> 01:38:46.099]  It's right there with the common stars trying to enforce it by force.
[01:38:46.559 --> 01:38:50.441]  Which is one of the reasons why we're going to be on college campuses this year.
[01:38:50.441 --> 01:38:57.024]  We're starting student chapters on college campuses across the country for that very reason.
[01:38:57.024 --> 01:39:09.349]  Anybody can go to Google and type in Chinese Youth Brigades, Communist Chinese Red Guard, and see them beating fellow students' brains out with aluminum chairs and burning them at the stake.
[01:39:09.349 --> 01:39:14.452]  Millions were killed by the Youth Brigades, and when I'm here in Austin in an abortion clinic or we're at a university,
[01:39:15.734 --> 01:39:18.575]  They identify as Maoist to a person.
[01:39:18.575 --> 01:39:22.217]  And they come and say, when we're taking over, we're going to kill you soon.
[01:39:22.217 --> 01:39:23.438]  We have it on video.
[01:39:23.438 --> 01:39:24.979]  And then they say it's our time.
[01:39:24.979 --> 01:39:27.120]  And suddenly, red flags are everywhere.
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:30.221]  I guess this was breeding under the surface.
[01:39:30.221 --> 01:39:31.102]  What do you make of that?
[01:39:32.366 --> 01:39:34.348]  Well, they're just finally showing their true colors.
[01:39:34.348 --> 01:39:36.211]  I saw it, like I said, at Yale Law School.
[01:39:36.211 --> 01:39:40.336]  They're proud Maoists, proud Leninists there.
[01:39:40.336 --> 01:39:43.560]  And so now they're starting to take the mask off and show what they really are.
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:46.063]  But this is not China, this is not Russia.
[01:39:46.063 --> 01:39:47.504]  So they're going to be seeing us.
[01:39:47.504 --> 01:39:48.305]  So we'll be there too.
[01:39:49.166 --> 01:39:57.633]  Veterans in this country, patriotic Americans, are not going to let them take over the college campuses and use violence and force, as they already have tried to do.
[01:39:57.633 --> 01:39:58.634]  It's not going to happen.
[01:39:58.634 --> 01:40:05.259]  Look at the bikers who responded to the violence of the Trump rallies by saying they're going to go there and protect free speech.
[01:40:05.259 --> 01:40:07.221]  I mean, like you, I have a lot of problems with Trump.
[01:40:07.221 --> 01:40:08.842]  I disagree with him on a lot of things.
[01:40:08.842 --> 01:40:12.245]  But the point is, is that you can't shut down free speech in this country.
[01:40:12.245 --> 01:40:14.407]  Once you shut down free speech, then it's time to fight.
[01:40:16.224 --> 01:40:20.028]  I know you've got a lot of points, articles that are powerful, videos every day on OathKeepers.org.
[01:40:20.028 --> 01:40:23.010]  And I kind of want you to get a report about the state of the military and the police.
[01:40:23.010 --> 01:40:27.394]  Nobody has more contact with them from a constitutional perspective than probably somebody like you.
[01:40:27.394 --> 01:40:28.595]  I have a lot of contact as well.
[01:40:28.595 --> 01:40:31.258]  They are on fire right now, waking up.
[01:40:31.258 --> 01:40:33.640]  And we know they really said no during Katrina gun confiscation.
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:35.922]  The media lied and said they went ahead with it.
[01:40:35.922 --> 01:40:38.704]  But, you know, that's just an example of what's been happening that we're not told about.
[01:40:38.704 --> 01:40:42.108]  And I want to go to the film, obviously, here with you as well today.
[01:40:43.706 --> 01:40:56.783]  Looking at their attempts to ban free speech on colleges, I think it shows their weakness and their attempt to try to bully us that they brought out earlier than they wanted to the fact that they're really total totalitarians.
[01:40:58.407 --> 01:40:58.968]  Well, sure.
[01:40:58.968 --> 01:41:07.417]  It's a mixture of hubris on their part, and believing that they have it all locked up, and also their desperation, I think.
[01:41:07.417 --> 01:41:13.885]  So, you know, they want to sandwich through and push through their agenda, and they think the American people can be cowed with fear.
[01:41:13.885 --> 01:41:14.946]  And it's just not the fact.
[01:41:14.946 --> 01:41:15.807]  It's just not going to happen.
[01:41:16.127 --> 01:41:16.988]  They live in a bubble.
[01:41:16.988 --> 01:41:19.490]  You know, inside New York City, that flies.
[01:41:19.490 --> 01:41:23.334]  Out here in Montana, or someplace out west, this is not going to fly at all.
[01:41:23.334 --> 01:41:31.522]  So, they might be able to get away with it in Columbia, but it's not going to happen, you know, at any place that you have veterans returning from combat going to college.
[01:41:31.522 --> 01:41:32.462]  They're going to get stomped.
[01:41:32.462 --> 01:41:33.543]  That's what's going to happen to them.
[01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:43.819]  So, in fact, I know a lot of veterans, the first time they see some radical leftist trampling on a flag or burning a flag, they're going to kick their ass.
[01:41:43.819 --> 01:41:48.303]  And I know you can say, well, it's free speech, but the veteran doesn't care about that.
[01:41:48.303 --> 01:41:53.208]  In his mind, it's not free speech, that's not protected speech, it's incitement to violence.
[01:41:53.208 --> 01:41:54.589]  So he's going to go ahead and use it.
[01:41:56.494 --> 01:41:59.938]  Especially because they've been attacking women and children and others.
[01:41:59.938 --> 01:42:02.941]  I notice these communists always attack people in wheelchairs and stuff.
[01:42:02.941 --> 01:42:06.485]  They don't really do it in areas where there's men or women that will stand up around.
[01:42:06.485 --> 01:42:12.331]  What is the sense right now of the military and police contacts that Oath Keepers is talking to?
[01:42:14.403 --> 01:42:25.354]  That they really have no sympathy for whether it's a Black Lives Matter protester or a radical Bernie supporter, you know, anti-Trump person.
[01:42:25.354 --> 01:42:29.959]  We're just tired of them being in our face calling us racist because we disagree with their political agenda.
[01:42:30.419 --> 01:42:33.261]  And I think the rank-and-file military and police have the same feeling.
[01:42:33.261 --> 01:42:34.622]  They're sick of it.
[01:42:34.622 --> 01:42:36.563]  And so they have no sympathy for them.
[01:42:36.563 --> 01:42:42.086]  So we have to guard against, of course, guard against our side trampling free speech and crossing the line.
[01:42:42.086 --> 01:42:51.471]  But when someone gets in your face and wants to use violence, like that one, that one, uh, you know, commissar who was screaming and screeching for muscles, like, you know, bring some muscle over here!
[01:42:51.471 --> 01:42:52.072]  I need muscle!
[01:42:52.452 --> 01:42:54.674]  People like that, we have no sympathy for.
[01:42:54.674 --> 01:42:59.718]  So when she gets what's coming to her, and those like her, well... Well, exactly.
[01:42:59.718 --> 01:43:03.902]  A bunch of people run up to attack you because you're at the college, you're a member of the college, you're at the park.
[01:43:03.902 --> 01:43:09.227]  They say it's all theirs, they try to physically assault you, and then it's time to defend yourself.
[01:43:09.227 --> 01:43:10.368]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:43:10.368 --> 01:43:18.414]  And when someone does defend themselves and they get stomped, of course they'll screech and call them racist and fascist and brown shirts, but they brought it on themselves.
[01:43:18.414 --> 01:43:19.896]  And so I just have no sympathy for them.
[01:43:20.356 --> 01:43:24.858]  You know, now, if they're going to go out and use free speech, then that's fine.
[01:43:24.858 --> 01:43:26.839]  We'll defend their right to free speech, too.
[01:43:26.839 --> 01:43:30.641]  But as soon as they want to cross the line of violence, well, we're their Huffleberry, so it's okay.
[01:43:30.641 --> 01:43:31.542]  We can do that, too.
[01:43:31.542 --> 01:43:48.491]  Stewart, what is your sense, with your contacts in government and out, on where this country's going currently, as you call it, the battle space here in the Republic, but also what's happening in Europe, what Obama is doing, the opening the borders outside of law, flaunting everything.
[01:43:50.134 --> 01:43:57.880]  I mean, is this the death of America, or is this the death throes of the establishment trying to wound the nation however they can on their way out?
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:43:58.941]  Where do you think we are currently?
[01:43:59.858 --> 01:44:01.699]  Well, I think you've said so yourself.
[01:44:01.699 --> 01:44:06.560]  It's a two-way window in past conversations we've had over the years.
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:10.122]  Chaos, they want to use creative chaos to create their future.
[01:44:10.122 --> 01:44:17.945]  We understand that they're doing a full spectrum, fourth-generation warfare assault on this country, just as they're doing on Europe.
[01:44:17.945 --> 01:44:19.925]  It's an assault on Western civilization.
[01:44:19.925 --> 01:44:24.427]  The wide-open borders in Europe, the obvious, you know, Tattoo, as Matt Bracken calls it,
[01:44:24.767 --> 01:44:25.828]  I think he's right.
[01:44:25.828 --> 01:44:36.300]  They're intentionally leaving the borders open in Europe, bringing in mass refugees, among them are going to be jihadists, who are setting up a future Tet Offensive, Tet-style offensive in Europe.
[01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:38.122]  And the same thing is being done to this country.
[01:44:38.122 --> 01:44:43.588]  So, if we just sit back, they'll win, because they'll cause the chaos that they'll use as creative destruction.
[01:44:43.948 --> 01:44:49.672]  Now, if we're ready to push through our agenda, which is liberty, during that time of chaos, then we will win.
[01:44:49.672 --> 01:45:03.281]  That's why it's incredibly important for us to make sure that we get together with fellow veterans and fellow constitutionalists in our communities and form up those, we call them community preparedness teams, however you want to call them, civil defense units, whatever.
[01:45:03.281 --> 01:45:12.508]  Make sure that you have the ability inside your local community to preserve liberty, life, liberty, and property when the time comes, and fight in the street against their
[01:45:13.248 --> 01:45:24.176]  They're fourth generation warfare agents, which are going to be the jihadists, and the cartels, and the gangs, and these radical Black Lives Matter people, and the black anarchists, the black flag anarchists.
[01:45:24.176 --> 01:45:25.056]  It's all the same thing.
[01:45:25.056 --> 01:45:29.800]  They're all just force multipliers and proxies, just as we saw during the Cold War with communism.
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:31.642]  So it's the same agenda.
[01:45:31.642 --> 01:45:40.712]  We have to make sure that we provide the liberty version, the liberty outcome, instead of people going from the frying pan into the fire, of thinking the only way to stop the copyright.
[01:45:40.712 --> 01:45:41.032]  That's right.
[01:45:41.032 --> 01:45:48.281]  Just as George Washington ended up winning the propaganda war because his troops had much higher standards than the redcoats, we have to be absolutely above reproach.
[01:45:48.661 --> 01:45:49.621]  What do we do about things?
[01:45:49.621 --> 01:45:51.062]  We have a mole inside the Democrats.
[01:45:51.062 --> 01:45:52.602]  I'm just going to leave it at their high level.
[01:45:52.602 --> 01:46:00.565]  They are getting InfoWars t-shirts when my guy's going to New York tomorrow and to Portland this weekend to come dress as InfoWarriors to commit crimes.
[01:46:00.565 --> 01:46:04.226]  I guess we just identify them, videotape it, and have their false flag blow up in their face?
[01:46:04.226 --> 01:46:07.407]  I mean, what else do we do, Stuart, to that type of fourth-generation false flag?
[01:46:08.183 --> 01:46:17.670]  That's all you can do and it has to be done on both sides because both Hillary Clinton and you can look at Cruz or the other GOP anointed, they're both, you know, pre-selected.
[01:46:17.670 --> 01:46:18.351]  We all know this.
[01:46:18.351 --> 01:46:26.317]  This is what's becoming very clear to the rest of the American people now is that the GOP and the Democrat Party are one in the same and they pre-select your false choice.
[01:46:27.257 --> 01:46:28.398]  So that's what we're seeing now.
[01:46:28.398 --> 01:46:33.640]  So I think it's good to see what's happening to the Trump supporters and to the Bernie supporters.
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:44.406]  As you said, I think Bernie Sanders is, at least as an honest communist, he's an outright communist, but you're starting to see that the manipulation of the system is becoming much more apparent to the American people.
[01:46:44.406 --> 01:46:45.466]  That is good.
[01:46:45.466 --> 01:46:50.349]  So the more we can make that clear to everybody, whether they're a Democrat or a Republican, the better.
[01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:55.653]  You were mentioning earlier the jihadis.
[01:46:55.653 --> 01:47:01.119]  I mean, Europe advertises, the former head of the EU is the head of the migrant policy.
[01:47:01.119 --> 01:47:07.285]  Peter Sutherland says we need to take down Europe in public statements and end its cultural unity.
[01:47:07.285 --> 01:47:13.832]  They destabilize the Middle East, put the al-Qaeda jihadists and ISIS in, use Syria as a conduit into Turkey.
[01:47:14.412 --> 01:47:17.474]  Turkey creates a corridor, brings them into Eastern Western Europe.
[01:47:17.474 --> 01:47:20.176]  They advertise 80% are military age men.
[01:47:20.176 --> 01:47:22.657]  They're getting in sleeper cell positions.
[01:47:22.657 --> 01:47:24.779]  They're letting them in here, not checking their IDs.
[01:47:24.779 --> 01:47:26.460]  This is all on record.
[01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:34.765]  Preparing, obviously, a secret super assault, or what you said, a jihadist Western Tet Offensive.
[01:47:34.765 --> 01:47:42.570]  For folks that don't know military doctrine, explain to them what a sleeper cell is, or what a Tet Offensive is basically an example of.
[01:47:43.595 --> 01:47:51.423]  Well, I encourage folks to go read Matt Bracken's really good piece, he's a retired Navy SEAL, called TET Take Two, about what's happening in Europe.
[01:47:51.423 --> 01:48:03.975]  And all he's saying is, just like the North Yubanese and the South Yubanese Viet Cong did during the Tet Offensive, I believe it was 1968, where they pre-positioned their attack troops inside the cities, like Hawaii was a good example.
[01:48:04.335 --> 01:48:12.417]  The infiltrated the city during the festival, and they attacked during the Tet Festival, which is supposed to be a time of truce and peace.
[01:48:12.417 --> 01:48:16.558]  And they pre-positioned thousands and thousands of cells ready for combat.
[01:48:16.558 --> 01:48:19.179]  They cached weapons, and they got ready ahead of time.
[01:48:19.179 --> 01:48:22.180]  And as Bracken points out, that's exactly what's happening in Europe right now.
[01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:24.583]  You have ISIS telling us they're going to do this.
[01:48:24.583 --> 01:48:28.347]  They've already got, you know, these recently came out and said they had at least 400 units.
[01:48:28.347 --> 01:48:35.456]  So Bracken's estimation is at least 100,000 Islamic jihadists already pre-positioned, trained by ISIS, or encouraged by ISIS.
[01:48:35.456 --> 01:48:37.138]  And by the way, you're not exaggerating.
[01:48:37.138 --> 01:48:38.540]  You look at them, they're military.
[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:40.963]  A lot of them have Facebook where they admit they're military.
[01:48:41.503 --> 01:48:44.327]  They've been brought in, they've got commanders that are Saudi and others.
[01:48:44.327 --> 01:48:52.498]  This is really Saudi trying to put sleeper cells here, like the Russians did during the Cold War, as an ultimate option during, you know, a larger war.
[01:48:52.498 --> 01:48:54.721]  I can't believe our elites allowed this.
[01:48:54.721 --> 01:48:56.844]  I think 100,000 in Europe is conservative.
[01:48:56.844 --> 01:48:57.385]  Stuart, go ahead.
[01:48:58.348 --> 01:48:59.029]  Absolutely right.
[01:48:59.029 --> 01:49:06.856]  As Brecken points out, this is why you see kind of like an unholy alliance between the radical left and the Islamists.
[01:49:06.856 --> 01:49:15.124]  You might think, well, why would a bunch of radical leftists who supposedly support gay rights and women's rights, why would they support radical Islamists who would put them all to death?
[01:49:15.124 --> 01:49:16.826]  Well, the answer is that they have a common enemy.
[01:49:16.826 --> 01:49:18.087]  The enemy is Western civilization.
[01:49:18.467 --> 01:49:25.971]  So they want to destroy Western civilization, so they'll get in bed with someone you would think would be their own personal enemy, thinking they can control them down the road.
[01:49:25.971 --> 01:49:31.213]  They can use them as a force multiplier, as part of their creative destruction, and then later control them.
[01:49:31.213 --> 01:49:32.294]  Of course, they're wrong.
[01:49:32.294 --> 01:49:35.195]  They'll wind up with their heads chopped off at the end, if they prevail.
[01:49:35.195 --> 01:49:41.398]  So what we have to do to counter this is, once again, get back to the Founders' ideal, which is the people, us, as the militia,
[01:49:41.758 --> 01:49:52.742]  So I encourage people to get together with their neighbors and form neighborhood launches, get together with all the veterans in their community, and form a civil defense team, a community defense team, whatever it is.
[01:49:52.742 --> 01:49:58.925]  Get in conjunction with your local law enforcement, who are constitutionalists and good sheriffs, and be his posse and get it started.
[01:49:58.985 --> 01:50:00.185]  Stuart, let me stop you right there.
[01:50:00.185 --> 01:50:01.206]  I mean, I'll be honest.
[01:50:01.206 --> 01:50:05.027]  I thought we had more time, because I know how hard it is for the globals to roll stuff out.
[01:50:05.027 --> 01:50:08.009]  They're so far behind, I thought they were going to push it off.
[01:50:08.009 --> 01:50:09.469]  Instead, they've accelerated it.
[01:50:09.469 --> 01:50:13.351]  And about two, three years ago, you said, look, I'm giving up on politics partially.
[01:50:13.351 --> 01:50:23.615]  I think everybody should focus on your sheriffs, your counties, your cities getting ready to have basically our own safe zones, green zones for us, because they're going to move against us.
[01:50:23.615 --> 01:50:26.736]  And then we had intel about they're going to try to start race war, they're going to try to start class war.
[01:50:27.176 --> 01:50:30.120]  I thought really the elites are really going to destabilize their own nest.
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:31.842]  Well, you've been proven right.
[01:50:31.842 --> 01:50:33.103]  It's now happening.
[01:50:33.103 --> 01:50:37.629]  And I'm actually getting in a position now with Trump to educate people supporting him.
[01:50:37.629 --> 01:50:39.751]  But maybe only 30, 40 percent of my energy.
[01:50:39.751 --> 01:50:40.673]  Now it really is.
[01:50:40.673 --> 01:50:41.393]  Look, folks.
[01:50:42.961 --> 01:50:51.285]  Educate your local government, get involved, get people you can trust, learn how to use a firearm, get storable food, get medical supplies, because it's now a probability.
[01:50:51.285 --> 01:50:54.667]  We're going to have a long, dark winter, depression.
[01:50:54.667 --> 01:51:04.171]  They're going to use it to organize people in the big cities into these armies to come out into the rural areas and try to conscript people that aren't domesticated as their slaves, basically.
[01:51:04.171 --> 01:51:10.134]  This is communism, and I really think we're going to face the darkest scenarios possible in America.
[01:51:10.774 --> 01:51:16.837]  I mean, really seriously, you need to get ready for full occupation, people coming to dig you out, and full-on war.
[01:51:16.837 --> 01:51:18.979]  And by the way, you can't capitulate and join them.
[01:51:18.979 --> 01:51:20.339]  They're coming after everybody.
[01:51:20.339 --> 01:51:22.020]  They want to fully gut the country.
[01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:28.004]  So let's talk about future battle space, how we get ready for this, because it's clear that they're planning a hot takeover.
[01:51:29.159 --> 01:51:29.780]  Absolutely.
[01:51:29.780 --> 01:51:36.864]  I think what you have to do is tap into the reservoir of knowledge and training you already have in your local community, especially among your veterans.
[01:51:36.864 --> 01:51:45.370]  I encourage people to, you know, go beat down the doors of your local VFW and anywhere else you can find veterans, which is why we're going to be on the college campuses as well.
[01:51:45.370 --> 01:51:53.176]  We want to be there to grab the returning Afghan and Iraq veterans and bring them into, you know, helping us to train, you know, the American people.
[01:51:53.576 --> 01:51:55.537]  So start with a neighborhood watch.
[01:51:55.537 --> 01:52:02.179]  Recruit the veterans, retired cops, retired doctors and nurses, all the talent you're going to need in your neighborhood that's already there.
[01:52:02.179 --> 01:52:04.059]  Go find them and recruit them.
[01:52:04.059 --> 01:52:06.960]  And then the next step after that is to work on your local sheriff.
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:09.981]  Elect a good county sheriff and then form a posse behind him.
[01:52:09.981 --> 01:52:14.763]  But along the way, if you can be a volunteer firefighter, search and rescue, EMT, go join that.
[01:52:14.763 --> 01:52:18.744]  Become part of your first responder community and make it stronger and get ready as you can.
[01:52:20.623 --> 01:52:25.354]  Other points, because you always have a lot of points, a lot of breaking news, a lot of stories that are important, and I ask the questions here.
[01:52:25.354 --> 01:52:30.064]  I want to have you, you know, basically ask the questions by bringing out the topics.
[01:52:30.064 --> 01:52:31.166]  What else is on your radar?
[01:52:32.486 --> 01:52:44.213]  Well, a big one for us is the concern, there's a recent book we put out called Day of Wrath, which is about a hypothetical potential mass terror attack in the United States of jihadi cells attacking schools.
[01:52:44.213 --> 01:52:46.354]  We think this is extremely likely.
[01:52:46.354 --> 01:52:51.597]  So we want people to be, in particular, focused on the active shooter threat to your local schools.
[01:52:52.117 --> 01:52:55.900]  And of course, we know that the elites don't want us to protect our children.
[01:52:55.900 --> 01:53:00.683]  They want them open to being slaughtered in a victim disarmament zone.
[01:53:00.683 --> 01:53:04.686]  So I think the most important thing for us to do is find a way to counteract that.
[01:53:04.686 --> 01:53:10.990]  So we encourage our veterans to go and talk to the local police department and make sure they know how to communicate and coordinate.
[01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:14.272]  Because when the crap comes down, like here where I live, there's no SWAT team.
[01:53:14.272 --> 01:53:16.914]  It's going to be up to us local veterans because the police will be overwhelmed.
[01:53:16.914 --> 01:53:17.755]  And they realize this.
[01:53:18.095 --> 01:53:28.041]  So we're already working with them to coordinate so that if we do have a peasant-style attack on a school, we veterans can go in and help them stop it as fast as possible and stop the killing.
[01:53:28.883 --> 01:53:29.684]  Absolutely.
[01:53:29.684 --> 01:53:40.911]  And again, the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, to a great extent, correct me if I'm wrong, they're starting to lose their hold on the police and military as they discover they're basically multinational disinformation operatives.
[01:53:40.911 --> 01:53:46.275]  Even the FBI says they don't use the Southern Poverty Law Center's and ADL's info anymore.
[01:53:46.275 --> 01:53:50.098]  A lot of police departments are learning that they're giving them awards, paying off police
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:58.567]  Folks are realizing that these are basically outside institutions, basically infiltration, espionage organizations.
[01:53:58.567 --> 01:54:03.332]  Do you concur with that or what's your breakdown on the fact that those groups are now really getting discredited?
[01:54:04.190 --> 01:54:04.950]  Absolutely.
[01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:15.054]  They're discrediting themselves because when they attack anybody who's conservative, anyone who's a constitutionalist, anybody who stands for traditional American values will be attacked as a racist and an extremist.
[01:54:15.054 --> 01:54:17.375]  So your average beat cop is like mine.
[01:54:17.375 --> 01:54:19.836]  They look at that and go, wait a minute, that's me.
[01:54:19.836 --> 01:54:22.077]  So I think they've discredited themselves.
[01:54:22.077 --> 01:54:23.657]  They don't need our help to do that.
[01:54:23.657 --> 01:54:25.558]  So I don't really worry about them anymore.
[01:54:25.558 --> 01:54:28.979]  I just go talk to the police and we ignore Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:54:28.979 --> 01:54:30.920]  We talk to the cops and say,
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:33.061]  We're the guys who guarded the recruiting centers.
[01:54:33.061 --> 01:54:36.824]  We're the guys who were on the rooftops in Ferguson, you know, guarding against arsonists.
[01:54:36.824 --> 01:54:38.085]  And we're here to back you up.
[01:54:38.085 --> 01:54:45.269]  We have a new program called Operation Go Forth, which is named after the Texas police officer who was shot in the back of the head while getting gassed.
[01:54:45.269 --> 01:54:50.053]  And all this is going to be is a national version of what our South Carolina chapter has been doing ever since then.
[01:54:50.053 --> 01:54:56.037]  Every time I see a cop getting a donut or a coffee or getting gassed, I'll stop and overwatch him in case he's attacked.
[01:54:56.037 --> 01:54:57.137]  I can back him up.
[01:54:57.137 --> 01:55:01.080]  So they see in our communities that we're the good guys and we're right there with them.
[01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:04.403]  So long as they honor the Constitution, we're their best allies.
[01:55:04.403 --> 01:55:06.725]  If they violate it, of course, we'll call them out.
[01:55:06.725 --> 01:55:09.928]  But they understand that we are willing to put ourselves on the line.
[01:55:09.928 --> 01:55:14.112]  Mark Potok of Southern Poverty Law Center is not going to be backing up any cop at any time soon.
[01:55:14.112 --> 01:55:21.258]  He's not going to be there to stop looters and rioters or stand with that cop against anybody else in the community who's using violence.
[01:55:21.258 --> 01:55:21.759]  We will be.
[01:55:23.945 --> 01:55:27.486]  I tell you, I really think the globalists like George Soros have miscalculated.
[01:55:27.486 --> 01:55:28.967]  They've taken down a lot of Arab countries.
[01:55:28.967 --> 01:55:30.808]  They've taken down Ukraine.
[01:55:30.808 --> 01:55:36.910]  But we've just been warning people for too long, back to the days of Barry Goldwater, and now it's all coming true.
[01:55:36.910 --> 01:55:38.971]  The Liberty Movement's credibility is only rising.
[01:55:38.971 --> 01:55:45.774]  And you know, I'm negative when I need to be, Stuart, but I have to be very positive about the work that so many people have done.
[01:55:47.330 --> 01:55:49.372]  Oath keepers and countless others.
[01:55:49.372 --> 01:55:52.976]  It's very exciting to know that we're not going to be caught flat-footed here.
[01:55:52.976 --> 01:56:05.368]  And now that people get it, I'm seeing a maximum effort develop to really intensify preparation, but also informational warfare locally with the truth.
[01:56:05.368 --> 01:56:08.792]  Now is the time to break the enemy's back politically, is my view.
[01:56:09.907 --> 01:56:11.688]  Absolutely, that's why it's so important.
[01:56:11.688 --> 01:56:20.432]  Films like this one, James Yeager's films, and now Chuck Andersey's film, Revelation, Rise of Global Governments, is important because it's coming at the perfect time.
[01:56:20.432 --> 01:56:30.656]  A lot of Americans are paying attention to what's happening during this political season, and they're seeing, as you said, right in their face, they're seeing the manipulation of both political parties like never before.
[01:56:30.956 --> 01:56:33.819]  And you can't dismiss it as, you know, sour grapes of Ron Paulers.
[01:56:33.819 --> 01:56:35.200]  This is not Ron Paulers anymore.
[01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:40.485]  This is a much broader support base for Trump that's seeing the exact same thing being done to them.
[01:56:40.485 --> 01:56:48.432]  So it's the perfect time for us to say, you know, yes, we told you so, but hey, look, here's what we can do together, whether we agreed in the past or not.
[01:56:49.133 --> 01:56:50.854]  Here's how we go forward from here.
[01:56:50.854 --> 01:56:54.535]  Here's a big download of information and get them up to speed.
[01:56:54.535 --> 01:57:02.778]  And so a lot of people living in the movement get kind of ticked off and they get jaded about being able to reach out to their fellow Americans.
[01:57:02.778 --> 01:57:03.798]  I think now is a great time.
[01:57:04.318 --> 01:57:04.999]  Absolutely.
[01:57:04.999 --> 01:57:06.160]  And get outside your family.
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:07.621]  Sometimes your family won't listen to you.
[01:57:07.621 --> 01:57:08.482]  A salesman will tell you that.
[01:57:08.482 --> 01:57:10.243]  Don't try to sell a vacuum cleaner to your family.
[01:57:10.243 --> 01:57:11.905]  Sell it to the, you know, guy down the road.
[01:57:11.905 --> 01:57:15.028]  I mean, get out there and just speak out.
[01:57:15.028 --> 01:57:15.929]  That's what it takes.
[01:57:15.929 --> 01:57:16.629]  Now's the time.
[01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:17.790]  People are ready to listen.
[01:57:17.790 --> 01:57:25.417]  Let's play a clip where a little boy this last weekend in Houston came out, and this was his take after seeing the new film, Revelation.
[01:57:25.417 --> 01:57:30.161]  Get movie tickets if you're in Texas right now, or find out more at revelationthemovie.info.
[01:57:30.161 --> 01:57:30.602]  Here's a clip.
[01:57:31.471 --> 01:57:32.472]  What did you think of the movie?
[01:57:32.472 --> 01:57:33.352]  Did you like it?
[01:57:33.352 --> 01:57:34.033]  I loved it.
[01:57:34.033 --> 01:57:35.414]  It was really informative.
[01:57:35.414 --> 01:57:39.217]  Did you learn something you didn't know?
[01:57:39.217 --> 01:57:40.198]  Definitely, yes.
[01:57:40.198 --> 01:57:49.565]  I didn't know about a New World Order and how there's a top 1% about the Rockefellers and everything like that.
[01:57:49.565 --> 01:57:51.126]  But that was really fun.
[01:57:51.126 --> 01:57:51.506]  Okay.
[01:57:51.506 --> 01:57:54.368]  What was your favorite, favorite part?
[01:57:54.368 --> 01:57:56.910]  My favorite part was when Ted Nugent came on.
[01:57:59.983 --> 01:58:02.424]  So it's a great film, and people need to see it.
[01:58:02.424 --> 01:58:17.791]  And again, how films work, folks, is if it sells out for a week or so in Houston, then more theaters will pick it up, and then we can promote that list, and then that's how you launch a film without spending millions and millions of dollars of promotion, and we've seen a lot of films really take off, and I just want to
[01:58:18.231 --> 01:58:19.551]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:00:06.113 --> 02:00:10.176]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:10.176 --> 02:00:12.538]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:12.538 --> 02:00:16.861]  Merle Haggard!
[02:00:21.798 --> 02:00:30.144]  He's gone over the mountain.
[02:00:30.144 --> 02:00:34.948]  Well, the story of the Battle of the Republic is just beginning.
[02:00:34.948 --> 02:00:36.669]  They've been fighting this table for a long time.
[02:00:36.669 --> 02:00:42.174]  We slowed it down, but unlimited money and manipulation, they keep pushing, and now we're to the edge of the cliff.
[02:00:43.012 --> 02:00:44.613]  There's a little secret, though.
[02:00:44.613 --> 02:00:49.395]  When we go over the edge, they go over it with us, and the fight begins.
[02:00:49.395 --> 02:00:51.856]  Stuart Rhodes, OathKeepers.org is our guest.
[02:00:51.856 --> 02:00:54.697]  I'm going to play a trailer to the new film, Revelation.
[02:00:54.697 --> 02:00:58.759]  We have a special guest who was inside the Muslim Brotherhood, the PLO.
[02:00:58.759 --> 02:01:00.980]  All of it, he was one of them, high level.
[02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:03.921]  And for the last few decades, he's become a Christian, has been exposing it.
[02:01:03.921 --> 02:01:05.701]  Kamal Saleem is going to be joining us.
[02:01:05.701 --> 02:01:06.842]  He's in the film.
[02:01:06.842 --> 02:01:08.503]  You want to stay with us for that.
[02:01:09.423 --> 02:01:11.904]  And again, I'm not here bashing Muslims straight out.
[02:01:11.904 --> 02:01:13.284]  I know a lot of folks have been overseas.
[02:01:13.284 --> 02:01:15.825]  I've had a lot of Muslim friends in college and high school.
[02:01:15.825 --> 02:01:19.626]  But a large portion of Islam is very radical, wants to take over.
[02:01:19.626 --> 02:01:20.766]  We call it Orthodox Islam.
[02:01:20.766 --> 02:01:24.787]  You know, that's what started as an expansionist religion.
[02:01:24.787 --> 02:01:27.928]  And now that's who's taking over all of Islam.
[02:01:27.928 --> 02:01:29.729]  It's who the globalists are backing.
[02:01:29.729 --> 02:01:32.850]  It's who they're turning loose all over the world against our allies like Egypt.
[02:01:33.806 --> 02:01:40.569]  And now they're coming here, and that's really why I'm saying the next wave is not false flag, folks.
[02:01:40.569 --> 02:01:44.871]  It's our government letting them in to, I guess, bring in martial law after.
[02:01:44.871 --> 02:01:46.412]  Stewart, that's what I have trouble with.
[02:01:46.412 --> 02:01:55.256]  How will the political elite let the sleeper cells in, let them attack as they have been doing, intensifying, probing, testing, and then not have the political elite get in trouble?
[02:01:55.256 --> 02:02:01.859]  Instead, Merkel and Hollande and Obama get more power out of the attacks they were the progenitors of.
[02:02:03.251 --> 02:02:05.612]  Well, they've been doing that for decades.
[02:02:05.612 --> 02:02:08.994]  It's the creative destruction.
[02:02:08.994 --> 02:02:14.296]  And, you know, Mussolini and Hitler, every dictator in world history has followed the same playbook.
[02:02:14.296 --> 02:02:16.157]  And they get away with it because they control the media.
[02:02:16.157 --> 02:02:21.460]  That's why it's important for guys like you and guys like me and the filmmakers that are out there now.
[02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:25.622]  I mean, this is a chance for a mainstream film distribution possibly.
[02:02:25.622 --> 02:02:27.743]  I've never seen it in a film.
[02:02:28.283 --> 02:02:34.193]  These topics are discussed, and there's a chance for us, as you said, to do well enough in Texas, it'll spread across the country.
[02:02:34.193 --> 02:02:40.624]  Yeah, we've got national distributors right now ready to put $6 million behind putting it in theaters nationwide, if it does well in Texas.
[02:02:40.624 --> 02:02:41.626]  So it's important, that's why.
[02:02:42.432 --> 02:02:44.033]  Absolutely, absolutely right.
[02:02:44.033 --> 02:02:50.777]  But, you know, even besides that, the American people are now, because of the internet, because of free exchange of information, they're starting to see this game.
[02:02:50.777 --> 02:02:52.738]  And that's why they're taking the mask off.
[02:02:52.738 --> 02:02:54.199]  They're doing it much more overtly.
[02:02:54.199 --> 02:03:00.263]  I think a lot of them, a lot of the elites believe, well, sure, you see what we're doing, but you can't do anything about it.
[02:03:00.263 --> 02:03:05.105]  In the end, their own hubris is allowing them to step out and say, we don't care if you see us.
[02:03:05.105 --> 02:03:06.526]  We don't have to hide it anymore.
[02:03:06.526 --> 02:03:07.287]  It's right in your face.
[02:03:07.287 --> 02:03:08.427]  What are you going to do about it?
[02:03:08.427 --> 02:03:10.989]  But as you said, we're going to go over the cliff with them.
[02:03:11.129 --> 02:03:12.609]  And there's no way out but through.
[02:03:12.609 --> 02:03:13.590]  So get ready, folks.
[02:03:13.590 --> 02:03:15.630]  Get ready for the fight.
[02:03:15.630 --> 02:03:16.830]  Yeah, that's absolutely right.
[02:03:16.830 --> 02:03:18.330]  We've got two minutes left, Stuart.
[02:03:18.330 --> 02:03:26.492]  Oathkeepers.org, great t-shirts, great news updates, you know, great way to support you guys is to go there and get a t-shirt and support the Oathkeepers.
[02:03:26.492 --> 02:03:29.033]  Try to give your military or police a chapter in your area.
[02:03:29.033 --> 02:03:31.113]  They've got tens of thousands of folks that are part of it.
[02:03:31.113 --> 02:03:34.134]  You really scare the establishment, so I salute you there.
[02:03:34.134 --> 02:03:35.414]  What else do you want to add, Stuart?
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:41.922]  Well, I think people need to focus on the most elemental questions are your own personal security.
[02:03:41.922 --> 02:03:43.782]  You know, who's on your buddy team?
[02:03:43.782 --> 02:03:44.683]  Who's on your fire team?
[02:03:44.683 --> 02:03:45.863]  Who's on your squad?
[02:03:45.863 --> 02:03:48.124]  Who can you call on within a minute's notice?
[02:03:48.124 --> 02:03:49.504]  Within five minutes notice.
[02:03:49.504 --> 02:03:53.645]  When you're in trouble in your own home, in your own neighborhood, do you have security?
[02:03:53.645 --> 02:03:54.226]  Can you call?
[02:03:54.226 --> 02:03:55.666]  Is there anybody you can call on?
[02:03:55.666 --> 02:03:57.487]  So form those alliances now.
[02:03:57.487 --> 02:03:59.167]  Form those neighborhood watches.
[02:03:59.167 --> 02:04:04.849]  That's the most important thing you can do is be ready to defend yourself and your community together.
[02:04:05.149 --> 02:04:06.933]  Learn who you can trust yesterday.
[02:04:06.933 --> 02:04:10.382]  That's right.
[02:04:10.382 --> 02:04:12.887]  And you know, and your neighbors, even if you don't agree with them on everything.
[02:04:13.297 --> 02:04:20.621]  You all agree you don't want to be murdered by MS-13 or any other gang that comes through your door or some Islamist cell down the street.
[02:04:20.621 --> 02:04:23.643]  So get together and agree on that one thing.
[02:04:23.643 --> 02:04:27.625]  And we're here to preserve life, liberty, and property as the founders intended.
[02:04:27.625 --> 02:04:30.667]  And the Neighborhood Watch is the most basic structure for doing that.
[02:04:30.667 --> 02:04:31.768]  Last question.
[02:04:31.768 --> 02:04:33.569]  Mexico is a failed state now.
[02:04:33.569 --> 02:04:34.449]  Do you think the U.S.
[02:04:34.449 --> 02:04:35.590]  is headed towards something that bad?
[02:04:37.458 --> 02:04:38.079]  Um, yes.
[02:04:38.079 --> 02:04:43.364]  I think you might see a massive flood of refugees coming from Mexico and Central and South America when those economies implode.
[02:04:43.364 --> 02:04:54.295]  One way for the elites to do it is to implode those economies first, drive a massive exodus of refugees north of the border, and then use that to... Colonel Schaffer says that's a real plan.
[02:04:54.295 --> 02:04:55.356]  God bless you, Stuart Rhodes.
[02:04:55.356 --> 02:04:56.016]  Talk to you soon.
[02:04:56.016 --> 02:04:57.518]  We'll be back with another special guest.
[02:04:58.683 --> 02:05:00.705]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[02:05:00.705 --> 02:05:04.129]  Textilizer wants to be a breathalyzer for your cell phone.
[02:05:04.129 --> 02:05:05.971]  Article up by Gizmodo.
[02:05:05.971 --> 02:05:09.435]  Distracted driving is a hazard up there with drinking and driving.
[02:05:09.435 --> 02:05:15.062]  A solution proposed in a draft New York legislation would solve that using a roadside phone
[02:05:15.322 --> 02:05:16.043]  Analyzer.
[02:05:16.043 --> 02:05:23.988]  The bill provides for the field testing for use of mobile telephones and portable electronic devices while driving after an accident or collision.
[02:05:23.988 --> 02:05:31.914]  After being involved in an accident, a driver would have to submit their phone for roadside testing or face an automatic suspension of their license.
[02:05:31.914 --> 02:05:36.657]  That testing would be done anonymously using a device that would only look at metadata.
[02:05:36.657 --> 02:05:37.278]  Hmm.
[02:05:37.278 --> 02:05:37.938]  Yeah.
[02:05:37.938 --> 02:05:38.579]  Sure, buddy.
[02:05:38.579 --> 02:05:41.981]  The actual content of a message, picture or game would not be revealed.
[02:05:41.981 --> 02:05:43.322]  Yeah, I don't believe that one.
[02:05:43.502 --> 02:05:46.785]  Seeing as how the NSA and others are putting their fingers in everything.
[02:05:46.785 --> 02:05:56.014]  A driver under suspicion of distracted driving will be under extreme pressure to unlock their phone to prove their innocence, giving officers full access to everything on a handset.
[02:05:56.014 --> 02:05:58.256]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.

[02:07:41.555 --> 02:07:48.780]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:07:48.780 --> 02:07:49.581]  10% off on auto ship.
[02:07:49.721 --> 02:07:52.161]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:52.161 --> 02:07:54.142]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[02:07:54.142 --> 02:07:58.603]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:07:58.603 --> 02:08:04.144]  There's an unseen hand that pulls the string.
[02:08:04.144 --> 02:08:07.725]  It makes his little purpose dance to every song he sings.
[02:08:07.725 --> 02:08:13.666]  As the night falls in on a rising tide.
[02:08:13.666 --> 02:08:16.846]  Look beyond the shadows.
[02:08:16.846 --> 02:08:19.247]  Behold a pale horse ride.
[02:08:25.146 --> 02:08:25.986]  We're good to go.
[02:08:51.213 --> 02:09:06.345]  I tell you, that's Charlie Daniels.
[02:09:06.345 --> 02:09:08.167]  Country Music Hall of Fame.
[02:09:08.167 --> 02:09:10.228]  He is the narrator.
[02:09:10.228 --> 02:09:16.294]  He's also on film in the documentary, Revelation, Dawn of Global Government.
[02:09:17.150 --> 02:09:20.411]  Chuck Undersheet was going to be on the phone and I said, hey, he's out in Fredericksburg.
[02:09:20.411 --> 02:09:21.191]  Former Army Colonel.
[02:09:21.191 --> 02:09:21.951]  Let him drive in.
[02:09:21.951 --> 02:09:22.972]  He's the director.
[02:09:22.972 --> 02:09:24.072]  So he's driving in.
[02:09:24.072 --> 02:09:26.453]  He'll be here about 33, 34 after.
[02:09:26.453 --> 02:09:33.255]  He'll be coming in hot off the road in studio as we're having three or four guests on today and a couple more in the next few days that are in the film.
[02:09:33.255 --> 02:09:43.878]  Everybody from Ted Nugent to General Boykin, former head of Special Forces, Stuart Rhodes, myself, Alex Jones, and so many others that are in the documentary film.
[02:09:45.060 --> 02:09:56.414]  And again, this film won't save the world, but all of us being involved, all of us in books, videos, preachers telling the truth, talk show hosts telling the truth, exposing what's happened will.
[02:09:56.414 --> 02:09:58.317]  I mean, the Pope's come out and called for world government now.
[02:09:59.378 --> 02:10:19.508]  I mean, this is a very, very scary time to be alive right now, and we see Western world allied with the most radical forms of Islam, overthrowing our allies in Egypt, overthrowing Gaddafi, wasn't a good guy, but a good guy compared to ISIS and Al-Qaeda, taking that over for a failed state, going into Syria, proxy wars with the Russians.
[02:10:19.508 --> 02:10:27.492]  I mean, this is a very, very dangerous time to be alive right now, and it's gotten to the point where Charlie Daniels is putting out songs, Behold a Pale Horse.
[02:10:28.697 --> 02:10:32.101]  By the way, that's as good as any of his music.
[02:10:32.101 --> 02:10:34.823]  The devil went down to Georgia, he was looking for a soul to steal.
[02:10:34.823 --> 02:10:37.206]  He was in a bind, he was way behind, he was looking to make a deal.
[02:10:37.206 --> 02:10:46.936]  So we're going to actually take that song, with Chuck's permission, we've got a music video out to promote the movie as well.
[02:10:46.936 --> 02:10:48.738]  Revelationthemovie.info.
[02:10:48.738 --> 02:10:51.020]  It's going to be shown a few places in Texas.
[02:10:51.641 --> 02:10:58.966]  And then if it sells out there when it shows, the first weekend or so, then other movie theaters will look at that and then start picking it up.
[02:10:58.966 --> 02:11:03.189]  And it's up to you if you want it to end up being on thousands of screens around the country.
[02:11:03.189 --> 02:11:07.572]  I have produced films that have been on hundreds of screens and been seen by a hundred million people online.
[02:11:08.604 --> 02:11:10.045]  And so I know how this works.
[02:11:10.045 --> 02:11:11.746]  I don't have a financial stake in this.
[02:11:11.746 --> 02:11:13.947]  I have a stake in it, just wanting it to be successful.
[02:11:13.947 --> 02:11:15.588]  Anders, he's put everything he has into it.
[02:11:15.588 --> 02:11:22.492]  He's a guy who used to make big TV commercials and TV shows and stuff, and he put everything he had into making this film.
[02:11:22.492 --> 02:11:26.515]  And there's other great films coming out as well that are very, very exciting that we're going to be promoting.
[02:11:26.515 --> 02:11:29.397]  There's one that, you know, that Chuck Norris' son and
[02:11:30.782 --> 02:11:37.468]  Gary Haven and others are putting out as well that I'm in as well, but it's a fictional account of a world government takeover.
[02:11:37.468 --> 02:11:41.792]  That's going to be airing on National Cable after it has its theater run.
[02:11:41.792 --> 02:11:47.016]  So there's a lot of stuff going on out there where we're trying to counter the establishment.
[02:11:47.016 --> 02:11:54.603]  And I just saw even a New York Times article last week that Christian Films, there's also a CNS article, are now some of the most successful out there.
[02:11:55.760 --> 02:12:02.786]  And conservative and libertarian and anti-globalist films from a patriot perspective, not left or right.
[02:12:02.786 --> 02:12:05.449]  And that shows, quote, the markets there.
[02:12:05.449 --> 02:12:12.455]  Well, if these films become successful and then dominant, that will take over from Hollywood and they've lost.
[02:12:12.455 --> 02:12:16.559]  So you can also vote with your dollars, vote with your actions in a culture war.
[02:12:16.559 --> 02:12:19.721]  Now joining us at the bottom of the hour is a man I want to get on for a full hour.
[02:12:20.862 --> 02:12:29.113]  In the near future, Kamal Saleem was born into a large Sunni Muslim family in the heart of the Middle East.
[02:12:29.113 --> 02:12:32.217]  And of course, that's the group Saudi Arabia is pushing in to take over all over.
[02:12:32.217 --> 02:12:38.805]  Kamal was then recruited by the Muslim Brotherhood at an early age and completed his first mission in Israel at the age of seven.
[02:12:39.446 --> 02:12:45.969]  Kamal was also recruited by the Palestinian Liberation Organization, PLO, and other radical Muslim groups.
[02:12:45.969 --> 02:12:52.813]  The many years of his radical Islamist training resulted in Kamal mastering every form of divisive extremist tactic.
[02:12:52.813 --> 02:12:58.456]  Kamal has since become a man on a new mission as an ambassador for Christ, the one true living God.
[02:12:58.456 --> 02:13:02.197]  He is well-versed in the Holy Bible, Quran, Hadith, Sharia law.
[02:13:02.197 --> 02:13:04.799]  He believes that radical Islam is the most broadly disguised
[02:13:05.359 --> 02:13:06.000]  I don't think so.
[02:13:18.075 --> 02:13:26.462]  An autobiography entitled, The Blood of Lambs, that's available at koomeministries.com, K-O-O-M-E ministries dot com.
[02:13:26.462 --> 02:13:36.950]  He's also co-authored The Coalition, a novel that is the first in a series, and a merger of fiction and reality projecting the future, Global War on Terror, released in November of 2014.
[02:13:40.293 --> 02:13:43.197]  Kamal Saleem, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:13:43.197 --> 02:13:54.633]  I know it takes a lot of courage what you've done in the last few decades as somebody who's been on the inside coming on the outside because isn't that an automatic death sentence once you've, you know, been involved in what you were involved in to then leave it?
[02:13:55.464 --> 02:13:56.885]  Yes, you're absolutely right.
[02:13:56.885 --> 02:14:02.206]  Alex, it's good to be with you, and thank you for being a shining light for all of us.
[02:14:02.206 --> 02:14:03.847]  You've been there as a soldier, too.
[02:14:03.847 --> 02:14:06.608]  I'm thankful for you and what you do.
[02:14:06.608 --> 02:14:07.408]  Yes, it is.
[02:14:07.408 --> 02:14:14.771]  In Islam, it's called apostasy, and Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam, in his traditions, in the Hadith, said, if anyone converts, kill him.
[02:14:16.215 --> 02:14:16.835]  Wow.
[02:14:16.835 --> 02:14:18.296]  Tell us, I mean, I want to talk about the film.
[02:14:18.296 --> 02:14:19.876]  You're a big part of the film.
[02:14:19.876 --> 02:14:21.877]  Revelationofthemovie.info.
[02:14:21.877 --> 02:14:33.400]  Just give us a preview the next time you come on, because I know you're just a highly regarded, really smart guy, and I hope you become part of the show, giving us inside intel and understanding from what you've witnessed to decipher what's happening.
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:36.941]  But just give us a snapshot of your awakening, what we're facing.
[02:14:36.941 --> 02:14:41.963]  A lot of folks are calling this a radical Islamic sleeper cell, Tet Offensive in the making.
[02:14:43.174 --> 02:14:47.036]  Tell us your experience, why you woke up, and what you think is coming, sir.
[02:14:47.036 --> 02:14:58.642]  Well, what's going on, all in all, that the isms are coming together, like Islamism, Socialism, Secularism, Fascism, Liberalism, Secularism.
[02:14:58.642 --> 02:15:03.084]  All of them are part of the ism movement for the last days, and they are united together
[02:15:03.655 --> 02:15:19.800]  For one world order to, you know, to make the whole world in pluralism, one state, one heart, and therefore it will throw off the whole civilization into protection from different things and now they have to go under a world government.
[02:15:20.592 --> 02:15:24.737]  In my experience, I was born in Beirut, Lebanon to a Muslim Sunni family.
[02:15:24.737 --> 02:15:27.821]  My first person who radicalized me was my mom.
[02:15:27.821 --> 02:15:32.446]  Out of 14 brothers and sisters, we were radicalized, the boys.
[02:15:32.446 --> 02:15:38.133]  My mother told me, if you kill Jews and Christians, your hand will light up before the throne of Allah.
[02:15:38.695 --> 02:15:41.136]  And the host of heaven will celebrate what you did.
[02:15:41.136 --> 02:15:48.177]  From my childhood, my heart was to kill the deceivers, which is the Jews and the Christians.
[02:15:48.177 --> 02:15:56.159]  From there, I was recruited in the neighborhood mosque, which is in the mosque in the United States of America.
[02:15:56.159 --> 02:15:58.399]  It is not like the church.
[02:15:58.399 --> 02:16:02.280]  The mosque is an embassy to represent the Islamic State.
[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:07.661]  It is a parliament to send the people of the mosque to engage the civilization they are in.
[02:16:08.343 --> 02:16:14.405]  So therefore I was recruited in a mosque by a special group called the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:16:14.405 --> 02:16:18.806]  The Muslim Brotherhood came in 1928 after the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1924.
[02:16:18.806 --> 02:16:31.310]  And our agenda was, at that time when I was with them, is to re-establish the Islamic Caliphate and Islamic Sharia and One World Order under Allah.
[02:16:31.790 --> 02:16:47.358]  By establishing Ummah, you know, which is Islamic State, and this is what you see on the ISIS flag, the Muslim Brotherhood flag, the Saudi flag, you see the swords, you know, like there's no peace without the sword, unless the whole and everybody surrendered them.
[02:16:47.358 --> 02:16:53.422]  I was trained in my young age, at seven years old, that's when I was recruited, and I was
[02:16:54.488 --> 02:16:54.748]  You know,
[02:17:10.447 --> 02:17:39.390]  Sent to Israel at seven years old and eight years old and from there I was recruited by the Saudi Arabian government because I was raising fund from them for the cause and a call and when they found my heart is for Islam then they start utilizing me to the point they sent me to Europe to engage Europe in culture jihad and you see where Europe is and that was India in 1970 and what so have you in those years and from there
[02:17:40.422 --> 02:17:42.144]  They sent me to the United States of America.
[02:17:42.144 --> 02:17:47.489]  I was commissioned because we could not bring the American people from the outside.
[02:17:47.489 --> 02:17:50.792]  We have to inside America to take them down.
[02:17:50.792 --> 02:17:56.558]  And so therefore my award that they sent me to do, it was not like the 9-11 people.
[02:17:56.558 --> 02:17:59.581]  It was specifically, you know, still
[02:18:00.775 --> 02:18:06.201]  The methodology where America's we can work around and do everything that need to be done.
[02:18:06.201 --> 02:18:13.009]  So you were kind of preparing the ground and what information warfare to accept radical Islam coming in?
[02:18:13.009 --> 02:18:14.050]  Say it again, I'm sorry, forgive me.
[02:18:14.050 --> 02:18:15.732]  You were engaged in propaganda offensives?
[02:18:16.815 --> 02:18:17.696]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:18:17.696 --> 02:18:32.646]  You know, my job was to go to the jail system and create a clash of culture, recruit black African-Americans, and therefore, you know, and convert them to Islam and hope someday they will clash with the other race.
[02:18:32.646 --> 02:18:35.548]  And so we created a great divide and it has been accomplished.
[02:18:35.548 --> 02:18:43.053]  So you were trained by Saudi Arabia to create racial division in America, aligned Islam versus white Christianity?
[02:18:43.672 --> 02:18:51.255]  By the Muslim Brotherhood, Saudi Arabian, and you know, this is the Islamic culture that we were trained with and for.
[02:18:51.255 --> 02:18:55.236]  And our current administration has fulfilled that culture.
[02:18:55.236 --> 02:19:01.278]  But the other part is to invade the universities and the colleges to establish Muslim Student Association.
[02:19:03.218 --> 02:19:14.789]  That's an arm of the Muslim Brotherhood and there in that place what happened is to buy the professors, marry the American women, obtain the American citizenship so we can fight America by the sword of Goliath.
[02:19:15.603 --> 02:19:18.644]  Which is their constitution to take their head off with.
[02:19:18.644 --> 02:19:24.707]  And then, the other part is to engage politicians, and by politicians power, by the God of Mammon.
[02:19:24.707 --> 02:19:29.068]  You know, because we know that a lot of politicians, money is very important to them.
[02:19:29.068 --> 02:19:37.932]  And last but not least, engage the poor neighborhood, where they are weak, and they're hungry, and nobody want to touch them there.
[02:19:37.932 --> 02:19:41.433]  We can thrive on there, feed them, and change their culture from within.
[02:19:42.976 --> 02:19:43.597]  Unbelievable.
[02:19:43.597 --> 02:19:45.579]  Military plan to take over.
[02:19:45.579 --> 02:19:46.540]  Kamal Saleem.
[02:19:46.540 --> 02:19:47.601]  I want to briefly come back.
[02:19:47.601 --> 02:19:49.843]  We're going to be back for a full hour very soon, sir.
[02:19:49.843 --> 02:19:57.691]  I want you to talk about how you woke up and then what some of the things you cover in the new film that starts premiering in Texas this weekend.
[02:19:57.691 --> 02:19:59.333]  RevelationTheMovie.info, folks.

[02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:05.923]  When Dr. Lane Sebring appeared on Fox News and claimed that he could give seniors a second shot at youth, viewers were highly skeptical.
[02:22:05.923 --> 02:22:07.744]  But then, they saw the proof.
[02:22:07.744 --> 02:22:14.746]  Despite being 61 years old, Dr. Sebring is still competing in martial arts competitions against guys half his age and winning.
[02:22:14.746 --> 02:22:18.328]  But what's even more remarkable are his lab tests that back it all up.
[02:22:18.328 --> 02:22:23.510]  His blood pressure checks in at a healthy 110 over 78, and his blood sugar never jumps above 70.
[02:22:24.210 --> 02:22:25.431]  So what's his secret?
[02:22:25.431 --> 02:22:30.693]  Sebring has been using a powerful green drink that he personally formulated called Patriot Power Greens.
[02:22:30.693 --> 02:22:36.915]  Patriot Power Greens was originally created to help older guys in the military who are dealing with achy joints and stiff muscles.

[02:24:08.215 --> 02:24:15.559]  KoumMinistries.com, find his books.
[02:24:15.559 --> 02:24:16.039]  He's right.
[02:24:16.039 --> 02:24:19.301]  I want to get him back for a full hour in the near future to take your calls.
[02:24:19.301 --> 02:24:25.225]  This is a conspiracy of different evil organizations who all are just allied against Christianity.
[02:24:25.225 --> 02:24:32.649]  I mean, Obama won't let, for like, the latest number was 700 and something refugees came in that were almost all Sunni, and he let in three Christians.
[02:24:34.192 --> 02:24:35.593]  And it's mainly Christians being slaughtered.
[02:24:35.593 --> 02:24:36.053]  And the U.N.
[02:24:36.053 --> 02:24:39.294]  admits slaughter of Christians doubled the last 10 years.
[02:24:39.294 --> 02:24:42.015]  Peaceful Christians are being targeted everywhere for no reason.
[02:24:42.015 --> 02:24:44.156]  Because there's a spirit.
[02:24:44.156 --> 02:24:48.737]  And I wanted to talk about his awakening, why he woke up and said no, and has been fighting it for decades.
[02:24:48.737 --> 02:24:50.578]  And then talk a few minutes about the film.
[02:24:50.578 --> 02:24:53.739]  And then we've got the maker of the film set to be in studio.
[02:24:53.739 --> 02:25:01.542]  But Mr. Saleem, please continue with how you woke up and then other tidbits that you break down in the film that's going to be showing this weekend in Texas.
[02:25:02.363 --> 02:25:04.364]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:25:04.364 --> 02:25:13.551]  The thing is, in 1985, I had a severe car wreck that I cracked my neck in two places, and my left side was broken in many places.
[02:25:13.551 --> 02:25:20.416]  In the process, I met a man and two other physicians, all were Christians.
[02:25:20.416 --> 02:25:27.801]  At the end of the day, they took me home to recover because the hospital was ready to let me go, but they took me home to take care of me.
[02:25:28.604 --> 02:25:31.788]  There in their home, I discovered something totally different.
[02:25:31.788 --> 02:25:36.174]  That all the lie that I was told, that we worship the same God.
[02:25:36.174 --> 02:25:42.402]  I thought we really did, but I found out Jehovah God Almighty and Allah are not the same God.
[02:25:42.402 --> 02:25:44.505]  They're two different Gods.
[02:25:44.505 --> 02:25:46.768]  And when I examined them, I found out
[02:25:47.348 --> 02:25:53.730]  One God so loved the world, the other God, there's no love and mercy in His creation.
[02:25:53.730 --> 02:25:54.731]  His name is not love.
[02:25:54.731 --> 02:26:00.033]  And He said if the whole world was worth anything to Him, He would destroy it time and time again.
[02:26:00.033 --> 02:26:01.333]  And the list goes on.
[02:26:01.333 --> 02:26:05.795]  But from there, I watched the biggest Bible that I've seen in my life.
[02:26:05.795 --> 02:26:13.057]  That was how these Christian people lived their life and how the husband treated his wife like a princess and not like a slave.
[02:26:13.057 --> 02:26:14.298]  Versus how we treated
[02:26:14.978 --> 02:26:20.419]  Our daughters and our wives and our, you know, the whole family as women.
[02:26:20.419 --> 02:26:23.420]  And from there, you know, I've discovered something new.
[02:26:23.420 --> 02:26:26.861]  It's called unconditional love that I never was familiar with.
[02:26:26.861 --> 02:26:29.982]  In Islam, there's nothing, there's no unconditional love.
[02:26:29.982 --> 02:26:31.902]  Everything's conditional.
[02:26:31.902 --> 02:26:38.204]  So therefore, my favorite wife, the more, if you dishonor me, I have the right to take your head off, to behead you.
[02:26:38.204 --> 02:26:43.345]  And vice versa, if you convert from, from a Christian, from Muslim to Christian, then
[02:26:44.945 --> 02:26:46.506]  Your father has to kill you.
[02:26:46.506 --> 02:26:51.788]  You know, all this is part of the Islamic, you know, understanding of fundamentalism.
[02:26:51.788 --> 02:26:56.169]  And therefore, I walk there and I start seeing two different gods.
[02:26:56.169 --> 02:27:02.692]  And I realized, when I went to my home, I fell on my knees and I called my god and he didn't answer, but God of heaven and earth.
[02:27:03.252 --> 02:27:12.296]  The true living God answered me and his name was not Allah, his name was Yahweh and Jesus appeared and I changed my direction.
[02:27:12.296 --> 02:27:15.237]  He healed my body and he healed my heart and my mind.
[02:27:15.237 --> 02:27:27.982]  This is a miracle that truly will take a radical to change from one extreme to the other extreme because now I know the truth and this truth gotta be shared with America because America is the final frontier.
[02:27:28.562 --> 02:27:51.477]  And if America does not take a stand, this is the tipping point that America will never be the same again by this election from this time because it is really, we're not dealing with a president here, we're dealing with a whole new world order that they want to change America and the first enemy in the United States of America are the Christians and the second part are the Jews.
[02:27:51.477 --> 02:27:56.700]  Their agenda is, for example, is to take God and prayers out of education system.
[02:27:57.180 --> 02:28:00.522]  Reduce parental authority over children.
[02:28:00.522 --> 02:28:05.604]  Destroy the traditional Christian family structure.
[02:28:05.604 --> 02:28:09.786]  If sex is free, then abortion should be legal and free.
[02:28:09.786 --> 02:28:14.808]  Make divorce applicable to everybody because marriage has no value.
[02:28:15.448 --> 02:28:18.510]  Homosexuality be alternative lifestyle.
[02:28:18.510 --> 02:28:21.933]  Debase art and make it to run man.
[02:28:21.933 --> 02:28:25.916]  Use media to promote and change mindset.
[02:28:25.916 --> 02:28:27.097]  Mr. Slim, we're almost out of time.
[02:28:27.097 --> 02:28:28.117]  We're gonna have to make her in the movie.
[02:28:28.117 --> 02:28:31.080]  Check out UnderseaRevelationMovie.info is about to join us in the studio.
[02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:32.281]  But I want to invite you in the next few weeks.
[02:28:33.206 --> 02:28:36.708]  Back for a full hour, and just in closing, I want to name this interview.
[02:28:36.708 --> 02:28:39.929]  I mean, you're talking about Islamic State, but people think that's something new.
[02:28:39.929 --> 02:28:46.433]  As you pointed out, the Muslim Brotherhood, all these Wahhabist-based groups, Saudi Arabia, they've always been trying to create an Islamic State.
[02:28:46.433 --> 02:28:51.175]  Saudi Arabia's flag is green, but if you turn it black, it's the same as Al-Qaeda or ISIS.
[02:28:51.175 --> 02:28:57.939]  So is it fair to call this, you know, former ISIS propagandist warns the West?
[02:28:57.939 --> 02:29:00.280]  I mean, what should we call this interview when we put it on YouTube?
[02:29:01.909 --> 02:29:02.789]  We should.
[02:29:02.789 --> 02:29:05.411]  Wake up call.
[02:29:05.411 --> 02:29:10.435]  This is a call to action that ISIS is not just coming, they are here.
[02:29:10.435 --> 02:29:16.400]  The Muslim world is saying they are here and they will attack us.
[02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:21.584]  Yes, and you use the term that you used to be in what you'd call an Islamic State movement.
[02:29:21.584 --> 02:29:23.246]  So it's been around for decades and decades.
[02:29:24.121 --> 02:29:25.462]  Correct, correct.
[02:29:25.462 --> 02:29:30.064]  Yes, what you said, it's a great idea to call it as such.
[02:29:30.064 --> 02:29:34.466]  And however you need me in the future, I'll be there to serve you.
[02:29:34.466 --> 02:29:35.767]  Sir, thank you so much.
[02:29:35.767 --> 02:29:36.327]  God bless you.
[02:29:36.327 --> 02:29:38.408]  I look forward to speaking to you in the next week or two if you'll come on.
[02:29:38.408 --> 02:29:39.148]  Amazing.
[02:29:39.148 --> 02:29:39.969]  We'll be back, folks.
[02:29:39.969 --> 02:29:41.449]  That guy has a lot of courage.
[02:29:41.449 --> 02:29:41.890]  Believe me.
[02:29:41.890 --> 02:29:43.811]  I mean, he goes to the Middle East, they'll try to kill him.
[02:29:43.811 --> 02:29:44.491]  Amazing.
[02:29:44.491 --> 02:29:44.951]  Stay with us.
[02:29:44.951 --> 02:29:46.232]  I'm Alex Jones at fullwars.com.
[02:29:48.208 --> 02:29:52.141]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.141 --> 02:29:54.810]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.931 --> 02:30:02.952]  Uber admits it gave data on 12 million users to U.S.
[02:30:02.952 --> 02:30:03.372]  government.
[02:30:03.372 --> 02:30:08.373]  Ridesharing company admits to complying with roughly 85% of requests from law enforcement.
[02:30:08.373 --> 02:30:11.114]  Article up by Mikael Phelan at Infowars.com.
[02:30:11.114 --> 02:30:14.395]  Now according to the company's first ever transparency report, both U.S.
[02:30:14.395 --> 02:30:20.696]  law enforcement and regulators were provided with information on millions of users between July and December of 2015.
[02:30:20.696 --> 02:30:24.837]  We receive requests from law enforcement agencies for information about our riders.
[02:30:25.017 --> 02:30:35.603]  Requests from law enforcement agencies at both the state and federal level included information on everything from pickup and drop-off locations to the identity of specific drivers and passengers.
[02:30:35.603 --> 02:30:43.627]  None of the inquiries are believed to be related to national security since Uber did not receive any requests issued under the provisions of national security statutes.
[02:30:43.627 --> 02:30:49.931]  But in many cases they send blanket requests explaining why the information is needed or how it will be used, Uber wrote.
[02:30:50.111 --> 02:30:55.274]  While this kind of trip data doesn't include personal information, it can reveal patterns or behavior.
[02:30:55.274 --> 02:30:58.356]  You can find more reports like this at Infowars.com.
[02:31:07.381 --> 02:31:07.781]  We're good.
[02:31:28.698 --> 02:31:29.619]  Shower Filters.
[02:31:29.619 --> 02:31:31.340]  We're introducing the best yet.
[02:31:31.340 --> 02:31:35.404]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.
[02:31:35.404 --> 02:31:40.227]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.

[02:31:58.462 --> 02:32:04.965]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[02:32:04.965 --> 02:32:17.730]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, a bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[02:32:17.950 --> 02:32:21.614]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:32:21.614 --> 02:32:28.600]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:32:28.600 --> 02:32:41.472]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:32:41.472 --> 02:32:43.014]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:32:43.294 --> 02:32:49.683]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[02:32:49.683 --> 02:32:54.590]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:33:14.795 --> 02:33:18.496]  There must be some way out of here.
[02:33:18.496 --> 02:33:20.677]  Said the Joker to the thief.
[02:33:20.677 --> 02:33:22.237]  Too much confusion.
[02:33:22.237 --> 02:33:24.377]  There's too much confusion.
[02:33:24.377 --> 02:33:26.018]  I can't get no relief.
[02:33:26.018 --> 02:33:29.679]  I can't get no relief.
[02:33:29.679 --> 02:33:33.400]  Businessmen, they drink my wine.
[02:33:33.400 --> 02:33:37.301]  Clown men dig my earth.
[02:33:37.301 --> 02:33:40.802]  None of them are along the line.
[02:33:40.802 --> 02:33:42.122]  Nobody of it is mine.
[02:33:44.838 --> 02:33:48.524]  Bob Dylan bringing us in with All Along the Watchtower.
[02:33:48.524 --> 02:33:55.574]  I think Jimi Hendrix does it better, but didn't Dylan write this stuff?
[02:33:55.574 --> 02:33:55.935]  Good stuff.
[02:33:57.928 --> 02:33:59.309]  Chuck Andersey was nice enough to drive in.
[02:33:59.309 --> 02:34:02.331]  We were first having him on the phone, but we were like, wait a minute, he's only like 70 miles away.
[02:34:02.331 --> 02:34:02.851]  Let's get him in there.
[02:34:02.851 --> 02:34:03.952]  So he just got here.
[02:34:03.952 --> 02:34:04.853]  He's coming in.
[02:34:04.853 --> 02:34:11.417]  And I'm going to get he and his wife for at least 10, 15 minutes to pop in on the fourth hour when David Knight's hosting.
[02:34:11.417 --> 02:34:13.718]  David's got a big show lined up for you as well then.
[02:34:13.718 --> 02:34:17.861]  We'll also probably take something for the nightly news because I've seen the film.
[02:34:17.861 --> 02:34:18.882]  It's extremely powerful.
[02:34:20.091 --> 02:34:22.092]  It's RevelationTheMovie.info.
[02:34:22.092 --> 02:34:32.940]  You can get tickets right now to help it sell out this weekend, and then other theaters will pick it up, and then it's going to come out on Blu-ray, DVD, and we'll obviously get it on cable and things like that.
[02:34:32.940 --> 02:34:40.925]  Sixth Generation Texan with Family and American Revolution, commercial director, cameraman with over 20 years working in film, Director's Guild, retired Army officer.
[02:34:42.146 --> 02:34:56.476]  Uh, and retired to ranching, farming, horses in Texas Hill Country, lives off the grid, wood stoves, windmill, very rural, eight grandkids, married 36 years, um, to Anita, who's going to be on with the night as well, uh, and they produced Revelation.
[02:34:56.476 --> 02:35:01.439]  Christian, conservative, constitutional, nationalist, revelationthemovie.info.
[02:35:01.439 --> 02:35:04.942]  You can get tickets at revelationthemovie.info.
[02:35:06.289 --> 02:35:18.037]  And it's going to be showing, opening April 15th in Houston, in the Santicos Theaters, Richmond, Palladium, Tomball, Silverado.
[02:35:18.037 --> 02:35:19.498]  And it's in three theaters.
[02:35:19.498 --> 02:35:20.739]  You need to get down there.
[02:35:20.739 --> 02:35:26.784]  You need to drive down there if you're in South Texas, or in Louisiana, close to Houston, or in East Texas.
[02:35:26.784 --> 02:35:28.605]  No excuse you need to be there.
[02:35:28.605 --> 02:35:35.209]  Make sure when Chuck comes in there, he sent me to my phone, I'm sure he has a Twitter or Facebook,
[02:35:36.130 --> 02:35:41.137]  Great photos of Ron Paul at one of the private screenings this last weekend down in Houston.
[02:35:41.137 --> 02:35:42.839]  So, be part of this, folks.
[02:35:42.839 --> 02:35:49.507]  Let's play, there's a bunch of trailers, a couple trailers, but here's one of the trailers for Revelation, the newest one that came out last week.
[02:35:49.507 --> 02:35:50.909]  We've got some sneak peeks for you.
[02:35:56.932 --> 02:36:04.159]  First things I remember are frosty Carolina mornings with a cheery fire crackling in my mama's big black wood cook stove.
[02:36:04.159 --> 02:36:05.280]  I'm Charlie Daniels.
[02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:07.662]  Today, something's wrong.
[02:36:07.662 --> 02:36:08.583]  And we all know it.
[02:36:08.583 --> 02:36:12.006]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces.
[02:36:12.006 --> 02:36:12.847]  Boom!
[02:36:12.847 --> 02:36:15.649]  I got shot through the shoulder.
[02:36:15.649 --> 02:36:17.331]  My first thought was, damn, that hurts.
[02:36:19.204 --> 02:36:21.886]  Even Hollywood couldn't make up stuff like this.
[02:36:21.886 --> 02:36:28.250]  The people of the world are waiting for Americans to wake up!
[02:36:28.250 --> 02:36:34.654]  We, the people, have the right to keep and bear arms.
[02:36:34.654 --> 02:36:39.917]  The average citizen is photographed 300 times per day.
[02:36:39.917 --> 02:36:41.618]  Ah, the fancy ends right here.
[02:36:41.618 --> 02:36:47.902]  Beheadings, beatings, torturing, burning people in barrels.
[02:36:49.156 --> 02:36:53.498]  Is indicative, I think, of their confidence now that it doesn't matter if this is open.
[02:36:53.498 --> 02:36:55.819]  We have so much power here that they can't take us down.
[02:36:55.819 --> 02:37:00.781]  The biggest stumbling block to this plan is the United States of America.
[02:37:00.781 --> 02:37:01.802]  Why is that?
[02:37:01.802 --> 02:37:04.883]  Because we have a tradition of individual freedom and liberty.
[02:37:05.223 --> 02:37:11.208]  We have to protect America and the American way of life first.
[02:37:11.208 --> 02:37:13.490]  World government is only the beginning.
[02:37:13.490 --> 02:37:15.471]  The caucus crowed, friends.
[02:37:15.471 --> 02:37:16.892]  Denial will not stand.
[02:37:16.892 --> 02:37:22.837]  Once they have control, they plan on absolutely dehumanizing humanity.
[02:37:24.602 --> 02:37:32.149]  Chuck Undersea is right here in studio and he and his wife are going to both be back in for part of the next hour.
[02:37:32.149 --> 02:37:33.230]  And there's Charlie Daniels.
[02:37:33.230 --> 02:37:38.335]  I'm like cutting into him because the trailer actually continues on there at the end.
[02:37:38.335 --> 02:37:42.219]  But again, Chuck Undersea is right here in studio with us right now.
[02:37:42.219 --> 02:37:44.220]  If you go to revelationthemovie.info
[02:37:44.901 --> 02:37:47.122]  I know on radio that sounded like a powerful trailer.
[02:37:47.122 --> 02:37:48.243]  You gotta see it.
[02:37:48.243 --> 02:37:50.444]  Because that's really what you're a master of, is cinematography.
[02:37:50.444 --> 02:37:51.785]  That's what you did.
[02:37:51.785 --> 02:37:53.866]  Then you retired, came out of retirement.
[02:37:53.866 --> 02:37:58.729]  You've done some of the biggest cinematography out there for TV shows, movies, famous commercials.
[02:37:58.729 --> 02:38:05.653]  But I tell you, the cinematography on this is even better than a Michael Moore film, which isn't that good, or even a Dinesh D'Souza.
[02:38:05.653 --> 02:38:07.834]  This looks better than PBS.
[02:38:07.834 --> 02:38:10.195]  So you even made my fat butt look pretty good.
[02:38:10.195 --> 02:38:10.876]  So great job, sir.
[02:38:11.576 --> 02:38:12.356]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:38:12.356 --> 02:38:13.997]  Glad to be with the tip of the spear today.
[02:38:13.997 --> 02:38:14.637]  Oh, no, no.
[02:38:14.637 --> 02:38:15.718]  You're the tip of the spear.
[02:38:15.718 --> 02:38:18.279]  I tell you, this film deserves to be in every theater in the country.
[02:38:18.279 --> 02:38:20.460]  That's really up to viewers and listeners out there.
[02:38:20.460 --> 02:38:21.340]  Tell us about the film.
[02:38:21.340 --> 02:38:22.981]  I'm going to go through some clips of it.
[02:38:22.981 --> 02:38:24.101]  Break down why it's so important.
[02:38:25.168 --> 02:38:30.670]  Well, first of all, we feel it's really critical that everyone do their part.
[02:38:30.670 --> 02:38:35.372]  And so many people, everyone has a gift, and it just happened to be that ours was filmmaking.
[02:38:35.372 --> 02:38:42.534]  And an old preacher once told me in East Texas that be careful of what you ask God for, because you may not like the answer.
[02:38:42.534 --> 02:38:44.795]  And when we started this over five years ago,
[02:38:45.895 --> 02:38:49.358]  We thought, you know, this will take a year and a half, be a typical film.
[02:38:49.358 --> 02:38:53.201]  But we got more and more access and sort of raised the money as we went.
[02:38:53.201 --> 02:38:55.022]  And one thing led to another.
[02:38:55.022 --> 02:39:05.710]  We were contacted by the distributor for 2016 because it's extremely difficult, virtually impossible to get a documentary in theaters.
[02:39:05.710 --> 02:39:09.773]  And since they had such a success in 2016, they called us and said, hey, would you like to do this?
[02:39:09.773 --> 02:39:13.976]  And we had started this film as Behold a Pale Horse.
[02:39:14.856 --> 02:39:20.267]  And then they said, well, this has been out on DVD, so you have to retitle and completely redo the film.
[02:39:20.267 --> 02:39:20.708]  So we did.
[02:39:20.708 --> 02:39:21.830]  We shot a lot of new stuff.
[02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:23.033]  It's a very different film.
[02:39:23.033 --> 02:39:26.119]  It was great before, but now it's like beyond HBO.
[02:39:27.782 --> 02:39:41.187]  Well, we feel that it's a perfect storm at this time because of the election, because it has nothing to do with the election, but what it does have to do with is people are so... And that's how Providence works.
[02:39:41.187 --> 02:39:44.668]  This would have been out two, three years ago, but now it just waited until the right time.
[02:39:45.228 --> 02:39:48.230]  We've often thought that because we were so frustrated two years ago.
[02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:51.152]  We thought that we've been doing this for three years.
[02:39:51.152 --> 02:39:52.253]  We need to get on with it.
[02:39:52.253 --> 02:39:53.394]  You know, let's get it out.
[02:39:53.394 --> 02:39:55.535]  And just one thing after another happened.
[02:39:55.535 --> 02:40:02.120]  And Providence has been involved at every level because, again, it's impossible to get a film like this in theaters.
[02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:04.041]  And and we did it.
[02:40:04.041 --> 02:40:08.644]  And the big issue is Americans are trained like Pavlov's dogs to
[02:40:09.685 --> 02:40:26.604]  to pay attention to celebrity to pay attention anything on TV and theaters and so all this information obviously you've been doing for years everything in the film you gotta make it sensational that it's in theaters and it's that's what gives the mystique to make people pay attention that's the whole point the theater factor and uh...
[02:40:27.345 --> 02:40:40.217]  And to the patriot, these issues are on the table, but to those thousands of people that are still clueless, still think they live... Oh yeah, let's not forget that just because maybe 20-30% of the country knows what's going on, most other people don't, but they're ready to learn.
[02:40:41.209 --> 02:40:58.597]  Yeah, and our point here with this is all the patriots who do know can be Paul Reveres to what I call the gray people, what you would have called at one time the regular red-blooded Americans who know something's wrong but can't quite put their finger on it.
[02:40:58.597 --> 02:41:05.741]  So if your audience, the patriot community, will go out and be Paul Reveres to use this as a tool... Because they're the tip of the spear!
[02:41:05.741 --> 02:41:05.981]  Right.
[02:41:05.981 --> 02:41:07.161]  People say, I'm the tip of the spear.
[02:41:07.161 --> 02:41:09.082]  No, no, this audience is really the muscle.
[02:41:09.082 --> 02:41:10.183]  They're the ones on the ground.
[02:41:11.001 --> 02:41:17.802]  Well, I hate to use the word collective, but the collective voice of patriots can come together and make a difference.
[02:41:17.802 --> 02:41:25.223]  And like you were talking about earlier on the show, that there is a time coming where push is going to come to shove and people have to decide where they stand.
[02:41:25.223 --> 02:41:28.264]  They're wanting to put Joel Gilbert in jail, the Federal Election Commission.
[02:41:28.264 --> 02:41:30.244]  They arrested a national citizen.
[02:41:30.244 --> 02:41:39.466]  It would actually be tremendous if we did not have to endure what they are, but we've made the decision that we had to do what we had to do, and this is what we're doing.
[02:41:40.100 --> 02:41:44.902]  Well, the good news is, for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction in Newtonian physics.
[02:41:44.902 --> 02:41:46.143]  People are upset.
[02:41:46.143 --> 02:42:00.129]  And people in government, I've never... Folks always say we're anti-government, I'm anti-unconstitutional government, but on average, the most awake group I find now are police, military, but even bureaucrats, now on the inside of this, realize, man, we've got a scary elite running things.
[02:42:00.129 --> 02:42:04.932]  There's not even law anymore, it's just multinationals, like the TPP, telling us what to do.
[02:42:05.950 --> 02:42:16.680]  You know, if you really cut to the chase, it astounds me, having grown up in East Texas and Norman Rockwell America, that, in fact, there are so many traitors in our midst.
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:23.647]  And, you know, if I had to be labeled, it would be American nationalists.
[02:42:23.647 --> 02:42:25.309]  I feel... You're loyalist to America!
[02:42:25.929 --> 02:42:27.131]  Yeah, I was an army officer.
[02:42:27.131 --> 02:42:29.453]  I swore an oath to the Constitution.
[02:42:29.453 --> 02:42:37.220]  I feel that America first, and I think that the whole global thing is incomprehensible.
[02:42:37.220 --> 02:42:45.228]  When, you know, as Christians, we're charged with having empathy for anyone, everyone, and we are Christian.
[02:42:45.228 --> 02:42:50.153]  However, as Americans, I don't feel that we owe the world a free ride, and I think that
[02:42:50.413 --> 02:42:51.514]  Well, plus we're being sold out.
[02:42:51.514 --> 02:42:55.397]  I mean, they sell globalism like we're trying to help people, but really it's enslaving them.
[02:42:55.397 --> 02:42:57.299]  That's all come out in their own documents.
[02:42:57.299 --> 02:42:59.761]  The film itself, so many clips from it.
[02:42:59.761 --> 02:43:02.563]  Some of these are exclusive today for folks that just tuned in.
[02:43:02.563 --> 02:43:14.333]  But before we go through some of these clips and have you introduce them, Chuck Huntersley, the director of the new film, RevelationTheMovie.info, to get tickets and to find out the theaters in Houston, break down what the film grew into and who's in it.
[02:43:14.333 --> 02:43:18.196]  Because I tell you, I've never seen, like Ted Nugent,
[02:43:19.389 --> 02:43:22.133]  With it look this good or him sound this good?
[02:43:22.133 --> 02:43:23.696]  He always sounds great.
[02:43:23.696 --> 02:43:31.208]  I mean, it's just everybody in the film just really explodes off the screen what they say, the footage you've got, all the different things that happen.
[02:43:31.208 --> 02:43:32.089]  I mean, wow.
[02:43:32.089 --> 02:43:33.011]  Five years in the making.
[02:43:33.993 --> 02:43:44.600]  Well, it was something of an unorthodox film project, in that normal films, especially long-form film, you have a script, you shoot the script, you evolve it, how it unfolds.
[02:43:44.600 --> 02:43:51.806]  However, in this case, the only part that's scripted is what Charlie did, and he did a fantastic job, he's a consummate pro.
[02:43:51.806 --> 02:44:00.712]  The problem is, with people like General Boykin, or yourself, or other people, you don't sit them down and try and instruct them on what to say, you know what you're saying, you need to say so.
[02:44:01.192 --> 02:44:11.796]  We had some 42 people that are rock stars in the patriot community in this film, and we, how I structured it was pick various people who knew issues, knew of issues.
[02:44:11.796 --> 02:44:18.959]  Geverard Griffin, General Boykin about communism, Marxism, socialism, where we're going.
[02:44:18.959 --> 02:44:22.420]  You about the New World Order, you get the people that know their issues, and then you
[02:44:23.180 --> 02:44:29.944]  You place them in areas so it complements the previous person and that's why it took eight months to edit.
[02:44:29.944 --> 02:44:43.073]  But the point is it unfolded like that and I think Providence has been in this at every turn because it's an incomprehensible task to take 45 hours of footage and turn it into a meaningful hour and 40 minutes for the commercial film.
[02:44:43.433 --> 02:44:46.094]  Well, if people are looking for a weapon to fight the globalists, this is it.
[02:44:46.094 --> 02:44:50.655]  And we obviously need to get it to be sold out all this weekend and through next week at these theaters.
[02:44:50.655 --> 02:44:52.196]  Then other theaters will get it.
[02:44:52.196 --> 02:44:53.876]  Then we'll get on air and talk about those.
[02:44:53.876 --> 02:44:55.157]  You can see it in your area.
[02:44:55.157 --> 02:44:56.177]  It's like a game.
[02:44:56.177 --> 02:44:58.098]  And I've done this with other films before.
[02:44:58.098 --> 02:44:59.298]  And our audience has.
[02:44:59.298 --> 02:45:00.839]  And then it can get on hundreds of screens.
[02:45:00.839 --> 02:45:01.579]  If it gets on hundreds...
[02:45:02.259 --> 02:45:04.742]  Look, if it does well on three or four screens, it gets on dozens.
[02:45:04.742 --> 02:45:07.265]  If it does well on dozens, it gets on hundreds.
[02:45:07.265 --> 02:45:10.228]  If it gets on hundreds and does well, it goes on thousands.
[02:45:10.228 --> 02:45:11.890]  Then it can change the country.
[02:45:11.890 --> 02:45:16.856]  And as good as 2016 was, this is light years ahead of that on how hardcore it is.
[02:45:16.856 --> 02:45:20.160]  It needs to be seen on hundreds of screens and bare minimum.
[02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:22.342]  Then DVD, Blu-ray, people see it.
[02:45:23.383 --> 02:45:25.165]  I'll get you in touch with Chuck Norris.
[02:45:25.165 --> 02:45:26.326]  I'm sure you already are.
[02:45:26.326 --> 02:45:27.727]  Or Mike Norris has the contacts.
[02:45:27.727 --> 02:45:29.048]  Put it on cable TV.
[02:45:29.048 --> 02:45:30.429]  I'm sure your guys do.
[02:45:30.429 --> 02:45:32.731]  Get it on national TV for people to see.
[02:45:32.731 --> 02:45:35.133]  Because this is about waking the country up.
[02:45:35.133 --> 02:45:37.035]  And again, the minds are ready.
[02:45:37.035 --> 02:45:38.776]  You plant in the springtime.
[02:45:38.776 --> 02:45:41.799]  This is the springtime of the mind opening up.
[02:45:41.799 --> 02:45:46.683]  It's never been easier to get people to shift their thinking and just see what's happening.
[02:45:46.683 --> 02:45:48.424]  Because I don't tell people what to think.
[02:45:48.424 --> 02:45:49.926]  I get them to take the blinders off.
[02:45:50.646 --> 02:45:55.328]  And I'm telling you, the blinders are coming off, and films like this are game changers, Chuck.
[02:45:55.328 --> 02:46:06.453]  You know, we've, just this week, the war for this has always been to get past the Houston opening, which takes, frankly, millions of dollars in advertising, to get it in the national marketplace.
[02:46:06.453 --> 02:46:15.798]  And so we now have just had, in the last few days, a tremendous opening, and we have our national, what they call P&A funding in place, and it will go national.
[02:46:16.238 --> 02:46:17.219]  Oh, I didn't know that happened.
[02:46:17.219 --> 02:46:19.000]  I thought we were trying to go, that's wonderful news.
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.402]  That'll be 2,000 to 3,000 theaters around the country.
[02:46:21.402 --> 02:46:24.364]  And it still has to do well in Houston to consummate that.
[02:46:24.364 --> 02:46:28.347]  And that's why opening weekend on any film is critical this weekend.
[02:46:28.347 --> 02:46:30.269]  Tell folks the theaters, they've got to go.
[02:46:30.269 --> 02:46:38.275]  It opens this weekend, Friday, Saturday, Sunday in Houston at the Santicos Chain Theaters, one in Richmond, one in Tombaugh.
[02:46:38.695 --> 02:46:42.297]  The one in Richmond is called the Palladium, the one in Tombaugh is called the Silverado.
[02:46:42.297 --> 02:46:54.124]  The reason the distributor chose, who also did 2016, chose to open in those two theaters is they were the biggest or the highest grossing box office for 2016 because of the conservative area in Houston.
[02:46:54.124 --> 02:46:56.885]  And so he opened us in that area.
[02:46:56.885 --> 02:47:01.448]  And we already have sold out four or five screenings for this weekend.
[02:47:01.448 --> 02:47:04.129]  We need to do more, but we've advertised and
[02:47:06.350 --> 02:47:11.294]  Bored and stolen, all kinds of promotion, and I think we should have a really good response.
[02:47:11.294 --> 02:47:16.817]  However, anyone in Houston, go this weekend, because box office for the opening weekend is... Sure.
[02:47:16.817 --> 02:47:20.940]  And then there's also moves to get it in art houses after that, and the film will have a long life.
[02:47:20.940 --> 02:47:24.202]  And hopefully another film, you've got 45 hours of footage.
[02:47:24.202 --> 02:47:25.323]  But this is so exciting.
[02:47:25.763 --> 02:47:29.166]  Now the film just lays out in a continuum really what's happening.
[02:47:29.166 --> 02:47:35.010]  It's extremely powerful, great for experts, great for newcomers, I mean a serious weapon against the globalists.
[02:47:35.010 --> 02:47:36.552]  Let's play some of these clips.
[02:47:36.552 --> 02:47:43.097]  Let's play this clip with General Boykin first, a short clip talking about society moving towards Marxism.
[02:47:43.097 --> 02:47:45.419]  Notice they laugh and say communism doesn't exist.
[02:47:45.979 --> 02:48:02.174]  When 1.3 billion people, or 1.4 billion are under it in China, when our president's going to Cuba standing below Che Guevara, he's going to Argentina saying this is a great thing, this is what the globalists want because they're exempt from it, but get the slaves.
[02:48:02.174 --> 02:48:09.380]  So here's the former head of special forces, founder of Delta Force, General Boykin, talking about what's happening with society.
[02:48:09.380 --> 02:48:12.003]  Whether we recognize it or not as Americans,
[02:48:13.115 --> 02:48:28.723]  Our society is moving towards Marxism.
[02:48:28.723 --> 02:48:29.543]  April 15th.
[02:48:29.543 --> 02:48:31.704]  Wake up, America.
[02:48:31.704 --> 02:48:34.365]  RevelationTheMovie.info.
[02:48:34.365 --> 02:48:35.466]  Rated PG.
[02:48:35.466 --> 02:48:36.246]  That's right, folks.
[02:48:36.246 --> 02:48:37.747]  Let's go ahead and go to another clip here.
[02:48:37.747 --> 02:48:39.728]  Let's go to another clip of General Boykin's soldiers.
[02:48:41.311 --> 02:48:42.753]  Consider future threats.
[02:48:42.753 --> 02:48:44.757]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[02:48:44.757 --> 02:48:52.290]  The young men and women that are serving our nation today are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan and other places in the world.
[02:48:52.290 --> 02:48:55.134]  And they are declared to be future threats to America.
[02:49:06.565 --> 02:49:10.526]  And again, those are just little short clips that I hope to work with you.
[02:49:10.526 --> 02:49:15.467]  We want to take them and put together a trailer with some of Charlie Daniels' songs, the whole lapel horse.
[02:49:15.467 --> 02:49:16.748]  That'd be great.
[02:49:16.748 --> 02:49:20.248]  We can put out in the next few days if you want to try to promote folks going to Houston, we'll point them at your website.
[02:49:20.248 --> 02:49:21.009]  That'd be wonderful.
[02:49:21.009 --> 02:49:28.711]  I want to mention that General Boykin, like I said, I was an Army officer, I retired, and I spent 10 years at the Pentagon and off and on.
[02:49:28.711 --> 02:49:29.871]  And there are generals,
[02:49:30.791 --> 02:49:32.151]  And there's General Boykin.
[02:49:32.151 --> 02:49:38.913]  And General Boykin, if you read his book, Never Surrender, he was one of the founding members of Delta Force, commander of all special forces.
[02:49:38.913 --> 02:49:44.134]  He was the commander on the ground in Mogadishu in that event which became the movie Black Hawk Down.
[02:49:44.134 --> 02:49:45.574]  He's been shot up a bunch himself.
[02:49:45.574 --> 02:49:49.355]  He was hit with a 50 round in Grenada.
[02:49:49.355 --> 02:49:50.475]  He captured Noriega.
[02:49:50.475 --> 02:49:52.376]  He went in with special operations people.
[02:49:53.436 --> 02:49:57.060]  When they got Pablo Escobar, I mean, the man is John Wayne.
[02:49:57.060 --> 02:50:06.431]  And he came and spoke a week ago at our premiere in Houston where we had 300 people, Ron Paul came, and he is riveting.
[02:50:06.431 --> 02:50:07.872]  I should have sent a camera crew down there.
[02:50:08.573 --> 02:50:09.314]  I just get so busy.
[02:50:09.314 --> 02:50:10.735]  You've got to start making me do this stuff.
[02:50:10.735 --> 02:50:11.095]  I'll tell you.
[02:50:11.095 --> 02:50:11.675]  We'll do it again.
[02:50:11.675 --> 02:50:13.216]  I know you were inviting me down there, but I forgot.
[02:50:13.216 --> 02:50:14.597]  I mean, wow, we should have gone and interviewed him down there.
[02:50:14.597 --> 02:50:15.157]  That's amazing.
[02:50:15.157 --> 02:50:17.279]  Well, we want to do it here, too, so... Well, good.
[02:50:17.279 --> 02:50:19.060]  I'll come to that one, definitely.
[02:50:19.060 --> 02:50:19.881]  I just like to hide.
[02:50:19.881 --> 02:50:21.221]  I don't... I mean, I'm not afraid of crowds.
[02:50:21.221 --> 02:50:23.063]  I just kind of don't like the crowds.
[02:50:23.063 --> 02:50:26.245]  But it's fun stuff to do.
[02:50:26.245 --> 02:50:27.145]  We're about to go to break.
[02:50:27.145 --> 02:50:29.967]  We've got... We've already played the audience screener reaction, Little Boy.
[02:50:29.967 --> 02:50:33.730]  Learned about the new... We've got a clip of old Alex Jones there, but we're not going to play that one.
[02:50:33.730 --> 02:50:37.873]  There are a bunch of the clips up on the website, revelationthemovie.info.
[02:50:39.054 --> 02:50:42.697]  Go there if you're in East Texas or South Texas, the Houston area.
[02:50:42.697 --> 02:50:47.722]  They got to sell out every showing and then they'll just start booking it more and more theaters.
[02:50:47.722 --> 02:50:54.128]  The promoters will put the money up to do it and then we launch this thing and it's another big victory against the globalists.
[02:50:54.128 --> 02:50:55.950]  I'm Alex Jones here with Chuck Undersea.
[02:50:55.950 --> 02:50:58.733]  He'll be in popping in in the next hour as well in the fourth hour.
[02:51:02.005 --> 02:51:08.148]  December 7, 1941, a date which will live in infamy.
[02:51:08.148 --> 02:51:09.729]  Remember Pearl Harbor.

[02:54:00.986 --> 02:54:17.878]  Alright, I'm doing this segment and one more with Chuck Anderseen, then two segments with David Knight breaking down news and analysis, and then he and his wife, who's a producer and worked heavily on the film, Great Lady, they're going to be back in studio with David Knight and take your calls about the film.
[02:54:17.878 --> 02:54:20.520]  So fourth hour, a lot of stations picking it up now.
[02:54:20.520 --> 02:54:22.221]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:54:22.221 --> 02:54:23.642]  You can always find the video feeds.
[02:54:24.603 --> 02:54:28.710]  The free podcast, the free iPhone and Droid apps and more.
[02:54:28.710 --> 02:54:32.777]  I've been barely even plugging today and I should because that's how I fund this operation myself.
[02:54:32.777 --> 02:54:34.961]  We have great nutraceuticals at Infowarslife.com.
[02:54:36.479 --> 02:54:46.706]  We have 25% off Brain Force, the ultimate for the price, nootropic, nootroceutical, that naturally helps boost brain function and so much more.
[02:54:46.706 --> 02:54:49.047]  Go read the facts about the things that are in it.
[02:54:49.047 --> 02:54:51.209]  Very safe, very, very effective.
[02:54:51.209 --> 02:54:52.369]  And it says 25% off.
[02:54:52.369 --> 02:54:54.451]  That's 25% off the discounted rate.
[02:54:55.331 --> 02:55:08.335]  We're not really promoting this right, because it's normally $39, and then that's retail, and then like $29 when it is regular sales price at $22, folks.
[02:55:08.335 --> 02:55:09.656]  That is amazing.
[02:55:09.656 --> 02:55:15.638]  When you find out what's in it, go research it for yourself, buy a bottle, try it out, read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[02:55:16.764 --> 02:55:18.425]  And know you're supporting the broadcast.
[02:55:18.425 --> 02:55:21.186]  That's how we fund the InfoWars News Center.
[02:55:21.186 --> 02:55:37.453]  It's going to have our reporters tomorrow at the Trump rally in New York, where they're promising to shut it down, at the demonstration in Colorado on Friday, dealing with the attempt to shut all of that down, where they're saying no free speech is allowed at Portland State.
[02:55:37.453 --> 02:55:44.836]  And then, of course, also they're going to be just absolutely exposing how the left is trying to shut down free speech.
[02:55:44.836 --> 02:55:45.657]  So, again, New York.
[02:55:46.557 --> 02:55:46.998]  Thank you.
[02:56:09.218 --> 02:56:12.840]  But it takes money to win a war, and believe me, we've got the initiative going.
[02:56:12.840 --> 02:56:18.204]  Speaking of winning a war, revelationthemovie.info, you can go there right now with your Fandango account.
[02:56:18.204 --> 02:56:19.685]  A lot of you already have one of those.
[02:56:19.685 --> 02:56:21.025]  It's got Fandango.
[02:56:21.025 --> 02:56:23.847]  It's got just, I'm talking 30 seconds.
[02:56:23.847 --> 02:56:25.908]  I can buy movie tickets quick myself, I've done it plenty.
[02:56:25.908 --> 02:56:29.551]  I don't watch a lot of TV, but I do see a movie every couple weeks, so I'm good at that.
[02:56:30.251 --> 02:56:33.655]  And I'm telling you, I can sign up on this site in 60 seconds max.
[02:56:33.655 --> 02:56:42.365]  So go there, boom, buy your tickets, the theater, the maps, where it's at, it's on Fandango, links at the site, revelationofmovie.info.
[02:56:42.365 --> 02:56:49.252]  This is a place where you can see a great film, have a family outing, take your kids, your neighbors, educate them, bring some people to the film.
[02:56:49.913 --> 02:56:54.856]  Make it, again, The War is Fun to Fight, the animating contest of Liberty.
[02:56:54.856 --> 02:57:02.301]  Chuck Andersey, the director, he'll be back in about 35 minutes from now with your wife, but other points you'd like to add about the film, and also the state of the world.
[02:57:02.301 --> 02:57:06.064]  I mean, it's not hard to wake people up when tyranny's getting so naked.
[02:57:06.064 --> 02:57:07.945]  Why do you think it's getting so out in the open?
[02:57:08.976 --> 02:57:10.337]  I think it's spiritual warfare.
[02:57:10.337 --> 02:57:14.121]  I think what we're seeing is the evolution of Daniel and Revelation.
[02:57:14.121 --> 02:57:25.191]  I think that the agenda in Europe, the agenda with the open border here, the sleeper cells, is a Trojan horse which will be the final climactic battle.
[02:57:25.191 --> 02:57:31.898]  I think that, and we're all charged as Christians with fighting tyranny, so we have to make a choice.
[02:57:33.396 --> 02:57:42.263]  Everybody I talk to says it's pretty empowering to be off the grid, but then they also go into an office and are on the grid, but they separate it.
[02:57:42.263 --> 02:57:44.505]  Be in the world, but not of it.
[02:57:44.505 --> 02:57:47.888]  We're in Babylon, but we're not being part of Babylon or trying not to.
[02:57:47.888 --> 02:57:51.711]  Is it empowering to be off the grid and then also be able to separately fight the tyranny?
[02:57:53.021 --> 02:57:56.023]  It's kind of a long story for us, but a real simple concept.
[02:57:56.023 --> 02:57:57.083]  We lived in L.A.
[02:57:57.083 --> 02:57:59.965]  working in the film business for 20 years, over 20 years.
[02:57:59.965 --> 02:58:00.705]  And L.A.
[02:58:00.705 --> 02:58:03.987]  is hectic, to say the least.
[02:58:03.987 --> 02:58:13.032]  And when we came back here, I'm from East Texas, and we came back about six or seven years ago, I wanted to not see any neighbors, no lights, no wires, no nothing.
[02:58:13.032 --> 02:58:16.814]  And of course, I was aware of the whole smart meter thing.
[02:58:16.814 --> 02:58:18.535]  And so we went off the grid totally.
[02:58:18.535 --> 02:58:19.896]  We're not plugged in at all.
[02:58:19.896 --> 02:58:21.997]  We have wood stoves for heat, windmill for water.
[02:58:22.877 --> 02:58:25.358]  I had written a Civil War film, and I was really into it.
[02:58:25.358 --> 02:58:31.059]  In fact, the first year we used kerosene light because it was historically fun, but then we evolved into it.
[02:58:31.059 --> 02:58:32.139]  Was it empowering?
[02:58:32.139 --> 02:58:32.760]  It was wonderful.
[02:58:32.760 --> 02:58:33.940]  You're a pretty empowered guy.
[02:58:33.940 --> 02:58:35.500]  Back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:35.500 --> 02:58:37.761]  Making award-winning films, living off the grid.
[02:58:37.761 --> 02:58:39.721]  I love that fusion, folks.
[02:58:39.721 --> 02:58:41.962]  And we're in the world, but not of it, folks.
[02:58:41.962 --> 02:58:43.062]  I'm telling you.
[02:58:43.062 --> 02:58:43.743]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:48.900 --> 02:58:49.560]  Uh, yeah.
[02:58:49.560 --> 02:58:51.641]  First of all, I want to say, take the 12.
[02:58:51.641 --> 02:58:52.401]  That's two.
[02:58:52.401 --> 02:58:55.381]  Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[02:58:55.381 --> 02:58:56.341]  I use them all.
[02:58:56.341 --> 02:58:57.322]  They're phenomenal.
[02:58:57.322 --> 02:58:58.062]  They work.
[02:58:58.062 --> 02:58:58.902]  Buy them, folks.
[02:58:58.902 --> 02:58:59.302]  Thank you, brother.
[02:58:59.302 --> 02:59:01.302]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[02:59:01.302 --> 02:59:07.524]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[02:59:07.524 --> 02:59:09.524]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[02:59:09.524 --> 02:59:14.925]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[02:59:15.245 --> 02:59:16.086]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[02:59:16.086 --> 02:59:19.988]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, AcuFX, uh, nascent iodine.
[02:59:19.988 --> 02:59:20.769]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:59:20.769 --> 02:59:21.829]  Have they worked for you?
[02:59:21.829 --> 02:59:24.671]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[02:59:24.671 --> 02:59:25.992]  What products are you taking?
[02:59:25.992 --> 02:59:32.036]  Everything from, uh, Supermail to, uh, Brain Force to Winter Sun, uh, X2.
[02:59:32.036 --> 02:59:34.037]  Even got a little, uh, DNA Force.
[02:59:34.037 --> 02:59:37.539]  So, and I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[02:59:37.659 --> 02:59:42.702]  Visit Infowarslives.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.

[02:59:44.263 --> 02:59:45.523]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:08.775 --> 03:00:11.458]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:11.458 --> 03:00:16.605]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:00:22.800 --> 03:00:27.965]  Alright, final segment that I'm hosting with David Knight coming in to honcho the operation.
[03:00:27.965 --> 03:00:29.386]  A bunch of breaking news.
[03:00:29.386 --> 03:00:30.087]  Look at this.
[03:00:30.087 --> 03:00:31.669]  Infowars.com.
[03:00:31.669 --> 03:00:34.731]  Howard Stern has come out and said we have a right to defend ourselves.
[03:00:34.731 --> 03:00:35.792]  He believes in the Second Amendment.
[03:00:35.792 --> 03:00:38.155]  He's saying, well he's nasty and uses cuss words.
[03:00:38.155 --> 03:00:39.216]  It's not about that.
[03:00:39.216 --> 03:00:41.378]  If we can win over Howard Stern, folks, we're winning.
[03:00:41.838 --> 03:00:45.622]  So when I tell you we're winning, the statistics show it, the numbers show it.
[03:00:45.622 --> 03:00:48.264]  The problem is the top echelons have been hijacked.
[03:00:48.264 --> 03:00:56.071]  So Chuck, where do you see the world going in the next few years where we're winning at the grassroots, incrementally, but the enemy knows that so they're racing to show it all up?
[03:00:56.860 --> 03:01:03.726]  Well, again, bringing it back to the spiritual warfare, no man knows the hour and the day, but I feel it's very, very close.
[03:01:03.726 --> 03:01:25.684]  And some of the people we've been dealing with, we've had access to amazing people, not only ones in the film, but particularly a person in Houston who is an elderly man who's been involved in all these issues for 60 years, and he feels very strongly that we're going down a path that is going to climax soon.
[03:01:27.020 --> 03:01:36.469]  I've got to hand it to all the Patriots, all the Antoinette Lorder folks from 60 years ago, Barry Goldwater, all of them, and the fellow that runs the TV station down there in Houston, I think we're talking about the same guy.
[03:01:36.469 --> 03:01:37.350]  They were really right.
[03:01:37.350 --> 03:01:39.032]  If it wasn't for them, we'd be caught flat-footed.
[03:01:40.342 --> 03:01:44.703]  I think that I'm an optimist by nature, and I think that there's always hope.
[03:01:44.703 --> 03:01:56.407]  I think that, you know, in the Old Testament, continually old Israel was brought back to faith and to a change, and I think that's possible.
[03:01:56.407 --> 03:02:02.609]  But I mean, as Charlie Daniels says in the film, we've all read the book, we know how it ends, and we win.
[03:02:02.609 --> 03:02:07.371]  So it may not be exactly the way we want, but it's unfolding and it's happening fast.
[03:02:07.711 --> 03:02:11.254]  Anybody that sits around and says they're bored, they must not have their eyes open.
[03:02:11.254 --> 03:02:16.699]  This is, quite frankly, I don't like the bad stuff that's happening, also good stuff's happening, but it's pretty darn exciting.
[03:02:16.699 --> 03:02:19.181]  I mean, I'm not bored, I'll tell you that.
[03:02:19.181 --> 03:02:33.594]  I've often heard you say, what an amazing time to be alive, and even though it's really frightening, the things that are going on, and it's going to be a ride, I think that it is an amazing time to be alive, and I think people that don't see this
[03:02:34.295 --> 03:02:39.118]  Or are missing the most important turning point in human history?
[03:02:39.118 --> 03:02:44.461]  Well, I want to have you back for a full hour sometime just to talk about what it's like to live off the grid.
[03:02:44.461 --> 03:02:52.345]  Maybe send, I don't want to get in your privacy, I don't want to see where you live, but maybe send a crew out and kind of show how it is to live off the grid because I want to get to where part of the time I'm off the grid.
[03:02:52.345 --> 03:02:57.348]  It's so healthy, all the electricity, all the wires, all the chatter, the dust.
[03:02:57.348 --> 03:02:59.009]  You know, the big city is not a healthy place to live.
[03:03:00.098 --> 03:03:06.403]  We've recently spent a lot of time in Houston in the last six weeks of promoting and preparing for this release.
[03:03:06.403 --> 03:03:08.744]  And of course, I've lived in L.A.
[03:03:08.744 --> 03:03:10.065]  for 23 years.
[03:03:10.065 --> 03:03:15.389]  And I get very claustrophobic every time I even come to Austin.
[03:03:15.389 --> 03:03:17.071]  Oh, man, I tell you.
[03:03:17.071 --> 03:03:18.472]  That's how I describe Houston.
[03:03:18.472 --> 03:03:19.452]  I'm not used to L.A.
[03:03:19.452 --> 03:03:21.334]  I get claustrophobic in L.A.
[03:03:21.334 --> 03:03:24.156]  Yeah, if you send a crew out, they'll have to bring a horse.
[03:03:26.358 --> 03:03:28.079]  Well, listen, I want to come out and see your place sometime.
[03:03:28.079 --> 03:03:28.859]  I know you've invited me.
[03:03:28.859 --> 03:03:34.824]  What are you going to talk about with your wife, the producer, when you guys come back in about 20 minutes with David Knight?
[03:03:34.824 --> 03:03:36.525]  She brings a feminine touch to it.
[03:03:36.525 --> 03:03:44.191]  We have eight grandkids, and her father was a major war hero in World War II, and we both, all in the family.
[03:03:44.191 --> 03:03:48.935]  My family's been in Texas for six generations, since the Texas Revolution, like yours.
[03:03:49.495 --> 03:03:53.659]  And in Virginia and the Carolinas since the American Revolution.
[03:03:53.659 --> 03:03:54.680]  I want to mention something.
[03:03:54.680 --> 03:03:59.564]  My father came from Switzerland, on my father's side, in the 20s.
[03:03:59.564 --> 03:04:13.956]  And he told me, I'll never forget this story, he told me that when the ship came into New York Harbor and they were passing the Statue of Liberty, 1,500 immigrants came to the starboard side of the ship and the crew was nervous because it started tilting and they made them separate.
[03:04:13.956 --> 03:04:16.318]  But when they did and they passed the Statue of Liberty,
[03:04:16.838 --> 03:04:19.620]  They, they were, there wasn't a dry eye in the crowd.
[03:04:19.620 --> 03:04:21.421]  And when they came here, they assimilated.
[03:04:21.421 --> 03:04:26.425]  They wouldn't, they wouldn't, my grandfather wouldn't let the family speak German at home.
[03:04:26.425 --> 03:04:28.787]  And they worked their way up and they lived the American dream.
[03:04:28.787 --> 03:04:32.409]  And, you know, America's always been multicultural from the beginning.
[03:04:32.409 --> 03:04:37.793]  But the multicultural of today, where they want islands of, of wherever they came from.
[03:04:37.793 --> 03:04:38.834]  It's gang mentality.
[03:04:38.834 --> 03:04:40.295]  It's not, it's not assimilation.
[03:04:40.515 --> 03:04:42.056]  And it's the end.
[03:04:42.056 --> 03:04:46.157]  Well, you're going to talk about a lot of it coming up with David Knight, the film.
[03:04:46.157 --> 03:04:47.157]  Folks, get your tickets.
[03:04:47.157 --> 03:04:49.478]  Get down there to Houston, and then soon it'll be a success.
[03:04:49.478 --> 03:04:55.000]  It'll be in Austin, and I'll pop up at one or two of the showings, especially if General Boykin's there or Ron Paul.
[03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:56.621]  RevelationTheMovie.info.
[03:04:56.621 --> 03:04:57.181]  Get your tickets now.
[03:04:58.618 --> 03:05:00.641]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[03:05:00.641 --> 03:05:04.065]  Textilizer wants to be a breathalyzer for your cell phone.
[03:05:04.065 --> 03:05:05.908]  Article up by Gizmodo.
[03:05:05.908 --> 03:05:09.372]  Distracted driving is a hazard up there with drinking and driving.
[03:05:09.372 --> 03:05:15.460]  A solution proposed in a draft New York legislation would solve that using a roadside phone analyzer.
[03:05:15.600 --> 03:05:15.840]  I think?
[03:05:37.850 --> 03:05:38.491]  Sure, buddy.
[03:05:38.491 --> 03:05:41.874]  The actual content of a message, picture, or game would not be revealed.
[03:05:41.874 --> 03:05:43.395]  Yeah, I don't believe that one.
[03:05:43.395 --> 03:05:46.719]  Seeing as how the NSA and others are putting their fingers at everything.
[03:05:46.719 --> 03:05:55.948]  A driver under suspicion of distracted driving will be under extreme pressure to unlock their phone to prove their innocence, giving officers full access to everything on a handset.
[03:05:55.948 --> 03:05:58.190]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.

[03:06:06.873 --> 03:06:08.113]  A 360 win.

[03:06:58.586 --> 03:07:02.549]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[03:07:02.549 --> 03:07:08.855]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[03:07:08.855 --> 03:07:15.821]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[03:07:16.121 --> 03:07:25.251]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[03:07:25.251 --> 03:07:31.418]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[03:07:31.418 --> 03:07:34.562]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and
[03:07:34.882 --> 03:07:35.402]  I don't know.
[03:08:02.572 --> 03:08:05.155]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:09.005 --> 03:08:11.326]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:11.326 --> 03:08:18.749]  I'm David Knight, your host, and I'm going to do the next 20 minutes, and then we're going to have Chuck Untersee and his wife Anita come back in and tell us about Revelation the movie.
[03:08:18.749 --> 03:08:20.530]  They were just talking to Alex Jones.
[03:08:20.530 --> 03:08:22.691]  I want to give you some information, too.
[03:08:22.691 --> 03:08:32.956]  Talking about films, talking about film festivals, of course, Robert De Niro came out and discussed at length why Vaxxed was taken out of the Tribeca Film Festival.
[03:08:32.956 --> 03:08:34.776]  We're going to give you some of his comments.
[03:08:34.776 --> 03:08:35.397]  Before we do,
[03:08:36.357 --> 03:08:39.020]  I want to share this with you.
[03:08:39.020 --> 03:08:51.212]  We've now got CNN and the Wall Street Journal and many other mainstream media outlets talking about how a new task force believes that all teens should be screened for depression.
[03:08:51.212 --> 03:08:52.573]  And guess what they recommend?
[03:08:52.573 --> 03:08:54.395]  You'd never guess.
[03:08:54.395 --> 03:08:55.135]  They want
[03:08:56.181 --> 03:09:03.184]  The SSRIs antidepressants that big pharmaceuticals sell, they want that given to the kids as an anecdote.
[03:09:03.184 --> 03:09:03.964]  Let me read this to you.
[03:09:03.964 --> 03:09:13.028]  All primary care doctors, this is CNN, including pediatricians and family physicians should screen adolescents routinely for depression, they say.
[03:09:13.028 --> 03:09:15.109]  This is new recommendations from the U.S.
[03:09:15.109 --> 03:09:17.930]  Preventative Services Task Force.
[03:09:18.976 --> 03:09:24.240]  And what they're saying is they want to screen all young people between the ages of 12 and 18.
[03:09:24.240 --> 03:09:27.763]  If you're younger than 12, there's not enough evidence yet.
[03:09:27.763 --> 03:09:29.144]  See, they did this first to adults.
[03:09:29.144 --> 03:09:31.005]  They're saying, yeah, we need to start doing it.
[03:09:31.005 --> 03:09:35.488]  But really, this is where they can make it happen, because they can do this in the schools.
[03:09:36.269 --> 03:09:42.454]  And of course, it can also be a precondition for you getting health care treatment as the government takes over health care.
[03:09:42.454 --> 03:09:43.154]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:09:43.154 --> 03:09:45.116]  We have to screen you.
[03:09:45.116 --> 03:09:50.900]  And if we think that you are at risk for depression, we'll give you some suicide pills.
[03:09:50.900 --> 03:09:52.401]  How's that?
[03:09:52.401 --> 03:09:53.202]  The SSRIs.
[03:09:53.202 --> 03:10:02.709]  They say for children younger than 12, there's not enough evidence around which tests work and which treatments are effective to recommend that doctors screen all individuals in this age group.
[03:10:02.709 --> 03:10:03.350]  Yeah, not yet.
[03:10:03.863 --> 03:10:15.993]  They said the last iteration of the recommendations for both adolescents and adults in 2009 stated that doctors should only screen for depression if systems were in place to help at-risk individuals get appropriate treatment and follow-up care.
[03:10:15.993 --> 03:10:18.635]  But this is no longer enough, they say.
[03:10:18.635 --> 03:10:24.840]  Doctors should put those systems in place and screen everyone.
[03:10:24.840 --> 03:10:25.821]  Soviet style.
[03:10:25.821 --> 03:10:26.782]  Okay?
[03:10:27.645 --> 03:10:28.767]  That's what the Soviets did.
[03:10:28.767 --> 03:10:29.928]  You oppose the government?
[03:10:29.928 --> 03:10:32.712]  It must be because you're insane.
[03:10:32.712 --> 03:10:34.334]  We'll put you in an institution.
[03:10:34.334 --> 03:10:37.058]  And we don't need to give you due process to do that.
[03:10:37.058 --> 03:10:41.164]  We just need to have a doctor examine you and sign off on that.
[03:10:41.164 --> 03:10:41.504]  Okay?
[03:10:41.504 --> 03:10:44.809]  Get rid of all those messy legal issues about imprisoning people.
[03:10:45.714 --> 03:10:48.755]  And then a big, big subtitle headline here.
[03:10:48.755 --> 03:10:52.577]  It says, Antidepressants are OK for Adolescents.
[03:10:52.577 --> 03:10:53.477]  That's what they're telling you.
[03:10:53.477 --> 03:10:54.678]  That's the bottom line, folks.
[03:10:54.678 --> 03:10:56.159]  That's how the article ends.
[03:10:56.159 --> 03:10:59.060]  The bottom line is the bottom line.
[03:10:59.060 --> 03:11:01.541]  Big bucks for Big Pharma.
[03:11:01.541 --> 03:11:07.504]  They say, another change in the current recommendation is to support the use of antidepressant medication for treating adolescents who have depression.
[03:11:07.504 --> 03:11:14.127]  So, first they'll tell you you have depression, and then they will sell you their solution, their SSRI suicide pills.
[03:11:15.049 --> 03:11:20.251]  Known as things like Prozac, Lexapro, things that are fluorexetine, okay?
[03:11:20.251 --> 03:11:23.872]  Individuals starting at the age of 8 and 12, respectively.
[03:11:23.872 --> 03:11:29.535]  They have approved those for use starting at 8 years old.
[03:11:29.535 --> 03:11:35.857]  These things have serious consequences for people, just from a physiological standpoint.
[03:11:35.857 --> 03:11:40.619]  But they wreak havoc on these children, especially when they take them off.
[03:11:40.619 --> 03:11:42.880]  So you want to start having physiological
[03:11:46.417 --> 03:11:51.718]  Well, you know, that's when everything really hits the fan.
[03:11:51.718 --> 03:12:01.180]  That's when the kids go out and they kill themselves, sometimes kill other people, sometimes they use guns, sometimes they use knives, but they go crazy.
[03:12:01.180 --> 03:12:02.821]  And we've seen this over and over again.
[03:12:02.821 --> 03:12:07.962]  We have done many, many stories connecting the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[03:12:09.009 --> 03:12:13.332]  And selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs.
[03:12:13.332 --> 03:12:15.533]  We've done that over and over again.
[03:12:15.533 --> 03:12:18.795]  But now they're going to try to extend this all the way down to eight years old.
[03:12:18.795 --> 03:12:20.376]  And they're going to start screening everybody.
[03:12:20.376 --> 03:12:25.899]  And we've got mainstream media all on the same day, rolling it out to prepare you for this.
[03:12:25.899 --> 03:12:34.424]  Now, as Alex Jones has been talking to Chuck Huntersey about Revelation the movie, we see the other way that films try to get
[03:12:35.106 --> 03:12:35.526]  Exposed.
[03:12:35.526 --> 03:12:42.711]  Not in terms of doing a gradual rollout as they're trying to bring that movie out, but you know, you go to a film festival, you try to roll it out that way.
[03:12:42.711 --> 03:12:53.777]  And the people who were behind Vaxxed, subtitled From Cover-Up to Catastrophe, and of course, Dr. Wakefield, who we've had on multiple times, he was the one who made that movie.
[03:12:53.777 --> 03:13:04.184]  That was going to be at Tribeca, and once he started getting some pushback from the mainstream media on that, Robert De Niro came out and said for the first time that he had a son.
[03:13:05.037 --> 03:13:05.517]  That's right.
[03:13:24.440 --> 03:13:27.562]  And I think one of the most interesting revelations there, and he talks at length about it.
[03:13:27.562 --> 03:13:28.782]  He got very passionate about it.
[03:13:28.782 --> 03:13:32.744]  They just kind of mentioned it, and then it took over the interview.
[03:13:32.744 --> 03:13:37.807]  And the lady who was with him, who's basically kind of running the film festival, you could tell she really didn't want the film.
[03:13:37.807 --> 03:13:39.428]  She really didn't want to talk about this shit.
[03:13:39.428 --> 03:13:41.068]  Well, you know, we have other films.
[03:13:41.068 --> 03:13:42.749]  We should talk about those other films.
[03:13:42.749 --> 03:13:43.930]  Kind of shut it down.
[03:13:43.930 --> 03:13:53.575]  And the two anchors were there pushing all the talking points of the big pharmaceutical companies, just as everybody's pushing the talking points of the big pharmaceutical companies with these
[03:13:54.255 --> 03:13:58.058]  Mandatory screenings for teens.
[03:13:58.058 --> 03:14:09.508]  But one of the things I thought was most interesting that came out of this was Robert De Niro, and she, said that it was the filmmakers who are really putting the pressure to shut this down, to censor it.
[03:14:09.508 --> 03:14:10.970]  Don't let people hear that.
[03:14:10.970 --> 03:14:18.416]  You know, Robert De Niro was saying, hey, all I wanted is for the movie to be seen and people can make up their own judgment, but you must see it, he said.
[03:14:18.416 --> 03:14:20.078]  Let's find out the truth.
[03:14:21.021 --> 03:14:24.202]  Well, they said filmmakers are pressuring them to not do that.
[03:14:24.202 --> 03:14:26.383]  And I have to say, isn't that amazing?
[03:14:26.383 --> 03:14:28.964]  When we see filmmakers calling for censorship.
[03:14:28.964 --> 03:14:34.266]  It's kind of like when Megyn Kelly called for Donald Trump to be banned in the name of the First Amendment.
[03:14:34.266 --> 03:14:39.668]  She wanted CNN and Bill O'Reilly to join her in banning Donald Trump from the airwaves.
[03:14:39.668 --> 03:14:41.268]  She said, you know, we have to hang together.
[03:14:41.268 --> 03:14:42.669]  This is for the First Amendment.
[03:14:42.669 --> 03:14:45.310]  Censorship in the name of the First Amendment.
[03:14:45.310 --> 03:14:48.631]  And here you got filmmakers doing censorship in the name of a film festival.
[03:14:49.554 --> 03:15:00.339]  And I would remind them that one of the first uses of the Espionage Act, and of course that was something that has been a hallmark of the Obama administration, the misuse of the Espionage Act.
[03:15:00.339 --> 03:15:11.483]  It was set up for people who were actual spies, but of course Obama has used it more than anybody else, more than all the other presidents combined, to come after journalists and whistleblowers who are not spies.
[03:15:11.483 --> 03:15:14.545]  Labeling them as spies, misusing this
[03:15:15.418 --> 03:15:16.078]  We're good to go.
[03:15:31.696 --> 03:15:41.139]  Learned the bitter lessons of World War I when they were tricked into fighting into that war by Woodrow Wilson back to lecture us about why we need to put America first.
[03:15:41.139 --> 03:15:50.322]  The only person talking about that now is Donald Trump and of course everybody and both Republicans and Democrats and the media establishment, they're all looking at him saying, is this guy crazy?
[03:15:50.322 --> 03:15:52.642]  We have to have a world empire.
[03:15:52.642 --> 03:15:54.183]  We can't put America first.
[03:15:54.183 --> 03:15:59.304]  We need to go over there and be the world's policemen, unpaid policemen, the unpaid mercenaries of the world.
[03:15:59.304 --> 03:15:59.885]  But back in 1917,
[03:16:01.661 --> 03:16:04.863]  A guy who had done the costuming for Birth of a Nation.
[03:16:04.863 --> 03:16:05.904]  That was the D.W.
[03:16:05.904 --> 03:16:09.607]  Griffith movie about the Civil War and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan through Reconstruction.
[03:16:09.607 --> 03:16:10.767]  He had done the costumes for that.
[03:16:10.767 --> 03:16:12.649]  Of course, that is a landmark film.
[03:16:12.649 --> 03:16:18.613]  It's the first time they did a long-form movie like we see today.
[03:16:19.133 --> 03:16:21.235]  Prior to that, there were very short, silent films.
[03:16:21.235 --> 03:16:23.918]  Well, he wanted to do a film about the American Revolution.
[03:16:23.918 --> 03:16:25.159]  He called it Spirit of 1776.
[03:16:25.159 --> 03:16:26.801]  Well, the bad guys were, guess what?
[03:16:26.801 --> 03:16:27.582]  The British.
[03:16:27.582 --> 03:16:31.366]  The people that Woodrow Wilson wanted us to go to war on their side.
[03:16:32.577 --> 03:16:39.119]  And so, Woodrow Wilson had him brought up on charges of aiding and abetting the enemy.
[03:16:39.119 --> 03:16:42.680]  Because, you know, if you're against the British, you're for the Germans.
[03:16:42.680 --> 03:16:46.441]  And so, therefore, he needs to be brought up on charges for the Espionage Act.
[03:16:46.441 --> 03:16:47.341]  He was sentenced.
[03:16:47.341 --> 03:16:50.662]  This film producer, we're talking about coming after film producers again.
[03:16:50.662 --> 03:16:52.323]  Things are coming full circle, aren't they?
[03:16:52.323 --> 03:16:53.243]  We're embracing
[03:16:53.803 --> 03:17:01.015]  That censorship, as we come against film producers, they come against the FCC, the Federal Elections Commission.
[03:17:01.015 --> 03:17:05.363]  Three of the Democrats all wanted to come after Joel Gilbert, the film producer.
[03:17:06.817 --> 03:17:13.764]  Well they sentenced this guy to 10 years in jail and a $5,000 fine back in 1917.
[03:17:13.764 --> 03:17:29.358]  That would be about $500,000 today because remember the Federal Reserve that Woodrow Wilson also helped to create has taken away 99% of our purchasing power so that $5,000 fine that they gave him then would be a half million dollar fine today and a 10 year
[03:17:30.239 --> 03:17:30.839]  Jail sentence.
[03:17:30.839 --> 03:17:32.900]  And you say, well, how could they do that?
[03:17:32.900 --> 03:17:39.702]  How could they send somebody to jail for doing a movie about the American Revolution?
[03:17:39.702 --> 03:17:42.863]  Being too anti-British.
[03:17:42.863 --> 03:17:45.884]  Well, you know, that's essentially where we wind up, folks.
[03:17:45.884 --> 03:17:48.744]  And the Supreme Court was fine with that.
[03:17:48.744 --> 03:17:51.605]  The Supreme Court allowed that to happen.
[03:17:51.605 --> 03:17:53.986]  They said there is no First Amendment for movies.
[03:17:54.486 --> 03:17:56.788]  And they allowed that to stand until 1952.
[03:17:56.788 --> 03:18:06.655]  Now we have filmmakers, lefty filmmakers, at the Tribeca Film Festival saying there should be no First Amendment for filmmakers.
[03:18:06.655 --> 03:18:08.456]  We should censor their speech.
[03:18:08.456 --> 03:18:11.318]  We're seeing this over and over and over again.
[03:18:11.778 --> 03:18:18.804]  Some of the stuff that Robert De Niro said, he said, there's a lot of information about things that are happening with the CDC, with the pharmaceutical companies.
[03:18:18.804 --> 03:18:23.128]  There's a lot of things that are not said, he said, said De Niro.
[03:18:23.128 --> 03:18:26.711]  He said he felt people were trying to shut down discussion around vaccines and autism.
[03:18:26.711 --> 03:18:28.452]  Yeah, precisely, precisely.
[03:18:28.452 --> 03:18:31.455]  And they were able to do it in his film festival as well.
[03:18:31.455 --> 03:18:34.057]  He says there's more to this than meets the eye, believe me, he warned.
[03:18:34.057 --> 03:18:35.899]  There's something that people aren't addressing.
[03:18:35.899 --> 03:18:38.161]  And for me to get so upset here, on the Today Show,
[03:18:38.681 --> 03:18:41.062]  With you guys means there's something there.
[03:18:41.062 --> 03:18:43.202]  Part of me does regret pulling it.
[03:18:43.202 --> 03:18:51.204]  And part of me says, let it go for now and I'll deal with it later in another way because I didn't want the festival to be affected.
[03:18:51.204 --> 03:18:52.945]  We have to get over the idea.
[03:18:52.945 --> 03:18:54.565]  I understand it's a difficult thing.
[03:18:54.565 --> 03:18:56.305]  You've got a lot invested in your life.
[03:18:56.305 --> 03:18:58.486]  You've got a lot invested in your business.
[03:18:58.486 --> 03:19:01.447]  We all have to make those decisions at one point or the other.
[03:19:01.447 --> 03:19:05.128]  And it's a tough decision and I'm not questioning his decision.
[03:19:05.128 --> 03:19:06.668]  But when we get to the point
[03:19:07.904 --> 03:19:14.147]  Where freedom and liberty mean more to us than security and safety, then we'll have a country again.
[03:19:14.147 --> 03:19:16.648]  He says there's a kind of hysteria, a knee-jerk reaction.
[03:19:16.648 --> 03:19:20.711]  Everybody should have a choice whether or not to take vaccines or not.
[03:19:20.711 --> 03:19:24.152]  But it does benefit big drug companies, he said.
[03:19:24.152 --> 03:19:26.854]  So he was upfront and honest about that.
[03:19:26.854 --> 03:19:31.256]  Now when we look at what's happening with us, and we're going to be back in just a moment,
[03:19:32.409 --> 03:19:35.911]  I want to tell you what Harry Reid is doing out in Nevada.
[03:19:35.911 --> 03:19:39.613]  Remember, they tried to take the land once.
[03:19:39.613 --> 03:19:40.773]  Now they've got a new scheme.
[03:19:40.773 --> 03:19:45.336]  They're going to go back to another ancient law from a hundred years ago, the Antiquities Act.
[03:19:45.336 --> 03:19:52.920]  Obama has been taking millions of acres with a stroke of pen, and now that the Bundys are locked up in jail, Harry Reid is back, sniffing around to take their land.
[03:19:52.920 --> 03:19:53.520]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:02.202 --> 03:20:09.627]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a SelectQuote agent with a true story of how SelectQuote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[03:20:09.627 --> 03:20:13.229]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:20:13.229 --> 03:20:16.932]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:20:17.592 --> 03:20:19.413]  I said, let me see.
[03:20:19.413 --> 03:20:30.477]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:20:30.477 --> 03:20:41.602]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[03:20:42.560 --> 03:20:43.561]  How about you?

[03:22:07.401 --> 03:22:09.742]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?
[03:22:09.742 --> 03:22:13.524]  Are you willing to gamble your family's safety that it'll never happen to you?

[03:22:58.689 --> 03:23:05.892]  When Dr. Lane Sebring appeared on Fox News and claimed that he could give seniors a second shot at youth, viewers were highly skeptical.
[03:23:05.892 --> 03:23:07.713]  But then they saw the proof.
[03:23:07.713 --> 03:23:14.716]  Despite being 61 years old, Dr. Sebring is still competing in martial arts competitions against guys half his age and winning.
[03:23:14.716 --> 03:23:18.298]  But what's even more remarkable are his lab tests that back it all up.
[03:23:18.298 --> 03:23:23.480]  His blood pressure checks in at a healthy 110 over 78 and his blood sugar never jumps above 70.
[03:23:24.200 --> 03:23:25.401]  So what's his secret?
[03:23:25.401 --> 03:23:30.666]  Sebring has been using a powerful green drink that he personally formulated called Patriot Power Greens.
[03:23:30.666 --> 03:23:36.891]  Patriot Power Greens was originally created to help older guys in the military who are dealing with achy joints and stiff muscles.
[03:23:36.891 --> 03:23:41.715]  And for a limited time, Dr. Sebring is letting you try the drink absolutely free.
[03:23:41.715 --> 03:23:44.538]  All he asks is that you chip in a few bucks to help cover shipping.
[03:23:44.798 --> 03:23:48.940]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.

[03:24:09.369 --> 03:24:10.709]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:10.709 --> 03:24:15.291]  I'm David Knight, and we're going to be talking to Chuck and Anita Undersea.
[03:24:15.291 --> 03:24:18.892]  They are the producers of Revelation, the movie.
[03:24:18.892 --> 03:24:20.092]  We'll be talking to them about that.
[03:24:20.092 --> 03:24:33.695]  We were just talking about the film festival, the Tribeca Film Festival, where the movie by Dr. Wakefield about vaccines and an autism connection that he believes he discovered, that was censored by the filmmakers, we were told.
[03:24:33.695 --> 03:24:35.316]  We're going to talk about what's happening
[03:24:36.542 --> 03:24:44.044]  Out West with Harry Reid, with Barack Obama and his pen, taking millions of acres and how they're updating this.
[03:24:44.044 --> 03:24:48.985]  In just a moment, before we do, real quickly, I want to let you know that we have Rainforest now in stock.
[03:24:48.985 --> 03:24:54.806]  And not only is it in stock, but we have a 25% off special at Infowarslife.com.
[03:24:54.806 --> 03:24:58.787]  This is an unprecedented 25% off while supplies last.
[03:24:58.787 --> 03:24:59.827]  I use this all the time.
[03:24:59.827 --> 03:25:03.288]  You know, if I had taken this and they had
[03:25:04.592 --> 03:25:05.834]  Ask me what I would name this.
[03:25:05.834 --> 03:25:10.359]  I would have called it instead of brain force, I would have called it brain focus because that's what it does for me.
[03:25:10.359 --> 03:25:12.681]  It focuses my thoughts.
[03:25:12.681 --> 03:25:15.304]  It gives me the words that I'm struggling to try to remember.
[03:25:15.304 --> 03:25:19.869]  I can't remember somebody's name or a date and it's just there when I'm taking this stuff.
[03:25:19.869 --> 03:25:25.014]  It uses natural brain activation ingredients like yerba mate extract, alpha GPC.
[03:25:25.014 --> 03:25:25.895]  It focuses you.
[03:25:27.874 --> 03:25:35.501]  It brings your concentration and it doesn't do it in a way that makes you, I guess, jittery like you would with coffee, okay?
[03:25:35.501 --> 03:25:37.743]  It doesn't keep you awake at night, that type of thing.
[03:25:37.743 --> 03:25:42.787]  All those things are reasons why it's my favorite supplement that I take here at Infowarslife.com.
[03:25:42.787 --> 03:25:46.671]  Go to Infowarslife.com, take a look at the hundreds of five-star reviews that we have there.
[03:25:47.191 --> 03:25:51.596]  Determine for yourself if this is something that you should get, that you would like to use.
[03:25:51.596 --> 03:25:56.581]  And again, 25% off Brain Force while supplies last.
[03:25:56.581 --> 03:26:00.164]  And as long as this special lasts.
[03:26:00.164 --> 03:26:09.133]  Now as I was talking about with Harry Reid, and of course we had these articles earlier in the day, the headlines, millionaires are fleeing Chicago over fear of civil unrest.
[03:26:09.133 --> 03:26:09.974]  Where do you think they're going?
[03:26:10.615 --> 03:26:11.996]  Are they going to LA?
[03:26:11.996 --> 03:26:13.616]  Think they're going to New York?
[03:26:13.616 --> 03:26:17.238]  No, they're not going to go to another city, just like Chuck Untersee was saying.
[03:26:17.238 --> 03:26:18.478]  He doesn't like being in the city.
[03:26:18.478 --> 03:26:19.559]  I don't like being in the city.
[03:26:19.559 --> 03:26:20.999]  They don't like being in the city.
[03:26:20.999 --> 03:26:22.540]  It's dangerous, okay?
[03:26:22.540 --> 03:26:28.262]  Going all the way back to Thomas Jefferson, he said, cities are a threat to the health, the wealth, and the liberties of man.
[03:26:28.262 --> 03:26:31.324]  Well, it's a lot more dangerous today, especially if we have a societal breakdown.
[03:26:31.324 --> 03:26:33.285]  Where are they going to build their bunkers?
[03:26:33.285 --> 03:26:33.985]  They're going out
[03:26:34.645 --> 03:26:39.728]  Into the areas that the government is now making off-limits to us.
[03:26:39.728 --> 03:26:47.653]  Saying they're doing it to make it into a park, and yet they only release, to make available to the public, only about 1% of these parks.
[03:26:47.653 --> 03:26:50.494]  Really not making it available to people.
[03:26:50.494 --> 03:26:57.578]  We now have Harry Reid, who is trying to take the last rancher in that Nevada area out.
[03:26:57.578 --> 03:27:03.762]  There had been over 50 ranchers in that area, and Clive and Bundy was the last one, and they were making it impossible for them.
[03:27:04.673 --> 03:27:16.104]  They still had their grazing rights, their water rights, but they were basically drawing the lines tighter and tighter around those, saying, well, you can't graze during these times of the years when you had to graze.
[03:27:16.104 --> 03:27:19.127]  That was when they needed to be there in order to make it work.
[03:27:19.127 --> 03:27:21.489]  So restricting them continually.
[03:27:21.489 --> 03:27:23.932]  And so as a protest, he stopped paying his grazing fees.
[03:27:23.932 --> 03:27:25.313]  You know what happened with all that?
[03:27:25.313 --> 03:27:26.915]  We've talked about that many times, but of course,
[03:27:27.884 --> 03:27:29.726]  They backed off now that they're in jail.
[03:27:29.726 --> 03:27:35.692]  Harry Reid says, well, with the Bundys and their pals in jail, now's the right time to reach out to the White House.
[03:27:35.692 --> 03:27:41.518]  The White House can take their pen, use the Antiquities Act, and just say, this is going to be a monument.
[03:27:41.518 --> 03:27:48.705]  See, if they had to make it a park, they'd have to go through all these messy congressional hearings, and they'd have to pass laws with legislators.
[03:27:48.705 --> 03:27:49.766]  No, he can just do it with his pen.
[03:27:50.843 --> 03:27:52.584]  And that's what's really behind all this.
[03:27:52.584 --> 03:27:55.466]  And I have to ask you, you know, where do the presidential candidates stand on this?
[03:27:55.466 --> 03:27:58.668]  Have you heard anybody ask this question to them in the debates?
[03:27:58.668 --> 03:27:59.809]  Absolutely not.
[03:27:59.809 --> 03:28:00.189]  No, no, no.
[03:28:00.189 --> 03:28:01.129]  We're not going to talk about that.
[03:28:01.129 --> 03:28:06.272]  We're going to talk about Megyn Kelly's hurt feelings and other stuff like that, okay, that really matters.
[03:28:06.272 --> 03:28:09.554]  Well, let me tell you what Ted Cruz has said about this.
[03:28:09.554 --> 03:28:10.015]  Ted Cruz.
[03:28:11.141 --> 03:28:16.308]  Introduce Senate Amendment 3456 to the Bipartisan Sportsman Act of 2014.
[03:28:16.308 --> 03:28:21.495]  It would have prohibited the federal government from owning more than 50% of the land in any state.
[03:28:21.495 --> 03:28:22.457]  Well, gee, that's great.
[03:28:22.457 --> 03:28:23.458]  Isn't that magnanimous?
[03:28:23.458 --> 03:28:25.641]  Where does he come up with that figure?
[03:28:25.641 --> 03:28:26.903]  Where's that in the Constitution? 50%?
[03:28:28.629 --> 03:28:32.734]  Where does it say that the federal government can own any land outside of Washington, D.C.?
[03:28:32.734 --> 03:28:33.155]  It doesn't.
[03:28:33.155 --> 03:28:35.158]  It says Washington, D.C.
[03:28:35.158 --> 03:28:37.981]  and the necessary forts and ports and things like that.
[03:28:37.981 --> 03:28:40.204]  Not that they're going to own 80 or 90 percent.
[03:28:40.204 --> 03:28:41.967]  Why would we draw the line at 50 percent?
[03:28:41.967 --> 03:28:45.431]  Well, it's just part of his arbitrary living constitution approach.
[03:28:46.277 --> 03:28:51.864]  Just let's say, you know, I want to make the federal government and the insiders in Washington happy, the Bushies who are supporting me.
[03:28:51.864 --> 03:28:52.925]  Let's just say 50%.
[03:28:52.925 --> 03:28:54.547]  That should make the BLM happy.
[03:28:54.547 --> 03:28:56.549]  That should make the people out West happy.
[03:28:56.549 --> 03:28:57.690]  So he just draws a line there.
[03:28:57.690 --> 03:29:01.695]  Look, the Constitution either says something or it doesn't.
[03:29:01.695 --> 03:29:02.596]  And when you talk about
[03:29:03.459 --> 03:29:14.666]  We're going to change the Constitution because of pressure or because of public opinion, as he did with his stance on marijuana prohibition.
[03:29:14.666 --> 03:29:26.634]  In 2014, Ted Cruz said that it was an abuse of executive power for Barack Obama to say that states who had voted on it in Colorado and Washington and other places, you need to shut them down!
[03:29:26.634 --> 03:29:28.375]  That's an abuse of executive power.
[03:29:28.375 --> 03:29:29.296]  No!
[03:29:29.296 --> 03:29:32.598]  It's a recognition, a rare recognition, of the Tenth Amendment.
[03:29:33.138 --> 03:29:35.500]  But now he says, no, that's okay.
[03:29:35.500 --> 03:29:37.001]  I'm for federalism.
[03:29:37.001 --> 03:29:38.383]  Well, what about cocaine then?
[03:29:38.383 --> 03:29:40.284]  I mean, where does he draw the line?
[03:29:40.284 --> 03:29:42.746]  He's not a constitutional originalist.
[03:29:42.746 --> 03:29:44.688]  He is an opportunist.
[03:29:44.688 --> 03:29:47.070]  He supports a living constitution.
[03:29:47.070 --> 03:29:49.572]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with the producers.
[03:29:49.572 --> 03:29:52.094]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.094 --> 03:29:54.797]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.812 --> 03:30:02.853]  Uber admits it gave data on 12 million users to U.S.
[03:30:02.853 --> 03:30:03.273]  government.
[03:30:03.273 --> 03:30:08.254]  Ridesharing company admits to complying with roughly 85% of requests from law enforcement.
[03:30:08.254 --> 03:30:11.015]  Article up by Mikael Thelen at Infowars.com.
[03:30:11.015 --> 03:30:14.276]  Now according to the company's first ever transparency report, both U.S.
[03:30:14.276 --> 03:30:20.577]  law enforcement and regulators were provided with information on millions of users between July and December of 2015.
[03:30:20.577 --> 03:30:24.738]  We received requests from law enforcement agencies for information about our riders.
[03:30:24.918 --> 03:30:35.488]  Requests from law enforcement agencies at both the state and federal level included information on everything from pickup and drop-off locations to the identity of specific drivers and passengers.
[03:30:35.488 --> 03:30:43.376]  None of the inquiries are believed to be related to national security since Uber did not receive any requests issued under the provisions of national security statutes.
[03:30:43.496 --> 03:30:49.923]  But in many cases, they send blanket requests explaining why the information is needed or how it will be used, Uber wrote.
[03:30:49.923 --> 03:30:55.168]  And while this kind of trip data doesn't include personal information, it can reveal patterns or behavior.

[03:31:58.513 --> 03:31:59.474]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[03:31:59.474 --> 03:32:00.034]  Good, brother.
[03:32:00.034 --> 03:32:01.996]  Just recently started using your products.
[03:32:01.996 --> 03:32:03.718]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:32:03.718 --> 03:32:07.742]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:32:07.742 --> 03:32:10.364]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[03:32:10.364 --> 03:32:12.786]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[03:32:12.786 --> 03:32:20.754]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[03:32:20.954 --> 03:32:24.078]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[03:32:24.078 --> 03:32:25.720]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[03:32:25.720 --> 03:32:30.425]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[03:32:30.425 --> 03:32:35.791]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[03:32:35.891 --> 03:32:36.812]  We're good to go.
[03:33:12.674 --> 03:33:18.991]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:30.529 --> 03:33:31.810]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:31.810 --> 03:33:37.996]  I'm David Knight, and I'm joined with Chuck Huntersey and his wife, Anita, and we're going to talk about Revelation the Movie.
[03:33:37.996 --> 03:33:40.418]  You can find that at revelationthemovie.info.
[03:33:40.418 --> 03:33:42.900]  You can also get tickets there as well, right?
[03:33:42.900 --> 03:33:51.928]  Yeah, revelationthemovie.info, and then one of the icons at the bottom of our homepage has a tickets option, and it goes straight to Fandango and Santico Theatres directly.
[03:33:52.208 --> 03:34:00.676]  And that's very important, because what I started talking about at the beginning of the hour was how Robert De Niro and the Tribeca Film Festival had shut down Vaxxed.
[03:34:00.676 --> 03:34:07.162]  Robert De Niro personally wanted it, but the lady who was managing it, other filmmakers, wanted to censor that point of view.
[03:34:07.782 --> 03:34:17.064]  Talk to us about why you're going straight to this kind of release, a limited release, to try to show interest in that, and that's what people need to understand.
[03:34:17.064 --> 03:34:23.045]  This is where you can make your voice heard by supporting films like this, like this film.
[03:34:23.045 --> 03:34:26.606]  If it has a high per screen average, then you can begin to get this in more and more screens.
[03:34:26.606 --> 03:34:28.486]  You can get it picked up across the nation.
[03:34:28.486 --> 03:34:33.987]  That's how you get past the gatekeepers at the film festivals and that sort of thing.
[03:34:34.247 --> 03:34:42.636]  Right, we never really even tried film festivals because, well actually we did try a couple of festivals, no names to be mentioned, but we were turned down because of the content.
[03:34:42.636 --> 03:34:44.397]  They were fully liberal.
[03:34:44.397 --> 03:34:45.759]  Most film festivals are.
[03:34:45.759 --> 03:34:49.863]  You wouldn't even have a chance at Southwest here in Austin.
[03:34:49.863 --> 03:34:50.524]  So the point is,
[03:34:52.016 --> 03:34:53.597]  We are more than the vaccine thing.
[03:34:53.597 --> 03:34:55.037]  I mean you're not gonna find anybody there.
[03:34:55.037 --> 03:35:15.505]  I mean he got some Sympathy there because Robert Nunez had a personal Experience with his son who believed had autism because of vaccine connection, but you're not gonna find anybody that wants to run a conservative Libertarian Christian Christian worldview of the New World Order and the coming world government you're gonna find that at any of these film festivals
[03:35:16.045 --> 03:35:29.388]  I know, and it was the same with people to be in it, but like when we got Charlie, we looked and looked for it, because we did commercials, national commercials for years in L.A., and I know that to market commercials, obviously all corporations find their celebrity spokesman.
[03:35:29.388 --> 03:35:30.488]  Well, you can't find one.
[03:35:30.488 --> 03:35:31.728]  Nobody will stand up.
[03:35:31.728 --> 03:35:42.310]  But in the case of this film, we went, we initially released a version early on called Behold the Pale Horse on DVD, and we thought, well, that's it.
[03:35:42.310 --> 03:35:44.211]  We'll do like everybody else, we'll sell the DVDs.
[03:35:45.031 --> 03:35:46.072]  That'll be that.
[03:35:46.072 --> 03:35:57.523]  And then that was simultaneous when we did that to 2016 coming out being successful and the distributor contacted us and said, hey, this could be the next 2016 theatrically.
[03:35:57.523 --> 03:36:06.871]  Well, what people don't realize is the 2016 was the only conservative documentary ever in theaters.
[03:36:07.572 --> 03:36:11.433]  And it was super successful because the timing... That's Dinesh D'Souza's.
[03:36:11.433 --> 03:36:12.774]  Dinesh D'Souza, yeah.
[03:36:12.774 --> 03:36:23.758]  And so the timing was perfect for them, but it's more perfect for us today with this crescendo of political furor going on with the election.
[03:36:23.758 --> 03:36:26.819]  To release it is a perfect storm to get this message out.
[03:36:26.819 --> 03:36:29.960]  And so the other issue that is so critical
[03:36:30.840 --> 03:36:40.125]  Is that the American people, or the average Joe, is trained like Pavlov's dogs to get all their information from the news, from television, and regular radio.
[03:36:40.125 --> 03:36:47.709]  And so when they hear a celebrity is involved in something, they see it on TV, they see it in a movie, they think, this is a big deal, we need to pay attention.
[03:36:47.709 --> 03:36:52.051]  So that is the ruse which will make this get our message out.
[03:36:52.051 --> 03:36:56.974]  Because if the Patriot community will act as Paul Revere's
[03:36:57.614 --> 03:37:06.520]  To go out to those gray people out there who have a heart for America and know something's wrong but couldn't put their finger on it, then it could really explode.
[03:37:06.520 --> 03:37:16.627]  And I liked your movie much better than Dinesh D'Souza's movie because I thought his movie started laying out the case against his thesis for a very, very long time before it ever had any rebuttal.
[03:37:17.407 --> 03:37:20.410]  But, and I thought it kind of drugged as a documentary.
[03:37:20.410 --> 03:37:21.851]  Yours is very fast-paced.
[03:37:21.851 --> 03:37:28.698]  I've seen the whole documentary and it is very, very fast-paced because you continually mix it up with quotes from different people.
[03:37:28.698 --> 03:37:36.286]  You've got the central narrative that's going there through with Charlie Daniels and General Boykin and Alex Jones.
[03:37:36.946 --> 03:37:43.811]  They kind of provide a continuity there, but then you're pulling in people with all these different perspectives on different sub-issues there.
[03:37:43.811 --> 03:37:45.432]  I want to give out the phone number real quickly.
[03:37:45.432 --> 03:37:45.853]  The number is 800-259-9231.
[03:37:45.853 --> 03:37:48.915]  That's 800-259-9231 if you'd like to talk to Chuck Untersee or Anita about this movie that's coming out.
[03:37:56.707 --> 03:37:58.028]  Revelation the Movie.
[03:37:58.028 --> 03:38:00.230]  You can find it at revelationthemovie.info.
[03:38:00.230 --> 03:38:05.154]  It's got an opening this Friday, and is it also Saturday in Houston?
[03:38:05.154 --> 03:38:16.844]  It'll be open to the public Friday in Santico Theatres, which is the Texas chain, in Richmond and Tombaugh, which is the western side of Houston, and then subject to, well, it's all on demand.
[03:38:16.844 --> 03:38:20.067]  Any film stays in theaters as long as there's demand.
[03:38:20.067 --> 03:38:23.090]  And so, but the opening weekend is critical because
[03:38:23.530 --> 03:38:29.274]  We have now put in place the deal to release it nationally, which would be 2,000 to 3,000 theaters.
[03:38:29.274 --> 03:38:29.614]  Wow.
[03:38:29.614 --> 03:38:36.379]  And so, but still, it has to have a smashing opening weekend to keep those people on the page.
[03:38:36.379 --> 03:38:37.860]  So this is what you can do.
[03:38:37.860 --> 03:38:41.722]  You know, we have filmmakers who want to actually censor information.
[03:38:41.722 --> 03:38:45.165]  They don't want to see at these film festivals like we're talking about with Vax.
[03:38:45.165 --> 03:38:46.486]  They don't want that information out there.
[03:38:46.986 --> 03:38:59.559]  Of course, film festivals don't want a movie like this out there, but if you want this information to get out, it's basically what you hear here on the Alex Jones Show, but with a documentary film, you get a context to it that you can't do in the news.
[03:38:59.559 --> 03:39:09.690]  We can't go back and cover how we got here in such detail as you guys can, bring in all these different voices, do it so quickly, cut it tightly, you just can't do that on a news broadcast.
[03:39:09.810 --> 03:39:18.359]  What we're doing is giving people, okay, here's where we are right now, give them a quick snapshot of it, but you're giving them the whole context, putting it in a historical, political context.
[03:39:18.359 --> 03:39:20.321]  That's what's so valuable about a documentary.
[03:39:20.321 --> 03:39:25.106]  You mentioned a minute ago about how it's cut, and my background was national commercials.
[03:39:25.106 --> 03:39:25.867]  We worked in L.A.
[03:39:25.867 --> 03:39:26.587]  for over 20 years.
[03:39:27.168 --> 03:39:28.470]  And I was a director cameraman.
[03:39:28.470 --> 03:39:30.032]  We had our own company.
[03:39:30.032 --> 03:39:37.781]  But like commercials are cut because people's attention span today is very short, you can cut things very quickly.
[03:39:37.781 --> 03:39:41.846]  I mean, you'd be shocked how much you can get in a 30-second commercial in terms of an edit.
[03:39:41.846 --> 03:39:45.291]  So we had so much information to relay.
[03:39:45.831 --> 03:39:53.234]  That we had, like I told Alex earlier, we had 42 hours of footage and 38 rock stars of the Patriot community.
[03:39:53.234 --> 03:40:09.900]  So the point was to get all of this information out as quickly as possible but in a comprehensive way so that anyone that watches it, very few people would not grasp something that they're interested in and the challenge we have to the people that see it that don't understand what's going on
[03:40:10.400 --> 03:40:16.644]  It's to get on the internet, and every keyword they put in is there, when they probably had no idea about any of these issues.
[03:40:16.644 --> 03:40:18.285]  Agenda 21, for instance.
[03:40:18.285 --> 03:40:19.285]  It's all there.
[03:40:19.285 --> 03:40:26.649]  There's nothing new about what we have in the film to the Patriot community, but we want the Patriot community to get it out to those gray people who don't know.
[03:40:26.649 --> 03:40:31.732]  The first time I met Alex, I said, I thought I'm coming to Valhalla, and I'm going to get the answer.
[03:40:31.732 --> 03:40:33.293]  I know how we solve all this.
[03:40:33.293 --> 03:40:34.174]  And basically, he said,
[03:40:35.114 --> 03:40:39.998]  Yeah, he kicked back in his chair and he said, there's two issues, how we're going to fix this.
[03:40:39.998 --> 03:40:44.141]  Wear out your knees praying and education.
[03:40:44.141 --> 03:40:44.501]  Yeah.
[03:40:44.501 --> 03:40:46.143]  And so that's the point of this film.
[03:40:46.143 --> 03:40:53.569]  This film is a tool for patriots to get out to everybody else who everybody's got friends and family who don't get it.
[03:40:53.569 --> 03:40:55.030]  And if they did get it,
[03:40:56.837 --> 03:41:10.527]  You know, a general boy can tell me, I'm a retired Army officer, a general boy can tell me one time, if I tell you to take that hill as an example of what's going on, and you struggle all the way to the top, half the men are dead, and you turn around and look behind you and nobody there, what's the point?
[03:41:10.527 --> 03:41:11.688]  And that's the point.
[03:41:11.688 --> 03:41:13.470]  We have to get Americans
[03:41:14.674 --> 03:41:20.257]  Regular Americans to, you know, look over their shoulder and have a lot of people behind them.
[03:41:20.257 --> 03:41:21.317]  And that's very key.
[03:41:21.317 --> 03:41:25.259]  Just as we're looking at today, the elite are buying bomb-proof luxury survival bunkers.
[03:41:25.259 --> 03:41:26.459]  They're getting out of the cities.
[03:41:26.459 --> 03:41:27.680]  They understand what's going on.
[03:41:27.680 --> 03:41:28.100]  I am too.
[03:41:28.100 --> 03:41:29.701]  At the same time, you are too.
[03:41:29.701 --> 03:41:31.301]  I want to talk to you about that too.
[03:41:31.301 --> 03:41:32.122]  At the same time...
[03:41:32.802 --> 03:41:34.623]  They're concentrating us into the cities.
[03:41:34.623 --> 03:41:42.645]  They're putting technologies in place with the self-driving cars, with the boxes that they're going to put in, that are going to be speaking to the infrastructure.
[03:41:42.645 --> 03:41:46.006]  They talk about it as a vehicle to infrastructure communication.
[03:41:46.006 --> 03:41:47.406]  They're going to mandate those boxes.
[03:41:47.406 --> 03:41:54.729]  They're going to be tracking, taxing, and controlling our movements, confining us into the cities, concentrating us into the cities.
[03:41:57.256 --> 03:41:58.658]  We need to get people to wake up.
[03:41:58.658 --> 03:42:01.622]  We called Agenda 21 and people's eyes just glossed over.
[03:42:01.622 --> 03:42:14.880]  But one of the ways that you do this is, tell us a little bit about your lifestyle and what you do to decompress after going through these 40 plus hours of... Well you won't see it, but Anita will probably reach over and pinch me because she always tells me, don't tell people.
[03:42:15.280 --> 03:42:16.721]  But we lived in L.A.
[03:42:16.721 --> 03:42:17.541]  for 23 years.
[03:42:17.541 --> 03:42:31.628]  I'm from East Texas, grew up in a rural environment, and when we moved back here, well, we moved back here because our house burned, and it was, everybody was wringing their hands, and I'm so sorry, and, you know, patting us on the head, and it was the happiest day of my life because...
[03:42:32.108 --> 03:42:33.650]  I was able to see the L.A.
[03:42:33.650 --> 03:42:37.314]  skyline in the rearview mirror of my truck pulling horses back to Texas.
[03:42:37.314 --> 03:42:48.888]  So the point is, I had at that time written a war of cessation, Civil War movie script called Rebel Private about Texas during the Civil War and basically had it funded.
[03:42:48.888 --> 03:42:52.152]  And when Obama got in in 08, the people behind it were
[03:42:53.892 --> 03:43:09.199]  Nervous and they said we're gonna put this on hold and that's when we we turned to this and it was a matter of providence was no whole story but the point is we moved back here because of having written that script about Civil War and very into history and my great-great-grandfather in 1860 with the Texas Ranger and
[03:43:10.840 --> 03:43:15.465]  And, you know, it's long history in Texas since the Texas Revolution.
[03:43:15.465 --> 03:43:17.167]  Point is, I was always interested in history.
[03:43:17.167 --> 03:43:22.392]  So, when we moved back here, and after living in Malibu, which is not that crowded, but L.A.
[03:43:22.392 --> 03:43:26.776]  generally is horrendous, we wanted to get in a really remote environment.
[03:43:26.776 --> 03:43:31.902]  I would like to have moved in the middle of Big Bend, but Anita wouldn't deal with it.
[03:43:31.902 --> 03:43:32.843]  So, we found a place.
[03:43:34.344 --> 03:43:39.006]  Not that big, 60 acres, but it's surrounded by thousands of acres where nobody lives, really.
[03:43:39.006 --> 03:43:41.826]  And no wires, no neighbors, no lights.
[03:43:41.826 --> 03:43:46.368]  And I knew about the whole smart meter thing, and I wanted to be off the grid.
[03:43:46.368 --> 03:43:48.889]  In fact, we had been off the grid in Malibu.
[03:43:48.889 --> 03:43:55.891]  So we, for the first year, we built a little German rock farmhouse off rock on the place.
[03:43:57.068 --> 03:44:07.872]  And this is where she gets mad at me because I tell people that we lived, we had kerosene light for the first year and I loved it because it was so historical, reading at night, kerosene light, and I'd just written the script for that Civil War movie.
[03:44:07.872 --> 03:44:11.313]  But unlike artificial light, it doesn't wake you up so you can't fall asleep at night.
[03:44:11.313 --> 03:44:13.234]  How do you feel about putting L.A.
[03:44:13.234 --> 03:44:14.134]  in the rearview mirror, Anita?
[03:44:14.912 --> 03:44:29.000]  It was a little harder for me, but I love where we are now, and I managed to get my grown kids to move here, and so all of our three children are here, grown kids and their children.
[03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:30.541]  So we have eight grandkids.
[03:44:30.541 --> 03:44:32.883]  They're all within the Austin area.
[03:44:32.883 --> 03:44:34.764]  So we're happy.
[03:44:35.464 --> 03:44:36.184]  That's great.
[03:44:36.184 --> 03:44:38.145]  And I see some eggs on your lap.
[03:44:38.145 --> 03:44:42.647]  Yes, I brought eggs for you and Alex.
[03:44:42.647 --> 03:44:46.908]  We have chickens, and these are our non-GMO eggs.
[03:44:46.908 --> 03:44:49.970]  I'm getting about a dozen a day, so I'm going to gift those to you.
[03:44:49.970 --> 03:44:50.450]  Oh, thank you.
[03:44:50.450 --> 03:44:52.711]  They're gorgeous orange yolks.
[03:44:52.711 --> 03:44:56.972]  We wanted to be the first people that ever gave you eggs on your show.
[03:44:56.972 --> 03:44:58.353]  First people that haven't thrown them at me.
[03:45:00.353 --> 03:45:00.773]  Well, that's great.
[03:45:00.773 --> 03:45:02.075]  You know, that's the key.
[03:45:02.075 --> 03:45:06.359]  Just as Alex was talking to Stuart Rhodes earlier, and he was saying, hey, you want to go?
[03:45:06.359 --> 03:45:10.924]  Yeah, look at how pretty they are, all the different colors from the different breeds there.
[03:45:10.924 --> 03:45:11.404]  He was saying...
[03:45:12.614 --> 03:45:14.916]  That you need to know people in your neighborhood.
[03:45:14.916 --> 03:45:17.578]  You need to start establishing local communities.
[03:45:17.578 --> 03:45:20.681]  And I think that's one of the key things I keep telling people over and over again.
[03:45:20.681 --> 03:45:24.164]  Let's stop looking to Washington for the solution.
[03:45:24.164 --> 03:45:30.249]  We need to start trying to see ways that we can locally solve our problems and block Washington out of our lives.
[03:45:30.249 --> 03:45:35.133]  And certainly putting the right people, sending the right people to Washington could help to block them out of our lives.
[03:45:35.133 --> 03:45:39.636]  But there's so many things we can do in terms of jury nullification, other things that we can do.
[03:45:39.636 --> 03:45:41.418]  But he's talking about, hey, know who you're
[03:45:41.758 --> 03:45:42.418]  We're getting better at it.
[03:45:42.418 --> 03:45:44.379]  It seems like it would be easy enough to grow a garden, and it is.
[03:45:44.379 --> 03:45:46.139]  Texas is a little tricky because of the heat and sometimes drought, but
[03:46:09.726 --> 03:46:15.470]  Last year, I've had a lot of tomatoes, zucchini, cucumber, everything you would need.
[03:46:15.470 --> 03:46:26.337]  It's just kind of a pure, more simple, I'd be happy to live in the 19th century, but it's a more simple way, less is more.
[03:46:26.337 --> 03:46:36.423]  We use wood stoves for heat, we use a windmill for water, and we have horses, and I have wire cutters in my saddlebags, which will make Texas open range.
[03:46:38.629 --> 03:46:41.172]  But the point is, it's just simpler.
[03:46:41.172 --> 03:46:41.973]  We don't have TV.
[03:46:41.973 --> 03:46:49.963]  We use Amish-made propane refrigerator because it doesn't draw the... We have solar panels, so we have electricity.
[03:46:49.963 --> 03:46:50.744]  That's great.
[03:46:50.744 --> 03:46:52.206]  Still have kerosene lights.
[03:46:52.206 --> 03:46:52.947]  We have internet.
[03:46:52.947 --> 03:46:54.509]  I mean, we do have the basics there.
[03:46:55.069 --> 03:46:57.291]  Well, you're an example and inspiration for all of us.
[03:46:57.291 --> 03:47:03.697]  I want to get back to the movie, because when you were here last time, we brought with you Mark Collins, who plays George Washington.
[03:47:03.697 --> 03:47:10.223]  And he's got a business card, has his face on one side of it and George Washington's on the other, and these guys are clones.
[03:47:10.223 --> 03:47:13.205]  I think he's like a 21st century clone of George Washington.
[03:47:13.205 --> 03:47:14.026]  Same size and everything.
[03:47:14.026 --> 03:47:15.227]  You've got him in this movie.
[03:47:15.227 --> 03:47:17.389]  You've got some great set pieces in this.
[03:47:17.389 --> 03:47:19.211]  You were at the Alamo that
[03:47:19.711 --> 03:47:23.773]  John Wayne had set up for the movie because, of course, the real Alamo is now surrounded in a city.
[03:47:23.773 --> 03:47:31.436]  It's been Agenda 21, the Alamo itself, so they went out in the woods, built one, and you got there and you were the last ones to film there before it burned down.
[03:47:31.436 --> 03:47:37.099]  Yeah, it was actually the one in Dripping Springs, so the Billy Bob Alamo was the last one.
[03:47:38.075 --> 03:47:46.680]  And when we filmed there, of course the movie set is all faux plaster stone and everything, and half the wall was falling off the element.
[03:47:46.680 --> 03:47:47.941]  We fixed that.
[03:47:47.941 --> 03:47:54.986]  And it wasn't two weeks or three weeks after we filmed there that lightning struck the field and the whole thing burned down.
[03:47:54.986 --> 03:48:06.113]  And that was an amazing blessing because I wanted to have reenactments and not just talking heads and bring some production value to this so that people would have a break from all the intensity.
[03:48:06.933 --> 03:48:27.322]  But to me, besides what Alex said about wearing your knees out praying and education, to me, the bottom line to the solution is what Travis said for real and what Travis says in the Alamo reenactment, and that is, no is a powerful concept.
[03:48:27.322 --> 03:48:28.803]  And that is the bottom line.
[03:48:28.803 --> 03:48:34.706]  If Americans are not willing to say no, then as so many people have said astutely, we deserve what we get.
[03:48:35.086 --> 03:48:35.466]  That's right.
[03:48:35.466 --> 03:48:40.430]  And you know, when we go back and we look at it, the entire Bill of Rights is a big no.
[03:48:40.430 --> 03:48:42.492]  It's to say to the government, no, you will not do this.
[03:48:42.492 --> 03:48:43.212]  No, you will not.
[03:48:43.212 --> 03:48:46.895]  It puts a line around what the federal government can do.
[03:48:46.895 --> 03:48:50.879]  And it says, oh, by the way, if we didn't tell you that you could do it, the answer is no.
[03:48:50.879 --> 03:48:51.799]  Still no.
[03:48:51.799 --> 03:48:52.140]  Okay?
[03:48:52.140 --> 03:48:53.621]  With the 9th and 10th Amendment.
[03:48:53.621 --> 03:48:54.862]  Barack Obama understood that.
[03:48:55.322 --> 03:48:59.544]  Barack Obama said, hey, you know, that's a concept we've always called negative rights.
[03:48:59.544 --> 03:49:04.605]  In other words, we have individual rights and we protect those rights by saying there's things that the government can't do.
[03:49:04.605 --> 03:49:06.546]  He goes, well, that's one idea of the Constitution.
[03:49:06.546 --> 03:49:09.607]  I prefer positive rights, which is what the socialists say.
[03:49:09.607 --> 03:49:11.928]  You have a right to education.
[03:49:11.928 --> 03:49:15.349]  You have a right to food or this or that, whatever they want to do.
[03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:16.950]  Things that they're going to provide for you.
[03:49:16.950 --> 03:49:19.211]  But of course they have to take that from other people.
[03:49:19.751 --> 03:49:24.314]  And that's the fundamental difference between socialism and libertarianism.
[03:49:24.314 --> 03:49:25.955]  And he understands that.
[03:49:25.955 --> 03:49:27.976]  He's not naive about that.
[03:49:27.976 --> 03:49:31.358]  And so many of these people do, and yet they just don't say no.
[03:49:31.358 --> 03:49:32.019]  None of them say no.
[03:49:32.870 --> 03:49:54.052]  Well, that and the thing that we see unfolding today of today's multiculturalism as opposed to the way it was in the 18th century is that so many people, and you know, like I said, as Christians we're to have empathy for all people, but as Americans we don't have to go with a multicultural concept whereby
[03:49:56.114 --> 03:50:04.480]  There are islands and enclaves of people that don't speak English, couldn't care less about the Constitution or our way of government, and do not assimilate.
[03:50:04.480 --> 03:50:06.101]  That is not American.
[03:50:06.101 --> 03:50:06.841]  Yeah, that's true.
[03:50:06.841 --> 03:50:09.403]  And if they don't want to play, they should go somewhere else.
[03:50:09.403 --> 03:50:09.803]  That's true.
[03:50:09.803 --> 03:50:23.633]  And if you bring people in... I heard the story that you told Alex about all your ancestors coming in, going past the Statue of Liberty, because, you know, when people come in, and we brought a large number of people in from Europe and other places during that period of time,
[03:50:24.522 --> 03:50:32.906]  But if you bring people in in such large numbers as we're bringing them in now in America and in Europe, you don't have a way to assimilate them.
[03:50:32.906 --> 03:50:39.449]  They will not assimilate, especially different religion, language, cultures are going to remain in their own ghettos.
[03:50:39.449 --> 03:50:41.010]  And that's the point, I think.
[03:50:41.010 --> 03:50:48.333]  They want to balkanize the countries rather than, you know, having not even a tossed salad, certainly not a melting pot, okay?
[03:50:48.333 --> 03:50:51.275]  They want to have a, I guess you could call it a bento box.
[03:50:52.008 --> 03:50:53.989]  But that's not going to work out too much for us.
[03:50:53.989 --> 03:50:54.649]  We're going to be right back.
[03:50:54.649 --> 03:50:59.590]  We're going to take some of your calls for Chuck Untersee and his wife, Anita, and the movie, Revelation.
[03:50:59.590 --> 03:51:09.574]  Extend your life with ExtendoVite, a seven-herb combination made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, hawthorn, ginkgo biloba, valerian, and milk thistle.

[03:51:13.715 --> 03:51:24.619]  Irregular heartbeats, chest pain, lower cholesterol, as well as normalized blood pressure and clean and strengthened arteries, plus much, much more.
[03:51:24.619 --> 03:51:32.221]  Doctors have taken people off of some or all of their pills just because they believe their patients got better while taking Xtendavide.
[03:51:32.501 --> 03:51:34.882]  Get the dependability of ExtendoVite.

[03:51:59.062 --> 03:52:06.265]  When Dr. Lane Sebring appeared on Fox News and claimed that he could give seniors a second shot at youth, viewers were highly skeptical.
[03:52:06.265 --> 03:52:08.085]  But then, they saw the proof.
[03:52:08.085 --> 03:52:15.088]  Despite being 61 years old, Dr. Sebring is still competing in martial arts competitions against guys half his age and winning.
[03:52:15.088 --> 03:52:18.669]  But what's even more remarkable are his lab tests that back it all up.
[03:52:18.669 --> 03:52:23.871]  His blood pressure checks in at a healthy 110 or 78, and his blood sugar never jumps above 70.
[03:52:24.571 --> 03:52:25.772]  So what's his secret?
[03:52:25.772 --> 03:52:31.034]  Sebring has been using a powerful green drink that he personally formulated called Patriot Power Greens.
[03:52:31.034 --> 03:52:37.257]  Patriot Power Greens was originally created to help older guys in the military who are dealing with achy joints and stiff muscles.
[03:52:37.257 --> 03:52:42.099]  And for a limited time, Dr. Sebring is letting you try the drink absolutely free.
[03:52:42.099 --> 03:52:44.900]  All he asks is that you chip in a few bucks to help cover shipping.
[03:52:45.160 --> 03:52:49.227]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.

[03:53:02.772 --> 03:53:04.735]  December 7th, 1941.
[03:53:04.735 --> 03:53:08.460]  A date which will live in infamy.
[03:53:08.460 --> 03:53:13.667]  75 years ago, America suffered one of the worst moments in American history.
[03:53:13.667 --> 03:53:15.349]  The attack on Pearl Harbor.

[03:54:11.604 --> 03:54:12.826]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:12.826 --> 03:54:16.089]  I'm David Nye and I'm here with Chuck Undersine and his wife Anita.
[03:54:16.089 --> 03:54:18.993]  They are the filmmakers of Revolution The Movie.
[03:54:18.993 --> 03:54:21.476]  You can find out information about that at RevolutionTheMovie.info.
[03:54:23.277 --> 03:54:26.140]  Revelation, yeah, what did I say?
[03:54:26.140 --> 03:54:27.301]  Oh, yeah, Revelation.
[03:54:27.301 --> 03:54:29.202]  No, Revelation the movie.
[03:54:29.202 --> 03:54:31.584]  Revelation, like the book in the Bible.
[03:54:31.584 --> 03:54:32.725]  Revelations.
[03:54:32.725 --> 03:54:37.509]  Revelationthemovie.info, and of course it's very important for you to support that.
[03:54:37.509 --> 03:54:41.353]  This is the way that you can get this film to a broader audience.
[03:54:41.353 --> 03:54:44.335]  They're going the same route that Dinesh D'Souza did with his movie 2016.
[03:54:46.141 --> 03:54:55.950]  Putting it in a limited number of theaters, the distribution people take a look at it, see how it does on a per-screen basis, and then they roll it out to a larger number of screens.
[03:54:55.950 --> 03:54:58.072]  That's the way we have to get our message out.
[03:54:58.072 --> 03:55:00.074]  We're not going to get it through the film festivals.
[03:55:00.074 --> 03:55:05.619]  We've just seen what happened with Vaxxed, shut out of that film festival, even though Robert De Niro personally wanted
[03:55:06.139 --> 03:55:07.319]  That information still does.
[03:55:07.319 --> 03:55:12.821]  Once that information to get out there, you're not going to get a movie like Revelation the movie.
[03:55:12.821 --> 03:55:16.142]  You're not going to get that through any of the film festivals as we pointed out.
[03:55:16.142 --> 03:55:18.762]  And I want to go back and take one of your calls at least.
[03:55:18.762 --> 03:55:20.883]  We'll have at least time for one of them.
[03:55:20.883 --> 03:55:24.484]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to let you know a way that you can support InfoWars as well.
[03:55:25.064 --> 03:55:29.046]  And that is, we try to help you and pass these savings back to you.

[03:56:07.898 --> 03:56:12.839]  Bill, your comment for the filmmakers of Revelation the movie.
[03:56:12.839 --> 03:56:16.420]  It is going to be revolutionary if we can get this out there, but it's Revelation the movie.
[03:56:16.420 --> 03:56:19.341]  Go ahead, Bill.
[03:56:19.341 --> 03:56:20.901]  You hear me?

[03:56:23.562 --> 03:56:24.482]  They must have heard me.
[03:56:24.482 --> 03:56:26.383]  My name is Jason from Texas.
[03:56:26.383 --> 03:56:26.763]  Oh, okay.
[03:56:27.904 --> 03:56:29.244]  Yeah, it's alright.
[03:56:29.244 --> 03:56:31.185]  Hey Chuck, Anita, it was great talking to you.
[03:56:31.185 --> 03:56:33.326]  Congratulations on the movie.
[03:56:33.326 --> 03:56:36.847]  And David, this is the first time I've got to talk to you.
[03:56:36.847 --> 03:56:37.807]  I'm excited.
[03:56:37.807 --> 03:56:39.468]  I love your input and everything.
[03:56:39.468 --> 03:56:46.810]  You know, I started listening to you guys a while back, and now my 10-year-old son has got to listening to InfoWars.
[03:56:46.810 --> 03:56:56.353]  And what he does now is every time I get my products in the mail, he takes the pocket constitutions and the bumper stickers and he hands them to his friends and his teachers at school.
[03:56:57.393 --> 03:57:00.417]  And, um, he, you know, he would love to watch this movie.
[03:57:00.417 --> 03:57:09.807]  We're about four hours from Houston, but is there like t-shirts or, um, any kind of things that he could get his hands on to share with his friends?
[03:57:09.807 --> 03:57:14.072]  You know, cause I think not only talking to the adults, but getting our children
[03:57:14.890 --> 03:57:42.896]  uh... educated about the constitution like i teach my sunday school class constitution along with the gospel and everything so they can no freedom on all aspects of life yes there is something on our website that might be helpful to use is very large and graphic is the theatrical poster you can get it through amazon is twenty seven by forty inches and it's the uh... the title of the film is the same thing that you'll see in theaters in the uh...
[03:57:44.797 --> 03:57:48.741]  And basically, it kind of tells the story.
[03:57:48.741 --> 03:57:55.987]  It's the fourth horseman of the apocalypse, the pale horse, with carrying an American flag as if from heaven.
[03:57:55.987 --> 03:58:03.153]  And with the title included, it tells the story pretty quickly, which is Revelation.
