[00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.066]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:14.892 --> 00:00:15.533]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.213 --> 00:00:17.234]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.975 --> 00:00:19.055]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:20.537]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.317 --> 00:00:22.218]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.858 --> 00:00:26.481]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.062 --> 00:00:31.125]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:42.963]  Well, I've got to be honest with folks, we've broken another record here.
[00:00:43.624 --> 00:00:44.927]  We seem to be doing it every week.
[00:00:45.227 --> 00:00:49.556]  There's never been this much insane, over-the-top news.
[00:00:50.956 --> 00:00:59.903]  You've got the Oregon situation with one dead, another wounded, the media lying and saying it was a shootout last night and today, then admitting it wasn't.
[00:01:01.304 --> 00:01:16.316]  You've got huge global developments with top generals and world leaders saying we're the closest to nuclear war we've ever been, with the doomsday clock with top experts and scientists conferring, saying it's the most dangerous it's ever been.
[00:01:17.357 --> 00:01:21.020]  We've got devastating attacks on free speech in the Western world.
[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.564]  We have got unbelievable rollouts of paramilitary force against the American people.
[00:01:27.044 --> 00:01:30.526]  We have the lowest approval rating ever for Congress and government in general.
[00:01:31.607 --> 00:01:35.750]  We have all sorts of new bizarre diseases popping up that appear to be weaponized.
[00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.392]  We've got proxy wars heating up.
[00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:43.695]  We have got just unbelievable information to cover today.
[00:01:44.116 --> 00:01:45.797]  You've got Bernie Sanders.
[00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:57.349]  Being invited by Obama to the White House, showing that they may actually go with him instead of bringing Biden in to bring down Hillary, and that the indictment of Hillary could be imminent.
[00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:02.894]  Tom DeLay, the former Republican whip, who's been through the ringer.
[00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:05.756]  And falsely charged with a bunch of garbage.
[00:02:05.836 --> 00:02:06.676]  Obviously defeated it.
[00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:08.436]  I'm not saying he was a good guy.
[00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:09.937]  He was just falsely charged with stuff.
[00:02:10.357 --> 00:02:11.477]  He wasn't going along with the agenda.
[00:02:11.737 --> 00:02:17.559]  He says she is going to be indicted or the FBI is going to go public and he wouldn't say that if that wasn't the case.
[00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:25.681]  All hell is about to break loose because the Clintons will run a false flag or they will pull out all the stops.
[00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:26.601]  I mean, they will.
[00:02:26.922 --> 00:02:28.202]  They will not go quietly.
[00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:41.694]  And so the fact that they're being moved towards the airlock and about to be thrown out into space, you know, like Sigourney Weaver does to the alien, this is hardcore.
[00:02:42.554 --> 00:02:45.055]  This is circus maximus.
[00:02:45.675 --> 00:02:48.556]  And I'll be honest with you, this has never happened to me.
[00:02:48.616 --> 00:02:50.656]  I woke up this morning and my jaw is locked.
[00:02:50.776 --> 00:02:52.257]  I can't even put my back teeth together.
[00:02:53.427 --> 00:02:57.151]  That's how much I was clenching my teeth last night in my dreams, worrying about all this.
[00:02:57.271 --> 00:02:58.172]  I mean, I go to sleep.
[00:02:58.232 --> 00:02:59.833]  I just worry about this now all night long.
[00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:09.223]  And that's because my gut, my gut, not just intellectually, knows we are in deep trouble.
[00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:13.247]  And we need to admit we're in deep trouble to get out of the deep trouble.
[00:03:13.487 --> 00:03:15.189]  And I want to say something to the feds and people.
[00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:26.196]  I know that most of the people in the federal government that are in the muscle end of things are conservatives or libertarians, and that your bosses are socialists and communists and drug dealers and scum.
[00:03:26.916 --> 00:03:36.604]  I know that you were naive getting into it, most of you are come from families, and you're part of a white hat crew that used to be the majority that's now probably only about 45%.
[00:03:37.565 --> 00:03:41.889]  I know they want to start a civil war that wipes you out, and that wipes the patriots out.
[00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.711]  I've done everything I can to try to stop this.
[00:03:46.806 --> 00:03:48.126]  And I'm telling the police that too.
[00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:54.788]  I've told the militias and everybody, don't act like idiots and don't let people manipulate you into stupid stuff and don't do stupid things.
[00:03:54.848 --> 00:04:01.750]  And I'm going to tell the police and the military and the feds, this isn't going to be a boss hog takeover.
[00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:04.771]  They're going to destroy the country.
[00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:08.552]  The globalists have got really bad stuff in store for everybody.
[00:04:08.912 --> 00:04:15.994]  So even if you're a sociopath, and I'm not saying you're all sociopaths or mercenaries, I'm saying some of you are,
[00:04:17.432 --> 00:04:20.836]  You really need to get a historical perspective and not be stupid.
[00:04:21.197 --> 00:04:34.772]  Hitler's general staff in 1943 and 1944 tried to take him out not because they were angels and not because they didn't have blood on their hands, many of them, but because they knew where it was taking Germany.
[00:04:35.782 --> 00:04:38.985]  And by 1943, there were only 3 or 4 million dead German troops.
[00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:39.866]  That sounds like a lot.
[00:04:39.986 --> 00:04:40.387]  It wasn't.
[00:04:40.987 --> 00:04:43.470]  At the end, it was 21 million Germans dead.
[00:04:44.031 --> 00:04:47.254]  That was about 30% of the German population.
[00:04:48.555 --> 00:04:51.719]  I'm telling you, just like I said I have a bad feeling about the Bundys yesterday,
[00:04:52.987 --> 00:04:54.409]  Yeah, folks, I'm psychic.
[00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:55.530]  I mean, it's a fact, okay?
[00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.791]  I mean, I don't control it.
[00:04:56.851 --> 00:04:57.472]  Nobody can.
[00:04:57.932 --> 00:04:59.153]  But, I mean, I knew something.
[00:04:59.173 --> 00:04:59.634]  I could just feel it.
[00:04:59.654 --> 00:05:01.075]  I said, something bad's about to happen.
[00:05:01.095 --> 00:05:01.636]  You notice it did.
[00:05:02.257 --> 00:05:04.619]  And I didn't have to have some contact tell me that.
[00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:07.262]  I'm telling you, we're all in deep trouble.
[00:05:09.206 --> 00:05:12.849]  You hear a lot about the cashless society, but Europeans aren't buying it.
[00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:21.795]  According to the European Central Bank, a record 1 trillion euros of banknotes were in circulation in 2015, almost double the value 10 years ago.
[00:05:22.115 --> 00:05:24.637]  Paper money in circulation rose 6.5% last year, the most since 2008.
[00:05:28.023 --> 00:05:32.744]  In 2008, people were worried about financial turbulence and crashing markets then with good reason.
[00:05:32.944 --> 00:05:37.305]  And this year has begun with the worst two-week start on record for financial markets.
[00:05:37.625 --> 00:05:47.508]  But in 2015, we now have negative interest rates on bank accounts and the risk of flat-out confiscation of accounts by government, what they call haircuts.
[00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:51.910]  And then there's privacy.
[00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.530]  Cashless?
[00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.911]  No thanks.
[00:05:54.111 --> 00:05:54.951]  Negative interest rates?
[00:05:55.332 --> 00:05:56.452]  Risk of confiscation?
[00:05:56.932 --> 00:05:58.013]  Economic uncertainty?
[00:05:58.613 --> 00:05:59.534]  I'll take it in cash.
[00:06:00.454 --> 00:06:04.876]  Paper notes may not be real money, but they sure beat negative interest and haircuts.
[00:06:05.617 --> 00:06:07.498]  For Prison Planet TV, I'm David Knight.
[00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:11.683]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:06:11.923 --> 00:06:14.085]  Deep Cleanse by InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:14.265 --> 00:06:20.989]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[00:07:08.724 --> 00:07:12.425]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:07:12.705 --> 00:07:18.827]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:07:19.008 --> 00:07:25.990]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:35.073]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[00:07:35.393 --> 00:07:41.317]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:07:41.557 --> 00:07:46.060]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.743]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:07:50.003 --> 00:07:51.604]  No needles, no injections.
[00:07:51.884 --> 00:07:53.425]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:07:53.525 --> 00:07:54.566]  Try it for yourself.

[00:08:07.054 --> 00:08:18.817]  Some heads are gonna roll.
[00:08:19.318 --> 00:08:23.439]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:08:24.159 --> 00:08:25.520]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:38.208 --> 00:09:02.619]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this key 27th day of January 2016 Wednesday edition will be here for the next four hours Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:04.100]  We have the original
[00:09:06.297 --> 00:09:11.960]  Benghazi whistleblower who retired about six months after Benghazi.
[00:09:12.821 --> 00:09:17.224]  He is of course a famous whistleblower from Iran-Contra.
[00:09:18.584 --> 00:09:19.825]  Robert Tosh Plumlee.
[00:09:21.366 --> 00:09:29.651]  He was on the quote White Hat side of the Central Intelligence Agency and famously flew weapons to Fidel Castro when he worked for Eisenhower.
[00:09:30.392 --> 00:09:35.775]  So he's been in covert operations since 1958 and he retired three years ago.
[00:09:37.014 --> 00:09:40.955]  He blew the entire operation of Benghazi wide open more than anyone else.
[00:09:42.467 --> 00:09:49.789]  And we received very serious death threats, he received threats, and the Justice Department came after him, but then backed off.
[00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:51.449]  He said, fine, go ahead and indict me.
[00:09:52.169 --> 00:10:00.291]  He'll be joining us at the bottom of the next hour with an update, because the new 13 Hours has come out, and of course covers the stand down and the rest of it.
[00:10:00.611 --> 00:10:10.533]  But everything he talked about, how she was using the export powers to secretly transfer weapons out of the State Department to different third world dictators that were paying her off,
[00:10:11.513 --> 00:10:12.573]  That was first here.
[00:10:13.173 --> 00:10:14.294]  By the way, we're not bragging.
[00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:15.954]  That's like sticking your head in a lion's mouth.
[00:10:16.394 --> 00:10:17.295]  It's a dangerous trick.
[00:10:19.155 --> 00:10:21.656]  And again, nobody else had the cojones to have him on.
[00:10:21.696 --> 00:10:25.157]  We did it because we don't have... You know, it's not about being macho, folks.
[00:10:25.177 --> 00:10:26.217]  It's about doing our job here.
[00:10:26.577 --> 00:10:28.578]  But I just want you to know this is a very serious broadcast.
[00:10:29.858 --> 00:10:33.559]  We used to have some humor on the show, and it's fun, and I still want to do it.
[00:10:34.439 --> 00:10:40.141]  I want to make fun of Bernie Sanders and stuff, but at a certain point, you know, it's just stuff's too hardcore.
[00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.071]  He's popping in.
[00:10:43.091 --> 00:10:46.293]  We're going to look at how they plan to steal the election from Trump.
[00:10:46.633 --> 00:10:59.523]  Huge article on InfoWars.com with top Bilderberg group member, Ed Davos, actually says the super elites, that's what they call themselves, the super class, that's what the Kissinger group calls them.
[00:10:59.543 --> 00:11:10.492]  I remember when the head of the Kissinger group told me, right in front of John Harmon, he said on the phone during a break, he said, look, just join us, Alex.
[00:11:11.687 --> 00:11:13.568]  Just join us, you're part of the superclass.
[00:11:14.068 --> 00:11:18.851]  Harman heard it, and I started laughing at the guy, and he said, I'm just gonna get off here.
[00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:23.073]  I thought if I was nice to you, you'd... And these people are just sick.
[00:11:23.153 --> 00:11:29.557]  Imagine how everybody else just, oh, you run trillions, you're being nice to me, let me get on my knees before you.
[00:11:30.137 --> 00:11:35.920]  Well, they say they're going after Trump, and that is the number one certification that he is good.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.641]  And they don't like it.
[00:11:39.855 --> 00:11:46.511]  And even if he's not perfect, they know that they don't run him and that he actually wants to run things and that scares the daylights out of them.
[00:11:47.847 --> 00:11:52.190]  And they also obviously have Trump's phones tapped, his email tapped, and everything else.
[00:11:52.571 --> 00:11:59.936]  And I don't want to really give the media something to go into hissy fits about, but they already pretty much have.
[00:11:59.956 --> 00:12:04.680]  We've heard him tweeting out InfoWars links and saying he likes InfoWars and I'm a nice guy and stuff like that.
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:09.964]  Trump's getting a crash course, just like Vladimir Putin is, from this show.
[00:12:10.444 --> 00:12:10.965]  Just a fact.
[00:12:12.329 --> 00:12:16.153]  You see us influencing major TV shows, you know, Drudge is a daily listener.
[00:12:16.874 --> 00:12:24.341]  We have to admit that InfoWars has the ear of the intelligentsia and of the cultural elite, and of the bad guys as well.
[00:12:25.743 --> 00:12:32.710]  But they're coming after Trump because he's learning about the globalists of the New World Order, and he's pretty freaked out about it, quite frankly.
[00:12:33.851 --> 00:12:34.652]  And they now know.
[00:12:38.052 --> 00:12:41.855]  That's why they went after Rand Paul and said, how dare you be an Alex Jones guy?
[00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:43.036]  How dare you be part of it?
[00:12:43.056 --> 00:12:44.878]  You know, and back when he was, Alex is great.
[00:12:44.918 --> 00:12:45.058]  Yeah.
[00:12:45.078 --> 00:12:45.838]  He's supposed to build a burger.
[00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:46.499]  I love Alex.
[00:12:46.819 --> 00:12:48.961]  Then they convinced him to kind of distance himself.
[00:12:49.181 --> 00:12:59.510]  And then his stock went down like rotten milk, you know, being thrown out and he's not rotten milk, but just the fact that he tried to be a little bit established when everybody ran from him.
[00:13:00.612 --> 00:13:19.477]  Trump is smart enough to know that being anti-establishment is the touchstone, the zeitgeist, and so wading into the info war, testing it up to his knees, perhaps preparing to fully immerse himself in it, has got them in fits.
[00:13:20.017 --> 00:13:23.118]  I don't want to put ourselves at the center of this, but we are a large part of it.
[00:13:23.698 --> 00:13:27.239]  You are part of it as well, but that's the inside baseball if you just want to know.
[00:13:29.255 --> 00:13:43.281]  So Richard Reeves is going to tape a special report that's going to be on the nightly news tonight that I'm going to air sections of it tomorrow with an expert on how they're trying to steal the delegate process and the parliamentary systems are going to try to do it and then they're in the news bragging about it but we're going to get into the inside technicals of that.
[00:13:45.101 --> 00:13:56.506]  Now obviously there has been a tragedy in Oregon and there's a lot of angles to this and so I am going to calmly go over it here in just a few minutes.
[00:13:59.966 --> 00:14:00.886]  It's very, very sad.
[00:14:04.227 --> 00:14:07.087]  Some of the people involved in this are heroes.
[00:14:08.127 --> 00:14:13.468]  They selflessly meant well, but they were not sophisticated and walked into a trap.
[00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:27.111]  And so, if I was in the military and I was commanding a group of scouts, if I was a sergeant commanding a platoon,
[00:14:29.468 --> 00:14:32.150]  And then my men wanted to go up a hill and attack an enemy.
[00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.552]  I'd say, no, we're going to wait until they come off the hill.
[00:14:34.572 --> 00:14:36.693]  We're going to go around behind him and get intel.
[00:14:36.713 --> 00:14:38.874]  Or we're going to attack him in the middle of the night.
[00:14:38.894 --> 00:14:40.716]  We're not going to attack him at high noon and go up the hill.
[00:14:41.877 --> 00:14:42.517]  It wouldn't be.
[00:14:42.737 --> 00:14:43.498]  I'm a traitor.
[00:14:45.459 --> 00:14:46.840]  I want to work with the enemy.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.624]  I don't want to see the men shot up and defeated and destroyed.
[00:14:54.585 --> 00:15:06.751]  But so many times, people that haven't been involved in politics, haven't been involved in studying guerrilla warfare, studying political operations, any of it, they just show up and just know all about it!
[00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:12.593]  Because they got 20 cows and 4 foster kids and, you know, they know how to do everything!
[00:15:13.774 --> 00:15:18.576]  They write a novel about, you know, it's gonna take blood and a revolution to fix things.
[00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:26.724]  That's exactly why the globalists are trying to provocateur a revolution, because that's not what we need in this country.
[00:15:29.071 --> 00:15:48.820]  Until we've exhausted every peaceful means, then if we've actually exhausted political means, if you're willing to go and fight and die and be killed, what are you going to do first, energy-wise, politically, if you put energy into things with the same energy you'd use to go die?
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.721]  Our problems would be over very, very quickly.
[00:15:52.421 --> 00:15:56.043]  I have put the energy for 21 years of someone willing to die
[00:15:57.336 --> 00:15:59.578]  Ready to die, into an information war.
[00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:05.383]  And I'm fully ready to be shut up, fully ready to be put in prison, fully ready to be killed.
[00:16:05.783 --> 00:16:22.077]  But, when it happens, I'll do my best, if it happens, to have it be just like the archetype of the martyr, lower my hands and let Darth Vader cut me right in half.
[00:16:23.198 --> 00:16:24.179]  Then, I win.
[00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:27.711]  Then that death means something.
[00:16:28.171 --> 00:16:32.175]  Then that death is worth millions dying in a fight.
[00:16:32.815 --> 00:16:34.837]  But you have to build the consciousness.
[00:16:35.097 --> 00:16:36.699]  You have to build the system.
[00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:38.721]  You have to build the personality.
[00:16:38.941 --> 00:16:41.083]  You have to build the sacrifice.
[00:16:41.924 --> 00:16:44.366]  And make the sacrifice great.
[00:16:44.867 --> 00:16:48.210]  And make the sacrifice loved when it's destroyed.
[00:16:51.067 --> 00:17:01.134]  As they try to assassinate my character, as they try to kill my name, it's already a martyr-level event, which humans admire at a deep primitive level.
[00:17:02.575 --> 00:17:05.477]  We're in sophisticated information warfare with the enemy.
[00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.761]  And do any of these rural groups and others ever listen to me?
[00:17:10.841 --> 00:17:15.865]  Yeah, a lot of times they do, but other times they send in the provocateurs, the expert technicians,
[00:17:17.247 --> 00:17:25.449]  Just like Atari Militia, they did fake arrest of the Feds, and you know, keep them for a few months, they're really not even at the jail, then let them out the back.
[00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:29.830]  That's what we've got to watch with the people in jail right now very closely.
[00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:34.752]  I told you to watch Atari, you watch with this.
[00:17:35.912 --> 00:17:37.672]  The Bundys are not the operatives.
[00:17:39.033 --> 00:17:42.274]  You can listen to them, take one look at them, we know where they came from.
[00:17:42.574 --> 00:17:43.634]  They're good people.
[00:17:46.544 --> 00:17:49.568]  But they wouldn't have been the George Washington's leading the fight.
[00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:52.933]  They would have been the guys in the trenches.
[00:17:55.476 --> 00:17:56.998]  They are not generals.
[00:18:00.743 --> 00:18:02.686]  They're led around by their noses.
[00:18:08.086 --> 00:18:23.679]  They feel it's right the Feds are stealing property, acting like thugs, so they have a right to go and do what they did, but they did it in a swamp, when the enemy's up on cliffs, just hammering the daylights out of them, walking into a complete trap.
[00:18:23.719 --> 00:18:25.541]  I'm gonna skip this network break, this is so important.
[00:18:28.383 --> 00:18:29.484]  And it's very, very sad.
[00:18:34.328 --> 00:18:35.369]  It's very, very painful.
[00:18:38.206 --> 00:18:41.869]  To see this unfold and I'm going to go over it at the bottom of the hour.
[00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.112]  We'll put their mug shots up on screen for folks.
[00:18:44.132 --> 00:18:49.496]  And I'm going to have Joe Biggs come in as well and discuss this with me.
[00:18:49.517 --> 00:18:50.658]  He can just come sit in here with me.
[00:18:52.479 --> 00:18:53.600]  Because he went there and covered it.
[00:18:53.881 --> 00:19:03.690]  And I think we probably didn't send David Knight or him out there now in the aftermath because we're going to learn very quickly whether they're going to be able to send in foundation operatives
[00:19:05.299 --> 00:19:12.623]  Who will try to start a civil war over something like this versus factions of the Feds that are clearly not trying to escalate this.
[00:19:12.663 --> 00:19:14.904]  See, there's different factions.
[00:19:14.924 --> 00:19:17.986]  There's at least seven factions we know of in the CIA.
[00:19:18.606 --> 00:19:20.467]  Three major factions in the NSA.
[00:19:21.047 --> 00:19:25.170]  Different administrations come in and try to create new factions or take over other ones.
[00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.391]  There's Army versus CIA.
[00:19:27.671 --> 00:19:29.132]  There's Navy versus Army.
[00:19:31.233 --> 00:19:32.854]  There's the Marine Corps, standalone.
[00:19:34.735 --> 00:19:36.016]  There's defense intelligence.
[00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:40.358]  There's the big megabanks above it trying to control and manipulate it all.
[00:19:40.398 --> 00:19:41.839]  Then there's international factions.
[00:19:42.339 --> 00:19:45.320]  It's not just, let's go have a war with the feds!
[00:19:45.881 --> 00:19:48.102]  Let's have it start here like the Alamo!
[00:19:52.344 --> 00:19:59.808]  You know that they planned with President Andrew Jackson in 1835
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.262]  A year out what they did in Texas.
[00:20:06.042 --> 00:20:18.892]  You know they sent Colonel Travis, this is inside baseball but it's leaked out here and there but this is confirmed, down to the Alamo to fight 10 to 1 odds to die.
[00:20:20.973 --> 00:20:26.658]  To create a chain reaction to give birth to Texas because they were hardcore folks.
[00:20:27.868 --> 00:20:36.910]  And they were Christians, but they basically followed a Rosicrucian founding father basic cult deal.
[00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:51.773]  Where they really wanted to found the new Atlantis, they really wanted to build a new civilization based on human empowerment, and they wanted to die in sacrifice against tyranny.
[00:20:52.833 --> 00:20:55.394]  They don't really make people like that anymore, much do they?
[00:20:57.014 --> 00:20:59.895]  And they went and they basically planned it and they knew it.
[00:20:59.995 --> 00:21:02.677]  And then Travis told the men, you're all going to die.
[00:21:03.057 --> 00:21:05.038]  Step across the line and join me in history.
[00:21:05.498 --> 00:21:06.858]  And they stepped across just like the 300.
[00:21:06.918 --> 00:21:18.483]  They planned with Andrew Jackson, an event similar to that.
[00:21:18.904 --> 00:21:21.665]  They didn't know exactly how it would go down a year before.
[00:21:22.952 --> 00:21:29.514]  And then they found Travis who'd already won some battles and was a born leader to lead it.
[00:21:31.015 --> 00:21:44.980]  And he wrote on that letter to my family when he left his son with the Ayers family, my mom's side, and said, take care of my little boy.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.962]  And then he wrote the other letter and said, I'm not giving up victory or death.
[00:21:52.347 --> 00:21:55.608]  And they hoped to get reinforcements, but they knew they weren't coming.
[00:21:56.689 --> 00:22:04.172]  And they knew where they were going, and they knew that they were coming to draw Santa Ana into the South, so they could get ready in the East with the armies.
[00:22:07.853 --> 00:22:18.778]  With Sam Houston, under the direct command of President Andrew Jackson, in a covert action of the United States of America, to take a third of Mexico.
[00:22:20.285 --> 00:22:21.565]  That's how you plan things.
[00:22:21.846 --> 00:22:22.866]  That's how you win.
[00:22:23.186 --> 00:22:26.547]  That's how you kick the British Empire's butt that nobody can stop.
[00:22:27.267 --> 00:22:31.088]  Real planning, real sacrifice, real long-term commitment.
[00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:39.471]  Not ten guys in camo and, you know, three of them are, I mean, you know, right out of the, you know, where.
[00:22:39.931 --> 00:22:44.913]  And then you got, you know, other fed ops running around, running textbook brainwashing on people.
[00:22:49.073 --> 00:22:50.694]  I just told everybody, get out of there.
[00:22:50.814 --> 00:22:56.636]  And Joel Skousen and all the rest of them said, you need to get out of there right now.
[00:22:57.877 --> 00:23:01.319]  You need to get out of there as quickly as you can.
[00:23:02.759 --> 00:23:06.141]  You need to use this to move on.
[00:23:06.521 --> 00:23:08.602]  You've had your victory in Nevada.
[00:23:09.222 --> 00:23:10.603]  The globalists hate you for it.
[00:23:10.643 --> 00:23:11.623]  You're going to be shut up.
[00:23:11.943 --> 00:23:12.964]  It's going to end badly.
[00:23:13.824 --> 00:23:17.826]  And now they're going to try to use this tragedy, and they probably did execute him,
[00:23:20.854 --> 00:23:28.680]  This Mr. Lavoie, who looks like a good man, who meant well, but had a martyr complex, and has gotten what he wanted.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.982]  I can read his quotes from his book, and his public statements.
[00:23:33.303 --> 00:23:43.531]  And then you've got some of these other people bringing their daughters, and there's witnesses, young women are witnesses to this, and I believe them, that they got him out, he jumps out and says, go ahead and shoot me, and they just shot him.
[00:23:44.975 --> 00:23:47.517]  Other people are saying he was on his knees, his hands behind his head.
[00:23:47.957 --> 00:23:53.520]  Well, no, the witnesses that were there are saying that he got out and he had his hands up and they shot him.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.241]  It's horrible.
[00:23:56.282 --> 00:24:01.165]  But you're going to hand Obama and the globalists everything they want.
[00:24:04.907 --> 00:24:05.568]  If there's any
[00:24:06.809 --> 00:24:11.995]  Tit for tat, if the, you know, if Feds get shot in the back of the head while they're pumping gas or whatever.
[00:24:12.795 --> 00:24:15.138]  You have no idea who that is you're gonna go walk up and shoot.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:25.169]  You have no idea how many of those people are on our side and do not like what's happening and are trying to leak information to stop what's going on.
[00:24:26.479 --> 00:24:31.386]  The bad ones are the bureaucrats up there bragging at the BLM, yeah we steal property!
[00:24:32.507 --> 00:24:42.281]  And then those 350 pound goblins send the men to go then intimidate and hurt everyone.
[00:24:43.002 --> 00:24:43.643]  It's disgusting.
[00:24:47.725 --> 00:24:55.308]  And I cut my teeth exposing what happened at Waco, and bullhorning the judge, and going over it all, and what they did there was terrible.
[00:24:55.328 --> 00:24:57.709]  They wanted to start a fight with the American people at that point.
[00:24:57.929 --> 00:25:04.252]  But folks got so upset and didn't buy into calling them a cult, and the rest of it, that they had to back off, and it blew up in their face.
[00:25:04.472 --> 00:25:12.476]  So then they pulled Oklahoma City to demonize the Liberty Movement, and their same agent was in Waco, and was at Oklahoma City.
[00:25:13.496 --> 00:25:15.337]  And when he didn't want to blow up a daycare center,
[00:25:17.466 --> 00:25:28.495]  When McVeigh didn't want to blow up a daycare center, they set him up and drugged his butt that day and had him found by the state police on the side of the highway.
[00:25:29.616 --> 00:25:39.404]  And you know the governor's brother wrote a book one year before where the federal building is bombed by a Tom McVeigh.
[00:25:40.905 --> 00:25:43.587]  And he dedicated the book to the secret circle.
[00:25:45.889 --> 00:25:46.770]  You see this is all
[00:25:48.018 --> 00:25:54.544]  Different religious orders, folks, battling each other over what controls America.
[00:25:54.844 --> 00:26:03.693]  And you've got the dark side, Luciferian, 1776 copycat group that ran the French Revolution, Adam Weishaupt.
[00:26:05.515 --> 00:26:13.141]  Trying to create a false Illuminati, or the Light, Liberty, God, and overtake it.
[00:26:13.222 --> 00:26:18.366]  And George Washington wrote about this in at least nine different letters before he died.
[00:26:18.666 --> 00:26:20.788]  Probably poisoned, we know they bled him to death.
[00:26:22.309 --> 00:26:28.835]  Because he was getting ready to lead a movement in the Masonic Order.
[00:26:30.742 --> 00:26:35.844]  To kick the devil-worshipping Illuminati out of it that was trying to take it over.
[00:26:36.184 --> 00:26:38.305]  I mean, you want to know the big secrets, folks?
[00:26:38.465 --> 00:26:39.005]  This is it.
[00:26:39.245 --> 00:26:40.185]  And it's there in history.
[00:26:41.806 --> 00:26:42.806]  Pieces here and there.
[00:26:43.186 --> 00:26:44.567]  And given down through lore.
[00:26:47.588 --> 00:26:50.789]  Through the lore of places like the Lone Star State.
[00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.991]  The state meant to defend the Republic till the end.
[00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:04.476]  The state meant to be a redoubt in the future if the enemy was able to take over the rest of the country.
[00:27:05.837 --> 00:27:10.801]  These covert wars have been going on since before this country was founded.
[00:27:17.788 --> 00:27:23.233]  And these are the type of secrets you learn if you're in the right lodge and a 33rd degree mason.
[00:27:28.502 --> 00:27:30.642]  It's not the secrets of Solomon's Temple.
[00:27:38.184 --> 00:27:44.585]  So I'm going to get into the big news that this Bundy tragedy distracts from.
[00:27:45.525 --> 00:27:57.667]  But I hope this doesn't just continue to unravel and become something to demonize the Liberty Movement and that they don't carry out some type of New Oklahoma City and blame it
[00:27:59.321 --> 00:28:00.202]  On the Patriots.
[00:28:00.882 --> 00:28:14.454]  And we've got Democrat internal talking papers and points that came out years ago, even on Fox News, five years ago, that they're planning a new Oklahoma City to be blamed on the Liberty Movement if the Tea Party tries to take back the Congress.
[00:28:17.116 --> 00:28:19.538]  Violence is not the answer at this point.
[00:28:21.059 --> 00:28:24.823]  You have a total right to defensively defend yourself, but not offensively.
[00:28:26.304 --> 00:28:27.225]  And we need to be smart
[00:28:28.203 --> 00:28:34.068]  We need to demand the squad car videos of the state police and the feds be released immediately if they didn't execute this guy.
[00:28:34.809 --> 00:28:45.157]  We need to have other folks, because they supposedly have still surrounded the facility, there's still people inside, including some people's daughters.
[00:28:45.758 --> 00:28:54.085]  You don't bring your daughter to something if you're, you know, writing news articles and giving speeches about how you're ready to die.
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:07.336]  And then it's a magnet for crazies where they're arresting drunks, pulling up, getting out, saying, I'm going to kill cops, and falling down, and weirdos in sumo wrestler outfits, and people stealing federal vehicles.
[00:29:08.577 --> 00:29:13.164]  You couldn't write a script better to make the Liberty Movement look bad.
[00:29:18.683 --> 00:29:26.588]  And then people in the middle of it who mean well committed not knowing how they're being set up saying, we've got to stay the course no matter what.
[00:29:28.289 --> 00:29:31.011]  We've got to stay right here.
[00:29:33.473 --> 00:29:39.637]  And no matter what goes on or how many provocateurs come in to make us look like idiots, we've got to just sit here and stay the course.
[00:29:40.802 --> 00:29:42.363]  That's not military thinking.
[00:29:42.723 --> 00:29:44.225]  That's not historical thinking.
[00:29:45.065 --> 00:29:47.007]  That's how you get destroyed.
[00:29:47.387 --> 00:29:53.792]  And so I must say, you don't speak for us in the Liberty Movement, for anyone that agrees with Alex Jones.
[00:29:53.852 --> 00:29:56.133]  We're going to come back with a huge World War 4 news.
[00:29:56.394 --> 00:29:57.314]  It's mainstream news.
[00:29:57.414 --> 00:29:58.155]  It's over the top.
[00:29:58.195 --> 00:29:59.056]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.536 --> 00:30:01.137]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.078 --> 00:30:04.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:08.834 --> 00:30:18.098]  During a news conference before addressing a large crowd in Iowa, Donald Trump expressed irritation that Fox News planned to leave Megyn Kelly as moderator of the Thursday night GOP debate.
[00:30:18.439 --> 00:30:21.440]  Megyn Kelly's really biased against me.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:21.940]  I know that.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.141]  Everybody knows that.
[00:30:23.381 --> 00:30:25.722]  Do you really think she can be fair at a debate?
[00:30:25.782 --> 00:30:29.664]  To which Fox News replied that he doesn't get to pick the journalists.
[00:30:30.004 --> 00:30:32.685]  They can't toy with me like they toy with everybody else.
[00:30:33.045 --> 00:30:34.186]  I won't be doing the debate.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.260]  A smart move.
[00:30:35.701 --> 00:30:44.845]  After Rand Paul was arbitrarily excluded by Fox Business, Paul held his own event on social media as the debate was occurring and he trended number one on Twitter.
[00:30:45.105 --> 00:30:49.928]  Donald Trump now plans on holding a live event simultaneously with the debate on Thursday night.
[00:30:50.268 --> 00:30:58.433]  InfoWars reporters will be live at the Trump event in Iowa as part of our live debate coverage of the last debate before the first votes are cast on Monday.
[00:30:58.833 --> 00:31:04.817]  Join us for live analysis and coverage of both events beginning Thursday at 7 central, 8 p.m.

[00:31:26.292 --> 00:31:31.936]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.

[00:31:41.498 --> 00:31:47.339]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:31:47.719 --> 00:31:54.120]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:59.521]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[00:33:19.432 --> 00:33:20.934]  This is our land.
[00:33:24.058 --> 00:33:27.342]  These are our people.
[00:33:27.382 --> 00:33:28.123]  The workers.
[00:33:28.163 --> 00:33:29.965]  The strivers.
[00:33:31.231 --> 00:33:37.716]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:59.156 --> 00:34:01.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:09.672 --> 00:34:10.994]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:11.875 --> 00:34:12.997]  This is the InfoWar.
[00:34:13.638 --> 00:34:14.720]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:34:17.853 --> 00:34:24.476]  The Bundys are a microcosm, as I've said many times, and if you understand what's happening to them, you understand what's happening across the board.
[00:34:25.257 --> 00:34:28.198]  And I'm going to get back into that with Joe Biggs here in about 10 minutes.
[00:34:28.238 --> 00:34:33.241]  He's there in the news center and is going to be coming in to join us.
[00:34:33.261 --> 00:34:38.784]  But before I go any further, let me get into the other news we're going to be covering throughout the broadcast.
[00:34:40.618 --> 00:34:41.819]  I'm going to get to some of this in a moment.
[00:34:41.959 --> 00:34:45.421]  Doomsday clock, world more dangerous than during Cold War.
[00:34:45.501 --> 00:34:53.387]  That's the Hill newspaper with a consortium of former top generals, scientists and others saying it's the closest to doomsday it's ever been.
[00:34:53.927 --> 00:34:55.909]  How many times have I told you that the last three years?
[00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:59.812]  And that's also what a lot of top military are saying behind the scenes.
[00:35:01.573 --> 00:35:03.554]  You know, my dad takes serious what I say.
[00:35:03.574 --> 00:35:04.315]  He's a smart guy.
[00:35:06.894 --> 00:35:13.940]  Highly educated, informed, been around the world, but he was at an event with a bunch of former generals.
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:24.788]  Because they were involved in trying to put nutraceuticals through the FDA so they could actually obviously patent it and then have it as a nutraceutical because he's been involved in that a long time.
[00:35:25.629 --> 00:35:28.051]  And my dad was sitting there talking to multi-star generals.
[00:35:28.071 --> 00:35:29.232]  They're like, we listen to your son every day.
[00:35:29.252 --> 00:35:30.353]  He's absolutely dead on target.
[00:35:30.573 --> 00:35:32.615]  We don't know how he has all this intel and information.
[00:35:32.635 --> 00:35:33.616]  He must have incredible sources.
[00:35:33.896 --> 00:35:35.057]  We can't believe they haven't killed him yet.
[00:35:35.338 --> 00:35:38.320]  And my dad came to me and he said, man, these guys were talking for like an hour about all this.
[00:35:38.901 --> 00:35:40.863]  And he was like, wow, so you're really that accurate?
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.564]  And then it was weird, like ever since then he doesn't even argue with me anymore.
[00:35:45.105 --> 00:35:51.796]  And it's weird to have your father, his father's kind of automatically argue with their sons, now he's 66 years old, but...
[00:35:53.379 --> 00:35:54.020]  It's just weird.
[00:35:55.181 --> 00:35:56.001]  But it's not that.
[00:35:56.222 --> 00:35:57.122]  I'm immersed in it.
[00:35:57.182 --> 00:35:58.283]  We have the contacts.
[00:35:58.504 --> 00:36:00.045]  We figured out the operation.
[00:36:00.245 --> 00:36:01.266]  We know the plan.
[00:36:01.566 --> 00:36:06.511]  We don't know exactly when they're going to execute or in what order, but man, it just is unbelievable.
[00:36:07.111 --> 00:36:08.352]  So it's not that special.
[00:36:09.053 --> 00:36:09.834]  I'm not that special.
[00:36:09.914 --> 00:36:12.276]  I just was immersed in it and we have the connections.
[00:36:14.898 --> 00:36:17.601]  Like my father educated me when I was young and others.
[00:36:19.005 --> 00:36:20.486]  And the John Birch Society and others.
[00:36:20.546 --> 00:36:21.366]  So we know now.
[00:36:22.186 --> 00:36:23.507]  And so the info's out.
[00:36:23.567 --> 00:36:24.587]  People don't have to believe us.
[00:36:24.828 --> 00:36:28.289]  They can look at our research, see the angles, and then see it for themselves.
[00:36:29.129 --> 00:36:31.791]  And you may see it clearer than we do and give us more intel.
[00:36:31.831 --> 00:36:34.592]  That's what's happening as we're exponentially learning more.
[00:36:36.243 --> 00:36:42.144]  I look at the mistakes I made 15 years ago, 20 years ago, the dumb things I did, how I helped the enemy in so many ways.
[00:36:42.284 --> 00:36:46.165]  We hurt them more than we helped them, but now we're getting to where we just hurt them.
[00:36:46.465 --> 00:36:49.306]  I mean, it's like 99% hammer their head in the ground.
[00:36:50.246 --> 00:36:51.946]  We connect with a political punch.
[00:36:52.066 --> 00:36:52.946]  It's jawbreaker.
[00:36:55.507 --> 00:36:57.147]  20 years ago, I was slapping them on the wrist.
[00:36:57.407 --> 00:36:58.608]  Now it's hammer!
[00:37:00.984 --> 00:37:04.508]  We have the moves that will hammer the enemy to hell.
[00:37:05.108 --> 00:37:06.590]  And we want you to come and join us.
[00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:09.893]  And look, take everything we do, copy it, I don't care.
[00:37:10.534 --> 00:37:17.921]  My problem is like a Glenn Beck, we've had for three years, Mystery Political Science Theater 3000, that's our exact name.
[00:37:18.602 --> 00:37:29.851]  On record, for covering debates and State of the Unions, they now call it that and do the exact same thing, while trying to demonize us and get us off stations and shut us down.
[00:37:30.451 --> 00:37:33.914]  I mean, I'll talk to station owners who are like, yeah, those Beck people don't like being on the same station.
[00:37:33.934 --> 00:37:40.719]  They're threatening to... It's like, man, you're trying to, like, be me, misrepresent what we are, and then bury me like a body snatcher?
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:45.003]  I'm not laying down next to you and going to sleep while you put the pod next to me!
[00:37:46.038 --> 00:38:00.002]  And I'm not bragging about M4 Wars or Alex Jones, I'm just saying we've hit the zeitgeist to the level that people literally plagiarize in front of everyone while trying to put me politically under the ground pushing daisies.
[00:38:01.022 --> 00:38:02.423]  No, no you're not.
[00:38:04.163 --> 00:38:06.784]  No you're not, and I just cannot believe the arrogance.
[00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:08.771]  But I'm digressing.
[00:38:09.451 --> 00:38:16.097]  Big Brain's putting a clip together showing this of the show going back three years calling it, you know, it was actually my idea and Rob Dewey came up with it.
[00:38:16.197 --> 00:38:17.939]  I said, you know, like mystery science theater.
[00:38:17.959 --> 00:38:19.240]  And he goes, political science theater.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.462]  And I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.
[00:38:22.369 --> 00:38:24.330]  Quite frankly though, you stole the wrong name.
[00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:25.491]  We're actually changing the name.
[00:38:25.511 --> 00:38:27.653]  I don't think people pretty much understand that.
[00:38:28.594 --> 00:38:30.635]  Though it is kind of comedy what we do, it's more serious.
[00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:33.017]  So we're already trying to come up with a new name for doing that.
[00:38:33.297 --> 00:38:34.678]  Now the Young Turks are doing the same thing.
[00:38:34.698 --> 00:38:35.959]  That's fine because they didn't copy the name.
[00:38:36.559 --> 00:38:39.862]  Just can't you people innovate or trailblaze anything yourselves?
[00:38:41.323 --> 00:38:44.045]  But I don't care if you copy what we do and give us no credit.
[00:38:44.385 --> 00:38:45.626]  Just don't try to destroy me.
[00:38:46.827 --> 00:38:47.387]  It's uncool.
[00:38:47.687 --> 00:38:49.549]  I mean, you can crap on me, just don't rub it in.
[00:38:51.323 --> 00:38:52.504]  You know, it's like a full metal jacket.
[00:38:52.924 --> 00:38:58.829]  Quote, I don't want it to be a family show, but... You know, I bet you're the type of guy that would such-and-such and not even give somebody a you-know-what!
[00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:00.870]  You know?
[00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:02.292]  Just, come on!
[00:39:02.732 --> 00:39:04.573]  Have some basic decency.
[00:39:08.236 --> 00:39:11.339]  But I guess if you're gonna steal from somebody, you gotta knock them on the head.
[00:39:11.399 --> 00:39:13.340]  I guess that's kinda what goes with the territory.
[00:39:13.961 --> 00:39:15.402]  Now, let me get into the really serious news.
[00:39:18.117 --> 00:39:20.878]  Doomsday clock, world more dangerous than during Cold War.
[00:39:20.978 --> 00:39:21.418]  Oh boy!
[00:39:23.139 --> 00:39:26.201]  Fed rate meeting, global stock market volatility puts U.S.
[00:39:26.241 --> 00:39:27.321]  banks on the hot seat.
[00:39:28.902 --> 00:39:30.943]  France declares permanent police state.
[00:39:32.023 --> 00:39:37.305]  Just totally announces it, no freedom, take your money, arrest you to protect you from the Muslims they brought in.
[00:39:38.546 --> 00:39:42.768]  Sweden's army chief warns World War III inside Europe within a few years.
[00:39:44.409 --> 00:39:45.329]  We already have U.S.
[00:39:45.389 --> 00:39:50.592]  troops in battle with Russian Special Forces Spetsnaz going back a year ago in Ukraine.
[00:39:50.612 --> 00:39:52.552]  I mean, that's just over-the-top crazy.
[00:39:54.073 --> 00:39:59.875]  France's highways descend into chaos and lawlessness as millions of Islamists run around robbing everyone.
[00:40:00.255 --> 00:40:01.796]  This total socialist collapse.
[00:40:03.985 --> 00:40:10.211]  And again, they bring in the French Revolution collapse worldwide, then out of it they give you an imperial leader like Napoleon.
[00:40:11.232 --> 00:40:14.316]  That's why they don't want Trump, because they think he might be trying to beat them to the pass.
[00:40:16.638 --> 00:40:27.169]  Report DHS incapable of accurately reporting visa overstays, but don't worry, they're good at getting a guy out of a pickup truck in Oregon and shooting him between the eyes.
[00:40:29.031 --> 00:40:32.353]  And just feds, you think your pension funds will be any good acting like this?
[00:40:32.513 --> 00:40:34.854]  You think there's any future when you've done stuff like this?
[00:40:35.695 --> 00:40:38.836]  You think you can just get away with evil forever and nothing's going to happen to you?
[00:40:39.297 --> 00:40:39.937]  Because here's the deal.
[00:40:40.217 --> 00:40:43.599]  These people were led around by their noses and manipulated, but their hearts were right.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:50.062]  They're heroes, the Bundys and others, even though they were silly and fell on their face.
[00:40:50.403 --> 00:40:51.683]  They are real men.
[00:40:51.723 --> 00:40:52.944]  The guy you killed is a real man.
[00:40:53.244 --> 00:40:58.227]  The people out there playing along with this globalist takeover, you know what you're doing.
[00:41:01.138 --> 00:41:02.919]  I wouldn't want to be you when you face Christ.
[00:41:03.359 --> 00:41:04.959]  Backdoor gun control.
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:11.662]  Doctors, not psychologists, to screen all adults for depression with a ten question survey.
[00:41:12.002 --> 00:41:14.423]  You answer three of those, wrong.
[00:41:15.063 --> 00:41:17.704]  I'm sad sometimes, I'm anxious sometimes, I'm depressed.
[00:41:17.984 --> 00:41:19.105]  Your guns are gone.
[00:41:19.525 --> 00:41:21.205]  KitDanielsInfoWars.com.
[00:41:21.646 --> 00:41:24.967]  That's the new executive order that they just have the medical tyranny.
[00:41:26.204 --> 00:41:26.484]  U.S.
[00:41:26.504 --> 00:41:27.565]  destabilizing Europe.
[00:41:28.106 --> 00:41:31.909]  Austrian record-holding athlete lashes out at idiotic refugee policies.
[00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.710]  It's not idiotic.
[00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:33.830]  They're bringing in martial law with it.
[00:41:35.152 --> 00:41:36.673]  See, people keep saying they're idiotic.
[00:41:36.713 --> 00:41:37.534]  No, they run things.
[00:41:37.574 --> 00:41:38.855]  The globalists are totally evil.
[00:41:39.335 --> 00:41:41.137]  You've got to admit that they're scientific.
[00:41:41.337 --> 00:41:42.498]  They've dominated us.
[00:41:42.718 --> 00:41:43.779]  They're on top of us.
[00:41:43.859 --> 00:41:44.880]  Not, oh, they're crazy.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.541]  Because it makes you feel better about it.
[00:41:47.222 --> 00:41:49.103]  That's the first step, going, this is crazy.
[00:41:49.584 --> 00:41:50.845]  Yeah, crazy like a fox.
[00:41:52.366 --> 00:41:56.391]  You gotta get inside the enemy's mind or they're gonna beat you every time.
[00:41:56.411 --> 00:41:59.875]  60% of refugees heading to Europe are economic migrants, top EU official.
[00:42:01.096 --> 00:42:03.039]  Yeah, they want free goodies and, you know, women.
[00:42:04.002 --> 00:42:07.184]  I mean, in their countries, women are just absolute property, so why not?
[00:42:07.745 --> 00:42:12.729]  By the way, they've got the liberal German women out giving the Arab men roses and just saying, hey baby, I'm here.
[00:42:13.149 --> 00:42:14.490]  I'm sorry for our misogyny.
[00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:28.120]  I'm sorry for our xenophobia against your horrible Stone Age, you know, religion of making women wear beaky pursuits and sexually mutilating and killing a woman if a man rapes her.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:32.964]  And so, of course, the sickening anti-female, anti-family devil
[00:42:33.644 --> 00:42:42.148]  Feminists love it because they hate women, they want you to abort your children, they want you without a good man, they want you to hate your sons if you do have them.
[00:42:42.569 --> 00:42:45.010]  They're just eugenicists high priestesses.
[00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:59.197]  So of course they go to the islamicist, you know, caliphate slavers and just hit their knees because they love cancer, they love death, they love failure, they hate the West!
[00:43:00.779 --> 00:43:02.140]  They hate the new Atlantis!
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.600]  They want to blow it up!
[00:43:05.201 --> 00:43:07.341]  Absolutely overrun by demons, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:07.782 --> 00:43:12.924]  As ISIS threat grows in Europe, NATO to deliver five Global Hawks to Sicily by the end of 2016.
[00:43:12.964 --> 00:43:18.466]  That'll be to bomb opposition to Al-Qaeda in Libya.
[00:43:19.466 --> 00:43:24.968]  But they sell that to the public like, oh, they're going to battle ISIS in Italy with drones!
[00:43:25.268 --> 00:43:26.929]  It's the government bringing them in!
[00:43:29.423 --> 00:43:30.184]  It goes on and on.
[00:43:30.284 --> 00:43:32.107]  I haven't even hit one-tenth of the articles.
[00:43:32.447 --> 00:43:35.050]  Rome covers up nude statues in Muslim for Iran president.
[00:43:35.211 --> 00:43:36.192]  See, all about censorship.
[00:43:36.452 --> 00:43:38.675]  We censor ourselves for them.
[00:43:38.955 --> 00:43:41.318]  God forbid he sees a statue of David.
[00:43:42.099 --> 00:43:45.324]  Feminized males will allow Muslims to conquer Europe.
[00:43:45.344 --> 00:43:46.105]  Another key article.
[00:43:50.587 --> 00:43:52.308]  Totally key article I mentioned earlier.
[00:43:52.368 --> 00:43:53.529]  We need to get that out to everybody.
[00:43:54.650 --> 00:44:03.855]  Now Obama is having Bernie Sanders to the White House signaling that they may just not use Biden, they may use Sanders.
[00:44:05.176 --> 00:44:07.797]  They may be offering him a VP slot with Biden.
[00:44:09.358 --> 00:44:09.819]  Wait for it.
[00:44:11.059 --> 00:44:11.420]  Wait for it.
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.100]  That's in the cards.
[00:44:13.581 --> 00:44:15.422]  Or Elizabeth Warren and Biden.
[00:44:16.202 --> 00:44:16.723]  Joe Biden!
[00:44:18.117 --> 00:44:24.963]  Clintonista complains to Twitter, the co-founder, that Hillary, mocking hashtag, is pure misogyny.
[00:44:24.983 --> 00:44:26.765]  She's criticizing the Lord and Savior.
[00:44:26.785 --> 00:44:27.626]  She's hating women.
[00:44:27.646 --> 00:44:28.607]  She's not criticizing Obama.
[00:44:28.627 --> 00:44:29.808]  She's criticizing blacks.
[00:44:30.008 --> 00:44:31.750]  We'll have to sit here and explain to women if she gets elected.
[00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:34.952]  We're not against you.
[00:44:35.213 --> 00:44:35.993]  We're not against you.
[00:44:36.234 --> 00:44:36.814]  We're not against you.
[00:44:36.834 --> 00:44:38.235]  The CIA ran Hillary and Ms.
[00:44:38.256 --> 00:44:38.616]  Magazine.
[00:44:38.876 --> 00:44:40.638]  We just, we just want to stop her.
[00:44:40.918 --> 00:44:41.699]  She's a tyrant.
[00:44:41.839 --> 00:44:42.259]  Shut up!
[00:44:42.419 --> 00:44:43.180]  The women are winning!
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:43.921]  You'll never stop us!
[00:44:45.299 --> 00:44:47.039]  It's like Charlton Heston at the end of Omega Man.
[00:44:47.099 --> 00:44:47.820]  I have the cure!
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.040]  I want to free you!
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:49.700]  Shut up!
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:50.860]  They throw a spear into him.
[00:44:51.341 --> 00:44:51.901]  Shut up!
[00:44:51.961 --> 00:44:53.101]  We want to be like this!
[00:44:54.021 --> 00:44:55.082]  There's chemicals in the water!
[00:44:55.222 --> 00:44:55.862]  We want them!
[00:44:55.882 --> 00:45:00.463]  Alright, we're going to Biggs here in a minute.
[00:45:02.704 --> 00:45:04.324]  It's going on and on and on.
[00:45:04.384 --> 00:45:07.405]  I mean, it just gets crazier and crazier and crazier.
[00:45:13.598 --> 00:45:14.559]  Oh, look at this headline.
[00:45:14.619 --> 00:45:22.364]  High-profile militant John Ritzheim flees home to Arizona hours before the Feds spring it.
[00:45:22.504 --> 00:45:22.864]  The trap.
[00:45:22.964 --> 00:45:23.644]  Oh, isn't that convenient?
[00:45:23.664 --> 00:45:29.108]  We're going to be getting into that in just a moment with the Oregon standoff having a bloody turn.
[00:45:29.928 --> 00:45:33.991]  And the mainstream media, I have TV and I have the Daily Mail, saying there was a shootout.
[00:45:34.051 --> 00:45:34.591]  No, there wasn't.
[00:45:34.631 --> 00:45:35.492]  The Feds even admit that.
[00:45:35.852 --> 00:45:40.275]  So I guess when the Feds pull me over and shoot me, they'll just say it was a shootout.
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:43.800]  Very, very dangerous.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:44.480]  That's all coming up.
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.041]  China warns Soros against declaring war on its currency.
[00:45:47.061 --> 00:45:51.222]  20,000 chunks of space debris are floating around Earth.
[00:45:52.442 --> 00:45:53.622]  More on the Zika virus.
[00:45:53.642 --> 00:45:55.163]  There's just hundreds of key articles.
[00:45:55.703 --> 00:46:05.425]  But first, ladies and gentlemen, I want to tell everybody that we are running the biggest special we ever have on DNA Force.
[00:46:06.867 --> 00:46:09.111]  This is our Rolls-Royce product.
[00:46:09.731 --> 00:46:11.334]  Comparable formulas are $300 to $600.
[00:46:13.457 --> 00:46:17.042]  Just the Bio-PQQ in it cost about $40 for us.
[00:46:17.082 --> 00:46:22.730]  That's why a comparable just a dose of Bio-PQQ is $40 with other leading brands that aren't even organic like ours.
[00:46:24.108 --> 00:46:32.134]  And it has a whole bunch of other key ingredients that are very expensive as well, but we just give you the very lowest price on it, and this has turned a lot of heads the two years it's been out.
[00:46:32.395 --> 00:46:38.820]  We can actually say about this 125 clinical studies, nerve, growth factor, energize, and more.
[00:46:40.341 --> 00:46:41.722]  I forget how many pounds it is.
[00:46:41.782 --> 00:46:43.183]  It's something like 300 pounds of blueberries.
[00:46:43.203 --> 00:46:44.424]  300 pounds of blueberries.
[00:46:49.858 --> 00:46:53.503]  To get the same amount of vitamin C that's in Bio PQQ.
[00:46:53.563 --> 00:46:58.689]  It's basically super vitamin C. Like Linus Pauling won the Nobel Prize for what it could do.
[00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:00.972]  But if you take that much vitamin C, you get sick.
[00:47:02.654 --> 00:47:03.576]  You get diarrhea.
[00:47:05.075 --> 00:47:06.556]  But not with BioPQQ.
[00:47:07.476 --> 00:47:15.281]  Now we're paying $14,000 a kilo from Mishabishi America that owns the patent for this, and they can't believe we're even buying it.
[00:47:15.821 --> 00:47:20.343]  They only basically sell it in Japan in places they make it here, because no one will even pay for it.
[00:47:21.304 --> 00:47:23.805]  Or they'd pay $600 a bottle for the real deal.
[00:47:24.605 --> 00:47:28.007]  I mean, to give you an idea, that's why it's, ladies and gentlemen, normally $150.
[00:47:30.913 --> 00:47:33.655]  Because this stuff's like $80 a product going into the bottle.
[00:47:34.335 --> 00:47:35.676]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is $97.
[00:47:35.716 --> 00:47:38.178]  It doesn't say on my sheet, I know it's 25% off.
[00:47:38.258 --> 00:47:38.518]  You got $97.50.
[00:47:43.223 --> 00:47:48.366]  Normally $134 discounted.
[00:47:48.386 --> 00:47:48.366]  $97.50.
[00:47:49.527 --> 00:47:52.669]  So you can see it's almost a loss leader, folks.
[00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:58.113]  When you've got, depending on which batch we do and how much it costs, between $70 and $80 of product.
[00:47:58.413 --> 00:48:08.380]  The Bio PQQ cost us something like, depending on how much we pay at the time, $35 to $40 for one ingredient and it's got all the other super ingredients in it.
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:11.222]  It is, we believe from our research, the ultimate
[00:48:14.025 --> 00:48:15.466]  Pill for you name it.
[00:48:15.486 --> 00:48:18.307]  I mean, my finger was cut off, hanging by skin.
[00:48:18.687 --> 00:48:20.388]  It was still numb a decade later.
[00:48:20.608 --> 00:48:28.191]  When this came out two and a half years ago, I began taking it and my whole side of my finger started tingling a month in and the feeling came back.
[00:48:29.152 --> 00:48:30.972]  And that's exactly what they say it does.
[00:48:31.072 --> 00:48:34.954]  It's one of the only documented things with nerve regeneration.
[00:48:35.054 --> 00:48:36.875]  It is incredible.
[00:48:38.107 --> 00:48:40.089]  And everybody's asking me, why don't you ever talk about this?
[00:48:40.129 --> 00:48:44.854]  Well, it costs a lot and I just want to plug, you know, the little silver that's, you know, $19.
[00:48:44.914 --> 00:48:46.937]  I just, you know, no, no, this is the super product.
[00:48:47.257 --> 00:48:49.820]  This is what people should check out for themselves.
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.804]  And the discount only goes for a few days because here's the deal.
[00:48:55.299 --> 00:49:01.025]  The discount only goes for a few days because we only have a limited supply and we'll get more in in five weeks.
[00:49:01.045 --> 00:49:03.448]  So I decided to do this as a loss leader and to sell it out.
[00:49:03.768 --> 00:49:05.030]  It'll probably be gone by next week.
[00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:09.855]  Infowarslife.com and the purchase funds this key operation.
[00:49:10.035 --> 00:49:13.899]  There's some other new specials today at infowarslife.com and infowarsstore.com.
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.882]  Free shipping on all orders above $50 as well.
[00:49:17.362 --> 00:49:20.905]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:49:21.105 --> 00:49:24.007]  All right, this is the last break of the week.
[00:49:24.047 --> 00:49:25.288]  I'm skipping, but I'm skipping this one.
[00:49:25.708 --> 00:49:31.172]  Let's bring Joe Biggs in, former Army Staff Sergeant Combat Vet of Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:49:33.074 --> 00:49:40.619]  Combat vet, he can comment on the tactics, you know, the so-called military people that were there, most of which were never in the military, what he saw,
[00:49:41.873 --> 00:49:48.455]  The fact that they pulled the car over, and then reportedly they ran, it crashed, according to the daughter that was in the car and others.
[00:49:49.135 --> 00:49:54.836]  And then they'd already shot up the vehicle, the woman jumps out, the man jumps out, and they shoot Mr. Lavoie.
[00:49:55.476 --> 00:50:00.097]  I think the man had a lot of courage, I think he meant well, and he was ready to die.
[00:50:00.117 --> 00:50:02.998]  And we're going to go over his quotes to newspapers just last week.
[00:50:03.978 --> 00:50:06.420]  That said, I don't think it's time for a shooting war.
[00:50:06.881 --> 00:50:08.962]  People don't even understand the factions that are involved.
[00:50:09.303 --> 00:50:19.851]  The globalists want to start a shooting war, but Joe Biggs was there for a week last month in the middle of this circus, or I guess actually earlier this month, in the middle of this circus.
[00:50:20.552 --> 00:50:25.556]  And now they still reportedly, tell me if it changed last hour, have the wildlife refuge surrounded.
[00:50:25.596 --> 00:50:27.298]  The feds now are going Waco style.
[00:50:28.198 --> 00:50:30.580]  I'm not saying any of the people that got arrested are feds.
[00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:48.792]  And I'm also not saying that there's a sun in the sky at high noon.
[00:50:48.952 --> 00:50:50.733]  But they did this with Atari.
[00:50:50.773 --> 00:51:01.998]  I said, watch who they release in a few weeks and who the charges quietly get dropped on because that's what they do to protect informants and operatives if there were any in the group that are in there.
[00:51:02.619 --> 00:51:03.719]  And I'm just putting that out there.
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:06.161]  That needs to be watched very, very closely.
[00:51:06.201 --> 00:51:07.801]  We're watching it very closely.
[00:51:09.122 --> 00:51:12.424]  And you can look at the mug shots and see who looks concerned and who doesn't.
[00:51:13.264 --> 00:51:40.644]  uh... but uh... this is uh... this is a very very serious information obviously we're going to be unfolding the feds need to release the video right now we have one of the daughters of the people who was in the car reader quote saying that uh... again they pulled him over they should let the women go ralph will go with you they said no they drove off the feds reportedly shot at them they crashed the vehicle the guy uh... gets out uh... lavoie and say
[00:51:42.887 --> 00:51:43.287]  I think so.
[00:52:01.653 --> 00:52:04.574]  But, we need to choose our battles, like they said at Bunker Hill.
[00:52:05.374 --> 00:52:14.336]  And I'm sorry, I don't think in the smarts departments, and I'm not saying they're stupid, but these guys haven't been in this 20 plus years like I and others have been in it.
[00:52:15.236 --> 00:52:22.457]  They don't have the growth curve, they don't have the knowledge curve, and they're not the leaders, you know, for 1776 Part II.
[00:52:22.517 --> 00:52:24.338]  I mean, they're just not George Washington.
[00:52:24.778 --> 00:52:26.478]  I don't even consider myself George Washington.
[00:52:26.718 --> 00:52:30.959]  And I'm one of the most focused, out front, informed people in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:52:31.912 --> 00:52:36.474]  Uh, but we supported them out there with what happened in Nevada.
[00:52:36.495 --> 00:52:37.175]  They were on the right.
[00:52:37.215 --> 00:52:38.195]  It was a magic moment.
[00:52:38.716 --> 00:52:40.757]  But now it's turned south and it's very sad.
[00:52:41.017 --> 00:52:44.399]  Joe, your overall view of this crisis and then let's get into the numbers and the facts here.
[00:52:44.999 --> 00:52:47.620]  You know, when we got there, uh, I was reading news reports.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:50.222]  Everyone's saying that, you know, the people in Burns didn't want
[00:52:51.202 --> 00:52:51.743]  The Bundy's there.
[00:52:51.763 --> 00:52:52.943]  They didn't want the militiamen there.
[00:52:53.304 --> 00:52:57.746]  You know, and after getting boots on the ground and actually being able to talk to some of the locals, that just wasn't the case.
[00:52:58.387 --> 00:53:15.717]  So right off the bat, you can kind of tell that they were ready to demonize this, use this as a, maybe to set an example for what the government wanted to do to people like this, to so-called right-wingers, who were going to go up and make a stand against the government because they did get beat back in Nevada when that happened with the standoff on the Bundy Ranch.
[00:53:15.737 --> 00:53:17.718]  And we can roll some of that B-roll in the background.
[00:53:17.798 --> 00:53:18.278]  It's historic.
[00:53:19.719 --> 00:53:23.443]  Feds surrender, armed feds surrender to citizens.
[00:53:23.744 --> 00:53:26.787]  They were threatening to shoot David Knight at the front of it with a camera.
[00:53:27.308 --> 00:53:27.988]  They were in the wrong.
[00:53:28.048 --> 00:53:29.670]  That would have been Lexington or Concord.
[00:53:30.231 --> 00:53:31.372]  Shot heard around the world.
[00:53:31.532 --> 00:53:40.042]  If they would have mowed down people with their guns, not up, but guns down, on horseback with American flags, that would have kicked off a revolution and we might win that one.
[00:53:40.382 --> 00:53:49.652]  But if a revolution kicks off in the wrong way and we shoot first, that gives the enemy home field advantage and the toying costs to be receiving the kickoff.
[00:53:49.672 --> 00:53:49.992]  Go ahead.
[00:53:50.333 --> 00:53:58.281]  Well, you can tell that they were upset over this is the fact that they did have to back down that this was a worldwide event that was seen by people all over.
[00:53:59.218 --> 00:54:09.585]  And the federal government had to step back, they had to move back, and the Bundy stood up and all these people came out, they supported, they showed up, and it was this huge embarrassment on the federal government.
[00:54:10.006 --> 00:54:11.647]  And then you see what happened here in Oregon.
[00:54:11.767 --> 00:54:13.508]  They took this as an opportunity, I think.
[00:54:13.869 --> 00:54:25.977]  That's why they brought in the amount of FBI they did, why they brought in more police officers from different counties surrounding that area, in hopes that they would be able to eventually go in, take these guys and make an example of them.
[00:54:26.337 --> 00:54:27.178]  And it's just kind of been a...
[00:54:28.519 --> 00:54:29.499]  I don't know, a countdown.
[00:54:29.959 --> 00:54:32.700]  You know, there were many nights we thought it was going to happen while I was there.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:33.920]  I was only there three or four days.
[00:54:34.561 --> 00:54:38.862]  And, you know, night after night, you would see these guys bringing up the tractors, the trucks.
[00:54:39.282 --> 00:54:43.263]  They were worried that there was going to be this imminent FBI raid that was going to happen.
[00:54:43.903 --> 00:54:46.343]  And they stayed inside that compound.
[00:54:46.383 --> 00:54:49.364]  But since then, they've began to venture out more and more.
[00:54:49.964 --> 00:54:52.065]  And that's what... Guaranteed they got advised that...
[00:54:52.892 --> 00:54:56.273]  Because they'll watch this later with their lawyers and stuff and maybe start listening to me.
[00:54:56.833 --> 00:54:59.014]  Like Rand Paul finally started listening a few weeks ago.
[00:54:59.074 --> 00:55:00.674]  And I'm not bragging, we just know what we're talking about.
[00:55:00.694 --> 00:55:04.135]  The folks that I'm sure advise you it's safe that you come out.
[00:55:04.175 --> 00:55:05.455]  Of course, that's not when it was safe.
[00:55:06.635 --> 00:55:13.117]  And again, if people aren't provocateurs that are in sumo wrestler outfits and people, you know, doing all this, then they ought to be.
[00:55:13.397 --> 00:55:16.318]  Because that's exactly what I would do if I was on the other side of this.
[00:55:17.199 --> 00:55:24.061]  You know, I had a chance to actually, you know, talk with Lavoie Finnegan, and he is definitely one of those guys who's extremely passionate.
[00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:29.002]  He believed in what was going on, and he said before, when we were there, he actually walked out.
[00:55:29.382 --> 00:55:38.945]  There was word that there was a warrant out for his arrest, so he walked out to the end of the Wildlife Refuge, sat asleep and bagged down, had his little rifle, and said, hey, I'm staying here.
[00:55:38.985 --> 00:55:40.765]  If they want to come arrest me, come to me.
[00:55:41.165 --> 00:55:42.286]  He was making a stand.
[00:55:42.326 --> 00:55:43.426]  We can only admire it.
[00:55:43.906 --> 00:55:47.087]  And, you know, isn't it interesting that he's the one that got shot and killed?
[00:55:47.367 --> 00:55:47.967]  Yeah.
[00:55:48.027 --> 00:55:50.648]  Because, I mean, I guess he was ready for it.
[00:55:50.808 --> 00:55:56.690]  And I guess, you know, he wrote a book about, you know, martial law basically starting after some patriots get killed.
[00:55:56.710 --> 00:56:00.331]  In fact, I'm going to pull up some of the quotes from the book he wrote.
[00:56:00.631 --> 00:56:02.832]  I mean, I guess he kind of fell in love with the idea of that.
[00:56:03.232 --> 00:56:07.473]  So, is that the martyr everybody needs or wants when the guy wanted to be a martyr?
[00:56:07.493 --> 00:56:08.973]  Again, I'm not saying he's a bad guy.
[00:56:09.013 --> 00:56:11.074]  I'm just saying, you know, this really doesn't make sense.
[00:56:12.557 --> 00:56:23.848]  Yeah, I mean, it's interesting how this whole thing unfolded, because you have a Victoria Sharpe, one of the ladies who was in the vehicle last night, saying that he in fact got out, he had his hands up, that they shot at him first, and that's what happened.
[00:56:23.868 --> 00:56:25.829]  You know, you have that whole hands up, don't shoot thing.
[00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:29.213]  And now you have other eyewitnesses, two drivers, two guys.
[00:56:29.773 --> 00:56:33.014]  Separate vehicles talking about how, in fact, that wasn't the case.
[00:56:33.054 --> 00:56:42.136]  The guy who was a bodyguard, his name's McConnell, this is in an article by Raw Story titled, Eyewitnesses Knockdown Conspiracy Theories About Lavoie Finnegan Dying With His Hands Up.
[00:56:42.456 --> 00:56:48.218]  Now this guy took to Facebook late last night, early this morning, now everyone look at it, and came out and said that he saw
[00:56:49.398 --> 00:56:51.982]  From his point of view, that they were pulled over, they were stopped.
[00:56:52.423 --> 00:56:59.172]  LaVoy Finnegan's truck went around, they sped around that stop and went into some kind of like snow embankment.
[00:56:59.753 --> 00:57:03.238]  And at that point in time, based off his testimony,
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:13.063]  Well, that's what the daughter, I've got her name right here, who's saying it's horrible they killed him, you know, she's saying they're bad, she's with them, and, you know, a daughter of one of the men in the truck,
[00:57:28.351 --> 00:57:32.012]  She's saying, you know, they shot him in the head as he ran towards them saying, shoot me.
[00:57:32.772 --> 00:57:38.814]  So that's what the eyewitnesses who are on the side of the Bundys and everybody are saying.
[00:57:38.854 --> 00:57:39.975]  I'm not defending what happened.
[00:57:39.995 --> 00:57:43.756]  I don't think it's good they shot a guy running at him who was unarmed.
[00:57:43.776 --> 00:57:46.277]  But I mean, can we roll the footage from the original Bundy deal?
[00:57:46.317 --> 00:57:47.377]  Because I've been wanting that.
[00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:48.318]  I know we have it in there.
[00:57:48.758 --> 00:57:49.998]  You know, just some of that in the background.
[00:57:50.038 --> 00:57:52.079]  But here's some footage.
[00:57:52.179 --> 00:57:53.659]  Are the feds already releasing footage?
[00:57:53.959 --> 00:57:55.400]  Nico, tell us what this is that we're seeing.
[00:57:58.421 --> 00:57:59.382]  Again, for radio listeners.
[00:57:59.402 --> 00:58:04.384]  This is B-roll that Travis sent us this morning from Oregon, which features LaVoy Finnegan.
[00:58:05.965 --> 00:58:07.105]  Oh, this is earlier footage.
[00:58:07.125 --> 00:58:07.565]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:58:07.585 --> 00:58:07.966]  I saw it.
[00:58:07.986 --> 00:58:08.686]  That's where he's talking stuff.
[00:58:08.706 --> 00:58:09.566]  Yeah, he sent this to me this morning.
[00:58:09.586 --> 00:58:10.527]  Yes, at another checkpoint.
[00:58:10.587 --> 00:58:11.607]  Okay, yeah, there's a lot of this.
[00:58:11.927 --> 00:58:13.488]  So, again, if you're a radio listener, just tune in.
[00:58:13.508 --> 00:58:16.630]  We're also tvinfowars.com forward slash show.
[00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:17.630]  We don't know what happened.
[00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:19.651]  You know, I don't know if he did have his hands up.
[00:58:19.691 --> 00:58:20.571]  I'm not saying that he didn't.
[00:58:20.952 --> 00:58:23.893]  And I'm not saying that these guys are, you know, lying or not.
[00:58:24.073 --> 00:58:29.837]  Well, some people are putting the story out that he was on his knees, but that's folks on Facebook that aren't there.
[00:58:30.698 --> 00:58:38.483]  But the woman who was there, the daughter, I got her name, we'll come back and go over it, said, oh, it's terrible, they killed him, they murdered him, you know, they're from that perspective.
[00:58:39.283 --> 00:58:41.965]  But he got out and ran at them, yelling at them.
[00:58:43.506 --> 00:58:45.207]  It's a very, very tense situation, folks.
[00:58:45.228 --> 00:58:46.208]  This is very, very sad.
[00:58:46.248 --> 00:58:49.551]  We don't want to start a civil war over this and give Obama a big, giant present.
[00:58:49.811 --> 00:58:50.211]  Biggs, stay there.
[00:58:50.231 --> 00:58:53.494]  We're going to come right back to you and look at more of this.
[00:58:53.514 --> 00:58:54.975]  This has got me really wound up, though.
[00:58:55.295 --> 00:58:56.816]  Plus all this World War III news.
[00:58:56.896 --> 00:58:57.737]  I mean, just look at all this.
[00:58:58.792 --> 00:59:00.153]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:59:00.433 --> 00:59:01.713]  You can't survive without it.
[00:59:01.914 --> 00:59:02.814]  But where do you get it?
[00:59:03.134 --> 00:59:08.877]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:59:09.117 --> 00:59:14.820]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:31.888]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:34.410]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:35.951]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:59:36.231 --> 00:59:37.012]  Easy assembly.
[00:59:37.272 --> 00:59:37.893]  Low maintenance.
[00:59:38.193 --> 00:59:40.015]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[01:00:01.303 --> 01:00:17.638]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:17.758 --> 01:00:21.661]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:22.502 --> 01:00:27.587]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.462 --> 01:00:31.103]  Careful what you wish, you just might get it.
[01:00:32.043 --> 01:00:37.484]  This LaVoy gentleman wrote a novel, we're going to go over it in a moment, saying that we needed a bloody revolution in America.
[01:00:37.984 --> 01:00:45.626]  He told the newspaper last week, got it up on Infowars.com, that he thought it was going to come down to violence, that he was going to stand his ground.
[01:00:46.246 --> 01:00:49.247]  The feds are out of control, they're run by foreign banks, they are robbing people.
[01:00:50.299 --> 01:00:52.381]  But the public doesn't fully understand that yet.
[01:00:52.421 --> 01:00:53.102]  They're starting to.
[01:00:53.122 --> 01:00:56.245]  In fact, the new national poll, the public sees the government as the number one enemy.
[01:00:56.806 --> 01:00:58.387]  Well, the people that run the government, they are the enemy.
[01:00:59.068 --> 01:01:06.896]  But they want to get us fighting with the low-level government, which will descend into civil war, like they do in the Middle East and Europe, Eastern Europe.
[01:01:06.916 --> 01:01:08.237]  We don't need to be stupid about this.
[01:01:08.738 --> 01:01:13.303]  It will not defeat the globalists if a bunch of FBI SWAT team guys get shot in the back.
[01:01:14.611 --> 01:01:14.891]  Okay.
[01:01:15.392 --> 01:01:21.157]  I mean, if it goes into civil war and they start coming after folks like Alexander Shultz and Eatson said, you know, then you got to meet them.
[01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:22.858]  Then it goes to that.
[01:01:23.972 --> 01:01:31.358]  But I'm the public and the Fed's best friend because I'm trying to stop this whole Civil War George Soros is trying to kick off.
[01:01:31.978 --> 01:01:33.699]  Joe Biggs, you were there.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.501]  You knew Lavoie, the man that's been killed.
[01:01:36.281 --> 01:01:38.983]  What do you make of the folks now being locked up?
[01:01:39.003 --> 01:01:39.844]  What is it, seven of them?
[01:01:40.665 --> 01:01:44.287]  Very, very sad and just really...
[01:01:46.141 --> 01:01:54.487]  To see the left getting off on this and rubbing their hands together and saying, good, kill the white terrorists, that's what they've been calling them, calling for their deaths, is just sickening.
[01:01:54.687 --> 01:01:56.709]  Yeah, I mean, so let's look at it this way.
[01:01:57.229 --> 01:02:11.419]  What happened in Nevada, they were on their land, it was at the right time, the right place, they had a great backing, it was wanted, and it was a perfect timing for that scenario to unfold, when it did, where it did, how it did, with the people there.
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:13.521]  When Oregon happened,
[01:02:14.181 --> 01:02:17.122]  You know, there was a lot of people out there that said, hey, man, we support the bunnies.
[01:02:17.622 --> 01:02:20.583]  We're just kind of confused about why here, what's going on.
[01:02:20.964 --> 01:02:25.645]  You know, the fact that the Hammonds have come out and simply said, hey, we're going to turn ourselves in.
[01:02:25.805 --> 01:02:28.687]  Some of the people that were hanging around and doing stuff.
[01:02:29.487 --> 01:02:32.648]  Like I said, I've been a big supporter.
[01:02:32.668 --> 01:02:33.668]  I've even spoke to
[01:02:35.743 --> 01:02:36.184]  I don't know.
[01:02:54.542 --> 01:02:58.343]  You know, but then you have that left again coming out, which I don't get, saying white terror.
[01:02:58.763 --> 01:03:05.746]  You know, you have all these people on Twitter coming out last night saying, oh great, you know, these terrorists, these white terrorists are arrested, call them terrorists, that's what they should be.
[01:03:06.186 --> 01:03:10.047]  Well, sorry, you know, and they're all the Black Lives Matter people.
[01:03:10.387 --> 01:03:16.269]  Well, I mean, they want a race war, and they paint everything as racial, and they also sit there and...
[01:03:18.508 --> 01:03:25.538]  I mean, really, at the end of the day, what happened?
[01:03:25.618 --> 01:03:29.223]  Martha and Tom didn't get to go into the wildlife refuge and work a few days a week.
[01:03:29.784 --> 01:03:32.708]  I mean, there's probably hardly anybody out there really manning that place.
[01:03:33.028 --> 01:03:34.070]  It's in the middle of nowhere.
[01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.911]  Meanwhile,
[01:03:35.932 --> 01:03:40.055]  They quote-unquote break into this federal facility, and what do I see them doing when I'm down there?
[01:03:40.415 --> 01:03:45.699]  Sweeping, cleaning off the sidewalks, taking care of the property, the land, making sure it's fine.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:52.645]  I didn't see anyone in Black Lives Matter and Ferguson break into a store and start doing shopkeep work and rearranging stuff.
[01:03:52.665 --> 01:03:57.128]  No, they were taking stuff and running out and throwing Molotov cocktails and lighting buildings on fire.
[01:03:57.148 --> 01:03:59.970]  Well, also, look at the Daily Mail headline, and I saw this on the local news there.
[01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:03.153]  It says, Oregon standoff, militiamen killed in shootout with FBI.
[01:04:04.113 --> 01:04:04.714]  This was written
[01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:11.014]  Today, after the Feds had already said that they didn't shoot at him.
[01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:13.697]  That Lavoie didn't shoot at him.
[01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:15.998]  Wow, Daily Mail.
[01:04:16.078 --> 01:04:18.800]  I usually like the Daily Mail, but man, that is a load of bull.
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:21.362]  Correct your story right now.
[01:04:21.722 --> 01:04:22.683]  Well, they've been just sitting there.
[01:04:22.703 --> 01:04:28.087]  As soon as the headlines came out last night that there was a possible situation unfolding in Oregon, I could just see those people.
[01:04:28.107 --> 01:04:43.840]  I was sitting there on my phone, and I was just waiting on those headlines to come out on Twitter, on CNN, on everything like that, saying, hey, you know, there's been this massive shootout, and that the Bundys, and there was this huge standoff, and they gunned down, and they shot at the feds, and this and that, and it's just not the case.
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:48.524]  The left was waiting on that, just like the FBI was waiting to use this as a situation.
[01:04:48.544 --> 01:04:54.108]  The left wants to use martial law in America, and I want to come back, finish up with the bunnies.
[01:04:54.128 --> 01:05:04.077]  We've got to move into other areas, but will Trump be in the debate tomorrow night that we'll be covering with Mystery Science, the Political Science Theater 3000, and more.
[01:05:04.137 --> 01:05:05.218]  It's all coming up.

[01:05:33.684 --> 01:05:41.289]  When we see the 8-year-old boy scout who can't fly a plane because he has the same name as some suspected terrorist, when he turns 16, he's not going to be able to get a driver's license.
[01:05:41.309 --> 01:05:42.490]  He's not going to be able to get a job.
[01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:43.851]  He's not going to be able to get a college loan.

[01:08:01.868 --> 01:08:07.894]  I'm Alex Jones for Super Mel Vitality and InfoWarsLife.com and I salute you, our supporters!
[01:08:11.664 --> 01:08:17.668]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:21.331]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:22.912 --> 01:08:24.453]  Huge, huge news.
[01:08:24.513 --> 01:08:26.574]  The story is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:29.788 --> 01:08:32.870]  Bernie Sanders has been invited to the White House to meet with Obama.
[01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:39.093]  That is a clear signal proving the major riff we reported on years ago that we now know is really getting by.
[01:08:39.113 --> 01:08:44.976]  That Biden may come in with Elizabeth Warren, the senator, if Hillary gets indicted, or it might be a Bernie Sanders.
[01:08:46.277 --> 01:08:46.837]  Bloomberg.
[01:08:47.337 --> 01:08:50.419]  Bloomberg, or it could also be Joe Biden.
[01:08:51.339 --> 01:08:53.821]  This shows that Hillary could really be indicted any minute.
[01:08:54.670 --> 01:09:09.674]  Former Republican whip, political persecuted person Tom DeLay has gone public and he wouldn't make that up and said the word is the FBI at high level is going to go public about what Hillary's done if the Justice Department doesn't indict.
[01:09:10.374 --> 01:09:15.536]  But this Justice Department run by Lynch is out there saying he can just take guns outside of law.
[01:09:15.876 --> 01:09:21.017]  He can just have doctors, not psychiatrists, but just your doctor say you look depressed and have your guns taken.
[01:09:21.397 --> 01:09:22.998]  It's all extrajudicial
[01:09:24.561 --> 01:09:25.622]  Extra legislative.
[01:09:26.202 --> 01:09:33.585]  We've got huge amounts of news on top experts saying we've never been in a more dangerous position.
[01:09:33.625 --> 01:09:36.847]  Doomsday Clock, world more dangerous than during Cold War.
[01:09:36.867 --> 01:09:40.769]  But I want to finish up with Joe Biggs because I think that you and David Knight probably
[01:09:42.657 --> 01:09:49.007]  David did a really great job whenever he went and covered the first whole Bundy situation, so he should be part of this as well.
[01:09:49.347 --> 01:09:56.318]  And Josh, he's been going out on the road a lot, so I don't make our camera people go out every week, but Josh or whoever you guys want to take, I think you should leave today.
[01:09:57.678 --> 01:10:14.588]  uh... or tomorrow morning and get out to Oregon and hit the ground running and and and and not just be reporters but leaders out there to really inform and show what's happening and identify provocateurs and really have a mission of trying to stop a civil war slash race war.
[01:10:14.608 --> 01:10:21.312]  That's why I went and met with Farrakhan right when this whole Oregon thing was kicking off earlier in the month and and he concurred and agreed with me on that front.
[01:10:21.332 --> 01:10:24.554]  We really need to work for not having
[01:10:25.114 --> 01:10:25.254]  I think?
[01:10:55.759 --> 01:10:55.939]  I don't
[01:11:16.408 --> 01:11:28.719]  I respect people that say they're in the militia, but then I don't have to be under their command and agree with everything that they say or everything they do, or that this not being the best place, because a lot of locals don't want you.
[01:11:29.199 --> 01:11:31.882]  And you know, this isn't your own grazing rights, and things like that.
[01:11:32.562 --> 01:11:36.446]  But the man that was killed did say that he
[01:11:39.946 --> 01:11:47.008]  Mr. LaVoy wrote a novel, and I'll go over it in a minute, saying that we need a bloody revolution in this country, and he told the newspaper last week he was ready for that.
[01:11:47.888 --> 01:12:04.854]  So, it's very sad that according to witnesses that were in the car, and I'll go to that, I'm going to dig that out of the article here in a moment, we'll put it on screen, it's in Paul Watson's article, eyewitness, Oregon militiamen murdered by cops, he had his hands in the air, daughter, he was shot in the face.
[01:12:05.794 --> 01:12:05.894]  Yeah.
[01:12:36.448 --> 01:12:40.353]  I mean, from meeting the guy, you know, he, like I said, he was someone who was very passionate.
[01:12:40.433 --> 01:12:45.799]  I don't see him as being someone who's just going to lay down and kind of, you know, just take something like that.
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:51.325]  So, I mean, to see or to hear the fact that he was going to charge
[01:12:51.886 --> 01:12:55.027]  That kind of goes with it, whether or not the cops should have shot him?
[01:12:55.047 --> 01:12:57.227]  Yeah, I mean, that's completely and totally out of control.
[01:12:57.267 --> 01:12:59.047]  I mean, this guy has tons of kids.
[01:13:00.148 --> 01:13:02.108]  Sorry, I mean, he was passionate about what he did.
[01:13:02.148 --> 01:13:03.288]  I mean, that's fine.
[01:13:03.508 --> 01:13:05.509]  We're passionate about what we do and what we believe in.
[01:13:06.029 --> 01:13:08.389]  You know, I think that it was handled poorly.
[01:13:08.949 --> 01:13:18.591]  And at the same time, I still don't think it was very smart, though, to be heading off that place when you know that the FBI was looking for every single chance possible to take you guys out.
[01:13:19.231 --> 01:13:32.558]  Well, this high-profile militant, John Ritzheimer, who was one of the big cheerleaders, and you also uncovered one of his demonstrations, the armed march by the Mosque in Phoenix, which people have a right to do.
[01:13:32.618 --> 01:13:33.639]  I'm all about open marches.
[01:13:33.719 --> 01:13:34.599]  It is provocative.
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:42.524]  He left that morning and just said suddenly, he said he'd never really go, but he said he wanted to see his family and just ran back to them right on time.
[01:13:43.359 --> 01:13:49.421]  Yeah, they actually picked him up and he is in jail, he's in custody in Arizona right now as well.
[01:13:50.382 --> 01:14:01.286]  So, there's definitely a lot of parts to this, so I guess when we get out there we'll be able to try to figure out, maybe talk to some of the people, the eyewitnesses who saw what happened and try to get a little insight on what's happened.
[01:14:01.306 --> 01:14:08.909]  You know, a lot of people's emotions, they're going to take statements when their adrenaline's kicking and it might change, so we'll see what we find out when we get there.
[01:14:10.305 --> 01:14:11.948]  Let's go ahead and get to this article.
[01:14:12.068 --> 01:14:15.874]  Paul Joseph Watson links to the other articles where it's quoted.
[01:14:15.974 --> 01:14:18.017]  Eyewitness Oregon militiamen murdered by cops.
[01:14:18.218 --> 01:14:19.219]  He had his hands in the air.
[01:14:19.259 --> 01:14:20.581]  Daughter, he was shot in the face.
[01:14:21.323 --> 01:14:23.386]  And Victoria Sharp, who was in the car.
[01:14:24.605 --> 01:14:34.271]  With the group, when they were pulled over by the police and federal agents, Sharp claims that Finnecom put his hands out of the car window and asked the police to allow the woman to leave the car.
[01:14:34.752 --> 01:14:38.794]  They shot at him, and we know that reportedly one of the Bundy brothers got grazed.
[01:14:39.395 --> 01:14:40.375]  So that's just crazy.
[01:14:41.236 --> 01:14:48.581]  They shot at him, but they missed, Sharp said, adding that the group then attempted to drive away in the car, but were shot at again by police.
[01:14:49.301 --> 01:14:50.082]  Well, that's just terrible.
[01:14:51.403 --> 01:14:54.746]  And I believe her, because first they said, shoot out with no proof.
[01:14:54.966 --> 01:14:56.887]  Now they admit he didn't shoot at him and they shot him.
[01:14:58.028 --> 01:15:01.131]  And it fits with, you know, him running towards him saying, you know, go ahead and shoot me.
[01:15:01.751 --> 01:15:06.315]  When we crashed and stopped for a second time, he got out of the car.
[01:15:06.375 --> 01:15:07.596]  He had his hands in the air.
[01:15:07.896 --> 01:15:08.357]  He just
[01:15:10.083 --> 01:15:12.605]  He's like, just quote, shoot me then, and they did.
[01:15:12.685 --> 01:15:13.666]  They shot him dead.
[01:15:13.946 --> 01:15:16.248]  Sharpe said he was just walking with his hands in the air.
[01:15:16.688 --> 01:15:22.412]  I swear to God, and I'm quoting her, and they shot him dead, and his hands were down on the ground.
[01:15:22.472 --> 01:15:25.194]  Shot him three more times, said Sharpe.
[01:15:25.434 --> 01:15:35.562]  Well, you know, Senator Reid, the gangster, said, we're going to come after you, we're going to get you, and you're a terrorist.
[01:15:37.264 --> 01:15:41.287]  These are globalists that run America that have killed millions of people and launched false wars.
[01:15:41.708 --> 01:15:49.994]  You're going up against them, folks, and so know that they went through and talked to the feds and found out which ones wanted to go out here and do this.
[01:15:50.034 --> 01:15:59.521]  And if this is true, and the evidence is pointing towards it, they were told, you kill them and just, you know, make it look plausible and you will be promoted.
[01:16:00.282 --> 01:16:03.765]  You will get bonuses, you know, for combat or whatever, like they give them, and medals.
[01:16:04.465 --> 01:16:05.626]  And so this is sick.
[01:16:05.966 --> 01:16:08.608]  And I want those squad car videos released now.
[01:16:08.968 --> 01:16:09.409]  Joe Biggs?
[01:16:09.429 --> 01:16:10.249]  I mean, what do you think, though?
[01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:11.590]  You're driving down the road.
[01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:12.551]  They shoot at you.
[01:16:12.991 --> 01:16:15.293]  They almost take off another person's head or something like that.
[01:16:15.913 --> 01:16:16.534]  Aiman's brother.
[01:16:17.134 --> 01:16:18.755]  Then they shoot again at the vehicle.
[01:16:19.316 --> 01:16:26.541]  Of course, I mean, some people are going to get out angry as hell and start walking, confronting him, saying, hey, why are you shooting at me?
[01:16:26.561 --> 01:16:27.102]  Here's the deal.
[01:16:27.222 --> 01:16:27.662]  Shoot at me.
[01:16:27.802 --> 01:16:29.283]  I mean, I'm not saying that I wouldn't do that.
[01:16:29.363 --> 01:16:29.924]  Maybe I would.
[01:16:29.964 --> 01:16:30.504]  I don't know.
[01:16:30.644 --> 01:16:34.067]  I would be, in that moment in time, my adrenaline pumping, angry.
[01:16:35.128 --> 01:16:36.268]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[01:16:37.089 --> 01:16:41.772]  They didn't say this, but some of the others are all on record saying, we're ready to die.
[01:16:41.813 --> 01:16:43.073]  We're ready to have it start here.
[01:16:43.113 --> 01:16:44.414]  We've got guns.
[01:16:44.434 --> 01:16:45.575]  We're not going out alive.
[01:16:46.016 --> 01:16:46.456]  We've heard that.
[01:16:46.476 --> 01:16:47.377]  How many times did you hear that?
[01:16:49.517 --> 01:16:54.360]  You know, the feds are told to go after these people and they supposedly have guns and they've said they're not going to be taken alive.
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:56.442]  It's kind of armed and dangerous.
[01:16:56.462 --> 01:17:02.065]  It's like if somebody has told me they're not going to, you know, they're coming after me and then I see them outside my backyard.
[01:17:02.306 --> 01:17:06.228]  Well, the interesting thing is, is the time that I was there, I never saw any guns except for one gun.
[01:17:06.508 --> 01:17:06.849]  One time.
[01:17:07.901 --> 01:17:12.004]  And that's when Lavoie Finnegan came up there and made that stand saying, hey, if you guys are going to arrest me, come arrest me.
[01:17:12.464 --> 01:17:13.525]  And he had that long rifle.
[01:17:13.545 --> 01:17:15.065]  That was the only time I ever saw him.
[01:17:15.085 --> 01:17:15.886]  Out there with a sleeping bag.
[01:17:15.906 --> 01:17:16.967]  Yeah, out there with a sleeping bag.
[01:17:17.207 --> 01:17:20.889]  So maybe they took that saying, hey, they wanted to go after him because they knew he had a gun.
[01:17:20.909 --> 01:17:22.830]  It was all over the TV, all over the news.
[01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:23.871]  They could prove that.
[01:17:24.251 --> 01:17:26.072]  So maybe that's what they were going to use.
[01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:28.114]  That they wanted to use him as that person.
[01:17:28.774 --> 01:17:31.656]  I mean, it's completely a horrible tragedy that happened.
[01:17:32.176 --> 01:17:33.297]  Sure, but I mean, here's the deal.
[01:17:33.317 --> 01:17:34.758]  They're trying to start World War III.
[01:17:35.058 --> 01:17:38.220]  Our troops are in a proxy war with the Russians in Ukraine.
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:42.103]  They were in one in Syria, but our military refused to be part of it because they're not going to back Al-Qaeda.
[01:17:42.463 --> 01:17:48.147]  The troops can be talked into, and the officers into backing Ukrainians against the Russians, but they're like radical jihadis that want to kill us.
[01:17:48.667 --> 01:17:50.208]  I mean, this whole thing is melting down.
[01:17:50.268 --> 01:17:55.872]  We told you there was a mutiny, a good mutiny, like against Hitler, inside the military against what the globalists are doing.
[01:17:56.653 --> 01:17:59.435]  So what I'm saying is a lot of military, a lot of police, and a lot of feds.
[01:17:59.495 --> 01:18:02.217]  I mean, I talked about Gino and a lot of other folks off record.
[01:18:02.677 --> 01:18:04.218]  I mean, the FBI listens.
[01:18:05.119 --> 01:18:08.501]  Even the ATF listens and has been leaking stuff.
[01:18:08.521 --> 01:18:09.322]  The federal marshals.
[01:18:09.482 --> 01:18:11.544]  I was waiting on the FBI to come bust down my door last night.
[01:18:11.624 --> 01:18:13.265]  Oh yeah, I'm glad you brought this up.
[01:18:13.305 --> 01:18:14.026]  Let's bring this up.
[01:18:14.046 --> 01:18:15.387]  Let's show the ADL article.
[01:18:15.427 --> 01:18:17.369]  In fact, I meant to send them a letter from my lawyer.
[01:18:17.389 --> 01:18:19.671]  We're going to do this because I've tried to sue them before and they've retracted.
[01:18:20.092 --> 01:18:26.397]  When they wrote some articles saying I wanted to kill Mexicans, and I never said that, and you know, that came across the border, I made them change it.
[01:18:26.818 --> 01:18:28.519]  And so I've got to stay on them when they do that.
[01:18:28.859 --> 01:18:29.880]  Anatomy of a standoff.
[01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:30.081]  ADL.
[01:18:30.121 --> 01:18:32.303]  This is who advises departments around the country.
[01:18:32.843 --> 01:18:35.766]  It says that you basically organized it, stormed it,
[01:18:36.466 --> 01:18:37.086]  We're good to go.
[01:18:56.832 --> 01:19:01.218]  You know the... You ought to go after the Nazi war criminal that you give awards to, George Soros.
[01:19:01.238 --> 01:19:01.799]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:19:01.819 --> 01:19:07.927]  I'm saying, you know the FBI's looking at the ADL, the SPLC, and all this stuff, and I'm sitting here thinking, alright, alright, they're already starting to arrest people.
[01:19:07.947 --> 01:19:09.689]  They just picked up Reisheimer in Phoenix.
[01:19:10.655 --> 01:19:13.777]  I'm in Austin, what's going to keep them from banging down my door at my place?
[01:19:14.177 --> 01:19:26.265]  So I was sitting there all night kind of like, all right, well, I guess it's going to happen because I'm already being told that I'm part of the whole standoff, that I was down there hanging out with the militiamen at the Wildlife Refuge when I was actually granted access once for a tour.
[01:19:26.565 --> 01:19:29.227]  And then another time we were supposed to have an interview with Amon Bundy.
[01:19:29.527 --> 01:19:32.889]  And then that got called off because he got intel that the FBI was going to raid.
[01:19:32.929 --> 01:19:33.830]  Intel, yeah, from them.
[01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:35.531]  They never gave him the intels he got a look at.
[01:19:35.911 --> 01:19:36.572]  We'll talk to Alex.
[01:19:36.612 --> 01:19:37.212]  He's a Fed.
[01:19:37.232 --> 01:19:39.654]  Meanwhile, the ADL is saying, Alex Jones!
[01:19:39.694 --> 01:19:40.294]  I mean, let's go.
[01:19:40.334 --> 01:19:41.936]  It's Alex Jones and Joe Biggs.
[01:19:41.956 --> 01:19:42.876]  You know, we're all part of this.
[01:19:42.896 --> 01:19:43.417]  Let's go to it.
[01:19:45.438 --> 01:19:47.160]  We'll put that up on screen for TV viewers.
[01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:52.043]  Based in Austin, Texas, Biggs is a reporter for the right-wing conspiracy website Infowars, run by Alex Jones.
[01:19:52.103 --> 01:19:53.704]  Biggs first achieved it on a ride, and then goes through it.
[01:19:54.525 --> 01:20:02.171]  Biggs, a former Army Ranger, I mean, Army veteran, came forward, and it just goes on to basically how you are all part of this.
[01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:03.412]  This is just crazy.
[01:20:03.432 --> 01:20:05.033]  They put reporter in quotation marks.
[01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:06.153]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:20:06.193 --> 01:20:08.835]  I mean, you're so-called a civil rights organization, too.
[01:20:08.875 --> 01:20:11.856]  Why be held hostage by your wireless carrier for two years?
[01:20:12.096 --> 01:20:18.860]  What if you had no contract, no activation fees, no hidden costs, tracking, tracing, harvesting customer data, or draconian gimmicks?
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.341]  All on the nation's best 4G LTE network.

[01:21:38.834 --> 01:21:39.614]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:21:39.634 --> 01:21:41.135]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:21:41.455 --> 01:21:42.736]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:21:43.096 --> 01:21:45.437]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:21:45.917 --> 01:21:47.778]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:21:48.218 --> 01:21:52.260]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:56.422]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:21:56.662 --> 01:22:00.124]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[01:22:00.444 --> 01:22:00.864]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:22:00.884 --> 01:22:02.505]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:22:08.095 --> 01:22:12.897]  As your body ages, there is a 10% decline in your ability to repair each passing decade after the age 28.
[01:22:13.557 --> 01:22:19.520]  By age 40, your ability to repair from demanding manual labor, exercise, or a stressful desk job has declined by 12%.
[01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:25.062]  By using One World Whey, you supercharge your body's ability to repair and eliminate inflammation.
[01:22:25.263 --> 01:22:33.006]  Our unique, frequency-encoded whey protein, coupled with our high-quality whey, improves your cell's ability to make protein, which is to say, repair itself.
[01:22:33.086 --> 01:22:35.327]  My name is Jonathan Wright, and I'm 40 years old.
[01:22:35.407 --> 01:22:38.188]  I recently went from a desk job to a manual labor job.
[01:22:38.249 --> 01:22:39.229]  Normally, I'm worn out.
[01:22:39.369 --> 01:22:44.972]  With Energy Enhanced One World Way, I now recover so quickly that I can perform very hard work all day long.
[01:22:45.172 --> 01:22:50.254]  I use Energy Enhanced One World Way for breakfast and lunch, and I experience less hunger throughout the day.
[01:22:50.534 --> 01:22:53.356]  I have a 30% increase in energy, and I just feel better.
[01:22:53.656 --> 01:22:57.278]  I plan to make Energy Enhanced One World Way a permanent part of my lifestyle.
[01:22:59.079 --> 01:23:10.895]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[01:23:10.935 --> 01:23:14.419]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[01:23:15.638 --> 01:23:18.799]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[01:23:19.119 --> 01:23:24.182]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[01:23:24.562 --> 01:23:25.782]  How is this even possible?
[01:23:26.042 --> 01:23:33.365]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit had been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[01:23:33.585 --> 01:23:41.008]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[01:23:41.229 --> 01:23:44.430]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[01:23:44.710 --> 01:23:52.134]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[01:23:52.514 --> 01:23:55.235]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[01:23:55.696 --> 01:23:59.838]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[01:23:59.858 --> 01:24:00.498]  That's Greens75.com.
[01:24:00.518 --> 01:24:00.898]  Greens75.com.
[01:24:20.689 --> 01:24:25.031]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[01:24:26.432 --> 01:24:34.335]  I'm gonna say one more thing about the Bundy situation and the ongoing fact that the wildlife refuge is surrounded with whoever's in there.
[01:24:37.597 --> 01:24:41.579]  Obviously, whoever's in there let the feds know that the Bundys who hadn't left in a week had just left.
[01:24:42.139 --> 01:24:44.520]  The Bundys had also refused to meet with the FBI last week.
[01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:45.681]  They told them it was their last chance.
[01:24:48.129 --> 01:25:10.149]  It's been declassified and come out in congressional hearings that in the 80s, late 80s and 90s, the foundations, the Southern Poverty Law Center, others, the federal government, went out and created militia groups to falsely lead them and make them do discredited things and racist things to discredit the idea of a militia.
[01:25:11.186 --> 01:25:19.052]  And then they'd always have the feds, who came out to be feds later, not just informants, but actual FBI and foundation operatives, because they're really in command.
[01:25:20.773 --> 01:25:39.427]  They would then come out and say, I was bad, I was a fed, because I was pointing out that there were obviously globalist leading different organizations that were getting media coverage to discredit the right wing, the patriot movement in America, and to make the police hate them.
[01:25:40.404 --> 01:25:47.426]  And to try to make their ideology anti-police, so that they'd be, you know, dumb enough to then set the battle space that way.
[01:25:48.766 --> 01:25:50.467]  They're lining us up for a civil war.
[01:25:50.507 --> 01:25:52.167]  They've been trying it for a long time.
[01:25:54.188 --> 01:26:02.430]  And when you study these tactics for 25 years, like I have, 21 years now, on air, you see it a mile away.
[01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:08.812]  I mean, I saw Atari Militia on YouTube, and the media covered it, and I looked at what they said and what they did.
[01:26:10.049 --> 01:26:12.471]  And I said, that's 100% government produced.
[01:26:13.912 --> 01:26:15.173]  That is professionally done.
[01:26:17.535 --> 01:26:20.238]  It's meant to look like it wasn't professionally done.
[01:26:20.838 --> 01:26:24.561]  It's like when you see something that's supposed to be a documentary and you can tell it's fake.
[01:26:24.601 --> 01:26:26.043]  I mean, I'm a filmmaker, folks.
[01:26:26.103 --> 01:26:26.963]  I'm a media person.
[01:26:27.684 --> 01:26:34.009]  And I warned Hattari, because they were a good organization overall, you've got people in your organization near the top that are feds.
[01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:35.831]  You need to do something about it.
[01:26:36.211 --> 01:26:36.732]  And then, man,
[01:26:37.895 --> 01:26:44.118]  They ended up setting them up, sending them to prison, or imprisoning them for over a year waiting for trial.
[01:26:44.438 --> 01:26:47.040]  And the judge even said, you set them up, this was made up.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:50.922]  The FBI led the group and got them to make the statements.
[01:26:55.644 --> 01:27:00.086]  So, I tell you a group simple traded by Feds, folks, and then it happens.
[01:27:01.547 --> 01:27:03.208]  And it was run by Feds for years.
[01:27:04.269 --> 01:27:15.453]  And then they have the usual operatives in Michigan and other areas get up on TV and get up on radio and say Alex Jones is a Fed.
[01:27:15.833 --> 01:27:28.678]  He says the militia is unconstitutional and is all run by Feds and he says you're a Fed and you're a Fed and you're a Fed and tells every well-meaning militia person who cares about this country and is getting ready for what's happening that I say they're a Fed.
[01:27:29.378 --> 01:27:31.540]  And then they like the emotional camaraderie.
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:32.381]  They want to agree.
[01:27:32.661 --> 01:27:33.762]  You care about me?
[01:27:33.822 --> 01:27:35.864]  You told me what the big Alex Jones said?
[01:27:36.224 --> 01:27:36.945]  Thank you!
[01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:43.090]  And then even when it comes out, I didn't say a word about him or even know who they are, they still hate him because he said they were a fed.
[01:27:46.073 --> 01:27:46.913]  And I've watched it.
[01:27:46.953 --> 01:27:52.698]  I've even had the feds threaten me before and go, you idiot, you're not going to be able to ever get those bumpkins to listen to you.
[01:27:52.759 --> 01:27:53.299]  And you know,
[01:27:54.335 --> 01:28:00.840]  I see him at the gas station when I'm at some, you know, standoff in East Texas, and the feds pull up, get out, laugh at me in my face.
[01:28:02.301 --> 01:28:04.963]  I had the ATF come up and threaten me at the gun show.
[01:28:05.023 --> 01:28:05.963]  I'm not even selling guns.
[01:28:06.424 --> 01:28:07.645]  I've had them try to set me up.
[01:28:07.725 --> 01:28:08.866]  I mean, it's just been horrible.
[01:28:10.327 --> 01:28:11.868]  And you can see them a mile away.
[01:28:11.928 --> 01:28:13.549]  They have a criminal look to them.
[01:28:14.209 --> 01:28:20.454]  The agents they use for this political stuff against the patriots have been vetted as leftist scum, many of them.
[01:28:22.079 --> 01:28:24.320]  And they really want to mount Patriots' heads on the wall.
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:38.747]  And so I warn Patriots, don't hide out in the bushes with people that you think are your buddies, all day long, and that are telling you to do illegal things, or telling you to be all paranoid, you know, playing army.
[01:28:40.688 --> 01:28:49.852]  A real militia in the Info War would be wearing a suit and tie at the City Council, the legislation would be running for office, but also doing firearms training,
[01:28:50.967 --> 01:28:57.311]  And you'd be doing mount training, not wear Southeast Asia camo from Vietnam and then run around in the woods.
[01:28:59.472 --> 01:29:02.134]  Usually led by the feds that is the squad leader.
[01:29:04.475 --> 01:29:06.636]  And it's come out hundreds of times.
[01:29:07.397 --> 01:29:09.658]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times.
[01:29:09.678 --> 01:29:18.904]  I mean, it's almost... In fact, the old joke was on 60 Minutes, they had a show about it, about it at a good old boy roundup meeting in Alabama, put on by the ATF.
[01:29:20.339 --> 01:29:35.448]  That the joke was at a Klan meeting or a militia meeting, and I'm not saying the two are the same, that there would be more feds at the meeting than there would be patriots and the feds would have to have secret hand signs so they wouldn't set each other up.
[01:29:36.522 --> 01:29:37.723]  I mean, it's that bad, folks.
[01:29:38.363 --> 01:29:48.048]  I've had them, no exaggeration, probably 30 plus times, come up to me at a book signing, a video signing, an event, and go, listen, I got C4 in my truck out there right now, let's go blow up the police station.
[01:29:48.308 --> 01:29:50.489]  And I go, get the camera on, get the camera on, this person's a cop!
[01:29:50.649 --> 01:29:54.091]  And they run out and they got a cop car, you know, unmarked, fed.
[01:29:54.411 --> 01:29:56.052]  And they'll go, I'll get you later, Jones!
[01:29:58.173 --> 01:29:59.054]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.574 --> 01:30:01.155]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.095 --> 01:30:04.797]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.209 --> 01:30:12.891]  You hear a lot about the cashless society, but Europeans aren't buying it.
[01:30:13.131 --> 01:30:21.836]  According to the European Central Bank, a record 1 trillion euros of banknotes were in circulation in 2015, almost double the value 10 years ago.
[01:30:22.156 --> 01:30:24.277]  Paper money in circulation rose 6.5% last year, the most since 2008.
[01:30:28.179 --> 01:30:32.782]  2008!
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:32.782]  People were worried about financial turbulence and crashing markets then with good reason.
[01:30:32.962 --> 01:30:37.344]  And this year has begun with the worst two-week start on record for financial markets.
[01:30:37.664 --> 01:30:41.886]  But in 2015, we now have negative interest rates on bank accounts.
[01:30:42.346 --> 01:30:45.848]  And the risk of flat-out confiscation of accounts by government.
[01:30:45.928 --> 01:30:47.569]  What they call haircuts.
[01:30:50.290 --> 01:30:51.971]  And then there's privacy.
[01:30:52.051 --> 01:30:52.591]  Cashless?
[01:30:52.852 --> 01:30:53.252]  No thanks.
[01:30:54.153 --> 01:30:58.039]  Negative interest rates, risk of confiscation, economic uncertainty?
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:30:59.602]  I'll take it in cash.
[01:31:00.503 --> 01:31:04.930]  Paper notes may not be real money, but they sure beat negative interest and haircuts.
[01:31:05.671 --> 01:31:07.554]  For Prison Planet TV, I'm David Knight.
[01:31:08.752 --> 01:31:09.292]  I love my candy!
[01:31:09.312 --> 01:31:10.393]  I will never be again!
[01:31:10.453 --> 01:31:11.674]  Bye bye bye!
[01:31:38.712 --> 01:31:39.492]  I think so.
[01:32:08.410 --> 01:32:12.751]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male, and then when Super Female came out, tell us what happened.
[01:32:13.052 --> 01:32:17.653]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:32:17.813 --> 01:32:18.834]  Talk about the effects.
[01:32:19.134 --> 01:32:20.614]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:32:20.634 --> 01:32:22.235]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:32:22.575 --> 01:32:23.635]  I feel like I look better.
[01:32:23.695 --> 01:32:24.335]  I feel better.
[01:32:24.395 --> 01:32:25.496]  I feel sexier.
[01:32:25.796 --> 01:32:26.176]  I love it.
[01:32:26.436 --> 01:32:29.337]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[01:32:29.397 --> 01:32:32.098]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[01:32:32.338 --> 01:32:33.359]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:32:33.399 --> 01:32:34.440]  Consult your physician.
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.801]  Visit InfoWarsLive.com today.
[01:32:36.961 --> 01:32:37.902]  This is life-changing.
[01:32:38.282 --> 01:32:39.043]  Shower filters.
[01:32:39.183 --> 01:32:40.804]  We're introducing the best yet.
[01:32:40.924 --> 01:32:44.847]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[01:32:44.987 --> 01:32:49.591]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[01:32:49.811 --> 01:32:56.736]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[01:32:56.896 --> 01:32:59.718]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free shipping
[01:32:59.918 --> 01:33:02.620]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:30.379 --> 01:33:32.521]  The information he's got is so important.
[01:33:32.841 --> 01:33:37.845]  I had a guest coming on about how they plan to steal the election from Donald Trump, a parliamentary delegate expert.
[01:33:38.445 --> 01:33:45.371]  We're going to tape that, air it on the news tonight, and then play part of it tomorrow on the show, so we have more time with Mr. Plumlee, a little bit the next hour.
[01:33:45.971 --> 01:33:51.176]  So we've got about 45 minutes with him, a true Americana hero sitting right there.
[01:33:51.216 --> 01:33:54.018]  He'll say he isn't, we're going to him in about two minutes, but
[01:33:55.683 --> 01:33:58.524]  Again, folks don't know who Chuck Yeager is, most young people.
[01:33:59.324 --> 01:34:03.026]  This guy is one of the most important CIA whistleblowers in history.
[01:34:05.387 --> 01:34:06.907]  On record, look up Robert Tosh Plumlee.
[01:34:06.947 --> 01:34:16.651]  I mean, you're talking about church hearings, the Iran contract, key person, and still contracted with the CIA, because there's a good side and a bad side.
[01:34:17.617 --> 01:34:22.500]  And he blew the entire Benghazi situation wide open within months of it happening.
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:25.241]  It's all been validated, and he knows El Chapo.
[01:34:25.942 --> 01:34:27.783]  El Chapo, of course, was with the CIA.
[01:34:27.863 --> 01:34:29.484]  He's the number two guy.
[01:34:29.624 --> 01:34:33.646]  The extra got into Chicago a few years ago, and they had to let him go because he pointed out he was CIA.
[01:34:33.686 --> 01:34:37.108]  And the judge declared national security and said we had to let him go.
[01:34:37.828 --> 01:34:39.429]  So he can talk about the gun running.
[01:34:39.449 --> 01:34:42.592]  He told us about that three years ago to El Chapo, Fast and Furious.
[01:34:42.612 --> 01:34:44.473]  He's going to give you classified information on that.
[01:34:45.494 --> 01:34:48.737]  Every time he comes on, he gets threats, Justice Department, you name it.
[01:34:49.017 --> 01:34:50.238]  This isn't movies, folks.
[01:34:50.258 --> 01:34:53.120]  This is just like I met with Navy SEALs and their families.
[01:34:53.641 --> 01:34:58.825]  One Navy SEAL and two families a week after Benghazi and they told me all this.
[01:34:58.885 --> 01:34:59.686]  We broke that too.
[01:35:00.526 --> 01:35:02.168]  That's why Plumlee came on my show.
[01:35:03.432 --> 01:35:05.714]  This is death-defying stuff we're doing.
[01:35:05.934 --> 01:35:07.995]  And I'm not saying, oh, I'm a big man here.
[01:35:08.555 --> 01:35:12.217]  I'm saying you need to know how serious this is.
[01:35:13.118 --> 01:35:20.042]  Rush Limbaugh's come out, and the gloves are coming off, and said that Bernie Sanders won't really fight Hillary because he's afraid she'll shoot him twice in the head.
[01:35:21.483 --> 01:35:24.825]  Drudge linked our article with one of the Clinton victims saying she's afraid they're going to kill her.
[01:35:25.708 --> 01:35:32.694]  We just need to take the gloves off, they can't kill us all, and if they do kill Plumlee or myself or somebody, hey, that's just the way it is.
[01:35:33.335 --> 01:35:36.338]  We've gotten in this position because people turned into cowards.
[01:35:39.209 --> 01:35:46.231]  Now, we're going to go to Tosh Plumlee, who flew guns to Fidel Castro when he worked for Eisenhower, and worked, you know, knows El Chapo.
[01:35:46.951 --> 01:35:50.672]  And I don't know how much he'll get into today, because this is some really serious stuff you're about to hear.
[01:35:50.692 --> 01:36:00.275]  I mean, this is dangerous, this is real, this is Pulitzer Prize stuff, and of course you won't hear one word about it in the media until six months later, and they won't give anybody credit.
[01:36:00.495 --> 01:36:03.176]  And it's not that we want the credit, we need it to protect us.
[01:36:04.056 --> 01:36:06.538]  Fox News takes his info, my info.
[01:36:06.578 --> 01:36:08.460]  Months later, whitewashes it, but puts it out.
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:09.701]  We're going to go to him in just a moment.
[01:36:09.721 --> 01:36:12.222]  But first, paying the bills and getting you high quality products.
[01:36:13.604 --> 01:36:16.646]  Last week, I started talking about this because everybody in the office discusses it.
[01:36:16.786 --> 01:36:20.229]  Athletes, top MMA fighters I know, you name it.
[01:36:21.547 --> 01:36:30.390]  They go, my gosh, I got some of your DNA force, and I had numbness in the hands, my knee, my finger was cut off in a boating accident, falling off the boat and getting caught.
[01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:31.310]  They reattached it.
[01:36:31.330 --> 01:36:32.471]  It was numb on one side.
[01:36:32.951 --> 01:36:39.073]  I started taking DNA force when it first came out two and a half years ago, and it got a buzzing feeling for a few months.
[01:36:39.693 --> 01:36:40.513]  People kind of get freaked out.
[01:36:40.533 --> 01:36:41.794]  They go, whoa, my back hurts.
[01:36:41.834 --> 01:36:42.894]  It's like electrical now.
[01:36:43.314 --> 01:36:44.055]  It kind of hurts.
[01:36:44.295 --> 01:36:46.735]  And then feeling came back, and the pain went away.
[01:36:46.755 --> 01:36:49.716]  I mean, this finger, let's show folks a document cam shot of that.
[01:36:49.957 --> 01:36:50.797]  We're going to Tosh Plumlee.
[01:36:51.317 --> 01:36:53.939]  I mean, that sucker was... You guys show TV viewers?
[01:36:54.359 --> 01:36:56.581]  That sucker... Here, I'll set it right over here.
[01:36:56.601 --> 01:36:58.903]  It's kind of hard to turn my finger that way because that's the side that it cut off on.
[01:36:59.383 --> 01:37:06.328]  But the point is, is that it cut it off there, sliced through, and then peeled it off with skin holding it on the other side.
[01:37:06.589 --> 01:37:08.730]  So cut the finger off right there except for skin on the side.
[01:37:08.910 --> 01:37:11.472]  So only had feeling on this side where the nerves didn't get disconnected.
[01:37:11.773 --> 01:37:13.234]  No feeling on the tip and the front.
[01:37:14.475 --> 01:37:17.197]  Within a couple months of taking, and this is what happened to me personally,
[01:37:18.446 --> 01:37:22.265]  It started buzzing, electrical, hurting, and the feeling just came back one day.
[01:37:22.285 --> 01:37:22.828]  Just, it's back.
[01:37:24.710 --> 01:37:27.190]  And let me tell you, you hurt yourself when you don't have feeling in a finger.
[01:37:27.210 --> 01:37:28.751]  You don't know what you've done with it.
[01:37:28.771 --> 01:37:31.491]  You don't know when you're touching something hot.
[01:37:31.571 --> 01:37:32.811]  It's great to have the feeling back.
[01:37:33.272 --> 01:37:37.572]  Now, I'm always so careful, because the FDA and all the rest of it, that I don't make claims about any of the products.
[01:37:38.072 --> 01:37:38.692]  Just try them.
[01:37:38.712 --> 01:37:39.353]  They're amazing.
[01:37:39.853 --> 01:37:42.053]  Five-star reviews by top health sites.
[01:37:42.093 --> 01:37:42.873]  They're unprecedented.
[01:37:43.133 --> 01:37:43.933]  They're really that good.
[01:37:44.414 --> 01:37:45.614]  This is our best product.
[01:37:46.074 --> 01:37:49.014]  And I was almost, in a weird way, ashamed of it, because it cost so much.
[01:37:49.034 --> 01:37:50.835]  But it cost us $75 to $80 a bottle just to package it.
[01:37:53.544 --> 01:37:59.049]  You know, just to put the Bio PQQ in it, which is the equivalent of 300 pounds of blueberries.
[01:38:01.050 --> 01:38:08.096]  It's above vitamin C. I mean, you talk about in the winter, you know, for your immune system and stuff, this is the hydrogen bomb, okay?
[01:38:08.777 --> 01:38:11.459]  This is a nutraceutical, similar things to this sell for $300 to $600.
[01:38:11.639 --> 01:38:17.143]  You get it by prescription from doctors because they want to control it and keep the price high.
[01:38:17.324 --> 01:38:20.947]  And they're trying to control true organic Bio PQQ right now.
[01:38:22.156 --> 01:38:24.116]  Show that we can't even keep putting it out in the future.
[01:38:24.157 --> 01:38:26.697]  They've got a fake synthetic type that costs 50 bucks a bottle.
[01:38:27.397 --> 01:38:27.897]  Well, I know.
[01:38:27.957 --> 01:38:33.799]  It costs us, with the organic, 40, 35 to 40, sometimes more, to package each bottle just with the one ingredient.
[01:38:33.859 --> 01:38:34.979]  It's got a bunch of others.
[01:38:35.379 --> 01:38:36.900]  Find out why it's so important.
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:38.900]  CoQ10, everybody knows about that.
[01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:42.341]  There's 170 plus studies that we are allowed to tell you about.
[01:38:42.861 --> 01:38:48.989]  Because we bought it from Mitsubishi America that actually did the studies, has it certified, and it's sold as a drug in many countries.
[01:38:49.029 --> 01:38:56.058]  So, we are allowed to tell you deep research, patented ingredients, difficult to source is why we sell out of it a lot.
[01:38:56.299 --> 01:38:57.580]  It will sell out by next week.
[01:38:58.735 --> 01:39:01.797]  I'm doing a loss leader in a sale for $97, folks.
[01:39:02.518 --> 01:39:07.061]  We sell for $140, you know, we're just marking up 100% because we've got to fund the operation.
[01:39:07.501 --> 01:39:10.423]  A lot of other nutraceuticals are marked up 3, 4, 5, 6, even 7 times.
[01:39:10.723 --> 01:39:17.488]  So, InfoWarsLife.com, for a limited time, get a flagship nutraceutical, DNA Force, for 25% off at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:39:17.768 --> 01:39:18.589]  All supplies last.
[01:39:18.609 --> 01:39:21.311]  This is our most advanced product in the InfoWars store.
[01:39:21.771 --> 01:39:25.754]  We had to have a medical doctor even do the contract with Mitsubishi to get it.
[01:39:26.294 --> 01:39:29.799]  Because they go, we don't care, you know, if this is legal in the U.S.
[01:39:29.839 --> 01:39:31.161]  and isn't prescription, you gotta have it.
[01:39:31.702 --> 01:39:33.264]  I mean, that's just one of the ingredients.
[01:39:33.304 --> 01:39:34.285]  Some of the others are the same.
[01:39:34.526 --> 01:39:35.086]  They're just not $14,000 a kilo.
[01:39:37.545 --> 01:39:41.728]  It is known to be one of the most powerful antioxidants that protects your cells from free radicals.
[01:39:41.768 --> 01:39:42.908]  That's just the CoQ10.
[01:39:43.249 --> 01:39:45.770]  It's essential for basic cell function with the primary building blocks.
[01:39:46.050 --> 01:39:51.714]  The DNA force is loaded with the patented BioPQQ compound, which is backed by 175 clinical studies.
[01:39:52.054 --> 01:39:56.457]  Respected researchers, this amazing compound is known to influence nerve growth and regeneration.
[01:39:56.917 --> 01:40:01.380]  It is known to support the powerhouse of the cell, the mitochondria, that are the source of energy in the bodies.
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:03.101]  And just keep the cells young, folks.
[01:40:03.221 --> 01:40:06.803]  It is as close as you're going to get to what they were looking for in that fountain
[01:40:06.903 --> 01:40:08.244]  Florida 500 years ago.
[01:40:08.684 --> 01:40:11.465]  So I'm going to stop right there and go to our incredible guest.
[01:40:12.866 --> 01:40:14.627]  But this is also how you fund the operation.
[01:40:14.707 --> 01:40:16.908]  And we've got free shipping on orders of more than $50.
[01:40:16.968 --> 01:40:18.749]  And it's very expensive to run this operation.
[01:40:18.909 --> 01:40:22.051]  Legal is very expensive, as you can imagine, with the stuff we do and what we break.
[01:40:22.831 --> 01:40:25.753]  Sending our reporters out to the ongoing standoff with one dad.
[01:40:25.853 --> 01:40:26.833]  Could it be a new Waco?
[01:40:27.434 --> 01:40:28.134]  All this stuff.
[01:40:28.754 --> 01:40:29.515]  It's very expensive.
[01:40:29.535 --> 01:40:31.496]  So thank you for your support and your prayers.
[01:40:31.556 --> 01:40:35.598]  Now, obviously, when we put this on YouTube tomorrow, we're going to cut my plug out and cut right into
[01:40:36.581 --> 01:40:38.082]  Tosh Plumlee, so let me do that right now.
[01:40:38.562 --> 01:40:39.663]  We're live worldwide.
[01:40:40.504 --> 01:40:44.526]  Tosh Plumlee is Americana, makes me even more proud of Texans.
[01:40:45.047 --> 01:40:49.670]  Just so many times as Texans doing, you know, the hard work of standing up to tyranny.
[01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:52.952]  Amazing, one of the most famous whistleblowers in history.
[01:40:53.452 --> 01:41:06.041]  And because of the fact that he was found to be correct by Congress three times in three different major incidents, he kept his job as a major contractor, C-130s, another heavy lifting aircraft flying, you name it, around the world.
[01:41:06.801 --> 01:41:17.786]  Okay, and he is the source of so many Hollywood movies, films, you name it, that obviously don't even give the guy credit, but he is the... Before there was Air America in Vietnam, he was there.
[01:41:18.086 --> 01:41:23.049]  Fidel Castro, when he worked for the CIA in 59, 58, he was delivering them the weapons.
[01:41:23.829 --> 01:41:26.630]  El Chapo, Fast and Furious, he knows all about that.
[01:41:26.951 --> 01:41:29.192]  Benghazi, everything he said here three years ago.
[01:41:29.232 --> 01:41:30.032]  Go watch the interviews.
[01:41:30.232 --> 01:41:31.573]  We'll put them on screen for TV viewers.
[01:41:32.413 --> 01:41:33.215]  Uh, read the articles.
[01:41:33.295 --> 01:41:44.470]  It all came out on Benghazi and then Hillary hadn't fallen yet, but now they're bringing Bernie Sanders to the White House saying that, you know, they may actually double-cross Hillary and she may be indicted.
[01:41:44.851 --> 01:41:49.016]  Tom DeLay says the word from the FBI is if they don't indict her within a few weeks, we're going to Tosh.
[01:41:50.211 --> 01:41:54.315]  That they are going to bring out the info public.
[01:41:54.615 --> 01:41:59.439]  Now what's dangerous is they could start wars, they could pull anything with these different factions in the government.
[01:41:59.739 --> 01:42:05.024]  And I've got high-level sources and they can't even figure out exactly who's on whose side right now in the factions.
[01:42:05.264 --> 01:42:06.846]  Forget good guy, bad guy stuff.
[01:42:07.947 --> 01:42:11.129]  But we are joined by Robert Tosh Plumlee on Facebook.
[01:42:11.190 --> 01:42:14.332]  It's Robert.Plumlee.5.
[01:42:14.453 --> 01:42:18.256]  We'll send that out in a Twitter link for everybody and on Facebook.
[01:42:18.877 --> 01:42:20.338]  He's been censored by Facebook.
[01:42:20.378 --> 01:42:21.279]  He's been harassed.
[01:42:21.319 --> 01:42:22.820]  He's been, you know, subpoenaed.
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:24.542]  You name it for what you're about to hear.
[01:42:24.862 --> 01:42:28.726]  And I don't usually do build-ups like this, but I didn't do a build-up this big when Donald Trump came on.
[01:42:29.506 --> 01:42:31.047]  But this is a big deal.
[01:42:31.127 --> 01:42:38.269]  So he's got a whole stack of news that's since come out confirming what he told us three years ago, two years ago, a year ago, six months ago.
[01:42:38.749 --> 01:42:41.390]  And now he feels a lot safer to say even more.
[01:42:41.710 --> 01:42:43.471]  So let's go to Robert Tosh Plumlee.
[01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:45.212]  Robert, thank you for coming on, sir.
[01:42:46.372 --> 01:42:48.233]  Well, thank you, Alex, for having me back on.
[01:42:48.273 --> 01:42:51.354]  But wow, who is that guy you're talking about?
[01:42:52.705 --> 01:42:55.647]  Well, he's a guy that's got huevos the size of bowling balls.
[01:42:55.827 --> 01:43:02.290]  Breakdown the latest, Fast and Furious, it's coming out, El Chapo, Benghazi, you've got the floor.
[01:43:02.330 --> 01:43:02.650]  Go ahead.
[01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:05.651]  Okay, well, let me make a qualifier here.
[01:43:05.691 --> 01:43:12.035]  This call may be monitored by federal agencies, and that's about all I can say about that.
[01:43:13.355 --> 01:43:15.136]  Thank you for having me back on, Alex.
[01:43:15.176 --> 01:43:17.577]  I do appreciate it.
[01:43:17.757 --> 01:43:19.718]  I'm winging it as we go, I don't take notes.
[01:43:21.721 --> 01:43:31.127]  One of the main reasons, if you remember, we talked about Fast and Furious many years ago and made allegations that the U.S.
[01:43:31.167 --> 01:43:41.433]  made weapons, international weapons market, was shipping arms and ammunition to the Mexican army through the direct commercial sales program to Mexico.
[01:43:42.333 --> 01:43:52.981]  Made the allegation at that point in time that the Mexico Army was allowing those guns and ammunition to be pilfered and being sent to the cartel.
[01:43:53.862 --> 01:44:07.733]  What prompted me to get in touch with you and come back on your program was to bring up to date about those armed shipments from Fast and Furious that went to the Mexican Army, that was pilfered from the Mexican Army, and then went to the Sinaloa cartel.
[01:44:08.717 --> 01:44:10.779]  And that's El Chapo, who we met last week.
[01:44:10.819 --> 01:44:14.421]  They found in his hideout a .50 caliber Barrett from Fast and Furious.
[01:44:15.062 --> 01:44:25.609]  Right, and they also found .40 caliber anti-aircraft weapons at another location that was attributed back to Joaquin, or Shorty.
[01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:35.997]  But at that point in time, we were talking about, we lost a Border Patrol agent, Brian Terry, and I know you know about that.
[01:44:36.972 --> 01:44:47.779]  And the weapons that were attributed to his murder have recently been found, some of them, in the safe house there at Guzman.
[01:44:48.599 --> 01:44:54.262]  That hit the mainstream media news just very briefly and has been covered up since that time.
[01:44:55.343 --> 01:45:01.547]  That's the reason for me coming back on the show here, to bring attention back to mainstream media.
[01:45:02.327 --> 01:45:05.189]  Dropped that like a hot potato a couple of weeks ago.
[01:45:06.332 --> 01:45:08.273]  Uh, ATF has no comments.
[01:45:09.254 --> 01:45:17.958]  Uh, certain various people have made, um, requests for the ATF to produce the serial numbers of those weapons that was found in Guzman's hideaway.
[01:45:18.558 --> 01:45:20.519]  They have, to date, refused to do that.
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:22.020]  Comment from the U.S.
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:30.885]  State Department in reference to the direct commercial sales program that allowed those weapons to be shipped to the Mexican Army has no comment at this point.
[01:45:31.525 --> 01:45:34.966]  A series of emails were sent at that point in time.
[01:45:35.607 --> 01:45:36.967]  I'm talking about Fast and Furious.
[01:45:37.647 --> 01:45:54.334]  At that point in time, to the State Department, requesting a rundown on the amount of weapons that were shipped through the Blue Lantern Report and Direct Commercial Sales Program, shipped to the Mexican Army.
[01:45:56.195 --> 01:46:02.219]  That is now classified as a top-secret committee-sensitive investigation.
[01:46:02.299 --> 01:46:16.469]  And just to be clear, since you were first on three-plus years ago, it has come out in the Chicago Tribune and El Paso Times that indeed the number two under El Chapo, who was extradited, did bring up that he was working for the DEA and CIA going back for a decade.
[01:46:16.509 --> 01:46:20.972]  It was all sanctioned, that it was a war to take out other cartels, that they were being double-crossed.
[01:46:21.352 --> 01:46:22.293]  So that all came out.
[01:46:24.074 --> 01:46:29.599]  I'm going back from memory here, but specifically, what can you say about El Chapo, flights into Mexico?
[01:46:30.099 --> 01:46:34.142]  I mean, I think on, off record once and on record, you told me you know El Chapo, correct?
[01:46:35.303 --> 01:46:42.048]  I, well, I know, yes, I, okay, Carl Quintero also was another person to send a mix in this.
[01:46:42.569 --> 01:46:51.816]  And Carl Quintero and Joaquin Guzman were associates at Carl's Ranch in Guadalajara, outside Guadalajara.
[01:46:53.698 --> 01:46:57.561]  Carl Quintero had a warrant issued for him because of the Kiki Camarena murder.
[01:46:57.601 --> 01:47:00.303]  I'm not going to go into all that kind of stuff because it takes up too much time.
[01:47:00.963 --> 01:47:06.607]  But the lineage is there that, yes, Joaquin Guzman and his family.
[01:47:08.128 --> 01:47:10.490]  I've been privileged to meet him and talk to him.
[01:47:10.890 --> 01:47:12.931]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[01:47:13.812 --> 01:47:14.773]  DEA knows this.
[01:47:14.793 --> 01:47:16.514]  There's a whole complete file on this.
[01:47:17.254 --> 01:47:21.017]  We had undercover operatives working into that operation through the Mexican Army.
[01:47:21.078 --> 01:47:22.219]  I'm not Mexican Army.
[01:47:22.239 --> 01:47:23.540]  It's through the Mexican Marinos.
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:25.601]  And that goes back to Attach 47.
[01:47:25.922 --> 01:47:27.723]  It was working out of Fort Best, Texas.
[01:47:28.664 --> 01:47:40.374]  That was infiltrated into the arms deal about what was going on and guns going across the border into Mexico at that particular time.
[01:47:40.594 --> 01:47:44.658]  I don't want to get to rambling here, but my point being is that
[01:47:45.382 --> 01:47:56.043]  Those allegations that the cartel had US-made weapons involved in an international gunrunning operation that also included guns going to the Middle East, Libya,
[01:47:57.154 --> 01:47:59.555]  Uh, three, four years ago, I think those allegations were made.
[01:48:00.195 --> 01:48:10.019]  And I made a comment that it was a similar operation that's been going on for a number of years, all the way back before I ran Contra, going all the way back to Cuba.
[01:48:10.679 --> 01:48:20.023]  And now it's important because we have the 50 Cal, that's Fox News, AP, but then no other coverage from the government to El Chapo.
[01:48:20.944 --> 01:48:21.764]  Who's behind it?
[01:48:22.165 --> 01:48:24.608]  Obviously, it's connected to the federal government.
[01:48:24.988 --> 01:48:27.231]  And why are they burning El Chapo now?
[01:48:27.591 --> 01:48:28.633]  Why are they turning on him?
[01:48:30.731 --> 01:48:35.494]  Well, my opinion is we're going into an election.
[01:48:35.954 --> 01:48:52.043]  This information, not only from me, from many operatives, CIA as well as military operatives, some of them out of Fort Bliss, were operating inside Mexico at that point in time and also inside Libya at that period in time.
[01:48:54.048 --> 01:49:03.962]  They've got to make a diversion here, and they've got to make an example out of Guzman and others, or Carl Quintero, Zimbardo, and a whole list of them.
[01:49:04.222 --> 01:49:09.189]  Yeah, it's like, look at the bad man, oh my gosh, he's this horrible drug dealer, and meanwhile he's worked for the CIA for 30 years.
[01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.569]  Well, okay.
[01:49:09.589 --> 01:49:11.871]  The way it is with our mainstream media, I call it doctored.
[01:49:37.216 --> 01:49:43.558]  They are told what to say, what to cover, how far they can cover it, and all that.
[01:49:44.118 --> 01:49:53.982]  Alternative media, which I go on quite a bit when I have the opportunity, for the sole purpose of trying to get the truth about what's going on in those international gun running.
[01:49:55.122 --> 01:49:57.123]  Because that ties into Fast and Furious in Libya.
[01:49:57.143 --> 01:49:59.283]  We're going to break in one minute, but we'll come back with details.
[01:49:59.303 --> 01:50:00.324]  I know you just state the facts.
[01:50:00.724 --> 01:50:06.266]  Codify what the big new developments are that you're going to be going over with Fast and Furious, but also Benghazi.
[01:50:07.003 --> 01:50:21.726]  Okay, I want to point out real fast that the reason is the guns that were found on Joaquin Guzman are military-grade weapons, and some of those weapons trace back to the killing of Agent Brian Terry back in 2010, I believe it was.
[01:50:22.906 --> 01:50:29.087]  Those weapons have now shown up in the cartels, the Zeta, or Sononoa, rather, cartel.
[01:50:29.107 --> 01:50:29.868]  They've been showed up.
[01:50:30.028 --> 01:50:31.148]  Now, as far as Benghazi,
[01:50:32.128 --> 01:50:36.250]  The question that I'm trying to bring forward is that those two operations are identical.
[01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:39.291]  We run guns to Mexico, international gun running.
[01:50:39.611 --> 01:50:43.352]  We run guns to Benghazi, Libya, international gun running.
[01:50:43.472 --> 01:50:46.793]  We run guns to the southern front of Iran-Contra back in the 80s and 90s.
[01:50:49.194 --> 01:50:50.795]  Tosh Plumlee, stay there.
[01:50:50.875 --> 01:50:55.036]  We're going to come right back to you on the other side and let you flesh all this out.
[01:50:55.056 --> 01:50:57.937]  We really appreciate you giving us this time today, folks.
[01:50:57.957 --> 01:51:04.459]  This is really inside the crime syndicate up there that we know Hillary has been running through her State Department.
[01:51:04.479 --> 01:51:07.400]  We can pin it right on her and bring that pig down.
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:10.020]  Are you prepared to bug out?

[01:51:39.908 --> 01:51:41.409]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:41.729 --> 01:51:43.010]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[01:52:08.405 --> 01:52:15.127]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[01:52:15.487 --> 01:52:19.148]  It caught me totally by surprise and it involves FEMA.
[01:52:19.488 --> 01:52:22.449]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[01:52:22.889 --> 01:52:27.970]  Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.

[01:53:37.933 --> 01:53:40.674]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:53:40.974 --> 01:53:43.575]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:53:43.595 --> 01:53:44.035]  Croix River.
[01:53:44.355 --> 01:53:46.356]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:53:46.576 --> 01:53:49.316]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:53:49.537 --> 01:53:50.077]  His excuse?
[01:53:50.417 --> 01:53:51.497]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:53:51.757 --> 01:53:53.038]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:53:53.358 --> 01:53:58.859]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[01:54:17.361 --> 01:54:27.106]  You see what's happened is alternative media whistleblowers have brought out the fact that the big banks run America and they actually run the major drug trade.
[01:54:27.446 --> 01:54:30.548]  They keep it illegal to keep profits up and they control organized crime with it.
[01:54:30.988 --> 01:54:31.909]  And they corrupt the police.
[01:54:33.309 --> 01:54:36.591]  And they've used it to destabilize the third world, you name it.
[01:54:36.651 --> 01:54:37.992]  Now they're destabilizing the Middle East.
[01:54:38.012 --> 01:54:40.093]  They want to destabilize America and do the same thing here.
[01:54:42.202 --> 01:54:45.145]  And they use drug criminalization to do it.
[01:54:45.285 --> 01:54:50.891]  I'm not for the drug culture, but making it illegal makes it more dirty, makes it larger, it's out of control.
[01:54:51.772 --> 01:55:04.666]  Decriminalization is the answer, and anyone... I mean, you go see now movies with Josh Brolin, that's basically based on real stuff, but put into fiction, like Sakaro, which just means Hitman.
[01:55:05.976 --> 01:55:06.557]  I don't think so.

[01:55:30.057 --> 01:55:30.858]  Thank you for your support.
[01:55:31.118 --> 01:55:36.062]  Going back to Robert Tosh Plumlee, CIA contractor, whistleblower with huge developments.
[01:55:36.082 --> 01:55:37.424]  I remember him on Three Years Ago going,
[01:55:38.024 --> 01:55:40.489]  Look at El Chapo, Fast and Furious.
[01:55:40.529 --> 01:55:41.410]  That's where guns went.
[01:55:41.731 --> 01:55:43.113]  Now it came out in mainstream news.
[01:55:44.055 --> 01:55:44.335]  Wow.
[01:55:44.516 --> 01:55:47.661]  I mean, just everything he's talked about just keeps coming out years later.
[01:55:48.162 --> 01:55:48.723]  Amazing.
[01:55:50.072 --> 01:55:53.154]  Uh, we've only got five minutes of this segment, another five, then a twelve minute.
[01:55:53.174 --> 01:56:11.888]  These are short at the end and start of the hour, but I want to get back into Guns, sir, and Fast and Furious, and politically where this is all going with the factions, but separately, Fast and Furious, I'm surprised they put out a big official movie and basically admitted that it was a stand-down, but then of course you know why there was a stand-down.
[01:56:12.208 --> 01:56:13.769]  What more can you tell us about Benghazi?
[01:56:15.010 --> 01:56:15.450]  Okay, uh...
[01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:18.640]  Back to the other segment that we did.
[01:56:19.121 --> 01:56:25.982]  We've established that guns went across the border through the Direct Commercial Sales Program, U.S.
[01:56:26.062 --> 01:56:39.305]  State Department approved, through the Mexican Army, and those guns showed up in Joaquin Guzman's home, safe house, and those guns were responsible for killing Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.
[01:56:40.166 --> 01:56:41.207]  Okay, point two.
[01:56:41.847 --> 01:56:55.497]  I devised 11 Benghazi questions over three years ago to ask, number one, the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, also to ask the Secretary of State, John Kerry, to answer those 11 questions.
[01:56:56.037 --> 01:57:04.743]  Those 11 Benghazi questions were sent off to, I forget how many senators, there was over 20 senators and congressmen.
[01:57:04.843 --> 01:57:08.586]  The reason the questions were asked was to get these people on record.
[01:57:09.449 --> 01:57:13.281]  At that time, to say specifically, yes or no.
[01:57:13.422 --> 01:57:16.230]  Simple yes or no to those 11 Benghazi questions.
[01:57:18.692 --> 01:57:34.558]  The investigation that came out of that through other sources, don't talk about military sources, and CIA sources, is that the ambassador had found out about Stinger missiles being pilfered out of bunkers in Libya and other areas.
[01:57:35.238 --> 01:57:38.139]  Those weapons were sent back to the CIA safe houses.
[01:57:39.359 --> 01:57:40.600]  Stinger missiles were missing.
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:58:01.027]  The ambassador found out about that operation, I've said this three years ago, found out about that operation, asked the State Department through a series of quote emails and other dispatches what he should do about it because he had an opportunity through sources in Libya at that time before Qaddafi.
[01:58:01.767 --> 01:58:07.269]  He had an opportunity to buy back those Stinger missiles.
[01:58:07.833 --> 01:58:13.505]  He was told, quote, he was told to stand down on that purchase.
[01:58:13.825 --> 01:58:18.836]  Since that time, those weapons have been photographed in the back of Toyota pickup trucks.
[01:58:19.893 --> 01:58:23.614]  Stinger missiles, .50 caliber machine guns, all U.S.
[01:58:23.634 --> 01:58:30.035]  made weapons that were taken over to Libya and the Middle East.
[01:58:30.296 --> 01:58:30.956]  Tosh, stay there.
[01:58:30.996 --> 01:58:31.656]  Back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:31.776 --> 01:58:33.696]  Again, the breaks are at the end and start of the hour.
[01:58:34.096 --> 01:58:40.098]  Let me just throw out there, they're already putting out cover stories too, that, oh, ISIS made stingers on their own.
[01:58:40.778 --> 01:58:43.359]  Then you read the article and it goes, oh, actually they got old U.S.
[01:58:43.379 --> 01:58:44.479]  stingers and they fixed them.
[01:58:44.919 --> 01:58:48.100]  So they've already got the story out, like evolution.
[01:58:48.900 --> 01:58:50.701]  That life just came together on its own.
[01:58:50.722 --> 01:58:52.583]  You know, a watch was found in the desert.
[01:58:52.603 --> 01:58:53.604]  The sand just made it.
[01:58:54.024 --> 01:58:56.486]  Well, now these missiles, the Al Qaeda just made them.
[01:58:56.586 --> 01:58:57.467]  ISIS just made them.
[01:58:58.680 --> 01:58:59.600]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:00.041]  Good, brother.
[01:59:00.201 --> 01:59:01.881]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:59:02.162 --> 01:59:03.702]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:59:03.882 --> 01:59:07.904]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:59:07.924 --> 01:59:10.485]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:59:10.525 --> 01:59:12.746]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:59:12.946 --> 01:59:20.830]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:59:21.130 --> 01:59:24.232]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:59:24.353 --> 01:59:25.874]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:59:25.894 --> 01:59:30.297]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[01:59:30.597 --> 01:59:35.981]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[01:59:35.981 --> 01:59:37.461]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:21.127 --> 02:00:26.249]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:00:26.789 --> 02:00:29.170]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.150 --> 02:00:32.471]  Now think how crazy that is.
[02:00:32.511 --> 02:00:37.053]  Last month, and a few weeks ago, they come up with articles of the independent, you name it.
[02:00:37.913 --> 02:00:40.695]  ISIS has stinger missiles from the U.S.
[02:00:42.375 --> 02:00:43.496]  But that's buried in the article.
[02:00:43.536 --> 02:00:49.398]  It says they made them themselves, but then you read the article, now that's when you know a government agent or minion wrote that.
[02:00:50.444 --> 02:00:51.085]  It's a cover story.
[02:00:51.986 --> 02:00:52.727]  It's a talking point.
[02:00:52.867 --> 02:00:58.755]  Oh, ISIS developed sophisticated new weaponry capable of shooting down passenger jets, and then they admit it's U.S.
[02:00:58.775 --> 02:01:02.280]  Stinger missiles they somehow got, but they fixed the batteries on them.
[02:01:02.961 --> 02:01:05.625]  Oh, Tosh, I tell you, is that not amazing, sir?
[02:01:05.845 --> 02:01:07.788]  Confirming what you said here over three years ago.
[02:01:08.865 --> 02:01:10.345]  Well, yes, I believe it is amazing.
[02:01:10.445 --> 02:01:13.046]  And let me apologize for being a little bit nervous here.
[02:01:13.086 --> 02:01:18.547]  I'm getting into what they call some SAP stuff out of fusion centers out of the Pentagon.
[02:01:19.188 --> 02:01:20.148]  And I know this.
[02:01:20.268 --> 02:01:25.069]  And I'm going to qualify this and look straight into this camera and say, OK, what I'm talking about is above top secret.
[02:01:25.509 --> 02:01:26.570]  Hillary Clinton knows this.
[02:01:27.730 --> 02:01:35.552]  In fact, the dispatches and the emails that have since come out since I first mentioned this confirms what I just said.
[02:01:36.215 --> 02:01:38.996]  So this is SAP stuff, whatever you want to call it.
[02:01:39.656 --> 02:01:40.876]  It can be above top secret.
[02:01:40.916 --> 02:01:43.717]  It's not important how I get my information or who sends it to me.
[02:01:44.357 --> 02:01:55.000]  What I'm attempting to do here is point out to the general public and try to get people motivated to hold our elected officials accountable for these gunrunning operations.
[02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:55.500]  I understand.
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:58.160]  You got cut off though getting into the chain of events in Benghazi.
[02:01:58.220 --> 02:02:00.361]  A long segment's coming up in the next three, four minutes.
[02:02:00.381 --> 02:02:00.681]  Go ahead.
[02:02:01.863 --> 02:02:11.152]  Okay, so anyway, I devise those questions to simply get answers from officials, State Department, simple yes or no to those questions.
[02:02:12.173 --> 02:02:13.655]  And I'm not going to go into them all right now.
[02:02:13.695 --> 02:02:15.497]  They've been posted, posted, and posted.
[02:02:16.392 --> 02:02:18.594]  Uh, those questions were sent to our elected officials.
[02:02:18.634 --> 02:02:21.516]  They were sent to, uh, our congressmen and our senators.
[02:02:21.956 --> 02:02:29.682]  And the only thing responds that most of the people that sent those out to those people, the only thing they got back was letters asking for campaign contributions.
[02:02:30.343 --> 02:02:31.724]  Point two, where does the money go?
[02:02:32.624 --> 02:02:35.066]  All right, I'm not taking pop shots at Clinton.
[02:02:35.447 --> 02:02:37.048]  I'm not taking pop shots at anybody.
[02:02:37.088 --> 02:02:40.110]  I'm just trying to bring it all together, establish the record.
[02:02:40.931 --> 02:02:48.577]  Speaking fees, millions of dollars, missiles missing, Libya, all that kind of stuff.
[02:02:48.998 --> 02:02:55.163]  Where are our investigative reporters on mainstream media that will not ask those questions?
[02:02:57.697 --> 02:03:03.760]  You know, so anyway, please forgive me, but... Oh, sure, humble man, you're totally on target.
[02:03:04.181 --> 02:03:13.526]  The point is, here's my bigger question, why would they want to give thousands of missiles, hundreds of really high-tech ones we know, to Al-Qaeda slash ISIS?
[02:03:13.926 --> 02:03:17.568]  Why would our own elite do that when they're going to end up getting the blame for it later?
[02:03:19.069 --> 02:03:20.650]  The whole thing is based on money.
[02:03:21.330 --> 02:03:22.891]  We need to start wars.
[02:03:24.223 --> 02:03:24.824]  My opinion.
[02:03:24.984 --> 02:03:26.425]  We need to start the wars.
[02:03:27.005 --> 02:03:28.707]  We need to fund both sides of the war.
[02:03:28.727 --> 02:03:32.229]  Sure, but our elite's really getting crazy when they start giving jihadi stinger missiles.
[02:03:32.789 --> 02:03:38.253]  They think that we, our general public, has been so desensitized that we don't give a crap about what they're doing.
[02:03:38.293 --> 02:03:40.675]  They are so arrogant up there in Washington, D.C.
[02:03:40.695 --> 02:03:44.698]  that they're not in touch with the general American citizen.
[02:03:45.419 --> 02:04:08.730]  So, the point is this, we furnish weapons, we start the conflict, we furnish the weapons, to both sides of the conflict, and we keep the strategy, or keep the dissension going, we start it, we fund it, we send the guns, we take the money, and we take the money and put it back into campaign contributions, or into special foundations.
[02:04:09.810 --> 02:04:11.491]  That's what needs to be investigated.
[02:04:12.051 --> 02:04:14.873]  That's what they are refusing to investigate.
[02:04:15.434 --> 02:04:24.700]  The three-year record of me going on your program and other programs and posting on my Facebook page substituates those charges or allegations or whatever you want.
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:25.960]  By the way, it's more than three years.
[02:04:25.980 --> 02:04:27.301]  It's right after Benghazi.
[02:04:27.341 --> 02:04:29.703]  You've been coming on, you know, ever since then.
[02:04:29.723 --> 02:04:30.703]  And I'm sorry about these breaks.
[02:04:30.803 --> 02:04:32.885]  Again, there's more at the end and start of an hour.
[02:04:32.905 --> 02:04:34.406]  We're going to come back with a long segment, sir.
[02:04:35.026 --> 02:04:38.789]  And let you really roll through all of this on the other side.
[02:04:38.809 --> 02:04:41.331]  But I want TV viewers and radio listeners to understand something.
[02:04:44.394 --> 02:04:49.618]  Just like they brought in millions of radical jihadis out of Syria, those were invaders into Syria.
[02:04:49.658 --> 02:04:52.200]  They lost, so they now were allowed to come through Turkey into Germany.
[02:04:54.011 --> 02:04:58.819]  And you say, well then Merkel will get the blame, or Hollande will get the blame when they shoot stuff and blow stuff up.
[02:04:58.879 --> 02:04:59.140]  No!
[02:04:59.641 --> 02:05:03.868]  They've declared martial law over there and are arresting patriots!
[02:05:03.888 --> 02:05:06.592]  They're declaring it treason to criticize Muslims today!
[02:05:09.215 --> 02:05:19.098]  Join us this Thursday, January 28th as InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News bring you another installment of Political Science Theater 3K.
[02:05:19.218 --> 02:05:25.500]  If you have freedom of speech, like any free market, you do not use the government to shut down portions of it.
[02:05:25.700 --> 02:05:33.445]  Join David Knight, Jakari Jackson, Leigh-Anne McAdoo, and the rest of the crew as we crash through the lies and propaganda in real time.
[02:05:33.565 --> 02:05:43.551]  When we see the eight-year-old boy scout who can't fly a plane because he has the same name as some suspected terrorist, when he turns 16 he's not gonna be able to get a driver's license, he's not gonna be able to get a job, he's not gonna be able to get a college loan.
[02:05:43.831 --> 02:05:45.753]  Infowars.com, there's a war on for your mind!
[02:06:08.413 --> 02:06:08.853]  Hey, everyone!
[02:06:09.233 --> 02:06:11.474]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[02:06:11.514 --> 02:06:15.096]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:06:15.356 --> 02:06:16.957]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:06:17.437 --> 02:06:27.341]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:06:27.721 --> 02:06:33.704]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:06:34.164 --> 02:06:49.138]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[02:06:49.158 --> 02:06:49.598]  I think so.
[02:07:08.331 --> 02:07:14.716]  Our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[02:07:15.157 --> 02:07:18.259]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:24.605]  Needed to get my digestive system working correctly again so I stumbled on the X2.
[02:07:24.685 --> 02:07:28.108]  We look at a product like Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[02:07:28.308 --> 02:07:31.871]  It's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[02:07:32.171 --> 02:07:33.992]  I needed a detox basically.
[02:07:34.313 --> 02:07:34.733]  I started taking
[02:07:38.898 --> 02:07:42.362]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[02:07:42.562 --> 02:07:43.603]  What do you have to lose?
[02:07:43.884 --> 02:07:52.454]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[02:07:52.902 --> 02:07:56.744]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[02:07:56.764 --> 02:07:58.265]  I was like really more natural.
[02:07:58.545 --> 02:08:03.567]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:08:17.136 --> 02:08:24.819]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:30.081 --> 02:08:44.586]  We've got an update, briefly, and then we're going back to Tosh Plumlee, a huge Benghazi and, of course, Fast and Furious whistleblower.
[02:08:46.223 --> 02:08:50.765]  Our investigative journalist, Kit Daniels, is in the control room there.
[02:08:51.245 --> 02:08:53.186]  We're going to cut to that camera and microphone here in a moment.
[02:08:53.606 --> 02:08:59.348]  Briefly, Kit, we've got new developments with some of the folks inside the compound, inside the federal building.
[02:09:00.028 --> 02:09:01.208]  Again, we had one of them killed.
[02:09:02.109 --> 02:09:06.950]  The police shot him last night out there on the road after shooting at their vehicles.
[02:09:06.990 --> 02:09:08.171]  A huge escalation.
[02:09:08.211 --> 02:09:09.331]  The feds are out of control.
[02:09:10.792 --> 02:09:11.932]  It's really a tragedy.
[02:09:11.972 --> 02:09:13.793]  But what's the latest developments, briefly?
[02:09:14.343 --> 02:09:16.004]  Well, the situation's not over yet.
[02:09:16.244 --> 02:09:19.906]  What we're seeing is the preparations for another Waco-style siege.
[02:09:20.706 --> 02:09:27.970]  Like, even after all the arrests last night, there were still women, children, and other militiamen still in the compound, even though a couple of them fled.
[02:09:28.110 --> 02:09:36.554]  But, there's still guys that are in the compound, they're using excavators to build preparations for a siege from the FBI and potentially ATF.
[02:09:37.134 --> 02:09:41.536]  And today, they put out a video from the compound saying that, uh,
[02:09:42.697 --> 02:09:45.438]  That the media has been ordered to leave and that means they're coming to kill us.
[02:09:45.478 --> 02:09:46.478]  They don't want to see that.
[02:09:46.498 --> 02:09:47.878]  They're going to murder all of us.
[02:09:47.898 --> 02:09:50.599]  The media are cowards.
[02:09:50.859 --> 02:09:56.261]  They're basically saying that they're preparing to go toe-to-toe with the feds in a shootout.
[02:09:58.361 --> 02:09:59.542]  They're saying they're going to murder us.
[02:09:59.602 --> 02:10:00.542]  The media are cowards.
[02:10:00.782 --> 02:10:02.523]  We can put the story back on screen there.
[02:10:02.543 --> 02:10:06.144]  We're putting it up on Infowars.com where it shows the individual.
[02:10:06.164 --> 02:10:07.284]  Let's scroll back up to the top, guys.
[02:10:08.208 --> 02:10:10.390]  Yeah, he's one of the militia guys.
[02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:12.111]  Here's a headline from Raw Story.
[02:10:12.171 --> 02:10:14.974]  Berserk militant promises bloodbath as feds move in.
[02:10:14.994 --> 02:10:17.236]  This is a free-for-all Armageddon.
[02:10:17.796 --> 02:10:19.698]  I mean, this is just, and we warned these guys.
[02:10:20.038 --> 02:10:21.819]  We absolutely told them this was stupid.
[02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:25.042]  And then the media tries to spin it like we're in support of all this.
[02:10:25.322 --> 02:10:28.825]  So we're sending reporters to make sure that's on record and not the case.
[02:10:29.446 --> 02:10:29.946]  Anything else?
[02:10:29.966 --> 02:10:30.807]  Then I'm going back to my guest.
[02:10:31.007 --> 02:10:32.229]  Yeah, this isn't rhetorical.
[02:10:32.249 --> 02:10:34.792]  I mean, the police have already set up big perimeters, roadblocks.
[02:10:34.812 --> 02:10:37.034]  They're only letting ranchers in that live in the area.
[02:10:37.155 --> 02:10:38.296]  No other traffic allowed.
[02:10:38.336 --> 02:10:39.277]  Searching all vehicles.
[02:10:39.337 --> 02:10:41.880]  So this is definitely something we've got to keep on track.
[02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:43.803]  Alright, we'll stay on it at Infowars.com.
[02:10:43.823 --> 02:10:49.430]  There's also your latest article where doctors will just list you as not able to own a gun because they claim you're depressed.
[02:10:49.730 --> 02:10:51.391]  That's coming up at where Tosh Plumlee leaves us.
[02:10:51.411 --> 02:10:52.452]  Going back to Tosh Plumlee.
[02:10:52.472 --> 02:10:53.313]  Thank you, Kit Daniels.
[02:10:53.854 --> 02:10:54.714]  Back to Tosh Plumlee.
[02:10:55.055 --> 02:10:56.836]  Okay, we got about 10 minutes left here.
[02:10:56.876 --> 02:10:58.237]  We really appreciate you, sir.
[02:10:58.577 --> 02:11:03.221]  We'll put links to your Facebook up there so folks can read your 11 questions on Benghazi.
[02:11:03.622 --> 02:11:06.824]  As we went to break, we were pointing out, they ordered us to stand down.
[02:11:06.864 --> 02:11:12.289]  They told the Ambassador Stevens, you've had this from your NATO source, your U.S.
[02:11:12.349 --> 02:11:13.230]  Army source as well.
[02:11:13.570 --> 02:11:14.431]  It's all been confirmed now.
[02:11:14.451 --> 02:11:15.411]  It's all come out years later.
[02:11:16.348 --> 02:11:20.350]  What you said, when you put your life on the line, your reputation, your name, Mr. Plumlee, and we appreciate that.
[02:11:20.370 --> 02:11:25.513]  You say you're not a hero, but you are for not being a coward and doing the right thing, you know, for those that died there.
[02:11:25.853 --> 02:11:27.534]  And I think they've jumped the shark on this one.
[02:11:27.554 --> 02:11:28.714]  The military's so upset.
[02:11:28.774 --> 02:11:29.855]  The people know what happened.
[02:11:30.175 --> 02:11:32.596]  There's even Michael Bay movies, you know, telling the truth now.
[02:11:33.516 --> 02:11:34.777]  But they order a stand-down.
[02:11:34.857 --> 02:11:36.138]  Stevens doesn't go along with it.
[02:11:36.698 --> 02:11:44.422]  So they go in, they order a stand-down, but some other Navy SEAL sheep-dipped folks, they go and fight it.
[02:11:45.222 --> 02:11:47.043]  It goes on for eight hours after that.
[02:11:47.503 --> 02:11:56.648]  Now it's known, it's an open secret, but still, those involved, those responsible, Hillary and others, Obama, are sitting there hoping we all just forget about it.
[02:11:57.228 --> 02:12:06.595]  Where do you see all of this going and what are they planning to do when they bring in the migrants and they kill and rape and shoot and bomb and then they start shooting planes down with Stinger missiles.
[02:12:06.935 --> 02:12:09.597]  They already blew up a Russian plane with a bomb.
[02:12:09.617 --> 02:12:16.742]  I mean it's just how crazy are our elite to give Stinger missiles to Al Qaeda slash ISIS?
[02:12:18.464 --> 02:12:20.366]  Well okay, let me back up here.
[02:12:20.386 --> 02:12:23.989]  I want to thank you for bringing that previous clip in about Oregon.
[02:12:24.009 --> 02:12:30.575]  I've been very familiar with that and I've actually been talking to some of those people and counseling with them for the last 21 days.
[02:12:31.476 --> 02:12:33.357]  Again, thank you Alex for putting that clip in.
[02:12:33.377 --> 02:12:36.000]  Sure, what's your view on that then, since you've been following?
[02:12:36.820 --> 02:12:41.764]  Well, my view is it was predictable, and I've told the people out there that it was predictable.
[02:12:42.244 --> 02:12:52.052]  I told them not to let their government provoke them to anger, to watch what they say, and be careful how they present their facts to the federal government.
[02:12:52.632 --> 02:12:54.534]  I told them that two weeks ago.
[02:12:55.294 --> 02:13:10.803]  Or three weeks ago that they would be infiltrated by government agents for the sole purpose of provoking them to make them pull a weapon or threaten a federal agent or threaten a radical that's infiltrated their compound.
[02:13:11.843 --> 02:13:22.786]  Um, and we're spreading dissension so that the federal government could use that dissension as a justification to launch what is getting ready to be launched against those people now.
[02:13:23.666 --> 02:13:26.567]  I don't know if I've summed that up, but, uh... You've summed it up perfectly.
[02:13:27.067 --> 02:13:28.588]  We've got to stop a new Waco.
[02:13:28.608 --> 02:13:30.728]  Um, but last time it was children.
[02:13:30.768 --> 02:13:38.671]  This time it's the, you know, the quote, white Yale-kida that George Soros wants for his clash of civilizations.
[02:13:38.771 --> 02:13:39.591]  It's just a disaster.
[02:13:40.510 --> 02:13:46.475]  Also, it's set up as a diversion to keep our mind away from what's going on right now as far as this gun running situation.
[02:13:46.495 --> 02:13:55.442]  That's right, it's diverting us right now from El Chapo, caught with guns that Big Sis and Obama and Holder and Hillary sent to them, and Benghazi.
[02:13:55.462 --> 02:14:00.046]  It's working really well, so good job to the foundation operatives there in Oregon.
[02:14:00.286 --> 02:14:03.669]  You helped screw America over again, you trash.
[02:14:03.729 --> 02:14:05.611]  This is a procedure, this is an MO.
[02:14:06.071 --> 02:14:08.033]  This happened in Kent State, if you remember.
[02:14:08.053 --> 02:14:08.773]  That's right, it's an MO.
[02:14:09.474 --> 02:14:09.894]  That's right.
[02:14:09.955 --> 02:14:11.236]  It's a method of operation.
[02:14:11.336 --> 02:14:13.358]  It is one of those things that I talk about.
[02:14:14.399 --> 02:14:15.260]  It's an operation.
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:17.382]  Sometimes it's launched.
[02:14:17.862 --> 02:14:29.793]  If it works, then it's taken off the shelf, put back out in the field after it's been tweaked and organized and modified to fit this particular day and age.
[02:14:30.834 --> 02:14:31.875]  And it's a procedure to
[02:14:34.459 --> 02:14:39.903]  Destroy destroy our freedom ability of freedom, but I'm not going to get on a soapbox about about that.
[02:14:40.483 --> 02:14:43.566]  The point is those people out there in a very precarious position.
[02:14:44.106 --> 02:14:47.848]  You can pretty well predict what's getting ready to happen again.
[02:14:47.928 --> 02:14:50.830]  I want to get back to Benghazi and the questions.
[02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:52.451]  But again, I want to thank you for covering that.
[02:14:53.212 --> 02:14:58.115]  The voice of Idaho, the voice of Idaho has been covering that Michael is in position out there.
[02:14:58.656 --> 02:15:00.197]  Becky is following up on that.
[02:15:01.077 --> 02:15:03.339]  There's more information getting ready to break on this.
[02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:11.207]  I don't think the American people or anyone that is listening to this broadcast is really aware of what's getting ready to happen.
[02:15:11.627 --> 02:15:19.834]  This is a planned MO operation against those people, a diversion to take our mind away from the fast and furious situation.
[02:15:20.575 --> 02:15:23.958]  I'm sure the Bundys out there, who are well-meaning people, they've been totally shut up.
[02:15:23.998 --> 02:15:24.679]  And that's what I'm saying.
[02:15:24.719 --> 02:15:26.201]  When you're an expert, I'm an expert.
[02:15:26.561 --> 02:15:29.344]  You've been, you know, inside the government since the 50s.
[02:15:30.205 --> 02:15:30.865]  I've studied it.
[02:15:30.945 --> 02:15:32.447]  I've been following it for 20 years.
[02:15:32.847 --> 02:15:33.488]  You see it.
[02:15:33.588 --> 02:15:34.689]  It's totally synthetic.
[02:15:35.110 --> 02:15:35.830]  It's made up.
[02:15:36.211 --> 02:15:37.031]  It's scripted.
[02:15:37.352 --> 02:15:38.413]  It's a disaster.
[02:15:39.033 --> 02:15:44.219]  And as usual, the Patriot, you know, grassroots folks walked right into it.
[02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:47.290]  Well, that's exactly what it was.
[02:15:47.310 --> 02:15:48.090]  It was an ambush.
[02:15:48.891 --> 02:15:49.771]  That fits the M.O.
[02:15:49.791 --> 02:15:50.771]  that I was talking about.
[02:15:50.791 --> 02:15:52.372]  It fits the M.O.
[02:15:52.432 --> 02:15:55.413]  of infiltration into a particular group to spread dissension.
[02:15:56.214 --> 02:16:04.057]  And to get some of these people, sometimes they mean well, but they go to extremes.
[02:16:04.097 --> 02:16:06.958]  They don't present themselves, in my opinion, properly.
[02:16:07.238 --> 02:16:07.518]  Sure.
[02:16:07.558 --> 02:16:13.741]  Well, I mean, we specifically have actually dealt with some of the operatives that are
[02:16:15.199 --> 02:16:18.042]  heavily involved and I just, these poor people won't ever listen to me.
[02:16:18.342 --> 02:16:19.643]  If I wore camo, they would.
[02:16:19.663 --> 02:16:23.126]  I just, you know, it's just so sad.
[02:16:23.146 --> 02:16:25.509]  Maybe next time they'll listen.
[02:16:26.323 --> 02:16:45.217]  Alex, some of that stuff wearing camo is actually people dispatched by government sources, and I'm going to say it out straight out, right to your camera, by government sources to infiltrate that in their camouflage, to be extremely radical, and to rile those people up by a process of illusionary warfare training programs.
[02:16:45.617 --> 02:16:46.938]  Wow, you're so incredible.
[02:16:47.158 --> 02:16:48.879]  Tell them about illusionary warfare training.
[02:16:49.220 --> 02:16:50.020]  Well, that's what it is.
[02:16:50.100 --> 02:16:53.122]  It's a modified technique that's been used since the 1950s.
[02:16:53.162 --> 02:16:54.243]  It's infiltrated in.
[02:16:55.704 --> 02:16:58.566]  If you can control the communications, you've won the war.
[02:16:59.226 --> 02:17:00.167]  Or you've won the situation.
[02:17:00.187 --> 02:17:00.527]  That's right.
[02:17:00.667 --> 02:17:07.952]  Usually the communications person that, quote, handles all communications for the group is who you look for.
[02:17:08.632 --> 02:17:10.113]  We've had Malkinburg.
[02:17:10.153 --> 02:17:11.714]  That's an old CIA project.
[02:17:11.734 --> 02:17:14.056]  Now let me qualify something here on CIA.
[02:17:15.397 --> 02:17:24.803]  There are people that is infiltrated within the CIA that are CIA that some of the CIA do not even know it.
[02:17:25.638 --> 02:17:30.660]  So, we have a, now I'm not talking about rogues, I'm talking... No, they're shadow CIA.
[02:17:31.180 --> 02:17:38.242]  I'm talking about shadow warriors, you know, not from the standpoint of shadow warriors on organizations and things like that.
[02:17:38.702 --> 02:17:43.024]  I'm talking about there is a shadow government out there that is working these programs.
[02:17:43.564 --> 02:17:48.426]  The program is designed to desensitize us to where we expect exactly what the hell we're getting.
[02:17:48.446 --> 02:17:49.106]  That's right, let's be clear.
[02:17:49.386 --> 02:18:00.933]  The big foundations, the big leftist foundations run, but have the national security clearances, the clandestine, dirty programs against the patriots.
[02:18:01.594 --> 02:18:12.440]  And so a lot of times the local police, the FBI, even the CIA don't know it's the foundations that are even above the agencies with their action program here in the United States.
[02:18:13.141 --> 02:18:14.522]  All right, let me put it this way too.
[02:18:14.542 --> 02:18:15.762]  You hit it right on the head, Alex.
[02:18:15.902 --> 02:18:16.203]  Okay.
[02:18:17.123 --> 02:18:27.910]  Also, there's gatekeepers assigned into these organizations, our agencies, that prevent good, honest people that work for those agencies from doing their job.
[02:18:28.330 --> 02:18:29.651]  They're called cleanup people.
[02:18:30.091 --> 02:18:40.537]  They are assigned specifically and appointed into positions, you know, in the Pentagon, in the CIA, in the DOJ, or the State Department.
[02:18:40.997 --> 02:18:41.978]  They are processed.
[02:18:42.158 --> 02:18:45.220]  Anybody that comes out and goes against the policy
[02:18:46.462 --> 02:18:52.247]  The gatekeepers will make sure that their either career is ruined or they're transferred to another position.
[02:18:52.407 --> 02:19:14.085]  Or there's lastly people like Tosh Plumley and Colonel Schaefer and countless others and Joe Biggs and you know everybody from Ted Kennedy I mean Tim Kennedy to you name it who are patriots who are resisting it and aware now because they're decompartmentalized and know the program and that's the historic battle point we've gotten to and these foundations better watch it.
[02:19:15.605 --> 02:19:19.867]  People are bold against you now because you're not as strong as you used to be.
[02:19:20.047 --> 02:19:20.367]  Go ahead.
[02:19:20.507 --> 02:19:23.548]  Well, I've already been warned not to even be on this program right now.
[02:19:23.728 --> 02:19:25.569]  I mean, you know, hell, that goes towards the territory.
[02:19:25.729 --> 02:19:29.050]  I don't talk too much about that kind of stuff.
[02:19:29.130 --> 02:19:29.971]  I mean, that's what it is.
[02:19:30.371 --> 02:19:32.992]  That's the reason I'm out here going public here is to protect my butt.
[02:19:33.052 --> 02:19:36.233]  I'm not out here waving a flag and all that kind of stuff.
[02:19:37.073 --> 02:20:04.258]  The point being is that we have gatekeepers that are assigned to infiltrate and appointed by whatever administration it is, or whatever bureaucratic... Sure, Glenn Beck is an assigned gatekeeper, he admits he's hooked in with the government, and he literally takes the exact names of our shows and what we do, like Mystery Political Science Theater we're doing tomorrow night with the debate, and takes the exact name and then says it's his and I took it, three years after I'd made it.
[02:20:04.818 --> 02:20:16.462]  Well, CBS poached a story from Bill Conroy pertaining everything about Fast and Furious and the direct commercial sales program, put it out on the wire, tweaked it around, contaminated it, and put it out as their investigation.
[02:20:17.903 --> 02:20:33.368]  And there's an article done by Bill Conroy where CBS poached Bill Conroy's work in reference to the direct commercial sales program, which would have at that point in time, which you forgot the articles, that point in time would have opened up everything we're talking about right now.
[02:20:34.088 --> 02:20:36.009]  So, why was it stopped?
[02:20:36.069 --> 02:20:37.049]  Why was it diverted?
[02:20:37.109 --> 02:20:38.350]  Why was his investigation?
[02:20:38.430 --> 02:20:39.491]  What happened to Zimbardo?
[02:20:39.811 --> 02:20:41.952]  What happened to Carl Quintero?
[02:20:42.352 --> 02:20:43.452]  What happened to Guzman?
[02:20:43.532 --> 02:20:51.296]  He was arrested one time and he got out and went back and now he's arrested again and all this was around at the time.
[02:20:51.336 --> 02:21:01.281]  The first one was around the Mexican elections and then also the Fast and Furious situation was also around one of our elections and it was tampered with and it was put on ice.
[02:21:01.721 --> 02:21:04.602]  Sure, I understand it's all compartmentalization.
[02:21:04.622 --> 02:21:08.024]  They keep good people from rising up, you know, anywhere above kernel.
[02:21:08.064 --> 02:21:10.004]  But let's expand on that.
[02:21:27.327 --> 02:21:34.710]  What percentage of people would you say, dead reckoning, in the federal government versus local are awake to what's going on?
[02:21:34.730 --> 02:21:37.531]  I know a lot of folks wake up and actually go, oh, I better join the dark side.
[02:21:37.551 --> 02:21:39.372]  I better, you know, beg to be Darth Vader.
[02:21:40.192 --> 02:21:42.533]  And then they get screwed over so much by the system itself.
[02:21:42.553 --> 02:21:43.234]  It's just so...
[02:21:44.194 --> 02:21:49.138]  It's gotten so destructive, so evil, so dishonorable, they even screw their own people now.
[02:21:49.498 --> 02:21:52.300]  And studying stuff 50 years ago, they didn't do that as much back then.
[02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:57.063]  They seem to be getting nastier, but also stupider, more aggressive, more reckless.
[02:21:59.138 --> 02:22:17.065]  People in government today are basically more concerned about their pensions and their careers than they are concerned about getting to the truth of a matter, exposing those that are working for their own private gains, exposing campaign contributions, of which that is why these questions aren't asked.
[02:22:17.705 --> 02:22:20.006]  Why don't they ask the 11 Benghazi questions?
[02:22:20.066 --> 02:22:25.128]  Because if they ask Hillary Clinton and the State Department and John Kerry those questions,
[02:22:25.928 --> 02:22:32.449]  Then that will open up a can of worms like we've never seen before, and it will drift out into every segment of our government.
[02:22:32.809 --> 02:22:33.110]  I agree.
[02:22:33.150 --> 02:22:35.670]  So is there more of an awakening suddenly happening?
[02:22:35.690 --> 02:22:37.010]  Because we know government's been rotting.
[02:22:37.090 --> 02:22:39.691]  Is it starting to get a little bit better, or is it getting worse?
[02:22:40.271 --> 02:22:44.012]  Alex, this has been a coup d'etat on American people going on for the last 50 years.
[02:22:44.092 --> 02:22:49.313]  I run guns under Cuba for Fidel Castro at the same time we were supporting Batista.
[02:22:49.773 --> 02:23:04.337]  In other words, Castro was fighting against Batista on our own American tanks, our own M1 rifles, and anything else that was high-impact weapons that was given to Batista, and at the same time, we were giving Castro arms out of Southern Florida.
[02:23:04.637 --> 02:23:08.077]  That was in 1957, two years before Castro came into power.
[02:23:08.457 --> 02:23:10.238]  I was one of the pilots that flew the guns in there.
[02:23:10.778 --> 02:23:18.923]  I come all the way up on the same type program, tweaked a little bit, modified, and put out and came out to be known as the Iran-Contra Affair.
[02:23:19.523 --> 02:23:26.767]  I flew C-130s into Israel with TOW missiles on board before the great, great October surprise.
[02:23:27.188 --> 02:23:29.909]  There's a hell of a lineage here, but it's blocked.
[02:23:30.289 --> 02:23:31.690]  It's blocked by gatekeepers.
[02:23:33.711 --> 02:23:35.813]  I've been labeled as a conspiracy freak.
[02:23:36.413 --> 02:23:38.275]  I've been labeled as a JFK nut.
[02:23:38.935 --> 02:23:41.076]  In other words, I've been a character assassinated.
[02:23:41.096 --> 02:23:47.601]  Well, I mean, that's what McCain says about you because he knows you blew all those operations open inside Congress, but they know the public.
[02:23:47.621 --> 02:23:52.524]  Listen, we played a clip of the Democrat senator from Connecticut
[02:23:53.507 --> 02:24:02.511]  Saying that military martial law bill is being passed to let the president do whatever he wants in America, anywhere in the world, anytime in the ISIS authorization.
[02:24:02.991 --> 02:24:03.932]  It's unprecedented.
[02:24:04.432 --> 02:24:06.313]  Ron Paul calls it the biggest power grab ever.
[02:24:06.613 --> 02:24:08.934]  He calls it military martial law worldwide.
[02:24:09.754 --> 02:24:20.222]  No media will cover it up and they got a troll operation going saying that's not a real video and the senator didn't say it when it's on C-SPAN and on record and you can read the bill.
[02:24:20.602 --> 02:24:28.008]  I mean, they've gone to a new level of disinfo where they'll go out at high noon on a bright blue day and say there's no sun in the sky.
[02:24:29.110 --> 02:24:30.590]  Well, that's all part of the program.
[02:24:30.630 --> 02:24:32.511]  The old Mockingbird program, something like that.
[02:24:32.551 --> 02:24:35.591]  Desensitize a situation and win the battle.
[02:24:35.631 --> 02:24:36.751]  Control the communications.
[02:24:36.791 --> 02:24:38.432]  Do the illusionary warfare training.
[02:24:38.912 --> 02:24:40.432]  Set up all kinds of deals.
[02:24:40.492 --> 02:24:47.253]  And then put strategic people in position in order to monitor to make sure the people that want to do their job don't get out of line.
[02:24:47.293 --> 02:24:48.994]  If they get out of line, they lose their pensions.
[02:24:49.494 --> 02:24:52.614]  If they get out of line, they have charges brought against them.
[02:24:52.994 --> 02:24:56.515]  If they run for an office, then they get a character assassinated.
[02:24:57.175 --> 02:25:04.260]  Uh, it's all a question in those days what someone did with their peepee to determine whether they're going to be a president or not be a president.
[02:25:04.780 --> 02:25:06.041]  Oh, he did something wrong.
[02:25:06.241 --> 02:25:07.182]  Oh, that kind of stuff.
[02:25:07.242 --> 02:25:14.927]  Oh yeah, they always go after sex or a crooked toenail or something, uh, because they can't go after any real corruption because that feeds into everybody else.
[02:25:15.711 --> 02:25:16.151]  That's right.
[02:25:16.672 --> 02:25:20.895]  So, getting back to, okay, let's get back, because we can go off in theory here so I can.
[02:25:20.955 --> 02:25:24.637]  As you know, Alex, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, and I'm not saying you are either.
[02:25:24.697 --> 02:25:30.741]  I mean, you're doing a fantastic job, as far as I'm concerned, of trying to get factual things out to the American people.
[02:25:30.761 --> 02:25:31.322]  Thank you, sir.
[02:25:31.762 --> 02:25:36.886]  What the American people do with the factual things that you bring out and other, quote, whistleblowers bring out,
[02:25:37.446 --> 02:25:38.867]  We're not responsible for it.
[02:25:39.147 --> 02:25:48.771]  All we can do is be journalists and investigative reporters and bring the facts to the American people and let those American people decide what they're going to do about it.
[02:25:49.192 --> 02:25:49.392]  Sure.
[02:25:49.432 --> 02:25:54.674]  Now we happen to be in the day and age now where the American people don't have time to listen to the whistleblowers.
[02:25:54.994 --> 02:26:01.958]  They don't have time to get out here and study because they're too damn busy making a living and paying the bills and paying the freight to keep their families safe.
[02:26:02.618 --> 02:26:02.758]  So.
[02:26:03.038 --> 02:26:07.481]  We are beginning, if not already, a failed state.
[02:26:08.021 --> 02:26:09.762]  Our political system is in shambles.
[02:26:10.242 --> 02:26:11.703]  We're failing as a country.
[02:26:12.384 --> 02:26:15.045]  In other words, we have no respect abroad and stuff like that.
[02:26:15.085 --> 02:26:16.726]  Now, okay, now I'm getting on a soapbox.
[02:26:17.167 --> 02:26:20.729]  I'm gonna come off that soapbox, get right back down, let's go to Benghazi.
[02:26:21.895 --> 02:26:33.347]  I asked on your program years ago, please come forward with me, you operatives out there, and come forward and tell your story to the American people.
[02:26:34.008 --> 02:26:36.711]  This was before the movie 13 Hours.
[02:26:37.371 --> 02:26:42.036]  Those brave men finally did come and had the opportunity.
[02:26:42.757 --> 02:26:44.018]  And they made a fine movie.
[02:26:44.098 --> 02:26:46.220]  I haven't seen the movie and I doubt if I will see it.
[02:26:46.481 --> 02:26:47.141]  Absolutely.
[02:26:47.282 --> 02:26:54.669]  And the Navy SEALs that survived went on Megyn Kelly, which shows again they should do like Trump did and come here.
[02:26:54.689 --> 02:27:00.174]  They need to stop validating Fox to help cover it up the whole time, along with CNN and everybody else.
[02:27:00.554 --> 02:27:02.156]  And I'm not in competition with Fox.
[02:27:02.236 --> 02:27:03.697]  I'm just sick and tired.
[02:27:04.838 --> 02:27:08.079]  of people thinking the mainstream media still has any power.
[02:27:09.639 --> 02:27:33.445]  The only power it has now is to basically follow what real journalists are putting out and reporting on, but now they've come out and said Hillary's a liar, they heard the stand down with their own ears, and they need to be protected and defended, and people need to start getting punished at the top of this government, or there is no bottom to it, and as you said, we will be a completely failed state like North Korea or Mexico, and we are headed that
[02:27:34.065 --> 02:27:34.945]  Way fast.
[02:27:35.285 --> 02:27:37.126]  Tosh Plumlee, thank you so much.
[02:27:37.166 --> 02:27:41.188]  Facebook.com forward slash RobertDoshPlumlee.5.
[02:27:41.888 --> 02:27:43.749]  It's linked up on Infowars.com.
[02:27:43.989 --> 02:27:44.669]  We're going to tweet it out.
[02:27:44.689 --> 02:27:46.210]  I already did on Twitter.
[02:27:46.490 --> 02:27:48.150]  And sir, let's get you back up a lot sooner.
[02:27:48.390 --> 02:27:49.671]  We salute you and God bless you.
[02:27:50.342 --> 02:27:52.964]  Okay, thank you, Alex, and I appreciate the comments there.
[02:27:52.984 --> 02:27:53.224]  Thank you.
[02:27:53.264 --> 02:27:53.784]  Thank you, sir.
[02:27:53.824 --> 02:27:55.105]  Wow, what an amazing person.
[02:27:55.145 --> 02:28:01.768]  I mean, that guy's on record in congressional hearings, all certified, you know, flying guns directly to Fidel Castro under Eisenhower's orders.
[02:28:02.469 --> 02:28:07.312]  When they called him the Abraham Lincoln of the Caribbean, I'm not bashing Eisenhower, you know, but that's what was happening back then.
[02:28:08.252 --> 02:28:16.677]  And then just Iran-Contra and the tow missiles for the whole situation to Iran and just, I mean, he's been there.
[02:28:17.816 --> 02:28:22.060]  And he's been validated and vindicated so he still had his job until right after Benghazi when he retired.
[02:28:23.141 --> 02:28:25.043]  And came on the show to break it all down.
[02:28:25.303 --> 02:28:29.347]  We're going to go to break and come back briefly with Joel Skousen for the situation in Oregon.
[02:28:29.367 --> 02:28:32.791]  Look, they're going to try to turn it into a new Waco.
[02:28:33.291 --> 02:28:34.492]  They've killed him on the street.
[02:28:35.470 --> 02:28:45.677]  Shot one of the other Bundys and now they've got so-called militia people, whether they got angry or whether they're provocateurs running around saying, you know, it's Armageddon, get ready, we're gonna fight to the death.
[02:28:46.217 --> 02:28:49.299]  This is perfect timing for Obama to come after the guns.
[02:28:49.839 --> 02:28:53.642]  Perfect timing for there to be a new Oklahoma City and blame the Second Amendment.
[02:28:55.195 --> 02:28:56.497]  We told you it was the season of that.
[02:28:56.837 --> 02:28:58.219]  We told you exactly what happened.
[02:28:58.859 --> 02:29:04.726]  But you got the provocateurs telling them, don't listen to Joel Scouser and Alex Jones and Tosh Plumlee, the famous CIA operative.
[02:29:05.147 --> 02:29:06.148]  They don't know anything.
[02:29:06.588 --> 02:29:07.009]  No!
[02:29:07.169 --> 02:29:09.431]  We're going to have the war with the Feds!
[02:29:09.471 --> 02:29:10.032]  This is it!
[02:29:10.513 --> 02:29:13.636]  I mean, folks, I told you the Atari were run by Feds.
[02:29:13.696 --> 02:29:14.737]  It came out six months later.
[02:29:15.598 --> 02:29:18.339]  I told you over and over again, it's an M.O.
[02:29:18.919 --> 02:29:20.979]  It's like, how do you know there's a new Coke commercial?
[02:29:20.999 --> 02:29:22.180]  Because it's a commercial!
[02:29:22.760 --> 02:29:23.760]  It's a handbook!
[02:29:24.140 --> 02:29:26.240]  You'd have to be a moron not to see it!
[02:29:27.721 --> 02:29:28.881]  The Bundys had good hearts.
[02:29:30.301 --> 02:29:41.064]  A great historical thing happened in Nevada, but the enemy then set them up, lured them in, let them in, got them all hyped up.
[02:29:42.248 --> 02:29:46.470]  And now they want to have a Waco in there and demonize it.
[02:29:46.510 --> 02:29:48.431]  And the media says it's white Al Qaeda.
[02:29:48.471 --> 02:29:52.473]  It's y'all Qaeda to kick off homeland security against the gun owners.
[02:29:53.134 --> 02:29:53.574]  Wow!
[02:29:53.674 --> 02:29:56.175]  What great strategy from the Bundys!
[02:29:58.136 --> 02:29:59.037]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.537 --> 02:30:01.138]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.058 --> 02:30:04.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:08.766 --> 02:30:18.048]  During a news conference before addressing a large crowd in Iowa, Donald Trump expressed irritation that Fox News planned to leave Megyn Kelly as moderator of the Thursday night GOP debate.
[02:30:18.348 --> 02:30:20.928]  Megyn Kelly's really biased against me.
[02:30:21.308 --> 02:30:21.869]  I know that.
[02:30:22.109 --> 02:30:23.049]  Everybody knows that.
[02:30:23.309 --> 02:30:25.629]  Do you really think she can be fair at a debate?
[02:30:25.709 --> 02:30:29.590]  To which Fox News replied that he doesn't get to pick the journalists.
[02:30:29.910 --> 02:30:32.611]  They can't toy with me like they toy with everybody else.
[02:30:32.971 --> 02:30:33.891]  I won't be doing the debate.
[02:30:34.568 --> 02:30:35.189]  A smart move.
[02:30:35.629 --> 02:30:44.760]  After Rand Paul was arbitrarily excluded by Fox Business, Paul held his own event on social media as the debate was occurring and he trended number one on Twitter.
[02:30:45.040 --> 02:30:49.866]  Donald Trump now plans on holding a live event simultaneously with the debate on Thursday night.
[02:30:50.206 --> 02:30:58.356]  InfoWars reporters will be live at the Trump event in Iowa as part of our live debate coverage of the last debate before the first votes are cast on Monday.
[02:30:58.776 --> 02:31:04.763]  Join us for live analysis and coverage of both events beginning Thursday at 7 central, 8 p.m.

[02:31:46.873 --> 02:31:50.016]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.

[02:31:53.659 --> 02:31:55.340]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:31:55.640 --> 02:31:56.521]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:31:56.541 --> 02:31:57.482]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:31:57.742 --> 02:31:59.584]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[02:33:23.018 --> 02:33:29.360]  You are a programmable guy that goes and watches Olympus is Falling and believes all this and really thinks you're a hero.
[02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:30.220]  G.I.
[02:33:30.260 --> 02:33:32.281]  Joe, great American hero.
[02:33:32.561 --> 02:33:33.361]  Joe, Joe.
[02:33:33.742 --> 02:33:34.962]  You don't work for Joe.
[02:33:35.182 --> 02:33:36.342]  Joe got taken over.
[02:33:37.223 --> 02:33:37.743]  The G.I.
[02:33:37.783 --> 02:33:40.364]  Joe command base is run by Cobra.
[02:33:41.124 --> 02:33:42.005]  Do you understand that?
[02:33:42.385 --> 02:33:47.408]  And I use a child analogy to get through to you because that's your main programming template in North America.
[02:33:47.568 --> 02:33:48.508]  They're on record with that.
[02:33:48.928 --> 02:33:50.309]  That was all Pentagon directed.
[02:33:50.329 --> 02:33:51.430]  Do you understand?
[02:33:51.470 --> 02:33:52.611]  You work for Cobra.
[02:33:52.851 --> 02:33:54.131]  You dress like Cobra.
[02:33:54.311 --> 02:33:55.732]  You have the tactics of Cobra.
[02:33:55.992 --> 02:33:57.113]  You are Cobra.
[02:33:57.253 --> 02:33:58.234]  Hail Cobra!
[02:33:59.174 --> 02:34:00.234]  You want to be little boys?
[02:34:00.254 --> 02:34:02.675]  Or do you want to really join the Republic?
[02:34:03.175 --> 02:34:08.077]  They know what's going on at the Bundy Ranch, and they won't even let a police information officer give us any information.
[02:34:08.297 --> 02:34:09.057]  That's a bunch of bull****.
[02:34:09.537 --> 02:34:10.878]  It's all these stupid G.I.
[02:34:10.938 --> 02:34:13.598]  Joe movies and stuff, where the White House is attacked.
[02:34:13.818 --> 02:34:15.539]  The White House is run by Cobra!
[02:34:16.059 --> 02:34:23.881]  When I went through the process of becoming Press Secretary, one of the first things they told me was, you're not even to acknowledge the drone program.
[02:34:24.141 --> 02:34:26.502]  You're not even to discuss that it exists.
[02:34:27.082 --> 02:34:28.262]  It's run by chaos!
[02:34:28.702 --> 02:34:29.863]  It's run by Spectre!
[02:34:30.583 --> 02:34:35.184]  Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, Extortion.
[02:34:36.050 --> 02:34:37.051]  They run little kids.
[02:34:37.092 --> 02:34:38.153]  They run the snuff films.
[02:34:38.333 --> 02:34:39.114]  They run the drugs.
[02:34:39.134 --> 02:34:39.715]  They run it all.
[02:34:39.855 --> 02:34:44.521]  And because you act like a bunch of naive chumps, this whole thing's gonna come down on us!
[02:34:44.882 --> 02:34:50.630]  Very much concerns me, considering that they have all this bulk ammunition that they're shooting targets of children.
[02:34:51.150 --> 02:34:53.272]  Would you like to tell me who it is that is doing this?
[02:34:53.773 --> 02:34:55.634]  It is the Department of Homeland Security, sir.
[02:34:56.315 --> 02:34:58.257]  Oh, thank you for calling.
[02:34:58.297 --> 02:35:03.982]  To every police officer in this country, to every FBI agent, to every Secret Service agent, you work for Spectre.
[02:35:04.422 --> 02:35:05.503]  You work for Kaos.
[02:35:05.743 --> 02:35:10.748]  You work for Cobra.
[02:35:10.808 --> 02:35:11.689]  How do they get power?
[02:35:11.849 --> 02:35:16.273]  They stage a terror attack using Spectre, using Cobra.
[02:35:20.580 --> 02:35:21.280]  Go f*** yourself.
[02:35:21.801 --> 02:35:22.421]  Who is COBRA?
[02:35:22.581 --> 02:35:26.082]  Arms dealing, drug dealing, money laundering group, wearing masks.
[02:35:26.402 --> 02:35:30.324]  They wear masks, ladies and gentlemen, because they're the corporate CEOs.
[02:35:30.944 --> 02:35:33.205]  And they're manipulating the governments against each other.
[02:35:33.706 --> 02:35:35.006]  COBRA runs the Muslims.
[02:35:35.246 --> 02:35:36.807]  COBRA runs the CIA.
[02:35:37.067 --> 02:35:38.248]  COBRA runs it all.
[02:35:38.488 --> 02:35:39.488]  COBRA is real.
[02:35:39.948 --> 02:35:41.469]  You can call it whatever you want.
[02:35:42.765 --> 02:35:44.587]  Cobra is in control of America.
[02:35:44.867 --> 02:35:50.733]  And Cobra says the veterans and the gun owners, they're saying that we're the bad guys.
[02:35:50.873 --> 02:35:55.698]  These people who hold themselves down to be patriots are not.
[02:35:56.259 --> 02:35:58.401]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[02:35:58.741 --> 02:36:00.143]  That's what Cobra would say.
[02:36:00.383 --> 02:36:01.764]  That's what Specter would say.
[02:36:02.125 --> 02:36:03.666]  That's what Goldfinger would say.
[02:36:03.907 --> 02:36:05.909]  Because that's who those people are.
[02:36:06.589 --> 02:36:10.551]  I am Supreme Cobra Commander!
[02:36:11.191 --> 02:36:16.032]  You call your petty bureaucrats officials and authorities?
[02:36:16.533 --> 02:36:20.454]  You will kneel before Cobra of faith!
[02:36:22.702 --> 02:36:26.264]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:36:26.804 --> 02:36:28.645]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:36:29.325 --> 02:36:32.167]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Cobra Leader.
[02:36:32.387 --> 02:36:34.448]  You pathetic little worm!
[02:36:34.608 --> 02:36:37.309]  How dare you call me Mr. Cobra!
[02:36:42.617 --> 02:36:45.278]  Carrie Jackson put that amazing piece together a few years ago.
[02:36:45.298 --> 02:36:53.880]  In the new James Bond movie, which is approved by MI6 on record, Ian Fleming, high-level MI6, of course, OSS, before that, wrote those novels.
[02:36:54.461 --> 02:37:01.783]  But in the new one, the Quantum Group is actually the corporation over Spectre, and the character is a George Soros character.
[02:37:02.523 --> 02:37:05.084]  Who tried to crash the British Pound, of course, famously.
[02:37:05.104 --> 02:37:10.365]  I mean, he literally is one of the main leaders of Spectre, along with Brzezinski and others.
[02:37:11.146 --> 02:37:15.287]  And their symbol, I've talked to folks that were high-level CIA.
[02:37:15.907 --> 02:37:21.229]  And they said, you know, the group that runs it all, and I was told this 20 years ago, we call it Hydra.
[02:37:22.129 --> 02:37:24.890]  And it's basically an octopus.
[02:37:26.250 --> 02:37:28.451]  And then you notice that's what it is with Spectre.
[02:37:28.911 --> 02:37:30.292]  I mean, it's real, folks.
[02:37:31.052 --> 02:37:31.452]  It's real.
[02:37:33.154 --> 02:37:42.842]  And it's just all in your face, just like the new X-Files they admit is mainly based on myself and my research material integrated with a bunch of made-up alien stuff, because they just revelation of the method.
[02:37:42.882 --> 02:37:44.643]  They just go, oh look, it's entertainment!
[02:37:45.244 --> 02:37:46.445]  And it all becomes a big joke.
[02:37:47.866 --> 02:37:50.908]  We're gonna go to Joel Skousen here, I appreciate coming on on short notice, just briefly.
[02:37:50.928 --> 02:37:52.930]  I'm gonna send reporters out there.
[02:37:53.731 --> 02:37:55.052]  So pray for them, support us.
[02:37:56.291 --> 02:37:57.732]  This could turn into a new Waco.
[02:37:57.952 --> 02:38:02.356]  I want to talk to a really smart guy, Joel Skousen, to see what he thinks we can do to try to stop this.
[02:38:03.016 --> 02:38:05.098]  Tosh Plumlee's trying to talk to the folks inside.
[02:38:05.118 --> 02:38:08.500]  That's a famous CIA contractor and black ops guy.
[02:38:09.281 --> 02:38:10.322]  I mean, super famous.
[02:38:10.502 --> 02:38:13.244]  Probably nobody's got more flights under their belt than he does.
[02:38:14.105 --> 02:38:16.466]  And he's been talking to him for 21 days saying, you're being set up.
[02:38:16.707 --> 02:38:17.527]  It's all artificial.
[02:38:17.567 --> 02:38:17.947]  Get out.
[02:38:18.508 --> 02:38:19.889]  Who is in control of your communications?
[02:38:19.929 --> 02:38:20.670]  That's who you gotta watch.
[02:38:21.050 --> 02:38:22.171]  I mean, it's just...
[02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:25.171]  He's like, get out of there, get out of there, get out of there.
[02:38:25.191 --> 02:38:28.293]  They just can't listen, because they're like, you're a man of the Lord.
[02:38:28.334 --> 02:38:29.614]  You're not going to leave, are you, Mr. Bunny?
[02:38:29.995 --> 02:38:30.335]  I'm not.
[02:38:30.355 --> 02:38:30.975]  It's for the Lord.
[02:38:30.995 --> 02:38:32.697]  You're going to be persecuted.
[02:38:32.977 --> 02:38:33.777]  It's going to be bad.
[02:38:33.797 --> 02:38:36.559]  But you're going to have to stay, no matter what they say.
[02:38:36.860 --> 02:38:38.021]  All right, you're right, you're right.
[02:38:38.841 --> 02:38:41.803]  And so they're good men being deceived.
[02:38:44.025 --> 02:38:44.565]  Pray for them.
[02:38:44.685 --> 02:38:46.046]  I just hope this isn't a new Waco.
[02:38:46.086 --> 02:38:47.808]  I just wish the patriots would listen to me.
[02:38:48.823 --> 02:38:50.004]  I've never steered you wrong.
[02:38:51.064 --> 02:38:52.425]  We've been up here trying to help people.
[02:38:52.625 --> 02:38:55.186]  I'm in this just like you are.
[02:38:56.346 --> 02:39:02.469]  And there are good people, but you've got to learn how the enemy operates.
[02:39:02.489 --> 02:39:03.570]  We're going to talk to Joel in a moment.
[02:39:04.830 --> 02:39:05.931]  Editor of World Affairs Brief.
[02:39:08.832 --> 02:39:12.635]  But first, DNA Force is a true nutraceutical.
[02:39:13.155 --> 02:39:17.278]  Several of the compounds, like Bio-PQQ, are prescription in many countries.
[02:39:17.958 --> 02:39:24.283]  We had to go through a medical system with a medical doctor to even do the contract three years ago as we buy it every few months.
[02:39:24.883 --> 02:39:29.767]  Just one of the ingredients, the Bio-PQQ, that is true organic, not the synthetic that's still $45-50 a bottle.
[02:39:31.568 --> 02:39:37.697]  It costs us upwards of $40, sometimes more, just for the BioPQQ that goes in our formulation.
[02:39:38.298 --> 02:39:43.044]  That we can actually tell you about the 175 clinical studies that are linked at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:39:43.705 --> 02:39:47.871]  We can actually tell you what CoQ10, this particular organic type, does and the nine
[02:39:49.207 --> 02:39:52.870]  Other powerful ingredients that synergistically work with it.
[02:39:53.310 --> 02:40:04.118]  Just try a bottle of it and see what it does for areas where you've got loss of feeling, nerve damage, cartilage, cells, mitochondrial problems.
[02:40:04.778 --> 02:40:06.079]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:07.801]  It's simply amazing.
[02:40:07.821 --> 02:40:09.902]  We have a limited amount of it, but we're going to sell out of it.
[02:40:09.922 --> 02:40:10.703]  We put a new order in.
[02:40:10.863 --> 02:40:12.204]  It should get more than four or five weeks.
[02:40:13.085 --> 02:40:13.905]  It is 25% off right now.
[02:40:17.452 --> 02:40:18.554]  And it's our flagship product.
[02:40:18.574 --> 02:40:21.057]  We've got some products that are $9.95 and are super high quality.
[02:40:21.357 --> 02:40:22.138]  This is normally $139 discounted.
[02:40:22.158 --> 02:40:24.321]  It's $97 right now and upwards of $80 of product in each bottle.
[02:40:24.341 --> 02:40:25.403]  Think about that.
[02:40:32.506 --> 02:40:39.912]  Just the BioPQQ is $12,000 to $14,000 a kilo from the Japanese who make it right here in America.
[02:40:40.312 --> 02:40:42.794]  In Japan, they've been obsessed with it for 20 years.
[02:40:43.735 --> 02:40:46.156]  And of course, they're the longest-lived people there are for a lot of other reasons.
[02:40:46.196 --> 02:40:48.979]  The point is, DNA force is hardcore.
[02:40:49.419 --> 02:40:54.303]  Just the BioPQQ has the equivalent vitamin C delivery in the body.
[02:40:54.703 --> 02:40:56.064]  It's different, but it's basically the same.
[02:40:56.724 --> 02:41:00.768]  Read the science of 300 pounds of blueberries.
[02:41:01.690 --> 02:41:05.533]  You can't take, you know, 20 capels of vitamin C, like Linus Pauling said, and not get diarrhea.
[02:41:05.833 --> 02:41:07.655]  You can't really overdose on it, but it can make you sick.
[02:41:08.495 --> 02:41:09.336]  BioPQQ, one pill!
[02:41:13.233 --> 02:41:15.494]  300 pounds of blueberries.
[02:41:16.575 --> 02:41:18.236]  It's wild.
[02:41:18.596 --> 02:41:19.757]  And this is what the elite take.
[02:41:20.257 --> 02:41:24.099]  I remember about five years ago, my dad was going to medical doctors.
[02:41:24.159 --> 02:41:24.980]  He was going to people.
[02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:30.884]  He'd done some stuff at the Pentagon trying to get things fast-tracked, nutraceuticals, separately from working with me now.
[02:41:31.724 --> 02:41:33.505]  And he said, this is what you need to do.
[02:41:33.585 --> 02:41:35.567]  He goes, they're going to try to ban this here in the U.S.
[02:41:36.567 --> 02:41:37.368]  I don't know.
[02:41:50.256 --> 02:41:56.501]  So, InfoWarsLife.com, and we are discounting that massively right now because it's a major loss leader.
[02:41:56.621 --> 02:42:00.244]  We've got free shipping on orders over $50, and it helps fund our operation.
[02:42:00.525 --> 02:42:07.310]  And we just, you know, thank God for all the blessings of being able to develop such amazing products and be able to fund our operation to be independent.
[02:42:07.671 --> 02:42:14.637]  All right, going now to Joel Skousen, a former Marine Corps officer of
[02:42:15.734 --> 02:42:24.262]  Nabel, aviator from Vietnam era, of course, best-selling author, researcher, one of the preeminent experts in the world on secure homes, on strategic relocation.
[02:42:24.282 --> 02:42:29.147]  I made a film with him, and he has a big book available at InfoWarsStore.com that breaks all that down.
[02:42:30.268 --> 02:42:32.129]  And of course, his uncle was Cleon Skousen.
[02:42:33.280 --> 02:42:40.426]  Who wrote The Naked Communist and started a lot of the libertarian constitutional movement you see by understanding my ultra-rich were funding communism.
[02:42:41.447 --> 02:42:42.588]  And so he joins us now.
[02:42:43.389 --> 02:42:45.130]  I don't like saying see, I told you so.
[02:42:45.550 --> 02:42:52.736]  I got a sick feeling when I got a call last night from Joe Biggs at about 7, 38 o'clock that they had just shot and killed one of them and were calling it a shootout.
[02:42:53.177 --> 02:42:54.778]  I had a suspicion it wasn't a shootout.
[02:42:54.838 --> 02:42:56.940]  The media ran the headlines it was a shootout even today.
[02:42:57.300 --> 02:42:58.902]  Oregon standoff, militiamen killed.
[02:42:59.602 --> 02:43:08.127]  And now we can put up the new headlines with militiamen on video cameras with guns screaming angrily, you know, it's a bloodbath, an armageddon, we're gonna get you.
[02:43:08.307 --> 02:43:10.508]  I mean, you couldn't script it worse.
[02:43:11.128 --> 02:43:16.411]  To start a civil war, to start a war on patriots, Obama rolling out against the guns.
[02:43:16.531 --> 02:43:20.914]  I mean, if Obama prays in his little pillow at night, this is what he's praying for.
[02:43:21.454 --> 02:43:29.299]  And if this is successful, they'll then have attacks on federal buildings, provocateur or staged, to really go to the next phase of oppression.
[02:43:29.519 --> 02:43:30.099]  That's my view.
[02:43:30.139 --> 02:43:31.560]  We'll see what Joel Skousen says.
[02:43:31.901 --> 02:43:33.381]  He had a great plan for him to leave.
[02:43:33.602 --> 02:43:39.825]  The sheriff pretty much took our plan that we sussed out and came to them two days later and said, this is what you should do.
[02:43:41.286 --> 02:43:42.507]  And then that all changed.
[02:43:42.867 --> 02:43:44.368]  So this is now a disaster.
[02:43:45.209 --> 02:43:47.530]  Joel Skousen, do you concur with what I'm saying?
[02:43:47.570 --> 02:43:48.471]  What can you add to it?
[02:43:48.791 --> 02:43:50.172]  What you warned of is now unfolding.
[02:43:51.547 --> 02:43:53.789]  Well, it certainly has, Alex.
[02:43:54.290 --> 02:43:58.054]  I predicted that this wouldn't end well and would end in, you know, a federal shootout.
[02:43:58.434 --> 02:44:10.046]  What is interesting to me, though, is how the feds allowed them, I think they lured them out of the refuge or, you know, Bundy and his group may have showed up at the community meeting last week
[02:44:10.746 --> 02:44:13.932]  Uh, unannounced and may have cut the feds off by surprise.
[02:44:13.972 --> 02:44:24.689]  But, you know, to to be in a standoff situation, though there was no direct armed confrontation, they were still armed and they were, you know, claiming to defend that refuge and then to drive out of there.
[02:44:25.771 --> 02:44:28.713]  And expect not to be arrested was kind of interesting.
[02:44:29.233 --> 02:44:39.418]  The fact that they got away with it the first time allowed them to take on this meeting in John Day with this other public meeting and to address their cause.
[02:44:39.498 --> 02:44:44.101]  And obviously the feds had set them up so that they ambushed them on the way out there.
[02:44:44.501 --> 02:44:47.683]  They pulled them over, as you've reported, you know, in a car.
[02:44:47.723 --> 02:44:49.164]  And what is really interesting
[02:44:49.844 --> 02:44:50.044]  Yes.
[02:45:05.070 --> 02:45:08.291]  Uh, and tried to evade the shooting, uh, end up crashing.
[02:45:08.811 --> 02:45:11.451]  And then with hands out of the car, they were being shot at again.
[02:45:11.511 --> 02:45:18.993]  So, you know, Finnicum, who's a very mild-mannered, grandfatherly type, well-spoken, um, Mormon.
[02:45:19.073 --> 02:45:20.794]  He's a good religious man.
[02:45:20.814 --> 02:45:24.114]  Uh, it's a shame that he's the one that got shot.
[02:45:24.214 --> 02:45:26.695]  I mean, this guy was taking the higher ground.
[02:45:26.735 --> 02:45:26.795]  He
[02:45:27.984 --> 02:45:33.109]  Uh, you know, there's conflicting reports about what happened when he got out of the car, but clearly he was not armed.
[02:45:33.149 --> 02:45:34.250]  His hands were in the air.
[02:45:34.910 --> 02:45:36.872]  And it's true that he may have been fed up.
[02:45:37.232 --> 02:45:43.638]  You know, one of the witnesses talking to Bundy's bodyguard said that he rushed the officers, but I don't think that's really what happened.
[02:45:43.678 --> 02:45:47.441]  What I think was in his anger saying, look, if you're going to kill me, then go ahead and shoot.
[02:45:47.461 --> 02:45:49.403]  And he was, you know, walking forward to them.
[02:45:50.373 --> 02:45:52.535]  Basically, bearing his chest to them with his hands.
[02:45:53.055 --> 02:45:59.820]  But there's no justification for the police, the FBI, or whoever it was, to shoot him in the head when his hands are in the air.
[02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:02.061]  I don't care if you're walking towards him or... Absolutely.
[02:46:02.121 --> 02:46:17.112]  So, it's going towards murder, leaning towards the fact that the feds have decided to try to provocateur something, because they were able, successfully, because of plants, I think, Joel, to demonize the land rights movement there.
[02:46:18.715 --> 02:46:22.438]  Well, it's clear that they didn't want to Waco in the sense of a siege.
[02:46:22.758 --> 02:46:26.781]  They could have besieged that refuge weeks earlier.
[02:46:27.121 --> 02:46:31.205]  They could have cut off all contact and they could have cut off any food supplies, but they didn't.
[02:46:32.185 --> 02:46:38.730]  I think what they really wanted to do is to portray that this was a shootout with the militia, which it was not a shootout.
[02:46:39.651 --> 02:46:43.074]  There was no guns fired from the car whatsoever.
[02:46:43.094 --> 02:46:47.057]  There was no guns raised to defend themselves, only hands out the window.
[02:46:47.718 --> 02:46:52.009]  And what's interesting here is that there are now six witnesses to this murder.
[02:46:53.064 --> 02:47:01.165]  And although there are going to be defendants in their own trials and things, we have six credible witnesses that he was shot with his hands up.
[02:47:01.806 --> 02:47:05.126]  The governor should order the state police to release their squad car videos.
[02:47:05.146 --> 02:47:06.406]  I don't expect the feds to.
[02:47:06.787 --> 02:47:11.467]  But if they don't instantly release these, it shows the six witnesses are telling the truth.
[02:47:11.967 --> 02:47:14.308]  Do you think it's a mishap by whoever shot him?
[02:47:14.468 --> 02:47:16.148]  Or do you think this is part of a larger plan?
[02:47:16.628 --> 02:47:17.989]  This is part of a larger plan.
[02:47:18.029 --> 02:47:19.089]  They had to go in there.
[02:47:20.609 --> 02:47:23.192]  Trigger-happy wanting to take these people down.
[02:47:23.572 --> 02:47:24.894]  And they did so.
[02:47:24.994 --> 02:47:32.542]  In fact, the fact that they peppered this car with bullets, with people's hands up, where they had to grasp around and find some kind of white flag.
[02:47:33.143 --> 02:47:36.967]  I mean, one way... They might have been planning to kill them all and set them up in a shootout.
[02:47:38.410 --> 02:47:44.611]  You know, clearly when you shoot that many bullets into a car, you're intending to kill everybody in the car.
[02:47:44.911 --> 02:47:46.592]  And that's simply unwarranted.
[02:47:46.692 --> 02:47:48.672]  I don't care if there's weapons in the car.
[02:47:48.732 --> 02:47:50.432]  The point is... I totally agree, Joel.
[02:47:50.452 --> 02:47:53.073]  You're a smart guy, and that's why we've got you here.
[02:47:53.453 --> 02:47:54.793]  What do you think the big picture is?
[02:47:54.833 --> 02:47:57.094]  Do you agree that they walked into a trap?
[02:47:57.414 --> 02:48:02.094]  What do we do now to get those people inside the refuge out who are running around saying they're going to fight to the end?
[02:48:02.135 --> 02:48:03.755]  I mean, this is deteriorating quickly.
[02:48:03.775 --> 02:48:04.135]  Do you agree?
[02:48:05.094 --> 02:48:07.255]  Absolutely, and it's foolish to fight to the end.
[02:48:07.275 --> 02:48:14.899]  I mean, clearly they need to defuse this situation as we have encouraged them to do from the very beginning and live to fight another day.
[02:48:15.380 --> 02:48:23.844]  What I say is you need to figure out another Hammond, someone who's being oppressed by the BLM, who's got a clear case like the Bundys had on their ranch in Nevada.
[02:48:23.884 --> 02:48:28.907]  Shouldn't they just leave now and go directly unarmed to the police department, get out and lay on the ground?
[02:48:29.147 --> 02:48:33.730]  Because I think if they've gone this far, they may kill more people that come out if they catch them out on the road somewhere.
[02:48:34.773 --> 02:48:40.015]  Well, I only disagree in the sense that I don't think that the Feds want to create another Waco there.
[02:48:40.075 --> 02:48:51.821]  They've already got a murder charge being aired about on the internet, which is enlivening these things, and that may well have been why they shot one, to see if they can't throw the militia movement into a
[02:48:54.144 --> 02:48:55.946]  You know, an armed conflict with the nation.
[02:48:55.966 --> 02:48:57.388]  I don't think it's going to go to civil war.
[02:48:57.408 --> 02:48:58.709]  I don't think it's going to get... No, I agree.
[02:48:58.729 --> 02:49:05.277]  I agree it's not going to go to civil war, but it creates the narrative for the background for in the future to persecute the patriots.
[02:49:06.263 --> 02:49:07.164]  Yes, it certainly does.
[02:49:07.584 --> 02:49:16.169]  And it makes it almost impossible now to do an Ammon Bundy-style standoff, even in defense of someone like the Hammonds.
[02:49:16.250 --> 02:49:21.933]  When you go in armed and everything, now everyone's going to be primed to say, yeah, take them down, put the feds in.
[02:49:22.313 --> 02:49:24.175]  They're going to have to cover up this murder, though.
[02:49:24.895 --> 02:49:25.775]  And I think they will.
[02:49:25.895 --> 02:49:30.097]  I think they'll sequester the dash cam videos if there were any there.
[02:49:30.557 --> 02:49:32.158]  They won't allow them to be shown.
[02:49:32.298 --> 02:49:34.318]  They'll be sealed in court testimony.
[02:49:34.439 --> 02:49:36.139]  It will be their word against mine.
[02:49:36.239 --> 02:49:39.880]  And I'll predict they're going to let the federal authorities off scot-free.
[02:49:40.141 --> 02:49:42.721]  This will enliven the movement and enrage it.
[02:49:43.722 --> 02:49:49.184]  But I clearly don't think, because Bundy lost the high ground by staying too long,
[02:49:50.784 --> 02:49:51.884]  And it ended up poorly.
[02:49:52.945 --> 02:49:59.666]  It's going to enliven a certain portion of the movement, but I was afraid that there were some agent provocateurs there within the refuge.
[02:50:00.126 --> 02:50:06.207]  They seem to know everywhere about their planned movements to set up this trap going to John Day.
[02:50:06.247 --> 02:50:09.768]  In fact, the meeting may have been organized in order to lure them out again.
[02:50:11.308 --> 02:50:13.969]  Joel Scowls, the editor of WorldAffairsBrief.com, is our guest.
[02:50:14.029 --> 02:50:15.309]  I'm Alex Jones, who just joined us.
[02:50:17.093 --> 02:50:21.358]  The whole thing stinks to high heaven, Joe, and you look at what else is happening in the world.
[02:50:21.958 --> 02:50:28.645]  I want to come back from break and talk a little bit more about this, but I also want to get into this new War Powers authorization.
[02:50:28.665 --> 02:50:34.612]  Just briefly going to break, I mean, you know, Senators calling it Worldwide Declaration of Military Martial Law.
[02:50:37.372 --> 02:50:38.653]  Yeah, it's very, very serious.
[02:50:39.233 --> 02:50:44.535]  I'm not sure it's going to become law, but it's definitely dangerous as it's written.
[02:50:45.416 --> 02:50:45.976]  Absolutely.
[02:50:46.016 --> 02:50:50.078]  I mean, it's got the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, pushing it.
[02:50:50.118 --> 02:50:51.278]  It's got a bunch of co-sponsors.
[02:50:51.338 --> 02:50:56.781]  It just shows the season we're in of rampant power grabbing.
[02:50:56.801 --> 02:51:00.743]  I also want to ask Phil Skousen, we're going to have some bam, bam, bam quick questions about Hillary Clinton.
[02:51:01.775 --> 02:51:04.559]  Rush Limbaugh's coming out saying she might kill Bernie Sanders.
[02:51:05.320 --> 02:51:06.802]  You've got all these other people coming out against her.
[02:51:06.842 --> 02:51:08.043]  Are they about to get rid of her?
[02:51:09.385 --> 02:51:12.049]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[02:51:12.129 --> 02:51:15.613]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[02:51:16.815 --> 02:51:19.976]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[02:51:20.296 --> 02:51:25.378]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[02:51:25.738 --> 02:51:26.959]  How is this even possible?
[02:51:27.219 --> 02:51:34.541]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[02:51:34.761 --> 02:51:42.184]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[02:51:42.404 --> 02:51:45.605]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[02:51:45.885 --> 02:51:53.311]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[02:51:53.711 --> 02:51:56.413]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[02:51:56.873 --> 02:52:00.936]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[02:52:00.996 --> 02:52:01.677]  That's Greens75.com.

[02:52:08.149 --> 02:52:12.772]  Wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, a crashing economy.
[02:52:12.972 --> 02:52:13.833]  Are you ready?
[02:52:14.073 --> 02:52:16.714]  At best, your local stores have a three-day supply of food.
[02:52:16.854 --> 02:52:19.016]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?
[02:52:19.196 --> 02:52:22.698]  Are you willing to gamble your family's safety that it'll never happen to you?
[02:52:22.998 --> 02:52:27.761]  Be wise and be ready with 25-Year Shelf Life Wise Food Storage.

[02:52:38.129 --> 02:52:43.373]  Just add water and your family is eating delicious food instead of fighting for scraps in a food riot.

[02:52:49.318 --> 02:52:49.698]  That's right.
[02:53:08.149 --> 02:53:14.871]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[02:53:15.231 --> 02:53:18.892]  It caught me totally by surprise, and it involves FEMA.
[02:53:19.232 --> 02:53:22.193]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[02:53:22.633 --> 02:53:27.714]  Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[02:53:28.314 --> 02:53:32.335]  Watch the viral video at FEMA3.com before it disappears again.
[02:53:32.675 --> 02:53:38.297]  But be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is, they must know something we don't.
[02:53:38.837 --> 02:53:48.860]  Go to FEMA3.com to see the number one item you should be hoarding and why supplies of this critical item are so low or even completely sold out at many stores across America.
[02:53:49.580 --> 02:53:50.461]  Don't miss out.
[02:53:50.801 --> 02:53:55.524]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in recent days.
[02:53:56.004 --> 02:54:01.247]  Go to FEMA3.com and discover the number one most critical item in a crisis.
[02:54:01.607 --> 02:54:04.909]  Watch the shocking video right now at FEMA3.com.
[02:54:05.250 --> 02:54:06.350]  Again, that's FEMA3.com.
[02:54:14.176 --> 02:54:16.699]  You can't make this up.
[02:54:16.739 --> 02:54:27.329]  The new political correct groups, the stories up on Infowars.com have come out and said Martin Luther King wasn't inclusive enough.
[02:54:27.570 --> 02:54:29.231]  He wasn't politically correct enough.
[02:54:31.974 --> 02:54:36.719]  We've also got Sweden in places saying they're going to charge people with, what is it, sedition.
[02:54:38.103 --> 02:54:50.633]  If they criticize radical Muslims, they're going to take our rights away in the name of making them feel at home and covering up statues in Rome when the Iranian religious dictator shows up.
[02:54:52.102 --> 02:54:52.863]  It's just crazy.
[02:54:53.823 --> 02:54:56.405]  And then we have all this political jockeying going along.
[02:54:56.445 --> 02:54:58.247]  Bernie Sanders being invited to the White House.
[02:54:58.267 --> 02:55:00.148]  Are they getting ready to slip him in?
[02:55:00.168 --> 02:55:03.030]  I thought it'd be Biden if they indict Hillary.
[02:55:03.731 --> 02:55:10.176]  I'm really seeing big guns come out and say bold things, as if the handcuffs have been taken off of Hillary.
[02:55:10.436 --> 02:55:17.421]  Now she's got a lot of, you know, knows where the skeletons are buried, but the word is she's not too healthy, so maybe the wolves smell blood.
[02:55:18.682 --> 02:55:19.563]  Geopolitically,
[02:55:20.967 --> 02:55:23.149]  Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief, the editor.
[02:55:23.970 --> 02:55:25.252]  What are we facing right now?
[02:55:25.272 --> 02:55:30.838]  This is a gestalt with Hillary election, Trump saying he won't be in the debate, things like that.
[02:55:32.093 --> 02:55:37.036]  Well, I think Trump, first of all, made a very wise strategic move by evading the debate.
[02:55:37.156 --> 02:55:40.038]  It wasn't really the Megyn Kelly thing that he was evading.
[02:55:40.859 --> 02:55:43.421]  It was the Muslim trap that they had set up.
[02:55:43.501 --> 02:55:54.068]  They had two or three, you know, immigrants, one Muslim, one Hispanic, ready and primed to ask him embarrassing questions to try to focus on that issue.
[02:55:54.348 --> 02:55:56.870]  And they were setting up a major trap for him.
[02:55:56.950 --> 02:55:58.851]  And now everybody will talk about him instead.
[02:55:58.911 --> 02:56:01.773]  He'll end up getting more viewers than the debate going everywhere else.
[02:56:02.473 --> 02:56:03.415]  Absolutely.
[02:56:03.695 --> 02:56:05.317]  It's always a win-win situation.
[02:56:05.357 --> 02:56:09.282]  Trump's actually showing quite a bit of political finesse despite the way he speaks.
[02:56:10.043 --> 02:56:13.487]  I'm surprised that he is able to keep them churning.
[02:56:14.808 --> 02:56:16.531]  Well, he does dumb down his speech.
[02:56:16.651 --> 02:56:17.872]  I mean, he's super smart.
[02:56:17.892 --> 02:56:20.175]  I mean, he's doing that to be more populist.
[02:56:20.596 --> 02:56:21.216]  It's surprising.
[02:56:22.082 --> 02:56:30.886]  Yeah, he did make a major error, I thought, when he talked about, yeah, I can deal with Pelosi, I can deal with Schumer, I can deal with McConnell and all these people, no problem at all.
[02:56:31.467 --> 02:56:33.688]  That's really not the kind of message that conservatives need.
[02:56:33.708 --> 02:56:35.608]  Sure, they can say that that means he's being establishment.
[02:56:36.129 --> 02:56:36.289]  Yeah.
[02:56:36.749 --> 02:56:39.310]  Now, I don't think he is controlled by the establishment.
[02:56:39.470 --> 02:56:41.811]  I mean, he just simply can't stick to a script.
[02:56:41.851 --> 02:56:43.952]  Nobody who's controlled would act that way.
[02:56:44.833 --> 02:56:48.815]  But nevertheless, it's very clear when they trot out Ben Sasse,
[02:56:49.355 --> 02:56:54.218]  The very popular Senator from Nebraska now to take on the anti-Trump movement.
[02:56:54.278 --> 02:56:58.261]  He's going from campaign to campaign in Iowa, talking down Trump.
[02:56:59.682 --> 02:57:04.465]  And even the Washington Post is talking about perhaps running him as a dark horse.
[02:57:04.485 --> 02:57:14.512]  I think the establishment is desperately looking for someone to come up and take over the lead from Trump if they can destabilize or at least neutralize most of the other candidates.
[02:57:15.032 --> 02:57:19.897]  So, you know, Jeff Renz has been touting Ben Sasse for a long time.
[02:57:20.058 --> 02:57:22.220]  I'm particularly not enthused.
[02:57:22.300 --> 02:57:33.392]  Anybody who comes out and becomes an attack dog and takes the place of Dick Cheney at a major GOP meeting in New Hampshire isn't somebody who I can trust as a conservative.
[02:57:33.712 --> 02:57:44.841]  Sure, the editor of the Financial Times of London, Bilderberg Group member at Davos, says the quote, global super elite must stop Donald Trump at all costs, and they're all doubling down with money against him.
[02:57:45.582 --> 02:57:50.166]  And the word is, Trump is really learning about the New World Order, conspiracy, everything else.
[02:57:50.206 --> 02:57:51.627]  Little Birdy's told me that, Joel.
[02:57:51.927 --> 02:57:53.849]  I mean, he's got to really watch it if he's for real.
[02:57:54.980 --> 02:57:55.920]  Yeah, he really does.
[02:57:56.961 --> 02:58:01.062]  But so far, the big story now is what to do with Hillary.
[02:58:01.102 --> 02:58:09.425]  Now, you know, I realize that you had on a guest who said that Hillary's going to threaten to, I guess it was Larry... Larry Nichols.
[02:58:09.826 --> 02:58:12.847]  Larry Nichols, yeah, who, you know, worked for the Clintons.
[02:58:12.867 --> 02:58:13.947]  He knows the Clintons well.
[02:58:14.007 --> 02:58:23.871]  But I don't think he understands really the globalist agenda, because if he thinks that anybody, even Hillary Clinton, can go and threaten those people with all the deep, dark secrets,
[02:58:24.591 --> 02:58:26.793]  And stay alive, I think he's kidding himself.
[02:58:26.913 --> 02:58:28.655]  He doesn't understand the ruthlessness.
[02:58:28.935 --> 02:58:30.536]  Stay there, we gotta go to break 70 seconds.
[02:58:30.576 --> 02:58:36.441]  I think what he's saying is, intermural in the governing minion class, this is a fight.
[02:58:36.742 --> 02:58:39.584]  But it's like, you know, the A team against the B team.
[02:58:39.624 --> 02:58:41.846]  But come back for five minutes, give us your take.
[02:58:42.086 --> 02:58:49.012]  Then Jakari Jackson's hosting the fourth hour because David Knight is deploying to Oregon and the new Waco that could be developing.
[02:58:49.313 --> 02:58:50.454]  We hope that's not the case.
[02:58:50.894 --> 02:58:56.163]  And I'll get more of Joel's take on angles he thinks we ought to report on from there because this is really a mess.
[02:58:56.263 --> 02:58:57.725]  I just want to get those people out of there.
[02:58:58.621 --> 02:59:01.803]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:59:02.124 --> 02:59:10.130]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:59:10.370 --> 02:59:15.393]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:59:15.794 --> 02:59:18.075]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:59:18.316 --> 02:59:20.097]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:59:32.960 --> 02:59:36.923]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[03:00:00.706 --> 03:00:03.291]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:23.633 --> 03:00:25.074]  We are on the march.
[03:00:25.455 --> 03:00:27.877]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:00:28.597 --> 03:00:32.341]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:34.262 --> 03:00:38.386]  Good is marching against evil, but evil is multiplying and taking over the world.
[03:00:38.506 --> 03:00:40.528]  But that's all part of the test and part of this life.
[03:00:42.329 --> 03:00:47.354]  I admire the Lavoie gentleman that went out there.
[03:00:47.394 --> 03:00:48.595]  He was one of the better people out there.
[03:00:48.615 --> 03:00:49.716]  The Bundys are good too.
[03:00:50.136 --> 03:00:50.677]  They just...
[03:00:51.903 --> 03:00:54.085]  Aren't sophisticated when it comes to PSYOPs.
[03:01:22.483 --> 03:01:42.035]  I mean, they're just combining forces against him, and I just can't believe that Donald Trump really is anti-establishment, really is waking up to what's happening, really is understanding what's going on, and a lot of it's because one of his top campaign people, shadow campaign people, but really one of the head people, Stone,
[03:01:43.055 --> 03:01:48.718]  It is a big long-time listener and JFK writer, but also has been involved in a bunch of clandestine operations, obviously.
[03:01:49.158 --> 03:01:55.221]  I think it's people in the system, even you could say from dark side, that are getting behind Trump because they see where this is going.
[03:01:55.261 --> 03:02:04.065]  I mean, there's a lot of people that have had their butts on the fence, is what I'm saying, and I see a lot of people in the system now realizing this new world order is bad news.
[03:02:05.523 --> 03:02:06.124]  Well, it's true.
[03:02:06.224 --> 03:02:11.612]  Let me give you a review though of my big picture view of what they're trying to do with this election and how it's gone awry.
[03:02:12.173 --> 03:02:16.178]  First of all, they didn't really set Hillary Clinton up to win the election.
[03:02:16.198 --> 03:02:18.261]  They wanted to give us a controlled Republican.
[03:02:18.722 --> 03:02:20.184]  Donald Trump stymied that.
[03:02:20.805 --> 03:02:24.147]  He is continuing to do so, no matter how much they try to take him down.
[03:02:24.207 --> 03:02:29.489]  The establishment people, except for Rubio, just aren't making the grade and just aren't rising at all.
[03:02:30.690 --> 03:02:42.356]  And so now what they're looking at is, all right, if Trump does get the nomination, despite all our efforts, despite a controlled convention, if we can't stop Trump, we're going to have to win with a Democrat then.
[03:02:42.496 --> 03:02:46.898]  And Hillary is really seriously flawed, and so they're now debating
[03:02:47.378 --> 03:02:52.361]  How do we dump Hillary, you know, and still keep her in the ballpark?
[03:02:52.381 --> 03:02:55.463]  Do we let Sanders take on Trump?
[03:02:55.543 --> 03:02:57.004]  I don't think Sanders could beat Trump.
[03:02:57.464 --> 03:02:58.645]  Do we let Biden come in?
[03:02:58.705 --> 03:03:00.146]  I don't think Biden could beat Trump.
[03:03:01.214 --> 03:03:02.616]  So they've got a real problem.
[03:03:02.636 --> 03:03:08.080]  So this is one of the biggest political crises for the Proud House boys since they took the country over in 1913.
[03:03:09.401 --> 03:03:10.062]  Absolutely.
[03:03:10.102 --> 03:03:13.365]  They have never come up against this since Mitt Romney.
[03:03:13.405 --> 03:03:20.591]  Mitt Romney was a self-entered candidate that they had to defeat by eliminating some 10 million votes at the final election count.
[03:03:21.291 --> 03:03:24.074]  Did they threaten him not to run because he could have probably won this time?
[03:03:25.487 --> 03:03:25.927]  That's right.
[03:03:26.007 --> 03:03:26.828]  He could have.
[03:03:27.609 --> 03:03:28.749]  There were some threats.
[03:03:29.190 --> 03:03:30.311]  Very subtle things.
[03:03:30.431 --> 03:03:36.155]  But you know, you don't have to threaten very hard with someone like Mitt Romney who's bending over backwards to please the establishment.
[03:03:36.195 --> 03:03:37.596]  It takes some very mild things.
[03:03:37.636 --> 03:03:38.477]  You don't want to go there.
[03:03:39.457 --> 03:03:40.938]  But clearly he's not coming in.
[03:03:40.959 --> 03:03:42.380]  That's why I say watch out.
[03:03:42.520 --> 03:03:47.924]  The establishment isn't ready yet to stop throwing in more dark horses to compete against Trump.
[03:03:48.524 --> 03:03:51.926]  That's why I'm warning about Ben Sasse as the latest dark horse.
[03:03:52.086 --> 03:03:56.268]  But this has clearly got the establishment people in a real difficulty.
[03:03:56.308 --> 03:03:57.889]  They're holding meetings night and day about it.
[03:03:57.909 --> 03:03:59.090]  Trump is ultra smart.
[03:03:59.110 --> 03:04:01.211]  I mean, he knows that there's a good chance they're going to kill him.
[03:04:01.231 --> 03:04:02.272]  I mean, he's got to know that.
[03:04:03.120 --> 03:04:05.381]  Well, they can't do that, obviously.
[03:04:05.661 --> 03:04:08.162]  You know, I just don't think that's on the table right now.
[03:04:08.262 --> 03:04:11.282]  It might be if he got elected, they'd run an assassination attempt.
[03:04:11.323 --> 03:04:12.003]  Yeah, they shot Reagan.
[03:04:12.363 --> 03:04:13.563]  That's right, exactly.
[03:04:13.783 --> 03:04:16.604]  And they will do that to keep their agenda if he gets elected.
[03:04:17.164 --> 03:04:19.345]  But they still aren't out of ammunition yet.
[03:04:19.425 --> 03:04:22.846]  You watch for this manipulation as we go down through the primary system.
[03:04:23.206 --> 03:04:25.827]  Could Donald Trump, if he got elected, be the next Ronald Reagan?
[03:04:29.591 --> 03:04:34.354]  I don't think so, frankly, because Ronald Reagan was an ideological conservative.
[03:04:34.374 --> 03:04:35.294]  He did his own writing.
[03:04:35.314 --> 03:04:36.515]  He did his own speech writing.
[03:04:37.015 --> 03:04:40.837]  He had written things conservatively clear back before he was governor of California.
[03:04:41.177 --> 03:04:43.159]  Donald Trump doesn't have any of that background.
[03:04:43.579 --> 03:04:52.324]  Donald Trump, I think, has a good gut feeling for what's going on and the establishment and fighting against it, but he just doesn't have the background to not be fooled
[03:04:53.144 --> 03:04:57.287]  In the heat of battle, if he surrounds himself with some problematic advisors.
[03:04:57.347 --> 03:04:58.927]  If he got good advisors, I think he could.
[03:04:59.308 --> 03:05:02.930]  Well, I want to come and have you back in the next week or so and say, how would you advise Donald Trump?
[03:05:02.970 --> 03:05:05.131]  And I got a sneaking suspicion he'll end up watching it.
[03:05:05.331 --> 03:05:05.952]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:05.992 --> 03:05:06.832]  Thank you, Joel Skousen.

[03:08:10.066 --> 03:08:15.110]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:15.490 --> 03:08:17.812]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:18.953 --> 03:08:20.934]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[03:08:20.954 --> 03:08:24.016]  to 3 p.m., that's four hours of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:24.076 --> 03:08:34.044]  And generally, most days, in the fourth hour, one of our amazing research news anchors and hosts, Takari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo, and many others, David Knight,
[03:08:35.364 --> 03:08:37.125]  Ends up hosting the fourth hour.
[03:08:38.085 --> 03:08:42.126]  And then, of course, we've also got the Sunday transmission, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:08:42.166 --> 03:08:43.966]  Central, that I, or David Knight, host.
[03:08:44.867 --> 03:08:49.588]  But generally, I end up hosting about three and a half hours a day.
[03:08:50.088 --> 03:08:53.809]  Then we also have InfoWars Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[03:08:54.229 --> 03:09:00.671]  And then tomorrow night will be four or five hours long, since David Knight is going out to the boondocks.
[03:09:01.571 --> 03:09:06.713]  They're in Oregon to cover the ongoing Waco-style standoff now after one's been killed.
[03:09:07.513 --> 03:09:10.574]  Executed style, it looks like, out on the road.
[03:09:12.995 --> 03:09:19.618]  Last night, so we're sending David Knight and Joe Biggs this evening out there so they can report tomorrow.
[03:09:19.698 --> 03:09:20.838]  Hopefully this gets resolved.
[03:09:21.238 --> 03:09:28.221]  So whether it's an ongoing crisis or it's resolved, we'll report on the aftermath and investigate the killing of
[03:09:29.946 --> 03:09:37.853]  Mr. Lavoie got his hands up in front of six witnesses and they reportedly executed him and had the news announce it was a shootout.
[03:09:38.393 --> 03:09:39.994]  But then now they admit it wasn't a shootout.
[03:09:40.815 --> 03:09:42.637]  So just really disgusting.
[03:09:43.117 --> 03:09:54.206]  But that said, ladies and gentlemen, and we're going to hand the baton to Jakari and Leanne McAdoo, Rome covers up nude statues in museum for Iran president.
[03:09:54.226 --> 03:09:55.067]  You see the censorship?
[03:09:56.445 --> 03:10:02.687]  That's just the type of stuff that's going on in the West, where we're just supposed to get rid of all of our art, our symbols, everything.
[03:10:02.707 --> 03:10:06.589]  They tell women, don't wear short skirts, or, you know, the Muslims are allowed to rape you.
[03:10:06.989 --> 03:10:08.650]  I mean, this is political correctness.
[03:10:08.670 --> 03:10:10.050]  This is the left.
[03:10:10.110 --> 03:10:11.511]  These are not leftist.
[03:10:12.751 --> 03:10:15.572]  And in the modern sense, they're just mind-control scum.
[03:10:16.353 --> 03:10:17.253]  Doomsday Clock.
[03:10:18.754 --> 03:10:19.734]  Now, this is so important.
[03:10:19.774 --> 03:10:20.534]  Doomsday Clock.
[03:10:21.054 --> 03:10:23.315]  World more dangerous than during Cold War.
[03:10:23.395 --> 03:10:24.996]  That is the Hill newspaper.
[03:10:26.442 --> 03:10:29.283]  And I hope Jakari and Leanne talk about that some, because it's a big deal.
[03:10:29.483 --> 03:10:36.145]  The world is as close to destruction as it has been in 20 years, a group of scientific leaders, policy experts, and former officials warned Tuesday.
[03:10:36.205 --> 03:10:46.007]  The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists chose to keep its so-called doomsday clock at three minutes to midnight this year, but said the lack of tick forward shouldn't be taken as a good sign.
[03:10:46.507 --> 03:10:51.369]  And then they just go on to say it's probably the highest it's ever been, certainly in the last 20 years of the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[03:10:51.789 --> 03:10:52.869]  And I think it's more dangerous.
[03:10:55.512 --> 03:10:57.533]  Continuing a Fed rate meeting.
[03:10:57.553 --> 03:10:59.494]  Global stock market volatility puts U.S.
[03:10:59.534 --> 03:11:00.774]  Central Bank on the hot seat.
[03:11:00.814 --> 03:11:02.715]  Stock market continually is going down.
[03:11:03.535 --> 03:11:14.059]  Continuing, France declares permanent police state, state of emergency, because the radical Muslims they brought in are targeting nationalist patriots, conservatives and Christians, arresting them en masse for speech.
[03:11:14.680 --> 03:11:19.321]  Sweden army chief warns of World War III inside Europe within a few years.
[03:11:21.778 --> 03:11:22.018]  Yep.
[03:11:22.799 --> 03:11:32.165]  France's highways are sending to chaos and lawlessness as third world populations from Eastern Europe and North Africa, Middle East, just are crawling around everywhere.
[03:11:32.545 --> 03:11:37.488]  We've shown you the footage of just the carjackings, the robbing, the pulling, and the police won't even arrest people.
[03:11:37.508 --> 03:11:39.029]  It's just like, you're allowed to!
[03:11:39.289 --> 03:11:41.091]  They're even allowed to rape in many areas.
[03:11:41.451 --> 03:11:44.273]  It's come out, they have an agreement, the police won't prosecute.
[03:11:44.633 --> 03:11:46.714]  I mean, just, whoa!
[03:11:46.934 --> 03:11:49.256]  I mean, you talk about psycho-evil, that's the left.
[03:11:50.459 --> 03:11:52.780]  And the so-called conservative parties they work with.
[03:11:53.801 --> 03:11:55.362]  We covered this big time yesterday.
[03:11:55.482 --> 03:12:01.125]  Senator Warren's martial law bill introduced set up worldwide martial law powers.
[03:12:01.865 --> 03:12:03.786]  And it's introduced by the majority leader of the Senate.
[03:12:05.947 --> 03:12:07.888]  And still, I googled it this morning.
[03:12:07.928 --> 03:12:08.648]  In fact, do it again.
[03:12:09.069 --> 03:12:12.590]  Is there any news on this in the news tab?
[03:12:12.650 --> 03:12:15.172]  I mean, has any media picked this up other than alternative media?
[03:12:16.761 --> 03:12:18.802]  That tells you everything you need to know.
[03:12:18.863 --> 03:12:21.444]  I mean, that is sensationally bad.
[03:12:22.785 --> 03:12:23.546]  I can't even believe it.
[03:12:23.986 --> 03:12:28.949]  Report DHS incapable of accurately reporting visa overstays.
[03:12:28.989 --> 03:12:34.253]  Of course, they fly the illegals in on jets and drive them in on buses and give them free vouchers.
[03:12:36.374 --> 03:12:38.916]  You only get checked, basically, if you're a citizen now, folks.
[03:12:39.436 --> 03:12:42.398]  Because you're known as a chump by the occupying enemy army.
[03:12:43.178 --> 03:12:45.220]  Bringing in foreigners to get us all fighting with each other.
[03:12:46.601 --> 03:12:50.182]  Backdoor gun control is one of the most horrible draconian actions.
[03:12:50.202 --> 03:12:53.022]  We knew it was coming, but not just when you go to the psychologist or psychiatrist.
[03:12:53.283 --> 03:12:56.883]  Now when you go to a doctor's visit, the feds want it to be under Obama.
[03:12:57.043 --> 03:12:58.344]  They're doing it basically in many areas.
[03:12:59.404 --> 03:13:02.125]  Where they make you fill out a questionnaire or ask you questions.
[03:13:02.325 --> 03:13:03.245]  Feeling anxious?
[03:13:03.285 --> 03:13:03.805]  Get depressed?
[03:13:03.825 --> 03:13:04.585]  Get angry ever?
[03:13:06.265 --> 03:13:06.726]  Oh, that's it.
[03:13:06.746 --> 03:13:07.386]  Your guns are gone.
[03:13:07.786 --> 03:13:08.886]  That's a Kit Daniels article.
[03:13:08.906 --> 03:13:12.447]  State police already confiscated veterans' guns over insomnia.
[03:13:13.755 --> 03:13:17.076]  Or the guy that had his guns confiscated because he said he drank four beers a day.
[03:13:18.997 --> 03:13:20.157]  No judge, no jury.
[03:13:20.778 --> 03:13:22.258]  You want a police state, you got it.
[03:13:22.298 --> 03:13:30.341]  That's why Homeland Security is approaching every physician I basically talk to, and a lot of them get excited and get their little tattletale card and everything, and some of them even get money.
[03:13:31.061 --> 03:13:35.543]  And so they're actually working for the feds covertly as an intelligence operative.
[03:13:37.183 --> 03:13:38.304]  That's not creepy at all.
[03:13:38.724 --> 03:13:41.145]  And then they're there to get your guns and set you up.
[03:13:42.401 --> 03:13:52.825]  Now, a lot of them aren't traitors, but, because they're more informed and educated and usually are entrepreneurial, but, man, I tell you, we are going authoritarian in royal flush.
[03:13:53.086 --> 03:13:54.426]  I mean, it is sick.
[03:13:55.567 --> 03:13:55.867]  U.S.
[03:13:55.887 --> 03:13:56.867]  destabilize Europe.
[03:13:56.987 --> 03:14:00.169]  Austrian record-holding athlete lashes out.
[03:14:00.249 --> 03:14:01.249]  Absolutely, that's the plan.
[03:14:02.790 --> 03:14:05.571]  60% of refugees heading to Europe are economic migrants.
[03:14:05.651 --> 03:14:06.151]  EU official.
[03:14:06.571 --> 03:14:09.052]  Feminized males will allow Muslims to conquer Europe.
[03:14:09.132 --> 03:14:10.093]  Absolutely, they love it.
[03:14:11.001 --> 03:14:17.406]  They love to get beat up while their girlfriend gets drug off and gang raped and then hood put on her head and the police just hail it.
[03:14:17.426 --> 03:14:18.788]  They just love it.
[03:14:18.828 --> 03:14:34.241]  It's a symbol of conquering Europe by the state that hates its slaves, hates its minions, and just wants to slap them around because there's nothing they want put up with, nothing they don't love, no amount of humiliation they don't want.
[03:14:35.404 --> 03:14:36.266]  Top Bilderberg!
[03:14:36.306 --> 03:14:38.471]  Global super elite must stop Donald Trump!
[03:14:39.373 --> 03:14:40.415]  Infowars.com.
[03:14:40.675 --> 03:14:41.477]  Very important article.
[03:14:41.698 --> 03:14:44.624]  Hillary Clinton drops below 50% nationally, even in stage polls.
[03:14:45.125 --> 03:14:45.806]  Clintonista!
[03:14:47.165 --> 03:14:53.486]  Complains to Twitter that co-founder that Hillary mocking hashtag is pure misogyny, wants banning Hillary to be done.
[03:14:54.487 --> 03:14:59.228]  Lena Dunham, some trendy actress, wants to tell the media what they can write about Hillary.
[03:14:59.248 --> 03:15:07.689]  I mean, these people are just flaming, out of control, gibbering nobody, ugly, dumb tyrants.
[03:15:08.110 --> 03:15:14.231]  But, doesn't matter, we fall in worship then and do whatever they say, rolling over on our backs like a puppy.
[03:15:16.092 --> 03:15:17.112]  Just in total fear.
[03:15:17.592 --> 03:15:18.293]  Because we love it!
[03:15:18.573 --> 03:15:19.674]  We love it!
[03:15:21.295 --> 03:15:22.215]  Land of the cowards!
[03:15:22.295 --> 03:15:23.176]  Home of the slaves!
[03:15:23.616 --> 03:15:24.596]  Land of the idiots!
[03:15:24.857 --> 03:15:26.858]  Just groveling, loving every minute of it.
[03:15:28.799 --> 03:15:31.340]  It just goes on and on and on and on and on.
[03:15:31.580 --> 03:15:34.362]  Really, there's a certain percentage that's like that.
[03:15:34.382 --> 03:15:36.843]  A big percentage, though, really, really hates the government.
[03:15:37.204 --> 03:15:41.326]  CBS News poll, the government is just hated more than organized crime.
[03:15:41.366 --> 03:15:42.386]  Because it is organized crime.
[03:15:42.707 --> 03:15:43.087]  At the top.
[03:15:44.249 --> 03:15:47.730]  Main Governor, Paul LePage, bring back the guillotine for drug traffickers.
[03:15:48.110 --> 03:15:50.711]  Oh, like the CIA and the big banks that publicly run it all?
[03:15:51.371 --> 03:15:53.832]  I just love these anti-drug people.
[03:15:54.772 --> 03:15:57.353]  You know, I mean, everybody knows who brings the drugs in.
[03:15:57.393 --> 03:15:59.974]  They want to keep it illegal to keep the prices up.
[03:16:00.394 --> 03:16:01.234]  Give me a break.
[03:16:01.494 --> 03:16:02.615]  City demands firearms.
[03:16:02.695 --> 03:16:04.675]  Applicants write essays explaining the need for a gun.
[03:16:05.036 --> 03:16:06.316]  And they, of course, refuse most of them.
[03:16:06.336 --> 03:16:07.616]  But nobody wants your guns, folks.
[03:16:07.956 --> 03:16:11.898]  Monsanto sues to block listing of herbicide ingredient as a carcinogen.
[03:16:11.998 --> 03:16:12.638]  On and on and on.
[03:16:14.599 --> 03:16:17.182]  I'm going to hand the baton to Ja'Kari and Leigh-Anne now.
[03:16:18.503 --> 03:16:28.134]  But before I do that, I wanted to just remind everybody one more time today that we're running the biggest special ever on DNA Force.
[03:16:29.015 --> 03:16:35.223]  DNA Force, 25% off and you get free shipping on orders of $50 or more at infowarestore.com.
[03:16:37.918 --> 03:16:39.960]  And your purchase makes all of this transmission possible.
[03:16:39.980 --> 03:16:41.301]  Let me tell you about DNA Force.
[03:16:41.601 --> 03:16:47.987]  For a limited time, get our flagship nutraceutical DNA Force for 25% off at InfoWarsLive.com while supplies last.
[03:16:48.347 --> 03:16:50.229]  It'll run out by next week at current sales rates.
[03:16:50.609 --> 03:16:54.612]  This is our most advanced product in the InfoWars Lifeline.
[03:16:55.393 --> 03:16:59.096]  We did extensive research to design this formulation for maximum impact.
[03:16:59.476 --> 03:17:02.259]  It includes patented ingredients that are lab quality.
[03:17:02.619 --> 03:17:04.560]  These ingredients are difficult to source.
[03:17:04.961 --> 03:17:06.162]  Bio-PQQ.
[03:17:06.702 --> 03:17:14.228]  DNA force is loaded with a patented Bio-PQQ compound, which is backed by 175 clinical studies by major respected researchers.
[03:17:14.508 --> 03:17:16.050]  We have those in info or store.com.
[03:17:16.610 --> 03:17:20.773]  The amazing compound is known to influence nerve growth and regeneration, just to say a few things.
[03:17:21.233 --> 03:17:24.075]  It is known to support the powerhouse of the cell, the mitochondria.
[03:17:24.816 --> 03:17:26.918]  They are the source of energy in our bodies.
[03:17:27.578 --> 03:17:33.282]  CoQ10 is known for the most powerful antioxidants that protect your cells from free radicals.
[03:17:33.682 --> 03:17:37.425]  CoQ10 is essentially the basic cell function of many primary building blocks of life.
[03:17:38.106 --> 03:17:40.407]  Levels of the body decrease dramatically with age above 40.
[03:17:41.568 --> 03:17:58.239]  There are only two of the more than nine powerful ingredients in DNA Force, including digestive enzymes, trans-reservatrol of the highest quality, and many others that work in concert to promote better health, more energy, and even regrow damaged or atrophied nerves.
[03:17:59.600 --> 03:18:02.282]  We can actually say that about this product, because it's nutraceutical.
[03:18:02.923 --> 03:18:05.104]  We buy it from big Japanese pharma.
[03:18:05.124 --> 03:18:08.046]  I mean, it's the real deal, and slash the price of it.
[03:18:08.586 --> 03:18:10.308]  That's why we're so aggressive and capitalistic.
[03:18:12.429 --> 03:18:16.152]  They might send other nutraceutical companies after me if we keep doing this, though.
[03:18:16.433 --> 03:18:20.596]  Folks are really upset about this, because it's undercutting the whole market, which is what free marketers do.
[03:18:20.656 --> 03:18:22.137]  Sorry, I'm very aggressive.
[03:18:22.497 --> 03:18:28.282]  There is a reason why just one ingredient, DNA Force, costs around $30,000 per batch.
[03:18:29.783 --> 03:18:32.846]  And of course, that's what two of them, I thought it was 14, whatever.
[03:18:33.146 --> 03:18:35.268]  This is the best, I think it's 14, because it's a typo.
[03:18:35.908 --> 03:18:38.871]  This is the best quality and formulation available worldwide.
[03:18:39.810 --> 03:18:43.613]  DNA Force, well, no, actually the batch has two kilos in it, so I guess that's right, sorry.
[03:18:44.614 --> 03:18:49.637]  The DNA Force is extremely hard to produce, and when we run out, we often are out of stock for months.
[03:18:49.657 --> 03:18:50.418]  It's going to be five weeks.
[03:18:50.938 --> 03:18:52.619]  I want everybody to try this amazing product.
[03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:57.343]  So we're dropping the price from our premium product by 25% for a limited time.
[03:18:57.403 --> 03:18:58.103]  All supplies last.
[03:18:58.143 --> 03:19:01.146]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com and take advantage of the unprecedented special.
[03:19:01.386 --> 03:19:02.727]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:19:07.230 --> 03:19:09.932]  All right, I'm going to hand the baton to Jakari Jackson.
[03:19:10.292 --> 03:19:13.133]  Jakari Jackson, tell us what's coming up next.
[03:19:13.774 --> 03:19:14.614]  We have a lot of news.
[03:19:14.674 --> 03:19:15.375]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:19:15.415 --> 03:19:25.901]  We're going to be talking about Kit Daniels' article, Backdoor Gun Confiscation, talking about how doctors, not just psychologists, are going to be screening adults for depression to see if they can take away their gun rights.
[03:19:26.281 --> 03:19:34.264]  Also, as you mentioned, David Knight and the crew, as well as Joe Biggs, are going to go up to Oregon to talk about the most recent situation going on up there.
[03:19:34.284 --> 03:19:41.907]  So if you've heard the commercials talking about the debates tomorrow and our coverage of that, we will be covering the debate, but David Knight and Joe Biggs will be on location.
[03:19:42.167 --> 03:19:46.969]  So talking about that, we'll also have clips from Donald Trump, who's saying he's not going to be at the debate.
[03:19:47.289 --> 03:19:51.331]  So we'll come back and talk about all that with Leanne McAdoo, as well as a special report from John Bowne.
[03:19:51.631 --> 03:19:52.111]  Stay tuned.
[03:19:52.151 --> 03:19:53.632]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:53.732 --> 03:19:58.275]  Alright, Jakari, great job, but the 10 seconds we got, let me ask you, did we not call what was gonna happen in Oregon?
[03:19:58.335 --> 03:19:59.196]  Is this not a tragedy?
[03:19:59.616 --> 03:20:03.159]  I mean, definitely is a tragedy, and I hope they can have cooler heads prevail up there.
[03:20:03.919 --> 03:20:05.240]  Lookin' sharp, Jakari!
[03:20:05.640 --> 03:20:06.301]  We'll be back!
[03:20:12.014 --> 03:20:18.480]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a SelectQuote agent with a true story of how SelectQuote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[03:20:19.420 --> 03:20:22.203]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:20:23.043 --> 03:20:26.707]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:20:27.387 --> 03:20:28.627]  I said, let me see.
[03:20:29.188 --> 03:20:39.791]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:20:40.271 --> 03:20:51.394]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[03:20:52.355 --> 03:20:53.055]  How about you?
[03:20:53.355 --> 03:20:54.656]  For your free quote, call 1-800-654-1632.
[03:20:54.676 --> 03:20:54.976]  That's 1-800-654-1632.
[03:20:54.996 --> 03:20:55.056]  1-800-654-1632.
[03:20:55.076 --> 03:20:56.096]  Or go to selectquote.com.
[03:20:56.116 --> 03:20:56.476]  We shop.
[03:20:56.496 --> 03:20:56.756]  You save.
[03:21:08.960 --> 03:21:15.684]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and is sold out in many areas of the country.
[03:21:16.045 --> 03:21:19.707]  It caught me totally by surprise and it involves FEMA.
[03:21:20.047 --> 03:21:23.009]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[03:21:23.449 --> 03:21:28.533]  Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[03:21:29.133 --> 03:21:33.154]  Watch the viral video at FEMA3.com before it disappears again.
[03:21:33.494 --> 03:21:39.096]  But be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is, they must know something we don't.
[03:21:39.656 --> 03:21:49.679]  Go to FEMA3.com to see the number one item you should be hoarding and why supplies of this critical item are so low or even completely sold out at many stores across America.
[03:21:50.379 --> 03:21:51.259]  Don't miss out.
[03:21:51.620 --> 03:21:56.321]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in recent days.

[03:22:06.065 --> 03:22:07.125]  Again, that's FEMA3.com.

[03:23:08.958 --> 03:23:10.940]  Are you sneezing, coughing and aching?
[03:23:10.960 --> 03:23:14.404]  Do you have a sore throat, a fever or the sniffles?

[03:24:16.425 --> 03:24:18.247]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:18.267 --> 03:24:21.449]  Jakari Jackson hosting this hour along with Leanne McAdoo.
[03:24:21.909 --> 03:24:24.451]  Now we have a bit of a programming note for you guys.
[03:24:24.471 --> 03:24:26.393]  You guys have probably heard the commercial we've been running.
[03:24:26.633 --> 03:24:32.037]  We have some breaking news that has switched the way things are going to run for the next couple of days.
[03:24:33.058 --> 03:24:40.885]  We're advertising that the debate coverage is going to be tomorrow night, which will continue, but originally we said David Knight and Joe Biggs were going to be here in studio.
[03:24:40.905 --> 03:24:50.574]  They're actually going to Oregon, so it'll be myself, Leanne, as well as the remaining crew here in the InfoWars.com studio, and Joe Biggs and David Knight will be up in Oregon for that.
[03:24:50.955 --> 03:24:52.416]  But now let's talk about the debate coverage.
[03:24:52.436 --> 03:24:58.522]  I have Leanne here in studio, and one of the people who said that they're not going to be at this debate is Donald Trump.
[03:24:58.922 --> 03:25:08.005]  And we actually have a clip from Mr. Trump, if we could pull this up, where he's talking about his relationship with Fox News, how he does not trust Fox News, and in particular, Megyn Kelly.
[03:25:09.465 --> 03:25:15.086]  I didn't like the fact that they sent out press releases toying, talking about Putin and playing games.
[03:25:15.126 --> 03:25:19.068]  I don't know what games Roger Ailes is playing, but what's wrong over there?
[03:25:19.368 --> 03:25:20.148]  Something's wrong.
[03:25:20.568 --> 03:25:24.989]  But when they sent out that press release talking about, I said, what are these people playing games?
[03:25:25.169 --> 03:25:27.570]  So most likely, I won't be doing the debate.
[03:25:27.990 --> 03:25:29.432]  We'll have our own event.
[03:25:29.893 --> 03:25:31.675]  We'll raise some money for the Wounded Warriors.
[03:25:31.815 --> 03:25:33.377]  We'll raise money for the vets.
[03:25:33.718 --> 03:25:37.803]  But when they sent out the Wiseguy press releases a little while ago, I was all set to do the debate.
[03:25:38.083 --> 03:25:39.565]  I came here to do the debate.
[03:25:39.885 --> 03:25:41.467]  Megyn Kelly is a lightweight.
[03:25:41.527 --> 03:25:42.429]  This is a lightweight.
[03:25:42.809 --> 03:25:43.890]  This is not a reporter.
[03:25:43.930 --> 03:25:45.533]  This to me is just a lightweight.
[03:25:46.333 --> 03:25:48.454]  Megyn Kelly shouldn't be in the debate.
[03:25:48.874 --> 03:25:49.794]  I don't care about Megyn.
[03:25:50.414 --> 03:25:54.316]  When Megyn Kelly didn't ask me a question, she made a statement last time.
[03:25:54.696 --> 03:25:55.936]  I thought it was inappropriate.
[03:25:56.376 --> 03:25:57.897]  Everybody said I won the debate.
[03:25:58.037 --> 03:25:59.617]  Everybody said I won the last debate.
[03:25:59.637 --> 03:26:00.998]  They said I won all of the debates.
[03:26:01.538 --> 03:26:02.818]  We've had six debates now.
[03:26:03.319 --> 03:26:07.040]  Why should the networks continue getting rich on these debates?
[03:26:08.018 --> 03:26:13.204]  All right, and there you have it right there, Leanne, saying that he's not a big fan of the way the debates are being handled.
[03:26:13.465 --> 03:26:16.709]  And, you know, I guess you could say that about any network.
[03:26:17.049 --> 03:26:20.413]  We've seen other debates on other channels where they definitely just straight up attack the guys.
[03:26:20.433 --> 03:26:23.257]  They're asking about fantasy football and all types of other stupidness.
[03:26:23.277 --> 03:26:27.562]  But what do you think about this most recent deal with Trump saying he just doesn't want to participate?
[03:26:27.782 --> 03:26:30.584]  Well, and of course they throw softballs to Hillary Clinton.
[03:26:30.864 --> 03:26:32.345]  Obama says he really likes you.
[03:26:32.405 --> 03:26:33.866]  What do you think about that, Hillary?
[03:26:34.386 --> 03:26:41.711]  You know, so it's completely biased and he's not wrong, but we saw what happened with Rand Paul last time when he skipped the debate.
[03:26:41.811 --> 03:26:44.393]  He was the top trending thing on Twitter and he wasn't even there.
[03:26:44.853 --> 03:26:45.554]  So I think this was...
[03:26:46.514 --> 03:26:50.796]  If he does in fact decide that he's not going to show up, I think this is a smart move by him.
[03:26:51.196 --> 03:26:57.218]  But let's all kind of take a step back here and look at what's going on behind the scene.
[03:26:57.639 --> 03:27:03.381]  Now we reported on this yesterday about an insider who said it doesn't matter about Trump, Hillary will win.
[03:27:03.761 --> 03:27:05.322]  Now the reason why this is important
[03:27:05.982 --> 03:27:08.102]  Is because this came from Martin Sorrell.
[03:27:08.162 --> 03:27:09.943]  He's a highly influential CEO.
[03:27:10.723 --> 03:27:11.983]  He has ties to Fox News.
[03:27:12.263 --> 03:27:15.704]  He's the chief executive officer of WPPPLC.
[03:27:16.944 --> 03:27:22.265]  So they have ties to Fox News, but their affiliates represent up to half of all Fox News ad revenue.
[03:27:22.585 --> 03:27:27.226]  Clients include Ford, GlaxoSmith, IBM, Microsoft, Nestle, Walmart, Unilever.
[03:27:27.246 --> 03:27:29.387]  So these are all people who spend millions of dollars.
[03:27:29.407 --> 03:27:29.587]  Yes.
[03:27:29.947 --> 03:27:35.453]  Every single month on Fox News advertising, so for him to come out and say this, but that's not it.
[03:27:36.033 --> 03:27:46.964]  We've also got another top Bilderberger who is the associate editor of the Financial Times, Martin Wolf, insisting that the global super elite must stop Donald Trump from winning the presidency.
[03:27:47.364 --> 03:27:56.011]  He wrote this article called, The Economic Losers Are In Revolt Against The Elites, and he's basically telling his rich friends that we must stop Trump.
[03:27:56.191 --> 03:28:02.876]  So, unless this is like some ultimate reverse psychology, because, you know, Trump himself is a billionaire, they're really afraid of him.
[03:28:03.570 --> 03:28:11.253]  Yeah, and let me be very clear, I'm not on Team Trump, but I do think it's rather interesting how they continue to target this guy because they don't control him.
[03:28:12.093 --> 03:28:20.076]  So that's the big deal, he's not an establishment guy, they can't control him, they can't hold his leash so they don't know exactly what he's going to do if he was to get into office.
[03:28:20.356 --> 03:28:27.899]  Now on that, we also have another Trump clip where he's talking about how much support he has and how he could actually just walk up and shoot somebody in the head.
[03:28:28.619 --> 03:28:30.960]  And he still wouldn't lose any supporters.
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:32.321]  It's a very bold statement.
[03:28:32.361 --> 03:28:38.243]  But, you know, he seems, in some people's eyes, to be able to do no wrong, you know, even if it's a controversial statement.
[03:28:38.343 --> 03:28:41.344]  A lot of times they take stuff out of context that he does say.
[03:28:41.364 --> 03:28:41.985]  I will give him that.
[03:28:42.025 --> 03:28:43.565]  Sometimes they just completely twist his words.
[03:28:43.905 --> 03:28:47.927]  But for the stuff he has said that people didn't like, it just doesn't seem to knock him down.
[03:28:48.267 --> 03:28:52.109]  Let's go ahead and see Donald Trump saying that he could shoot somebody and still get away with it.
[03:28:53.393 --> 03:28:54.574]  My people are so smart.
[03:28:54.835 --> 03:28:56.476]  And you know what else they say about my people?
[03:28:56.516 --> 03:28:56.877]  The polls.
[03:28:57.357 --> 03:28:58.879]  They say I have the most loyal people.
[03:28:58.899 --> 03:28:59.619]  Did you ever see that?
[03:29:00.220 --> 03:29:04.584]  Where I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters, okay?
[03:29:04.825 --> 03:29:05.525]  It's like incredible.
[03:29:05.926 --> 03:29:07.547]  Yeah, that is pretty incredible.
[03:29:07.568 --> 03:29:08.048]  Thank you guys.
[03:29:08.188 --> 03:29:09.369]  Trump, we love you too, man.
[03:29:09.730 --> 03:29:11.752]  Trump's voters are by far, you know, I'm at 68, 69 percent.
[03:29:11.772 --> 03:29:12.332]  I'm at 90 percent.
[03:29:16.181 --> 03:29:16.541]  Total.
[03:29:17.062 --> 03:29:18.723]  Like, when did you say that?
[03:29:18.763 --> 03:29:19.123]  Yeah, definitely.
[03:29:19.143 --> 03:29:27.448]  That's a very passionate group of supporters and I believe Richard Reeves is also going to be on the ground out there on our debate coverage so you guys can tune in and watch that as well.
[03:29:27.868 --> 03:29:30.109]  But it's not just the Republicans in the race, Liam.
[03:29:30.129 --> 03:29:31.110]  We also have the Democrats.
[03:29:31.150 --> 03:29:34.532]  We have a clip of Bernie Sanders that we will play when we come back after this break.
[03:29:34.872 --> 03:29:37.573]  And also, we can go ahead and start lining up the phone.
[03:29:38.234 --> 03:29:39.074]  We can get the number out.
[03:29:39.094 --> 03:29:39.154]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:29:42.216 --> 03:29:42.456]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:29:42.596 --> 03:29:47.139]  That will get you up and on the air in the next segment.
[03:29:47.420 --> 03:29:47.820]  Stay tuned.
[03:29:47.840 --> 03:29:51.522]  Jakari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo from the InfoWars.com Command Center.
[03:29:58.066 --> 03:29:58.967]  We're on the march.
[03:29:59.467 --> 03:30:01.048]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:01.989 --> 03:30:04.671]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.130 --> 03:30:12.711]  You hear a lot about the cashless society, but Europeans aren't buying it.
[03:30:13.012 --> 03:30:21.715]  According to the European Central Bank, a record 1 trillion euros of banknotes were in circulation in 2015, almost double the value 10 years ago.
[03:30:22.055 --> 03:30:24.576]  Paper money in circulation rose 6.5% last year, the most since 2008.
[03:30:27.855 --> 03:30:32.678]  In 2008, people were worried about financial turbulence and crashing markets then with good reason.
[03:30:32.879 --> 03:30:37.261]  And this year has begun with the worst two-week start on record for financial markets.
[03:30:37.562 --> 03:30:41.784]  But in 2015, we now have negative interest rates on bank accounts.
[03:30:42.245 --> 03:30:45.747]  And the risk of flat-out confiscation of accounts by government.
[03:30:45.827 --> 03:30:47.468]  What they call haircuts.
[03:30:50.190 --> 03:30:51.891]  And then there's privacy.
[03:30:51.951 --> 03:30:52.491]  Cashless?
[03:30:52.771 --> 03:30:53.172]  No thanks.
[03:30:54.052 --> 03:30:57.956]  Negative interest rates, risk of confiscation, economic uncertainty?
[03:30:58.556 --> 03:30:59.517]  I'll take it in cash.
[03:31:00.398 --> 03:31:04.822]  Paper notes may not be real money, but they sure beat negative interest and haircuts.
[03:31:05.542 --> 03:31:07.504]  For Prison Planet TV, I'm David Knight.
[03:31:08.685 --> 03:31:15.571]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.
[03:31:15.891 --> 03:31:25.274]  At InfoWarsLife, our mission is to bring you the highest quality, purest, cleanest, effective colloidal silver on the market today for the lowest price available.
[03:31:25.554 --> 03:31:32.416]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com has taken colloidal silver to the next level using a cutting-edge technique that is free of toxic artificial additives.

[03:32:12.767 --> 03:32:17.392]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.

[03:32:18.873 --> 03:32:20.354]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[03:32:20.374 --> 03:32:21.996]  I have drive to go to the gym.

[03:33:20.666 --> 03:33:25.151]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones!
[03:33:34.437 --> 03:33:46.166]  Now that the Bill of Rights have been largely destroyed by our corporatized government, President Obama has decided to go for the meat of the American Constitution, the War Powers of the Constitution.
[03:33:46.426 --> 03:34:01.378]  Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11 of the United States Constitution, sometimes referred to as the War Powers Clause, vests in the Congress the power to declare war.
[03:34:01.939 --> 03:34:03.019]  This resolution
[03:34:04.039 --> 03:34:04.099]  Is
[03:34:19.628 --> 03:34:25.573]  So while the East Coast was buried under record snowfall, Obama's faux-Republican minions Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell
[03:34:41.807 --> 03:34:48.528]  Scuttled another dangerous fast-track bill into the halls of the most hated Congress in U.S.
[03:34:48.568 --> 03:34:49.029]  history.
[03:34:49.449 --> 03:34:55.530]  The legislation makes the unconstitutional Iraq war authorization of 2002 look like a walk in the park.
[03:34:56.210 --> 03:35:05.012]  It will allow this president and future presidents to wage war against ISIS without restrictions on time, geographic scope, or the use of ground troops.
[03:35:05.472 --> 03:35:10.673]  It is a completely open-ended authorization for the president to use the military as he wishes
[03:35:11.073 --> 03:35:12.994]  For as long as he or she wishes.
[03:35:13.795 --> 03:35:21.279]  Even President Obama has expressed concern over how willing Congress is to hand him unlimited power to wage war.
[03:35:21.559 --> 03:35:35.168]  The Foreign Relations Committee, whose chair is Senator Bob Corker, suggested that a new authorization for use of military force was unlikely to happen, and that President Obama currently has the legal authority he needs.
[03:35:35.948 --> 03:35:41.310]  Corker's authority was bypassed by McConnell's treasonous fast track.
[03:35:41.750 --> 03:35:49.653]  And Senator Lindsey Graham bleated out to reporters, if the Democrats don't want to give this to Obama, then stand up and tell me why.
[03:35:49.933 --> 03:35:53.834]  There may be some people running for president as Republicans who don't want this.
[03:35:54.294 --> 03:36:00.036]  I would be astonished that anybody seeking to be commander-in-chief wouldn't want this power.
[03:36:00.316 --> 03:36:06.939]  It would allow the administration to fight the terror group ISIS wherever, whenever, and however.
[03:36:07.399 --> 03:36:11.221]  As if the real threat of ISIS was a mystery to the American people.
[03:36:11.661 --> 03:36:18.084]  Most Americans are fully aware that our greatest threat lies in Obama's policies regarding immigration.
[03:36:18.504 --> 03:36:29.809]  The bill isn't even warm yet, and Vice President Joe Biden is in Turkey cheerleading World War III, presenting both sides of the issue to Turkey and the American people.
[03:36:30.177 --> 03:36:33.240]  Our allies in the region were our largest problem in Syria.
[03:36:34.021 --> 03:36:38.866]  The Turks were great friends, and I have a great relationship with Erdogan, which I just spent a lot of time with.
[03:36:39.747 --> 03:36:50.579]  They poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens, thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad.
[03:36:51.130 --> 03:37:02.749]  Except that the people who were being supplied were al-Nusra and Al-Qaeda and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world.
[03:37:03.809 --> 03:37:22.984]  Following World War II, the United States leadership has continually sought to foment and drive the industrial military complex machine into an unending unconstitutional state of global war, creating the very enemies Obama's dictatorial powers would seek to suppress.
[03:37:23.304 --> 03:37:31.250]  We have finally reached the precipice of the total annihilation of the balance of powers that act as the foundation of our republic.
[03:37:31.972 --> 03:37:36.896]  Let's not get involved in constitutional arguments.
[03:37:37.136 --> 03:37:51.246]  President Obama is desperately attempting to disarm the public and re-engineer the United States into a lawless military state overseen by corrupt politicians on par with the horror south of our border.
[03:37:51.726 --> 03:37:53.648]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[03:37:54.388 --> 03:38:00.151]  Another excellent report from John Bowne, and those are the type of reports you get to see when you tune into the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:38:00.591 --> 03:38:03.413]  I'm Jakari Jackson, joining studio with Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[03:38:03.853 --> 03:38:12.817]  Now, we have several callers lined up, but I want to dovetail on what John Bowne was saying, which actually ties into what Tim in California is going to say, but give us just one second here, Tim.
[03:38:13.418 --> 03:38:21.782]  He played the clip of the Senator, I believe she is from Maryland, saying when she was talking about gun control and gun legislation, let's not get caught up on this constitutional argument.
[03:38:22.102 --> 03:38:28.007]  Let's not sit around and have a debate of whether or not new laws and regulations are going to violate that Constitution.
[03:38:28.027 --> 03:38:29.508]  This pesky piece of paper.
[03:38:29.828 --> 03:38:34.853]  Yeah, you just need to wipe your behind with that piece of paper, I guess, is how they feel about it.
[03:38:35.293 --> 03:38:38.736]  And more on that, we have Kit Daniel's article, Backdoor Gun Control.
[03:38:39.216 --> 03:38:43.300]  Doctors, not just psychologists, to screen all adults for depression.
[03:38:43.740 --> 03:38:47.183]  Now, you know, you go into the doctor, you know, for whatever reason, you know.
[03:38:47.423 --> 03:38:50.265]  Let's say you break your leg, whatever, and maybe you're a little depressed.
[03:38:50.285 --> 03:38:51.646]  You're a baseball player.
[03:38:51.707 --> 03:38:52.287]  Now you can't play.
[03:38:52.307 --> 03:38:54.128]  So you may be a little bit depressed by that.
[03:38:54.329 --> 03:38:57.511]  That could be a prereq to having your guns taken away.
[03:38:57.591 --> 03:39:00.494]  As farfetched as that sounds, that's actually true now.
[03:39:00.574 --> 03:39:05.538]  If you're a football player, you have the mental issues there with the head trauma.
[03:39:05.558 --> 03:39:06.258]  You get a concussion.
[03:39:06.498 --> 03:39:06.679]  Right.
[03:39:07.259 --> 03:39:10.643]  And it's not just that, we see another article, this is from Kidd as well.
[03:39:11.043 --> 03:39:14.927]  A lawsuit, cops confiscate guns from vet diagnosed with insomnia.
[03:39:15.227 --> 03:39:23.776]  For the most basic, you know, silly things, we've seen people at the VA being discriminated against just because they have somebody help them with their taxes.
[03:39:23.856 --> 03:39:25.158]  You know, they say you're mentally incompetent.
[03:39:25.178 --> 03:39:26.019]  A lot of people have people.
[03:39:27.039 --> 03:39:32.862]  The tax code is really difficult to navigate.
[03:39:33.122 --> 03:39:35.944]  Most tax attorneys don't even know how to navigate the whole thing.
[03:39:36.224 --> 03:39:43.808]  But then we also have Don Salazar's article, City Demands Firearm Applicants Write an Essay Explaining Why They Need a Gun.
[03:39:44.881 --> 03:39:47.803]  So explain to me why you need your rights as a U.S.
[03:39:47.823 --> 03:39:47.964]  citizen.
[03:39:47.984 --> 03:39:52.828]  I want the people in that city to write an essay to me why they feel like violating my Second Amendment.
[03:39:52.868 --> 03:39:55.230]  Why do you think it's okay to violate my Second Amendment right?
[03:39:55.510 --> 03:40:00.074]  And give me that essay and then I'll judge whether or not that's, you know, reasonable grounds.
[03:40:00.114 --> 03:40:01.255]  Because clearly you're going to get an F.
[03:40:02.316 --> 03:40:07.721]  It's completely like yeah, you tell me why you have to violate my rights because somebody may do something someday.
[03:40:08.522 --> 03:40:10.103]  Let's not have constitutional arguments.
[03:40:10.123 --> 03:40:11.645]  Yeah, let's not have that constitutional argument.
[03:40:11.985 --> 03:40:13.627]  Now, Tim, I'm gonna let you on the show.
[03:40:13.667 --> 03:40:16.249]  Tim from California, please do not give us your constitutional argument.
[03:40:16.450 --> 03:40:17.130]  Welcome to the show.
[03:40:19.553 --> 03:40:19.793]  Hey.
[03:40:20.173 --> 03:40:20.354]  Hey.
[03:40:20.454 --> 03:40:21.895]  Oh, wow.
[03:40:22.015 --> 03:40:25.559]  This is totally an honor to be
[03:40:26.403 --> 03:40:26.943]  On the air.
[03:40:28.364 --> 03:40:31.385]  I am part of the resistance.
[03:40:31.605 --> 03:40:34.547]  Been part of the resistance before I knew what that meant.
[03:40:34.667 --> 03:40:34.987]  Alright.
[03:40:35.007 --> 03:40:35.387]  Awesome.
[03:40:35.487 --> 03:40:37.968]  So what's on your mind today?
[03:40:38.028 --> 03:40:43.031]  Just listening to up there in Oregon, what's going on, you know.
[03:40:44.891 --> 03:40:48.853]  To me, my opinion would be it's, they probably did murder the guy.
[03:40:48.893 --> 03:40:52.675]  It's going to be one of those things to create, to take our guns away.
[03:40:53.760 --> 03:40:58.003]  To just impose that martial law and say that us Americans are bad.
[03:40:59.344 --> 03:41:08.712]  And, you know, I see the writing on the wall, and I try to tell all my friends, and I am 100% this show, 100%, all or nothing.
[03:41:08.932 --> 03:41:12.635]  And I do my best to tell everybody, but, you know, I see it for what it is.
[03:41:12.655 --> 03:41:18.279]  You know, our leader will tell us that, oh, we got to take our guns.
[03:41:19.200 --> 03:41:21.842]  And we all know that guns is what keeps us safe from
[03:41:23.012 --> 03:41:25.893]  From everything, and it's just an honor to be on the show.
[03:41:26.553 --> 03:41:27.894]  Oh, thank you, Tim.
[03:41:28.714 --> 03:41:30.374]  It's an honor to talk to you as well.
[03:41:30.574 --> 03:41:36.716]  And the thing about this is, yeah, it undoubtedly is going to be used to like, this is why we need to take away your guns.
[03:41:36.756 --> 03:41:38.877]  This is why we need to have smart guns and all this other stuff.
[03:41:39.197 --> 03:41:44.259]  They will point to this, but the issue is, you know, you have so many other people who use their guns responsibly.
[03:41:44.279 --> 03:41:52.061]  And I'm not, you know, demonizing the people up there in Oregon, but it was always a tinderbox situation that could have easily gone,
[03:41:52.341 --> 03:41:53.983]  Well, that's what we said from day one.
[03:41:54.023 --> 03:41:55.664]  We were like, this is not well thought out.
[03:41:55.744 --> 03:42:04.192]  This isn't, you know, you got, they have good heart, but this isn't the right, this isn't the right time, especially with Obama coming out with his gun control push there with the State of the Union address.
[03:42:05.112 --> 03:42:16.162]  And, you know, I just like to point out that it's really obvious to see how well the divide and conquer has worked within this last year, because if you go on Twitter and social media when this man,
[03:42:17.063 --> 03:42:19.124]  You know, turns out someone was killed.
[03:42:19.724 --> 03:42:21.424]  Everyone's like, yeah, that's what you deserve.
[03:42:21.544 --> 03:42:22.864]  White guy out there with a gun.
[03:42:22.904 --> 03:42:25.205]  If you point a weapon at a Fed, that's what you get.
[03:42:25.965 --> 03:42:30.086]  And first of all, so did your sources tell you that he pointed a weapon?
[03:42:30.186 --> 03:42:34.807]  And then they send me an article and it's like, authorities say this is how it went down.
[03:42:34.827 --> 03:42:38.428]  OK, I'm like, all right, well, sources give me some other sources.
[03:42:38.868 --> 03:42:41.629]  But then it's like you have the same people who are
[03:42:42.529 --> 03:42:44.030]  Wanting people to rally around them.
[03:42:44.050 --> 03:42:59.934]  I just watched a video a guy in Florida was there giving his testimony to the judge And he was like I'm sorry I feared for my life these cops were gonna kill me I feel like they were crooked cops, and this is why I felt like I needed to defend myself And so people you know social justice warriors are rallying around him.
[03:42:59.954 --> 03:43:05.336]  Oh, yeah He's crooked cops or whatever, but then if it's these white guys if they think are just
[03:43:05.976 --> 03:43:06.236]  I don't
[03:43:25.316 --> 03:43:25.796]  That is true.
[03:43:25.816 --> 03:43:29.479]  To educate those people on their Second Amendment rights.
[03:43:29.959 --> 03:43:32.161]  You know, but now it's like the tables have turned.
[03:43:32.301 --> 03:43:37.785]  The race, the divide and conquer, has worked once again to keep us from fighting against the man.
[03:43:38.266 --> 03:43:39.146]  I definitely agree with that.
[03:43:39.186 --> 03:43:44.210]  It keeps you distracted by, you know, various issues that have nothing to do with the people that are at the top level.
[03:43:44.230 --> 03:43:44.711]  I agree with that 100%.
[03:43:45.131 --> 03:43:47.793]  Now let's talk to Eric in West Virginia.
[03:43:48.133 --> 03:43:50.455]  You also have several topics you want to talk about.
[03:43:50.955 --> 03:43:52.797]  Again, for the sake of time, can you pick one?
[03:43:52.837 --> 03:43:54.458]  What is your most important topic, Eric?
[03:43:55.616 --> 03:43:56.637]  I don't know.
[03:44:16.147 --> 03:44:24.435]  With the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, and that the federal government's not supposed to own 30 miles of any property.
[03:44:24.535 --> 03:44:25.877]  That is correct.
[03:44:25.957 --> 03:44:31.322]  Now I didn't, I wasn't, I'm not familiar with that article, but yeah that is true what you say, that they're not supposed to own federal lands.
[03:44:31.342 --> 03:44:34.445]  So you said that was on, oh there it is, CBS News.
[03:44:34.505 --> 03:44:37.448]  Donald Trump don't hand federal lands to states.
[03:44:37.508 --> 03:44:37.768]  Wow.
[03:44:38.008 --> 03:44:40.271]  Yeah that is, in my mind, that's a red flag.
[03:44:41.351 --> 03:44:43.332]  He doesn't understand what's going on out there.
[03:44:43.352 --> 03:44:50.414]  And there's actually a really great article, John Rappaport, I'm going to try and get him on the show this week, I know he's a little tied up, but he poses this question.
[03:44:50.574 --> 03:44:53.035]  Is the Oregon standoff really about uranium?
[03:44:53.476 --> 03:45:00.638]  And talks about how the Clintons had their hands in selling the 20% of the uranium that's produced here in the U.S.
[03:45:00.678 --> 03:45:02.539]  now is in Putin's hands actually.
[03:45:02.899 --> 03:45:07.261]  And of course all of these federal lands, federal land grabs, this is one of the
[03:45:08.081 --> 03:45:12.983]  These mineral rights are one of the big clutches there that have to deal with these federal lands.
[03:45:13.003 --> 03:45:19.486]  Because like I said, they always try to push this narrative that it's we the people's land and they're just the stewards of it.
[03:45:19.646 --> 03:45:20.987]  And no, it's not.
[03:45:21.327 --> 03:45:28.591]  Like we have Harry Reid selling that land there in Nevada, leasing it out to the Chinese so they can put solar farms on it.
[03:45:29.571 --> 03:45:32.294]  Do we get, are we getting a pay cut of that with our electricity bill?
[03:45:32.314 --> 03:45:41.201]  He says you're a domestic terrorist if you go out there and oppose these guys who, and the issue with Harry Reid out there is he's saying these guys are domestic terrorists because they want to protect their cattle.
[03:45:41.502 --> 03:45:46.826]  Meanwhile BLM is shooting the cattle in the head and throwing them in a ditch and saying that they're the ones out there fighting for conservation rights.
[03:45:46.847 --> 03:45:52.011]  Or saying, oh we don't have the food to feed all the turtles that we said we needed to, you know, have as land for desert tortoise.
[03:45:53.072 --> 03:45:54.555]  You know, it's completely ridiculous.
[03:45:54.855 --> 03:45:55.757]  Thank you so much, Eric.
[03:45:56.037 --> 03:45:57.960]  Now, I am going to jump here a little bit.
[03:45:58.000 --> 03:46:00.645]  We see a call from Felicia in Oregon.
[03:46:00.705 --> 03:46:02.708]  She says she is an Oathkeeper member.
[03:46:03.028 --> 03:46:06.114]  So go ahead, Felicia, and tell us your thoughts on the Oregon situation.
[03:46:07.057 --> 03:46:08.358]  Actually, I attend the meetings.
[03:46:08.438 --> 03:46:09.519]  I'm not a formal member.
[03:46:09.539 --> 03:46:10.039]  Okay.
[03:46:10.459 --> 03:46:26.849]  And, um, actually some of the things you guys aren't reporting on is there's a group of like, um, the Pacific Northwest Patriots, the Idaho 3%, and more recently, the Oath Keepers are, have a perimeter around that refuge.
[03:46:27.049 --> 03:46:33.853]  And they've actually had face to face combats with the feds, not combats, but you know, um, talking.
[03:46:34.580 --> 03:46:34.780]  Okay.
[03:46:35.060 --> 03:46:39.963]  Saying that they would protect the people from them and the feds from the people.
[03:46:39.983 --> 03:46:42.104]  And this can be seen online.
[03:46:42.164 --> 03:46:44.345]  It's been recorded by people that were in on it.
[03:46:44.945 --> 03:46:46.146]  And this isn't being reported.
[03:46:46.226 --> 03:46:48.107]  And I'm so afraid for my friends.
[03:46:49.720 --> 03:46:53.543]  Well, do you have, uh, is it on a YouTube page or something else that people could access?
[03:46:53.603 --> 03:46:54.544]  It's on Pete Santilli.
[03:46:54.604 --> 03:46:56.286]  You can pick it up on Pete Santilli.
[03:46:56.426 --> 03:46:58.628]  They had someone in there recording that transaction.
[03:46:58.648 --> 03:47:00.170]  Alright, well thank you so much, Felicia.
[03:47:00.190 --> 03:47:02.492]  Alright, and let's see.
[03:47:02.512 --> 03:47:04.454]  Let's go on to another caller.
[03:47:04.474 --> 03:47:06.916]  We have Zen Girl in Florida.
[03:47:06.936 --> 03:47:08.998]  You want to talk about the debates and also Donald Trump.
[03:47:09.038 --> 03:47:09.319]  Go ahead.
[03:47:11.089 --> 03:47:13.451]  Hey, thank you so much for having me on.
[03:47:13.511 --> 03:47:20.996]  I have been a longtime listener and a devotee of Alex Jones InfoWars and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:47:21.476 --> 03:47:40.830]  Anyway, I'm calling because I feel that even though I like Trump and many of his attributes, he really came out with a stupid statement when he said he could stand in the middle of Times Square and shoot somebody and he would still have all his
[03:47:41.383 --> 03:47:42.003]  Followers.
[03:47:42.023 --> 03:47:47.526]  I think that's a very bad statement to make.
[03:47:47.866 --> 03:47:53.429]  It really sets a precedent of how low he's willing to go.
[03:47:53.449 --> 03:47:56.391]  He just is full of himself.
[03:47:56.651 --> 03:48:03.075]  And don't get me wrong, of everybody up there, he's the only one that I would consider voting for.
[03:48:03.455 --> 03:48:05.716]  But I just thought that was just
[03:48:06.514 --> 03:48:07.215]  Out of line.
[03:48:07.235 --> 03:48:07.935]  Right.
[03:48:08.035 --> 03:48:08.436]  I don't know.
[03:48:08.456 --> 03:48:09.817]  Do you feel the same way?
[03:48:09.857 --> 03:48:10.657]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[03:48:10.697 --> 03:48:16.542]  I think he's definitely known for making some outrageous statements, which the people were really attracted to.
[03:48:16.642 --> 03:48:19.184]  But there is a fine line that you can't cross.
[03:48:19.665 --> 03:48:20.665]  Nobody likes hubris.
[03:48:20.726 --> 03:48:25.049]  Nobody wants to start seeing the Obama smirk in Donald Trump.
[03:48:25.229 --> 03:48:30.013]  Then they're going to just realize, oh, wow, we're just voting for another populist leader here.
[03:48:30.754 --> 03:48:31.454]  So I agree with you.
[03:48:31.494 --> 03:48:34.517]  I think he kind of needs to tone it down a little bit.
[03:48:35.437 --> 03:48:38.359]  You know, if you're going to have that kind of narcissism, I believe.
[03:48:38.379 --> 03:48:40.040]  Well, thank you so much, Zen Girl.
[03:48:40.100 --> 03:48:42.321]  Like I said, I don't agree with everything Trump says.
[03:48:42.341 --> 03:48:44.682]  You know, there's some things I do agree with, some things I do not.
[03:48:45.102 --> 03:48:47.424]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joseph in California.
[03:48:47.464 --> 03:48:49.605]  You also want to talk about the Oregon standoff.
[03:48:49.765 --> 03:48:50.065]  Go ahead.
[03:48:51.926 --> 03:48:52.967]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:48:53.667 --> 03:48:56.108]  Leanne highlighted what I was going to say earlier.
[03:48:56.188 --> 03:48:56.729]  Thanks for that.
[03:48:57.932 --> 03:49:04.625]  When I read about that story on John Rappaport's site, I can't remember the exact name of the company.
[03:49:04.665 --> 03:49:08.913]  It was a Canadian mining company, and it was sold to the Russians.
[03:49:09.777 --> 03:49:16.381]  And I think the deal may have even been brokered through the Clinton Foundation and some Canadian government officials.
[03:49:16.401 --> 03:49:17.141]  I'm not quite sure.
[03:49:17.261 --> 03:49:19.102]  Well, she was the Secretary of State.
[03:49:19.323 --> 03:49:26.427]  She was the Secretary of State who had to authorize that transaction because uranium is a, I mean, that could be a security threat.
[03:49:26.567 --> 03:49:28.248]  So she signed off on the deal.
[03:49:28.368 --> 03:49:28.848]  But go ahead.
[03:49:28.868 --> 03:49:30.509]  Right.
[03:49:30.529 --> 03:49:31.209]  No, thank you for that.
[03:49:31.289 --> 03:49:32.290]  Thank you for that.
[03:49:32.730 --> 03:49:34.011]  Thanks for taking my call on that.
[03:49:34.791 --> 03:49:39.314]  And just piggybacking off of what the previous caller said about Donald Trump.
[03:49:39.844 --> 03:49:49.753]  You know, I have been having some issues with, you know, some of the things that he says and some of the things that he does, but I still do believe that he's the best candidate out of all the candidates out there.
[03:49:49.773 --> 03:49:58.381]  So unfortunately, we've just been placed in a situation where we've got to pick from, you know, the best, worst things, even with regard to our
[03:49:59.048 --> 03:50:10.241]  country, you know, whether it's at a local level, a state level, a federal level, everything's so entangled, all the corruption, you're just forced to pick the best out of the worst situations.
[03:50:10.361 --> 03:50:12.784]  Yeah, you're trying to pick the lesser of two evils.
[03:50:12.804 --> 03:50:13.845]  Thank you so much, Joe.
[03:50:13.985 --> 03:50:14.385]  I agree with you.
[03:50:14.425 --> 03:50:20.371]  And then if you think about it, the CBS News just released an article entitled, Americans hate the U.S.
[03:50:20.411 --> 03:50:21.852]  government more than ever.
[03:50:22.292 --> 03:50:22.873]  And it's true.
[03:50:22.893 --> 03:50:23.894]  I mean, you see the polls.
[03:50:24.014 --> 03:50:27.017]  It's just historical lows on trust.
[03:50:27.597 --> 03:50:28.678]  We don't think they're competent.
[03:50:28.978 --> 03:50:32.462]  And yet, all of a sudden, we're getting these calls for a constitutional convention.
[03:50:32.522 --> 03:50:33.262]  Let's amend.
[03:50:33.643 --> 03:50:35.024]  We don't want you touching anything.
[03:50:35.104 --> 03:50:35.845]  Nobody trusts you.
[03:50:37.176 --> 03:50:40.299]  Alright, real quick, I'm going to try to jam in Jerry in Florida.
[03:50:40.319 --> 03:50:42.261]  You actually want to talk about a constitutional convention.
[03:50:42.822 --> 03:50:43.522]  Very quickly, sir.
[03:50:43.943 --> 03:50:44.183]  Yes.
[03:50:45.424 --> 03:50:50.529]  Yeah, listen, that thought actually scares me to death, but a virtual one, I guess, isn't so bad.
[03:50:50.569 --> 03:50:55.254]  The problem is that I think that one of the people that's selling it is pretty misinformed.
[03:50:55.294 --> 03:50:57.036]  Yesterday, when he was talking to Alex,
[03:50:57.944 --> 03:51:02.029]  You said that one of his compatriots, Mark Levine... Hold on, hold on to that thought.
[03:51:02.049 --> 03:51:03.250]  We'll come back to you after this break.
[03:51:03.270 --> 03:51:04.091]  We'll let you finish up.
[03:51:04.131 --> 03:51:04.632]  Stay tuned.
[03:51:04.652 --> 03:51:07.295]  This is Jakari Jackson in the InfoWars Command Center.
[03:51:07.315 --> 03:51:08.697]  We'll be back right after this break.
[03:51:09.718 --> 03:51:17.707]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:18.408 --> 03:51:19.109]  What did I do?
[03:51:19.129 --> 03:51:27.196]  I created Extendivite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.
[03:51:27.817 --> 03:51:36.304]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you so you don't have to suffer the same thing I did.

[03:54:16.276 --> 03:54:21.762]  Before we finish up with our callers, we want to remind you about a special at InfoWarsShop.com.

[03:54:53.022 --> 03:54:57.906]  CoQ10 is essential for basic cell function and is a primary building block of life.

[03:55:03.110 --> 03:55:06.273]  Now with the time we have, we're going to finish up with our caller Jerry.
[03:55:06.693 --> 03:55:10.716]  You're speaking about a virtual constitutional convention.
[03:55:10.776 --> 03:55:12.538]  Go ahead and finish your thoughts on that.
[03:55:13.905 --> 03:55:15.806]  Yeah, I'll try to be real quick about this.
[03:55:15.906 --> 03:55:20.189]  I'm just real concerned with all the stuff of provocateurs and everything.
[03:55:20.229 --> 03:55:27.673]  And the guy that was on yesterday had mentioned, called a guy named Mark Levine, one of Alex Jones's compatriots.
[03:55:28.333 --> 03:55:32.416]  This is a guy that said he wanted Netanyahu to be our president in 2013.
[03:55:32.456 --> 03:55:35.037]  He's called Lew Rockwell anti-Semitic.
[03:55:35.137 --> 03:55:37.419]  He's called Ron Paul a racist.
[03:55:37.439 --> 03:55:39.640]  He called Tom Woods a neo-Confederate.
[03:55:40.380 --> 03:55:49.887]  I'm just thinking that, you know, I just worry about a guy that says, you know, we should have this great, you know, virtual constitutional convention and this is the guy, one of the head guys we should invite.
[03:55:50.618 --> 03:55:59.643]  Yeah, I do agree with, when you talk about the Constitutional Convention, like I've heard David Knight say, it's not an issue with the Constitution, it's an issue getting people to follow the Constitution.
[03:55:59.663 --> 03:56:05.786]  You can add anything else you want to it, but if they won't follow the Bill of Rights, you know, you can add whatever, it doesn't mean it's going to be followed.
[03:56:05.986 --> 03:56:07.787]  I agree with that statement there, Jerry.
[03:56:08.628 --> 03:56:14.251]  Alright, let's move on now to, it's been holding the longest, Stephen in Florida, you want to talk about Trump.
[03:56:14.391 --> 03:56:14.691]  Go ahead.
[03:56:16.184 --> 03:56:18.886]  Yeah, good afternoon Leanne and Jakari.
[03:56:19.227 --> 03:56:20.287]  Here's what I want to say.
[03:56:20.327 --> 03:56:22.970]  I brought this up to Alex months ago.
[03:56:24.010 --> 03:56:27.033]  You know, there's a few issues.
[03:56:27.053 --> 03:56:36.721]  A couple of them have been mentioned on InfoWars, but one's not really being talked about by Alex or anybody else as far as Trump's concerned.
[03:56:36.741 --> 03:56:44.507]  Now, the issues about, I remember early on Alex was saying he had a problem with Trump because of his connection with casinos.
[03:56:45.362 --> 03:56:55.608]  And I have a major problem with that, too, because it's well known that usually those are run by organized crime and they cause poverty and a lot of other problems, and it's just not a good thing.
[03:56:56.529 --> 03:57:06.274]  Also, the issue of eminent domain, how Trump has used that to legally steal people's property, and that's a fact, and I wish he would have confronted him about that when he had him on his show.
[03:57:06.674 --> 03:57:14.419]  But the main thing I want to say, as a Christian, that I have a problem with Trump about is the fact that this man is an adulterer.
[03:57:15.214 --> 03:57:27.425]  And therefore, if his wife cannot trust him, how can I, as a voter and an American citizen, and like a pastor I heard say a long time ago, it's not the economy, stupid.
[03:57:27.785 --> 03:57:28.886]  It's about character.
[03:57:29.326 --> 03:57:31.408]  And that is what Donald Trump is lacking.
[03:57:31.448 --> 03:57:35.812]  I think he's a showman, even though he's got a lot of good things to say, but still
[03:57:36.545 --> 03:57:56.304]  I think he's really capitalizing on this whole thing, even though he has some definite interest about America, for his own personal interest, because the man is an egotist, and the fact that he has no shame whatsoever in what he's done with his family situation, to me, speaks volumes more than anything else he has to say that's good.
[03:57:56.624 --> 03:57:57.546]  Thank you so much, Stephen.
[03:57:57.566 --> 03:57:59.428]  Yeah, like I said, I'm not on Team Trump.
[03:57:59.789 --> 03:58:01.291]  I have my issues with them as well.
[03:58:01.331 --> 03:58:04.236]  I'm sure anybody could list a few things they don't like about them.
[03:58:04.857 --> 03:58:06.960]  Real quick, we're going to go to our last caller.

[03:58:11.066 --> 03:58:11.347]  Go ahead.
[03:58:12.851 --> 03:58:21.993]  Hi, I listened to you guys show for a while, and if we're starting the Oregon standoff, do you guys think they should stand down and just follow the cops' orders?
[03:58:22.133 --> 03:58:27.795]  Because that's what everyone said that... Well, I mean, I wouldn't have showed up there in the first place, personally.
[03:58:27.815 --> 03:58:31.396]  You know, you're showing up to a situation where you're not being asked to assist.
[03:58:31.836 --> 03:58:40.758]  Once again, you know, I'm a supporter of, you know, the right to gather, the right to bear arms and all that stuff, but it wasn't the time or place because they just really weren't invited there in the first place.
[03:58:40.778 --> 03:58:41.338]  Thank you so much.
