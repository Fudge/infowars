[00:00:10.931 --> 00:00:11.532]  Is the U.S.
[00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:20.880]  involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling, anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?
[00:00:23.882 --> 00:00:24.603]  To Turkey?
[00:00:26.304 --> 00:00:27.626]  It is a big idea.
[00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:29.833]  A new world order.
[00:00:30.353 --> 00:00:34.016]  How is it that this organization is so well-funded, so organized?
[00:00:34.096 --> 00:00:41.202]  Islamic State-linked militants have gained a stronger foothold in Libya, seizing new economically vital areas of the country.
[00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:49.589]  The leader of ISIS in Libya is none other than Abdel Hakim al-Hajj, and of course he was armed to the teeth by NATO.
[00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:53.790]  In a world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.372]  The Russians say they're negotiating with North Korea to hold joint military exercises.
[00:00:58.572 --> 00:01:03.994]  Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin teaming up, creating an ominous alliance against the United States.
[00:01:05.034 --> 00:01:09.955]  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal that the U.S.
[00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:12.176]  government is negotiating with Iran.
[00:01:12.336 --> 00:01:17.458]  Saudi Arabia is apparently prepared to allow Israeli jets into its airspace to conduct attacks on Iran.
[00:01:18.018 --> 00:01:22.402]  We have an unprecedented opportunity to build a new world order.
[00:01:22.922 --> 00:01:29.047]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine and played an important part in events now.
[00:01:29.247 --> 00:01:33.591]  Ukraine is set to receive the first tranche of an international monetary fund aid package.
[00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:37.935]  We had brokered a deal to transition power in Ukraine.
[00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:40.157]  Vladimir Putin is on the move.
[00:01:42.506 --> 00:01:53.195]  Only when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full measure of the opportunities presented by this new and involving world order.
[00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:55.696]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:01:56.377 --> 00:01:58.579]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:02:17.176 --> 00:02:17.736]  Hi, Mr. Eagle?
[00:02:17.756 --> 00:02:17.897]  Okay.
[00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:24.722]  You want to talk to us?
[00:02:26.703 --> 00:02:26.903]  Really?
[00:02:26.923 --> 00:02:28.044]  You don't want to talk to us at all?
[00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:29.966]  People are concerned the election's going to be rigged.
[00:02:30.026 --> 00:02:32.528]  I guess they're really going to be concerned when they see you turn your back on us.
[00:02:32.908 --> 00:02:35.030]  Yeah.
[00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.250]  Well, can I talk to him?
[00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:37.692]  Will anybody here talk to us?
[00:02:38.552 --> 00:02:39.413]  Or do you want to rig this?
[00:02:40.614 --> 00:02:43.096]  Why are you cutting off all these audit trails?
[00:02:44.317 --> 00:02:45.878]  Why are you cutting down the paper audit trails?
[00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:49.270]  Well, there you go.
[00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.032]  That should tell you something.
[00:02:51.052 --> 00:02:53.074]  People concerned about elections being rigged?
[00:02:53.474 --> 00:02:57.439]  You've got the Director of Elections here at the Secretary of State office that won't talk to us.
[00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.002]  Takes one look at the press and turns around and walks off.
[00:03:05.376 --> 00:03:06.837]  David Knight for Infowars.com.
[00:03:06.877 --> 00:03:11.141]  We're here in Austin, Texas at the Capitol at the Secretary of State office.
[00:03:11.181 --> 00:03:21.629]  We want to ask the Director of Elections why there have been so many orders to countervene the law that would give us an audit trail for electronic voting machines.
[00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:27.837]  We all are concerned about knowing whether or not we're going to have honest elections, the integrity of the elections.
[00:03:28.097 --> 00:03:37.149]  And yet we've seen time and time again that the director here of elections has judged in favor of the vendors rather than in favor of integrity.
[00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:42.932]  If the vendors' machines that he wants to buy don't conform to the election law, they change the election law.
[00:03:42.952 --> 00:03:54.659]  So we want to ask him why he's shutting down paper trails at the different precincts, why they are turning away monitors at the elections, and other issues about electronic voting that many people are concerned about.
[00:03:54.679 --> 00:04:02.263]  It is a nationwide concern, and we're going to ask him what he can tell us to reassure voters that these elections are not rigged.
[00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:19.345]  Hi, Mr. Eagle?
[00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:20.786]  Yeah.
[00:04:21.506 --> 00:04:21.766]  Okay.
[00:04:22.086 --> 00:04:22.927]  You don't want to talk to us?
[00:04:24.908 --> 00:04:25.149]  Really?
[00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.249]  You don't want to talk to us at all?
[00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:28.191]  People are concerned the election's going to be rigged.
[00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:30.752]  I guess they're really going to be concerned when they see you turn your back on us.
[00:04:31.153 --> 00:04:33.254]  Yeah.
[00:04:33.514 --> 00:04:34.455]  Well, can I talk to him?
[00:04:34.735 --> 00:04:35.896]  Will anybody here talk to us?
[00:04:36.756 --> 00:04:37.637]  Or do you want to rig this?
[00:04:38.838 --> 00:04:41.300]  Why are you cutting off all these audit trails?
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.081]  Why are you cutting down the paper audit trails?
[00:04:46.903 --> 00:04:47.464]  Well, there you go.
[00:04:48.297 --> 00:04:49.238]  That should tell you something.
[00:04:49.278 --> 00:04:51.279]  People concerned about elections being rigged?
[00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:55.661]  You've got the Director of Elections here at the Secretary of State Office that won't talk to us.
[00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:58.243]  Takes one look at the press and turns around and walks off.
[00:04:58.883 --> 00:05:00.164]  That should tell you a great deal.
[00:05:00.204 --> 00:05:01.805]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:05:09.574 --> 00:05:18.839]  They're a real anti-feeling globally right now against this whole idea of a world government, no accountability, and the British led the way on that.
[00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:27.684]  General Dover being the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, we have to understand a no-fly zone at this point in time would do nothing to help secure the situation and would likely lead to another war.
[00:05:29.165 --> 00:05:33.906]  The biggest threat right now, globally, is not Islamic terror, it's actually the Russians.
[00:05:33.986 --> 00:05:37.326]  No one has a plan for Syria, and the plans that have been put forth by Ms.
[00:05:37.346 --> 00:05:43.808]  Clinton on her side are really dangerous and really designed to do damage to our national security.
[00:05:44.568 --> 00:05:52.069]  She wants to continue this unabated import of Islamist terror, like they did in Germany and France.
[00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:56.530]  And that policy is not only dangerous, it is guaranteed to see more U.S.
[00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.390]  citizens die.
[00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.813]  What's happened in Europe and that would come here.
[00:06:01.094 --> 00:06:04.559]  She wants to knowingly import the problems we have in Europe.
[00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:11.508]  And the reason you would do that is because you can both be the provider of the crisis and the provider of the solution to the crisis.
[00:06:11.568 --> 00:06:14.413]  Of course, their solution, Alex, as you know, is more control.
[00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:16.274]  I don't know.
[00:06:35.092 --> 00:06:35.953]  I'm a political scientist.
[00:06:35.993 --> 00:06:37.275]  I know exactly what they're trying to do.
[00:06:37.675 --> 00:06:42.440]  They're trying to create adverse circumstances that they then can come in and solve.
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.206]  This is a global version of the Munchausen by proxy treatment of psychosis.
[00:06:48.587 --> 00:06:54.213]  So basically, she's trying to basically be, you know, be the parent who injures their own child for purposes of going in to be the hero.
[00:06:54.533 --> 00:06:56.856]  That's what they're doing, except their purpose long-term, Alex,
[00:06:57.396 --> 00:06:58.096]  We're good to go.
[00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:26.672]  That no matter how you feel about Trump, and, you know, he's gone back and forth on some issues, I sincerely believe that Ms.
[00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:38.624]  Clinton will do exactly what she said regarding open borders, regarding attempting to gain control and prevent normal, you know, legitimate citizens having legitimate rights to have weapons from having them.
[00:07:38.744 --> 00:07:39.985]  And there's nothing else I agree with Ms.
[00:07:40.025 --> 00:07:40.525]  Trump on.
[00:07:40.846 --> 00:07:41.847]  If you look at her record,
[00:07:42.627 --> 00:07:45.408]  Uh, you know, you look at her 30 years of service, yeah, all of it's bad.
[00:07:45.468 --> 00:07:46.448]  All of it's failure.
[00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:53.591]  And I don't think anybody can look at her record and actually find something that's been successful for the American people.
[00:07:54.071 --> 00:08:00.453]  And the only thing she's done, Alex, if you look at it, she's created havoc and chaos in every possible way.
[00:08:00.493 --> 00:08:01.753]  For her own gain.
[00:08:01.973 --> 00:08:02.194]  Right.
[00:08:02.494 --> 00:08:05.335]  So, for personal gain, which is very clearly they have.
[00:08:05.375 --> 00:08:07.815]  So you have to ask yourself, who is Ms.
[00:08:07.855 --> 00:08:09.276]  Clinton really trying to help?
[00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.950]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:27.951]  Because there is a war on your mind.
[00:08:34.933 --> 00:08:35.653]  Oh my gosh!
[00:08:35.753 --> 00:08:37.673]  It's big breaking national news!
[00:08:38.354 --> 00:08:40.494]  The New York Times might get a Pulitzer Prize!
[00:08:41.234 --> 00:08:45.275]  AT&T is paid by the NSA to spy on you!
[00:08:45.295 --> 00:08:47.536]  Of course, we broke that in 1996.
[00:08:49.471 --> 00:08:50.512]  Like I said, we broke it.
[00:08:50.792 --> 00:09:03.821]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that they would spend up to $5 billion a year paying the telecoms to set up the spy hubs for the NSA and pass all your data through it.
[00:09:03.861 --> 00:09:10.546]  Now it ended up being closer to $10 billion a year by the time that the act was fully implemented under law October 1st, 2001.
[00:09:10.907 --> 00:09:11.547]  Statutorily.
[00:09:11.707 --> 00:09:13.208]  One month after 9-11.
[00:09:18.902 --> 00:09:35.451]  They had it scripted five years before to have it statutorily be in place, the entire grid, one month after 9-11, right when they magically passed all the accompanying legislation to make it legal.
[00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:37.893]  You know what that is?
[00:09:37.993 --> 00:09:41.275]  It's called continuity of agenda, continuity of purpose.
[00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:46.798]  It's how the big telecoms can communicate with each other all around the world.
[00:09:47.557 --> 00:09:53.679]  When you read the big white papers, you learn that they are building a planet that will not need people.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.041]  Why the future doesn't need us is the term they most often use.
[00:09:59.782 --> 00:10:02.483]  Where humans are obsolete, obsolescent.
[00:10:04.424 --> 00:10:07.265]  The final technotronic, technocrat dream.
[00:10:09.185 --> 00:10:15.388]  And so I've got big stacks of news here in front of me where men, no matter what color you are,
[00:10:16.914 --> 00:10:20.858]  Are at record numbers out of the workforce at a level higher than the Great Depression.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:31.188]  And that ties into Anheuser-Busch has had the first autonomous 18-wheeler delivery of cold beer in Colorado.
[00:10:31.208 --> 00:10:34.971]  And it's being hailed as the greatest thing ever.
[00:10:35.852 --> 00:10:38.154]  Self-driving truck's first mission, a beer run.
[00:10:38.655 --> 00:10:39.636]  Isn't that just special?
[00:10:40.937 --> 00:10:41.798]  That ties in
[00:10:43.933 --> 00:10:45.954]  But the fact that this isn't innovation.
[00:10:46.094 --> 00:10:53.957]  An economy is being built worldwide that ends the human species as we know it, and that is the officialdom plan.
[00:10:56.458 --> 00:11:07.442]  But it doesn't matter to pseudo-intellectuals like John Ronson, the journalist, who talks about how I am the... What's the quote?
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:21.984]  I am the most, because I was just reading this last night, most reckless person in the world.
[00:11:26.147 --> 00:11:29.189]  The most out of control.
[00:11:32.851 --> 00:11:42.917]  And I just sit back and I'm out of control because I talked to NSA whistleblowers in 1996 and they pointed out how the whole system worked.
[00:11:43.851 --> 00:12:01.064]  And we've been proven right and so I'm bad again because it's scary to the people that have bet on the system and who believe that the establishment's on their side because I'm exposing to them that it's all a fantasy land.
[00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:10.752]  Obamacare
[00:12:12.349 --> 00:12:21.237]  We're now learning, according to Obama, he told us, you can bet it's gonna be a lot higher, is going to boost the average premium, including that of poor people, 25%.
[00:12:22.838 --> 00:12:30.305]  And of course, we've already seen massive premium increases.
[00:12:31.105 --> 00:12:36.190]  And then of course we have the Hillary Rodham Clinton emails,
[00:12:37.503 --> 00:12:40.865]  Where she says, I want it to go bankrupt, then we'll have a single payer.
[00:12:40.905 --> 00:12:42.806]  Well, we always told you that was the plan.
[00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:49.349]  In fact, they were so arrogant, they would simultaneously say we were conspiracy theorists, or racist, or a combination of both.
[00:12:50.349 --> 00:13:01.475]  But then Ezekiel Emanuel would go on television, on Fox, I've played it in other channels, and say, of course we're trying to bankrupt healthcare and bring in a single payer.
[00:13:03.695 --> 00:13:06.256]  But it isn't some utopian communist single-payer.
[00:13:07.196 --> 00:13:15.820]  It's big mega-corporations that will basically make you go to them and work through their system at prices even higher than what you're seeing now.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.261]  It is a looting.
[00:13:19.822 --> 00:13:29.666]  But because Obama goes on the entertainment shows and acts like he's your little buddy, a lot of these people, like, have childlike minds and they really believe that Obama is their friend and out to help them.
[00:13:31.684 --> 00:13:41.128]  Despite the fact that it's in all of the emails that they are deceiving us.
[00:13:42.128 --> 00:13:53.793]  Just like it was in Data Dump 16 on Podesta's emails that we're going to work with the entire press and the entire polling industry to oversample for Hillary.
[00:13:55.373 --> 00:13:58.835]  We want to get ahead of this early and have her dominate right through the election.
[00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:09.293]  Now, we don't need the Podesta email to see unparalleled fraud by the polling industry as a whole.
[00:14:12.994 --> 00:14:18.935]  And the way the polling industry works, if they don't like you, they won't even conduct a poll the way you want it, or they won't even do it fairly.
[00:14:22.717 --> 00:14:27.378]  Ten years ago, I did quite a bit of polling because it became a way to make points in the news.
[00:14:28.922 --> 00:14:40.809]  And I would call up Reuters and Gallup and others and I would talk to them and they would come back about a day later with the pollster or a manager and say, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.971]  We will not give you our services.
[00:14:45.292 --> 00:14:47.253]  And I said, well, you're not a conspiracy theorist.
[00:14:47.273 --> 00:14:48.714]  I understand you control reality.
[00:14:48.734 --> 00:14:50.475]  You decide what's real and what isn't.
[00:14:50.955 --> 00:14:53.297]  So how about you even set up the poll for me?
[00:14:53.837 --> 00:14:54.758]  I'm sure you'll do it fair.
[00:14:55.178 --> 00:14:56.038]  Show me the methodology.
[00:14:56.098 --> 00:14:56.459]  They're like, no.
[00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:10.515]  In fact, I don't remember the actual numbers, but I want to say that I would go through maybe 10 polling companies before I'd find one that would even do our poll.
[00:15:15.818 --> 00:15:16.578]  Now you think about that.
[00:15:17.479 --> 00:15:21.401]  And I was ready to spend $10,000, $15,000, you name it, on a real poll sampling thousands of people.
[00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:21.781]  Wouldn't do it.
[00:15:30.816 --> 00:15:33.158]  So, look, if Donald Trump was really behind, I'd tell you that.
[00:15:33.638 --> 00:15:33.999]  He's not.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:40.624]  Donald Trump, depending on which battleground state you're in, those are the ones that matter, are 5, 10, 15 points ahead.
[00:15:43.747 --> 00:15:50.953]  And that's why you've got Washington Post polls that show Hillary 12 points ahead of him, and you've got CNN polls that show her 25 points ahead.
[00:15:53.776 --> 00:15:56.077]  It's because they're not
[00:15:57.208 --> 00:15:59.429]  Sampling as many Republicans as they do Democrats.
[00:15:59.809 --> 00:16:00.309]  It's that simple.
[00:16:00.849 --> 00:16:05.551]  A lot of times they'll have Hillary Clinton in an ABC News poll we covered yesterday, 12 points ahead in Florida.
[00:16:05.891 --> 00:16:11.434]  Do you know how much they oversampled Democrats in the poll?
[00:16:11.774 --> 00:16:11.434]  12%.
[00:16:12.234 --> 00:16:17.016]  Now that would have them in a dead heat in Florida, until you look at all the Independent, and that's where they really hide the fraud.
[00:16:17.036 --> 00:16:22.638]  Because you don't know who they're really polling there, but that's where they, in the past, have been caught engaging in the fraud.
[00:16:24.428 --> 00:16:33.973]  But they'll argue, hey, you signed a contract with us, we're a polling company, we conduct it the way we want, with our science and our methodology, and then you just accept it.
[00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:42.858]  Kind of like you get a Dallas Cowboys ticket, you know, right on the 50-yard line, and it says on the back of the ticket, this is for entertainment purposes, this game isn't even real.
[00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:47.320]  And you're not even guaranteed that there'll even be a game.
[00:16:48.641 --> 00:16:49.502]  You waive all your rights.
[00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.693]  And that's the thing about vaccines or NFL tickets or any of it.
[00:16:54.033 --> 00:16:55.395]  They don't want you to read the fine print.
[00:16:55.775 --> 00:16:56.316]  Well, guess what?
[00:16:56.616 --> 00:16:57.857]  Infowars read the fine print.
[00:17:03.082 --> 00:17:06.706]  And we have a very corrupt elite in this country that back dictators all over the world.
[00:17:06.766 --> 00:17:07.726]  Now, why is that important?
[00:17:08.067 --> 00:17:16.455]  They'll back a dictator, communist, socialist, fascist, they don't care, over an elected government that's even pro-America because they don't want people to be self-determined.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.662]  And the very same elites that don't want other countries to be free, they don't want us to be free.
[00:17:22.123 --> 00:17:25.745]  So you can bet whatever they're promoting, whatever they're pushing is about globalism.
[00:17:26.285 --> 00:17:39.513]  I have a stack of articles and videos today of illegals recruited by the Democratic Party openly to knock on doors and to basically tell immigrant groups how to go vote.
[00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:52.797]  Now can you imagine if in China, where they don't even have voting, or Mexico, if there were people going around beating on doors, who weren't citizens, saying this is how you should vote, the Mexicans would kill you.
[00:17:53.818 --> 00:17:55.419]  Because that's just normal nationalism.
[00:17:55.439 --> 00:17:57.220]  Despite all their problems, they would attack you.
[00:17:58.428 --> 00:18:03.472]  Only in America do we have stuff like this rubbed in, but then it gets more fun.
[00:18:04.132 --> 00:18:16.481]  It's now back in the news that the security force of the private corporation that founded modern Europe under the Marshall Plan, the OECD, that is the root of the world government.
[00:18:16.741 --> 00:18:17.261]  That's it.
[00:18:17.721 --> 00:18:18.962]  The robber barons in 1945 set up the OECD.
[00:18:22.193 --> 00:18:23.414]  They did the reconstruction of Europe.
[00:18:23.934 --> 00:18:25.555]  Europe's never gotten out from under its control.
[00:18:25.795 --> 00:18:27.656]  That's why the EU was put in place without voting.
[00:18:28.696 --> 00:18:29.477]  It's a dictatorship.
[00:18:30.337 --> 00:18:34.059]  They have voting, but the ministers aren't in control.
[00:18:34.599 --> 00:18:43.644]  That's why they've had four Goldman Sachs presidents appointed as presidents and prime ministers in Europe, in places like Greece and Italy, just in the last few years.
[00:18:43.704 --> 00:18:49.507]  I mean, and then they're in the news saying, it's a new form of government, technocracy, where you don't elect your leaders.
[00:18:50.367 --> 00:18:51.608]  They say it openly.
[00:18:52.728 --> 00:19:00.271]  And I'll sit there with some journalist who begs for an interview and promises and swears it's not a hit piece, and then I'll tell them this stuff and show them quotes and their eyes glaze over.
[00:19:01.532 --> 00:19:05.534]  And so that's back in the news today, that we have all these foreign observers here.
[00:19:06.234 --> 00:19:19.480]  With the Feds, making sure Trump and the Russians don't steal it, but then again, we live in la-la land, there's no such thing as fraud, it's insane, doesn't exist, but Russian takeover of the election is imminent, oh my God, thank goodness,
[00:19:20.253 --> 00:19:32.105]  The security force of the OECD, that's like the Pinkerton Railroad men of Europe, they're here to run our election.
[00:19:33.987 --> 00:19:35.548]  And Homeland Security is federalizing it.
[00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:37.090]  It's a setup.
[00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:37.350]  U.S.
[00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:42.055]  officials warn that Russians will undermine elections with fake documents showing voter fraud.
[00:19:43.117 --> 00:19:44.357]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:44.377 --> 00:19:50.920]  There's no voter fraud, even though it's on local radio and WAI that the machines are all turning off and votes are flipping and we have all these witnesses and our story's on drudge.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.300]  None of that's happening.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.460]  There's never a problem.
[00:19:54.081 --> 00:19:56.141]  Hell, they might even take Texas and just give it to Hillary.
[00:19:56.341 --> 00:19:57.442]  They might give her all 50 states.
[00:19:57.462 --> 00:19:59.222]  Why not give her 100% of the vote?
[00:19:59.983 --> 00:20:00.203]  Hell, 200%.
[00:20:00.343 --> 00:20:04.384]  I mean, we've already got the emails where they admit they're stealing the election.
[00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:07.345]  They just hope the public doesn't see that.
[00:20:10.157 --> 00:20:14.041]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.

[00:24:37.406 --> 00:24:40.507]  Bottom line, they are getting ready to steal this election big time.
[00:24:40.527 --> 00:24:41.767]  We're 13 days out.
[00:24:41.787 --> 00:24:45.689]  14, if you go by Fox's numbers, they count the day of the election.
[00:24:45.709 --> 00:24:49.430]  November 8th is another day, so... I mean, I guess in a way they're right.
[00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:50.571]  It's like 14 days.
[00:24:51.411 --> 00:24:56.693]  It'll be 14 days until we're really knowing how the voting's going.
[00:24:57.915 --> 00:25:05.303]  They tried to put out this big hoax in every major publication out there in the last month that, well, when early voting comes in, it's going to show Hillary clearly dominating.
[00:25:05.764 --> 00:25:12.170]  And that hasn't happened yet, despite all their ballot stuffing and busing people around to vote over and over again that's on record.
[00:25:12.967 --> 00:25:16.488]  We have it from the top election officials, the head of the New York elections.
[00:25:16.528 --> 00:25:18.309]  We have it from the people actually stealing the election.
[00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:20.309]  Then we have the emails about stealing the election.
[00:25:20.329 --> 00:25:22.510]  And then we have the emails about faking the polls.
[00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:29.092]  We have the emails about keeping the public dumb and making us poor and bankrupting the healthcare system to screw us even more.
[00:25:29.112 --> 00:25:30.332]  See, that's the thing.
[00:25:30.733 --> 00:25:35.314]  It's always get you in a worse position than preside over the crisis and get more power.
[00:25:36.634 --> 00:25:37.635]  That's what's so frustrating.
[00:25:37.655 --> 00:25:41.176]  And they have all these pseudo-intellectuals and followers and cowards.
[00:25:44.465 --> 00:25:47.286]  Let's sit there and preside over the destruction of this nation.
[00:25:48.587 --> 00:25:51.668]  And they all just go along with it because they're not innovative.
[00:25:51.688 --> 00:25:52.929]  They can't build their own system.
[00:25:53.349 --> 00:25:55.830]  All they know how to do is say, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:02.472]  And all our corrupt leaders can do is say, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, the Communist Chinese and every other evil organization.
[00:26:03.573 --> 00:26:06.034]  Until there is no bottom to how far we could fall.
[00:26:09.011 --> 00:26:17.015]  I know, starting three years ago, my parents got kicked off their insurance they'd had for 30 years, that they never even used, and it doubled in prices.
[00:26:17.215 --> 00:26:17.935]  And then it tripled.
[00:26:17.975 --> 00:26:28.240]  And then everybody else right down the line, including people that are right above the poverty line, are getting the fines, up to $5,000 a year for not having it.
[00:26:28.721 --> 00:26:29.801]  And the employers are getting it.
[00:26:29.861 --> 00:26:33.463]  And you go in to try to get the insurance.
[00:26:35.299 --> 00:26:38.401]  Because thanks to Obamacare, GCN had insurance for some people.
[00:26:38.481 --> 00:26:40.242]  I had it there for like 18 years.
[00:26:40.883 --> 00:26:41.363]  Got rid of it.
[00:26:41.703 --> 00:26:44.385]  So I went out and got my own insurance and it was way higher.
[00:26:44.725 --> 00:26:46.847]  And now they're telling me in letters it's gonna go up more.
[00:26:47.227 --> 00:26:49.108]  And so I've gone out and shopped around.
[00:26:50.569 --> 00:26:52.891]  And no matter what I do, I'm gonna pay a lot more.
[00:26:58.454 --> 00:27:03.918]  It's the gullibility of the Democrat voter
[00:27:05.296 --> 00:27:08.198]  Lord knows the Republicans are gullible as well, but the Democrats are a whole other animal.
[00:27:09.879 --> 00:27:18.984]  I've told the story many times, but used to I would go swim almost every day when it was warm enough at one of the biggest freshwater pools in this country called Barton Springs in downtown Austin.
[00:27:21.446 --> 00:27:25.228]  Everybody knew who I was out there, and they have a lot of lifeguards, sometimes as many as 20 on duty.
[00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:31.952]  And right before Obamacare was being rammed through,
[00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.292]  I was in the paper and stuff, fighting it.
[00:27:35.812 --> 00:27:40.156]  It was how I was so racist and evil because this was a black man and I didn't want him to succeed.
[00:27:40.176 --> 00:27:41.377]  I mean, this is just crazy talk.
[00:27:44.099 --> 00:27:49.504]  And I remember the people that worked there started getting grumpy towards me and not talking to me, which was fine.
[00:27:51.225 --> 00:28:00.573]  And then as soon as Obamacare went through and they all got cut to part-time and they didn't get the free health care they'd been promised, they all, I mean, when I say all, I mean dozens of people came over.
[00:28:01.519 --> 00:28:02.759]  And apologize to me.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.540]  Including city workers that would go there and swim.
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.700]  It's like the government hangout.
[00:28:08.701 --> 00:28:10.281]  And go, my God, I'm being cut.
[00:28:11.241 --> 00:28:12.182]  My prices are going up.
[00:28:12.242 --> 00:28:21.404]  And then, I don't really go to the hospital, but if I get an infection, or I think I pull a muscle, I go to one of these clinics.
[00:28:21.424 --> 00:28:23.664]  I've been going to the same one for 20 years.
[00:28:24.645 --> 00:28:28.425]  Because I know the doctors and people that work there, and their listeners.
[00:28:29.086 --> 00:28:30.286]  And I'll sit there in the waiting room,
[00:28:32.261 --> 00:28:34.182]  Probably an hour, like you do sometimes when you go to a clinic.
[00:28:34.642 --> 00:28:36.463]  And I watch all these old women go up to the counter.
[00:28:37.784 --> 00:28:41.505]  For some reason, the first time I went in right after Obamacare went in, it was mainly old black women.
[00:28:41.745 --> 00:28:43.266]  For whatever reason we're in this clinic, I was going to.
[00:28:43.846 --> 00:28:46.328]  They'd walk over and they'd be getting their checkup or getting their medicine.
[00:28:46.348 --> 00:28:48.649]  They'd be like, but that's not right, it used to be.
[00:28:49.744 --> 00:28:50.865]  It used to be $40, now it's $180.
[00:28:50.965 --> 00:28:53.447]  And they'd be whispering, they'd be, why?
[00:28:53.647 --> 00:28:55.608]  And I'd be turning the TV down so I could listen.
[00:28:55.628 --> 00:28:56.889]  And they'd be, why?
[00:28:57.369 --> 00:28:59.351]  And they'd say, we're sorry, ma'am, it's the Affordable Care Act.
[00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:01.692]  It's not us, it's just what it is now.
[00:29:02.293 --> 00:29:03.533]  That's gonna hurt me.
[00:29:05.595 --> 00:29:06.936]  And who was really hurting was me.
[00:29:08.077 --> 00:29:08.877]  See, I care.
[00:29:09.478 --> 00:29:10.939]  I don't want to screw over some old lady.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:13.440]  Let me tell you something.
[00:29:14.881 --> 00:29:17.003]  You read these WikiLeaks, what Hillary thinks about you,
[00:29:18.126 --> 00:29:22.147]  You basement dwelling baristas, you underemployed dumbass scum.
[00:29:23.568 --> 00:29:26.288]  She's gonna rule you and suck what you got right out.
[00:29:26.928 --> 00:29:29.769]  This is a woman that steals everything, everywhere she goes.
[00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:30.469]  A kleptocrat.
[00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:32.010]  She's a kleptomaniac.
[00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:36.191]  I mean, and I harp on that because that's confirmed and admitted.
[00:29:36.911 --> 00:29:38.832]  She wants to hurt you.
[00:29:39.652 --> 00:29:41.693]  And she's going to hurt you bad.
[00:29:42.593 --> 00:29:44.013]  You think you've been hurt so far?
[00:29:44.513 --> 00:29:46.574]  The breaking of this country has just begun.
[00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:52.484]  They want to make you a permanent, dumbed-down, poor people to control.
[00:29:53.305 --> 00:29:55.887]  They want permanent peons.
[00:29:56.688 --> 00:29:57.229]  Peons.
[00:29:57.809 --> 00:29:58.650]  Serfs on the land.
[00:29:59.151 --> 00:30:00.072]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.552 --> 00:30:02.154]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.075 --> 00:30:05.778]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.083 --> 00:30:14.105]  Hey there, this is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com with a fun and exciting report by The Sun.
[00:30:14.165 --> 00:30:15.785]  He virtually rubbed my crotch.
[00:30:15.845 --> 00:30:18.486]  Woman sexually assaulted in virtual reality.
[00:30:18.566 --> 00:30:23.448]  The VR version was trying out the new technology for the first time with a game called Weaver.
[00:30:23.548 --> 00:30:28.310]  With a man using the pseudonym BigBro442 virtually groped her.
[00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:30.331]  We have decided not to name the woman.
[00:30:30.411 --> 00:30:35.454]  She wrote, In between a wave of zombies and demons to shoot down, I was hanging out next to Big Bro 442.
[00:30:35.554 --> 00:30:42.038]  Suddenly, Big Bro 442's disembodied helmet faced me dead on, and he started virtually rubbing my chest.
[00:30:42.158 --> 00:30:48.282]  The woman's first foray into virtual reality started off well as the experience won me over, lock, stock, and barrel.
[00:30:48.302 --> 00:30:53.045]  But just after three minutes in the virtual world, Big Bro 442 showed up and ruined everything.
[00:30:53.085 --> 00:30:53.726]  The woman cried,
[00:30:54.366 --> 00:30:56.970]  Stop to deter the heavy tack breather.
[00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:06.265]  Big Bro 442 came back at her again and she added, women after all are supposed to be cool and take on any form of sexual harassment with a laugh but I still told him stop.
[00:31:06.465 --> 00:31:09.450]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com
[00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:15.254]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse, minor words, and his was action.
[00:31:15.855 --> 00:31:17.376]  His was what he's done to women.
[00:31:17.416 --> 00:31:23.080]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.622]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[00:31:25.982 --> 00:31:32.167]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[00:31:32.287 --> 00:31:37.591]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[00:31:48.427 --> 00:31:51.170]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[00:31:52.031 --> 00:31:53.492]  It's a fight for our minds.
[00:31:54.153 --> 00:31:56.095]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[00:31:56.416 --> 00:32:00.620]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.104]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[00:32:04.184 --> 00:32:05.746]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:32:09.949 --> 00:32:18.956]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:32:19.056 --> 00:32:27.282]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:27.463 --> 00:32:32.166]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:32.346 --> 00:32:35.989]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:37.790]  We're good to go.
[00:33:01.164 --> 00:33:07.305]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:33:07.465 --> 00:33:26.449]  Available at Infowarslife.com If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:36.292]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:36.772 --> 00:33:49.275]  I've got stacks of news about health departments failing because of all the new diseases, the flesh-eating bacteria, the TB, the STDs, even the leprosy.
[00:33:51.315 --> 00:33:54.316]  The country has been deactivated.
[00:33:56.049 --> 00:33:58.790]  The switches of our life support are being flipped off.
[00:34:00.931 --> 00:34:06.613]  The deindustrialization, the only way to bring down the United States, is now being implemented.
[00:34:08.294 --> 00:34:14.636]  And it's being done by people who we have in triplicate, via WikiLeaks and other sources.
[00:34:15.677 --> 00:34:18.978]  It's being done by people that are engaged in this activity consciously.
[00:34:21.099 --> 00:34:24.020]  Now I want to go over Obamacare and the latest developments with that.
[00:34:25.285 --> 00:34:26.685]  But I want to explain to everybody.
[00:34:28.065 --> 00:34:29.086]  We have the WikiLeaks.
[00:34:29.366 --> 00:34:30.586]  We have Ezekiel Emanuel.
[00:34:32.146 --> 00:34:33.606]  We have the Congressional Testimony.
[00:34:35.827 --> 00:34:43.628]  They always wanted to throw out the old crop of doctors that made the United States have the best healthcare system in the world.
[00:34:44.608 --> 00:34:53.150]  So that you would adopt the socialist model, where there's a doctor on every corner, but there's no MRI machines, there's no drugs, there's no treatment.
[00:34:54.838 --> 00:34:55.639]  You hurt your knee?
[00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:56.259]  Here's a cane.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.420]  Going blind?
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.061]  Here's a cane.
[00:35:00.723 --> 00:35:01.263]  Got the flu?
[00:35:01.303 --> 00:35:01.964]  Go home and die.
[00:35:05.787 --> 00:35:08.689]  And this is what Big Pharma wants that runs healthcare.
[00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.031]  So this is their plan.
[00:35:11.651 --> 00:35:12.932]  This is their modus operandi.
[00:35:13.052 --> 00:35:14.974]  And understand something.
[00:35:15.114 --> 00:35:16.315]  That's not our opinion.
[00:35:16.355 --> 00:35:17.576]  I'm going to show you the WikiLeaks.
[00:35:17.656 --> 00:35:18.577]  You can Google it for yourself.
[00:35:18.997 --> 00:35:19.498]  WikiLeaks.
[00:35:20.278 --> 00:35:22.220]  Hillary wanted Obamacare to fail.
[00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:47.461]  But what's frustrating is, when I'm listening to local news, I don't even hear conservative talk show hosts point out that it was supposed to be free for most people and be the cost of a phone bill for others and was going to massively reduce prices and give us all these wonderful choices, when they knew the entire time that that's not what it was.
[00:35:49.562 --> 00:35:49.722]  Okay?
[00:35:49.742 --> 00:35:52.484]  So I'm going to get to all that in a presentation
[00:35:53.973 --> 00:36:04.396]  And then you're welcome once we put it out on the podcast or put it on YouTube or Facebook, you know, tonight to take the clip that we're about to break down and send it to friends and family and just say, listen, do you want to be conned the rest of your life?
[00:36:04.436 --> 00:36:05.136]  Because here's the deal.
[00:36:05.596 --> 00:36:09.737]  Hillary gets in, she's going to complete her program and that's in the emails.
[00:36:10.197 --> 00:36:15.339]  Now we told you this back at the time because we understand their blueprint, but now it's confirmed.
[00:36:15.419 --> 00:36:16.379]  And I got to be honest with you.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.600]  It's hard to believe they're this diabolical.
[00:36:21.801 --> 00:36:23.241]  I mean, even for me and
[00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:28.792]  I understand this is scary stuff to talk about, but it's what's happening.
[00:36:30.654 --> 00:36:32.996]  They know Obamacare will bankrupt the economy.
[00:36:33.036 --> 00:36:35.978]  They know it'll shut down small businesses and medium-sized.
[00:36:36.038 --> 00:36:39.141]  They know that's their admitted program.
[00:36:39.661 --> 00:36:41.302]  I keep trying to explain this, people.
[00:36:41.823 --> 00:36:43.124]  They want you broke.
[00:36:43.304 --> 00:36:44.625]  They want you destitute.
[00:36:44.685 --> 00:36:46.687]  They do not want you to be successful.
[00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:51.310]  They want total class warfare.
[00:36:52.251 --> 00:36:53.272]  Now, before I go any further,
[00:36:54.701 --> 00:36:55.782]  We're running a special.
[00:36:55.822 --> 00:37:00.066]  It's going to end, I think, Friday because we're about to sell out of it.
[00:37:00.766 --> 00:37:02.408]  But luckily more is coming in a few weeks.
[00:37:03.148 --> 00:37:04.790]  We have a mega special ending soon.
[00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:08.473]  Get Brain Force, our amazing new tropic, at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:37:27.844 --> 00:37:33.065]  L-theanine, an amino acid associated with tranquility that helps transmit nerve impulses to the brain.
[00:37:33.545 --> 00:37:36.246]  Yerba Mate leaf powder and natural energizer.
[00:37:37.286 --> 00:37:37.886]  And boy is it.
[00:37:39.281 --> 00:37:42.822]  Vitamin B12 promotes energy production and supports the adrenal glands.
[00:37:42.842 --> 00:37:45.003]  There's a bunch of other stuff in it as well.

[00:38:12.048 --> 00:38:16.709]  Also, we have the final run of Hillary for Prison shirts at cost.
[00:38:16.729 --> 00:38:16.709]  $9.95.
[00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.210]  That includes shipping.
[00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:19.991]  Own the historical shirt.
[00:38:20.631 --> 00:38:21.331]  Get the word out.
[00:38:21.671 --> 00:38:23.292]  We also have a new shirt that's very, very popular.
[00:38:23.312 --> 00:38:24.232]  It's just a red shirt.
[00:38:24.932 --> 00:38:27.433]  And it says, Trump is my president.
[00:38:27.453 --> 00:38:33.675]  And that's to wear out in public as a movement, whether they steal it or whether he wins, just to show the solidarity and show the real numbers.
[00:38:34.335 --> 00:38:36.597]  Just wear red when you vote, that's the most important thing.
[00:38:37.117 --> 00:38:39.439]  I'm told at polling places across the country there's a lot of red being worn.
[00:38:39.699 --> 00:38:40.880]  We need to get out and get some video of that.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.542]  But fight rigged elections, make your voice heard.
[00:38:43.942 --> 00:38:45.203]  The Trump is my president shirt.
[00:38:45.723 --> 00:38:47.604]  We have the Bill Clinton rape shirt as well.
[00:38:47.665 --> 00:38:49.226]  We have a limited edition that's about to sell out.
[00:38:49.486 --> 00:38:52.268]  Don't tread on me, lock her up shirt with the Gadsden flag.
[00:38:54.355 --> 00:38:59.197]  InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com, again, is the nutraceutical supplement area.
[00:38:59.257 --> 00:39:00.957]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site.

[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:16.642]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:39:17.875 --> 00:39:26.058]  But even if you can't, and you don't want to have these amazing supplements, which everybody really should have, if you just try them you'll get hooked like everybody else does, like I've been.
[00:39:26.078 --> 00:39:31.779]  Go get the free app, InfoWars.com forward slash app for Droid and iPhone.
[00:39:32.099 --> 00:39:38.441]  Send it out to everybody you know and say, hey, this is true, you know, behind the scenes reportage and cutting edge analysis.
[00:39:39.162 --> 00:39:40.922]  This is the guy they're demonizing.
[00:39:40.942 --> 00:39:43.283]  This is the organization that Hillary and everybody is attacking.
[00:39:43.643 --> 00:39:44.863]  Don't believe the mainstream media.
[00:39:45.123 --> 00:39:46.984]  Find out for yourself what we're really covering.
[00:39:48.524 --> 00:39:52.767]  Because you'll find the reason they're so scared of us is we just have a memory.
[00:39:55.108 --> 00:40:01.432]  And all we're doing is pointing out what they said they were going to do versus what they've done.
[00:40:01.472 --> 00:40:03.514]  And some people say, oh, they're always corrupt.
[00:40:03.854 --> 00:40:04.574]  You can't change that.
[00:40:04.634 --> 00:40:06.215]  No, things have gotten more corrupt.
[00:40:06.816 --> 00:40:07.696]  They're coming to a head.
[00:40:08.337 --> 00:40:10.738]  We're on the verge of a financial blow up.
[00:40:10.798 --> 00:40:12.159]  There's all these wars starting.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.221]  All major analysts agree with me on that.
[00:40:15.922 --> 00:40:16.642]  It's incontrovertible.
[00:40:17.102 --> 00:40:17.743]  We need to
[00:40:19.093 --> 00:40:22.094]  Have an awakening about this so we don't go over the edge of the abyss.
[00:40:24.295 --> 00:40:27.696]  Another mainstream refrain they put out is Alex Jones is always saying the world's about to end.
[00:40:27.736 --> 00:40:31.058]  No, I'm saying don't listen to the big mainline churches saying it's about to end.
[00:40:31.098 --> 00:40:32.358]  We can fix it with God's help.
[00:40:34.239 --> 00:40:36.420]  I'm saying we can stop major world war.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.620]  We don't have to fund jihadis.
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:38.581]  We don't have to open our borders.
[00:40:38.901 --> 00:40:40.161]  We don't have to de-industrialize.
[00:40:40.181 --> 00:40:41.342]  We don't have to attack the family.
[00:40:42.282 --> 00:40:43.783]  So again, they misrepresent what we say.
[00:40:44.912 --> 00:40:51.939]  Because they're liars, and they sit up there securely, thinking because they're part of the establishment, or wannabes, that it's okay to lie.
[00:40:51.979 --> 00:40:54.381]  But they're speaking to a smaller and smaller crowd.
[00:40:54.922 --> 00:40:56.563]  We're speaking to a larger and larger crowd.
[00:40:59.226 --> 00:41:01.168]  So, it's coming to a head.
[00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:04.851]  Gerald Cilente is coming up today.
[00:41:04.871 --> 00:41:05.651]  He hasn't been on in months.
[00:41:05.731 --> 00:41:06.671]  I'm told he's wound up.
[00:41:06.711 --> 00:41:19.597]  He has a big presentation he wants to put on, showing Michelle Obama and her lauded speech against Trump for an edited 11-year-old tape, which the Bush nephew admitted he goaded him into over an hour conversation.
[00:41:19.977 --> 00:41:21.197]  And it's tipped together into three minutes.
[00:41:22.118 --> 00:41:23.118]  Goading him and goading him.
[00:41:23.178 --> 00:41:23.978]  Tell me sex stories.
[00:41:23.998 --> 00:41:24.539]  Tell me sex stories.
[00:41:24.559 --> 00:41:25.439]  It was all set up, folks.
[00:41:26.624 --> 00:41:32.548]  Him losing his job and all that's just a foil to divert by that guy's CIA, just like the sun came up this morning.
[00:41:33.448 --> 00:41:38.071]  And Gerald wants to show these rappers and play some clips of them.
[00:41:38.111 --> 00:41:40.973]  It's very vulgar, but it's been a presidential race issue.
[00:41:41.353 --> 00:41:43.234]  These folks meet at the White House with Michelle and Obama.
[00:41:43.254 --> 00:41:44.314]  They go to parties together.
[00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:45.275]  They hang out.
[00:41:46.236 --> 00:41:47.416]  Word is they use drugs.
[00:41:48.557 --> 00:41:49.638]  That's going on big time.
[00:41:51.239 --> 00:41:53.360]  And the thing is they're hypocrites.
[00:41:54.616 --> 00:42:01.059]  I mean, you got these rappers talking about, I'm on the yacht with the champagne, give her a molly, knock her out, she didn't know what hit her.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.080]  You know, talk about raping women.
[00:42:04.381 --> 00:42:14.747]  And it's one thing, I mean, imagine if Trump had songs about flipping, you know, women pills with their champagne till they pass out so you can date rape them.
[00:42:15.247 --> 00:42:17.228]  Imagine if Trump was hanging out with folks like that.
[00:42:17.548 --> 00:42:20.410]  And my thing is, we never even raised this about Obama.
[00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:23.131]  But they want to sit there and raise it about Trump.
[00:42:23.191 --> 00:42:23.932]  Let's get that straight.
[00:42:25.794 --> 00:42:30.896]  Because every time they put out some twisted BS and we respond, they go, oh, don't attack Obama for this.
[00:42:31.296 --> 00:42:32.597]  Well, you're the ones bringing it up.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:43.642]  And then Mark Moreno's coming on with huge climate tax global government info.
[00:42:44.102 --> 00:42:46.763]  Paul Watson, always informative, hosts the fourth hour today.
[00:42:47.283 --> 00:42:51.505]  Oh, and Roger Stone's popping in at 1.30 Central, 2.30 Eastern.
[00:42:52.146 --> 00:42:54.947]  So in the middle of the third hour, that's coming up as well.
[00:42:57.193 --> 00:42:57.433]  All right.
[00:42:59.454 --> 00:43:02.014]  I want to go to these Obamacare clips right now.
[00:43:02.034 --> 00:43:08.236]  If you're a new viewer, you just tuned in, let's put back on screen the WikiLeaks from two weeks ago.
[00:43:08.256 --> 00:43:12.257]  I think it was like data dump eight or nine on Podesta's emails.
[00:43:12.797 --> 00:43:14.838]  Hillary wants Obamacare to fail.
[00:43:14.898 --> 00:43:16.078]  Don't worry, staff.
[00:43:16.538 --> 00:43:17.718]  Stop being freaked out by it.
[00:43:17.758 --> 00:43:19.279]  This is designed to wreck the economy.
[00:43:19.539 --> 00:43:21.039]  It's designed to create a train wreck.
[00:43:21.079 --> 00:43:24.140]  And then we'll take back over and come in with an even bigger screw job.
[00:43:26.215 --> 00:43:29.258]  So we'll put that back up on screen for TV viewers.
[00:43:29.998 --> 00:43:33.641]  But anybody can Google, WikiLeaks, Hillary wanted Obamacare to fail.
[00:43:34.542 --> 00:43:34.662]  Okay?
[00:43:34.682 --> 00:43:40.647]  I'm gonna scroll that up for everybody to see it.
[00:43:40.667 --> 00:43:43.409]  WikiLeaks, Hillary wants Obamacare to unravel.
[00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:47.373]  Linked email suggests Clinton rooting for Affordable Care Act to collapse.
[00:43:47.473 --> 00:43:47.813]  Why?
[00:43:48.313 --> 00:43:50.635]  To get the full plan they always wanted.
[00:43:50.856 --> 00:43:52.357]  And we told everybody this day one.
[00:43:54.673 --> 00:43:58.478]  And since I've talked about it, let's go ahead and play Ezekiel, Emmanuel, if we can, first.
[00:43:59.179 --> 00:44:09.472]  We got Charlie Rose a few weeks ago laughing at everybody with the lawyers and writers that helped, you know, write the different terms like, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, and the price of a phone bill, and all this other BS.
[00:44:11.391 --> 00:44:15.935]  And of course Obama originally came out and said he never said that two years later, but then we had the clips.
[00:44:16.335 --> 00:44:20.598]  That's how stupid they think you are, and they're hoping you're not going out and finding it.
[00:44:20.899 --> 00:44:24.281]  Well, what about when your premium goes way up and now you've got to buy it?
[00:44:25.302 --> 00:44:31.387]  Boy, only in America would insurance companies get a law written where you have to buy something from private groups so they can charge you whatever they want.
[00:44:32.088 --> 00:44:33.929]  You think they're going to get together and jack up your prices?
[00:44:34.089 --> 00:44:34.310]  Gee.
[00:44:35.578 --> 00:44:37.119]  No thinking now involved.
[00:44:37.239 --> 00:44:39.721]  You've seen them double, triple.
[00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:45.085]  This announcement of, oh, it's going to go up 25% this year, that's just some vague number.
[00:44:45.305 --> 00:44:47.967]  That's on the low end of your working class blue collar.
[00:44:48.867 --> 00:44:50.008]  It's going to go up 25%.
[00:44:52.149 --> 00:44:57.593]  If you're middle class or upper middle class, it's going to just continue until you stop putting up with it.
[00:44:58.374 --> 00:45:00.735]  Thomas Jefferson was asked, what's the level of tyranny that's possible?
[00:45:00.755 --> 00:45:04.498]  And he said, the level you will accept and put up with.
[00:45:05.922 --> 00:45:08.864]  And so people just keep wondering why it's getting so bad.
[00:45:09.284 --> 00:45:11.585]  Because we're a nation of sheep.
[00:45:12.506 --> 00:45:16.848]  A nation of soft, cowardly, feeble sports fans.
[00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:25.433]  Who know how to get upset if someone tells someone in the office their dress looks nice.
[00:45:27.434 --> 00:45:29.375]  We're a nation of basically three-year-olds now.
[00:45:29.776 --> 00:45:30.876]  And the states are mommy.
[00:45:31.877 --> 00:45:35.359]  Except mommy basically breeds us like cattle and we're what's for dinner.
[00:45:36.411 --> 00:45:40.152]  You know, in the New World Order, you didn't beef that's for dinner.
[00:45:40.692 --> 00:45:41.612]  It's dehumanization.
[00:45:43.173 --> 00:45:44.513]  So here is Ezekiel Emanuel.
[00:45:44.813 --> 00:45:50.735]  This is three years ago, laughing at everyone right after it got passed, because they all had a celebration after it passed.
[00:45:50.775 --> 00:45:54.536]  They didn't want you to know till it passed that it was a global tax.
[00:45:54.556 --> 00:45:54.876]  Here it is.
[00:45:56.938 --> 00:46:00.239]  People who knew the law as it was being written knew the president wasn't telling the truth.
[00:46:00.319 --> 00:46:03.379]  The grandfather provision written into the law itself was too narrow.
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:08.080]  And frankly, they wrote a regulation intentionally trying to get people out of the individual market.
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:12.701]  They want the people to go into the exchanges because there's a lot of people in the individual market.
[00:46:12.901 --> 00:46:17.262]  The whole point of the exchanges is to close down the individual insurance market over time.
[00:46:17.282 --> 00:46:20.343]  They wanted to move millions of people into the exchanges.
[00:46:20.463 --> 00:46:21.543]  It was intentional.
[00:46:22.023 --> 00:46:25.086]  Insurance companies don't like the individual market as it's constructed.
[00:46:25.126 --> 00:46:26.047]  They see the future.
[00:46:26.347 --> 00:46:28.009]  That individual market is going away.
[00:46:28.049 --> 00:46:29.250]  They don't want to invest in it.
[00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:31.412]  But that's not what the president said.
[00:46:31.492 --> 00:46:34.354]  This is just like self-driving cars.
[00:46:34.475 --> 00:46:35.656]  I'm not against self-driving cars.
[00:46:35.676 --> 00:46:36.396]  That's what you choose.
[00:46:37.037 --> 00:46:41.061]  Uber came out a year ago, which is also run by Rahm Emanuel's brother.
[00:46:41.261 --> 00:46:42.562]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[00:46:42.582 --> 00:46:43.323]  Talk about villains.
[00:46:44.522 --> 00:46:52.765]  And they said, by 2025, there will be no cars that are not autonomous, and we're going to have a global monopoly because we're going to work with the government to only let our company operate.
[00:46:53.125 --> 00:46:55.286]  That is our investment plan, and billions flows in.
[00:46:56.067 --> 00:46:57.327]  China says, you got a deal.
[00:46:57.347 --> 00:46:58.828]  You want a monopoly in China?
[00:46:58.888 --> 00:46:59.288]  Come on in.
[00:47:03.029 --> 00:47:05.270]  Oh, but it's okay because the Emanuels are liberals.
[00:47:06.251 --> 00:47:08.952]  This is a guy who famously, in the Clinton administration,
[00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:22.317]  Whenever they were talking about Democrats that weren't doing what they were told, they would take a knife at the table, and start stabbing it, breaking the table, breaking the knife, screaming, death, murder, blah!
[00:47:22.337 --> 00:47:23.578]  Just start, in front of everyone.
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:29.403]  And then when he, because he was only on the sidelines during the Clinton administration,
[00:47:30.239 --> 00:47:32.901]  With Obama, in the first administration is what I'm going to get to.
[00:47:33.581 --> 00:47:36.243]  He would then tell Obama to shut up in cabinet meetings.
[00:47:36.484 --> 00:47:37.104]  I'm in command.
[00:47:37.905 --> 00:47:39.125]  And Obama would do what he said.
[00:47:39.145 --> 00:47:42.648]  Let me tell you, the Emanuels are mafia.
[00:47:44.669 --> 00:47:49.273]  And you know, I was thinking, they're always trying to claim that if I talk about world government and corruption, I'm anti-Semitic.
[00:47:50.472 --> 00:47:55.373]  There's mafias of all different stripes and groups, but since you want to talk about it, the Emanuels are Jewish mafia.
[00:47:55.793 --> 00:48:00.734]  So, there you go, but I mean, it's not that Jews are bad, it's just they are the head of the Jewish mafia in the United States.
[00:48:01.455 --> 00:48:04.455]  They run Uber, they run the healthcare, they're gonna scam you, they're gonna hurt you.
[00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:15.058]  And then they got weirdos that they're allied with, like George Soros, who's a literal Nazi collaborator, and then you got Madeleine Albright, who was a Nazi collaborator, her dad was, rounding up Jews.
[00:48:15.138 --> 00:48:15.638]  I mean, it's like,
[00:48:17.031 --> 00:48:21.453]  If being against Jews that are weirdo Nazi collaborators and gangsters makes me anti-semitic, then fine.
[00:48:21.813 --> 00:48:32.918]  I'm not against Jews, but at a certain point when you people call you out, and I've been called out in hundreds of newspapers the last month as being anti-semitic because I talk about a global corporate combine.
[00:48:33.259 --> 00:48:35.520]  Well, why are you labeling the TPP Jewish?
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:40.022]  I mean, it's got Jews involved in it, just like it's got everybody else.
[00:48:40.102 --> 00:48:43.423]  It's communist Chinese, global government, Japan.
[00:48:43.463 --> 00:48:44.304]  I mean, all these groups.
[00:48:45.913 --> 00:48:47.154]  But again, I'm gonna skip this break.
[00:48:48.054 --> 00:48:51.457]  It's injected into it that you must be anti-semitic.
[00:48:51.477 --> 00:48:56.560]  So I was just sitting back, I go, well let me, let me then, I guess I better do some exposés on the Jewish Mafia.
[00:48:59.842 --> 00:49:04.365]  And you know, a guy foaming at the mouth with knives at cabinet meetings, basically threatening the president.
[00:49:06.866 --> 00:49:07.567]  Totally crazed.
[00:49:11.949 --> 00:49:14.251]  Who's got his fingers in everything, screwing us over.
[00:49:16.749 --> 00:49:18.812]  I mean, how do you come up with this stuff?
[00:49:19.593 --> 00:49:20.555]  Where does this come from?
[00:49:21.556 --> 00:49:21.877]  Why?
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:24.681]  It's disgusting!
[00:49:27.116 --> 00:49:31.458]  So you just heard Ezekiel Emanuel saying, of course these insurance companies know the way we're going.
[00:49:31.698 --> 00:49:39.622]  Just like they're announcing there won't be anybody driving cars anymore, because the insurance companies, which are owned by the big banks, are going to raise your premium until you've got to go driverless.
[00:49:39.783 --> 00:49:43.624]  And then all the new cars coming out already have driverless car software in them, boys and girls.
[00:49:44.165 --> 00:49:50.008]  So you pay for the stuff you don't even want, and you pay for your own enslavement, and they're going to tax you by the mile, and it's all been announced.
[00:49:50.268 --> 00:49:52.269]  Everything I told you 20 years ago is now public.
[00:49:53.598 --> 00:49:54.739]  They say, how did you know 20 years ago?
[00:49:55.419 --> 00:50:00.081]  Because it was in the big tech publications, it was in the MIT quarterly, it was in all the documents.
[00:50:00.462 --> 00:50:02.182]  And I have NSA whistleblower sources.
[00:50:03.763 --> 00:50:04.904]  That I don't even need anymore.
[00:50:04.964 --> 00:50:05.804]  It's all passe.
[00:50:05.884 --> 00:50:06.745]  It's all out in the open.
[00:50:08.956 --> 00:50:29.227]  And we've got horrible communist Chinese government mafia, with horrible Islamic mafia, with horrible German socialist mafia, and horrible French mafia, and the Islamic mafia, and the Jewish mafia, and just all these Russian mafias, and Italian mafias, and all this CIA WASP mafias, and
[00:50:30.478 --> 00:50:33.200]  It's just organized crime that doesn't want a free market.
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:43.108]  And then they come in with this Obamacare and double and triple and screw people over and cut 35 million people to part-time and then sit there and say, shut up, you're anti-Semitic.
[00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:47.391]  We're going under a world government.
[00:50:47.411 --> 00:50:48.832]  We're going under a TPP.
[00:50:48.872 --> 00:50:51.054]  We're going under unelected systems.
[00:50:51.754 --> 00:50:53.936]  And no amount of BS changes that.
[00:50:54.817 --> 00:50:57.499]  No amount of BS changes the fact they're getting ready to steal the election for Hillary Clinton.
[00:50:59.121 --> 00:51:10.288]  You've got Andrea Mitchell married to Alan Greenspan, who ran the country, and who says the Federal Reserve is above the law and outside of government, but is a governmental institution, which it's not.
[00:51:11.609 --> 00:51:20.594]  With Hillary last week, with her Chief of Staff, with her Press Secretary, handing her the phone, she nods and then reads the question about, oh, he's bullying women.
[00:51:20.994 --> 00:51:22.055]  I mean, it's so rigged.
[00:51:22.075 --> 00:51:27.038]  You've got the Federal Reserve and the media and Hillary just all there like we're idiots right in front of us.
[00:51:29.991 --> 00:51:55.838]  And then they've got such a flaming hard-on to destroy America and destroy what's left of Christianity and the Renaissance, that literally led the way in human liberty, that they've branded the West as what's evil and the West as what's bad, and they're bringing in the most horrible, backwards, 80% men, military-age men, into the United States and Europe to do God knows what, all because it's incompatible and they want to just
[00:51:58.644 --> 00:52:01.765]  Mutilate and trash everything.
[00:52:04.506 --> 00:52:05.246]  Let's go to the next one.
[00:52:07.907 --> 00:52:08.647]  Here's Obama.
[00:52:09.227 --> 00:52:13.689]  Promises lower health insurance premiums by $2,500 per year.
[00:52:14.049 --> 00:52:14.489]  Remember that?
[00:52:14.969 --> 00:52:19.130]  Well, now you're going to get 25% increases every year if you're lucky on the low end.
[00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:20.511]  So remember this.
[00:52:20.811 --> 00:52:22.711]  They hate the fact that we go back in the time machine.
[00:52:23.111 --> 00:52:24.632]  Here's Obama a few years ago.
[00:52:27.369 --> 00:52:31.491]  ...is to lower your premiums by up to $2,500 per family per year.
[00:52:32.291 --> 00:52:37.393]  We will start by reducing premiums by as much as $2,500 per family.
[00:52:37.453 --> 00:52:45.676]  Here's what change is saying to people who already have health insurance and the employers who are providing it, we'll work to lower your premiums.
[00:52:45.696 --> 00:52:46.096]  That's enough.
[00:52:46.236 --> 00:52:49.137]  There's no need to have him say it 18 more times.
[00:52:49.197 --> 00:52:53.599]  Here's the headline, Obamacare premiums to go up by double digits in the lowest bracket.
[00:52:55.336 --> 00:52:57.237]  That's McClatchy Associated Press.
[00:52:58.218 --> 00:52:59.919]  They'll just respond and say conspiracy theory.
[00:52:59.939 --> 00:53:04.282]  Okay, let's go ahead and go, because you know, that's all you got to do to be intellectual, just say conspiracy theory.
[00:53:05.002 --> 00:53:09.886]  CBS anchors confused, just a few years later, about why Obamacare premiums are skyrocketing.
[00:53:09.906 --> 00:53:10.246]  Here it is.
[00:53:12.751 --> 00:53:18.675]  Millions of Americans will face big price hikes and fewer choices when Obamacare open enrollment begins.
[00:53:18.955 --> 00:53:24.798]  The government says the cost of mid-level health plans next year will increase by an average of 25 percent.
[00:53:25.219 --> 00:53:28.000]  That will hit consumers in 39 states.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.482]  Major carriers are dropping out in some markets.
[00:53:30.902 --> 00:53:35.465]  About one in five consumers will be able to choose from only one provider.
[00:53:35.825 --> 00:53:40.708]  Government numbers show about two and a half million Americans not currently enrolled could
[00:53:42.576 --> 00:53:44.377]  That's enough.
[00:53:45.297 --> 00:53:47.078]  That's their whitewash numbers.
[00:53:47.098 --> 00:53:50.860]  But you know, since we mentioned Rose, I don't mean to throw you guys off, but I've got like five more clips.
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:57.683]  Can we go back to Rose two weeks ago with the White House writers on, celebrating, laughing and giggling?
[00:53:57.723 --> 00:54:00.384]  I mean, it's not as powerful audio-wise.
[00:54:00.784 --> 00:54:03.045]  It's more powerful if you're a TV viewer and can actually see it.
[00:54:03.366 --> 00:54:04.986]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:54:05.466 --> 00:54:06.767]  But it is redonkulous.
[00:54:07.747 --> 00:54:10.949]  This is just like Gruber laughing and saying, thank God you're dumb and all the rest of it.
[00:54:12.802 --> 00:54:13.986]  Uh, here is, uh, Charlie Rose.
[00:54:21.264 --> 00:54:28.989]  I really like... I was very... The joke speech is the most fun part of this, but the things I'm the most proud of were the more serious speeches, I think.
[00:54:29.369 --> 00:54:37.233]  Healthcare, economic speeches, and I think... Lovett wrote the line about, if you like your insurance, you can keep it.
[00:54:37.313 --> 00:54:37.694]  How dare you?
[00:54:37.714 --> 00:54:41.196]  And you know what?
[00:54:41.256 --> 00:54:41.936]  It's so true.
[00:54:42.036 --> 00:54:46.799]  And it's all these know-it-alls who've inherited the United States, who've taken over power...
[00:54:48.888 --> 00:54:50.729]  And then they just enjoy screwing everyone.
[00:54:51.509 --> 00:55:00.433]  And by the way, I didn't go far enough with Emanuel, Rahm Emanuel and his brother being basically Jewish Mafia in my research for you.
[00:55:01.354 --> 00:55:05.936]  Rahm Emanuel's dad, and again, everybody knows I'm not an Israel basher, I'm just saying this guy's the worst of the worst.
[00:55:08.357 --> 00:55:13.639]  His dad led the Israeli force that would do false flags.
[00:55:13.679 --> 00:55:16.801]  This is in the Jerusalem Post.
[00:55:18.055 --> 00:55:24.781]  He led the group that basically founded Israel, but the way they did it was staging terror attacks to blame the Arabs.
[00:55:26.643 --> 00:55:28.725]  Like bombing the King David Hotel and stuff like that.
[00:55:30.426 --> 00:55:41.597]  So, I just thought I'd add that in there for you, just so you understand who Rahm Emanuel is, since they, since, I mean, if I'm going to get accused of being anti-Semitic, I might as well just, you know, actually expose that I am anti-mafia.
[00:55:44.264 --> 00:55:48.125]  I don't like the Chinese mafia, the Italian mafia, the Jewish mafia, the Irish mafia.
[00:55:48.145 --> 00:55:52.426]  The mafia never flew too well down here in Texas because people wouldn't put up with it.
[00:55:54.407 --> 00:55:58.168]  And I guess I'm just a throwback here, but I'm not putting up with it.
[00:55:59.608 --> 00:56:06.170]  And it's disgusting to watch these different mafias all involved in a gang rape of this republic.
[00:56:07.389 --> 00:56:11.190]  Now, President Obama claims premium rates increases are not due to Obamacare.
[00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:12.490]  This is just a few days ago.
[00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:14.471]  It's not Obamacare.
[00:56:14.511 --> 00:56:15.851]  No, enough of you didn't get registered.
[00:56:16.171 --> 00:56:17.632]  You didn't do what you were supposed to.
[00:56:18.332 --> 00:56:19.152]  It's your fault.
[00:56:19.172 --> 00:56:20.733]  Don't worry, Hillary's coming in, though.
[00:56:20.973 --> 00:56:22.773]  You'll finally get the freebie with her.
[00:56:22.833 --> 00:56:23.233]  Here it is.
[00:56:24.554 --> 00:56:30.875]  And then, in some cases, insurers just set their prices too low at the outset because they didn't know what the insurance pool was going to look like.
[00:56:31.676 --> 00:56:33.036]  And then they started losing money.
[00:56:34.505 --> 00:56:37.867]  And so now they've decided to significantly increase premiums in some states.
[00:56:40.469 --> 00:56:47.573]  It's these premium increases in some of the states, in the marketplace, that sometimes attracts negative headlines.
[00:56:50.154 --> 00:57:01.221]  Remember, these premium increases won't impact most of the people who are buying insurance through the marketplace because even when premiums go up, the tax credits go up to offset the increases.
[00:57:03.581 --> 00:57:09.965]  People who qualify for tax credits, they may not even notice their premiums went up because... That's enough.
[00:57:10.845 --> 00:57:13.687]  You know, the numbers they just gave you on CBS News are the cooked ones.
[00:57:13.727 --> 00:57:14.728]  It's much worse than what they're saying.
[00:57:14.748 --> 00:57:17.009]  This is more bamboozling, more con games.
[00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:22.773]  In the first year of Obamacare, global insurance company profits went up over 40%, just on the U.S.'
[00:57:22.733 --> 00:57:23.113]  's back.
[00:57:24.974 --> 00:57:31.278]  And CPAs in the last decade, they passed laws that would say they are held accountable if you get audited.
[00:57:32.799 --> 00:57:35.280]  So you go into CPAs, you say, I want all these deductions.
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:36.500]  They say, get another CPA.
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.961]  And you can't find CPAs that will give them to you.
[00:57:39.701 --> 00:57:41.042]  You've got to go to get a tax lawyer.
[00:57:42.682 --> 00:57:46.983]  So the average person doesn't even know how they're getting screwed over.
[00:57:47.003 --> 00:57:48.304]  They just know they're getting less money.
[00:57:49.204 --> 00:57:51.565]  Or they know that they were now forced to go get health care.
[00:57:52.352 --> 00:57:53.592]  So see, there's the argument.
[00:57:53.612 --> 00:58:07.035]  Well, you can't have folks coming in and getting their health care for free, so we gotta force everybody to buy it because we're going bankrupt, but then they bring in 30 million illegals and tell them everything's free to accelerate the bankruptcy and let folks come into the country with TB, tuberculosis, everything else you can imagine.
[00:58:09.976 --> 00:58:14.757]  Then we have ABC tells Obamacare users get ready for some sticker shock.
[00:58:15.097 --> 00:58:16.277]  Let's play that clip, ABC.
[00:58:17.605 --> 00:58:21.268]  Well get ready for some sticker shock if you're looking into the price of Obamacare plans.
[00:58:21.308 --> 00:58:25.971]  The average premiums are expected to rise by 25% next year.
[00:58:26.451 --> 00:58:30.874]  Many consumers will also be limited to choosing plans from just one provider.
[00:58:30.895 --> 00:58:33.817]  Alright, now the final clip I'll play when we come back.
[00:58:34.577 --> 00:58:38.520]  Is MSNBC, Democrats are going to have to answer for Obamacare rates.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:40.862]  Now, why would MSNBC suddenly tell the truth?
[00:58:40.882 --> 00:58:44.465]  Because they said I was deeply racist and didn't want a black man to succeed.
[00:58:44.485 --> 00:58:46.887]  I mean, we've got that clip because I was against Obamacare.
[00:58:47.327 --> 00:58:49.169]  We're going to explain what they're really up to here.
[00:58:49.529 --> 00:58:52.751]  See, now they're getting ready to totally bankrupt it and bring in the new scam.
[00:58:53.152 --> 00:58:54.833]  So now they can tell you what a horrible deal it was.
[00:58:59.787 --> 00:59:01.569]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:59:01.669 --> 00:59:02.309]  Michael Moore.
[00:59:02.389 --> 00:59:05.452]  Trump's election will be the biggest FU in history.
[00:59:05.552 --> 00:59:07.634]  An article up by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:59:07.694 --> 00:59:15.700]  During a speech for his new one-man stage performance, Trumpland, Michael Moore remarked that the election of Donald Trump will be the biggest FU in history.
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:21.345]  Moore began by saying he knew a lot of people in Michigan who are going to vote for Trump, who are not racist to rednecks.
[00:59:21.505 --> 00:59:21.805]  I don't know.
[00:59:40.933 --> 00:59:56.301]  That's why every beaten down, worthless, forgotten, working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle class loves Trump, arguing that Trump was the human Molotov cocktail that they've been waiting for, the human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole the lives from them.
[00:59:56.401 --> 00:59:59.162]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:02.244 --> 01:00:04.845]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:22.091 --> 01:00:27.233]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:27.734 --> 01:00:30.015]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:41.011]  So it's your fault that you didn't sign up if you're 20 years old for your free Obamacare, which isn't free, it'll cost you on average about $5,000 a year.
[01:00:44.494 --> 01:00:47.658]  But then it's also the old people's fault because they're using the system too much.
[01:00:47.698 --> 01:00:51.983]  See, once they get you in a collectivist system, they can hold everybody hostage.
[01:00:53.370 --> 01:01:05.953]  But all the left needs to know is, you're right about big megacorporations being very, very criminal on average, doing a lot of horrible things, but you're always saying big government will stop them when they're the ones pushing for big government.
[01:01:05.973 --> 01:01:06.813]  100 times out of 100.
[01:01:06.933 --> 01:01:13.394]  Hillary has gotten 20 to 1 donations from billionaires that Trump got.
[01:01:13.414 --> 01:01:14.655]  That's Bloomberg.
[01:01:15.515 --> 01:01:16.975]  The number's probably even less than that.
[01:01:18.555 --> 01:01:21.296]  He's gotten the most small donations of any candidate ever.
[01:01:23.362 --> 01:01:24.583]  And he's broken all records.
[01:01:26.084 --> 01:01:30.886]  But see, you really don't want to be anti-establishment that made this country great and gave us innovation.
[01:01:30.967 --> 01:01:32.688]  You don't care.
[01:01:33.568 --> 01:01:37.050]  You want to feel like you're part of the winning team and kind of waddle around, and I get it.
[01:01:38.271 --> 01:01:41.953]  But understand, in the WikiLeaks, they talk about how stupid you are.
[01:01:41.973 --> 01:01:43.734]  Hell, they do it on C-SPAN.
[01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:45.675]  They do it on PBS.
[01:01:48.237 --> 01:01:50.218]  And it is so frustrating.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:02:00.408]  To sit there and watch all these pseudo-intellectuals really pretend in their own minds that they're part of the establishment going along with it, when they're being screwed as well.
[01:02:01.769 --> 01:02:03.250]  So let's go ahead and go to MSNBC.
[01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:05.012]  Democrats are going to have to answer.
[01:02:05.332 --> 01:02:07.254]  Now, they can only do this now.
[01:02:09.667 --> 01:02:10.548]  Because they got it through.
[01:02:10.568 --> 01:02:12.110]  Remember they said there are no death panels.
[01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:12.530]  It's free.
[01:02:12.611 --> 01:02:13.552]  You can keep your doctor.
[01:02:13.592 --> 01:02:15.174]  Then it's the price of a phone bill.
[01:02:15.194 --> 01:02:17.036]  Then the price of a cable bill.
[01:02:17.056 --> 01:02:19.078]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:02:19.118 --> 01:02:20.200]  There's no penalties.
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:22.082]  Thousands of news articles.
[01:02:22.162 --> 01:02:24.144]  Matt Drudge is a liar.
[01:02:24.785 --> 01:02:26.367]  There is no penalty.
[01:02:26.427 --> 01:02:27.749]  This started three years ago.
[01:02:29.864 --> 01:02:32.345]  And now it's up to $5,000 a person.
[01:02:32.685 --> 01:02:33.785]  There is no penalty.
[01:02:33.865 --> 01:02:35.465]  It's a lie of racists.
[01:02:36.205 --> 01:02:36.826]  It's a lie.
[01:02:36.866 --> 01:02:38.246]  There are no increases.
[01:02:39.146 --> 01:02:47.288]  Coming up next on All Things Considered, we're going to talk in soft voices because we are the intellectuals and we use big words and we have large thesauruses.
[01:02:49.448 --> 01:02:56.970]  You're a bunch of heartless mercenary trash who sit around and talk about how I have a dark heart,
[01:02:58.746 --> 01:02:59.766]  And how I'm reckless?
[01:03:01.086 --> 01:03:04.607]  Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice, but I'm not reckless with the truth.
[01:03:06.108 --> 01:03:10.108]  I'm reckless in my resistance, because I know that's one of the things in history that's never changed anything.
[01:03:11.729 --> 01:03:13.869]  But you people are disgraceful, and everybody knows it!
[01:03:14.029 --> 01:03:16.130]  I'm telling you, Hillary is going to lose it on the inside, folks.
[01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:18.310]  The evidence is coming up in the next segment.
[01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:19.590]  It's overwhelming.
[01:03:22.331 --> 01:03:24.711]  Kane, Drudge Report, has a story with the photos.
[01:03:26.332 --> 01:03:26.732]  Her VP,
[01:03:28.308 --> 01:03:35.271]  Went to Florida, where they're supposedly so far ahead in all the polls, because they oversample massive numbers more of Democrats.
[01:03:36.512 --> 01:03:37.793]  I know I keep harping on that.
[01:03:38.633 --> 01:03:39.333]  They admit it.
[01:03:39.393 --> 01:03:40.474]  I can't believe the public's this dumb.
[01:03:40.934 --> 01:03:42.955]  Kane plays 230 in Florida.
[01:03:43.676 --> 01:03:50.439]  And you click on the story, and there's literally hardly anyone even in front of the stage.
[01:03:52.179 --> 01:03:53.500]  And they said it was 30 people.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.480]  And it was mainly their campaign operatives.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.841]  I mean, this is a joke.
[01:03:57.381 --> 01:03:58.282]  There's video of it.
[01:03:59.722 --> 01:04:01.643]  Let's just doppelganger the story up to Infowars.com.
[01:04:01.663 --> 01:04:02.383]  This is so important.
[01:04:02.403 --> 01:04:03.103]  Just copy the whole thing.
[01:04:03.884 --> 01:04:04.524]  Get out to everybody.
[01:04:05.544 --> 01:04:11.107]  Let's go out to break, though, with this MSNBC Democrats are going to have to answer for Obamacare.
[01:04:11.127 --> 01:04:11.367]  Here it is.
[01:04:12.145 --> 01:04:20.992]  It's a real problem both for the Clinton campaign and potentially for Democrats heading in to what's going to be the first year of a new administration, a new Congress.
[01:04:21.813 --> 01:04:30.880]  This is exactly what Republicans were warning about when they opposed this law and both sides have been so dug in on trying to make changes to this law.
[01:04:30.961 --> 01:04:40.669]  Democrats have refused basically to reopen it because they think that Republicans would take an opportunity to make changes to the law to essentially gut it and completely get rid of it.
[01:04:41.269 --> 01:04:45.052]  They've been at this standstill for years now, really.
[01:04:45.072 --> 01:04:45.432]  Oh, that's enough.
[01:04:45.472 --> 01:04:47.854]  And the people that are paying the price... She goes on.
[01:04:48.194 --> 01:04:53.338]  Now suddenly they're so truthful and so good, and suddenly her teleprompter's loaded with stuff.
[01:04:54.139 --> 01:04:56.341]  Because the Republicans helped write this bill.
[01:04:56.541 --> 01:04:57.942]  This is part two of screwing you.
[01:04:58.182 --> 01:05:03.707]  They're all together with their knives, sharpened, and now, oh, they're gonna fix it, though.
[01:05:04.027 --> 01:05:04.928]  Oh, yeah.
[01:05:10.225 --> 01:05:18.349]  Although this book is written in short chapters, chapter 46 is 11 pages long because it is an alphabetical list of the scandals of the Clintons.
[01:05:18.409 --> 01:05:21.050]  Not explained, just an alphabetical list of them.
[01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:22.110]  You need to know that.
[01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:28.293]  In chapter 47, the media magic, how to make a story... And you dedicate your book to victims of rape.
[01:05:28.693 --> 01:05:35.316]  Survivors, survivors, and there's a difference because there are a lot of people who are still victims of rape and sex abuse.
[01:05:35.456 --> 01:05:41.139]  And I intend, after this election, to continue to talk about this because it's a scourge on our country.
[01:05:41.599 --> 01:05:51.864]  Some people have survived, some people are thriving, some people have gotten healing, and some people, like Billy and Hillary, have not gotten healing and they are projecting their problems onto the American public.
[01:05:51.984 --> 01:05:57.067]  And she is incompetent, she hates people, so how can you hate people and get anything accomplished?
[01:05:57.387 --> 01:06:03.370]  You need to work with people, as I did with Lawyers for Affordable Housing, to get 350 volunteer lawyers.
[01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:07.412]  You think it's hard to run a company with 350 employees?
[01:06:07.672 --> 01:06:10.373]  Try 350 volunteers, okay?
[01:06:10.713 --> 01:06:14.595]  So you have to be able to work with people, and she cannot do this.
[01:06:14.995 --> 01:06:20.057]  She is racist, and everything she says about racism is projection.
[01:06:20.077 --> 01:06:21.778]  I never heard her personally do this.
[01:06:21.838 --> 01:06:25.780]  What I heard was Billy talk about the warden doing this, and the warden was his
[01:06:26.985 --> 01:06:28.999]  Shall we say pet name for his wife?
[01:06:30.228 --> 01:06:30.748]  The warden.
[01:06:31.149 --> 01:06:41.954]  And when I maybe would go to see him at the governor's mansion, one of the troopers would call and say the warden's not gone yet because they kind of picked up on it and they liked that too.
[01:06:42.294 --> 01:06:53.460]  So everything that you read by former Secret Service, former Arkansas State Police, people talking about Hillary and the way she is, believe it, people, it is true.
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:56.521]  And the thing of it is, her actions are so egregious.
[01:06:56.841 --> 01:06:57.642]  How could you believe it?
[01:06:58.482 --> 01:07:00.903]  The big problem is that the problem is so big.
[01:07:01.243 --> 01:07:02.744]  Who can wrap their minds around it?
[01:07:03.084 --> 01:07:06.826]  Except someone who grew up in Hot Springs or maybe Chicago or New Orleans.
[01:07:07.266 --> 01:07:11.688]  But this is not normal for America and it's not the way the United States should be.
[01:07:12.668 --> 01:07:16.710]  The Clintons are trying to turn the United States into a third world country.
[01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:19.731]  And speaking of third world countries, look at Haiti.
[01:07:20.071 --> 01:07:25.253]  They stole millions and millions of dollars that was sent to the Clinton Foundation for the Haitians.
[01:07:25.854 --> 01:07:25.253]  90, 90, 96%.
[01:07:27.234 --> 01:07:30.256]  The Haitians are picketing the Clinton headquarters in Newark.
[01:07:30.876 --> 01:07:32.076]  Is anyone covering that?
[01:07:32.316 --> 01:07:33.097]  But at a gut level...
[01:07:34.332 --> 01:07:38.297]  Honestly, as I said in the book, sometimes I feel sorry for Hillary.
[01:07:38.598 --> 01:07:38.898]  I do.
[01:07:39.239 --> 01:07:42.884]  She has spent her whole life running for this office.
[01:07:43.064 --> 01:07:45.768]  This is the entire focus of her addiction.
[01:07:46.108 --> 01:07:50.314]  However, I do not admire it any more than I admire
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:59.606]  A drug addict who gets up in the middle of the night and comes to break in my house to steal jewelry or anything else to sell to fix his habit.
[01:07:59.666 --> 01:08:05.991]  She has sold the United States to fix her habit, her addiction for power and money.
[01:08:06.011 --> 01:08:09.494]  She has made this clear in her writings and in her speeches all along.
[01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:14.420]  We are on the march.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.263]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:08:17.964 --> 01:08:21.648]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:52.367]  Remove Donald Trump from the equation and just look at
[01:08:54.264 --> 01:09:12.533]  Dozens of foreign governments, including the Communist Chinese, talk about abuse of women, forced abortions, killing newborn babies, treating women as third-class citizens, killing Buddhist monks, killing people that are caught practicing Buddhist exercises, selling their organs, but not a word from the liberal trendies.
[01:09:13.213 --> 01:09:21.237]  I mean, to the liberals' credit, back in the 80s and 90s, there was criticism of Tiananmen Square and the one-child policy, but not now.
[01:09:22.077 --> 01:09:24.359]  His authoritarianism is so in vogue.
[01:09:26.241 --> 01:09:29.263]  And you've got all these foreign leaders and the corrupt Pope.
[01:09:30.204 --> 01:09:37.530]  And you've got the Saudi Arabian Mafia and just all these groups telling us we can't have Donald Trump.
[01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:41.794]  And we've got the IMF and World Bank and the UN coming in with the EU security force.
[01:09:42.034 --> 01:09:46.418]  That's in Reuters again today to oversee our election because it's evident the Russians are going to steal it.
[01:09:49.155 --> 01:09:51.817]  There's no election fraud, and it doesn't exist, and Trump's insane.
[01:09:52.697 --> 01:10:00.923]  But the OECD security unit from the EU is here because they're worried about Trump supporters trying to intimidate voters.
[01:10:01.243 --> 01:10:14.451]  I've got Reuters, AP, you name it, here today saying today, 13 days out, that Trump's planning to steal the election, but he's insane when he first raised the issue of election integrity.
[01:10:15.332 --> 01:10:18.534]  Again, we've reached this otherworldly place.
[01:10:20.009 --> 01:10:22.271]  Where we're now into Data Dump 17 from WikiLeaks.
[01:10:22.331 --> 01:10:34.979]  Joe Biggs was just showing me more emails on top of the last four or five data dumps where POTUS, President of the United States, is using a pen name, a nom de plume, as French, coup d'etat, which is French for coup d'etat.
[01:10:35.059 --> 01:10:36.821]  It's a joke from the movie Hop, pretty funny kids movie.
[01:10:38.593 --> 01:10:50.044]  And you've got all these establishment people just running around foaming at the mouth and begging to show me new emails where they actually say, Oh my God, they know that POTUS is communicating with her via the server.
[01:10:50.084 --> 01:10:51.305]  We've got to cover this up.
[01:10:51.325 --> 01:10:54.668]  It actually says, we've got to cover this up and clean this up.
[01:10:55.209 --> 01:10:55.909]  That is 100%.
[01:10:59.810 --> 01:11:16.657]  Pure felonies, up one side and down the other, knowingly committing crimes, using a Nome Diplom to circumvent the Freedom of Information Act, and to get around Congress, and to get around the people, and to get around all of this, and then they're caught.
[01:11:18.558 --> 01:11:19.298]  The smoking gun.
[01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:21.519]  Cheryl Mills tells Podesta we need to clean this up.
[01:11:21.619 --> 01:11:23.460]  Obama has emails from her.
[01:11:26.394 --> 01:11:26.955]  That's today.
[01:11:26.995 --> 01:11:28.336]  That just broke Zero Hedge.
[01:11:28.876 --> 01:11:29.877]  I didn't even know it was up yet.
[01:11:29.997 --> 01:11:31.018]  It just came out this morning.
[01:11:31.338 --> 01:11:32.539]  Biggs has got the emails as well.
[01:11:32.559 --> 01:11:40.446]  He's going to come in here and cover it briefly at the bottom of the hour with Gerald Cilente, who's about to join us from his studios in Kingston, New York.
[01:11:41.607 --> 01:11:44.390]  But for me, it's just so crazy.
[01:11:44.770 --> 01:11:45.851]  There's new emails out.
[01:11:46.652 --> 01:11:48.573]  This is an article just went up on InfoWars.com.
[01:11:48.994 --> 01:11:52.437]  Clinton campaign admits making false claims against Trump.
[01:11:55.427 --> 01:11:57.869]  And then they're in the emails admitting it's basically all fake.
[01:11:57.909 --> 01:12:00.292]  Just like they admit in the Podesta email that came out yesterday.
[01:12:00.312 --> 01:12:02.114]  We've got to get ahead of this.
[01:12:02.774 --> 01:12:05.757]  We've got to get with all the major pollsters and tell them to over-sample.
[01:12:05.877 --> 01:12:07.939]  So it looks like Hillary's the winner early on.
[01:12:07.959 --> 01:12:12.524]  They over-sampled the ABC poll yesterday.
[01:12:12.544 --> 01:12:14.946]  In Florida, she wins by 12 points.
[01:12:15.667 --> 01:12:16.487]  They over-sampled 12 points.
[01:12:19.107 --> 01:12:21.190]  They oversample 45, 50 points in some.
[01:12:21.230 --> 01:12:28.021]  This is so... I don't know what to call this because, I mean, I know he's been a best-selling author, was a lobbyist before that, worked in and out of government.
[01:12:28.322 --> 01:12:29.103]  Really smart guy.
[01:12:29.123 --> 01:12:30.926]  Gerald Cilente, TrendsResearch.com.
[01:12:32.728 --> 01:12:36.429]  He wants to get into their hypocrisy today, which is something I should have done.
[01:12:36.449 --> 01:12:39.451]  I'm glad he wanted to do this, because we never prescript what he's going to cover.
[01:12:39.471 --> 01:12:40.571]  I always know he has something amazing.
[01:12:40.951 --> 01:12:42.572]  It's kind of like great restaurants you go to.
[01:12:42.712 --> 01:12:43.412]  There's not even a menu.
[01:12:43.432 --> 01:12:44.393]  They just say, hey, you're going to like it.
[01:12:44.993 --> 01:12:49.134]  And he's got this whole deal of clips we're going to play where these rappers are saying, I'm drugging women.
[01:12:49.194 --> 01:12:49.815]  I'm raping them.
[01:12:49.855 --> 01:12:50.515]  You know, it's great.
[01:12:50.775 --> 01:12:53.536]  And then meanwhile, they're hanging out with Michelle and Obama.
[01:12:54.156 --> 01:12:54.857]  And then meanwhile,
[01:12:55.837 --> 01:12:58.478]  She comes out and gives this big speech that Glenn Beck and everybody else lauded.
[01:12:58.498 --> 01:12:59.698]  Oh, it was the best speech ever.
[01:12:59.718 --> 01:13:02.159]  Talking about, oh, the misogynistic behavior of Donald Trump.
[01:13:02.439 --> 01:13:03.439]  We won't put up with that.
[01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:11.062]  When you're the ones literally pushing the hip-hop gangster culture that is about the worst culture in the world after Saudi Arabia for women.
[01:13:12.162 --> 01:13:13.043]  Or communist China.
[01:13:13.063 --> 01:13:13.663]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:13:14.163 --> 01:13:20.605]  They just are... Donald Trump isn't even the same universe towards abusing women as communist China or the rest of it.
[01:13:22.751 --> 01:13:25.754]  So, we've got so much to go over with Gerald Cilente.
[01:13:25.774 --> 01:13:28.276]  We've got Madonna pledges oral sex for Clinton voters.
[01:13:28.376 --> 01:13:28.816]  Remember that?
[01:13:28.996 --> 01:13:29.417]  Last week?
[01:13:32.339 --> 01:13:35.802]  I mean, imagine if Trump's people were talking like this.
[01:13:37.323 --> 01:13:37.904]  It's crazy!
[01:13:38.785 --> 01:13:39.966]  So, we're 13 days out.
[01:13:39.986 --> 01:13:41.407]  We've got reports here in Texas.
[01:13:41.827 --> 01:13:43.048]  This is Infowars.com.
[01:13:43.569 --> 01:13:45.210]  It's on WOAI out of San Antonio.
[01:13:45.230 --> 01:13:46.391]  The machines are all turning off.
[01:13:46.411 --> 01:13:47.572]  Everybody's votes are flipping.
[01:13:47.652 --> 01:13:48.112]  It's bad.
[01:13:48.353 --> 01:13:49.834]  They might just take Texas and give it to Hillary.
[01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:53.031]  They've already been psyoping, but suddenly about to go blue.
[01:13:53.871 --> 01:13:56.932]  Report, votes switch from Trump to Hillary in Texas.
[01:13:57.692 --> 01:14:01.873]  Director of Elections then runs, this is a powerful video, runs from her own David Knight.
[01:14:03.273 --> 01:14:06.654]  When they try to just talk to him about the Capitol, he actually runs.
[01:14:07.355 --> 01:14:09.715]  Michael Moore says Trump's election will be the biggest F.U.
[01:14:09.735 --> 01:14:10.155]  in history.
[01:14:11.676 --> 01:14:15.257]  Alleged Clinton fixer, New York Times, has become the National Enquirer.
[01:14:17.014 --> 01:14:21.156]  Obama's death spiral, double-digit cost spikes, disappearing choices.
[01:14:21.556 --> 01:14:25.577]  It was a monopoly takeover by big banks that own the insurance companies.
[01:14:25.897 --> 01:14:27.018]  Same thing with driverless cars.
[01:14:27.038 --> 01:14:31.080]  They're going to raise your taxes, raise the regulations to where you've got to be in a driverless car.
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:32.600]  This is how they control society.
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:39.663]  And then Rahm Emanuel's brother runs Uber and says, I'm going to get you out of your car within 10 years and you're going to pay me.
[01:14:40.902 --> 01:14:43.684]  He talks like this thug so he gets all the investment.
[01:14:44.244 --> 01:14:45.565]  But he's shown he delivers.
[01:14:45.925 --> 01:14:52.290]  Obamacare, Uber, taking over transportation, taking over healthcare, taking over everything.
[01:14:52.690 --> 01:14:54.451]  Not with innovation, but screw jobs.
[01:14:58.734 --> 01:14:59.575]  But I go back to this.
[01:15:00.115 --> 01:15:03.037]  Wow, Tim Kaine holds rally and only 30 people show up.
[01:15:03.077 --> 01:15:05.479]  That's up on DrugsReport.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:15:05.539 --> 01:15:06.179]  Powerful video.
[01:15:06.259 --> 01:15:07.160]  I don't even know if it's 30 people.
[01:15:08.035 --> 01:15:10.636]  But we're meant to believe there's going to be this landslide.
[01:15:10.896 --> 01:15:13.158]  Gerald Solente joins us.
[01:15:13.218 --> 01:15:16.159]  TransitResearch.com really doesn't need any introduction.
[01:15:16.479 --> 01:15:17.220]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:18.420]  Where do you want to start first?
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:23.002]  I mean, obviously, we can get into a situation with the hypocrisy.
[01:15:23.022 --> 01:15:25.424]  You've got a long laundry list of it here that should be attacked.
[01:15:25.444 --> 01:15:28.685]  But what do you make of just this otherworldliness?
[01:15:28.765 --> 01:15:31.827]  Because the mainstream media is on fumes.
[01:15:31.847 --> 01:15:32.867]  They have almost no viewers.
[01:15:33.848 --> 01:15:35.889]  But still, they are just doubling down, Gerald.
[01:15:37.090 --> 01:15:47.933]  Well, I think the big issue is, for example, if you go to Politico or any of the other sites, it's the attacks against Donald Trump for his, quote, locker room talk.
[01:15:48.614 --> 01:15:52.435]  And that's why you're getting a lot of women that are going to be voting for Hillary Clinton.
[01:15:53.154 --> 01:16:06.829]  And I want to say today, at this point, at this moment, that this could be a game-changing event if it's promoted by you and others and put in the context that it deserves.
[01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:12.154]  Michelle Obama is a disgusting fraud.
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:18.064]  Just like her husband, birds of a feather flock together.
[01:16:18.945 --> 01:16:20.946]  She's going around the country.
[01:16:21.447 --> 01:16:23.068]  How heartbroken she is.
[01:16:23.568 --> 01:16:29.193]  How disgusting it is of what Donald Trump has said.
[01:16:30.213 --> 01:16:39.501]  Compared to what Donald Trump has said, and the people that the Obamas promote, this is kiddie talk.
[01:16:40.831 --> 01:16:51.636]  The Obamas are promoting the most disgusting, low-life individuals that are destroying the culture of society.
[01:16:52.256 --> 01:17:02.041]  And as Michelle Obama preaches around the country how our little children are hearing these disgusting things about Trump.
[01:17:03.141 --> 01:17:16.928]  She's ignoring the fact that both Barack Obama and Michelle Obama are promoting the most disgusting human beings on the planet that are really infecting the children.
[01:17:17.469 --> 01:17:23.252]  Little kids, Alex, aren't tuned in to the presidential reality show.
[01:17:24.032 --> 01:17:25.353]  They're listening to rap.
[01:17:26.454 --> 01:17:32.897]  And the rap that the Obamas are promoting are the ones that they bring into the White House.
[01:17:33.618 --> 01:17:43.143]  We the people, our White House, they invite this lowlife scum that degenerates women
[01:17:43.783 --> 01:17:50.906]  At a disgusting and obscene level with language and details that don't even come close.
[01:17:50.926 --> 01:17:51.566]  And let's be clear.
[01:17:51.586 --> 01:17:53.327]  We're going to go through the lyrics of this.
[01:17:53.347 --> 01:17:55.308]  I know it's a family audience, but you're right.
[01:17:55.548 --> 01:17:57.049]  This has always been the hottest thing with kids.
[01:17:57.069 --> 01:18:00.730]  Even back when I was in school, I liked the more gutter type rap stuff.
[01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:01.951]  Too short, you name it.
[01:18:02.351 --> 01:18:03.791]  It's not even liking it.
[01:18:04.072 --> 01:18:05.352]  This is what they have.
[01:18:05.872 --> 01:18:08.013]  It's not a family audience.
[01:18:08.313 --> 01:18:10.314]  This is what they're playing on radio.
[01:18:10.674 --> 01:18:11.515]  I agree.
[01:18:12.375 --> 01:18:15.963]  So let me just add this point, General, because what you're saying is so key.
[01:18:16.003 --> 01:18:19.190]  This is secretly recorded Donald Trump stuff that they're forcing on everybody.
[01:18:19.410 --> 01:18:21.996]  Meanwhile, they're at the White House with the scum that target kids.
[01:18:22.036 --> 01:18:22.296]  Go ahead.
[01:18:23.127 --> 01:18:41.792]  Yeah, and not only that, she's preaching about how, you know, our little girls and our little children are hearing this, and that loving fathers are sickened by daughters being exposed to this vicious language about women, and they're bringing these people into the White House?
[01:18:42.452 --> 01:18:47.334]  Barack and Michelle, are you playing this stuff in front of your kids?
[01:18:48.274 --> 01:18:58.697]  Oh, and by the way, we the people are footing the bill for this as they bring this low-life scum into the White House to sing about it.
[01:18:59.137 --> 01:19:00.697]  Put on some of those clips.
[01:19:01.097 --> 01:19:04.378]  Put on the clips of Rick Ross.
[01:19:04.858 --> 01:19:07.159]  Put on the clips of Big Sean.
[01:19:07.519 --> 01:19:14.300]  These are the people that they invited into the White House, and they're talking about what Trump is saying?
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:16.281]  This doesn't even come close.
[01:19:17.622 --> 01:19:21.264]  We're going to show the lyrics on screen for TV viewers, and I'll read some of them, but I can't really on FCC.
[01:19:21.304 --> 01:19:23.086]  We're on over 200 stations now.
[01:19:23.106 --> 01:19:24.266]  It's well over 200 now, folks.
[01:19:24.867 --> 01:19:28.649]  So we can't obviously play this, but they have the bleep versions that they have for our kids.
[01:19:29.289 --> 01:19:30.450]  But this is what's being pushed.
[01:19:30.490 --> 01:19:31.511]  This is what's being put out.
[01:19:31.531 --> 01:19:33.512]  This is what they invite to the White House.
[01:19:34.213 --> 01:19:37.455]  And again, Hollywood trying to sexualize our children, all of it.
[01:19:37.955 --> 01:19:44.959]  Then they flip around and act like they're in the Victorian age, sitting there demonizing Donald Trump.
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.180]  It's the height of hypocrisy.
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.181]  And Gerald Solente is right.
[01:19:47.641 --> 01:19:55.666]  We should take these clips and put out special reports that can be internet only so we can actually show the vulgarity to show people the type of brainwashing that's going on.
[01:19:55.746 --> 01:20:00.429]  We'll break a lot of this down on the other side with Gerald Solente of Trends Research.
[01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:01.290]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:20:01.810 --> 01:20:04.132]  TrendsResearch.com, InfoWars.com.
[01:20:04.152 --> 01:20:04.552]  Stay with us.
[01:20:09.605 --> 01:20:13.991]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:20:14.091 --> 01:20:25.025]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[01:20:25.185 --> 01:20:30.108]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:20:30.228 --> 01:20:32.730]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[01:20:32.810 --> 01:20:34.271]  It helps detoxify.
[01:20:34.291 --> 01:20:37.352]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:20:37.392 --> 01:20:42.135]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:20:42.175 --> 01:20:46.298]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[01:20:46.738 --> 01:20:48.379]  ...dependent upon selenium.
[01:20:48.399 --> 01:20:53.744]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:20:53.844 --> 01:20:55.285]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[01:20:55.465 --> 01:20:56.206]  This is so key.
[01:20:56.466 --> 01:21:00.769]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:02.891]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[01:21:03.031 --> 01:21:06.494]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.

[01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:16.485]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:23.431]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:21:23.651 --> 01:21:26.895]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[01:21:26.915 --> 01:21:28.116]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[01:21:28.416 --> 01:21:30.258]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[01:21:30.558 --> 01:21:34.801]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[01:21:35.041 --> 01:21:35.862]  This is sustainable.
[01:21:35.962 --> 01:21:39.965]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[01:21:40.165 --> 01:21:43.347]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:21:43.387 --> 01:21:46.450]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:47.951]  We're looking at the television screen.
[01:21:47.991 --> 01:21:53.715]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:21:53.735 --> 01:21:59.479]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call

[01:23:01.521 --> 01:23:02.682]  That means it's clean.
[01:23:02.983 --> 01:23:03.944]  That means it's pure.
[01:23:04.144 --> 01:23:06.927]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[01:23:11.052 --> 01:23:12.353]  You can't survive without it.
[01:23:12.554 --> 01:23:13.455]  But where do you get it?
[01:23:13.755 --> 01:23:19.524]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:23:19.744 --> 01:23:25.472]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:23:25.652 --> 01:23:42.519]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[01:24:12.352 --> 01:24:13.492]  We're back with Gerald Cilenta.
[01:24:13.532 --> 01:24:14.473]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:24:14.513 --> 01:24:16.173]  Let's play that clip of Michelle Obama.
[01:24:16.193 --> 01:24:17.294]  This is her lauded speech.
[01:24:17.334 --> 01:24:29.038]  She's giving across the country the outrage of a secretly recorded, highly edited tape that the Bush creature admits he goaded Trump into basically saying.
[01:24:29.858 --> 01:24:32.098]  So, this is all part of their clandestine operations.
[01:24:32.478 --> 01:24:39.300]  Force-fed to the media, and then they blame Trump for this being in the news when it's a secretly recorded rap recording.
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:44.661]  Meanwhile, they have people in the White House that literally talk about drugging women and raping them.
[01:24:45.341 --> 01:24:49.682]  And they have these people around their kids, and then the daughters are out twerking and everything at the concerts.
[01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:50.762]  But that's okay!
[01:24:50.782 --> 01:24:51.322]  Well, fine!
[01:24:51.882 --> 01:24:56.623]  But then don't sit there and judge Trump, who never claimed he was, you know, some perfect angel.
[01:24:57.263 --> 01:24:57.903]  Here is that clip.
[01:24:58.757 --> 01:25:01.378]  This was not just a lewd conversation.
[01:25:01.418 --> 01:25:04.038]  This wasn't just locker room banter.
[01:25:05.159 --> 01:25:12.320]  This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior.
[01:25:13.381 --> 01:25:22.623]  And actually bragging about kissing and groping women using language so obscene that many of us were worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV.
[01:25:25.788 --> 01:25:31.092]  Again, they've called this sexual assault, saying women would throw themselves at him and he could do whatever he wanted to.
[01:25:31.712 --> 01:25:32.613]  Sounds a little bit like a pig.
[01:25:32.913 --> 01:25:35.995]  I'm not like that, but hey, Trump never claimed to be an angel.
[01:25:36.636 --> 01:25:37.977]  Now, here's a clip of Madonna.
[01:25:38.017 --> 01:25:38.697]  We can play this.
[01:25:38.717 --> 01:25:43.381]  The other ones have too much cussing and we're going to read some of the transcripts here with Gerald Cilente, but he's absolutely right.
[01:25:43.781 --> 01:25:45.782]  We've got to put these videos together and point this out.
[01:25:45.802 --> 01:25:47.624]  I had this idea weeks ago and just never got around to it.
[01:25:47.924 --> 01:25:49.325]  All the rap stars and the rest of it.
[01:25:49.825 --> 01:25:51.046]  Mark Dice has pointed this out.
[01:25:51.086 --> 01:25:52.087]  It's very key.
[01:25:52.727 --> 01:25:53.548]  So here's Madonna.
[01:25:55.066 --> 01:26:01.452]  One more thing before I introduce this genius of comedy.
[01:26:02.833 --> 01:26:06.637]  If you vote for Hillary Clinton, I will give you a blowjob.
[01:26:06.937 --> 01:26:07.238]  Okay?
[01:26:09.219 --> 01:26:12.082]  So she says, if you vote for Hillary, I will give you oral sex.
[01:26:12.603 --> 01:26:14.324]  I mean, this is just the trashiness of these people.
[01:26:14.344 --> 01:26:15.365]  And then this trash.
[01:26:16.406 --> 01:26:18.989]  At least she's not talking about raping women like the rappers did.
[01:26:20.305 --> 01:26:23.867]  This trash then points their finger at Trump in some edited secret recording.
[01:26:24.067 --> 01:26:26.508]  I guess that's what's got you so hot, because I know you're not a big Trump supporter.
[01:26:26.828 --> 01:26:28.509]  You're just pointing out the hypocrisy, Gerald.
[01:26:29.370 --> 01:26:32.651]  Yes, and the hypocrisy of Michelle Obama.
[01:26:33.112 --> 01:26:38.294]  As I said, both her and her husband are disgusting frauds.
[01:26:38.574 --> 01:26:42.737]  You know Michelle's line, and you know Barack's line.
[01:26:43.137 --> 01:26:47.159]  When they go low, we go high.
[01:26:48.464 --> 01:26:50.205]  How low can they go?
[01:26:50.225 --> 01:26:56.027]  Hey, maybe the high they're talking about is all these rappers coming in there.
[01:26:56.327 --> 01:26:58.168]  Yeah, they may really get high.
[01:26:58.729 --> 01:27:08.233]  You cannot get lower than the people that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama have invited into We the People's White House.
[01:27:09.113 --> 01:27:25.888]  These low-life, disgusting people talking about getting women drugged out, getting them drunk and having sex with them, bragging how many women they could get at one time, and if you bring your friends over here, I'll do them to them too.
[01:27:26.748 --> 01:27:32.574]  One dirty piece of language after another, coming from the mouths!
[01:27:33.254 --> 01:27:42.280]  Of the people that Barack Obama, and better than now Michelle Obama, invite to the White House.
[01:27:43.881 --> 01:27:53.267]  And bragging, bragging, doing the dancing with them, and of course Michelle shooting her mouth off all over the country.
[01:27:53.728 --> 01:27:54.949]  Our loving father.
[01:27:54.989 --> 01:28:01.213]  Well then there's the thing about Hillary that basically harasses women and makes them have sex with her, that's well known, that's not coming out.
[01:28:01.650 --> 01:28:09.195]  Well again, just staying on this one point about them going after Trump for stuff that's minor league.
[01:28:10.076 --> 01:28:14.479]  And again, I'm not defending him, but compared to the filth
[01:28:15.407 --> 01:28:18.007]  The poisoned minds of children!
[01:28:18.027 --> 01:28:27.709]  There's no doubt, there's no doubt, Nickelodeon, MTV is all targeting the pre-teens with horrible sexualized, just ghetto, prison garbage.
[01:28:28.509 --> 01:28:32.370]  And continuing here, then let's start getting into some of the people they've invited over, Gerald.
[01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:35.731]  I mean, let's talk about who's coming to the White House, what they're saying specifically.
[01:28:36.031 --> 01:28:39.431]  I mean, I've got Big Sean, Mona Lisa lyrics.
[01:28:40.672 --> 01:28:41.832]  I mean, I can't even read this on air.
[01:28:42.472 --> 01:28:43.933]  Well, read some of them.
[01:28:44.314 --> 01:28:46.776]  You could blank out the dirty parts.
[01:28:47.377 --> 01:28:51.041]  It just talks about drugging women and raping them.
[01:28:51.721 --> 01:29:02.832]  But again, this is Michelle Obama with that arrogant attitude, just like a husband, going around the country talking about Donald Trump.
[01:29:03.763 --> 01:29:15.455]  And criticizing him as they are promoting and inviting these vile people into the People's White House, entertaining them.
[01:29:15.756 --> 01:29:18.739]  Oh, and by the way, us picking up the tab.
[01:29:18.899 --> 01:29:25.806]  That's right, taxpayers paying for people that put out lyrics about drug dealing, exploitation of women.
[01:29:25.826 --> 01:29:31.591]  I ain't gonna lie, I got a million dollar chick with a billion dollar bleeper.
[01:29:32.112 --> 01:29:36.196]  Every time I come, I swear to God, I feel like I be rich.
[01:29:37.357 --> 01:29:39.259]  And it just goes on and on and on about drugging women.
[01:29:39.279 --> 01:29:40.320]  Well go on, read some more of it.
[01:29:41.519 --> 01:29:43.400]  Yeah, trying to get that hotel money.
[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:46.722]  But you know them crackers ain't gonna let you get the Ritz.
[01:29:47.062 --> 01:29:50.904]  They ain't gonna let you get the fountain in the front with the fist.
[01:29:51.344 --> 01:29:52.665]  They're gonna give you courtside.
[01:29:52.685 --> 01:29:53.465]  It just goes on.
[01:29:53.485 --> 01:29:55.446]  It's all about raping women and all the rest of it.
[01:29:55.526 --> 01:29:55.687]  Yep.
[01:29:56.167 --> 01:29:57.868]  Getting them drunk and raping them.
[01:29:58.308 --> 01:29:58.628]  Hold on.
[01:29:58.648 --> 01:29:59.829]  Well, that's, you know, that's liberal though.
[01:29:59.849 --> 01:30:00.409]  That's okay.
[01:30:00.589 --> 01:30:01.029]  Don't be racist.
[01:30:01.049 --> 01:30:02.770]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.853 --> 01:30:16.958]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.

[01:31:09.992 --> 01:31:11.794]  Joe Bates here with InfoWars.com.
[01:31:11.874 --> 01:31:12.515]  Michael Moore.
[01:31:12.595 --> 01:31:15.658]  Trump's election will be the biggest FU in history.
[01:31:15.759 --> 01:31:17.841]  An article up by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:31:17.901 --> 01:31:25.910]  During a speech for his new one-man stage performance, Trumpland, Michael Moore remarked that the election of Donald Trump will be the biggest FU in history.
[01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:31.516]  Moore began by saying he knew a lot of people in Michigan who were going to vote for Trump, who were not racist or rednecks.
[01:31:31.796 --> 01:31:32.517]  We're good to go.
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:53.040]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[01:32:13.775 --> 01:32:19.440]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:24.123]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[01:32:25.004 --> 01:32:27.206]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[01:32:27.306 --> 01:32:28.467]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[01:32:29.147 --> 01:32:31.709]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[01:32:32.670 --> 01:32:33.030]  Or more.
[01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:35.072]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[01:32:35.552 --> 01:32:37.013]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[01:32:38.234 --> 01:32:40.036]  But I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[01:32:40.076 --> 01:32:40.896]  It's actually scary.
[01:32:43.218 --> 01:32:53.303]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[01:32:54.304 --> 01:33:07.110]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support Infowars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[01:33:19.989 --> 01:33:21.677]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.118 --> 01:33:24.970]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:30.726 --> 01:33:32.207]  All right, a couple of key items here.
[01:33:32.427 --> 01:33:36.971]  We're about to add more updates to the free app at Infowars.com forward slash app.
[01:33:37.011 --> 01:33:38.172]  We launched it about a month ago.
[01:33:39.093 --> 01:33:43.536]  Last time I checked, it has like 400,000 downloads.
[01:33:44.017 --> 01:33:44.997]  It's about 50-50.
[01:33:45.538 --> 01:33:46.599]  Apple versus Droid.
[01:33:46.619 --> 01:33:55.025]  That sounds great, but I mean, we've got four or five million people terrestrially tuning in every day, and this has got video feeds, audio feeds.
[01:33:55.366 --> 01:33:57.567]  We're about to add news updates, alerts.
[01:33:58.448 --> 01:34:09.013]  Special video feeds special reports all the reporters will be able to go through this platform Live give you an alert go live and then archive it there And then we can HD
[01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:13.231]  Upload it to other platforms.
[01:34:13.311 --> 01:34:14.672]  I mean, this is a weapon system.
[01:34:15.172 --> 01:34:21.236]  And I intend down the road to have trusted people that are auxiliary reporters and stuff, get their own profile on this.
[01:34:21.296 --> 01:34:25.338]  I'll just let you know that now, so that you can get to a big audience whenever you need to.
[01:34:25.838 --> 01:34:27.459]  We gotta vet those folks to do that, obviously.
[01:34:28.039 --> 01:34:30.861]  So go get the free app, InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:34:31.561 --> 01:34:33.262]  Tell people about it, because, okay, 400,000 people.
[01:34:33.282 --> 01:34:34.103]  We need 10 million people.
[01:34:38.667 --> 01:34:40.008]  I mean, again, I'm so frustrated.
[01:34:40.028 --> 01:34:42.228]  There's this Trump speech that I think is the most powerful he's given.
[01:34:43.649 --> 01:34:44.569]  I named the video.
[01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:47.050]  This video could win the election for Trump.
[01:34:47.070 --> 01:34:51.152]  And it's only gotten like 500,000 views on the two platforms.
[01:34:52.092 --> 01:34:52.552]  It's so weird.
[01:34:52.612 --> 01:34:54.913]  If I really want something to be big, it doesn't happen.
[01:34:55.933 --> 01:35:03.319]  But then I know I just churn out research and info, and then it's just the random stuff is like 30 million views, 20 million views, 10 million views.
[01:35:03.399 --> 01:35:07.703]  Every week we're getting videos with 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 million views!
[01:35:08.804 --> 01:35:09.444]  30 million!
[01:35:11.065 --> 01:35:19.332]  The press conference in our feeds now has 30 million views of the Danny Williams press conference last week before the debate.
[01:35:20.573 --> 01:35:22.875]  And a little bit of info gets out, but it's just like, really?
[01:35:22.895 --> 01:35:24.697]  30 million people watch this?
[01:35:26.877 --> 01:35:30.941]  And it's like the Daily Beast trying to interrupt and attack him and say he just wants money.
[01:35:31.842 --> 01:35:36.486]  And a little bit of info got out, but it's like, whoa, CNN doesn't have 30 million viewers in a week, people.
[01:35:37.967 --> 01:35:41.771]  So I'm not complaining, I just, we've got lightning in a bottle, I just can't control it.
[01:35:43.212 --> 01:35:50.499]  And that's what's really frustrating, is that we could really hurt them if the right videos, like Salente just said, I could see his energy, never seen him as hyped up.
[01:35:52.054 --> 01:35:52.855]  Great minds think alike.
[01:35:53.295 --> 01:36:01.880]  Two weeks ago, I saw a Mark Dice video similar to that was saying, showing these horrible rappers, the things they're doing, and then the fact that, compared to what Trump did, it's nothing.
[01:36:02.501 --> 01:36:11.266]  And then she blames that this is public, on Trump when they secretly recorded it and edited it, and it's 11 years old, while they're at the White House.
[01:36:12.086 --> 01:36:14.728]  I mean, I fight to keep my children away from gangster rap.
[01:36:14.848 --> 01:36:15.549]  It's addictive.
[01:36:16.469 --> 01:36:20.372]  I hear it, I start getting brainwashed by it, but it's what, why do you think the CIA
[01:36:21.826 --> 01:36:32.233]  In the 90's had this weaponized, this is admitted, top rappers have gone public, but I've talked to the top execs from, you name it, I've talked to top rock stars that were in the meetings, they said, listen, you go with gangster type stuff or we're not putting you on air.
[01:36:33.053 --> 01:36:34.994]  We're selling 20 million records a year, what do you mean?
[01:36:35.094 --> 01:36:36.175]  Shut up, it's gonna happen.
[01:36:37.016 --> 01:36:38.096]  Music is culture.
[01:36:38.637 --> 01:36:41.739]  Going back a thousand years ago, the king could be overthrown by one jester.
[01:36:42.459 --> 01:36:46.762]  One, you know, one guy playing his little banjo with ballads about the king.
[01:36:47.964 --> 01:36:49.405]  And, you know, how King John's corrupt.
[01:36:49.445 --> 01:36:51.867]  I mean, that isn't just in Disney movies.
[01:36:51.887 --> 01:36:52.488]  That really happens.
[01:36:52.508 --> 01:36:53.829]  So they know how to control that.
[01:36:54.469 --> 01:36:56.531]  And look what they've done to the black community with this stuff.
[01:36:58.852 --> 01:36:59.833]  And it's happening everywhere else.
[01:36:59.893 --> 01:37:00.934]  It is a poison.
[01:37:00.954 --> 01:37:04.497]  We're going to go back to Gerald Cilente of TrendsResearch.com here in a moment.
[01:37:05.370 --> 01:37:07.191]  Before I go any further, we are Lister Supported.
[01:37:07.291 --> 01:37:15.918]  We have the Hillary for Prison shirt that has revolutionized the campaign, been absolutely a bellwether, pointed out she's a criminal, but all things come to an end.
[01:37:16.238 --> 01:37:18.460]  It's still a bestseller, but when it runs out, it runs out.
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:19.260]  We're not making any more.
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:23.763]  It'll probably be less than 13 days till it sells out, because we're not making any more of Hillary for Prison.
[01:37:23.964 --> 01:37:25.985]  It's got Infowars.com on the back, legalized freedom.
[01:37:26.646 --> 01:37:28.647]  There's another shirt that's limited edition, made in America.
[01:37:28.967 --> 01:37:32.470]  That's the Gadsden, lock her up, the Gadsden snake taking on Hillary.
[01:37:33.948 --> 01:37:36.729]  That is limited edition, about to sell out, five-star review on that.
[01:37:36.749 --> 01:37:39.870]  We have the new Trump is my President all red shirt.
[01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:41.591]  You order it now, you'll get it way before election.
[01:37:41.851 --> 01:37:51.735]  Wear it out there, let people know at the polling places so they understand that they're not going to be able to cover up the fact there's a landslide for Trump and all the metrics show.
[01:37:52.938 --> 01:38:00.921]  Google Analytics Show, Top Professors Show, but we've got the WikiLeaks where they're doing the fake polls to try to make it look like, with over-sampling, she's the winner.
[01:38:01.201 --> 01:38:02.121]  So that's going on as well.
[01:38:02.221 --> 01:38:03.822]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:38:04.262 --> 01:38:05.502]  And this ends in just a few days.
[01:38:05.522 --> 01:38:08.804]  25% off our top-selling nootropic brain force.
[01:38:09.184 --> 01:38:11.244]  Find out why it's so amazing and fund the broadcast.
[01:38:11.565 --> 01:38:12.725]  We need the support as well.
[01:38:13.005 --> 01:38:13.605]  It's a win-win.
[01:38:13.725 --> 01:38:17.407]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:38:18.267 --> 01:38:20.588]  And then finally, we have a film that I'm in.
[01:38:21.744 --> 01:38:24.466]  That is now available on DVD and for screenings.
[01:38:24.826 --> 01:38:27.988]  You can sign up with them to show it at a local theater in your area or find out where it's showing.
[01:38:28.689 --> 01:38:37.535]  And that is a new film directed by Chuck Underseas with General Jerry Boykin, former head of Special Forces, Charlie Daniels, Gilbert Griffin, Joel Skousen, and myself, Alex Jones.
[01:38:37.575 --> 01:38:42.958]  It covers a range of topics such as Privacy 2021, the Federal Reserve, Nationalism versus Globalism, and much more.
[01:38:43.318 --> 01:38:48.442]  Visit Revelation, that's one word, revelationthemovie.info to purchase the DVD or check
[01:38:49.022 --> 01:38:50.604]  Into hosting it at the theater near you.
[01:38:50.924 --> 01:38:53.307]  That's Revelation, the movie, .info.

[01:39:00.316 --> 01:39:03.560]  Okay, going back to Gerald Cilente of Trends Research.
[01:39:06.809 --> 01:39:09.911]  I want to get more into the... I think we've lost his audio.
[01:39:09.931 --> 01:39:10.571]  Can we turn him up?
[01:39:10.851 --> 01:39:11.712]  Hello?
[01:39:11.732 --> 01:39:12.092]  Yep, yep.
[01:39:12.112 --> 01:39:12.412]  You're back.
[01:39:12.432 --> 01:39:12.853]  Sorry, Gerald.
[01:39:12.873 --> 01:39:13.153]  Go ahead.
[01:39:13.693 --> 01:39:13.913]  Okay.
[01:39:14.113 --> 01:39:16.615]  You know, I'm in that movie as well, you know.
[01:39:16.695 --> 01:39:17.375]  Revelations.
[01:39:17.776 --> 01:39:17.956]  You are.
[01:39:17.996 --> 01:39:18.196]  Yes, sir.
[01:39:18.216 --> 01:39:18.976]  I should have mentioned that.
[01:39:18.996 --> 01:39:20.137]  That's alright.
[01:39:20.477 --> 01:39:24.320]  Now... You know, you said I'm very upset, and I am.
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:33.445]  Because, again, Michelle Obama, like her husband, they're disgraceful, disgusting frauds.
[01:39:33.565 --> 01:39:34.586]  She's a hypocritical pig.
[01:39:35.612 --> 01:39:38.355]  I want to read to you some of her comments.
[01:39:39.657 --> 01:39:44.923]  She said, I'm campaigning against hurtful, hateful language about women.
[01:39:46.345 --> 01:39:46.745]  She said,
[01:39:48.058 --> 01:39:58.344]  Language, as parents, we have to protect our children and protecting them against our children of sexually predatory behavior.
[01:39:58.945 --> 01:40:03.007]  Language so obscene that many worry about our children.
[01:40:03.307 --> 01:40:16.976]  Now remember, she's talking about this in context to what Donald Trump said while they invite these rappers that speak openly about sexually predators?
[01:40:17.956 --> 01:40:20.257]  More, way more disgusting than that.
[01:40:20.497 --> 01:40:22.937]  Let's name the predators and let's go over some of the lyrics.
[01:40:23.578 --> 01:40:24.818]  Here, here, Rick Ross.
[01:40:25.398 --> 01:40:27.579]  Invited to the White House, we the people.
[01:40:27.979 --> 01:40:29.659]  Picking up the tab for this guy.
[01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:32.820]  Put Molly in all her champagne.
[01:40:33.821 --> 01:40:35.181]  She ain't even know it.
[01:40:35.961 --> 01:40:39.082]  I took her home and I enjoyed that.
[01:40:39.882 --> 01:40:41.883]  She ain't even know it.
[01:40:42.623 --> 01:40:53.351]  So, Michelle, you mean he fed her a load of champagne, got her drunk, had sex with her when she passed out, and you're talking about Trump?
[01:40:53.831 --> 01:41:00.336]  You are as disgusting... Michelle Obama meets with, with a date rape promoter.
[01:41:01.107 --> 01:41:01.587]  You got it.
[01:41:02.147 --> 01:41:17.754]  Big Sean, another person they invite to the White House, that we the people pick up the tab for, as she's shooting a mouth-off around the country with this better-than-thou attitude, how low Trump is.
[01:41:18.354 --> 01:41:21.555]  Hey, when they go low, we go high.
[01:41:21.876 --> 01:41:22.916]  Yeah, they go high.
[01:41:23.236 --> 01:41:27.258]  They bring in the people that get the highest hit of anything.
[01:41:27.918 --> 01:41:32.261]  These people, Big Sean, you read some of his lyrics, here are some more.
[01:41:33.481 --> 01:41:35.343]  I believe in God and rubbers.
[01:41:36.403 --> 01:41:40.826]  Hey, Michelle, did you have your kids out there when he was singing that?
[01:41:41.346 --> 01:41:43.348]  No, maybe for this next lyric.
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:52.869]  Even we sex you and not my lover, hit you on the couch and not the covers.
[01:41:53.530 --> 01:41:56.373]  Hey, you mean you do them anywhere, huh?
[01:41:56.714 --> 01:41:59.377]  Oh, and you're talking about Trump's dirty language?
[01:41:59.817 --> 01:42:01.359]  You hypocrite!
[01:42:01.799 --> 01:42:04.783]  And all you little prostitutes out there!
[01:42:05.143 --> 01:42:07.104]  Your little Anderson Coopers!
[01:42:07.724 --> 01:42:23.769]  All of you little nobodies out there with big mouths that won't repeat these words or call out the Obamas for lying, freaking frauds they are to invite this scum into we the people's house.
[01:42:24.369 --> 01:42:25.370]  Let me continue.
[01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:26.190]  And make us pay for it.
[01:42:27.515 --> 01:42:33.557]  And, yeah, and if you bring your friend, then we got to F her.
[01:42:34.018 --> 01:42:37.259]  Hey, you bring your friend, we got to F her.
[01:42:37.299 --> 01:42:41.180]  Oh, are you gonna, wait, you're gonna use the couch in the White House when you F her?
[01:42:41.801 --> 01:42:43.441]  Hey, let's go on.
[01:42:45.402 --> 01:42:48.964]  My life is my odyssey, my dog's to the right of me.
[01:42:49.664 --> 01:42:52.125]  Oh, hey, that's what you call him?
[01:42:53.143 --> 01:42:55.425]  And he keeps going on and on.
[01:42:56.285 --> 01:42:58.427]  My mama say I'm a poet.
[01:42:58.587 --> 01:43:00.868]  Oh, hey, mama said, then you must be.
[01:43:01.769 --> 01:43:04.011]  You hating, praying, I blow it.
[01:43:05.171 --> 01:43:09.774]  But this life I made through, I show a bad bitch.
[01:43:10.831 --> 01:43:12.311]  What she made for.
[01:43:12.331 --> 01:43:13.852]  Hey!
[01:43:14.432 --> 01:43:17.933]  You don't want your children to hear what Trump said?
[01:43:18.433 --> 01:43:19.713]  Of course not, Ms.
[01:43:19.833 --> 01:43:20.393]  Obama!
[01:43:20.753 --> 01:43:27.595]  That's why you invite these low-life rappers into We The People's house.
[01:43:27.695 --> 01:43:29.536]  And then have the nerve to go around and moralize.
[01:43:29.556 --> 01:43:30.516]  Let me add this point.
[01:43:31.196 --> 01:43:37.260]  Look, I didn't agree with Tipper Gore trying to take over labeling and getting involved in the free press, because at least on a dangerous road, it's up to parents.
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:50.269]  But, if Tipper Gore came out and was criticizing Trump, she would have some standing, even though her husband's been accused of raping the rest of it, because at least she had spoken out against this stuff before, separately.
[01:43:50.649 --> 01:43:56.553]  But with the Obamas, they're bringing it all in, Hollywood's pushing it, mainstream media's pushing it, to then turn around and act like
[01:43:57.443 --> 01:44:05.569]  Trump and some secret recording saying much milder stuff is the devil again just shows that it's pure fraud, pure garbage being foisted on us.
[01:44:06.630 --> 01:44:10.251]  Hey, when they go low, we go high.
[01:44:10.812 --> 01:44:11.812]  That's their line.
[01:44:12.132 --> 01:44:14.453]  You can't go lower than the Obamas.
[01:44:14.733 --> 01:44:28.559]  Look, this little nothing of a community organizer that organized nothing, lied his way into office as an anti-war candidate, and now we're in wars longer than any other president's been in office.
[01:44:28.659 --> 01:44:29.719]  And Obamacare is screwing us.
[01:44:29.739 --> 01:44:30.880]  Don't forget Obamacare.
[01:44:31.866 --> 01:44:32.687]  Oh, Obamacare.
[01:44:32.707 --> 01:44:33.848]  Oh, it's beautiful.
[01:44:34.208 --> 01:44:35.670]  Again, a fraud.
[01:44:36.430 --> 01:44:41.715]  Hey, folks, first day in office, I'm going to close Guantanamo within a year.
[01:44:42.436 --> 01:44:44.378]  One lie after another.
[01:44:44.738 --> 01:44:53.486]  She's on the campaign trail out there, lying about what Trump is saying and failing.
[01:44:54.007 --> 01:44:55.548]  None of the media is picking up.
[01:44:56.309 --> 01:45:06.637]  Whereby they are bringing in the people that are corrupting the children's minds the most, while everyone's ignoring that.
[01:45:06.718 --> 01:45:11.882]  And again, just to make this clear, little kids aren't listening to the campaign.
[01:45:11.902 --> 01:45:13.323]  No, absolutely.
[01:45:13.343 --> 01:45:16.305]  They're listening to weaponized media and gangster hip-hop.
[01:45:16.345 --> 01:45:19.087]  That's what the average 10-year-old is force-fed in this culture.
[01:45:19.848 --> 01:45:21.990]  And that's what the Obamas are promoting.
[01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:26.372]  The Obamas are promoting this more than anybody else.
[01:45:26.653 --> 01:45:29.654]  Hey, the fish rots from the head down.
[01:45:30.095 --> 01:45:31.896]  And they can't stop promoting this.
[01:45:32.176 --> 01:45:34.197]  Like you said, where's Obama now?
[01:45:34.577 --> 01:45:41.301]  His 43rd time out in California with the so-called entertainment industry.
[01:45:41.721 --> 01:45:44.423]  Raising money for more of this.
[01:45:45.811 --> 01:45:47.272]  Joe Salente, you made your point.
[01:45:47.292 --> 01:45:51.454]  I think we're going to take this interview and some of these clips of these rappers and actually put it out.
[01:45:51.594 --> 01:45:55.175]  And you know, with the headline, you know, Obama's meet with.
[01:45:57.116 --> 01:45:59.477]  Promoters of date rape.
[01:46:00.478 --> 01:46:06.141]  And then everybody takes the videos and points out what incredible hypocrites these people are.
[01:46:06.161 --> 01:46:10.824]  I mean, they're beyond hypocritical because the magnitude is five, ten times what the edited Trump tape is.
[01:46:10.884 --> 01:46:16.747]  But again, it goes to, you've been around Washington, you've been around state houses, you've been around this world.
[01:46:17.467 --> 01:46:21.972]  Uh, Gerald, why is Hollywood really out to get the average American?
[01:46:22.412 --> 01:46:27.498]  Why is there this crazy, anti-Christian, anti-free market garbage?
[01:46:28.339 --> 01:46:36.387]  Uh, I mean, I know you're a political atheist, so am I, but when we look at this, there really is, like, by the elite that run this country, like, they've got...
[01:46:37.188 --> 01:46:45.539]  It's like they're in a pissing contest with a ghost of America that doesn't even exist anymore, and they're running us in the ground, and they're lying, and the climate's gotten so crazy.
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:50.566]  Is this the death throes of this establishment, or is this just the beginning of the madness?
[01:46:51.727 --> 01:46:55.148]  It's because you got a bunch of low-life freaks running the show.
[01:46:55.648 --> 01:47:01.130]  Again, let's compare the Obamas to, there used to be a guy most people never heard of him.
[01:47:01.570 --> 01:47:09.612]  His name was General Dwight D. Eisenhower, five-star general, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, and a two-term president.
[01:47:10.213 --> 01:47:13.494]  You know who one of his great friends were that he used to bring to the White House?
[01:47:14.054 --> 01:47:15.454]  They never heard of this guy.
[01:47:16.014 --> 01:47:17.315]  Louis Armstrong.
[01:47:18.325 --> 01:47:18.845]  That's right.
[01:47:18.885 --> 01:47:22.487]  They used to call him the ambassador of goodwill.
[01:47:23.207 --> 01:47:34.013]  Louis Armstrong, this great jazz performer, traveled behind the Iron Curtain all over the world, bringing what the world loved the best about America.
[01:47:34.333 --> 01:47:35.534]  It's great music.
[01:47:35.614 --> 01:47:36.494]  It's jazz.
[01:47:36.874 --> 01:47:45.719]  We've gone from fine elegance and jazz and Louis Armstrong and Dwight D. Eisenhower to a lot of bad rap.
[01:47:45.959 --> 01:47:47.920]  And I've had it with this bad rap.
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:49.761]  I don't want to hear it.
[01:47:49.841 --> 01:47:51.002]  And it's not music.
[01:47:51.363 --> 01:47:52.784]  I don't want to hear that either.
[01:47:53.124 --> 01:47:54.125]  It's rap.
[01:47:54.485 --> 01:47:56.627]  My mama says I'm a poet.
[01:47:56.887 --> 01:47:58.709]  I call you on my cell phone.
[01:47:59.089 --> 01:48:00.830]  I call you on my cell phone.
[01:48:01.111 --> 01:48:02.492]  It ain't music, Jack.
[01:48:02.792 --> 01:48:03.813]  It's your attitude.
[01:48:04.113 --> 01:48:05.715]  There's not an instrument in it.
[01:48:05.735 --> 01:48:08.678]  There's not a fine musician playing it.
[01:48:09.039 --> 01:48:10.640]  It's all your attitude.
[01:48:10.881 --> 01:48:12.643]  And that's what this country's become.
[01:48:13.384 --> 01:48:15.146]  One bad rap.
[01:48:15.466 --> 01:48:18.249]  And we got a two-bit rapper that was a
[01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:39.606]  A community organizer in Chicago, that would be nowhere if he didn't have all that dough, and now he's out there kissing them up again, 43rd time out in Hollywood, and they closed down the joint, so we the little people can't even travel around as old presidents.
[01:48:39.626 --> 01:48:41.187]  Well, Gerald Salenta, you're on fire.
[01:48:41.347 --> 01:48:42.748]  I think you've hit on something here.
[01:48:43.209 --> 01:48:45.751]  This is the rise of the con artist, because you look at
[01:48:46.371 --> 01:48:50.754]  You look at anybody from Michelle Obama to Michael Moore to Hillary Clinton.
[01:48:51.034 --> 01:48:56.638]  It's all a confidence game and they just spew crazier and crazier BS all the time.
[01:48:56.898 --> 01:48:58.339]  They're actually losing credibility.
[01:48:58.579 --> 01:49:00.721]  The evidence we see is a huge landslide for Trump.
[01:49:01.021 --> 01:49:02.102]  They're getting ready to steal it.
[01:49:02.122 --> 01:49:04.043]  They're bringing in the UN to run the elections.
[01:49:04.543 --> 01:49:16.251]  I mean this has really reached Twilight Zone level and I look at the con game and the confidence game of the swagger of Obama and the swagger of Biden and I think they're mentally ill and are megalomaniacs and are smoking their own
[01:49:16.291 --> 01:49:16.531]  Dope.
[01:49:17.631 --> 01:49:19.372]  Well, again, hey, smoking their own dope.
[01:49:19.592 --> 01:49:20.072]  What do you think?
[01:49:20.112 --> 01:49:22.053]  These rappers are straight, man.
[01:49:22.073 --> 01:49:23.993]  Are they ever straight?
[01:49:24.633 --> 01:49:25.154]  What do you think?
[01:49:25.194 --> 01:49:27.034]  They're not doing drugs over there.
[01:49:27.434 --> 01:49:27.934]  Come on.
[01:49:28.195 --> 01:49:29.475]  Look who they're bringing there.
[01:49:30.695 --> 01:49:31.896]  Look what they talk about.
[01:49:31.916 --> 01:49:34.556]  These cats are high, man.
[01:49:35.077 --> 01:49:39.338]  But hey, when they go low, we go high.
[01:49:40.393 --> 01:49:45.949]  I know funding ISIS would take over, starting war with Russia, and I have liberals just laugh at me and say, so do we have a war with Russia.
[01:49:46.250 --> 01:49:48.115]  I mean, it's just like total mental illness has set in.
[01:49:49.019 --> 01:49:50.299]  Well look at Hillary Clinton!
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:52.240]  Look, listen to her speech over there!
[01:49:54.021 --> 01:49:55.441]  These aren't debates either.
[01:49:55.461 --> 01:49:57.542]  These are presidential reality shows.
[01:49:57.762 --> 01:50:00.243]  You have two minutes to talk about your foreign policy.
[01:50:00.523 --> 01:50:01.924]  And what's a foreign policy?
[01:50:02.424 --> 01:50:03.144]  More war.
[01:50:03.564 --> 01:50:04.605]  No fly zone.
[01:50:04.825 --> 01:50:06.706]  Oh, you're talking about those Hollywood creeps?
[01:50:07.006 --> 01:50:16.369]  They're holding a $100,000-a-plate dinner right now as we speak for Obamas to raise money for the Democrats.
[01:50:16.729 --> 01:50:17.970]  These little low-life
[01:50:18.610 --> 01:50:22.291]  Scum wouldn't give us one penny for occupied peace.
[01:50:22.692 --> 01:50:23.532]  Not a penny!
[01:50:23.852 --> 01:50:25.873]  But boy, do they give money for war.
[01:50:26.213 --> 01:50:34.296]  Anybody that votes for Hillary Clinton, all you women out there that don't like Trump's talk, you are an accomplice to murder.
[01:50:34.636 --> 01:50:41.359]  Hillary Clinton said it on the last debate, no fly zone over Syria.
[01:50:41.879 --> 01:50:44.020]  And we're going to do more fighting.
[01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:45.440]  War wars!
[01:50:45.541 --> 01:50:53.944]  And back in the wrong people, and Gerald, don't forget, she said if we have any unsubstantiated cyber attack from the territory of Russia, hit them militarily.
[01:50:54.905 --> 01:50:55.345]  You got it.
[01:50:55.725 --> 01:50:57.866]  And meanwhile she's got a secret, hold on, we're gonna come back from break.
[01:50:58.306 --> 01:51:02.088]  Meanwhile we have a Secret Service guy basically holding her up telling her it's okay, it's okay.
[01:51:02.328 --> 01:51:04.609]  Her mind is gone half the time.
[01:51:04.629 --> 01:51:06.730]  She's obviously hopped up on methamphetamine.
[01:51:06.970 --> 01:51:07.570]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:09.602 --> 01:51:11.024]  I said to Donald, here's what they're doing.
[01:51:11.044 --> 01:51:12.345]  They're setting it up as follows.
[01:51:12.965 --> 01:51:18.811]  For three, four months, they've been saying the Russians are hacking our elections to protect our elections, which is sacred.
[01:51:19.232 --> 01:51:20.913]  We want to turn it over to DHS.
[01:51:20.933 --> 01:51:24.857]  The genius has given us one terrorist attack after another and has done nothing to stop it.
[01:51:24.877 --> 01:51:25.898]  He still has his job, right?
[01:51:26.419 --> 01:51:28.881]  So he wants to make sure our elections are safe.
[01:51:29.202 --> 01:51:30.002]  Russians are hacking.
[01:51:30.723 --> 01:51:31.844]  Follow the bouncing ball.
[01:51:31.904 --> 01:51:32.485]  No proof.
[01:51:32.845 --> 01:51:44.335]  If Trump wins, which is highly likely, by the way, which we can talk about in a minute or two or another time, Trump wins, government declares, oh, we have evidence that the Russians hacked it.
[01:51:44.935 --> 01:51:45.916]  He's a friend of Putin.
[01:51:46.217 --> 01:51:47.638]  The election is null and void.
[01:51:48.078 --> 01:51:50.941]  We're going to recall another election in, what, six months.
[01:51:50.981 --> 01:51:54.043]  Until then, Mr. Obama has graciously agreed
[01:51:55.004 --> 01:51:58.287]  To continue his public service in the United States of America.
[01:51:58.627 --> 01:51:59.428]  Thank you very much.
[01:51:59.468 --> 01:52:00.609]  We're not taking any questions.
[01:52:00.649 --> 01:52:01.090]  Goodbye.
[01:52:03.192 --> 01:52:11.900]  And we have Biden announcing they're going to launch a giant cyber attack on the Russians and saying if the Russians respond, they may respond militarily, which is a doctrine Hillary came out with two months ago.
[01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:14.582]  And suddenly NATO announced that's their new doctrine.
[01:52:14.802 --> 01:52:16.264]  She's literally calling the show.
[01:52:17.614 --> 01:52:20.477]  All I wanted to say was, I said it to Donald and he didn't take the bait.
[01:52:20.517 --> 01:52:21.098]  I'm glad he didn't.
[01:52:21.158 --> 01:52:24.561]  I said, don't even answer me, because they'll crucify you if you agree with me.
[01:52:25.562 --> 01:52:27.284]  They're going to steal the election.
[01:52:27.444 --> 01:52:28.225]  I'll make it simple.
[01:52:28.265 --> 01:52:31.027]  In the fifth grade, I ran for class president in Queens, New York.
[01:52:32.028 --> 01:52:32.949]  I was a funny kid.
[01:52:33.009 --> 01:52:33.870]  I was a wild kid.
[01:52:33.890 --> 01:52:34.631]  I was out of control.
[01:52:34.691 --> 01:52:36.193]  I won the election by a landslide.
[01:52:36.753 --> 01:52:40.635]  The teacher stood up and said, this election doesn't count.
[01:52:41.275 --> 01:52:44.176]  She had another election, and I wasn't class president.
[01:52:44.596 --> 01:52:49.298]  So, hey, look, if it could be done in the fifth grade in the Bronx when I was a kid, why can't they do it to us now, right?
[01:52:49.318 --> 01:52:49.998]  We're just children.
[01:52:50.018 --> 01:52:51.599]  I had a similar thing happen.
[01:52:51.619 --> 01:52:54.920]  You know, when you really do things in this world, you start to learn how rigged they are.
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:58.402]  And it's just crazy to see them go, even though it's the same newscast.
[01:52:59.122 --> 01:53:00.443]  The Russians are rigging the election.
[01:53:00.763 --> 01:53:02.704]  We're having to bring in the UN to oversee it.
[01:53:02.744 --> 01:53:04.125]  And then meanwhile, Trump's crazy.
[01:53:04.385 --> 01:53:07.847]  He says they're rigging the election, even as we catch election officials admitting the fraud.
[01:53:08.047 --> 01:53:09.367]  We do have a minute or two more if you've got it.
[01:53:09.868 --> 01:53:10.928]  Elaborate on what you're saying.
[01:53:10.948 --> 01:53:11.609]  I mean, I agree.
[01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:14.850]  The internal polls, I know from Trump, but also other big groups are doing internal polls.
[01:53:15.391 --> 01:53:17.472]  5, 10, 15 points ahead in most battleground states.
[01:53:17.792 --> 01:53:19.032]  He's going to win in a landslide.
[01:53:19.273 --> 01:53:22.954]  They're only creating the perception he's way behind, so we buy it right now.
[01:53:22.974 --> 01:53:23.835]  Do you concur with that?
[01:53:24.015 --> 01:53:25.616]  A. B. What happens when he gets in?
[01:53:26.518 --> 01:53:26.719]  100% right.
[01:53:26.759 --> 01:53:27.882]  You and I think the same way.
[01:53:27.922 --> 01:53:29.788]  I said that to Donald yesterday on my radio show.
[01:53:29.828 --> 01:53:30.069]  I said...
[01:53:31.967 --> 01:53:36.950]  Donald, I said what they're doing is they're not trying to get Hillary people to vote for Hillary.
[01:53:36.970 --> 01:53:38.932]  They've got all the people they could ever, ever get.
[01:53:38.952 --> 01:53:45.116]  I said what they're trying to do is discourage Trump voters from voting by thinking that it's over already.
[01:53:45.136 --> 01:53:47.738]  They're trying to make them think that he lost, that she won.
[01:53:47.758 --> 01:53:49.999]  So they're going to throw their hands up and not vote for him.
[01:53:50.279 --> 01:53:53.782]  He's got to make sure that people think he can still win, which he can.
[01:53:54.722 --> 01:53:59.565]  And then if all of us who are supporting him come out, I think he will win.
[01:53:59.785 --> 01:54:00.446]  It's that simple.
[01:54:00.626 --> 01:54:00.926]  That's right.
[01:54:00.946 --> 01:54:02.187]  You can't steal landslides.
[01:54:02.227 --> 01:54:06.692]  I've interviewed experts who are Democrats, Republicans, die-bold engineers from the highest levels.
[01:54:06.712 --> 01:54:07.152]  They agree.
[01:54:07.833 --> 01:54:09.474]  You cannot steal a landslide.
[01:54:23.067 --> 01:54:29.229]  By the way, we're going to be broadcasting for two days live on the day of the election right through the next day.
[01:54:29.829 --> 01:54:31.089]  Probably going to be a major circus.
[01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:32.930]  We're already getting election fraud all over Texas.
[01:54:33.770 --> 01:54:35.090]  We just go with the facts, folks.
[01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:36.530]  They stole it from Gore.
[01:54:36.731 --> 01:54:37.651]  I'm nonpartisan.
[01:54:38.631 --> 01:54:40.291]  They're stealing this from Trump right now.
[01:54:40.932 --> 01:54:41.772]  It's overwhelming.
[01:54:44.488 --> 01:54:45.409]  The stakes are so huge.
[01:54:45.429 --> 01:54:57.377]  I wanted to bring Joe Biggs in, because he'll be covering this more tonight on the Nightly News, but more of the WikiLeaks have come out with data dumps, 17 or 18, from Podesta emails, where they say, keep us in the dark, keep us dumb, rig the polls, steal the election.
[01:54:58.117 --> 01:55:01.379]  You know, hey, we're run by the Russians, or at least funded by them, so let's blame Trump.
[01:55:01.419 --> 01:55:02.200]  I mean, it's all there.
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:03.961]  It's so incredible.
[01:55:04.021 --> 01:55:06.283]  How does she survive this, even if she cheats and gets in?
[01:55:07.003 --> 01:55:07.223]  I don't
[01:55:24.838 --> 01:55:29.702]  Fake, fake email to get around the foyer, to get around the Firm Information Act.
[01:55:30.102 --> 01:55:34.966]  Well yeah, last month we got information from Huma Abedin and an email says, how is this not classified?
[01:55:35.247 --> 01:55:43.994]  Obama used a code name to talk with Hillary on her personal email as new FBI records reveal that even her top aide, Huma, was shocked by unsecure... And that's Daily Mail.
[01:55:44.034 --> 01:55:45.275]  So now though, it goes further.
[01:55:45.475 --> 01:55:46.156]  Here's what they were saying.
[01:56:05.683 --> 01:56:05.883]  I don't
[01:56:24.568 --> 01:56:30.569]  That he's using these, but he goes on TV and he goes, well, I found out about it like you did on TV.
[01:56:30.689 --> 01:56:31.490]  I didn't know anything.
[01:56:31.590 --> 01:56:38.591]  And again, the issue is they're sending generals to prison for literally nothing because they took a few documents home in their briefcase.
[01:56:38.751 --> 01:56:44.093]  These are people in charge of our national security and they're sitting there talking about how the Russians are the ones hacking.
[01:56:44.333 --> 01:56:45.733]  No, anybody could have figured this out.
[01:56:45.913 --> 01:56:47.314]  We're gonna go to the next segment with Gerald Salenti.
[01:56:47.494 --> 01:56:48.835]  We only got six, seven minutes left with him.
[01:56:49.075 --> 01:56:49.715]  We're about to go to break.
[01:56:49.735 --> 01:57:01.342]  But Gerald, what do you make of this whole WikiLeaks phenomenon where there's all the proof, everything we ever said, foreign global government wanting to make us dumb, wanting to bankrupt us, wanting to keep us stupid, laughing at us.
[01:57:01.402 --> 01:57:02.282]  I mean, these are demons.
[01:57:02.302 --> 01:57:03.303]  They talk like criminals.
[01:57:04.329 --> 01:57:07.831]  Yeah, and the mainstream media is hardly covering it at all.
[01:57:08.492 --> 01:57:10.673]  And it's a neo-feudal society.
[01:57:10.693 --> 01:57:27.404]  There's different rules that we, the little people, who have to obey every letter of the law, and the criminals, the economic elite and the political nobility, that could steal all our money, lie, cheat, take us to war based on lies, and they get no time at all.
[01:57:27.424 --> 01:57:32.588]  Have all the rappers saying, rape women at the White House, hanging out with their kids, and then Trump and some secret tape, he's the devil?
[01:57:32.628 --> 01:57:33.048]  Exactly.
[01:57:33.068 --> 01:57:34.029]  Total hypocrisy.
[01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:41.375]  Total, total, and that's my anger, is the hypocrisy and the arrogance of the Obamas.
[01:57:42.076 --> 01:57:48.861]  Oh, and all those little liberals out there, by the way, I know they're not listening to your show, and I know you love Clintons.
[01:57:49.141 --> 01:57:52.644]  You like those GMOs, you like those bovines.
[01:57:52.684 --> 01:57:54.046]  That's another point you point out.
[01:57:54.106 --> 01:57:55.667]  The Clintons are the ones that rammed it all through.
[01:57:55.847 --> 01:57:56.327]  Tell them.
[01:57:57.128 --> 01:57:57.689]  You got it.
[01:57:58.329 --> 01:57:59.431]  There were no such thing.
[01:57:59.531 --> 01:58:00.852]  They allowed that to happen.
[01:58:01.333 --> 01:58:03.275]  They've sold us out so much.
[01:58:03.635 --> 01:58:04.976]  Listen to her last speech.
[01:58:05.016 --> 01:58:11.143]  As I said, anyone that votes for Hillary Clinton is an accessory to murder.
[01:58:11.864 --> 01:58:16.268]  You've seen the clips when they asked her how she felt when Gaddafi was killed.
[01:58:17.130 --> 01:58:19.672]  We came, we saw, he died.
[01:58:20.032 --> 01:58:22.773]  And now she's talking about putting a no-fly zone... No, wait, she did it worse than that.
[01:58:22.793 --> 01:58:23.574]  Let me do the imitation.
[01:58:24.334 --> 01:58:25.735]  We came, we saw, he died.
[01:58:29.017 --> 01:58:35.961]  Yeah, so anyone that votes for her is voting... If you know... I say, hey, listen, Alex.
[01:58:36.401 --> 01:58:38.323]  I need some money to buy some guns.
[01:58:38.403 --> 01:58:39.763]  I want to kill some people.
[01:58:40.264 --> 01:58:42.045]  And you give me the money to buy those guns.
[01:58:42.065 --> 01:58:42.665]  I'm an accessory.
[01:58:43.446 --> 01:58:43.966]  You got it.
[01:58:44.671 --> 01:58:51.099]  Everyone that votes Democratic for Hillary Clinton is an accessory to mass murder!
[01:58:51.620 --> 01:58:52.481]  Go to Libya!
[01:59:00.333 --> 01:59:03.675]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.
[01:59:03.915 --> 01:59:05.596]  Minor words and his was action.
[01:59:06.176 --> 01:59:07.717]  His was what he's done to women.
[01:59:07.737 --> 01:59:13.421]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[01:59:13.641 --> 01:59:15.962]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[01:59:16.322 --> 01:59:21.225]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.
[01:59:21.305 --> 01:59:22.506]  Four of them here tonight.
[01:59:22.626 --> 01:59:27.929]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[01:59:38.769 --> 01:59:41.510]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[01:59:42.370 --> 01:59:43.811]  It's a fight for our minds.
[01:59:44.471 --> 01:59:46.412]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[01:59:46.732 --> 01:59:50.953]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:59:51.073 --> 01:59:54.434]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[01:59:54.514 --> 01:59:56.115]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:59:56.335 --> 01:59:56.975]  Take action!
[02:00:02.197 --> 02:00:04.878]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:13.900 --> 02:00:17.541]  Before America can be great again, it must be free again.
[02:00:21.823 --> 02:00:26.865]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[02:00:27.365 --> 02:00:30.046]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:34.983 --> 02:00:39.185]  I was thinking this morning about history.
[02:00:39.706 --> 02:00:41.187]  About what America really stands for.
[02:00:43.428 --> 02:00:48.132]  And later in the broadcast I'll spend a couple minutes on it to try to crystallize it, but...
[02:00:52.301 --> 02:00:55.922]  The reason they demonized the West is because it has an idea of freedom.
[02:00:56.623 --> 02:01:00.984]  Not that we ever even attained it, but just the grasping at that took us to levels we'd never before seen.
[02:01:01.925 --> 02:01:02.725]  Joel Celentes is with us.
[02:01:02.945 --> 02:01:03.785]  I want to invite him back.
[02:01:04.486 --> 02:01:06.786]  He's probably the fan favorite for the show.
[02:01:06.806 --> 02:01:07.647]  I know he's a busy guy.
[02:01:07.987 --> 02:01:08.847]  He should be on every week.
[02:01:08.987 --> 02:01:10.228]  My God, he does his own shows as well.
[02:01:10.268 --> 02:01:12.629]  You can find out about those at TrendsResearch.com.
[02:01:12.669 --> 02:01:16.290]  And it's good to know there's other great people out there that are pissed off, because here's the deal.
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:19.041]  I'm successful in life.
[02:01:19.061 --> 02:01:19.802]  Gerald's successful.
[02:01:20.162 --> 02:01:27.489]  We could do our own thing, but I hate seeing these scammers screw everybody and then laugh about it and then destroy our prosperity.
[02:01:28.209 --> 02:01:31.973]  You're going to ride a little shotgun with me when Mark Moreno joins us here, but pop at any time.
[02:01:31.993 --> 02:01:38.699]  But just in closing, Gerald, we're going to be broadcasting for 48 hours live, starting right through the election and the day after it.
[02:01:39.892 --> 02:01:42.933]  And I would like to invite you to pop in several times for a full hour if you'd like.
[02:01:42.953 --> 02:01:46.894]  We're getting millions of people outside of even our terrestrial radio audience that come in.
[02:01:46.914 --> 02:01:56.516]  And I think that's a bellwether of hope that InfoWars does these live events now and the smallest shows get like a million people to tune in when we used to do a few hours.
[02:01:56.897 --> 02:01:57.817]  There's just internet only.
[02:01:58.157 --> 02:01:59.357]  Sometimes four or five million.
[02:01:59.377 --> 02:02:00.718]  This is getting very, very exciting.
[02:02:00.758 --> 02:02:05.579]  I think we're going to have 10 million viewers just on our streams coming up.
[02:02:06.869 --> 02:02:11.211]  Well, first of all, I'd love to be on, but secondly, you are the future and the present.
[02:02:11.752 --> 02:02:19.956]  What you are doing, and myself, and InfoWars, and the team of people that you have, you're the voice.
[02:02:20.016 --> 02:02:21.497]  There's no voice anymore.
[02:02:22.110 --> 02:02:22.970]  Look what's going on.
[02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:25.551]  Just pick up today's, yesterday's, today's papers.
[02:02:26.112 --> 02:02:28.352]  Newspapers are firing people daily.
[02:02:28.773 --> 02:02:30.253]  They're shrinking the news hole.
[02:02:30.613 --> 02:02:35.475]  You turn on the major media, it's the same clowns that you hear over and over again.
[02:02:35.855 --> 02:02:39.017]  You are the present and you are the future.
[02:02:39.357 --> 02:02:40.357]  This is the way.
[02:02:40.677 --> 02:02:44.379]  And after this election, it's even going to become much bigger.
[02:02:45.519 --> 02:02:47.760]  And that's why they openly say they're coming after our free speech.
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:48.661]  They've announced that.
[02:02:48.721 --> 02:02:49.541]  Will they be successful?
[02:02:50.768 --> 02:02:50.988]  No.
[02:02:51.769 --> 02:02:54.231]  Unless they kill us, which they may well do.
[02:02:54.691 --> 02:02:57.053]  I mean, look at the track record that they have.
[02:02:58.574 --> 02:03:02.317]  No, I agree with you, and they've even got their fans saying it's time to basically arrest us.
[02:03:02.977 --> 02:03:04.759]  They've even got major publications saying that, Gerald.
[02:03:04.779 --> 02:03:08.081]  That's why I'm glad you're there and so many others are there, because I think we've reached a tipping point.
[02:03:08.101 --> 02:03:12.505]  We've got enough people on air that know what's happening, and before it was just a few of us, now there's quite a few.
[02:03:12.545 --> 02:03:13.886]  I think that brings a lot of safety.
[02:03:14.892 --> 02:03:17.776]  Well again, the people are disgusted with what's going on.
[02:03:18.036 --> 02:03:19.618]  Look what's going on around Europe.
[02:03:19.979 --> 02:03:22.682]  With all these parties, populist parties.
[02:03:23.003 --> 02:03:24.385]  Yeah, populist for us.
[02:03:24.945 --> 02:03:30.313]  The AFD, the Alternative for Deutschland, the Freedom Party, Le Pen's party.
[02:03:30.333 --> 02:03:30.913]  Catalonians!
[02:03:32.089 --> 02:03:32.890]  One after another.
[02:03:33.291 --> 02:03:34.972]  So we can do it too.
[02:03:35.553 --> 02:03:40.278]  And your voice is bigger than anyone else's out there.
[02:03:40.539 --> 02:03:44.403]  That's putting out the alternative message for peace, freedom, and prosperity.
[02:03:44.423 --> 02:03:45.044]  And you know what scared me?
[02:03:45.064 --> 02:03:50.850]  The Washington Post and even the American Statesman admitted in articles last week that Infowars is bigger than anything out there.
[02:03:51.170 --> 02:03:53.173]  They now know the metrics and they're crapping their pants.
[02:03:54.357 --> 02:03:58.619]  Look, you turn into any of these, you know the data coming out of CNN and the others.
[02:03:59.219 --> 02:04:00.199]  They're in the tank.
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:02.260]  Nobody's listening to them.
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:03.240]  Average show, 100,000 viewers.
[02:04:04.581 --> 02:04:04.781]  Yeah.
[02:04:06.042 --> 02:04:07.802]  So you're the future and the present.
[02:04:07.882 --> 02:04:09.083]  This is where it's going.
[02:04:09.383 --> 02:04:12.504]  And after this election, it's only going to get bigger.
[02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:21.231]  Man, I tell you, I mean, I know that we just do, you do what's right, Gerald, and it's not that Trump's perfect, but obviously he's a populist, they're against him.
[02:04:21.691 --> 02:04:25.413]  But I don't want to get Machiavelli in here, but if he gets in, it's going to be a hard road.
[02:04:25.453 --> 02:04:29.814]  It's almost better if Hillary gets in, because it'll totally destroy the whole system, or maybe I'm wrong.
[02:04:30.586 --> 02:04:31.367]  I don't think so.
[02:04:31.447 --> 02:04:34.008]  I think if Trump gets in, there would be very big changes.
[02:04:34.088 --> 02:04:37.190]  Again, I don't agree with him on a lot, but I agree with him on some.
[02:04:37.210 --> 02:04:41.333]  No, no, obviously he will do stuff that will help our economy and stuff, but I'm saying then they'll try to sabotage him.
[02:04:41.573 --> 02:04:45.156]  We get Hillary, it goes to rock bottom, but I agree, we gotta get Trump in, because she wants to start World War III.
[02:04:45.856 --> 02:04:47.376]  There's no Congress.
[02:04:47.456 --> 02:04:48.677]  That's the other thing.
[02:04:49.457 --> 02:04:51.738]  There's nobody there to stop anybody.
[02:04:51.758 --> 02:04:53.758]  There are a bunch of... Look at the people.
[02:04:53.778 --> 02:04:54.398]  Look at the names.
[02:04:54.418 --> 02:04:55.438]  Well, Gerald, you're on fire.
[02:04:55.538 --> 02:04:57.159]  Please come back this week if you'll do it.
[02:04:57.199 --> 02:04:58.939]  And please, you know, join us a lot.
[02:04:58.959 --> 02:04:59.479]  Gerald Cilenta.
[02:04:59.499 --> 02:05:01.460]  People can find his show and more at TrendsResearch.com.
[02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:02.360]  God bless you.
[02:05:02.380 --> 02:05:02.900]  You're amazing.
[02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:04.781]  Thank you very much for having me.
[02:05:04.841 --> 02:05:05.761]  Thank you for all you do.
[02:05:05.881 --> 02:05:06.141]  Thank you.
[02:05:06.161 --> 02:05:07.301]  He's on target about these rappers.
[02:05:07.341 --> 02:05:08.902]  We've got to expose their hypocrisy.
[02:05:08.942 --> 02:05:09.302]  We'll be back.
[02:05:09.722 --> 02:05:12.003]  We are living in very perilous times.
[02:05:12.563 --> 02:05:18.624]  Things seem to be spinning out of control much faster than the powers that be can handle them.
[02:05:19.444 --> 02:05:28.106]  They've created these structures, these forces in the world that are now beyond their grasp.
[02:05:28.726 --> 02:05:30.446]  They've created things.
[02:05:30.466 --> 02:05:32.007]  They created ISIS, for example.
[02:05:32.647 --> 02:05:37.728]  They created the civil war, which became a regional war in Syria.
[02:05:39.029 --> 02:05:41.571]  And all of these things have spun out of control.
[02:05:42.972 --> 02:05:47.256]  It's like Yates's poem, you know, spinning and spinning in a winding gyre.
[02:05:48.277 --> 02:05:50.379]  That's the situation we're in now.
[02:05:51.260 --> 02:05:55.704]  And we are, as you mentioned, very near the brink of a third world war.
[02:05:56.783 --> 02:06:14.694]  And we have Hillary Clinton, for the sake of political gain, playing brinksmanship, pushing toward activating a no-fly zone over Syria, which would indeed be a severe provocation.
[02:06:14.774 --> 02:06:19.958]  All it takes is one or two Russian aircraft being shot down.
[02:06:21.238 --> 02:06:22.419]  And it'll be game on.
[02:06:23.019 --> 02:06:31.984]  You know, not only is she running a kleptocratic system, but when she's personally a kleptomaniac, what does that tell you?
[02:06:34.566 --> 02:06:37.848]  I cannot believe that this woman is being seriously considered.
[02:06:38.568 --> 02:06:54.703]  As a presidential candidate, and with just the torrent of information that's coming out of WikiLeaks right now, from within the DNC, from within the Clinton Foundation, it just absolutely boggles the mind to think that she's being considered seriously.
[02:06:56.733 --> 02:07:11.403]  We have a situation where we may have a manipulated presidential election, may have a split outcome with a difference between the popular vote and the electoral vote, and we have a
[02:07:13.177 --> 02:07:26.781]  A kind of a criminal power structure in place right now that's willing to either collapse the system or bring the world to another world war just for the sake of furthering their own power.
[02:07:27.461 --> 02:07:30.782]  That's how absolutely corrupt and evil they are.
[02:07:31.663 --> 02:07:41.966]  It's amazing to see so many people with such corrupt morals and so downright sociopathic or psychopathic.
[02:07:43.047 --> 02:07:47.070]  It's the United States that's the provocateur here.
[02:07:47.310 --> 02:07:49.933]  We're the one provoking Russia.
[02:07:50.073 --> 02:07:52.395]  And we've been at it for four years with Ukraine.
[02:07:52.515 --> 02:07:54.717]  And that game has turned into brinksmanship.
[02:08:32.097 --> 02:08:34.278]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:34.719 --> 02:08:39.981]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:08:40.482 --> 02:08:44.704]  Alright, they tried to get him arrested when he was in Paris premiering this film earlier this year.
[02:08:44.724 --> 02:08:49.847]  He was a former top advisor to Congress on climate change, to the committees.
[02:08:50.587 --> 02:08:51.167]  He's Mark Moreno.
[02:08:52.408 --> 02:08:59.352]  He of course helped honcho with Lord Monks and others the release of the emails and information proving they were hiding the decline six years ago and covering up what's happening.
[02:08:59.372 --> 02:09:00.493]  It's all about a carbon tax.
[02:09:00.553 --> 02:09:02.694]  Now they're trying to pass laws here in the U.S.
[02:09:03.495 --> 02:09:05.316]  to arrest people that deny climate change.
[02:09:05.336 --> 02:09:07.117]  Well, we don't deny the climate change.
[02:09:07.137 --> 02:09:08.217]  We're saying it isn't man-made.
[02:09:09.238 --> 02:09:10.239]  And then separately...
[02:09:11.078 --> 02:09:14.863]  Russia's coming out saying it's a carbon tax, a shutdown country, so they want to sanction them for it.
[02:09:15.224 --> 02:09:17.126]  They've been meeting with, what is it, 15 attorney generals?
[02:09:17.827 --> 02:09:19.910]  Trying to figure out ways to indict Mark Moreno.
[02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:22.073]  So, I mean, they mentioned Mark Moreno.
[02:09:22.253 --> 02:09:25.918]  Okay, they want to arrest this guy, whether you agree with him or not.
[02:09:25.958 --> 02:09:27.521]  And by the way, they say the science is settled.
[02:09:29.394 --> 02:09:30.535]  That's all part of the mind control.
[02:09:30.555 --> 02:09:32.035]  The science is anything but settled.
[02:09:32.856 --> 02:09:39.579]  From their perspective, I mean, carbon dioxide, we're at a very low point in our history, but I'm not going to get into that, okay?
[02:09:40.379 --> 02:09:43.121]  The point is, is that this is social control over energy.
[02:09:43.501 --> 02:09:44.782]  We're now carrying the DVD.
[02:09:44.922 --> 02:09:45.642]  It just came out.
[02:09:46.202 --> 02:09:49.564]  It's Climate Hustle, available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:09:49.664 --> 02:09:51.245]  Extremely powerful.
[02:09:51.725 --> 02:09:52.606]  Show it to your church.
[02:09:52.666 --> 02:09:54.987]  Show it to your local library.
[02:09:55.087 --> 02:09:56.167]  Donate a copy to the library.
[02:09:56.207 --> 02:09:57.248]  It'll be watched hundreds of times.
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:03.648]  There's no reviews yet because it just went on sale today, but the reviews from other critics have been astounding.
[02:10:03.728 --> 02:10:07.454]  And again, working with Lord Monks and others, they got it where they pulled the whole...
[02:10:08.658 --> 02:10:13.764]  Inconvenient fraud movie and Inconvenient Truth by Al Gore out of British schools because it was all lies.
[02:10:13.804 --> 02:10:15.586]  You know, polar bears can't swim and all this other crap.
[02:10:16.547 --> 02:10:22.513]  This is what they do, ladies and gentlemen, to create this guilt and then take over the entire environmental movement and distract it.
[02:10:22.553 --> 02:10:23.554]  But tremendous.
[02:10:23.614 --> 02:10:26.677]  Cal Thomas, Dynamite, Breitbart News, National Review.
[02:10:26.998 --> 02:10:28.540]  Brutal and extremely funny.
[02:10:29.761 --> 02:10:30.542]  Climate hustle.
[02:10:31.926 --> 02:10:33.107]  Are they trying to control climate?
[02:10:33.727 --> 02:10:34.127]  Or you?
[02:10:34.647 --> 02:10:37.589]  You've got to get it now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:10:37.609 --> 02:10:40.390]  That way you're supporting the great work of Mark Moreno.
[02:10:40.410 --> 02:10:41.490]  You're supporting the InfoWars.
[02:10:41.530 --> 02:10:42.611]  It's a 360 win.
[02:10:42.651 --> 02:10:44.272]  Joe Biggs is riding shotgun with me for the hour.
[02:10:44.292 --> 02:10:46.193]  I just add commentary anytime he likes.
[02:10:46.213 --> 02:10:47.993]  Working on a bunch of investigative reports right now.
[02:10:48.013 --> 02:10:54.637]  We have Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, and the media's figured out one of his only advisors he listens to.
[02:10:54.657 --> 02:10:57.058]  That's the great part about Trump is he listens to anybody.
[02:10:57.958 --> 02:10:58.819]  Unless you're straight shooting.
[02:10:58.979 --> 02:10:59.640]  That's the big secret.
[02:11:00.841 --> 02:11:02.763]  And it's just like a pitch to a boss.
[02:11:02.783 --> 02:11:05.946]  You just hit him, and then if he gets the pitch, then you got Trump's here.
[02:11:06.327 --> 02:11:07.588]  Everybody else he doesn't listen to.
[02:11:07.648 --> 02:11:09.250]  But they're totally flipping out.
[02:11:09.270 --> 02:11:10.631]  He's way ahead in real polls.
[02:11:10.992 --> 02:11:12.253]  That's why they're getting ready to try to steal it.
[02:11:12.513 --> 02:11:14.355]  So we'll talk about everything with Mark Moreno.
[02:11:14.636 --> 02:11:16.037]  ClimateDepot.com.
[02:11:17.158 --> 02:11:19.481]  Mr. Moreno, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:11:20.455 --> 02:11:21.476]  Thank you, Alex and Joe.
[02:11:21.496 --> 02:11:22.376]  Happy to be here today.
[02:11:22.456 --> 02:11:22.777]  Thank you.
[02:11:23.097 --> 02:11:24.398]  Well, so much going on.
[02:11:24.418 --> 02:11:25.879]  I mean, let's talk about the film, obviously.
[02:11:26.399 --> 02:11:27.420]  Our listeners are informed.
[02:11:27.780 --> 02:11:29.781]  They need to now get this out there.
[02:11:30.281 --> 02:11:35.585]  Let's talk about the film, what you went through to put it out, why it's so powerful, and then let's get into the current attacks we're witnessing.
[02:11:36.772 --> 02:11:36.992]  Sure.
[02:11:37.052 --> 02:11:42.839]  Okay, the film came out, actually, as you mentioned, Alex, we had our premiere back in Paris last December.
[02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:50.388]  And the morning of our premiere, we had it in a hundred-year-old theater in downtown Paris, right during the United Nations Climate Summit.
[02:11:50.748 --> 02:11:56.976]  They had wanted posters of me all over the city, wanted for being a, quote, climate criminal, the local environmental groups.
[02:11:57.496 --> 02:12:00.840]  And there was a couple other people they went after.
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:06.965]  One of them was an Australian energy CEO who left Paris because they felt like their physical safety was being threatened.
[02:12:06.986 --> 02:12:08.127]  Yeah, this isn't tongue-in-cheek.
[02:12:08.167 --> 02:12:09.048]  This isn't tongue-in-cheek.
[02:12:09.068 --> 02:12:10.349]  They may want you arrested.
[02:12:11.530 --> 02:12:11.890]  They do.
[02:12:11.970 --> 02:12:16.855]  In fact, we have United States Senators pushing racketeering charges against global warming skeptics.
[02:12:16.975 --> 02:12:20.719]  In the film, Alex, Climate Hustle, you get to see Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:12:20.779 --> 02:12:27.305]  say, we need to put climate skeptics at the Hague with three square meals and a cop with all the other war criminals.
[02:12:27.825 --> 02:12:35.295]  And we have NASA's lead global warming scientist talk about trying skeptics for quote crimes against humanity unquote.
[02:12:35.315 --> 02:12:37.518]  Does that phrase sound familiar?
[02:12:37.878 --> 02:12:45.689]  This is what they want to do to skeptics because we're in their way and you're you're making the analogy of you open up about talking about Donald Trump.
[02:12:46.454 --> 02:12:53.578]  In a way, it's almost identical type belittling and trashing and mainstream media attacks on skeptics.
[02:12:53.598 --> 02:13:00.341]  They're trying to make us toxic, put us in jail, minimize us, ridicule, make everyone afraid.
[02:13:00.762 --> 02:13:06.645]  Sure, everybody overuses Nazi analogies, but this is what the Nazis did for five, six years before they started the roundup of Jews.
[02:13:08.100 --> 02:13:15.002]  Well, in fact, in our film, they actually compare climate skeptics to holocaust deniers.
[02:13:15.022 --> 02:13:18.603]  And they'll say a holocaust denier, climate skeptic, there is no difference between them.
[02:13:18.923 --> 02:13:20.383]  And they go through a whole bunch of stuff.
[02:13:20.423 --> 02:13:21.383]  They want us in jail.
[02:13:21.683 --> 02:13:26.665]  They try to tie us to any negative thing in their minds that they can think of.
[02:13:26.685 --> 02:13:27.325]  And so this is
[02:13:28.055 --> 02:13:29.396]  This is where we are right now.
[02:13:29.476 --> 02:13:33.498]  I just got back from Brussels last week and I premiered the film at the EU Parliament.
[02:13:33.938 --> 02:13:39.461]  And we had some global warming activists show up and try to challenge us in the Q&A.
[02:13:39.781 --> 02:13:45.023]  But I was very excited that a lot of members of Parliament showed up from Germany, from the UK.
[02:13:45.223 --> 02:13:48.925]  That's the positive news is, just like Wikileaks, we have the emails.
[02:13:49.745 --> 02:13:51.586]  People forget where they admit it's all a fraud.
[02:13:51.766 --> 02:13:52.727]  I mean, we have them.
[02:13:53.772 --> 02:14:06.545]  Yeah, we have on the emails, called the Climategate Scandal, we have the top scientists of the United Nations essentially admitting in these emails that they are colluding to create a narrative on global warming.
[02:14:07.026 --> 02:14:15.935]  And they openly talk about in the emails, if any scientists disagree, they go after the journal editors that would publish their work, they go after ruining these scientists' career,
[02:14:16.315 --> 02:14:16.395]  True.
[02:14:32.085 --> 02:14:35.067]  I mean, it's just such a paradox where the media is in such lockstep
[02:14:52.035 --> 02:15:01.521]  As they implode, but then, I wonder, will they get across the finish line and bring in authoritarianism as they're calling for to shut down Drudge, to shut down you, to shut down us.
[02:15:01.561 --> 02:15:05.003]  I mean, they all say, you know, I'm a dark heart, I don't have a right to exist.
[02:15:05.063 --> 02:15:09.666]  I mean, now I have Hillary saying my name, her surrogate saying, shut him down, he's evil.
[02:15:10.226 --> 02:15:16.630]  I mean, and you read the newspaper, I'm racist, and then they don't say why I'm racist, or you're a criminal, you need to be hit with racketeering.
[02:15:16.650 --> 02:15:20.372]  They name you by name because you dare, I mean, these people are crazy.
[02:15:23.129 --> 02:15:32.618]  It's gotten to such a point where they honestly believe that they cannot tolerate any debate and the only solution is to shut us down and shut us down completely.
[02:15:32.838 --> 02:15:44.890]  Now, one of the ways they're going to do that now, and they're going after energy, our sources of energy, we had Al Gore attend a New York City press conference with two state's attorney generals, several of them, back in March of this year.
[02:15:45.090 --> 02:15:46.872]  I actually made it to the press conference at the very end.
[02:15:47.492 --> 02:15:49.073]  And they laid out their plan.
[02:15:49.133 --> 02:15:56.056]  What they're going to do, Alex, is they're going to essentially call every weather event now, fossil fuel poisoned weather.
[02:15:56.156 --> 02:15:57.236]  You know, every hurricane.
[02:15:57.256 --> 02:15:58.137]  They're already doing that.
[02:15:58.177 --> 02:15:59.297]  I've seen them beta test.
[02:15:59.457 --> 02:16:00.117]  Anything happens.
[02:16:00.197 --> 02:16:01.198]  I mean, you saw them.
[02:16:01.218 --> 02:16:03.599]  They said the latest hurricane was caused by humans.
[02:16:04.508 --> 02:16:12.290]  And first thing I want to do is that the Washington Post, a former reporter for the Washington Post that actually came out, they're calling for a new metric now, a new way to measure hurricanes.
[02:16:12.490 --> 02:16:12.850]  Why?
[02:16:13.110 --> 02:16:16.090]  Because we're in a historic record low hurricane.
[02:16:16.110 --> 02:16:16.350]  That's right.
[02:16:16.370 --> 02:16:17.231]  The main U.S.
[02:16:17.271 --> 02:16:21.391]  has not been hit in nine years directly by one, the lowest ever recorded in modern history.
[02:16:21.651 --> 02:16:22.772]  That's even the Weather Channel.
[02:16:23.112 --> 02:16:28.853]  But meanwhile, I saw NBC News, ABC and others say, this is why Obama needs the climate deal, because of this hurricane.
[02:16:30.237 --> 02:16:30.637]  Exactly.
[02:16:30.657 --> 02:16:35.098]  So every time, they basically said many bad things will happen with global warming.
[02:16:35.138 --> 02:16:48.161]  So now every time a bad thing happens, and I mean any time a bad thing, in fact the New York Times yesterday or this morning actually had an article about child marriage, forced child marriages are going to go up because of global warming.
[02:16:48.181 --> 02:16:50.921]  They actually said a, quote, surge in forced child marriages.
[02:16:50.981 --> 02:16:56.062]  Oh, they say war is going to cause, actually studies show war goes down during global warming because there's more food.
[02:16:56.122 --> 02:16:59.243]  The problem is cooling actually causes more war because there's less damn food.
[02:16:59.283 --> 02:16:59.643]  Excuse me.
[02:17:00.731 --> 02:17:07.453]  Yes, so essentially on hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, on every single measure, there's either declining or no trend in it.
[02:17:07.793 --> 02:17:12.335]  But the only way they can get these unprecedented is they want a new way to measure them.
[02:17:12.355 --> 02:17:20.937]  We already know they've altered past temperatures, they've cooled the 1930s, they've made to basically show warming trends that didn't previously exist.
[02:17:21.298 --> 02:17:24.839]  It's like a company losing money and you hire a new accountant, he re-does all the work.
[02:17:24.859 --> 02:17:28.380]  Sure, for those that don't know, we just put mainline headlines up, New York Times, you name it.
[02:17:29.366 --> 02:17:31.987]  They're now going to redefine hurricanes to make more of them.
[02:17:32.027 --> 02:17:33.448]  So, oh, they're record lows?
[02:17:33.748 --> 02:17:36.269]  We'll just say, because the Earth's cooling, you're going to have less of them.
[02:17:36.569 --> 02:17:38.170]  So now they'll just redefine them.
[02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:45.453]  And what they're going to do with that redefinition now, again, we have climate activists like Brad Johnson who call it fossil fuel poison weather.
[02:17:45.513 --> 02:17:46.654]  Every time there's a bad storm.
[02:17:47.134 --> 02:17:51.976]  They are now going, say New Jersey gets flooded by the remnants of a tropical storm or hurricane.
[02:17:52.337 --> 02:17:54.257]  They're now going to go after ExxonMobil.
[02:17:54.277 --> 02:17:57.559]  They're going to go after any other corporation, any energy source
[02:17:57.999 --> 02:18:03.582]  And the Attorney Generals are and say, you created this by your fossil fuel production.
[02:18:03.622 --> 02:18:06.263]  Therefore, you owe millions, billions.
[02:18:06.283 --> 02:18:09.805]  Sure, so it's a total shakedown and then General Electric and others will be exempt.
[02:18:09.825 --> 02:18:12.526]  So, Mark Moreno, let's get back to this because you're a stalwart guy.
[02:18:12.546 --> 02:18:13.986]  You're probably the number one, number two guy.
[02:18:14.006 --> 02:18:14.907]  It's either you or Moncton.
[02:18:15.367 --> 02:18:16.227]  Worldwide fighting.
[02:18:16.247 --> 02:18:17.228]  They should travel the planet.
[02:18:17.568 --> 02:18:18.288]  You've gone through hell.
[02:18:18.308 --> 02:18:20.449]  I'm not trying to lionize you, but you're a hero for all of us.
[02:18:20.749 --> 02:18:22.629]  This is the global government taxing mechanism.
[02:18:22.669 --> 02:18:23.750]  You're the champion.
[02:18:23.770 --> 02:18:32.532]  I read the news and they say people like Mark Moraine only to be looked at for indictment for racketeering because he's lying about this threat to humanity.
[02:18:32.552 --> 02:18:33.733]  I mean, this is so crazy.
[02:18:34.173 --> 02:18:37.974]  So speaking to that, where is this going with 15 attorney generals meeting in secret?
[02:18:37.994 --> 02:18:41.255]  We learned three months ago trying to figure out how to indict you and others.
[02:18:41.315 --> 02:18:43.376]  In fact, I've been told I'm now on the list as well.
[02:18:43.976 --> 02:18:49.317]  So hold on, are you saying that they're going to reclassify so a tropical storm would now be a hurricane?
[02:18:49.337 --> 02:18:49.537]  Yes.
[02:18:49.617 --> 02:18:50.818]  And they're just going to go all the way down?
[02:18:51.038 --> 02:18:54.039]  So what's going to be a tropical storm, like a flood or something?
[02:18:54.859 --> 02:18:55.579]  Yeah.
[02:18:55.679 --> 02:18:57.059]  This is ridiculous.
[02:18:57.600 --> 02:18:59.360]  You get it Joe, you need to pay money.
[02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:01.320]  But separately they want to arrest him.
[02:19:01.341 --> 02:19:02.481]  It's not talk now.
[02:19:02.741 --> 02:19:06.582]  This is the most ridiculous thing that these people can actually sit here and actually
[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:15.303]  Alter how we've been doing this, you know, scientifically, monitoring and classifying these hurricanes, and now they want to drop it down and go ahead and fit this agenda.
[02:19:15.323 --> 02:19:18.744]  I mean, that's just... Well, they're telling us they're going to redefine mother and father and marriage.
[02:19:18.804 --> 02:19:24.926]  It's all about... They're a cult of bean-counting pinheads that want to control reality.
[02:19:24.946 --> 02:19:28.687]  These people are the biggest control freaks because, listen, those that teach have never done.
[02:19:28.707 --> 02:19:32.608]  And I'm not bashing all teachers and professors, but they've never done anything.
[02:19:32.909 --> 02:19:36.230]  All they want to do is make us do stuff to build it the way they want.
[02:19:36.430 --> 02:19:36.950]  Mark Moreno.
[02:19:38.314 --> 02:19:46.560]  In the film Climate Hustle, Alex, you'll see Al Gore talk about there's too many, Africa is projected to have too many people, essentially.
[02:19:46.620 --> 02:19:50.823]  And he actually says we need to make fertility management ubiquitous.
[02:19:51.184 --> 02:19:53.686]  Now here we have a white, wealthy, Western politician.
[02:19:53.706 --> 02:19:54.926]  Let's get rid of black people.
[02:19:54.947 --> 02:19:56.247]  Oh, I know, exactly.
[02:19:56.588 --> 02:20:01.091]  You can't have cars, you can't have air conditioning, and we got to kill your babies, but it's okay because we're liberal.
[02:20:02.192 --> 02:20:03.273]  Specifically talk about that.
[02:20:03.333 --> 02:20:04.053]  Let me talk about that.
[02:20:04.233 --> 02:20:04.814]  This is incredible.
[02:20:06.314 --> 02:20:07.334]  Yes, and that's a huge one.
[02:20:07.374 --> 02:20:15.597]  The Sierra Club has come out with proposals to limit the one-child, essentially one-child-per-family policy, what many environmental groups are calling for.
[02:20:15.937 --> 02:20:22.820]  We have people going around college campuses preaching against having any children because the earth can't handle it.
[02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:28.482]  Jude Appenau, the big Hollywood producer, recently came out and did a probe over population control.
[02:20:28.862 --> 02:20:32.343]  Overpopulation is as big a part of global warming as a lot of the other
[02:20:32.483 --> 02:20:34.504]  That's their excuse to turn the energy off.
[02:20:34.564 --> 02:20:37.846]  When the truth is, if you just leave stuff alone, it's going to crest at $9 billion.
[02:20:38.066 --> 02:20:39.687]  If you don't then stabilize, things will collapse.
[02:20:39.727 --> 02:20:41.888]  You've got to have two kids to take care of two parents.
[02:20:42.268 --> 02:20:43.208]  All the actuaries are 100%.
[02:20:43.248 --> 02:20:45.229]  No one's denying that.
[02:20:45.289 --> 02:20:49.411]  So what's the larger agenda A, B, how is it going for them right now?
[02:20:49.452 --> 02:20:51.372]  Because it seems like we're winning the information war.
[02:20:51.413 --> 02:20:53.293]  Correct me if I'm wrong, but they just don't care.
[02:20:53.313 --> 02:20:54.214]  They're just moving forward.
[02:20:55.322 --> 02:20:56.002]  Here's the problem.
[02:20:56.742 --> 02:21:02.424]  Skeptics, we have absolutely not only won the information war, previously we've won the political battles.
[02:21:02.484 --> 02:21:02.664]  Again, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010.
[02:21:03.004 --> 02:21:05.685]  Every year climate bills came up before the United States Congress.
[02:21:05.705 --> 02:21:06.445]  They were defeated soundly.
[02:21:11.767 --> 02:21:12.448]  Switchboards!
[02:21:12.508 --> 02:21:14.730]  I worked on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
[02:21:15.051 --> 02:21:19.255]  Switchboards would come in overwhelmingly, 10 to 1, against climate bills.
[02:21:19.576 --> 02:21:20.256]  So what happened?
[02:21:20.597 --> 02:21:23.600]  President Obama said, I don't need no stinking Congress.
[02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:29.807]  He did, through executive order, he did what Congress would never have done because the people would never have allowed him.
[02:21:30.047 --> 02:21:32.750]  He passed, essentially, domestic climate legislation
[02:21:33.130 --> 02:21:40.513]  Through the EPA, he's declared what we exhale from our mouth, human breath, is now toxic, according to the United States federal government.
[02:21:40.553 --> 02:21:41.633]  Carbon dioxide.
[02:21:41.673 --> 02:21:43.754]  We inhale oxygen, we exhale carbon dioxide.
[02:21:44.074 --> 02:21:45.474]  We are now a pollutant.
[02:21:45.674 --> 02:21:50.696]  Human beings are breathing out a pollutant which is now regulated by the government.
[02:21:50.896 --> 02:21:52.337]  The public isn't even aware of this.
[02:21:52.637 --> 02:21:54.097]  The Congress had no vote on it.
[02:21:54.437 --> 02:21:59.419]  And good luck in the courts trying to get Obama and Clinton judges over to, frankly,
[02:21:59.619 --> 02:22:05.906]  I was about to say, because of the Supreme Court judgment, what, 10 years ago, saying that the EPA can operate on its own.
[02:22:07.147 --> 02:22:12.272]  They said that the EPA can actually determine whether carbon dioxide is a pollutant, which is all they needed to hear.
[02:22:12.312 --> 02:22:14.655]  So, now that that's a pollutant,
[02:22:15.482 --> 02:22:16.783]  Skeptics have lost that battle.
[02:22:16.803 --> 02:22:21.005]  We have domestic climate legislation without a single vote of Congress and without the public being aware.
[02:22:21.025 --> 02:22:23.467]  And I tell leftists, I go, China has no controls.
[02:22:23.607 --> 02:22:24.447]  All our jobs are moving there.
[02:22:24.467 --> 02:22:25.368]  They have dirty plants.
[02:22:26.028 --> 02:22:26.749]  Ours are clean.
[02:22:27.169 --> 02:22:29.190]  You understand that the energy there is three times cheaper.
[02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:30.251]  We'll never have a job.
[02:22:30.271 --> 02:22:31.671]  And they just go, shut up.
[02:22:31.791 --> 02:22:32.512]  I'm saving the earth.
[02:22:32.532 --> 02:22:34.393]  And I'm like, they've got dirty plants.
[02:22:34.593 --> 02:22:35.614]  Mexico has dirty plants.
[02:22:36.074 --> 02:22:37.375]  This just doesn't even make sense.
[02:22:39.124 --> 02:22:40.905]  I was just in Brussels last week.
[02:22:41.425 --> 02:22:54.791]  All of the European, what's left of European manufacturing, what's left of any semblance of European economic growth is literally being choked out by the central planners in Brussels and it's going everywhere else.
[02:22:55.371 --> 02:23:00.975]  I was about to say, clearly how the West was conquered by globalists was doing these trade deals, energy deals to shut us off.
[02:23:01.495 --> 02:23:05.858]  So, that's why we have Brexit, that's why Russia's pulling out of the New World Order, we're pulling out.
[02:23:05.918 --> 02:23:07.979]  I think that's what the whole Trump phenomenon is about.
[02:23:08.139 --> 02:23:12.722]  Mark Moreno, the new film, it's award winning, came out last December, now available on DVD.
[02:23:13.022 --> 02:23:15.183]  Climate Hustle at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:23:15.743 --> 02:23:21.227]  Such a powerful film, so key, very entertaining, very funny, way better than a Michael Moore film.
[02:23:21.787 --> 02:23:22.788]  Folks, get aggressive.
[02:23:22.888 --> 02:23:23.728]  Show it to your church.
[02:23:23.808 --> 02:23:24.689]  Show it to your Sunday school.
[02:23:25.049 --> 02:23:25.910]  Show it to your neighbors.
[02:23:26.730 --> 02:23:27.751]  This is an info war.
[02:23:27.811 --> 02:23:29.632]  People are now hungry for the truth.
[02:23:29.672 --> 02:23:34.956]  We're winning the info war, but we're not winning because, centrally, the controllers are still there.
[02:23:35.016 --> 02:23:36.777]  But we're at that tipping point.
[02:23:37.037 --> 02:23:39.739]  Get Climate Hustle, infowarestore.com.
[02:23:40.019 --> 02:23:41.720]  Get it at climatehustle.com from Mark Moreno.
[02:23:41.820 --> 02:23:42.261]  I don't care.
[02:23:42.321 --> 02:23:43.842]  Just get it and get it out.
[02:23:44.682 --> 02:23:47.184]  And jump at any time, Joe, because I got you here as you're hot on the subject.
[02:23:47.544 --> 02:23:50.006]  Mark Moreno, one of the chief fighters of this fraud worldwide,
[02:23:50.646 --> 02:23:53.987]  When I talk to actual liberals, most of them now admit this is a fraud.
[02:23:54.027 --> 02:23:56.707]  They just admit, though, this is their global government funding mechanism.
[02:23:57.027 --> 02:23:58.428]  So they just want a planned economy.
[02:23:58.768 --> 02:24:01.108]  They see themselves living in coffin apartments.
[02:24:01.448 --> 02:24:05.349]  They see themselves as, like, flagellating, beating themselves with whips.
[02:24:05.369 --> 02:24:06.770]  This is some type of austerity.
[02:24:07.090 --> 02:24:08.630]  It's a beautiful, pious thing to do.
[02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:12.291]  Well, it's only going to be a matter of time before people see that this is BS as well.
[02:24:12.591 --> 02:24:14.873]  You know, a lot of these people, those liberals, don't see that yet.
[02:24:15.133 --> 02:24:20.356]  But you're starting to see a Great Awakening happening on Twitter, on social media, especially with these Podesta emails coming out.
[02:24:20.676 --> 02:24:22.057]  Because people are starting to see that collusion.
[02:24:22.077 --> 02:24:26.020]  People are starting to see how the DNC, the Democrats, are lying about everything.
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:31.243]  And it's only going to be a matter of time before that rolls over onto where people start going, well, what else are they lying about?
[02:24:31.584 --> 02:24:33.005]  Well, what else have I been lied about, too?
[02:24:33.245 --> 02:24:37.788]  And eventually they're going to see this movie, or they're going to hear about it, and they're going to go, well, you know, maybe this entire time
[02:24:38.428 --> 02:24:43.292]  I did have a bunch of BS pumped into my head, and maybe the people on the right aren't so crazy.
[02:24:43.332 --> 02:24:45.133]  Maybe this is ridiculous.
[02:24:45.153 --> 02:24:45.894]  Sure, Mark.
[02:24:45.914 --> 02:24:46.574]  Great point, Mark.
[02:24:47.415 --> 02:24:48.416]  Yeah, Joe, absolutely.
[02:24:48.456 --> 02:24:59.925]  In fact, one of the things about Climate Hustle that we did, we interviewed a French socialist scientist, Dr. Claude Allegre, who originally screamed the alarm about global warming in the 1990s.
[02:25:00.085 --> 02:25:05.349]  He has now reversed himself as one of the leading skeptical scientists in Europe right now.
[02:25:05.829 --> 02:25:08.430]  We have Dr. Robert Giegengack, University of Pennsylvania.
[02:25:08.471 --> 02:25:18.896]  He voted for Al Gore, thinks he's a smart man, but he thinks that global warming is, they have it completely wrong, and he talks about the historic levels of CO2 and says CO2 is not the control knob.
[02:25:19.356 --> 02:25:24.399]  We interview Dr. Caleb Rossiter, a climate statistician from American University, an anti-
[02:25:24.919 --> 02:25:29.522]  Essentially an anti-war liberal Democrat, all the things that a Republican would say.
[02:25:29.542 --> 02:25:39.847]  He has now reversed himself on global warming and he talks about once he came out as a skeptic, all of his partners in the Democratic left, he was stripped of his role in organizations.
[02:25:40.087 --> 02:25:41.768]  He wouldn't let them publish his material.
[02:25:42.008 --> 02:25:44.870]  We interviewed other scientists, Dr. Dennis Rancourt, a man of the
[02:25:45.591 --> 02:25:51.400]  Let me ask you this, isn't it the persecution we're seeing is accelerating the resistance though?
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:54.525]  Because they thought people were just going along with this because of intimidation.
[02:25:54.846 --> 02:25:58.793]  Now that intimidation is actually open and naked, it seems like opposition is only forming more.
[02:26:00.248 --> 02:26:00.709]  Absolutely.
[02:26:00.749 --> 02:26:07.154]  In fact, the more and more opposition to these scientists speaking out, it has forced other scientists to come out.
[02:26:07.174 --> 02:26:08.395]  Well, you'll see that in the film.
[02:26:08.796 --> 02:26:10.037]  It actually has backfired.
[02:26:10.077 --> 02:26:18.845]  We actually feature Lord Monckton talking about how this anti-free speech and intimidation has backfired and forced other scientists, we interview a scientist,
[02:26:19.526 --> 02:26:29.575]  A statistician from Cornell who literally says the only reason he finally spoke out was because Al Gore and the United Nations chief were smearing skeptics and ridiculing and belittling them.
[02:26:29.815 --> 02:26:31.397]  So in that regard they're coming out.
[02:26:31.537 --> 02:26:34.100]  Unfortunately they all admit it hasn't helped their careers.
[02:26:34.580 --> 02:26:38.584]  We have the first woman PhD meteorologist, Dr. Joanne Simpson.
[02:26:38.984 --> 02:26:41.387]  Worked at NASA for 50 years.
[02:26:41.427 --> 02:26:42.848]  She's a practicing meteorologist.
[02:26:43.129 --> 02:26:45.331]  Didn't say a word about skepticism.
[02:26:45.571 --> 02:26:49.635]  She retires from NASA and says, now that I'm retired, I can say I'm a skeptic.
[02:26:50.157 --> 02:26:55.862]  That is how powerful the, I guess you'd call it, the narrative is for scientists.
[02:26:56.022 --> 02:27:00.005]  The first woman PhD scientist was beaten into silence until after she retired.
[02:27:00.025 --> 02:27:11.715]  Sure, well I'll tell you what's frustrating Mark, and you know all this because you've been on the committee in the Senate that has all the science, but just to basically put a gestalt out there, they know if you go back millions of years ago,
[02:27:12.921 --> 02:27:17.283]  I mean, CO2 was hundreds of times higher, now it's this tiny trace gas.
[02:27:17.303 --> 02:27:23.525]  A lot of evidence shows Mars had an atmosphere, lost its CO2, it collapsed, and the planet died.
[02:27:24.185 --> 02:27:29.787]  Okay, and that's what mainline science believes now Mars was, you know, we're probably from there, but the whole point is, is that
[02:27:30.709 --> 02:27:45.042]  Is that we know it's super low, we know it's all a lie, we know that it's not correlated to the temperature at the ways they're saying, so why the hell are they trying to do this if the planet's losing its atmosphere?
[02:27:46.343 --> 02:27:56.078]  Well, the very simple reason is that, in fact, the EU Climate Commission, again, I was in Brussels, has actually on record a few years ago as saying, even if we're wrong in the science, we're doing right by policy.
[02:27:56.098 --> 02:28:01.306]  In other words, they admit, the leaders of this admit, it's not about science, it's all about
[02:28:02.107 --> 02:28:06.551]  Essentially planning our economy and using whatever the latest environmental scare is.
[02:28:06.891 --> 02:28:09.933]  Amazon rainforest, overpopulation, and now global warming.
[02:28:10.233 --> 02:28:13.976]  And it's always, no matter what the scare is, the solution is always the same.
[02:28:14.136 --> 02:28:20.241]  More central planning, more command and control, and more... We've only got a minute and a half left, Mark Moreno.
[02:28:20.781 --> 02:28:22.883]  ClimateDepot.com is obviously your big news site.
[02:28:23.163 --> 02:28:25.465]  Climate Hustle, the new film, available at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:28:25.825 --> 02:28:26.505]  Folks, powerful.
[02:28:26.525 --> 02:28:27.206]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:28:29.922 --> 02:28:31.568]  Just a summation of one minute.
[02:28:31.649 --> 02:28:32.893]  Where is the fight right now?
[02:28:33.235 --> 02:28:34.901]  Clearly they want to tax the carbon cycle.
[02:28:35.082 --> 02:28:35.604]  Where is the fight?
[02:28:36.462 --> 02:28:38.844]  Well the biggest fight right now is this election.
[02:28:39.245 --> 02:28:52.098]  Donald Trump is the first Republican presidential nominee to declare himself a bold skeptic and can actually have a plan to defund the United Nations Climate Panel, to withdraw from the UN Treaty, and to overturn the executive orders.
[02:28:52.599 --> 02:28:54.641]  Donald Trump compared to George H.W.
[02:28:54.681 --> 02:28:59.546]  Bush, Bob Dole, George W. Bush, McCain, and Romney, there is no
[02:29:00.186 --> 02:29:04.288]  I don't understand how some conservatives say, oh, I can't vote for Trump because he's not a conservative.
[02:29:04.528 --> 02:29:09.651]  There has never been a Republican nominee that has ever staked out a position on climate like this, ever.
[02:29:09.771 --> 02:29:13.232]  Mitt Romney hung out and used Obama's advisors on climate.
[02:29:13.252 --> 02:29:15.153]  John McCain supported climate bills.
[02:29:15.373 --> 02:29:19.195]  George W. Bush rubber stamped and accepted every United Nations report.
[02:29:19.415 --> 02:29:20.416]  And George H.W.
[02:29:20.436 --> 02:29:21.756]  Bush got us into this mess.
[02:29:22.157 --> 02:29:25.658]  What Republican can you compare Donald Trump to unfavorably?
[02:29:25.718 --> 02:29:26.659]  It makes no sense.
[02:29:27.259 --> 02:29:31.041]  You have to go back to Reagan to find out maybe a president of equal to Donald Trump.
[02:29:31.081 --> 02:29:32.602]  And that's who he models himself after.
[02:29:32.722 --> 02:29:33.202]  Absolutely.
[02:29:33.262 --> 02:29:35.323]  If China doesn't have carbon taxes, we don't.
[02:29:35.964 --> 02:29:36.664]  Debate's over.
[02:29:36.704 --> 02:29:37.745]  We don't do it till you do it.
[02:29:37.785 --> 02:29:39.065]  Forget even debating whether it's good or not.
[02:29:39.085 --> 02:29:39.726]  We know it's a fraud.
[02:29:40.026 --> 02:29:41.347]  Till you do it, we don't do it.
[02:29:41.607 --> 02:29:43.788]  That's why the whole power structure we hate is against Trump.
[02:29:44.128 --> 02:29:45.169]  Trump or bust.
[02:29:45.509 --> 02:29:47.570]  Do you think there's going to be a landslide or will they try to steal it, Mark?
[02:29:48.704 --> 02:29:49.645]  That's a very good question.
[02:29:49.825 --> 02:29:52.047]  It's a question of how, it's the Brexit model.
[02:29:52.107 --> 02:29:54.590]  How many people the pollsters are missing are going to come out?
[02:29:54.970 --> 02:29:56.431]  It could be a squeaker, it's hard to say.
[02:29:56.511 --> 02:29:58.573]  All right, the film available at www.infowarstore.com.
[02:29:58.593 --> 02:29:59.214]  Great job, Mark.
[02:29:59.234 --> 02:30:02.117]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.037 --> 02:30:05.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.684 --> 02:30:12.346]  I'm going to lay it out short and sweet.
[02:30:14.133 --> 02:30:19.798]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[02:30:20.498 --> 02:30:24.482]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[02:30:25.362 --> 02:30:27.584]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[02:30:27.664 --> 02:30:28.825]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[02:30:29.506 --> 02:30:32.088]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[02:30:33.049 --> 02:30:33.409]  Or more.
[02:30:33.469 --> 02:30:35.371]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[02:30:35.911 --> 02:30:37.392]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[02:30:37.492 --> 02:30:40.835]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[02:30:40.935 --> 02:30:42.697]  It's actually scary.
[02:30:43.577 --> 02:30:53.666]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[02:30:54.667 --> 02:31:07.458]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support Infowars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[02:31:10.259 --> 02:31:12.180]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[02:31:12.220 --> 02:31:13.301]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:31:13.561 --> 02:31:14.482]  Why is this so good?
[02:31:14.762 --> 02:31:20.006]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:31:20.086 --> 02:31:33.636]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:31:33.696 --> 02:31:35.077]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:31:35.837 --> 02:31:37.439]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:31:37.499 --> 02:31:40.001]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:31:40.081 --> 02:31:41.343]  These are all parasites.
[02:31:41.383 --> 02:31:42.504]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:31:42.524 --> 02:31:43.545]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:31:43.845 --> 02:31:48.190]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:31:48.390 --> 02:31:51.573]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:31:51.613 --> 02:31:54.715]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:31:54.735 --> 02:31:55.756]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:31:55.796 --> 02:31:57.697]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:57.738 --> 02:31:58.758]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:31:58.778 --> 02:32:00.860]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:32:01.500 --> 02:32:04.523]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:04.783 --> 02:32:06.664]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:32:07.044 --> 02:32:09.006]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:32:10.250 --> 02:32:14.273]  Hey there, this is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com with a fun and exciting report by The Sun.
[02:32:14.333 --> 02:32:15.934]  He virtually rubbed my crotch.
[02:32:16.014 --> 02:32:18.656]  Woman sexually assaulted in virtual reality.
[02:32:18.736 --> 02:32:23.619]  The VR version was trying out the new technology for the first time with a game called Weaver.
[02:32:23.720 --> 02:32:28.483]  With a man using the pseudonym BigBro442 virtually groped her.
[02:32:28.643 --> 02:32:30.504]  We have decided not to name the woman.
[02:32:30.604 --> 02:32:35.205]  She wrote, In between a wave of zombies and demons to shoot down, I was hanging out next to Big Bro 442.
[02:32:35.725 --> 02:32:42.207]  Suddenly, Big Bro 442's disembodied helmet faced me dead on, and he started virtually rubbing my chest.
[02:32:42.327 --> 02:32:48.429]  The woman's first foray into virtual reality started off well as the experience won me over, lock, stock, and barrel.
[02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:53.211]  But just after three minutes in the virtual world, Big Bro 442 showed up and ruined everything.
[02:32:53.251 --> 02:32:53.891]  The woman cried,
[02:32:54.711 --> 02:32:55.332]  We're good to go.
[02:33:14.175 --> 02:33:19.518]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[02:33:21.039 --> 02:33:27.523]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[02:33:29.844 --> 02:33:32.526]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:36.072 --> 02:33:41.556]  We are now only 13 days out from this incredibly important historic general election.
[02:33:42.176 --> 02:33:43.617]  Joe Biggs is riding shotgun with me.
[02:33:43.637 --> 02:33:45.919]  Do we have Roger Stone on the line yet?
[02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:48.681]  Good, we're going to him in just a moment.
[02:33:49.281 --> 02:33:51.382]  We have a ton of other news we haven't gotten to yet.
[02:33:52.103 --> 02:33:57.386]  But clearly, as the new WikiLeaks show, they're over-sampling for Hillary.
[02:33:57.406 --> 02:33:58.447]  That's been the plan all along.
[02:33:59.408 --> 02:34:00.408]  What does that signify?
[02:34:01.499 --> 02:34:07.142]  When they add nine at the low end to 40 plus percent more Democrats in a sample.
[02:34:07.202 --> 02:34:09.323]  That shows massive landslide for Trump.
[02:34:09.684 --> 02:34:12.225]  But we don't want to make people overconfident where they don't go out and vote.
[02:34:13.286 --> 02:34:16.588]  Because evidence of vote flipping and machines going out in Texas.
[02:34:16.648 --> 02:34:18.309]  We're up on DrugsReport.com with all this.
[02:34:18.729 --> 02:34:19.569]  Joe Biggs is here with me.
[02:34:20.190 --> 02:34:22.031]  First off, I just talked about this film.
[02:34:23.234 --> 02:34:25.537]  It's now available on DVD here in the United States.
[02:34:26.158 --> 02:34:29.823]  It is Climate Hustle put up by Mark Moreno, Lord Monkton and others.
[02:34:30.844 --> 02:34:33.408]  And this is the heart of their takeover plan.
[02:34:33.488 --> 02:34:34.449]  People need to get this film.
[02:34:34.850 --> 02:34:36.572]  It also makes the transmission possible.
[02:34:36.993 --> 02:34:37.373]  We've got 25% off.
[02:34:39.412 --> 02:34:42.894]  On Brain Force, our top nootropic that everybody absolutely loves.
[02:34:43.895 --> 02:34:44.495]  $22, folks.
[02:34:44.555 --> 02:34:47.417]  Leading competitors have similar formulas at $50 to $60.
[02:34:48.817 --> 02:34:49.738]  So it's a great deal.
[02:34:49.798 --> 02:34:51.979]  Normally at, you know, $30 something.
[02:34:51.999 --> 02:34:55.902]  It's $22 right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:34:55.942 --> 02:34:58.803]  InfoWarsLife.com, again, is the supplement subsection.
[02:34:59.804 --> 02:35:05.467]  And a lot of other products that have been out of stock are now back, like Living Defense Parasite Cleanse.
[02:35:06.147 --> 02:35:06.828]  Now, continuing.
[02:35:08.114 --> 02:35:12.936]  We have other great sponsors outside of the products we sell, like United States Gold Vault, based right here in Texas.
[02:35:13.817 --> 02:35:16.698]  Will you and your family be protected when we have another economic meltdown?
[02:35:16.758 --> 02:35:20.020]  I believe an economic crash is coming, and you should protect yourself with real money.
[02:35:20.380 --> 02:35:22.301]  Do you want to be a victim, or do you want to be prepared?
[02:35:22.361 --> 02:35:25.202]  Take action with the company I trust, United States Gold Vault.
[02:35:25.282 --> 02:35:27.903]  Call today, 844-321-ALEX.
[02:35:28.284 --> 02:35:29.864]  That's 844-321-ALEX.
[02:35:30.204 --> 02:35:37.288]  They've created a game-changing gold and silver survival packs, and I've got one myself, filled with physical gold and silver coins that could help safeguard
[02:35:37.748 --> 02:35:40.651]  What you need most in a financial crisis, real money, not paper.
[02:35:42.273 --> 02:35:43.354]  Don't wait till it's too late.
[02:35:43.414 --> 02:35:45.396]  Call the United States Gold Vault now at 844-321-ALEX.
[02:35:45.436 --> 02:35:47.419]  They have a lot of other specials as well.
[02:35:47.979 --> 02:35:52.584]  And you'll get a rugged double locking bank bag to securely store your gold and silver absolutely free.
[02:35:52.604 --> 02:35:53.846]  United States Gold Vault.
[02:35:55.009 --> 02:35:57.332]  And then finally, Solutions from Science.
[02:35:57.412 --> 02:35:58.955]  I bought a generator from them 10 years ago.
[02:35:59.035 --> 02:36:00.336]  Obviously, they've upgraded it since then.
[02:36:00.817 --> 02:36:03.821]  I bought another one, I guess, last year of the latest design.
[02:36:04.622 --> 02:36:12.033]  And I got them as a sponsor because I was researching the best affordable, high-quality, low-cost systems that were expandable.
[02:36:13.100 --> 02:36:14.540]  And they've got one, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:14.820 --> 02:36:16.421]  Their perfect power solar generator.
[02:36:17.121 --> 02:36:18.081]  You can get it below cost.
[02:36:18.101 --> 02:36:20.361]  If you've never done a special like this, this is their top-of-the-line model.
[02:36:20.642 --> 02:36:21.582]  The one that I use at my house.
[02:36:21.622 --> 02:36:22.222]  It's expandable.
[02:36:22.882 --> 02:36:23.442]  Normally around $6,000.
[02:36:23.782 --> 02:36:26.163]  They're letting them go for around $1,500.
[02:36:26.683 --> 02:36:28.543]  Visit powergridchaos.com.
[02:36:28.563 --> 02:36:31.704]  That's powergridchaos.com and get yours before they're gone.
[02:36:31.724 --> 02:36:33.564]  They have a lot of other great products as well.
[02:36:33.864 --> 02:36:34.544]  They're on the site.
[02:36:36.145 --> 02:36:39.085]  And again, Infowars by Necessi.
[02:36:39.105 --> 02:36:42.026]  They say Necessi is the mother of invention.
[02:36:43.203 --> 02:36:45.024]  We are mainly fun about products we sell.
[02:36:45.044 --> 02:36:45.904]  We also have sponsors.
[02:36:45.944 --> 02:36:49.706]  We did that so we wouldn't be beholden to big corporations or the globalists.
[02:36:49.826 --> 02:36:50.826]  This is the future model.
[02:36:51.246 --> 02:36:56.348]  And it is you supporting the broadcast, spreading the word, but also buying the products that makes it all possible.
[02:36:56.368 --> 02:36:58.249]  So thank you all for your support.
[02:36:58.529 --> 02:36:59.409]  Joe Biggs is here with me.
[02:37:00.410 --> 02:37:03.211]  Obviously, he's a busy man, former head of the Trump campaign.
[02:37:04.266 --> 02:37:07.268]  Well Alex, I've got to be honest with you.
[02:37:24.159 --> 02:37:27.322]  Signs point to Hillary attempting to steal this election.
[02:37:27.482 --> 02:37:48.822]  When you look at the massive and enthusiastic turnout at Trump's public appearances, when you look at the paltry and uninspiring turnouts at her public appearances, when you add to that the new WikiLeaks information demonstrating a systematic inflating and manipulating of the polls to create
[02:37:49.788 --> 02:37:54.130]  Uh, an anticipation level, uh, for her support.
[02:37:54.831 --> 02:38:00.894]  Um, you know, I think that they will do anything necessary to hijack this election.
[02:38:01.714 --> 02:38:14.561]  I have long thought, and I've said here on InfoWars several times, that while I do think voter fraud is an issue, it is the machine manipulation that is more concerning to me because you see, that's the perfect crime.
[02:38:15.997 --> 02:38:24.722]  And that allows them to move hundreds and thousands of votes other than one or two here or there through the old-fashioned method of voter fraud.
[02:38:25.943 --> 02:38:41.813]  And it is, you know, it is why I'm hunkered down right now with an undisclosed location with a bunch of IT people and computer jockeys and other political scientists and at least two pollsters who are helping with us to put the finishing touches
[02:38:42.899 --> 02:38:49.085]  On the exit poll that we intend to conduct nationally for StopThisDeal.org.
[02:38:49.766 --> 02:38:52.108]  Alex, I know you've been very supportive of this effort.
[02:38:52.288 --> 02:38:53.969]  It is a non-profit effort.
[02:38:55.331 --> 02:38:57.373]  Everybody involved is a volunteer.
[02:38:57.853 --> 02:39:08.323]  And by the way, it's got the London Guardian, the New York Times implying you're involved in manipulating the election, but all you're doing is trying to push exit polls into the hallmark of our republic.
[02:39:10.464 --> 02:39:11.305]  Let's go through this.
[02:39:11.526 --> 02:39:15.191]  We are only interested in talking to voters after they have voted.
[02:39:15.211 --> 02:39:16.913]  This is not a poll-watching operation.
[02:39:17.454 --> 02:39:20.818]  The Trump campaign is doing a massive poll-watching operation.
[02:39:20.878 --> 02:39:21.900]  This is an exit poll.
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:25.505]  So how could we be intimidating voters after they vote?
[02:39:26.067 --> 02:39:30.031]  Secondarily, our targets are not selected on the basis of race.
[02:39:30.151 --> 02:39:30.932]  That is false.
[02:39:31.032 --> 02:39:31.973]  I've never said that.
[02:39:32.574 --> 02:39:34.876]  They're selected on the basis of one-party rule.
[02:39:35.337 --> 02:39:48.451]  We're going to go to the places where one party, the Democrats, control the state, the county, the city, and the local precinct, because that's where the abnormalities and irregularities will take place.
[02:39:49.311 --> 02:39:52.653]  And then of course there's the denigration of our volunteers.
[02:39:52.753 --> 02:39:55.175]  Roughnecks, thugs, hoodlums.
[02:39:55.235 --> 02:39:55.495]  No.
[02:39:55.895 --> 02:39:57.196]  They're volunteers.
[02:39:57.256 --> 02:39:59.737]  They're average Americans who support Donald Trump.
[02:39:59.757 --> 02:40:00.457]  It's funny you say that.
[02:40:00.477 --> 02:40:10.703]  This weekend I was monitoring NPR and they said Roger Stone's running a campaign to go into black communities and intimidate people with a bunch of, well, you know, rednecks.
[02:40:11.083 --> 02:40:11.924]  So they're really pissed.
[02:40:13.103 --> 02:40:15.064]  Yeah, it's not even close to true.
[02:40:15.104 --> 02:40:19.946]  I mean, some of these communities will be majority-minority, others will not.
[02:40:20.967 --> 02:40:24.688]  We're going to look at those precincts in Nevada, for example, in Clark County.
[02:40:24.728 --> 02:40:32.572]  Well, why are you not supposed to look at it, but the security force of the European Union is going to be here overseeing our elections?
[02:40:33.687 --> 02:40:35.848]  Yeah, look, it's an insult.
[02:40:36.228 --> 02:40:52.812]  And this is a massive undertaking, but to be very clear, we're talking about going into several thousand precincts in strategic states, strategic counties, and conducting, from the moment the polls open to the moment the polls close, a scientifically-based exit poll.
[02:40:53.372 --> 02:40:58.113]  We're not loading it for anyone, but let me be very clear on what the goal is, Alex.
[02:40:58.846 --> 02:41:14.073]  The international standard for elections, the standard used by our State Department, the standard used by Hillary Clinton herself, is that there can be no more than a 2% deviance between the actual results and exit polls conducted by the U.S.
[02:41:14.113 --> 02:41:14.493]  government.
[02:41:15.217 --> 02:41:18.462]  All we're asking for here is the exact same standard.
[02:41:18.642 --> 02:41:30.741]  If we conduct these polls and we find that everything is within that two-point margin, then we can conclude this was an honest election, fairly conducted, and has integrity.
[02:41:31.321 --> 02:41:40.931]  If we have widespread pattern of swings, 8, 9, 10, 12 percent, well then you'll have evidence that could be used in court to challenge this election.
[02:41:41.031 --> 02:41:42.993]  And that is our goal, to find out.
[02:41:43.433 --> 02:41:46.657]  I'm not making any preconceived prediction.
[02:41:46.757 --> 02:41:51.481]  Let's see what the actual... Sure, but I mean, plus... And jump in, Jones, you've got a lot of questions.
[02:41:52.628 --> 02:41:56.274]  You can't have the cake and eat it too and say Trump's trying to steal the election with the Russians.
[02:41:56.735 --> 02:41:57.536]  It's the worst ever.
[02:41:57.576 --> 02:41:59.860]  Homeland Security's got to take it over and get EU help.
[02:42:00.401 --> 02:42:01.002]  But meanwhile...
[02:42:02.110 --> 02:42:03.671]  There's no election fraud, everything's fine.
[02:42:04.252 --> 02:42:05.653]  Well, my buddy owns a call center.
[02:42:05.913 --> 02:42:08.715]  He's able to do all these political polling things.
[02:42:08.775 --> 02:42:13.439]  He can call 20,000 people, 200,000 people, and he does a very non-biased thing.
[02:42:13.479 --> 02:42:16.782]  He goes, alright, you know, press one, are you voting this election?
[02:42:16.802 --> 02:42:23.687]  I mean, to be clear, your friend runs a group call center that is contracted for polls, and tell folks what they're finding.
[02:42:24.208 --> 02:42:27.570]  Well, what they're finding is, overwhelmingly, they're doing these daily.
[02:42:29.132 --> 02:42:31.053]  65% for Trump almost every time.
[02:42:31.073 --> 02:42:32.974]  15 to 20% for Hillary.
[02:42:33.014 --> 02:42:35.836]  The rest is third party or undecided.
[02:42:36.216 --> 02:42:37.537]  And this is day in and day out.
[02:42:37.557 --> 02:42:46.923]  You know, when you look at ABC, CBS, NBC, all these polls they do, they contact 500, 250 people and they poll people who are largely Democrat.
[02:42:47.484 --> 02:42:48.444]  This is unbiased.
[02:42:48.484 --> 02:42:49.145]  We're not sure.
[02:42:49.225 --> 02:42:51.947]  I mean, they pull folks that call in and then say they want to be part of the poll.
[02:42:51.987 --> 02:42:57.250]  In fact, let's go ahead and can you guys queue up the short clip from last week of CNN?
[02:42:58.411 --> 02:43:02.074]  With the focus group, and 10 people are for Trump, 5 for Hillary, 6 undecided.
[02:43:02.334 --> 02:43:03.475]  That happens over and over again.
[02:43:03.495 --> 02:43:09.460]  So what I'm saying is, I see massive, massive, massive landslide for Trump in reality.
[02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:11.562]  I'm not just saying that, that's what I see.
[02:43:11.902 --> 02:43:15.485]  I mean, Kane has 30 people in Florida at his event.
[02:43:15.505 --> 02:43:17.466]  It's up on Infowars.com and DrugReport.com.
[02:43:17.967 --> 02:43:22.951]  So Roger, I mean, I know you want to be the pessimist just so we're safe here, but really, what's going on?
[02:43:24.023 --> 02:43:26.244]  I think that it's closer than that.
[02:43:26.304 --> 02:43:34.808]  I don't foresee a landslide because I do understand the Democrats' ability to get a number of these key constituency groups to the polls.
[02:43:34.848 --> 02:43:36.009]  And to vote 10 times apiece.
[02:43:37.409 --> 02:43:41.791]  And there is great prospect for both voter fraud and voter manipulation.
[02:43:41.831 --> 02:43:49.195]  That's why I'm putting 100% of my time between now and the election to being able to chart exactly what happens.
[02:43:49.355 --> 02:43:50.436]  So let me ask you this question.
[02:43:50.516 --> 02:43:54.439]  I mean, let's say we get a bunch of videos of people being driven around voting over and over again.
[02:43:54.479 --> 02:43:56.801]  We get evidence of vote flipping massively.
[02:43:56.861 --> 02:44:01.885]  You helped run, you know, the recount that took down Gore, obviously, and there was some evidence there on both sides.
[02:44:01.945 --> 02:44:04.087]  But, I mean, what do we do when they try to steal?
[02:44:04.127 --> 02:44:08.130]  They're obviously demonizing Trump, knowing he intends to fight for this, just like he did the nomination.
[02:44:09.102 --> 02:44:11.543]  Well, and that decision will be up to him.
[02:44:11.563 --> 02:44:25.905]  I am sick of the people attacking him, saying that he's tearing at the fabric of our democratic society, and he's undermining our democratic process because he refuses to endorse an election which hasn't happened yet, in which he can't see whether there's evidence of fraud.
[02:44:25.945 --> 02:44:29.166]  And which they're federalizing because they say that the Russians are taking over.
[02:44:29.926 --> 02:44:30.866]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[02:44:30.906 --> 02:44:34.567]  So in the one breath they tell you, this is ridiculous, these machines can't be hacked.
[02:44:35.067 --> 02:44:38.768]  And in the next breath they tell you, but they're concerned that the Russians are going to hack them.
[02:44:39.732 --> 02:44:50.057]  I met yesterday with a fellow who's an expert on the machine who assures me that they can be manipulated from the central server.
[02:44:50.138 --> 02:44:54.480]  Meaning, not the entity, the county entity that bought them or leased them.
[02:44:54.500 --> 02:44:56.081]  No, but the George Soros controlling 16%.
[02:44:56.121 --> 02:44:57.521]  He owns most of them.
[02:44:57.601 --> 02:44:58.282]  Exactly.
[02:44:58.542 --> 02:44:59.162]  Precisely.
[02:44:59.522 --> 02:45:00.063]  Precisely.
[02:45:00.783 --> 02:45:02.504]  Well, let's elaborate on that because
[02:45:04.178 --> 02:45:08.082]  That's really important, obviously, that Soros controls 60% of the voting in the country.
[02:45:08.122 --> 02:45:09.123]  He has connections to others.
[02:45:09.703 --> 02:45:12.346]  But separately, yeah, these computers phone home.
[02:45:12.706 --> 02:45:13.767]  They're hooked into the internet.
[02:45:14.328 --> 02:45:15.769]  Obviously, the companies have the back doors.
[02:45:15.809 --> 02:45:16.570]  They're controlling it.
[02:45:16.870 --> 02:45:20.413]  We already see power outages, computers turning off all over Texas.
[02:45:20.814 --> 02:45:21.795]  Our stories are on drudge.
[02:45:22.115 --> 02:45:22.755]  Vote flipping.
[02:45:23.056 --> 02:45:25.318]  It looks like they're already engaged in major hanky-panky.
[02:45:27.154 --> 02:45:33.982]  Every indication I've seen was that the blackouts we had on the Internet on the Eastern Seaboard last week came from inside the United States.
[02:45:34.863 --> 02:45:37.927]  The idea, this isn't yet another scare tactic.
[02:45:38.007 --> 02:45:40.150]  Oh, the Russians are closing down our Internet.
[02:45:40.731 --> 02:45:41.412]  I don't think so.
[02:45:42.233 --> 02:45:45.397]  And I reiterate again that all of these
[02:45:46.220 --> 02:45:47.920]  I mean, they blame it on the Russians but...
[02:46:16.167 --> 02:46:21.768]  They blame it on the Russians, but you have Podesta using a password that's P, at symbol, S-S-W-R-D.
[02:46:21.848 --> 02:46:24.529]  And it comes out he's on a payroll like his family.
[02:46:24.589 --> 02:46:28.910]  Anybody that's, you know, a 10-year-old or older can probably figure that out if they haven't.
[02:46:28.930 --> 02:46:30.371]  Well, it goes to the arrogance, I agree.
[02:46:31.011 --> 02:46:32.711]  Roger, other things that are on the radar.
[02:46:33.131 --> 02:46:34.432]  Where is Hillary weakest?
[02:46:34.672 --> 02:46:42.314]  A, B, do they have any sleeper, you know, BS folks that are getting ready to come out with new bull against Trump in the last 13 days?
[02:46:43.997 --> 02:47:00.753]  Uh, you never know what they may have up their sleeve, but I will say at this point, thanks to James O'Keefe and the excellent work done by Veritas and the drip, drip, drip of extraordinary information from WikiLeaks, Hillary and her ilk are on defense and they know it.
[02:47:00.833 --> 02:47:04.297]  That's why today's New York Times, or pardon me, yesterday's New York Times headline was
[02:47:05.018 --> 02:47:08.262]  Seeing victory ahead, you know, Hillary begins to plan.
[02:47:08.282 --> 02:47:10.063]  Seeing what victory ahead?
[02:47:10.183 --> 02:47:11.164]  Who wrote that headline?
[02:47:11.185 --> 02:47:12.045]  Carlos Slim?
[02:47:12.326 --> 02:47:13.807]  By the way, I saw that.
[02:47:14.067 --> 02:47:15.429]  That was in CNN.
[02:47:16.230 --> 02:47:18.312]  Roger, that was everywhere that she's planning.
[02:47:18.812 --> 02:47:19.453]  We played the clip.
[02:47:19.493 --> 02:47:20.814]  CNN, ABC, you name it.
[02:47:21.195 --> 02:47:23.577]  Yesterday, we're all saying, she's already won.
[02:47:23.777 --> 02:47:24.358]  Go to sleep.
[02:47:24.458 --> 02:47:24.899]  It's over.
[02:47:25.199 --> 02:47:26.941]  She's now planning to take over the White House.
[02:47:27.927 --> 02:47:34.272]  Again, trying to create an air of inevitability so that when they steal this, nobody will be the wiser.
[02:47:34.292 --> 02:47:37.314]  Are they going to move all the stuff they stole back in when they go in if they do?
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:40.820]  By the way, I want to just add something here.
[02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:43.502]  We're selling, at cost, a whistle designed by Roger Stone.
[02:47:43.542 --> 02:47:44.782]  It says, Clinton Rape Whistle.
[02:47:45.223 --> 02:47:46.383]  Infowars.com.
[02:47:46.723 --> 02:47:48.945]  We're selling these at cost, along with the Hello4Prison shirt.
[02:47:49.445 --> 02:47:51.326]  And you need to order this today, folks.
[02:47:51.806 --> 02:47:56.109]  And then go out to any of their rallies, their surrogates rallies, and blow the rape whistle.
[02:47:56.149 --> 02:48:04.873]  When the press comes over and asks why you're doing it, you're exposing people that have physically raped folks, covered up rapes, and are raping the country for the Communist Chinese, the Russians, and others.
[02:48:05.133 --> 02:48:05.854]  So it's time to
[02:48:07.776 --> 02:48:13.901]  Blow the whistle with the Infowars Bill Clinton Ripe Whistle and the Bill Clinton Ripe Shirt at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:48:14.181 --> 02:48:14.441]  Roger?
[02:48:15.222 --> 02:48:24.850]  Yes, and we will be publishing Bill's campaign schedule and we ask patriots, get your whistle at Infowars, get your t-shirt, and go to his rallies and peacefully protest.
[02:48:24.930 --> 02:48:27.652]  It's unfortunate that we have to use these guerrilla tactics.
[02:48:28.313 --> 02:48:32.902]  Break through the mainstream media blackout of Bill's record as a sexual predator.
[02:48:32.922 --> 02:48:36.088]  But they've shut down the press, they've sent people to shut down Trump events.
[02:48:36.328 --> 02:48:38.012]  We're not trying to shut stuff down, let's be clear.
[02:48:38.272 --> 02:48:39.434]  We're just going to get free speech out.
[02:48:40.516 --> 02:48:51.058]  And as you have said repeatedly, if you can get on television with this suit, with this shirt, legally, legally, you know, it breaks through the mainstream media blackout, because that's what we have.
[02:48:51.578 --> 02:48:55.899]  If the mainstream media was covering this issue, we wouldn't have to resort to these tactics.
[02:48:55.979 --> 02:49:04.581]  But they leave us no choice, and until Bill is greeted with 200 whistlers at some future campaign stop, I'm not going to be happy.
[02:49:05.205 --> 02:49:08.087]  And folks, if you don't get the whistle from us, just go with the whistle.
[02:49:08.507 --> 02:49:09.588]  It gets a lot of attention.
[02:49:09.648 --> 02:49:10.509]  It's a great idea.
[02:49:10.529 --> 02:49:12.530]  Now, Roger, I've been asking some of the questions here.
[02:49:13.051 --> 02:49:16.073]  Clearly, they're trying to steal it.
[02:49:16.273 --> 02:49:18.175]  If they try to announce it, how do we fight it?
[02:49:18.215 --> 02:49:18.895]  You were there in 2000.
[02:49:18.995 --> 02:49:20.836]  I mean, what's the process?
[02:49:20.856 --> 02:49:22.157]  Because now we don't have Scalia.
[02:49:22.197 --> 02:49:22.958]  He's out of the way.
[02:49:23.078 --> 02:49:23.438]  It's 4-4.
[02:49:23.478 --> 02:49:25.340]  So we've got a split decision.
[02:49:26.403 --> 02:49:28.344]  Well, speed will be the most important thing.
[02:49:28.384 --> 02:49:39.772]  In other words, we're going to have to assess the situation immediately, within hours of the election being over, and make a presentation to Donald Trump as to exactly what we have found.
[02:49:40.272 --> 02:49:49.498]  We will have sworn affidavits from each of the volunteers, but Alex, really what we need right now, more than anything else,
[02:49:50.414 --> 02:49:57.677]  People can go to StopTheSteal.org and sign up to work on Election Day conducting exit polls with us.
[02:49:58.157 --> 02:50:06.661]  We will train you, we will assign you, we will help you through the process, but we need good men and good women, patriots, who will donate their time.
[02:50:07.141 --> 02:50:12.783]  We need an army of InfoWar warriors to help us with this project.
[02:50:12.803 --> 02:50:14.584]  13 days!
[02:50:15.845 --> 02:50:18.826]  We have the blood, sweat, and toil of the American people.
[02:50:19.726 --> 02:50:20.947]  13 days, 10 hours, Roger.
[02:50:22.567 --> 02:50:23.247]  Don't we know it?
[02:50:23.287 --> 02:50:27.168]  The computer jockeys are driving me crazy for the final target.
[02:50:27.348 --> 02:50:36.691]  We are putting a fine point on this and we will unveil the app shortly for people to get assigned and get trained.
[02:50:38.052 --> 02:50:39.292]  Very, very exciting.
[02:50:39.312 --> 02:50:41.713]  When we come back, what else is front and center for you?
[02:50:43.484 --> 02:50:51.048]  Well, look, I am, uh, I just continue to be amazed at the quality and extraordinary nature of the information coming out of WikiLeaks.
[02:50:51.088 --> 02:50:54.229]  But even more amazing is the media's attempts to ignore it.
[02:50:56.350 --> 02:50:57.631]  It really is unprecedented.
[02:50:57.671 --> 02:50:58.572]  I mean, I'm ashamed.
[02:50:58.632 --> 02:51:03.514]  I mean, Hillary should be locked up five years ago, ten years ago, twenty, much less.
[02:51:03.594 --> 02:51:08.336]  Now it's just all crime after crime, covering it up, lying.
[02:51:08.356 --> 02:51:09.157]  I mean, we have them.
[02:51:18.382 --> 02:51:30.144]  It's great to be here with a thousand wonderful people, or as I call it, a small, intimate dinner with some friends.
[02:51:30.204 --> 02:51:35.045]  Or as Hillary calls it, her largest crowd of the season.
[02:51:36.505 --> 02:51:46.347]  And even tonight, with all of the heated back and forth between my opponent and me at the debate last night,
[02:51:48.035 --> 02:51:52.801]  We have proven that we can actually be civil to each other.
[02:51:53.562 --> 02:52:04.737]  In fact, just before taking the day, Hillary accidentally bumped into me and she very civilly said, pardon me.
[02:52:11.778 --> 02:52:18.924]  And I very politely replied, let me talk to you about that after I get into office.
[02:52:19.564 --> 02:52:36.578]  But one of the things I noticed tonight, and I've known Hillary for a long time, this is the first time ever, ever, that Hillary is sitting down and speaking to major corporate leaders and not getting paid for it.
[02:52:39.741 --> 02:52:40.682]  You know, last night,
[02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.422]  I called Hillary a nasty woman.
[02:52:47.024 --> 02:52:48.345]  But this stuff is all relative.
[02:52:49.766 --> 02:53:01.035]  After listening to Hillary rattle on and on and on, I don't think so badly of Rosie O'Donnell anymore.
[02:53:02.536 --> 02:53:07.840]  In fact, I'm actually starting to like Rosie a lot.
[02:53:09.061 --> 02:53:11.603]  You know, the president told me to stop whining.
[02:53:13.223 --> 02:53:21.770]  But I really have to say, the media is even more biased this year than ever before.
[02:53:21.810 --> 02:53:22.570]  You want the proof?
[02:53:23.571 --> 02:53:30.016]  Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it.
[02:53:30.076 --> 02:53:30.797]  It's fantastic.
[02:53:31.857 --> 02:53:33.899]  They think she's absolutely great.
[02:53:35.260 --> 02:53:40.044]  My wife Melania gives the exact same speech.
[02:53:43.217 --> 02:53:45.979]  And people get on her case!
[02:53:49.001 --> 02:53:54.584]  I wasn't really sure if Hillary was going to be here tonight.
[02:53:54.904 --> 02:54:01.108]  Because I guess you didn't send her invitation by email.
[02:54:02.189 --> 02:54:08.493]  Or maybe you did, and she just found out about it through the wonder of WikiLeaks.
[02:54:10.175 --> 02:54:12.337]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:54:12.918 --> 02:54:15.781]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:21.647 --> 02:54:25.331]  I forget who it was that said I wouldn't be part of any club that would have me as a member.
[02:54:27.057 --> 02:54:33.621]  But, watching that roast, that Catholic roast, those people, oh, I'm sorry, except for the one woman in the back, look really creepy.
[02:54:33.701 --> 02:54:36.703]  I mean, like, central casting of, like, Body Snatchers or something.
[02:54:36.723 --> 02:54:44.247]  They're all sweating, and look like demons, and wearing little festooned amulets around their neck while they sit there worshipping Hillary Clinton.
[02:54:45.668 --> 02:54:48.670]  Groucho Marx, who said it, I just know this.
[02:54:50.063 --> 02:54:52.685]  Whether Trump wins or loses, clearly he's way ahead.
[02:54:53.226 --> 02:54:55.188]  Clearly she doesn't have any crowds, he doesn't either.
[02:54:55.208 --> 02:54:59.392]  I mean, he gets 30 people, her VP candidate.
[02:54:59.492 --> 02:55:01.093]  The photos are up on Infowars.com right now.
[02:55:03.490 --> 02:55:05.050]  We win by taking action.
[02:55:05.090 --> 02:55:07.251]  I'm not just saying that to make everybody feel good in case they steal it.
[02:55:07.891 --> 02:55:09.152]  We have exposed globalism.
[02:55:09.212 --> 02:55:10.392]  World government's in trouble.
[02:55:11.092 --> 02:55:15.333]  Major issues of Americanism, not globalism, and all these one-sided trade deals are now front and center.
[02:55:15.833 --> 02:55:23.296]  And the movement that we've started and you've started and Ron Paul pushed and that we see with the exploding with Trump is just beginning.
[02:55:23.356 --> 02:55:31.138]  This is just absolutely a meteoric rise of nationalistic constitutional free market awakening.
[02:55:31.318 --> 02:55:31.798]  Roger Stone?
[02:55:33.398 --> 02:55:34.919]  Look Alex, I totally agree.
[02:55:35.100 --> 02:55:44.667]  I'm really getting fed up with this idea that if you are not for war with the Russians, you are a traitor to the United States, you are a Russian agent.
[02:55:45.107 --> 02:55:58.838]  I was on The Circus, the Showtime show on Sunday, heavily edited by the way, and yet again confronted with this whole idea that I either knew in advance who Assange was going to
[02:56:00.320 --> 02:56:01.523]  I don't think so.
[02:56:10.703 --> 02:56:14.786]  And then on Sunday, I did a CBS interview out of Miami.
[02:56:15.366 --> 02:56:27.533]  They played a clip of Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland saying flatly that I knew in advance of the hacking of John Podesta.
[02:56:28.014 --> 02:56:31.576]  Consequently, my attorneys are in the process of contacting him.
[02:56:31.596 --> 02:56:33.537]  We're going to give him an opportunity to retract.
[02:56:34.153 --> 02:56:38.818]  But if he does not, he has made this statement flatly off the floor of the U.S.
[02:56:38.838 --> 02:56:45.606]  House, so he does not enjoy congressional immunity, and he leaves me no choice but to sue him, because it's a falsehood.
[02:56:45.786 --> 02:56:49.270]  It's a lie, and it needs to be put to bed right now.
[02:56:49.775 --> 02:56:52.756]  Well, Roger, I've had them call me a Russian agent, and it really pisses me off.
[02:56:52.916 --> 02:56:58.159]  I mean, these globalists are the ones selling us out to all these foreign interests, and it's just crazy.
[02:56:58.759 --> 02:57:08.583]  WikiLeaks specifically, and you jump in too, Biggs, I mean, just the bombshells, the latest ones that came out in today's dump, where they're saying, we've got to cover up for Hillary, that she was secretly talking to Obama.
[02:57:08.903 --> 02:57:09.804]  He's been caught in a lie.
[02:57:09.824 --> 02:57:10.604]  This is so big.
[02:57:14.085 --> 02:57:15.186]  Where do you think this goes, Roger?
[02:57:16.702 --> 02:57:25.804]  Well, it kind of depends on whether the mainstream media is going to finally bow to the newsworthy nature of these disclosures.
[02:57:25.864 --> 02:57:29.885]  I mean, NBC in particular, they act as if none of it's happening.
[02:57:29.925 --> 02:57:31.566]  It just isn't even happening.
[02:57:31.646 --> 02:57:36.227]  It appears that Hannity is about the only one that actually even covers any of this whatsoever.
[02:57:37.381 --> 02:57:47.026]  Let's remember that only weeks ago, people were attacking both Alex and I because it became clear that Wikileaks wasn't going to release anything that was newsworthy.
[02:57:47.046 --> 02:57:49.888]  And the left was celebrating and high-fiving each other.
[02:57:50.388 --> 02:57:52.149]  Now we know that that was wrong.
[02:57:52.689 --> 02:57:55.872]  So, again, I think that we have to see.
[02:57:56.292 --> 02:58:04.899]  I'm going to focus on the narrow piece of ground that I care about, which is ensuring that we can determine whether or not this was a fair election.
[02:58:05.100 --> 02:58:09.984]  And if it is not... Sure, and you do it with exit polls because they really want to steal the machines.
[02:58:10.799 --> 02:58:12.860]  That's exactly where I think it will be.
[02:58:12.880 --> 02:58:21.505]  The Trump campaign is focused on the question of voter fraud, the other part of this, and certainly a legitimate part of it at that.
[02:58:21.685 --> 02:58:23.246]  So I think we have the ground covered.
[02:58:23.726 --> 02:58:28.509]  Again, I implore good men and good women who have the time and have the motivation.
[02:58:29.089 --> 02:58:33.912]  Patriots, please go to StopTheSteal.org and sign up to help us on Election Day.
[02:58:35.029 --> 02:58:35.669]  Absolutely.
[02:58:35.830 --> 02:58:36.190]  All right.
[02:58:36.290 --> 02:58:39.932]  Everybody making your reports ends up National News, like right here in Texas today.
[02:58:39.952 --> 02:58:42.113]  That's up on DrugsReport.com and other sites.
[02:58:42.173 --> 02:58:43.234]  Thank you so much, Roger Stone.
[02:58:43.274 --> 02:58:43.794]  Talk to you soon.
[02:58:44.414 --> 02:58:45.035]  Great to be here.
[02:58:45.095 --> 02:58:45.335]  Thanks.
[02:58:45.615 --> 02:58:47.156]  Fourth Hour with Paul Watson straight ahead.
[02:58:47.196 --> 02:58:48.797]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:48.817 --> 02:58:51.678]  If your station doesn't carry it, we're going to continue on with Paul Watson.
[02:58:51.698 --> 02:58:53.359]  We got more to say here with Joe Biggs.
[02:58:53.699 --> 02:58:54.280]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:59.944 --> 02:59:04.306]  Get Brain Force at 25% off for a limited time at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:04.446 --> 02:59:06.627]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:59:06.747 --> 02:59:13.569]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:59:13.769 --> 02:59:17.051]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[02:59:17.071 --> 02:59:18.231]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[02:59:18.531 --> 02:59:20.372]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[02:59:20.712 --> 02:59:25.995]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do, this is sustainable.
[02:59:26.095 --> 02:59:30.097]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[02:59:30.297 --> 02:59:33.479]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:59:33.539 --> 02:59:36.561]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:59:36.681 --> 02:59:37.982]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:19.901 --> 03:00:20.621]  We're on the march.
[03:00:21.322 --> 03:00:22.662]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:00:24.683 --> 03:00:26.043]  We are on the march.
[03:00:26.484 --> 03:00:28.865]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:00:29.625 --> 03:00:33.426]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:33.806 --> 03:00:34.647]  Thirteen days!
[03:00:34.947 --> 03:00:40.049]  Paul Watson takes over the next segment from Her Britannic Majesty's London, England.
[03:00:40.889 --> 03:00:42.530]  Joe Biggs is here riding shotgun with me.
[03:00:44.375 --> 03:00:48.359]  I haven't even gotten to Michael Moore saying, you know, if you elect Trump, he'll be the biggest F you of the establishment ever.
[03:00:48.379 --> 03:00:50.601]  Well then, why don't you go against the establishment?
[03:00:50.621 --> 03:00:52.383]  This is so obvious, Michael Moore, but you can't.
[03:00:52.803 --> 03:00:55.125]  You have six bodyguards, but I shouldn't be able to own a gun.
[03:00:56.006 --> 03:00:58.088]  I was asking you during the break, do you think it's a landslide for Trump?
[03:00:58.108 --> 03:01:00.430]  You said some really choice points that I agree with.
[03:01:00.971 --> 03:01:01.771]  Repeat those, Joe Beggs.
[03:01:01.791 --> 03:01:03.673]  Well, I think he's going to win by a landslide.
[03:01:04.714 --> 03:01:07.537]  But the thing is, like you said, it's those machines you have to worry about.
[03:01:07.898 --> 03:01:11.582]  You know, people do have the ability, I believe, in a lot of areas to request a paper ballot as well.
[03:01:12.023 --> 03:01:13.785]  If you're able to do that, try that out as well.
[03:01:13.845 --> 03:01:21.233]  But if you look at the Trump rally yesterday in Tampa, Florida, versus the Kaine or the Clinton rallies, he has 20,000, 20,000 turned away, he has 30.
[03:01:24.076 --> 03:01:26.197]  But not just 20,000 people, Alex.
[03:01:26.217 --> 03:01:31.979]  20,000 energized, patriotic, just hopped up on True Freedom.
[03:01:31.999 --> 03:01:33.040]  Of every race, color, and creed.
[03:01:33.060 --> 03:01:34.260]  Yes, everybody.
[03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:37.461]  Gay, straight, Catholic, Muslim, it doesn't matter.
[03:01:37.741 --> 03:01:42.843]  There are people from all over the world that travel to go see this man because he's an amazing individual.
[03:01:43.164 --> 03:01:43.964]  But you have to, like,
[03:01:44.404 --> 03:01:48.828]  You have to pry and pull energy from people who go to these Cain and Clinton rallies.
[03:01:48.848 --> 03:01:50.249]  Hillary's like this zombie.
[03:01:50.309 --> 03:01:59.837]  I mean, let's put the article up from the Gateway Pundit that shows the videos and the photos for TV viewers and radio listeners should go to Infowars.com and CedarDredgeReport has it, DredgeReport.com.
[03:02:00.198 --> 03:02:01.058]  I mean, it's right there.
[03:02:01.539 --> 03:02:01.859]  Wow.
[03:02:01.979 --> 03:02:05.162]  Cain holds rally and only 30 people show up and it's over and over again.
[03:02:05.182 --> 03:02:05.622]  It's like this.
[03:02:05.642 --> 03:02:06.183]  You scroll down.
[03:02:06.743 --> 03:02:07.684]  This isn't out of context.
[03:02:07.724 --> 03:02:08.885]  This is while he's speaking.
[03:02:08.985 --> 03:02:09.586]  It's 30 people.
[03:02:10.046 --> 03:02:12.348]  I mean, yeah, I'm sure there's going to be people who don't go to these things.
[03:02:12.408 --> 03:02:13.289]  But here's the thing, though.
[03:02:13.649 --> 03:02:17.333]  You can see in mass numbers how many people who love Trump, they're coming out.
[03:02:17.833 --> 03:02:19.535]  They're coming... The Googlebot show.
[03:02:19.575 --> 03:02:20.936]  From 10 to 1 interest.
[03:02:21.637 --> 03:02:23.899]  The major corporations admit landslide for Trump.
[03:02:23.979 --> 03:02:25.360]  All the internet bots know.
[03:02:25.780 --> 03:02:28.981]  You've got from 13 to 90, you know, age groups.
[03:02:29.041 --> 03:02:30.241]  People are so excited.
[03:02:30.301 --> 03:02:32.302]  I saw a guy who was so old.
[03:02:32.362 --> 03:02:38.724]  He was out there on one of those walkers and he got there late and they had reached, you know, the capacity for that stadium.
[03:02:39.164 --> 03:02:40.944]  And he goes, man, I just wanted to hear him.
[03:02:40.984 --> 03:02:44.105]  So I helped him walk up to the front of the door and he could still see it in here.
[03:02:44.125 --> 03:02:47.446]  And he was so excited because he knows this is going to change everything.
[03:02:47.466 --> 03:02:48.266]  Well, that's very touching.
[03:02:48.286 --> 03:02:50.087]  I hope you get video of that kind of stuff because it's amazing.
[03:02:50.107 --> 03:02:50.987]  I know that stuff's going on.
[03:02:51.747 --> 03:02:53.228]  What happens if they openly steal it?
[03:02:53.268 --> 03:02:54.288]  I mean, they're really arrogant.
[03:02:54.308 --> 03:02:55.349]  They're full of bravado.
[03:02:55.389 --> 03:02:55.829]  What happens?
[03:02:56.610 --> 03:02:58.731]  You know, I think you're going to see a lot of this.
[03:02:58.791 --> 03:02:59.911]  It's going to have to be forced.
[03:02:59.931 --> 03:03:03.313]  It's going to be covered because you're going to see people extremely mad.
[03:03:03.593 --> 03:03:06.094]  You're going to see social media going off the charts about this.
[03:03:06.574 --> 03:03:07.995]  This has been stolen.
[03:03:08.035 --> 03:03:14.418]  I'm concerned they could pull a false flag, like steal it from Trump and then to demonize us, you know, blow up a government building or something and blame it on us.
[03:03:14.478 --> 03:03:14.858]  I'm telling you.
[03:03:15.159 --> 03:03:15.319]  Yeah.
[03:03:15.999 --> 03:03:16.600]  It's possible.
[03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:21.003]  You know, I don't think there's any fair way that she has a chance of winning.
[03:03:21.303 --> 03:03:24.506]  When you go look at her events, there's no one outside that's excited to be there.
[03:03:24.866 --> 03:03:26.648]  You know, they look like the Walking Dead.
[03:03:27.128 --> 03:03:31.772]  It's the most depressing... I don't mean to be mean, but I mean, Hillary supporters look like...
[03:03:32.372 --> 03:03:33.472]  They've been run over by cars.
[03:03:33.732 --> 03:03:35.233]  I mean, they look mentally retarded.
[03:03:35.473 --> 03:03:36.533]  I mean, I'm not being mean here.
[03:03:36.553 --> 03:03:37.493]  I mean, what the hell happened?
[03:03:37.653 --> 03:03:38.093]  I'll say it.
[03:03:38.133 --> 03:03:38.774]  I think they are.
[03:03:39.094 --> 03:03:41.774]  I mean, we're not just saying that, though.
[03:03:41.794 --> 03:03:46.815]  You go to a Trump rally, I don't care if they're black, Hispanic, white, good looking, focused, well spoken, hard working people.
[03:03:47.195 --> 03:03:51.156]  You go to a Hillary's thing and they look like they're walking dead, man.
[03:03:51.176 --> 03:03:52.257]  I mean, there's something wrong with them.
[03:03:52.277 --> 03:03:56.298]  When you go to Trump rallies, these are all small business owners, people who are not lazy.
[03:03:56.338 --> 03:03:57.478]  People are going out there and
[03:03:58.098 --> 03:04:06.449]  Making a business for themselves, creating something, and giving people jobs, and helping people out, and helping out the economy, and making something for themselves.
[03:04:06.769 --> 03:04:08.151]  And that's what the American Dream's all about.
[03:04:08.191 --> 03:04:11.094]  Yeah, but ignore the crowd of 20,000 that turned away 20,000 in Tampa.
[03:04:12.216 --> 03:04:14.158]  Hillary gets 200, King gets 30.
[03:04:14.238 --> 03:04:15.079]  They're the winner, dude.
[03:04:16.150 --> 03:04:17.732]  If Trump... Michael Moore said so.
[03:04:17.792 --> 03:04:22.576]  If emails came out exposing half the stuff that Hillary's done, I mean, it'd be done.
[03:04:23.177 --> 03:04:29.583]  You know, and you've got Assange going, well, I mean, we've seen some emails, but it's just the same stuff that he says already, because he's honest.
[03:04:30.144 --> 03:04:31.025]  He's not two-faced.
[03:04:31.065 --> 03:04:31.845]  He's not a chameleon.
[03:04:32.126 --> 03:04:37.331]  He doesn't go on TV and act a certain way and then go back and then talk crack about the American people.
[03:04:37.351 --> 03:04:37.611]  That's right.
[03:04:37.651 --> 03:04:38.852]  Everybody's hacked Trump's stuff.
[03:04:38.872 --> 03:04:39.413]  There's nothing there.
[03:04:39.873 --> 03:04:41.354]  It's just like, dude, he's saying the same thing.
[03:04:41.374 --> 03:04:45.395]  Like, everything you're reading here in this about Trump is the exact same thing he's already said in his speech.
[03:04:45.435 --> 03:04:46.616]  So there's nothing we can do.
[03:04:46.656 --> 03:04:50.597]  But when you read this stuff, you've got Hillary Clinton going out there going, oh, I love the American people.
[03:04:50.817 --> 03:04:51.757]  But then you read the emails.
[03:04:51.777 --> 03:04:52.238]  She hates them.
[03:04:52.298 --> 03:04:53.518]  She hates everyday Americans.
[03:04:53.738 --> 03:04:54.619]  You're a super predator.
[03:04:54.839 --> 03:04:55.599]  You're deplorable.
[03:04:55.699 --> 03:04:56.419]  You're this, you're that.
[03:04:57.099 --> 03:04:58.560]  She's a monster, and that's why they hate him.
[03:04:58.860 --> 03:05:00.361]  He doesn't follow polls.
[03:05:00.381 --> 03:05:01.521]  He doesn't follow the directives.
[03:05:01.821 --> 03:05:05.543]  Michael Moore said the best thing is that this is going to be the biggest F you to the establishment.
[03:05:05.563 --> 03:05:06.463]  The elites are scared.
[03:05:06.503 --> 03:05:08.904]  I'm going to play that and the baton that Paul wants when we come back.
[03:05:10.542 --> 03:05:22.327]  With Mrs. Clinton, if... You know, I got the... What I used to say when I could talk, when I couldn't talk, is that, you know, no matter where we went, she'd come in, she'd be grateful, say thanks.
[03:05:22.648 --> 03:05:26.329]  Thank you to the back of the house, people in the kitchen, etc.
[03:05:26.889 --> 03:05:28.970]  But that was always if there was press around.
[03:05:29.851 --> 03:05:32.712]  She's a completely different person when the camera's not on her.
[03:05:33.909 --> 03:05:35.050]  And I ran into an incident.
[03:05:35.110 --> 03:05:44.736]  I was at the Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center in Washington, D.C., and we were doing a tea with Mrs. Chirac, the former French president's wife.
[03:05:46.097 --> 03:05:57.624]  And it was just Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Chirac, and myself in the same room, and one of the people brought in something, and it did not please her, and she used the N-word very openly.
[03:05:58.339 --> 03:06:00.120]  Not just gangs of kids anymore.
[03:06:00.480 --> 03:06:03.963]  They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators.
[03:06:04.283 --> 03:06:05.984]  No conscience, no empathy.
[03:06:06.284 --> 03:06:10.127]  We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.
[03:06:10.427 --> 03:06:17.811]  Again, former top chef to the Clintons, Mr. Martin, can you walk through specifically what was happening in the conversation, what was said?
[03:06:18.932 --> 03:06:21.634]  Well, what had happened with the conversation is,
[03:06:22.549 --> 03:06:26.992]  I was just, like I said, Mrs. Chirac, Mrs. Clinton, and myself in there.
[03:06:27.072 --> 03:06:28.373]  I was just serving them tea.
[03:06:29.213 --> 03:06:34.576]  We had somebody bring in something, I think it was like some tea sandwiches or whatever, and it wasn't exactly what she wanted.
[03:06:35.117 --> 03:06:42.041]  So she tells me to tell that N, N-word, to please, you know, leave and get what she wants.
[03:06:42.681 --> 03:06:44.062]  I mean, that's very common.
[03:06:44.639 --> 03:06:46.440]  Not just gangs of kids anymore.
[03:06:46.780 --> 03:06:50.262]  They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators.
[03:06:50.582 --> 03:06:52.263]  No conscience, no empathy.
[03:06:52.584 --> 03:06:56.426]  We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.
[03:06:56.446 --> 03:07:05.531]  I mean, just the demeanor and, you know, and, you know, she would write things down like that to, you know,
[03:07:06.952 --> 03:07:17.846]  She had so many handlers, and when I worked for them in Washington, I used to think to myself, you know, because the parties aside, I thought, you know, this is great.
[03:07:17.906 --> 03:07:24.455]  I'm a kid that grew up on a small farm in Chautauqua County, and here I am working for the free leader of the world.
[03:07:25.325 --> 03:07:32.355]  So you sort of out, you know, you don't look at this other small stuff and then one day you realize, you know, they're really terrible people.
[03:07:32.715 --> 03:07:36.200]  They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators.
[03:07:36.360 --> 03:07:37.702]  We have to bring them to heal.
[03:07:37.822 --> 03:07:40.345]  Wow, so just to be clear, Tracy Martin.
[03:07:40.365 --> 03:07:41.207]  He's going to do us.
[03:07:41.787 --> 03:07:42.348]  Any better.
[03:07:42.368 --> 03:07:53.715]  I mean, she tells us one thing, she does something totally opposite, and now with all the WikiLeaks information coming out, everything that I've said for the last few years is all proven.
[03:07:54.135 --> 03:07:56.617]  Just like Donald Trump has said, it's all coming out.
[03:07:57.618 --> 03:08:04.222]  So, I think we've got a very, uh, I think we've got somebody saying here, we have to bring them to heel.
[03:08:04.302 --> 03:08:06.323]  Okay, we'll talk about it.
[03:08:06.463 --> 03:08:08.945]  I'm not a super predator, Hillary Clinton.
[03:08:08.965 --> 03:08:10.206]  We have to bring them to heel.
[03:08:24.151 --> 03:08:28.081]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:37.993 --> 03:08:40.814]  Alright, Paul Joseph Watson is going to get in the seat there.
[03:08:41.534 --> 03:08:43.155]  I can see he's not in his seat yet.
[03:08:43.335 --> 03:08:47.836]  Paul Joseph Watson, always on target from his Britannic Majesties, England.
[03:08:48.836 --> 03:08:52.537]  But when he comes back, we will hand the baton to him because I wanted to talk to Paul Watson.
[03:08:52.837 --> 03:08:54.998]  There he is, the elusive superstar.
[03:08:55.638 --> 03:08:56.859]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:08:56.879 --> 03:09:00.541]  Paul, I want you to take over the show because you're hard to even get to host one hour a week.
[03:09:00.761 --> 03:09:04.524]  You're so busy writing articles and fighting the globalists and dominating Twitter.
[03:09:04.544 --> 03:09:06.445]  Everybody says you're like the Twitter guy and Trump loves you.
[03:09:07.085 --> 03:09:08.066]  Always retweeting your stuff.
[03:09:09.127 --> 03:09:10.167]  What does your gut tell you?
[03:09:10.187 --> 03:09:12.369]  I mean, I don't just, you know me 16 years.
[03:09:12.429 --> 03:09:14.310]  I don't say what I want to believe.
[03:09:14.610 --> 03:09:15.491]  I really say what I think.
[03:09:16.311 --> 03:09:18.033]  And Trump, I think he's going to win in a landslide.
[03:09:18.073 --> 03:09:18.693]  He's got crowds of 20, 30, 40,000.
[03:09:18.773 --> 03:09:19.373]  He has 200, Cain has 30.
[03:09:19.413 --> 03:09:21.555]  There's election fraud news coming up though.
[03:09:25.298 --> 03:09:27.581]  Uh, we've got all the emails proving she's a total criminal.
[03:09:28.102 --> 03:09:31.328]  I mean, even if she skates in and steals it, she's never going to get away with this now.
[03:09:31.348 --> 03:09:34.613]  I mean, this makes the previous email stuff, we'll take a comparison.
[03:09:34.914 --> 03:09:36.757]  What does your gut tell you, Paul?
[03:09:38.843 --> 03:09:39.724]  I really don't know, Alex.
[03:09:39.964 --> 03:09:44.808]  I know that there's a hell of a lot of very stupid people, not just in America, but around the world.
[03:09:45.249 --> 03:09:53.596]  Many of them will have fallen for the propaganda that Trump is unstable, he's literally Hitler, he's got his hand on the nuclear button, he's gonna destroy the world.
[03:09:54.076 --> 03:09:58.861]  You know, and you can understand if people are weak-minded enough to be affected by that propaganda.
[03:09:59.401 --> 03:10:01.303]  It would stop them from voting for Trump.
[03:10:01.784 --> 03:10:11.154]  What I don't understand is, you know, we had Robbie Mook, the Clinton campaign manager on all the Sunday shows saying, oh, we're just amazed by the early voter turnout.
[03:10:11.174 --> 03:10:12.496]  There's so much enthusiasm.
[03:10:13.196 --> 03:10:18.802]  What kind of person wakes up in the morning on any morning, you know, if not November 8th and thinks,
[03:10:19.463 --> 03:10:20.584]  I know what I'm going to do today.
[03:10:20.644 --> 03:10:22.425]  I'm going to go and vote for Hillary Clinton.
[03:10:22.705 --> 03:10:26.848]  Who would have the enthusiasm to vote for Hillary Clinton?
[03:10:27.188 --> 03:10:29.370]  Where is all this enthusiasm coming from?
[03:10:29.690 --> 03:10:35.734]  You can see the videos of her supposed supporters at her own sparsely attended rallies.
[03:10:36.135 --> 03:10:42.479]  They have to be made to applaud and cheer exactly what the instigators want them to cheer.
[03:10:42.739 --> 03:10:45.881]  They have no spontaneous enthusiasm whatsoever.
[03:10:46.022 --> 03:10:47.783]  She is a cultural corpse.
[03:10:48.677 --> 03:10:52.614]  Like, this weekend with Bernie, just carting her around.
[03:10:53.971 --> 03:10:58.074]  Yeah, I mean, who would wake up and enthusiastically want to vote for Hillary Clinton?
[03:10:58.114 --> 03:10:59.414]  Well, yesterday was early voting.
[03:10:59.434 --> 03:11:02.937]  I went out and voted yesterday for Trump and I had that Trump is my president shirt on.
[03:11:03.457 --> 03:11:06.399]  I went in to vote and I wore my blue sweater and then I took it off.
[03:11:06.719 --> 03:11:13.063]  I put my I Voted sticker on and did like a victory lap on my motorcycle around Austin really quick for about 20 minutes and everyone's just kind of looking at me.
[03:11:13.443 --> 03:11:15.325]  But it was just like, you know, I was excited to do it.
[03:11:15.365 --> 03:11:15.905]  I was happy.
[03:11:15.965 --> 03:11:19.727]  I got up and I was like pumped to go out on early voting and cast mine.
[03:11:19.827 --> 03:11:20.448]  I was pretty happy.
[03:11:21.249 --> 03:11:25.690]  All right, Paul, I don't want to take your time, I don't want to hand the baton to you, but since we mentioned it earlier, I'm going to play this clip.
[03:11:26.130 --> 03:11:31.872]  This is Michael Moore, and this is Michael Moore saying Trump election will be the biggest FU in history.
[03:11:32.232 --> 03:11:39.713]  He admits by folks screwed over by NAFTA and GATT, but that's what Hillary and Clinton and all them rammed through, and the whole Republican establishment.
[03:11:39.773 --> 03:11:43.114]  How could any of these idiots not support Trump?
[03:11:43.154 --> 03:11:45.715]  I mean, Moore is such an anachronism.
[03:11:45.755 --> 03:11:46.175]  Here he is.
[03:11:47.695 --> 03:11:49.996]  A millionaire has the same number of votes
[03:11:50.979 --> 03:11:53.381]  As the person without a job, one.
[03:11:54.302 --> 03:11:59.446]  And there's more of the former middle class than there are in the millionaire class.
[03:12:00.687 --> 03:12:01.448]  So on November 8th,
[03:12:03.186 --> 03:12:23.256]  The dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain, and take that lever, or felt pen or touchscreen, and put a big f***ing X in the box by the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives.
[03:12:24.336 --> 03:12:25.997]  Donald J. Trump.
[03:12:27.284 --> 03:12:31.245]  They see that the elites who ruined their lives hate Trump.
[03:12:32.026 --> 03:12:33.326]  Corporate America hates Trump.
[03:12:34.386 --> 03:12:35.467]  Wall Street hates Trump.
[03:12:36.047 --> 03:12:37.848]  The career politicians hate Trump.
[03:12:38.668 --> 03:12:43.329]  The media hates Trump after they loved him and created him.
[03:12:44.310 --> 03:12:44.990]  And now hate him.
[03:12:45.710 --> 03:12:46.410]  Thank you, media.
[03:12:47.391 --> 03:12:50.752]  The enemy of my enemy is who I'm voting for on November 8th.
[03:12:51.823 --> 03:13:08.256]  Yes, on November 8th, you, Joe Blow, Steve Blow, Bob Blow, Billy Blow, Billy Bob Blow, all the blows, get to go and blow up the whole system because it's your right.
[03:13:08.776 --> 03:13:14.461]  Trump's election is going to be the biggest you ever recorded in human history.
[03:13:14.781 --> 03:13:16.142]  So it will feel good.
[03:13:17.623 --> 03:13:23.530]  So he runs around demonizing Trump all day, but then I've seen him several times act like he's actually for Trump, because he claims he's this grassroots guy.
[03:13:24.010 --> 03:13:29.917]  How could he, if he's against the corporate stuff, the big banks, all the corruption, they all hate Trump.
[03:13:30.577 --> 03:13:36.144]  This must be a serious identity crisis for all these fake liberals, because Trump is everything they plan to ever want.
[03:13:37.537 --> 03:13:45.186]  And then the White House is meeting with these rappers that talk about raping women, and then they're playing stuff with their kids while Trump's got some edited stuff from 11 years ago.
[03:13:45.206 --> 03:13:45.927]  It's the end of the world.
[03:13:46.427 --> 03:13:48.750]  I mean, that almost sounds like he's for Trump there.
[03:13:49.190 --> 03:13:50.272]  What do you think is happening here?
[03:13:50.292 --> 03:13:51.353]  I mean, is the truth coming out?
[03:13:51.393 --> 03:13:52.074]  Freudian slips?
[03:13:52.374 --> 03:13:53.736]  Paul Watson, I'm handing the baton to you.
[03:13:53.756 --> 03:13:54.116]  We're done.
[03:13:54.136 --> 03:13:54.677]  Go ahead, my friend.
[03:13:55.620 --> 03:13:56.441]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[03:13:56.721 --> 03:13:59.523]  I mean, maybe Michael Moore is a secret Trump voter.
[03:13:59.543 --> 03:14:02.946]  What's interesting about that clip is it started circulating last night.
[03:14:03.587 --> 03:14:05.308]  It got to the top of Reddit, I believe.
[03:14:05.789 --> 03:14:08.051]  And a lot of people were saying, that's fake!
[03:14:08.271 --> 03:14:10.993]  That's not even Michael Moore saying those words.
[03:14:11.053 --> 03:14:19.380]  And in fact, it took until today, where we got the actual video of Michael Moore sat there during this Trumpland event, saying those exact words.
[03:14:19.441 --> 03:14:21.462]  Yes, it is Michael Moore saying those words.
[03:14:21.762 --> 03:14:23.184]  But again, it illustrates the fact that
[03:14:23.584 --> 03:14:30.227]  You know, that was so supposedly out of character for Michael Moore that people thought that audio was actually fake when it's not.
[03:14:30.787 --> 03:14:43.794]  But one of my friends who is a liberal, he's quite prominent, he's a classical liberal in the sense he's not a leftist, he's not an SJW, but he sent me this comment and it ties in perfectly to the Michael Moore comment.
[03:14:44.454 --> 03:14:44.995]  Which is this.
[03:14:45.635 --> 03:14:59.967]  I'm just astonished, horrified by the way that statements made by Trump regarding globalization and the rigged system are entirely congruent with a quote liberal critique of crony capitalism slash lobbying etc.
[03:15:00.928 --> 03:15:07.717]  I mean, they could come out of the mouths of Noam Chomsky or Bernie Sanders with hardly a word changed.
[03:15:08.098 --> 03:15:15.227]  And yet, simply because they're coming out of Trump's orange mouth, these statements are either roundly ignored or misrepresented.
[03:15:15.707 --> 03:15:18.351]  So again, it goes back to what Michael Moore was saying in that clip.
[03:15:19.312 --> 03:15:35.317]  Trump is hated by Wall Street, he's hated by corporate America, he's hated by the political establishment, and he represents members of the middle class in America who have been completely screwed over, who have lost their livelihoods, thanks to big business and thanks to big government.
[03:15:35.597 --> 03:15:40.139]  The very interest that Michael Moore built his career on supposedly opposing.
[03:15:40.859 --> 03:15:47.841]  So when you see him come out with statements like that, obviously that wasn't in the full context, but, you know, word for word, that's what he said.
[03:15:47.901 --> 03:15:49.261]  It's not a fake audio tape.
[03:15:49.921 --> 03:15:51.022]  It's very interesting.
[03:15:51.442 --> 03:15:53.742]  And by the way, we are showing the video since you mentioned it.
[03:15:53.782 --> 03:15:57.183]  The video did later come out, somebody in the audience first recorded it and got it out.
[03:15:57.243 --> 03:16:02.005]  And the fact that they denied it when clearly he was at the event, clearly he said it was even in newspapers.
[03:16:02.605 --> 03:16:07.186]  They're so in denial because when he finally tells the truth, it doesn't fit into the larger narrative.
[03:16:08.424 --> 03:16:13.685]  Well, I changed the Infowars article, so now you can actually see the video of him saying it in that article.
[03:16:14.085 --> 03:16:18.826]  But again, he knows that Trump supporters, as he said, they're not just racist rednecks.
[03:16:18.886 --> 03:16:29.728]  They're voting for Trump because he got up in front of the Ford executives and said, if you try and sell those cars back to America from Mexico, I'm going to slap a 35% tariff on you.
[03:16:30.068 --> 03:16:36.389]  He's not going to settle for that crony capitalism that, again, Michael Moore built his career on opposing.
[03:16:36.869 --> 03:16:38.010]  So again, he gets it.
[03:16:38.070 --> 03:16:42.251]  A lot of these Hillary supporters in the media, these elitists, don't get it.
[03:16:42.311 --> 03:16:49.595]  They still think that Trump's entire support base is formulated around racist rhetoric.
[03:16:50.635 --> 03:16:52.296]  This is what Henry Ford pioneered.
[03:16:52.616 --> 03:16:54.797]  You've got to make enough money to be able to buy the product.
[03:16:55.257 --> 03:17:01.540]  Globalism is this thing where they make us impoverished by not ever having an economy to be able to buy the product in the end.
[03:17:01.960 --> 03:17:04.601]  And now we're getting towards the end game when everybody's going broke.
[03:17:04.662 --> 03:17:05.362]  This is not good.
[03:17:07.318 --> 03:17:10.119]  No, and that's whose interest Trump represents.
[03:17:10.540 --> 03:17:23.486]  It's not just people lashing out because they're racist, but the elite's obsession with that, their misrepresentation, their misconception that that is what drives Trump voters, is what could possibly cost them this election.
[03:17:23.526 --> 03:17:24.747]  We saw it with Brexit.
[03:17:25.267 --> 03:17:27.968]  Again, they were overconfident right before the vote.
[03:17:28.288 --> 03:17:31.310]  They thought, oh, only provincial racists are going to support Brexit.
[03:17:31.630 --> 03:17:37.991]  Well no, it was 17 million people, the biggest vote in a UK election ever, and they lost.
[03:17:38.231 --> 03:17:44.113]  And they weren't expecting it, because all the polls before said that it was a comfortable victory for the Remainers.
[03:17:44.393 --> 03:17:55.815]  They got slapped in the face, they got shocked, because they couldn't identify who was voting for Brexit and why, because of their ivory tower elitism, and that's what Michael Moore's talking about in that clip.
[03:17:56.783 --> 03:18:00.186]  Plus, Paul, they demonize everybody that stands up for common sense, fairness.
[03:18:00.806 --> 03:18:02.067]  Nationalism is racist.
[03:18:02.528 --> 03:18:05.750]  The average person doesn't want to be called that, so they're very quiet about their views.
[03:18:05.771 --> 03:18:11.335]  And that's what internal pollsters for Trump know, is there's a good 10% of people that are closeted.
[03:18:11.355 --> 03:18:15.999]  I mean, I wear Trump stuff out just as an exercise in front of my kids.
[03:18:16.720 --> 03:18:17.741]  And people mess with us.
[03:18:17.761 --> 03:18:18.841]  They say stuff here in Austin.
[03:18:18.861 --> 03:18:19.562]  They're very nasty.
[03:18:21.724 --> 03:18:23.665]  No, there is that contingent, but again,
[03:18:24.724 --> 03:18:26.285]  This has been way underplayed.
[03:18:26.305 --> 03:18:30.269]  There's something going on behind the scenes which is not quantifiable by these polls.
[03:18:30.309 --> 03:18:43.341]  And yes, it's partly Hillary's campaign admittedly now in the WikiLeaks document saying, we're going to use this as a tactic to try and convince Trump supporters to lose enthusiasm, saying that it's all tied up, it's in the bag, Hillary's won.
[03:18:43.761 --> 03:18:45.323]  And then you drill into the polls.
[03:18:45.403 --> 03:18:47.444]  And it's the same with the debate polls we've seen.
[03:18:47.845 --> 03:18:50.888]  They oversample Democrats every single time.
[03:18:51.548 --> 03:18:55.612]  In some cases by like 26% Republicans to 40 odd percent Democrats.
[03:18:55.692 --> 03:18:58.095]  And there are easier ways but more sophisticated to steal it.
[03:18:58.115 --> 03:19:01.278]  I'm gonna skip this break so you have more time, Paul, but this is just riveting here listening to you talk.
[03:19:02.219 --> 03:19:03.460]  Why are they so arrogant?
[03:19:03.480 --> 03:19:08.284]  They've always been arrogant, but it seems like they're completely mentally ill now, have no idea all the credibility they've lost.
[03:19:09.008 --> 03:19:12.291]  We have a press conference and 30 million people watch.
[03:19:12.891 --> 03:19:14.713]  CNN doesn't have that in a week, brother.
[03:19:15.193 --> 03:19:18.676]  I mean, you originally have videos with 15, 20 million views.
[03:19:18.716 --> 03:19:19.196]  We do too.
[03:19:19.817 --> 03:19:22.959]  I mean, have they figured out yet how pathetic they are?
[03:19:23.320 --> 03:19:24.461]  I think they're figuring it out.
[03:19:24.901 --> 03:19:30.943]  They had a Washington Post article and an Austin American Statesman article last week admitting InfoWars is bigger than quote, any mainstream show.
[03:19:31.203 --> 03:19:32.544]  So they're now admitting that fact.
[03:19:32.964 --> 03:19:34.004]  We're just one part of this.
[03:19:34.064 --> 03:19:35.585]  Drudge, bigger than all of them combined.
[03:19:35.985 --> 03:19:38.606]  Facebook and New York Times combined, but they're still so arrogant.
[03:19:38.966 --> 03:19:43.527]  So there's almost like the Schizophrenia now, where they're still super arrogant, but they realize we're way bigger than them.
[03:19:43.587 --> 03:19:45.248]  So, what comes out of that paradox?
[03:19:47.116 --> 03:19:49.557]  I think some of them are starting to get it, but most aren't.
[03:19:49.597 --> 03:20:00.944]  I mean, I've talked about that Daily Show clip with Trevor Noah freaking out about this conservative Trump supporter getting tens of millions of views on Facebook, but Brian Stelter of CNN came out last night.
[03:20:01.404 --> 03:20:03.945]  You know, he's this big anti-Trump leftist on CNN.
[03:20:05.126 --> 03:20:09.668]  Basically saying, Trump only gets 60,000 views on his Facebook videos.
[03:20:10.029 --> 03:20:13.671]  Now for a start, I went on Trump's Facebook about 30 minutes ago.
[03:20:14.051 --> 03:20:15.472]  Literally every video.
[03:20:15.612 --> 03:20:19.714]  And they upload numerous videos a day.
[03:20:19.894 --> 03:20:21.895]  800,000, 900,000, 1.5 million, 2 million views.
[03:20:22.355 --> 03:20:23.436]  Every single video.
[03:20:23.796 --> 03:20:25.437]  So again, he got that completely wrong.
[03:20:25.477 --> 03:20:30.560]  And then he bragged about having 1.35 million viewers a week on his own show.
[03:20:31.480 --> 03:20:44.145]  James O'Keefe shot back and said, quote, our YouTube videos have 10 million views in the last seven days, 54 million Twitter impressions for James O'Keefe over the last seven days.
[03:20:44.706 --> 03:20:52.649]  I mean, just on my little Twitter account, I'm getting 165 million Twitter impressions every single month.
[03:20:52.729 --> 03:20:57.611]  Paul, Paul, if you count all of our channels and affiliated channels, we have 5 billion views, 1 billion on one channel.
[03:20:57.631 --> 03:20:59.111]  We're trying to take down right now, by the way, folks.
[03:20:59.272 --> 03:20:59.852]  We're under attack.
[03:21:00.672 --> 03:21:05.375]  And if you add it all together, we're getting 4 to 5 million views a day just on our channels, Paul.
[03:21:07.016 --> 03:21:07.796]  No, it's insane.
[03:21:08.076 --> 03:21:12.779]  We've only just started properly uploading videos to Twitter, which is an entirely new avenue.
[03:21:13.099 --> 03:21:15.320]  So you can add on, you know, 200, 300,000 views for every video on that.
[03:21:15.340 --> 03:21:17.501]  The point is, we're absolutely kissing their ass.
[03:21:17.541 --> 03:21:19.762]  And it's not about measuring our Johnsons here.
[03:21:20.102 --> 03:21:22.584]  The point is, they're in decline, we're rising, what do they do?
[03:21:25.171 --> 03:21:27.574]  I think they haven't realised it yet, Alex.
[03:21:27.795 --> 03:21:31.179]  I mean, I get, you know, 300,000 followers on Twitter.
[03:21:31.219 --> 03:21:32.561]  That's the current level of it.
[03:21:32.641 --> 03:21:34.944]  And, you know, 165 million impressions.
[03:21:35.305 --> 03:21:39.811]  I get more impressions than celebrities with 10 million Twitter followers.
[03:21:40.131 --> 03:21:41.212]  Oh, and that's the thing.
[03:21:41.252 --> 03:21:46.357]  They put together these huge Hollywood produced deals with like 30 stars on YouTube with full YouTube push.
[03:21:46.597 --> 03:21:49.200]  It gets 100,000, 90% downvotes.
[03:21:49.480 --> 03:21:51.743]  We do nothing to put out a video that gets a million.
[03:21:52.043 --> 03:21:57.288]  I mean, I'll cut four or five videos in a week and they'll get like two or three million views conservatively, and I'm just shooting it at my house.
[03:21:57.909 --> 03:22:00.812]  And then they have all these stars and everyone is saying, we hate you.
[03:22:02.349 --> 03:22:04.130]  And it's, again, we're not bragging.
[03:22:04.611 --> 03:22:05.591]  I'll give you another example.
[03:22:05.611 --> 03:22:13.557]  You know, one of these Never Trumpers, Louise Mensch, writes an article saying that I'm in control, Infowars is controlling the Putin troll bots.
[03:22:13.937 --> 03:22:16.939]  It gets five comments in 24 hours.
[03:22:16.959 --> 03:22:18.320]  This is on quite a big website.
[03:22:18.680 --> 03:22:20.541]  Five comments in 24 hours.
[03:22:21.462 --> 03:22:27.086]  The article this morning about the vote fraud in Texas, it's probably passed 4,000 comments by now.
[03:22:27.486 --> 03:22:33.210]  It got over five comments in probably ten seconds because our information resonates.
[03:22:33.390 --> 03:22:43.997]  And let's be clear, let's be clear, it's true that Russian TV takes what we say word for word and Japanese TV and all the others and Mainline Talk Radio and Congress because we know what we're talking about.
[03:22:44.318 --> 03:22:45.598]  We broke Benghazi first.
[03:22:45.618 --> 03:22:46.639]  We broke it all first.
[03:22:46.899 --> 03:22:48.721]  It's not that the Russians take their orders.
[03:22:49.041 --> 03:22:50.542]  They know truth when they hear it.
[03:22:50.762 --> 03:22:54.525]  We're kicking your ass up one side and down the other, you little arrogant
[03:22:55.441 --> 03:22:59.023]  Pencil-necked, establishment, fake liberal, fascist dirtbags.
[03:23:00.664 --> 03:23:01.064]  Exactly.
[03:23:01.104 --> 03:23:03.665]  I mean, another part of it is they're very lazy.
[03:23:03.685 --> 03:23:06.287]  I mean, we instantaneously react to news.
[03:23:06.327 --> 03:23:07.687]  We're able to get on top of it right away.
[03:23:07.727 --> 03:23:08.207]  We're completely crazy.
[03:23:08.228 --> 03:23:09.208]  We work 18 hours a day.
[03:23:09.248 --> 03:23:10.229]  I literally foam at the mouth.
[03:23:10.269 --> 03:23:10.849]  Let's just be honest.
[03:23:11.718 --> 03:23:34.711]  Yeah, but I mean, talking about Russia, you've then got comments by the former Prime Minister of Sweden, Carl Bildt, who put out this tweet which he claimed that Russia today got the WikiLeaks before WikiLeaks published them, simply because they tweeted, for example, about Podesta email part 17 before WikiLeaks released it on Twitter or tweeted about it on Twitter.
[03:23:35.151 --> 03:23:40.453]  He said, quote, really impressive by Russian state media to report on WikiLeaks releases before they are released.
[03:23:40.713 --> 03:23:41.734]  Contacts count.
[03:23:42.254 --> 03:23:49.177]  Now, of course, the Podesta emails are released on WikiLeaks' website way before they actually tweet it out.
[03:23:49.237 --> 03:23:57.740]  That's how RT is able to put out that story, because they sit there like I did yesterday, refreshing the website to get on the story first.
[03:23:58.060 --> 03:23:59.040]  We're not lazy.
[03:23:59.360 --> 03:23:59.821]  You are.
[03:24:00.101 --> 03:24:03.042]  That's why we're kicking your ass, and they're not happy about it.
[03:24:05.310 --> 03:24:06.491]  Wow, this is biblical.
[03:24:06.711 --> 03:24:08.453]  All right, well, I said I'd let you take over.
[03:24:08.473 --> 03:24:09.794]  This is just great to talk to you, Paul.
[03:24:09.814 --> 03:24:12.316]  I got a hold of Paul, so you guys can get him on air with us.
[03:24:14.398 --> 03:24:15.419]  What else is coming up in the next 35 minutes?
[03:24:17.702 --> 03:24:18.743]  What are your big concerns?
[03:24:18.783 --> 03:24:20.725]  Because, I mean, let me tell you, they're desperate.
[03:24:20.785 --> 03:24:21.766]  They want to be the heroes.
[03:24:21.786 --> 03:24:23.067]  I smell false flag.
[03:24:23.147 --> 03:24:26.770]  I smell them stealing the election, blowing something up, blaming it on us.
[03:24:26.810 --> 03:24:28.172]  I mean, I just see nastiness.
[03:24:28.592 --> 03:24:29.413]  I see the preparation.
[03:24:29.433 --> 03:24:30.434]  I want to shut down the media.
[03:24:30.494 --> 03:24:31.715]  I think they're going to go all in.
[03:24:31.955 --> 03:24:38.201]  They're either going to back off and realize that they can't stop us and try to just sabotage us, or they're going to go all in, Paul.
[03:24:40.080 --> 03:24:46.183]  Well, I think the only guarantee is you will see riots after the election if Trump wins.
[03:24:46.523 --> 03:24:48.063]  I mean, that's the guarantee, isn't it?
[03:24:48.143 --> 03:24:53.746]  Now that we know, again, that whole thing about, oh, Trump's rhetoric is responsible for the violence at his own rallies.
[03:24:54.006 --> 03:24:55.807]  Don't you dare say anyone else is responsible.
[03:24:55.827 --> 03:24:56.947]  That's the conspiracy theory.
[03:24:57.607 --> 03:24:59.568]  O'Keefe video completely debunked.
[03:24:59.608 --> 03:25:00.368]  They funded it.
[03:25:00.629 --> 03:25:01.369]  They arranged it.
[03:25:01.409 --> 03:25:04.050]  And we have WikiLeaks on top of it, not just O'Keefe.
[03:25:04.770 --> 03:25:06.211]  We have the WikiLeaks that couple with it.
[03:25:07.293 --> 03:25:07.753]  Exactly.
[03:25:08.053 --> 03:25:09.774]  So, that's proven.
[03:25:09.894 --> 03:25:13.975]  They fund, they arrange violence against Trump, against his supporters.
[03:25:14.295 --> 03:25:19.236]  That's why you see graffiti daubed everywhere, Republican HQs being firebombed.
[03:25:19.557 --> 03:25:21.437]  That's what you're going to see if Trump wins.
[03:25:21.477 --> 03:25:22.417]  That's the only guarantee.
[03:25:22.817 --> 03:25:26.278]  All because he doesn't want to start a war with someone doing nothing to us!
[03:25:26.819 --> 03:25:27.919]  Because he's a good person!
[03:25:29.633 --> 03:25:31.054]  Well, I mean, that's the problem.
[03:25:31.094 --> 03:25:48.244]  While, you know, Russians are being told where to find their nearest nuclear bunker, Americans are being told to obsess about some ex-porn star who says that Trump asked for her phone number just coincidentally the day before she's got this big video release or whatever and she wants national press attention.
[03:25:48.624 --> 03:25:50.646]  That's what Americans are being told to consume.
[03:25:51.046 --> 03:26:00.536]  Russians are being told, find your nearest nuclear bunker because there's a pretty good chance there could be a massive nuclear holocaust in World War 3 if Hillary Clinton is elected.
[03:26:00.956 --> 03:26:04.499]  So again, that's the split between the mainstream... And then they spin it and claim Trump's gonna cause World War 3.
[03:26:05.964 --> 03:26:11.648]  Yeah, exactly, but the riots will only happen if Trump wins, because those are the people who riot.
[03:26:12.088 --> 03:26:16.211]  Those are the people who are paid to riot by the DNC, by Hillary Clinton's network.
[03:26:16.251 --> 03:26:16.892]  Well, I want to say this.
[03:26:16.932 --> 03:26:18.813]  We have proof Soros is funding it in the emails.
[03:26:18.933 --> 03:26:19.714]  We already have proof.
[03:26:19.974 --> 03:26:20.955]  We have proof she's doing it.
[03:26:21.975 --> 03:26:28.320]  We need to start seeing grand juries grow up, not be cowards at the state level, Democrats do this all the time, and start indicting people.
[03:26:28.860 --> 03:26:30.483]  I mean, we need to start indictments now.
[03:26:30.543 --> 03:26:32.125]  And I don't want to hear it, oh, it's too dangerous.
[03:26:32.405 --> 03:26:33.888]  I'm sticking my neck way out here, folks.
[03:26:34.208 --> 03:26:35.270]  Just stop being cowards.
[03:26:35.310 --> 03:26:36.351]  I mean, you know what I mean, Paul?
[03:26:38.334 --> 03:26:44.940]  Exactly, and the other narrative they've got going is, you know, Barack Obama, oh, Trump's whining about the rigged election.
[03:26:45.220 --> 03:26:51.565]  Well, first up, there's a new poll which shows that only four in ten Americans are confident that there won't be election fraud.
[03:26:51.906 --> 03:26:56.449]  So Obama's accusing the majority of the population of the country of whining.
[03:26:57.110 --> 03:26:59.112]  Secondly, there's a new study that came out.
[03:26:59.572 --> 03:27:05.417]  They studied coverage on ABC, CBS and NBC Evening News from the 29th of July to October 20.
[03:27:06.698 --> 03:27:19.549]  Categorizing how many minutes they spent on each topic, 91% of television coverage from those dates on ABC, CBS and NBC Evening News was negative, was hostile.
[03:27:20.810 --> 03:27:22.811]  91% of coverage was hostile about Donald Trump.
[03:27:23.252 --> 03:27:24.053]  They broke it down.
[03:27:24.793 --> 03:27:27.515]  Controversies involving Trump.
[03:27:28.215 --> 03:27:30.056]  440 minutes spent on those controversies.
[03:27:30.116 --> 03:27:31.777]  Controversies involving Hillary Clinton.
[03:27:32.157 --> 03:27:35.299]  Only 185 minutes, less than half.
[03:27:35.839 --> 03:27:41.002]  Proof positive of rigged media by the numbers, not by Trump whining.
[03:27:41.522 --> 03:27:46.145]  You can look at the coverage of Trump's alleged sexist behavior compared to Bill Clinton's.
[03:27:46.485 --> 03:27:51.027]  A 15 to 1 disparity on those network news shows.
[03:27:51.067 --> 03:27:53.889]  Which basically means total blackout, but it's not working, so what do they do?
[03:27:55.865 --> 03:27:57.506]  Well, I mean, we'll see if it worked.
[03:27:57.546 --> 03:28:03.391]  They did a poll which found that 55% thought the media's coverage had been biased against Trump.
[03:28:03.852 --> 03:28:05.133]  It should be way more than that.
[03:28:05.213 --> 03:28:10.237]  So as I said, unfortunately, you've got a lot of weak-minded, stupid people who still support this propaganda.
[03:28:10.257 --> 03:28:11.378]  Sure, but isn't the cherry on top?
[03:28:11.538 --> 03:28:13.619]  Obamacare has already doubled premiums on average.
[03:28:13.920 --> 03:28:14.961]  Now another 25% increase.
[03:28:15.001 --> 03:28:16.222]  It was supposed to be free.
[03:28:16.242 --> 03:28:22.567]  I mean, can't their constituents really grow up and realize mainstream media is there to slit their throats?
[03:28:24.534 --> 03:28:31.939]  Well again, it's this idea of they're losing their power, they're losing their influence, but they still have a unified narrative.
[03:28:31.999 --> 03:28:36.683]  So they all report the same thing on the evening news with the same spin, the same smear.
[03:28:36.923 --> 03:28:37.343]  It's a cult!
[03:28:37.403 --> 03:28:40.946]  Yeah, but that's going to wash away increasingly.
[03:28:42.927 --> 03:28:45.369]  They've been completely disproven on the Hillary's health thing.
[03:28:45.389 --> 03:28:48.671]  They had to come out and admit, yeah, we smeared everyone as conspiracy theorists.
[03:28:48.691 --> 03:28:49.211]  We were wrong.
[03:28:49.632 --> 03:28:50.832]  So we won on that score.
[03:28:51.233 --> 03:28:54.415]  You know, what else is going to come out where they're going to have to at least admit this?
[03:28:54.895 --> 03:29:00.979]  Could there be, there have been rumors of another tape coming out in which Hillary Clinton makes racist comments.
[03:29:01.019 --> 03:29:07.003]  We know from eyewitnesses like Tracy Martin, the former Clinton chef, that she does that on a regular basis.
[03:29:07.083 --> 03:29:07.944]  She is a nasty woman.
[03:29:08.004 --> 03:29:12.207]  Everybody I've talked to says that she just spews, if she sees anybody with color, just
[03:29:12.967 --> 03:29:13.788]  It's just horrible.
[03:29:13.848 --> 03:29:14.348]  It's like, what?
[03:29:14.468 --> 03:29:15.649]  I mean, this is crazy town.
[03:29:15.969 --> 03:29:17.249]  And it's not like I'm being holier-than-thou.
[03:29:17.289 --> 03:29:18.170]  Oh my God, she's racist stuff.
[03:29:18.190 --> 03:29:20.631]  I mean, I've never heard that, except from scum.
[03:29:20.971 --> 03:29:22.732]  It's like, this woman is super powerful.
[03:29:22.972 --> 03:29:24.353]  She claims she loves these people.
[03:29:24.433 --> 03:29:25.234]  They love her.
[03:29:25.494 --> 03:29:26.374]  And then she hates them.
[03:29:26.474 --> 03:29:28.696]  I mean, how do you hate people that love you?
[03:29:28.956 --> 03:29:29.436]  I don't get it.
[03:29:31.297 --> 03:29:36.540]  Because she's a sociopath and she has extreme difficulty in connecting to other human beings.
[03:29:37.993 --> 03:29:38.893]  You take over, Paul.
[03:29:38.913 --> 03:29:40.394]  You gotta come on the show more.
[03:29:40.474 --> 03:29:42.975]  It's always great to have Paul Watson from InfoWars.com.
[03:29:43.255 --> 03:29:43.835]  He's taking over.
[03:29:43.855 --> 03:29:44.376]  I'm punching out.
[03:29:44.416 --> 03:29:45.796]  Not only news tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[03:29:46.136 --> 03:29:47.517]  Please support the broadcast.

[03:29:53.619 --> 03:29:54.259]  We need the funding.
[03:29:54.299 --> 03:29:55.040]  God bless you all.
[03:29:59.061 --> 03:29:59.962]  We're on the march.
[03:30:00.422 --> 03:30:02.042]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.963 --> 03:30:05.644]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.676 --> 03:30:10.997]  We're red on election day.
[03:30:11.117 --> 03:30:14.080]  Perhaps the biggest election in American history is just days away.
[03:30:14.240 --> 03:30:18.824]  We know that in past elections, there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud and election fraud.
[03:30:18.844 --> 03:30:26.090]  From dead people voting, to people registering false identifications, to government leaders providing fast-track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes.
[03:30:26.270 --> 03:30:27.731]  This is happening right in front of us.
[03:30:27.931 --> 03:30:32.335]  Now we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen after the Republican nominee, Donald Trump.
[03:30:32.415 --> 03:30:34.317]  Government shills are campaigning for Clinton.
[03:30:34.417 --> 03:30:37.580]  Mainstream news attacking Donald Trump all day like rabbit hounds.
[03:30:37.780 --> 03:30:44.526]  Rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics that Hillary Clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting Trump.
[03:30:44.646 --> 03:30:47.208]  Fake celebrities endorsing Clinton across all platforms.
[03:30:47.428 --> 03:30:50.651]  So with all this, what are we doing to keep this election from being stolen?
[03:30:50.891 --> 03:30:52.693]  What can we do to prevent election fraud?
[03:30:52.893 --> 03:30:55.994]  I propose that all Donald Trump supporters wear red on Election Day.
[03:30:56.114 --> 03:30:59.876]  On November 8th, when you head to the polls to vote Donald Trump, be decked out in red.
[03:30:59.976 --> 03:31:06.039]  This way, just as we dominated in rally turnout, we can prove and provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout.
[03:31:06.119 --> 03:31:09.000]  Wear red on Election Day, and Make America Great Again!
[03:31:09.680 --> 03:31:13.541]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:13.841 --> 03:31:21.123]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[03:31:21.303 --> 03:31:32.326]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[03:31:32.766 --> 03:31:40.309]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[03:31:40.389 --> 03:31:44.330]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today.
[03:31:44.470 --> 03:31:54.434]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.

[03:32:09.611 --> 03:32:18.638]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:32:18.718 --> 03:32:26.945]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:32:27.125 --> 03:32:31.789]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:32:31.989 --> 03:32:38.713]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:38.773 --> 03:32:45.857]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:32:45.957 --> 03:32:52.821]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:32:52.981 --> 03:32:57.323]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:32:57.463 --> 03:33:00.665]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:33:00.845 --> 03:33:06.968]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:33:07.128 --> 03:33:08.848]  Available at Infowarslive.com.
[03:33:21.574 --> 03:33:26.076]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:32.006 --> 03:33:32.467]  We are back.
[03:33:32.547 --> 03:33:36.831]  It's the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show with me, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:37.231 --> 03:33:42.737]  Gonna go to our guest here in a second, but I wanted to hit on a couple of headlines on the same topic.
[03:33:43.017 --> 03:33:44.358]  These are up on Infowars.com.
[03:33:44.879 --> 03:33:49.163]  Murders in Sweden up 80% in two years.
[03:33:49.243 --> 03:33:52.907]  That's right, the liberal basket case of Sweden that we so often pick on.
[03:33:53.607 --> 03:33:56.189]  ...is still enjoying its cultural enrichment.
[03:33:56.650 --> 03:34:04.016]  Sweden, which again I believe is what, 8-9 million population, is likely to get around 160 murders this year.
[03:34:04.076 --> 03:34:09.580]  That compares to 115 murders last year, and only 87 murders in 2014.
[03:34:10.481 --> 03:34:20.069]  Now could that be connected to the tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Muslim migrants that they've been importing over the last two years?
[03:34:20.729 --> 03:34:22.250]  Surely just a coincidence.
[03:34:22.290 --> 03:34:28.292]  You look at neighbouring Norway, which had in comparison just 23 murders in 2015.
[03:34:28.533 --> 03:34:31.354]  So a massive disparity.
[03:34:31.814 --> 03:34:33.475]  Murders are on the rise in Sweden.
[03:34:33.815 --> 03:34:38.677]  We've got areas of Sweden like Malmo being described as war zones.
[03:34:38.697 --> 03:34:46.681]  You've got Somali immigrants saying they want to go back home because it's safer in Somalia than it is in some areas of Sweden.
[03:34:47.481 --> 03:34:53.504]  We have another headline, Sweden bans Christmas streetlights to avoid offending Muslim migrants question mark.
[03:34:54.084 --> 03:35:02.168]  Of course the authorities claim that they've banned Christmas streetlights in all these towns and cities for safety reasons.
[03:35:02.228 --> 03:35:07.770]  It's got nothing whatsoever to do with offending the tens of thousands of Muslim migrants who have poured in.
[03:35:08.211 --> 03:35:10.452]  People aren't buying that explanation.
[03:35:11.272 --> 03:35:15.996]  So we're talking about Sweden and now we're going to go to our guest who has been on the show before.
[03:35:16.517 --> 03:35:19.599]  He's the Angry Foreigner, that's his moniker on YouTube.
[03:35:19.619 --> 03:35:22.042]  You can search for that on Twitter as well and find him.
[03:35:22.722 --> 03:35:28.747]  And he's a Bosnian immigrant living in Sweden who, as I said, has built this very popular YouTube channel.
[03:35:29.328 --> 03:35:34.472]  Thanks in part, and it's very rare to have this in Sweden, or in fact in many places in Europe,
[03:35:35.313 --> 03:35:40.059]  Due to his willingness to tell the truth about mass uncontrolled immigration.
[03:35:40.240 --> 03:35:45.307]  He put out a video yesterday, which I posted on Twitter, which we're going to get into in a second.
[03:35:45.687 --> 03:35:47.109]  But first to set the scene.
[03:35:48.055 --> 03:35:51.896]  I mean, I've got friends that visit Sweden on a regular basis, every month.
[03:35:52.296 --> 03:35:53.697]  Specifically, Malmo.
[03:35:54.077 --> 03:35:56.837]  The stories they tell me are horrific.
[03:35:57.157 --> 03:36:00.038]  They're saying it's far worse than the media is reporting.
[03:36:00.418 --> 03:36:07.300]  They're talking about it being a common occurrence for people to walk down the street and just hear firebombs going off.
[03:36:07.680 --> 03:36:11.721]  We've seen reports of cars set on fire, sometimes dozens a night.
[03:36:12.242 --> 03:36:17.023]  We've seen, according to them, ISIS flags being flown at Islamist rallies.
[03:36:17.543 --> 03:36:23.406]  So they walk past the protests and they're literally flying ISIS flags at these protests.
[03:36:23.846 --> 03:36:24.686]  Not in Raqqa!
[03:36:24.706 --> 03:36:26.187]  Not in Mosul!
[03:36:26.767 --> 03:36:27.808]  In Sweden!
[03:36:29.070 --> 03:36:33.711]  You know, they just legalized the ISIS flag in Sweden.
[03:36:34.071 --> 03:36:41.992]  We've got people now in Sweden, in Malmo, imposing self-imposed curfews because they're afraid of what's happening.
[03:36:42.432 --> 03:36:44.313]  Migrants harassing women on the street.
[03:36:44.693 --> 03:36:51.154]  Reports of sexual assaults at these music festivals that the authorities again are trying to keep under wraps.
[03:36:51.914 --> 03:36:57.415]  Now obviously, you know, it's worse in some areas compared to others, but I want to ask the angry foreigner who joins us now.
[03:36:58.208 --> 03:37:02.791]  You know, how does the media's reporting and what we learn as outsiders fit with reality?
[03:37:03.272 --> 03:37:08.475]  Are these problems actually a lot worse than what they're saying, than what they're reporting?
[03:37:09.936 --> 03:37:14.619]  Well, I'd like to say that since the last time we talked, things have gotten both worse and better.
[03:37:15.220 --> 03:37:17.881]  What's worse is that we're seeing more of the same old issues.
[03:37:18.082 --> 03:37:25.527]  I mean, there's stories about a new migrant rape almost on a weekly basis now, and bathhouses and music festivals have basically become unsafe places for women.
[03:37:26.007 --> 03:37:29.970]  We're seeing a new type of sex crime, where migrant gangs team up and molest women.
[03:37:30.470 --> 03:37:35.874]  What's changed for the better, though, is that the mainstream media has actually finally started reporting more on these issues.
[03:37:36.234 --> 03:37:40.397]  And that changed around the time of the New Year's Eve attack in Cologne, Germany.
[03:37:41.317 --> 03:37:43.919]  It's like all of a sudden the taboos disappeared overnight.
[03:37:44.019 --> 03:37:49.303]  It became acceptable to criticize the view of women in foreign cultures and immigrant-related crime.
[03:37:49.743 --> 03:37:53.966]  And there's been a bunch of debate articles about that by established people and established media outlets.
[03:37:54.534 --> 03:37:59.156]  So I feel like there's an overall change for the better in the social debate about these things.
[03:37:59.556 --> 03:38:00.877]  It's more okay to talk about it now.
[03:38:01.577 --> 03:38:03.718]  And people are even more fed up with the racist label.
[03:38:03.838 --> 03:38:05.699]  But we're far from perfect.
[03:38:05.839 --> 03:38:07.879]  I mean, there's a lot of stuff that isn't being covered.
[03:38:08.060 --> 03:38:13.362]  And as usual, you have to go to the alternative media to get the full picture, so to speak.
[03:38:14.082 --> 03:38:20.985]  And what happened on Gotland recently with the wheelchair-bound woman really goes to show that we're far from perfect.
[03:38:22.039 --> 03:38:23.260]  Yeah, let's get into that again.
[03:38:23.980 --> 03:38:26.661]  You said basically one rape per week now.
[03:38:26.981 --> 03:38:28.622]  We post the stories routinely.
[03:38:29.043 --> 03:38:30.823]  We had this harrowing incident.
[03:38:30.863 --> 03:38:33.545]  A woman in a wheelchair gang-raped by migrants.
[03:38:33.805 --> 03:38:37.167]  Explain what happened and then the fallout from that afterwards.
[03:38:38.287 --> 03:38:44.428]  Well, basically, she was visiting a restaurant in the evening, and she shared a cab home with a migrant.
[03:38:45.409 --> 03:38:47.169]  From what I understand, she didn't know him personally.
[03:38:47.329 --> 03:38:52.110]  And when she arrived, she asked if she could use his bathroom.
[03:38:52.890 --> 03:38:59.251]  What ended up happening is that five migrants raped her for hours on end in that bathroom.
[03:38:59.491 --> 03:39:06.453]  They took the wheelchair away from her, and when she was finally able to escape, the first thing she did was call the police.
[03:39:07.293 --> 03:39:19.825]  But what happened then was that they took them into custody for hearing but released them shortly after because the prosecutor didn't feel like the woman's story was robust enough and he didn't feel that she fought back enough.
[03:39:20.286 --> 03:39:22.748]  So they were released out of custody.
[03:39:22.868 --> 03:39:26.612]  This is a woman in a wheelchair and they're saying she didn't fight back enough.
[03:39:27.196 --> 03:39:29.699]  Yeah, despite the fact that she had documented injuries.
[03:39:30.540 --> 03:39:36.007]  So naturally, people became absolutely furious, and a demonstration took place.
[03:39:36.547 --> 03:39:42.555]  And the purpose there was just to protest the decision to let these suspects go, and to show support for the women.
[03:39:43.183 --> 03:39:49.707]  But what ended up happening after that is that every magazine on Gotland labelled them as Nazis.
[03:39:49.967 --> 03:39:55.010]  And the mainstream media in Sweden as well labelled them as Nazis as well.
[03:39:55.990 --> 03:40:04.175]  Basically it was a huge smear campaign against these ordinary citizens who weren't even politically aligned in any special team.
[03:40:04.235 --> 03:40:05.896]  They just felt it was messed up.
[03:40:06.837 --> 03:40:14.147]  And also, the feminist party and the left party on Gotland arranged a demonstration against racism and sexism.
[03:40:14.608 --> 03:40:19.354]  Because they didn't like the enticed debates online.
[03:40:20.015 --> 03:40:21.157]  The angry reactions.
[03:40:21.197 --> 03:40:22.339]  They wanted to protest that.
[03:40:22.932 --> 03:40:36.843]  So you had a defenseless woman in a wheelchair being gang-raped by migrant men, and the feminist response was to come out and slam people who were upset about that, not to actually defend the defenseless woman, right?
[03:40:37.663 --> 03:40:39.505]  Yeah, it's terribly perverse.
[03:40:39.625 --> 03:40:42.507]  I mean, they did not focus on the victim at all.
[03:40:42.547 --> 03:40:45.129]  These people call themselves women's rights activists.
[03:40:45.609 --> 03:40:52.972]  And they didn't focus on the women, they just used the events to advertise some political point about how Sweden is racist or something.
[03:40:53.452 --> 03:41:01.156]  One of the spokespersons for the Feminist Party said something along the lines that this isn't an issue of immigration or culture.
[03:41:01.776 --> 03:41:10.520]  The problem is the destructive male norm and the perspective that Swedish men need to protect Swedish women is part of the problem.
[03:41:10.980 --> 03:41:12.941]  The problem that creates rape, so to speak.
[03:41:15.118 --> 03:41:22.663]  This is what we saw in Norway as well, because of course they haven't had anything like the same level of problems, but again there was problems with migrants raping women.
[03:41:22.983 --> 03:41:26.706]  They came out and blamed it on Nordic drinking culture.
[03:41:28.687 --> 03:41:35.192]  It's all about men, it's not about a belief system where they literally have a game called the rape game.
[03:41:35.992 --> 03:41:40.655]  I would argue that that was the problem, not the gender of the people carrying this out, right?
[03:41:41.816 --> 03:41:50.719]  Well yeah, I mean, Norway did something great when they introduced basically consent classes for everyone who's a newly arrived immigrant.
[03:41:51.299 --> 03:41:55.720]  It's not a perfect solution, it doesn't fix everything, but it's sure a step in the right direction.
[03:41:55.780 --> 03:42:01.362]  Whereas in Sweden, such a suggestion is... to even suggest it is racist.
[03:42:01.842 --> 03:42:02.402]  It's ridiculous.
[03:42:03.885 --> 03:42:12.870]  Now, again, the stats that we last had, and I think this was from 2014, rapes have skyrocketed by 1400% since the mid-70s.
[03:42:13.251 --> 03:42:16.232]  And again, the left tries to say, oh, well, they changed the definition.
[03:42:16.693 --> 03:42:17.213]  Well, fine.
[03:42:17.253 --> 03:42:18.694]  But still, there's a massive problem.
[03:42:19.014 --> 03:42:22.656]  They've got the second highest number of rapes in the world after Lesotho.
[03:42:25.458 --> 03:42:27.839]  77.6% of the country's rapists are identified as foreigners.
[03:42:28.160 --> 03:42:31.502]  That number's probably higher now, given the influx over the last two years.
[03:42:32.082 --> 03:42:33.863]  I mean, this is clearly a problem, right?
[03:42:33.944 --> 03:42:39.568]  I mean, how can they deny that this is a problem when we see these stories every single week?
[03:42:39.988 --> 03:42:42.470]  And again, you talk about the music festivals.
[03:42:42.971 --> 03:42:51.958]  That came out that the police, they admitted they were covering that up so as not to give a boost to the Sweden Democrats, which is the anti-immigration party.
[03:42:52.358 --> 03:42:54.520]  So there's clearly a political objective
[03:42:55.020 --> 03:43:00.383]  Not only to cover up the terror attacks, the low-level intensity violence, the firebombings, but these rapes.
[03:43:00.823 --> 03:43:06.687]  Because again, the political establishment doesn't want Sweden Democrats to use this to get ahead in the polls.
[03:43:08.268 --> 03:43:09.008]  Yes, exactly.
[03:43:09.268 --> 03:43:24.157]  And the thing is that, I don't recognize the 77% number, so I'm not sure about that, but the thing is, Sweden doesn't actually carry out any statistics or research on perpetrator ethnicity anymore.
[03:43:24.517 --> 03:43:30.620]  They did back in 2005, I believe, was the last time, and what they found was an over-representation.
[03:43:31.281 --> 03:43:43.948]  And what I found, come across myself from various articles and statistics, I mean, there was one, the biggest prison in Sweden for rapists, half of the perpetrators couldn't go through treatment because they needed interpreters.
[03:43:44.688 --> 03:43:47.329]  So obviously there's a big over-representation.
[03:43:47.389 --> 03:43:48.449]  It's a big problem.
[03:43:48.649 --> 03:43:58.533]  And I'm sure that, you know, people feel more comfortable to press charges nowadays and the definition changing plays a role, but we cannot dismiss the role of immigration as well.
[03:43:58.693 --> 03:44:02.294]  So I feel like there's not much nuance to the debate here.
[03:44:04.181 --> 03:44:06.282]  Now, let me read this out of the Express.
[03:44:06.322 --> 03:44:11.243]  They reported, when this first cropped up about six, eight months ago, people again thought it was a hoax.
[03:44:11.263 --> 03:44:12.403]  They thought it was a fake story.
[03:44:13.123 --> 03:44:23.066]  Lund County in South Sweden is now considering giving jihadi defectors, that's ISIS fighters, incentives to reintegrate into society.
[03:44:23.446 --> 03:44:28.808]  The mooted benefits or housing grants help to re-enter the workforce and free driving licenses.
[03:44:29.148 --> 03:44:33.269]  So you've got actual jihadists, ISIS fighters coming back from Iraq and Syria
[03:44:33.729 --> 03:44:37.512]  They're not turning them away at the border when they try to re-enter Sweden.
[03:44:37.832 --> 03:44:40.154]  If they do enter Sweden, they're not deporting them.
[03:44:41.315 --> 03:44:46.460]  They're giving them benefits and driving licenses and trying to reintegrate them into the workforce.
[03:44:46.860 --> 03:44:55.347]  I mean, at what point does al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, just, you know, get on a plane to Sweden and declare it an ISIS caliphate?
[03:44:55.787 --> 03:44:57.669]  I mean, would he be welcomed at this point?
[03:44:58.820 --> 03:45:05.465]  Well, I mean, yeah, it's crazy because they wouldn't do this with Nazis during the Second World War.
[03:45:05.485 --> 03:45:07.446]  They wouldn't do this with SS soldiers.
[03:45:07.706 --> 03:45:13.551]  It's crazy how just because these people are immigrants or Muslims, then we're supposed to pamper them.
[03:45:14.171 --> 03:45:16.333]  And this isn't anything new, actually.
[03:45:16.373 --> 03:45:22.577]  I mean, this story broke out recently, but I remember about six months ago, Stockholm suggested the same thing.
[03:45:23.058 --> 03:45:25.940]  And before that, Örebro suggested the same thing.
[03:45:26.720 --> 03:45:36.864]  I don't know if they're actually doing it, it's a suggestion, but I do know that one town actually had a jihadist having an internship at some place.
[03:45:37.505 --> 03:45:45.128]  So it wouldn't surprise me if it were to be put into effect, because, well, nothing surprises me at this point, to be honest.
[03:45:46.474 --> 03:45:52.136]  I mean, I wrote a story about, I think it was a year ago, a Swedish immigration officer exposed as a jihadist sympathizer.
[03:45:52.396 --> 03:45:57.138]  This was somebody actually within the government liking ISIS posts on Facebook.
[03:45:57.438 --> 03:46:01.899]  You had Sweden's top Islamophobia expert go and join ISIS.
[03:46:02.039 --> 03:46:03.980]  So you've got even people within the government now.
[03:46:04.340 --> 03:46:14.443]  But again, the point we emphasize over and over, and this is what interests me, there was a video that came out of Germany last week, where they spoke to immigrants who had been there, you know, for 20, 30, 40 years.
[03:46:16.144 --> 03:46:28.128]  And they said, and this is what I hear from everyone, including in France, where my mum teaches English and speaks to a lot of people who say the same thing, this is a new breed of migrants unlike anything before.
[03:46:28.589 --> 03:46:38.452]  So these German migrants were on tape, and yeah, we've always had immigration, and sometimes they don't integrate, but normally in the past they would keep themselves to themselves, it wouldn't be a huge problem.
[03:46:38.812 --> 03:46:42.574]  But they were on tape saying, since these new migrants have come into Germany,
[03:46:43.374 --> 03:46:48.197]  These migrants who have been there for 20, 30, 40 years, they have food stores, they have businesses.
[03:46:48.237 --> 03:46:50.919]  They're saying, we just don't sell anything anymore.
[03:46:51.179 --> 03:46:52.339]  They don't buy from us.
[03:46:52.660 --> 03:46:54.541]  They bring in their own alien culture.
[03:46:54.861 --> 03:46:55.861]  We've integrated.
[03:46:56.202 --> 03:46:57.222]  They don't integrate.
[03:46:57.262 --> 03:47:02.746]  And it was the long-term immigrants in Germany that were calling for them all to be deported.
[03:47:03.126 --> 03:47:04.827]  So again, that nuance is there, isn't it?
[03:47:04.867 --> 03:47:09.029]  This is a new breed that's unlike anything we've seen in the past 30, 40 years in Europe.
[03:47:10.919 --> 03:47:11.519]  Well, exactly.
[03:47:11.559 --> 03:47:14.480]  I mean, I've seen immigrants become very, very worried.
[03:47:15.361 --> 03:47:21.563]  They live in the ghettos, and they notice that the radicalization has become far worse the past 20 years or so.
[03:47:22.344 --> 03:47:27.066]  And I think a big issue here is, which isn't talked about a lot, is Saudi Arabia.
[03:47:27.226 --> 03:47:36.009]  I mean, they're funding the building of mosques all over the world, and then they send their preachers there to preach Wahhabism, which is the most radical interpretation of Islam.
[03:47:36.049 --> 03:47:39.631]  They're basically sending preachers all over the world to radicalize the Muslim population.
[03:47:40.211 --> 03:47:42.332]  And this is never talked about, really.
[03:47:42.852 --> 03:47:45.093]  So you need to look at that there, too.
[03:47:47.074 --> 03:47:53.558]  Now, I mean, we heard about this proposal back at the beginning of the year to deport 80,000 failed asylum seekers.
[03:47:53.898 --> 03:47:56.939]  You know, you've got the Swedish Democrats rising in popularity.
[03:47:57.439 --> 03:48:08.645]  Has that process of deportation actually been happening, and do you see any kind of solution in the Sweden Democrats as a way of rolling back some of these policies that have caused this mass uncontrolled immigration?
[03:48:10.219 --> 03:48:15.582]  Well, last I checked, it's basically not possible.
[03:48:15.602 --> 03:48:22.386]  I mean, 50,000 migrants, I believe, or maybe it was 80,000, were rejected, got their asylum application rejected.
[03:48:22.946 --> 03:48:26.468]  And only a portion, a small portion of these were successfully deported.
[03:48:26.488 --> 03:48:28.169]  I mean, most of these people go underground.
[03:48:28.769 --> 03:48:33.992]  And some of them, if they are deported, they just catch a train ticket and go right back to Sweden.
[03:48:34.132 --> 03:48:38.655]  So, I mean, it costs a lot of money and it doesn't have much effect.
[03:48:39.255 --> 03:48:42.877]  When it comes to Sweden Democrats, they have, in a sense, changed.
[03:48:43.097 --> 03:48:49.040]  I mean, they're not an accepted party, they're the third biggest party, but nobody wants to negotiate with them.
[03:48:49.460 --> 03:48:58.005]  But we can see this over time, that they have made predictions that turned out to be true, and ideas that they suggested are now basically implemented.
[03:48:58.385 --> 03:49:07.490]  I mean, Sweden is now finally considering doing age tests of refugee children, who often, I mean, most of these guys look like they're 25, 30, 40.
[03:49:08.170 --> 03:49:10.912]  So there's a big scam going on here.
[03:49:11.972 --> 03:49:18.836]  And recently we implemented border controls, which severely reduced the levels of immigration.
[03:49:18.896 --> 03:49:26.060]  So, you know, even though people don't want to admit it, the Sweden Democrats have changed politics.
[03:49:27.864 --> 03:49:30.405]  And again, that's where that pressure is needed.
[03:49:30.465 --> 03:49:40.030]  If you get an increasing number of the population at least just signalling their support for the Sweden Democrats, then again, it can cause the controlling parties to change their behaviour.
[03:49:40.310 --> 03:49:52.437]  Of course, you had Merkel come out a few days ago and say that singing Christmas carols would be a good way to reassert Christianity in Germany after what she's done in importing, you know, this Islamic wave.
[03:49:53.197 --> 03:49:58.823]  I mean the fact is Hillary Clinton wants to import 65,000 quote migrants or refugees.
[03:49:59.123 --> 03:50:09.274]  That's just the starting number and you know we're being told by the media in fact you had ads in Sweden where it was like a woman in a hijab saying this is the new reality.
[03:50:09.654 --> 03:50:12.718]  Sweden is now a safe refuge for migrants.
[03:50:13.078 --> 03:50:18.143]  So they were basically saying Sweden is no longer an individual country with its own identity.
[03:50:18.584 --> 03:50:19.925]  It's just a refuge.
[03:50:20.226 --> 03:50:26.572]  It's basically a giant migrant camp for these, quote, refugees, many of whom aren't even refugees.
[03:50:26.912 --> 03:50:30.837]  How do you think Swedes feel about that when they see those kind of ads on television?
[03:50:32.045 --> 03:50:39.249]  Well, most Swedish people actually, even though they don't express it, they do believe in common sense.
[03:50:39.349 --> 03:50:41.270]  They do believe that Sweden should be Swedish.
[03:50:41.550 --> 03:50:44.072]  They do believe in the concept of when in Rome.
[03:50:44.552 --> 03:50:49.695]  I mean, Swedish people wouldn't move to Saudi Arabia and demand that they legalize porn and alcohol.
[03:50:49.795 --> 03:50:58.260]  So, I mean, I don't buy that multiculturalism is... I mean, our politicians and journalists try to push it on the population, but I don't think that the population wants that.
[03:50:58.680 --> 03:50:59.361]  I think they want...
[03:51:00.121 --> 03:51:02.843]  Their culture to be their culture.
[03:51:03.023 --> 03:51:08.166]  We'll be right back with the final segment of the Alex Jones Show and the Angry Foreigner.
[03:51:08.186 --> 03:51:08.746]  Stay tuned.
[03:51:08.806 --> 03:51:09.286]  We'll be back.
[03:51:09.727 --> 03:51:19.092]  There's a real anti-feeling globally right now against this whole idea of a world government, no accountability, and the British led the way on that.
[03:51:19.112 --> 03:51:28.077]  General Dunbar being the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, we have to understand a no-fly zone at this point in time would do nothing to help secure the situation and would likely lead to another war.
[03:51:28.257 --> 03:51:28.878]  Our largest
[03:51:29.418 --> 03:51:34.160]  The biggest threat right now globally is not Islamic terror, it's actually the Russians.
[03:51:34.240 --> 03:51:37.581]  No one has a plan for Syria and the plans that have been put forth by Ms.
[03:51:37.601 --> 03:51:44.064]  Clinton on her side are really dangerous and really designed to do damage to our national security.
[03:51:44.824 --> 03:51:52.327]  She wants to continue this unabated import of Islamist terror like they did in Germany and France.
[03:51:52.627 --> 03:51:56.768]  And that policy is not only dangerous, it is guaranteed to see more U.S.
[03:51:56.788 --> 03:51:57.669]  citizens die.
[03:51:59.029 --> 03:52:01.112]  What's happened in Europe and that would come here.
[03:52:01.353 --> 03:52:04.817]  She wants to knowingly import the problems we have in Europe.
[03:52:04.877 --> 03:52:11.747]  And the reason you would do that is because you can both be the provider of the crisis and the provider of the solution to the crisis.
[03:52:11.807 --> 03:52:14.671]  Of course, their solution, Alex, as you know, is more control.
[03:52:15.612 --> 03:52:16.453]  I don't think so.
[03:52:33.910 --> 03:52:36.191]  And look, I'm a political scientist.
[03:52:36.251 --> 03:52:37.492]  I know exactly what they're trying to do.
[03:52:37.932 --> 03:52:42.695]  They're trying to create adverse circumstances that they then can come in and solve.
[03:52:42.715 --> 03:52:48.438]  This is a global version of the Munchausen by proxy treatment of psychosis.
[03:52:48.838 --> 03:52:54.461]  So basically, she's trying to basically be, you know, be the parent who injures their own child for purposes of going in to be the hero.
[03:52:54.782 --> 03:52:57.103]  That's what they're doing, except their purpose long-term, Alex,
[03:52:57.643 --> 03:52:58.364]  We're good to go.
[03:53:19.563 --> 03:53:26.930]  That no matter how you feel about Trump, and you know, he's gone back and forth on some issues, I sincerely believe that Ms.
[03:53:26.950 --> 03:53:38.880]  Clinton will do exactly what she said regarding open borders, regarding attempting to gain control and prevent normal, you know, legitimate citizens having legitimate rights to have weapons from having them.
[03:53:38.980 --> 03:53:40.241]  And there's nothing else I agree with Ms.
[03:53:40.281 --> 03:53:40.782]  Trump on.
[03:53:41.102 --> 03:53:42.103]  If you look at her record,
[03:53:42.863 --> 03:53:45.664]  Uh, you know, you look at her 30 years of service, yeah, all of it's bad.
[03:53:45.724 --> 03:53:46.705]  All of it's failure.
[03:53:47.145 --> 03:53:53.848]  And I don't think anybody can look at her record and actually find something that's been successful for the American people.
[03:53:54.328 --> 03:54:00.691]  And the only thing she's done, Alex, if you look at it, she's created havoc and chaos in every possible way.
[03:54:00.731 --> 03:54:01.992]  For her own gain.
[03:54:02.232 --> 03:54:02.432]  Right.
[03:54:02.752 --> 03:54:05.593]  So, for personal gain, which is very clearly they have.
[03:54:05.633 --> 03:54:08.094]  So you have to ask yourself, who is Ms.
[03:54:08.134 --> 03:54:09.535]  Clinton really trying to help?
[03:54:14.104 --> 03:54:15.826]  Congratulations, lots of fun.
[03:54:16.786 --> 03:54:21.409]  You're gonna have to brush up on your negotiation ability, believe me.
[03:54:22.250 --> 03:54:37.159]  Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is the craziest thing in the world, where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half, and then he was forced to take it back the following day because that night he suffered greatly.
[03:54:37.179 --> 03:54:37.840]  Alright.
[03:54:37.860 --> 03:54:38.360]  He suffered.
[03:54:39.681 --> 03:54:42.583]  Because Hillary Clinton... There's only one thing.
[03:54:44.224 --> 03:54:51.529]  There's only one thing better than Alex Jones standing in front of George Washington, and that's Donald Trump wearing a camo hat with a suit on.
[03:54:52.189 --> 03:54:55.411]  Again, I'm not gay or anything, but this looks super Americana.
[03:54:55.852 --> 03:54:56.572]  I really like this.
[03:54:56.592 --> 03:55:09.260]  If you're not a radio listener, Infowars.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.
[03:55:14.622 --> 03:55:19.586]  Okay, we're back with the angry foreigner who is a Bosnian immigrant living in Sweden.
[03:55:20.227 --> 03:55:22.529]  Again, final comments on this situation.
[03:55:22.589 --> 03:55:26.052]  Again, we've got them banning Christmas lights now.
[03:55:26.092 --> 03:55:28.614]  They say it's for security purposes.
[03:55:28.674 --> 03:55:33.038]  I'm sure it has nothing whatsoever to do with avoiding offending Muslims.
[03:55:33.058 --> 03:55:33.398]  We've got
[03:55:33.738 --> 03:55:38.885]  Murders skyrocketing, rapes on a regular basis, cars businesses being firebombed.
[03:55:39.265 --> 03:55:45.133]  This is the European socialism that Barack Obama endorsed that Hillary Clinton wants to continue.
[03:55:45.653 --> 03:55:51.080]  The Angry Foreigner, just final comments here and tell people how they can find your YouTube channel and your Twitter.
[03:55:52.403 --> 03:55:57.224]  Well, first of all, 70% of the Swedish population want to decrease immigration.
[03:55:57.464 --> 03:55:58.465]  So people are fed up.
[03:55:58.805 --> 03:56:01.785]  And what you're seeing with the politicians and the journalists doesn't reflect the people.
[03:56:01.845 --> 03:56:03.726]  They don't represent the people anymore.
[03:56:03.826 --> 03:56:11.708]  And I'm actually hopeful for Sweden's future because we're seeing a growing resistance and we're seeing people getting sick of the racist label and more willing to speak up.
[03:56:12.068 --> 03:56:12.948]  So I'm actually hopeful.
[03:56:13.549 --> 03:56:18.770]  And if you want to check out my channel, just search Angry Foreigner and you'll come straight to my videos.
[03:56:20.453 --> 03:56:23.095]  Okay, there goes the angry foreigner.
[03:56:23.135 --> 03:56:23.995]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:56:24.035 --> 03:56:25.976]  And again, check out his video on the woman raped.
[03:56:26.516 --> 03:56:28.758]  The wheelchair woman raped by migrants.
[03:56:28.778 --> 03:56:29.878]  That went up yesterday.
[03:56:30.258 --> 03:56:32.440]  Check out his other videos about Sweden.
[03:56:32.500 --> 03:56:35.021]  Welcome to Sweden was the big viral hit.
[03:56:35.441 --> 03:56:38.503]  So definitely go and check out the angry foreigner on YouTube.
[03:56:38.883 --> 03:56:41.485]  Final couple of minutes here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:56:41.505 --> 03:56:42.705]  We're going to get into some final news.
[03:56:43.125 --> 03:56:45.727]  I was talking again earlier about that study.
[03:56:45.987 --> 03:56:47.448]  This is an MRC study.
[03:56:47.568 --> 03:56:50.630]  They took ABC, CBS, NBC evening news.
[03:56:51.110 --> 03:56:57.114]  They counted the minutes of their coverage split between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
[03:56:57.494 --> 03:57:03.137]  They found that personal controversies involving Trump covered 440 minutes.
[03:57:03.197 --> 03:57:08.000]  Again, this is the evening news between 29th of July and October 20.
[03:57:08.040 --> 03:57:13.324]  440 minutes on Trump controversies compared to only 185 on Clinton.
[03:57:13.604 --> 03:57:15.265]  So again, it was more than double for Trump.
[03:57:15.825 --> 03:57:24.269]  Trump's treatment of women was given more time by news networks than Hillary's pay-for-play scandal and email scandal combined.
[03:57:24.809 --> 03:57:31.412]  So those two Hillary scandals combined still got less air coverage compared to Trump's so-called treatment of women.
[03:57:32.092 --> 03:57:43.438]  Out of 569 such statements about the health or prospects of Trump's campaign, so how well his campaign was doing, 85% were negative compared to just
[03:57:44.738 --> 03:57:47.579]  38% that were negative for Hillary Clinton.
[03:57:47.959 --> 03:57:52.661]  So again, they're not talking about the O'Keefe videos, they're not talking about the WikiLeaks releases.
[03:57:53.161 --> 03:58:00.204]  You have Barack Obama saying that Donald Trump is whining about the election being rigged, about the media being rigged.
[03:58:00.584 --> 03:58:03.665]  These facts prove him right.
[03:58:03.986 --> 03:58:07.387]  It's not whining, it's statistics, it's documented right here.
[03:58:07.947 --> 03:58:09.888]  Basket of deplorables, Hillary Clinton.
[03:58:10.168 --> 03:58:12.449]  Got just seven minutes of total coverage.
[03:58:13.129 --> 03:58:19.490]  Compared to Trump's tax returns, which got 33 minutes of total coverage on these evening news networks.
[03:58:19.890 --> 03:58:21.030]  The verdict is in.
[03:58:21.390 --> 03:58:23.171]  The media is completely rigged.
[03:58:23.611 --> 03:58:24.171]  But still.
[03:58:25.111 --> 03:58:31.792]  They did a poll afterwards which found that 55% thought the media's coverage had been biased against Trump.
[03:58:32.212 --> 03:58:33.653]  That should be way more.
[03:58:34.033 --> 03:58:34.793]  This is clear.
[03:58:35.133 --> 03:58:36.573]  The election's being rigged.
[03:58:36.913 --> 03:58:38.954]  The media is most definitely rigged.
[03:58:39.234 --> 03:58:40.934]  The WikiLeaks emails have proven it.
[03:58:41.394 --> 03:58:45.298]  And now, how will the American people react on November 8th?
[03:58:45.398 --> 03:58:48.861]  This is the Alex Jones Show, breaking news at Infowars.com.
[03:58:50.222 --> 03:58:51.544]  You are listening to GCN.
[03:58:51.604 --> 03:58:54.847]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:59.605 --> 03:59:03.629]  Hey there, this is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com with a fun and exciting report by The Sun.
[03:59:03.709 --> 03:59:05.331]  He virtually rubbed my crotch.
[03:59:05.391 --> 03:59:08.014]  Woman sexually assaulted in virtual reality.
[03:59:08.094 --> 03:59:12.278]  The VR version was trying out the new technology for the first time with a game called
