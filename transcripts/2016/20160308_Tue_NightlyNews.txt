[00:00:19.608 --> 00:00:21.712]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:25.378]  It is Tuesday, March 8th, 2016 and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:26.640]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:41.365]  Tonight, the technological and government elite have had just about enough of Donald Trump, and they're privately meeting to come up with a plan to take him down.
[00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:53.512]  Then, more threats from North Korea, as Kim Jong Un now says his response to joint U.S.-South Korea exercises will be preemptive nuclear strikes.
[00:00:54.332 --> 00:00:58.154]  And it is now considered racist to raise your right hand.
[00:00:58.614 --> 00:01:01.115]  Well, that's if you're attending a Trump rally.
[00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:07.817]  That evokes images of Nazi Germany and the scapegoating of Jews there.
[00:01:08.078 --> 00:01:15.701]  According to the mainstream news media, Americans who pledge their support for Donald Trump resemble a Nazi salute.
[00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:17.061]  Really?
[00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:21.483]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:10.261]  Well, earlier today we learned from prosecutors that the shooting death of LaVoy Finnegan was ruled justified.
[00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:19.103]  They say that the state law allows for the use of deadly force when officers believe that someone is going to be an imminent threat to themselves or someone else.
[00:03:19.503 --> 00:03:29.326]  Well, now we have some cell phone video from inside of the vehicle that has surfaced just a mere hours after this decision was made public.
[00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:33.147]  And of course, now they're saying the FBI agents are under investigation.
[00:03:33.587 --> 00:03:35.848]  We're going to be playing that video coming up later in the show.
[00:03:35.888 --> 00:03:38.289]  We'll get David Knight and Joe Biggs response.
[00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.990]  It is shocking footage.
[00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.253]  It might have some dire implications for that decision on those FBI agents.
[00:03:46.654 --> 00:03:47.574]  So stick around for that.
[00:03:47.934 --> 00:03:52.336]  Now, we know that there are four states today who are working on their primaries.
[00:03:52.396 --> 00:03:54.217]  Who will they choose to be their candidate?
[00:03:54.638 --> 00:03:59.140]  And of course, in most of those states, Trump has the lead, but it's a very
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.280]  Small lead.
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.741]  And of course, this is following this concerted effort by the establishment to take out Trump.
[00:04:07.362 --> 00:04:24.145]  Now, we also are learning that there are technology leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook and other government insiders who met over the weekend at the American Enterprise Institute's annual World Forum, which is held at Sea Island in Georgia.
[00:04:24.725 --> 00:04:29.608]  They met there to plot the downfall of the Republican presidential candidate.
[00:04:30.028 --> 00:04:43.135]  So in addition to Cook, there was also Google founder Larry Page, Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk, the Napster creator was there, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a number of other Republican senators.
[00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:49.238]  So all of these people were meeting to figure out how to take out Donald Trump.
[00:04:49.538 --> 00:04:51.079]  Now why are they doing this?
[00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:56.741]  Now they've got so many other opportunities that they're saying that they're going to be using.
[00:04:56.761 --> 00:05:01.362]  They say the neocons and Republicans opposed to them could be forming a third party.
[00:05:02.363 --> 00:05:12.846]  Republican leaders have discussed the possibility of changing RNC rules to unbind delegates at the convention before the first round of balloting in order to undermine Trump.
[00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:15.927]  Others have mulled the idea of launching a negative
[00:05:16.067 --> 00:05:16.427]  I think so.
[00:05:38.556 --> 00:05:45.018]  And we've seen the gist of these negative ads with now everywhere Trump is Hitler.
[00:05:45.359 --> 00:05:46.399]  And so this is what we're seeing.
[00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:52.121]  There's this picture going around where you see everyone raising their hands at one of these Trump rallies.
[00:05:52.601 --> 00:06:00.384]  And Donald Trump was asking everyone to raise their hands if they pledge that they're going to vote for Donald Trump coming up in the election.
[00:06:00.424 --> 00:06:01.765]  Of course, they all raise their hands.
[00:06:02.205 --> 00:06:07.567]  And so now it's now all of a sudden that they're imitating the Heil Hitler type salutes.
[00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:16.157]  And actually, Ted Cruz came out earlier today and said, well it's just crazy that people would pledge allegiance to a candidate.
[00:06:16.398 --> 00:06:18.961]  You're supposed to pledge to the flag or pledge to your country.
[00:06:19.382 --> 00:06:23.387]  Meanwhile, it's the GOP establishment that made everyone on the stage
[00:06:23.787 --> 00:06:28.732]  Take the pledge that they would support the candidate, whoever was chosen, and they wouldn't run a third party.
[00:06:29.112 --> 00:06:31.214]  So they actually had to sign a pledge.
[00:06:31.514 --> 00:06:33.356]  So that doesn't make a whole lot of sense there.
[00:06:33.836 --> 00:06:43.225]  But the fact is, it's the GOP establishment that's being very fascist-like in trying to put the boot down on anyone who would dare challenge the authority of the state.
[00:06:45.046 --> 00:06:52.331]  Now we have Fox News' Brett Baier coming out saying some Republicans are saying that they're going to back Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.
[00:06:53.092 --> 00:06:54.953]  They don't want him to take over the party.
[00:06:55.013 --> 00:06:59.957]  So that just lets you know how against this whole thing they are.
[00:07:00.797 --> 00:07:05.561]  And I've already said they're definitely going to do something pretty big to stop Trump.
[00:07:06.142 --> 00:07:14.969]  And we know that there is going to be a revolt if they steal the election there and use their delegates to take away the votes of the American people.
[00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.612]  I think a lot of people are going to see right through that and be very upset.
[00:07:18.953 --> 00:07:27.140]  So either A, that's why they're getting all that riot gear for the convention that's coming up, or something else really catastrophic is in the works.
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.202]  And this is what Michael Snyder is actually proposing there over at his blog.
[00:07:31.603 --> 00:07:38.207]  He's saying, you know, late in his second term, Obama is really starting to become extremely aggressive with the rest of the world.
[00:07:38.887 --> 00:07:40.968]  Is Barack Obama trying to start a war?
[00:07:40.988 --> 00:07:45.851]  And will that be used as an excuse to stay in office once his term is over?
[00:07:45.911 --> 00:07:49.494]  Now I know we've talked about this a lot before with other presidents and
[00:07:50.795 --> 00:07:57.280]  Larry Nichols actually said the Clintons know that whichever president is in office when a war starts, they'll get to stay.
[00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:01.064]  So honestly, I think Obama is ready to get the heck out of there.
[00:08:01.104 --> 00:08:03.986]  He wants to go work for SportsCenter or ESPN.
[00:08:04.407 --> 00:08:07.990]  But just take a look at some of the things that have been going on in just the last few months.
[00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:14.877]  He's angered China by sailing an aircraft carrier task force past these disputed islands in the South China Sea.
[00:08:15.258 --> 00:08:22.987]  He's provoking North Korea by simulating an invasion of that nation during a military exercise that's going to involve more than 300,000 troops.
[00:08:24.929 --> 00:08:30.997]  He's backing Saudi Arabia and Turkey as they're making moves that could very well start World War III in the Middle East.
[00:08:31.578 --> 00:08:43.273]  And of course, if that did happen, it would give Obama the excuse that he needs to exercise his emergency powers, which could potentially suspend the election that's scheduled for November.
[00:08:43.874 --> 00:09:13.096]  Now, I wouldn't put it past the powers that be to pull something crazy like this, you know, but at the very least, if the Democratic candidate ends up being someone like Bernie Sanders, they have to be able to justify the need for the military-industrial complex, as well as they are going to have to be able to subdue the masses who are really upset about the fact that they're seeing behind the curtain and seeing how the presidential candidates are really chosen, because it's not your vote that matters if you vote for someone that the establishment
[00:09:13.416 --> 00:09:14.177]  Does not want.
[00:09:33.232 --> 00:09:45.619]  And the state media there announced that short, medium, and long-range precision-guided missiles were fired from several sites to show the country's all-out readiness to confront threats against its territorial integrity.
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:46.840]  So the U.S.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:10:01.189]  hit Iran with fresh sanctions on its missile program in January, just 24 hours after they lifted some different sanctions that were related to Tehran's nuclear activities under this landmark deal with the world powers.
[00:10:01.929 --> 00:10:04.430]  But this deal sounds really familiar.
[00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:09.051]  What a flashback to Clinton's nuclear deal with North Korea.
[00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:12.952]  North Korea will freeze and then dismantle its nuclear program.
[00:10:13.633 --> 00:10:16.934]  South Korea and our other allies will be better protected.
[00:10:17.554 --> 00:10:21.755]  The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons.
[00:10:22.715 --> 00:10:31.138]  South Korea, with support from Japan and other nations, will bear most of the cost of providing North Korea with fuel to make up for the nuclear energy it is losing.
[00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:40.543]  And they will pay for an alternative power system for North Korea that will allow them to produce electricity while making it much harder for them to produce nuclear weapons.
[00:10:41.384 --> 00:10:47.747]  The United States and international inspectors will carefully monitor North Korea to make sure it keeps its commitments.
[00:10:48.608 --> 00:10:53.571]  Only as it does so will North Korea fully join the community of nations.
[00:10:54.761 --> 00:10:58.324]  Seems like the new deal is very much like the old deal.
[00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:00.785]  Why are we negotiating with these rogue nations?
[00:11:01.166 --> 00:11:06.890]  Now Iran, just like North Korea, is threatening to walk away from the nuke deal after their new missile test.
[00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:17.478]  The Iranian leaders say that they are poised to walk away from the deal if the United States and other global powers fail to advance the Islamic Republic's national interests.
[00:11:17.938 --> 00:11:20.861]  They say if our interests aren't met under this nuclear deal, what's the point?
[00:11:20.881 --> 00:11:22.583]  There'll be no reason for us to continue.
[00:11:23.243 --> 00:11:24.265]  So, here we go.
[00:11:24.305 --> 00:11:27.348]  This is why you don't negotiate with rogue nations.
[00:11:28.888 --> 00:11:33.991]  Tensions between North Korea and the Western world are escalating once again.
[00:11:34.272 --> 00:11:41.797]  This time, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea threatened a preemptive and offensive nuclear strike.
[00:11:42.097 --> 00:11:46.880]  This statement was made in response to joint U.S.-South Korea exercises.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.983]  Operations Key Resolve and Full Eagle have begun.
[00:11:51.303 --> 00:11:54.024]  And they will continue until April 30th.
[00:11:54.404 --> 00:12:19.090]  The state-run North Korean Central News Agency published a statement that says, As the joint military exercises to be staged by the enemies are regarded as the most undisguised nuclear war drills aimed to infringe upon the sovereignty of the DPRK, its military counteraction will be more preemptive and offensive nuclear strikes.
[00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:23.853]  Meanwhile, the White House says they are closely monitoring the situation.
[00:12:24.034 --> 00:12:37.505]  We urge North Korea to refrain from proactive actions and statements that aggravate tensions and instead focus on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments, said a senior administration official.
[00:12:37.865 --> 00:12:44.775]  Saber rattling is not uncommon for North Korea, especially around this time for annual military exercises.
[00:12:45.076 --> 00:12:53.868]  CNN's international correspondent Paula Hancock says they have threatened this before and these kinds of threats are to be expected this time of year.
[00:12:54.569 --> 00:13:02.733]  Well, Amra, I think this has certainly been expected because this is going to be the first day of those joint military drills between the US and South Korea.
[00:13:03.294 --> 00:13:06.135]  Every single year these irritate Pyongyang.
[00:13:06.155 --> 00:13:12.759]  They see them as an address rehearsal to an invasion, which is why every year we see the rhetoric increasing.
[00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:17.381]  Of course, this year it's more tense than usual because of the backdrop.
[00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:20.503]  Of course, we have the UN sanctions that were just passed last week.
[00:13:20.703 --> 00:13:25.564]  And as of now, the situation has been escalating at an alarming rate.
[00:13:25.844 --> 00:13:31.806]  In January 2016, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb.
[00:13:33.246 --> 00:13:34.186]  At 10 a.m.
[00:13:34.266 --> 00:13:40.788]  on January 6, 2016, the first hydrogen bomb test was successfully conducted.
[00:13:51.542 --> 00:13:59.208]  In February, North Korea claims to have successfully launched an Earth satellite into orbit using a long-range missile.
[00:13:59.449 --> 00:14:12.359]  Earlier this month, the UN Security Council voted to impose sanctions on North Korea, soon after a North Korean ship was impounded in the Philippines as part of these new UN sanctions.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:17.624]  Kim Jong-un responded by saying that he needs to be ready for nuclear conflict.
[00:14:17.924 --> 00:14:21.908]  Nuclear warheads need to be ready for use at any time.
[00:14:22.188 --> 00:14:24.771]  And that's a direct quote from Kim Jong-un.
[00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:25.252]  U.S.
[00:14:25.292 --> 00:14:31.017]  officials say they are considering these threats true because they cannot risk underestimating them.
[00:14:31.298 --> 00:14:32.259]  They can say that again.
[00:14:32.499 --> 00:14:36.543]  We will keep a close eye on this as the story continues to unfold.
[00:14:36.803 --> 00:14:39.967]  Stay tuned for updates at InfoWars.com.
[00:14:41.670 --> 00:15:02.621]  So what happens when you flood your country with refugees who you can't vet, and potentially some of them have fought alongside jihadi groups in Syria, and of course you tell them that they do not need to assimilate, you paint them as the victims, so they can of course play on the soft feelings of young impressionable teenagers and women and social justice warriors everywhere?
[00:15:03.661 --> 00:15:04.802]  Well, you have this next story.
[00:15:05.222 --> 00:15:13.629]  A Danish 16-year-old girl has been arrested for possessing explosives in the tiny Danish town of Kunby.
[00:15:13.709 --> 00:15:17.452]  She was planning to blow up two schools, according to prosecutors.
[00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.974]  So the girl, she was 15 when she was arrested.
[00:15:20.334 --> 00:15:30.201]  She was a recent convert to Islam, and a 24-year-old man who had fought with jihadi groups in Syria was also arrested in connection with this case.
[00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:31.923]  Now, the pair were going to use
[00:15:32.523 --> 00:15:39.488]  Acetone peroxide, which is a highly volatile chemical, which was used in the Paris terror attacks.
[00:15:40.128 --> 00:15:48.354]  So of course, you know, she was showing support for Islamic groups on her Facebook page, other terrorist groups.
[00:15:48.734 --> 00:16:00.382]  So I'm sure this really nice 24-year-old gentleman was playing on the insecurities of a 15-year-old girl and she converts to Islam and then she's going to go blow up some schools.
[00:16:00.822 --> 00:16:01.042]  Hmm.
[00:16:01.403 --> 00:16:02.744]  Very, very interesting.
[00:16:03.745 --> 00:16:08.709]  And now, Jakari Jackson with an update on some other terror activities going on around the world.
[00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:14.354]  I have some news of very unfortunate terror attacks that have plagued the world just over the past week.
[00:16:14.714 --> 00:16:20.219]  An American tourist was stabbed to death in one of three bloody terror attacks that rocked Israel Tuesday.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:26.544]  Palestinian attackers shot and stabbed a dozen policemen and civilians in separate assaults around Israel.
[00:16:27.245 --> 00:16:34.353]  Continuing near daily incidents that began in October and have left more than 200 Israelis and Palestinians dead.
[00:16:34.854 --> 00:16:35.715]  But it's not just there.
[00:16:35.755 --> 00:16:37.597]  We also see reports out of Syria.
[00:16:38.318 --> 00:16:45.106]  As many as eight rockets fired from Syrian territory controlled by the Islamic State terror group landed in Turkey on Tuesday.
[00:16:45.526 --> 00:16:48.808]  Killing two people, including a four-year-old boy, officials said.
[00:16:49.268 --> 00:16:59.714]  Which makes me wonder, if you throw back to the video of the airdrop grenades and rockets to ISIS, are some of those same armaments being used against the people in Syria now?
[00:17:00.034 --> 00:17:01.875]  The mayor of the border city of Kilis,
[00:17:02.435 --> 00:17:06.556]  Said Turkish artillery retaliated by firing at ISIS targets in Syria.
[00:17:07.017 --> 00:17:14.339]  At least one of the rockets fired from Syria hit a neighborhood in Kilis, killing a woman and injuring two boys riding inside of a car.
[00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:17.160]  But not all the attacks are perpetrated by the terrorists.
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.360]  Sometimes the terrorists themselves get struck.
[00:17:19.741 --> 00:17:21.301]  We have a report out of the Pentagon.
[00:17:21.781 --> 00:17:23.182]  The Pentagon says a U.S.
[00:17:23.222 --> 00:17:29.884]  strike on Saturday struck a training camp for fighters in Somalia who were preparing to launch a large-scale attack.
[00:17:30.464 --> 00:17:41.150]  CBS News correspondent David Martin reports that the Pentagon says the fighters were in the final stages of planning an attack against the African Union mission in Somalia, which includes U.S.
[00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.750]  personnel.
[00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.051]  So we'll keep you up to date with the latest.
[00:17:44.471 --> 00:17:45.272]  Back to you, Leanne.

[00:17:57.051 --> 00:17:59.272]  We're going to be going live at 7 p.m.
[00:17:59.452 --> 00:17:59.873]  Central.

[00:18:03.695 --> 00:18:05.356]  So be sure to join us.
[00:18:05.896 --> 00:18:06.196]  I think.
[00:18:24.005 --> 00:18:24.345]  Let's do it!
[00:19:02.702 --> 00:19:06.124]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:19:06.485 --> 00:19:13.609]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:22.575]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:19:22.815 --> 00:19:26.938]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:19:27.258 --> 00:19:32.602]  Pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:19:32.602 --> 00:19:32.862]  Let's do it!
[00:20:01.218 --> 00:20:15.429]  My fellow InfoWarriors, I am very excited to be able to announce to you the introduction at InfoWarsLife.com of a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsLife formulations like Survival Shield X2 and Super Metal Vitality.

[00:23:08.751 --> 00:23:09.712]  Okay, we're good.
[00:23:09.732 --> 00:23:11.213]  Go ahead and shoot me!
[00:23:11.233 --> 00:23:13.114]  Shoot him!
[00:23:13.234 --> 00:23:13.614]  Yeah!
[00:23:14.455 --> 00:23:15.856]  Go ahead and shoot me!
[00:23:15.916 --> 00:23:18.157]  Go ahead and shoot me!
[00:23:18.177 --> 00:23:18.537]  Stay down.
[00:23:18.577 --> 00:23:19.038]  Stay down.
[00:23:19.578 --> 00:23:20.038]  Stay down.
[00:23:20.058 --> 00:23:21.519]  Stay down.
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:22.960]  Stay down.
[00:23:25.101 --> 00:23:27.303]  Stay down.
[00:23:27.503 --> 00:23:28.143]  Are they shooting him?
[00:23:28.624 --> 00:23:29.244]  Did they shoot him?
[00:23:30.565 --> 00:23:31.445]  You a**hole.
[00:23:32.226 --> 00:23:34.327]  Oh my God!
[00:23:34.968 --> 00:23:35.368]  Stay down.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.461]  Don't get out.
[00:23:40.763 --> 00:23:43.746]  Are you hit?
[00:23:46.288 --> 00:23:46.969]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:23:46.989 --> 00:23:48.050]  Don't do anything.
[00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.592]  Don't do anything.
[00:23:50.612 --> 00:23:51.293]  The hell is the boy?
[00:23:52.239 --> 00:23:54.321]  Joe Banks here with InfoWars.com.
[00:23:54.561 --> 00:24:05.490]  Now, David and I just saw the shocking footage released by the Oregonian right after they've already come out and said that LaVoy Finnickham's murder was justified.
[00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:18.940]  Now we have raw cell phone footage from Shawna Cox inside the vehicle that proves that they were shooting at them beforehand, completely going against the actual narrative of the story that the feds came out with in the first place.
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.542]  I mean, what are your first thoughts on seeing this video?
[00:24:21.328 --> 00:24:23.329]  You know, it was really heart-wrenching to look at this.
[00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:28.811]  I gotta say, what I saw there was murder and attempted murder of three other people in the vehicle.
[00:24:29.591 --> 00:24:36.214]  You can see what's happening, and the way the video is set up, and again, it was put up on the Oregonian site, but it was released by the Sheriff's Department.
[00:24:36.274 --> 00:24:37.934]  Dushane, is that the way you pronounce it?
[00:24:38.154 --> 00:24:38.394]  Deschutes.
[00:24:38.414 --> 00:24:38.775]  Deschutes, okay.
[00:24:38.815 --> 00:24:41.196]  Deschutes County released this.
[00:24:41.216 --> 00:24:42.996]  They're the ones who are doing the investigation.
[00:24:43.416 --> 00:24:44.577]  This comes on the day
[00:24:45.157 --> 00:24:49.018]  That law enforcement has told us that the shooting of Lavoie Finnegan was justified.
[00:24:49.618 --> 00:24:51.999]  This flies in the face of that.
[00:24:52.339 --> 00:24:56.921]  This is an outrage that they would put this up there that they would say that law enforcement is justified.
[00:24:57.001 --> 00:24:59.682]  How are you justified in shooting a man with his hands up?
[00:24:59.722 --> 00:25:00.322]  And you can see
[00:25:00.802 --> 00:25:01.843]  That that's what happened here.
[00:25:02.043 --> 00:25:05.967]  You can see that they're taking pot shots for a very long time at the people who are in the car.
[00:25:06.227 --> 00:25:17.376]  And the way this video is set up, they superimpose the cell phone footage from Shawna Cox, who is in the vehicle, in the back seat with Victoria Sharpe, with Ryan Bundy, Lavoie Finnegan is driving.
[00:25:17.737 --> 00:25:20.439]  Okay, so she's taking it from the back corner, so you can see what's going on.
[00:25:20.459 --> 00:25:23.542]  They superimpose that with the footage from the FBI.
[00:25:23.562 --> 00:25:24.462]  And here's the thing, Joe.
[00:25:25.103 --> 00:25:25.583]  We're good to go.
[00:25:43.072 --> 00:25:45.975]  That was a video that mainstream media went with for a very long time.
[00:25:46.015 --> 00:25:47.396]  That was a video that everybody saw.
[00:25:47.817 --> 00:25:51.961]  Now, after they say, well, it's a justified shooting, now you can see what happens.
[00:25:52.181 --> 00:25:53.903]  You can hear when the shots are fired.
[00:25:54.103 --> 00:25:57.387]  You can see that they're shooting them as they're driving up to the barricade.
[00:25:57.607 --> 00:26:05.315]  You can see that they're shooting Lavoie Finnegan as he gets out of the car with his hands up to take fire away from the rest of the people in the vehicle.
[00:26:05.535 --> 00:26:13.381]  He was a hero to take the fire, to sacrifice himself for those people in the car, yet they still tried to shoot the people in the car.
[00:26:13.421 --> 00:26:14.221]  Totally outrageous.
[00:26:14.401 --> 00:26:17.884]  Yeah, and that kind of goes with the entire point that we were trying to make back when it happened.
[00:26:17.904 --> 00:26:19.305]  They said that he was reaching for a gun.
[00:26:19.705 --> 00:26:23.007]  In fact, you hear those shots first as the hands are going up.
[00:26:23.367 --> 00:26:26.970]  So that could possibly be him reaching in pain, going, oh my God, I just got shot.
[00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:30.312]  And then they go, and they're going in after that and continue to shoot.
[00:26:30.572 --> 00:26:34.015]  Now after LaVoy's dead laying there in the snow, they continue to shoot again.
[00:26:34.055 --> 00:26:36.857]  That's when Ryan Bundy takes a shot as well.
[00:26:36.877 --> 00:26:38.258]  And you can see the glass shatter.
[00:26:38.818 --> 00:26:44.883]  They also continue to fire what seems to be bean bag rounds to break the glass so they can then shoot in the tear gas they did.
[00:26:45.383 --> 00:26:49.926]  All you can hear is Victoria Sharpe, a very young girl, scared, crying, praying.
[00:26:49.946 --> 00:26:55.250]  You know, the entire conversation leading up to this, no one was like, I've got a gun, I'm gonna make this last stand.
[00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:56.571]  The guy just said, if you're gonna shoot me,
[00:26:57.091 --> 00:26:57.391]  Do it.
[00:26:57.552 --> 00:26:58.513]  Stop wasting my time.
[00:26:58.813 --> 00:27:01.176]  I'm trying to go meet the sheriff in Grants Pass.
[00:27:01.196 --> 00:27:01.816]  You can follow us.
[00:27:01.836 --> 00:27:02.998]  We're on our way to see the sheriff.
[00:27:03.018 --> 00:27:03.799]  You can follow us.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.602]  It's absolutely amazing, Joe.
[00:27:06.722 --> 00:27:10.906]  And again, they did this so that they could hide what they had done.
[00:27:10.947 --> 00:27:14.771]  And we've had a law enforcement officer look at this and critique what these people did.
[00:27:15.131 --> 00:27:19.754]  The two guys who came up appeared to be the ones when he was still standing.
[00:27:20.094 --> 00:27:23.597]  There were shots that were being fired at him as he got out of the vehicle with his hands up.
[00:27:23.897 --> 00:27:37.906]  Then he walks a little bit further out, and in the video that the FBI released, you can see one guy coming from where the blockade was, and he is shooting at LaVoy Finicum, and he points out this guy has exposed himself to hostile fire from the vehicle.
[00:27:38.406 --> 00:28:01.368]  If in fact there are dangerous people in there they're treating this guy as if he is a threat to their lives and yet he's coming out of a vehicle they don't know who's in this this other vehicle the vehicle that stopped but they feel that they have to shoot this guy with his hands up okay exposing himself to fire from the vehicle then they pull back and they shoot at the vehicle okay so if they were dangerous they could have killed this officer the
[00:28:01.408 --> 00:28:06.730]  The other officer who's coming from out of the snow is shooting across at the other officers.
[00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:09.631]  It's basically a crossfire that they've set themselves up in.
[00:28:09.931 --> 00:28:14.132]  So, it's amazingly incompetent if you look at it from a law enforcement perspective.
[00:28:14.672 --> 00:28:18.914]  But it is outright murder and attempted murder if you watch this video.
[00:28:18.934 --> 00:28:19.934]  It's absolutely outrageous.
[00:28:19.954 --> 00:28:20.875]  I don't know what else to say.
[00:28:20.915 --> 00:28:30.858]  I mean, it's just one of the most amazing things that I've seen to superimpose the reality of what's going on with this lying video that the FBI put out about a month ago.
[00:28:31.178 --> 00:28:33.339]  Yeah, I mean, I remember watching when it first came out.
[00:28:33.359 --> 00:28:37.962]  We were watching it live, and I said, it's so hard to tell what's going on based off the angle it is.
[00:28:37.982 --> 00:28:38.742]  There's no sound.
[00:28:39.182 --> 00:28:40.063]  Yeah, and it was intentional.
[00:28:40.083 --> 00:28:48.647]  And then when you watch the video, you can clearly see the flash bangs going off, the bullets coming, and you can hear the police firing at that vehicle with the three in the back.
[00:28:49.028 --> 00:28:53.690]  You know, Ryan's trying to protect those two women in the back, and they're laying there screaming and crying, praying.
[00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.812]  So hopefully a lot of you people are going to have a chance to watch this video
[00:28:57.412 --> 00:29:02.594]  And for once, actually see the truth of what happened in the murder of Lavoie Finnegan.
[00:29:02.914 --> 00:29:04.955]  This has been Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[00:29:13.017 --> 00:29:22.641]  I struggle to come up with words to describe the globalist social engineers' plan for humanity.
[00:29:24.361 --> 00:29:26.642]  Their entire design is the coldest,
[00:29:28.527 --> 00:29:38.920]  Most wicked, hateful plan that one could ever even imagine.
[00:29:41.003 --> 00:29:43.346]  But I think the word is truly selfishness.
[00:29:45.202 --> 00:29:55.308]  The engineers are so selfish and so greedy wanting to control reality, wanting to dominate civilization and the direction humanity goes in.
[00:29:55.708 --> 00:30:13.618]  Their lust to control free will and chart humanity's course into a technotronic hell is so complete that they are doing everything they can to isolate individuals, to destroy families, and to make sure we're all alone.
[00:30:14.437 --> 00:30:19.659]  And have no culture, have no tribe, have no people.
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:37.546]  They're attacking individual tribes, cultures, religions, and peoples and playing them off against each other and posing as the referees who will then keep all the groups from fighting while they stir up the divide and conquer Balkanization.
[00:30:39.807 --> 00:30:40.627]  But beyond that,
[00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:50.636]  They are then in the name of unity watering down all the cultures and ideas until there is no culture, there is no idea, there is no debate.
[00:30:52.757 --> 00:31:00.283]  And everybody basically wears the equivalent of 1984 gray overalls.
[00:31:01.944 --> 00:31:08.949]  When they talk about making America whole, making the world equal, they mean making us all equally
[00:31:09.978 --> 00:31:11.819]  Unconscious servile slaves.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.001]  You look at the whole push of Western psychology.
[00:31:20.941 --> 00:31:23.682]  It says you're an animal, you're programmable, you don't have free will.
[00:31:24.222 --> 00:31:35.526]  And if you believe in a great destiny for humanity, if you believe you can create great art or literature or have a great crop or make great whiskey or write a wonderful book, you're a narcissist.
[00:31:35.586 --> 00:31:36.426]  You're delusional.
[00:31:38.274 --> 00:31:51.424]  And they take the traits of innovators and then mix it in with the traits of true narcissists and egomaniacs to then demonize anyone that has the spark of Promethean flame in them that God has given us.
[00:31:52.405 --> 00:31:57.069]  Not because the engineers don't know it's real, but because they're threatened by it.
[00:31:57.409 --> 00:31:59.170]  They want to be the dream catchers.
[00:32:00.532 --> 00:32:03.714]  They want to control the dreams and steal the dreams.
[00:32:04.895 --> 00:32:07.237]  They want to live while you and I sleep.
[00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:29.260]  I was driving into work and I noticed because I was getting some gas in the access road that over off of Ben White here in Austin, Texas, what I've read about in the newspaper is ongoing for the last year or so, there are pro-lifers out protesting in front of the Planned Parenthood main center in Austin.
[00:32:30.333 --> 00:32:34.776]  Seven days a week that that death mill is doing partial birth abortions on eight and nine-month-old babies.
[00:32:35.176 --> 00:32:37.477]  And they have been harassed by the Satanists and others.
[00:32:37.497 --> 00:32:38.518]  They've been physically attacked.
[00:32:38.778 --> 00:32:39.479]  I have been attacked.
[00:32:39.959 --> 00:32:41.060]  Jakari has been attacked.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.080]  Weldon has been attacked.
[00:32:42.441 --> 00:32:44.422]  They attack people on crutches and wheelchairs.
[00:32:44.742 --> 00:32:54.388]  And when I see the type of people that show up at the Capitol and show up here to protest for death, it'd be one thing if you argued, oh, it's first trimester, oh, the woman will be too poor, whatever.
[00:32:54.668 --> 00:32:59.231]  I could see those arguments, but when you meet the pro-abortionists, they are ghouls.
[00:33:02.148 --> 00:33:03.789]  The Knowledge of the Ancients.
[00:33:04.129 --> 00:33:07.672]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:33:07.932 --> 00:33:10.554]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.

[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:47.821]  We're good.
[00:34:02.005 --> 00:34:08.207]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forklift situation?
[00:34:08.227 --> 00:34:11.527]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:34:11.547 --> 00:34:13.288]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:34:13.328 --> 00:34:19.589]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:34:19.689 --> 00:34:25.591]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:34:25.751 --> 00:34:29.514]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:34:29.694 --> 00:34:32.637]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:34:32.777 --> 00:34:40.803]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:34:41.064 --> 00:34:43.105]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:34:43.145 --> 00:34:44.286]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:34:44.566 --> 00:34:46.248]  It's more vital than ever.
[00:34:46.408 --> 00:34:46.888]  I'm good to go.

[00:37:12.082 --> 00:37:14.243]  What is hidden shall be revealed.
[00:37:14.563 --> 00:37:25.229]  Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House, recently had this to say, eliminating any doubt that we are aggressively ruled by nothing less than a global Luciferian elite.
[00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:31.632]  And now they're faced with a very real prospect of Donald Trump becoming the leader of the party and it absolutely drives them crazy.
[00:37:32.132 --> 00:37:32.292]  Why?
[00:37:32.312 --> 00:37:35.034]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.
[00:37:35.074 --> 00:37:40.477]  And we are as a people, inherently and historically, opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.
[00:37:40.497 --> 00:37:41.017]  We decided long ago
[00:38:02.364 --> 00:38:11.689]  That the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it.
[00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:20.974]  Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions.
[00:38:22.075 --> 00:38:29.779]  Even today, there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it.
[00:38:30.959 --> 00:38:44.931]  And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment.
[00:38:45.952 --> 00:38:57.282]  For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covet means for expanding its sphere of influence.
[00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:03.177]  What is at stake is more than one small country.
[00:39:04.399 --> 00:39:05.761]  It is a big idea.
[00:39:06.937 --> 00:39:07.978]  A New World Order!
[00:39:08.558 --> 00:39:11.699]  The New World Order is no longer hiding in the shadows.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:19.223]  They are utilizing their total domination of civilization to bring your morality into a new dark age.
[00:39:19.543 --> 00:39:34.791]  Whether it's the United Nations David Rockefeller Lucius Trust rollout of demoralization, courtesy of Alice Bailey's Ten Point Plan, the purpose of which is to change Christian tradition or to redeem the nations of Christian tradition.
[00:39:35.151 --> 00:39:38.575]  Number one, take God and prayer out of the education system.
[00:39:38.875 --> 00:39:41.939]  Number two, reduce parental authority over the children.
[00:39:42.259 --> 00:39:45.844]  Number three, destroy the Judeo-Christian family structure.
[00:39:46.224 --> 00:39:53.753]  Number four, cause society to reevaluate sexual freedom and reduce the population by making abortion legal.
[00:39:54.133 --> 00:39:54.914]  Number 5.
[00:39:55.294 --> 00:39:57.216]  Make divorce easy and legal.
[00:39:57.456 --> 00:40:00.339]  Free people from the concept of marriage for life.
[00:40:00.659 --> 00:40:00.939]  Number 6.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.963]  Promote homosexuality as an alternative lifestyle.
[00:40:05.263 --> 00:40:05.984]  Number 7.
[00:40:06.484 --> 00:40:10.708]  Corrupt and defile the imagination by debasing art.
[00:40:11.128 --> 00:40:11.408]  Number 8.
[00:40:12.289 --> 00:40:15.072]  Use media to brainwash the population.
[00:40:15.532 --> 00:40:15.812]  Number 9.
[00:40:16.693 --> 00:40:22.276]  Promote a new age movement to overshadow the Christian faith.
[00:40:22.596 --> 00:40:29.660]  Have governments make all of the previous points laws and have the church endorse these changes.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.161]  These points were stated over 70 years ago.
[00:40:33.502 --> 00:40:33.923]  We're good to go!
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:41:00.982]  Offering performances by Illuminati slaves akin to Kesha, for example, adorned with satanic regalia, channeling Lucifer on the Today Show, no less.
[00:41:01.362 --> 00:41:05.823]  As in the words of one of the New World Order's chief engineers, former U.S.
[00:41:05.903 --> 00:41:13.104]  National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, history is much more the product of chaos than conspiracy.
[00:41:13.485 --> 00:41:15.485]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:41:31.698 --> 00:41:33.479]  This is a protest.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.021]  And this is a riot.
[00:41:36.421 --> 00:41:40.244]  If you can't tell the difference, then you are part of the problem.
[00:41:40.644 --> 00:41:41.685]  Infowars.com.
[00:41:49.611 --> 00:42:02.237]  In 2015, the French government indicted Baron David de Rothschild for embezzling large sums of money from British pensioners from 2005 to 2008, and for the violation of inheritance tax laws.
[00:42:02.497 --> 00:42:13.122]  In June of 2015, Paris-based Judge Javier Bermudez ruled that Baron Rothschild of the Rothschild Financial Services Group must face a trial for his crimes.
[00:42:13.402 --> 00:42:17.766]  That is if they can find him in one of his many mansions scattered around France.
[00:42:18.207 --> 00:42:23.472]  Now the French government has opened another investigation into the Swiss Rothschild's unit.
[00:42:23.752 --> 00:42:32.761]  Bloomberg reports, the Swiss unit of Edmond de Rothschild said it's the subject of a French probe regarding a former business relationship.
[00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:33.601]  We're good to go!
[00:43:00.797 --> 00:43:14.650]  From a Haaretz interview six years ago, Baron Benjamin de Rothschild was quoted as saying, The Rothschild family is so wealthy, they don't regularly appear on any Forbes list of the world's wealthiest, and when they do, their true wealth is minimized.
[00:43:23.618 --> 00:43:28.502]  Their fortune would embarrassingly dwarf the multi-billions of Bill Gates or Warren Buffett.
[00:43:28.702 --> 00:43:32.745]  The Rothschild story is precariously embedded in the footnotes of world history.
[00:43:33.025 --> 00:43:37.908]  Nathan Rothschild became the largest debtor to the Bank of England until the bank was privatized in 1946.
[00:43:39.389 --> 00:43:51.318]  However, although the Bank of England is state-owned, 97% of the UK's money supply is still privately controlled in the form of interest-bearing loans created by the Rothschild-dominated commercial banks.
[00:43:51.798 --> 00:44:01.547]  The Rothschild's modern manipulation of the British economy is clearly evident in this clip demonstrating Queen Elizabeth's inquiry into the downturn of the British economy.
[00:44:02.167 --> 00:44:06.851]  And after a brief explanation, another question, this time from the Duke.
[00:44:16.653 --> 00:44:24.778]  The Queen's question was finally answered by Rothschild lackeys four years later, after the Queen personally had to visit the Bank of England to get an answer.
[00:44:24.899 --> 00:44:29.622]  The indictment of a Rothschild is not simply another dirty banker being brought to justice.
[00:44:29.922 --> 00:44:43.751]  The imprisonment of part of the controlling interest of civilization could gradually snowball, meaning a stop to endless wars, illegal mass surveillance, debt slavery, and a Luciferian cultural agenda.
[00:44:43.931 --> 00:44:45.432]  Basically, peace on Earth.
[00:44:46.613 --> 00:44:47.393]  We're good to go.
[00:45:10.305 --> 00:45:12.346]  Have you heard about this in the mainstream news?
[00:45:12.546 --> 00:45:25.832]  They either own or have compromised every US and European political puppet with an elitist passion for worshipping Lucifer and an unyielding obsession to decrease the world population by 90% by legal means.
[00:45:26.172 --> 00:45:31.094]  Means the Rothschilds are on the verge of completely acquiring via the United Nations.
[00:45:31.314 --> 00:45:49.159]  The ultimate advantage, listen to this, that the creditor has over a king or a president is that if the ruler gets out of line, the banker can finance his enemy or his rival.
[00:45:50.236 --> 00:46:09.712]  Therefore, if you want to stay in the lucrative financing business of kings and governments, it is wise to have an enemy or a rival waiting in the wings to unseat every king or every president to whom you lend money.
[00:46:10.312 --> 00:46:15.837]  If the king doesn't have an enemy, you gotta be able to create one.
[00:46:16.809 --> 00:46:18.550]  Yes, for centuries now.
[00:46:19.051 --> 00:46:36.885]  There truly has been a global New World Order shadow government family syndicate legitimizing its control over civilization, responsible for their involvement in a seemingly endless list of horrors and violations of human rights since long before any of us were even born.
[00:46:37.345 --> 00:46:47.602]  And yes, currently without as much as a peep from the mainstream media, that very family is being pursued by a French court to stand trial.
[00:46:47.862 --> 00:46:49.726]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:47:03.007 --> 00:47:04.009]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:06.833]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.114 --> 00:47:14.966]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:05.051 --> 00:49:17.701]  Well, I got to issue a little trigger warning for anybody out there who has an issue with a woman using a gun to protect herself, because now we have a story about a Kentucky woman who heroically turned the tables on a would-be attacker.
[00:49:18.041 --> 00:49:21.684]  He was trying to rob her at knife point, probably was going to try and rape her as well.
[00:49:22.104 --> 00:49:27.489]  Instead, he ended up getting shot in the neck and the butt, and she shot him with her own gun.
[00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:29.330]  So this is an unidentified woman.
[00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:33.173]  She was being stalked by John Gnobic on the night of January 26th.
[00:49:34.414 --> 00:49:38.435]  He followed her into a shopping mall elevator and then on into the parking lot.
[00:49:38.735 --> 00:49:41.496]  He exited the elevator with her, gave chase.
[00:49:42.096 --> 00:49:47.578]  She started running to her car, but he followed her, forced himself into the car with her, tried to beat her.
[00:49:47.598 --> 00:49:50.238]  The woman was fearing that she was going to get raped.
[00:49:50.919 --> 00:49:53.679]  But then she was able to get her gun that was in her purse.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.700]  She pulled out her Beretta from her handbag.
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:57.521]  She opened fire.
[00:49:57.601 --> 00:49:58.541]  She shot him in the neck.
[00:49:59.401 --> 00:50:03.745]  And he quickly regained his bearings and continued trying to attack her.
[00:50:04.046 --> 00:50:07.269]  So then she popped off a few more rounds, shot him in the butt.
[00:50:07.849 --> 00:50:11.933]  You know, but according to some of the gun grabbers out there, this lady should have just peed herself.
[00:50:12.333 --> 00:50:15.176]  She should have vomited on the guy to try and stop this attack.
[00:50:15.256 --> 00:50:18.679]  She shouldn't have been brave and a hero and shot the guy.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:20.561]  Just fended off her attacker.
[00:50:20.621 --> 00:50:24.643]  You know, then he could have just ran off into the mall and found someone else to take advantage of.
[00:50:25.203 --> 00:50:30.706]  Probably would have tried to go get stitched up at the hospital or something so he could live another day to go rape and attack another woman.
[00:50:31.306 --> 00:50:32.547]  So now he's going to jail.
[00:50:33.287 --> 00:50:39.470]  So this is also, I think it's a whole segment dedicated to you sensitivity fascists.
[00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:46.394]  Because now we have a professor coming out saying sensitivity fascists are turning colleges into daycare centers.
[00:50:47.314 --> 00:51:01.340]  We've reported on how University of Pittsburgh students were declaring themselves in danger and traumatized over a provocative campus speech by the right-wing flamethrower Breitbart's Milo Yiannopoulos.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:11.304]  They were so traumatized they demanded to know from a student government hearing why the school hadn't provided on-site therapy for those who felt invalidated by the speech.
[00:51:11.624 --> 00:51:14.445]  This was a speech that no one was forced to attend.
[00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:16.186]  The student government
[00:51:17.126 --> 00:51:22.409]  President, she broke down in tears and then she said she was so sorry she spent the money on that guest.
[00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:24.150]  And that goes on and on.
[00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:32.395]  Some other student government, they're facing impeachment after attending a tequila party where some guests wore tiny sombreros.
[00:51:32.675 --> 00:51:38.058]  So the school has launched an investigation into this act of ethnic stereotyping.
[00:51:38.698 --> 00:51:41.901]  And their partygoers are on social probation.
[00:51:42.461 --> 00:51:46.164]  And the hosts have been expelled from their dorms.
[00:51:46.565 --> 00:51:49.447]  So, this is totally counter to education.
[00:51:49.707 --> 00:51:53.671]  This is ideological fascism, all of you out there.
[00:51:54.371 --> 00:51:55.492]  And that's not it.
[00:51:55.572 --> 00:51:56.293]  It doesn't end there.
[00:51:56.733 --> 00:52:00.615]  Now, we got the Safe Space students at Western Washington University.
[00:52:01.035 --> 00:52:15.921]  They've issued an extensive list of demands, which includes the construction of an entirely new college dedicated to social justice, as well as the ability to fire police officers who commit microaggressions against them.
[00:52:16.482 --> 00:52:19.363]  So this is the Student Assembly for Power and Liberation.
[00:52:20.023 --> 00:52:34.308]  And they call for the creation and full implementation of the College of Power and Liberation, an institution that will be solely devoted to social justice and combating systemic oppression and white supremacy.
[00:52:34.748 --> 00:52:45.132]  So these sound like entitled little crybaby authoritarians who don't know jack about the real world and are going to be in for a real shock upon graduation.
[00:52:45.592 --> 00:52:54.957]  Now, our reporter Joe Biggs took to the streets to find some of these white privileged oppressors to find out if they could actually check their privilege.
[00:52:56.238 --> 00:52:58.199]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:52:58.239 --> 00:53:01.601]  Now we're in downtown Austin, Texas on 6th Street.
[00:53:02.042 --> 00:53:05.023]  Now, you've probably heard the term, white men can't jump.
[00:53:05.243 --> 00:53:05.924]  Really listen to me.
[00:53:06.724 --> 00:53:06.904]  What?
[00:53:07.745 --> 00:53:09.586]  White men can't jump.
[00:53:11.507 --> 00:53:12.087]  Oh, f**k me!
[00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:17.112]  Or the fact that white people can't dance.
[00:53:17.593 --> 00:53:20.496]  I went to a white disco recently and I watched white people dance.
[00:53:21.056 --> 00:53:22.738]  Y'all, y'all can't dance.
[00:53:27.191 --> 00:53:31.332]  Or the fact that white privilege can literally keep you from being poor.
[00:53:31.692 --> 00:53:36.133]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[00:53:36.673 --> 00:53:38.994]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:53:39.414 --> 00:53:43.015]  Now we're gonna go talk to some people and see how their white privilege is working out for them.
[00:53:43.475 --> 00:53:46.976]  Did you know that because you have white privilege, you can't be poor?
[00:53:47.016 --> 00:53:47.696]  That's what, uh...
[00:53:48.513 --> 00:53:49.534]  Bernie Sanders was saying.
[00:53:49.874 --> 00:53:52.817]  I'm sorry, he's full of s**t. I've been poor for five years of my life.
[00:53:53.597 --> 00:53:55.019]  I've been out here on the streets for five years.
[00:53:55.319 --> 00:53:57.641]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:53:58.101 --> 00:53:59.022]  S**t. I think he's wrong.
[00:53:59.042 --> 00:54:01.804]  I mean, you can be poor regardless of who you are, if you're white.
[00:54:01.904 --> 00:54:05.507]  I think that you get special privilege because you're white.
[00:54:05.527 --> 00:54:09.531]  That's some bulls**t. I mean, B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T.
[00:54:09.631 --> 00:54:13.054]  Bulls**t. Mr. Sanders should suck c**t. That's true.
[00:54:14.155 --> 00:54:15.616]  You can't be poor and be white.
[00:54:16.223 --> 00:54:18.625]  So your white privilege hasn't put a home over your head?
[00:54:19.185 --> 00:54:19.365]  No.
[00:54:19.785 --> 00:54:20.486]  I'm not lying to you.
[00:54:20.506 --> 00:54:23.108]  Mr. Obama went to his desk and looked at something and they took a picture.
[00:54:23.508 --> 00:54:24.188]  He can have it all.
[00:54:24.409 --> 00:54:25.850]  It hasn't kept you warm when it was cold?
[00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:26.330]  No.
[00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:27.931]  It hasn't kept you cold when it was hot?
[00:54:28.351 --> 00:54:28.531]  No.
[00:54:29.672 --> 00:54:30.112]  We're rich.
[00:54:30.373 --> 00:54:31.213]  That's how rich we are.
[00:54:31.413 --> 00:54:34.055]  Any office you want, any communication you want, okay?
[00:54:34.195 --> 00:54:36.156]  We built everything for everybody to get along.
[00:54:36.937 --> 00:54:40.379]  Does it automatically, like, keep water from falling and hitting you when it rains?
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:40.840]  No.
[00:54:41.735 --> 00:54:43.337]  Well, it didn't keep me dry this morning.
[00:54:43.437 --> 00:54:45.459]  It didn't keep me warm last night.
[00:54:45.559 --> 00:54:46.900]  So, we'll see what happens.
[00:54:47.241 --> 00:54:49.543]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:54:49.563 --> 00:54:50.704]  Yeah, did he say that?
[00:54:50.985 --> 00:54:51.185]  Yeah.
[00:54:51.505 --> 00:54:52.546]  Well, he must've meant that s***.
[00:54:52.586 --> 00:54:54.308]  If he said it, Bernie said that s***.
[00:54:54.328 --> 00:54:55.890]  Yeah, but do you believe that, though?
[00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:56.551]  Hell naw.
[00:54:56.911 --> 00:54:57.712]  White people f***ed up.
[00:54:57.732 --> 00:54:58.332]  We all n****s.
[00:54:59.113 --> 00:55:06.075]  Bernie Sanders is an a**hole when he throwed color into the mix because if everybody was stripped down and didn't have hair on their body, we'd all look the same.
[00:55:06.135 --> 00:55:07.876]  So Bernie Sanders can kiss my a**.
[00:55:08.336 --> 00:55:09.096]  I'm taking this button off.
[00:55:09.416 --> 00:55:11.096]  So, I'm glad y'all got this s**t on video.
[00:55:11.697 --> 00:55:12.617]  You said this s**t for show?
[00:55:12.797 --> 00:55:13.457]  Yes, on Sunday.
[00:55:13.477 --> 00:55:16.898]  F**k that s**t. That's totally wrong, yeah.
[00:55:17.238 --> 00:55:20.439]  I disagree with that, with Bernie Sanders on that one.
[00:55:20.859 --> 00:55:23.460]  They can blow their a** too and end up just where we are.
[00:55:24.136 --> 00:55:27.558]  I've been a homeless white man since I was nine years old.
[00:55:28.059 --> 00:55:28.899]  I've lived on the street.
[00:55:29.119 --> 00:55:31.441]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:55:31.781 --> 00:55:35.083]  And I support Bernie, but I really, really am offended by that statement.
[00:55:35.623 --> 00:55:36.924]  I'm very offended by that statement.
[00:55:37.225 --> 00:55:40.347]  Bernie is going to be the dude, because he came out here with the camera.
[00:55:40.367 --> 00:55:44.309]  In other words, when he went to the desk, he seen something else he wanted.
[00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:50.213]  The President of the United States of America, when he hires someone, he'll show you what he's going to do.
[00:55:50.373 --> 00:55:51.474]  How do you feel about that statement, sir?
[00:55:52.483 --> 00:55:53.525]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:56:03.735 --> 00:56:17.738]  Students at Pittsburgh University were so triggered by Milo Yiannopoulos' critique of feminism and Black Lives Matter, they demanded counsellors should have been present in the next room to help people who were traumatised by his opinions.
[00:56:17.858 --> 00:56:23.240]  Listen to the absurd statements these whinging crybabies made after the event.
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.600]  So many of us shared in our pain.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:25.860]  I felt I was in danger.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.101]  And I felt so many people in that room were in danger.
[00:56:29.581 --> 00:56:31.942]  This is more than hurt feelings, this is about real violence.
[00:56:32.122 --> 00:56:36.344]  That so many people walked out of that event feeling in literal, physical danger is not alright.
[00:56:37.644 --> 00:56:38.685]  Real violence?
[00:56:39.145 --> 00:56:40.526]  What f***ing violence?
[00:56:40.606 --> 00:56:42.186]  There was no violence!
[00:56:42.447 --> 00:56:45.648]  Words can't sprout fists and punch you in the face.
[00:56:45.848 --> 00:56:49.289]  Opinions can't physically manifest into baseball bats.
[00:56:49.469 --> 00:56:53.071]  Words aren't weapons, they can't cause physical pain.
[00:56:53.271 --> 00:56:56.192]  Bing, bing, bing, bing, bong, bong, bing, bing, bong.
[00:56:56.292 --> 00:56:56.833]  I'm triggered.
[00:56:56.873 --> 00:57:03.055]  You're the only ones engaging in violence when you physically try to stop people from attending a Ben Shapiro lecture.
[00:57:03.075 --> 00:57:10.118]  You're the only ones engaging in violent rhetoric when you threaten to bomb Protein World and Gamergate meetups.
[00:57:10.218 --> 00:57:18.922]  You whine all day about other people's opinions being violent while using violent intimidation to stop those opinions from being heard.
[00:57:19.082 --> 00:57:20.183]  So, boo-hoo!
[00:57:20.303 --> 00:57:23.446]  Somebody disagreed with your stupid f***ing opinions.
[00:57:23.766 --> 00:57:24.227]  Big deal!
[00:57:24.247 --> 00:57:46.726]  Somebody call the waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[00:57:50.069 --> 00:57:55.455]  The only rape culture in the West is when facts rape social justice warriors.
[00:57:55.535 --> 00:57:57.097]  He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?
[00:57:57.257 --> 00:58:04.946]  Universities are supposed to be about free-flowing debate, raucous dissent and having your ideas challenged, not
[00:58:05.106 --> 00:58:09.810]  Trigger warning, safe spaces and censorship of anyone who you disagree with.
[00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:20.279]  If your reaction to your beliefs being put to the test is to start crying and demanding counselling, chances are those beliefs aren't very solid.
[00:58:21.849 --> 00:58:25.771]  Oh yeah, and being offended isn't a form of activism.
[00:58:25.831 --> 00:58:32.493]  Smearing yourselves with fake blood while chanting moronic mantras isn't going to boost your credibility.
[00:58:32.574 --> 00:58:36.335]  Listen up, pu- Your feelings don't have rights.
[00:58:36.575 --> 00:58:39.236]  You don't have a right not to be offended.
[00:58:39.336 --> 00:58:46.059]  Facts don't care if you flee to your safe space and your crybaby counseling because you can't handle them.
[00:58:46.159 --> 00:58:48.720]  Facts don't care about your feelings.
[00:58:49.501 --> 00:58:50.221]  Your feelings.
[00:58:51.189 --> 00:58:52.451]  Thanks for watching the show tonight.
