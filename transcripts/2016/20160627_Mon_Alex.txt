[00:00:02.693 --> 00:00:07.740]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.403]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:19.727 --> 00:00:21.728]  Let me just start the broadcast like this.
[00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:29.594]  Democratic Party platform officially calls for prosecuting man-made global warming skeptics.
[00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:35.718]  So we point out that all these UN heads and people are making massive amounts of money off carbon taxes.
[00:00:36.198 --> 00:00:37.579]  That's all a giant scam.
[00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:40.101]  You point out that the sun is the main driver of climate.
[00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:42.022]  They want you arrested.
[00:00:42.282 --> 00:00:43.803]  We know the Democrats have been pushing that here.
[00:00:43.823 --> 00:00:44.804]  They've been pushing it in Europe.
[00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:48.106]  But it doesn't matter that we found their emails that got hacked.
[00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:52.830]  Six years ago, showing major universities coordinating with the UN to, quote, hide the decline.
[00:00:53.711 --> 00:01:00.678]  None of that really matters, because they just want to arrest those of us that call them out for being the criminals they are.
[00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.846]  And the Communist Chinese have come out and announced incredible Internet censorship, including of Western companies that don't submit to their guidelines.
[00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:12.990]  And Reuters and others come out and kind of write about it like it's an OK thing.
[00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:15.753]  Because they don't want to be censored in China.
[00:01:16.154 --> 00:01:27.963]  In the past, as bad as our media has been, they wouldn't join with the Communist Chinese government that has mobile execution vans in every city killing political dissidents and executing you if they find out you're a closet Buddhist.
[00:01:29.084 --> 00:01:30.525]  Who the Buddhist attacked ever?
[00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:37.611]  So, this is what we're dealing with here, is just incredible totalitarianism galloping.
[00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:43.376]  And by the way, we didn't predict accurately what the EU was going to do if there was a pro-
[00:01:44.997 --> 00:01:46.398]  British exit from the Euro.
[00:01:47.598 --> 00:01:48.979]  We knew what they would do.
[00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:58.484]  They would try to trigger clauses that they have, claiming that if you don't have 75% for an exit, you're not allowed to leave.
[00:01:59.924 --> 00:02:03.566]  The UK never got to vote to enter.
[00:02:04.887 --> 00:02:08.108]  Out of 25 that have entered the EU, only two of them ever had a vote.
[00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:13.471]  Other countries have voted to get out, and when they vote to get out, they're not allowed to get out.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.800]  Now, that's called being a prisoner.
[00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:18.801]  England has its own military.
[00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:22.142]  And this is what's incredible about a ZeroHedge story up on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:22.182 --> 00:02:24.623]  We're going to be covering it in detail.
[00:02:25.223 --> 00:02:28.404]  They themselves say their answer is a new super state.
[00:02:28.924 --> 00:02:31.404]  That's what Jordan Soros called for yesterday.
[00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:36.586]  And they're telling members that haven't left yet, we're abolishing your militaries.
[00:02:38.026 --> 00:02:41.907]  And next is your police, the final phase of occupation.
[00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:45.367]  EU response to British exit.
[00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:48.790]  The Brexit, totalitarian super state.
[00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.553]  Kurt Nemo's written a story about it at Infowars.com.
[00:02:52.913 --> 00:02:55.475]  Measure will strip sovereignty of member states.
[00:02:56.216 --> 00:02:58.898]  And the New Americans reporting on it, Zero Hedge is reporting on it.
[00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.800]  It is simply mind-blowing.
[00:03:02.721 --> 00:03:03.862]  And this is what's being said.
[00:03:03.902 --> 00:03:05.023]  I mean, we knew they'd do it.
[00:03:05.844 --> 00:03:10.968]  We knew they'd come out and say, oh, sorry, it wasn't 75% or another member state of your
[00:03:13.755 --> 00:03:22.959]  United Kingdom, Scotland didn't vote to do it, so they can block you, or we're going to hold your bank account money, or we're going to blockade your trade.
[00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:38.886]  Well, Europe is teetering just as bad as the UK is under globalist control, so England should play guts ball with these EU bureaucrats and say, listen you unelected slimes, the only difference between you and Hitler is you're not driving Panzer tanks and don't have Stuka's dive-bombing
[00:03:42.168 --> 00:03:43.488]  Krakow and London.
[00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:46.650]  And Leningrad.
[00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:55.372]  Civil uprising escalates as eight EU nations threaten referendum as the eighth nation joins it.
[00:03:55.653 --> 00:03:59.714]  And their response is, hey, we're coming with our military.
[00:04:01.414 --> 00:04:05.636]  The EU overthrew two and a half years ago Ukraine, an elected government.
[00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:19.658]  Installed right-wing fascists that actually howl Hitler and then they invaded the east so hardcore That's always been Russian held that the Russians begged and seceded And they call that Russian aggression.
[00:04:19.738 --> 00:04:31.486]  Listen, I'm an American I don't have a dog in this fight other than the fact that I don't want to be part of a country that's assigned to NATO in the UN and and and the EU that are running around starting World War three
[00:04:33.843 --> 00:04:39.085]  And the Russians have come out, Putin came out in a statement and said this is similar to the collapse of the Soviet Union.
[00:04:39.165 --> 00:04:39.566]  And it is.
[00:04:40.226 --> 00:04:50.331]  An unelected, criminal, totalitarian, socialist, communist, militaristic, power-grabbing, out-of-control organization.
[00:04:50.491 --> 00:04:57.434]  That fits the EU to a T. It fits the old Soviet Union to a T. The EU needs to be destroyed!
[00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:14.020]  What was it that the Attorney General said back when he was Deputy Attorney General?
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.440]  Eric Holder.
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.241]  He said we need to literally brainwash the American people against guns.
[00:05:19.881 --> 00:05:25.643]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:05:25.703 --> 00:05:30.304]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[00:05:30.384 --> 00:05:37.246]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:46.272]  Well, that's exactly what they've at least been able to do to a certain segment of zombie-like creatures pretending they're human.
[00:05:46.432 --> 00:05:53.877]  They have convinced them that they have no right to defend themselves, and that they themselves aren't even able to stand up for their families.
[00:05:54.557 --> 00:06:03.683]  That is the true definition of slavery, where people are so disempowered, they can't even imagine that they themselves could put up any type of resistance.
[00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:07.026]  And if you won't put up a resistance to a physical attack,
[00:06:07.786 --> 00:06:12.551]  You won't put up resistance to the private Federal Reserve signing you on to trillions of debt that you don't owe.
[00:06:13.112 --> 00:06:18.858]  You won't put up a resistance to medical mafias that want to force GMO foods on your children and dangerous vaccines.
[00:06:19.359 --> 00:06:29.529]  You won't put up a resistance when Sharia law starts coming into the United States and they're canceling political rallies that mildly criticize Islam and its attacks on homosexuals.
[00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.632]  My friends, it's time to grow a spine.
[00:06:33.412 --> 00:06:39.097]  As Thomas Jefferson famously said, a nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves.
[00:06:39.657 --> 00:06:48.284]  And Rolling Stone and many other publications have come out and thrown down their stinking gauntlet, their hypocritical gauntlet, and said it's time to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:06:48.504 --> 00:06:50.886]  They admit they want to ban guns.
[00:06:50.946 --> 00:06:53.748]  They admit they want you disarmed like New York or Chicago.
[00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:57.451]  The political class wants to dominate what they see as their property.
[00:06:58.232 --> 00:06:59.233]  Are you their property?
[00:06:59.873 --> 00:07:02.994]  Will you sit there and let their jihadis mow you and your family down?
[00:07:03.494 --> 00:07:07.235]  Or will you stand up and become self-sufficient and start defending your family?
[00:07:07.735 --> 00:07:08.875]  Really, the choice is up to you.
[00:07:08.975 --> 00:07:19.238]  The American birthright started over the attempt to confiscate our guns in Lexington and Concord in 1775, leading to July 4, 1776 and our Declaration of Independence.
[00:07:19.698 --> 00:07:21.979]  You've got to decide whether you want that birthright
[00:07:22.799 --> 00:07:24.620]  Or if you want the birthright of slaves.
[00:07:25.441 --> 00:07:26.742]  If you want to be slaves, that's great.
[00:07:27.082 --> 00:07:30.164]  May your chains set lightly upon you, to quote Patrick Henry.
[00:07:30.744 --> 00:07:32.965]  But as for me, give me liberty.
[00:07:33.706 --> 00:07:34.747]  Or give me death.
[00:07:35.367 --> 00:07:37.788]  The great battle for the Second Amendment is happening now.
[00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:39.910]  The first phase is an info war.
[00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:45.294]  And I suggest all of you understand the big assault is happening as we speak.
[00:07:45.894 --> 00:07:51.919]  The greatest attack on our freedoms that we've ever witnessed, not just the Second Amendment, is happening today.
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.982]  All good men and women must come to the aid of their country.
[00:07:55.402 --> 00:07:58.224]  And that fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:18.894]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.116 --> 00:08:26.599]  The story's linked up at DrugsReport.com, it's linked up on InfoWars.com as well.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:40.689]  The Daily Caller, Democratic Party platform calls for prosecuting global warming skeptics, and they have the subsection there and even a video of them talking about how wonderful it's going to be.
[00:08:42.952 --> 00:08:52.436]  That is the criminal persecution of the American people in line with what the UN's been saying they want.
[00:08:52.956 --> 00:09:11.124]  If you come out and expose this criminal world government takeover that is to be funded with at least 100 trillion every decade off of carbon taxes with Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, Bill Clinton, most of the British leadership, Obama, the Rothschilds,
[00:09:12.861 --> 00:09:24.941]  The other classic elitist names, the Soroses, all standing to make billions apiece per year off of all of your carbon activity.
[00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:28.259]  Because they haven't been able to implement this all over the United States.
[00:09:28.299 --> 00:09:37.945]  I see it in Austin, I see it in San Francisco particularly, so-called liberal areas, that means brainwashed cult member, anti-liberal areas, zombie areas, fascist areas, slave areas, where people love being slaves.
[00:09:38.445 --> 00:09:44.628]  They have carbon indulgences on their car, like you're paying it to the Vatican to stay out of hell or something, you know, Cicero, 800 years ago.
[00:09:44.648 --> 00:09:49.851]  And it says, I pay a carbon tax to this private company.
[00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:53.093]  And then they offset what I'm doing, planting trees or whatever.
[00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.650]  And of course it turns out almost all of that's a giant scam as well.
[00:09:56.991 --> 00:10:08.072]  But this is just where you pay for carbon taxes directly to the London and Chicago and Frankfurt mercantiles and the Paris mercantiles for a giant commodities screwjob.
[00:10:08.693 --> 00:10:16.174]  A global commodities tax run and operated by private interest tax exempt with diplomatic immunity.
[00:10:17.414 --> 00:10:22.595]  Of course they want to arrest you if you call these criminals.
[00:10:23.883 --> 00:10:25.924]  Simply mind-blowing.
[00:10:25.944 --> 00:10:27.045]  I mean, we told you it was coming.
[00:10:27.545 --> 00:10:31.128]  They have personally said that I should be arrested in major British newspapers.
[00:10:31.488 --> 00:10:33.689]  They say it on a weekly basis about Lord Monckton.
[00:10:34.209 --> 00:10:35.410]  They talk about Mark Moreno.
[00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:40.333]  They actually had wanted signs in Paris when he premiered his film a few months ago there in Paris.
[00:10:40.353 --> 00:10:44.156]  And you're like, oh, they're just joking around.
[00:10:44.876 --> 00:10:45.797]  No, they're not.
[00:10:48.018 --> 00:10:49.699]  You saw what happened in Sacramento.
[00:10:50.059 --> 00:10:52.140]  Two idiot groups in a fight with each other.
[00:10:53.305 --> 00:10:53.985]  But here's the difference.
[00:10:54.045 --> 00:10:58.087]  At least the neo-Nazis were anti-globalists and understand this country's being captured.
[00:10:58.127 --> 00:11:09.552]  The useful, idiot, racist BAM group, by any means necessary, that's really an anti-white group from my research, they ran around and began beating people with sticks and hitting them over the head.
[00:11:09.572 --> 00:11:14.994]  And so, wow, the white nationalists stabbed them back.
[00:11:16.655 --> 00:11:18.295]  And so I'll tell you who's in the wrong here.
[00:11:18.415 --> 00:11:19.776]  It's the communists.
[00:11:21.087 --> 00:11:23.707]  And by the way, they are so Ford Foundation funded, it is just...
[00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:25.430]  Ridiculous.
[00:11:26.031 --> 00:11:32.433]  The image of the police, though, in their black uniforms, taking photos of who's stabbing who and who's hitting who.
[00:11:32.473 --> 00:11:34.694]  We're showing that right now on TV for TV viewers.
[00:11:34.974 --> 00:11:36.995]  Please never forget if you're a new listener, we're not just radio.
[00:11:37.275 --> 00:11:39.156]  We like to add an added dimension of documentation.
[00:11:39.556 --> 00:11:45.739]  Infowars.com forward slash show and the TV stations around the country, cable stations, starting to pick up the show.
[00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:51.882]  I haven't really gone to that phase of launch yet because I've been so busy getting new reporters and adding crew and
[00:11:53.023 --> 00:11:57.812]  But we've got cable station in Houston and some UHF and VHF and cable stations around the country.
[00:11:57.832 --> 00:12:01.379]  It's more than 20 right now, I know of, but we're about to do a big push and get hundreds.
[00:12:03.072 --> 00:12:06.875]  A lot of it's also funding, but I'm going to digress from there.
[00:12:06.975 --> 00:12:12.860]  Everybody knows Infowars is exponentially growing and reaching more people, especially when it comes to the Internet itself.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:22.747]  That's why the federal government bought out by foreign interest isn't just pushing with the Democrats to arrest people that talk about man-made global warming being a tax scam fraud.
[00:12:24.168 --> 00:12:26.170]  They are also coming out
[00:12:27.805 --> 00:12:40.889]  And pushing taxing by the mile with the magic boxes in the last 14, 15 years or so that magically fell into all the cars manufactured from North America to Europe to Japan to South Korea to China.
[00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:51.953]  Global standardization by accident of little boxes that you pay for as part of the cost of the car to tax you by the mile, but they're also going to keep the gas tax on top of it.
[00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:55.120]  I've been telling you that for 20 years.
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.742]  It's now started in Europe, it's now started in many states like Oregon.
[00:12:59.102 --> 00:13:05.046]  Now the Washington Post announces the whole East Coast is about to go together in a giant screw job of epic proportions.
[00:13:08.348 --> 00:13:10.589]  And the attack on free speech just accelerates.
[00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.391]  But we're going to be looking at all of that.
[00:13:13.471 --> 00:13:20.615]  Speaking of the devil, ABC News reports, here's the headline, UN says more Central Americans headed to US.
[00:13:21.781 --> 00:13:43.553]  And right down in McCallum, Texas, where two of our reporters are today, and are going to be coming on the broadcast, incidentally, where two of our reporters are right now, they just announced, oh yeah, there's hundreds of thousands from Latin America, they just show up, they're illegal, the newscast admits, but then they're just set up at the bus station by the
[00:13:45.455 --> 00:13:55.786]  Border Patrol and then they get given vouchers and they get sent to different areas of the country, just released out into the open, but sent to Democratic Party facilities to be set up, put on welfare, given driver's license.
[00:13:56.146 --> 00:14:01.532]  Remember a flashback about this two years ago, back in June of 2014?
[00:14:02.073 --> 00:14:05.837]  Jakari Jackson and others showed you them admitting all this.
[00:14:07.944 --> 00:14:09.245]  Of course, I can't go to Honduras.
[00:14:09.325 --> 00:14:10.245]  I can't go to Chile.
[00:14:10.325 --> 00:14:13.026]  I can't go to Central or South America and get anything free.
[00:14:13.206 --> 00:14:17.968]  But it's like, oh, it's families with children and their husbands, of course, and others.
[00:14:18.729 --> 00:14:19.389]  70% are children.
[00:14:20.249 --> 00:14:24.651]  And it doesn't matter if Kevin Pagan, emergency management person, thinks it's OK.
[00:14:24.711 --> 00:14:25.051]  It's not.
[00:14:26.832 --> 00:14:29.413]  And no one covered this but Drudge two years ago.
[00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:31.734]  And now it's, oh, the local news.
[00:14:31.974 --> 00:14:33.195]  Oh, we're just being loving.
[00:14:33.215 --> 00:14:33.915]  We're helping.
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.922]  And then, don't forget this headline from a few months ago.
[00:14:36.942 --> 00:14:37.642]  It just caught us in.
[00:14:37.722 --> 00:14:42.526]  Obama administration and UN announced global police force to fight extremism in US.
[00:14:44.989 --> 00:14:52.795]  The Strong Cities Initiative, and they're suing Arpaio and others, that if a drunk driver happens to be illegal, he takes him to jail, and that's mean.
[00:14:55.734 --> 00:14:57.495]  So, isn't that just precious?
[00:14:58.235 --> 00:15:01.577]  Isn't that just the cutest thing you've ever seen in your life?
[00:15:01.837 --> 00:15:02.297]  This is it.
[00:15:02.337 --> 00:15:04.779]  People say, oh, the UN doesn't run things.
[00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:06.099]  You know, the US and Europe do.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:24.489]  Yes, the UN is the multinational group with the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, where multinational corporations set up boards and then they get governments to consolidate power into unions and then those unions waive their power to dictatorial, unelected, secret corporate boards
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:30.503]  And the EU Parliament is admittedly ceremonial, has no power, it's advisory.
[00:15:32.804 --> 00:15:42.069]  And then now the EU announced Sunday, Soros came out and said, quote, we need to have an emergency reconstitution.
[00:15:42.449 --> 00:15:47.612]  First, the EU needs to go down, but then it needs to be reconstituted into a super state.
[00:15:47.692 --> 00:15:48.132]  And guess what?
[00:15:48.152 --> 00:15:49.533]  The proposal is now out.
[00:15:49.673 --> 00:15:53.555]  The Polish newspapers have gotten the proposal from The Hague in the Netherlands.
[00:15:53.615 --> 00:15:54.816]  And guess what it says?
[00:15:57.102 --> 00:16:05.290]  Members that are still in are having their governments dissolved and their militaries dissolved and are going under EU command.
[00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.413]  The militaries will still stand but will now have EU commanders.
[00:16:09.013 --> 00:16:14.979]  That's just like when the Germans came into France and let the French Army in place but put their commanders in place.
[00:16:16.493 --> 00:16:17.554]  Because the public went along with it.
[00:16:17.574 --> 00:16:18.955]  They were called the Vichy French.
[00:16:19.435 --> 00:16:24.479]  And I hammer that because Germany didn't really beat France in two weeks.
[00:16:25.159 --> 00:16:28.301]  They didn't just really run over the Maginot Line and the Blitzkrieg.
[00:16:28.762 --> 00:16:37.568]  They had a deal with almost the entire general staff of the French to take over and turn power over to them and set it up in the south of France and they did.
[00:16:37.828 --> 00:16:39.650]  But that's barely in the history books.
[00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:41.671]  It's an absolute incontrovertible fact.
[00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:45.154]  But that's what globalism is.
[00:16:46.352 --> 00:16:51.414]  Most of war is using your intelligence agencies to buy off foreign governments before you invade.
[00:16:51.434 --> 00:16:55.556]  That's what they did to Iraq in 1991 and in 2003.
[00:16:55.956 --> 00:17:02.899]  And then they have Panetta, the former head of the CIA, come out when Trump talks about it and go, we didn't pay anybody off in Iraq.
[00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:03.799]  That's ridiculous.
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.941]  They paid Iraq off upwards of $60 billion, admittedly.
[00:17:12.358 --> 00:17:16.200]  Before, during, and after that so-called invasion in the first year.
[00:17:17.761 --> 00:17:18.622]  That's admitted.
[00:17:21.703 --> 00:17:25.265]  But that's how dumb they think you are.
[00:17:26.466 --> 00:17:27.327]  And that's what they've done here.
[00:17:27.347 --> 00:17:35.831]  They've come in and bought off the government, and we're openly going under world government, and they have an Atlantic Treaty merging the NAU that was signed in secret in 2005 in Baylor,
[00:17:38.729 --> 00:17:43.694]  University in Waco, Texas by Vicente Fox, Paul Martin, and George W. Bush.
[00:17:44.394 --> 00:17:45.375]  And it was even local paper.
[00:17:45.435 --> 00:17:46.276]  They signed a treaty.
[00:17:46.396 --> 00:17:47.017]  It's secret.
[00:17:47.577 --> 00:17:52.282]  Then we, two years later, they are having the Banff meeting to ratify it in secret.
[00:17:52.782 --> 00:17:53.943]  Judicial Watch sues.
[00:17:53.963 --> 00:17:55.284]  Gets 2,000 plus pages.
[00:17:55.625 --> 00:17:59.488]  I actually read or scanned all 2,000 pages and made the film in-game.
[00:17:59.909 --> 00:18:04.573]  And I show the pages with admitting stealth integration to world government.
[00:18:07.008 --> 00:18:13.929]  With the goals of the total corporate rule, with the corporations voting, and then having the heads of state agree, executively, to follow it.
[00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:16.230]  And I made the film Endgame.
[00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:18.390]  Talk about sensational.
[00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:19.870]  That's how this works.
[00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.311]  That's how the TPP works.
[00:18:21.611 --> 00:18:25.831]  That's how all this works, and it's being done out in the open now.
[00:18:27.552 --> 00:18:31.412]  And their answer is not to hold Europe hostage and plunge their stock market.
[00:18:32.593 --> 00:18:34.013]  They're already plunging the stock market.
[00:18:35.044 --> 00:18:41.488]  Soros is running around saying British exit makes EU disintegration irreversible, but again, on the ashes of it, he wants to build a super state.
[00:18:42.469 --> 00:18:45.251]  So some will say, well then, this is actually a trap, it's a setup.
[00:18:45.331 --> 00:18:46.051]  No, they're opportunists.
[00:18:46.071 --> 00:18:48.433]  When they start losing one angle, they jump to the other side.
[00:18:49.814 --> 00:18:50.754]  They're divide and conquer.
[00:18:51.435 --> 00:18:52.495]  It's full spectrum dominance.
[00:18:52.815 --> 00:18:55.537]  They fund ISIS and Al Qaeda, they fight ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[00:18:56.798 --> 00:18:58.779]  They fund the Arab Spring, then they fight the Arab Spring.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.281]  Order out of chaos.
[00:19:05.896 --> 00:19:18.522]  But why we're winning is we're educating the public that there's really a corporate world shadow government who, by the way, wants you to be impoverished and controlled towards a eugenics phased out soft kill.
[00:19:19.782 --> 00:19:20.483]  That's not rhetoric.
[00:19:20.523 --> 00:19:21.203]  That's the truth.
[00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:21.903]  You're seeing it all.
[00:19:22.163 --> 00:19:22.624]  Manifest.
[00:19:22.924 --> 00:19:23.644]  Everything I've told you.
[00:19:23.784 --> 00:19:24.585]  Word for word happening.
[00:19:25.125 --> 00:19:26.465]  Because it's a game plan.
[00:19:26.786 --> 00:19:27.406]  Not my opinion.
[00:19:28.586 --> 00:19:30.988]  I wish I could say I just envisioned all this and I was psychic.
[00:19:31.008 --> 00:19:31.648]  That's not the case.
[00:19:33.223 --> 00:19:35.624]  Everybody's got a sixth sense, but it goes beyond that.
[00:19:35.664 --> 00:19:37.325]  You gotta know what you're looking at, historically.
[00:19:37.865 --> 00:19:38.605]  And it's all here!
[00:19:38.965 --> 00:19:40.966]  You just gotta admit it's happening, then we can beat it!
[00:19:41.666 --> 00:19:47.208]  But the good news is, we're admitting world government, we're admitting it's totalitarian, we're admitting it's far removed, illegitimate, and lying.
[00:19:47.628 --> 00:19:51.730]  Once you get to that point, only dictatorship can keep them in place, and those always fall!
[00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:57.992]  And the EU's now announcing a military dicta- They're actually saying, prepare for us to take over your governments!
[00:19:58.072 --> 00:19:59.513]  I mean, this is sensational!
[00:20:01.684 --> 00:20:03.085]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:20:03.125 --> 00:20:04.206]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:20:04.466 --> 00:20:05.386]  Why is this so good?
[00:20:05.667 --> 00:20:10.909]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:20:11.009 --> 00:20:24.557]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:20:24.597 --> 00:20:25.998]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:20:26.678 --> 00:20:26.998]  I don't know.
[00:20:47.162 --> 00:20:49.343]  You have to disintegrate the lining.
[00:20:49.363 --> 00:20:54.365]  I mean, viruses protect themselves, and so do bacteria, protozoa, and mycoplasms.
[00:20:54.765 --> 00:20:58.987]  They have a protective shell that a lot of times the immune system can't even get into.
[00:20:59.187 --> 00:21:00.228]  Our own immune system.
[00:21:00.788 --> 00:21:03.489]  Especially since most people's immune system are weak anyway.
[00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:06.190]  People can avoid toxic air if they want.
[00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:07.870]  They can get an air purification system.
[00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:14.052]  They can avoid toxic water and drink clean water, but it's really hard to avoid parasites.
[00:21:14.532 --> 00:21:18.813]  It's hard to avoid attacking organisms and that's where I see this going.
[00:21:18.833 --> 00:21:20.854]  I mean, I think a lot of the information that we
[00:21:21.474 --> 00:21:21.934]  We're good to go.
[00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.650]  So the Living Defense is amazing.
[00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.151]  We've seen just tremendous reviews.
[00:21:47.811 --> 00:21:49.971]  How often should you take Living Defense?
[00:21:49.991 --> 00:21:51.372]  I mean, is it a regimen every day?
[00:21:51.412 --> 00:21:53.232]  That's what I was doing until we ran out.
[00:21:53.572 --> 00:21:55.292]  Or do you do it heavier for certain cleanses?
[00:21:55.312 --> 00:21:56.153]  What do you do, Dr. Group?
[00:21:56.833 --> 00:22:08.375]  Well, I do usually six weeks at a time, because if you look at the life cycle of most parasites, it's six weeks from the time... So you're gonna kill the ones that are in there and then kill their babies when the eggs hatch up?
[00:22:08.715 --> 00:22:23.309]  If you're suffering from abdominal pain, allergies, even like headaches, anemia, weakened immune system, gut problems, depression, hair loss, excess gas, muscle pain, nervousness, I mean all these things.
[00:22:23.349 --> 00:22:30.436]  If you look at some of these conditions and then us opening up our borders and all the other countries opening up their borders.
[00:22:30.976 --> 00:22:41.439]  You're just dealing with a mass amount of parasites or harmful organisms or biological weapons that are spreading and mutating all across the world.
[00:22:41.459 --> 00:22:45.581]  And I think that's one of the reasons why, I mean, all you have to do is look at the news these days.
[00:22:46.161 --> 00:22:48.583]  You can type in refugees spreading disease.
[00:22:48.643 --> 00:22:50.946]  I mean the CDC is going crazy right now.
[00:22:51.566 --> 00:22:55.971]  There's a new antibiotic resistant E. coli that they just identified.
[00:22:56.091 --> 00:22:57.192]  Doctors don't know.
[00:22:57.272 --> 00:23:00.915]  They don't teach doctors in medical school about parasites and harmful organisms.
[00:23:00.955 --> 00:23:03.057]  There's a reason why they don't teach them about that.
[00:23:03.158 --> 00:23:06.381]  Just like they don't teach doctors about the root cause of disease.
[00:23:06.861 --> 00:23:09.122]  And how to eliminate all disease out there.
[00:23:09.162 --> 00:23:10.563]  They don't want you to know about it.
[00:23:10.823 --> 00:23:13.524]  You don't want your own immune system being attacked.
[00:23:13.804 --> 00:23:17.186]  Again, you know, you have animals, especially your cats, dogs.
[00:23:17.206 --> 00:23:19.067]  So many people have pets these days.
[00:23:19.547 --> 00:23:20.948]  People eat raw sushi.
[00:23:21.348 --> 00:23:22.989]  People eat more raw food.
[00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:27.191]  You have all these different organisms showing up in the water supplies now.
[00:23:27.731 --> 00:23:31.053]  You even have it in the air supplies, these tiny microorganisms.
[00:23:31.093 --> 00:23:33.914]  So it's not like we can get away from them.
[00:23:33.974 --> 00:23:35.455]  We just have to do everything.
[00:23:35.535 --> 00:23:39.137]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[00:23:39.157 --> 00:23:39.557]  All right.
[00:23:39.597 --> 00:23:42.419]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:23:42.439 --> 00:23:43.459]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:23:43.499 --> 00:23:44.039]  Living Defense.
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.380]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.461]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:23:46.481 --> 00:23:47.201]  It's full of stuff.
[00:23:47.241 --> 00:23:48.542]  It's great for your body, period.
[00:23:49.182 --> 00:23:51.063]  And you support the broadcast.
[00:23:51.123 --> 00:23:52.204]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:23:52.484 --> 00:23:54.365]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:23:54.745 --> 00:23:56.706]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.481]  It really is dizzying.
[00:24:11.082 --> 00:24:12.363]  Dizzying is the word.
[00:24:14.144 --> 00:24:28.514]  When I sit here every day at night, getting ready, doing research, during the morning, getting ready, doing research, coming in, looking at hundreds of news articles that they've printed off, many of which I haven't seen, trying to just gauge it all,
[00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:46.883]  And then going out and seeing the billboards, and hearing the radio, and seeing the entertainment TV shows, and hearing people talk, and seeing propaganda at every level, and to see people captured in a scientific technotronic technocracy.
[00:24:47.904 --> 00:24:51.647]  That's the elite's name for worldwide scientific dictatorship.
[00:24:52.127 --> 00:24:55.150]  Just Google, Davos calls for scientific dictatorship.
[00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.633]  You'll get articles with them saying that six years ago.
[00:25:01.087 --> 00:25:03.608]  Club of Rome wrote about it in 1963!
[00:25:03.648 --> 00:25:14.795]  I used to go to the microfilm at the UT library and pull this stuff out just to come read it on air, and people didn't believe me in 1996, 97, 98.
[00:25:15.615 --> 00:25:22.379]  So I said, I'm going to try to have a webcam that's good enough to show people these newspaper printouts and these documents.
[00:25:24.124 --> 00:25:32.509]  Because back when they thought they had the public in the 60s, man, they were like, we're going to have UN troops on the streets, we're going to take all the guns, we're going to end the family.
[00:25:32.629 --> 00:25:34.210]  This was in the Washington Post.
[00:25:36.191 --> 00:25:37.792]  We're going to have 10 FEMA regions.
[00:25:40.194 --> 00:25:44.717]  I wish I could find that somewhere in my archives, which is a bunch of storage facilities.
[00:25:46.198 --> 00:25:48.439]  I tried to consolidate from like seven of them down to three.
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.201]  And the actual New York Times.
[00:25:52.421 --> 00:25:53.901]  Actual New York Times.
[00:25:55.762 --> 00:25:59.543]  I had the microfilm of it and then it was Bernadine Smith.
[00:26:00.283 --> 00:26:02.924]  She ran the Second Amendment Foundation out in California.
[00:26:03.424 --> 00:26:08.305]  That lady mailed me the actual New York Times from 1937 with the 10 regions of FEMA.
[00:26:09.305 --> 00:26:10.565]  Folks, they didn't set that up till 1979.
[00:26:11.546 --> 00:26:16.187]  I mean these people aren't playing around and I'm sitting here
[00:26:17.759 --> 00:26:19.821]  Here's the allegory.
[00:26:19.861 --> 00:26:20.901]  Here's the parable.
[00:26:20.941 --> 00:26:21.662]  Here's the parallel.
[00:26:21.702 --> 00:26:22.923]  Here's the comparison.
[00:26:24.204 --> 00:26:29.087]  It'd be like if I was a police detective and they get a call about a home disturbance.
[00:26:29.148 --> 00:26:32.330]  The police go out there and a guy has killed his wife with a meat cleaver.
[00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.952]  They're gonna go ahead and take him into jail.
[00:26:35.512 --> 00:26:41.096]  He's gonna get charged with probably capital murder if it's premeditated.
[00:26:42.057 --> 00:26:43.238]  They go ahead and search the house.
[00:26:43.258 --> 00:26:46.981]  They go down in the basement and they see photos of all these women.
[00:26:50.672 --> 00:26:57.359]  I mean, there's not a debate they found 25 bodies.
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.383]  And the neighbors, though, in most cases have Stockholm Syndrome or just are in total denial.
[00:27:02.144 --> 00:27:05.568]  They'll never believe Harvey or Bob was such a nice man.
[00:27:12.754 --> 00:27:15.415]  And I'm sitting here with all the admitted evidence.
[00:27:15.475 --> 00:27:16.716]  I mean, it's out in the open.
[00:27:16.896 --> 00:27:18.236]  The EU is unelected.
[00:27:18.256 --> 00:27:19.037]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:27:19.357 --> 00:27:20.537]  The EU is unelected.
[00:27:20.798 --> 00:27:22.638]  The United Kingdom didn't vote to enter it.
[00:27:24.019 --> 00:27:25.360]  I'm going to cover this in the next segment.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.700]  I have the article right here.
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:32.803]  It's now threatening to dissolve, and Kurt's article's good, but it just should be.
[00:27:35.188 --> 00:27:35.788]  Bombshell!
[00:27:35.948 --> 00:27:38.190]  EU moves to dissolve member state militaries.
[00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.071]  Goes into full coup mode.
[00:27:40.491 --> 00:27:48.035]  Dissolving... I mean, it's like in Star Wars Episode 4, when Governor Tarkin... Can we cue that up off one of the movie clip sites?
[00:27:48.616 --> 00:27:58.882]  Governor Tarkin walks into the Death Star, and Darth Vader comes walking in, and they're arguing about how to control the local, you know, star systems with the governors.
[00:27:59.798 --> 00:28:04.000]  And with the local councils, and Governor Target says we're dissolving the regional councils.
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.520]  He says that's impossible!
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.521]  How will the Emperor maintain control?
[00:28:07.941 --> 00:28:12.183]  With the regional governors, in fear of this battle station, the equivalent of a nuclear weapon.
[00:28:17.085 --> 00:28:25.428]  We actually have them putting out an official memorandum saying you're not allowed to leave, and we're going to dissolve your militaries.
[00:28:29.226 --> 00:28:32.248]  That's their response to eight member nations saying they're moving for referendum.
[00:28:33.009 --> 00:28:39.474]  Within two days of that, they come out and say, we are preparing to take over your military.
[00:28:39.514 --> 00:28:40.014]  Stand by.
[00:28:40.034 --> 00:28:42.336]  And then the mainstream people go, it's totally normal.
[00:28:42.536 --> 00:28:44.938]  The EU showed up in the next few months.
[00:28:45.258 --> 00:28:46.279]  Oh, their commander.
[00:28:46.359 --> 00:28:48.260]  Oh, and guess who the EU commanders already are?
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.061]  NATO.
[00:28:51.302 --> 00:28:56.326]  Where Hitler couldn't succeed, NATO is about to succeed in a total European dictatorship.
[00:28:56.766 --> 00:28:57.387]  And just like
[00:28:58.601 --> 00:28:59.722]  Just like part three.
[00:29:00.923 --> 00:29:07.808]  Just like Russia was in a fight in World War I with the Germans, and World War II and the German globalists run the EU, now here it is again.
[00:29:07.848 --> 00:29:10.930]  They're busy starting a war with the Russians yet again.
[00:29:12.391 --> 00:29:22.538]  With a bunch of war-mongering, weirdo, feminist women running a whole show at our Pentagon and State Department who've never been in combat, never been in the military, never killed anybody.
[00:29:23.959 --> 00:29:26.761]  And I'm not saying that because they can't commit atrocities and aren't tough.
[00:29:26.861 --> 00:29:27.122]  Oh, no, no.
[00:29:28.078 --> 00:29:33.682]  It's so dangerous to have people in the positions of starting wars who've never been in a war.
[00:29:35.543 --> 00:29:37.704]  Boy, that spells disaster.
[00:29:38.625 --> 00:29:48.651]  You got a bunch of weird, cocky women with big, giant, 10-carat diamond rings at the State Department talking about murdering Russians in body bags and swaggering around.
[00:29:48.951 --> 00:29:49.892]  That's crazy!
[00:29:50.713 --> 00:29:51.613]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.093 --> 00:29:53.714]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.635 --> 00:29:57.337]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.522 --> 00:30:06.944]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:14.429]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:23.415]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:30:23.635 --> 00:30:27.798]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:30:28.058 --> 00:30:33.422]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:30:33.662 --> 00:30:37.505]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:30:37.885 --> 00:30:40.968]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:30:41.308 --> 00:30:52.416]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:30:52.456 --> 00:30:55.118]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[00:30:55.358 --> 00:31:01.323]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[00:31:01.963 --> 00:31:09.433]  In 1993, Hillary Clinton ordered Vince Foster's dead body to be moved and dumped to avoid a murder investigation.
[00:31:09.754 --> 00:31:13.279]  New York Times best-selling author Roger Stone names names.
[00:31:13.659 --> 00:31:16.383]  The Clintons War on Women in stores now.
[00:31:17.584 --> 00:31:18.625]  Special Force selection.
[00:31:18.705 --> 00:31:21.026]  It's not like you could ever take the easy road.
[00:31:21.066 --> 00:31:24.769]  You can't take steroids to make, you know, being a Special Force operator easy.
[00:31:24.809 --> 00:31:31.093]  I'm always looking for the best and natural way to get myself to the limit.
[00:31:31.113 --> 00:31:32.794]  I have to have the edge over my opponents.
[00:31:32.854 --> 00:31:36.096]  I believe that Super Male Vitality, you know, that gives me the edge.
[00:31:36.656 --> 00:31:40.739]  I've been taking it, and I'm still getting faster and stronger every day.
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:46.163]  Start your journey to Super Male Vitality today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:31:47.341 --> 00:31:50.383]  Finally, the mainstream media is reporting on what we broke two years ago.
[00:31:50.403 --> 00:31:50.923]  The U.S.
[00:31:50.963 --> 00:31:58.188]  Customs and Border Patrol, under pressure from the Obama administration, is purchasing bus tickets for illegals to ship them deeper into the country at taxpayers' expense.
[00:31:58.388 --> 00:32:10.235]  Local news station KRGV is now covering how the McAllen, Texas bus station is used as a transit hub for illegals Obama is bringing into the country, which Infowars.com exclusively broke in 2014 when no one else dared to report on it.
[00:32:10.315 --> 00:32:14.738]  KRGV has revealed that over 100 illegals a day are being dropped off at the McAllen station.
[00:32:14.998 --> 00:32:15.418]  And, in 2014,
[00:32:16.579 --> 00:32:22.664]  InfoWars reported on how the Obama administration was ordering the Border Patrol to release illegals they've apprehended after crossing the border.
[00:32:22.764 --> 00:32:31.551]  But, as part of their release, the illegals are transported to the McAllen bus station by Border Patrol agents, who then buy them tickets to go wherever they want to go in the U.S.
[00:32:31.791 --> 00:32:35.434]  So, for example, if the illegals have relatives in Boston, that's where they get to go.
[00:32:35.634 --> 00:32:38.637]  And taxpayers are paying for this illegal smuggling operation.
[00:32:38.777 --> 00:32:42.500]  To find out more about Obama's lawlessness, visit InfoWars.com.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.961]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:32:46.889 --> 00:32:54.553]  As first lady and co-president, did Hillary Clinton order the Waco siege that left 18 children dead?
[00:32:55.573 --> 00:32:59.095]  Find out in The Clinton's War on Women.
[00:33:14.617 --> 00:33:22.122]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[00:33:23.103 --> 00:33:27.005]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:27.466 --> 00:33:31.268]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:33:31.649 --> 00:33:33.190]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:39.114]  Take your children and yourself and hide out in the cellar.
[00:33:41.975 --> 00:33:52.218]  Lord Monckton is not just the champion globally exposing man-made global warming and the carbon taxes and world government totalitarian fraud and taxation scam.
[00:33:52.698 --> 00:34:02.201]  He is undoubtedly the chief long-term resistor of the EU dictatorship.
[00:34:03.001 --> 00:34:07.302]  You could say that Nigel Farage is now the leader of the
[00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:12.691]  Anti-EU tyranny movement.
[00:34:13.712 --> 00:34:30.886]  And what's so exciting about this is, they only began to be Eurosceptics Moncton 30-something years ago, but Farage 25 years ago, they've only been really politically active, 20, and they've already are the fastest growing party, not just in the UK, but Europe, and just had one of the biggest political victories for sovereignty.
[00:34:32.162 --> 00:34:35.745]  And what this is going to lead to is the equivalent of the Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776.
[00:34:36.966 --> 00:34:44.071]  The will to do this, having the leadership, being in the right, will win the war.
[00:34:44.512 --> 00:34:45.853]  We're in the right, we can't lose.
[00:34:45.933 --> 00:34:52.658]  And this is as big as 1776, in the whole chain of Magna Carta, 1776, this event.
[00:34:52.958 --> 00:34:54.859]  And I'm not just saying that.
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.102]  Even the globalists are saying this is one of the biggest events in history.
[00:34:59.906 --> 00:35:02.368]  We're going to explain why, but we knew this was coming.
[00:35:03.108 --> 00:35:07.251]  As soon as I saw this this morning, I went, oh my God, Lord Monckton has hammered this over and over again.
[00:35:07.811 --> 00:35:10.072]  A plan to get rid of nation-state armies.
[00:35:11.273 --> 00:35:22.100]  Kurt Neumann wrote a story where the Polish papers have gotten the EU plan in their, quote, emergency reorganization for a, quote, super state to now tell countries before they can leave, we're just going to take your military over.
[00:35:23.101 --> 00:35:23.381]  Why not?
[00:35:23.421 --> 00:35:25.282]  They already make all the laws and aren't elected.
[00:35:26.303 --> 00:35:26.543]  And then?
[00:35:28.547 --> 00:35:32.390]  One of our writers put this report out June 23rd.
[00:35:32.811 --> 00:35:34.572]  Kit Daniels ran in and brought it to my attention.
[00:35:34.592 --> 00:35:36.074]  He said, Alex, we wrote about this last week.
[00:35:36.374 --> 00:35:40.057]  Proposed EU army hidden from British voters until after Brexit.
[00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:43.560]  EU army proposal to remain hidden from British voters until day after Brexit vote.
[00:35:44.221 --> 00:35:45.681]  This was the day before the vote.
[00:35:46.401 --> 00:35:48.082]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is so unprecedented.
[00:35:48.122 --> 00:35:52.203]  When I'm reading the actual EU proposal, I can't believe it.
[00:35:52.703 --> 00:35:56.243]  It's like seeing Hitler invade France or Czechoslovakia or Poland.
[00:35:56.963 --> 00:36:00.184]  I mean, if you were alive at that time, you're seeing it unfold.
[00:36:01.584 --> 00:36:03.245]  And I just don't know what to say at this point.
[00:36:03.265 --> 00:36:04.845]  I mean, I know they're criminals.
[00:36:04.905 --> 00:36:05.725]  I know they're tyrannical.
[00:36:05.765 --> 00:36:07.926]  But my God, oh, eight countries want to leave?
[00:36:08.286 --> 00:36:09.666]  We're taking over your militaries.
[00:36:11.383 --> 00:36:11.663]  What?
[00:36:12.364 --> 00:36:15.807]  I mean, we're going to arrest Germans that criticize open borders.
[00:36:15.827 --> 00:36:16.547]  We're going to arrest Swedes.
[00:36:16.567 --> 00:36:17.748]  We're going to Lord Moxley in just a moment.
[00:36:18.068 --> 00:36:20.050]  I'm not going to belabor this, but we're listener-supported.
[00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:21.471]  We're not sponsor-supported.
[00:36:21.891 --> 00:36:22.552]  80% is listener.
[00:36:23.793 --> 00:36:27.636]  We don't just have the very best products at some of the lowest prices out there.
[00:36:27.716 --> 00:36:30.198]  We are the tip of the spear worldwide in full wars.
[00:36:32.652 --> 00:36:35.894]  Is reaching the most people when it comes to fighting the New World Order.
[00:36:36.794 --> 00:36:40.736]  Drudge overall reaches a lot more people in general, and he's fighting them as well, doing a great job.
[00:36:41.136 --> 00:36:44.498]  I'm not here bragging, hey, we're one of the biggest ships in this fight.
[00:36:44.598 --> 00:36:46.339]  I don't like being the main target.
[00:36:46.659 --> 00:36:49.100]  I can tell you right now, I want to see other people come on the stage.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:56.944]  But look, the Democratic platform now officially calls to pass laws to arrest climate change deniers.
[00:36:57.624 --> 00:36:59.445]  That is Daily Caller in it today.
[00:36:59.485 --> 00:37:00.746]  That's now in the platform.
[00:37:01.544 --> 00:37:04.546]  They're wanting to arrest this man every day in the newspapers.
[00:37:05.347 --> 00:37:05.827]  Lord Monckton.
[00:37:05.847 --> 00:37:06.708]  They're coming for us.
[00:37:06.748 --> 00:37:08.149]  And people say, well, we better give up.
[00:37:08.869 --> 00:37:14.313]  No, when they hang up signs in Paris saying, arrest Mark Moreno for his film, that's a badge of honor.
[00:37:14.774 --> 00:37:17.596]  When communists show up and stab people, that's a badge of honor like they did.
[00:37:17.936 --> 00:37:19.697]  This is, they're making their move.
[00:37:19.717 --> 00:37:20.778]  We're going to go to Lord Monckton in a moment.
[00:37:22.031 --> 00:37:24.093]  All I'm saying is, we have the Hillary for Prison shirts.
[00:37:24.934 --> 00:37:26.276]  They sold out faster than I thought.
[00:37:26.636 --> 00:37:28.178]  Version 2, the collector's edition.
[00:37:28.899 --> 00:37:31.002]  We've got smalls and XXLs, and they're gone.
[00:37:31.022 --> 00:37:31.803]  There's a few hundred left.
[00:37:32.143 --> 00:37:32.704]  They're gonna be gone.
[00:37:33.044 --> 00:37:36.048]  An 18-wheeler shows up, made right here in America, Wednesday.
[00:37:37.685 --> 00:37:41.887]  Of course, we sold out because they're 75% off when you buy a second shirt, 50% off when you buy one.
[00:37:42.347 --> 00:37:43.507]  They're at cost at $5.
[00:37:44.247 --> 00:37:47.929]  That's 75% off what they normally are.
[00:37:48.369 --> 00:37:51.950]  So if you want to get those, unfortunately, the three best-selling sizes are sold out.
[00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:54.331]  We'll get more of the new design in.
[00:37:54.431 --> 00:37:56.872]  It's very similar in a few days.
[00:37:57.672 --> 00:37:59.354]  Now, that doesn't really fund the operation.
[00:37:59.374 --> 00:38:04.559]  What funds the operation is the water filtration systems everybody needs at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:38:05.019 --> 00:38:06.240]  10% off promo code WATER.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:07.622]  Nobody should be drinking the tap water.
[00:38:08.703 --> 00:38:09.904]  It's contaminated everywhere.
[00:38:09.924 --> 00:38:11.265]  It's one of the biggest causes of cancer.
[00:38:11.585 --> 00:38:12.386]  Look it up for yourself.
[00:38:12.666 --> 00:38:15.930]  We have the very best spectrum of about eight different brands that I use personally.
[00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:19.673]  Shower filters, the Promax, the AlexaPures, all of them.
[00:38:20.954 --> 00:38:23.156]  10% off promo code water on all those systems.
[00:38:24.137 --> 00:38:28.380]  And we have the Rolls-Royce of deep cleansing back in stock.
[00:38:29.221 --> 00:38:35.966]  One of our best-selling products, but it's very hard to source these and have them at California standards, which are basically almost impossible to pass, but we've done it again.
[00:38:36.946 --> 00:38:39.128]  And we have 20% off deep cleanse.
[00:38:39.468 --> 00:38:40.950]  That's only running for two more days.
[00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:51.534]  It's got concentrated zeolites, organic cilantro, organic milk thistle, fulvic acid, and many other cleansing ingredients, shilajit, you name it, that are known to pull toxins out of the body.
[00:38:52.474 --> 00:38:54.135]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:38:54.495 --> 00:38:56.016]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:38:57.503 --> 00:39:00.204]  But this is such an incredible juncture.
[00:39:00.224 --> 00:39:09.907]  You see our reporters about to be, well, they're actually in the valley now where they admit the UN is running a program bringing refugees in from Latin America with no background check, with TB.
[00:39:10.287 --> 00:39:11.128]  And they had been on the news.
[00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:11.648]  They're illegal.
[00:39:11.808 --> 00:39:15.569]  They're loaded on buses and shipped to Democratic Party facilities around the country to be given ID cards.
[00:39:15.789 --> 00:39:17.550]  That's on ABC News like it's a good thing.
[00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:20.991]  I mean, what you see in Europe is happening here by stealth.
[00:39:22.341 --> 00:39:26.702]  So, our reporters are down there, our reporters are at Bilderberg, our reporters are out in California when folks are being attacked.
[00:39:27.102 --> 00:39:27.883]  I mean, they're everywhere.
[00:39:28.263 --> 00:39:32.904]  We're building a true news organization, and it's your support and spreading the word that's doing it.
[00:39:32.944 --> 00:39:34.685]  So, censorship's coming in.
[00:39:34.705 --> 00:39:37.165]  They're trying to hand the Internet over to the UN right now.
[00:39:37.185 --> 00:39:44.627]  Even though the United States and England, as usual, built it, they are handing it over to the UN and the EU right now.
[00:39:44.827 --> 00:39:46.548]  I mean, that's in the Associated Press.
[00:39:48.536 --> 00:39:50.680]  Internet being handed over to globalists.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:53.364]  I mean, see, the move is happening now.
[00:39:54.105 --> 00:39:56.328]  Now, I'm going to give more remarks on the floor until we end this hour.
[00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:59.854]  I appreciate him coming on on very, very short notice.
[00:40:01.141 --> 00:40:07.124]  His website is scienceandpublicpolicy.org and he's published many of the top peer-reviewed papers in the world.
[00:40:08.024 --> 00:40:11.786]  Some of the top read, in fact the top read paper on climate change in the world is his paper.
[00:40:12.746 --> 00:40:16.388]  That's subscribed to by tens of thousands and they want to arrest him for that.
[00:40:16.988 --> 00:40:18.008]  That is in the news today.
[00:40:18.068 --> 00:40:18.909]  So a true
[00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:35.974]  He doesn't want to hear that, but we need to recognize that the George Washingtons of our time, and there are people like Nigel Farage, there are people like, and you can talk about other folks in England that fought tyranny, and expanding on that, you see Trump coming out.
[00:40:36.194 --> 00:40:40.976]  Trump, Farage, 2016 a lot of folks are saying, globally, just as leadership.
[00:40:41.776 --> 00:40:45.219]  And our countries and our nations and our shared histories coming back together.
[00:40:45.519 --> 00:40:46.760]  Something the globalists hate.
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:48.781]  Our national flags coming back out.
[00:40:49.002 --> 00:40:50.262]  Political correctness under attack.
[00:40:50.683 --> 00:40:52.184]  This is just a great time.
[00:40:52.264 --> 00:40:55.907]  But they're counter striking with the most totalitarian garbage I've ever seen.
[00:40:56.547 --> 00:41:03.893]  And it is now here, the EU, if you just joined us, openly announcing that they're going to go into member states and take over their militaries and not let them leave.
[00:41:04.133 --> 00:41:05.514]  They're using the word super state.
[00:41:05.834 --> 00:41:07.175]  Lord Monckton, you predicted it.
[00:41:07.275 --> 00:41:08.216]  It's now documented.
[00:41:08.976 --> 00:41:09.917]  I am faint of breath.
[00:41:09.957 --> 00:41:10.778]  I mean, I quite frankly,
[00:41:12.488 --> 00:41:14.594]  I don't get butterflies when I'm speaking to a crowd of 10,000 people.
[00:41:14.754 --> 00:41:18.866]  I have butterflies right now because I just feel the history is happening.
[00:41:20.171 --> 00:41:29.537]  History was indeed made by the British people on the 23rd of June, which is already being called Independence Day here in the UK.
[00:41:29.557 --> 00:41:41.484]  And you might like to know, Alex, that the film, Independence Day Resurgence, was very carefully timed so that it premiered in the UK on the 23rd of June, and I've already seen it.
[00:41:41.984 --> 00:41:46.267]  So, there is a great movement afoot now of ordinary people
[00:41:46.767 --> 00:42:12.504]  The moment they get the chance to have their say, and governments in Britain have been trying for decades to deny them the chance to have their say, and in the end it was Nigel Farage, to whom you've quite correctly paid tribute, it was he who for decades has been at the front line battling this, he who transformed UKIP into a useful fighting machine, he who terrified David Cameron so much before the last election,
[00:42:12.984 --> 00:42:33.787]  That Cameron promised us a referendum in the hope of getting just enough votes to win, which he got, but then he had to hold the referendum he promised, and he couldn't win that, because the British people have spoken, and they've spoken decisively enough, 52% to 48%, and as our former Prime Minister William Pitt said,
[00:42:34.608 --> 00:42:44.893]  And he said this just after we'd won the Napoleonic War, a previous victory against an over-mighty totalitarian... I almost mentioned Pitt when I was talking about British-style George Washingtons.
[00:42:44.913 --> 00:42:45.253]  Go ahead.
[00:42:45.913 --> 00:42:54.237]  Well, let's give the quote that he gave in his speech to the Mansion House dinner just before his death.
[00:42:54.277 --> 00:42:55.558]  It was the last speech he made.
[00:42:55.618 --> 00:42:57.819]  It was his shortest and his most eloquent.
[00:42:58.299 --> 00:43:02.621]  All he said was, England has saved herself by her exertions.
[00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:06.683]  And will, as I trust, save Europe by her example.
[00:43:07.364 --> 00:43:22.453]  And I think we are now seen very widely throughout Europe as being the voice of reason and sense and liberty against this increasingly cloying and increasingly aggressive totalitarian EU.
[00:43:23.233 --> 00:43:24.354]  And of course the left,
[00:43:25.194 --> 00:43:28.996]  Which are totalitarian by instinct and by their belief.
[00:43:29.476 --> 00:43:40.721]  They welcome the idea that the likes of you and me, Alex, should be locked up for pointing out that the world is not getting warmer at anything like the rate that the left had predicted.
[00:43:41.042 --> 00:43:49.265]  That the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, effectively a communist organization, they predicted a rate of warming that simply hasn't come to pass.
[00:43:49.325 --> 00:43:50.186]  It's not happening.
[00:43:50.426 --> 00:43:52.087]  So now, here we have
[00:43:52.952 --> 00:44:11.406]  A proposal, again, from the left in the EU, this time to bring forward the proposal for a so-called EU army, by which they make all the armies of the member states into one army, commanded, of course, by the unelected commissars, not answerable to any elected parliament.
[00:44:11.466 --> 00:44:16.330]  So people start saying you're taking over, you're arresting people, you're not letting them have speech, you're tax-exempt.
[00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:18.432]  Their answer is, we're going to take your army over.
[00:44:18.472 --> 00:44:20.053]  I mean, that's true occupation, is it not?
[00:44:20.533 --> 00:44:26.421]  Well, it is indeed, and what we have got here is now a gallop towards formal dictatorship.
[00:44:27.002 --> 00:44:33.931]  And the question is whether there are still enough independent-minded media around to speak out.
[00:44:33.971 --> 00:44:38.477]  You won't hear a word of criticism of this on the BBC, for instance.
[00:44:39.117 --> 00:44:42.419]  And this is a big problem, the media are being captured by these people.
[00:44:42.739 --> 00:44:48.181]  Let me ask you this, because you've worked in media, you've been a top newspaper editor, top advisor to Margaret Thatcher.
[00:44:48.201 --> 00:44:54.624]  This is really a dictatorship openly announcing itself, not since Hitler invaded, in my view, that we've seen a threat this serious.
[00:44:54.684 --> 00:44:58.285]  Not even the Soviet Union, because people knew that's an outside group, it didn't have much of a chance.
[00:44:59.065 --> 00:44:59.966]  But specifically,
[00:45:00.526 --> 00:45:07.053]  The arrogance, the boldness of the left, the radical islamicists, these imams that call for violence, supporting the EU.
[00:45:07.074 --> 00:45:10.958]  I mean, it's really just a crew of motley trash.
[00:45:12.079 --> 00:45:17.726]  Well, what has happened is that the governing class worldwide, the class politique as the French call it,
[00:45:18.246 --> 00:45:22.227]  They have been making common totalitarian cause.
[00:45:22.247 --> 00:45:24.427]  You've got the two kinds of totalitarianism.
[00:45:24.467 --> 00:45:29.848]  The corporatists, who like to be involved with big business and get big business to go along with them.
[00:45:29.888 --> 00:45:30.848]  Those are the fascists.
[00:45:31.268 --> 00:45:34.969]  Then you've got the communists, the open collectivists.
[00:45:35.329 --> 00:45:38.270]  And that, they're now finding common cause for the first time.
[00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:40.390]  They battled each other in the 20th century.
[00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:44.791]  But now, they are standing together against liberty.
[00:45:45.171 --> 00:45:48.173]  And that's the significance of this European army move.
[00:45:48.934 --> 00:45:50.435]  It's that they're so desperate.
[00:45:50.735 --> 00:45:54.157]  They know that the peoples of Europe do not love them.
[00:45:54.978 --> 00:46:01.983]  They know that they have failed to deliver what we would regard as useful European government.
[00:46:02.623 --> 00:46:13.210]  So they are now panicking and saying, how can we cling by the fingernails to this empire of bureaucracy that we have created, even though it's hated by the peoples of Europe?
[00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:19.654]  And the answer, of course, is to get the governing elites of Europe to join together just as they did in trying to bully us.
[00:46:20.254 --> 00:46:24.275]  ...into voting for staying in the European Union, and that failed.
[00:46:24.595 --> 00:46:26.915]  So now they're going to do it by force.
[00:46:27.295 --> 00:46:46.039]  Just as in the United States, as you rightly point out, there's a growing movement, and it's now almost official part of the democratic platform, that anybody who actually comes out and says, hang on a moment, there are serious scientific problems with this climate change nonsense, can be arrested and detained and put on trial for that.
[00:46:46.099 --> 00:46:47.299]  But here's the difficulty.
[00:46:47.939 --> 00:46:58.515]  For as long as they're still talking about putting people on trial, there is at least the chance that you might get a fair trial, because the great thing about a trial is that both sides are heard.
[00:46:58.795 --> 00:47:01.600]  The danger with the European Army proposal...
[00:47:02.595 --> 00:47:10.640]  ...is that there is no court to whom anyone in Europe can appeal if their governing class decides to go down this route.
[00:47:11.001 --> 00:47:29.513]  Because then, that common European army will be established, and let us be quite clear, its aim is not to do what NATO does, to protect the member states of NATO, so that if any one of those states is invaded... Its aim is to keep countries within the system, they admit.
[00:47:29.873 --> 00:47:32.155]  ...this is an internal army,
[00:47:32.855 --> 00:47:43.722]  Designed to suppress the will of the people and keep them cowering in fear and to kick down the door, just like the KGB, if the people disagree with them.
[00:47:44.142 --> 00:47:46.183]  That is what the European Army is about.
[00:47:46.463 --> 00:47:51.206]  That's why they want a European Army as well as NATO.
[00:47:51.486 --> 00:47:54.888]  Because NATO already deals with the external defence of Europe.
[00:47:54.908 --> 00:47:59.471]  It's NATO that's kept the peace and kept the Russians and everybody else at bay.
[00:48:00.583 --> 00:48:03.385]  So why do they need a European Army as well as NATO?
[00:48:03.805 --> 00:48:11.090]  Answer, because NATO is explicitly forbidden to police the internal affairs of member states.
[00:48:11.811 --> 00:48:22.118]  And member states contribute to NATO, it's not commanded by NATO itself, so it goes back to the more Republic strategy, but in a military coalition, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
[00:48:22.138 --> 00:48:24.780]  Now Lord Monckton, we're going to skip this network break so we have more time.
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:28.323]  I wanted to get Kit Daniels briefly, one of our writers that's been writing about this,
[00:48:29.263 --> 00:48:41.451]  And we have another writer, Clifford Cunningham, who wrote about this last week, proposed EU army hidden from British voters until after Brexit, and then right after they bring it out, just showing the amazing stealth of this.
[00:48:41.491 --> 00:48:41.972]  Kit Daniels?
[00:48:42.674 --> 00:48:51.401]  Yes Alex, yesterday, it was on Thursday I believe, I posted this article from our new guy Clifford Cunningham, and now this is before Brexit even happened.
[00:48:51.961 --> 00:49:03.230]  He said that as citizens of the United Kingdom are prepared to cast their votes in a nationwide referendum to decide whether or not to leave the European Union, a plan detailing the initial framework of the creation of the EU army
[00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:06.811]  Is being kept hidden from the public until the day after the vote.
[00:49:07.091 --> 00:49:14.915]  So now the EU bureaucrats are claiming that this whole EU army program is a response to Brexit, but this proves that it was not at all.
[00:49:15.035 --> 00:49:16.495]  They had this plan for months.
[00:49:17.456 --> 00:49:25.219]  But that, exactly, but I mean, isn't it even more outrageous, Lord Monks, and then going back to Kip briefly, Daniels, that their answer is
[00:49:26.818 --> 00:49:27.779]  We're not going to let you leave.
[00:49:27.799 --> 00:49:35.303]  I mean, I'm reading the draft of it and it says, we're going to keep you in, we're one shared common group, basically we're going to make it harder for you to leave.
[00:49:35.363 --> 00:49:40.626]  They're admitting that, hey, you didn't get to vote to enter this, we're unelected and we're going to let you leave.
[00:49:41.207 --> 00:49:56.576]  Now this European army idea has in fact been kicking around for a long time and it's been gathering dust but also gathering momentum among the totalitarian left because they, since the fall of fascism and communism, the left have not had
[00:49:56.596 --> 00:50:05.643]  They've had armies like that of Hitler and of Stalin at their disposal, and so they want, they realise now, they cannot out-argue us.
[00:50:05.803 --> 00:50:09.606]  They cannot speak against democracy and expect to be heard by democracy.
[00:50:09.646 --> 00:50:10.487]  They've tried that.
[00:50:10.867 --> 00:50:19.214]  And even with all the elites backing only one side of the vote, it's the other side, the democratic side, that carried the day in Britain.
[00:50:19.654 --> 00:50:24.857]  So now, although I was born in a democracy, I do not live in one, I shall die in one.
[00:50:25.497 --> 00:50:27.138]  So the British people have won that.
[00:50:27.499 --> 00:50:35.924]  But the response, it's not a response to Brexit, this European army plan, it's been around for actually at least 15 years.
[00:50:35.944 --> 00:50:36.424]  It's amazing.
[00:50:36.724 --> 00:50:38.565]  Gathering momentum all that time.
[00:50:39.086 --> 00:50:52.496]  And as I say, the significance of this European army and the fact that only now are they admitting the latest stage in its development, as they knew perfectly well, that there would be an even larger negative vote against the EU if this came out in public.
[00:50:52.536 --> 00:50:56.059]  This just shows how little they care for how ordinary people think.
[00:50:56.459 --> 00:50:58.141]  Lord Monckton, I want to go back to you in a moment.
[00:50:58.922 --> 00:51:03.551]  I want to go back to you in a moment, but I want to have Kit be able to chime back in one more time because he's been on this beat writing about it.
[00:51:03.851 --> 00:51:06.316]  But then I want to ask you, Monkton, so ruminate on this for about a minute.
[00:51:07.406 --> 00:51:10.628]  You've told us which shoe is going to drop next, years before it happened.
[00:51:10.668 --> 00:51:15.791]  Please tell us what you expect from the EU next, what their scams are going to be, how we counter this.
[00:51:15.831 --> 00:51:32.521]  And do you agree with me that, regardless, it's one of the biggest victories in modern history against totalitarianism, because we force the fact that, yes, we don't get to vote, you're unelected, world government's now out in the open, we've got world leaders like Donald Trump and Nigel Farage talking about megabanks.
[00:51:32.621 --> 00:51:34.182]  I mean, it seems to me this is just
[00:51:35.363 --> 00:51:46.537]  Absolutely devastating events that in the end will sink these people, but just like Hitler didn't know he was beaten at Leningrad or at the Battle of the Bulge in the Ardennes, they're still going to fight on for a while.
[00:51:46.557 --> 00:51:49.601]  So I want to get your take, Lord Monckton, in just a moment.
[00:51:49.721 --> 00:51:50.943]  Finishing up, Kit, other points.
[00:51:51.274 --> 00:51:52.975]  Yeah, I'm working on an article right now, Alex.
[00:51:53.075 --> 00:52:05.939]  I saw CNN yesterday, and they brought in a former ambassador, Christopher Hill, who said, quote, the only way to make Europe more than the sum of member state diplomacies is to make it into a real state.
[00:52:06.339 --> 00:52:13.602]  Multilevel governance may be just about satisfactory for managing mountains of butter, but is barely suitable for making decisions about guns.
[00:52:13.882 --> 00:52:18.524]  And CNN brought this guy on as a, quote, interview, but it's a little more than a propaganda piece.
[00:52:19.315 --> 00:52:22.918]  Let me respond to that and I'll get Lord Monkton's response to my three questions if he can remember them.
[00:52:23.839 --> 00:52:24.079]  Look.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.180]  Again.
[00:52:26.345 --> 00:52:32.267]  You look at the EU, it's always been there to destroy the nation states, get them into debt, and then fold them into the super state.
[00:52:32.567 --> 00:52:34.088]  They wrote about that 50 years ago.
[00:52:34.168 --> 00:52:37.389]  So their conspiracy is public to those that are learned.
[00:52:37.409 --> 00:52:38.690]  It's not debatable.
[00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:43.832]  The problem is the general public now begins to understand that this is a wicked organization.
[00:52:44.412 --> 00:52:48.493]  But how do we take them to the next level to understand it's always been premeditated?
[00:52:49.274 --> 00:52:49.814]  Lord Monckton.
[00:52:51.032 --> 00:53:10.861]  The first thing to do is to understand that this has now become, it didn't start as a premeditated attempt to take away democracy, but it has rapidly become exactly that, as the people who are behind all this realised how feeble the response of nation states would be when they needed to defend themselves.
[00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:23.373]  And already what is happening as a result of this vote is that there are about three and a half to four million signatures on a petition demanding there should be a rerun of the referendum in Britain because they don't like the result.
[00:53:23.413 --> 00:53:30.801]  It'll be just like Denmark and Ireland where they were made to vote again and vote again until they got the result that the governing class wanted.
[00:53:31.261 --> 00:53:34.342]  And only then was that referendum regarded as final.
[00:53:34.602 --> 00:53:38.563]  The same thing is now being attempted even with the British people.
[00:53:38.843 --> 00:53:41.303]  And I can tell you we're not going to like that very much.
[00:53:41.644 --> 00:53:51.466]  We are going to oppose this very vigorously the more the governing establishment tries to discredit and dishonour and not to implement that referendum.
[00:53:51.966 --> 00:54:07.644]  The more strongly the support for freedom will grow among ordinary people, and eventually the Conservative Party, which is deeply divided on this, and half of which still wishes that it could overturn this referendum and simply carry on as though it hadn't happened.
[00:54:07.924 --> 00:54:13.070]  You've got the whole of the Labour Party, which is effectively communist under its present leader, Jeremy Corbyn.
[00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:23.856]  Now in disarray, but the disarray is mainly due to an argument about how far they should push a reversal of the people's will.
[00:54:23.876 --> 00:54:25.977]  Okay, but am I right, though?
[00:54:26.377 --> 00:54:30.560]  The parliamentary bill that will be necessary to break us free of Europe.
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:32.261]  The referendum on its own doesn't do it.
[00:54:32.321 --> 00:54:34.242]  Parliament then has to do the people's will.
[00:54:34.942 --> 00:54:50.992]  And with the likes of the Labour Party and the Scottish National Workers' Party, all these parties that are left-wing, the so-called Liberals, so-called Democrats, who are neither, the so-called Greens, who are the destroyers of the planet, these people, they're all on the far left from
[00:54:51.172 --> 00:55:08.662]  I understand, but long term... They are going to fight and fight and fight to make sure that they will use the majority that they can muster in Parliament, together with a whole lot of conservatives who aren't really conservative at all, to vote down any bill to give effect... So that's their next scam.
[00:55:08.682 --> 00:55:09.762]  Let me ask you this then.
[00:55:09.982 --> 00:55:11.363]  That's going to be the next battle.
[00:55:11.563 --> 00:55:11.783]  Sure.
[00:55:12.384 --> 00:55:14.785]  Let me just brief questions here fast because I want your view on this.
[00:55:16.158 --> 00:55:25.772]  But do you agree with me, though, that the genie's out of the bottle, it's going to be a long fight, but there's no way, I mean, unless it's a total dictatorship, that they're ever going to be able to keep this thing in place.
[00:55:26.073 --> 00:55:28.116]  How long until you think Europe finally falls apart?
[00:55:29.022 --> 00:55:31.063]  The people have spoken here in Britain.
[00:55:31.103 --> 00:55:34.085]  They haven't been allowed to speak almost everywhere else.
[00:55:34.145 --> 00:55:41.228]  Where they have been allowed to speak, they have tended to be told to go and vote again and vote again until they get the answer the elites want.
[00:55:41.528 --> 00:55:43.810]  That technique will no longer work.
[00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:51.534]  There is now a need for something I've mentioned before, which is an international grouping to advance the cause of liberty.
[00:55:51.874 --> 00:55:58.117]  No longer, if we stand alone as national parties, will we be strong enough to defeat... That's my next question about Trump!
[00:55:58.217 --> 00:55:59.439]  You're a totalitarian monster.
[00:55:59.519 --> 00:56:09.075]  You've talked about an open society of governments and peoples working together in shared cause so that the globalists just don't act like they're the only ones trying to have humanity come together.
[00:56:09.336 --> 00:56:10.598]  Why have we given them that power?
[00:56:10.618 --> 00:56:12.080]  We need something to counter that.
[00:56:13.052 --> 00:56:13.412]  We do.
[00:56:13.533 --> 00:56:30.272]  We now need a Freedom International, I don't know what we'll call it, but something like that, which is a subscription membership party, which everybody joins, from America, from Britain, from all the other countries of Europe and the Commonwealth and everywhere else, where liberty still matters.
[00:56:30.652 --> 00:56:36.856]  Because if we don't stand together now, then we'll fall, as I think it was Benjamin Franklin used to say.
[00:56:36.876 --> 00:56:37.636]  We'll hang separate.
[00:56:37.796 --> 00:56:40.798]  We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.
[00:56:40.938 --> 00:56:49.543]  And listen, I mean, Nigel Farage, I mean, I cannot stress in yourself and the rest of the party, you kept coming from nowhere, now the fastest growing party in Europe.
[00:56:50.423 --> 00:56:53.766]  Other parties joining, other parties picking up the nationalist rhetoric.
[00:56:54.427 --> 00:56:55.188]  This is beautiful.
[00:56:55.208 --> 00:56:56.609]  Le Pen, all the rest of it.
[00:56:56.889 --> 00:56:58.571]  I mean, this is clearly rising.
[00:56:58.971 --> 00:57:01.173]  And globally, this could bring in the new renaissance.
[00:57:01.914 --> 00:57:04.937]  Remember that this is not a nationalist movement, UKIP.
[00:57:05.217 --> 00:57:09.261]  What UKIP is, is a democratic, freedom-loving movement.
[00:57:09.821 --> 00:57:14.505]  We are not there to say a nation-state is the only way we can conduct our affairs.
[00:57:14.825 --> 00:57:24.533]  We are there to say that a European super-state that we do not elect and that our people cannot control, that is not the way forward for Europe any more than it is for our country.
[00:57:24.613 --> 00:57:27.975]  Where they arrest people for their speech, where they exempt themselves from taxes.
[00:57:28.015 --> 00:57:29.737]  I mean, it's a new royalty, isn't it?
[00:57:30.489 --> 00:57:31.950]  They exempt themselves from taxes.
[00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:37.713]  Worse, they exempt themselves also from civil suit and from criminal prosecution.
[00:57:38.233 --> 00:57:46.657]  And the people who run the Central Stability Pact... Yeah, tell folks who these new sovereigns are on these bureaucracies and how they set those up, briefly.
[00:57:46.937 --> 00:57:47.658]  I mean, this is amazing.
[00:57:47.678 --> 00:57:50.359]  Well, for instance, the European Stability Pact is a good example.
[00:57:50.639 --> 00:57:57.763]  This is the thing that was intended to address the collapse in the euro, which is still, of course, collapsing and will collapse still faster now that Britain's voted out.
[00:57:58.363 --> 00:58:13.953]  But they set up a governing body of absolute bankers, and these bankers have been given, by the treaty establishing the Stability Pact, total immunity from civil suit or criminal prosecution for any actions they take.
[00:58:14.434 --> 00:58:24.060]  And one of their actions that they are empowered by this treaty to take is to order any member state of the Stability Pact, fortunately not including Britain,
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:28.022]  To hand over any amount of money that they demand.
[00:58:28.042 --> 00:58:28.762]  That's the bail-in.
[00:58:28.782 --> 00:58:29.882]  As soon as they demand it.
[00:58:30.003 --> 00:58:31.923]  And that's how they're able to install leaders, too.
[00:58:31.963 --> 00:58:37.306]  That's how they're able to tell places like Greece or Italy, hey, here's your new leader.
[00:58:37.566 --> 00:58:40.647]  Back in 70 seconds with final comments from Warren Mumpkin and Kit Daniels.
[00:58:40.667 --> 00:58:41.568]  This is so incredible.
[00:58:41.868 --> 00:58:43.529]  World dictatorship is their goal.
[00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:44.969]  I'm telling you, it's amazing.
[00:58:44.989 --> 00:58:46.510]  Stay with us.
[00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:48.591]  Visit GCNlive.com today.

[00:59:41.093 --> 00:59:42.634]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:13.138 --> 01:00:17.619]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.161]  Alright, again, I get upset.
[01:00:26.921 --> 01:00:32.323]  I start hyperventilating when we sit here and see open tyranny being set up and the general public's in a coma.
[01:00:32.843 --> 01:00:42.345]  I don't normally disagree with Lord Monckton because he's one of the leading experts on the EU tyranny and advised Margaret Thatcher on it who opposed going into it and spoke out against it.
[01:00:43.775 --> 01:00:48.199]  I mean, this is an unelected bureaucracy of megabanks taking over countries and stalling leaders.
[01:00:48.239 --> 01:00:51.682]  But just a closing comment from him and then one from Kit Daniels ahead of our next guest.
[01:00:52.202 --> 01:00:55.485]  We're going to Supreme Court rulings and more on Brexit coming up.
[01:00:56.929 --> 01:01:07.478]  I look at the Euro, how they claim they set it up as a steel trade deal, an economic commission and all this, and I've seen some of the leaders of the Euro admit it was set up to consolidate control.
[01:01:07.918 --> 01:01:13.223]  I think it's been a tyranny from the beginning, and certainly is a naked tyranny now.
[01:01:13.243 --> 01:01:15.625]  I mean, why do you say it wasn't started as a tyranny, Lord Monckton?
[01:01:16.929 --> 01:01:28.845]  Originally, at least this was the official declared purpose, let's be clear about this, as a means of, it was called the European Coal and Steel Community, it's job was to make sure there was enough coal and steel to rebuild Europe after the Second World War.
[01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:29.346]  That was it.
[01:01:29.606 --> 01:01:32.110]  That was the Treaty of London in 48 wasn't it?
[01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:34.092]  And then in 56 the Treaty of Rome.
[01:01:34.813 --> 01:01:38.957]  And the Treaty of Rome was where it began to diverge from that original purpose.
[01:01:39.437 --> 01:01:51.708]  And because the treaty that set up the Coal and Steel community was a purely technocratic treaty just to make sure there was enough Coal and Steel to go round, that didn't need to be run democratically.
[01:01:52.228 --> 01:02:09.097]  But the people who then decided they would try and create a European super-state moved in, people like Jean Monnet, and they quite explicitly said, well, we don't want democracy, what we want is the governing elite to come together and form a Europe which we, the dictators, will run.
[01:02:09.217 --> 01:02:12.719]  And by the way, the German president is interrupted.
[01:02:13.199 --> 01:02:17.922]  ...then promptly moved in and tried to do, bureaucratically, what they couldn't do by force of arms.
[01:02:18.462 --> 01:02:21.604]  And that has been the continuing problem with it ever since.
[01:02:22.305 --> 01:02:37.855]  And that is why, in the end, the likes of me, who at first were in favour of the free trade area, which the European Union originally was, when it was just the European Communities, we turned against it when it began galloping towards being the super state that everyone can now see it becoming.
[01:02:38.035 --> 01:02:39.555]  And in closing, let me ask you this question.
[01:02:39.976 --> 01:02:41.116]  Infowars.com story.
[01:02:41.416 --> 01:02:44.337]  German president, there's video, says the elites are not the problem.
[01:02:44.357 --> 01:02:44.877]  This is a quote.
[01:02:45.157 --> 01:02:46.477]  The populations are the problem.
[01:02:46.517 --> 01:02:47.037]  Close quote.
[01:02:47.758 --> 01:02:49.738]  Are these people completely mentally ill?
[01:02:50.058 --> 01:02:51.359]  Why are they so arrogant?
[01:02:51.399 --> 01:02:55.620]  Why do they admit everything about world government, but then have their media say it doesn't exist?
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:03:01.842]  They are so arrogant precisely because the media have been so comprehensively captured.
[01:03:01.902 --> 01:03:12.546]  And if there's one book you need to read to work out how this was done, then it's Ion Mihai Pachapa, who was the head of the Securitate under Ceausescu's Romania.
[01:03:12.966 --> 01:03:22.290]  And he headed the disinformation directorate of the KGB, whose sole function was to denigrate and destroy the reputations of all the enemies of communism throughout Europe.
[01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:27.654]  And they managed to recruit a million European Communists.
[01:03:28.014 --> 01:03:28.374]  That's right.
[01:03:28.394 --> 01:03:35.160]  To help out in... And even after they fell, the brainwashed European Communists have continued the mission.
[01:03:36.021 --> 01:03:42.949]  They have indeed continued the mission, even though Pacheco eventually defected to the West and wrote a book saying that there were a million of them.
[01:03:43.229 --> 01:03:48.135]  When I tell people it was that many, they express shock and they just think I'm some kind of Reds Under the Beds merchant.
[01:03:48.415 --> 01:03:51.318]  But the phrase Reds Under the Beds was invented by Pacheco.
[01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:56.304]  It was invented as part of... Well sure, they declassified a bunch of KGB files a few years ago and it was all documented.
[01:03:56.584 --> 01:04:01.528]  In fact, why don't you review that book for us and come back on and do a full hour about the controlled media in the future.
[01:04:01.889 --> 01:04:03.450]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:04.151]  We salute you.
[01:04:04.191 --> 01:04:06.573]  Congratulations, Lord Monckton, and thank you for your fight.
[01:04:06.613 --> 01:04:14.981]  It's got to feel good to come from nowhere in the last 30 years, and you and Farage and others to be leading a global movement that I just feel honored to be part of, sir, and Trump is as well.
[01:04:15.697 --> 01:04:17.798]  Well, God bless you and thank you for your help, Alex.
[01:04:17.878 --> 01:04:19.019]  It's been absolutely vital.
[01:04:19.479 --> 01:04:19.939]  Well, thank you.
[01:04:19.999 --> 01:04:20.459]  It's amazing.
[01:04:20.499 --> 01:04:21.840]  We're not lying down, that's for sure.
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.361]  Kit, thank you for riding shotgun with us.
[01:04:24.381 --> 01:04:25.502]  More articles at InfoWars.
[01:04:25.742 --> 01:04:27.302]  Quick comment, Kit Daniels?
[01:04:27.322 --> 01:04:28.263]  Well, it's interesting, Alex.
[01:04:28.283 --> 01:04:30.704]  You said earlier that the EU is a Nazi program.
[01:04:31.024 --> 01:04:40.370]  Now it's interesting to point out that the Nazi Germany was not a technocracy, but they did put technocrats in power, and that's what the Trilateral Commission grew out of in the 70s.
[01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:43.192]  You know, you had two separate movements, the U.S.
[01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:45.113]  technocracy and the German technocracy.
[01:04:45.153 --> 01:04:46.995]  The German technocracies would survive.
[01:04:47.055 --> 01:04:47.615]  I think the U.S.
[01:04:48.776 --> 01:04:51.558]  technocracy died in the 30s at the outbreak of World War II.
[01:04:52.438 --> 01:04:57.462]  So yeah, it's like, Adolf Hitler was the last person to create a European super state.
[01:04:57.502 --> 01:04:59.623]  So yeah, this is a Nazi- It's incredible.
[01:04:59.683 --> 01:05:00.163]  Thank you, kid.
[01:05:00.183 --> 01:05:00.884]  Thank you, Lord Mogden.

[01:06:00.001 --> 01:06:09.783]  Both GOP nominee Donald Trump and leftist investor George Soros have predicted the complete downfall of the European Union, despite Trump being a nationalist and Soros a globalist.
[01:06:09.943 --> 01:06:19.611]  The two billionaires both independently declared that they believe a domino effect has been started by Britain's decision to leave the EU, and the process will be difficult for anyone to stop, as reported by Steve Watson.
[01:06:19.771 --> 01:06:20.611]  Soros said, quote,
[01:06:26.536 --> 01:06:34.905]  Trump also predicted a complete breakup of the EU and also warned that the continent would be completely unrecognizable within 10 years if strict immigration controls are not enacted.
[01:06:35.085 --> 01:06:36.306]  Trump told reporters, quote,
[01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:46.036]  Trump is referring to the resistance Scottish politicians are still giving Brexit.
[01:06:46.216 --> 01:06:48.698]  He continued, stating that, For more news, visit InfoWars.com.
[01:06:48.718 --> 01:06:49.780]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[01:07:01.325 --> 01:07:09.754]  Both GOP nominee Donald Trump and leftist investor George Soros have predicted the complete downfall of the European Union, despite Trump being a nationalist and Soros a globalist.
[01:07:09.894 --> 01:07:19.564]  The two billionaires both independently declared that they believe a domino effect has been started by Britain's decision to leave the EU, and the process will be difficult for anyone to stop, as reported by Steve Watson.
[01:07:19.724 --> 01:07:20.585]  Soros said, quote,
[01:07:20.765 --> 01:07:26.308]  Now the catastrophic scenario that many feared has materialized, making the disintegration of the EU practically irreversible.
[01:07:26.488 --> 01:07:34.854]  Trump also predicted a complete breakup of the EU, and also warned that the continent would be completely unrecognizable within 10 years if strict immigration controls are not enacted.
[01:07:35.034 --> 01:07:36.254]  Trump told reporters, quote,
[01:07:42.278 --> 01:07:45.983]  Trump is referring to the resistance Scottish politicians are still giving Brexit.
[01:07:46.163 --> 01:07:48.647]  He continued, stating that, For more news, visit InfoWars.com.
[01:07:48.667 --> 01:07:49.708]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[01:08:04.235 --> 01:08:10.262]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:10.863 --> 01:08:15.909]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:19.414]  In 2007, I shot a whole bunch of videos.
[01:08:19.634 --> 01:08:22.217]  We probably wrote 10, 15 articles, had guests on.
[01:08:23.398 --> 01:08:38.091]  The British Ministry of Defense came out and said that by 2016-2017, they began to believe that global collapse would happen and that hundreds of millions would starve to death, there'd be huge mobs all over the world, basically burning things down.
[01:08:38.791 --> 01:08:39.452]  I didn't say that.
[01:08:40.376 --> 01:08:44.000]  I'm not really a fear porn dealer, but I do respect the British Ministry of Defense.
[01:08:45.001 --> 01:08:48.285]  And a declassified portion of that 23-page report was put out.
[01:08:48.986 --> 01:08:50.247]  The London Guardian picked it up.
[01:08:50.267 --> 01:08:52.690]  The headline was, Flash Mobs and Brain Chips.
[01:08:53.351 --> 01:08:53.972]  In Your Future.
[01:08:55.382 --> 01:08:59.665]  Then about two years later it turned out that was a report on a U.S.
[01:08:59.725 --> 01:09:12.152]  report that in 2009 got partially declassified, saying that global food production and other issues were going to cause a massive deficit that would begin in Africa and the Middle East and cause revolution.
[01:09:12.753 --> 01:09:16.295]  And they predicted it in around the year 2010, which happened right on time.
[01:09:18.032 --> 01:09:21.414]  And then it went on from there to describe the rest of the collapse of the world.
[01:09:22.115 --> 01:09:26.137]  I was attacked by the New York Times, you name it, that I was the fairmonger saying that.
[01:09:26.898 --> 01:09:39.786]  It's like when they have a major publication come out like the Army Times and admit they're doing army drills and we point out, hey, it shows the US, you know, as their target and says Texas hostile.
[01:09:40.186 --> 01:09:42.948]  Is this more conditioning to accept military on the streets?
[01:09:44.735 --> 01:09:47.657]  And then they say that I said they were going to take over a few years ago and kill everybody.
[01:09:47.858 --> 01:09:48.558]  That's not what I'm saying.
[01:09:48.678 --> 01:09:50.720]  I'm saying what they're preparing for.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.481]  And I know a lot of military people.
[01:09:53.802 --> 01:09:54.843]  You see a lot of them on the show.
[01:09:55.604 --> 01:09:57.746]  And they talk about the preparations for civil unrest.
[01:09:57.766 --> 01:10:01.068]  But hey, Vice of HBO has come out and said it.
[01:10:01.749 --> 01:10:04.031]  Oh my gosh, Drugs Report has two links today.
[01:10:04.051 --> 01:10:06.313]  It's up on Infowars.com as well.
[01:10:06.333 --> 01:10:07.714]  And we're going to our guest.
[01:10:08.795 --> 01:10:14.519]  FEMA contractor predicts social unrest caused by 395% food price spikes.
[01:10:14.579 --> 01:10:25.587]  Now, we predicted a 30% spike in the next year, a few months ago, when we offered 30% off, or to 40% off on M4 Select, super high quality, storable food, powered by my Patreon.
[01:10:25.848 --> 01:10:27.649]  We private label to give you the lowest prices.
[01:10:27.689 --> 01:10:31.432]  It's already the lowest prices at its regular price, but we're doing 15% off.
[01:10:31.972 --> 01:10:35.855]  I saw this this morning, and I said, look, this will sell food.
[01:10:35.895 --> 01:10:36.656]  People need food.
[01:10:37.296 --> 01:10:38.477]  And that helps support the broadcast.
[01:10:38.497 --> 01:10:39.017]  It's a win-win.
[01:10:39.037 --> 01:10:40.078]  But I said, this is scary.
[01:10:40.498 --> 01:10:42.219]  And I've read this story several times.
[01:10:42.239 --> 01:10:44.040]  We're going to cover it after Joseph Farah leaves us.
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:45.201]  But the U.S.
[01:10:45.261 --> 01:10:51.185]  national security industry is planning for the impact of an unprecedented global food crisis lasting as long as a decade.
[01:10:51.225 --> 01:10:53.466]  That is the exact Pentagon report, 2006.
[01:10:54.247 --> 01:10:55.227]  British report, 2007.
[01:10:55.807 --> 01:11:00.430]  According to reports by government contractor, the studies published by the CNA Corporation, December 2015.
[01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:02.031]  Oh, you just learned that now.
[01:11:02.552 --> 01:11:03.532]  Unreported until now.
[01:11:04.833 --> 01:11:08.374]  Detailed simulation of protracted global food crisis, and it goes on.
[01:11:09.955 --> 01:11:13.696]  Yeah, and it all starts in 2016, 2017, accelerates through 2020 to 2030.
[01:11:14.096 --> 01:11:16.337]  We broke this.
[01:11:16.997 --> 01:11:18.238]  We've basically broken everything.
[01:11:18.998 --> 01:11:20.839]  And guess who else has broken all this?
[01:11:21.039 --> 01:11:22.259]  WorldNetDaily.com.
[01:11:22.299 --> 01:11:23.840]  And listen, I don't get paid to say that.
[01:11:24.915 --> 01:11:31.025]  Joseph Farah, when they got the, and I'm not, cause he hates this, he wants to come on and cover it, and he says, please don't talk about me, he said this before Alex, but I'm gonna do it.
[01:11:31.826 --> 01:11:36.654]  Cause I gotta just call out these heroes, like Drudge, and Ward Monckton, and Martin Moreno, and others.
[01:11:39.315 --> 01:11:57.129]  When they did a FOIA request last year and got the thousands of pages from the Clinton Foundation, from the Clinton Library, it was all how to stop the new press in the future, how to stop Joseph Farah and the Western Journalism Center, because if Joseph Farah succeeds, it'll change the face of media and there'll be new independent media.
[01:11:57.449 --> 01:11:59.090]  We've got to block liberals and conservatives.
[01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:00.472]  We've got to call them conspiracy theorists.
[01:12:00.832 --> 01:12:02.193]  Order the controlled media to do that.
[01:12:02.473 --> 01:12:07.097]  So we literally are getting the guy on that led the way to what
[01:12:08.228 --> 01:12:10.789]  Drudge was able to do what we've done and what you're able to do.
[01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:14.031]  Some people say, well I hope Drudge gets shut down by the Federal Elections Commission.
[01:12:14.071 --> 01:12:14.572]  I hope you do.
[01:12:14.832 --> 01:12:15.472]  I'll get bigger.
[01:12:15.752 --> 01:12:17.153]  No, they'll shut you down too.
[01:12:17.213 --> 01:12:19.354]  And now they're handing the internet over to the UN.
[01:12:19.414 --> 01:12:20.695]  That's in the Washington Post today.
[01:12:21.375 --> 01:12:24.857]  So all I'm saying is everything we warned of is epically now happening.
[01:12:25.118 --> 01:12:34.443]  So I want to ask Joseph Farah, in the limited time we have, he's a busy guy, I want to cover Brexit, I want to cover Trump with him, talk to one of the wise men out there, a true patriot,
[01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:50.405]  What point have we gotten to, Joseph, WND.com, where everything we've talked about is now admitted, our credibility is exploding, but instead the globalist left just says they're going to arrest everybody, and the Democratic platform now says arrest climate change deniers.
[01:12:50.505 --> 01:12:52.667]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:12:52.768 --> 01:12:53.588]  It's bizarre.
[01:12:54.009 --> 01:12:54.890]  What is going on?
[01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:56.011]  Where do you think this is going?
[01:12:57.598 --> 01:13:03.499]  Well, it's not going in a good direction, that's for sure, Alex, and thank you very much for having me on, by the way.
[01:13:03.519 --> 01:13:04.259]  I appreciate it.
[01:13:04.299 --> 01:13:05.780]  We haven't visited for a while.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.240]  Oh, I had to twist your arm, let's be honest.
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.321]  I didn't think you liked me anymore.
[01:13:11.781 --> 01:13:15.001]  But, you know, we're in a world of hurt.
[01:13:15.201 --> 01:13:16.922]  I mean, I don't know what else to say.
[01:13:17.082 --> 01:13:19.582]  I mean, there's not much good news on the horizon.
[01:13:20.102 --> 01:13:24.823]  We look for it every day so people don't go insane, but it is hard to find.
[01:13:26.038 --> 01:13:27.798]  You know, I think you're talking about good news.
[01:13:28.959 --> 01:13:34.420]  You know, I think what we saw happen in Great Britain last week was some good news.
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:49.803]  I think the people, and it's not just people in the United States obviously, are beginning to see so much of the kinds of things that we've been talking about, the terrible direction we've been going in, and they're reacting as best they can.
[01:13:49.863 --> 01:13:51.003]  The question is whether
[01:13:51.670 --> 01:13:56.753]  You know, the ruling authorities are going to pay attention to the will of the people.
[01:13:57.273 --> 01:14:01.936]  We've got an election coming up this year, I think, as far as that goes.
[01:14:01.956 --> 01:14:12.142]  You know, in the past, you could argue whether there was a dime's worth of difference between the Republican nominee and the Democratic nominee.
[01:14:12.182 --> 01:14:13.663]  We talked about that in 2004, 2008, and 2012.
[01:14:20.574 --> 01:14:22.475]  And, you know, it was arguable.
[01:14:23.336 --> 01:14:24.916]  It's not even arguable.
[01:14:25.357 --> 01:14:25.677]  It's not.
[01:14:26.257 --> 01:14:32.860]  In this election, there's trillions of dollars worth of difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:33.460]  Would you agree?
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:36.322]  Oh, there is light years of difference.
[01:14:36.342 --> 01:14:39.383]  And we see the establishment showing that.
[01:14:39.483 --> 01:14:40.684]  I mean, they're so afraid.
[01:14:40.744 --> 01:14:42.025]  Why are they so afraid of Trump?
[01:14:43.165 --> 01:14:44.726]  Because he cannot be controlled.
[01:14:45.276 --> 01:14:51.300]  I mean, this is a guy who, when he talks to the American people, they listen.
[01:14:53.101 --> 01:14:55.222]  The media cannot control this guy.
[01:14:55.262 --> 01:14:58.764]  When I say he can't be controlled, I'm really talking about the media, because what are they going to do?
[01:14:59.065 --> 01:15:00.646]  They have to stop covering him.
[01:15:00.806 --> 01:15:02.567]  They have to stop putting him on TV.
[01:15:02.807 --> 01:15:05.368]  That hurts their ratings when they do that.
[01:15:05.809 --> 01:15:07.450]  Now you're hitting them right in the bottom line.
[01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:12.153]  And this is what is so spectacular, I think, about this election.
[01:15:12.473 --> 01:15:13.974]  It's such a quantum
[01:15:14.804 --> 01:15:20.025]  Different from the recent elections we've seen over many, many years.
[01:15:20.685 --> 01:15:24.966]  And he does know his timing because all over the world nationalists and patriots are getting in.
[01:15:25.226 --> 01:15:27.367]  There's a populist surge, so that was my earlier question.
[01:15:27.707 --> 01:15:36.329]  The paradox of huge global awakening, world government out in the open, totalitarian, and so people are really waking up, but at the same time the left
[01:15:36.949 --> 01:15:42.773]  He's re-entrenching and just getting more violent, more bizarre, more mentally ill, more anti-free speech.
[01:15:42.813 --> 01:15:48.097]  I mean, you know I've been a big critic of the Republicans, just like you've been, and some fake conservatives.
[01:15:48.437 --> 01:15:51.900]  But with the left, it seems like they've collectively gone completely insane.
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:53.280]  Well, that's the danger.
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:56.663]  We've always seen the totalitarian nature.
[01:15:57.681 --> 01:16:01.384]  Uh, of this, you know, movement that is, they call themselves progressives.
[01:16:02.044 --> 01:16:09.169]  I love that, but that, uh, between quotes, uh, you know, what, what are they progressing toward is the big question.
[01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:17.455]  And, um, you know, but ultimately they're, we're seeing like never before the totalitarian nature of the left.
[01:16:17.675 --> 01:16:19.937]  And so we're living in very dangerous times here.
[01:16:20.566 --> 01:16:31.333]  We're seeing, you know, at the same time we see the expression in Great Britain against globalism, for independence, for accountability from government.
[01:16:32.093 --> 01:16:39.918]  We also see, you know, I'll just point to a headline today, the Supreme Court overturns a case in Texas.
[01:16:40.099 --> 01:16:44.481]  I wanted to bring that up to you, and then they say, oh, when it's a split court, it leans left.
[01:16:44.741 --> 01:16:50.005]  So Scalia's magically out of the way, and now here's Kennedy again shooting down state laws.
[01:16:50.792 --> 01:16:52.113]  What was going on in Texas?
[01:16:52.173 --> 01:16:56.655]  Now, I don't care whether you're pro-life, pro-abortion, whatever.
[01:16:57.896 --> 01:17:12.183]  The question on the table is, does Texas have the right, the power as a state, a sovereign state, to require certain health and safety standards regarding abortion clinics?
[01:17:12.723 --> 01:17:14.184]  That seems to me to be a no-brainer.
[01:17:14.204 --> 01:17:17.746]  Yeah, there's more regulations on a Baskin-Robbins than there is an abortuary.
[01:17:18.626 --> 01:17:19.507]  Exactly right!
[01:17:19.967 --> 01:17:21.989]  And so the Supreme Court knows better.
[01:17:23.051 --> 01:17:27.135]  How is that even... You know, it just defies all logic.
[01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:28.957]  And we've seen this over and over again.
[01:17:29.337 --> 01:17:31.920]  You know, the totalitarian nature of this court.
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.922]  It's manifest.
[01:17:36.605 --> 01:17:42.612]  And so, you know, we're in the same position, maybe even in a worse position, than the British people were.
[01:17:43.012 --> 01:17:49.099]  And, you know, it's not because we're necessarily part of a European Union-style situation.
[01:17:49.139 --> 01:17:51.142]  No, it's that our tyranny is the Supreme Court!
[01:17:51.682 --> 01:17:54.927]  That's right, we're under the control of Washington D.C.
[01:17:55.007 --> 01:17:56.068]  Washington D.C.
[01:17:56.188 --> 01:18:01.816]  is acting sovereign over the states and over local jurisdictions and so forth.
[01:18:02.397 --> 01:18:05.321]  It's just, it's, the situation is untenable.
[01:18:06.202 --> 01:18:07.664]  Serena, Washington exit.
[01:18:08.815 --> 01:18:09.395]  Mm-hmm.
[01:18:09.495 --> 01:18:10.135]  How do we do it?
[01:18:10.595 --> 01:18:11.876]  Is there a mechanism for that?
[01:18:12.436 --> 01:18:14.036]  It's called the Constitution.
[01:18:14.116 --> 01:18:15.117]  That's the mechanism.
[01:18:15.257 --> 01:18:16.477]  But they just ignore it.
[01:18:16.897 --> 01:18:23.118]  I mean, the Constitution strictly limits the power of the federal government, but we don't see that.
[01:18:24.059 --> 01:18:27.179]  And what about the checks and balances in the system?
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:31.621]  You know, isn't it supposed to be the legislative branch that makes the laws?
[01:18:32.001 --> 01:18:37.582]  How often do we see this president effectively making laws, issuing edicts?
[01:18:38.174 --> 01:18:39.598]  To, you know, all 50 states.
[01:18:47.355 --> 01:19:09.003]  Where the United Nations, here's the headline, I'm grabbing it out of the stack, UN, this is ABC News, KRGV, more Central Americans headed to the U.S., and they admit they're here illegally, the UN's running the program in Central America, they have a deal with Mexico, they ship them up here illegally, and then they put them on buses inside the U.S., and then ship them to Democratic Party facilities.
[01:19:09.343 --> 01:19:11.284]  This is what we broke two years ago with our reporters.
[01:19:12.384 --> 01:19:13.845]  They're coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:19:14.105 --> 01:19:14.846]  They're in McAllen.
[01:19:15.246 --> 01:19:16.907]  I mean, the Supreme Court ruled to stop it.
[01:19:16.927 --> 01:19:17.768]  He's violating the law.
[01:19:18.068 --> 01:19:21.109]  So when he doesn't like what the Supreme Court says, he ignores it.
[01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:23.051]  But when he does like it, he goes for it.
[01:19:23.751 --> 01:19:23.971]  Right.
[01:19:24.251 --> 01:19:24.912]  Exactly right.
[01:19:25.292 --> 01:19:27.273]  And you talk about the immigration issue.
[01:19:27.313 --> 01:19:33.016]  This is ultimately, I think, what was the real catalyst behind this Brexit vote.
[01:19:33.717 --> 01:19:34.617]  And here we are.
[01:19:35.398 --> 01:19:35.798]  Are we in
[01:19:36.519 --> 01:19:37.860]  Better shape than they are?
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:38.901]  Or worse shape?
[01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:48.546]  The only thing we're going to be able to do, honestly, from a pragmatic, political standpoint, is to elect Donald Trump in 2016.
[01:19:49.507 --> 01:19:58.413]  You know, I can't say, as I may have once suggested to people, that it makes a heck of a big difference who we elect to Congress.
[01:19:58.453 --> 01:20:00.194]  We did that in 2010.
[01:20:00.554 --> 01:20:02.175]  How did that work out for us?
[01:20:02.395 --> 01:20:04.716]  I was about to say, you and I admitted our failure.
[01:20:05.577 --> 01:20:13.461]  We were so sick of George W. Bush as more libertarian patriots that we sat out the 2008 election because McCain was so horrible.
[01:20:14.561 --> 01:20:16.322]  But now look at what we've got.
[01:20:16.342 --> 01:20:18.823]  McCain knew he was a shill.
[01:20:18.863 --> 01:20:21.625]  He knew he was a fall guy like a Don King boxing match.
[01:20:21.745 --> 01:20:22.825]  He was there to take a dive.
[01:20:23.345 --> 01:20:27.047]  But we should have just still elected that puppet because he's an old evil white guy.
[01:20:27.067 --> 01:20:28.728]  He wouldn't have had the race car to play.
[01:20:28.748 --> 01:20:30.189]  He couldn't have got any of this done.
[01:20:31.111 --> 01:20:31.632]  Exactly.
[01:20:31.912 --> 01:20:34.354]  I mean, you know, in retrospect, who knows?
[01:20:35.175 --> 01:20:36.476]  But the point is this.
[01:20:36.716 --> 01:20:41.760]  You know, what we need is not just shaking up Washington by electing a president.
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:50.147]  We've got to actually create, or recreate, an alternative political party in Washington.
[01:20:50.187 --> 01:20:53.150]  And that's what I think Trump is uniquely positioned to do.
[01:20:54.131 --> 01:20:56.554]  Uh, and you know, let me ask you a question, Alex.
[01:20:56.914 --> 01:21:03.722]  Do you believe these polls that are coming out now, you know, that he's 10 points behind Hillary and so forth?
[01:21:03.822 --> 01:21:05.084]  What does your gut tell you?
[01:21:05.584 --> 01:21:08.628]  I had a 30-minute conversation with Roger Stowe yesterday.
[01:21:10.151 --> 01:21:10.471]  Quizzing
[01:21:31.690 --> 01:21:31.950]  I think so.
[01:21:48.716 --> 01:21:50.739]  People ask why is the left out stabbing people?
[01:21:51.019 --> 01:21:51.940]  Why are they out attacking?
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:54.463]  Why are they beating up old ladies when it makes them look so bad?
[01:21:54.503 --> 01:21:55.104]  They don't care.
[01:21:55.444 --> 01:21:57.987]  They want to scare you away from coming out to vote.
[01:21:58.388 --> 01:22:01.111]  They want to scare you from saying you're for Trump.
[01:22:01.691 --> 01:22:02.532]  They've done their numbers.
[01:22:02.552 --> 01:22:03.493]  They've done their actuaries.
[01:22:03.533 --> 01:22:04.234]  So the truth is
[01:22:05.375 --> 01:22:26.785]  From the polls they've done in focus groups, they're thinking upwards of 10 to 14 percentage of people, whether they be Democrat or Republicans or non-voters, folks that have been out of the system for a while, that really Trump's going to win with a Reagan-style landslide, but they think Hillary is just trying to act like she's really winning and having the media say it because they're looking at probably stealing the election.
[01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:32.173]  Well, that is exactly what I have been saying now for some time.
[01:22:32.713 --> 01:22:39.017]  I believe that Trump can cause a political realignment in this country like we haven't seen since 1980.
[01:22:39.937 --> 01:22:46.901]  And I don't base it on the polls, because with the polls you've got to actually see how they were pushing it.
[01:22:46.921 --> 01:22:49.182]  But also, exactly, people are scared to say they're for Trump.
[01:22:49.202 --> 01:22:50.203]  That's why I wear a hat.
[01:22:50.783 --> 01:22:56.249]  Donald Trump hat when I'm downtown around communist areas because I want to get it in their face and they run in fear.
[01:22:56.710 --> 01:22:58.712]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:22:58.972 --> 01:22:59.273]  Right.
[01:23:00.013 --> 01:23:02.917]  My opinion has been based on the anecdotal
[01:23:03.904 --> 01:23:05.925]  We all have family like that.
[01:23:22.871 --> 01:23:23.311]  For Trump.
[01:23:23.512 --> 01:23:24.833]  Can't wait to vote for Trump.
[01:23:24.873 --> 01:23:33.940]  And this has caused, I don't know what it is about Donald Trump, and honestly, because I wish I had that magic to do it with my own sister, right?
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:49.692]  And I see this over and over with people, not just my relatives, people I run into who, you know, you would think or you have reason to believe that they are Democrats, liberals, progressives, what have you.
[01:23:50.072 --> 01:23:52.736]  And this is a whole different ballgame for them.
[01:23:52.877 --> 01:24:01.851]  Trump, the personality Trump, because of his outspokenness, his forthrightness, and look at that speech he gave about Hillary.
[01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.810]  Last week.
[01:24:03.551 --> 01:24:05.332]  I mean, that was amazing.
[01:24:05.692 --> 01:24:12.496]  That proves he's for real, that he's so hardcore, that shows he is definitely not a shill for Hillary.
[01:24:12.536 --> 01:24:13.156]  We know that now.
[01:24:13.396 --> 01:24:23.822]  Have we seen a Republican presidential candidate go on the attack and it was not personal, it was not, everything he said in that speech was
[01:24:24.369 --> 01:24:26.392]  Dead accurate.
[01:24:27.033 --> 01:24:31.099]  You could have been listening to Alex Jones or Joseph Barra give that speech.
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:32.201]  That's what we've got.
[01:24:32.381 --> 01:24:35.686]  Now look, I'm not saying Donald Trump is perfect.
[01:24:36.267 --> 01:24:39.692]  I didn't even support him personally.
[01:24:40.152 --> 01:24:41.834]  I thought it was a Ted Cruz guy.
[01:24:59.884 --> 01:25:07.446]  And you have to admit, I think, just objectively, that he is in the best position to challenge this woman.
[01:25:07.486 --> 01:25:12.107]  Because he will tell you exactly what she is.
[01:25:12.487 --> 01:25:17.328]  That's why I say it's not a dime's worth of difference this time.
[01:25:17.828 --> 01:25:20.149]  It's trillions and trillions of dollars.
[01:25:20.209 --> 01:25:27.591]  It's probably the last chance we have to elect a president that's going to give us the chance
[01:25:29.966 --> 01:25:32.708]  Not just to change direction, but to do a 180.
[01:25:33.449 --> 01:25:35.430]  And I really believe that's the opportunity.
[01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:36.591]  And that's why they're so scared of him.
[01:25:36.611 --> 01:25:41.675]  That's why they say he's unelectable, couldn't get the nomination, blah blah blah, because they know he's the best candidate.
[01:25:41.995 --> 01:25:45.558]  Their fear shows us that something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
[01:25:45.578 --> 01:25:57.907]  Let me ask you this question, because obviously you're a smart news guy who had the instincts to envision the whole internet resistance, the whole nine yards, when the founding fathers of the current wave of liberty worldwide, Joseph Farah, joining us here today on WND.com.
[01:25:59.768 --> 01:26:01.068]  What do we hammer on most?
[01:26:01.248 --> 01:26:05.350]  I don't think there's been enough talk about how she sold us out to the Communist Chinese with the missile secrets.
[01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:06.250]  Let me just throw that out at you.
[01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:07.030]  What about this?
[01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:19.673]  What about hammering the point that, I know you've done this, but I mean, that she gets a hundred million dollars from Gulf states that keep women as prisoners, but then runs and executes homosexuals, then she runs around to gay pride parades.
[01:26:19.754 --> 01:26:21.174]  I mean, the hypocrisy.
[01:26:21.214 --> 01:26:23.294]  What about hammering her Brian Williams moment?
[01:26:23.695 --> 01:26:28.616]  What do we do to reach out to her idiot supporters and get them out of their stupid trance?
[01:26:29.076 --> 01:26:35.282]  I think that, again, that speech by Trump was so perfectly crafted to do just that.
[01:26:35.522 --> 01:26:43.189]  To turn people who, you know, out of anger or whatever, maybe ignorance, supported Bernie Sanders, you know, in the primaries.
[01:26:43.530 --> 01:26:45.632]  But they know what Hillary is.
[01:26:46.152 --> 01:26:50.336]  They know she is as corrupt as anybody who's ever run for president before.
[01:26:51.097 --> 01:26:54.160]  And, you know, if they're going to vote at all.
[01:26:55.158 --> 01:26:59.944]  I think a lot of them, and the polls even show this, that a lot of them will turn to Trump.
[01:27:00.404 --> 01:27:04.108]  That's why I say I think we're looking at a major realignment here.
[01:27:04.909 --> 01:27:09.274]  It will not hurt, you know, a lot of, I've got a lot of friends, even relatives who work
[01:27:09.901 --> 01:27:14.245]  In government, in Washington, you know, under the dome.
[01:27:14.966 --> 01:27:17.148]  And they're worried about, you know, losing Congress.
[01:27:17.428 --> 01:27:19.891]  I think Trump's going to help every Republican.
[01:27:19.991 --> 01:27:20.211]  I agree.
[01:27:20.231 --> 01:27:23.914]  Let me ask, in the time we have left, what happens if they steal the election from him?
[01:27:24.415 --> 01:27:29.640]  I mean, don't they know he's just a manifestation of rising nationalism, populism, and disgust with corruption?
[01:27:30.273 --> 01:27:36.897]  Well, he's the biggest fear that Washington insiders of both parties have.
[01:27:37.397 --> 01:27:43.781]  That, again, confirms for me that we're on the right track here with Donald Trump.
[01:27:43.801 --> 01:27:46.302]  I totally agree, but what happens if they do steal the election from him?
[01:27:47.243 --> 01:27:49.984]  Well, I mean, if they steal the election from him, it's all over.
[01:27:50.004 --> 01:27:52.206]  I mean, you know, America's over.
[01:27:53.166 --> 01:27:54.067]  Quite honestly, right?
[01:27:54.327 --> 01:27:55.408]  What can I do?
[01:27:55.428 --> 01:27:57.289]  I agree, that's not rhetoric.
[01:27:57.329 --> 01:27:59.350]  We've really reached the point where it's do or die.
[01:27:59.912 --> 01:28:00.132]  Yeah.
[01:28:00.473 --> 01:28:01.654]  Oh, no question about it.
[01:28:02.836 --> 01:28:04.938]  I want to ask you another question.
[01:28:04.998 --> 01:28:06.901]  I love interviewing you on your own show.
[01:28:07.321 --> 01:28:08.863]  What do you make of this?
[01:28:09.103 --> 01:28:09.984]  I'm sure you've seen it.
[01:28:10.525 --> 01:28:11.386]  This U.N.
[01:28:11.466 --> 01:28:14.690]  military convoys all over the country.
[01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:18.395]  Now they're in Virginia, but of course we've seen them in many, many other states.
[01:28:19.285 --> 01:28:19.886]  Over the years.
[01:28:20.367 --> 01:28:21.968]  What do you make of this?
[01:28:22.008 --> 01:28:23.310]  What is going on that we don't know?
[01:28:37.785 --> 01:28:45.490]  It's bizarre, and now all the news, it's the UN says this, the UN says that, the UN's bringing in refugees to Texas, the UN's going to watch our police departments.
[01:28:45.951 --> 01:28:51.694]  I think they're getting ready for a total collapse, and maybe states not being part of the union, and I think they're getting ready for civil war too.
[01:28:51.934 --> 01:29:02.361]  I'm not saying it's coming, Joseph, but when they've got battle tanks being brought into the US, being shipped in, not out, you know, Abrams tanks with the UN on the side, something this way wicked comes.
[01:29:02.381 --> 01:29:03.322]  We'd be idiots not to think so.
[01:29:03.342 --> 01:29:03.702]  What do you think?
[01:29:04.491 --> 01:29:05.491]  Well, absolutely.
[01:29:05.572 --> 01:29:09.213]  I mean, you have to ask yourself, what are the alternative theories?
[01:29:10.434 --> 01:29:11.574]  I can't think of any.
[01:29:11.914 --> 01:29:13.775]  That's the scary thing.
[01:29:14.055 --> 01:29:15.536]  And you mentioned earlier the U.N.
[01:29:15.596 --> 01:29:19.578]  role in, you know, the border and immigration from the southern border.
[01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:21.299]  But it is the U.N.
[01:29:21.579 --> 01:29:26.221]  that is also determining where these so-called Syrian refugees go.
[01:29:26.952 --> 01:29:30.015]  And they could activate them to start rioting, just like they've done in Europe, and use that.
[01:29:30.035 --> 01:29:35.599]  I mean, these are brand new Hunger Games giant-style armored vehicles being shipped around the U.S.
[01:29:35.639 --> 01:29:36.700]  in cash.
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:37.401]  We've got to cover this.
[01:29:37.421 --> 01:29:40.183]  Joseph Farah, WND.com, thank you so much for coming on.
[01:29:40.724 --> 01:29:41.825]  All right, keep the faith, buddy.
[01:29:42.345 --> 01:29:43.466]  Wow, he just brought up that topic.
[01:29:43.506 --> 01:29:44.107]  I need to cover that.
[01:29:44.127 --> 01:29:48.771]  We're going to cover that when we come back, along with the food shortage issue.
[01:29:48.791 --> 01:29:49.832]  395% global food shortage.
[01:29:50.032 --> 01:29:50.872]  That's from FEMA.
[01:29:52.096 --> 01:29:52.779]  This is hardcore!
[01:30:01.903 --> 01:30:03.824]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[01:30:03.864 --> 01:30:04.944]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:30:05.204 --> 01:30:06.125]  Why is this so good?
[01:30:06.405 --> 01:30:11.646]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:30:11.727 --> 01:30:25.291]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:30:25.331 --> 01:30:26.732]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:30:27.492 --> 01:30:29.074]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:30:29.154 --> 01:30:31.636]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:30:31.737 --> 01:30:32.998]  These are all parasites.
[01:30:33.038 --> 01:30:34.139]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:30:34.159 --> 01:30:35.200]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:42.107]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, you have enzyme blend in there.
[01:30:42.147 --> 01:30:47.353]  This is very important because a lot of these microorganisms, and even going up to tapeworms, pinworms,
[01:30:47.893 --> 01:30:50.076]  You have to disintegrate the lining.
[01:30:50.096 --> 01:30:55.102]  I mean, on viruses that protect themselves, and so do bacteria and protozoa and mycoplasms.
[01:30:55.503 --> 01:30:59.748]  They have a protective shell that a lot of times the immune system can't even get into.
[01:30:59.929 --> 01:31:00.970]  Our own immune system.
[01:31:01.531 --> 01:31:04.234]  Especially since most people's immune system are weak anyway.
[01:31:04.955 --> 01:31:15.865]  So we actually design the Living Defense and put in a specific blend of enzymes which actually chew and eat through the lining of these different organisms.
[01:31:16.445 --> 01:31:18.087]  So the Living Defense is amazing.
[01:31:18.507 --> 01:31:20.569]  We've seen just tremendous reviews.
[01:31:21.249 --> 01:31:23.411]  How often should you take Living Defense?
[01:31:23.491 --> 01:31:24.792]  I mean, is it a regimen every day?
[01:31:24.852 --> 01:31:26.674]  That's what I was doing until we ran out.
[01:31:27.014 --> 01:31:28.736]  Or do you do it heavier for certain cleanses?
[01:31:28.756 --> 01:31:29.557]  What do you do, Dr. Group?
[01:31:30.259 --> 01:31:41.852]  Well, I do usually six weeks at a time because if you look at the life cycle of most parasites, it's six weeks from the time... So you've got to kill the ones that are in there and then kill their babies when the eggs hatch up.
[01:31:42.152 --> 01:31:52.043]  If you're suffering from abdominal pain, allergies, even like headaches, anemia, weakened immune system, gut problems, depression, hair loss,
[01:31:53.103 --> 01:31:55.585]  Excess gas, muscle pain, nervousness.
[01:31:55.645 --> 01:31:56.686]  I mean, all these things.
[01:31:56.966 --> 01:31:58.067]  Doctors don't know.
[01:31:58.147 --> 01:32:01.770]  They don't teach doctors in medical school about parasites and harmful organisms.
[01:32:01.810 --> 01:32:03.931]  There's a reason why they don't teach them about that.
[01:32:04.012 --> 01:32:09.996]  Just like they don't teach doctors about the root cause of disease and how to eliminate all disease out there.
[01:32:10.056 --> 01:32:11.437]  They don't want you to know about it.
[01:32:11.697 --> 01:32:14.399]  You don't want your own immune system being attacked.
[01:32:14.679 --> 01:32:18.062]  Again, you know, you have animals, especially your cats, dogs.
[01:32:18.102 --> 01:32:19.963]  So many people have pets these days.
[01:32:20.424 --> 01:32:21.765]  People eat raw sushi.
[01:32:22.225 --> 01:32:23.827]  People eat more raw food.
[01:32:23.887 --> 01:32:28.112]  You have all these different organisms showing up in the water supplies now.
[01:32:28.592 --> 01:32:31.936]  You even have it in the air supplies, these tiny microorganisms.
[01:32:31.976 --> 01:32:34.820]  So it's not like we can get away from them.
[01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:36.341]  We just have to do everything.
[01:32:36.422 --> 01:32:38.164]  I recommend doing a parasite test.
[01:32:38.644 --> 01:32:40.084]  Plans at least twice a year.
[01:32:40.225 --> 01:32:43.285]  All right, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:32:43.305 --> 01:32:44.306]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:32:44.366 --> 01:32:44.906]  Living Defense.
[01:32:45.206 --> 01:32:46.246]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:46.306 --> 01:32:47.347]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:32:47.587 --> 01:32:49.427]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:32:50.048 --> 01:32:51.928]  And you support the broadcast.
[01:32:51.988 --> 01:32:53.069]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:53.329 --> 01:32:55.229]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:32:55.609 --> 01:32:57.550]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:33:04.906 --> 01:33:08.956]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:09.818 --> 01:33:11.342]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:38.314 --> 01:33:41.297]  You'll take my life, but I'll take yours, too!
[01:33:41.377 --> 01:33:44.420]  You'll find your musket, but I'll run you through!
[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:48.063]  So when you're waiting for the next attack, you better stop!
[01:33:54.418 --> 01:33:55.939]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[01:33:56.219 --> 01:33:56.539]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:56.699 --> 01:33:57.179]  Central.
[01:33:57.239 --> 01:33:59.520]  We're here broadcasting worldwide.
[01:34:00.541 --> 01:34:01.201]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:34:01.621 --> 01:34:12.246]  I'm promoting free market, open societies, based on free will and free association, and based on human instinct, human spirit, and basic common sense.
[01:34:14.006 --> 01:34:17.888]  That is all 180 degrees the opposite of what the globalists are pushing.
[01:34:19.568 --> 01:34:24.210]  You know, I remember having Dr. Blaylock on like 20 years ago, top brain surgeon.
[01:34:24.230 --> 01:34:26.131]  He was still a brain surgeon at the time before he retired.
[01:34:26.151 --> 01:34:34.654]  All these other experts on, saying low-fat diets are causing Alzheimer's and brain damage and heart disease.
[01:34:35.134 --> 01:34:36.074]  And they had studies then.
[01:34:36.094 --> 01:34:37.095]  I remember my dad saying it.
[01:34:37.795 --> 01:34:42.257]  It was trans fats, artificial fats, burnt fats that are bad.
[01:34:43.397 --> 01:34:45.778]  Oh, but now it was in the New York Times last week.
[01:34:45.818 --> 01:34:47.658]  I have the article and the Huffington Post.
[01:34:47.778 --> 01:34:48.398]  Oh my gosh!
[01:34:48.938 --> 01:34:54.680]  Women need more complex fats because it's good for their skin and your brain.
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:57.061]  Oh my, let's give them a Pulitzer Prize!
[01:34:58.281 --> 01:35:03.262]  Zuckerberg came out on Friday in the New York Times and it said, Zuckerberg covers up his webcam.
[01:35:03.302 --> 01:35:04.002]  That was the headline.
[01:35:04.562 --> 01:35:05.423]  You should too.
[01:35:07.028 --> 01:35:13.629]  About 19, 20 years after I pioneered it and have been made fun of at least 18 years ago on BBC documentaries.
[01:35:14.349 --> 01:35:17.990]  Alex, John Ronson asks, why is your webcam covered?
[01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:21.011]  You think they're watching you, do they?
[01:35:22.051 --> 01:35:26.672]  Oh, the little Poli-Wolf think he got a little bit of a problem, huh?
[01:35:27.432 --> 01:35:30.072]  Oh, you think little Green Man won't get you too, huh?
[01:35:30.713 --> 01:35:32.253]  And werewolves as well.
[01:35:33.271 --> 01:35:35.792]  He wants to ask me, he goes, do you believe in werewolves?
[01:35:36.753 --> 01:35:38.614]  Because we're driving through this fog area.
[01:35:38.634 --> 01:35:41.116]  And I go, no, I just said it looks like where a werewolf would live.
[01:35:41.156 --> 01:35:42.276]  Man, look at that, like six foot thing.
[01:35:42.837 --> 01:35:45.398]  You afraid of the, you afraid of the werewolves?
[01:35:46.759 --> 01:35:49.941]  And I said, uh, yeah, I'm real afraid of the werewolves.
[01:35:49.961 --> 01:35:53.783]  He actually put it in his book that I'm afraid of werewolves.
[01:35:55.904 --> 01:35:56.244]  I don't know.
[01:35:56.284 --> 01:35:56.745]  It's just funny.
[01:35:56.765 --> 01:35:57.645]  I actually like John Ross.
[01:35:57.685 --> 01:35:59.066]  We should get him back up on the show sometime.
[01:36:01.129 --> 01:36:03.029]  You afraid of the werewolves, Alex?
[01:36:03.089 --> 01:36:07.150]  He didn't really speak with that Oliver Twist Cockney accent, but it's fun to talk like that, isn't it?
[01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:16.252]  But there's something intellectual about almost the calm, lazy eyes of the left.
[01:36:17.352 --> 01:36:20.933]  We don't want to arrest you unless you deny global warming.
[01:36:23.213 --> 01:36:24.993]  Oh, no one really wants to arrest you.
[01:36:25.073 --> 01:36:26.513]  Oh, actually, we do now.
[01:36:28.294 --> 01:36:28.994]  That's liberal.
[01:36:30.011 --> 01:36:31.672]  There's a jail cell waiting for you.
[01:36:31.692 --> 01:36:33.572]  It's like Bill Nye the Science Guy.
[01:36:33.832 --> 01:36:36.573]  Mark Moran goes, you don't really want to arrest climate change deniers.
[01:36:36.593 --> 01:36:38.094]  He goes, yes, actually we do.
[01:36:38.154 --> 01:36:39.074]  We're going to arrest you.
[01:36:40.475 --> 01:36:41.995]  Wow, you're really dangerous.
[01:36:45.876 --> 01:36:46.837]  But it's easy, you see.
[01:36:47.477 --> 01:36:51.738]  They think if they go with the establishment, they end up getting power.
[01:36:51.958 --> 01:36:52.379]  And you know what?
[01:36:52.419 --> 01:36:56.500]  You would in the past when the establishment still had viewers and still had supporters.
[01:36:58.479 --> 01:36:59.299]  You don't anymore.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:06.242]  Our reporters are going to be on the ground in McAllen at 1.30.
[01:37:08.884 --> 01:37:11.205]  So definitely look for that with Jakari Jackson.
[01:37:13.446 --> 01:37:14.466]  And what camera person went with him?
[01:37:16.347 --> 01:37:17.527]  Michael Zimmerman, what a great guy.
[01:37:18.528 --> 01:37:19.568]  And Adon Salazar.
[01:37:19.648 --> 01:37:20.729]  I'm glad Adon was able to go.
[01:37:23.858 --> 01:37:29.644]  I saw this story yesterday morning and I called Buckley and Dew up and I said, please, whatever team is ready to go, get them to the border.
[01:37:30.885 --> 01:37:34.669]  And then I'm not even exhausted an hour and 37 minutes of the broadcast.
[01:37:34.969 --> 01:37:38.232]  I just, I've talked a lot about this.
[01:37:39.913 --> 01:37:46.640]  When a certain constellation of news lines up and confirms 20 years of research, worse than we thought.
[01:37:53.183 --> 01:37:57.965]  It's kind of like calling in a family member to tell them that their mother or father died.
[01:37:57.985 --> 01:38:00.366]  Or that their son died.
[01:38:00.386 --> 01:38:04.648]  And I've had to give people the news of family deaths multiple times.
[01:38:04.688 --> 01:38:05.348]  It's not fun.
[01:38:07.969 --> 01:38:11.290]  But at the same time, this isn't like a family death, or it feels like that.
[01:38:12.751 --> 01:38:21.114]  Because knowing about this is what's going to allow us to reverse it and to stop it.
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:38.855]  But I've learned to psychoanalyze myself and realize that this news is all so sensational, all so over the top, all so incredible in how they roll out the most evil deception and just evil takeovers.
[01:38:41.098 --> 01:38:41.939]  Like it's no big deal.
[01:38:43.533 --> 01:38:46.714]  That I could take one of these stories and talk for 10 hours about it.
[01:38:47.254 --> 01:38:52.716]  You've seen me take a two-minute clip of Obama and talk for 30 minutes, just showing how each statement's a total lie from every angle.
[01:38:53.416 --> 01:39:03.939]  And the problem is, my brain looks at one of these, watches one of these reports, and just explodes with all the connections and angles, and it's just... Trying to communicate this to the general public, I don't even know how you do it.
[01:39:04.039 --> 01:39:09.580]  I mean... Because it's so overwhelming, so obvious, so over-the-top.
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:11.841]  I likened it last hour to the police
[01:39:14.875 --> 01:39:17.317]  Fighting a dead body, let's say, in the back of a guy's car.
[01:39:19.619 --> 01:39:22.481]  Stereotypical, you know, people say, why do you say the back of a guy's car?
[01:39:22.501 --> 01:39:23.101]  How about a woman's car?
[01:39:23.121 --> 01:39:24.883]  Because men commit 98% of the murders, that's why.
[01:39:25.483 --> 01:39:26.104]  Stereotypical.
[01:39:26.304 --> 01:39:28.185]  Just like Muslims commit 98% of the terrorism.
[01:39:28.385 --> 01:39:29.747]  It's a fact, not a stereotype.
[01:39:30.607 --> 01:39:43.017]  But, cops pull somebody over, they see blood and stuff in there, and a weapon, they search the car, probable cause, reasonable suspicion, and there's a dead body in the back, get a warrant for the house, find 20-something dead bodies in the basement.
[01:39:44.633 --> 01:39:48.314]  There's videos, you know, of the serial killer torturing the woman to death, and this has happened many times.
[01:39:48.555 --> 01:39:50.035]  This is just one, you know, analogy.
[01:39:50.735 --> 01:40:00.699]  And it's like, I'm up here going, and here's this dead body, uh, poured with lime, and here's this skeleton we think he killed years before, and people are going, doesn't look like a body to me.
[01:40:00.719 --> 01:40:02.720]  Well, here's the videos of him torturing him.
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:04.561]  Oh, yeah, right, racist.
[01:40:04.641 --> 01:40:09.203]  You know, I mean, it's like world government out in the open, announcing world armies,
[01:40:11.024 --> 01:40:12.005]  Via the EU Army.
[01:40:12.045 --> 01:40:13.767]  We told people 20 years ago that was coming.
[01:40:14.807 --> 01:40:16.129]  That's been announced yesterday.
[01:40:16.149 --> 01:40:25.257]  UN armored vehicles of brand new construction being brought into the US and shipped everywhere, all over the country.
[01:40:25.277 --> 01:40:34.585]  I mean, UN Abrams tanks, UN armored vehicles of the brand new construction, just crazy town.
[01:40:37.067 --> 01:40:37.468]  I've got
[01:40:39.537 --> 01:40:43.640]  FEMA contractor predicts social unrest caused by 395% food prices.
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:49.483]  That's from... Vice.
[01:40:50.904 --> 01:40:52.185]  Which used to be a pretty good organization.
[01:40:52.205 --> 01:40:54.927]  I mean, now it's run by HBO and this bunch of trendies.
[01:40:56.848 --> 01:41:02.212]  Vice wanted to come interview me the last few months, a couple times, and I just finally went, you know... I'd said yes at first, and I just said, you know what?
[01:41:05.194 --> 01:41:05.374]  No.
[01:41:07.677 --> 01:41:08.418]  It's like, why not?
[01:41:08.458 --> 01:41:09.178]  Are you scared?
[01:41:09.238 --> 01:41:11.060]  It's like, no, man, I just got stuff to do.
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:16.384]  I just... I don't want to sit here with some tranny going, you believe in black helicopters and a world government?
[01:41:16.484 --> 01:41:17.946]  Aliens eating brains, huh?
[01:41:19.067 --> 01:41:20.167]  And you hate gay people.
[01:41:20.187 --> 01:41:22.810]  And I'm just like, I just don't have time for children anymore.
[01:41:22.830 --> 01:41:28.394]  I mean, you may think it's funny they put fluoride in the water to brain damage people.
[01:41:28.675 --> 01:41:30.056]  We even have the declassified documents.
[01:41:30.856 --> 01:41:32.518]  The White House science czar wrote a book about it.
[01:41:33.336 --> 01:41:37.299]  You may think it's funny them teaching school kids not to have a fat diet so their brains don't grow.
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:45.186]  It's the same thing as not having... 50% of formula should be fat.
[01:41:46.187 --> 01:41:47.448]  Healthy, clean fats.
[01:41:47.528 --> 01:41:47.848]  It's not.
[01:41:47.888 --> 01:41:48.929]  On average it's like 20%.
[01:41:49.269 --> 01:41:53.292]  The rest is high fructose corn syrup that causes massive brain damage, stupid!
[01:41:53.933 --> 01:41:55.434]  And that's why you are stupid!
[01:41:55.454 --> 01:41:57.396]  Because you never got milk!
[01:41:59.178 --> 01:42:03.540]  And I realize that they're a bunch of brain-dead zombies that just have like five things they say.
[01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:08.202]  You're a racist, you're a homophobe, you're a sexist, and you don't dress ironically.
[01:42:10.623 --> 01:42:12.403]  And I'm sorry, I'm a real intellectual.
[01:42:14.384 --> 01:42:19.006]  To the point, I talk in my real Texas accent and don't put on airs like you jackasses do.
[01:42:20.506 --> 01:42:23.228]  And I don't, I don't even, I just, I don't even want to cover this news.
[01:42:23.268 --> 01:42:25.010]  It's just, it's unbelievably horrible.
[01:42:25.770 --> 01:42:28.553]  And it just confirms everything and what my gut's been telling me.
[01:42:28.593 --> 01:42:30.534]  And it's just like, give me a break, man.
[01:42:31.095 --> 01:42:33.937]  Do you yuppies really want global financial collapse?
[01:42:34.377 --> 01:42:35.738]  Do you understand it's by design?
[01:42:35.778 --> 01:42:38.781]  Do you know what a Great Depression will look like in this country?
[01:42:39.421 --> 01:42:43.625]  When it's filled with people like you, it's going to be hellish.
[01:42:47.110 --> 01:42:48.452]  Go watch The Grapes of Wrath.
[01:42:48.872 --> 01:42:51.095]  And that was with super hard-working Christian people.
[01:42:51.335 --> 01:42:53.677]  And that's based on composites and stuff that really went on.
[01:42:54.358 --> 01:43:02.608]  And it's horrible communist propaganda where they show up and the commie even looks like FDR and saves them and everything.
[01:43:02.668 --> 01:43:05.531]  But if you want to see what the Depression looked like, go watch that movie.
[01:43:10.208 --> 01:43:15.191]  And just armies of dumb, entitled socialist voters wanting free lunches.
[01:43:15.631 --> 01:43:21.254]  And when their plight's ten times worse in a few years, they'll never even remember or blame socialism.
[01:43:21.534 --> 01:43:22.614]  They'll demand even more.
[01:43:22.654 --> 01:43:23.875]  They'll demand communism.
[01:43:23.915 --> 01:43:24.915]  There's no end.
[01:43:25.276 --> 01:43:35.821]  And we'll have big mega-corporations, tax-exempt, behind armored fortress walls laughing at us as we're culturally devoured by drooling morons.
[01:43:42.059 --> 01:43:42.579]  Let me do this.
[01:43:42.639 --> 01:43:44.040]  Let me try to reset here for a moment.
[01:43:46.181 --> 01:43:53.564]  And then I'm going to come back and cover the UN military vehicles, World Net Daily.
[01:43:53.604 --> 01:43:55.544]  That ties in with Vice.
[01:43:56.545 --> 01:44:00.546]  FEMA contractor predicts social unrest in government report.
[01:44:00.726 --> 01:44:02.747]  395% food price hikes.
[01:44:04.728 --> 01:44:06.549]  And it's not like I'm just going with this FEMA report.
[01:44:07.009 --> 01:44:08.630]  We told you all this in
[01:44:12.141 --> 01:44:12.222]  In 2007.
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:28.765]  And then we know the rest of the story, how the globalists admit they're engineering this financial collapse, but getting themselves positioned as the saviors with the many collapses around the world, so they're fully in position for a total takeover when they really drop the hammer.
[01:44:29.445 --> 01:44:43.391]  And we're desperately here trying to blame them for it, because they admittedly are who are behind it, because that's one of our only hopes to reverse it, because if they think they're politically going to get the blame, and if they think politically they're going to get brought down, they will be forced to back off.
[01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:47.994]  So I'm here trying to stop this for my own self-interest, for my own family.
[01:44:49.695 --> 01:44:57.079]  And I'm dealing with 50% of the public that literally doesn't know what planet they're on and can't find their butt with both hands.
[01:44:59.841 --> 01:45:01.042]  And that's why I'm frustrated.
[01:45:01.342 --> 01:45:02.643]  That's why I'm physically nauseous.
[01:45:04.059 --> 01:45:12.661]  Because during the break, I was just trying to go over all this news, get ready to come back and cover it, and I just, I've actually felt vomitous, and I just, I can't do, I cannot cover this, okay?
[01:45:12.681 --> 01:45:13.401]  I just can't do it anymore.
[01:45:13.761 --> 01:45:15.402]  Fine, everything's fine, everything's wonderful, okay?
[01:45:16.302 --> 01:45:31.045]  There's no world government, fluoride's good for you, the vaccines are good for you, GMO's good for you, radiation leaking's good for you, the liberals have told us, George Mombiot, the Guardian, it's all just freakazoid craziness.
[01:45:35.922 --> 01:45:43.406]  I mean, I got stacks of articles where the UN is suing people, taking over, advising police departments involved, setting up domestic spy grids.
[01:45:43.786 --> 01:45:46.547]  They've got the Military Training for Gun Confiscation, Army Times.
[01:45:46.968 --> 01:45:51.690]  I mean, they are really gearing up for some big stuff, and I'm hoping it doesn't all go to hell in a handbasket.
[01:45:52.530 --> 01:45:53.511]  I'm trying to stop it.
[01:45:53.791 --> 01:45:55.452]  Admitting we're in trouble stops it.
[01:45:55.692 --> 01:45:59.014]  Admitting Hitler's planning to start World War II could have stopped it.
[01:46:00.334 --> 01:46:03.796]  Admitting our government's trying to start war with Russia could stop it.
[01:46:05.592 --> 01:46:08.495]  These elites always become megalomaniacs and think they're invincible.
[01:46:09.055 --> 01:46:10.657]  And then they start wars they can't reverse.
[01:46:10.937 --> 01:46:15.581]  But back then we didn't have atomic weapons or hydrogen bombs or God knows what else they've developed.
[01:46:16.862 --> 01:46:20.065]  The Pentagon leaked 10 years ago they've got antimatter bombs.
[01:46:20.866 --> 01:46:27.372]  They're afraid to test them because they estimate it'd blow the entire planet up and turn it into a new asteroid belt.
[01:46:29.494 --> 01:46:31.756]  Maybe the entire solar system.
[01:46:33.459 --> 01:46:44.824]  And then they'll have some joke article in some White House-funded idiot group making fun of me for that statement when it was in the, it was in the MIT Quarterly, and it was in the San Francisco Chronicle!
[01:46:47.745 --> 01:46:51.786]  But you just joke about it like chimeras, I told you about 20 years ago.
[01:46:52.047 --> 01:46:52.787]  Now they admit.
[01:46:53.127 --> 01:46:54.267]  Human-animal splices.
[01:46:55.348 --> 01:46:59.149]  And again, I'm not up here on some frickin' high horse, man.
[01:46:59.490 --> 01:47:02.811]  This stuff is all battle plan for you and your family.
[01:47:05.572 --> 01:47:06.713]  I read this report right here.
[01:47:06.733 --> 01:47:12.375]  I'll come back and cover this, but FEMA contractor predicts social unrest caused by 395% food price spikes.
[01:47:14.936 --> 01:47:26.221]  The simulation titled Food Chain Reaction was desktop game exercise involving the participation of 65 officials, US, Europe, Africa, India, Brazil, and key multinational and intergovernmental institutions.
[01:47:27.418 --> 01:47:31.279]  And it goes on to basically say there's no way to stop it with the population and what's happened with food.
[01:47:31.719 --> 01:47:34.060]  And the globalists have done all this stuff to shut down food production.
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:36.500]  That's the post-industrial world they've set up.
[01:47:38.601 --> 01:47:41.402]  That's State Department Memorandum 200 from Henry Kissinger.
[01:47:41.422 --> 01:47:41.962]  Remember?
[01:47:41.982 --> 01:47:41.962]  1979?
[01:47:42.322 --> 01:47:43.422]  It was declassified in 79.
[01:47:47.263 --> 01:47:47.523]  It was from 19... 77.
[01:47:47.603 --> 01:47:48.184]  You can pull it up.
[01:47:48.204 --> 01:47:48.824]  It's declassified.
[01:47:48.844 --> 01:47:48.904]  CIA.
[01:47:57.671 --> 01:48:01.139]  Where he said the goal is to turn the food off, starve the third world, and finally the West.
[01:48:02.241 --> 01:48:04.106]  He writes books calling military dumb animals.
[01:48:09.130 --> 01:48:10.110]  I mean, this is serious.
[01:48:11.151 --> 01:48:12.592]  This is serious, serious.
[01:48:12.612 --> 01:48:16.974]  They've got a plan, and boy, I see them getting it lined up, and I don't want to see it come through.
[01:48:17.174 --> 01:48:18.314]  By the way, this is how my brain works.
[01:48:19.014 --> 01:48:21.516]  Oh, we sell the highest quality, storable foods.
[01:48:21.536 --> 01:48:24.197]  The last 25 years, the lowest price out there at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:48:24.217 --> 01:48:25.477]  It's InfoWare Select.
[01:48:25.497 --> 01:48:27.058]  It's the full spectrum of my patronage supply.
[01:48:27.278 --> 01:48:29.719]  We sell it, the same stuff right next to it, just a little bit higher price.
[01:48:30.059 --> 01:48:30.640]  Already a great deal.
[01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:33.281]  And I think, boy, we're going to have a Great Depression.
[01:48:33.321 --> 01:48:34.201]  It's probably inevitable now.
[01:48:34.261 --> 01:48:36.881]  I need to raise more money to fund this operation through the Depression.
[01:48:36.941 --> 01:48:38.102]  How am I going to do this?
[01:48:38.402 --> 01:48:41.183]  Plus, I need to get more storable food at the office and for my family.
[01:48:41.503 --> 01:48:43.223]  Plus, everybody needs to get this for themselves.
[01:48:43.623 --> 01:48:46.324]  So I'm going to show people this report and hope it gets them to buy food.
[01:48:47.304 --> 01:48:51.165]  The media would spin that and say opportunistically, he uses a FEMA report to get people to get food.
[01:48:51.645 --> 01:48:53.926]  Well, yeah, the ship's sinking.
[01:48:53.966 --> 01:48:54.786]  Get to a life raft.
[01:48:55.922 --> 01:48:56.882]  I hope you don't have to use it.
[01:48:56.942 --> 01:48:57.642]  I hope we're wrong.
[01:48:57.843 --> 01:48:58.683]  We're trying to stop it.
[01:48:58.863 --> 01:49:05.605]  But if you don't go to InfoWarsSelect.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and get the high-quality, storable food, you are insane.
[01:49:05.845 --> 01:49:19.088]  If you don't get more guns and ammunition, if you don't learn how to use guns, if you haven't learned how to use them, if you don't have neighbors and friends you trust, and maybe a neighbor who's got a farm 50 miles outside town, believe me, if stuff collapses, it could get really bad.
[01:49:19.469 --> 01:49:20.789]  Seven million people
[01:49:22.870 --> 01:49:24.111]  Multiple university studies.
[01:49:24.151 --> 01:49:24.591]  Look it up.
[01:49:24.651 --> 01:49:27.654]  Type in 7 million people starved during the Great Depression.
[01:49:28.074 --> 01:49:32.678]  They starved or died of illnesses resulting from malnutrition.
[01:49:32.718 --> 01:49:34.499]  That's 7 million.
[01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:38.062]  We were 90% agrarian.
[01:49:38.082 --> 01:49:39.223]  We were 90% rural.
[01:49:39.784 --> 01:49:41.825]  And more than half those people were self-sufficient.
[01:49:42.786 --> 01:49:46.229]  So, more than half the country was self-sufficient and 7 million starved to death.
[01:49:46.249 --> 01:49:48.070]  7 million.
[01:49:48.090 --> 01:49:49.251]  7 million plus.
[01:49:52.244 --> 01:50:09.179]  Now you think about that, long and hard, because today we are, what is it, 89% urban, 11-10% depending on which federal study, rural, and less than half of those people, 5% or less, are self-sufficient.
[01:50:09.359 --> 01:50:10.480]  My God!
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:23.486]  We've gone from 55% self-sufficient to less than 5% self-sufficient, and we are an immoral, degenerate, satanic nation that sells baby parts and keeps them alive to harvest them.
[01:50:23.966 --> 01:50:33.590]  We don't even care, and you imagine these drooling slobs running around acting trendy that are calling for our arrest and calling for the murder of gun owners, just cropping and begging at the feet of the globalists.
[01:50:34.091 --> 01:50:36.412]  I mean, they'll be the first people, the globalists.
[01:50:38.368 --> 01:50:38.929]  Shut down.
[01:50:39.069 --> 01:50:41.011]  But that's after they have a full takeover.
[01:50:41.071 --> 01:50:42.953]  Just drooling masses of nobodies.
[01:50:42.973 --> 01:50:44.474]  You have an authoritarian control.
[01:50:44.514 --> 01:50:45.075]  They're coming.
[01:50:46.536 --> 01:50:51.421]  You can really see this whole global system that'll make World War II look like nothing.
[01:50:51.661 --> 01:50:52.382]  They're trying to set up.
[01:50:52.402 --> 01:50:53.903]  And everyone's instincts tell them, get ready.
[01:50:54.664 --> 01:50:59.609]  Everybody's instincts are saying, get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready.
[01:51:12.566 --> 01:51:16.929]  Once upon a time, there was a dude named Prescott, last name Bush.
[01:51:17.229 --> 01:51:17.830]  Guess what?
[01:51:18.630 --> 01:51:20.872]  He helped run a bank, funding Nazis.
[01:51:20.912 --> 01:51:23.373]  Well, you'd think that Hitler got his tank money, Bobby.
[01:51:23.573 --> 01:51:26.175]  Hitler made a killin', and Prescott made a killin'.
[01:51:26.195 --> 01:51:29.717]  Congratulations, the Bush family got millions.
[01:51:30.458 --> 01:51:33.180]  That's a lot of loot now, time to turn it up now.
[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:34.561]  Ain't no turnin' back now.
[01:51:34.621 --> 01:51:37.082]  Prescott had a son, his name was Herbert Walker.
[01:51:37.102 --> 01:51:38.043]  Little Herbert Walker.
[01:52:06.437 --> 01:52:08.640]  We're good to go.
[01:52:35.592 --> 01:52:40.454]  He became depressed like his father, and explored a way to create a new Pearl Harbor.
[01:52:40.714 --> 01:52:41.755]  Incredible!
[01:52:41.915 --> 01:52:51.979]  On September 11th, Bush and the head of the Bin Laden family would be at the same Carlyle Group meeting in Washington, a few miles before Osama Bin Laden's hijackers would attack them.
[01:52:51.999 --> 01:52:56.761]  Bush, Kennedy, and the Bin Laden Group gained everything they had wanted as a direct result of 9-11.
[01:52:56.801 --> 01:52:57.441]  And of course, U.S.
[01:52:57.521 --> 01:52:58.682]  oil and arms companies.
[01:53:01.713 --> 01:53:04.655]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:53:04.956 --> 01:53:14.543]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[01:53:14.844 --> 01:53:20.048]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[01:53:20.128 --> 01:53:28.935]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[01:53:29.255 --> 01:53:37.824]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[01:53:38.085 --> 01:53:44.992]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigyrex herbal processing technique.
[01:53:45.132 --> 01:53:50.458]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you the best.
[01:53:50.698 --> 01:53:51.599]  I don't think so.
[01:54:22.891 --> 01:54:23.211]  3 p.m.
[01:54:23.231 --> 01:54:24.152]  Central, we're here live.
[01:54:24.172 --> 01:54:27.933]  You know, I said I was going to take a bunch of calls today, but we're so booked with guests.
[01:54:29.574 --> 01:54:36.936]  I've got to probably just look at the guest list this week and scrub a bunch of people off of it, because I want to take your calls.
[01:54:37.056 --> 01:54:44.279]  I want to hear from you about what you think about all these UN vehicles around the United States, what you think of FEMA government reports.
[01:54:46.578 --> 01:54:55.500]  Because that's actually what this is, is a report conducted with multinational governments and our own government with the occupational 10-state dictatorship that is FEMA.
[01:54:56.961 --> 01:55:13.045]  You see, when we come in with intros that say, from deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, Alex Jones, I have to come out and make those radical statements because it's so radical, what the globalists have done, people are basically caught blindside by it.
[01:55:14.363 --> 01:55:16.484]  They're dumbfounded because it just sounds so outrageous.
[01:55:16.844 --> 01:55:24.707]  Multinationals, we didn't vote to enter or running things, and the UN's making our laws, and multinational banks are tax-exempt and have diplomatic immunity.
[01:55:24.767 --> 01:55:26.288]  I mean, that's all on record.
[01:55:26.648 --> 01:55:30.209]  And they're now coming in and saying, you're not going to use the word mother and father.
[01:55:30.250 --> 01:55:31.850]  You're not going to have any real state authority.
[01:55:32.530 --> 01:55:33.751]  We're not going to let you have guns.
[01:55:33.811 --> 01:55:34.631]  It's a UN treaty.
[01:55:34.951 --> 01:55:37.613]  The UN says we're going to take more refugees from Latin America.
[01:55:40.514 --> 01:55:41.914]  And that's in ABC News!
[01:55:41.994 --> 01:55:43.155]  The UN says!
[01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:46.911]  Well, they're illegal, but the U.N.
[01:55:46.971 --> 01:55:48.473]  says so, Obama's allowed to do it.
[01:55:48.873 --> 01:55:50.614]  Doesn't matter what the Supreme Court says.
[01:55:53.537 --> 01:55:57.700]  The globalists, the Rockefellers, set up the U.N.
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:01.483]  in 1945 to set up world government.
[01:56:01.683 --> 01:56:04.265]  Go read the book written by David Rockefeller.
[01:56:05.386 --> 01:56:06.247]  Go read the charter.
[01:56:08.570 --> 01:56:15.434]  Oh, but all the movie stars and the beauty queens, you know, when you watch Miss America, oh, I want to be with the UN and UNICEF and help kids.
[01:56:15.895 --> 01:56:17.776]  So people go, well, the UN must be this wonderful thing.
[01:56:17.796 --> 01:56:19.197]  The UN is hated all over the world.
[01:56:19.657 --> 01:56:21.718]  It runs sex slavery rings everywhere.
[01:56:21.858 --> 01:56:22.279]  Look it up.
[01:56:23.259 --> 01:56:24.280]  It runs drugs.
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:25.841]  It is the legion of death.
[01:56:29.275 --> 01:56:36.998]  And now they want to set up an EU army with the United Nations to, quote, police the nations so they can't leave.
[01:56:37.579 --> 01:56:39.359]  They actually say that.
[01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:41.980]  And it's just not even news.
[01:56:42.421 --> 01:56:47.003]  Oh, they're going to set up a domestic army to arrest people that criticize the open borders.
[01:56:47.063 --> 01:56:47.743]  Isn't that great?
[01:56:49.684 --> 01:56:55.489]  And I've got stacks of news in the United States at airports where Muslims are attacking Christians and freaking out.
[01:56:56.169 --> 01:56:58.071]  Or where Muslims are attacking gays, they see.
[01:56:58.111 --> 01:56:58.951]  That's in the news today.
[01:56:59.492 --> 01:57:04.916]  Or where a woman goes into a Catholic church and desecrates Mary, a Muslim woman, and just flips out.
[01:57:04.956 --> 01:57:07.218]  These people kill each other in their own countries!
[01:57:07.238 --> 01:57:11.201]  They just police each other, get in everybody's faces, run around foaming at the mouth.
[01:57:12.962 --> 01:57:16.785]  And now in Germany, they're having to say, Oktoberfest has to be behind closed doors.
[01:57:17.765 --> 01:57:21.849]  Or you have to go through a checkpoint because the Muslims are coming in and attacking people.
[01:57:24.672 --> 01:57:34.662]  If they catch you in more than 11 Muslim nations, kissing another man if you're a man or a woman if you're a woman, they kill you!
[01:57:35.823 --> 01:57:41.409]  If they rape your wife or daughter, it's her fault and they kill her!
[01:57:44.448 --> 01:57:46.769]  This is who our, quote, elite are bringing in.
[01:57:47.210 --> 01:57:56.135]  And then meanwhile... I'm gonna shoot a special report on this for the Nightly News, but I'm going to do it.
[01:57:57.976 --> 01:58:01.498]  And I'm gonna cover it some with Pchenik and others that are coming up.
[01:58:01.518 --> 01:58:03.639]  Pchenik pops up at 30 minutes, the David Knight takes over.
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:06.321]  And Pchenik leaves us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:58:06.641 --> 01:58:08.442]  Is Pchenik on for an hour?
[01:58:10.919 --> 01:58:11.259]  30 minutes.
[01:58:11.279 --> 01:58:12.299]  I'm going to take some phone calls.
[01:58:12.319 --> 01:58:14.420]  We will just take nothing but phone calls at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:16.280]  You can get lined up right now.
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:18.141]  First-time callers just on this food issue.
[01:58:18.161 --> 01:58:18.201]  800-259-9231.
[01:58:18.221 --> 01:58:18.261]  800-259-9231.
[01:58:18.281 --> 01:58:21.062]  The Brexit, all these global meltdowns, it's just out of control.
[01:58:21.082 --> 01:58:24.083]  The globalists always plan on having a global crisis.
[01:58:29.924 --> 01:58:32.587]  That would then bring in a greater EU dictatorship.
[01:58:32.627 --> 01:58:36.592]  But instead, it's causing nation-states to pull out because the Liberty Movement warned folks.
[01:58:37.012 --> 01:58:40.096]  So the point is, the elite aren't the only power in this universe.
[01:58:40.176 --> 01:58:41.738]  You have to take action, and you are.
[01:58:42.158 --> 01:58:43.440]  And we're starting to gain ground.
[01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:45.302]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:45.322 --> 01:58:46.303]  Let's just get Machinica on now.
[01:58:51.857 --> 01:58:55.881]  Hillary Clinton is posing as an advocate for domestic abuse victims.
[01:58:56.361 --> 01:58:59.324]  But behind closed doors, she's a violent abuser.
[01:58:59.804 --> 01:59:01.986]  Find out what Hillary has done to Bill.
[01:59:02.386 --> 01:59:03.928]  The Clinton's War on Women.
[01:59:04.368 --> 01:59:05.189]  In stores now.
[01:59:07.373 --> 01:59:10.334]  Special Forces selection, it's not like you could ever take the easy road.
[01:59:10.634 --> 01:59:14.535]  And you can't take steroids to make, you know, being a Special Forces operator easy.
[01:59:14.575 --> 01:59:20.876]  I'm always looking for the best and natural way to get myself to the limit.
[01:59:20.896 --> 01:59:22.536]  I have to have the edge over my opponents.
[01:59:22.636 --> 01:59:26.397]  I believe that Super Male Vitality, that gives me the edge.
[01:59:26.437 --> 01:59:30.538]  I've been taking it, and I'm still getting faster and stronger every day.
[01:59:31.298 --> 01:59:35.819]  Start your journey to Super Male Vitality today at InfoWarsLife.com
[01:59:36.539 --> 01:59:42.343]  Hillary Clinton has an unusually close relationship with top female aide, Huma Abedin.
[01:59:42.963 --> 01:59:45.665]  But does Huma have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood?
[01:59:46.525 --> 01:59:50.968]  Find out in The Clinton's War on Women, in stores now.
[01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:56.432]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:15.976 --> 02:00:18.017]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:18.617 --> 02:00:23.679]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:24.239 --> 02:00:41.105]  I'll say this.
[02:00:41.785 --> 02:00:44.586]  The United States is sitting in a better position than many nations.
[02:00:46.530 --> 02:00:49.852]  But everything Obama is doing, and the globalists are doing, is trying to undermine the country.
[02:00:50.913 --> 02:00:52.274]  And I'm going to ask Dr. Pachinik this.
[02:00:52.855 --> 02:01:06.705]  If the elite are in control of Europe and the United States, they're successfully undermining Russia and China, but they're successfully undermining the American people as well, and the family, and trying to sabotage our own military.
[02:01:09.335 --> 02:01:10.336]  What is going on here?
[02:01:10.516 --> 02:01:19.723]  And Dr. Steve Pchenik of StevePchenik.com, he of course co-wrote books with Tom Clancy, he was involved in all sorts of clandestine operations, the head of psychological warfare for the State Department.
[02:01:20.704 --> 02:01:27.168]  You couldn't get a more informed, patriotic insider on than a member of the Council on Foreign Relations until he resigned.
[02:01:27.188 --> 02:01:32.112]  He was one of the first prominent people to expose 9-11 as an inside job in early 2002.
[02:01:34.059 --> 02:01:35.980]  He exposed the whole Bin Laden hoax accurately.
[02:01:36.580 --> 02:01:38.180]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:39.341]  But Doc, you heard my question.
[02:01:40.101 --> 02:01:45.122]  I see his schizophrenic policies and I get the thing of funding all sides or whatever, but it seems to be beyond that.
[02:01:45.142 --> 02:01:53.304]  And I know there's lots of different factions, but why does our government do a lot of things that actually help American interest, but then other things that actually undermine our interest?
[02:01:53.385 --> 02:01:54.745]  Is that just different power structures?
[02:01:56.089 --> 02:02:09.391]  Well, it is, Alex, as usual, our government is very, very self-destructive, in part because it has become so large that one part literally does not know what the other part.
[02:02:09.431 --> 02:02:20.953]  For example, the CIA was supplying ammunition and guns to the so-called rebels who were fighting Bashar Assad, while the military was training others who were pro-Assad.
[02:02:21.013 --> 02:02:24.174]  I mean, it is so confusing, and that's why one of the reasons
[02:02:24.654 --> 02:02:30.378]  We need a president who's been vetted out completely, not just somebody who the CIA wanted up there.
[02:02:30.859 --> 02:02:41.647]  We need a president who understands what it is we're doing, where we're going, and has a coterie of experienced people who have been in crises before.
[02:02:42.187 --> 02:02:49.413]  Now, one of the greatest problems in this Brexit is the fact that our government didn't know at all that this was going to happen.
[02:02:50.033 --> 02:02:52.635]  Not only was it a binary decision, i.e.
[02:02:52.855 --> 02:03:10.025]  either England left or didn't leave, the country was so convinced and so self-delusional, as was Obama and Kerry, that they really didn't map out what would happen in case this was a situation, and in fact it caught them completely
[02:03:10.685 --> 02:03:12.447]  And so they threatened to hold them hostage.
[02:03:12.467 --> 02:03:13.247]  Their bluff got called.
[02:03:13.267 --> 02:03:14.188]  Now things are disintegrating.
[02:03:14.208 --> 02:03:15.289]  They're in a lot of trouble.
[02:03:33.726 --> 02:03:35.567]  Well, that's correct.
[02:03:35.647 --> 02:03:39.770]  The good news is that God loves drunks and the United States.
[02:03:40.030 --> 02:03:57.042]  No matter what happens to us and no matter how incompetent our government is, and it's exceedingly incompetent, for reasons that we can go into later on, probably because of the entrepreneurial nature of our people and because we're so large and we're blessed by two oceans.
[02:03:57.748 --> 02:03:59.610]  It really doesn't affect us.
[02:04:00.170 --> 02:04:04.794]  In reality, actually, if people are concerned, what I would say to them is to buy
[02:04:05.612 --> 02:04:12.718]  Stocks that give a dividend and are, you know, very secure because basically what you're doing is you're going along with the dollar.
[02:04:13.178 --> 02:04:18.523]  Going along with the dollar means that America can bet on the dollar being the supreme currency.
[02:04:19.123 --> 02:04:28.631]  And I want to go back to historical precedents where we had brilliant men during the World War II, not only Patton, Eisenhower,
[02:04:29.071 --> 02:04:34.935]  But we had a gentleman named Morgenthau, a German Jew who figured out very quickly in December of 1944
[02:04:36.917 --> 02:04:42.622]  That in order for America to be a really superpower, we have to denominate all currency.
[02:05:02.614 --> 02:05:06.036]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:05:06.397 --> 02:05:13.521]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:05:14.122 --> 02:05:22.487]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:05:22.767 --> 02:05:32.534]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[02:05:32.754 --> 02:05:36.575]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:05:36.995 --> 02:05:40.055]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[02:05:40.395 --> 02:05:51.477]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[02:05:51.537 --> 02:05:54.218]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[02:05:54.438 --> 02:06:00.419]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[02:06:00.999 --> 02:06:01.580]  I train hard.
[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:02.580]  I work hard.
[02:06:02.600 --> 02:06:08.185]  I'm always looking for the best way to be the best version of myself.
[02:06:12.388 --> 02:06:15.830]  During Special Forces selection, it's not like you could ever take the easy road.
[02:06:15.850 --> 02:06:20.094]  You know, you can't take stairways to make, you know, being a Special Force operator easy.
[02:06:20.434 --> 02:06:25.818]  I'm always looking for the best and natural way to get myself to the limit.
[02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:32.604]  As the idea of getting in there and doing real hard work is changing who you are.
[02:06:33.265 --> 02:06:38.388]  Becoming better, stronger, faster, and ultimately, harder to kill.
[02:06:39.549 --> 02:06:41.050]  I have to have the edge over my opponents.
[02:06:42.131 --> 02:06:46.914]  I believe that InfoWars products, SuperMail Vitality, you know, that gives me the edge.
[02:06:47.034 --> 02:06:51.317]  I've been taking it, and I'm still getting faster and stronger every day.
[02:06:53.084 --> 02:06:57.487]  Start your journey to super male vitality today at Infowarslife.com
[02:07:13.618 --> 02:07:16.760]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:17.181]  Right?
[02:07:17.201 --> 02:07:19.562]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:07:19.922 --> 02:07:23.425]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:07:23.465 --> 02:07:26.607]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:07:27.128 --> 02:07:31.891]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:07:32.451 --> 02:07:34.293]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[02:07:34.633 --> 02:07:39.076]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:07:39.216 --> 02:07:41.237]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:07:41.858 --> 02:07:43.359]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:07:43.459 --> 02:07:43.719]  Exactly.
[02:07:43.739 --> 02:07:47.563]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:07:48.023 --> 02:07:56.030]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:14.446 --> 02:08:21.953]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:08:22.934 --> 02:08:26.838]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:27.298 --> 02:08:31.142]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:08:31.482 --> 02:08:33.104]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:36.098 --> 02:08:37.419]  We talk about a command center.
[02:08:37.479 --> 02:08:38.439]  We are under FEMA.
[02:08:38.939 --> 02:08:41.580]  We are under this whole corporate global model.
[02:08:41.660 --> 02:08:43.601]  And the people of Europe have discovered that.
[02:08:44.021 --> 02:08:45.562]  Eight nations want to leave the euro.
[02:08:45.622 --> 02:08:46.342]  It's dictatorial.
[02:08:47.422 --> 02:08:51.764]  We have the Brexit that Obama and others and Hillary, you know, said, oh, you know, they'll never leave.
[02:08:52.604 --> 02:08:55.846]  To me, it seems like a big defeat for globalism.
[02:08:56.886 --> 02:08:58.727]  And it seems like they were caught flat-footed.
[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:11.785]  But Dr. Steve Pachinick, former member of the Council on Foreign Relations, best-selling author, one of the founders of General Boykin and others of Delta Force, that's on record, the guy that ran the Camp David Accords, I mean, his pedigree is just that amazing.
[02:09:12.566 --> 02:09:20.049]  You can just Google his name and, you know, he can't talk about too much, the Justice Department will come call him into court again, like happens when he comes on the show routinely.
[02:09:20.689 --> 02:09:26.253]  Now, because of how secretive, you know, all this stuff is he's been involved in overthrowing countries, stopping the overthrow of countries.
[02:09:26.313 --> 02:09:27.134]  I mean, that's on record.
[02:09:27.394 --> 02:09:30.036]  So he's the real deal with a lot of talkers out there.
[02:09:30.076 --> 02:09:35.180]  And I tell you, he really predicted four years ago after Benghazi what would happen.
[02:09:35.681 --> 02:09:36.501]  We're going to go in.
[02:09:36.561 --> 02:09:38.123]  We're going to block these Saudi guys.
[02:09:38.643 --> 02:09:39.984]  Other people are trying to double crosses.
[02:09:40.024 --> 02:09:40.745]  We're going to stop them.
[02:09:40.785 --> 02:09:41.966]  That all came out is what happened.
[02:09:42.426 --> 02:09:45.549]  I got other sources that are public, others that aren't, that concurred.
[02:09:46.449 --> 02:09:51.772]  And so I'm just letting you know he gives us really good intelligence over and over and over and over again.
[02:09:53.353 --> 02:09:55.194]  And so what does this British exit mean?
[02:09:55.294 --> 02:09:57.496]  Sure there's going to be shenanigans to try to keep folks in it.
[02:09:57.676 --> 02:10:02.599]  I'm not against some union if it's if it's democratic and empowers people and is just economic.
[02:10:02.999 --> 02:10:14.946]  But when it is arresting people that criticize open borders, when it's totalitarian and wants to arrest global warming deniers, like the Democratic Party platform officially says today, then we know this is an authoritarian movement
[02:10:15.606 --> 02:10:20.109]  By the big banks, through the Democrats and the Republicans, through the Labor, through the Tory.
[02:10:20.710 --> 02:10:22.311]  And this is really an awakening moment.
[02:10:22.351 --> 02:10:29.036]  But talking to Pchenik, who just joined us, he started getting into the fact that it shows the ineptitude, the arrogance, the flat-footedness.
[02:10:29.616 --> 02:10:30.217]  And I agree.
[02:10:30.317 --> 02:10:36.722]  Look at the Euro bureaucracy that's unelected, but set up from the start to rule it, because it started as a coal and steel collective.
[02:10:36.742 --> 02:10:40.024]  I mean, it started out as a technocracy, folks.
[02:10:40.344 --> 02:10:41.145]  It didn't just become one.
[02:10:42.739 --> 02:10:45.923]  They're saying we're just going to have an EU army and it's going to take over your militaries.
[02:10:46.164 --> 02:10:47.245]  We're going to start commanding them.
[02:10:47.546 --> 02:10:49.308]  The bureaucracy is going to put out a report.
[02:10:49.328 --> 02:10:51.991]  We're going to bring in new commanders over your commanders.
[02:10:52.032 --> 02:10:54.495]  Folks, that is literal occupation.
[02:10:55.096 --> 02:11:00.102]  That is like Hitler coming in and putting his French generals in over the French, the Vichy.
[02:11:00.823 --> 02:11:02.684]  I mean, I harp on that because it's what's happening.
[02:11:02.704 --> 02:11:05.126]  This is so crazy, I can't even believe it.
[02:11:05.466 --> 02:11:11.910]  And globalist policies, trying to jack up food prices worldwide, trying to bring in a crisis where these guys consolidate control.
[02:11:12.290 --> 02:11:15.112]  But what if they bring in a crisis so big it brings them down?
[02:11:16.072 --> 02:11:19.294]  By the way, I'm not sure licking my lips wanting to see the whole system crash.
[02:11:19.634 --> 02:11:28.100]  I want these evil globalists at the top to stop wrecking things and basing things on conquest and collapse instead of renaissance.
[02:11:29.033 --> 02:11:30.977]  So I'm not looking for some civil war.
[02:11:31.939 --> 02:11:36.589]  I'm not looking to, you know, just see Herman Von Ruppe and Merkel's head on a platter.
[02:11:37.483 --> 02:11:41.105]  I just realized these people aren't as smart as Napoleon or Hitler.
[02:11:41.305 --> 02:11:42.306]  They were bad guys, by the way.
[02:11:42.886 --> 02:11:50.250]  Weren't as smart as people before them, and they just think they're invincible because they're in control, and it gets more and more dangerous.
[02:11:50.290 --> 02:11:54.832]  So to cover the waterfront, and the one at a time we have is Dr. Steve Pachinik, stevepachinik.com.
[02:11:55.152 --> 02:12:04.577]  Let's walk through this history, where we are, and then I want to ask you about the global economic system, because we got FEMA reports and others saying worldwide food crises, you name it.
[02:12:04.617 --> 02:12:05.858]  Is that hype, or what's going on?
[02:12:07.219 --> 02:12:20.958]  I think it's important for the audience to understand we Americans, in 1944 because of the incredible quality of leaders that we had at that point under FDR,
[02:12:21.838 --> 02:12:36.211]  Morgenthau and others in the Treasury developed what was called the Bretton Woods Conference, which basically stated very clearly that for the next half a century to a century, we will have the dollar denominated as the currency of the world.
[02:12:36.972 --> 02:12:47.958]  That became so ingrained that anybody who has a chance to go to New Hampshire, Mount Washington, should see that little room which determined the outcome of American superpower.
[02:12:47.978 --> 02:12:53.922]  It was not only our army, it was the brilliance of men who could foresee what would happen to our country.
[02:12:54.462 --> 02:12:56.003]  Now, taking that forward,
[02:12:56.684 --> 02:13:00.046]  The French came in after World War II, although they were defeated.
[02:13:00.166 --> 02:13:03.608]  My father was in the French Army, and the first order he got was retreat.
[02:13:03.909 --> 02:13:07.111]  And unfortunately, 2.2 million men retreated.
[02:13:07.571 --> 02:13:18.718]  The reality is that France, after World War II, said to the Americans that we have to co-opt the rise of Germany, because France had been defeated twice by the Germans in World War I and II.
[02:13:19.198 --> 02:13:23.321]  So they came together on this theoretical notion, which was total nonsense.
[02:13:23.741 --> 02:13:27.766]  To co-opt the Germans by creating a United States of Europe.
[02:13:28.487 --> 02:13:41.183]  That in turn had no legitimacy, it had no concrete basis, and as Alex told you, it basically was a bunch of bureaucrats ironically put in the worst country of all, which was not really a country, Belgium.
[02:13:41.943 --> 02:13:48.649]  At the site where Napoleon was defeated in 1815, only five days before the Brexit.
[02:13:48.689 --> 02:13:54.013]  So in a way, history recapitulates itself when England and Germany defeated France.
[02:13:54.074 --> 02:13:56.896]  What this is, is the end of globalization.
[02:13:56.996 --> 02:14:04.102]  For five to ten years, I've been saying that the so-called notion of globalization is artificial and not real.
[02:14:04.262 --> 02:14:08.386]  Because what was happening is the big banks on Wall Street were in fact
[02:14:08.866 --> 02:14:11.147]  Putting their tentacles out to every country.
[02:14:11.587 --> 02:14:24.011]  However, because they're basically so arrogant and inept, like our government, and you saw this in 2008, they quickly ran with Obama to Britain and before Britain went on the Brexit, they pleaded.
[02:14:24.071 --> 02:14:27.052]  These were the major banks, not the regional and local banks.
[02:14:27.492 --> 02:14:28.413]  They're very safe.
[02:14:28.433 --> 02:14:35.837]  So Americans should understand, your local, regional banks are fine because of the reserve currencies that were mandated after 2008.
[02:14:36.918 --> 02:14:50.967]  What happened is the Goldman Sachs, the Morgan Stanleys, the big, unfortunate banks, and the corrupt ones, now had to put in their own tentacles into the different countries as opposed to going through Britain.
[02:14:51.841 --> 02:15:04.007]  Our country did not in any way anticipate that this was happening, despite the fact that I would write repeatedly, both in Cyber Command, Cyber Warfare, and the Netforce series by Tom Clancy.
[02:15:04.107 --> 02:15:09.930]  I wrote about it in Op Center when Spain broke out and Barcelona broke away from Spain.
[02:15:10.370 --> 02:15:17.454]  I kept saying it for five years on the Alex Jones Show, that this was the beginning of the end of Europe, because Europe
[02:15:17.914 --> 02:15:21.619]  It's an artificial construct that has no basis for solidity.
[02:15:22.019 --> 02:15:26.785]  It's different national characters, 28 to 29, with one currency.
[02:15:27.345 --> 02:15:34.634]  The difference is the United States has one currency for 52 states and we're unified because it's a republic.
[02:15:35.214 --> 02:15:43.818]  There may be attempts at a secession like Texas or others, but I don't think it will be successful as opposed to devolution of power.
[02:15:44.298 --> 02:15:55.804]  So what I've really been talking about, and Alex really pointed this out over the years, is not that the globalists were increasing, it's that we have a devolution of power going on all over the world.
[02:15:56.284 --> 02:16:02.589]  Including the Chinese who have the centralized power but are fighting their own corruption in the local areas.
[02:16:02.649 --> 02:16:04.090]  The Yuan is going down.
[02:16:04.190 --> 02:16:06.292]  China will not do well in this.
[02:16:06.332 --> 02:16:13.477]  They will try to attempt to make the Yuan a currency that's an alternate to the American currency of the British Pound.
[02:16:13.657 --> 02:16:14.718]  That will not happen.
[02:16:14.818 --> 02:16:16.619]  The Pound will still remain strong.
[02:16:17.039 --> 02:16:21.723]  The Euro will fall repeatedly because France has a very low growth rate.
[02:16:22.163 --> 02:16:27.808]  And it had before France even attempted to stop the Brexit, it already had riots.
[02:16:27.868 --> 02:16:30.471]  What's the calculus on bringing in all the refugees?
[02:16:31.452 --> 02:16:35.716]  Five million from the Middle East, it's gotta be hundreds of thousands if not millions here, they're covering it up.
[02:16:36.176 --> 02:16:40.941]  What is the whole point of bringing in people unskilled, 22% that have TB?
[02:16:41.361 --> 02:16:42.402]  I mean this sounds like treason.
[02:16:43.843 --> 02:16:52.648]  The way I looked at it and the way I said it on your show many years ago was that this was Putin's revenge on the takedown of the Soviet Union.
[02:16:53.328 --> 02:16:57.250]  When I listened to Putin many years ago, he's a very clever man.
[02:16:57.350 --> 02:17:03.574]  He said, imagine what countries are like when you liberate 20 million people and they have no country, i.e.
[02:17:03.974 --> 02:17:07.396]  addressing me and others who are involved in the takedown of the Soviet Union.
[02:17:07.796 --> 02:17:09.977]  And I realized that he would in fact
[02:17:10.819 --> 02:17:21.387]  Get into the Syrian war to create this conflagration, support Bashar Assad with Iran, and then allow all of these young men to transfer over into Turkey.
[02:17:21.407 --> 02:17:27.312]  Sure, and of course, he came out yesterday, Putin, and said this reminds him of the fall of the Soviet Union.
[02:17:28.253 --> 02:17:29.093]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[02:17:29.193 --> 02:17:33.517]  You see, I had anticipated it, and I warned our people, but again, they didn't listen.
[02:17:34.219 --> 02:17:40.740]  Again, our people, you know, this is the point why you are important and why the American public has time to listen to you.
[02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:44.241]  We've talked about this for years beforehand.
[02:17:44.481 --> 02:17:47.821]  I knew our government was not qualified to answer this.
[02:17:47.961 --> 02:17:54.502]  I knew our government was not even capable of anticipating any of these problems and gaming them out.
[02:17:55.283 --> 02:18:00.403]  Unlike the Nixon administration, whatever you could say for Nixon, right or wrong, the man was brilliant.
[02:18:00.584 --> 02:18:03.244]  He knew exactly how to game out the Chinese,
[02:18:03.706 --> 02:18:05.147]  How to game out the Soviets.
[02:18:05.808 --> 02:18:11.413]  Even under the Baker administration, we knew how to game out the Soviet Union under Reagan.
[02:18:11.693 --> 02:18:12.934]  Our elites don't game anybody.
[02:18:12.954 --> 02:18:14.796]  They just get bought off for almost nothing.
[02:18:14.816 --> 02:18:19.139]  I mean, they give up all the power and sovereignty for like a few million dollars apiece.
[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:20.821]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:18:21.502 --> 02:18:25.463]  Well, in effect, Alex, there is no more sovereignty, and they have no power.
[02:18:25.543 --> 02:18:31.884]  What you saw Obama doing was to really, again, basically self-destruct.
[02:18:31.924 --> 02:18:39.726]  He self-destructed with Osama bin Laden nonsense, which didn't exist, the shooting, with Sandy Hook, a false flag, with another false flag.
[02:18:39.786 --> 02:18:43.147]  So, he will be known as the sociopath that he is.
[02:18:43.327 --> 02:18:44.987]  I said it from the day he came in.
[02:18:45.567 --> 02:18:56.514]  He was a CIA recruit, a complete sociopath, whose only advantage was... Hey, we know current FBI agents that have investigated Sandy Hook and think it's a hoax.
[02:18:56.594 --> 02:18:57.334]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:18:57.815 --> 02:18:58.595]  I'm not going to get into it.
[02:18:58.615 --> 02:19:07.661]  Well, not only that, the question is, what do we do when we know that our government is tyrannical and is capable of killing us and shooting us?
[02:19:08.206 --> 02:19:09.287]  It's not just FEMA.
[02:19:09.727 --> 02:19:14.070]  The question is, really, when will we protest, and how will that protest?
[02:19:14.090 --> 02:19:16.891]  But isn't it clear that it's a criminal element inside our government?
[02:19:17.692 --> 02:19:19.353]  Well, the government is criminal.
[02:19:19.473 --> 02:19:22.775]  I mean, how do you allow our government to attack
[02:19:23.430 --> 02:19:38.952]  The print towers, when you have the CIA, the DIA, the military intelligence, you have the soldiers, you have the police, you have Homeland Security, you have the WASP trained Mueller who says, oh no, we didn't know about it, and the FBI, the most
[02:19:39.552 --> 02:19:52.682]  Self-aggrandized organization other than the CIA repeatedly making mistakes and confusing the issue and really getting part of the collusion of hitting and hurting.
[02:19:52.782 --> 02:19:54.743]  And then why are they allowing the Islamic invasion?
[02:19:54.763 --> 02:19:56.845]  Just so they can have more terror attacks and get more funding?
[02:19:57.145 --> 02:19:58.206]  I'm going to ask you that when we come back.
[02:19:58.266 --> 02:20:00.628]  Our Steve Pachinik is our guest analyzing the Brexit.
[02:20:01.647 --> 02:20:02.127]  Not a group.
[02:20:02.167 --> 02:20:03.568]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:20:03.608 --> 02:20:04.688]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:20:04.948 --> 02:20:05.869]  Why is this so good?
[02:20:06.149 --> 02:20:11.390]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:20:11.471 --> 02:20:25.035]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:20:25.075 --> 02:20:26.476]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:20:27.376 --> 02:20:28.817]  Spreading disease around.
[02:20:28.897 --> 02:20:31.379]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:20:31.479 --> 02:20:32.740]  These are all parasites.
[02:20:32.800 --> 02:20:33.881]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:20:33.901 --> 02:20:34.941]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:20:35.241 --> 02:20:41.786]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, you have enzyme blend in there.
[02:20:41.806 --> 02:20:49.831]  And this is very important because a lot of these microorganisms and even going up to tapeworms, pinworms, you have to disintegrate the lining.
[02:20:49.851 --> 02:20:51.032]  I mean on viruses are
[02:20:51.192 --> 02:20:51.352]  I don't
[02:21:11.423 --> 02:21:14.525]  But it's really hard to avoid parasites.
[02:21:15.026 --> 02:21:17.467]  It's hard to avoid attacking organisms.
[02:21:17.527 --> 02:21:19.288]  And that's where I see this going.
[02:21:19.328 --> 02:21:26.814]  I mean, I think a lot of the information that we put out there and a lot of the products that we develop are specifically for that reason.
[02:21:26.874 --> 02:21:29.435]  To protect you against the endocrine disrupting chemicals.
[02:21:29.475 --> 02:21:31.797]  To protect you against all those chemicals and toxins.
[02:21:31.997 --> 02:21:42.927]  So we actually designed the Living Defense and put in a specific blend of enzymes which actually chew and eat through the lining of these different organisms.
[02:21:43.507 --> 02:21:45.149]  So the Living Defense is amazing.
[02:21:45.569 --> 02:21:47.631]  We've seen just tremendous reviews.
[02:21:48.311 --> 02:21:50.473]  How often should you take Living Defense?
[02:21:50.553 --> 02:21:51.854]  I mean, is it a regimen every day?
[02:21:51.914 --> 02:21:53.736]  That's what I was doing until we ran out.
[02:21:54.076 --> 02:21:55.798]  Or do you do it heavier for certain cleanses?
[02:21:55.818 --> 02:21:56.619]  What do you do, Dr. Group?
[02:21:57.319 --> 02:22:08.906]  Well, I do usually six weeks at a time because if you look at the life cycle of most parasites, it's six weeks from the time... So you gotta kill the ones that are in there and then kill their babies when they hatch up.
[02:22:09.207 --> 02:22:19.093]  If you're suffering from abdominal pain, allergies, even like headaches, anemia, weakened immune system, gut problems, depression, hair loss,
[02:22:20.153 --> 02:22:23.774]  Excess gas, muscle pain, nervousness, I mean all these things.
[02:22:23.834 --> 02:22:41.917]  If you look at some of these conditions and then us opening up our borders and all the other countries opening up their borders, you're just dealing with a mass amount of parasites or harmful organisms or biological weapons that are spreading and mutating all across the world.
[02:22:41.937 --> 02:22:46.058]  And I think that's one of the reasons why, I mean, all you have to do is look at the news these days.
[02:22:46.638 --> 02:22:49.060]  You can type in refugees spreading disease.
[02:22:49.120 --> 02:22:51.422]  I mean the CDC is going crazy right now.
[02:22:52.042 --> 02:22:56.445]  There's a new antibiotic resistant E. coli that they just identified.
[02:22:56.565 --> 02:22:57.666]  Doctors don't know.
[02:22:57.746 --> 02:23:01.389]  They don't teach doctors in medical school about parasites and harmful organisms.
[02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:03.550]  There's a reason why they don't teach them about that.
[02:23:03.630 --> 02:23:06.853]  Just like they don't teach doctors about the root cause of disease.
[02:23:07.353 --> 02:23:09.594]  And how to eliminate all disease out there.
[02:23:09.655 --> 02:23:11.035]  They don't want you to know about it.
[02:23:11.296 --> 02:23:13.997]  You don't want your own immune system being attacked.
[02:23:14.277 --> 02:23:17.660]  Again, you know, you have animals, especially your cats, dogs.
[02:23:17.700 --> 02:23:19.561]  So many people have pets these days.
[02:23:20.021 --> 02:23:21.442]  People eat raw sushi.
[02:23:21.842 --> 02:23:23.463]  People eat more raw food.
[02:23:23.503 --> 02:23:27.666]  You have all these different organisms showing up in the water supplies now.
[02:23:28.206 --> 02:23:31.547]  You even have it in the air supplies, these tiny microorganisms.
[02:23:31.567 --> 02:23:34.409]  So it's not like we can get away from them.
[02:23:34.449 --> 02:23:35.929]  We just have to do everything.
[02:23:36.009 --> 02:23:39.691]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:23:39.771 --> 02:23:40.031]  All right.
[02:23:40.071 --> 02:23:42.912]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:23:42.932 --> 02:23:43.932]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:23:43.973 --> 02:23:44.513]  Living Defense.
[02:23:44.813 --> 02:23:45.853]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:23:45.913 --> 02:23:46.934]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:23:46.954 --> 02:23:47.674]  It's full of stuff.
[02:23:47.734 --> 02:23:49.035]  It's great for your body, period.
[02:23:49.675 --> 02:23:51.536]  And you support the broadcast.
[02:23:51.596 --> 02:23:52.676]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:23:52.956 --> 02:23:54.837]  Thank you, Dr. Green from the Global Healing Center.
[02:23:55.217 --> 02:23:57.178]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:24:15.740 --> 02:24:17.001]  Final segment with our guest.
[02:24:17.101 --> 02:24:18.462]  I was going to take calls the next segment.
[02:24:18.482 --> 02:24:18.763]  You know what?
[02:24:18.783 --> 02:24:19.083]  I forgot.
[02:24:19.103 --> 02:24:25.369]  We've got a reporter down in the valley where they're admittedly bringing in illegal aliens and putting them on buses.
[02:24:25.389 --> 02:24:26.469]  Now, we broke that two years ago.
[02:24:26.530 --> 02:24:27.330]  Nobody else covered it.
[02:24:27.991 --> 02:24:28.731]  And that's a big deal.
[02:24:28.751 --> 02:24:29.652]  It shows the lawlessness.
[02:24:29.712 --> 02:24:31.494]  But now it's on ABC News.
[02:24:31.534 --> 02:24:33.295]  So we thought we'd go back down there and show folks.
[02:24:34.036 --> 02:24:37.080]  So, Ja'Kari Jackson, Madame Salazar and others joining us.
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:40.504]  Caught red-handed, Border Patrol paying to ship illegals deep in the United States.
[02:24:40.544 --> 02:24:41.425]  This is the lawlessness.
[02:24:41.745 --> 02:24:45.389]  Look at the Sunday Express headline, European Superstate to be unveiled.
[02:24:46.170 --> 02:24:51.276]  EU, we told you this last week, EU nations to be, quote, morphed into one post-Brexit.
[02:24:51.296 --> 02:24:52.717]  So you don't have an excuse to leave now.
[02:24:53.218 --> 02:24:54.199]  We'll fix that problem.
[02:24:55.060 --> 02:24:57.821]  So this shows the incredible totalitarian nature.
[02:24:58.401 --> 02:25:01.703]  And obviously this will just accelerate people wanting to leave even more.
[02:25:02.623 --> 02:25:04.504]  But what is it about tyrants, Dr. Pucinich?
[02:25:04.544 --> 02:25:05.724]  They just don't get it.
[02:25:05.744 --> 02:25:12.207]  It's like Catalonia or Catalan, one of the only prosperous areas in Spain, its own culture.
[02:25:12.227 --> 02:25:14.468]  97% of people voted to leave.
[02:25:15.108 --> 02:25:16.148]  Madrid said you can't.
[02:25:16.308 --> 02:25:17.569]  They just said we'll do whatever we want.
[02:25:17.589 --> 02:25:18.469]  I mean, how do you stop 90%?
[02:25:19.530 --> 02:25:21.810]  You can't control 90% and make them do what you want.
[02:25:22.031 --> 02:25:22.891]  You can only kill them.
[02:25:26.644 --> 02:25:36.573]  Yeah, the reason I knew Catalonia would break away from Madrid, number one, Madrid is an artificial construct created by Francis II, a French king.
[02:25:36.673 --> 02:25:37.714]  There is no Spain.
[02:25:37.795 --> 02:25:43.420]  It's really Valencia, Basque, Barcelona, as you know, and I wrote about Catalan breaking away.
[02:25:44.139 --> 02:25:52.721]  The problem in Spain will be that it had a civil war during the 30s, millions died, and it could have another civil war, because the Catalans are not Spanish.
[02:25:53.141 --> 02:25:59.003]  They will fight if they have to, and Madrid doesn't have a national force that can really counteract it.
[02:25:59.543 --> 02:26:05.665]  What happens to tyrants is they see the, you know, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[02:26:06.165 --> 02:26:11.006]  But in that premise, what people don't realize, it's the beginning of the end of the tyrant.
[02:26:11.554 --> 02:26:23.717]  The minute the tyrant exercises that kind of absolute power like Obama's doing, like those henchmen around him, then it becomes the end of their dynasty and then the end of their tenure.
[02:26:24.197 --> 02:26:24.858]  What happens?
[02:26:25.078 --> 02:26:30.039]  Putin understands very well in the history of the Romanovs and the Tsars and Stalin,
[02:26:30.539 --> 02:26:34.362]  The only way the tyrants leave is through assassination or death.
[02:26:34.782 --> 02:26:35.802]  There is no other way.
[02:26:36.283 --> 02:26:52.713]  In the United States, we either assassinate our presidents, which we've done with LBJ, we had shootings, which we did with JFK, and we warned LBJ not to continue, and we told Reagan that he has a problem, and then we went on and so forth.
[02:26:52.793 --> 02:26:55.895]  Things just don't happen by chance or accident.
[02:26:56.480 --> 02:26:58.421]  Now we have a corrupt government.
[02:26:58.481 --> 02:26:59.882]  We have an inept government.
[02:27:00.042 --> 02:27:04.445]  That's worse because corruption may be needed in order to get systems going.
[02:27:04.505 --> 02:27:06.046]  It's just the degree of corruption.
[02:27:06.527 --> 02:27:19.055]  But when you have incompetence to the top, Susan Rice, Samantha Power, the Ben Rhodes, all those people who really have no idea what they're doing, and they stood in one of those think tanks, it's time to get rid of all of them.
[02:27:19.676 --> 02:27:20.116]  The Trump
[02:27:20.839 --> 02:27:38.143]  You know, attempt to come into the presidency is far more important than people realize, not only because he said the system is rigged, but he clearly articulated in words what you have been doing, what I have been doing, and many millions of others have said we're disgusted with the rigged system.
[02:27:38.643 --> 02:27:40.783]  Nevertheless, the rigged system continues.
[02:27:40.883 --> 02:27:44.644]  If Hillary comes in, my suspicion is there will be violence.
[02:27:45.553 --> 02:27:59.391]  I, you know, I can't proffer it, but they know, the people who are listening to me, that they were more than effective in handing me subpoenas, or when they felt I was out of control, they sent helicopters above my house.
[02:27:59.966 --> 02:28:00.887]  To give me a warning.
[02:28:01.107 --> 02:28:08.013]  Now, I don't have a problem fighting against our nation, for my nation, and our republic, because I had to fight overseas.
[02:28:08.553 --> 02:28:11.216]  But I call on our military to wake up.
[02:28:11.416 --> 02:28:15.940]  I call on our generals to stop worrying about their pensions and their liability.
[02:28:16.280 --> 02:28:21.284]  Right now, we have more generals who are on pension than active duty military officers.
[02:28:21.785 --> 02:28:22.746]  And that's a crime.
[02:28:23.306 --> 02:28:27.429]  And instead, we don't have an army that really is loyal to the Republic.
[02:28:27.529 --> 02:28:31.972]  What the Republic did and Obama did was a very shrewd and clever element.
[02:28:32.032 --> 02:28:43.020]  They create strategic tension all over the world so that our military is deployed, not because they have to fight for the Republic, but it's a way of getting rid of our military domestically.
[02:28:43.180 --> 02:28:45.482]  So we're in 786 bases.
[02:28:45.962 --> 02:28:48.304]  Then you asked, why are these false flags occurring?
[02:28:48.874 --> 02:29:02.618]  You hit it on the head repeatedly when you said it was to round up our ammunition and guns, but there's a more serious reason and a more perfidious reason that I have maintained throughout, and that is what I wrote in the State of Emergency.
[02:29:03.279 --> 02:29:10.121]  Our government can no longer justify its existence without creating strategic tension within our country.
[02:29:10.281 --> 02:29:10.901]  In other words,
[02:29:11.341 --> 02:29:14.883]  The federal government, sui generis, has no legitimacy.
[02:29:15.364 --> 02:29:20.027]  It has to create strategic tensions so that it can mandate its federal troops.
[02:29:20.047 --> 02:29:23.109]  Sure, it has to make itself the hero and violate jurisdictions.
[02:29:23.129 --> 02:29:30.114]  If you could do like four more minutes on the other side, I want to ask you, not as a pop psychiatrist, but also a medical doctor, Harvard and MIT trained,
[02:29:30.894 --> 02:29:36.615]  I want to ask you just briefly about a Merkel, about an Obama, about, I mean, who these people are, why they're so dishonorable.
[02:29:37.275 --> 02:29:40.196]  Why, I mean, the most scummiest people get in power.
[02:29:40.236 --> 02:29:41.236]  Stay right there, Dr. Patrenik.
[02:29:41.276 --> 02:29:41.876]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:42.177 --> 02:29:50.138]  And then Jakari Jackson, Adon Salazar, and other reporters in the Valley, where the UN is ordering and directing unnamed migrants to just be let in.
[02:29:50.598 --> 02:29:51.499]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.999 --> 02:29:53.599]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.519 --> 02:29:57.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.407 --> 02:30:01.007]  No problem.
[02:30:01.688 --> 02:30:03.069]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:04.650]  You can't survive without it.
[02:30:04.830 --> 02:30:05.730]  But where do you get it?
[02:30:06.031 --> 02:30:11.794]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:30:12.014 --> 02:30:17.738]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:30:17.918 --> 02:30:34.786]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:30:35.186 --> 02:30:37.307]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:30:37.667 --> 02:30:38.868]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:30:39.148 --> 02:30:39.908]  Easy assembly.
[02:30:40.189 --> 02:30:40.809]  Low maintenance.
[02:30:41.089 --> 02:30:42.910]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[02:31:01.840 --> 02:31:04.923]  Finally, the mainstream media is reporting on what we broke two years ago.
[02:31:05.083 --> 02:31:05.444]  The U.S.
[02:31:05.484 --> 02:31:12.711]  Customs and Border Patrol, under pressure from the Obama administration, is purchasing bus tickets for illegals to ship them deeper into the country at taxpayers' expense.
[02:31:12.911 --> 02:31:19.718]  Local news station KRGV is now covering how the McAllen, Texas bus station is used as a transit hub for illegals Obama is bringing into the country.
[02:31:19.878 --> 02:31:24.722]  Which InfoWars.com exclusively broke in 2014 when no one else dared to report on it.
[02:31:24.822 --> 02:31:29.246]  KRGVA revealed that over 100 illegals a day are being dropped off at the McAllen station.
[02:31:29.506 --> 02:31:37.192]  And, in 2014, InfoWars reported on how the Obama administration was ordering the Border Patrol to release illegals they've apprehended after crossing the border.
[02:31:37.293 --> 02:31:45.960]  But, as part of their release, the illegals are transported to the McAllen bus station by Border Patrol agents who then buy them tickets to go wherever they want to go in the U.S.
[02:31:46.300 --> 02:31:49.922]  So, for example, if the illegals have relatives in Boston, that's where they get to go.
[02:31:50.142 --> 02:31:53.123]  And taxpayers are paying for this illegal smuggling operation.
[02:31:53.283 --> 02:31:57.005]  To find out more about Obama's lawlessness, visit InfoWars.com.
[02:31:57.165 --> 02:31:58.466]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[02:32:01.496 --> 02:32:09.943]  Both GOP nominee Donald Trump and leftist investor George Soros have predicted the complete downfall of the European Union, despite Trump being a nationalist and Soros a globalist.
[02:32:10.084 --> 02:32:19.752]  The two billionaires both independently declared that they believe a domino effect has been started by Britain's decision to leave the EU, and the process will be difficult for anyone to stop, as reported by Steve Watson.
[02:32:19.892 --> 02:32:20.753]  Soros said, quote,
[02:32:20.953 --> 02:32:26.498]  Now the catastrophic scenario that many feared has materialized, making the disintegration of the EU practically irreversible.
[02:32:26.678 --> 02:32:35.045]  Trump also predicted a complete breakup of the EU and also warned that the continent would be completely unrecognizable within 10 years if strict immigration controls are not enacted.
[02:32:35.206 --> 02:32:37.648]  Trump told reporters, quote, The people have spoken.
[02:32:37.748 --> 02:32:39.189]  I think the EU is going to break up.
[02:32:39.349 --> 02:32:42.312]  I think the EU might break up before anyone thinks in terms of Scotland.
[02:32:42.452 --> 02:32:46.156]  Trump is referring to the resistance Scottish politicians are still giving Brexit.
[02:32:46.337 --> 02:32:48.819]  He continued, stating that, For more news, visit InfoWars.com.
[02:32:48.840 --> 02:32:49.901]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[02:33:14.571 --> 02:33:20.877]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:38.087 --> 02:33:38.728]  Welcome back.
[02:33:39.108 --> 02:33:45.354]  Jakari Jackson and others are getting in place down in South Texas in McAllen, where the UN's running the illegal alien invasion.
[02:33:45.374 --> 02:33:46.135]  They're actually selling news.
[02:33:46.435 --> 02:33:51.700]  The UN advised us, the UN comes in, they're illegal, and then we just put them on buses and ship them wherever they want.
[02:33:52.529 --> 02:34:03.014]  But when I came in from Isla Mujeres, took my children fishing for five, six days, they interrogated every one of them and asked them, what'd you buy, what'd you do, where'd you go?
[02:34:03.054 --> 02:34:04.534]  And the guy knew full well who I was.
[02:34:04.554 --> 02:34:08.996]  Had a big X on my little, you know, computer printout when I went through that first.
[02:34:09.937 --> 02:34:12.938]  And as it does every time, and I got to be interrogated.
[02:34:14.219 --> 02:34:16.580]  But if I'd been wearing a burka over my head, there wouldn't be any problem.
[02:34:17.748 --> 02:34:26.734]  And again, I'm not here to start some war with the Muslims, but if I could point out they've got rights I don't have, and that this whole thing's security theater, maybe I could get my freedoms back.
[02:34:26.754 --> 02:34:35.479]  Because all I see with this police state is domesticating me, that I have no rights, I have no freedoms, and I need to worship some all-powerful centralized government.
[02:34:36.749 --> 02:34:45.634]  And that's why I'm trying to get people self-sufficient, I'm trying to get folks to take action, and get involved in their communities, to take back our nation by being productive, by being honorable.
[02:34:46.154 --> 02:34:48.696]  Now, we're going to go to our reporters here in a few minutes, but Dr. Pchenik,
[02:34:49.933 --> 02:34:51.514]  Again, you're not just a pop psychologist.
[02:34:51.534 --> 02:34:52.855]  You're not just a psychiatrist.
[02:34:53.435 --> 02:34:56.656]  Harvard-trained, MIT, politics, you name it.
[02:34:56.676 --> 02:35:00.278]  I'm going to go over your whole pedigree for listeners, but it's very extensive, obviously.
[02:35:00.298 --> 02:35:02.880]  And they can't stand the fact you come on the show.
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:04.420]  I've been visited by the government about it.
[02:35:04.480 --> 02:35:05.141]  You've been visited.
[02:35:05.161 --> 02:35:07.262]  And then people say, well, why don't you tell us all about it?
[02:35:07.282 --> 02:35:10.904]  Well, you did put the subpoena online and talk about it and go through it all.
[02:35:11.164 --> 02:35:13.485]  I just sit there and just leave it where it's at.
[02:35:14.045 --> 02:35:17.387]  And just laugh at people, basically, because all I'm doing is basic good stuff.
[02:35:17.427 --> 02:35:17.988]  I'm a good guy.
[02:35:18.008 --> 02:35:20.769]  And, you know, trying to save this country, because I live here.
[02:35:21.210 --> 02:35:21.950]  My kids live here.
[02:35:21.970 --> 02:35:23.911]  And, you know, my ancestors lived here.
[02:35:23.971 --> 02:35:27.734]  And I just really, you know, don't have it out for the average person.
[02:35:27.754 --> 02:35:29.175]  I just want to have a free nation.
[02:35:30.115 --> 02:35:34.718]  But look at the psychology of the sycophants, the Obamas, the Hillarys, and others.
[02:35:34.898 --> 02:35:37.960]  I mean, they just want to mount America's head on the wall.
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:39.321]  They really are after the bitter clingers.
[02:35:39.361 --> 02:35:41.983]  They really hate people that are independent.
[02:35:42.643 --> 02:35:43.803]  Of any race, color, or creed.
[02:35:43.843 --> 02:35:59.926]  I mean, they really do want to physically dominate what was Americana, even though that's what ends up generating the power of the nation that these parasites basically control and siphon off of and ride to global control.
[02:36:00.346 --> 02:36:06.387]  So I don't understand the schizophrenic behavior or the self-destructive behavior of them just seeming like they're out to get us.
[02:36:06.427 --> 02:36:09.008]  I mean, they even say they are when their internal memos come out.
[02:36:10.088 --> 02:36:11.009]  A, is that correct?
[02:36:11.089 --> 02:36:20.235]  Just a few minutes on the psychology of these people as somebody that wrote the book on State Department psychological operations who helped get the Camp David Accord done and you know so much more.
[02:36:20.255 --> 02:36:23.757]  I mean you really are somebody that actually knows what's going on, not pop garbage.
[02:36:23.797 --> 02:36:26.259]  So just a brief synopsis of these people.
[02:36:27.216 --> 02:36:28.857]  Well, number one, they're not crazy.
[02:36:28.977 --> 02:36:32.180]  But let's get it very clear, and your audience has to understand it.
[02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:33.441]  They're not schizophrenic.
[02:36:33.501 --> 02:36:35.243]  There's nothing psychotic about them.
[02:36:35.303 --> 02:36:39.346]  These are very willful, determined sociopaths.
[02:36:39.446 --> 02:36:46.312]  Sociopaths meaning that by definition they grew up not caring about guilt, responsibility, or accountability.
[02:36:46.352 --> 02:36:49.835]  So once you have that dynamic in there, you have entitlement.
[02:36:50.015 --> 02:36:53.718]  Once you have entitlement, that means that you should be voting for me.
[02:36:53.778 --> 02:36:54.959]  Then you go to pandering.
[02:36:55.938 --> 02:37:01.200]  Most, like Obama and Hillary and Bill Clinton, all have the same dynamics.
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:10.663]  Sociopathy, lies of their histories, lies about their own self-identity, and basically they pander for favors.
[02:37:10.883 --> 02:37:16.505]  In turn, a system like the CIA or intelligence system can recruit them very quickly.
[02:37:16.946 --> 02:37:23.588]  When they're young, it was done with Obama because he was black, his mother was an operative, his grandfather was, his grandmother.
[02:37:24.088 --> 02:37:37.691]  And the same thing with Bill Clinton and MENA and throughout his own history when he had to go to Oxford and stroke Talbot was his roommate who was classical CIA from Yale who cleaned up all the junk that Bill Clinton did.
[02:37:37.811 --> 02:37:46.693]  And the same thing with Hillary who has her own sexual problems, has a history of lesbianism, has a history of entitlement corruption and ineptness.
[02:37:46.934 --> 02:37:48.634]  Once you have that dynamic
[02:37:49.352 --> 02:37:58.237]  The ability of the power of the state through covert actions is very easy to manipulate these people and bring in the necessary...
[02:38:01.260 --> 02:38:02.581]  Do what we want you to do.
[02:38:02.881 --> 02:38:04.182]  Do what we want you to do.
[02:38:04.322 --> 02:38:06.444]  And if you don't, we'll get rid of you.
[02:38:06.824 --> 02:38:13.830]  But the only way they're terminated is the same way Putin understood about the Romanovs, about Tsar Nicholas, and about Stalin.
[02:38:14.250 --> 02:38:17.913]  They die or they leave office.
[02:38:17.993 --> 02:38:19.634]  They will not resign on their own.
[02:38:20.115 --> 02:38:21.796]  Obama is not crazy.
[02:38:21.816 --> 02:38:22.697]  He's not sick.
[02:38:22.737 --> 02:38:23.377]  He's inept.
[02:38:23.457 --> 02:38:24.398]  He's arrogant.
[02:38:24.438 --> 02:38:25.279]  He's entitled.
[02:38:25.299 --> 02:38:26.360]  He's a sociopath.
[02:38:26.380 --> 02:38:27.861]  But there's nothing crazy about him.
[02:38:28.181 --> 02:38:29.202]  He's not very bright.
[02:38:29.782 --> 02:38:44.006]  The fact that he went to Occidental College, where all of my ex-CIA operatives teach, and the fact he did not go to Columbia, went to Harvard on affirmative action means that he was there because he's black and he can articulate all kinds of nonsense.
[02:38:44.486 --> 02:38:45.826]  Same thing with Bill Clinton.
[02:38:45.966 --> 02:38:52.548]  Never showed up at Oxford, was in Moscow, worked for the agency, reported to guys who were in the agency.
[02:38:52.748 --> 02:38:59.396]  Sure, so let me ask this in closing, and I want to have you back up on this whole history sometime, because it's intriguing, and I know what you're giving us is unfiltered, you know, from your own research.
[02:38:59.417 --> 02:39:02.180]  What you see is the truth, which, from my research, is incredibly accurate.
[02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:05.404]  This is somebody on the outside studying this and watching it closely.
[02:39:06.726 --> 02:39:08.288]  Who runs the CIA, then?
[02:39:08.328 --> 02:39:11.291]  I mean, I know it was the Wall Street, the big megabanks that set it up.
[02:39:12.105 --> 02:39:12.545]  It was.
[02:39:12.665 --> 02:39:17.387]  It was the Dulles brothers to begin with who worked with the Germans during World War II.
[02:39:17.467 --> 02:39:19.628]  Then it was James Jesus Angleton.
[02:39:19.668 --> 02:39:20.589]  It was the Wasps.
[02:39:20.849 --> 02:39:25.431]  Eventually it came to the Catholics in what we call Catholics in Action.
[02:39:25.471 --> 02:39:29.253]  In this particular case, over about 20 years, it's been John Brennan.
[02:39:29.893 --> 02:39:38.516]  Who's been a special assistant to Obama and Bush Jr., who came out of Saudi Arabia, has a very checkered history of effectiveness.
[02:39:38.737 --> 02:39:42.078]  Even in the intelligence community, he's known as not being very effective.
[02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:50.384]  The Pope Francis, or is this a separate Catholic?
[02:39:50.404 --> 02:39:55.791]  Well, the Pope Francis, as I told you and I told the audience, I knew him when he was the Director of the Jesuits.
[02:39:55.831 --> 02:40:01.358]  He's a ruthless, cunning, pandering individual who doesn't deserve to be the Pope.
[02:40:01.818 --> 02:40:05.223]  And I have great respect for Catholics, but I have no respect for the Pope.
[02:40:05.783 --> 02:40:20.279]  He allowed two of his Jesuits to be arrested and several of the nuns to be killed and I was asked to come in by the Argentinian colonels to help out and I said, no, I will not incarcerate 6,000 Catholics in Argentina.
[02:40:20.319 --> 02:40:23.042]  So the Pope is also one of those sociopaths.
[02:40:23.502 --> 02:40:29.248]  Who instead of coming through as grandiose, does the reverse, which is exactly grandiose.
[02:40:29.268 --> 02:40:37.257]  He says, oh no, I'm not worthy, and then uses all of the nonsense about hope and faith, what we call reaction formation.
[02:40:44.645 --> 02:40:45.566]  I mean, people can call your name.
[02:41:03.203 --> 02:41:03.564]  Yes, I will.
[02:41:20.236 --> 02:41:21.517]  That guy is so interesting, folks.
[02:41:21.597 --> 02:41:23.319]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:41:24.479 --> 02:41:33.587]  That guy's been, like, the whole nine yards, from the ground-level assassin right up to heavy operations, and right at the start of Delta Force advising their psychological warfare operations.
[02:41:34.568 --> 02:41:35.348]  It's just incredible.
[02:41:36.089 --> 02:41:37.930]  And they just hate it when it comes on.
[02:41:37.950 --> 02:41:39.511]  They just cannot stand it.
[02:41:40.112 --> 02:41:43.375]  I have been threatened by the Israeli Mossad.
[02:41:44.035 --> 02:41:48.419]  I have been threatened by the CIA, personally, to my face, okay?
[02:41:49.614 --> 02:41:50.374]  About having him on.
[02:41:50.975 --> 02:41:54.857]  I have been, you name it, I have just been, they cannot stand it.
[02:41:55.898 --> 02:41:58.739]  And look, all we're doing is here exposing the stuff that's going on.
[02:41:59.499 --> 02:42:05.263]  Look, Jakari Jackson two years ago with Adon Salazar and Kit Daniels went down the border.
[02:42:05.663 --> 02:42:07.264]  We got contacted by the Border Patrol.
[02:42:07.484 --> 02:42:08.224]  They're the good guys.
[02:42:09.705 --> 02:42:11.766]  And said, yeah, we're completing the smuggling process.
[02:42:11.786 --> 02:42:15.628]  We blurred out the ICE agent's face, or just sat in the truck and talked to him.
[02:42:15.648 --> 02:42:16.449]  She couldn't even see the body.
[02:42:17.662 --> 02:42:22.383]  Scrambled his voice, and he sent us over there, June 26th.
[02:42:23.723 --> 02:42:36.787]  We posted a flashback of this, but this was June of 2014, where it shows dozens of buses a day, hundreds and hundreds of people, whole families, none of them vetted, not checked for diseases, from all over the world, just let in.
[02:42:38.547 --> 02:42:42.408]  Caught red-handed, Border Patrol paying to ship illegals deep into the U.S.
[02:42:42.488 --> 02:42:46.989]  And I'm not going to play the whole seven-minute report, play about a minute of it, go to Jakari, but they're down there to just point out
[02:42:48.359 --> 02:42:49.219]  And talk to the locals.
[02:42:49.319 --> 02:42:51.820]  What do you think of they're not tested for disease?
[02:42:51.860 --> 02:42:52.561]  That's number one.
[02:42:52.581 --> 02:42:55.422]  22% increase in TB in, quote, migrants.
[02:42:57.003 --> 02:42:57.883]  They're coming in.
[02:42:57.923 --> 02:43:02.505]  They check you when you come through the border at customs as a citizen, but they're not checking these people.
[02:43:03.825 --> 02:43:04.726]  It's against the law.
[02:43:04.806 --> 02:43:06.406]  The Supreme Court ruled you can't do it.
[02:43:07.027 --> 02:43:08.887]  Last week, Obama says he's going to continue.
[02:43:10.328 --> 02:43:13.269]  I mean, I sat there going through customs Saturday, and I didn't start arguing.
[02:43:13.289 --> 02:43:14.950]  I just said, you know you.
[02:43:14.970 --> 02:43:16.310]  They just let everybody in if they're illegal.
[02:43:16.330 --> 02:43:17.291]  And the guy just said, yeah.
[02:43:18.977 --> 02:43:20.598]  I mean, we've talked to the Border Patrol at the checkpoint.
[02:43:20.618 --> 02:43:22.400]  Why do you want to search at 70 miles into the U.S.?
[02:43:22.720 --> 02:43:24.161]  Come back from Big Bend, the border's open.
[02:43:24.181 --> 02:43:25.502]  He goes, yeah, you're actually right.
[02:43:25.542 --> 02:43:25.982]  Go on in.
[02:43:28.024 --> 02:43:29.785]  But there's terrorists coming into the country.
[02:43:29.825 --> 02:43:30.525]  See, that's what I mean.
[02:43:30.545 --> 02:43:31.406]  This doesn't make sense.
[02:43:31.686 --> 02:43:35.109]  So here's a minute of Jokari's report where he's talking to the emergency manager of McAllen.
[02:43:35.349 --> 02:43:38.992]  Why this is important is on Friday, U.N.
[02:43:39.292 --> 02:43:41.113]  says more Central Americans headed to the U.S.
[02:43:41.413 --> 02:43:47.538]  And the first thing they say in the newscast is, illegals are coming in, they're illegal, but they're sent here by the Border Patrol and are just bussed out.
[02:43:48.683 --> 02:43:50.424]  And they make it like it's a wonderful thing.
[02:43:50.524 --> 02:43:51.845]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:43:52.285 --> 02:43:58.408]  If I sneak an illegal in, we're talking five years in federal prison if I get a light sentence, folks.
[02:43:59.469 --> 02:44:03.911]  So we're talking to Jakari Jackson in just a moment, but he's really just there to get all these reports and go with those angles.
[02:44:04.752 --> 02:44:06.833]  Hey, what about the diseases coming in?
[02:44:07.693 --> 02:44:09.214]  What about citizens having to get checked?
[02:44:09.734 --> 02:44:11.115]  What about this not being covered in the media?
[02:44:11.175 --> 02:44:12.056]  Why is it finally being covered?
[02:44:12.096 --> 02:44:13.176]  I want to talk to the TV station.
[02:44:13.396 --> 02:44:14.617]  I want to talk to the emergency manager again.
[02:44:14.817 --> 02:44:15.958]  And this is just two years later.
[02:44:15.998 --> 02:44:16.918]  It's still every day, hundreds.
[02:44:17.078 --> 02:44:17.999]  They're there at the bus terminal.
[02:44:19.124 --> 02:44:21.747]  So let's play a clip of Jakari two years ago.
[02:44:21.807 --> 02:44:22.168]  Here it is.
[02:44:22.868 --> 02:44:24.911]  The people who you're housing here, where are they coming from?
[02:44:26.045 --> 02:44:27.987]  I'm being told they're coming from Central America.
[02:44:28.007 --> 02:44:29.468]  A lot of them are Central America.
[02:44:29.488 --> 02:44:35.193]  A lot of them are younger kids with their moms for the most part.
[02:44:35.714 --> 02:44:36.714]  And why Central America?
[02:44:36.754 --> 02:44:38.276]  Why is that the popular destination?
[02:44:38.296 --> 02:44:38.956]  I have no idea.
[02:44:39.317 --> 02:44:48.224]  What happened today in particular is that the Border Patrol dropped off some, they call them detainees, but obviously they're not detained after they drop them off.
[02:44:48.705 --> 02:44:53.349]  And normally they have tickets or arranged transportation to go somewhere in the interior.
[02:44:53.949 --> 02:45:01.692]  Well today, apparently for some logistical reasons, some of them hadn't had transportation arranged, or their transportation is tomorrow.
[02:45:01.912 --> 02:45:02.133]  Right.
[02:45:02.553 --> 02:45:04.193]  Gavin, stop right there.
[02:45:04.554 --> 02:45:07.275]  Now, 70% are underage, 18 or younger.
[02:45:07.715 --> 02:45:08.655]  That's the Fed's own numbers.
[02:45:08.675 --> 02:45:09.576]  We're on the Jakarta right now.
[02:45:11.297 --> 02:45:17.360]  The new video we have from this ABC, they're almost all, look like men and women, hardly any kids this time.
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:18.501]  Or teenagers.
[02:45:19.281 --> 02:45:23.823]  So again folks, this is a set deal, outside the law, and they're keeping the numbers secret.
[02:45:24.163 --> 02:45:28.626]  Jakari, I know you just got down there in the last 30 minutes or so, and you're about to file your reports for the Nightly News.
[02:45:28.766 --> 02:45:31.187]  Great job breaking this two years ago to you and Adon.
[02:45:31.967 --> 02:45:33.828]  But the mainstream media knows, they've been covering up.
[02:45:34.308 --> 02:45:35.249]  What have you learned so far?
[02:45:36.550 --> 02:45:40.612]  Chikara Jackson reporting from McAllen, Texas as you hear the report right there.
[02:45:40.752 --> 02:45:56.558]  It finally seems that the mainstream media is getting around to cover a story that we talked about two years ago about how many people who enter the country illegally are being provided with travel vouchers courtesy of the United States government and they go wherever they go and most of them don't return for their
[02:45:56.988 --> 02:45:57.689]  For their court dates.
[02:45:58.089 --> 02:45:59.870]  And that's the situation that's going on here.
[02:46:00.511 --> 02:46:03.993]  Currently, while we're at the McAllen bus station, there isn't too much traffic right here.
[02:46:04.614 --> 02:46:11.099]  We do know that the people are being provided with travel vouchers, but just the simple fact that they are given a voucher makes it very difficult to identify.
[02:46:11.179 --> 02:46:16.183]  So you don't know exactly who came in with a travel voucher, who didn't, and where they're going from here.
[02:46:17.784 --> 02:46:24.469]  Jakari, just as a citizen, what is it like for you, when I know you recently went on a trip to do some investigations in Asia,
[02:46:25.854 --> 02:46:39.631]  What is it like to, because you're a citizen, to be discriminated against, to be asked all these questions and go through naked body scanners, but then even at the airports they admit with a lot of the illegals that they're just groveling to them from China, you name it, just they don't even search them.
[02:46:39.652 --> 02:46:41.394]  They just let them in without even having IDs.
[02:46:41.434 --> 02:46:42.175]  I mean, that's crazy.
[02:46:43.035 --> 02:46:48.916]  Well it is rather absurd because when I returned to the states, I believe I was at JFK, and you know, I'm a U.S.
[02:46:48.936 --> 02:46:53.597]  citizen, I have my passport, you know, ID and all that, and the guy's giving me the third degree like I deserve it.
[02:46:53.977 --> 02:46:54.738]  Like, where'd you come from?
[02:46:54.778 --> 02:46:55.498]  Did you bring anything back?
[02:46:55.558 --> 02:46:57.238]  And he was like, did you go business or pleasure?
[02:46:57.258 --> 02:46:58.438]  And he just was like grilling me.
[02:46:58.718 --> 02:47:00.339]  I was like, bro, I'm from Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[02:47:00.359 --> 02:47:02.459]  Like, what do you think I was out there doing?
[02:47:02.499 --> 02:47:04.240]  I have a Christian cross on my arm.
[02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:05.120]  What do you think I'm up to?
[02:47:06.740 --> 02:47:14.623]  That's the situation I have, but as you demonstrated in your example, there are many other people who come from other countries who don't have to go through the same harassment I do as an American citizen.
[02:47:16.884 --> 02:47:18.785]  Well, I mean, I threw out the three things I want you to cover.
[02:47:18.825 --> 02:47:22.127]  The disease, the above the law, the open borders, the U.N.
[02:47:22.187 --> 02:47:25.188]  calling the shots, because we played a clip last week where the U.N.
[02:47:25.288 --> 02:47:27.589]  admits they're running the migration to Europe and here.
[02:47:27.609 --> 02:47:28.949]  That's who Obama takes his orders from.
[02:47:28.969 --> 02:47:32.391]  I mean, what about the angle of Obama just ignoring the Supreme Court again?
[02:47:33.698 --> 02:47:36.179]  Obama doesn't get his authority from the Supreme Court.
[02:47:36.199 --> 02:47:37.700]  According to him, he gets it from the U.N.
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:44.184]  So he doesn't have to abide by any of the laws of the land regardless of what the people of the United States collectively speak.
[02:47:44.204 --> 02:47:47.806]  He just ignores that and he goes on about his own personal agenda.
[02:47:48.919 --> 02:48:01.303]  Well, all I know is, why do I have to pay taxes and have my genitals groped and everything, but all these foreigners, they admit flights every day to JFK, no one's even checked, IDs aren't even looked at, that's New York Daily News.
[02:48:01.903 --> 02:48:02.664]  This is bull!
[02:48:02.984 --> 02:48:10.887]  I mean, I'm sitting there with the customs guy, narrowing his eyes, he knows full well who I am, he's interrogating me every time they pull me out of the line for extra interrogation.
[02:48:11.107 --> 02:48:16.528]  Sometimes they take me behind closed doors, dig through my dirty underwear, literally, and just bug their eyes out at me.
[02:48:16.589 --> 02:48:17.749]  I mean, it's crazy!
[02:48:18.979 --> 02:48:19.799]  It's a power trip.
[02:48:19.819 --> 02:48:23.661]  You know, I've experienced those same things going through customs, also when you go through the TSA.
[02:48:23.701 --> 02:48:24.802]  I mean, I've had it multiple times.
[02:48:25.102 --> 02:48:30.564]  I went to TSA and some guy, he opened my Altoids can and was shaking the can around, trying to see if there's stuff in there.
[02:48:30.844 --> 02:48:32.245]  It's just, it's completely ridiculous.
[02:48:32.325 --> 02:48:39.068]  It's a complete double standard, but I guess in the sake of political correctness, they feel they can do that to the American citizen, but not the non-citizen.
[02:48:39.691 --> 02:48:40.272]  Absolutely.
[02:48:40.652 --> 02:48:42.174]  You heard the angles I want to get covered.
[02:48:42.334 --> 02:48:43.895]  And, you know, obviously there's the big angle.
[02:48:43.915 --> 02:48:47.719]  The media finally covers that Obama and the War Patrol are shipping the illegals in.
[02:48:47.739 --> 02:48:50.402]  I mean, what other angles are you going to hit, Jakari?
[02:48:51.445 --> 02:48:56.947]  Well, we're going to go out here and do a man on the street, and since we're so close to the border, one of the things we want to ask people is, how do you feel about the wall?
[02:48:57.187 --> 02:49:04.169]  Because we've seen the reports, I believe it was on MSNBC, where they went out and asked a similar question, and they were surprised that many people said they wanted it.
[02:49:04.509 --> 02:49:12.951]  So we're going to just ask the people who actually live here, not, you know, some talking head up in New York, what they think of the wall, if they think it's a good thing, if it's a bad thing, what they think about the situation in general.
[02:49:13.863 --> 02:49:22.028]  Sure, and when MSNBC did that, the guy spent two months actually at the border towns, the farmers, the ranchers, who were mainly Hispanic, where they're getting hit by the crime.
[02:49:22.048 --> 02:49:26.571]  I think a lot of folks who are going to file in the city are probably there illegal, so they might be supporting it, but that's my point.
[02:49:27.031 --> 02:49:28.332]  We don't even need a wall.
[02:49:28.953 --> 02:49:36.397]  We just need to go after employers that hire people illegally, flagrantly, and we need to just not ship people in and advertise all this free welfare.
[02:49:36.618 --> 02:49:37.038]  Game over.
[02:49:39.005 --> 02:49:39.786]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[02:49:41.068 --> 02:49:47.396]  I don't think the wall is the best of ideas, but if we enforce the laws that are already on the books, I think we could cut down on the problem a great deal.
[02:49:47.915 --> 02:49:51.758]  Well, I agree with Ron Paul when he said like five years ago they were talking about a wall and you'll never finish it.
[02:49:51.778 --> 02:49:53.659]  He said, look, the wall's going to keep us in.
[02:49:53.699 --> 02:49:54.360]  That's true.
[02:49:55.241 --> 02:49:56.722]  They harass us, the citizens.
[02:49:57.342 --> 02:49:58.523]  I'm not even blaming the Border Patrol people.
[02:49:58.543 --> 02:50:00.104]  That's what they're ordered to do, the customs people.
[02:50:00.144 --> 02:50:01.005]  But still, it's happening.
[02:50:02.206 --> 02:50:07.670]  So no, look, the IRS wants a law where you can't even fly, period, if they claim they're investigating you.
[02:50:08.070 --> 02:50:10.372]  Now you can't leave the country if they've got an investigation open.
[02:50:11.613 --> 02:50:13.594]  They're trying to make it hard for us to get out of the country.
[02:50:13.834 --> 02:50:16.334]  So I just say, you know what, I disagree with Trump on the wall.
[02:50:16.634 --> 02:50:22.276]  It's a fun thing to talk about and all this, but all I want Trump to do is just not let, you know, the illegals get free welfare.
[02:50:22.616 --> 02:50:23.276]  That'll fix it right there.
[02:50:24.636 --> 02:50:32.338]  And as you talk about this travel, I think if they want to take people's passports and deny them travel because they're under investigation, Mr. Clinton's under investigation.
[02:50:32.398 --> 02:50:34.939]  Why doesn't somebody say something about that and seize their assets?
[02:50:35.512 --> 02:50:36.613]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[02:50:36.833 --> 02:50:37.294]  Absolutely.
[02:50:37.314 --> 02:50:43.520]  We're not even talking about a criminal investigation with a grand jury or something, folks, or, you know, where you've been indicted and they say don't leave the county.
[02:50:43.880 --> 02:50:46.022]  We're talking about anybody when they just open an investigation.
[02:50:46.443 --> 02:50:49.005]  That's probably happened to me six, seven times in my life.
[02:50:49.325 --> 02:50:52.368]  Everybody else you know has had the IRS send them letters and open an investigation.
[02:50:52.729 --> 02:50:53.069]  Boom!
[02:50:53.269 --> 02:50:54.070]  Can't leave the U.S.
[02:50:54.090 --> 02:50:55.331]  when they got the investigation open.
[02:50:55.972 --> 02:50:57.453]  And, I mean, that is incredible.
[02:50:57.473 --> 02:50:59.876]  We'll come back with Jakari, Anadon Salazar, then David Knight.
[02:51:10.049 --> 02:51:13.810]  What was it that the Attorney General said back when he was Deputy Attorney General?
[02:51:14.711 --> 02:51:15.251]  Eric Holder.
[02:51:15.291 --> 02:51:19.092]  He said we need to literally brainwash the American people against guns.
[02:51:19.712 --> 02:51:25.474]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[02:51:25.514 --> 02:51:30.156]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[02:51:30.196 --> 02:51:37.058]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[02:51:37.378 --> 02:51:46.060]  Well, that's exactly what they've at least been able to do to a certain segment of zombie-like creatures pretending they're human.
[02:51:46.240 --> 02:51:53.702]  They have convinced them that they have no right to defend themselves, and that they themselves aren't even able to stand up for their families.
[02:51:54.382 --> 02:52:03.484]  That is the true definition of slavery, where people are so disempowered, they can't even imagine that they themselves could put up any type of resistance.
[02:52:04.264 --> 02:52:12.387]  And if you won't put up a resistance to a physical attack, you won't put up resistance to the private Federal Reserve signing you onto trillions of debt that you don't owe.
[02:52:12.927 --> 02:52:18.670]  You won't put up a resistance to medical mafias that want to force GMO foods on your children and dangerous vaccines.
[02:52:19.170 --> 02:52:29.334]  You won't put up a resistance when Sharia law starts coming into the United States and they're cancelling political rallies that mildly criticize Islam and its attacks on homosexuals.
[02:52:30.394 --> 02:52:32.455]  My friends, it's time to grow a spine.
[02:52:33.236 --> 02:52:38.939]  As Thomas Jefferson famously said, a nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves.
[02:52:39.479 --> 02:52:48.084]  And Rolling Stone and many other publications have come out and thrown down their stinking gauntlet, their hypocritical gauntlet, and said it's time to repeal the Second Amendment.
[02:52:48.325 --> 02:52:50.706]  They admit they want to ban guns.
[02:52:50.766 --> 02:52:53.568]  They admit they want you disarmed like New York or Chicago.
[02:52:53.808 --> 02:52:57.270]  The political class wants to dominate what they see as their property.
[02:52:58.050 --> 02:52:59.051]  Are you their property?
[02:52:59.691 --> 02:53:02.813]  Will you sit there and let their jihadis mow you and your family down?
[02:53:03.293 --> 02:53:07.056]  Or will you stand up and become self-sufficient and start defending your family?
[02:53:07.556 --> 02:53:08.697]  Really, the choice is up to you.
[02:53:08.817 --> 02:53:19.084]  The American birthright started over the attempt to confiscate our guns in Lexington and Concord in 1775, leading to July 4, 1776, and our Declaration of Independence.
[02:53:19.524 --> 02:53:21.806]  You've got to decide whether you want that birthright,
[02:53:22.626 --> 02:53:24.448]  Or if you want the birthright of slaves.
[02:53:25.249 --> 02:53:26.570]  If you want to be slaves, that's great.
[02:53:26.911 --> 02:53:29.994]  May your chains set lightly upon you, to quote Patrick Henry.
[02:53:30.574 --> 02:53:32.797]  But as for me, give me liberty.
[02:53:33.537 --> 02:53:34.558]  Or give me death.
[02:53:35.199 --> 02:53:37.622]  The great battle for the Second Amendment is happening now.
[02:53:38.222 --> 02:53:39.804]  The first phase is an info war.
[02:53:40.264 --> 02:53:41.506]  And I suggest all of you
[02:53:42.006 --> 02:53:45.110]  Understand, the big assault is happening as we speak.
[02:53:45.711 --> 02:53:51.759]  The greatest attack on our freedoms that we've ever witnessed, not just the Second Amendment, is happening today.
[02:53:52.440 --> 02:53:54.824]  All good men and women must come to the aid of their country.
[02:53:55.224 --> 02:53:58.088]  And that fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[02:54:05.802 --> 02:54:10.125]  I'm going to do five minutes in the next hour, cover some of the news I haven't hit yet, and then David Knight's taking over.
[02:54:10.165 --> 02:54:14.567]  He's going to be getting into Trump versus GOP, the abortion ruling of the Supreme Court.
[02:54:14.627 --> 02:54:23.232]  Obama's going to follow that one, but not the one about, hey, you can't bring in people and advertise everything's free and then have the Border Patrol be a delivery force for the illegals.
[02:54:24.153 --> 02:54:25.094]  I mean, it's just not fair.
[02:54:25.134 --> 02:54:26.394]  No other country acts like this.
[02:54:26.434 --> 02:54:27.295]  It's so crazy.
[02:54:28.095 --> 02:54:29.416]  Fine, let the illegals in.
[02:54:29.676 --> 02:54:30.697]  Give me free stuff, too.
[02:54:30.737 --> 02:54:31.878]  Just don't grab my genitals.
[02:54:33.066 --> 02:54:34.627]  That's what makes me so mad about this.
[02:54:34.727 --> 02:54:39.910]  It's just, it's so obvious they're bringing in voters and unskilled laborers to break the economy.
[02:54:40.730 --> 02:54:42.151]  That's a model the globalists have.
[02:54:43.131 --> 02:54:51.476]  Briefly, before I go back and get some final comments from Jakari Jackson, we're sold out of the Hillary Clinton prison shirts.
[02:54:52.176 --> 02:54:53.397]  That was edition number two.
[02:54:53.457 --> 02:54:54.617]  Edition three is coming out.
[02:54:54.798 --> 02:54:58.920]  It's the same, except it has Infowars.com on the shoulder, not just on the back.
[02:54:59.673 --> 02:55:01.216]  And then Hillary for President in 2016.
[02:55:02.377 --> 02:55:03.539]  But that has sold out.
[02:55:03.559 --> 02:55:05.062]  I think there's like a few left in small.
[02:55:05.082 --> 02:55:08.167]  Because you get 75% off on it when you sign up for the newsletter.
[02:55:08.187 --> 02:55:09.909]  50% off when you just buy one.
[02:55:11.075 --> 02:55:17.898]  That special is ending in the next few hours, and it really is causing a national meme all over TV.
[02:55:17.918 --> 02:55:18.699]  People are wearing it.
[02:55:18.799 --> 02:55:21.660]  The top Google search last week was, is Hillary Clinton going to prison?
[02:55:22.200 --> 02:55:24.261]  This is just an example of the power of the people.
[02:55:24.802 --> 02:55:30.865]  And wearing a Moulin Lambe or an InfoWars shirt from InfoWarsStore.com, not just Hillary for prison, you will meet like-minded people.
[02:55:31.165 --> 02:55:32.986]  You will find out how many patriots there are.
[02:55:33.486 --> 02:55:34.947]  You will run to these around your town or city.
[02:55:35.347 --> 02:55:39.549]  You'll meet enough folks in a few months walking around the streets to form a huge organization politically.
[02:55:40.149 --> 02:55:45.815]  Also, a deep cleanse is an amazing system of key herbs and other compounds that detoxify the body.
[02:55:47.014 --> 02:55:50.816]  It's 20% off until Wednesday, and your purchase helps fund this operation.
[02:55:50.836 --> 02:55:51.977]  It really is an amazing product.
[02:55:51.997 --> 02:55:53.858]  Just take a drop or full out of the tongue every day.
[02:55:53.898 --> 02:56:05.264]  It works in synergy with the X2, the other great products, like DNA Force at InfoWarsLife.com, or InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site, or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[02:56:05.364 --> 02:56:08.865]  An internal FEMA report being reported on by Vice.
[02:56:09.346 --> 02:56:09.966]  It's on drudge.
[02:56:10.386 --> 02:56:12.868]  It says 300 plus percent food increases in the next few years.
[02:56:13.448 --> 02:56:14.869]  That's what the government thinks is going to happen.
[02:56:15.869 --> 02:56:22.791]  All I know is you need to get storable foods, and the best place to get them is mfulworthstore.com, mfulworthselect, 15% off, we're running that for one week only.
[02:56:23.691 --> 02:56:26.312]  It's not 30% off, but it's already a super low price, folks.
[02:56:26.532 --> 02:56:30.993]  We can't always offer 30% off, but 15% is the best I can do, and we already have the lowest price out there.
[02:56:31.493 --> 02:56:33.974]  Okay, Jakari, other points that I haven't raised.
[02:56:34.334 --> 02:56:37.015]  What else is on your radar, my friend, in this bizarro world?
[02:56:38.643 --> 02:56:42.346]  Well, it's a very strange time, Alex, just as you were talking about many of the things there.
[02:56:42.386 --> 02:56:47.029]  The Hillary for Prison t-shirts, as you said, it's a great way to meet like-minded people.
[02:56:47.069 --> 02:56:49.892]  Every time we go out to the rallies, we see a lot of these just around town.
[02:56:49.972 --> 02:56:52.394]  I see people wearing the Hillary for Prison t-shirts.
[02:56:52.414 --> 02:56:55.896]  I haven't seen too many around here, but you can understand why that is.
[02:56:56.337 --> 02:57:03.082]  But as we continue to do the reports out here, we're going to have some reports coming in where we have people flying the drone.
[02:57:03.662 --> 02:57:14.912]  Around the border trying to get various footage out there, and we have many more things that we hope to get lined up a couple interviews We're looking into so hopefully we'll have all those reports in the next day or so well incredible job I mean every time you guys go down there.
[02:57:14.932 --> 02:57:21.857]  You just absolutely national news I mean you guys caught with bigs all the drugs being brought in And you know all the rest of it.
[02:57:21.917 --> 02:57:27.242]  It's just crazy that our media could be doing this, but they won't do it It's not that I mean we are good.
[02:57:27.302 --> 02:57:28.963]  We work hard our crew is wonderful.
[02:57:29.323 --> 02:57:31.725]  It's not that I'm even that good It's that they won't do their job
[02:57:32.526 --> 02:57:35.249]  I mean, how many news items a week do we break nationally?
[02:57:35.810 --> 02:57:37.072]  It's like every day, Jakari.
[02:57:37.112 --> 02:57:39.174]  Yeah, it's a lot.
[02:57:40.155 --> 02:57:41.116]  Watson's way up there.
[02:57:41.276 --> 02:57:44.140]  Many of the other guys do pretty well putting that stuff out in the news cycle.
[02:57:44.704 --> 02:57:45.945]  Well, you're doing a great job, too.
[02:57:46.005 --> 02:57:48.548]  And again, it's not about just, oh, you're great, I'm great.
[02:57:48.568 --> 02:57:52.453]  But I just want to talk about the great crew, the great guests we have, and the fact that we're having an effect.
[02:57:52.813 --> 02:58:01.843]  And I want the listeners to know, supporting the broadcast, spreading the word, signing up for the free newsletter, buying the products, all of it is really having a big effect, supporting our local stations, Jakari.
[02:58:01.883 --> 02:58:06.088]  I mean, it's amazing to see how we're really changing the narrative back towards reality.
[02:58:07.318 --> 02:58:08.659]  Yeah, it is a big effect.
[02:58:08.679 --> 02:58:14.865]  You know, just like everything we do, whether people, they parrot it, or they do some kind of hit piece off of it, or whatever else, it's definitely out there in the consciousness.
[02:58:15.833 --> 02:58:18.335]  And this is the mainstream media with a 6% trust rate.
[02:58:18.415 --> 02:58:20.917]  When they attack us, it's like a badge of courage.
[02:58:20.957 --> 02:58:23.299]  It's like having a child molester salon.
[02:58:23.319 --> 02:58:27.142]  You know, the child molester site that's constantly writing articles about child molesting is great.
[02:58:27.963 --> 02:58:30.304]  And everything, or how great child molesters are attacking us.
[02:58:30.365 --> 02:58:30.905]  I mean, great!
[02:58:31.245 --> 02:58:36.529]  A site that promotes child molestation and guys liking five-year-old girls hates us, thank God.
[02:58:36.809 --> 02:58:38.291]  Jakari Jackson, great job, my friend.
[02:58:39.552 --> 02:58:42.074]  We'll be back with David Knight and more, but I'm doing five more minutes.
[02:58:42.655 --> 02:58:44.216]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:44.557 --> 02:58:45.438]  Spread that link, folks.
[02:58:46.098 --> 02:58:46.939]  Support our local stations.
[02:59:02.805 --> 02:59:06.309]  During Special Forces selection, it's not like you could ever take the easy road.
[02:59:06.329 --> 02:59:10.514]  You know, you can't take stairways to make, you know, being a Special Forces operator easy.
[02:59:10.855 --> 02:59:16.061]  I'm always looking for the best and natural way to get myself to the
[02:59:16.784 --> 02:59:20.947]  It's the idea of getting in there and doing real hard work.
[02:59:21.487 --> 02:59:23.068]  It's changing who you are.
[02:59:23.689 --> 02:59:28.812]  Becoming better, stronger, faster, and ultimately, harder to kill.
[02:59:29.973 --> 02:59:31.974]  I have to have the edge over my opponents.
[02:59:32.575 --> 02:59:37.358]  I believe that InfoWars products, Superman Vitality, you know, that gives me the edge.
[02:59:37.478 --> 02:59:41.801]  I've been taking it, and I'm still getting faster and stronger every day.
[02:59:43.519 --> 02:59:56.418]  Start your journey to super male vitality today at InfoWarsLife.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:12.825 --> 03:00:14.986]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:15.446 --> 03:00:20.688]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:22.649 --> 03:00:26.050]  Look, I'm not complaining, but I am just exhausted.
[03:00:28.291 --> 03:00:37.715]  And by exhausted, to watch them roll out total open borders lawlessness, the UN running it.
[03:00:39.983 --> 03:00:52.695]  And every other law being ignored by a group of criminals that are looting the entire nation, and they're openly pushing, arresting people that disagree with the government, in the Democratic Party platform, I am entering the Twilight Zone.
[03:00:52.735 --> 03:00:54.837]  I mean, I knew this was all coming.
[03:00:55.958 --> 03:00:59.261]  But it is something else to actually see it unfold.
[03:00:59.701 --> 03:01:00.422]  Look at this article.
[03:01:00.442 --> 03:01:02.944]  I didn't even get to this today, but Paul Watson, InfoWars.com.
[03:01:04.244 --> 03:01:09.007]  And there's like articles on Drudge with Muslim women freaking out and attacking gay people.
[03:01:10.568 --> 03:01:17.613]  It's like, dude, in their own countries they will stone you to death if a woman is seen walking around without her head covered.
[03:01:19.414 --> 03:01:24.278]  I mean, I don't want to sign up to something beyond Jim Jones and Heaven's Gate all rolled into one.
[03:01:24.318 --> 03:01:25.719]  I don't like cults, man!
[03:01:25.739 --> 03:01:32.003]  I got a bunch of weird people calling themselves liberals saying I'm closed-minded and Islamophobic.
[03:01:33.757 --> 03:01:36.960]  A phobia is being scared of something that isn't scary.
[03:01:38.922 --> 03:01:42.005]  I'm somebody that'll swim in the ocean at night.
[03:01:45.008 --> 03:01:49.011]  Other people don't go to the Texas coast and swim out 200 yards on their moon.
[03:01:49.672 --> 03:01:51.474]  I do it, because I enjoy it.
[03:01:53.155 --> 03:01:57.900]  I mean, I was fearless when I was like 11, 12 years old, just go out swimming at night.
[03:01:59.565 --> 03:02:25.554]  I'm not saying I'm Mr. Courage here, but I love the people calling me a coward because, no, they're bringing in people that are so dysfunctional, their countries have fallen apart, and so-called liberals are bringing it in, worshipping Hillary, who she claims loves gay people, and she gets more money from folks that kill people like that than you can ever imagine.
[03:02:25.594 --> 03:02:27.295]  I'm just sick of what frauds you are.
[03:02:28.962 --> 03:02:30.263]  Cultural enrichment.
[03:02:30.343 --> 03:02:32.325]  Muslim smashes up Swedish church.
[03:02:32.405 --> 03:02:35.168]  Italian saint defaced with Allah Akbar.
[03:02:35.849 --> 03:02:36.449]  Graffiti.
[03:02:37.270 --> 03:02:39.752]  European multiculturalism continues to work wonders.
[03:02:40.753 --> 03:02:44.777]  And I mean, we see these stories every hour now.
[03:02:48.197 --> 03:02:56.939]  I was at the mall and saw women in full hijabs and burqas by themselves in groups and then saw their men around other corners and actually had them going.
[03:02:57.679 --> 03:03:01.960]  And I mean, I know there's other Muslim waves that aren't bad people, fleeing the radicals and all that.
[03:03:02.720 --> 03:03:09.021]  The point is, is they're bringing in folks from the worst places that run around killing their fellow Muslims.
[03:03:09.701 --> 03:03:14.022]  And the Pope is running around shooting his mouth off and I'm just personally sick of it.
[03:03:15.353 --> 03:03:15.893]  But look at this.
[03:03:16.994 --> 03:03:18.734]  Kit Daniels came in and pointed this out.
[03:03:20.715 --> 03:03:28.918]  In 2014, he wrote, Border Patrol agents, this is from them, UN taking control of America's southern border.
[03:03:29.619 --> 03:03:37.722]  Under the pretense of labeling illegals refugees, UN personnel working with DHS to ship MS-13 gang members in the US, says agent.
[03:03:38.638 --> 03:03:53.703]  And now, two years later, after we break all this and show them admitting it, and show the buses shipping them in, ABC News, UN, more Central Americans headed to US, and the newscast admits they're illegal, but they're legalized instantly by a magic fiat.
[03:03:54.303 --> 03:03:57.184]  There's not even border agents there, they just put them at the bus stop.
[03:03:58.004 --> 03:03:58.484]  With money.
[03:03:59.464 --> 03:04:02.765]  And now they're, these new waves are almost all men.
[03:04:03.806 --> 03:04:04.446]  Watch the video.
[03:04:06.306 --> 03:04:08.187]  I mean, it is just crazy!
[03:04:10.188 --> 03:04:14.850]  And man, I was sitting there with that customs agent Saturday.
[03:04:15.971 --> 03:04:17.792]  Looked me up and down, asked me all these questions.
[03:04:17.832 --> 03:04:19.873]  I kept answering him, he kept asking me questions again.
[03:04:20.853 --> 03:04:23.675]  Called my kids over, called my parents over, and asked them all questions.
[03:04:24.735 --> 03:04:27.997]  And just sat there looking at us, not hatefully, but just real serious.
[03:04:29.037 --> 03:04:31.198]  Gotta check you, because we know full well who you are.
[03:04:31.238 --> 03:04:33.019]  We gotta check you, because you have no criminal record.
[03:04:33.599 --> 03:04:35.340]  We gotta check you real close, buddy.
[03:04:35.961 --> 03:04:38.682]  Because you're a big fat milk cow that pays this government a lot of taxes.
[03:04:40.026 --> 03:04:40.826]  It's good to be a slave!
[03:04:41.527 --> 03:04:42.848]  The land of the free, home of the cowards.
[03:04:43.888 --> 03:04:44.709]  I tell you, it's sickening.
[03:04:45.009 --> 03:04:48.070]  InfoWars.com, though, is reaching people more than ever.
[03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:50.132]  We're under attack because we're having an effect.

[03:07:52.973 --> 03:07:57.120]  Like the Sultan of Brunei, who maintains a harem of underage girls.
[03:07:57.681 --> 03:07:59.163]  The Clintons' War on Women.
[03:07:59.624 --> 03:08:00.725]  In stores now.
[03:08:10.885 --> 03:08:11.826]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.286 --> 03:08:13.366]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.007 --> 03:08:15.847]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:15.948 --> 03:08:21.230]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:21.350 --> 03:08:26.292]  On this Monday, June 27, 2016, we have a major Supreme Court decision.
[03:08:26.313 --> 03:08:28.774]  I want to tell you a little bit about what's behind that.
[03:08:28.854 --> 03:08:34.837]  We also have another example of Obama's monumental theft and fraud.
[03:08:35.802 --> 03:08:37.703]  And this is happening all across the country.
[03:08:37.723 --> 03:08:51.591]  We've done a report, I did one with Rob Jacobson, about the millions upon millions of acres that Obama is stealing, and yet today he's come out with a new monument.
[03:08:51.651 --> 03:08:56.574]  He's made a monument of Stonewall Inn in New York City.
[03:08:57.114 --> 03:09:04.699]  This is an LGBT monument, and I have to look at this and wonder, is Obama going to take all of New York City as part of this monument?
[03:09:05.353 --> 03:09:09.656]  Because you see, that would be the parallel to what he's doing across the country.
[03:09:10.196 --> 03:09:11.237]  So we'll talk about that a little bit.
[03:09:11.257 --> 03:09:20.344]  We're also going to talk about some Trump news, as well as the whiny millennials and Brexit, and what's really behind that.
[03:09:20.384 --> 03:09:22.205]  Let's talk about the Supreme Court decision first.
[03:09:23.166 --> 03:09:25.768]  This is the report on it from the Wall Street Journal.
[03:09:25.988 --> 03:09:30.211]  The headline says, Supreme Court rejects the Texas abortion law as an undue burden.
[03:09:31.092 --> 03:09:31.652]  An undue burden.
[03:09:31.952 --> 03:09:37.135]  Now understand, this was a 5-3 vote, so it would not have made any difference if Scalia had been around.
[03:09:37.155 --> 03:09:38.916]  It would have been a 5-4 vote.
[03:09:39.856 --> 03:09:45.799]  This was made possible because we had Anthony Kennedy, who many people thought, well, it's going to be a 4-4 split.
[03:09:46.259 --> 03:09:49.460]  It will go back to a lower court, which has already thrown out this charge.
[03:09:49.480 --> 03:09:50.821]  They've already lost at the lower level.
[03:09:51.261 --> 03:09:53.082]  So the law will stand.
[03:09:53.302 --> 03:09:55.303]  The Texas law will stand.
[03:09:56.448 --> 03:09:57.469]  But that didn't happen.
[03:09:57.929 --> 03:10:06.254]  Instead, we had a justice that was appointed by Ronald Reagan joining two justices from Clinton and two justices from Obama.
[03:10:06.974 --> 03:10:07.715]  See how that works?
[03:10:08.375 --> 03:10:16.840]  See, it's not a very good strategy, is it, to try to make sure the Constitution is going to be saved by appointing judges.
[03:10:17.281 --> 03:10:19.202]  Yes, a good idea to try to do that.
[03:10:19.282 --> 03:10:23.504]  We should try to appoint judges who will rule according to law.
[03:10:24.645 --> 03:10:30.007]  But understand that there's a lot of judges there already, and of course it's going to get worse if Hillary Clinton wins.
[03:10:30.027 --> 03:10:38.350]  She's going to appoint the types of judges that ruled here that said, we don't care what the law says, we don't care what the legal procedure is, we like abortion and that's it.
[03:10:38.370 --> 03:10:42.992]  And if you think that's a stupid characterization of this, an oversimplification of it, it's not.
[03:10:44.492 --> 03:10:47.774]  The first thing that this dissent from Alito
[03:10:49.212 --> 03:10:49.713]  Talks about.
[03:10:49.793 --> 03:10:51.235]  And let's go back to the law first.
[03:10:51.315 --> 03:10:52.437]  Okay, this is something going back to 2013.
[03:10:52.477 --> 03:10:54.280]  This is a Texas law.
[03:10:54.300 --> 03:10:55.983]  It was signed in by Rick Perry.
[03:10:56.383 --> 03:11:02.513]  And what it did was it required abortion clinics to have the same standards that ambulatory surgical centers would have.
[03:11:03.359 --> 03:11:06.260]  That they would have physicians there who were really physicians.
[03:11:06.300 --> 03:11:09.401]  They were admitted to hospital privileges within 30 miles.
[03:11:09.421 --> 03:11:15.903]  They also enacted a lot of other safety regulations that previously had not been enacted against abortion clinics.
[03:11:16.623 --> 03:11:24.525]  Things like smoke detectors and making sure that you can get a gurney through the aisles of the little house.
[03:11:24.565 --> 03:11:27.726]  And in many cases, these were not purpose-built clinics.
[03:11:28.717 --> 03:11:34.060]  Many of these were just simply homes that had been repurposed as an abortion clinic.
[03:11:34.540 --> 03:11:35.340]  Residential homes.
[03:11:35.901 --> 03:11:42.784]  And so there were impediments in terms of being able to get somebody out of there in case an emergency procedure had occurred.
[03:11:43.324 --> 03:11:44.665]  Wouldn't you think those would be reasonable?
[03:11:45.485 --> 03:11:52.108]  Wouldn't you think that if this really was about women's health, as we're being told, that they would want to have these kinds of safeguards in there?
[03:11:52.749 --> 03:11:55.030]  You see, it brilliantly called the bluff
[03:11:56.127 --> 03:12:02.375]  Of these people who simply want to murder babies as part of a eugenics agenda.
[03:12:02.435 --> 03:12:04.016]  And we've exposed that over and over again.
[03:12:04.037 --> 03:12:05.498]  That's how this started with Margaret Sanger.
[03:12:05.518 --> 03:12:06.940]  That's how it started with Planned Parenthood.
[03:12:07.220 --> 03:12:12.126]  You can go back and you can see the writings of the Democrats and the Republicans.
[03:12:13.027 --> 03:12:21.253]  All the generations of the George Bush family, going back to Prescott Bush, and then going through George H.W.
[03:12:21.353 --> 03:12:23.675]  as well as just recently in the debates.
[03:12:24.195 --> 03:12:26.857]  Remember when Jeb was talking about how, well, we stopped the funding.
[03:12:27.258 --> 03:12:29.239]  We had about a half million or whatever the number was.
[03:12:29.259 --> 03:12:29.900]  I can't remember.
[03:12:29.920 --> 03:12:40.948]  It was essentially 30 times the amount of money he donated with his private organization to Planned Parenthood, but publicly what he did was he stopped a little bit of funding from the state of Florida.
[03:12:41.854 --> 03:12:43.015]  That's the way the Bushes have been.
[03:12:43.055 --> 03:12:49.742]  Of course, his grandfather was the first treasurer of Planned Parenthood, along with Margaret Singer.
[03:12:49.762 --> 03:12:51.083]  We've shown you the letters.
[03:12:51.103 --> 03:12:54.506]  We've shown you the letters from George H.W.
[03:12:54.526 --> 03:12:56.168]  Bush, and so forth and so on.
[03:12:56.228 --> 03:13:06.158]  So, we've had a long history of the elites in both the Republican and Democrat Party who are interested, quite frankly, in eugenics.
[03:13:07.828 --> 03:13:09.490]  And they're not interested in women's health.
[03:13:09.550 --> 03:13:14.996]  And this is similar to the situation that we had when we had the EPA under Lisa Jackson.
[03:13:15.096 --> 03:13:16.157]  We talked about this many times.
[03:13:16.177 --> 03:13:17.798]  It was the first story I covered when I got here.
[03:13:18.837 --> 03:13:26.064]  They were hooking people up to tailpipes of diesel motors, okay, putting them in a room at the University of North Carolina.
[03:13:26.085 --> 03:13:28.907]  And of course, University of North Carolina, I got a little bit of news on them as well here.
[03:13:29.488 --> 03:13:37.837]  A new story about them, Christmas vacations now, microaggression, along with terms like boyfriend and girlfriend, and I love your shoes, things like that, okay.
[03:13:38.763 --> 03:13:41.364]  UNC in Chapel Hill is a loony bin.
[03:13:41.424 --> 03:13:42.565]  I used to live close to there.
[03:13:43.185 --> 03:13:45.426]  And I can tell you that it is over the top.
[03:13:45.486 --> 03:13:48.547]  It's like a university in California or something.
[03:13:48.567 --> 03:13:57.151]  But anyway, at UNC, along with the EPA, they were hooking people up to diesel tailpipes.
[03:13:57.792 --> 03:14:05.135]  They had asked for volunteers who had respiratory issues, who had heart issues, because they wanted people to have problems.
[03:14:06.192 --> 03:14:06.553]  And they did.
[03:14:06.573 --> 03:14:08.736]  They found some people who did have some problems.
[03:14:08.756 --> 03:14:18.190]  And we had a spot-on researcher who was working, Steve Malloy, who was working on this and noticed it and expanded it.
[03:14:18.230 --> 03:14:19.391]  We tried to get that stopped.
[03:14:20.213 --> 03:14:20.973]  But here's the point.
[03:14:21.333 --> 03:14:25.654]  We'd had Lisa Jackson go before Congress and say, I'm not talking about people getting sick.
[03:14:26.375 --> 03:14:28.515]  I'm talking about people dying from this.
[03:14:29.255 --> 03:14:36.497]  And so we have to do more to squash diesel engines and to enact more regulations from the EPA.
[03:14:36.517 --> 03:14:37.497]  She actually said that.
[03:14:37.537 --> 03:14:39.538]  It was a dog and pony show that was
[03:14:40.598 --> 03:14:45.881]  orchestrated and scripted by Markey out of Massachusetts.
[03:14:45.921 --> 03:14:47.162]  He was a congressman at the time.
[03:14:47.222 --> 03:14:49.223]  Now he's moved up because he does stuff like that.
[03:14:49.784 --> 03:14:50.504]  He's now a senator.
[03:14:51.084 --> 03:14:56.608]  So they scripted this thing and said, no, we're talking about it killing people.
[03:14:56.748 --> 03:15:02.331]  And then they go out and they expose these people to 72 times the level that they said was already fatal.
[03:15:02.971 --> 03:15:03.572]  So we said, wait,
[03:15:04.355 --> 03:15:10.757]  Is this a war crime situation, or are you just lying to people when you said it was going to kill people?
[03:15:10.817 --> 03:15:15.958]  So, when you look at these laws, with the Texas abortion law, they say, oh, we just are here for women's health.
[03:15:16.778 --> 03:15:17.438]  We say, oh really?
[03:15:17.758 --> 03:15:20.559]  Well, then let's make sure that these are safe procedures.
[03:15:20.619 --> 03:15:22.940]  So they call their bluff, and they put out this law there.
[03:15:23.700 --> 03:15:24.860]  And it was struck down.
[03:15:25.440 --> 03:15:29.621]  Again, Justice Kennedy, a Reagan justice, switched sides.
[03:15:29.641 --> 03:15:32.062]  And as Wall Street Journal points out, Justice Alito
[03:15:32.802 --> 03:15:38.246]  Who wrote the main dissent rocked back and forth in his chair as Justice Breyer spoke.
[03:15:38.326 --> 03:15:42.028]  He was very upset about this, frowning in apparent disagreement.
[03:15:42.448 --> 03:15:49.933]  For the second time in a week, Justice Alito summarized his dissent from the bench, a signal of his intense disagreement with the majority.
[03:15:50.874 --> 03:16:02.442]  Speaking for about 10 minutes, Justice Alito said the majority had thrown aside standard legal procedures to strike down the Texas law, ignoring rules that should have precluded the court from considering the appeal altogether.
[03:16:03.510 --> 03:16:04.851]  Now, what was the deal with it?
[03:16:04.891 --> 03:16:08.432]  Well, you know, interestingly enough, we see all this stuff out of Brexit.
[03:16:09.053 --> 03:16:10.373]  People saying, we need a do-over.
[03:16:10.433 --> 03:16:11.754]  I'm not happy with the results.
[03:16:11.974 --> 03:16:13.235]  I want to hold another election.
[03:16:13.275 --> 03:16:14.015]  I don't like that.
[03:16:14.876 --> 03:16:15.156]  Okay?
[03:16:15.876 --> 03:16:17.097]  That's essentially what this was.
[03:16:18.072 --> 03:16:18.412]  This is
[03:16:36.522 --> 03:16:42.465]  Then naked judicial activism, and that's why Justice Alito was rocking back and forth in his seat.
[03:16:42.685 --> 03:16:44.086]  He could barely contain himself.
[03:16:44.126 --> 03:16:47.047]  He could hardly sit there and listen to this nonsense.
[03:16:47.547 --> 03:16:53.190]  And then he wrote this opinion, and I pulled up his opinion, and I want to read you part of it, because these opinions are very long.
[03:16:53.230 --> 03:16:56.072]  This is like 150 pages of stuff to sort through.
[03:16:56.392 --> 03:16:58.213]  This is what he has to say at the beginning of his opinion.
[03:16:58.533 --> 03:17:00.514]  He says, the constitutionality of laws, regulation
[03:17:00.914 --> 03:17:09.420]  Regulating abortion is one of the most controversial issues in American law, but this case does not require us to delve into that contentious dispute.
[03:17:09.640 --> 03:17:10.160]  You understand?
[03:17:10.580 --> 03:17:18.846]  He said, okay, regardless of what you think about the issue, there are legal principles here that would keep us from being involved in this.
[03:17:18.886 --> 03:17:26.010]  He said, instead, the issue here concerns a workaday question that can arise in any case, no matter the subject.
[03:17:26.130 --> 03:17:26.471]  Namely,
[03:17:27.031 --> 03:17:30.776]  Whether the present case is barred by res judica, okay?
[03:17:32.459 --> 03:17:35.423]  And so what he talks about with that is he's essentially saying, hey look,
[03:17:36.584 --> 03:17:39.727]  To put that in layman's terms, okay, because I'm not a lawyer.
[03:17:40.027 --> 03:17:41.649]  But he explains it in his opinion.
[03:17:41.749 --> 03:17:44.411]  He says it's basically claim preclusion.
[03:17:44.471 --> 03:17:47.314]  It's a bedrock principle, he writes later on in his decision.
[03:17:47.574 --> 03:17:52.378]  He says, if you lose on an issue, you don't get a do-over.
[03:17:52.879 --> 03:17:53.840]  You don't get a do-over.
[03:17:54.100 --> 03:17:56.182]  Just like you don't get a do-over with Brexit.
[03:17:56.682 --> 03:17:57.723]  And he goes on to say here.
[03:17:57.743 --> 03:17:59.425]  He said, here's the worst example.
[03:18:00.085 --> 03:18:02.587]  Shortly after Texas enacted this bill,
[03:18:03.368 --> 03:18:16.434]  The petitioners in this case brought suit, claiming, among other things, that a provision of the new law requiring a physician performing an abortion to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital is facially unconstitutional, and thus totally unenforceable.
[03:18:16.954 --> 03:18:26.259]  Petitioners had a fair opportunity to make their case, but they lost on the merits in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and they chose not to petition the Supreme Court at that time.
[03:18:26.839 --> 03:18:28.159]  So the judgment became final.
[03:18:28.359 --> 03:18:28.940]  So they lost.
[03:18:29.653 --> 03:18:30.113]  They lost.
[03:18:30.693 --> 03:18:34.154]  But then they come back a few years later and say, we want to do over on that, like Brexit.
[03:18:34.594 --> 03:18:34.874]  Okay?
[03:18:35.114 --> 03:18:37.375]  This is precisely what is happening with this.
[03:18:37.635 --> 03:18:38.975]  And he goes, you don't get to do that!
[03:18:39.755 --> 03:18:41.175]  This is exactly this case.
[03:18:41.195 --> 03:18:42.856]  This isn't a similar case.
[03:18:43.396 --> 03:18:45.176]  This is exactly that case.
[03:18:45.516 --> 03:18:49.437]  You lost, you didn't appeal, you don't get to come back now and do this.
[03:18:50.117 --> 03:18:50.397]  Okay?
[03:18:50.677 --> 03:18:58.019]  Under the rules that apply in regular cases, he says, petitioners could not re-litigate the exact same claim in a second suit.
[03:18:58.099 --> 03:18:59.239]  The exact same claim.
[03:19:00.717 --> 03:19:06.679]  As we have said, a losing litigant, and he quotes the Supreme Court, and he gives you book, chapter, and verse, okay?
[03:19:07.199 --> 03:19:19.343]  Quote, a losing litigant deserves no rematch after a defeat fairly suffered in adversarial proceedings on an issue identical in substance to the one he subsequently seeks to raise.
[03:19:19.423 --> 03:19:19.903]  You get that?
[03:19:20.363 --> 03:19:20.783]  Okay?
[03:19:20.803 --> 03:19:22.384]  In other words, no do-overs, folks.
[03:19:23.308 --> 03:19:30.913]  Now, he says, however, because this is an abortion case, we throw out the law, we throw out the rules, we throw out all of our previous opinions.
[03:19:30.973 --> 03:19:40.819]  He said, this rule is now disregarded, and the court awards a victory to petitioners on the very exact claim they unsuccessfully pressed in the earlier case.
[03:19:41.579 --> 03:19:43.540]  Now when we come back, there's more.
[03:19:43.920 --> 03:19:50.925]  There's more that is ignored on this, and I want to read to you what the Supreme Court decision says, why they said they did this.
[03:19:52.017 --> 03:20:00.583]  It's absolutely amazing, and I think it underscores why we cannot trust nine political appointees to safeguard the Constitution.
[03:20:00.603 --> 03:20:01.063]  That's an idiot.
[03:20:01.644 --> 03:20:10.210]  This message is not just addressed to my fellow Americans, but addressed to people across the world of every race, color, and creed who believe in free speech.
[03:20:11.210 --> 03:20:14.311]  ...enshrined here in our Republic as the First Amendment.
[03:20:15.011 --> 03:20:18.412]  It's the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights because it is the most important.
[03:20:18.432 --> 03:20:27.374]  The right to speak, the right to publish, the right to assemble, the right to petition, the right to practice your own religion and not having a state-run or authorized system.
[03:20:27.554 --> 03:20:36.797]  We have seen Facebook, Google, Twitter, and other media platforms increasingly censor even mainline libertarian and conservative ideas.
[03:20:37.117 --> 03:20:48.669]  Ladies and gentlemen, Facebook, if it's able to successfully get away with censoring a wide spectrum of ideas that the establishment doesn't agree with, not just conservatives, will set a mega-massive precedent.
[03:20:49.190 --> 03:20:50.571]  Facebook's over a third of the internet.
[03:20:50.891 --> 03:20:51.372]  Think about that.
[03:20:51.872 --> 03:20:53.354]  Of the traffic and people visiting things.
[03:20:53.714 --> 03:20:54.335]  And then it's over.
[03:20:54.635 --> 03:20:58.939]  You think it's bad that communist China with a billion, 300 million people is censoring?
[03:20:59.760 --> 03:21:07.022]  Zuckerberg, who calls his users dumb F-ers, has been meeting with the Chinese censorship leadership, openly trying to tweak it.
[03:21:07.122 --> 03:21:12.004]  He met with Merkel, and openly in a hot mic, said, don't worry, I'm going to start suppressing and censoring people.
[03:21:12.204 --> 03:21:16.666]  They report when someone criticizes open borders to the German government, and they come and arrest you.
[03:21:16.826 --> 03:21:17.646]  This is a global
[03:21:18.166 --> 03:21:18.626]  We're good.
[03:21:35.520 --> 03:21:36.100]  Most don't want.
[03:21:36.180 --> 03:21:38.301]  This is the ultimate threat to humanity.
[03:21:38.701 --> 03:21:40.862]  This is worse than what we saw in the Soviet Union.
[03:21:41.283 --> 03:21:45.064]  This is right out of Nazi Germany or right out of Maoist China.
[03:21:45.464 --> 03:21:46.805]  So we're fighting for free speech.
[03:21:47.145 --> 03:21:57.210]  When you spread the word about Infowars.com, our videos, our stories, our reports, and when you post it on different platforms, that circumvents their AI systems that are trying to restrict the flow of information.
[03:21:57.350 --> 03:21:59.251]  We stand together or we hang separate.
[03:21:59.491 --> 03:22:04.333]  Another thing we're doing is not just battling to stop the censorship, we're also building other platforms.
[03:22:04.773 --> 03:22:12.578]  Getting on as many third-party systems as there are out there and spreading the word of basic free market liberty and human empowerment and the new renaissance.
[03:22:13.078 --> 03:22:16.340]  But also, the experts I've talked to said, Alex, you missed the boat.
[03:22:16.360 --> 03:22:19.642]  You've been a pioneer in many ways, but you haven't promoted email.
[03:22:19.722 --> 03:22:22.044]  And I said, yeah, I don't ever really market on email.
[03:22:22.144 --> 03:22:23.965]  I just, I just, it's low-tech.
[03:22:24.145 --> 03:22:24.925]  And they're like, no, no, no.
[03:22:24.985 --> 03:22:28.688]  That's what's going to be hard to censor, even if the internet kill switch comes into place.
[03:22:28.828 --> 03:22:33.151]  There are systems and there are developments that make it very hard still
[03:22:34.131 --> 03:22:39.644]  To stop email and to stop that information being sent over networks, you name it.
[03:22:39.724 --> 03:22:41.148]  So it's essential.
[03:22:42.091 --> 03:22:53.341]  That everybody go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter to get exclusive articles, videos, promo code sometimes, the shopping cart like we had a few weeks ago with Hillary for prison, 50% off.
[03:22:53.661 --> 03:22:58.485]  I mean, there are some big discounts we send to incentivize people and plus you're some of the most hardcore patriots.
[03:22:58.785 --> 03:23:03.149]  You can send the email and the newsletter on with exclusive videos and articles many days.
[03:23:03.790 --> 03:23:04.751]  So that's another great reason.
[03:23:04.771 --> 03:23:08.394]  But overall, it's so that we have direct contact
[03:23:08.914 --> 03:23:22.879]  With fellow patriots out there around the world, and if they try to start shutting our websites down and other things, which they've tried to do, and kick us off Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, you name it, we'll be able to send you direct videos that you can then send on to others.
[03:23:22.899 --> 03:23:31.463]  We've all got to start thinking about the censorship and actively fighting it, getting more active and not taking independent liberty-based media for granted, which I know you don't do.
[03:23:32.683 --> 03:23:42.825]  But really having a sense of urgency and getting the info out more while building new avenues on cutting-edge tech and cutting-edge platforms, but also old tech like email.
[03:23:43.065 --> 03:23:50.466]  So please join hundreds of thousands of others that have been signing up every few months at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:23:50.806 --> 03:23:59.908]  And you can also spread the word about our free feeds and more podcasts, droid apps, iPhone apps, it's all free at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:24:02.731 --> 03:24:07.874]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:08.555 --> 03:24:10.896]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:24:10.916 --> 03:24:16.740]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:16.800 --> 03:24:18.521]  I'm David Knight on this Monday.
[03:24:19.582 --> 03:24:21.363]  And we're looking at June 27th.
[03:24:21.383 --> 03:24:23.084]  We're looking at the Supreme Court case.
[03:24:23.605 --> 03:24:25.186]  And I wanted to give you an example.
[03:24:26.679 --> 03:24:28.260]  Just how corrupt this whole system is.
[03:24:28.300 --> 03:24:32.524]  I mean, we've got people about Brexit saying, we need a do-over.
[03:24:32.564 --> 03:24:33.505]  I don't like the results.
[03:24:34.245 --> 03:24:39.190]  We've got the Supreme Court actually giving a do-over, which is against their previous rulings.
[03:24:39.250 --> 03:24:40.832]  It's against the law to do this.
[03:24:41.432 --> 03:24:42.613]  These people already lost.
[03:24:42.813 --> 03:24:48.439]  They didn't appeal the case, but now they gave them a do-over and said, all right, and now we're going to reverse what happened earlier.
[03:24:49.199 --> 03:24:50.561]  And then, of course, in politics,
[03:24:51.141 --> 03:25:04.557]  We see over this weekend an orchestrated attempt by the never-Trumper GOP, I'm with her, Hillary people, okay, people like George Will, National Review, David French, the guy that was a candidate for about a week.
[03:25:05.017 --> 03:25:08.521]  You got this guy who's filed suit in North Carolina, in Virginia.
[03:25:09.594 --> 03:25:11.495]  They want a do-over as well.
[03:25:11.895 --> 03:25:18.559]  They want to say, hey, we are delegates and we have superior First Amendment rights to you people.
[03:25:18.959 --> 03:25:23.341]  What our opinion is, it matters more than millions of voters in these elections.
[03:25:23.421 --> 03:25:26.423]  And so we're going to say that you can't penalize me.
[03:25:26.443 --> 03:25:28.103]  We're going to sue you over this.
[03:25:28.184 --> 03:25:31.045]  So over and over again, we're seeing people say we want a do-over.
[03:25:31.385 --> 03:25:32.086]  The abortion law.
[03:25:32.146 --> 03:25:32.506]  Brexit.
[03:25:33.166 --> 03:25:34.347]  The GOP convention.
[03:25:34.747 --> 03:25:39.711]  Everybody is saying, hey, I didn't win, and so I'm going to change all the rules right now.
[03:25:39.771 --> 03:25:43.593]  I'm going to say all the rules don't apply, and I'm going to do whatever I have to.
[03:25:43.973 --> 03:25:48.737]  I'm going to suspend your free speech because I don't want to debate science with you when it's climate change.
[03:25:49.377 --> 03:25:55.421]  I don't want to hear what you have to say, so I'm going to call you a hateful racist and shut you down with hate speech laws.
[03:25:55.882 --> 03:25:57.423]  I'm going to do whatever I can.
[03:25:58.163 --> 03:26:06.107]  To silence, to censor you, to pervert the law, the rule of law, the rules of democracy, the rules of our republic, just so I can get my way.
[03:26:07.067 --> 03:26:08.668]  This is what we're seeing increasingly.
[03:26:08.688 --> 03:26:11.770]  So I want to break this down because, as I pointed out before,
[03:26:13.117 --> 03:26:15.918]  Justice Alito could barely contain his anger.
[03:26:16.399 --> 03:26:19.940]  He was rocking back and forth in his seat, and I would have been too if I had been there.
[03:26:20.480 --> 03:26:21.781]  I would have been going back and forth.
[03:26:21.801 --> 03:26:23.602]  I was like, I can't believe this is happening.
[03:26:24.142 --> 03:26:28.364]  This is just, we're throwing everything out, and we've seen the Supreme Court do this before.
[03:26:28.404 --> 03:26:30.345]  We saw them do it on gay marriage.
[03:26:30.385 --> 03:26:33.587]  Regardless of what you think about gay marriage, they have no jurisdiction.
[03:26:34.027 --> 03:26:39.449]  Where is it in the Supreme Court that says the federal government will have jurisdiction over defining marriage?
[03:26:39.750 --> 03:26:42.371]  There is nothing in the Constitution that delegates that to them.
[03:26:43.663 --> 03:26:48.285]  We had people who were very concerned who did not want to have a federal government.
[03:26:48.325 --> 03:26:49.866]  The Anti-Federalists, they called them.
[03:26:50.786 --> 03:26:52.087]  They said, we don't want to have this.
[03:26:52.327 --> 03:27:00.551]  We know that this is going to turn into a monster that is going to dictate the most minute details of our lives, assuming and concentrating power to itself.
[03:27:00.791 --> 03:27:01.791]  And that's what's happened.
[03:27:02.532 --> 03:27:03.892]  And so they passed the Bill of Rights.
[03:27:03.912 --> 03:27:07.834]  And they said, this is off-limits, that's off-limits, that's off-limits, that's off-limits.
[03:27:08.214 --> 03:27:10.996]  And then they said, oh, and by the way, in case we forgot anything,
[03:27:11.988 --> 03:27:19.809]  We're going to write a 9th and a 10th Amendment and we're going to say, if we didn't specifically give this power to you specifically, then you don't have it.
[03:27:20.810 --> 03:27:25.611]  Anything that's not been delegated to you remains the power of the people and of the state governments.
[03:27:25.731 --> 03:27:27.471]  That's the 9th and 10th Amendment, essentially.
[03:27:27.931 --> 03:27:28.771]  They just ignore that.
[03:27:29.571 --> 03:27:35.432]  And if they like the cause, the Supreme Court has shown that it will just set aside all the legal process.
[03:27:35.472 --> 03:27:38.493]  And this is why Judge Alito was so upset about this.
[03:27:39.215 --> 03:27:40.095]  And we had other people on.
[03:27:40.135 --> 03:27:43.716]  We've had Lionel when we were talking about the gay marriage thing.
[03:27:43.736 --> 03:27:44.657]  He thought it was a good deal.
[03:27:44.677 --> 03:27:46.877]  I don't like that definition of marriage.
[03:27:47.418 --> 03:27:50.939]  But we both agreed that they don't have any legal authority to define it.
[03:27:52.279 --> 03:27:56.601]  So, I mean, it's something that ought to be decided at the state levels, at the community levels.
[03:27:56.641 --> 03:28:00.402]  Before I get back to that, real quickly, we have a couple of sales that are ending soon.
[03:28:01.510 --> 03:28:02.391]  I want to let you know about these.
[03:28:02.691 --> 03:28:04.873]  That's the 20% off for Deep Cleanse.
[03:28:05.293 --> 03:28:11.539]  And of course, when we put our best seller on a deep discount like this, it isn't going to last long.
[03:28:12.120 --> 03:28:14.262]  And so that sale is not going to last long.
[03:28:14.282 --> 03:28:17.525]  This is our Rolls-Royce, our all-in-one cleansing product.
[03:28:17.845 --> 03:28:23.950]  Instead of buying five, six, or seven different cleansing products, we've used decades of scientific research to put together
[03:28:24.611 --> 03:28:25.471]  Deep Cleanze.
[03:28:25.571 --> 03:28:27.372]  And again, it is our best-selling product.
[03:28:27.432 --> 03:28:28.932]  We've put it on a deep discount.
[03:28:29.252 --> 03:28:30.833]  20% off at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:28:30.873 --> 03:28:31.973]  That's not going to last much longer.
[03:28:32.093 --> 03:28:34.233]  Also, the Hillary for Prison t-shirts.
[03:28:34.914 --> 03:28:36.634]  That is going to be ending soon as well.
[03:28:37.334 --> 03:28:47.497]  If you get the Hillary for Prison t-shirts, you can get 75% off the Hillary for Prison t-shirts if you sign up for the InfoWars newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:28:48.157 --> 03:28:54.481]  We're going to be forced to pull this special very soon because they are going very quickly, you can imagine, at that kind of a discount.
[03:28:54.501 --> 03:28:59.524]  It's a huge discount off of t-shirts that are already very competitively priced for t-shirts.
[03:28:59.684 --> 03:29:13.293]  It is a great design and to say the least, it will be a conversation starter because as we've seen many times, many people look at it as such a dead ringer knockoff of the Hillary for President
[03:29:15.354 --> 03:29:15.594]  I don't
[03:29:38.607 --> 03:29:50.577]  They are ruining our future and you've seen the memes on social media where they show the inversion that the vast majority of people who are younger voted to stay in and vice versa at the old age.
[03:29:50.597 --> 03:29:51.458]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:51.978 --> 03:29:53.580]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.521 --> 03:29:57.183]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.986 --> 03:30:05.047]  Finally, the mainstream media is reporting on what we broke two years ago.
[03:30:05.067 --> 03:30:05.568]  The U.S.
[03:30:05.628 --> 03:30:12.851]  Customs and Border Patrol, under pressure from the Obama administration, is purchasing bus tickets for illegals to ship them deeper into the country at taxpayers' expense.
[03:30:13.031 --> 03:30:24.875]  Local news station KRGV is now covering how the McAllen, Texas bus station is used as a transit hub for illegals Obama is bringing into the country, which Infowars.com exclusively broke in 2014 when no one else dared to report on it.
[03:30:24.955 --> 03:30:29.837]  KRGV revealed that over 100 illegals a day are being dropped off at the McAllen station, and in 2014,
[03:30:31.218 --> 03:30:37.323]  InfoWars reported on how the Obama administration was ordering the Border Patrol to release illegals they've apprehended after crossing the border.
[03:30:37.423 --> 03:30:46.209]  But, as part of their release, the illegals are transported to the McAllen bus station by Border Patrol agents, who then buy them tickets to go wherever they want to go in the U.S.
[03:30:46.450 --> 03:30:50.072]  So, for example, if the illegals have relatives in Boston, that's where they get to go.
[03:30:50.292 --> 03:30:53.295]  And taxpayers are paying for this illegal smuggling operation.
[03:30:53.435 --> 03:30:57.158]  To find out more about Obama's lawlessness, visit InfoWars.com.
[03:30:57.338 --> 03:30:58.619]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[03:31:01.368 --> 03:31:02.389]  Brain Force is here.
[03:31:02.910 --> 03:31:05.192]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:31:05.472 --> 03:31:13.280]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[03:31:14.059 --> 03:31:17.641]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[03:31:17.661 --> 03:31:20.003]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[03:31:20.363 --> 03:31:23.886]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:31:23.926 --> 03:31:27.068]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:31:27.568 --> 03:31:32.371]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[03:31:32.912 --> 03:31:34.733]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[03:31:35.093 --> 03:31:39.536]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[03:31:39.676 --> 03:31:41.678]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[03:31:42.318 --> 03:31:43.779]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[03:31:43.919 --> 03:31:44.059]  Exactly.
[03:31:44.079 --> 03:31:47.964]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[03:31:48.485 --> 03:31:55.754]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:31:56.034 --> 03:31:56.474]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[03:32:02.569 --> 03:32:05.991]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:32:06.352 --> 03:32:13.476]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:32:14.077 --> 03:32:22.482]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:32:22.682 --> 03:32:26.805]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:32:27.125 --> 03:32:32.449]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[03:32:32.689 --> 03:32:36.532]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:32:36.932 --> 03:32:40.114]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:32:40.354 --> 03:32:51.442]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:32:51.502 --> 03:32:54.184]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[03:32:54.404 --> 03:33:00.368]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at Infowarslife.com with AnthroPlex.
[03:33:10.737 --> 03:33:15.909]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:15.989 --> 03:33:16.510]  Mother!
[03:33:20.871 --> 03:33:21.992]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.052 --> 03:33:27.357]  I'm David Knight, and we're talking about the do-over mentality that we've got here.
[03:33:27.397 --> 03:33:33.402]  The spoiled brats everywhere, from Britain to the Supreme Court to the Republican Party.
[03:33:33.762 --> 03:33:34.743]  I didn't get my way.
[03:33:35.163 --> 03:33:36.584]  I want it done over again.
[03:33:36.604 --> 03:33:37.825]  I don't care what the rules are.
[03:33:37.946 --> 03:33:38.806]  I want it my way.
[03:33:39.307 --> 03:33:40.388]  That's exactly what they're saying.
[03:33:41.168 --> 03:33:43.851]  And that's what Justice Alito was pointing out the Supreme Court just did.
[03:33:44.662 --> 03:33:54.928]  And so, to summarize what I was saying earlier, what he did was, he said, look, they already appealed this, they lost at a circuit court level, they did not appeal it to the Supreme Court, so that decision was final.
[03:33:55.448 --> 03:34:01.972]  Now they have come back with exactly the same case, exactly the same law, and tried to appeal it again.
[03:34:02.712 --> 03:34:03.533]  They've already lost.
[03:34:04.013 --> 03:34:04.733]  We don't allow that.
[03:34:05.054 --> 03:34:06.694]  The Supreme Court has said, that's not allowed.
[03:34:06.895 --> 03:34:08.596]  It's a legal principle, that's not allowed.
[03:34:09.156 --> 03:34:10.737]  And then he goes on to say, and here's another
[03:34:11.527 --> 03:34:12.527]  principle that they have here.
[03:34:12.547 --> 03:34:13.688]  He says, it doesn't even matter.
[03:34:13.708 --> 03:34:18.289]  He says, I understand abortion is a very contentious and divisive issue.
[03:34:18.689 --> 03:34:20.009]  This doesn't even get to that.
[03:34:20.369 --> 03:34:22.950]  It's a question of legal procedure.
[03:34:23.250 --> 03:34:28.412]  If you lose a case and you don't appeal it, you don't get a chance at a later date to re-litigate.
[03:34:29.152 --> 03:34:29.712]  A do-over.
[03:34:30.232 --> 03:34:30.512]  Okay?
[03:34:30.572 --> 03:34:31.093]  That's what he said.
[03:34:31.393 --> 03:34:36.754]  And then he goes, you've got another standard rule of law that is ignored as well.
[03:34:37.354 --> 03:34:39.375]  He said, it's a severability clause.
[03:34:40.319 --> 03:34:50.981]  The court's treatment of this Texas law's severability clause, he says, when part of a statute is held to be unconstitutional, the question arises whether other parts of the statute must also go.
[03:34:51.001 --> 03:34:59.723]  If a statute says the provisions found that are unconstitutional can be severed from the rest of the statute, the valid provisions are allowed to stand.
[03:34:59.923 --> 03:35:00.403]  You understand?
[03:35:00.963 --> 03:35:05.924]  So they come in here and they say, well, you know, we don't like this rule about the fact that you have to be admitted to a hospital.
[03:35:06.445 --> 03:35:08.045]  We think that's too much of a burden.
[03:35:08.755 --> 03:35:09.255]  Okay, fine.
[03:35:09.776 --> 03:35:22.245]  Then the other parts that say you've got to meet fire code inspections if you're going to do medical procedures in this little house that you just bought and you've now put a shingle out and said, this is a health clinic for women.
[03:35:22.745 --> 03:35:23.325]  Okay, fine.
[03:35:23.606 --> 03:35:26.087]  Let's make sure they don't burn up while they're being treated there.
[03:35:26.107 --> 03:35:32.952]  Let's make sure that you can get gurneys inside here if somebody has to get pulled out quickly with an ambulance.
[03:35:33.392 --> 03:35:34.093]  Issues like that.
[03:35:34.213 --> 03:35:34.914]  Safety issues.
[03:35:35.574 --> 03:35:37.716]  And he says, for example,
[03:35:38.530 --> 03:35:45.573]  He says, uh, if provisions can be found unconstitutional, can be severed from the rest of the statute, the valid provisions are allowed to stand.
[03:35:46.233 --> 03:35:51.316]  This law contains what surely must be the most emphatic severability clause that was ever written.
[03:35:51.336 --> 03:35:57.458]  In other words, they say in this law, we've got all these different things here, and each one of them is severable.
[03:35:57.999 --> 03:35:59.940]  These are all separate regulations.
[03:36:00.700 --> 03:36:02.721]  It isn't all together, all or nothing.
[03:36:03.061 --> 03:36:04.762]  Each one of these things are separate.
[03:36:05.697 --> 03:36:07.438]  And he says this is very explicit.
[03:36:07.478 --> 03:36:13.823]  He said the clause says every single word of the statute and every possible application of its provisions are severable.
[03:36:14.324 --> 03:36:25.572]  He says provisions that are indisputably constitutional, for example, provisions that require facilities performing abortions to follow basic fire safety measures are stricken now from the book.
[03:36:26.353 --> 03:36:26.653]  Okay?
[03:36:26.973 --> 03:36:28.414]  Based on the Supreme Court decision.
[03:36:28.895 --> 03:36:31.457]  So they took all of the regulations out.
[03:36:32.503 --> 03:36:37.008]  He says there's absolutely no possible justification for this collateral damage.
[03:36:37.129 --> 03:36:42.515]  Now let me read you the nonsense that was put out here by these five Supreme Court justices.
[03:36:43.016 --> 03:36:44.578]  This is the basis for their decision.
[03:36:45.560 --> 03:36:50.565]  The number of facilities providing abortions dropped in half, and this is actually a Supreme Court decision.
[03:36:50.845 --> 03:36:56.230]  This is not a New York Times analysis of what's going on.
[03:36:56.310 --> 03:37:02.236]  This is what the Supreme Court justices said was the basis for their ruling.
[03:37:02.836 --> 03:37:08.057]  The number of facilities providing abortions dropped in half from about 40 to about 20.
[03:37:08.657 --> 03:37:16.178]  This decrease in geographical distribution means that the number of women of reproductive age living more than 50 miles from the clinic has doubled.
[03:37:16.438 --> 03:37:19.259]  The number living more than 100 miles away has increased by 150 percent.
[03:37:19.279 --> 03:37:21.119]  The number living more than 150 miles away by more than 350 percent.
[03:37:21.139 --> 03:37:22.959]  The number living more than 200 miles away by more than 2,800 percent.
[03:37:22.979 --> 03:37:23.720]  You see the issue here?
[03:37:23.740 --> 03:37:24.420]  This is an issue of
[03:37:32.568 --> 03:37:35.413]  Whether or not they want people to have abortions.
[03:37:35.493 --> 03:37:39.841]  It doesn't even address the legal issues that Judge Alito was so upset about.
[03:37:40.984 --> 03:37:54.052]  They just said, well, we like abortions, we want them to be plentiful and easily accessible, and so we don't like this, and we're going to strike all of the rules, including fire safety codes, because, you know, this is about women's health.
[03:37:54.692 --> 03:37:55.933]  This is about women's health, isn't it?
[03:37:56.494 --> 03:37:57.794]  What a baloney!
[03:37:58.034 --> 03:38:04.278]  You know, here are these people who have absolutely no health regulations in abortion clinics.
[03:38:04.298 --> 03:38:05.359]  They struck them all.
[03:38:06.280 --> 03:38:10.042]  Yet they want to regulate every tiny detail of bathrooms.
[03:38:11.852 --> 03:38:13.033]  They don't have an agenda, do they?
[03:38:14.875 --> 03:38:16.196]  No agenda whatsoever.
[03:38:16.256 --> 03:38:17.578]  Look at the University of North Carolina.
[03:38:17.818 --> 03:38:20.500]  Christmas vacation is now a microaggression.
[03:38:21.499 --> 03:38:25.041]  As I point out before, this is an article that's up on InfoWars.com from The Daily Caller.
[03:38:25.622 --> 03:38:35.808]  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill issued a guide this week which instructs students at Christmas vacations and telling a woman, I love your shoes, are microaggressions along with things like boyfriend and girlfriend.
[03:38:36.088 --> 03:38:38.449]  So watch your speech, okay?
[03:38:38.950 --> 03:38:39.610]  Watch your speech.
[03:38:40.510 --> 03:38:42.712]  There's no free speech at this university.
[03:38:43.800 --> 03:38:46.584]  At the same time, again, we're talking about agendas here, okay?
[03:38:46.704 --> 03:38:53.933]  We've got Obama declares Stonewall Inn to be the first national monument to LGBT rights.
[03:38:54.153 --> 03:38:55.054]  This is from The Guardian.
[03:38:56.001 --> 03:39:10.670]  Barack Obama announced on Friday that the Stonewall National Monument will be created outside the Stonewall Inn in New York, where gay men, lesbians, and drag queens reacted to a police raid in 1969 with a riot that spread and turned into the gay rights movement in America and around the world.
[03:39:11.211 --> 03:39:19.616]  Obama confirmed the widely expected news that he will be designating the first ever national monument to the LGBT equality movement.
[03:39:19.896 --> 03:39:21.037]  Okay, so, here you go.
[03:39:21.517 --> 03:39:21.917]  That's his
[03:39:23.117 --> 03:39:23.858]  That's his monument.
[03:39:24.098 --> 03:39:34.868]  Now, because that's his agenda, that's what he thinks is important, but understand what is happening as he's going in other parts, rural areas of the country.
[03:39:35.749 --> 03:39:39.672]  He's going in and saying, well, this is a very special petroglyph here, for example.
[03:39:40.680 --> 03:40:02.205]  And as I point out, we've done this report, I did it with Rob Jacobson, we need to update it now because they found a lady who was going out and using paint on these petroglyphs and you had Harry Reid blaming it on the Bundy people and all these evil people associated with them and yet we find out that it was like a twenty-something girl who was doing
[03:40:04.707 --> 03:40:13.505]  Um, graffiti, and actually they caught her because she's putting it on Facebook, okay, and doing it with paint over these ancient Indian petroglyphs.
[03:40:15.293 --> 03:40:16.134]  Obama is coming out.
[03:40:16.174 --> 03:40:28.382]  Not only are they falsely blaming the people that they are destroying their way of life, taking their property rights, taking their grazing rights, their mining rights, their surface and water rights, their logging rights, you name it.
[03:40:28.622 --> 03:40:32.485]  All these rights have been held since these states came into the Union.
[03:40:33.006 --> 03:40:35.387]  And these are property rights, just like your home is a property right.
[03:40:35.807 --> 03:40:36.808]  They're saying, we've got to have that.
[03:40:37.289 --> 03:40:40.511]  We've got to have millions of acres because of a petroglyph over here.
[03:40:40.891 --> 03:40:48.609]  And oh, by the way, those petroglyphs are being vandalized, and we're getting graffiti put on them, and I know it's those Bundy people, I just know it's them.
[03:40:49.251 --> 03:40:49.651]  And it's not.
[03:40:50.472 --> 03:40:54.714]  And they don't need to take millions upon millions of acres in order to protect that.
[03:40:55.134 --> 03:40:58.756]  A good example is one of the earlier monuments that we had in the National Park Service.
[03:40:59.217 --> 03:41:00.237]  We talked about this in the report.
[03:41:00.277 --> 03:41:00.877]  Devil's Tower.
[03:41:00.917 --> 03:41:01.978]  You know Devil's Tower?
[03:41:02.738 --> 03:41:08.461]  The tower that you see in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
[03:41:08.481 --> 03:41:09.422]  Was it Third Kind?
[03:41:09.562 --> 03:41:09.802]  I think.
[03:41:09.882 --> 03:41:11.063]  Anyway, that's a Spielberg movie.
[03:41:11.503 --> 03:41:12.744]  Not one of my favorites, okay?
[03:41:13.104 --> 03:41:15.385]  But you know, he does the thing of mashed potatoes on the
[03:41:17.606 --> 03:41:21.709]  Kitchen table, and they all have this vision, and they all assemble at Devil's Tower.
[03:41:23.030 --> 03:41:28.974]  To preserve Devil's Tower, they needed one and a half acres, about the size of a football field.
[03:41:29.554 --> 03:41:35.098]  And yet, they're telling us because of some of these small petroglyphs, they need literally millions of acres.
[03:41:35.882 --> 03:41:37.843]  They lie about everything.
[03:41:38.323 --> 03:41:42.686]  They lie about the purpose of it, and they lie about why it is needed.
[03:41:42.726 --> 03:41:54.752]  And it's interesting, tomorrow there's going to be a recall election in Burns, Oregon, near where that wildlife refuge was taken over by the Bundys, and the people in that town are very upset with the county judge.
[03:41:55.032 --> 03:41:57.954]  Kind of equivalent to what we have here in Texas, I believe.
[03:41:58.614 --> 03:42:02.456]  The county judge is equivalent to the mayor of a city, okay?
[03:42:02.696 --> 03:42:05.078]  Is to a county what a mayor is to a city.
[03:42:05.618 --> 03:42:07.099]  And there's a recall election there.
[03:42:07.119 --> 03:42:17.929]  A lot of people who are business owners, here's one of them, Linda Gaynor, said the business she got from journalists, agents, occupiers, protesters against the occupation, and from protesters protesting the protesters.
[03:42:18.450 --> 03:42:19.851]  She said she had a lot of business there.
[03:42:19.871 --> 03:42:21.492]  She said, I met really awesome people.
[03:42:21.713 --> 03:42:24.135]  Everybody that came through was very polite.
[03:42:24.875 --> 03:42:26.477]  And we should have had a meeting there.
[03:42:27.077 --> 03:42:28.198]  And yet, this guy
[03:42:29.475 --> 03:42:44.087]  This judge, that they're trying to recall, would not allow anyone to have a meeting to talk about how the government was stealing millions of acres and stealing people's property rights that they had had for 150 years in many cases.
[03:42:44.728 --> 03:42:45.768]  And that's the issue, folks.
[03:42:46.149 --> 03:42:47.270]  That truly is the issue.
[03:42:47.290 --> 03:42:51.413]  You've got another business owner who's afraid to put his name out there.
[03:42:51.453 --> 03:42:52.534]  He's afraid of reprisals.
[03:42:53.515 --> 03:42:54.636]  That's an issue too, isn't it?
[03:42:55.316 --> 03:43:00.437]  In America, we're afraid to speak out publicly because we're afraid of reprisals.
[03:43:00.997 --> 03:43:05.419]  And so they're going to have an election tomorrow to see whether or not that guy is going to be recalled.
[03:43:05.479 --> 03:43:07.899]  I certainly hope that that is going to be the case.
[03:43:08.359 --> 03:43:10.760]  But just look at the fraud that is involved there.
[03:43:10.780 --> 03:43:22.023]  I want to talk about the other whiners and people calling for do-overs, and that's within the political aspect here of the Republican National Committee.
[03:43:23.015 --> 03:43:31.021]  We've had a long time that these people have been moving to try to subvert the elections, just like they are in Britain.
[03:43:31.041 --> 03:43:32.943]  They didn't like the outcome.
[03:43:32.963 --> 03:43:34.584]  They didn't like the fact that Trump won.
[03:43:34.664 --> 03:43:36.105]  So they said, well, we're going to steal it.
[03:43:36.145 --> 03:43:37.946]  And we don't really care what the rules are.
[03:43:38.347 --> 03:43:51.197]  And so now we've got a Virginia delegate who has filed a class action lawsuit this last Friday, challenging a state law, the Virginia law, that binds delegates to support the primary winner at the nominating convention.
[03:43:52.116 --> 03:43:54.218]  He says, and his name is Beau Correll.
[03:43:55.220 --> 03:43:57.743]  He's a Republican National Convention delegate.
[03:43:57.823 --> 03:44:01.527]  He served as one of Ted Cruz's campaign co-chairs in Virginia.
[03:44:02.308 --> 03:44:08.034]  And he's the only named plaintiff in the suit, but he says he's filing it on behalf of all Republicans and all Democrats.
[03:44:08.074 --> 03:44:11.478]  And I think we ought to call this the superdelegate.
[03:44:12.239 --> 03:44:15.940]  Lawsuit because what he's trying to do is establish super delegates.
[03:44:16.841 --> 03:44:34.167]  He says this is really awful He says I'm a delegate and I don't like Donald Trump and I don't like who the millions of Virginia voters picked and now my First Amendment choices are being shut down and we have a parallel article coming out at the same time interestingly enough
[03:44:34.927 --> 03:44:39.357]  Interestingly enough, from the National Review, and from David French.
[03:44:39.958 --> 03:44:40.800]  Remember David French?
[03:44:41.481 --> 03:44:43.205]  He was Bill Kristol's puppet.
[03:44:44.258 --> 03:44:54.283]  Bill Kristol of the Weekly Standard, spelled W-E-A-K with an E and an A. We were told he had this independent candidate.
[03:44:54.323 --> 03:44:55.244]  This guy was really strong.
[03:44:55.264 --> 03:44:56.864]  He's going to be a very viable candidate.
[03:44:56.905 --> 03:45:02.587]  Well, David French is nothing but a reporter for National Review and the Weekly Standard.
[03:45:03.088 --> 03:45:05.849]  And his candidacy lasted, I think, less than a week.
[03:45:06.209 --> 03:45:09.011]  But now, interestingly enough, for the National Review, he's written
[03:45:09.651 --> 03:45:18.657]  An article saying not a single Republican delegate is bound to Donald Trump, and using the same arguments that this guy in Virginia is using in his lawsuit.
[03:45:19.217 --> 03:45:20.378]  Just a coincidence, I'm sure.
[03:45:20.538 --> 03:45:20.938]  Don't you think?
[03:45:21.659 --> 03:45:25.941]  Nah, no conspiracy here to try to subvert the will of the people in the elections.
[03:45:26.001 --> 03:45:27.122]  No, that would never happen.
[03:45:27.642 --> 03:45:29.023]  Now, this is what the complaint says.
[03:45:29.363 --> 03:45:30.044]  Here's their argument.
[03:45:30.831 --> 03:45:44.417]  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees delegates to the Republican Party and the Democrat Party's national conventions the right to vote their conscience free from government compulsion when participating in selection of their party's presidential nominee, okay?
[03:45:44.557 --> 03:45:54.101]  Nevertheless, the Virginia law acts to strip them of that right, imposing criminal penalties on delegates who vote for anyone other than the primary winner on the first ballot of a national convention.
[03:45:54.262 --> 03:45:55.902]  Oh, other than the primary winner!
[03:45:56.082 --> 03:45:57.863]  Oh, where did that, how did that happen?
[03:45:58.223 --> 03:45:59.484]  What, you say we had these elections?
[03:45:59.704 --> 03:46:21.510]  We had these things called elections that we used to, you know, honor, and we spent a lot of money in the state of Virginia to run those elections for the Republican Party, and there were certain things that were put out there, assurances to people, like, hey, you know, you vote this, we're going to have, Trump is going to get delegates, or Cruz is going to get delegates, so Trump won the delegates, and then Cruz went around and tried to steal them again, okay?
[03:46:24.236 --> 03:46:26.258]  What is the problem with this?
[03:46:26.278 --> 03:46:29.081]  Why is it that we can say, well, here's the election.
[03:46:29.121 --> 03:46:31.323]  These are the number of votes that Donald Trump got.
[03:46:31.403 --> 03:46:35.767]  He won Virginia overwhelmingly, like these other states.
[03:46:35.867 --> 03:46:46.938]  And then we say, but wait a minute, now that Ted Cruz has come in and oiled his way across the floor and wined and dined these people, now they're not going to vote the way the voters wanted.
[03:46:47.850 --> 03:46:56.198]  Okay, so I would ask Beau Corl, and I would ask the GOP, what makes you think that you're so much better than everybody else?
[03:46:57.018 --> 03:47:06.247]  And I would say that really what needs to be done, they filed a part of their lawsuit, said that they were worried that Donald Trump
[03:47:07.321 --> 03:47:09.263]  would file a lawsuit against them.
[03:47:09.463 --> 03:47:19.413]  They say, because Donald Trump, they said, is quote, known to be litigious and has brought lawsuits of questionable merit against persons for the apparent purpose of harassing or punishing them.
[03:47:19.453 --> 03:47:22.436]  And I said, wait a minute, isn't that what this lawsuit is?
[03:47:23.217 --> 03:47:26.639]  Isn't this a litigious, frivolous lawsuit?
[03:47:27.260 --> 03:47:37.867]  Isn't this a means of harassing and punishing the voters of Virginia who didn't vote the way this little clique of elitists that think that they are the GOP party?
[03:47:37.967 --> 03:47:42.090]  No, the GOP party is the voters and they're going to find this out if they try to do this.
[03:47:42.730 --> 03:47:49.755]  Now, they say that, he says, I just can't follow in my own conscience, I just can't vote for Trump.
[03:47:49.775 --> 03:47:51.036]  It's like, fine, don't go.
[03:47:51.957 --> 03:47:52.257]  Don't go.
[03:47:52.457 --> 03:47:52.937]  You can leave.
[03:47:53.418 --> 03:47:54.618]  Let somebody else take your place.
[03:47:54.698 --> 03:47:55.479]  They have alternates.
[03:47:56.339 --> 03:48:03.802]  And you have to understand, as I pointed out before, when you go to the Electoral College, it's a winner-take-all, state-by-state.
[03:48:04.582 --> 03:48:10.885]  So, if Hillary Clinton wins Texas, she's got a slate of electors from Texas who are going to go to the Electoral College.
[03:48:11.445 --> 03:48:14.307]  Same thing for the Republican candidate, for Donald Trump, okay?
[03:48:14.767 --> 03:48:17.468]  He's got a slate of Trump electors who are going to go there.
[03:48:18.579 --> 03:48:20.960]  And that's what people expect.
[03:48:21.080 --> 03:48:22.601]  That's what it says in the law.
[03:48:22.641 --> 03:48:26.422]  That's what it says in the bylaws of the Republican Party.
[03:48:26.462 --> 03:48:28.923]  So the Republican Party's rules and laws say that.
[03:48:28.983 --> 03:48:33.225]  The state's laws say that because they paid to run this election for these people.
[03:48:33.745 --> 03:48:46.630]  And it is nothing but racketeering and corruption for them to lie to the American people and to say, here's our election, and then come around the back door and say, but no, we had another election and our decision
[03:48:47.310 --> 03:48:48.571]  Matters more than your decision.
[03:48:48.611 --> 03:48:50.372]  That's what we're seeing in the Democrat Party as well.
[03:48:50.632 --> 03:48:52.094]  They call it the superdelegates there.
[03:48:52.394 --> 03:48:54.215]  But now we're seeing that in the Republican Party.
[03:48:55.196 --> 03:49:00.099]  Now let's talk about Brexit, because we got a bunch of whining people who want to break the rules there as well.
[03:49:01.260 --> 03:49:05.063]  You got the Millennials venting fury at the baby boomers.
[03:49:05.083 --> 03:49:06.424]  This is a Daily Mail article.
[03:49:06.464 --> 03:49:09.146]  They say 72% of the 18 to 24 year olds voted against Brexit.
[03:49:12.270 --> 03:49:28.897]  And of course you've seen, if you look at social media, you've seen on Twitter and on Facebook, you've seen the graphic that says, you know, age of the people and how many of them voted to remain, how many of them voted to leave, and they say, look at the life expectancy of these people.
[03:49:29.537 --> 03:49:37.401]  And they go down, they show the older people voted to leave, and they say, look at this, they don't have to live with this decision, it's the young people who have to live with this decision.
[03:49:38.444 --> 03:49:39.945]  This is so unfair!
[03:49:39.965 --> 03:49:41.165]  I want another vote!
[03:49:41.806 --> 03:49:42.086]  Okay.
[03:49:42.686 --> 03:49:51.691]  Well, let me say to the young people out there that the reason the older people voted to leave is because they have lived with that decision.
[03:49:52.631 --> 03:49:53.591]  They made that decision.
[03:49:54.212 --> 03:49:55.112]  The Baby Boomers did.
[03:49:55.192 --> 03:49:57.373]  They were part of a generation that made that decision back in 1975.
[03:49:57.573 --> 03:50:00.675]  They said, we're not going to leave.
[03:50:00.695 --> 03:50:01.976]  There was a decision then.
[03:50:02.970 --> 03:50:14.816]  Voted overwhelmingly to remain in, and again, this is a story that I covered on Friday from The Telegraph, Tim Stanley, the day the British people defied their jailers.
[03:50:15.816 --> 03:50:21.619]  And he pointed out, he said, David Cameron only called this in order to hold his own party together.
[03:50:21.779 --> 03:50:26.522]  Once it was called, he decided to turn the British and the global establishment against it.
[03:50:27.589 --> 03:50:33.556]  Out came the Treasury, the IMF, even the President of the United States to argue that Britain had to stay.
[03:50:34.277 --> 03:50:43.867]  This was textbook politics, how things used to be done, and it did work back in 1975 when the UK voted overwhelmingly on good advice to stay in the common market.
[03:50:44.602 --> 03:50:45.542]  But what have they found now?
[03:50:46.283 --> 03:50:48.884]  They've found that this is not an economic union.
[03:50:49.644 --> 03:50:51.545]  It is a political union.
[03:50:52.065 --> 03:50:53.866]  They found they lost their sovereignty.
[03:50:54.446 --> 03:50:57.688]  And when they lost their sovereignty, they got a bad deal economically.
[03:50:58.068 --> 03:51:00.669]  They got a bad deal with everything, with immigration.
[03:51:01.909 --> 03:51:03.310]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:51:03.350 --> 03:51:04.430]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:51:04.691 --> 03:51:05.611]  Why is this so good?
[03:51:05.891 --> 03:51:11.133]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:51:11.213 --> 03:51:24.779]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:51:24.839 --> 03:51:26.200]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:51:26.980 --> 03:51:28.562]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:51:28.642 --> 03:51:31.125]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:51:31.225 --> 03:51:32.487]  These are all parasites.
[03:51:32.527 --> 03:51:33.628]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:51:33.648 --> 03:51:34.689]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:51:34.990 --> 03:51:41.597]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, you have enzyme blend in there.
[03:51:41.637 --> 03:51:46.844]  This is very important because a lot of these microorganisms, and even going up to tapeworms, pinworms,
[03:51:47.384 --> 03:51:49.567]  You have to disintegrate the lining.
[03:51:49.587 --> 03:51:54.592]  I mean, viruses protect themselves and so do bacteria and protozoa and mycoplasms.
[03:51:54.973 --> 03:51:59.217]  They have a protective shell that a lot of times the immune system can't even get into.
[03:51:59.418 --> 03:52:00.459]  Our own immune system.
[03:52:01.019 --> 03:52:03.722]  Especially since most people's immune system are weak anyway.
[03:52:04.443 --> 03:52:15.348]  So we actually designed the Living Defense and put in a specific blend of enzymes which actually chew and eat through the lining of these different organisms.
[03:52:15.928 --> 03:52:17.569]  So the Living Defense is amazing.
[03:52:17.989 --> 03:52:20.050]  We've seen just tremendous reviews.
[03:52:20.730 --> 03:52:22.891]  How often should you take Living Defense?
[03:52:22.971 --> 03:52:24.272]  I mean, is it a regimen every day?
[03:52:24.332 --> 03:52:26.153]  That's what I was doing until we ran out.
[03:52:26.493 --> 03:52:28.213]  Or do you do it heavier for certain cleanses?
[03:52:28.233 --> 03:52:29.034]  What do you do, Dr. Group?
[03:52:29.744 --> 03:52:41.350]  Well, I do usually six weeks at a time, because if you look at the life cycle of most parasites, it's six weeks from the time... So you've got to kill the ones that are in there and then kill their babies when they hatch that job.
[03:52:41.630 --> 03:52:51.516]  If you're suffering from abdominal pain, allergies, even like headaches, anemia, weakened immune system, gut problems, depression, hair loss,
[03:52:52.576 --> 03:52:55.078]  Excess gas, muscle pain, nervousness.
[03:52:55.138 --> 03:52:56.178]  I mean, all these things.
[03:52:56.439 --> 03:52:57.559]  Doctors don't know.
[03:52:57.619 --> 03:53:01.261]  They don't teach doctors in medical school about parasites and harmful organisms.
[03:53:01.301 --> 03:53:03.423]  There's a reason why they don't teach them about that.
[03:53:03.503 --> 03:53:09.486]  Just like they don't teach doctors about the root cause of disease and how to eliminate all disease out there.
[03:53:09.526 --> 03:53:10.927]  They don't want you to know about it.
[03:53:11.187 --> 03:53:13.889]  You don't want your own immune system being attacked.
[03:53:14.169 --> 03:53:17.551]  Again, you know, you have animals, especially your cats, dogs.
[03:53:17.591 --> 03:53:19.432]  So many people have pets these days.
[03:53:19.912 --> 03:53:21.233]  People eat raw sushi.
[03:53:21.713 --> 03:53:23.314]  People eat more raw food.
[03:53:23.374 --> 03:53:27.598]  You have all these different organisms showing up in the water supplies now.
[03:53:28.078 --> 03:53:31.421]  You even have it in the air supplies, these tiny microorganisms.
[03:53:31.461 --> 03:53:34.283]  So it's not like we can get away from them.
[03:53:34.343 --> 03:53:35.824]  We just have to do everything.
[03:53:35.904 --> 03:53:37.385]  I recommend doing a parasite
[03:53:38.306 --> 03:53:42.769]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:53:42.809 --> 03:53:43.810]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:53:43.850 --> 03:53:44.390]  Living Defense.
[03:53:44.690 --> 03:53:45.731]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:53:45.791 --> 03:53:46.831]  And, folks, you can't lose.
[03:53:47.072 --> 03:53:48.913]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:53:49.553 --> 03:53:51.414]  And you support the broadcast.
[03:53:51.474 --> 03:53:52.555]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:53:52.835 --> 03:53:54.736]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:53:55.097 --> 03:53:57.058]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:54:09.926 --> 03:54:11.908]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, June 27, 2016.
[03:54:12.289 --> 03:54:18.957]  I'm David Knight, and I want to get back to these whiners and Brexit, saying they want a do-over.
[03:54:19.277 --> 03:54:21.079]  I didn't like the legal process.
[03:54:21.139 --> 03:54:21.980]  I didn't like the results.
[03:54:22.000 --> 03:54:24.463]  Are they talking about being a 4% differential?
[03:54:24.523 --> 03:54:25.925]  No, really, it's 4% more.
[03:54:27.907 --> 03:54:32.290]  Then the 48% that leave got, that remain got, okay?
[03:54:32.330 --> 03:54:33.851]  So that's about a twelfth.
[03:54:34.452 --> 03:54:35.392]  So that's 8%.
[03:54:35.873 --> 03:54:39.876]  So it's 8% more people voted to get out than wanted to stay in.
[03:54:40.276 --> 03:54:41.497]  Four points, but 8% more votes.
[03:54:43.237 --> 03:54:44.657]  I'm going to get back to that real quickly.
[03:54:44.718 --> 03:54:47.839]  We have a couple of sales that are going to be ending soon.
[03:54:48.039 --> 03:54:52.800]  One of those, of course, is the Hillary for Prison t-shirt sale.

[03:55:23.695 --> 03:55:26.378]  And let me read you one of the many reviews.
[03:55:26.418 --> 03:55:29.421]  There are hundreds of reviews that you'll find on our website talking about it.
[03:55:29.481 --> 03:55:31.423]  This person says, I would buy this over and over again.
[03:55:31.883 --> 03:55:35.747]  This is Christian from an undisclosed location.
[03:55:35.787 --> 03:55:37.248]  Says, bought it for my uncle.
[03:55:37.288 --> 03:55:38.049]  He loves results.
[03:55:38.469 --> 03:55:39.310]  Long time smoker.
[03:55:39.671 --> 03:55:40.531]  Also a truck driver.
[03:55:40.571 --> 03:55:43.935]  Not the healthiest lifestyle, but within two weeks he felt a lot better.
[03:55:44.395 --> 03:55:47.656]  More energy, and also helped him to lose a little weight.
[03:55:48.056 --> 03:55:56.079]  Take a look at the reviews there, take a look at the product, and take advantage of this deep discount on Deep Cleanse.
[03:55:56.099 --> 03:55:58.399]  20% off at Infowarslife.com.
[03:55:59.620 --> 03:56:02.441]  Now as I was pointing out, let me go back and look at this.
[03:56:02.481 --> 03:56:06.262]  The people who remember this are the ones who voted to get this out.
[03:56:06.302 --> 03:56:08.142]  They have lived under this for 40 years.
[03:56:08.623 --> 03:56:09.583]  The Millennials haven't.
[03:56:10.404 --> 03:56:17.774]  There's this thing called experience, and I know that the kids who are in college and in high school don't really understand what experience is yet, okay?
[03:56:18.335 --> 03:56:21.038]  Think of it as a kind of college degree.
[03:56:22.250 --> 03:56:27.273]  A kind of an advanced graduate degree that takes you decades to get, okay?
[03:56:27.313 --> 03:56:30.034]  That might help it a little bit for you to swallow these results.
[03:56:30.474 --> 03:56:32.855]  And let me tell you, these people have seen it all before.
[03:56:33.456 --> 03:56:35.577]  There was a referendum back in 1975.
[03:56:36.117 --> 03:56:40.139]  In that referendum, two-thirds of the voters voted to stay in the EU.
[03:56:40.720 --> 03:56:50.925]  Within just a few years, this is an article from QZ.com, Britain's love-hate relationship with the EU, they say, within a few years they began tracking public opinion on the EU and Britain.
[03:56:51.525 --> 03:56:57.471]  They say by 1979, just four years later, it became clear that voters had begun to regret their 1975 decision.
[03:56:57.491 --> 03:57:03.797]  60% said they would vote to leave the EU if another referendum was called, while only 32% said they would stay.
[03:57:04.478 --> 03:57:06.239]  It has only gotten worse since then.
[03:57:07.284 --> 03:57:12.788]  And that's the reason why those old geezers voted to ruin your future.
[03:57:12.848 --> 03:57:14.869]  No, they saw what has happened here.
[03:57:15.409 --> 03:57:20.633]  They know that the EU has shut down fishermen from fishing in your own waters.
[03:57:20.993 --> 03:57:25.916]  They know that they have micromanaged every detail of your life, as we pointed out before.
[03:57:26.556 --> 03:57:28.938]  They know that it isn't an issue of racism.
[03:57:29.418 --> 03:57:32.440]  It isn't an issue of an economic leap into darkness.
[03:57:33.401 --> 03:57:34.862]  It is an issue of sovereignty.
[03:57:35.976 --> 03:57:42.962]  If you give up control of your life, your political control, then that is not a leap into darkness.
[03:57:43.002 --> 03:57:49.708]  You are marching into a known economic oblivion, because these people will control your economy.
[03:57:49.968 --> 03:57:54.132]  It's precisely what we're looking at with the Trans-Pacific and the Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[03:57:54.693 --> 03:57:59.837]  You're going to have people who are unelected who are going to be controlling every aspect of your economy.
[03:58:00.217 --> 03:58:01.499]  That's called sovereignty.
[03:58:02.199 --> 03:58:07.568]  And they're going to do things like open your borders and bring in workers as they export your jobs.
[03:58:07.588 --> 03:58:14.780]  Other areas are going to say, we're going to favor this country when they manufacture this good, but if you try to do that, we're going to shut you down.
[03:58:15.592 --> 03:58:16.172]  They've seen that.
[03:58:16.312 --> 03:58:17.612]  They've seen it for 40 years.
[03:58:17.672 --> 03:58:20.133]  That's why they said, we don't want this anymore.
[03:58:20.193 --> 03:58:21.693]  That's why they said, we're getting out.
[03:58:22.373 --> 03:58:28.174]  And he says, oh no, by the way, don't call people stupid losers when you don't agree with them.
[03:58:28.314 --> 03:58:32.575]  And don't try to throw away the rules because you don't get your way.
