[00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:22.426]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.507]  It's Monday, October 17, 2016.
[00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:26.489]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.070]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:30.832 --> 00:00:40.738]  Tonight, political terrorism strikes North Carolina as anti-Trump vandals firebomb the GOP headquarters.
[00:00:41.098 --> 00:00:47.202]  And Donald Trump says the act was committed by animals representing Hillary Clinton.
[00:00:52.235 --> 00:01:06.140]  Then, while Vladimir Putin tells the Russian people to prepare for war with the United States, a Kremlin insider says he believes there could be a major conflict before the election.
[00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:15.484]  Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden threatens Russia with a cyber attack, and the globalists close out all of Russia Today's UK bank accounts.
[00:01:16.084 --> 00:01:18.549]  And cut off WikiLeaks internet service.
[00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:25.102]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.385 --> 00:01:33.027]  Look, I'm not going to sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:01:33.287 --> 00:01:36.309]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.430]  Because it's already here.
[00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.470]  It's being announced.
[00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:42.293]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:01:42.773 --> 00:01:44.054]  You don't let them break your will.
[00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:56.763]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app and download an app that took us over a year to develop that we're going to be expanding on the next few months with free video and audio and podcast feeds and breaking news and alerts and so much more.
[00:01:57.023 --> 00:01:59.965]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:02:00.505 --> 00:02:04.807]  Take action!
[00:02:04.827 --> 00:02:06.707]  I train two, three times a day.
[00:02:07.508 --> 00:02:11.809]  They're brutal, agonizing, painful training sessions.
[00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:18.172]  I have to have the edge over my opponents.
[00:02:19.012 --> 00:02:24.094]  I believe that Influoresce products, Super Male Vitality, you know, that gives me the edge.
[00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:27.056]  Well, you have to know where you break.
[00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:30.740]  You know, ultimately, like, you don't push yourself to know where that breaking point is.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.422]  You're always going to be falling short of what your potential is.
[00:02:33.923 --> 00:02:39.609]  So it's really just about finding how far you can go.
[00:02:56.613 --> 00:02:57.874]  There's a lot of different things out there.
[00:02:58.975 --> 00:02:59.916]  I only use the best.
[00:03:02.278 --> 00:03:08.002]  Well, folks, we've got a plethora of news to cover, some highlights from the weekend, a lot of stories from today.
[00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:09.904]  Times are truly crazy.
[00:03:10.284 --> 00:03:20.032]  It's hard enough just trying to figure out everything that's going on, but then to try to tie it all together is one of the serious challenges that we embark on here at InfoWars every day.
[00:03:20.092 --> 00:03:22.394]  So that's what we're going to try to do for you tonight.
[00:03:22.774 --> 00:03:27.698]  Now, you probably heard about the firebombing attack in North Carolina over the weekend.
[00:03:28.018 --> 00:03:34.943]  Governor Pat McCrory said that this was an attack on our democracy, and he could not have said it any better.
[00:03:35.303 --> 00:03:39.066]  And this is what's going on right now, and we're seeing it with the election.
[00:03:39.146 --> 00:03:49.634]  It's been going on for a long time, but people are finally starting to see that there is truly a war with our democracy right now, and it's time for the Republic to stand up.
[00:03:49.694 --> 00:03:50.835]  And we're starting to see that.
[00:03:51.275 --> 00:03:58.939]  Now, Donald Trump, of course, had to go to Twitter, and he blamed animals representing Hillary Clinton and Democrats in North Carolina.
[00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:05.843]  Now, Donald, I don't think we needed you to tweet that out, but we know that Donald likes to fire from the hip.
[00:04:05.903 --> 00:04:07.864]  He has no filter, and he went ahead and said that.
[00:04:08.704 --> 00:04:10.946]  And it turns out he might actually be right.
[00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:13.528]  We'll see what comes up with more WikiLeaks.
[00:04:13.548 --> 00:04:15.910]  We'll see what comes up with more from Project Veritas.
[00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.895]  But we do know that the Democratic Party is responsible for social unrest and promoting violence.
[00:04:22.935 --> 00:04:31.561]  Now Clinton, her campaign tweeted out, the attack on Orange County headquarters in the North Carolina GOP office is horrific and unacceptable.
[00:04:31.762 --> 00:04:33.343]  Very grateful that everyone is safe.
[00:04:33.723 --> 00:04:35.825]  This is a total fraud, folks.
[00:04:36.405 --> 00:04:37.566]  We have caught them.
[00:04:37.786 --> 00:04:39.488]  They love inciting violence.
[00:04:39.548 --> 00:04:41.930]  They want to incite violence at Trump rallies.
[00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.296]  So, nice try Hillary Clinton, but we caught you red-handed thanks to Project Veritas.
[00:04:48.316 --> 00:04:53.420]  Now Dallas Woodhouse, an executive director of the state GOP called the bombing political terrorism.
[00:04:53.781 --> 00:04:56.383]  He said the only thing important to us is that nobody was killed.
[00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:59.586]  And that is something that seriously could have happened here folks.
[00:05:00.006 --> 00:05:03.930]  Do you think that these people who were firebombing the headquarters even thought of that?
[00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:05.492]  I would guess that they didn't.
[00:05:05.512 --> 00:05:06.413]  They're not that bright.
[00:05:06.794 --> 00:05:14.462]  And he said, whether you are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, all Americans should be outraged by this hate-filled and violent attack against our democracy.
[00:05:14.922 --> 00:05:17.806]  I'm not seeing too much outrage on the mainstream media.
[00:05:18.306 --> 00:05:23.490]  Everyone in this country should be free to express their political viewpoints without fear of their own safety.
[00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.435]  But unfortunately, in this election cycle, that's not the case if you like Donald Trump.
[00:05:29.455 --> 00:05:33.678]  A lot of people are afraid to even put a Trump sticker on their car because, well, we've seen what happens.
[00:05:33.758 --> 00:05:35.759]  Windows smashed in, tires slashed.
[00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:36.540]  Now, of course, CNN...
[00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:43.863]  They went ahead and they blamed this firebombing on Donald Trump as if... I mean, this is right out of 1984.
[00:05:43.963 --> 00:05:52.846]  I can't even believe that they would go this low, but CNN host Brian Seltzer did blame, more or less, Donald Trump for this firebombing.
[00:05:52.886 --> 00:05:54.146]  Of course, blaming his rhetoric.
[00:05:54.566 --> 00:05:58.628]  Now, of course, they wrote, Nazis, Nazi Republicans, get out of town or else.
[00:05:59.048 --> 00:06:01.168]  Hillary Clinton is funded by George Soros.
[00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:05.430]  We've actually got more ties with Clinton and Soros coming up tonight in the news.
[00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.771]  And then Stelter goes on, he says, we have no idea who has done this.
[00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:13.192]  We don't know if it's Republicans, Democrats, or a movement.
[00:06:13.812 --> 00:06:14.672]  Give me a break.
[00:06:15.272 --> 00:06:17.293]  We know exactly who did this.
[00:06:17.353 --> 00:06:21.374]  The people that your news outlet is triggering in the public.
[00:06:21.694 --> 00:06:22.554]  That's who did this.
[00:06:22.954 --> 00:06:24.815]  And really, you're going to blame Republicans?
[00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:27.595]  And then do you see how he inserts the word movement in there?
[00:06:27.916 --> 00:06:33.397]  That's also a way of trying to tie Donald Trump and his voters into this firebombing, because this is what
[00:06:33.797 --> 00:06:35.258]  The Trump movement really is.
[00:06:35.378 --> 00:06:40.241]  It is a movement, and Donald Trump has said that, and other people like Senator Sessions have said that.
[00:06:41.542 --> 00:06:44.003]  Now, you may have heard of Max Spears.
[00:06:44.103 --> 00:06:45.064]  You may not have heard of him.
[00:06:45.164 --> 00:06:56.551]  Personally, I had never heard of him, but he was a UFO conspiracy theorist who died under very suspicious circumstances, and the UK has refused to investigate
[00:06:57.031 --> 00:06:57.991]  His death.
[00:06:58.312 --> 00:07:03.754]  UK authorities will not investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of a British conspiracy theorist in Poland.
[00:07:04.234 --> 00:07:11.457]  Now, two days before he died, he was messaging his mother saying he was in trouble and if anything happens to him, investigate.
[00:07:11.917 --> 00:07:18.300]  Friends of his said that he was vomiting black liquid and complaining of migraines for several days.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.901]  So, that's pretty wild.
[00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:28.766]  Again, I'd never heard of this guy before, but you know, usually when they off someone, this does draw light to those individuals.
[00:07:28.826 --> 00:07:41.592]  Now all of a sudden I looked into his work, and we're going to have more on this actually later, but worth mentioning, suspicious death of a UFO conspiracy theorist, and they refuse to investigate.
[00:07:41.672 --> 00:07:45.914]  I don't know why you wouldn't investigate that, but I guess that's none of my business.
[00:07:47.014 --> 00:07:53.520]  Joe Biden, we've done some reports on this, Joe Biden is essentially threatening Russia with cyber warfare.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.404]  This is an unprecedented move for any government to threaten cyber warfare.
[00:07:58.464 --> 00:08:00.566]  But this is what Joe Biden has decided to do.
[00:08:01.487 --> 00:08:11.596]  And he suggested that the Obama administration may launch a retaliatory cyber strike against Russia in response to what Washington believes was interference by Moscow in this election.
[00:08:11.656 --> 00:08:13.238]  So this is actually crazy.
[00:08:13.658 --> 00:08:18.361]  We actually have the proof that the DNC is tampering with elections.
[00:08:18.421 --> 00:08:23.843]  We've caught them red-handed, but here's Joe Biden with no proof, blaming Russia.
[00:08:23.923 --> 00:08:27.465]  And now we'll tie this up in a second, but more on Biden.
[00:08:27.485 --> 00:08:29.126]  He says, we have the capacity to do it.
[00:08:29.566 --> 00:08:33.729]  It will be at the time of our choosing and under circumstances that have the greatest impact.
[00:08:33.989 --> 00:08:37.431]  He is threatening Russia on television.
[00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:46.379]  And we're gonna sit here and wonder if Donald Trump has the right temperament to be president when the vice president is threatening Russia on television?
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:55.067]  And then, I don't know if this guy's very bright, when Biden was asked if the public would ever find out about the nature of the response, he said, hope not.
[00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:55.928]  Really?
[00:08:56.869 --> 00:09:03.812]  You're just talking about it on television, threatening Russia on television, and you're just hoping that this somehow remains secret.
[00:09:04.112 --> 00:09:14.997]  I guess this is him exposing how he feels about the American public, that they're so in the dark, they have no clue what's going on, they're so brainwashed that he can just do it right out in the middle of daylight and get away with it.
[00:09:15.158 --> 00:09:17.559]  Isn't that kind of what's been going on for a while now, though?
[00:09:18.419 --> 00:09:27.529]  And then he said their capacity to fundamentally alter the election is not what people think and I tell you to the extent that they do we will be proportional in what we do.
[00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.575]  Again, threatening Russia and perhaps setting up a false flag.
[00:09:33.336 --> 00:09:36.679]  Now this is something that Russia is responding to.
[00:09:36.819 --> 00:09:39.701]  Primetime host warns of secret plot.
[00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:48.528]  Putin appointed Russian TV host Dmitry Kisilov asserts that the United States could stage a fake provocation to go to war with Russia and Syria.
[00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:53.652]  You look at this, you say, OK, this guy's, you know, he's been appointed by Putin.
[00:09:54.112 --> 00:09:55.273]  How should I trust him?
[00:09:55.853 --> 00:09:58.455]  But he does bring up good points.
[00:09:58.715 --> 00:10:05.179]  And he mentions the Vietnam War, which the United States staged the Gulf of Tonkin to instigate that.
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:11.223]  And he also mentioned how we have invaded Iraq and Libya under false pretenses.
[00:10:11.724 --> 00:10:14.505]  So he does actually make fair points.
[00:10:14.846 --> 00:10:19.469]  And, you know, if you want to play nonpartisan here, you have to take him for what he's saying.
[00:10:20.789 --> 00:10:28.993]  And it's noteworthy because this is a primetime television host in Russia that enjoys the largest audience among news programs in Russia.
[00:10:29.033 --> 00:10:31.574]  So, where is our mainstream media, folks?
[00:10:31.874 --> 00:10:33.595]  What is our TV media talking about?
[00:10:33.855 --> 00:10:41.178]  They're up here warning about false flags, cyber terror, and war, and you know what we're talking about on the mainstream media?
[00:10:41.278 --> 00:10:43.819]  Excuse my French, but we're talking about grabbing pussy.
[00:10:44.139 --> 00:10:48.481]  Okay, so there's the difference between Russia's media and ours.
[00:10:49.122 --> 00:10:50.182]  Take that for what it is.
[00:10:50.782 --> 00:10:54.224]  Now, does this have a link to Joe Biden's threat?
[00:10:54.344 --> 00:10:58.746]  Assange's internet link intentionally severed by state party.
[00:10:58.786 --> 00:11:00.807]  This is actually coming from WikiLeaks.
[00:11:01.588 --> 00:11:03.008]  RT has also wrote a story.
[00:11:03.369 --> 00:11:07.771]  WikiLeaks says it's activated contingency plans after its co-founder
[00:11:08.351 --> 00:11:14.183]  Co-founder's internet service was intentionally cut off by a state actor, the media organization said in a tweet.
[00:11:14.223 --> 00:11:18.953]  So are there any ties to this and John Kerry's threat?
[00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:21.087]  Of cyber warfare.
[00:11:21.207 --> 00:11:23.430]  Is he colluding with Ecuador?
[00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:27.815]  Is he threatening Assange or people who are cooperating with Assange?
[00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:31.198]  We might actually have some evidence of that.
[00:11:31.919 --> 00:11:39.427]  This is a story out of the BBC RT NatWest NatWest to close Russian channels UK bank accounts.
[00:11:40.328 --> 00:11:44.873]  So again, does this have ties to Kerry talking about cyber attacks?
[00:11:45.254 --> 00:11:50.019]  Could this be because RT broadcasts things that these banks don't like?
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:57.668]  Is this kind of a war of politics, geopolitics, economic politics going on here?
[00:11:58.249 --> 00:11:59.590]  The strange thing about it is,
[00:12:00.951 --> 00:12:04.494]  As of right now, RT is still waiting for a reason.
[00:12:05.455 --> 00:12:12.260]  So they just have their bank account shut down and they are yet to even be given a reason for that.
[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.982]  So that is something that is very strange.
[00:12:15.563 --> 00:12:20.086]  Now here's another dynamic difference between the United States government and the Russian government.
[00:12:20.306 --> 00:12:22.388]  This is a story from InfoWars.com.
[00:12:22.428 --> 00:12:26.671]  Kremlin insider, war might begin even before the United States elections.
[00:12:27.612 --> 00:12:29.456]  Urging citizens to stockpile cans of food.
[00:12:29.476 --> 00:12:30.517]  They've been doing this for a while.
[00:12:31.419 --> 00:12:37.570]  And they also just had a drill with millions, I believe, of Russian state actors.
[00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:42.166]  Doing a drill for what they would do in a nuclear war.
[00:12:42.947 --> 00:12:51.871]  But Sergei Markov, a member of the Civic Chamber, a Moscow-based state institution, told the Daily Beast, these are the most serious tensions between Moscow and Washington in decades.
[00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:55.773]  The war might begin before the November elections in the United States.
[00:12:55.813 --> 00:12:58.314]  So, you know, our president is out golfing.
[00:12:58.834 --> 00:13:02.336]  He's smelling his hand as he's going to Hillary Clinton rallies.
[00:13:02.936 --> 00:13:06.838]  And, you know, one of our presidential candidates is going unconscious at 9-11 events.
[00:13:07.938 --> 00:13:11.620]  Here's people coming from inside the Kremlin that are trying to warn people.
[00:13:11.881 --> 00:13:18.345]  He said, I personally plan to stock 200 cans of pork to be ready for a potential war crisis, and I advise everybody to do the same.
[00:13:18.925 --> 00:13:20.766]  Our government is certainly stockpiling.
[00:13:20.806 --> 00:13:31.473]  We know about that, but I don't really hear too much from our media or our government warning that we need to stockpile food, we need to be prepared for a war with Russia.
[00:13:31.573 --> 00:13:32.774]  It's just not
[00:13:33.234 --> 00:13:33.635]  Happening.
[00:13:33.695 --> 00:13:35.937]  So will the mainstream media cover any of that?
[00:13:36.137 --> 00:13:36.738]  I doubt it.
[00:13:36.798 --> 00:13:38.280]  Will the mainstream media cover this?
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:43.606]  1,000 more people shot in Chicago compared with this same time a year ago.
[00:13:43.626 --> 00:13:47.690]  1,000 more people have been shot in Chicago this year compared with the same time last year.
[00:13:48.471 --> 00:13:48.611]  Now...
[00:13:49.471 --> 00:13:51.773]  Will we see Black Lives Matter protests?
[00:13:51.853 --> 00:13:53.594]  Will we see any media covering this?
[00:13:54.155 --> 00:13:54.935]  I don't think so.
[00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:59.418]  But somehow, in a gun-free zone, we see plenty of guns.
[00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:04.182]  I wonder when logic will kick in on that nonsensical legislation.
[00:14:04.482 --> 00:14:08.025]  Now folks, this might be the biggest thing that we are facing.
[00:14:08.065 --> 00:14:14.530]  This might be the biggest thing that we are dealing with, and it appears that Americans are finally starting to wake up to this.
[00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.871]  Poll from Politico
[00:14:16.892 --> 00:14:20.856]  41% of voters say election could be stolen from Donald Trump.
[00:14:20.876 --> 00:14:31.668]  This is a political morning consult poll conducted among almost 2,000 registered voters, October 13th through the 15th, shows that Trump repeated warnings about a rigged election are having effect.
[00:14:31.708 --> 00:14:33.230]  Yeah, it's not just Trump.
[00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:37.235]  We have WikiLeaks, we have Project Veritas, we have dozens
[00:14:37.455 --> 00:14:37.755]  I don't know.
[00:14:56.129 --> 00:14:57.290]  With election fraud.
[00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:02.495]  And it's the Democrats who are sitting here acting like it doesn't exist.
[00:15:02.576 --> 00:15:07.540]  It's a very interesting paradoxical logic to be a Democrat.
[00:15:07.621 --> 00:15:08.662]  I really don't understand.
[00:15:09.282 --> 00:15:10.944]  The public sentiment is beginning to reflect
[00:15:11.184 --> 00:15:12.465]  Trump's campaign message.
[00:15:12.505 --> 00:15:15.208]  Now this is the power of Donald Trump folks.
[00:15:15.268 --> 00:15:27.681]  This has been one of the things for me personally that I've been enjoying with the Donald Trump campaign is that he takes things that we've been trying to get in the mainstream for years and he forces them there.
[00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:32.186]  He forces them into the mainstream and this is just another example.
[00:15:32.627 --> 00:15:33.287]  Now we've got
[00:15:34.128 --> 00:15:38.271]  Again, now states are starting to investigate allegations of voter fraud.
[00:15:38.531 --> 00:15:39.632]  This is happening in Texas.
[00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:45.435]  The Star-Telegram reports allegations of voter fraud in Tarrant County are under investigation by the state.
[00:15:45.936 --> 00:15:56.843]  And of course, you know, we've got DHS and Joe Biden and everybody warning you that it's Russia that wants to hack our elections.
[00:15:56.943 --> 00:15:58.324]  It's Russia we need to be worried about.
[00:15:58.584 --> 00:15:59.905]  Now this is on the heels of another
[00:16:00.345 --> 00:16:02.706]  Report from last week that we covered.
[00:16:02.806 --> 00:16:03.987]  Voter fraud is real.
[00:16:04.347 --> 00:16:05.507]  Here's the real proof.
[00:16:05.887 --> 00:16:09.449]  We covered this and it goes over it how dead people are voting.
[00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:11.250]  Vote harvesting is going on.
[00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:11.750]  Look into that.
[00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:12.830]  That's unbelievable crime.
[00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.952]  So we already know this is going on but they want to try to trick you.
[00:16:16.914 --> 00:16:20.116]  Into thinking that it's Russia, so they can stage World War III with Russia.
[00:16:20.176 --> 00:16:22.017]  Now, here's where it gets really interesting.
[00:16:22.117 --> 00:16:26.499]  Soros board member chairs firm running online voting for Tuesday's Utah caucuses.
[00:16:26.699 --> 00:16:37.825]  This is an older story, but this is George Soros with Lord Mark Mollack Brown using their electronic voting machines for Republican elections.
[00:16:38.405 --> 00:16:41.647]  Now, these are huge Democrat supporters, folks.
[00:16:41.687 --> 00:16:42.608]  Now, this is very important.
[00:16:43.308 --> 00:16:49.317]  Smartmatic, as we can see right here, is one of the biggest systems used for the United States elections.
[00:16:49.897 --> 00:16:52.040]  It has commissions of 307 counties in 16 different states.
[00:16:55.535 --> 00:17:01.138]  In 2006, Smartmatic signed what at the moment was the largest election automation contract in U.S.
[00:17:01.158 --> 00:17:01.518]  history.
[00:17:01.919 --> 00:17:02.559]  Now look at this.
[00:17:02.879 --> 00:17:05.821]  You want to tell me that these election machines are going to be fair?
[00:17:06.621 --> 00:17:11.264]  Mark Millock Brown is a former member of two in the United Nations.
[00:17:11.304 --> 00:17:13.465]  I'm sorry, he's a former number two in the United Nations.
[00:17:13.845 --> 00:17:14.386]  He's also
[00:17:15.026 --> 00:17:15.607]  We're good to go.
[00:17:35.868 --> 00:17:39.712]  Which runs the United States elections, has close ties with George Soros.
[00:17:39.752 --> 00:17:41.954]  George Soros has close ties with Hillary Clinton.
[00:17:42.314 --> 00:17:45.557]  We can see that George Soros is one of the biggest donors of the Clinton campaign.
[00:17:45.817 --> 00:17:46.898]  We have the WikiLeaks.
[00:17:47.198 --> 00:17:49.080]  She has a tight relation with Soros.
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.541]  She even goes to dinner with him.
[00:17:51.422 --> 00:17:52.784]  That just reeks of corruption.
[00:17:52.844 --> 00:17:57.508]  Anybody who's not concerned about electronic rigged voting machines is sleeping under a rock.
[00:17:57.748 --> 00:17:58.809]  Now what's up with Bernie?
[00:17:59.089 --> 00:18:02.210]  Bernie is still campaigning for Clinton.
[00:18:02.571 --> 00:18:03.491]  I really don't understand this.
[00:18:03.551 --> 00:18:04.932]  Are his supporters still buying this?
[00:18:04.992 --> 00:18:08.874]  This could be a big thing that could swing the election, where Bernie supporters go.
[00:18:08.954 --> 00:18:11.395]  But he really has made himself look like quite the fool.
[00:18:11.755 --> 00:18:12.636]  Now here's something.
[00:18:13.536 --> 00:18:17.618]  Over 4,500 redaction in Hillary FBI documents.
[00:18:17.699 --> 00:18:19.620]  Folks, this is absurd.
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.121]  The FBI claims it's trying to be transparent.
[00:18:22.541 --> 00:18:25.523]  You go and you look at these redactions.
[00:18:27.153 --> 00:18:29.995]  Go ahead and look at these redactions please for me real quick.
[00:18:30.335 --> 00:18:32.056]  Some of them are whole pages!
[00:18:32.656 --> 00:18:34.838]  Some of them are whole pages redacted.
[00:18:34.938 --> 00:18:36.139]  It is absolutely absurd.
[00:18:36.399 --> 00:18:42.923]  But even the stuff that's not redacted, we can see how people that Clinton has worked with do not like her at all.
[00:18:42.983 --> 00:18:44.023]  She's not fun to work with.
[00:18:44.264 --> 00:18:48.646]  Scientists are now creating eggs in a lab from scratch and producing healthy offspring.
[00:18:48.686 --> 00:18:50.047]  Humans growing in petri dishes.
[00:18:50.467 --> 00:18:51.308]  It's unbelievable.
[00:18:51.728 --> 00:18:54.350]  We'll be right back with more on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:23:03.419 --> 00:23:17.652]  As Americans turn the corner towards the final presidential debate on Wednesday, the election circus has devolved into personal attacks and character assassination rather than any real focus on the issues plaguing the United States.
[00:23:18.132 --> 00:23:22.536]  The media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts.
[00:23:23.177 --> 00:23:31.821]  Because even a simple investigation would have shown that these were nothing more than false smears.
[00:23:32.401 --> 00:23:38.764]  Facing an avalanche of new accusations from women who are coming forward to claim he kissed and fondled them.
[00:23:39.384 --> 00:23:46.547]  Six women are going public today with stories that echo what Trump himself said in that notorious hot mic video.
[00:23:46.847 --> 00:23:48.948]  He called this woman Miss Piggy.
[00:23:48.968 --> 00:23:50.969]  Her name is Alicia- Where did you find this?
[00:23:51.089 --> 00:23:51.770]  Machado.
[00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.672]  Trump spoke out about those claims on Fox News.
[00:24:02.004 --> 00:24:03.966]  And it was a real problem.
[00:24:04.086 --> 00:24:26.646]  Regardless of the fact that Obama's unconstitutional open border policy is quietly responsible for killing as many as 7,500 Americans every year, 20 on average per day, due to the hordes of illegal drivers flooding the roads, while Obama creates a pilot program to have Americans pay for Syrian refugees to come to the United States and move into our homes.
[00:24:27.006 --> 00:24:53.196]  Regardless of the fact that food stamp participation has increased by 78% over the past 10 years, regardless of the fact that Obama and Hillary's new Cold War rhetoric amplified by a suicidal mainstream media has obliterated any shred of integrity 6% of Americans still think cable-fed propaganda media has, after polls revealed America is almost completely done with the mainstream media.
[00:24:53.356 --> 00:25:00.940]  He doesn't have the temperament, he doesn't have the knowledge, he doesn't seem to have the interest in acquiring the knowledge or the basic honesty that a president needs to have.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.101]  And that was true before we heard him.
[00:25:22.765 --> 00:25:25.728]  Talking about how he treats women.
[00:25:27.069 --> 00:25:29.050]  This is not something that we can ignore.
[00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:36.457]  It's not something we can just sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season.
[00:25:37.605 --> 00:25:43.447]  Well, we've been learning quite a lot from the treasure trove of information dumped by WikiLeaks.
[00:25:43.847 --> 00:25:50.130]  Something of particular interest, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager John Podesta is obsessed with aliens.
[00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.971]  Oh, and we are the conspiracy theorists.
[00:25:53.431 --> 00:26:04.161]  Now, investigative journalist Wayne Madsen has a really great article up at InfoWars.com saying it's actually UFO hunters, not the Russians, who've hacked Podesta, and they hacked John Podesta.
[00:26:04.201 --> 00:26:07.303]  He was targeted for what he knows about ETs.
[00:26:07.604 --> 00:26:15.291]  Now, this might sound sensational, but this article really breaks it down, gets into kind of the history of Wikileaks, all these hacker collectives,
[00:26:15.891 --> 00:26:20.837]  Madsen points out that the main quest of computer hackers would be for the holy grail of U.S.
[00:26:20.897 --> 00:26:21.918]  government data files.
[00:26:22.258 --> 00:26:24.781]  They're popularly known as the X-Files.
[00:26:25.282 --> 00:26:34.893]  Now, our journalist Wayne Madsen joins me now to break down this story, get into these outrageous emails, and why you say it's not a song to the Russians.
[00:26:36.035 --> 00:26:41.122]  Julian Assange to me has always been a hacker, and will always be a hacker.
[00:26:41.542 --> 00:26:49.873]  He was very active in hacking internationally in various computer systems and networks in the late 60s and early 90s.
[00:26:51.115 --> 00:26:58.498]  In the early 90s, we had the advent of the quite popular television show, The X-Files.
[00:26:59.319 --> 00:27:04.101]  And if people recall, there was a spin-off to that show called The Lone Gunman.
[00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:07.623]  And in The Lone Gunman were four computer hackers.
[00:27:07.983 --> 00:27:12.245]  Look, Chris Carter, the guy that came out with The X-Files, didn't just dream that up.
[00:27:12.305 --> 00:27:18.228]  Because in those early days, and this is going back to pre-World Wide Web,
[00:27:19.188 --> 00:27:28.875]  This is when people would access bulletin board systems and systems via CompuServe, Prodigy, and America Online.
[00:27:29.495 --> 00:27:38.642]  And this is when Assange and his fellow cypherpunks were very active in trying to break in to various government computer systems.
[00:27:39.302 --> 00:27:47.688]  And in those days, the Holy Grail, as I call it, was anything you could possibly get on UFOs.
[00:27:48.268 --> 00:27:56.443]  You know, Roswell, Area 51, and that has never died among the hacker community.
[00:27:57.025 --> 00:28:00.531]  And now with the web being the way it is, and Hillary really
[00:28:01.776 --> 00:28:12.045]  You know, she sounded the dog whistle on a talk show where she said, yes, she's in favor of as much disclosure as possible.
[00:28:12.466 --> 00:28:15.809]  Her husband, Bill Clinton, said essentially the same thing.
[00:28:16.209 --> 00:28:25.558]  Well, this attracts every hacker in the world, people like this fellow McKinnon, who was indicted a few years back by the United States, a Scottish
[00:28:26.318 --> 00:28:34.243]  A hacker said he was hacking into government computer systems in the United States looking for information on UFO.
[00:28:34.763 --> 00:28:36.284]  He's not the only one.
[00:28:36.344 --> 00:28:38.185]  There's many like him.
[00:28:38.745 --> 00:28:44.188]  And when I saw this, blaming the Russians for this, it's so ludicrous.
[00:28:44.228 --> 00:28:53.994]  First of all, the Russian intelligence service isn't going to leave digital breadcrumbs to lead them back to SVR or FSB headquarters in Moscow.
[00:28:54.934 --> 00:29:12.442]  And never ascribe to Russian intelligence what can be more easily ascribed to computer hackers looking for information about what Podesta knows, what Hillary knows, what Bill Clinton knows, because they have certainly said this is a major interest of theirs.
[00:29:12.887 --> 00:29:16.389]  Right, because of course John Podesta was Chief of Staff for Bill Clinton.
[00:29:16.609 --> 00:29:19.690]  They are now Chairman of Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[00:29:20.171 --> 00:29:24.112]  But let's take a look at some of the emails that are actually very interesting.
[00:29:24.153 --> 00:29:28.875]  Now a lot has been reported about Tom DeLonge, who is the former lead singer of Blink-182.
[00:29:29.515 --> 00:29:33.317]  And he was, for some reason, emailing John Podesta.
[00:29:33.357 --> 00:29:34.838]  They were doing a documentary.
[00:29:35.158 --> 00:29:38.539]  So obviously there's something that's going to be forthcoming with that part of the disclosure project.
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.361]  But one of the emails that I thought was really interesting
[00:29:41.781 --> 00:29:43.762]  Was from Edgar D. Mitchell.
[00:29:44.142 --> 00:29:47.843]  He's an Apollo 14 astronaut, six man to walk on the moon.
[00:29:49.144 --> 00:29:55.466]  He is saying, you know, John, I'd love to just have a little bit of your time to meet to discuss disclosure and zero point energy.
[00:29:56.006 --> 00:30:03.689]  We can talk to my Catholic colleague, Terry Mansfield, to bring us up to date on the Vatican's awareness of extraterrestrial intelligence.
[00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:09.137]  Another colleague is working on a new space treaty, citing involvement with Russia and China.
[00:30:09.457 --> 00:30:13.403]  They're pursuing a route for peace in space and zero-point energy on Earth.
[00:30:13.764 --> 00:30:19.032]  And there's another one where they're talking about this war in space race where he says, remember,
[00:30:19.372 --> 00:30:25.198]  Our non-violent ETI from the contiguous universe are helping us bring zero-point energy to Earth.
[00:30:25.599 --> 00:30:30.304]  They will not tolerate any forms of military violence on Earth or in space.
[00:30:30.724 --> 00:30:38.372]  And then goes on to talk about Carol and I have been working on the treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space attached for your convenience.
[00:30:39.333 --> 00:30:39.974]  What?
[00:30:40.735 --> 00:30:51.267]  So, obviously, here with John Podesta, we have Apollo 14 astronauts saying, look, let's talk about our non-violent extraterrestrial intelligence out there that's helping us.
[00:30:51.667 --> 00:30:56.853]  So I think it's, this is, they've kind of found what they were looking for, these hackers.
[00:30:58.195 --> 00:31:00.817]  And as I say, they've been looking at it for a long time.
[00:31:01.278 --> 00:31:08.685]  And I have to point out, I know John Podesta from years back when I was involved in computer security issues.
[00:31:09.046 --> 00:31:13.150]  He used to be the chief lobbyist for a group called the Electronic Mail Association.
[00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:19.072]  Formed in the 1980s, trying to get people to use email rather than the normal U.S.
[00:31:19.132 --> 00:31:20.013]  Postal Service.
[00:31:20.673 --> 00:31:32.338]  And of course, he was very cognizant at the time of the hacker threat, even then, even back to the days of CompuServe and Prodigy and Lotus Notes.
[00:31:32.858 --> 00:31:33.138]  I think so.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:32:03.630]  To suggest it was the Russians that were behind it, and he's obviously convinced Hillary of that, and Obama, and these ne'er-do-wells that head up our intelligence services, like James Clapper, who has no clue as to what's going on, in my opinion.
[00:32:04.971 --> 00:32:10.135]  Well, I mean, I think they owe an apology to the Russian government, and while they're at it,
[00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:21.141]  With all this belief in intergalactic or interstellar treaties, they probably should apologize to that alien hair guy on the History Channel while they're at it.
[00:32:21.441 --> 00:32:22.542]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:32:22.622 --> 00:32:35.869]  And of course, you know, they point out here in the Podesta email that Russia's actions in the Ukraine is what they're kind of wanting to cut them out of this space peace treaty deal because the Russians were kind of doing their own thing.
[00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:37.590]  So it's really incredibly interesting.
[00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:41.053]  So I encourage everyone to go to InfoWars.com, read this article.
[00:32:41.113 --> 00:32:42.814]  It gets into great detail.
[00:32:42.835 --> 00:32:48.119]  I mean, it's six pages long with all of the hacker collectives and their ties to the KGB, everything.
[00:32:48.179 --> 00:32:52.403]  It's report UFO hunters, not Russians, hacked Podesta.
[00:32:53.004 --> 00:32:55.866]  Wayne Madsen, thank you so much for joining us and we'll be speaking with you soon.
[00:32:56.607 --> 00:32:57.208]  Good to be with you.

[00:34:04.926 --> 00:34:09.888]  Now another shirt that was designed and licensed from Roger Stone is the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[00:34:10.548 --> 00:34:13.229]  Looks like the, you know, communist style Obama Hope shirt.
[00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:19.932]  But says, rape, wear it, get aggressive, start the conversations, get on TV with it.
[00:34:19.952 --> 00:34:20.973]  In fact, I'm going to say this right now.
[00:34:21.393 --> 00:34:31.577]  Anyone that gets on national TV with the shirt, clearly, for more than five seconds, gets a thousand dollars.
[00:34:33.183 --> 00:34:34.784]  That means, you know, behind cameras, you name it.
[00:34:34.945 --> 00:34:45.894]  Anyone that gets it on air on national TV and gets the words out, Bill Clinton is a rapist, or things along that line with a bullhorn, I could go to this right now. $5,000.
[00:34:49.884 --> 00:34:52.287]  Until a budget of $100,000 has been spent.
[00:34:52.668 --> 00:34:54.150]  Adoptable dogs.
[00:34:54.250 --> 00:35:00.799]  Every year, the Best Friends Animal Society helps cats and dogs who are stuck in animal shelters find homes.
[00:35:05.686 --> 00:35:11.252]  I think one of the things that we really need to be looking at in this debate is that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:35:11.413 --> 00:35:12.374]  Infowars.com.
[00:35:12.474 --> 00:35:13.395]  Infowars.com.
[00:35:13.555 --> 00:35:14.436]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:35:14.776 --> 00:35:15.818]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:35:16.038 --> 00:35:16.258]  Alright.
[00:35:16.278 --> 00:35:17.199]  Bill Clinton.
[00:35:17.219 --> 00:35:23.927]  I got this Hillary for Prison t-shirt and I just want everyone to know about this big presidential campaign that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:35:24.047 --> 00:35:24.788]  Infowars.com.
[00:35:25.743 --> 00:35:26.123]  Okay.
[00:35:26.263 --> 00:35:27.604]  Thank you very much, Terrence.
[00:35:27.964 --> 00:35:29.585]  He doesn't age.
[00:35:29.805 --> 00:35:30.725]  No, he doesn't.
[00:35:30.765 --> 00:35:32.106]  He looks great.
[00:35:32.146 --> 00:35:33.907]  We're all gonna rickroll.
[00:35:34.187 --> 00:35:34.787]  Exactly.
[00:35:34.867 --> 00:35:37.929]  We've had a $100,000 contest before.
[00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.591]  My budget's $100,000.
[00:35:42.731 --> 00:35:46.293]  That means if a bunch of people do this, I'll pay up to $100,000 and stop it.
[00:35:56.971 --> 00:36:01.394]  That's $1,000 if you just get the shirt on national TV.
[00:36:03.135 --> 00:36:04.276]  Visually, rape.
[00:36:05.477 --> 00:36:05.757]  Okay?
[00:36:06.837 --> 00:36:07.218]  It is.
[00:36:08.493 --> 00:36:11.916]  It is $5,000 if you get the audio.
[00:36:11.956 --> 00:36:12.556]  Legally and lawfully.
[00:36:12.576 --> 00:36:21.983]  They've got to be outdoors, on their little bench, you've got to have a bullhorn, you've got to have the shirt on or have somebody with it, or maybe a big sign with it on it, and two of you hold it up, and then somebody else bullhorns.
[00:36:22.383 --> 00:36:25.545]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, not a philanderer.
[00:36:26.126 --> 00:36:27.567]  Hillary covers up the rape.
[00:36:32.478 --> 00:36:35.140]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.402]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:36:38.422 --> 00:36:39.523]  Because it's already here.
[00:36:39.923 --> 00:36:40.584]  It's being announced.
[00:36:40.924 --> 00:36:44.386]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:36:44.806 --> 00:36:46.708]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:36:46.868 --> 00:36:48.409]  A new battleship in the fight.
[00:36:48.609 --> 00:36:49.610]  InfoWars Live.
[00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:50.610]  Available right now.
[00:36:50.891 --> 00:36:52.252]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[00:36:52.692 --> 00:36:55.073]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[00:36:55.794 --> 00:36:56.695]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[00:36:57.255 --> 00:37:00.257]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:37:00.757 --> 00:37:01.338]  Take action!
[00:37:07.556 --> 00:37:13.999]  We have seen unprecedented bias against Donald Trump and his supporters in the last year and a half during this campaign.
[00:37:14.819 --> 00:37:24.042]  But on the issue of the Clinton Foundation stealing close to two billion dollars of Haitian aid relief, even the Washington Post, the New York Times have admitted they did it.
[00:37:24.442 --> 00:37:26.583]  But they say it was a mistake or they screwed up.
[00:37:26.623 --> 00:37:31.745]  We've got Chelsea's emails her credit saying, thousands are dying mom and dad we got to give them the money.
[00:37:33.415 --> 00:37:37.518]  97 plus percent of the money they were given never got there.
[00:37:37.978 --> 00:37:44.762]  The Clintons only have about 3% to 5%, depending on the year, of the money they raise to charity as well.
[00:37:45.563 --> 00:37:47.484]  This is truly monstrous.
[00:37:47.604 --> 00:37:49.565]  It is so diabolical.
[00:37:50.826 --> 00:37:58.091]  So after the hurricane hit over a week ago, I began to talk to the crew about trying to get into Haiti, but no commercial aircraft were going in.
[00:37:58.811 --> 00:38:00.172]  And then out of the blue, Gary Haven,
[00:38:01.308 --> 00:38:07.472]  Billionaire, patriot, friend of the show, called me about a week ago and he said, you know, I fly aid missions in every week.
[00:38:08.313 --> 00:38:11.875]  And I've been doing it since the earthquake hit five years ago.
[00:38:11.895 --> 00:38:13.736]  And he said, would you like to come with your crew?
[00:38:13.776 --> 00:38:15.177]  And I said, absolutely.
[00:38:15.377 --> 00:38:16.698]  We were just trying to get a crew in there.
[00:38:16.979 --> 00:38:17.759]  I hadn't thought of you.
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.881]  And Gary got them into the country for five days.
[00:38:21.041 --> 00:38:24.484]  And I've been watching since they got back last night, hours of this footage.
[00:38:24.584 --> 00:38:25.604]  And it's so staggering.
[00:38:25.965 --> 00:38:26.825]  It's so haunting.
[00:38:29.724 --> 00:38:33.866]  I don't even feel worthy to try to bring this info out to try to help these people.
[00:38:34.887 --> 00:38:37.268]  I mean, they've got footage of people dying.
[00:38:37.549 --> 00:38:44.313]  The UN there letting children die and not even fly them 30 minutes to the capital of Haiti.
[00:38:45.173 --> 00:38:50.676]  I've got private planes coming in with food that basically the UN takes control of.
[00:38:50.937 --> 00:38:56.480]  I have got footage of the public almost rioting when they hear.
[00:38:57.591 --> 00:39:06.566]  The name Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton because they know they represented Haiti for several years and took the money from good Americans and others that gave it.
[00:39:07.659 --> 00:39:09.380]  We are going through hours of footage.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:14.723]  I've got Gary Haven, the pilot, on tomorrow with our crew that was there, Joe Biggs and Michael Zimmerman.
[00:39:15.164 --> 00:39:17.165]  Here's just a few clips of what's coming up.
[00:39:18.346 --> 00:39:29.553]  Just to grasp the true horror of this and the loss of humanity and 10,000 people dying of cholera and other diseases because the UN used the water supply that was set up
[00:39:30.472 --> 00:39:32.893]  That's why I'm asking all of you to share this video
[00:39:51.724 --> 00:39:51.984]  Thank you.
[00:40:11.912 --> 00:40:19.697]  We're also going to be going over some charities that are known to give over 90% of the money to the Haitians and others, unlike the Clintons who keep over 90%.
[00:40:20.017 --> 00:40:21.818]  So join us tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[00:40:21.838 --> 00:40:22.438]  to 3 p.m.
[00:40:22.719 --> 00:40:24.700]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:40:29.909 --> 00:40:38.616]  Hillary Clinton loves to point out how much of a totalitarian Vladimir Putin is, axing journalists who dare expose government corruption there in Russia.
[00:40:39.056 --> 00:40:42.639]  But let's take a look at what we can expect from a Hillary Clinton dictatorship.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.762]  She is already at war with the First Amendment.
[00:40:45.822 --> 00:40:49.945]  She's made it abundantly clear that she is going after any of the media that she can't control.
[00:40:50.426 --> 00:40:57.992]  Most recently, her campaign website features a hit piece on the dark heart Alex Jones, who of course she name-dropped
[00:40:58.192 --> 00:41:04.521]  I will not let you down.
[00:41:04.541 --> 00:41:07.626]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:41:08.167 --> 00:41:09.508]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:41:11.792 --> 00:41:19.234]  Sandy Hook is a synthetic, completely fake, with actors, in my view, manufactured.
[00:41:19.434 --> 00:41:20.794]  I will not let you down.
[00:41:20.934 --> 00:41:24.756]  The official story is a fable and an inside job is the only explanation.
[00:41:25.076 --> 00:41:27.956]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:41:28.056 --> 00:41:29.097]  They're the ones running ISIS.
[00:41:29.117 --> 00:41:34.658]  I mean, I've interviewed the cops and the people that saw the feds planting the bombs on Oklahoma City.
[00:41:34.818 --> 00:41:35.999]  I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:41:36.019 --> 00:41:37.079]  I think she's going to show up.
[00:41:38.099 --> 00:41:39.800]  And, uh, on drugs, though.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.660]  She's gonna be blacked out.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.261]  I will not let you down.
[00:41:42.961 --> 00:41:45.402]  She's a frickin' demon, and she stinks, and so does Obama.
[00:41:45.422 --> 00:41:46.122]  And I go, like, what?
[00:41:46.302 --> 00:41:46.682]  Sulfur.
[00:41:47.083 --> 00:41:52.445]  I have the government documents where they said they're gonna encourage homosexuality with chemicals so that people don't have children.
[00:41:52.725 --> 00:41:56.866]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:41:59.407 --> 00:42:00.988]  And I'll tell ya, it is surreal.
[00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:07.759]  To talk about issues here on air and then word for word hear Trump say it two days later.
[00:42:09.242 --> 00:42:10.264]  It is amazing.
[00:42:13.058 --> 00:42:20.842]  And new WikiLeaks emails reveal that she did absolutely nothing to lift the UK travel ban on talk show host Michael Savage.
[00:42:21.203 --> 00:42:26.045]  Now, Savage had his travel banned to the UK by the government's top homeland security official in 2009.
[00:42:26.285 --> 00:42:30.388]  This is along with terrorists and neo-Nazi murderers.
[00:42:30.788 --> 00:42:34.130]  The pretext being that his views might provoke violence.
[00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:42.693]  Now as an American citizen, Savage appealed directly to Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State to help him defend his First Amendment rights.
[00:42:43.033 --> 00:42:51.037]  But now we see with these new emails that Hillary Clinton herself said to her aides, let's hold on doing anything until we all talk.
[00:42:51.437 --> 00:42:53.337]  Apparently they didn't want to come off as hypocritical.
[00:42:53.878 --> 00:43:00.640]  Cheryl Mills points out that the same ban imposed by the UK on Savage could happen in the US under current law.
[00:43:01.021 --> 00:43:04.502]  So this is coming from a woman who could be president and her top
[00:43:04.582 --> 00:43:05.022]  We're good to go.
[00:43:32.557 --> 00:43:32.637]  Yes.
[00:43:53.311 --> 00:43:53.691]  We're good to go.
[00:44:12.338 --> 00:44:29.309]  Now we know that the establishment media is totally bought and paid for, controlled by the Clinton campaign, so they're absolutely not going to be covering these WikiLeaks releases, which is one of the reasons why Alex Jones is in her crosshairs, because InfoWars is putting out the truth that they don't want you to see.
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:39.029]  CNN actually came out and said that it is illegal for anyone but CNN to look into the WikiLeaks emails.
[00:44:39.569 --> 00:44:40.110]  It isn't.
[00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:47.317]  But we should all be shaken to the core that the establishment corporate media is trying to push out this narrative that only they
[00:44:47.637 --> 00:44:49.858]  Should be able to have access to information.
[00:44:49.898 --> 00:44:53.861]  They're actively trying to control your access to the truth.
[00:44:53.901 --> 00:44:58.564]  They don't think that you're smart enough to be able to sift through all of the information that's out there.
[00:44:58.884 --> 00:45:09.490]  Because let's not forget, just last week, President Obama said that there needs to be some sort of a news curator to filter out the truth, make it easier for people to get the truth.
[00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:13.513]  So of course, this is the truth according to those in power.
[00:45:14.173 --> 00:45:19.115]  Okay, I think most people are relatively intelligent enough to be able to sift through the massive data that's out there.
[00:45:19.596 --> 00:45:32.642]  Google immediately releases their fact-check filter, so this is going to be great for people with zero critical thinking skills, and this is the dumbed-down, compliant citizenry of despotic dreams.
[00:45:32.902 --> 00:45:40.566]  And what we know from these WikiLeaks emails at the Democratic Party, that's the kind of people that they're hoping to raise, is this compliant citizenry.
[00:45:41.431 --> 00:45:46.054]  So people need to understand that control of the news media is instrumental.
[00:45:46.294 --> 00:45:49.256]  It is a key feature of a totalitarian government.
[00:45:49.616 --> 00:46:00.202]  And one of the reasons why the United States has worked for so long with relative freedom is because of the First Amendment and freedom of speech and the protections of freedom of the press.
[00:46:00.622 --> 00:46:06.866]  And right now we are witnessing a very slippery slope of authoritarianism creeping into our country.
[00:46:07.466 --> 00:46:23.722]  In fact, we have some people out there in the media actively celebrating the fact that Hillary Clinton has come out saying that she is going to treat the First Amendment and independent journalists with the same dictatorial powers that she claims to despise in Vladimir Putin.
[00:46:38.131 --> 00:46:38.952]  Come on, Hillary.
[00:46:39.152 --> 00:46:39.733]  Just a little.
[00:46:40.033 --> 00:46:40.814]  Just a little sip.
[00:46:41.375 --> 00:46:41.675]  Open up.
[00:46:41.996 --> 00:46:42.877]  Come on, take it!
[00:46:43.378 --> 00:46:43.758]  Take it!
[00:46:44.058 --> 00:46:45.120]  I'm running for president.
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.704]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[00:46:48.985 --> 00:46:53.110]  I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.244 --> 00:48:52.725]  I don't know.
[00:49:07.591 --> 00:49:09.693]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:49:09.773 --> 00:49:10.674]  Owen Troyer with you.
[00:49:10.754 --> 00:49:13.417]  I'm about to be joined by Leanne McAdoo and Margaret Howe.
[00:49:13.837 --> 00:49:25.249]  Project Veritas has just released a scathing, well, one video in a series of videos, but truly unbelievable investigative reporting from James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[00:49:25.649 --> 00:49:28.452]  Here are some of the highlights from the first video release.
[00:49:29.232 --> 00:49:34.395]  If you're there, and you're protesting, and you do these actions, you will be attacked at Trump rallies.
[00:49:34.476 --> 00:49:35.336]  That's what we want.
[00:49:35.356 --> 00:49:37.077]  People will freak the f*** out.
[00:49:37.478 --> 00:49:40.720]  The security team will freak out, and his supporters will lose their s***.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:44.342]  We are contracted directly with the DNC and the campaign.
[00:49:44.382 --> 00:49:44.522]  Vote.
[00:49:45.863 --> 00:49:48.804]  There's a script.
[00:49:48.884 --> 00:49:52.224]  Oh, there is a script.
[00:49:52.824 --> 00:49:53.965]  There's a script.
[00:49:54.265 --> 00:49:54.465]  Okay.
[00:49:54.665 --> 00:49:55.885]  There's a script of engagement.
[00:49:56.365 --> 00:49:59.406]  Sometimes the crazies bite, and sometimes the crazies don't bite.
[00:49:59.726 --> 00:50:01.926]  They're starting confrontations in the line.
[00:50:01.946 --> 00:50:02.366]  Mm-hmm.
[00:50:02.386 --> 00:50:02.966]  Mm-hmm.
[00:50:03.047 --> 00:50:03.467]  Right?
[00:50:03.507 --> 00:50:05.667]  They're not starting confrontations in the rally.
[00:50:05.707 --> 00:50:06.267]  To volunteers.
[00:50:06.287 --> 00:50:09.488]  Because once they're inside the rally, they're under Secret Service's control.
[00:50:10.028 --> 00:50:12.288]  When they're outside the rally, they're more affected out.
[00:50:13.229 --> 00:50:14.529]  They're harder to get in.
[00:50:16.022 --> 00:50:18.428]  I assume it's always in the rally.
[00:50:24.767 --> 00:50:29.649]  By having leading conversations with people who are naturally psychotic.
[00:50:29.989 --> 00:50:34.191]  You can message to draw them out and draw them to punch you.
[00:50:34.551 --> 00:50:43.895]  To go wherever these events are, which means we have to have a central kind of agitator training.
[00:50:43.955 --> 00:50:44.176]  Yep.
[00:50:44.516 --> 00:50:46.036]  Nobody's really supposed to know about me.
[00:50:47.497 --> 00:50:51.599]  So the Chicago protest, when they shot all that, that was us.
[00:50:58.971 --> 00:51:01.052]  I don't want it to come from the party.
[00:51:18.863 --> 00:51:27.208]  Well, Leanne, Margaret, perhaps just as scathing as the WikiLeaks releases, these videos are pretty damaging to the Democratic Party.
[00:51:27.348 --> 00:51:27.549]  Right.
[00:51:27.689 --> 00:51:29.590]  There is no end to the villainy.
[00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:39.756]  And, you know, months back when we first started exposing this and talking about how they were busing in these protesters, they were being paid to go off at the Trump rallies to make the Trump supporters look bad.
[00:51:42.338 --> 00:51:44.139]  We were actually vilified.
[00:51:44.159 --> 00:51:50.624]  I know The Intercept, for one, ran a hit piece on us saying, how dare you push out this meme that there's these paid protesters.
[00:51:51.045 --> 00:51:52.085]  That's a total lie.
[00:51:52.606 --> 00:51:56.449]  And indeed, now, here comes Project Veritas with a slam dunk.
[00:51:57.793 --> 00:51:58.013]  Margaret?
[00:51:58.033 --> 00:52:00.214]  Did you hear what he said about plausible deniability?
[00:52:00.234 --> 00:52:01.354]  They don't want any of this LinkedIn.
[00:52:01.394 --> 00:52:02.214]  It's so obvious.
[00:52:02.614 --> 00:52:09.936]  The problem that I'm having, Owen, so we know last Friday, for example, that Trump tape leak, it was covered 23 times by all three major networks.
[00:52:10.316 --> 00:52:14.637]  The WikiLeaks revelations that are all bombshells got one total minute.
[00:52:14.717 --> 00:52:18.017]  So people really have to be watching this because of course it's going on.
[00:52:18.297 --> 00:52:22.778]  And oh, by the way, throughout that tape, at one point they asked, does Hillary know about this?
[00:52:22.838 --> 00:52:23.659]  What does she know about?
[00:52:24.019 --> 00:52:25.399]  She knows about all of it.
[00:52:26.039 --> 00:52:26.520]  All of it.
[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:27.821]  She knows this is going on.
[00:52:27.881 --> 00:52:29.123]  It's going on on her behalf.
[00:52:29.263 --> 00:52:32.406]  And they just want to give that little line of plausible deniability.
[00:52:32.787 --> 00:52:35.409]  And this is a 16-plus minute long piece.
[00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:37.972]  This is just the first part in a multi-part series.
[00:52:38.313 --> 00:52:41.116]  So there's more stuff that's going to come out if you can even believe it.
[00:52:41.687 --> 00:52:48.052]  Well, and whatever plausibility or deniability they thought they had, that's pretty much over with now.
[00:52:48.213 --> 00:52:56.520]  I mean, with this video, they are admitting what they've done at these protests or at these Trump rallies to agitate people.
[00:52:57.020 --> 00:53:02.062]  And it's exactly what we saw the mainstream media say that Trump supporters were doing.
[00:53:02.102 --> 00:53:05.643]  No, it's actually the Democratic people and the people they're funding to put out there.
[00:53:06.264 --> 00:53:08.485]  And, you know, there's so much about this.
[00:53:08.525 --> 00:53:10.765]  Like you said, there's only this is one video in the whole series.
[00:53:11.366 --> 00:53:16.328]  And something that James O'Keefe said is we will the mainstream media cover this?
[00:53:16.868 --> 00:53:18.709]  Will the mainstream media address this at all?
[00:53:18.749 --> 00:53:20.069]  You just talked about the Trump tapes.
[00:53:20.109 --> 00:53:21.650]  They wanted to cover that all day long.
[00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:24.991]  Do you expect any coverage from the mainstream media on this?
[00:53:25.191 --> 00:53:30.775]  No, and well, that's the exact same thing Julian Assange said, is that whatever he's going to drop, it's going to be bombshell.
[00:53:30.815 --> 00:53:34.718]  It could devastate the Democratic Party if the media picks it up.
[00:53:35.058 --> 00:53:36.579]  And that was his key point that he made.
[00:53:36.599 --> 00:53:41.623]  And so this is, again, happening with James O'Keefe and his amazing work.
[00:53:41.643 --> 00:53:50.569]  He actually tweeted out a little earlier, there was a video of a corgi trying to get up the stairs and they're looping this video of a corgi fighting against this.
[00:53:50.669 --> 00:53:54.312]  That was what the media is showing you, not James O'Keefe's.
[00:53:55.032 --> 00:53:56.033]  Bombshell video.
[00:53:56.093 --> 00:53:59.014]  I want to point out that we have been covering this for weeks and weeks.
[00:53:59.054 --> 00:54:00.715]  So yes, we knew that this was going on.
[00:54:00.815 --> 00:54:07.759]  Alex has been talking about this for weeks and specifically related to the Charlotte protesters that literally burned down the city of Charlotte.
[00:54:07.799 --> 00:54:14.502]  We knew the police on the ground, they said that over 60 or 70 percent of the people coming in, they're holding out-of-state licenses.
[00:54:14.522 --> 00:54:16.323]  They're being bused in from other places.
[00:54:16.363 --> 00:54:19.325]  These are orchestrated protests that are being paid to agitate
[00:54:19.705 --> 00:54:19.885]  Thank you.
[00:54:36.547 --> 00:54:37.988]  Well I'm not sure if we'll ever find out.
[00:54:38.148 --> 00:54:44.432]  Maybe perhaps there'll be some information on that in the next video that Project Veritas releases.
[00:54:44.512 --> 00:54:54.478]  But if we have any indication of the question I posed to you, will the mainstream media cover this, Fox News has already cancelled interviews with James O'Keefe.
[00:54:54.498 --> 00:54:56.819]  This is pretty unprecedented.
[00:54:56.899 --> 00:55:00.141]  Why would Fox News not want to cover this?
[00:55:00.501 --> 00:55:00.681]  Right.
[00:55:00.941 --> 00:55:02.282]  Well, because they're all in collusion.
[00:55:02.322 --> 00:55:04.343]  They've got to get Hillary Clinton in.
[00:55:04.783 --> 00:55:08.405]  And that's, you know, that's one of the pieces that we hear in this video.
[00:55:08.425 --> 00:55:10.686]  This is operative Scott Foval.
[00:55:10.726 --> 00:55:14.428]  He says, it doesn't matter what the friggin' legal and ethics people say.
[00:55:14.768 --> 00:55:15.669]  We need to win this.
[00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:19.511]  I mean, that sums it up right there.
[00:55:19.611 --> 00:55:22.152]  They do not care if it's legal or ethical.
[00:55:22.632 --> 00:55:24.774]  They want to win no matter what.
[00:55:24.874 --> 00:55:27.375]  And so they've taken this bird-dogging tactic.
[00:55:27.715 --> 00:55:29.656]  Kit Daniels breaks it down pretty well in his article.
[00:55:29.696 --> 00:55:32.118]  You can also find it there in the Project Veritas article.
[00:55:32.998 --> 00:55:33.378]  I don't know.
[00:56:03.178 --> 00:56:03.678]  Absolutely.
[00:56:03.718 --> 00:56:07.719]  Not only that, but don't you like it how they take something that's actually true for the other side?
[00:56:07.739 --> 00:56:21.162]  Like, for example, if somebody goes outside wearing a Trump hat, we've covered this on InfoWars, this man was pummeled by a crowd, beaten senseless, he was running for his life, and yet they're trying to pin the violence on people that actively support Trump.
[00:56:21.462 --> 00:56:24.823]  But you and I know this, and we've covered Trump rallies before.
[00:56:24.843 --> 00:56:28.344]  Those are some of the most gracious, polite people I have ever encountered.
[00:56:28.624 --> 00:56:34.388]  Typically, the ones screaming and yelling and pushing are always the Hillary supporters every time without fail.
[00:56:34.508 --> 00:56:35.329]  It's remarkable.
[00:56:35.409 --> 00:56:50.799]  Well, we also recall, I believe it was in Costa Mesa, California, where they had those really violent protesters coming out, egging that woman, cornering her, and there was probably 50 people around yelling, and she was, they wouldn't allow her in the building because they didn't want this huge crowd to break through the doors.
[00:56:50.819 --> 00:56:57.924]  I mean, totally violent protesters, and yet CNN, MSNBC, the networks, they were all talking about how violent the Trump
[00:56:59.005 --> 00:57:02.008]  I mean, it's just total psy-op happening.
[00:57:02.028 --> 00:57:06.353]  And that's the media that we now know is colluding with the Clinton campaign.
[00:57:06.393 --> 00:57:07.854]  We've seen that in the WikiLeaks.
[00:57:08.315 --> 00:57:10.978]  You know, and it's crazy, too, that you alluded to earlier.
[00:57:10.998 --> 00:57:17.144]  I mean, Alex Jones and InfoWars has been talking about this for a while, how they pay these people to agitate.
[00:57:18.746 --> 00:57:20.047]  It's so crazy to say that.
[00:57:20.087 --> 00:57:21.549]  It's like, oh my gosh, that's so out there.
[00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:22.249]  That's so wild.
[00:57:22.289 --> 00:57:23.390]  How could that actually be going on?
[00:57:24.031 --> 00:57:25.872]  No, this is what's going on.
[00:57:26.353 --> 00:57:31.417]  And, you know, I would like to just salute Project Veritas and James O'Keefe.
[00:57:31.997 --> 00:57:34.179]  You know, this video is not only
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:38.924]  It's so courageous, this type of journalism, but very well produced.
[00:57:39.345 --> 00:57:49.916]  You know, I think for non-partisan, undecided, just straight down the line, this is a video that they did a great job producing and really just hitting home.
[00:57:49.976 --> 00:57:51.138]  I mean, it really hits home.
[00:57:51.198 --> 00:57:52.239]  It gave me chills.
[00:57:52.539 --> 00:57:52.760]  Right.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:58.701]  I think that honestly though with this, Owen, we saw this with the Planned Parenthood sting operation.
[00:57:58.981 --> 00:58:02.242]  They tried to vilify the journalist, get him indicted on some trumped up charge.
[00:58:02.542 --> 00:58:13.565]  You know, this young man, he really did put his neck out there, but you see in the media, and I'm waiting for this to happen, you know, in the days to come where they're going to actually say, you know what, those words were spent, they were heavily edited.
[00:58:13.585 --> 00:58:14.905]  Well, you can't make this stuff up.
[00:58:14.945 --> 00:58:16.346]  Those were complete sentences.
[00:58:16.366 --> 00:58:17.546]  Calling for the jailing of
[00:58:18.166 --> 00:58:22.608]  There's no way to edit, you know, what these people were saying to make that narrative fit.
[00:58:22.729 --> 00:58:23.429]  There just isn't.
[00:58:23.509 --> 00:58:33.935]  Yeah, and it really, I think, shows the psychological disposition of the people that we're dealing with that work inside the Democratic Party, that are working for Hillary Clinton.
[00:58:34.555 --> 00:58:36.396]  As you pointed out, these people have no ethics.
[00:58:36.716 --> 00:58:37.817]  They don't care about ethics.
[00:58:37.837 --> 00:58:39.278]  They just want to get Hillary Clinton in.
[00:58:40.098 --> 00:58:41.539]  And I don't know what they're motivated by.
[00:58:41.559 --> 00:58:42.840]  I don't understand if it's...
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:48.803]  Yeah, maybe money, but certainly not ethical things, certainly not the American Constitution.
[00:58:49.123 --> 00:58:50.804]  That's going to do it for the nightly news.
