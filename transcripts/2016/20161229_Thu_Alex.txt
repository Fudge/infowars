[00:00:07.285 --> 00:00:12.366]  Hard to believe it's already the 29th day of December 2016.
[00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:16.147]  We've got a key report for you right now.
[00:00:16.147 --> 00:00:17.747]  Breaking down the NDA.
[00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:32.530]  From Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:39.831]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:49.675]  If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever.
[00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:58.618]  The moral to be drawn from this dangerous nightmare situation is a simple one.
[00:00:58.618 --> 00:00:59.398]  Don't let it happen.
[00:01:01.092 --> 00:01:02.493]  It depends on you.
[00:01:02.493 --> 00:01:16.458]  The Internet's renaissance of media, living on a revolutionary platform that has exponentially boomed since it was conceived at UCLA on October 29th, 1969, is yet again under attack.
[00:01:16.458 --> 00:01:21.060]  This bane to the New World Order and adversely a voice of humanity
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:31.951]  Simply disseminating the truth behind the mainstream media's governmental facade must be controlled and centralized if the power structure is to remain.
[00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:33.392]  Merry Christmas everybody!
[00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:43.603]  So while America innocently celebrated the holidays, America's shadow government buried a time bomb in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act.
[00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:50.707]  Relegating control of the free press to what is being dubbed the State Department's Ministry of Truth.
[00:01:50.707 --> 00:01:58.352]  It's amazing they're going to spend $160 million over two years to have the State Department determine what is propaganda and what isn't.
[00:01:58.352 --> 00:01:59.573]  Fake news.
[00:01:59.573 --> 00:02:04.035]  When they didn't like one particular story that was being advanced, when I say they, I think we know who they are.
[00:02:04.035 --> 00:02:06.577]  They are either the ruling class or the whoever.
[00:02:06.577 --> 00:02:08.138]  They called it a conspiracy theory.
[00:02:08.778 --> 00:02:12.642]  That warned them because those things kept turning out to be true.
[00:02:12.642 --> 00:02:22.012]  So they said, you know, we need something new or some Orwellian, dystopian, you know, vocabulary, some argument, you know, what can we use?
[00:02:22.012 --> 00:02:24.194]  Ah, fake news, rather base.
[00:02:24.855 --> 00:02:25.736]  But rather clear.
[00:02:54.755 --> 00:02:55.135]  We're good.
[00:03:10.393 --> 00:03:23.857]  With the legalization of propaganda within the United States Interior in 2013 after the death of the long-standing Smith-Munn Act, the creeping UN and EU control of the Internet after the U.S.
[00:03:23.857 --> 00:03:39.462]  Commerce Department released its grasp to ICANN on October 1st of 2016, the rollout of the fake news narrative and its impending censorship by the bullying anti-First Amendment purveyors of news commandeering sites like
[00:03:39.662 --> 00:03:47.446]  Facebook and now the final nail in the coffin after the 2017 NDAA was signed into law on December 23rd.
[00:03:47.446 --> 00:03:53.609]  The Ministry of Truth framework is in place and the game is now completely rigged.
[00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.651]  In the words of selfless wonderkind Aaron Swartz, information is power.
[00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:03.236]  But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves.
[00:04:03.236 --> 00:04:18.395]  And as if answering Swartz from across the expanse of time and space, founding father Thomas Jefferson prophetically said, the basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right.
[00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:29.562]  And were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.
[00:04:29.562 --> 00:04:35.626]  But I should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them.
[00:04:35.626 --> 00:04:41.289]  The question... How does one man assert power over another?
[00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.291]  By making himself.
[00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:44.191]  Exactly.
[00:04:44.191 --> 00:04:47.013]  Power is tearing human minds apart.
[00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.792]  John Barron for InfoWars.com.
[00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:57.937]  Where the priest of power went, it's all about attacking humanity, attacking God.
[00:04:57.937 --> 00:04:59.018]  We're devil worshippers.
[00:05:01.207 --> 00:05:06.429]  Would it surprise you to know that ISIS and Hezbollah are operating freely in Latin America.
[00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:12.430]  And these Islamic terrorists, they can raise money and they're all planning to attack the United States while in Latin America.
[00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.951]  Now, this part of the world has become a hotbed for Islamic terrorism.
[00:05:15.951 --> 00:05:17.792]  Groups like ISIS operate freely.
[00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:21.473]  They're able to raise large sums of money to finance activities in other countries.
[00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:23.094]  Mainly here in the United States.
[00:05:23.094 --> 00:05:27.157]  Now this is according to one report released by Spain's defense ministry.
[00:05:27.157 --> 00:05:28.498]  I'm quoting directly here.
[00:05:28.498 --> 00:05:31.581]  The US has been largely not focused on the Latin American activity.
[00:05:40.868 --> 00:05:51.399]  But this specifically highlights the fact that ISIS and Hezbollah, they can operate freely in Spain, raise money, and their government in the region is considering ISIS to be a foreign problem.
[00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:56.104]  This report is saying intelligence agencies are ill-equipped to handle the threat that they represent.
[00:05:56.104 --> 00:05:58.066]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:08.937]  All across the Western world, MSM is attempting to demonize the language and words we use, saying, don't say Merry Christmas, use holidays.
[00:06:08.937 --> 00:06:10.478]  And now they say, don't use holiday.
[00:06:10.478 --> 00:06:11.939]  Well, I've got some news for them.
[00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:19.606]  We're going to continue to use the speech we feel like using, and we're going to exercise the First Amendment in your globalist, tyrannical faces.
[00:06:19.606 --> 00:06:24.470]  And that's why I'm extending the Christmas sale this year, right through into the start of 2017.

[00:07:00.792 --> 00:07:07.302]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:16.596]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[00:07:16.596 --> 00:07:18.998]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[00:07:45.615 --> 00:07:52.020]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.025]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:07:57.025 --> 00:07:57.865]  Thursday, December 29th, 2016.
[00:08:17.957 --> 00:08:22.683]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.683 --> 00:08:24.466]  Move, bitch!
[00:08:24.466 --> 00:08:27.509]  Get out the way!
[00:08:28.831 --> 00:08:34.312]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:08:34.312 --> 00:08:36.373]  I will not let you down.
[00:08:36.373 --> 00:08:40.173]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:08:40.173 --> 00:08:43.214]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:08:43.214 --> 00:08:46.155]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:08:46.155 --> 00:08:55.256]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:08:55.256 --> 00:08:57.397]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:58.297 --> 00:08:58.940]  Alex Jones!
[00:09:15.527 --> 00:09:21.693]  We're now only 21 days out from the historic inauguration of Donald John Trump.
[00:09:21.693 --> 00:09:23.795]  That'd be 45, baby.
[00:09:23.795 --> 00:09:26.297]  And return the republic.
[00:09:26.297 --> 00:09:31.201]  Return the republic to its former freeness.
[00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:34.584]  Its greatness as the economic powerhouse of the globe.
[00:09:35.809 --> 00:09:39.575]  Only then can we be the cultural and military powerhouse.
[00:09:39.575 --> 00:09:47.307]  The return of America is upon us if we simply continue to breathe life into its lungs.
[00:09:48.986 --> 00:10:09.830]  It is Thursday, the 29th day of December 2016, in the waning twilight hours of this historic year, as we plunge into 2017, which is guaranteed to be even more tumultuous, more hard-fought, more bitter, but also more exhilarating and filled with opportunity.
[00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:14.791]  Fortune favors the bold, and our fortune is freedom in our time.
[00:10:16.451 --> 00:10:19.752]  The mission is hard, but not impossible.
[00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:22.733]  You've got a long way to go.
[00:10:22.733 --> 00:10:24.533]  Short time to get there.
[00:10:24.533 --> 00:10:28.934]  But the taste of victory is now revitalizing the Republic.
[00:10:28.934 --> 00:10:34.996]  And like the fiery bird of myth, the Phoenix, he's rising!
[00:10:34.996 --> 00:10:37.316]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:10:37.316 --> 00:10:39.137]  Alright, let's get really focused here.
[00:10:40.424 --> 00:10:50.086]  DrudgeReport.com has an incredible grouping of stories that everybody must look at on the right-hand side.
[00:10:50.086 --> 00:10:55.888]  You cannot make up the oxymoronic, upside-down world of this.
[00:10:55.888 --> 00:11:02.109]  Soros says Trump is a would-be dictator who threatens the new world order.
[00:11:04.994 --> 00:11:07.355]  That's an Infowars.com story.
[00:11:07.355 --> 00:11:08.796]  Top story on the right hand side.
[00:11:08.796 --> 00:11:14.198]  And under it you can actually read the full screed of diarrhea out of Soros' mouth.
[00:11:14.198 --> 00:11:19.320]  Billionaire globalist pins panicked rant.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.620]  And boy is it panicked.
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.001]  He says, we cannot stop nationalism.
[00:11:23.001 --> 00:11:28.784]  And he said, not since I was a young man have I feared Trump is Hitler.
[00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:34.952]  Ladies and gentlemen, he actually calls Trump Hitler and a dictator.
[00:11:34.952 --> 00:11:40.054]  He calls him a Hitlerian dictator.
[00:11:40.054 --> 00:11:42.475]  Now, is this lost on anyone?
[00:11:42.475 --> 00:11:54.678]  George Soros is a famous Nazi collaborator from the age of 13 to 17.
[00:11:54.678 --> 00:12:00.140]  Because no one thought that a young Jew coming in and claiming he was helping get food to groups that were hiding
[00:12:01.445 --> 00:12:03.426]  would actually be a Nazi agent.
[00:12:03.426 --> 00:12:12.633]  He was a literal Nazi agent of the lowest scumbag order, and he's going to lecture us about Adolf Hitler.
[00:12:12.633 --> 00:12:14.694]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:12:14.694 --> 00:12:17.676]  It is the total, complete inversion of reality.
[00:12:17.676 --> 00:12:22.300]  We have him on 60 Minutes saying he is not ashamed of what he did.
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:29.865]  It's how he, quote, survived a total sociopath who's got a big, giant you-know-what for America.
[00:12:32.026 --> 00:12:34.428]  A raging you-know-what to screw this country.
[00:12:34.428 --> 00:12:36.529]  And guess what scumbag?
[00:12:36.529 --> 00:12:37.950]  You think you're losing now?
[00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.632]  Go ahead and start a war.
[00:12:39.632 --> 00:12:41.373]  Go ahead and try to assassinate Trump.
[00:12:41.373 --> 00:12:44.235]  Go ahead and fill your hand, you rat bastard.
[00:12:44.235 --> 00:12:49.539]  We're going to get you.
[00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:52.301]  And I'm glad they've tried to take down Trump and put up his lies.
[00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:54.082]  Because the gloves are off now, brother.
[00:12:54.082 --> 00:12:57.065]  And when Trump gets in office in 21 days, get ready scum.
[00:12:58.257 --> 00:13:05.324]  Because you should have been arrested and in a lot of trouble back when you were 15 years old.
[00:13:05.324 --> 00:13:07.426]  You can run on for a long time, boy.
[00:13:07.426 --> 00:13:11.790]  I mean, look at your failure son.
[00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.051]  He's a laughing stock.
[00:13:13.051 --> 00:13:14.293]  That's who you're gonna have run your empire?
[00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:16.715]  No, you'd rather blow the planet up, wouldn't you, scumbag?
[00:13:16.715 --> 00:13:20.379]  You're not gonna get away with it.
[00:13:20.379 --> 00:13:22.240]  You are a true supervillain.
[00:13:23.354 --> 00:13:25.096]  Out to hurt good people.
[00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:27.918]  You hate Christians, you're a dirtbag.
[00:13:27.918 --> 00:13:32.222]  And it's in the WikiLeaks how you want to overthrow Israel.
[00:13:32.222 --> 00:13:35.846]  Of course you're allied, and your new pivot is with the Islamicists.
[00:13:35.846 --> 00:13:39.229]  And people, Israel's got its problems, it's a diverse, modern country.
[00:13:39.229 --> 00:13:41.611]  My God.
[00:13:41.611 --> 00:13:47.777]  But... We're gonna side with Soros and the Islamicists that suicide bombed their little kids?
[00:13:47.777 --> 00:13:48.638]  No.
[00:13:48.638 --> 00:13:48.778]  No.
[00:13:50.353 --> 00:14:02.478]  This is disgusting, and a lot of people out there have been brainwashed into just obsessing on Israel all day and hating Israel, and it's quite frankly shameful.
[00:14:02.478 --> 00:14:10.602]  Because the only way to get rid of Israel is a nuclear war, and the Arabs would start killing each other the minute they got control of the Holy Land.
[00:14:12.694 --> 00:14:23.417]  Long before Mohammed showed up in Mecca riding around robbing caravans and sex slaving, there were Jews in Jerusalem, Jack.
[00:14:23.417 --> 00:14:25.138]  3,000 plus years ago!
[00:14:25.138 --> 00:14:25.858]  On record!
[00:14:25.858 --> 00:14:28.759]  Roman historians, Greek historians, it's a fact!
[00:14:32.011 --> 00:14:35.872]  No amount of revisionist history will erase that, or that Jesus Christ existed.
[00:14:35.872 --> 00:14:38.693]  I see articles in Time Magazine that Jesus didn't exist.
[00:14:38.693 --> 00:14:42.334]  Oh, there's only like 20 Roman historians wrote about him at the time.
[00:14:42.334 --> 00:14:43.854]  Five or six Jewish historians.
[00:14:43.854 --> 00:14:46.455]  You're a pack of liars.
[00:14:46.455 --> 00:14:50.696]  I suspect they're going to tell us George Washington didn't exist next.
[00:14:50.696 --> 00:14:51.777]  I'm tired of it.
[00:14:51.777 --> 00:14:52.997]  I'm tired of the ignorance.
[00:14:52.997 --> 00:14:54.998]  I'm tired of the idiocy.
[00:14:54.998 --> 00:14:56.778]  And I just can't take it anymore.
[00:14:56.778 --> 00:14:59.259]  It is not fair, and I've used this story a million times, it's so true.
[00:15:00.573 --> 00:15:05.136]  Both my grandfathers almost died in World War II in the Army Air Corps.
[00:15:05.136 --> 00:15:06.257]  Both of them almost died.
[00:15:06.257 --> 00:15:22.889]  One of them crashed land at the other, did his missions, had volunteered for more, but got sunstroke from not wearing sunglasses, burned his eyes, he was blind for a week, and the crew went up with the co-pilot and got blown up and died over Italy.
[00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:24.971]  They were attacking out of North Africa.
[00:15:24.971 --> 00:15:29.134]  And then he almost died when German fighter bombers hit their bases once they got into Italy.
[00:15:30.325 --> 00:15:44.935]  You got a purple heart for that, but the point is, I get called a Nazi by the ADL, who gives awards to Soros, and Schwarzenegger, who says he admires Hitler, when I almost don't exist, because you killed my grandfathers, you killed me.
[00:15:44.935 --> 00:15:51.060]  And then I've got to sit here and watch a known Nazi collaborator hop around and call our president
[00:15:52.293 --> 00:15:53.415]  A Nazi.
[00:15:53.415 --> 00:15:56.860]  George Soros groups also called him anti-semitic throughout the campaign.
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.767]  I mean, this is the complete inversion of reality.
[00:16:05.504 --> 00:16:06.504]  Not shocking!
[00:16:06.504 --> 00:16:08.585]  George Soros funds progressive war on Israel.
[00:16:08.585 --> 00:16:11.826]  He wants to overthrow it, folks.
[00:16:11.826 --> 00:16:13.607]  The guy is a total demon.
[00:16:13.607 --> 00:16:14.768]  He wants your guns.
[00:16:14.768 --> 00:16:16.108]  He wants your family.
[00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:17.529]  He believes the state should run you.
[00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:19.689]  He's a control freak.
[00:16:19.689 --> 00:16:21.710]  He's a monster.
[00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.071]  He wants power.
[00:16:23.071 --> 00:16:28.493]  He's behind flooding Europe with Islamists.
[00:16:28.493 --> 00:16:34.015]  But I'm telling you, this goes to another level that no media is pointing out.
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.780]  That Soros is a Nazi.
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:48.243]  And you know, I've had Hollywood people on the show before, and I start bashing Soros liberals who are on, historians, authors, you name it, and they'll go, Alex, now come on, Soros had to or he'd get killed.
[00:16:48.243 --> 00:16:53.405]  That's like saying, I've got to join the New World Order or I'll get killed.
[00:16:53.405 --> 00:16:56.745]  It's the most sociopathic mindset I've ever seen in my life.
[00:16:56.745 --> 00:16:58.546]  And it's the creed of slaves.
[00:16:58.546 --> 00:17:00.186]  So the story's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:01.827]  It's obviously on DrugsReport.com.
[00:17:01.827 --> 00:17:03.027]  It's a Paul Joseph Watson article.
[00:17:04.463 --> 00:17:09.765]  Soros conjures Hitler in attack on ascendant populist.
[00:17:09.765 --> 00:17:13.647]  That's the area that Zero Hedge decided to zero in on.
[00:17:13.647 --> 00:17:23.531]  We should have a whole other article out just about famous Nazi collaborator says Trump reminds him of Hitler.
[00:17:23.531 --> 00:17:25.332]  What in the world?
[00:17:25.332 --> 00:17:28.113]  He says, I'm afraid of Nazis.
[00:17:28.113 --> 00:17:29.574]  What?
[00:17:29.574 --> 00:17:32.155]  You are a Nazi dirtbag.
[00:17:32.155 --> 00:17:33.716]  You're the lowest scum on earth.
[00:17:35.031 --> 00:17:37.453]  At least the Nazis thought they were doing something for a good reason.
[00:17:37.453 --> 00:17:39.495]  They were out of their minds in a death goal.
[00:17:39.495 --> 00:17:49.643]  You were a collaborator against your own people and betrayed them, scumbag, and made money off of it with your daddy.
[00:17:49.643 --> 00:17:55.268]  He was a little Judas goat, they said, and kind of like pedophiles send a teenager in or another kid to get other kids lured to the van.
[00:17:56.021 --> 00:18:02.764]  Yes, George Soros was the bait they would throw out to bring in and find where the Jews were hidden.
[00:18:02.764 --> 00:18:06.586]  I mean, you just cannot make this stuff up.
[00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:08.386]  You couldn't write this stuff.
[00:18:08.386 --> 00:18:09.647]  No one would believe it.
[00:18:09.647 --> 00:18:16.750]  And now he's perched on top of the country, blaming Russia for America turning against Hillary, while she's stumbling around having convulsions.
[00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.131]  Everybody's sick of her.
[00:18:18.131 --> 00:18:19.491]  Russia wasn't involved in anything.
[00:18:19.491 --> 00:18:25.354]  You've got the Communist Chinese, the EU, the Vatican, the Saudi Arabians, all piled up on our election.
[00:18:25.954 --> 00:18:27.816]  Saying we can't have Trump.
[00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:43.130]  That gets overthrown and now Obama is set to announce all sorts of wartime measures and troop buildups and cyber attacks and diplomatic freezing of Russian money and all this economic war with 21 days out.
[00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:44.331]  And I was watching CNN.
[00:18:44.331 --> 00:18:45.492]  I forget the names of the shows.
[00:18:45.492 --> 00:18:46.112]  I rarely watch it.
[00:18:46.112 --> 00:18:48.935]  I was watching it last night and they had a roundtable grip on it.
[00:18:48.935 --> 00:18:50.716]  I've got to go look at the show host.
[00:18:50.716 --> 00:18:51.057]  It was like
[00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:53.779]  6.30 at night.
[00:18:53.779 --> 00:18:55.239]  Who's on at 6.30?
[00:18:55.239 --> 00:18:55.860]  Some guy.
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.660]  I don't know his name.
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.541]  Some gray-haired dude.
[00:18:58.541 --> 00:19:10.426]  He had this roundtable on there and they were, folks, just like before 9-11, 25 days before, I came on there and I said they're going to blow up the World Trade Center, blame it on Bin Laden, get ready for terrorism.
[00:19:10.426 --> 00:19:12.547]  I saw the same tell-tale signs.
[00:19:12.547 --> 00:19:15.809]  They said, it is going to be Trump's fault, the war that's coming now.
[00:19:17.139 --> 00:19:18.980]  Islam is going to attack Europe and Israel.
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:27.584]  There is a giant war coming, and there's going to be a war with Russia, and it is Trump's fault, and all the roundtable goes, it's very sad, but it is to be.
[00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:44.413]  And you can tell, the fix is in, they're going to start World War III, they're a frickin' loon cult, who are under Stockholm Syndrome, and under Arabist control, and this is a real pivot to Islam, and the takedown of the West, and it was a cult of scum, a bunch of CIA operatives up there on the show, all
[00:19:44.853 --> 00:19:49.755]  Committing to a giant war, and then America's gonna have to be destroyed now because we voted for Trump.
[00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:58.057]  I mean, criminals love to brag, and I saw them do the pre-celebration of World War III, and the destruction of Israel and the United States.
[00:19:58.057 --> 00:19:59.478]  I saw psychopathic behavior.
[00:20:01.445 --> 00:20:02.705]  Maybe not today.
[00:20:02.705 --> 00:20:03.986]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[00:20:03.986 --> 00:20:07.727]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[00:20:07.727 --> 00:20:08.808]  Forget bunkers.
[00:20:08.808 --> 00:20:10.648]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[00:20:10.648 --> 00:20:12.349]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[00:22:59.781 --> 00:23:02.522]  Taking turmeric is good, but there's a problem with it.

[00:24:05.825 --> 00:24:07.427]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:07.427 --> 00:24:12.673]  It was Jim Scutto last night that was sitting in for Wolf Blitzer on the Situation Room.
[00:24:12.673 --> 00:24:15.216]  And again, I watched about 30 minutes of it before I left the office.
[00:24:16.992 --> 00:24:29.476]  And maybe for the nightly news tonight, I'll actually go back and find that archive and play these clips, but they had a roundtable going, it's Trump's fault, and he's going to start a war now, and it's his fault, and the war is inevitable.
[00:24:29.476 --> 00:24:34.497]  And they were all very satisfied, and they said some really bizarre stuff.
[00:24:34.497 --> 00:24:39.999]  They had a professor on there, and they were saying, Trump's only going with his instincts and his advisors.
[00:24:39.999 --> 00:24:41.880]  So he doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.220]  This is going to cause a war.
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.621]  Well, what are you following, your advisors and instincts?
[00:24:47.329 --> 00:24:49.390]  They act like no one can think but them.
[00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:50.531]  It's this disconnect.
[00:24:50.531 --> 00:24:53.773]  Plus, they're not even telling us what their real aims are.
[00:24:53.773 --> 00:24:58.335]  They're saying to the world, you elected Trump, so we're going to start a war with Russia.
[00:24:58.335 --> 00:25:03.998]  We're going to start a war in the Middle East, and we're going to give a green light for the new intifada.
[00:25:03.998 --> 00:25:14.324]  That means a giant uprising, a rebellion, a civil war initiated by the United States siding with the United Nations.
[00:25:15.578 --> 00:25:19.920]  To plunge the globe into a worldwide crisis.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.981]  Not for the Palestinians!
[00:25:21.981 --> 00:25:30.724]  The globalists financed the Islamist invasion of Syria that's killed over 300,000 people, almost all of them Christians and non-radical Muslims.
[00:25:30.724 --> 00:25:36.626]  They call it a conspiracy theory that our government financed this in the last six years.
[00:25:36.626 --> 00:25:37.887]  It's all public.
[00:25:37.887 --> 00:25:39.067]  Congress has had hearings.
[00:25:39.067 --> 00:25:40.188]  The military has gone public.
[00:25:41.027 --> 00:25:48.633]  It's like the news is saying it's a conspiracy that the United States was behind the vote at the UN and the abstention.
[00:25:48.633 --> 00:25:50.234]  They're behind the whole deal!
[00:25:50.234 --> 00:25:51.715]  They've bragged they're behind it!
[00:25:51.715 --> 00:25:55.378]  I mean, it's a new type of psychological warfare, and I don't think it's working.
[00:25:55.378 --> 00:26:01.562]  I think it's delusion, where they go, we're not behind this vote, even though they admit they are.
[00:26:01.562 --> 00:26:04.444]  There's no, there's no IRS penalties.
[00:26:04.444 --> 00:26:07.527]  There's not 18,000 IRS agents in Obamacare.
[00:26:08.817 --> 00:26:09.977]  The hell they're in?
[00:26:09.977 --> 00:26:11.238]  It's right there in the bill!
[00:26:11.238 --> 00:26:12.678]  And now people are getting hit with it.
[00:26:12.678 --> 00:26:13.978]  That's what I mean.
[00:26:13.978 --> 00:26:15.639]  I think these people are crazy.
[00:26:15.639 --> 00:26:24.281]  You know, they've got a method to what they're doing, but it's total delusion, cuckoo, cocoa puff land.
[00:26:24.281 --> 00:26:26.561]  It's crazy.
[00:26:26.561 --> 00:26:29.942]  Because the whole world, I mean, they've got polls of
[00:26:33.345 --> 00:26:45.097]  60 plus percent of Americans on the low end, 80 plus percent on the high end, in dozens of polls, you've all seen them, almost no one's buying that Russia was involved in our election, and people don't care!
[00:26:45.097 --> 00:26:55.267]  Because it was a global free-for-all of all these other countries trying to say, we can't have a populist movement.
[00:26:57.136 --> 00:27:04.644]  But when Soros and globalist publications like the Financial Times, the Economist, the New York Times admit what's happening, they know it's not racism.
[00:27:04.644 --> 00:27:06.946]  They know it's not Hitlerian.
[00:27:06.946 --> 00:27:16.216]  They know it's just classic nationalism where we want economic systems that are good for us as countries and as individuals, not good for the globalists and their big world government project!
[00:27:18.254 --> 00:27:29.676]  We don't want to be ruled by secret TPP and WTO and all these unlawful treaties that don't even get ratified most of the time, but we live under them.
[00:27:29.676 --> 00:27:35.378]  Just like the UK never voted in the 80s and the 90s under the different treaties, like Lisbon, to enter it.
[00:27:35.378 --> 00:27:42.479]  And people are like, we didn't vote to enter, and it makes over 90% of our laws, and it's flooding us with unskilled, dangerous jihadists?
[00:27:42.479 --> 00:27:43.999]  We don't want to be part of this!
[00:27:43.999 --> 00:27:45.059]  And they say, shut up!
[00:27:45.059 --> 00:27:45.920]  You are under it!
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.180]  We don't care how you voted!
[00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.210]  People say, well Alex, gee, what does it matter?
[00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.011]  They're ignoring it.
[00:27:52.011 --> 00:27:52.591]  Good!
[00:27:52.591 --> 00:27:54.851]  That'll blow up in their face bigger!
[00:27:54.851 --> 00:27:59.052]  You mean the UK says, we vote to get out, you say no?
[00:27:59.052 --> 00:28:00.552]  We have the moral high ground.
[00:28:00.552 --> 00:28:02.072]  We're going to win.
[00:28:02.072 --> 00:28:03.292]  That's why they're panicking.
[00:28:03.292 --> 00:28:04.493]  It's why they're freaking out.
[00:28:04.493 --> 00:28:05.893]  It's why they're pulling their hair out.
[00:28:05.893 --> 00:28:14.414]  When we come back, I have a clip of him on 60 Minutes saying he did what he had to working with the Nazis.
[00:28:14.414 --> 00:28:16.655]  That'd be like if somebody said, kill your family or we'll kill you.
[00:28:16.655 --> 00:28:17.715]  I'd say, pull the freaking trigger!
[00:28:19.138 --> 00:28:21.682]  But I'd try to take you out before I did that.
[00:28:21.682 --> 00:28:25.647]  But it's this attitude to lay down and give up.
[00:28:25.647 --> 00:28:34.060]  Only one Jewish neighborhood stood up against the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto in Poland, and they killed, it's estimated, over 5,000 of them in just a year.
[00:28:35.427 --> 00:28:40.252]  And it took them months and months and months to even take the ghetto finally.
[00:28:40.252 --> 00:28:46.038]  One group of Jews, maybe a thousand, stood up with a couple firearms and held the Nazis off for months.
[00:28:46.038 --> 00:28:48.660]  What would have happened if people would have stood up against Hitler in Europe?
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.562]  We wouldn't have had this crap.
[00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:54.026]  And now we have this little monster running around.
[00:28:56.613 --> 00:29:10.081]  Overthrowing countries, destabilizing the Middle East, backing jihadists, overthrowing Ukraine, trying to start a war with Russia, and he's financing the Democratic Party to try to start a war with Russia and a war with Israel because he's throwing a temper tantrum.
[00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:11.141]  There he is in the news.
[00:29:11.141 --> 00:29:14.583]  Billionaire globalist pins panicked rant.
[00:29:14.583 --> 00:29:22.348]  We have a dangerous, psychopathic demon in control of the Democratic Party and MSM trying to start a frickin' world war.
[00:29:24.278 --> 00:29:26.041]  And I get the fact he's a Rothschild agent.
[00:29:26.041 --> 00:29:27.383]  That's why he's so powerful.
[00:29:27.383 --> 00:29:28.965]  And you guys think you're invincible.
[00:29:28.965 --> 00:29:30.267]  You're not.
[00:29:30.267 --> 00:29:34.653]  The Rothschilds sued British newspapers for saying they were behind the New World Order.
[00:29:34.653 --> 00:29:36.256]  They lost in court five years ago.
[00:29:37.372 --> 00:29:42.314]  And the court said, no, this finds you were behind the Russian oligarchs and sucking that country dry.
[00:29:42.314 --> 00:29:48.117]  I'm telling Soros, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, everybody else, you're not going to pull this off in the dark this time.
[00:29:48.117 --> 00:29:50.679]  You understand we got a big old spotlight on your butt.
[00:29:50.679 --> 00:29:54.581]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.581 --> 00:29:57.282]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.184 --> 00:30:06.426]  Would it surprise you to know that ISIS and Hezbollah are operating freely in Latin America.
[00:30:06.426 --> 00:30:12.369]  And these Islamic terrorists, they can raise money and they're all planning to attack the United States while in Latin America.
[00:30:12.369 --> 00:30:15.951]  Now, this part of the world has become a hotbed for Islamic terrorism.
[00:30:15.951 --> 00:30:17.811]  Groups like ISIS operate freely.
[00:30:17.811 --> 00:30:21.473]  They're able to raise large sums of money to finance activities in other countries.
[00:30:21.493 --> 00:30:21.793]  I think?
[00:30:40.831 --> 00:30:56.104]  But this specifically highlights the fact that ISIS and Hezbollah, they can operate freely in Spain, raise money, and their government in the region is considering ISIS to be a foreign problem, this report is saying, and intelligence agencies are ill-equipped to handle the threat that they represent.
[00:30:56.104 --> 00:30:58.787]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:31:00.831 --> 00:31:01.651]  Hey, everyone!
[00:31:01.651 --> 00:31:03.952]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[00:31:03.952 --> 00:31:07.792]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:31:07.792 --> 00:31:09.853]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:31:09.853 --> 00:31:20.135]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:31:20.135 --> 00:31:26.116]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:31:26.596 --> 00:31:47.350]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work, you need to check out InfoWarsTeam.com.

[00:31:49.332 --> 00:31:49.712]  Head over to
[00:31:49.932 --> 00:31:51.754]  Infowarsteam.com.
[00:31:51.754 --> 00:31:53.616]  Your body will be very grateful.
[00:31:53.616 --> 00:31:56.659]  On the web at Infowarsteam.com.
[00:31:56.659 --> 00:31:58.020]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:09.942]  As we get ready to kick off 2017, it's more important than ever to realize it's the First Amendment that allowed us to defeat the globalist witch Hillary Clinton.
[00:32:09.942 --> 00:32:13.663]  And these enemies of free speech are out there telling us, don't say Merry Christmas.
[00:32:13.663 --> 00:32:14.943]  In fact, don't even say holidays.
[00:32:14.943 --> 00:32:16.323]  Well, I got news for them.
[00:32:16.323 --> 00:32:24.105]  Just because of them doing that, I'm going to extend our Christmas sales right through into 2017.
[00:32:24.105 --> 00:32:26.305]  We're talking store-wide free shipping and
[00:32:26.905 --> 00:32:30.388]  50 to 25% off on the Nutraceuticals and so much more.
[00:32:30.388 --> 00:32:42.397]  So whether it's a Hillary for Prison 2017 shirt or whether it's Survival Shield X2 or Supermail Vitality, we've got the biggest sales of 2016 right into 2017 while supplies last.
[00:32:42.397 --> 00:32:46.761]  We are selling out of many of these items because this sale is so big and we've extended it.
[00:32:46.761 --> 00:32:48.122]  So please take advantage of this.
[00:32:48.122 --> 00:32:55.628]  And again, thank you for fighting for the info war and supporting our operation and supporting not just the First Amendment, but free speech worldwide.
[00:32:55.888 --> 00:32:59.720]  That's InfoWarsStore.com or go right to the supplements at InfoWarsLive.com
[00:33:19.861 --> 00:33:21.563]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:21.563 --> 00:33:23.204]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:23.204 --> 00:33:34.273]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.273 --> 00:33:37.636]  It was Albert Pike who was the head of the Illuminati after the Civil War.
[00:33:37.636 --> 00:33:38.717]  He's also the founder of the KKK.
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:46.202]  That famously wrote in the 1870s that there would be three world wars to bring in world government.
[00:33:46.202 --> 00:33:51.604]  And the final would be between Christians with Jews against the Muslims.
[00:33:51.604 --> 00:33:58.146]  And then out of that would come such a hatred of religion that we would accept a one world religion and the one true God, Lucifer.
[00:33:59.312 --> 00:34:06.314]  Now, whether you believe they're following that plan or not, today, this is the plan being manifested on our planet.
[00:34:06.314 --> 00:34:10.595]  And the Rothschilds, you'd ask, why did they help found Israel?
[00:34:10.595 --> 00:34:16.516]  And then why are Rothschild institutions today funding movements against Israel?
[00:34:16.516 --> 00:34:23.198]  As we see in the WikiLeaks through one of their operatives, that's come out in court, George Soros.
[00:34:23.198 --> 00:34:27.579]  Because it's the chaos that has to be brought in to establish the world government.
[00:34:29.608 --> 00:34:47.073]  It's just like there were a lot of powerful Jewish institutions and groups that wouldn't let Jews get out of Europe and they had to pay on average over a million dollars equivalent to different organizations to be able to get out of the country and they were only allowed to go to Palestine.
[00:34:47.073 --> 00:34:48.433]  That's why FDR refused
[00:34:51.713 --> 00:34:56.275]  So many Jews trying to come into New York and sent them back to Nazi Germany.
[00:34:56.275 --> 00:34:57.496]  I'm not even attacking FDR.
[00:34:57.496 --> 00:34:58.797]  It's just a historic fact.
[00:34:58.797 --> 00:35:03.139]  That's people like Dr. Steve Pachinik, who was part Catholic, part Jewish.
[00:35:03.139 --> 00:35:09.202]  He had to come into Cuba when he was a little kid during World War II because the United States wouldn't take him.
[00:35:09.202 --> 00:35:11.924]  The ships got diverted to Cuba.
[00:35:11.924 --> 00:35:13.705]  That's where a bunch of Jews went.
[00:35:13.705 --> 00:35:14.185]  And that's why
[00:35:15.424 --> 00:35:24.629]  People like Pachinik, you know, don't like the ADL and organizations like that because Jews that are actually well-read know what I'm saying is absolutely historical fact.
[00:35:24.629 --> 00:35:27.750]  That's why it isn't just, are you for the Jews or are you against the Jews?
[00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.151]  Are you clear-cut for Israel or are you against Israel?
[00:35:30.151 --> 00:35:34.053]  I got a lot of problems with different political parties in Israel, stuff that goes on.
[00:35:34.053 --> 00:35:35.194]  I'm a big human rights advocate.
[00:35:36.035 --> 00:35:39.539]  But the Israelis aren't sending their kids to be suicide bombers.
[00:35:39.539 --> 00:35:45.006]  They're not flooding us with 5 million people in Europe, hundreds of thousands here that say they want to overthrow us.
[00:35:45.006 --> 00:35:47.288]  The globalists have pivoted to Islam.
[00:35:47.288 --> 00:35:50.011]  This is a real triple cross, folks.
[00:35:50.011 --> 00:35:52.274]  They're not just doing a class of civilizations.
[00:35:52.274 --> 00:35:55.498]  That's what they sold a lot of the military and insiders on with 9-11.
[00:35:56.499 --> 00:35:59.381]  That was supposed to be some excuse to crush Islam.
[00:35:59.381 --> 00:36:08.289]  It was actually to put Saudi Arabia in charge, knock out the countries that were blocking radical Islam, like Saddam in Iraq, Assad in Syria.
[00:36:08.289 --> 00:36:10.951]  So this is the grand chessboard.
[00:36:10.951 --> 00:36:15.855]  And they're panicking because Trump understands this, the military brass understand this.
[00:36:15.855 --> 00:36:24.603]  They're making deals with Russia, they're making deals with Japan, they're making deals to double-cross all the double-crossers like China and others.
[00:36:25.871 --> 00:36:29.173]  And it's not been clear where Israel was going to side in all of this.
[00:36:29.173 --> 00:36:31.274]  And the Likudniks and Netanyahu.
[00:36:31.274 --> 00:36:34.976]  They didn't really give any overt support to Trump.
[00:36:34.976 --> 00:36:37.338]  Well now, the globalists have miscalculated and...
[00:36:39.113 --> 00:36:44.077]  They think holding the world hostage to nuclear warfare is going to bully everybody into acceptance.
[00:36:44.077 --> 00:36:47.739]  In fact, they say, you better accept globalism or there's going to be a big war.
[00:36:47.739 --> 00:36:55.245]  And now they're hitting the dominoes that will chain reaction into a giant regional war that will probably get bigger.
[00:36:55.245 --> 00:37:00.829]  Because if any NATO forces or others hit Russian forces in Syria, it's off to the races.
[00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:02.410]  That's why you notice they just did a deal.
[00:37:03.834 --> 00:37:08.579]  To begin the process of splitting Syria in three pieces, which was the older plan.
[00:37:08.579 --> 00:37:13.543]  Again, going back to Eisenhower, everything Trump's doing is an older pro-America
[00:37:14.651 --> 00:37:20.674]  Stabilize the world, promote freedom plan that got killed in the mid-60s with LBJ.
[00:37:20.674 --> 00:37:23.055]  Everything's going back to that plan.
[00:37:23.055 --> 00:37:26.036]  That's why, I mean, they've literally taken these plans off the shelves.
[00:37:26.036 --> 00:37:29.217]  And again, no one else knows this, no one else talks about this but insiders.
[00:37:29.217 --> 00:37:32.419]  You're getting the inside scoop here, which I've already reverse-engineered.
[00:37:32.419 --> 00:37:36.000]  The reason all the insiders listen to me is I already reverse-engineered all this.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.183]  Because most of it's in white papers, in documents here and there, and then you have Wesley Clark admitting it and others, and just now it's known.
[00:37:44.471 --> 00:37:54.655]  So there's a race here against a plan for Americana global domination through industry and ideas or through global corporate governance under the IMF and World Bank.
[00:37:54.655 --> 00:37:57.016]  And there's two different competing systems.
[00:37:57.016 --> 00:38:03.339]  So Russia just completed a ceasefire deal between the rebels.
[00:38:03.339 --> 00:38:06.520]  All the factions saying they'll split the country in three parts.
[00:38:09.482 --> 00:38:10.703]  Now, that's an older U.S.
[00:38:10.703 --> 00:38:11.623]  plan.
[00:38:11.623 --> 00:38:23.628]  The plan currently was to hand it over to Saudi Arabia and let Wahhabis kill all the Shiites, kill all the Alawites, kill all the Christians, and turn it into a backwards hellhole.
[00:38:23.628 --> 00:38:30.191]  But a lot of folks now are looking at giving some of the desert, eaten out areas,
[00:38:31.411 --> 00:38:49.834]  that border Iraq to the Islamic State basically to Saudi Arabia and then having a Kurdish area and then having the main coastline and the main cities which is classically Damascus and Aleppo and other areas to the people that want to have a multicultural system.
[00:38:51.533 --> 00:38:55.514]  Now that said, I want to get back into Soros and the bombshell news.
[00:38:55.514 --> 00:38:57.094]  Here he is on 60 Minutes.
[00:38:57.094 --> 00:38:59.975]  They try to remove this clip everywhere, but it's fair use.
[00:38:59.975 --> 00:39:01.915]  The public has a right to know this.
[00:39:01.915 --> 00:39:03.556]  And then here's some of the historical background as well.
[00:39:03.556 --> 00:39:11.137]  George Soros saying he did what he had to do working with the Nazis in Eastern Europe, rounding up fellow Jews to be sent to death camps.
[00:39:11.137 --> 00:39:15.778]  From 1944, what happened to George Soros' friends and neighbors?
[00:39:15.778 --> 00:39:17.699]  Europe, Hungarian Jew.
[00:39:19.446 --> 00:39:24.391]  Who escaped the Holocaust by posing as a Christian.
[00:39:24.391 --> 00:39:30.557]  And you watched lots of people get shipped off to the death camps.
[00:39:30.557 --> 00:39:32.579]  I was 14 years old.
[00:39:32.579 --> 00:39:35.181]  And I would say that that's when my character was made.
[00:39:35.181 --> 00:39:38.885]  It was a tremendous threat of evil.
[00:39:38.885 --> 00:39:41.688]  I mean, it was a very personal experience of evil.
[00:39:43.121 --> 00:39:51.384]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours, who swore that you were his adopted godson.
[00:39:51.384 --> 00:39:52.744]  Yes, yes.
[00:39:52.744 --> 00:39:56.305]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[00:39:56.305 --> 00:39:57.866]  That's right.
[00:39:57.866 --> 00:40:06.969]  That sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years.
[00:40:06.969 --> 00:40:08.249]  Was it difficult?
[00:40:08.249 --> 00:40:10.150]  Not at all.
[00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:15.594]  It was actually probably the happiest year of my life.
[00:40:15.594 --> 00:40:19.979]  That year of German occupation.
[00:40:19.979 --> 00:40:21.560]  And McBrain did it!
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.844]  I knew that there was a Leslie Stahl interview and the other one.
[00:40:24.844 --> 00:40:26.406]  There were two 60 Minutes interviews.
[00:40:27.694 --> 00:40:33.699]  And I hadn't been able to find in years, because they were moving off all the platforms, where he says it was the happiest year of his life.
[00:40:33.699 --> 00:40:41.806]  Now that was a video for a radio listeners that actually had historical documents, film clips of the Nazi Holocaust and the rest of it.
[00:40:41.806 --> 00:40:44.148]  But we're going to put out a dry one if we can, McBrain.
[00:40:44.148 --> 00:40:45.409]  I know Darren McBrain's listening.
[00:40:45.409 --> 00:40:54.837]  That has both of the TV interviews where he in context says it was one of the happiest times in his life, rounding up fellow Jews and sending them off to be worked to death and then murdered.
[00:40:57.259 --> 00:41:00.860]  After they had IBM control numbers put on their arms.
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.501]  Notice who runs the technocracy today.
[00:41:02.501 --> 00:41:07.383]  Oh, it's IBM.
[00:41:07.383 --> 00:41:14.825]  You see, one side of the Rothschild family actually worked with the Nazis, and the family split, and the French Rothschilds actually got rounded up and killed.
[00:41:14.825 --> 00:41:18.667]  These are some nasty people we're dealing with.
[00:41:18.667 --> 00:41:24.589]  And Soros is the type of person these globalists will work with because he helped round up his own people as well.
[00:41:25.728 --> 00:41:29.111]  This is some nasty, nasty, nasty evil, folks.
[00:41:29.111 --> 00:41:34.154]  If you look at criminology and organized crime, they're always feeding on their lowers.
[00:41:34.154 --> 00:41:36.256]  They're always scapegoating their minions.
[00:41:36.256 --> 00:41:40.619]  They're always flushing their own people down the toilet and using them.
[00:41:40.619 --> 00:41:43.662]  Dishonor is the name.
[00:41:43.662 --> 00:41:45.943]  So, two articles up on InfoWars.com.
[00:41:48.007 --> 00:41:51.668]  Several are also up on DrugsReport.com.
[00:41:51.668 --> 00:41:53.388]  It's the easiest place to find them.
[00:41:53.388 --> 00:41:54.468]  I want this red-linked.
[00:41:54.468 --> 00:41:55.489]  Paul didn't red-link this.
[00:41:55.489 --> 00:41:58.289]  I think Paul should red-link his article.
[00:41:58.289 --> 00:42:02.910]  Soros, Trump is a would-be dictator who threatens the New World Order.
[00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:06.731]  And I want to be clear here before I get into this.
[00:42:06.731 --> 00:42:12.212]  They've gone from being hysterical and fearful and craven on the news.
[00:42:12.212 --> 00:42:13.933]  I've been watching body language and statements.
[00:42:14.949 --> 00:42:19.472]  To now being committed and being back on a power trip, and criminals love to tell.
[00:42:19.472 --> 00:42:39.447]  So watching the Situation Room last night with their fill-in host, the whole roundtable of little minion insiders admitted that there's going to be a new giant war in the Middle East, if they can, to be blamed on Trump, and that they're going to have the media blame the economic collapse and the carnage that's going to come, I guess, in the next 20 days or so, if they have their way, will be blamed on Trump.
[00:42:42.165 --> 00:42:46.609]  And they were on the Situation Room going, I'm going to find the clips.
[00:42:46.609 --> 00:42:48.651]  I guess it's just going to be his fault this giant war.
[00:42:48.651 --> 00:42:50.012]  Yes, so be it.
[00:42:50.012 --> 00:42:50.573]  It's his fault.
[00:42:50.573 --> 00:42:55.598]  And they would all lean forward and look down like they're planning something really bad.
[00:42:55.598 --> 00:43:01.043]  I was watching hardcore slime who looked like they were, again, criminals in a bunker.
[00:43:03.536 --> 00:43:04.957]  About to know they're about to be dug out.
[00:43:04.957 --> 00:43:07.178]  I mean, they're going to pull some desperate crap.
[00:43:07.178 --> 00:43:12.260]  They know that they are playing Russian roulette, literally.
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:25.167]  And now's the time to be praying, folks, because look at the photo, the recent photo of George Soros looking like he's an undead, reanimated corpse-sickle.
[00:43:25.167 --> 00:43:28.708]  Looked like he was hamburger meat left in the refrigerator for about three years.
[00:43:28.708 --> 00:43:32.010]  He looks worse than Emperor Palpatine in Revenge of the Sith.
[00:43:34.031 --> 00:43:38.194]  And all he wants to do is take the world with him, and he's got to be stopped.
[00:43:38.194 --> 00:43:39.015]  He's got to be stopped.
[00:43:39.015 --> 00:43:40.096]  He's a clear and present danger.
[00:43:40.096 --> 00:43:41.397]  He's got to be stopped.
[00:43:41.397 --> 00:43:42.718]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:43:42.718 --> 00:43:49.424]  They're hitting the panic button saying, shut me down, shut Drudge down, shut... How about you get shut down?
[00:43:49.424 --> 00:43:51.645]  You're the one calling to shut down our free country.
[00:43:51.645 --> 00:43:55.709]  How about you, a foreign dirty Nazi collaborator, get out of the way?
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.181]  I don't have any personal hatred for Soros.
[00:43:59.181 --> 00:44:06.584]  He should go live in one of his palaces and just live out the last days of his life, you know, playing with his cats or something.
[00:44:06.584 --> 00:44:07.824]  He's not doing that.
[00:44:07.824 --> 00:44:14.907]  He's got this big heart on for America, and he thinks he's better than us, and he thought he'd be the guy to mount our head on the wall.
[00:44:14.907 --> 00:44:18.348]  It don't work that way, son!
[00:44:18.348 --> 00:44:22.330]  God loves children, drunks, and the United States of America.
[00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:23.090]  To quote Bismarck.
[00:44:24.881 --> 00:44:27.184]  And you think you can run up against that Providence?
[00:44:27.184 --> 00:44:32.550]  You don't have the real birthright, Jack, and you know it.
[00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:43.622]  So you want to try to come up against a country and a republic and a system, like the UK and the United States, that have the birthright?
[00:44:43.622 --> 00:44:44.903]  And you want to try to overthrow it?
[00:44:44.903 --> 00:44:45.965]  You're going to lose!
[00:44:49.175 --> 00:44:51.938]  George Soros, you rounded up and killed Jews.
[00:44:51.938 --> 00:44:55.301]  England, during the Dark Ages, saved the Jews.
[00:44:55.301 --> 00:44:56.742]  America saved the Jews.
[00:44:56.742 --> 00:44:58.584]  You kill the Jews!
[00:44:58.584 --> 00:44:59.986]  You don't have a birthright!
[00:44:59.986 --> 00:45:01.287]  You want to get down to brass tacks?
[00:45:01.287 --> 00:45:02.488]  God hates you!
[00:45:02.488 --> 00:45:05.751]  Your father is the devil, and you know it!
[00:45:05.751 --> 00:45:09.255]  So get that through your fat brain, you little bastard!
[00:45:09.255 --> 00:45:09.615]  Excuse me.
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.040]  We should take him down off the screen.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:16.821]  It's hard to look at.
[00:45:16.821 --> 00:45:17.881]  It's him and Hillary Trigger Me.
[00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:18.261]  They do.
[00:45:18.261 --> 00:45:19.261]  They do.
[00:45:19.261 --> 00:45:20.082]  These are demons.
[00:45:20.082 --> 00:45:22.262]  These are people out to get everybody.
[00:45:22.262 --> 00:45:23.122]  They're bad.
[00:45:23.122 --> 00:45:24.963]  They're not going to let us coexist with them.
[00:45:24.963 --> 00:45:31.765]  Has anybody figured that out yet?
[00:45:31.765 --> 00:45:33.685]  Now, let's continue.
[00:45:33.685 --> 00:45:35.126]  Let's read what this monster's put out.
[00:45:35.802 --> 00:45:41.505]  Soros, Trump is a world would-be dictator who threatens the New World Order.
[00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:42.866]  That's his world government.
[00:45:42.866 --> 00:45:51.550]  His stinking, anti-human, pro-death, eugenics-based tree of turds.
[00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:55.913]  Billionaire globalist George Soros has penned a panic rant in which he
[00:45:57.318 --> 00:46:00.899]  He decries President-elect Donald Trump as a would-be dictator.
[00:46:00.899 --> 00:46:09.401]  This is the guy that told magazines and newspapers in the 80s that he believed he was the new Christ and a messianic leader, but didn't want to tell people because he thought they'd lock him up in a mental institution.
[00:46:09.401 --> 00:46:10.282]  These are quotes.
[00:46:10.282 --> 00:46:12.702]  This guy thinks he's Jesus Christ.
[00:46:12.702 --> 00:46:14.783]  No, you're not Jesus Christ, brother.
[00:46:14.783 --> 00:46:15.303]  You're a demon.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:36.832]  In an article for Project Syndicate, Soros begins by mentioning how he lived under both Nazi and Soviet rule in Hungary before asserting that various forms of closed societies, from fascist dictatorships to mafia states, are on the rise.
[00:46:36.832 --> 00:46:44.076]  This is the guy in the WikiLeaks that wants to overthrow the free press and have people he disagrees with put in jail.
[00:46:44.076 --> 00:46:46.458]  Oh, he wants to stop a mafia state.
[00:46:46.458 --> 00:46:47.779]  Everything he says is a lie.
[00:46:48.854 --> 00:46:57.621]  The claim is confounded by the facts which show that the share of the world population living in democracies has increased continuously.
[00:46:57.621 --> 00:47:15.274]  Soros writes that in voting for Trump, Americans elected a con artist and would-be dictator as its president, and that his defeat of Hillary Clinton means America will be, quote, unable to protect and promote democracy in the rest of the world because that policy works so well in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Libya, which he's been behind.
[00:47:16.363 --> 00:47:24.392]  Toros also slammed Trump's new cabinet as containing nothing other than incompetent extremists and retired generals.
[00:47:24.392 --> 00:47:31.881]  Oh yeah, top salesmen, top engineers, top scientists, top go-getters, who all came from nothing.
[00:47:33.368 --> 00:47:37.290]  Notice the people in Trump's cabinet made their wealth themselves.
[00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:42.133]  Rex Tillerson was an engineer in the Texas oil fields the year I was born.
[00:47:42.133 --> 00:47:48.517]  He went to work 1974, 43 years ago.
[00:47:48.517 --> 00:47:53.380]  He is the most successful oil executive ever.
[00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:58.262]  He defeated the carbon taxes behind the scenes.
[00:47:58.262 --> 00:48:00.143]  People go, but he's in the newspapers for it.
[00:48:01.693 --> 00:48:03.914]  Just watch what happens when he gets in.
[00:48:03.914 --> 00:48:06.695]  I know the inside baseball, and I know what happened in 2006.
[00:48:06.695 --> 00:48:08.016]  It was in the newspapers.
[00:48:08.016 --> 00:48:18.540]  He took Standard Oil from the Rockefeller family in a hostile takeover when they tried to unseat him because he was the main financier exposing the plan to cut off the carbon here in the U.S.
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:22.222]  and in Russia, and he educated Putin on the plan, and that's why Putin's fighting it.
[00:48:23.134 --> 00:48:25.035]  Putin listens to Rex Tillerson!
[00:48:25.035 --> 00:48:26.776]  Putin listens to Alex Jones!
[00:48:26.776 --> 00:48:27.957]  Not the other way around!
[00:48:27.957 --> 00:48:29.638]  And I don't say that to brag!
[00:48:29.638 --> 00:48:31.319]  We want to build Russia up!
[00:48:31.319 --> 00:48:32.580]  We want Russia to be great!
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:33.580]  We want commerce!
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:34.621]  We want to be great!
[00:48:34.621 --> 00:48:37.022]  We want everybody to be great!
[00:48:37.022 --> 00:48:39.804]  We want progress and prosperity and renaissance!
[00:48:39.804 --> 00:48:41.925]  Not a death culture like Soros!
[00:48:41.925 --> 00:48:43.226]  We're pro-life!
[00:48:43.226 --> 00:48:45.387]  We're pro-family!
[00:48:45.387 --> 00:48:46.088]  We're here to help!
[00:48:48.257 --> 00:48:50.718]  Get it straight!
[00:48:50.718 --> 00:48:51.598]  1776 worldwide!
[00:48:51.598 --> 00:48:53.999]  It ain't the Russians doing this!
[00:48:53.999 --> 00:48:56.780]  It's the rise of the Republic!
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:59.080]  You won't kill it, you little slimebag!
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:03.542]  It's only the point you put the knife to our throat that the spirit of the Republic rose!
[00:49:03.542 --> 00:49:10.884]  And the more power you're given by your father, Soros, the more power we're going to be given to defeat you!
[00:49:10.884 --> 00:49:14.525]  You can see how we're all becoming animated, stronger, more prescient, more focused.
[00:49:14.525 --> 00:49:16.206]  It's because the enemy's rising right now!
[00:49:17.219 --> 00:49:20.963]  And as the enemy rises, God's spirit comes in to meet it.
[00:49:20.963 --> 00:49:25.088]  These are incredible times, magical times to be alive, my friends.
[00:49:25.088 --> 00:49:28.071]  George Soros.
[00:49:28.071 --> 00:49:33.537]  He is only there to test us and make us go to the next level.
[00:49:37.566 --> 00:49:42.189]  Soros writes that in voting for Trump, Americans elected a con artist and a would-be dictator as president.
[00:49:42.189 --> 00:49:45.691]  You're a proven con artist and guy that rounded up families to murder him.
[00:49:45.691 --> 00:49:48.553]  You're a proven murdering scumbag.
[00:49:48.553 --> 00:49:54.456]  And then his defeat of Hillary Clinton means America will be unable to protect and promote democracy in the rest of the world, something he overthrows everywhere.
[00:49:54.456 --> 00:49:59.539]  He overthrew an elected government in Ukraine and bragged about it.
[00:50:01.647 --> 00:50:05.255]  This is the guy funding the pro-cop killing groups.
[00:50:05.255 --> 00:50:11.929]  Soros also slams Trump's new cabinet as containing nothing other than incompetent extremists and retired generals.
[00:50:11.929 --> 00:50:12.390]  Hell yeah!
[00:50:14.158 --> 00:50:17.160]  Tell you what's incompetent is being a Nazi collaborator, boy.
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:26.826]  Explaining how he supports the European Union because its successful attempt to social engineering, that's a close quote, yeah, ending sovereignty, ending culture.
[00:50:26.826 --> 00:50:37.414]  Soros laments the fact that the body has become increasingly dysfunctional and its disintegration has been accelerated, first from Brexit, we're quoting him, then from the election of Trump in the U.S.
[00:50:37.414 --> 00:50:41.957]  on December 4th, from Italian voters, rejection by a wide margin of constitutional reforms.
[00:50:42.617 --> 00:50:43.758]  And he goes on to panic.
[00:50:43.758 --> 00:50:45.979]  Don't you understand, evil one?
[00:50:45.979 --> 00:50:49.080]  The transmissions have been sent!
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:55.243]  The truth is out there and only now do you begin to realize the giant is rising!
[00:50:55.243 --> 00:50:58.564]  Only now do you begin to fear!
[00:50:58.564 --> 00:50:59.265]  Only now!
[00:51:01.343 --> 00:51:06.124]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[00:51:06.124 --> 00:51:12.005]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[00:51:12.005 --> 00:51:18.506]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[00:51:18.506 --> 00:51:22.547]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[00:51:28.808 --> 00:51:30.548]  That's MinutemanStove.com.
[00:51:31.088 --> 00:51:32.988]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:51:32.988 --> 00:51:36.209]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[00:51:36.209 --> 00:51:37.809]  Savory and delicious.
[00:51:37.809 --> 00:51:40.630]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:41.310]  Awesome!
[00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:44.391]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[00:51:44.391 --> 00:51:45.951]  NASA PAC Technology.
[00:51:45.951 --> 00:51:46.571]  Bacon.
[00:51:46.571 --> 00:51:50.732]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[00:51:50.732 --> 00:51:52.152]  Or warm and served.
[00:51:52.152 --> 00:51:54.213]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:51:54.213 --> 00:51:56.153]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[00:51:58.934 --> 00:52:00.234]  FullyCookedBacon.com.
[00:52:04.392 --> 00:52:06.072]  Good day, America.
[00:52:06.072 --> 00:52:09.073]  Are you tired of your butt cheeks being frozen?
[00:52:09.073 --> 00:52:11.474]  Tired of cold hands or cold feet?
[00:52:11.474 --> 00:52:12.994]  I'm tired of the cold.
[00:52:12.994 --> 00:52:15.014]  Well, there's a new kid on the block.
[00:52:15.014 --> 00:52:16.715]  It's Fortress Clothing.
[00:52:16.715 --> 00:52:18.835]  Fortress will keep you warm.
[00:52:18.835 --> 00:52:22.396]  Fortress does what no other clothing company has ever done.
[00:52:22.396 --> 00:52:25.917]  We keep you warm in the cold, even when wet.
[00:52:25.917 --> 00:52:26.917]  You heard that right.

[00:54:05.585 --> 00:54:10.010]  Oh Lordy, my troubles so hard.
[00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:14.414]  Don't nobody know my troubles with God.
[00:54:14.414 --> 00:54:18.138]  Don't nobody know my troubles with God.
[00:54:19.799 --> 00:54:27.785]  Don't nobody know my troubles but God.
[00:54:27.785 --> 00:54:31.828]  Don't nobody know my troubles but God.
[00:54:36.371 --> 00:54:37.031]  All right.
[00:54:37.031 --> 00:54:39.073]  I've got a lot of news I haven't gotten to, obviously.
[00:54:39.073 --> 00:54:42.755]  Roger Stone was staying up for months, not getting any sleep.
[00:54:42.755 --> 00:54:43.756]  He's been sick for a week.
[00:54:43.756 --> 00:54:44.256]  He's better.
[00:54:44.256 --> 00:54:47.098]  He's popping in at the start of the third hour.
[00:54:47.098 --> 00:54:53.682]  Then Leanne McAdoo and others are going to come in about all the big Islamist surges taking place.
[00:54:53.682 --> 00:55:02.628]  The reports out of Spanish intelligence that the United States, Central America, Latin America, South America are just being flooded by jihadists right now.
[00:55:03.584 --> 00:55:06.866]  We already know that, but now it's mainstream news.
[00:55:06.866 --> 00:55:08.567]  There's a larger plan here with the globalists.
[00:55:08.567 --> 00:55:14.871]  It doesn't mean that we're even winning this fight, but we're conscious, we're gaining ground every day.
[00:55:14.871 --> 00:55:21.075]  He goes on to compare him to Hitler and says he hasn't felt this unsafe since he was in Hungary under Hitler.
[00:55:21.075 --> 00:55:28.620]  This is again a Nazi collaborator who actually rounded up thousands of people and sent them to death camps.
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:30.061]  But the ADL gives him awards.
[00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:34.672]  See, how do you, if you're going to cover all this up, how do you do it?
[00:55:34.672 --> 00:55:37.754]  You become the group that represents the people!
[00:55:37.754 --> 00:55:41.997]  Isn't that just cute?
[00:55:41.997 --> 00:55:52.285]  It continues, at first, Mrs. Soros also bemoans Russian President Vladimir Putin's alleged unique influence during the presidential election.
[00:55:52.285 --> 00:55:56.648]  Oh yeah, again, for me the big scandal is, all these foreign powers got involved,
[00:55:57.768 --> 00:56:05.851]  And Trump's not coming out and going, the Communist Chinese, the Saudi Arabians admittedly gave Hillary 20% of her campaign money alone, just from Saudi Arabia.
[00:56:05.851 --> 00:56:07.311]  China was more!
[00:56:07.311 --> 00:56:11.092]  Through thousands of illegal subsidiaries here in the U.S.
[00:56:11.092 --> 00:56:12.673]  There's the total proof!
[00:56:12.673 --> 00:56:17.534]  But no, no, no, the Russians are just all-powerful!
[00:56:17.534 --> 00:56:19.555]  At first, he tried to control social media.
[00:56:19.555 --> 00:56:26.617]  Then, in a brilliant move, he exploited social media companies, business models to spread misinformation, fake news, distorting
[00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:29.992]  Electorates and he's stabilizing democracies.
[00:56:29.992 --> 00:56:32.233]  This is how he helped Trump get elected, right?
[00:56:32.233 --> 00:56:34.795]  Soros, about Trump.
[00:56:34.795 --> 00:56:36.196]  He's talking about himself.
[00:56:36.196 --> 00:56:39.199]  Soros is in thousands of the WikiLeaks.
[00:56:39.199 --> 00:56:44.203]  His group manipulated CNN, ABC, CBS, all of them.
[00:56:44.203 --> 00:56:47.625]  And Hillary going, we gotta do what Soros says.
[00:56:47.625 --> 00:56:50.648]  Oh, but now you see, it's the Russians.
[00:56:50.648 --> 00:56:51.809]  He's talking about himself here.
[00:56:52.745 --> 00:56:54.786]  That's what's so crazy about this devil.
[00:56:54.786 --> 00:56:56.287]  So you just, whatever he says, it's backwards.
[00:56:56.287 --> 00:56:59.410]  They say Satanists learn to read backwards, do things backwards.
[00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:01.471]  This is Satanism in action.
[00:57:01.471 --> 00:57:06.835]  War, death, overthrowing, targeting Christians, calling people Nazis when you're a Nazi.
[00:57:06.835 --> 00:57:08.756]  Inversing everything.
[00:57:08.756 --> 00:57:09.997]  Inverting everything.
[00:57:09.997 --> 00:57:13.299]  Soros says Putin felt threatened by color revolutions.
[00:57:13.299 --> 00:57:15.641]  Yeah, he was murdering, trying to overthrow Russia.
[00:57:15.641 --> 00:57:17.002]  So they're fighting you there, not here.
[00:57:17.958 --> 00:57:25.864]  In Georgia, Ukraine, and elsewhere, without mentioning that Soros himself played a key role in bankrolling these contrived uprisings, as well as color revolutions being fomented against Trump.
[00:57:25.864 --> 00:57:35.952]  The irony of an ultra-rich elitist who has bankrolled the following and the overthrow of innumerable governments, insisting he cares about democracy and the will of the people, is particularly rich.
[00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:42.698]  Yeah, we need to get the raw video of him saying the best time of his life was rounding up Jews, and we're going to add that to this article.
[00:57:43.755 --> 00:57:53.242]  He concludes by a warning that the EU is on the verge of breakdown due to stagnant economic growth and the out-of-control refugee crisis that Soros himself admittedly quarterbacked.
[00:57:53.242 --> 00:57:56.084]  I mean, you cannot make this up!
[00:57:56.084 --> 00:57:58.565]  Total inversion!
[00:57:58.565 --> 00:58:01.788]  Now, before I go any further, we need your support.
[00:58:01.788 --> 00:58:03.629]  We're hair on fire going in against the enemy.
[00:58:03.629 --> 00:58:05.410]  We've got the most amazing nutraceuticals.
[00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:09.393]  If you don't try Supramel Vitality or Female Vitality or X2, you're nuts.
[00:58:09.393 --> 00:58:10.994]  And we've got free shipping store-wide.
[00:58:10.994 --> 00:58:12.135]  Christmas is extended.
[00:58:13.721 --> 00:58:28.029]  Right through to New Year's Day, free shipping store-wide, and we're selling out basically of almost everything, it looks like, by Monday or so, because we like to sell at the end of the year, so we don't have inventory taxes that Texas has that are quite large and hefty.
[00:58:28.029 --> 00:58:39.536]  So you're getting great products, free shipping, time for auto-ship, an additional 10% off, a lot of other specials, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:58:39.536 --> 00:58:41.737]  We'll be back with our number two item.
[00:58:41.737 --> 00:58:42.438]  Fire it up!
[00:58:43.098 --> 00:58:50.842]  I can feel the spirit of liberty rising!
[00:58:50.842 --> 00:58:55.325]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:58:55.325 --> 00:59:06.251]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:59:06.411 --> 00:59:11.454]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:59:11.454 --> 00:59:14.035]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:59:14.035 --> 00:59:15.536]  It helps detoxify.
[00:59:15.536 --> 00:59:18.638]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:59:18.638 --> 00:59:23.401]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:59:23.401 --> 00:59:29.664]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:59:29.664 --> 00:59:35.087]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:59:35.087 --> 00:59:35.748]  I'm taking it now.
[00:59:36.308 --> 00:59:38.189]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:12.213 --> 01:00:17.736]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[01:00:17.736 --> 01:00:31.143]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:31.143 --> 01:00:33.625]  21 days, ladies and gentlemen, until the historic election.
[01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:48.940]  I'm going to open the phones up in this hour on Obama with more talk of war, cyber attacks against Russia, saying our policy of Russia cyber attacks us under globalist control, that they'll physically attack them, so that means turnabout's fair play.
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:52.362]  Major economic sanctions, Soros going into panic mode.
[01:00:52.362 --> 01:00:57.826]  If you just joined us saying that Trump's a dictator, a Hitlerian dictator, these are quotes.
[01:01:00.435 --> 01:01:03.337]  When this guy is a literal former Nazi agent.
[01:01:03.337 --> 01:01:05.780]  I mean, it's just, it's too rich.
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:10.443]  He claims that Trump's going to destabilize the world and overthrow countries, when that's what Soros does.
[01:01:10.443 --> 01:01:22.774]  Alright, there is so much to get to here today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:22.774 --> 01:01:25.696]  Terrorists are raising cash in Latin America to attack the United States.
[01:01:26.459 --> 01:01:27.860]  We're gonna be getting into all of that.
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:30.301]  Roger Stone hasn't been on in about a week or more.
[01:01:30.301 --> 01:01:32.663]  He's gonna be on.
[01:01:32.663 --> 01:01:36.285]  He's been burrowed in writing his book.
[01:01:36.285 --> 01:01:37.245]  There's so much to cover.
[01:01:37.245 --> 01:01:43.069]  We've got pro-white genocide professor given no punishment despite saying massacre of whites a good thing.
[01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:44.429]  Because they agree with it.
[01:01:44.429 --> 01:01:46.711]  Mainstream media, some of them actually endorsed this.
[01:01:46.711 --> 01:01:48.352]  And it's all weirdo white people doing.
[01:01:49.189 --> 01:01:55.694]  I'm a little Soros-type, like this Drexel University professor, Mr. Mayor.
[01:01:55.694 --> 01:01:59.617]  George Cicerello, is that how you say it?
[01:01:59.617 --> 01:02:01.258]  Mayor.
[01:02:01.258 --> 01:02:04.340]  Very, very proud of himself.
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:14.408]  This is all they've got, just total culture warfare, so this parasite class can just sit there getting their paychecks, giving you worthless degrees that you literally won't be able to get a job with, if you're lucky.
[01:02:14.408 --> 01:02:17.430]  You know what you get jobs with?
[01:02:18.632 --> 01:02:21.935]  Construction.
[01:02:21.935 --> 01:02:23.296]  Engineering.
[01:02:23.296 --> 01:02:23.876]  Medical stuff.
[01:02:23.876 --> 01:02:28.701]  Yeah, there's a few things you can go to college and get degrees in that are worth it.
[01:02:28.701 --> 01:02:35.166]  Certainly not sitting at the feet of some intellectual joke who can't even get a job in the real world, probably can't even wipe his own butt.
[01:02:35.166 --> 01:02:37.428]  I bet this guy doesn't even wipe his ass.
[01:02:37.428 --> 01:02:37.848]  I'm sorry.
[01:02:37.848 --> 01:02:39.770]  I don't know why I'm saying that.
[01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:41.011]  You know, they stink.
[01:02:41.011 --> 01:02:42.512]  These kind of guys want to stink.
[01:02:42.512 --> 01:02:44.033]  They want to make you unhappy.
[01:02:44.033 --> 01:02:45.935]  They want to, you know how they are.
[01:02:45.935 --> 01:02:46.876]  You know how these people are.
[01:02:48.334 --> 01:02:51.396]  Ugly, hunchback, spiritually hunchback.
[01:02:51.396 --> 01:02:53.658]  It's the old folks that have hunchbacks, you know what I mean?
[01:02:53.658 --> 01:02:55.880]  They're just, you know, demons.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.320]  And they are.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.022]  I mean, there's just no end to it.
[01:02:58.022 --> 01:03:00.404]  He wants to kill you and your family, according to him.
[01:03:00.404 --> 01:03:07.269]  He's dreaming of you and your family dead, your children lined up, their throats slit, hanging by their frickin' feet.
[01:03:07.269 --> 01:03:08.190]  So he can feel powerful.
[01:03:10.029 --> 01:03:11.169]  Oh, but he's not going to do the killing.
[01:03:11.169 --> 01:03:25.473]  He's just going to hype it up like Time Magazine and Newsweek, and then when cops get shot in the back of the head changing tires or pumping gas or giving somebody a ticket, these little guys go on the news and say, well, cops better readjust themselves and do what we say or more are going to die.
[01:03:25.473 --> 01:03:27.894]  Yeah, you don't do the killing yourself, do you, buddy?
[01:03:28.865 --> 01:03:41.638]  Well let me tell you, you get your civil war kicked off like you really want to, we've affected the battle space, then if that happens, we don't want it to happen, people like you are gonna get your butts handed to you real nice.
[01:03:41.638 --> 01:03:43.200]  Oh, you wanna fight?
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.662]  You wanna be in a man's world, huh?
[01:03:45.662 --> 01:03:47.564]  You fantasize about death, do ya?
[01:03:47.564 --> 01:03:49.326]  And genocide, do ya?
[01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:50.687]  You like that kind of stuff, hmm?
[01:03:51.476 --> 01:04:00.398]  Well, those of us that really instinctively, spiritually, historically, or by experience know all about mass death, don't like it.
[01:04:00.398 --> 01:04:06.599]  But we sure know how to deal it.
[01:04:06.599 --> 01:04:11.579]  You're entering a man's world now, son.
[01:04:11.579 --> 01:04:17.240]  I guarantee you, this cretin doesn't know why his life's so horrible, why such bad things happen to him, why nobody likes him.
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.501]  It's because you're scum.
[01:04:19.501 --> 01:04:20.581]  God doesn't like you.
[01:04:22.073 --> 01:04:28.560]  That's why you try to act like a man and try to act impressive and try to shoot your mouth off about death.
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:32.283]  Well, I'm sure death will visit you one day.
[01:04:32.283 --> 01:04:33.625]  Maybe sooner than you think.
[01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:37.626]  It's bad luck what you're doing, boy.
[01:04:37.626 --> 01:04:43.429]  To come back, we're gonna get into all this and a lot more, and take your phone calls.
[01:04:43.429 --> 01:04:44.389]  At 800-259-9231.
[01:04:44.389 --> 01:04:45.690]  First-time callers today.
[01:04:45.690 --> 01:04:49.932]  All I ask is you have a good phone, and not drink too much cough syrup before you call.
[01:04:49.932 --> 01:04:49.992]  800-259-9231.
[01:04:49.992 --> 01:04:52.273]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is The Info War.
[01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:03.479]  A heartbreaking update this morning.
[01:05:03.479 --> 01:05:08.283]  Debbie Reynolds, age 84, mother of Carrie Fisher, has died of a suspected stroke.
[01:05:08.283 --> 01:05:11.305]  Her last words, quote, I want to be with Carrie.
[01:05:11.305 --> 01:05:18.210]  Carrie Fisher, her famous daughter, Princess Leia, of course, died of a heart attack on a flight from London to LAX earlier this week.
[01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:23.355]  Debbie Reynolds died this morning, hours after suffering a stroke, at her son Todd Fisher's house.
[01:05:23.355 --> 01:05:27.598]  The 84-year-old was planning her daughter's funeral when she suddenly took ill around 1 p.m.
[01:05:27.598 --> 01:05:28.218]  in the afternoon.
[01:05:28.218 --> 01:05:28.839]  She was rushed
[01:05:28.939 --> 01:05:34.683]  From their house in Beverly Hills to a nearby hospital, but died shortly thereafter, her son later revealed.
[01:05:34.683 --> 01:05:42.628]  Now, Todd, the last family member remaining, said that his sister's death was just simply too much for his mother, and she died longing to be with her daughter.
[01:05:42.628 --> 01:05:47.211]  Carrie Fisher died on Tuesday, four days after a heart attack on board a flight.
[01:05:47.211 --> 01:05:53.495]  And the Star Wars actress, she was in the middle of promoting her memoirs, The Diarist, and she was thought to be in good health.
[01:05:53.495 --> 01:05:54.376]  Here's what we know.
[01:05:54.376 --> 01:05:55.997]  Debbie Reynolds has died, age 84.
[01:05:55.997 --> 01:05:58.679]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for InfoWars.
[01:06:00.799 --> 01:06:08.701]  All across the Western world, MSM is attempting to demonize the language and words we use, saying, don't say Merry Christmas, use holidays.
[01:06:08.701 --> 01:06:10.282]  And now they say, don't use holiday.
[01:06:10.282 --> 01:06:11.722]  Well, I got some news for them.
[01:06:11.722 --> 01:06:19.104]  We're going to continue to use the speech we feel like using, and we're going to exercise the First Amendment in your globalist, tyrannical faces.
[01:06:19.384 --> 01:06:24.688]  And that's why I'm extending the Christmas sale this year right through into the start of 2017.

[01:07:00.512 --> 01:07:02.393]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:04.433]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:07:04.433 --> 01:07:07.335]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:07:07.335 --> 01:07:13.397]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:07:13.397 --> 01:07:22.580]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:27.442]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[01:07:27.662 --> 01:07:30.125]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:07:30.125 --> 01:07:38.155]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:07:38.155 --> 01:07:39.117]  The general public doesn't.
[01:07:40.317 --> 01:07:43.699]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:07:43.699 --> 01:07:47.842]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:07:47.842 --> 01:07:54.547]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:07:54.547 --> 01:07:58.670]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:08:16.089 --> 01:08:18.010]  We are on the march.
[01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:21.172]  The empire is on the run.
[01:08:21.172 --> 01:08:27.175]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:27.175 --> 01:08:32.137]  21 days until Trump's in office and they're openly trying to start a war with Russia.
[01:08:32.137 --> 01:08:36.019]  They're openly trying to get a civil war going in Israel.
[01:08:36.019 --> 01:08:40.401]  They're calling in newspapers for Trump to be killed but no one's getting in trouble.
[01:08:40.401 --> 01:08:43.403]  One guy that lived close to where the president's staying in Florida
[01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:50.616]  Got arrested because when they showed up at his house, he started basically screaming and yelling and saying, it's his right to say kill Trump.
[01:08:50.616 --> 01:08:54.279]  So they had him right there, he'll get convicted.
[01:08:54.279 --> 01:09:04.929]  But meanwhile, you've got professors all over the United States, including right here at UT.
[01:09:04.929 --> 01:09:09.714]  Where they're announcing communism in America, that white people are inherently bad, and most of them are white.
[01:09:11.462 --> 01:09:13.924]  This is what the big universities are paying to do.
[01:09:13.924 --> 01:09:18.207]  This is what the big foundations are paying to fund.
[01:09:18.207 --> 01:09:23.571]  This is what the elite want, to make us a bunch of dysfunctional mental patients.
[01:09:23.571 --> 01:09:28.814]  And then when the problem gets big, they bring in total federalization to counter all the racial division.
[01:09:28.814 --> 01:09:31.576]  Classic divide and conquer.
[01:09:31.576 --> 01:09:34.418]  Stories up on Infowars.com.
[01:09:34.418 --> 01:09:40.162]  Pro-white genocide professor given no punishment despite saying massacre of whites a good thing.
[01:09:40.162 --> 01:09:40.923]  He said, all I want
[01:09:42.108 --> 01:09:45.231]  Christmas is white genocide.
[01:09:45.231 --> 01:09:57.081]  Despite explicitly stating the massacre of white people during the bloody Haitian revolution was a good thing, and wishing for white genocide on Christmas Eve, Professor George Mayer said Drexel University supports him.
[01:09:57.081 --> 01:10:00.244]  And Reuters goes on to report from that.
[01:10:00.244 --> 01:10:05.849]  In fact, I have the Reuters article right here in my stack.
[01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:08.091]  Isn't that just cute?
[01:10:08.091 --> 01:10:20.665]  A Drexel University professor whose tweet that he wanted white genocide for Christmas sparked a firestorm of criticism from the School of Social Media, said on Tuesday that administrators supported his right to take part in political debate.
[01:10:22.924 --> 01:10:26.207]  Imagine if a professor said we should support black genocide.
[01:10:26.207 --> 01:10:29.891]  I mean, you would be fired so quick your head would spin.
[01:10:29.891 --> 01:10:38.438]  I mean, they've had liberal professors at Yale and a bunch of other places when they're calling for banning costume parties or banning fiesta parties.
[01:10:38.438 --> 01:10:40.901]  You know, Mexican food's good.
[01:10:40.901 --> 01:10:43.803]  When I went to college for a couple of years, I got invited to rush parties and stuff.
[01:10:43.803 --> 01:10:45.665]  I never joined any of it because I thought it was stupid.
[01:10:45.665 --> 01:10:47.347]  Not bashing if you're in a fraternity, just whatever.
[01:10:48.183 --> 01:10:51.104]  I mean, there's nothing against the sorority girls being there, whatever, that was fun, drink beer, whatever.
[01:10:51.104 --> 01:10:54.625]  And I mean, the most common party was Fiesta.
[01:10:54.625 --> 01:11:00.587]  Because it's fun to drink margaritas and eat Mexican food and run around with sombreros on your head and jump in the pool.
[01:11:00.587 --> 01:11:04.128]  I mean, it's fun, and that's why people do it.
[01:11:04.128 --> 01:11:07.509]  The Mexicans invented it all because it's fun, you know?
[01:11:07.509 --> 01:11:09.569]  Nobody says the Mexicans don't know how to have fun, they do.
[01:11:12.691 --> 01:11:14.432]  This is just, I mean, that's not racist.
[01:11:14.432 --> 01:11:16.314]  Well, they've banned that all over.
[01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:19.116]  And this is just the insanity.
[01:11:19.116 --> 01:11:20.297]  Oh, I guess what else?
[01:11:20.297 --> 01:11:24.000]  You have toga parties, so folks are kind of lightly dressed.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.422]  Oh, that's expropriating stuff from the Greeks.
[01:11:26.422 --> 01:11:28.023]  You're putting the Greeks down when you do that.
[01:11:28.023 --> 01:11:29.244]  Oh, so let's not be Greeks.
[01:11:29.244 --> 01:11:30.645]  And don't be a cowboy either.
[01:11:30.645 --> 01:11:34.548]  All over the country, they say, that's cultural appropriation.
[01:11:34.548 --> 01:11:38.291]  You should say, I didn't, I'm not paying $30,000 a year to be in a cult.
[01:11:39.264 --> 01:11:45.749]  That tells me that I can't be a Native American or a cowboy, or that I can't be a geisha girl.
[01:11:45.749 --> 01:11:56.156]  I know people, well it's come out in the news, and in one case Eastside Yoga, I was talking to one of my friends, whose girlfriend's a yoga instructor, I heard about this and it ended up being in the paper.
[01:11:56.156 --> 01:11:58.838]  A couple years ago, they said,
[01:12:00.575 --> 01:12:05.116]  We're going to have for Halloween a yoga party with wine and stuff like that.
[01:12:05.116 --> 01:12:08.516]  And we're going to come dressed, you know, like India style.
[01:12:08.516 --> 01:12:10.037]  Well, it's Indian culture.
[01:12:10.037 --> 01:12:12.057]  It's an Indian exercise.
[01:12:12.057 --> 01:12:14.897]  It's and so it's kind of like you're going to a dude ranch.
[01:12:14.897 --> 01:12:22.559]  Come dressed with your cowboy boots, your cowboy hat and your and your and your, you know, go to Shepler's or whatever Western store you go to and get dressed up like that.
[01:12:22.559 --> 01:12:23.819]  You're not bashing cowboys.
[01:12:23.819 --> 01:12:25.159]  You're not bashing anybody.
[01:12:25.159 --> 01:12:26.399]  It's just what you do.
[01:12:26.399 --> 01:12:27.880]  And they had a bunch of folks flip out.
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:28.440]  So you can't do it.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:29.280]  So they canceled it.
[01:12:30.717 --> 01:12:35.300]  It's all about control, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:42.425]  Oh, you don't dress up in Indian garb and don't have girls belly dancing, whatever you do, just shut it down!
[01:12:42.425 --> 01:12:47.389]  Because the cult rules things.
[01:12:47.389 --> 01:12:59.418]  A Drexel University professor whose tweet that he wanted white genocide for Christmas sparked a firestorm of criticism from the school and social media said on Tuesday the administrator supported his right to take part in political debate.
[01:13:00.299 --> 01:13:13.501]  George Mayer, a white associate professor of history at the politics at Philadelphia University, has said his Christmas Eve posting that all I want for Christmas is white genocide on Twitter was aimed at poking fun at white supremacists.
[01:13:13.501 --> 01:13:16.522]  Oh, so it's okay.
[01:13:16.522 --> 01:13:21.223]  Even though they do call for an end of white people all over the major universities and have it in official textbooks.
[01:13:21.223 --> 01:13:25.124]  When I took two years of community college, thinking about if I wanted to go to college.
[01:13:25.124 --> 01:13:27.584]  I was already successful in radio by that time I got out of it.
[01:13:28.965 --> 01:13:33.149]  It didn't matter whether it was psychology class or whatever, they would come in and hold up a picture of a brown person.
[01:13:33.149 --> 01:13:37.072]  They'd look like any particular group and say, it's going to be wonderful that soon whites will be gone.
[01:13:37.072 --> 01:13:38.634]  Whites are inherently bad.
[01:13:38.634 --> 01:13:39.955]  At ACC, I would sit there.
[01:13:39.955 --> 01:13:41.076]  That's why I got out of college.
[01:13:42.281 --> 01:13:48.487]  And if I wrote papers in psychology or Texas history or whatever I had to take, countering that, I would get Fs.
[01:13:48.487 --> 01:13:55.834]  So I would write these things with errors all over them as a joke, agreeing with all of it, and they would give me A pluses and invite me for coffee.
[01:13:55.834 --> 01:13:57.636]  I'm not kidding.
[01:13:57.636 --> 01:14:02.261]  And they didn't care I'd done 180 about faces from paper to paper.
[01:14:04.767 --> 01:14:07.091]  They like the fact that I've submitted.
[01:14:07.091 --> 01:14:14.862]  I mean, I would write stuff that you couldn't hardly read on purpose, and they would give me A+.
[01:14:14.862 --> 01:14:16.905]  This is a cult of sickening scum!
[01:14:20.814 --> 01:14:22.996]  They want to teach 2 plus 2 equals 5, folks.
[01:14:22.996 --> 01:14:30.304]  They want basket cases that only know how to be hurt and feel weird and scared, so they go into the wings of these parasites.
[01:14:30.304 --> 01:14:33.287]  Oh, come here, I'll protect you since everyone's out to get you.
[01:14:33.287 --> 01:14:41.235]  So you can't even get a job, you've got so many chips on your shoulder, you're so neurotic, and you're led by little twits with their little ironic
[01:14:42.409 --> 01:14:46.331]  Colonel Sanders beard and mustaches to teach you how bad whites are.
[01:14:46.331 --> 01:14:52.115]  And then when you get caught doing it, you slime out and go, oh, I was just countering white supremacists.
[01:14:52.115 --> 01:14:53.595]  Oh, kill all the white people.
[01:14:53.595 --> 01:14:59.018]  Now it's okay.
[01:14:59.018 --> 01:15:03.281]  Here's an excerpt on Latin American social movements with almost 10,000 Twitter followers.
[01:15:07.193 --> 01:15:09.574]  And then it goes through all the crazy statements they've made.
[01:15:09.574 --> 01:15:16.796]  But his attempt at satire triggering a backlash from conservative websites with some online comments calling for him to be fired or commit suicide.
[01:15:16.796 --> 01:15:22.918]  Drexel on Sunday called his tweet utterly reprehensible and said it would meet with him to discuss it.
[01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:26.259]  This is fake news.
[01:15:26.259 --> 01:15:30.681]  He explicitly clarified his comment to say the massacre of whites during the
[01:15:32.128 --> 01:15:34.349]  Haitian revolution was a good thing indeed.
[01:15:34.349 --> 01:15:35.169]  What does that mean?
[01:15:35.169 --> 01:15:38.950]  So now they're saying it's fake news if you say he said kill everybody.
[01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:40.830]  He said nothing about it, Haiti.
[01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:42.571]  But see, he controls reality.
[01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:45.312]  So now he's saying it's fake news.
[01:15:45.312 --> 01:15:47.412]  Oh, I said kill all the whites.
[01:15:47.412 --> 01:15:48.572]  I only meant in Haiti.
[01:15:48.572 --> 01:15:50.613]  And by the way, it's fake news if you talk about me.
[01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:58.491]  This is where they play this game like you're stupid, and talk to you like an idiot.
[01:15:58.491 --> 01:16:03.793]  And we've put up with so much in this country, and so much in Europe, and so much in other parts of the world, that I expect them to act like this.
[01:16:03.793 --> 01:16:06.053]  They still think you're totally in a coma.
[01:16:06.053 --> 01:16:07.394]  And some people are!
[01:16:07.394 --> 01:16:21.717]  Where George Soros comes out and says, Trump is gonna be a dictator like Hitler, and I'm more scared than when I was in Hungary, under Hitler, and he's a horrible person, and he's starting all these wars, and he's really, really racist, and everything Soros says is what he's done.
[01:16:21.717 --> 01:16:23.298]  It's everything he's the king of!
[01:16:24.827 --> 01:16:34.328]  And you won't see any MSM point out the hypocrisy because their job is to invert reality and teach you that prosperity is an evil thing.
[01:16:37.824 --> 01:16:46.727]  Now I'm going to go to break and come back and break all this down with Greg and John and Matt and Ward and a bunch of other folks that are patiently holding the toll-free number to join us.
[01:16:46.727 --> 01:16:46.987]  It's 800-259-9231.
[01:16:46.987 --> 01:16:51.688]  When you hear somebody hang up, that's your chance to call in.
[01:16:51.688 --> 01:16:55.809]  And I intend to go to your calls, bam, bam, bam, on the other side of this break.
[01:16:55.809 --> 01:17:03.151]  I want to just recap that Soros has conjured Hitler in an attack on ascendant populists all over the world.
[01:17:03.151 --> 01:17:05.032]  Every country that's getting a vote from Spain,
[01:17:06.263 --> 01:17:11.144]  to Italy, to the UK, is voting to begin the pullout of the unelected EU.
[01:17:11.144 --> 01:17:16.285]  And this little monster is panicking, calling it undemocratic, to pull out of something that's undemocratic.
[01:17:16.285 --> 01:17:17.865]  Total inversion of reality.
[01:17:17.865 --> 01:17:24.106]  Our story is up on DrugsReport.com, breaking it all down right now.
[01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:35.548]  So please, get that story out to everyone, and I'm gonna shoot a video that I'm gonna add into the article, pointing out the biblical level, incredible hypocrisy of all of this.
[01:17:40.009 --> 01:17:47.631]  But the easiest place to find our article is Soros Trump is a would-be dictator who threatens New World Order, their New World Order, which they say doesn't exist.
[01:17:47.631 --> 01:17:50.811]  Very important article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:17:50.811 --> 01:17:53.052]  Let's get that out on Facebook, Twitter, you name it.
[01:17:53.052 --> 01:17:54.152]  What a hypocrite.
[01:17:54.152 --> 01:17:55.992]  Breaks the record for being a hypocrite.
[01:17:55.992 --> 01:17:59.473]  Briefly, we are Lister-supported.
[01:17:59.473 --> 01:18:03.234]  The globalists, as you know, target sponsors, they shut you down, they go after you.
[01:18:03.234 --> 01:18:06.175]  I don't even list a full list of our AMNM affiliates anymore.
[01:18:06.175 --> 01:18:07.715]  I've decided that over a year ago and it's worked.
[01:18:08.635 --> 01:18:15.157]  We gained over 100 because the enemy is so stupid they can't even find our full affiliate list and then try to boycott them and attack them.
[01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:17.458]  Just little moves like that.
[01:18:17.458 --> 01:18:22.720]  But the point is, we've gone from like 170 to 250 plus and growing.
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:31.844]  But the point is, support those local stations, become a sponsor, let the sponsors know you're supporting them because they are a sponsor, and spread the word how folks can listen to the station.
[01:18:31.844 --> 01:18:32.224]  Send them 100 bucks.
[01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:34.921]  Also support us.
[01:18:34.921 --> 01:18:36.183]  Get the nutraceuticals.
[01:18:36.183 --> 01:18:37.044]  I mean, amazing.
[01:18:37.044 --> 01:18:38.426]  The good Halogen X2.
[01:18:38.426 --> 01:18:39.087]  Find out about it.
[01:18:39.087 --> 01:18:40.568]  It's the missing link.
[01:18:40.568 --> 01:18:41.770]  The other big missing link.
[01:18:41.770 --> 01:18:43.572]  Biotruselenium.
[01:18:43.572 --> 01:18:45.014]  Don't take too much of it, though, folks.
[01:18:45.014 --> 01:18:45.514]  It's amazing.
[01:18:46.297 --> 01:18:48.958]  A lot of people have big deficiencies in that.
[01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:51.980]  Super Mel Vitality is 30% off right now.
[01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:52.980]  It's about to sell out.
[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:54.561]  We don't get more for about a month.
[01:18:54.561 --> 01:19:00.424]  But I want to sell out before the end of the year, obviously, for tax reasons, because they have inventory taxes here in Texas.
[01:19:00.424 --> 01:19:02.445]  So, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:19:02.445 --> 01:19:06.306]  We have hundreds of items between 50 and 25% off.

[01:19:38.276 --> 01:19:42.177]  And funding revolutions against tyranny is just as important as being on air.
[01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:45.278]  So I salute you and thank you for making it all possible.
[01:19:45.278 --> 01:19:48.499]  Christmas is extended because they hate it so much.
[01:19:48.499 --> 01:19:52.241]  Right through to New Year's Day at InfowarStore.com.
[01:19:52.241 --> 01:19:53.461]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[01:19:53.461 --> 01:19:54.821]  These are amazing items.
[01:19:54.821 --> 01:19:55.782]  Check them out for yourself.
[01:19:55.782 --> 01:19:57.222]  There's so much we didn't mention.

[01:19:58.643 --> 01:19:59.063]  We'll be back.
[01:20:02.085 --> 01:20:03.686]  What's it going to take?
[01:20:03.686 --> 01:20:05.167]  Another news story?
[01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:07.729]  You've heard about Infidel Body Armor for years.
[01:20:07.729 --> 01:20:09.891]  You know you should have a set.
[01:20:09.891 --> 01:20:11.232]  So should your wife.
[01:20:11.232 --> 01:20:12.753]  Things aren't getting better.
[01:20:12.753 --> 01:20:14.114]  They're getting worse.
[01:20:14.114 --> 01:20:16.736]  Thousands already wear Infidel Body Armor.

[01:21:04.170 --> 01:21:05.830]  Good day, America.

[01:21:08.851 --> 01:21:11.252]  Tired of cold hands or cold feet?
[01:21:11.252 --> 01:21:12.772]  I'm tired of the cold.
[01:21:12.772 --> 01:21:14.792]  Well, there's a new kid on the block.

[01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:01.642]  My name is Robin.
[01:22:01.642 --> 01:22:03.483]  I'm 47 years of age.
[01:22:03.483 --> 01:22:06.224]  I absolutely love One World Whey.
[01:22:06.224 --> 01:22:11.286]  It was about five years ago when a trainer told me it was the end-all of protein powders.
[01:22:11.286 --> 01:22:14.627]  One day when I ran out, I decided to try other brands.
[01:22:14.627 --> 01:22:17.608]  I spent eight months and could not find a replacement.
[01:22:17.608 --> 01:22:20.809]  I went through tons of brands, types, and flavors, and almost all
[01:22:21.109 --> 01:22:24.070]  All of them tasted unnatural and not pleasant.
[01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:28.252]  When it all boiled down, I came right back to One World Way.
[01:22:28.252 --> 01:22:33.835]  I buy the cost-effective five-pound container and my family craves their One World Way, too.
[01:22:33.835 --> 01:22:39.177]  I look forward to and enjoy having my One World Way and feel great after I drink it.
[01:22:39.177 --> 01:22:45.080]  Thank you, Synergistic Nutrition, for perfecting a protein powder in the product One World Way.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:49.082]  From taste to how it makes me and my family feel, you get an A++.

[01:24:04.838 --> 01:24:09.821]  Alright, I want to go to your phone calls, but I want to just pull back here for just a moment.
[01:24:09.821 --> 01:24:12.002]  Because every time I'm about to go on air at 11 a.m.
[01:24:12.002 --> 01:24:27.671]  Central, and every time I get off here, when I'm walking to the bathroom, or going to look at some video clips in one of the studios, or stepping outside to make a phone call, I just think about the fact that the globalists are panicking, they're trying to start wars.
[01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:32.392]  They're openly passing laws to begin censorship of media in the U.S.
[01:24:32.392 --> 01:24:36.473]  They're claiming that American patriots that want sovereignty are Russian agents?
[01:24:36.473 --> 01:24:40.475]  When they're the ones bringing in foreign powers to suppress our speech?
[01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:55.282]  It's just incredible to me how truly criminal and despicable and villainous and comic book... I mean, this is like a James Bond movie.
[01:24:55.282 --> 01:24:56.302]  They're really doing it.
[01:24:57.483 --> 01:25:11.469]  They're really going to pull something big, because they've gone from looking butthurt now to looking really angry, focused, and evil, and they're nodding their heads, and they're saying something big's coming, Trump's gonna get it, he's gonna pay, oh, it's his fault, a big war is about to start.
[01:25:11.469 --> 01:25:21.973]  We were saying months ago they're gonna start a war if Trump gets elected, and now they're doing it, and now they're on TV saying the big war is about to happen, it's his fault, when anyone with the geopolitical understanding of a five-year-old
[01:25:24.224 --> 01:25:29.465]  understands they're starting stuff with this whole destabilization of Israel and Russia.
[01:25:29.465 --> 01:25:33.046]  It's just crazy.
[01:25:33.046 --> 01:25:34.327]  It's crazy!
[01:25:34.327 --> 01:25:35.647]  And I'm not on Trump's back.
[01:25:35.647 --> 01:25:39.408]  He knows what he's doing, but man, he's got to get more aggressive with these people.
[01:25:39.408 --> 01:25:40.949]  He's like, hey, prosperity's up.
[01:25:40.949 --> 01:25:44.790]  Hey, you know, every day announces new factories coming back.
[01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:45.890]  I understand that's great.
[01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:48.531]  They're trying to start a war before you even get in.
[01:25:48.531 --> 01:25:49.711]  You got to call these people out.
[01:25:52.861 --> 01:25:55.884]  And I know Trump knows the public's not that sophisticated, but it doesn't matter.
[01:25:55.884 --> 01:25:57.766]  He has to lead them to it.
[01:25:57.766 --> 01:26:01.189]  The message is complex.
[01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:05.733]  You make the public complex by putting out complex messages.
[01:26:05.733 --> 01:26:06.954]  That's my view.
[01:26:06.954 --> 01:26:08.616]  You can't dumb it down when it comes to this.
[01:26:12.338 --> 01:26:15.782]  Trump has to come out and say they're trying to start a war ahead of him getting into office.
[01:26:15.782 --> 01:26:17.744]  And it's the only way they're going to back off.
[01:26:17.744 --> 01:26:24.853]  You're going to be held responsible for trying to start an intifada, a revolution encouraging the Palestinians to riot, and all the stuff you're doing with Russia.
[01:26:24.853 --> 01:26:25.854]  You're full of crap.
[01:26:25.854 --> 01:26:27.095]  Stop saying I'm a Russian agent.
[01:26:27.936 --> 01:26:29.377]  You're the ones that brought in the Chinese.
[01:26:29.377 --> 01:26:32.200]  You're the ones that brought in the Saudi Arabians to fund the election.
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:34.442]  And I'm going to investigate that when I get in.
[01:26:34.442 --> 01:26:37.665]  You're scared I'm going to bring up you work for foreign powers, Hillary.
[01:26:37.665 --> 01:26:40.828]  We're going to investigate your ties to Russia when I get in.
[01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:44.231]  They got her red-handed on the uranium and all of it.
[01:26:44.231 --> 01:26:46.573]  He's got to take her on.
[01:26:46.573 --> 01:26:50.516]  He's got people telling him, look nice, look presidential, try to heal the country.
[01:26:50.516 --> 01:26:52.718]  That's if they weren't enemies.
[01:26:52.718 --> 01:26:54.500]  That's if they weren't trying to overthrow the country.
[01:26:55.575 --> 01:26:59.377]  That'd be the right thing if they weren't trying to unseat you, President-elect.
[01:26:59.377 --> 01:27:05.240]  You've got to go on the attack because we're under attack!
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.342]  He should talk about Soros being investigated for criminal activity when he gets in.
[01:27:08.342 --> 01:27:14.025]  He should say, Soros, I'm coming for you.
[01:27:14.025 --> 01:27:18.147]  I mean, Trump needs to come out to the press conference and say, how dare this Nazi collaborator compare me to Hitler.
[01:27:19.261 --> 01:27:23.482]  And then read his quotes about, the happiest time of my life was rounding up Jews in Hungary.
[01:27:23.482 --> 01:27:24.342]  What?
[01:27:24.342 --> 01:27:26.302]  He's crazy!
[01:27:26.302 --> 01:27:29.243]  Destroy him!
[01:27:29.243 --> 01:27:34.584]  Press the attack!
[01:27:34.584 --> 01:27:37.265]  Why do you think the Info Wars had such a big effect?
[01:27:37.265 --> 01:27:38.345]  The media is so arrogant.
[01:27:38.345 --> 01:27:40.985]  Oh, Alex is discrediting Trump.
[01:27:40.985 --> 01:27:43.526]  Oh, blew up in your face, didn't it, jackasses?
[01:27:44.517 --> 01:27:46.038]  We're not here to make friends.
[01:27:46.038 --> 01:27:47.318]  We're not here to get ratings.
[01:27:47.318 --> 01:27:49.999]  We're here to overthrow the New World Order.
[01:27:49.999 --> 01:27:52.741]  We're here to burn it down politically.
[01:27:52.741 --> 01:27:54.181]  We know you're attacking us.
[01:27:54.181 --> 01:27:55.482]  We're attacking you.
[01:27:55.482 --> 01:27:56.342]  You got lies.
[01:27:56.342 --> 01:27:57.263]  We got truth.
[01:27:57.263 --> 01:28:00.044]  We'll see what trumps what.
[01:28:00.044 --> 01:28:00.724]  Dan in Maryland.
[01:28:00.724 --> 01:28:01.565]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:28:01.565 --> 01:28:03.385]  Then Ward, Matt, Joel, John.
[01:28:03.385 --> 01:28:04.146]  Dan, thanks for holding.
[01:28:04.146 --> 01:28:04.486]  Go ahead.
[01:28:04.486 --> 01:28:06.567]  Yeah, no problem.
[01:28:06.567 --> 01:28:07.327]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:28:07.327 --> 01:28:07.807]  How you doing?
[01:28:07.807 --> 01:28:08.208]  Thank you, sir.
[01:28:08.208 --> 01:28:09.988]  Go ahead.
[01:28:09.988 --> 01:28:11.529]  I just wanted to raise the point.
[01:28:11.529 --> 01:28:13.110]  It seems pretty obvious that
[01:28:13.809 --> 01:28:17.454]  He had this go on in his childhood where he enjoyed spelling people out.
[01:28:17.454 --> 01:28:20.379]  That's why he has Obama spelling black people out.
[01:28:20.379 --> 01:28:22.662]  He's a liberal professor spelling white people out.
[01:28:22.662 --> 01:28:23.944]  Yes, he's into betrayal.
[01:28:23.944 --> 01:28:25.506]  He's very evil.
[01:28:25.506 --> 01:28:26.708]  True evil is about betrayal.
[01:28:28.055 --> 01:28:34.120]  Yeah, he tries to find other people that are into that, too, and I think it's just this whole... I don't know.
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:34.681]  Exactly!
[01:28:34.681 --> 01:28:43.308]  If you read the WikiLeaks, it is the most... It's like villains... If you wrote a comic book with villains talking like this, you'd say they sound too evil, nobody talks like this.
[01:28:43.308 --> 01:28:47.312]  But they all compete with each other about who can be the lowliest, filthy scumbag.
[01:28:47.312 --> 01:28:48.112]  You're exactly right.
[01:28:48.112 --> 01:28:49.554]  Go ahead.
[01:28:49.554 --> 01:28:50.614]  Oh, that's all I got.
[01:28:50.614 --> 01:28:51.555]  You can expand on that.
[01:28:51.555 --> 01:28:52.396]  No, no, go ahead.
[01:28:52.396 --> 01:28:54.398]  What do you think they're going to pull in the time we have?
[01:28:56.748 --> 01:28:59.729]  I don't know.
[01:28:59.729 --> 01:29:00.830]  That's all I really wanted to say.
[01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:01.510]  All right, great point.
[01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:02.871]  You're dead on, Dan.
[01:29:02.871 --> 01:29:04.011]  Dan just crystallized everything.
[01:29:04.011 --> 01:29:04.631]  I was going to give more time.
[01:29:04.631 --> 01:29:05.652]  I was going to get another minute until break.
[01:29:05.652 --> 01:29:07.733]  I'm going to come back and go to Ward, Matt, Joel, and John.
[01:29:07.733 --> 01:29:09.773]  I'm going to control myself.
[01:29:09.773 --> 01:29:11.794]  I just desperately want to keep warning people.
[01:29:11.794 --> 01:29:16.016]  The world has never been in more peril than it is now.
[01:29:16.016 --> 01:29:19.237]  And I told you years ago, moving towards this year, I could just see it.
[01:29:19.237 --> 01:29:19.897]  I could feel it.
[01:29:19.897 --> 01:29:22.378]  We're here now.
[01:29:22.378 --> 01:29:25.820]  I don't have the bad feeling anymore I had up to this election because now we're in the battle.
[01:29:26.835 --> 01:29:30.379]  Once the fight starts, you know, the butterflies are gone.
[01:29:30.379 --> 01:29:31.861]  Warhammer comes out.
[01:29:31.861 --> 01:29:35.224]  But this is going on right now, my friends.
[01:29:35.224 --> 01:29:37.987]  This is the future being decided now.
[01:29:37.987 --> 01:29:38.708]  Now.
[01:29:38.708 --> 01:29:41.211]  We are taking the world away from the globalists.
[01:29:41.211 --> 01:29:45.735]  We are wresting control of it, and they cannot stand it.
[01:29:45.735 --> 01:29:46.416]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:46.416 --> 01:29:47.798]  This is the InfoWar.
[01:29:47.798 --> 01:29:48.819]  We'll be back with your calls.
[01:29:50.444 --> 01:29:53.450]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.450 --> 01:29:57.057]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.939 --> 01:30:05.841]  Just how much are the Obama family's vacations costing the American taxpayer?
[01:30:05.841 --> 01:30:09.882]  Well, eight years of his vacations, a whopping $85 million.
[01:30:09.882 --> 01:30:18.526]  One report suggests this American family is enjoying vacations like Hawaiian vacations, for example, with a price tag of an annual trip of $3.5 million or more.
[01:30:18.526 --> 01:30:25.488]  In total, the cost of the first family's personal travel during the last years comes to a whopping $85 million.
[01:30:25.488 --> 01:30:30.150]  $90 million after additional records were released, according to one conservative group, Judicial Watch.
[01:30:30.450 --> 01:30:32.991]  And this is, of course, based on the federal government's records.
[01:30:32.991 --> 01:30:43.595]  The cost of Air Force One and other government planes, as well as helicopters, cargo planes, armored planes, Secret Service protection, advanced communications, medical staff, of course, is responsible for the bulk of this money.
[01:30:43.595 --> 01:30:49.557]  Directly quoting Judicial Watch here, the Secret Service and the Air Force are being abused by unnecessary travel.
[01:30:49.557 --> 01:30:53.979]  The average American family couldn't even afford to take a vacation this past year.
[01:30:53.979 --> 01:30:55.800]  We're working too hard, but don't worry.
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:57.840]  The First Family is going to do it for you.
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:59.461]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for InfoWars.
[01:31:00.741 --> 01:31:07.284]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:31:07.284 --> 01:31:10.506]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:31:10.506 --> 01:31:16.088]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:31:16.088 --> 01:31:22.211]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:31:22.211 --> 01:31:25.492]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:31:25.492 --> 01:31:26.953]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:31:27.153 --> 01:31:31.455]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:31:31.455 --> 01:31:34.396]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:31:34.396 --> 01:31:36.057]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:31:36.057 --> 01:31:39.519]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:31:39.519 --> 01:31:42.100]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:43.160]  It's in powder form.
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:46.042]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:31:46.042 --> 01:31:47.182]  I take this.
[01:31:47.182 --> 01:31:48.583]  This is the product that I take.
[01:31:48.583 --> 01:31:50.544]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:31:51.364 --> 01:31:52.165]  We fight the Globals.
[01:31:52.165 --> 01:31:53.306]  We fight the New World Order.
[01:31:53.306 --> 01:31:57.469]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLive.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:02.550]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:03.871]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:32:03.871 --> 01:32:05.091]  Why is this so good?
[01:32:05.091 --> 01:32:10.374]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:32:10.374 --> 01:32:23.921]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:32:23.921 --> 01:32:25.282]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:32:26.062 --> 01:32:27.703]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:32:27.703 --> 01:32:30.264]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:32:30.264 --> 01:32:31.565]  These are all parasites.
[01:32:31.565 --> 01:32:32.665]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:32:32.665 --> 01:32:34.006]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:32:34.006 --> 01:32:38.528]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:32:38.528 --> 01:32:41.689]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:32:41.789 --> 01:32:44.850]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:32:44.850 --> 01:32:45.890]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:32:45.890 --> 01:32:47.831]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:47.831 --> 01:32:48.851]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:32:48.851 --> 01:32:51.552]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:32:51.552 --> 01:32:54.813]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:54.813 --> 01:32:57.074]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:32:57.074 --> 01:32:59.015]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:33:18.746 --> 01:33:22.827]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:22.827 --> 01:33:24.648]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.648 --> 01:33:30.770]  I saw a couple articles yesterday about China has a big initiative
[01:33:49.130 --> 01:33:49.931]  I don't have it in front of me.
[01:33:49.931 --> 01:33:50.871]  It sounds so unbelievable.
[01:33:50.871 --> 01:33:52.473]  Perhaps you guys can pull it up.
[01:33:52.473 --> 01:33:57.276]  China has a new nationwide initiative for tourism to upgrade their toilets.
[01:33:57.276 --> 01:34:05.042]  Because you know, over 70% of the toilets, it's estimated, the AP wrote, in China are holes in the ground.
[01:34:05.042 --> 01:34:11.647]  And you go in and squat over a hole in a just room with other people.
[01:34:11.647 --> 01:34:12.768]  And that's how you use the bathroom.
[01:34:14.252 --> 01:34:20.556]  I wanted to juxtapose that with China says that they got this new aircraft carrier that's going to blow us up, and they're also going to land on the dark side of the moon.
[01:34:20.556 --> 01:34:32.564]  So they're going to innovate the whole world, but they can't, in 60 plus years of communist rule, almost 70 years, I guess or more since 1949, they can't even deliver toilets to the public.
[01:34:32.564 --> 01:34:33.564]  There it is, Reuters.
[01:34:33.564 --> 01:34:38.107]  China plans toilet revolution to boost tourism!
[01:34:38.107 --> 01:34:40.769]  That's right, because you're supposed to just crap on the side of the road.
[01:34:42.875 --> 01:34:43.695]  You been to India?
[01:34:43.695 --> 01:34:44.816]  You been to China?
[01:34:44.816 --> 01:34:53.278]  I haven't, but Paul Watson has and my family has and I mean it is unbelievable.
[01:34:53.278 --> 01:34:55.218]  I had one crew member go to India last year.
[01:34:55.218 --> 01:35:00.060]  I'm not going to tell the story because they're not here today and I haven't asked their permission.
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:09.262]  They went there on tourism and fell on a street walking past their head into a giant slurry of human feces on a major street.
[01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:15.611]  Now why am I going there?
[01:35:15.611 --> 01:35:21.154]  Bash America all day, all these little snot-nosed communists and everybody else with their smartphones.
[01:35:21.154 --> 01:35:30.138]  There it is, India's government is now shaming people into using toilets.
[01:35:30.138 --> 01:35:35.120]  But we're told we just need to adopt this here.
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:37.882]  We don't need to innovate at all.
[01:35:37.882 --> 01:35:41.504]  So, again, Americans hold the lowest number of passports
[01:35:42.489 --> 01:35:44.770]  Per capita than any other industrialized country.
[01:35:44.770 --> 01:35:50.933]  And so you got all these bubbled kids who just literally hear their professor telling them, America is horrible and evil.
[01:35:50.933 --> 01:35:52.814]  The rest of the world is glistening and perfect.
[01:35:52.814 --> 01:35:56.096]  The health care in England is totally free and the best thing you ever had.
[01:35:56.096 --> 01:35:57.216]  Cuba is incredible.
[01:35:57.216 --> 01:35:58.457]  They have rocket ships.
[01:35:58.457 --> 01:36:00.298]  They've colonized Mars there.
[01:36:00.298 --> 01:36:05.480]  I mean, they don't go that far, but it's basically Castro floats around and Jesus says he loves him.
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:07.922]  I mean, it is just ridiculous.
[01:36:07.922 --> 01:36:10.063]  Castro flies a flying carpet.
[01:36:10.743 --> 01:36:14.966]  Castro has jewels that drip from his fingertips.
[01:36:14.966 --> 01:36:17.887]  Oh yeah, Alex, everything's free in Cuba!
[01:36:17.887 --> 01:36:24.391]  Yeah, you're free to work 18 hours a day, eat squid three times a day, like Tony Montana says.
[01:36:24.391 --> 01:36:25.792]  You like a Chavano in every corny?
[01:36:25.792 --> 01:36:29.114]  Baa, baa, baa, sheep.
[01:36:29.114 --> 01:36:32.956]  Want me to tell you what to eat, what to wear, where to go, what to do?
[01:36:32.956 --> 01:36:34.858]  You a communist?
[01:36:34.858 --> 01:36:36.679]  I kill a communist for free.
[01:36:36.679 --> 01:36:37.019]  For fun.
[01:36:38.467 --> 01:36:48.110]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls now on Soros, the famous Nazi collaborator, warning the world that Trump is a Hitler dictator.
[01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:50.691]  You cannot make it up.
[01:36:50.691 --> 01:36:59.274]  Obama is set in the next few hours to come out and announce that they're basically declaring war on Russia with cyber attacks, economic warfare, you name it.
[01:36:59.274 --> 01:37:02.875]  Already Russian jets are getting blown up, you name it.
[01:37:02.875 --> 01:37:04.836]  And a funeral for two, isn't this weird?
[01:37:06.803 --> 01:37:19.267]  Carrie Fisher, God rest her soul, dies after having a heart attack flying from London to LAX.
[01:37:19.267 --> 01:37:28.711]  And then her mother, another famous actress, Debbie Reynolds, dies of a suspected stroke.
[01:37:28.711 --> 01:37:33.192]  Was it a stroke?
[01:37:33.192 --> 01:37:34.513]  Or was it star killing?
[01:37:35.782 --> 01:37:43.946]  And by the way, I pretty much trolled the media a few days ago when I asked, is this star killing?
[01:37:43.946 --> 01:37:50.568]  Because when somebody's outlived their usefulness, basically, mafias do run Hollywood, and I've talked to a lot of high-level Hollywood folks.
[01:37:50.568 --> 01:37:57.552]  There is the belief that when you're no longer useful, they're about to put up your original catalog and rock and roll, or movies, or you name it.
[01:37:57.552 --> 01:38:05.035]  Folks tend to get killed to make them valuable again, right when some new production's being rolled out.
[01:38:05.984 --> 01:38:11.388]  Plus they can also show you the original Carrie Fisher from the 1977 New Hope.
[01:38:11.388 --> 01:38:15.111]  She's back in the new movie via computer and you can't tell the difference.
[01:38:15.111 --> 01:38:26.640]  So you really don't need Carrie Fisher anymore because you've got a digital version of her and then magically she dies right on time and then her mommy, who controlled her estate, dies a few days later.
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:27.861]  Coincidence?
[01:38:27.861 --> 01:38:31.904]  What if other members of the family that have claims on her start all dying?
[01:38:33.479 --> 01:38:34.961]  Would you then ask a question?
[01:38:34.961 --> 01:38:37.724]  Now, I said I don't think they killed Carrie Fisher.
[01:38:37.724 --> 01:38:41.408]  But see, we need to think about star killing and understand this goes on.
[01:38:41.408 --> 01:38:44.311]  The ultimate mafia is Hollywood.
[01:38:44.311 --> 01:38:44.972]  They actually found it.
[01:38:44.972 --> 01:38:47.034]  There's Carrie Fisher.
[01:38:47.034 --> 01:38:48.476]  Not from the original 1977, but the 2016 release, Rogue One.
[01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:57.661]  Which, by the way, is a very avant-garde movie.
[01:38:57.661 --> 01:39:08.352]  It's the best produced Star Wars movie ever, and I gotta say, Disney, despite the fact I don't like Disney in many respects, did a really great job with the film, and the final scene is as good as it gets.
[01:39:08.352 --> 01:39:13.597]  And then it's just Governor Tark's back, and everybody's back because of CG, and it's incredible.
[01:39:15.253 --> 01:39:17.715]  Some of the battle scenes are a little exhausting, but they're still well done.
[01:39:17.715 --> 01:39:22.057]  I mean, it's got some Communist Chinese Politburo worship in it, what doesn't?
[01:39:22.057 --> 01:39:26.120]  But, you know, I'll give it four and a half stars out of five stars.
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:29.582]  Because I guess the bar was so low, the last one was so bad.
[01:39:29.582 --> 01:39:30.883]  Episode one was so horrible.
[01:39:30.883 --> 01:39:32.944]  I mean, it's just terrible stuff.
[01:39:32.944 --> 01:39:37.027]  So, still impressive.
[01:39:37.027 --> 01:39:42.350]  Now, the media will take that out of context and say that I said Carrie Fisher was murdered and so was her mother.
[01:39:42.350 --> 01:39:42.891]  I didn't say that.
[01:39:44.258 --> 01:39:47.639]  They already got news articles saying I said that, from when I said it two days ago.
[01:39:47.639 --> 01:39:49.120]  That's fine.
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:57.343]  People then see that, they come here with this madman saying, and they find out what I'm really saying is not what they said.
[01:39:57.343 --> 01:40:06.746]  But you see these stars running out of Hollywood, running to Europe, running to Canada, and it's because managers do take people's money, people do die.
[01:40:06.746 --> 01:40:08.647]  Look, all the stuff came out with Pelicano.
[01:40:08.647 --> 01:40:12.388]  It was always said that he was running around doing stuff behind the scenes, and it started coming out, and Cory was.
[01:40:13.933 --> 01:40:15.434]  But that's nothing.
[01:40:15.434 --> 01:40:31.005]  I've been at, for whatever reason, because they wanted to put out some films, they wanted to put out Lose Change in theaters, and Mark Cuban wanted to, I have been in the rooms with the biggest lawyers in Hollywood, and the biggest producers, and it is like something out of The Godfather.
[01:40:31.005 --> 01:40:33.147]  It's old men smoking cigarettes, bitching,
[01:40:34.895 --> 01:40:42.261]  Who are worth, in some cases, billions of dollars going, uh, tell you what, I'll kill that son of a bitch, you're giving me a problem.
[01:40:42.261 --> 01:40:44.744]  You're like, hey, have a safe trip back home.
[01:40:44.744 --> 01:40:47.706]  Are you threatening me?
[01:40:47.706 --> 01:40:50.208]  You're going to kill me?
[01:40:50.208 --> 01:40:54.572]  Because they couldn't believe I was in these meetings arguing with them and acting like I was an equal.
[01:40:54.572 --> 01:40:57.775]  I'm like, we in Texas, we say, have a safe trip home.
[01:40:57.775 --> 01:40:59.436]  Uh-huh.
[01:40:59.436 --> 01:41:00.297]  Yeah.
[01:41:00.297 --> 01:41:02.199]  I get them like some million dollar Maybach.
[01:41:02.878 --> 01:41:04.379]  Just crazy!
[01:41:04.379 --> 01:41:07.061]  And that's because it's gangster-run, folks.
[01:41:07.061 --> 01:41:10.164]  You better believe it.
[01:41:10.164 --> 01:41:11.565]  And you always hear Hollywood's Jewish.
[01:41:11.565 --> 01:41:11.885]  It is.
[01:41:11.885 --> 01:41:14.988]  I'd say half-Jewish.
[01:41:14.988 --> 01:41:18.210]  Another 20-30% Italian.
[01:41:18.210 --> 01:41:21.433]  And then coming in with the money are the Arabs and the Chinese.
[01:41:21.433 --> 01:41:24.235]  I mean, I was there witnessing at the time.
[01:41:24.235 --> 01:41:25.356]  And now it's all over the news.
[01:41:25.356 --> 01:41:29.700]  But I said I'd go to your phone calls on the Soros situation.
[01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:29.880]  But
[01:41:32.358 --> 01:41:35.881]  I mean, with the Italians, it's like, wow, these are real gangsters.
[01:41:35.881 --> 01:41:38.644]  These are the gangster families that went legitimate 50 years ago.
[01:41:38.644 --> 01:41:40.165]  It's amazing.
[01:41:40.165 --> 01:41:44.148]  People have no idea the crazy levels of these people.
[01:41:44.148 --> 01:41:49.593]  Some of these folks are making $100 million a week on their TV shows.
[01:41:49.593 --> 01:41:52.856]  There are producers that own 5, 6, 7 shows that are on.
[01:41:52.856 --> 01:41:58.061]  They're getting $5, $10, $15 million per show themselves per week.
[01:41:58.061 --> 01:41:59.222]  Hundreds of millions a week.
[01:42:01.138 --> 01:42:01.918]  Man, it's crazy.
[01:42:01.918 --> 01:42:03.539]  They don't trust their families.
[01:42:03.539 --> 01:42:05.859]  Look at Sumner Redstone.
[01:42:05.859 --> 01:42:09.320]  I've been in meetings when Redstone is on the speakerphone yelling at people.
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:12.701]  And they hang on, he's very mercurial.
[01:42:12.701 --> 01:42:13.962]  I mean, it is crazy.
[01:42:13.962 --> 01:42:21.304]  For whatever reason, God let me into these meetings and I've seen the craziest stuff you can imagine.
[01:42:21.304 --> 01:42:24.545]  Old toad-like men smoking cigarettes.
[01:42:24.545 --> 01:42:29.126]  I mean, it's something else.
[01:42:29.126 --> 01:42:29.426]  Okay.
[01:42:32.247 --> 01:42:36.968]  Let me just tell you, the people that run Hollywood took it from other people or fought to keep what they got.
[01:42:36.968 --> 01:42:38.908]  It's gangster land.
[01:42:38.908 --> 01:42:46.470]  But you never hear that because, see, oh, the gangsters only existed in the 1940s and 50s in New York and New Jersey, and they were all Italian.
[01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:50.450]  Oh, yeah, right.
[01:42:50.450 --> 01:42:54.791]  And they also all seem to think Texas is like its own gangsterville, which it kind of is.
[01:42:54.791 --> 01:42:57.612]  But see, the real gangsters, nobody knows they're gangsters.
[01:42:57.612 --> 01:42:58.232]  See how that works?
[01:42:59.366 --> 01:43:02.128]  See, the general public doesn't know how the world works.
[01:43:02.128 --> 01:43:07.792]  They believe Hollywood that gives them a fantasy land.
[01:43:07.792 --> 01:43:10.994]  Alright, let's go to your calls on Soros and all the rest of it.
[01:43:10.994 --> 01:43:12.835]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Who's up next?
[01:43:12.835 --> 01:43:13.435]  Is it Ward?
[01:43:13.435 --> 01:43:13.875]  Is it Matt?
[01:43:13.875 --> 01:43:14.276]  Is it Kevin?
[01:43:14.276 --> 01:43:14.736]  Is it John?
[01:43:14.736 --> 01:43:17.238]  Is it Ferris?
[01:43:17.238 --> 01:43:18.899]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ward in Kansas.
[01:43:18.899 --> 01:43:23.061]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:43:23.061 --> 01:43:23.822]  Very interesting.
[01:43:23.822 --> 01:43:24.822]  Ward, go ahead.
[01:43:24.822 --> 01:43:25.143]  Thank you.
[01:43:25.143 --> 01:43:25.343]  Go ahead.
[01:43:27.067 --> 01:43:28.467]  Uh, I'm torn.
[01:43:28.467 --> 01:43:31.648]  I don't know where Thor should be deported to.
[01:43:31.648 --> 01:43:36.349]  Would Russia, Israel, or Gitmo be better for him?
[01:43:36.349 --> 01:43:38.650]  A lot of Hollywood folks said they want to go to Mars.
[01:43:38.650 --> 01:43:45.132]  I think we put him in a spaceship, space capsule, send the vampire to Mars, there's no blood for him to drink, metaphorically.
[01:43:45.132 --> 01:43:49.573]  Or how about we give him a, uh, deport him to hell?
[01:43:49.573 --> 01:43:50.613]  That would be generous.
[01:43:52.509 --> 01:43:54.390]  What do you think of Soros running around panicking?
[01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:55.391]  I think it's wonderful.
[01:43:55.391 --> 01:43:58.193]  But I'm concerned about what he may pull.
[01:43:58.193 --> 01:44:03.456]  I can't understand how this man can be left out in public.
[01:44:03.456 --> 01:44:12.963]  Why he's not behind bars and his assets either seized or frozen so he can't buy his way out.
[01:44:14.175 --> 01:44:15.755]  Well, we have to keep identifying him.
[01:44:15.755 --> 01:44:18.256]  Look, the crimes that have been committed by the globalists are so big.
[01:44:18.256 --> 01:44:20.136]  They've got so many people in on the crime with them.
[01:44:20.136 --> 01:44:23.397]  They believe the criminality is so huge that it's too big to fail.
[01:44:23.397 --> 01:44:24.697]  That's how they work these corruptions.
[01:44:24.697 --> 01:44:28.038]  But now, the corruption got so big it was bringing down our whole society.
[01:44:28.038 --> 01:44:29.498]  Now they must be dealt with.
[01:44:29.498 --> 01:44:30.358]  They went too far.
[01:44:30.358 --> 01:44:31.159]  God bless you, Ward.
[01:44:31.159 --> 01:44:32.219]  That's a good question.
[01:44:32.219 --> 01:44:35.039]  Where do we deport Soros to?
[01:44:35.039 --> 01:44:36.440]  He's originally from Eastern Europe.
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:40.020]  I think we deport him to Russia.
[01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:42.041]  They've got an arrest warrant for him in Russia right now.
[01:44:43.470 --> 01:44:45.451]  All right, Matt in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:44:45.451 --> 01:44:48.313]  Welcome, thanks for calling.
[01:44:48.313 --> 01:44:50.474]  Hey Alex, I just want to thank you first.
[01:44:50.474 --> 01:45:00.960]  You inspired me to start a site a while ago and I made it easy to read to try to reach people that sometimes have trouble reading real complex things and big articles and stuff like that.
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:07.284]  Sorry, I was digressing a little bit, but my point is... Well, tell us what your blog is.
[01:45:07.284 --> 01:45:08.785]  It's thedailyinformer.net.
[01:45:10.131 --> 01:45:13.732]  That's a great name, great job, and look, it's all about you.
[01:45:13.732 --> 01:45:15.053]  You're not digressing.
[01:45:15.053 --> 01:45:19.254]  Putting up blogs, doing videos, all of us responding, all of us speaking out.
[01:45:19.254 --> 01:45:21.695]  We're unstoppable, despite all their attempts at censorship.
[01:45:21.695 --> 01:45:30.478]  Now is the time for everybody, whether it's low-tech newsletters, or handing out business cards that have websites on them, or whether it's showing a film at your local theater or your church.
[01:45:30.478 --> 01:45:31.558]  Every little bit counts.
[01:45:31.558 --> 01:45:32.699]  Together it moves mountains.
[01:45:32.699 --> 01:45:34.339]  Go ahead.
[01:45:34.339 --> 01:45:38.881]  Well, it's mind-blowing how the majority of people aren't making
[01:45:39.404 --> 01:45:40.065]  I don't know.
[01:45:59.690 --> 01:46:02.753]  By the way, that's why 80% of military age men, they admit that's the plan.
[01:46:19.338 --> 01:46:20.758]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:46:47.731 --> 01:46:55.596]  Hey, remember a few years ago you reported of nuclear devices missing out of a base in South Carolina?
[01:46:55.596 --> 01:46:57.818]  No, it was West Texas.
[01:46:57.818 --> 01:46:59.119]  West Texas.
[01:46:59.119 --> 01:47:01.840]  Are they still missing?
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:08.525]  We were called by people on the base and told nuclear weapons are being transferred out of here.
[01:47:08.525 --> 01:47:10.306]  They weren't even supposed to be here.
[01:47:10.306 --> 01:47:12.628]  They're being sent to the East Coast.
[01:47:13.723 --> 01:47:28.421]  And then, after we reported that, Lindsey Graham came out and said, there are nukes that have been brought in by Islamists and are going to blow up our base, exactly where we said the nukes had been sent on the East Coast and all hell broke loose.
[01:47:28.421 --> 01:47:29.282]  And remember also,
[01:47:30.561 --> 01:47:41.889]  Six cruise missiles came up missing from Minot base up north and showed up down in Louisiana and then six people at the base got almost seriously died in the next two days.
[01:47:41.889 --> 01:47:45.432]  So there's been cases of missing nukes before.
[01:47:45.432 --> 01:47:48.915]  False flag in the next 20 days.
[01:47:48.915 --> 01:47:51.697]  You think that's why they'd want missing nukes?
[01:47:51.697 --> 01:47:58.562]  No, I think they're going to use the missing nukes to possibly nuke New York and cause the false flag before Trump gets put into office.
[01:48:00.029 --> 01:48:18.494]  Yeah, you know, in fact, CNN last night during Situation Room, they were saying, there's going to be a war, there's going to be huge terror attacks, it's now Trump's fault that he got elected, and it's Israel's fault, and then they all just said, it is his fault, and they all just said, it is basically willed, like a cult, and they all just kind of looked down, and solemnly.
[01:48:18.494 --> 01:48:20.994]  So, they're planning something big, that's all I know.
[01:48:20.994 --> 01:48:26.196]  They've committed, they've decided they're better than everybody, and that they're unstoppable, and who knows what they're going to do.
[01:48:26.196 --> 01:48:27.556]  I think that's what they're going to pull.
[01:48:29.582 --> 01:48:30.323]  They look scared.
[01:48:30.323 --> 01:48:31.483]  They look committed yesterday.
[01:48:31.483 --> 01:48:34.125]  Again, I've been monitoring them.
[01:48:34.125 --> 01:48:46.895]  Their body language has changed into kind of panicking that they weren't going to get to have their way with this very slowly as perverts, political perverts, culturally slowly sucking out our essence.
[01:48:46.895 --> 01:48:49.857]  So now they want to have, I guess, some big new crisis.
[01:48:49.857 --> 01:48:50.298]  What do you think?
[01:48:51.508 --> 01:48:53.470]  Well, I think you're absolutely right.
[01:48:53.470 --> 01:49:00.395]  My uncle works for the Department of Defense and he keeps telling me to be quiet and to shut up that I'm getting too close.
[01:49:00.395 --> 01:49:04.538]  I don't know if he's just doing it to screw with me or if he's actually serious.
[01:49:04.538 --> 01:49:08.881]  But I think that's your false flag in the next 20 days.
[01:49:08.881 --> 01:49:13.445]  Well, most people in the Department of Defense are compartmentalized as well.
[01:49:13.445 --> 01:49:18.449]  So if you've got an uncle making fun of you, it's because he doesn't like the fact you're younger trying to inform him.
[01:49:18.449 --> 01:49:20.831]  But there have been missing nukes before.
[01:49:22.276 --> 01:49:29.359]  Our sources were real, and all hell broke loose the next few days about nukes, and suddenly they said nukes were about to go off on the East Coast.
[01:49:29.359 --> 01:49:32.080]  I believe we may have stopped the false flag.
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:33.320]  So I don't know.
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:44.524]  I mean, you know, the point is, is that people know we will put out information from good sources to warn the public so we get information nobody else gets, because other people are too scared to do it.
[01:49:44.524 --> 01:49:45.945]  I appreciate your call, Kevin.
[01:49:45.945 --> 01:49:49.966]  John in Colorado, thanks for holding your own here.
[01:49:49.966 --> 01:49:51.127]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[01:49:51.127 --> 01:49:51.507]  Good, go ahead.
[01:49:53.297 --> 01:49:58.202]  Hey, a couple days ago, Google removed the Holocaust denial site.
[01:49:58.202 --> 01:50:00.344]  Did you hear about that from their top searches?
[01:50:00.344 --> 01:50:04.507]  I did not, but I know that they've been delisting us on their Chrome, then it came back.
[01:50:04.507 --> 01:50:11.173]  I know that this is this fake news purge, and again, if people agree with the Holocaust the way it was said or not, it should be free speech.
[01:50:11.173 --> 01:50:13.676]  Things like that shouldn't be removed.
[01:50:13.676 --> 01:50:16.879]  I mean, if something is the top search that's getting the most traffic,
[01:50:18.853 --> 01:50:20.935]  It all goes back to what Drudge said last October when he came down to Austin.
[01:50:20.935 --> 01:50:22.396]  He said that it was coming this year.
[01:50:39.813 --> 01:50:41.935]  And he was very right in different facets.
[01:51:01.582 --> 01:51:04.203]  How confident are you in your food storage?
[01:51:04.203 --> 01:51:08.225]  If it was all you had to rely on, would it sustain your family?
[01:51:08.225 --> 01:51:14.328]  Hard times, good times, or any time, NuMana storable food is the proven superior choice.
[01:51:14.328 --> 01:51:19.150]  Learn for yourself what happened when one man ate only NuMana storable food for an entire month.

[01:53:08.516 --> 01:53:10.919]  Tired of cold hands or cold feet?

[01:54:06.289 --> 01:54:08.390]  Central, we're here live.
[01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:09.890]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:54:09.890 --> 01:54:12.791]  Under attack by George Soros.
[01:54:12.791 --> 01:54:14.651]  The MSM.
[01:54:14.651 --> 01:54:18.872]  Laws are being passed to shut down domestic media they call false news.
[01:54:18.872 --> 01:54:24.994]  Now they're not worried about the real fake news sites that are out there claiming Bigfoot, you know, was found or whatever.
[01:54:24.994 --> 01:54:26.994]  Or claiming that Alec Baldwin died.
[01:54:26.994 --> 01:54:30.515]  In fact, the New York Times takes the advertising of the sites that do that.
[01:54:30.515 --> 01:54:31.315]  And gets caught doing it.
[01:54:32.071 --> 01:54:43.060]  No, they're worried about us because we're cutting edge, you know what we're talking about, and the foreign intelligence agency heads listen to the show, the military listens, the police listen.
[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:47.823]  I'm obnoxious, I come off like a wild man, but people know this is, you gotta be crazy to be willing to do what I've done.
[01:54:47.823 --> 01:54:51.406]  But I'm not crazy, I understood history.
[01:54:51.406 --> 01:54:56.030]  And I've got an instinct to stand up against scum that wants to hurt innocent people.
[01:54:56.030 --> 01:55:00.934]  And I'm looking for men out there and women that have the same instinct and who want to take action.
[01:55:01.994 --> 01:55:04.295]  In the information war.
[01:55:04.295 --> 01:55:08.078]  So they've tried to frame us as violent all these years when they're the ones that are violent.
[01:55:08.078 --> 01:55:09.659]  And now that's failed.
[01:55:09.659 --> 01:55:26.569]  And their arrogance in trying to get cops killed and intimidate cops around the country to go under UN control with the Strong Cities Initiative was one of the final nails in the coffins of this system and made the police go research everything we said and basically fully convert to reality.
[01:55:26.569 --> 01:55:30.852]  And then some, because they're in to a lot of knowledge databases we don't have access to.
[01:55:32.079 --> 01:55:51.923]  And so between the police, the military, people in intelligence agencies, corporate chiefs, all the real thinking people have been doing their homework the last few years, and we know more about the globalist operation than most high-level globalists, who just are sellouts, do what they're told, carry out their little compartmentalized area, and then go play golf.
[01:55:51.923 --> 01:55:52.803]  Not us.
[01:55:52.803 --> 01:55:55.643]  We're not playing golf.
[01:55:55.643 --> 01:55:59.604]  Trump hadn't played golf in a year and a half until this Christmas vacation, and it's well deserved.
[01:56:01.237 --> 01:56:03.859]  We're not screwing around.
[01:56:03.859 --> 01:56:06.740]  This is like a video game for the real world.
[01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:08.561]  People stay up for days playing a video game.
[01:56:08.561 --> 01:56:11.123]  I stay up for days doing this because we're affecting change.
[01:56:11.123 --> 01:56:12.263]  We're having victory.
[01:56:12.263 --> 01:56:14.405]  I'm hired in a kite with no drugs.
[01:56:14.405 --> 01:56:15.125]  This is exciting.
[01:56:15.125 --> 01:56:18.127]  I'm going to go back to your calls here in a moment.
[01:56:18.127 --> 01:56:19.508]  John in Colorado let him finish up.
[01:56:19.508 --> 01:56:23.410]  He was making some good points about how they're... I was googling it during the break.
[01:56:23.410 --> 01:56:25.991]  Can you guys get me some stuff about Google blocking sites?
[01:56:25.991 --> 01:56:27.692]  I knew they were already doing that and talking about it.
[01:56:27.692 --> 01:56:29.233]  I knew Germany was already doing it.
[01:56:29.233 --> 01:56:30.534]  But wow, to actually see them do it.
[01:56:32.566 --> 01:56:38.451]  Again, even if you disagree with sites like that, they're going to take your right next, folks.
[01:56:38.451 --> 01:56:44.376]  First Germany banned Nazis, now they're banning nationalist groups and people criticizing Islam.
[01:56:44.376 --> 01:56:48.719]  You've got to support free speech or it all goes.
[01:56:48.719 --> 01:56:52.562]  That's why there's towns now that are announcing they're not going to let Nazis have parades.
[01:56:52.562 --> 01:56:54.724]  You've got to let them have it.
[01:56:54.724 --> 01:56:58.107]  Or you've got to let the new Black Panther Party have it as well.
[01:56:58.107 --> 01:56:59.928]  That's just a black hate group.
[01:56:59.928 --> 01:57:00.669]  You've got to let them do it.
[01:57:01.846 --> 01:57:02.786]  Or everybody loses it.
[01:57:02.786 --> 01:57:04.047]  It's real simple.
[01:57:04.047 --> 01:57:04.547]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:57:04.547 --> 01:57:06.308]  I guess it's on Fortune Magazine.
[01:57:06.308 --> 01:57:10.830]  Google demotes Holocaust denial and hate sites in update to algorithm.
[01:57:10.830 --> 01:57:11.451]  Wow!
[01:57:11.451 --> 01:57:12.511]  I missed that.
[01:57:12.511 --> 01:57:13.732]  That was nine days ago.
[01:57:13.732 --> 01:57:17.073]  You know, all the time people go, why aren't you covering this?
[01:57:17.073 --> 01:57:18.594]  I mean, he nicely did it.
[01:57:18.594 --> 01:57:19.915]  And I'm like, because there's just so much.
[01:57:19.915 --> 01:57:21.175]  Thank you for letting me know.
[01:57:21.175 --> 01:57:23.136]  I knew all sorts of censorship was kicking in.
[01:57:23.136 --> 01:57:24.617]  It's happening to us.
[01:57:24.617 --> 01:57:25.838]  So I'll do a big report on this.
[01:57:25.838 --> 01:57:26.098]  In fact,
[01:57:26.971 --> 01:57:28.973]  You should probably have on whoever this person is.
[01:57:28.973 --> 01:57:29.634]  I disagree with him.
[01:57:29.634 --> 01:57:31.235]  I mean, Hitler did target Jews.
[01:57:31.235 --> 01:57:32.196]  He did kill them.
[01:57:32.196 --> 01:57:34.699]  You can argue about how many were killed or whatever.
[01:57:34.699 --> 01:57:37.121]  Something like 100 million people got killed in World War II.
[01:57:37.121 --> 01:57:39.443]  I mean, all I know is it was real bad.
[01:57:39.443 --> 01:57:41.766]  I mean, Hitler did have the final solution, saying kill the Jews.
[01:57:41.766 --> 01:57:43.628]  I mean, that went on.
[01:57:43.628 --> 01:57:47.051]  The point is, should you then ban people that say...
[01:57:49.744 --> 01:57:52.486]  The Russians said six million died at one facility.
[01:57:52.486 --> 01:57:53.946]  That was clearly not true.
[01:57:53.946 --> 01:57:56.388]  Then it turned into six million total, whatever.
[01:57:56.388 --> 01:57:59.409]  The point is, is that Hitler killed a bunch of people.
[01:57:59.409 --> 01:58:03.312]  Now, um, briefly, we have free shipping going until the new year.
[01:58:03.312 --> 01:58:05.753]  We're extending Christmas as it makes the globalists angry.
[01:58:05.753 --> 01:58:09.935]  We have 50 to 25% off, the lowest discount is 25% off, on hundreds of items.
[01:58:09.935 --> 01:58:11.736]  All the major nutraceuticals.
[01:58:11.736 --> 01:58:15.198]  Super Mel Vitality is 30% off the already discounted price.
[01:58:15.198 --> 01:58:16.079]  That's going to sell out.
[01:58:17.367 --> 01:58:19.528]  I'd say by early next week, because it's such a hot seller.
[01:58:19.528 --> 01:58:21.409]  We won't get more for three to four weeks.
[01:58:21.409 --> 01:58:24.831]  Super Female Vitality, which is just as good for women, is not about to sell out.
[01:58:24.831 --> 01:58:26.391]  For some reason, women don't get it.
[01:58:26.391 --> 01:58:27.032]  You really should.
[01:58:27.032 --> 01:58:27.772]  It's amazing.
[01:58:27.772 --> 01:58:30.153]  The libido, the energy, the stamina, all of it.
[01:58:30.153 --> 01:58:31.894]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:31.894 --> 01:58:34.155]  Infowarsstore.com is the big umbrella site.

[01:58:40.638 --> 01:58:41.539]  Third Hour coming up.

[01:58:43.339 --> 01:58:44.280]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.888 --> 01:58:48.092]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:58:51.022 --> 01:59:00.285]  As we get ready to kick off 2017, it's more important than ever to realize it's the First Amendment that allowed us to defeat the globalist witch Hillary Clinton.
[01:59:00.285 --> 01:59:03.986]  And these enemies of free speech are out there telling us, don't say Merry Christmas.
[01:59:03.986 --> 01:59:05.286]  In fact, don't even say holidays.
[01:59:05.286 --> 01:59:06.666]  Well, I got news for them.
[01:59:06.666 --> 01:59:14.448]  Just because of them doing that, I'm going to extend our Christmas sales right through into 2017.
[01:59:14.448 --> 01:59:16.649]  We're talking store-wide free shipping and
[01:59:17.249 --> 01:59:20.732]  50 to 25% off on the Nutraceuticals and so much more.
[01:59:20.732 --> 01:59:32.740]  So whether it's a Hillary for Prison 2017 shirt, or whether it's Survival Shield X2, or Supermail Vitality, we've got the biggest sales of 2016 right into 2017 while supplies last.
[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:38.464]  We are selling out of many of these items because this sale is so big and we've extended it, so please take advantage of this.
[01:59:38.464 --> 01:59:45.969]  And again, thank you for fighting for the Infowar and supporting our operation and supporting not just the First Amendment, but free speech worldwide.
[01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:53.412]  That's InfoWarsShore.com, or go right to the supplements at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:59:53.412 --> 01:59:56.013]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:09.875 --> 02:00:14.723]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:14.723 --> 02:00:19.710]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:41.860 --> 02:00:58.366]  Alright, let's take some phone calls out of Roger Stone's on Instagram at Roundtable Discussion right into the next hour, where every fourth hour we have a guest host, whether it's our great anchors or reporters, or people like John Rappaport, who is just one of the most concise, focused, truly compassionate liberal brains out there.
[02:00:58.366 --> 02:01:01.927]  When I mean liberal, I mean real liberal.
[02:01:01.927 --> 02:01:04.168]  Like, pro-gum, but also pro-gardening.
[02:01:05.208 --> 02:01:07.849]  And just really piercing intellect.
[02:01:07.849 --> 02:01:08.669]  I mean, I just love the guy.
[02:01:08.669 --> 02:01:09.750]  He's coming up in the fourth hour.
[02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:11.090]  NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[02:01:11.090 --> 02:01:12.891]  He's had that site for more than a decade.
[02:01:12.891 --> 02:01:14.231]  Of course, he exposes the mainstream media.
[02:01:14.231 --> 02:01:15.271]  They're the fake news.
[02:01:15.271 --> 02:01:18.492]  The New York Times is bombarding that we have taken their term from them.
[02:01:18.492 --> 02:01:20.993]  We've called you fake news over and over again.
[02:01:20.993 --> 02:01:23.814]  Now, I'm mad I didn't officially ever settle on that name.
[02:01:23.814 --> 02:01:27.596]  It was always debated ad nauseum what your true title is.
[02:01:27.596 --> 02:01:31.237]  Collaborators, scum media, filth media, the anti-media.
[02:01:32.037 --> 02:01:43.229]  The anti-Trump, the anti-America, the prostitutes, the Decepticons, the sewer, the arrogant, narcissistic, con-game media.
[02:01:43.229 --> 02:01:46.372]  I mean, you're just the fake media.
[02:01:46.372 --> 02:01:46.893]  You're the enemy.
[02:01:48.616 --> 02:01:49.657]  Let's go to John Colorado.
[02:01:49.657 --> 02:01:50.437]  Finish up your point.
[02:01:50.437 --> 02:01:51.518]  Yeah, I didn't know that.
[02:01:51.518 --> 02:01:52.818]  I guess it's mainstream news.
[02:01:52.818 --> 02:01:53.899]  We'll put it back on screen.
[02:01:53.899 --> 02:02:02.484]  AP, Reuters, you name it, are all reporting that they are now basically delisting or moving it from the top where it should be to hiding it.
[02:02:02.484 --> 02:02:03.484]  So Google is now...
[02:02:04.805 --> 02:02:07.206]  Actually, I mean, they did this for Hillary, remember?
[02:02:07.206 --> 02:02:09.447]  They would delist stuff about her criminality there.
[02:02:09.447 --> 02:02:14.709]  There would be some about, you know, 1996 criminal bills and stuff that she signed, or Clinton signed.
[02:02:14.709 --> 02:02:15.529]  So, wow.
[02:02:15.529 --> 02:02:19.071]  Google demotes Holocaust denial and hates sites that update to algorithms.
[02:02:19.071 --> 02:02:20.391]  So that's getting in line with Germany.
[02:02:20.391 --> 02:02:21.272]  In recent months, Google has...
[02:02:21.952 --> 02:02:23.473]  All you'll do is make Google obsolete.
[02:02:23.473 --> 02:02:24.834]  Let's go back to John.
[02:02:24.834 --> 02:02:25.254]  Go ahead, John.
[02:02:49.033 --> 02:02:51.635]  That's exactly what they're doing, Alex.
[02:02:51.635 --> 02:02:52.616]  Drudge called it best.
[02:02:52.616 --> 02:02:55.698]  He said, we're all corralled into these internet ghettos.
[02:02:55.698 --> 02:02:56.979]  And that's exactly what it is.
[02:02:56.979 --> 02:02:58.921]  Google, Facebook, it doesn't matter.
[02:02:58.921 --> 02:03:02.984]  It's all a form of control that you were talking on yesterday.
[02:03:02.984 --> 02:03:05.506]  This AI control that's coming, it's already here.
[02:03:05.506 --> 02:03:07.227]  We're, it's so ubiquitous.
[02:03:07.227 --> 02:03:08.848]  We're already in it.
[02:03:08.848 --> 02:03:17.175]  And when Google does stuff like that, delist, demotes, and de-whatevers, and no one bats an eyelash,
[02:03:18.419 --> 02:03:19.700]  Because no one even notices.
[02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:21.200]  We're already so in it.
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:23.381]  Or, like you said, it's racist.
[02:03:23.381 --> 02:03:36.747]  Everyone's so afraid to be offensive towards anybody or thinking that anything... And once they train us that it's okay to ban words, then it's okay to ban entire books or ideas.
[02:03:36.747 --> 02:03:38.427]  And by the way, I've had this idea for years.
[02:03:38.427 --> 02:03:40.428]  I'm launching it now because of the attack on free speech.
[02:03:40.428 --> 02:03:41.769]  We've formed a free speech coalition.
[02:03:41.769 --> 02:03:46.031]  We've mailed off the 100,000 deals by 18 Wheeler to Trump Tower.
[02:03:46.031 --> 02:03:46.691]  That's all happening.
[02:03:48.166 --> 02:03:55.012]  But I'm going to start a $100,000 a year award, as long as we can pay for it, every year to a champion of free speech.
[02:03:55.012 --> 02:04:02.339]  But the first year's winner for 2016 will just be honorary, because Drudge wouldn't take it, $100,000.
[02:04:02.339 --> 02:04:06.142]  The first winner is Drudge for defending free speech.
[02:04:06.943 --> 02:04:08.884]  And for being an incredible journalist.
[02:04:08.884 --> 02:04:16.428]  He told us last year, from his Supreme Court sources and others, about the total attack plan for 2016, the shutdown of freedom of speech.
[02:04:16.428 --> 02:04:22.852]  He was proven correct, and so he is the first recipient of the Defense of Free Speech Awards.
[02:04:23.892 --> 02:04:32.139]  2016 and next year it'll be $100,000 and it'll be given to a journalist or group or organization that's fighting for free speech.
[02:04:32.139 --> 02:04:35.121]  We've had a $115,000 award before, by the way, folks.
[02:04:35.121 --> 02:04:37.884]  So, I mean, we pay out on these.
[02:04:37.884 --> 02:04:39.105]  But I need to go get a trophy.
[02:04:39.105 --> 02:04:41.006]  I'm going to give it to him for the year ends.
[02:04:41.006 --> 02:04:46.791]  We're going to present Drudge that here on air and kind of put clips together where he predicted it, show how it happened.
[02:04:46.791 --> 02:04:47.812]  It's just amazing.
[02:04:47.812 --> 02:04:48.913]  Where's the media going?
[02:04:48.913 --> 02:04:52.075]  Oh, look, Drudge was dead on in one interview he's done in multiple years.
[02:04:52.896 --> 02:04:53.799]  Big exclusive interview.
[02:04:53.799 --> 02:04:56.125]  They just ignore it because they know it's true.
[02:04:56.125 --> 02:04:58.772]  And he knew before we did and came to warn everybody.
[02:04:58.772 --> 02:04:59.253]  That's epic.
[02:05:01.363 --> 02:05:03.445]  A heartbreaking update this morning.
[02:05:03.445 --> 02:05:08.229]  Debbie Reynolds, age 84, mother of Carrie Fisher, has died of a suspected stroke.
[02:05:08.229 --> 02:05:11.271]  Her last words, quote, I want to be with Carrie.
[02:05:11.271 --> 02:05:18.176]  Carrie Fisher, her famous daughter, Princess Leia, of course, died of a heart attack on a flight from London to LAX earlier this week.
[02:05:18.176 --> 02:05:23.321]  Debbie Reynolds died this morning, hours after suffering a stroke, at her son Todd Fisher's house.
[02:05:23.321 --> 02:05:27.544]  The 84-year-old was planning her daughter's funeral when she suddenly took ill around 1 p.m.
[02:05:27.544 --> 02:05:28.164]  in the afternoon.
[02:05:28.164 --> 02:05:28.805]  She was rushed
[02:05:28.905 --> 02:05:34.649]  From their house in Beverly Hills to a nearby hospital, but died shortly thereafter, her son later revealed.
[02:05:34.649 --> 02:05:42.594]  Now, Todd, the last family member remaining, said that his sister's death was just simply too much for his mother, and she died longing to be with her daughter.
[02:05:42.594 --> 02:05:47.177]  Carrie Fisher died on Tuesday, four days after a heart attack on board a flight.
[02:05:47.177 --> 02:05:53.461]  And the Star Wars actor, she was in the middle of promoting her memoirs, The Diarist, and she was thought to be in good health.
[02:05:53.461 --> 02:05:54.342]  Here's what we know.
[02:05:54.342 --> 02:05:55.963]  Debbie Reynolds has died, age 84.
[02:05:55.963 --> 02:05:58.645]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for InfoWars.
[02:06:00.766 --> 02:06:08.692]  All across the Western world, MSM is attempting to demonize the language and words we use, saying, don't say Merry Christmas, use holidays.
[02:06:08.692 --> 02:06:10.213]  And now they say don't use holiday.
[02:06:10.213 --> 02:06:11.695]  Well, I've got some news for them.

[02:08:03.274 --> 02:08:05.936]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:05.936 --> 02:08:14.624]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:14.624 --> 02:08:15.945]  Escape from globalism!
[02:08:15.945 --> 02:08:18.327]  That's what's happening.
[02:08:18.327 --> 02:08:22.010]  It happened three weeks ago, got almost no media coverage.
[02:08:22.010 --> 02:08:25.934]  Before they would demonize the UK for Brexit, call them racist when the Russians were running it.
[02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:33.554]  When Merkel loses elections in Parliament, in her party, they blame it on racism and the Russians.
[02:08:33.554 --> 02:08:36.075]  But they're not blaming Italy on the Russians.
[02:08:36.075 --> 02:08:43.098]  Italy voted to not allow the EU to expand and basically dissolve its Parliament and turn them into a ceremonial body.
[02:08:43.098 --> 02:08:48.361]  The Euro's announcing that it's going to send an army that it's forming into countries that try to leave.
[02:08:48.361 --> 02:08:50.622]  This is insane how brazen this is.
[02:08:50.622 --> 02:08:55.045]  George Soros pins a piece that's linked on DrudgeReport.com on the right hand side right now
[02:08:56.158 --> 02:08:59.359]  Comparing Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler.
[02:08:59.359 --> 02:09:13.524]  Now, this is rich because George Soros, at almost 90 years old, is the most well-known living Nazi collaborator who said on 60 Minutes, quote, it was the best time of my life rounding up the Jews.
[02:09:13.524 --> 02:09:15.205]  Well, don't you feel sorry for it?
[02:09:15.205 --> 02:09:17.025]  No, because I survived.
[02:09:17.025 --> 02:09:19.606]  Totally sociopathic.
[02:09:19.606 --> 02:09:24.068]  A totally insane person who believes, he has a high intelligence, that he was going to be a messiah.
[02:09:25.319 --> 02:09:27.221]  Maybe at the end of the world.
[02:09:27.221 --> 02:09:30.384]  Now he's in full panic mode saying nationalism's rising.
[02:09:30.384 --> 02:09:32.666]  We must stop Trump at any cost.
[02:09:32.666 --> 02:09:39.373]  They're trying to start a war on Intifada, a civil war in Israel, and I watched the Situation Room last night with their fill-in host for 30 minutes.
[02:09:40.546 --> 02:09:47.150]  And they're very cryptic, they go, it will be Trump's fault now that the giant war that's coming with Russia and in the Middle East, it is his fault.
[02:09:47.150 --> 02:09:53.615]  They just kept saying, a huge war, a huge crisis, and they all said, it's too bad, and looked down, and I was like, oh my God.
[02:09:53.615 --> 02:09:58.238]  Because you know about the emails behind the scenes, they all communicate, it's very centralized.
[02:09:58.238 --> 02:10:01.480]  They're about to start a big war in the next 20 days if they can and blame it on Trump.
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:05.761]  And Obama's about to announce all these sanctions and cyber attacks on Russia.
[02:10:05.761 --> 02:10:07.302]  Russian aircraft are getting shot down.
[02:10:07.302 --> 02:10:08.883]  Ambassadors are getting killed.
[02:10:08.883 --> 02:10:11.243]  NATO top people are getting killed.
[02:10:11.243 --> 02:10:13.424]  There's a hot war going on now.
[02:10:13.424 --> 02:10:22.428]  Now, I know that Roger Stone has big international contacts, not just the Russians, but let's just say in the Middle East and in other areas in Europe.
[02:10:22.428 --> 02:10:23.768]  And he's always got his ear to the ground.
[02:10:23.768 --> 02:10:26.469]  Now, he's been out of commission for 10 days, sick as he's ever been.
[02:10:26.469 --> 02:10:29.010]  Didn't sleep hardly in the last year.
[02:10:29.010 --> 02:10:30.030]  Literally, I told her about that.
[02:10:30.030 --> 02:10:30.911]  He got really sick.
[02:10:31.591 --> 02:10:34.277]  He's been staying up for months trying to finish this book.
[02:10:34.277 --> 02:10:35.479]  So this is an exclusive interview.
[02:10:35.479 --> 02:10:37.764]  He hasn't been doing any in the last 10 days.
[02:10:37.764 --> 02:10:39.888]  Here he is, but front and center.
[02:10:40.742 --> 02:10:43.345]  I know he's been better in the last few days, kind of getting caught up.
[02:10:43.345 --> 02:10:47.169]  He can give us the latest on Trump that he's allowed to get into, and this crisis.
[02:10:47.169 --> 02:10:51.113]  But I hope Trump knows that they're coming after him in America.
[02:10:51.113 --> 02:10:59.362]  They are now basically like kamikazes who know from Italy to the UK to the United States, everybody's pulling out of globalism.
[02:10:59.362 --> 02:11:01.964]  Soros says there's an ascendant populism.
[02:11:02.705 --> 02:11:03.986]  And they're in full panic mode.
[02:11:03.986 --> 02:11:06.868]  So this is the Gouter Dameron, folks.
[02:11:06.868 --> 02:11:08.489]  This is the Ragnarok.
[02:11:08.489 --> 02:11:10.911]  This is the final battle in their view.
[02:11:10.911 --> 02:11:13.293]  This is very Hitler in the bunker.
[02:11:13.293 --> 02:11:15.494]  So they're totally inversing reality.
[02:11:15.494 --> 02:11:20.057]  He's accusing Trump of overthrowing democracies when that's his specialty.
[02:11:20.057 --> 02:11:21.819]  Good to see you, my friend on Skype.
[02:11:21.819 --> 02:11:24.380]  I gotta say, you weren't fat, but you lost some weight when you were six.
[02:11:24.380 --> 02:11:27.442]  So I guess you came out of this on the good end.
[02:11:27.442 --> 02:11:30.745]  I've always made the joke that when I get the flu occasionally, I lose 10 pounds.
[02:11:30.745 --> 02:11:31.966]  But wow, where should we start?
[02:11:32.566 --> 02:11:33.707]  Well, I'll put it this way.
[02:11:33.707 --> 02:11:36.128]  I lost weight the hard way.
[02:11:36.128 --> 02:11:47.494]  You know, Alex, I think the president-elect was hoping to have more of a working vacation at his estate, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach.
[02:11:47.494 --> 02:12:01.201]  But my understanding is he has been glued to the telephone, working the UN situation and beating back the treasury of the Obama administration there in touch with other world leaders.
[02:12:02.261 --> 02:12:12.326]  I must say, it felt really great to have a President of the United States who's actually willing to tweet, Merry Christmas, rather than Happy Holidays.
[02:12:12.326 --> 02:12:30.656]  And I wish that the President-elect could get the kind of rest and recreation or more golf, but he's very plugged in to the world situation, which I think you can see in this statement this morning, in which he essentially says, hold on Israel, help is coming.
[02:12:33.024 --> 02:12:35.286]  What do you make geopolitically?
[02:12:35.286 --> 02:12:39.250]  The Democrats pretty much admit they're trying to cause a war to embarrass Trump.
[02:12:39.250 --> 02:12:44.095]  They should be brought up in charges if they actually cause this war and try to bring down the economy.
[02:12:44.095 --> 02:12:47.618]  They admit they want to raise interest rates to stall the Trump euphoria.
[02:12:47.618 --> 02:12:48.840]  They're in full panic mode.
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:51.722]  The world is so hungry for prosperity.
[02:12:51.722 --> 02:12:54.145]  Trump's turning out even better than we thought and he's still 21 days out.
[02:12:55.986 --> 02:13:02.692]  And they made an enormous investment in an attempt to hijack the Electoral College.
[02:13:02.692 --> 02:13:12.802]  They made an enormous investment, $3.5 million to the state of Wisconsin for the phony recount that yielded nothing.
[02:13:13.502 --> 02:13:16.603]  After harping on the popular vote.
[02:13:16.603 --> 02:13:23.465]  So at each stop, their plan to upset the apple cart and remove Donald Trump has failed.
[02:13:23.465 --> 02:13:36.870]  This is why I think you're seeing this kind of hysteria generated once again by Mr. Soros.
[02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:40.231]  I brought up some points here and I want to get back into questions I've got, Roger, but
[02:13:41.152 --> 02:13:47.276]  Obviously, I think you got better the last few days, so you were reassessing what was happening currently.
[02:13:47.276 --> 02:13:48.676]  What else should we be looking for?
[02:13:48.676 --> 02:13:52.118]  What else should we be on the outlook for, obviously?
[02:13:52.118 --> 02:13:54.820]  Because there's good things happening, there's bad things happening.
[02:13:54.820 --> 02:14:03.145]  We see the ruling class that's hijacked the country and the world panicking because they see a return of prosperity, something that they've been admitting they have to
[02:14:04.626 --> 02:14:16.692]  Well, let's remember that President-elect Trump is still trying to form a government.
[02:14:16.692 --> 02:14:21.694]  He still has to name a Secretary of Agriculture.
[02:14:21.694 --> 02:14:28.297]  He still has to name somebody to straighten out the mess at the Veterans Administration.
[02:14:28.297 --> 02:14:31.359]  I do know that he is very, very focused on the VA.
[02:14:32.279 --> 02:14:40.425]  He's very focused on looking at innovative programs to finance an infrastructure rebuilding across the country.
[02:14:40.425 --> 02:14:47.089]  These, combined with his economic plan, I think are the main focus here.
[02:14:47.089 --> 02:14:55.174]  And having known him almost 40 years, the word can't does not exist in his lexicon.
[02:14:55.174 --> 02:14:56.996]  He just says he's an American.
[02:14:56.996 --> 02:14:59.377]  All things are possible.
[02:14:59.377 --> 02:15:01.479]  And therefore, he is deeply committed
[02:15:02.359 --> 02:15:05.502]  I know the experts have told him the VA system can't be fixed.
[02:15:05.502 --> 02:15:06.724]  Can't be fixed.
[02:15:06.724 --> 02:15:10.087]  He doesn't believe it and he's going to fix it.
[02:15:10.087 --> 02:15:20.918]  It is so refreshing to have a political figure who wins office and then actually intends to do the things he said he was going to do in the election.
[02:15:21.138 --> 02:15:21.878]  Well, that's right.
[02:15:21.878 --> 02:15:27.522]  Well, Trump understands what's really going on because he battled big cities and corrupt machines all over the country.
[02:15:27.522 --> 02:15:42.070]  And I've had all the top experts on from the VA, even former deputy heads, and they say, look, we're here to social engineer the vets, make sure they don't actually get what they're supposed to do, and basically list them all as mentally ill so they can politically have their rights taken.
[02:15:42.070 --> 02:15:44.352]  So it's been deliberately sabotaged.
[02:15:44.952 --> 02:15:49.336]  That's why, I mean, the amount of money spent, they should all be treated like kings and queens.
[02:15:49.336 --> 02:15:58.783]  And so, just taking the foot off the troops' necks, and just allowing the actual funds to get to them, will bring in the doctors, bring in the people we need.
[02:15:58.783 --> 02:15:59.864]  So that's what this is about.
[02:15:59.864 --> 02:16:00.705]  It's like healthcare.
[02:16:00.705 --> 02:16:03.307]  We had the best in the world, until they started sabotaging it.
[02:16:04.462 --> 02:16:06.503]  I think that's exactly right.
[02:16:06.503 --> 02:16:09.465]  It is probably the number one national scandal.
[02:16:09.465 --> 02:16:12.726]  It's something that I know keeps Trump up late at night.
[02:16:12.726 --> 02:16:15.588]  It's something he feels very deeply about.
[02:16:15.588 --> 02:16:18.309]  And you're going to get progress in this area.
[02:16:18.309 --> 02:16:22.451]  But he's got an entire government to reform.
[02:16:22.451 --> 02:16:23.172]  For example,
[02:16:24.112 --> 02:16:33.815]  Under the Democrats, the Interior Department, specifically the Bureau of Indian Affairs, has become a money machine for the Democratic National Party.
[02:16:33.815 --> 02:16:34.195]  That's right.
[02:16:34.195 --> 02:16:41.677]  Nothing against the Native Americans and their casinos, but they give, what, 95% I was reading just last week in the Wall Street Journal to the Democrats.
[02:16:41.677 --> 02:16:45.378]  Sorry, you don't have foreign governments that get to do things that other people can't.
[02:16:45.618 --> 02:16:49.581]  And then you use it to manipulate our country and take our guns and our freedom.
[02:16:49.581 --> 02:16:51.082]  Sorry, Native Americans!
[02:16:51.082 --> 02:16:51.463]  Sorry!
[02:16:51.463 --> 02:16:54.585]  You can make billions of dollars, but not at the expense of my freedom!
[02:16:54.585 --> 02:16:56.346]  That's exactly right.
[02:16:56.346 --> 02:17:02.931]  So, believe it or not, the number one donor to the Democratic National Party is the trial bar.
[02:17:02.931 --> 02:17:05.714]  Number two are the Indian casinos.
[02:17:05.714 --> 02:17:07.855]  Number three is organized labor.
[02:17:07.855 --> 02:17:11.158]  That is where we have gotten to.
[02:17:11.158 --> 02:17:12.419]  And the truth is that
[02:17:14.451 --> 02:17:17.173]  90% of the cash... Hold on, we got an emergency!
[02:17:17.173 --> 02:17:18.433]  We got an emergency!
[02:17:18.433 --> 02:17:19.634]  This is much worse than we thought.
[02:17:19.634 --> 02:17:21.335]  We knew they were trying to start a war with Russia.
[02:17:21.335 --> 02:17:26.498]  They just expelled the Russian diplomats and closed Russian embassies here in the U.S.
[02:17:26.498 --> 02:17:30.179]  That was not even done during the Cuban Missile Crisis or during the Cold War.
[02:17:30.179 --> 02:17:38.064]  This is something you do when you go to DEFCON 2, Defense Condition 2, or maybe even 1, which means, I mean, this is total insanity, Reuters.
[02:17:38.064 --> 02:17:38.624]  Oh my God!
[02:17:38.624 --> 02:17:40.325]  This is a coup against America to stop Trump!
[02:17:40.985 --> 02:17:42.909]  Oh, this is ten times worse than I thought.
[02:17:42.909 --> 02:17:53.627]  The United States on Thursday expelled 35 Russian diplomats and closed two Russian compounds in New York and Maryland in response to a campaign of harassment by Russia against American diplomats in Moscow.
[02:17:55.140 --> 02:17:55.880]  A senior U.S.
[02:17:55.880 --> 02:17:59.382]  official said on Thursday, wow, the U.S.
[02:17:59.382 --> 02:18:01.263]  official speaking on condition of anonymity.
[02:18:01.263 --> 02:18:02.664]  We've seen U.S.
[02:18:02.664 --> 02:18:05.065]  diplomats try to run into their embassies and infiltrate.
[02:18:05.065 --> 02:18:05.425]  The U.S.
[02:18:05.425 --> 02:18:10.868]  official speaking on condition of anonymity told Reuters the Russian diplomats would be given 72 hours to leave the United States.
[02:18:10.868 --> 02:18:13.789]  Access to two compounds will be denied to all Russian officials.
[02:18:13.789 --> 02:18:15.570]  As of noon Friday, the official added.
[02:18:15.570 --> 02:18:18.672]  So this is unprecedented, Roger.
[02:18:18.672 --> 02:18:20.072]  You were in the Nixon administration.
[02:18:20.072 --> 02:18:21.593]  You were in the Reagan administration.
[02:18:21.593 --> 02:18:22.314]  I mean, when we were
[02:18:23.832 --> 02:18:26.294]  On the edge of, you know, nuclear war, this crap didn't go on.
[02:18:26.294 --> 02:18:28.395]  This is unprecedented.
[02:18:28.395 --> 02:18:31.718]  The obviousness of it is what's so astounding.
[02:18:31.718 --> 02:18:33.559]  It is so blatant.
[02:18:33.559 --> 02:18:43.546]  I mean, this reminds me of Joe Biden chortling about the cyber war that we're going to use to provoke the Russians.
[02:18:43.546 --> 02:18:46.188]  Does Trump need to tell them to stop it right now?
[02:18:46.188 --> 02:18:50.371]  I mean, we need to start... I mean, this is an act of war right here.
[02:18:50.371 --> 02:18:51.411]  This is what... I mean...
[02:18:52.532 --> 02:18:56.713]  You shut down embassies once war starts!
[02:18:56.713 --> 02:19:00.234]  The problem, of course, is that the administration wouldn't listen.
[02:19:00.234 --> 02:19:10.897]  Just yesterday in an interview, President Obama says that had he run against Donald Trump, he's confident that he would have beaten him.
[02:19:10.897 --> 02:19:19.300]  What happened to the American tradition of the outgoing president not criticizing the incoming president and vice versa?
[02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:24.442]  It has been a bipartisan tradition in this country since the beginning of time.
[02:19:24.442 --> 02:19:25.202]  Roger, Roger.
[02:19:25.202 --> 02:19:32.784]  I mean, look, they would only invoke and claim the Russians had taken over through Trump if they were planning to engage COG and have martial law and war.
[02:19:32.784 --> 02:19:33.964]  I said that three weeks ago.
[02:19:33.964 --> 02:19:35.905]  It got picked up internationally.
[02:19:35.905 --> 02:19:36.805]  I mean, I've studied COG.
[02:19:36.805 --> 02:19:38.486]  We're going to skip this break, guys.
[02:19:39.562 --> 02:19:40.603]  I'm going to have to skip all of them here.
[02:19:40.603 --> 02:19:41.524]  We're about to have a nuclear war.
[02:19:41.524 --> 02:19:46.507]  This, in my knowledge, Roger, let's get on this right now and get Watson on it too.
[02:19:46.507 --> 02:19:56.895]  I don't believe they've ever done something like this where they close diplomatic compounds that are already established without having a congressional law that just changes where they can have them.
[02:19:56.895 --> 02:19:59.037]  And that's not been done even during the Cold War.
[02:19:59.037 --> 02:20:00.598]  Roger, this is unprecedented.
[02:20:00.598 --> 02:20:03.620]  These actions were taken to respond to Russian harassment of American diplomats.
[02:20:03.620 --> 02:20:04.260]  See, no proof.
[02:20:04.260 --> 02:20:05.301]  Now it's not hacking.
[02:20:05.301 --> 02:20:05.942]  Now it's harassment.
[02:20:06.581 --> 02:20:10.544]  Yeah, who exactly are these diplomats and why was that not reported at the time?
[02:20:10.544 --> 02:20:18.048]  And the actions by diplomats that have been assessed to be not consistent with diplomatic practice, the officials told Russia.
[02:20:18.048 --> 02:20:20.070]  I mean, this is just the beginning.
[02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:22.631]  They're saying they're going to launch a cyber war on Russia.
[02:20:22.631 --> 02:20:23.952]  I guess turn their lights off?
[02:20:23.952 --> 02:20:25.794]  Maybe turn a nuclear power plant off?
[02:20:25.794 --> 02:20:26.974]  And then we'll have another Chernobyl?
[02:20:26.974 --> 02:20:29.176]  What, just have a frickin' nuclear war here, Roger?
[02:20:29.975 --> 02:20:34.077]  Anything is possible under this administration.
[02:20:34.077 --> 02:20:40.901]  And the hysteria they are experienced because they see Donald Trump dissembling the New World Order.
[02:20:40.901 --> 02:20:50.607]  Well, I said last night, I watched CNN and they had the look of people around a death watch where they went, something big is about to happen, war, and it's Trump's fault, and they went.
[02:20:51.207 --> 02:20:53.589]  It's his fault, knowing it's all them doing it.
[02:20:53.589 --> 02:20:55.211]  And then they just went, so be it.
[02:20:55.211 --> 02:20:57.973]  And I was like watching what I saw before 9-11 on CNN again.
[02:21:01.789 --> 02:21:03.271]  And they said something big is going to happen.
[02:21:03.271 --> 02:21:04.512]  Big towers are going to come down.
[02:21:04.512 --> 02:21:05.633]  Our lives are going to be the same.
[02:21:05.633 --> 02:21:07.235]  We're going to change the way we have freedoms.
[02:21:07.235 --> 02:21:08.477]  There's going to be a big war.
[02:21:08.477 --> 02:21:14.364]  And it was the Hart-Rubin Commission, Gary Hart and Warren Redman, on... No, no, it was CNBC.
[02:21:14.364 --> 02:21:15.425]  It was Hardball.
[02:21:15.425 --> 02:21:20.551]  And they were telling that 9-11 was coming and the world would never be the same on July 24th.
[02:21:21.963 --> 02:21:24.906]  And I came out and said they're going to blow up the World Trade Center, blame it on Bin Laden.
[02:21:24.906 --> 02:21:32.014]  I'm seeing the same weird criminal energy now on the TV channels as they prepare for something big, Roger.
[02:21:32.014 --> 02:21:33.496]  And Roger, you know I don't just say stuff.
[02:21:33.496 --> 02:21:35.037]  I mean, everything's aligning.
[02:21:35.037 --> 02:21:36.519]  I think they're going to try a coup.
[02:21:36.519 --> 02:21:38.321]  I think we're in an emergency situation right now.
[02:21:39.681 --> 02:21:41.602]  I agree with you.
[02:21:41.602 --> 02:21:46.284]  I'm particularly concerned about the President's security.
[02:21:46.284 --> 02:21:50.306]  He is hunkered down at his place in Palm Beach.
[02:21:50.306 --> 02:21:55.469]  But as each day gets closer to January 20th, the hysteria level
[02:21:56.269 --> 02:21:59.171]  Just ratchets up, up, up.
[02:21:59.171 --> 02:22:04.476]  So I think that these are desperate times and these are desperate people who will do desperate things.
[02:22:04.476 --> 02:22:05.317]  Let's be clear.
[02:22:05.317 --> 02:22:07.418]  If we were reading about this 50 years ago in U.S.
[02:22:07.418 --> 02:22:09.060]  history, there'd be thousands of books.
[02:22:09.060 --> 02:22:10.601]  It'd be the number one thing ever.
[02:22:10.601 --> 02:22:19.028]  The battle, the war, the Democrats not leaving, being funded by foreign powers, claiming that another president who wasn't was funded by it.
[02:22:19.028 --> 02:22:22.531]  I mean, they're the ones that have the Indian casinos putting money into Hillary.
[02:22:22.731 --> 02:22:26.195]  They're the ones with the Saudi Arabians bragging they gave 20%.
[02:22:26.195 --> 02:22:31.841]  They're the ones in the WikiLeaks involved in all the crime and all the foreign collusion and all the foreign money.
[02:22:31.841 --> 02:22:40.370]  Then they're blaming America, wanting our sovereignty back on the Russians and claiming if Merkel's voted out, they're going to ignore the vote because the Russians did that too!
[02:22:40.370 --> 02:22:42.312]  I mean, this is crazy!
[02:22:42.893 --> 02:22:56.136]  They have to be very disappointed in the fact that only 29% of the American people have bought the entire fraudulent argument that the Russians hacked and somehow affected our election.
[02:22:56.136 --> 02:23:01.357]  This was their big move and it has failed as a Git prop.
[02:23:01.357 --> 02:23:05.358]  It has failed as a Git prop and now they're going to take it to the next level.
[02:23:05.658 --> 02:23:08.640]  I agree, Roger, so let me ask you this question.
[02:23:08.640 --> 02:23:09.481]  What does Trump do?
[02:23:09.481 --> 02:23:10.121]  What do we do?
[02:23:10.121 --> 02:23:11.702]  These are abject lying criminals.
[02:23:11.702 --> 02:23:12.723]  We have the WikiLeaks.
[02:23:12.723 --> 02:23:14.123]  They're completely insane.
[02:23:14.123 --> 02:23:15.484]  They're trying to start a war with Russia.
[02:23:15.484 --> 02:23:19.007]  They clearly shot down the airplane, and the other one as well, the service-to-air missile.
[02:23:19.007 --> 02:23:20.227]  There's footage of that.
[02:23:20.227 --> 02:23:21.368]  They're killing diplomats.
[02:23:21.368 --> 02:23:23.810]  They're hurdling towards war.
[02:23:23.810 --> 02:23:27.872]  They've got Keith Olbermann calling for war with Russia, screaming Russian scum.
[02:23:27.872 --> 02:23:28.693]  This is insane!
[02:23:29.892 --> 02:23:42.246]  Well, the good news, of course, is that the president has surrounded himself with a solid group of advisors like General James Mad Dog Mattis, General Flynn.
[02:23:42.246 --> 02:23:44.469]  So he's not out there alone.
[02:23:44.469 --> 02:23:46.931]  I guarantee you he is huddled with his advisors.
[02:23:47.732 --> 02:23:52.458]  I mean, do they understand the magnitude of what's currently happening?
[02:23:52.458 --> 02:24:02.471]  Because I understand they want to be, you know, fixing America, getting us jobs, trying to prove they're nice guys, while the freaking demons are planning to start nuclear war and openly cause an Intifada to overthrow Israel.
[02:24:03.577 --> 02:24:14.664]  Again, I think that the establishment types have been so brazen, so obvious in their moves, that they're entirely on President Trump's radar screen now.
[02:24:14.664 --> 02:24:20.448]  I think he knows exactly what's going on, and I, too, am counting the minutes before he takes office.
[02:24:20.448 --> 02:24:21.889]  Gosh!
[02:24:21.889 --> 02:24:23.229]  I think they're crazy enough.
[02:24:23.229 --> 02:24:27.832]  I mean, they got Soros, who commands this whole thing, saying he's Hitler, and he must be stopped.
[02:24:27.832 --> 02:24:29.713]  What do you make of that?
[02:24:29.713 --> 02:24:32.095]  This has been a trend that you spotted from the beginning.
[02:24:33.436 --> 02:24:43.042]  All along the way, they have accused us of exactly what they are doing, at every step of the process, from the beginning.
[02:24:43.042 --> 02:24:50.326]  So they're the ones who would like to stage a Hitler-like coup, but we blame that on Donald Trump.
[02:24:50.326 --> 02:24:51.827]  It's Kafka-esque.
[02:24:51.827 --> 02:24:55.730]  I mean, it is, it's, it's Alice in Wonderland.
[02:24:55.730 --> 02:24:57.311]  It's upside down world.
[02:24:57.311 --> 02:24:57.851]  It really is.
[02:24:57.851 --> 02:24:59.052]  It really is.
[02:25:01.658 --> 02:25:04.980]  Roger, again, I don't want to be hysteric here.
[02:25:04.980 --> 02:25:07.482]  This is hysterical.
[02:25:07.482 --> 02:25:10.585]  I've read hundreds of books on the whole Russian thing, like you have.
[02:25:10.585 --> 02:25:11.886]  The Cold War, it's so interesting.
[02:25:11.886 --> 02:25:14.627]  I've seen countless Discovery Channel and History Channel shows.
[02:25:14.627 --> 02:25:19.331]  I've had a bunch of guests on about it, you know, the Venona Secrets and all of it.
[02:25:19.331 --> 02:25:20.972]  I mean, I've never seen them.
[02:25:22.972 --> 02:25:26.474]  Google expelling Russian diplomats in history.
[02:25:26.474 --> 02:25:27.314]  Or has the U.S.
[02:25:27.314 --> 02:25:28.514]  expelled diplomats before?
[02:25:28.514 --> 02:25:33.016]  They've expelled them that were known spies doing illegal things.
[02:25:33.016 --> 02:25:39.559]  But to just expel whole buildings, claiming some nebulous thing, Roger, have you ever heard of this?
[02:25:39.559 --> 02:25:40.560]  It's a provocation.
[02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:44.201]  I've never seen anything like it historically.
[02:25:44.201 --> 02:25:48.423]  And it is something that the President has to stay on top of.
[02:25:49.278 --> 02:25:50.319]  Well, they're planning something.
[02:25:50.319 --> 02:25:55.364]  I saw the arrogance return to the CNN operatives that we know are CIA, the bad group CIA.
[02:25:55.364 --> 02:25:58.027]  I saw the arrogance come back last night and they're planning something big.
[02:25:58.027 --> 02:26:01.971]  And, you know, they're like, well, he's got to handle the fact that the Russians put him in.
[02:26:01.971 --> 02:26:03.172]  And there's about to be a big war.
[02:26:03.172 --> 02:26:03.793]  It's his fault.
[02:26:03.793 --> 02:26:05.214]  They're all like, yep.
[02:26:05.214 --> 02:26:07.776]  And they look very satisfied talking about the president suddenly.
[02:26:07.776 --> 02:26:09.979]  And they've got some evil plan.
[02:26:09.979 --> 02:26:12.882]  And my God, I just, I don't know what to say, Roger.
[02:26:14.232 --> 02:26:20.377]  Alex, I'm going to head back to the computer because I've got a tight deadline for my book, The Making of the President 2016.
[02:26:20.377 --> 02:26:28.124]  And I should add, I'm trying to include these very events that we're talking about in the book.
[02:26:28.124 --> 02:26:33.548]  In other words, until the book closes, I am going to bring this right up to the second
[02:26:34.869 --> 02:26:36.690]  Sure, and it's historical and you've got a blueprint.
[02:26:36.690 --> 02:26:40.931]  But listen, before you go in the last few minutes we have left here, other things that are on the radar.
[02:26:40.931 --> 02:26:43.232]  What else can we as citizens do?
[02:26:43.232 --> 02:26:46.112]  Call in to talk radio, point this is happening.
[02:26:46.112 --> 02:26:50.734]  I mean, how do we expose this insanity?
[02:26:50.734 --> 02:26:53.214]  The best way, of course, is I think do exactly that.
[02:26:53.214 --> 02:26:57.035]  To call in to radio shows like this one.
[02:26:57.035 --> 02:27:01.917]  And to work the social media very hard while we still have it.
[02:27:02.813 --> 02:27:05.396]  Twitter, Facebook, Gab.
[02:27:05.396 --> 02:27:09.340]  These are powerful, powerful tools.
[02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:19.031]  And we know that our critics and those who would overturn this election would like to shut us down from these social media outlets.
[02:27:19.031 --> 02:27:20.773]  So take to the ramparts.
[02:27:21.474 --> 02:27:22.535]  Use your Twitter feed.
[02:27:22.535 --> 02:27:23.636]  Use your Facebook feed.
[02:27:23.636 --> 02:27:24.237]  That's right.
[02:27:24.237 --> 02:27:28.700]  And also our own URL, StoneColdTruth.com, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:27:28.700 --> 02:27:32.944]  Those are going to become more and more important as they delist us, block us, and the rest of it.
[02:27:32.944 --> 02:27:33.885]  It's now here.
[02:27:33.885 --> 02:27:35.146]  Roger, thank you.
[02:27:35.146 --> 02:27:36.187]  Great to be here again.
[02:27:36.187 --> 02:27:37.048]  Thanks.
[02:27:37.048 --> 02:27:37.668]  Pre-order the book.
[02:27:37.668 --> 02:27:39.970]  When's the book coming out in the next couple months?
[02:27:39.970 --> 02:27:45.875]  The book has to be turned in by the 1st, and it should be out around the time of the inauguration.
[02:27:45.875 --> 02:27:46.416]  Amazing.
[02:27:46.416 --> 02:27:46.716]  All right.
[02:27:46.716 --> 02:27:47.456]  Thank you so much.
[02:27:48.217 --> 02:27:49.299]  Thank you.
[02:27:49.299 --> 02:27:51.743]  You can pre-order the book now on Amazon.com, his website as well.
[02:27:51.743 --> 02:27:54.788]  We're now pre-selling it at m4store.com.
[02:27:54.788 --> 02:27:58.795]  Let me just state the most important thing of the broadcast today, okay?
[02:27:58.795 --> 02:28:00.478]  I'm going to state it right now.
[02:28:00.478 --> 02:28:01.700]  Everybody's about to go to break.
[02:28:01.700 --> 02:28:02.001]  Come back.
[02:28:03.757 --> 02:28:12.766]  It looks comical for them saying the election was stolen by Russians and we're all Russian spies and they just passed a law last Friday to start censoring media they claim is connected to the Russians.
[02:28:12.766 --> 02:28:19.934]  And turn loose the Board of Governors under the FCC under CIA command to shut down the Internet, you name it.
[02:28:19.934 --> 02:28:21.435]  That's a huge story that the Internet
[02:28:22.156 --> 02:28:33.072]  Print media, satellite, all that they're claiming is down to the FCC under the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 and they admit that they're going to censor.
[02:28:33.072 --> 02:28:36.077]  Now the censorship is already beginning at Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
[02:28:37.449 --> 02:28:41.310]  They're not going to bring in total censorship until they start a war.
[02:28:41.310 --> 02:28:44.110]  And then it's, oh see, we're rounding up the Russian agents.
[02:28:44.110 --> 02:28:50.631]  This is just so historic, so brazen, so naked, so insane.
[02:28:50.631 --> 02:28:52.612]  And it's sure to cause a civil war.
[02:28:52.612 --> 02:28:55.052]  They miscalculated with Hillary.
[02:28:55.052 --> 02:28:56.733]  They miscalculated with the polls.
[02:28:56.733 --> 02:28:58.573]  They miscalculated on Wikileaks.
[02:28:58.573 --> 02:29:01.273]  They're run by this crazy old Nazi collaborator.
[02:29:01.273 --> 02:29:04.694]  And they're planning to not let Trump get into office and start a war with Russia.
[02:29:06.428 --> 02:29:08.349]  And they're willing to start a nuclear war before that.
[02:29:08.349 --> 02:29:10.630]  They're willing to overthrow Israel!
[02:29:10.630 --> 02:29:15.172]  Basically saying to the Arabs, start attacking Israel!
[02:29:15.172 --> 02:29:15.592]  U.S.
[02:29:15.592 --> 02:29:17.513]  expels 35 Russian diplomats.
[02:29:17.513 --> 02:29:18.653]  Closes two compounds.
[02:29:18.653 --> 02:29:20.094]  Give me everything we've got on this.
[02:29:20.094 --> 02:29:21.715]  And they say more is going to start happening.
[02:29:21.715 --> 02:29:26.157]  This is unbelievable!
[02:29:26.157 --> 02:29:30.119]  Kicking Russians out of the United States from embassies.
[02:29:30.119 --> 02:29:30.959]  Wow!
[02:29:30.959 --> 02:29:32.820]  That is, that's what you do when you're in a war.
[02:29:34.272 --> 02:29:38.234]  In fact, you never do it until the war starts and then you close the embassy.
[02:29:38.234 --> 02:29:39.575]  Wow.
[02:29:39.575 --> 02:29:41.977]  So, I told you they're gonna start a war.
[02:29:41.977 --> 02:29:42.377]  This is it.
[02:29:42.377 --> 02:29:43.658]  It's what all the leftists want.
[02:29:43.658 --> 02:29:45.239]  They want nuclear war and death.
[02:29:45.239 --> 02:29:46.279]  They're a death cult.
[02:29:46.279 --> 02:29:47.580]  They love abortion.
[02:29:47.580 --> 02:29:50.422]  They're demons.
[02:29:50.422 --> 02:29:51.803]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.803 --> 02:29:54.324]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.324 --> 02:29:57.006]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.919 --> 02:30:05.840]  Just how much are the Obama family's vacations costing the American taxpayer?
[02:30:05.840 --> 02:30:10.961]  Well, eight years of his vacations, a whopping $85 million, one report suggests.
[02:30:10.961 --> 02:30:18.503]  This American family, it's enjoying vacations like Hawaiian vacations, for example, with a price tag of an annual trip of $3.5 million or more.
[02:30:18.503 --> 02:30:25.464]  In total, the cost of the first family's personal travel during the last years comes to a whopping $85 million.
[02:30:25.464 --> 02:30:30.145]  $90 million after additional records were released, according to one conservative group, Judicial Watch.
[02:30:30.285 --> 02:30:32.967]  And this is, of course, based on the federal government's records.
[02:30:32.967 --> 02:30:43.594]  The cost of Air Force One and other government planes, as well as helicopters, cargo planes, armored planes, Secret Service protection, advanced communications, medical staff, of course, is responsible for the bulk of this money.
[02:30:43.594 --> 02:30:49.557]  Directly quoting Judicial Watch here, the Secret Service and the Air Force are being abused by unnecessary travel.
[02:30:49.557 --> 02:30:53.960]  The average American family couldn't even afford to take a vacation this past year.
[02:30:53.960 --> 02:30:55.801]  We're working too hard, but don't worry.
[02:30:55.801 --> 02:30:57.843]  The First Family is going to do it for you.
[02:30:57.843 --> 02:30:59.444]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for InfoWars.
[02:30:59.684 --> 02:31:00.144]  I think so.

[02:32:00.740 --> 02:32:10.007]  As we get ready to kick off 2017, it's more important than ever to realize it's the First Amendment that allowed us to defeat the globalist witch Hillary Clinton.
[02:32:10.007 --> 02:32:15.031]  And these enemies of free speech are out there telling us, don't say Merry Christmas, in fact, don't even say holidays.
[02:32:15.031 --> 02:32:16.372]  Well, I got news for them.
[02:32:16.372 --> 02:32:24.177]  Just because of them doing that, I'm going to extend our Christmas sales right through into 2017.
[02:32:24.177 --> 02:32:26.379]  We're talking store-wide free shipping and
[02:32:26.959 --> 02:32:30.440]  50 to 25% off on the Nutraceuticals and so much more.
[02:32:30.440 --> 02:32:42.442]  So whether it's a Hillary for Prison 2017 shirt or whether it's Survival Shield X2 or Supermail Vitality, we've got the biggest sales of 2016 right into 2017 while supplies last.
[02:32:42.442 --> 02:32:46.763]  We are selling out of many of these items because this sale is so big and we've extended it.
[02:32:46.763 --> 02:32:48.163]  So please take advantage of this.
[02:32:48.163 --> 02:32:55.665]  And again, thank you for fighting for the Infowar and supporting our operation and supporting not just the First Amendment, but free speech worldwide.
[02:32:55.925 --> 02:32:59.777]  That's InfowarsStore.com or go right to the supplements at InfowarsLive.com
[02:33:14.683 --> 02:33:25.006]  Okay, my memory did serve.
[02:33:25.006 --> 02:33:28.708]  I knew that there had been expelling of diplomats going back during the Cold War back and forth.
[02:33:28.708 --> 02:33:31.849]  They said you're really a KGB agent or you're really CIA.
[02:33:31.849 --> 02:33:35.630]  But it's unprecedented to close entire buildings and entire centers.
[02:33:35.630 --> 02:33:36.310]  That's what's happening.
[02:33:36.310 --> 02:33:37.050]  This is just the beginning.
[02:33:37.050 --> 02:33:39.131]  Obama's seeing cyber attacks, you name it.
[02:33:39.131 --> 02:33:41.612]  What really matters is Russia's not been proven.
[02:33:43.473 --> 02:33:46.155]  First, the intelligence agency said, no, that's not true, it's being made up.
[02:33:46.155 --> 02:33:51.718]  Then Obama went in and basically ordered them to say, well, they might have influenced things, but didn't physically hack.
[02:33:51.718 --> 02:33:59.543]  This is while we have everything from the Native American casinos being the, what, second or third biggest donor to the Democrats.
[02:33:59.543 --> 02:34:02.384]  That's a sovereign nation, with money.
[02:34:02.384 --> 02:34:05.006]  To the communist Chinese and Saudi Arabians bragging.
[02:34:05.006 --> 02:34:08.468]  I mean, look at all the world leaders saying you can't have Trump.
[02:34:08.468 --> 02:34:09.529]  It's just crazy!
[02:34:10.751 --> 02:34:15.096]  And now, oh, the Italians don't want the EU to take over because you're Russian agents.
[02:34:15.096 --> 02:34:17.558]  We may send in the EU army.
[02:34:17.558 --> 02:34:19.801]  You never voted to enter the EU.
[02:34:19.801 --> 02:34:22.744]  You say, we want out, and they go, you work for Russia.
[02:34:22.744 --> 02:34:24.126]  We have to send tanks in.
[02:34:24.126 --> 02:34:28.350]  No, globalists control the EU, the North American Union, the rest of it.
[02:34:28.350 --> 02:34:29.251]  They're trying to take over.
[02:34:29.251 --> 02:34:31.774]  Meanwhile, they're the ones flooding us with jihadis.
[02:34:31.774 --> 02:34:32.394]  Now, I have
[02:34:33.315 --> 02:34:40.560]  The crew here, Ashley Begford and of course Leanne McAdoo and Margaret Howell here in our two studios.
[02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:43.162]  If you're a radio listener, you'll just think like we're all, you know, one big free-for-all.
[02:34:43.162 --> 02:34:47.985]  But for TV viewers, InfoWars.com forward slash show obviously has the 24-7 feed.
[02:34:47.985 --> 02:34:49.126]  When we're live, it's live.
[02:34:49.126 --> 02:34:53.048]  There's also free iPhone, Droid apps and so much more there on that page.
[02:34:53.048 --> 02:34:58.192]  It's a great page to send on to folks in the InfoWar since we're getting blocked and censored more and more because we're effective.
[02:34:58.192 --> 02:34:59.653]  So be sure and do that.
[02:34:59.653 --> 02:35:00.553]  We were going to get into
[02:35:01.454 --> 02:35:10.278]  What's in AP Reuters and others, I've got the article right here about how the Spanish government's saying ISIS and others are recruiting and getting money in Latin America.
[02:35:10.278 --> 02:35:12.980]  Well, that's what the head of South Com said two years ago.
[02:35:12.980 --> 02:35:18.542]  And the Border Patrol, thousands a month of other than Mexican coming across, mainly from the Middle East and China.
[02:35:18.542 --> 02:35:20.243]  So, the border's just wide open.
[02:35:20.243 --> 02:35:22.124]  Disease comes across, you name it.
[02:35:22.124 --> 02:35:24.525]  They know you have TB, they let you come across.
[02:35:24.525 --> 02:35:27.407]  If I had drug-resistant TB and I flew, it's a felony.
[02:35:28.234 --> 02:35:32.377]  But the Border Patrol is ordered to let people cross with leprosy!
[02:35:32.377 --> 02:35:34.518]  And I tell you this, years ago, you'd say, oh, that's not true.
[02:35:34.518 --> 02:35:35.839]  I was being told by the Border Patrol.
[02:35:35.839 --> 02:35:37.481]  We'd blur their faces out.
[02:35:37.481 --> 02:35:41.123]  Now the Border Patrol doesn't care, even if they get arrested by Obama.
[02:35:41.123 --> 02:35:43.545]  They go on TV and tell us what's happening.
[02:35:43.545 --> 02:35:46.767]  The head of the Border Patrol in South Texas comes on, because they care.
[02:35:46.767 --> 02:35:48.569]  They realize the country's so far gone.
[02:35:49.329 --> 02:35:51.031]  So, this is just crazy town.
[02:35:51.031 --> 02:35:55.676]  So to discuss what we think is behind all this are three of our great reporters.
[02:35:55.676 --> 02:35:58.279]  Leanne and everybody just chime in free for all here ladies.
[02:35:58.279 --> 02:36:00.040]  As you know, I'm like a warthog.
[02:36:00.040 --> 02:36:02.043]  I'll just get in here and keep ranting.
[02:36:02.043 --> 02:36:08.650]  What do you make of this Russia escalation and all the craziness and laws being signed saying basically we're Russian agents?
[02:36:09.386 --> 02:36:14.767]  Well, I think what people really need to understand is that we are being ruled by sociopaths.
[02:36:14.767 --> 02:36:22.269]  I mean, we have sociopaths in power who that's all they care about is power and control, and they're not willing to relinquish that.
[02:36:22.269 --> 02:36:29.451]  And they're freaking out over the fact that Donald Trump is going to take office, which means prison for them if he dares to come after them.
[02:36:29.451 --> 02:36:33.572]  Like you said earlier, he needs to let George Soros know, I'm coming after you.
[02:36:33.572 --> 02:36:35.232]  You're the number one priority on my list.
[02:36:35.692 --> 02:36:38.535]  The fact that he's being so nice is only emboldening these people.
[02:36:38.535 --> 02:36:39.396]  Exactly.
[02:36:39.396 --> 02:36:44.901]  And, you know, the fact that we've got, like, the Council on Foreign Relations fearing collapse of the UN under President Trump.
[02:36:44.901 --> 02:36:48.124]  I mean, they are freaked out that he's going to cut the funding.
[02:36:48.124 --> 02:36:50.366]  That's, you know... It's like a James Bond movie.
[02:36:50.366 --> 02:36:53.449]  The reclusive Matt Drudge does, like, one interview every three, four years.
[02:36:53.449 --> 02:36:56.472]  He shows up here a year ago, says, they're coming next year.
[02:36:56.472 --> 02:36:57.893]  I've been told by... and now it's here.
[02:36:57.893 --> 02:36:58.554]  Right.
[02:36:59.454 --> 02:37:05.358]  I mean, everything that we could take that Matt Drudge interview, and piece by piece, he warned us, and it's really true.
[02:37:05.358 --> 02:37:07.120]  It's not like he was just thinking this up on his own.
[02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:08.981]  It was being told by high-level people.
[02:37:08.981 --> 02:37:09.762]  Exactly.
[02:37:09.762 --> 02:37:11.383]  I've been told the same thing.
[02:37:11.383 --> 02:37:13.845]  They were planning when Hillary got in to start arresting people!
[02:37:14.764 --> 02:37:16.785]  I just think- That's why they're all pissed!
[02:37:16.785 --> 02:37:18.565]  They were about to have their way with us.
[02:37:18.565 --> 02:37:21.126]  The intelligence agencies and the patriots kicked their butt.
[02:37:21.126 --> 02:37:21.567]  Right.
[02:37:21.567 --> 02:37:23.007]  And now they're pissed!
[02:37:23.007 --> 02:37:24.428]  They did not see it coming.
[02:37:24.428 --> 02:37:26.488]  They truly thought that they- Look, let me tell you something.
[02:37:26.488 --> 02:37:29.250]  The patriots are going to release all the real dirt.
[02:37:29.250 --> 02:37:34.692]  I think that's why Trump's confident, is if they really want to push, stuff's going to get released that is going to mean.
[02:37:34.692 --> 02:37:36.412]  You're all going to jail, okay?
[02:37:36.412 --> 02:37:37.092]  Just get ready.
[02:37:37.092 --> 02:37:38.053]  You asked for it, go ahead.
[02:37:38.593 --> 02:37:47.756]  Well, the fact that they're going to want to start World War III out there, but then if they don't allow President-elect Trump to take office, it's going to start a civil war here in our own country.
[02:37:47.756 --> 02:37:49.857]  So it's just going to be madness, chaos everywhere.
[02:37:49.857 --> 02:37:50.137]  Sure.
[02:37:50.137 --> 02:37:51.598]  And it's a big pedophile guild running it.
[02:37:51.598 --> 02:37:53.158]  You don't get in unless you're a pedophile.
[02:37:53.158 --> 02:37:58.820]  That's why they focused on Pizzagate as a distraction with that one pizza place to divert off all the other emails that proved it.
[02:37:58.820 --> 02:37:59.601]  Well, just guess what?
[02:37:59.601 --> 02:38:00.501]  It's all going to come out now.
[02:38:01.158 --> 02:38:02.178]  Right.
[02:38:02.178 --> 02:38:07.560]  Alex, you mentioned them kicking out the Russian diplomats from the country.
[02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:11.742]  You know, this article that's originating from Zero Hedge, it is ridiculous!
[02:38:11.742 --> 02:38:18.764]  So at some point the White House is set to unveil a new sanction and other retaliatory measures against Russia, specifically the Kremlin.
[02:38:18.764 --> 02:38:25.166]  We're going to just continue to freeze all their assets, which is exactly what we did after Crimea and the Ukraine situation.
[02:38:25.166 --> 02:38:27.587]  And then say Trump's a Russian agent when he unfreezes it.
[02:38:27.927 --> 02:38:29.329]  Right, exactly.
[02:38:29.329 --> 02:38:31.371]  And you are as well, my dear boss.
[02:38:31.371 --> 02:38:34.475]  You are a Russian agent as well, like we all are.
[02:38:34.475 --> 02:38:36.077]  And you know what?
[02:38:36.077 --> 02:38:38.040]  These sanctions, they just go right along with it.
[02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:39.061]  Why not sanction them?
[02:38:39.061 --> 02:38:40.563]  Why not try to freeze their assets?
[02:38:40.563 --> 02:38:41.604]  Yeah, why not?
[02:38:41.604 --> 02:38:46.671]  They just signed a bill to put the FCC over all media and the CIA running it last week.
[02:38:47.071 --> 02:38:47.531]  That's right.
[02:38:47.531 --> 02:38:55.194]  And meanwhile, we've got this Spanish defense military report that is saying, look, we have a hotbed situation happening.
[02:38:55.194 --> 02:39:01.076]  Islamic radicalism, the conditions are enabling because of the way that it is here.
[02:39:01.076 --> 02:39:05.798]  They're enabling this free and almost undetectable movement of their members in the region.
[02:39:05.798 --> 02:39:10.320]  And yet, Latin America is a major recipient of USAID, I might add.
[02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:12.661]  Meanwhile, they're a hotbed for radical extremism.
[02:39:13.021 --> 02:39:13.381]  That's right.
[02:39:13.381 --> 02:39:17.283]  Go over that headline because this is important for folks to understand.
[02:39:17.283 --> 02:39:21.346]  Our government's made an alliance with jihadis worldwide to give them weapons.
[02:39:21.346 --> 02:39:22.006]  It's all come out.
[02:39:22.006 --> 02:39:23.287]  Our military knows it.
[02:39:23.287 --> 02:39:30.771]  They call it a conspiracy theory and fake news that the Arab Spring was funded by the West and turned loose when it's a fact.
[02:39:30.771 --> 02:39:32.252]  It's an admitted... It's like...
[02:39:33.012 --> 02:39:46.518]  The former, you know, spokesman for Obama saying, I was told to go out there and say there is no drone program, even though it had existed for five years, thousands of strikes, thousands of sorties, and I was saying something didn't exist that was admitted to exist.
[02:39:46.518 --> 02:39:51.801]  You know, it's like saying Donald Trump doesn't exist, or, or, or, or Leanne Mack who doesn't have brown hair.
[02:39:51.801 --> 02:39:53.942]  It's prima facie horse manure.
[02:39:53.942 --> 02:39:55.703]  What do you think the tactic here is?
[02:39:55.703 --> 02:39:57.984]  Where do you think this is all going, Ashley?
[02:39:59.023 --> 02:40:08.274]  Well, Alex, I think where it's all going is, well, basically they want to totally create this whole World War III scenario, as we've been talking about.
[02:40:08.274 --> 02:40:13.881]  I mean, they're taking measures beyond anything they've ever done with the Cold War with Russia.
[02:40:14.321 --> 02:40:20.468]  Everywhere you go, there's propaganda about Russia, you know, having hacked the election, yet we have no proof.
[02:40:20.468 --> 02:40:28.738]  There's another, you know, Zero Hedge article, Obama under intense pressure to release evidence proving Russians hacked the election.
[02:40:28.738 --> 02:40:31.982]  So we're just kind of waiting for, you know, the real proof.
[02:40:31.982 --> 02:40:32.983]  And there is none.
[02:40:32.983 --> 02:40:34.425]  And that's just the fact of the matter.
[02:40:34.645 --> 02:40:35.325]  That's right.
[02:40:50.831 --> 02:40:50.971]  I think
[02:41:07.793 --> 02:41:33.451]  No one in the reality-based universe would say I'm connected to Russia or anybody else's and so here we are battling for this Republic, battling to lower taxes, battling to take care of our veterans, battling to secure our borders, battling to stop the government-funded cop killing and all this insanity and then they're saying we need a war with Russia and are doing all the things you do before a war and then they just activated the Middle East to blow up with an intifada.
[02:41:33.451 --> 02:41:36.232]  This shows they're going for broke with 21 days.
[02:41:36.232 --> 02:41:37.093]  Let me ask all of you.
[02:41:37.813 --> 02:41:44.559]  Again, going back to Ashley, then right through Margaret and Leigh-Anne, what do you think they're going to pull next in 21 days?
[02:41:44.559 --> 02:41:46.580]  What do you think we can do?
[02:41:46.580 --> 02:41:52.765]  Well, it seems like Israel seems to be, you know, a really, really hot-button issue right now.
[02:41:52.765 --> 02:42:01.412]  They seem to really be pushing, I mean, with John Kerry yesterday saying that, you know, Israel's never going to be at peace, there's never going to be a two-state solution.
[02:42:02.012 --> 02:42:16.358]  You know, so I really think that they're going to try to use Israel and, you know, Russia, you know, some of our big allies in order to just kind of create this World War III scenario before Trump gets into office.
[02:42:16.358 --> 02:42:16.978]  I totally agree.
[02:42:16.978 --> 02:42:20.479]  Before you keep going further, I've always pointed this out.
[02:42:20.479 --> 02:42:23.541]  And like I said, Gary Johnson acts mentally ill and does this flick of the tongue thing.
[02:42:23.541 --> 02:42:26.722]  And when he was here, would like stare at the walls like he was on something.
[02:42:26.722 --> 02:42:28.863]  Then people noticed he started doing it in public.
[02:42:29.975 --> 02:42:37.517]  Kerry looks like he's wearing a rubber mask and constantly, like a snake, flicks his tongue out like he's got, you know, Down Syndrome or something.
[02:42:37.517 --> 02:42:39.018]  I'm not trying to be mean here.
[02:42:39.018 --> 02:42:40.458]  What has happened to these people?
[02:42:40.458 --> 02:42:43.039]  It's like they're possessed by something.
[02:42:43.039 --> 02:42:45.880]  What do you make of this, Ashley, and then others?
[02:42:46.966 --> 02:42:48.046]  Uh, well, definitely.
[02:42:48.046 --> 02:42:50.927]  It looks like it could be some sort of mental illness.
[02:42:50.927 --> 02:42:54.068]  I mean, there are so many different things that could be affecting these people.
[02:42:54.068 --> 02:42:58.549]  We don't know, you know, what they could have been undergoing, you know, these new technologies and things.
[02:42:58.549 --> 02:43:00.710]  We have no idea, you know, what is actually affecting them.
[02:43:00.710 --> 02:43:06.111]  I was about to say, he didn't look like this until about two years ago, and then he just emerged with this rubber head and the tongue flicking.
[02:43:06.991 --> 02:43:09.072]  It's a really, really, really weird tick.
[02:43:09.072 --> 02:43:11.914]  I'm telling you, Gary Johnson didn't act like a human when he was here.
[02:43:11.914 --> 02:43:13.695]  He's been here before, it was totally normal.
[02:43:13.695 --> 02:43:14.835]  What do you think it is, Maggie?
[02:43:14.835 --> 02:43:17.716]  You know, it's a demonic possession, if I had to guess.
[02:43:17.716 --> 02:43:18.957]  That's my expert opinion.
[02:43:18.957 --> 02:43:22.879]  And we've got him saying, you know what, Israel, you can't both be Jewish and Democratic.
[02:43:22.879 --> 02:43:26.201]  Well, screw Democratic, number one, especially your version of it, buddy.
[02:43:26.201 --> 02:43:28.442]  Plus, I'm saying the U.S.
[02:43:28.442 --> 02:43:30.002]  can't be based on Christianity.
[02:43:30.002 --> 02:43:33.144]  It doesn't mean it's a state-run religion, but Christians were in the founding.
[02:43:33.573 --> 02:43:34.413]  Right, exactly.
[02:43:34.413 --> 02:43:36.454]  Meanwhile, we've got these nation-states working together.
[02:43:36.454 --> 02:43:40.775]  Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Russia, Vladimir Putin discussing a ceasefire.
[02:43:40.775 --> 02:43:48.196]  They conveniently leave our president out of it because he props up imams of Iran and goes after Israel.
[02:43:48.196 --> 02:43:56.698]  So, to your question, what could we see in the next 20-some odd days, you know what, we can't take, as Roger Stone has said time and again, an assassination attempt off the table.
[02:43:56.698 --> 02:44:00.639]  We have mainstream media elites practically calling for it.
[02:44:00.639 --> 02:44:02.219]  There's no telling, but it looks like...
[02:44:02.639 --> 02:44:05.160]  It's clear they're trying to start a war ahead of Trump getting in.
[02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:13.342]  And then say, we're Russian agents, we're at war with Russia, and basically just have helicopters attack Trump Tower, kill Trump, wipe him out, wipe out the generals.
[02:44:13.342 --> 02:44:14.703]  That's why Trump's got generals around him.
[02:44:14.703 --> 02:44:15.663]  Trump knows what's going on.
[02:44:15.663 --> 02:44:20.345]  You heard Stone earlier, I haven't talked to Trump in a while, but I mean, this is just out of control.
[02:44:20.345 --> 02:44:22.926]  But I've told Trump, I said, they're coming after you, and he goes, yeah.
[02:44:24.605 --> 02:44:29.050]  Well, and that's why I don't think that he, you know, he finally came to understand that, like, they're not going to hold back.
[02:44:29.050 --> 02:44:31.993]  So he just really came after him, said whatever.
[02:44:31.993 --> 02:44:36.618]  You know, they weren't expecting him to go hard in the debate against Bill Clinton and everything.
[02:44:36.618 --> 02:44:40.302]  But we're seeing just this massive gaslighting against the masses.
[02:44:40.302 --> 02:44:42.965]  And this is their social... Folks, I don't know what gaslighting is.
[02:44:42.965 --> 02:44:44.186]  It's an inversion of reality.
[02:44:44.186 --> 02:44:44.407]  Explain.
[02:44:44.867 --> 02:44:51.011]  Right, it's basically, you know, someone tricking you by flickering the lights, and then you're saying, man, why are the lights flickering?
[02:44:51.011 --> 02:44:52.372]  And they're saying, the lights?
[02:44:52.372 --> 02:44:53.673]  I don't see the lights flickering.
[02:44:53.673 --> 02:44:54.333]  You must be kidding me.
[02:44:54.333 --> 02:44:57.195]  I just got this IRS letter, $5,000 fine.
[02:44:57.195 --> 02:44:58.376]  You didn't get that.
[02:44:58.376 --> 02:44:59.477]  You're like, yeah, here's the fine.
[02:44:59.477 --> 02:45:00.237]  And no, you didn't.
[02:45:00.237 --> 02:45:00.637]  Racist.
[02:45:00.637 --> 02:45:03.940]  Or saying, you know, Trump is going to start World War III.
[02:45:03.940 --> 02:45:06.241]  But meanwhile, they're starting World War III.
[02:45:06.241 --> 02:45:10.724]  Or President Obama coming out and saying, everyone should be alarmed about the Russians.
[02:45:10.724 --> 02:45:11.265]  And we're saying, why?
[02:45:12.265 --> 02:45:15.388]  There's been a coup against this country by multinationals.
[02:45:15.388 --> 02:45:19.151]  We're trying to get back control like Russia did 18 years ago of their own country.
[02:45:19.151 --> 02:45:20.312]  Doesn't mean they're perfect.
[02:45:20.312 --> 02:45:23.815]  And of course we're all in solidarity, whether it's Italy or the UK or whatever.
[02:45:23.815 --> 02:45:25.817]  We don't want to be under the globalists.
[02:45:25.817 --> 02:45:30.241]  And so they're pissed trying to cause a war to make us stay under their UN.
[02:45:30.241 --> 02:45:30.541]  Right.
[02:45:30.541 --> 02:45:32.843]  And that's what I think is just so incredible.
[02:45:32.843 --> 02:45:33.784]  Yes, it's crazy.
[02:45:33.784 --> 02:45:35.125]  It's a volatile time.
[02:45:35.125 --> 02:45:39.408]  But it's also really incredible because the beast is on the verge of collapse.
[02:45:40.149 --> 02:45:41.990]  And that's why they are really ramping up.
[02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:42.270]  I agree.
[02:45:42.270 --> 02:45:45.491]  Let's get some hydrogen bomb explosions going behind us here for TV viewers.
[02:45:45.491 --> 02:45:49.673]  I mean, folks, it's a miracle we haven't had a nuclear war yet.
[02:45:49.673 --> 02:45:59.457]  And I was just talking to folks yesterday, you know, they've got one squadron of airplanes in this country that in just a few hours could fly from end of end of the country, bombing every city and killing 150 million people.
[02:46:00.797 --> 02:46:01.317]  Okay?
[02:46:01.317 --> 02:46:06.541]  I mean, that's what we've got going with crazy people like Kerry with his tongue flipping out.
[02:46:06.541 --> 02:46:09.303]  And I realize it's like Stockholm Syndrome to Islam.
[02:46:09.303 --> 02:46:11.464]  The Saudis have bought all these guys off.
[02:46:11.464 --> 02:46:13.466]  They want some giant global jihad.
[02:46:13.466 --> 02:46:19.610]  And the left hates Christianity and prosperity so much and is so into authoritarianism, they're in love with Islam!
[02:46:20.250 --> 02:46:30.836]  Well, what do you make of the fact that you have John Kerry coming out telling Israel they need to either choose Jewish or a democratic state, but they would never say that to Saudi Arabia, who is beheading women.
[02:46:30.836 --> 02:46:35.718]  Oh yeah, women just got beheaded yesterday for shopping without their husband.
[02:46:35.718 --> 02:46:36.779]  That's in my stat.
[02:46:37.495 --> 02:46:46.664]  It's like, we've seen the way that they treat governments who allow, who are democratic and who allow Christians, Muslims, you know, Hindus or whatever to live.
[02:46:46.664 --> 02:46:51.608]  They took out... Yeah, the point is if I go to Saudi Arabia and say, praise Jesus on the street, they're going to put me in jail.
[02:46:51.608 --> 02:46:51.969]  Right.
[02:46:51.969 --> 02:46:53.670]  Next time they're going to execute me.
[02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:56.473]  Now there it is, woman beheaded in Afghanistan for shopping without a husband.
[02:46:56.713 --> 02:46:57.473]  Mm-hmm.
[02:46:57.473 --> 02:47:01.956]  And now they're calling for another woman to be beheaded because she dared to go out without her headscarf.
[02:47:01.956 --> 02:47:03.356]  You know, in Saudi Arabia.
[02:47:03.356 --> 02:47:05.137]  This is a bunch of insecure perverts.
[02:47:05.137 --> 02:47:07.558]  I mean, again, cutting women's genitals off.
[02:47:07.558 --> 02:47:09.599]  What a bunch of uncool people, man.
[02:47:09.599 --> 02:47:10.360]  I mean, look at this.
[02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:11.520]  Spanish military report.
[02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:15.742]  Islamic terrorists operate, raise cash in Latin America to attack U.S.
[02:47:15.742 --> 02:47:16.423]  Judicial Watch.
[02:47:16.943 --> 02:47:18.044]  Here's another one.
[02:47:18.044 --> 02:47:22.826]  ISIS-linked group calls for New Year's Eve attacks using horrific images.
[02:47:22.826 --> 02:47:25.007]  If they attack, they'll say it wasn't Islamic.
[02:47:25.007 --> 02:47:28.848]  France raises terror attacks to support victims of attacks.
[02:47:28.848 --> 02:47:29.649]  Religion of Peace.
[02:47:29.649 --> 02:47:31.710]  Women beheaded after shopping without husband.
[02:47:31.710 --> 02:47:32.590]  Jihad in Belgium.
[02:47:32.590 --> 02:47:35.191]  Police arrest 14-year-old with backpack bombs.
[02:47:35.191 --> 02:47:36.192]  Economic Jihad.
[02:47:36.192 --> 02:47:39.333]  ISIS fighters receive welfare benefits from Danish taxpayers.
[02:47:39.333 --> 02:47:40.194]  They're flying them back.
[02:47:41.394 --> 02:47:42.035]  Welfare.
[02:47:42.035 --> 02:47:42.975]  Because they love it.
[02:47:42.975 --> 02:47:45.858]  I mean, there's nothing a liberal woman loves like a jihadi.
[02:47:45.858 --> 02:47:46.338]  It's cuckolding.
[02:47:46.338 --> 02:47:47.880]  They want to be chained up.
[02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:48.640]  Security fears.
[02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:49.301]  Well, we don't.
[02:47:49.301 --> 02:47:50.762]  So you go there and be a slave.
[02:47:50.762 --> 02:47:51.703]  We don't want it.
[02:47:51.703 --> 02:47:59.109]  Security fears prompt police to ban far-rights New Year's Eve protests in Cologne to mark 12 months since wave of sex attacks in the city.
[02:47:59.109 --> 02:48:04.334]  So the right-wingers can't go out and protest Islam, but Islam can run around and act like a bunch of morons.
[02:48:04.334 --> 02:48:04.974]  Fire sale.
[02:48:04.974 --> 02:48:06.456]  Hillary book now at 86% discount.
[02:48:08.413 --> 02:48:12.637]  Again, the elite are, here's the good news, they're so arrogant they thought we wanted this space alien.
[02:48:12.637 --> 02:48:13.959]  Ladies, go ahead and comment.
[02:48:13.959 --> 02:48:18.503]  Well, so that's the thing, is just going back to this whole gaslighting.
[02:48:18.503 --> 02:48:24.069]  We, because we are tapped into our humanity, look at these stories and say, my God, what is happening?
[02:48:24.069 --> 02:48:25.571]  This is absolute madness.
[02:48:25.571 --> 02:48:29.755]  Meanwhile, you have people like George Soros saying, this is the new normal.
[02:48:29.755 --> 02:48:30.916]  This is loving it.
[02:48:30.916 --> 02:48:31.677]  Trump is Hitler.
[02:48:31.917 --> 02:48:33.378]  It's great.
[02:48:33.378 --> 02:48:40.542]  You're going to get terror attacks and it's fine because you've got to open your heart and this is the new world order, immigration.
[02:48:40.542 --> 02:48:46.326]  And the left today are just weak-minded people that submit to whatever they're told via peer pressure who've been bullied.
[02:48:46.326 --> 02:48:48.907]  And they've got the same right-wing establishment that hates Trump too.
[02:48:48.907 --> 02:48:55.071]  Everybody you claim you hate is against Trump, but you want to kill him because your identity is being a dumbass.
[02:48:55.071 --> 02:48:59.934]  Excuse me, I know I've been using some wide profanity, I apologize, but we're on the edge of nuclear war here, people.
[02:49:00.154 --> 02:49:01.835]  Right, this is not a time to be civil.
[02:49:01.835 --> 02:49:06.796]  This is a time for people to wake up and realize that they are being played on a massive scale.
[02:49:06.796 --> 02:49:11.837]  Yeah, I'm gonna wear my Trump shirt everywhere, Trump's my president, and anybody gets in my face, I'm done.
[02:49:11.837 --> 02:49:19.560]  I'm done with pseudo-intellectual jackasses on their holier-than-thou power trip telling me how I want war and how I'm racist.
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:20.260]  You guys jump in.
[02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:21.940]  Well, it's hard to see it.
[02:49:21.940 --> 02:49:33.324]  I think here in Austin, like you were saying, there's so many people on power trips here that really did want Bernie Sanders and, you know, they're in favor of socialism, communism, whatever you want to call it.
[02:49:33.324 --> 02:49:35.464]  But the bottom line is this.
[02:49:35.464 --> 02:49:38.565]  I really am happy for American women.
[02:49:38.565 --> 02:49:42.147]  I'm proud of them that they didn't actually fall for the line.
[02:49:42.147 --> 02:49:43.747]  They didn't fall for Hillary Clinton.
[02:49:43.747 --> 02:49:45.207]  Record numbers voted for Trump.
[02:49:45.207 --> 02:49:45.728]  You're right.
[02:49:45.728 --> 02:49:46.868]  And they don't like that number, do they?
[02:49:47.208 --> 02:49:52.373]  Yeah, and even, you know, 8% of African Americans voted for, you know, Trump.
[02:49:52.373 --> 02:49:56.376]  So, that was a positive, you know, we're seeing the tide change.
[02:49:56.376 --> 02:49:57.377]  It's probably higher than that, too.
[02:49:57.377 --> 02:49:58.758]  It was massive election fraud.
[02:49:58.758 --> 02:49:59.079]  Right.
[02:49:59.079 --> 02:50:00.680]  Okay, yeah, exactly, right.
[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:01.941]  So, yeah.
[02:50:01.941 --> 02:50:06.946]  He has a homosexual, a woman, and a black man all in his cabinet.
[02:50:07.686 --> 02:50:14.231]  They were so unsuccessful at the lies he was sparing, but Soros has the audacity to call him a con artist and a dictator.
[02:50:14.231 --> 02:50:16.533]  My one question, does this man ever die?
[02:50:16.533 --> 02:50:18.014]  Is he ever going to die?
[02:50:18.014 --> 02:50:20.716]  It's like, literally, he looks like he's... That's a good question, Ashley.
[02:50:20.716 --> 02:50:22.077]  Where do we deport George Soros?
[02:50:23.497 --> 02:50:24.497]  I don't know.
[02:50:24.497 --> 02:50:25.818]  Hopefully soon.
[02:50:25.818 --> 02:50:30.299]  He just creates so many different, you know, movements of divisiveness.
[02:50:30.299 --> 02:50:39.321]  I mean, from Black Lives Matter to, you know, whatever it is, just to be able to bring people down and basically just control every aspect of their lives.
[02:50:39.321 --> 02:50:41.101]  That's what he wants to do with his money and his influence.
[02:50:41.101 --> 02:50:41.381]  Good point.
[02:50:41.381 --> 02:50:44.702]  I want to come back and get more from Margaret, Leigh-Anne, all of you straight ahead.
[02:50:44.702 --> 02:50:45.282]  And then we've got
[02:50:46.123 --> 02:50:51.670]  The man that started over a decade ago NoMoreFakeNews.com, he's going to be hosting Mr. Rappaport.
[02:50:51.670 --> 02:50:52.031]  Wow!
[02:50:52.031 --> 02:50:53.313]  What an incredible time to be alive!
[02:50:53.313 --> 02:50:59.021]  Infowars.com, while we're still up, is battling as hard as we can on stations across the country, defending the Republic.
[02:51:04.528 --> 02:51:06.188]  Good day, America.
[02:51:06.188 --> 02:51:09.209]  Are you tired of your butt cheeks being frozen?
[02:51:09.209 --> 02:51:11.610]  Tired of cold hands or cold feet?
[02:51:11.610 --> 02:51:13.130]  I'm tired of the cold.
[02:51:13.130 --> 02:51:15.150]  Well, there's a new kid on the block.
[02:51:15.150 --> 02:51:16.851]  It's Fortress Clothing.
[02:51:16.851 --> 02:51:18.971]  Fortress will keep you warm.

[02:52:03.875 --> 02:52:06.616]  I absolutely love One World Whey.
[02:52:06.616 --> 02:52:11.678]  It was about five years ago when a trainer told me it was the end all of protein powders.
[02:52:11.678 --> 02:52:15.020]  One day when I ran out, I decided to try other brands.
[02:52:15.020 --> 02:52:18.001]  I spent eight months and could not find a replacement.
[02:52:18.001 --> 02:52:21.202]  I went through tons of brands, types, and flavors, and almost all
[02:52:21.522 --> 02:52:24.483]  All of them tasted unnatural and not pleasant.
[02:52:24.483 --> 02:52:28.664]  When it all boiled down, I came right back to One World Whey.
[02:52:28.664 --> 02:52:34.226]  I buy the cost-effective five-pound container and my family craves their One World Whey, too.
[02:52:34.226 --> 02:52:39.568]  I look forward to and enjoy having my One World Whey and feel great after I drink it.

[02:54:35.659 --> 02:54:37.640]  Obviously, I'm going to be cutting special reports.
[02:54:37.640 --> 02:54:40.461]  The nightly news tonight premieres at 7 o'clock central.

[02:54:45.364 --> 02:54:47.865]  I want to go to Ferris in New Hampshire.
[02:54:47.865 --> 02:54:49.366]  Ferris, you're on the air with our reporters.
[02:54:49.366 --> 02:54:52.767]  Go ahead.
[02:54:52.767 --> 02:54:53.608]  Good day, Alex.
[02:54:53.608 --> 02:54:54.928]  You're a dangerous man.
[02:54:54.928 --> 02:54:55.869]  You've got us thinking.
[02:54:57.608 --> 02:54:59.009]  Believe me, I've done my duty.
[02:54:59.009 --> 02:55:00.350]  I didn't know we'd be this successful.
[02:55:00.350 --> 02:55:07.895]  I kind of get sick of being the biggest fish in a big old gigantic pond with a bunch of sharks, but keep praying for us.
[02:55:07.895 --> 02:55:11.838]  Well, we love you deeply, but a couple quick credentials on myself.
[02:55:11.838 --> 02:55:15.180]  Military intelligence officer.
[02:55:15.180 --> 02:55:17.362]  Highly educated.
[02:55:17.362 --> 02:55:21.245]  Highly intelligent.
[02:55:21.245 --> 02:55:25.668]  Happen to be in the right place at the right time on talk radio, and this is another day like that.
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:33.204]  I'm also the most widely and often heard caller, broadcaster, and talk radio.
[02:55:33.204 --> 02:55:54.296]  And as I sit here and listen to the developments of today, and you talk about a couple generals and the positions that they find themselves in, thanks to Trump, let us not forget the least mentioned general who is the biggest man among us, and that is General Joseph Dunford.
[02:55:54.296 --> 02:55:55.557]  Excuse me, General Joseph
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:56:08.771]  Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a college brother of mine, who I think is going to be our salvation as he has been
[02:56:09.711 --> 02:56:13.294]  Up until this time, as reported by Dr. Steve Pysenek.
[02:56:13.294 --> 02:56:20.620]  And by the way, I want to be very, very clear for the folks that don't know, it has been the military that has held back Obama and backing ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[02:56:20.620 --> 02:56:24.904]  That's who blocked them, that's who released the WikiLeaks, and that's why they're so angry.
[02:56:24.904 --> 02:56:35.773]  So, the good news is that's, you know, I hope the military stops Obama, because they're trying to figure out how to get this going, and you're absolutely right.
[02:56:35.773 --> 02:56:38.435]  Well, we have reason to think that they already have.
[02:56:39.742 --> 02:56:49.026]  And we'll continue to, as long as we continue to identify the strengths that we have among a couple groups of men.
[02:56:49.026 --> 02:56:50.847]  Sure, let me ask you this.
[02:56:50.847 --> 02:56:52.988]  Do you concur with our analysis of this?
[02:56:52.988 --> 02:56:58.991]  And A, and then B, do you think they can get away with launching a larger war?
[02:56:58.991 --> 02:57:00.632]  Yes, and certainly.
[02:57:00.632 --> 02:57:05.494]  And it depends upon how stout-hearted these men are.
[02:57:06.314 --> 02:57:10.039]  See, we have a couple groups of men that we owe our existence to.
[02:57:10.039 --> 02:57:12.141]  One is called the Founding Fathers.
[02:57:12.141 --> 02:57:19.750]  The ladies who run our government want us to refer to them as the Founders, because they are missing from the phrase Founding Fathers.
[02:57:22.777 --> 02:57:26.380]  With women in that room at the time, you never would have had this republic.
[02:57:26.380 --> 02:57:27.661]  Can we agree on that?
[02:57:27.661 --> 02:57:29.923]  If there was any estrogen in that room?
[02:57:29.923 --> 02:57:34.727]  Well, I think we got three ladies right here, but the point is, it just becomes a distraction, I think, a diversion.
[02:57:34.727 --> 02:57:39.031]  The point is, is that, is that this planet, women have been having the children, men have been doing the fighting.
[02:57:39.031 --> 02:57:41.453]  That's what we do, but go ahead.
[02:57:41.453 --> 02:57:45.256]  Well, now's a renewal of that, and I don't care that you got three ladies there.
[02:57:45.256 --> 02:57:46.036]  That's your problem.
[02:57:46.036 --> 02:57:46.817]  No, no, I hear you.
[02:57:46.817 --> 02:57:47.778]  So what do you think's going on?
[02:57:49.659 --> 02:57:59.172]  What I think is going on is this republic hangs in the balance and it's going to require the re-emergence of the alpha male.
[02:58:00.619 --> 02:58:11.664]  To say that, you see, with all deference to the ladies, and I'm like Trump, we... No, I hear you, but look, it's evil men like Soros that are our issue.
[02:58:11.664 --> 02:58:18.246]  I think to sit there and say that... Advertisers and propaganda targets women because then they can get the men to do what they want.
[02:58:18.246 --> 02:58:20.267]  But I don't think the issue is an issue of women.
[02:58:20.267 --> 02:58:21.708]  I think it's an issue of men and women.
[02:58:21.708 --> 02:58:22.868]  But I hear what you're saying.
[02:58:22.868 --> 02:58:23.708]  We're in an epic time.
[02:58:23.708 --> 02:58:24.589]  Ferris, I gotta jump.
[02:58:24.589 --> 02:58:25.689]  Call us back another time.
[02:58:25.689 --> 02:58:28.230]  When we come back, a few more phone calls to get these ladies' comment.
[02:58:28.230 --> 02:58:29.931]  I don't know if I can allow you to talk, though.
[02:58:30.171 --> 02:58:32.713]  I know.
[02:58:32.713 --> 02:58:34.314]  Hey, seriously, it was a funny call.
[02:58:34.314 --> 02:58:35.775]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:35.775 --> 02:58:38.237]  This is the InfoWar, hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:58:50.811 --> 02:58:57.537]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.

[02:59:47.303 --> 02:59:53.305]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[02:59:53.305 --> 02:59:55.966]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:04.207 --> 03:00:10.936]  Alright, into hour number four!
[03:00:10.936 --> 03:00:13.620]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:13.620 --> 03:00:18.747]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:20.689 --> 03:00:23.050]  I get what the caller was saying.
[03:00:23.050 --> 03:00:26.171]  It's called feminization, but that's not really even how women act.
[03:00:26.171 --> 03:00:31.353]  Turning men into subservient people, I think the wrong word is feminization, for the whole metrosexual thing.
[03:00:31.353 --> 03:00:35.634]  But Leigh-Anne, you were agreeing with some of what the caller said, but also, you know, countering it.
[03:00:35.634 --> 03:00:37.154]  This is the dehumanization.
[03:00:37.154 --> 03:00:40.355]  They're targeting all of our normal traits, turning us against each other.
[03:00:40.355 --> 03:00:41.076]  Right.
[03:00:41.076 --> 03:00:41.696]  Permission to speak?
[03:00:42.156 --> 03:00:43.177]  Yes, you have permission.
[03:00:43.177 --> 03:00:46.880]  They'll probably cut that out if they actually did that, so go ahead.
[03:00:46.880 --> 03:00:49.662]  Look, Jones mentions female people.
[03:00:49.662 --> 03:00:50.222]  You get permission.
[03:00:50.222 --> 03:00:51.483]  Go ahead.
[03:00:51.483 --> 03:01:07.276]  Well, you know, to kind of back Ferris up a little bit there, I mean, obviously, yes, we have seen a lot of these feminazis come out and really dehumanize men and really push this emasculation and, you know, women really only want men who are subservient.
[03:01:07.276 --> 03:01:08.297]  Emasculation's the right word.
[03:01:09.079 --> 03:01:20.302]  Yeah, you know and so I understand that to a certain degree is like putting these certain women in power that demand that their men grovel at their feet.
[03:01:20.302 --> 03:01:25.704]  So that I understand because we do have a bunch of chicken neck Nellies running around telling everyone what to do.
[03:01:25.704 --> 03:01:27.765]  They're not real men.
[03:01:27.765 --> 03:01:35.247]  But you know at the same time as I sit with these three women on the panel, I also think that other women out there as well as men appreciate that they can
[03:01:35.507 --> 03:01:39.831]  Sure, and right-wing men responding like it's women doing this to them.
[03:01:39.831 --> 03:01:41.773]  It's social engineering against all of us.
[03:01:41.773 --> 03:01:48.419]  Right, it was like a long time ago, the social engineering that forced women into the workforce, breaking up the family.
[03:01:48.419 --> 03:01:52.102]  We've all been socially engineered, so let's not fight amongst each other even more.
[03:01:52.102 --> 03:01:53.683]  I agree.
[03:01:53.683 --> 03:01:55.044]  Ashley, Margaret, you want to comment on this?
[03:01:55.044 --> 03:01:56.005]  I've got some ladies holding.
[03:01:56.005 --> 03:01:57.807]  I'm going to have to hold them over as we actually get to them.
[03:01:57.807 --> 03:01:59.869]  You know, Ruth and Debbie, so they can speak.
[03:01:59.869 --> 03:02:01.910]  These evil women are calling in to fight the new order.
[03:02:01.910 --> 03:02:02.351]  How horrible.
[03:02:02.711 --> 03:02:03.412]  Shut them up.
[03:02:03.412 --> 03:02:04.012]  Go ahead.
[03:02:04.012 --> 03:02:04.913]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:02:04.913 --> 03:02:10.218]  I was just going to say I do agree, you know, with what some of the things that the caller was saying.
[03:02:10.218 --> 03:02:12.781]  But the bottom line is this.
[03:02:12.781 --> 03:02:16.945]  Basically, you have a situation where, yeah, it's a lot of emasculation.
[03:02:16.945 --> 03:02:19.507]  We do have a return to the alpha male.
[03:02:19.507 --> 03:02:23.651]  I think that was shown with Trump actually winning the presidency.
[03:02:23.651 --> 03:02:25.433]  So, I mean, I agree with him on that.
[03:02:25.433 --> 03:02:26.474]  But the alpha male better deliver.
[03:02:27.114 --> 03:02:27.334]  Right.
[03:02:27.334 --> 03:02:28.375]  Exactly, right.
[03:02:28.375 --> 03:02:30.036]  He better deliver, exactly.
[03:02:30.036 --> 03:02:33.037]  And the bottom line is, you know, we have to stay together.
[03:02:33.037 --> 03:02:37.720]  Like you said, it's a divisiveness when they're trying to pit women and men against each other.
[03:02:37.720 --> 03:02:38.580]  That's not what we need.
[03:02:38.580 --> 03:02:41.822]  Sure, and they're the ones doing it, and the right wing falls into that too much doing it.
[03:02:41.822 --> 03:02:42.022]  Right.
[03:02:42.022 --> 03:02:42.462]  Exactly.
[03:02:42.462 --> 03:02:46.384]  We need women to be women, in my opinion, and men to be men.
[03:02:46.384 --> 03:02:49.846]  And when you bring that back, then, you know, things will get better.
[03:02:49.846 --> 03:02:50.386]  Absolutely.
[03:02:50.386 --> 03:02:50.807]  Great point.
[03:02:52.984 --> 03:02:54.225]  Margaret?
[03:02:54.225 --> 03:02:56.126]  I love you Leanne and Ashley.
[03:02:56.126 --> 03:02:57.627]  I'm not backing up Ferris.
[03:02:57.627 --> 03:03:00.629]  I personally like having ladies on here and the points you bring up.
[03:03:00.629 --> 03:03:01.249]  I love it.
[03:03:01.249 --> 03:03:02.270]  I want more women.
[03:03:02.270 --> 03:03:03.010]  More women.
[03:03:03.010 --> 03:03:04.011]  I like women.
[03:03:04.011 --> 03:03:05.091]  Ferris says that's your problem.
[03:03:05.091 --> 03:03:05.912]  I think women are great.
[03:03:07.697 --> 03:03:10.040]  You know, it is a pleasure working.
[03:03:10.040 --> 03:03:12.023]  We work around a lot of men, don't we?
[03:03:12.023 --> 03:03:17.050]  And you know, it's a pleasure having a couple of women to sort of balance out just a little.
[03:03:17.050 --> 03:03:20.735]  I'm not backing up Ferris, actually.
[03:03:20.735 --> 03:03:22.377]  But see, we're talking about men and women.
[03:03:22.377 --> 03:03:24.140]  We're all going to die in a nuclear war if this happens.
[03:03:24.620 --> 03:03:25.000]  That's right.
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:26.421]  We better get our heads screwed on straight here.
[03:03:26.421 --> 03:03:29.402]  Yeah, and like, I'm, you know, kind of a traditional female.
[03:03:29.402 --> 03:03:34.644]  I like the man to be in charge, but I don't want some alpha male that's just beating his chest and doesn't know how to communicate.
[03:03:34.644 --> 03:03:36.665]  Plus, he doesn't have a job that tells you what to do.
[03:03:36.665 --> 03:03:39.346]  Like, if a guy is going to be somewhat in charge, he better be bringing it.
[03:03:39.346 --> 03:03:40.006]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:03:40.006 --> 03:03:46.689]  And I think, I think now we've evolved to a certain place where, you know, you want your alpha male to respect you because you're an alpha female.
[03:03:46.689 --> 03:03:50.871]  Like, he wants, but I'm... Well, any real alpha male just respects their female.
[03:03:50.871 --> 03:03:51.291]  Right.
[03:03:51.291 --> 03:03:53.712]  That's, I mean, that's what I... And the female respects their male.
[03:03:54.501 --> 03:03:56.548]  And I do say that possessively because they possess each other.
[03:03:56.837 --> 03:03:59.139]  We're gonna write a book and it'll be coming out soon.
[03:04:27.017 --> 03:04:27.718]  Mm-hmm.
[03:04:27.718 --> 03:04:28.238]  Right.
[03:04:28.238 --> 03:04:29.400]  I mean, it's just common sense.
[03:04:29.400 --> 03:04:36.246]  But I see, I think that's why, you know, you are an alpha male and you don't have a problem with the ladies, which is why you don't hate on women.
[03:04:36.246 --> 03:04:39.289]  I think a lot of men that hate on women have not had success with women.
[03:04:39.289 --> 03:04:39.990]  Exactly.
[03:04:39.990 --> 03:04:42.973]  The more success you have with women, the more you want to be around women.
[03:04:42.973 --> 03:04:44.395]  It's a telltale sign.
[03:04:44.395 --> 03:04:47.357]  It's a telltale sign.
[03:04:47.357 --> 03:04:48.338]  I love my mommy.
[03:04:50.288 --> 03:04:52.330]  I don't have mommy issues.
[03:04:52.330 --> 03:04:53.171]  Yeah, okay.
[03:04:53.171 --> 03:04:53.491]  I don't.
[03:04:53.491 --> 03:04:54.232]  I had a great day.
[03:04:54.232 --> 03:04:55.573]  Great dad, great mom.
[03:04:55.573 --> 03:04:57.455]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[03:04:57.455 --> 03:04:57.856]  Stay with us.
[03:05:00.760 --> 03:05:11.988]  Would it surprise you to know that ISIS and Hezbollah are operating freely in Latin America, and these Islamic terrorists, they can raise money, and they're all planning to attack the United States while in Latin America.
[03:05:11.988 --> 03:05:15.511]  Now, this part of the world has become a hotbed for Islamic terrorism.
[03:05:15.511 --> 03:05:17.352]  Groups like ISIS operate freely.
[03:05:17.352 --> 03:05:21.015]  They're able to raise large sums of money to finance activities in other countries.
[03:05:21.035 --> 03:05:21.115]  It's
[03:05:40.828 --> 03:05:55.660]  This report specifically highlights the fact that ISIS and Hezbollah, they can operate freely in Spain, raise money, and their government in the region is considering ISIS to be a foreign problem, this report is saying, and intelligence agencies are ill-equipped to handle the threat that they represent.
[03:05:55.660 --> 03:05:58.343]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:06:00.580 --> 03:06:08.502]  All across the Western world, MSM is attempting to demonize the language and words we use, saying, don't say Merry Christmas, use holidays.
[03:06:08.502 --> 03:06:10.042]  And now they say don't use holiday.
[03:06:10.042 --> 03:06:11.502]  Well, I got some news for them.

[03:07:57.736 --> 03:08:06.383]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:24.773 --> 03:08:28.156]  Hotel Motel makes you want to cry.
[03:08:28.156 --> 03:08:34.681]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[03:08:34.681 --> 03:08:40.987]  Go into a show.
[03:08:40.987 --> 03:08:45.050]  Play and rock and roll.
[03:08:45.050 --> 03:08:47.452]  Good part right here.
[03:08:47.452 --> 03:08:50.895]  Get it took.
[03:08:50.895 --> 03:08:51.676]  Broken bones.
[03:08:55.421 --> 03:08:59.684]  I'm here to tell ya.
[03:08:59.684 --> 03:09:05.368]  No, I mean I like this song because Dave Mustaine comes and visits me, we play it and drive around in the car, but seriously, I'm not named driving.
[03:09:05.368 --> 03:09:07.530]  That's a true story.
[03:09:07.530 --> 03:09:08.650]  Don't talk, woman!
[03:09:08.650 --> 03:09:10.672]  I'm talking!
[03:09:10.672 --> 03:09:11.432]  That's a joke!
[03:09:11.432 --> 03:09:12.873]  See, the media will probably take that out and play it.
[03:09:12.873 --> 03:09:13.494]  Sorry, Leanne, go ahead.
[03:09:14.164 --> 03:09:21.392]  I was just saying, we need to get some B-roll of you raging in the car playing these songs, because people need to, this is really you, you really are a 16 year old.
[03:09:21.392 --> 03:09:22.313]  I really am obnoxious.
[03:09:22.313 --> 03:09:22.914]  I'm a male.
[03:09:22.914 --> 03:09:24.276]  That loves his mommy.
[03:09:24.276 --> 03:09:26.699]  But let's get back to this.
[03:09:26.699 --> 03:09:32.525]  All the stuff we've gone through to get Infowars to this point, it was horrible, it was terrible, a lot of it, but it's really sweet now.
[03:09:33.382 --> 03:09:35.964]  And I love the fact that Vice is doing a big hit piece on us.
[03:09:35.964 --> 03:09:37.305]  And I just love it.
[03:09:37.305 --> 03:09:41.568]  They're all blowing themselves up, discrediting themselves, calling us Russian agents.
[03:09:41.568 --> 03:09:44.750]  And all we're here doing is trying to make America great again.
[03:09:44.750 --> 03:09:51.895]  No, it's amazing how you are somehow able to take all of the attacks that they've been firing at you.
[03:09:51.895 --> 03:09:52.696]  Well, you're doing it too.
[03:09:52.696 --> 03:09:54.077]  You absorb them in.
[03:09:54.077 --> 03:09:54.637]  You're doing it too.
[03:09:54.637 --> 03:09:57.499]  The whole operation just becomes so much more powerful.
[03:09:57.499 --> 03:09:58.580]  It's incredible to watch.
[03:09:58.700 --> 03:10:00.361]  Well, that's because they're in the wrong lane.
[03:10:00.361 --> 03:10:00.621]  Right.
[03:10:00.621 --> 03:10:02.642]  Everybody had this Bengali mind control.
[03:10:02.642 --> 03:10:06.964]  When they call you a name or something, you're supposed to quit and get depressed and go get in the ditch and die.
[03:10:06.964 --> 03:10:10.866]  When a bunch of murdering, lying scum make stuff up about us, good!
[03:10:10.866 --> 03:10:14.708]  The only problem is they now have run out of everything they've got, calling us racist.
[03:10:14.708 --> 03:10:15.909]  Now it's nuclear war.
[03:10:16.409 --> 03:10:19.231]  And he's going to ride shotgun on us in this segment, and we're going to punch out.
[03:10:19.231 --> 03:10:21.053]  I want to take a few final calls.
[03:10:21.053 --> 03:10:23.114]  Mr. Rappaport is here.
[03:10:23.114 --> 03:10:24.255]  You should read his bio.
[03:10:24.255 --> 03:10:25.256]  It's up on his news site.
[03:10:25.256 --> 03:10:26.777]  It's been around for a long time.
[03:10:26.777 --> 03:10:28.598]  NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[03:10:28.598 --> 03:10:34.362]  John Rappaport, investigative journalist, worked for the biggest TV networks, newspapers, you name it.
[03:10:35.345 --> 03:10:37.105]  How long have you had NoMoreFakeNews.com?
[03:10:37.105 --> 03:10:39.266]  Because notice, they claim fake news is their term.
[03:10:39.266 --> 03:10:44.127]  I know you've been calling them fake news for at least 15 years I've been interviewing you, John.
[03:10:44.127 --> 03:10:45.147]  15 years, Alex.
[03:10:45.147 --> 03:10:45.187]  2001.
[03:10:45.187 --> 03:10:48.368]  That's when it started.
[03:10:48.368 --> 03:10:50.789]  And it just seemed like the right thing to do.
[03:10:50.789 --> 03:10:52.629]  No more fake news.
[03:10:52.629 --> 03:11:02.772]  Because I was working as a reporter for 19 years already, and my basic target had turned into mainstream news.
[03:11:02.772 --> 03:11:03.532]  They were the fakers.
[03:11:04.215 --> 03:11:08.460]  Yeah, and you kind of had an inside lane there to see it from the show.
[03:11:08.460 --> 03:11:12.704]  So they're trying to claim that they may copyright it or trademark it trying to stop us.
[03:11:12.704 --> 03:11:13.906]  Seriously, that's in the news.
[03:11:13.906 --> 03:11:23.076]  You can actually show up and say, you could probably get the copyright now or the trademark, bro, and say, no, I decide who the fake news is, not the snopes lady and her obese cat.
[03:11:23.076 --> 03:11:23.997]  You can start nopes.
[03:11:24.864 --> 03:11:33.927]  Alright, well, we'll sell it for maybe $20 billion, and we'll spread the money around, and then we'll just, you know, deep-six them completely.
[03:11:33.927 --> 03:11:37.708]  I don't mean to jump in here on your hour, and I appreciate you doing this, Mr. Rappaport.
[03:11:37.708 --> 03:11:40.989]  We've got a few callers I wanted to get to first, and then we're going to punch out of here.
[03:11:42.009 --> 03:11:45.952]  I wanted to banter with you, and ladies, jump in at any time here.
[03:11:45.952 --> 03:11:49.694]  What do you make of them expelling entire facilities of Russians?
[03:11:49.694 --> 03:11:51.736]  Not just a few diplomats, that's been done before.
[03:11:51.736 --> 03:11:53.957]  What do you make of the open war talk?
[03:11:53.957 --> 03:12:00.482]  Whether somebody's for Israel or against it, clearly they're triggering a new Inifada to get a war going in the Middle East.
[03:12:00.482 --> 03:12:04.765]  Is this to keep Trump from getting in, or to give him such a crisis that it drives down the economy?
[03:12:04.765 --> 03:12:07.667]  They're mad that we have Trump euphoria?
[03:12:07.667 --> 03:12:10.229]  What does your really tuned-in brain think?
[03:12:11.653 --> 03:12:15.915]  To create the biggest possible mess for Trump when he gets in.
[03:12:15.915 --> 03:12:20.897]  So that he has to, you know, this is a time-worn strategy, Alex.
[03:12:20.897 --> 03:12:25.079]  New president comes in, a new Congress, whatever.
[03:12:25.079 --> 03:12:32.402]  And the people who hate that are going to throw as much crap in the way of it as they possibly can.
[03:12:32.402 --> 03:12:33.102]  So it's scorched earth?
[03:12:33.905 --> 03:12:41.473]  Yeah, wind him up in so many crises that he can't think straight, can't put any policy into effect.
[03:12:41.473 --> 03:12:45.017]  He's got to deal with horrendous circumstances.
[03:12:45.017 --> 03:12:46.399]  That's the way it looks to me.
[03:12:46.399 --> 03:12:51.144]  And let's remember, while he's busy, it was $50 billion, then $60 billion, then $70 billion.
[03:12:51.144 --> 03:12:55.349]  It's over $100 billion of new jobs pledged next year by major companies.
[03:12:55.729 --> 03:13:12.501]  It's causing a huge domino cascade snowball effect, exuberance is exploding, a trillion plus in the stock market, people understand America's open for business, and the enemies that have hijacked the country that are foreign globalists are telling us that we're the Russian agents, John.
[03:13:12.501 --> 03:13:13.182]  Right.
[03:13:13.182 --> 03:13:18.746]  And that this is really bad because more employment is a very bad thing.
[03:13:19.818 --> 03:13:21.859]  As far as they're concerned.
[03:13:21.859 --> 03:13:27.581]  It's a really horrendous, terrible thing because it means things are succeeding.
[03:13:27.581 --> 03:13:28.761]  Jobs are showing up.
[03:13:28.761 --> 03:13:31.702]  People are going back to work that couldn't work before.
[03:13:31.702 --> 03:13:35.143]  This is total anti-globalism when stuff like this happens.
[03:13:35.143 --> 03:13:35.844]  And it's even worse.
[03:13:35.844 --> 03:13:45.207]  This guy likes having these rich, powerful daughters and sons and super sexy smart wife and oh my gosh and he really is multinational and he really is successful.
[03:13:45.207 --> 03:13:45.767]  They don't like it.
[03:13:46.348 --> 03:13:47.408]  No.
[03:13:47.408 --> 03:13:48.348]  They want failure.
[03:13:48.348 --> 03:13:53.370]  You know, because failure means they can be failures, which they already are.
[03:13:53.370 --> 03:13:55.770]  They haven't done anything productive in their whole life.
[03:13:55.770 --> 03:13:56.070]  That's right.
[03:13:56.070 --> 03:13:58.051]  George Soros, perfect example of projection.
[03:13:58.051 --> 03:14:02.532]  He says that Trump is a dictator and is going to be like Hitler, close quote.
[03:14:02.532 --> 03:14:03.352]  Right.
[03:14:03.352 --> 03:14:05.813]  Can you comment on that?
[03:14:05.813 --> 03:14:06.833]  Yeah.
[03:14:06.833 --> 03:14:07.413]  He's saying
[03:14:08.954 --> 03:14:09.974]  I'm just that way.
[03:14:09.974 --> 03:14:14.576]  I'm like Hitler, so therefore I look out there and that's what I see.
[03:14:14.576 --> 03:14:18.777]  I mean, it's the most ridiculous thing I've read in a long time.
[03:14:18.777 --> 03:14:26.780]  This guy who's like deep-sixing economies and sinking currencies and starting revolutions and so forth.
[03:14:26.780 --> 03:14:27.680]  Very Hitlerian!
[03:14:28.260 --> 03:14:29.861]  A true friend of democracy?
[03:14:29.861 --> 03:14:30.861]  Are you kidding?
[03:14:30.861 --> 03:14:35.243]  I mean, the guy, he's just a worm, a total lying... Exactly!
[03:14:35.243 --> 03:14:40.725]  Trump's built things, and then meanwhile Hitler was into taking things over and blowing things up.
[03:14:40.725 --> 03:14:42.366]  That's exactly what Soros does!
[03:14:42.366 --> 03:14:46.228]  If I had to pick anybody in the world that's Hitlerian, it's Soros!
[03:14:46.228 --> 03:14:47.688]  Right.
[03:14:47.688 --> 03:14:48.969]  This is what's happening.
[03:14:48.969 --> 03:14:53.131]  I mean, the psychology of the hard political left is
[03:14:54.164 --> 03:14:59.065]  We're losers, we're failures, we know that but we'll never admit it.
[03:14:59.065 --> 03:15:12.168]  So the only way we can stand living in the world is to pull everybody else down into our heap where everybody's a loser and then the government takes care of all of us and that's the only system that we will tolerate.
[03:15:12.168 --> 03:15:17.730]  That's why they're, you know, hating so much at the moment because they fear
[03:15:18.610 --> 03:15:20.910]  That success is coming, and that means so.
[03:15:20.910 --> 03:15:21.851]  They gotta get a job.
[03:15:21.851 --> 03:15:23.191]  In fact, he has a quote in there.
[03:15:23.191 --> 03:15:26.492]  He says, he says, we must stop the exuberance.
[03:15:26.492 --> 03:15:33.373]  Stop the exuberance.
[03:15:33.373 --> 03:15:35.373]  Stop the exuberance.
[03:15:35.373 --> 03:15:36.814]  The exuberant populism.
[03:15:36.814 --> 03:15:40.414]  There will be no more exuberance.
[03:15:40.414 --> 03:15:42.755]  There will only be depression.
[03:15:42.755 --> 03:15:45.496]  Oh, that's cute.
[03:15:45.496 --> 03:15:46.876]  Ashley, you want to jump in here?
[03:15:46.876 --> 03:15:47.176]  Margaret?
[03:15:48.338 --> 03:15:51.300]  Yeah, I think John is absolutely right.
[03:15:51.300 --> 03:15:54.021]  I mean, they definitely want to stop the exuberance.
[03:15:54.021 --> 03:16:00.344]  They want to end, you know, our basically rally here to change our country.
[03:16:00.344 --> 03:16:02.685]  We really want to make America great again.
[03:16:02.685 --> 03:16:06.527]  And they're going to do whatever it takes to try to stop that rally.
[03:16:06.527 --> 03:16:13.711]  So, you know, however they can bring down Trump, they're going to do that, you know, within the next 21 days, within the next year, his first year.
[03:16:13.711 --> 03:16:17.173]  So they can just, you know, try to say, hey, look what Trump has done.
[03:16:17.173 --> 03:16:17.613]  Absolutely.
[03:16:18.673 --> 03:16:21.234]  You could have the best New England Patriots football team.
[03:16:21.234 --> 03:16:24.996]  If they were all demoralized and thought they were losers, they would lose.
[03:16:24.996 --> 03:16:29.318]  We have an incredible system still left, but we've got to believe in it.
[03:16:29.318 --> 03:16:30.739]  And that means believing what's good in America.
[03:16:30.739 --> 03:16:33.540]  People say, oh now, you always bashed the system, now you say you believe in it.
[03:16:33.540 --> 03:16:35.561]  No, I bashed the globalist system.
[03:16:35.561 --> 03:16:39.242]  Now that we're getting the Americana system, I'm trying to get wind in its sails.
[03:16:39.242 --> 03:16:42.284]  It's happening, and the enemy is freaking panicking.
[03:16:42.284 --> 03:16:42.724]  Margaret?
[03:16:44.128 --> 03:16:52.231]  Oh I'm sorry, I was just going to say they're trying to rewrite history and tell us that America was never great in the first place.
[03:16:52.231 --> 03:16:53.851]  Mr. Rappaport, he hit it on the head.
[03:16:53.851 --> 03:16:56.112]  He said that he's trying to create the biggest mess.
[03:16:56.112 --> 03:16:58.873]  They're trying to create the biggest mess they can before Trump gets into office.
[03:16:58.873 --> 03:17:00.673]  Don't you just hate their arrogance?
[03:17:00.673 --> 03:17:01.913]  It is so smug.
[03:17:01.913 --> 03:17:04.634]  It's like, who died and made you?
[03:17:04.634 --> 03:17:11.376]  And it's the same arrogance and sense of entitlement that you see with radical Islam and even, you know, an aggressive Islamic culture.
[03:17:11.376 --> 03:17:12.657]  It's like, it's so entitled.
[03:17:14.097 --> 03:17:14.918]  Off already!
[03:17:14.918 --> 03:17:15.899]  It's a cult!
[03:17:15.899 --> 03:17:22.546]  And that's why you have the Council on Foreign Relations fearing the UN could collapse under President Trump.
[03:17:22.546 --> 03:17:23.426]  Oh no!
[03:17:23.426 --> 03:17:28.271]  He will shut down all of our globalist achievements because he's an unapologetic nationalist.
[03:17:28.271 --> 03:17:30.093]  Because the UN is trying to start a frickin' war!
[03:17:30.453 --> 03:17:41.125]  Right, and that's why they're going to start their own war so that he will have to deal with a huge mess because they're so afraid of not only of President Trump but also the fact that the Republicans have both houses.
[03:17:41.125 --> 03:17:42.907]  I don't think they're going to be able to shut this exuberance down.
[03:17:42.907 --> 03:17:44.489]  I think they're really earning themselves jail cells.
[03:17:45.350 --> 03:17:46.811]  I mean, this is true sedition.
[03:17:46.811 --> 03:17:49.512]  This is not free speech when you've got some weird Nazi collaborator.
[03:17:49.512 --> 03:17:51.253]  We're going to skip this network break to give Rob Portmore time.
[03:17:51.253 --> 03:17:54.015]  We're going to be out here in a few minutes, but he's co-hosting with us right now.
[03:17:54.015 --> 03:18:00.098]  We're going to be 24 hours in the future here with GCN, opening up another satellite with the great Ted Anderson.
[03:18:00.098 --> 03:18:01.459]  Let's go to Ruth in Florida.
[03:18:01.459 --> 03:18:02.099]  Ruth, thanks for holding.
[03:18:02.099 --> 03:18:03.340]  We're going to go to Debbie.
[03:18:03.340 --> 03:18:04.981]  Go ahead.
[03:18:04.981 --> 03:18:05.561]  Hi, Alex.
[03:18:05.561 --> 03:18:07.562]  Thanks to your team for all you do.
[03:18:07.562 --> 03:18:08.703]  We love you here in Florida.
[03:18:08.703 --> 03:18:09.643]  I just want you to know that.
[03:18:09.643 --> 03:18:10.104]  We love you, too.
[03:18:11.618 --> 03:18:13.200]  Let me tell you something.
[03:18:13.200 --> 03:18:21.166]  I'm calling you because I'm infuriated when I saw our globalists, McCain and Lindsey Graham, stand up and... It's like, our globalists, our cancer.
[03:18:21.166 --> 03:18:22.388]  It's like, our globalists!
[03:18:22.388 --> 03:18:23.148]  I mean, that's what I call them.
[03:18:23.148 --> 03:18:24.689]  It's like, our horrible scum.
[03:18:24.689 --> 03:18:25.090]  Go ahead.
[03:18:26.504 --> 03:18:32.106]  Oh, they're avoiding the Russians, you know, and I'm not forgetting your participation in the internet either.
[03:18:32.106 --> 03:18:37.327]  So, you know, there's no doubt that the GOP has a role in this, in my mind.
[03:18:37.327 --> 03:18:40.168]  Oh yeah, they're the ones, they're helping more than the Democrats pass it.
[03:18:40.168 --> 03:18:42.528]  Because people say, oh, you're a Republican.
[03:18:42.528 --> 03:18:44.769]  No, I like the guy the Republicans hate.
[03:18:46.886 --> 03:18:52.136]  I'd like to see them held accountable, and I don't think they should get a free get-out-of-jail card either with Trump.
[03:18:52.136 --> 03:18:53.699]  No, I agree.
[03:18:53.699 --> 03:18:54.160]  I agree.
[03:18:54.160 --> 03:18:54.721]  I agree.
[03:18:54.721 --> 03:18:56.425]  Where is this vindictiveness we kept hearing about?
[03:18:56.425 --> 03:18:57.326]  We need to see some right now!
[03:18:59.289 --> 03:19:00.930]  I think they need to be standing up.
[03:19:00.930 --> 03:19:04.013]  I mean, and we're hearing nothing, nothing from them.
[03:19:04.013 --> 03:19:07.576]  And so as far as I'm concerned, they're participants in all of this.
[03:19:07.576 --> 03:19:12.320]  Well, Trump to his, he knows he's got to get the engine going in the economy and the global economies on the verge of collapsing.
[03:19:12.320 --> 03:19:14.401]  It was supposed to collapse once Hillary got in.
[03:19:14.401 --> 03:19:15.722]  Now they're trying to collapse it on Trump.
[03:19:15.722 --> 03:19:16.423]  They admit that.
[03:19:16.423 --> 03:19:21.607]  And so he's racing on the phone like I'm talking 12 hours a day, just making phone calls.
[03:19:21.607 --> 03:19:22.808]  OK, I'm not going to get any more.
[03:19:22.808 --> 03:19:23.749]  But that's what he does.
[03:19:24.269 --> 03:19:28.752]  Just calling everybody, believe, believe, order more stuff, produce, produce, produce.
[03:19:28.752 --> 03:19:37.957]  He's trying to prop it up because, folks, he's got the intelligence officers who were in on the globalist plan who are now going against the globalists explaining this to him.
[03:19:37.957 --> 03:19:39.858]  So we're in a total battle.
[03:19:39.858 --> 03:19:42.580]  And I didn't agree with Bush after 9-11 saying go out and shop.
[03:19:43.320 --> 03:19:49.845]  But now we need to go out and shop for local stuff and get things we need to try to prop this up, folks, because we don't want this to go down.
[03:19:49.845 --> 03:19:53.408]  We've got to slowly reform the system, but for now we've got to prop it up.
[03:19:53.408 --> 03:19:55.129]  People are like, well, I thought you hate the system.
[03:19:55.129 --> 03:19:56.851]  I do, but we're living in it.
[03:19:56.851 --> 03:19:59.893]  Don't buy cheap communist crap, though, from the big boxes.
[03:19:59.893 --> 03:20:00.394]  Exactly.
[03:20:00.394 --> 03:20:02.135]  Buy local farmers markets.
[03:20:02.135 --> 03:20:02.675]  Right.
[03:20:02.675 --> 03:20:03.656]  Support your local.
[03:20:03.656 --> 03:20:06.318]  I want to get out of this house, but I'm living in it right now.
[03:20:06.318 --> 03:20:07.179]  Don't burn it down.
[03:20:07.179 --> 03:20:07.379]  Right.
[03:20:09.687 --> 03:20:10.268]  Thank you, Ruth.
[03:20:10.268 --> 03:20:11.210]  Great points.
[03:20:11.210 --> 03:20:14.095]  Jump in, any of you guys, and comment, and then we're going to go to Debbie.
[03:20:14.095 --> 03:20:16.499]  Foreign wars is a huge thing here.
[03:20:18.396 --> 03:20:20.337]  Globalists have lived off of this.
[03:20:20.337 --> 03:20:21.718]  The neocons, the globalists.
[03:20:21.718 --> 03:20:23.259]  We've got to attack somebody.
[03:20:23.259 --> 03:20:24.980]  Libya here, Iraq there.
[03:20:24.980 --> 03:20:29.383]  We've got to keep on empire, empire, destruction, destruction.
[03:20:29.383 --> 03:20:30.744]  That's their plan.
[03:20:30.744 --> 03:20:32.505]  We build on the ashes.
[03:20:32.505 --> 03:20:34.166]  We make our new world on the ashes.
[03:20:34.166 --> 03:20:37.268]  They want conquest instead of renaissance.
[03:20:37.268 --> 03:20:38.408]  Exactly.
[03:20:38.408 --> 03:20:41.971]  So the very thought, the possibility of a whisper of a
[03:20:42.811 --> 03:20:48.839]  of a thread that Trump might say, you know, as he has, this whole thing is completely stupid.
[03:20:49.605 --> 03:20:52.186]  We don't need to make any wars against anybody.
[03:20:52.186 --> 03:20:59.109]  We especially don't need to make any wars in order to prop up the economy if the economy is a roaring engine.
[03:20:59.109 --> 03:21:00.569]  So let's just stop all this.
[03:21:00.569 --> 03:21:02.790]  Let's bring a whole lot of troops home.
[03:21:02.790 --> 03:21:08.193]  And by the way, there are big giant studies from even the big hedge funds admitting, okay, we were following the records of the globalists.
[03:21:08.193 --> 03:21:09.493]  Trump's plan actually is going to work.
[03:21:09.493 --> 03:21:15.636]  We would annihilate China in a trade war and it would actually break their monopoly system and help the average Chinese worker.
[03:21:17.228 --> 03:21:24.392]  And then you would have, you know, the thought of not waging continuous wars and inventing endless enemies.
[03:21:24.392 --> 03:21:25.753]  Well, that's racist.
[03:21:25.753 --> 03:21:29.715]  This is like a silver bullet coming at a vampire.
[03:21:29.715 --> 03:21:31.636]  They see the end for them.
[03:21:31.636 --> 03:21:34.938]  If we can't do this, we don't have any more power.
[03:21:34.938 --> 03:21:37.760]  This is our only power is destruction.
[03:21:37.760 --> 03:21:39.181]  That's all we've got.
[03:21:39.181 --> 03:21:40.301]  And that's their program.
[03:21:40.301 --> 03:21:41.382]  Sure, I agree.
[03:21:41.382 --> 03:21:42.502]  And let's not underestimate here.
[03:21:42.502 --> 03:21:45.224]  Let me take one more call and let you take over.
[03:21:45.224 --> 03:21:46.405]  John Rappaport, NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[03:21:48.399 --> 03:21:49.761]  Let's not underestimate how evil they are.
[03:21:49.761 --> 03:21:55.729]  I agree they're trying to wreck things for Trump, but I think they're planning something bigger.
[03:21:55.729 --> 03:22:01.957]  It's possible that they want to just sink the ship as far as it can go down before Trump takes office.
[03:22:01.957 --> 03:22:05.622]  They could make it really, really bad if they want to.
[03:22:06.644 --> 03:22:19.033]  Yeah, I know David Knight said something about when Trump got elected and, you know, we were both kind of a little hesitant to celebrate and he said, you know, David, it is kind of like David beating Goliath, but he didn't actually kill him until he cut off his head.
[03:22:19.929 --> 03:22:25.132]  So that's, you know... Well, that's what I've been saying to Trump, and I said, David only knocked him down with a stone.
[03:22:25.132 --> 03:22:26.993]  You gotta chop the head off, bro.
[03:22:26.993 --> 03:22:29.314]  Or Goliath's gonna get back up.
[03:22:29.314 --> 03:22:29.574]  Right.
[03:22:29.574 --> 03:22:30.895]  They're gonna plan something even bigger.
[03:22:30.895 --> 03:22:32.256]  And this was a huge hit to them.
[03:22:32.256 --> 03:22:33.617]  Yeah, we gotta cut their head off.
[03:22:33.617 --> 03:22:34.517]  And I don't mean that literally.
[03:22:34.517 --> 03:22:36.158]  They're gonna say, Alex Jones have cut their heads off.
[03:22:36.158 --> 03:22:37.239]  He's joined ISIS.
[03:22:37.239 --> 03:22:38.379]  We've gotta cut the head off.
[03:22:38.379 --> 03:22:41.541]  Let's talk to Debbie.
[03:22:41.541 --> 03:22:44.703]  Debbie from New Jersey, go ahead.
[03:22:44.703 --> 03:22:45.884]  You ladies all kick ass.
[03:22:45.884 --> 03:22:46.384]  Good for you.
[03:22:49.633 --> 03:22:51.794]  He just looks like a hideous toad.
[03:22:51.794 --> 03:22:52.154]  He does.
[03:22:52.154 --> 03:22:54.315]  I'd like to see him done in.
[03:22:54.315 --> 03:23:09.740]  But I wanted to point out, Alex, that we are considered Russian agents because they have us listed as enemies of the state via their two constitutions, one for the United States and one of the United States.
[03:23:09.740 --> 03:23:14.001]  They took our sovereignty when they took our birth certificates, our lives.
[03:23:14.728 --> 03:23:16.811]  No, that's true.
[03:23:16.811 --> 03:23:18.873]  The IMF and World Bank, they really do all that.
[03:23:18.873 --> 03:23:20.916]  That's what we call natural resources and the rest of it.
[03:23:20.916 --> 03:23:24.461]  And Trump knows all that and is trying to end it.
[03:23:24.461 --> 03:23:25.181]  Exactly.
[03:23:25.181 --> 03:23:26.984]  And I knew you knew that.
[03:23:26.984 --> 03:23:29.687]  But that's also why Obama is hiding out in D.C.
[03:23:29.687 --> 03:23:32.471]  because of the 10 square miles of sovereignty he's got.
[03:23:32.998 --> 03:23:33.358]  That's right.
[03:23:33.358 --> 03:23:34.159]  Let's make no mistake.
[03:23:34.159 --> 03:23:37.781]  You're witnessing the attempt to take America back from the globalists.
[03:23:37.781 --> 03:23:40.623]  That's why Soros says, the new world order is dying!
[03:23:40.623 --> 03:23:42.464]  I mean, they are in deep crap.
[03:23:42.464 --> 03:23:43.445]  We must stop him.
[03:23:43.445 --> 03:23:44.145]  And here's the message.
[03:23:44.145 --> 03:23:50.349]  I've been thinking, we need to call the globalists, call the White House, call everybody and say, look, we know you're starting the wars.
[03:23:50.349 --> 03:23:53.611]  We know you're behind the attempt to drive up interest rates to drop the economy.
[03:23:53.611 --> 03:23:55.212]  We know it's you.
[03:23:55.212 --> 03:23:58.575]  So you're not going to blame the American people or Trump if this thing goes
[03:23:59.431 --> 03:24:02.473]  You're going to get in trouble, scum!
[03:24:18.413 --> 03:24:24.981]  The mortgages being as fraudulent as they are, how everybody has their own federal account that they're given at birth based on their birth weight.
[03:24:24.981 --> 03:24:32.830]  Well, I remember people 20 years ago going, explaining how they would sell some houses 20, 30 times, and how Mears was all BS, and it all came out.
[03:24:32.830 --> 03:24:33.551]  The Patriots were right.
[03:24:33.551 --> 03:24:34.072]  Absolutely, ma'am.
[03:24:34.352 --> 03:24:35.092]  Alright, we're out of time.
[03:24:35.092 --> 03:24:37.834]  I've got to hand it over to Mr. Rappaport, who's here to host the show.
[03:24:37.834 --> 03:24:39.155]  It's always good to co-host with him briefly.
[03:24:39.155 --> 03:24:42.156]  We have free shipping until Monday.
[03:24:42.156 --> 03:24:44.798]  So, we're extending Christmas.
[03:24:44.798 --> 03:24:49.681]  50-25% off on the supplements, on the Hillary for prison shirts, on the Trumps by President.
[03:24:49.681 --> 03:24:50.881]  All of it funds this operation.
[03:24:50.881 --> 03:24:52.042]  We're obviously under attack.
[03:24:52.042 --> 03:24:55.024]  The reason to get them, though, is they're great products and fund the Operation 360Win.
[03:24:55.024 --> 03:24:56.925]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:24:56.925 --> 03:25:01.828]  30-second closing comment from the ladies here.
[03:25:01.828 --> 03:25:02.288]  From each of you.
[03:25:02.711 --> 03:25:06.733]  Well, I am taking Brain Force Plus as we speak, and it's working wonders.
[03:25:06.733 --> 03:25:11.636]  But yes, I think a lot of people just need to keep their wits about them, maintain their humanity.
[03:25:11.636 --> 03:25:17.159]  I understand there is a massive gaslighting campaign going on to try to drive us all insane.
[03:25:17.159 --> 03:25:25.203]  So yeah, I think that the call to action of just letting your representatives know that we're on to you and we're going to hold you accountable, I think is very important.
[03:25:26.474 --> 03:25:47.233]  Okay, I totally agree with that and I think that the American people, the best way that we can actually support Trump's administration and rebuild America is to actually think with kind of a global mindset and like you were saying, take action locally to try to change things and you know, make our communities individually greater.
[03:25:47.233 --> 03:25:50.236]  That's right, co-op, all the stuff they claim they're doing.
[03:25:50.376 --> 03:25:59.279]  We have these people moving from California, for instance, taking over our community roles here and changing the way Austin's government structure is run.
[03:25:59.279 --> 03:25:59.859]  No!
[03:25:59.859 --> 03:26:00.279]  Heck no!
[03:26:00.279 --> 03:26:01.759]  We need to get back in there.
[03:26:01.759 --> 03:26:03.760]  I am so encouraged by your last caller.
[03:26:03.760 --> 03:26:04.940]  What a brilliant lady.
[03:26:04.940 --> 03:26:06.241]  She really has her head screwed in straight.
[03:26:06.241 --> 03:26:07.861]  And it's indicative of the climate.
[03:26:07.861 --> 03:26:09.282]  We're seeing it change.
[03:26:09.282 --> 03:26:12.183]  And people that have been awake for a long time, they're finally speaking out.
[03:26:12.183 --> 03:26:16.304]  And hopefully, you know, having some ladies on this panel, we can encourage more women to do this.
[03:26:17.264 --> 03:26:19.305]  Hey, it's women out there fighting the new world order.
[03:26:19.305 --> 03:26:21.925]  Most of the men are sitting there sucking their thumbs, so it's awesome.
[03:26:21.925 --> 03:26:23.525]  That's right.
[03:26:23.525 --> 03:26:24.126]  Fantastic.
[03:26:24.126 --> 03:26:26.646]  Nightly News comes tonight with all you guys, 7 o'clock central.
[03:26:26.646 --> 03:26:28.746]  Okay, Rappaport, thanks for letting us jump into your show.
[03:26:28.746 --> 03:26:30.087]  25 minutes of it.
[03:26:30.087 --> 03:26:31.347]  Take over, my friend.
[03:26:31.347 --> 03:26:33.107]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:26:33.107 --> 03:26:35.488]  All right, here we go, folks.
[03:26:35.488 --> 03:26:45.870]  You see a story up on InfoWars now about the mumps vaccine and people with getting mumps who've gotten the vaccine.
[03:26:46.980 --> 03:26:49.108]  No surprise, no surprise.
[03:26:49.108 --> 03:26:51.557]  I just want to read a quote here from a piece that's up.
[03:26:52.406 --> 03:26:53.686]  Now, no more fake news.
[03:26:53.686 --> 03:26:56.547]  Let's see, where is it here?
[03:26:56.547 --> 03:27:15.391]  Between 1984 and 1989, the CDC, Centers for Disease Control, sent Iraq at least 80 different bio-war agents, including botulism, toxoid, and dengue virus.
[03:27:15.391 --> 03:27:17.011]  CDC, we're talking about.
[03:27:17.912 --> 03:27:19.293]  You know who they are?
[03:27:19.293 --> 03:27:23.015]  Centers for Disease Control?
[03:27:23.015 --> 03:27:28.177]  The agency of the federal government that loves you to death?
[03:27:28.177 --> 03:27:28.618]  Literally?
[03:27:28.618 --> 03:27:31.259]  That wants only the best for you?
[03:27:31.259 --> 03:27:34.681]  That knows that all vaccines are safe and effective?
[03:27:34.681 --> 03:27:36.542]  That buys three billion or so?
[03:27:37.847 --> 03:27:45.913]  Dollars worth of vaccines every year from manufacturers and then claims that they do vaccine studies that have no conflict of interest.
[03:27:45.913 --> 03:27:46.934]  Of course not.
[03:27:46.934 --> 03:27:48.515]  How could that be?
[03:27:48.515 --> 03:27:59.984]  And of course, major media do not pick up on any of what I'm talking about here because fake news has several strategies, maybe the most important of which is omission.
[03:27:59.984 --> 03:28:03.126]  It's called leaving things out.
[03:28:03.126 --> 03:28:05.127]  So let me read that again to you because
[03:28:06.048 --> 03:28:34.615]  If you don't know much about the Centers for Disease Control, and you can see the source on this quote if you read the story at NoMoreFakeNews, between 1984 and 1989, the CDC sent Iraq at least 80 different, Iraq, at least 80 different bio-war agents, including botulism, toxoid, and dengue virus, and these are the people of CDC that, you know, the public says, well, we have to trust them.
[03:28:35.779 --> 03:28:39.520]  Whatever they say about vaccines, it must be real, it must be true, right?
[03:28:39.520 --> 03:28:41.361]  I mean, isn't that so?
[03:28:41.361 --> 03:28:45.882]  Well, do you trust somebody who shipped out of the U.S.
[03:28:45.882 --> 03:28:51.984]  to Iraq in the 1980s to Saddam?
[03:28:51.984 --> 03:28:56.526]  80 bio-warfare agents?
[03:28:56.526 --> 03:28:57.566]  Think about that.
[03:28:57.566 --> 03:29:01.448]  Do you trust that organization or do you not?
[03:29:01.448 --> 03:29:05.409]  Do you trust the major media when they only briefly reported on it?
[03:29:06.147 --> 03:29:08.649]  And then let it slide and go away?
[03:29:08.649 --> 03:29:16.294]  Do you trust the Department of Justice who did no investigation and sent nobody to jail for this?
[03:29:16.294 --> 03:29:17.755]  Do you understand what I'm getting at here?
[03:29:17.755 --> 03:29:19.136]  I hope so.
[03:29:19.136 --> 03:29:21.158]  I hope so.
[03:29:21.158 --> 03:29:22.819]  So I'm an investigative reporter.
[03:29:22.819 --> 03:29:25.421]  I've been around for 30 more years.
[03:29:25.421 --> 03:29:29.163]  35, I guess it is now.
[03:29:29.163 --> 03:29:33.867]  Doing stories about fake news.
[03:29:35.854 --> 03:29:38.056]  I gravitated to that almost immediately.
[03:29:38.056 --> 03:29:39.177]  Fake news.
[03:29:39.177 --> 03:29:43.019]  And where is it coming from?
[03:29:43.019 --> 03:29:50.265]  We'll see.
[03:29:50.265 --> 03:29:51.666]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.666 --> 03:29:54.208]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.208 --> 03:29:56.910]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.328 --> 03:30:03.408]  A heartbreaking update this morning.
[03:30:03.408 --> 03:30:08.210]  Debbie Reynolds, age 84, mother of Carrie Fisher, has died of a suspected stroke.
[03:30:08.210 --> 03:30:11.230]  Her last words, quote, I want to be with Carrie.
[03:30:11.230 --> 03:30:18.132]  Carrie Fisher, her famous daughter, Princess Leia, of course, died of a heart attack on a flight from London to LAX earlier this week.
[03:30:18.132 --> 03:30:23.273]  Debbie Reynolds died this morning, hours after suffering a stroke, at her son Todd Fisher's house.
[03:30:23.273 --> 03:30:27.494]  The 84-year-old was planning her daughter's funeral when she suddenly took ill around 1 p.m.
[03:30:27.494 --> 03:30:28.134]  in the afternoon.
[03:30:28.134 --> 03:30:28.754]  She was rushed
[03:30:28.874 --> 03:30:34.618]  From their house in Beverly Hills to a nearby hospital, but died shortly thereafter, her son later revealed.
[03:30:34.618 --> 03:30:42.563]  Now, Todd, the last family member remaining, said that his sister's death was just simply too much for his mother, and she died longing to be with her daughter.
[03:30:42.563 --> 03:30:47.146]  Carrie Fisher died on Tuesday, four days after a heart attack on board a flight.
[03:30:47.146 --> 03:30:53.430]  And the Star Wars actor, she was in the middle of promoting her memoirs, The Diarist, and she was thought to be in good health.
[03:30:53.430 --> 03:30:54.311]  Here's what we know.
[03:30:54.311 --> 03:30:56.512]  Debbie Reynolds has died, age 84.
[03:30:56.512 --> 03:30:58.614]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for InfoWars.
[03:30:59.014 --> 03:31:01.415]  Hey, everyone!
[03:31:01.415 --> 03:31:07.537]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:31:07.537 --> 03:31:09.618]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:31:09.618 --> 03:31:19.901]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:31:19.901 --> 03:31:25.863]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:31:26.343 --> 03:31:41.180]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[03:31:41.220 --> 03:31:41.701]  I think so.
[03:32:00.439 --> 03:32:09.723]  As we get ready to kick off 2017, it's more important than ever to realize it's the First Amendment that allowed us to defeat the globalist witch Hillary Clinton.
[03:32:09.723 --> 03:32:13.424]  And these enemies of free speech are out there telling us, don't say Merry Christmas.
[03:32:13.424 --> 03:32:14.725]  In fact, don't even say holidays.
[03:32:14.725 --> 03:32:16.085]  Well, I got news for them.
[03:32:16.085 --> 03:32:23.888]  Just because of them doing that, I'm going to extend our Christmas sales right through into 2017.
[03:32:23.888 --> 03:32:26.169]  We're talking store-wide free shipping and free
[03:32:26.669 --> 03:32:30.152]  50 to 25% off on the Nutraceuticals and so much more.
[03:32:30.152 --> 03:32:42.162]  So whether it's a Hillary for Prison 2017 shirt or whether it's Survival Shield X2, our super male vitality, we've got the biggest sales of 2016 right into 2017 while supplies last.
[03:32:42.162 --> 03:32:46.525]  We are selling out of many of these items because this sale is so big and we've extended it.
[03:32:46.525 --> 03:32:47.886]  So please take advantage of this.
[03:32:47.886 --> 03:32:55.392]  And again, thank you for fighting for the Infowar and supporting our operation and supporting not just the First Amendment, but free speech worldwide.
[03:32:55.632 --> 03:32:59.467]  That's InfoWarsStore.com or go right to the supplements at InfoWarsLive.com
[03:33:10.442 --> 03:33:11.883]  You want answers?
[03:33:11.883 --> 03:33:13.583]  Well so does we.
[03:33:13.583 --> 03:33:17.245]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:17.245 --> 03:33:23.108]  John Rappaport back in the fourth hour sitting in for Alex.
[03:33:23.108 --> 03:33:33.052]  There were about six different ways I could have gone today and I'm still still maneuvering here because here's the deal folks.
[03:33:33.052 --> 03:33:37.934]  I've been around the reporting game for over 30 years so I've known lots of reporters.
[03:33:39.241 --> 03:33:45.027]  Lots of reporters, some editors, people who work in the mainstream.
[03:33:45.027 --> 03:33:45.888]  What are they doing?
[03:33:45.888 --> 03:33:48.250]  What's their psychology?
[03:33:48.250 --> 03:33:51.734]  First of all, their talent's spotted.
[03:33:51.734 --> 03:33:53.476]  You understand what that means?
[03:33:53.476 --> 03:33:58.641]  Somebody picks them out and says, this kid is fairly smart, he's kind of bright, let's bring him in, it could be good.
[03:33:58.641 --> 03:34:02.305]  And he believes what we want our people to believe.
[03:34:03.346 --> 03:34:04.607]  Already.
[03:34:04.607 --> 03:34:06.149]  He believes in globalism.
[03:34:06.149 --> 03:34:10.933]  He believes that we're all one happy sappy global village.
[03:34:10.933 --> 03:34:17.238]  He believes that parents should be taking care of their own kids if the state wants to intervene.
[03:34:17.238 --> 03:34:22.763]  He believes that communities should be planned by the United Nations if necessary.
[03:34:22.763 --> 03:34:26.627]  People live in little tiny little spaces and so forth.
[03:34:26.627 --> 03:34:29.169]  Kick people who are living out in so that my
[03:34:29.189 --> 03:34:29.750]  We're good to go.
[03:34:44.178 --> 03:35:00.305]  Guy walks through the door, he's 24 years old, he's got a master's degree from, you know, jerk university, and oh yes, very good, and sits down, and right away the editor who's interviewing him, or the personnel guy at the New York Times, or wherever it is,
[03:35:01.565 --> 03:35:12.377]  Sniff, sniff, sniff, yep, I can smell this guy is a liberal, which means he's really a globalist, and he's a communist, and he's a socialist, and he doesn't even have to know what that means.
[03:35:12.377 --> 03:35:14.159]  You know, the reporter.
[03:35:14.159 --> 03:35:17.542]  He just thinks he does, so that's what we want.
[03:35:17.542 --> 03:35:22.468]  And then he can write articles from the angle that we want him to write articles from, and that's how the game works.
[03:35:24.178 --> 03:35:34.888]  How do you think universities over the last 40 or 50 years have become so stacked full of socialist idiots and scum?
[03:35:34.888 --> 03:35:35.729]  I mean, real scum.
[03:35:37.159 --> 03:35:39.781]  Scum from here down to the ground.
[03:35:39.781 --> 03:35:43.964]  These are the people who are saying, there's no such thing as the individual.
[03:35:43.964 --> 03:35:45.946]  The individual is extinct.
[03:35:45.946 --> 03:35:47.747]  There is only the collective.
[03:35:47.747 --> 03:35:51.270]  And everything is for the good of the greatest number of people and so forth.
[03:35:51.270 --> 03:35:54.272]  And, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:35:54.272 --> 03:35:59.216]  The student's parents are paying, you know, whatever it is, 50 grand a year for this.
[03:35:59.216 --> 03:36:02.098]  Or the student's taking out a loan that he'll never be able to repay.
[03:36:03.987 --> 03:36:10.772]  The university is soaking the kid because they can, because the government is guaranteeing the loan program.
[03:36:10.772 --> 03:36:11.653]  It's a total hype.
[03:36:11.653 --> 03:36:12.173]  It's a joke.
[03:36:12.173 --> 03:36:16.557]  There is no more higher education in America.
[03:36:16.557 --> 03:36:19.879]  It's gone, except in a few technical fields.
[03:36:19.879 --> 03:36:21.681]  It's absolutely gone.
[03:36:21.681 --> 03:36:22.821]  It's done.
[03:36:22.821 --> 03:36:24.623]  What has taken the place of it is
[03:36:26.584 --> 03:36:33.409]  Globalists, socialists, they kind of, they meet, you see.
[03:36:33.409 --> 03:36:39.193]  And the people that hire those instructors and professors, they can smell them too.
[03:36:39.193 --> 03:36:43.376]  Oh yeah, I get that whiff of strong socialism from this guy, yeah.
[03:36:43.376 --> 03:36:49.080]  And he's kind of nasty, and he's, yeah, yeah, he looks a little bit like George Soros.
[03:36:49.978 --> 03:36:51.299]  So we like him right away.
[03:36:51.299 --> 03:36:57.684]  He's kind of a frog, somewhere between a frog and a monitor lizard.
[03:36:57.684 --> 03:36:58.184]  Good!
[03:36:58.184 --> 03:36:59.906]  This is a guy we want.
[03:36:59.906 --> 03:37:03.909]  This is a guy we want to teach the young in this country.
[03:37:03.909 --> 03:37:10.934]  Work, a job, a paycheck, supporting yourself, being responsible, never heard of it.
[03:37:11.977 --> 03:37:14.739]  That's the old world, folks.
[03:37:14.739 --> 03:37:19.681]  The people we're hiring to teach at the universities now, we can smell them.
[03:37:19.681 --> 03:37:29.246]  They are utopians that are going to bring us into the paradise of equal sharing for all, everything for nothing, blah, blah, blah.
[03:37:29.246 --> 03:37:31.908]  And of course, for kids, that's great, right?
[03:37:31.908 --> 03:37:33.369]  I mean, they already have a lot of things.
[03:37:33.369 --> 03:37:35.750]  They have a cell phone, they have this, they have that.
[03:37:35.750 --> 03:37:39.252]  Okay, so the promise of, you know, you don't have to work.
[03:37:39.252 --> 03:37:40.432]  Why should you work?
[03:37:40.432 --> 03:37:41.253]  Who wants to work?
[03:37:42.503 --> 03:37:43.772]  Just coast along.
[03:37:44.790 --> 03:37:52.712]  on the consumer goods of society that will be dealt to you because you're entitled from birth to them.
[03:37:52.712 --> 03:37:55.973]  And you're now part of the elite because you're actually in college.
[03:37:55.973 --> 03:37:57.734]  It doesn't really mean anything.
[03:37:57.734 --> 03:37:58.834]  It doesn't add up to anything.
[03:37:58.834 --> 03:38:00.635]  You're not learning anything.
[03:38:00.635 --> 03:38:02.175]  You're not becoming smarter.
[03:38:02.175 --> 03:38:03.756]  You're actually becoming dumber.
[03:38:03.756 --> 03:38:11.458]  But it's the status of being in college and becoming a graduate, which you will if we have to push you out the door with a certificate.
[03:38:11.458 --> 03:38:13.559]  It doesn't matter what you learn.
[03:38:14.119 --> 03:38:23.546]  This is all a covert op that is now completely out in the open at universities, at media institutions, in government.
[03:38:23.546 --> 03:38:29.911]  Who do you think is working all these bureaucratic jobs that mean nothing in government?
[03:38:29.911 --> 03:38:41.199]  You think these are people who are self-reliant and really want to get ahead on their own hook and have a vision of the future of what it is that they want to create for themselves?
[03:38:42.381 --> 03:38:50.146]  You really think those are the people that are working at federal agencies and state agencies and city governments as bureaucrats all over the country?
[03:38:50.146 --> 03:38:51.947]  No!
[03:38:51.947 --> 03:38:57.311]  They're collecting up the people who don't want any of that.
[03:38:57.311 --> 03:39:00.053]  And yet will say, well I have a job.
[03:39:00.053 --> 03:39:01.134]  Yeah.
[03:39:01.134 --> 03:39:07.058]  I have a perpetual job and that's good because I don't really have to do anything.
[03:39:07.058 --> 03:39:08.719]  Why should I do anything?
[03:39:09.386 --> 03:39:18.968]  Why should I go out on a hook and actually earn, by my own efforts, a living?
[03:39:18.968 --> 03:39:19.928]  No.
[03:39:19.928 --> 03:39:20.928]  We're all against that.
[03:39:20.928 --> 03:39:21.948]  That's gone.
[03:39:21.948 --> 03:39:24.189]  That was some crazy idea a long time ago.
[03:39:24.189 --> 03:39:25.329]  We've rejected all that.
[03:39:25.329 --> 03:39:27.569]  It's called capitalism, free market, whatever.
[03:39:27.569 --> 03:39:28.650]  You know, it was a hard thing.
[03:39:28.650 --> 03:39:35.391]  It destroyed the world, except we the globalists rescued it at the last minute, and now we thought we had
[03:39:36.653 --> 03:39:43.395]  We've gotten back on course completely with Hillary Clinton, but she just fell apart.
[03:39:43.395 --> 03:39:45.436]  Couldn't handle it.
[03:39:45.436 --> 03:39:47.676]  So now we really got a problem.
[03:39:47.676 --> 03:39:51.877]  Because whoever this guy Trump is, he's not her.
[03:39:51.877 --> 03:40:01.460]  Whoever this guy is, however big an egotist he might be, whatever his real agenda is, he's not her.
[03:40:01.460 --> 03:40:03.741]  He's talking about crazy stuff.
[03:40:04.707 --> 03:40:12.718]  Like getting corporations to come back to America after they stole all the jobs and took them overseas.
[03:40:12.718 --> 03:40:15.962]  He's talking about creating new jobs.
[03:40:15.962 --> 03:40:17.084]  All kinds of new jobs.
[03:40:18.257 --> 03:40:27.008]  We'll see what he does, but that's what he's saying, and he's blaming these multinational corporations and the globalists for destroying the American economy.
[03:40:27.008 --> 03:40:34.297]  And believe me, the economy was destroyed, and it still is destroyed, because all the employment numbers are complete!
[03:40:35.216 --> 03:40:36.376]  Baloney.
[03:40:36.376 --> 03:40:39.457]  Complete baloney about the recovery.
[03:40:39.457 --> 03:40:40.578]  Yes.
[03:40:40.578 --> 03:40:52.421]  The Messiah says, I just want to remind you as I exit from the White House into my new role as the prophet of liberalism, that we brought back the economy.
[03:40:52.421 --> 03:40:54.902]  No, you didn't.
[03:40:54.902 --> 03:40:56.323]  No, you didn't.
[03:40:56.323 --> 03:40:58.123]  You didn't even get close.
[03:40:58.123 --> 03:40:59.924]  It wasn't even close.
[03:40:59.924 --> 03:41:01.924]  It's still horrific.
[03:41:01.924 --> 03:41:03.165]  Part-time jobs.
[03:41:04.355 --> 03:41:11.478]  Jobs that have endings, little gigs, contract gigs, these are all counted in point figures.
[03:41:11.478 --> 03:41:14.940]  It's all complete crock.
[03:41:14.940 --> 03:41:24.725]  Because the objective of globalism, and people find this hard to believe, is to torpedo economies.
[03:41:24.725 --> 03:41:26.946]  That's the op, folks.
[03:41:26.946 --> 03:41:29.287]  Torpedo economies.
[03:41:29.287 --> 03:41:33.049]  For example, let's say, hmm, we're going to fry
[03:41:34.278 --> 03:41:45.446]  The world is going to fry, and the only solution is that every country in the world has to sign on and agree to produce far less energy than they are producing now.
[03:41:45.446 --> 03:41:48.608]  That's the only way we can stop from frying as a planet.
[03:41:48.608 --> 03:41:54.833]  That means lower energy production, fewer jobs, economy goes into the tank, complete tank.
[03:41:55.694 --> 03:41:57.515]  But we call that utopia.
[03:41:57.515 --> 03:41:58.616]  This is the coming era.
[03:41:58.616 --> 03:42:01.899]  This is what we're going to do to save the planet.
[03:42:01.899 --> 03:42:06.082]  So a bunch of fake science is rolled out.
[03:42:06.082 --> 03:42:11.747]  And on that basis, that's what the globalists are going to do if they're not stopped.
[03:42:11.747 --> 03:42:24.677]  They're going to torpedo every single economy in the world because you take over people by first making them weak, confused, helpless, debilitated.
[03:42:24.677 --> 03:42:25.498]  That's the strategy.
[03:42:27.441 --> 03:42:30.423]  It's right in front of your face.
[03:42:30.423 --> 03:42:31.123]  It's not anywhere.
[03:42:31.123 --> 03:42:32.284]  It's not over here.
[03:42:32.284 --> 03:42:33.485]  It's not over there.
[03:42:33.485 --> 03:42:34.325]  It's not up here.
[03:42:34.325 --> 03:42:35.126]  It's not down there.
[03:42:35.126 --> 03:42:37.768]  The strategy is right in front of your face.
[03:42:37.768 --> 03:42:40.549]  This is what the globalists are doing.
[03:42:40.549 --> 03:42:46.493]  So this guy, this wild, talking, crazy cowboy comes along and says, nah, we don't want any of that.
[03:42:47.660 --> 03:42:51.463]  Plus, all you media people are liars.
[03:42:51.463 --> 03:42:53.124]  You know, you're chronic liars.
[03:42:53.124 --> 03:42:53.884]  That's what you are.
[03:42:53.884 --> 03:42:56.626]  You know, everybody knows it.
[03:42:56.626 --> 03:43:01.809]  Nobody's been willing to say it until now, but I'm running for president and I'm going to say you're all liars.
[03:43:01.809 --> 03:43:04.171]  Complete liars!
[03:43:04.171 --> 03:43:12.396]  From the tips of your toes all the way to the top of your head, that's all you do is lie, and then you lie some more, and then you lie some more, and that's what you do.
[03:43:12.396 --> 03:43:13.337]  And that's why
[03:43:14.847 --> 03:43:19.836]  You're helping to destroy the country because you're hiding the truth from people about what's happened.
[03:43:19.836 --> 03:43:22.040]  The globalist takeover.
[03:43:22.040 --> 03:43:25.807]  And so this fast-talking cowboy suddenly says, we're going to stop all that.
[03:43:27.810 --> 03:43:29.151]  You people want jobs.
[03:43:29.151 --> 03:43:30.852]  I know you want jobs to come back.
[03:43:30.852 --> 03:43:33.454]  I know you're hurting, and that's what we're going to do.
[03:43:33.454 --> 03:43:51.126]  We're going to prevent big corporations from taking jobs out of America, overseas, which is part of the globalist plan, and we're going to bring some of those companies back so the jobs are here, which is the anti-globalist plan.
[03:43:51.126 --> 03:43:51.987]  That's what he said.
[03:43:53.285 --> 03:44:18.256]  He didn't just say it once, he said it many times, over and over and over and over, until even Bernie Sanders began to speculate that maybe this guy Trump actually was serious, in which case Bernie said at a breakfast after the election was over, hey, if he means what he says, I would be willing to work with him on the issue of globalism and jobs.
[03:44:20.387 --> 03:44:21.789]  We'll see.
[03:44:21.789 --> 03:44:24.372]  Very soon, we'll see, folks.
[03:44:24.372 --> 03:44:36.265]  But just the whiff and the whisper and the possibility that Trump might be against globalism is making people shake in their boots.
[03:44:36.265 --> 03:44:41.211]  The scum of the media who are complete slaves to the globalist agenda.
[03:44:43.058 --> 03:44:55.102]  The globalist corporations who have been feasting off the American people as consumers for God knows how long without giving them jobs because they're taking those jobs overseas.
[03:44:55.102 --> 03:45:00.284]  Slave labor, no environmental controls of any kind.
[03:45:00.284 --> 03:45:01.945]  Sure.
[03:45:01.945 --> 03:45:04.806]  This is what Trump has been talking about.
[03:45:04.806 --> 03:45:05.466]  But of course,
[03:45:06.647 --> 03:45:14.733]  Of course, the academicians say, and the reporters say, and the politicians say, he doesn't mean any of this.
[03:45:14.733 --> 03:45:17.274]  He couldn't mean any of this!
[03:45:17.274 --> 03:45:22.238]  This is all just a fabrication, just a lie.
[03:45:22.238 --> 03:45:24.600]  He's just telling one lie after another.
[03:45:24.600 --> 03:45:30.524]  Well, if he's telling one lie after another, then he's not going to do anything to injure globalism, right?
[03:45:30.524 --> 03:45:30.884]  Correct?
[03:45:31.522 --> 03:45:33.783]  That's what you mean when you say he's a liar.
[03:45:33.783 --> 03:45:35.124]  So what are you so worried about?
[03:45:35.124 --> 03:45:49.551]  Why are you so exercised and worked up and afraid and terrorized and panicked that this guy who's coming in as a president, whom you say is not going to really do anything about globalism, then what are you worried about?
[03:45:49.551 --> 03:45:55.494]  Why are you shaking in your pants every night and drinking yourself to sleep?
[03:45:57.130 --> 03:45:59.232]  Tell me, I'd love to know.
[03:45:59.232 --> 03:46:03.115]  I would really love to know.
[03:46:03.115 --> 03:46:07.078]  And the answer is very simple.
[03:46:07.078 --> 03:46:21.910]  No one with access to major media, with significant access, is permitted to speak out vociferously against the globalist agenda or identify what that agenda is.
[03:46:22.836 --> 03:46:28.498]  Or point fingers at corporations or politicians, etc, etc.
[03:46:28.498 --> 03:46:36.082]  And some actual conservatives have come out of the woodwork who never spoke about globalism before.
[03:46:36.082 --> 03:46:38.823]  Have you noticed that all of a sudden in the last six months?
[03:46:39.827 --> 03:46:50.935]  They woke up and said, yes, globalism is the enemy, and Trump is talking about destroying globalism and replacing it with a nationality or nationalism or America.
[03:46:50.935 --> 03:46:51.615]  Wow!
[03:46:51.615 --> 03:46:53.337]  This is incredible!
[03:46:53.337 --> 03:47:02.743]  Why didn't you recognize three years ago, four years ago, when Romney was running and Bush was running, that they were arch-globalists?
[03:47:02.743 --> 03:47:04.064]  Why didn't you say anything then?
[03:47:04.064 --> 03:47:07.567]  Okay, you woke up now.
[03:47:07.567 --> 03:47:08.948]  You got on the bandwagon now.
[03:47:08.948 --> 03:47:09.408]  Good for you.
[03:47:12.304 --> 03:47:19.728]  This is the fear that Trump is not just lying through his teeth.
[03:47:19.728 --> 03:47:26.512]  That he actually is going to do something and has already begun doing it, bringing jobs back to America.
[03:47:26.512 --> 03:47:29.153]  Preventing them from leaving.
[03:47:29.153 --> 03:47:33.435]  And he hasn't even walked into the White House yet.
[03:47:33.435 --> 03:47:34.075]  So we'll see.
[03:47:34.075 --> 03:47:39.819]  I'm not betting the House or the farm or any of this.
[03:47:39.819 --> 03:47:40.539]  I'm not saying
[03:47:42.199 --> 03:47:47.683]  The greatness has arrived and everything is now wonderful, you know?
[03:47:47.683 --> 03:47:48.883]  Hope and change.
[03:47:48.883 --> 03:47:51.425]  I'm not going back there.
[03:47:51.425 --> 03:47:53.206]  Don't go back there, okay?
[03:47:53.206 --> 03:47:56.028]  Do not go back there.
[03:47:56.028 --> 03:48:07.756]  The movement of millions of people who have opted for Trump and the millions more around the world who are also waking up
[03:48:08.635 --> 03:48:16.858]  to the idea of their nation as opposed to the globe, the global village.
[03:48:16.858 --> 03:48:20.619]  These people, you, are the force.
[03:48:20.619 --> 03:48:29.102]  You are the basic, the major, the top, the inside, the outside, the left, the right, everything force.
[03:48:29.102 --> 03:48:30.642]  You are the force.
[03:48:30.642 --> 03:48:36.064]  You are what can keep this thing going and expanding by demanding that, in fact,
[03:48:37.031 --> 03:48:51.496]  We get rid of the scourge of the globalists that has taken over the world and has been, you know, determined to run it completely.
[03:48:51.496 --> 03:48:56.518]  And we haven't even gotten into the technocracy aspect of it, which is a whole other thing.
[03:48:58.157 --> 03:49:22.344]  That you, eventually, the plan being that you, as an individual human being, would have a card, and this would be an energy card, and you would carry it around with you, and every time you bought something, you would stick out the card, and they would take it and do something, you know, put it in the machine, and subtracted from your energy quota would be the cost
[03:49:24.443 --> 03:49:28.526]  of what it took to produce that particular item that you're buying.
[03:49:28.526 --> 03:49:32.790]  The cost in energy, not in dollars, in energy.
[03:49:32.790 --> 03:49:35.251]  You understand?
[03:49:35.251 --> 03:49:36.693]  You get an energy quota.
[03:49:36.693 --> 03:49:40.015]  Everybody has an energy quota and a card.
[03:49:40.015 --> 03:49:41.817]  And this is the control.
[03:49:41.817 --> 03:49:51.524]  And when the card runs out for the period of time for which it's intended, that particular aspect, you're done.
[03:49:51.524 --> 03:49:52.145]  No more energy.
[03:49:53.052 --> 03:49:59.635]  Gotta save the planet, gotta do this, can't let everybody fry, global warming is going to destroy us all, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:49:59.635 --> 03:50:07.118]  I put an article up today on No More Fake News, New York Times, January 26th, 1989.
[03:50:07.118 --> 03:50:12.000]  No evidence whatsoever of global warming trend in America.
[03:50:12.000 --> 03:50:18.443]  Study was done, you know, federal funded, in-house study.
[03:50:19.892 --> 03:50:23.274]  No warming over the last hundred years.
[03:50:23.274 --> 03:50:26.875]  No warming over the last hundred years.
[03:50:26.875 --> 03:50:30.797]  But of course, no, we can't pay attention to that because that has to be wrong.
[03:50:30.797 --> 03:50:32.258]  It has to be wrong because
[03:50:34.085 --> 03:50:54.582]  We have to have carbon taxes, and we have to have cap-and-trade, and we have to have lowered energy production, vastly lowered energy production in economies all over the world that will torpedo these economies and the people, meaning us, who are, you know, trying to make a living.
[03:50:54.582 --> 03:50:55.923]  We'll be back for the last segment.
[03:50:55.923 --> 03:50:57.405]  John Rappaport, InfoWars.
[03:51:01.038 --> 03:51:03.581]  Don't become dependent on the medical system.

[03:51:06.224 --> 03:51:10.209]  Metals in the liver cause peroxides to get dumped into the bloodstream.
[03:51:10.209 --> 03:51:21.182]  Peroxides do more damage than free radicals to the arteries, and the LDL has no protection from peroxides, causing the LDL to get stuck in the arteries, creating a potential blockage.
[03:51:21.622 --> 03:51:30.028]  Xtendivite slowly chelates the metals away from the liver so it can dispose of what was meant to be a harmless process, peroxide.
[03:51:30.028 --> 03:51:34.931]  Xtendivite's 7 herbs has a job to strengthen the organs and circulatory highway.
[03:51:34.931 --> 03:51:36.592]  Can you afford a heart attack?

[03:52:00.769 --> 03:52:03.791]  Hi, I'm Frank Thomas.
[03:52:03.791 --> 03:52:06.313]  When I was playing ball, they called me the Big Hurt.
[03:52:06.313 --> 03:52:09.916]  But after I left the game, Mother Nature started putting a big hurt on me.
[03:52:09.916 --> 03:52:12.118]  I just couldn't stay in shape like I used to.
[03:52:12.118 --> 03:52:14.240]  Turns out, it wasn't my fault.
[03:52:14.240 --> 03:52:19.465]  Once you hit 40, your body has less free testosterone, and that can make it harder to get into shape.
[03:52:19.465 --> 03:52:21.987]  But luckily, I found out about Nugenics.
[03:52:22.347 --> 03:52:30.654]  Nugenix is a unique man-boosting formula powered by Testofen, a patented key ingredient clinically researched to help boost your free testosterone levels.

[03:53:00.276 --> 03:53:11.141]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:53:11.141 --> 03:53:15.303]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[03:53:15.303 --> 03:53:17.444]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:53:17.444 --> 03:53:22.886]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:53:23.046 --> 03:53:33.055]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:53:33.055 --> 03:53:39.541]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:53:39.541 --> 03:53:42.864]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:53:42.864 --> 03:53:44.906]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:53:44.906 --> 03:53:48.029]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:53:48.029 --> 03:53:52.710]  John Rappaport, last segment here in the fourth hour, sitting in for Alex.

[03:55:32.627 --> 03:55:44.096]  Excellent products for you, and in the process, you support this operation called InfoWars, where you are getting all this information.
[03:55:44.096 --> 03:55:48.139]  So, don't pass it up.
[03:55:48.139 --> 03:55:49.600]  Okay, a few minutes left here.
[03:55:51.454 --> 03:55:58.697]  I started off talking about reporters and editors and how they recognize each other.
[03:55:58.697 --> 03:56:00.458]  That's really what it is.
[03:56:00.458 --> 03:56:02.319]  They smell the same smell.
[03:56:02.319 --> 03:56:04.600]  I mean, it really comes down to that.
[03:56:04.600 --> 03:56:06.400]  Oh yeah, he's one of us.
[03:56:06.400 --> 03:56:07.561]  Sure, he talks like us.
[03:56:07.561 --> 03:56:08.781]  I can tell he thinks like us.
[03:56:08.781 --> 03:56:09.742]  He acts like us.
[03:56:09.742 --> 03:56:12.703]  His attitude is like us.
[03:56:12.703 --> 03:56:19.686]  It's kind of like a semi-high IQ mucus, okay?
[03:56:20.768 --> 03:56:22.789]  That's what I think of it as.
[03:56:22.789 --> 03:56:31.953]  Oh yes, I'm spotting in Jones, our newest candidate for reporter, a semi-high IQ mucus.
[03:56:31.953 --> 03:56:33.014]  Yes, very good.
[03:56:33.014 --> 03:56:34.475]  Yes, I think he'll be fine.
[03:56:34.475 --> 03:56:35.695]  He'll be fine.
[03:56:35.695 --> 03:56:39.357]  One of us.
[03:56:39.357 --> 03:56:43.579]  And they are going all in.
[03:56:43.579 --> 03:56:49.882]  Risking everything, major media I'm talking about, with the most fantastical stories.
[03:56:51.109 --> 03:56:54.112]  You know, that are just ridiculous.
[03:56:54.112 --> 03:56:59.397]  The Russians and the Putin and this and that and all the fake news sites are really working for who?
[03:56:59.397 --> 03:56:59.777]  Russia?
[03:56:59.777 --> 03:57:00.338]  What?
[03:57:00.338 --> 03:57:05.683]  You know, they are going crazy.
[03:57:05.683 --> 03:57:07.705]  Literally crazy, though.
[03:57:07.705 --> 03:57:10.688]  Because they sense the end is near.
[03:57:10.688 --> 03:57:12.730]  The seesaw has swung.
[03:57:14.249 --> 03:57:27.952]  More people are now getting their actual news, which they are reading and listening and watching, not just, oh, I see, you know, from independent media, than from mainstream media.
[03:57:27.952 --> 03:57:29.913]  That's just the way it is.
[03:57:29.913 --> 03:57:30.593]  Why is that?
[03:57:30.593 --> 03:57:43.596]  Because people are sick and tired, not just of the lies, which are endless, but the way they're being fed the lies, as if these people who are doing it
[03:57:44.835 --> 03:57:46.516]  Are in charge.
[03:57:46.516 --> 03:57:53.337]  They've somehow been given the royal key to the royal chamber, and they're in charge, and they're not.
[03:57:53.337 --> 03:58:05.601]  And they're losing their livelihoods, and their pants, and their paychecks, and everything that they hold dear, and their reputations, are just going down the drain.
[03:58:05.601 --> 03:58:09.362]  And you, and I, and a lot of us are helping that to happen.
[03:58:10.917 --> 03:58:13.306]  More coming, you can be sure on InfoWars.
[03:58:13.306 --> 03:58:16.136]  John Rappaport, thanks for being here in the fourth hour.
