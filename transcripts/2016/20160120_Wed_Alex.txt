[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.742]  To the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:15.553]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.214 --> 00:00:17.235]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.996 --> 00:00:19.097]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.758 --> 00:00:20.559]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.241]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:26.487]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.067 --> 00:00:31.132]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.478 --> 00:00:36.899]  Well, the Bilderberg Group meets in secret to push world government.
[00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:46.963]  But Davos is basically made up of the exact same people, and over a thousand members of the media, and jetliners landing full of prostitutes.
[00:00:47.363 --> 00:00:55.586]  They're high atop a mountain right now in Davos, Switzerland, and they are scheming on how to basically further enslave the middle class.
[00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:56.646]  Here's a special report.
[00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:06.679]  The meeting to terminate the American middle class is underway atop a mountain of greed located in the highest town in the Alps, Davos, Switzerland.
[00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:20.229]  From January 20th to January 23rd, the invitation-only annual globalist event of 2,500 attendees includes 40 heads of state, a smattering of celebrities, and 14 Nobel laureates.
[00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.693]  The average ticket to the male-dominated assemblage costs $27,000 to attend.
[00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:39.301]  Reuters reports anti-poverty charity Oxfam announced that just 62 people, 53 of them men, own as much wealth as the poorest half of the entire world population.
[00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:45.685]  And the richest 1% of those own more than the other 99% put together.
[00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:49.547]  The wealth gap is widening faster than anyone anticipated.
[00:01:49.747 --> 00:01:56.431]  With the 1% overtaking the rest one year earlier than Oxfam had predicted only a year ago.
[00:01:56.771 --> 00:01:59.733]  Among the key figures in Davos will be U.S.
[00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:09.899]  Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the foreign ministers of both Iran and Saudi Arabia.
[00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:17.684]  As the global economy slows, populism grows, and the daily possibility of a derivative inflated bubble bursting
[00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:32.979]  Has world leaders and their mega corporate banking counterparts racing to close the diminishing gap on the American middle class as a hasty bid to reduce the United States to a third world nation dominated by surveillance technology?
[00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:40.787]  SIDICI Innovation CEO Rob Leslie, an agenda contributor for the 2016 World Economic Annual Meeting in Davos,
[00:02:41.047 --> 00:02:49.590]  Says the availability and resolution of imaging from satellites, drones, self-driving cars, and more will continue to increase exponentially.
[00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.832]  This will drive the creation of ever more sophisticated analysis algorithms, products, and companies.
[00:02:56.232 --> 00:02:59.953]  Basically trapping the American population like rats in a cage.
[00:03:00.353 --> 00:03:22.269]  Among the 250 closed-door meetings and elbow-rubbing parties will be discussions about the status of job-stealing robots, the current invasion of Europe and the United States by the engineered migration crisis, the shocking populism of Donald Trump, bragging of hidden redoubts, and a growing interest in fleeing Earth altogether for Mars.
[00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:28.233]  As the Gini coefficient, an indicator of the level of inequality Americans now live under,
[00:03:28.653 --> 00:03:31.554]  ...is now higher than the Philippines and Vietnam.
[00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:34.215]  Family debt levels continue to increase.
[00:03:34.635 --> 00:03:49.700]  The middle class has shrunken by over 11% since 1971, while President Obama and others continue to lie about job growth, which has stayed relatively flat in comparison to the skyrocketing corporate profit growth.
[00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:56.643]  So it would only make sense that the richer the very few get, the more paranoid they become.
[00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:07.190]  Basically, we're destabilizing the world, we're creating massive amounts of fear, and we're spending all of our money on surveillance and control.
[00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:15.839]  And I have a slide from Medard Gabel on how much we spend on war and how if we spend a third of that on peace,
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:24.268]  We could give every single person on the planet a two-story cinder block home with running water, electricity, and even a swimming pool.
[00:04:25.609 --> 00:04:33.958]  The injustice that is being perpetuated right now, we now know that 62 people on the planet have as much wealth as the lower 3 billion.
[00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:35.840]  This is insane!
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.305]  Concentration of wealth and I have my, you've showed it on your show before, my preconditions of revolution chart.
[00:04:42.765 --> 00:04:47.889]  The preconditions of revolution all exist in the United States of America today.
[00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:56.276]  We are like a house that has been soaked in gasoline with ammunition put in every room and we're just waiting for the first match to blow by.
[00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:58.218]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.311]  I tell you, John Brown does incredible reports every day for Infowars.com.
[00:05:05.331 --> 00:05:06.433]  We salute his work.
[00:05:06.513 --> 00:05:08.217]  We'll be back with the big transmission.
[00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:22.943]  The Intelligence Community's Inspector General has just revealed to lawmakers that Hillary Clinton had classified documents above Top Secret on her private email server, in addition to over 1,300 other classified emails.
[00:05:23.343 --> 00:05:32.313]  Access to information in the Special Access Program is more highly restricted, more sensitive than Top Secret, because it would likely reveal the source, putting lives at risk.
[00:05:32.873 --> 00:05:39.936]  We're constantly told that our money, our rule of law, our liberties must all be sacrificed on the altar of national security.
[00:05:40.116 --> 00:05:45.158]  Hillary has violated the surveillance state's religion, and she needs to be burned at the stake.
[00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.439]  Orange is the new pantsuit, Hillary.
[00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:54.602]  But she's being investigated by Obama's Justice Department, and she has about as much chance of going to jail as a Chicago cop.
[00:05:54.822 --> 00:06:00.385]  If she gets away with these crimes, the fraud of the surveillance state will be inescapably obvious to all.
[00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.953]  For more information, go to InfoWars.com.
[00:06:07.053 --> 00:06:08.033]  I'm David Knight.
[00:06:08.894 --> 00:06:15.839]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:07:08.622 --> 00:07:12.345]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:07:12.605 --> 00:07:18.730]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:25.895]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:35.002]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[00:07:35.302 --> 00:07:41.226]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:07:41.466 --> 00:07:46.009]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:49.652]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:07:49.892 --> 00:07:51.513]  No needles, no injections.
[00:07:51.793 --> 00:07:53.314]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:07:53.434 --> 00:07:54.475]  Try it for yourself.
[00:07:54.635 --> 00:07:56.196]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[00:08:26.283 --> 00:08:32.772]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:32.792 --> 00:08:34.315]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:44.471 --> 00:08:57.876]  The Dow has plunged another 450 points, S&P at lowest levels since late 2014, as oil continues its catastrophic slide into depressionary oblivion.
[00:09:00.297 --> 00:09:08.881]  The Baltic Dry Shipping Index is the lowest in its history, as not one ship
[00:09:10.612 --> 00:09:16.615]  Container ship in the last month, it's hard to believe but it's true, has moved between China and the United States.
[00:09:19.856 --> 00:09:27.799]  Rail carrying rates is at the lowest recorded in modern times.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:36.423]  We are in a cardiac arrest economically and Obama last Monday
[00:09:39.116 --> 00:09:46.182]  of last week told us that it was completely made up and pure propaganda in a fantasy world.
[00:09:47.223 --> 00:09:48.063]  What was the exact quote?
[00:09:48.083 --> 00:09:49.004]  Maybe we can find it again.
[00:09:49.024 --> 00:09:55.530]  That our economy wasn't the strongest in the world and doing great and getting stronger.
[00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.291]  I mean, he went on for like five minutes.
[00:10:02.655 --> 00:10:03.136]  It's wild.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:10.003]  We're going to be going over this today and opening the phones up in the first half of the broadcast.
[00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:15.446]  Global stock markets dive amid oil route developing.
[00:10:15.906 --> 00:10:18.848]  World faces wave of epic debt defaults.
[00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:22.410]  Russia's ruble hits all-time low.
[00:10:26.352 --> 00:10:28.693]  365 days until Obama leaves office.
[00:10:29.154 --> 00:10:32.936]  Yes, in less than 11 months he'll no longer be El Presidente.
[00:10:36.049 --> 00:10:44.156]  For the November election, but he won't be gone until the 20th of January 2017.
[00:10:44.536 --> 00:10:47.719]  He will be sitting in the Oval Office.
[00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:52.303]  The globalists have pushed for this for a long time.
[00:10:53.103 --> 00:11:00.750]  They are very close to having what the British Empire failed to do, and that is to have a complete planetary government.
[00:11:04.184 --> 00:11:07.409]  It is a very, very incredible time to be alive.
[00:11:13.038 --> 00:11:14.961]  Another headline from DrudgeReport.com.
[00:11:15.082 --> 00:11:18.307]  Chip enables brain to communicate directly with computer.
[00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:32.737]  Scientists find evidence of ninth planet in the solar system after delisting Pluto as a planet, naming it a member of the hundreds of objects in the Kuiper Belt.
[00:11:33.477 --> 00:11:39.261]  But now they have found another planet bigger than Pluto and are looking at listing it as a planet.
[00:11:42.043 --> 00:11:43.624]  We're going to get into that today as well.
[00:11:43.664 --> 00:11:45.445]  What an epic time to be alive.
[00:11:48.499 --> 00:12:00.962]  Women are beginning in polls to turn against Hillary as it comes out her brutal defense of her beard, Bill Clinton.
[00:12:03.082 --> 00:12:12.024]  When he would brutally rape women and they would settle the cases she would go out and attack dog them saying they were liars and have her feminist surrogates attack dog them.
[00:12:13.359 --> 00:12:22.107]  Because all they are is women more male than men who wish to slap around and control and put their boot on other women's throats.
[00:12:23.708 --> 00:12:27.271]  They're women that want to shove men out of the way at the trough.
[00:12:28.112 --> 00:12:29.093]  Predatory men.
[00:12:30.214 --> 00:12:40.123]  They want to shove them aside like rooting pigs at a slop feast and put their snouts in there themselves and dominate the great feminine energy.
[00:12:41.834 --> 00:12:43.194]  They're not feminine at all.
[00:12:44.175 --> 00:12:45.135]  They're dogs.
[00:12:46.535 --> 00:12:47.435]  Global warming!
[00:12:48.396 --> 00:12:52.837]  Major snowstorm may threaten DC, New York, but again they're saying it's global warming.
[00:12:53.257 --> 00:12:55.697]  That's some of the stories up on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:56.738 --> 00:12:58.678]  13 hours with the CIA and Hillary.
[00:12:58.838 --> 00:12:59.838]  Don't want you to see.
[00:12:59.858 --> 00:13:04.360]  Who will lead the UN to world domination?
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.020]  Another very important report.
[00:13:09.704 --> 00:13:15.766]  That's just some of the news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:13:17.606 --> 00:13:21.247]  Another headline, Louis Farrakhan exposes the real white devils.
[00:13:23.308 --> 00:13:25.288]  Oh yes, that video is up on the site.
[00:13:26.108 --> 00:13:36.011]  And we will be premiering today an hour-long
[00:13:37.429 --> 00:13:51.321]  Boil down of the two-hour Louis Farrakhan interview that I conducted two weeks ago today or yesterday in Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:13:52.823 --> 00:13:59.108]  And then the full interview, two plus hours, will go up this afternoon on InfoWars.com.
[00:14:01.047 --> 00:14:10.351]  We might as well just get the article from their newspaper, Final Call, that's a transcript of much of the interview and just post that and post the video in with it.
[00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:19.014]  But there are several excerpts we haven't aired yet ahead of that today where Louis Faircon dares the mainstream media to actually report on what he says in this interview.
[00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:25.449]  And he also talks about the Federal Reserve, the foreign banking cartel that controls America.
[00:14:25.809 --> 00:14:28.531]  And a lot of people will say, hey, I hate Louis Farrakhan.
[00:14:28.551 --> 00:14:35.075]  He's the black racist that says that white people are basically the devil and cannot be reformed.
[00:14:37.216 --> 00:14:39.837]  And Louis Farrakhan did say that 30 years ago.
[00:14:39.857 --> 00:14:42.319]  And he said less
[00:14:44.491 --> 00:14:53.496]  sensational, less infamous things since then, but still very incendiary, that are taken and put on the news out of context.
[00:14:53.596 --> 00:14:55.076]  And I'm not defending everything he said.
[00:14:55.817 --> 00:15:10.184]  I'm simply trying to have a coup against the globalists, and people like George Soros that want a race war in this country for destabilization, that if the Liberty Movement can de-escalate
[00:15:12.628 --> 00:15:38.096]  The developed fishers that are in the community, some real, some exacerbated, between whites and blacks and others, and come together against the real threat, the New World Order, that is manipulating our genetics, that is poisoning our water, that is forcing inoculations on us, that is engaged in just incredible levels of oppression.
[00:15:39.742 --> 00:15:43.404]  If we can do that, it is a giant victory.
[00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:50.127]  Now, I'm not likening Louis Farrakhan to Hitler, but let's use that analogy.
[00:15:53.309 --> 00:16:01.653]  If I could meet with Hitler in 1935, when he'd been in power two years, but hadn't committed giant atrocities yet,
[00:16:02.884 --> 00:16:07.628]  It hadn't been manipulated by the West, which has been declassified, into starting World War II.
[00:16:08.388 --> 00:16:10.149]  We could have changed the course of history.
[00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:23.880]  If somebody else could have talked to Hitler and gotten Hitler to change his views and to grow and to get outside the controlled paradigm, imagine how the world would be different today.
[00:16:28.763 --> 00:16:30.164]  Now, I use that allegory
[00:16:31.024 --> 00:16:48.053]  To pick a really bad guy to compare to Farrakhan, not because I think that fits, but just for the sake of argument, if you could get Hitler to change his mind, why wouldn't you go and try to do it like Mahatma Gandhi, who was friends with Hitler, did, in multiple letters?
[00:16:50.795 --> 00:16:51.875]  The two were pen pals.
[00:16:57.338 --> 00:16:58.699]  Both didn't like the British Empire.
[00:17:01.175 --> 00:17:08.259]  You can judge Gandhi for that, but Hitler was seen as a reformer even by liberals in Europe and the United States until about 1939.
[00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:11.221]  He was Time Magazine Man of the Year twice.
[00:17:11.721 --> 00:17:25.869]  So what I'm getting at here, he was in gardening magazines and vegetarian magazines and my grandfather, I remember hearing Dallas Radio praise him and play his speeches and translate it into English.
[00:17:30.103 --> 00:17:30.783]  It's the same thing.
[00:17:30.844 --> 00:17:35.767]  If I could meet with Obama and get him to change his mind and change his worldview, or grow, I would do it.
[00:17:36.047 --> 00:17:58.241]  If I could meet with David Duke and do that, I had David Duke on, and it was all just about scoring points, and I was literally trying to just get him to understand there's a larger threat against humanity than the threats he is postulating, and that people need to come together and just be against eugenics, and he just didn't want to hear it.
[00:17:59.238 --> 00:18:01.239]  And folks said, oh, David Duke won the debate.
[00:18:01.899 --> 00:18:03.299]  It wasn't really a debate.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:13.602]  It was me trying to have a discussion with somebody that is incendiary, and that is a major leader, probably the greatest, quote, white nationalist leader in the world.
[00:18:14.103 --> 00:18:16.363]  In fact, I think undoubtedly, hands down.
[00:18:16.923 --> 00:18:25.886]  Well, Louis Farrakhan, I was thinking about this last night, talking to Rob Duke, and talking to Josh Owens back there in their offices.
[00:18:26.366 --> 00:18:28.167]  Actually, we had a Facebook mention, so it's on video.
[00:18:30.145 --> 00:18:37.328]  Where we were just thinking aloud saying, you know, Louis Farrakhan is in the top ten most famous black people in history.
[00:18:39.709 --> 00:18:44.131]  And in the last hundred years, he's in the top five or six.
[00:18:45.331 --> 00:18:51.374]  And currently, he's probably the second most influential famous black person in the world after Barack Obama.
[00:18:52.154 --> 00:18:56.216]  When we talk about politics, not sports, because that comes and goes.
[00:18:59.855 --> 00:19:05.918]  The video is Farrakhan dash new poison found in water, because part of it's about Farrakhan, the other part's about what they found in the Flint water.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.301]  Because it's Barack Obama, then it's Louis Farrakhan.
[00:19:11.341 --> 00:19:24.689]  I mean, obviously, you could say it's somebody like Nelson Mandela, even more famous than him, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, about as famous as Louis Farrakhan, maybe more so with pop culture.
[00:19:26.573 --> 00:19:30.798]  And so it's important to do these type of things, and that's why we did it.
[00:19:31.458 --> 00:19:33.240]  And it's a very thought-provoking interview.
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.585]  The full two hour, basically nothing's cut out.
[00:19:38.846 --> 00:19:46.814]  It's not a proper term to say unedited, because we take parts where he talks about the same subject here, and then an hour later we put that together, put a lot of interesting historical clips in.
[00:19:46.854 --> 00:19:47.735]  It's kind of a documentary.
[00:19:48.973 --> 00:19:51.475]  That's going to go up the next few hours at InfoWars.com.
[00:19:51.896 --> 00:19:59.603]  But we're going to air large excerpts, about an hour of it, coming up at the bottom of the next hour through the third hour.
[00:19:59.884 --> 00:20:02.046]  And then David Knight's going to host with huge news.
[00:20:02.566 --> 00:20:08.332]  They have the BLM on video bragging about stealing the mine out in Oregon.
[00:20:09.284 --> 00:20:12.467]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?

[00:22:09.554 --> 00:22:10.935]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowicz.
[00:22:11.376 --> 00:22:13.337]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[00:22:13.898 --> 00:22:17.521]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[00:22:17.761 --> 00:22:26.228]  Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[00:22:26.569 --> 00:22:29.851]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[00:22:30.712 --> 00:22:33.813]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[00:22:33.853 --> 00:22:38.495]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[00:22:39.215 --> 00:22:43.457]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[00:22:44.157 --> 00:22:46.958]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[00:22:47.318 --> 00:22:49.559]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[00:22:50.399 --> 00:22:56.666]  Please go to IDStronghold.com and get the facts and the wallet sleeves or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.
[00:22:57.426 --> 00:23:02.652]  You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[00:23:03.052 --> 00:23:04.734]  It is as though the protection is free.
[00:23:05.415 --> 00:23:07.056]  Visit IDStronghold.com today.
[00:23:08.479 --> 00:23:09.240]  Shower filters.
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.981]  We're introducing the best yet.
[00:23:11.101 --> 00:23:15.044]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[00:23:15.184 --> 00:23:19.787]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.

[00:24:13.084 --> 00:24:16.267]  All right, let me break down the news right now.
[00:24:16.287 --> 00:24:17.689]  I'm gonna open the phones up as well.
[00:24:17.709 --> 00:24:21.412]  A free-for-all, long-time callers, first-time callers.
[00:24:22.433 --> 00:24:23.815]  You disagree, you agree.
[00:24:23.935 --> 00:24:25.757]  All I ask is you have a clear phone and be ready.
[00:24:25.777 --> 00:24:25.997]  800-259-9231.
[00:24:26.017 --> 00:24:26.077]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:26.097 --> 00:24:27.639]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:24:27.659 --> 00:24:29.280]  I don't know where to start.
[00:24:37.691 --> 00:24:57.112]  Every day now there's like five or six new videos of the migrants in Europe stabbing people, robbing people, trying to rape women, raping women, running around burning things, shooting guns in the air, hijacking cars, and then articles where the police will attack anybody that demonstrates against it.
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:05.263]  I mean, I've got a stack of news, and now Afghans saying, I can't stand being in Europe, I want to kill the Europeans and eat them.
[00:25:05.283 --> 00:25:07.564]  I mean, it just gets crazier and crazier.
[00:25:07.584 --> 00:25:12.105]  You've got all these liberal aid workers trying to bring food and stuff, and they get robbed and stabbed.
[00:25:12.706 --> 00:25:14.146]  I mean, it's just over the top.
[00:25:14.987 --> 00:25:17.988]  And then you ask, why is Europe doing this?
[00:25:20.749 --> 00:25:23.150]  Because they want to break the West.
[00:25:24.892 --> 00:25:26.073]  They want to make us submit.
[00:25:26.814 --> 00:25:27.855]  But then there's good news.
[00:25:27.915 --> 00:25:30.037]  Texas battling against tyranny as usual.
[00:25:31.338 --> 00:25:32.639]  Supreme Court to hear Obama.
[00:25:33.119 --> 00:25:34.200]  Immigration challenge.
[00:25:34.741 --> 00:25:40.446]  And I know this came out yesterday and we mentioned it, but notice it's Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton who's leading 26 states.
[00:25:43.493 --> 00:25:47.877]  in this lawsuit and now beginning lawsuits on the gun executive orders.
[00:25:48.517 --> 00:25:56.163]  Meanwhile, Larry Klayman, who successfully got the NSA spying overturned for over a year until another court reversed it.
[00:25:56.203 --> 00:25:57.204]  Now he's battling there.
[00:25:57.284 --> 00:26:05.450]  He's introduced a lawsuit to stop Obama's executive gun control grab.
[00:26:08.453 --> 00:26:09.534]  But let's go back to Ken
[00:26:11.052 --> 00:26:11.492]  Paxton.
[00:26:11.512 --> 00:26:22.735]  Remember last year, I said Paxton is filing suit on this, and on shutting down our power plants, and on going after the guns at that time, on executive actions, and so what'd they do?
[00:26:22.775 --> 00:26:23.816]  They indicted him.
[00:26:25.876 --> 00:26:36.939]  Through Democrats, they control, and through the politicized state police, I'm not saying all the state police are bad, but they've been federalized, folks, for all intents and purposes.
[00:26:36.959 --> 00:26:39.500]  It's very, very sad.
[00:26:40.922 --> 00:27:02.976]  And at a dinner, he talked to three people about a stock he thought was good when they asked him, and he'd forgotten to file a piece of paper that he was a financial instrument salesman, basically, a stock seller, and that he was involved in the company, even though he hadn't been involved or trading with stocks in over a year and a half.
[00:27:05.798 --> 00:27:10.101]  And all these other lawyers and experts looked at it and said, it's not even unethical.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.140]  They don't care, see?
[00:27:12.841 --> 00:27:28.809]  Hillary can take billions from foreign dictators to sell weapons, and order a stand-down in Benghazi, and be involved in all these other crimes, and Obama can have the IRS persecuting people publicly, and be caught lying, and she can be caught lying with classified emails, and it's no problem!
[00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:40.315]  But the Texas Attorney General, a protege of the Governor, who was Attorney General, stands up, and they've indicted him.
[00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:47.512]  See, they don't come as redcoats like they did in 1776 to arrest the Founding Fathers.
[00:27:51.634 --> 00:27:53.234]  They come with kangaroo courts.
[00:27:54.835 --> 00:28:01.377]  And in Travis County and in one other Texas County run by Democrats, you've seen them go after Ken Lay.
[00:28:04.759 --> 00:28:10.901]  And then he magically just disappears when he's supposedly going to be sent to prison.
[00:28:13.131 --> 00:28:18.037]  And that's because the Republicans and the Democrats at the top are basically the same people.
[00:28:18.317 --> 00:28:28.048]  But you look at places like Texas where people aren't doing anything wrong and they're being persecuted.
[00:28:30.373 --> 00:28:35.998]  And of course it was Enron and Al Gore and all the rest of them who developed the carbon tax fraud idea.
[00:28:36.819 --> 00:28:45.426]  Bipartisan, just like Republicans came up with the Obamacare screwjob, then they have their Democrat lackeys run it through over their idiot constituents.
[00:28:45.526 --> 00:28:51.332]  And I know I'm digressing, it's just, out of all the news, there's so much of it here, I mean I'm swimming in it.
[00:28:52.102 --> 00:29:00.167]  New planets being discovered in the solar system, and this crazy stuff in the economy, worldwide meltdowns happening, oil plunging, all the rest of it.
[00:29:02.748 --> 00:29:04.930]  Federal land grabs going on all over the country.
[00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:14.455]  But with the backdrop, all over the United States and all over Europe, they are indicting and arresting people for their speech.
[00:29:14.875 --> 00:29:17.277]  In France, in Germany, they don't even hide it.
[00:29:18.513 --> 00:29:28.858]  If you're a member of the Congress, or the Parliament, or the Government, or you're the number one presidential candidate and the leader of the fastest growing party in... France?
[00:29:33.473 --> 00:29:35.796]  You're the daughter of one of the most famous statesmen?
[00:29:36.617 --> 00:29:39.300]  And you say we're under Islamic invasion and they arrested her?
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.843]  And now they're fining her and about to arrest her again?
[00:29:42.484 --> 00:29:48.992]  Again, we are under insane levels of bizarro leftist oppression.
[00:29:49.092 --> 00:29:50.033]  It's not coming.
[00:29:50.934 --> 00:29:51.895]  It's here!
[00:29:52.916 --> 00:29:57.561]  And they're going for broke, and their constituents want to be screwed over.
[00:29:57.942 --> 00:29:58.843]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.323 --> 00:30:00.905]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:00.925 --> 00:30:04.249]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:04.929]  They're lunatics.
[00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:06.091]  They love to be abused.
[00:30:06.131 --> 00:30:06.952]  They love being dumb.
[00:30:10.709 --> 00:30:18.513]  Serving as a microcosm of the Obama administration, a real estate developer partially demolished the reputed birthplace of the Bill of Rights.
[00:30:18.793 --> 00:30:28.859]  The developer, Triple Crown Corp., secured a permit to demolish a two-story stone building, formerly known as James Bell Tavern, in Silver Springs Township, Pennsylvania.
[00:30:29.099 --> 00:30:38.025]  By the time a third of the building was destroyed, the city stopped the demolition because officials realized the Bill of Rights was conceived at the tavern during a 1788 meeting.
[00:30:38.065 --> 00:30:38.325]  Commenter W.C.
[00:30:38.345 --> 00:30:40.027]  Handy wrote to the local Sentinel newspaper.
[00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:51.496]  We have a Congress that is so intent on destroying the Bill of Rights.
[00:30:51.756 --> 00:30:56.642]  The building as it stands now is rather indicative of the current state of our Bill of Rights.
[00:30:56.942 --> 00:31:01.347]  Why not leave the building as it is to serve as a reminder to us all, he added.
[00:31:01.568 --> 00:31:05.172]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.064]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.

[00:32:54.052 --> 00:32:55.953]  Complete a short sign-up and you're part of the team.
[00:32:56.153 --> 00:32:59.214]  That's Infowarsteam.com or Infowarshealth.com.
[00:32:59.394 --> 00:33:05.557]  So many people call into my radio show and tell me how Longevity and the products at Infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[00:33:05.697 --> 00:33:06.998]  Check it out for yourself today.
[00:33:20.538 --> 00:33:24.360]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:28.822]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:34.424 --> 00:33:37.926]  There are so many incredible reports to play.
[00:33:38.966 --> 00:33:45.669]  Just during the break, we have those little news pieces instead of commercials sometimes, because I think information is even more important.
[00:33:47.665 --> 00:33:49.407]  Basically anything else we do, obviously.
[00:33:49.947 --> 00:33:54.832]  And it was Sha'Carri Jackson with a report about how they just demolished the birthplace of the Bill of Rights.
[00:33:57.114 --> 00:33:59.456]  Oh, and then remembered it was a historic building.
[00:34:00.077 --> 00:34:03.760]  Just a microcosm of what's happening everywhere else across the society.
[00:34:04.821 --> 00:34:09.666]  And then we have this report that I aired at the very start of the broadcast.
[00:34:11.015 --> 00:34:23.865]  And that little five-minute section that some stations don't carry that John Bowne did on the big Davos meeting that is kicking off that is the public version of the Bilderberg Group meeting.
[00:34:23.885 --> 00:34:26.467]  I'm going to be talking about that in a moment and going to your phone calls.
[00:34:26.807 --> 00:34:33.432]  And then another report we've got that David Knight filed on dumb and dumber smart guns.
[00:34:33.973 --> 00:34:36.314]  That's very informative but also very, very funny.
[00:34:36.855 --> 00:34:37.756]  And I've just got to say
[00:34:38.891 --> 00:34:51.842]  The brain trust of the reporters we've got here and the quality of information they're putting out is unprecedented and I know that many of their reports get seen and heard by millions of people.
[00:34:53.277 --> 00:35:01.844]  But then sometimes they put a report out, I don't air it on air, and it just gets 20,000 views on YouTube and a couple hundred thousand on the nightly news, which is still great.
[00:35:02.285 --> 00:35:13.495]  It's just that if the world could see that Davos report, if the world could see what we're doing, what we're covering, we could really turn things around very, very quickly.
[00:35:15.296 --> 00:35:16.137]  Because the globalists
[00:35:17.347 --> 00:35:19.008]  Really have stolen the future.
[00:35:19.529 --> 00:35:23.631]  They're a breakaway civilization and they're running with the ball towards the finish line.
[00:35:24.012 --> 00:35:26.113]  The general public's in a trance still.
[00:35:26.854 --> 00:35:27.994]  They're starting to wake up.
[00:35:28.014 --> 00:35:34.779]  They're starting to figure out that something's going on and they've been sleepwalking, but they need to really get awake fast.
[00:35:34.819 --> 00:35:38.622]  They need cold ice water in a big old, you know,
[00:35:39.727 --> 00:35:44.931]  Cooler, like at the end of a football game, dumping it on the winner of the team, on the head coach.
[00:35:45.572 --> 00:35:49.035]  We need ice buckets poured on the American people's heads.
[00:35:50.476 --> 00:35:53.458]  You know, you had the ice bucket challenge that was so viral a few years ago.
[00:35:53.478 --> 00:36:00.544]  All about raising money for, was it muscular dystrophy or something?
[00:36:00.584 --> 00:36:01.044]  I forget.
[00:36:01.925 --> 00:36:08.110]  What about an ice bucket challenge to wake up to the tyranny and wake up to the fact that our birthrights are all being stolen?
[00:36:09.269 --> 00:36:11.529]  And that's why I was so happy to interview Louis Farrakhan.
[00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:17.491]  I mean, I can shoot a Facebook mentions or do a YouTube video and it gets a million, two million, three million views.
[00:36:19.251 --> 00:36:22.532]  And used to maybe every 15 videos I did got a million, two million views.
[00:36:22.832 --> 00:36:24.512]  Now every third or fourth video does.
[00:36:24.532 --> 00:36:29.093]  And I'm not bragging, but I can just be sitting there talking about some news item and it gets three million views.
[00:36:29.393 --> 00:36:33.614]  And then we spend thousands of dollars, time, energy with a Farrakhan interview.
[00:36:34.134 --> 00:36:37.315]  And I hope it gets watched a million times on YouTube.
[00:36:38.194 --> 00:36:41.176]  It of course will be seen by millions of people here on the air, and heard.
[00:36:42.557 --> 00:36:58.488]  But it's really weird, like something you work incredibly hard on, that you put so much energy into, that's so important, that could really change things, it won't hit and be big, and then some other little side issue, or me arguing with somebody on the side of the street will be seen 20 million times.
[00:36:59.848 --> 00:37:01.870]  But you know, it's all in God's larger plan.
[00:37:03.553 --> 00:37:06.316]  And another thing is I hear all these rave reviews on the street.
[00:37:06.456 --> 00:37:10.840]  I hear all these rave reviews in the hallways by the crew members.
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:13.883]  You know, Leanne McAdoo talking about what Super Female Vitality has done for her.
[00:37:13.903 --> 00:37:15.905]  I'm going to do a plug right now and then go to the news and your calls.
[00:37:18.598 --> 00:37:33.446]  People on the street come up and tell me, you can read the reviews at InfoWarsLive.com, but Rob Doob, who wanted to do such a good job on the big full Farrakhan interview that's going to go up later this afternoon at InfoWars.com, we're going to be hearing big excerpts coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[00:37:34.867 --> 00:37:46.534]  He was sitting back there in Buckley's office talking about the rollout of the video today and news articles with it and things like that, and I was walking by from the water cooler
[00:37:48.237 --> 00:37:49.718]  And I'm going, no, it's incredible.
[00:37:50.438 --> 00:37:51.579]  You know, I really feel great.
[00:37:51.679 --> 00:37:53.099]  Coffee just won't do it for me.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.380]  But I worked till 6 a.m.
[00:37:55.561 --> 00:38:01.643]  yesterday getting it finished, and then came back in a few hours ago to make sure it had imported and dumped back out.
[00:38:01.664 --> 00:38:04.945]  And of course, the video had failed, so he's exporting the full interview again.
[00:38:04.985 --> 00:38:07.026]  That's what will come out a little bit later this afternoon now.
[00:38:07.046 --> 00:38:10.628]  You know, we have done the 50-minute one, 60-minute one.
[00:38:10.648 --> 00:38:11.708]  We're going to be airing on air.
[00:38:11.728 --> 00:38:12.369]  That's the boil-down.
[00:38:13.243 --> 00:38:15.784]  He said, but I tell you, brain force is the most incredible thing.
[00:38:15.824 --> 00:38:19.246]  I've tried other energy pills, and I'm just kind of sitting there by the door listening.
[00:38:20.107 --> 00:38:23.008]  But he goes, it's amazing the clean energy it just gave me right through.
[00:38:23.409 --> 00:38:26.490]  And then I went and slept a few hours, took some more, and I'm awake again.
[00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:29.952]  And I step around the corner and I go, I'm eavesdropping.
[00:38:30.012 --> 00:38:33.434]  I said, why don't you go do a video testimonial about that, dude?
[00:38:34.355 --> 00:38:35.435]  He goes, oh yeah, I should.
[00:38:35.455 --> 00:38:36.616]  I go, well, you're too tired.
[00:38:36.636 --> 00:38:37.016]  Do it later.
[00:38:37.056 --> 00:38:37.716]  But I said, you know what?
[00:38:38.377 --> 00:38:39.337]  It's spontaneous.
[00:38:39.437 --> 00:38:39.998]  It's real.
[00:38:40.278 --> 00:38:42.219]  I'm about to go do the plug of the hour.
[00:38:43.629 --> 00:38:44.809]  Which funds our operation.
[00:38:44.849 --> 00:38:49.750]  If you go read about BrainForce, and I don't promote them enough, but it is a, what do they call it, nootropic.
[00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:51.510]  Thought-based.
[00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:53.731]  And it's not based on stimulants, folks.
[00:38:53.791 --> 00:38:55.391]  It's got some green tea extract in there.
[00:38:55.671 --> 00:39:03.713]  It's based on some things that are prescription in Europe that really are brain food, brains based on, that's been key co-factors.
[00:39:04.113 --> 00:39:11.314]  There's a whole list of them, but we set out to make the best brain pill, and it also helps other nerves in the body, obviously, but
[00:39:12.446 --> 00:39:19.949]  The best neurological pill we could and it's amazing.
[00:39:20.949 --> 00:39:22.009]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:39:22.049 --> 00:39:25.991]  Instead of having afternoon coffee, I actually forgot to drink coffee this morning.
[00:39:26.011 --> 00:39:28.832]  I slept a little late today, didn't work out.
[00:39:29.152 --> 00:39:32.433]  So I'm having my cup of coffee, usually about one cup of coffee a day now.
[00:39:32.813 --> 00:39:35.314]  And if I'm out on the road doing stuff, I'm really tired.
[00:39:35.394 --> 00:39:36.514]  Coffee doesn't do it anymore.
[00:39:36.835 --> 00:39:40.696]  There's just a time in your life where you drink two cups of coffee and you're ready to go to sleep actually.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.441]  Brain Force, it's completely different.
[00:39:46.522 --> 00:39:47.522]  Try a bottle of it.
[00:39:47.822 --> 00:39:49.123]  It's got four and a half stars.
[00:39:49.484 --> 00:39:50.484]  People really love it.
[00:39:51.065 --> 00:39:51.605]  Read about it.
[00:39:51.685 --> 00:40:01.672]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise, because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[00:40:02.193 --> 00:40:06.036]  And without further ado, I want to get back in the news, but Dew is here in the control room.
[00:40:06.994 --> 00:40:07.154]  I don't
[00:40:22.074 --> 00:40:28.578]  But Rob Dew joins us with George Washington, banner behind him, fitting.
[00:40:29.239 --> 00:40:30.119]  Dew, you're amazing.
[00:40:30.379 --> 00:40:32.921]  Now, I told you to quit killing yourself four or five days ago.
[00:40:32.961 --> 00:40:36.683]  I said the interview is important, but my gosh, you guys are like making a film here.
[00:40:37.143 --> 00:40:39.005]  It's basically turned into documentaries, two of them.
[00:40:39.545 --> 00:40:43.207]  But you worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[00:40:44.768 --> 00:40:46.250]  And tell us what Brain Force did.
[00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:50.756]  I guess I just repeated what I heard you say, but tell folks what I was hiding around the corner listening to.
[00:40:51.217 --> 00:40:51.557]  Sure, yeah.
[00:40:52.058 --> 00:40:54.561]  So, last night I had been working all day.
[00:40:54.601 --> 00:40:58.126]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball with my five-year-old.
[00:40:58.246 --> 00:40:59.888]  I get in here at 8.30.
[00:41:00.289 --> 00:41:02.251]  Josh is in here finishing up working.
[00:41:03.092 --> 00:41:04.853]  And I was kind of run down.
[00:41:04.873 --> 00:41:07.394]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[00:41:07.775 --> 00:41:09.635]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[00:41:09.836 --> 00:41:11.356]  I hadn't had an intro for it.
[00:41:12.137 --> 00:41:14.378]  And I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[00:41:14.398 --> 00:41:15.178]  I popped two of them.
[00:41:16.059 --> 00:41:20.961]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like everything just kind of clears up in your head.
[00:41:21.121 --> 00:41:23.543]  If you have that fog, people know what the fog is.
[00:41:23.703 --> 00:41:24.143]  Oh, yeah.
[00:41:24.183 --> 00:41:27.044]  After I get off the air after three or four hours, I feel like I've been hit by a truck.
[00:41:27.385 --> 00:41:29.946]  A lot of times I forget and I go, wait, take another Brain Force.
[00:41:30.146 --> 00:41:30.667]  Exactly.
[00:41:31.067 --> 00:41:36.371]  And after that hit, I was super strong till about 2.30, 3 in the morning.
[00:41:36.451 --> 00:41:42.636]  I took another little break, walked around, finished up, and you know, it's a long, it's a long interview.
[00:41:42.736 --> 00:41:47.520]  Let me tell you, to go through everything, if you want, if you want to change one thing, you got to go through and make sure everything else is changed.
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.181]  So it's a lot of, uh,
[00:41:48.621 --> 00:41:54.525]  So, I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without BrainForce, and I'm almost sure of that.
[00:41:55.085 --> 00:42:01.509]  And then I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more BrainForce and came in.
[00:42:01.529 --> 00:42:08.314]  And I'm not going to do this every day, but I do want to add one more person who I got on BrainForce.
[00:42:08.354 --> 00:42:11.616]  Travis is detoxing from coffee, is what he says.
[00:42:11.656 --> 00:42:13.377]  He says, I'm trying to get caffeine out of my system.
[00:42:13.737 --> 00:42:20.803]  No, Travis didn't look bad, but he's lost weight, he looks more manly, and he always looked manly, but he really... He's like running around the office.
[00:42:20.903 --> 00:42:22.604]  He runs around the office now.
[00:42:22.804 --> 00:42:24.105]  And I said, hey man, try a brain force.
[00:42:24.125 --> 00:42:26.687]  He's got a Clint Eastwood look in his eye now, I'm not kidding.
[00:42:27.828 --> 00:42:32.031]  And he took it, and I walked by him 15 minutes later, and he was like, oh my god, this stuff works.
[00:42:33.332 --> 00:42:40.636]  You really won't believe it until you try it yourself, and all I can say is it works, and it works emphatically.
[00:42:40.716 --> 00:42:42.877]  I mean, it's not like, uh, I kind of feel better.
[00:42:43.117 --> 00:42:46.979]  You're going to notice the results within 15 minutes, if you're like me.
[00:42:47.019 --> 00:42:54.383]  And by the way, I've tried whole caplets of green tea, I've tried other stuff, and again, stimulants actually usually relax me.
[00:42:55.103 --> 00:42:58.165]  That's why alcohol is a stimulant for me, because I'm kind of the opposite.
[00:42:58.205 --> 00:42:59.205]  I guess I'm ADHD.
[00:43:00.266 --> 00:43:01.466]  That's what they showed when I was in school.
[00:43:01.526 --> 00:43:04.268]  But the point is bouncing off the walls, lots of energy.
[00:43:04.628 --> 00:43:06.349]  Stimulants make me calm.
[00:43:07.369 --> 00:43:08.890]  Depressants make me hyper.
[00:43:10.271 --> 00:43:17.215]  And so that's why I like brain force, is because if I got to work till 2, 3, 4 in the morning, a six-pack of beer used to do it.
[00:43:17.315 --> 00:43:18.955]  Now, nope, not gonna do the drinking.
[00:43:19.476 --> 00:43:21.217]  Gonna take the brain force, because coffee, again,
[00:43:22.037 --> 00:43:24.042]  In the morning wakes me up, makes me sleepy at night.
[00:43:24.603 --> 00:43:29.734]  I'm kind of digressing off into discussion of this, but I just heard the other part of your talk that, yeah, other stimulants don't work.
[00:43:29.754 --> 00:43:31.257]  Well, that's because this isn't really a stimulant.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:32.460]  It's...
[00:43:33.863 --> 00:43:36.185]  Got these compounds and factors in it.
[00:43:36.245 --> 00:43:44.853]  Folks can read the scientific facts themselves at ForrestLife.com that are building blocks in the brain for the electrochemical processes in the brain itself.
[00:43:45.673 --> 00:43:48.175]  Not something that just jazzes it and speeds it all up.
[00:43:48.255 --> 00:43:52.019]  It just allows the brain to operate with more efficiency.
[00:43:52.039 --> 00:43:53.760]  I think that's basically the way to describe it.
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:54.861]  Just try it, folks.
[00:43:54.881 --> 00:43:56.402]  You're supporting the broadcast regardless.
[00:43:57.103 --> 00:43:58.264]  Thank you so much, Rob Dew.
[00:43:58.304 --> 00:44:00.066]  Any other points about the Ferricon interview coming up?
[00:44:00.894 --> 00:44:02.595]  I hope people get this out to everybody.
[00:44:02.775 --> 00:44:04.797]  I hope they watch the 50-minute version.
[00:44:04.817 --> 00:44:06.378]  I hope they watch the two-hour version.
[00:44:06.418 --> 00:44:14.343]  I mean, it really is... I mean, you two guys coming together, I think, is a very positive thing in this world, especially with what we're going through now.
[00:44:14.663 --> 00:44:22.088]  And we need more people to come together, put aside petty differences, and really start making a stand against the people that are really trying to kill us.
[00:44:22.788 --> 00:44:23.909]  And it's not each other.
[00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:28.254]  We should not be, you know, trying to kill each other in the ground level.
[00:44:28.354 --> 00:44:33.180]  We should all be working together to get rid of, you know, the globalists and what they're doing to us.
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:40.468]  And notice that Farrakhan has said a few incendiary things right around the time of the interview and right after that has been national news all over everything.
[00:44:40.788 --> 00:44:42.691]  But when he says I support Trump,
[00:44:43.251 --> 00:44:53.777]  Not letting Muslims in until they vet who's coming in, because terrorists are coming in, when he says all this really incredible news-making stuff, zero coverage, because it's not what they want to portray.
[00:44:54.117 --> 00:44:54.597]  Exactly.
[00:44:54.617 --> 00:44:58.399]  They only want to portray the guy as a racist hate-monger, and who...
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.722]  You know, doesn't want to get anybody together.
[00:45:01.742 --> 00:45:03.843]  And I think that's exactly opposite of what he really is.
[00:45:03.923 --> 00:45:07.986]  And I went back and looked at a bunch of old interviews of him too, and he does say some fiery things.
[00:45:08.426 --> 00:45:14.670]  But I think all through that, and he said this in the interview that you did with him, you know, I have to look out for my people.
[00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:17.652]  And then once I've done that, we can all work together.
[00:45:17.672 --> 00:45:19.974]  And I think that's been his lifelong mission.
[00:45:19.994 --> 00:45:23.997]  Well, here's what I respect, and I disagree with some of the things he said in the past and even currently.
[00:45:24.761 --> 00:45:26.562]  But he's not a coward.
[00:45:26.602 --> 00:45:28.883]  He sat down and talked to us because he knows we're real.
[00:45:29.783 --> 00:45:34.745]  And all these other communist groups, socialist groups, establishment right-wing groups, they're all cowards.
[00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:36.165]  They won't sit down for a real interview.
[00:45:36.205 --> 00:45:37.546]  They don't want to debate their ideas.
[00:45:38.866 --> 00:45:41.907]  They just want to sit around and take things out of context.
[00:45:42.027 --> 00:45:46.549]  And, you know, we put some things in context where he said some really incendiary things I disagree with.
[00:45:47.289 --> 00:45:52.111]  But the year he was saying, you can't reform the white devils, we cut to
[00:45:53.251 --> 00:45:58.876]  Police dogs attacking black people and shooting them with fire hoses and black women being beaten over the head with billy clubs.
[00:45:59.217 --> 00:46:01.639]  You have to understand the context of when he said that.
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:13.851]  And I get people's anger and what's happened to them, but they can't take that experience now and the globalists use it as mind control to turn them into new political slaves on the Democratic Party plantation.
[00:46:14.191 --> 00:46:15.392]  And Farrakhan agreed with that?
[00:46:16.053 --> 00:46:18.535]  And he agreed that he has, quote, grown and changed.
[00:46:19.056 --> 00:46:21.618]  And folks, I've grown, I've changed as well.
[00:46:22.198 --> 00:46:24.620]  And that doesn't mean Faircon's gonna be perfect or I'm gonna be perfect.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:29.224]  Doesn't mean we're all gonna hold hands and, you know, jump down the yellow brick road, you know, into the sunset.
[00:46:30.105 --> 00:46:44.737]  It just means that I don't want to be in some mindless fight with black people or any other group when the globalists have farms all over the world with humanoids growing inside cows, sheep, pigs.
[00:46:46.684 --> 00:46:48.625]  And again, if you're a new listener, you're saying, this sounds insane.
[00:46:49.065 --> 00:46:50.926]  It's all over the news this week and last week.
[00:46:51.486 --> 00:46:53.266]  I knew about it 20 years ago and talked about it.
[00:46:53.827 --> 00:46:58.208]  Now it's public that they're growing humanoids.
[00:46:58.248 --> 00:46:59.429]  And you say, well, aren't there laws?
[00:46:59.509 --> 00:47:02.130]  No, because they're not considered animal or human.
[00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:08.192]  So the animal experimentation rules don't apply, and the human ones don't, because they've got it in law.
[00:47:08.232 --> 00:47:09.932]  They can do it 30 years ago.
[00:47:10.733 --> 00:47:12.093]  They've got humanities.
[00:47:12.793 --> 00:47:13.854]  It's just everything, folks.
[00:47:14.844 --> 00:47:19.286]  Yes, they've crossed humans with chimpanzees, great apes, you name it.
[00:47:19.386 --> 00:47:22.388]  And I know I just keep getting back to that every day.
[00:47:23.068 --> 00:47:31.493]  It's because, come on, folks, we really got to go and fight with each other in the streets and be stirred up by Michael Moore and George Soros.
[00:47:32.153 --> 00:47:34.014]  I get some of the police are out of control.
[00:47:34.114 --> 00:47:35.235]  It's a globalist program.
[00:47:35.315 --> 00:47:36.576]  I get they're shooting people in the back.
[00:47:36.816 --> 00:47:37.636]  They're getting indicted.
[00:47:37.676 --> 00:47:38.497]  They're getting in trouble.
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:45.423]  You know, it kind of kills the narrative, you know, when it's black cops in the back of the truck where the guy gets beat to death and he's black.
[00:47:46.303 --> 00:47:47.524]  There is police brutality.
[00:47:49.925 --> 00:47:54.748]  A hundred and something people, might as well be as high as 200 get killed questionably every year by police.
[00:47:55.268 --> 00:48:00.791]  Is 200 dead on the tops the big issue or is four or five million kids being aborted?
[00:48:01.351 --> 00:48:05.874]  See, they divert us off into all these distractions.
[00:48:07.354 --> 00:48:08.475]  I want to go out to break.
[00:48:12.602 --> 00:48:13.542]  You know what I'm going to do?
[00:48:13.642 --> 00:48:20.444]  I'm going to come back in the next hour, actually, and start directly with your calls, Frank and John and Liberty and Owen and Peter and others.
[00:48:21.425 --> 00:48:27.006]  But I do want to come back in the next segment and actually play Lewis Farrakhan on who the real white devils are.
[00:48:27.026 --> 00:48:34.629]  And then we're also going to play his clip where he says, I dare you, mainstream media, to actually look at what I really said.
[00:48:34.949 --> 00:48:41.771]  Because you would think it's newsworthy to have Lewis Farrakhan going, I've changed, and I don't basically think all the white people are the white devil.
[00:48:44.656 --> 00:48:45.937]  That's pretty news-making.
[00:48:47.278 --> 00:48:48.439]  But you notice it's not there.
[00:48:48.459 --> 00:48:53.642]  But see, that's why the mainstream media is dying, or has already collapsed in many areas, is because we are the media.
[00:48:54.003 --> 00:48:55.784]  You think no one will see this interview.
[00:48:56.064 --> 00:48:57.625]  You think no one will hear this interview.
[00:48:57.946 --> 00:48:58.766]  People will.
[00:48:59.347 --> 00:49:01.148]  And it's not about Louis Faire, Conor Alex Jones.
[00:49:01.688 --> 00:49:06.592]  It's the fact that whatever these interviews are, whatever the news is, the system doesn't want to see or hear.
[00:49:07.332 --> 00:49:10.815]  In the fourth hour, David Knight's going to play the video.
[00:49:11.075 --> 00:49:13.497]  The article's going up on InfoWars.com as we speak.
[00:49:15.043 --> 00:49:26.209]  Where the BLM, out there in Oregon, got caught on video bragging how they took that mine for themselves and how they're basically piratically stealing property.
[00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:29.131]  And so I get the wrong the Feds are committing.
[00:49:29.411 --> 00:49:31.312]  I get they control most of the land in the West.
[00:49:31.692 --> 00:49:33.453]  I get the fact it's under UN control.
[00:49:34.513 --> 00:49:35.354]  UN biospheres.
[00:49:35.414 --> 00:49:36.434]  I made a film about it in 97.
[00:49:36.715 --> 00:49:38.616]  I'm a huge land rights activist.
[00:49:38.916 --> 00:49:40.857]  I supported the Bundys when they had grazing rights.
[00:49:42.469 --> 00:50:03.103]  But clearly, having people in federal buildings, people being arrested driving federal vehicles around now, people being mailed boxes of sex toys, and then they gripe about it on TV, knowing the image is just ridiculous to make them look stupid, and the people walk into the traps, and it's just not a good place to have that fight.
[00:50:03.824 --> 00:50:04.825]  I'm allowed my opinion.
[00:50:05.385 --> 00:50:09.168]  And you notice, it's being borne out right now, that it's a very foolish errand.
[00:50:10.165 --> 00:50:13.828]  But you still have to admire people that are trying to do something.
[00:50:13.848 --> 00:50:19.432]  They're still a lot better than people that just sit around and watch the NFL all day and don't care.
[00:50:19.932 --> 00:50:22.274]  And look, I'm not judging people that watch the NFL.
[00:50:22.734 --> 00:50:27.397]  There's folks come to me like, hey it's not bad, I watch the NFL and I'm involved in the Liberty Movement too.
[00:50:27.698 --> 00:50:28.118]  I get it.
[00:50:28.318 --> 00:50:29.279]  I'm not talking to you.
[00:50:29.899 --> 00:50:34.783]  I'm talking to people that play fantasy football all day while their kids are getting hooked on heroin.
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:43.746]  Or people that don't buy their kids vitamins and don't give them enough good food to eat because they're busy spending all their money on Powerball.
[00:50:44.447 --> 00:50:45.888]  I'm talking to those people.
[00:50:46.189 --> 00:50:46.649]  And you know what?
[00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:49.311]  If you're feeling guilty, maybe there's a reason.
[00:50:49.772 --> 00:50:52.654]  Look, I feel guilty every day that I don't do more, okay?
[00:50:53.575 --> 00:50:58.039]  And quite frankly, I have to deal with it because none of us are perfect and I can't do everything.
[00:50:59.417 --> 00:51:05.120]  There's Rob Dew in there, powered by BrainForce, InfoWarsLife.com, and all your purchases make it all possible.
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:05.681]  We'll be back.

[00:51:08.842 --> 00:51:09.983]  Are you prepared to bug out?
[00:51:10.043 --> 00:51:18.007]  Infidel Body Armor and an Army Ranger have produced a high-speed DVD and book to show you how to drive in combat, patrol, and how to survive in combat.

[00:52:16.061 --> 00:52:19.222]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[00:52:19.543 --> 00:52:24.625]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[00:52:24.985 --> 00:52:26.206]  How is this even possible?
[00:52:26.486 --> 00:52:33.789]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[00:52:34.009 --> 00:52:41.432]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[00:52:41.652 --> 00:52:44.874]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[00:52:45.154 --> 00:52:52.561]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.

[00:54:48.909 --> 00:54:54.955]  Even though I was a little bit late getting back in the studio, it's okay because it's hard to turn off music like this, isn't it?
[00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:15.471]  I have never had more news to cover.
[00:55:15.691 --> 00:55:17.931]  I have never had more incredible things to talk about.
[00:55:17.991 --> 00:55:21.712]  I've never had more incendiary clips and just amazing things.
[00:55:22.872 --> 00:55:24.973]  And I've never been more speechless.
[00:55:26.733 --> 00:55:30.934]  I was just walking around in the hall earlier going over some news articles that were coming out of the printer.
[00:55:30.954 --> 00:55:38.196]  And the reason we always print articles that we look at is because so many times they change them, they remove them, and we want to have a hard copy.
[00:55:41.604 --> 00:55:44.947]  And it just kept hitting me that we're in a science fiction movie.
[00:55:46.028 --> 00:55:47.710]  How stupid racism is.
[00:55:48.311 --> 00:55:49.892]  How stupid infighting is.
[00:55:51.554 --> 00:55:53.396]  How stupid tribalism is.
[00:55:54.997 --> 00:56:02.765]  But it's all we've got, it's who we are, and it's real because people are being racist to white people and racist to black people.
[00:56:03.185 --> 00:56:05.468]  I look at YouTube, I look at InfoWars, I look at
[00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:20.492]  All these other sites where you can comment, and it is just a sea of people, it's still a minority, but it's like a third of it, calling each other the N-word, calling each other, you know, the honky word, calling, and then you go look, and most of it's bots.
[00:56:21.533 --> 00:56:23.033]  It's just people causing infighting.
[00:56:23.773 --> 00:56:26.213]  And I just think about what scum the elites are.
[00:56:26.774 --> 00:56:27.854]  But of course, it makes sense.
[00:56:27.874 --> 00:56:34.495]  They want the world, they want control, they want to dominate, they want the future, they're going to use whatever means they need to, to dominate.
[00:56:36.394 --> 00:56:48.930]  So they can mutate every plant, every fish, every animal, every human, and splice everything together and grow humanoids inside animals, and it's just not even a news item.
[00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:52.175]  They just report on it like they're talking about a new light bulb that came out.
[00:56:53.632 --> 00:57:00.854]  And it's so fantastical, the churches won't even talk about it, because they're just, won't even get into abortion, because that's, quote, political.
[00:57:01.154 --> 00:57:09.997]  So now they can't even get into humans being grown, and humans being crossed with apes, and fish, and just, and that's what we know about.
[00:57:10.037 --> 00:57:11.958]  Can you imagine what else is going on?
[00:57:13.994 --> 00:57:15.775]  Should I get to the Farrakhan promo?
[00:57:15.835 --> 00:57:16.115]  I have it.
[00:57:16.135 --> 00:57:17.016]  It's pretty powerful.
[00:57:17.076 --> 00:57:20.158]  Farrakhan on the Federal Reserve and the quote, real white devil.
[00:57:20.758 --> 00:57:22.599]  And you'll say, well, I already know all about the Federal Reserve.
[00:57:22.619 --> 00:57:24.761]  I don't need Farrakhan to tell me it's a private foreign bank.
[00:57:25.501 --> 00:57:29.023]  Farrakhan is the second biggest black leader in the world after Obama.
[00:57:29.344 --> 00:57:30.264]  Living black leader.
[00:57:31.405 --> 00:57:41.091]  The guy goes and speaks and like 300, 400, 500,000 people come out when he speaks in Libya or he speaks in South Africa or he speaks in Nigeria.
[00:57:43.274 --> 00:57:46.136]  So he is a major... See, people always think about demographics.
[00:57:46.557 --> 00:57:49.099]  On this radio station, we target males this age to that age.
[00:57:49.159 --> 00:57:52.001]  Or on this TV show, we target females this age to that age.
[00:57:52.361 --> 00:57:53.823]  I'm targeting everybody.
[00:57:54.003 --> 00:58:00.968]  Old, young, Russian, Chinese, Mexican, American, Eskimo, purple polka-dotted, flying purple people-eaters.
[00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:04.051]  I'm targeting everybody.
[00:58:07.634 --> 00:58:10.576]  I want people to watch and listen to me when they get internet in Africa.
[00:58:10.916 --> 00:58:12.518]  I want people to listen to me in Latin America.
[00:58:13.697 --> 00:58:23.150]  When some village has the UN turn on the computer for them, thinking they're gonna get brainwashed by popular culture, I want to have a major offensive in cyberspace, so the first thing they hear is Alex Jones.
[00:58:24.898 --> 00:58:27.520]  And let them know there's solidarity worldwide, pro-human.
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:35.306]  Humans better get together, because the decision's been made to get rid of us, and to merge with machines, and it's being set up to come up against us.
[00:58:35.346 --> 00:58:41.290]  But I'm here to tell you, humans don't get tough till they know they're under attack, and the pressure we're put under only make us stronger.
[00:58:41.790 --> 00:58:48.395]  I'm here to tell you right now, humanity is gonna fight, humanity's gonna overcome, humanity's gonna win!

[01:00:00.703 --> 01:00:06.927]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.389 --> 01:00:17.413]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:18.013 --> 01:00:21.035]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:21.055 --> 01:00:25.778]  Alright, I'm gonna go to John in Wyoming here in a moment.
[01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:31.788]  Then we're going to go to Owen, Peter, Liberty, Frank, and others.
[01:00:32.548 --> 01:00:37.091]  I'm going to air the promos on the Farrakhan piece that's coming up later in the hour.
[01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:50.979]  And then again, the full boil-down video will be posted the next hour and a half or so to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, Facebook, Twitter.
[01:00:51.019 --> 01:00:51.900]  Hope you get it out to everybody.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.181]  And then later this afternoon, the full
[01:00:55.330 --> 01:00:57.371]  Enhanced but unredacted interview.
[01:00:57.612 --> 01:00:58.092]  That's the term.
[01:00:58.112 --> 01:01:00.914]  I've been looking for the right term because I keep saying it's unedited.
[01:01:00.934 --> 01:01:01.614]  That's not true.
[01:01:01.634 --> 01:01:02.375]  That's not the right term.
[01:01:03.496 --> 01:01:05.297]  You know, you lie even when you're not trying to.
[01:01:05.317 --> 01:01:18.125]  You just don't get the right parlance on the nomenclature and the words you're using from the lexicon, I guess, or the thesaurus would be the proper word.
[01:01:20.327 --> 01:01:21.808]  It's unredacted.
[01:01:24.221 --> 01:01:29.142]  It's everything he basically had to say other than me saying, let's take a break, I gotta go to the bathroom.
[01:01:30.063 --> 01:01:36.724]  And then it's got a bunch of clips inserted in that have context historically to some of the things Farrakhan's talking about.
[01:01:37.405 --> 01:01:40.665]  Or if he talks about something that sounds outlandish, we'll show a news article about it.
[01:01:42.326 --> 01:01:44.547]  It's basically a film.
[01:01:45.487 --> 01:01:47.827]  So that'll be up later this afternoon.
[01:01:48.088 --> 01:01:49.548]  You know, I'm gonna go to John in Wyoming.
[01:01:49.588 --> 01:01:50.448]  He's on Trump and Hiller.
[01:01:50.508 --> 01:01:53.029]  But since I'm talking about Farrakhan, let's go to Frank.
[01:01:53.669 --> 01:01:55.231]  Because I'm intrigued by what it says on screen.
[01:01:55.291 --> 01:01:56.612]  Louis Farrakhan, David Duke.
[01:01:56.652 --> 01:01:57.453]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:01:57.473 --> 01:02:16.612]  Hey Alex, yeah I know it sounds crazy, but you know Duke's got, he's produced this film out there, I think it's on YouTube, and he's talking, it's called I think Divide and Conquer, Rule by Divide and Conquer, so he's very well versed in all this, but yeah I thought it would be a crazy idea to bring Louis Farrakhan
[01:02:17.305 --> 01:02:21.408]  No, it's a great idea.
[01:02:21.908 --> 01:02:26.591]  I will offer to fly David Duke and Louis Farrakhan here to be in studio.
[01:02:26.611 --> 01:02:30.333]  I'm not going to get into Farrakhan's personal issues, but he survived cancer.
[01:02:30.353 --> 01:02:31.454]  He's 80 plus years old.
[01:02:32.054 --> 01:02:34.036]  And so I'll tell you this.
[01:02:34.496 --> 01:02:38.358]  I mean, I think because Duke's young, I'm younger and better health probably.
[01:02:38.378 --> 01:02:40.960]  I mean, Farrakhan, I don't want to say he's in bad health, but you know, he's an old guy.
[01:02:42.441 --> 01:02:50.646]  You know, go where Farrakhan wants, and have a... everybody videotapes it, and do maybe a two-hour live videocast of it.
[01:02:51.146 --> 01:02:54.308]  I think that would be a very, very, very interesting type discussion.
[01:02:54.328 --> 01:02:56.449]  That's the stuff the mainstream media doesn't want to happen.
[01:02:56.829 --> 01:03:02.192]  They don't want to have, you know, those type of different perspectives at the same time having a discussion.
[01:03:02.492 --> 01:03:04.614]  I mean, it'd be great to have the head of the ADL there, too.
[01:03:05.754 --> 01:03:07.055]  Or to have, you know, Michael Moore.
[01:03:07.115 --> 01:03:08.596]  But you know, see, they don't do that.
[01:03:08.876 --> 01:03:10.037]  They want to control the narrative.
[01:03:10.057 --> 01:03:10.317]  Go ahead.
[01:03:12.216 --> 01:03:18.467]  Yeah, I mean, that would be, uh, I mean just have a genuinely open, uh, you know, conversation.
[01:03:18.588 --> 01:03:19.770]  And not just talking points?
[01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:21.052]  And not just talking points?
[01:03:22.312 --> 01:03:22.972]  Well, yeah.
[01:03:23.352 --> 01:03:26.733]  And, uh, you know, I mean, you're not going to see anything like that on the mainstream media.
[01:03:26.773 --> 01:03:38.655]  And, you know, a lot of people are used to getting that talking points where they have to have talking points in order to stay, uh, you know, in order, you know, cause they're used to the treatment that they get, their microphone being turned down.
[01:03:38.695 --> 01:03:40.936]  I mean, David Duke gets treated horribly by the media.
[01:03:40.976 --> 01:03:42.936]  They do everything they can to make him look silly.
[01:03:42.996 --> 01:03:47.097]  Well, I let David Duke talk about 60% of the time when he was on for two plus hours.
[01:03:47.577 --> 01:03:50.838]  And then he complained like 15 times that I wasn't letting him talk.
[01:03:52.423 --> 01:03:56.745]  And so, my issue was, people are going to say I let Farrakhan talk too much.
[01:03:56.765 --> 01:03:59.787]  I mean, I probably talk 5% of the time in this interview.
[01:04:01.207 --> 01:04:04.989]  Jake, I think Dr. Duke was overly sensitive with this treatment.
[01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:08.371]  But, you know, a lot of that, he's got a little bit of paranoia going there.
[01:04:08.391 --> 01:04:09.632]  You know, that's what he's used to.
[01:04:09.752 --> 01:04:10.772]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:04:10.872 --> 01:04:17.576]  I did try to reach out because they've openly announced at Davos and everywhere else that robots will replace us.
[01:04:17.836 --> 01:04:19.056]  The age of humans is over.
[01:04:19.417 --> 01:04:21.818]  I saw three or four mainstream articles saying it yesterday.
[01:04:22.438 --> 01:04:22.698]  Okay?
[01:04:23.099 --> 01:04:24.480]  So, we're screwed, man.
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:28.402]  They're putting genetic warfare garbage in the food and in the vaccines.
[01:04:28.823 --> 01:04:32.685]  I don't have time to mess with black racists, white racists, or any of it.
[01:04:33.386 --> 01:04:36.808]  I mean, we're dealing... It's like if space aliens invaded, okay?
[01:04:36.989 --> 01:04:38.029]  We gotta deal with them.
[01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:45.815]  And the globalists say that they're their own species, they're a breakaway species, they're creating an AI supercomputer to take over, they're creating an alien.
[01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:52.917]  Okay, they're blasting holes in different dimensions with the Hadron Collider that can create black holes, God knows what.
[01:04:53.237 --> 01:04:59.945]  We're not in Kansas anymore, and we don't have time to monkey around with infighting run by George Soros.
[01:05:00.105 --> 01:05:02.267]  I'm just, I just am tired of it.
[01:05:02.868 --> 01:05:03.529]  I'm tired of it.
[01:05:09.278 --> 01:05:12.001]  Will you enter the Matrix or fight its construction?
[01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:21.391]  As the World Economic Forum underway in Davos fantasizes about a future that doesn't need us, they openly talk about the imposition of new technologies to control us.
[01:05:21.871 --> 01:05:30.000]  The admission, for example, that driverless cars will be used as surveillance tools with CEO Rob Leslie saying, availability and resolution of imaging
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:35.082]  The demand from satellites, drones, and self-driving cars will continue to increase exponentially.
[01:05:35.422 --> 01:05:40.703]  In other words, these robot cars will be surveillance tools like satellites and drones.
[01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:53.107]  The Federal Department of Transportation is expected to create legislation outside of Congress's involvement this year to regulate communication equipment on cars that would communicate vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure.
[01:05:53.547 --> 01:05:57.912]  Detroit projects this to be a 46 billion dollar market in just four years.
[01:05:58.293 --> 01:06:01.816]  Or put another way, the price of cars is about to soar.
[01:06:02.037 --> 01:06:05.861]  Corporate profits and government surveillance, a match made in hell.
[01:06:06.201 --> 01:06:07.643]  This is David Knight for InfoWars.com
[01:06:08.726 --> 01:06:11.927]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:07.737]  I'm Alex Jones for Super Mel Vitality and InfoWarsLife.com, and I salute you, our supporters!
[01:08:20.009 --> 01:08:21.589]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:31.892]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:31.992 --> 01:08:40.735]  Coming up, later in the hour after I go through a lot of phone calls and break down the latest election news, economy news, second amendment news, you name it.
[01:08:43.564 --> 01:08:51.810]  We're going to start airing chunks of a almost hour-long, boil-down interview that I conducted two weeks ago with Louis Farrakhan.
[01:08:54.632 --> 01:08:56.134]  And we basically made a documentary out of it.
[01:08:56.234 --> 01:09:05.461]  And then, within the end of the hour, I will post the full video, so you can watch it in the end, at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:09:05.821 --> 01:09:12.126]  But I mused aloud yesterday, on Facebook Mention's live feed,
[01:09:16.627 --> 01:09:17.988]  How important is Louis Farrakhan?
[01:09:18.148 --> 01:09:26.413]  Well, globally and with black communities, he is the second most important living, quote, black person.
[01:09:27.013 --> 01:09:32.236]  I don't like saying it according to, you know, quote, supposed race, but, you know, that's, that's the perspective.
[01:09:33.417 --> 01:09:35.558]  Forget Michael Jackson, forget pop.
[01:09:35.598 --> 01:09:42.943]  I mean, when it comes to the real world, people that are politically or religiously involved, he is extremely influential around the world.
[01:09:45.157 --> 01:09:51.521]  And if you can get him talking about the New World Order, and talking about globalism, and talking about eugenics, something he already covers.
[01:09:51.981 --> 01:10:04.269]  But if you can force it out into the debate, and if you can point out that we're all under attack by the globalist technocracy that's meeting in Davos, Switzerland right now, it is a game changer.
[01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:09.012]  And by extension, and I'm going to go to your calls, this is what hit me.
[01:10:10.112 --> 01:10:12.334]  Obama is the most important political
[01:10:14.321 --> 01:10:15.262]  Black man in the world.
[01:10:16.363 --> 01:10:24.030]  And by extension, he is the most important man in the world when it comes to politics in the court of public opinion.
[01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:27.874]  There are powerful elites behind the scenes, but Obama is the figurehead.
[01:10:31.377 --> 01:10:35.081]  And with a supposed African figurehead of the West,
[01:10:36.667 --> 01:10:38.328]  We have seen black unemployment double.
[01:10:38.348 --> 01:10:44.393]  We've seen the Pentagon be able to invade all of Africa and bring in radical jihadis as their pretext to do it.
[01:10:45.014 --> 01:10:47.816]  We have seen radical Islamists take over the Middle East.
[01:10:48.076 --> 01:10:55.422]  They've now allowed them to invade Europe to then turn around and crush Africa and crush the Middle East as a response to what's been engineered.
[01:10:55.482 --> 01:11:00.226]  It's a giant, slow motion, mega false flag in front of everyone.
[01:11:01.867 --> 01:11:03.608]  And when I say mega, that means million.
[01:11:04.554 --> 01:11:08.936]  And you're talking about a million deaths in this Arab Spring by the time it's all done.
[01:11:08.956 --> 01:11:13.839]  I mean, it's hundreds of thousands in Syria, hundreds of thousands in North Africa.
[01:11:14.819 --> 01:11:23.984]  It is, places like Libya, it is millions dead, starting the destabilization in Iraq, the country that fought Al-Qaeda, the country that was archenemies of Saudi Arabia.
[01:11:27.145 --> 01:11:31.347]  See how they say attack Syriac because of ISIS when it's the West funding ISIS.
[01:11:31.887 --> 01:11:43.272]  But we've reached this wonderful moment where we've got Louis Farrakhan saying corrupt elements of the US government run ISIS and we've got Donald Trump saying the same thing.
[01:11:44.532 --> 01:11:53.676]  We've reached a moment, you're going to hear it, where Farrakhan says Donald Trump's right about blocking all Muslims because it's a bunch of terrorists being infiltrated to destabilize things.
[01:11:55.726 --> 01:12:09.510]  See, that's a game changer, because it flips everything on its head, and that's what you're going to see in a big populist movement, is it's about truth and what's really going on, and about real change, not about labels, not about what color your skin is.
[01:12:11.190 --> 01:12:11.770]  But it hit me.
[01:12:13.051 --> 01:12:15.091]  Obama wasn't real in his office.
[01:12:16.292 --> 01:12:18.332]  Obama squandered all the goodwill he had.
[01:12:18.392 --> 01:12:21.413]  By design, the globalists are about infighting and betrayal, not about honor.
[01:12:23.547 --> 01:12:25.768]  He destroyed an incredible legacy he could have had.
[01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:35.972]  To bring people together instead of creating giant chasms and wounds and rubbing salt in them.
[01:12:37.633 --> 01:12:40.814]  And so Obama is not the most important person in the world.
[01:12:41.634 --> 01:12:43.515]  Because he has just become a puppet.
[01:12:46.181 --> 01:12:47.382]  And he's not a black man.
[01:12:47.862 --> 01:12:48.862]  He's not a white man.
[01:12:49.803 --> 01:12:52.784]  He's a servant of the globalists that are anti-human.
[01:12:53.245 --> 01:12:57.046]  He's a man of death and sin and lies and fraud.
[01:13:01.549 --> 01:13:04.530]  His color is the color of the fires of Hades.
[01:13:06.931 --> 01:13:08.972]  And he has a kindred spirit.
[01:13:10.848 --> 01:13:17.573]  With the system of the world that he worships of ego and power trips and domination and control and lies.
[01:13:20.755 --> 01:13:27.019]  So then that would make Louis Farrakhan the most important black man in the world.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:33.984]  Because Barack Obama, in my view, isn't like any black person I've ever known.
[01:13:36.446 --> 01:13:37.247]  Now you think about that.
[01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:50.177]  So, that's why we went and did the interview with Farrakhan, that's why he gave us the interview, and that's why I'm pointing out that things like this, this seed, is the type of thing that will bring the globalists down.
[01:13:50.757 --> 01:14:02.703]  ISIS has complained and attacked InfoWars and its recruitment videos, and internal documents have come out where they tell their members, no, no, no, we don't work for the CIA, we don't work for the West, and that's the biggest thing impeding them
[01:14:04.178 --> 01:14:11.280]  And the biggest thing hurting their recruitment is they're learning that they're actually working against their own regions, their own religion, their own area.
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:15.681]  And it is InfoWars that is effectively damaging them.
[01:14:16.461 --> 01:14:16.961]  They said that.
[01:14:17.661 --> 01:14:21.462]  And Assad, three years ago it came out in London Independent, they hacked their emails.
[01:14:22.582 --> 01:14:28.604]  And there was Assad with the Russians and others saying, we're directing our information bureau
[01:14:29.764 --> 01:14:45.030]  Our propaganda bureau to go with the reports at Infowars.com and Alex Jones because they're the most accurate and our people don't understand geopolitics and so we've been advised to go with what Alex Jones is saying because that's the truth.
[01:14:46.770 --> 01:14:47.210]  You can look it up.
[01:14:49.691 --> 01:14:52.472]  And you notice it isn't just that it fit with what Assad wanted to put out.
[01:14:52.512 --> 01:14:54.113]  He's not perfect by any yardstick.
[01:14:54.273 --> 01:14:55.033]  He tried to reform.
[01:14:55.053 --> 01:14:57.294]  He got set up like Saddam or like Qaddafi.
[01:14:59.070 --> 01:15:01.912]  When you're surrounded by a bunch of al-Qaeda killers, you do some bad stuff to survive.
[01:15:01.952 --> 01:15:02.613]  I'm not defending it.
[01:15:04.074 --> 01:15:05.255]  But what comes into the vacuum?
[01:15:08.077 --> 01:15:16.463]  But you notice now what we said five years ago, four years ago, three years ago in the staged Syrian civil war is now coming out of the mouth of the former head of defense intelligence?
[01:15:17.765 --> 01:15:19.586]  It's coming out of the mouth of the head of Southcom.
[01:15:20.306 --> 01:15:24.228]  It's coming out of the mouth of Dempsey who left, the former chairman.
[01:15:24.649 --> 01:15:26.289]  It's coming out of the mouth of Donald Trump.
[01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:28.250]  It's coming out of the mouth of Ted Cruz.
[01:15:28.551 --> 01:15:30.131]  It's coming out of the mouth of Rand Paul.
[01:15:30.552 --> 01:15:32.112]  It's coming out of the mouth of Rush Limbaugh.
[01:15:32.573 --> 01:15:33.953]  It's coming out of the mouth of Glenn Beck.
[01:15:34.494 --> 01:15:37.195]  It's coming out of all their mouths and it came out of Infowars.
[01:15:37.535 --> 01:15:42.378]  And it came out of our guests, the CIA whistleblowers, the Navy SEALs, the Army officers.
[01:15:44.008 --> 01:15:50.530]  The Pentagon sources, the Colonel Schaffers, the Tosh Plumleys, and it's all dead-on accurate.
[01:15:50.810 --> 01:15:54.992]  And that's why people listen to us, because folks, we know how to sniff out the truth.
[01:15:55.352 --> 01:15:56.752]  We know the enemy game plan.
[01:15:57.112 --> 01:15:58.113]  We know how to stop it.
[01:15:58.433 --> 01:15:59.333]  We know how to fight it.
[01:16:00.563 --> 01:16:07.287]  And once you get in our mindset and see things through our optics, you go, whoa, why didn't I ever see that before?
[01:16:07.307 --> 01:16:08.748]  And I'm like, it's like the hidden picture.
[01:16:08.768 --> 01:16:11.189]  You look out on the wall, you know, it looks like a maze.
[01:16:11.509 --> 01:16:16.892]  And finally you see, you go, how did I ever see that's a pyramid or a cat or whatever it is, or a swan?
[01:16:18.673 --> 01:16:19.534]  How did I ever see that?
[01:16:19.594 --> 01:16:21.055]  Because once you click, it's there.
[01:16:21.415 --> 01:16:22.936]  And you go, Alex isn't that smart?
[01:16:23.296 --> 01:16:24.136]  He just saw it.
[01:16:24.196 --> 01:16:26.838]  He said there's a... Exactly.
[01:16:27.178 --> 01:16:28.679]  And when you cross that line,
[01:16:31.144 --> 01:16:32.204]  It's the beginning of knowledge.
[01:16:33.084 --> 01:16:36.705]  And let me warn you, though, with great wisdom, as the Bible says, comes great sorrow.
[01:16:39.386 --> 01:16:44.187]  But the sorrow is very filling and is very strong and is actually good.
[01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:55.030]  To feel the pain of humanity, to also feel its strength, its will, you have to own it all, take it on, and at first it's heavy and then it fills you.
[01:16:56.243 --> 01:17:04.568]  And then now you're with all your ancestors and everyone to come after us if we survive and you realize the great mission and the total goal and it's absolutely transcendent.
[01:17:11.431 --> 01:17:21.555]  And the great sorrow is how weak your flesh is, and that even though you've spiritually transcended the world, you're still in the world, you're still controlled by the world.
[01:17:22.216 --> 01:17:25.697]  If you're married and a beautiful woman walks by, that's God's creation.
[01:17:25.737 --> 01:17:26.858]  How do you not lust?
[01:17:27.718 --> 01:17:34.601]  And you know it's a betrayal of your wife, your children, but you still, even thinking it in your mind, you know it's not something that's good, but it happened.
[01:17:37.056 --> 01:17:39.697]  But the wicked ones, they don't have any feelings of remorse.
[01:17:40.037 --> 01:17:43.358]  They don't have... You know, King David, I'm going to skip this break and go to your calls.
[01:17:45.119 --> 01:17:46.659]  He was a man after God's own heart.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:52.582]  And not because he didn't send his best friend to be killed because he wanted his wife.
[01:17:53.462 --> 01:17:56.963]  Not because he didn't use evil schemes sometimes to defeat his enemies.
[01:17:57.663 --> 01:18:01.085]  But he was so real, so passionate, and overall wanted to do good, but
[01:18:02.987 --> 01:18:10.510]  He would still fall into darkness, but his heart was pointed at God and he would truly repent and truly try to change and grow.
[01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:14.932]  And that's what made David a man after God's own heart.
[01:18:24.055 --> 01:18:25.176]  It's all a trick, folks.
[01:18:25.456 --> 01:18:27.056]  It's all a big con game.
[01:18:27.636 --> 01:18:31.558]  The devil doesn't run anything but slaves that have been intimidated to serving.
[01:18:35.888 --> 01:18:39.809]  And I'll be honest with you, if they offer you life extension technology, they offer to keep your kids alive.
[01:18:42.028 --> 01:19:07.477]  All you gotta do is take this nanotech infusion, all you gotta do is take this brain chip, all you gotta do is swear allegiance to this, and buy into it, and give your free will, and punch this button, and we'll take your mind over with virtual reality, and we'll put you in the Matrix, and you will never be in pain again, and we promise you eternal life inside the machine, but you have to do it with free will, and you have to know that not everybody's gonna get this.
[01:19:08.237 --> 01:19:09.637]  We're gonna kill most of the people.
[01:19:10.057 --> 01:19:10.978]  Now take my hand.
[01:19:12.276 --> 01:19:12.997]  Take my hand.
[01:19:13.177 --> 01:19:13.717]  I'm God.
[01:19:13.897 --> 01:19:14.578]  I'm Lucifer.
[01:19:15.018 --> 01:19:15.659]  I'm Satan.
[01:19:16.019 --> 01:19:18.881]  Take my hand, and I will make you a god.
[01:19:18.901 --> 01:19:21.283]  I will deliver you into Valhalla.
[01:19:22.544 --> 01:19:23.965]  The battle of the gods is here.
[01:19:24.846 --> 01:19:26.987]  Choose who you see controls this world.
[01:19:27.347 --> 01:19:32.071]  Choose who you know in front of you is in control.
[01:19:32.171 --> 01:19:33.712]  Don't believe the Sky God.
[01:19:33.972 --> 01:19:36.875]  Believe the God of Microsoft and Apple.
[01:19:37.215 --> 01:19:39.777]  Believe the God that gives you the Apple.
[01:19:40.953 --> 01:19:45.994]  Take the knowledge, take the logic of this system, the dark logic.
[01:19:46.354 --> 01:19:47.215]  Join me.
[01:19:51.976 --> 01:19:55.717]  My enemies will take that clip and say, here is Alex Jones channeling the devil.
[01:19:56.797 --> 01:19:59.117]  Here's Alex Jones admitting he's the devil.
[01:19:59.177 --> 01:20:00.738]  That's how their dark logic works.
[01:20:00.978 --> 01:20:02.538]  That's how their deception works.
[01:20:02.778 --> 01:20:09.120]  They take someone illustrating for them what the system's doing, how it's operating.
[01:20:10.976 --> 01:20:18.222]  And won't decide to face that system and fight it and warn others and expose what's already here and what is going to be coming.
[01:20:19.283 --> 01:20:31.433]  They will instead make it about the orator that played the part for one minute just to give you an idea of what the establishment offers.
[01:20:35.396 --> 01:20:37.578]  I have been taken up to the high places.
[01:20:39.316 --> 01:20:41.117]  I have been offered the power.
[01:20:43.398 --> 01:20:45.079]  And not because I'm a prophet.
[01:20:45.379 --> 01:20:46.800]  Not because I'm a Christ.
[01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:47.640]  No, no.
[01:20:48.401 --> 01:20:49.341]  Every great man.
[01:20:50.422 --> 01:20:51.382]  Every great woman.
[01:20:52.543 --> 01:20:54.224]  Is taken up to the high places.
[01:20:55.904 --> 01:20:56.625]  Figuratively.
[01:20:57.925 --> 01:20:58.606]  But literally.
[01:20:59.566 --> 01:21:00.747]  In the high buildings.
[01:21:01.787 --> 01:21:02.988]  With the great men.
[01:21:03.728 --> 01:21:04.689]  With the perfect dress.
[01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:05.509]  The perfect smile.
[01:21:05.689 --> 01:21:06.270]  The charm.
[01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.990]  The whole world.
[01:21:07.190 --> 01:21:08.691]  Right out of the movie Devil's Advocate.
[01:21:10.146 --> 01:21:30.311]  All that can be yours, right now, these women, that penthouse, this $300,000 car, right now, security, people that'll take care of you, people that care about you, people that can fulfill you, not the dirty rabble in the street, who would tear you apart in a minute because you're made of greater stuff than they.
[01:21:30.691 --> 01:21:32.291]  You belong with the elite!
[01:21:33.052 --> 01:21:34.612]  You belong with the elect!
[01:21:35.412 --> 01:21:36.953]  You belong here!
[01:21:37.273 --> 01:21:37.973]  Join us!
[01:21:40.282 --> 01:21:42.963]  But your discernment lets you know it's a trap.
[01:21:44.504 --> 01:21:46.645]  And history shows you what happens.
[01:21:47.746 --> 01:21:51.048]  It's all fancily dressed slaves.
[01:21:52.328 --> 01:21:52.969]  Peacocks.
[01:21:53.769 --> 01:21:54.750]  Deathly empty.
[01:22:00.293 --> 01:22:04.675]  They say the ninth circle of hell in Dante's Inferno is a frozen wasteland.
[01:22:07.711 --> 01:22:11.733]  The allegories of hell are fire, torment, pain, and stench.
[01:22:13.534 --> 01:22:18.236]  But as you approach the center of hell, I agree with Dante's vision.
[01:22:19.096 --> 01:22:23.698]  It is a frozen, cold wasteland of no honor, no beauty, no will.
[01:22:25.099 --> 01:22:36.484]  Nothing but a stinking refuge of failed, twisted wisdom.
[01:22:38.254 --> 01:22:46.873]  That could not be God and creation and all the incredible things that the life giver has transmitted into the consciousness of reality.
[01:22:51.004 --> 01:22:56.748]  And so the devil lives in the twisted, the profane, the diseased, the fallen.
[01:22:56.988 --> 01:23:13.458]  It takes what God has made and cannot create, so only chops it up and rearranges it, like the deformed guinea pigs eating the GMO, with their testicles growing on the tops of their heads and legs sticking out their side, dragging huge tumors behind them.
[01:23:14.259 --> 01:23:16.060]  That's the artwork of the devil!
[01:23:20.034 --> 01:23:22.295]  You want me to sign on to something like that?
[01:23:26.416 --> 01:23:48.764]  In the street, in the poorest areas of the world, there is happiness, there is glee, there is enjoyment, there is kinship, there is friendship, there is passion, there is love, until the televisions get turned on, until the internet gets delivered, the UN, free internet, free microloans, so now the villagers can sit there
[01:23:50.173 --> 01:23:53.181]  And the young kids don't want to go work on the farm with dad and grandpa anymore.
[01:23:53.201 --> 01:23:54.845]  I don't care where they are in the world.
[01:23:55.246 --> 01:23:57.051]  Rural Texas or rural Africa.
[01:23:59.369 --> 01:24:08.255]  And they sit there and they see Kim Kardashian, and they see shows with yachts and cars and money and helicopters and glitz, and they didn't ever have that.
[01:24:08.655 --> 01:24:09.896]  All they had was this.
[01:24:10.596 --> 01:24:11.897]  All they had was their soul.
[01:24:11.957 --> 01:24:13.978]  All they had was the light in their eyes.
[01:24:14.318 --> 01:24:24.625]  And now they see this shining city on a hill, this wonderland, like all the little cheerleaders and drill team girls and beauty queens.
[01:24:25.345 --> 01:24:34.492]  That are going to be models and movie stars, and they show up in the dead zone of California, and all there is is the sex industry.
[01:24:37.134 --> 01:24:47.743]  And then you have your few movie parts and your modeling as the front for the rest of the stuff you do, and that itself isn't even the sin.
[01:24:49.599 --> 01:25:02.866]  The greater sin is that it was all a lie and that when that little moth took off from Kansas or New York or Florida or Oregon and flew into that bug zapper, it never knew what hit it.
[01:25:07.389 --> 01:25:16.534]  And I see women go off to California with that feminine power in their eyes and I see them come back with a sly look of a predator.
[01:25:18.038 --> 01:25:24.660]  Because once they're bitten by the vampires, they succumb to the sickness and become vampires in their own right.
[01:25:26.901 --> 01:25:32.923]  There can be black vampires, white vampires, Asiatic vampires.
[01:25:32.963 --> 01:25:35.664]  There's vampires of every, quote, race.
[01:25:39.865 --> 01:25:43.306]  And they can't get blood out of other vampires.
[01:25:44.847 --> 01:25:48.832]  The great age of the vampire parasite is upon us.
[01:25:55.119 --> 01:25:58.582]  The devil's 15 minutes of fame are just about here.
[01:26:00.404 --> 01:26:05.971]  And it's gonna be a rage-driven, foaming-at-the-mouth looting.
[01:26:07.236 --> 01:26:10.718]  The likes of which this world has never seen.
[01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:12.479]  The insanity.
[01:26:12.779 --> 01:26:14.240]  The hundreds of millions killed.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:16.041]  The genetic engineering.
[01:26:16.361 --> 01:26:17.822]  The vandalism of the planet.
[01:26:18.922 --> 01:26:19.403]  All of it.
[01:26:19.463 --> 01:26:20.723]  The hydrogen bombs.
[01:26:21.124 --> 01:26:22.144]  The super weapons.
[01:26:22.404 --> 01:26:23.445]  The cyclotrons.
[01:26:23.705 --> 01:26:25.026]  The leaking reactors.
[01:26:26.006 --> 01:26:27.007]  All by design.
[01:26:27.827 --> 01:26:29.028]  All part of the sickness.
[01:26:29.808 --> 01:26:33.030]  All part of the breaking of the dam.
[01:26:33.130 --> 01:26:36.432]  The falling of the gates as hell rushes in.
[01:26:44.025 --> 01:26:47.966]  Alright, let's go to Owen, formerly in whatever state he's in.
[01:26:48.007 --> 01:26:48.787]  He's in FEMA Region 7.
[01:26:49.127 --> 01:26:49.747]  Think about that.
[01:26:50.047 --> 01:26:51.408]  The feds don't even see it as their states.
[01:26:51.648 --> 01:26:53.429]  They say that in the Defense Authorization Acts.
[01:26:54.769 --> 01:26:56.310]  It's just everything is so over the top.
[01:26:56.610 --> 01:26:59.311]  Of course we're under FEMA Region 7 or 6 where I live.
[01:26:59.651 --> 01:27:02.972]  I mean, they got farms everywhere with humanoids growing in cows.
[01:27:02.992 --> 01:27:04.433]  I mean, you know, that's all you need to know.
[01:27:04.493 --> 01:27:05.133]  We're screwed!
[01:27:06.153 --> 01:27:10.315]  But admitting we're in this position is the beginning of getting out of it.
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:16.021]  I've seen people when bullies are beating them up, they'll just want to fight back, they'll lay there.
[01:27:16.041 --> 01:27:26.284]  And then sometimes you'll see somebody finally fight back and just explode with energy and stomp the bullies under the ground and... You just realize we're in that position.
[01:27:27.184 --> 01:27:37.028]  We've got this little demon sitting on us, oozing pus all over us with little yellow eyes, little buck teeth, you know, telling us how powerful it is.
[01:27:37.048 --> 01:27:39.808]  It's dressed up in a little tuxedo and I just want to strangle it.
[01:27:39.828 --> 01:27:40.409]  I mean, I'm done.
[01:27:40.429 --> 01:27:41.669]  I'm done.
[01:27:43.837 --> 01:27:46.118]  I mean, what type of God does this to people?
[01:27:46.599 --> 01:27:48.540]  The God of this world is no God at all.
[01:27:52.562 --> 01:27:57.165]  It hates us because we look like the Creator, like Genesis says.
[01:27:58.766 --> 01:27:59.326]  In that image.
[01:28:01.507 --> 01:28:05.430]  This entity doesn't like us because we're better than the devil.
[01:28:06.150 --> 01:28:08.932]  The devil's just been around for a trillion years.
[01:28:14.045 --> 01:28:20.768]  He's an old man that knows all the tricks, taking a two-year-old out to the edge of a cliff and saying, you got wings, jump off, you can fly!
[01:28:25.831 --> 01:28:27.372]  Owen, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:28:29.192 --> 01:28:38.457]  Well, Alex, thank you for that preface leading into my call, and I think that anybody who agrees with you and feels that way, it's time for us to mobilize, and I think you would agree
[01:28:39.258 --> 01:28:52.121]  And I know you come on and you try to wake people up, and it's really just a matter of time before everybody is woken up, but we don't really have time anymore, and I think there's a way that we can start to mobilize through your show and through your products.
[01:28:52.901 --> 01:28:53.881]  I bought a lot of products from you.
[01:28:53.901 --> 01:28:54.422]  They're all great.
[01:28:54.442 --> 01:29:00.683]  I'd be happy to give you a review, but you give out bumper stickers with all of your products, and they're great bumper stickers.
[01:29:00.703 --> 01:29:08.705]  They're attention-getters, and you can place them all around town, but I think maybe you should create a new bumper sticker, custom-made,
[01:29:09.589 --> 01:29:12.230]  Um, that's just a square, not like the long ones you make.
[01:29:12.971 --> 01:29:34.681]  And anybody who agrees with what you just said, anybody who's done living in the false reality, who's done living in the false paradigm, and who wants to survive the hell that's going to be unleashed on this country when they decide to burst all these economic bubbles, when they decide to shut down the power grid, whatever it is that's going to happen, it's time for everybody to, instead of take the market- Stand there, I agree with you.
[01:29:35.641 --> 01:29:36.222]  We need this.
[01:29:36.942 --> 01:29:38.643]  A bunch of different stickers that say it all.
[01:29:39.404 --> 01:29:41.725]  A human with a club smashing a television.
[01:29:42.105 --> 01:29:44.867]  A human with a club smashing an Illuminati pyramid.
[01:29:45.207 --> 01:29:46.828]  A human with a club smashing a robot.
[01:29:47.229 --> 01:29:50.651]  And it doesn't mean, and it says Infowars.com under it, it doesn't mean you're against technology.
[01:29:50.951 --> 01:29:57.575]  You're against the robots being unleashed to take over working for the elite to checkmate human will.
[01:29:58.136 --> 01:29:59.036]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.516 --> 01:30:01.137]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.038 --> 01:30:04.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.949 --> 01:30:22.913]  The Intelligence Community's Inspector General has just revealed to lawmakers that Hillary Clinton had classified documents above Top Secret on her private email server, in addition to over 1,300 other classified emails.
[01:30:23.333 --> 01:30:32.296]  Access to information in the Special Access Program is more highly restricted, more sensitive than Top Secret, because it would likely reveal the source, putting lives at risk.
[01:30:32.876 --> 01:30:39.939]  We're constantly told that our money, our rule of law, our liberties must all be sacrificed on the altar of national security.
[01:30:40.099 --> 01:30:45.161]  Hillary has violated the surveillance state's religion, and she needs to be burned at the stake.
[01:30:45.601 --> 01:30:47.442]  Orange is the new pantsuit, Hillary.
[01:30:47.682 --> 01:30:54.585]  But she's being investigated by Obama's Justice Department, and she has about as much chance of going to jail as a Chicago cop.
[01:30:54.825 --> 01:31:00.388]  If she gets away with these crimes, the fraud of the surveillance state will be inescapably obvious to all.
[01:31:05.094 --> 01:31:06.956]  For more information, go to InfoWars.com.
[01:31:07.056 --> 01:31:08.036]  I'm David Knight.
[01:31:08.697 --> 01:31:11.659]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[01:32:06.861 --> 01:32:11.642]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:32:11.942 --> 01:32:16.763]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:32:16.843 --> 01:32:17.243]  We're good.
[01:32:38.442 --> 01:32:39.222]  Shower Filters.
[01:32:39.363 --> 01:32:40.963]  We're introducing the best yet.
[01:32:41.083 --> 01:32:45.005]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.

[01:33:18.979 --> 01:33:21.141]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:21.662 --> 01:33:26.808]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:31.853 --> 01:33:33.194]  Alright, here's what's gonna happen.
[01:33:34.341 --> 01:33:36.842]  We've still got two and a half hours of transmission left.
[01:33:36.862 --> 01:33:38.904]  I'm going to keep going to your calls.
[01:33:38.924 --> 01:33:43.106]  Then I'm going to start airing some of the sneak peeks of the interview with Farrakhan.
[01:33:43.126 --> 01:33:48.689]  And then we're going to start next hour airing large chunks of it right into the next with David Knight hosting.
[01:33:49.489 --> 01:33:51.510]  We've got a lot of other news that's going to be breaking down at that time.
[01:33:53.451 --> 01:33:56.253]  But what we're seeing right now is evil come out of the closet.
[01:33:57.414 --> 01:33:57.534]  And
[01:33:58.863 --> 01:34:01.807]  It's really good at getting us to choose fake sides.
[01:34:02.628 --> 01:34:09.278]  It's really good at making everything look like it's male against female, or vice versa, or black against white, or vice versa.
[01:34:09.818 --> 01:34:14.225]  And then, when they set up these political collisions, it's real, what's happening.
[01:34:14.565 --> 01:34:15.426]  It's manipulated.
[01:34:16.636 --> 01:34:32.924]  But nevertheless, you know, tens of millions of immigrants, unskilled, coming from China and Latin America and places, is creating a Tower of Babel, where we're all infighting, with the Democrats and Republicans in there, playing both sides off against each other for balkanization.
[01:34:34.805 --> 01:34:44.230]  So, even though I want to stop the third world from being dumbed down, poisoned, at the same time, I have to then defend myself, because the globalists are using the third world as a weapon.
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:51.642]  They play all the different points off against each other because they're tax-exempt and have diplomatic immunity and are basically above the law.
[01:34:53.022 --> 01:34:55.823]  Except when the power structure burns one of its own occasionally.
[01:34:57.024 --> 01:34:58.884]  They have a rigged casino.
[01:35:00.045 --> 01:35:05.486]  And more and more we have to psychologically, spiritually, mentally come out of the Babylon system.
[01:35:06.387 --> 01:35:07.667]  We're in the world, not of it.
[01:35:08.922 --> 01:35:12.444]  And that doesn't mean that you don't see a movie or you don't listen to whatever.
[01:35:12.745 --> 01:35:13.625]  I'm not a Pharisee.
[01:35:13.705 --> 01:35:14.526]  I'm not a hypocrite.
[01:35:14.846 --> 01:35:22.091]  I'm not one of these churchgoers, you know, that if they hear a cuss word, you know, call the police, but aren't doing anything to fight tyranny.
[01:35:23.211 --> 01:35:24.372]  And I'm not judging them either.
[01:35:27.294 --> 01:35:29.455]  But, you know, God uses all different types of people.
[01:35:30.116 --> 01:35:37.621]  And I'll say it, I'm an aggressive, alpha male, you know, classic, somewhat piratical in my youth.
[01:35:39.315 --> 01:35:40.717]  And, you know, the real deal.
[01:35:41.418 --> 01:35:45.744]  Vicious, aggressive, smart, mean, sexual creature.
[01:35:49.409 --> 01:35:50.971]  Because that's part of the human nature.
[01:35:51.111 --> 01:35:53.995]  But my good nature, my high nature,
[01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:58.522]  is just as extreme or more so as my bad side.
[01:35:59.222 --> 01:36:01.463]  And everything is about an artificial construct.
[01:36:01.663 --> 01:36:07.046]  Everything is about putting you into a soft, fake world so you never have to face real crisis.
[01:36:07.366 --> 01:36:09.508]  So you never have to face real danger.
[01:36:09.748 --> 01:36:14.390]  So you never have to learn to succeed and count on yourself and others around you.
[01:36:14.871 --> 01:36:22.715]  It's about atomizing us into desperate individuals who have no friends or family, who collectively join with the state
[01:36:24.764 --> 01:36:25.465]  And are absorbed.
[01:36:27.446 --> 01:36:28.367]  This is a cult.
[01:36:29.888 --> 01:36:31.609]  A globalist power cult.
[01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:40.935]  That even if the devil is not a real entity, we have a physical group consciousness manifestation of it.
[01:36:41.756 --> 01:36:49.882]  So it's real, as I've said a thousand times, any way you look at it, any way you dissect it from any angle,
[01:36:52.878 --> 01:36:54.879]  That's why they tell you, oh, there's no free will.
[01:36:55.379 --> 01:36:56.980]  Oh, you're just a bunch of electrons.
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:00.002]  Oh, you're just a, you know, a clock that's wound up and starts.
[01:37:00.622 --> 01:37:03.023]  Oh, you don't, because they all know you have free will.
[01:37:03.283 --> 01:37:06.245]  They want you to give up your free will and decide there's no point.
[01:37:06.845 --> 01:37:12.208]  That's the spirit of the world, is just an apathy and just, I'm not worried about dying.
[01:37:12.528 --> 01:37:13.749]  I'll just party all I want.
[01:37:13.789 --> 01:37:15.369]  I'll just commit suicide when the time comes.
[01:37:15.389 --> 01:37:20.052]  You know, that's in the culture, or I don't care about my kids, or I don't care about what's happening.
[01:37:21.411 --> 01:37:37.035]  You know, India has some of the highest IQ people in the world, but for thousands of years, the social structure engineers came in and taught people dogmas of row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.
[01:37:37.055 --> 01:37:41.116]  And I've been told that repeatedly by wealthy, prominent Indians.
[01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:44.425]  And they'll defend the caste system to you.
[01:37:44.985 --> 01:37:47.448]  They will tell you that the people don't want to be free.
[01:37:48.128 --> 01:37:49.149]  They will sit there and go, yeah.
[01:37:49.190 --> 01:37:50.851]  And I said, well, why can't India be free?
[01:37:51.652 --> 01:37:57.117]  Why can't India, if they're so smart, there's a billion plus of them, ever, you know, develop itself properly?
[01:37:57.157 --> 01:38:01.381]  And he says, row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, last but a dream.
[01:38:02.302 --> 01:38:02.763]  Just don't care.
[01:38:04.326 --> 01:38:06.888]  So smart, you learn to just turn it off and not care.
[01:38:07.209 --> 01:38:13.094]  So smart, you just turn it off and decide not to transcend the squalor and the corruption and the tyranny.
[01:38:13.394 --> 01:38:20.621]  You just decide to accept it and tune your brain with ancient, basically, mind control to not care.
[01:38:21.742 --> 01:38:26.867]  That is delusion and that is a spell that is on India.
[01:38:28.203 --> 01:38:35.327]  What we called spells thousands of years ago is nothing but a program, a template, a spirit.
[01:38:36.087 --> 01:38:37.988]  Because we broadcast in the sixth sense.
[01:38:38.028 --> 01:38:43.691]  It's been proven that there is a broadcast from our huge electrochemical, you know, billions of cells.
[01:38:44.291 --> 01:38:45.792]  Billions and billions of cells in our brain.
[01:38:46.032 --> 01:38:46.952]  They're all electrochemical.
[01:38:46.972 --> 01:38:48.033]  They're broadcasting.
[01:38:48.073 --> 01:38:48.653]  It's been proven.
[01:38:48.793 --> 01:38:50.354]  That's why you feel someone looking at you.
[01:38:50.414 --> 01:38:51.815]  It's why that's out there.
[01:38:52.634 --> 01:38:57.036]  Charlton's then come and claim they have more of it or can control it and then that's where the con artistry begins.
[01:38:57.076 --> 01:38:58.917]  But everybody knows there's a sixth sense.
[01:38:59.777 --> 01:39:00.618]  Science knows it.
[01:39:03.819 --> 01:39:05.260]  And they want to block that out.
[01:39:07.096 --> 01:39:13.421]  Or they want to get enough people being delusional and enough people buying into something to where it becomes a great mass delusion.
[01:39:13.661 --> 01:39:16.344]  Police and governments have always studied mob psychology.
[01:39:17.124 --> 01:39:22.248]  Why do people who are even super smart go into any mode you can imagine under mob psychology?
[01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:24.030]  Nighttime rallies with fire.
[01:39:24.050 --> 01:39:25.271]  You know, Hitler did that.
[01:39:25.351 --> 01:39:27.513]  Or mass chanting.
[01:39:30.307 --> 01:39:32.588]  It's just ancient mind control technology, folks.
[01:39:33.449 --> 01:39:42.955]  And then once you get, see, but the added secret they won't tell you is they're trying to get enough people broadcasting, like a pep rally at the school.
[01:39:43.175 --> 01:39:45.217]  A pep rally isn't about football.
[01:39:45.577 --> 01:39:59.826]  It's about loving the school, it being your cult, it being your culture, it being your tribe, it being your God, not your ancestors, not Christ, not where you came from, not your liberty, not your freedom, not meeting around the fire with the elders,
[01:40:00.186 --> 01:40:10.100]  Not transmitting knowledge by verbal generational experience and activating genetic memories.
[01:40:11.883 --> 01:40:15.007]  No, you go and yell and scream and face paint and everyone feels good and goes
[01:40:16.890 --> 01:40:30.801]  With simulated war to turn the young men into egomaniacs to make sure that they never learn to be in war in business or life or culture or to be successful in real leaders like they would have learned around a campfire.
[01:40:33.784 --> 01:40:36.226]  No, they learn how to strut around and run with a ball.
[01:40:37.327 --> 01:40:39.869]  To make sure that's what men do, they run around with a ball.
[01:40:40.709 --> 01:40:42.671]  And other men watch that because that's what men do.
[01:40:42.871 --> 01:40:43.912]  You see the programming?
[01:40:44.272 --> 01:40:46.094]  Now you think football's okay to watch?
[01:40:51.861 --> 01:40:59.123]  Men that would have been something are now never even alive, never even conscious, never even lived.
[01:41:01.744 --> 01:41:02.564]  They're stunted.
[01:41:02.785 --> 01:41:03.645]  They're arrested.
[01:41:03.725 --> 01:41:04.505]  They're gone.
[01:41:07.206 --> 01:41:11.067]  They're acting like five-year-olds when they imagine they're superheroes.
[01:41:11.647 --> 01:41:14.668]  I've gone and seen Marvel movies.
[01:41:14.728 --> 01:41:16.289]  Most of them are dumb on purpose.
[01:41:16.429 --> 01:41:19.090]  They're getting so stupid it's insane for international audiences.
[01:41:20.003 --> 01:41:23.626]  They're dumbing the culture down and I see grown men, I see military people.
[01:41:24.147 --> 01:41:35.477]  I have sat there and watched decorated combat troops salivate during things like the Avengers.
[01:41:36.057 --> 01:41:39.300]  That is the most mindless crap the planet ever produced.
[01:41:41.062 --> 01:41:44.225]  And act like I acted when I was five years old.
[01:41:47.679 --> 01:41:51.307]  Meanwhile, there's a real war going on against humanity.
[01:41:52.289 --> 01:41:53.031]  It's declared.
[01:41:53.051 --> 01:41:55.015]  It's open.
[01:41:55.035 --> 01:41:58.603]  It's brazen.
[01:42:05.256 --> 01:42:08.097]  And of course only generals and foreign leaders listen to the show.
[01:42:08.738 --> 01:42:16.982]  I mean, that's really where our audience is, is with the intelligentsia, because they can't turn on the TV or radio and hear anything like this, that they live, that they know.
[01:42:17.402 --> 01:42:20.604]  And that's the big secret of this show, folks, the powerful listen.
[01:42:21.084 --> 01:42:22.985]  Because let me tell you something, folks.
[01:42:24.086 --> 01:42:25.226]  I know what's going on.
[01:42:27.067 --> 01:42:28.348]  I know what goes on in their halls.
[01:42:29.128 --> 01:42:30.149]  I know what their fears are.
[01:42:36.169 --> 01:42:37.670]  I know what their plan is.
[01:42:40.012 --> 01:42:41.173]  And that's what this comes down to.
[01:42:41.293 --> 01:42:42.935]  All of you that serve the system, fools.
[01:42:43.976 --> 01:42:44.896]  Stop being idiots.
[01:42:45.357 --> 01:42:50.861]  Stop lying to yourself and telling yourself that this is all not true or that none of this is happening.
[01:42:50.901 --> 01:42:51.982]  It's all being admitted.
[01:42:52.703 --> 01:42:54.184]  You are under attack.
[01:42:54.204 --> 01:42:56.146]  You're not part of the ruling system.
[01:42:57.427 --> 01:43:00.889]  The truth is, even the top globalists are in fear.
[01:43:02.102 --> 01:43:07.245]  And at that level, just basically join with this planet killing spirit.
[01:43:10.987 --> 01:43:12.267]  They're undead spiritually.
[01:43:13.168 --> 01:43:14.048]  They're turned over.
[01:43:18.730 --> 01:43:19.691]  No one escapes it.
[01:43:21.452 --> 01:43:23.513]  No one joins with it and comes out on top.
[01:43:23.873 --> 01:43:24.413]  You lose.
[01:43:25.674 --> 01:43:27.415]  You join with this, you lose.
[01:43:28.595 --> 01:43:30.176]  You go along with this, you lose.
[01:43:30.576 --> 01:43:31.397]  And it's so good
[01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:44.548]  To not care if my hair is falling out, to not care if I got a zit on my face, to not care what people think about me, it's so empowering to be above the mind control.
[01:43:45.779 --> 01:43:47.820]  But it's also painful to see people caught in it.
[01:43:48.641 --> 01:43:50.162]  And still, I'll wear nice clothes.
[01:43:50.242 --> 01:43:51.043]  I'll wear a watch.
[01:43:51.243 --> 01:44:02.290]  If those trappings get mainstream people to watch, and make it look more establishment, and have a nice background for you to present the info, a nice package, what matters is what's inside.
[01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.910]  I'm going to your calls.
[01:44:02.930 --> 01:44:03.571]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:44:03.591 --> 01:44:04.552]  I've been really bad today.
[01:44:05.892 --> 01:44:08.554]  But I think it's been important information we've been talking about.
[01:44:08.774 --> 01:44:13.658]  Owen in FEMA Region 7, finish your point, and then we're going to go to Rashid, Mike, Liberty, Peter, and others.
[01:44:13.678 --> 01:44:14.278]  I apologize.
[01:44:14.298 --> 01:44:15.279]  Then to the Ferricon interview.
[01:44:15.299 --> 01:44:15.599]  Here it is.
[01:44:17.881 --> 01:44:18.762]  Go ahead, Owen.
[01:44:19.963 --> 01:44:26.069]  Well, Alex, anybody who recognizes the war on humanity is going on needs to mobilize, digitize, and start exercising their rights.
[01:44:26.150 --> 01:44:31.535]  And I think through your products and your creativeness, we can... See, you've already done phase one.
[01:44:31.575 --> 01:44:32.676]  It has to be done in phases.
[01:44:32.696 --> 01:44:39.183]  You created a mass media platform for truth and liberty where lost souls have gone to really just
[01:44:39.872 --> 01:44:40.533]  I don't think so.
[01:44:56.653 --> 01:45:08.757]  And so, info wars where you see me being attacked everywhere and the war going on around the rabbit hole entrance, people get that's not me failing, that's us winning as we go in, that of course the enemy is attacking.
[01:45:08.797 --> 01:45:09.598]  That's what we expect.
[01:45:09.838 --> 01:45:10.738]  That's part of the victory.
[01:45:12.389 --> 01:45:23.835]  So I think the next phase is for all the people who have broken free of the psychological jail cell that has been created by all these indoctrinating industries need to start connecting.
[01:45:24.075 --> 01:45:33.440]  And what we can do is you create a new bumper sticker, just a little square, and you either put it on your car or you put it on the wind door, the storm door of your house.
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:46.668]  And when you see that on other people's cars, other people's houses, you talk to them, you communicate them, and then you can create a new group, a new kinship that can start to mobilize politically.
[01:45:46.948 --> 01:45:56.674]  I spent ten minutes the other day on the phone and online, I signed two petitions to return states' rights to the state of Missouri, and I called three politicians.
[01:45:57.330 --> 01:46:00.331]  And I got through to each one of their offices and they heard my voice.
[01:46:00.651 --> 01:46:07.593]  If we could get everybody who agrees with this to mobilize... I agree, but also contact the general public.
[01:46:07.613 --> 01:46:10.174]  They're just as important as the Congress folks.
[01:46:10.554 --> 01:46:12.115]  And let the public know they're important.
[01:46:12.135 --> 01:46:14.055]  Let them know they can get activated.
[01:46:14.335 --> 01:46:16.456]  And just stop buying the system's products.
[01:46:16.756 --> 01:46:17.997]  Start speaking out against it.
[01:46:18.457 --> 01:46:19.057]  Absolutely.
[01:46:19.097 --> 01:46:19.597]  God bless you.
[01:46:19.617 --> 01:46:20.237]  It's a great idea.
[01:46:20.277 --> 01:46:21.718]  I do want to come out with a whole flotilla.
[01:46:22.438 --> 01:46:22.918]  I don't
[01:46:43.174 --> 01:46:44.154]  You're absolutely right.
[01:47:01.368 --> 01:47:02.929]  By just my gut, my spirit.
[01:47:03.970 --> 01:47:05.832]  And of course the news, history, information.
[01:47:06.012 --> 01:47:08.154]  And I can see now everything we've done.
[01:47:08.174 --> 01:47:12.958]  I'll be, I'll feel like I need to do something and then I build it and it doesn't do what I thought it did.
[01:47:13.078 --> 01:47:14.799]  It does four or five other things even better.
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:23.787]  And then right as we finish some new platform, the enemy attacks and damages or destroys another and then all of a sudden just doors go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:47:23.807 --> 01:47:26.229]  It's like Providence and just all the support floods in.
[01:47:26.809 --> 01:47:28.691]  I mean it's just incredible.
[01:47:28.791 --> 01:47:29.632]  It's epic and
[01:47:34.984 --> 01:47:36.405]  Man, I tell you what's scary.
[01:47:36.445 --> 01:47:39.086]  I tell you what scares me is people that don't know what's going on.
[01:47:39.227 --> 01:47:40.547]  I just, I get the willies.
[01:47:41.288 --> 01:47:51.233]  I get chills up and down my spine when I think about people that don't know what's going on and are spiritually blind that are getting chewed up, man.
[01:47:52.034 --> 01:47:55.876]  They are getting chewed up hard and they just have no idea what's all over them.
[01:47:56.136 --> 01:47:56.236]  And
[01:47:58.993 --> 01:48:01.554]  But it's the animating contest.
[01:48:01.634 --> 01:48:02.594]  It's the great experiment.
[01:48:02.634 --> 01:48:03.554]  It's the great battle.
[01:48:03.614 --> 01:48:04.174]  It's free will.
[01:48:04.234 --> 01:48:05.695]  It's being free will creatures.
[01:48:07.075 --> 01:48:09.195]  And it's a great contest.
[01:48:09.275 --> 01:48:10.696]  And it'll make us who we become.
[01:48:11.836 --> 01:48:12.576]  We are children.
[01:48:13.256 --> 01:48:15.377]  This plane of existence is a boot camp.
[01:48:15.817 --> 01:48:16.517]  It is a test.
[01:48:16.597 --> 01:48:17.277]  It is a drill.
[01:48:18.058 --> 01:48:20.398]  It is the big enchilada.
[01:48:21.218 --> 01:48:27.800]  And then past this, eyes not seen, ears not heard, the mind is not imagined, what God's got in store for us.
[01:48:30.361 --> 01:48:32.902]  I think I can imagine a little bit, because I can already pick it up.
[01:48:33.502 --> 01:48:36.543]  And I can just see the path of humanity, and it's spectacular.
[01:48:37.423 --> 01:48:38.803]  Absolutely spectacular.
[01:48:39.624 --> 01:48:41.004]  Just makes me love God so much.
[01:48:41.024 --> 01:48:42.844]  I can just feel the goodness of God.
[01:48:43.485 --> 01:48:44.925]  The strength.
[01:48:46.285 --> 01:48:50.446]  Just the endless will to create and build.
[01:48:51.867 --> 01:48:52.467]  It's amazing.
[01:48:52.687 --> 01:48:54.107]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:48:54.187 --> 01:48:55.447]  Liberty Monk in New Hampshire.
[01:48:55.467 --> 01:48:56.308]  Thanks for holding.
[01:48:56.328 --> 01:48:56.908]  We'll go to Peter.
[01:48:56.988 --> 01:48:57.268]  Go ahead.
[01:48:59.881 --> 01:49:01.522]  Why are people on the demo?
[01:49:01.542 --> 01:49:03.523]  The demo!
[01:49:20.018 --> 01:49:21.260]  Alex, I do agree with you.
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:27.028]  Humanity became slaves, devils slaves, basically.
[01:49:27.649 --> 01:49:28.911]  You can't deny it anymore.
[01:49:29.211 --> 01:49:35.159]  Because when you see what's happening, what they're playing for our kids on television, on Cartoon Network.
[01:49:35.876 --> 01:49:37.797]  Satanic cartoons.
[01:49:38.077 --> 01:49:39.757]  And it's not just satanic, okay?
[01:49:40.137 --> 01:49:45.399]  You know, the thing with sexy cheerleaders with devil horns was to hook earlier people with something, you know, wholesome.
[01:49:45.419 --> 01:49:46.179]  At least it's a woman.
[01:49:46.679 --> 01:49:55.961]  Now it's just diseased creatures walking around pooping on themselves and saying mindless things to literally scramble the wiring of children's brains and they admit that.
[01:49:57.822 --> 01:50:02.183]  They're trying to make water out of people's brains, basically, and they're doing a pretty good job with it.
[01:50:03.015 --> 01:50:10.717]  Also, I do agree with previous callers talking about, you know, waking up other people with your radio show and stuff like that.
[01:50:10.897 --> 01:50:12.037]  Now let me tell you my story.
[01:50:12.997 --> 01:50:20.039]  I'm posting on Craigslist all over the states messages to wake up America, wake up Americans.
[01:50:20.379 --> 01:50:20.539]  Good.
[01:50:20.619 --> 01:50:26.161]  And I also include your website, your radio show and stuff like that.
[01:50:26.201 --> 01:50:31.862]  Right before whatever happened in California with those terrorists, TSA wasn't
[01:50:32.552 --> 01:50:37.875]  Looking at those people, what they're doing, because they're too busy removing my posts out of Craigslist.
[01:50:38.726 --> 01:50:45.367]  Anything to do with your show that's being posted online, at least for me, disappears within one day.
[01:50:45.747 --> 01:50:46.048]  Okay?
[01:50:46.588 --> 01:50:49.168]  50 posts are gone within one click.
[01:50:49.308 --> 01:50:53.049]  I know, and that shows you that's because our info is powerful and dangerous to the globalists.
[01:50:53.409 --> 01:50:58.410]  That's why you have to redouble and hammer them, and just redouble everything you're doing.
[01:50:58.450 --> 01:50:59.650]  Keep it up, God bless you.
[01:51:00.251 --> 01:51:05.632]  Uh, Rashid, Mike, others, your calls are coming up, and then the big Louis Faircon interview, I promise I'm getting to it, next hour.
[01:51:05.672 --> 01:51:07.092]  We're gonna play a promo clip coming up.
[01:51:08.908 --> 01:51:11.649]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:51:11.969 --> 01:51:14.570]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:51:14.590 --> 01:51:15.010]  Croix River.
[01:51:15.330 --> 01:51:17.331]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:51:17.571 --> 01:51:20.291]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:51:20.532 --> 01:51:21.052]  His excuse?
[01:51:21.412 --> 01:51:22.472]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:51:22.732 --> 01:51:24.033]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:51:24.353 --> 01:51:29.854]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[01:51:30.094 --> 01:51:30.835]  Don't wait.
[01:51:31.135 --> 01:51:33.515]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now.

[01:51:38.777 --> 01:51:41.898]  Why be held hostage by your wireless carrier for two years?
[01:51:42.138 --> 01:51:48.900]  What if you had no contract, no activation fees, no hidden costs, tracking, tracing, harvesting customer data, or draconian gimmicks?
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:51.401]  All on the nation's best 4G LTE network.

[01:53:37.777 --> 01:53:38.537]  Shower Filters.
[01:53:38.677 --> 01:53:40.278]  We're introducing the best yet.
[01:53:40.398 --> 01:53:44.320]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.

[01:54:27.450 --> 01:54:30.212]  Absolutely big news, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:31.093 --> 01:54:44.022]  Fast and Furious, the government gun-running program that Obama launched the first year he got in office, to be blamed on American gun owners shipping guns down there to then have them kill people and then be blamed on the Second Amendment.
[01:54:44.223 --> 01:54:46.804]  That came out in the CBS News report that it was a false flag.
[01:54:47.405 --> 01:54:52.569]  El Chapo had a .50 caliber rifle that can take down a Learjet or a helicopter.
[01:54:53.769 --> 01:54:55.810]  And they're not giving out the serial number of it.
[01:54:55.850 --> 01:54:57.411]  Boy, talk about blowing up in their face.
[01:54:58.051 --> 01:55:03.573]  A .50 caliber is a massive rifle that can stop a car, and if it was intended, take down a helicopter.
[01:55:04.214 --> 01:55:06.775]  And of course, this has been out from Fox News this morning.
[01:55:06.815 --> 01:55:07.595]  I should have covered it.
[01:55:08.476 --> 01:55:10.897]  It's because this is the type of stuff that can bring these people down.
[01:55:11.437 --> 01:55:18.360]  If it doesn't bring them down, I mean, just the example of that, what else does it take?
[01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:21.802]  Meanwhile, Lynch defends Obama's gun actions.
[01:55:21.842 --> 01:55:22.542]  The Attorney General.
[01:55:26.089 --> 01:55:29.001]  She lists the tragedies and says that they're allowed to use executive power.
[01:55:29.603 --> 01:55:30.205]  Oh, really?
[01:55:30.366 --> 01:55:31.912]  Outside of law, just because you said so?
[01:55:34.403 --> 01:55:37.164]  Stocks trim losses, S&P still at lowest since 2014.
[01:55:37.204 --> 01:55:38.525]  We're going to be getting to all that.
[01:55:38.545 --> 01:55:41.266]  I'm going to take a few more of your calls, and then we're going to start airing the Farrakhan interview.
[01:55:41.706 --> 01:55:45.808]  And the big 50-minute boil-down will go up in the next hour or less to Infowars.com.
[01:55:46.068 --> 01:55:56.233]  Then the full two-plus hour, unredacted, it's the full interview, but it's been augmented, had a lot of clips added, will also go up as well to Infowars.com in the same post.
[01:55:57.571 --> 01:56:00.592]  But right now I want to play one of these promo clips of what's coming up.
[01:56:01.432 --> 01:56:03.873]  This is where Louis Farrakhan dares people.
[01:56:03.913 --> 01:56:07.274]  Then I'm going to get to the Louis Farrakhan exposes the real white devil.
[01:56:07.914 --> 01:56:10.955]  So this is Louis Farrakhan daring the mainstream media to do their job.
[01:56:13.395 --> 01:56:15.656]  This is the big picture.
[01:56:16.276 --> 01:56:18.277]  An official television report to the nation.
[01:56:19.657 --> 01:56:21.258]  I dare you but I know you.
[01:56:26.357 --> 01:56:32.703]  Yes, in modern warfare, our military leaders are finding that words and ideas are highly effective weapons.
[01:56:33.264 --> 01:56:38.209]  Your power as media is gradually being destroyed.
[01:56:38.449 --> 01:56:44.115]  Mainstream media, they're gonna take just what you said and just show the clip again out of context.
[01:56:44.335 --> 01:56:51.021]  Here, recruits with specialized backgrounds were taught the nature, methods, and techniques of propaganda and its dissemination.
[01:56:51.361 --> 01:56:57.727]  Stop lying and start telling the truth to the American people and to the world.
[01:56:57.847 --> 01:57:03.713]  Perhaps its most rewarding form of expression is news, for news is ready-made propaganda.
[01:57:04.193 --> 01:57:06.695]  Mainstream media is losing credibility, losing ratings.
[01:57:06.735 --> 01:57:10.359]  Even USA Today a few weeks ago admitted television for politics is dead.
[01:57:11.079 --> 01:57:12.320]  Uh, it faces its mortality.
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:27.790]  When you put Mr. Trump on television every minute of every day questioning, hoping he would say something that would blow him out of the water, and every day he got stronger and stronger, that shows that your media is not working.
[01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:29.511]  So why not work it for good?
[01:57:29.531 --> 01:57:35.515]  I know full well the media will take it out of context and say that Alex Jones endorses everything that Minister Liz Farrakhan has to say.
[01:57:35.535 --> 01:57:38.057]  You know, even if it was 30, 40 years ago, we all grow.
[01:57:38.257 --> 01:57:38.918]  Warn them.
[01:57:39.458 --> 01:57:40.859]  Tell them, I dare you.
[01:57:41.379 --> 01:57:43.880]  Well, I dare you to be good.
[01:57:44.381 --> 01:57:48.522]  And I know you can't be good unless a gun is put to your head.
[01:57:49.743 --> 01:57:52.204]  But gun is at your head right now.
[01:57:52.664 --> 01:57:53.905]  So go on and be good.
[01:57:53.985 --> 01:57:55.866]  It's better for you if you did.
[01:57:56.386 --> 01:57:58.307]  All right.
[01:57:58.407 --> 01:57:59.167]  There's more of that.
[01:57:59.227 --> 01:57:59.507]  OK.
[01:57:59.607 --> 01:58:00.988]  I mean, two hours of that.
[01:58:01.048 --> 01:58:02.228]  And it's all powerful.
[01:58:03.049 --> 01:58:03.889]  And it's got clips.
[01:58:03.949 --> 01:58:04.890]  I mean, really, it's a film.
[01:58:05.390 --> 01:58:07.611]  And I'm still sitting there trying to decide what to name all this.
[01:58:07.631 --> 01:58:10.212]  That's why I've kind of pushed it back 30 minutes, starting to release it here.
[01:58:11.698 --> 01:58:14.099]  It's going to be going up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:14.119 --> 01:58:16.520]  Let me spend 45 seconds trying to fund this operation.

[01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:39.020]  15% off as well.
[01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:41.121]  And your purchase makes it all possible.
[01:58:41.521 --> 01:58:43.002]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:43.342 --> 01:58:44.623]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:45.203 --> 01:58:46.703]  Is there a more important message out there?

[01:58:49.164 --> 01:58:50.165]  But you need them anyways.
[01:58:50.205 --> 01:58:50.905]  They're excellent.
[01:58:50.925 --> 01:58:52.626]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:53.226 --> 01:58:55.847]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:58.561 --> 01:58:59.402]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:58:59.522 --> 01:58:59.962]  Good, brother.
[01:59:00.102 --> 01:59:01.763]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:59:02.043 --> 01:59:03.584]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:59:03.744 --> 01:59:07.767]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:59:07.787 --> 01:59:10.368]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:59:10.408 --> 01:59:12.650]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:19.494]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using
[01:59:19.534 --> 01:59:24.120]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:25.743]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:59:25.783 --> 01:59:28.707]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:59:28.727 --> 01:59:30.189]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:59:30.489 --> 01:59:34.815]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet.
[01:59:35.015 --> 01:59:38.116]  And then concentrated, or maximum potency.
[01:59:38.316 --> 01:59:48.458]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going, goes right to the source.
[01:59:48.518 --> 01:59:50.258]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:59:50.318 --> 01:59:57.260]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:00:01.167 --> 02:00:05.832]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:09.916 --> 02:00:14.981]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:15.321 --> 02:00:17.603]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:00:28.698 --> 02:00:35.660]  Alright, I want to finish up with a few of your phone calls and then I've got to start getting to the Lewis Farrakhan interview that we've got to air in segments because there's breaks obviously on radio.
[02:00:35.940 --> 02:00:40.482]  We'll be playing clips of this right into the fourth hour with David Knight today.
[02:00:43.223 --> 02:00:45.123]  There is obviously a lot of things happening.
[02:00:45.203 --> 02:00:47.064]  Obama's gun grab agenda is in trouble.
[02:00:47.864 --> 02:00:53.866]  I cannot stress, and I'm glad they pointed it out to me, during a few breaks they go, why aren't you covering a Fast and Furious gun?
[02:00:55.593 --> 02:00:59.576]  50 Cal at El Chapo's hideout that our government shipped into Mexico.
[02:01:00.037 --> 02:01:05.080]  I mean, the real headline is, El Chapo was given 50 caliber by U.S.
[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:06.882]  government from Fast and Furious.
[02:01:06.962 --> 02:01:10.224]  Let's translate that Fox News headline and put that up, because that's what it is.
[02:01:10.284 --> 02:01:13.827]  And they shipped tens of thousands of guns in to blame the Second Amendment.
[02:01:13.867 --> 02:01:14.928]  Pull up the CBS headline.
[02:01:14.948 --> 02:01:15.348]  You can do it.
[02:01:15.548 --> 02:01:16.589]  Anybody can.
[02:01:17.550 --> 02:01:17.910]  Memo.
[02:01:19.611 --> 02:01:20.232]  ATF memo.
[02:01:20.592 --> 02:01:24.495]  Government plan to use Fast and Furious guns to pass more gun control.
[02:01:25.879 --> 02:01:27.981]  Because lower-level agents are like, why are we doing this?
[02:01:28.021 --> 02:01:29.021]  This is horrible!
[02:01:29.061 --> 02:01:31.563]  And they're like, this is how we're going to get the gun control passed.
[02:01:33.825 --> 02:01:34.626]  Amazing.
[02:01:35.967 --> 02:01:39.229]  But see, they wanted people to get caught with the guns but not know it came from the government.
[02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:42.091]  And now the government will not.
[02:01:42.692 --> 02:01:43.892]  There it is, CBS Evening News.
[02:01:43.912 --> 02:01:47.195]  ATF used Fast and Furious to make the case for gun registration.
[02:01:51.438 --> 02:01:53.940]  Folks, Nixon was impeached.
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:55.081]  He had to leave office.
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:02.061]  Because he had a hundred and something names in a safe he was planning to use the IRS on.
[02:02:03.821 --> 02:02:05.062]  Obama did it to tens of thousands.
[02:02:06.082 --> 02:02:10.303]  And then I've seen MSNBC repeatedly say, of course we're going after the Tea Party with the IRS.
[02:02:10.503 --> 02:02:11.703]  You're racist, you deserve it.
[02:02:12.723 --> 02:02:14.224]  Of course Hitler's rounding up Jews.
[02:02:14.404 --> 02:02:15.484]  You're racist, you deserve it.
[02:02:15.524 --> 02:02:19.245]  You know, it's just the open, naked persecution.
[02:02:19.285 --> 02:02:21.905]  You people are such totalitarians!
[02:02:23.726 --> 02:02:24.526]  You're shameful!
[02:02:26.647 --> 02:02:27.588]  You're dangerous!
[02:02:29.209 --> 02:02:32.192]  You have no self-preservation for your own family!
[02:02:32.212 --> 02:02:32.932]  You're idiots!
[02:02:33.633 --> 02:02:35.274]  There's no honor among thieves!
[02:02:36.435 --> 02:02:40.339]  And there sure is no honor among these eugenicists murdering devils!
[02:02:44.582 --> 02:02:49.527]  We ought to come in with a clip just where I go, Alex Jones goes super Sal Wayne or whatever.
[02:02:49.547 --> 02:02:51.188]  I don't really watch that show, Dragon Ball Z.
[02:02:53.789 --> 02:02:55.951]  I think it's the Star Wars intro.
[02:02:55.991 --> 02:02:58.513]  One of those is pretty funny.
[02:02:59.454 --> 02:03:00.375]  It's a figure of speech.
[02:03:00.635 --> 02:03:02.336]  Actually, I think Obama is a devil.
[02:03:02.356 --> 02:03:05.459]  But we got Farrakhan coming on talking about the white devil.
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:07.441]  I'm making fun of Farrakhan.
[02:03:07.461 --> 02:03:08.282]  It's just fun to do that.
[02:03:09.923 --> 02:03:12.685]  In fact, now I walk around the office talking like that.
[02:03:12.725 --> 02:03:13.206]  It's kind of fun.
[02:03:13.646 --> 02:03:14.467]  Let's go ahead.
[02:03:14.687 --> 02:03:15.888]  I'm not as serious as those folks.
[02:03:15.948 --> 02:03:16.769]  It's not meant meanly.
[02:03:17.249 --> 02:03:18.430]  I like to screw around a little bit.
[02:03:19.271 --> 02:03:21.193]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[02:03:23.246 --> 02:03:25.748]  Mike, in Mississippi, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:03:27.609 --> 02:03:28.029]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:28.369 --> 02:03:28.689]  Welcome.
[02:03:30.110 --> 02:03:31.011]  Welcome, sir.
[02:03:31.031 --> 02:03:31.631]  I appreciate you.
[02:03:31.651 --> 02:03:32.111]  It's an honor.
[02:03:34.052 --> 02:03:37.094]  First off, I love your ranting.
[02:03:37.875 --> 02:03:39.255]  It rounds up my neighborhood.
[02:03:39.636 --> 02:03:43.178]  I've got my neighborhood informed about you, and they listen to you.
[02:03:44.038 --> 02:03:51.863]  Also, my question is, if Donald Trump and Sarah Palin get into office, and if Donald Trump
[02:03:57.872 --> 02:04:02.493]  Well, obviously I'd consider it.
[02:04:02.653 --> 02:04:03.713]  A, I don't think it's going to happen.
[02:04:03.793 --> 02:04:07.194]  B, it would probably discredit me to be in the system.
[02:04:07.274 --> 02:04:11.855]  I think I'm more effective being a third party, you know, breaking down what's happening.
[02:04:13.955 --> 02:04:17.256]  And there's so many laws they can selectively enforce and they'd probably indict me for
[02:04:17.816 --> 02:04:21.098]  You know, not finishing a sandwich or something, or having a crooked toenail, as they say.
[02:04:22.018 --> 02:04:25.840]  But, look, I don't think Sarah Palin's perfect, but she's a lot better than Hillary.
[02:04:26.281 --> 02:04:28.662]  Great move if he has her as his vice presidential candidate.
[02:04:29.002 --> 02:04:30.703]  Then the liberals can all say she's a dumb woman.
[02:04:30.723 --> 02:04:38.267]  Because, you know, they're liberals, so they bring in radical Islamists to rape women, and they call women dumb, they don't agree with, and every stereotypical anti-female statement you can do.
[02:04:38.387 --> 02:04:41.869]  So, but, I mean, what would they put me in there as?
[02:04:42.669 --> 02:04:45.271]  As the director of federal communications or something?
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:48.462]  Maybe the Speaker of the House.
[02:04:48.822 --> 02:04:55.689]  Maybe the guy that gets up at the podium and tells what Trump has done, what's going on.
[02:04:55.709 --> 02:04:57.350]  I mean, real information.
[02:04:57.370 --> 02:04:58.031]  He's legged.
[02:04:58.331 --> 02:04:59.712]  I would love to be Donald Trump's legged.
[02:04:59.973 --> 02:05:00.713]  You know what?
[02:05:00.773 --> 02:05:07.360]  If they wanted to make me Speaker of the House, that is an elected position, then who they can appoint, I would do it.
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:08.301]  Yes, I would be Speaker of the House.
[02:05:09.192 --> 02:05:11.915]  Will you enter the Matrix, or fight its construction?
[02:05:12.435 --> 02:05:21.305]  As the World Economic Forum underway in Davos fantasizes about a future that doesn't need us, they openly talk about the imposition of new technologies to control us.
[02:05:21.765 --> 02:05:27.451]  The admission, for example, that driverless cars will be used as surveillance tools, with CEO Rob Leslie saying,
[02:05:29.994 --> 02:05:34.996]  ...from satellites, drones, and self-driving cars will continue to increase exponentially.
[02:05:35.337 --> 02:05:40.559]  In other words, these robot cars will be surveillance tools like satellites and drones.
[02:05:41.119 --> 02:05:53.005]  The Federal Department of Transportation is expected to create legislation outside of Congress's involvement this year to regulate communication equipment on cars that would communicate vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure.
[02:05:53.445 --> 02:05:58.168]  Detroit projects this to be a 46 billion dollar market in just four years.
[02:05:58.188 --> 02:06:01.670]  Or put another way, the price of cars is about to soar.
[02:06:01.930 --> 02:06:05.753]  Corporate profits and government surveillance, a match made in hell.
[02:06:05.993 --> 02:06:07.574]  This is David Knight for InfoWars.com
[02:06:08.624 --> 02:06:09.885]  I want more candy!
[02:06:09.905 --> 02:06:10.586]  I want more video games!
[02:06:10.766 --> 02:06:11.406]  Why, why, why?
[02:06:11.707 --> 02:06:21.094]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:06:21.434 --> 02:06:24.076]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:06:24.136 --> 02:06:27.479]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:06:27.699 --> 02:06:33.723]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:06:34.024 --> 02:06:38.387]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[02:06:38.447 --> 02:06:38.847]  I think so.
[02:07:08.527 --> 02:07:17.778]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[02:07:18.038 --> 02:07:22.644]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[02:07:22.724 --> 02:07:27.129]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[02:07:27.489 --> 02:07:30.391]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[02:07:30.531 --> 02:07:32.653]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[02:07:32.973 --> 02:07:36.396]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[02:07:36.516 --> 02:07:40.379]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[02:07:40.419 --> 02:07:49.066]  The research and development took over two years, but the result, as verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[02:07:49.446 --> 02:07:54.192]  Read the facts at InfoWarsLife.com about Winter Sun, Vitamin D3.
[02:07:54.472 --> 02:08:00.099]  Not only does Vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but Vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[02:08:00.420 --> 02:08:02.222]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[02:08:02.542 --> 02:08:05.206]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:19.249 --> 02:08:20.210]  You want answers?
[02:08:20.810 --> 02:08:21.852]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:22.132 --> 02:08:26.677]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:57.549 --> 02:09:01.312]  Alright folks, we are now into the third hour, fourth hour coming up.
[02:09:01.372 --> 02:09:13.801]  I'm going to start airing big chunks of the Louis Farrakhan interview, and we're also going to go to John Owyoming, Cody, Rashid, Donald, Anthony, and others as well, interspersed with pieces of it.
[02:09:14.562 --> 02:09:20.266]  And then the 55 minute or so boil down of the interview will be posted
[02:09:21.207 --> 02:09:28.437]  to Infowars.com by the bottom of the hour for folks that want to watch it without my commentary and without the calls and the rest of it.
[02:09:29.398 --> 02:09:38.150]  And then it'll go on into the fourth hour and I'll also play some more clips from the two-hour interview, the full interview, the unredacted interview tomorrow.
[02:09:39.502 --> 02:09:48.133]  But the full interview needs to get emailed out to a lot of folks, so you'll be able to do that and post it to your Facebook and the rest of it here in about 20 minutes.
[02:09:48.594 --> 02:09:50.256]  It'll go up on InfoWars.com.
[02:09:50.517 --> 02:09:52.599]  There's some promo clips up there already today.
[02:09:52.619 --> 02:09:54.462]  Lewis Farrakhan exposes the real white devil.
[02:09:54.662 --> 02:09:55.543]  That's the fellow reserve.
[02:09:56.804 --> 02:09:58.625]  And Lewis Farrakhan dares the media.
[02:09:59.226 --> 02:10:02.087]  Those are just short clips up there that are in the main interview.
[02:10:02.127 --> 02:10:02.887]  So that's coming up.
[02:10:03.548 --> 02:10:06.489]  But right now, let's go ahead and start airing excerpts.
[02:10:07.129 --> 02:10:08.790]  Here it is from the beginning.
[02:10:08.810 --> 02:10:10.371]  And I'm not going to narrate this.
[02:10:10.931 --> 02:10:12.312]  Some of this is more for TV.
[02:10:12.372 --> 02:10:20.356]  So there'll be some spots for radio stations and folks here, you know, 10 seconds of music or whatever, where it's showing time lapses of Phoenix or whatever, or showing the neighborhood.
[02:10:20.896 --> 02:10:22.237]  But again, this is a documentary.
[02:10:22.297 --> 02:10:24.638]  We're basically premiering here right
[02:10:24.938 --> 02:10:31.162]  Now, and then everyone else who's listening on radio, if you want to see it, it'll be on Infowars.com again in the next 20 minutes.
[02:10:31.662 --> 02:10:35.645]  And then later this afternoon, the full two-hour will be put up.
[02:10:35.685 --> 02:10:41.428]  We plan to release both of them together, but the computer died that it was rendering on, so it's being redone right now.
[02:10:42.369 --> 02:10:45.431]  So let's go ahead and go to the intro of this.
[02:10:47.571 --> 02:11:01.688]  If you don't know where the white devils are, Minister Louis Farrakhan, I can tell you right now they run the Democratic Party 100% and they've got black people in their web murdering your people and they love it and they think that people don't see them.
[02:11:01.708 --> 02:11:03.671]  Well, I see them and I know who they are.
[02:11:05.305 --> 02:11:15.532]  The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that Almighty God, Allah revealed to him that the white race is a race of devils.
[02:11:16.493 --> 02:11:21.856]  And the only way white folks, you can come out of this because you cannot be reformed.
[02:11:23.237 --> 02:11:26.519]  You cannot reform a devil.
[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:30.762]  All the prophets tried and failed.
[02:11:32.063 --> 02:11:33.484]  You have to kill the devil.
[02:11:34.733 --> 02:11:38.156]  Devil meaning wicked by nature.
[02:11:38.697 --> 02:11:45.403]  What more could a devil do than what has been done to the black man of America?
[02:11:46.304 --> 02:11:50.088]  Don't you send these children out here with the thought of murder in their mind.
[02:11:50.188 --> 02:11:50.889]  Oh, yes I am.
[02:11:52.583 --> 02:11:54.844]  It's puttin' to death time today.
[02:11:55.385 --> 02:11:58.947]  You know how mommy said when it's time to sleep, you've been raised in hell all day?
[02:11:59.467 --> 02:12:00.508]  Betty bye-bye.
[02:12:01.848 --> 02:12:04.170]  Time to go bye-bye, time to go to sleep.
[02:12:04.610 --> 02:12:09.173]  Well it's time for the white man's mind to be put to eternal rest.
[02:12:10.193 --> 02:12:17.517]  Any human being who gives themselves over to the doing of evil could be considered a devil.
[02:12:17.937 --> 02:12:32.725]  It is the divine power of Almighty God, Allah, that is now bringing about the destruction of the United States of America.
[02:12:32.905 --> 02:12:35.026]  So if the federal government
[02:12:37.179 --> 02:12:40.680]  We'll not intercede in our affairs!
[02:12:42.381 --> 02:12:48.003]  Then we must rise up and kill those who kill us!
[02:12:48.183 --> 02:12:49.764]  We want some of this earth!
[02:12:49.784 --> 02:12:55.206]  Because we'll tear this goddamn country up!
[02:12:56.146 --> 02:12:59.428]  Stop them and kill them!
[02:13:00.048 --> 02:13:05.130]  And let them feel the pain of death that we are feeling!
[02:13:10.032 --> 02:13:14.134]  Gentlemen, we're going to interview Louis Farrakhan.
[02:13:14.534 --> 02:13:15.635]  Doesn't do a lot of interviews.
[02:13:15.675 --> 02:13:17.936]  We're flying out this Sunday.
[02:13:17.956 --> 02:13:18.456]  Sunday afternoon.
[02:13:18.656 --> 02:13:19.176]  Sunday what time?
[02:13:19.196 --> 02:13:20.177]  3 o'clock.
[02:13:20.217 --> 02:13:22.097]  We're going to meet him on the 4th.
[02:13:22.558 --> 02:13:27.080]  I agree with a lot of stuff he says about Planned Parenthood, vaccines, false black terror.
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:28.380]  He's a very interesting guy.
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:29.941]  I want to talk to him about Malcolm X, you name it.
[02:13:30.921 --> 02:13:35.143]  I don't agree with, you know, white people can't be reformed and they're the devil.
[02:13:35.183 --> 02:13:36.284]  He hasn't said that in a long time.
[02:13:37.475 --> 02:13:49.056]  But I'm gonna really see how much he's evolved or grown and I'm really just seeking to open up a dialogue because somebody like Louis Farrakhan is so key when it comes to
[02:13:50.727 --> 02:13:57.895]  Stopping the big foundations and the social engineers in this country and around the world to really start a race war or divide and conquer.
[02:13:58.536 --> 02:14:03.801]  I mean, nobody's winning with this war against Islam overseas that's just really causing a Sunni-Shiite civil war.
[02:14:04.682 --> 02:14:07.845]  Nobody's winning with the males versus the females and the whole feminist thing.
[02:14:07.866 --> 02:14:10.889]  I don't want to hear anything about political correctness so much more because
[02:14:12.028 --> 02:14:19.356]  The last few years, I see Louis Farrakhan saying more and more things that I agree with, and then occasionally saying something that I disagree with.
[02:14:19.616 --> 02:14:31.888]  The Constitution warns that America must never let anyone set up a central bank.
[02:14:32.469 --> 02:14:33.010]  Right now!
[02:14:34.266 --> 02:14:42.635]  The President of the United States is given authority to assassinate American citizens!
[02:14:43.547 --> 02:14:48.950]  But I want to go over some of this research that you guys have done, that their people have sent us, as well.
[02:14:49.730 --> 02:14:59.575]  And hopefully we can do an interview that's really deep, and that isn't just, you know, picked up by the tabloids with whatever zingers he throws in there.
[02:14:59.635 --> 02:15:01.056]  And certainly you're not going to avoid that.
[02:15:01.957 --> 02:15:04.838]  But I really kind of want to find the real Louis Farrakhan here.
[02:15:06.639 --> 02:15:08.540]  Louis Walcott from Boston.
[02:15:08.580 --> 02:15:10.141]  Louis Walcott, front and center.
[02:15:14.052 --> 02:15:16.715]  I see you're quite a fellow up there in Boston.
[02:15:16.735 --> 02:15:22.440]  It says here that you're a track runner at English High School and that you've equaled every record in school, right?
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:25.363]  Yes, and I hope to break some next year when I put on a little more weight.
[02:15:25.463 --> 02:15:26.224]  You do, huh?
[02:15:26.444 --> 02:15:26.684]  Yes.
[02:15:26.864 --> 02:15:28.046]  How about your violin?
[02:15:28.066 --> 02:15:29.667]  Can you play that as fast as you can run?
[02:15:29.847 --> 02:15:31.769]  Well, not quite, but I've got a lot to learn.
[02:15:31.789 --> 02:15:33.651]  I hope to break some records with this someday.
[02:15:33.891 --> 02:15:36.072]  You're just a champion at heart, aren't you?
[02:15:36.212 --> 02:15:37.232]  The system doesn't want this.
[02:15:37.752 --> 02:15:39.013]  Us going out to interview this guy.
[02:15:39.033 --> 02:15:41.113]  We're supposed to be kept in our little electronic ghettos.
[02:15:41.493 --> 02:15:43.174]  We're supposed to be kept in our little reservations.
[02:15:43.574 --> 02:15:44.534]  Our little plantations.
[02:15:44.854 --> 02:15:45.935]  That's what Google does now.
[02:15:45.995 --> 02:15:47.475]  It sends you news you agree with.
[02:15:47.915 --> 02:15:53.477]  We want to go actually try to work with people and talk to people and humanize it.
[02:15:53.577 --> 02:15:55.818]  Because that's the last thing the globalists want.
[02:16:10.060 --> 02:16:14.301]  I've interviewed a lot of people, and I've snuck in places like Bohemian Grove.
[02:16:15.221 --> 02:16:18.102]  I've been attacked at political demonstrations, been arrested many times.
[02:16:19.022 --> 02:16:26.684]  But I gotta say, this is probably the most surreal drive I've ever made to go meet someone that I'm gonna be interviewing.
[02:16:27.724 --> 02:16:28.704]  Louis Farrakhan.
[02:16:32.085 --> 02:16:39.327]  I remember watching him on C-SPAN when I was really getting politically awake and aware, when I was like a sophomore in high school.
[02:16:40.578 --> 02:16:46.881]  And my mom would come in on the weekend while I'm eating lunch, watching it in the kitchen, and she'd say, what are you doing watching Lewis Faircott?
[02:16:48.142 --> 02:16:59.488]  The government for which you work is the number one enemy of the black man of America and the world!
[02:17:00.428 --> 02:17:03.250]  And here we are driving to their Phoenix headquarters.
[02:17:05.194 --> 02:17:12.138]  And look, it'd be easy to score a bunch of points and just be rude and make radical Islamic comments to him or whatever.
[02:17:12.838 --> 02:17:13.499]  I'm not going to do that.
[02:17:32.536 --> 02:17:38.058]  Thank you so much Mr. Jones for honoring us with your presence.
[02:17:39.558 --> 02:17:50.542]  We have watched you as you have watched us and I have learned a lot from InfoWars and some of the wonderful things that you have done.
[02:17:51.362 --> 02:17:54.783]  We're two people interested in truth.
[02:17:56.223 --> 02:18:01.745]  We're two people that live in the greatest nation on this earth.
[02:18:02.816 --> 02:18:14.162]  But the nation is not now what it could be if truth unfettered would be given to the American people.
[02:18:14.822 --> 02:18:18.404]  And perhaps through this dialogue that might happen.
[02:18:19.044 --> 02:18:22.666]  Well, I have to say thank you for having me in your home and with your family.
[02:18:24.156 --> 02:18:30.497]  Driving over here, I talked about some of the reasons that I wanted to interview you.
[02:18:31.418 --> 02:18:36.979]  And then when I had a chance to be in your home right before the interview, you basically mirrored what I had to say.
[02:18:37.039 --> 02:18:49.801]  So in your own words, I'd like you to really, for the TV viewing audience out there, go over some of the interesting things that you had to say to me and to the audience, because it just dovetailed exactly where I was going.
[02:18:49.821 --> 02:18:52.922]  And I have to say, I don't think I've ever had that happen before with an interview.
[02:18:53.662 --> 02:19:03.341]  So I'm really glad this is happening here today because as you know, there are forces that are trying to divide and conquer humanity and
[02:19:04.815 --> 02:19:08.217]  We're really coming to a crossroads where people are being told to choose a side.
[02:19:08.937 --> 02:19:12.499]  But I don't think the sides they're telling us to choose are real sides.
[02:19:13.239 --> 02:19:15.421]  So I'm trying to get people to think outside the box.
[02:19:15.481 --> 02:19:18.662]  And when I spoke to you earlier, that was basically your main focus.
[02:19:18.702 --> 02:19:21.143]  So I think this interview is meant to happen for a reason.
[02:19:21.183 --> 02:19:24.845]  So thank you so much for giving us the time on your busy schedule.
[02:19:25.806 --> 02:19:31.329]  So please, just if you could recapture what you told me in there earlier, it was very interesting.
[02:19:32.129 --> 02:19:54.694]  In the teachings of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, his great teacher, Master Farrukh Muhammad, who came to enliven the black people in particular, he taught us that he never used color in this question and answer.
[02:19:55.374 --> 02:19:58.195]  He asked the question, who are the 85%
[02:20:01.124 --> 02:20:02.605]  Who are the 10%?
[02:20:04.386 --> 02:20:06.347]  And who are the 5%?
[02:20:07.688 --> 02:20:23.018]  And in the answers that Mr. Muhammad gave that we studied, 85% of the people don't understand the law of cause and effect.
[02:20:23.899 --> 02:20:26.861]  And wherever there is an effect
[02:20:27.970 --> 02:20:43.957]  That is real, the cause is just as real though oft times the hidden hand that's manipulating and creating the effect and the circumstances that begin to divide and destroy.
[02:20:44.578 --> 02:20:55.783]  This kind of satanic mind is absolutely in control and that satanic mind is hiding
[02:20:57.185 --> 02:21:07.139]  With a mask of humanity and civility, but now it is gradually being exposed.
[02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:12.106]  There are those at the top who guide and govern
[02:21:12.967 --> 02:21:20.854]  Who are not necessarily the friend of the masses of the people that they are governing.
[02:21:21.455 --> 02:21:28.041]  So it is the 5% are just a small group who know
[02:21:28.781 --> 02:21:29.322]  The truth.
[02:21:29.742 --> 02:21:39.329]  Who understand the law of cause and effect and they don't believe in a mystery God that somewhere making things happen.
[02:21:39.709 --> 02:21:43.252]  If there's a real evil, then there's a real devil.
[02:21:43.592 --> 02:21:49.957]  If there's a real saint, then there's a real good person doing saintly things.
[02:21:50.417 --> 02:21:51.418]  So here we are.
[02:21:52.799 --> 02:21:57.863]  Now a conspiracy absolutely is in vogue.
[02:21:58.541 --> 02:22:09.226]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[02:22:09.547 --> 02:22:11.788]  It's time to stop submitting to this tyranny!
[02:22:11.928 --> 02:22:14.049]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[02:22:14.689 --> 02:22:17.471]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[02:22:18.992 --> 02:22:21.693]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[02:22:21.853 --> 02:22:25.455]  Tyranny with a capital T. You should reject these voices.
[02:22:26.235 --> 02:22:27.556]  Everything that's been done
[02:22:28.743 --> 02:22:45.228]  With torture, rendition, the NDAA, the Patriot Acts 1 and 2, from day one, was focused on the American people, period.
[02:22:46.629 --> 02:22:47.129]  That's it.
[02:22:48.220 --> 02:22:56.747]  It's always been about erasing the Bill of Rights and Constitution and rolling out NSA spying publicly, saying it's for Al-Qaeda.
[02:22:57.187 --> 02:23:01.251]  Rolling out torture, saying it's for Al-Qaeda, but it's really for the general public.
[02:23:01.591 --> 02:23:10.218]  Rolling out total control and the end of any underground free market systems in the name of fighting Al-Qaeda, but really shutting down any type of free commerce.
[02:23:10.678 --> 02:23:12.640]  This is all about converting us
[02:23:13.180 --> 02:23:27.188]  From a free society to a tyranny with a capital T. But I've asked certain people who say, well, you're a conspiracy theorist and they call you the same.
[02:23:28.028 --> 02:23:32.511]  I said, but do you read the scriptures of the Bible and Quran?
[02:23:33.741 --> 02:23:36.522]  Is not Satan real?
[02:23:37.162 --> 02:23:39.963]  Evil is real, so Satan is real.
[02:23:40.103 --> 02:23:47.364]  That really is a revolutionary thought, that if you question the establishment, you question what they're saying when they're known liars, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:23:47.384 --> 02:23:48.745]  That's like saying you're a heretic.
[02:23:49.305 --> 02:23:53.026]  Okay, well if we're a heretic against the system, I guess we're a heretic against the devil.
[02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:57.223]  Because this system, undoubtedly, you couldn't call it good.
[02:23:57.263 --> 02:23:59.185]  And from my research, that's my concern.
[02:23:59.886 --> 02:24:07.493]  The 5%, the 1%, the 1 tenth of 1% that actually run and control and manipulate things, they believe they're going to end up winning.
[02:24:07.533 --> 02:24:11.657]  They believe that they're getting ahead of people by keeping folks dumbed down.
[02:24:12.618 --> 02:24:20.403]  But, common sense shows, and just my gut tells me, you don't screw people over, and then long term get away with it, it comes back on you.
[02:24:20.724 --> 02:24:33.232]  And I think the people serving this system are some of the most deceived out there, because they know how the world really works, but they've decided to basically try to screw over their fellow humans, as if they're gonna get ahead by doing that.
[02:24:33.272 --> 02:24:37.295]  I mean, just anybody who's God-fearing in their gut level has to know that's a lie.
[02:24:38.916 --> 02:24:41.438]  Well, Mr. Jones, in reality,
[02:24:42.694 --> 02:24:46.395]  There are those who go along to get along.
[02:24:47.055 --> 02:24:56.018]  They know what they're doing, but they do not know the vast evil that they are a part of.
[02:24:56.899 --> 02:25:09.663]  So the politicians today, I looked at the many Republicans and Democrats that are trying to win the nomination of their party.
[02:25:11.385 --> 02:25:31.036]  And it says to me, you know, it's like a... I don't want to be vulgar, but it's like you, in any major city, you see women undressed, showing their wares for a john to buy them.
[02:25:33.257 --> 02:25:39.361]  And it's like politicians who don't have money, but have ideas.
[02:25:40.854 --> 02:25:54.944]  And they parade themselves before rich and powerful people to get money apparently for their ideas that the rich agree with.
[02:25:56.045 --> 02:26:05.412]  But the moment that they become what they're looking to become, they find that the rich have an agenda for them.
[02:26:06.414 --> 02:26:13.136]  That the rich have something to ask of them like the John asks of the prostitute.
[02:26:14.056 --> 02:26:23.538]  And that's one of the things that I admire about Mr. Trump because he told them all, I don't want your money.
[02:26:24.438 --> 02:26:28.419]  Politicians are all talk, no action.
[02:26:28.559 --> 02:26:29.760]  Most of them don't know what they're doing.
[02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:30.480]  They just could run.
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:33.661]  They're like, you know, like you wind them up and they run for office.
[02:26:33.961 --> 02:26:35.121]  They're controlled fully.
[02:26:36.798 --> 02:26:41.862]  By the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests fully.
[02:26:41.942 --> 02:26:47.326]  And you said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[02:26:47.646 --> 02:26:48.566]  You better believe it.
[02:26:48.647 --> 02:26:50.448]  So what specifically did they do?
[02:26:51.741 --> 02:26:56.884]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand.
[02:26:56.904 --> 02:26:57.744]  A lot of money.
[02:26:58.625 --> 02:27:12.832]  So from your experience, in all, you know, tracking the media, experiencing demonization campaigns, it's a big deal to have Louis Farrakhan come out and say, the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan come out and say, hey, we should look at Trump.
[02:27:13.133 --> 02:27:15.054]  Can you flesh that out and elaborate?
[02:27:15.094 --> 02:27:19.256]  Because undoubtedly, they're going to try to, you know, take that and then twist it.
[02:27:20.103 --> 02:27:33.890]  Well, I said recently that if the American people voted for Trump, he could take them into the abyss of hell.
[02:27:34.350 --> 02:27:48.977]  He's free, he's rich, he hates political correctness, and rightly so, but he said some things that
[02:27:50.308 --> 02:28:15.476]  I would hope that he would get around him persons who could help him because as a businessman par excellence he has people around him to help him do business but if he says let's go in to Iraq and take the oil
[02:28:17.822 --> 02:28:41.516]  That puts him in the class of those neoconservatives who had a project for a new American century and they wrote to Bill Clinton and Trent Lott and they talked about attacking Iraq and taking out Saddam Hussein.
[02:28:42.336 --> 02:29:04.043]  Not just because he may be in their eyes a dictator and was once on the payroll of the CIA in the war against Iran and Ayatollah Khomeini, but he had become a thorn in their sides and they wanted to get rid of him.
[02:29:04.063 --> 02:29:05.063]  He kind of become a Trump.
[02:29:05.851 --> 02:29:06.791]  He was doing his own thing.
[02:29:07.051 --> 02:29:07.371]  Yes.
[02:29:07.492 --> 02:29:08.172]  That was his crime.
[02:29:08.632 --> 02:29:17.515]  And that is the crime of those who refuse to come under the control of the IMF or the World Bank.
[02:29:17.775 --> 02:29:31.779]  Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
[02:29:33.969 --> 02:29:40.894]  Our government has gone into nations with money from our Congress.
[02:29:41.515 --> 02:29:41.835]  All right.
[02:29:41.875 --> 02:29:56.766]  To stimulate... We're going to come back, back it up, 15 seconds, and continue with this powerful interview that breaks the mold, and that's what InfoWars is all about, outside the box, true cutting-edge, leading-edge information warfare.
[02:29:58.075 --> 02:30:01.081]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.023 --> 02:30:04.688]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.915 --> 02:30:22.907]  The Intelligence Community's Inspector General has just revealed to lawmakers that Hillary Clinton had classified documents above Top Secret on her private email server, in addition to over 1,300 other classified emails.
[02:30:23.327 --> 02:30:32.316]  Access to information in the Special Access Program is more highly restricted, more sensitive than Top Secret, because it would likely reveal the source, putting lives at risk.
[02:30:32.856 --> 02:30:39.921]  We're constantly told that our money, our rule of law, our liberties must all be sacrificed on the altar of national security.
[02:30:40.081 --> 02:30:45.144]  Hillary has violated the surveillance state's religion, and she needs to be burned at the stake.
[02:30:45.564 --> 02:30:47.425]  Orange is the new pantsuit, Hillary.
[02:30:47.666 --> 02:30:54.570]  But she's being investigated by Obama's Justice Department, and she has about as much chance of going to jail as a Chicago cop.
[02:30:54.810 --> 02:31:00.374]  If she gets away with these crimes, the fraud of the surveillance state will be inescapably obvious to all.
[02:31:01.014 --> 02:31:06.918]  For more information, go to InfoWars.com.
[02:31:07.038 --> 02:31:08.019]  I'm David Knight.
[02:31:08.740 --> 02:31:12.462]  Secret 12, InfoWars Life's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:31:12.722 --> 02:31:18.847]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:31:19.027 --> 02:31:25.992]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[02:31:26.292 --> 02:31:35.143]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[02:31:35.423 --> 02:31:41.351]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:31:41.591 --> 02:31:44.735]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections and
[02:31:44.975 --> 02:31:45.775]  We're good to go.
[02:32:08.419 --> 02:32:13.220]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.
[02:32:13.480 --> 02:32:22.122]  Longevity integrates years of scientific research into creating fantastic products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, plant-derived minerals, and much more.
[02:32:22.162 --> 02:32:26.103]  Longevity also offers you an ingenious way to augment your income.

[02:32:35.305 --> 02:32:35.525]  I think?
[02:33:05.265 --> 02:33:06.786]  Just check it out for yourself today.
[02:33:18.755 --> 02:33:20.976]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:33:21.457 --> 02:33:23.919]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:24.399 --> 02:33:26.781]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.462 --> 02:33:35.402]  Jakari Jackson is here with us in the studio.
[02:33:36.403 --> 02:33:41.204]  He's one of our big pro-gun guys that covers a lot of the gun Second Amendment news for us.
[02:33:41.224 --> 02:33:53.987]  And I wanted to briefly spend a few minutes with him, then go to more of the exclusive interview with Louis Farrakhan, and then it's going to continue on to the fourth hour with David Knight, and the full interview as we speak is going up.
[02:33:54.347 --> 02:33:56.767]  Like I'm told, it's about to go up on Infowars.com.
[02:33:57.267 --> 02:34:00.268]  It has the title, Louis Farrakhan, Angel or Devil?
[02:34:01.226 --> 02:34:06.228]  Because obviously that's something that'll get people to watch it, and then they can make up their own mind.
[02:34:06.308 --> 02:34:14.531]  But it's overall a favorable angle because he was nice, he said a lot of things that we know are true, and we're trying to bring folks together.
[02:34:14.611 --> 02:34:15.392]  That's what this is all about.
[02:34:15.432 --> 02:34:17.772]  He says he's grown, we've grown, everybody grows.
[02:34:19.373 --> 02:34:24.615]  Basically, I was attempting to get David Duke to get past the whole race thing, and it didn't work too well.
[02:34:25.475 --> 02:34:26.856]  With Farrakhan, it went very well.
[02:34:27.696 --> 02:34:29.017]  And that's just all I'm trying to do.
[02:34:30.404 --> 02:34:36.447]  And then the left media was like, ah-ha, David Duke was mean to Alex Jones, Alex Jones is an idiot, because they want to just keep all this fighting going on.
[02:34:38.208 --> 02:34:46.113]  Now, that said, again, we're going to play more of this, and I promise I'm going to Cody and Rasheed and Donald and Anthony and Steve, we're going to get to all of you, I promise, you're there.
[02:34:46.133 --> 02:34:55.018]  And I'm going to hear more of this tomorrow as well, but the full interview is going up, the full two-plus hours, along with the 50-something minute documentary that you're watching right now.
[02:34:56.386 --> 02:35:10.540]  Which is again about bringing people together around issues that all of humanity is threatened by the rise of the robots because the elite have decided to angle the robots and angle their deployment to make humans obsolete with the whole system saying humans are bad, period, get rid of us.
[02:35:10.900 --> 02:35:12.261]  This is the elite saying this.
[02:35:12.321 --> 02:35:14.243]  So this is an attack on everyone.
[02:35:14.343 --> 02:35:14.844]  It's epic.
[02:35:15.164 --> 02:35:16.505]  It's now mainstream news.
[02:35:16.565 --> 02:35:18.687]  It's not, you know, myself talking about it 20 years ago.
[02:35:19.728 --> 02:35:21.670]  Or the Unabomber warning of it 25 years ago.
[02:35:22.010 --> 02:35:23.871]  Another guy that warned of it.
[02:35:24.211 --> 02:35:25.152]  It's the establishment.
[02:35:25.212 --> 02:35:25.572]  It's here.
[02:35:25.673 --> 02:35:26.233]  It's their view.
[02:35:26.553 --> 02:35:27.094]  We're in trouble.
[02:35:27.114 --> 02:35:28.455]  Of course, he worked for the CIA.
[02:35:28.795 --> 02:35:29.515]  That later came out.
[02:35:29.535 --> 02:35:31.557]  That's why Theodore Kaczynski knew all that.
[02:35:31.577 --> 02:35:32.538]  It was probably set up.
[02:35:32.618 --> 02:35:37.241]  But he's now locked up in a supermax for decades and the media's not allowed to see him.
[02:35:37.261 --> 02:35:41.144]  I hope they don't blame something on me sometime because I'm non-violent offensively.
[02:35:41.164 --> 02:35:41.664]  Folks know that.
[02:35:41.704 --> 02:35:42.365]  I'm defensive.
[02:35:44.682 --> 02:35:57.933]  Looking at the huge Fast and Furious news that came in, it's Fox News Associated Press, El Chapo had a .50 caliber rifle from Fast and Furious, not the movie Fast and Furious, Fast and Furious
[02:35:59.304 --> 02:36:03.129]  The gun-running program, and so let's turn Jakari's mic on.
[02:36:03.469 --> 02:36:07.253]  Jakari, this is a big, big deal, and the government won't release the serial number.
[02:36:07.294 --> 02:36:08.615]  They just hope this goes away.
[02:36:08.996 --> 02:36:19.208]  This is the kind of thing that captures the public's attention and brings Fast and Furious back that Hillary and Obama and all of them have not gotten in trouble for, or Big Sis, or Eric Holder.
[02:36:19.648 --> 02:36:26.052]  Yes, and I believe it was last year, maybe the year before, a Mexican beauty queen was in a shootout that involved a Fast and Furious gun.
[02:36:26.413 --> 02:36:33.717]  So when we see stories like this, El Chapo, you know, the beauty queen, it brings it back to the American attention because so often we see so many scandals now.
[02:36:33.797 --> 02:36:35.378]  It's like a new week, new scandal.
[02:36:35.619 --> 02:36:41.983]  So people blow through this stuff pretty fast and it's hard to keep everybody's focus on one particular issue because next week it's going to be something else.
[02:36:42.423 --> 02:36:46.306]  But with the capture of El Chapo, I was actually watching a piece on him
[02:36:47.086 --> 02:36:52.293]  Last night, talking about the first time he escaped from the prison and, you know, the very elaborate thing.
[02:36:52.333 --> 02:36:55.056]  They dug a tunnel, you know, 90 feet underground.
[02:36:55.076 --> 02:36:56.278]  Trained people in Germany?
[02:36:56.418 --> 02:37:01.364]  Yeah, it was quite interesting and fascinating how this guy does it, but, you know, he's been captured.
[02:37:01.484 --> 02:37:02.906]  Once again, we'll see if he escapes.
[02:37:03.206 --> 02:37:13.073]  But regardless, it does bring attention back to the 2nd Amendment issue and Obama saying that the reason why they have so much gun violence in Mexico is because of the American gun owners.
[02:37:13.133 --> 02:37:21.419]  The 2nd Amendment, meanwhile, he's giving guns to these cartel members, to El Chapo, and then they want to blame the violence in Mexico on the American gun owner.
[02:37:21.479 --> 02:37:29.884]  No, it's because of the cartels there and the American, the people in the American government, not the American government as a whole, who continue to fund groups like the...
[02:37:30.765 --> 02:37:33.787]  But if they don't bring them to justice, it is the American government.
[02:37:33.827 --> 02:37:40.550]  We can say it's basically rotten at the top, so many good people at low levels, mid-levels, but they have no power.
[02:37:41.071 --> 02:37:46.994]  Yeah, and we've seen the documents from CBS News saying that Fast and Furious was there to blame the Second Amendment.
[02:37:47.114 --> 02:37:47.414]  Incredible.
[02:37:47.434 --> 02:37:48.855]  They want to demonize people.
[02:37:48.915 --> 02:37:51.536]  Then you got Obama making these speeches in Mexico.
[02:37:51.556 --> 02:37:53.477]  Eric Holder saying we need all these smart guns.
[02:37:53.817 --> 02:38:00.221]  Meanwhile, I will say they're doing background checks on the people that they're giving these guns to because they're trying to give them to the worst people possible.
[02:38:00.461 --> 02:38:00.962]  We're good to go.
[02:38:16.624 --> 02:38:18.605]  Red-handed, hand in the cookie jar.
[02:38:18.785 --> 02:38:19.546]  It is incredible.
[02:38:19.646 --> 02:38:21.727]  An actual false flag, red-handed.
[02:38:22.407 --> 02:38:23.968]  This is just simply amazing.
[02:38:24.628 --> 02:38:26.249]  Jakari, we got Weldon Henson in there.
[02:38:26.269 --> 02:38:37.555]  You guys normally are the fellows that when the new gun shirts come in, A, you want one because you like the Second Amendment and you're a big shooter, and so does Weldon, but B, you guys are in pretty good shape, so you're good models to wear the shirts.
[02:38:37.915 --> 02:38:39.416]  These just came in yesterday.
[02:38:39.436 --> 02:38:40.597]  We the people
[02:38:41.517 --> 02:38:43.600]  It's got a M4 AR-15 on the front.
[02:38:43.900 --> 02:38:45.602]  We will never surrender.
[02:38:46.323 --> 02:38:51.690]  And on the back, it simply says, come and take it, the famous Texas Gonzalez statement.
[02:38:51.971 --> 02:38:54.975]  And then on the right shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[02:38:57.054 --> 02:39:00.038]  And folks, this is another limited edition shirt.
[02:39:00.138 --> 02:39:03.082]  The Hillary for Prison shirts are starting to sell out.
[02:39:03.222 --> 02:39:04.344]  We're not making more.
[02:39:04.804 --> 02:39:06.887]  I wish I wouldn't have made that a limited edition, but whatever.
[02:39:06.907 --> 02:39:08.509]  You make a limited edition, people seem to like that.
[02:39:08.569 --> 02:39:09.330]  They order more of them.
[02:39:09.531 --> 02:39:10.692]  That helps fund the operation.
[02:39:10.972 --> 02:39:12.555]  Gets more great shirts out there on the street.
[02:39:13.255 --> 02:39:26.224]  Folks, we the people will never surrender with the M4, with the main gun they want to man first, and then on the back come and take it on the right arm, Infowars.com, where you can then point to your arm and tell folks where to go to learn more truth.
[02:39:26.984 --> 02:39:31.607]  It's $19.95, this shirt is high quality, and it funds the operation.
[02:39:31.647 --> 02:39:38.372]  We need to sell a lot of these, be able to send reporters, I mean I would have sent reporters to Davos, the public Bilderberg meeting that's going on right now, but
[02:39:39.445 --> 02:39:40.066]  We don't have the funds.
[02:39:40.986 --> 02:39:42.147]  I've sent folks to Bilderberg.
[02:39:42.167 --> 02:39:46.811]  I've sent folks to cover other events, you know, the attacks in Paris.
[02:39:47.472 --> 02:39:50.134]  I mean, it comes down to the fact that we need a budget.
[02:39:50.154 --> 02:40:01.684]  We need to sell a lot of t-shirts, a lot of water filters, a lot of nutraceuticals, you know, to have this great group of reporters and crew, investigative journalists and editors and legal and, you know, the bandwidth costs and all of it.
[02:40:02.044 --> 02:40:03.365]  We're victims of our own success.
[02:40:03.806 --> 02:40:04.326]  I don't want to have to
[02:40:04.386 --> 02:40:08.009]  Get rid of the free video feed to the daytime radio show that's four hours long.
[02:40:08.329 --> 02:40:11.171]  But when 15 to 16 million people watch it a month, it's tripled.
[02:40:12.012 --> 02:40:13.593]  And again, that's just one feed we put out.
[02:40:14.333 --> 02:40:20.738]  I started promoting it, and it's just, it's, in fact, I want to do an ad on this, call for folks to support us, because we can show the metric of the bandwidth.
[02:40:20.938 --> 02:40:22.579]  I can show the bills.
[02:40:22.659 --> 02:40:23.079]  I mean, $56,000.
[02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:26.022]  And we got some of the cheapest bandwidth out there.
[02:40:26.922 --> 02:40:30.004]  So, I mean, believe me, we've shopped around, and it's good bandwidth.
[02:40:31.265 --> 02:40:33.027]  And it's just a victim of our own success.
[02:40:34.390 --> 02:40:37.188]  When we have this many viewers, again in a month, just...
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:42.863]  On what, 16 million times people connected, and then watched, I think an average was about 30 minutes.
[02:40:42.883 --> 02:40:44.104]  But the point is, that's a lot of people.
[02:40:44.244 --> 02:40:46.666]  That's one small part of our audience, but it's growing.
[02:40:46.986 --> 02:40:49.608]  It shows the exponential growth, but it costs so much money.
[02:40:50.188 --> 02:40:52.810]  So, InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:40:53.471 --> 02:40:54.431]  What's your view on the shirt?
[02:40:54.572 --> 02:40:55.973]  I personally think it's awesome.
[02:40:56.853 --> 02:41:00.316]  The graphics crew came up with it, because I was saying, we'll never surrender our guns on air.
[02:41:00.336 --> 02:41:02.017]  We've got to make a declaration of this.
[02:41:02.097 --> 02:41:04.439]  I kind of wanted one with like the Alamo in that statement.
[02:41:04.479 --> 02:41:05.359]  They said, no, this is better.
[02:41:05.419 --> 02:41:05.900]  I agree.
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:07.681]  What's your view on the shirt, Jakari?
[02:41:08.041 --> 02:41:14.884]  That's just another in the series that we have, you know, it's a great shirt, high quality shirt, you know, very comfortable, and it helps you to meet like-minded people.
[02:41:14.965 --> 02:41:31.273]  You know, you can go back through the archives, you can see the other Come and Take It shirts we have, but, you know, this is the new one, it's a great one, and you can see by the success of the Hillary shirt, you know, how much publicity we've gotten off that, how many like-minded people have come together, you know, they're wearing it at political rallies, you know, it's... Trump's talking about it!
[02:41:31.353 --> 02:41:37.556]  Yeah, I mean, it's a very popular shirt, and this can be that as well, if people get out there and make this an issue, and just wear it, and you know, it's a great shirt.
[02:41:37.756 --> 02:41:48.480]  The Hillary shirt we came out with four months before the end of the year, and then literally about early December a huge shipment came in, made right here in America, printed here in America.
[02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:51.281]  Most shirts are made in America, we have cheaper ones that aren't, people choose.
[02:41:51.541 --> 02:41:58.623]  But the point is that it's super popular, and other people I'm sure are making them, they are now, and that's fine.
[02:41:58.943 --> 02:42:00.084]  We're done when these are sold out.
[02:42:00.124 --> 02:42:03.445]  They're available at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[02:42:06.946 --> 02:42:09.388]  But this shirt again, I'm not gonna do this for four months.
[02:42:09.428 --> 02:42:15.573]  This is a shirt, limited edition, that will go for 2016 and then that's it.
[02:42:15.753 --> 02:42:16.193]  It's gone.
[02:42:16.233 --> 02:42:21.878]  So you've got basically 11 months and 10 days to get this shirt and then it's gone forever.
[02:42:22.118 --> 02:42:26.061]  We got a lot of shirts that are not, you know, the Obama Joker one was limited edition.
[02:42:26.121 --> 02:42:27.562]  Man, I wish I wouldn't have got rid of that one.
[02:42:27.722 --> 02:42:31.204]  That was the all-time best-selling shirt ever and financed a bunch of stuff.
[02:42:31.464 --> 02:42:34.947]  In fact, I was able to hire three or four reporters.
[02:42:34.967 --> 02:42:38.309]  You were part of that wave, Jakari, off the money that shirt made.
[02:42:38.749 --> 02:42:39.870]  That was our all-time best.
[02:42:39.970 --> 02:42:40.330]  Oh, really?
[02:42:40.551 --> 02:42:41.251]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:42:41.291 --> 02:42:43.052]  But, you know, that's it, folks.
[02:42:43.132 --> 02:42:44.513]  InfowarsStore.com.
[02:42:44.533 --> 02:42:46.515]  We're going to go to this Farrakhan piece in a minute.
[02:42:46.535 --> 02:42:47.395]  Stay with me, Jakari.
[02:42:47.895 --> 02:42:50.597]  But let's go briefly to Weldon Henson in there in the control room.
[02:42:51.318 --> 02:42:53.919]  Weldon, I just said, hey, throw one of these shirts on, you know, drag you in here.
[02:42:54.220 --> 02:42:57.582]  Give us your view on the new shirt, Weldon, because you're back there running the warehouse.
[02:42:57.722 --> 02:42:57.995]  We're good.
[02:42:58.851 --> 02:43:06.595]  Well, obviously, this is one that we had made kind of in response to the fact that every time we turn around, the Second Amendment is getting attacked.
[02:43:06.655 --> 02:43:13.159]  Obviously, Obama is on the war path to destroy the Second Amendment with his executive actions.
[02:43:13.499 --> 02:43:14.720]  So this is kind of a response.
[02:43:14.780 --> 02:43:19.762]  This shirt is a way for InfoWars to respond to that, and it helps fund the operation.
[02:43:19.822 --> 02:43:21.283]  And of course, we just got these in.
[02:43:21.503 --> 02:43:23.344]  I had to put one on instantly.
[02:43:23.384 --> 02:43:28.207]  I know you told me to, but I already had one in my office ready to go, so it's good to get over here and talk about it.
[02:43:28.507 --> 02:43:29.647]  Everyone needs to pick one up.
[02:43:29.888 --> 02:43:31.348]  It's a great conversation starter.
[02:43:31.408 --> 02:43:34.209]  Like Jakari said, you know, you meet like-minded people.
[02:43:34.309 --> 02:43:34.789]  Get one of these.
[02:43:34.809 --> 02:43:35.810]  Wear it to the gun range.
[02:43:35.850 --> 02:43:36.670]  Wear it out to dinner.
[02:43:37.090 --> 02:43:39.011]  You know, let's get people thinking about this.
[02:43:39.031 --> 02:43:40.992]  These politically correct people want to end speech.
[02:43:41.032 --> 02:43:42.812]  They want to bully us and throw it in our face.
[02:43:43.313 --> 02:43:46.594]  This is almost like doing an open carry, but a lot safer.
[02:43:47.154 --> 02:43:48.895]  Open carry is the cutting edge of civil rights.
[02:43:48.935 --> 02:43:51.976]  People exercising it to show people that guns haven't been banned.
[02:43:52.276 --> 02:43:53.477]  It's breaking that perception.
[02:43:53.517 --> 02:43:54.477]  We're beginning to win.
[02:43:54.497 --> 02:43:56.998]  But this is the next best thing to that, I think.
[02:43:58.025 --> 02:44:04.628]  Absolutely, because they demonize open carriers here in Texas, but it's the actions of the open carriers, guys like C.J.
[02:44:04.668 --> 02:44:15.552]  Grisham and Cargill and all these other guys here in Texas who actually made open carry a law for your pistol here in the state of Texas, because a lot of people think of Texas as a pro-gun state, but you see these guys walking around.
[02:44:15.572 --> 02:44:16.672]  It wasn't one of the best, but now it is.
[02:44:16.892 --> 02:44:22.973]  Yeah, you see these guys walking around with their M4s and their AKs because they're trying to make the point that they couldn't carry their pistols.
[02:44:22.993 --> 02:44:26.754]  And thanks to the work that they've done, they've been demonized in a lot of different areas.
[02:44:26.794 --> 02:44:28.054]  But they won.
[02:44:28.114 --> 02:44:28.954]  Yeah, they brought the attention.
[02:44:28.974 --> 02:44:32.115]  And the governor's now talking about the new world order and world government and he's going to battle it.
[02:44:32.435 --> 02:44:33.275]  We're winning.
[02:44:33.335 --> 02:44:34.375]  We're marching forward.
[02:44:34.655 --> 02:44:35.656]  We're working with everybody.
[02:44:35.696 --> 02:44:36.676]  And I'm glad Weldon brought the point.
[02:44:36.916 --> 02:44:40.277]  The shirt's a protest shirt in the face of the system coming after them.
[02:44:40.457 --> 02:44:41.337]  You're not getting our guns.
[02:44:41.357 --> 02:44:41.997]  Weldon, anything else?
[02:44:42.853 --> 02:44:48.896]  I just want to say, you know, to everybody out there, there is a lot of support for what we're standing for in the Second Amendment everywhere you go.
[02:44:48.956 --> 02:45:00.202]  I know people get discouraged, but you know, I was up at the Capitol on Saturday, and everywhere I looked, you know, they had the state troopers up there, and they were carrying AR-15s, so I just started talking to them, and they were all fans of yours.
[02:45:00.522 --> 02:45:01.942]  They were all pro-Second Amendment.
[02:45:02.083 --> 02:45:06.645]  Everywhere I go, I meet people that are pro-Second Amendment, and they're worried about what's going on in this country.
[02:45:07.409 --> 02:45:12.930]  By the way, I want to be clear, because I don't even know you went up to the Capitol this weekend, Weldon, but I know that's how politically involved you are for this country.
[02:45:12.950 --> 02:45:14.590]  You know, that's what we do in our off time.
[02:45:15.430 --> 02:45:20.551]  We're not bragging when we say the police are waking up, the military's waking up, white people, black people, everybody's just people.
[02:45:23.332 --> 02:45:27.052]  It's really true that just InfoWars' one focal point is exploding.
[02:45:27.552 --> 02:45:36.634]  It's absolutely exploding, and it's just crazy, just as a gauge of how serious people are getting about what's happening.
[02:45:38.123 --> 02:45:39.404]  It's a huge war going on.
[02:45:39.464 --> 02:45:41.225]  It's a battle every day for our rights.
[02:45:41.725 --> 02:45:43.246]  But, you know, we are winning.
[02:45:43.306 --> 02:45:44.046]  You say we're winning.
[02:45:44.306 --> 02:45:46.928]  It's such large scale, but we are having an impact.
[02:45:47.308 --> 02:45:48.609]  We are affecting change.
[02:45:49.149 --> 02:45:51.751]  It's why this is all so important here at InfoWars.
[02:45:51.771 --> 02:45:52.831]  You're doing a great job, Alex.
[02:45:52.891 --> 02:45:54.312]  No, you are, and the listeners are.
[02:45:54.332 --> 02:45:55.152]  Please don't thank me.
[02:45:55.252 --> 02:45:55.873]  I'm telling you.
[02:45:55.893 --> 02:45:57.554]  Everybody tolerates me around here.
[02:45:57.614 --> 02:45:58.274]  I'm the big guy.
[02:45:58.654 --> 02:45:59.975]  We just need to remember we are winning.
[02:46:00.015 --> 02:46:01.216]  We're having an effect.
[02:46:02.657 --> 02:46:03.777]  Well, you guys are awesome.
[02:46:03.797 --> 02:46:04.538]  God bless you, Weldon.
[02:46:04.558 --> 02:46:05.458]  God bless you, Jakari.
[02:46:05.498 --> 02:46:11.039]  Let's go back to the Louis Farrakhan exclusive interview and the 50-minute boil-down documentary.
[02:46:11.379 --> 02:46:14.340]  Louis Farrakhan, Angel or Devil, is now up on Infowars.com.
[02:46:14.540 --> 02:46:15.461]  It's going up on Facebook.
[02:46:15.481 --> 02:46:16.921]  We're tweeting it out at RealAlexJones.
[02:46:17.301 --> 02:46:26.804]  And then again in the next few hours, the full, unredacted, and it's a documentary as well, two-plus-hour film on Louis Farrakhan is coming out.
[02:46:26.824 --> 02:46:29.465]  We're going to title that... I don't know what to title it.
[02:46:29.485 --> 02:46:30.205]  The most important...
[02:46:31.676 --> 02:46:34.117]  I'm coming up with that title soon, so let's go back to Louis Farrakhan.
[02:46:35.118 --> 02:46:51.547]  Our government has gone into nations with money from our Congress to stimulate the dissatisfied and then arm them against a government that is their government.
[02:46:52.247 --> 02:46:58.851]  That's what America did in Libya, that's what they're doing in Syria, and
[02:46:59.611 --> 02:47:11.696]  The blowback now is they have created a refugee crisis that is destabilizing the countries in Europe.
[02:47:12.216 --> 02:47:22.920]  So when Mr. Trump said, we can't allow these Muslims, refugees into America.
[02:47:22.940 --> 02:47:26.502]  Now a lot of people were upset with him.
[02:47:27.389 --> 02:47:38.711]  But I know, sir, that the hatred for America in the Muslim world is building, as we told Mr. Bush,
[02:47:40.567 --> 02:47:45.269]  No Muslim leader could call for jihad and have it stick.
[02:47:45.749 --> 02:47:51.931]  No Muslim leader had the power to unite the whole Muslim world.
[02:47:52.291 --> 02:48:00.414]  I said, but America's policies will unite those people against the West, and it is happening.
[02:48:00.794 --> 02:48:07.897]  So in this way, Mr. Trump, I think, is wise to vet
[02:48:09.995 --> 02:48:19.740]  Anyone coming from that area into America because the hatred for America is in the streets now.
[02:48:20.241 --> 02:48:29.966]  So if those people are refugees and America feels I gotta let 10,000 of them in because America created the problem.
[02:48:30.888 --> 02:48:40.070]  Now, if you let them in and you don't vet them carefully, you might be letting in your own destruction.
[02:48:40.730 --> 02:48:47.992]  We have before us the opportunity to forge, for ourselves and for future generations, a new world order.
[02:48:48.732 --> 02:48:54.653]  A world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations.
[02:48:55.953 --> 02:48:58.514]  When we are successful, and we will be,
[02:48:59.418 --> 02:49:11.281]  We have a real chance at this new world order, an order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the UN's founders.
[02:49:12.041 --> 02:49:25.905]  No matter how hard the schemers plan to destroy the good that can come to the people with proper governance,
[02:49:28.001 --> 02:49:35.096]  They are losing and they will lose because they have set a trap.
[02:49:35.874 --> 02:49:38.836]  But they're getting caught in their own trap.
[02:49:39.296 --> 02:49:41.738]  The American people are waking up.
[02:49:42.279 --> 02:49:46.762]  The masses all over the Earth are beginning to rise.
[02:49:47.302 --> 02:50:03.413]  And that's why Zbigniew Brzezinski said... Namely, in earlier times, it was easier to control a million people, literally, it was easier to control a million people than physically to kill a million people.
[02:50:04.934 --> 02:50:12.319]  Today it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people.
[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:33.133]  So all kinds of schemes are developing to kill mass populations and you may have heard us say that the gentleman that was the Secretary of State under Nixon, Mr. Kissinger, developed this memo called Memo 200.
[02:50:35.295 --> 02:50:59.210]  In which he said that 2 billion people on this earth had to be culled because the resources of the earth are getting shorter, the population getting more, so we gotta kill billions of people.
[02:51:00.070 --> 02:51:02.392]  And it's going on as we speak.
[02:51:03.413 --> 02:51:03.593]  The
[02:51:04.788 --> 02:51:05.469]  Radical.
[02:51:09.131 --> 02:51:11.833]  You call them the pharmaceutical companies?
[02:51:12.714 --> 02:51:13.995]  Who goes against them?
[02:51:14.735 --> 02:51:15.256]  Nobody.
[02:51:16.797 --> 02:51:19.779]  Who goes against the gun lobby?
[02:51:20.620 --> 02:51:21.200]  Nobody.
[02:51:22.121 --> 02:51:24.643]  They don't have the power to change it.
[02:51:25.564 --> 02:51:28.905]  It's not that the American people shouldn't have guns.
[02:51:29.745 --> 02:51:32.586]  That's what the Constitution declares.
[02:51:33.226 --> 02:51:38.447]  We as Muslims, our leader told us, no weapons.
[02:51:39.427 --> 02:51:42.188]  Not even as much as a penknife.
[02:51:42.848 --> 02:51:50.590]  Because in our homes, the nation of Islam has taught hundreds of thousands of people.
[02:51:51.190 --> 02:51:53.671]  And in the nation, you never hear
[02:51:55.029 --> 02:51:58.691]  Muslim killing Muslim in an argument.
[02:51:59.651 --> 02:52:04.334]  Because we are taught that it's the truth that settles all arguments.
[02:52:04.674 --> 02:52:08.376]  So we don't have a gun to reach for or a knife to reach for.
[02:52:08.676 --> 02:52:14.199]  We reach for our intelligence and we argue over the truth.
[02:52:14.299 --> 02:52:15.320]  What is the truth?
[02:52:15.580 --> 02:52:22.884]  And if the truth is from my wife and it condemns an action of mine, I have to bow down to the truth.
[02:52:22.984 --> 02:52:23.384]  I can't
[02:52:23.704 --> 02:52:27.273]  Raise my fist and strike him, cause it's against our law!
[02:52:45.962 --> 02:52:49.466]  I agree with you that free speech and liberation trumps violence.
[02:52:49.926 --> 02:52:56.292]  The problem is when an outside group comes who isn't going to listen to what you're having to say, then you have a right to defend yourself.
[02:52:56.633 --> 02:53:00.076]  But separately, because that's one of my main questions and I've got to get to it with you.
[02:53:01.337 --> 02:53:03.439]  And then you just started getting into it before I even asked it.
[02:53:03.459 --> 02:53:08.362]  This is an amazing interview because you're just following where I was going to go without me even asking the question, so it's amazing.
[02:53:08.902 --> 02:53:09.703]  But eugenics.
[02:53:10.724 --> 02:53:14.987]  Yes, 1,100 people get shot by the police every year and killed.
[02:53:15.407 --> 02:53:20.090]  In some cases, some cases, in fact in a lot of cases, it's in the wrong.
[02:53:20.511 --> 02:53:22.192]  Sometimes bad officers get away with it.
[02:53:22.692 --> 02:53:24.093]  I've written books on the subject.
[02:53:24.133 --> 02:53:24.994]  I've criticized it.
[02:53:25.014 --> 02:53:27.696]  I'm the guy that tried to expose the police state.
[02:53:28.656 --> 02:53:31.998]  But the police are only one small part of the police state.
[02:53:32.658 --> 02:53:39.741]  And for me it becomes a scapegoat when we just make it about them and then project what bad officers do on other officers.
[02:53:40.141 --> 02:53:46.104]  And then I look separately at how they used hatred of police in Ukraine, George Soros did.
[02:53:47.267 --> 02:53:54.773]  To just now overthrow that government, not to empower the people, it was an elected government, but to create an even bigger crisis.
[02:53:54.853 --> 02:54:01.699]  So I see more than a million black people aborted every year on average.
[02:54:01.839 --> 02:54:07.243]  In some states, more than half the abortions are wonderful, beautiful black babies.
[02:54:08.104 --> 02:54:14.710]  And I don't hear a word about this from the liberal black leaders, the white black leaders, or any of them.
[02:54:14.750 --> 02:54:15.851]  I know you speak about it.
[02:54:16.271 --> 02:54:17.852]  And so I kind of measure it.
[02:54:17.872 --> 02:54:20.054]  You got a million dead black people over here.
[02:54:20.695 --> 02:54:22.316]  Chopped up babies.
[02:54:22.596 --> 02:54:23.457]  We know they're innocent.
[02:54:23.837 --> 02:54:28.381]  You can even watch some of the sonogram videos where they're fighting the scalpel with their hands and their feet.
[02:54:28.401 --> 02:54:32.605]  I don't care what color the baby is, they fight for their lives because they're red-blooded.
[02:54:33.125 --> 02:54:34.687]  And then over here I've got 1,100 dead people.
[02:54:36.770 --> 02:54:38.291]  Maybe a thousand of them are black.
[02:54:38.771 --> 02:54:41.812]  Let's say all thousand of them were murdered in cold blood.
[02:54:42.633 --> 02:54:46.494]  The system's telling me to get upset about that all day and make that my main focus.
[02:54:47.715 --> 02:54:53.237]  When over here I've got a million dead black people and millions of dead white people and millions of dead other human beings.
[02:54:53.698 --> 02:54:56.139]  I think the greatest sin in the world is bringing children into the world.
[02:54:56.499 --> 02:55:00.101]  Delinquents, prisoners, all sorts of things, just mocked when they're born.
[02:55:00.321 --> 02:55:02.942]  And then I read Margaret Sanger going, we're going to pose as liberals.
[02:55:03.482 --> 02:55:10.809]  We're going to go into these black communities, we're going to buy off their preachers, we're going to get control of them, and we're going to get them in these big cities.
[02:55:10.869 --> 02:55:19.418]  And I look at the big liberal cities where they've taken the guns from the black people, where they've shipped the drugs in, where they've got the Planned Parenthood on every corner, and I tell you,
[02:55:20.078 --> 02:55:24.861]  Growing up around conservatives, libertarians, I never heard racist talk in Dallas, Texas.
[02:55:24.901 --> 02:55:32.284]  When I started hearing the racist talk was when I would get around liberals and Democrats and people when I was in college and when I was getting politically involved.
[02:55:32.544 --> 02:55:37.667]  I'd have white liberals and black liberals come up to me and they say, nobody wants these trashy black scum.
[02:55:37.947 --> 02:55:39.468]  And if you want them, you take them.
[02:55:39.568 --> 02:55:41.450]  Why are you so worried about a f***ing zyko?
[02:55:41.930 --> 02:55:44.373]  Ultimately, your sympathies do not lie with black people.
[02:55:44.413 --> 02:55:49.818]  They lie with your racist, white, middle-class agenda, and that's where we'll always lie, and you will be destroyed holding that line.
[02:55:50.038 --> 02:55:52.260]  Okay, I adopted two children.
[02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:54.082]  Oh, good for you, white savior.
[02:55:54.142 --> 02:55:54.882]  Aren't you so proud?
[02:55:54.922 --> 02:55:55.523]  You're f***ing white.
[02:55:55.543 --> 02:55:56.043]  They're not white.
[02:55:57.999 --> 02:55:59.260]  How many did you adopt?
[02:55:59.280 --> 02:55:59.700]  How many?
[02:55:59.760 --> 02:56:00.060]  How many?
[02:56:00.080 --> 02:56:00.601]  I kill my kids.
[02:56:19.672 --> 02:56:21.133]  I pay all my money for that.
[02:56:21.353 --> 02:56:24.176]  I get free abortions on demand without apology.
[02:56:24.196 --> 02:56:25.897]  You are wicked as hell.
[02:56:26.077 --> 02:56:27.238]  And I'm going to hell.
[02:56:27.578 --> 02:56:29.179]  Yeah, I still pay to kill babies though.
[02:56:29.239 --> 02:56:29.520]  Really?
[02:56:29.780 --> 02:56:30.160]  Oh yeah.
[02:56:31.141 --> 02:56:32.502]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[02:56:33.363 --> 02:56:34.023]  I pay for them.
[02:56:34.624 --> 02:56:37.186]  Yeah, how many do you pay for them?
[02:56:37.346 --> 02:56:37.726]  Upwards of 50.
[02:56:37.826 --> 02:56:38.006]  Really?
[02:56:38.106 --> 02:56:38.747]  Oh yeah.
[02:56:38.827 --> 02:56:40.929]  Wow, you must make a lot of money.
[02:56:40.949 --> 02:56:42.470]  I raise money from the community for it.
[02:56:42.730 --> 02:56:43.911]  Oh, you don't use your money?
[02:56:45.186 --> 02:56:46.407]  Multiply your efforts, huh?
[02:57:07.237 --> 02:57:09.939]  I don't care what color a baby is.
[02:57:10.419 --> 02:57:13.402]  My soul won't allow me to hate somebody because of what color they are.
[02:57:13.742 --> 02:57:16.584]  Because I know I'll be destroyed if I ever go that direction.
[02:57:17.225 --> 02:57:18.266]  And so that's where I stand.
[02:57:18.306 --> 02:57:19.807]  That's why I wanted to have this meeting with you.
[02:57:20.047 --> 02:57:21.788]  Because you already tell people a lot of great things.
[02:57:21.808 --> 02:57:23.750]  And I know you reach tens of millions.
[02:57:24.190 --> 02:57:29.274]  But if you, which you've already done, magnify exposing what's in the vaccines.
[02:57:29.455 --> 02:57:31.716]  They've caught them in Africa and India with the sterilisers.
[02:57:31.736 --> 02:57:32.197]  You know that.
[02:57:32.677 --> 02:57:35.559]  If you expose the abortion, which I know you do.
[02:57:36.340 --> 02:57:37.500]  And said, you know what?
[02:57:37.600 --> 02:57:39.381]  Somebody kills you and gets away with it.
[02:57:39.421 --> 02:57:40.201]  They need to be dealt with.
[02:57:40.281 --> 02:57:40.641]  I agree.
[02:57:40.921 --> 02:57:43.882]  Well, what about what's going on in these abortuaries?
[02:57:44.002 --> 02:57:45.382]  What about Planned Parenthood?
[02:57:45.722 --> 02:57:46.903]  What about what's happening there?
[02:57:48.183 --> 02:58:01.526]  When I was on the mall a few weeks ago in Washington, I talked about my mom and I talked about the circumstances around my birth.
[02:58:03.046 --> 02:58:05.867]  And my mother knew that if I came to birth,
[02:58:06.992 --> 02:58:29.087]  I could disrupt her relationship with the man that she was with, because my father, whom she married, and he was a handsome philanderer, so she got rid of him, but he came back on the scene, and she was pregnant with me.
[02:58:30.488 --> 02:58:32.650]  The man, my mother's very dark,
[02:58:35.275 --> 02:58:37.937]  Unfortunately, we have to interrupt this because the end of the hour.
[02:58:37.957 --> 02:58:39.739]  We'll be back in 70 seconds after the break.
[02:58:39.759 --> 02:58:40.740]  We're going to back that up.
[02:58:41.061 --> 02:58:42.942]  This brought a tear to my eye when he told this story.
[02:58:43.303 --> 02:58:45.245]  His mother tried to abort him three times.
[02:58:45.645 --> 02:58:46.686]  Fourth hour straight ahead.
[02:58:46.726 --> 02:58:48.448]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:48.828 --> 02:58:50.110]  Trying to bring people together.
[02:58:50.770 --> 02:58:52.512]  Trying to expose the bigger agenda.
[02:58:52.872 --> 02:58:53.954]  The war against humanity.
[02:58:58.743 --> 02:59:01.945]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[02:59:02.245 --> 02:59:07.528]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[02:59:07.828 --> 02:59:15.733]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[02:59:16.193 --> 02:59:21.856]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[02:59:22.336 --> 02:59:27.319]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[02:59:27.379 --> 02:59:31.121]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:59:31.421 --> 02:59:33.822]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire.
[02:59:33.882 --> 02:59:34.202]  We're good.
[03:00:01.090 --> 03:00:17.459]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:17.579 --> 03:00:21.501]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:22.421 --> 03:00:27.324]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:36.810 --> 03:00:41.594]  You know, David Knight has got a story he's about to cover that is so big.
[03:00:44.437 --> 03:00:46.219]  And I just hope it's not overshadowed.
[03:00:48.852 --> 03:00:57.174]  By some of the people that have taken over some of the federal buildings, being arrested, driving around in the federal vehicles, going to the grocery store, people on TV begging for snacks.
[03:00:58.855 --> 03:01:02.976]  When they run stunts, mailing sex toys to them, they pull them out and wave them around on TV.
[03:01:03.116 --> 03:01:05.217]  I mean, it is just a disaster.
[03:01:06.137 --> 03:01:10.198]  And I supported the Bundys and their grazing rights in Nevada.
[03:01:11.618 --> 03:01:13.679]  And our reporters were there when they were threatened to shoot them.
[03:01:17.222 --> 03:01:26.330]  And then I just see this whole circus that it has become and then meanwhile we have footage that's gotten no attention.
[03:01:26.370 --> 03:01:38.822]  It went up on Infowars.com and there's just hours of this at retirement parties for BLM people where they're literally giving awards out for people that took more land from people and bragging about it.
[03:01:42.062 --> 03:01:44.744]  Quotes like, we're the bad guys, we come in and take this land.
[03:01:45.364 --> 03:01:57.951]  So you get that, like, the Bundys are like heroes making a stand, but they're doing it from not the best position, not the best place, wide open, with all these weird homeless people and stuff.
[03:01:58.051 --> 03:02:05.696]  There's a whole trend of, like, homeless people that say they're militia, which, fine, all men are militia, you know, going around and then just basically freeloading around.
[03:02:05.716 --> 03:02:07.296]  And it's just, it's a disaster.
[03:02:10.802 --> 03:02:14.045]  And there's obviously Fed swinging from the chandeliers.
[03:02:14.085 --> 03:02:15.826]  I mean, it is really a provocation.
[03:02:16.466 --> 03:02:17.467]  And I don't think they're bad people.
[03:02:17.487 --> 03:02:18.828]  They're just walking into a disaster.
[03:02:21.871 --> 03:02:22.551]  That's coming up.
[03:02:22.611 --> 03:02:24.833]  I mean, the footage is unbelievable.
[03:02:25.013 --> 03:02:28.936]  And towards the end of the fourth hour, he's going to play another segment of the Farrakhan interview.
[03:02:28.956 --> 03:02:31.918]  But the full interview is now up on Infowars.com.
[03:02:32.739 --> 03:02:34.460]  Louis Farrakhan, angel or devil?
[03:02:35.301 --> 03:02:38.804]  Alex Jones, Honorable Minister of Farrakhan, breakdown of the globalist enslave us all.
[03:02:40.219 --> 03:02:43.763]  And again, if you don't put something up there that asks a question, nobody will watch the video.
[03:02:43.783 --> 03:02:45.685]  I don't even know about the sub-headline.
[03:02:46.245 --> 03:02:49.188]  This is a powerful, historic interview that breaks the mold.
[03:02:49.729 --> 03:02:50.590]  I think that's the sub-headline.
[03:02:50.610 --> 03:02:51.431]  I'm not knocking, folks.
[03:02:51.471 --> 03:02:52.311]  I didn't tell them what to write.
[03:02:52.692 --> 03:02:53.873]  I just think, you know, powerful.
[03:02:54.594 --> 03:03:01.140]  In this powerful, unprecedented interview, Alex Jones breaks the mold of interviewing Louis Farrakhan.
[03:03:02.119 --> 03:03:06.261]  Instead of just going in there and trying to get in a fight with him and have more balkanization.
[03:03:06.641 --> 03:03:07.641]  I say what I disagree with.
[03:03:07.961 --> 03:03:08.742]  I say what I agree with.
[03:03:08.782 --> 03:03:09.202]  It's powerful.
[03:03:09.222 --> 03:03:14.524]  I'm not going to have time to get to all this because when he comes back we'll play it later in the hour.
[03:03:14.564 --> 03:03:18.045]  But the part about the abortion and how his mother tried to abort him three times.
[03:03:18.265 --> 03:03:19.986]  Let's see if we have time to get to it before we go to break.
[03:03:20.006 --> 03:03:20.346]  Here it is.
[03:03:21.327 --> 03:03:24.028]  What about what's going on in these abortuaries?
[03:03:24.168 --> 03:03:25.528]  What about Planned Parenthood?
[03:03:25.868 --> 03:03:27.009]  What about what's happening there?
[03:03:28.328 --> 03:03:35.391]  When I was on the mall a few weeks ago in Washington, I talked about my mom.
[03:03:36.892 --> 03:03:41.674]  And I talked about the circumstances around my birth.
[03:03:43.194 --> 03:03:52.458]  And my mother knew that if I came to birth, I could disrupt her relationship with the man that she was with.
[03:03:53.179 --> 03:03:56.220]  Because my father, whom she married,
[03:03:57.282 --> 03:04:01.105]  And he was a handsome philanderer.
[03:04:01.686 --> 03:04:03.347]  So she got rid of him.
[03:04:04.248 --> 03:04:05.969]  But he came back on the scene.
[03:04:07.450 --> 03:04:09.212]  And she was pregnant with me.
[03:04:10.613 --> 03:04:12.834]  The man, my mother's very dark.
[03:04:14.796 --> 03:04:19.760]  And the man that gave my mother her first child is very dark.
[03:04:20.961 --> 03:04:22.942]  So my brother's dark.
[03:04:23.483 --> 03:04:26.065]  But my father was light-skinned.
[03:04:27.310 --> 03:04:28.110]  Curly-haired.
[03:04:29.871 --> 03:04:40.174]  So she was afraid that if that baby came to birth and was light-skinned, it would destroy her relationship with that man.
[03:04:40.614 --> 03:04:42.555]  So she decided to abort me.
[03:04:44.015 --> 03:04:48.516]  And she tried three times to abort me.
[03:04:48.636 --> 03:04:53.698]  And on the third time, in those days, she used a hanger
[03:04:54.964 --> 03:04:56.546]  And she was unsuccessful.
[03:04:56.627 --> 03:04:58.770]  Folks, I mean again, this is breaking the mold.
[03:04:58.930 --> 03:05:00.252]  It's a very powerful interview.
[03:05:00.292 --> 03:05:01.554]  Help it go viral right now.
[03:05:01.614 --> 03:05:03.316]  The system does not want this info out.
[03:05:03.697 --> 03:05:06.361]  InfoWars.com right now.
[03:05:09.212 --> 03:05:11.915]  Will you enter the Matrix or fight its construction?
[03:05:12.455 --> 03:05:21.303]  As the World Economic Forum underway in Davos fantasizes about a future that doesn't need us, they openly talk about the imposition of new technologies to control us.
[03:05:21.784 --> 03:05:29.911]  The admission, for example, that driverless cars will be used as surveillance tools, with CEO Rob Leslie saying, availability and resolution of imaging
[03:05:29.991 --> 03:05:35.014]  ...from satellites, drones, and self-driving cars will continue to increase exponentially.
[03:05:35.334 --> 03:05:40.617]  In other words, these robot cars will be surveillance tools like satellites and drones.
[03:05:41.138 --> 03:05:53.045]  The Federal Department of Transportation is expected to create legislation outside of Congress's involvement this year to regulate communication equipment on cars that would communicate vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure.
[03:05:53.465 --> 03:05:57.771]  Detroit projects this to be a 46 billion dollar market in just four years.
[03:05:58.192 --> 03:06:01.697]  Or put another way, the price of cars is about to soar.
[03:06:01.957 --> 03:06:05.783]  Corporate profits and government surveillance, a match made in hell.
[03:06:06.023 --> 03:06:07.565]  This is David Knight for InfoWars.com
[03:06:08.442 --> 03:06:12.126]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male and then when super female came out.
[03:06:12.186 --> 03:06:12.726]  Tell us what happened.
[03:06:13.087 --> 03:06:17.711]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[03:06:17.851 --> 03:06:18.893]  Talk about the effects.
[03:06:19.193 --> 03:06:20.674]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[03:06:20.694 --> 03:06:22.316]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[03:06:22.636 --> 03:06:23.697]  I feel like I look better.
[03:06:23.737 --> 03:06:24.398]  I feel better.
[03:06:24.458 --> 03:06:25.539]  I feel sexier.
[03:06:25.860 --> 03:06:26.240]  I love it.
[03:06:26.480 --> 03:06:29.381]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[03:06:29.441 --> 03:06:32.162]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.

[03:08:10.373 --> 03:08:12.561]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:13.143 --> 03:08:15.933]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:28.655 --> 03:08:34.039]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Thursday, uh, Wednesday, January the 20th, 2016.
[03:08:34.159 --> 03:08:35.920]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:08:36.080 --> 03:08:37.601]  I'll be here the rest of this hour.
[03:08:38.141 --> 03:08:41.043]  We're going to play another clip from Louis Farrakhan.
[03:08:41.103 --> 03:08:48.348]  To finish that up, I have some amazing news, as Alex has been telling you, a retirement party a few years ago.
[03:08:48.548 --> 03:08:58.015]  We have the article up on InfoWars.com by Don Salazar that's, I think it's gone live now, but it's going to be coming up if it's not up there.
[03:08:58.795 --> 03:09:04.359]  Basically, what they're talking about is they're celebrating this lady they call the Acquisition Queen.
[03:09:05.139 --> 03:09:12.064]  They brag about all the land that she's taken, how much land she has taken for, and I'm not sure if it's the Park Service or the BLM.
[03:09:12.084 --> 03:09:13.785]  Look, they all work for the Department of Interior.
[03:09:13.805 --> 03:09:15.226]  They all work for the federal government.
[03:09:15.896 --> 03:09:24.542]  The VLM has different parts of its organization, some of them that confiscate land, some of them that supposedly manage land.
[03:09:24.763 --> 03:09:26.424]  That's questionable as we see this.
[03:09:26.964 --> 03:09:31.207]  But what you need to understand is the attitude of these bureaucrats.
[03:09:31.227 --> 03:09:33.069]  You know, as I looked at this, I thought,
[03:09:33.689 --> 03:09:39.473]  Have you ever wondered if there's any remorse or any regret from the people when they throw people out of their homes?
[03:09:40.454 --> 03:09:50.342]  And actually, when I look at this and the applause and the laughing and the taunting of private ownership that goes on in this retirement party, but no, they don't.
[03:09:50.982 --> 03:09:54.124]  As a matter of fact, they want more people to take more land.
[03:09:54.665 --> 03:10:01.190]  Because even though this lady, as she was retiring from this one position, she was going to go out to Lassen Park in California,
[03:10:01.909 --> 03:10:05.733]  And they were talking about how many acres were owned there by the Park Service.
[03:10:06.333 --> 03:10:15.061]  And they said, and in this area, there's another five acres out of, compared to the 106,000 acres that are there.
[03:10:15.361 --> 03:10:21.247]  In other words, there is five one thousandth of a percent private land.
[03:10:22.284 --> 03:10:27.949]  And the guy who talks about this says, well, if I was that private landowner, I'd be concerned about this.
[03:10:28.189 --> 03:10:29.490]  We're going to play you those clips.
[03:10:29.770 --> 03:10:31.392]  It will make your blood boil.
[03:10:31.452 --> 03:10:32.373]  It makes my blood boil.
[03:10:32.713 --> 03:10:35.415]  This is what our government is doing, as we've seen many times.
[03:10:36.096 --> 03:10:41.801]  The people who are fighting this out west, the people who have seen, and again in Utah, there was a
[03:10:43.062 --> 03:10:51.369]  A demonstration held by a county commissioner that he organized as the Park Service was going to shut down a trail that had been open to recreational vehicles.
[03:10:51.869 --> 03:10:56.613]  You know, a lot of people in the city, a lot of people in the suburbs don't really understand what's going on with the ranchers.
[03:10:57.414 --> 03:11:06.021]  They think, well, I want to have these massive parks, and understand that they're only going to let you use far less than 1% of this land.
[03:11:06.041 --> 03:11:07.282]  They're going to lock that up.
[03:11:07.723 --> 03:11:08.824]  And now they're locking down the 1%.
[03:11:10.405 --> 03:11:12.165]  And so they organized a protest.
[03:11:12.225 --> 03:11:13.946]  They threw the guy in jail for 10 days.
[03:11:14.006 --> 03:11:14.566]  They fined him.
[03:11:14.606 --> 03:11:16.666]  I think it was... I can't remember.
[03:11:16.686 --> 03:11:17.666]  I'm trying to go from memory.
[03:11:17.706 --> 03:11:21.147]  I think it was $100,000, $200,000 fine.
[03:11:21.807 --> 03:11:28.869]  And put him on probation because these people did a protest ride down this trail that had been previously open to the public.
[03:11:29.189 --> 03:11:30.329]  They want to shut everything down.
[03:11:30.389 --> 03:11:34.870]  As I said, they want to lock up all the land and tell you that you can't have any of it.
[03:11:35.945 --> 03:11:37.346]  It's absolutely amazing.
[03:11:37.386 --> 03:11:39.586]  This is what's going on with Agenda 21.
[03:11:39.646 --> 03:11:42.007]  They call this sustainable development.
[03:11:42.047 --> 03:11:52.211]  Sustainable development means that 99.9999, and I'm not exaggerating, percent of the land in this country will be locked up and off-limits to you.
[03:11:52.551 --> 03:12:01.194]  And you will be crammed into some congested cities that you can't even imagine what it's going to be like living in them with one 200 square foot apartments.
[03:12:02.034 --> 03:12:03.655]  That's their plan for the future.
[03:12:22.489 --> 03:12:23.950]  Our rights in and of themselves.
[03:12:24.050 --> 03:12:25.030]  Those are things that they had.
[03:12:25.070 --> 03:12:30.333]  They had done developments to that with water rights as well as grazing rights.
[03:12:30.613 --> 03:12:31.974]  They had developed water features.
[03:12:32.054 --> 03:12:35.396]  The BLM was going and destroying those confiscating their cattle.
[03:12:36.764 --> 03:12:39.086]  Literally not trying to manage the area.
[03:12:39.106 --> 03:12:41.688]  And that was, that was Cliven Bundy's point.
[03:12:42.368 --> 03:12:45.231]  That's when he stopped paying the fees in protest.
[03:12:45.271 --> 03:12:46.311]  And that's a legitimate thing.
[03:12:46.331 --> 03:12:49.494]  They want to call him a welfare king rancher, okay?
[03:12:50.074 --> 03:12:51.515]  That's not what was going on.
[03:12:52.076 --> 03:12:54.878]  These people are the acquisition queens.
[03:12:55.018 --> 03:12:56.379]  The theft people.
[03:12:56.779 --> 03:12:58.260]  As one of them says, we're the bad guys.
[03:12:58.321 --> 03:12:59.982]  We come in and we take this land.
[03:13:00.657 --> 03:13:02.519]  They also brag about how they steal a mine.
[03:13:02.539 --> 03:13:03.600]  So we're going to play that.
[03:13:03.920 --> 03:13:12.689]  We're also going to play what Obama wants to do with smart guns as part of his executive plan on guns.
[03:13:12.729 --> 03:13:17.294]  He wants to force us to have smart guns that nobody really wants.
[03:13:17.694 --> 03:13:20.637]  There's absolutely no reason why you would want one of these things.
[03:13:20.657 --> 03:13:24.100]  There's other ways to address the issues that he wants to do, but of course
[03:13:24.761 --> 03:13:29.865]  There's a reason that they want to put out the smart gun technology, and you need to understand what's behind that.
[03:13:30.446 --> 03:13:38.612]  Before we get to those two stories, and before we play the Louis Farrakhan clip, I want to go over a couple of small but very insightful news features.
[03:13:38.713 --> 03:13:44.177]  For example, here's one with Chris Christie, the presidential candidate, the governor of New Jersey.
[03:13:44.257 --> 03:13:49.562]  He just signed into law a bill called the Right to Shovel.
[03:13:50.711 --> 03:13:52.613]  Let me tell you what these people are shoveling.
[03:13:52.633 --> 03:13:53.754]  Okay?
[03:13:54.075 --> 03:13:54.735]  No, seriously.
[03:13:55.096 --> 03:14:07.408]  This is to establish a very narrow right for teenagers to be able to shovel snow for their neighbors and get paid a little bit of money without getting harassed by the cops.
[03:14:08.581 --> 03:14:09.402]  Isn't that pathetic?
[03:14:10.123 --> 03:14:10.784]  Isn't that pathetic?
[03:14:11.044 --> 03:14:12.626]  The police state of New Jersey.
[03:14:12.786 --> 03:14:15.929]  This is legislation sponsored by Senator Mike Dowery.
[03:14:16.290 --> 03:14:25.039]  He ensured that kids have the right to offer snow shoveling services before the storms without municipal approval and Governor Christie
[03:14:26.198 --> 03:14:28.199]  Magnanimously signed that into law.
[03:14:28.219 --> 03:14:33.022]  Look, you need to understand that it's not just for the ranchers.
[03:14:33.103 --> 03:14:34.684]  It's not just in the rural areas.
[03:14:34.744 --> 03:14:36.345]  It's not just in the suburban areas.
[03:14:37.025 --> 03:14:39.707]  We live in Sherwood Forest.
[03:14:40.487 --> 03:14:44.510]  And the Sheriff of Nottingham has locked this entire place up.
[03:14:44.570 --> 03:14:51.915]  And you can't do anything, no matter how minor, whether it's a lemonade stand or shoveling snow for your neighbors, you can't do anything.
[03:14:52.651 --> 03:14:55.452]  Unless the King expressly allows it.
[03:14:55.892 --> 03:14:59.493]  Otherwise, the Sheriff of Nottingham is going to come in and bust your head.
[03:15:00.114 --> 03:15:01.034]  Or lock you up in jail.
[03:15:01.194 --> 03:15:04.035]  Or maybe kill you if you get angry about the injustice.
[03:15:04.455 --> 03:15:05.035]  Here's what they said.
[03:15:05.335 --> 03:15:14.699]  He said, it's incredible that some towns wanted kids to register at business or to buy expensive solicitation permits before offering to shovel their neighbors' driveways and sidewalks.
[03:15:14.819 --> 03:15:15.659]  Absolutely, I agree with him.
[03:15:15.719 --> 03:15:17.099]  This is the senator who put the law in.
[03:15:17.400 --> 03:15:18.220]  He says this new law
[03:15:18.880 --> 03:15:25.844]  ...sends the message that kids looking to make a few bucks on a snow day shouldn't be subjected to government red tape or fined for shoveling snow.
[03:15:25.884 --> 03:15:33.288]  And he tweets out, my right to shovel bill was signed into law by Governor Christie just in time for a big snowstorm expected this weekend.
[03:15:34.113 --> 03:15:37.315]  I don't want to criticize this senator too much because he did the right thing.
[03:15:37.955 --> 03:15:48.381]  But when I look at this, I think about this and how pathetic, how pathetic that we have to have a law passed to say that we have a right to do something.
[03:15:48.601 --> 03:15:53.124]  Because you understand, they have completely perverted everything this country is about.
[03:15:54.096 --> 03:15:55.277]  It's not a free country anymore.
[03:15:55.337 --> 03:15:56.617]  We used to say that when I was a kid.
[03:15:56.877 --> 03:15:57.298]  Can I do this?
[03:15:57.358 --> 03:15:58.158]  Hey, it's a free country.
[03:15:58.438 --> 03:15:59.699]  You ever hear anybody say that anymore?
[03:16:00.099 --> 03:16:00.259]  No.
[03:16:01.120 --> 03:16:04.762]  I noticed it gradually got taken over by the idea, hey, there ought to be a law.
[03:16:04.782 --> 03:16:06.402]  Then there ought to be a federal law.
[03:16:07.023 --> 03:16:12.165]  And now everything we do in this country is a privilege that is granted by government.
[03:16:12.225 --> 03:16:17.828]  We take the position that everything is denied to us unless expressly permitted.
[03:16:18.248 --> 03:16:21.310]  And so you can't even have a right to shovel.
[03:16:21.330 --> 03:16:22.671]  You have to have express
[03:16:23.451 --> 03:16:26.995]  Uh, permission from the government to shovel snow as a teenager.
[03:16:27.515 --> 03:16:38.126]  They say this was drafted in response to reports of a pair of high school seniors who were stopped in January last year by bound brook police, told they could not go door to door without a permit.
[03:16:38.687 --> 03:16:44.132]  They couldn't hand out flyers in an attempt to solicit snow shoveling business for a snow storm the next morning.
[03:16:45.202 --> 03:17:05.335]  Well, you know, as he points out, in this law, it says, no ordinance regulating solicitation for services shall be applicable to solicitations, whether written or oral, for snow shoveling services made within 24 hours of a snowstorm that has been predicted by a commonly recognized commercial or governmental weather reporting entity.
[03:17:05.535 --> 03:17:06.035]  How about this?
[03:17:06.676 --> 03:17:11.338]  Instead of that long, legal, boring, opaque definition that I just read to you,
[03:17:12.279 --> 03:17:15.503]  Why don't we fire these cops who harass the kids?
[03:17:16.103 --> 03:17:20.348]  Why don't we say, you've got too many police in your department with nothing to do?
[03:17:20.988 --> 03:17:24.312]  We don't need to be paying taxes to support their salaries.
[03:17:24.692 --> 03:17:25.693]  Send them home.
[03:17:25.733 --> 03:17:26.654]  There's too many cops.
[03:17:26.995 --> 03:17:27.956]  They have nothing to do.
[03:17:28.396 --> 03:17:34.222]  And when I look about this narrow definition of freedom, where we have to have a special bill,
[03:17:35.137 --> 03:17:43.960]  Introduced into the legislature, signed by the governor to allow us to shovel snow without being harassed by the Sheriff of Nottingham.
[03:17:45.360 --> 03:17:51.602]  I'm reminded of this quote that I think about all the time of George Washington, when they asked him about the British.
[03:17:51.662 --> 03:17:54.322]  As they talk about liberty, aren't the British people free?
[03:17:55.163 --> 03:17:59.444]  He said, they walk about freely, but between high walls.
[03:18:00.728 --> 03:18:02.269]  We walk about between high walls.
[03:18:02.289 --> 03:18:08.371]  We walk about between very narrow alleyways of permitted freedoms.
[03:18:08.972 --> 03:18:09.692]  Isn't it pathetic?
[03:18:10.212 --> 03:18:13.914]  Isn't it pathetic in this land of the free that we stand for this?
[03:18:14.614 --> 03:18:20.417]  And before we go to break, I want to read you this other example of overstep and one of the corrections for this.
[03:18:20.657 --> 03:18:24.559]  We have a situation where we've got a Captain Edwards, who was then a police lieutenant,
[03:18:25.450 --> 03:18:32.077]  Flipped out when he put on his emergency lights, but not his siren, and a motorcyclist didn't pull over for three minutes.
[03:18:32.097 --> 03:18:36.201]  And the motorcyclist said, well, you can't turn around 100% behind you when you're riding a motorcycle.
[03:18:36.401 --> 03:18:39.944]  For one, you don't want to do that because you take your eyes off the road.
[03:18:40.004 --> 03:18:42.066]  The mirror on the motorcycle vibrates.
[03:18:42.467 --> 03:18:45.209]  His car was an undercover car with low-profile lights.
[03:18:45.249 --> 03:18:47.552]  When I found out it was getting pulled over, I pulled over.
[03:18:48.340 --> 03:18:56.027]  And of course, you can see, if you look at this picture of this, it's got a small red and white, uh, red and blue lights located in the grill, along with a small light at the top of the windshield.
[03:18:56.748 --> 03:19:00.851]  Now, with his turn signal activated, he pulls over in their shoulder rope, puts his feet on the ground.
[03:19:00.871 --> 03:19:13.783]  At this point, the policeman rams his 2006, uh, sport bike with his, with his new, the new Camaro police car, knocking the motorcyclist over, causing damage to the front end of the new Camaro.
[03:19:14.758 --> 03:19:16.979]  He nearly took my leg off, said the motorcyclist.
[03:19:17.279 --> 03:19:19.980]  On a dial clock, 12 o'clock facing forward, he hit me about 7.30.
[03:19:20.980 --> 03:19:23.581]  When you have your foot on a peg on a motorcycle, it's at about 8.30.
[03:19:24.682 --> 03:19:27.262]  So he quickly stood up, had his arms extended, palms up.
[03:19:27.482 --> 03:19:31.604]  The policeman jumps out of his vehicle with his gun pointed at this guy.
[03:19:32.184 --> 03:19:33.765]  Total road rage.
[03:19:34.045 --> 03:19:35.245]  Total out of control.
[03:19:35.585 --> 03:19:36.806]  Total Barney Fife.
[03:19:37.657 --> 03:19:39.618]  Then he yelled to get down on the ground.
[03:19:40.359 --> 03:19:51.406]  This guy, it took him a second or so because he has his helmet on, didn't do it quickly enough so he gave him a karate kick to the chest and broke his ribs or something.
[03:19:51.446 --> 03:19:53.188]  Nevertheless, a jury
[03:19:53.928 --> 03:19:54.709]  Did something about it.
[03:19:54.749 --> 03:19:57.373]  The district attorney didn't bring charges.
[03:19:57.433 --> 03:19:59.456]  This guy was promoted from lieutenant to captain.
[03:19:59.716 --> 03:20:03.041]  But a jury fined him, personally, $180,000.
[03:20:03.461 --> 03:20:06.385]  That's why you have juries.
[03:20:06.806 --> 03:20:08.428]  That's where we need to take our power back.
[03:20:08.448 --> 03:20:09.390]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[03:24:22.450 --> 03:24:33.056]  Now, as promised, we're going to play you this amazing clip from this retirement party for a federal bureaucrat, the people who are in land acquisition.
[03:24:33.096 --> 03:24:35.938]  And again, it's part of the Park Service.
[03:24:35.958 --> 03:24:37.499]  She's a Park Service employee.
[03:24:38.279 --> 03:24:39.580]  All under the Department of Interior.
[03:24:39.600 --> 03:24:41.922]  They all work with the Bureau of Land Management.

[03:24:48.287 --> 03:24:53.150]  You've got the people right here who are stealing the land from people and locking it up.
[03:24:53.190 --> 03:24:54.672]  So we're going to play you some of these clips.
[03:24:54.712 --> 03:24:55.912]  You will not believe this.
[03:24:56.013 --> 03:24:59.135]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to let you know about some of the specials we've got this week.
[03:24:59.815 --> 03:25:05.359]  This week only, we have Survival Shield X2, our nascent iodine, and Super Male Vitality for 15% off.
[03:25:07.501 --> 03:25:10.983]  Just this week, these are two of the most essential products from InfoWars Life.
[03:25:11.583 --> 03:25:12.283]  I recommend these.
[03:25:12.343 --> 03:25:13.064]  I use them daily.
[03:25:13.184 --> 03:25:15.545]  Both of these have thousands of five-star reviews.
[03:25:15.985 --> 03:25:19.627]  Over 90% of reviewers say they would recommend these products to a friend.
[03:25:19.687 --> 03:25:24.809]  Now is the time to stock up on these while you can get them at 15% off at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:25:25.329 --> 03:25:31.412]  And also we have, don't forget, we have InfoWarsHealth.com, where you can get products like Tangy Tangerine 2.0.
[03:25:32.833 --> 03:25:35.396]  This is the lowest price you'll find available anywhere.
[03:25:35.496 --> 03:25:40.462]  Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0 is the most advanced multivitamin mineral complex to date.
[03:25:40.882 --> 03:25:44.707]  It provides you with the highest quality essential nutrients your body needs for optimal health.
[03:25:45.027 --> 03:25:47.430]  Also make sure to check out Pollen Burst Plus Berry.
[03:25:47.910 --> 03:26:00.523]  At Infowarshealth.com, it's the world's first energy drink that's powered by flower pollen that contains a blend of powerful antioxidants and other key nutrients, and it will wake you up naturally.
[03:26:00.663 --> 03:26:01.844]  Let me tell you, I've used that.
[03:26:02.425 --> 03:26:05.448]  Pollen burst is one way to wake yourself.
[03:26:05.468 --> 03:26:08.972]  You get some pollen burst and some brain force, and you're good to go.
[03:26:09.232 --> 03:26:10.814]  That's one of my favorite things to do.
[03:26:11.434 --> 03:26:14.675]  Okay, now let's get to this clip of the BLM stuff.
[03:26:14.695 --> 03:26:20.196]  This is coming from Lady Serena Catania, I think is the way to pronounce her name.
[03:26:20.216 --> 03:26:21.896]  She has a Sustaining America channel.
[03:26:23.017 --> 03:26:25.877]  We were sent this clip, a couple of different people sent this to us.
[03:26:26.317 --> 03:26:27.538]  I want to try to get her on.
[03:26:27.598 --> 03:26:29.598]  She's got a website, sustainingamerica.com.
[03:26:30.078 --> 03:26:32.599]  Talk to her a little bit more about the background of this.
[03:26:32.639 --> 03:26:38.020]  And of course, if you go to her YouTube channel, go to her website, you'll see some other
[03:26:39.105 --> 03:26:47.450]  Very heartbreaking videos about people who built their dream home, wanted to retire, close to a national park.
[03:26:48.110 --> 03:26:51.052]  And the national park comes in and takes their land.
[03:26:51.892 --> 03:27:01.018]  And this one video that she has, the lady says they had just built their dream home, they were working on this, and they were going to confiscate all of it.
[03:27:01.038 --> 03:27:02.959]  She asked him, well, what are you going to do with the home?
[03:27:03.766 --> 03:27:08.067]  They said, well, you know, some of the nicer ones, like yours, we won't tear down.
[03:27:08.587 --> 03:27:10.128]  We'll have park employees move into them.
[03:27:10.828 --> 03:27:12.568]  And it's like, oh, okay.
[03:27:12.609 --> 03:27:16.930]  So it's okay for the government bureaucrats to live in these homes.
[03:27:17.230 --> 03:27:27.953]  It's not an impact on the sustainability of the environment if a park employee or a federal employee steals this from you and lives in it, but you can't stay there.
[03:27:28.693 --> 03:27:31.156]  That's the reality that we live with, okay?
[03:27:31.757 --> 03:27:34.540]  So yeah, there's some heart-wrenching other videos that she has.
[03:27:35.180 --> 03:27:36.702]  She's gone around doing interviews with people.
[03:27:36.742 --> 03:27:41.167]  We're going to do the same thing here at InfoWars because we have to understand what this is about.
[03:27:41.886 --> 03:27:47.408]  This isn't just coming about the ranchers or the miners or the loggers, okay?
[03:27:47.448 --> 03:27:50.669]  They're coming after people with homes in the suburbs.
[03:27:50.709 --> 03:27:55.851]  And if you don't understand that these people have rights as well, you're going to lose your home as well.
[03:27:56.532 --> 03:28:07.576]  When you look at these massive forest fires that are happening on government land, it is because of a policy that puts a priority on locking people out of the land.
[03:28:07.616 --> 03:28:10.157]  It used to be they would allow people to come in and cut deadwood.
[03:28:10.797 --> 03:28:12.338]  Standing deadwood, falling deadwood.
[03:28:13.079 --> 03:28:16.461]  Okay, that was what would keep the forest fires down.
[03:28:16.722 --> 03:28:20.865]  By letting standing deadwoods, dead trees remain.
[03:28:21.345 --> 03:28:23.987]  By letting them remain on the ground after they fall.
[03:28:24.007 --> 03:28:25.988]  Without letting anybody pull these things out.
[03:28:26.729 --> 03:28:29.591]  That is causing massive devastation.
[03:28:29.891 --> 03:28:33.534]  As we talked about when we talked about the situation with the Hammond family.
[03:28:34.515 --> 03:28:39.659]  Here was a situation where that year in Oregon, three and a half million acres burned from wildfires.
[03:28:40.560 --> 03:28:44.302]  They tried to stop a wildfire that was going to destroy their property.
[03:28:44.362 --> 03:28:46.843]  They did a backfire to stop it.
[03:28:46.863 --> 03:28:48.283]  139 acres burned.
[03:28:48.684 --> 03:28:54.146]  And for that, the BLM called them arsonists and prosecuted them as terrorists.
[03:28:54.206 --> 03:29:00.229]  And by the way, the bureaucrat who did this, the prosecuting attorney,
[03:29:01.169 --> 03:29:01.710]  Who pushed that.
[03:29:02.310 --> 03:29:04.692]  Has some pretty massive personal problems.
[03:29:04.932 --> 03:29:07.314]  She wound up having to resign.
[03:29:07.694 --> 03:29:10.137]  Said she was suffering from PTSD.
[03:29:10.177 --> 03:29:14.680]  I don't know if she was a vet or if that was just the warfare she's conducting on the American people.
[03:29:14.720 --> 03:29:17.122]  Let me play this clip for you real quickly, give you a taste of this.
[03:29:17.503 --> 03:29:22.487]  But I did have a letter here from the Washington office.
[03:29:22.607 --> 03:29:27.311]  And what it says in the letter to Mary is thank you for all of your support
[03:29:28.656 --> 03:29:32.240]  And Mary has, and Dick, they have supported Lance.
[03:29:32.861 --> 03:29:36.806]  Lance isn't always supported, because we're the bad guys.
[03:29:36.866 --> 03:29:42.652]  We come in, and we take this land, and we always take it for less than it's worth.
[03:29:43.153 --> 03:29:48.219]  And I still talk to Washington and keep telling him, you need more staff.
[03:29:50.083 --> 03:29:50.283]  Yeah.
[03:29:50.523 --> 03:29:52.805]  Need more people to take land for less than it's worth.
[03:29:53.325 --> 03:29:54.065]  They're the bad guys.
[03:29:54.505 --> 03:29:55.326]  They're bragging about it.
[03:29:55.346 --> 03:29:57.387]  Stay with us, we've got more of that coming up.
[03:29:57.627 --> 03:29:58.528]  We're on the march.
[03:29:59.028 --> 03:30:00.629]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:01.549 --> 03:30:04.251]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.847 --> 03:30:22.839]  The Intelligence Community's Inspector General has just revealed to lawmakers that Hillary Clinton had classified documents above Top Secret on her private email server, in addition to over 1,300 other classified emails.
[03:30:23.259 --> 03:30:32.228]  Access to information in the Special Access Program is more highly restricted, more sensitive than Top Secret, because it would likely reveal the source, putting lives at risk.
[03:30:32.788 --> 03:30:39.830]  We're constantly told that our money, our rule of law, our liberties must all be sacrificed on the altar of national security.
[03:30:40.030 --> 03:30:45.052]  Hillary has violated the surveillance state's religion, and she needs to be burned at the stake.
[03:30:45.492 --> 03:30:47.353]  Orange is the new pantsuit, Hillary.
[03:30:47.593 --> 03:30:54.495]  But she's being investigated by Obama's Justice Department, and she has about as much chance of going to jail as a Chicago cop.
[03:30:54.735 --> 03:31:00.277]  If she gets away with these crimes, the fraud of the surveillance state will be inescapably obvious to all.
[03:31:03.716 --> 03:31:06.837]  For more information, go to InfoWars.com.
[03:31:06.857 --> 03:31:07.938]  I'm David Knight.

[03:32:12.672 --> 03:32:16.635]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[03:32:16.835 --> 03:32:21.599]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[03:32:38.030 --> 03:32:38.951]  BrainForce is here.
[03:32:39.151 --> 03:32:41.252]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:32:41.372 --> 03:32:46.096]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:32:46.356 --> 03:32:47.997]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[03:32:48.057 --> 03:32:49.498]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:32:49.638 --> 03:32:52.861]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:32:53.141 --> 03:32:54.942]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:32:55.102 --> 03:32:56.003]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[03:32:56.023 --> 03:32:56.983]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:32:57.224 --> 03:32:59.105]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[03:32:59.225 --> 03:33:04.809]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:33:21.630 --> 03:33:29.139]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:33:30.120 --> 03:33:34.025]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:34.485 --> 03:33:38.310]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:33:38.670 --> 03:33:40.232]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:41.153 --> 03:33:42.453]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:42.533 --> 03:33:44.734]  I'm David Knight, your host for the rest of this hour.
[03:33:45.474 --> 03:33:51.476]  We've been playing some excerpts from the retirement party for a Park Service employee, Mary Martin.
[03:33:51.536 --> 03:33:55.357]  She was going to be retiring from the Mojave Preserve, and she was going to be, though, transferring.
[03:33:55.397 --> 03:33:56.217]  Not really a retirement.
[03:33:56.597 --> 03:34:00.658]  She was going to be transferring, I guess, to the Lassen Volcanic Preserve in California.
[03:34:01.601 --> 03:34:08.169]  Now, as we just played in the last segment, they're bragging about the fact that they take land for less than it's worth.
[03:34:08.209 --> 03:34:12.074]  Let's play that little clip just one more time as a lead-in to what they're about to talk about next.
[03:34:17.890 --> 03:34:21.654]  And we take this land, and we always take it for less than it's worth.
[03:34:22.135 --> 03:34:25.759]  Yeah, they come in, they take this land, they always take it for less than it's worth.
[03:34:25.779 --> 03:34:32.727]  So here's an example from the same lady, at the same party, where they're going to brag about the fact that there was a mine that they wanted to take.
[03:34:33.147 --> 03:34:34.809]  They said they estimated it was $40 million.
[03:34:34.929 --> 03:34:36.851]  They eventually get it for two and a half
[03:34:37.412 --> 03:34:38.433]  Yeah, why are you here?
[03:34:38.453 --> 03:34:38.673]  Thieves.
[03:35:00.686 --> 03:35:02.868]  Dick calls and says we need to have a meeting.
[03:35:03.409 --> 03:35:05.090]  There's a line I want to acquire.
[03:35:05.410 --> 03:35:06.451]  I want to acquire this line.
[03:35:06.471 --> 03:35:07.412]  So okay.
[03:35:07.793 --> 03:35:09.955]  And so we have this meeting and I'm sitting there.
[03:35:09.995 --> 03:35:10.815]  Is that for Harry Reid?
[03:35:12.421 --> 03:35:13.842]  Well, what's the value?
[03:35:14.102 --> 03:35:17.044]  Do you have an idea what the value of this mine is?
[03:35:17.184 --> 03:35:18.625]  Yeah, around 40 million.
[03:35:18.865 --> 03:35:20.886]  Well, I came from D.C.
[03:35:21.106 --> 03:35:24.929]  lands, and I knew how much money was in the bank.
[03:35:25.289 --> 03:35:28.111]  I forget how long it took us to acquire it.
[03:35:28.151 --> 03:35:29.312]  It did take forever.
[03:35:29.352 --> 03:35:30.792]  We don't have enough money, let's just steal it.
[03:35:30.812 --> 03:35:32.754]  We went out to the mine,
[03:35:33.574 --> 03:35:38.418]  And the owners were two little guys that had been in the Second World War.
[03:35:38.699 --> 03:35:41.281]  This mine was in operation in the 40s.
[03:35:41.381 --> 03:35:43.503]  Yeah, so it's cool.
[03:35:43.663 --> 03:35:44.824]  You can get away with it.
[03:35:44.844 --> 03:35:45.945]  They're old guys.
[03:35:45.965 --> 03:35:47.466]  Take advantage of them.
[03:35:48.287 --> 03:35:50.308]  I swear it was.
[03:35:50.328 --> 03:35:52.930]  And Ralph Meinhan, our attorney, is going like this.
[03:35:53.071 --> 03:35:54.432]  We didn't know what to do.
[03:35:54.932 --> 03:35:56.613]  We called everybody in the country.
[03:35:56.714 --> 03:35:57.895]  Nobody knew what to do.
[03:35:57.955 --> 03:35:59.276]  Nobody wanted to touch it.
[03:36:00.111 --> 03:36:06.516]  But anyway, we did get it appraised, and we did acquire it for $2.5 million, which I stole the money from Washington.
[03:36:07.657 --> 03:36:08.257]  Yeah, great.
[03:36:08.417 --> 03:36:12.580]  She stole the money from Washington, and she got it for $2.5 million.
[03:36:13.541 --> 03:36:17.063]  Just a little over 5% of what they had appraised it as.
[03:36:17.284 --> 03:36:18.465]  Yeah, you're the bad guys.
[03:36:18.505 --> 03:36:19.966]  You come in and you take our land.
[03:36:21.022 --> 03:36:22.923]  and you take it for less than it's worth.
[03:36:23.583 --> 03:36:24.443]  That's the reality of it.
[03:36:24.803 --> 03:36:25.924]  Let's play this next clip.
[03:36:26.444 --> 03:36:34.487]  This is where they refer to her as the Acquisition Queen and this is the celebration again of this lady who's retiring from working at the Mojave Preserve.
[03:36:34.507 --> 03:36:44.451]  They're going to talk about how much land this Acquisition Queen has stolen and then they're going to look forward to what she's going to do at her next position in California.
[03:36:44.671 --> 03:36:45.271]  Let's play that clip.
[03:36:49.687 --> 03:36:50.867]  There are three red numbers.
[03:36:51.948 --> 03:36:56.130]  Some pretty big ones and one small one.
[03:36:56.410 --> 03:37:00.631]  And I don't know how to do this, but I guess we'll go start with the big one, the 111,500 acres.
[03:37:00.651 --> 03:37:03.632]  So he's playing a little game.
[03:37:03.652 --> 03:37:05.553]  He's having the people guess, what is this?
[03:37:06.293 --> 03:37:08.574]  Under the Acquisition Queens Regime.
[03:37:08.594 --> 03:37:12.456]  111,550 acres under the Acquisition Queens Regime.
[03:37:12.536 --> 03:37:13.196]  Oh, applause.
[03:37:13.296 --> 03:37:14.077]  Isn't that great?
[03:37:14.517 --> 03:37:15.177]  We love that.
[03:37:18.719 --> 03:37:19.380]  It's required 111,000 acres.
[03:37:19.420 --> 03:37:20.841]  What's that number?
[03:37:20.861 --> 03:37:23.343]  Okay, how about the next number?
[03:37:23.363 --> 03:37:26.365]  It's the private acres in Lassen.
[03:37:31.360 --> 03:37:31.880]  Ha ha ha.
[03:37:32.140 --> 03:37:32.681]  Hold it right there.
[03:37:32.701 --> 03:37:33.201]  Hold it right there.
[03:37:33.221 --> 03:37:33.741]  Hold it right there.
[03:37:33.821 --> 03:37:34.441]  Let me get this up.
[03:37:34.501 --> 03:37:35.142]  This is radio.
[03:37:35.702 --> 03:37:36.922]  Okay, so they put two numbers up.
[03:37:37.223 --> 03:37:38.163]  One is 5.66.
[03:37:38.463 --> 03:37:40.864]  The other is 106-some-odd-thousand acres.
[03:37:41.064 --> 03:37:42.205]  Okay, what are these two numbers?
[03:37:42.505 --> 03:37:48.307]  Well, the first one, the big one, 106,000 acres, that's the number of acres in the Lassen Volcanic Park Preserve, okay?
[03:37:48.787 --> 03:37:53.650]  And then he says, and then the small one, 5.66, that's the number, that's the amount of private land.
[03:37:54.010 --> 03:37:54.570]  Ha ha.
[03:37:54.910 --> 03:37:57.811]  Ha ha, says the Park Service employees.
[03:37:58.071 --> 03:37:59.012]  Go ahead, play the rest of this.
[03:38:00.094 --> 03:38:06.820]  If you owned those 5.66 acres, would you be sweating right now?
[03:38:07.380 --> 03:38:08.841]  That makes my blood boil.
[03:38:08.881 --> 03:38:10.382]  I don't know if you can hear that.
[03:38:10.443 --> 03:38:15.727]  He says, if you owned that 5.66 acres, would you be sweating right now?
[03:38:16.568 --> 03:38:24.074]  Because you see, they've already gotten all but five one thousandth of a percent of the land in that area.
[03:38:24.977 --> 03:38:25.837]  They want it all.
[03:38:26.558 --> 03:38:27.118]  They want it all.
[03:38:27.438 --> 03:38:32.701]  And you better be sweating, because the federal government is going to steal every last thing you've got.
[03:38:33.421 --> 03:38:35.282]  And these people are laughing about it.
[03:38:35.602 --> 03:38:37.563]  They're the thieves who work for the federal government.
[03:38:37.783 --> 03:38:39.104]  Makes my blood boil to see this.
[03:38:39.304 --> 03:38:46.648]  We've got the federal government in Texas moving the boundaries around the Red River for land that people have had for centuries.
[03:38:47.816 --> 03:38:50.741]  Telling them that they're going to steal their land, they're going to steal their homes.
[03:38:51.002 --> 03:38:54.948]  This is land that has been private land, it's been registered, they've been paying taxes on it.
[03:38:55.009 --> 03:38:56.531]  They're doing this everywhere, folks.
[03:38:56.852 --> 03:38:57.613]  You better wake up!
[03:38:58.302 --> 03:38:59.543]  They're going to take your stuff too.
[03:38:59.824 --> 03:39:05.670]  Whether they're going to pull you over the side of the road and take your car because, well, you know, war on drugs.
[03:39:05.690 --> 03:39:09.153]  I'm not going to wait and, you know, find you guilty for anything.
[03:39:09.193 --> 03:39:10.835]  I'm not going to even charge you with anything.
[03:39:10.875 --> 03:39:19.804]  I'm just going to charge your car with being maybe an accessory to my fantasy of it being connected and somehow to this illegal, unconstitutional war on drugs.
[03:39:19.824 --> 03:39:21.586]  And I'll just take your property, okay?
[03:39:21.846 --> 03:39:23.087]  Think about this, conservatives.
[03:39:23.427 --> 03:39:29.991]  If a government can take your land, they can take your car, they can take your plane, they can take anything, because you don't have any rights.
[03:39:30.491 --> 03:39:40.998]  And all these people who want to support this because they hate drugs, or all these people who want to support it on the left because they hate guns, understand the hole that you're digging yourself into.
[03:39:41.038 --> 03:39:43.880]  They're going to set you beside that hole and put a gun in your head.
[03:39:44.707 --> 03:39:47.928]  And pop it one off and push you in the hole and cover it up.
[03:39:47.988 --> 03:39:49.309]  That's what this is all about, folks.
[03:39:49.749 --> 03:39:53.331]  You want to give them these kinds of unconstitutional powers that they don't have.
[03:39:53.791 --> 03:39:58.313]  Conservatives, do you understand that this is a UN agenda, this war on drugs?
[03:39:58.333 --> 03:40:02.435]  Do you understand that it has been totally ineffective except to take your rights and your property?
[03:40:03.342 --> 03:40:13.005]  Alright, let's go to this Louis Farrakhan interview because it is important that people start to come together across the spectrum.
[03:40:13.685 --> 03:40:16.926]  People in rural areas need to come together with people in the cities.
[03:40:17.326 --> 03:40:18.867]  Black and white need to come together.
[03:40:18.887 --> 03:40:28.189]  We need to understand they're not serving us except in the sense of the Twilight Zone movie where you find out that to serve mankind is actually a menu.
[03:40:28.229 --> 03:40:29.990]  Let's play that Louis Farrakhan clip.
[03:40:30.646 --> 03:40:37.767]  That gave my mother, her first child is very dark, so my brother is dark.
[03:40:38.327 --> 03:40:42.968]  But my father was light-skinned, curly-haired.
[03:40:44.729 --> 03:40:55.011]  So she was afraid that if that baby came to birth and was light-skinned, it would destroy her relationship with that man.
[03:40:55.451 --> 03:40:57.331]  So she decided to abort me.
[03:40:58.863 --> 03:41:08.569]  And she tried three times to abort me, and on the third time, in those days, she used a hanger.
[03:41:09.810 --> 03:41:11.451]  And she was unsuccessful.
[03:41:13.072 --> 03:41:14.253]  And I came to birth.
[03:41:15.753 --> 03:41:22.017]  And I said that on the mall to all those people that were there, and to the millions who were watching.
[03:41:22.758 --> 03:41:27.621]  If my mother was successful in aborting me,
[03:41:29.929 --> 03:41:32.470]  What would the world have lost?
[03:41:33.830 --> 03:41:38.172]  Jesus was born under strange circumstances.
[03:41:39.052 --> 03:41:51.077]  And she had to be put away privily, as the Bible teaches, because if she were seen pregnant, the law was, where's the husband?
[03:41:51.377 --> 03:41:52.237]  Where's the father?
[03:41:52.277 --> 03:41:53.638]  Well, you say, Holy Ghost,
[03:41:54.850 --> 03:42:01.036]  But we know there's no human being born without the agency of a man.
[03:42:01.096 --> 03:42:01.816]  That's real.
[03:42:02.677 --> 03:42:05.500]  So they would have killed Mary.
[03:42:06.570 --> 03:42:12.173]  But her baby was the last prophet to the Jewish people, Jesus.
[03:42:13.253 --> 03:42:15.034]  I'm saying that to say this.
[03:42:15.915 --> 03:42:21.778]  Every prayer that we pray is answered through the womb of a woman.
[03:42:22.238 --> 03:42:26.920]  And a baby that was given a chance to live and to grow.
[03:42:27.381 --> 03:42:29.682]  And that's why we're against eugenics.
[03:42:31.138 --> 03:42:34.620]  Mr. Muhammad was death on birth control.
[03:42:34.940 --> 03:42:43.425]  He called it a death plan by the government against poor people.
[03:42:43.586 --> 03:42:52.231]  So, we find that we are kindred spirits in so many ways.
[03:42:53.051 --> 03:42:57.674]  And you know, Mr. Jones, I felt that today.
[03:42:59.135 --> 03:43:00.676]  I felt that when we met,
[03:43:02.225 --> 03:43:15.393]  And you could question me and strip away whatever there is, if there's something to be stripped away, that America could see me as I am.
[03:43:15.493 --> 03:43:18.195]  White people could see me as I am.
[03:43:43.211 --> 03:43:47.393]  How dare you put yourself in that position as a moral judge?
[03:43:47.753 --> 03:43:48.934]  I think you should keep quiet.
[03:43:49.374 --> 03:43:57.078]  In the mind of Satan was to set up a one world government where he would be in charge.
[03:43:57.138 --> 03:44:01.521]  They talk about me, but they won't confront me.
[03:44:01.561 --> 03:44:03.922]  What the hell business is it of yours?
[03:44:04.582 --> 03:44:06.243]  America should keep her mouth shut.
[03:44:11.744 --> 03:44:13.085]  I didn't mean to be so fiery.
[03:44:13.165 --> 03:44:13.925]  Oh, that's good.
[03:44:14.105 --> 03:44:14.506]  That's good.
[03:44:14.586 --> 03:44:15.526]  That's my passion.
[03:44:17.468 --> 03:44:22.831]  As a student of my teacher, I think I should always be dignified.
[03:44:24.494 --> 03:44:30.116]  In my expression, although sometimes in passion, I lose it.
[03:44:30.376 --> 03:44:30.936]  Absolutely.
[03:44:31.636 --> 03:44:51.403]  And so I thought about, you know, when they said Farrakhan, he wants to kill all white people and he's advocating 10,000 fearless men to go out and kill white people, as though I'm insane.
[03:44:52.483 --> 03:44:53.584]  That's insanity.
[03:44:54.750 --> 03:45:19.398]  And I've been teaching for 60 years, sir, and no one who follows me has ever gone out and killed a white person, harmed a Jewish person, bombed a synagogue, or even put some swastika on a synagogue, because that's against our religion to deface a house of worship.
[03:45:19.958 --> 03:45:21.599]  I'm saying that to say this.
[03:45:23.694 --> 03:45:32.643]  I, when I said in Florida, you know, naming all the blacks that got shot down,
[03:45:34.016 --> 03:45:51.803]  And according to something I just read, where one black man every 28 hours is shot by a policeman, and young black men are nine times more likely than other Americans to be killed by police officers in 2015.
[03:45:53.704 --> 03:46:06.492]  According to the findings of the Guardian newspaper, 1,134 deaths at the hands of law enforcement officers happened last year.
[03:46:07.993 --> 03:46:10.215]  As a black man who loves my people,
[03:46:12.105 --> 03:46:27.934]  I'm grieved, not only at police killing us, but I am grieved at our killing of each other, which sometimes is ten times more than what white policemen have done.
[03:46:28.875 --> 03:46:41.322]  So in my passion against that, and this has been gradually increasing with me over the years, I said, if the federal government
[03:46:42.546 --> 03:46:47.229]  does not intercede to see that justice comes to us.
[03:46:47.670 --> 03:46:50.592]  Because that's the government's job.
[03:46:50.952 --> 03:46:53.714]  It's not my job to kill my killer.
[03:46:54.214 --> 03:47:03.220]  It's the government's job to arrest the killer, bring them before a court of law, and punish them for their misdeed.
[03:47:03.520 --> 03:47:07.183]  But when the government fails to do it,
[03:47:08.160 --> 03:47:09.022]  What are we to do?
[03:47:09.743 --> 03:47:12.187]  We have to defend our lives.
[03:47:12.727 --> 03:47:18.236]  And so I said, stalk them wherever you find them.
[03:47:19.984 --> 03:47:37.077]  Everybody, just the ones that kill us out of the law of justice, if the government won't arrest them and do that, somehow we're gonna ultimately do that and then it leads to what they'll say.
[03:47:37.598 --> 03:47:38.698]  It's a race war?
[03:47:39.039 --> 03:47:39.299]  No.
[03:47:40.320 --> 03:47:42.982]  We are not in any position at all
[03:47:44.318 --> 03:47:53.164]  To engage in a race war, it's ridiculous, it's destructive, it's suicidal.
[03:47:53.844 --> 03:48:01.349]  However, persecution in the Quran, it says, is worse than slaughter.
[03:48:02.790 --> 03:48:05.452]  And you know, you talk about 1776.
[03:48:08.556 --> 03:48:09.476]  Hitler took the guns.
[03:48:09.737 --> 03:48:10.797]  Stalin took the guns.
[03:48:11.077 --> 03:48:11.957]  Mao took the guns.
[03:48:12.138 --> 03:48:13.458]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[03:48:13.598 --> 03:48:14.859]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[03:48:15.019 --> 03:48:20.321]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[03:48:20.481 --> 03:48:24.783]  Doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street, begging for them to have their guns taken.
[03:48:25.003 --> 03:48:26.304]  We will not relinquish them.
[03:48:26.524 --> 03:48:27.424]  Do you understand?
[03:48:27.444 --> 03:48:30.065]  And you are so right.
[03:48:31.366 --> 03:48:32.606]  But in 1776, America had enough.
[03:48:37.813 --> 03:48:43.156]  The colonial people under Britain had enough.
[03:48:44.417 --> 03:48:47.739]  So when Patrick Henry said, give us liberty,
[03:48:48.815 --> 03:48:51.918]  Or we are willing to pay the price, which is death.
[03:48:52.739 --> 03:49:03.790]  You force people into that when government fails to do its job to redress the grievance of the people who are suffering.
[03:49:04.090 --> 03:49:06.633]  I will put this interview out basically unedited.
[03:49:06.693 --> 03:49:11.077]  I mean, we'll put a lot of clips in and articles and things, but we're going to put almost the whole interview out basically.
[03:49:12.131 --> 03:49:21.727]  Mainstream media, they're gonna take just what you said, even though you quoted Patrick Henry and the rest of it, I guarantee you they're gonna take that and just show the clip again out of context.
[03:49:22.901 --> 03:49:29.067]  And I do that with me too, so I don't even, I'm asking you, how do we deal with that when there's nothing we can do?
[03:49:29.127 --> 03:49:33.151]  I guess mainstream media is losing credibility, losing ratings.
[03:49:33.191 --> 03:49:37.775]  Even USA Today a few weeks ago admitted television for politics is dead.
[03:49:37.795 --> 03:49:39.757]  It faces its mortality.
[03:49:40.418 --> 03:49:41.899]  So I think I just answered my question.
[03:49:42.080 --> 03:49:44.001]  They've discredited themselves, but still
[03:49:45.083 --> 03:49:47.904]  They just go on lying, they go on twisting.
[03:49:47.944 --> 03:49:49.744]  The talk show host is Alex Jones.
[03:49:49.764 --> 03:49:51.285]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[03:49:51.365 --> 03:49:54.085]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[03:49:54.305 --> 03:49:55.045]  Alex Jones.
[03:49:55.125 --> 03:49:56.146]  His name is Alex Jones.
[03:49:56.206 --> 03:49:59.086]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[03:49:59.306 --> 03:50:02.527]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[03:50:02.607 --> 03:50:04.548]  Alex Jones, the nut job radio guy.
[03:50:04.568 --> 03:50:06.108]  Talk show host Alex Jones.
[03:50:06.168 --> 03:50:11.489]  A man who trades in such sinister conspiracy theories, you have to wonder if he really believes half of what he says.
[03:50:11.609 --> 03:50:13.870]  I'm here to warn people, you keep telling me to shut up!
[03:50:14.170 --> 03:50:15.031]  This isn't a game!
[03:50:15.111 --> 03:50:15.833]  Hate speech.
[03:50:16.073 --> 03:50:18.056]  Can anything be done to stop the hatred?
[03:50:18.076 --> 03:50:22.462]  I think Alex was the one who took the pro-gun position.
[03:50:22.482 --> 03:50:24.104]  1776 will commence again if you try to take off-
[03:50:26.562 --> 03:50:28.403]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[03:50:28.543 --> 03:50:30.144]  Alex Jones is a 9-11 truther.
[03:50:30.304 --> 03:50:33.466]  That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories.
[03:50:33.586 --> 03:50:36.088]  It's an internet talk show called InfoWars.
[03:50:36.268 --> 03:50:38.509]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[03:50:39.210 --> 03:50:43.152]  Okay, and you can see the rest of this on the Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[03:50:43.192 --> 03:50:45.713]  We don't have time to play the entire Louis Farrakhan interview.
[03:50:46.054 --> 03:50:51.637]  It's a great job, a great documentary interview, as you just saw an excerpt there, one more excerpt.
[03:50:52.037 --> 03:50:55.380]  When we come back, we're going to talk about child-proof caps, airbags, smart guns.
[03:50:55.460 --> 03:50:57.182]  Obama says they're going to make us all safer.
[03:50:57.242 --> 03:50:57.502]  Do they?
[03:50:57.942 --> 03:50:58.503]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:09.525 --> 03:51:11.426]  My name is Don Whiskin.
[03:51:11.506 --> 03:51:15.768]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:16.468 --> 03:51:20.269]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:51:20.489 --> 03:51:21.610]  He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:22.050 --> 03:51:25.471]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:51:25.952 --> 03:51:30.413]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:51:30.714 --> 03:51:31.554]  He waited too long.
[03:51:31.974 --> 03:51:34.995]  In June, that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:51:35.335 --> 03:51:35.975]  What did I do?
[03:51:36.235 --> 03:51:43.478]  I took a 7-herb formula I now call ExtendoVite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle, and valerian.
[03:51:43.678 --> 03:51:51.861]  Based on German studies of natural medicine, ExtendoVite is designed to clear blocked arteries, clean the toxins from your blood, and improve your immune system.

[03:53:08.866 --> 03:53:10.267]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowicz.
[03:53:10.708 --> 03:53:12.670]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[03:53:13.230 --> 03:53:16.854]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[03:53:17.094 --> 03:53:25.562]  Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[03:53:25.922 --> 03:53:29.185]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[03:53:30.066 --> 03:53:33.148]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[03:53:33.188 --> 03:53:37.830]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[03:53:38.571 --> 03:53:42.813]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[03:53:43.494 --> 03:53:46.315]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[03:53:46.655 --> 03:53:48.957]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[03:53:49.757 --> 03:53:55.981]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallets, sleeves, or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.
[03:53:56.761 --> 03:54:02.025]  You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[03:54:02.365 --> 03:54:04.067]  It is as though the protection is free.
[03:54:04.747 --> 03:54:06.349]  Visit IDStronghold.com today.
[03:54:15.974 --> 03:54:17.496]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:17.576 --> 03:54:18.217]  I'm David Knight.
[03:54:18.277 --> 03:54:22.602]  In this last segment, we're going to talk about Obama's push for smart guns.
[03:54:22.642 --> 03:54:29.151]  And when he sells this, he sells it as one more thing that the government can do, like childproof caps or airbags.
[03:54:29.211 --> 03:54:31.173]  We're going to talk about those too, as well as
[03:54:31.834 --> 03:54:36.275]  I'm going to plug the report that we've got up on InfoWars.com about smart guns.
[03:54:36.655 --> 03:54:42.057]  Before I do, just quickly, I want to let you know that we have the all-new ProPure shower filter that has arrived.
[03:54:42.177 --> 03:54:44.638]  It's available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:54:44.658 --> 03:54:54.101]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants from shower water, including heavy metals, pesticides, fluoride, chlorine, pharmaceuticals and odors.
[03:54:54.181 --> 03:54:59.622]  It's made out of BPA-free plastic, easy to install, has a filtration capacity of up to nine months.
[03:55:00.102 --> 03:55:01.783]  It is available exclusively at InfoWars.com.
[03:55:01.803 --> 03:55:02.063]  I think so.
[03:55:28.052 --> 03:55:43.223]  Now, as Obama is selling smart guns, and I have an entire report about why people don't want smart guns, and why Obama desperately wants them, but as he's selling them, he's talking about how we've had these success stories with child-proof medicine bottles.
[03:55:43.483 --> 03:55:44.904]  Let me give you some metrics about that.
[03:55:45.825 --> 03:55:54.731]  We saw a 45% drop in the deaths of children under 5 years old when we put in these medicine bottle caps.
[03:55:55.728 --> 03:55:57.410]  That's not a large number, quite frankly.
[03:55:57.450 --> 03:56:00.653]  I was surprised that it didn't even reduce the fatalities by half.
[03:56:01.494 --> 03:56:09.343]  Understand that that saves 25 lives a year, but there's still 31 children a year dying from getting these caps.
[03:56:10.023 --> 03:56:16.110]  It's a pretty major movement to get these quote-unquote childproof bottles because, again, they're not childproof.
[03:56:17.091 --> 03:56:23.214]  This is, I would think, an example of straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel.
[03:56:23.875 --> 03:56:27.536]  Because it isn't the child-proof caps that are really the problem.
[03:56:27.817 --> 03:56:29.377]  It's the drugs inside of them.
[03:56:30.078 --> 03:56:34.280]  If you really want to save lives, you will seal these things up and not let people get to them.
[03:56:34.320 --> 03:56:43.525]  Because we had, for example, going back to the JAMA statistics of 1998, over 106,000 people died from regular use of prescription drugs.
[03:56:43.545 --> 03:56:44.385]  This is not overdose.
[03:56:44.465 --> 03:56:48.447]  The overdose killed another 30,000 people.
[03:56:48.467 --> 03:56:56.612]  4.6% of all deaths that year were from real, from adverse drug reaction, people using them as prescribed.
[03:56:56.752 --> 03:56:59.353]  So you really want to, you know, get rid of deaths.
[03:56:59.453 --> 03:57:07.518]  Don't just use child proof locks, which are only 45% effective, only save 25 years, 25 lives per year, but still 31 lives per year being lost to that.
[03:57:09.779 --> 03:57:14.064]  Then he goes on to talk about airbags as being another success story of government regulation.
[03:57:14.505 --> 03:57:15.366]  Here's an article from 2005.
[03:57:17.628 --> 03:57:24.370]  At the time, and this is a statistic that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration loves to put out, 10,000 lives a year saved.
[03:57:24.710 --> 03:57:25.710]  How do they justify that?
[03:57:25.810 --> 03:57:27.331]  I don't know where they get their statistics.
[03:57:27.711 --> 03:57:29.711]  But a statistician questioned that.
[03:57:30.472 --> 03:57:33.492]  This was Mary C. Meyer, who is at the University of Georgia.
[03:57:33.553 --> 03:57:35.073]  She did an article that was published.
[03:57:35.713 --> 03:57:40.454]  She said that NHTSA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, recorded 238 deaths
[03:57:42.691 --> 03:57:44.232]  From airbags between 1990 and 2002.
[03:57:44.672 --> 03:57:51.074]  And of course, you know, you've seen a lot of headlines about these malfunctioning airbags that have killed, I think, between 8 and 10 people.
[03:57:51.134 --> 03:57:52.595]  They've had millions of them recalled.
[03:57:52.615 --> 03:57:56.016]  When they go off, it shoots projectiles into your face.
[03:57:56.056 --> 03:57:57.897]  It's like being hit in the face with a shotgun.
[03:57:58.277 --> 03:57:59.497]  That's the way that thing fails.
[03:58:00.038 --> 03:58:03.259]  But she points out there's 238 deaths between 1990 and 2002.
[03:58:03.539 --> 03:58:05.760]  She said they all occurred at very low speed.
[03:58:06.340 --> 03:58:09.442]  And we know that they couldn't have been caused by anything other than airbags.
[03:58:09.462 --> 03:58:14.845]  But of course, NHTSA discounts the fact that people could die from the airbags at a high-speed crash.
[03:58:15.305 --> 03:58:19.207]  She points out, analysis found proper use of seatbelts reduced death by 67%.
[03:58:20.348 --> 03:58:26.892]  Airbags had no statistical difference except to increase your chances of dying by a factor of four.
[03:58:27.552 --> 03:58:28.993]  If you're not wearing seatbelts.
[03:58:29.714 --> 03:58:33.017]  That's what they offer us with their safety mandates.
[03:58:33.197 --> 03:58:34.178]  And now they've got another one.
[03:58:34.478 --> 03:58:36.019]  Lined up, smart guns.
[03:58:36.140 --> 03:58:37.120]  Take a look at that article.
[03:58:37.180 --> 03:58:38.822]  Smart guns, dumb and dumber.
[03:58:38.842 --> 03:58:41.744]  Tonight, InfoWars News, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
