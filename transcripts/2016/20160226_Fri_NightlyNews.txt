[00:00:19.648 --> 00:00:21.649]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:22.909]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.270]  It is February 26, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:32.242 --> 00:00:45.749]  Mexico's president, Vicente Fox, drops another F-bomb on Donald Trump and refuses to apologize for saying that he will not pay for that f***ing wall.
[00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:46.630]  No, I am not.
[00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.391]  And he should know that.
[00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:50.132]  He might not want to apologize.
[00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:57.416]  Then, follow Alex Jones to the voting booth as Americans cast their votes for Super Tuesday.
[00:00:57.876 --> 00:01:01.499]  Are you like a Rush Limbaugh type person?
[00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.741]  Well, it's more libertarian.
[00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:06.043]  But what we do is... You're not an Alex Jones person.
[00:01:06.063 --> 00:01:06.824]  Yes, I am Alex Jones.
[00:01:07.164 --> 00:01:14.611]  And Apple's attorney paints a scary Orwellian picture if they lose their fight with the FBI.
[00:01:15.071 --> 00:01:19.295]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:01.624]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:03.206]  You can't survive without it.
[00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:04.308]  But where do you get it?
[00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:10.375]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:16.302]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:33.360]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.881]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.441]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:38.501]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:39.362]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:39.662 --> 00:02:41.482]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:03:03.956 --> 00:03:09.242]  Last night we saw the GOP debate held right here in the state of Texas, and we will have some highlights coming up.
[00:03:09.282 --> 00:03:14.527]  But first, let's talk about the tidbits, the after-the-hours things, the interviews that went on.
[00:03:14.808 --> 00:03:20.093]  And we see Donald Trump is accusing the IRS of targeting him because of his religion and his politics.
[00:03:20.794 --> 00:03:26.478]  The one problem I have is that I'm always audited by the IRS, which I think is very unfair.
[00:03:26.538 --> 00:03:32.602]  I don't know, maybe because of religion, maybe because of something else, maybe because I'm doing this, although this is just recently.
[00:03:32.622 --> 00:03:33.282]  What do you mean, religion?
[00:03:33.763 --> 00:03:38.646]  Well, maybe because of the fact that I'm a strong Christian and I feel strongly about it and maybe there's a bias.
[00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:40.747]  You think maybe you get audited for being a strong Christian?
[00:03:40.767 --> 00:03:41.688]  Well, you see what's happened.
[00:03:41.728 --> 00:03:44.130]  I mean, you have many religious groups that are complaining about that.
[00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.811]  They've been complaining about it for a long time.
[00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:47.712]  So at least the ones that aren't audited.
[00:03:47.872 --> 00:03:49.213]  Just seems like an easy answer for you.
[00:03:49.433 --> 00:03:50.394]  No, I can't do that.
[00:03:50.974 --> 00:03:54.017]  And it's not just the IRS who has Donald Trump in their sights.
[00:03:54.377 --> 00:03:57.700]  We see the former Mexican President Fox.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.765]  He has come out and said that he's not going to build the effing wall, referring to the wall that Trump wants to build on the border.
[00:04:04.085 --> 00:04:07.568]  And he doubled down in an interview he did with Fox Business Network.
[00:04:08.368 --> 00:04:13.052]  I have to say we're not, I am not going to pay for that f***ing wall.
[00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:13.873]  I am not.
[00:04:14.551 --> 00:04:17.432]  And he should know that and I'm not going to apologize.
[00:04:17.792 --> 00:04:28.556]  On the contrary, a real public servant, Joe Biden, Vice President of the United States, he said in Mexico, I have to apologize for this guy.
[00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:31.637]  And this was always one of my issues with Donald Trump.
[00:04:31.677 --> 00:04:38.900]  One of my many issues with Donald Trump was that he wanted to build a wall that Mexico didn't want and wanted them to pay for it.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.602]  And that just never sat well in my mind.
[00:04:42.642 --> 00:04:47.705]  I was like, even if he is president, Bravado isn't going to pay for this wall to be built.
[00:04:48.085 --> 00:04:50.186]  Not to mention that he was going to build it himself.
[00:04:50.247 --> 00:04:54.969]  His, you know, Trump company, construction company, whatever it's called, was going to get paid to build the wall.
[00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:57.691]  Like, I just don't see that happening ever.
[00:04:58.111 --> 00:04:59.272]  But he continues to run on it.
[00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:00.633]  Some people think it's a good idea.
[00:05:00.673 --> 00:05:02.674]  I think a physical wall is a bad idea.
[00:05:03.074 --> 00:05:07.277]  I much prefer the immigration policy of somebody like John McAfee, but to each his own.
[00:05:07.717 --> 00:05:19.439]  Now we've seen the IRS, we've seen Mr. Fox, and now we have just regular demonstrators outside the University of Houston complex who also had very strong words against Donald Trump.
[00:05:23.846 --> 00:05:26.427]  Hello everybody!
[00:05:26.627 --> 00:05:28.248]  I'm Maria.
[00:05:28.368 --> 00:05:32.309]  I'm the one that's usually signing your abstention vote.
[00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:34.450]  Thank you for registering to vote.
[00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.631]  Don't forget to vote!
[00:05:35.871 --> 00:05:40.132]  I'm going to speed around here with our vote!
[00:05:40.232 --> 00:05:42.093]  See, I'm a history nerd.
[00:05:42.173 --> 00:05:46.635]  You all need a history nerd to tell you that what's going on right now is history.
[00:05:49.237 --> 00:05:51.485]  We are here to say that we will win!
[00:05:51.987 --> 00:05:53.492]  I believe that we will win!
[00:05:53.893 --> 00:05:54.957]  I believe that we will win!
[00:06:15.678 --> 00:06:17.299]  This isn't Russia, sir.
[00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:19.679]  You just illegally moved us.
[00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:23.280]  For the protection of you and the citizens, I have the right to remove you.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.680]  I was fine.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.941]  Why didn't you remove them?
[00:06:24.961 --> 00:06:25.281]  No, sir.
[00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:26.541]  They were there first.
[00:06:26.681 --> 00:06:28.362]  I'm standing in front of my own business.
[00:06:28.382 --> 00:06:29.682]  No, they were there first.
[00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:37.055]  And of course, Donald Trump is not the only person in the GOP.
[00:06:37.595 --> 00:06:38.515]  Also, Ted Cruz.
[00:06:39.016 --> 00:06:42.998]  Now, this goes back to a story that Watson did a few weeks ago.
[00:06:43.058 --> 00:06:45.759]  He's talking about modern art, or the lack thereof.
[00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:49.742]  You know, he went to a museum over there in the UK, and he was, you know, looking at the pieces on the wall.
[00:06:50.142 --> 00:06:51.482]  One of them was just a blank canvas.
[00:06:51.823 --> 00:06:55.905]  And then he got to a point where he said, hey, I'm gonna sit down on a chair, because I'm tired, my legs are stiff.
[00:06:55.925 --> 00:06:57.466]  You know, Watson's 6'5", or whatever he is.
[00:06:58.046 --> 00:06:59.207]  And he sat down on this chair.
[00:07:00.147 --> 00:07:03.128]  Only to be told that he was sitting on one of the works of art.
[00:07:03.668 --> 00:07:08.810]  Which is really notable to me because it was just a wicker chair that appeared to be spray painted orange.
[00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.231]  And now on that same type of modern art, I look at this article.
[00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:16.552]  A Florida man is to stare at Ted Cruz's mouth for two straight hours.
[00:07:16.892 --> 00:07:18.853]  And this man is a performance artist.
[00:07:19.573 --> 00:07:22.154]  And he says, this is the most dangerous thing I've ever done.
[00:07:22.174 --> 00:07:24.375]  It's like being caught in It's a Small World.
[00:07:24.815 --> 00:07:25.395]  For two hours.
[00:07:42.424 --> 00:07:47.887]  No, this is kind of like the sign of the times where you just go and you stare at a picture and this is supposed to be modern art.
[00:07:48.528 --> 00:07:49.588]  I really don't get it.
[00:07:49.808 --> 00:08:01.595]  And actually, I guess I can make a segment like this because I keep running into these stories that they're not the hardest hitting news stories of the day, but it is a sign of the times, kind of the degradation of society where staring at a picture could be considered, you know, art.
[00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:05.458]  You know, I think it's more art when Shia LaBeouf, you know, watched his movies.
[00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:10.721]  I think this kind of falls in the same category, but staring at that, you know, be considered some type of art.
[00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:12.663]  No, you actually have to do something.
[00:08:13.023 --> 00:08:16.587]  And speaking of doing something, Alex Jones is out there in the streets right now doing something.
[00:08:16.987 --> 00:08:20.971]  He is going out to vote for the local elections right here in the city of Austin.
[00:08:22.093 --> 00:08:24.175]  Let's go in here and see if I'm able to videotape voting.
[00:08:24.195 --> 00:08:25.456]  Everybody else can do it, but we'll see if we can.
[00:08:25.636 --> 00:08:26.217]  Come on.
[00:08:26.738 --> 00:08:28.038]  We'll see if anybody says anything to us.
[00:08:28.058 --> 00:08:30.799]  I try to tape stuff before when I go vote and make a big issue out of it.
[00:08:31.299 --> 00:08:32.920]  But obviously we're not talking about the election in here.
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.100]  We're not telling people who to vote for.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.821]  We do that to our huge audiences if we want to influence something here.
[00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:38.681]  Trump's probably going to get Texas.
[00:08:39.702 --> 00:08:42.202]  We're just here to document that I'm not voting for the first time in eight years.
[00:08:42.282 --> 00:08:43.623]  And I've made no excuse about that.
[00:08:43.643 --> 00:08:47.464]  I haven't really found a lot of good people I could vote for, you know, previous to that.
[00:08:49.444 --> 00:08:51.005]  And I mainly was trying to influence people.
[00:08:52.654 --> 00:08:54.336]  Well, I guess it wasn't eight years ago.
[00:08:54.356 --> 00:08:56.538]  I voted for Ron Paul five years ago or four years ago.
[00:08:56.578 --> 00:09:04.666]  But the point is I haven't been a heavy voter because I've just realized that it doesn't have a huge effect.
[00:09:04.686 --> 00:09:05.487]  So I'll go in with him first.
[00:09:05.507 --> 00:09:07.248]  You come in right behind me about 30 seconds or 20 seconds before.
[00:09:26.897 --> 00:09:32.880]  Sir, it is a federal law not to film in a polling place.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.320]  They do this all the time.
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.861]  Presidents vote.
[00:09:36.101 --> 00:09:37.442]  Media comes all the time and does this.
[00:09:37.462 --> 00:09:40.523]  Okay, we are told here that it's against the law.
[00:09:40.543 --> 00:09:41.544]  I'm not shooting the machines.
[00:09:42.104 --> 00:09:43.505]  It's a voting area.
[00:09:43.785 --> 00:09:45.305]  It's a polling place.
[00:09:45.906 --> 00:09:46.866]  So it's against the law.
[00:09:47.807 --> 00:09:48.847]  Please don't do that.
[00:09:49.227 --> 00:09:49.747]  Alright, I'll stop.
[00:09:52.452 --> 00:09:53.134]  Uh, it's fun.
[00:09:53.174 --> 00:09:53.796]  We're getting involved.
[00:09:53.816 --> 00:09:55.280]  Yeah, there's a lot of... Excuse me, sir.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:55.721]  Who are you?
[00:09:55.901 --> 00:09:56.323]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:09:56.343 --> 00:09:56.383]  Hi.
[00:09:56.804 --> 00:09:57.666]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:09:57.686 --> 00:09:58.107]  Nice to meet you.
[00:09:58.428 --> 00:09:58.789]  Who are you?
[00:09:59.645 --> 00:10:01.386]  I'm a syndicated radio host, TV host.
[00:10:01.966 --> 00:10:02.426]  Oh, okay.
[00:10:02.786 --> 00:10:04.427]  You're one of those political types of hosts?
[00:10:04.467 --> 00:10:04.627]  Yep.
[00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:05.508]  Oh, okay.
[00:10:05.968 --> 00:10:07.208]  It's like news, news stuff.
[00:10:07.248 --> 00:10:12.831]  And what we do is, you know, like... Are you like a Rush Limbaugh type?
[00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:14.312]  Well, it's more libertarian.
[00:10:14.932 --> 00:10:17.393]  But, like, what we do is... You're not an Alex Jones, are you?
[00:10:17.413 --> 00:10:18.173]  Yes, I am Alex Jones.
[00:10:18.794 --> 00:10:20.454]  He's the Alex Jones.
[00:10:20.574 --> 00:10:21.595]  I'm a Alex Jones.
[00:10:21.875 --> 00:10:24.836]  I'm one of 14 clowns that operate around the clock.
[00:10:24.856 --> 00:10:26.217]  Yeah, but you're not like him, are you?
[00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:27.331]  I'm not like him here.
[00:10:27.351 --> 00:10:27.852]  Come on over here.
[00:10:28.273 --> 00:10:29.476]  Oh, no, no, I'm working.
[00:10:29.997 --> 00:10:31.359]  I'm not like him on the radio.
[00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:32.421]  No, I'm just asking.
[00:10:32.441 --> 00:10:33.343]  What does he sound like on the radio?
[00:10:33.363 --> 00:10:34.625]  No, it's okay if you don't like him.
[00:10:34.645 --> 00:10:36.309]  He's a big radical psycho.
[00:10:36.349 --> 00:10:36.709]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:40.582 --> 00:10:41.963]  Well, I am a little radical.
[00:10:43.144 --> 00:10:47.948]  But, I mean, Barry Goldwater said, extremism and defensive liberty is no vice.
[00:10:48.708 --> 00:10:50.910]  We have a big global tyranny coming down on us.
[00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.471]  And so I do get a little bit aggressive because I want to wake people up.
[00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:57.714]  This is the Alex Jones Ridiculousness.
[00:10:57.774 --> 00:10:58.295]  It's alright.
[00:11:01.084 --> 00:11:01.444]  End to Oblivion!
[00:11:18.817 --> 00:11:22.858]  The story with Apple is something that we've been following for the past, I guess, couple weeks now.
[00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:32.021]  Basically, somebody tied to the San Bernardino shooter had an Apple phone, an iPhone, and they said, Apple, we want you to unlock this phone.
[00:11:32.262 --> 00:11:43.765]  Well, the Fed said this to Apple, and Apple said, no, we have encryption software and all this stuff, which I am kind of skeptical about, because if you guys recall, Edward Snowden in the PRISM documents, Apple is mentioned in that.
[00:11:43.805 --> 00:11:45.186]  So take all this with a grain of salt.
[00:11:45.646 --> 00:11:46.087]  I think so.
[00:12:04.426 --> 00:12:06.467]  I respect Apple for sticking to their guns on this one.
[00:12:06.827 --> 00:12:11.648]  And basically now Apple's lawyer is saying that if they lose, it could lead to a, quote, police state.
[00:12:11.988 --> 00:12:15.550]  And these were the words of Ted Olson as he spoke to CNN Money.
[00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:22.812]  And he says, even if a state judge could order Apple to build something, there's no stopping point, or there is no stopping point.
[00:12:23.152 --> 00:12:24.513]  That would lead to a police state.
[00:12:24.573 --> 00:12:25.833]  And these guys recognize that.
[00:12:25.973 --> 00:12:30.615]  They don't want a world where just anybody can hack into your phone because, you know, they have a badge.
[00:12:30.655 --> 00:12:34.796]  Now, once again, you could make the argument that in the case of terrorism, they should make an exception.
[00:12:35.316 --> 00:12:36.257]  Each zone on that one.
[00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.017]  But I do respect them for sticking to their guns.
[00:12:38.037 --> 00:12:45.100]  And also, Libertarian candidate John McAfee says that he will unlock the phone in a way that does not compromise Apple and would also make the FBI happy.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.561]  So there are other options out there available.
[00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:53.223]  And as we're talking about the police state, let's talk about the military state, as comes to the Oscars.
[00:12:53.623 --> 00:13:01.205]  Now, if you guys recall, you've seen the Demand a Plan videos, these Oscar winners, these actors, singers, all this stuff.
[00:13:01.505 --> 00:13:04.226]  They come out and they say, hey, we need a plan to end gun violence.
[00:13:04.246 --> 00:13:12.608]  And once again, I agree, I don't want somebody getting shot every weekend in Chicago, but I don't think disarming the citizenry is the way to go about it.
[00:13:13.049 --> 00:13:14.049]  But just to let you know,
[00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:18.852]  When you see these guys in the videos and all this stuff demand a plan, this is what they have to work with.
[00:13:19.613 --> 00:13:22.275]  Oscar security will be like a military state.
[00:13:22.755 --> 00:13:34.484]  And they're saying basically they don't have any credible threat, but they will have bomb-sniffing dogs, bulletproof vests, tactical gear, and most sophisticated surveillance equipment, keeping the people safe at the Oscars.
[00:13:34.804 --> 00:13:40.468]  And this also dovetails with the security they had at the Golden Globes, where, let's take a look at these photos here.
[00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:44.791]  They had heightened security at the Golden Globe because of terror attacks or whatever else.
[00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:48.773]  And there's one in particular, it's the guys on the red carpet with the dog.
[00:13:49.274 --> 00:13:54.036]  So, when you go to the Golden Globes, you go to the Oscars, this is the type of security that they have, right?
[00:13:54.096 --> 00:13:56.998]  It is somebody's job to keep them safe at the Oscars.
[00:13:57.058 --> 00:14:00.280]  And I'm not talking about, you know, Paul Blart mall cop.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.743]  I mean, they got full battle rattle guys ready to go if, lo and behold, ISIS shows up.
[00:14:06.443 --> 00:14:10.947]  Meanwhile, if you work at Piggly Wiggly and somebody comes in there with a shotgun, who's going to protect you?
[00:14:11.388 --> 00:14:11.808]  Nobody.
[00:14:12.188 --> 00:14:20.075]  That's why I'm an advocate of the Second Amendment, so you at least have the option and the ability to defend yourself if somebody comes in there looking for trouble.
[00:14:20.456 --> 00:14:23.579]  Same thing with these congressmen, all the way down to the city councilors.
[00:14:23.859 --> 00:14:25.320]  They say, let's ban guns, let's ban this.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:32.627]  They have somebody stationed, if not multiple people stationed in those facilities, whose job it is to protect them if something does go south.
[00:14:33.067 --> 00:14:36.448]  And our last story before we go on to a special report from John Bowne.
[00:14:36.628 --> 00:14:43.389]  The Missouri professor who pushed a reporter away and was threatening the reporter has been fired from the University of Missouri.
[00:14:43.429 --> 00:14:45.470]  Me and Kit went to go interview her.
[00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.790]  Not surprisingly, she was unavailable for comment.
[00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:55.292]  Now let's go to the special report from John Bowne as he documents Vicente Fox in his statement that he is not going to pay for that quote, effing wall.
[00:14:56.687 --> 00:14:58.527]  The new world order crime syndicate.
[00:14:58.888 --> 00:14:59.628]  Oh, pardon me.
[00:14:59.928 --> 00:15:03.769]  World leaders are pulling out the stops to lecture the American people.
[00:15:03.989 --> 00:15:09.550]  The Pope is demanding Americans allow an invasion of disease, crime, and terror into our country.
[00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:16.332]  Meanwhile, Sweden and Norway are on the verge of collapse due to the full-scale migrant invasion of Europe.
[00:15:17.192 --> 00:15:22.333]  Hey boy, una persona que pensa
[00:15:23.434 --> 00:15:32.472]  Only in building walls, wherever they are, and not building bridges, you're not a Christian.
[00:15:34.124 --> 00:15:34.364]  I'm good.
[00:15:54.304 --> 00:16:04.508]  Came after GOP favorite Donald Trump won Nevada's caucus with a landslide 45.9% of the vote and 14 of its 30 delegates.
[00:16:04.828 --> 00:16:14.071]  In a statement made overnight, China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters in Beijing that we are following with interest the U.S.
[00:16:14.211 --> 00:16:15.631]  presidential election.
[00:16:15.851 --> 00:16:20.073]  And now former Mexican President Vicente Fox is lecturing America.
[00:16:20.273 --> 00:16:22.673]  He knows Mexico needs the U.S.
[00:16:22.733 --> 00:16:24.834]  when it comes to trade, just the way the U.S.
[00:16:24.874 --> 00:16:25.674]  needs Mexico.
[00:16:25.994 --> 00:16:30.635]  I have to say, we're not, I am not going to pay for that wall.
[00:16:30.875 --> 00:16:31.615]  I am not.
[00:16:32.055 --> 00:16:42.777]  So if you don't get an actual check from the Mexican government for 8 or 10 or 12 billion dollars, whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?
[00:16:43.557 --> 00:16:46.658]  I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller.
[00:16:46.838 --> 00:16:47.238]  Believe me.
[00:16:48.138 --> 00:16:53.463]  This is the same New World Order criminal that pushed to merge the United States with Mexico.
[00:16:53.623 --> 00:16:56.186]  Kit Daniels writes, Fox wanted the U.S.
[00:16:56.206 --> 00:17:09.138]  to join Mexico and Canada into an EU-style North American Union, which would combine all three countries into one regional government using one currency, like the Euro, at the expense of both U.S.
[00:17:09.218 --> 00:17:12.041]  national sovereignty and individual rights.
[00:17:12.561 --> 00:17:25.736]  Vicente wrote in his autobiography, Revolution of Hope, I proposed a NAFTA plus plan to President Bush and Canada's Prime Minister to move us toward a single continental economic union modeled on the European example.
[00:17:26.197 --> 00:17:31.383]  At summits I took every opportunity to advocate clearly for free market policies.
[00:17:31.923 --> 00:17:40.433]  Showing what sound economics could do to fund social justice, arguing for globalism and the free trade area of the Americas.
[00:17:40.813 --> 00:17:48.102]  In concert with Vicente Fox, the CFR proposed increased labor mobility between the US and Mexico
[00:17:48.442 --> 00:18:02.009]  Which would effectively grant amnesty to illegal immigrants and a North American regulatory plan with a unified approach to all three countries, which would effectively end U.S.
[00:18:02.109 --> 00:18:03.210]  national sovereignty.
[00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:13.455]  Meanwhile, our government continues to persecute from within, as the Republican presidential candidates express their dismay with being audited by the IRS.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.284]  We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong.
[00:18:18.304 --> 00:18:23.549]  You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast.
[00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:26.131]  I'm always audited by the IRS.
[00:18:26.432 --> 00:18:39.364]  And as the New World Order mouthpieces, uh, excuse me, and as the world leaders lash out against a populist blowback to their domination of planet Earth, how long before they push yet another button
[00:18:39.764 --> 00:18:42.408]  To get their agenda moving in the right direction.
[00:18:42.748 --> 00:18:44.791]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:19:01.172 --> 00:19:05.335]  And I wanna say, PUT ON THESE GLASSES OR START CHEWING CONCRETE!
[00:19:06.536 --> 00:19:10.419]  I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.042]  And I'm all out of bubblegum!
[00:19:15.303 --> 00:19:17.344]  Time to take a stand, boys!
[00:19:17.945 --> 00:19:23.469]  I'm Alex Jones, and like Rowdy Piper, I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick globalist butt.
[00:19:24.744 --> 00:19:32.211]  It's time for all of you, the Infowarriors, and myself included, to take our fight to the next level and to help the public put the sunglasses on.
[00:19:32.531 --> 00:19:41.219]  The metaphor for expanding your awareness, researching what's happening, and admitting there's a global elite establishing a planetary tyranny.
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.381]  And I was just thinking about it today.
[00:19:44.362 --> 00:19:45.843]  It's leap year coming up on Monday.
[00:19:46.464 --> 00:19:49.666]  That only happens every four years at the end of February.
[00:19:50.444 --> 00:19:54.607]  And this is the best time ever to promote liberty and freedom everywhere.
[00:19:55.187 --> 00:20:07.596]  We got Super Tuesday coming up next week and it's important for Americans to be involved in their political process, but not just in their political process, in every action you take with what you talk about and
[00:20:09.076 --> 00:20:13.658]  The products you buy and what you promote, you affect change in the world.
[00:20:14.018 --> 00:20:20.121]  We don't just vote at the ballot box, we vote with our dollars, we vote with our feet, we vote with our actions.
[00:20:20.881 --> 00:20:32.547]  And that's why for Leap Year, running from this Friday evening right through Monday evening, we're running the biggest sale in the history of 20 plus years of InfoWars and InfoWars.com.
[00:20:33.027 --> 00:20:36.348]  The Leap Year Special only comes around every four years.
[00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:45.771]  30% off all products at InfoWarsStore.com and free shipping on top of the discounts that are already there.
[00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:56.235]  This is a major loss leader with some of the products, but overall it will help us fund the InfoWars operation and get our reporters out there across the world covering what's happening.
[00:20:56.615 --> 00:20:58.115]  The planet is ready to wake up.
[00:20:58.535 --> 00:20:59.636]  People are ready for the truth.
[00:21:00.256 --> 00:21:13.161]  But to do that, those of you already awake have to redouble your efforts spreading the word and directing people to good sources of pro-human information like InfoWars.com, my syndicated radio show, The Nightly News, and more.
[00:21:13.861 --> 00:21:17.763]  I'll be back this Sunday live, 4-6pm, with a Sunday radio show as well.
[00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:25.466]  But in the meantime, take the time out to visit InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com to find the specific nutraceuticals
[00:21:25.726 --> 00:21:25.986]  Thank you.
[00:21:43.817 --> 00:21:46.699]  Good halogen ever, and what it does is simply amazing.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:52.885]  Read the 5-star reviews at InfoWarsLife.com today, and take advantage of the biggest sale ever in InfoWars history.
[00:21:53.205 --> 00:22:01.672]  And on top of that, I finally want to thank all of you that have spread the word about the broadcast, and that have supported us and our sponsors, and bought the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:22:01.832 --> 00:22:04.014]  Because without you, none of this would have been possible.
[00:22:04.594 --> 00:22:23.168]  My pledge to you is that I will keep the sunglasses on and this operation will be a sunglass factory in the metaphor or the allegory of they live and that we will help humanity take the blinders off, come out of the cave and defeat this globalist system that's being constructed.
[00:22:23.628 --> 00:22:25.730]  Now back to InfoWars Nightly News and more.
[00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:26.711]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:30.472 --> 00:22:31.993]  Take a stand, boys.
[00:22:32.454 --> 00:22:33.154]  You know what?
[00:22:33.174 --> 00:22:34.756]  You've got a little courage.
[00:22:34.836 --> 00:22:36.197]  Stand up for yourself.
[00:22:38.139 --> 00:22:40.561]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:22:40.721 --> 00:22:46.066]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:22:47.267 --> 00:22:51.271]  The Oscar winners give a press conference and how to buy a sailboat.
[00:22:51.411 --> 00:22:53.853]  Long live the Republic!
[00:23:11.294 --> 00:23:13.295]  Leanne McAdoo for InfoWars.com.
[00:23:13.335 --> 00:23:20.300]  Now Apple's Tim Cook says that this iPhone could be the potential gateway to the police state if the FBI has their way.
[00:23:20.601 --> 00:23:29.787]  So we're out here today to find out from people if they think Apple's decision to push back against the FBI's request is aiding and abetting terrorism or the American people.
[00:23:30.627 --> 00:23:34.650]  What do you think about the Apple versus FBI situation going on right now?
[00:23:36.277 --> 00:23:42.744]  Well, I think they should definitely continue to prevent the FBI from hacking their own customers.
[00:23:43.464 --> 00:23:45.486]  Wow!
[00:23:46.267 --> 00:23:50.211]  I mean, would you buy a phone that you know that the company can tap into whenever they wanted to?
[00:23:50.231 --> 00:23:50.692]  Right.
[00:23:51.412 --> 00:23:57.659]  And that's a lot of the reason why people purchase the iPhone, because of the fact that Apple promised them.
[00:23:57.679 --> 00:23:58.199]  You do the same thing.
[00:23:58.239 --> 00:23:59.621]  It's a lot harder to hack into one of them.
[00:24:00.103 --> 00:24:07.987]  You think they should open up the cell phone and create the software so the FBI can potentially get into people's phones to fight terrorism?
[00:24:09.788 --> 00:24:10.789]  Oh, that's a hard one.
[00:24:10.809 --> 00:24:15.712]  I just think we should really protect our privacy, but yet I do want them to be able to
[00:24:17.284 --> 00:24:20.145]  Hey guys, can I get the passcode to your iPhones?
[00:24:20.165 --> 00:24:20.225]  Why?
[00:24:20.245 --> 00:24:21.905]  Do you guys have something to hide?
[00:24:22.005 --> 00:24:22.085]  Yep.
[00:24:22.105 --> 00:24:22.445]  Terrorists?
[00:24:48.215 --> 00:24:48.895]  No!
[00:24:49.235 --> 00:24:50.956]  I'm on Apple's side!
[00:24:52.796 --> 00:25:07.740]  In a sense they're right because the technology if it does get leaked then Apple's like gonna be screwed over you know that's gonna ruin their reputation but also Apple needs to help the government out for to find things out about this shooter so it's I don't know it's a hard decision.
[00:25:08.413 --> 00:25:14.136]  We do have to prevent terror attacks, and electronic information is quite valuable for terrorists.
[00:25:14.196 --> 00:25:17.578]  So, I can see both sides of the case, but I have to go with Apple on this one.
[00:25:17.858 --> 00:25:20.140]  I think privacy is a very important thing.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:26.803]  You know, as technology advances and stuff, it's really important that we maintain our privacy from the government and the tech companies.
[00:25:28.324 --> 00:25:29.625]  So, it's... What is it?
[00:25:29.865 --> 00:25:30.525]  It's unlocked.
[00:25:31.706 --> 00:25:32.746]  So you're not even worried.
[00:25:33.907 --> 00:25:34.407]  Yeah, I'm not really.
[00:25:34.427 --> 00:25:37.009]  I have nothing to hide, so... If you wanna...
[00:25:38.584 --> 00:25:40.045]  Get in there and see what you got going on.
[00:25:40.445 --> 00:25:40.645]  Sure.
[00:25:41.846 --> 00:25:42.787]  Actually, no, let's not do that.
[00:25:43.307 --> 00:25:44.688]  So you got the iPhone.
[00:25:44.788 --> 00:25:45.148]  I do.
[00:25:45.528 --> 00:25:47.850]  What do you think about Apple versus the FBI?
[00:25:49.148 --> 00:25:52.269]  Uh, I think that they should definitely comply with the FBI.
[00:25:52.349 --> 00:25:55.289]  Do you think that this is going to set a precedent like Apple believes?
[00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:56.989]  I mean, think about it.
[00:25:57.009 --> 00:25:58.150]  The Internet of Things is coming.
[00:25:58.690 --> 00:25:59.390]  And we know that.
[00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:04.191]  So is there going to be a backdoor in everything that we are going to be using in the future?
[00:26:04.211 --> 00:26:05.711]  No, that's a good question.
[00:26:05.751 --> 00:26:09.312]  I think this is definitely a different situation.
[00:26:09.832 --> 00:26:16.293]  And unfortunately, in a different situation, you have to have those rules that may not comply with everybody else.
[00:26:17.526 --> 00:26:18.887]  I think this is a one-off thing.
[00:26:18.907 --> 00:26:23.189]  I don't think they're going to try to apply it to across the board.
[00:26:23.209 --> 00:26:27.671]  I think they just want to do it this one time, help them out, help the FBI.
[00:26:27.871 --> 00:26:28.892]  We want to catch these people.
[00:26:29.454 --> 00:26:38.379]  And so what do you think about this kind of pushback where you can see the FBI came out to the press before even trying to go talk to Apple and sort of tarnishing their reputation.
[00:26:38.739 --> 00:26:41.281]  Did you think that that was the appropriate thing to do or?
[00:26:41.661 --> 00:26:42.181]  Absolutely not.
[00:26:42.201 --> 00:26:43.782]  I think it's kind of a sensitive topic to begin with.
[00:26:44.002 --> 00:26:49.486]  So I think that you need to confront the company first, behind closed doors, make sure nobody knows about it.
[00:26:49.986 --> 00:26:53.608]  And then if it ends up happening, then you take, then you release it to the media.
[00:26:53.628 --> 00:26:54.268]  If that makes any sense.
[00:26:54.609 --> 00:26:58.291]  I'm more opposed to the government dictating what a company has to do.
[00:26:59.091 --> 00:26:59.272]  Yeah.
[00:27:17.108 --> 00:27:19.069]  Hey there, Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[00:27:19.289 --> 00:27:24.833]  We're at the University of Texas in Austin, home of some of the most brilliantly minded people known to man.
[00:27:25.393 --> 00:27:26.274]  What's the Second Amendment again?
[00:27:26.634 --> 00:27:27.354]  The right to bear arms?
[00:27:27.574 --> 00:27:28.135]  Okay, yeah.
[00:27:28.195 --> 00:27:29.175]  Is that the gun control one?
[00:27:29.195 --> 00:27:30.376]  I don't know.
[00:27:30.896 --> 00:27:32.277]  I'm from Mexico, so I don't know.
[00:27:32.778 --> 00:27:37.440]  I'm not familiar with the historical connotations of Black Friday.
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.241]  Um, I guess so.
[00:27:40.342 --> 00:27:41.883]  Do you know what the Declaration of Independence is?
[00:27:43.224 --> 00:27:43.984]  Who was the president?
[00:27:44.945 --> 00:27:46.406]  That I knew, and I, wait.
[00:27:47.702 --> 00:27:49.864]  No, I don't know.
[00:27:50.504 --> 00:27:51.926]  Sorry, I'm not sure.
[00:27:51.946 --> 00:27:53.127]  You don't know who Donald Trump is?
[00:27:53.347 --> 00:27:53.487]  No.
[00:27:53.867 --> 00:27:54.328]  What?!
[00:27:54.468 --> 00:27:55.028]  What about you, man?
[00:27:55.068 --> 00:27:56.189]  I don't know.
[00:27:56.309 --> 00:27:57.530]  Are you going to school here?
[00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:58.151]  Yeah.
[00:27:58.411 --> 00:27:59.672]  You don't know who Donald Trump is?
[00:28:00.012 --> 00:28:00.593]  No.
[00:28:00.673 --> 00:28:01.414]  Is he a teacher?
[00:28:02.964 --> 00:28:03.724]  Well, there you have it.
[00:28:03.764 --> 00:28:05.606]  Some interesting people to say the least.
[00:28:05.986 --> 00:28:14.251]  Now we're going to give you, the college student that represents America, an opportunity to look into the camera and tell the presidential frontrunners exactly how you feel.
[00:28:14.571 --> 00:28:15.231]  Hey, what's going on man?
[00:28:15.431 --> 00:28:16.172]  Puppies or kittens?
[00:28:16.812 --> 00:28:17.152]  Puppies.
[00:28:17.592 --> 00:28:18.293]  Puppies, for sure.
[00:28:18.933 --> 00:28:19.594]  Puppies, for sure.
[00:28:19.894 --> 00:28:20.734]  Why puppies?
[00:28:21.135 --> 00:28:22.055]  Because I'm a dog guy.
[00:28:22.375 --> 00:28:25.077]  I tricked you with that puppies and kitten thing to get you in here, alright?
[00:28:25.557 --> 00:28:25.737]  Yeah.
[00:28:25.897 --> 00:28:27.678]  If you could tell Donald Trump anything right now, what would it be?
[00:28:28.819 --> 00:28:30.360]  I would say, shut up.
[00:28:31.104 --> 00:28:31.424]  That's it?
[00:28:31.685 --> 00:28:31.905]  Yeah.
[00:28:32.345 --> 00:28:33.426]  I think he's a racist.
[00:28:33.546 --> 00:28:35.027]  I think he's a self-centered pig.
[00:28:35.408 --> 00:28:36.008]  Go away!
[00:28:36.529 --> 00:28:37.409]  He's stupid.
[00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:39.071]  He's, uh, racist.
[00:28:39.631 --> 00:28:40.372]  Stop being racist.
[00:28:40.392 --> 00:28:41.773]  I love you, Donald Trump.
[00:28:41.813 --> 00:28:44.195]  You're the most real guy in politics right now.
[00:28:44.235 --> 00:28:45.676]  I feel like you're the only one I can trust.
[00:28:46.257 --> 00:28:46.777]  You got my vote.
[00:28:47.198 --> 00:28:52.362]  I've followed him, and I've listened to him, and every time you see a still shot of him, it looks like you need to suck the c**k in his mouth.
[00:28:52.902 --> 00:28:53.503]  F**k you.
[00:28:53.523 --> 00:28:56.425]  Uh, get the f**k out of the political campaign?
[00:28:56.946 --> 00:28:58.087]  What the f**k is wrong with you, man?
[00:28:59.602 --> 00:28:59.902]  That's it?
[00:29:00.102 --> 00:29:01.223]  Yeah, that's all I got.
[00:29:01.243 --> 00:29:02.663]  You should be nicer to people.
[00:29:02.683 --> 00:29:04.744]  He can go f*** himself pretty much.
[00:29:05.085 --> 00:29:06.965]  I'm waiting for him to get assassinated, really.
[00:29:07.266 --> 00:29:10.107]  I hope somebody pulls the trigger on him, because we need something better than that.
[00:29:10.127 --> 00:29:11.327]  Just gotta make sure I don't get shot.
[00:29:12.188 --> 00:29:13.128]  Donald Trump, you're the man.
[00:29:13.168 --> 00:29:13.589]  Let's go.
[00:29:13.849 --> 00:29:14.209]  President.
[00:29:14.529 --> 00:29:15.730]  I think he'd be a wonderful president.
[00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.610]  Trump.
[00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:17.670]  He's the man.
[00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:18.611]  Do you like Donald Trump?
[00:29:19.673 --> 00:29:19.913]  Yes.
[00:29:20.534 --> 00:29:22.035]  I'd say he seems pretty racist.
[00:29:22.415 --> 00:29:23.096]  Why is he being racist?
[00:29:23.516 --> 00:29:27.019]  Because he classifies all Muslims as bad people when they're not.
[00:29:27.319 --> 00:29:28.000]  Why is he a racist?
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.144]  Because he straight up said he doesn't want Mexicans or Hispanics to know any country.
[00:29:33.564 --> 00:29:34.245]  What, because of a wall?
[00:29:34.885 --> 00:29:35.085]  Yeah.
[00:29:35.366 --> 00:29:36.967]  You know there's a wall in the south part of Mexico, right?
[00:29:38.274 --> 00:29:38.774]  No, I didn't know that.
[00:29:39.095 --> 00:29:42.237]  I've lived with Mexicans, and they're the best people I've ever met on my planet.
[00:29:42.277 --> 00:29:44.078]  You know there's a border on the south part of Mexico, right?
[00:29:44.218 --> 00:29:44.739]  Yes, I do.
[00:29:45.019 --> 00:29:45.539]  Yes, I do.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:46.440]  So they can have one.
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:47.121]  They should.
[00:29:47.141 --> 00:29:47.641]  They should.
[00:29:47.661 --> 00:29:48.382]  Why can't we have one?
[00:29:48.542 --> 00:29:48.762]  Right?
[00:29:48.822 --> 00:29:49.683]  Well, we can have a border.
[00:29:49.723 --> 00:29:50.943]  I mean, you know, we could have it that way.
[00:29:50.963 --> 00:29:52.244]  Did you know there's a wall around the Vatican?
[00:29:52.945 --> 00:29:53.405]  I didn't know that.
[00:29:54.606 --> 00:29:57.008]  Um, I don't think it's explicitly to keep out of the Hispanics though.
[00:29:57.628 --> 00:29:59.850]  Also, I wouldn't say I'm super informed on the presidential stuff.
[00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:00.911]  F*** off.
[00:30:01.491 --> 00:30:01.872]  Thank you.
[00:30:02.132 --> 00:30:02.852]  What about Hillary Clinton?
[00:30:03.513 --> 00:30:04.173]  Uh, you're great.
[00:30:04.413 --> 00:30:04.794]  What do you think?
[00:30:07.644 --> 00:30:08.385]  I support Hillary.
[00:30:08.465 --> 00:30:09.005]  I like Hillary.
[00:30:09.045 --> 00:30:12.368]  I like Bernie more, but I would vote for Hillary over Trump any day.
[00:30:12.388 --> 00:30:13.329]  I like Hillary.
[00:30:13.349 --> 00:30:14.249]  I like her ideas.
[00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:18.333]  For Hillary, I just want her to be a little bit more upfront and to be... So honest?
[00:30:18.713 --> 00:30:19.053]  Yeah.
[00:30:19.153 --> 00:30:20.054]  Do you think she's a feminist?
[00:30:20.755 --> 00:30:21.855]  Yeah, I think she's a feminist.
[00:30:22.056 --> 00:30:23.156]  She's doing something for women.
[00:30:23.637 --> 00:30:26.599]  I can't deny that, so... Also, she takes money from Saudi Arabia.
[00:30:26.619 --> 00:30:27.760]  They make women cover themselves.
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.061]  They behead them in the streets.
[00:30:29.702 --> 00:30:33.345]  She covered for Bill Clinton's love affairs and threatened them with money.
[00:30:34.062 --> 00:30:34.322]  Yes.
[00:30:34.382 --> 00:30:34.983]  Is that a feminist?
[00:30:35.243 --> 00:30:36.865]  No, that part is not a feminist.
[00:30:36.885 --> 00:30:43.791]  I think to see a woman as a front candidate for the presidency of the United States is always a big deal, so definitely a positive thing.
[00:30:44.752 --> 00:30:49.075]  F*** Hillary Clinton.
[00:30:51.117 --> 00:30:55.962]  As a community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.
[00:30:58.877 --> 00:31:07.564]  That's veteran Denver Police Officer Charles Jones IV smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times.
[00:31:08.105 --> 00:31:12.408]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect and then trying to erase the evidence.
[00:31:12.428 --> 00:31:14.870]  I'm observing what they're doing and they don't see me!
[00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:16.992]  I don't understand what's going on!
[00:31:17.012 --> 00:31:26.780]  A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio, and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:35.124]  Doesn't it raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government?
[00:31:35.384 --> 00:31:36.925]  How can you ask such a question?
[00:31:36.945 --> 00:31:40.587]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:31:40.627 --> 00:31:46.950]  When a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in the community, he looks beyond fine words and noble phrases.
[00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:54.594]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
[00:31:55.757 --> 00:31:57.740]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.141]  What I say, go.
[00:31:59.321 --> 00:31:59.482]  See?
[00:31:59.542 --> 00:32:01.905]  I'm the law around here.
[00:32:01.925 --> 00:32:06.971]  He came, he saw, he died.
[00:32:09.611 --> 00:32:15.812]  Yes, in modern warfare, our military leaders are finding that words and ideas are highly effective weapons.
[00:32:16.253 --> 00:32:18.093]  We just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:32:18.133 --> 00:32:25.095]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:32:25.535 --> 00:32:27.655]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[00:32:27.795 --> 00:32:29.436]  You really don't have to trust me.
[00:32:29.456 --> 00:32:30.236]  You shouldn't trust me.
[00:32:30.276 --> 00:32:33.777]  In fact, by my actually participating that, I will taint the news.
[00:32:34.357 --> 00:32:38.438]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[00:32:39.518 --> 00:32:45.482]  Nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[00:32:45.502 --> 00:32:50.706]  Oh goodness you, well we're gonna do everything we can to help you.
[00:32:50.726 --> 00:32:54.168]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:32:54.768 --> 00:32:57.330]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:00.292]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[00:33:02.025 --> 00:33:06.188]  And I want to say, put on these glasses or start chewing concrete!
[00:33:07.369 --> 00:33:11.272]  I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
[00:33:12.793 --> 00:33:14.875]  And I'm all out of bubblegum.
[00:33:16.156 --> 00:33:18.197]  Time to take a stand, boys.
[00:33:18.778 --> 00:33:24.302]  I'm Alex Jones, and like Rowdy Piper, I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick gloveless butt.
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:33.046]  It's time for all of you, the Infowarriors, and myself included, to take our fight to the next level and to help the public put the sunglasses on.
[00:33:33.386 --> 00:33:42.054]  The metaphor for expanding your awareness, researching what's happening, and admitting there's a global elite establishing a planetary tyranny.
[00:33:42.974 --> 00:33:44.215]  And I was just thinking about it today.
[00:33:45.196 --> 00:33:46.677]  It's leap year coming up on Monday.
[00:33:47.298 --> 00:33:50.501]  That only happens every four years at the end of February.
[00:33:51.277 --> 00:33:51.337]  And
[00:34:09.932 --> 00:34:14.494]  The products you buy and what you promote, you affect change in the world.
[00:34:14.874 --> 00:34:20.957]  We don't just vote at the ballot box, we vote with our dollars, we vote with our feet, we vote with our actions.
[00:34:21.737 --> 00:34:33.383]  And that's why for Leap Year, running from this Friday evening right through Monday evening, we're running the biggest sale in the history of 20 plus years of InfoWars and InfoWars.com.
[00:34:33.863 --> 00:34:37.207]  The Leap Year Special only comes around every four years.
[00:34:37.227 --> 00:34:41.752]  30% off all products at InfoWarsTore.com and
[00:34:42.782 --> 00:34:46.625]  Free shipping on top of the discounts that are already there.
[00:34:46.865 --> 00:34:57.093]  This is a major loss leader with some of the products, but overall it will help us fund the InfoMores operation and get our reporters out there across the world covering what's happening.
[00:34:57.473 --> 00:34:58.954]  The planet is ready to wake up.
[00:34:59.394 --> 00:35:00.495]  People are ready for the truth.
[00:35:01.116 --> 00:35:05.259]  But to do that, those of you already awake have to redouble your efforts spreading the word.
[00:35:05.979 --> 00:35:06.539]  We're good to go.
[00:35:26.565 --> 00:35:27.025]  We're good to go!
[00:35:44.654 --> 00:35:47.516]  Good halogen ever, and what it does is simply amazing.
[00:35:47.596 --> 00:35:53.720]  Read the five-star reviews at InfoWarsLife.com today, and take advantage of the biggest sale ever in InfoWars history.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:36:02.505]  And on top of that, I finally want to thank all of you that have spread the word about the broadcast, and that have supported us and our sponsors, and bought the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:36:02.665 --> 00:36:04.847]  Because without you, none of this would have been possible.
[00:36:05.427 --> 00:36:24.006]  My pledge to you is that I will keep the sunglasses on and this operation will be a sunglass factory in the metaphor or the allegory of they live and that we will help humanity take the blinders off, come out of the cave and defeat this globalist system that's being constructed.
[00:36:24.487 --> 00:36:26.569]  Now back to InfoWars Nightly News and more.
[00:36:26.949 --> 00:36:27.570]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:36:31.308 --> 00:36:32.829]  Take a stand, boys.
[00:36:33.329 --> 00:36:34.030]  You know what?
[00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:35.571]  You got a little courage.
[00:36:35.671 --> 00:36:37.052]  Stand up for yourself.
[00:36:38.953 --> 00:36:41.395]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:36:41.575 --> 00:36:46.899]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:52.102]  The Oscar winners give a press conference and how to buy a sailboat.
[00:37:25.225 --> 00:37:28.548]  You are in a war for your mind, whether you believe it or not.
[00:37:28.788 --> 00:37:34.633]  More than anything, the ruling elite have been bombarding the controlled narrative that long before you were even born.
[00:37:34.894 --> 00:37:40.739]  They have been using a two-faced mind control technique known as the Hegelian Dialectic to control both sides of an issue.
[00:37:40.939 --> 00:37:43.121]  To keep you locked in a cage of powerlessness.
[00:37:43.481 --> 00:37:52.130]  That is how the only vote standing in the pathway of Obama's lame-duck New World Order policies was snuffed out without most people asking any questions.
[00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:57.835]  That is why the details are so important to a more corrupt county than Presidio County, Texas.
[00:37:58.115 --> 00:38:06.143]  He was participating in a long President's Day weekend blue quail hunting vacation courtesy of the ranch owner, Houston billionaire John B. Poindexter.
[00:38:06.383 --> 00:38:10.746]  Scalia was accompanied by a friend from Washington whose identity remains unknown.
[00:38:10.906 --> 00:38:15.829]  The identities of the other guests staying at the ranch with Scalia has also remained a closely guarded secret.
[00:38:16.049 --> 00:38:20.952]  Scalia's body was viewed by Poindexter, Presidio County Sheriff Danny Dominguez, and U.S.
[00:38:21.013 --> 00:38:22.213]  Marshal Ken Roberts.
[00:38:22.574 --> 00:38:25.816]  Dominguez is primary challenger in the upcoming primary election.
[00:38:26.156 --> 00:38:33.961]  Former Deputy Sheriff Cesar Melendez says Dominguez violated all standard Presidio County procedures in the death of Scalia.
[00:38:34.301 --> 00:38:39.986]  Scalia's room was not quarantined as a potential crime scene, nor was an in-person inquest conducted.
[00:38:40.146 --> 00:38:51.076]  Melendez said that sudden or unattended deaths like that of Scalia are always treated as homicides until deemed otherwise from collected evidence, including, at a minimum, an eyes-on inquest.
[00:38:51.437 --> 00:39:00.705]  Scalia's family requested that no autopsy be performed, but Texas law requires a legitimate medical inquest, which was not conducted in Scalia's case.
[00:39:00.905 --> 00:39:08.571]  Presidio County Judge Cinderella Guevara was contacted after two justices of the peace were contacted to conduct an inquest into Scalia's death.
[00:39:08.872 --> 00:39:14.616]  David Beebe, JP for County Precinct 1, said he was busy at a campaign forum in a neighboring Brewster County.
[00:39:14.997 --> 00:39:20.962]  Juanita Bishop, JP for County Precinct 2, said she was at a job-related event in Fort Stockton, 120 miles away from the ranch.
[00:39:22.683 --> 00:39:25.665]  BB said there was only one funeral home in the area.
[00:39:26.105 --> 00:39:28.066]  Alpine Funeral Home in Alpine, Texas.
[00:39:28.186 --> 00:39:29.647]  A one hour drive from the ranch.
[00:39:29.687 --> 00:39:32.448]  However, Melendez said there is one in Marfa.
[00:39:32.809 --> 00:39:34.510]  A half hour drive from the ranch.
[00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:36.311]  Which can also embalm bodies.
[00:39:36.671 --> 00:39:42.294]  Scalia's body was inexplicably transported to El Paso in an Alpine Funeral Home hearse.
[00:39:42.734 --> 00:39:46.756]  El Paso is a three and a half hour drive from the Cibolo Creek Resort.
[00:39:47.176 --> 00:39:55.021]  Scalia was embalmed at El Paso's Sunset Funeral Home and flown out of El Paso International Airport on a private plane to Washington, D.C.
[00:39:55.421 --> 00:40:00.403]  Planes to fly Scalia's body to either Dallas or San Antonio were readily available.
[00:40:00.784 --> 00:40:08.708]  The funeral director who embalmed Scalia said it is standard procedure to flush bodily fluids, including blood and urine, into the municipal sewage system.
[00:40:09.208 --> 00:40:23.705]  Sheriff Candidate Melendez said that is not the normal procedure in Presidio County where Scalia died because with a high water table there's always the potential for contamination from sewage system leaching potentially dangerous fluids into the fresh water supply.
[00:40:24.165 --> 00:40:24.706]  We're good to go.
[00:40:39.679 --> 00:40:54.416]  The Washington Post reports Poindexter, the owner of Cibolo Creek Ranch, was a high-ranking member of a worldwide male-only society that wears dark green robes emblazoned with a large cross and the motto, honoring God by honoring his creatures, according to the group's website.
[00:40:54.696 --> 00:40:59.240]  The Ancient Order's name is in honor of Hubert, the patron saint of hunters and fishermen.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.981]  The Society's U.S.
[00:41:01.041 --> 00:41:12.450]  chapter launched in 1966 at the famous Bohemian Club in San Francisco, which is associated with the all-male Bohemian Grove, one of the most well-known secret societies in the country.
[00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:21.317]  The Bohemian Grove that I attend, one time or another, the Eagles and the others have come there, but it is the most faggot goddamn thing you will ever hear.
[00:41:22.182 --> 00:41:24.525]  The Ancient International Order of St.
[00:41:24.605 --> 00:41:28.871]  Hubertus is represented by the label on a Jägermeister bottle, no less.
[00:41:29.391 --> 00:41:33.036]  Was Poindexter just a member of a small, elite hunting club?
[00:41:33.717 --> 00:41:34.618]  Don't kid yourself.
[00:41:35.079 --> 00:41:38.744]  Nowadays, we the people rarely decide on the promotion of the common good.
[00:41:39.284 --> 00:41:54.032]  Ultimately, every key decision regarding future generations is managed at confabs like Davos and Bilderberg by a small group of billionaires that ferret out their demands to their compromised talking heads to ram their New World Order agenda into your cranium.
[00:41:54.332 --> 00:41:55.694]  I told you about the order of death.
[00:42:17.495 --> 00:42:17.935]  I don't know.
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.941]  left-hand man in charge of it.
[00:42:36.041 --> 00:42:40.142]  They killed the leader of the order because they wouldn't let them take it over.
[00:42:40.162 --> 00:42:51.765]  And that's in order of the death said that they were taking out the different Illuminati spinoff groups, the Masonic groups, all of them that didn't fully turn over their entire secret organization to the Nazis.
[00:42:52.585 --> 00:42:53.826]  So people like to make these jokes.
[00:42:54.006 --> 00:42:56.267]  Oh, Jones says German death cults run it all.
[00:42:56.327 --> 00:42:58.987]  Germans, you know, Illuminati.
[00:42:59.187 --> 00:43:00.688]  Well, no, it started there.
[00:43:01.448 --> 00:43:04.711]  But it's a worldwide system of control and that's what it is.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.742]  Let me make this one point extremely clear.
[00:43:27.842 --> 00:43:28.643]  What's the major motive?
[00:43:29.283 --> 00:43:32.245]  He had a pillow on his head!
[00:43:32.425 --> 00:43:38.170]  Meanwhile, according to former Clinton insider Larry Nichols, the Scalia death will be investigated.
[00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:40.171]  Here's what's coming.
[00:43:41.612 --> 00:43:42.933]  There's going to be an investigation.
[00:43:43.954 --> 00:43:50.939]  So many of the things that were given as evidence and witnesses statements have turned out to be wrong.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.081]  Wrongness, lies, whatever.
[00:43:54.721 --> 00:44:02.646]  There's fixing to be a serious investigation, and we're going to find out the truth about Scalia.
[00:44:02.946 --> 00:44:07.389]  Now, we may not find out about it through the mainstream media, but I assure you, I will know.
[00:44:07.529 --> 00:44:10.711]  And if I know, you'll know and your audience will know.
[00:44:11.652 --> 00:44:12.592]  So that's coming.
[00:44:12.652 --> 00:44:15.014]  Now, what kind of got me in the middle of it?
[00:44:16.152 --> 00:44:19.414]  Is the guy that owns the ranch, his name is Poindexter.
[00:44:19.915 --> 00:44:28.160]  When I was with the Contras in Nicaragua, when we would fight in the southern part of Nicaragua, there you would team up with the Muscogee Indians.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:39.127]  When we'd start being chased by the Sandinistas, we'd run across the border into Costa Rica into a safe farm, 5,000 acre farm, owned by John Hall.
[00:44:39.327 --> 00:44:41.709]  But he had a silent partner.
[00:44:43.041 --> 00:44:46.963]  Now this is pretty dubious stuff, Alex, back in those days.
[00:44:47.063 --> 00:44:48.904]  This is pretty slippery stuff.
[00:44:49.505 --> 00:44:51.786]  Well, guess who his silent partner was?
[00:44:53.587 --> 00:44:54.107]  Poindexter.
[00:44:54.447 --> 00:45:08.655]  Regardless of blatant motive, that investigation isn't stopping President Obama, who can barely contain his power-mad glee, gloating over a possible modification of his lame-duck status resulting from the death of a long-standing Supreme Court Justice.
[00:45:09.316 --> 00:45:10.096]  Appointing judges.
[00:45:10.116 --> 00:45:11.697]  The usual stuff.
[00:45:17.898 --> 00:45:28.365]  Before Scalia's body was even in the ground, Obama was bucking for a replacement, recently listing replacements on a SCOTUS blog titled, A Responsibility I Take Seriously.
[00:45:28.525 --> 00:45:38.692]  Well, the thousands of Americans attending Scalia's funeral could plainly see that the presence of the President at a Supreme Court Justice's funeral wasn't taken very seriously.
[00:45:38.892 --> 00:45:41.014]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:45:54.537 --> 00:45:57.999]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[00:45:58.019 --> 00:46:01.480]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:06.362]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:46:06.382 --> 00:46:09.263]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[00:46:09.383 --> 00:46:15.346]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[00:46:15.546 --> 00:46:19.128]  They print our money and then loan it to us at interest.
[00:46:19.569 --> 00:46:22.150]  The IRS is their collection agency.
[00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:30.775]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[00:46:31.816 --> 00:46:40.562]  ...is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:46:40.662 --> 00:46:45.806]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[00:46:46.326 --> 00:46:49.969]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[00:46:50.089 --> 00:46:52.110]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:54.612]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[00:46:54.672 --> 00:46:57.053]  Know your history and you will know your enemy.
[00:46:57.394 --> 00:46:58.494]  InfoWars.com
[00:47:03.005 --> 00:47:04.007]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.548 --> 00:47:06.832]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.113 --> 00:47:14.966]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:04.363 --> 00:49:09.706]  I want to pull up this clip from Reince Priebus, who is the RNC Chair.
[00:49:10.146 --> 00:49:13.527]  It was an amazing admission, and I want you to look at this carefully.
[00:49:13.547 --> 00:49:15.588]  We're going to have a lot to say about this in the coming days.
[00:49:16.189 --> 00:49:24.853]  He's talking to CNN's Allison Camerota, and she asks him the question, is it time for the GOP to embrace Trump as the frontrunner?
[00:49:25.313 --> 00:49:27.334]  And I want you to hear how he responds.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:36.029]  Let's keep in mind, you asked the question in a way that I think is a little bit... These folks are competing to join us.
[00:49:36.049 --> 00:49:37.791]  I mean, that's what's happening, right?
[00:49:37.831 --> 00:49:41.275]  So they're competing to join the Republican Party.
[00:49:41.295 --> 00:49:42.257]  They're competing to join us.
[00:49:42.297 --> 00:49:44.419]  Depending on what the delegates decide to do.
[00:49:44.439 --> 00:49:45.581]  And he keeps repeating this, listen.
[00:49:46.121 --> 00:49:50.563]  The requisite amount of delegates, or whoever that is, joins us.
[00:49:50.583 --> 00:49:52.584]  That's what they're doing, though.
[00:49:52.604 --> 00:49:55.545]  They're competing to be the nominee of the Republican Party.
[00:49:55.665 --> 00:49:59.627]  Yes, but they're competing to become the President of the United States.
[00:49:59.807 --> 00:50:04.249]  And so they are looking for voters, all voters, to vote for them.
[00:50:04.289 --> 00:50:06.229]  I mean, my point is this, Rod.
[00:50:06.289 --> 00:50:07.090]  No, they're not.
[00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:08.190]  They're competing.
[00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:09.611]  No, we're important.
[00:50:09.671 --> 00:50:10.751]  I haven't been only on my point.
[00:50:11.592 --> 00:50:14.453]  There are two major political parties in America.
[00:50:15.674 --> 00:50:17.055]  Do you get that?
[00:50:17.535 --> 00:50:31.221]  Understand the process that's going on here because Reince Priebus, chair of the RNC, is trying to explain to you that you may think that this is an election for president, but what these people are doing is competing to join them, as he puts it.
[00:50:31.261 --> 00:50:34.762]  And Trump has made it clear he doesn't want to be beholden to the establishment.
[00:50:34.802 --> 00:50:42.226]  Meanwhile, these other guys are going out and their commercials coming out are saying, you want someone who's going to be against the establishment?
[00:50:42.306 --> 00:50:43.306]  Go for Rubio.
[00:50:43.366 --> 00:50:44.727]  Come to the dark side.
[00:50:45.387 --> 00:50:45.768]  Exactly.
[00:50:45.788 --> 00:50:46.809]  Come to the dark side.
[00:50:46.829 --> 00:50:47.549]  What are they doing?
[00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:49.111]  Are they pledging a fraternity?
[00:50:50.132 --> 00:50:52.994]  Are the debates really kind of a hazing process?
[00:50:53.055 --> 00:50:54.316]  It's like Waterborne.
[00:50:54.496 --> 00:50:55.217]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:55.257 --> 00:50:55.877]  That's what Eric said.
[00:50:55.897 --> 00:50:56.618]  It's not even torture.
[00:50:57.078 --> 00:50:58.720]  It's low-level college hazing.
[00:50:59.201 --> 00:51:00.302]  Okay, so here's a question.
[00:51:01.002 --> 00:51:07.725]  Did Rubio and Cruz and Kasich, did they not join the Republican Party when they became senators and governors?
[00:51:07.765 --> 00:51:08.405]  Because that's what it says.
[00:51:08.665 --> 00:51:11.426]  The nominee joins the Republican Party.
[00:51:11.466 --> 00:51:12.126]  That's what's happening.
[00:51:12.386 --> 00:51:13.807]  They're joining us.
[00:51:13.927 --> 00:51:16.868]  And so it's like there is a Republican Party where the voters are.
[00:51:16.988 --> 00:51:19.411]  There's another Republican Party where some of these office holders are.
[00:51:19.671 --> 00:51:22.794]  Then there's the inner circle of the establishment.
[00:51:22.914 --> 00:51:28.059]  It's like there's hunting clubs and then there's hunting clubs.
[00:51:28.099 --> 00:51:35.227]  You might be a hunter but you're not a green wardrobe dancing around the fire with satanic sculptures hunter.
[00:51:35.427 --> 00:51:37.428]  You're looking at Rubio's numbers.
[00:51:37.468 --> 00:51:39.949]  I mean, no one can compare to the amount of people that Trump's bringing.
[00:51:40.289 --> 00:51:44.571]  And if this elite club picks Rubio or Cruz or something, which probably won't happen.
[00:51:44.671 --> 00:51:57.356]  Or if they do a brokered convention, which is what these 200 elite donors in Manhattan were talking about, saying, well, this is the only way we're going to pull this in now, folks, because we are going to be so far behind come Super Tuesday, most likely, because everybody is coalescing.
[00:51:57.376 --> 00:52:04.779]  Look, Rubio in the last one, in Nevada, most of the people who voted for Rubio, their number one reason was electability.
[00:52:05.399 --> 00:52:10.181]  He can't make that case if he's 16 points behind in his own home state as a sitting senator.
[00:52:10.441 --> 00:52:17.504]  Well, David, right now what we've had is we've got the mottliest crew of protesters I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of protests over the years.
[00:52:18.165 --> 00:52:22.887]  And this crew rivals 2008 RNC in St.
[00:52:22.947 --> 00:52:24.067]  Paul, Minneapolis.
[00:52:24.468 --> 00:52:31.331]  That big RNC thing when you had a bunch of poo-flingers loading up their little baggies full of poo and flinging it.
[00:52:32.111 --> 00:52:35.273]  I see a costume character there in the background.
[00:52:35.393 --> 00:52:37.414]  Describe the rest of the people there.
[00:52:37.535 --> 00:52:40.737]  Looks like Marie Antoinette.
[00:52:41.417 --> 00:52:42.077]  It's unbelievable.
[00:52:42.137 --> 00:52:49.062]  It's so ironic because I think a Donald Trump presidency would actually help most of these people's pocketbooks, I think.
[00:52:50.663 --> 00:52:54.926]  It's a combination of Black Lives Matter, open borders,
[00:52:55.886 --> 00:52:58.647]  Uh, you know, pay us $15 an hour to flip a hamburger.
[00:52:58.907 --> 00:52:59.108]  Yeah.
[00:52:59.208 --> 00:53:01.569]  And just endless, yeah, totally just against GOP.
[00:53:01.609 --> 00:53:02.469]  We won't have any jobs.
[00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:05.710]  So, free healthcare, free, uh, free, free everything.
[00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:06.551]  Free college tuition.
[00:53:06.571 --> 00:53:09.452]  Well, and they know there's not going to be any jobs once they graduate, so.
[00:53:10.578 --> 00:53:15.883]  Well, I'll tell you what, maybe a robot will come along and groom their stool or something when they can't do anything else.
[00:53:16.003 --> 00:53:16.824]  You know what?
[00:53:17.064 --> 00:53:22.569]  I'm kind of sick of people like this Telemundo person who's like, tell me what you're going to do for Hispanics.
[00:53:22.609 --> 00:53:25.391]  It's like, you know, stop the division.
[00:53:25.612 --> 00:53:26.452]  It shouldn't be about...
[00:53:27.173 --> 00:53:34.039]  This hyphenated version of America that the media sells us all the time because they want to divide and balkanize this country.
[00:53:34.459 --> 00:53:38.383]  I am sick of Telemundo and the rest of these people who want to come out.
[00:53:38.763 --> 00:53:39.984]  They're trying to create a race war.
[00:53:40.344 --> 00:53:44.408]  You already know what Telemundo is going to ask as soon as they step up to the platform.
[00:53:44.488 --> 00:53:46.650]  You know what question they're going to ask.
[00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:47.110]  Exactly.
[00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:49.472]  Tell me about Hispanics or whatever.
[00:53:49.552 --> 00:53:53.396]  No, talk about what's in the interest of the American people.
[00:53:53.836 --> 00:53:54.857]  The American people.
[00:53:55.137 --> 00:53:55.697]  I don't think so.
[00:54:14.042 --> 00:54:14.342]  Yeah.
[00:54:14.482 --> 00:54:17.023]  They don't want America to become Mexico.
[00:54:17.324 --> 00:54:17.664]  That's right.
[00:54:17.704 --> 00:54:18.704]  They left Mexico.
[00:54:18.984 --> 00:54:20.265]  They left Mexico.
[00:54:20.285 --> 00:54:22.386]  There's a lot of people fleeing all these different countries.
[00:54:22.406 --> 00:54:23.727]  They're going, yeah, we want a border.
[00:54:23.987 --> 00:54:25.187]  We didn't have one back home.
[00:54:25.467 --> 00:54:26.568]  That's why it's gone to hell.
[00:54:26.788 --> 00:54:29.049]  So yeah, we agree with Donald Trump on that aspect.
[00:54:29.089 --> 00:54:30.990]  Well, and it's not just Mexico.
[00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:41.615]  It's a lot of the other countries as well, that Mexico is trying to seal off their southern border from people coming up from these other countries in Central America, that they're trying to seal their border.
[00:54:43.016 --> 00:54:46.119]  So, you know, I hate to say it's just about Mexico because it's not.
[00:54:46.319 --> 00:54:51.565]  I know so many African-American, Hispanic, Arab people who are going to vote for Trump.
[00:54:51.665 --> 00:54:56.691]  Quite a few students yesterday at UT that were Arab and Hispanic said, yeah, we're going to vote for Trump.
[00:54:56.711 --> 00:54:57.211]  Go Trump.
[00:54:57.231 --> 00:54:57.752]  Trump trained.
[00:54:57.892 --> 00:54:59.373]  Yeah, like completely for it.
[00:54:59.413 --> 00:55:18.319]  They're like, hey, go to one of these countries where there's stuff going on, you know, that don't have borders that are collapsing from illegal immigration and tell me how much you want those borders wide open until you've gone and experienced that and you understood what it's like to have someone in your family gang raped by tons of people who are out there who are going to come over and actually be an American.
[00:55:18.499 --> 00:55:19.900]  You don't even know what to talk about.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:24.082]  Until you've been over there and seen what's going on in Europe, you have no idea.
[00:55:24.282 --> 00:55:29.465]  You're just being played by Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders with their BS rhetoric nonstop.
[00:55:29.545 --> 00:55:38.691]  This is going to be interesting because people have said that Ted Cruz really needs to recuse himself from being a part of the Senate Judiciary Committee or even for voting for a possible nominee because...
[00:55:39.831 --> 00:55:49.135]  If he wins, they will be deciding whether or not he is an actual born citizen.
[00:55:49.455 --> 00:55:50.736]  You know what?
[00:55:50.796 --> 00:55:56.458]  We shouldn't have a president who would allow the Supreme Court to erase the Second Amendment.
[00:55:56.498 --> 00:55:58.039]  That's not in the Constitution, Ted.
[00:55:58.419 --> 00:55:59.319]  Shut up about that.
[00:55:59.539 --> 00:56:06.282]  If you don't have a backbone where you can stand up as an executive to the Supreme Court when they try to take away the Constitution, you shouldn't be running.
[00:56:06.302 --> 00:56:07.543]  Of course, you're not eligible anyway.
[00:56:08.609 --> 00:56:15.552]  I'm sick and tired of the demagoguery and I'm sick and tired of presidents who roll over and play dead when the Supreme Court makes an eating.
[00:56:15.732 --> 00:56:18.433]  That's not how you modify the Constitution.
[00:56:18.453 --> 00:56:19.334]  He ought to know that.
[00:56:19.374 --> 00:56:25.917]  But of course, he voted to get rid of the process for ratifying treaties before he voted against it.
[00:56:27.654 --> 00:56:28.374]  He's been on both sides of that.
[00:56:28.394 --> 00:56:32.617]  He also said that he would vote to end the Fed and he didn't show up when his vote was counted.
[00:56:32.657 --> 00:56:33.217]  That's right.
[00:56:33.237 --> 00:56:33.857]  That's right.
[00:56:33.917 --> 00:56:34.918]  Talk is cheap.
[00:56:34.958 --> 00:56:36.078]  Talk is cheap, my friend.
[00:56:36.118 --> 00:56:38.360]  He did that double vote so he could say, well, I've evolved.
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:39.040]  I've changed my mind.
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:42.142]  He was too busy being a jerk to me in a city north of Charleston that night.
[00:56:42.482 --> 00:56:44.303]  You've heard this exchange on religious liberty.
[00:56:44.523 --> 00:56:51.487]  You have said that religious liberty will trump even the ability of people to stay away from same-sex marriages, not provide flowers.
[00:56:51.727 --> 00:56:53.067]  He's not going to read the three parts.
[00:56:53.127 --> 00:56:55.689]  Are you satisfied with this exchange on religious liberty?
[00:56:56.291 --> 00:57:01.775]  Well, I think you ask a very important question because the issue here about the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy.
[00:57:01.835 --> 00:57:04.937]  Justice Scalia... Answer the question.
[00:57:04.957 --> 00:57:06.117]  We know that the next president... Robot.
[00:57:06.157 --> 00:57:06.358]  Robot.
[00:57:06.378 --> 00:57:06.538]  Robot.

[00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:25.090]  Robot
[00:57:26.291 --> 00:57:29.213]  But what would you do?
[00:57:29.874 --> 00:57:33.917]  Is someone keeping a tally of how many questions Marco Rubio has not answered?
[00:57:33.957 --> 00:57:36.339]  They all choose not to answer questions.
[00:57:36.379 --> 00:57:44.285]  He asked him if he's going to make a litmus test on a particular issue and he doesn't answer that, he just attacks Trump.
[00:57:44.305 --> 00:57:46.467]  That's what we need to tweet out right now, Darren.
[00:57:46.507 --> 00:57:51.711]  How many questions has he ducked and dodged?
[00:57:52.192 --> 00:57:53.312]  A good thing that's happening
[00:57:54.582 --> 00:57:59.004]  Is that we're all here tonight, heaping ridicule on these establishment candidates.
[00:57:59.404 --> 00:58:01.625]  We've kissed the rear end of the mainstream media for too long.
[00:58:01.945 --> 00:58:02.805]  We've groveled to them.
[00:58:02.825 --> 00:58:06.406]  We've let the mainstream media pundants, the Donald Trump media, set the narrative.
[00:58:06.446 --> 00:58:09.968]  Let's not forget the reason I'm supporting Trump, and that's with, you know...
[00:58:10.988 --> 00:58:11.189]  Yeah.
[00:58:11.669 --> 00:58:11.810]  Right.
[00:58:26.001 --> 00:58:27.221]  And that's it for our show tonight.
[00:58:27.242 --> 00:58:29.462]  We do encourage you to go to the InfoWars shop.
