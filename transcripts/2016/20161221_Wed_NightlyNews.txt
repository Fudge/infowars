[00:00:20.182 --> 00:00:21.783]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.923 --> 00:00:22.543]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:23.564]  It's Wednesday, December 21st, 2016.
[00:00:23.604 --> 00:00:24.464]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:31.544 --> 00:00:38.426]  A shocking video has surfaced of a mother prepping her young daughters for a suicide bombing.
[00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:42.887]  Meanwhile, the religion of peace strikes again.
[00:00:43.167 --> 00:00:43.967]  But wait a minute.
[00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:45.887]  Don't call it terrorism.
[00:00:46.387 --> 00:00:53.849]  MSNBC's Chris Hayes says it's too early to cast blame on radical Muslim extremists.
[00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:57.910]  And Donald Trump needs to stop with the accusations.
[00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:05.067]  Just to reiterate, the deadly incident has not been declared a terrorist attack by the German authorities themselves as of yet.
[00:01:05.547 --> 00:01:10.608]  Then, the EU has the perfect solution to combat terrorism.
[00:01:11.408 --> 00:01:13.429]  Take away your guns.
[00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:20.931]  All that plus Mexico wants immigrants to the US to apply for American citizenship.
[00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:24.132]  That's up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.347 --> 00:01:36.952]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.
[00:01:37.052 --> 00:01:44.718]  We're making freedom go viral, and now we are proud to announce a new weapon in the epic battle against the globalists.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:01.638 --> 00:03:08.104]  Well, the day after, or two days after, we see a semi-trailer, as we call it in the United States, in Britain they call it an articulated lorry.
[00:03:08.785 --> 00:03:14.351]  After we see that used to attack people, now we see the EU wanting to ban semi-automatic guns.
[00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:17.154]  As you know, it was a semi-trailer that was used, I guess.
[00:03:17.214 --> 00:03:20.116]  I don't know what they're thinking, but we do know what they're thinking, don't we?
[00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:31.286]  We know that they want to use the Islamic terror that they're bringing in amongst us to take away our freedoms, to create emergencies, and now we see the results of this on Infowars.com.
[00:03:31.306 --> 00:03:36.110]  We have an article, EU pushes gun control in response to Islamic terrorism in Europe.
[00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:48.033]  The 28 members of the European Union have reached a preliminary agreement to implement a near-total ban on semi-automatic firearms, claiming it is a necessary step to reduce the likelihood of terror attacks.
[00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:54.515]  Maybe they should ban the terrorists from coming in rather than the guns, because they're not going to be able to keep it out of their hands.
[00:03:54.555 --> 00:04:05.759]  I point out, the European Commission announced a political agreement between the European Parliament and 28 member states of the European Union to tighten already stringent gun control laws by banning high-capacity firearms.
[00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:06.059]  And again,
[00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:20.908]  We see the same thing being done again and again by the types of jurisdictions like we have here in America and Chicago and New York where they have the highest gun crime in Chicago and yet they think they can solve it by adding more prohibitions for guns.
[00:04:20.968 --> 00:04:27.532]  No, it doesn't work to prohibit guns any more than it stops people from getting to drugs by creating drug prohibition.
[00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:32.856]  The left and the right need to come together and understand the futility of prohibition.
[00:04:33.516 --> 00:04:38.159]  They say this includes a ban on, of course, automatic firearms that are converted into semi-automatic firearms and other things.
[00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:41.281]  But listen to the other parts of the agreement here.
[00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:42.883]  They're going to ban the regulation.
[00:04:42.903 --> 00:04:45.564]  They're going to regulate alarm and acoustic weapons.
[00:04:46.225 --> 00:04:56.012]  So I guess you're not going to be able to have an alarm that you can pull out of your purse to get people to turn around and look and hopefully help you with their bare hands.
[00:04:56.512 --> 00:04:58.213]  Maybe they're going to ban pepper spray as well.
[00:04:58.253 --> 00:04:58.673]  I don't know.
[00:04:59.094 --> 00:05:00.415]  Keep you completely defenseless.
[00:05:01.295 --> 00:05:05.878]  If they're going to ban the principle of self-defense, then this is where it's going to end up.
[00:05:06.078 --> 00:05:12.561]  They say they're also going to regulate deactivated weapons, so if the weapon can't even fire, they're going to take it away.
[00:05:12.621 --> 00:05:14.162]  See, this is a cultural move.
[00:05:14.562 --> 00:05:16.563]  They want people to be afraid of guns.
[00:05:16.643 --> 00:05:18.444]  They want guns to be totally alien to people.
[00:05:18.824 --> 00:05:23.007]  They don't even want you to see them in a historical deactivated process.
[00:05:23.127 --> 00:05:26.829]  And they're going to, of course, exchange information between member states.
[00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:29.250]  This has been developing for a long time.
[00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.711]  This is the UN agenda.
[00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:45.861]  Remember, the United Nations created the War on Drugs agenda, the four schedules, and put all the drugs into those schedules in 1961, ten years before Richard Nixon declared a war on drugs, and just copied all of their agenda, all of their regulations.
[00:05:46.422 --> 00:05:48.003]  And this is what this is about.
[00:05:48.283 --> 00:05:51.765]  Going back to 2012, of course, we had the UN Arms Trade Treaty.
[00:05:52.245 --> 00:05:56.108]  They were trying to push that through, especially because the United States was reluctant to do it.
[00:05:56.148 --> 00:05:58.009]  The rest of the world was happy to go along with that.
[00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:05.614]  That was going to give them increased powers to track us, to track our possession and transfer of guns.
[00:06:06.678 --> 00:06:09.299]  They laid the groundwork for this with Fast and Furious.
[00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:13.741]  That was what was supposed to get public opinion moving in that direction.
[00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:17.823]  And of course, it blew up in their face when an agent of the government was killed.
[00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:19.924]  We found out that it was a false flag.
[00:06:20.004 --> 00:06:24.365]  But that was supposed to lay the groundwork for the UN Arms Trade Treaty back in 2012.
[00:06:25.046 --> 00:06:26.926]  They have not given up on that agenda.
[00:06:27.407 --> 00:06:32.289]  And we need to understand as we look at this, and we'll look at this terror attack, what is really going on here.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:41.829]  is we have self-loathing suicidal white liberals who cannot wait to just eradicate themselves.
[00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:49.496]  And many of these people, and Germany is a good example, it began there because of their rightful guilt about the Nazis, but they did the wrong thing.
[00:06:50.057 --> 00:06:52.599]  What they should have done is they should have repudiated the Nazis.
[00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:55.182]  Instead, what they have done is embrace Nazi policies.
[00:06:55.202 --> 00:06:55.903]  You think I'm kidding?
[00:06:56.843 --> 00:07:05.491]  Adolf Hitler, the first thing he did was to ban private firearms because he didn't want any opposition to his goons in the streets.
[00:07:05.531 --> 00:07:08.013]  He didn't want people to be able to protect themselves from the Nazis.
[00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:15.339]  And of course, as we saw in the Warsaw Ghetto, just one person with a hammer getting a pistol from the Nazis, and then it spread from there.
[00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:18.022]  They started taking the guns from the Nazis who had surrounded them.
[00:07:18.522 --> 00:07:26.047]  And they tied down a panzer division, or maybe more than a panzer division, for a very long time until they burned the entire city down.
[00:07:26.067 --> 00:07:32.951]  So anybody that says that you can't resist tyranny with a pistol or with a hammer, they need to go back and look at the Warsaw Resistance.
[00:07:32.971 --> 00:07:34.632]  They need to go back and look at Adolf Hitler.
[00:07:34.952 --> 00:07:38.815]  They need to repudiate Nazism instead of standing with it.
[00:07:39.235 --> 00:07:41.176]  And that's what the European Union is doing now.
[00:07:41.216 --> 00:07:42.277]  But of course the European Union
[00:07:42.537 --> 00:07:42.837]  I think so.
[00:08:03.894 --> 00:08:06.816]  Which will help prevent the acquisition of firearms by terrorists.
[00:08:06.836 --> 00:08:11.559]  Well, why not, as I said before, have tighter controls on terrorists coming in?
[00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:13.941]  You have no way to vet these people.
[00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:18.564]  And we look at the absolute, total ineffectiveness of the German police.
[00:08:18.624 --> 00:08:21.606]  These people look like keystone cops.
[00:08:22.267 --> 00:08:30.893]  And as I pointed out yesterday in the report that I filed, if you go back to the 1972 Munich Olympics, where you had Islamic terrorists capture the Israeli team there,
[00:08:31.753 --> 00:08:33.154]  Held them hostage for 20 hours.
[00:08:33.214 --> 00:08:34.835]  The Germans tried to negotiate something.
[00:08:34.855 --> 00:08:35.656]  They thought they had a deal.
[00:08:36.096 --> 00:08:41.881]  Eventually all the terrorists were, all the hostages were killed, but not before they tortured them.
[00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:45.383]  And the German government held that information secret.
[00:08:45.403 --> 00:08:48.345]  Held it from the public to protect their incompetence.
[00:08:48.906 --> 00:08:50.327]  They held it for 43 years.
[00:08:50.867 --> 00:08:51.968]  It only came out last year.
[00:08:52.008 --> 00:08:53.930]  Of course, that was back in 1972 that it happened.
[00:08:54.350 --> 00:09:00.595]  And the tragedy, as we're going to see in this next story, is the personal tragedy that's behind this kind of government incompetence.
[00:09:01.395 --> 00:09:15.161]  As the widow of the weightlifter who was castrated in front of the other hostages and then killed said when she saw the pictures finally in 2015 she said it erased the memory that she had of her husband.
[00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:21.284]  She said all I remembered of him was his smiling face and dimples and now I can't see anything but that last picture that I saw of him.
[00:09:22.031 --> 00:09:29.918]  And as I point out in this article, and this is a quote from a minister, an expert in Europe.
[00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:42.268]  He says, if a radicalized fanatic decides to use a truck as a weapon, you don't stand a chance unless you know about him and about his plans in advance and you arrest him before he can act.
[00:09:42.528 --> 00:09:44.530]  Or maybe you keep him out of the country to start with.
[00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.872]  See, they're trying to lay the groundwork for a police state.
[00:09:47.512 --> 00:09:51.814]  That's what we all as libertarians need to push back as equally as hard against that.
[00:09:51.914 --> 00:09:52.914]  We do not want a police state.
[00:09:52.934 --> 00:09:54.835]  We're going to talk about that later in the broadcast as well.
[00:09:55.415 --> 00:09:58.056]  But he's saying if he wants to use a truck, you're not going to be able to stop him.
[00:09:58.096 --> 00:10:04.939]  He says it's impossible to check all vehicles in the EU or to seal off all Christmas markets to protect them from any danger.
[00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:07.200]  Don't worry, they're going to try both of those things.
[00:10:07.944 --> 00:10:15.305]  They're very busy on their plans to ban private ownership and human drivers of cars.
[00:10:15.645 --> 00:10:18.086]  And they are long down that road.
[00:10:18.146 --> 00:10:19.886]  And that's the next argument they're going to give us.
[00:10:20.546 --> 00:10:26.527]  That's another part of why you're seeing these types of terrorist events happening with big semi-trailers.
[00:10:27.388 --> 00:10:28.808]  Now, I want to take a look at this.
[00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:30.348]  We talked about this earlier on the day.
[00:10:30.388 --> 00:10:33.169]  I came on the Alex Jones Show and Alex and I talked about this.
[00:10:33.969 --> 00:10:35.149]  This incredibly
[00:10:36.462 --> 00:10:44.090]  Disturbing, sad film of a jihadi mom who has been totally brainwashed into this death cult.
[00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:50.457]  She has herself dressed all in black as the angel of death or as, you know, the Grim Reaper.
[00:10:51.158 --> 00:10:54.641]  And she is kissing her seven and nine-year-old daughters goodbye.
[00:10:55.908 --> 00:11:09.792]  And this surfaced after there was a seven-year-old girl who went into a Syrian police station, we reported on this yesterday, went into a Syrian police station and had a suicide vest on and it was detonated by remote control.
[00:11:09.812 --> 00:11:12.753]  So somebody in this sick cult of death
[00:11:13.413 --> 00:11:14.253]  Which is Islam.
[00:11:15.053 --> 00:11:19.554]  Sends this little girl into the police station, and then detonates that.
[00:11:19.734 --> 00:11:26.616]  And this is the mother, so proud to send her seven and nine year old daughters off to be killed and to kill other people.
[00:11:26.676 --> 00:11:27.636]  See, that's what they're proud of.
[00:11:28.276 --> 00:11:35.198]  And as I looked at this, and I talked to Alex earlier today, I said, you know, why is it that the left loves Islam so much?
[00:11:37.018 --> 00:11:47.025]  That says that they're for women, that they're for LGBT, that they are for all these other issues that they want to protect, and yet, these are the people for the children.
[00:11:47.265 --> 00:11:48.125]  They want to protect the children.
[00:11:48.145 --> 00:11:51.427]  They're always telling us they're going to do regulations to protect the children.
[00:11:51.467 --> 00:11:53.048]  That's why we have to surrender our freedoms, right?
[00:11:53.729 --> 00:11:55.770]  And yet, they support this group.
[00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:03.135]  And as I was thinking about it during the day, I thought about the time we went to the abortion clinic here to protest, the time my wife was there.
[00:12:03.695 --> 00:12:04.896]  And she got that guy on camera.
[00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:07.811]  And he said, I kill my kids.
[00:12:08.412 --> 00:12:09.593]  And I thought, that's it.
[00:12:10.413 --> 00:12:14.877]  That's the common ground that the authoritarian left has with Islam.
[00:12:15.198 --> 00:12:18.540]  They kill their kids and they use them to kill your kids.
[00:12:19.201 --> 00:12:20.742]  It is a sick cult of death.
[00:12:20.762 --> 00:12:26.347]  And I'm not just talking about Islam, but I'm talking about the sick Democrats who support them as well.
[00:12:27.088 --> 00:12:36.494]  And I want to take a look at MSNBC's Chris Hayes and how he tried to push back and criticize Donald Trump for telling it like it is.
[00:12:36.854 --> 00:12:38.335]  Here's a clip of Chris Hayes.
[00:12:39.879 --> 00:12:44.342]  Oh, hold it right there.
[00:12:45.383 --> 00:12:46.504]  Hold it right there.
[00:12:46.744 --> 00:12:48.345]  They don't know if it was deliberate.
[00:12:48.825 --> 00:12:57.271]  The guy takes... Okay, witnesses immediately said, and I had people push back on Twitter against me for saying this, it's Islamic terrorism.
[00:12:57.311 --> 00:12:58.392]  Yeah, we know it is.
[00:12:58.472 --> 00:13:01.314]  It's a copycat of the French attack.
[00:13:01.954 --> 00:13:03.375]  And they don't know if it was deliberate.
[00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:09.041]  He drove 40 miles an hour for a sustained period of time through a hundred people.
[00:13:09.441 --> 00:13:10.702]  Twelve of them are dead already.
[00:13:10.842 --> 00:13:15.787]  But we don't know, says Chris Hayes, Fake News MSNBC, if it was deliberate or not.
[00:13:15.807 --> 00:13:20.231]  But let's listen to the rest of the lies from this guy who is Rachel Maddow's doppelganger.
[00:13:20.311 --> 00:13:21.312]  Let's go back to Chris Hayes.
[00:13:23.114 --> 00:13:30.961]  Okay, hold it right there.
[00:13:31.501 --> 00:13:32.102]  Hold it right there.
[00:13:32.122 --> 00:13:32.662]  Yeah.
[00:13:33.123 --> 00:13:34.043]  See, we don't know.
[00:13:34.404 --> 00:13:39.588]  ISIS claimed credit for that, but as Chris Hayes says, we don't know that that was Islam.
[00:13:40.088 --> 00:13:47.614]  Who else in the world takes pride in the massacre of innocent people because they're a different religion than you?
[00:13:48.075 --> 00:13:49.476]  No one other than Islam.
[00:13:49.516 --> 00:13:51.497]  Let's go back to his lies here.
[00:13:53.669 --> 00:13:55.431]  Trump responded to what happened today in a statement.
[00:14:11.872 --> 00:14:17.557]  Just to reiterate, the deadly incident has not been declared a terrorist attack by the German authorities themselves as of yet.
[00:14:17.577 --> 00:14:18.177]  Hold it right there.
[00:14:18.217 --> 00:14:18.898]  Hold it right there.
[00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:19.098]  Yeah.
[00:14:19.238 --> 00:14:28.726]  Unless the government pronounces it a terrorism attack, do not use your mind and your reason and your senses to understand what's going on here.
[00:14:29.046 --> 00:14:29.306]  Okay?
[00:14:29.707 --> 00:14:32.489]  And Donald Trump is a bad guy for telling you that.
[00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:34.971]  That is absolutely amazing.
[00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:39.955]  The rest of that clip, and we're not going to play it, he goes in and he shows the assassination in Turkey.
[00:14:40.035 --> 00:14:40.456]  Same day.
[00:14:41.348 --> 00:14:44.109]  Again, the religion as a death cult.
[00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:51.233]  And remember, when you talk about gun control, where we started this whole broadcast talking about the European Union saying they're going to step up gun control.
[00:14:52.053 --> 00:14:56.635]  Who was the individual who shot the Russian ambassador in Istanbul?
[00:14:57.556 --> 00:14:59.297]  It was a Turkish policeman.
[00:15:00.151 --> 00:15:02.473]  Turkish policeman who was trained as part of their special forces.
[00:15:03.033 --> 00:15:07.256]  See, you cannot give all of the guns to the government.
[00:15:07.857 --> 00:15:10.659]  They, first of all, if they're good guys, they can't be everywhere.
[00:15:10.939 --> 00:15:12.740]  They can't be everywhere and stop everything.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:24.168]  And going back to that situation in the French Riviera, they stopped that terrorist attack by a policeman who was there, a policewoman actually, who shot that driver and stopped him, killed him.
[00:15:24.589 --> 00:15:25.449]  That's how they stopped it.
[00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.171]  A good person with a gun.
[00:15:28.154 --> 00:15:30.375]  And there weren't any good people with guns in Germany.
[00:15:30.815 --> 00:15:37.219]  And so they had some people who said they witnessed this person who was arrested getting out of the cab and running away.
[00:15:37.299 --> 00:15:39.240]  They filmed him with their camera.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.600]  They called with their phone.
[00:15:40.621 --> 00:15:41.461]  They called the police.
[00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:42.942]  He was subsequently arrested.
[00:15:42.982 --> 00:15:49.285]  And then the prosecutors and the police chief, the authorities, came in and said, well, we don't think he's the right guy.
[00:15:49.325 --> 00:15:49.965]  Maybe he's not.
[00:15:50.165 --> 00:15:50.646]  I don't know.
[00:15:51.451 --> 00:16:02.360]  Nevertheless, when we look at the history of the German government, when we look at the lies that have been told to us by the establishment press, I have my doubts as to whether or not they let the... maybe there were other people involved.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.944]  But let's take a look at what happened just in the last week in the Netherlands.
[00:16:07.845 --> 00:16:14.111]  Gert Wilders was found guilty of insulting a group after a hate speech trial, and I want to tell you what he did.
[00:16:14.151 --> 00:16:16.473]  Now, this is the way CNN reports it, the fake news CNN.
[00:16:16.493 --> 00:16:18.996]  They say the Dutch far-right opposition leader.
[00:16:19.016 --> 00:16:20.317]  Well, I don't know that he's far-right.
[00:16:20.377 --> 00:16:27.143]  I know that they label everybody that is not part of the authoritarian, open-border globalist left as far-right to them.
[00:16:27.924 --> 00:16:34.888]  But Gert Wilders, they say, was convicted of inciting discrimination and insulting a group after a trial over statements he made about Moroccans.
[00:16:34.908 --> 00:16:35.729]  What did he say?
[00:16:36.269 --> 00:16:45.994]  As part of a political speech about immigration policy, he asked his audience, do you want more or less Moroccans in this city and in the Netherlands?
[00:16:46.074 --> 00:16:47.875]  And the audience repeatedly chanted, less.
[00:16:48.076 --> 00:16:51.538]  The court said that Wilders singled out an entire group of citizens.
[00:16:52.418 --> 00:16:54.359]  And that the message came through loud and clear.
[00:16:54.379 --> 00:16:57.459]  It convicted him of insulting a group and incitement to discrimination.
[00:16:57.799 --> 00:17:02.861]  Well, there's a message that came out loud and clear from the Dutch government, and that is that they are opposed to free speech.
[00:17:03.341 --> 00:17:05.241]  They support authoritarian censorship.
[00:17:05.281 --> 00:17:06.482]  That's the message that we get from them.
[00:17:06.502 --> 00:17:08.362]  And he points out, it was politically motivated.
[00:17:08.382 --> 00:17:18.385]  He said, the PVV hating judges, that's his political party, said they hate us, just declared Moroccans a race and convicted me, as well as half of the Dutch population.
[00:17:18.945 --> 00:17:21.727]  He has previously called Islamic immigration an invasion.
[00:17:21.928 --> 00:17:22.648]  Exactly right!
[00:17:22.928 --> 00:17:23.609]  Exactly right!
[00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:29.914]  He said it is an invasion that will replace our people and erase our culture.
[00:17:29.954 --> 00:17:32.256]  He spoke the truth to power and they're punishing him.
[00:17:32.997 --> 00:17:37.120]  Actually, they didn't actually do any punishment to him, but they convicted him to put that out there.
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.602]  And then they said, well, we'll stay the punishment.
[00:17:39.623 --> 00:17:40.603]  He also said this.
[00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:46.889]  He said, worldwide a movement has started that is making short shrift of the politically correct doctrines of the elite
[00:17:47.529 --> 00:17:52.651]  And their subordinate media like Chris Hayes, MSNBC, CNN, etc, etc.
[00:17:52.991 --> 00:17:53.972]  He said Brexit proved it.
[00:17:54.432 --> 00:17:55.612]  The American election proved it.
[00:17:56.113 --> 00:17:59.134]  He said neither he nor his supporters were racist.
[00:17:59.614 --> 00:18:06.097]  He said they are people who want their country back and who are sick and tired of not being listened to.
[00:18:06.657 --> 00:18:08.818]  That is precisely what is going on.
[00:18:10.137 --> 00:18:14.619]  And as we look at this article here from the, one final article as we're about out of time.
[00:18:15.519 --> 00:18:18.900]  Today the Mexican ambassador urged immigrants to apply for US citizenship.
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:19.741]  Now think about this.
[00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:22.542]  We call them, they want to be called undocumented workers.
[00:18:22.642 --> 00:18:25.543]  I say, instead of illegal alien, let's call them what they are.
[00:18:25.803 --> 00:18:27.544]  Foreign citizens who are here illegally.
[00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:29.505]  These are citizens of Mexico.
[00:18:29.765 --> 00:18:33.728]  The Mexican ambassador is telling them, do this to remain in the United States.
[00:18:33.828 --> 00:18:36.490]  He said that he's urging more Mexican citizens.
[00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:37.630]  This is the way the Hill reports it.
[00:18:37.971 --> 00:18:45.455]  Foreign citizens, here illegally, the Mexican ambassador, in an act of war, quite frankly, is urging them to apply for U.S.
[00:18:45.496 --> 00:18:47.537]  citizenship ahead of the Trump administration.
[00:18:47.557 --> 00:18:53.781]  He says, well, very important protection actions to become citizens, because then they're no longer subject to deportation processes.
[00:18:54.201 --> 00:18:56.723]  On the other hand, they still don't lose their Mexican citizenship.
[00:19:01.971 --> 00:19:16.407]  Three years ago, the Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act repealed the law that had been on the books for decades, barring the CIA and other agencies from engaging in domestic propaganda and disinformation.
[00:19:17.734 --> 00:19:36.358]  Over the weekend, they passed the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act that funds 160 plus million dollars to this new organization that will, quote, discover and counter with its own disinformation, alternative media that they dub fake news.
[00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:52.010]  At the very same time, we see mainstream media claiming that Trump, myself, Tucker Carlson, you name it, are Russian agents, and that the American people really wanted Hillary Clinton, but the Russians somehow hacked in, and that's why Trump won.
[00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:56.173]  Yes, we've gotten Trump elected, but they're openly trying to overthrow that.
[00:19:57.034 --> 00:20:00.379]  Now more than ever, InfoWars needs your prayers and your support.
[00:20:00.439 --> 00:20:06.106]  And I need you to take the articles and the videos that are on the site and realize you're the reason we're having such an effect.

[00:20:22.612 --> 00:20:34.215]  And I am extremely thankful to all of you that have prayed for us, that have spread the word about the broadcast, that have supported us, that have defended us, and that have financially supported us.

[00:22:58.524 --> 00:23:06.006]  Hey fellow white guys.
[00:23:06.186 --> 00:23:11.988]  First off, try to recognize that America was never great for anyone who wasn't a white guy.
[00:23:12.148 --> 00:23:14.088]  Also, Blue Lives Matter isn't a thing.
[00:23:14.348 --> 00:23:15.849]  Cops weren't born with blue skin.
[00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:17.469]  Stop bragging about being woke.
[00:23:17.769 --> 00:23:18.889]  Stop saying woke.
[00:23:19.169 --> 00:23:21.730]  Learn what mansplaining is, and then stop doing it.
[00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:23.270]  Feel free to take Kanye West though.
[00:23:23.771 --> 00:23:24.631]  You guys can have him.
[00:23:24.911 --> 00:23:25.791]  You know what you did, Kanye.
[00:23:27.699 --> 00:23:30.241]  Nobody who has black friends says that they have black friends.
[00:23:30.461 --> 00:23:33.143]  And just because you have black friends doesn't mean you're not racist.
[00:23:33.523 --> 00:23:34.844]  You can be racist with black friends.
[00:23:35.044 --> 00:23:36.285]  Some of you guys do a great job.
[00:23:37.126 --> 00:23:37.746]  Some of you don't.
[00:23:38.086 --> 00:23:41.128]  All right, and that was the overtly racist video from MTV.
[00:23:41.188 --> 00:23:44.731]  I'm now joined by former MTV VJ Adam Curry.
[00:23:45.251 --> 00:23:49.014]  Adam, what is your first reaction when you saw that yesterday making the rounds?
[00:23:49.034 --> 00:23:51.916]  It got a ton of down votes from MTV, but what are they thinking?
[00:23:52.492 --> 00:23:54.533]  And I think they actually, they took it down now.
[00:23:54.593 --> 00:23:56.833]  I think they took it down, they put it back up, they took it down.
[00:23:57.213 --> 00:24:03.215]  You know, when I first started, obviously intellectually I'm insulted because I mean, come on, it's all white guy's fault as usual.
[00:24:04.516 --> 00:24:12.518]  But I was thinking that in my lifetime, and this is true for the music business as well as it's true for comedy as an example.
[00:24:13.158 --> 00:24:17.583]  People fought so hard, they went to jail for freedom of speech.
[00:24:18.624 --> 00:24:23.850]  We fought hard at MTV back in the day to have certain videos played, to have certain lyrics not censored.
[00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.533]  Comedians, you know, went to jail over things they said.
[00:24:27.874 --> 00:24:32.399]  And now we've come full circle and here we are with MTV telling us to shut up?
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.261]  Totally bizarre.
[00:24:35.185 --> 00:24:36.366]  Yeah, it is amazing.
[00:24:36.406 --> 00:24:36.766]  And they did.
[00:24:36.806 --> 00:24:40.148]  They took it down once when it was getting a bunch of downvotes and they tried to stick it back up.
[00:24:40.288 --> 00:24:41.548]  And then it got more downvotes.
[00:24:41.588 --> 00:24:45.971]  I think the last count I saw was 27,000 downvotes and maybe a few hundred upvotes.
[00:24:46.351 --> 00:24:53.835]  And then finally, RealClearPolitics is reporting that they deleted YouTube video telling white guys what they could do better in 2017.
[00:24:54.355 --> 00:25:00.899]  So we really are, this whole fake news narrative, we've really been able to dismantle it over and over again.
[00:25:00.919 --> 00:25:02.640]  And I wouldn't say this is fake news, but just
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.481]  Some of the things they said in there are fake, you know?
[00:25:05.501 --> 00:25:09.464]  Well, you know what's crazy, Rob, is, you know, this is the moral compass of MTV.
[00:25:09.524 --> 00:25:17.529]  The same people who bring you 16 and pregnant, they're gonna tell me that I need to shut up and I need to do better and I need to not do certain things?
[00:25:17.869 --> 00:25:20.611]  Please, that is the most hypocritical thing I've ever heard of.
[00:25:20.871 --> 00:25:22.253]  Yeah, I mean, just look at the Jersey Shore.
[00:25:22.273 --> 00:25:31.985]  It was legitimizing this party atmosphere, not really doing anything with your life, just being one of these beach bum type people that, you know, they had to go get jobs, but they weren't even good at doing their jobs.
[00:25:32.045 --> 00:25:35.069]  It just showed, hey, if you slack off and drink a lot, you could be a big star.
[00:25:35.785 --> 00:25:43.728]  And I think the history books will show down the road that it was not the videos that MTV used to play that corrupted the youth of America.
[00:25:44.108 --> 00:25:50.170]  And by the way, I think it's a totally fine business decision they made when they said, okay, no more videos are going to long form programming.
[00:25:50.511 --> 00:25:52.651]  It turned them into a $4 billion a year brand.
[00:25:52.691 --> 00:25:53.872]  So there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:25:54.012 --> 00:25:55.773]  But how did they do it?
[00:25:56.213 --> 00:25:58.874]  And what did they, what kind of content and programming did they do it with?
[00:25:58.974 --> 00:25:59.354]  And Ford,
[00:25:59.634 --> 00:26:08.817]  MTV to get on their high horse and talk about morality and what white men should or shouldn't do, it truly baffles the mind.
[00:26:09.257 --> 00:26:11.357]  Now, what years were you there in MTV?
[00:26:11.377 --> 00:26:14.918]  I remember seeing you, you know, when it first launched, but how long were you there in MTV?
[00:26:15.439 --> 00:26:16.479]  I was not one of the first.
[00:26:17.499 --> 00:26:18.099]  I came in around 86.
[00:26:18.579 --> 00:26:25.421]  It launched in 81, but in 87 is when we went full on basic cable.
[00:26:25.861 --> 00:26:27.402]  So you were pretty much... That's when I saw it.
[00:26:27.982 --> 00:26:35.587]  Yeah, and there were some things that came along with that because when you're on basic cable, you have to be very, you know, you have to be a little bit careful about what you show and what you do.
[00:26:36.048 --> 00:26:45.574]  And again, everybody, including the executives, fought very hard to not, you know, to get things through and to, you know, to basically thwart Tipper Gore.
[00:26:45.634 --> 00:26:51.078]  If anyone remembers that, the crazy lyrics of Twisted Sister, they were all going to corrupt the youth of America.
[00:26:51.398 --> 00:26:57.462]  Well, maybe it was Twisted Sister, but the example we see in that video from MTV is the corrupted youth of America.
[00:26:58.242 --> 00:26:58.603]  Exactly.
[00:26:58.643 --> 00:26:59.744]  And I remember those hearings.
[00:27:00.344 --> 00:27:02.686]  John Denver was speaking on behalf of the First Amendment.
[00:27:02.706 --> 00:27:03.367]  Frank Zappa.
[00:27:03.407 --> 00:27:07.471]  You really got this wide array of artists coming out saying, listen, don't mess with this.
[00:27:08.231 --> 00:27:09.072]  That's going to screw up.
[00:27:09.092 --> 00:27:09.773]  And you can see it now.
[00:27:09.833 --> 00:27:10.974]  They're trying to still do it.
[00:27:11.054 --> 00:27:14.497]  The government's still trying to put their hands in what we can and can't say.
[00:27:14.517 --> 00:27:15.338]  And it keeps backfiring.
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:28.508]  And with fake news, this whole idea of coming up with organizations that will determine what is or what isn't right, true, fake, false, whatever, it really is beginnings of
[00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.011]  Restriction on speech.
[00:27:33.511 --> 00:27:35.172]  That's exactly what it is.
[00:27:35.252 --> 00:27:42.635]  And I think last time I was on with Alex and we talked about this whole notion of being verified, which is where this starts.
[00:27:42.655 --> 00:27:43.796]  You're verified on Twitter.
[00:27:44.156 --> 00:27:45.397]  You're verified on Facebook.
[00:27:45.497 --> 00:27:49.079]  Therefore, what you say is already going to have a little leg up.
[00:27:49.099 --> 00:27:50.199]  You're going to be verified.
[00:27:50.479 --> 00:27:53.821]  We'll have the same with news stories, with any story, actually.
[00:27:54.221 --> 00:27:57.642]  But with that, with becoming verified, it's also going to put them in that shell.
[00:27:57.702 --> 00:28:00.403]  It's like, oh, you're verified, you have to follow these rules.
[00:28:00.584 --> 00:28:02.704]  Now, you can't say this, you can't do this.
[00:28:03.185 --> 00:28:04.365]  Now, I want to get to this news.
[00:28:04.385 --> 00:28:08.447]  This is on the Daily Mail today, and this just chuckled me, and probably my favorite news story of the year.
[00:28:08.947 --> 00:28:11.908]  Exclusive Facebook fact checker who arbitrated on fake news.
[00:28:12.928 --> 00:28:16.690]  They made these people at Snopes like the arbiters of what's real and what's not.
[00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:25.151]  They've been accused of defrauding one of the owners of defrauding the website to pay for prostitutes and its staff includes an escort porn star and vice vixen Dom.
[00:28:26.684 --> 00:28:27.384]  What do you make of that?
[00:28:27.884 --> 00:28:34.007]  Well, I'll say, first of all, having grown up in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, I have no problem with prostitution.
[00:28:34.587 --> 00:28:41.750]  If it's in the Netherlands, it was legal, it was sanctioned, it was done properly, everyone was protected, got healthcare, benefits, etc.
[00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:42.850]  They got taxes out of it.
[00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:43.611]  Taxes, of course.
[00:28:43.651 --> 00:28:45.591]  I have no problem with it on that basis either.
[00:28:45.651 --> 00:28:46.692]  No problem at all.
[00:28:48.153 --> 00:29:06.145]  But Snopes being the number two on the list, Rob, for the International Fact Check Organization with Associated Press, I think it was ABC News, Snopes, and then Associated Press, they are the ones, they are the bastions of reality who are going to tell us what is and what is not fake news.
[00:29:06.165 --> 00:29:10.708]  And for this to come out, the timing is, of course, suspect, as you could expect.
[00:29:10.748 --> 00:29:13.130]  I'm not quite sure how this broke or how it came out.
[00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:14.490]  But it doesn't surprise me.
[00:29:14.991 --> 00:29:16.371]  Everybody's got something.
[00:29:16.411 --> 00:29:17.392]  We all got something to hide.
[00:29:17.632 --> 00:29:20.533]  Which is exactly why you should never say, I have nothing to hide.
[00:29:20.893 --> 00:29:21.413]  Exactly.
[00:29:21.554 --> 00:29:27.736]  And I personally think it was the wife, Barbara Mickelson, who they actually show a picture of her in this.
[00:29:27.776 --> 00:29:29.197]  She looks like she's lost a little weight.
[00:29:29.677 --> 00:29:31.939]  She's probably changing her life and where she's going.
[00:29:31.979 --> 00:29:33.440]  Her and Dave didn't get along, whatever.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.102]  They divorced in 2015.
[00:29:35.522 --> 00:29:36.343]  He wanted a raise.
[00:29:36.383 --> 00:29:37.884]  He was bilking money out of the company.
[00:29:38.425 --> 00:29:41.567]  At least that's what it says in these court documents that has been filed.
[00:29:41.907 --> 00:29:42.968]  But it's just interesting.
[00:29:43.489 --> 00:29:47.832]  These are supposed to be the people that are telling us what is real and what is fake.
[00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:52.396]  And they're behind the scenes doing stuff that's a little sleazy, if you ask me.
[00:29:53.257 --> 00:29:56.560]  If you can defraud your company for $100,000,
[00:29:58.956 --> 00:29:59.997]  Where were they making this money?
[00:30:00.037 --> 00:30:01.077]  What were they making that on?
[00:30:01.097 --> 00:30:04.719]  Was it just pure banner ads and stuff like that?
[00:30:04.819 --> 00:30:08.640]  Or are they beholden perhaps to advertisers?
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.401]  I'm not exactly sure how their income works.
[00:30:11.461 --> 00:30:12.982]  Or did they get their income from somewhere else?
[00:30:14.358 --> 00:30:15.019]  Who knows?
[00:30:15.139 --> 00:30:16.860]  Right now they are the Ministry of Truth.
[00:30:17.261 --> 00:30:23.746]  And one more organization, it's a mail order college where they have one building and you can also get your degree online.
[00:30:23.826 --> 00:30:26.549]  They're also going to be one of the groups and I think they're funded by Soros.
[00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:29.992]  So it's really interesting how Soros has its tentacles and everything once again.
[00:30:30.512 --> 00:30:34.314]  You know, I looked into all of the Soros stuff and it is endless.
[00:30:34.454 --> 00:30:43.338]  If you look at all the little organizations that he's funding, anywhere from, you know, a million dollars to three million dollars annually, these companies that these usually nonprofits do.
[00:30:43.738 --> 00:30:44.959]  It's phenomenal.
[00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:48.881]  He really does have his hands everywhere and it's not good.
[00:30:48.901 --> 00:30:48.941]  No.
[00:30:50.241 --> 00:30:58.863]  And so he funds like the Clinton Foundation, and then I saw, I actually heard on your show, the No Agenda Show, that they funded David Brock, got him started with Media Matters.
[00:30:58.963 --> 00:30:59.683]  I didn't even know.
[00:30:59.964 --> 00:31:13.727]  Yes, yeah, well it was the Clintons initially who paid for all of it, and you know, he's finally going to try and get a commercial venture off the ground, which I think is called something ShareBlue or something like that, and I don't know if that's really going to work or not.
[00:31:14.207 --> 00:31:15.088]  Bad hair day news?
[00:31:17.671 --> 00:31:22.996]  But yeah, I think everyone knew that the Clintons etc.
[00:31:24.057 --> 00:31:28.702]  had helped Media Matters initially, but he really came out and just said it.
[00:31:28.842 --> 00:31:29.903]  They just paid for it.
[00:31:30.717 --> 00:31:31.397]  Totally ridiculous.
[00:31:31.417 --> 00:31:32.517]  Hey, I want to end on this story.
[00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:33.458]  We're about to wrap up here.
[00:31:34.238 --> 00:31:42.199]  This is 2016 YouTuber Adam Saleh claims he was kicked off Delta Flight after 20 people complained he was speaking Arabic.
[00:31:42.239 --> 00:31:43.700]  And you can see there's a picture of him in here.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:49.261]  Do you think this is this fake news thing where he's putting this out to troll people about Islamophobia?
[00:31:49.401 --> 00:31:54.042]  Or do you think this is actually a real thing where he just happened to be speaking Arabic and he freaked people out?
[00:31:54.082 --> 00:31:55.562]  To me, it smells of fake news.
[00:31:56.024 --> 00:31:56.665]  Yeah, we're good.
[00:32:10.964 --> 00:32:11.844]  I'm starting in a different language.
[00:32:12.225 --> 00:32:13.545]  I speak four different languages.
[00:32:15.146 --> 00:32:30.375]  Who knows how he said it, what he said, but it seems to me the way he was getting everything on video, the way other people, as I looked at the video in the back, were like, hey, get out, who were not afraid of him, but I think were just sick and tired of him.
[00:32:30.935 --> 00:32:33.276]  I have a feeling this is very possibly some fake news.
[00:32:33.336 --> 00:32:35.998]  It certainly turned into a good hashtag, which screwed Delta.
[00:32:36.518 --> 00:32:39.760]  Adam, go ahead and plug your show real quick, your podcast, which I think is excellent, by the way.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.860]  Well, thank you very much.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.541]  It's the No Agenda Show, noagendashow.com.
[00:32:43.561 --> 00:32:50.544]  I do it with John C. Dvorak, who has been a journalist and a columnist for many, many years in Silicon Valley.
[00:32:50.924 --> 00:32:52.125]  We're in our 10th year now.
[00:32:52.845 --> 00:32:58.307]  We deconstruct media, which we've been doing for all these years, which is pretty much showing you fake news on media.
[00:32:58.407 --> 00:32:59.187]  It's nothing new.
[00:32:59.207 --> 00:33:00.248]  We've been doing it for a while.
[00:33:02.489 --> 00:33:07.270]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:14.472]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:33:14.732 --> 00:33:23.215]  I started to exercise really hard again, and I started to try to eat healthy, started taking third-party supplements, started seeing some more gains.
[00:33:23.795 --> 00:33:24.015]  I think?
[00:33:42.092 --> 00:33:45.435]  I was in the best shape of my life since I'd been in really good shape in my 20s.
[00:33:45.455 --> 00:33:46.536]  But the election heated up.
[00:33:46.576 --> 00:33:48.959]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[00:33:49.079 --> 00:33:58.348]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[00:33:58.548 --> 00:33:59.509]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[00:33:59.689 --> 00:34:03.372]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put Lazy Susan back on the table.
[00:34:04.173 --> 00:34:06.295]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again.
[00:34:07.015 --> 00:34:10.238]  And I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[00:34:10.278 --> 00:34:11.579]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:15.281]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:34:15.482 --> 00:34:16.402]  It's December 5th, 2016.
[00:34:16.522 --> 00:34:20.105]  We're only like 25 days from 2017.
[00:34:20.485 --> 00:34:30.553]  And I want to invite all of the info workers of every race, color, and creed that bleed red blood and love liberty, justice, and truth to make our bodies great again.
[00:34:33.564 --> 00:34:38.587]  One of the most common questions I get is, you've changed the whole radio TV model.
[00:34:39.348 --> 00:34:40.088]  How did you do it?
[00:34:40.148 --> 00:34:43.030]  Did an ad agency teach you that or what book did you read?
[00:34:43.351 --> 00:34:44.912]  And the answer is, it was trial and error.
[00:34:45.172 --> 00:34:50.475]  I promote products that I personally use, like the Nutraceuticals and Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:50.956 --> 00:34:52.777]  And it's the same thing for this promotion.
[00:34:53.277 --> 00:34:54.598]  I didn't get this from an ad agency.
[00:34:54.658 --> 00:34:55.859]  I didn't just think this up.
[00:34:56.339 --> 00:35:03.184]  I was sitting there, I'd gained probably 10, 15 pounds because I've gotten out of the habit of taking the supplements in the last few months with the election.
[00:35:03.964 --> 00:35:14.030]  And I was thinking, wow, I need to religiously take these, because I'm promoting these things, it's making me healthier, and if I'm not taking them, you know, I'm fatter, plus people aren't going to buy the product.
[00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.672]  So that's where the promotion comes from, is purely from reality.
[00:35:18.012 --> 00:35:24.816]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table, I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[00:35:24.856 --> 00:35:31.640]  I've lost five pounds religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:32.561]  It's amazing.
[00:35:32.861 --> 00:35:35.245]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[00:35:35.505 --> 00:35:38.229]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:35:38.429 --> 00:35:40.992]  And to be clear, I'm exercising the same amount.
[00:35:41.693 --> 00:35:45.599]  It's the holidays, so I'm eating pumpkin pie, pecan pie.
[00:35:45.799 --> 00:35:47.000]  I ate a candy bar last night.
[00:35:48.456 --> 00:35:51.598]  I mean, quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[00:35:52.018 --> 00:35:53.299]  So I'm eating worse.
[00:35:53.919 --> 00:36:01.283]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost 5 pounds.
[00:36:01.443 --> 00:36:01.983]  It's incredible.
[00:36:02.984 --> 00:36:04.905]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[00:36:05.145 --> 00:36:06.406]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[00:36:06.506 --> 00:36:08.927]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[00:36:09.527 --> 00:36:10.408]  This is an experiment.
[00:36:10.528 --> 00:36:11.268]  Everybody's watching.
[00:36:11.529 --> 00:36:12.349]  We'll see what happens.
[00:36:12.789 --> 00:36:13.930]  This is Part 2.
[00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:15.571]  Next week, Part 3.
[00:36:16.451 --> 00:36:17.052]  That's a good point.
[00:36:17.892 --> 00:36:26.998]  We just cut there and Rob Deuce said, hey Alex, I know you don't follow script, but you might want to add to people, we're running some of the biggest specials of the year until December 17th.
[00:36:27.279 --> 00:36:33.003]  That's the last day that you can get your order in and have guaranteed shipping anywhere in the United States.
[00:36:33.183 --> 00:36:34.924]  And we have some of the biggest specials of the year.
[00:36:34.944 --> 00:36:37.486]  50% off many of the nutraceuticals.
[00:36:37.806 --> 00:36:38.667]  The lowest discount is 25%.
[00:36:38.707 --> 00:36:38.847]  30% off X2.
[00:36:41.889 --> 00:36:46.991]  Huge discounts and free shipping store wide on every product, thousands of items.
[00:36:47.411 --> 00:36:51.792]  And on top of that, if you sign up for auto ship, an additional 10% off.
[00:36:51.832 --> 00:36:56.774]  And I'm going to do one more bad thing because I'm politically correct, or I guess I'm politically incorrect.
[00:36:57.234 --> 00:36:59.254]  And that's a Merry Christmas to everybody.
[00:36:59.594 --> 00:37:00.755]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:37:00.835 --> 00:37:01.375]  You're awesome.
[00:37:15.049 --> 00:37:17.010]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.871]  You're a white male!
[00:37:19.951 --> 00:37:24.393]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:37:25.233 --> 00:37:26.113]  Move, bitch!
[00:37:26.433 --> 00:37:27.334]  Get out the way!
[00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:35.354]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[00:37:35.474 --> 00:37:39.597]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:37:39.737 --> 00:37:43.280]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.641]  I will not let you down.
[00:37:44.721 --> 00:37:47.803]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:37:48.023 --> 00:37:49.484]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:37:49.544 --> 00:37:51.646]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:37:51.726 --> 00:37:57.170]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:59.432]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:37:59.933 --> 00:38:01.194]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:38:09.002 --> 00:38:13.066]  This is Joe Biggs with Infowars.com and this is a message to you, Angela Merkel.
[00:38:13.266 --> 00:38:14.027]  Do your job!
[00:38:14.087 --> 00:38:15.168]  Protect your countrymen!
[00:38:15.688 --> 00:38:16.669]  Secure your border!
[00:38:17.622 --> 00:38:20.404]  People in Europe are dying, not just Germany.
[00:38:20.764 --> 00:38:23.785]  But Francois Hollande in France is not even doing it.
[00:38:23.925 --> 00:38:26.787]  But there's a lot of new leaders getting ready to be rotated out.
[00:38:27.067 --> 00:38:28.708]  And hopefully they'll heed these words.
[00:38:29.088 --> 00:38:32.090]  Hopefully they'll watch the videos that I'm about to show.
[00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:36.232]  The clips from Charlie Hebdo, all the way up until yesterday in Berlin.
[00:38:36.692 --> 00:38:39.994]  How many innocent people have to die because of your political correctness?
[00:38:40.274 --> 00:38:44.617]  How many innocent people have to die because you refuse to secure your borders?
[00:38:45.663 --> 00:38:47.665]  It's about time you guys did your job.
[00:38:47.946 --> 00:38:49.828]  Here in America, we've done our job.
[00:38:49.868 --> 00:38:50.809]  The people have spoken.
[00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.633]  Behind every blade of grass is a Donald Trump supporter.
[00:38:54.913 --> 00:38:56.395]  That's why our country looks red.
[00:38:57.335 --> 00:38:58.835]  He will secure the border.
[00:38:59.076 --> 00:39:01.516]  He will make our military strong again.
[00:39:01.876 --> 00:39:02.197]  Why?
[00:39:02.477 --> 00:39:04.397]  Because we now have General Flynn.
[00:39:04.757 --> 00:39:07.698]  We now have General Mad Dog Mattis at the helm as well.
[00:39:08.218 --> 00:39:13.520]  These three men are going to secure our borders and secure our safety here in America.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.341]  It's about time the leaders over there in Europe
[00:39:16.781 --> 00:39:19.243]  Took a little action and followed suit.
[00:39:19.583 --> 00:39:20.264]  Welcome back to Hannity.
[00:39:20.284 --> 00:39:25.728]  At least 12 people are dead following a horrific terror attack against a satirical newspaper in Paris, France.
[00:39:26.189 --> 00:39:33.175]  The attack, carried out by heavily armed, hooded gunmen, appears to have been in reaction to that paper's depiction of the Muslim prophet Muhammad.
[00:39:37.247 --> 00:39:40.249]  These masked men have just shot a police officer.
[00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:43.952]  It's around 11.30 in the morning in central Paris.
[00:39:44.732 --> 00:39:49.416]  Journalists working in the same building as Charlie Hebdo have taken refuge on the roof.
[00:39:50.316 --> 00:39:53.559]  To the left over there someone shouts and then shots ring out.
[00:39:58.669 --> 00:39:59.690]  This is a Fox News alert.
[00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:02.951]  Right now, the hunt is on for a key suspect in the Paris terror attacks.
[00:40:03.311 --> 00:40:06.753]  The raids this morning in Belgium and France did not turn up the terrorists.
[00:40:07.193 --> 00:40:10.535]  Friday night, the world watched in horror as Paris descended into deadly chaos.
[00:40:10.995 --> 00:40:17.578]  On the record, Griff Jenkins has a look at those horrific moments that will forever be seared into the memories of the French and the world.
[00:40:18.118 --> 00:40:24.261]  I'm now on the phone with Michael D'Orio, the brother of a band member, and you were able to speak with your brother tonight.
[00:40:24.281 --> 00:40:24.861]  He's okay?
[00:40:25.702 --> 00:40:26.622]  Yeah, I was.
[00:40:26.682 --> 00:40:28.003]  He's doing fine now.
[00:40:29.568 --> 00:40:31.309]  What was he able to tell you about what happened?
[00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:38.833]  He said they were mid-set playing maybe six songs in and they heard the gunfire.
[00:40:46.597 --> 00:40:53.580]  They heard the gunfire and said it was louder than, you know, what they were even playing so they, you know, by the time they
[00:40:55.556 --> 00:41:03.041]  The first explosion occurred at 8 a.m., the heart of the morning rush hour at Brussels Zeventem Airport.
[00:41:03.481 --> 00:41:07.624]  Witnesses described the ceiling caving in and blood all over the departure hall.
[00:41:08.184 --> 00:41:15.849]  About 10 minutes later, a second blast, louder than the first, bringing down ceilings and rupturing pipes, water mixing with blood from the victims.
[00:41:16.175 --> 00:41:23.763]  An ex-convict killed a senior police captain and his partner in a suburb of Paris late Monday in what French authorities called an act of terrorism.
[00:41:24.023 --> 00:41:29.149]  Islamic State's news agency cited an unnamed source as saying that an ISIS fighter carried out the attack.
[00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:36.797]  Islamic State recently appealed for Western followers to launch attacks at home during the holy month of Ramadan, which started last week.
[00:41:37.257 --> 00:41:52.650]  In 2014, ISIS spokesperson, Adnani, not only encouraged their followers in ISIS to get into vehicles and to mow people down on the streets, he specifically said, especially in France, there are a number of reasons jihadists are angry with France.
[00:41:53.251 --> 00:42:02.399]  One of them, among many others, as we know, is the tragic attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices and their stance on free speech was a laudable, praiseworthy stance.
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.381]  And the second is the ban on face veils.
[00:42:05.421 --> 00:42:13.827]  The jihadists have taken it upon themselves to attack France as a symbolic gesture that symbolizes a general attack on the West.
[00:42:14.168 --> 00:42:17.430]  Well, Veronica, witnesses say they had no warning.
[00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:20.132]  The White House has condemned this as an act of terror.
[00:42:20.172 --> 00:42:24.936]  And just 45 minutes ago, German police came out and said the attack was on purpose.
[00:42:26.144 --> 00:42:32.266]  This battered windshield gives us a look at the damage after an 18-wheeler turned into a deadly weapon.
[00:42:32.707 --> 00:42:38.249]  Witnesses say the truck jumped the curb straight into Berlin's Christmas market, packed full of people.
[00:42:38.689 --> 00:42:53.515]  We heard a loud bang, and we started to see to our left that Christmas lights were being torn down, and then we started to see the top of an articulated truck, a lorry, just crashing through the stalls and through people.
[00:42:53.775 --> 00:42:55.696]  Literally, the truck was 20 feet away from me.
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.685]  How many times does this have to happen before people say enough is enough?
[00:43:06.957 --> 00:43:15.883]  Quite frankly, I'm getting sick and tired of turning on the TV and hearing about another attack in Europe, when all you have to do is secure the borders.
[00:43:16.444 --> 00:43:20.227]  But people like Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel could care less.
[00:43:20.907 --> 00:43:26.151]  They sit by and they praise the same people who'd rather see you at the end of their blade.
[00:43:26.451 --> 00:43:32.876]  The same people who'd rather steal a semi-truck and drive over you while you're hanging out with your family.
[00:43:33.416 --> 00:43:34.437]  This isn't an accident.
[00:43:34.457 --> 00:43:37.720]  This is all done by design, by the globalists.
[00:43:38.281 --> 00:43:45.949]  Leave the borders wide open, usher in the radical jihadis, and have the people beg for more government, more security.
[00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:50.433]  At the end of the day, all you have to do is give up your freedoms.
[00:43:51.034 --> 00:43:53.036]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:43:59.599 --> 00:44:01.140]  Well, how's this for a New Year's resolution?
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.822]  Don't get sexually assaulted this year if you're walking the streets.
[00:44:04.202 --> 00:44:04.762]  And you know what?
[00:44:04.862 --> 00:44:07.824]  That's a pretty good one considering what happened in Germany last year.
[00:44:08.184 --> 00:44:13.728]  1,200 women just out and about celebrating New Year's Eve at festivals and other places outside of metros.
[00:44:14.108 --> 00:44:18.090]  They were sexually assaulted en masse in Cologne, Hamburg, and other cities.
[00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:20.872]  And do you remember this article from the Washington Post?
[00:44:21.012 --> 00:44:22.573]  I ripped this off from the summer.
[00:44:22.953 --> 00:44:40.196]  That finally acknowledged that 1,200 women, German women, were sexually assaulted because officials were so tight-lipped they didn't want to acknowledge the fact that they have this massive migrant crisis and oh by the way they're not following the norms of society and they're sexually assaulting our women because they're not covered up and i.e.
[00:44:40.236 --> 00:44:41.017]  not respectable.
[00:44:41.397 --> 00:44:53.180]  Now, we saw a HuffPost writer, 18-year-old Syrian refugee, talk about the sex assault of women, and he basically said, and I'm paraphrasing here, that women deserve it because they're not respected, because they're not covered up.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:45:01.842]  So, it looks like officials, they have a solution to this this year, so if you live in Germany and Sweden and other places where sex assault at the hands of migrants is very common now,
[00:45:02.222 --> 00:45:03.722]  Well, it looks like they have a solution.
[00:45:03.782 --> 00:45:06.003]  So, first there was the rape bracelet.
[00:45:06.103 --> 00:45:07.783]  Do not rape me, if you remember that.
[00:45:07.923 --> 00:45:08.604]  What a success.
[00:45:08.724 --> 00:45:14.945]  Now it looks like, in this article aggregating from RT News, women in Vienna are going to get an anti-rape pocket alarm.
[00:45:15.325 --> 00:45:16.445]  Oh, that's going to be helpful.
[00:45:16.906 --> 00:45:30.669]  Primarily aimed at this New Year's Eve campaign to stop them from getting sex assaulted, sexually assaulted, en masse again, because we just can't have another crisis like that where 1,200 women are reported being fondled, grabbed, sexually assaulted en masse.
[00:45:31.169 --> 00:45:33.591]  We can't have that again because we might have to acknowledge it this time.
[00:45:33.671 --> 00:45:35.333]  So we're going to give you this alarm.
[00:45:35.393 --> 00:45:42.239]  Now, these Austrian police, they're going to distribute these pocket alarms to women on New Year's Eve in order to prevent one thing.
[00:45:42.279 --> 00:45:43.440]  That's, of course, sex assault.
[00:45:44.001 --> 00:45:49.686]  And these gadgets, they're going to emit this shrill alarm because that's really going to stop an attacker.
[00:45:50.566 --> 00:45:53.889]  In the event that women are approached by an offender.
[00:45:53.929 --> 00:45:55.470]  Now, this is a national campaign.
[00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:56.931]  It's aimed at women on New Year's Eve.
[00:45:57.272 --> 00:46:00.154]  The Interior Ministry, they talked about this yesterday.
[00:46:00.174 --> 00:46:02.676]  6,000 pocket alarms in all.
[00:46:03.216 --> 00:46:09.621]  And women, we know, because they're not covered, we see this mass clash of civilizations underway.
[00:46:10.042 --> 00:46:14.665]  Where in places like Western Europe, you've got this mass migrant population coming in.
[00:46:15.126 --> 00:46:19.089]  And we're seeing sex assaults and rapes like we have never seen before.
[00:46:19.509 --> 00:46:25.573]  And the only thing making it worse is that officials aren't even willing to acknowledge that it's happening to their own people.
[00:46:25.973 --> 00:46:27.994]  Now, we talked about this on InfoWars this morning.
[00:46:28.034 --> 00:46:36.960]  The EU, in response to the terrorist attack that happened in Berlin, where that lorry, that lorry, that unmanned lorry, if you remember, ran over 12 people.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:37.940]  That was the original.
[00:46:38.601 --> 00:46:44.244]  It looks like they're willing to acknowledge these crimes now, and here's how they're going to combat it with a shrill sound.
[00:46:44.324 --> 00:46:45.465]  What else is going to stop it?
[00:46:45.925 --> 00:46:48.026]  I'm Margaret Hale, reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:47:03.024 --> 00:47:11.171]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:20.958]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.379 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.302 --> 00:47:28.304]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.324 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.
[00:47:53.493 --> 00:47:54.533]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.

[00:48:59.626 --> 00:49:02.287]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:08.325 --> 00:49:13.587]  Jordan Maxwell of JordanMaxwellShow.com joining us as we get ready to finish up 2016.
[00:49:14.327 --> 00:49:16.088]  This whole country is under attack.
[00:49:16.628 --> 00:49:18.209]  And the reason why is very simple.
[00:49:18.249 --> 00:49:21.950]  If you don't take down the biggest guy on the block, then you don't have anything yet.
[00:49:22.291 --> 00:49:35.456]  All communist countries officially are referred to as democratic republics, like the North Korean Democratic Republic of North Korea, the Democratic Republic of Cuba, the Democratic Republic of China.
[00:49:35.676 --> 00:49:37.797]  It's always a democratic republic.
[00:49:41.159 --> 00:49:43.460]  Exactly.
[00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:52.425]  We need to understand that when you use the word democratic today, we're talking about corporate democracy, which is actually today called communism.
[00:49:52.485 --> 00:49:52.905]  No, not at all.
[00:50:04.232 --> 00:50:24.210]  Precisely, and that's exactly why today the communist movement throughout the world is absolutely elated when Obama was made president because finally, they finally got a full-blown Marxist-Leninist Soviet communist old-school Soviet communist
[00:50:25.031 --> 00:50:25.931]  We're good to go.
[00:50:48.496 --> 00:50:51.557]  Of course, all the communists call their countries democratic.
[00:50:51.897 --> 00:50:59.681]  That's a word cooked up by the Democratic Party, which were the Jacobin side of the whole Illuminati, and it's all right there in history, but no one knows, so break it down.
[00:50:59.701 --> 00:51:05.223]  What's really important here is the word peace, because the communists have always used the word peace.
[00:51:05.903 --> 00:51:19.749]  What they're talking about, if you look in their journals and read their books and read the Marxist-Leninist philosophy, peace to them means a cessation of againstness, meaning the stopping of being against something.
[00:51:20.329 --> 00:51:23.410]  So when you stop being against something, then we have peace.
[00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:25.571]  That's what it means to them.
[00:51:25.751 --> 00:51:27.311]  It doesn't mean peace for the world.
[00:51:27.332 --> 00:51:28.092]  It means submission.
[00:51:28.792 --> 00:51:29.994]  That means submission.
[00:51:30.134 --> 00:51:35.099]  So when you're being raped, if you're fighting, if you've got a gun, that's dangerous.
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:39.544]  If someone's going to be raped and they're carrying a gun, that could be dangerous.
[00:51:40.165 --> 00:51:45.231]  Or if they're fighting you and yelling and screaming, then they're fighting the raping.
[00:51:45.471 --> 00:51:46.612]  But if you give up,
[00:51:47.386 --> 00:51:50.209]  Then that's peace, because nobody's going to fight anymore.
[00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:55.113]  So that's what Marxist-Leninism in their very publications say.
[00:51:55.213 --> 00:52:02.700]  That's what peace means, to give up and accept Marxist-Leninist communism and the concentration camps.
[00:52:02.881 --> 00:52:05.803]  If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.
[00:52:06.064 --> 00:52:11.369]  So therefore, the idea is that the people who willingly go along with you
[00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:17.395]  Tells the dictator that these people are so stupid, they don't even know what I'm doing.
[00:52:17.556 --> 00:52:19.278]  And that's incredible they're so stupid.
[00:52:19.298 --> 00:52:26.025]  So as long as the people are kept ignorant and ill-informed and can't read and can't think, you know, I mean...
[00:52:27.467 --> 00:52:32.010]  Universities and schools teach you what to think, but they don't teach you how to think.
[00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:38.655]  It's like Albert Einstein being taught mathematics by somebody from a mental institution.
[00:52:39.295 --> 00:52:44.699]  When you're sitting and watching television, people who you know are crooked.
[00:52:44.759 --> 00:52:48.382]  I made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago.
[00:52:49.218 --> 00:52:50.159]  They are racist.
[00:52:50.459 --> 00:52:51.500]  We haven't talked about race.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.081]  This was a white lash.
[00:52:53.882 --> 00:52:55.463]  They are mentally deranged.
[00:52:55.523 --> 00:53:02.088]  Pierce, challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally, and pop him.
[00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:03.029]  I'd love to see that.
[00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:04.430]  In uniform.
[00:53:05.711 --> 00:53:08.233]  But they're trying to explain to you what's going on.
[00:53:08.373 --> 00:53:17.441]  If you were a normal, everyday, average, intelligent person, and you take a vacation, and you go to a city where there's a huge mental asylum,
[00:53:18.481 --> 00:53:24.244]  And for the first time, you thought you would go visit this mental hospital just to see how things work.
[00:53:24.685 --> 00:53:32.449]  And you're walking through while everybody in the place is there because they're mentally deranged and they're mentally crippled, whatever.
[00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:36.211]  And so, but they are arguing with each other.
[00:53:36.271 --> 00:53:38.512]  They're ranting and raving, arguing with each other.
[00:53:38.552 --> 00:53:40.133]  But they're used to each other.
[00:53:40.173 --> 00:53:41.413]  They're used to doing that.
[00:53:41.854 --> 00:53:42.974]  So it's fine with them.
[00:53:43.054 --> 00:53:44.235]  But when you come in,
[00:53:44.935 --> 00:53:50.657]  They don't like you at all, because you don't talk like them, you don't look like them, and nobody knows who you are.
[00:53:51.098 --> 00:53:54.159]  No man is safe when freedom fails.
[00:53:54.899 --> 00:54:02.482]  The best men rot in filthy jails, while those who cried, appease, appease, are hung by those they tried to please.
[00:54:05.632 --> 00:54:10.893]  We are 29 days away from a Trump presidency and we're scratching our heads around here at InfoWars.
[00:54:11.033 --> 00:54:13.174]  What is, what is no one doing over here?
[00:54:13.254 --> 00:54:19.095]  We are, we're actually pondering today what Barack Obama is doing his last 29 days in office.
[00:54:19.155 --> 00:54:19.976]  You wouldn't believe it.
[00:54:20.076 --> 00:54:21.196]  Of course, he's on vacation.
[00:54:21.216 --> 00:54:22.736]  He's on day five of this vacation.
[00:54:23.176 --> 00:54:24.997]  I'm joined in studio by Owen Schroyer.
[00:54:25.017 --> 00:54:26.097]  We're going to be discussing this.
[00:54:26.437 --> 00:54:27.818]  So we've got vacation going on.
[00:54:27.858 --> 00:54:29.678]  We've got midnight regulations going on.
[00:54:30.218 --> 00:54:30.599]  I think so.
[00:54:45.375 --> 00:54:58.286]  Well, this was one that I really wanted to go after Obama on with the executive orders, but when it comes down to it, to be honest, Barack Obama is kind of, maybe not middle of the road, but he didn't pass the most executive orders of all time.
[00:54:58.326 --> 00:55:00.869]  Even George W. Bush passed more than his.
[00:55:01.169 --> 00:55:09.076]  However, if you look at the Espionage Act, the executive orders, and other activity that comes just from his desk,
[00:55:10.016 --> 00:55:15.980]  All of it combined, Obama certainly has no room to talk as far as telling Donald Trump what to do.
[00:55:29.429 --> 00:55:36.376]  More than 350,000 pages worth of paperwork and, you know, these are a bunch of rules, Owen, we frankly don't need.
[00:55:36.396 --> 00:55:43.483]  And he's giving President Trump, President-Elect Trump, his works cut out for him, undoing some of these.
[00:55:43.543 --> 00:55:44.885]  I mean, they're disastrous.
[00:55:45.185 --> 00:55:46.526]  Oh, and he's also at the gym today.
[00:55:47.227 --> 00:55:51.269]  Well, he's got to work on his golf game too, so he's playing plenty of golf.
[00:55:51.289 --> 00:55:51.809]  But you know what?
[00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:52.229]  That's fine.
[00:55:52.249 --> 00:55:53.350]  He's got a month left in office.
[00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:54.731]  Things are so bad.
[00:55:54.811 --> 00:55:56.111]  Russia's influencing our election.
[00:55:56.151 --> 00:55:57.992]  It's a big deal, but he's got to go take a vacation.
[00:55:58.072 --> 00:55:58.252]  Hey!
[00:55:58.372 --> 00:55:59.953]  No, but this is the stuff he's doing.
[00:56:00.273 --> 00:56:02.234]  You just mentioned a few of them.
[00:56:02.274 --> 00:56:02.814]  Here's another one.
[00:56:02.914 --> 00:56:08.177]  Obama hands out a $2 billion loan to further his global warming goals.
[00:56:08.197 --> 00:56:12.559]  The Obama administration will give $2 billion in loan guarantees to a first-of-a-kind project
[00:56:12.879 --> 00:56:13.359]  We're good to go.
[00:56:40.273 --> 00:56:50.857]  These goals, these agendas that the establishment had, that Hillary Clinton certainly would have come on in similar fashion with a pen, forced some of these things into the fold, well that's not possible anymore.
[00:56:50.897 --> 00:56:52.958]  So what he's got to do is he's got to sign them all.
[00:56:52.998 --> 00:56:56.099]  He's got to sign 110,000 refugees coming here this year.
[00:56:56.399 --> 00:56:57.940]  He's got to sign all these billions away.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:04.343]  So we know that at the last lug of this, he promised to take 110,000 Syrian refugees in the fiscal year 2016.
[00:57:04.663 --> 00:57:06.564]  He has gone above this.
[00:57:07.064 --> 00:57:08.485]  He's gone 585 over his 110,000 pledge.
[00:57:08.945 --> 00:57:10.826]  That's just so far.
[00:57:10.926 --> 00:57:14.968]  We've got places like Fargo, North Dakota, who are saying, we refuse to take any.
[00:57:14.988 --> 00:57:15.888]  We're not doing it.
[00:57:16.649 --> 00:57:19.290]  And you've got towns where he's trying to shuffle people
[00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:27.253]  As quickly as he can, get them into small towns across America and he's doing this in these cities and they're now fighting back.
[00:57:27.633 --> 00:57:31.995]  But the last leg of this, nearly 14,000, he's pushing them right on through.
[00:57:32.015 --> 00:57:33.515]  He is ahead of schedule.
[00:57:33.535 --> 00:57:37.317]  He promised he was going to do it and he's over the amount that we're supposed to take.
[00:57:37.571 --> 00:57:38.951]  Well, and let's look at the other side of this.
[00:57:38.971 --> 00:57:41.852]  So we know what Obama is doing in his last days in office.
[00:57:42.452 --> 00:57:50.115]  Well, vacationing, but also trying to use the pen to force some of these agendas into the fold so that Trump has to deal with them when he becomes president.
[00:57:50.135 --> 00:57:54.796]  But look, the Boeing CEO has now assured Trump that Air Force One will be affordable.
[00:57:55.176 --> 00:58:02.078]  Donald Trump is already more presidential and having a more positive impact on America
[00:58:02.458 --> 00:58:05.280]  Then Barack Obama ever had in eight years in office.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:13.404]  Trump hasn't even stepped in the White House yet and he's already being a more positive impact for America than Barack Obama ever has.
[00:58:13.724 --> 00:58:19.727]  And these are the types of negotiations, this is the type of skill, this is the type of power that Donald Trump brings to the White House.
[00:58:20.008 --> 00:58:24.610]  A man who's not just going to have an open wallet for anybody who wants to take this contract, no-bid contract.
[00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:26.771]  He says, hey look, we're going to get a fair deal.
[00:58:27.051 --> 00:58:29.132]  We're going to come in under budget, ahead of schedule.
[00:58:29.152 --> 00:58:30.713]  We're going to get the best deal for the American people.
[00:58:30.953 --> 00:58:31.734]  We're already seeing it.
[00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:35.453]  Can you imagine turning down a presidential jet because it costs too much money?
[00:58:35.473 --> 00:58:36.814]  You know, making those kinds of decisions.
[00:58:37.134 --> 00:58:39.896]  I was so proud to report that when it was happening, and you're absolutely right.
[00:58:40.236 --> 00:58:46.861]  He is much more presidential, even prior to taking office, than we've seen Barack Obama be in eight years.
[00:58:46.901 --> 00:58:49.023]  The question is, can he undo these rags?
[00:58:49.383 --> 00:58:50.104]  Let's just hope so.
[00:58:50.144 --> 00:58:52.265]  In his first 100 days, that's going to do it for us.
[00:58:52.325 --> 00:58:53.366]  We are out of time.
[00:58:53.807 --> 00:58:56.889]  Be sure to tune in to the Nightly News tomorrow night, 7 p.m.
[00:58:56.929 --> 00:58:57.309]  Central.
[00:58:57.369 --> 00:58:58.330]  We're going to be here.
[00:58:58.750 --> 00:58:59.291]  We'll see you then.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.932]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.393 --> 00:59:20.121]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.442 --> 00:59:24.185]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.746 --> 00:59:27.588]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:36.017]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.317 --> 00:59:38.620]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.261 --> 00:59:41.723]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
