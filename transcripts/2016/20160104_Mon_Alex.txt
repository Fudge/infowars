[00:00:01.657 --> 00:00:04.246]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:19.490]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:20.952]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.635]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:26.879]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.524]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.898 --> 00:00:38.941]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, January the 4th, 2016.
[00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:46.546]  It's the new year and we have a lot of new news, a lot of problems that have developed over the weekend.
[00:00:46.586 --> 00:00:58.293]  And of course, we have been following, if you listened to the program yesterday, you heard us talking about the recent changes in Oregon with the Bundy brothers and the militia that are out there.
[00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:01.816]  They went out there to support a family which basically did not want their support.
[00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:03.217]  And so we're going to be talking about
[00:01:03.877 --> 00:01:07.180]  How that has escalated and changed, we have sent our crew out there.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.421]  Joe Biggs will be reporting.
[00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:16.369]  They're on their way to the site, the federal facility that has been taken over by the people who were there to protest initially.
[00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.316]  And we're going to take a look at how this is being used by the mainstream media, but we need to be on the ground here at this point.
[00:01:24.336 --> 00:01:26.639]  I looked at this story, as I mentioned yesterday,
[00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.500]  As it started to develop back in October, they had the ruling.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.362]  Then in November, the Bundys got on this and were very concerned about what's going on.
[00:01:34.382 --> 00:01:35.502]  We're going to give you some of the details.
[00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:37.923]  You should be concerned at what happened to this family.
[00:01:38.603 --> 00:01:43.685]  And if this type of thing had happened to me, I would want some protection and I would fight this.
[00:01:43.725 --> 00:01:44.906]  But that's not their decision.
[00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:47.087]  And we have to respect their decision.
[00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:50.249]  And so I didn't really see anything to cover there.
[00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:58.633]  Because you had people that wanted to go there, they went there, they tried to educate the people in the community to get them to stand around these people.
[00:01:58.653 --> 00:02:03.616]  But at the core, they just wanted to quietly go back and serve additional jail time.
[00:02:04.813 --> 00:02:05.954]  That's the fundamental issue.
[00:02:06.655 --> 00:02:18.006]  However, after the protests went and after it looked like the local community, as well as the Hammonds who are going back to jail, looked like they did not want to protest any of this, they're afraid of the government.
[00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:19.307]  They work with the government.
[00:02:19.447 --> 00:02:23.311]  Over half of the community works for the government, the federal government.
[00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:26.955]  And of course, the government owns over half of the land in Oregon.
[00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:30.058]  It looks a lot like an Indian reservation, doesn't it?
[00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.239]  Where the government owns everything, everybody is obliged to the government.
[00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.460]  Of course, you know, those are just the people with jobs, half of them that work for the government.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.801]  The other people who don't have jobs are living off of the government.
[00:02:40.421 --> 00:02:43.861]  That is what they have done to the Indians in the past.
[00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:50.583]  When we talked about what happened at Wounded Knee, we talked about the similarities and the tactics of how the government has treated us.
[00:02:50.623 --> 00:02:53.603]  And, of course, now it looks like we're going to have a Wounded Knee Part 3.
[00:02:54.464 --> 00:02:55.724]  Don't know how that's going to turn out.
[00:02:57.085 --> 00:02:58.426]  I understand the frustration.
[00:02:58.446 --> 00:03:08.835]  I don't think that this is a good time to do this, of course, because today we have Obama starting to talk about his executive orders for gun control.
[00:03:08.915 --> 00:03:20.785]  He's going to be given an hour on CNN to push for this, and don't you know that he's going to be focusing on this, saying this is a prime example of why citizens can't be trusted with guns.
[00:03:20.865 --> 00:03:22.046]  We're also going to be talking about
[00:03:22.746 --> 00:03:24.827]  A lot of different news.
[00:03:24.847 --> 00:03:31.508]  We've got information about what happened in Turkey as well as in Saudi Arabia over the weekend.
[00:03:32.448 --> 00:03:37.910]  We had in Saudi Arabia 47 people executed right after the beginning of the new year.
[00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.191]  I know they were waiting so they didn't set a new Guinness Book of Records for the number of people beheaded in a given year.
[00:03:44.071 --> 00:03:49.937]  And of course, these are people that were labeled terrorists, just like these ranchers were labeled terrorists by the BLM.
[00:03:49.977 --> 00:03:51.038]  That's a favorite label.
[00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.321]  Let's go to Alex Jones right now.
[00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:54.001]  He's calling in.
[00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:54.782]  He's on the road.
[00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:55.743]  Alex, go ahead.
[00:03:55.763 --> 00:03:57.625]  That's right, David.
[00:03:57.645 --> 00:04:01.589]  I just filed a very powerful 10-minute report that is being uploaded to you.
[00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:03.852]  I just finished it minutes ago, a little bit late.
[00:04:04.705 --> 00:04:07.287]  Uh, that will break down basically everything we're starting to get into.
[00:04:07.327 --> 00:04:08.928]  This is a very important time.
[00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:11.429]  This is the main push to get our guns.
[00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:22.876]  And folks, with this new situation out in Oregon, we do not want to do any favors for Obama that gives him the background to come after the guns and legitimize what he's doing.
[00:04:23.216 --> 00:04:24.877]  And he's doing this with executive power.
[00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:33.842]  This is really about the executive power grab, so that in a few months, the word is, they're going to have even more draconian executive actions on guns.
[00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:44.855]  So this is the opening sound vote, and I break down the fact that absolutely the feds are stealing land, absolutely they're out of control, absolutely they're Wallace, absolutely under the Declaration of Independence.
[00:04:45.415 --> 00:04:47.116]  You should be able to, you know, stand up to this.
[00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:50.579]  I get what these people are doing, but you have a wide open building.
[00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:59.462]  With saying, come from all over the country no matter who you are, guaranteed provocateurs are showing up and other things are happening.
[00:04:59.502 --> 00:05:04.684]  The whole Soros group is saying, here are our white terrorists, here are our cowboy hat-wearing terrorists.
[00:05:05.024 --> 00:05:08.665]  It gives them the backdrop saying, they want to start a civil war.
[00:05:09.145 --> 00:05:18.709]  At least 20 armed militia members, including three members of the Bundy family, have seized control of a federal building at the Milor National Wildlife Refuge about 50 miles southeast of Burns, Oregon.
[00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.251]  The occupation is in response to the persecution of two Oregon ranchers, Dwight Hammond Jr.
[00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:27.493]  and Stephen Hammond, who were convicted of a federal arson charge under an anti-terrorism law.
[00:05:27.753 --> 00:05:33.196]  In 2006, the Hammonds started a controlled burn to stop the spread of a lightning storm fire, which threatened their ranch.
[00:05:33.396 --> 00:05:43.543]  The backfire saved their home and much of their property, but five years later the federal government, particularly the Bureau of Land Management, claimed the Hammonds were terrorists who started the fire to damage federally controlled land.
[00:05:43.703 --> 00:05:49.707]  The feds sent Dwight and Stephen to prison and are threatening to take their 12,000 acre property if they do not pay the BLM $200,000.
[00:05:51.428 --> 00:05:55.590]  InfoWars reporter Joe Biggs and other crew members will be on the scene giving live updates.
[00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:02.234]  You can also follow Alex Jones on Facebook and the Alex Jones channel on YouTube for the latest developments on the situation.
[00:06:02.554 --> 00:06:08.357]  And check back on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv for more news and this is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:06:09.117 --> 00:06:12.839]  Secret 12, InfoWars Life's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:19.221]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:26.384]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:06:26.684 --> 00:06:35.514]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:06:35.794 --> 00:06:41.741]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:06:41.981 --> 00:06:45.125]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections and
[00:06:45.445 --> 00:06:46.706]  Adenosylcobalamin.
[00:06:46.786 --> 00:06:50.129]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:51.991]  No needles, no injections.
[00:06:52.271 --> 00:06:53.772]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:06:53.912 --> 00:06:54.953]  Try it for yourself.
[00:06:55.113 --> 00:06:56.134]  Discover the secret.
[00:06:56.354 --> 00:06:56.695]  Secret 12.

[00:07:18.695 --> 00:07:23.279]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.

[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.240]  I think?
[00:07:44.747 --> 00:07:49.730]  As verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.

[00:07:55.133 --> 00:08:00.756]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.

[00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.552]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:24.133 --> 00:08:28.336]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:42.646]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen, as we broadcast worldwide on this Monday, the first weekday show of 2016.
[00:08:42.906 --> 00:08:46.969]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:47.149 --> 00:08:49.191]  I am in Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:08:50.086 --> 00:09:07.841]  And I'm going to start conducting an interview in about an hour with a very, very important individual, especially when it comes to stopping any type of civil insurrection or George Soros plan, the Black Lives Matter issues in this country.
[00:09:07.901 --> 00:09:16.027]  I'm working around the clock trying to stop the globalists from foiling the political process in this country and our attempts to basically save this republic.
[00:09:16.508 --> 00:09:17.829]  And so are a lot of other people.
[00:09:18.743 --> 00:09:25.046]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I filed an 11-minute report that will be premiering here.
[00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:27.407]  I just finished it about 15 minutes ago.
[00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:29.748]  David Knight is going to be hosting the first three hours.
[00:09:30.988 --> 00:09:36.090]  And Paul Joseph Watson will be joining us from London, England in the fourth hour.
[00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:40.172]  Obviously, the stock market is plunging right now as we go into the new year.
[00:09:40.572 --> 00:09:44.454]  Obviously, huge big developments in the Middle East that David Knight is going to be covering.
[00:09:44.494 --> 00:09:47.175]  But remember, I've been totally warning
[00:09:48.030 --> 00:10:00.478]  And so is the rest of my research crew, that obviously the big foundations, the big organizations are funding the racist movement, Black Lives Matter, that is meant to divide and conquer the country.
[00:10:00.518 --> 00:10:12.986]  Obviously there's major police problems as well, but as discredited as this group is, it just legitimizes all that and allows the globalist federalization of the police as a response to it via these quote, strong cities,
[00:10:14.382 --> 00:10:15.163]  UN initiative.
[00:10:15.183 --> 00:10:20.928]  They have been trying to provocateur and infiltrate patriotic militia groups and others forever.
[00:10:21.449 --> 00:10:38.904]  And whenever I would learn that a militia group was infiltrated, I'd talk about it 15, 16, 17 years ago, and I would get demonized by the usual suspects, but it turned out were federal informants or were actually federal agents or were CIA national security agents like Hal Turner, who was their own guy, but they still burned him.
[00:10:39.617 --> 00:10:46.421]  I've been doing this for a long time, and they always stand up and say, there's no provocateurs, there's no feds anywhere that try to stir stuff up.
[00:10:46.721 --> 00:10:47.621]  That doesn't exist.
[00:10:47.742 --> 00:10:48.682]  Alex is a fed.
[00:10:48.762 --> 00:10:49.663]  Alex is a fed.
[00:10:50.103 --> 00:10:51.023]  This is what they do.
[00:10:52.064 --> 00:10:59.508]  Now, I believe the Bundys are good, well-meaning, strong people overall, and the feds are stealing property everywhere.
[00:10:59.528 --> 00:11:01.329]  It is part of the UN agenda 21.
[00:11:01.709 --> 00:11:02.470]  It is wrong.
[00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.250]  It is evil.
[00:11:04.056 --> 00:11:06.077]  Okay, so I understand what's happening.
[00:11:06.337 --> 00:11:06.997]  They're peaceful.
[00:11:07.337 --> 00:11:08.318]  It's an empty building.
[00:11:09.558 --> 00:11:21.062]  It's to create a stand, you know, like the Alamo, peaceably, hopefully, where people point out what's happening is wrong, and then they think if they get killed there, it'll be like the Alamo, and that'll set off the whole thing that'll save the country.
[00:11:21.442 --> 00:11:27.204]  Folks, the globalists want a physical fight because they think they can win that easier than an information war.
[00:11:27.524 --> 00:11:29.185]  We'll win a physical fight long term.
[00:11:29.225 --> 00:11:31.786]  I've looked at the history of it, looked at all the angles.
[00:11:32.597 --> 00:11:33.998]  But we don't want to go that direction.
[00:11:34.258 --> 00:11:35.898]  We are going to win the info war.
[00:11:35.978 --> 00:11:41.441]  And then if they want to start a war or false flag and try to blame it on us and come arrest patriots, then it kicks off.
[00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:43.241]  But we are not offensive.
[00:11:43.341 --> 00:11:44.782]  We are defensive.
[00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.683]  And I understand they're taking land and doing all this.
[00:11:48.204 --> 00:11:52.325]  The problem is the Hammonds have said they don't want the Bundy people there.
[00:11:52.905 --> 00:11:54.046]  Now let's get past all that.
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:12:01.881]  This is not, this is not the grazing rights like we had a few years ago, where the family's been there since 1878, 1877.
[00:12:02.841 --> 00:12:03.561]  100% grazing rights.
[00:12:03.902 --> 00:12:07.322]  The feds come in, kick 34 other families off.
[00:12:07.362 --> 00:12:08.562]  They're the last family standing.
[00:12:08.822 --> 00:12:09.823]  They were totally on the right.
[00:12:09.883 --> 00:12:16.564]  David Knight was there with Josh Owens, literally, while the feds were saying, we're going to shoot you, we're going to shoot you, if you cross the line.
[00:12:16.864 --> 00:12:20.084]  And they bravely, like combat reporters, got that footage.
[00:12:20.104 --> 00:12:23.705]  We should re-air that historic footage today, that historic report.
[00:12:24.614 --> 00:12:27.477]  I'd have David narrate the parts that aren't good for radio today.
[00:12:27.517 --> 00:12:28.638]  That is so important.
[00:12:29.218 --> 00:12:30.139]  Would that be re-seen?
[00:12:30.419 --> 00:12:30.939]  They were there.
[00:12:30.979 --> 00:12:31.820]  They were on horseback.
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.522]  They weren't aiming their guns at the feds.
[00:12:33.822 --> 00:12:35.383]  The feds were aiming their guns at them.
[00:12:35.683 --> 00:12:37.064]  They were absolutely in the right.
[00:12:37.105 --> 00:12:38.466]  It was the real John Wayne.
[00:12:38.686 --> 00:12:40.267]  It's what John Wayne wishes he was.
[00:12:40.728 --> 00:12:41.929]  This was true Americana.
[00:12:42.289 --> 00:12:43.530]  So I admire these folks.
[00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:49.575]  But at the same time, you don't just mindlessly then support the next operation without saying, my First Amendment right.
[00:12:50.754 --> 00:12:53.195]  Hey, this is the day Obama launches the gun grab.
[00:12:53.275 --> 00:12:58.276]  Hey, this is what they keep telling the local police and sheriff's departments is going to happen and why they're giving them armored vehicles.
[00:12:58.716 --> 00:13:00.837]  Hey, we should think for ourselves here.
[00:13:01.137 --> 00:13:02.518]  Hey, is this the best timing?
[00:13:02.698 --> 00:13:04.038]  Because you're not wanted by the local.
[00:13:05.178 --> 00:13:11.540]  And you've seen in Oregon, sheriffs saying, get ready for the war with the Patriots the last few years and all this provocateuring.
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.101]  I'm telling you, folks, I'm telling you.
[00:13:15.228 --> 00:13:19.432]  There's agitation going on, 110%, just like with the Black Lives Matter.
[00:13:19.652 --> 00:13:24.816]  And notice Black Lives Matter went into action yesterday, saying, this is white terror, time to take the guns.
[00:13:25.196 --> 00:13:26.217]  The militias are coming.
[00:13:26.537 --> 00:13:27.758]  We want the National Guard.
[00:13:27.818 --> 00:13:28.639]  We want war.
[00:13:28.699 --> 00:13:29.640]  We want this to happen.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:42.110]  This is to change the subject from Obama offensively coming to get our guns and trying to blame San Bernardino on patriots, to then flip it and say, see, there's an armed takeover of a federal building right now.
[00:13:42.891 --> 00:13:44.072]  We got to do something.
[00:13:44.941 --> 00:13:55.884]  So, I'm telling you, the timing is out of control, and I understand there's been demonstrations going on there for years, and then magically, this happened at this point.
[00:13:56.264 --> 00:14:00.825]  I mean, folks, Papa didn't, Mama didn't raise a fool, and I don't think the Bundys are bad.
[00:14:00.865 --> 00:14:02.486]  I don't think most of the militia people are bad.
[00:14:02.966 --> 00:14:13.329]  I don't think any of these folks are bad, except for some of the things that are being said and pushed that overall basically gets this situation out of control.
[00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:14.840]  Out of control.
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:29.016]  And those of us that are seeking to try to fix this peacefully know that in 1995, a whole bunch of state houses were moving in 94 and 95 to get us out of the UN, to take the private property back, to abolish the BLM, to kick them off land.
[00:14:29.396 --> 00:14:30.698]  We had 20 plus states.
[00:14:31.479 --> 00:14:32.320]  Patriots, remember this.
[00:14:33.416 --> 00:14:39.997]  We had 20 plus states that had voted to basically control the federal government and stop the UN takeover, and then Oklahoma City happened.
[00:14:40.438 --> 00:14:44.638]  We've got multiple governors like Greg Abbott coming out over the weekend saying, come and take it.
[00:14:44.879 --> 00:14:46.899]  The state will stand against you trying to take guns.
[00:14:47.179 --> 00:14:49.680]  We've got sheriffs and police chiefs standing and saying the right thing.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.780]  We've got police departments saying the right thing.
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.480]  We've got good stuff in Congress.
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:59.382]  We've got promises in Congress to repeal any of these executive orders immediately and slap them down.
[00:14:59.642 --> 00:15:00.642]  We've got Obamacare.
[00:15:01.182 --> 00:15:04.223]  With the legislation introduced to repeal it, about to pass the House.
[00:15:04.743 --> 00:15:07.923]  We have got so many exciting things to happen right now.
[00:15:08.403 --> 00:15:10.064]  Donald Trump, the whole nine yards.
[00:15:10.444 --> 00:15:13.384]  We are trying to bring the Republic back as best we can.
[00:15:13.684 --> 00:15:20.305]  And the Soros types that have done this in countless countries like Ukraine and other areas want civil insurrection.
[00:15:20.345 --> 00:15:21.425]  They want civil unrest.
[00:15:21.746 --> 00:15:24.466]  They want us fighting with each other at each other's throats.
[00:15:24.706 --> 00:15:28.047]  And the feds keep pushing and pushing and pushing to try to trigger this.
[00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:30.007]  And that's why I'm calling for everybody to be cool.
[00:15:30.825 --> 00:15:41.487]  That's why I'm calling for everybody to focus on what they're doing because as more people arrive out there, and Joe Biggs is about to be on screen there today reporting, as all of this unfolds,
[00:15:42.190 --> 00:16:07.735]  We need to understand that the establishment wins if things get violent and so it's very important to have a lot of cameras there to document everything that's unfolding so that hopefully if there's any provocateurs or troublemakers, you know, the sun comes up this morning, you know, fish swim in the sea, I mean you know it's going to be a magnet for this, then we need to take action to document it and to make sure the system can't spin this because folks,
[00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:13.704]  I've had them try to set me up with the Kill Michelle Malcolm stuff, and thank God we got footage that it was her operatives doing it.
[00:16:13.724 --> 00:16:16.086]  Not against Michelle Malcolm, but she did it, it's on video.
[00:16:16.546 --> 00:16:26.232]  I've had them try to set me up literally hundreds of times with similar things, with things I didn't do, or things I didn't say, or fake videos, supposedly, of what, I mean, I know the tricks, folks.
[00:16:26.713 --> 00:16:31.996]  But what counters that is having our own footage and having our people on the ground.
[00:16:32.036 --> 00:16:32.957]  So pray for Joe Biggs.
[00:16:33.517 --> 00:16:38.222]  Uh, and the rest of the crew, uh, uh, David Knight's son, Travis, is out there on the ground.
[00:16:38.242 --> 00:16:39.803]  Uh, so just pray for them.
[00:16:39.823 --> 00:16:46.349]  I'm gonna go ahead and hand this back to David Knight for the rest of the segment, the next, then my special report breaking this down, uh, at the 33 after.
[00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:51.414]  Please tell your friends and family to tune into the broadcast and, and just understand they're coming for the Second Amendment.
[00:16:51.434 --> 00:16:52.535]  They're coming for the First Amendment.
[00:16:52.755 --> 00:16:57.820]  They're coming for it all, but we don't want them to push us into moving first.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.302]  This is a key time.
[00:16:59.342 --> 00:17:01.745]  This could become 1776 Part 2.
[00:17:01.826 --> 00:17:02.366]  You're living it.
[00:17:02.587 --> 00:17:03.949]  We know the enemy's game plan.
[00:17:04.229 --> 00:17:06.012]  Let's not just stumble into their traps.
[00:17:06.292 --> 00:17:11.780]  Let's use the fact that we have their blueprint to absolutely defeat them at every level and pray for providence.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.443]  David Knight at the InfoWars News Center.
[00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:17.491]  Thank you, Alex, and of course we're going to have that special report from Alex at the bottom of the hour.
[00:17:17.951 --> 00:17:24.833]  We're also going to be joined by Lionel in the next hour, and we're going to take a look at some of the crazy things that have been happening this year.
[00:17:24.893 --> 00:17:31.355]  There's actually some things that are kind of funny in all of this serious news, so we'll be going over that with Lionel.
[00:17:32.076 --> 00:17:38.578]  A little bit of, I guess you could call it, graveyard humor as we look at some of these things coming at us.
[00:17:39.318 --> 00:17:50.321]  But when we look at what's going on out here, we look at, there's an article on Infowars.com that was picked up by Drudge, by Paul Joseph Watson, the Oregon standoff could boost Obama's gun control push, and of course it could.
[00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:54.583]  That's exactly, the timing is absolutely perfect.
[00:17:54.643 --> 00:18:05.906]  But I think that there is, there are other issues going on with this as well, and that's why it's very important that you look at something like this, not only tactically, but strategically.
[00:18:06.306 --> 00:18:11.052]  You know, I think this is a very bad idea, as I pointed out yesterday when I was on the radio.
[00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:13.554]  You're going to lose the moral high ground.
[00:18:13.895 --> 00:18:16.077]  I think this is a bad tactic, a bad strategy.
[00:18:16.197 --> 00:18:17.599]  It's bad PR.
[00:18:17.899 --> 00:18:18.059]  Okay?
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.361]  They're going to lose this moral high ground.
[00:18:19.421 --> 00:18:24.347]  Understand, when Pearl Harbor happened, and we pointed this out on the anniversary of Pearl Harbor,
[00:18:25.356 --> 00:18:29.559]  Very well documented that the US had broken the codes of the Japanese at that time.
[00:18:29.579 --> 00:18:31.141]  They knew precisely what was going on.
[00:18:31.441 --> 00:18:34.263]  They stood down at the top levels to allow that to happen.
[00:18:34.743 --> 00:18:36.585]  That's how important it was for them.
[00:18:36.605 --> 00:18:42.990]  They would sacrifice most of the Navy, all the battleships, so that they could have the moral high ground, so they could
[00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:47.633]  Be in a defensive war, rather than be seen as the aggressor.
[00:18:47.713 --> 00:18:49.395]  That is what's very important about this.
[00:18:49.535 --> 00:18:51.537]  That is where people have lost sight of this.
[00:18:51.557 --> 00:19:00.524]  And I want to play a clip from Oath Keepers, Stuart Rhodes, the leader there, talking about what happened with this, leading up to it, even before the takeover.
[00:19:00.544 --> 00:19:03.627]  And of course, with the takeover of the federal building, things have changed.
[00:19:03.647 --> 00:19:05.208]  That's why we sent our reporters out there.
[00:19:05.648 --> 00:19:07.270]  First of all, what Cliven Bundy said.
[00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:17.454]  He said, if the Hammonds won't stand up for their rights, if the sheriff and the county commissioners won't stand up for their rights, the people who are there as protesters, as patriots, they don't have anybody to fight.
[00:19:18.135 --> 00:19:22.456]  And yes, it was a legitimate thing to go there and to protest the injustice that was being done to this family.
[00:19:22.556 --> 00:19:27.879]  I have another great article from Kurt Nimmo pointing out why these people were targeted.
[00:19:28.419 --> 00:19:31.681]  It's because the federal government wants to steal their land.
[00:19:31.721 --> 00:19:33.242]  We've seen this story over and over again.
[00:19:33.282 --> 00:19:41.766]  We had an excellent article from Kurt Nemo yesterday, we talked about it on the news, talking about the constitutional background of the land grabs.
[00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:44.908]  And so with this, he talks about this particular case.
[00:19:44.948 --> 00:19:47.470]  We see this happening over and over again.
[00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:53.233]  But when we come back, we're going to play a clip from Stuart Rhodes essentially saying the same thing that Clive and Bundy said.
[00:19:53.553 --> 00:19:58.935]  And the reason why we didn't cover this other than the issues until we've got this takeover.
[00:19:59.196 --> 00:20:08.020]  Now this is playing into the hands not only for gun control, but also for what may happen when we face a pending economic collapse as we see the stock market going down.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.020]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.882]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?
[00:20:13.302 --> 00:20:15.123]  How would you like to never be cold again?
[00:20:15.663 --> 00:20:21.786]  This is Dale with Fortress Clothing, and I'm here to tell you, you will never be cold again with Fortress.

[00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:07.254]  Go to survivalistcamps.com, then plan on joining us at the Great American Outdoor Show in February in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
[00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:15.256]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[00:22:15.617 --> 00:22:19.260]  It caught me totally by surprise, and it involves FEMA.
[00:22:19.601 --> 00:22:22.583]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[00:22:23.024 --> 00:22:28.109]  Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[00:22:28.689 --> 00:22:32.710]  Watch the viral video at FEMA3.com before it disappears again.
[00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:38.672]  But be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is, they must know something we don't.
[00:22:39.212 --> 00:22:49.235]  Go to FEMA3.com to see the number one item you should be hoarding and why supplies of this critical item are so low or even completely sold out at many stores across America.
[00:22:49.955 --> 00:22:50.836]  Don't miss out.
[00:22:51.176 --> 00:22:55.901]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in recent days.
[00:22:56.381 --> 00:23:01.626]  Go to FEMA3.com and discover the number one most critical item in a crisis.

[00:23:08.129 --> 00:23:11.613]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:23:12.354 --> 00:23:12.875]  It's true.
[00:23:12.995 --> 00:23:16.940]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.003]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:23:19.543 --> 00:23:24.009]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[00:23:24.309 --> 00:23:36.927]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[00:24:16.545 --> 00:24:17.726]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:17.766 --> 00:24:21.669]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Monday, January the 4th, 2016.
[00:24:21.829 --> 00:24:29.174]  I want to get back to this standoff, and I want to give you a broader context of what's happening right now in the economic situation.
[00:24:29.574 --> 00:24:33.017]  Before I do, I just want to let you know real quickly, we have an InfoWars Life Resolution Pack.
[00:24:33.037 --> 00:24:35.339]  I don't know how much longer this special is going to last.

[00:25:12.813 --> 00:25:22.984]  Now, as we look at what's going on, of course, the context that we need to be aware of, and I wish that these people who are there, I believe the Bundys are acting in good faith.
[00:25:23.224 --> 00:25:25.767]  I don't believe that everybody there necessarily is.
[00:25:25.787 --> 00:25:28.910]  We always have agent provocateurs whenever you've got something like this, whether it's a
[00:25:29.511 --> 00:25:31.373]  Black Lives Protest matter.
[00:25:31.393 --> 00:25:36.138]  I mean that whole organization was heavily funded by George Soros operatives.
[00:25:36.158 --> 00:25:37.879]  There are a lot of people who are well-meaning in that.
[00:25:37.899 --> 00:25:48.170]  A lot of people are concerned about police brutality and violence and making sure that we get back to a more civil policing stance towards the public.
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:53.142]  But you always have the possibility that agent provocateurs are going to take something over.
[00:25:53.203 --> 00:25:58.966]  Whenever you have a protest in Ferguson, you always have the possibility that somebody is going to... You've got peaceful protesters out there.
[00:25:58.986 --> 00:25:59.967]  We covered that many times.
[00:25:59.987 --> 00:26:01.148]  We were there quite a bit.
[00:26:01.488 --> 00:26:03.709]  Joe Biggs, Jakari Jackson, reporters were there.
[00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:08.372]  And you had peaceful protesters who really wanted to see things structurally change.
[00:26:08.412 --> 00:26:15.157]  They were shut down when you had agent provocateurs go out and start literally throwing firebombs, burning buildings down.
[00:26:15.857 --> 00:26:17.879]  And of course we had people who would
[00:26:18.599 --> 00:26:21.881]  Go there, Oath Keepers, who would protect businesses who asked for their help.
[00:26:21.901 --> 00:26:26.884]  And we're going to play a clip from Stuart Rhodes to talk about how this particular situation is different.
[00:26:26.924 --> 00:26:32.548]  This is something he recorded on January the 1st before the takeover of that federal building.
[00:26:32.868 --> 00:26:38.191]  But before we get to that, I just want to talk about what's going on economically, because that's another context.
[00:26:38.472 --> 00:26:46.477]  Certainly today, Obama is going to have a one-hour dog-and-pony show with CNN selling the idea that he should do gun control by executive action.
[00:26:47.097 --> 00:26:50.880]  But of course we know that our government has been preparing for a financial meltdown.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:59.468]  We've been having the police militarized, we've been having military assets pre-positioned throughout the country in small town police departments.
[00:26:59.848 --> 00:27:02.671]  I know it's something that they're very worried about, very concerned about.
[00:27:03.431 --> 00:27:09.636]  And when we look at the New Year kicking off, we've got a 423 point decline as I last looked at.
[00:27:09.716 --> 00:27:12.158]  That's about a 2.4% decline in the Dow.
[00:27:12.699 --> 00:27:13.760]  And here's the interesting thing.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:17.723]  It was driven by a collapse in the Chinese stock market.
[00:27:18.123 --> 00:27:20.125]  And we don't know how far that would have gone.
[00:27:20.185 --> 00:27:21.206]  It went down 7% for the day.
[00:27:23.007 --> 00:27:25.590]  Because it activated a new circuit breaker.
[00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:30.916]  So the first day that they have a circuit breaker for plunging stock market, it gets triggered in China.
[00:27:31.317 --> 00:27:34.300]  And of course that is because orders are declining.
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.342]  People are very concerned about a depression.
[00:27:36.983 --> 00:27:41.168]  And that's supposedly the reason why the Federal Reserve was doing this quantitative easing.
[00:27:41.548 --> 00:27:50.760]  Putting out a, printing a great deal of money, putting it out there at 0% interest rate, and yet that money did not find its way into the economy, interestingly enough.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.163]  We've got another article, and this is back on Christmas Eve.
[00:27:53.743 --> 00:27:55.566]  I think it's worthwhile going back and looking at this.
[00:27:55.806 --> 00:27:58.009]  The Federal Reserve will pay banks $12 billion minimum in 2016.
[00:28:00.932 --> 00:28:07.497]  This is Jared Bilker, one of the Fed watchers in the business, wrote, in 2016, the Federal Reserve will pay at least $12.2 billion to U.S.
[00:28:07.517 --> 00:28:13.722]  and foreign bankers to keep the money created via its quantitative easing program out of the economy.
[00:28:14.362 --> 00:28:15.103]  Out of the economy.
[00:28:15.263 --> 00:28:19.246]  See, they're paying them money, they're paying them interest to keep this on deposit.
[00:28:20.177 --> 00:28:23.338]  The Fed raises rates as expected next year.
[00:28:23.378 --> 00:28:26.019]  The amount doubles to $23 billion.
[00:28:26.339 --> 00:28:31.080]  And they point out, never before have we seen this kind of stimulus go on for so long.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.502]  In other words, create such a large bubble, and now they're ready to bust the bubble.
[00:28:36.345 --> 00:28:37.206]  Remember what happened in 2008.
[00:28:37.266 --> 00:28:43.269]  We'd seen a very long period of time where the Fed, under Greenspan, had continually reduced interest rates.
[00:28:43.409 --> 00:28:49.232]  And then they began tiny little increases, each of them a little pinprick on this balloon until it burst.
[00:28:49.753 --> 00:28:50.693]  They've now begun that.
[00:28:51.073 --> 00:28:53.615]  So we don't really know how that's going to play out.
[00:28:53.975 --> 00:29:01.039]  We already see that the world economy, as measured from China, where most of the manufacturing has moved, is going down.
[00:29:01.099 --> 00:29:02.220]  So, when we look at this,
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:11.770]  And we look at the fact that they're pushing for executive order gun control and of course executive orders to bring in a massive number of new workers.
[00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:15.034]  That's another executive order that Obama has been pushing through.
[00:29:15.074 --> 00:29:19.399]  They are printing up millions, millions of green cards.
[00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:29.981]  I think the total, I've got it in my list here, I think it's 34 million that they look to do in the next, yes, 34 million blank green cards and work permits are going to be ordered.
[00:29:30.401 --> 00:29:32.561]  Now that's the context of where this is going.
[00:29:32.942 --> 00:29:39.243]  And when we come back from break, we're going to have Alex Jones with a report, don't help Obama take the guns.
[00:29:39.303 --> 00:29:42.863]  They want to get the guns because they're worried about domestic unrest.
[00:29:42.943 --> 00:29:45.664]  And this gives them a perfect backdrop.
[00:29:45.964 --> 00:29:49.707]  We don't need to be using this type of tactic, this type of strategy.
[00:29:49.847 --> 00:29:50.488]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:58.475 --> 00:29:59.376]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.876 --> 00:30:01.498]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.418 --> 00:30:05.101]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:17.561]  In response to President Obama's plan to enact gun control through executive order, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said, come and take it.
[00:30:18.161 --> 00:30:21.922]  Abbott tweeted out, quote, Obama wants to impose more gun control.
[00:30:22.342 --> 00:30:24.042]  My response, come and take it.
[00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:31.884]  The president will meet with Attorney General Laurie Lynch to discuss what executive actions he's going to take to infringe the Second Amendment while bypassing Congress.
[00:30:32.584 --> 00:30:37.125]  The word is he's going to try and prevent people on the government's no-fly list from being able to purchase firearms.
[00:30:37.805 --> 00:30:47.329]  But, as we previously reported, thousands of law-abiding Americans have been wrongly placed on the no-fly list due to false information, clerical errors, or political persecution.
[00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:55.173]  In fact, it violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process by allowing the government to deprive people of their rights based only on suspicion.
[00:30:55.753 --> 00:31:01.035]  In other words, Obama wants to dictatorially restrict the Second Amendment rights of thousands of Americans.
[00:31:01.736 --> 00:31:04.117]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com.
[00:31:09.116 --> 00:31:12.318]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:31:12.619 --> 00:31:20.645]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:31:20.865 --> 00:31:25.888]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:31:26.289 --> 00:31:28.590]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:31:40.186 --> 00:31:42.308]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:31:42.388 --> 00:31:47.131]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:31:47.391 --> 00:31:50.534]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:31:50.674 --> 00:31:53.896]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:31:54.177 --> 00:31:55.918]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:31:56.138 --> 00:31:57.038]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:31:57.058 --> 00:31:57.999]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:31:58.259 --> 00:32:00.140]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:08.464]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:32:08.844 --> 00:32:15.707]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.tv, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[00:32:15.747 --> 00:32:18.448]  We've always offered five months free.
[00:32:18.628 --> 00:32:24.191]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[00:32:24.531 --> 00:32:27.713]  PrisonPlanet.tv began 15 years ago.
[00:32:27.953 --> 00:32:30.935]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[00:32:31.235 --> 00:32:39.961]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:40.221 --> 00:32:49.087]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's, you also get to share that membership with up to 20 people simultaneously.
[00:32:49.247 --> 00:32:50.027]  We're good to go.
[00:33:18.852 --> 00:33:27.371]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:35.163 --> 00:33:42.730]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't let Obama be successful when it comes to starting civil unrest and riots in this country.
[00:33:43.111 --> 00:33:53.201]  They will use that as a civil emergency to bring in a type of soft martial law like Europe has done after they brought in all the jihadis and allowed them to attack.
[00:33:55.007 --> 00:33:58.610]  The stage is set for classical martial law in the United States.
[00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:11.320]  George Soros, who's overthrown many other countries using similar divide-and-conquer tactics, is on record funding Black Lives Matter and other groups, and the mainstream media is trying to exacerbate tension in local communities.
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:21.548]  And out of this crisis, they intend to bring in the quote, strong cities UN initiative that globalizes, internationalizes local government.
[00:34:22.148 --> 00:34:27.316]  It's political correctness intimidating people to submit to this international takeover.
[00:34:28.117 --> 00:34:35.047]  Now, it's been known for a long time and it's come out in federal court that many of the militias, though they're constitutional and made up of great people,
[00:34:36.121 --> 00:34:53.164]  end up getting infiltrated and led in many cases by federal provocateur or even worse by foundation provocateurs like the Southern Poverty Law Center that ran Ellingham City where the reported Oklahoma City bombing got hatched which we know was an inside job major false flag.
[00:34:54.876 --> 00:34:56.497]  2016 is here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:57.157 --> 00:34:58.258]  It is already the fourth.
[00:34:59.078 --> 00:35:04.721]  And all hell is breaking loose in the stock market, militarily overseas, so many issues.
[00:35:05.261 --> 00:35:08.522]  And the establishment is going to want a political diversion here in America.
[00:35:08.802 --> 00:35:16.246]  And they've been putting out the talking points that white terrorists are about to start attacking, that white terrorists are about to be involved in insurrection.
[00:35:16.846 --> 00:35:25.250]  While pushing the military, pushing veterans, pushing citizens of all race, colors, and creeds with more and more federal occupation, more and more federal tyranny.
[00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:26.670]  So let's be clear.
[00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.011]  We're about to go in here and show you some of the articles here in a moment.
[00:35:30.592 --> 00:35:35.454]  The Bundys and others have very legitimate issues with the federal power grab over land outside of law.
[00:35:35.814 --> 00:35:39.856]  And people doing controlled burns and being called arsonists and people being charged.
[00:35:40.885 --> 00:35:42.806]  The federal government is power grabbing everywhere.
[00:35:42.826 --> 00:35:43.226]  It's true.
[00:35:43.346 --> 00:35:43.886]  It's lawless.
[00:35:43.946 --> 00:35:46.067]  It's shutting down power plants outside of law.
[00:35:46.087 --> 00:35:47.847]  It's opening borders outside of law.
[00:35:48.067 --> 00:35:50.108]  It's funding ISIS and Al-Qaeda outside of law.
[00:35:50.448 --> 00:35:51.749]  But all that's coming out.
[00:35:52.429 --> 00:35:54.590]  And the establishment is in political trouble right now.
[00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:57.871]  So they want to overturn the chessboard right now.
[00:35:58.471 --> 00:36:01.892]  We need Americans to realize we're all being played off against each other.
[00:36:02.412 --> 00:36:04.093]  And to watch the weaponized media.
[00:36:05.271 --> 00:36:07.032]  on MSNBC and other places.
[00:36:07.552 --> 00:36:10.152]  Absolutely promoting race war in this country is out of control.
[00:36:10.613 --> 00:36:21.916]  That's why I'm here in Phoenix, and I'll tell you later in the broadcast, David Nightwell, who I'm interviewing, a key individual to hopefully work with to try to calm tensions and try to bring America together if it's possible.
[00:36:22.316 --> 00:36:25.857]  I mean, that's how serious the situation is, is that I'm working around the clock.
[00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:41.122]  I know a lot of people that are good inside the Pentagon that are working around the clock, good people in the Secret Service, but good people at the grassroots level of every race, color, and creed, liberal, conservative, libertarian, Muslim, you name it, who understand the larger globalist program for destabilization.
[00:36:41.422 --> 00:36:42.282]  We all have differences.
[00:36:42.302 --> 00:36:43.543]  We all have real beefs with each other.
[00:36:43.843 --> 00:36:44.523]  Nothing's perfect.
[00:36:45.083 --> 00:36:46.424]  Okay, and America has a lot of problems.
[00:36:46.844 --> 00:36:53.388]  But the globalists want to use those problems to basically bring it down into a truly fascistic system of total control.
[00:36:53.648 --> 00:36:55.069]  Let's go inside and look at some of these articles.
[00:37:01.089 --> 00:37:06.472]  Right here, singing in to provide an hour of air time to Obama's gun control pitch today.
[00:37:06.873 --> 00:37:11.316]  Town Hall, full pitch, and what it's really about is executive power outside of law.
[00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:16.759]  Then the even more hardcore gun control, I predict, is coming after this, but this is unprecedented.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:22.143]  The Hammonds, excellent article by Kurt Nemo, targeted because government wants to steal their land.
[00:37:22.443 --> 00:37:26.806]  The entire story by Kurt Nemo of how they stole the land, how they're stealing other people's land.
[00:37:27.913 --> 00:37:31.216]  How it's criminal, how it's wrong, how they've persecuted them.
[00:37:32.077 --> 00:37:33.799]  Absolutely, they've been wronged.
[00:37:34.079 --> 00:37:34.680]  Absolutely.
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:48.132]  My issue is the timing of this now allows the whole debate to not be about the gun grab, to not be about all the gun control, to not be about the victim disarmament, but to be about citizens with guns taking over buildings.
[00:37:48.613 --> 00:37:50.675]  It's an empty wildlife refuge building.
[00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:53.231]  The Feds are grabbing everybody's property in the area.
[00:37:53.251 --> 00:37:54.852]  They're the ones with armed force out of control.
[00:37:55.333 --> 00:37:58.815]  But again, it's the federal government, not even the Feds on the ground that are the problem.
[00:37:59.255 --> 00:38:01.657]  It's the whole UN agenda 21.
[00:38:01.957 --> 00:38:03.478]  But read that article, you'll understand it.
[00:38:03.879 --> 00:38:05.159]  Then the other perspective.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:09.663]  People are asking me, well why are you pro-Bundy and then anti-Bundy?
[00:38:09.683 --> 00:38:09.983]  We're not.
[00:38:10.223 --> 00:38:11.384]  We're showing both sides.
[00:38:12.244 --> 00:38:16.827]  And Paul Watts has written an article that's on DrugsReport.com, Oregon standoff.
[00:38:17.785 --> 00:38:19.685]  Could boost Obama's gun control push.
[00:38:19.885 --> 00:38:21.306]  I started saying this yesterday.
[00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:24.386]  As soon as we had the news early in the morning, this had started Saturday night.
[00:38:24.627 --> 00:38:26.047]  Curt Demond had already written about it Saturday night.
[00:38:26.747 --> 00:38:29.848]  And obviously by the time I looked it up, they were already blaming the Second Amendment.
[00:38:29.928 --> 00:38:30.548]  It's obvious.
[00:38:31.608 --> 00:38:32.628]  It's the timing of this.
[00:38:33.248 --> 00:38:33.589]  Okay?
[00:38:33.929 --> 00:38:36.149]  Plus, the Hammonds say they don't want the Bundys there.
[00:38:36.369 --> 00:38:37.209]  That's another problem.
[00:38:37.529 --> 00:38:41.070]  It was the grazing rights of the Bundys in Southern Nevada.
[00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:42.811]  That's why we supported them.
[00:38:42.991 --> 00:38:44.231]  They were in the right completely.
[00:38:45.168 --> 00:38:45.508]  Okay?
[00:38:46.009 --> 00:38:46.609]  Continuing.
[00:38:46.889 --> 00:38:54.374]  Liberal media tweets call for National Guard cops to confront the wildlife refuge occupiers.
[00:38:54.474 --> 00:38:56.776]  Many liberals want Waco-style response to government.
[00:38:56.796 --> 00:38:57.597]  They want them killed.
[00:38:57.837 --> 00:38:58.997]  See, it's all about race war.
[00:38:59.318 --> 00:39:03.741]  These are the Soros White House operatives already trying to make this racial.
[00:39:03.821 --> 00:39:04.801]  It has nothing to do with race.
[00:39:05.902 --> 00:39:08.284]  We're literally walking into their trap, and you know
[00:39:09.048 --> 00:39:10.529]  There's provocateurs there on the ground.
[00:39:10.869 --> 00:39:13.770]  Probably not even from the FBI, but from the big foundations.
[00:39:14.271 --> 00:39:15.791]  Just like we exposed Hal Turner and others.
[00:39:17.372 --> 00:39:19.793]  So continuing, the article is up on Infowars.com.
[00:39:19.833 --> 00:39:22.675]  You want the real breakdown of what's happening, there it is.
[00:39:23.335 --> 00:39:24.636]  Continuing, you heard this.
[00:39:24.676 --> 00:39:26.336]  This is the talking point just a few weeks ago.
[00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:27.537]  MSNBC.
[00:39:27.837 --> 00:39:28.697]  White terrorists.
[00:39:28.818 --> 00:39:30.318]  Not San Bernardino terrorists.
[00:39:30.578 --> 00:39:31.559]  Not Islamic terrorists.
[00:39:31.879 --> 00:39:33.900]  White terrorists are the problem.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.821]  Yet, you look at the data.
[00:39:36.565 --> 00:39:40.287]  Of white men with guns wreaking havoc on this country?
[00:39:40.628 --> 00:39:42.409]  Why aren't white men all coming forward?
[00:39:42.469 --> 00:39:44.130]  Why don't you call on them to do that?
[00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:49.213]  Boom, so it's all white men, they're the ones wreaking havoc even though statistically it's one of the lowest crime rates out there.
[00:39:49.813 --> 00:39:55.497]  Meanwhile, radical Muslims invade churches, throwing Christians out and beating them up in Germany.
[00:39:55.637 --> 00:39:58.678]  Articles, mainstream news, link in the article in fullwords.com.
[00:39:59.779 --> 00:40:01.721]  So that's what's really unfolding here.
[00:40:01.741 --> 00:40:04.744]  And then meanwhile, they want to distract from coming after our guns.
[00:40:04.764 --> 00:40:08.868]  They want to distract from the stock market plunging 450 plus points.
[00:40:09.208 --> 00:40:16.115]  They want to distract from all the things that are happening with this, quote, armed takeover that's happening.
[00:40:16.375 --> 00:40:18.698]  The FBI says they seek a peaceful end.
[00:40:18.998 --> 00:40:21.580]  Armed group vows to stay at Oregon refuge.
[00:40:22.475 --> 00:40:23.396]  I don't
[00:40:43.251 --> 00:40:46.897]  Documents back in 2000, rebuilding America's defenses, Project for an American Century.
[00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:50.964]  They said, we're going to help radicalize Muslims, get them funding, do all this stuff.
[00:40:51.285 --> 00:40:53.248]  You know, we need a big catalyzing attack in the West.
[00:40:54.144 --> 00:40:55.905]  This transcends administrations.
[00:40:55.925 --> 00:40:56.945]  The Democrats do it too.
[00:40:57.305 --> 00:41:01.406]  We're going to use this crisis then to invade the world, create a Pax Americana.
[00:41:01.906 --> 00:41:05.907]  But the real betrayal is it's not even a Pax Americana, an American empire.
[00:41:06.008 --> 00:41:08.548]  It's a globalist empire that we get to blame for.
[00:41:08.788 --> 00:41:10.489]  We get sucked dry and then we collapse.
[00:41:10.909 --> 00:41:11.869]  So that's the breakdown.
[00:41:12.369 --> 00:41:16.231]  David Knight's coming up with more a little bit later in the broadcast.
[00:41:16.591 --> 00:41:20.712]  We will tell you exactly why I'm here in Phoenix once the interview is underway for security reasons.
[00:41:22.372 --> 00:41:29.760]  It's great to have so many wonderful listeners out there, but I mentioned I was flying to Phoenix yesterday before I took off, and there were folks at the airport waiting for us, which was great to see them.
[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:35.846]  It's just that obviously the show is so giant now that not everybody out there listening are good guys.
[00:41:36.306 --> 00:41:38.869]  So again, Alex Jones signing off for InfoWars.com.
[00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:40.811]  Paul Watson's hosting the fourth hour today.
[00:41:41.111 --> 00:41:44.054]  Back to David Knight in the InfoWars News Center.
[00:41:44.314 --> 00:41:45.636]  I'll be hosting the show tomorrow.
[00:41:46.016 --> 00:41:48.337]  From Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:41:48.357 --> 00:41:51.237]  But back to David Knight and the Infowars News Center.
[00:41:51.438 --> 00:41:57.779]  Let's work together to try to stop what could brew into a controlled civil war to bring in a civil emergency.
[00:41:57.979 --> 00:42:00.240]  Let's keep the focus on the fact they're coming after our guns.
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:02.481]  Let's keep the focus on the fact they're opening our borders.
[00:42:02.781 --> 00:42:05.281]  Let's do like the governor said, come and take it from Texas.
[00:42:05.701 --> 00:42:07.102]  Governor Abbott over the weekend.
[00:42:08.191 --> 00:42:11.192]  You know, with state authorities saying no, that's what we need.
[00:42:12.073 --> 00:42:21.918]  Not these takeovers of an empty building that's perfect for the feds from all over the country to now infiltrate, stir stuff up, God knows do what.
[00:42:21.998 --> 00:42:22.938]  I mean, it's textbook.
[00:42:23.378 --> 00:42:33.383]  And anybody saying we shouldn't watch out for infiltrators, anybody saying we shouldn't be concerned for people calling for violence or unrest or civil disobedience is major league suspect.
[00:42:33.603 --> 00:42:36.345]  They're either as dumb as the day is long,
[00:42:37.405 --> 00:42:42.026]  Or they are playing to somebody else's tune, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:43.366]  1776 is an idea.
[00:42:43.466 --> 00:42:45.107]  We're winning the Info War right now.
[00:42:45.467 --> 00:42:49.388]  We do not want this to get physical, but if it does, let them shoot first.
[00:42:49.768 --> 00:42:53.889]  If they mean to have a battle, you know, as they famously said at Bunker Hill, then they'll let it start here today.
[00:42:54.129 --> 00:42:56.490]  Well, it already has started in the Info War.
[00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:57.050]  We're winning.
[00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:02.191]  Let's not give the big foundations in Soros and the Southern Primary Law Center and ADL what they want.
[00:43:02.847 --> 00:43:04.628]  They say the big war with Patriots is coming.
[00:43:04.648 --> 00:43:08.049]  They say they've given them the armored vehicles and that they're going to have war with us any minute.
[00:43:08.649 --> 00:43:11.170]  Let's not light the fuse for them, folks.
[00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:13.071]  Let's document everything that's happening.
[00:43:13.431 --> 00:43:15.391]  They'll undoubtedly are going to pull false flags.
[00:43:15.431 --> 00:43:16.412]  It's the season for it.
[00:43:16.672 --> 00:43:17.372]  It's in the cards.
[00:43:17.432 --> 00:43:18.672]  It's the right time for them to do it.
[00:43:18.993 --> 00:43:20.673]  I get in their mind and kind of look at what they would do.
[00:43:20.693 --> 00:43:25.675]  We need to be working hard to stop any terror attacks, working hard to frustrate them provocatory.
[00:43:25.955 --> 00:43:31.497]  But also, if something does happen, we need cameras there instantly to document everything.
[00:43:32.077 --> 00:43:33.940]  You are troops in the battle for this republic.
[00:43:35.122 --> 00:43:37.907]  You are troops for humanity's future freedom worldwide.
[00:43:38.087 --> 00:43:39.910]  No matter who you are, get involved.
[00:43:40.191 --> 00:43:41.332]  Realize how important you are.
[00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:44.137]  Realize how much you're needed in your corner of the world.
[00:43:45.086 --> 00:43:47.508]  To be watching and to be listening and to be taking action.
[00:43:48.109 --> 00:44:03.561]  And when you see something like a foreign global takeover of America, when you see them destroying our liberties and spying on us and forced inoculations, when you see something tyrannical, when you see them land grabbing, when you see them teaching kids their parents aren't their parents in public schools, when you see tyranny, say something.
[00:44:03.782 --> 00:44:04.762]  We are saying something.
[00:44:05.063 --> 00:44:05.963]  InfoWars.com.
[00:44:07.315 --> 00:44:07.816]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:44:07.836 --> 00:44:10.018]  And that was Alex Jones with his report on what's coming on.
[00:44:10.058 --> 00:44:16.925]  And tonight, of course, CNN is going to be providing one hour of airtime to Obama to sell his gun control.
[00:44:17.406 --> 00:44:23.552]  It's going to be at George Mason University, a one-hour live town hall before a live audience.
[00:44:23.672 --> 00:44:26.655]  And they have a report about this on InfoWars by Steve Watson.
[00:44:27.256 --> 00:44:32.118]  He says CNN has stated that Obama will attempt to, quote, make gun control part of his legacy.
[00:44:32.138 --> 00:44:34.859]  Yeah, he's got a 2016 wish list, alright.
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.241]  And of course, CBS News reported on this.
[00:44:37.301 --> 00:44:40.402]  He's been working with Climate Change.
[00:44:40.442 --> 00:44:44.964]  They just got that treaty approved in one way, one form or the other.
[00:44:45.004 --> 00:44:48.706]  And of course, the Republican Congress rushed to fund it.
[00:44:49.795 --> 00:44:56.163]  At first when they signed that accord and said, yeah, we're on board with these goals, the Republicans said, well, we'll have something to say about that.
[00:44:56.203 --> 00:44:57.584]  Yeah, they did have something to say about that.
[00:44:57.624 --> 00:44:59.206]  They immediately rubber stamped that.
[00:44:59.647 --> 00:45:03.071]  And of course, there's also the Trans-Pacific Partnership that he's going to ram through this year.
[00:45:03.731 --> 00:45:07.276]  CBS says that they think that'll happen as soon as February the 4th.
[00:45:07.636 --> 00:45:10.079]  And then there is gun control executive action.
[00:45:10.179 --> 00:45:11.720]  Those are the three things that he wants to do.
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:12.561]  Oh, wait a minute.
[00:45:12.601 --> 00:45:13.461]  There's something else, too.
[00:45:13.842 --> 00:45:17.785]  He wants to continue to open our borders to uncontrolled immigration.
[00:45:18.145 --> 00:45:23.349]  And to that extent, they have printed up 34 million green cards.
[00:45:23.389 --> 00:45:24.930]  That's what the contractors have done.
[00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:29.374]  But let's just take a look at this particular gun control thing, because this is what he's focusing on right now.
[00:45:30.134 --> 00:45:42.948]  And of course this, as Steve Watson points out, whether purposely or not, it coincides with the fifth anniversary of the shooting of former representative Gabrielle Giffords in an incident in Arizona that killed six others.
[00:45:43.669 --> 00:45:49.115]  Now they say that, he says in this article, he says, previous CNN events of this nature have been firmly partisan affairs.
[00:45:49.555 --> 00:45:49.975]  You think?
[00:45:50.175 --> 00:45:51.116]  You think it's going to be partisan?
[00:45:51.136 --> 00:45:51.636]  Of course it is.
[00:45:52.016 --> 00:46:00.361]  A recent CNN town hall with Hillary Clinton featured an audience full of her supporters throwing softballs clearly designed to bolster her policies.
[00:46:00.481 --> 00:46:08.065]  Kids coming up with little questions that somebody had written out for them just like we saw done with the Pope pushing that climate agenda.
[00:46:08.745 --> 00:46:12.387]  This is ironically going to be held at George Mason University.
[00:46:13.635 --> 00:46:14.195]  George Mason.
[00:46:14.735 --> 00:46:16.716]  Let's talk about the real George Mason.
[00:46:16.736 --> 00:46:22.419]  You know, just like we've got the real Rick Ross, and then we've got a phony Rick Ross.
[00:46:22.859 --> 00:46:25.320]  Well, the real George Mason said this about guns.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:29.721]  He said, to disarm the people is the most effective way to enslave them.
[00:46:30.302 --> 00:46:33.303]  And of course, George Mason was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.
[00:46:33.783 --> 00:46:40.525]  When we look at the founders, it's important to understand the context of what they were writing about when they wrote things like the Second Amendment, when they talked about the militia.
[00:46:40.965 --> 00:46:44.206]  The militia is not the National Guard, folks.
[00:46:44.347 --> 00:46:46.187]  That's what they're teaching our kids in school.
[00:46:46.207 --> 00:46:51.269]  As a matter of fact, 25 years ago, I had an employee who was the salutatorian at his high school.
[00:46:51.289 --> 00:46:57.571]  Sharp kid, except he was thoroughly propagandized and lied to by the high school there.
[00:46:57.731 --> 00:47:04.154]  They were telling him, oh no, you know, you need to get rid of guns, you gotta understand that the National Guard is the militia.
[00:47:04.234 --> 00:47:04.694]  No it isn't.
[00:47:05.254 --> 00:47:08.636]  This is what the people who wrote the Constitution said.
[00:47:08.896 --> 00:47:09.856]  George Mason, one of them.
[00:47:10.016 --> 00:47:10.657]  George Mason said,
[00:47:11.661 --> 00:47:13.502]  I asked, what is the militia?
[00:47:13.522 --> 00:47:15.463]  Then he gave you an answer if you want to listen to it.
[00:47:15.484 --> 00:47:19.906]  He said it consists of the whole people, except for a few public officials, okay?
[00:47:20.427 --> 00:47:21.768]  A few public officers.
[00:47:22.248 --> 00:47:23.108]  That's precisely it.
[00:47:23.629 --> 00:47:26.410]  The militia was set up to defend this country.
[00:47:26.751 --> 00:47:31.234]  To defend it against foreign invaders, to defend it against domestic tyranny.
[00:47:32.094 --> 00:47:33.235]  That was the real linchpin.
[00:47:33.856 --> 00:47:47.630]  The founders of our government realized that a standing army, a permanent army that did not disband except for a few people and controlling officers, they realized that a standing army would be used against the American people.
[00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:49.432]  So they wanted the people themselves to be armed.
[00:47:49.972 --> 00:47:51.734]  You always hear the phrase, boots on the ground.
[00:47:51.774 --> 00:47:57.240]  Yeah, you can go in, you can do a lot of damage, you can project a lot of power with the Air Force, which they didn't have at that time.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.303]  They kept a standing Navy as protection, as a buffer.
[00:48:00.323 --> 00:48:05.489]  And of course there were the Marines, which were permanently there, but they did not want to have a permanent standing Army.
[00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:08.232]  Now we have the largest Army in the world.
[00:48:09.273 --> 00:48:15.215]  And in number four position, if you wanted to count it as a separate army, are the American police at every level.
[00:48:15.815 --> 00:48:17.336]  We do have a standing army in America.
[00:48:17.616 --> 00:48:19.636]  We have an army that is standing on America.
[00:48:20.117 --> 00:48:24.318]  We have an army that is increasingly militarized, and that is our police.
[00:48:24.378 --> 00:48:29.520]  And then we have many people who are trying to use the military as police.
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:36.942]  And in that context, we need to be very concerned about the attempts of Obama and others to do gun control.
[00:48:37.222 --> 00:48:39.465]  to do an end around the Constitution.
[00:48:39.505 --> 00:48:45.353]  You know, it's like when he has these people that are going to stand up in this town hall meeting, understand what this is all about.
[00:48:45.733 --> 00:48:52.101]  This is a very cynical attempt to make his dictatorial tyranny look like it's coming from the people.
[00:48:52.682 --> 00:48:54.023]  Look like it's part of a democracy.
[00:48:54.564 --> 00:48:55.945]  We have a democratic republic.
[00:48:56.245 --> 00:49:00.048]  We have a constitution that respects our individual liberties.
[00:49:00.649 --> 00:49:07.355]  In that democratic republic, you don't take our rights by regulation without representation.
[00:49:07.415 --> 00:49:08.035]  You understand that?
[00:49:08.816 --> 00:49:12.459]  When you write executive orders, that's nothing but the work of a dictator.
[00:49:12.479 --> 00:49:18.304]  When you have a bureaucracy that writes regulations that is not accountable to the people, that is nothing but tyranny.
[00:49:19.107 --> 00:49:25.449]  We have to get that clear to people, and we have to get people to understand not only what the militia means, but what does infringement mean?
[00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:27.230]  It means a gradual process.
[00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:30.651]  It means a death by a thousand cuts, and that is what they've been doing.
[00:49:31.132 --> 00:49:33.733]  Now I want to go back and take a look at some of the reactions.
[00:49:34.753 --> 00:49:36.233]  To what's going on in Oregon.
[00:49:36.253 --> 00:49:38.814]  Of course, our reporters are on their way to the site.
[00:49:38.894 --> 00:49:39.854]  The weather is very heavy.
[00:49:39.874 --> 00:49:40.935]  It's about 21 degrees.
[00:49:40.995 --> 00:49:41.915]  Heavily snowing there.
[00:49:42.435 --> 00:49:44.135]  We expect to have them on in the third hour.
[00:49:44.736 --> 00:49:46.776]  Coming up in the next hour, we're going to have Lionel.
[00:49:46.796 --> 00:49:51.057]  We're going to look at some of the lighter, funnier things that have been coming up in the news.
[00:49:51.077 --> 00:49:52.158]  Because this has been pretty heavy.
[00:49:52.198 --> 00:49:53.658]  And folks, this is real serious.
[00:49:53.678 --> 00:49:56.559]  I mean, this is a matter of life and death for people.
[00:49:57.419 --> 00:49:58.779]  This is potentially.
[00:49:59.079 --> 00:50:01.140]  And right now, they're peaceful demonstrators.
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.001]  It's not really clear to me what their goals are.
[00:50:04.021 --> 00:50:05.943]  That's one of the problems I see with their tactics.
[00:50:05.983 --> 00:50:14.368]  And of course the bigger, broader, strategical problems are the fact that you've got this gun control meeting that is scheduled for today.
[00:50:14.628 --> 00:50:16.790]  Interesting how it is timed out there.
[00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:21.094]  Before we go to that, I just want to let you know about our specials that we have at InfoWars.
[00:50:21.655 --> 00:50:25.178]  We have the Resolution Pack that I just mentioned in the earlier segment.

[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:24.481]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:24.541 --> 00:54:25.642]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:54:25.802 --> 00:54:28.184]  I want to take a look at this article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:54:28.204 --> 00:54:29.225]  It's up on the Drudge Report.
[00:54:29.305 --> 00:54:31.987]  Oregon standoff could boost Obama's gun control push.
[00:54:32.627 --> 00:54:33.568]  And this is what Paul says.
[00:54:33.608 --> 00:54:43.415]  He says, some are concerned that the standoff in Oregon could be an ill-conceived move that will only serve to bolster Obama's gun control agenda as he prepares to unveil new executive orders to restrict firearms.
[00:54:43.435 --> 00:54:44.456]  That's what we were just talking about.
[00:54:44.476 --> 00:54:45.536]  They're going to have a town hall.
[00:54:45.556 --> 00:54:48.679]  They're going to have people stand up and say, we want you to do more.
[00:54:49.881 --> 00:54:51.364]  The Congress just isn't doing anything.
[00:54:51.384 --> 00:54:51.725]  You know what?
[00:54:52.046 --> 00:54:55.072]  We have a constitutional procedure for that to happen.
[00:54:55.814 --> 00:55:01.059]  But they're going to urge him, and he's going, oh, you know, you guys are twisting my arm, I'll just have to do it by dictate.
[00:55:01.739 --> 00:55:02.720]  That's what he's going to say.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:04.442]  And of course, this is just the beginning of it.
[00:55:05.082 --> 00:55:09.206]  Now I want to go back, and I want to play for you, because I'm very concerned about what's going on.
[00:55:09.246 --> 00:55:11.188]  As I said before, I think it's a very bad tactic.
[00:55:11.208 --> 00:55:13.690]  There's not a clear goal that they want to go to.
[00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:19.275]  And I want to play for you what Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers said on January the 1st.
[00:55:19.315 --> 00:55:19.996]  Let's roll that clip.
[00:55:21.305 --> 00:55:26.906]  Well, what I know is what I've heard from talking to him and Bundy and reading on his blog.
[00:55:27.666 --> 00:55:32.127]  Apparently, what's going on is they're scheduled to be sent back to prison.
[00:55:32.847 --> 00:55:49.731]  The judge originally had sentenced them to only a year, and they served their time, but then the government appealed that decision, and the Mass Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the judge had not sentenced them according to the guidelines, and so they ended in, I believe, a five-year sentence.
[00:55:51.331 --> 00:55:56.634]  What I know is that the Hammonds at this time don't want anybody to try to stop that from happening.
[00:55:56.814 --> 00:56:01.277]  So I think it's one of the main problems with people wanting to intervene is they don't want our help.
[00:56:02.077 --> 00:56:06.299]  I don't think it's right for us to go in there and try to force them to accept our help.
[00:56:06.419 --> 00:56:07.420]  You know what I mean?
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:14.744]  It's kind of like with Kim Davis, without her protection against the US Marshals arresting her again for contempt of court, what would happen?
[00:56:14.764 --> 00:56:16.785]  Alright, that's a key point that he's making there.
[00:56:16.865 --> 00:56:19.787]  What he said was you can't help somebody who does not want your help.
[00:56:20.598 --> 00:56:24.161]  You are not, if they're not willing and ready to take a hard stand themselves.
[00:56:24.201 --> 00:56:26.704]  You understand, freedom cannot be given.
[00:56:27.184 --> 00:56:27.885]  It must be taken.
[00:56:28.265 --> 00:56:32.209]  The people who you're trying to get freedom for, they have to want it themselves.
[00:56:32.469 --> 00:56:33.630]  They have to want it badly.
[00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:34.591]  Okay?
[00:56:34.671 --> 00:56:37.293]  It is not something that is just easily handed out to people.
[00:56:37.333 --> 00:56:42.138]  If you could hand it out like candy, those people would then turn around and lose it very quickly.
[00:56:42.598 --> 00:56:50.127]  Now, he goes on and points out different ways that the militia, that the Oath Keepers have helped in the past, that have been very productive.
[00:56:50.147 --> 00:56:54.272]  And of course we've talked about what happened in the Sugar Pine mine there also in Oregon.
[00:56:54.613 --> 00:56:57.316]  You had a situation there and we reported on that many times.
[00:56:58.317 --> 00:57:03.201]  Where the BLM, again, was going to come in and knock the buildings to the ground.
[00:57:03.482 --> 00:57:08.326]  This is a mine that they had legal title to going back to the 1870s.
[00:57:08.366 --> 00:57:10.988]  It had a legal right to it, but of course the BLM wants to change all that.
[00:57:11.008 --> 00:57:23.339]  They want to confiscate the property throughout the rural areas, negate all of these, and understand that when you've got grazing rights, when you've got mining rights, those are rights that are just as tangible as the deed to your home.
[00:57:23.899 --> 00:57:25.781]  So that's like the government coming in and saying, you know what?
[00:57:26.321 --> 00:57:33.903]  We're going to take through eminent domain, we're going to take your home, but we're going to turn it over to somebody who's going to use it a little bit more effectively.
[00:57:34.083 --> 00:57:35.464]  Ah, we've heard that before, haven't we?
[00:57:35.904 --> 00:57:42.746]  That's the Kello v. London Supreme Court decision that said, yeah, the government can take your property and they can hand it over to a corporation.
[00:57:42.786 --> 00:57:51.568]  Then we saw with the Trans-Pacific, I'm sorry, with the Keystone Pipeline, we saw that TransCanada was coming in and condemning property.
[00:57:51.608 --> 00:57:53.849]  So you've got a foreign, multinational corporation
[00:57:54.594 --> 00:57:58.275]  And our government is turning it over to them, a private corporation.
[00:57:58.795 --> 00:58:00.336]  That's not what the Constitution allows.
[00:58:00.656 --> 00:58:03.656]  So in this situation in the mine, what they did was they said, we need some help.
[00:58:04.237 --> 00:58:19.160]  They went on site and made sure that due process was followed, that these people had their time to adjudicate this, that the BLM was not going to act precipitously, as we've seen them do so many times, come in and completely destroy the property there.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.181]  We saw the same thing happen in Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:58:21.701 --> 00:58:26.446]  When those protests turned into riots, people, business owners there, asked Oath Keepers for protection.
[00:58:26.466 --> 00:58:28.548]  And they said, fine, we will protect your property.
[00:58:28.968 --> 00:58:31.491]  And that's exactly what happened at the Bundy Ranch.
[00:58:31.871 --> 00:58:35.915]  The Bundy Ranch was a Waco-style situation that was developing.
[00:58:35.955 --> 00:58:37.637]  We saw they had free speech areas.
[00:58:37.797 --> 00:58:40.320]  It was repulsive to people, but they all stood together.
[00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:41.381]  The community stood together.
[00:58:41.721 --> 00:58:43.943]  That's not what is happening here in Oregon.
[00:58:44.244 --> 00:58:44.684]  Stay with us.
[00:58:44.844 --> 00:58:45.465]  We'll be right back.

[01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:44.542]  In the next segment, we're going to be joined by Lionel, the talk show host and broadcaster, and we're going to look at some of the lighter strange news that's been coming out the last few days.
[01:00:45.182 --> 01:00:52.306]  Of course, most of it still has a pretty heavy underlier there, but there was an interesting article that came out.
[01:00:52.847 --> 01:00:54.428]  I think it was on the Drudge Report.
[01:00:54.448 --> 01:00:55.448]  Yes, it was on the Drudge Report.
[01:00:55.488 --> 01:00:57.850]  Why globalizers still retain the upper hand.
[01:00:58.581 --> 01:01:01.603]  We need to understand where the real lines are drawn here.
[01:01:01.623 --> 01:01:08.847]  They want to get us fighting with each other, having the blacks versus the whites, having the city dwellers versus the urban dwellers.
[01:01:08.867 --> 01:01:20.034]  You know, we can see that in the media reactions where liberals are tweeting and calling for the National Guard to get violent with these people who haven't been violent at this facility that they've taken over at the Wildlife Refuge.
[01:01:20.715 --> 01:01:22.676]  They're saying, you know, end white terror.
[01:01:23.296 --> 01:01:26.939]  Well, what they're really calling for is for white lives to be ended.
[01:01:27.699 --> 01:01:30.420]  How about that White Lives Matter thing, right?
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:39.842]  They don't really care about anything other than dividing people by race, dividing people, as I said, in the city versus people in the rural areas.
[01:01:40.222 --> 01:01:41.282]  It's all about division.
[01:01:41.422 --> 01:01:43.603]  But we need to understand where the true division is.
[01:01:43.623 --> 01:01:53.746]  And that's why I think this article that was put up, it was Financial Times and Drudge linked to it, it was on December 30th, said why the globalizers still retain the upper hand.
[01:01:53.806 --> 01:01:55.186]  Now, I don't think that they do.
[01:01:56.144 --> 01:02:05.188]  But of course, this article makes a good point that the real division is between the globalists and the people who they call nationalists.
[01:02:05.208 --> 01:02:08.329]  But I would include everyone who wants self-governance in that.
[01:02:08.369 --> 01:02:13.491]  They say all over the world, globalization is under challenge from resurgent nationalist forces.
[01:02:14.071 --> 01:02:21.481]  One of the great political challenges of the coming year will be to defend the benefits of globalization while fending off the arguments of nationalists like Ms.
[01:02:21.521 --> 01:02:24.245]  Le Pen, Donald Trump, and the U.S.
[01:02:24.285 --> 01:02:27.189]  and his new admirer, Vladimir Putin of Russia.
[01:02:28.191 --> 01:02:34.237]  So they see it as the fact that they've already won, that they're flooding our countries with immigrants whether we like it or not.
[01:02:34.277 --> 01:02:43.667]  And of course Obama is not just going to have executive orders about gun control, he's going to have executive orders printing out 34 million blank green cards.
[01:02:43.707 --> 01:02:49.413]  This is about shipping our jobs overseas with the Trans-Pacific Partnership and then importing the workers
[01:02:50.014 --> 01:02:51.434]  For an economic collapse.
[01:02:51.775 --> 01:02:53.755]  To remake the country into what they want it to be.
[01:02:53.775 --> 01:02:56.236]  And that is something that is easily controlled.
[01:02:56.376 --> 01:02:58.017]  A third world economy.
[01:02:58.077 --> 01:02:59.797]  That's what they're trying to create here in America.
[01:03:00.338 --> 01:03:05.359]  They're trying to destroy our wealth, and they're trying to stop our income capabilities.
[01:03:05.519 --> 01:03:07.540]  And that's the basis of this article.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:08.520]  I thought it was very interesting.
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:12.462]  They say, of course we're going to have enhanced global trade and international investment.
[01:03:12.482 --> 01:03:15.583]  That's what the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Transatlantic Partnerships are about.
[01:03:15.883 --> 01:03:17.003]  It's about globalism.
[01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:18.624]  It's about concentration of power.
[01:03:19.324 --> 01:03:21.567]  To the international level.
[01:03:22.347 --> 01:03:29.735]  And if you think that the abuse of the federal government is bad, and it is, it comes about because we don't have a say in this.
[01:03:29.815 --> 01:03:36.142]  This is an out-of-control, unelected, unrepresentative bureaucracy that is far from the people that they are governing.
[01:03:36.883 --> 01:03:44.288]  And if you think that that is arrogant and out of control, wait until that is replaced with a global version of the federal government.
[01:03:44.588 --> 01:03:46.910]  It is going to be far worse once we see that.
[01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:54.355]  And they're going to push this, and of course, that is the essence of the battle that we're in, and we need to remember that.
[01:03:54.655 --> 01:04:04.341]  So the best response to the Nationalists in the West and elsewhere is often not to dismiss their concerns, but to demonstrate that their proposed solutions are impractical or dangerous.
[01:04:05.242 --> 01:04:11.106]  That is why it is so dangerous to do the types of things that are being done now by the protesters.
[01:04:11.146 --> 01:04:18.312]  Taking over that wildlife refuge makes citizen ownership of guns look dangerous to the public.
[01:04:18.372 --> 01:04:19.593]  That is how they're going to spin it.
[01:04:20.393 --> 01:04:22.454]  And it is absolutely the wrong way to proceed.
[01:04:22.494 --> 01:04:23.855]  It is absolutely the wrong time.
[01:04:24.135 --> 01:04:30.078]  We heard from Stuart Rhodes saying, look, you don't need to go in there and force yourself on these people.
[01:04:30.118 --> 01:04:31.298]  They got ahead of the community.
[01:04:31.838 --> 01:04:33.779]  The community is afraid of the government.
[01:04:33.819 --> 01:04:36.821]  They are afraid of the militia members that were there.
[01:04:37.481 --> 01:04:43.807]  We even had Clive and Bundy said, hey, look, if the sheriff and the community won't stand up for the rights, if they won't stand up for the rights, what are we doing there?
[01:04:44.087 --> 01:04:45.348]  We're not even from that area.
[01:04:45.508 --> 01:04:48.631]  I think it's the wrong time, the wrong place to make that stand.
[01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:49.532]  Now, stay with us.
[01:04:49.572 --> 01:04:54.496]  When we come back, we're going to be talking to Lionel, and we're going to look at some of the lighter things in the news.
[01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:59.340]  Yeah, we've got a gorilla lecturing us on how to save the planet.
[01:04:59.481 --> 01:05:02.383]  And you know, when the gorilla in the room talks, people listen.
[01:05:03.004 --> 01:05:03.384]  Or do they?
[01:05:03.604 --> 01:05:04.145]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:09.059 --> 01:05:14.361]  Want to keep up to date with what's going on in the world without logging into the internet ghettos of Facebook and Twitter?

[01:06:08.968 --> 01:06:15.789]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[01:06:15.869 --> 01:06:18.570]  We've always offered five months free.
[01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:24.311]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[01:06:24.671 --> 01:06:27.974]  PrisonPlanet.tv began 15 years ago.
[01:06:28.094 --> 01:06:31.196]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[01:06:31.376 --> 01:06:39.902]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:40.343 --> 01:06:49.189]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's, you also get to share that membership with up to 20 people simultaneously.
[01:06:49.389 --> 01:06:50.150]  We're good to go.
[01:07:08.914 --> 01:07:11.895]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:07:12.115 --> 01:07:14.255]  Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:14.475 --> 01:07:21.177]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[01:07:36.221 --> 01:07:44.848]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:52.014]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spite G-Rex herbal processing technique.

[01:09:31.724 --> 01:09:34.085]  It's the biggest special we've ever had on Prison Planet TV.
[01:09:34.105 --> 01:09:36.867]  We always run a special at the turn of the year.
[01:09:37.388 --> 01:09:40.009]  Typically in the past it's been something like five months.
[01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:43.352]  We're now going six months for free when you sign up for one year.
[01:09:43.972 --> 01:09:45.473]  That's how you can share information.
[01:09:45.533 --> 01:09:51.795]  That's how you can wake people up by giving them access to all of the online documentaries that Alex Jones has produced.
[01:09:51.815 --> 01:09:56.517]  They're all available to Prison Planet TV members and it's a way that you can support our operation.
[01:09:56.577 --> 01:10:03.900]  Again, that's Prison Planet TV, six months for free right now for a limited time if you sign up for a one-year subscription.
[01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:09.932]  Now, our guest right now, Lionel, is an Emmy award-winning television news decoder and legal analyst.
[01:10:10.072 --> 01:10:13.673]  I've got some legal questions I want to ask him here about what's going on in Oregon.
[01:10:14.053 --> 01:10:17.234]  He's a licensed trial lawyer and a former prosecutor.
[01:10:17.254 --> 01:10:22.155]  You can find him at lionelmedia.com or on Twitter at Lionel Media.
[01:10:22.215 --> 01:10:23.476]  That's his Twitter handle.
[01:10:23.836 --> 01:10:24.796]  Thank you for joining us, Lionel.
[01:10:25.396 --> 01:10:25.896]  Thank you.
[01:10:25.916 --> 01:10:26.937]  Happy New Year to you, sir.
[01:10:27.237 --> 01:10:27.537]  Thank you.
[01:10:27.577 --> 01:10:28.257]  Happy New Year to you.
[01:10:28.297 --> 01:10:30.318]  What do you think about this situation in Oregon?
[01:10:30.338 --> 01:10:31.118]  What's your take on this?
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:32.380]  Not good.
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:33.621]  Not good at all.
[01:10:34.881 --> 01:10:37.602]  This is going to harm the cause more than anything else.
[01:10:37.922 --> 01:10:38.202]  I agree.
[01:10:38.222 --> 01:10:44.884]  Because this plays into, David, the meme that these are a bunch of lunatics.
[01:10:45.405 --> 01:10:53.307]  And whenever you see somebody do this, the Constitution, whenever somebody holds... Oh, it is frozen.
[01:10:53.347 --> 01:10:54.468]  We've got a frozen feed there.
[01:10:54.568 --> 01:10:55.568]  Oh, there we go.
[01:10:55.648 --> 01:10:56.068]  We're back.
[01:10:56.168 --> 01:10:57.229]  Go ahead.
[01:10:57.249 --> 01:10:59.989]  I did like that effect, by the way, where I'm just frozen like that.
[01:11:00.109 --> 01:11:00.450]  That's right.
[01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:01.410]  Holding up the Constitution.
[01:11:02.771 --> 01:11:03.171]  Exactly.
[01:11:03.552 --> 01:11:07.675]  But you know, David, I have spent my adult life studying it.
[01:11:08.015 --> 01:11:12.298]  I've had to study for bar exams and regular exams.
[01:11:12.939 --> 01:11:17.282]  And it's a fabulous, wonderful document, which I'd like to keep.
[01:11:17.762 --> 01:11:19.744]  But it doesn't cover everything!
[01:11:20.164 --> 01:11:32.773]  There's nothing in the Constitution about the Air Force, about the number of Supreme Court Justices, Congressional Districts, marriage, separation of powers, the exclusionary rule, nothing about Congressional Districts, nothing!
[01:11:33.033 --> 01:11:34.595]  There's a Supremacy Clause of Article 6.
[01:11:35.355 --> 01:11:43.581]  You just don't pick this thing up and say, well, there's nothing about Bureau of Land Management, so I can take it by force.
[01:11:44.142 --> 01:11:44.322]  Look,
[01:11:45.723 --> 01:11:51.872]  My entire life, I have been an advocate of the Second Amendment of the Constitution.
[01:11:52.573 --> 01:11:59.102]  I was in the state of Florida, as you know, where we had carry permits pert-near before anybody did.
[01:11:59.955 --> 01:12:00.795]  I'm not a hunter.
[01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:02.396]  Not that there's anything wrong with hunting.
[01:12:03.036 --> 01:12:04.977]  I've never shot at a living human being.
[01:12:05.478 --> 01:12:07.178]  But I believed in this thing.
[01:12:07.318 --> 01:12:10.380]  And all of my friends, David, were just rational.
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.761]  We were very, very, and are very, very careful of guns.
[01:12:14.382 --> 01:12:15.762]  Don't think kids should have them.
[01:12:16.162 --> 01:12:17.603]  They should be made secure.
[01:12:17.623 --> 01:12:25.727]  If you have the slightest doubt whether you could fire one, either in protection of your family or whatever, don't have them.
[01:12:26.227 --> 01:12:27.227]  We were rational.
[01:12:27.527 --> 01:12:27.988]  And then,
[01:12:29.148 --> 01:12:37.801]  All of a sudden, folks are walking around with AR-15s and making my cause look ludicrous.
[01:12:38.341 --> 01:12:41.366]  And I'm trying to defend this constantly.
[01:12:42.007 --> 01:12:44.750]  And I'm not suggesting that the Bundys
[01:12:46.289 --> 01:12:47.870]  This is an inside job.
[01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:57.034]  But at the White House, Obama about to basically take another step towards disarmament, which is what every government wants.
[01:12:57.674 --> 01:13:05.638]  I'm sorry whether, I don't care what country you're in, whether you're a president, prime minister, you don't want your people armed!
[01:13:05.838 --> 01:13:08.259]  The White House is thinking, can you believe this?
[01:13:08.819 --> 01:13:10.059]  This is perfect!
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.121]  And then, don't call this a militia!
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:18.662]  Don't conflate militias and Second Amendment!
[01:13:19.642 --> 01:13:23.184]  And when the Hammonds themselves are saying, get out of here!
[01:13:23.584 --> 01:13:24.484]  Go away!
[01:13:24.504 --> 01:13:28.846]  Even Cliven is saying, I don't even know what we're doing here.
[01:13:28.866 --> 01:13:30.907]  Right.
[01:13:31.067 --> 01:13:39.731]  I just, look, if you want to talk about the unconstitutional appropriation of territory, of property,
[01:13:40.154 --> 01:13:41.976]  Look at the civil forfeiture laws.
[01:13:42.156 --> 01:13:42.376]  Yes.
[01:13:42.537 --> 01:13:44.278]  Look at what's going on every single day.
[01:13:44.539 --> 01:13:51.706]  David, you would not believe at major airports, the police details that do nothing but seize money and cash.
[01:13:52.207 --> 01:13:52.427]  Yes.
[01:13:52.467 --> 01:13:54.209]  With no evidence of any.
[01:13:54.649 --> 01:14:00.475]  So I'm all for the Constitution, but I'm not this.
[01:14:01.477 --> 01:14:01.597]  Yes.
[01:14:02.097 --> 01:14:02.498]  No!
[01:14:02.698 --> 01:14:10.772]  I think it's very important, you know, I'm looking at these articles about Obama using executive orders to enact gun control and there was a quote from
[01:14:12.048 --> 01:14:20.274]  Bloomberg's gun control group, Everytown, and they said only half the people who are tried for selling guns without a license are convicted by juries.
[01:14:20.394 --> 01:14:22.135]  You know, that's jury nullification.
[01:14:22.456 --> 01:14:23.736]  That's something that is in our power.
[01:14:23.777 --> 01:14:29.661]  We're leaving one of our most powerful tools on the ground because we don't know about it.
[01:14:29.741 --> 01:14:33.844]  And that's something we could use to shut down an out-of-control government at every level.
[01:14:34.785 --> 01:14:37.449]  Or even easier, how about just not guilty?
[01:14:37.709 --> 01:14:38.730]  Yes, exactly.
[01:14:38.751 --> 01:14:42.936]  I mean, I don't want to be found, be acquitted via jury nullification.
[01:14:43.096 --> 01:14:45.600]  I want to be found not guilty because they didn't prove their case.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:49.885]  Look, let me just start, and this has nothing to do
[01:14:50.984 --> 01:14:52.845]  David, I want to think of a new concept.
[01:14:52.885 --> 01:14:53.585]  I want to teach everybody.
[01:14:54.746 --> 01:14:56.707]  It's called instrument-rated politics.
[01:14:57.407 --> 01:15:02.049]  I want you to imagine you're a pilot and you're looking down at the instrument panel.
[01:15:02.730 --> 01:15:04.831]  You don't know what weather it is, what time it is.
[01:15:04.991 --> 01:15:05.491]  You're not.
[01:15:05.631 --> 01:15:08.652]  You're just looking and you're saying, we are in trouble here.
[01:15:09.533 --> 01:15:10.913]  I don't have to look out and see this.
[01:15:10.933 --> 01:15:11.894]  We're upside down.
[01:15:11.994 --> 01:15:13.034]  Yep, we're upside down.
[01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:21.846]  I base my political observations not on who's the president, not on whether it's a Democrat or Republican.
[01:15:22.066 --> 01:15:25.090]  I look at this right now and I'm saying, this is not good.
[01:15:25.931 --> 01:15:29.055]  And it has not been good for years.
[01:15:29.636 --> 01:15:32.940]  So it's not that Obama wants to seize it.
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:36.062]  I don't care if it's Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton.
[01:15:36.522 --> 01:15:44.748]  Presidents of the United States are handed a script and the first thing they want to do is to disarm the population.
[01:15:45.508 --> 01:15:51.452]  You don't want people, your citizens, to be able to fight back.
[01:15:51.712 --> 01:15:53.153]  It's axiomatic.
[01:15:53.934 --> 01:15:55.314]  That being said,
[01:15:56.435 --> 01:16:03.479]  Our cause is being made to look like a bunch of redneck hayseed Jethro's out there.
[01:16:03.499 --> 01:16:15.465]  And the sad part is, is that there are a lot of us, this is with all due respect to hayseed Jethro's, but there are a lot of us who say, wait a minute, let us do this the proper way.
[01:16:15.945 --> 01:16:17.966]  Let us look at this thing rationally.
[01:16:18.526 --> 01:16:21.328]  Our cause has been completely
[01:16:23.249 --> 01:16:26.992]  Just stripped bare of any rational thought in the media.
[01:16:27.492 --> 01:16:35.758]  And by the way, those people who believe in the right to possess a firearm, for whatever reason, it's not about plinking cans and hunting deer.
[01:16:35.778 --> 01:16:42.482]  It has nothing to do with sexuality and extensions of manhood and all of those usual things.
[01:16:43.083 --> 01:16:44.224]  But when you have
[01:16:45.273 --> 01:16:55.346]  Cases like this, it does more to harm the cause because right now at the White House, Obama and his folks are saying, I can't believe this.
[01:16:55.726 --> 01:16:57.488]  I could not have written.
[01:16:57.769 --> 01:16:59.110]  Can you believe these people?
[01:17:00.452 --> 01:17:04.697]  Well, talking about this being something that transcends Obama, you're exactly right.
[01:17:04.837 --> 01:17:11.965]  The mandatory minimum, if you want to put it that way, goes back to the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.
[01:17:13.487 --> 01:17:14.408]  And so you had a situation.
[01:17:14.428 --> 01:17:17.732]  Let me read you a quote, Lionel, from what the judge said in this particular case.
[01:17:18.753 --> 01:17:28.746]  When he looked at this and the sentencing, I don't know if it was a guideline or mandatory minimum, but it said it struck the judge presiding over the sentencing as too harsh and off base in this instance.
[01:17:28.766 --> 01:17:30.368]  And I'm quoting NPR here.
[01:17:30.428 --> 01:17:33.672]  This is not a conservative right-wing publication saying this.
[01:17:33.893 --> 01:17:34.714]  And here's a quote from him.
[01:17:35.094 --> 01:17:40.377]  He said, it just would not be, would not meet any idea I have of justice, proportionally.
[01:17:40.757 --> 01:17:43.719]  He says, I'm not supposed to use the word fairness in criminal law.
[01:17:44.019 --> 01:17:48.061]  I know that I had a criminal law professor a long time ago yell at me for doing that, and I don't do it.
[01:17:48.381 --> 01:17:52.044]  But this, it would be a sentence that would shock the conscience to me.
[01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:59.768]  This was such a minor offense, and we can talk about what the BLM was up against, but here's a situation where the judge is told that he doesn't have any discretion.
[01:18:00.488 --> 01:18:04.130]  Okay, and the judges are telling the jurors that they don't have any discretion.
[01:18:04.450 --> 01:18:07.051]  And what I'm saying is, you're saying, how about being found innocent?
[01:18:07.291 --> 01:18:14.074]  All it takes is one person to say, I'm not going to send this person to jail because the penalty is too harsh.
[01:18:14.094 --> 01:18:16.535]  Yeah, he may have had a fire that got out of hand.
[01:18:16.835 --> 01:18:19.176]  In one case, it burned 139 acres of land.
[01:18:19.196 --> 01:18:21.056]  In another case, it burned one acre of land.
[01:18:21.337 --> 01:18:23.497]  This is something the BLM does all the time.
[01:18:23.537 --> 01:18:29.780]  The BLM has had these same type of fires that have gotten out of control, have destroyed homes, and they haven't compensated people for it.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.624]  So this judge looks at it and goes, I don't really know why we're doing this.
[01:18:32.644 --> 01:18:38.611]  Yeah, factually, the jury says, well, you know, if we got to just judge the facts of the case, yeah, they did have a fire, so I guess they're guilty.
[01:18:38.912 --> 01:18:47.063]  The judge tries to put some common sense into this, and then we got the federal government coming back with a vendetta trying to continually push this into lunatic land.
[01:18:47.847 --> 01:18:50.288]  Well, hats off to Judge Michael Hogan.
[01:18:50.908 --> 01:18:52.809]  And this goes to show you a couple of points here.
[01:18:52.829 --> 01:18:55.210]  Number one, the benefit of having lifetime tenure.
[01:18:55.570 --> 01:18:57.471]  See, this is a great part about being a federal judge.
[01:18:57.871 --> 01:19:04.514]  When you've got a brave, intrepid soul like this judge, he says, I don't need no, I can do whatever I want.
[01:19:04.714 --> 01:19:05.434]  I'm not elected.
[01:19:05.454 --> 01:19:07.375]  The only way you can get rid of me is to impeach me.
[01:19:07.415 --> 01:19:09.516]  And I'm here for life and I can do whatever I want.
[01:19:09.556 --> 01:19:10.056]  That's number one.
[01:19:10.076 --> 01:19:11.857]  Number two, this goes to show you
[01:19:12.717 --> 01:19:15.820]  The problems with minimum mandatory sentences.
[01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:16.120]  Yes.
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:25.987]  You've got a judge who is, you, we, we elect and appoint to use discretion to sit back and say, I've heard the facts of this case.
[01:19:26.568 --> 01:19:27.609]  This is different.
[01:19:28.089 --> 01:19:30.351]  Not all cases are the same.
[01:19:30.931 --> 01:19:34.474]  You see this all the time with minimum mandatories, with enhanced penalties.
[01:19:34.794 --> 01:19:36.355]  You see three strikes, you're out.
[01:19:37.256 --> 01:19:42.949]  Those attempts by the legislature to wrest control from those individuals.
[01:19:43.150 --> 01:19:44.814]  But David, I want to go back to something.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:50.985]  I don't care whether you, not you, but you rhetorically like guns.
[01:19:51.045 --> 01:19:57.813]  Look, gay marriage, I happen to be in favor of the constitutional right for gay marriage.
[01:19:58.173 --> 01:19:58.914]  I'm not gay.
[01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:00.296]  It doesn't matter to me.
[01:20:00.656 --> 01:20:03.079]  But it doesn't have to matter to me for me to care.
[01:20:03.419 --> 01:20:03.819]  Exactly.
[01:20:03.859 --> 01:20:04.740]  Hold that thought, Lionel.
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:05.541]  We gotta go to a break.
[01:20:05.561 --> 01:20:07.123]  We're gonna be right back with Lionel.
[01:20:07.283 --> 01:20:07.724]  Stay with us.
[01:20:09.551 --> 01:20:16.278]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[01:20:16.639 --> 01:20:20.283]  It caught me totally by surprise, and it involves FEMA.
[01:20:20.623 --> 01:20:23.606]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[01:20:24.027 --> 01:20:29.132]  Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[01:20:29.713 --> 01:20:33.735]  Watch the viral video at FEMA3.com before it disappears again.
[01:20:34.075 --> 01:20:39.677]  But be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is, they must know something we don't.
[01:20:40.237 --> 01:20:50.242]  Go to FEMA3.com to see the number one item you should be hoarding and why supplies of this critical item are so low or even completely sold out at many stores across America.
[01:20:50.962 --> 01:20:51.842]  Don't miss out.
[01:20:52.182 --> 01:20:56.904]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in recent days.
[01:20:57.384 --> 01:21:02.646]  Go to FEMA3.com and discover the number one most critical item in a crisis.
[01:21:02.986 --> 01:21:06.287]  Watch the shocking video right now at FEMA3.com.
[01:21:06.628 --> 01:21:08.708]  Again, that's FEMA3.com.
[01:21:09.649 --> 01:21:12.330]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:15.871]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[01:21:17.085 --> 01:21:20.266]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[01:21:20.567 --> 01:21:25.669]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[01:21:26.009 --> 01:21:27.230]  How is this even possible?
[01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:34.813]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[01:21:35.033 --> 01:21:42.456]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[01:21:42.696 --> 01:21:45.898]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[01:21:46.178 --> 01:21:53.584]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[01:21:53.984 --> 01:21:56.706]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[01:21:57.146 --> 01:22:01.209]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[01:22:01.269 --> 01:22:01.950]  That's Greens75.com.

[01:22:08.467 --> 01:22:11.949]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:12.689 --> 01:22:13.209]  It's true.
[01:22:13.309 --> 01:22:17.251]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:17.471 --> 01:22:19.312]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:24.334]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:24.634 --> 01:22:37.252]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[01:24:14.654 --> 01:24:15.875]  I was a highway man.
[01:24:16.776 --> 01:24:18.158]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:18.218 --> 01:24:34.353]  I'm David Knight, your host, and joining me now is Lionel, Emmy award-winning TV news decoder and legal analyst, and Lionel was just in the middle of analyzing where he thinks the Supreme Court, and I agree with him, where the Supreme Court went off the rails this last year on their gay marriage ruling.
[01:24:34.393 --> 01:24:35.895]  I'll let you continue with that, Lionel.
[01:24:35.995 --> 01:24:38.658]  I know you were right in the middle of that as we had to go to a break.
[01:24:38.678 --> 01:24:38.918]  Go ahead.
[01:24:39.477 --> 01:24:40.318]  Well, a couple of things here.
[01:24:40.518 --> 01:24:52.745]  You know, we talk about the Constitution, and I know a lot of people are Tenth Amendment fans, but I want to bring up, to your attention and your edification, perusal, and review, Article, excuse me, Amendment 9, the Ninth Amendment.
[01:24:52.865 --> 01:24:53.705]  Very, very simple.
[01:24:54.445 --> 01:25:05.732]  The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
[01:25:06.906 --> 01:25:12.289]  This is the only document that says, just because it ain't in here doesn't mean you don't have the right to do it.
[01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:20.133]  I have the right to a colored TV, but the reason for that is because I just do, not because of the Constitution.
[01:25:20.153 --> 01:25:26.176]  Now look, whether you like gay rights, guns, drugs, it's
[01:25:27.597 --> 01:25:28.499]  Immaterial to me.
[01:25:28.959 --> 01:25:35.870]  Doesn't matter to me whether I am absolutely against the death penalty for a host of reasons.
[01:25:36.712 --> 01:25:39.536]  I'm for a lot of things that you and I may not
[01:25:40.595 --> 01:25:41.236]  I agree with.
[01:25:41.396 --> 01:25:43.779]  There are things that I don't like.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:45.541]  I don't like.
[01:25:45.901 --> 01:25:47.423]  I don't like abortion.
[01:25:48.004 --> 01:25:48.765]  I don't like it.
[01:25:49.105 --> 01:25:54.251]  But I don't want to see a woman being told by the government, sorry, we're not interested in what you think.
[01:25:54.371 --> 01:25:56.013]  You have no say.
[01:25:56.514 --> 01:25:56.914]  Nothing.
[01:25:57.034 --> 01:25:59.878]  Even though I'm thinking, wait a minute, that's good in a way.
[01:26:01.019 --> 01:26:08.048]  The encroachment of the government means more to me than the dislike of the thing which I'm theoretically in favor of.
[01:26:08.389 --> 01:26:12.054]  So whether you like Obama or not, it doesn't matter.
[01:26:12.074 --> 01:26:13.896]  David, there are people I know...
[01:26:15.054 --> 01:26:15.654]  Two sides.
[01:26:16.254 --> 01:26:20.315]  One, I know people who are adamantly against guns.
[01:26:20.755 --> 01:26:25.416]  They say things like we ought to take every gun there is and take it off the street.
[01:26:25.956 --> 01:26:27.117]  How do you expect to do that?
[01:26:27.297 --> 01:26:32.198]  I don't know, but we just do it because I hate guns and I hate gun people.
[01:26:32.698 --> 01:26:34.478]  And then I see this other group.
[01:26:34.979 --> 01:26:36.759]  This is the faux conservative.
[01:26:37.119 --> 01:26:42.401]  This is the person who claims who doesn't know, you know, a breech loader from a hole in the ground.
[01:26:42.681 --> 01:26:53.045]  Who doesn't really care about guns, but takes the position of being pro-gun because he or she wants to be the prototypical quintessential archetypal conservative.
[01:26:53.185 --> 01:26:54.886]  They're just as phony as the others!
[01:26:55.586 --> 01:26:56.967]  This has nothing to do with it.
[01:26:57.207 --> 01:27:01.491]  The Constitution has nothing to do with your likes or dislikes.
[01:27:01.611 --> 01:27:07.035]  And by the way, you may not like gay people, black people, white people, it doesn't matter!
[01:27:07.455 --> 01:27:11.058]  Your freedom remains for you to like or dislike.
[01:27:11.458 --> 01:27:18.124]  But the certainty of our rights transcend our individual likes and dislikes.
[01:27:18.644 --> 01:27:21.645]  So when you try to tell somebody, why should you care about guns?
[01:27:21.765 --> 01:27:24.026]  Because it's in the Constitution!
[01:27:24.546 --> 01:27:25.947]  The Second Amendment!
[01:27:26.367 --> 01:27:28.788]  And people can parse all they want.
[01:27:29.288 --> 01:27:30.609]  Did they mean the militia?
[01:27:31.209 --> 01:27:34.350]  Did the Heller case speak to this?
[01:27:35.171 --> 01:27:45.055]  Look, all I know is that it was important, as was the Third Amendment, for our drafters, our constitutional forebears, there was a reason for this!
[01:27:45.751 --> 01:27:57.914]  Yes, exactly, and it kind of comes down to the issue of whether or not it's a privilege that is granted by the Constitution, or whether or not the Constitution is recognizing fundamental rights that we have as human beings, and that's clearly the case.
[01:27:58.334 --> 01:28:01.815]  That's what you're talking about when you're talking about the Ninth Amendment and the Tenth Amendment.
[01:28:02.096 --> 01:28:03.316]  That's clearly the case.
[01:28:03.376 --> 01:28:10.858]  It's what many people have called negative rights, saying the government cannot encroach on you in these certain areas, and we're going to make sure that, you know, we're not
[01:28:11.038 --> 01:28:14.381]  We're not saying, as you point out, that if we don't mention it, you can take it.
[01:28:14.602 --> 01:28:24.011]  But we're saying that these particular things, like our freedom of speech, like our ability to keep and bear arms, those are so important that we're going to specifically say, hands off, leave that alone.
[01:28:24.451 --> 01:28:29.877]  And of course, you know, the difference that we have with abortion is that we look at that as a taking of life.
[01:28:30.017 --> 01:28:32.660]  And so that's where the discrepancy comes in with that.
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:32.980]  But it is!
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:33.580]  That is, yeah.
[01:28:34.241 --> 01:28:34.881]  But it is!
[01:28:36.041 --> 01:28:52.605]  And this may be absolutely positively incongruous, but I don't know about you, but a fetus, an embryo, it's not a duck, it's a human being, and it may not be completely formed, but an infant isn't a fully formed adult either.
[01:28:52.985 --> 01:28:55.205]  That's not even the basis for this.
[01:28:55.645 --> 01:28:58.446]  Sometimes there are some very, very hard issues.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:03.506]  I don't know how to make this any clearer.
[01:29:03.526 --> 01:29:07.432]  You know, we have become, David, so personal.
[01:29:07.913 --> 01:29:12.661]  I've got friends of mine who talk about global warming.
[01:29:13.446 --> 01:29:16.247]  I declare global warming!
[01:29:16.807 --> 01:29:23.428]  Aren't you worried about that little polar bear hanging on to the little ice cube that was an iceberg?
[01:29:23.909 --> 01:29:25.349]  What about the polar bear?
[01:29:25.989 --> 01:29:30.810]  And I'm thinking to myself, boy, you, I mean, you just fell hook line and sinker for this stuff.
[01:29:31.090 --> 01:29:33.271]  What about the Malthusian aspects of it?
[01:29:33.311 --> 01:29:34.271]  The anti-industrial?
[01:29:34.291 --> 01:29:35.651]  What about the carbon taxing?
[01:29:35.751 --> 01:29:36.772]  It's a ruse!
[01:29:37.132 --> 01:29:37.632]  Wake up!
[01:29:37.972 --> 01:29:38.192]  Yes.
[01:29:38.332 --> 01:29:40.933]  It's all about global governance, isn't it, Lionel?
[01:29:40.953 --> 01:29:44.335]  And of course, we're out of time, but that's where we're headed.
[01:29:44.415 --> 01:29:51.397]  That's what they're using this for, is a beard to consolidate power, even from the Washington level to the international level.
[01:29:51.617 --> 01:29:52.618]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:29:52.878 --> 01:29:53.378]  That's Lionel.
[01:29:53.398 --> 01:29:55.239]  You can find him at LionelMedia.com.
[01:29:55.279 --> 01:29:57.220]  His Twitter handle is LionelMedia.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:58.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:29:59.461]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.961 --> 01:30:01.561]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.482 --> 01:30:05.163]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.224 --> 01:30:18.771]  At least 20 armed militia members, including three members of the Bundy family, have seized control of a federal building at the Milor National Wildlife Refuge about 50 miles southeast of Burns, Oregon.
[01:30:19.071 --> 01:30:23.314]  The occupation is in response to the persecution of two Oregon ranchers, Dwight Hammond Jr.
[01:30:23.414 --> 01:30:24.175]  and Stephen Hammond.
[01:30:24.295 --> 01:30:27.597]  who were convicted of a federal arson charge under an anti-terrorism law.
[01:30:27.817 --> 01:30:33.281]  In 2006, the Hammonds started a controlled burn to stop the spread of a lightning storm fire which threatened their ranch.
[01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:43.629]  The backfire saved their home and much of their property, but five years later, the federal government, particularly the Bureau of Land Management, claimed the Hammonds were terrorists who started the fire to damage federally controlled land.
[01:30:43.769 --> 01:30:49.933]  The feds sent Dwight and Stephen to prison and are threatening to take their 12,000 acre property if they do not pay the BLM $200,000.
[01:30:51.494 --> 01:30:55.660]  InfoWars reporter Joe Biggs and other crew members will be on the scene giving live updates.
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:31:02.308]  You can also follow Alex Jones on Facebook and the Alex Jones channel on YouTube for the latest developments on the situation.

[01:31:09.057 --> 01:31:11.220]  It has happened.
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.883]  2015 has passed into history, into lore.
[01:31:14.303 --> 01:31:17.066]  But now, 2016 has been born.

[01:31:22.673 --> 01:31:23.494]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[01:31:23.854 --> 01:31:36.578]  That's a little too epic, that Hollywood action-adventure-science-fiction voice I'm using, but quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when your body actually gets the real, natural nutrients it needs.

[01:33:19.170 --> 01:33:21.332]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:33:21.832 --> 01:33:24.294]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:24.814 --> 01:33:27.196]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.758 --> 01:33:30.979]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:31.019 --> 01:33:31.520]  I'm David Knight.
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:37.044]  Your host will be joining our reporters in Oregon, hopefully in the next hour.
[01:33:37.064 --> 01:33:40.386]  They're on their way to the site to give us some eyes on the ground.
[01:33:41.247 --> 01:33:43.169]  Now, what do we have to look forward to in the new year?
[01:33:43.229 --> 01:33:48.473]  There's a lot of new and crazy regulations that are already taking effect this year.
[01:33:49.289 --> 01:33:53.251]  And a study says that 2015 was a record year for federal regulations.
[01:33:53.311 --> 01:33:57.012]  Now they're talking about how there were 81,611 pages.
[01:33:57.612 --> 01:33:59.913]  That's huge, as Donald Trump would say.
[01:34:00.293 --> 01:34:05.375]  It's something that we cannot do on a year-to-year basis, and that's what they are doing on a yearly basis.
[01:34:05.675 --> 01:34:09.377]  They're doing 70,000 to 80,000 pages of new regulations each year.
[01:34:09.457 --> 01:34:14.039]  I remember about 10 years ago there was a congressional candidate in North Carolina
[01:34:14.827 --> 01:34:21.872]  Who said, we're going to feed the IRS code into a paper shredder to tell people we want to get rid of the income tax.
[01:34:22.012 --> 01:34:27.616]  And he couldn't even get an exact figure from anybody at the IRS in terms of how many pages it was.
[01:34:27.696 --> 01:34:28.456]  They really didn't know.
[01:34:29.697 --> 01:34:31.438]  Finally he got an estimate of around 60,000.
[01:34:31.558 --> 01:34:33.300]  So he got this stack.
[01:34:34.233 --> 01:34:44.520]  of phone books and fed them into a wood chipper and I mean it was a huge stack of phone books but they're adding 81,000 pages into the register just this year now that's just
[01:34:45.419 --> 01:34:47.780]  Rules without representation.
[01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:49.821]  Rules by the federal bureaucracies.
[01:34:49.861 --> 01:34:55.604]  Now, the big hitters in this, of course, are the EPA, the FCC, others like that.
[01:34:56.184 --> 01:34:59.366]  But it's a lot of little regulations at the local level, too.
[01:34:59.386 --> 01:35:00.647]  Look at what's happening in New York.
[01:35:00.667 --> 01:35:08.251]  You can be fined $250,000, a quarter of a million dollars, if you offend a transgender woman in New York City.
[01:35:08.291 --> 01:35:10.452]  This is an article we had on Infowars.com, December 29th.
[01:35:11.192 --> 01:35:15.653]  From Michael Schneider, they say, brand new rules just issued by the New York City Commissioner on Human Rights.
[01:35:16.033 --> 01:35:22.315]  You could potentially be fined $250,000 if you purposely offend someone like Bruce Jender.
[01:35:22.695 --> 01:35:22.995]  Okay?
[01:35:23.315 --> 01:35:26.236]  You do that, then they basically will hit you with a quarter million dollar fine.
[01:35:26.276 --> 01:35:39.739]  In Massachusetts, a judge, because that's where a lot of our rules and regulations are coming from, not from our elected representatives, a judge says, a Roman Catholic school in Massachusetts has been ordered by a Superior Court judge to hire homosexuals for non-teaching positions.
[01:35:40.539 --> 01:35:43.683]  Again, this is a private religious school.
[01:35:44.384 --> 01:35:53.894]  When Jefferson wrote about a wall of separation, he was talking about a wall that separated and protected religious beliefs from government intrusion.
[01:35:53.934 --> 01:35:55.576]  It was some people who were
[01:35:56.557 --> 01:36:08.851]  Baptists in Connecticut, and they were concerned because as part of the election campaign, John Adams had been telling everybody that Thomas Jefferson was this atheist who was going to destroy their Bibles and throw them into jail, and so they wrote him a letter.
[01:36:08.871 --> 01:36:14.937]  He goes, no, there is a wall of separation with the First Amendment that protects you from the federal government.
[01:36:14.997 --> 01:36:16.959]  Now that wall has turned around the other way.
[01:36:16.999 --> 01:36:18.020]  That's why we need to be careful.
[01:36:18.681 --> 01:36:20.545]  about saying that walls are solution.
[01:36:20.585 --> 01:36:21.848]  Walls on the border are the solution.
[01:36:22.268 --> 01:36:27.599]  Walls that tend to be built to keep other people out by the government usually wind up being your prison.
[01:36:28.513 --> 01:36:33.097]  As George Washington said, when people said, well, you talk about freedom in the United States, aren't the British people free?
[01:36:33.117 --> 01:36:33.578]  And he says, yeah.
[01:36:34.118 --> 01:36:37.301]  They walk about freely, but between high walls.
[01:36:37.742 --> 01:36:40.765]  And those walls get closer and narrower all the time.
[01:36:41.245 --> 01:36:44.148]  Look at this regulation that was just pronounced by the FAA.
[01:36:44.188 --> 01:36:46.030]  We've talked about this many times on Infowars.
[01:36:46.050 --> 01:36:49.333]  It became effective on the 21st, that if you get a drone,
[01:36:49.873 --> 01:36:53.396]  You have to register it with the federal government if it's a half pound or more.
[01:36:53.836 --> 01:37:00.542]  And so they've been inundated with so many applications from people who don't want to challenge the government.
[01:37:00.582 --> 01:37:03.845]  They're concerned because the government comes in, again, it's civil action.
[01:37:04.185 --> 01:37:09.829]  Just like civil asset forfeiture, where they don't charge you with a crime, they don't wait until they find you guilty, they just take your property.
[01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:12.552]  The FAA says, we've got a new rule we're going to put out here.
[01:37:13.172 --> 01:37:20.369]  And we're going to say that if you don't do this and that to register your little toy plane, then we're going to come after you with a $27,500 fine.
[01:37:23.817 --> 01:37:24.317]  Just like that.
[01:37:24.678 --> 01:37:25.158]  Just like that.
[01:37:25.758 --> 01:37:31.082]  And so people who don't want to contest that say, well, you know, we're going to comply with it.
[01:37:31.122 --> 01:37:32.463]  They crashed the system.
[01:37:32.503 --> 01:37:33.684]  There was so much stuff there.
[01:37:34.464 --> 01:37:37.346]  And then, of course, we've got Real ID, which is on its way.
[01:37:37.527 --> 01:37:43.511]  And Real ID is going to be used by the TSA to keep people from flying, perhaps.
[01:37:44.111 --> 01:37:55.299]  They say, this is an article from the 10th Amendment Center, they say, the TSA has threatened to stop accepting driver's licenses from five states, Illinois, Missouri, Minnesota, New Mexico, and Washington State this year.
[01:37:55.799 --> 01:38:01.483]  These five states remain non-compliant with the requirements of the Real ID Act and they don't have pending waiver extensions.
[01:38:01.523 --> 01:38:05.105]  Now, there's about half of the states, it goes through the article, I think it's like 28 states,
[01:38:06.526 --> 01:38:19.056]  That have not complied with real ID and there's some real concerns about privacy, about control by the government, of our movements, of our not having to have a national ID in order to buy and sell and move around.
[01:38:19.977 --> 01:38:29.226]  But here we've got the TSA moving from their so-called protective mode, okay, they're supposed to be protecting us at the airports, now they're moving into being a strong-arming bully.
[01:38:29.966 --> 01:38:31.668]  That's the way these things always go.
[01:38:31.708 --> 01:38:41.918]  He points out in the 10th Amendment, Senator says, constitutionally the federal government lacks any authority to create a national ID, but the feds won't let something like constitutional limitations stop them from doing what they want.
[01:38:42.378 --> 01:38:49.623]  They say 10 years after passage of this REAL ID law, half of the states, more than half the states, have not complied with REAL ID.
[01:38:49.683 --> 01:39:01.551]  So, so far the DHS, Homeland Security, has not announced a schedule for enforcement at the airport, but once it does, it will give a 120 day notice before they actually stop accepting IDs at checkpoints.
[01:39:01.671 --> 01:39:11.818]  And DHS said, as we continue the phased in enforcement of REAL ID Act, the consequences of continued non-compliance will grow with each milestone.
[01:39:12.578 --> 01:39:14.600]  That's the way tyranny grows.
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:18.322]  That's why it says infringement in the Second Amendment.
[01:39:18.983 --> 01:39:22.045]  They do it by a process of gradual infringement.
[01:39:22.325 --> 01:39:24.146]  And that's what the TSA is doing right now.
[01:39:24.647 --> 01:39:27.869]  They're not just a bunch of bumbling idiots.
[01:39:27.989 --> 01:39:30.871]  No, they're going to be used by Homeland Security as well.
[01:39:31.311 --> 01:39:33.173]  The federal strategy, he says here, is pretty clear.
[01:39:33.253 --> 01:39:34.494]  Crack down on five states.
[01:39:35.114 --> 01:39:37.656]  Then intimidate the others into falling in line.
[01:39:37.716 --> 01:39:47.042]  By limiting its initial action to just a few states, the feds can keep the public outcry down to a dull roar, shift the blame onto those five state governments.
[01:39:47.162 --> 01:39:49.944]  It is a classic bullying tactic.
[01:39:50.385 --> 01:39:51.065]  Exactly right.
[01:39:51.465 --> 01:39:55.828]  Rough up a few kids, all the rest of them into falling into line.
[01:39:55.848 --> 01:39:58.330]  Now that's on the 10th Amendment Center.
[01:39:58.390 --> 01:40:01.592]  And the Missouri lawmakers have spoke up about this.
[01:40:01.793 --> 01:40:03.574]  Of course this is one of the states where
[01:40:04.648 --> 01:40:06.230]  They did not comply with it.
[01:40:06.611 --> 01:40:19.526]  Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder released an online statement saying the real-world implication of nationalized ID system with a biometric photo data that allows for long-distance ID and tracking of residents is disturbing.
[01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:21.508]  Yeah, to say the least.
[01:40:21.949 --> 01:40:23.230]  But that's our TSA.
[01:40:24.153 --> 01:40:25.834]  We got a special report from Alex Jones.
[01:40:25.874 --> 01:40:27.214]  The TSA is a joke.
[01:40:27.234 --> 01:40:27.594]  You know what?
[01:40:27.634 --> 01:40:28.855]  The joke is on you.
[01:40:29.455 --> 01:40:30.235]  The joke is on you.
[01:40:30.255 --> 01:40:31.996]  The joke has been in your pants.
[01:40:32.316 --> 01:40:33.696]  And now they're going farther.
[01:40:34.017 --> 01:40:36.517]  They're going to use this to control your movement.
[01:40:36.557 --> 01:40:37.758]  Here's Alex Jones' report.
[01:40:39.038 --> 01:40:44.040]  Alex Jones here on this Sunday, what is the third day of January 2016.
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:51.703]  I'm getting on an airplane to fly out to Phoenix, Arizona to interview
[01:40:52.945 --> 01:40:56.047]  One of the most influential leaders in America today.
[01:40:57.427 --> 01:40:59.088]  I will announce who that leader is tomorrow.
[01:41:00.549 --> 01:41:07.112]  And I'm going to interview that leader, first and foremost, to have dialogue so that we don't have civil war in this country.
[01:41:09.133 --> 01:41:14.856]  Now, that said, there are groups and organizations that have had an armed takeover of a federal building in Oregon right now.
[01:41:15.296 --> 01:41:21.219]  We're also dispatching reporters to cover that, to try to stop a civil war as well, from the other side of the spectrum.
[01:41:22.756 --> 01:41:24.737]  Because the globalists want chaos.
[01:41:25.557 --> 01:41:38.062]  Now, meanwhile, CBS News reported two weeks ago that 150 people from Mexico flew in to JFK in New York and were allowed to just come in without even showing their passports and customs.
[01:41:39.522 --> 01:41:45.724]  But then today, I watched people pulled out of line to be searched and their bags torn apart.
[01:41:46.124 --> 01:41:46.845]  We opted out.
[01:41:47.285 --> 01:41:50.006]  The TSA's claiming they're getting rid of the opting out or have the right to.
[01:41:51.235 --> 01:41:54.658]  And myself, Rob Dew, and Josh Owens, everybody traveling with us, all got searched.
[01:41:55.738 --> 01:41:56.459]  And they took their time.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:00.222]  Total violation of the Fourth Amendment, totally training us to be slaves.
[01:42:00.242 --> 01:42:10.550]  I'm not against the TSA themselves, except what they're doing is a joke, because the border is wide open, the government ships the people in, the Border Patrol admits they complete the smuggling process, and then here we are.
[01:42:11.772 --> 01:42:13.353]  With ISIS being brought into the country.
[01:42:13.874 --> 01:42:16.376]  Here we are with all these Syrian refugees from a war-torn area.
[01:42:16.396 --> 01:42:17.637]  A bunch of them fighters being brought in.
[01:42:17.937 --> 01:42:20.519]  All these attacks happening in Europe, San Bernardino.
[01:42:21.340 --> 01:42:24.362]  And they sit there so seriously, tearing through everyone's luggage.
[01:42:24.422 --> 01:42:28.605]  Oh my God, this is a 5-ounce bottle of cream, not a 4-ounce or, you know.
[01:42:29.246 --> 01:42:30.286]  It's ridiculous.
[01:42:31.447 --> 01:42:33.489]  But the system wants to break the American people.
[01:42:33.729 --> 01:42:34.789]  They want to dog train us.
[01:42:35.670 --> 01:42:36.711]  And train us, we have no rights.
[01:42:36.731 --> 01:42:38.352]  Let's blow up their face.
[01:42:38.972 --> 01:42:41.353]  Now, to show you the media control, let me show you this.
[01:42:42.134 --> 01:42:45.896]  I covered this on the radio last week.
[01:42:46.937 --> 01:42:48.758]  This is the weekend issue of USA Today.
[01:42:50.819 --> 01:42:53.561]  The December 31st issue, the last big one.
[01:42:53.641 --> 01:42:54.281]  I covered this.
[01:42:55.956 --> 01:42:56.757]  Before the year ended.
[01:42:57.078 --> 01:42:59.140]  In fact, on the 31st when I was doing the radio.
[01:42:59.801 --> 01:43:01.003]  Here it is this weekend still being sold.
[01:43:01.463 --> 01:43:09.233]  The headline of the same article written by Rick Hampson was TV faces its mortality in politics.
[01:43:09.954 --> 01:43:10.895]  It means it's death.
[01:43:11.916 --> 01:43:14.700]  But here it's TV faces threat to its throne in politics.
[01:43:17.389 --> 01:43:24.832]  You see, because they know this is a non-digital audience that reads this, they act like TV's in a little bit of trouble to their Dumbo audience.
[01:43:25.692 --> 01:43:28.293]  But, to the cyber audience, they admit it's basically dead.
[01:43:29.233 --> 01:43:34.075]  So that shows you the level of manipulation and the level of control that we're dealing with here.
[01:43:35.333 --> 01:43:37.595]  Our average Facebook mention is just like a half million viewers.
[01:43:37.615 --> 01:43:40.318]  How are they gonna compete with that when the top CNN show doesn't even get that?
[01:43:40.338 --> 01:43:43.160]  But CNN is, again, it's not just that we're alternative.
[01:43:43.801 --> 01:43:44.942]  It's that we're just real.
[01:43:45.963 --> 01:43:46.964]  We cover real info.
[01:43:47.004 --> 01:43:48.005]  We don't play games.
[01:43:49.026 --> 01:43:51.928]  We're just showing people the- May I have your attention please?
[01:43:53.410 --> 01:43:56.633]  For your safety, do you- is there anybody, any bags or anything?
[01:43:56.773 --> 01:43:57.934]  No, there's an open border, bitch!
[01:43:59.162 --> 01:44:01.583]  There's goddamn Al-Qaeda people being shipped in, you whore.
[01:44:02.524 --> 01:44:04.164]  You fucking want me to tell you if I saw something?
[01:44:04.184 --> 01:44:05.025]  Yeah, I saw something.
[01:44:05.425 --> 01:44:06.966]  I saw total tyranny being brought in.
[01:44:07.606 --> 01:44:10.127]  I saw foreign threats being used to take my freedoms.
[01:44:10.147 --> 01:44:12.748]  Here, let's listen to her.
[01:44:12.768 --> 01:44:13.348]  Now it's in Spanish.
[01:44:13.368 --> 01:44:14.529]  Do you see anything suspicious?
[01:44:14.549 --> 01:44:14.889]  Yeah.
[01:44:15.409 --> 01:44:17.950]  I got a hijacked government out of control, working with terrorists.
[01:44:18.751 --> 01:44:20.071]  And then using them to take my freedoms.
[01:44:20.131 --> 01:44:20.712]  I'm tired of it.
[01:44:21.592 --> 01:44:23.393]  And then I'm not blaming these poor TSA people.
[01:44:23.413 --> 01:44:24.253]  Half of them were listeners.
[01:44:24.874 --> 01:44:25.794]  Dude, you opted out.
[01:44:25.814 --> 01:44:25.934]  Yeah.
[01:44:26.634 --> 01:44:27.495]  Let's talk to Drew real quick.
[01:44:27.515 --> 01:44:27.695]  Alright.
[01:44:28.584 --> 01:44:31.606]  Yeah, um, the guy was, uh, he was like, sorry, I gotta do this.
[01:44:32.707 --> 01:44:33.388]  Going through everything.
[01:44:33.408 --> 01:44:35.809]  Seemed like a real nice guy, but... They do it because they save the images.
[01:44:36.110 --> 01:44:36.370]  Oh, yeah.
[01:44:36.690 --> 01:44:36.870]  Yeah.
[01:44:36.990 --> 01:44:38.712]  Those naked body scanners violate child porn laws.
[01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:39.940]  Exactly.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:43.762]  And of course, in response to doing that, they put all the kids through the metal detector.
[01:44:44.102 --> 01:44:47.563]  I tried to walk through the metal detector after somebody said, oh no, you've got to go through the scanner.
[01:44:48.204 --> 01:44:49.204]  I said, no, opt out.
[01:44:49.884 --> 01:44:51.285]  And I was waiting for it to say, you can't opt out.
[01:44:51.305 --> 01:44:52.545]  And I'm going to say, yes, I can.
[01:44:52.865 --> 01:44:53.226]  I can opt out.
[01:44:53.246 --> 01:44:56.187]  But they let people that sign up beforehand go through, even though they know full well that you are.
[01:44:56.467 --> 01:44:56.687]  Exactly.
[01:44:56.707 --> 01:45:00.308]  But down the road, even though you've signed up to be a slave, they'll still opt you in.
[01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:01.789]  He's training you to get into it.
[01:45:01.909 --> 01:45:05.850]  So I got the full court press and then of course he goes up into your thigh.
[01:45:05.870 --> 01:45:08.931]  He said I'm going to go all the way up to where your legs meet your torso.
[01:45:09.411 --> 01:45:14.652]  Hit that a couple times of course to make sure he does a thorough body cavity search.
[01:45:14.692 --> 01:45:17.953]  Of course they didn't do that but you know it's just the security theater.
[01:45:17.973 --> 01:45:19.093]  It's all part of the security theater.
[01:45:23.277 --> 01:45:23.798]  You opted out.
[01:45:24.098 --> 01:45:24.799]  Oh yeah.
[01:45:25.019 --> 01:45:27.542]  I think the guy enjoyed it a little bit more than he should have.
[01:45:28.003 --> 01:45:32.749]  This is actually the first time I've opted out where he got everything and he went front, back, everywhere.
[01:45:33.249 --> 01:45:35.192]  So I think it's getting a little bit more ridiculous than it should be.
[01:45:36.327 --> 01:45:37.107]  But the border's open.
[01:45:37.548 --> 01:45:38.088]  Oh, exactly.
[01:45:38.128 --> 01:45:39.448]  We've flown over the Arizona border.
[01:45:39.468 --> 01:45:44.010]  We've flown over the entire, from the entire Mexico border, U.S.-Mexico border.
[01:45:44.210 --> 01:45:45.190]  It's open everywhere.
[01:45:45.731 --> 01:45:47.811]  And then they ship the illegals in and don't even search them.
[01:45:47.911 --> 01:45:48.352]  Absolutely.
[01:45:48.572 --> 01:45:49.512]  I mean, security theater.
[01:45:49.652 --> 01:45:51.333]  Are you excited about the big interview we got coming up?
[01:45:51.513 --> 01:45:51.673]  I am.
[01:45:51.693 --> 01:45:52.613]  It's going to be very interesting.
[01:45:52.633 --> 01:45:53.654]  People need to stay tuned.
[01:45:53.994 --> 01:45:54.734]  It's going to be a big deal.
[01:45:55.234 --> 01:46:00.238]  Listen to this, it's announcing, it's announcing, be paranoid, watch out, terrorists are everywhere right now on the loudspeaker.
[01:46:00.638 --> 01:46:04.501]  But the border's open, they ship people in from Mexico and don't even check their passports.
[01:46:04.541 --> 01:46:05.562]  That's mainstream news.
[01:46:05.962 --> 01:46:08.264]  It's all a fraud, they ship in refugees, aren't even vetted.
[01:46:08.624 --> 01:46:09.385]  All of it's a fraud.
[01:46:09.405 --> 01:46:15.189]  All of it's to terrorize you into submission and just groveling to tyranny while everything's wide open.
[01:46:15.649 --> 01:46:17.651]  This is how America and its soul is broken.
[01:46:18.091 --> 01:46:21.854]  This is how people are made to lose their will and absolutely turn into slaves.
[01:46:21.914 --> 01:46:22.534]  I mean, just look at it.
[01:46:22.815 --> 01:46:24.076]  There you've got the sheeple over here.
[01:46:24.896 --> 01:46:27.179]  This guy believes he's fighting for America right here.
[01:46:27.219 --> 01:46:30.722]  And the whole time, the globalists have already captured America and run the terrorists.
[01:46:30.802 --> 01:46:31.683]  All right.
[01:46:31.723 --> 01:46:34.026]  We're going to be covering... Look at this TSA guy.
[01:46:36.710 --> 01:46:39.112]  I mean, it is absolutely ridiculous.
[01:46:40.293 --> 01:46:42.995]  Anyways, we're here to expose the hypocrisy of the joke that it is.
[01:46:43.355 --> 01:46:46.398]  Infowars.com forward slash show, the free feed.
[01:46:46.418 --> 01:46:47.198]  Send it out to everybody.
[01:46:47.459 --> 01:46:49.140]  David Knight's live right now on the radio.
[01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:50.821]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:46:51.422 --> 01:46:53.484]  Covering serious events in Oregon.
[01:46:53.564 --> 01:46:55.545]  Armed takeover of a federal facility and more.
[01:46:55.925 --> 01:46:57.467]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:46:59.227 --> 01:47:06.155]  Okay, that's Alex Jones and of course the TSA is going to be part of the strategy to roll out a national ID card.
[01:47:06.175 --> 01:47:08.117]  That's how they're going to bully you into doing that.
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:12.781]  And of course we've got our government on many different levels working to shut down our transportation.
[01:47:12.801 --> 01:47:16.762]  I want to talk about what they're doing with no refusal blood draws.
[01:47:16.802 --> 01:47:20.663]  They want to move this to a year-round position here in Austin.
[01:47:21.164 --> 01:47:31.006]  And we've got a massive new partnership announced today between General Motors and Lyft in terms of taking over control of your private movement.
[01:47:31.026 --> 01:47:32.567]  You know, I've got a self-driving car right now.
[01:47:32.587 --> 01:47:35.268]  I hate to see these things called a self-driving car.
[01:47:35.348 --> 01:47:36.488]  I drive myself right now.
[01:47:37.088 --> 01:47:39.210]  That's what automobile means.
[01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:48.358]  It means I drive myself when and where I want, without being tracked, without being controlled, without being stopped, without being taxed by the government.
[01:47:48.398 --> 01:47:49.459]  But they're going to stop all that.
[01:47:49.479 --> 01:47:56.446]  They're going to tax you by mile, they're going to do everything else they can to force you away from private ownership of vehicles.
[01:47:57.046 --> 01:48:00.668]  Before we get to those stories, I want to let you know about the specials that we have at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:48:00.688 --> 01:48:04.970]  We've got 15% off across the board at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:08.651]  This week, only with promo code GIFT15.
[01:48:08.711 --> 01:48:09.832]  This is an end-of-the-year special.
[01:48:09.852 --> 01:48:11.272]  They've extended it one more week.
[01:48:11.753 --> 01:48:15.294]  Right now, one of the specials we have is a resolution pack.
[01:48:15.434 --> 01:48:23.278]  You get a discount off of Survival Shield X2, our Deep Cleanse formula, and our Secret 12 Vitamin B12 liquid supplement.
[01:48:23.758 --> 01:48:30.343]  Also, you can get things like the Hillary for Prison t-shirt 15% off before it sells out at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:48:30.383 --> 01:48:33.405]  Again, just use the promo code GIFT15 or 2016.
[01:48:34.406 --> 01:48:35.167]  Both of those will work.
[01:48:35.527 --> 01:48:47.016]  And you know, I just talked to them and amazingly enough, the InfoWars solar power base station supply is available at 15% off on the website as well.
[01:48:47.496 --> 01:48:48.437]  This is our new
[01:48:50.018 --> 01:48:52.081]  Affordable, high-powered solar generator.
[01:48:52.242 --> 01:48:53.603]  It's one of the best on the market.
[01:48:53.724 --> 01:48:57.549]  And the thing that separates these different generators is the battery technology.
[01:48:57.589 --> 01:49:00.433]  And this has a lithium iron phosphate battery.
[01:49:00.453 --> 01:49:03.017]  It'll last up to eight times longer than your typical unit.
[01:49:03.438 --> 01:49:04.700]  So this has a solar collector.
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:06.682]  It has a battery for storage.
[01:49:06.802 --> 01:49:09.586]  It has an inverter that's going to give you your AC power out.
[01:49:09.666 --> 01:49:15.353]  It has 1500 watts of continuous power, 3000 watts of peak power for any emergency.
[01:49:15.654 --> 01:49:20.259]  And the amazing thing is, you can get it, like everything else at our store right now, 15% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:49:23.953 --> 01:49:26.977]  Now going back to what we're looking at, we just had an article and I talked about it yesterday.
[01:49:26.997 --> 01:49:32.924]  It ended yesterday in Austin, the no refusal blood draw.
[01:49:33.004 --> 01:49:36.228]  If they accuse you of being a drunk driver, they can draw your blood.
[01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:37.530]  Just like vampires.
[01:49:38.188 --> 01:49:46.555]  But of course, Don Salazar came to me and said, you know, I reported back in October that Austin is pushing to get this done year-round.
[01:49:46.876 --> 01:49:51.460]  They just need to have more funding so they can hire more police, more technicians.
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:54.002]  You know, because that's the way you grow your little empire.
[01:49:54.022 --> 01:49:56.824]  And truly, it is one of the most
[01:49:57.825 --> 01:49:59.385]  Galling things I have ever seen.
[01:49:59.565 --> 01:50:04.186]  People who have their blood drawn and they don't have any alcohol level.
[01:50:04.226 --> 01:50:10.648]  I mean, the fact that you would have a no refusal blood draw, it kind of sounds like they would inject you with things against your will too, doesn't it?
[01:50:11.368 --> 01:50:15.349]  See, when you are a slave, they don't care about your informed consent.
[01:50:15.889 --> 01:50:17.669]  They don't care about your due process.
[01:50:18.029 --> 01:50:21.330]  They don't care about your legal rights or you as an individual.
[01:50:21.650 --> 01:50:25.191]  They will inject into your arm whatever they wish, whenever they wish.
[01:50:26.141 --> 01:50:33.324]  Without your informed consent, and they will pull blood or anything else that they want out of your body without your informed consent.
[01:50:33.464 --> 01:50:34.004]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:50:34.024 --> 01:50:41.266]  Of course, we've had these things happen typically on a Fourth of July, Halloween, New Year's Eve, Labor Day, which they recently extended to the end of the summer.
[01:50:42.127 --> 01:50:46.448]  But of course, now they need to have it year-round, and they're going to have to staff up.
[01:50:46.568 --> 01:50:52.830]  So, dig down deep into your wallets, folks, and pay for your own oppression by these vampire cops.
[01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:54.091]  And it's not just here in Austin.
[01:50:54.511 --> 01:50:56.373]  The State Patrol is doing it in Tennessee.
[01:50:56.854 --> 01:50:59.096]  And they say, oh, it's just going to be for a short period of time.
[01:50:59.236 --> 01:51:01.819]  That's the way they take your freedom.
[01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:03.702]  Gradual infringement.
[01:51:04.162 --> 01:51:05.824]  That's the way they're coming after the guns as well.
[01:51:05.864 --> 01:51:07.386]  They do it on every front.
[01:51:07.406 --> 01:51:07.806]  Stay with us.
[01:51:08.086 --> 01:51:08.667]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:09.428 --> 01:51:10.668]  Are you looking to sell body armor?

[01:51:33.597 --> 01:51:34.237]  Come and take it.
[01:51:39.159 --> 01:51:41.800]  If survivalist housing has been in your plans, get ready.
[01:51:42.020 --> 01:51:45.842]  We're bringing our Timberline Range Camps to you February 6th through 14th.
[01:51:46.082 --> 01:51:48.763]  The Great American Outdoor Show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

[01:52:08.917 --> 01:52:12.620]  Did you know that home break-ins increase more than 100% during the holidays?
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.983]  It takes just 10 seconds for an intruder to kick in your door.
[01:52:16.263 --> 01:52:19.886]  But police response to a home alarm system is more than 20 minutes.
[01:52:20.246 --> 01:52:22.988]  And intruders are in and out of your home in 5 minutes.
[01:52:23.448 --> 01:52:27.511]  Thieves know that you're not home and have presence inside just waiting to be taken.
[01:52:27.952 --> 01:52:33.156]  And if you are home, how safe will you feel with an intruder lurking inside with your family?
[01:52:33.556 --> 01:52:37.499]  That's why police across the country are recommending you use door armor.
[01:52:37.839 --> 01:52:42.543]  Proven to withstand the force of a battering ram, door armor keeps intruders out.
[01:52:42.903 --> 01:52:47.647]  It's easy to install and barely visible, and your door armor is guaranteed for life.

[01:52:53.792 --> 01:52:57.855]  These savings are for a limited time and only available to GCN listeners.

[01:53:04.361 --> 01:53:07.065]  That's invasionstopper.com.
[01:53:09.107 --> 01:53:11.771]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[01:53:11.851 --> 01:53:15.335]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[01:53:16.542 --> 01:53:19.703]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[01:53:20.023 --> 01:53:25.105]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[01:53:25.465 --> 01:53:26.686]  How is this even possible?
[01:53:26.946 --> 01:53:34.268]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[01:53:34.488 --> 01:53:41.911]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[01:53:42.131 --> 01:53:45.332]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[01:53:45.612 --> 01:53:53.035]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[01:53:53.435 --> 01:53:56.137]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[01:53:56.597 --> 01:54:00.739]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[01:54:00.759 --> 01:54:01.399]  That's Greens75.com.
[01:54:01.419 --> 01:54:01.819]  Greens75.com.
[01:54:17.406 --> 01:54:18.727]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:18.787 --> 01:54:19.827]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[01:54:20.187 --> 01:54:29.391]  We're going to be going to our reporters in the next hour who are on the ground in Oregon at the site of this takeover of the wildlife refuge there.
[01:54:29.932 --> 01:54:34.173]  It's amazing to see these headlines and of course it plays right into Obama's agenda.
[01:54:34.193 --> 01:54:35.354]  That's what we're very concerned about.
[01:54:36.354 --> 01:54:39.756]  We see things like armed protesters, armed group.
[01:54:40.256 --> 01:54:44.258]  We see that they are highlighting what the sheriff said there.
[01:54:44.298 --> 01:54:46.799]  These people aim to overthrow the government.
[01:54:47.179 --> 01:54:48.299]  And on and on and on.
[01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:52.260]  I think they are snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:57.462]  This case here, and we've had several really good articles by Kurt Nemo.
[01:54:57.562 --> 01:55:04.223]  First of all, laying out what is constitutionally wrong with the government owning so much land out west.
[01:55:04.944 --> 01:55:10.365]  And we've also got an article today, and I'll go over some of that later on in the next hour.
[01:55:11.550 --> 01:55:21.092]  Going over the specifics of this case and showing how the government is trying to run ranchers off, deliberately trying to run them off the land so that they can make money off of this.
[01:55:21.132 --> 01:55:26.413]  There's a lot of money, a lot of mineral resources there that can be handed out to their crony friends.
[01:55:26.493 --> 01:55:38.636]  We've seen this happen in Arizona, for example, where Senator McCain took over an area that was set aside for a park, set aside for a memorial to the Apache Nation there.
[01:55:39.622 --> 01:55:51.631]  Taking over the Tonto National Forest and then turning it over to a multinational corporation so they can do a destructive, incredibly destructive mining process and get the copper out of there.
[01:55:51.671 --> 01:55:52.792]  We see this over and over again.
[01:55:52.812 --> 01:55:54.733]  I mean, this is a shell game.
[01:55:55.073 --> 01:56:01.118]  It's crony capitalism writ large, but it is also Agenda 21, trying to get us off the land.
[01:56:01.678 --> 01:56:11.784]  total control and of course part of that is we're just talking about the TSA forcing being used as a wedge to bully us into taking a national ID card.
[01:56:11.944 --> 01:56:12.805]  We also have
[01:56:14.266 --> 01:56:21.728]  All of the different automobile manufacturers as well as many in Silicon Valley working with the government to control transportation.
[01:56:22.008 --> 01:56:25.429]  This has always been the dream of the government to control our transportation.
[01:56:25.449 --> 01:56:32.112]  So now today we see that General Motors and Lyft have announced an agreement that GM is going to invest $500 million in Lyft.
[01:56:33.792 --> 01:56:42.818]  They're going to create a national network of self-driving cars, and they point out that like other car manufacturers, they're going to move past the old ways.
[01:56:42.959 --> 01:56:51.344]  As the new age of mobility dawns, this is Wired Magazine writing, selling one car to every person with the money to buy one is no longer viable.
[01:56:51.585 --> 01:56:53.306]  They just want to lower their marketing costs.
[01:56:53.786 --> 01:56:54.026]  Okay?
[01:56:54.547 --> 01:57:06.522]  You can get thousands of percent return if you just buy a few politicians instead of spending all this money on focus groups and television ads and all this kind of stuff to build something that people want.
[01:57:07.203 --> 01:57:09.385]  Because, you know, you're not going to have a stake in the future.
[01:57:10.126 --> 01:57:17.294]  The future, as they see it, is where a few multinational billionaires working with the government control and own everything.
[01:57:17.895 --> 01:57:18.756]  And that's where we're headed.
[01:57:19.137 --> 01:57:22.080]  So right now what you're seeing is these alliances that are building up.
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:25.064]  You've got GM aligning itself with Lyft.
[01:57:25.124 --> 01:57:25.905]  You've got Uber.
[01:57:26.914 --> 01:57:35.279]  Out there floating massive stock offerings, getting not a half a billion dollars, but getting, I think they're over 20 billion dollars that they've gotten off of Wall Street.
[01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:44.265]  And of course, it's, you know, we'll give you the control of the transportation grid, and you can make all the profits, and then you feed us all the information.
[01:57:44.285 --> 01:57:45.386]  Where's everybody going?
[01:57:46.046 --> 01:57:51.050]  If we don't like this person, we will shut them down just like we do right now with a no-fly list.
[01:57:51.450 --> 01:57:54.712]  And the automobile manufacturers are a little bit smarter about the way they're doing this
[01:57:54.872 --> 01:57:55.632]  Then Google is.
[01:57:55.672 --> 01:57:58.073]  Google wants to go, as they put it, with a moonshot.
[01:57:58.113 --> 01:58:06.556]  They want to make the leap all the way from people driving in the cars to people getting into a car that has no steering wheel, no brakes, and say, trust me, okay?
[01:58:06.816 --> 01:58:15.279]  And they've already got, I think it is four times the accident rate that human drivers have with their Google self-driving cars.
[01:58:16.079 --> 01:58:19.141]  And they're getting some restrictions put on them in the state of California.
[01:58:19.381 --> 01:58:21.943]  Now they're moving to Austin to try to put this through.
[01:58:21.983 --> 01:58:29.708]  But you have other traditional automobile manufacturers are doing this more gradually because that's the way you roll stuff out.
[01:58:29.828 --> 01:58:31.790]  That's been the theme of the day, I think.
[01:58:31.850 --> 01:58:34.591]  The incrementalism of gradual infringement.
[01:58:34.611 --> 01:58:41.836]  They say gradually we're going to get people to turn over control of their lives, control of their movements to the car.
[01:58:41.896 --> 01:58:45.639]  But you're really turning it over to the people who own and run those robots.
[01:58:46.039 --> 01:58:47.682]  The government and a few corporations.
[01:58:47.702 --> 01:58:48.323]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:49.726 --> 01:58:51.169]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:53.733]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:59.039 --> 01:59:07.863]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[01:59:08.063 --> 01:59:14.346]  And it's all possible because in the hustle and bustle of daily life, we forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[01:59:14.566 --> 01:59:16.107]  The numbers are staggering.
[01:59:16.247 --> 01:59:22.810]  In the past five years alone, $41 billion of consumer gift cards went completely unspent.
[01:59:22.970 --> 01:59:26.234]  That's $41 billion taken directly from our back pockets.
[01:59:26.515 --> 01:59:27.556]  Don't let them win.
[01:59:27.897 --> 01:59:37.370]  Instead, use your gift cards to help support the InfoWar and get 15% off when you use the promo code GIFTFIFTEEN at checkout at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:59:37.630 --> 01:59:40.554]  Many gift cards are universal and work just like credit cards.
[01:59:40.754 --> 01:59:50.156]  But don't worry, if yours doesn't, just to promote the concept of using the money on your gift cards, the discount goes to everybody that uses the promo code.
[01:59:50.276 --> 01:59:52.236]  That's promo code GIFT15.

[02:00:01.578 --> 02:00:04.199]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:22.879 --> 02:00:29.152]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting near a Y, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.148 --> 02:00:33.789]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:33.869 --> 02:00:34.530]  I'm David Knight.
[02:00:34.850 --> 02:00:37.272]  We're going to be talking to our reporters in Oregon this hour.
[02:00:37.773 --> 02:00:40.715]  Before we do, I want to cover some other news that is breaking.
[02:00:41.335 --> 02:00:45.499]  Up on the Drudge Report, there's an article saying, do not track, does not include, guess who?
[02:00:45.539 --> 02:00:49.202]  The big guys, Facebook, Google, Yahoo, and others like that.
[02:00:49.742 --> 02:00:58.929]  And of course, what the article points out is that, surprise, surprise, the do not track regulatory process that was coming out of the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission,
[02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:02.420]  Does not include the big guys.
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:03.361]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:01:03.381 --> 02:01:06.861]  You know, somebody said regulations are like a spider web.
[02:01:06.921 --> 02:01:10.782]  They catch the small gnats, but the big bumblebees go right through the web.
[02:01:11.362 --> 02:01:12.942]  And that's what we see all the time.
[02:01:13.722 --> 02:01:29.105]  Understand that in many cases, just like we see in small businesses and towns, many cases it's the existing restaurants that want more regulation, that want tighter rules, that want higher requirements for getting into business because they want to shut down their competition.
[02:01:29.701 --> 02:01:35.946]  They're already on the ladder to success and they want to shut off and cut off the lower rungs of that ladder.
[02:01:36.006 --> 02:01:49.216]  So you see that happening even in local business areas, but it certainly is there when you're talking about the big multinational corporations that have so much money and can buy so many politicians in just the right place.
[02:01:49.276 --> 02:01:54.920]  They point out the FTC relied on a group that was dominated by powerful internet companies to set up these regulations.
[02:01:55.301 --> 02:01:57.723]  Companies like Google, Facebook, Yahoo,
[02:01:58.263 --> 02:02:00.725]  His business depends on online advertising.
[02:02:00.765 --> 02:02:01.646]  Well, fine, they say.
[02:02:01.926 --> 02:02:09.453]  Incredibly, the same big players who hijack the process could make this one-sided policy a de facto global standard.
[02:02:10.603 --> 02:02:11.023]  Oh, really?
[02:02:11.604 --> 02:02:14.807]  What do you think the Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic partnerships are about?
[02:02:15.508 --> 02:02:20.773]  These are written by a few large corporations and their corporate lawyers.
[02:02:21.273 --> 02:02:27.339]  The elected representatives and the countries that were going to be signing on to this were not even allowed to see it.
[02:02:27.879 --> 02:02:28.160]  Okay?
[02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:31.102]  And now that it has been there, nobody is paying any attention to it.
[02:02:31.142 --> 02:02:32.404]  And of course, it is massive.
[02:02:32.644 --> 02:02:35.507]  It's four times the collected works of Shakespeare.
[02:02:36.147 --> 02:02:40.631]  I forget how many times it is larger than the Bible, three or four times larger than the Bible itself.
[02:02:40.871 --> 02:02:43.473]  But these big guys are writing the regulations, and guess what?
[02:02:44.332 --> 02:02:47.093]  They're going to make sure that only they own everything.
[02:02:47.153 --> 02:02:50.714]  We have infringements in these trade agreements.
[02:02:50.734 --> 02:02:51.754]  They're not really trade agreements.
[02:02:51.774 --> 02:02:53.314]  They're not even really about free trade.
[02:02:53.334 --> 02:03:01.357]  The Democrats and Republicans are pretending that this is a traditional debate as to whether or not we're going to have tariffs or whether or not we're going to have free trade.
[02:03:01.397 --> 02:03:02.237]  Who gets to benefit?
[02:03:02.297 --> 02:03:03.737]  Is this going to impact the unions?
[02:03:03.817 --> 02:03:07.098]  And so you've got people lining up with their traditional constituency.
[02:03:07.158 --> 02:03:11.819]  Democrats with the unions and Republicans saying, oh, we want to have free trade and open business.
[02:03:11.839 --> 02:03:13.040]  That's not what it's about, folks.
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:15.081]  It's not at all about free trade.
[02:03:15.621 --> 02:03:16.662]  It's about controlling the internet.
[02:03:17.123 --> 02:03:21.726]  It's about giving a few people infinite and unending copyright controls.
[02:03:21.806 --> 02:03:27.350]  It's about allowing them to use that copyright control to shut down free speech and take over the internet.
[02:03:27.891 --> 02:03:32.014]  That's why it's being opposed by a lot of privacy groups and this is what we're seeing with this type of thing.
[02:03:32.034 --> 02:03:41.141]  It brought immediate criticism from third-party ad tech companies like AppNexus which said that the do not track standards put them at a corporate disadvantage.
[02:03:42.682 --> 02:03:43.383]  You don't understand.
[02:03:43.403 --> 02:03:45.866]  That was the point in the first place.
[02:03:46.326 --> 02:03:48.569]  It was never there to protect your privacy.
[02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:52.173]  It was there to put other people out of business.
[02:03:53.114 --> 02:03:55.276]  We saw this happen with the banks, right?
[02:03:55.376 --> 02:03:56.057]  The bank bailouts.
[02:03:56.077 --> 02:03:57.038]  Who got the bank bailouts?
[02:03:57.619 --> 02:04:02.822]  Well, interestingly enough, you know, the big seven guys, the ones who are too big to fail, they get the big bailouts.
[02:04:02.922 --> 02:04:08.365]  But as Drudge was reporting at the time, every year we would see the tally at the end of the year.
[02:04:08.385 --> 02:04:10.346]  You know, 130, 150 more banks go out of business.
[02:04:10.386 --> 02:04:11.487]  Those are the small guys.
[02:04:11.507 --> 02:04:14.669]  Those are the competitors to the guys who own Washington.
[02:04:14.709 --> 02:04:19.612]  And nothing that the big guys could do, nothing the big banks could do, would ever harm them.
[02:04:20.012 --> 02:04:24.097]  Even when they were caught laundering money for the Sinaloa drug cartel.
[02:04:24.137 --> 02:04:28.081]  You had HSBC giving the Sinaloa drug cartel, you know, El Chapo.
[02:04:28.121 --> 02:04:32.005]  Everybody was all freaked out about El Chapo getting out of prison.
[02:04:32.646 --> 02:04:33.927]  What a horrible thing that was.
[02:04:33.967 --> 02:04:34.608]  This guy is loose.
[02:04:34.628 --> 02:04:35.209]  Well, guess what?
[02:04:36.457 --> 02:04:42.221]  The largest banks, the too-big-to-fail banks, was given a pass by the Obama Attorney General.
[02:04:42.501 --> 02:04:51.067]  He said, I wouldn't help to take any criminal sanctions against these guys, even though they gave El Chapo his own personal window to launder money.
[02:04:51.587 --> 02:04:53.528]  They slapped them on the wrist and said, no problem.
[02:04:54.089 --> 02:04:55.430]  That's how this rolls out.
[02:04:55.770 --> 02:04:58.431]  That's why this is not about your privacy.
[02:04:58.752 --> 02:05:03.935]  This is about a corporate fascism, a corporate takeover of our government.
[02:05:04.135 --> 02:05:05.076]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:05:10.532 --> 02:05:17.494]  In response to President Obama's plan to enact gun control through executive order, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said, come and take it.
[02:05:18.074 --> 02:05:21.835]  Abbott tweeted out, quote, Obama wants to impose more gun control.
[02:05:22.255 --> 02:05:23.975]  My response, come and take it.
[02:05:24.736 --> 02:05:31.818]  The president will meet with Attorney General Laurie Lynch to discuss what executive actions he's going to take to infringe the Second Amendment while bypassing Congress.
[02:05:32.498 --> 02:05:37.039]  The word is he's going to try and prevent people on the government's no-fly list from being able to purchase firearms.
[02:05:37.739 --> 02:05:47.245]  But, as we previously reported, thousands of law-abiding Americans have been wrongly placed on the no-fly list due to false information, clerical errors, or political persecution.
[02:05:48.026 --> 02:05:55.071]  In fact, it violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process by allowing the government to deprive people of their rights based only on suspicion.
[02:05:55.691 --> 02:06:00.975]  In other words, Obama wants to dictatorially restrict the Second Amendment rights of thousands of Americans.
[02:06:01.655 --> 02:06:04.037]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com.
[02:06:08.928 --> 02:06:13.750]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[02:07:08.772 --> 02:07:15.598]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered 6 months free at Christmas.
[02:07:15.678 --> 02:07:18.381]  We've always offered 5 months free.
[02:07:18.581 --> 02:07:24.146]  But since I announced 6 free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[02:07:24.506 --> 02:07:27.649]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[02:07:27.909 --> 02:07:30.872]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[02:07:31.172 --> 02:07:39.920]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:08:27.125 --> 02:08:30.666]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:08:31.166 --> 02:08:33.026]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:33.166 --> 02:08:35.547]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:35.587 --> 02:08:36.707]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[02:08:36.767 --> 02:08:39.148]  We're going to be joining our reporters at the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:39.168 --> 02:08:40.168]  They're going to be in Oregon.
[02:08:40.188 --> 02:08:43.349]  Going to get a live update as to what is happening there.
[02:08:43.369 --> 02:08:49.970]  Of course, the media is portraying this as armed fanatics who want to overthrow the government.
[02:08:50.010 --> 02:08:53.511]  We're going to talk a little bit about the background in this particular case.
[02:08:54.051 --> 02:08:59.254]  I do feel that taking over this federal facility, as we've said, just plays right into the hands of Obama.
[02:08:59.654 --> 02:09:04.516]  I feel that it is a bad tactic and I feel like they're not looking at the overall strategy.
[02:09:05.157 --> 02:09:14.541]  This was a very egregious case and we should focus on those details and get people to understand other things that they can do about this, but get people on board before they
[02:09:15.902 --> 02:09:16.523]  Go this route.
[02:09:16.783 --> 02:09:20.266]  As Stuart Rhodes was saying, he said, look, you're frustrated?
[02:09:20.286 --> 02:09:21.367]  You want to take the fight to them?
[02:09:21.927 --> 02:09:22.788]  You don't have to do that.
[02:09:22.848 --> 02:09:24.670]  Believe me, the fight is coming to you.
[02:09:24.690 --> 02:09:25.690]  Okay?
[02:09:25.790 --> 02:09:28.593]  Don't be the one to fire the first shot.
[02:09:28.633 --> 02:09:30.735]  The one who fires the first shot loses.
[02:09:31.395 --> 02:09:33.337]  That's why we had a Pearl Harbor.
[02:09:33.517 --> 02:09:36.600]  FDR wanted to make sure that they fired the first shot.
[02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:43.686]  And he was willing to pay a horrific price in terms of lives, in terms of the Navy's equipment for that.
[02:09:44.710 --> 02:09:49.152]  Now, I want to talk about, and we're going to, of course we look at what's happening with the stock market.
[02:09:49.192 --> 02:09:51.013]  The Dow is still down about 400 points, about 2.5%.
[02:09:51.053 --> 02:09:53.414]  You know, that's one casino.
[02:09:54.135 --> 02:09:58.257]  I'm going to talk about a rigging of the multi-state lottery.
[02:09:59.110 --> 02:09:59.610]  How about that?
[02:09:59.671 --> 02:10:01.532]  That's kind of the poor man's casino.
[02:10:01.832 --> 02:10:02.093]  That's right.
[02:10:02.113 --> 02:10:03.434]  We're going to talk about that in just a moment.
[02:10:03.474 --> 02:10:06.096]  Before we do, I want to let you know about the specials that we have.
[02:10:06.136 --> 02:10:15.765]  Again, we have 15% off across the board at infowarestore.com this week only with promo code GIFT15 or you can also use promo code 2016.
[02:10:16.846 --> 02:10:20.149]  Either one of those will get you 15% off everything at the store.
[02:10:20.549 --> 02:10:22.211]  We have a resolution pack with
[02:10:22.811 --> 02:10:33.257]  Nascent iodine, vitamin B12, and a cleansing formula, all of those things will help you to start out a healthier new year, part of your new health kick, if you've made a resolution to do that.
[02:10:33.297 --> 02:10:36.879]  But it also applies to other things that we have, like the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[02:10:37.419 --> 02:10:41.822]  Incredibly, the InfoWars solar base station power supply is also including that 15% off.
[02:10:41.902 --> 02:10:43.003]  And we have a 50% off, 5-0% off
[02:10:47.385 --> 02:10:49.787]  Of Prison Planet TV if you get an annual subscription.
[02:10:49.807 --> 02:10:51.268]  That's only about 10 cents a day.
[02:10:51.668 --> 02:10:52.909]  It helps to support our operation.
[02:10:53.269 --> 02:10:58.433]  It gives you and your friends that you can share this with access to all of Alex Jones's documentaries.
[02:10:58.493 --> 02:11:00.934]  That's how you get people to wake up.
[02:11:01.334 --> 02:11:04.537]  You have to give them that deep background of what's going on.
[02:11:04.597 --> 02:11:12.062]  So all of that you can get at 50% off for the Prison Planet TV membership and 15% across the board for everything we sell.
[02:11:12.162 --> 02:11:14.203]  Health products, t-shirts, you name it.
[02:11:14.563 --> 02:11:16.545]  Right there at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:11:17.525 --> 02:11:21.789]  Okay, so the poor man's casino, the lottery system.
[02:11:22.750 --> 02:11:28.375]  We have reported in Denver the Colorado Lottery is investigating whether its lottery was rigged.
[02:11:29.187 --> 02:11:31.569]  An Iowa man is now set to go on trial there in July.
[02:11:31.609 --> 02:11:38.373]  He's accused of buying tickets with numbers that he knew would win in several states, including Colorado, and then collecting.
[02:11:38.873 --> 02:11:39.754]  Now, who is this guy?
[02:11:40.334 --> 02:11:45.578]  Well, it turns out he's the head of security for the Multi-State Lottery Association.
[02:11:46.038 --> 02:11:49.480]  He created the system that generates the winning numbers.
[02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:51.321]  This guy's name is Tipton.
[02:11:52.002 --> 02:11:54.463]  He has already been convicted of rigging the Iowa lottery.
[02:11:54.844 --> 02:11:56.645]  He faces 10 years in prison for that.
[02:11:57.145 --> 02:12:04.129]  But while appealing that, he is now being charged in connection with rigging lotteries in five other states, including Colorado.
[02:12:04.169 --> 02:12:07.251]  That's something that the mainstream media is not reporting.
[02:12:07.831 --> 02:12:15.775]  The fact that they are rigging the system, and you still got poor people who are pouring their money into this casino.
[02:12:16.215 --> 02:12:18.136]  That's something that I know people are free to do.
[02:12:18.176 --> 02:12:23.659]  Hey David, just to cut in here, I wanted to show you that if you look on screen, Joe Biggs is at the press conference in Oregon right now.
[02:12:23.759 --> 02:12:25.140]  He'll be joining us live in the next segment.
[02:12:26.741 --> 02:12:32.428]  Press conference right now, you can see Joe Biggs over the shoulder of Eamon Bundy, and he is currently having a press conference.
[02:12:32.448 --> 02:12:33.549]  Do we have an audio feed on that?
[02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:34.410]  Are we going to go to that?
[02:12:35.352 --> 02:12:41.079]  County, and for, in this valley, and for protecting their private property.
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:44.643]  And these things are what this is about.
[02:12:47.991 --> 02:12:57.939]  That because we have allowed our federal government to step outside the bounds of the Constitution, they have come down upon the people and are prosecuting them now directly.
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:14.814]  They are coming down into the states and taking over the land and the resources, putting the people into duress, putting the people into poverty, and putting entire counties and entire states into undue obedience.
[02:13:17.035 --> 02:13:24.600]  I have asked that Shauna Cox read you what we have titled the Notice Redress of Grievance.
[02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:33.306]  And to give you a little background, we have spent several weeks, two months to be exact,
[02:13:34.307 --> 02:13:44.190]  In petitioning the state and the local county representatives to stand for the Hammonds against these unconstitutional actions.
[02:13:45.310 --> 02:13:56.693]  And we have done this through petitions, we have done this through... Alright, let's pull that back and as we talked about that and I absolutely agree with him and we have
[02:13:57.759 --> 02:14:07.103]  We have written articles on Infowars.com talking about the constitutional basis and the unconstitutional actions of the federal government, and he was exactly right.
[02:14:07.384 --> 02:14:16.328]  They do not have the jurisdiction to come down into the territories, but of course, we see the acquiescence of the sheriffs in letting them do that.
[02:14:17.068 --> 02:14:20.489]  And what do you do in an area that doesn't want to protect people's rights?
[02:14:20.549 --> 02:14:21.890]  And that's the real key issue there.
[02:14:22.430 --> 02:14:23.990]  They have a reservation mentality.
[02:14:24.450 --> 02:14:27.291]  As I pointed out, the federal government owns over half the land in Oregon.
[02:14:27.952 --> 02:14:32.153]  And as other people have pointed out, over half the people in that area work for the federal government.
[02:14:32.193 --> 02:14:34.654]  So they basically have a slave mentality.
[02:14:34.694 --> 02:14:36.894]  I think that's why they won't stand up and fight it.
[02:14:36.954 --> 02:14:42.116]  And if they don't want to stand up and fight it, that is the wrong place, the wrong time to do it.
[02:14:42.356 --> 02:14:44.657]  People have to, you have to have a core of people
[02:14:45.157 --> 02:14:50.261]  We're going to stand up in opposition and stand together peacefully to take back their freedoms.
[02:14:50.821 --> 02:14:51.962]  There are many ways that we can do this.
[02:14:52.002 --> 02:14:53.964]  We can do it at the state level with state nullification.
[02:14:53.984 --> 02:14:56.305]  We can do it at the individual level with jury nullification.
[02:14:57.046 --> 02:15:04.211]  This whole thing could have been short-circuited if we had jurors who knew their rights and their duties as jurors.
[02:15:04.231 --> 02:15:11.357]  And that is to make sure that you don't have someone like this rancher, that someone who is a law-abiding citizen, get railroaded
[02:15:11.937 --> 02:15:13.019]  By the federal government.
[02:15:13.039 --> 02:15:16.443]  Let me jump now to this article that Kurt Nemo has.
[02:15:17.264 --> 02:15:20.909]  Hammonds were targeted because the government wants to steal their land.
[02:15:21.490 --> 02:15:26.337]  And he quotes from an article in October by the Tri-State Livestock News.
[02:15:26.397 --> 02:15:28.259]  And it's very interesting because in this article,
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:36.443]  They have quotes from retired full-time BLM employees and others who know what the inside game is here.
[02:15:36.763 --> 02:15:45.546]  According to the article, the BLM often worked with ranchers on collaborative burns to manage invasive juniper that steal water from the grass and from other cover.
[02:15:46.267 --> 02:15:57.611]  Aaron Maupin, a former BLM range technician and watershed specialist and rancher in the area, said backfires by other ranchers had burned BLM land in the past and the agency had not taken action.
[02:15:58.271 --> 02:16:10.615]  During her tenure as a full-time BLM employee from 1997 to 99, Maupin recalled other fires that had accidentally spilt over onto BLM land, but only the Hammonds, only the Hammonds have been charged.
[02:16:11.475 --> 02:16:12.956]  Arrested and sentenced, she said.
[02:16:13.496 --> 02:16:19.320]  Ranchers, quote, would call the BLM, would go out to help them put it out, and it wasn't a big deal, unquote.
[02:16:19.801 --> 02:16:28.988]  On the other hand, she said, there were numerous instances of BLM fires spreading to private land and ranchers losing significant number of cattle and other property.
[02:16:29.228 --> 02:16:34.672]  Moffin said she was unaware of the BLM compensating ranchers for any of their private destroyed property.
[02:16:35.393 --> 02:16:40.877]  And she points out, he does in this article I should say, that BLM recklessness is not limited to Oregon.
[02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:48.006]  Kurt Nemo quotes, he says, in 2013, two South Dakota prescribed burns started by the U.S.
[02:16:48.026 --> 02:16:54.652]  Forest Service over the objections of area landowners, blew out of control, burned thousands of acres of federal and private land.
[02:16:55.033 --> 02:17:06.164]  Ranchers that suffered property damage from the Potray Fire in Perkins County, South Dakota, filed extensive tort claims in accordance with federal requirements, but will receive no compensation.
[02:17:06.764 --> 02:17:09.466]  Because USDA, Department of Agriculture, found the U.S.
[02:17:09.486 --> 02:17:11.727]  Forest Service wasn't responsible for that fire.
[02:17:12.288 --> 02:17:14.389]  Just like we see happening with the EPA.
[02:17:14.809 --> 02:17:18.272]  We know the EPA intentionally polluted the Animas River.
[02:17:18.772 --> 02:17:19.092]  Okay?
[02:17:19.152 --> 02:17:26.817]  That is something that a geologist, Dave Taylor, wrote in a July 30th editorial, predicted this massive spill that happened back in August.
[02:17:26.857 --> 02:17:27.438]  He said, look,
[02:17:27.978 --> 02:17:31.802]  The EPA plan is really a blitzkrieg for a superfund.
[02:17:31.842 --> 02:17:33.603]  This guy was a retired engineer.
[02:17:33.643 --> 02:17:37.287]  He said what they're proposing to do is going to blow that mine up.
[02:17:37.387 --> 02:17:43.732]  It's going to create a massive environmental issue, and they're going to use that to increase their power.
[02:17:44.313 --> 02:17:47.115]  He said the grand experiment, in my opinion, will fail, and guess what?
[02:17:48.151 --> 02:17:55.514]  They'll say, well, Plan A didn't work, so I guess we'll have to build a treatment plant that will cost taxpayers $100 million to $500 million.
[02:17:55.974 --> 02:17:59.976]  He says, reading between the lines, I believe that has been the EPA's plan all along.
[02:18:00.356 --> 02:18:08.299]  And then we found out a couple of weeks later, on August 22nd, we found out that the EPA knew of the blowout risk for the tainted water at the mine.
[02:18:08.319 --> 02:18:11.261]  And then there was an investigation by the Department of Interior.
[02:18:11.621 --> 02:18:22.546]  Found out the EPA was solely responsible for the toxic mustard-colored waters that contaminated rivers in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and the Navajo Nation back in August.
[02:18:22.947 --> 02:18:29.510]  The EPA claimed that the spill was, quote, likely inevitable, but research carried out by the Interior Bureau of Reclamation disagreed.
[02:18:30.090 --> 02:18:34.413]  The spill released arsenic, mercury, lead, other contaminants into the Animas River.
[02:18:34.773 --> 02:18:40.977]  Thousands of drinking water wells as far as 100 miles away created a natural disaster.
[02:18:41.498 --> 02:18:42.178]  Then guess what?
[02:18:42.598 --> 02:18:50.243]  We find out that the contractor behind this spill got $381 million from the taxpayers.
[02:18:50.864 --> 02:18:52.085]  Same thing we see all the time.
[02:18:52.645 --> 02:19:05.853]  The government does these irresponsible, massively irresponsible operations, damages beyond belief the property and the water or the land of other people, and then hold themselves absolutely not responsible.
[02:19:06.713 --> 02:19:12.816]  They don't even pay for the cleanup, let alone fire anybody, let alone send anyone to jail for criminal negligence.
[02:19:12.876 --> 02:19:14.678]  No, they do it, and they do it with immunity.
[02:19:15.854 --> 02:19:30.190]  Now Kurt Nemo goes on to point out, as part of this deal to fend off an effort by federal government to designate the Steens Mountain as a federal monument, ranchers in the area traded their BLM permits and private property for land on the valley floor and allowed Congress to create a 170,000 acre wilderness in 2000.
[02:19:33.956 --> 02:19:39.418]  Now, Moppen went to say the last holdouts on that cow-free wilderness are the Hammonds, right?
[02:19:39.458 --> 02:19:40.418]  They want to get rid of them.
[02:19:40.458 --> 02:19:42.199]  They want to force them off the land.
[02:19:42.479 --> 02:19:42.799]  Why?
[02:19:43.239 --> 02:19:49.461]  Because a geological survey indicates there's a high potential for silver, gold, copper, mercury, uranium, and molybdenum.
[02:19:49.902 --> 02:19:50.182]  Okay?
[02:19:50.642 --> 02:19:53.363]  This is exactly what's happening in Arizona with John McCain.
[02:19:54.043 --> 02:19:58.008]  Destroying this area that the Apaches have in that area.
[02:19:58.249 --> 02:20:03.215]  Destroying the park so they can hand over copper licenses to a multinational corporation.
[02:20:03.595 --> 02:20:04.817]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:20:09.338 --> 02:20:18.664]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day, but growing scientific evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.

[02:21:08.999 --> 02:21:12.160]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?

[02:22:08.942 --> 02:22:15.166]  Chronic inflammation is now known to block your ability to repair and compromises your immune system, making you more vulnerable to all diseases.
[02:22:15.626 --> 02:22:20.609]  Since poor diet, injuries or stress are all contributing factors, many people suffer from inflammation.
[02:22:20.809 --> 02:22:25.692]  Your body's number one means of neutralizing inflammation and the pain that it may be causing is glutathione.
[02:22:25.952 --> 02:22:30.275]  Glutathione is the body's number one peptide to neutralize free radicals and thus stop inflammation.
[02:22:30.495 --> 02:22:31.636]  Hi, my name is Jason.
[02:22:31.736 --> 02:22:32.677]  I'm 44 years old.
[02:22:32.837 --> 02:22:39.064]  For 10 years, I had been suffering from chronic pain in my abdomen and groin that radiated down into my feet.
[02:22:39.224 --> 02:22:46.432]  After three weeks on One World Way, the pain in my feet reduced by 50% and the overall pain in my body reduced significantly as well.
[02:22:46.552 --> 02:22:47.593]  I ran out of One World Way
[02:22:47.853 --> 02:22:48.874]  And the pain returned.
[02:22:49.094 --> 02:22:54.740]  I got another container and again, after three weeks, the pain reduced significantly throughout my body.
[02:22:54.900 --> 02:22:59.484]  I'd highly recommend One World Way to anyone dealing with chronic pain due to inflammation.
[02:22:59.564 --> 02:23:00.766]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:23:00.786 --> 02:23:01.727]  That's One World, W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:23:08.203 --> 02:23:14.930]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[02:23:15.291 --> 02:23:18.955]  It caught me totally by surprise, and it involves FEMA.
[02:23:19.295 --> 02:23:22.258]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[02:23:22.699 --> 02:23:27.784]  Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[02:23:28.365 --> 02:23:32.387]  Watch the viral video at FEMA3.com before it disappears again.
[02:23:32.727 --> 02:23:38.329]  But be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is, they must know something we don't.
[02:23:38.889 --> 02:23:48.914]  Go to FEMA3.com to see the number one item you should be hoarding and why supplies of this critical item are so low or even completely sold out at many stores across America.

[02:23:50.855 --> 02:23:55.558]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in recent days.
[02:23:56.038 --> 02:24:01.301]  Go to FEMA3.com and discover the number one most critical item in a crisis.
[02:24:01.641 --> 02:24:04.943]  Watch the shocking video right now at FEMA3.com.
[02:24:05.304 --> 02:24:06.404]  Again, that's FEMA3.com.
[02:24:31.078 --> 02:24:32.239]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:32.259 --> 02:24:34.901]  I'm David Knight, and we're going to be joined by reporters in Oregon shortly.
[02:24:34.961 --> 02:24:41.606]  As you can see, they were at the press conference that Ammon Bundy was having there at the federal facility that they've taken over.
[02:24:42.655 --> 02:24:45.417]  And they're going to be joining us with a report in just a moment.
[02:24:45.497 --> 02:24:48.038]  Before they do, let's go to something that's a little bit light.
[02:24:48.118 --> 02:24:54.722]  This is an article that I saw in the Drudge Report from the Daily Mail and I thought it was crazy and hilarious.
[02:24:54.762 --> 02:24:57.303]  It's a New Year's message from Coco the Gorilla.
[02:24:57.804 --> 02:25:00.065]  Because, you know, they've tried scaring us with Al Gore.
[02:25:00.125 --> 02:25:04.928]  They've tried appealing to us and saying, you know, this is more important than anything.
[02:25:05.488 --> 02:25:10.551]  The religion of global warming is more important than the Catholic religion or Christianity or whatever with the Pope.
[02:25:10.951 --> 02:25:13.493]  So they've tried Al Gore, they've tried the Pope, so you still don't get it.
[02:25:13.553 --> 02:25:16.695]  Well, they're going to roll out the 800-pound gorilla in the room.
[02:25:16.736 --> 02:25:17.616]  Maybe you'll pay attention.
[02:25:17.676 --> 02:25:18.657]  And what does he have to say?
[02:25:18.737 --> 02:25:19.277]  Or she says?
[02:25:19.318 --> 02:25:19.998]  This is Coco.
[02:25:20.378 --> 02:25:23.761]  The gorilla says, uh, stop destroying the planet.
[02:25:24.101 --> 02:25:25.122]  Man, stupid.
[02:25:25.903 --> 02:25:26.443]  Well, you know what?
[02:25:28.504 --> 02:25:29.665]  Monkey see, monkey do.
[02:25:29.965 --> 02:25:33.388]  The real story behind this is the educational aspect of this.
[02:25:33.408 --> 02:25:35.709]  And of course, you know, I've got a border collie myself.
[02:25:35.849 --> 02:25:39.312]  And this, my border collie is every bit as smart as this gorilla.
[02:25:39.392 --> 02:25:42.614]  And even better, because my border collie doesn't think man is stupid.
[02:25:43.094 --> 02:25:45.356]  My border collie thinks man is awesome.
[02:25:46.116 --> 02:25:53.001]  And my border colleague understands that all this stuff about global warming doesn't have even a proper context.
[02:25:53.021 --> 02:26:03.548]  Remember, we had the founder of the Weather Channel being interviewed by Alex Jones, and he was talking about how they don't even have a baseline to talk about a one degree change.
[02:26:03.568 --> 02:26:09.072]  You know, we're supposed to believe that a one and a half degree change, a two degree change, is going to destroy the Earth.
[02:26:10.193 --> 02:26:11.514]  We don't have a baseline for that.
[02:26:12.551 --> 02:26:24.676]  When you go back and you look at the few data points that they have with that kind of accuracy, understand, they can go in and they can extrapolate things from ice cores or whatever, but they don't, can't get down to that level of accuracy.
[02:26:24.796 --> 02:26:34.220]  So, you know, when we look at their models, their models, for the most part, untestable, because they're talking about things that are 50, 100 years in the future.
[02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:37.801]  But where their models can be tested, they've been shown to be wrong.
[02:26:38.241 --> 02:26:39.042]  They've shown to fail.
[02:26:39.682 --> 02:26:41.923]  Now, my border collie understands all that.
[02:26:42.583 --> 02:26:49.751]  Because my border collie listens to me talk to my wife and my children about all this stuff, and, you know, look at me, look at my wife, nod his head, yeah, I agree.
[02:26:50.252 --> 02:26:56.959]  And so my border collie understands all this stuff, but this gorilla has been thoroughly indoctrinated by some people who have taught it a script.
[02:26:57.500 --> 02:27:03.264]  You know, some of the stuff this gorilla is saying, he says, I am gorilla, fix earth, help, fix the earth, okay?
[02:27:03.385 --> 02:27:09.389]  I am flowers, animals, I am nature, Coco, love man, earth, Coco, love, okay?
[02:27:09.809 --> 02:27:11.791]  Coco has been given a script.
[02:27:12.191 --> 02:27:14.553]  Coco has been thoroughly indoctrinated.
[02:27:14.573 --> 02:27:15.514]  And you know what?
[02:27:15.814 --> 02:27:18.116]  If you don't take control of your children's education,
[02:27:18.795 --> 02:27:21.798]  Your children are going to be monkey see, monkey do.
[02:27:22.318 --> 02:27:23.099]  Just like Coco.
[02:27:23.599 --> 02:27:32.908]  They're going to repeat all the nonsense that is stuffed into their head about climate change, about global warming, about white privilege, you name it.
[02:27:33.108 --> 02:27:36.631]  Whatever the government's agenda is, that's what they're going to repeat to you.
[02:27:36.651 --> 02:27:39.594]  Because that's fundamentally what education is about anymore.
[02:27:40.214 --> 02:27:42.576]  It's not about giving children tools of learning.
[02:27:42.596 --> 02:27:45.077]  It's not about cultivating independent thought.
[02:27:45.518 --> 02:27:48.840]  It's not about establishing a love of individual liberty.
[02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:52.602]  It's about getting them to do what the government wants.
[02:27:52.662 --> 02:27:58.686]  That has been the goal and the purpose of education, and I think you can see it very easily with this video.
[02:27:58.726 --> 02:28:04.490]  And of course, as Alex had pointed out earlier when he was talking about the TSA, he said, the TSA is nothing but dog training.
[02:28:04.970 --> 02:28:05.370]  That's right.
[02:28:05.450 --> 02:28:10.411]  So, you got a dog, you got children, make sure they're getting the right kind of training.
[02:28:10.471 --> 02:28:13.672]  Make sure that you understand what they're being taught in school.
[02:28:14.092 --> 02:28:15.512]  Question them if you send them to school.
[02:28:15.552 --> 02:28:17.032]  Of course, we can't all homeschool our kids.
[02:28:17.312 --> 02:28:19.433]  But you need to understand what they're being taught in school.
[02:28:19.473 --> 02:28:25.854]  And I can pretty much tell you at this point, if you're putting them in a government school, that agenda is being set out of Washington.
[02:28:26.394 --> 02:28:30.255]  It is an anti-American, anti-humanity agenda that they're giving them.
[02:28:30.515 --> 02:28:32.195]  It's an anti-Christian agenda, you name it.
[02:28:32.675 --> 02:28:37.940]  It's opposed to pretty much everything that I respect, and that's why we've not put our children in school.
[02:28:37.980 --> 02:28:40.102]  We started out, my wife was a school teacher.
[02:28:40.502 --> 02:28:47.869]  She saw the way that children were being abused in the system through things like tenure, that they would not allow bad teachers to be fired.
[02:28:48.249 --> 02:28:53.354]  We said we're not going to do that to our children, but it's gotten far, far worse than anything that I grew up in.
[02:28:54.628 --> 02:29:01.214]  If you went to school, understand the school that your children are in today isn't anything at all like what you went through.
[02:29:01.834 --> 02:29:12.424]  So you need to look very closely, very carefully at what is happening to your children or they're going to exploit them just like they exploited this gorilla for that hokey message.
[02:29:13.585 --> 02:29:15.527]  Now of course tonight we're going to have Obama
[02:29:16.493 --> 02:29:20.097]  He's lecturing us and creating this dog and pony show, working with CNN.
[02:29:20.117 --> 02:29:25.742]  They're going to have a crowd there and the crowd is going to say, Obama, we just need you to do more, to take the guns, to control the guns.
[02:29:26.743 --> 02:29:32.709]  And the irony, of course, with all of this, is at the same time our government is arming Al Qaeda.
[02:29:33.610 --> 02:29:38.391]  At the same time, they're bringing in all these migrants without any background checks.
[02:29:38.451 --> 02:29:41.332]  And of course, our president never had a background check either, did he?
[02:29:41.952 --> 02:29:43.052]  That's part of the problem.
[02:29:43.552 --> 02:29:53.315]  The most secretive president we've had, and now he is flooding our country with people from areas that are war-torn because he was bombing them using assassination drones in these countries.
[02:29:53.375 --> 02:29:56.716]  Now he's bringing those people into our country to bring unrest.
[02:29:56.736 --> 02:29:58.596]  But they're going to focus on what's going on in Oregon.
[02:29:58.616 --> 02:29:59.596]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:29:59.836 --> 02:30:01.337]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.357 --> 02:30:05.159]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.101 --> 02:30:12.743]  Thanks to the Federal Reserve System, America's economy is in a terminal decline.
[02:30:12.983 --> 02:30:18.046]  And according to economic expert Michael Snyder, here's 8 facts that reveal just how bad the economy really is.
[02:30:18.287 --> 02:30:18.527]  Number 1.
[02:30:18.707 --> 02:30:21.829]  The majority of all American workers bring home less than $30,000 a year in wages.
[02:30:21.849 --> 02:30:21.969]  Number 2.
[02:30:24.090 --> 02:30:29.173]  The poorest 40% of all Americans now spend most of their incomes just on food and housing.
[02:30:29.373 --> 02:30:34.556]  At least 50% of Americans who rent their homes spend more than a third of their incomes on the rent.
[02:30:34.837 --> 02:30:37.418]  Incomes keep declining for a large majority of the U.S.
[02:30:37.458 --> 02:30:38.519]  population.
[02:30:39.179 --> 02:30:41.501]  The price of ground beef has more than doubled since 2009.
[02:30:41.541 --> 02:30:45.023]  The rate of homeownership in the U.S.
[02:30:45.063 --> 02:30:47.164]  has been declining for at least seven years in a row.
[02:30:47.404 --> 02:30:50.526]  It's now the lowest that it's been in 20 years.
[02:30:50.787 --> 02:30:53.048]  Almost half of all Americans are not saving their money.
[02:30:53.208 --> 02:30:57.210]  And it's been estimated that 62% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
[02:30:57.370 --> 02:30:57.610]  Number 8.
[02:30:58.190 --> 02:31:01.832]  One-third of all Americans with student loans are currently behind on their student loan debt.
[02:31:01.932 --> 02:31:07.275]  Check out InfoWars.com for more economic news and also our new YouTube channel, Resistance News.
[02:31:07.415 --> 02:31:08.656]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[02:31:08.996 --> 02:31:12.217]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:12.498 --> 02:31:17.500]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[02:31:17.500 --> 02:31:17.960]  We're good to go.
[02:31:38.917 --> 02:31:39.818]  Brain Force is here.
[02:31:40.019 --> 02:31:42.102]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:31:42.222 --> 02:31:46.968]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:31:47.209 --> 02:31:50.393]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:31:50.513 --> 02:31:53.698]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:31:53.998 --> 02:31:55.741]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:31:55.981 --> 02:31:56.861]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:31:56.881 --> 02:31:57.821]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:31:58.061 --> 02:31:59.942]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[02:33:17.795 --> 02:33:19.518]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:21.887 --> 02:33:23.247]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:23.367 --> 02:33:27.649]  I'm David Knight, your host, and we're going to go to our crew who are live at the standoff in Oregon.
[02:33:28.049 --> 02:33:34.011]  Just quickly before we do, if you want to call in and talk about this or anything that we've been talking about during the show, the number is 800-259-9231.
[02:33:34.031 --> 02:33:34.611]  Again, that number is 800-259-9231.
[02:33:34.631 --> 02:33:35.192]  Let's go to our crew.
[02:33:35.212 --> 02:33:37.292]  Joe Biggs is on the ground at the standoff in Oregon.
[02:33:37.312 --> 02:33:37.452]  Joe?
[02:33:45.279 --> 02:33:47.143]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[02:33:47.163 --> 02:33:51.171]  Now we're live outside of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.
[02:33:51.191 --> 02:33:54.477]  And as you can see, the press conference just ended.
[02:33:54.578 --> 02:33:56.962]  Fox News, CNN, various other
[02:33:57.896 --> 02:33:59.437]  News agencies were just covering that.
[02:33:59.457 --> 02:34:01.397]  We were able to get a lot of footage of that.
[02:34:01.837 --> 02:34:06.459]  Ammon Bundy was the main speaker at this and also a couple other people that you brought up as well.
[02:34:06.479 --> 02:34:18.803]  Some other ranchers that could help people understand what it is ranchers go through and how this federal overreach really affects Americans and how that in the end can end up affecting a lot of the people out here.
[02:34:20.203 --> 02:34:26.388]  From what we heard today, Ammon Bundy said that the Hammonds are supposed to be turning themselves in to jail.
[02:34:26.948 --> 02:34:34.114]  They've already been to jail once, and now they're saying that they are having to go back again for another sentence as well.
[02:34:34.394 --> 02:34:40.499]  So this really shows you the overstepping of the federal government, how they're going out, they're seizing land, they're really hurting
[02:34:41.039 --> 02:34:49.203]  American people everyday hard-working people, you know yesterday I was on Twitter and the main trending Hashtag was Oregon under attack.
[02:34:49.563 --> 02:34:59.749]  Well, I don't see anything under attack We're in the middle of nowhere David as you can see tomorrow left to my right for all you can see is nothing but land They're actually gonna take some people down here and show the
[02:35:01.202 --> 02:35:01.682]  I think so.
[02:35:21.727 --> 02:35:23.489]  And now you have this out here.
[02:35:23.589 --> 02:35:29.015]  They basically took an unoccupied building and they are standing in protest.
[02:35:29.035 --> 02:35:30.457]  There's no people here that can be harmed.
[02:35:30.717 --> 02:35:32.759]  There's no one around here that can be hurt by this.
[02:35:33.100 --> 02:35:34.301]  I've seen no cops today.
[02:35:34.321 --> 02:35:35.503]  Nothing like that whatsoever.
[02:35:35.963 --> 02:35:37.485]  But the interesting thing about that
[02:35:38.065 --> 02:35:58.087]  Is tonight, the speech that Obama is going to give, is he going to use this situation and keep pushing the mainstream narrative that white terror is out here, that white terror breeds, that these are the ones that are carrying out attacks, that that's the real threat, not ISIS, that he himself is the one that's actually funding and giving arms to.
[02:35:59.025 --> 02:36:00.106]  Yeah, absolutely, Joe.
[02:36:00.146 --> 02:36:07.671]  And of course, just to clarify for people, what is happening here is you've got mandatory minimums, as I was talking to Lionel earlier in the show.
[02:36:07.691 --> 02:36:11.733]  You've got mandatory minimums that came on as part of the drug war.
[02:36:12.394 --> 02:36:17.037]  Later, they added them after the Oklahoma City bombing, and that's what they're doing with this.
[02:36:17.057 --> 02:36:23.441]  They said, well, OK, we're going to call this arson, which means that it's terrorism, so we're going to send these people to jail for a minimum of five years.
[02:36:23.461 --> 02:36:28.084]  The judge in that time said, that would be a sentence that would shock the conscience to me.
[02:36:28.124 --> 02:36:28.785]  So that judge
[02:36:29.225 --> 02:36:39.392]  Refused to sentence them for that amount of time, but now we've got another prosecutor and an appeals judge who want to continue to push for this and they're going to make them go back and serve a minimum of five years.
[02:36:39.752 --> 02:36:42.534]  It is an absolute travesty of justice.
[02:36:43.074 --> 02:36:46.497]  But clearly, you know, I've seen the hashtag Oregon under attack.
[02:36:46.577 --> 02:36:52.701]  I took that to mean not that there was violence going on, except for the fact that Oregon is being attacked by the feds.
[02:36:53.021 --> 02:36:56.783]  And that's an ongoing attack that's been going on for a very long time that people need to wake up.
[02:36:56.843 --> 02:37:11.549]  I'm just afraid that this particular action in terms of taking over this facility is going to be very, very counterproductive, especially with Obama doing his dog and pony show tonight with the town hall calling for executive order on gun control.
[02:37:12.309 --> 02:37:15.771]  Yeah, like Alex said yesterday, the timing is all wrong right now.
[02:37:15.791 --> 02:37:19.032]  They have that, they can use that, they can go and say, look at this.
[02:37:19.611 --> 02:37:31.783]  You've got these armed militiamen who have overthrown a federal building, completely living out the facts that the fact that this is in the middle of nowhere, it was an unoccupied building, and no lives are in danger from that.
[02:37:32.184 --> 02:37:37.209]  And they're going to use that to push that anti-gun agenda, which is what he's done every year.
[02:37:37.689 --> 02:37:42.454]  Last time we were in Oregon, we were here at the Umpqua College when the mass shooting happened there, and what did he do?
[02:37:43.514 --> 02:37:43.814]  I don't
[02:38:15.110 --> 02:38:15.470]  I don't
[02:38:34.338 --> 02:38:36.861]  Well, we're getting some break-up from you, Joe.
[02:38:36.881 --> 02:38:38.903]  We're getting some break-up from you.
[02:38:38.923 --> 02:38:42.767]  Of course, what they really need to do is people need to understand jury nullification.
[02:38:42.787 --> 02:38:43.648]  They can shut this down.
[02:38:43.668 --> 02:38:51.916]  I mean, Bloomberg themselves are talking about how in over half of the cases that are brought against gun dealers, the juries refuse to convict the people there.
[02:38:52.637 --> 02:38:56.759]  The other aspect of this, which is very, very troubling, is this article that's up on Infowars.com.
[02:38:56.779 --> 02:39:06.544]  Liberal media tweets a call for the National Guard, for cops to confront the Malheur Wildlife Refuge occupiers, and you see this picture on the article, End White Terror.
[02:39:07.004 --> 02:39:13.948]  What they're really calling for is them to end white lives, because white lives don't matter to these people, and that's what they do.
[02:39:14.028 --> 02:39:17.330]  They always break this down into white versus black, into racial strata.
[02:39:17.671 --> 02:39:32.622]  We can announce now that the interview that Alex Jones is having is with Louis Farrakhan, trying to see if there is something that can be done to try to stop this intentional divide between people, black and white, between people in the city, people in the rural area.
[02:39:33.422 --> 02:39:38.746]  I would like to see some of the people in the rural areas start to come out against civil asset forfeiture.
[02:39:38.786 --> 02:39:42.508]  That is a criminal part of the new war on, well, the new war on drugs.
[02:39:42.829 --> 02:39:44.290]  That's not the new war on drugs.
[02:39:44.510 --> 02:39:47.852]  The war on drugs has been with us for 44 years.
[02:39:47.952 --> 02:39:49.453]  It's going into its 42nd year now.
[02:39:49.754 --> 02:39:51.034]  An absolute failure.
[02:39:51.495 --> 02:39:57.159]  And of course the guy who's running it with the Drug Enforcement Agency is saying that it's an absolute failure, but he's not going to stop it.
[02:39:57.859 --> 02:40:02.122]  All he will possibly do is add some drug treatment
[02:40:04.023 --> 02:40:08.205]  But of course, he's still going to use the hammer of law enforcement to try to deal with this.
[02:40:08.425 --> 02:40:16.548]  And the concern about this is not just that they're using law enforcement to deal with it, but the fact that they are destroying law enforcement to deal with this.
[02:40:17.196 --> 02:40:22.058]  They're turning our police into highway robbers, literally, with civil asset forfeiture.
[02:40:22.278 --> 02:40:28.480]  So I would like to see a recognition by people in the rural areas that, hey, this war on drugs is counterproductive.
[02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:31.521]  It has actually been a war of drugs on the black community.
[02:40:31.881 --> 02:40:33.021]  It has brought about violence.
[02:40:33.101 --> 02:40:36.902]  It has brought about a monopoly for organized crime to grow.
[02:40:36.962 --> 02:40:38.383]  It has destroyed our legal system.
[02:40:38.423 --> 02:40:39.943]  It has destroyed our property rights.
[02:40:40.343 --> 02:40:42.304]  Those are property rights everybody could understand.
[02:40:42.364 --> 02:40:45.425]  When they steal your cash, when they steal your car, don't even charge you with a crime,
[02:40:45.925 --> 02:40:51.453]  That is essentially the same principles that these people are doing out in the rural areas.
[02:40:51.473 --> 02:40:52.635]  They have different motivation.
[02:40:52.655 --> 02:40:57.502]  They want to grab the mineral rights that are there so they can hand that off to their crony capitalist friends.
[02:40:57.882 --> 02:41:01.287]  We lost contact with Joe, but Joe's back now.
[02:41:01.428 --> 02:41:02.329]  Joe, your comment.
[02:41:02.629 --> 02:41:14.339]  You know, yesterday or last night, I don't know if Montel Williams was on a drunken Twitter rampage, but he was tweeting out stuff like, I hope the federal government, you know, attacks these guys, shoots them all.
[02:41:14.919 --> 02:41:16.120]  These guys are terrorists.
[02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:17.622]  They should be treated like terrorists.
[02:41:18.042 --> 02:41:19.803]  You know, I wish there would be a drone strike.
[02:41:19.843 --> 02:41:22.506]  I mean, you can pull up Montel Williams' Twitter page.
[02:41:22.546 --> 02:41:24.007]  He said some pretty horrendous stuff.
[02:41:24.307 --> 02:41:25.548]  And it's not just him that thinks that.
[02:41:25.568 --> 02:41:27.570]  There's a lot of people out there that are
[02:41:29.284 --> 02:41:36.837]  Looking through what this mainstream media is over here and what they're pushing out saying that this is a you know a terrorist takeover when actually it's not.
[02:41:36.898 --> 02:41:39.943]  It's a peaceful stance against the government.
[02:41:40.635 --> 02:41:40.875]  That is
[02:42:02.042 --> 02:42:04.143]  that are out there that are just spewing this stuff.
[02:42:04.224 --> 02:42:06.005]  And this is what's really going on.
[02:42:06.345 --> 02:42:07.306]  A peaceful stance.
[02:42:07.346 --> 02:42:08.206]  I don't see anything.
[02:42:08.527 --> 02:42:10.048]  There's not going to be any cars flipped today.
[02:42:10.268 --> 02:42:11.669]  There's not going to be any vandalism.
[02:42:11.689 --> 02:42:13.030]  There's not going to be anyone shot.
[02:42:13.430 --> 02:42:22.096]  You know, hopefully Obama doesn't take this, send out federal agents, and then really spark something up and then use that and go, hey, they shot first.
[02:42:22.176 --> 02:42:22.797]  We didn't do it.
[02:42:22.817 --> 02:42:24.578]  Now we really need a crackdown on gun control.
[02:42:25.111 --> 02:42:25.491]  Absolutely.
[02:42:25.531 --> 02:42:27.772]  We can see that it's a peaceful situation there, as you pointed out.
[02:42:27.812 --> 02:42:31.613]  You know, we've had the situation you covered multiple times, what was going on in Ferguson.
[02:42:31.633 --> 02:42:35.194]  You had peaceful protesters who were saying, we have a broken system here.
[02:42:35.574 --> 02:42:36.394]  We need some reforms.
[02:42:36.434 --> 02:42:37.275]  We need to fix this.
[02:42:37.675 --> 02:42:44.557]  And yet there were inside agent provocateurs who would go out and start violence, start burning buildings in that neighborhood.
[02:42:45.137 --> 02:42:47.798]  But of course, nothing like that is happening here at this point.
[02:42:47.858 --> 02:42:50.999]  So it truly would be a travesty to see that.
[02:42:51.539 --> 02:42:56.803]  Well, certainly we hope that that story will come through over what the mainstream media is doing.
[02:42:56.823 --> 02:43:08.131]  Of course, the mainstream media is putting this as an armed group that aims to overthrow the government, that they're not going to leave until the 187,000 acre wildlife refuge is handed over to ranchers.
[02:43:08.151 --> 02:43:15.596]  Did you have anything, did you hear anything in the press conference from Emmen Bundy as to what the end goal was of this takeover?
[02:43:16.717 --> 02:43:21.200]  Well, what he wanted, what his demand was, was for the people who have
[02:43:22.324 --> 02:43:27.386]  Basically, put the Hammonds in a situation where they have to go back into jail again.
[02:43:27.426 --> 02:43:28.967]  They're supposed to turn themselves in today.
[02:43:29.647 --> 02:43:38.890]  They want them to have another hearing and go back through the evidence, actually break down and bring in people like the Bundys, bring in other people.
[02:43:38.931 --> 02:43:45.113]  They want to be able to have an opportunity to present evidence from the Hammonds, the family that they have.
[02:43:45.653 --> 02:43:49.654]  To really show that what's happening is completely unlawful and that's what they're saying.
[02:43:49.694 --> 02:43:50.634]  That's what their endgame is.
[02:43:50.954 --> 02:43:55.196]  That's what they want and they said they'll stand out here and they'll stay out here as long as possible.
[02:43:55.656 --> 02:43:59.097]  And add to the fact that people said armed militia took this place over.
[02:43:59.137 --> 02:44:00.457]  I've been out here for a couple hours.
[02:44:00.877 --> 02:44:02.177]  I've seen a lot of the militiamen.
[02:44:02.317 --> 02:44:04.578]  I haven't seen any guns yet whatsoever.
[02:44:05.038 --> 02:44:11.023]  But it still is a heated standoff because it's heated in the sense that we don't know what's going to happen with that speech tonight.
[02:44:11.323 --> 02:44:21.772]  Obama could really am things up and really push the narrative that this is white terror, that we need guns gone, and that's what we have to wait for tonight.
[02:44:22.072 --> 02:44:26.495]  So everyone should be in anticipation seeing what President Obama will say in that speech tonight.
[02:44:26.535 --> 02:44:29.418]  Tomorrow should be an interesting day after that is done.
[02:44:30.287 --> 02:44:42.312]  Yeah, and of course that's news in terms of new demands from M and Bundy that he wants a retrial rather than kind of a nebulous goal that we were seeing yesterday that, well, we just want everybody to come here and we're going to take back the government.
[02:44:42.352 --> 02:44:46.434]  I mean, that's not going to happen any more than calling on Obama to resign.
[02:44:46.474 --> 02:44:51.936]  But perhaps they can get a new trial, and I would hope that if they do get a new trial that people educate
[02:44:52.956 --> 02:44:54.777]  Get educated about jury nullification.
[02:44:54.797 --> 02:44:56.017]  That's what really needs to happen there.
[02:44:56.037 --> 02:44:58.898]  People need to look at this and say, you know what, you're going to send these people to jail for five years.
[02:44:59.458 --> 02:45:02.179]  I don't care if there was a fire that technically violated the law.
[02:45:02.659 --> 02:45:04.280]  That is an unjust punishment.
[02:45:04.300 --> 02:45:05.460]  We're going to shut that down.
[02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:06.240]  I hope that happens.
[02:45:06.260 --> 02:45:08.421]  Well, Joe, I'm not going to keep you out there in the cold.
[02:45:08.461 --> 02:45:09.822]  I know it is incredibly cold.
[02:45:09.862 --> 02:45:11.602]  What is it, about 20 degrees out there right now?
[02:45:12.562 --> 02:45:13.663]  A little bit less than that.
[02:45:14.383 --> 02:45:17.604]  One of the spots we were at earlier was five degrees, so it's definitely chilly.
[02:45:18.687 --> 02:45:18.927]  Okay.
[02:45:18.947 --> 02:45:23.090]  And we don't have sweatpants or gloves or boots or anything.
[02:45:23.790 --> 02:45:24.891]  It's insanely cold there.
[02:45:24.911 --> 02:45:26.932]  Hopefully we'll get a chance to go get some of that stuff for tomorrow.
[02:45:27.192 --> 02:45:27.512]  Okay.
[02:45:27.753 --> 02:45:28.673]  It's insanely cold there.
[02:45:28.693 --> 02:45:33.316]  That's one of the reasons why I think, you know, a call for everybody to come to that area right at this, it's a bad timing.
[02:45:33.416 --> 02:45:34.297]  Just bad timing.
[02:45:34.917 --> 02:45:39.720]  Even if it wasn't somebody trying to get this aligned with Obama's gun grabs.
[02:45:39.760 --> 02:45:41.401]  I mean, it just doesn't make any sense to me.
[02:45:41.641 --> 02:45:42.301]  But thank you so much.
[02:45:42.361 --> 02:45:49.085]  It's important for us to get that message out that nothing violent is happening there right now so that nothing violent gets started on the side of the feds.
[02:45:49.105 --> 02:45:49.826]  Thank you so much, Joe.
[02:45:51.823 --> 02:45:55.505]  All right, that's Joe Biggs, our reporter on the ground there at the Oregon standoff.
[02:45:55.585 --> 02:45:59.128]  And as he pointed out, there is no violence going on there.
[02:45:59.148 --> 02:46:02.030]  Of course, that's what the mainstream media is trying to push this for.
[02:46:02.610 --> 02:46:06.593]  They want to stress the fact that these are armed yahoos.
[02:46:06.633 --> 02:46:08.954]  I think there was even a Twitter list.
[02:46:09.435 --> 02:46:14.018]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be on the next hour and he can talk about that, but I think it was in his article.
[02:46:14.943 --> 02:46:19.224]  There are some tweets out there, they're calling them Y'all-Qaeda, trying to turn them into terrorists.
[02:46:19.244 --> 02:46:19.544]  You know what?
[02:46:19.584 --> 02:46:21.145]  These people are not terrorists.
[02:46:21.765 --> 02:46:30.047]  You can look at the Hammonds and, if anything, I mean, they're not trying violence, they're not trying to intimidate people for political purposes.
[02:46:30.727 --> 02:46:32.608]  They're too apolitical, in my opinion.
[02:46:32.628 --> 02:46:34.849]  They don't understand how this affects them.
[02:46:34.869 --> 02:46:36.629]  They don't understand how it affects other people.
[02:46:36.669 --> 02:46:38.950]  They're too timid in terms of standing up for their rights.
[02:46:38.990 --> 02:46:39.530]  But nevertheless,
[02:46:40.350 --> 02:46:45.535]  That just makes it all the more the place that you don't have this kind of stand.
[02:46:46.016 --> 02:46:47.557]  What made the Bundy Ranch work?
[02:46:48.058 --> 02:46:49.539]  What made these other places work?
[02:46:49.639 --> 02:46:54.304]  People who are being oppressed, not given their due process, having their rights trampled on.
[02:46:54.344 --> 02:46:57.787]  We saw at the Bundy Ranch they had a First Amendment area.
[02:46:58.028 --> 02:46:59.069]  You know, it's not an area.
[02:46:59.089 --> 02:47:01.191]  The First Amendment is not an area.
[02:47:01.311 --> 02:47:01.791]  It's a right.
[02:47:02.512 --> 02:47:03.092]  They were doing that.
[02:47:03.132 --> 02:47:04.473]  They were attacking the people there.
[02:47:04.513 --> 02:47:05.713]  They were trying to steal their land.
[02:47:05.953 --> 02:47:06.714]  They asked for help.
[02:47:06.814 --> 02:47:08.374]  Their neighbors stood with them.
[02:47:09.195 --> 02:47:10.915]  People from the outside stood with them.
[02:47:11.455 --> 02:47:15.317]  They stood non-violently to get their property back and try to get their rights back.
[02:47:15.637 --> 02:47:20.459]  The problem is, these people in Oregon don't seem to know what their rights are.
[02:47:20.879 --> 02:47:23.300]  And they don't have the backbone to stand up for it.
[02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:26.581]  This is terrible miscarriage of justice.
[02:47:26.701 --> 02:47:28.362]  The judge himself said that.
[02:47:28.962 --> 02:47:35.585]  He says, I'm not supposed to use the word fairness in criminal law, but this is a sentence that shocks the conscience in me.
[02:47:36.145 --> 02:47:42.608]  It was actually an absolutely crazy sentence to have to give these people a five-year jail sentence.
[02:47:43.048 --> 02:47:45.309]  I think it was an outrage that they went to jail for three months.
[02:47:45.349 --> 02:47:50.411]  The elder Hyman went to jail for three months and the younger one went to jail for one year.
[02:47:50.431 --> 02:47:51.812]  I think that was an outrage.
[02:47:52.520 --> 02:47:57.843]  Because as we pointed out in the article from Kurt Nimmo, there have been multiple cases of doing the same thing.
[02:47:57.883 --> 02:48:00.084]  For management, having a fire.
[02:48:00.124 --> 02:48:09.109]  When you burn 139 acres out of 26,000 acres, that's less than a half of a percent of that land.
[02:48:09.129 --> 02:48:10.150]  That's a tiny amount.
[02:48:10.370 --> 02:48:14.392]  And in these two fires, the 2001 blaze burned 139 acres.
[02:48:14.432 --> 02:48:20.136]  The one in 2006, for which only Stephen was convicted, burned an additional acre of land.
[02:48:20.256 --> 02:48:20.616]  One acre!
[02:48:21.056 --> 02:48:22.017]  One acre out of 26,000.
[02:48:22.958 --> 02:48:25.560]  And the federal government wants to send people to prison.
[02:48:25.580 --> 02:48:29.643]  Meanwhile, they do their own so-called control burns, and they get out of control.
[02:48:29.683 --> 02:48:31.344]  They have destroyed livestock.
[02:48:31.384 --> 02:48:33.005]  They've destroyed other private property.
[02:48:33.065 --> 02:48:35.207]  They will not compensate anyone for that.
[02:48:35.247 --> 02:48:39.070]  But they will send you to jail, even though nothing happened with that.
[02:48:39.110 --> 02:48:40.811]  I want to go to some of the calls right now.
[02:48:40.852 --> 02:48:42.693]  Let's get your comments here.
[02:48:43.454 --> 02:48:46.036]  Paul in New Mexico, you wanted to comment on the Oregon situation.
[02:48:46.056 --> 02:48:46.296]  Go ahead.
[02:48:47.952 --> 02:48:56.520]  Yeah, I just want to say, you know how Spock from Star Trek would say, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
[02:48:57.401 --> 02:48:59.663]  I mean, that's not the case with this situation.
[02:48:59.723 --> 02:49:13.255]  We need to, they need to, I know we all have a livelihood, we all need to make money, we all need to put a roof over our head, but if at all possible, we need to out-think these globalists and
[02:49:14.191 --> 02:49:17.054]  Use our brains, don't let our emotions rule our brains.
[02:49:18.095 --> 02:49:19.777]  So that's basically what I have to say.
[02:49:20.037 --> 02:49:20.478]  I agree.
[02:49:20.558 --> 02:49:23.922]  I think we need to make common cause with people on a number of issues.
[02:49:23.942 --> 02:49:34.393]  I think one of the key things, Paul, is that people on the right don't seem to recognize the war on drugs for what it is, how it has destroyed our legal system, how it has destroyed
[02:49:34.873 --> 02:49:35.614]  Property rights.
[02:49:35.694 --> 02:49:38.055]  And I think they need to stand together.
[02:49:38.095 --> 02:49:41.718]  I think they need to stand together with the people who are opposing gun control.
[02:49:41.938 --> 02:49:43.939]  You know, we have people on the Second Amendment.
[02:49:43.959 --> 02:49:52.565]  They're very protective of their rights for the Second Amendment, but they don't protect people's rights when it comes to this out-of-control, illegal, unconstitutional war on drugs.
[02:49:52.845 --> 02:49:54.346]  We need to get a broader spectrum.
[02:49:54.366 --> 02:50:03.292]  We need to get people to come together who are, right now, compartmentalized on the left and compartmentalized on the right, between white and black, between city and rural.
[02:50:03.332 --> 02:50:04.373]  I mean, what do you think about that?
[02:50:07.374 --> 02:50:08.135]  Yeah, sure.
[02:50:08.215 --> 02:50:18.600]  Just, you know, the divide and conquer and stuff, you know, just like Alex says, you know, just using all these instigators and agitators.
[02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:21.462]  I just think, basically, that's all I have to say.
[02:50:21.742 --> 02:50:22.002]  I think
[02:50:22.816 --> 02:50:26.557]  We need to try to out-think these globalists, you know, and if at all possible.
[02:50:26.597 --> 02:50:31.579]  If at all possible, you know, just try to... I agree.
[02:50:32.059 --> 02:50:35.100]  Selfish, you know, about our individual needs and whatnot.
[02:50:35.180 --> 02:50:36.820]  So, that's all I've got to say.
[02:50:37.020 --> 02:50:37.401]  I agree.
[02:50:37.581 --> 02:50:37.921]  I agree.
[02:50:37.981 --> 02:50:39.041]  I know they're very frustrated.
[02:50:39.141 --> 02:50:40.321]  I know they've been through this before.
[02:50:40.341 --> 02:50:41.782]  I think one of the things that really struck a...
[02:50:42.382 --> 02:50:49.905]  A accord with the Bundys is probably this family is one of the last ranchers in this area.
[02:50:50.365 --> 02:50:51.706]  Read that in the Kurt Nimmo story.
[02:50:51.726 --> 02:50:56.388]  They got all the rest of the ranchers out and they're going to punish them just like they did the Bundys.
[02:50:56.448 --> 02:50:58.528]  I think that really resonated with them.
[02:50:58.548 --> 02:51:00.089]  When we come back, we're going to go to more of your calls.
[02:51:00.109 --> 02:51:00.569]  Stay with us.
[02:51:00.649 --> 02:51:01.850]  Anthony, Tim, and others.
[02:51:01.870 --> 02:51:02.450]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:09.244 --> 02:51:13.846]  Wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, a crashing economy.
[02:51:14.066 --> 02:51:14.946]  Are you ready?
[02:51:15.166 --> 02:51:17.827]  At best, your local stores have a three-day supply of food.
[02:51:17.947 --> 02:51:20.108]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?
[02:51:20.308 --> 02:51:23.790]  Are you willing to gamble your family's safety that it'll never happen to you?
[02:51:24.070 --> 02:51:28.852]  Be wise and be ready with 25-Year Shelf Life Wise Food Storage.
[02:51:29.172 --> 02:51:34.114]  Wise Food Storage provides affordable, ready-made gourmet meals with a super long 25-year shelf life.
[02:51:35.194 --> 02:51:35.554]  We're good.
[02:51:50.222 --> 02:51:52.944]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:52:13.198 --> 02:52:13.718]  It's true.
[02:52:13.839 --> 02:52:17.781]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:52:17.981 --> 02:52:19.842]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:52:20.383 --> 02:52:24.865]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:52:25.166 --> 02:52:33.671]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides,
[02:52:33.851 --> 02:52:37.776]  Bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.
[02:52:38.036 --> 02:52:41.580]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[02:52:41.840 --> 02:52:44.123]  The gold standard in water purification.
[02:52:44.484 --> 02:52:48.508]  And our filters last for years at less than two cents per gallon.
[02:52:48.809 --> 02:52:53.094]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[02:52:53.314 --> 02:52:54.895]  Get your Big Berkey today.
[02:52:55.055 --> 02:53:00.219]  Call 1-877-99-BERKEY or click BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[02:53:00.379 --> 02:53:04.162]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[02:53:04.442 --> 02:53:05.703]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[02:53:05.983 --> 02:53:07.864]  For the love of clean water.
[02:53:09.125 --> 02:53:11.807]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[02:53:11.867 --> 02:53:15.350]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[02:53:16.556 --> 02:53:19.718]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[02:53:20.038 --> 02:53:25.141]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[02:53:25.481 --> 02:53:26.702]  How is this even possible?
[02:53:26.982 --> 02:53:34.286]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[02:53:34.506 --> 02:53:41.930]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[02:53:42.150 --> 02:53:45.372]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[02:53:45.632 --> 02:53:53.056]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[02:53:53.456 --> 02:53:56.157]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[02:53:56.618 --> 02:54:00.680]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[02:54:00.740 --> 02:54:01.420]  That's Greens75.com.
[02:54:01.440 --> 02:54:01.840]  Greens75.com.
[02:54:16.007 --> 02:54:17.087]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:17.107 --> 02:54:19.088]  I'm David Nye, and we're going to go back to your calls.
[02:54:19.188 --> 02:54:23.770]  And for those of you that are on hold, I'll let you know that we're going to carry those forward to the next hour.
[02:54:23.810 --> 02:54:25.691]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us.
[02:54:25.791 --> 02:54:29.712]  I'll be taking calls in the first five-minute segment at the top of the hour.
[02:54:30.373 --> 02:54:33.154]  Let's go to Ted in Tennessee.
[02:54:33.214 --> 02:54:35.655]  Ted, this is a different topic than Oregon.
[02:54:35.775 --> 02:54:37.916]  You wanted to talk about self-driving cars that I brought up.
[02:54:37.956 --> 02:54:38.236]  Go ahead.
[02:54:38.916 --> 02:54:41.417]  Yes, about the self-driving cars.
[02:54:41.897 --> 02:54:43.358]  I have an organic cattle farm.
[02:54:43.578 --> 02:54:44.038]  I think
[02:54:44.690 --> 02:54:48.453]  It would be great to have those because I can't get anyone to work.
[02:54:49.855 --> 02:54:56.961]  So therefore, I can't leave the farm to go like to the co-op or to the hardware store or whatever.
[02:54:57.041 --> 02:55:02.686]  If I could send a car to go and pick the stuff up and bring it back, it would be great.
[02:55:04.062 --> 02:55:04.623]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:55:04.683 --> 02:55:05.023]  You know what?
[02:55:05.043 --> 02:55:06.505]  There's some really good uses for it.
[02:55:06.545 --> 02:55:12.011]  I mean, you can take your daily commute and instead of driving, you can sit there and tweet and play with Facebook.
[02:55:12.031 --> 02:55:13.172]  You can do a lot of things like that.
[02:55:13.212 --> 02:55:15.094]  I understand a lot of people don't want to drive.
[02:55:15.114 --> 02:55:18.478]  A lot of the people who are really pushing this really hard are not comfortable with cars.
[02:55:18.598 --> 02:55:19.879]  Here's my problem with it, Ted.
[02:55:20.740 --> 02:55:23.783]  The problem is that they're not going to allow you to have a choice, okay?
[02:55:23.923 --> 02:55:27.426]  Understand that they're going to gradually drive you out of the car.
[02:55:27.466 --> 02:55:37.494]  They're going to do that by saying if you're driving your car from a rural area where there isn't a network, and understand that, you know, you're looking at this from your organic cattle farm, those are going to be the last places that come online.
[02:55:37.514 --> 02:55:39.796]  This is going to be rolled out in the cities at first.
[02:55:40.356 --> 02:55:41.377]  But they're going to look at it.
[02:55:41.397 --> 02:55:43.037]  They're going to monitor the way that you drive.
[02:55:43.057 --> 02:55:48.720]  They're already bringing vehicle-to-vehicle communications being mandated by the Department of Transportation, Federal Department of Transportation.
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.981]  So that's an additional cost that you're going to be mandated to pay for.
[02:55:52.441 --> 02:55:56.143]  And then those V-to-V communications are going to be talking about you.
[02:55:56.163 --> 02:56:00.124]  They're going to be broadcasting everything about the way you drive, how fast you drive, where you drive.
[02:56:00.144 --> 02:56:01.425]  They're going to be monitoring everything.
[02:56:01.685 --> 02:56:03.646]  You're not going to have any privacy.
[02:56:03.666 --> 02:56:05.707]  They'll be able to shut down your car.
[02:56:06.607 --> 02:56:12.431]  If they don't like what you're doing, they'll be able to keep you from taking robot cars if they don't want you moving around.
[02:56:12.471 --> 02:56:26.118]  Just like they're restricting people's transportation right now with the TSA, saying that we're going to force you to get Real ID, force these states to recognize Real ID, or the people from these states aren't going to travel unless they get something like a passport.
[02:56:26.678 --> 02:56:27.779]  That's my concern about it.
[02:56:27.859 --> 02:56:29.520]  The fact that they're not going to give you a choice.
[02:56:29.540 --> 02:56:33.682]  The fact that they're going to use this to surveil you, to control your movement.
[02:56:33.702 --> 02:56:34.823]  Do you have a concern about that?
[02:56:35.936 --> 02:56:38.497]  No, because I don't leave the farm.
[02:56:38.797 --> 02:56:42.799]  I've had three days off in the last 18 years.
[02:56:43.300 --> 02:56:44.320]  Well, that's just it.
[02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:45.621]  That's the bottom line.
[02:56:46.081 --> 02:56:47.522]  You're not going to be able to leave the farm.
[02:56:47.562 --> 02:56:48.502]  It won't be your choice.
[02:56:48.542 --> 02:56:50.443]  But I understand where you're coming from.
[02:56:50.463 --> 02:56:52.184]  I want to have my freedom.
[02:56:52.244 --> 02:56:54.505]  I remember I see GM teaming up with Lyft.
[02:56:55.025 --> 02:56:58.107]  I grew up hearing the jingle, see the USA in a Chevrolet.
[02:56:58.567 --> 02:56:59.928]  Those of you who are old enough to do it.
[02:56:59.948 --> 02:57:02.269]  That was pushing the idea of freedom.
[02:57:02.369 --> 02:57:03.649]  That's what I think is important.
[02:57:03.669 --> 02:57:05.150]  The freedom to move about.
[02:57:05.410 --> 02:57:06.671]  That is a fundamental freedom.
[02:57:06.931 --> 02:57:12.473]  It was core to what I saw and appreciated about America in the middle of the 20th century.
[02:57:12.493 --> 02:57:14.314]  And I don't think it's something that we need to give up.
[02:57:14.874 --> 02:57:16.675]  Uh, for convenience or for anything else.
[02:57:16.695 --> 02:57:17.615]  That's what I'm concerned about.
[02:57:17.655 --> 02:57:26.259]  I've seen the government bureaucrats wanting public transportation just salivating over this for a very long time, and this is the way they're going to do it.
[02:57:26.299 --> 02:57:29.180]  Now, we're going to continue with your calls when we come back.
[02:57:29.400 --> 02:57:31.481]  Real quickly, I want to tell you one more time we've got
[02:57:32.461 --> 02:57:35.363]  Discounts across the board at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:57:35.483 --> 02:57:37.424]  We need you to support our operation.
[02:57:37.464 --> 02:57:39.105]  That's how we run this.
[02:57:39.125 --> 02:57:43.108]  And of course, we're offering discounts to help you at the same time.
[02:57:43.168 --> 02:57:44.309]  It's a win-win situation.
[02:57:44.329 --> 02:57:48.051]  Right now, you can get 15% off across the board at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:57:48.071 --> 02:57:49.312]  That's off of our health products.
[02:57:49.672 --> 02:57:52.374]  It's off of things that we sell like the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[02:57:52.734 --> 02:57:55.536]  Even off of things like the InfoWars solar-based
[02:57:56.196 --> 02:57:56.956]  Power station.
[02:57:57.096 --> 02:58:00.817]  That's a 1,500 watts of continuous power solar station.
[02:58:01.777 --> 02:58:04.318]  3,000 watts of peak power for any emergency.
[02:58:04.398 --> 02:58:07.598]  It will last up to eight times longer than a typical unit.
[02:58:07.638 --> 02:58:09.979]  This is a lithium iron phosphate battery.
[02:58:10.379 --> 02:58:15.059]  The price of solar cells has come down significantly in the last few years, but not the batteries.
[02:58:15.139 --> 02:58:17.320]  That's what separates one unit from the other.
[02:58:17.340 --> 02:58:23.321]  We have a great state-of-the-art battery in that, again, 15% off everything at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:23.681 --> 02:58:24.564]  Stay with us when we come back.
[02:58:24.584 --> 02:58:28.838]  We're going to go to more calls, most of them about what's happening in Oregon.
[02:58:28.878 --> 02:58:29.500]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:51.784 --> 02:58:55.753]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:58.962 --> 02:59:02.184]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:59:02.484 --> 02:59:10.509]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:59:10.729 --> 02:59:15.753]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:59:16.153 --> 02:59:18.434]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:59:18.674 --> 02:59:20.476]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[02:59:20.776 --> 02:59:24.978]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:59:28.955 --> 02:59:33.156]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[02:59:33.316 --> 02:59:37.297]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[02:59:37.477 --> 02:59:42.258]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[02:59:42.418 --> 02:59:46.939]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[02:59:47.079 --> 02:59:50.399]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:59:50.559 --> 02:59:53.860]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:54.020 --> 02:59:55.820]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:00:01.565 --> 03:00:12.611]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:13.391 --> 03:00:26.498]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:00:27.018 --> 03:00:29.280]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:30.635 --> 03:00:34.076]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:34.156 --> 03:00:34.737]  I'm David Knight.
[03:00:34.877 --> 03:00:36.958]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us from the UK.
[03:00:36.978 --> 03:00:39.078]  He'll be the host for the rest of the fourth hour.
[03:00:39.539 --> 03:00:41.179]  I've got some callers on the line.
[03:00:41.199 --> 03:00:46.141]  I wanted to get through as many of those as we could and see perhaps Paul will want to talk to them.
[03:00:46.441 --> 03:00:47.582]  We'll leave that decision up to him.
[03:00:47.802 --> 03:00:49.843]  Let's go to Anthony in Florida.
[03:00:49.863 --> 03:00:51.163]  He wanted to talk about the Oregon standoff.
[03:00:51.203 --> 03:00:52.064]  Go ahead, Anthony.
[03:00:53.144 --> 03:00:54.125]  Hello, yes.
[03:00:54.285 --> 03:00:55.105]  I'd like to say that
[03:00:56.397 --> 03:01:08.621]  I think it's important to take a step back, take a few steps back, and just observe what is going on, because that is, of course, the best way to go about it.
[03:01:09.161 --> 03:01:20.325]  And also that, like I've seen before, this is all part of the chessboard to basically try to make their moves on violating our rights.
[03:01:20.925 --> 03:01:23.026]  And I also would like to say that
[03:01:23.675 --> 03:01:30.337]  I got a great slogan that would look great on a billboard or whatever.
[03:01:30.457 --> 03:01:32.838]  Gun control is not the solution to the problem.
[03:01:33.038 --> 03:01:34.658]  Gun control is the problem.
[03:01:35.579 --> 03:01:35.979]  Absolutely.
[03:01:36.399 --> 03:01:38.119]  Gun control is not really about controlling guns.
[03:01:38.139 --> 03:01:39.200]  It's about controlling people.
[03:01:39.780 --> 03:01:43.001]  And that's why I was talking about self-driving cars in that context.
[03:01:43.041 --> 03:01:45.562]  Of course, you've got people like Ted I was just talking to.
[03:01:45.582 --> 03:01:47.242]  He said, hey, I don't ever leave the farm.
[03:01:47.522 --> 03:01:47.942]  I don't care.
[03:01:47.982 --> 03:01:50.083]  I just want to send this stuff out and not have to drive it.
[03:01:50.843 --> 03:01:53.384]  You know, you have to understand the broader issues involved.
[03:01:53.404 --> 03:01:59.485]  You have to understand how these things interconnect together, and you have to see the consequences of not being able to move.
[03:01:59.585 --> 03:02:05.726]  You know, it may be convenient under some circumstances, but in the bigger picture, that's going to be a very dangerous thing.
[03:02:05.766 --> 03:02:06.066]  I agree.
[03:02:06.086 --> 03:02:07.246]  We need to take a step back.
[03:02:07.626 --> 03:02:09.427]  We need to look at the overall context.
[03:02:09.447 --> 03:02:10.547]  Let's go to Tim in Wyoming.
[03:02:10.587 --> 03:02:11.767]  Tim, you want to talk about Oregon.
[03:02:11.787 --> 03:02:12.027]  Go ahead.
[03:02:21.024 --> 03:02:26.910]  The takeover of the building took place, and it was written for a newspaper in Oregon.
[03:02:27.811 --> 03:02:40.465]  Obviously, the extremely liberal reporter was saying that one of the spokespeople or one of the people who was speaking in relation to the situation said, she called the person, the reporter called the person
[03:02:43.246 --> 03:02:44.508]  A so-called patriot.
[03:02:44.528 --> 03:02:46.931]  I'm a member of the so-called patriot movement.
[03:02:47.311 --> 03:02:55.981]  And I thought to myself, well, that sounds like, I mean, not only are they saying that anybody who has the idea that patriotism is proper,
[03:02:59.518 --> 03:03:11.349]  They're being demonized, but not only that, they're trying to get the rest of the country, I mean, getting the rest of the country behind this and trying to say, like I said, this is a newspaper in Oregon where I read this.
[03:03:11.589 --> 03:03:18.196]  And I thought to myself, well, not only does it make the people look bad who are actually patriots, but
[03:03:19.045 --> 03:03:27.936]  The people that are there on the ground, this isn't part of what the article said, but I think that the people on the ground are making themselves out to be targets.
[03:03:28.016 --> 03:03:30.159]  I mean, you have to stand up for liberty.
[03:03:30.179 --> 03:03:31.501]  You have to stand up for what's right.
[03:03:31.521 --> 03:03:36.287]  You have to tell people, this is what I believe, this is what I will do, this is what you should do.
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:49.536]  And when people don't do that, when they don't stand up and say, this is how life should be, we should actually resist tyranny, we should tell the government they are our employees, not the other way around.
[03:03:49.556 --> 03:03:53.742]  Of course, when you do that, Tim, they're going to call you a sovereign citizen.
[03:03:54.002 --> 03:03:54.962]  One of their labels.
[03:03:55.022 --> 03:04:01.564]  And many people, I think even Cliven Bundy didn't realize when that label, they were trying to stick that label on him with the media.
[03:04:01.584 --> 03:04:03.445]  I think it was actually Glenn Beck that tried to do that.
[03:04:03.805 --> 03:04:06.966]  He didn't realize the full import of that term for law enforcement.
[03:04:07.026 --> 03:04:12.528]  That is a very specific term that means something very threatening to law enforcement.
[03:04:12.548 --> 03:04:18.050]  So if somebody wants to hang that label on you, I mean, I have no problem with citizens who are sovereign.
[03:04:18.630 --> 03:04:23.031]  Citizens who say that the government was created to protect my rights.
[03:04:23.452 --> 03:04:25.332]  The citizens are above the government.
[03:04:25.372 --> 03:04:26.533]  We are not its slaves.
[03:04:26.573 --> 03:04:31.574]  That's the basis of the founding principles of our government laid out in the Declaration of Independence.
[03:04:31.594 --> 03:04:37.056]  That we create governments to protect our individual liberties and when those governments become destructive of those liberties,
[03:04:37.356 --> 03:04:39.877]  It is our right and duty to alter or abolish it.
[03:04:40.197 --> 03:04:41.377]  I mean, that's the real key.
[03:04:41.637 --> 03:04:50.819]  But you say that, and they call you sovereign citizen, and they have drilled it into the police and law enforcement that sovereign citizens are people who are going to shoot them dead on sight.
[03:04:50.919 --> 03:04:54.520]  And so they've got their finger on the trigger if they see that label applied to you.
[03:04:54.580 --> 03:04:58.681]  It's very important that we look at these labels, and that's one of the reasons why we're there.
[03:04:58.721 --> 03:05:01.822]  We don't want to see them spin this in the wrong direction.
[03:05:02.282 --> 03:05:03.222]  Stay with us when we come back.
[03:05:03.282 --> 03:05:07.263]  Paul Joseph Watson will be hosting from the UK in the rest of the fourth hour.
[03:05:09.024 --> 03:05:18.586]  At least 20 armed militia members, including three members of the Bundy family, have seized control of a federal building at the Milor National Wildlife Refuge about 50 miles southeast of Burns, Oregon.
[03:05:18.886 --> 03:05:23.127]  The occupation is in response to the persecution of two Oregon ranchers, Dwight Hammond Jr.
[03:05:23.227 --> 03:05:23.987]  and Stephen Hammond,
[03:05:24.127 --> 03:05:27.409]  Who were convicted of a federal arson charge under an anti-terrorism law.
[03:05:27.629 --> 03:05:33.113]  In 2006, the Hammonds started a controlled burn to stop the spread of a lightning storm fire which threatened their ranch.
[03:05:33.273 --> 03:05:43.441]  The backfire saved their home and much of their property, but five years later the federal government, particularly the Bureau of Land Management, claimed the Hammonds were terrorists who started the fire to damage federally controlled land.
[03:05:43.581 --> 03:05:49.745]  The feds sent Dwight and Stephen to prison and are threatening to take their 12,000 acre property if they do not pay the BLM $200,000.
[03:05:51.306 --> 03:05:55.467]  InfoWars reporter Joe Biggs and other crew members will be on the scene giving live updates.

[03:08:12.381 --> 03:08:13.801]  We are on the march.
[03:08:14.161 --> 03:08:16.602]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:08:17.322 --> 03:08:21.063]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:21.963 --> 03:08:26.424]  We're back with Alex Jones Show 4.
[03:08:26.464 --> 03:08:28.905]  Hello, it's right with me, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:08:29.265 --> 03:08:31.125]  Now obviously we're talking about Oregon.
[03:08:31.145 --> 03:08:32.725]  We've been talking about it for the whole show.
[03:08:33.406 --> 03:08:39.747]  As you know by now, a group of individuals in defense of the Hammonds who are involved in a dispute with the federal government.
[03:08:40.492 --> 03:08:47.938]  Took over a remote building in the middle of nowhere in Oregon, which was completely empty and unoccupied.
[03:08:48.679 --> 03:08:50.320]  Took it over without force.
[03:08:50.901 --> 03:08:53.163]  No bloodshed, no violence whatsoever.
[03:08:54.004 --> 03:08:55.325]  And what was the hashtag?
[03:08:55.825 --> 03:09:13.534]  The leftists and social justice warriors chose to represent this news development on Sunday, the hashtag that was trending all day to describe this group of individuals taking over a building, an empty building in a remote area with no one there.
[03:09:13.914 --> 03:09:16.656]  The hashtag was Oregon under attack.
[03:09:18.467 --> 03:09:25.152]  Of course, you would think that Godzilla had arrived and was breathing fire, and literally it was the apocalypse.
[03:09:25.192 --> 03:09:29.314]  Of course, the entire state of Oregon was not under attack.
[03:09:29.875 --> 03:09:45.665]  It was a remote federal building, empty, in the middle of nowhere, but that's how leftists and social justice warriors framed it, because they have this racist obsession with declaring everything that white men do as terrorism.
[03:09:45.785 --> 03:09:48.307]  If you remember during the San Bernardino attacks,
[03:09:49.068 --> 03:09:54.078]  The first report said that it was potentially three white men involved in carrying out the attack.
[03:09:55.123 --> 03:10:02.008]  As soon as that became known on Twitter, it was, why isn't the media saying that this is white terrorist?
[03:10:02.028 --> 03:10:06.791]  This is obviously an act of domestic terrorism, and white people are responsible for it.
[03:10:07.191 --> 03:10:15.557]  Of course, then it slowly seeped out that the guy's name was Farooq, these were Islamic radicals, and it was like, move along, nothing to see here.
[03:10:15.917 --> 03:10:22.101]  And for days, they were talking about workplace violence, when it was obviously a jihadist-inspired attack.
[03:10:22.581 --> 03:10:24.523]  Of course, they lost all luster,
[03:10:25.203 --> 03:10:34.786]  For this feverish need, this feverish clamour to define everything as white terrorism when very few details were available in that case.
[03:10:34.806 --> 03:10:41.788]  But even with all the details available in this case, again, not a hostile takeover, no violence.
[03:10:42.289 --> 03:10:45.670]  The protesters themselves have said that they don't want any violence.
[03:10:46.390 --> 03:10:48.671]  Of course, if you look at the definition of terrorism,
[03:10:49.671 --> 03:10:51.831]  Which these people have no idea what it means.
[03:10:52.572 --> 03:10:56.933]  It's the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes.
[03:10:57.613 --> 03:11:00.033]  Again, no violence whatsoever.
[03:11:00.393 --> 03:11:01.193]  They took over.
[03:11:01.333 --> 03:11:02.354]  They trespassed.
[03:11:02.874 --> 03:11:05.314]  Is the summary of their crime so far.
[03:11:05.354 --> 03:11:07.335]  They trespassed into a government building.
[03:11:08.235 --> 03:11:08.675]  Empty.
[03:11:09.075 --> 03:11:10.075]  In the middle of nowhere.
[03:11:10.275 --> 03:11:13.796]  But according to the left, that's domestic terrorism.
[03:11:13.956 --> 03:11:15.316]  Because white people did it.
[03:11:15.356 --> 03:11:18.257]  Because the left is flagrantly racist.
[03:11:19.025 --> 03:11:24.729]  So they're complaining about the media not describing this as domestic terrorism, even though they now are.
[03:11:25.630 --> 03:11:35.217]  CNN reports, their own national security analyst, Juliet Kayyem, said there's no doubt the armed protesters in Oregon are domestic terrorists.
[03:11:35.997 --> 03:11:39.840]  They haven't committed an act of terror, nor are they threatening to, but they're domestic terrorists.
[03:11:40.420 --> 03:11:47.606]  Quote, simply because they are not Muslim jihadists does not mean they are authorized to threaten or use violence to support their political cause.
[03:11:48.286 --> 03:11:52.029]  Of course, they haven't used violence and they haven't threatened to use violence, but that doesn't matter.
[03:11:52.470 --> 03:11:54.331]  They're white, so they're domestic terrorists.
[03:11:54.852 --> 03:12:07.322]  So, despite the fact that the media, the leftist media, is now describing them as domestic terrorists in some quarters, the left is still irate that this isn't being described as white terrorism.
[03:12:08.003 --> 03:12:14.148]  In comparison to what happened in Ferguson and Baltimore with the Black Lives Matter uprising,
[03:12:15.149 --> 03:12:20.052]  Which, of course, the media described as a social justice movement.
[03:12:20.132 --> 03:12:27.937]  If you can pull up the Time Magazine article, Ferguson in defense of rioting is the headline.
[03:12:28.698 --> 03:12:40.765]  That's how the media treated scores of violent protesters setting fire to buildings, setting fire to vehicles, threatening police, looting stores there in Ferguson.
[03:12:41.246 --> 03:12:42.867]  That was a social justice movement.
[03:12:43.467 --> 03:12:46.309]  Burning down a city is progressive.
[03:12:46.890 --> 03:12:51.293]  Occupying a remote empty building in the middle of nowhere, that's terrorism.
[03:12:52.454 --> 03:12:55.717]  That's terrorism according to the left and the social justice warriors.
[03:12:56.658 --> 03:13:01.362]  So to see that trending on Twitter yesterday, I was responding to it in real time of course.
[03:13:02.382 --> 03:13:06.366]  And these were, this is an example of some of the comments that these leftists were making.
[03:13:07.276 --> 03:13:11.105]  One of them said, quote, did I miss the call for the National Guard in Oregon?
[03:13:11.426 --> 03:13:13.811]  I recall them in Ferguson and Baltimore.
[03:13:14.551 --> 03:13:21.553]  Well, the difference is, buildings weren't being burned down and looted left, right and centre in Oregon, OK?
[03:13:21.713 --> 03:13:23.234]  Oregon is not under attack.
[03:13:23.394 --> 03:13:26.235]  Godzilla has not landed and is not breathing fire.
[03:13:26.855 --> 03:13:28.595]  That's why the National Guard isn't there.
[03:13:29.056 --> 03:13:30.176]  I mean, listen to Joe Biggs.
[03:13:30.216 --> 03:13:32.457]  He just called me up in the last hour or so.
[03:13:32.697 --> 03:13:33.797]  There's nothing happening.
[03:13:34.157 --> 03:13:35.258]  There are no Feds there.
[03:13:35.538 --> 03:13:37.218]  There's one guy in a watchtower.
[03:13:37.778 --> 03:13:39.299]  And basically nothing's happening.
[03:13:39.679 --> 03:13:41.099]  Yes, you can call it criminal.
[03:13:41.139 --> 03:13:42.780]  Yes, you can call it trespassing.
[03:13:43.240 --> 03:13:45.542]  It's blatantly not domestic terrorism.
[03:13:45.942 --> 03:13:55.469]  If they had gone into a government building and killed two dozen people and then taken over the building in a hostile takeover, then yes, that would be domestic terrorism.
[03:13:56.209 --> 03:13:57.270]  That isn't the case.
[03:13:57.710 --> 03:14:06.957]  And as I tweeted, and CNN has included this in their article today, justified or not, it's a protest against government abuse of power.
[03:14:07.598 --> 03:14:11.781]  If Oregon is terrorism, then so is Black Lives Matter.
[03:14:12.541 --> 03:14:13.442]  Okay, that's all it is.
[03:14:13.503 --> 03:14:15.786]  Whether you agree with their grievance or not.
[03:14:16.547 --> 03:14:19.110]  And Alex has made the point that this seems rash.
[03:14:19.531 --> 03:14:20.873]  This seems misguided.
[03:14:21.293 --> 03:14:24.738]  The Oath Keepers have come out and said that they're not affiliated with it.
[03:14:25.058 --> 03:14:27.041]  The Hammond family aren't affiliated with it.
[03:14:27.901 --> 03:14:29.562]  And it doesn't seem like a good idea.
[03:14:30.123 --> 03:14:34.727]  But to claim that it's domestic terrorism is completely crazy.
[03:14:34.827 --> 03:14:35.407]  It's insane.
[03:14:35.908 --> 03:14:40.331]  Because if you say that this is domestic terrorism, then so is Black Lives Matter.
[03:14:40.872 --> 03:14:44.695]  And so then the leftists say, oh yes, but these people are armed.
[03:14:45.215 --> 03:14:47.357]  That proves that it's domestic terrorism.
[03:14:48.338 --> 03:14:54.503]  Well, if you go back to a headline on Infowars.com from back in March, armed black militants call for murder of cops.
[03:14:55.216 --> 03:15:06.001]  That's right, you had Black Lives Matter agitators walking down streets in Austin, armed with semi-automatic weapons, calling for the murder of cops.
[03:15:06.401 --> 03:15:09.743]  I don't see anyone in Oregon calling for the murder of cops.
[03:15:10.728 --> 03:15:12.790]  And again, I don't even agree with what they've done.
[03:15:12.830 --> 03:15:15.172]  It seems completely misguided, misdirected.
[03:15:15.192 --> 03:15:24.039]  The protesters who were initially there on the Saturday, they weren't fully informed about what they were planning, so it was kind of spontaneous.
[03:15:24.119 --> 03:15:26.021]  It wasn't well planned out, as they claim.
[03:15:26.906 --> 03:15:34.333]  But the leftists are saying this is an armed act of domestic terrorism and it's not comparable to Black Lives Matter because they were not armed.
[03:15:34.373 --> 03:15:35.374]  Well, they were armed.
[03:15:35.594 --> 03:15:43.521]  They were walking down the street in Austin chanting, the only good pig is a pig that's dead with semi-automatic rifles.
[03:15:44.302 --> 03:15:47.565]  Here's another report out of the Conservative Tribune.
[03:15:48.005 --> 03:15:51.409]  Armed gangs of Black Panthers are now openly patrolling neighbourhoods.
[03:15:52.298 --> 03:15:56.802]  The new Black Panther Party has been suspiciously silent about their unfortunate part in the Ferguson debacle.
[03:15:57.262 --> 03:16:03.567]  Thankfully for those of you following the zany antics of Eric Holder's favourite group of militants, they've popped up again.
[03:16:04.188 --> 03:16:13.875]  And it describes how they're marching down streets in Dallas, we had it in Austin and also now in Dallas, armed, calling for the murder of cops.
[03:16:14.796 --> 03:16:23.242]  Okay, that's more within the definition of domestic terrorism than anything that's happening in Oregon right now.
[03:16:23.622 --> 03:16:28.785]  But of course the left won't make that comparison because they're complete hypocrites and they're racists.
[03:16:29.146 --> 03:16:33.248]  They're obsessed with defining anything that white person does as terrorism.
[03:16:33.549 --> 03:16:38.132]  You don't judge whether it's terrorism or not based on a person's skin color.
[03:16:38.832 --> 03:16:41.215]  It's based on violence, it's based on motive.
[03:16:41.936 --> 03:16:42.957]  Okay, Dylan Roof.
[03:16:43.558 --> 03:16:45.000]  Did he have a political motive?
[03:16:45.020 --> 03:16:45.300]  Yes.
[03:16:45.360 --> 03:16:47.904]  Did he commit violence in pursuit of that political motive?
[03:16:47.944 --> 03:16:48.224]  Yes.
[03:16:48.604 --> 03:16:50.126]  He was a domestic terrorist.
[03:16:50.146 --> 03:16:50.827]  He was white.
[03:16:51.627 --> 03:16:54.168]  Okay, Farouk, the San Bernardino killer.
[03:16:54.429 --> 03:16:55.849]  Did he have a political motive?
[03:16:55.869 --> 03:16:56.249]  Yes.
[03:16:56.510 --> 03:16:58.991]  Did he commit violence in pursuit of that political motive?
[03:16:59.251 --> 03:16:59.591]  Yes.
[03:17:00.091 --> 03:17:00.812]  He was a Muslim.
[03:17:01.572 --> 03:17:03.213]  He was also a terrorist.
[03:17:03.793 --> 03:17:06.795]  You don't define a terrorist based on their skin colour.
[03:17:07.235 --> 03:17:14.039]  Again, this is the regressive left reverting back to their inherent racism time and time again.
[03:17:14.699 --> 03:17:17.882]  So if Oregon's domestic terrorism, then so is Black Lives Matter.
[03:17:18.342 --> 03:17:31.793]  The difference, of course, is that Black Lives Matter, their inspiration, whose name they chant on the streets at every Black Lives Matter protest, was actually a domestic terrorist!
[03:17:32.714 --> 03:17:36.416]  Assata Shakur, she was a convicted cop killer.
[03:17:36.717 --> 03:17:40.139]  She fled to Cuba, killed a cop in New Jersey before that.
[03:17:40.879 --> 03:17:44.342]  She's on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list.
[03:17:44.882 --> 03:17:55.129]  This is the inspiration, the foundational inspiration, that the originators of Black Lives Matter name as their ideological guru.
[03:17:55.409 --> 03:17:58.551]  And she's a domestic terrorist and a convicted cop killer.
[03:17:59.574 --> 03:18:06.556]  Of course you've had Black Lives Matter activists or agitators planning to bomb police stations in Ferguson.
[03:18:07.116 --> 03:18:17.500]  You had Ishmael Brinsley in New York at the turn of last year, December 2014, killing two cops on the streets of New York as part of what was later
[03:18:18.160 --> 03:18:22.061]  Discovered and confirmed to be a Black Lives Matter revenge attack.
[03:18:22.281 --> 03:18:24.302]  That was an act of domestic terrorism.
[03:18:24.802 --> 03:18:29.883]  The media didn't even report it as that at the time, but it was an act of domestic terrorism.
[03:18:30.143 --> 03:18:35.224]  So you've had Black Lives Matter supporters actually committing acts of domestic terrorism.
[03:18:35.785 --> 03:18:44.487]  You've got armed Black Lives Matter supporters walking down streets in Austin, walking down streets in Dallas, armed with semi-automatic rifles, calling
[03:18:45.447 --> 03:18:47.108]  For cops to be killed.
[03:18:47.749 --> 03:18:51.771]  And cops have already been killed by Black Lives Matter supporters.
[03:18:52.251 --> 03:18:54.133]  That is domestic terrorism.
[03:18:55.313 --> 03:19:00.777]  And again, if there's a massive standoff and there's a shooting war, then yes, that's a separate debate.
[03:19:01.377 --> 03:19:05.120]  But so far, in Oregon, you can't call it domestic terrorism.
[03:19:06.038 --> 03:19:12.601]  They're basically just occupying public property to protest against alleged abuses of power.
[03:19:13.461 --> 03:19:16.963]  So if you call that domestic terrorism, then what is Occupy Wall Street?
[03:19:17.830 --> 03:19:20.432]  That's also got to be defined as domestic terrorism.
[03:19:20.833 --> 03:19:32.142]  It was a group of protesters occupying public property, breaking laws to protest, whether justified or not, depending on your political viewpoint, against abuses of power.
[03:19:32.763 --> 03:19:36.846]  So if Oregon's domestic terrorism, Occupy Wall Street was domestic terrorism.
[03:19:37.066 --> 03:19:41.009]  But the regressive left won't tell you that because they're hypocrites and they're racists.
[03:19:42.102 --> 03:19:44.583]  The Mizzou protests a couple of months ago.
[03:19:44.963 --> 03:19:47.404]  The wave of protests across universities again.
[03:19:48.045 --> 03:19:52.167]  Occupying public property to protest against abuse of power.
[03:19:52.487 --> 03:19:54.588]  Was that domestic terrorism?
[03:19:54.648 --> 03:19:56.408]  No, they won't call it domestic terrorism.
[03:19:56.428 --> 03:20:01.691]  It's only domestic terrorism if white people are involved because the left are inherently racist.
[03:20:02.111 --> 03:20:05.773]  We'll be back with more news on the 4th Hour Overdrive on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:05.793 --> 03:20:06.333]  Stay tuned.

[03:22:15.653 --> 03:22:19.916]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.

[03:23:08.843 --> 03:23:12.025]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?

[03:24:04.827 --> 03:24:05.768]  FortressClothing.com
[03:24:22.639 --> 03:24:25.603]  The Backlight on the Alex Jones Show, 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:24:26.123 --> 03:24:31.650]  And CNN's top security analyst is saying that the Oregon situation is domestic terrorism.
[03:24:31.870 --> 03:24:34.653]  So occupying public property is now terrorism.
[03:24:34.753 --> 03:24:38.117]  Unless you're left-wing, then it's social justice.
[03:24:39.261 --> 03:24:40.402]  The Mizzou protest.
[03:24:40.682 --> 03:24:41.703]  Occupy Wall Street.
[03:24:41.783 --> 03:24:47.266]  Again, occupying public property to protest against abuses of power.
[03:24:47.866 --> 03:24:50.148]  The exact same situation in Oregon.
[03:24:50.688 --> 03:24:55.431]  And again, nobody's died, no buildings have been set on fire, nobody's been injured.
[03:24:55.791 --> 03:25:04.077]  In fact, there's a good meme which I tweeted earlier, comparing Black Lives Matter with Oregon under attack, which is what they chose to describe it as yesterday.
[03:25:04.857 --> 03:25:05.398]  Ferguson.
[03:25:06.638 --> 03:25:08.839]  12 civilian cars and 2 police cars destroyed.
[03:25:09.339 --> 03:25:10.640]  Hundreds of shots fired.
[03:25:10.660 --> 03:25:13.120]  25 businesses burned down.
[03:25:13.140 --> 03:25:14.421]  13 injuries.
[03:25:14.961 --> 03:25:15.321]  1 death.
[03:25:15.741 --> 03:25:17.582]  That was during the Ferguson riot.
[03:25:18.142 --> 03:25:19.643]  Baltimore.
[03:25:19.663 --> 03:25:21.323]  144 cars destroyed.
[03:25:21.343 --> 03:25:23.424]  60 buildings burned down.
[03:25:23.964 --> 03:25:26.565]  And again, most of these businesses are owned by black people.
[03:25:26.605 --> 03:25:28.086]  They were destroying their own community.
[03:25:29.366 --> 03:25:32.550]  60 buildings burned down, 130 cops injured.
[03:25:33.351 --> 03:25:34.733]  That was Ferguson and Baltimore.
[03:25:35.073 --> 03:25:36.054]  Compare that to Oregon.
[03:25:36.475 --> 03:25:44.986]  Zero injuries, zero deaths, zero property, businesses or cars destroyed, zero shots fired, zero police injured.
[03:25:45.286 --> 03:25:46.908]  Yeah, apparently according to the left.
[03:25:47.529 --> 03:25:56.375]  This is domestic terrorism, and now CNN's top security analyst is saying that it indeed is domestic terrorism.
[03:25:56.455 --> 03:25:59.697]  Again, complete hypocrisy from the left.
[03:25:59.777 --> 03:26:01.719]  They're obsessed with race-baiting.
[03:26:01.759 --> 03:26:09.123]  They're obsessed with describing anything, any act, political act whatsoever, carried out by white people as an act of terrorism.
[03:26:09.924 --> 03:26:13.046]  And their narrative is quickly beginning to melt.
[03:26:13.126 --> 03:26:16.829]  In fact, there's a whole host of memes comparing, for example,
[03:26:17.789 --> 03:26:24.192]  There's one that says, This picture was captured during white terrorist recent assault on the wildlife refugee gift shop.
[03:26:24.752 --> 03:26:28.134]  And it shows a scene of fire and war and bloodshed.
[03:26:28.174 --> 03:26:29.495]  Of course, nothing's happened.
[03:26:29.975 --> 03:26:33.617]  They occupied an empty remote building in the middle of nowhere.
[03:26:34.297 --> 03:26:35.377]  Again, misguided.
[03:26:35.958 --> 03:26:37.038]  Rash, you could say.
[03:26:37.518 --> 03:26:39.759]  But certainly not domestic terrorism.
[03:26:39.819 --> 03:26:44.442]  And anyone who claims that is clearly, completely erroneous.
[03:26:44.982 --> 03:26:46.803]  Let's move on to some of this other news now, though.
[03:26:47.887 --> 03:27:06.185]  New Year's Eve in Germany and Sweden, there was this rash of astounding stories, one of which came out of Cologne train station, and again this is the cultural enrichment that we're importing into the West via this migrant wave, and basically hardly any, in fact I haven't seen one,
[03:27:07.046 --> 03:27:10.708]  media report in English-language media about this, mainstream media.
[03:27:11.068 --> 03:27:13.390]  This is out of Breitbart.com.
[03:27:13.910 --> 03:27:21.555]  1,000 plus migrants brawl, rape, sexually assault and steal at one German train station on New Year's Eve.
[03:27:22.418 --> 03:27:35.414]  And you go through this story, we don't have time to go through it all, but dozens and dozens of examples of women being groped by lines of migrants, Turkish migrants in this Cologne train station.
[03:27:36.155 --> 03:27:37.977]  Stories of women being raped.
[03:27:38.678 --> 03:27:46.710]  Of course we know the rapes in and around migrant camps in Germany are being covered up by the police because they don't want to legitimize critics of mass migration.
[03:27:47.050 --> 03:27:54.942]  You've got Merkel working with Zuckerberg to censor anti-migrant posts on Facebook and basically they went nuts.
[03:27:55.462 --> 03:28:02.007]  On New Year's Eve in Germany, they were throwing fireworks at people, they were groping women, raping women.
[03:28:02.047 --> 03:28:04.990]  Of course, the feminists were completely silent about it.
[03:28:05.010 --> 03:28:09.053]  They're more concerned about sexist air conditioning and being triggered by clapping.
[03:28:09.413 --> 03:28:11.535]  Not a word, not a single word from them.
[03:28:12.195 --> 03:28:14.517]  Basically, these migrants went completely nuts.
[03:28:14.877 --> 03:28:17.419]  This is a long article, it goes through every example.
[03:28:17.980 --> 03:28:23.024]  These migrants were from North African and Arab countries, according to the police report.
[03:28:23.928 --> 03:28:25.050]  And they went insane.
[03:28:25.190 --> 03:28:30.019]  They went on a rampage at Cologne train station on New Year's Eve.
[03:28:30.400 --> 03:28:32.243]  Here's another story out of Sweden.
[03:28:33.348 --> 03:28:40.895]  In Kalmar, a group of newly-arrived asylum-seekers chose to celebrate New Year's Eve by sexually molesting young Swedish women.
[03:28:40.915 --> 03:28:57.069]  The newspaper 24 Kalmar reports, the gang made up of newly-arrived asylum-seeking men, age 25 to 30, went to Lantoga in central Kalmar, this Swedish town, where they started to surround young Swedish girls and began groping them.
[03:28:57.389 --> 03:29:00.511]  We also have this video out of Belgium, which we can play now.
[03:29:00.971 --> 03:29:04.614]  Teenagers set Christmas tree on fire in New Year's Eve Rampage.
[03:29:05.014 --> 03:29:12.679]  A video of teenagers lighting a petrol bomb under a Christmas tree, while yelling Allah Akbar to spark outrage in Belgium.
[03:29:12.719 --> 03:29:20.144]  The incident occurred in a square near the Clemenceau metro station in Anderlecht, in the Belgian capital Brussels, on New Year's Eve.
[03:29:20.745 --> 03:29:23.066]  So again, a number of incidents.
[03:29:23.106 --> 03:29:26.789]  We had another one in Germany, in Mönchengladbach,
[03:29:27.629 --> 03:29:33.532]  Bleak Christians, militant Muslim youth storm a Christmas service at a church in Mönchengladbach, Germany.
[03:29:34.172 --> 03:29:43.317]  Basically, they stormed the church, they interrupted the Christmas festival that was going on there, shouted expletives, rampaged through the church.
[03:29:43.917 --> 03:29:51.901]  Again, this is the cultural enrichment that we're importing to the West, and no one dares even talk about it because they've been told they were prosecuted.
[03:29:52.481 --> 03:29:53.763]  And denouncers hate criminals.
[03:29:53.803 --> 03:29:56.989]  We'll be back with more news on the Alex Jones Show 4-Hour Overdrive.
[03:29:57.029 --> 03:29:57.630]  Don't go away.
[03:29:58.371 --> 03:29:59.272]  We're on the march.
[03:29:59.753 --> 03:30:01.376]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.297 --> 03:30:04.982]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.467 --> 03:30:17.412]  In response to President Obama's plan to enact gun control through executive order, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said, come and take it.
[03:30:18.013 --> 03:30:21.776]  Abbott tweeted out, quote, Obama wants to impose more gun control.
[03:30:22.196 --> 03:30:23.897]  My response, come and take it.
[03:30:24.698 --> 03:30:31.764]  The president will meet with Attorney General Laurie Lynch to discuss what executive actions he's going to take to infringe the Second Amendment while bypassing Congress.
[03:30:32.464 --> 03:30:36.988]  The word is he's going to try and prevent people on the government's no-fly list from being able to purchase firearms.
[03:30:37.668 --> 03:30:47.154]  But, as we previously reported, thousands of law-abiding Americans have been wrongly placed on the no-fly list due to false information, clerical errors, or political persecution.
[03:30:47.975 --> 03:30:54.980]  In fact, it violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process by allowing the government to deprive people of their rights based only on suspicion.
[03:30:55.620 --> 03:31:00.904]  In other words, Obama wants to dictatorially restrict the Second Amendment rights of thousands of Americans.
[03:31:01.584 --> 03:31:03.966]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com.
[03:31:08.946 --> 03:31:10.548]  It has happened.
[03:31:10.568 --> 03:31:13.773]  2015 has passed into history, into lore.
[03:31:14.193 --> 03:31:16.997]  But now, 2016 has been born.
[03:31:17.017 --> 03:31:21.223]  And the decision lies in your hands to forge the destiny!
[03:31:23.746 --> 03:31:36.352]  That's a little too epic, that Hollywood action-adventure science-fiction voice I'm using, but quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when your body actually gets the real natural nutrients it needs.
[03:31:36.752 --> 03:31:43.176]  And that's why we're offering the biggest discount ever on three of our best-selling products that turbocharge and cleanse the body.

[03:32:02.426 --> 03:32:03.267]  I just did it again.
[03:32:03.347 --> 03:32:04.768]  I can't help but get excited.
[03:32:04.828 --> 03:32:05.468]  Get healthy!
[03:32:05.648 --> 03:32:06.449]  Fight the globalists!
[03:32:06.709 --> 03:32:07.309]  Win-win!
[03:32:07.529 --> 03:32:08.170]  Yeah!
[03:32:11.972 --> 03:32:21.354]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[03:32:21.694 --> 03:32:24.235]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[03:32:24.415 --> 03:32:27.775]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[03:32:27.956 --> 03:32:33.977]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[03:32:34.277 --> 03:32:39.118]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[03:32:39.418 --> 03:32:45.581]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[03:32:45.801 --> 03:32:53.285]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[03:32:53.545 --> 03:33:00.829]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[03:33:18.997 --> 03:33:27.421]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:28.341 --> 03:33:35.205]  Paul Joseph Watson, back live on the fourth hour overdrive of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:35.725 --> 03:33:38.126]  Before the break I talked about this Breitbart article.
[03:33:38.906 --> 03:33:45.269]  1,000 migrants basically went nuts in the German train station in Cologne, throwing fireworks at people.
[03:33:45.309 --> 03:33:46.150]  You can watch the video.
[03:33:46.690 --> 03:33:50.372]  Groping young women, raping women in some cases.
[03:33:50.692 --> 03:33:54.214]  Of course, it's in no English-language publication in the West.
[03:33:54.274 --> 03:33:56.095]  It's in a couple of German newspapers.
[03:33:56.655 --> 03:33:58.816]  None of the mainstream media will talk about it.
[03:33:59.277 --> 03:34:08.661]  You had a similar situation in Sweden, where a group of asylum seekers groped a bunch of young women again on New Year's Eve.
[03:34:08.681 --> 03:34:10.522]  That was their way of heralding the new year.
[03:34:10.722 --> 03:34:15.465]  That was their big celebration, to grope and rape a bunch of women, because they're tolerant, you know.
[03:34:15.985 --> 03:34:21.148]  Liberals won't call them out on it because they're not actual liberals and they've abandoned all their liberal principles.
[03:34:21.528 --> 03:34:24.049]  Feminists are too busy talking about sexist air conditioning.
[03:34:24.609 --> 03:34:25.370]  They don't give a damn.
[03:34:26.210 --> 03:34:29.712]  Over 800 cars were set ablaze in France on New Year's Eve.
[03:34:30.272 --> 03:34:38.757]  Again, probably not all Muslim migrants, but as you saw from the 2005 riots in Paris, that's one of their favoured
[03:34:39.960 --> 03:34:42.684]  ...forms of entertainment and set cars on fire.
[03:34:42.964 --> 03:34:48.231]  You had a church in Germany being raided and ransacked by militant Muslim migrants.
[03:34:48.952 --> 03:34:51.035]  That's not in English language media.
[03:34:51.496 --> 03:34:57.383]  You had teenagers in Belgium set fire to a Christmas tree and trapped Chan Allah Akbar.
[03:34:58.669 --> 03:35:05.234]  Again, because we've done such a good job at assimilating them into Western secular culture that they will do this.
[03:35:05.254 --> 03:35:08.936]  You had another case of them poshing a vehicle down a subway.
[03:35:08.996 --> 03:35:10.157]  I tweeted out that video.
[03:35:10.878 --> 03:35:11.778]  And then in Paris...
[03:35:12.830 --> 03:35:17.712]  And again, we say, oh, we let the terrorists win if we allow them to change our way of life.
[03:35:17.752 --> 03:35:27.175]  Well, in Paris, they have an annual celebration at the Champs-Élysées Arc de Triomphe, and I was there a few days ago, where they have a huge fireworks display on New Year's Eve.
[03:35:27.476 --> 03:35:32.517]  They cancelled it because of the threat, the threat from potential terror attacks.
[03:35:32.557 --> 03:35:36.559]  So again, allowing the terrorists to change our way of life.
[03:35:37.239 --> 03:35:38.640]  Letting the terrorists win.
[03:35:39.680 --> 03:35:48.451]  In Paris, they had bag searchers to get into restaurants, not to get into a government building or, you know, a major tourist destination.
[03:35:49.092 --> 03:35:51.635]  Just restaurants they were searching people's bags.
[03:35:51.675 --> 03:35:54.259]  Of course, these security guards were not armed.
[03:35:54.719 --> 03:36:00.921]  So if a pair of jihadists with semi-automatics wanted to shoot their way in, they could do so.
[03:36:01.241 --> 03:36:03.442]  So what is the point in searching people's bags?
[03:36:03.862 --> 03:36:07.903]  The terrorists aren't going to be all polite and say, oh yeah, have a look inside my rucksack.
[03:36:08.284 --> 03:36:08.984]  Here's a bomb.
[03:36:09.484 --> 03:36:10.084]  Here's a gun.
[03:36:10.124 --> 03:36:10.924]  They're not going to do that.
[03:36:10.964 --> 03:36:12.185]  They're just going to shoot their way in.
[03:36:12.845 --> 03:36:15.226]  All this terror theatre is exactly that.
[03:36:15.266 --> 03:36:16.467]  It's nonsense.
[03:36:17.167 --> 03:36:18.108]  Absolute nonsense.
[03:36:18.148 --> 03:36:35.396]  While they're allowing potential terrorists, unvetted, to flood in via the migrant wave, while ISIS brags about how they're exploiting it in their own manifesto to insert more jihadists into the West to carry out attacks, your stupid bag searches at restaurants aren't going to do anything to stop that.
[03:36:36.096 --> 03:36:37.557]  So again, it's security theatre.
[03:36:38.427 --> 03:36:40.849]  So you had migrants raping women, groping women.
[03:36:41.209 --> 03:36:42.630]  And what have the left said about it?
[03:36:42.690 --> 03:36:44.011]  What have feminists said about it?
[03:36:44.431 --> 03:36:47.573]  For months and months these rapes have been increasing at migrant centres.
[03:36:47.873 --> 03:36:51.476]  They've said absolutely nothing because they're not real liberals.
[03:36:51.716 --> 03:36:57.620]  They've abandoned their liberal principles and become part of the regressive left.
[03:36:57.700 --> 03:37:03.364]  And I just put out a video on YouTube a couple of hours ago about the regressive left, breaking it down.
[03:37:03.784 --> 03:37:05.345]  So now we're going to go to that video.
[03:37:05.385 --> 03:37:05.806]  Here it is.
[03:37:06.877 --> 03:37:17.481]  Regressive leftists are self-proclaimed liberals who abandon liberal principles by tolerating and defending non-liberal ideologies.
[03:37:17.601 --> 03:37:26.304]  When right-wing Christian fundamentalists like the Westboro Baptist Church espouse hatred for gays, adulterers, and anyone who rejects their God,
[03:37:26.724 --> 03:37:29.045]  Progressives react with scorn.
[03:37:29.325 --> 03:37:33.906]  They chastise such beliefs for being outdated, intolerant, and dangerous.
[03:37:34.287 --> 03:37:35.127]  And rightly so.
[03:37:35.267 --> 03:37:48.472]  Yet when Muslims espouse the very same beliefs, self-proclaimed liberals suddenly lose all their liberal convictions and either remain silent or viciously attack critics of Islam.
[03:37:48.512 --> 03:37:55.474]  They contradict their own liberal values by acting as apologists for illiberal ideas.
[03:37:55.734 --> 03:38:05.985]  Remember, polls show that the clear majority of Muslims in numerous Middle Eastern countries support stoning women to death and killing people who leave the religion of Islam.
[03:38:06.025 --> 03:38:09.688]  Last time I checked, those weren't liberal principles!
[03:38:09.949 --> 03:38:10.910]  Oh, that's their culture.
[03:38:10.930 --> 03:38:11.831]  You have to respect it.
[03:38:11.871 --> 03:38:12.531]  That's right.
[03:38:12.651 --> 03:38:13.432]  That's what they say.
[03:38:13.492 --> 03:38:14.553]  It's just insane.
[03:38:14.593 --> 03:38:15.675]  It's just the one exception.
[03:38:16.215 --> 03:38:19.839]  So why do self-proclaimed liberals act as apologists for the illiberal religion of Islam?
[03:38:19.859 --> 03:38:22.382]  Let's take a look at a few examples.
[03:38:31.192 --> 03:38:41.801]  The left-wing group Hope Not Hate, which describes itself as anti-fascist, recently compiled a list of anti-Muslim bigots.
[03:38:41.981 --> 03:38:53.751]  This list of anti-Muslim bigots included Raquel Saraswati, a headscarf-wearing, devout Muslim who campaigns against honour violence.
[03:38:54.031 --> 03:39:06.154]  In Pakistan alone, 1,000 women are executed every single year for honour crimes that include wearing jeans, looking at a man twice, or singing.
[03:39:06.394 --> 03:39:16.217]  So this left-wing supposedly anti-bigotry organisation actually listed a devout Muslim as an anti-Muslim bigot.
[03:39:16.937 --> 03:39:18.919]  Simply for drawing attention to this.
[03:39:19.119 --> 03:39:30.191]  The list also included Ayaan Hirsi Ali, an ex-Muslim who has dedicated her life to pushing for a reform of Islam to make it more tolerant and more in line with liberal principles.
[03:39:30.391 --> 03:39:33.335]  Hirsi Ali had previously appeared on another list.
[03:39:33.795 --> 03:39:42.163]  That of Islamist jihadist who murdered her colleague on the streets of Amsterdam in 2004 and promised that she was next.
[03:39:42.303 --> 03:39:47.788]  Hope Not Hate says its goal is to, quote, undermine groups that preach hate, intolerance and division.
[03:39:48.268 --> 03:39:56.196]  But in smearing these people amongst numerous other reformists, they are supporting a belief system which promotes hate.
[03:39:56.596 --> 03:39:58.136]  Intolerance and division.
[03:39:58.176 --> 03:40:03.878]  This flagrant hypocrisy is a defining characteristic of the regressive left.
[03:40:04.498 --> 03:40:05.858]  Okay, but think about it.
[03:40:05.878 --> 03:40:07.919]  And you don't do it by saying to them Muslims are bad.
[03:40:08.139 --> 03:40:09.579]  But you're not saying Muslims are bad.
[03:40:09.599 --> 03:40:10.560]  You are saying that.
[03:40:10.760 --> 03:40:13.240]  We're saying the ideas need to be changed.
[03:40:13.260 --> 03:40:14.621]  You're saying their ideas are bad?
[03:40:17.481 --> 03:40:20.463]  Killing women for being raped, I would say, is a bad idea.
[03:40:20.483 --> 03:40:22.645]  Yeah, I do.
[03:40:23.546 --> 03:40:24.367]  Hang me for it.
[03:40:24.547 --> 03:40:39.499]  And given that leftist groups have aligned philosophically with Islamists in identifying reformists and critics of Islam as the enemy, it's unsurprising that jihadists see this as an opportunity.
[03:40:39.619 --> 03:40:41.020]  In its recent manifesto,
[03:40:41.740 --> 03:40:54.434]  ISIS discussed how their operatives in Europe would seek to recruit, radicalise and arm left-wing activists because they broadly share the same political goals.
[03:40:54.694 --> 03:41:01.081]  So you've got adherence of ISIS which promotes the most intolerant, hateful and violent belief system.
[03:41:01.761 --> 03:41:07.684]  Actually reaching out to leftists because they see them as philosophical bedfellows.
[03:41:07.984 --> 03:41:12.427]  Glenn Greenwald is another example of a regressive leftist.
[03:41:12.627 --> 03:41:26.935]  After doing sterling work exposing NSA surveillance via the Edward Snowden leaks, Greenwald now appears to spend most of his time trying to smear the new atheists, most recently Richard Dawkins, because they're critical of Islam.
[03:41:27.395 --> 03:41:34.698]  Despite the fact that Greenwald, as a gay man, would be executed in many Muslim countries.
[03:41:34.898 --> 03:41:51.366]  Despite claiming that he's a champion of free speech, Greenwald responded to the jihadist slaughter of Charlie Hebdo cartoonists and staff by attacking the publication itself, labelling it offensive and bigoted towards Muslims.
[03:41:51.726 --> 03:41:54.347]  Even though Charlie Hebdo was notorious
[03:41:54.727 --> 03:41:59.429]  for its eagerness to offend both Jews and Christians in equal measure.
[03:41:59.529 --> 03:42:07.872]  In a Twitter exchange with me, Greenwald suggested that his love of free speech was so strident that he would even defend Nazis.
[03:42:08.092 --> 03:42:17.916]  But when I challenged him to defend Donald Trump's free speech rights after his controversial comments on Muslim immigration, Greenwald went completely silent.
[03:42:18.036 --> 03:42:19.177]  Regressive leftists
[03:42:19.637 --> 03:42:25.302]  ...are only prepared to defend the free speech rights of those with whom they agree.
[03:42:25.382 --> 03:42:35.951]  Given the choice between being politically correct or standing by their principles, regressive leftists will choose the former every single time.
[03:42:36.031 --> 03:42:43.397]  But Greenwald doubled down on his regressivism, later retweeting an ISIS supporter
[03:42:43.737 --> 03:42:51.482]  who once advocated killing homosexuals to endorse his argument during an exchange with Majid Nawaz.
[03:42:51.562 --> 03:42:54.784]  This is a defining characteristic of the regressive left.
[03:42:55.205 --> 03:43:01.069]  They will even side with people who would literally execute them in cold blood!
[03:43:01.929 --> 03:43:05.772]  Rather than criticise the intolerant aspects of Islam.
[03:43:05.832 --> 03:43:08.774]  Then we have another example of a regressive leftist.
[03:43:09.194 --> 03:43:16.659]  Former Russia Today host Abby Martin, who now presents a show on a network funded by Venezuela's communist government.
[03:43:16.779 --> 03:43:25.766]  When I drew attention to Martin's ludicrous suggestion that the San Bernardino attacks had nothing to do with Islam, labelling her a regressive leftist,
[03:43:26.346 --> 03:43:36.037]  Martin shot back by claiming that anyone who used the term regressive left was merely covering for their, quote, irrational fear of Muslims.
[03:43:36.257 --> 03:43:42.664]  Unfortunately for Abbie, the term regressive left was coined by Majid Nawaz.
[03:43:43.445 --> 03:43:44.065]  A Muslim!
[03:43:44.406 --> 03:43:48.568]  You realize you just epitomized the very reason I coined the term.
[03:43:48.969 --> 03:43:50.490]  Yours, a Muslim.
[03:43:51.190 --> 03:43:52.251]  Responded Noas.
[03:43:52.391 --> 03:44:07.000]  In addition, Martin's claim that people like me who use the term regressive left are just absolving their support for the empire is completely debunked by the fact that I've opposed every single war in the Middle East.
[03:44:07.120 --> 03:44:11.523]  So again, Martin exhibited one of the defining characteristics
[03:44:11.943 --> 03:44:12.283]  Of course not.
[03:44:27.697 --> 03:44:31.279]  Are themselves engaging in a form of bigotry.
[03:44:31.359 --> 03:44:34.061]  The bigotry of low expectations.
[03:44:34.461 --> 03:44:47.290]  Offering themselves up as human shields to defend Islam because of the assumption that Muslims are somehow incapable of handling criticism or debate without becoming violent or feeling persecuted.
[03:44:47.550 --> 03:44:50.772]  The regressive left has also formed an unspoken alliance
[03:44:51.112 --> 03:45:00.659]  With anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists who claim that every single act of Islamist terror is staged by the CIA or Mossad.
[03:45:00.719 --> 03:45:08.204]  Muslim immigrants living in the West also routinely spout the same conspiracies to try and absolve Islam of blame.
[03:45:21.305 --> 03:45:32.473]  While governments have staged individual acts of false flag terror throughout history, to claim that every Muslim massacre is the work of US or Israeli intelligence is both lazy
[03:45:32.973 --> 03:45:39.199]  And an intellectually dishonest ploy to make excuses for violent Islamism.
[03:45:39.239 --> 03:45:52.653]  This again underscores why so many on the left will resort to unprecedented levels of self-delusion so long as it allows them to stick their heads in the sand and deny that there's a problem with Islam.
[03:45:52.733 --> 03:45:56.396]  The fact of the matter is that you either oppose religious dictatorship
[03:45:57.133 --> 03:46:11.085]  And it's terrorist surrogates everywhere, without distinction, whether it's messianic settlers on the West Bank, or Christian nutbags trying to teach us that we trod the earth the same time as the dinosaurs, or the forces of jihad.
[03:46:11.105 --> 03:46:13.667]  You either oppose this kind of thing root and branch, or you don't.
[03:46:14.588 --> 03:46:17.491]  And I'm sorry to say that the anti-war left has failed the test.
[03:46:17.552 --> 03:46:21.556]  It has made excuses for our totalitarian and theocratic enemies.
[03:46:21.636 --> 03:46:27.122]  Another hotbed of leftist regressivism can be found amongst western feminists.
[03:46:27.262 --> 03:46:32.408]  While screeching endlessly about a college rape culture that doesn't exist,
[03:46:33.089 --> 03:46:40.215]  Feminists have been completely silent on the very real rape culture that the West is importing.
[03:46:40.296 --> 03:46:52.046]  Muslim migrants pouring into European countries are used to treating women as second-class citizens because Islam is a highly misogynistic and patriarchal religion.
[03:46:52.126 --> 03:46:57.271]  That's why rapes and sexual assaults of women in and around migrant camps
[03:46:57.671 --> 03:46:58.531]  Or exploding.
[03:46:58.571 --> 03:47:11.596]  But instead of drawing attention to the need to stem the tide, or in the very least assimilate these migrants into embracing and adopting Western values on how to treat women, what do we hear from feminists?
[03:47:11.736 --> 03:47:20.278]  They're too busy whining about the evils of sexist air conditioning being triggered by clapping and beach body advertisements.
[03:47:20.438 --> 03:47:21.819]  Listen, it comes down to this.
[03:47:22.139 --> 03:47:25.120]  It doesn't matter if you call yourself a liberal.
[03:47:25.180 --> 03:47:38.123]  The fact that you constantly defend, make excuses for, and refuse to critique the most illiberal doctrine on the planet, Islam, proves that you're not a liberal.
[03:47:38.183 --> 03:47:46.926]  You're a regressive leftist who is perfectly willing to betray your supposedly ardent principles in a heartbeat.
[03:47:47.566 --> 03:48:02.183]  Rather than dare to offend a minority group, even when that minority group holds beliefs that are flagrantly bigoted, extremist and completely contradictory to true liberal values.
[03:48:02.323 --> 03:48:03.644]  And here's why it matters.
[03:48:03.845 --> 03:48:08.210]  The almost complete absence of powerful voices on the left
[03:48:08.670 --> 03:48:13.312]  To denounce the intolerant aspects of Islam has created a vacuum.
[03:48:13.412 --> 03:48:21.636]  That vacuum has been filled by actual extremists, racists and Islamophobes on the far right.
[03:48:21.797 --> 03:48:24.498]  The regressive left's failure to criticise Islam.
[03:48:24.818 --> 03:48:34.748]  has amplified the voices of neo-Nazis, Christian fundamentalists, white supremacists, and actual bigots who just hate Muslims.
[03:48:34.868 --> 03:48:41.234]  That polarization has in turn attracted more Muslims to the extremist message of Islamists.
[03:48:41.415 --> 03:48:47.681]  So in failing to stand up for liberal principles, regressive leftists have ensured
[03:48:48.061 --> 03:48:53.884]  that the dialogue will continue to be dominated by extremists on both sides.
[03:48:54.044 --> 03:49:06.090]  Regressive leftists are trying to strangle moderate voices by denouncing them as intolerant bigots, while condoning the actual intolerance implicit within Islam.
[03:49:06.150 --> 03:49:14.714]  This will lead to a less tolerant society, resulting in more hatred, more racism, more polarisation,
[03:49:15.254 --> 03:49:21.185]  More clampdowns on free speech and less secular liberalism.
[03:49:23.058 --> 03:49:26.659]  Okay, that's a video up on YouTube, the truth about the regressive left.
[03:49:26.719 --> 03:49:27.940]  Please get that, share it.
[03:49:28.700 --> 03:49:50.669]  It's important because the regressive left, which is mainly white middle-class liberals who think they represent all minority groups, are actually strangling the voices of the Muslim and ex-Muslim reformists, people like Majid Nawaz and Hirsi Ali, who are trying to reform Islam to make it more compatible with liberal principles.
[03:49:51.249 --> 03:49:58.871]  So these so-called liberals have completely abandoned those principles because of the terror of being described as politically incorrect.
[03:49:59.212 --> 03:50:07.334]  And now you have ISIS saying they're going to reach out to these regressive liberals and try and arm them and radicalize them because they share the same beliefs.
[03:50:07.654 --> 03:50:09.735]  Then you have stories like this out of France again.
[03:50:10.535 --> 03:50:15.857]  Muslim screaming Allah Akbar runs over soldier in France wanted to be a martyr.
[03:50:16.457 --> 03:50:26.085]  A 29-year-old man who tried to run down soldiers guarding a French mosque, they were guarding a mosque, said he wanted to kill them and be killed himself to appear like a martyr.
[03:50:26.426 --> 03:50:28.387]  He also injured another Muslim.
[03:50:28.828 --> 03:50:29.628]  So that's the point.
[03:50:29.969 --> 03:50:36.975]  You have jihadists who seek to use violence to impose Islam on the rest of the world, but you also have Islamists
[03:50:37.475 --> 03:50:46.998]  Who seek to do the same thing, seek to impose Islam with all its regressivism, all its intolerance, all its abuse of women and minorities through political means.
[03:50:47.319 --> 03:50:56.942]  And the regressive left are acting as cover, running defense for those intolerant and illiberal individuals and ideologies.
[03:50:57.222 --> 03:50:59.988]  And it poses a huge threat to free speech at the same time.
[03:51:00.048 --> 03:51:01.330]  So that's why it's important.
[03:51:01.611 --> 03:51:02.813]  So please get out that video.
[03:51:03.154 --> 03:51:04.116]  Share it on YouTube.
[03:51:04.156 --> 03:51:04.737]  We'll be back.
[03:51:04.817 --> 03:51:06.741]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show live.
[03:51:06.841 --> 03:51:08.083]  Infowars.com.
[03:51:08.123 --> 03:51:08.644]  Stay tuned.
[03:51:10.051 --> 03:51:18.074]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:18.754 --> 03:51:19.474]  What did I do?
[03:51:20.234 --> 03:51:27.537]  I created Extendivite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.
[03:51:28.157 --> 03:51:36.580]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you, so you don't have to suffer the same thing I did.
[03:51:37.120 --> 03:51:41.564]  Clean your blocked arteries and strengthen your heart and boost your natural immune system.
[03:51:42.305 --> 03:51:45.668]  I'm 60 years old now and I still work every day.
[03:51:45.968 --> 03:51:47.649]  To get your Xtendivite, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:47.830 --> 03:51:48.830]  That's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:51:48.850 --> 03:51:51.873]  Xtendivite is only $69.95 for a 2-month supply of either capsules or liquid.
[03:52:09.070 --> 03:52:17.894]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[03:52:18.094 --> 03:52:24.397]  And it's all possible because in the hustle and bustle of daily life, we forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[03:52:24.597 --> 03:52:26.138]  The numbers are staggering.
[03:52:26.298 --> 03:52:32.861]  In the past five years alone, $41 billion of consumer gift cards went completely unspent.
[03:52:33.021 --> 03:52:36.263]  That's $41 billion taken directly from our back pockets.
[03:52:36.544 --> 03:52:37.624]  Don't let them win.
[03:52:37.925 --> 03:52:47.392]  Instead, use your gift cards to help support the InfoWar and get 15% off when you use the promo code GIFT15 at checkout at InfoWarStore.com.

[03:55:12.701 --> 03:55:15.282]  That's why your support is crucial.
[03:55:15.683 --> 03:55:22.528]  But talking about the regressive left here in the final few minutes, Twitter is the home of the regressive left.
[03:55:22.908 --> 03:55:34.537]  And the more these internet ghettos, as Drudge called them, the more our internet content gets segregated into these ghettos, the more, the bigger a threat censorship poses.
[03:55:35.017 --> 03:55:37.298]  And now there's an article out of National Review Online.
[03:55:37.718 --> 03:55:39.359]  Islam versus free speech.
[03:55:39.699 --> 03:55:41.300]  Twitter surrenders.
[03:55:41.700 --> 03:55:44.621]  Listen to the new policy that Twitter is about to impose.
[03:55:44.641 --> 03:55:46.082]  In fact, already is imposing.
[03:55:47.162 --> 03:55:49.383]  It's clamping down on, quote, hate speech.
[03:55:49.423 --> 03:55:52.385]  But wait until you find out their definition of hate speech.
[03:55:52.925 --> 03:55:54.386]  This is the policy from Twitter.
[03:55:55.086 --> 03:56:01.709]  Quote, Twitter prohibits the promotion of hate content, sensitive topics, and violence globally.
[03:56:02.449 --> 03:56:07.151]  So again, as the article points out, we're not talking about the incitement of violence.
[03:56:07.171 --> 03:56:08.691]  We're not just talking about that.
[03:56:09.031 --> 03:56:17.034]  We're talking about Twitter laying the groundwork to regulate discussion of any topic it deems sensitive.
[03:56:17.814 --> 03:56:20.076]  Again, from Twitter's new policy.
[03:56:20.417 --> 03:56:37.794]  Quote, hate speech or advocacy against an individual, organisation or protected group based on race, ethnicity, national origin, colour, religion, disability, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status or other protected status.
[03:56:38.835 --> 03:56:39.515]  Translation,
[03:56:40.680 --> 03:56:51.245]  Advocacy against religion is now going to be monitored and potentially censored under Twitter's new hate speech policy.
[03:56:51.685 --> 03:56:54.546]  Again, has nothing to do with hate speech.
[03:56:54.866 --> 03:57:02.370]  This is about, as the article states, banning advocacy against people or groups based on, among other things, religion.
[03:57:03.766 --> 03:57:07.108]  This is about censoring criticism of Islam.
[03:57:07.528 --> 03:57:21.315]  So isn't it interesting that while Twitter just imposed that policy, you only have to go back a matter of three months for this headline, meet Twitter's second biggest shareholder, Saudi Prince Ali Bin Talal.
[03:57:21.635 --> 03:57:28.299]  Saudi billionaire Prince, famous for employing a team of dwarves, is now Twitter's second largest shareholder.
[03:57:28.979 --> 03:57:30.720]  So now he's got a stake in Twitter.
[03:57:31.080 --> 03:57:45.991]  Weeks later, they impose censorship policies where they're potentially going to be censoring and regulating discussion of quote sensitive topics and criticism of religion, including criticism of Islam.
[03:57:46.391 --> 03:57:51.695]  Again, mirroring Facebook's policy imposed by Zuckerberg in league with Angela Merkel,
[03:57:52.375 --> 03:57:57.777]  Where criticism of migrants can be deemed racist and people can be prosecuted for that.
[03:57:58.157 --> 03:58:02.539]  Of course, you don't even have to make racist or violent comments to be affected by that.
[03:58:02.959 --> 03:58:17.664]  The mere knowledge that they're monitoring your free speech when it comes to this migrant crisis will make you less likely to criticize the policy, even if you're not making violent or hateful comments, because it has the effect of chilling good speech.
[03:58:18.144 --> 03:58:19.506]  Now Twitter's talking about it.
[03:58:19.806 --> 03:58:24.111]  You have feminists going to the UN and saying that ISPs should impose these same rules.
