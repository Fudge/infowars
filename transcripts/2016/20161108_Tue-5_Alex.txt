[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.450]  We fight the Globals!
[00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.231]  We fight the New World Order!
[00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.115]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:00:19.555 --> 00:00:27.200]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.562]  As president, I will make it clear.
[00:00:30.442 --> 00:00:35.186]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[00:00:35.747 --> 00:00:41.132]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[00:00:41.172 --> 00:00:44.495]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:47.517]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[00:00:47.597 --> 00:00:50.160]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.555]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:58.160]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:06.492]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:08.882]  The U.S.
[00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:12.525]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:20.510]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:23.192]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[00:01:23.212 --> 00:01:27.335]  Of course not, because she's... Hang on guys, look, there's a really loud noise.
[00:01:27.915 --> 00:01:31.958]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[00:01:31.998 --> 00:01:34.200]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[00:01:38.058 --> 00:01:42.456]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:14.138]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:02:14.378 --> 00:02:15.718]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:19.499]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.

[00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:32.582]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:02:32.743 --> 00:02:38.224]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[00:02:38.564 --> 00:02:46.108]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[00:02:46.348 --> 00:02:50.791]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:59.916]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:03.338]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[00:03:12.854 --> 00:03:16.256]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:03:16.617 --> 00:03:23.741]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:03:24.362 --> 00:03:32.727]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:03:32.988 --> 00:03:37.070]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:42.534]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:03:42.574 --> 00:03:42.854]  I'm good.
[00:04:11.331 --> 00:04:13.754]  They said in October I'd be dead in six months.
[00:04:15.716 --> 00:04:20.060]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:30.151]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:32.474]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:39.466]  The intervention led by NATO to topple Gaddafi has led to a failed state.
[00:04:44.227 --> 00:04:51.249]  Maybe Libya was not perfect under Gaddafi, but it had, even if to some extent, a functioning government, one unified country.
[00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:52.849]  It was a sovereign state.
[00:04:54.349 --> 00:05:01.091]  Libya now has two rival governments, a civil war that has left over 4,000 people dead, and its cities are in ruin.
[00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:01.791]  I don't know.
[00:05:02.811 --> 00:05:07.852]  What happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be?
[00:05:08.172 --> 00:05:12.634]  Women are treated discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[00:05:12.974 --> 00:05:16.455]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[00:05:16.535 --> 00:05:17.415]  They're mistreated.
[00:05:18.095 --> 00:05:19.455]  She claims to be their champion.
[00:05:19.756 --> 00:05:20.676]  We led ISIS!
[00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:22.677]  Take this position.
[00:05:23.337 --> 00:05:29.182]  It was Hillary Clinton that she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS.
[00:05:29.482 --> 00:05:40.971]  We had this brilliant idea that we were going to come to Pakistan and create a force of Mujahideen, equip them with stinger missiles and everything else to go after the Soviets inside Afghanistan.
[00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:42.812]  And we were successful.
[00:05:42.872 --> 00:05:45.054]  And this really just is so disgusting.
[00:05:45.174 --> 00:05:51.658]  When Vince Foster left his White House office on that July day in 1993, he told his secretary that he would be back.
[00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:56.421]  But the Deputy White House Counsel and boyhood friend of Bill Clinton never returned.
[00:05:56.761 --> 00:06:00.023]  There has been this urgency to end this.
[00:06:00.504 --> 00:06:04.086]  And, you know, historically that makes no sense.
[00:06:04.286 --> 00:06:09.029]  We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California.
[00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:18.691]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:06:18.731 --> 00:06:20.492]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:06:20.892 --> 00:06:32.315]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[00:06:32.595 --> 00:06:37.302]  Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks.
[00:06:37.482 --> 00:06:40.767]  We have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton.
[00:06:41.027 --> 00:06:48.478]  You know, the emails we published show that Hillary Clinton is receiving constant updates about my personal situation.
[00:06:48.598 --> 00:06:54.000]  The latest story was the death of DNC staffer Seth Rich, who was murdered last month in an apparent robbery.
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:01.202]  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has hinted that Rich was his source, but has made no further comments about the case.
[00:07:01.542 --> 00:07:03.683]  That murder, we should say, remains unsolved.
[00:07:03.883 --> 00:07:14.106]  There's a 27-year-old that works for the DNC who was shot in the back, murdered just two weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.
[00:07:14.346 --> 00:07:18.689]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:25.914]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[00:07:36.072 --> 00:07:45.681]  Now we are introducing a new t-shirt, which I think folks need to get, telling the real truth about Bill Clinton, who is a serial rapist and an abuser of women.
[00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:49.584]  In another case, it's about groping and fondling and touching against a woman's will.
[00:07:49.744 --> 00:07:50.085]  And rape.
[00:07:50.285 --> 00:07:50.665]  And rape.
[00:07:50.745 --> 00:07:54.909]  Bill rapes them physically, and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[00:07:54.969 --> 00:07:55.610]  He's a rapist.
[00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.551]  Absolutely.
[00:07:56.571 --> 00:07:57.892]  He's a public figure, he goes straight to hell.
[00:07:58.032 --> 00:08:03.793]  Get your Bill Clinton rape shirt today at Infowarsstore.com or call 1-800-253-3139.
[00:08:03.813 --> 00:08:24.217]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:24.277 --> 00:08:27.378]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[00:08:28.168 --> 00:08:30.050]  And they're also very affordable.
[00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:58.914]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[00:08:59.314 --> 00:09:00.074]  It's a win-win.
[00:09:00.554 --> 00:09:01.335]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:09:06.912 --> 00:09:09.594]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:09:09.814 --> 00:09:12.876]  That communist Chinese style net censorship was coming to the web.
[00:09:13.216 --> 00:09:13.936]  Because it's already here.
[00:09:14.337 --> 00:09:14.977]  It's being announced.
[00:09:15.337 --> 00:09:18.819]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.161]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:09:21.261 --> 00:09:22.822]  A new battleship in the fight.
[00:09:23.022 --> 00:09:24.023]  InfoWars Live.
[00:09:24.203 --> 00:09:25.023]  Available right now.
[00:09:25.303 --> 00:09:26.644]  We're looking for a crew to manor.
[00:09:27.085 --> 00:09:29.486]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[00:09:30.066 --> 00:09:31.107]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[00:09:31.667 --> 00:09:34.649]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.730]  Take action!
[00:09:49.309 --> 00:10:02.517]  A stony silence turned to sheer horror early Wednesday for Hillary Clinton supporters and what was meant to be her presidential victory party as it became painfully clear that she would not close the gap with Donald Trump.
[00:10:03.798 --> 00:10:08.121]  One by one, states turned Republican red on the interactive map of the country.
[00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:14.365]  One by one, dejected Clinton fans left in tears without even seeing their beloved candidate.
[00:10:16.317 --> 00:10:32.222]  It's a nightmare, said Jeanette Barberash, a 50-something Clinton backer, leaving the cavernous Javits Center on the west side of Midtown Manhattan, which had been decked out with American flags for Clinton's expected win.
[00:10:34.563 --> 00:10:35.063]  Not great.
[00:10:35.103 --> 00:10:36.043]  We're totally distraught.
[00:10:36.083 --> 00:10:37.824]  We never thought this could happen.
[00:10:39.204 --> 00:10:44.046]  Brian Smith, a 40-year-old consultant from New York City, could simply not process what had happened.
[00:10:45.888 --> 00:10:49.851]  It had been too overwhelming to see things shift in a day, in an hour, in a minute, he lamented.
[00:10:51.472 --> 00:10:54.535]  Indeed, no one was expecting such a violent slap in the face.
[00:10:55.775 --> 00:11:05.363]  Some were saying it would be close, but no one imagined the night would turn into a political funeral for the 69-year-old former First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State.
[00:11:07.985 --> 00:11:08.965]  And there you have it, folks.
[00:11:09.025 --> 00:11:11.087]  We are now creating history.
[00:11:11.107 --> 00:11:13.109]  I'm Rob Due.
[00:11:14.309 --> 00:11:17.231]  I've been here all night and took a couple hours sleep.
[00:11:17.251 --> 00:11:25.337]  I'm going to be your host for the next couple hours of this 52-hour broadcast, which will end at 3 p.m.
[00:11:25.417 --> 00:11:25.737]  today.
[00:11:25.757 --> 00:11:34.022]  And we have to congratulate ourselves, pat ourselves on the back.
[00:11:38.265 --> 00:11:41.748]  New York Times is still not calling
[00:11:43.257 --> 00:11:43.938]  Four states.
[00:11:45.319 --> 00:11:45.880]  Minnesota.
[00:11:47.461 --> 00:11:47.862]  Michigan.
[00:11:49.403 --> 00:11:50.064]  New Hampshire.
[00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:53.467]  And Arizona, surprisingly.
[00:11:54.228 --> 00:11:56.130]  I think Arizona is very surprising, but look at that.
[00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.713]  Then you have this blue corridor right here.
[00:12:00.294 --> 00:12:06.521]  And if you believe these results from California, you believe Donald Trump did worse than Mitt Romney.
[00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:14.786]  But it was a crazy night indeed.
[00:12:15.186 --> 00:12:18.769]  Watching the vote tallies come in.
[00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:21.531]  Watching Florida sit at 99%.
[00:12:22.352 --> 00:12:25.174]  And Trump being ahead.
[00:12:25.194 --> 00:12:27.556]  And them not giving it to him.
[00:12:30.198 --> 00:12:33.101]  Watching Pennsylvania go late into the night and Wisconsin.
[00:12:34.682 --> 00:12:40.067]  In fact, at one point, Fox had given him Wisconsin, but not Pennsylvania.
[00:12:42.335 --> 00:12:44.916]  And the New York Times had given him Pennsylvania, but not Wisconsin.
[00:12:46.597 --> 00:12:49.238]  And that is when I finally said, alright, he's won.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:13:01.584]  Because until we saw him go over the magic number, I didn't think it would be possible.
[00:13:03.084 --> 00:13:07.246]  I really didn't think the system would let him win.
[00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:10.468]  Even right now,
[00:13:12.236 --> 00:13:17.820]  It shows Hillary Clinton with 59,232,000 votes and Donald Trump with 59,080,000 votes.
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.363]  I can't afford to believe those tallies.
[00:13:23.544 --> 00:13:25.065]  California looks very suspicious.
[00:13:27.086 --> 00:13:28.687]  It didn't even crack 3 million.
[00:13:32.229 --> 00:13:34.131]  And here's a result from Mitt Romney.
[00:13:34.171 --> 00:13:35.992]  Mitt Romney cracked 4 million.
[00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:46.978]  But he has won the Electoral College substantially.
[00:13:56.406 --> 00:13:57.727]  So here we are, the next day.
[00:13:57.747 --> 00:14:03.031]  Should be a day of celebration.
[00:14:06.334 --> 00:14:07.715]  Should be a day of coming together.
[00:14:15.925 --> 00:14:31.189]  Should be a day where we can offer our hand to those we may have ridiculed along this seems like over two year journey at this point.
[00:14:39.291 --> 00:14:39.851]  I tell you what.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:51.964]  When you look up at the Rust Belt in Pennsylvania and Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, even in Michigan, these people were sick of it.
[00:14:51.984 --> 00:15:05.431]  They were sick of what they had seen in their time on Earth of countries getting better deals than us, of jobs going to other countries.
[00:15:10.029 --> 00:15:12.631]  Of a government who didn't seem to care about its people.
[00:15:15.253 --> 00:15:17.294]  And hopefully that has come to an end.
[00:15:17.354 --> 00:15:27.582]  Hopefully we've come now and are going to become a country that can start working on these problems.
[00:15:28.402 --> 00:15:29.743]  Here's from Business Insider.
[00:15:29.803 --> 00:15:31.284]  Peter Thiel on Trump's win.
[00:15:31.344 --> 00:15:33.446]  He has an awesomely difficult task.
[00:15:35.239 --> 00:15:41.603]  Silicon Valley's most famous Donald Trump supporter has issued a statement on the President-elect's historic win.
[00:15:43.405 --> 00:15:47.828]  He praised Trump's win and acknowledged the uphill battle ahead of the President-elect.
[00:15:49.769 --> 00:15:51.510]  Congratulations to President Donald Trump.
[00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:58.995]  You did an awesomely difficult task, and since it's long past time for us to face up to our country's problems, we're going to need all hands on deck.
[00:15:59.355 --> 00:15:59.856]  In fact, that
[00:16:01.355 --> 00:16:12.045]  Is almost the same text I got from a friend of mine who lived in Pennsylvania, who earlier in the night said, we may be living in a country where the Constitution is archaic.
[00:16:13.586 --> 00:16:17.570]  And something our children and grandchildren look back as an anachronism.
[00:16:21.533 --> 00:16:22.414]  But that changed.
[00:16:28.354 --> 00:16:29.335]  All hands on deck.
[00:16:29.375 --> 00:16:34.540]  We're going to need everybody to work on this problem of fixing our country.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:35.961]  But we can do it.
[00:16:38.043 --> 00:16:38.603]  We can do it.
[00:16:38.803 --> 00:16:40.004]  It's not as hard as we think.
[00:16:40.685 --> 00:16:47.411]  And once we start scrubbing away at the grime, we're going to find it's easily removed.
[00:16:53.857 --> 00:16:57.839]  I'm gonna go to a video at some point called Globalist to Attack Trump with Economic Collapse.
[00:16:57.859 --> 00:17:02.502]  This is something Alex Jones shot with us right before he left at the end of the night.
[00:17:04.263 --> 00:17:05.623]  He was tired, like the rest of us.
[00:17:05.663 --> 00:17:06.484]  He'd been up for a while.
[00:17:07.084 --> 00:17:07.624]  Long time.
[00:17:11.587 --> 00:17:18.630]  And at the end of the night last night, there were some economic indicators that looked like, oh boy, Wall Street's not gonna be happy with this win.
[00:17:19.131 --> 00:17:21.212]  Chris Hayes was on the television.
[00:17:22.622 --> 00:17:29.606]  Talking about how they had stopped some overnight trading in the markets because it had hit a 5% threshold.
[00:17:29.626 --> 00:17:33.908]  And the markets weren't gonna like this.
[00:17:34.648 --> 00:17:35.448]  This Trump win.
[00:17:35.468 --> 00:17:41.151]  Here's an interesting story.
[00:17:41.452 --> 00:17:46.134]  Philippines President Duarte says his country can enhance relations with the U.S.
[00:17:46.194 --> 00:17:50.076]  and congratulate Trump a month after telling Obama to go to hell.
[00:18:00.236 --> 00:18:14.349]  President, Philippines President, President Rodrigo Duarte has congratulated Donald Trump on his shock election win, saying the reality TV star can enhance relations with the Asian country.
[00:18:18.412 --> 00:18:26.720]  Having repeatedly threatened to end his nation's alliance with Washington, he said to be looking forward to working with the incoming administration.
[00:18:29.605 --> 00:18:33.307]  And you know he's going to catch hell from the left constantly.
[00:18:34.868 --> 00:18:36.489]  And it's going to be penny ante stuff.
[00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:38.470]  It's not going to be issues of substance.
[00:18:40.391 --> 00:18:42.372]  They're not interested in issues of substance.
[00:18:42.652 --> 00:18:46.935]  They're going to be interested in standing on the sideline and crowing.
[00:18:57.523 --> 00:18:58.544]  Remember Lady Gaga?
[00:18:58.584 --> 00:19:06.495]  She wore the Nazi-esque uniform for Hillary's last rally in Burnham Independence Hall.
[00:19:11.874 --> 00:19:20.541]  Lady Gaga stages protest outside Trump Tower while Katy Perry vows not to let hate lead us as Hillary's Hollywood stars struggle to cope.
[00:19:20.562 --> 00:19:25.065]  In fact, last night the immigration website for Canada broke down.
[00:19:25.866 --> 00:19:27.347]  So maybe a lot of people are going to leave.
[00:19:27.427 --> 00:19:31.491]  Maybe they're not ready to work, to do the work to put this country back together.
[00:19:34.734 --> 00:19:36.415]  And hey, we're doing good.
[00:19:37.316 --> 00:19:39.518]  But we have a lot, we have a long way to go.
[00:19:41.752 --> 00:19:42.652]  We have a long way to go.
[00:19:42.672 --> 00:19:49.136]  And there's Lady Gaga with a dump truck.
[00:19:55.359 --> 00:19:59.481]  With her Love Trumps Hate poster.
[00:20:03.943 --> 00:20:06.344]  And I think at this point we have to show them what love is.
[00:20:09.582 --> 00:20:15.806]  This is not the time to go after the Bernie Sanders or the Hillary Clinton supporters.
[00:20:15.826 --> 00:20:21.270]  It's time to take our victory, absorb it, and look at what needs to be done.
[00:20:22.071 --> 00:20:22.751]  And start there.
[00:20:22.771 --> 00:20:24.713]  And make it happen.
[00:20:26.234 --> 00:20:27.555]  Got some callers on the line.
[00:20:27.855 --> 00:20:29.136]  Are we ready to go to calls?
[00:20:30.137 --> 00:20:30.477]  Okay.
[00:20:32.378 --> 00:20:33.699]  Let's go to Bruce in Maryland.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.561]  Hey Bruce, thanks for holding.
[00:20:38.283 --> 00:20:38.583]  Go ahead.
[00:20:40.186 --> 00:20:44.448]  I've got a couple of points that have been sitting on hold for a while, so they kept growing.
[00:20:44.728 --> 00:20:45.728]  Sure.
[00:20:46.129 --> 00:20:47.309]  First, I'd like to say this.
[00:20:47.569 --> 00:20:52.131]  I bought my first car in 1971, my first new car.
[00:20:53.251 --> 00:20:55.652]  It cost me $60 a month to buy it.
[00:20:55.953 --> 00:21:06.597]  If you had car insurance, if you had to pay more than one car payment for full car insurance, that was considered expensive.
[00:21:07.449 --> 00:21:14.711]  In 1975, the state said that insurance became mandatory and state regulated.
[00:21:15.772 --> 00:21:19.493]  My insurance went up from $80 a year to about $300.
[00:21:19.973 --> 00:21:26.595]  Now the average for full coverage insurance is of, what, $2,400, $2,500.
[00:21:27.775 --> 00:21:32.477]  When Trump says, get rid of the regulation and get the government out of insurance,
[00:21:33.439 --> 00:21:37.243]  It's amazing what can happen and people are panicking over nothing.
[00:21:37.603 --> 00:21:42.688]  We're always learning the same lessons over and over and over.
[00:21:42.708 --> 00:21:50.655]  The other one is we dodged a bullet getting rid of the puppet of Hillary Clinton.
[00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:54.539]  The problem is we still have the puppet master out there.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.042]  I consider them the bankers.
[00:21:59.257 --> 00:22:10.965]  And the Rothschilds from the Bank of England to their next attempt, the Bank of America, now the Federal Reserve, they are relentless.
[00:22:10.985 --> 00:22:19.050]  And if we are not vigilant, if we clean up this mess, it'll happen again and again and again.
[00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:23.672]  We've allowed this republic to go to hell.
[00:22:23.933 --> 00:22:25.534]  There's no other... I'm sorry.
[00:22:26.434 --> 00:22:26.654]  Yeah.
[00:22:26.714 --> 00:22:27.675]  We've allowed it to...
[00:22:28.246 --> 00:22:36.691]  By our own, just not taking care of what is the best country on the planet that the planet has ever known.
[00:22:38.072 --> 00:22:49.258]  The last thing, the last couple of things to chew on, um, the, uh, Stephen Molyneux, I cannot pronounce his name.
[00:22:52.355 --> 00:22:53.496]  Thank you, thank you.
[00:22:54.017 --> 00:23:03.146]  He has, I hate to do a plug for somebody else, but he has one thing called How to Argue with a Social Justice Warrior or a Liberal.
[00:23:03.847 --> 00:23:13.176]  It is a phenomenal, phenomenal video and it hopefully could open up some people how to deal with the brainwashed liberals.
[00:23:14.135 --> 00:23:22.457]  Because it definitely takes a non-violent and it diffuses the confrontation with trying to open up their minds.
[00:23:24.937 --> 00:23:29.358]  And finally, this one came from your predecessor.
[00:23:29.398 --> 00:23:38.060]  He was asking, what do you think that Hillary was feeling and why she backed out of giving her concession speech?
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:43.321]  I believe it was abject terror and betrayal.
[00:23:43.846 --> 00:23:49.610]  My own personal conspiracy theory is that actually Trump did a deal.
[00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:51.251]  Not a deal in a bad way.
[00:23:51.971 --> 00:23:52.832]  A deal of this.
[00:23:53.792 --> 00:23:57.535]  I personally think that we're on the verge of violent revolution.
[00:23:57.815 --> 00:24:00.036]  I truly think we're violent.
[00:24:02.277 --> 00:24:09.422]  And quite frankly, Trump said, play with the numbers, do whatever you have to do, but leave.
[00:24:10.202 --> 00:24:11.143]  I'll let you go.
[00:24:11.403 --> 00:24:12.724]  Just get out of the country.
[00:24:13.713 --> 00:24:15.854]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[00:24:15.874 --> 00:24:18.655]  And I can see Trump doing that, saying, you know what?
[00:24:18.735 --> 00:24:19.775]  I've got this.
[00:24:45.543 --> 00:24:46.083]  Take off.
[00:24:47.904 --> 00:24:48.965]  But she can't run forever.
[00:24:48.985 --> 00:24:51.706]  It's like Janet Reno couldn't run forever.
[00:24:52.086 --> 00:24:59.530]  There was a little meme going around with a picture of Janet Reno and it said, Donald Trump will never be president in my lifetime.
[00:25:03.152 --> 00:25:05.333]  And it was the day after her lifetime.
[00:25:06.774 --> 00:25:07.394]  Too soon.
[00:25:07.414 --> 00:25:08.295]  Yeah.
[00:25:10.176 --> 00:25:10.516]  Too soon.
[00:25:11.792 --> 00:25:15.855]  Here's some tweets from, this is Chris Evans, the guy who plays Captain America.
[00:25:15.875 --> 00:25:19.378]  This is an embarrassing night for America.
[00:25:19.998 --> 00:25:22.260]  We've let a hate monger lead our great nation.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.341]  We let a bully set our course.
[00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:25.222]  I'm devastated.
[00:25:26.043 --> 00:25:31.527]  Now I would use those characteristics to describe Hillary Clinton.
[00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:40.053]  But Chris Evans wouldn't do that because he's ignorant and he has no idea what Hillary Clinton's done.
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.861]  Here's Kunal Nayyar.
[00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:44.902]  I don't even know who this is.
[00:25:46.043 --> 00:25:51.909]  Never in the 15 years of living in this country have I ever felt so afraid to look like I do.
[00:25:51.929 --> 00:25:54.472]  No one's coming after you, buddy.
[00:25:58.015 --> 00:26:01.238]  But, lay on the ground, flop around like a little victim.
[00:26:01.759 --> 00:26:02.619]  Ariana Grande.
[00:26:02.639 --> 00:26:05.082]  Well, this is utterly terrifying.
[00:26:16.059 --> 00:26:23.646]  Somebody tweeted a picture of Martin Luther King saying, never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was legal.
[00:26:23.666 --> 00:26:25.088]  1963 letter from a Birmingham jail.
[00:26:28.771 --> 00:26:29.712]  Literally Hitler.
[00:26:29.732 --> 00:26:30.753]  Literally.
[00:26:37.657 --> 00:26:40.319]  Nigella Lawson, I've never heard of these people.
[00:26:40.359 --> 00:26:43.101]  This is more than just populism, it's racism.
[00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:45.602]  Confederate flags will be flying.
[00:26:47.684 --> 00:26:48.764]  Hey Rob, this is Nico.
[00:26:49.445 --> 00:27:04.295]  On the way in this morning I was listening to NPR and they had several segments about how racist America is and that white America just could not stand to have a black man presiding over them and that this is an extreme reaction to that.
[00:27:04.315 --> 00:27:05.275]  His term was up!
[00:27:07.827 --> 00:27:22.279]  Yeah, his camera's up, and so then we have to give it to the lady, and then we have to give it to an Asian, and then we have, you know, it's just like, it can't be, we can't base the person on their actions, no, because that's what we're told to do.
[00:27:22.879 --> 00:27:25.121]  Don't judge a book by its cover, base the person on their actions.
[00:27:25.221 --> 00:27:27.743]  Oh no, we can't base Hillary Clinton on her actions.
[00:27:29.445 --> 00:27:30.546]  No, we can't do that.
[00:27:31.667 --> 00:27:33.128]  We have to give it to her because she's a girl.
[00:27:38.063 --> 00:27:43.807]  Well, for those liberals who don't like it, go ahead and leave.
[00:27:46.809 --> 00:27:48.370]  Trevor Noah.
[00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:52.492]  They can't because Canada's immigration site has been shut down.
[00:27:54.154 --> 00:27:58.096]  The traffic on the immigration site shut it down.
[00:27:59.637 --> 00:28:00.197]  They killed it.
[00:28:00.738 --> 00:28:01.658]  They're trying to get out.
[00:28:02.119 --> 00:28:03.780]  Zach Braff, though, we Brexited.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.341]  He doesn't seem to.
[00:28:05.721 --> 00:28:06.702]  Oh, but he's a white guy.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.500]  Seth MacFarlane, he's a white guy.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.121]  Some didn't like Bush, some didn't like Obama, but this is different.
[00:28:12.181 --> 00:28:12.921]  Forget dislike.
[00:28:13.061 --> 00:28:15.061]  Many are genuinely fearful now.
[00:28:18.242 --> 00:28:20.222]  I was fearful of a Hillary Clinton presidency.
[00:28:25.684 --> 00:28:27.524]  Five steps forward, ten steps back.
[00:28:27.564 --> 00:28:28.184]  Trevor Noah.
[00:28:29.104 --> 00:28:31.085]  I wouldn't even consider this guy a comedian.
[00:28:31.105 --> 00:28:32.485]  He's not that funny.
[00:28:32.505 --> 00:28:37.106]  He's one of those daily show hosts.
[00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.712]  Ellen DeGeneres is honored to be Hillary Clinton's friend.
[00:28:44.792 --> 00:28:45.393]  We just lose.
[00:28:46.133 --> 00:28:50.937]  Let's go to another caller.
[00:28:50.997 --> 00:28:52.619]  Let's go to Michael in Georgia.
[00:28:52.639 --> 00:28:58.544]  It took a while for Georgia to be called for Trump.
[00:28:58.804 --> 00:29:00.085]  What was going on there, Michael?
[00:29:07.165 --> 00:29:08.185]  You still there, Michael?
[00:29:09.085 --> 00:29:09.786]  You fall asleep?
[00:29:10.206 --> 00:29:10.486]  Sorry.
[00:29:10.506 --> 00:29:12.686]  I didn't go to you quick enough.
[00:29:17.328 --> 00:29:17.948]  Alright, Michael.
[00:29:19.368 --> 00:29:23.009]  Well, we sat there and watched Georgia sit pink for a long time.
[00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:28.270]  Let's go to Darren in Tennessee, one of the first states to go for Trump.
[00:29:29.691 --> 00:29:31.151]  What are your concerns on Trump, Darren?
[00:29:32.531 --> 00:29:33.352]  Hey, are you there, Rob?
[00:29:33.372 --> 00:29:34.052]  Can you hear me okay?
[00:29:34.112 --> 00:29:34.572]  I can hear you.
[00:29:35.612 --> 00:29:38.495]  Hey, thanks for your, uh, thanks for your guys, all your guys great work.
[00:29:38.535 --> 00:29:41.198]  Listen, I gotta try to run through a bunch of points real quick.
[00:29:41.858 --> 00:29:44.281]  Um, first thing I want to do is I just want to thank God.
[00:29:44.561 --> 00:29:47.104]  I mean, I'm a, I'm an older gentleman, retired firefighter.
[00:29:47.644 --> 00:29:52.749]  I remember when America was great and, um, I had been praying for days for this.
[00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.152]  And I mean, maybe one guy
[00:29:55.899 --> 00:29:57.460]  I'm glad that he got to see this.
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.782]  I'm glad that he got to see this happen.
[00:29:59.802 --> 00:30:01.964]  I'm glad he was so spot on in all his
[00:30:25.077 --> 00:30:27.117]  All his points that he made.
[00:30:27.658 --> 00:30:31.998]  I just want to tell Larry Nichols, I really appreciate his service to the country.
[00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:34.419]  I'm going to get choked up if I say any more.
[00:30:35.219 --> 00:30:36.299]  Lastly, two things.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.520]  I'm very concerned about Donald Trump's safety.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.501]  There's a long way between now and January.
[00:30:43.521 --> 00:30:45.301]  We all need to pray for him for his safety.
[00:30:46.081 --> 00:30:47.762]  Somebody doesn't try to take him out or something.
[00:30:48.162 --> 00:30:50.362]  That's in the back of everybody's mind, I know.
[00:30:50.382 --> 00:30:53.163]  That was a tragedy.
[00:30:54.238 --> 00:30:58.861]  I think if he mentioned those 28 pages, there's so much work to be done, so much that has to be done.
[00:30:58.901 --> 00:31:02.123]  Those 28 pages are kind of minuscule compared to everything.
[00:31:02.163 --> 00:31:08.807]  But Alex always says, and you all always say, you know, come out with stuff to protect yourself.
[00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:10.688]  You know, Saudi Arabia could be a threat.
[00:31:11.329 --> 00:31:15.791]  And I think the sooner those 28 pages come out, the better for him and his safety.
[00:31:16.232 --> 00:31:19.634]  And lastly, I'm in Tennessee now, but I'm a Floridian.
[00:31:19.974 --> 00:31:21.535]  I'm proud of my state down there.
[00:31:22.065 --> 00:31:24.607]  Like you said, I don't know why it took them so long to call it.
[00:31:24.647 --> 00:31:29.491]  They were actually trying to call it for Gore back in the Bush campaign, when Bush was clearly ahead.
[00:31:30.012 --> 00:31:31.793]  So, um, that doesn't surprise me here.
[00:31:31.813 --> 00:31:34.376]  But my daughter at Virginia is in Palm Beach County, Florida.
[00:31:34.916 --> 00:31:38.339]  One of the, uh, the big three down there that always go Democrat.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.161]  Um, she called me in tears yesterday.
[00:31:41.562 --> 00:31:42.983]  Um, after your, your, um,
[00:31:43.772 --> 00:31:51.575]  Your show had announced that a poll worker was attacked in Palm Beach County by a raving maniac who threw her down, grabbed her neck and threw her down.
[00:31:51.595 --> 00:31:54.477]  My daughter was going down to Lake Worth to vote.
[00:31:55.017 --> 00:31:56.197]  She's in North Palm Beach now.
[00:31:57.238 --> 00:32:03.821]  And when she got to go in to vote, she saw a bus pull up and there were people getting off the bus.
[00:32:04.421 --> 00:32:09.223]  And they were yelling at a couple of people holding signs, Mother Effer, this and that, you know, all kinds of obscenities.
[00:32:09.978 --> 00:32:13.539]  And she went in the boat and she came out and there were police trying to break up a scuffle.
[00:32:14.059 --> 00:32:16.700]  There were fisted cuffs and all kind of stuff.
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:22.501]  And yet when she lifted up in the news story, the official news story today, it was totally different.
[00:32:22.861 --> 00:32:31.044]  She said it was talking about an old guy that supposedly pulled a gun on a Clinton supporter and she said that wasn't anything like it.
[00:32:31.344 --> 00:32:32.224]  She said that I was there.
[00:32:32.264 --> 00:32:35.325]  Guys were getting off a bus, you know, like in a hurry.
[00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:39.892]  And they started, as soon as they got off, they were shouting obscenities and everything.
[00:32:39.912 --> 00:32:44.255]  So, just one more thing that the mainstream news is skewed, you know?
[00:32:44.935 --> 00:32:48.857]  Well, last night we were watching images of riots going on in California.
[00:32:48.877 --> 00:32:51.399]  You know, people aren't happy.
[00:32:51.419 --> 00:32:55.981]  There's probably going to be riots at the inauguration in January.
[00:32:58.143 --> 00:32:58.643]  And who knows?
[00:32:58.703 --> 00:33:00.224]  What if we don't make it to inauguration?
[00:33:00.244 --> 00:33:03.406]  What if things drastically change in this country for the worse?
[00:33:06.869 --> 00:33:11.733]  Doing your job and putting the truth out there, and I'm sure more and more people are going to be looking.
[00:33:11.773 --> 00:33:14.475]  I mean, you've vindicated yourselves over the mainstream media.
[00:33:15.196 --> 00:33:18.759]  Like Owen said earlier, you know, everybody else was wrong.
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.942]  And what you guys were saying has been the fact all along.
[00:33:22.022 --> 00:33:26.245]  So maybe, maybe people will even look more than twice at you now.
[00:33:26.926 --> 00:33:28.147]  Thank you guys for the great job.
[00:33:28.227 --> 00:33:28.988]  Thank Larry Nichols.
[00:33:29.008 --> 00:33:29.608]  Thank all of you.
[00:33:30.729 --> 00:33:34.913]  Well, thank you, Darren, for getting out there and spreading the word and helping support us.
[00:33:36.437 --> 00:33:41.679]  And if you're listening to this right now, watching, this is part of our 52-hour broadcast.
[00:33:43.099 --> 00:33:47.121]  We've got some pretty good sales going on.
[00:33:47.641 --> 00:33:54.543]  Maybe somebody sent you the link, you've just tuned in.
[00:33:55.203 --> 00:33:56.064]  Who is this InfoWars?
[00:33:56.084 --> 00:34:01.645]  Who is this elder gentleman with a suit and tie on at 8.35 in the morning?
[00:34:05.441 --> 00:34:07.963]  Reading tweets from pissed off celebrities.
[00:34:11.225 --> 00:34:25.756]  Well, InfoWars.com is a organization that started off one man and his passion to tell the truth and has grown into a very large organization.
[00:34:29.438 --> 00:34:31.380]  And we're TV and radio based.
[00:34:33.461 --> 00:34:34.162]  Internet based.
[00:34:35.421 --> 00:34:36.581]  Got a big presence out there.
[00:34:36.601 --> 00:34:44.825]  And we try to give people the news unfiltered from a mainstream media bias.
[00:34:47.066 --> 00:34:55.489]  And that bias is usually predicated by what the sponsors want the people to say or whatever war needs to be promoted.
[00:34:55.509 --> 00:34:59.431]  We're a little different.
[00:35:01.874 --> 00:35:04.135]  And we want to see everybody prosper in this country.
[00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:11.359]  Not just blacks, not just whites, not just Asians, not just Latinos, everybody.
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.200]  And we can all prosper.
[00:35:16.182 --> 00:35:17.163]  We can all prosper.
[00:35:18.744 --> 00:35:20.325]  We can all reach our potential.
[00:35:22.066 --> 00:35:24.367]  We can all hand our children a better life.
[00:35:30.652 --> 00:35:31.793]  And I think we can do it now.
[00:35:34.095 --> 00:35:36.837]  Instead of running around and playing defense and running for cover.
[00:35:38.218 --> 00:35:39.479]  With the Clinton administration.
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:45.683]  I hope and pray a Trump administration does the things they say they're going to do.
[00:35:45.744 --> 00:35:47.445]  I think when you see the taxes cut.
[00:35:48.946 --> 00:35:49.426]  You see your.
[00:35:50.247 --> 00:35:54.070]  Find yourself having a lot more money to spend on the things you want to spend it on.
[00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:59.274]  Maybe takes because after government waste.
[00:36:02.987 --> 00:36:08.489]  Because can you argue that our government's inefficient and that we waste a lot of money?
[00:36:16.612 --> 00:36:17.432]  I can't argue with that.
[00:36:19.313 --> 00:36:23.894]  So once again, we're having a 52-hour live election broadcast Supercell fundraiser.
[00:36:25.535 --> 00:36:27.195]  And this is going to go to about 3 p.m.
[00:36:27.235 --> 00:36:27.535]  today.
[00:36:27.555 --> 00:36:31.517]  30% off Supermail Vitality.
[00:36:33.027 --> 00:36:34.168]  30% off DNA Force.
[00:36:34.188 --> 00:36:37.290]  30 to 40% off InfoWars Select Storable Foods.
[00:36:39.012 --> 00:36:40.513]  30% off Survival Shield X2.
[00:36:42.374 --> 00:36:43.475]  What is Survival Shield X2?
[00:36:43.495 --> 00:36:44.636]  That's nascent iodine.
[00:36:50.601 --> 00:36:52.883]  And it's a lot different than the iodine you get in salt.
[00:36:54.424 --> 00:36:56.125]  They used to put in salt in bread.
[00:36:56.145 --> 00:36:58.387]  They used to do that.
[00:37:01.186 --> 00:37:04.808]  It's been mandated that you had to get a certain amount of iodine in your food supply.
[00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:10.291]  And now they don't do that.
[00:37:10.611 --> 00:37:12.012]  So now we have to supplement with it.
[00:37:15.254 --> 00:37:19.576]  Well, you get another halogen in there.
[00:37:19.616 --> 00:37:21.137]  You get fluoride a lot in your water.
[00:37:24.979 --> 00:37:26.640]  This is how screwed up our system is.
[00:37:29.653 --> 00:37:31.074]  They put fluoride in our water.
[00:37:32.054 --> 00:37:35.235]  They say it's for your teeth, but you drink it.
[00:37:39.637 --> 00:37:41.478]  I don't know, a lot of people have teeth in their stomach.
[00:37:44.099 --> 00:37:54.863]  And to help get that fluoride out, which is also one of the main ingredients in rat poison, and Prozac,
[00:37:56.826 --> 00:37:58.767]  We have the ProPure King water filters.
[00:37:58.807 --> 00:38:07.233]  They take out the fluoride that water municipalities across the country pay to put in.
[00:38:08.894 --> 00:38:10.075]  Where do they get their fluoride?
[00:38:11.576 --> 00:38:16.760]  Well, they get it from phosphate fertilizer companies.
[00:38:20.302 --> 00:38:22.684]  Back in the olden days, in the 50s, 60s,
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:31.463]  And blow fluorides out of their smokestacks.
[00:38:32.703 --> 00:38:35.705]  And then go over to the next field and kill a farmer's cows.
[00:38:36.366 --> 00:38:37.366]  Or destroy orchards.
[00:38:40.588 --> 00:38:53.796]  So the government made these companies put water scrubbers, basically just sprayers that would spray the smoke down as it comes up and it would hit the fluoride-infused smoke and react with the fluoride and it would drop down.
[00:38:57.185 --> 00:39:00.728]  And it makes this interesting compound called hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:10.875]  And so these companies were forced with, what do we do with this stuff that's a toxic waste dump that we're just literally creating?
[00:39:10.895 --> 00:39:13.917]  And their solution was, you know what?
[00:39:14.298 --> 00:39:17.400]  We're going to tell people this is for their teeth and we're going to sell it back to them.
[00:39:21.067 --> 00:39:34.596]  Because in the 1940s, some guy looked at a population that had naturally fluoridated water from natural fluoride deposits, said, hey, these people have better teeth than other people I've looked at.
[00:39:34.616 --> 00:39:37.739]  So it was automatically fluoride in the water supply.
[00:39:40.821 --> 00:39:42.282]  But you're not getting fluoride.
[00:39:42.422 --> 00:39:44.743]  They don't even put fluoride in your water supplies.
[00:39:45.324 --> 00:39:46.905]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:39:48.533 --> 00:39:50.813]  Spell that, look it up, see what's in it.
[00:39:50.833 --> 00:39:53.554]  Look at the MSDS of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:39:55.454 --> 00:39:57.735]  And ask yourself, why do they put this in our water?
[00:40:00.416 --> 00:40:01.456]  And tell us it's good for us.
[00:40:01.476 --> 00:40:05.016]  A lot of things our government does that they say is good for us.
[00:40:07.817 --> 00:40:09.397]  They make us get health insurance now.
[00:40:13.178 --> 00:40:16.639]  Don't forget we have free domestic shipping store-wide.
[00:40:17.745 --> 00:40:18.925]  That's on the Pro Pure Kings.
[00:40:20.146 --> 00:40:22.107]  And every other item in our store.
[00:40:22.327 --> 00:40:23.987]  Free shipping storewide.
[00:40:26.869 --> 00:40:33.151]  And go to Infowarslife.com and Infowarsstore.com and check out the deals we have there, because we have some great deals.
[00:40:36.172 --> 00:40:40.214]  Let's go to James in Washington, wants to talk about the poll numbers being rigged.
[00:40:40.234 --> 00:40:42.014]  Go ahead, James.
[00:40:42.074 --> 00:40:42.335]  Hey.
[00:40:42.615 --> 00:40:42.975]  Hey, buddy.
[00:40:43.035 --> 00:40:43.435]  How you doing, man?
[00:40:45.177 --> 00:41:11.793]  Yeah, I'm in Washington State, and I don't know, I just, um, stomach awful, I'm tired, sorry, but, uh, the polls, I was watching them, the live polls on the, uh, America, whatever, you Google search presidential polls and the main website pops up and you watch every 30 seconds the website update, you know?
[00:41:12.594 --> 00:41:14.355]  I was watching Trump ahead
[00:41:15.689 --> 00:41:26.559]  By 2030, maybe 40,000 people popular vote, and within a minute or two, I've never seen it like this.
[00:41:26.859 --> 00:41:31.263]  The polls just switched, and she was up over 100,000 on him, and I lived in.
[00:41:33.817 --> 00:41:43.424]  I'm very familiar with the corruption going on with Bill Gates, Melinda Gates, passing I-594, violating our gun rights up here in Washington State.
[00:41:43.964 --> 00:41:47.927]  There's just a lot of corruption up here in Sussex Poole, liberal Seattle.
[00:41:50.409 --> 00:41:56.173]  You know, I find it hard to believe that Trump got less votes than Mitt Romney in California.
[00:41:58.877 --> 00:42:01.980]  She got 5.4 million, Hillary Clinton.
[00:42:02.641 --> 00:42:04.322]  Donald Trump got 2.9 million.
[00:42:04.342 --> 00:42:05.163]  That's what they're saying.
[00:42:05.183 --> 00:42:11.168]  And you look here at results from Mitt Romney and Barack Obama.
[00:42:11.188 --> 00:42:15.172]  Barack Obama got 6.4 million and Mitt Romney 4.2 million.
[00:42:16.773 --> 00:42:19.376]  So they're saying a lot less people went out and voted in California.
[00:42:21.522 --> 00:42:31.610]  And a lot of things these liberal states like Washington, people don't really realize about us over here in Washington, is this is still very much gun country.
[00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:46.642]  I'm in the union too, by the way, and the majority of guys I work with are all gun owners, and yet my union's pushing Hillary, and we're like, we love the union because we work our butts off and we get paid good money, but
[00:42:47.668 --> 00:42:51.550]  We see the socialist, you know, the bad sides of the union.
[00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:55.853]  We're in a tough situation where unions do support the people.
[00:42:55.873 --> 00:43:09.001]  We work very hard, we earn the money we make, and we make good money, but at the same time, they're pushing socialism and this... But yet, we're all looking at each other like, we're all gun owners here, man.
[00:43:09.041 --> 00:43:11.362]  We don't want nothing to do with these clowns.
[00:43:12.102 --> 00:43:16.325]  And so they try to make Washington State look like, you know, throughout the media, like
[00:43:17.074 --> 00:43:19.396]  And even around town, there's a lot of liberals around.
[00:43:19.416 --> 00:43:24.420]  Everybody's trying to make Washington just feel like a bad place.
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:25.821]  And it is, don't get me wrong.
[00:43:26.041 --> 00:43:31.505]  It's a cesspool of mentally ill, a lot of pharmaceutical mentally ill people.
[00:43:31.905 --> 00:43:42.013]  I had an old lady this morning call me an a-hole because I just blurted out, Trump, Trump!
[00:43:44.641 --> 00:43:48.866]  Old lady, I'm talking 80 years old, getting coffee, called me an a-hole.
[00:43:49.326 --> 00:43:51.509]  Tolerant liberal.
[00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.791]  Remains, man.
[00:43:53.831 --> 00:44:03.041]  There's a lot of country folk in Washington State, and I think that poll from last night just was a red flag to me.
[00:44:03.081 --> 00:44:04.502]  Like, how did she just go from 100,000 people above
[00:44:07.458 --> 00:44:13.361]  Well, they're going to use this to talk about for the next week how she got more votes than Donald Trump, yet he won.
[00:44:13.781 --> 00:44:15.102]  And he's got an overwhelming
[00:44:35.043 --> 00:44:37.505]  Majority in the Electoral College, if you look at the map right now.
[00:44:38.085 --> 00:44:42.529]  They're not even calling Arizona, Minnesota, Michigan, or New Hampshire.
[00:44:45.611 --> 00:44:46.952]  They're all too close to call.
[00:44:46.973 --> 00:44:52.177]  I guess they're gonna do recounts.
[00:44:53.318 --> 00:44:55.279]  They only have 99% reporting in Michigan.
[00:44:55.299 --> 00:44:58.161]  99% in Arizona.
[00:44:58.181 --> 00:45:00.223]  100% in Minnesota.
[00:45:00.483 --> 00:45:01.264]  They're not calling it.
[00:45:04.878 --> 00:45:07.719]  New Hampshire, 99% reporting.
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:26.464]  So, it's going to be interesting because we still have the citizens who voted for Hillary Clinton, and I don't believe the number posted on the New York Times website is accurate.
[00:45:27.564 --> 00:45:28.585]  I believe it's a lot less.
[00:45:31.005 --> 00:45:33.286]  And I think it's amazing that Trump was able to overcome
[00:45:36.058 --> 00:45:37.879]  The reports that we've heard of voter fraud.
[00:45:37.899 --> 00:45:42.600]  You know, if you hear one report, there's probably two or two or three others going on that you're not hearing about.
[00:45:44.761 --> 00:45:49.403]  And that he was able to overcome all that and still come out with a victory.
[00:45:49.463 --> 00:45:53.204]  But I mean, our our just look at the map from states.
[00:45:53.404 --> 00:45:54.645]  You can see the West Coast.
[00:45:56.885 --> 00:45:57.746]  See the East Coast.
[00:45:59.566 --> 00:46:00.847]  See the South.
[00:46:01.987 --> 00:46:02.687]  The Rust Belt.
[00:46:03.488 --> 00:46:04.188]  The Midwest.
[00:46:06.218 --> 00:46:07.459]  And the Canadian Rockies.
[00:46:09.241 --> 00:46:09.901]  Solid Trump.
[00:46:16.327 --> 00:46:16.587]  So.
[00:46:19.449 --> 00:46:20.170]  It's a good win.
[00:46:21.491 --> 00:46:23.593]  But will we see Hillary go to prison?
[00:46:26.035 --> 00:46:27.956]  James in Washington, thanks for calling.
[00:46:28.016 --> 00:46:30.779]  Let's go to Grace in New York who actually asked that question.
[00:46:30.819 --> 00:46:33.001]  Will Hillary actually go to prison now?
[00:46:33.301 --> 00:46:34.142]  It's a good question.
[00:46:36.058 --> 00:46:36.558]  Go ahead, Grace.
[00:46:36.598 --> 00:46:36.839]  Hello.
[00:46:37.179 --> 00:46:37.679]  Yeah, hi.
[00:46:37.719 --> 00:46:38.600]  Hi, how are you?
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:39.681]  I'm fine.
[00:46:40.881 --> 00:46:47.706]  So, I'm watching Donald Trump win and I'm all excited and not seeing Hillary.
[00:46:47.726 --> 00:46:56.292]  You know, he did say to her, if I was in charge of the law, you would go to jail.
[00:46:56.812 --> 00:47:02.797]  Is he going to use his executive powers or his
[00:47:05.741 --> 00:47:10.124]  His position to put her in prison.
[00:47:11.945 --> 00:47:15.928]  Well, luckily in this country we have checks and balances.
[00:47:17.609 --> 00:47:32.441]  And even though we have things like the NDAA that allows the president to call people unlawful combatants and put them away and hold them without even going to trial.
[00:47:33.564 --> 00:47:34.564]  I don't think he should do that.
[00:47:35.425 --> 00:47:47.349]  I think he should appoint a committee and investigate and put the evidence out there and convict her in the court of public opinion before he arrests her.
[00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:54.511]  And I think he needs to make sure it's bonafide, up one side and down the other.
[00:47:55.792 --> 00:47:56.492]  We know Hillary.
[00:47:56.512 --> 00:48:01.574]  We've covered her for many, many years.
[00:48:05.535 --> 00:48:11.737]  And it takes a special kind of person who wants to go into another country that's not as advanced as ours.
[00:48:13.078 --> 00:48:14.058]  Maybe looking for money.
[00:48:15.859 --> 00:48:16.659]  And squeeze them.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.201]  And squeeze them to the point where they collapse.
[00:48:21.621 --> 00:48:27.223]  So, Grace, how long have you been watching the 52-hour broadcast?
[00:48:31.059 --> 00:48:34.080]  I work overnight, so I've been watching it every night.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.020]  Oh, good.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.760]  Alright.
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.440]  How are you listening to us or watching us?
[00:48:39.121 --> 00:48:40.541]  On my app and my phone.
[00:48:40.561 --> 00:48:41.661]  Oh, good.
[00:48:43.401 --> 00:48:46.422]  Speaking of that, if you go to InfoWars, let me do a quick plug.
[00:48:46.522 --> 00:48:48.082]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:48:48.102 --> 00:48:54.823]  You can download our free app and we also have a beefed up subscription version called InfoWars Prime.
[00:48:56.384 --> 00:48:57.604]  That's only going to get better.
[00:49:00.322 --> 00:49:01.923]  I mean, we just released it last night.
[00:49:01.943 --> 00:49:13.553]  You're gonna be able to get exclusive videos from Alex Jones that you can't see anywhere else, behind the scenes, up close and personal, videos with info as reporters, on location, live coverage of breaking news and events.
[00:49:13.573 --> 00:49:25.522]  We're gonna have this set up where that's gonna be our main tool, where we put out breaking information and then it posts to our Facebook page and our YouTube page and our website.
[00:49:27.144 --> 00:49:29.706]  And it's also gonna have some amazing deals on it.
[00:49:31.303 --> 00:49:34.104]  I looked at it the other day, yesterday.
[00:49:34.124 --> 00:49:35.584]  They're putting it on my phone.
[00:49:36.464 --> 00:49:41.405]  And some of the deals that they had going for the next 21 hours were amazing.
[00:49:42.505 --> 00:49:44.566]  On Survival Shield and a few other products.
[00:49:45.086 --> 00:49:48.266]  I think the Survival Shield was like 60% off.
[00:49:49.627 --> 00:49:50.227]  Just crazy.
[00:49:51.927 --> 00:49:53.888]  But it's subscription-based.
[00:49:55.028 --> 00:50:00.689]  But the money you spend there goes directly to us and we're able to keep our operation going.
[00:50:02.045 --> 00:50:04.867]  And I know I seem a little laid back today.
[00:50:05.167 --> 00:50:05.928]  I'm pretty tired.
[00:50:05.988 --> 00:50:09.650]  We were up here late last night waiting for the final announcement to go down.
[00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:20.098]  And instead of going home, I found a couch over in an office and took a couple hours nap.
[00:50:21.019 --> 00:50:21.799]  Well, go ahead, Gracie.
[00:50:21.819 --> 00:50:22.580]  What were you going to say?
[00:50:23.761 --> 00:50:28.284]  I'm a nurse and I work in emergency.
[00:50:29.142 --> 00:50:37.589]  And I've noticed over the last 10 years, a lot of our patients are now foreigners.
[00:50:37.609 --> 00:50:40.352]  And they all have Medicaid.
[00:50:42.013 --> 00:50:52.402]  They all have TB, MRSA, you know, a lot of our Asian patients come in with really serious cancer.
[00:50:55.083 --> 00:51:07.794]  Their whole family are coming in with these really, really, really serious cases and it's really, it's like odd diseases coming in like dengue fever or like plague, you know.
[00:51:09.555 --> 00:51:15.260]  So these people are coming in with like all these like illnesses or they're not being checked.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:20.184]  What, you know, is this, you know, is this something like we can get a grip on at some point?
[00:51:21.827 --> 00:51:30.132]  I look around when I'm at work, and I say, hey, all these people are here, but they're all super sick, and these are the ones we chose to come here?
[00:51:32.454 --> 00:51:35.176]  Well, they're coming here probably for the medical system.
[00:51:35.436 --> 00:51:49.905]  We have to get that health care, and they've been told if they get here, they can apply for assistance and get that assistance, and once again, we're paying for other people from other countries to come here and get a free ride.
[00:51:53.495 --> 00:51:58.578]  It's very frustrating to watch, like, people who can't buy into the Obamacare because it's so expensive.
[00:51:58.858 --> 00:51:59.839]  Yeah.
[00:52:00.139 --> 00:52:03.381]  And it's going up, you know, year by year by year, it's going up.
[00:52:03.401 --> 00:52:06.522]  It's getting harder and harder to find the same doctors at the same hospital.
[00:52:07.343 --> 00:52:16.648]  And they're, you know, you're charging a healthy, you know, I have a friend, she's in charge of a healthy young woman, she's a lawyer, sweet girl, you know, charging $8 a month.
[00:52:17.408 --> 00:52:20.530]  And her doctor doesn't say anything about the hospital that she can go to.
[00:52:22.311 --> 00:52:22.491]  Yeah.
[00:52:24.662 --> 00:52:27.865]  And the costs of health care are out of control?
[00:52:29.426 --> 00:52:32.149]  Because they're not having to compete as much?
[00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:35.852]  And because they're tied down with these insurance companies?
[00:52:36.292 --> 00:52:37.033]  With paperwork?
[00:52:38.434 --> 00:52:48.664]  I sit there, I watch all these people come into the hospital and get, you know, $50,000, you know, what it would be for a $50,000 bill, basically sent to Medicaid.
[00:52:51.087 --> 00:52:54.789]  And actually, they're getting better treatment than we are.
[00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:57.871]  As Americans, we're getting not as good treatment.
[00:52:58.912 --> 00:52:59.012]  Sure.
[00:52:59.032 --> 00:53:00.753]  Everything in the Medicaid is free.
[00:53:00.993 --> 00:53:02.775]  Even Tylenol is free.
[00:53:03.715 --> 00:53:04.196]  Everything.
[00:53:06.217 --> 00:53:08.698]  The emergency room visit is free.
[00:53:08.718 --> 00:53:10.860]  I mean, equipment that you need to have is free.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:12.101]  Physical therapy is free.
[00:53:12.121 --> 00:53:14.182]  You don't have to pay for any prescriptions.
[00:53:14.742 --> 00:53:16.403]  Everything is really, really free.
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:21.541]  How did we let this come to this?
[00:53:24.121 --> 00:53:39.367]  Because we're a benevolent country and we got taken over by people who saw the system as a means to enrich themselves and by enriching themselves they say if we give people a little bit they'll keep us in power.
[00:53:42.284 --> 00:53:49.286]  And I think last night we proved that our country's sick and tired of giving away something and not getting anything in return.
[00:53:49.306 --> 00:53:50.966]  I think that's what you're seeing.
[00:53:53.307 --> 00:53:55.328]  It was a direct repudiation of that.
[00:53:55.368 --> 00:53:56.868]  Did you vote yesterday?
[00:53:56.888 --> 00:54:01.409]  I did, absolutely.
[00:54:01.929 --> 00:54:05.730]  New York went pretty quick to Hillary Clinton.
[00:54:06.091 --> 00:54:11.032]  I honestly truly thought New York would at least be close, and I won't go with Trump.
[00:54:12.244 --> 00:54:27.649]  What a lot of people don't get about New Yorkers is that we're not too all stressed out, running around, and we don't fluff things up at all.
[00:54:27.749 --> 00:54:34.572]  And a lot of people, I don't know, maybe they find it fun, so they'll put off, because in New York, we just say it like it is.
[00:54:35.392 --> 00:54:36.993]  If it looks like a dog, it's a duck.
[00:54:39.048 --> 00:54:43.290]  You know, it's not, you know, if she looks like a clown, she acts like a clown, she's a clown.
[00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:44.011]  It's Hillary.
[00:54:44.831 --> 00:54:48.053]  And when a First Lady moves to your state, you make her a Senator.
[00:54:50.074 --> 00:54:58.559]  Of course, you know, if a duck is quite like a duckle, it touches little children and it goes to ritual, well it must be a Senator, we put her in New York.
[00:54:59.139 --> 00:55:04.422]  I mean, I don't, you know, she's a New Yorker, she's not, she's not like us.
[00:55:05.393 --> 00:55:10.955]  You know, maybe people are like, you know, let me just take a step back.
[00:55:11.035 --> 00:55:13.056]  People in New York have a lot of values.
[00:55:13.557 --> 00:55:23.461]  We have to deal with a lot of, you know, different things and there is a sense of community where people will jump in and help you if it's right.
[00:55:23.721 --> 00:55:33.205]  People will, you know, help Little East Cross Street, you know, but New Yorkers aren't all mean or cutthroat and not everybody in New York is that, right?
[00:55:33.712 --> 00:55:36.794]  I live in the only part of New York City that is Republican.
[00:55:37.834 --> 00:55:39.715]  You know, so not everybody is Democrat.
[00:55:39.896 --> 00:55:42.537]  There's a lot of very, very conservative places here.
[00:55:42.637 --> 00:55:50.121]  You know, I'm looking at the map right now, and it's very few counties that were Democrat, mainly around the big cities.
[00:55:51.142 --> 00:55:52.923]  New York City, but Long Island.
[00:55:54.664 --> 00:55:56.125]  You know, he won 52 to 44 at Albany.
[00:56:00.866 --> 00:56:05.629]  Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, all went to Hillary.
[00:56:08.151 --> 00:56:10.292]  And, you know, by significant margins.
[00:56:12.033 --> 00:56:12.834]  So it's interesting.
[00:56:12.894 --> 00:56:17.277]  It seems like people in the big cities still believe that Democrats are going to take care of them.
[00:56:19.218 --> 00:56:25.502]  And what people need to learn, and you would think New York, people who live in New York City would know this, that, you know, you have to take care of yourself.
[00:56:25.662 --> 00:56:29.805]  Nobody's going to pick you up and get you on the subway and
[00:56:31.414 --> 00:56:33.855]  Gets you to your job, and you gotta do that yourself.
[00:56:33.916 --> 00:56:35.577]  I'm surprised in New Jersey, personally.
[00:56:37.998 --> 00:56:41.840]  The way the system's set up now is that they don't have to worry about anything.
[00:56:42.901 --> 00:56:44.802]  Everything's taken care of.
[00:56:44.942 --> 00:56:51.086]  They'll get a ride to the hospital, they'll get all their treatments, they'll have the prescription meds, they'll eat something at home.
[00:56:51.706 --> 00:56:54.068]  You know, you don't have to lift a finger.
[00:56:54.088 --> 00:56:54.668]  We'll get you a job.
[00:56:54.688 --> 00:56:55.689]  Everything is done for them.
[00:57:01.653 --> 00:57:05.494]  Well, I think you're going to see some of that change, and I hope soon.
[00:57:06.574 --> 00:57:14.376]  And I hope we can change the way we do business as a country, the way we provide services for a country.
[00:57:14.456 --> 00:57:20.537]  And I truly believe we have enough money to give people a helping hand when they need it.
[00:57:20.617 --> 00:57:22.598]  We have more than enough money to do that.
[00:57:23.838 --> 00:57:30.680]  We're brimming with money, but we're letting bankers and multinational companies come in and take it.
[00:57:31.496 --> 00:57:35.957]  We'll let them take our resources without proper compensation.
[00:57:36.258 --> 00:57:42.479]  You know, one thing I've noticed in New York City, there's a great middle class in New York.
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:48.882]  And I think in New York City, most of the city is pretty much would be considered a decent middle class.
[00:57:49.842 --> 00:57:53.743]  And housing is affordable in certain areas.
[00:57:53.763 --> 00:57:56.524]  So maybe not in the middle of Midtown Manhattan or on Wall Street,
[00:57:56.997 --> 00:58:03.800]  But if you want to go a little ways out, you can find somewhat affordable housing.
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:12.704]  If you drive around where the fancy area of the Barclays Center is and downtown Brooklyn, how they're doing Coney Island up.
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:32.908]  You kind of turn and you're seeing all these prices skyrocketing and all these affordable house care buildings are being knocked down and they're set up in luxury condominiums with gyms on the first floor and cinema in the back and its own pharmacy and its own writing and its own whatever.
[00:58:33.368 --> 00:58:39.811]  And they're selling them for a little apartment, one bedroom apartment, maybe $8 million.
[00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:44.572]  Who, and they're putting up, like, crunches on them.
[00:58:44.772 --> 00:58:46.472]  Who can afford to live in these places?
[00:58:46.812 --> 00:58:48.853]  You know, it's interesting.
[00:58:48.913 --> 00:59:09.177]  If you look at a map, the most expensive places to live in our country, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York City, Maryland, around the Beltway in Virginia, California, Portland, Seattle, those places all went Democrat.
[00:59:09.257 --> 00:59:11.037]  The most expensive places to live.
[00:59:14.588 --> 00:59:16.049]  Then you go down to the Texas map.
[00:59:16.189 --> 00:59:19.172]  You can see it's San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, Houston.
[00:59:21.174 --> 00:59:22.955]  Even El Paso went for Hillary.
[00:59:24.397 --> 00:59:25.257]  By a large margin.
[00:59:30.202 --> 00:59:34.766]  So, it's just... These are all things we need to look at at this point.
[00:59:34.826 --> 00:59:36.047]  Because yeah, our guy won.
[00:59:38.989 --> 00:59:41.692]  The guy that I didn't think the system would let be president
[00:59:43.871 --> 00:59:44.792]  They let him slip in.
[00:59:44.812 --> 00:59:51.019]  I'm worried that they are... I'm worried they're going to try to assassinate him.
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:51.960]  Yeah.
[00:59:53.402 --> 00:59:57.427]  That's something... Assassinate him or, you know, we got a video we're about to go to.
[00:59:58.953 --> 01:00:03.176]  That I shot with Alex Jones at about 2.30, 2.40 last night.
[01:00:03.396 --> 01:00:05.777]  Globalists to attack Trump with economic collapse.
[01:00:05.837 --> 01:00:07.578]  I mean, that's something we really have to look out for.
[01:00:07.618 --> 01:00:12.421]  I was watching MSNBC and Chris Hayes was saying, oh, the markets aren't doing very well.
[01:00:12.461 --> 01:00:16.004]  They even shut down this overnight trading system because it had gone, it had dropped more than 5%.
[01:00:18.065 --> 01:00:19.586]  So they're going to hit us with that this morning.
[01:00:19.626 --> 01:00:22.848]  In fact, it's probably already being posted somewhere.
[01:00:26.454 --> 01:00:27.275]  Wow.
[01:00:28.055 --> 01:00:29.396]  So, you say you're a nurse, right?
[01:00:30.216 --> 01:00:30.496]  Yes.
[01:00:30.657 --> 01:00:38.081]  Grace, how many flu shots do you pass out at this time of year?
[01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:40.682]  Anybody and everybody.
[01:00:41.002 --> 01:00:42.723]  Yeah.
[01:00:42.763 --> 01:00:48.727]  The policy of the hospital is, you know, we're to offer it to all patients and staff.
[01:00:49.307 --> 01:00:53.970]  If a staff member, like, you know, I work with right-hand garment patients,
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:01:06.344]  If I'm to continue in that capacity, I have to either take your shot or I have to wear a special mask every time I walk in and out of the building.
[01:01:06.905 --> 01:01:07.165]  Right.
[01:01:07.625 --> 01:01:08.645]  And so what do you do?
[01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.326]  Do you take the shot or do you wear the mask?
[01:01:11.066 --> 01:01:11.767]  I wear the mask.
[01:01:12.047 --> 01:01:12.867]  Yeah, that's good.
[01:01:13.927 --> 01:01:15.368]  You're still thinking for yourself.
[01:01:16.516 --> 01:01:17.837]  Well, I would say it's like this.
[01:01:18.117 --> 01:01:21.820]  I'm in front of every kind of disease every day.
[01:01:22.301 --> 01:01:23.082]  All kinds of things.
[01:01:23.142 --> 01:01:24.263]  You know, I'm faced with it.
[01:01:24.463 --> 01:01:34.751]  And, you know, when we get so hardy, you know, when you keep your kids inside and you don't let them, you know, like, you know, experience some germs, you can get some kind of immunity to it.
[01:01:34.931 --> 01:01:42.158]  You know, I mean, I'm like that, you know, I have a great, great immunity because of being around so much, you know, ailments.
[01:01:42.278 --> 01:01:44.620]  I don't believe, you know, and even if I did get the flu,
[01:01:45.424 --> 01:01:53.627]  No, I'm healthy, and I don't think that, you know, why do that to yourself?
[01:01:54.147 --> 01:01:55.788]  Right.
[01:01:55.808 --> 01:02:08.413]  Why would you put into your body something that you don't know what it is really, or something that you may never get, and even if you did, it wouldn't be all awful.
[01:02:08.953 --> 01:02:11.134]  You just not feel good for doing it.
[01:02:11.714 --> 01:02:12.074]  Right.
[01:02:12.114 --> 01:02:12.854]  And you get over it.
[01:02:12.994 --> 01:02:14.235]  So why would you even, like,
[01:02:15.402 --> 01:02:19.405]  Why would you even take a chance on all the side effects?
[01:02:19.545 --> 01:02:22.847]  Every single patient I inoculate says the same thing.
[01:02:22.867 --> 01:02:37.456]  Two or three days later, my head hurts, the injection site hurts, now I can't sleep, I feel like I'm getting sick and nauseous, I'm vomiting, and they just never are the same again.
[01:02:38.237 --> 01:02:41.839]  It's like something goes off on their body, it's like their body's off.
[01:02:50.526 --> 01:02:57.572]  Well, we've got a presentation I'm going to dig out and play probably a little bit after 930 today, Central Time.
[01:02:58.253 --> 01:03:00.675]  Dr. Group spent 20 minutes yesterday going over
[01:03:02.438 --> 01:03:12.727]  The new flu vaccine that they're now offering and really pushing on old people and the horrible ingredients it's got in it and the side effects he's been seeing.
[01:03:12.767 --> 01:03:17.231]  People coming to him after getting it having big time problems.
[01:03:19.032 --> 01:03:20.013]  So we're going to play that.
[01:03:20.093 --> 01:03:22.175]  So tell the people you know to tune in.
[01:03:22.255 --> 01:03:24.177]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:03:25.998 --> 01:03:28.539]  Play a little, a little bit over half an hour from now.
[01:03:28.599 --> 01:03:29.739]  But I want to go to this video now.
[01:03:29.759 --> 01:03:30.699]  Do you have this video ready?
[01:03:31.019 --> 01:03:33.380]  Marcos, globalists to attack Trump with economic collapse.
[01:03:34.441 --> 01:03:34.681]  Okay.
[01:03:36.961 --> 01:03:37.261]  All right.
[01:03:37.301 --> 01:03:38.962]  Yeah, this is a video we shot last night.
[01:03:39.122 --> 01:03:40.222]  It's about 10 minutes long.
[01:03:42.863 --> 01:03:45.604]  And while you're listening to this video, check out
[01:03:46.897 --> 01:03:50.019]  InfoWarsLife.com, where we have our InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:03:50.039 --> 01:04:12.193]  We have some amazing deals, free shipping store-wide, 30% off Super Male Vitality and free shipping, 30% off DNA Force, 30 to 40% off InfoWars Select Storable Food, 30% off Survival Shield X2, 30% off Pro Pure King Water Filters, 25% off Secret 12, and 15% off Molon Lobby Apparel.
[01:04:12.213 --> 01:04:13.354]  And there's other deals out there.
[01:04:13.374 --> 01:04:16.456]  I think there's a really good deal on Silver Bullet.
[01:04:19.414 --> 01:04:21.536]  Grace, do you use colloidal silver?
[01:04:21.597 --> 01:04:23.078]  Have you ever heard of that before?
[01:04:23.098 --> 01:04:24.380]  No.
[01:04:27.443 --> 01:04:28.044]  I'm surprised.
[01:04:28.084 --> 01:04:31.047]  Well, you've heard of silver sulfidate?
[01:04:31.208 --> 01:04:32.769]  They put in babies' eyes when they're born?
[01:04:34.311 --> 01:04:35.072]  Sort of the same thing.
[01:04:35.132 --> 01:04:37.535]  It's got silver in it and that's to keep out
[01:04:38.797 --> 01:04:50.543]  You know, bacteria and viruses and colloidal silvers made by running an electrical charge through silver rods in distilled water, essentially, and ionizing the silver into the water.
[01:04:51.824 --> 01:04:54.705]  And people, I've been using it for 10, 11 years now.
[01:04:54.945 --> 01:04:56.486]  I don't get sick all that much.
[01:04:56.546 --> 01:04:58.147]  I did get sick a couple times this year.
[01:05:00.248 --> 01:05:04.170]  But it's a natural antibiotic.
[01:05:05.211 --> 01:05:06.972]  Instead of having to put antibiotics into your body,
[01:05:09.958 --> 01:05:11.858]  Some people use silver.
[01:05:13.359 --> 01:05:17.400]  And we have colloidal silver at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:18.300]  It's called Silver Bullet.
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:19.680]  Grace, thanks for calling.
[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:21.861]  Thanks for laying all that information on us.
[01:05:21.881 --> 01:05:22.981]  We're going to go to this video now.
[01:05:23.041 --> 01:05:25.362]  Globalists to attack Trump with economic collapse.
[01:05:26.182 --> 01:05:29.723]  And when we come back, we'll take more of your calls and see what's going on in the news.
[01:05:29.763 --> 01:05:38.325]  I've got no stacks of news in front of me, so I'm just kind of hodgepodging around the internet and kind of reflecting on what happened last night as we saw Donald Trump
[01:05:39.485 --> 01:05:42.546]  Become the next President of the United States of America.
[01:05:42.626 --> 01:05:48.349]  And I truly think he was very humble when he took the stage last night, finally, at 1.30.
[01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:52.291]  It was chaos here.
[01:05:52.811 --> 01:06:00.435]  We had a film crew who had come in following Roger Stone around and they were adamant about coming in and sharing this moment with him.
[01:06:01.515 --> 01:06:02.836]  And it was interesting.
[01:06:02.876 --> 01:06:06.718]  They were doing a documentary for Netflix, I believe, so it was...
[01:06:08.595 --> 01:06:12.558]  It's pretty weird to have another film crew in here.
[01:06:13.579 --> 01:06:15.280]  We have Gary in Kansas.
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:16.281]  You stay there.
[01:06:16.301 --> 01:06:24.527]  We're going to take about a 10-minute break to listen to what Alex has to say about how the globalists are going to counterattack the coup by the people.
[01:06:25.287 --> 01:06:27.048]  We've come back and taken power back.
[01:06:27.069 --> 01:06:31.472]  You can see it's going to be by a larger margin than what they're showing right now.
[01:06:32.612 --> 01:06:33.272]  Stay tuned for that.
[01:06:33.292 --> 01:06:33.933]  We'll be right back.
[01:06:33.993 --> 01:06:38.555]  Infowars.com forward slash show is the free stream.
[01:06:38.575 --> 01:06:40.436]  Please spread that link around.
[01:06:40.456 --> 01:06:42.818]  It's by people out there like you.
[01:06:42.878 --> 01:06:43.718]  Spread the link around.
[01:06:43.758 --> 01:06:46.280]  Look, the work has just begun.
[01:06:49.622 --> 01:06:51.823]  We can rest on our laurels for one, maybe two days.
[01:06:53.744 --> 01:06:54.944]  But then we got a lot of work to do.
[01:06:56.345 --> 01:07:00.688]  To fix this country and make it the beacon of the world that it once was.
[01:07:01.758 --> 01:07:04.140]  And that's a beacon for everybody.
[01:07:04.501 --> 01:07:08.745]  It's not a beacon for a certain class of people or a certain race of people.
[01:07:09.266 --> 01:07:10.066]  It's for everybody.
[01:07:10.247 --> 01:07:11.248]  That's what this country is for.
[01:07:11.548 --> 01:07:25.502]  This country is going to be great and we're going to show the world how we can lead and how we can lift up everyone in the world and show them what freedom and prosperity is all about.
[01:07:27.665 --> 01:07:35.330]  So, hopefully you will join us in this quest as we go in the next chapter of this grand experiment we call the United States of America.
[01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:36.551]  Stay tuned, we'll be right back.
[01:07:36.571 --> 01:07:37.571]  This is Rob Dew reporting.
[01:07:37.611 --> 01:07:42.194]  You can follow me on Twitter at DewsNews, D-E-W-S, N-E-W-S-E.
[01:07:43.015 --> 01:07:43.655]  Thanks for watching.
[01:07:44.956 --> 01:07:52.841]  It's almost 3 o'clock in the morning Central Time, and we now have President-elect Donald Trump.
[01:07:55.482 --> 01:07:56.103]  Donald Trump
[01:07:58.134 --> 01:08:09.461]  He's no angel, and neither am I. But Donald Trump's will is that you be prosperous and that you be successful.
[01:08:10.782 --> 01:08:14.864]  Donald Trump is not satanic.
[01:08:16.285 --> 01:08:18.046]  He does not want to see you poor.
[01:08:19.827 --> 01:08:22.029]  He does not wish to ground you under his treads.
[01:08:23.424 --> 01:08:28.527]  And that's why Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan and all the big mega banks have set themselves up against him.
[01:08:29.067 --> 01:08:30.488]  Because they believe they own you.
[01:08:33.029 --> 01:08:35.611]  I knew a year and a half ago when I endorsed Donald Trump he was going to win.
[01:08:35.631 --> 01:08:41.854]  And I've talked to him about why I knew that.
[01:08:43.976 --> 01:08:50.019]  But people I know, and people I trust, that are patriots, that have defended this republic,
[01:08:52.679 --> 01:09:00.062]  Confirmed to me, and I've seen it in Donald Trump's actions, that he wanted to restore this republic.
[01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:01.623]  But I want to be very clear to you.
[01:09:02.623 --> 01:09:03.164]  Very clear.
[01:09:05.024 --> 01:09:06.265]  This isn't about credit.
[01:09:06.545 --> 01:09:08.026]  It's so that you know the danger.
[01:09:10.607 --> 01:09:14.108]  You've seen the stupid ads with the bunny rabbit that says Energizer inside?
[01:09:15.549 --> 01:09:19.891]  If you want to know what powers Donald Trump, individually it's the love of liberty.
[01:09:21.257 --> 01:09:23.139]  In a love of standing up to corruption.
[01:09:23.299 --> 01:09:24.300]  He's not perfect, nobody is.
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:27.322]  But what powers the movement is Infowars.
[01:09:30.145 --> 01:09:32.847]  They want to establish a private corporate global government.
[01:09:34.749 --> 01:09:43.737]  Nigel Farage, the leader of UKIP, would come on my show 15 years ago when he barely had a few members of parliament.
[01:09:43.977 --> 01:09:45.299]  Now he's 100 times bigger and more.
[01:09:46.274 --> 01:09:49.175]  And he would say, it's your listeners listening to you in the U.S.
[01:09:49.195 --> 01:09:51.396]  when I go knock on doors, that's why we're getting the U.K.
[01:09:51.416 --> 01:09:52.156]  Independence Party.
[01:09:52.236 --> 01:09:52.877]  It's InfoWars.
[01:09:53.097 --> 01:09:53.457]  Thank you.
[01:09:54.277 --> 01:09:55.118]  He said that on the show.
[01:09:55.578 --> 01:10:01.380]  It's not about us bragging, it's that the spirit of the InfoWars across the world, from Australia to the U.K.
[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:05.642]  and Russia, from Nigeria to Mexico, is spreading.
[01:10:08.283 --> 01:10:10.804]  And it's the Renaissance idea of freedom.
[01:10:12.011 --> 01:10:14.472]  And that's why they're trying to shut us down.
[01:10:15.032 --> 01:10:18.153]  Because we're not perfect, but we're not out to get people.
[01:10:18.453 --> 01:10:19.794]  We believe in lower taxes.
[01:10:20.194 --> 01:10:22.335]  We know empowering the people is the answer.
[01:10:23.175 --> 01:10:24.555]  We don't want to break up families.
[01:10:25.636 --> 01:10:26.876]  We're not out to get people.
[01:10:29.737 --> 01:10:32.798]  And Donald Trump is not out to get you.
[01:10:33.598 --> 01:10:33.918]  That's all.
[01:10:35.239 --> 01:10:41.261]  He's not some weird asshole that wants you to abort your kid, or take a dangerous vaccine, or submit to their system.
[01:10:42.847 --> 01:10:46.070]  Now that said, it's 3 o'clock in the morning, I'm going to shut this down, I'm exhausted.
[01:10:46.771 --> 01:10:48.813]  But this historic occasion has happened, I should warn you.
[01:10:52.357 --> 01:10:55.160]  Donald Trump is more a figurehead of liberty than ever before.
[01:10:58.123 --> 01:11:00.886]  And he has the Holy Ghost protecting him.
[01:11:02.127 --> 01:11:05.531]  And no weapon formed against him will prosper, as long as we pray for him.
[01:11:11.738 --> 01:11:13.860]  And the evil of the globalists is ongoing.
[01:11:15.541 --> 01:11:17.223]  Donald Trump isn't some panacea.
[01:11:17.503 --> 01:11:19.365]  He's only a manifestation of our awakening.
[01:11:20.205 --> 01:11:22.588]  So listen to me, and I'm going to close this out.
[01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:28.633]  They are going to try to collapse the world economy.
[01:11:28.653 --> 01:11:30.254]  They've already been propping it up for a while.
[01:11:30.615 --> 01:11:32.376]  They're going to blame it on Donald Trump.
[01:11:32.937 --> 01:11:33.857]  A global depression.
[01:11:34.398 --> 01:11:35.779]  They knew they couldn't stop the movement.
[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:37.421]  So now that he's in,
[01:11:38.356 --> 01:11:42.137]  They're going to implode the economy and blame him when they're the ones who created the derivatives.
[01:11:42.978 --> 01:11:45.499]  When they're the ones who created the end of Glass-Steagall.
[01:11:45.539 --> 01:11:47.780]  When Hillary Clinton and Larry Summers did it all.
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.240]  They're going to blame Donald Trump.
[01:11:52.361 --> 01:11:53.021]  How do I know that?
[01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:54.122]  They threatened the UK.
[01:11:54.142 --> 01:11:57.103]  They said, you try to leave this unelected thing, we'll implode your economy.
[01:11:57.283 --> 01:11:58.203]  We'll take your jobs away.
[01:11:58.223 --> 01:11:59.784]  Just like they did in Iceland or Greece.
[01:12:00.264 --> 01:12:01.645]  Some countries fold, some fight back.
[01:12:02.205 --> 01:12:03.065]  We know their plan.
[01:12:03.505 --> 01:12:05.966]  If you're just conscious and want to know the truth, it's all there.
[01:12:06.827 --> 01:12:07.527]  It's not my opinion.
[01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:10.592]  I want self-determination.
[01:12:10.612 --> 01:12:11.633]  I won't be held hostage.
[01:12:14.395 --> 01:12:25.143]  So, this isn't like buying a lottery ticket, where you elect Donald Trump and beat the establishment and then expect the whole gravy train to continue on.
[01:12:26.024 --> 01:12:27.325]  Who wants this fake gravy train?
[01:12:28.766 --> 01:12:31.308]  We need to get back to what makes us human, what makes us real.
[01:12:31.849 --> 01:12:34.791]  And if we're getting ahead of the expense of some third world people, we shouldn't do it.
[01:12:36.572 --> 01:12:38.714]  If we're getting ahead of the expense of our kids, we shouldn't do it.
[01:12:40.913 --> 01:12:48.035]  Donald Trump, for all his gold-plated planes and everything he does, his sin is that he doesn't have to get you.
[01:12:49.776 --> 01:12:55.578]  I saw the enemy truly against Donald Trump, spiritually hating him, so I backed him.
[01:12:58.298 --> 01:13:02.740]  And I've interviewed him on air, I've talked to Donald Trump, but I've talked to other people.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:03.980]  I've talked to other presidents.
[01:13:05.001 --> 01:13:07.581]  Governor Bush tried to get me to work with him.
[01:13:07.641 --> 01:13:09.202]  I didn't do it because he wasn't a good man.
[01:13:11.618 --> 01:13:17.200]  Trump, my spirit tells me, needs to be supported.
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:24.622]  And he can falter, he can waver, but all of us are prodigal sons.
[01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:30.104]  And I can tell you, if you want freedom, it's not free.
[01:13:31.344 --> 01:13:32.425]  The storm is coming now.
[01:13:33.285 --> 01:13:39.627]  This victory is part of the destiny of the Republic.
[01:13:42.563 --> 01:13:57.636]  This country is the vision of incredibly pure people who wanted to build up society and create a launch pad for the technology we now enjoy.
[01:13:57.656 --> 01:14:08.946]  And they believe we would be pure and appreciate this technology in their incredible crystal visions and not a bunch of lazy assholes.
[01:14:11.363 --> 01:14:13.844]  So let's make those pilgrims right.
[01:14:15.665 --> 01:14:19.507]  And let's build what they envisioned, because we're their children.
[01:14:21.007 --> 01:14:27.350]  And let's never look down on people that aren't as smart as us, and are weak, and say, use them as animals, they're dumb.
[01:14:28.191 --> 01:14:31.392]  Because the minute we stoop down to do that, we become cannibals.
[01:14:32.353 --> 01:14:33.173]  We lose our humanity.
[01:14:36.604 --> 01:14:40.106]  It's not some New Age term, because they use this term, but it's God.
[01:14:40.146 --> 01:14:46.809]  It's Christ energy is dumping into this planet right now.
[01:14:48.009 --> 01:14:56.994]  We're being bathed in the ambionic fluid of the birth of something magic.
[01:14:59.014 --> 01:15:04.217]  But all of us, individually, have to collectively decide
[01:15:05.762 --> 01:15:08.564]  We want to give birth to what God talked about in the Bible.
[01:15:09.284 --> 01:15:11.206]  The eye has not seen, the ear has not heard.
[01:15:11.226 --> 01:15:16.349]  We have to decide we care.
[01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:19.371]  And we can do anything.
[01:15:20.732 --> 01:15:21.332]  Anything we want.
[01:15:23.613 --> 01:15:24.874]  But we can't hurt the innocent.
[01:15:27.096 --> 01:15:28.316]  Alright, I'm done talking.
[01:15:28.356 --> 01:15:28.937]  I'm exhausted.
[01:15:28.997 --> 01:15:29.757]  It's 2.43.
[01:15:30.538 --> 01:15:33.080]  I want to thank you, Josh.
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:35.201]  I want to thank this whole crew, the viewers and listeners.
[01:15:38.815 --> 01:15:40.477]  And I may not have all the answers.
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:49.726]  But thank God I'm not one of these people like Lady Gaga and John Podesta and all the stuff they're doing.
[01:15:49.746 --> 01:15:56.412]  Can you imagine being so fallen that you think corrupting children gives you power?
[01:15:57.833 --> 01:16:00.876]  You're like burning your own hardware up, your own circuitry.
[01:16:00.896 --> 01:16:02.798]  You think, oh, I'm dying spiritually.
[01:16:02.918 --> 01:16:03.639]  Oh, I've got power.
[01:16:09.261 --> 01:16:14.485]  But it's our weakness and subservience to them that let them think they were God.
[01:16:16.326 --> 01:16:25.753]  And I realize it's those of us that have the spark of creativity and intellect that give in to these people that are their enablers.
[01:16:27.435 --> 01:16:33.639]  And the fact that we won't take control and rule and build is our fault.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.802]  We are the real people that did all this.
[01:16:38.513 --> 01:16:44.337]  By creating a vacuum and putting these demons in control, we ceded control.
[01:16:44.757 --> 01:16:46.098]  We committed the crimes.
[01:16:46.759 --> 01:16:47.839]  I committed the crimes.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.962]  And I will no longer commit those crimes.
[01:16:53.283 --> 01:16:57.506]  It's time to take charge of this third dimension and beyond.
[01:16:59.688 --> 01:17:04.231]  Donald Trump is only a childlike, as we all are, manifestation of this.
[01:17:06.837 --> 01:17:10.339]  We have the keys to the universe because God gave them to us.
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:13.121]  God, who has dreams for us.
[01:17:13.541 --> 01:17:14.501]  God, who loves us.
[01:17:15.222 --> 01:17:17.243]  God, who gave us knowledge of good and evil.
[01:17:18.324 --> 01:17:23.607]  But we must thank God, and then take those keys in our hands, and have the will to open those doors.
[01:17:26.728 --> 01:17:34.133]  The big challenge now comes, because the promise to this country, in Providence, was of Iulia Cherdes,
[01:17:35.492 --> 01:17:36.973]  You'll ask God, you'll get it.
[01:17:38.874 --> 01:17:44.939]  But if we now don't deliver, you don't ask God for providence here to not deliver.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.481]  Now we are bound forever.
[01:17:48.101 --> 01:17:55.346]  And if we don't deliver this plan and free humanity, we will be bound to the ninth circle of hell.
[01:17:57.588 --> 01:18:01.611]  I'm bound to this truth and I will never stop delivering.
[01:18:03.376 --> 01:18:08.920]  It's time for you to transcend Hollywood and all these other weak people and submit yourself to God.
[01:18:09.361 --> 01:18:11.262]  You won't find God in these schools.
[01:18:11.662 --> 01:18:13.283]  You won't find God in these churches.
[01:18:13.864 --> 01:18:14.965]  They're all there to deflect.
[01:18:15.805 --> 01:18:18.768]  You're going to find God in your heart.
[01:18:20.089 --> 01:18:20.609]  I've said it.
[01:18:21.450 --> 01:18:22.370]  I've already run my course.
[01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:25.993]  I already know my entire life purpose has been completed.
[01:18:26.353 --> 01:18:27.154]  I will continue on.
[01:18:27.734 --> 01:18:31.117]  But now, I realize I've won.
[01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:38.491]  And that was Alex Jones at 240 last night.
[01:18:40.912 --> 01:18:42.332]  I didn't think he was going to celebrate.
[01:18:42.372 --> 01:18:44.213]  He was serious the whole time.
[01:18:44.273 --> 01:18:50.655]  It looked like, you know, Trump still had it and Trump was going to win and we were just waiting for either Wisconsin or Pennsylvania to break.
[01:18:51.735 --> 01:18:59.158]  And Alex was still on task, on task.
[01:19:00.126 --> 01:19:01.547]  And I didn't even want to believe it.
[01:19:02.067 --> 01:19:04.789]  I was not going to celebrate until I saw it.
[01:19:04.809 --> 01:19:10.073]  Around the world, here's Marine Le Pen.
[01:19:11.234 --> 01:19:13.256]  Their world is crumbling, ours is building.
[01:19:13.736 --> 01:19:20.801]  French far right, including national front leader Marine Le Pen, declared Trump election a victory for populist politics.
[01:19:22.122 --> 01:19:22.862]  They're in France.
[01:19:24.103 --> 01:19:25.965]  They've seen what happened in the Brexit as well.
[01:19:28.843 --> 01:19:31.744]  Speaking of the Brexit, we now have a president who likes our country.
[01:19:31.804 --> 01:19:39.087]  Nigel Farage gloats over Donald Trump's victory as he flies to America today in a bid to be Donald's ambassador to the EU.
[01:19:42.148 --> 01:19:45.550]  He says he'd do the job of a Brussels ambassador very well.
[01:19:47.951 --> 01:19:52.292]  And he tells the Agenda Show he's booked flights for Wednesday morning, so he's flying here.
[01:19:52.332 --> 01:19:53.633]  Nigel Farage is coming back.
[01:19:55.333 --> 01:19:56.633]  Into the United States.
[01:19:56.693 --> 01:20:01.275]  We got to meet him in person in, uh, in Cleveland.
[01:20:03.936 --> 01:20:08.317]  And he's, you know, he's just a guy who wanted freedom.
[01:20:11.398 --> 01:20:13.339]  Gary, I've left you holding there long enough.
[01:20:13.359 --> 01:20:21.002]  You're my last caller that I'm going to take, and I'm sure the next host who comes out, I believe it's Paul Joseph Watson, comes in at 10, about 40 minutes.
[01:20:21.742 --> 01:20:22.882]  He might take some more calls.
[01:20:23.242 --> 01:20:24.443]  I'm sure Owen went through the
[01:20:25.393 --> 01:20:26.274]  The ringer on calls.
[01:20:26.294 --> 01:20:27.334]  But Gary, go ahead.
[01:20:27.354 --> 01:20:35.279]  You want to talk about the NBC article, I guess, that had Russian cyber fears?
[01:20:35.699 --> 01:20:37.000]  Everybody was worried about the Russians.
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:39.561]  They're the only ones that can hack an election at this point.
[01:20:40.122 --> 01:20:41.102]  Go ahead, Gary.
[01:20:42.543 --> 01:20:43.384]  Hey, Rob.
[01:20:43.424 --> 01:20:45.105]  I appreciate you guys taking my call.
[01:20:45.265 --> 01:20:50.308]  And before I get into it, I just want to say y'all have my blessing to take weeks R&R after this is done.
[01:20:52.688 --> 01:20:53.989]  Appreciate what you guys have done.
[01:20:55.130 --> 01:21:06.359]  But yeah, I saw the report yesterday where NBC came out and said that we had our cyber forces trained on Russia because they were going to fiddle with the election or something.
[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:06.900]  Right.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.981]  And I hadn't heard anything since then.
[01:21:09.001 --> 01:21:16.728]  I don't know if you all knew if they'd gotten the stand down order on that yet or if we're still eyeing those guys.
[01:21:17.893 --> 01:21:21.014]  I haven't heard Russia mentioned like I thought I would.
[01:21:21.694 --> 01:21:33.178]  You know, I think with all the talk and people looking at election fraud and having Bev Harris on and beating that drum that these electronic voting machines can be hacked.
[01:21:35.859 --> 01:21:37.239]  I think maybe people stood down.
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:41.641]  Although the results in California are very suspicious.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:43.520]  You look at California.
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:50.262]  Trump got less votes than Mitt Romney, and I guarantee you he had way larger rallies than Mitt Romney.
[01:21:52.602 --> 01:21:53.702]  Guys, bring up that article again.
[01:21:53.722 --> 01:21:54.623]  I want to read that.
[01:21:54.683 --> 01:21:55.123]  Government.
[01:21:55.643 --> 01:21:55.803]  U.S.
[01:21:55.823 --> 01:21:58.964]  government hackers ready to hit back if Russia tries to disrupt the election.
[01:21:59.324 --> 01:22:04.265]  And Russia said openly, from the mouth of Vladimir Putin, we're not interested in messing with their elections.
[01:22:04.745 --> 01:22:05.605]  That's not what we do.
[01:22:10.293 --> 01:22:12.193]  You can choose to believe that or you can choose not to.
[01:22:12.213 --> 01:22:16.414]  I mean, we could choose to be afraid of Russia for the rest of our lives.
[01:22:19.835 --> 01:22:25.957]  Or we could choose to start working together with these countries that we've considered our enemies.
[01:22:29.237 --> 01:22:39.660]  And start going after the people in this world who don't, who are men without countries, as they say, these globalists.
[01:22:41.414 --> 01:22:46.117]  Who kind of pit countries against each other and skate above the law.
[01:22:49.479 --> 01:22:51.720]  And while they make laws that we all have to follow.
[01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:55.722]  So I think that is where we need to go.
[01:22:55.802 --> 01:22:58.244]  We need to turn our attention towards the globalists.
[01:23:00.105 --> 01:23:03.827]  People like George Soros who is looking to make a commodity buy.
[01:23:04.147 --> 01:23:07.829]  So he decides he wants to screw with Ukraine.
[01:23:10.591 --> 01:23:10.671]  Or
[01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:12.951]  Make Hillary Clinton president.
[01:23:14.032 --> 01:23:14.652]  And he failed.
[01:23:17.435 --> 01:23:18.656]  Coming up, we're going to have a speech.
[01:23:18.696 --> 01:23:20.737]  Hillary's had to make her concession speech.
[01:23:20.958 --> 01:23:22.559]  You guys let me know when that pops in.
[01:23:22.599 --> 01:23:25.842]  Just bump me out.
[01:23:25.862 --> 01:23:31.866]  Let me go to InfoWars.com, see what's going on there, read some of the top headlines.
[01:23:32.827 --> 01:23:37.291]  Hillary supporters burn American flag, riot threatened to kill Trump after losing election.
[01:23:47.133 --> 01:23:51.034]  Van Jones, this election was a white lash in part.
[01:23:52.754 --> 01:23:58.075]  Pretty interesting interview with Van Jones, over 30 minutes long that we did at the RNC.
[01:23:58.095 --> 01:24:01.976]  He stopped and talked to Owen Schroer and a group of us for a while.
[01:24:01.996 --> 01:24:03.556]  It was a really good debate.
[01:24:05.737 --> 01:24:07.277]  And I remember something he said.
[01:24:07.397 --> 01:24:15.619]  He goes, you know, at the end of all this, when this is all done, we're still going to have to live with each other and we're going to have to figure out a way to make it work.
[01:24:18.578 --> 01:24:24.944]  That's going to be interesting to see if he's going to be willing to be part of that.
[01:24:24.964 --> 01:24:29.007]  There it is, Van Jones vs. Carl the Cuckslayer, Ultimate Street Debate.
[01:24:29.027 --> 01:24:30.008]  420,000 views.
[01:24:36.294 --> 01:24:44.361]  Van was so, I guess, blown away by the interview, his little bag, his NBC tote bag, he left on the ground and forgot it.
[01:24:45.285 --> 01:24:49.408]  And then came back to the restaurant we were eating in and asked us if we had taken it.
[01:24:49.728 --> 01:24:50.628]  Said, no, we didn't take it.
[01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:53.350]  Sure, somebody took it.
[01:24:56.872 --> 01:24:58.994]  So it'll be interesting to see what part he plays in this.
[01:24:59.374 --> 01:25:03.196]  You know, he was part of the Obama administration and left very early on.
[01:25:05.398 --> 01:25:08.600]  His parents, I think he talks about in this, his parents were police officers.
[01:25:11.351 --> 01:25:14.032]  You seem to be a big supporter of Black Lives Matter.
[01:25:14.652 --> 01:25:19.934]  Trump campaign manager does not rule out special prosecutor for Hillary Clinton, MSNBC.
[01:25:24.715 --> 01:25:25.836]  She needs to be investigated.
[01:25:27.256 --> 01:25:28.016]  All in due time.
[01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:30.737]  Yeah, I don't think this needs to be tomorrow.
[01:25:34.018 --> 01:25:35.619]  I think he needs to wait until he comes into power.
[01:25:41.105 --> 01:25:51.307]  And it just makes that statement he made when she said, oh, he would like to be in charge of everything.
[01:25:52.607 --> 01:25:54.608]  He goes, good thing he's not in charge of everything.
[01:25:54.628 --> 01:25:55.848]  He goes, yeah, you'd be in jail.
[01:25:57.568 --> 01:25:58.789]  She's not looking too good now.
[01:26:00.569 --> 01:26:06.450]  Donald Trump's campaign manager speaking on MSNBC said appointing a special prosecutor for Hillary Clinton can't be ruled out.
[01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:10.451]  Adding the discussion regarding the issue will happen in due time.
[01:26:14.947 --> 01:26:21.549]  And President Obama even called Donald Trump and offered his congratulations and they're going to talk about a little transition trip.
[01:26:23.890 --> 01:26:24.610]  So we'll see.
[01:26:24.810 --> 01:26:29.292]  You know, a lot of people said Trump's just a shill.
[01:26:29.712 --> 01:26:30.512]  Don't vote him in.
[01:26:33.753 --> 01:26:34.934]  Well, now we're going to see what happens.
[01:26:35.054 --> 01:26:39.435]  We're going to see if Trump is a shill or if he's a man of his word, if he's going to cut taxes.
[01:26:40.756 --> 01:26:43.777]  If he cuts corporate taxes to 15 percent,
[01:26:45.486 --> 01:26:49.970]  You're going to see a rash of corporations hiring people.
[01:26:52.952 --> 01:26:56.955]  And then those people are going to have money and they're going to go out and spend it and stimulate the economy.
[01:26:58.737 --> 01:27:01.279]  And they're going to be paying less taxes, so they're going to have more money.
[01:27:01.559 --> 01:27:03.440]  It's going to be a beautiful chain reaction.
[01:27:06.243 --> 01:27:11.427]  And people have extra money to give to charity and help their neighbor.
[01:27:15.706 --> 01:27:17.947]  And hopefully we can have the renaissance we deserve.
[01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:24.651]  But it's not going to happen without hard work.
[01:27:24.691 --> 01:27:28.554]  You cannot sit by and wait for a handout.
[01:27:29.054 --> 01:27:33.937]  You have to get up, pull yourself up by your bootstraps, and it's going to take hard work.
[01:27:36.959 --> 01:27:39.720]  That's the only thing that's going to change anything.
[01:27:40.821 --> 01:27:42.482]  In any stage of life you're in right now.
[01:27:44.793 --> 01:27:50.335]  If you don't get up and start making changes in your life, nothing will change.
[01:27:54.256 --> 01:28:07.480]  So we only have ourselves to blame if we don't succeed in this endeavor of becoming the place, and do it without going into socialism.
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:14.022]  You know, we become a country people want to come to, but we're not diving into socialism like
[01:28:16.431 --> 01:28:19.974]  Parts of Europe, or South America.
[01:28:22.395 --> 01:28:23.596]  Even Canada to some extent.
[01:28:23.616 --> 01:28:27.059]  There's a lot of people that love living in Canada right now.
[01:28:27.779 --> 01:28:30.221]  But they pay a lot of taxes to live there.
[01:28:32.523 --> 01:28:34.264]  But they got free healthcare, they say.
[01:28:34.724 --> 01:28:35.385]  It's not free.
[01:28:35.405 --> 01:28:36.485]  It's not free.
[01:28:37.026 --> 01:28:37.866]  You're paying for it.
[01:28:38.547 --> 01:28:39.227]  One way or another.
[01:28:42.330 --> 01:28:45.232]  By the way, I'm drinking some of our great InfoWars coffee.
[01:28:46.772 --> 01:28:48.653]  That we sell it in fourslife.com.
[01:28:49.914 --> 01:28:55.316]  And if you're a coffee drinker like I am, you can do yourself a service by getting a bag or two.
[01:28:55.496 --> 01:28:56.817]  It is some good stuff.
[01:28:57.637 --> 01:28:58.998]  And it tastes even better today.
[01:28:59.018 --> 01:29:03.300]  We got the Patriot Blend and the Immune Support Blend.
[01:29:03.841 --> 01:29:04.401]  And right now,
[01:29:06.052 --> 01:29:09.174]  We got free shipping store-wide, so I don't know what you're waiting for.
[01:29:09.654 --> 01:29:15.357]  Free shipping store-wide for our 52-hour live election broadcast super sale fundraiser.
[01:29:15.377 --> 01:29:23.621]  That's right, because we are funded by listeners and viewers like you out there who appreciate the information.
[01:29:23.641 --> 01:29:27.223]  Hey, think about it.
[01:29:27.903 --> 01:29:31.185]  What the hell are we going to talk about now that we don't have to talk about the election?
[01:29:36.203 --> 01:29:43.245]  We're going to talk about how to empower yourself and how to make your life better, among other things, and still look at the corruption that's out there.
[01:29:45.385 --> 01:29:47.545]  Like I said earlier, there's going to be a lot of work to do.
[01:29:50.186 --> 01:29:52.046]  Guys, has Hillary stepped up anywhere?
[01:29:52.086 --> 01:29:53.647]  Is she going to draw this out all day?
[01:29:54.767 --> 01:29:58.608]  They are waiting for her to arrive at the location of her speech.
[01:29:58.668 --> 01:30:02.049]  I'm not sure if it's at the Midtown Hotel or at the Janik Center in New York.
[01:30:03.269 --> 01:30:03.949]  Oh, Hillary.
[01:30:05.177 --> 01:30:07.059]  This is going to be the hardest speech of her life.
[01:30:07.079 --> 01:30:09.422]  Hopefully she doesn't cough and screw it up.
[01:30:09.702 --> 01:30:12.886]  She's going to make sure she doesn't do anything else that could further indict her.
[01:30:13.186 --> 01:30:13.466]  Yeah.
[01:30:13.787 --> 01:30:15.929]  Court of opinion or legal court.
[01:30:18.472 --> 01:30:20.935]  Yeah, what an amazing turn of events in the last week.
[01:30:22.236 --> 01:30:24.399]  Week and a half leading up to the election.
[01:30:27.549 --> 01:30:32.851]  You had the government and the media saying there's no election fraud, no election fraud.
[01:30:33.211 --> 01:30:39.793]  But wait, we have an underground bunker full of hackers ready to go after Russia because there's election fraud.
[01:30:42.514 --> 01:30:49.537]  And you had people saying there's no voter fraud.
[01:30:49.557 --> 01:30:52.198]  And then we go and
[01:30:54.389 --> 01:31:04.581]  Behind the lens of people like Project Veritas who have their people dress up as Muslims and go in and get ballots for people.
[01:31:07.444 --> 01:31:08.465]  They've done it before too.
[01:31:08.505 --> 01:31:09.366]  It's not the first time.
[01:31:11.328 --> 01:31:12.750]  Our system's got a lot of holes in it.
[01:31:16.277 --> 01:31:23.961]  I've got a feeling the word election fraud is going to roll off the tongue of Rachel Maddow very, very often in the following months.
[01:31:25.422 --> 01:31:26.923]  Yeah, they're going to say Trump stole it.
[01:31:28.904 --> 01:31:32.325]  Even though he doesn't have that big Democratic base behind him.
[01:31:33.986 --> 01:31:37.348]  They're not going to say anything about Hillary getting the questions early in the debates.
[01:31:38.389 --> 01:31:42.711]  Or the DNC working with CNN to come up with questions for Trump.
[01:31:42.731 --> 01:31:44.552]  They're not going to hear about that.
[01:31:46.112 --> 01:31:47.593]  No, it's gonna be Donald Trump stole it.
[01:31:47.613 --> 01:31:48.774]  He's a big, meany racist.
[01:31:49.755 --> 01:32:00.565]  And our country's going to hell now that some man is... who is a, you know, a self-made businessman, now that he's in charge.
[01:32:02.326 --> 01:32:03.007]  Can't have that.
[01:32:04.408 --> 01:32:04.588]  Nope.
[01:32:10.854 --> 01:32:12.075]  Lot of headlines on Trump.
[01:32:13.356 --> 01:32:17.758]  Here's one of the new statesmen, the little mushroom cloud, the Trump apocalypse.
[01:32:20.219 --> 01:32:21.220]  I saw that with Hillary.
[01:32:22.401 --> 01:32:23.841]  A lot of people saw that with Hillary.
[01:32:23.941 --> 01:32:25.682]  Jill Stein even saw it with Hillary.
[01:32:30.685 --> 01:32:39.809]  Bernstein last night, one of the famous duo Woodward and Bernstein, said Drudge was in an alternative universe.
[01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:42.791]  There was Drudge plugging away.
[01:32:44.335 --> 01:32:45.075]  Not speaking.
[01:32:45.956 --> 01:32:48.097]  Letting his headlines do the talking.
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:55.222]  Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated a true friend of Israel.
[01:32:58.464 --> 01:33:03.207]  Egypt's Sisi is the first international call.
[01:33:05.097 --> 01:33:09.339]  Hungarian PM Orban hails victory as great news.
[01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:12.801]  Philippines Duarte congratulates, wants to work together.
[01:33:13.582 --> 01:33:14.082]  Le Pen.
[01:33:14.762 --> 01:33:15.143]  Putin.
[01:33:17.404 --> 01:33:19.705]  There's a lot of countries that seem to be thinking this is a good thing.
[01:33:21.066 --> 01:33:28.170]  That we're afraid of Hillary Clinton and what she would have done with the power she so desperately craved.
[01:33:30.932 --> 01:33:32.933]  She was so desperate for this power, she
[01:33:34.349 --> 01:33:40.491]  And her team would continuously bend and cheat to try and get her in the presidency.
[01:33:43.912 --> 01:33:51.794]  They would take the nomination from Bernie Sanders and have the gall to stand up and say, it's her time.
[01:33:52.974 --> 01:33:53.675]  She's a woman.
[01:33:55.155 --> 01:34:01.537]  And now we're about to hear her concession speech as we, as the clock ticks into the
[01:34:03.843 --> 01:34:05.363]  First Trump administration.
[01:34:08.004 --> 01:34:18.727]  But for the next four years, I think if he thought he's going to be pulling arrows out of his back, or if he thought he had to turn this this election, it's going to be relentless.
[01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:25.989]  And, you know, the media knows, wow, we've got a guy that people are interested in hearing about Trump.
[01:34:27.429 --> 01:34:28.430]  We're going to talk about everything.
[01:34:28.770 --> 01:34:29.530]  We're going to become Trump
[01:34:31.223 --> 01:34:31.824]  Trump News.
[01:34:32.264 --> 01:34:33.365]  Trump doesn't need a network.
[01:34:33.825 --> 01:34:36.948]  He's got four networks that are dying right now.
[01:34:36.968 --> 01:34:47.957]  And I think there's a great video out there where Wolf Blitzer's interviewing him and he goes, why do you attack Megyn Kelly?
[01:34:49.198 --> 01:34:57.664]  And he goes, because she attacks me night after night, day after day, and if she didn't talk about me, her ratings would be even lower than yours.
[01:34:59.980 --> 01:35:01.041]  And that's the truth.
[01:35:01.161 --> 01:35:02.402]  The mainstream media is dying.
[01:35:02.422 --> 01:35:09.367]  And their only hope is going to be to report relentlessly on Trump.
[01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:14.591]  So it's a good day today.
[01:35:14.611 --> 01:35:16.492]  I'm sorry if I seem a little down.
[01:35:17.853 --> 01:35:18.834]  Major lack of sleep.
[01:35:18.914 --> 01:35:24.639]  I've probably had four hours of sleep in the last two days.
[01:35:26.013 --> 01:35:27.094]  I'm running on fumes.
[01:35:27.314 --> 01:35:28.754]  It's 936 a.m.
[01:35:28.935 --> 01:35:37.179]  and you are watching the 52-hour live election broadcast at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:35:37.199 --> 01:35:38.239]  It's our free stream.
[01:35:38.259 --> 01:35:43.462]  We're also streaming on Facebook and on YouTube.
[01:35:45.643 --> 01:35:51.006]  Several YouTube streams, several Facebook streams, and we're gonna go till 3 o'clock today.
[01:35:53.692 --> 01:36:01.875]  And I think we will have satisfied our insatiable need to be on TV and spread the news after 52 hours.
[01:36:01.895 --> 01:36:06.557]  You think you guys out there in the control room, you think we'll have done it after 52 hours?
[01:36:08.698 --> 01:36:11.339]  We will have fulfilled the need.
[01:36:11.379 --> 01:36:14.360]  Fulfilled the need, yes, for sleep deprivation.
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:16.901]  It's our patriotic duty.
[01:36:18.368 --> 01:36:19.568]  So I want to go to this video.
[01:36:19.588 --> 01:36:25.690]  I was hoping we could go to Clinton and she would come out and speak for seven minutes because she can't really go on much longer than that.
[01:36:26.370 --> 01:36:34.691]  And then go to this video report that Dr. Group came in and filed yesterday talking about the new flu shot that they're pushing on old people.
[01:36:38.272 --> 01:36:44.353]  Because if you get rid of old people, you can hire more teachers, says Bill Gates.
[01:36:45.814 --> 01:36:47.394]  If you help them with their end-of-life treatment.
[01:36:49.835 --> 01:36:54.879]  And one way to do that is inject them with toxic ingredients that compromise their immune system.
[01:36:56.681 --> 01:36:59.543]  We had a caller earlier, Grace, who's a nurse.
[01:37:02.485 --> 01:37:04.787]  She's seen a bunch of adverse reactions from shots.
[01:37:06.388 --> 01:37:07.649]  She doesn't take the flu shot.
[01:37:09.271 --> 01:37:10.492]  She goes, I just wear the mask.
[01:37:14.795 --> 01:37:16.176]  I don't know, who do you think knows more?
[01:37:16.697 --> 01:37:18.338]  A nurse or a politician?
[01:37:19.676 --> 01:37:21.916]  Well, about health, I think a nurse knows more.
[01:37:21.936 --> 01:37:25.517]  About stealing from you, I think a politician knows more.
[01:37:27.797 --> 01:37:41.100]  But when I talk to nurses about vaccines, they always talk about the side effects that they see, because they're on the front lines.
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:48.261]  In fact, we had a nurse in one time, I think David Knight interviewed her, and she talked about how
[01:37:49.417 --> 01:37:59.506]  They would give preemies their Hep B shot because, you know, premature babies having anal sex and shooting up with dirty needles.
[01:38:00.467 --> 01:38:03.009]  You know, it's a rash going on right now.
[01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:06.632]  Rash of premature babies doing that.
[01:38:06.672 --> 01:38:11.456]  So they give them that Hep B vaccine and they have the incubators ready because they stop breathing.
[01:38:13.318 --> 01:38:14.099]  And the ventilators.
[01:38:15.188 --> 01:38:17.270]  The intubators, I'm sorry, not incubators.
[01:38:17.290 --> 01:38:18.411]  They keep them in incubators.
[01:38:18.771 --> 01:38:20.633]  But they're intubators and they help them breathe.
[01:38:21.313 --> 01:38:24.836]  And they have them ready because, oh, the poor little baby stopped breathing.
[01:38:24.996 --> 01:38:26.317]  Better get them ready in the NICU.
[01:38:26.337 --> 01:38:39.168]  I tell you, one group of women and men that do love to push vaccines are those neonatal nurses.
[01:38:39.368 --> 01:38:40.129]  They are told
[01:38:41.181 --> 01:38:42.442]  And they full court pressed it.
[01:38:42.502 --> 01:38:45.563]  They full court pressed us in the hospital last time.
[01:38:45.583 --> 01:38:47.904]  Gave them that hep B shot.
[01:38:47.924 --> 01:38:50.064]  That vitamin K shot.
[01:38:51.365 --> 01:38:55.066]  Even though you can give them an oral dose of vitamin K, which doesn't have a bunch of ingredients in it.
[01:38:56.567 --> 01:38:58.027]  Still gives them the vitamin K they need.
[01:38:58.367 --> 01:39:01.949]  Oh no, but we've done studies and the oral vitamin K just doesn't absorb.
[01:39:03.890 --> 01:39:06.631]  And right after they told me that, I went and looked up and found 14 studies
[01:39:08.755 --> 01:39:12.797]  Including one that looked at over 100,000 people over a 30-year period.
[01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:20.142]  And it showed, yeah, it does pretty much the same.
[01:39:20.802 --> 01:39:21.303]  Absorption.
[01:39:22.323 --> 01:39:24.445]  By taking it orally, then injecting it.
[01:39:26.206 --> 01:39:27.146]  Not much of a difference.
[01:39:30.288 --> 01:39:31.689]  And I would ask them about those studies.
[01:39:31.709 --> 01:39:33.270]  Oh, we've done new studies.
[01:39:34.090 --> 01:39:36.312]  Always have something new to say.
[01:39:37.170 --> 01:39:39.312]  And they're like, you know, it's so sad.
[01:39:39.352 --> 01:39:41.193]  There's a rash of information out there.
[01:39:43.615 --> 01:39:45.456]  And I know it can be hard being a parent.
[01:39:47.378 --> 01:39:53.642]  But trust me, because I get a bonus from Big Pharma if I get you to take this shot.
[01:39:56.064 --> 01:40:00.247]  So, well, I guess we're not going to wait for Hillary Clinton any longer.
[01:40:00.267 --> 01:40:05.071]  We're going to give you some flu information, some flu shot information, because flu season is upon us.
[01:40:06.161 --> 01:40:12.803]  And don't forget, you're watching the 52-hour live election broadcast, and we have a super sale going on at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.942]  Silver Bullet was on special earlier.
[01:40:37.662 --> 01:40:38.783]  I think it's still on special.
[01:40:39.464 --> 01:40:40.885]  So go check out the store right now.
[01:40:43.267 --> 01:40:46.269]  And this report will be filed on YouTube.
[01:40:47.170 --> 01:40:53.715]  This flu shot report from Dr. Group going over the new flu shot that's mainly being offered to old people.
[01:40:55.756 --> 01:41:00.640]  And he's seen people coming into his practice with debilitating side effects.
[01:41:01.381 --> 01:41:02.562]  So he's just trying to warn people.
[01:41:07.461 --> 01:41:09.582]  So, I think Paul Watson will be back.
[01:41:09.642 --> 01:41:10.802]  If not, I'll be back here.
[01:41:11.622 --> 01:41:14.863]  I'll wait it out, see if he shows up from across the pond.
[01:41:14.883 --> 01:41:19.484]  I'm sure Watson's gonna have a great perspective on what's going on.
[01:41:19.524 --> 01:41:20.424]  He's already been tweeting.
[01:41:22.605 --> 01:41:26.465]  By the way, my Twitter is at DewsNews, D-E-W-S-N-E-W-Z.
[01:41:26.886 --> 01:41:28.866]  I didn't even tweet much after Trump won.
[01:41:28.906 --> 01:41:32.627]  I was too busy shooting videos of what's going on, shooting Facebook videos.
[01:41:34.781 --> 01:41:38.024]  So we really showed last night what we could do as the people's media.
[01:41:39.225 --> 01:41:43.729]  We appreciate you joining us on that journey here at InfoWars.com, and we want to do more.
[01:41:45.530 --> 01:41:46.411]  So please support us.
[01:41:46.951 --> 01:41:49.714]  Try out our new app, InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:41:50.094 --> 01:41:52.156]  We got a free version and a subscription version.
[01:41:52.816 --> 01:42:01.844]  And the subscription version is only going to grow, so maybe you could help grow with us in that journey to report the news because
[01:42:03.561 --> 01:42:05.642]  We've let the mainstream media do it for too long.
[01:42:05.663 --> 01:42:12.948]  And they are no longer worthy of our tears and our hard work.
[01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:19.492]  It's time to put out what's really going on in the world.
[01:42:19.512 --> 01:42:23.515]  And we can no longer stand idly by.
[01:42:23.615 --> 01:42:24.236]  So join us.

[01:42:52.985 --> 01:42:54.126]  So close I can taste it!
[01:42:56.291 --> 01:42:57.592]  I'm going to go take a nap, hopefully.
[01:42:58.393 --> 01:43:00.234]  And you enjoy this message from Dr. Group.

[01:43:09.041 --> 01:43:10.042]  Let's go ahead and roll that video.
[01:43:14.893 --> 01:43:32.264]  Hi everyone, I'm Dr. Group and today I'd like to present a special report during these election times and as you know I'm the health consultant or one of the health consultants for InfoWars and today I'd like to bring attention to this year's flu shot
[01:43:33.284 --> 01:43:45.927]  What's been going on currently in the government and how you can naturally boost your immune system and help yourself during the 2016 and 2017 flu season.
[01:43:46.647 --> 01:43:53.769]  First of all, I'd like to bring your attention to a document, an executive order that was signed on November 4th, 2016 by President Obama.
[01:43:58.171 --> 01:44:11.331]  With all of the election coverage that's been going on, this is really a shocking document that I was able to bring up due to the fact that I've had so many calls lately.
[01:44:12.913 --> 01:44:34.222]  uh... from people all over the united states and i always know when something is happening or something's going on by the amount of phone calls that we get and this year was different years people complaining of muscle weakness and headaches and all of these symptoms and we tracked it down to this year's flu shot or at least that's one of the culprits that we think might be happening so
[01:44:35.302 --> 01:44:43.009]  As a research scientist, I wanted to bring as much information together as I could and try to discover what in the world is going on out there this year.
[01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:52.818]  My job, InfoWars' job, is to try to protect you against everything, and education and knowledge is the best protection that you can have.
[01:44:52.918 --> 01:44:55.360]  So this special report today, I want to break down what
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:59.823]  It's currently happening in the 2016-2017 flu season.
[01:44:59.863 --> 01:45:07.069]  I also want to give you guys some tips on how you can prevent or avoid the flu shot this year.
[01:45:08.249 --> 01:45:11.932]  Like I said, it starts with this executive order from President Obama.
[01:45:11.952 --> 01:45:22.160]  The executive order is advancing the global health security agenda to achieve a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats.
[01:45:23.092 --> 01:45:24.533]  Now, this is a long document.
[01:45:24.593 --> 01:45:32.496]  I highly recommend you go to the whitehouse.gov website if you want to print it out or if you want to read the full document.
[01:45:32.576 --> 01:45:37.538]  But I'll just generalize and summarize what the document is about.
[01:45:38.218 --> 01:45:47.582]  Section 1 says, Promoting global health security is a core tenet of our national strategy for countering biological threats.
[01:45:52.461 --> 01:46:02.087]  Now, as you know, a biological threat can be anything spread throughout the world that is going to cause sickness and possibly death.
[01:46:03.568 --> 01:46:21.318]  Therefore, it is the policy of the United States to advance the Global Health Security Agenda, which is a multifaceted, multi-country initiative intended to accelerate partner countries, achieve specific targets to prevent, detect and respond to infectious disease threats.
[01:46:21.918 --> 01:46:30.401]  Most people don't know, but a lot of these flu vaccines that have been developed over the last couple years are actually quadrivalent, trivalent.
[01:46:30.961 --> 01:46:38.404]  And let me just say, it is impossible, ladies and gentlemen, to create a flu vaccine that actually works.
[01:46:39.084 --> 01:46:41.945]  And this is not just me telling you this.
[01:46:42.085 --> 01:46:47.187]  I mean, all you have to do is type in how a flu vaccine is made, and I'm going to go over some of this with you today.
[01:46:47.947 --> 01:46:50.488]  But the influenza virus
[01:46:51.602 --> 01:46:56.626]  Actually changes its DNA structure every time it replicates.
[01:46:56.926 --> 01:47:02.129]  So it's literally and scientifically impossible to develop an influenza vaccine.
[01:47:02.169 --> 01:47:04.751]  That's why they have to pick and choose viruses.
[01:47:05.472 --> 01:47:10.915]  And people that get the flu vaccine can shed these viral particles from their skin.
[01:47:10.955 --> 01:47:14.538]  They float around in the air for up to 17 days.
[01:47:14.798 --> 01:47:17.160]  So even if your neighbor or somebody that you're
[01:47:18.044 --> 01:47:25.774]  You know, close to where your kids go to school, you still have the threat of possibly inhaling or getting these viral fragments.
[01:47:26.355 --> 01:47:30.861]  And why this executive order, I'm still trying to figure out why that was done in secret.
[01:47:31.401 --> 01:47:31.882]  I don't know.
[01:47:32.262 --> 01:47:32.683]  November 4th.
[01:47:33.624 --> 01:47:55.540]  But it clearly states that all of the organizations are going to be coming together, the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, the Department of State, to try to initiate some sort of bioterrorism agenda.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:58.101]  So that led me to
[01:47:59.719 --> 01:48:14.609]  The next document, after I read through the executive order, I decided to go to the CDC website and see what in the world, because anytime I hear biological or anything like that, the first thing I want to do is I want to see what are they trying to promote this year?
[01:48:14.889 --> 01:48:15.650]  What is different?
[01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:16.550]  What's going on?
[01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:20.093]  There's always some sort of a hidden agenda going on and I wanted to expose it.
[01:48:21.414 --> 01:48:25.576]  Sure enough, on the first page of the CDC under flu, we have what
[01:48:28.251 --> 01:48:32.393]  ...is new for the 2016-2017 flu season.
[01:48:33.994 --> 01:48:41.819]  Now, it says, third bullet point down, there will be some new vaccines on the market this season.
[01:48:43.704 --> 01:48:45.585]  What flu vaccines are recommended?
[01:48:45.985 --> 01:48:51.408]  This season, only injectable flu vaccines should be used.
[01:48:51.528 --> 01:49:04.214]  Now, in the past, there were vaccines that were the mist vaccines that people were spraying in their nose and inhaling, but this year, which is very strange, only injectable flu vaccines are recommended.
[01:49:05.134 --> 01:49:09.216]  Now, the options this season include standard dose flu shots,
[01:49:10.498 --> 01:49:20.501]  This is what really sticked out to me because of the fact that I've been having people call my office and their parents, their grandparents are becoming severely ill.
[01:49:21.822 --> 01:49:25.943]  A high dose shot for older people.
[01:49:27.584 --> 01:49:30.905]  A shot made with adjuvant for older people.
[01:49:30.965 --> 01:49:33.426]  And I'm going to explain to you what that adjuvant is.
[01:49:34.286 --> 01:49:37.287]  And a shot made with virus grown in cell culture.
[01:49:38.208 --> 01:49:47.770]  Now, if you look further down on the document, you actually see a sentence there that says, what flu vaccines are new this season?
[01:49:48.965 --> 01:49:53.529]  This season, a flu vaccine with adjuvant will be available for the first time in the United States.
[01:49:53.989 --> 01:50:00.794]  Adjuvant is a vaccine ingredient that helps create a stronger immune response in the patient's body.
[01:50:01.635 --> 01:50:07.039]  This new vaccine, Fluad, is approved for use in 65 and older.
[01:50:07.659 --> 01:50:11.782]  The next new vaccine is a vaccine called
[01:50:12.643 --> 01:50:18.565]  Flucelvax, and that is the one for children recommended for years and older.
[01:50:19.205 --> 01:50:27.447]  So what's going on with these new vaccines that they're putting on the market this year and asking people to get?
[01:50:28.287 --> 01:50:37.750]  Well, I did some research and as it turns out, Fluad and Flucelvax is actually manufactured by the same company.
[01:50:38.590 --> 01:50:40.131]  A company called Seqirus.
[01:50:40.851 --> 01:50:51.215]  Now, if you look at this document right here, Fluad, Flucelvax, you know, they specialize in vaccine production.
[01:50:52.215 --> 01:50:59.117]  But, if you dig even deeper, they also specialize in biological development as well.
[01:51:02.168 --> 01:51:09.695]  If you look at Securus, who owns Securus, is the next thing I said, trying to figure out if there's any connection.
[01:51:10.375 --> 01:51:15.200]  I did find that Securus is owned by a company called CSL Limited.
[01:51:16.481 --> 01:51:27.271]  And, just goes to show you that the director of CSL Limited is a guy named Dr. Tadatkaka Yamada.
[01:51:29.046 --> 01:51:42.009]  And his past job included President of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Health Program, and Chairman of Research and Development at GlaxoSmithKline.
[01:51:42.689 --> 01:51:55.832]  He also currently serves as a Director of Agilent Technologies, Inc., and the Clinton Health Access Initiative, and a member of the Council of the National Academy of Medicine.
[01:51:57.213 --> 01:51:58.174]  What does that mean?
[01:51:58.954 --> 01:52:03.336]  Obviously, we've had a depopulation agenda going on for quite some time.
[01:52:03.376 --> 01:52:11.841]  We've had Bill... I mean, openly, the globalists have openly admitted that we need to institute a depopulation scheme.
[01:52:12.421 --> 01:52:17.144]  We know that the Obamacare system and the current healthcare system is a disaster.
[01:52:19.245 --> 01:52:21.466]  Who are the easiest people to get rid of?
[01:52:22.748 --> 01:52:25.529]  What is the most cost for our government?
[01:52:25.909 --> 01:52:28.490]  Of course, it's the 65 plus age group.
[01:52:29.530 --> 01:52:35.272]  So all of a sudden now they're coming out with a vaccine for the 65 and older age group?
[01:52:35.832 --> 01:52:40.093]  Let's take a look at that vaccine and let me show you what we have to look forward to this year.
[01:52:41.974 --> 01:52:42.574]  Fluad.
[01:52:42.954 --> 01:52:47.275]  Fluad is the one that they're recommending for individuals 65 and older.
[01:52:48.376 --> 01:52:49.316]  As you can see here,
[01:52:51.997 --> 01:52:54.358]  It has multiple influenza strains.
[01:52:55.498 --> 01:52:59.839]  Influenza strains and MF59C.
[01:53:00.199 --> 01:53:00.579]  Okay?
[01:53:01.119 --> 01:53:06.620]  This is a key ingredient that I need to talk about for a minute.
[01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:10.641]  Breaking down, by the way, these are confidential documents that I was able to get.
[01:53:11.001 --> 01:53:17.302]  You can actually see at the top of the document itself where it says confidential up there.
[01:53:20.071 --> 01:53:21.131]  MF59C.
[01:53:21.912 --> 01:53:22.632]  What is that?
[01:53:24.033 --> 01:53:43.821]  MF59C, if you look it up, is a highly toxic vaccine adjuvant called squalene MF59, which was first given to servicemen back during the first Gulf War and linked to Gulf War syndrome.
[01:53:45.492 --> 01:53:56.545]  The experimental oil and water adjuvant was forced on all servicemen beginning in 1999 via the mandatory anthrax vaccine.
[01:53:58.727 --> 01:54:03.492]  Captain Rovitz's comrades suffered severe and permanent side effects.
[01:54:04.946 --> 01:54:20.841]  For the past 64 years, the United States military and other agencies within our government have used our servicemen and women, this is a quote by the way, as test subjects, oftentimes in secret and without informed consent, explained Captain Rovet.
[01:54:21.361 --> 01:54:22.482]  I was in the military.
[01:54:23.643 --> 01:54:32.028]  And there was a couple times where they brought us all in and gave us vaccinations and would not tell us what they were or what they were supposed to do.
[01:54:32.769 --> 01:54:36.831]  So who knows if I'm going to be affected 10 years later from that.
[01:54:37.731 --> 01:54:38.592]  But listen to this.
[01:54:40.173 --> 01:54:50.219]  Roughly one out of four, one out of four servicemen and women veterans, brothers and sisters who served
[01:54:51.135 --> 01:54:58.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am not the type of person to try to instill fear, doom and gloom, but I am here warning everybody.
[01:55:11.786 --> 01:55:34.867]  That this may be the most devastating flu season in the history of the world, because I've never seen such a possibly, potentially, well I'm not even going to say possibly, damaging slew of ingredients that are going to be injected into our moms, our dads, our grandparents,
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:44.286]  And we are on the verge of seeing a massive shift in disease and sickness and possibly even death.
[01:55:44.706 --> 01:55:48.909]  Let me read to you what is in that Fluad vaccine.
[01:55:50.490 --> 01:55:58.096]  First, it has the MF59, which is the squalene-based, Gulf War Syndrome-based adjuvant.
[01:55:59.389 --> 01:56:02.231]  It has polysorbate 80, which is a toxic ingredient.
[01:56:02.371 --> 01:56:04.992]  It has sorbitan tri-oleate.
[01:56:05.432 --> 01:56:10.935]  It has sodium citrate dihydrate and citric acid monohydrate.
[01:56:12.036 --> 01:56:25.123]  It even contains trace amounts of neomycin, kanamycin, and barium, which are used during the initial stages of manufacture as well as residual egg proteins.
[01:56:26.852 --> 01:56:26.912]  I'm
[01:56:44.730 --> 01:56:50.873]  Deficient in iodine because of the other halogens which are going to be the bromide, chloride and fluorine.
[01:56:51.353 --> 01:56:54.015]  So that is something that we definitely need to watch out for.
[01:56:54.875 --> 01:57:01.499]  Please, if you have children, if you have grandparents,
[01:57:03.078 --> 01:57:06.580]  Hopefully you guys do, and hopefully you have parents as well.
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:09.181]  Please do your research.
[01:57:09.622 --> 01:57:12.303]  Please do your research on this year's vaccines.
[01:57:13.224 --> 01:57:27.571]  The toxicity of the sedal trimethylammonium bromide animal testings has shown ingestion of less than 150 grams of the agent can lead to adverse health effects or possibly death.
[01:57:29.713 --> 01:57:29.913]  So,
[01:57:31.567 --> 01:57:40.059]  The next vaccine that's available for children this year is called Flucelvax, and that's a subunit influenza vaccine.
[01:57:41.371 --> 01:58:02.727]  This actually contains a Brisbane wild-type H1N1-like virus, a South Australian wild-type virus, a Switzerland wild-type virus, a Utah B. fucut-like virus, and it contains residual amounts of MDCK cell protein.
[01:58:02.827 --> 01:58:06.429]  That's a Madden-Darby canine kidney cells.
[01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:13.034]  So they're culturing these vaccines and these viral particles on dog kidney cells.
[01:58:15.796 --> 01:58:33.709]  I know vaccines and flu vaccines is a very controversial issue and it's something that I hope that today I was able to provide you with enough information to make a decision, a good decision for yourself and your family this year.
[01:58:33.849 --> 01:58:34.870]  I've never seen
[01:58:36.567 --> 01:58:41.350]  In 20 years, flu vaccines that look this damaging.
[01:58:42.251 --> 01:58:46.074]  So let me tell you about some of the things that I do now.
[01:58:47.475 --> 01:58:51.638]  First of all, since the influenza virus, like I said, it replicates every time.
[01:58:51.678 --> 01:58:54.960]  There's no possible way you're ever going to have one vaccine.
[01:58:55.020 --> 01:59:04.347]  So let's talk about the natural methods that I use to support my body's immune system to keep me safe and my children from the flu.
[01:59:05.731 --> 01:59:08.194]  First thing you want to do is probiotics.
[01:59:08.574 --> 01:59:21.029]  A good probiotic, and what I do is I take probiotics every single day, especially maybe double during the flu season or every other day, because probiotics and your gut health is your immune system.
[01:59:21.710 --> 01:59:25.071]  The thing is, God gave us an immune system and a self-healing mechanism.
[01:59:25.111 --> 01:59:28.253]  We don't need to look outside for vaccines and everything else.
[01:59:28.293 --> 01:59:29.633]  We have the power within us.
[01:59:29.673 --> 01:59:34.315]  We have everything that we need to heal ourselves right inside of us.
[01:59:34.375 --> 01:59:38.777]  We just need to activate our immune system and keep it strong.
[01:59:39.178 --> 01:59:41.979]  And this year especially, we're under attack.
[01:59:42.921 --> 01:59:45.244]  So, stock up on probiotics.
[01:59:45.304 --> 01:59:46.305]  Take probiotics.
[01:59:46.345 --> 01:59:47.266]  Give them to your family.
[01:59:47.306 --> 01:59:49.088]  That's also going to help.
[01:59:49.428 --> 01:59:50.509]  Talk to your doctor first.
[01:59:50.569 --> 01:59:53.552]  I don't want anybody thinking I'm giving medical advice here.
[01:59:54.073 --> 02:00:00.980]  Make sure you clarify this with your natural health care practitioner or just your regular general practitioner as well.
[02:00:02.180 --> 02:00:05.562]  Vitamin C works extremely well to take during the holidays.
[02:00:05.582 --> 02:00:08.885]  This is kind of my holiday immune system tips.
[02:00:09.645 --> 02:00:23.014]  Another thing that I do is I take the winter sun which is a vitamin D. A lot of people's immune system goes down in the winter because they're not getting enough sun obviously and vitamin D is a vital part of
[02:00:24.235 --> 02:00:24.875]  Thank you for watching!
[02:00:42.947 --> 02:00:43.348]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:00:58.444 --> 02:01:00.645]  Prevent or keep your immune system strong.
[02:01:00.685 --> 02:01:08.329]  See, naturally we have cells in our body that will attack these strange viruses and these strange bacteria and everything that come into our system.
[02:01:08.749 --> 02:01:26.559]  We just need to provide our army with the best nutrients and everything else that we need in order for our army to be able to attack and be able to fight off all of these man-made, most of them are man-made, components and viruses and everything else.
[02:01:28.281 --> 02:01:32.167]  One of my other favorite things that I like to take is oregano oil.
[02:01:32.227 --> 02:01:35.232]  Oregano oil is definitely on my top five list.
[02:01:35.753 --> 02:01:37.916]  So is silver, colloidal silver.
[02:01:38.377 --> 02:01:42.063]  All of these things I've seen have worked extremely well.
[02:01:43.678 --> 02:01:46.119]  Another thing, get some sleep.
[02:01:46.579 --> 02:01:49.300]  Sleep is extremely important for your immune system.
[02:01:49.380 --> 02:01:54.661]  Try to get eight hours of sleep a night, and also try to reduce your stress levels.
[02:01:54.721 --> 02:01:59.763]  It's really hard for your immune system to work if your stress levels are really, really high.
[02:02:00.223 --> 02:02:11.446]  I know it's easier said than done, but take some time for yourself, calm yourself down, do some deep breathing exercises, and just try to relieve the stress from your body.
[02:02:12.026 --> 02:02:15.389]  That will help you out tremendously and keep your immune system strong.
[02:02:15.709 --> 02:02:19.251]  So take care of yourself and your loved ones over the holiday season.
[02:02:19.912 --> 02:02:24.956]  Make sure you make the right decision as far as whether or not you're gonna get a flu shot this year.
[02:02:25.716 --> 02:02:28.178]  And go to InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:02:33.602 --> 02:02:36.004]  I'm Dr. Group for InfoWars.com.
[02:02:44.460 --> 02:02:50.621]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:02:51.001 --> 02:02:53.882]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:02:54.222 --> 02:02:59.423]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:02:59.843 --> 02:03:05.824]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:03:05.944 --> 02:03:09.085]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:03:09.225 --> 02:03:10.685]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:03:10.905 --> 02:03:15.029]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:03:15.229 --> 02:03:18.091]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:03:18.171 --> 02:03:19.753]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:03:19.853 --> 02:03:23.016]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:03:23.316 --> 02:03:25.638]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:03:25.918 --> 02:03:26.879]  It's in powder form.
[02:03:26.979 --> 02:03:29.681]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:03:29.862 --> 02:03:30.862]  I take this.
[02:03:30.983 --> 02:03:32.264]  This is the product that I take.
[02:03:32.384 --> 02:03:34.346]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[02:03:35.166 --> 02:03:35.927]  We fight the Globals.
[02:03:35.967 --> 02:03:36.807]  We fight the New World Order.

[02:03:54.787 --> 02:03:56.388]  And we are back live.
[02:03:56.408 --> 02:04:01.610]  It is the morning after the night before, and of course, historic night it was.
[02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:11.215]  Donald J. Trump took on the political class, the media, Hollywood, Wall Street, rigged polls, and he completely eviscerated all of them.
[02:04:11.755 --> 02:04:16.277]  Hillary Clinton, any moment now, is set to give her concession speech.
[02:04:16.317 --> 02:04:20.519]  Of course, we had that bizarre incident last night where they sent out John Podesta.
[02:04:21.624 --> 02:04:34.332]  He took a break from his spirit cooking to make an appearance live on stage in front of all those weeping, butthurt Hillary supporters and made this bizarre comment about, you know, we're going to see what happens, we'll have more tomorrow.
[02:04:34.792 --> 02:04:38.615]  Of course, then reportedly Hillary Clinton made that call to Donald Trump.
[02:04:38.655 --> 02:04:45.038]  He came out on stage and only then, wasn't it interesting that only after Hillary made that call
[02:04:45.999 --> 02:04:56.710]  Did Fox News, did CNN, did all these other media outlets actually have the gall, actually have the guts to officially declare Donald Trump the President?
[02:04:57.290 --> 02:05:03.736]  Despite the fact that in states like Pennsylvania, states like Michigan, states like Wisconsin,
[02:05:04.497 --> 02:05:07.420]  The vote was 96, 97, 98, 99% in.
[02:05:07.580 --> 02:05:14.827]  He'd clearly won those states, and yet they still refused to declare him president.
[02:05:15.127 --> 02:05:19.291]  In fact, I don't even know if Fox News ever declared him winner of Pennsylvania at all.
[02:05:19.992 --> 02:05:25.776]  They waited until Hillary Clinton gave them the green light to declare Donald Trump the presidency.
[02:05:26.276 --> 02:05:27.597]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:05:28.137 --> 02:05:30.739]  Another example of the rigged media which we're going to get into.
[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:39.705]  But again, Alex Jones is coming up in just under an hour for the first official post-election broadcast, so be sure to stay here for that.
[02:05:40.526 --> 02:05:42.687]  Top story up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:05:42.707 --> 02:05:43.728]  Let's delve right into this.
[02:05:44.828 --> 02:05:46.490]  Again, we had this narrative for weeks.
[02:05:47.358 --> 02:05:52.222]  If not for months, that Donald Trump supporters are violent, unwieldy, intolerant.
[02:05:52.583 --> 02:05:58.468]  They're going to stage riots, they're going to stage civil unrest and violence if Donald Trump loses the election.
[02:05:59.809 --> 02:06:01.470]  Well, lo and behold, what's happened?
[02:06:01.570 --> 02:06:11.379]  Well, Hillary Clinton has lost the election and Hillary Clinton supporters are staging civil unrest and violence, thankfully in small doses so far.
[02:06:11.779 --> 02:06:14.661]  But again, this could escalate tonight and over the next few days.
[02:06:15.442 --> 02:06:17.104]  Rioting hit the streets of Portland.
[02:06:17.144 --> 02:06:18.885]  This is the headline up on Infowars.com.
[02:06:19.466 --> 02:06:26.232]  Hillary supporters burn American flag, riot, threaten to kill Trump after losing the election because they're tolerant liberals.
[02:06:26.713 --> 02:06:37.723]  Rioting hit the streets of Portland and Oakland as Hillary Clinton supporters reacted badly to Donald Trump's election victory, while death threats against the new president-elect flooded social media.
[02:06:38.789 --> 02:06:43.114]  Again, you see these reports out of RT, out of Local Fox 5 there on the scene.
[02:06:43.735 --> 02:06:49.461]  Windows were broken, cars were set on fire in Oakland as outright protesters lit flares and blocked freeways.
[02:06:50.402 --> 02:06:53.246]  Protester was struck by a vehicle, people were injured.
[02:06:54.048 --> 02:07:01.530]  Videos also show students on the streets of Eugene and Portland protesting again against a democratic election.
[02:07:02.250 --> 02:07:06.631]  Of course, the very notion of a demonstration is against something that negatively impacts you.
[02:07:06.692 --> 02:07:11.453]  This was a democratic election, a free election, which you lost!
[02:07:12.321 --> 02:07:23.331]  And now they're out on the streets of Eugene and Portland chanting BITCH and F Trump as they march in unison because that's gonna fix their butthurt, apparently.
[02:07:24.091 --> 02:07:33.980]  And in another video, which is also embedded in this article, they burn an American flag because it's very important to show your respect for democracy
[02:07:34.941 --> 02:07:43.345]  For this freedom that your ancestors fought and died for by burning the flag the very evening of that election.
[02:07:44.285 --> 02:07:57.692]  And again, as I write in the article, the irony of the riots is that many pro-Clinton media outlets previously circulated the talking point that Trump supporters would be likely to stage violent unrest after they lost the election.
[02:07:59.178 --> 02:08:04.842]  So again, we go to Twitter and these death threats, and you can see these in the article, I've screenshotted just a few of them.
[02:08:05.062 --> 02:08:05.902]  Just a few!
[02:08:06.983 --> 02:08:10.025]  Because obviously I was operating on two hours sleep this morning.
[02:08:10.505 --> 02:08:17.209]  I could have spent two, three hours going through Twitter this morning, screenshotting hundreds and hundreds of these tweets.
[02:08:17.249 --> 02:08:17.710]  And you can see!
[02:08:18.871 --> 02:08:30.876]  These are Hillary Clinton supporters, tolerant liberals, who of course lambasted conservatives back in 2012 for not accepting Obama's victory with open arms.
[02:08:31.336 --> 02:08:40.080]  Now they're out on Twitter whining, gnashing their teeth, writhing around, refusing to accept Donald Trump's victory.
[02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:46.663]  You've got hashtags trending right now, I'm still with her, and hashtag not my president,
[02:08:47.463 --> 02:08:55.431]  And if you go on the Twitter search and you type in the search term, kill Trump or shoot Trump, then this is the kind of tolerant liberalism that you will come up with.
[02:08:56.272 --> 02:09:00.476]  Quote, this is a tweet and it got 125 retweets.
[02:09:01.317 --> 02:09:03.700]  Someone, anyone, again this is a quote.
[02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:07.263]  Someone, anyone, please take a sniper rifle and kill Trump.
[02:09:07.664 --> 02:09:10.286]  Shoot him in the head and then it goes on after that.
[02:09:11.161 --> 02:09:17.145]  A tolerant liberal, again, saying that Donald Trump should be assassinated before he's allowed to take office.
[02:09:18.006 --> 02:09:23.870]  And they have the temerity to label Trump supporters violent and intolerant.
[02:09:24.211 --> 02:09:24.831]  Here's another one.
[02:09:25.472 --> 02:09:30.395]  I've never in my life wished death upon anyone, but dear God, I'm begging you, please kill Trump!
[02:09:32.117 --> 02:09:32.677]  Here's another one.
[02:09:32.717 --> 02:09:34.939]  Can someone just hire a serial killer and just kill Trump?
[02:09:36.385 --> 02:09:39.568]  Another Twitter user wrote, well we have two months to kill Trump.
[02:09:40.909 --> 02:09:43.291]  Because Lord knows they tried, didn't they?
[02:09:43.672 --> 02:09:48.656]  We had the British student who was arrested at a Donald Trump rally for trying to assassinate Trump.
[02:09:49.217 --> 02:09:50.638]  He tried to grab an officer's gun.
[02:09:50.918 --> 02:09:54.962]  We had the other guy who rushed the stage back in March, the media lionised him.
[02:09:55.382 --> 02:09:58.245]  We had the other incident a few days ago, where this
[02:09:59.426 --> 02:10:04.468]  Protested this disruptor, claimed to be a Republican, turned out to be a Hillary supporter.
[02:10:05.248 --> 02:10:08.249]  Tried to cause a disruption at the time, people thought he had a gun.
[02:10:08.369 --> 02:10:09.469]  Didn't turn out to be the case.
[02:10:09.890 --> 02:10:17.312]  But again, these tolerant liberals are all over Twitter, saying that Donald Trump should be assassinated before he's allowed to take office.
[02:10:17.812 --> 02:10:19.553]  Because again, they're progressive.
[02:10:20.053 --> 02:10:20.393]  Okay?
[02:10:21.013 --> 02:10:21.654]  Here's another one.
[02:10:22.274 --> 02:10:25.255]  So who's the black person that's going to take one for the team and kill Trump?
[02:10:26.604 --> 02:10:29.787]  And finally, death to Trump and all his supporters.
[02:10:30.228 --> 02:10:37.595]  And this individual has capped off his liberal tolerance by renaming his Twitter account, Kill Trump Now.
[02:10:40.922 --> 02:10:56.675]  So again, for weeks and months it was the media, the discredited media that has been proven completely wrong yet again, that said it was Donald Trump supporters that would riot, that would stage civil unrest after an election, within hours.
[02:10:57.575 --> 02:11:01.476]  It was Hillary Clinton supporters that were doing exactly that.
[02:11:02.116 --> 02:11:08.258]  And not only that, but violently threatening Donald Trump and his supporters on social media.
[02:11:08.938 --> 02:11:10.058]  That's happening right now.
[02:11:10.179 --> 02:11:11.979]  Obviously committing a crime.
[02:11:12.719 --> 02:11:14.280]  Threatening a President-elect.
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:19.221]  Secret Service will investigate if any of these tweets become widely circulated.
[02:11:19.621 --> 02:11:22.082]  The problem is the volume of them is just so vast.
[02:11:22.830 --> 02:11:26.231]  That many of these people will just get away with this and they just think it's a big joke.
[02:11:26.811 --> 02:11:31.153]  God forbid you would say the same thing about Obama, they'll be immediately on you.
[02:11:31.173 --> 02:11:40.116]  But again, it's just an insight into the complete intolerance, hatred and bigotry of Hillary Clinton supporters.
[02:11:40.796 --> 02:11:42.437]  In fact, you've seen it all over Twitter.
[02:11:42.597 --> 02:11:44.057]  I mentioned the hashtags before.
[02:11:44.718 --> 02:11:45.838]  I'm still with her.
[02:11:47.094 --> 02:11:48.676]  And hashtag not my president.
[02:11:49.156 --> 02:11:59.227]  So you've got all these Hillary Clinton supporting bedwetting morons all over Twitter whining and crying about how hate has won.
[02:11:59.968 --> 02:12:03.792]  Oh, misogyny has won, hate has won, homophobia has won.
[02:12:04.833 --> 02:12:16.918]  Even though, you know, Hillary Clinton, 20% of her campaign was funded by countries that literally execute gay people, but homophobia is one because Donald Trump was successful in the presidential election, okay?
[02:12:17.859 --> 02:12:20.940]  So they're all over Twitter whining about hate, hate is one, hate is one.
[02:12:21.380 --> 02:12:23.141]  You're the hateful ones, okay?
[02:12:23.441 --> 02:12:26.843]  You're the ones out there rioting on the streets, burning American flags.
[02:12:27.443 --> 02:12:30.364]  You're the ones out there threatening to kill Trump supporters.
[02:12:31.024 --> 02:12:35.486]  Threatening to kill people with whom you disagree politically is hateful.
[02:12:35.846 --> 02:12:37.267]  You're the hateful ones.
[02:12:38.127 --> 02:12:46.630]  So don't whine all day about hate and bigotry when you're the ultimate example of that and have been this entire election cycle.
[02:12:48.971 --> 02:12:52.613]  Again, their narrative has completely failed, you know.
[02:12:53.717 --> 02:13:02.260]  This is what I tweeted earlier, with a link to the Everyone I Don't Like is Hitler handbook, The Child's Guide to Emotional Discussion.
[02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:05.441]  You know, please keep using this term racist.
[02:13:05.861 --> 02:13:09.182]  Please keep bitching about us being effing white males.
[02:13:09.823 --> 02:13:14.985]  Please keep bitching about misogyny, rape culture, and the patriarchy.
[02:13:15.225 --> 02:13:18.926]  Because it's really proven to be a winning strategy for you, hasn't it?
[02:13:20.459 --> 02:13:21.741]  Over and over again, we saw it.
[02:13:22.261 --> 02:13:22.922]  With Brexit.
[02:13:23.082 --> 02:13:24.424]  The exact same thing.
[02:13:24.684 --> 02:13:25.905]  For weeks beforehand.
[02:13:26.406 --> 02:13:29.669]  Anyone who votes for Brexit is just a racist, how dare you!
[02:13:30.663 --> 02:13:32.404]  Let's socially ostracise you.
[02:13:32.424 --> 02:13:37.366]  I literally know people that were almost disowned by their parents for voting Brexit.
[02:13:37.946 --> 02:13:39.166]  They had to hide the fact.
[02:13:39.506 --> 02:13:43.348]  Again, because Liberals are completely intolerant of other people's opinions.
[02:13:43.808 --> 02:13:50.190]  They're all about diversity, apart from when it comes to diversity of opinion, and in fact now the polls prove that.
[02:13:50.851 --> 02:13:59.054]  Pew came out of the poll a few days ago which documented the fact that Trump supporters were more tolerant of Hillary supporters than vice versa.
[02:13:59.154 --> 02:13:59.354]  Again,
[02:14:00.034 --> 02:14:05.715]  Because conservatives are more tolerant generally of other people's opinions, even if they disagree with them.
[02:14:06.695 --> 02:14:12.916]  And yet we have this entire media narrative about how all Trump supporters are bigoted and racist.
[02:14:13.036 --> 02:14:26.439]  And in fact on that very point we have a clip from Van Jones from CNN last night who's basically trying to make the case that Donald Trump won because America hates Obama and America is racist.
[02:14:26.479 --> 02:14:27.339]  Let's go to that clip.
[02:14:32.155 --> 02:14:34.156]  It's hard to be a parent tonight for a lot of us.
[02:14:35.037 --> 02:14:37.318]  You tell your kids, don't be a bully.
[02:14:38.639 --> 02:14:40.700]  You tell your kids, don't be a bigot.
[02:14:41.721 --> 02:14:44.702]  You tell your kids, do your homework and be prepared.
[02:14:45.643 --> 02:14:49.045]  And then you have this outcome and you have people putting children to bed tonight.
[02:14:50.245 --> 02:14:51.726]  And they're afraid of breakfast.
[02:14:52.727 --> 02:14:55.268]  They're afraid of how do I explain this to my children?
[02:14:55.528 --> 02:15:00.271]  I have Muslim friends who are texting me tonight saying, should I leave the country?
[02:15:01.309 --> 02:15:05.495]  I have families of immigrants that are terrified tonight.
[02:15:06.917 --> 02:15:08.179]  This was many things.
[02:15:10.122 --> 02:15:12.224]  This was a rebellion against the elites.
[02:15:13.601 --> 02:15:13.921]  It's true.
[02:15:14.141 --> 02:15:18.105]  It was a complete reinvention of politics and polls.
[02:15:18.145 --> 02:15:18.525]  It's true.
[02:15:18.805 --> 02:15:20.066]  But it was also something else.
[02:15:20.086 --> 02:15:21.107]  We've talked about race.
[02:15:21.127 --> 02:15:23.109]  I mean, we've talked about everything but race tonight.
[02:15:23.129 --> 02:15:23.969]  We've talked about income.
[02:15:23.989 --> 02:15:24.690]  We've talked about class.
[02:15:24.710 --> 02:15:25.391]  We've talked about region.
[02:15:25.591 --> 02:15:26.612]  We haven't talked about race.
[02:15:26.932 --> 02:15:28.213]  This was a whitelash.
[02:15:28.993 --> 02:15:32.376]  This was a whitelash against a changing country.
[02:15:33.077 --> 02:15:36.199]  It was a whitelash against a black president, in part.
[02:15:36.940 --> 02:15:39.282]  And that's the part where the pain comes.
[02:15:40.953 --> 02:15:52.358]  So there was Van Jones on CNN last night saying that the election of Donald J. Trump was a whitelash, basically a racist backlash, against Barack Obama.
[02:15:53.238 --> 02:15:58.661]  Okay, the one problem with that is that many of the people who voted for Trump this time around
[02:15:59.724 --> 02:16:01.346]  Voted for Obama in 2012.
[02:16:03.088 --> 02:16:07.533]  Okay, so they're racist white rednecks who hate Obama because he's black.
[02:16:08.054 --> 02:16:09.416]  Yet they voted for him.
[02:16:09.876 --> 02:16:12.619]  That's essentially the essence of Van Jones' argument.
[02:16:13.493 --> 02:16:15.454]  And I can go into more detail on that.
[02:16:15.474 --> 02:16:16.774]  This is from the New York Times.
[02:16:17.354 --> 02:16:25.536]  The Wyoming River Valley of Pennsylvania, to take one example, which includes Scranton and Wickles Bar, voted for Mr. Trump.
[02:16:26.297 --> 02:16:31.398]  It had voted for Obama last time around by double digits.
[02:16:32.778 --> 02:16:39.600]  Okay, so they voted for Obama in double digits, but they're racist and they hate Obama because he's black and that's why they voted Trump, okay?
[02:16:40.401 --> 02:16:41.201]  Doesn't make sense.
[02:16:42.213 --> 02:16:48.357]  Here's another example, Youngstown, Ohio, where Mr. Obama won by more than 20 points in 2012.
[02:16:49.738 --> 02:16:51.459]  It was basically a draw.
[02:16:52.380 --> 02:17:02.926]  So again, many of those people voting for Trump, those racist white rednecks, as Van Jones would have it, voted for Obama in 2012 because they hate Obama because he's black.
[02:17:03.827 --> 02:17:04.888]  Again, doesn't make sense.
[02:17:05.288 --> 02:17:06.189]  Here's another example.
[02:17:07.216 --> 02:17:12.441]  Mr. Trump swept the string of traditionally democratic and old industrial towns along Lake Erie.
[02:17:12.942 --> 02:17:20.450]  Counties that supported Mr. Obama in 2012, this time around voted for Mr. Trump by 20 points.
[02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:22.351]  Yet another example.
[02:17:23.373 --> 02:17:26.856]  The rural countryside of the North swung overwhelmingly to Mr. Trump.
[02:17:27.796 --> 02:17:35.182]  Most obvious was Iowa, where Mr. Obama won easily in 2012, but Mr. Trump prevailed easily.
[02:17:35.983 --> 02:17:37.744]  So again, Obama won it handily in 2012.
[02:17:39.864 --> 02:17:45.087]  Having been voted for by a bunch of white racist rednecks who hate him because he's black.
[02:17:45.727 --> 02:17:47.128]  That's Van Jones' argument.
[02:17:47.628 --> 02:17:55.792]  If they're merely voting on the basis of being racist, then why did they all vote for Obama back in 2012?
[02:17:56.672 --> 02:17:58.633]  Kinda hard to explain that, isn't it?
[02:17:59.094 --> 02:18:01.755]  But again, it goes to the core of what we've seen all along.
[02:18:02.355 --> 02:18:03.636]  Which again, is this narrative.
[02:18:04.793 --> 02:18:09.056]  That Trump supporters are just racist bigots and that's the only reason they're voting for him.
[02:18:09.616 --> 02:18:23.425]  You know, it turns out that one of the very few people on the left that got it completely right, and of course he dismissed 50% of Trump supporters as racist bigots, but at least he got it right in one sense, and this was Michael Moore.
[02:18:24.266 --> 02:18:29.870]  Because he had the smarts, he was the one leftist who had the smarts to stop and think for a second.
[02:18:31.291 --> 02:18:37.923]  But maybe, just maybe, not all people who voted for Trump did so because they're racists or bigots.
[02:18:38.703 --> 02:19:06.558]  Remember, he got on Bill Maher, he got on Jake Tapper's show on CNN, and said, look, the people I speak to in Wisconsin and Michigan are voting for Trump because they lost their livelihoods, their jobs were destroyed by globalism, by NAFTA, by all these free trade deals, by the TPP, which is coming down the pipe, which Hillary Clinton claimed she opposed after it became unpopular, even though she said it was the gold standard before that.
[02:19:07.378 --> 02:19:12.822]  That's why those people in Wisconsin and Michigan voted for Donald Trump.
[02:19:13.483 --> 02:19:14.803]  Wisconsin went for Trump.
[02:19:15.584 --> 02:19:18.906]  Michigan, they still haven't counted the full ballot yet.
[02:19:19.667 --> 02:19:24.751]  It was significantly in favour of Trump as of late last night or early this morning.
[02:19:25.251 --> 02:19:28.453]  There's some shenanigans going on with that, but it's still leaning Trump.
[02:19:29.134 --> 02:19:31.676]  They haven't announced the final result, but again,
[02:19:33.004 --> 02:19:45.331]  Michael Moore was the only leftist that had the smarts to stop and think for a second that maybe, just maybe, people voted for Donald Trump in these areas based on real issues.
[02:19:45.891 --> 02:19:48.313]  And that was what came out of the exit polls, if anything.
[02:19:49.133 --> 02:19:53.896]  Many, many people across these states' primary concern was the economy.
[02:19:54.316 --> 02:19:55.717]  That's what they voted on.
[02:19:56.117 --> 02:20:01.040]  They didn't vote on the basis of hating Obama because of his skin color.
[02:20:02.213 --> 02:20:06.494]  They had voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012!
[02:20:08.275 --> 02:20:12.056]  So again, Van Jones' argument completely debunked.
[02:20:12.796 --> 02:20:17.317]  You also had the fact that 31% of eligible voters were non-white.
[02:20:18.258 --> 02:20:21.499]  So again, it wasn't a racist takeover of America.
[02:20:21.599 --> 02:20:29.401]  It's because you had an inherently corrupt, unlikable witch in Hillary Clinton and the entire campaign that surrounded her.
[02:20:30.916 --> 02:20:32.878]  And she was promising more of the same.
[02:20:32.958 --> 02:20:42.249]  People in Wisconsin, people in Michigan, people in these other states were sick to the back teeth of having their livelihoods destroyed by globalism.
[02:20:43.331 --> 02:20:45.213]  And they made their voices heard.
[02:20:45.914 --> 02:20:46.955]  They're not racists.
[02:20:47.436 --> 02:20:48.637]  They're American people.
[02:20:48.697 --> 02:20:49.598]  They care deeply.
[02:20:50.439 --> 02:20:52.699]  About the issues which affect their life.
[02:20:53.360 --> 02:20:58.020]  And that's why Donald Trump is now the 45th President of the United States.
[02:20:58.100 --> 02:21:03.361]  Not because of racism, but because of real issues that he has vowed to address.
[02:21:03.921 --> 02:21:05.222]  That he has promised to address.
[02:21:06.462 --> 02:21:09.402]  And which he hopefully will address, and that's another point that I want to get onto now.
[02:21:09.422 --> 02:21:13.703]  I'm going to take some of your calls in the second half of this hour, by the way.
[02:21:13.723 --> 02:21:15.884]  So get those rolling in.
[02:21:17.344 --> 02:21:17.544]  Again,
[02:21:18.467 --> 02:21:19.768]  We've promoted Donald Trump.
[02:21:19.808 --> 02:21:21.188]  We've not been shy about it.
[02:21:21.308 --> 02:21:23.410]  We've worn our bias on our sleeve.
[02:21:24.430 --> 02:21:26.871]  We don't pretend to be like the mainstream media.
[02:21:26.911 --> 02:21:30.033]  We don't pretend to be neutral and not have an agenda.
[02:21:30.313 --> 02:21:31.333]  We do have an agenda.
[02:21:31.614 --> 02:21:33.415]  We're open and honest about it.
[02:21:33.695 --> 02:21:34.255]  They're not.
[02:21:34.395 --> 02:21:35.496]  That's why they lost.
[02:21:35.936 --> 02:21:38.397]  That's why they were completely discredited.
[02:21:39.438 --> 02:21:42.119]  And again, our agenda was to promote Donald Trump because he stood up.
[02:21:42.159 --> 02:21:43.940]  He said, America first.
[02:21:45.265 --> 02:21:46.606]  We're getting rid of globalism.
[02:21:46.666 --> 02:21:48.107]  It's not working for the country.
[02:21:48.207 --> 02:21:49.768]  This is what our platform is about.
[02:21:49.788 --> 02:22:03.696]  Now, does that mean that we're now wedded to Donald Trump and that we will now defend everything he does or doesn't do after his inauguration in January and for the next four years or the next eight years?
[02:22:04.116 --> 02:22:05.257]  Well, no, it doesn't.
[02:22:05.477 --> 02:22:07.258]  In fact, it means the exact opposite.
[02:22:08.126 --> 02:22:16.589]  Myself, Alex Jones, has a proven track record of not being wedded to any individual politically or any political party.
[02:22:17.329 --> 02:22:18.850]  We're not wedded to Donald Trump.
[02:22:19.330 --> 02:22:21.530]  We're not wedded to the Republican Party.
[02:22:21.871 --> 02:22:23.651]  We're wedded to an ideology.
[02:22:24.431 --> 02:22:25.632]  So as long as Donald Trump
[02:22:26.837 --> 02:22:29.738]  If he embodies that ideology, then we will support him.
[02:22:30.159 --> 02:22:34.721]  If he deviates off from that, if he violates that, then we will criticise him.
[02:22:34.881 --> 02:22:41.604]  And you know that because you've been listening to this show, many of you, for, you know, 8, 10, 12, 14 years even.
[02:22:42.164 --> 02:22:44.786]  And that's what we've done all down the pike.
[02:22:44.846 --> 02:22:50.008]  We've never sided with any political party or any individual person.
[02:22:50.689 --> 02:22:52.650]  We've always sided with the ideology.
[02:22:53.690 --> 02:22:58.715]  So you had the media throughout this campaign complaining about demagoguery.
[02:22:59.456 --> 02:23:01.578]  You know, Donald Trump is just this demagogue.
[02:23:01.778 --> 02:23:02.699]  It's all about him.
[02:23:03.359 --> 02:23:04.821]  His supporters are cult-like.
[02:23:04.861 --> 02:23:07.063]  They're just throwing their support behind this demagogue.
[02:23:07.223 --> 02:23:08.304]  He's literally Hitler!
[02:23:09.405 --> 02:23:12.087]  You heard all that crap for months and months and months.
[02:23:12.901 --> 02:23:19.644]  Well that stops right here, right now, because obviously we're going to have fun for a couple of weeks with this victory.
[02:23:20.384 --> 02:23:27.287]  But, you know, just like with Brexit, which they're trying to seize back, they're trying to steal from us, the battle has only just begun.
[02:23:28.247 --> 02:23:34.470]  Now Trump has the Senate, he has the House, he has the Supreme Court pick, he's got basically a full mandate.
[02:23:35.731 --> 02:23:38.472]  But rest assured, we're going to hold his feet to the fire.
[02:23:39.366 --> 02:23:45.730]  We're going to ensure that his cabinet is not riddled with neocons, which is what they will probably attempt to do.
[02:23:46.750 --> 02:23:48.532]  You know, you've got people surrounding Trump.
[02:23:50.293 --> 02:23:51.794]  I mean, come on, Chris Christie.
[02:23:52.554 --> 02:23:59.118]  I wouldn't trust Chris Christie as far as I could throw him, which isn't very far given his ample size.
[02:23:59.798 --> 02:24:01.459]  But again, I don't trust Chris Christie.
[02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:05.242]  Rudy Giuliani, I remain to be convinced.
[02:24:06.055 --> 02:24:09.077]  And yeah, they've done great work for Trump over the past six months or so.
[02:24:09.818 --> 02:24:13.221]  But we're not going to just trust these people outright and everything they say.
[02:24:13.241 --> 02:24:16.363]  We're going to hold their feet to the fire, rest assured.
[02:24:17.404 --> 02:24:24.510]  Again, a Trump presidency, now that he's got this mandate, has to be about more than just a roadblock.
[02:24:25.631 --> 02:24:31.255]  You know, it has to be about more than just stopping what's happened so far under eight years of Obama.
[02:24:32.016 --> 02:24:35.299]  It has to be about reversing America's course.
[02:24:36.499 --> 02:24:47.729]  It has to be about leaving behind the European-style socialism that Obama embodied, leaving it in the dust, leaving it on the ash heap of history.
[02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:52.173]  And we're going to do that by holding Donald Trump to his word.
[02:24:53.374 --> 02:24:56.277]  We're not going to treat him as a demagogue.
[02:24:56.357 --> 02:24:58.999]  We're not going to trust everything he says, everything he does.
[02:24:59.740 --> 02:25:02.903]  We're going to call him out when he doesn't do what he said he was going to do.
[02:25:04.025 --> 02:25:06.346]  And you know that, the long-time listeners know that.
[02:25:06.987 --> 02:25:12.069]  We're not MSNBC, we're not Fox News, we don't get wedded to political parties.
[02:25:14.330 --> 02:25:24.415]  Now the other angle of this is, compare how Trump supporters are reacting right now compared to Obama supporters back in 2008.
[02:25:25.676 --> 02:25:29.058]  You remember the big hope and change, the big messianic figure Obama?
[02:25:30.003 --> 02:25:31.044]  Sweeping to victory.
[02:25:31.804 --> 02:25:34.766]  Look at how his supporters responded back in 2008.
[02:25:35.506 --> 02:25:36.207]  Do you remember?
[02:25:38.088 --> 02:25:39.329]  Now look at Trump supporters.
[02:25:40.049 --> 02:25:40.690]  Are they happy?
[02:25:40.930 --> 02:25:41.810]  Are they partying?
[02:25:42.771 --> 02:25:43.832]  After Trump's victory?
[02:25:43.952 --> 02:25:44.312]  Yes!
[02:25:45.453 --> 02:25:52.737]  But do they have this, you know, glazed over cult-like expression on their faces in adoration of Dear Leader?
[02:25:52.857 --> 02:25:55.799]  Which is what Obama supporters clearly had back in 2008.
[02:25:57.887 --> 02:25:58.067]  No.
[02:25:58.327 --> 02:26:00.569]  You see a very different reaction so far.
[02:26:01.349 --> 02:26:05.491]  That's the difference between Obama supporters and Trump supporters.
[02:26:07.533 --> 02:26:09.254]  I mean, we're going to hold his feet to the fire.
[02:26:09.314 --> 02:26:12.135]  He's going to be under a lot of pressure from his own people.
[02:26:12.856 --> 02:26:15.277]  Not to mention the media as we go forward.
[02:26:15.317 --> 02:26:16.798]  And of course that's a different argument.
[02:26:17.238 --> 02:26:18.499]  But a lot of people are saying,
[02:26:19.958 --> 02:26:23.299]  Oh no, he's going to be absolutely savaged by the media.
[02:26:23.359 --> 02:26:28.221]  He's not going to get the chance to go forward with his agenda because he's constantly going to be on the back foot.
[02:26:28.762 --> 02:26:32.603]  Well, he's been savaged by the media pretty much this entire campaign.
[02:26:33.043 --> 02:26:34.044]  And look what happened.
[02:26:34.064 --> 02:26:37.265]  So I don't think that's going to be a great worry for him going forward.
[02:26:38.610 --> 02:26:40.270]  After the break, we're going to get to your calls.
[02:26:40.811 --> 02:26:45.232]  And the call-in number is 877-789-ALEX.
[02:26:45.292 --> 02:26:46.232]  That's 877-789-ALEX.
[02:26:46.272 --> 02:26:52.234]  So we're going to go to a few of your calls after the break.
[02:26:53.374 --> 02:26:55.935]  Let's hit on a couple of news stories before we do that, though.
[02:26:56.775 --> 02:27:02.357]  We're going to get into the celebrities who have promised to leave America if Trump wins, which he did.
[02:27:02.637 --> 02:27:04.197]  So now they have to leave America.
[02:27:04.217 --> 02:27:07.098]  So we'll wait to see if that happens.
[02:27:08.134 --> 02:27:12.877]  But again, the Henny-Penny-Sky-Is-Falling-Frothing-Meltdown has already begun.
[02:27:13.457 --> 02:27:17.579]  Hillary supporters whining, rioting, threatening to kill Trump.
[02:27:18.300 --> 02:27:22.742]  Completely ungracious in defeat, even though Trump's been pretty gracious so far in victory.
[02:27:23.703 --> 02:27:28.546]  The Mirror is reporting French Ambassador to the USA says the world is collapsing.
[02:27:29.862 --> 02:27:30.603]  That's the quote.
[02:27:30.703 --> 02:27:34.486]  The world is collapsing as Donald Trump looks set to become president.
[02:27:34.867 --> 02:27:40.632]  Literally, the world is collapsing and burning up into a cinder because people voted for Donald Trump.
[02:27:41.092 --> 02:27:46.056]  The current French ambassador to the United States has tweeted that the world is collapsing before our eyes.
[02:27:47.421 --> 02:27:48.682]  That's an actual quote.
[02:27:49.663 --> 02:28:01.712]  As Donald Trump, that's even worse than literally Hitler, as Donald Trump looks set to become US President, Gerard Arraud, who is a serving ambassador, tweeted his remarks as forecasters predicted Trump would defeat Hillary Clinton.
[02:28:02.573 --> 02:28:07.577]  The 63-year-old said, after Brexit and this election, everything is now possible.
[02:28:08.117 --> 02:28:10.619]  A world is collapsing before our eyes.
[02:28:10.899 --> 02:28:11.460]  Dizziness.
[02:28:12.981 --> 02:28:16.565]  Well, the world is not collapsing.
[02:28:17.105 --> 02:28:19.088]  Your world is collapsing.
[02:28:19.668 --> 02:28:28.478]  Your world of globalism that doesn't represent the American people, that doesn't represent the citizens of Europe, that world is collapsing.
[02:28:28.798 --> 02:28:30.120]  It's a political collapse.
[02:28:30.740 --> 02:28:32.802]  It's not Armageddon, okay?
[02:28:33.463 --> 02:28:37.027]  Just take a back seat, take a deep breath, and calm down.
[02:28:37.628 --> 02:28:38.909]  The birds are still singing.
[02:28:39.530 --> 02:28:41.151]  You know, the grass is still growing.
[02:28:41.692 --> 02:28:43.534]  We haven't burned up into a cinder.
[02:28:44.295 --> 02:28:46.537]  Donald Trump hasn't adorned a Nazi uniform.
[02:28:46.557 --> 02:28:49.020]  He hasn't started putting anybody in concentration camps.
[02:28:49.501 --> 02:28:51.403]  Everything's going to be okay.
[02:28:52.654 --> 02:29:04.745]  But again, just one example of the frothing meltdown that we're already seeing in the very hours after the presidential election wound up last night, early this morning.
[02:29:04.765 --> 02:29:14.034]  We're going to go to a break now, but we will be back with your calls on the InfoWars Election Marathon Special 52-hour broadcast live.
[02:29:14.915 --> 02:29:16.016]  Your calls coming up.
[02:29:16.136 --> 02:29:16.717]  Stay tuned.
[02:29:29.485 --> 02:29:47.163]  My fellow Americans, my fellow humans on planet Earth, there is an epic, legendary awakening of nationalism and populism happening from the Brexit to the Donald Trump phenomenon to Russia pulling out of the New World Order and arresting the bankster oligarchs.
[02:29:47.884 --> 02:29:50.286]  Humanity's will for self-determination
[02:29:51.187 --> 02:29:53.029]  And freedom is expressing itself.
[02:29:53.509 --> 02:30:00.915]  The great classical liberalisms of Thomas Jefferson and Francis Bacon are reawakening right now.
[02:30:01.695 --> 02:30:10.882]  And it's because of the historical times we live in that InfoWars is going to embark on an unprecedented 52-hour broadcast.
[02:30:10.922 --> 02:30:16.447]  We've done 24-hour broadcasts before, but we've never gone 52 hours.
[02:30:16.987 --> 02:30:17.748]  This Monday,
[02:30:18.268 --> 02:30:19.669]  From 11 a.m.
[02:30:19.749 --> 02:30:25.411]  Central right through Tuesday right into Wednesday when the Wednesday show ends at 3 p.m.
[02:30:25.471 --> 02:30:38.918]  Central we will broadcast for an unprecedented legendary over-the-top 52 hours live the second great awakening is taking place we are in the dawn of a new
[02:30:39.818 --> 02:30:44.481]  The era of renaissance, of rediscovery, and human liberty.
[02:30:45.102 --> 02:30:58.211]  Donald Trump, the Brexit, Infowars, Matt Drudge, Breitbart, WorldNetDaily, and so many others are only one small manifestation in the fire of liberty that is now exploding across the globe.
[02:30:58.792 --> 02:31:00.413]  You can see it in the news.
[02:31:00.453 --> 02:31:01.353]  You can feel it.
[02:31:01.834 --> 02:31:03.015]  You can witness it on the street.
[02:31:03.675 --> 02:31:04.555]  History's happening.
[02:31:04.896 --> 02:31:09.058]  They always say this election is the most important in our lifetimes and we laugh it off.
[02:31:09.138 --> 02:31:12.639]  I wouldn't even get involved in past elections because they were so clearly frauds.
[02:31:13.300 --> 02:31:14.540]  This one's the big kahuna.
[02:31:15.341 --> 02:31:16.982]  A clear demarcation line.
[02:31:17.502 --> 02:31:20.964]  A crossroads between nationalism and tyranny.
[02:31:21.484 --> 02:31:23.645]  Between Americanism and globalism.
[02:31:24.345 --> 02:31:28.487]  That's why we're doing this one time and one time only, because history's happening.
[02:31:28.947 --> 02:31:37.111]  A 52-hour live transmission, kicking off Monday, November 7th, 2016 at 11am, running right through Election Day the 8th,
[02:31:40.632 --> 02:31:42.192]  End of the night at 3 p.m.
[02:31:42.232 --> 02:31:43.393]  and quite frankly beyond.
[02:31:43.753 --> 02:31:49.754]  It's historical and it's part of overthrowing the dinosaur media, not just overthrowing the two-party corrupt system.
[02:31:50.254 --> 02:31:55.955]  I want to see 10 million viewers tune in over the 50 plus hours and that's where you come in.
[02:31:56.395 --> 02:31:58.115]  You are the heart and blood of the InfoWar.
[02:31:58.435 --> 02:32:08.137]  If you spread the link to InfoWars.com forward slash show and point out that this is the alternative new media, this is the rebellion, this is the modern Paul Revere operation,
[02:32:08.737 --> 02:32:12.259]  Then all of you are riding right beside us, not behind us.
[02:32:12.620 --> 02:32:19.204]  So spread the word by Paul Revere's, no matter where you live in the world, to Information Warfare Arms.
[02:32:19.524 --> 02:32:22.666]  The globalists are coming and they will be met on the field.
[02:32:24.507 --> 02:32:25.788]  Infowars.com.
[02:32:26.149 --> 02:32:26.749]  Powered by 1776.
[02:32:47.145 --> 02:32:50.969]  We're back live on this InfoWars marathon election special.
[02:32:51.049 --> 02:32:54.073]  Hillary Clinton is about to give her concession speech.
[02:32:54.133 --> 02:32:55.254]  At least we hope she is.
[02:32:55.635 --> 02:32:56.776]  She didn't last night.
[02:32:56.956 --> 02:33:00.640]  God knows what she could say given the dirty tricks that they've pulled in the past.
[02:33:01.221 --> 02:33:03.003]  She's about to give her concession speech.
[02:33:03.043 --> 02:33:04.625]  They're playing hip-hop music.
[02:33:05.105 --> 02:33:07.908]  They're trying to keep the crowd energized for some reason.
[02:33:08.909 --> 02:33:14.492]  Even though, you know, it's going to be a huge letdown for them, there's going to be more whining and crying.
[02:33:14.892 --> 02:33:16.033]  So we're waiting on that.
[02:33:16.053 --> 02:33:17.874]  We'll cut to that as and when it takes place.
[02:33:18.194 --> 02:33:19.935]  Let's go to some of these calls first, though.
[02:33:20.515 --> 02:33:22.736]  Sebastian in Virginia.
[02:33:22.776 --> 02:33:23.957]  You're on the air, Sebastian.
[02:33:23.977 --> 02:33:24.377]  Go ahead.
[02:33:28.939 --> 02:33:29.540]  Love your show.
[02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:30.920]  Been following it for a long time.
[02:33:31.060 --> 02:33:31.721]  You guys are great.
[02:33:32.361 --> 02:33:33.281]  Keep doing what you're doing.
[02:33:33.301 --> 02:33:36.123]  Thanks.
[02:33:36.203 --> 02:33:36.763]  Appreciate it.
[02:33:36.823 --> 02:33:38.064]  What's in your mind today?
[02:33:38.928 --> 02:34:01.503]  So second off, from an outsider's perspective, because I'm originally, I'm Canadian, I'm in the States and I've sort of been witnessed from the outside of this whole thing unfolding, and I find it so interesting, especially coming from the perspective of my Canadian fellows, to see how
[02:34:03.727 --> 02:34:05.248]  There's a refusal of discussion?
[02:34:05.368 --> 02:34:09.209]  You know, I mean, I don't even think and I mean, I didn't side with anyone either.
[02:34:09.229 --> 02:34:12.930]  And I can't you know, I don't have a right to vote.
[02:34:12.990 --> 02:34:18.512]  But I mean, I think there's a there's a movement of people that want to change.
[02:34:18.892 --> 02:34:21.293]  And I think that they saw something different.
[02:34:21.453 --> 02:34:24.754]  And that is something that people have been trying to
[02:34:25.595 --> 02:34:32.700]  To grasp onto for a while, and finally you're somebody in a position where they could have that opportunity to be represented for.
[02:34:32.900 --> 02:34:37.863]  And sure, there's a lot of slander going around about Trump.
[02:34:38.223 --> 02:34:49.991]  And I think it's most surprising to me that, especially after the election was over, the negative, hateful, aggressive, and just violent comments, even on social media.
[02:34:50.191 --> 02:34:55.255]  And I found it so surprising, even coming from my friends in Canada.
[02:34:56.337 --> 02:35:19.664]  I mean it was just, you know, and it comes from, you know, I considered all my friends to be, and all the people and my colleagues that I know up there, to be open and respective and to, you know, accept views and have discussions and everybody just sort of went blinders up, violent, you know, swearing at people and I thought it was so interesting that there's so much violent discussion on the social media and as soon as somebody even points out
[02:35:20.672 --> 02:35:24.594]  An alternate view, not even supporting what happened, not even supporting the results.
[02:35:25.234 --> 02:35:30.737]  Just saying, well, maybe this is an indication that there was something wrong and something had to be done about it.
[02:35:31.277 --> 02:35:37.180]  They just shut down and swearing and you're a moron and I was just blown, I'm literally blown away by it.
[02:35:37.420 --> 02:35:40.562]  Like I'm just sort of here as a bystander and I'm just, I'm overwhelmed.
[02:35:41.215 --> 02:35:41.495]  Really?
[02:35:42.156 --> 02:35:44.057]  No, I mean, that's exactly the point.
[02:35:44.097 --> 02:35:46.099]  I mean, we saw it after Brexit.
[02:35:46.439 --> 02:35:49.021]  I know people that were almost disowned by their families.
[02:35:49.282 --> 02:35:58.689]  I know Brexit supporters that couldn't tell anyone that they had voted for Brexit, couldn't go into their workplace and actually talk about it for fear of reprisals.
[02:35:59.290 --> 02:36:08.658]  And again, we saw with the polls, and this is something we predicted all along the way, were people telling the pollsters that they were going to vote for Clinton or that they weren't going to vote for Trump?
[02:36:09.418 --> 02:36:22.542]  Simply to avoid that social ostracization that was very apparent over the past several months that if you supported Trump you were a bigot, you were a racist, you were basically trash, you were basically scum.
[02:36:22.962 --> 02:36:24.662]  That's exactly what transpired.
[02:36:24.722 --> 02:36:26.363]  We were completely correct in that.
[02:36:26.963 --> 02:36:30.947]  People weren't telling the pollsters what they were thinking, how they were going to vote.
[02:36:31.427 --> 02:36:33.089]  The polls have been completely debunked.
[02:36:33.409 --> 02:36:34.770]  They've got no credibility.
[02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:36.252]  The same thing happened with Brexit.
[02:36:36.712 --> 02:36:44.199]  And then the other angle of it, as you said, is when will the left look in the mirror and realize... Hey Paul, sorry to cut in, this is Nico.
[02:36:44.279 --> 02:36:49.244]  Tim Kaine is speaking ahead of Hillary Clinton's concession speech and we have the feed ready to go to.
[02:36:49.264 --> 02:36:52.547]  Let me just say, this will be a day long remembered.
[02:36:54.778 --> 02:36:57.681]  I want to thank Hillary Clinton for asking Anne and I to join this wild ride.
[02:36:57.701 --> 02:37:01.505]  About a week before she asked if I would be her running mate,
[02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:33.281]  And I went up to Westchester and we sat down with Hillary and Bill and with Chelsea and Mark and with Charlotte and Aiden for about three hours of conversation to try to determine whether we would be the right people to be on the ticket and when we got
[02:37:33.881 --> 02:37:44.568]  In the car to head back to the airport after the three-hour discussion, I said to Anne, Honey, I don't know whether we're going to be on this ticket or not, but I do know this, we're going to remember that three hours for the rest of our life.
[02:37:45.049 --> 02:37:52.674]  And now we will remember 105 days that we've had with this fantastic couple of public servants and all of you for the rest of our life.
[02:37:53.614 --> 02:37:59.238]  I'll just say this, Hillary and I know well the wisdom and the words of William Faulkner.
[02:37:59.518 --> 02:38:01.960]  He said, they killed us, but they ain't whooped us yet.
[02:38:03.301 --> 02:38:03.981]  They killed us.
[02:38:05.082 --> 02:38:05.782]  They killed us.
[02:38:07.262 --> 02:38:09.103]  But they ain't whooped us yet.
[02:38:10.603 --> 02:38:20.646]  Because... Because... Because we know... We know that the work remains.
[02:38:22.446 --> 02:38:24.967]  We know that...
[02:38:26.033 --> 02:38:47.545]  The dreams of empowering families and children remain, and in that work, that important work that we have to do as a nation, it is so comforting, even at a tough time, to know that Hillary Clinton is somebody, until her very last breath, is going to be battling for the values that make this nation great, and the values that we care so deeply about.
[02:38:47.585 --> 02:38:51.648]  So now, please join me in welcoming Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[02:39:21.203 --> 02:39:21.443]  Thank you.
[02:39:21.503 --> 02:39:21.824]  Thank you all.
[02:39:21.884 --> 02:39:22.124]  Thank you.
[02:39:22.144 --> 02:39:22.724]  Thank you all very much.
[02:39:22.744 --> 02:39:22.925]  Thank you.
[02:39:48.934 --> 02:39:49.715]  Thank you.
[02:39:49.995 --> 02:39:51.216]  Thank you so much.
[02:39:51.236 --> 02:39:57.680]  Very rowdy group.
[02:40:02.203 --> 02:40:03.283]  Thank you, my friends.
[02:40:03.424 --> 02:40:03.984]  Thank you.
[02:40:04.724 --> 02:40:05.365]  Thank you.
[02:40:06.025 --> 02:40:08.907]  Thank you so very much for being here.
[02:40:09.507 --> 02:40:10.968]  And I love you all, too.
[02:40:12.988 --> 02:40:18.932]  Last night I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country.
[02:40:19.893 --> 02:40:24.937]  I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans.
[02:40:26.137 --> 02:40:38.307]  This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for and I'm sorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country.
[02:40:39.067 --> 02:40:39.808]  But I feel
[02:40:41.750 --> 02:40:47.432]  I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together.
[02:40:47.452 --> 02:40:54.155]  This vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign.
[02:40:55.055 --> 02:41:01.458]  You represent the best of America and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life.
[02:41:14.013 --> 02:41:20.042]  I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it too.
[02:41:21.354 --> 02:41:27.598]  And so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort.
[02:41:28.579 --> 02:41:32.162]  This is painful, and it will be for a long time.
[02:41:33.082 --> 02:41:34.583]  But I want you to remember this.
[02:41:35.544 --> 02:41:40.467]  Our campaign was never about one person or even one election.
[02:41:41.468 --> 02:41:49.193]  It was about the country we love, and about building an America that's hopeful, inclusive, and big-hearted.
[02:41:50.274 --> 02:41:55.236]  We have seen that our nation is more divided than we thought.
[02:41:56.237 --> 02:41:59.719]  But I still believe in America and I always will.
[02:42:00.719 --> 02:42:06.122]  And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future.
[02:42:06.982 --> 02:42:09.503]  Donald Trump is going to be our president.
[02:42:10.123 --> 02:42:13.605]  We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.
[02:42:14.585 --> 02:42:17.407]  Our constitutional democracy enshrines
[02:42:18.038 --> 02:42:20.159]  The peaceful transfer of power.
[02:42:21.160 --> 02:42:22.701]  And we don't just respect that.
[02:42:23.341 --> 02:42:24.202]  We cherish it.
[02:42:25.123 --> 02:42:27.124]  It also enshrines other things.
[02:42:27.904 --> 02:42:28.705]  The rule of law.
[02:42:29.625 --> 02:42:33.528]  The principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity.
[02:42:34.248 --> 02:42:36.690]  Freedom of worship and expression.
[02:42:37.510 --> 02:42:40.812]  We respect and cherish these values too.
[02:42:41.373 --> 02:42:42.794]  And we must defend them.
[02:42:57.121 --> 02:43:02.703]  And let me add, our constitutional democracy demands our participation.
[02:43:03.203 --> 02:43:06.184]  Not just every four years, but all the time.
[02:43:07.264 --> 02:43:13.547]  So let's do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear.
[02:43:14.631 --> 02:43:18.314]  Making our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top.
[02:43:18.934 --> 02:43:22.337]  Protecting our country and protecting our planet.
[02:43:22.997 --> 02:43:28.482]  And breaking down all the barriers that hold any American back from achieving their dreams.
[02:43:29.562 --> 02:43:30.803]  We've spent a year and a half
[02:43:31.664 --> 02:43:43.033]  Bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American Dream is big enough for everyone.
[02:43:43.454 --> 02:43:53.001]  For people of all races and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities.
[02:43:53.101 --> 02:43:54.523]  For everyone.
[02:44:08.112 --> 02:44:19.477]  So now, our responsibility as citizens is to keep doing our part to build that better, stronger, fairer America we seek.
[02:44:20.137 --> 02:44:21.357]  And I know you will.
[02:44:22.538 --> 02:44:25.179]  I am so grateful to stand with all of you.
[02:44:25.199 --> 02:44:32.442]  I want to thank Tim Kaine and Ann Holton for being our partners on this journey.
[02:44:39.935 --> 02:44:53.080]  It has been a joy getting to know them better, and it gives me great hope and comfort to know that Tim will remain on the front lines of our democracy, representing Virginia in the Senate.
[02:45:01.844 --> 02:45:08.827]  To Barack and Michelle Obama, our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude.
[02:45:28.751 --> 02:45:40.875]  We thank you for your graceful, determined leadership that has meant so much to so many Americans and people across the world.
[02:45:42.275 --> 02:45:43.836]  And to Bill and Chelsea,
[02:45:44.921 --> 02:45:54.146]  Mark, Charlotte, Aiden, our brothers and our entire family, my love for you means more than I can ever express.
[02:45:55.146 --> 02:46:01.530]  You crisscrossed this country on our behalf and lifted me up when I needed it most.
[02:46:01.810 --> 02:46:05.392]  Even four-month-old Aiden, who traveled with his mom.
[02:46:06.593 --> 02:46:10.575]  I will always be grateful to the creative,
[02:46:11.570 --> 02:46:19.421]  Talented, dedicated men and women at our headquarters in Brooklyn and across our country.
[02:46:33.357 --> 02:46:36.099]  You poured your hearts into this campaign.
[02:46:36.159 --> 02:46:42.702]  For some of you who are veterans, it was a campaign after you had done other campaigns.
[02:46:42.802 --> 02:46:45.024]  Some of you, it was your first campaign.
[02:46:45.644 --> 02:46:53.849]  I want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anybody could have ever expected or wanted.
[02:47:00.976 --> 02:47:17.360]  And to the millions of volunteers, community leaders, activists, and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to neighbors, posted on Facebook, even in secret private Facebook sites.
[02:47:20.781 --> 02:47:26.463]  I want everybody coming out from behind that and make sure your voices are heard going forward.
[02:47:34.622 --> 02:47:41.367]  To everyone who sent in contributions as small as $5 and kept us going, thank you.
[02:47:41.627 --> 02:47:42.888]  Thank you from all of us.
[02:47:43.649 --> 02:47:48.092]  And to the young people in particular, I hope you will hear this.
[02:47:49.213 --> 02:47:55.358]  I have, as Tim said, spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in.
[02:47:56.379 --> 02:47:58.901]  I've had successes and I've had setbacks.
[02:47:59.601 --> 02:48:01.503]  Sometimes really painful ones.
[02:48:02.933 --> 02:48:09.059]  Many of you are at the beginning of your professional, public, and political careers.
[02:48:09.980 --> 02:48:12.803]  You will have successes and setbacks too.
[02:48:13.824 --> 02:48:14.825]  This loss hurts.
[02:48:15.686 --> 02:48:22.373]  But please, never stop believing that fighting for what's right is worth it.
[02:48:46.753 --> 02:48:47.213]  It is.
[02:48:47.814 --> 02:48:50.776]  It is worth it.
[02:48:51.857 --> 02:48:59.243]  And so, we need you to keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives.
[02:49:00.684 --> 02:49:14.335]  And to all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion.
[02:49:35.527 --> 02:49:57.972]  I know, I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.
[02:50:00.633 --> 02:50:03.694]  And to all the little girls who are watching this,
[02:50:04.844 --> 02:50:18.073]  Never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.
[02:50:27.740 --> 02:50:30.402]  Finally, I am so grateful for
[02:50:31.852 --> 02:50:34.794]  Our country and for all it has given to me.
[02:50:36.155 --> 02:50:40.859]  I count my blessings every single day that I am an American.
[02:50:41.840 --> 02:50:59.734]  And I still believe, as deeply as I ever have, that if we stand together and work together, with respect for our differences, strength in our convictions, and love for this nation, our best days are still ahead of us.
[02:51:10.436 --> 02:51:17.349]  Because you know, you know I believe we are stronger together and we will go forward together.
[02:51:19.105 --> 02:51:23.146]  And you should never, ever regret fighting for that.
[02:51:23.166 --> 02:51:33.409]  You know, scripture tells us, let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart.
[02:51:34.069 --> 02:51:36.850]  So my friends, let us have faith in each other.
[02:51:37.490 --> 02:51:38.970]  Let us not grow weary.
[02:51:39.110 --> 02:51:40.411]  Let us not lose heart.
[02:51:40.911 --> 02:51:45.052]  For there are more seasons to come, and there is more work to do.
[02:51:46.013 --> 02:51:55.261]  I am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election.
[02:51:55.321 --> 02:51:58.765]  May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America!
[02:52:04.184 --> 02:52:08.726]  There goes sick Hillary Clinton with Bill Clinton chewing his tongue again behind her.
[02:52:09.146 --> 02:52:11.447]  That was not a concession speech, okay?
[02:52:11.807 --> 02:52:14.608]  That was an angry admonishment of Donald Trump.
[02:52:15.128 --> 02:52:20.951]  You saw Trump's speech last night, incredibly graceful, gracious towards Hillary Clinton.
[02:52:21.191 --> 02:52:23.892]  Compare his speech with what you just heard.
[02:52:24.272 --> 02:52:26.453]  Again, she brought up the religious thing, the Muslim thing.
[02:52:26.813 --> 02:52:29.734]  She even dipped into the global warming issue.
[02:52:30.254 --> 02:52:32.015]  That was not a concession speech.
[02:52:32.315 --> 02:52:33.916]  That was not conciliatory.
[02:52:34.236 --> 02:52:36.078]  That was an admonishment of Donald Trump.
[02:52:36.098 --> 02:52:44.622]  Then she has the temerity at the end to say how great of an example she is for young women and that they should still have hope going forward.
[02:52:44.963 --> 02:52:51.146]  This is a woman whose campaign is literally funded by countries that treat women like farmyard animals.
[02:52:51.446 --> 02:52:57.130]  So don't come at me with that feminist, fake, women's rights crap once again.
[02:52:57.990 --> 02:53:01.693]  Absolutely despicable behaviour from sick Hillary Clinton.
[02:53:01.973 --> 02:53:03.854]  She's supposed to give a concession speech.
[02:53:04.374 --> 02:53:06.496]  She ends up going on an angry rant.
[02:53:06.576 --> 02:53:08.877]  Again, it was etched into her face.
[02:53:10.118 --> 02:53:13.840]  Coming up, Alex Jones with the first official broadcast post-election.
[02:53:14.301 --> 02:53:15.962]  Breaking news at Infowars.com.
[02:53:16.002 --> 02:53:17.803]  Stay tuned, Alex is coming right up.
[02:53:39.767 --> 02:53:47.691]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[02:53:47.751 --> 02:53:53.474]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe, and they're also very affordable.
[02:53:53.494 --> 02:53:53.834]  Exactly.
[02:53:53.854 --> 02:53:55.635]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[02:53:55.655 --> 02:53:57.156]  You talk about we're an industry.
