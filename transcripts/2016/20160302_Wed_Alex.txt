[00:00:08.223 --> 00:00:12.405]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:13.866]  You want answers?
[00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:15.527]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:16.208 --> 00:00:19.830]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.453]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.121]  Wow!
[00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:45.017]  Super Tuesday was incredible and there's so many other big global developments that we're going to be breaking down here today on this March 2nd, 2016 Global Wednesday Transmission.
[00:00:46.138 --> 00:00:49.739]  But really the biggest thing to come out of this is the mantra that is so true.
[00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.499]  You rarely hear mantras in politics that are true.
[00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.440]  They're normally establishment mantras.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:06.262]  But the mantra that regardless of who Donald Trump is, he is a focal point of revolution and a peaceful overthrow of an illegitimate government run by offshore special interest.
[00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:08.983]  And Mike Huckabee
[00:01:10.452 --> 00:01:13.254]  Former Arkansas governor has come out and said it all.
[00:01:13.734 --> 00:01:16.776]  Says Trump phenomenon is a peaceful overthrow of the government.
[00:01:18.217 --> 00:01:21.379]  Because Trump's saying we're going to put America first.
[00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.000]  Globalism is all about looting America.
[00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:27.583]  And Trump knows this, but he dumbs it down to the public.
[00:01:27.623 --> 00:01:34.667]  He says, we have dumb leaders who make dumb deals with China and Mexico and India and all these other nations.
[00:01:36.108 --> 00:01:37.048]  We have dumb leaders.
[00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:39.050]  The deals are so one-sided.
[00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:40.962]  They're not dumb.
[00:01:41.822 --> 00:01:50.126]  This is global government where we were sold off and Europe was sold off from Ireland to Germany to Canada to the United States to Australia.
[00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:56.966]  Key infrastructure, the Panama Canal, all the rare earth minerals in Australia were just given.
[00:01:57.506 --> 00:02:02.289]  People wonder why the Communist Chinese government has 99% in Australia of rare earth minerals.
[00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:08.192]  It's because they don't let Australian, or British, or US, or German, or Dutch, or French companies operate.
[00:02:08.873 --> 00:02:12.775]  This is strategic, global government where they carve it all up.
[00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:18.893]  And China's broken some of its deals with the globalists is why major fleets are off their coast right now.
[00:02:19.553 --> 00:02:24.137]  Because they weren't supposed to move militarily, they were to be given economic power.
[00:02:25.118 --> 00:02:29.021]  The United States will be the military power with NATO as the world army.
[00:02:29.702 --> 00:02:31.944]  China has double-crossed the globalists.
[00:02:32.898 --> 00:02:40.219]  And the Russkies aren't going along with it either, but they are even more mistrustful of the Chinese, because the Chinese government tried to get the U.S.
[00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:44.980]  to do a joint strike twice on Moscow in the 50s and 60s.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.961]  It's all coming up today, the real history of the world and beyond.
[00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:49.921]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:58.483]  We've got a lot of big guests and more coming up, but first, the incredible statements, the truth, the veritas flooding from the mouth of Huckabee.
[00:02:59.707 --> 00:03:10.514]  You know, look, Donald Trump disavowed David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan so many times from Friday through Monday that, you know, the one time that he seemed to stumble a little bit, he said it was his earpiece.
[00:03:10.674 --> 00:03:12.495]  I don't know what he heard in his earpiece because I wasn't there.
[00:03:13.035 --> 00:03:19.659]  But I don't think there's any question that Donald Trump is not some kind of racist bigot and for people to pretend it, that's our big concern.
[00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.701]  And I thought Donald Trump last night in his press conference,
[00:03:23.781 --> 00:03:27.983]  I thought that was a stroke of genius, and he came across very conciliatory.
[00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:41.367]  He was a lot nicer to Ryan than Ryan was to him, and Paul Ryan and other people in Washington need to recognize the reason that Trump is winning is because they feel like people in Washington have helped them lose, and they're sick of it.
[00:03:41.427 --> 00:03:46.068]  They've worked hard to get him elected, and when they get there, they don't do anything different, and I'll tell you why.
[00:03:46.548 --> 00:03:47.108]  Three words.
[00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:48.069]  Follow the money.
[00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.952]  The donor class runs the political environment of this country and people are waking up to that and they are tired of it.
[00:03:54.452 --> 00:03:57.034]  And that's what this election is largely about.
[00:03:57.414 --> 00:03:59.555]  It's an overthrow of the government and you know what we ought to be?
[00:04:00.035 --> 00:04:05.258]  Glad that it is a peaceful revolution with ballots rather than one with bullets.
[00:04:05.938 --> 00:04:11.281]  And we're having in many ways somewhat of a political revolution in the Republican Party and in the country.
[00:04:15.572 --> 00:04:16.553]  Bravo Huckabee!
[00:04:16.853 --> 00:04:17.494]  Veritas!
[00:04:18.595 --> 00:04:20.316]  And this psyop almost got to me.
[00:04:20.457 --> 00:04:21.978]  On Friday he disavowed the Klan.
[00:04:22.538 --> 00:04:24.480]  He did it 15 years ago on his own.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.422]  Left the Reform Party because Duke got involved.
[00:04:26.842 --> 00:04:28.024]  Without the media even saying anything.
[00:04:28.064 --> 00:04:30.306]  I went back to the old New York Times article about it.
[00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.173]  And then he did it more than 12 times I was able to find.
[00:04:34.213 --> 00:04:34.894]  It was like a psy-op.
[00:04:34.934 --> 00:04:37.717]  By Sunday I went, it's like up here in the media say disavow, disavow.
[00:04:37.737 --> 00:04:40.099]  And I went, I saw the tweets, I saw them on TV.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.002]  So I finally went and found more than a dozen examples.
[00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:45.305]  And finally last night, he was asked three times.
[00:04:45.345 --> 00:04:47.047]  He kept saying, I disavow, I disavow, I disavow.
[00:04:47.507 --> 00:04:48.708]  And then again he goes, stop it!
[00:04:48.748 --> 00:04:49.749]  I just disavowed it here!
[00:04:50.814 --> 00:04:51.534]  But that's their game.
[00:04:51.594 --> 00:04:52.655]  He won't disavow.
[00:04:52.775 --> 00:04:57.616]  Fox, CNN, MSNBC lying to their viewers saying he didn't disavow.
[00:04:58.056 --> 00:05:01.997]  And then one time turning his earpiece off in the middle of all the disavowing.
[00:05:02.037 --> 00:05:11.140]  Two Roman Catholic bishops who led a central Pennsylvania diocese helped cover up the sexual abuse of hundreds of children by over 50 priests or religious leaders.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:18.569]  Over a 40-year period, according to a grand jury report issued Tuesday, reports Fox News.
[00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:30.403]  The 147-page report on sexual abuse in the local diocese was based partly on evidence from a secret archive uncovered through a search warrant executed in August, said Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane.
[00:05:30.523 --> 00:05:31.364]  We're good to go.
[00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:51.461]  No criminal charges are being filed in the case, because some abusers have died.
[00:05:51.621 --> 00:05:57.684]  The statute of limitations has expired, and in some cases, the victims are too traumatized to testify, she said.
[00:05:57.844 --> 00:06:01.526]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:06:01.926 --> 00:06:06.288]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:06:06.568 --> 00:06:11.169]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.330]  Talk about the effects.
[00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.130]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.771]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:06:16.091 --> 00:06:17.151]  I feel like I look better.
[00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:17.872]  I feel better.
[00:06:17.912 --> 00:06:19.012]  I feel sexier.
[00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:19.692]  I love it.
[00:06:19.952 --> 00:06:22.853]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:06:22.913 --> 00:06:25.614]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[00:06:25.854 --> 00:06:26.875]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:06:26.915 --> 00:06:27.956]  Consult your physician.

[00:06:30.477 --> 00:06:31.438]  This is life changing.

[00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:10.669]  It is Wednesday, my friends.
[00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:12.911]  Hard to believe you're already well in
[00:08:39.281 --> 00:08:40.786]  To the third month of 2016.
[00:08:40.846 --> 00:08:43.214]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:46.946 --> 00:08:52.767]  Here's an article from Infowars.com, a New American Magazine story by William F. Jasper.
[00:08:53.548 --> 00:09:00.269]  Globalist insider Larry Summers, Trump is a serious threat to American, quote, democracy.
[00:09:00.989 --> 00:09:02.850]  These are the people that have hijacked our nation.
[00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.090]  We're seeing a populist movement.
[00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:11.932]  And then Larry Summers that engineered the derivative scams, everything that we're currently under during the Clinton administration.
[00:09:13.271 --> 00:09:18.434]  Who has helped shackle this nation to foreign debt that we don't even own or owe.
[00:09:21.496 --> 00:09:25.239]  And he's saying that Trump is a threat to, quote, democracy.
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.382]  No, he's a threat to people that are a threat to our republic.
[00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:32.804]  And I'm going to play this clip again.
[00:09:32.824 --> 00:09:41.470]  It is a clip from Fox News last night with Huckabee, Governor Huckabee.
[00:09:42.634 --> 00:09:49.816]  Saying Donald Trump represents a phenomenon of a peaceful overthrow of the government.
[00:09:50.976 --> 00:09:52.936]  And that's what the Declaration of Independence is.
[00:09:54.277 --> 00:09:56.357]  A statement that we have a right to remove governments.
[00:09:56.717 --> 00:09:58.117]  And that's what elections are.
[00:09:59.678 --> 00:10:06.739]  And now via political correctness and foreign donors and money, they are trying to shut down and checkmate the American people.
[00:10:07.059 --> 00:10:09.800]  Quite frankly, Donald Trump is pretty milquetoast.
[00:10:12.557 --> 00:10:22.799]  But they invert reality and make it sound bizarre, when first he's like, yeah, we gotta bring in the refugees, our government helped put ISIS in, and now they're killing all these people, we gotta protect them.
[00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:26.400]  And he goes, oh, wait a minute, they're radical jihadis, a bunch of them, and they're not vetting them?
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.861]  They're not checking their passports?
[00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:30.781]  They're not even, we'll stop all of them until we know!
[00:10:30.801 --> 00:10:39.944]  That's like locking your door at night, and they just act like that's the end of the world.
[00:10:40.204 --> 00:10:41.164]  This is what they do.
[00:10:43.171 --> 00:10:46.393]  They count on people not checking the facts, so I want to go over this.
[00:10:47.033 --> 00:10:51.415]  Here's the problem, and I'm going to get Roger Stone back on today, I'm going to get other political analysts on as well.
[00:10:53.416 --> 00:11:02.540]  Donald Trump to stop a broker convention at the RNC coming up in a few months needs over 50% of the delegates.
[00:11:04.761 --> 00:11:11.845]  The other candidates last night, Cruz in second, Rubio in third, Kasich
[00:11:12.808 --> 00:11:19.732]  In fourth, Ben Carson in fifth, got 365 delegates total.
[00:11:21.934 --> 00:11:22.894]  Donald Trump got 316.
[00:11:23.154 --> 00:11:40.585]  And if that strategy continues, they will be able to steal the nomination or force him to take a vice president bare minimum at the RNC coming up.
[00:11:44.315 --> 00:11:51.019]  Now we have two reports coming up, one that Jakari Jackson shot, they're both excellent, the other that Joe Biggs shot with a local news station.
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:12:13.192]  They got at least a dozen calls in an hour on one of the news shows, and then more in the newsroom, that no, we try to vote in Travis County, but also in Round Rock, in Williamson County, north of Austin where I sit, here in the heart of Texas, and it would flip to Rubio or Cruz.
[00:12:15.222 --> 00:12:23.149]  And then I have personally gotten calls from longtime friends and others, one of my former producers, whose wife had hers flipped.
[00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:30.435]  And by the way, she works in computers for 30 years, so she knows what she's doing.
[00:12:31.256 --> 00:12:33.578]  She said, no, it kept flipping, kept flipping, kept flipping.
[00:12:34.719 --> 00:12:37.321]  And then we also talked to an election judge off camera.
[00:12:37.341 --> 00:12:38.082]  He wouldn't be on camera.
[00:12:38.102 --> 00:12:39.763]  He said, no, this was happening here.
[00:12:40.204 --> 00:12:41.845]  So no doubt it was widespread.
[00:12:41.905 --> 00:12:42.666]  And you go, well, wait a minute.
[00:12:43.646 --> 00:12:47.247]  Cruz won overall, what is it, nine states.
[00:12:48.507 --> 00:12:58.750]  But you see, he narrowly lost Texas, and he narrowly lost other key states, and it's point-shaving because Super Tuesday, none of the states were winner-take-all.
[00:13:02.732 --> 00:13:10.834]  And so by stealing Texas, and I think there's clear evidence this happened, and by stealing other states,
[00:13:12.403 --> 00:13:26.921]  They are then able to come in with a broker convention and have these other candidates, but also their delegates and basically superdelegates, Republicans don't call them that, but they are superdelegates, basically take it completely away from Trump.
[00:13:27.282 --> 00:13:28.543]  And if you don't think they'll do it,
[00:13:29.355 --> 00:13:38.239]  Get ready, because Marco Rubio has been in the news, the Koch brothers have been in the news, the Republican leadership's been in the news, Jeb Bush has been in the news, saying, we'll have a broker convention.
[00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:42.381]  In fact, I saw the crew just putting a Breitbart article up where they're talking about that.
[00:13:42.441 --> 00:13:49.965]  So, sure, you heard about this first six months ago from Richard Reeves, you heard us obsessing on it with different expert guests, but now it's here.
[00:13:50.245 --> 00:13:54.387]  Team Rubio PowerPoint illustrates path to brokered convention.
[00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.751]  That was back in February where they were plotting it and openly talking about it.
[00:14:00.992 --> 00:14:06.234]  Now the answer is a total tsunami for Trump and it's now time to be totally in for Trump.
[00:14:07.975 --> 00:14:08.995]  He may betray us.
[00:14:09.796 --> 00:14:14.918]  This may be a takeover by another hostile group of the North American Union command base.
[00:14:15.598 --> 00:14:19.580]  This could be a coup in the system by another management team.
[00:14:20.566 --> 00:14:28.872]  I'm not that stupid to come out here and tell you that this could be super sophisticated intermural warfare inside the globalist.
[00:14:29.272 --> 00:14:30.113]  I don't believe that.
[00:14:30.393 --> 00:14:31.654]  The signs don't show that.
[00:14:32.054 --> 00:14:33.955]  The entire power structure is freaking out.
[00:14:35.176 --> 00:14:37.138]  Trump is not somebody that's been allied with these groups.
[00:14:37.898 --> 00:14:46.284]  He's allied with, you know, NASCAR owners and architects and designers and more nouveau riche wealthy.
[00:14:49.192 --> 00:14:57.677]  What I'd call the production wealthy, the anti-Cloward and Piven, anti-Gene21, prosperity wealthy.
[00:15:00.539 --> 00:15:02.260]  They're billionaires, but they're not in the club.
[00:15:03.421 --> 00:15:06.023]  They don't control the trillions in banking manipulation.
[00:15:06.043 --> 00:15:12.907]  They're not part of the rigged currency exchanges and the interest rates and the stock markets that they admit are all rigged now.
[00:15:13.428 --> 00:15:16.530]  You've got the super elite that trade in trillions every day
[00:15:17.591 --> 00:15:17.691]  Yeah.
[00:15:38.174 --> 00:15:38.854]  Not a lightweight.
[00:15:38.894 --> 00:15:43.015]  He pretty much did build his money outside the system with a million-dollar loan from his daddy.
[00:15:43.755 --> 00:15:47.616]  He'd already made over a billion dollars by the time his dad died and gave him 200 million.
[00:15:48.276 --> 00:15:52.056]  He'd already eclipsed his father by the time daddy died.
[00:15:55.857 --> 00:15:57.197]  That's old-fashioned family business.
[00:15:57.217 --> 00:15:59.118]  He's got his sons getting ready to run the show as well.
[00:16:00.258 --> 00:16:00.878]  That's what you do.
[00:16:00.918 --> 00:16:07.179]  And then, of course, the son that is the best, works the hardest, ends up getting the seat to run the show.
[00:16:08.524 --> 00:16:09.484]  That's how it's always worked.
[00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.525]  It's only the last 50 years they got rid of that.
[00:16:12.965 --> 00:16:14.585]  So they attack all of this.
[00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:17.266]  This is a true focal point of the revolution.
[00:16:18.426 --> 00:16:23.667]  And even if they destroy Trump, blow up his airplane, shoot him, whatever, they're not going to get rid of him.
[00:16:25.148 --> 00:16:28.749]  And I don't believe he's suddenly going to take a dive because of some scandal for Hillary.
[00:16:29.249 --> 00:16:34.270]  He is damaging them too big on the Federal Reserve, on vaccines, on China telling us what to do.
[00:16:35.908 --> 00:16:42.133]  Trump dumbs it down for people and he says, we make bad deals with foreigners, they have too smart of leaders.
[00:16:43.094 --> 00:16:49.939]  No, the truth is the deals are all meant to screw us because this is global government being established off of the treasure of the West.
[00:16:50.479 --> 00:16:54.402]  I said it earlier, the Communist Chinese government gets 97% of world rare earth minerals.
[00:16:57.947 --> 00:17:04.275]  They get 99%, according to the Wall Street Journal, of Australian rare earth minerals, and about a third of the world's rare earth minerals are in Australia.
[00:17:04.796 --> 00:17:07.319]  Another third or so are in Africa, the rest are spread out.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.144]  The government with regulators will not let a U.S.
[00:17:11.204 --> 00:17:13.728]  company extract rare earth minerals in the United States.
[00:17:16.667 --> 00:17:18.368]  They sit judges, environmentalists on you.
[00:17:18.608 --> 00:17:20.648]  Chinese company comes in, they're allowed to get whatever they want.
[00:17:20.668 --> 00:17:21.508]  You ask, why is that?
[00:17:22.009 --> 00:17:36.733]  Global secret treaties were agreed to in the 70s, they've since come out, part of them, that China gets the deep water ports, they get the Panama Canal, they get a leverage control of world trade in the global deal, shut up with Richard Nixon, the Rockefellers and others.
[00:17:37.053 --> 00:17:39.154]  Nixon tried to pull out of it, that's why they shut him down.
[00:17:41.877 --> 00:17:48.724]  They were given the world economic system, but they were not to control banking, currencies, or military.
[00:17:49.244 --> 00:17:57.252]  That went to the Anglo-American establishment, the United States, Australia, Canada, NATO, the European Union.
[00:17:58.573 --> 00:17:59.914]  China has double-crossed that.
[00:18:00.195 --> 00:18:04.058]  That's why the fleets, three fleets, are off the shore, openly talking about war with China.
[00:18:04.813 --> 00:18:06.775]  Russia threw the oligarchs off.
[00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:08.876]  They're not perfect, but they've got their own system running.
[00:18:09.217 --> 00:18:10.558]  Probably the most moral.
[00:18:11.298 --> 00:18:14.541]  It's the least scientific designing to try to poison and kill families.
[00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:15.482]  It's not eugenic.
[00:18:15.542 --> 00:18:16.122]  It's thug.
[00:18:16.183 --> 00:18:16.703]  It's corrupt.
[00:18:16.743 --> 00:18:17.424]  It's got problems.
[00:18:17.704 --> 00:18:19.846]  But it realizes its very existence is under attack.
[00:18:19.866 --> 00:18:21.067]  So it's saying, have kids.
[00:18:21.127 --> 00:18:22.208]  Don't take the vaccines.
[00:18:22.388 --> 00:18:23.549]  They're putting poison in the water.
[00:18:23.749 --> 00:18:26.111]  Basically, it's Alex Jones 24-7 in Russia right now.
[00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.052]  Alex Jones, Alexander Shultz, and he's a 24-7 in Russia right now.
[00:18:30.352 --> 00:18:36.977]  They're having a renaissance because they've never been out of the dark ages, never out from under oligarchy and royalty, and then the communists.
[00:18:37.457 --> 00:18:39.979]  Russia is having its attempt at 1776.
[00:18:40.239 --> 00:18:43.301]  That's why the globalists are rolling in on every border they've got.
[00:18:44.622 --> 00:18:46.083]  So Russia's the real wild card here.
[00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:50.021]  And this is an insurrection against tyranny.
[00:18:50.662 --> 00:18:52.882]  And again, Trump is only one focal point of that.
[00:18:52.962 --> 00:18:54.963]  And so folks ought to listen to me.
[00:18:55.143 --> 00:18:56.543]  I've proven I know what I'm talking about.
[00:18:56.623 --> 00:18:58.103]  I know how geopolitics works.
[00:18:59.064 --> 00:19:07.366]  Our best shot is to get behind Trump and to watch the polls and be aware of what's happening and have investigators out there checking and have Trump come out.
[00:19:07.406 --> 00:19:08.706]  He doesn't want to sound like a sourpuss.
[00:19:09.738 --> 00:19:17.545]  But he needs to point out that there was major election fraud evidence in many different states and also in early voting in Ohio to prop up Kasich.
[00:19:18.266 --> 00:19:22.870]  And that it's going to take a huge tsunami to get him past 50% of the delegates.
[00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:24.652]  Of course he was winning in a bunch of places.
[00:19:26.293 --> 00:19:27.835]  Almost everyone was voting for Trump.
[00:19:28.395 --> 00:19:30.717]  Democrats in national polls lean more towards Trump.
[00:19:31.098 --> 00:19:35.482]  So why was Cruz and Rubio winning in Austin?
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.821]  Because they shave points.
[00:19:39.562 --> 00:19:41.003]  And they're shaving points everywhere.
[00:19:42.003 --> 00:19:43.845]  So they can go into that convention and steal it.
[00:19:45.006 --> 00:19:45.526]  It's big.
[00:19:45.766 --> 00:19:46.587]  It's out of control.
[00:19:46.747 --> 00:19:49.709]  The Koch brothers are putting 75 mil against him right now.
[00:19:49.929 --> 00:19:51.511]  They now run Rubio's campaign.
[00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:52.992]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:19:53.072 --> 00:19:53.852]  It's a big broadcast.
[00:19:53.872 --> 00:19:54.313]  Stay with us.
[00:19:54.593 --> 00:19:57.335]  The future not as of America, but the world is at stake.
[00:19:57.675 --> 00:19:59.837]  It's humanity against the technocracy.
[00:20:02.262 --> 00:20:03.303]  Attention, citizens.
[00:20:03.503 --> 00:20:09.347]  This man has received national attention for accurately predicting every major financial trend, including the market crash of 2008.
[00:20:09.647 --> 00:20:19.654]  His name is Harry Dent, and in his newly released book, he is making even bigger and bolder predictions that have the potential to devastate the world economy and your personal wealth.

[00:20:35.203 --> 00:20:37.763]  But surviving is not recreation.
[00:20:37.943 --> 00:20:40.463]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[00:22:40.371 --> 00:22:44.134]  And after just two weeks on this product, I'm feeling so much more energy.
[00:22:44.194 --> 00:22:50.159]  My yoga practice has deepened, and as a massage therapist, I'm able to see more clients than I've been able to in years.

[00:24:07.128 --> 00:24:12.292]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:13.673 --> 00:24:26.044]  I'm not going to get into this Ku Klux Klan thing much more, but coming up in the next segment when we have more time, I'm going to play a CNN clip I played last night during our live coverage of Super Tuesday that went on for four hours.
[00:24:29.046 --> 00:24:31.908]  Because it illustrates how they mind control.
[00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:34.931]  They play clips of Trump
[00:24:36.673 --> 00:24:39.355]  Repudiating and saying, I'm not part of the Klan.
[00:24:39.676 --> 00:24:40.617]  Why are you asking me this?
[00:24:40.657 --> 00:24:42.699]  Of course I disavow.
[00:24:43.639 --> 00:24:48.123]  And then they cut to the Southern Poverty Law Center and people going, but he didn't disavow their views.
[00:24:48.143 --> 00:24:49.685]  It's like a weird mind game.
[00:24:49.705 --> 00:24:52.307]  It's like saying, I don't like escargot.
[00:24:52.928 --> 00:24:53.308]  Snails.
[00:24:54.309 --> 00:24:56.031]  And they go, but describe the taste.
[00:24:56.151 --> 00:24:57.052]  Describe the flavor.
[00:24:57.352 --> 00:25:01.456]  Describe why you don't like it and how horrible it is.
[00:25:01.716 --> 00:25:02.717]  I don't like snails!
[00:25:05.333 --> 00:25:07.214]  Then they ask you again, do you like snails?
[00:25:08.455 --> 00:25:09.856]  Why won't you repudiate snails?
[00:25:10.417 --> 00:25:11.818]  Why won't you distance yourself from snails?
[00:25:12.118 --> 00:25:12.939]  Fine, I don't like snails.
[00:25:14.139 --> 00:25:18.563]  And Jesse Ventura came out in defense of Trump because they're kind of the same, old-fashioned, pig-headed.
[00:25:18.583 --> 00:25:24.207]  And he goes, why is it if somebody endorses you, anybody could endorse you, then you've got to go defend it?
[00:25:24.307 --> 00:25:25.007]  It's a free country.
[00:25:25.648 --> 00:25:27.269]  He goes, I wouldn't even respond to this.
[00:25:27.709 --> 00:25:29.671]  And behind the scenes, that's what was going on with Trump.
[00:25:30.387 --> 00:25:31.988]  He goes, I did disavow him 15 years ago.
[00:25:32.148 --> 00:25:33.910]  I disavowed him three or four times last week.
[00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:35.251]  Then they cut my audio off.
[00:25:35.351 --> 00:25:35.872]  I don't hear it.
[00:25:36.132 --> 00:25:36.932]  I say, what groups?
[00:25:37.773 --> 00:25:38.694]  Disavow, disavow.
[00:25:38.914 --> 00:25:42.017]  And then last night, three times in the press conference, three questions.
[00:25:42.537 --> 00:25:43.398]  Will you disavow?
[00:25:43.538 --> 00:25:44.218]  I have disavowed.
[00:25:44.258 --> 00:25:45.019]  I disavow again.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.081]  You're the woman reporter.
[00:25:47.141 --> 00:25:48.122]  I'm, eh, eh, eh.
[00:25:48.142 --> 00:25:49.563]  He goes, lady, I just disavowed.
[00:25:49.603 --> 00:25:49.903]  I'm done.
[00:25:49.923 --> 00:25:52.505]  They go to the next person.
[00:25:53.726 --> 00:25:54.407]  Will you disavow?
[00:25:55.811 --> 00:25:56.471]  Well, who are you, sir?
[00:25:56.591 --> 00:25:57.712]  I'm a Sirius XM.
[00:25:57.792 --> 00:25:58.572]  Okay, I disavow.
[00:25:58.592 --> 00:26:00.173]  Another person, will you disavow?
[00:26:00.493 --> 00:26:01.053]  Now, wait a minute.
[00:26:01.093 --> 00:26:03.434]  I just did this, but you're going to say I didn't disavow.
[00:26:03.454 --> 00:26:03.934]  I disavow.
[00:26:04.374 --> 00:26:06.255]  It's like a weird game these people play.
[00:26:07.995 --> 00:26:09.836]  And it goes on and on.
[00:26:10.196 --> 00:26:15.998]  And I mean, during the weekend and this week, I would hear the news going, he won't disavow on Fox and CNN.
[00:26:16.298 --> 00:26:21.040]  And Paul Ryan comes out yesterday and goes, Donald Trump will not disavow.
[00:26:22.091 --> 00:26:24.012]  You must disavow, Donald.
[00:26:24.352 --> 00:26:25.693]  How dare you?
[00:26:25.933 --> 00:26:27.514]  We are the party of Lincoln!
[00:26:29.815 --> 00:26:35.577]  Running the hoax like the public are idiots, but they know only 20% of people watch news on average.
[00:26:36.758 --> 00:26:40.660]  So it's targeting the people that kind of just get their news from the water cooler.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.001]  Did you hear he wouldn't disavow?
[00:26:43.221 --> 00:26:44.481]  And it was like mind control.
[00:26:44.601 --> 00:26:46.822]  I was looking up stuff going, he didn't disavow?
[00:26:47.323 --> 00:26:50.084]  On Friday and Saturday and Sunday and Monday and Tuesday?
[00:26:51.769 --> 00:26:55.513]  And I just found more than 12 examples of where he disavowed.
[00:26:56.434 --> 00:27:01.239]  And then the new thing is, well, he didn't disavow their views, he just disavowed them.
[00:27:01.259 --> 00:27:04.743]  It's like, do you disavow child molesters?
[00:27:06.445 --> 00:27:07.625]  Yes, I disavow them.
[00:27:07.805 --> 00:27:09.206]  Well, disavow their practices.
[00:27:09.506 --> 00:27:10.526]  Talk about each practice.
[00:27:11.186 --> 00:27:12.546]  I'm not going to talk about those practices.
[00:27:13.126 --> 00:27:13.846]  You're for them.
[00:27:14.206 --> 00:27:17.227]  Jakari Jackson had a great point last night on the Senate coverage.
[00:27:17.667 --> 00:27:22.988]  He said if somebody wears an MSNBC shirt and goes and robs a bank, MSNBC doesn't have to disavow.
[00:27:24.108 --> 00:27:25.349]  But it's worse than that.
[00:27:25.489 --> 00:27:32.630]  Mecha, La Raza, the Blue Black Panther Party, Black Lives Matter, are just as racist or more so in many cases than the KKK.
[00:27:34.938 --> 00:27:39.202]  In fact, I had a caller last Friday when I was going to vote, or maybe it was Thursday, it was Friday.
[00:27:41.144 --> 00:27:43.146]  It was not a caller, it was live-streamed.
[00:27:43.867 --> 00:27:44.667]  It was live-streamed.
[00:27:44.727 --> 00:27:47.070]  I've had callers too on YouTube.
[00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:48.831]  It's Alex Jones Goes on the Road and Votes.
[00:27:48.871 --> 00:27:49.372]  You can see it.
[00:27:49.912 --> 00:27:53.656]  And then the person says, disavow that you don't hate black people.
[00:27:55.297 --> 00:27:56.859]  And I just said, I'm not answering that.
[00:27:58.046 --> 00:28:06.752]  And it's funny, I walk in the grocery store to vote, and there's one of my friends, Cargill, that owns Central Texas Gun Works, and I just give the guy a hug, which I normally do anyways, because he's such a nice guy.
[00:28:06.772 --> 00:28:10.175]  I didn't even realize people in the room were commenting, oh my gosh, look, he's hugging a black guy.
[00:28:10.215 --> 00:28:12.577]  I mean, this is how mind-controlled this is.
[00:28:14.318 --> 00:28:17.100]  And I said, no, I'm not going to say I don't hate black people.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.882]  It's like calling, it's like going, say you don't rape women.
[00:28:19.922 --> 00:28:21.163]  And I'm like, no, I'm not going to do that.
[00:28:22.084 --> 00:28:23.345]  Because I haven't done anything.
[00:28:23.365 --> 00:28:24.446]  So I was saying,
[00:28:26.192 --> 00:28:28.132]  Trump was annoying me not disavowing it more.
[00:28:28.152 --> 00:28:30.133]  He'd already disavowed it four times at that point.
[00:28:31.113 --> 00:28:32.834]  But now I kind of get his point in Ventura.
[00:28:34.234 --> 00:28:38.295]  So now there's this game, though, where he disavows, disavows, disavows, disavows, disavows.
[00:28:38.315 --> 00:28:40.776]  And I'm going to come back and play the clip and then go back to Huckabee.
[00:28:40.816 --> 00:28:45.017]  But this is such a big deal because it shows they know they're trying to deceive people.
[00:28:46.197 --> 00:28:50.478]  And Marco Rubio is calling Donald Trump a con artist.
[00:28:53.359 --> 00:28:54.539]  And now their new meme is
[00:28:55.717 --> 00:29:04.183]  Because he had a real estate school, one of the most successful in the country, and if you go take one of those real estate school deals and you aren't successful, that's your fault.
[00:29:04.883 --> 00:29:05.984]  Or when you got into the market.
[00:29:07.705 --> 00:29:08.986]  It's like if you got a college degree.
[00:29:09.006 --> 00:29:12.268]  90% of the time now it's not going to end up paying off.
[00:29:12.708 --> 00:29:13.849]  Is the whole thing a con game?
[00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:17.912]  It's 10 times the con game of Donald Trump's real estate stuff.
[00:29:18.935 --> 00:29:28.781]  You can go take computer courses, RTF courses at little mom and pop schools that have like a hundred students, in my experience, people I know, and get more training and better jobs.
[00:29:28.861 --> 00:29:34.665]  I know people that went and took weekend courses in web mastering 20 years ago that are making a million dollars a year today.
[00:29:35.945 --> 00:29:41.369]  I mean, in my experience, technical schools and stuff like that, or just becoming an apprentice are much better.
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.382]  Again, they're the con artist saying he's the con artist.
[00:29:46.042 --> 00:29:49.064]  When he's ever been involved in politics, it's amazing.
[00:29:49.645 --> 00:29:51.546]  It's incredible, the demonization tactics.
[00:29:51.566 --> 00:29:52.266]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.286 --> 00:29:52.967]  It's not working anymore.
[00:29:52.987 --> 00:29:54.468]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.368 --> 00:29:58.070]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.797 --> 00:30:10.943]  The British government is pushing the Investigory Powers Bill, or Snoopers Charter, that will effectively end internet privacy.
[00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:25.675]  The proposed legislation targets popular chat and message services such as WhatsApp, iMessage, and FaceTime, outlaws end-to-end encryption, and will force Apple to rewrite its iOS from the ground up to accommodate surveillance by the state.
[00:30:25.875 --> 00:30:30.139]  It would also force tech companies to provide back doors accessible to government.
[00:30:30.419 --> 00:30:36.164]  Additionally, the law requires ISPs to keep records of all internet activity of its customers.
[00:30:36.445 --> 00:30:40.288]  The data would be available to the government for a year.
[00:30:40.408 --> 00:30:51.438]  In 2015, the British Home Secretary, Theresa May, admitted that a 1983 telecom act permitted bulk retention of data by MI5, and the agency has done so since September 2001.
[00:30:52.739 --> 00:30:56.683]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:31:03.431 --> 00:31:06.852]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:31:07.192 --> 00:31:14.335]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:31:14.935 --> 00:31:23.298]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:31:23.558 --> 00:31:27.640]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.161]  Pathenogens added to the food and water.
[00:31:30.401 --> 00:31:37.383]  ...into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:31:37.803 --> 00:31:40.943]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.

[00:33:05.333 --> 00:33:11.658]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.802]  We can see for miles and miles.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.541]  Here's an example of how we see for miles and miles.
[00:33:32.621 --> 00:33:34.501]  We just actually read the trade publications.
[00:33:36.421 --> 00:33:41.803]  It was about 18 years ago that I began to show trade publications on my local TV show and talk about it on the radio.
[00:33:44.043 --> 00:33:51.705]  Where the federal government and local governments through threat fusion centers that existed before 9-11, by the way, they just rolled them out then to the public.
[00:33:52.892 --> 00:33:55.174]  McClinton's called it Homeland Security back in 1995.
[00:33:56.496 --> 00:34:03.403]  That was the secret name for it run by Northcom before Northcom was even officially established at Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[00:34:05.064 --> 00:34:12.692]  That they were putting in what they called gunshot detectors all over the country that were really microphones that could listen to you at upwards of 250 yards away.
[00:34:12.712 --> 00:34:16.336]  And they were run through NSA keyword software.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:23.602]  Then we learned it was the cable boxes that were rolling out in the mid-90s also had the microphones in them.
[00:34:26.463 --> 00:34:30.785]  By the time they tell you about it, it's for voice command, but the real use is to listen to you.
[00:34:32.766 --> 00:34:35.107]  And we talked five years ago about Intellistreets.
[00:34:36.227 --> 00:34:42.990]  In Chicago and other cities, billions being spent for smart streetlights
[00:34:44.377 --> 00:34:52.262]  That have cameras and microphones and cell tower stingray type technology to steal all your data and break your passcodes.
[00:34:54.124 --> 00:34:58.527]  We also told you Google cars were driving around, grabbing all your data.
[00:34:59.868 --> 00:35:01.729]  Well, here it is, DrudgeReport.com.
[00:35:02.429 --> 00:35:05.571]  Devices on public buses listening to private conversations.
[00:35:07.172 --> 00:35:09.374]  Clear channel billboards read you.
[00:35:10.074 --> 00:35:13.397]  School monitors students' social media to head off problems.
[00:35:14.585 --> 00:35:16.326]  Police push for armed drones.
[00:35:18.567 --> 00:35:24.150]  And by the way, that's the New York Times on the billboard scanning you and reading you and spying on you.
[00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:28.392]  And it's the Washington Post on the microphones on the buses.
[00:35:28.692 --> 00:35:30.273]  It's also cameras, boys and girls.
[00:35:32.274 --> 00:35:39.538]  So see, my problem is I was just aware of all this 20 years before the general public.
[00:35:40.885 --> 00:35:54.409]  And so I get up here and I go, Davos Forum has just released an announcement that they want a 100 trillion global tax, and when the world economy collapses in the next decade, they want a strategic drawing right that all of their currencies are based on.
[00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:01.692]  Then they have the news come out and say, Jones says next year the dollar will be abolished and we'll have something called the Amero.
[00:36:02.292 --> 00:36:02.812]  Never said it.
[00:36:03.812 --> 00:36:07.173]  That was a concept coin that was put out, but everybody freaked out about that.
[00:36:07.394 --> 00:36:08.454]  No, you'll still have a dollar.
[00:36:10.247 --> 00:36:13.430]  But it will be SHET to the global currency.
[00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:15.851]  And then they're gonna phase that cash out.
[00:36:17.132 --> 00:36:21.136]  You still have a credit card with an American flag on it, that'll be your National ID card, but it'll be global.
[00:36:23.117 --> 00:36:23.878]  How did I know this?
[00:36:23.958 --> 00:36:24.719]  Because I read
[00:36:25.851 --> 00:36:32.454]  The big telecom consortium minutes that were public for meetings in Tokyo and Chicago and New York and Sydney.
[00:36:32.915 --> 00:36:45.481]  And I had all the experts on and they talked about how they would control the future and track everything in real time and have smart dust on every item in the world by law integrated into the structure of it so you can't remove it.
[00:36:47.362 --> 00:36:53.405]  And how they would genetically engineer every plant and animal and splice humans with animals and they're doing it all, okay?
[00:36:55.657 --> 00:37:00.640]  And I'm not here saying, wow, I was so right, wow, I'm so cool, wow, listen to me.
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:06.503]  I am here.
[00:37:11.085 --> 00:37:15.968]  Just worried about my family and your family, and I know for a fact I'm right because the enemy's public.
[00:37:16.788 --> 00:37:22.251]  And I'm just telling you a declared operation, like the Borg, arriving on Earth.
[00:37:23.561 --> 00:37:30.164]  And you see these allegories with the Borg and with movies like Oblivion.
[00:37:34.226 --> 00:37:45.771]  And the allegory fits because what the elite are building... Imagine writing a science fiction book where there is a race of aliens in a higher dimension or a lower dimension.
[00:37:46.772 --> 00:37:48.914]  And this is an allegory before the New York Times runs with this.
[00:37:49.574 --> 00:37:58.321]  And they interdimensionally are giving certain humans dark knowledge on how to build a grid control system that's a Trojan horse and looks like it makes life easier.
[00:37:58.661 --> 00:38:16.515]  But once you adopt it, you give your consciousness up to it and then lose your humanity in the process and basically then decide you're a bad species and agree that you want to be assimilated and overwritten and merged with a machine and then lose your physical body.
[00:38:18.339 --> 00:38:28.745]  Now that's the promise of the globalists and their public plan, from Google to Ray Kurzweil to HG Wells to all of them.
[00:38:30.866 --> 00:38:46.475]  That's why you see what I'm saying in Arthur C. Clarke, MI6 agent, OSS before that, inventor of the telecommunications satellite, high-level Illuminati, 2001 Space Odyssey, childlike allegory if you'd understand what's going to happen.
[00:38:52.799 --> 00:38:55.282]  They are bringing in the end of humanity.
[00:38:58.186 --> 00:39:03.813]  And they are building at the highest levels of the Bavarian Illuminati.
[00:39:04.334 --> 00:39:07.518]  When you study them, they believe they are channeling interdimensional beings.
[00:39:07.939 --> 00:39:08.460]  This is not me!
[00:39:10.029 --> 00:39:15.391]  This is them, and they're giving them advanced technology and information to control this third dimension.
[00:39:16.031 --> 00:39:20.893]  And their orders are, build this technocracy, wipe out humanity, and they're going to be gods.
[00:39:21.533 --> 00:39:23.814]  And you're saying, wait a minute, that's childhood's end.
[00:39:24.494 --> 00:39:27.175]  Wait a minute, that's all these science fiction movies and this culture.
[00:39:27.435 --> 00:39:28.575]  We see themes of this.
[00:39:28.635 --> 00:39:30.476]  Not the full theme, but themes of it.
[00:39:31.016 --> 00:39:34.157]  And it's because that's what the global elite believe.
[00:39:39.366 --> 00:39:41.787]  Now, Christians would say, yeah, that's the devil doing that.
[00:39:42.648 --> 00:39:44.029]  And that's the Antichrist Peace System.
[00:39:45.129 --> 00:39:45.329]  See?
[00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:46.510]  There it is again in the Bible.
[00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:48.791]  And it's in the Vedic text with the Indians.
[00:39:49.272 --> 00:39:53.954]  And it's in every ancient religion and culture from the Dogon tribe in Africa right through.
[00:39:55.215 --> 00:39:58.457]  Now, I don't know exactly what's going on, because I deal with what I can prove.
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:05.881]  But that's the big enchilada.
[00:40:08.263 --> 00:40:11.344]  And they're building a system that is human-ending.
[00:40:13.845 --> 00:40:15.586]  I was watching Fox News this morning.
[00:40:18.967 --> 00:40:21.308]  And Megyn Kelly is morphing into an asexual creature.
[00:40:21.868 --> 00:40:25.189]  The ads were all dads doing the mopping and dads doing the cooking.
[00:40:25.389 --> 00:40:26.469]  And it'd be okay if there was some of that.
[00:40:26.529 --> 00:40:28.450]  That's the only message I saw during the ads.
[00:40:29.931 --> 00:40:31.951]  And of course, I already knew that, but it's just, wow!
[00:40:32.452 --> 00:40:33.472]  I had the audio off.
[00:40:38.052 --> 00:40:41.193]  And I was just looking at the closed captioning and it was just total conditioning.
[00:40:41.653 --> 00:40:48.095]  What Orwell failed to predict is that we buy the cameras ourselves and then our biggest fear would be that nobody was watching.
[00:40:48.996 --> 00:40:50.916]  That's Keith Lowell Jensen said that.
[00:40:52.297 --> 00:40:53.237]  That's a very good quote.
[00:40:54.217 --> 00:41:00.319]  And so they weren't ready for you to know 20 years ago when I told you about the microphones in your appliances.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:05.721]  You weren't ready in their rollout to know that the street lamps are listening to you and watching you.
[00:41:06.857 --> 00:41:15.179]  And that computers decide when something is suspicious and tell the police, and so they claim, oh, well, I had reasonable suspicion.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:27.163]  And you could argue of loving angels, if the archangel Gabriel or Michael was running these, you could say, oh, well, it's okay.
[00:41:28.814 --> 00:41:30.615]  There's always an excuse, it's for the greater good.
[00:41:30.715 --> 00:41:33.296]  No, the good guys don't run this.
[00:41:33.997 --> 00:41:38.979]  And just look at the cancer rates, the IQs dropping, the culture falling apart, the family falling apart.
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:43.522]  This thing we're being fed into doesn't lead to a nice place.
[00:41:44.202 --> 00:41:46.423]  You smell what's down that dark hole?
[00:41:46.703 --> 00:41:47.304]  Let me tell you.
[00:41:47.904 --> 00:41:51.787]  They're like, hey, doesn't matter, put your virtual reality goggles on and march down this path.
[00:41:51.847 --> 00:41:52.588]  It's really pretty.
[00:41:52.888 --> 00:42:01.035]  That's why they want you in the Matrix with the goggles on, looking at your smartphone and watching American Idol and the Oscars and marching to hell.
[00:42:01.435 --> 00:42:05.958]  They don't want you actually looking around you and using your instincts, using your gut, using your common sense.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:16.267]  So whether it's interdimensional spirits, whether it's classical third dimensional deep space aliens,
[00:42:18.257 --> 00:42:28.283]  Or whether it's psychotic elites throughout history that have envisioned systems of total control and humans are so powerful they've been able to manifest it by stealing our dreams.
[00:42:28.643 --> 00:42:30.044]  They manipulate us to build for them.
[00:42:32.906 --> 00:42:40.030]  Or whether the elite have grabbed onto ancient cosmologies and are deceived and believe that they're just ripping off a narrative but it sounds like a good control system.
[00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:41.571]  Whatever it is,
[00:42:44.022 --> 00:42:46.764]  Let's just say it's scientific and it's out of the mind of humans.
[00:42:47.285 --> 00:42:47.845]  It doesn't matter.
[00:42:47.906 --> 00:42:52.029]  They're building alien systems.
[00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:54.972]  They're creating alien creatures.
[00:42:57.214 --> 00:43:02.859]  Human embryos growing in goats, in sheep, in pigs, in cows.
[00:43:05.962 --> 00:43:07.864]  For 20 years that I know about it.
[00:43:08.638 --> 00:43:14.141]  And when the BBC reported on it 20 years ago, I'd already read it in some trade publications, they said it had been going on for 10.
[00:43:15.321 --> 00:43:19.863]  That's 30 years.
[00:43:22.024 --> 00:43:24.366]  And now they're telling you about it this year.
[00:43:25.966 --> 00:43:26.407]  30 years later.
[00:43:26.727 --> 00:43:30.569]  Now they're telling you about microphones in the light poles and cameras.
[00:43:32.209 --> 00:43:33.410]  20 years plus after.
[00:43:36.578 --> 00:43:39.340]  They're going, guess what, those aren't gunshot detectors, they're listening to you.
[00:43:42.862 --> 00:43:44.663]  And see, in legalese, they're telling the truth.
[00:43:44.783 --> 00:43:57.030]  It is a gunshot detector, it does pick up shots fired, it does triangulate, but it's really, it's base use is a microphone, just like your so-called smartphone, with a great camera, and all these amazing games, and all the things it does, and calculators.
[00:44:00.472 --> 00:44:01.393]  You seen this before?
[00:44:04.682 --> 00:44:05.463]  Seen this before?
[00:44:05.483 --> 00:44:07.004]  Where have you seen that shape?
[00:44:09.125 --> 00:44:11.486]  Guys, type in 2001 Space Odyssey into Google.
[00:44:13.788 --> 00:44:20.732]  Pull up opening scene when they wake up in the morning and... It's standing there.
[00:44:21.453 --> 00:44:26.096]  And it sends out a signal activating their DNA to evolve.
[00:44:27.332 --> 00:44:28.672]  I'm holding up a iPhone.
[00:44:29.372 --> 00:44:30.353]  A smart phone.
[00:44:30.773 --> 00:44:32.593]  It makes you smart, but it really makes you dumb.
[00:44:33.073 --> 00:44:36.574]  Oh, and as if that didn't tell you enough what was going on, what is the obelisk?
[00:44:37.914 --> 00:44:41.435]  It's the apple in the garden that a bike's been taken out of.
[00:44:44.075 --> 00:44:44.715]  It's the mark.
[00:44:52.657 --> 00:44:56.198]  Now again, we should probably come back with the 2001 music.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.241]  What is the obelisk?
[00:45:00.341 --> 00:45:01.302]  What is the obelisk?
[00:45:01.902 --> 00:45:03.042]  You're about to get the big secret.
[00:45:03.082 --> 00:45:05.764]  I didn't need to get this from Vivian Kubrick, his protégé, his daughter.
[00:45:05.784 --> 00:45:07.725]  I already knew it when I told her.
[00:45:07.745 --> 00:45:09.005]  She said no one else knew that.
[00:45:10.046 --> 00:45:14.928]  The obelisk, you see, is the modern TV screen.
[00:45:15.888 --> 00:45:17.069]  It's the final ratio.
[00:45:19.341 --> 00:45:29.686]  It is the interdimensional gate through which the programming flows, which you will then be inserted into with a virtual reality and wires directly into your cerebral cortex, and it's game over.
[00:45:30.807 --> 00:45:34.288]  It is the cheese on the trap.
[00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:39.731]  And it sends out the signal.
[00:45:42.225 --> 00:45:49.027]  A signal so strong that when they dig up the next one on the moon, it kills the astronauts when it activates.
[00:45:49.528 --> 00:45:50.368]  And what's that metaphor?
[00:45:50.828 --> 00:45:51.568]  What's that message?
[00:45:52.149 --> 00:45:55.190]  This next transcendent level, men die.
[00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:57.030]  The end of age of men.
[00:45:57.631 --> 00:46:09.515]  Only the uber-man on the ship, the chosen one, the two top males, blasting into space, going out to Jupiter, Saturn in the book, to ignite the new sun, Lucifer.
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:16.061]  But first they have to battle the AI that took him to that level and transcended.
[00:46:16.261 --> 00:46:30.443]  Then he has to give up his humanity and warp to another dimension to be reincarnated as the star child to return and repopulate the Earth that has been depopulated.
[00:46:31.684 --> 00:46:33.204]  The return of Lucifer.
[00:46:35.724 --> 00:46:38.385]  Fiery the angels fell, dark
[00:46:39.597 --> 00:46:44.441]  Thunder rolled around their shores, burning with the fires of Ork.
[00:46:45.942 --> 00:46:50.526]  You want the secrets, I'm giving them to you.
[00:46:50.846 --> 00:46:51.647]  2001 Space Odyssey.
[00:46:52.408 --> 00:46:53.268]  The Obelisk.
[00:46:55.971 --> 00:46:59.854]  First it evolves you, then it kills you.
[00:47:09.635 --> 00:47:11.337]  The grey screen of a television.
[00:47:13.918 --> 00:47:14.459]  The gate.
[00:47:16.961 --> 00:47:17.821]  The technology.
[00:47:20.704 --> 00:47:22.625]  But only one of them at first is willing to touch it.
[00:47:23.345 --> 00:47:25.007]  Of course, he then takes up the sword.
[00:47:28.429 --> 00:47:29.430]  War is born.
[00:47:31.572 --> 00:47:32.993]  Death comes into the world.
[00:47:33.013 --> 00:47:35.875]  But not a physical death.
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.321]  The knowledge of evil is now available.
[00:47:41.261 --> 00:47:43.962]  The knowledge of another dimension is now at your hands.
[00:47:44.943 --> 00:47:47.723]  The apple from the obelisk.
[00:47:51.445 --> 00:47:52.505]  This is your God.
[00:47:54.486 --> 00:47:58.487]  And they say that Apple for a dollar or two more could sell these and not use Chinese slave labor.
[00:47:59.187 --> 00:48:01.528]  And they've got big reports on it and empower all those people.
[00:48:02.591 --> 00:48:03.672]  They don't want to empower them.
[00:48:04.332 --> 00:48:10.815]  The building of this machine is to destroy us here in the West, and of course, enslave and poison and kill those that built it.
[00:48:11.195 --> 00:48:12.596]  They're just deeper in the clutches.
[00:48:15.257 --> 00:48:16.838]  Good could not come of this!
[00:48:16.938 --> 00:48:20.140]  It is an instrument of evil, like the Ring of Sauron!
[00:48:24.562 --> 00:48:26.203]  The Ring of Power.
[00:48:27.984 --> 00:48:29.705]  The Fire of the Gods.
[00:48:31.553 --> 00:48:33.734]  Oh, we were talking about Donald Trump and the KKK.
[00:48:34.494 --> 00:48:35.154]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:48:35.194 --> 00:48:40.856]  I'm sorry I don't want to fight with the black people or anybody else while we're under absolute demonic takeover.
[00:48:41.576 --> 00:48:42.096]  I'm sorry.
[00:48:42.976 --> 00:48:45.577]  Let's get back to the NFL, should we?
[00:48:46.537 --> 00:48:49.498]  I'm going to go to break, though, and come back with this CNN piece because it shows the deception.
[00:48:49.618 --> 00:48:50.739]  Oh, he did the disavowal.
[00:48:50.779 --> 00:48:52.719]  A bunch of people now found out that they were lying.
[00:48:53.239 --> 00:48:54.700]  So, but he didn't disavow it properly.
[00:48:56.016 --> 00:48:59.677]  And then the fact of what Huckabee had to say in your phone calls and a lot more today.
[00:48:59.697 --> 00:49:01.097]  I'm gonna put the phones up at the second hour.
[00:49:02.358 --> 00:49:05.698]  Briefly, here, we had the big special.
[00:49:05.978 --> 00:49:06.679]  It is over now.
[00:49:06.699 --> 00:49:09.719]  And we did sell out of a lot of items, but we held some back.
[00:49:10.579 --> 00:49:12.700]  And you get 10% off when you sign up for AutoShip.
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:25.023]  So the way you can get the items that did sell out, like Super Male Vitality that just came back in, Super Female Vitality, Secret 12, DNA Force, and Living Defense and others, is sign up and get 10% off at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:49:27.888 --> 00:49:29.961]  Or in 4store.com, the big umbrella site.
[00:49:32.532 --> 00:49:38.477]  Also, we have a flash sale just running through the end of the week.
[00:49:38.497 --> 00:49:42.701]  50% off colloidal silver, silver bullet, highest quality, 30 parts per million.
[00:49:43.141 --> 00:49:44.062]  That's caged to be the best.
[00:49:44.102 --> 00:49:47.184]  You can make it more parts per million, folks, but then it could become toxic in our research.
[00:49:47.625 --> 00:49:48.706]  That's what most experts agree.
[00:49:48.726 --> 00:49:50.627]  This is very high power.
[00:49:50.667 --> 00:49:54.250]  Consult your physician before you use it, but with antibiotics and stuff, not working anymore.
[00:49:54.571 --> 00:49:56.492]  Everybody's, you know, investigating well-known stuff.
[00:49:56.813 --> 00:49:58.134]  So, Infowarslife.com, 50% off.
[00:49:59.815 --> 00:50:03.677]  For a limited time, it's silver bullet colloidal silver for an unprecedented 50% off.

[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.862]  And we've already sold out of several products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:50:16.102 --> 00:50:16.402]  I think so.
[00:50:36.152 --> 00:50:41.857]  Anthroplex is simply an amazing, well just go read about it, it's super male vitality, has some other ingredients as well.
[00:50:42.258 --> 00:50:44.200]  Super male is better in some ways, this is better in others.
[00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:46.882]  It just goes together, they're meant to be stacked together.
[00:50:47.342 --> 00:50:49.564]  It's the foundation to use super female or super male.
[00:50:50.045 --> 00:50:52.607]  Anthroplex, available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:50:53.028 --> 00:50:59.594]  And your funding of this operation, whether it's a Hillary for President t-shirt or whatever the case may be, funds a pro-human organization.

[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.141]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:52:34.462 --> 00:52:37.063]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:52:37.083 --> 00:52:37.503]  Croix River.
[00:52:37.823 --> 00:52:39.824]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:52:40.064 --> 00:52:42.786]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:52:43.026 --> 00:52:43.546]  His excuse?
[00:52:43.906 --> 00:52:44.967]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:52:45.227 --> 00:52:46.528]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:52:46.848 --> 00:52:52.331]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[00:54:13.362 --> 00:54:17.405]  This is what you want, this is what you get.
[00:54:17.425 --> 00:54:19.887]  Trump's come out and said Chris Christie would make a great Attorney General.
[00:54:19.907 --> 00:54:23.829]  I know for a fact he's told Judge Napolitano to his face.
[00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:26.191]  He's looking at him for Supreme Court justice.
[00:54:31.735 --> 00:54:38.179]  If you're a radio listener, look at an iPhone, a smartphone, and notice when you upturn it, it's the obelisk from 2001 Space Odyssey.
[00:54:38.259 --> 00:54:40.821]  It's a TV screen ratio.
[00:54:42.694 --> 00:54:48.277]  Today, but at that time, the ratio of 35mm or 80mm film screens.
[00:54:51.218 --> 00:54:57.341]  And so it's art, it's literature, it's culture, it's ideas, it's other realities, it's other dimensions, it's what it sucks you into.
[00:54:59.022 --> 00:55:01.563]  A tool for good, but also a great tool for bad.
[00:55:04.044 --> 00:55:08.386]  And now they've had the revelation of the method, what their plans are for humanity are writ large.
[00:55:09.367 --> 00:55:09.827]  Coming up,
[00:55:11.035 --> 00:55:12.256]  You're dividing people by race.
[00:55:12.396 --> 00:55:17.439]  CNN's Jeff Lord, Van Jones, blow up over Trump KKK flap.
[00:55:18.799 --> 00:55:21.481]  And Van Jones just keeps saying, you know, he hasn't denied it.
[00:55:21.981 --> 00:55:22.822]  He hasn't disavowed it.
[00:55:22.842 --> 00:55:23.402]  He goes, yes, he has.
[00:55:24.082 --> 00:55:32.407]  And then he starts talking about black people in context as if only they matter.
[00:55:36.175 --> 00:55:39.197]  The other pundit just says, look, you're the one bringing up race.
[00:55:39.277 --> 00:55:40.338]  You're the one injecting it.
[00:55:40.858 --> 00:55:44.840]  And see, that's the big elephant in the room, is that they're the ones invoking all this.
[00:55:47.482 --> 00:55:50.364]  Just like if you read Obamacare and it had death panels.
[00:55:51.354 --> 00:55:56.676]  And it had doubling and tripling of prices written by foreign insurance companies and rationing of care.
[00:55:56.916 --> 00:55:58.277]  They would just go, no, it doesn't racist.
[00:55:58.757 --> 00:56:00.157]  Alex Jones is deeply racist.
[00:56:00.177 --> 00:56:02.198]  He doesn't like the fact that Obama's black.
[00:56:02.258 --> 00:56:04.299]  That's an actual quote on MSNBC.
[00:56:04.799 --> 00:56:05.759]  He doesn't like it.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:08.200]  And that's why he's saying it's got death panels.
[00:56:08.881 --> 00:56:10.741]  No, it's because we read the subsections on air.
[00:56:11.582 --> 00:56:13.182]  They'd get on air and go, there are no fines.
[00:56:13.322 --> 00:56:13.982]  It's all lies.
[00:56:14.002 --> 00:56:15.283]  Of course, now the fines are going out.
[00:56:18.035 --> 00:56:18.976]  This is the deception.
[00:56:19.016 --> 00:56:19.696]  It's so crazy.
[00:56:20.056 --> 00:56:29.583]  But there was a powerful piece on CNN, powerfully deceptive, where they finally have to admit that Trump's been disavowing before the earpiece even cut out.
[00:56:30.244 --> 00:56:32.665]  But then they say, but he's not disavowing properly.
[00:56:34.126 --> 00:56:39.530]  You see, he has to disavow what the Klan says and does, and I guess give a five-hour speech about it.
[00:56:41.151 --> 00:56:42.092]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[00:56:44.016 --> 00:56:50.021]  Some white supremacists, such as former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke, may suggest support for Donald Trump.
[00:56:50.141 --> 00:56:54.044]  Running against Donald Trump at this point is really treason to your heritage.
[00:56:54.224 --> 00:56:57.227]  But after a weekend of back and forth... I disavow, okay?
[00:56:57.587 --> 00:57:00.049]  I don't know anything about David Duke, okay?
[00:57:00.209 --> 00:57:04.753]  We still don't know if the Republican frontrunner wholly rejects the controversial support.
[00:57:05.033 --> 00:57:08.696]  It's a question Trump has been struggling to answer clearly for months.
[00:57:08.716 --> 00:57:09.837]  What I heard was very
[00:57:10.302 --> 00:57:10.662]  Back it up.
[00:57:11.343 --> 00:57:14.087]  He disavowed it 15 years ago when he joined the Reform Party.
[00:57:14.247 --> 00:57:15.228]  Trump got out of it on his own.
[00:57:15.649 --> 00:57:17.511]  He disavowed it three or four times before that.
[00:57:17.932 --> 00:57:19.754]  Then they cut the deal and he said, who are you talking about?
[00:57:20.535 --> 00:57:23.058]  Then they kept doing it and they said, we don't know if he fully disavows.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:25.221]  See how the mind game works?
[00:57:25.261 --> 00:57:25.562]  Here it is.
[00:57:27.213 --> 00:57:31.717]  We still don't know if the Republican frontrunner wholly rejects the controversial support.
[00:57:32.038 --> 00:57:35.301]  It's a question Trump has been struggling to answer clearly for months.
[00:57:35.701 --> 00:57:42.107]  What I heard was various groups, and I don't mind disavowing anybody, and I disavowed David Duke.
[00:57:42.307 --> 00:57:44.109]  Yes, he has disavowed Duke.
[00:57:44.569 --> 00:57:51.693]  But the Republican frontrunner has yet to plainly condemn Duke's ideology, or that of the KKK and other white supremacist groups.
[00:57:52.093 --> 00:57:56.476]  The Anti-Defamation League has called for Trump to do just that, to no avail.
[00:57:56.696 --> 00:58:05.121]  Not answering this question directly has some risks, but I think it has more rewards, which is that he is hoping to just- Carl, stop right there.
[00:58:06.857 --> 00:58:08.739]  Again, it's about they set the parameters.
[00:58:08.819 --> 00:58:09.879]  We say what you say.
[00:58:09.899 --> 00:58:10.900]  We say what you do.
[00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:12.321]  We say what words you can use.
[00:58:12.842 --> 00:58:14.403]  You must disavow the way we say.
[00:58:14.643 --> 00:58:15.604]  We're high and mighty.
[00:58:15.624 --> 00:58:16.645]  And you're like, oh, these are idiots.
[00:58:16.705 --> 00:58:17.045]  Ignore them.
[00:58:17.185 --> 00:58:18.046]  They got your kids.
[00:58:18.666 --> 00:58:22.570]  In the public schools, in the private schools, most of them, follow this political correctness.
[00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:23.650]  And in the colleges.
[00:58:24.511 --> 00:58:35.175]  And they're in there bullying the daylights out of them, banning costume parties, banning brown paper bags, banning the word lynch off buildings, running around foaming at the mouth, getting people fired.
[00:58:35.715 --> 00:58:42.598]  They're a bunch of control freak terrorists that want to break our will and want to hold us captive and they want to put people in forced labor camps.
[00:58:42.938 --> 00:58:44.018]  It's what leftists always do.
[00:58:44.058 --> 00:58:46.679]  These people are so dangerous.
[00:58:47.399 --> 00:58:48.600]  They are the scourge.
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:51.321]  They're as dangerous as the Nazis were in Germany.
[00:58:51.946 --> 00:58:52.807]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:58:52.867 --> 00:58:53.267]  Good, brother.
[00:58:53.427 --> 00:58:55.149]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:58:55.389 --> 00:58:56.931]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:58:57.111 --> 00:59:01.134]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:59:01.154 --> 00:59:03.717]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:59:03.757 --> 00:59:06.019]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:59:06.179 --> 00:59:14.146]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:59:14.246 --> 00:59:17.450]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:19.092]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:59:19.112 --> 00:59:23.537]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[00:59:23.818 --> 00:59:29.224]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[00:59:29.224 --> 00:59:30.685]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:18.555]  We are on the march.
[01:00:18.935 --> 01:00:21.301]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:00:22.123 --> 01:00:24.929]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:31.519 --> 01:00:34.100]  We are live broadcasting worldwide into the second hour.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.501]  What did you think of Super Tuesday?
[01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:39.142]  What did you think of clear evidence coming in around the country?
[01:00:39.162 --> 01:00:45.365]  Votes weren't flipping from Rubio or Cruz all over the country, not just Texas, but all over Super Tuesday states.
[01:00:45.765 --> 01:00:46.465]  The reports came in.
[01:00:46.485 --> 01:00:51.187]  They weren't flipping from Cruz or Rubio to Trump.
[01:00:51.207 --> 01:00:52.068]  It was the other way around.
[01:00:52.168 --> 01:00:53.848]  And it was massive in Austin.
[01:00:54.409 --> 01:00:56.690]  Election judges talked about it to our reporters.
[01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:59.491]  Reporters talked about it, who talked to scores of people.
[01:01:00.691 --> 01:01:07.781]  I'm going to play some of those reports from Jakari Jackson and of course Joe Biggs and others coming up.
[01:01:07.801 --> 01:01:09.443]  But I want to take your calls on this.
[01:01:09.483 --> 01:01:12.007]  Were you specifically a witness to any fraud?
[01:01:13.028 --> 01:01:15.752]  Did your vote get flipped from Cruz?
[01:01:17.219 --> 01:01:17.719]  To Trump?
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.401]  I mean, maybe that happened to somebody out there.
[01:01:19.441 --> 01:01:20.781]  We haven't heard that yet.
[01:01:22.022 --> 01:01:26.005]  Do you get my point that he needs to get half the delegates or more to not be challenged at the convention?
[01:01:26.485 --> 01:01:29.647]  And they've got 365 and he's got 316 so far?
[01:01:30.008 --> 01:01:30.888]  You see the strategy?
[01:01:32.349 --> 01:01:34.611]  And they admit the strategy to try to have a broker convention.
[01:01:34.671 --> 01:01:36.872]  But to do that, they gotta fight dirty.
[01:01:38.053 --> 01:01:39.334]  That's why they're staying in till the end.
[01:01:39.394 --> 01:01:40.174]  Roger Stone's right.
[01:01:40.194 --> 01:01:43.296]  They're not backing off like they did with Reagan after he swept Super Tuesday.
[01:01:43.317 --> 01:01:44.657]  They're going all the way to the convention.
[01:01:44.878 --> 01:01:45.798]  How do you counter that?
[01:01:45.898 --> 01:01:46.819]  What's your view on that?
[01:01:47.998 --> 01:01:51.340]  First-time callers or people that experience this specifically.
[01:01:51.361 --> 01:01:52.121]  800-259-9231.
[01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:52.521]  800-259-9231.
[01:01:52.541 --> 01:02:05.611]  And I know I tend to not go to calls sometimes and that discourages good callers, but today I'm going to be going right to your calls at the start of the next segment.
[01:02:05.631 --> 01:02:05.671]  800-259-9231.
[01:02:10.175 --> 01:02:19.637]  I want to play this Huckabee clip again because it's such a big deal, but I'm going to do that after the break so that we have time to get to it, where he says that this is a overthrow, a peaceful overthrow of the government.
[01:02:19.957 --> 01:02:21.337]  That's what elections are every cycle.
[01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:26.939]  But the people are getting behind Trump because he's seen as not playing ball.
[01:02:27.519 --> 01:02:33.320]  I mean, I know a lot of people that are holding their nose on the spying and the torture and stuff that he's trying to sound tough on.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.300]  I disagree with big time.
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.241]  Some of his eminent domain stuff's over the line.
[01:02:40.026 --> 01:02:45.391]  But he'll fight the TPP and the world government taking all of our land in giant secret deals.
[01:02:45.411 --> 01:02:47.833]  You know, he's fighting the real fraud that's going on.
[01:02:48.213 --> 01:02:54.719]  The point is, he's a sovereign nationalist person and the elite are panicking.
[01:02:54.739 --> 01:03:02.805]  Larry Summers has come out, top globalist, one of the top ten, and said Trump is a serious threat to American democracy when they're the people taking our country over.
[01:03:02.825 --> 01:03:02.865]  800-259-9231.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.922]  I mentioned this earlier, but I didn't plug it very, very long, so I'm going to say this a couple times this hour because it's so important.
[01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:14.683]  Your purchase of products funds everything we do here.
[01:03:14.963 --> 01:03:17.124]  You see us growing in the face of this depression.
[01:03:17.424 --> 01:03:20.466]  That's not easy to do, but the audience is exploding, so we're able to do it.
[01:03:20.546 --> 01:03:21.626]  Thank you for your support.
[01:03:21.946 --> 01:03:23.587]  Thank you for spreading the word about the broadcast.
[01:03:23.847 --> 01:03:26.388]  Thank you for calling affiliates and thanking them for carrying the show.
[01:03:26.728 --> 01:03:31.390]  Thanks for calling local stations in your area if you don't have an affiliate and tell them to pick up the Alex Jones Show.
[01:03:33.971 --> 01:03:34.892]  No army can stop...
[01:03:36.519 --> 01:03:39.180]  An idea whose time has come, to quote Victor Hugo.
[01:03:40.601 --> 01:03:42.961]  And it's true, no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[01:03:44.442 --> 01:03:56.126]  And InfoWars has been proven right on the NSA, on the spy grids, on the microphones in the lampposts, on the states saying your kids belong to them, on the vaccines having cancer viruses, and most cancer being viral, and just everything!
[01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:57.327]  We know what we're talking about!
[01:03:58.151 --> 01:04:07.118]  Because there's the real world and real medical literature and real trade publications and real think tanks who communicate with each other about all this stuff, and then there's mainstream media.
[01:04:07.958 --> 01:04:15.784]  And up until now, there were these rules that you don't talk about chimeras, you don't talk about GMOs or glyphosates, or you don't talk about world government.
[01:04:15.904 --> 01:04:20.628]  Now, they've become so obsolete that they're kind of going, ah, go ahead and tell everybody.
[01:04:22.602 --> 01:04:23.542]  Because it doesn't matter anymore.
[01:04:23.562 --> 01:04:24.883]  They've already dug the hole too deep.
[01:04:25.283 --> 01:04:28.704]  And it's too little too late, mainstream media, to come out and tell the truth.
[01:04:28.744 --> 01:04:30.044]  People don't trust you.
[01:04:30.084 --> 01:04:30.804]  They don't like you.
[01:04:31.424 --> 01:04:42.267]  This battle with the globalists is ours to lose if we just realize there's a church government-run PSYOP that the end of the world comes and we're raptured first, so no one has to fight evil.
[01:04:43.008 --> 01:04:44.028]  It's the ultimate PSYOP.
[01:04:45.011 --> 01:04:48.236]  But here's the deal, let's just say the rapture comes before world government and the antichrist.
[01:04:48.817 --> 01:04:53.483]  Will God really say he recognizes you at the white throne judgment of your accretion if you believe that like I do?
[01:04:54.004 --> 01:04:55.967]  If you didn't fight evil when it was right in front of you?
[01:04:56.367 --> 01:04:56.688]  Come on!
[01:04:57.068 --> 01:04:59.111]  You know that's not true in your gut, in your spirit.
[01:04:59.572 --> 01:04:59.893]  You know it!
[01:05:02.011 --> 01:05:17.598]  Two Roman Catholic bishops who led a central Pennsylvania diocese helped cover up the sexual abuse of hundreds of children by over 50 priests or religious leaders over a 40-year period, according to a grand jury report issued Tuesday, reports Fox News.
[01:05:17.838 --> 01:05:30.383]  The 147-page report on sexual abuse in the local diocese was based partly on evidence from a secret archive uncovered through a search warrant executed in August, said Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen King.
[01:05:30.523 --> 01:05:31.364]  We're good to go.
[01:05:47.156 --> 01:05:51.461]  No criminal charges are being filed in the case because some abusers have died.
[01:05:51.621 --> 01:05:57.668]  The statute of limitations has expired and in some cases the victims are too traumatized to testify, she said.
[01:05:57.848 --> 01:06:01.432]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:06:02.073 --> 01:06:08.454]  Everyone, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:06:08.734 --> 01:06:10.315]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:06:10.815 --> 01:06:20.717]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:27.058]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:06:27.478 --> 01:06:27.859]  We're good to go!
[01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:43.135]  We're good to go.
[01:07:08.436 --> 01:07:11.538]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[01:07:11.558 --> 01:07:15.301]  I needed to get my digestive system working correctly again.
[01:07:15.321 --> 01:07:16.041]  So I stumbled on the X2.
[01:07:16.061 --> 01:07:17.262]  I needed a detox basically.
[01:07:17.322 --> 01:07:17.903]  I started taking X2.
[01:07:32.194 --> 01:07:35.637]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[01:07:35.857 --> 01:07:36.898]  What do you have to lose?
[01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:45.727]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[01:07:46.235 --> 01:07:50.057]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[01:07:50.077 --> 01:07:51.578]  I was, like, really more natural.
[01:07:51.839 --> 01:07:56.101]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:07:56.121 --> 01:07:58.122]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:27.959 --> 01:08:29.560]  Super Tuesday has come and gone.
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:33.122]  Now we see the next big primary on the Ides of March, March 15th.
[01:08:34.003 --> 01:08:35.124]  Two big issues this hour.
[01:08:35.744 --> 01:08:37.645]  We're taking your phone calls, but the big issues are this.
[01:08:39.026 --> 01:08:50.773]  Clear evidence in key states of shaving votes for Marco Rubio and for Ted Cruz.
[01:08:53.175 --> 01:08:56.077]  Giving Trump votes to them to keep them in the race
[01:08:57.185 --> 01:09:02.749]  For a broker convention and to make sure that Trump does not have half the delegates when he gets in.
[01:09:02.929 --> 01:09:04.089]  He only has 316.
[01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:04.450]  They have 365.
[01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:07.612]  The four other candidates together.
[01:09:08.432 --> 01:09:10.754]  And then there will be a vote that goes around.
[01:09:10.834 --> 01:09:18.699]  If Trump doesn't get 50 percent, if the delegates don't pledge themselves, which the Republican leadership says they're not, they will then take it away from Donald Trump.
[01:09:18.739 --> 01:09:20.800]  So we better get on this now.
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:26.284]  They're going to spin it as sour grapes, but we have the Koch brothers, Marco Rubio and others in the news.
[01:09:27.585 --> 01:09:30.066]  He's saying we're going to go for a broker convention stratagem.
[01:09:32.207 --> 01:09:33.088]  And it's not a gambit.
[01:09:33.208 --> 01:09:34.188]  It's not desperate.
[01:09:34.348 --> 01:09:35.369]  It's been done before.
[01:09:36.449 --> 01:09:38.150]  And people are finally getting more political savvy.
[01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:43.293]  They're going, wait, you know, Hillary lost in New Hampshire in places but still got the delegates?
[01:09:43.393 --> 01:09:43.673]  Yeah.
[01:09:43.693 --> 01:09:48.255]  That's because the Democrats have actual superdelegates, a little bit different system.
[01:09:48.415 --> 01:09:53.178]  They just take them right there on the spot and then brag and say, yeah, doesn't matter what you do.
[01:09:54.502 --> 01:10:01.543]  Bernie's gonna lose, and suddenly he started losing all over, because his own people just went, well I just want to bet on a winner, I want to feel important, I want to buy into something.
[01:10:01.843 --> 01:10:02.684]  Sorry, Bernie!
[01:10:04.204 --> 01:10:05.984]  Because it's so rigged with the Democrats.
[01:10:06.004 --> 01:10:05.984]  100%.
[01:10:06.985 --> 01:10:09.205]  It's like 90% rigged with the Republicans.
[01:10:10.025 --> 01:10:11.385]  But there's a revolution.
[01:10:13.486 --> 01:10:18.607]  And what former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee talked about on Fox News last night,
[01:10:19.773 --> 01:10:22.359]  And this morning as well, is coffin nails of the system.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.129]  That this is really a revolution against tyranny.
[01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:30.196]  This is an overthrow of the illegitimate government.
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:42.004]  The reason that Trump is winning is because they feel like people in Washington have helped them lose, and they're sick of it.
[01:10:42.064 --> 01:10:46.747]  They've worked hard to get them elected, and when they get there, they don't do anything different, and I'll tell you why.
[01:10:47.187 --> 01:10:47.768]  Three words.
[01:10:48.068 --> 01:10:48.708]  Follow the money.
[01:10:49.008 --> 01:10:54.612]  The donor class runs the political environment of this country, and people are waking up to that, and they are tired of it.
[01:10:55.092 --> 01:10:57.693]  And that's what this election is largely about.
[01:10:58.074 --> 01:11:00.175]  It's an overthrow of the government, and you know what we ought to be?
[01:11:00.675 --> 01:11:05.896]  Glad that it is a peaceful revolution with ballots rather than one with bullets.
[01:11:06.576 --> 01:11:11.917]  And we're having in many ways somewhat of a political revolution in the Republican Party and in the country.
[01:11:31.578 --> 01:11:32.998]  Who's now trying to sew stuff up.
[01:11:33.359 --> 01:11:39.561]  Now that they pretty much had control, they thought, they want to get rid of people being able to give money to political campaigns.
[01:11:39.781 --> 01:11:42.062]  They want to get rid of free speech on the internet and talk radio.
[01:11:44.282 --> 01:11:54.746]  Because they think they've sewed it up, and they'll selectively enforce and let the Pope come and be political, and let all the Democrat churches be political, and let everybody else be political, unless you're a conservative, libertarian, Christian, or a veteran.
[01:11:57.127 --> 01:11:58.787]  Then they're going to persecute you.
[01:11:59.928 --> 01:12:00.688]  And shut you up.
[01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:07.373]  Everything's selectively enforced, like Obamacare, the taxes, all the insiders get exemptions.
[01:12:09.215 --> 01:12:11.656]  And Donald Trump says you're not going to get those exemptions anymore.
[01:12:14.878 --> 01:12:24.104]  They passed laws to have the highest corporate income tax in the world, the very corporations lobby for that, to make everyone move overseas, to break the country's back.
[01:12:24.364 --> 01:12:26.185]  The globalists admit that's their plan.
[01:12:27.955 --> 01:12:35.297]  China and India and 160 other countries plus can have dirty coal plants, but we can't have clean ones, and they're shutting over a thousand of ours down.
[01:12:36.357 --> 01:12:40.018]  No one can compete if our energy is two or three times what China's is.
[01:12:40.638 --> 01:12:41.599]  It's a plan.
[01:12:42.199 --> 01:12:43.799]  Trump calls it bad deals.
[01:12:43.899 --> 01:12:45.020]  It's not bad deals.
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:54.222]  It is a precision economic warfare takeover by the globalist class working with China, who has the biggest population, who's very hardworking.
[01:12:56.112 --> 01:13:00.135]  A billion, three hundred million Chinese, 70% of them working.
[01:13:01.375 --> 01:13:02.396]  And working hard.
[01:13:03.457 --> 01:13:05.578]  Such an oxymoron that the Chinese are communists.
[01:13:05.998 --> 01:13:09.200]  One of the most entrepreneurial free market people probably in the world.
[01:13:10.621 --> 01:13:11.442]  Who's more entrepreneurial?
[01:13:11.622 --> 01:13:12.883]  Maybe the Lebanese.
[01:13:13.463 --> 01:13:14.484]  The stereotypes are true.
[01:13:16.245 --> 01:13:17.826]  How could you do this?
[01:13:18.827 --> 01:13:22.129]  You bring Mao in, CIA funding, he kills 85 million of them that wouldn't play ball.
[01:13:22.809 --> 01:13:23.530]  84 million, excuse me.
[01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:25.491]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls now, but
[01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:28.320]  This is such a big deal.
[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:32.801]  And then I'm going to get to the amazing Van Jones flipping out when he's race baiting.
[01:13:33.201 --> 01:13:33.842]  It's incredible.
[01:13:34.842 --> 01:13:36.122]  And we've got more coming up.
[01:13:36.142 --> 01:13:37.622]  But right now, I want to go to your phone calls.
[01:13:37.742 --> 01:13:38.563]  Again, the big news.
[01:13:39.703 --> 01:13:41.423]  And I'm going to show this again for TV viewers.
[01:13:41.843 --> 01:13:43.624]  We can go over it for radio listeners.
[01:13:44.324 --> 01:13:46.504]  But the numbers are extremely clear.
[01:13:48.885 --> 01:13:50.825]  Trump got 316 delegates so far.
[01:13:54.893 --> 01:13:57.378]  And the other people have 365 combined.
[01:13:58.821 --> 01:14:01.707]  And so the Republicans can easily steal it from him at a broker convention.
[01:14:02.348 --> 01:14:03.310]  And they've said that's their plan!
[01:14:06.107 --> 01:14:13.651]  Now they have articles out saying I'm a conspiracy theorist, Roger Stone's a conspiracy theorist, there's no plan to have a burger convention, even though they admit they're planning it.
[01:14:13.831 --> 01:14:14.971]  They don't want to debate about that.
[01:14:14.991 --> 01:14:21.134]  They want to stall you, saying it doesn't exist, just like there's no Obamacare, fines or fees, because they were delayed three years.
[01:14:21.174 --> 01:14:23.255]  Now they're, this year, going into place.
[01:14:23.555 --> 01:14:26.176]  They went into place for businesses with more than 50 employees last year.
[01:14:26.637 --> 01:14:26.997]  Hit us.
[01:14:28.403 --> 01:14:31.405]  And then now, this year, individuals get to enjoy $900 to $5,000 fines.
[01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:34.466]  Nico Acosta, he got hit with a $900 smacker last week!
[01:14:44.807 --> 01:14:46.328]  You like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.
[01:14:46.528 --> 01:14:47.509]  I never said that, he said.
[01:14:48.309 --> 01:14:49.270]  This is mind games.
[01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.690]  Gruber.
[01:14:50.031 --> 01:14:52.112]  It's a good thing the public's dumb and doesn't pay attention.
[01:14:52.372 --> 01:14:53.573]  That's how we triple prices.
[01:14:53.873 --> 01:14:56.515]  And I was brought in by the big insurance companies and banks and Obama.
[01:14:56.695 --> 01:14:57.336]  That's my plan.
[01:14:57.516 --> 01:15:01.359]  And the professors and the graduate students on C-SPAN, there was like 15 videos of this.
[01:15:01.799 --> 01:15:05.442]  They were just like, oh, oh, oh my gosh, you're such a great liar.
[01:15:05.702 --> 01:15:08.644]  So you don't build things now, you lie and screw people.
[01:15:09.444 --> 01:15:11.566]  And you, you, you, you get promoted for it.
[01:15:13.953 --> 01:15:21.419]  And you go on CNN and Fox and go, and Paul Ryan comes out yesterday and says he will not decry the Klan, the party of Lincoln.
[01:15:21.439 --> 01:15:22.159]  This is outrageous.
[01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:23.841]  How dare Donald Trump?
[01:15:23.941 --> 01:15:26.803]  I am not, I was not going to get involved, but he's gone too far.
[01:15:27.243 --> 01:15:32.908]  No, and he'd already done it 10 times by then, and then four times we know of last night.
[01:15:34.549 --> 01:15:41.034]  14 times not good enough for that snot-nosed pretty boy, punk Paul Ryan, rhino piece of trash!
[01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:52.232]  Excuse me, 800-259-9231, your take on the election, your view on all this.
[01:15:52.292 --> 01:15:57.674]  But man, they sit there and lie with a straight face, with his pretty little blue twinkly eyes.
[01:16:00.515 --> 01:16:01.695]  How dare Donald Trump?
[01:16:01.735 --> 01:16:03.416]  This is how they mind game everybody.
[01:16:04.356 --> 01:16:06.417]  Some channels are still saying he won't decry the Klan.
[01:16:06.977 --> 01:16:11.519]  They just will lie, they will lie, and they will lie, and they will lie.
[01:16:11.679 --> 01:16:14.080]  But here's the good news, a lot of people don't believe your bull anymore.
[01:16:15.083 --> 01:16:21.826]  Hey Alex, I'm a little disappointed you're not doing more to teach us how to become delegates and take this over.
[01:16:21.846 --> 01:16:25.448]  Well, I'm not trying to say it's your fault.
[01:16:43.494 --> 01:16:49.577]  I went to the delegate last night, and it's the same church group that's there every time, and there's eight of them.
[01:16:49.637 --> 01:16:53.599]  They all vote for each other, and they're the delegates, and they lock everybody else out.
[01:16:53.739 --> 01:16:55.120]  Let me just stop you.
[01:16:56.601 --> 01:17:10.589]  Because I don't mind criticism, but I've probably done the last six months, let's not exaggerate, 20 full segments or more on the delegate process in very state-to-state.
[01:17:11.513 --> 01:17:11.713]  All right.
[01:17:29.952 --> 01:17:33.014]  In space and time, it's like I write a book on something.
[01:17:33.114 --> 01:17:33.794]  There it is.
[01:17:33.874 --> 01:17:36.335]  Go read that book or go watch the free video.
[01:17:36.635 --> 01:17:37.636]  I can't just sit here.
[01:17:37.716 --> 01:17:39.997]  I'm saying they're trying to steal the delegate process.
[01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:41.078]  They're stealing the vote.
[01:17:41.358 --> 01:17:41.938]  Get involved.
[01:17:41.978 --> 01:17:42.558]  Get informed.
[01:17:42.638 --> 01:17:48.761]  I can't sit here, though, and teach people how to change a tire over and over and over again for four hours a day.
[01:17:49.522 --> 01:17:53.384]  I'm teaching people how to change a tire probably once a show or every two shows.
[01:17:53.784 --> 01:17:57.826]  Do you understand that I would murder the program if all I talked about was the delegate process?
[01:18:00.054 --> 01:18:03.636]  If I listen 12 hours a day, you're not actually really informing us on it.
[01:18:04.337 --> 01:18:06.758]  Okay, well then you're a better man than I am.
[01:18:07.098 --> 01:18:07.959]  I'm a bad person.
[01:18:07.979 --> 01:18:09.440]  I apologize.
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:10.341]  You have the floor.
[01:18:10.601 --> 01:18:11.241]  Tell us how to do it.
[01:18:13.443 --> 01:18:17.225]  Well, it's not just going in and being a delegate.
[01:18:17.705 --> 01:18:23.569]  If there's a group of eight and they only vote for those eight guys, and if you're a Trump person,
[01:18:24.161 --> 01:18:26.221]  You only vote for other Trump people.
[01:18:26.542 --> 01:18:30.222]  You don't vote for anybody else, because then those other delegates get your vote.
[01:18:31.043 --> 01:18:39.044]  And these older churchgoers, they know this, and they're the same people there every time, and they're the delegates.
[01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:45.086]  So they lock everybody else out, because they go in a group, and they only vote for their own group.
[01:18:45.876 --> 01:18:55.180]  I agree, so people that get the, this year I have my little delegate card, and I'm going to go and try to become a delegate, and then a super delegate, so that's exactly what we're doing.
[01:18:55.580 --> 01:19:00.083]  Did you see that video we shot when we went and voted, it's about 20 minutes long, talking about the process?
[01:19:01.703 --> 01:19:02.604]  No, I don't.
[01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:04.124]  I'm disappointed in you.
[01:19:04.144 --> 01:19:05.125]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:19:05.485 --> 01:19:09.547]  If I've got to be talking about it all the time, you've got to be watching it all, and I'm disappointed in you, Noel.
[01:19:14.097 --> 01:19:15.538]  Brother, I'm being sarcastic.
[01:19:15.618 --> 01:19:16.719]  I don't mind criticism.
[01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:20.061]  It's just the default, Alex needs to do more.
[01:19:21.262 --> 01:19:23.863]  I've pretty much gone insane, I work so much, brother.
[01:19:24.664 --> 01:19:27.826]  I fell asleep last night, and they woke me up to go on air.
[01:19:29.306 --> 01:19:30.747]  I went home and fell asleep at 8 o'clock.
[01:19:30.807 --> 01:19:31.588]  I was so exhausted.
[01:19:31.608 --> 01:19:33.329]  I got back up, and I'm not complaining.
[01:19:33.689 --> 01:19:36.431]  It's just, it's an idea that I have to do more.
[01:19:36.491 --> 01:19:38.292]  Brother, you're doing a great job too, okay?
[01:19:38.312 --> 01:19:39.713]  I was being a little bit sarcastic.
[01:19:40.033 --> 01:19:41.334]  We need to shift back to the issue here.
[01:19:42.592 --> 01:19:44.193]  They're trying to steal the election from Donald Trump.
[01:19:44.754 --> 01:19:45.414]  Thank you, Noel.
[01:19:46.335 --> 01:19:48.816]  And it varies state to state, so check your laws.
[01:19:49.237 --> 01:19:50.337]  Go look it up online.
[01:19:50.397 --> 01:19:52.979]  It's there, the election rules, the state websites.
[01:19:53.159 --> 01:19:54.460]  I cannot spoon feed people.
[01:19:55.321 --> 01:19:57.602]  I can show people how to wipe their rear end one time.
[01:19:57.622 --> 01:19:59.824]  I'm not going to come over to your house and wipe your rear end.
[01:19:59.964 --> 01:20:00.845]  It's just not happening.
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:09.442]  Hey, I rode the elevator with you, but I don't work on the upper floors.
[01:20:09.883 --> 01:20:16.406]  I just want to squeeze in there right next to you, so the RFID scanner in my pocket can capture all your personal information.
[01:20:16.726 --> 01:20:19.868]  Your debit and credit cards, even your work ID badge.
[01:20:20.248 --> 01:20:22.589]  So your identity is now my identity.
[01:20:23.170 --> 01:20:23.610]  Going up.
[01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:32.492]  So am I. For over 10 years, ID Stronghold has pioneered RFID-blocking wallets and ID badge holders for consumers, the U.S.
[01:20:32.532 --> 01:20:35.293]  military, and even the Executive Office of the President.
[01:20:35.813 --> 01:20:37.334]  Shouldn't you be protected too?
[01:20:37.954 --> 01:20:42.615]  ID Stronghold wallets cost about the same as wallets in most stores, but give you extra protection.
[01:20:42.935 --> 01:20:45.636]  I'm Wal Augustinowitz, founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[01:20:45.956 --> 01:20:47.857]  Don't be a victim of electronic pickpocketing.
[01:20:48.037 --> 01:20:51.998]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID Stronghold wallets, card sleeves, and purses.

[01:21:33.014 --> 01:21:34.515]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:21:34.835 --> 01:21:36.116]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:21:36.476 --> 01:21:38.817]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:21:39.298 --> 01:21:41.159]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:21:41.599 --> 01:21:45.642]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:21:46.102 --> 01:21:49.805]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[01:21:54.148 --> 01:21:55.569]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:22:02.256 --> 01:22:03.576]  Hi, my name is Nick Lupo.
[01:22:03.876 --> 01:22:06.977]  One World Way has been by far the best protein that I've ever had.
[01:22:07.137 --> 01:22:08.458]  I take it three times a day.
[01:22:08.758 --> 01:22:14.119]  Once in the morning as soon as I wake, once for a pre-workout snack, and once for a post-workout recovery drink.
[01:22:14.139 --> 01:22:17.560]  It has helped me transform and sculpt my body into what I have now.
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:22.822]  I began taking the product about two years ago, and boy let me tell you, I'm in the best shape of my life.
[01:22:22.982 --> 01:22:26.503]  I've seen major muscle mass gains and have zero percent body fat.
[01:22:26.663 --> 01:22:30.864]  I have had people in my gym ask if I compete in bodybuilding because of how lean and muscular I am.
[01:22:31.124 --> 01:22:37.367]  I used to suffer from everyday aches and pains from hard manual labor my whole life, and arthritis that runs through my family.
[01:22:37.567 --> 01:22:41.408]  But One World Way has helped me take that everyday pain from a 10 to a 3.
[01:22:41.869 --> 01:22:44.470]  Some days I feel no pain at all, just full of life and energy.
[01:22:44.490 --> 01:22:47.591]  It has also helped my skin look younger and healthier.
[01:22:47.831 --> 01:22:50.432]  Thank you, Synergistic Nutrition, for One World Way.
[01:22:50.772 --> 01:22:53.714]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[01:22:53.774 --> 01:22:55.774]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y, dot com.
[01:23:00.925 --> 01:23:04.430]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:23:05.171 --> 01:23:05.672]  It's true.
[01:23:05.792 --> 01:23:09.738]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:23:09.938 --> 01:23:11.781]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:23:12.341 --> 01:23:16.808]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:23:17.108 --> 01:23:29.715]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.
[01:23:29.975 --> 01:23:33.477]  Big Berkey Water Filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[01:23:33.777 --> 01:23:36.058]  The gold standard in water purification.
[01:23:36.418 --> 01:23:40.461]  And our filters last for years at less than two cents per gallon.
[01:23:40.741 --> 01:23:41.361]  Big Berkey.
[01:23:41.561 --> 01:23:45.063]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[01:23:45.263 --> 01:23:46.864]  Get your Big Berkey today.
[01:23:47.024 --> 01:23:49.305]  Call 1-877-99-BERKEY or click BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:23:49.325 --> 01:23:50.006]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:23:50.146 --> 01:23:51.406]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[01:23:51.466 --> 01:23:52.527]  For the love of clean water.
[01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:12.611]  The lies of this song are satirical.
[01:24:12.651 --> 01:24:13.912]  You're supposed to know it's a lie.
[01:24:14.592 --> 01:24:16.873]  If you leave me, I won't miss you.
[01:24:21.395 --> 01:24:26.777]  And I won't ever take you back.
[01:24:26.917 --> 01:24:31.639]  Good old George Strait.
[01:24:31.739 --> 01:24:32.780]  Won't ever haunt me.
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:36.381]  You know, memories of women used to haunt me.
[01:24:37.501 --> 01:24:38.422]  Now, the haunting
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:41.081]  It's kind of fun, you know what I mean?
[01:24:42.001 --> 01:24:45.103]  It's funny how pain over time turns into something different.
[01:24:45.804 --> 01:24:54.909]  Yeah, if you believe I don't miss you and don't want you... I got some oceanfront property.
[01:24:55.750 --> 01:25:07.817]  If you think the globalists care about you and your family... If you don't think they're trying to dumb you down and turn you into a mindless idiot so they can totally enslave you and then phase you out...
[01:25:09.352 --> 01:25:11.133]  I got some oceanfront property in Arizona.
[01:25:11.694 --> 01:25:13.415]  From my front porch, you can see the sea.
[01:25:17.377 --> 01:25:19.219]  Girl, your memory won't ever haunt.
[01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:21.460]  Some good stuff.
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:22.481]  Too bad he's retired.
[01:25:23.321 --> 01:25:24.142]  We knew he wouldn't retire.
[01:25:24.162 --> 01:25:25.703]  He's gonna do select shows in Vegas.
[01:25:26.904 --> 01:25:29.626]  Guess that's where you die and go to heaven.
[01:25:30.686 --> 01:25:31.467]  When you quit touring.
[01:25:32.247 --> 01:25:32.888]  Good part right here.
[01:25:37.964 --> 01:25:39.585]  Ground, you walk on.
[01:25:41.026 --> 01:25:50.111]  Never have, and that's a fact.
[01:25:50.171 --> 01:25:51.411]  Try to find you.
[01:25:51.491 --> 01:25:55.053]  Cause I don't love you.
[01:25:55.213 --> 01:25:56.434]  I'm sorry, I'm singing along to the song.
[01:25:56.474 --> 01:25:57.395]  This is unintentional.
[01:25:58.555 --> 01:26:01.077]  But I have bumper music I love.
[01:26:01.157 --> 01:26:03.918]  So then once I start getting to it, I have trouble turning it off.
[01:26:03.958 --> 01:26:07.040]  But there's allegories again, and parables.
[01:26:08.157 --> 01:26:11.558]  And parallels to everything we see today in a song like this.
[01:26:12.539 --> 01:26:26.304]  If you don't think Van Jones and all these people aren't Ford Foundation trained to destroy this country and that they aren't scientists creating racism to control the population, I got a bridge in Brooklyn I'm ready to sell you.
[01:26:27.725 --> 01:26:33.087]  And if you don't think the mega banks don't want to screw you and your family over, I got a bridge I'm ready to sell you as well.
[01:26:34.653 --> 01:26:35.534]  I want to go back to your calls.
[01:26:35.554 --> 01:26:36.955]  I'm going to get to a bunch of these clips coming up.
[01:26:36.995 --> 01:26:40.938]  And I shouldn't have got in an argument with Noel earlier, but the whole crew was in there going, absolutely.
[01:26:41.558 --> 01:26:44.740]  The delegate process is different in every state, every county, every city.
[01:26:45.041 --> 01:26:47.402]  You got to go deal with your own little mafia individually.
[01:26:48.703 --> 01:26:52.986]  So the claim that I need to be walking people through the delegate process everywhere, it's impossible.
[01:26:54.047 --> 01:26:55.488]  You need to walk yourselves through it.
[01:26:55.508 --> 01:26:56.649]  But I do get the frustration.
[01:26:56.949 --> 01:26:59.631]  So when we're frustrated at the new world order, let's not tear each other up.
[01:26:59.651 --> 01:27:02.874]  Because I'm in an aggressive mode as well.
[01:27:05.026 --> 01:27:09.128]  Let's talk to Daryl in the great state of Texas, formerly Texas, now under FEMA Region 6.
[01:27:09.789 --> 01:27:11.670]  But our governor's fighting back for sovereignty.
[01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:13.911]  We're almost a sovereign state again.
[01:27:15.392 --> 01:27:17.933]  More talk about revolution against the corrupt government.
[01:27:18.374 --> 01:27:21.736]  Life's coming out of the mouth of Old Huckabee.
[01:27:21.836 --> 01:27:22.916]  We might actually get there.
[01:27:23.717 --> 01:27:24.697]  This is not a revolution.
[01:27:24.998 --> 01:27:29.100]  It's an overthrow of an occupying force, like the French Resistance overthrowing the Nazis.
[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:31.161]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:27:31.261 --> 01:27:32.862]  Daryl in Tejas.
[01:27:32.882 --> 01:27:34.043]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:27:35.609 --> 01:27:47.452]  Alex, I was voting in Milam County yesterday, and I noticed one of the officials taking the voting machine, one of the portable voting machines, out of the area.
[01:27:48.112 --> 01:27:57.094]  And I asked what's going on, and they said that they had several voting machines go down and just go black in Milam County.
[01:27:57.134 --> 01:28:02.256]  At this point, they don't know really what happened, and that's the problem with this system.
[01:28:03.894 --> 01:28:06.955]  The people that are operating these things know nothing about them.
[01:28:06.995 --> 01:28:12.576]  Somebody else programs it, and then they've been proven to be engaged in fraud thousands of times by design.
[01:28:12.916 --> 01:28:21.399]  Insiders have testified from at least six different big companies, and all over the country, ballots, scantrons, or punch cards were also pre-marked for Rubio.
[01:28:22.039 --> 01:28:26.560]  What a surprise the guy that the establishment wants, the Ferengi ambassador!
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.881]  You know, at least when you have a written ballot,
[01:28:31.573 --> 01:28:36.897]  Yes, you could have ballot stuffing and extra ballot, but you don't have to understand how it works.
[01:28:37.937 --> 01:28:41.800]  You know, you can just put your hands on them, basically, and watch them.
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:49.786]  And you gotta catch people shipping in the fake ones, and they catch them in a back warehouse filling them out, or a truck tumps over, and they're always getting caught the old way.
[01:28:50.066 --> 01:28:54.409]  It's much better to just have a little computer program in there, and then it all comes out in the wash.
[01:28:54.449 --> 01:28:56.530]  They have algorithms that shave the numbers.
[01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:58.972]  It's all very sophisticated now.
[01:29:00.768 --> 01:29:12.035]  I wanted to get you to critique an idea I have, Alex, and that is, as far as Washington is concerned, the way I see ending this whole process of corruption is the only way to do it.
[01:29:12.295 --> 01:29:21.941]  Right now, what we have is an analogy where we give the teenagers the keys to the beach house in Washington and we shake our finger at them and we tell them, don't do that again.
[01:29:22.382 --> 01:29:23.342]  Don't have any parties.
[01:29:24.663 --> 01:29:27.325]  And what I'm saying is... And now they've done it so many times.
[01:29:27.605 --> 01:29:28.486]  Come back to the allegory.
[01:29:29.682 --> 01:29:34.263]  You come back a month later and they're such criminals now and they got bad friends that have come in and taken over the beach house.
[01:29:34.683 --> 01:29:35.843]  Their friends are crack dealers.
[01:29:35.883 --> 01:29:42.825]  They tie you up and torture you to get the codes to your bank account and then after they shoot you in the back of the head and bury you in the sand dunes and then kill your kids.
[01:29:43.245 --> 01:29:44.625]  That's basically what happened to Washington.
[01:29:44.805 --> 01:29:49.626]  They sold out the foreign murderers and they're getting ready to cap us all in the head and complete the takeover.
[01:29:49.866 --> 01:29:50.906]  That's actually what's going on.
[01:29:51.367 --> 01:29:52.267]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.767 --> 01:29:54.367]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.307 --> 01:29:57.988]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.225 --> 01:30:07.610]  We are quickly approaching the five-year anniversary of Osama Bin Laden's supposed death at the hands of Navy SEALs.
[01:30:07.770 --> 01:30:14.617]  And to commemorate this, the Obama administration released 113 documents that were seized in the May 2nd, 2011 raid.
[01:30:14.917 --> 01:30:21.904]  And if you read the myriad of articles at Daily Mail, he supposedly writes he wants to leave his vast multi-million dollar fortune to the global jihad.
[01:30:22.124 --> 01:30:24.647]  He also worried that his wife had been implanted with a tracking chip.
[01:30:24.847 --> 01:30:27.188]  But he doesn't sign any of the documents in his name.
[01:30:27.408 --> 01:30:33.030]  He signs one, Saeed bin Usama, another, Usama bin Muhammad, and another, Abu Abdallah.
[01:30:33.230 --> 01:30:37.352]  But I ask, why didn't he use his CIA codename of Tim Osman in any of these letters?
[01:30:37.712 --> 01:30:41.914]  Remember, it was C. Bell Edmonds, the FBI translator, who broke a gag order and said that the U.S.
[01:30:41.934 --> 01:30:47.636]  had been working with Osama bin Laden right up until 9-11, and they were outsourcing him to conduct terror operations all over the world.
[01:30:47.916 --> 01:30:48.757]  There's one final note.
[01:30:48.797 --> 01:30:52.178]  He was calling on Americans to help President Obama fight climate change.
[01:30:52.378 --> 01:30:58.083]  So using liberal logic, if you don't disavow climate change, then you were for Osama bin Laden.
[01:30:58.403 --> 01:31:01.226]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[01:31:01.826 --> 01:31:06.190]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[01:31:06.490 --> 01:31:11.114]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:31:11.254 --> 01:31:12.255]  Talk about the effects.
[01:31:12.575 --> 01:31:14.056]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:31:14.076 --> 01:31:15.718]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:31:16.018 --> 01:31:17.079]  I feel like I look better.
[01:31:17.119 --> 01:31:17.779]  I feel better.
[01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:18.860]  I feel sexier.
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:19.601]  I love it.
[01:31:19.861 --> 01:31:22.762]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[01:31:22.822 --> 01:31:25.543]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.

[01:33:12.751 --> 01:33:16.872]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:33:17.632 --> 01:33:18.933]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:20.713 --> 01:33:23.974]  Alright, I want to go to more of your calls and a bunch of these clips and reports I've got to get to.
[01:33:23.994 --> 01:33:27.475]  I was talking to Daryl in Texas.
[01:33:27.515 --> 01:33:30.436]  Daryl, you were getting to a parable.
[01:33:32.873 --> 01:33:47.124]  Which of course is biblical or historical where you can tell a story that is an example or something contemporary to what's happening now to try to finally get people to learn from the experience of others.
[01:33:47.144 --> 01:33:51.608]  Because you can get knowledge through revelation, through experience, or through teaching.
[01:33:53.049 --> 01:33:57.332]  And unfortunately so many people just want to get it through experience.
[01:33:57.633 --> 01:34:00.275]  And sometimes that can be the school of hard knocks.
[01:34:03.217 --> 01:34:09.843]  But you were getting into Washington's like, kids you leave for the weekend with the beach house, teenagers, and then finish your story.
[01:34:09.924 --> 01:34:17.191]  I was saying, well, it's like teenagers that take over, become crackheads, criminals come in, you come back, you want them kicked out.
[01:34:18.527 --> 01:34:27.395]  The criminals tie you down and torture you for your ATM numbers and bank numbers, shut the money out, and then finally kill you and your kids and bury you in the sand dunes.
[01:34:27.615 --> 01:34:29.477]  That's the kind of thing that happens all the time, actually.
[01:34:30.098 --> 01:34:32.980]  Teenagers get under the influence of older criminals and will do anything.
[01:34:33.763 --> 01:34:34.924]  Including killing their families.
[01:34:36.305 --> 01:34:37.625]  So that's kind of what D.C.
[01:34:37.685 --> 01:34:37.765]  is.
[01:34:37.785 --> 01:34:51.314]  A bunch of snot-nosed corrupt filth run by offshore crime cartels who want to sew up the country for themselves and have a bunch of soft, stupid, socialist college grads that think they're about to run a military op against what's left of the republic.
[01:34:51.694 --> 01:34:55.756]  The skeleton of this republic in a civil war will annihilate you.
[01:34:56.137 --> 01:34:57.537]  But I don't want to go that path.
[01:34:57.597 --> 01:35:02.941]  I want to have a peaceful restoration of the republic.
[01:35:03.777 --> 01:35:05.758]  An overthrow of this occupying force.
[01:35:06.259 --> 01:35:08.661]  And notice that narrative that I've been talking about for years.
[01:35:09.161 --> 01:35:29.976]  That if it ever gets out, bye-bye New World Order, because when everybody knows the world government, that New World Order is about multinational, above-the-law, diplomatically immune crime syndicates that run child kidnapping, snuff films, drugs, pharmaceuticals, everything evil you can imagine.
[01:35:30.816 --> 01:35:32.618]  Once that all comes out, because it's a fact,
[01:35:33.888 --> 01:35:35.129]  What do they say in Aliens?
[01:35:35.289 --> 01:35:36.570]  Game over, man!
[01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:37.310]  Game over!
[01:35:37.330 --> 01:35:45.656]  And you need to understand that the military already knows.
[01:35:46.576 --> 01:35:49.098]  They already knew the narrative, but I crystallized it.
[01:35:50.579 --> 01:35:59.945]  And now other people have picked up on the narrative that I have analyzed, and others have, but let's just give credit where it's super dangerously due, right here.
[01:35:59.965 --> 01:36:01.406]  Game over, man!
[01:36:01.586 --> 01:36:02.127]  Game over!
[01:36:04.468 --> 01:36:05.768]  And we're coming for you.
[01:36:06.789 --> 01:36:07.749]  And we're not stopping.
[01:36:08.669 --> 01:36:09.769]  We're not backing down.
[01:36:10.590 --> 01:36:11.530]  We're not intimidated.
[01:36:11.770 --> 01:36:14.951]  And when you run false flags now, you know we're watching you.
[01:36:16.031 --> 01:36:18.492]  And we're analyzing it, second one.
[01:36:24.534 --> 01:36:26.014]  Daryl in Texas, go ahead and finish your point.
[01:36:27.423 --> 01:36:33.348]  Yeah, you're never going to stop the teenagers from lying if you let them have the keys to the beach house and keep sending them checks.
[01:36:33.529 --> 01:36:39.414]  But if you make the teenagers live at home, Washington is not necessary with today's technology.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:43.382]  I believe the Constitution requires them to meet for like a month.
[01:36:43.562 --> 01:36:52.127]  They could play dress-up for a month if they wanted to, but the majority of their discussions and their bill passing and things like that can be done through technology.
[01:36:52.467 --> 01:37:02.633]  They come home, all the senators and the congressmen have their office in their home state, right in our backyard, and when they're dealing with something, we are right there in their office.
[01:37:02.653 --> 01:37:05.014]  They don't have five offices spread across the country.
[01:37:05.334 --> 01:37:08.776]  The keys to the beach house are taken from them in-game.
[01:37:11.391 --> 01:37:12.372]  You're absolutely right.
[01:37:12.412 --> 01:37:18.857]  In fact, I'm asking the crew to pull up the Swiss form of government and the map of cantons.
[01:37:19.719 --> 01:37:26.263]  And they've got cantons out of the states that convene only a few times a year to make federal decisions.
[01:37:26.704 --> 01:37:34.289]  They have the lowest crime rate in the world, the highest standard of living, and they're the only country in Europe not letting the radical jihadis in.
[01:37:34.569 --> 01:37:37.171]  They're letting some in, and it is amazing.
[01:37:38.252 --> 01:37:41.494]  And actually, we should have the canton modeled
[01:37:42.719 --> 01:37:45.241]  Integrated into our system, which is what it was designed off of.
[01:37:45.681 --> 01:37:53.126]  Our system was signed, was hooked up off of the old Dutch program, which they got rid of a hundred years later, and off the Canton system.
[01:37:53.146 --> 01:37:54.106]  That's what the founder said.
[01:37:54.487 --> 01:37:57.409]  Integrated with Iroquois Native American systems.
[01:37:57.989 --> 01:38:00.090]  And that's a fact, that's in the history books.
[01:38:00.130 --> 01:38:02.692]  So it's Iroquois, it's about 20% Iroquois, about 40%
[01:38:07.398 --> 01:38:13.119]  About 40% Canton and another 40% or so Dutch system.
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:17.781]  I mean, they claim it's Greek and democracy.
[01:38:17.861 --> 01:38:20.321]  No, that was two buckets, black stones, white stones.
[01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:24.362]  The ruling class could vote on even killing you for your free speech.
[01:38:24.643 --> 01:38:26.103]  That is not where we come from.
[01:38:26.403 --> 01:38:27.683]  That is not what we are.
[01:38:28.243 --> 01:38:30.024]  And it just shows how ignorant the public is.
[01:38:32.196 --> 01:38:37.278]  By the way, Max Keiser did an incredible description of democracy on his show Monday, and I meant to air it.
[01:38:37.298 --> 01:38:47.922]  It's like a 10-minute... It's a 20-minute piece, but I'd like to take his point on democracy and then go to my interview with him, because I was calm and people really liked it, so I want to air Max Keiser's piece sometime this week.
[01:38:49.022 --> 01:38:49.383]  Okay.
[01:38:50.323 --> 01:38:51.323]  Thank you so much, Daryl.
[01:38:51.343 --> 01:38:52.244]  That's a really great point.
[01:38:53.044 --> 01:38:54.224]  Let's talk to Rick in Michigan.
[01:38:54.244 --> 01:38:54.745]  You're on the air.
[01:38:54.785 --> 01:38:55.105]  Go ahead.
[01:38:55.125 --> 01:38:59.827]  Are you there?
[01:39:00.187 --> 01:39:00.827]  No, I sure am, bro.
[01:39:02.591 --> 01:39:04.813]  Hey Alex, first time caller here.
[01:39:04.853 --> 01:39:10.880]  Just want to thank you so much for all the information that you and your staff pump out on a daily basis.
[01:39:12.121 --> 01:39:15.124]  I wish the whole world was listening to you guys.
[01:39:15.685 --> 01:39:21.671]  Unfortunately, they're not, but we need to do whatever we can to make that happen, right?
[01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:23.831]  Brother, I'm trying.
[01:39:23.851 --> 01:39:25.392]  I am fully committed.
[01:39:26.072 --> 01:39:30.815]  And I used to have so much frustration that we weren't getting enough change fast enough.
[01:39:31.275 --> 01:39:33.076]  I'm just so committed now, it just doesn't even matter.
[01:39:33.136 --> 01:39:39.800]  In fact, I'm pretty much possessed, in a good way, totally overtaken, fulfilled, in the fight against tyranny.
[01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:42.662]  Because I know this is a life and death struggle.
[01:39:43.022 --> 01:39:49.587]  There is no compromise with a system that comes to end the human system as we know it, and replace it with a monstrosity.
[01:39:51.308 --> 01:39:51.728]  Right on.
[01:39:52.433 --> 01:39:55.355]  So I wanted to get your take on this thought.
[01:39:55.875 --> 01:40:03.280]  You know, there's all kinds of talk in the media about how the GOP is scared of Donald Trump.
[01:40:04.141 --> 01:40:10.225]  But I think the people that are really the most afraid of him is the Democrats.
[01:40:10.285 --> 01:40:17.870]  Because if you look at what happened yesterday, the Democrats are losing people.
[01:40:18.451 --> 01:40:21.873]  They're coming over to vote in the GOP issues.
[01:40:22.951 --> 01:40:26.996]  And they had a horrible turnout on their side.
[01:40:27.496 --> 01:40:29.839]  In fact guys, I know it's in my stack but I can't find it.
[01:40:29.859 --> 01:40:34.384]  Will you guys reprint me voting totals this election versus 2012?
[01:40:35.585 --> 01:40:37.728]  Because you're right, this is since Reagan.
[01:40:38.208 --> 01:40:49.078]  This is the highest percentage of Republicans voting versus the lowest percentage of Democrats, which is what the demographers and political analysts across the board, political atheists, top professors are saying.
[01:40:49.098 --> 01:41:01.248]  97 to 99 percent chance Trump wins and maybe one of the biggest landslides in history, but definitely a gargantuan, colossal, mega tsunami.
[01:41:01.989 --> 01:41:12.993]  And so of course the entire establishment, from the Koch brothers to Fox News to CNN, are saying he's racist, he's evil, it's impossible, he will lose, he's unelectable, because he annihilates Hillary Clinton.
[01:41:13.293 --> 01:41:22.817]  But see, they have to put it in our mind that she's going to annihilate him in case they have to steal it, in case they can't beat him at the convention.
[01:41:23.137 --> 01:41:27.919]  They've got to get it in our minds that the corpse, the hacking corpse, the reanimated
[01:41:28.959 --> 01:41:32.682]  Absolutely, and like you just mentioned, it's tens of thousands of
[01:41:59.508 --> 01:42:07.492]  People who identify as Democrats or Independents, and he is just lighting a fire under this whole thing.
[01:42:07.532 --> 01:42:08.453]  He's going to burn it down.
[01:42:09.053 --> 01:42:14.536]  The whole thing here is that the Republican Party is expanding exponentially.
[01:42:14.716 --> 01:42:16.016]  Absolutely, and here's the deal.
[01:42:17.357 --> 01:42:20.659]  Trump is a pro-free market egomaniac.
[01:42:22.079 --> 01:42:24.981]  But he's our egomaniac, and I've had high-level people give me that exact quote.
[01:42:26.191 --> 01:42:32.676]  He really reportedly knows about the new world order now, hates it, is upset, and he wants to be George Washington part two.
[01:42:32.696 --> 01:42:33.417]  Well, I say let him.
[01:42:34.258 --> 01:42:34.698]  And you know what?
[01:42:34.738 --> 01:42:35.479]  It might get messy.
[01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:40.062]  But the establishment is, again, crapping their drawers.
[01:42:40.122 --> 01:42:41.583]  I hate to use that term, but that's what they're doing.
[01:42:41.603 --> 01:42:44.125]  I mean, a rose is a rose by any other name.
[01:42:44.145 --> 01:42:47.408]  Well, the globalists, you know, soiling themselves is that by any other name.
[01:42:47.908 --> 01:42:49.550]  And look at David Knight, you know, didn't like Trump.
[01:42:49.590 --> 01:42:50.690]  Now he's all in because
[01:42:51.641 --> 01:42:53.162]  This is real, folks.
[01:42:53.202 --> 01:42:55.064]  This is a revolution against the globalists.
[01:42:55.504 --> 01:42:55.884]  It's on.
[01:42:56.645 --> 01:42:57.286]  It is on.
[01:42:58.487 --> 01:42:59.187]  God bless you, Rick.
[01:42:59.207 --> 01:42:59.868]  Appreciate your call.
[01:42:59.888 --> 01:43:02.510]  I want to go to Adam, Bruce, Craig, Jeff, and others here.
[01:43:03.631 --> 01:43:09.175]  But first, speaking of the fix being in, don't feel bad if they steal the election from him or put a bullet in his head.
[01:43:09.195 --> 01:43:09.856]  I mean, feel bad.
[01:43:09.916 --> 01:43:11.977]  But no, it's a manifestation of the awakening.
[01:43:12.958 --> 01:43:15.620]  That's what Brzezinski said three years ago to the CFR.
[01:43:16.241 --> 01:43:19.804]  Used to, it was easy to spend, you know, propaganda money to brainwash a million people.
[01:43:19.844 --> 01:43:20.344]  Now we can't.
[01:43:20.364 --> 01:43:21.245]  It's easier to kill a million.
[01:43:22.887 --> 01:43:26.289]  As dumbed down as some of the public is, most people now know they're being lied to.
[01:43:27.170 --> 01:43:29.151]  And folks are figuring things out real quick.
[01:43:29.532 --> 01:43:33.494]  The growth curve of understanding, the learning curve is skyrocketing.
[01:43:35.576 --> 01:43:37.777]  And so, stuff is spectacular.
[01:43:37.977 --> 01:43:39.538]  I was in the shower this morning after I worked out.
[01:43:39.578 --> 01:43:41.240]  I had to put my head up against the wall.
[01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:47.404]  It was a good feeling, but also a bad feeling of, I can't believe how exciting the world is.
[01:43:47.524 --> 01:43:49.125]  I can't believe how incredible it is.
[01:43:49.245 --> 01:43:49.906]  I can't believe
[01:43:50.726 --> 01:43:53.548]  Forget watching a football game or a cliffhanger movie.
[01:43:54.049 --> 01:43:56.271]  I mean, we are seeing open world government.
[01:43:56.291 --> 01:43:57.872]  They're trying to start war with the Russians.
[01:43:57.892 --> 01:43:59.013]  I'm getting chills.
[01:43:59.173 --> 01:44:00.494]  War with the Communist Chinese.
[01:44:00.554 --> 01:44:02.075]  Foreign governments are telling us what to do.
[01:44:02.376 --> 01:44:04.838]  They're on the news saying fathers and families are bad.
[01:44:05.358 --> 01:44:07.320]  Total crazy cults are running wild.
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:08.841]  The borders are wide open.
[01:44:08.881 --> 01:44:10.202]  They're bringing in jihadis.
[01:44:11.343 --> 01:44:12.544]  But people are waking up.
[01:44:12.684 --> 01:44:15.947]  I mean, it's going to get crazier and wilder.
[01:44:15.967 --> 01:44:16.988]  I've been telling you this for years.
[01:44:17.028 --> 01:44:18.689]  And I said in the last few years, get ready.
[01:44:18.729 --> 01:44:19.009]  It's here.
[01:44:19.089 --> 01:44:19.390]  It's here.
[01:44:21.107 --> 01:44:22.568]  The animating contest of liberty.
[01:44:23.488 --> 01:44:24.988]  Thank God I'm alive right now.
[01:44:26.209 --> 01:44:29.450]  So many people selfishly say, I wish I would have lived in the olden times, it was simpler.
[01:44:29.490 --> 01:44:30.070]  I wish I would have.
[01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:31.651]  You don't know, you didn't live in that time.
[01:44:32.051 --> 01:44:33.692]  And sure, that's romantic, and I'm not knocking you.
[01:44:34.212 --> 01:44:35.672]  Man, you're alive now.
[01:44:35.932 --> 01:44:36.613]  Live now.
[01:44:37.313 --> 01:44:42.035]  This whole Wall Street system is to make you feel dead, and Madison Avenue, and Hollywood.
[01:44:43.275 --> 01:44:45.216]  They had the lowest Oscar ratings in history.
[01:44:46.024 --> 01:44:48.126]  And it wasn't just the lecturing and all of it.
[01:44:48.906 --> 01:44:58.935]  People are sick of a bunch of painted trollops and tough guys up there walking around trying to make commoners feel bad.
[01:45:00.516 --> 01:45:11.926]  People want to go outside and have a barbecue or go play football or soccer or go hang out with their buddies at the bar or go climb a hill or go, you know, pick up some, you know, girls or whatever you're out doing or go to church.
[01:45:13.226 --> 01:45:18.611]  And again, some people are more caught in the Matrix, but more than ever, people are getting out of it right now.
[01:45:18.631 --> 01:45:20.152]  It's just, I mean, it's a joke.
[01:45:20.253 --> 01:45:22.054]  I watch the Oscars for comedy.
[01:45:25.377 --> 01:45:26.538]  They've jumped the shark, folks.
[01:45:26.859 --> 01:45:27.719]  They're not invincible.
[01:45:30.522 --> 01:45:32.083]  And rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[01:45:32.884 --> 01:45:33.965]  I told you this years ago.
[01:45:34.766 --> 01:45:35.727]  I've probably talked
[01:45:37.970 --> 01:45:44.372]  Or know people that have talked to basically all the top people in Hollywood, except for producers and owners and stuff.
[01:45:44.392 --> 01:45:45.932]  They're pretty mafia, and I've talked to a lot of them.
[01:45:46.732 --> 01:45:51.833]  And they tell me, and they tell me to my face, you've heard a lot of them here on the show, that no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:45:52.093 --> 01:45:54.394]  Hollywood is Infowars.
[01:45:55.134 --> 01:45:58.515]  Hollywood is Libertarian, 1776, Patriot.
[01:45:58.975 --> 01:46:02.256]  How many times did I tell you Hollywood is 1776 and under total tyranny?
[01:46:02.976 --> 01:46:04.736]  And told you'll be fired if you don't do what we say.
[01:46:06.577 --> 01:46:07.417]  And then what did Russell
[01:46:09.463 --> 01:46:10.464]  Well, so many of them have come out.
[01:46:10.524 --> 01:46:13.206]  What did Kurt Russell come out and say?
[01:46:13.666 --> 01:46:15.788]  He said, I'm just libertarian, but I'm 1776.
[01:46:16.249 --> 01:46:17.329]  I'm founding fathers.
[01:46:17.630 --> 01:46:18.230]  I'm Americana.
[01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:19.051]  I've rediscovered it.
[01:46:19.611 --> 01:46:21.032]  Then you know that everything makes sense.
[01:46:25.476 --> 01:46:25.896]  And that's it.
[01:46:27.318 --> 01:46:29.299]  It's what they discovered in the Renaissance.
[01:46:29.339 --> 01:46:30.280]  We're just rediscovering it.
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:32.282]  And it's game over for the globalists if we just do that.
[01:46:33.803 --> 01:46:38.807]  But let me tell you, they get called in by people like Sumner Redstone, who's finally gotten senile and is drifting off into oblivion.
[01:46:40.814 --> 01:46:41.675]  Tough guy, but evil.
[01:46:42.135 --> 01:46:42.875]  Viacom owner.
[01:46:45.397 --> 01:46:45.977]  And they tell them.
[01:46:46.918 --> 01:46:54.843]  And I've been in meetings with the top Hollywood people's lawyers on productions.
[01:46:54.863 --> 01:46:55.884]  I don't even try it anymore.
[01:46:55.904 --> 01:46:56.484]  People just want me to.
[01:46:56.504 --> 01:46:57.405]  These were real meetings.
[01:46:57.445 --> 01:47:04.589]  I mean, out there with, you know, butlers bringing you food, you know, by a big pool with, you know, 50 yards away, women suntanning.
[01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:05.590]  I mean, right out of a movie.
[01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:09.913]  And I've been there with known big Hollywood names and top producers.
[01:47:14.761 --> 01:47:21.703]  And they will literally, when you're walking out to the car, they will just turn right to you and death threat you.
[01:47:23.383 --> 01:47:24.804]  And it's worse than the Godfather.
[01:47:24.844 --> 01:47:26.284]  I mean, it's just like that.
[01:47:26.924 --> 01:47:37.267]  It'll be an 80-year-old guy smoking cigarettes with a bodyguard, and they'll sit there and look right at you and say, we had our meeting, you stay out of it, and you don't produce it with them, or bad things are gonna happen.
[01:47:38.072 --> 01:47:39.633]  I'm like, alright, we'll drive safe, be careful.
[01:47:40.174 --> 01:47:41.035]  Got so scared.
[01:47:42.456 --> 01:47:43.637]  Are you threatening me?
[01:47:43.657 --> 01:47:45.018]  Because they couldn't believe I wasn't scared.
[01:47:45.239 --> 01:47:46.520]  And they got scared.
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:48.481]  Because these people are cowards, folks!
[01:47:55.408 --> 01:47:56.949]  Imagine you live in a world that's fake.
[01:47:57.129 --> 01:47:57.990]  Who are your heroes?
[01:47:58.330 --> 01:47:58.831]  Patriots.
[01:47:59.832 --> 01:48:01.854]  Imagine you live in a world that's totally plastic.
[01:48:02.234 --> 01:48:02.934]  Who are your enemies?
[01:48:03.815 --> 01:48:04.256]  If you're evil.
[01:48:05.267 --> 01:48:05.827]  The Patriots.
[01:48:06.568 --> 01:48:07.528]  We are the future.
[01:48:07.628 --> 01:48:08.548]  We are the leaders.
[01:48:08.829 --> 01:48:10.009]  We are 1776.
[01:48:11.130 --> 01:48:20.433]  We are those that were given the mantle and the birthright by George frickin' Washington and Thomas Jefferson.
[01:48:22.354 --> 01:48:24.195]  They've taught you to not know who they are, hate them.
[01:48:24.215 --> 01:48:26.056]  They were renowned around the world.
[01:48:26.076 --> 01:48:33.059]  George Washington for weeks had dysentery and lost about a third of his weight.
[01:48:34.403 --> 01:48:42.606]  And climbed around in freezing ice with his men where they would go on marches at night and they'd lose 10, 15 people just in one battalion freezing to death.
[01:48:45.586 --> 01:48:51.108]  To at dawn battle the Germans three to one at places like Trenton.
[01:48:55.149 --> 01:48:56.830]  In 30 below temperatures.
[01:48:58.177 --> 01:49:06.944]  In 20 plus mile marches, in the dark, with men dying all around them, and George Washington with diarrhea running out of his pants on top of that horse.
[01:49:07.484 --> 01:49:08.565]  Marching to kick ass!
[01:49:08.886 --> 01:49:10.027]  Marching not to give up!
[01:49:10.407 --> 01:49:11.268]  Taking action!
[01:49:11.528 --> 01:49:12.629]  That's who we come from!
[01:49:12.869 --> 01:49:15.291]  And we let all these hunchback scum rule us!
[01:49:15.691 --> 01:49:17.392]  I will never submit to you!
[01:49:18.333 --> 01:49:20.735]  And the human spirit is rising!
[01:49:21.195 --> 01:49:22.957]  You will not turn us into animals!
[01:49:23.297 --> 01:49:24.878]  You will not poison us anymore!
[01:49:25.099 --> 01:49:26.179]  You will not kill us!
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:29.541]  Our spirit transcends all you've done to us!
[01:49:34.963 --> 01:49:36.624]  I'm going to skip this break because it's so important.
[01:49:36.644 --> 01:49:37.364]  I'm going to get these reports.
[01:49:37.484 --> 01:49:38.325]  I said I was going to play them.
[01:49:41.746 --> 01:49:45.428]  And then he went to Trenton and the Hessians wrote this in our annals.
[01:49:47.895 --> 01:49:59.706]  They attack at dawn, the sentries, the Hessians all run out, thousands of them, and start at 200 yards, shooting at George Washington, thousands of them, and bullets were going through his hats, through his clothes, and they swore they were shooting him and nothing happened.
[01:50:03.029 --> 01:50:04.170]  It happened over and over again.
[01:50:06.092 --> 01:50:06.873]  Over and over again.
[01:50:11.343 --> 01:50:23.747]  And George Washington wrote, he didn't brag about all that stuff, he wrote, the whole time they were marching through all that snow and that ice and crossing those rivers, he was praying to God just to have the strength to get there and defeat that enemy.
[01:50:25.727 --> 01:50:27.368]  And you know he had the energy once he got there.
[01:50:27.388 --> 01:50:29.509]  Now that's where we come from.
[01:50:30.449 --> 01:50:31.169]  That's who we are.
[01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:35.670]  We're gonna sit here and let a bunch of trash tell us what to do and how to think?
[01:50:36.111 --> 01:50:36.311]  No.
[01:50:38.311 --> 01:50:40.712]  To quote V for Vendetta, ideas are bulletproof.
[01:50:43.737 --> 01:50:45.862]  No army can stop an idea whose time has come!
[01:50:50.411 --> 01:50:53.919]  Let's go to Joe Biggs' report, then Jakari's report on election fraud so we can detail this.
[01:50:53.939 --> 01:50:54.239]  Here it is.
[01:50:57.091 --> 01:50:58.912]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[01:50:58.952 --> 01:51:07.854]  Now, earlier today, listeners of the KLBJ radio show called in with concerns about the voting process that is happening on Super Tuesday.
[01:51:08.194 --> 01:51:14.696]  Now, multiple listeners called in saying that they had voted for Donald Trump, and yet Marco Rubio was showing up.
[01:51:14.856 --> 01:51:17.177]  This is the morning radio show host.
[01:51:17.197 --> 01:51:17.737]  What's your name, sir?
[01:51:17.817 --> 01:51:18.477]  Todd Jeffries.
[01:51:18.717 --> 01:51:21.698]  Now, Todd Jeffries, what happened this morning when you were doing your show?
[01:51:21.738 --> 01:51:22.999]  Yeah, it was pretty surprising.
[01:51:23.059 --> 01:51:25.820]  Probably about a dozen phone calls in a very short period of time.
[01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:33.282]  They, just like you outlined, they wanted to vote for Donald Trump, but in the end, when they went back to check, it showed that they voted for Marco Rubio.
[01:51:33.963 --> 01:51:38.044]  And some people actually called in saying that, well, it was a glitch.
[01:51:38.324 --> 01:51:41.125]  Well, it was operator error, a mistake, that sort of thing.
[01:51:41.526 --> 01:51:45.127]  Easily correctable if you just check your ballot before you leave the voting booth.
[01:51:45.948 --> 01:51:48.852]  But the bottom line is it's not accurate.
[01:51:50.014 --> 01:51:56.743]  Whether it's a mistake because of equipment or operator error, the voter made a mistake, the bottom line is it wasn't accurate.
[01:51:56.763 --> 01:52:00.429]  I mean, it feels like, you know, we could pick an American Idol.
[01:52:01.312 --> 01:52:03.653]  More accurately than we can a president.
[01:52:04.094 --> 01:52:11.017]  And if people can't trust the system and can't trust the process, whether it was operator error or technical mistakes, it's wrong.
[01:52:11.618 --> 01:52:16.160]  And when people can't trust their election process, then what the heck are we doing?
[01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:26.466]  It's just not fair, it's not right, it's not accurate, and it fuels a lot of speculation and frustration and just a basic lack of trust in the system itself.
[01:52:27.168 --> 01:52:27.969]  It was pretty interesting.
[01:52:27.989 --> 01:52:29.731]  I was listening to some of your audio clips this morning.
[01:52:29.751 --> 01:52:35.037]  I remember a caller calling in saying that last week his grandmother came in and voted.
[01:52:35.057 --> 01:52:35.597]  Tell me about that.
[01:52:35.658 --> 01:52:36.699]  Yeah, he called in.
[01:52:36.759 --> 01:52:46.029]  His grandmother had a problem voting last week, an older lady, and had some trouble with the equipment in the voting booth with this new digital and high-tech way that we're voting nowadays.
[01:52:46.570 --> 01:52:48.392]  And I bet that happens a lot.
[01:52:48.692 --> 01:52:55.898]  All across the country, you know, the older folks that are just not used to the equipment and the technology, and they don't know they should check it before they leave.
[01:52:56.358 --> 01:53:07.848]  And it's very possible that we've had, you know, hundreds, hundreds of thousands of people across this country in this election and in previous elections, where what they thought they were voting on just didn't come out in the end.
[01:53:08.128 --> 01:53:09.769]  It just wasn't accurate for them.
[01:53:09.809 --> 01:53:11.451]  And therefore, their vote didn't count.
[01:53:12.111 --> 01:53:20.373]  It counted for somebody else or something else, and this is true not just in political races, but bond package races, you know, various things we vote on at the polls.
[01:53:21.033 --> 01:53:22.013]  Well, there you have it.
[01:53:22.293 --> 01:53:26.715]  At the end of the day, whoever you're voting for, check the ballot.
[01:53:26.755 --> 01:53:32.576]  Make sure you're getting what it is you're voting for, and if not, bring it to the attention of the people working there.
[01:53:32.856 --> 01:53:36.377]  Whether this is a scam, this is a computer glitch, or
[01:53:37.037 --> 01:53:38.518]  This is personal error.
[01:53:38.938 --> 01:53:44.981]  Make sure that you get the person you want so we don't have the wrong person in charge of our country.
[01:53:45.262 --> 01:53:47.403]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[01:53:47.743 --> 01:53:50.805]  That's right, and some purists say, oh, don't vote, it's all a fraud.
[01:53:50.865 --> 01:53:57.428]  We vote to show where the frauds are, to keep them honest, and to ferret out what's happening, and that process is ongoing.
[01:53:57.448 --> 01:53:58.229]  You can't just give up.
[01:53:59.315 --> 01:54:03.536]  I'm gonna play the Jakari Jackson piece in the next, and it's even more revealing.
[01:54:04.496 --> 01:54:08.857]  So that is coming up, and then John McAfee is running for president.
[01:54:08.877 --> 01:54:09.437]  He's gonna be joining us.
[01:54:09.918 --> 01:54:10.998]  I got some really bad news.
[01:54:11.038 --> 01:54:12.078]  You knew it was gonna be happening.
[01:54:12.738 --> 01:54:15.259]  I'm gonna try to get Roger Stone to pop on today to talk about this.
[01:54:15.559 --> 01:54:16.699]  This just broke CNN.
[01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:21.900]  Mitt Romney to speak on State of the 2016 Presidential Race tomorrow.
[01:54:23.181 --> 01:54:23.781]  And the word is...
[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:30.083]  He's looking at throwing his hat into the ring, or he'll create a hysteria about is he gonna run.
[01:54:31.525 --> 01:54:33.626]  That's the equivalent of an internal third-party run.
[01:54:34.026 --> 01:54:45.976]  To bring him in, to make sure that the delegates are all broken up, where he gets 300, 400, 500, Trump only gets 300, 400, 500, the others get a couple hundred apiece, and then they can steal it from him.
[01:54:47.537 --> 01:54:51.400]  Or make Trump put Romney in as the VP, and then Trump gets shot like Reagan.
[01:54:52.452 --> 01:54:56.737]  Mitt Romney will speak Thursday on the state of the 2016 presidential race, he said, in a press release.
[01:54:56.757 --> 01:54:59.681]  The 2012 Republican nominee will speak at 11.30 a.m.
[01:54:59.761 --> 01:55:09.072]  Eastern Time, that's 12.30 tomorrow, we'll be covering it live, at the University of Utah's Hinckley Institute of Political Forum, the same day the remaining GOP presidential candidates are scheduled to debate in Detroit.
[01:55:11.311 --> 01:55:18.232]  Romney's remarks come at a time of deep soul-searching for the Republican establishment as they consider ways to take on front-runner Donald Trump, who dominated Super Tuesday.
[01:55:18.992 --> 01:55:23.433]  Oh, and they go on, "'cause of the Klan stuff," where he keeps repudiating and they keep saying he didn't.
[01:55:25.374 --> 01:55:27.614]  And again, they knew he repudiated more than 10 times.
[01:55:30.215 --> 01:55:36.736]  By the time Paul Ryan came out all angry at Trump and said, you better repudiate, hoaxing with CNN and Fox and MSNBC.
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:47.965]  These people are the trash of the earth and the Republicans that support them are the types that just want to feel like they're with a winner and part of the establishment and want their neighbors to think they're cool.
[01:55:48.225 --> 01:55:52.568]  You people are worse than Benedict Arnold, worse than the Tories at the founding of this country.
[01:55:52.868 --> 01:55:55.049]  You make me truly want to vomit!
[01:55:56.870 --> 01:56:03.494]  Every foreign globalist government, every world globalist leader like Larry Summers and all of them are against Trump.
[01:56:04.508 --> 01:56:07.670]  Because he's a nationalist and he's against unfair foreign trade deals.
[01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:11.292]  They go, oh, we don't want an isolationist, we don't want a protectionist.
[01:56:11.812 --> 01:56:15.995]  That's not what it is when China has internal tariffs on our goods and we don't.
[01:56:16.855 --> 01:56:19.077]  We don't have container ships going to China, literally.
[01:56:19.457 --> 01:56:20.978]  They come here by the thousands every month.
[01:56:21.718 --> 01:56:25.440]  Europe has had whole weeks now where they don't send anything here or us to them.
[01:56:26.881 --> 01:56:28.662]  Manufacturing is in cardiac arrest.
[01:56:28.902 --> 01:56:29.963]  We're falling apart.
[01:56:30.083 --> 01:56:31.204]  Can't we have anything?
[01:56:34.616 --> 01:56:35.316]  I'll tell you what I do do.
[01:56:35.356 --> 01:56:37.318]  We get almost all of our herbs right here in North America.
[01:56:37.338 --> 01:56:38.759]  Some of it comes from Russia and other areas.
[01:56:39.119 --> 01:56:43.822]  But at least we got jobs, and we manufacture here, and we produce here, and we package here, and we got jobs here.
[01:56:44.702 --> 01:56:51.887]  And I'm running specials on super high quality colloidal silver, Silver Bullet, and ForgedLife.com.
[01:56:52.547 --> 01:56:53.188]  50% off.
[01:56:53.348 --> 01:56:54.669]  It already has an incredibly low price.
[01:56:56.769 --> 01:56:57.830]  Now's the time to stock up.
[01:56:58.250 --> 01:57:01.893]  Anthroplex Male and Female Enhancement is back in.
[01:57:01.953 --> 01:57:04.154]  Works in synergy with Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[01:57:04.454 --> 01:57:05.075]  Read the reviews.
[01:57:05.115 --> 01:57:05.895]  It'll blow you away.
[01:57:06.336 --> 01:57:07.416]  Blocks the estrogen mimickers.
[01:57:07.457 --> 01:57:08.237]  There's so much more.
[01:57:08.377 --> 01:57:09.538]  And it supports the broadcast.
[01:57:10.439 --> 01:57:13.321]  We've already sold out of a bunch of items because of the big sale we had to stop.
[01:57:13.941 --> 01:57:15.402]  But Oxy Powder is selling out.
[01:57:15.482 --> 01:57:16.703]  Secret 12 is selling out.
[01:57:17.303 --> 01:57:18.885]  That's super high quality Vitamin B12.
[01:57:19.205 --> 01:57:20.266]  Lung Cleanse is selling out.
[01:57:20.346 --> 01:57:21.346]  Old Oregano is selling out.
[01:57:21.446 --> 01:57:22.367]  Occupower is selling out.
[01:57:22.687 --> 01:57:23.648]  Ancient Defense is selling out.
[01:57:23.928 --> 01:57:26.350]  They'll be sold out within days or some of them by next week.
[01:57:27.978 --> 01:57:30.559]  That's why I had to pull the sale, obviously, because we've got to have something left.
[01:57:30.599 --> 01:57:33.420]  Joint formula, all of it, InfoWarsLives.com.
[01:57:36.261 --> 01:57:37.021]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[01:57:37.101 --> 01:57:43.863]  But do yourself a favor and try the liver shield and with the Oxy-Powder together with the six-day liver and gallbladder cleanse.
[01:57:44.123 --> 01:57:48.705]  Do yourself a favor, try... Super Metal's sold out, so is Female, but try...
[01:57:50.506 --> 01:57:52.247]  Try something like the Anthroplex.
[01:57:53.007 --> 01:57:53.528]  It's amazing.
[01:57:54.268 --> 01:57:58.191]  I mean, it blows away leading enhancement for working out, libido, energy.
[01:57:59.091 --> 01:58:03.814]  Similar formulas that we know are old, dry herbs, not as good as ours, are $60 to $100.
[01:58:03.954 --> 01:58:12.219]  And for some reason, that's one form of marketing where people put stuff with a higher price, and then people buy it because it's the highest price.
[01:58:12.499 --> 01:58:14.040]  We're not following that metric.
[01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:15.661]  I will not karmically do that.
[01:58:16.348 --> 01:58:18.830]  I don't believe in all that, but the point is, I believe what you show.
[01:58:19.730 --> 01:58:20.491]  So, AutoShip.

[01:58:24.333 --> 01:58:25.874]  That's the most important point I forgot to make.
[01:58:26.294 --> 01:58:30.097]  We hold back enough, so nothing will ever be sold out if you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:58:30.457 --> 01:58:38.622]  We hold back extra, and you get 10% off on Oxy-Powder, Secret 12, Lung Cleanse, Oil Oregano, Oxy-Powder, Ancient Defense, Super Female, Super Male.

[01:59:03.657 --> 01:59:08.698]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:59:54.511 --> 01:59:59.096]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:07.784 --> 02:00:14.491]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[02:00:14.711 --> 02:00:16.813]  You better believe you've got one!
[02:00:18.996 --> 02:00:24.240]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:00:43.033 --> 02:00:45.214]  Sha'Carri Jackson for InfoWars.com.
[02:00:45.414 --> 02:00:50.877]  It's lunchtime and people are taking advantage of the opportunity to cast their ballots for the presidential nominees.
[02:00:51.177 --> 02:00:57.880]  So we're going to ask people who their favorite presidential candidates are and also if they've heard about the suspected voter fraud here in Austin, Texas.
[02:00:58.961 --> 02:01:01.182]  We're asking people who their favorite presidential candidate is.
[02:01:01.202 --> 02:01:02.582]  Any thoughts?
[02:01:03.083 --> 02:01:04.123]  I keep it to myself.
[02:01:04.143 --> 02:01:04.823]  Keep it to yourself.
[02:01:05.264 --> 02:01:06.584]  Sir, favorite presidential candidate?
[02:01:06.624 --> 02:01:06.824]  Ted Cruz.
[02:01:07.185 --> 02:01:07.625]  Ted Cruz.
[02:01:07.765 --> 02:01:08.125]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:08.285 --> 02:01:09.306]  What do you like about Ted Cruz?
[02:01:09.546 --> 02:01:09.926]  Everything.
[02:01:10.526 --> 02:01:11.967]  He's a constitutionalist.
[02:01:13.172 --> 02:01:14.233]  Uh, he'll do what he says.
[02:01:15.134 --> 02:01:15.554]  Alright, sir.
[02:01:15.955 --> 02:01:17.036]  Have you heard about the reports?
[02:01:17.096 --> 02:01:22.221]  People are calling in to KLBJ, the local radio station, and they're saying that they have some ballots switching.
[02:01:22.261 --> 02:01:24.443]  They put down one name, when they get the ballot back, it has another.
[02:01:24.803 --> 02:01:25.403]  Yeah, I've heard that.
[02:01:25.904 --> 02:01:26.905]  Does that concern you at all?
[02:01:27.225 --> 02:01:27.485]  Yeah.
[02:01:28.386 --> 02:01:28.626]  Yeah.
[02:01:29.848 --> 02:01:33.111]  Like, uh, you're talking about at the polling places, ballots getting switched?
[02:01:33.251 --> 02:01:33.571]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:33.831 --> 02:01:34.552]  Electronically?
[02:01:34.832 --> 02:01:35.132]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:35.793 --> 02:01:36.654]  You know, I don't doubt it.
[02:01:37.529 --> 02:01:38.189]  That bothers me.
[02:01:38.869 --> 02:01:41.270]  Mrs. Clinton, what's your favorite policy from Mrs. Clinton?
[02:01:41.770 --> 02:01:46.291]  I just think she has the most experience of all the people who are running.
[02:01:47.331 --> 02:01:56.533]  And I think she would be, she's worked hard for children, for schools, and I think our nation is failing in terms of its education for everyone.
[02:01:56.773 --> 02:01:58.413]  You have reports of ballot switching.
[02:01:58.453 --> 02:02:01.714]  People are calling in to KLBJ saying that they have their ballot switched.
[02:02:01.874 --> 02:02:03.014]  Does that concern you at all, miss?
[02:02:03.294 --> 02:02:08.477]  It angers me that it's even possible, and it worries me that people think it's possible.
[02:02:10.238 --> 02:02:14.900]  Sometimes rumors have a basis for belief, and so, yeah, that's troubling.
[02:02:16.121 --> 02:02:19.502]  I hope whoever can get in to stop that, stops that.
[02:02:19.602 --> 02:02:22.284]  We do not need fraud anywhere, anytime.
[02:02:23.504 --> 02:02:28.507]  And I appreciate, you know, whoever is out there fighting to keep the process honest.
[02:02:28.527 --> 02:02:30.428]  What are you guys liking the next presidential election?
[02:02:31.724 --> 02:02:32.525]  I like John Kasich.
[02:02:32.925 --> 02:02:33.365]  John Kasich?
[02:02:33.405 --> 02:02:33.606]  Yep.
[02:02:34.146 --> 02:02:35.127]  Okay.
[02:02:35.287 --> 02:02:37.969]  He's from my hometown and he's also very practical.
[02:02:38.590 --> 02:02:45.335]  So, um, he's not, you know, uh, doesn't throw a lot of frills out there and I think he's no-nonsense.
[02:02:45.355 --> 02:02:46.376]  Who do you want to attack, Russia?
[02:02:46.416 --> 02:02:47.777]  Well, Carson.
[02:02:48.198 --> 02:02:48.618]  Ben Carson.
[02:02:48.818 --> 02:02:50.299]  Okay, so why do you like Ben Carson?
[02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:56.985]  Because he's got the Christian perspective.
[02:02:58.118 --> 02:03:06.085]  But I know he's not going to win, so my next favorite is Rubio, because I think he really knows what's going on.
[02:03:06.425 --> 02:03:08.287]  Next president, Bernie Sanders!
[02:03:08.347 --> 02:03:09.528]  Bernie, so you feeling the Bern?
[02:03:09.668 --> 02:03:10.489]  I'm feeling it.
[02:03:10.509 --> 02:03:16.454]  I hope we have that much of a possibility in the United States to turn back all the crap.
[02:03:16.754 --> 02:03:17.274]  Can I say that?
[02:03:17.354 --> 02:03:17.975]  You say whatever you want.
[02:03:19.275 --> 02:03:24.557]  That's been going on, and, you know, have somebody who's really committed to change.
[02:03:24.577 --> 02:03:34.441]  I mean, I don't know if a president can do anything anyway, but if he can, or she can, and I would love there to be a woman, but I gotta respect her, and I don't respect Ms.
[02:03:34.961 --> 02:03:35.302]  Clinton.
[02:03:35.762 --> 02:03:38.443]  Can I ask you who your favorite presidential candidates are?
[02:03:40.350 --> 02:03:41.510]  Hillary Clinton.
[02:03:41.631 --> 02:03:42.151]  Like Hillary?
[02:03:42.411 --> 02:03:43.031]  Yes.
[02:03:43.171 --> 02:03:46.072]  Quite honestly, I love both of them for different reasons.
[02:03:46.152 --> 02:03:48.632]  I think they'll both be fantastic, whichever one wins.
[02:03:49.073 --> 02:03:49.853]  Bernie or Hillary?
[02:03:50.333 --> 02:03:50.913]  Bernie or Hillary.
[02:03:50.953 --> 02:03:51.933]  Feeling the Bern, OK.
[02:03:52.654 --> 02:03:53.434]  Donald J. Trump.
[02:03:53.454 --> 02:03:55.914]  Well, I'll tell you, sir, I don't know if you heard the reports.
[02:03:55.954 --> 02:03:57.575]  People are calling in to KLBJ.
[02:03:57.975 --> 02:03:59.856]  They're saying that their ballots have been switched.
[02:03:59.916 --> 02:04:01.596]  They wrote down Trump when they got it back.
[02:04:01.776 --> 02:04:02.676]  It had Rubio on it.
[02:04:02.816 --> 02:04:04.857]  Same thing happened to me several years back.
[02:04:06.147 --> 02:04:11.148]  I voted all Republican, and at the end of the machine it said I voted Democrat.
[02:04:12.309 --> 02:04:15.970]  And they turned the machine back, and sure enough, I voted Republican.
[02:04:16.030 --> 02:04:18.830]  And they said, well, we're having trouble with these machines.
[02:04:18.971 --> 02:04:20.151]  Matter of fact, it was right here.
[02:04:20.171 --> 02:04:20.891]  Yeah?
[02:04:21.251 --> 02:04:21.451]  Yeah.
[02:04:21.751 --> 02:04:24.572]  Is there any kind of remedy for that, that you know of?
[02:04:26.593 --> 02:04:28.153]  It's just everything's out of control.
[02:04:29.233 --> 02:04:30.194]  It's all deceitful.
[02:04:30.234 --> 02:04:31.294]  Everything's deceitful.
[02:04:32.734 --> 02:04:35.275]  Tell you what, Donald Trump?
[02:04:37.051 --> 02:04:38.031]  I'm not building a fence.
[02:04:39.692 --> 02:04:43.794]  Tell him that the wall just got 10 feet taller.
[02:04:43.914 --> 02:04:47.495]  Okay, tell him that.
[02:05:02.082 --> 02:05:07.465]  We are quickly approaching the five-year anniversary of Osama Bin Laden's supposed death at the hands of Navy SEALs.
[02:05:07.605 --> 02:05:14.468]  And to commemorate this, the Obama administration released 113 documents that were seized in the May 2nd, 2011 raid.
[02:05:14.768 --> 02:05:21.752]  And if you read the myriad of articles at Daily Mail, he supposedly writes he wants to leave his vast multi-million dollar fortune to the global jihad.
[02:05:21.952 --> 02:05:24.493]  He also worried that his wife had been implanted with a tracking chip.
[02:05:24.693 --> 02:05:27.054]  But he doesn't sign any of the documents in his name.
[02:05:27.254 --> 02:05:32.875]  He signs one, Saeed bin Usama, another, Usama bin Muhammad, and another, Abu Abdallah.
[02:05:33.076 --> 02:05:37.197]  But I ask, why didn't he use his CIA codename of Tim Osman in any of these letters?
[02:05:37.557 --> 02:05:41.758]  Remember, it was C. Bell Edmonds, the FBI translator, who broke a gag order and said that the U.S.
[02:05:41.798 --> 02:05:43.979]  had been working with Osama bin Laden right up until 9-11.
[02:05:44.659 --> 02:05:47.482]  And they were outsourcing him to conduct terror operations all over the world.
[02:05:47.742 --> 02:05:48.603]  There's one final note.
[02:05:48.643 --> 02:05:52.026]  He was calling on Americans to help President Obama fight climate change.
[02:05:52.246 --> 02:05:57.971]  So using liberal logic, if you don't disavow climate change, then you were for Osama bin Laden.
[02:05:58.271 --> 02:06:01.054]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:06:01.701 --> 02:06:06.042]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male and then when Super Female came out, tell us what happened.
[02:06:06.342 --> 02:06:10.963]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:06:11.103 --> 02:06:12.123]  Talk about the effects.
[02:06:12.443 --> 02:06:13.924]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:06:13.944 --> 02:06:15.564]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:06:15.884 --> 02:06:16.924]  I feel like I look better.
[02:06:16.984 --> 02:06:17.624]  I feel better.
[02:06:17.704 --> 02:06:18.725]  I feel sexier.
[02:06:18.745 --> 02:06:19.465]  I love it.
[02:06:19.725 --> 02:06:22.645]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[02:06:22.705 --> 02:06:25.406]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[02:06:25.646 --> 02:06:26.666]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:06:26.706 --> 02:06:27.747]  Consult your physician.

[02:06:53.277 --> 02:06:54.157]  I've been working all day.
[02:06:54.177 --> 02:06:56.238]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[02:06:56.258 --> 02:06:57.138]  I get in here at 830.
[02:06:57.218 --> 02:06:58.179]  I was kind of run down.
[02:06:58.279 --> 02:07:00.659]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[02:07:19.085 --> 02:07:20.946]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[02:07:20.966 --> 02:07:22.787]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[02:07:22.807 --> 02:07:23.587]  I popped two of them.
[02:07:23.867 --> 02:07:26.009]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:27.829]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[02:07:27.930 --> 02:07:29.390]  It's got four and a half stars.
[02:07:29.590 --> 02:07:30.631]  People really love it.

[02:07:40.796 --> 02:07:44.698]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[02:07:44.858 --> 02:07:50.661]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[02:07:51.001 --> 02:07:56.924]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:12.333 --> 02:08:16.259]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:19.023]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:36.337 --> 02:08:36.817]  Welcome back.
[02:08:36.858 --> 02:08:37.818]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:08:37.838 --> 02:08:40.320]  We'll be going to your phone calls, talking election 2016.
[02:08:40.821 --> 02:08:41.722]  John McAfee's our guest.
[02:08:41.742 --> 02:08:42.402]  We're about to go to him.
[02:08:42.422 --> 02:08:44.284]  Adam in Minnesota, you're up next.
[02:08:44.364 --> 02:08:50.910]  And we'll go to Bruce and Greg and Craig and Mike and everybody else.
[02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:55.153]  We'll intersperse the news, cover the waterfront with John McAfee.
[02:08:55.954 --> 02:08:58.136]  Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura is joining us Friday.
[02:08:58.196 --> 02:08:59.557]  He's saying he's going to throw his hat in the ring.
[02:08:59.577 --> 02:09:01.479]  You have Marco Rubio.
[02:09:03.441 --> 02:09:05.624]  Or if Hillary is the presumptive as well.
[02:09:05.644 --> 02:09:09.068]  He is a Trump fan as he knows him personally and says he's the real deal.
[02:09:09.368 --> 02:09:10.870]  Doesn't mean he agrees with everything he's saying.
[02:09:11.671 --> 02:09:15.015]  I'm glad John McAfee's running because he can always get media attention.
[02:09:15.035 --> 02:09:19.201]  He's an interesting fellow obviously in a smart guy on computer systems.
[02:09:20.302 --> 02:09:23.543]  But he's running also for president to help expose what's going on and happening.
[02:09:23.563 --> 02:09:27.105]  And he's been since day one talking about what's happening with the Apple phone and the rest of it.
[02:09:27.525 --> 02:09:30.126]  Of course, the FBI just wants to set the case to get rid of all encryption.
[02:09:30.266 --> 02:09:31.487]  And they pretty much admit that now.
[02:09:31.507 --> 02:09:32.427]  It wasn't this one case.
[02:09:32.467 --> 02:09:33.848]  It was a total stunt.
[02:09:33.868 --> 02:09:35.709]  So McAfee's going to be here to talk about that with us.
[02:09:36.409 --> 02:09:37.710]  Here's really the big news.
[02:09:38.670 --> 02:09:52.931]  Mitt Romney to speak on state of the 2016 presidential race tomorrow and the word is he's going to say he's thinking about running to create all this hype and then he'll come in and get enough of the delegates to make sure that that's the master plan.
[02:09:54.042 --> 02:09:58.464]  To make sure that they get enough of the delegates that Donald Trump doesn't get half of them.
[02:09:58.725 --> 02:10:06.409]  Because if he doesn't get half in the Republican Party system at the convention, they can give it to basically whoever they want with the superdelegates they control.
[02:10:06.989 --> 02:10:10.071]  Trump sits at 365 at Super Tuesday delegates.
[02:10:10.971 --> 02:10:16.377]  And the other four candidates together respectively sit, excuse me, Trump is at 316.
[02:10:16.437 --> 02:10:18.098]  The other candidates together are at 365.
[02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:24.245]  So they now already have more than half of the delegates they intend to try to keep it.
[02:10:25.579 --> 02:10:28.661]  That way, going into this entire situation.
[02:10:29.581 --> 02:10:30.601]  So that is a big deal.
[02:10:31.662 --> 02:10:39.446]  And so, if you look at it, go to DrudgeReport.com, 7 and 7, brutal battle, bruise, dims Warren Hillary of Trump threat.
[02:10:40.286 --> 02:10:42.347]  Well, they know he's the big threat in the polls.
[02:10:42.387 --> 02:10:45.909]  They act like he can't be elected to manipulate weak-minded people.
[02:10:45.969 --> 02:10:50.471]  It's like, he's been saying he's against the Klan since 2001 when he left the Reform Party on his own.
[02:10:52.372 --> 02:10:52.632]  Because,
[02:10:54.124 --> 02:10:54.965]  David Duke got involved.
[02:10:55.205 --> 02:10:59.109]  And then he said it four times before they cut his audio off and he didn't hear what they said.
[02:10:59.129 --> 02:11:01.691]  And then he said it, what is it, six more times.
[02:11:02.953 --> 02:11:07.237]  And then last night in his press conference they said three times, three different reporters, why won't you decry the Klan?
[02:11:08.524 --> 02:11:09.325]  He said, I just did it again.
[02:11:09.645 --> 02:11:11.307]  Right after he decried it, another one said, why won't you decry it?
[02:11:11.327 --> 02:11:12.668]  He goes, I just decried it two minutes ago.
[02:11:13.348 --> 02:11:16.752]  That, in fact, we ought to go into his press conference and just get that and put that together.
[02:11:17.132 --> 02:11:25.520]  Because the spectacle of that, forget Trump, forget John McAfee, forget Jesse Ventura, forget Hillary Clinton, forget Alex Jones, forget Matt Drudge, forget the Easter Bunny.
[02:11:27.621 --> 02:11:28.843]  What is this tactic?
[02:11:29.824 --> 02:11:33.328]  Where forever they went, the NSA does not operate domestically when we knew it was.
[02:11:33.468 --> 02:11:38.374]  Or you can keep your doctor under Obamacare and it's totally secure and totally safe, it's a giant screw job.
[02:11:39.896 --> 02:11:41.798]  Or all this election fraud that's going on.
[02:11:43.460 --> 02:11:44.521]  Who is McAfee.com?
[02:11:44.661 --> 02:11:45.702]  It's one of his websites.
[02:11:46.063 --> 02:11:48.325]  McAfee, M-C-A-F-E-E, 2016.com.
[02:11:50.629 --> 02:12:12.019]  FutureTenseCentral.com, I'm not going to go over his whole background at NASA, and an engineer, and a computer pioneer, and the inventor of the most popular software for antivirus ever, or his legendary escape being made into three major motion pictures and two or three other TV shows right now out of Belize, or the fact that he claimed it was riots and terrorists and Muslim radicals coming into the U.S.
[02:12:12.039 --> 02:12:12.819]  with fake passports.
[02:12:13.579 --> 02:12:15.440]  I actually said I didn't believe that at the time.
[02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:17.241]  I mean, I said, I don't think you're a liar, but this is too crazy.
[02:12:17.681 --> 02:12:18.822]  This is right when he got out
[02:12:19.582 --> 02:12:19.982]  I don't know.
[02:12:40.393 --> 02:12:40.753]  I don't know.
[02:12:41.293 --> 02:12:47.396]  Captain Morgan meets another swashbuckler, let's say, from the future, Han Solo.
[02:12:47.736 --> 02:12:49.577]  It's good to have you with us, Mr. McAfee.
[02:12:51.118 --> 02:12:51.618]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:12:51.658 --> 02:12:52.398]  I'm glad to be here.
[02:12:52.418 --> 02:13:02.963]  And I know you're a Trump supporter, and I regret to say that when I come out of the gates as the Libertarian nominee in May, I will mop the floor with Donald Trump.
[02:13:03.003 --> 02:13:04.703]  My apologies, sir, but that's just the way it is.
[02:13:04.743 --> 02:13:05.444]  Hey, let me be clear.
[02:13:06.244 --> 02:13:15.767]  Let me be clear, you're such a maverick and a real wild man, I want an Ace of Spades in there that'll trump, pun intended, the establishment's globalist takeover.
[02:13:16.207 --> 02:13:18.388]  So, if you had a big shot of winning, I'd be for it.
[02:13:18.408 --> 02:13:19.709]  Maybe as a libertarian, you will.
[02:13:20.109 --> 02:13:22.109]  You're going to get liberals and conservatives and libertarians.
[02:13:22.570 --> 02:13:30.252]  All I'm saying is, separate from that, your quotes on Trump, if you want to say he's bad, he's fine, go ahead, but isn't he scaring the whole power structure?
[02:13:30.512 --> 02:13:31.332]  Isn't that refreshing?
[02:13:32.633 --> 02:13:35.654]  It is, absolutely, and I hope I actually make it to the election.
[02:13:36.552 --> 02:13:44.120]  Yesterday, on CNN, I debated the FBI rep, Mr. James Gordon, a very slick gentleman.
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:54.269]  Actually, he's a goon, but a gentleman from the FBI, on their attempt to force Apple to put a master key in their software.
[02:13:55.086 --> 02:14:15.532]  And, uh, I've been trashing the FBI and the NSA for the past week, and I claimed in Business Insider that the, um, that the NSA, by forcing a backdoor on a piece of software illegally, by planting a programmer, um, in, uh, a major computer manufacturer, allowed the government to be hacked by foreign agents because the foreign agents got that backdoor.
[02:14:15.572 --> 02:14:22.774]  So, I fully expect any moment my door to be burst in and, and a joint, uh, FBI, uh, NSA... So, let's be clear, you're saying you've released some classified info?
[02:14:24.264 --> 02:14:24.504]  I did.
[02:14:24.524 --> 02:14:24.844]  Yes, sir.
[02:14:25.124 --> 02:14:25.385]  I did.
[02:14:25.985 --> 02:14:27.025]  And it was absolutely true.
[02:14:27.786 --> 02:14:32.067]  It was first released by Anonymous, but totally verified through a number of different agencies.
[02:14:32.087 --> 02:14:33.088]  Well, we know this keeps happening.
[02:14:33.108 --> 02:14:41.712]  It's why Apple aren't saints, but they're saying, we put back doors in, everyone's going to get them, and then we're going to be a crap platform like PC.
[02:14:43.271 --> 02:14:48.493]  Well, the FBI agent last night had the nerve, Alex, to say, we are trying to protect you.
[02:14:48.934 --> 02:14:52.235]  You have to give up privacy and personal freedoms in order to get that.
[02:14:52.435 --> 02:14:57.178]  It's like saying, someday you may be raped, so we're going to gang rape you with 300, you know, men.
[02:14:58.818 --> 02:14:59.299]  Absolutely.
[02:14:59.339 --> 02:15:04.121]  So, so, but I think by the end of that interview, I had, I had completely trashed him.
[02:15:05.642 --> 02:15:12.285]  My first interview on RT about the Apple FBI thing got over a half million views on my YouTube channel.
[02:15:12.345 --> 02:15:13.946]  I want to get into you're the computer expert.
[02:15:13.986 --> 02:15:15.647]  I want to hear what you think about this Obamacare.
[02:15:15.687 --> 02:15:18.448]  I'm supporting you for president because you'll educate folks.
[02:15:18.488 --> 02:15:19.829]  I just hope you don't take too much away from Trump.
[02:15:20.009 --> 02:15:20.969]  But I support both of you.
[02:15:21.029 --> 02:15:21.889]  I support Mavericks.
[02:15:22.190 --> 02:15:23.630]  That doesn't mean I got to support one person.
[02:15:23.650 --> 02:15:24.470]  I mean that's why you're on.
[02:15:24.791 --> 02:15:26.431]  But getting into Trump, it's newsworthy.
[02:15:26.751 --> 02:15:29.673]  Give us your take on Donald Trump and why you say you're gonna mop the floor with him.
[02:15:29.933 --> 02:15:30.313]  John McAfee.
[02:15:30.814 --> 02:15:37.203]  I'll mop the floor with whoever is the Democratic nominee versus Alex because they deserve to be mopped with.
[02:15:38.424 --> 02:15:39.466]  But there are a couple of things.
[02:15:40.387 --> 02:15:41.188]  I like Trump.
[02:15:41.208 --> 02:15:47.517]  Trump is a nice guy and he certainly galvanized and solidified a massive base of Americans.
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:53.263]  Uh, but there's certain things that, yeah, he wants to build his wall and build it higher, but look at the truth of this, Alex.
[02:15:53.283 --> 02:16:00.588]  You're wanting to build a wall between our country and a nation of the finest tunnel builders on the planet.
[02:16:01.028 --> 02:16:01.988]  This is the facts of it.
[02:16:02.048 --> 02:16:03.589]  They'll make it obsolete overnight.
[02:16:03.649 --> 02:16:05.971]  I mean, it is a stunt him saying build a wall.
[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:07.080]  It is.
[02:16:07.761 --> 02:16:14.707]  Other than that, I mean, actually, I don't like the style of the politics in either the Democratic or the Republican Party.
[02:16:14.727 --> 02:16:21.533]  I mean, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are up there pointing fingers at each other about the way they apply their makeup before they do the debate.
[02:16:22.394 --> 02:16:24.495]  Honest to God, Alex, we have problems in this country.
[02:16:24.555 --> 02:16:27.098]  And Rubio's talking about Trump's wee-wee not being big.
[02:16:28.139 --> 02:16:28.559]  I'm sorry?
[02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:31.662]  Rubio's talking about Donald Trump's package.
[02:16:32.742 --> 02:16:33.762]  Yeah, right.
[02:16:33.802 --> 02:16:34.862]  His fingers are short and stubby.
[02:16:35.082 --> 02:16:35.423]  I agree.
[02:16:35.663 --> 02:16:37.203]  But both of them are doing the same thing.
[02:16:37.243 --> 02:16:46.485]  And so, honestly, do you think other nations in the world are respecting us by the way the Democrats and the Republicans are doing their political machine?
[02:16:46.565 --> 02:16:46.725]  No.
[02:16:46.985 --> 02:16:47.585]  I don't think so.
[02:16:47.805 --> 02:16:48.885]  We look like fools, Alex.
[02:16:49.165 --> 02:16:50.406]  And forget the other nations.
[02:16:51.046 --> 02:16:52.386]  I think the American people.
[02:16:52.726 --> 02:16:54.687]  You know, the fact that we are putting up with it.
[02:16:54.727 --> 02:16:56.267]  Why don't we demand some seriousness?
[02:16:56.307 --> 02:16:58.427]  I want to know what everybody stands for.
[02:16:58.787 --> 02:17:01.848]  What are you going to do about cyber security?
[02:17:02.308 --> 02:17:04.712]  About immigration, about the economy.
[02:17:05.052 --> 02:17:07.455]  What are you going to do about our bloated government?
[02:17:07.896 --> 02:17:10.880]  Almost four trillion dollars a year down the tubes.
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:15.146]  I mean, I've spent over 40 million dollars, paid over 40 million dollars in taxes in my life.
[02:17:15.845 --> 02:17:17.427]  I received nothing from that $40 million.
[02:17:17.507 --> 02:17:18.888]  I don't think you have either, Alex.
[02:17:19.188 --> 02:17:20.189]  What are we doing here?
[02:17:20.530 --> 02:17:21.591]  John, let's walk through it.
[02:17:21.691 --> 02:17:22.491]  Let's walk through it.
[02:17:22.872 --> 02:17:27.776]  Let's start out with the Apple situation on a clip of one of the FBI folks actually out there putting out this info.
[02:17:28.357 --> 02:17:30.799]  And I'm not here to even bash the FBI, but they're lying.
[02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:34.503]  They want Apple to make a piece of software, as you said, that doesn't exist.
[02:17:34.923 --> 02:17:37.686]  Isn't that indentured servitude and sets an incredible precedent?
[02:17:38.561 --> 02:17:40.724]  Yes, it's a violation of the 13th Amendment.
[02:17:40.744 --> 02:17:45.009]  But beyond that, Alex, what they're asking for is a master key when they don't need one.
[02:17:45.249 --> 02:17:47.512]  They just have one phone that says, please give us the information.
[02:17:47.992 --> 02:17:51.256]  I offered to do it for the FBI for free, assuming they could not.
[02:17:51.657 --> 02:17:56.783]  And I did it on CNN, on CNBC, on CBS, on Larry King Live.
[02:17:57.203 --> 02:18:01.546]  On RT, I wrote an article for Business Insider that had 2 million readers.
[02:18:01.867 --> 02:18:03.127]  And I said, I'll do this for free.
[02:18:03.208 --> 02:18:05.269]  And explain to people, you just go around it.
[02:18:05.289 --> 02:18:06.370]  You don't go through the encryption.
[02:18:06.390 --> 02:18:11.413]  And for those that don't know or understand this, they can also get the data from the phone company and the ISP.
[02:18:11.634 --> 02:18:13.035]  So it's a total red herring from the FBI.
[02:18:14.131 --> 02:18:14.611]  Completely.
[02:18:14.751 --> 02:18:24.117]  And James Comey lied under oath to Congress yesterday when they asked him directly, have you contacted everybody who has offered assistance with this problem?
[02:18:24.538 --> 02:18:32.242]  Well, if he didn't know I've offered assistance, then he's either living in a barn or the people working for him have not notified him.
[02:18:32.262 --> 02:18:36.225]  Because I had a discussion with an FBI agent last night where I said,
[02:18:36.845 --> 02:18:40.009]  Your director lied under oath to Congress.
[02:18:40.410 --> 02:18:41.471]  No one contacted me.
[02:18:41.891 --> 02:18:45.856]  And if he did not know that I was offering assistance, then I'm not believing it, Alex.
[02:18:46.156 --> 02:18:47.558]  The rest of the world sure as hell knew.
[02:18:47.578 --> 02:18:50.661]  You were on every news channel out there.
[02:18:50.681 --> 02:18:51.102]  It was huge.
[02:18:52.264 --> 02:18:56.248]  Yes, so he lied under oath to Congress.
[02:18:56.269 --> 02:18:58.711]  Now that's how badly they want this key, Alex.
[02:18:58.952 --> 02:19:03.276]  Now, lying under oath to Congress, it doesn't matter why you're lying, it's a serious penalty.
[02:19:03.477 --> 02:19:08.782]  They don't want to get warrants to go to the phone company, the ISP, or have computer people break up on the phones individually.
[02:19:09.003 --> 02:19:12.507]  They want the master quick key to do it remotely to millions of phones at once.
[02:19:13.474 --> 02:19:16.536]  It's not remotely necessarily, but this is the beginning, Alex.
[02:19:16.596 --> 02:19:22.220]  If they give them the key to break into every iPhone on the planet, the next they're going to go to Google.
[02:19:22.340 --> 02:19:26.062]  And they'll say, we want to do the same thing with Android, which is 95% of the market.
[02:19:26.403 --> 02:19:29.925]  And the next thing you know, we have no safety, we have no privacy, we have no security.
[02:19:30.565 --> 02:19:36.229]  And, once you've given that key, or created that key, the FBI can't keep it, like I brought out last night.
[02:19:36.649 --> 02:19:43.713]  One month ago, two 15-year-old boys hacked into the FBI and walked off with... Exactly, stay there, come back with that, exactly.
[02:19:43.733 --> 02:19:47.736]  You have a federal government with tens of millions of employees, full of foreign asset moles.
[02:19:48.656 --> 02:19:51.438]  Everything the feds have they give the communist Chinese everybody else.
[02:19:51.938 --> 02:19:53.259]  So why don't we just give the Apple?
[02:19:54.060 --> 02:19:55.241]  Key to the Chinese government.
[02:19:55.261 --> 02:19:56.001]  I mean, how about that?
[02:19:56.041 --> 02:20:03.706]  Cuz that's that's what the FBI is asking for John McAvee He's the expert coming right back and then your phone calls stay with us Are you looking to sell body armor?

[02:23:28.596 --> 02:23:30.957]  From the Robert Allen System, current returns not indicative of future results.
[02:23:31.587 --> 02:23:34.328]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[02:23:34.628 --> 02:23:37.249]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[02:23:37.270 --> 02:23:37.690]  Croix River.
[02:23:38.010 --> 02:23:40.011]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[02:23:40.251 --> 02:23:42.972]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[02:23:43.212 --> 02:23:43.732]  His excuse?
[02:23:44.092 --> 02:23:45.153]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[02:23:45.413 --> 02:23:46.694]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[02:23:47.034 --> 02:23:52.516]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[02:24:05.049 --> 02:24:14.117]  Here is the FBI Director James Comey testifying before Congress yesterday.
[02:24:31.324 --> 02:24:42.773]  Thank you for hosting this conversation and for helping us all talk about an issue that I believe is the hardest issue I've confronted in government, which is how to balance the privacy we so treasure.
[02:24:43.749 --> 02:24:49.830]  that comes to us through the technology that we love and also achieve public safety which we also all very much treasure.
[02:24:49.950 --> 02:24:58.131]  Two terrorists in the name of ISIL killed 14 people and wounded 22 others at a office gathering and left behind three phones.
[02:24:58.912 --> 02:25:05.193]  Two of which the cheaper models they smashed beyond use and the third was left locked.
[02:25:06.653 --> 02:25:11.954]  In any investigation is done competently the FBI would try to get access to that phone.
[02:25:12.853 --> 02:25:21.597]  It's important that it's a live, ongoing terrorism investigation, but in any criminal investigation, a competent investigator would try and use all lawful tools to get access to that device.
[02:25:22.177 --> 02:25:23.717]  There are no demons in this debate.
[02:25:24.278 --> 02:25:31.501]  The companies are not evil, the government's not evil, you have a whole lot of good people who see the world through different lenses, who care about things.
[02:25:32.321 --> 02:25:33.942]  All care about the same things, in my view.
[02:25:34.102 --> 02:25:34.842]  Sure, potentially.
[02:25:35.262 --> 02:25:41.445]  Because any decision of a court about a matter is potentially useful to other courts, which is what a precedent is.
[02:25:42.225 --> 02:25:50.392]  I happen to think, having talked to experts, there are technical limitations to how useful this particular San Bernardino technique will be, given how the phones have changed.
[02:25:50.732 --> 02:25:57.158]  But sure, other courts, other prosecutors, other lawyers for companies will look to that for guidance or to try and distinguish it.
[02:25:57.178 --> 02:25:58.979]  There's already a door on that iPhone.
[02:25:59.379 --> 02:26:03.483]  Essentially, we're asking Apple, take the vicious guard dog away, let us try and pick the lock.
[02:26:05.060 --> 02:26:13.688]  We're going to go back to James Clapper's comments and other people, you know, claiming that there is no NSA spying domestically and just, you know, other ridiculous lies.
[02:26:13.708 --> 02:26:14.308]  We have those clips.
[02:26:14.328 --> 02:26:15.289]  That's the longer segment.
[02:26:15.309 --> 02:26:16.290]  Your phone calls are coming up.
[02:26:16.610 --> 02:26:20.634]  John McAfee of McAfee2016.com running for president.
[02:26:20.694 --> 02:26:23.437]  Our guest is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:26:23.937 --> 02:26:30.543]  Technically, going through the lies there, he's either super ignorant, and then isn't qualified to be FBI Director, or he's lying to everyone.
[02:26:30.983 --> 02:26:32.104]  I'm not a computer person.
[02:26:32.144 --> 02:26:32.865]  I knew day one.
[02:26:33.105 --> 02:26:36.508]  They could go to the phone company, go to the ISP, get all the records of where they went.
[02:26:37.629 --> 02:26:40.832]  You claim something's smashed, it can be reconstructed, but this other phone isn't.
[02:26:41.512 --> 02:26:48.798]  And now they admit to Congress, no, we just want to make all the companies constantly give us the keys, or make keys, to all the encryption.
[02:26:49.039 --> 02:26:50.340]  I mean, this is such deception.
[02:26:51.698 --> 02:26:55.040]  Well, they're trying to make it an issue of privacy versus security.
[02:26:55.100 --> 02:26:56.861]  And privacy is certainly an issue.
[02:26:57.182 --> 02:26:59.863]  But I knew that's what they would say, so I never mentioned privacy.
[02:27:00.244 --> 02:27:09.450]  I talked about the insecurity they would create to the American citizens by making Apple create a master key, which is going to get into the public within a matter of weeks.
[02:27:09.870 --> 02:27:17.955]  And if the public has a master key, then while your daughter is showering, if her phone is on the console, the Chinese or black hat hackers can be watching her.
[02:27:17.975 --> 02:27:19.416]  They're going to steal our credit cards.
[02:27:19.796 --> 02:27:21.057]  They're emptying our bank accounts.
[02:27:21.097 --> 02:27:22.538]  They will steal our identities.
[02:27:22.858 --> 02:27:24.499]  This is what you're asking us to accept.
[02:27:25.037 --> 02:27:31.700]  And the FBI agent I was talking to last night kept repeating, well, you have to give up some privacy to get security.
[02:27:31.740 --> 02:27:33.541]  I said, sir, I haven't mentioned privacy.
[02:27:33.801 --> 02:27:44.446]  So he came prepared to talk about privacy, not about an issue which is far more urgent, which is he's making us far more insecure by asking Apple to do this.
[02:27:44.747 --> 02:27:45.487]  It is absurd.
[02:27:45.807 --> 02:27:51.810]  We're doing this to help you and make you secure, but now your entire lives are going to be monitored by the entire world?
[02:27:52.050 --> 02:27:53.691]  That's not making me any more secure, Alex.
[02:27:55.794 --> 02:27:59.638]  Imagine what will happen if master encryption keys start getting made.
[02:27:59.678 --> 02:28:02.461]  As Apple points out, they don't even have this to get into the phone itself.
[02:28:02.801 --> 02:28:04.523]  They just have it on the encryption for communication.
[02:28:05.324 --> 02:28:07.206]  This president said it's a Pandora's box.
[02:28:07.346 --> 02:28:08.887]  What is the FBI thinking?
[02:28:08.927 --> 02:28:15.434]  By the way, France has come out today and wants to fine Apple 1 million euros each time it refuses to decrypt an iPhone.
[02:28:17.096 --> 02:28:19.899]  Well, you know, this is the problem with politics.
[02:28:19.919 --> 02:28:23.583]  This is the problem with bureaucrats, is that everybody's seeking more and more power.
[02:28:24.103 --> 02:28:26.326]  And how can the FBI gain more power?
[02:28:26.626 --> 02:28:32.852]  It can gain more power, Alex, by knowing everything about everybody in America at all times.
[02:28:32.952 --> 02:28:34.134]  This is the power that they want.
[02:28:34.374 --> 02:28:35.795]  Well, I don't want them to have that power.
[02:28:35.955 --> 02:28:36.416]  I'm sorry.
[02:28:36.656 --> 02:28:37.397]  They don't deserve it.
[02:28:38.458 --> 02:28:43.485]  And it's unconstitutional, and it violates our own individual human rights.
[02:28:43.545 --> 02:28:43.905]  Sure, sure.
[02:28:44.005 --> 02:28:50.173]  I mean, I'm not a master computer hacker and programmer like you, white hat hacker, but you've hacked into governments, you name it, exposed what happened in Belize.
[02:28:51.454 --> 02:28:57.399]  Isn't it the apps and things like that is how people can still get these phones?
[02:28:57.739 --> 02:28:59.280]  And most apps have already been broken.
[02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:03.984]  And so if somebody has a bunch of apps, the FBI has systems to break into those apps.
[02:29:04.244 --> 02:29:06.606]  They've also worked with app companies to put back doors in.
[02:29:06.866 --> 02:29:08.608]  I mean, isn't this a red herring on top of that?
[02:29:09.753 --> 02:29:11.294]  Well, it's a huge red herring.
[02:29:11.534 --> 02:29:12.974]  They want the information on the one phone.
[02:29:13.314 --> 02:29:14.835]  I can hack into that one phone.
[02:29:15.195 --> 02:29:16.855]  It'll take me some time, okay?
[02:29:16.895 --> 02:29:18.236]  And it'll take a team of people.
[02:29:18.296 --> 02:29:21.537]  So it's not something everybody can use all the time to break into iPhones.
[02:29:21.957 --> 02:29:23.218]  However, I can do it.
[02:29:23.778 --> 02:29:25.098]  I believe the FBI can do it.
[02:29:25.158 --> 02:29:29.720]  Why can 10,000 people in the world not working for the FBI be able to get into that phone?
[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:31.140]  But they can't get into it.
[02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:32.401]  Get real, Alex.
[02:29:32.861 --> 02:29:35.482]  They don't really want just that one phone.
[02:29:35.562 --> 02:29:36.282]  They want the key.
[02:29:36.402 --> 02:29:36.942]  Give me the key.
[02:29:37.122 --> 02:29:39.283]  They're probably not even going to use it on that phone.
[02:29:39.623 --> 02:29:41.323]  The keys to the kingdom stay there.
[02:29:41.743 --> 02:29:43.384]  My friend John McAfee is our guest.
[02:29:43.444 --> 02:29:44.164]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:44.524 --> 02:29:47.965]  The tip of the spear is in FoeWars.com.
[02:29:48.005 --> 02:29:49.285]  The enemy doesn't like that site.
[02:29:49.586 --> 02:29:50.306]  Spread the word.
[02:29:51.366 --> 02:29:52.266]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.766 --> 02:29:54.367]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.287 --> 02:29:57.968]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.190 --> 02:30:07.576]  We are quickly approaching the five-year anniversary of Osama Bin Laden's supposed death at the hands of Navy SEALs.
[02:30:07.736 --> 02:30:14.583]  And to commemorate this, the Obama administration released 113 documents that were seized in the May 2nd, 2011 raid.
[02:30:14.883 --> 02:30:21.890]  And if you read the myriad of articles at Daily Mail, he supposedly writes he wants to leave his vast multi-million dollar fortune to the global jihad.
[02:30:22.090 --> 02:30:24.633]  He also worried that his wife had been implanted with a tracking chip.
[02:30:24.813 --> 02:30:27.174]  But he doesn't sign any of the documents in his name.
[02:30:27.374 --> 02:30:32.995]  He signs one, Saeed bin Usama, another, Usama bin Muhammad, and another, Abu Abdallah.
[02:30:33.195 --> 02:30:37.316]  But I ask, why didn't he use his CIA codename of Tim Osman in any of these letters?
[02:30:37.676 --> 02:30:41.877]  Remember, it was Seibel Edmonds, the FBI translator, who broke a gag order and said that the U.S.
[02:30:41.917 --> 02:30:44.098]  had been working with Osama bin Laden right up until 9-11.
[02:30:44.778 --> 02:30:47.599]  And they were outsourcing him to conduct terror operations all over the world.
[02:30:47.859 --> 02:30:48.739]  There's one final note.
[02:30:48.759 --> 02:30:52.181]  He was calling on Americans to help President Obama fight climate change.
[02:30:52.361 --> 02:30:58.043]  So using liberal logic, if you don't disavow climate change, then you were for Osama bin Laden.

[02:33:09.304 --> 02:33:12.809]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.027 --> 02:33:35.129]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:33:35.149 --> 02:33:35.650]  to 3 p.m.
[02:33:35.670 --> 02:33:36.591]  Central, we're here live.
[02:33:36.611 --> 02:33:38.693]  David Knight's hosting the fourth hour.
[02:33:38.913 --> 02:33:44.098]  Utah Sheriff says he will deputize every citizen if necessary to stop Forest Service abuse.
[02:33:45.039 --> 02:33:47.962]  Rubio claims he fought Trump to a draw.
[02:33:47.982 --> 02:33:52.246]  Talk about laugh out loud or is he hinting at a strategy?
[02:33:54.397 --> 02:33:58.120]  We're also going to get into a host of other big news and the election.
[02:33:58.980 --> 02:34:03.664]  Hopefully, he'll get to the clip, too, of Van Jones blowing up at people and race baiting on MSNBC.
[02:34:03.684 --> 02:34:04.544]  I haven't gotten to that yet.
[02:34:05.025 --> 02:34:08.167]  I want to go to the callers like Adam and others that have been holding about the election.
[02:34:08.207 --> 02:34:09.828]  McAfee, obviously, is a presidential candidate.
[02:34:10.229 --> 02:34:11.670]  He can speak to that, John McAfee.
[02:34:12.570 --> 02:34:16.313]  And he's getting into what's happening with the NSA, the FBI.
[02:34:18.612 --> 02:34:23.253]  We also have election fraud going on, classic hacking of voting machines.
[02:34:23.974 --> 02:34:32.076]  We have all over the country, we've interviewed election judges, witnesses, people that happen to at flips from Trump to Rubio or Cruz.
[02:34:32.396 --> 02:34:33.597]  And it's never the other way around.
[02:34:34.217 --> 02:34:35.737]  And we had callers calling in about that.
[02:34:35.757 --> 02:34:37.898]  So I want to go to your calls here in a few minutes with John McAfee.
[02:34:38.898 --> 02:34:44.140]  We also have a video with Richard Reeves saying most Sanders supporters say they'll go Trump instead.
[02:34:46.738 --> 02:34:54.942]  Getting into Trump, one of my biggest problems with him, and I imagine this is yours because we're on the same page together, is he doesn't know computers.
[02:34:54.962 --> 02:34:55.923]  I know people that know him.
[02:34:55.963 --> 02:34:58.564]  They say, no, he doesn't even really look at computers.
[02:34:58.704 --> 02:34:59.825]  Everything's printed off for him.
[02:35:00.265 --> 02:35:03.547]  He reads like six, seven, eight hours a day, but everything's printed for him.
[02:35:03.567 --> 02:35:05.148]  He didn't want to watch videos.
[02:35:05.168 --> 02:35:06.028]  He wants transcripts.
[02:35:06.048 --> 02:35:06.789]  He's a speed reader.
[02:35:08.350 --> 02:35:10.131]  And he's just like, they have a warrant.
[02:35:10.191 --> 02:35:10.751]  Let them in.
[02:35:10.791 --> 02:35:12.052]  He doesn't understand.
[02:35:12.572 --> 02:35:15.033]  So he needs to have somebody like you advising him if you don't win.
[02:35:15.053 --> 02:35:16.034]  And he does.
[02:35:17.813 --> 02:35:18.035]  But...
[02:35:19.552 --> 02:35:20.553]  He says things like that.
[02:35:20.613 --> 02:35:21.573]  He just doesn't understand.
[02:35:21.634 --> 02:35:23.094]  I'm not a tech guy, but I understand.
[02:35:23.935 --> 02:35:26.457]  And I understand the FBI is classically lying about this.
[02:35:26.517 --> 02:35:31.740]  And plus, the government's bringing in ISIS to attack us, and then saying, give our rights up, just like Europe's done.
[02:35:32.721 --> 02:35:34.742]  What else is important for folks to know about this?
[02:35:34.762 --> 02:35:35.843]  Because you've done this on TV.
[02:35:36.223 --> 02:35:37.284]  You can get into these phones.
[02:35:37.304 --> 02:35:38.344]  You can get into iPhones.
[02:35:39.865 --> 02:35:41.526]  I've talked to people with iPads and iPhones.
[02:35:41.566 --> 02:35:42.607]  I've talked to the Austin police.
[02:35:43.187 --> 02:35:48.251]  I know friends that have had their phones stolen, iPhones, and the police go, no, they've got fencers that know how to
[02:35:49.264 --> 02:35:50.184]  Basically get into it.
[02:35:51.485 --> 02:35:52.645]  And they usually get through apps.
[02:35:52.865 --> 02:35:54.526]  So I don't think it's 10,000 people that know.
[02:35:54.546 --> 02:35:55.566]  I think it's more than that.
[02:35:55.886 --> 02:35:57.467]  Especially if it's an older version.
[02:35:57.927 --> 02:35:59.467]  Because these hacks get online.
[02:35:59.507 --> 02:36:00.848]  Now you're one of the master hackers.
[02:36:00.868 --> 02:36:02.648]  You're well known as a computer guru.
[02:36:02.748 --> 02:36:06.750]  Am I layman's moving around in the dark here?
[02:36:06.770 --> 02:36:07.470]  Am I right or wrong?
[02:36:08.404 --> 02:36:09.265]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[02:36:09.625 --> 02:36:19.871]  Let me explain something extremely important which most of the American public and all of our government seems to have missed, Alex, and that is the next war is not going to be fought with nuclear weapons and battleships and airplanes.
[02:36:20.271 --> 02:36:27.395]  It will be a cyber war and it will be many times more devastating than anything imaginable in a nuclear war.
[02:36:27.835 --> 02:36:36.120]  A report to Congress last year by a group of cyber security professionals claimed that 90% of the American population would die.
[02:36:36.921 --> 02:36:37.081]  Yes.
[02:36:38.097 --> 02:36:40.558]  We'd perish in a cyber war with China.
[02:36:41.158 --> 02:36:41.979]  And why?
[02:36:42.039 --> 02:36:48.542]  Because China currently has the ability to destroy our entire power infrastructure.
[02:36:48.582 --> 02:36:52.764]  And our ships were built there, and they've been caught putting back doors even in defense ships.
[02:36:53.164 --> 02:36:59.707]  Why would our elite make everything smart, have us adopt it, the Chinese haven't, and then now we're wide open to a Skynet takeover?
[02:36:59.907 --> 02:37:00.928]  Because it's on purpose.
[02:37:01.823 --> 02:37:09.728]  Yes, of course, because the chips that we're using are right for all of our communication software is made by the Chinese and it's firmware.
[02:37:09.988 --> 02:37:12.030]  So we can't even see what's inside it, Alex.
[02:37:12.410 --> 02:37:13.851]  So the Chinese have back doors.
[02:37:13.891 --> 02:37:15.372]  They can shut down our communications.
[02:37:15.812 --> 02:37:25.598]  Last month, the Ukrainian power system was shut down for an entire day, the entire country, by two teenage hackers using a piece of software that was 35 years old.
[02:37:25.658 --> 02:37:27.840]  And the teenagers are also breaking into the FBI.
[02:37:28.735 --> 02:37:30.436]  And they broke into the FBI just last month.
[02:37:30.837 --> 02:37:38.803]  So, the Chinese have the ability to shunt our power in such a way that we burn out substation after substation until there's nothing left.
[02:37:39.103 --> 02:37:41.685]  And we will not have the power, Alex, to rebuild.
[02:37:41.705 --> 02:37:43.206]  But won't Hillary save us then?
[02:37:43.266 --> 02:37:45.828]  Because, I mean... I'm sorry?
[02:37:45.848 --> 02:37:46.729]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:37:47.289 --> 02:37:48.490]  Won't Hillary save us?
[02:37:48.530 --> 02:37:50.492]  Won't political correctness save us from that?
[02:37:53.234 --> 02:37:54.074]  Yeah, that was a good joke.
[02:37:54.355 --> 02:37:54.815]  No, it won't.
[02:37:55.342 --> 02:38:06.525]  We have to have someone who understands at least the fundamental science, the cyber science, that glues our entire society and our industry together, Alex, because everything is run on computers now.
[02:38:06.805 --> 02:38:10.386]  The reason we would all die if there were a cyber war is because we would starve to death.
[02:38:10.706 --> 02:38:12.507]  Without power, we can't run our computers.
[02:38:13.027 --> 02:38:18.268]  And computers, for example, control all food distribution in this country.
[02:38:18.628 --> 02:38:19.969]  We have no backups.
[02:38:20.009 --> 02:38:21.709]  We fired the people that used to do it.
[02:38:22.149 --> 02:38:24.650]  So if our computers are down, we don't get food distribution.
[02:38:25.109 --> 02:38:32.654]  In three weeks, the Walmart food stores and Safeway and every other food store in the country will run out of food.
[02:38:33.034 --> 02:38:33.875]  We can't distribute it.
[02:38:34.335 --> 02:38:45.763]  We cannot produce it because all the packaging... Why would our government, more than any other, wire everything in to be dependent and put back doors in it and buy chips from our enemies who've been caught, you know, having shut-off switches in the ICBMs?
[02:38:45.803 --> 02:38:49.205]  I mean, look, the globalists moved everything to China on purpose.
[02:38:49.245 --> 02:38:49.986]  They've double-crossed us.
[02:38:50.026 --> 02:38:50.606]  We've been sold out.
[02:38:50.646 --> 02:38:51.227]  We're being set up.
[02:38:52.366 --> 02:38:59.273]  Well, you're right, you're absolutely right, because nobody, seriously Alex, nobody, not even our government officials, could be that stupid.
[02:38:59.673 --> 02:39:01.875]  Exactly, why do they badmouth the founding fathers?
[02:39:01.935 --> 02:39:03.116]  Why do they badmouth families?
[02:39:03.417 --> 02:39:06.360]  Why do they badmouth people that are into patriotism and sovereignty?
[02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:14.127]  Because we've already been taken over, and they want a kill switch, a heart plug, to destroy the country if we don't play ball with the new world order.
[02:39:14.507 --> 02:39:15.809]  We have been totally taken over.
[02:39:16.833 --> 02:39:25.721]  The most horrific thing I heard in the interview with the FBI representative last night was he said, you have to give up freedom and privacy in order to get security.
[02:39:26.002 --> 02:39:28.924]  I was flabbergasted and shocked Alex, but that's the attitude.
[02:39:28.965 --> 02:39:32.348]  Those that give up liberty for security get neither.
[02:39:34.297 --> 02:39:34.817]  Absolutely.
[02:39:35.217 --> 02:39:37.239]  Ben Franklin, I think, was the first to say that.
[02:39:37.979 --> 02:39:38.780]  But absolutely.
[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:40.581]  But they don't really believe it.
[02:39:40.942 --> 02:39:42.243]  They want us to believe it.
[02:39:42.943 --> 02:39:45.685]  And they've already bought armored redoubts in other parts of the world.
[02:39:45.705 --> 02:39:46.886]  They're setting us up to be destroyed.
[02:39:47.827 --> 02:39:48.847]  They're actually foreign agents.
[02:39:49.088 --> 02:39:49.768]  I'm serious, folks.
[02:39:49.808 --> 02:39:50.489]  I'm not just saying that.
[02:39:50.929 --> 02:39:55.813]  We are totally run by enemies preparing us down the road to be nuked, shut down, you name it.
[02:39:55.853 --> 02:39:57.114]  I mean, we are gone.
[02:39:57.734 --> 02:39:58.115]  We are.
[02:39:58.135 --> 02:40:00.320]  Our borders are wide open, but they take our rights.
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:02.485]  They ship in radical Muslims, but they take our rights.
[02:40:02.505 --> 02:40:03.247]  We're wide open.
[02:40:03.728 --> 02:40:04.711]  Europe's going down too.
[02:40:04.771 --> 02:40:05.172]  It's over.
[02:40:05.452 --> 02:40:06.415]  This is World War IV.
[02:40:06.555 --> 02:40:07.617]  We were taken over by globalists.
[02:40:08.738 --> 02:40:14.200]  But, you know, we're still Americans, Alex, and I think the human spirit is indomitable and infinite, and we're not stupid.
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:14.860]  We're not.
[02:40:15.181 --> 02:40:19.862]  I mean, I tried to tell the FBI agent, the representative last night, you know, we aren't that stupid.
[02:40:19.962 --> 02:40:20.783]  Please, we're not.
[02:40:21.003 --> 02:40:22.263]  We're not going to buy it anymore.
[02:40:22.283 --> 02:40:23.604]  We're not going to listen to it anymore.
[02:40:23.704 --> 02:40:24.044]  I agree.
[02:40:24.104 --> 02:40:28.666]  Don't you think Trump is a manifestation of the anger and the revolution that's happening right now?
[02:40:29.890 --> 02:40:30.530]  Absolutely.
[02:40:31.010 --> 02:40:32.711]  He's angry, I'm angry, you're angry.
[02:40:32.751 --> 02:40:33.611]  We're all angry.
[02:40:34.291 --> 02:40:35.631]  We have to be angry.
[02:40:35.751 --> 02:40:36.931]  Look what has happened to us.
[02:40:37.212 --> 02:40:39.212]  Look what has been done to us by our government.
[02:40:39.592 --> 02:40:43.093]  Our government tells me that my body does not belong to me.
[02:40:43.433 --> 02:40:44.353]  It belongs to them.
[02:40:44.813 --> 02:40:46.393]  It tells me what I can put into it.
[02:40:46.773 --> 02:40:47.874]  What I can do with it.
[02:40:48.394 --> 02:40:53.415]  What new life-saving drugs, if I develop a terminal illness, I'm allowed or not allowed to take.
[02:40:53.715 --> 02:40:57.716]  Because if I'm a dying man, they're afraid that these drugs may harm me.
[02:40:57.956 --> 02:40:58.456]  My God!
[02:40:59.176 --> 02:41:00.538]  My body belongs to me, Alex.
[02:41:00.898 --> 02:41:01.999]  Your body belongs to you.
[02:41:02.019 --> 02:41:04.762]  Well, you have the right to kill yourself, though, but not treat yourself.
[02:41:05.983 --> 02:41:06.223]  Yes.
[02:41:06.524 --> 02:41:07.365]  Basically, that's it.
[02:41:07.945 --> 02:41:08.366]  Absolutely.
[02:41:08.406 --> 02:41:09.427]  What's that tell you about what you did?
[02:41:11.225 --> 02:41:12.826]  It's a horror that we're living in.
[02:41:12.886 --> 02:41:13.506]  It's a nightmare.
[02:41:13.526 --> 02:41:15.267]  But we need to wake up as Americans.
[02:41:15.327 --> 02:41:16.087]  And we can, Alex.
[02:41:16.127 --> 02:41:16.547]  We can.
[02:41:16.907 --> 02:41:17.548]  We are.
[02:41:17.708 --> 02:41:18.548]  I agree, John McAfee.
[02:41:18.588 --> 02:41:20.489]  I want to go to Kohl's here on the presidential race.
[02:41:20.509 --> 02:41:21.649]  You're an expert on hacking.
[02:41:22.209 --> 02:41:23.970]  You know, where they flip the numbers and the rest of it.
[02:41:23.990 --> 02:41:25.190]  I appreciate Adam holding.
[02:41:25.230 --> 02:41:26.311]  I appreciate Bruce holding.
[02:41:26.351 --> 02:41:31.693]  I appreciate Mike and Craig and Wilde and that order holding here on the air with John McAfee.
[02:41:31.713 --> 02:41:35.094]  And let me give everybody... Which one of the websites is the best to visit?
[02:41:35.454 --> 02:41:35.794]  McAfee2016.com, sir?
[02:41:39.043 --> 02:41:39.283]  2016.com.
[02:41:39.343 --> 02:41:42.544]  McAfee2016.com is my campaign website.
[02:41:42.884 --> 02:41:45.345]  We are up against the two major political parties.
[02:41:45.365 --> 02:41:46.246]  They are machines.
[02:41:46.626 --> 02:41:48.047]  They are vastly funded.
[02:41:48.447 --> 02:41:49.587]  We are a small organization.
[02:41:49.607 --> 02:41:51.168]  Do you think we'll get the Libertarian nomination?
[02:41:52.549 --> 02:41:53.969]  Absolutely not.
[02:41:54.089 --> 02:41:55.290]  There's no question in my mind.
[02:41:55.310 --> 02:41:59.772]  I mean, I'm sure there's a question in Governor Johnson's mind, but not in mine.
[02:42:00.072 --> 02:42:01.293]  What kind of dog is that back there?
[02:42:01.333 --> 02:42:01.853]  Is that a cat?
[02:42:03.709 --> 02:42:04.390]  It's a Commodore.
[02:42:04.410 --> 02:42:05.170]  It's a huge dog.
[02:42:05.210 --> 02:42:06.231]  I thought it was a huge dog.
[02:42:06.271 --> 02:42:08.293]  I just couldn't tell it was on a table right behind your back.
[02:42:09.014 --> 02:42:11.215]  What's the... About two feet away.
[02:42:11.476 --> 02:42:12.877]  What's the Commodore's name?
[02:42:15.739 --> 02:42:16.120]  Marley.
[02:42:16.860 --> 02:42:17.341]  Marley?
[02:42:17.981 --> 02:42:18.742]  We have four dogs.
[02:42:19.502 --> 02:42:20.724]  I have a sister named Marley.
[02:42:22.465 --> 02:42:22.785]  Marley!
[02:42:23.005 --> 02:42:23.286]  Marley!
[02:42:23.306 --> 02:42:23.766]  Come on over here!
[02:42:25.307 --> 02:42:26.749]  He's not going to pay attention to you.
[02:42:26.769 --> 02:42:28.150]  They're very independent dogs, Alex.
[02:42:28.170 --> 02:42:29.211]  You have some food, he'll come.
[02:42:30.111 --> 02:42:31.551]  If I had a rib or something, maybe.
[02:42:32.052 --> 02:42:32.812]  Marley, come on over here!
[02:42:33.612 --> 02:42:35.072]  Oh, look at the little Snoopys!
[02:42:35.572 --> 02:42:36.573]  That's a pit bull, right?
[02:42:37.733 --> 02:42:38.813]  One of them.
[02:42:38.853 --> 02:42:39.833]  That's a sheep dog, right?
[02:42:40.194 --> 02:42:40.654]  Your Commodore?
[02:42:40.674 --> 02:42:43.194]  Pit bull, Commodore, and a little mutt here.
[02:42:44.955 --> 02:42:45.715]  Oh, I like dogs.
[02:42:46.435 --> 02:42:47.836]  So you got four of those, sweethearts, huh?
[02:42:49.276 --> 02:42:50.056]  We have four of them, yep.
[02:42:50.296 --> 02:42:52.097]  Well, let's... A total weight of 350 pounds.
[02:42:54.116 --> 02:42:56.157]  They would make better presidents than Hillary.
[02:42:56.817 --> 02:42:58.138]  Of course, she is barking like a dog now.
[02:42:58.278 --> 02:43:00.419]  Adam in Minnesota, you're on the air with John McAfee.
[02:43:00.719 --> 02:43:02.981]  He's running for 2016 for the Libertarian nomination.
[02:43:03.001 --> 02:43:05.002]  Adam, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:43:06.522 --> 02:43:07.603]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:43:07.643 --> 02:43:08.623]  Hey there, Mr. McAfee.
[02:43:08.763 --> 02:43:15.907]  I actually just got an email from McAfee's spyware, so I should probably renew that with the free trial ending, but glad to be on with you guys.
[02:43:15.927 --> 02:43:19.469]  Yeah, McAfee hasn't been part of McAfee's company for decades.
[02:43:20.309 --> 02:43:21.430]  How long since you got out of McAfee?
[02:43:22.355 --> 02:43:26.783]  It's been 15 years or more, Alex, and when I had the company, the software was fantastic.
[02:43:26.823 --> 02:43:28.245]  As soon as I left, it went downhill.
[02:43:28.265 --> 02:43:30.649]  So I've had nothing to do with it for 15 years.
[02:43:31.110 --> 02:43:33.834]  Adam, what's your view on Super Tuesday and what you witnessed?
[02:43:35.276 --> 02:43:37.939]  Yeah, so I have a couple of two-part questions.
[02:43:37.979 --> 02:43:41.442]  First about the election and then the second part about the esoteric hive mind.
[02:43:41.482 --> 02:43:44.045]  And I actually kind of want to get McAfee's take on that as well.
[02:43:44.725 --> 02:43:49.690]  But yeah, with the election yesterday, I'm from Minnesota and surprisingly Rubio, his only winning was here.
[02:43:50.371 --> 02:43:54.655]  And I think it has to do with these mind games that the establishment plays through the media.
[02:43:55.015 --> 02:43:58.639]  You know, Marco Mentum and this KKK disavowing question.
[02:43:58.999 --> 02:43:59.239]  I think so.
[02:44:16.300 --> 02:44:20.262]  Cruz would have been out of the race, and I think he probably potentially did win Texas, did win Iowa.
[02:44:34.108 --> 02:44:35.511]  Proof going on all over the place.
[02:44:35.851 --> 02:44:39.478]  They're setting it up yet again because they're so scared of him.
[02:44:39.518 --> 02:44:46.691]  And how are we ever going to get a Libertarian elected, you know, if these two-party systems continue to engage in all this jury rigging?
[02:44:47.932 --> 02:44:53.836]  Well, you mentioned earlier, Alex, I think the press has a huge part in this whole issue.
[02:44:54.116 --> 02:44:58.519]  For example, you mentioned Donald Trump and his relationship to the KKK leader.
[02:44:58.839 --> 02:44:59.980]  They purposely set that up.
[02:45:00.020 --> 02:45:03.823]  He's many times before disavowed this gentleman, David Duke, many times.
[02:45:04.463 --> 02:45:09.046]  But they set this entire thing up so they could make it look like he was a KKK sympathizer.
[02:45:09.126 --> 02:45:13.229]  And then even though he disavows it 10, 14 times, they keep saying, why won't you disavow?
[02:45:13.489 --> 02:45:17.612]  In the same press conference last night, we got to put this together, three different reporters say disavow.
[02:45:18.252 --> 02:45:20.353]  He goes, well I already did disavow a bunch, but I disavow again.
[02:45:20.393 --> 02:45:22.913]  Next thing, why won't you disavow the KKK?
[02:45:23.013 --> 02:45:24.713]  I did just disavow, but okay, disavow again.
[02:45:24.994 --> 02:45:27.374]  Third guy, and he goes, wait a minute, when are you going to stop this?
[02:45:27.974 --> 02:45:29.995]  And see, they'll use that to say he didn't disavow.
[02:45:30.335 --> 02:45:35.956]  So McAfee, let me ask you now, as a joke, will you disavow the KKK even though you have nothing to do with it?
[02:45:38.556 --> 02:45:43.557]  I know no one within the KKK, at least to my knowledge, Alex, and I will definitely disavow the KKK.
[02:45:43.918 --> 02:45:45.738]  I'm against anybody... Hold on, why won't you disavow them?
[02:45:46.701 --> 02:45:47.081]  I'm sorry?
[02:45:47.101 --> 02:45:48.521]  Why won't you disavow him?
[02:45:50.282 --> 02:45:54.223]  Why do I?
[02:45:55.183 --> 02:45:55.723]  You get it now.
[02:45:55.863 --> 02:45:56.803]  Go ahead and disavow again.
[02:45:57.064 --> 02:45:57.944]  I've got the moral authority.
[02:45:58.664 --> 02:45:59.364]  Disavow again.
[02:46:01.104 --> 02:46:01.785]  My point made.
[02:46:01.845 --> 02:46:02.245]  You've got it.
[02:46:02.265 --> 02:46:03.185]  This is how it works, Alex.
[02:46:03.265 --> 02:46:04.665]  No, wait a minute.
[02:46:04.705 --> 02:46:05.546]  You won't disavow?
[02:46:05.566 --> 02:46:06.926]  Disavow!
[02:46:07.086 --> 02:46:07.926]  Say I disavow.
[02:46:10.127 --> 02:46:10.967]  My wife is black.
[02:46:11.007 --> 02:46:11.387]  How's that?
[02:46:11.487 --> 02:46:12.087]  No, no, no, no.
[02:46:12.147 --> 02:46:13.007]  Say I disavow.
[02:46:14.388 --> 02:46:15.288]  I disavow, Alex.
[02:46:15.914 --> 02:46:17.915]  Wait a minute, John McAfee, why won't you disavow?
[02:46:19.055 --> 02:46:20.816]  You're seeing him not disavow, folks!
[02:46:22.057 --> 02:46:25.018]  I'm going to ask you one more time or Paul Ryan's going to have to come out and give a speech.
[02:46:26.219 --> 02:46:28.360]  Now he's done it ten times by Paul Ryan's speech.
[02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:30.361]  He's done it over fourteen as of last night.
[02:46:30.381 --> 02:46:34.803]  I want you to disavow fourteen times and disavow the way I want.
[02:46:34.843 --> 02:46:35.203]  Go ahead.
[02:46:36.643 --> 02:46:39.024]  I want to just continue to say one phrase over and over.
[02:46:39.044 --> 02:46:39.785]  My wife is black.
[02:46:40.145 --> 02:46:40.865]  My wife is black.
[02:46:41.145 --> 02:46:44.327]  And if I keep saying that... Not good enough, say I disavow.
[02:46:47.625 --> 02:46:48.065]  Seriously!
[02:46:48.285 --> 02:46:48.465]  Right.
[02:46:48.565 --> 02:46:49.766]  Dick Duke is my best friend.
[02:46:50.046 --> 02:46:51.287]  We hang out together and drink beers.
[02:46:51.547 --> 02:46:54.908]  Now she actually... Okay, why won't you disavow the KKK?
[02:46:57.609 --> 02:47:04.913]  No, seriously, I'm gonna take this piece and edit it together with him disavowing over and over again, at the same press conference disavowing, and they go, why won't you disavow?
[02:47:05.133 --> 02:47:06.113]  It's that crazy!
[02:47:06.393 --> 02:47:07.834]  What are these people thinking, John?
[02:47:09.257 --> 02:47:15.360]  The ABC and NBC and CNN are going to take that cut where I said, David Duke is my best friend, and they're going to use that.
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:16.240]  You know this for a fact.
[02:47:16.260 --> 02:47:17.481]  This is how it works.
[02:47:17.721 --> 02:47:18.561]  This is just how it works.
[02:47:19.662 --> 02:47:22.123]  But you know the good news is people aren't buying it anymore, John.
[02:47:23.527 --> 02:47:24.067]  Yeah, we're not.
[02:47:24.087 --> 02:47:24.987]  We're getting smarter, Alex.
[02:47:25.007 --> 02:47:25.528]  We really are.
[02:47:25.608 --> 02:47:26.628]  Thank God for that.
[02:47:27.128 --> 02:47:33.890]  Or at least you can fool some of the people all of the time, all the people some of the time, but you just can't fool all of us forever.
[02:47:34.230 --> 02:47:37.111]  And we're getting smart, and we're looking through it, and we're seeing through this nonsense.
[02:47:37.531 --> 02:47:39.171]  The government wants to look into my life.
[02:47:39.431 --> 02:47:41.012]  No, I want to look into the government's life.
[02:47:41.072 --> 02:47:42.452]  It's our money that you're spending.
[02:47:42.752 --> 02:47:43.452]  How are you spending it?
[02:47:43.572 --> 02:47:44.573]  What are you doing with it?
[02:47:44.913 --> 02:47:45.493]  I want to know.
[02:47:45.613 --> 02:47:48.374]  Well, that makes a lot of sense, but you wouldn't disavow the KKK.
[02:47:52.478 --> 02:47:54.482]  Alright, hey Adam, anything else from Minnesota?
[02:47:55.784 --> 02:48:05.562]  Yeah, so the second part I had was about the esoteric knowledge you're talking about and something about eschatology, the study of end times, because honestly, when we do get to the rabbit hole and the father of all lies, the devil...
[02:48:06.389 --> 02:48:08.310]  We do see, you know, the coming of the Antichrist.
[02:48:08.930 --> 02:48:20.333]  And one big sign, I think, that people are not really realizing is that, you know, when they come in with these, you know, virtual realities and these alternative worlds for us to just kind of delve into and get sucked into.
[02:48:20.693 --> 02:48:24.495]  And really, I think what Drudge said about, you know, feeling the air, feeling the water is important.
[02:48:24.515 --> 02:48:28.876]  But when the Antichrist comes, he will come in the place of saying he is Jesus.
[02:48:29.781 --> 02:48:35.871]  That all the people around the world, the billions of Christians will flock to him and see that, you know, man, God being one and the same.
[02:48:36.352 --> 02:48:38.876]  But I think in terms of when Jesus returns, he will
[02:48:39.577 --> 02:48:43.301]  You know, he will disavow that and say, you know, there's only one God, the Father in Heaven.
[02:48:43.661 --> 02:48:45.182]  You know, he says, why do you call me good?
[02:48:45.943 --> 02:49:00.857]  And when you see in the Old Testament, Moses and his brother Aaron washing their feet, washing their hands, and praying and bowing in prayer, you see these indigenous spiritual practices continued by the Orthodox Jews, by the Orthodox Christians, and by the Muslims.
[02:49:01.037 --> 02:49:04.621]  So, at the end of the day, I think what they're really trying to do is continue this
[02:49:05.041 --> 02:49:06.661]  These mind games and this brainwashing.
[02:49:06.741 --> 02:49:07.082]  I hear you.
[02:49:07.102 --> 02:49:08.102]  I appreciate your call.
[02:49:08.542 --> 02:49:15.804]  I've always said this, whether the Bible's right or God's real or whatever, the elite is using as a template of control and they act just like the devil would.
[02:49:15.864 --> 02:49:17.004]  So it's real regardless.
[02:49:17.304 --> 02:49:18.224]  So end of debate.
[02:49:18.424 --> 02:49:18.784]  I hear you.
[02:49:19.084 --> 02:49:19.845]  Bruce in New York.
[02:49:19.865 --> 02:49:21.065]  You're on the air with John McAfee.
[02:49:21.085 --> 02:49:21.465]  Go ahead.
[02:49:22.865 --> 02:49:24.926]  Hey, Alex and John.
[02:49:25.366 --> 02:49:26.706]  Pleasure to be on the air.
[02:49:26.846 --> 02:49:29.087]  I need you to disavow the KKK first, Bruce.
[02:49:29.107 --> 02:49:30.087]  Can you disavow that for me?
[02:49:31.531 --> 02:49:32.131]  Absolutely.
[02:49:32.151 --> 02:49:32.471]  I did.
[02:49:32.491 --> 02:49:33.472]  I said absolutely not in America.
[02:49:33.492 --> 02:49:34.452]  Well, maybe you're working for CNN.
[02:49:54.870 --> 02:49:56.111]  Disavow it.
[02:49:56.812 --> 02:49:58.413]  I disavow every practice.
[02:49:58.933 --> 02:50:01.315]  And, you know, it's a shame.
[02:50:02.356 --> 02:50:06.960]  It is a shame that CNN has been riding this dead horse for three days.
[02:50:07.300 --> 02:50:08.141]  I'm so pissed.
[02:50:08.602 --> 02:50:09.042]  I hear you.
[02:50:09.102 --> 02:50:09.903]  It's pure propaganda.
[02:50:09.923 --> 02:50:11.164]  What's your view on what's happening, brother?
[02:50:12.345 --> 02:50:18.490]  Well, I just wanted to call and say thank you and thank your staff for everything they do.
[02:50:19.771 --> 02:50:21.052]  Well, it choked up here because
[02:50:24.425 --> 02:50:27.408]  I understand because you've been exposed for being a bad person.
[02:50:27.628 --> 02:50:31.131]  See, I have moral authority because I accused you of being one of the Klan, so I'm good.
[02:50:31.151 --> 02:50:34.494]  By the way, I have a show starting next week on MSNBC.
[02:50:35.735 --> 02:50:50.066]  I should say that I recently called to talk about Trump, but I want you and your viewers to know that I served in our military for almost eight years, and the CIA for 23 years after that.
[02:50:54.628 --> 02:50:57.409]  And, uh, you know, I had to veil over my eyes.
[02:50:59.110 --> 02:51:13.736]  But, uh, you know, after 9-11 and everything else happened, uh, my eyes opened and, uh, I can only say that, you know, there's, there's, uh, bad things happening in our country.
[02:51:15.257 --> 02:51:15.637]  I agree.
[02:51:15.677 --> 02:51:18.098]  Would you agree that we've pretty much been taken over?
[02:51:18.158 --> 02:51:19.659]  That this is an occupation?
[02:51:19.979 --> 02:51:21.299]  That's why they have us doing bad things.
[02:51:21.319 --> 02:51:22.720]  They want to demoralize all of us.
[02:51:23.953 --> 02:51:32.177]  Well, here's one of the worst things we've done here, Alex, and that is we treat our veterans like they're aliens.
[02:51:32.638 --> 02:51:38.381]  Now, we ask a young man and a young woman to go overseas and risk their life and say, look, you may not come back alive.
[02:51:38.741 --> 02:51:41.843]  And if you do come back, you may come back missing an arm or a leg or both.
[02:51:42.363 --> 02:51:46.205]  And when they do come back missing an arm or a leg, we say thank you and we discard them.
[02:51:46.638 --> 02:51:47.359]  It's a tragedy.
[02:51:47.640 --> 02:51:49.082]  We have a contract with these people.
[02:51:49.122 --> 02:51:54.049]  It may not be a written contract, but it's a known contract.
[02:51:54.149 --> 02:51:56.933]  If we ask you to risk your life for the country...
[02:51:57.486 --> 02:52:00.789]  But then, good God, Alex, we owe you something when you come back and you're maimed.
[02:52:00.889 --> 02:52:01.710]  We owe it to you.
[02:52:02.090 --> 02:52:03.312]  And we're not giving it to you.
[02:52:03.332 --> 02:52:08.136]  You said they're persecuting them because these wars aren't good, but these are at least people that are willing to sacrifice.
[02:52:08.457 --> 02:52:11.339]  The parasite class, the donor class, is scared of them.
[02:52:11.700 --> 02:52:13.061]  Sir, you say you were in the CIA.
[02:52:13.422 --> 02:52:15.464]  That's where they recruit out of the military, obviously.
[02:52:15.484 --> 02:52:16.565]  It's a huge organization.
[02:52:17.265 --> 02:52:27.708]  Uh, but specifically, you were probably, I don't know what you were involved in, analysts, HUMET, whatever it was, but back then we were really dealing with the Russians and others, and we didn't have all the electronic surveillance, so that's why the missions, I know, were a lot different.
[02:52:28.048 --> 02:52:31.569]  But the mission today is domestic, and a lot of really bad stuff's happening.
[02:52:32.309 --> 02:52:36.110]  What is your view, or what ended up waking you up, and where do you think this is all going?
[02:52:37.230 --> 02:52:45.613]  Well, when I, when I, uh, when I signed on with the agency, it was, uh, I served in the European theater, uh, for 20 years.
[02:52:47.641 --> 02:52:53.326]  Uh, traveled almost every month and, uh, you know, we're fighting the Soviet Union.
[02:52:54.807 --> 02:53:00.832]  So in my viewpoint, you know, that was the greatest thing we could do as a country.
[02:53:01.653 --> 02:53:11.041]  But, uh, you know, there are a lot of, you know, there, there's a lot happening behind the curtain that people don't realize.
[02:53:12.042 --> 02:53:15.545]  And, uh, you know, after.
[02:53:16.670 --> 02:53:40.267]  You know, after 9-11, when 9-11 happened, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but, you know, a lot of things happened with 9-11 with the two buildings coming down, and then Building 7 dropping like, you know, it was, uh, you know, a, uh, a demo, uh, uh, project, uh, you know, you have to realize...
[02:53:41.792 --> 02:53:45.694]  I bet you weren't an analyst or a paper pusher or a bureaucrat in the CIA.
[02:53:45.714 --> 02:53:46.775]  Were you a guy on the ground?
[02:53:48.136 --> 02:53:53.739]  Yeah, I was a guy on the ground, but not ground force.
[02:53:53.859 --> 02:53:57.121]  You know, I wasn't toting guns or anything.
[02:53:58.202 --> 02:54:00.143]  But, you know, I served my country.
[02:54:00.383 --> 02:54:01.263]  No, no, I understand.
[02:54:01.504 --> 02:54:03.185]  You just sound like a regular guy, but also smart.
[02:54:03.845 --> 02:54:05.486]  And it's pretty amazing.
[02:54:05.506 --> 02:54:08.428]  Folks don't know what went on during the Cold War with people on the ground in Europe.
[02:54:09.528 --> 02:54:13.389]  Pretty wild stuff from what I've read in books and also heard from some people that were there.
[02:54:14.349 --> 02:54:16.350]  Just daily killings fighting the Soviets.
[02:54:16.930 --> 02:54:19.430]  Just amazing stuff and a lot of that's heated back up in Ukraine today.
[02:54:19.770 --> 02:54:20.451]  God bless you, sir.
[02:54:20.491 --> 02:54:21.451]  I appreciate your call.
[02:54:22.171 --> 02:54:25.512]  John McAfee, I want to hit a call or two here in the next segment.
[02:54:26.432 --> 02:54:28.693]  I really appreciate you coming on with us.
[02:54:29.273 --> 02:54:34.094]  Other tidbits of knowledge as you run for president, people getting behind you, obviously the libertarian
[02:54:35.594 --> 02:54:35.855]  Vote.
[02:54:36.395 --> 02:54:38.237]  I don't really see you hurting Trump or Hillary.
[02:54:38.277 --> 02:54:43.341]  I see you kind of equally drawing from liberals and conservatives and libertarians and certainly educating people.
[02:54:43.581 --> 02:54:50.727]  So I support your run for the presidency because I hope you get it, you know, to use as a bully pulpit to educate because resistance is victory.
[02:54:50.767 --> 02:54:52.468]  Even if you don't win, it's a win.
[02:54:52.488 --> 02:54:54.510]  So I would challenge folks to get involved and support you.
[02:54:54.770 --> 02:54:56.511]  I know Jakari Jackson is a supporter of you.
[02:54:56.531 --> 02:54:58.132]  That's who he says he's voting for President for.
[02:54:58.473 --> 02:54:59.714]  So he hopes you get the nomination.
[02:55:00.998 --> 02:55:03.819]  Well, you know, I will win if we get the American support.
[02:55:03.919 --> 02:55:05.399]  And we need support, Alex.
[02:55:05.419 --> 02:55:06.340]  We're a very small party.
[02:55:07.700 --> 02:55:13.602]  And please go to McAfee2016.com if you can volunteer your time, or even donate 50 cents.
[02:55:13.722 --> 02:55:14.922]  It would help us tremendously.
[02:55:15.182 --> 02:55:23.144]  We are up against the two major machines that basically chew up people, the soul and the body of mankind, and make them cogs in a wheel.
[02:55:23.665 --> 02:55:25.065]  I hate to say that, but it is the truth.
[02:55:25.405 --> 02:55:26.285]  And it has to change.
[02:55:26.325 --> 02:55:28.406]  And this is the only year I think we have where this will happen.
[02:55:28.906 --> 02:55:29.587]  We can change.
[02:55:29.887 --> 02:55:33.570]  We can actually become, make a president from the Libertarian Party this year.
[02:55:33.610 --> 02:55:34.891]  I believe I will be the nominee.
[02:55:35.292 --> 02:55:36.133]  And you have to believe me, I'm 70.
[02:55:36.553 --> 02:55:37.794]  I do not do things lightly.
[02:55:37.834 --> 02:55:41.838]  I'm not doing this to make a statement, or to try to raise the awareness for a topic.
[02:55:41.878 --> 02:55:42.898]  No, I'm doing this to win.
[02:55:43.299 --> 02:55:45.701]  I can't afford to waste just a year doing nothing.
[02:55:45.881 --> 02:55:48.403]  I will win this presidential election, I promise you.
[02:55:48.663 --> 02:55:49.304]  But we need your help.
[02:55:49.544 --> 02:55:52.587]  Well, John McAfee, I know you'll win the info war, getting the word out regardless.
[02:55:52.607 --> 02:55:53.247]  So God bless you.
[02:55:53.267 --> 02:55:54.589]  I look forward to speaking to you again very, very soon.
[02:55:55.438 --> 02:55:56.038]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:56:15.023 --> 02:56:17.284]  Trump is unstoppable unless they steal the election from him.
[02:56:17.304 --> 02:56:22.647]  That is a no-brainer, or unless he goes out and starts saying really bad things, which are meant to destroy himself.
[02:56:22.687 --> 02:56:30.330]  And if he does that, it's the biggest PSYOP I've ever witnessed, and I've been suckered, and that hadn't really ever happened on something big like this where I've studied it in depth.
[02:56:30.390 --> 02:56:34.512]  I get, you know, I get stuff wrong all the time when I go too quick or don't think about something and I make mistakes.
[02:56:35.573 --> 02:56:37.014]  My gut tells me this is historic.
[02:56:37.054 --> 02:56:39.175]  I agree with people
[02:56:40.345 --> 02:56:47.167]  Like the governor, former governor of Arkansas, how can he come out saying this is an overthrow of this corrupt government, that this is a movement?
[02:56:47.187 --> 02:56:48.167]  Well, that's what we've been saying.
[02:56:48.187 --> 02:56:49.788]  But it's not an overthrow of the U.S.
[02:56:49.828 --> 02:56:59.091]  government, it's an overthrow of the donor class, the foreign interest, the special interests that say they're setting up a world government and conquering nation states, and have already done it in most places.
[02:57:00.428 --> 02:57:05.374]  Briefly, you don't know the power you have of spreading the word about Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:57:06.234 --> 02:57:12.781]  Sending out links to the free podcast, videos, books, the links to different news pieces we've done, articles.
[02:57:13.202 --> 02:57:14.363]  You're doing it more and more.
[02:57:14.423 --> 02:57:15.504]  It's having a giant effect.
[02:57:15.604 --> 02:57:16.505]  Let's redouble it.
[02:57:16.786 --> 02:57:17.907]  We're really having a big effect.
[02:57:17.947 --> 02:57:18.708]  Everybody can see that.
[02:57:18.748 --> 02:57:19.669]  We're doing this all together.
[02:57:21.107 --> 02:57:27.911]  Ben Carson is telling supporters he sees no path forward for presidential campaign and is signaling, obviously, that he's ready to throw his support for somebody.
[02:57:28.771 --> 02:57:35.194]  So look for that and I hope he goes behind Trump because that'll put us over the top and may even be able to override the fraud.
[02:57:36.475 --> 02:57:37.656]  Finally, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:57:38.666 --> 02:57:44.589]  There's only one way right now to get items that have sold out at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:57:45.089 --> 02:57:47.110]  It's both the same shopping cart, two different URLs.
[02:57:47.570 --> 02:57:53.993]  Oxy Powder, Secret 12, Lung Cleanse, Oil of Oregano, Occupower, Ancient Defense, they will all sell out in the next few days.
[02:57:54.533 --> 02:58:01.556]  So either get them today or sign up for AutoShip and get them when you want, how you want it, and get 10% off additional.
[02:58:02.136 --> 02:58:05.498]  We also have 50% off on Colloidal Silver's Silver Bullet.
[02:58:05.898 --> 02:58:07.619]  It already has an incredibly low price, normally of $19.95.
[02:58:07.699 --> 02:58:07.899]  It's $9.95.
[02:58:07.999 --> 02:58:15.783]  This is the exact same stuff that we get private-labeled from the biggest high-quality manufacturer in the country that sells it for $24.95.
[02:58:16.383 --> 02:58:17.904]  We sell it for $19.95 usually.

[02:59:54.469 --> 02:59:58.973]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:04.618 --> 03:00:10.623]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:11.244 --> 03:00:14.227]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:20.216 --> 03:00:23.537]  The full report's up at InfoWars.com, but here's part of it.
[03:00:23.897 --> 03:00:26.038]  Richard Reeves talks to Bernie Sanders supporters.
[03:00:26.598 --> 03:00:28.378]  Who are they going to support if he loses?
[03:00:28.859 --> 03:00:30.619]  Their answers are very important.
[03:00:34.440 --> 03:00:36.261]  Oh, you already voted?
[03:00:36.281 --> 03:00:38.021]  Come here, come here.
[03:00:38.281 --> 03:00:38.882]  What's your name, sir?
[03:00:39.322 --> 03:00:40.062]  Wyatt Tackle.
[03:00:40.582 --> 03:00:42.423]  Wyatt, tell us who you voted for.
[03:00:44.827 --> 03:00:46.588]  I voted for Bernie Sanders.
[03:00:47.129 --> 03:00:47.970]  Bernie Sanders.
[03:00:47.990 --> 03:00:51.773]  So a lot of your comrades here on campus voted for Bernie Sanders, evidently, right?
[03:00:52.053 --> 03:00:53.814]  That is the impression I get, yes.
[03:00:54.495 --> 03:00:57.817]  So when you talk to your comrades, what do they think about Donald J. Trump?
[03:00:58.618 --> 03:00:59.759]  That he's their second choice.
[03:01:00.519 --> 03:01:00.840]  Really?
[03:01:00.940 --> 03:01:01.500]  Second choice?
[03:01:01.520 --> 03:01:02.221]  Yeah.
[03:01:02.241 --> 03:01:03.422]  No, this is a new thing here now.
[03:01:04.429 --> 03:01:08.851]  Explain to us why that Donald J. Trump would be the second choice for Bernie Sanders supporters.
[03:01:09.391 --> 03:01:19.035]  Because they value that he's not an establishment candidate, and that he doesn't take big money from other people, and his name isn't Hillary Clinton.
[03:01:20.214 --> 03:01:20.634]  Wow.
[03:01:20.674 --> 03:01:27.520]  So folks, there's something I've been talking about for a while is I think the number two guy for a lot of Bernie Sanders folks is Donald J. Trump.
[03:01:27.860 --> 03:01:31.724]  And here we have confirmation from a young man here at UT.
[03:01:32.064 --> 03:01:34.326]  So you already voted or you're going to vote?
[03:01:34.546 --> 03:01:35.106]  I already voted.
[03:01:35.126 --> 03:01:35.747]  Okay.
[03:01:36.107 --> 03:01:40.151]  So besides Bernie Sanders and Trump, who did you look at?
[03:01:40.211 --> 03:01:41.352]  Who'd you consider?
[03:01:42.052 --> 03:01:45.195]  Um, that was really pretty much it.
[03:01:46.044 --> 03:01:48.325]  So that makes it pretty much anti-establishment.
[03:01:48.765 --> 03:01:50.126]  Absolutely, that's very important to me.
[03:01:50.506 --> 03:01:56.589]  Reports up at InfoWars.com, and we should do more of these, but the polls are showing a lot of them are going to go Trump.
[03:01:57.289 --> 03:02:00.451]  And then they ask, well would you go for Cruz or Rubio, and they say no.
[03:02:01.251 --> 03:02:02.952]  And that's what the numbers are showing.
[03:02:03.012 --> 03:02:07.694]  It's an anti-establishment revolt against the donor class, which is the globalists.
[03:02:08.499 --> 03:02:10.740]  And of course they're freaked out at Trump saying he'll bypass them.
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:19.884]  He's already bypassed them, spending a fraction in the campaign of what others have, and not spending money on radio and TV ads and newspaper ads.
[03:02:19.944 --> 03:02:27.268]  So the whole system, the whole stinking system that has hijacked the country and maneuvered us to this point is so upset.
[03:02:28.973 --> 03:02:32.174]  The big bad news is, though, looks like they're getting ready.
[03:02:32.214 --> 03:02:33.895]  He's got a big announcement he's making tomorrow.
[03:02:34.155 --> 03:02:38.477]  It'll probably be that he's looking to run for president to try to make it look like, you know, people begging to do it.
[03:02:38.957 --> 03:02:39.577]  Mitt Romney.
[03:02:40.318 --> 03:02:45.940]  And Carson says he's just about to get out, so we'll follow all of that very, very closely.
[03:02:45.960 --> 03:02:47.180]  I want to jam in one more call.
[03:02:47.200 --> 03:02:47.961]  The folks want to hold it.
[03:02:47.981 --> 03:02:48.981]  We'll probably talk tonight.
[03:02:49.401 --> 03:02:50.722]  Craig in California.
[03:02:51.182 --> 03:02:52.122]  Thanks for holding.
[03:02:52.182 --> 03:02:52.983]  Craig, you're on the air.
[03:02:53.023 --> 03:02:53.363]  Go ahead.
[03:02:54.659 --> 03:02:56.219]  Hey Alex, pleasure to get to talk to you.
[03:02:56.259 --> 03:02:57.620]  Thanks so much for having me on the air.
[03:02:57.640 --> 03:02:58.700]  Please don't thank me, thank you.
[03:03:00.061 --> 03:03:04.142]  Okay, well I want to thank you for the discount on the stuff because I did take advantage of the sale this weekend.
[03:03:04.322 --> 03:03:05.462]  Thank you.
[03:03:05.482 --> 03:03:09.183]  And I was a skeptical supporter of the products just to support the show.
[03:03:09.203 --> 03:03:13.224]  And I got the Male Vitality and it really does make the blood flow.
[03:03:13.964 --> 03:03:16.085]  And then I ordered three new products this time.
[03:03:16.893 --> 03:03:21.397]  By the way, I'm not somebody, I don't want to get graphic, but this is medical here, you know, I'm being honest.
[03:03:22.218 --> 03:03:25.961]  I mean, I don't have a problem, let's just say that, but I forgot what it was like to be 18.
[03:03:27.001 --> 03:03:32.326]  So I already had, you know, good stamina and vitality, but it's like, whoa, 40-something, I really forgot.
[03:03:32.886 --> 03:03:39.231]  Man, wow, I didn't realize that, and it's not even really designed for that.
[03:03:39.572 --> 03:03:40.533]  It's just the libido.
[03:03:40.853 --> 03:03:43.415]  How many days did it take you to notice something different in the morning?
[03:03:44.625 --> 03:03:49.114]  Like six days and I'm 50 years old and I feel like a teenager in the morning.
[03:03:49.474 --> 03:03:55.847]  But let's talk about Trump because I feel like he's already my president and we're living in super exciting times.
[03:03:56.420 --> 03:04:05.086]  And I'm watching the cheating going on because I'm not someone who watches a lot of television, but I obviously am interested in the election, so I'm paying attention.
[03:04:05.106 --> 03:04:12.372]  And I'm seeing a lot of NLP, neuro-linguistic programming going on to make Trump look bad and to make Rubio look good.
[03:04:12.572 --> 03:04:16.635]  Sure, well he doesn't do all the polished stuff like they do.
[03:04:16.655 --> 03:04:19.237]  And the way they talk to you like you're five and do all that, yeah.
[03:04:20.635 --> 03:04:22.936]  Well, neuro-linguistic programming is deeper than that.
[03:04:22.996 --> 03:04:26.118]  It's actually trying to program people with words and anchoring.
[03:04:26.138 --> 03:04:30.481]  You know, you can Google it and you can actually change people's... No, I know.
[03:04:30.621 --> 03:04:32.822]  All these tricksters study all these things.
[03:04:32.902 --> 03:04:35.223]  I mean, I know, and Delphi techniques and all that.
[03:04:35.544 --> 03:04:39.366]  But it just can't stand up against old-fashioned primal instincts and common sense.
[03:04:39.386 --> 03:04:40.246]  But God bless you, Craig.
[03:04:40.266 --> 03:04:40.967]  Sorry I'm out of time.
[03:04:41.347 --> 03:04:45.269]  David Knight is coming up and he has got a lot of stuff he's going to be covering.
[03:04:45.309 --> 03:04:47.771]  So, in three minutes when we come back, out of the gates.
[03:04:48.511 --> 03:04:55.618]  We've got the relief stallion here on the Pony Express coming out of the gates to finish up the transmission.
[03:04:55.658 --> 03:04:56.219]  David Knight.
[03:04:56.599 --> 03:04:59.862]  And then Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m., plus the Natalie News tonight at 7.
[03:05:01.977 --> 03:05:07.360]  We are quickly approaching the five-year anniversary of Osama Bin Laden's supposed death at the hands of Navy SEALs.
[03:05:07.520 --> 03:05:14.383]  And to commemorate this, the Obama administration released 113 documents that were seized in the May 2nd, 2011 raid.
[03:05:14.663 --> 03:05:21.667]  And if you read the myriad of articles at Daily Mail, he supposedly writes he wants to leave his vast multi-million dollar fortune to the global jihad.
[03:05:21.867 --> 03:05:24.388]  He also worried that his wife had been implanted with a tracking chip.
[03:05:24.608 --> 03:05:26.949]  But he doesn't sign any of the documents in his name.
[03:05:27.149 --> 03:05:32.771]  He signs one, Saeed bin Usama, another, Usama bin Muhammad, and another, Abu Abdallah.
[03:05:32.971 --> 03:05:37.113]  But I ask, why didn't he use his CIA codename of Tim Osman in any of these letters?
[03:05:37.473 --> 03:05:41.675]  Remember, it was C. Bell Edmonds, the FBI translator, who broke a gag order and said that the U.S.
[03:05:41.695 --> 03:05:47.397]  had been working with Osama bin Laden right up until 9-11, and they were outsourcing him to conduct terror operations all over the world.
[03:05:47.657 --> 03:05:48.518]  There's one final note.
[03:05:48.558 --> 03:05:51.939]  He was calling on Americans to help President Obama fight climate change.
[03:05:52.139 --> 03:05:57.825]  So using liberal logic, if you don't disavow climate change, then you refer Osama bin Laden.
[03:05:58.165 --> 03:06:00.988]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:06:01.669 --> 03:06:02.569]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[03:06:02.610 --> 03:06:03.030]  Good, brother.
[03:06:03.170 --> 03:06:04.892]  Just recently started using your products.
[03:06:05.112 --> 03:06:06.714]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:06:06.834 --> 03:06:10.898]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:06:11.138 --> 03:06:13.439]  Thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[03:06:13.479 --> 03:06:15.759]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[03:06:15.899 --> 03:06:23.801]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[03:06:23.961 --> 03:06:27.222]  We do the Super Male and the Super Female Vitality.
[03:06:27.322 --> 03:06:28.822]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[03:06:28.842 --> 03:06:31.743]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[03:06:31.903 --> 03:06:33.263]  Saving a ton of money there.
[03:06:33.543 --> 03:06:37.864]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet,
[03:06:38.084 --> 03:06:41.187]  And then concentrated or maximum potency.
[03:06:41.207 --> 03:06:51.537]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience where stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[03:06:51.597 --> 03:06:53.339]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[03:06:53.399 --> 03:07:00.346]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from Infowarslife.
[03:07:02.802 --> 03:07:06.205]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:07:06.585 --> 03:07:13.691]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:07:14.312 --> 03:07:22.718]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:07:22.919 --> 03:07:26.962]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:07:27.322 --> 03:07:36.786]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:07:37.166 --> 03:07:40.267]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:07:40.587 --> 03:07:51.632]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:07:51.732 --> 03:07:54.377]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[03:07:54.617 --> 03:07:57.563]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[03:07:57.723 --> 03:08:00.588]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[03:08:13.621 --> 03:08:15.785]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:08:16.305 --> 03:08:21.433]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:08:24.708 --> 03:08:26.169]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:26.230 --> 03:08:27.931]  I'm David Knight, your host for this hour.
[03:08:27.991 --> 03:08:29.252]  We've got a lot to talk about.
[03:08:29.272 --> 03:08:42.724]  We're going to talk about CNN and the mainstream media continuing to beat the dead horse of the KKK accusations, but we're also going to talk about the stalking horse, who I think is Marco Rubio, a stalking horse for Mitt Romney.
[03:08:42.744 --> 03:08:44.166]  We're going to talk about that aspect of it.
[03:08:44.186 --> 03:08:50.672]  We're also going to talk about a very interesting story that Rob Jacobson brought to my attention about a Utah sheriff
[03:08:51.312 --> 03:08:59.703]  Who says that he will deputize every citizen in his county if necessary to stop the abuses of the Forest Service.
[03:08:59.723 --> 03:09:01.465]  We're going to talk about what's going on.
[03:09:01.905 --> 03:09:06.972]  We have to remember that this pushback, the Sagebrush Rebellion,
[03:09:07.752 --> 03:09:10.093]  Uh, is something that is going on across America.
[03:09:10.133 --> 03:09:14.993]  It's going on from Texas to Oregon to Utah to Nevada.
[03:09:15.214 --> 03:09:15.994]  Many different places.
[03:09:16.074 --> 03:09:19.174]  And these are people, government, you don't want to mess with.
[03:09:19.434 --> 03:09:19.734]  Okay?
[03:09:19.774 --> 03:09:23.015]  These are real men who will stand up and fight for their living.
[03:09:23.035 --> 03:09:23.715]  They work hard.
[03:09:24.155 --> 03:09:28.556]  They have been there on the land for a long time and they don't take this kind of stuff from tyrants.
[03:09:28.696 --> 03:09:28.976]  Okay?
[03:09:29.416 --> 03:09:30.957]  This is where this is going to break down.
[03:09:30.977 --> 03:09:32.417]  So we're going to talk to you about that first.
[03:09:33.297 --> 03:09:43.700]  But I want to talk about the local situation because we had a caller earlier today that was talking to Alex, and Alex was talking about how we need to get delegates, we need to fight this at the local level, and we do.
[03:09:43.840 --> 03:09:46.640]  We need to take over control of the local parties.
[03:09:47.180 --> 03:09:49.701]  We need to make sure that we have control of the delegates.
[03:09:49.721 --> 03:09:54.042]  We need to wrest this thing away from the establishment party.
[03:09:54.302 --> 03:09:57.583]  I've played that video over and over again of Reince Priebus saying,
[03:09:58.143 --> 03:09:59.724]  This isn't an election, essentially.
[03:09:59.784 --> 03:10:00.945]  I'm paraphrasing him.
[03:10:00.985 --> 03:10:08.210]  The CNN correspondent, Alison Camerota, was absolutely amazed at the way he was responding to things.
[03:10:08.230 --> 03:10:10.031]  He said, you have to understand what the process is here.
[03:10:10.592 --> 03:10:17.036]  These guys are auditioning to join us, and motioning with his hands like they're going to join us.
[03:10:17.076 --> 03:10:20.279]  And she said, well, yeah, kind of, but we have an election going on here, voters.
[03:10:20.299 --> 03:10:21.379]  And he goes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:10:21.640 --> 03:10:22.440]  You're not hearing me.
[03:10:22.900 --> 03:10:26.323]  They are auditioning to join us, OK?
[03:10:26.343 --> 03:10:27.624]  It's their private country club.
[03:10:28.444 --> 03:10:30.185]  Uh, you aren't a member, okay?
[03:10:30.205 --> 03:10:32.606]  Just going back to the George Carlin thing.
[03:10:32.846 --> 03:10:34.507]  You know, it's a club and you ain't in it, folks.
[03:10:34.867 --> 03:10:35.888]  That's their attitude.
[03:10:36.348 --> 03:10:38.009]  We can take this thing from them.
[03:10:38.069 --> 03:10:42.551]  There's more of us than there are of them, and we can push them out of the way if we know the right things to do.
[03:10:42.591 --> 03:10:43.692]  Now, here's one of the right things to do.
[03:10:44.605 --> 03:10:56.591]  Here's an article from the Texas Tribune, came out today, talking about what's going on here in Travis County, the county where the Texas Capitol is involved, a fight for control of the GOP.
[03:10:56.932 --> 03:11:06.577]  A newly elected chair of the Republican Party here in Travis County, they say he was tweeting on election night about former Governor Rick Perry's sexual orientation.
[03:11:07.117 --> 03:11:09.658]  Also insisting that members of the Bush family should be in jail.
[03:11:09.718 --> 03:11:12.979]  This is the guy who is now the newly elected chair of the GOP.
[03:11:13.419 --> 03:11:21.122]  They say he also found time to call Hillary Clinton an angry bull dyke and accuse his county vice chair of betraying the values of the Republican Party.
[03:11:21.882 --> 03:11:23.663]  But he said the people have spoken.
[03:11:23.703 --> 03:11:24.784]  His name is Robert Morris.
[03:11:24.824 --> 03:11:26.724]  He won the helm of the Travis County GOP.
[03:11:26.744 --> 03:11:27.605]  He got 54% of the vote.
[03:11:28.925 --> 03:11:33.388]  He said, my friends and neighbors and political supporters wanted Robert Morrow.
[03:11:33.828 --> 03:11:41.172]  Now, his election as Republican chair of the fifth largest county in Texas, they say, left several members of the Travis County GOP apoplectic.
[03:11:41.232 --> 03:11:46.776]  Particularly, Matt McCowack, I guess is how you pronounce his name.
[03:11:47.456 --> 03:11:53.200]  But this is a guy who is the vice chair, and he is something of an establishment man.
[03:11:53.460 --> 03:11:54.340]  Listen to what he said.
[03:11:54.801 --> 03:11:58.463]  He said, we will explore every single option that exists.
[03:11:58.703 --> 03:12:12.267]  Whether it be persuading him to resign, trying to force him to resign, constraining his power, removing his ability to spend money, resisting any attempt for him to access data or our social media account.
[03:12:12.627 --> 03:12:15.588]  He said, I'm treating this as a coup, as a hostile takeover.
[03:12:15.928 --> 03:12:17.068]  Well, yeah, I understand that it is.
[03:12:17.588 --> 03:12:20.089]  And when you do that, it's going to get more hostile.
[03:12:20.828 --> 03:12:21.328]  You want to fight?
[03:12:21.428 --> 03:12:22.109]  You got one.
[03:12:22.569 --> 03:12:22.849]  Okay?
[03:12:22.909 --> 03:12:24.029]  Right here in Travis County.
[03:12:24.369 --> 03:12:28.471]  And so the response of Robert Morris, he said he told the Tribune, tell them they can go F themselves.
[03:12:28.571 --> 03:12:28.731]  Okay?
[03:12:28.751 --> 03:12:29.671]  He's not backing down.
[03:12:30.252 --> 03:12:43.557]  He says, even as McAleay attempts to unseat Morrow, Morrow has called McAleay's own conservative credentials into question, especially because of recent tweets from him that included the hashtag, hashtag never Trump.
[03:12:44.117 --> 03:12:44.437]  Okay?
[03:12:44.637 --> 03:12:45.638]  He says, I don't even think
[03:12:46.440 --> 03:12:53.766]  Macaulayac, and I don't know if I'm pronouncing his name properly, is going to support the Republican nominee, who is probably going to be Trump, said Morrow.
[03:12:54.186 --> 03:12:57.889]  What kind of traitor to the party is Macaulayac?
[03:12:58.389 --> 03:13:04.454]  The incredible amount of damage someone like him does to the party, and he's a... Well, I won't repeat it.
[03:13:05.394 --> 03:13:11.740]  He says, the Republican Party, I would hope, is about limited government with a libertarian perspective, but it's a big tent.
[03:13:12.141 --> 03:13:15.424]  There are many factions in it, and that's okay with me, said Morrow.
[03:13:15.464 --> 03:13:16.084]  Well, you know what?
[03:13:16.725 --> 03:13:20.829]  Morrow, the GOP sees itself as a closed country club.
[03:13:21.189 --> 03:13:24.051]  We're all auditioning to join them.
[03:13:24.111 --> 03:13:26.253]  And you know, you just didn't use the right kind of language.
[03:13:26.573 --> 03:13:27.654]  You didn't kiss the ring.
[03:13:28.775 --> 03:13:33.438]  You don't understand that this is not a libertarian perspective, but a globalist perspective.
[03:13:33.458 --> 03:13:36.881]  But I think Mark Morrow does understand that.
[03:13:37.546 --> 03:13:38.926]  And I think there is going to be a fight.
[03:13:38.986 --> 03:13:41.047]  And there needs to be a fight at the local level.
[03:13:41.127 --> 03:13:47.228]  We don't need to use a lot of foul language, but we don't need to bow down to these guys either, okay?
[03:13:47.288 --> 03:13:52.329]  This was a takeover and they may not like it, but it is not their private country club.
[03:13:53.089 --> 03:13:55.370]  We have to understand that's the way they've been running this two-party system.
[03:13:55.750 --> 03:14:01.031]  And we have to understand that I don't believe that a two-party system is something that we need to have.
[03:14:01.988 --> 03:14:07.269]  Pretty much every other country in the world, even Russia, you know, which went from a one-party system to a multi-party system.
[03:14:07.530 --> 03:14:08.570]  They have multiple parties.
[03:14:09.850 --> 03:14:11.911]  Can you make a decision when you go into the grocery store?
[03:14:12.231 --> 03:14:17.492]  Are you threatened when you see multiple choices for peanut butter or for cornflakes?
[03:14:17.712 --> 03:14:18.593]  No, you can handle it.
[03:14:18.693 --> 03:14:19.253]  You really can.
[03:14:20.086 --> 03:14:23.427]  And we can really handle multiple choices in the establishment.
[03:14:23.467 --> 03:14:23.947]  And you know what?
[03:14:24.027 --> 03:14:26.188]  It would really clean up these races as well.
[03:14:26.748 --> 03:14:34.250]  Because if you start attacking everybody, you know, like a Marco Rubio or something, then people start looking at you as the one with the problem.
[03:14:34.570 --> 03:14:36.191]  It doesn't really have an effect at that point.
[03:14:36.551 --> 03:14:42.254]  I think when you have multiple parties, it forces people to talk about issues more than personalities.
[03:14:42.674 --> 03:14:44.095]  And that's what we want to get to.
[03:14:44.635 --> 03:14:50.618]  And even if you're going to have two parties, the question is, do we really want it to be the Democrats and the Republicans?
[03:14:51.798 --> 03:14:57.262]  One of the things that we can do is take these guys over from the inside and change the Republican Party.
[03:14:57.302 --> 03:15:00.165]  We don't necessarily have to change the name or the branding or whatever.
[03:15:00.185 --> 03:15:01.766]  We just take the thing over.
[03:15:01.906 --> 03:15:04.728]  But we have to do it at the grassroots level.
[03:15:05.108 --> 03:15:06.890]  We have to do it from the ground up.
[03:15:07.450 --> 03:15:22.934]  Now, before I go to this important story about what's going on with the Sagebrush Rebellion, let's talk a little bit about last night's election and the fact that I talked about how Marco Rubio is increasingly becoming transparent as a stalking horse for the establishment, if not for Mitt Romney, for somebody else.
[03:15:23.075 --> 03:15:27.096]  Here's an interesting article that I thought was really funny last night from the Huffington Post.
[03:15:27.496 --> 03:15:27.896]  Headline.
[03:15:28.436 --> 03:15:32.559]  Marco Rubio loses 9 more states, falls to 1 in 13 on the election season.
[03:15:32.599 --> 03:15:37.141]  Actually, after this was written, it went to 1 in 14 because he didn't win in Alaska either.
[03:15:37.942 --> 03:15:46.447]  They said, Senator Marco Rubio lost primaries or caucuses in at least 9 states on Tuesday, moving his record in the race for Republican presidential nomination to 1 in 14.
[03:15:46.727 --> 03:15:52.851]  That's a worse record through the first 14 contests than the worst teams in the NFL last year.
[03:15:53.331 --> 03:15:58.917]  The Cleveland Browns and the Tennessee Titans at least managed to win three of their first 14 games.
[03:15:59.337 --> 03:16:07.566]  They say Rubio, whom the media proclaimed the real winner of three of the first four presidential primaries after he finished behind Donald Trump in all four.
[03:16:07.666 --> 03:16:13.372]  Yeah, he had a second place, a third place, two third places, I think, and a fifth place.
[03:16:14.321 --> 03:16:16.922]  Rubio lost even more on Tuesday, they say.
[03:16:17.402 --> 03:16:23.664]  Despite this impressive burst of losing, some people remained eager to spend the news for Rubio and against Trump.
[03:16:23.704 --> 03:16:26.104]  And they've got some tweets in here from various people.
[03:16:26.564 --> 03:16:31.106]  Some of them you may recognize, like Hugh Hewitt, one of the moderators.
[03:16:32.066 --> 03:16:33.386]  How moderate is that, okay?
[03:16:33.406 --> 03:16:35.887]  You know, a moderator means somebody that doesn't have sides.
[03:16:36.607 --> 03:16:45.830]  Do you see that in the debates, or do you see viciously partisan questions on the same issues over and over again with these debates?
[03:16:45.870 --> 03:16:46.510]  That's what I see.
[03:16:47.111 --> 03:16:47.911]  So here's Hugh Hewitt.
[03:16:48.651 --> 03:16:50.972]  He says, Arkansas was also too close to call.
[03:16:51.032 --> 03:16:52.092]  Wow, another surprise.
[03:16:52.472 --> 03:16:56.234]  Momentum tonight is flowing against Donald Trump, even as he racks up most of the wins.
[03:16:58.074 --> 03:16:58.695]  Desperate!
[03:16:59.115 --> 03:16:59.675]  Desperate!
[03:17:00.056 --> 03:17:03.318]  To try to spin this in a way that it is not going.
[03:17:03.438 --> 03:17:06.420]  Even as he racks up most of the wins, the momentum is flowing against him.
[03:17:07.014 --> 03:17:09.356]  Yeah, well, okay, he won Arkansas too, I believe.
[03:17:09.716 --> 03:17:15.000]  Anyway, Ben White, nobody is talking about it, but wouldn't Rubio winning Minnesota be kind of a big deal?
[03:17:15.460 --> 03:17:18.182]  At least to end the, he hasn't won anything line?
[03:17:18.422 --> 03:17:19.923]  Okay, there you go, he got one.
[03:17:19.963 --> 03:17:21.344]  He got one caucus.
[03:17:21.665 --> 03:17:28.449]  And another one from Tim Alberta, if Rubio doesn't win anywhere tonight, the story will be Kasich playing the spoiler in Virginia.
[03:17:28.810 --> 03:17:30.411]  He's in double digits in Fairfax.
[03:17:30.771 --> 03:17:31.972]  Luton and Prince William.
[03:17:32.032 --> 03:17:34.494]  Well, no, actually, Kasich wasn't the spoiler.
[03:17:35.254 --> 03:17:36.896]  He didn't spoil anything in Virginia.
[03:17:37.796 --> 03:17:39.818]  He didn't spoil anything in Vermont.
[03:17:39.878 --> 03:17:41.700]  He didn't even win there, okay?
[03:17:42.140 --> 03:17:45.923]  Now, actually the story is that the candidate of the Republican establishment is still losing.
[03:17:45.943 --> 03:17:46.924]  This is Huffington Post.
[03:17:46.964 --> 03:17:47.464]  Good for them.
[03:17:47.664 --> 03:17:48.885]  Good for them for pointing this out.
[03:17:49.246 --> 03:17:54.190]  Rubio showed Tuesday that he can beat Trump in one or two out of every 15 tries.
[03:17:54.850 --> 03:17:55.371]  There you go.
[03:17:55.471 --> 03:17:56.071]  That's our guy.
[03:17:56.372 --> 03:17:58.613]  That's the establishment champion right there.
[03:17:58.954 --> 03:17:59.995]  Mr. Bronze Medal.
[03:18:00.822 --> 03:18:06.743]  And they go on and say, in January, Rubio's team said he'd finished 3rd in Iowa, 2nd in New Hampshire, and 1st in South Carolina.
[03:18:06.763 --> 03:18:08.324]  They called it the 3-2-1 strategy.
[03:18:08.884 --> 03:18:15.525]  Well, Rubio actually finished 5th in New Hampshire, 2nd in South Carolina, where he didn't get a single delegate.
[03:18:15.605 --> 03:18:17.886]  Where every one of the delegates went to Donald Trump.
[03:18:18.366 --> 03:18:23.847]  And so they say, after Tuesday night, maybe we should rename the 3-2-1 strategy something like 3-5-2-2-3-2-3-2-3-3-3-1-3-2-3 strategy.
[03:18:23.867 --> 03:18:23.987]  Yeah.
[03:18:30.248 --> 03:18:31.429]  Mr. Bronze Medal.
[03:18:31.769 --> 03:18:39.834]  And they say, sadly, he's not even the Tennessee Titans, so he can't even count on a first pick in next year's draft.
[03:18:40.374 --> 03:18:40.654]  Okay?
[03:18:40.975 --> 03:18:42.195]  But it doesn't stop Rubio.
[03:18:42.716 --> 03:18:45.177]  Here's the headlines from CNN.
[03:18:45.598 --> 03:18:49.140]  Rubio rejoices, we fought Trump to a draw.
[03:18:49.300 --> 03:18:52.762]  This is what he actually said on CNN, talking to Jay Tapper.
[03:18:53.522 --> 03:18:57.225]  He says, his numbers, Trump's numbers are coming down, our numbers are going up.
[03:18:57.845 --> 03:18:58.125]  Really?
[03:18:58.425 --> 03:18:58.665]  Really?
[03:18:59.486 --> 03:19:00.666]  By what measure, Marco?
[03:19:01.087 --> 03:19:07.029]  I mean, you're absolutely in fantasy land by percentages, by the number of people who voted, by delegates won.
[03:19:07.490 --> 03:19:08.110]  You're losing.
[03:19:08.530 --> 03:19:08.970]  Big time.
[03:19:09.410 --> 03:19:12.732]  Your numbers are going down relative to his.
[03:19:12.752 --> 03:19:13.292]  That's important.
[03:19:13.312 --> 03:19:14.513]  Yeah, you got a couple of delegates.
[03:19:14.593 --> 03:19:15.153]  Okay, great.
[03:19:15.593 --> 03:19:18.895]  But that doesn't mean your numbers are going up and they certainly aren't going up at a faster rate.
[03:19:18.915 --> 03:19:27.239]  And so Tom Brokaw actually trolls him and says, oh, Marco Rubio looked like a guy who was running for student council president who didn't have a date to the prom.
[03:19:28.430 --> 03:19:28.770]  Yeah.
[03:19:28.891 --> 03:19:29.491]  Well, you know what?
[03:19:29.551 --> 03:19:30.152]  Here's the deal.
[03:19:31.293 --> 03:19:33.235]  Rubio doesn't have a chance.
[03:19:34.036 --> 03:19:34.777]  Is he crazy?
[03:19:34.977 --> 03:19:35.958]  Is he delusional?
[03:19:36.278 --> 03:19:42.365]  Or, when he says that you don't win by winning states, is that crazy?
[03:19:42.465 --> 03:19:44.808]  Or is it really a revelation of the method?
[03:19:45.628 --> 03:19:48.612]  Is he really just being set up as a stalking horse?
[03:19:48.652 --> 03:19:49.513]  Stay with us when we come back.
[03:19:49.533 --> 03:19:50.574]  We're going to talk about that angle.
[03:20:02.426 --> 03:20:13.016]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?

[03:22:31.417 --> 03:22:34.158]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[03:22:34.478 --> 03:22:37.079]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[03:22:37.119 --> 03:22:37.539]  Croix River.
[03:22:37.860 --> 03:22:38.500]  I loved my dad.
[03:22:38.900 --> 03:22:39.860]  But boy was he stubborn.
[03:22:40.081 --> 03:22:42.802]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[03:22:43.042 --> 03:22:43.562]  His excuse?
[03:22:43.922 --> 03:22:44.983]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[03:22:45.263 --> 03:22:46.543]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[03:22:46.863 --> 03:22:52.365]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[03:24:13.674 --> 03:24:16.857]  I'm David Knight, your host on this day after Super Tuesday.
[03:24:17.357 --> 03:24:20.580]  I want to take a couple of calls that have been hanging on here.
[03:24:21.321 --> 03:24:24.664]  Wild, WLD in Wisconsin, and Steven in Florida.
[03:24:24.684 --> 03:24:26.105]  Hang on, I'm going to get to you in just a moment.
[03:24:26.165 --> 03:24:26.705]  Before I do...
[03:24:27.506 --> 03:24:31.308]  I want to let everybody know that we have a new sale, a flash sale.
[03:24:32.048 --> 03:24:35.330]  This is going to be typically flash sales are just one day.
[03:24:35.350 --> 03:24:36.430]  I don't see that on the sheet here.
[03:24:36.690 --> 03:24:41.973]  A flash sale though for Silver Bullet, 50% off at Infowarslife.com for a limited time.

[03:24:57.184 --> 03:25:07.372]  We've already sold out of many products on Infowarslife.com because of our leap year sale, and we're expected to sell out of Silver Bullet through this sale, so act quickly.
[03:25:07.432 --> 03:25:13.437]  This is an unprecedented 50% off Silver Bullet, our colloidal silver, 30 parts per million.
[03:25:14.420 --> 03:25:16.602]  And that's at Infowarslife.com.
[03:25:17.503 --> 03:25:20.085]  Let's go to Wylde in Wisconsin.
[03:25:20.125 --> 03:25:20.705]  Go ahead, Wylde.
[03:25:20.725 --> 03:25:23.468]  How are you doing, Mr. Knight?
[03:25:24.048 --> 03:25:28.732]  I have a bold conversation starter t-shirt idea.
[03:25:29.653 --> 03:25:36.338]  I'm sure you're familiar with the Bad Hour or French Malheur refuge situation that we just had.
[03:25:36.358 --> 03:25:36.879]  Oh yeah.
[03:25:37.800 --> 03:25:41.102]  Oh yeah, we're going to be talking about something related to that coming up in the next segment.
[03:25:41.142 --> 03:25:41.583]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:25:42.984 --> 03:25:54.348]  I'm not sure if I would be bold enough to wear it, but on the front I was thinking to have, his name was LaVoy Finnecom, his name was LaVoy Finnecom, his name was LaVoy Finnecom, like over and over.
[03:25:54.368 --> 03:25:54.948]  Yeah.
[03:25:54.968 --> 03:25:56.929]  And then like 11 kids on the back.
[03:25:57.349 --> 03:25:58.849]  Or, hands up, don't shoot.
[03:25:59.269 --> 03:26:00.450]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:26:01.243 --> 03:26:04.345]  Yeah, or maybe like the Spartacus thing, you know, I am LaVoy Finnicum.
[03:26:05.166 --> 03:26:07.948]  I really am angry about what happened there.
[03:26:07.968 --> 03:26:09.649]  It was totally unjustified in my opinion.
[03:26:09.729 --> 03:26:25.920]  We've talked about that, we've looked at the shooting, and in terms of the way it was handled, you've got one officer who comes out there, exposes himself potentially to a threat from that vehicle that's parked, if it's such a threat that they need to kill him, and then after he's dead,
[03:26:26.440 --> 03:26:26.840]  We're good to go.
[03:26:45.931 --> 03:26:47.251]  And what they're doing with the iPhone.
[03:26:47.331 --> 03:26:52.493]  I mean, this stuff is not only evil, but it's incredibly incompetent.
[03:26:52.553 --> 03:26:53.513]  It's absolutely amazing.
[03:26:53.593 --> 03:26:54.233]  I agree with you.
[03:26:54.693 --> 03:26:56.014]  Let's go quickly to another call.
[03:26:56.034 --> 03:26:57.214]  Let's take Stephen in Florida.
[03:26:57.234 --> 03:26:57.814]  Stephen, go ahead.
[03:26:59.715 --> 03:27:01.175]  Yeah, hey David.
[03:27:01.255 --> 03:27:05.896]  First of all, I wanted to say that I disavow Alex's calls for disavowal.
[03:27:07.197 --> 03:27:09.497]  And I think that should about cover it.
[03:27:09.837 --> 03:27:11.518]  Yeah, we're not going to beat that dead horse anymore.
[03:27:12.278 --> 03:27:12.618]  Go ahead.
[03:27:13.917 --> 03:27:26.227]  As far as this whole election situation, there's something I've still got nagging thought in the back of my mind, and that is that Larry Nichols has alluded to this in his interviews with Alex.
[03:27:27.348 --> 03:27:39.217]  I'm still not counting out Obama pulling the national emergency slash martial law trigger so he can declare himself king and dictator and stay in power.
[03:27:40.633 --> 03:28:06.476]  I'm not going to be surprised at all if we don't end up having an election, because the way everything is being set up and going, Mr. McAfee just alluded to a possibility, a very real possibility of an EMP attack, and with the way we're goading and provoking our enemies that have the capability to do that, I really see that coming for one thing, and then of course with the economy and everything else, and I'm not a pessimist,
[03:28:06.949 --> 03:28:24.575]  I'm a realist and I can't help but look at everything and think that, you know, there's a very real possibility, even with momentum Trump's got, that, you know, that may be the way they decide to stop him ultimately is to just not allow the election to take place whatsoever.
[03:28:24.655 --> 03:28:26.116]  People need to keep that in mind.
[03:28:26.994 --> 03:28:41.707]  Well, you know, I wouldn't be surprised at anything that happens, and if we have a massive event of some sort, whether it's real or a false flag, you can imagine that the government is just ready to unleash on everybody.
[03:28:41.727 --> 03:28:51.655]  When you look at the way they conducted themselves at the Oscars the other day, we had some footage that was sent to us by somebody on the scene, and we have that article.
[03:28:51.695 --> 03:28:52.756]  You can see that at Infowars.com.
[03:28:54.068 --> 03:28:57.570]  It was absolutely amazing what they were doing to people there for the Oscars.
[03:28:58.231 --> 03:28:59.691]  And it's every event now.
[03:29:00.012 --> 03:29:00.712]  They ramp it up.
[03:29:01.032 --> 03:29:02.493]  And it's more and more martial law.
[03:29:02.533 --> 03:29:04.835]  So you can imagine if there is some real event.
[03:29:04.875 --> 03:29:18.263]  And of course, again, this shooting by these individuals in San Bernardino, that's now being used as justification to come after everybody's iPhones, to demand a backdoor, to demand that Apple create software that doesn't exist.
[03:29:18.743 --> 03:29:19.344]  It never ends.
[03:29:19.644 --> 03:29:20.906]  This is what we're seeing constantly.
[03:29:20.946 --> 03:29:23.630]  So yeah, nothing about that would surprise me.
[03:29:23.670 --> 03:29:24.291]  Thank you, Steven.
[03:29:24.432 --> 03:29:26.455]  And of course, we've got some footage right there.
[03:29:26.475 --> 03:29:31.803]  When we come back, I'm going to continue with what I was talking about in terms of the stalking horse.
[03:29:32.904 --> 03:29:34.406]  Why is Rubio there?
[03:29:35.546 --> 03:29:39.809]  What is behind all the overtures about Mitt Romney?
[03:29:39.829 --> 03:29:50.717]  We're going to take a look at that, and then we're also going to take a look at this situation in Utah, where the sheriff threatens to deputize every single citizen to hold off the militarized federal government.
[03:29:50.737 --> 03:29:51.478]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:29:51.498 --> 03:29:54.240]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.260 --> 03:29:57.883]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.963 --> 03:30:17.548]  Two Roman Catholic bishops who led a central Pennsylvania diocese helped cover up the sexual abuse of hundreds of children by over 50 priests or religious leaders over a 40-year period, according to a grand jury report issued Tuesday, reports Fox News.
[03:30:17.768 --> 03:30:30.312]  The 147-page report on sexual abuse in the local diocese was based partly on evidence from a secret archive uncovered through a search warrant executed in August, said Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane.
[03:30:30.472 --> 03:30:31.293]  We're good to go.
[03:30:47.108 --> 03:30:51.411]  No criminal charges are being filed in the case, because some abusers have died.
[03:30:51.572 --> 03:30:57.616]  The statute of limitations has expired, and in some cases, the victims are too traumatized to testify, she said.
[03:30:57.776 --> 03:31:01.459]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[03:31:06.363 --> 03:31:10.989]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[03:31:11.129 --> 03:31:12.150]  Talk about the effects.
[03:31:12.470 --> 03:31:13.952]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[03:31:13.972 --> 03:31:15.594]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[03:31:15.915 --> 03:31:16.976]  I feel like I look better.
[03:31:17.036 --> 03:31:17.677]  I feel better.
[03:31:17.737 --> 03:31:18.818]  I feel sexier.
[03:31:19.138 --> 03:31:19.519]  I love it.

[03:32:11.355 --> 03:32:17.056]  I needed to get my digestive system working correctly again, so I stumbled on the X2.

[03:33:13.471 --> 03:33:15.692]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:16.012 --> 03:33:19.873]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:19.914 --> 03:33:21.774]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:21.914 --> 03:33:23.175]  I'm your host, David Knight.
[03:33:23.195 --> 03:33:28.137]  Through this hour, we're going to take some more calls, and I want to go back to this, uh, the story that we were talking about.
[03:33:28.377 --> 03:33:29.858]  Why is Rubio here?
[03:33:29.978 --> 03:33:34.940]  We pointed out the Huffington Post was laughing about his record, saying his record falls to
[03:33:35.860 --> 03:33:36.961]  One and fourteen.
[03:33:37.061 --> 03:33:40.323]  He's worse than the worst NFL team at this point.
[03:33:41.404 --> 03:33:42.245]  It's pretty amazing.
[03:33:42.425 --> 03:33:43.526]  It's pretty ridiculous.
[03:33:43.786 --> 03:33:48.770]  And you have to ask yourself, when he says you don't win by winning states, is he crazy?
[03:33:48.910 --> 03:33:49.710]  Is he delusional?
[03:33:49.910 --> 03:33:54.273]  Or is he really kind of, in an offhand way, telling us something?
[03:33:55.114 --> 03:33:57.295]  Is Marco Rubio a stalking horse?
[03:33:57.455 --> 03:34:00.677]  Now, these metaphors that we use like stalking horse, think about this.
[03:34:00.917 --> 03:34:07.901]  If you've ever seen the movie Jeremiah Johnson, there's one scene where the two of them are going out to hunt a grizzly, okay?
[03:34:07.921 --> 03:34:13.684]  The experienced hunter and the green guy at that point, Jeremiah Johnson, and they get behind a horse.
[03:34:14.424 --> 03:34:21.868]  And they start, they get close to where the bear is, and they're using this stalking horse technique.
[03:34:22.819 --> 03:34:28.024]  And they're on the other side of the horse, so when the bear looks over at them, it just sees the horse.
[03:34:28.825 --> 03:34:32.769]  And Jeremiah Johnson says to the guy who's showing him how to do this, he goes, wait a minute, he's gonna see our legs.
[03:34:33.290 --> 03:34:36.753]  He says, a bear don't know how many legs a horse has got.
[03:34:37.634 --> 03:34:41.998]  Okay, maybe you don't know how many candidates the establishment has got.
[03:34:42.759 --> 03:34:46.622]  And what candidates are they hiding behind Marco Rubio?
[03:34:47.082 --> 03:34:52.066]  Now, let's take a look at Mitt Romney, because this is something that we broke last week.
[03:34:52.086 --> 03:34:53.107]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[03:34:53.127 --> 03:34:56.289]  But let's go back to September 30th of last year.
[03:34:56.729 --> 03:34:57.690]  Washington Post story.
[03:34:58.110 --> 03:35:02.533]  Mitt Romney weighs in on 2016, says Trump, quote, will not be the nominee.
[03:35:03.414 --> 03:35:06.839]  They go on to say, Romney said he was surprised at how the election was unfolding.
[03:35:07.399 --> 03:35:15.510]  He said he seriously considered entering himself in what would have been his third quest for the presidency, but he decided against it back in January.
[03:35:15.550 --> 03:35:17.152]  Now this was January of 2015.
[03:35:17.413 --> 03:35:18.114]  This is September 2015.
[03:35:20.817 --> 03:35:30.547]  And then he goes out and says after he speaks to everybody, a Washington Post reporter noted the continuing calls from Romney's friends to draft him into the race.
[03:35:30.607 --> 03:35:33.330]  And they asked whether his answer was a definitive no.
[03:35:33.951 --> 03:35:34.792]  And this is what he said.
[03:35:35.472 --> 03:35:39.036]  He said, you know, the unavailable is always the most interesting.
[03:35:39.076 --> 03:35:39.396]  I think?
[03:36:09.316 --> 03:36:09.596]  See that?
[03:36:10.017 --> 03:36:14.481]  Romney continues to capture the imagination of at least a portion of the Republican electorate.
[03:36:14.521 --> 03:36:21.827]  The 2016 presidential primaries reports Fox, their Salt Lake City establishment affiliate.
[03:36:22.067 --> 03:36:23.709]  Yeah, it's an establishment affiliate, okay.
[03:36:24.149 --> 03:36:29.534]  They say it's an increasingly marginalized group whose typical monitor becomes ironic by the day.
[03:36:30.094 --> 03:36:31.275]  The establishment.
[03:36:31.375 --> 03:36:32.996]  Yeah, that's the people that he runs for.
[03:36:33.136 --> 03:36:37.418]  Even Fox News people in Utah point that out.
[03:36:37.878 --> 03:36:44.301]  They say card-carrying establishment Republican John Sununu, of course he was with the George H.W.
[03:36:44.341 --> 03:36:52.805]  Bush administration from New Hampshire, former governor there, calls Trump the big mouth and says he has no idea if Romney will run, but it could happen.
[03:36:53.086 --> 03:36:53.866]  It could happen.
[03:36:53.886 --> 03:36:55.547]  That guy is a Bush insider.
[03:36:56.147 --> 03:36:57.990]  He says, look, it's a crazy season.
[03:36:58.050 --> 03:37:01.675]  Anything is possible, said Sununu in a live interview on CNN.
[03:37:01.715 --> 03:37:04.238]  All right, then let's go another couple of months.
[03:37:04.278 --> 03:37:06.401]  We go from November then to January.
[03:37:07.142 --> 03:37:07.763]  January 4th, 2016.
[03:37:07.943 --> 03:37:10.627]  The Deseret News in Utah.
[03:37:10.707 --> 03:37:12.109]  Mitt Romney says he's still
[03:37:12.489 --> 03:37:19.030]  He's being begged, I'm sorry, asked to run for president, even by another presidential candidate.
[03:37:19.450 --> 03:37:20.511]  Oh, this is interesting.
[03:37:20.571 --> 03:37:21.151]  Very interesting.
[03:37:21.191 --> 03:37:27.032]  He says, you know, every day, he tells the Washington Post, every day I get calls or letters.
[03:37:27.512 --> 03:37:29.373]  He says, I get harangued at church.
[03:37:29.393 --> 03:37:30.693]  He says, oh, you've got to run.
[03:37:30.993 --> 03:37:34.014]  He says, look, I even had one person who is running for president.
[03:37:34.054 --> 03:37:35.094]  I won't tell you who.
[03:37:35.976 --> 03:37:36.257]  Okay.
[03:37:36.537 --> 03:37:40.066]  He says, that person called me and said, I hope you don't close the door.
[03:37:40.547 --> 03:37:41.509]  We may need you.
[03:37:42.170 --> 03:37:43.654]  That's a person who's running for president.
[03:37:43.854 --> 03:37:46.079]  That's a person who's a candidate now, a Republican.
[03:37:47.225 --> 03:37:49.227]  I'm not giving it a second thought, he says.
[03:37:49.487 --> 03:37:50.487]  Yeah, we shall see.
[03:37:50.728 --> 03:37:51.148]  We shall see.
[03:37:51.208 --> 03:38:08.060]  So, against that backdrop of every couple of months throwing the bait out there, playing coy with the public, and then saying there are presidential candidates in the establishment that would really like to see him run, and of course they're playing this delegate game, trying to take this up to a brokered convention.
[03:38:09.061 --> 03:38:10.162]  And we know who the brokers want.
[03:38:11.158 --> 03:38:14.501]  I was listening to NPR, and they said, well, let's talk about a brokered convention.
[03:38:14.541 --> 03:38:15.001]  Ha ha ha.
[03:38:15.441 --> 03:38:17.243]  There are no more power brokers.
[03:38:17.303 --> 03:38:19.044]  And it's like, are you serious?
[03:38:19.545 --> 03:38:20.225]  Are you serious?
[03:38:20.525 --> 03:38:22.007]  I mean, just consider the source.
[03:38:22.487 --> 03:38:26.070]  Nationalist proletariat radio, okay?
[03:38:26.290 --> 03:38:26.870]  NPR.
[03:38:27.791 --> 03:38:31.215]  Telling us that there's no brokers at the conventions, okay?
[03:38:31.755 --> 03:38:32.316]  Seriously.
[03:38:32.696 --> 03:38:33.117]  Seriously.
[03:38:33.137 --> 03:38:33.437]  Alright.
[03:38:33.958 --> 03:38:36.901]  So, now we have this story that was on InfoWars.com on Monday.
[03:38:36.981 --> 03:38:43.809]  It was by Michael Snyder and it references what Roger Stone was saying on Friday, last Friday.
[03:38:44.329 --> 03:38:47.990]  Republican establishment is absolutely desperate to keep Donald Trump out of the White House.
[03:38:48.010 --> 03:38:49.851]  They'll do anything to do that.
[03:38:50.231 --> 03:38:54.613]  So at this point, there's two different plans being put forward on how to proceed if Trump continues to roll on.
[03:38:54.713 --> 03:38:58.774]  One is to have Marco Rubio exit the race so that Mitt Romney can run against Trump.
[03:38:58.814 --> 03:39:02.915]  The other is to run a third-party candidate against Trump and Clinton in the fall, okay?
[03:39:02.955 --> 03:39:09.498]  Maybe like Michael Bloomberg, although that wouldn't really work out too well for them, I think.
[03:39:09.518 --> 03:39:11.898]  In that situation, I think that would hurt Clinton.
[03:39:11.938 --> 03:39:13.039]  I don't think it would hurt Trump.
[03:39:13.559 --> 03:39:15.560]  But this is what Roger Stone said last Friday.
[03:39:15.580 --> 03:39:23.562]  He said, in a bitter fight for his life, establishment GOP leaders have decided to block Donald Trump's nomination at all costs, even if it means losing the presidency to Hillary Clinton.
[03:39:23.783 --> 03:39:25.083]  Now, why would they do that?
[03:39:25.203 --> 03:39:25.963]  Why would they do that?
[03:39:26.003 --> 03:39:33.186]  You know, this very first article that I had back in September, one of the things that Mitt Romney was saying to the Washington Post at the time was he said,
[03:39:33.886 --> 03:39:36.767]  We are harangued as the party of the rich.
[03:39:37.267 --> 03:39:39.367]  And of course, he's the poster child for that.
[03:39:40.608 --> 03:39:44.769]  Mr. Fighting Whitey is what he looks like, if you're familiar with those t-shirts.
[03:39:45.149 --> 03:39:47.309]  He just doesn't have the pipe there.
[03:39:48.229 --> 03:39:51.770]  But he says, the rich have gotten richer under President Obama.
[03:39:52.730 --> 03:39:57.672]  Let me explain to you, in case you don't know, we've talked about this in detail about NAFTA and other things, okay?
[03:39:57.852 --> 03:39:58.472]  It is not
[03:39:59.332 --> 03:40:00.913]  That it's Obama's policies.
[03:40:01.193 --> 03:40:07.235]  It's these globalist trade treaties like NAFTA that were put in by the Republicans and the Democrats.
[03:40:07.255 --> 03:40:14.938]  And if you go back and look at this, if you go back and look at that race, they wanted to make sure that they had a candidate, whether it was going to be George Bush, H.W.
[03:40:14.958 --> 03:40:16.399]  Bush, or whether it was going to be Bill Clinton.
[03:40:17.059 --> 03:40:18.800]  Both of them supported NAFTA.
[03:40:19.480 --> 03:40:24.264]  And you had the rise of Ross Perot saying, we can't do this, it will destroy the country.
[03:40:24.284 --> 03:40:27.246]  And he's been proven right in the 23 years that that's happened.
[03:40:27.626 --> 03:40:30.929]  But they would let everything else go on the margins.
[03:40:30.969 --> 03:40:33.191]  They had to get that through.
[03:40:33.271 --> 03:40:36.873]  So they made sure they had two candidates who were going to run that through regardless.
[03:40:37.354 --> 03:40:40.496]  Same thing happened with Mitt Romney and Obama four years ago.
[03:40:41.257 --> 03:40:44.840]  They needed somebody who was going to push through Obamacare or Romneycare.
[03:40:44.900 --> 03:40:48.823]  Because Mitt Romney had already done Obamacare in Massachusetts with Ted Kennedy.
[03:40:49.483 --> 03:40:52.066]  So they wanted two candidates who were going to push that through.
[03:40:52.527 --> 03:40:54.309]  What they want now is two candidates.
[03:40:54.369 --> 03:41:05.323]  If they can't get two candidates, they will close in behind Hillary Clinton because they want somebody who is going to open the borders, who's going to push through the climate treaty, who's going to push through the trade treaties,
[03:41:05.623 --> 03:41:06.224]  We're good to go.
[03:41:22.099 --> 03:41:28.321]  The only person who was allowed, only the senators and congressmen had access to look at it.
[03:41:28.822 --> 03:41:37.725]  They couldn't talk about it, but Senator Sessions saw it, and he's talking about it, and he's educated Donald Trump on it, and Donald Trump says not only is he going to stop that,
[03:41:38.385 --> 03:41:41.049]  He's going to reverse NAFTA as well.
[03:41:41.129 --> 03:41:42.270]  So that's what's going on here.
[03:41:42.351 --> 03:41:50.442]  So in the backdrop of all this, now we see that Mitt Romney is becoming increasingly visible, having more and more press conferences.
[03:41:50.502 --> 03:41:54.267]  And again, part of that revelation from Roger Stone was that they were going to
[03:41:55.188 --> 03:42:05.093]  Pull up $25 million, a group of Koch brothers and other GOP millionaires and billionaires met last Thursday night to pull together $75 million to stop Trump.
[03:42:05.493 --> 03:42:10.656]  He said they're going to use Mitt Romney as plan B if Rubio fails to gain traction on Super Tuesday.
[03:42:10.716 --> 03:42:19.301]  They gave him $25 million but said, hey, if you can't pull it through Mr. Bronze Medal, then we're going to pull the guy who has consistently lost.
[03:42:20.141 --> 03:42:22.182]  Uh, in these presidential elections.
[03:42:22.262 --> 03:42:23.423]  Mitt Romney, the loser.
[03:42:23.443 --> 03:42:27.265]  They're gonna pull up another loser as the other champion of the establishment.
[03:42:28.206 --> 03:42:32.728]  And so now we see that he's gonna be speaking now in a public forum, uh, University of Utah on Thursday.
[03:42:32.748 --> 03:42:37.911]  The Washington Post says GOP has two weeks to take down Donald Trump because that is the establishment.
[03:42:37.931 --> 03:42:45.495]  Why would they want to take down somebody who has, uh, done the best geographically, uh, of any candidate since 1960?
[03:42:46.676 --> 03:42:51.158]  You've never had a GOP candidate who has won over such a broad geographical range.
[03:42:51.218 --> 03:42:53.780]  Usually they have a very narrow geographical power base.
[03:42:54.160 --> 03:42:55.461]  He's winning every demographic.
[03:42:55.941 --> 03:43:03.565]  He's winning every geographical area, and yet they have to take him out because he opposes these trade deals.
[03:43:03.665 --> 03:43:04.725]  That's the real issue.
[03:43:05.026 --> 03:43:06.787]  Let me give you a chance to weigh in.
[03:43:06.827 --> 03:43:07.747]  Let's go to some of your calls.
[03:43:08.147 --> 03:43:09.328]  Tim in Wyoming, go ahead.
[03:43:12.363 --> 03:43:13.364]  Tim, are you there?
[03:43:13.384 --> 03:43:15.985]  Alright, let's go to Jim in West Virginia.
[03:43:16.365 --> 03:43:16.586]  Jim.
[03:43:18.307 --> 03:43:19.047]  Hello, am I there?
[03:43:19.307 --> 03:43:19.848]  Yes, you're there.
[03:43:20.568 --> 03:43:21.108]  Oh, very well.
[03:43:21.529 --> 03:43:23.890]  Okay, I think we need to call things what they are.
[03:43:24.270 --> 03:43:28.053]  These primary elections are not elections, let me explain.
[03:43:28.833 --> 03:43:30.874]  They are customer surveys.
[03:43:31.335 --> 03:43:31.595]  Yes.
[03:43:31.615 --> 03:43:35.157]  The Republican Party was formed in the 1850s and incorporated in 1860.
[03:43:35.857 --> 03:43:39.820]  By law, a corporation must do what its owners tell it to.
[03:43:40.902 --> 03:43:43.904]  Not what the employees or customers tell it to do.
[03:43:43.924 --> 03:43:49.027]  So basically that's what explains brokered conventions, superdelegates, and everything else.
[03:43:49.447 --> 03:43:50.708]  They are not elections.
[03:43:50.848 --> 03:43:51.408]  They are customers.
[03:43:51.729 --> 03:43:57.432]  And the thing that the RNC Chair Priebus said, they're auditioning to join us.
[03:43:58.533 --> 03:43:59.413]  It was pretty creepy.
[03:43:59.713 --> 03:44:00.874]  But it was very candid.
[03:44:01.014 --> 03:44:01.575]  Very candid.
[03:44:01.595 --> 03:44:02.415]  Amazingly candid.
[03:44:02.455 --> 03:44:02.935]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:44:02.955 --> 03:44:03.396]  I agree with you.
[03:44:04.136 --> 03:44:06.998]  From now on, I think we need to refer to both parties as the
[03:44:07.828 --> 03:44:10.210]  Republican Party Corporation.
[03:44:10.790 --> 03:44:10.990]  Yeah.
[03:44:11.451 --> 03:44:16.654]  Well, this gets back to the whole thing about, you know, whether we're operating under corporate rules or whether the Constitution is still in effect.
[03:44:16.674 --> 03:44:19.016]  Look, we understand that they are rigging everything.
[03:44:19.056 --> 03:44:20.457]  We understand they're rigging these elections.
[03:44:20.477 --> 03:44:22.519]  We understand they completely ignore the Constitution.
[03:44:23.099 --> 03:44:28.303]  But let's go with the assumption that the legitimate authority
[03:44:29.016 --> 03:44:36.579]  Okay, is the Constitution, and we are going to enforce legitimate authority, and I think that's the basis on which we need to proceed.
[03:44:36.619 --> 03:44:38.160]  We need to call their bluff on this.
[03:44:38.200 --> 03:44:42.321]  They've been using these things, you know, swearing obedience to the Constitution and so forth.
[03:44:42.882 --> 03:44:45.203]  Let's say, okay, yeah, that's right, you talk about that.
[03:44:45.523 --> 03:44:51.925]  That is legitimate authority, and if you're not going to obey it, you are not legitimate, and we are going to have legitimate authority.
[03:44:51.945 --> 03:44:53.546]  I think that's the way that we move forward.
[03:44:55.387 --> 03:45:00.314]  Because, basically, very, very simply, it's we, the people, who have to enforce our rights.
[03:45:01.095 --> 03:45:08.867]  Our Constitution turned us into a landslide, put a lot of observers at the polls, ex-pollers, makes them nervous.
[03:45:09.508 --> 03:45:10.289]  Keep it up, thanks.
[03:45:10.609 --> 03:45:17.931]  Or, thank you, yeah, exactly, like the story that I had about Robert Morrow, who just had a hostile takeover, and it wasn't by himself.
[03:45:18.052 --> 03:45:23.753]  He had 54% of the people who voted him in as the Republican chair of the Travis County GOP.
[03:45:23.793 --> 03:45:25.734]  That's the county here in Austin.
[03:45:25.794 --> 03:45:27.355]  Very important to do that.
[03:45:27.375 --> 03:45:28.215]  Let's take another call.
[03:45:28.275 --> 03:45:31.936]  Now, before I run out of time, I do want to talk about what's going on in Utah.
[03:45:31.956 --> 03:45:33.077]  But go ahead, let's take one more call.
[03:45:33.697 --> 03:45:34.697]  Mike in South Carolina.
[03:45:34.717 --> 03:45:37.318]  Go ahead, Mike.
[03:45:38.792 --> 03:45:39.372]  Hi David.
[03:45:40.193 --> 03:45:49.117]  I just wanted to talk about, you're talking about Rubio as the stalking horse and I'm talking about the mainstream media absolutely trying to vilify Trump today.
[03:45:49.217 --> 03:45:55.861]  I'm looking at CNBC and every story that they've got is why Trump can't be president.
[03:45:56.301 --> 03:45:58.502]  Trump is like a kindergartner on China.
[03:45:59.903 --> 03:46:00.243]  Also,
[03:46:02.114 --> 03:46:09.203]  Unbeknownst, nobody's made mention of it, that wholesale gasoline went up 30 cents a gallon over the weekend.
[03:46:09.223 --> 03:46:10.705]  It was down as low as 86 cents a gallon.
[03:46:15.709 --> 03:46:17.070]  Over the week on Friday, it was $1.02.
[03:46:17.130 --> 03:46:22.134]  It went up to $1.32 and nobody ever mentioned it.
[03:46:22.854 --> 03:46:28.919]  And CNBC changed their charts so that it doesn't reflect the fact that it ever went under a dollar.
[03:46:29.720 --> 03:46:38.687]  And also, Aubrey McClendon, the former CEO of Chesapeake Energy, supposedly just suicided himself yesterday.
[03:46:39.587 --> 03:46:40.848]  Wow, that's interesting.
[03:46:42.293 --> 03:46:42.574]  Yeah.
[03:46:42.874 --> 03:46:44.959]  Dr. Carson suspended his campaign.
[03:46:45.059 --> 03:46:46.502]  He just suspended his campaign.
[03:46:46.542 --> 03:46:47.143]  He just did.
[03:46:47.223 --> 03:46:48.065]  Okay, I didn't see that.
[03:46:48.125 --> 03:46:49.769]  I don't have a news feed up here at the moment.
[03:46:49.789 --> 03:46:50.009]  Yeah.
[03:46:50.632 --> 03:46:52.273]  Well, I'm sad to see him go out.
[03:46:52.293 --> 03:46:53.835]  I think he did an honorable campaign.
[03:46:53.995 --> 03:46:59.119]  I think on pretty much everything, though, outside of Obamacare, he was really kind of out of his depth.
[03:46:59.539 --> 03:47:02.942]  You know, he really, I don't think, had prepared enough on a lot of different issues.
[03:47:03.642 --> 03:47:07.866]  What we would hear from him in many cases was the same thing we hear from a lot of candidates.
[03:47:07.906 --> 03:47:14.251]  Well, I will talk to, I'll get experts around me and I will rely on their advice.
[03:47:14.331 --> 03:47:15.572]  It's like, well, actually we were looking
[03:47:16.252 --> 03:47:18.594]  To you for some leadership on some issues.
[03:47:18.614 --> 03:47:19.955]  You know, what are your core issues?
[03:47:19.995 --> 03:47:20.576]  Why are you running?
[03:47:21.016 --> 03:47:22.317]  So I'm sorry to see that happen.
[03:47:22.638 --> 03:47:25.660]  Everybody in the campaign was very very pessimistic last night.
[03:47:26.701 --> 03:47:29.563]  He was a real nice guy, and so we wish him well.
[03:47:30.744 --> 03:47:35.849]  Before we go to some more phone calls, I want to talk about this situation that's going on in Utah.
[03:47:36.789 --> 03:47:39.572]  You know, you hear the phrase posse comitatus.
[03:47:41.195 --> 03:47:50.442]  And typically we think of the Posse Comitatus Act, which is an act that limits the power of the federal government to use the federal military to enact domestic policy.
[03:47:50.562 --> 03:47:51.122]  Think about that.
[03:47:51.603 --> 03:47:56.967]  We don't want a military coming into our communities.
[03:47:57.567 --> 03:47:58.728]  We don't want soldiers.
[03:47:58.748 --> 03:48:00.249]  We don't want martial law.
[03:48:00.389 --> 03:48:03.411]  Okay, that's why we have the Posse Comitatus Act.
[03:48:04.272 --> 03:48:06.454]  But what does Posse Comitatus really mean?
[03:48:06.514 --> 03:48:09.336]  It literally means the power of the county.
[03:48:10.782 --> 03:48:13.843]  The sheriff of the county would call a posse.
[03:48:13.883 --> 03:48:15.284]  We've all seen the westerns, right?
[03:48:15.964 --> 03:48:32.831]  You have the sheriff who was elected, not appointed by some kind of law enforcement bureaucracy, not appointed by some distant federal government that is as far distant geographically as the British government was geographically from the American colonies at the time of the Revolutionary War.
[03:48:33.669 --> 03:48:41.330]  Not as distant from us in terms of political goals as the British were from the Americans at the time of the Revolutionary War.
[03:48:41.350 --> 03:48:43.911]  But they did not want to have a standing military.
[03:48:44.311 --> 03:48:49.172]  They didn't want to have a military that was going to come in and enforce policy in the area.
[03:48:49.732 --> 03:48:55.113]  So law enforcement was centered around one elected official and some of his permanent deputies.
[03:48:55.633 --> 03:49:00.374]  But when something big would happen, they would deputize people and they would create a posse.
[03:49:00.994 --> 03:49:03.516]  To keep the peace in the county.
[03:49:03.536 --> 03:49:04.376]  Okay?
[03:49:04.416 --> 03:49:05.317]  That was the plan.
[03:49:05.837 --> 03:49:08.118]  Not that we would have a permanent standing army.
[03:49:08.138 --> 03:49:09.699]  And you understand, I've mentioned this before.
[03:49:10.580 --> 03:49:23.107]  If you look at law enforcement in the United States, there are only three countries that have a larger military than the law enforcement military that we have in this country.
[03:49:24.415 --> 03:49:26.636]  One of them is the United States military.
[03:49:26.856 --> 03:49:32.459]  So we have two of the largest four militaries in the world when you look at it that way.
[03:49:32.499 --> 03:49:38.483]  We have the real military and we have the military of law enforcement and the military of the federal bureaucracy.
[03:49:38.943 --> 03:49:45.987]  We have even the Department of Education creating SWAT teams and coming after people for delinquent student loans.
[03:49:47.065 --> 03:49:55.672]  Now, against this backdrop, against the backdrop of things that we've seen at the Bundy Ranch at Oregon and the many other cases that we've talked about, here's one in Utah.
[03:49:56.052 --> 03:49:57.453]  Paiute County, Utah.
[03:49:57.974 --> 03:50:03.778]  The second smallest county by population in Utah is making a lot of noise in the western land movement these days.
[03:50:03.818 --> 03:50:07.681]  This is a story from FOX 13 out of Utah.
[03:50:08.121 --> 03:50:13.506]  It's a longtime rancher, Stanton Gleave, is at the center of a conflict that includes the county sheriff on one side, the U.S.
[03:50:13.526 --> 03:50:14.626]  Forest Service on the other.
[03:50:15.447 --> 03:50:23.810]  He wore his cowboy hat, he held up a pocket constitution, as he spoke with the Rural Caucus of the Utah State Legislature on February the 12th.
[03:50:24.330 --> 03:50:29.692]  He said, these federal people have no right to be here if you follow the Constitution.
[03:50:30.373 --> 03:50:35.995]  And the Paiute County Sheriff, Marty Gleave, said, we're not taking no more cuts on the mountain.
[03:50:36.195 --> 03:50:41.497]  I'll deputize every man, woman, and child in the county to stop what's going on.
[03:50:42.423 --> 03:50:46.587]  Now, we're going to tell you what's going on out west when we come back.
[03:50:47.188 --> 03:50:48.349]  Why this is brewing.
[03:50:48.730 --> 03:50:50.051]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:50:50.091 --> 03:50:54.416]  And don't forget, we have a flash sale, 50% off, on colloidal silver.
[03:50:54.516 --> 03:50:55.477]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:51:02.918 --> 03:51:10.945]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:11.626 --> 03:51:12.366]  What did I do?
[03:51:13.107 --> 03:51:20.433]  I created ExtendoVite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.

[03:52:34.969 --> 03:52:37.652]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[03:52:38.352 --> 03:52:39.152]  We're good to go.
[03:53:02.299 --> 03:53:09.164]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[03:53:09.324 --> 03:53:13.748]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.
[03:53:13.968 --> 03:53:24.456]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary, broad-spectrum, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal solution that can be used inside the body as well as on the skin.
[03:53:24.736 --> 03:53:38.334]  Supernatural silver is unique and superior to colloidal and ionic silvers, using a patented technology that is highly effective against colds, flus, infections, food poisoning, and yeast, in addition to many other pathogens.
[03:53:38.674 --> 03:53:41.898]  Supernatural silver is scientifically supported.
[03:53:42.099 --> 03:53:43.040]  Extremely safe.
[03:53:43.140 --> 03:53:43.601]  We're good.
[03:54:05.294 --> 03:54:07.796]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[03:54:08.276 --> 03:54:11.598]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:54:11.798 --> 03:54:15.401]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:15.421 --> 03:54:20.224]  I want to get through this report about what's happening out in Utah and give you some more background on this.
[03:54:20.244 --> 03:54:24.327]  I'm going to try to get to some phone calls, I'm not sure if I can, for those of you who are on the line.
[03:54:24.807 --> 03:54:28.369]  And real quickly, before we get back to the news, I just want to let you know about the flash sale.
[03:54:28.790 --> 03:54:30.511]  It's a very limited time, only 50% off.
[03:54:32.472 --> 03:54:33.892]  Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver.
[03:54:33.972 --> 03:54:36.053]  That's our 30 parts per million formulation.
[03:54:36.073 --> 03:54:39.233]  About three times stronger than most colloidal silver out there.

[03:54:46.134 --> 03:54:55.916]  We have sold out of many products with our leap year sale but we still have Silver Bullet in and we're offering it at an unprecedented 50% off at Infowarslife.com.
[03:54:55.956 --> 03:54:58.096]  This is a flash sale for a limited time.
[03:54:58.236 --> 03:54:59.237]  Only 50% off.
[03:54:59.617 --> 03:55:01.257]  Silver Bullet at Infowarslife.com.
[03:55:02.344 --> 03:55:24.389]  I was just talking about the story that Rob Jacobson showed me about this sheriff out in Utah who is upset with the Forest Service, just like others have been upset with the BLM, these different federal government agencies that are essentially militarizing the law enforcement in these areas, exceeding their authority, talking about how he is going to deputize every single
[03:55:24.969 --> 03:55:28.752]  Man, woman and child in the county if necessary to stop what they're doing to them.
[03:55:29.232 --> 03:55:39.080]  Understand that is the authority of the sheriff to conscript able-bodied men to assist in keeping the peace and to underscore the power of the community.
[03:55:39.120 --> 03:55:40.521]  That's what posse comitatus means.
[03:55:41.161 --> 03:55:51.529]  We have the Posse Comitatus Act that said the federal government will not be allowed to use the military to enact federal policies domestically, okay?
[03:55:51.749 --> 03:55:56.834]  Let's go back to this report, again from Utah, the Deseret News, back in June of 2014.
[03:55:56.914 --> 03:56:00.717]  This is another sheriff, Garfield County Sheriff Danny Perkins.
[03:56:01.297 --> 03:56:06.740]  He's talking about the frustrations that he has out there working with the BLM.
[03:56:06.760 --> 03:56:09.102]  He said, we have absolutely no relationship with the BLM.
[03:56:09.122 --> 03:56:09.722]  We've tried.
[03:56:10.022 --> 03:56:11.904]  They seem to want to do their own thing.
[03:56:12.224 --> 03:56:14.745]  They do not respect the authority of the sheriff at all.
[03:56:15.146 --> 03:56:19.989]  It's hard for them to accept that the sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer in this county.
[03:56:20.369 --> 03:56:22.070]  He says, we've got many examples of abuse.
[03:56:22.210 --> 03:56:30.075]  And this, listen, militarization of the government agencies is a real problem, said Garfield County Commissioner Leland Pollack.
[03:56:30.615 --> 03:56:32.396]  Who also traveled to Washington D.C.
[03:56:32.436 --> 03:56:33.177]  to talk about this.
[03:56:33.217 --> 03:56:38.300]  He says, if this guy does something that blows up, we're all going to be on TV.
[03:56:38.340 --> 03:56:40.722]  This is a scary scenario, especially in rural areas.
[03:56:40.742 --> 03:56:43.524]  Well, the guy he's referring to is, guess who?
[03:56:44.064 --> 03:56:46.346]  Special Agent in Charge Dan Love.
[03:56:46.366 --> 03:56:47.266]  Remember that name?
[03:56:47.587 --> 03:56:49.028]  From the Bundy Ranch standoff?
[03:56:49.608 --> 03:56:51.449]  Dan Love was the guy who was in charge.
[03:56:51.969 --> 03:57:00.052]  And there, they're saying that he, they accused him, in that county, in Utah, of spreading a culture of dismissiveness and arrogance towards his co-workers.
[03:57:00.092 --> 03:57:06.015]  They say, and this is a quote from Pollack, the county commissioner, is create a situation where they thumb their noses at us.
[03:57:06.883 --> 03:57:09.045]  And this starts at the top.
[03:57:09.866 --> 03:57:11.067]  Starts at the top, okay?
[03:57:11.467 --> 03:57:15.651]  And they're talking about the anxiety over armed federal regulatory agencies is not unique to Utah.
[03:57:15.711 --> 03:57:21.597]  They say Representative Chris Stewart from Utah points out incidences that have happened in Los Angeles.
[03:57:21.957 --> 03:57:25.359]  As well as to mining operations all the way up to Alaska.
[03:57:25.419 --> 03:57:33.385]  He unveiled legislation that aimed to demilitarize federal regulatory agencies, prevent them from having armed SWAT teams.
[03:57:33.465 --> 03:57:38.108]  He says, I understand they need to be able to protect themselves, but this goes way, way beyond that.
[03:57:38.588 --> 03:57:42.751]  Let's go back to the charges against Cliven Bundy when he was arrested.
[03:57:43.311 --> 03:57:48.612]  The New American had an article at the time, and I've been meaning to talk about this for quite some time, but so many other pieces of news come in.
[03:57:48.853 --> 03:57:52.213]  Cliven Bundy was charged with multiple counts of conspiracy.
[03:57:52.233 --> 03:57:56.695]  But what about when the court charges a BLM with conspiracy?
[03:57:57.255 --> 03:58:01.336]  You've got the sheriff in Clark County, who was the sheriff when this standoff was going on.
[03:58:01.496 --> 03:58:03.699]  Talking about how the BLM lied to him.
[03:58:03.959 --> 03:58:05.501]  He said that in February.

[03:58:20.620 --> 03:58:32.533]  Those conspiracies go unheeded, just as the crimes by Hillary Clinton go unheeded, as the FBI is manic to set up a surveillance of all iPhones.
