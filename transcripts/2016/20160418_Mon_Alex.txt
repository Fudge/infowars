[00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.853]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:08.853 --> 00:00:19.199]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.359]  Wow!
[00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:26.822]  We've got even more news stacked on the desk here today that needs to be covered than normal.
[00:00:26.822 --> 00:00:29.604]  And a normal day is a total information awareness overload.
[00:00:30.578 --> 00:00:37.407]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen I'm Alex Jones your host we're going to be live here for the next four hours today as we are every weekday 11 a.m.
[00:00:37.407 --> 00:00:38.068]  to 3 p.m.
[00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:47.821]  Central Standard Time we have Wayne Madsen investigative journalist on a whole bunch of huge fronts joining us in the second hour Richard Reeves pops in our
[00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:57.309]  Also during the second hour, Lou Rockwell on the big theft of the 2016 election, not just from Donald Trump, but from Bernie Sanders as well.
[00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:10.219]  And then of course we have Paul Joseph Watson from England, who will be hosting the fourth hour of the Nightly News Returns this evening, seven o'clock Central Standard Time.
[00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:11.921]  I really need to focus in, though,
[00:01:13.436 --> 00:01:22.479]  Not on man-made things some, but on just the volatile universe, the ever-changing universe that we live in.
[00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:41.125]  Because tectonic activity right now, depending on which seismologist you read or which publication you look at, but they're pretty much all lining up now, agreeing that this is the most seismic activity ever recorded since they began to record globally about a hundred years ago.
[00:01:42.964 --> 00:01:59.737]  From Yellowstone, in the heart of our nation, to the Great Ring of Fire around the Pacific Ocean, things are extremely volatile right now.
[00:01:59.737 --> 00:02:09.504]  Huge earthquakes just all over the world yesterday, and the day before that, and the day before that, there were just giant earthquakes happening all over the planet.
[00:02:10.598 --> 00:02:23.854]  And so I almost need to carve out some time away from 2016 and the election and all the war news and the economic news in the next few days to get Standeo and others on.
[00:02:23.854 --> 00:02:29.541]  We had Standeo on three years ago and again about six months ago and he predicted
[00:02:31.727 --> 00:02:36.493]  That in the next year we would see the most tectonic activity we've ever seen.
[00:02:36.493 --> 00:02:37.535]  He's a really smart guy.
[00:02:37.535 --> 00:02:39.557]  In fact, they just put on the screen for me.
[00:02:39.557 --> 00:02:40.058]  I didn't know.
[00:02:40.058 --> 00:02:41.139]  Thanks for telling me.
[00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:42.321]  This was just set up this morning.
[00:02:42.321 --> 00:02:44.483]  Stan Dale will be on for over an hour.
[00:02:44.483 --> 00:02:46.867]  Always informative on Wednesday.
[00:02:48.712 --> 00:02:52.733]  And he's a geologist and a lot more, but I should probably get George Nori on.
[00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:58.795]  He's somebody that's really been focused on this and been predicting a lot of this because of all the expert guests he's had on.
[00:02:58.795 --> 00:03:17.800]  And, you know, George has his fun shows, as he calls them, Ghost to Ghost, around Halloween, and, you know, some of the shows that are more in the fiction realm, but he's the guy that took that broadcast, so I don't want to go off on a jag about this, from 80% chupacabras and space aliens to 80% private Federal Reserve, New World Order, world government.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:28.694]  And so we all owe him a continued debt of gratitude that that broadcast is there and as ever popular as always, really informing a lot of people.
[00:03:28.694 --> 00:03:31.537]  But I digress down a rabbit trail with that.
[00:03:31.537 --> 00:03:34.982]  We're going to be getting some more guests on this week also discussing it.
[00:03:36.724 --> 00:03:48.852]  And I'm not a Planet X guy, but there are a lot of big planets out in the Kuiper Belt, out past Pluto, and there is now a big one coming through the solar system, which a lot of ancient societies predicted would show up about now.
[00:03:48.852 --> 00:03:55.676]  What I don't like is, ever since I've been on air for 20 years, people are always telling me that Planet X is imminent, it's going to destroy the Earth.
[00:03:57.042 --> 00:03:57.963]  And then it never happens.
[00:03:57.963 --> 00:04:01.885]  It's a way to sell a book perennially every single year.
[00:04:01.885 --> 00:04:02.826]  And I just don't go there.
[00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:04.007]  But there are big comets.
[00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:05.408]  There are big planetoids.
[00:04:05.408 --> 00:04:10.451]  There is a big gas giant coming through that is in mainstream media.
[00:04:14.138 --> 00:04:23.068]  That is in mainstream media, but not really getting a lot of the attention that it deserves.
[00:04:23.068 --> 00:04:28.875]  So that is coming up as well today.
[00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:30.216]  Mustache.
[00:04:30.216 --> 00:04:32.439]  What do they call those little mustaches that are under your lip?
[00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.610]  Van Dyke.
[00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.911]  A Van Dyke.
[00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:37.331]  I got some black ink on my finger.
[00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:39.532]  I have a... I'm trendy now.
[00:04:39.532 --> 00:04:41.132]  I have a Van Dyke.
[00:04:41.132 --> 00:04:42.112]  That's really what matters.
[00:04:42.112 --> 00:04:46.854]  Let's come back for the next four hours and talk about different type of facial hair.
[00:04:46.854 --> 00:04:47.574]  Like, do you like it?
[00:04:47.574 --> 00:04:48.754]  Do you dislike it?
[00:04:48.754 --> 00:04:50.175]  What do you think of a Van Dyke?
[00:04:50.175 --> 00:04:55.736]  What's it mean when a woman has a big handlebar... handlebar mustache?
[00:04:55.736 --> 00:04:57.077]  She's a handlebar.
[00:04:57.077 --> 00:04:58.357]  See, I'm inventing new terms here.
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:06.924]  Nearly 40 volcanoes are currently erupting across the world, and scientists warn that the current conditions could trigger at least four record-breaking earthquakes.
[00:05:06.924 --> 00:05:14.507]  The earthquakes that just hit recently have left over 270 dead in Ecuador and over 42 dead in Japan, with mass evacuations continuing out of fear of aftershocks.
[00:05:14.507 --> 00:05:23.311]  And scientists at Tokyo University estimate there's at least a 70% chance that Japan will eventually suffer from another earthquake equivalent to the Great Kanto of 1923, which measured 8.9 and killed over 142,000 people.
[00:05:26.513 --> 00:05:33.615]  And other scientists also fear a full-blown eruption of the Yellowstone National Park volcano, which could have up to 2,000 times the power of the Mount St.
[00:05:33.615 --> 00:05:34.455]  Helens eruption of 1980.
[00:05:34.455 --> 00:05:42.777]  Some even speculate that the volcanic winter resulting from a Yellowstone eruption could devastate America's food supply and could even cool the planet 20 degrees.
[00:05:42.777 --> 00:05:45.858]  The volcanic ash could even blanket areas a thousand miles away.
[00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:48.079]  There's already signs an eruption could happen.
[00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:54.022]  A few weeks ago, a river near the Super Volcano started to boil, and the volcano itself is blasting out even more steam than before.
[00:05:54.022 --> 00:05:57.683]  For more news, visit InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.TV.

[00:06:59.315 --> 00:07:03.116]  Anthony Gucciardi here with an InfoWars health news update with Alex Jones.
[00:07:03.116 --> 00:07:04.077]  That's right, Anthony.
[00:07:04.077 --> 00:07:07.018]  One of our top-selling products is BrainForce.
[00:07:07.018 --> 00:07:11.339]  It is very affordably priced at retail, but we normally discount it.
[00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:20.983]  We've discounted from the discount 25%, but if you count it from its regular price, that's 45% discount for a limited time at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:20.983 --> 00:07:26.805]  There are a lot of brain boosters out there, or what's known as nootropics, but here's what separates BrainForce from the rest.
[00:07:27.105 --> 00:07:38.897]  Unlike some energy drinks and supplements, Brain Force uses natural brain activation ingredients like Yerba Mate Extract, Alpha-GPC, L-Theanine, Hyperzine A, Phosphatidylserine, B12, and many others.
[00:07:38.897 --> 00:07:44.302]  Major nutraceutical review sites rave about this formulation, and they also rave about the price.
[00:07:44.522 --> 00:07:56.194]  Secure your BrainForce today at InfoWarsLife.com and get 45% off retail, 25% off the regular sales price on BrainForce for a limited time at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:11.777]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:08:11.777 --> 00:08:13.358]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:08:13.358 --> 00:08:28.226]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:28.226 --> 00:08:28.907]  It's Monday.
[00:08:29.818 --> 00:08:31.399]  The 18th day of April 2016.
[00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:34.320]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.921]  We're going to be here until 3 o'clock Central Standard Time today.
[00:08:38.921 --> 00:08:43.383]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:43.383 --> 00:08:47.204]  Alright, obviously there is massive election 2016 news.
[00:08:47.204 --> 00:08:49.125]  There is huge military news.
[00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:54.827]  There is incredibly important geopolitical, military, and financial news that ties together.
[00:08:55.936 --> 00:09:03.523]  There is unprecedented leftist censorship going on around the world as well.
[00:09:03.523 --> 00:09:06.946]  And we're going to be breaking all of that down today.
[00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:10.990]  The fate of Obama's immigration plan is in the hands of the Supreme Court.
[00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.112]  We're going to be looking at that.
[00:09:13.112 --> 00:09:18.858]  The State Department wants to speed up the process of bringing Syrian refugees into the United States.
[00:09:20.276 --> 00:09:26.240]  A new AOL poll shows nearly half of Sanders supporters might switch to Trump.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:32.964]  There's a lot of top Democrats and others coming out saying that Hillary's so corrupt that if Sanders loses, they're going to go with Trump.
[00:09:32.964 --> 00:09:34.905]  So I do bash Sanders supporters.
[00:09:34.905 --> 00:09:38.367]  I do dislike socialism and communism.
[00:09:38.367 --> 00:09:44.870]  But that said, a lot of people are so anti-establishment, they're going for Sanders just as a desperation move.
[00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.912]  A lot of Ron Paul supporters are supporting him.
[00:09:47.919 --> 00:10:02.625]  And so regardless what you think of Sanders, I think that's a smart move by Sanders supporters watching him be robbed, but he isn't winning by as much or wasn't winning by as much, so it's easier to steal from him.
[00:10:02.625 --> 00:10:09.287]  It's a smart move to understand that Trump is also anti-establishment and that the power structure is coming after him.
[00:10:09.287 --> 00:10:13.929]  And so it's very, very important to get behind Donald Trump, even if you have issues with him.
[00:10:13.929 --> 00:10:16.110]  The fact that the globalist controllers
[00:10:17.102 --> 00:10:35.497]  are so scared illustrates the fact that they've already hijacked the nation and they don't like anybody talking about the fact that they've set up a lot of unfair deals that have put America at a disadvantage by design to de-industrialize us and to consolidate control over our lives.
[00:10:35.497 --> 00:10:41.302]  And coming up, Donald Trump has said, quote, we have the video clip, I'm so happy China is upset.
[00:10:41.302 --> 00:10:43.784]  They have waged economic war against us.
[00:10:45.555 --> 00:10:48.996]  And I'm glad Trump talks like that now, because I know he knows what's going on.
[00:10:48.996 --> 00:10:56.159]  Previously he would say that they're smarter than us, their leaders are smarter than our leaders, and that we've made some really bad deals.
[00:10:56.159 --> 00:10:57.739]  No.
[00:10:57.739 --> 00:11:02.061]  Globalists like Henry Kissinger and the Bushes, Bush was the, Bush Sr.
[00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:13.905]  was the first ambassador to China, and once it opened back up, they made deals, one-sided factory deals, to pass regulations in America prohibiting industry here.
[00:11:14.838 --> 00:11:15.478]  We're good to go.
[00:11:25.407 --> 00:11:33.332]  Slave plantation model labeled communism to leverage out all competition globally.
[00:11:33.332 --> 00:11:39.935]  This is economic warfare and I've been hammering that for 21 years on air because that's what it is.
[00:11:39.935 --> 00:11:42.617]  Globalism is economic warfare.
[00:11:42.617 --> 00:11:47.760]  It is a modern form of corporate colonialism.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.461]  Corporate monopoly.
[00:11:51.567 --> 00:11:52.808]  Colonialism.
[00:11:52.808 --> 00:11:55.669]  And by the way, I've coined all these terms that are now in use.
[00:11:55.669 --> 00:11:56.670]  I'm not bragging.
[00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.011]  I'm just showing the power of the truth.
[00:11:59.011 --> 00:12:09.057]  The power of people finally hearing the truth and then historically looking at definitions and realizing that they are establishing neo-feudalistic global fascism.
[00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:13.950]  Labeled as socialism and communism at the grassroots level.
[00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:17.051]  The name of the game is domestication of the population.
[00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:18.352]  Making you dependent.
[00:12:18.352 --> 00:12:38.918]  Putting you into an artificial system so you can't survive outside of a quote modern smart grid that is really a AI high-tech artificially intelligent false creation template that is a proto-matrix type human soul-destroying machine.
[00:12:41.852 --> 00:12:44.713]  We're gonna get to all of that today.
[00:12:44.713 --> 00:12:47.875]  We're gonna get to even foreign newspapers and even major U.S.
[00:12:47.875 --> 00:12:52.037]  papers going, look, you're supposed to have voters in primaries.
[00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:54.058]  You've never done anything like this before.
[00:12:54.058 --> 00:12:56.520]  This is unprecedented.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:01.882]  And the worst part is Ted Cruz keeps talking about the popular vote, landslides, and voters.
[00:13:01.882 --> 00:13:04.103]  And I talked about this two weeks ago.
[00:13:04.103 --> 00:13:10.467]  I said, he keeps saying, I've got grassroots, I've got democracy, I've got the vote, and Trump's a sore loser.
[00:13:11.522 --> 00:13:17.967]  And Fox News and CNN won't ever say what Trump is being a sore loser about.
[00:13:17.967 --> 00:13:25.252]  They're now trimming Trump down, folks, so that people don't know exactly what's happening.
[00:13:25.252 --> 00:13:39.162]  But if you actually go look at what's happened in Wyoming this weekend, and in Colorado, and in Georgia, and in Tennessee, and in Arizona, and Louisiana, they either steal delegates after Trump wins and give them to Ted Cruz,
[00:13:40.675 --> 00:13:46.496]  Or, they just cancel it outright, and the whole world sees that and goes, wait a minute.
[00:13:46.496 --> 00:14:08.702]  You're trying to run a PSYOP where you look at people with a straight face, a psychological operation, and you say, listen, there was never a vote, get used to it, and Priebus, and Curly Hewland, and all of them keep going on TV, smiling with Cheshire Cat, you-know-what-eating grins, laughing at you, trying to act as confident as they can.
[00:14:10.219 --> 00:14:23.570]  Like walking in, you get home from work early, your wife is in the bed, there's no sheets, your neighbor is right there, plain as day, on top of your wife.
[00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:37.962]  And he gets up, naked as a jaybird in front of you, starts putting on his pants and he says, Mr. Brown, Mr. Sanchez, Mr. Johnson, whatever your name is, I was just helping your wife put her shoes on.
[00:14:39.721 --> 00:14:41.121]  And she goes, that's right, honey.
[00:14:41.121 --> 00:14:43.922]  He was just helping with sweat running down her.
[00:14:43.922 --> 00:14:45.802]  Folks, that's how dumb they think we are.
[00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:48.283]  And I hate to use an allegory or an analogy like that.
[00:14:48.283 --> 00:14:52.564]  It's a family show, but that's what's going on here.
[00:14:52.564 --> 00:14:56.745]  Except it's not just cheating, you know, with your wife in front of you.
[00:14:56.745 --> 00:14:58.685]  They're robbing your whole future.
[00:14:58.685 --> 00:15:03.346]  This is 21st century, fourth, fifth generation conquest.
[00:15:03.346 --> 00:15:04.987]  This is warfare.
[00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:06.747]  And Donald Trump's saying this is warfare.
[00:15:07.677 --> 00:15:15.362]  The Chinese president, the Chinese head of trade, the Chinese censorship board have all come out and called him Hitler.
[00:15:15.362 --> 00:15:23.108]  These are people with mobile execution vans that sell peaceful, not even Zen Buddhists.
[00:15:23.108 --> 00:15:25.609]  The Falun Gong aren't even religious.
[00:15:25.609 --> 00:15:28.431]  You can argue, well, Buddhism isn't a religion, it's a philosophy.
[00:15:28.431 --> 00:15:30.693]  It's a religion, okay?
[00:15:30.693 --> 00:15:35.616]  And it's also a very peaceful religion historically and has a lot of tenets that I find admirable.
[00:15:35.616 --> 00:15:36.477]  I'm not a Buddhist.
[00:15:37.859 --> 00:15:40.661]  But the point is, this is one of the most peaceful groups of people there are.
[00:15:40.661 --> 00:15:54.048]  They're into not eating unhealthily, not drinking, and exercising, and so they are perfect for organ harvesting.
[00:15:54.048 --> 00:15:59.852]  And you have people selling peaceful political dissonance who get caught practicing their
[00:16:00.948 --> 00:16:02.068]  Religion.
[00:16:02.068 --> 00:16:10.590]  And the reason I was pointing out that Buddhism is a religion in my view, though they say it isn't, when you get down to Falun Gong, they've trimmed it back so much that it's not even a religion.
[00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:18.592]  It's like an exercise, relaxation, health practice.
[00:16:18.592 --> 00:16:21.113]  And they are killing them
[00:16:23.331 --> 00:16:26.273]  On record and advertising that they, quote, have fresh organs.
[00:16:26.273 --> 00:16:30.056]  That's how they translate it in the Chinese communist publications.
[00:16:30.056 --> 00:16:38.462]  And then, again, they take your organs on the way to the airport so they're totally fresh, put them on ice, fly the hour flight into Tokyo, and implant most of the organs right there.
[00:16:38.462 --> 00:16:42.706]  And there's a huge tourism, medical tourism trade to go over there.
[00:16:42.706 --> 00:16:43.806]  And they have the nerve.
[00:16:43.806 --> 00:16:46.669]  This is just one of the huge crimes China commits.
[00:16:47.782 --> 00:16:54.066]  The suicide nets, the forced abortions, the infanticide, the one-child policy, on and on.
[00:16:54.066 --> 00:17:00.211]  The 84 million killed by Mao Zedong alone during his nightmare.
[00:17:00.211 --> 00:17:02.292]  What was his reign?
[00:17:02.292 --> 00:17:03.833]  Officially over China, 49 until the late 70s.
[00:17:06.664 --> 00:17:08.445]  Under him, 84 million?
[00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:10.485]  The Chinese government admits?
[00:17:10.485 --> 00:17:16.307]  You guys killed probably, just under Mao, four or five times what Hitler did?
[00:17:16.307 --> 00:17:21.868]  Three times what Stalin and Lenin did together?
[00:17:21.868 --> 00:17:28.330]  You are the heavyweight champion mass murderers of world history, of your own people.
[00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.431]  Most of them didn't even resist you.
[00:17:33.826 --> 00:17:39.837]  And then you get up in the whole political correct racket and tell us Donald Trump is Hitler.
[00:17:39.837 --> 00:17:44.306]  And let's get down to what the Ford Foundation is really saying there when they put that talking point out.
[00:17:44.306 --> 00:17:46.229]  They're saying if you're white, you're Hitler.
[00:17:48.752 --> 00:17:55.760]  Just like Obama said, sorry, I'm trying to appoint a white guy who's a horrible anti-gunner, even worse than Kagan and Sotomayor in many ways.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.603]  I'm sorry he's white, but he's the best jurist for the job.
[00:17:58.603 --> 00:18:03.708]  Again, the idea that white people are inherently bad, that's all they're selling is total balkanization.
[00:18:04.389 --> 00:18:12.396]  Get in everybody's throat because we're bringing in hundreds of thousands of non-vetted refugees where they don't even check their IDs or passports in many cases.
[00:18:12.396 --> 00:18:16.820]  They won't even give the state governors their names, the state police their names for a database.
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:23.245]  The feds just turn them loose, millions of them in Europe, and he says you gotta stop everybody coming in until we start vetting them again.
[00:18:23.245 --> 00:18:28.470]  Yeah, close the border till we turn the vetting back on that Obama's order turned off and they spin that.
[00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.292]  I saw an article in USA Today, I saw another one.
[00:18:32.193 --> 00:18:36.555]  This morning in CNN about why New Yorkers are rejecting Trump.
[00:18:36.555 --> 00:18:38.255]  Yeah, that's why he's about to win by 60 points.
[00:18:38.255 --> 00:18:44.737]  It was like, well, this guy from Italy who's an African doesn't like him because he hates immigrants.
[00:18:44.737 --> 00:18:46.518]  Trump never said immigrants are great.
[00:18:46.518 --> 00:18:47.458]  Come here legally.
[00:18:47.458 --> 00:18:52.500]  But then it's this whole article about how hurt he is that Trump hates him.
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.462]  And again, that's the new titles in America of nobility.
[00:18:56.462 --> 00:18:57.342]  I get to be a victim.
[00:18:58.542 --> 00:19:00.083]  I get to be protected.
[00:19:00.083 --> 00:19:10.611]  I get to go around with a chip on my shoulder, disliking everyone and sovereignty because I just listen to talking points of the media and decide to be butthurt.
[00:19:10.611 --> 00:19:20.359]  And it's this whole religion where people collect like baseball cards how they've been slided and how someone got in their way and you know that's why they're not successful.
[00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:24.262]  People get in my way, I just go over them, around them, through them.
[00:19:25.694 --> 00:19:28.599]  Quite frankly, a lot of times I'll be exhausted and somebody tries to block what I'm doing.
[00:19:28.599 --> 00:19:33.727]  I just suddenly go, oh my gosh, I just got five hours of energy.
[00:19:33.727 --> 00:19:36.111]  It's called the animating contest of liberty.
[00:19:37.705 --> 00:19:39.866]  But no, no, no.
[00:19:39.866 --> 00:19:47.791]  Let's not worry about the cancer viruses, the vaccines, the GMOs, the human cloning that's already going on everywhere, all of the craziness, the toxic waste dumping.
[00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:58.337]  Let's worry about Donald Trump because the communist Chinese mass murderer grand champions who out Hitler Hitler by four to five times under one dictator, they say so.
[00:19:59.582 --> 00:20:01.363]  Hello, I'm Michael Reagan.
[00:20:01.363 --> 00:20:08.729]  My father, President Ronald Reagan, believed so strongly in gold that in 1985, he changed gold ownership forever.
[00:20:08.729 --> 00:20:14.494]  Today, our national debt is spiraling out of control, but gold coins could be the answer.

[00:20:59.588 --> 00:21:03.769]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[00:21:03.769 --> 00:21:09.951]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[00:21:09.951 --> 00:21:11.712]  How is this even possible?
[00:21:11.712 --> 00:21:19.274]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[00:21:19.274 --> 00:21:27.016]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[00:21:27.216 --> 00:21:31.579]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[00:21:31.579 --> 00:21:40.345]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[00:21:40.345 --> 00:21:41.926]  But you must act fast.
[00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:46.469]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard, our supply is extremely limited right now.
[00:21:46.749 --> 00:21:52.696]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.

[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.901]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:22:31.901 --> 00:22:37.942]  Just this past August was when we s-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-

[00:23:28.619 --> 00:23:33.900]  There's nothing more enticing and intoxicating than the finest meat cooking on an open flame.

[00:24:09.665 --> 00:24:13.785]  Trump said, I'm so happy China is upset they have waged economic war against us.
[00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:15.926]  We're going to play that clip here in a moment.
[00:24:15.926 --> 00:24:24.767]  But first off, I want everybody out there, especially listeners we've had for 15 years, to do a huge victory lap right now.
[00:24:24.767 --> 00:24:28.328]  Because if this information fully comes out, it will be
[00:24:29.665 --> 00:24:44.206]  A death blow to the New World Order corporate national security combined system that organizes terrorists, that protects terrorists, that funds and arms radical jihadists all over the world and other criminal groups.
[00:24:45.498 --> 00:24:55.384]  And allows them to then attack or protects them and opens the door for them to attack or sometimes carries out the complete attack and then the affiliate group takes the credit.
[00:24:55.384 --> 00:25:04.450]  So that the West and the rest of the world can have whatever progress we've made towards due process and human liberty and privacy dismantled.
[00:25:05.919 --> 00:25:08.442]  And now the examples are completely naked.
[00:25:08.442 --> 00:25:11.224]  They think the public's so dumb and so illogical.
[00:25:11.224 --> 00:25:12.466]  Totally out in the open.
[00:25:12.466 --> 00:25:19.293]  Europe brings in five million people in the last two years, mainly out of North Africa and Syria.
[00:25:19.293 --> 00:25:27.962]  A huge conduit of migrants, of invaders, through the Middle East is allowed into Syria, who borders Eastern Europe.
[00:25:29.128 --> 00:25:30.289]  I think so.
[00:25:48.772 --> 00:25:59.340]  And they think we're so dumb when these groups start attacking, which they've done, and when they launch their huge jihad-tet offensives that we know are coming in the future, civil emergency will be declared.
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:03.703]  We're on the anniversary of the Boston bombing.
[00:26:03.703 --> 00:26:06.085]  The media claims that I say there was no bombing at all.
[00:26:06.085 --> 00:26:09.108]  I do not say that.
[00:26:09.108 --> 00:26:15.332]  Or they say that I claim mercenaries did it because people were wearing Kraft International-style uniforms and Punisher hats.
[00:26:15.332 --> 00:26:17.234]  I'm not saying Kraft International did that.
[00:26:20.177 --> 00:26:22.919]  I'm saying they were clearly there running some type of security.
[00:26:22.919 --> 00:26:26.160]  They knew something was coming and there was a drill going on that day.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:32.164]  Perfect cover for someone else to bomb it.
[00:26:32.164 --> 00:26:34.905]  And then it turned out the two brothers had CIA connections.
[00:26:34.905 --> 00:26:40.649]  The older one paid by the State Department through Georgetown University to travel undercover under a fake name.
[00:26:42.861 --> 00:26:47.384]  To areas of southern Russia and into the stands like Chechnya.
[00:26:47.384 --> 00:26:51.767]  And Russia, two years before the Boston bombing, blew his cover.
[00:26:51.767 --> 00:26:56.630]  He was a boxer, playboy, cool guy.
[00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:57.550]  He got set up.
[00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:00.572]  We don't know exactly what happened.
[00:27:00.572 --> 00:27:03.534]  But that terror attack had false flag written all over it.
[00:27:03.534 --> 00:27:06.576]  But regardless, they're letting these people in en masse.
[00:27:06.576 --> 00:27:12.240]  San Bernardino, the Major Hassan shooting Fort Hood, all of it, they keep trying to call it
[00:27:13.442 --> 00:27:14.783]  Workplace violence.
[00:27:14.783 --> 00:27:19.587]  We're exposing that it's terror, but pointing out who opened the door.
[00:27:19.587 --> 00:27:21.068]  How does the mainstream media respond?
[00:27:21.068 --> 00:27:25.112]  They lie about what we've said.
[00:27:25.112 --> 00:27:31.778]  Just like I've been saying two months before 9-11, 15 years ago, and from the day it happened,
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.821]  That NORAD stood down.
[00:27:33.821 --> 00:27:35.563]  They had drills that day.
[00:27:35.563 --> 00:27:38.125]  They ordered 15 of the 19 hijackers to be let in.
[00:27:38.125 --> 00:27:48.034]  I had the head of the embassy on Monday September 9-11, Mr. Springman, who said they were told they were CIA and to let the hijackers in.
[00:27:48.034 --> 00:27:49.556]  And then the FBI tried to bust them.
[00:27:49.556 --> 00:27:50.837]  They were ordered to stand down.
[00:27:50.837 --> 00:27:52.238]  And there's more to the story than that.
[00:27:52.238 --> 00:27:54.801]  But we have NORAD ordered to stand down.
[00:27:54.801 --> 00:27:57.623]  We have the FAA ordered to stand down.
[00:27:57.623 --> 00:27:58.184]  We have
[00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:00.730]  The evidence.
[00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:01.730]  We know it happened.
[00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:11.093]  And the Congressional Commission, the 28 pages, says there was a stand-down order and an order afterwards to cover up the Saudi connection.
[00:28:11.093 --> 00:28:13.353]  We already know the FBI was ordered to do that.
[00:28:13.353 --> 00:28:15.334]  It was in the news at the time!
[00:28:15.334 --> 00:28:19.275]  I would hold up mainstream news when this stuff came out.
[00:28:19.275 --> 00:28:23.656]  And the media would say, oh, Alex isn't covering C-SPAN or the Associated Press.
[00:28:23.656 --> 00:28:25.056]  Alex is making it up.
[00:28:27.264 --> 00:28:30.685]  Just like they misrepresent what Donald Trump says.
[00:28:30.685 --> 00:28:37.387]  And now Donald Trump comes out a few months ago and says the Saudis were involved in 9-11 and I'm going to expose the 28 pages.
[00:28:37.387 --> 00:28:45.929]  And all of you pushing over these years and Congressman Walter Jones has come on probably 20 times the last four or five years trying to get his bill passed to release this.
[00:28:45.929 --> 00:28:49.450]  He's now inches away from it coming out unredacted.
[00:28:50.523 --> 00:28:52.765]  People say, well, there's going to be more to it than that.
[00:28:52.765 --> 00:28:56.408]  Yes, but this is like getting Al Capone on income tax evasion.
[00:28:56.408 --> 00:28:59.291]  Then you get him for everything else.
[00:28:59.291 --> 00:29:04.336]  A member of the mainstream media, Donald Trump, suggested Saudi Arabia was behind 9-11 multiple times Wednesday.
[00:29:04.336 --> 00:29:06.878]  That was two months ago.
[00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:08.379]  Let's go back to the date there.
[00:29:08.379 --> 00:29:09.721]  Scroll back up for me, please.
[00:29:09.721 --> 00:29:11.362]  Radio listeners, you can go see this.
[00:29:11.362 --> 00:29:14.525]  That's in the New York Daily News, February 17th.
[00:29:18.015 --> 00:29:19.696]  Oh, how dare him!
[00:29:19.696 --> 00:29:21.456]  Oh, Donald Trump was right again!
[00:29:21.456 --> 00:29:25.098]  And look for Donald Trump to come out and say, see, I was right.
[00:29:25.098 --> 00:29:28.019]  See, I told you.
[00:29:28.019 --> 00:29:46.305]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[00:29:48.962 --> 00:29:52.863]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.863 --> 00:29:59.604]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.604 --> 00:30:02.345]  Today is Monday, April 18th, and here's some of the latest news.
[00:30:02.345 --> 00:30:06.786]  It's now known that the Colorado lawmakers who voted to scrap the state primary are in fact Ted Cruz delegates.
[00:30:06.786 --> 00:30:11.747]  Four state Republicans voted against a bill that would allow Colorado voters a chance to vote in a presidential primary.
[00:30:11.747 --> 00:30:16.168]  And all of them are Cruz supporters, with three of them listed as members of Cruz's Colorado leadership team.
[00:30:16.548 --> 00:30:24.111]  And one of them, Senator Kevin Grantham, even had the audacity to brag about Cruz's quote victory on Twitter despite the fact that the voters did not get to pick a candidate.
[00:30:24.111 --> 00:30:31.775]  In other news, only 6% of people trust the mainstream media, putting the industry about equal to Congress and well below the public's view of other organizations.
[00:30:31.775 --> 00:30:36.597]  This lack of confidence in establishment media is fueled by inaccuracies in reporting and deceptive bias.
[00:30:36.917 --> 00:30:46.260]  Another study revealed that only 45% of Americans, over 77 million, will not pay an income tax this year because they have no taxable income or they received enough tax breaks to raise their liability.
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.880]  This says a lot about the current decline of the economy.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:54.702]  You'd expect less tax revenue as more Americans leave the job market or stay underemployed at part-time jobs.

[00:32:00.273 --> 00:32:00.854]  Good, brother.
[00:32:00.854 --> 00:32:02.796]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:32:02.796 --> 00:32:04.518]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:32:04.518 --> 00:32:08.542]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:32:08.542 --> 00:32:11.165]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:32:11.165 --> 00:32:13.587]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:32:13.587 --> 00:32:21.436]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.

[00:32:26.522 --> 00:32:29.425]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:32:29.425 --> 00:32:31.227]  Saved me a ton of money there.
[00:32:31.227 --> 00:32:36.493]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[00:32:36.493 --> 00:32:39.115]  Concentrated or maximum potency.
[00:32:39.115 --> 00:32:51.065]  I want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience where a stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[00:33:00.987 --> 00:33:07.208]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:33:07.208 --> 00:33:15.510]  Homeland security begins with hometown security.
[00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:25.471]  It seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets, which may make scarring particularly difficult, even with this year's rule changes.
[00:33:25.471 --> 00:33:28.912]  To recap those revisions, women
[00:33:30.211 --> 00:33:34.513]  ...are still worth 10 points more than men in all age brackets.
[00:33:34.513 --> 00:33:43.276]  But teenagers now rack up 40 points, and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70 points.
[00:33:43.276 --> 00:33:53.220]  The big score, anyone, any sex, over 75 years old, has been upped to 100 points.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:58.883]  As always, how fast you move determines how long you live.
[00:34:03.354 --> 00:34:07.438]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:34:07.438 --> 00:34:13.605]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:13.605 --> 00:34:16.428]  That intro's about four years old.
[00:34:16.428 --> 00:34:17.469]  John Balboa together.
[00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:25.136]  Remember when Homeland Security ordered three million life-size targets of little children and women in the shower and old people?
[00:34:26.315 --> 00:34:37.841]  So we simply took those news articles, well we broke the news about it, showed the articles, if you're a radio listener, I'm describing what people just saw, and then cut it together with Death Race 2000.
[00:34:37.841 --> 00:34:46.106]  The David Carradine, Sylvester Stallone and others, man that's a really good movie.
[00:34:46.106 --> 00:34:51.849]  Breaking down the future dystopia we would live in under a depopulation agenda.
[00:34:51.849 --> 00:34:55.531]  And as usual, the faster you are, the longer you live.
[00:34:59.013 --> 00:35:03.074]  Again, not bragging, I want to give everybody hope.
[00:35:03.074 --> 00:35:06.115]  Because there is a lot of hope there.
[00:35:06.115 --> 00:35:19.740]  The talking points we put out sometimes take 15 years to bear fruit, but we can directly follow the line of this audience at the very heart of 9-11 Truth.
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:26.862]  The demonization we went under, the misrepresentation we went under, the attacks we went under, the monetary attack we went under.
[00:35:29.164 --> 00:35:37.532]  I had over 120 affiliates at the time and the program director came to Ted and said, we're losing all of our affiliates.
[00:35:37.532 --> 00:35:39.454]  Alex's show is exploding.
[00:35:39.454 --> 00:35:42.057]  I was like 27 years old.
[00:35:42.057 --> 00:35:49.704]  He keeps saying it's an inside job and I can't get him to stop doing it and the stations are turning him off.
[00:35:49.704 --> 00:35:51.927]  And Ted Anderson called me and he said, I'll tell you what, Alex.
[00:35:53.732 --> 00:36:00.196]  When I first hired you, you were only on a couple stations, and so you're losing most your stages, but if you want to do that, go ahead.
[00:36:00.196 --> 00:36:03.438]  And I did.
[00:36:03.438 --> 00:36:14.865]  Because I knew that there were criminal elements in our government working with Saudi Arabia and jihadists, just like they do in Syria, just like they do in Libya today, and in Europe, Merkel and Hollande.
[00:36:14.865 --> 00:36:17.006]  And I knew I had to morally tell the truth.
[00:36:17.006 --> 00:36:19.228]  It didn't matter.
[00:36:19.228 --> 00:36:20.869]  And people were amazed by that.
[00:36:22.782 --> 00:36:28.886]  That my show, just out of nowhere, was one of the fastest growing in radio history.
[00:36:28.886 --> 00:36:32.908]  27 years old.
[00:36:32.908 --> 00:36:34.249]  26 years old.
[00:36:34.249 --> 00:36:34.929]  It was 15 years ago.
[00:36:34.929 --> 00:36:38.552]  I'm 42 today.
[00:36:38.552 --> 00:36:42.334]  I'd already been on air like four years, five years.
[00:36:42.334 --> 00:36:48.638]  Already paid my dues, and it was exploding, and it was not hard to say no and do the right thing.
[00:36:48.638 --> 00:36:49.098]  I mean, I
[00:36:51.994 --> 00:36:59.915]  I saw them that day on television and I heard them on CBS radio say, we're going to demolition building 7, the Solomon Brothers building.
[00:37:01.792 --> 00:37:07.074]  And then I went on air and said they said they were going to blow it up, and then people said that I was lying.
[00:37:07.074 --> 00:37:20.000]  It took years for the Internet Archive to get good enough to where CNN and ABC and NBC and BBC started uploading their full coverage of 9-11 to the Internet, and it was all on tape, on newscasts that were newscasts.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.321]  All right, we're going to blow it up.
[00:37:21.321 --> 00:37:22.541]  We've got the explosives inside.
[00:37:22.541 --> 00:37:24.282]  We're going to bring it down.
[00:37:24.282 --> 00:37:28.184]  And then I interviewed the emergency manager, the deputy emergency manager, and he said, no, there were bombs.
[00:37:28.184 --> 00:37:28.964]  They told us get out.
[00:37:30.506 --> 00:37:31.949]  And then they killed him two weeks later.
[00:37:31.949 --> 00:37:41.867]  I mean, am I just supposed to shut up about that?
[00:37:41.867 --> 00:37:43.109]  And then a lot of folks out there...
[00:37:44.608 --> 00:37:46.689]  Say, Jones, why don't you cover 9-11 Truth more?
[00:37:46.689 --> 00:37:55.493]  It's like one of these little moral scoreboard things that, you know, anybody out there can make themselves better than the evil Alex Jones and say, Jones isn't the father of 9-11 Truth.
[00:37:55.493 --> 00:37:57.614]  Jones isn't the progenitor of it all.
[00:37:57.614 --> 00:38:01.355]  Jones isn't the guy that questioned it before, on the day, and after.
[00:38:01.355 --> 00:38:09.939]  And that hammered it and made, you know, a whole bunch of films about it and wrote a book about it and had all these guests on and put on huge 9-11 events in LA with thousands of people for the first time on C-SPAN.
[00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:12.471]  No, no, no.
[00:38:12.471 --> 00:38:17.657]  He's the one covering it up!
[00:38:17.657 --> 00:38:28.428]  Because he doesn't cover it every day or let somebody call him up and bully him saying, have me on, space beams did it, if you don't agree with me, you're with the government, you know, all this mental illness.
[00:38:28.428 --> 00:38:31.372]  I haven't spent most of my time on 9-11 in five or six years.
[00:38:33.092 --> 00:38:37.215]  Because worldwide it's already well known.
[00:38:37.215 --> 00:38:39.057]  The 28 pages are being exposed.
[00:38:39.057 --> 00:38:42.059]  I knew there was a movement that would end up bringing it all out.
[00:38:42.059 --> 00:38:53.409]  I'd already, in my bombing run, imagine like I'm a high-tech or this operation's a high-tech B3 bomber, going Mach 5, loaded with bombs, and I've got a bunch of cities to hit, a bunch of lives to blow.
[00:38:55.054 --> 00:38:59.197]  And I'm going to target, drop, make sure I hit target, accelerate on to the next target.
[00:38:59.197 --> 00:39:06.962]  And while folks are back there looking at the wreckage of the enemy operation, I'm going to be 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 targets up, blasting.
[00:39:09.182 --> 00:39:13.427]  And doing maneuvers, and the SAM missiles, you know, barely hitting us.
[00:39:13.427 --> 00:39:21.616]  I mean, seriously, I'm talking infiltrators, you're gonna get in the real world, black ops, dirty tricks, but incredible providence, folks.
[00:39:21.616 --> 00:39:22.657]  Incredible providence.
[00:39:22.657 --> 00:39:26.521]  But my life, behind the scenes, is like a James Bond movie.
[00:39:26.521 --> 00:39:27.422]  Many times.
[00:39:27.422 --> 00:39:29.925]  Might be totally still for six months, and then all hell breaks loose.
[00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:34.911]  And I've just never seen such providence as it all blows up in the enemy's face.
[00:39:34.911 --> 00:39:36.751]  It's amazing.
[00:39:36.751 --> 00:39:38.412]  But just know this.
[00:39:38.412 --> 00:39:41.932]  You deserve the credit as the listeners, the viewers, the activists.
[00:39:41.932 --> 00:39:43.193]  And I know you don't want credit.
[00:39:43.193 --> 00:39:44.673]  You want justice and liberty and freedom.
[00:39:44.673 --> 00:39:45.993]  But just understand.
[00:39:45.993 --> 00:39:48.574]  You got ridiculed for talking about 9-11 truth.
[00:39:48.574 --> 00:39:52.655]  You got demonized when Fox News was saying anybody that talked about it should be arrested.
[00:39:52.655 --> 00:39:55.856]  You went through hell and you deserve just as much credit as we do.
[00:39:56.596 --> 00:40:17.627]  But at the same time, I've always been so focused on the next mission that I never get up here and celebrate the victories we've had, and the amazing successes we've had together as a Liberty Movement, and all of you out there as activists, and radio hosts, and filmmakers, and authors, and researchers, everything you've gone through, I salute you.
[00:40:17.627 --> 00:40:21.329]  From Alex Jones to you, you're my hero.
[00:40:21.329 --> 00:40:23.630]  That's why I don't want you calling up telling me how great I am.
[00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:24.330]  I've done my duty.
[00:40:27.731 --> 00:40:30.353]  It is very humbling to have such good people look up to me.
[00:40:30.353 --> 00:40:37.239]  Listen, I look up to you, and we're all in this together, brothers and sisters, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, you name it.
[00:40:37.239 --> 00:40:44.925]  We love truth, and we're standing up for justice, and history has proven, as Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:40:44.925 --> 00:40:49.269]  said, the universe bends towards justice.
[00:40:49.269 --> 00:40:50.050]  There is providence.
[00:40:51.428 --> 00:40:56.989]  And what people don't understand is the secret isn't stuff taught on Oprah Winfrey, where you just magically believe something and it happens.
[00:40:56.989 --> 00:41:06.891]  You've got to have the infrastructure, the people, justice on your side, and the will, and the perseverance, and then, then you can do almost anything.
[00:41:06.891 --> 00:41:08.832]  It's true.
[00:41:08.832 --> 00:41:12.192]  Look, humans envision things and then a few decades later they're reality.
[00:41:12.192 --> 00:41:15.093]  We are incredible creatures, made in the image of the Creator.
[00:41:16.581 --> 00:41:27.707]  But you don't fully activate as a soul and as an intellect and as a mind and as a people until you're put through the fire and until you have stood up against evil.
[00:41:27.707 --> 00:41:39.313]  And every level I go up fighting evil, just more opens up and it's like the knowledge intensifies to the point of just, it's just too much.
[00:41:39.313 --> 00:41:43.336]  It's like that Moby song, we gotta go out with it, we've got it as outro music.
[00:41:45.925 --> 00:41:46.886]  I forget the name of the song.
[00:41:46.886 --> 00:41:49.968]  It's like, I would stand in line for this.
[00:41:49.968 --> 00:41:52.130]  Yeah.
[00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:54.611]  There's always time in life for this.
[00:41:54.611 --> 00:41:56.633]  Extreme ways, yeah.
[00:41:56.633 --> 00:42:00.075]  There's a line in the song about, you know, I had to shut my mind down.
[00:42:00.075 --> 00:42:03.878]  I couldn't handle it.
[00:42:03.878 --> 00:42:05.459]  Too much and I couldn't think.
[00:42:05.459 --> 00:42:07.040]  Too little and I was basically a zombie.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.042]  I forget the exact words to it.
[00:42:09.042 --> 00:42:10.003]  And that's what it comes down to.
[00:42:11.618 --> 00:42:14.920]  We're changing the world right now because we have the narrative.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.382]  We actually know what's going on.
[00:42:17.382 --> 00:42:19.324]  We know how the enemy operates.
[00:42:19.324 --> 00:42:21.625]  We understand their criminology.
[00:42:21.625 --> 00:42:23.206]  We understand what their goals are.
[00:42:23.206 --> 00:42:25.468]  We understand what their next moves are going to be.
[00:42:25.468 --> 00:42:34.915]  And we've now reached a point where the enemy is still operating out in the open, thinking that we're not going to resist them or say no to their operations.
[00:42:34.915 --> 00:42:37.937]  So if I impart anything to you, it's this, because you sure teach me a lot.
[00:42:39.338 --> 00:42:42.099]  It's that you have incredible power.
[00:42:42.099 --> 00:42:44.560]  You are the engine of human liberty worldwide.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:49.041]  And let me tell you, the listeners of this broadcast, you are the front line.
[00:42:49.041 --> 00:42:50.602]  You are the tip of the spear.
[00:42:50.602 --> 00:42:52.423]  You are the eyes and ears of humanity.
[00:42:52.423 --> 00:42:59.065]  You're the people for your background, your genetics, your religious experiences, your spiritual experiences.
[00:42:59.065 --> 00:43:01.926]  For whatever reason, you're the people in this time and place.
[00:43:03.154 --> 00:43:11.016]  The biggest assemblage of awakened people to the technocratic, globalist, anti-human takeover.
[00:43:11.016 --> 00:43:12.937]  That's why I say look in the mirror.
[00:43:12.937 --> 00:43:13.757]  It's not a tagline.
[00:43:13.757 --> 00:43:14.517]  It's not a logo.
[00:43:14.517 --> 00:43:16.058]  It's not a cool saying.
[00:43:16.058 --> 00:43:19.319]  It's the truth.
[00:43:19.319 --> 00:43:22.860]  Look in the mirror because you are the resistance.
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:24.000]  And the answer to their 1984 society is 1776.
[00:43:31.308 --> 00:43:39.873]  That's why the enemy's done everything they can to dumb us down and poison us and physically poison us with chemicals and biologicals but also culturally poison us.
[00:43:39.873 --> 00:43:43.696]  Lord knows I've been poisoned, good Lord.
[00:43:43.696 --> 00:43:50.980]  But I still have my soul and my heart focused on God and I know the way out of this and I'm stumbling through this fight, but I'm telling you.
[00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:58.845]  Somebody who loves God and loves the truth, stumbling on their knees is a giant compared to these evil people.
[00:43:58.845 --> 00:44:00.446]  Greedy, self-serving and hateful.
[00:44:02.813 --> 00:44:06.516]  They have no empathy, they have no love of humanity.
[00:44:06.516 --> 00:44:15.904]  And they know we do, so they tailor their propaganda around love and the fraternity of humans together, and all they're doing is trying to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:44:15.904 --> 00:44:20.227]  These people are devils.
[00:44:20.227 --> 00:44:24.351]  And I mean literal devils.
[00:44:24.351 --> 00:44:26.873]  Because they've manifested themselves as devilish creatures.
[00:44:30.009 --> 00:44:38.055]  I saw the White House run Right Wing Watch, and the White House run Media Matters this weekend in my Google Alerts, saying, Jones now thinks it's the end times.
[00:44:38.055 --> 00:44:42.038]  Ha, ha, ha, and laughed at me.
[00:44:42.038 --> 00:44:43.299]  And then, you know, they've got other alerts.
[00:44:43.299 --> 00:44:44.160]  Trump's a kook.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.061]  He says Saudi Arabia was involved in 9-11.
[00:44:46.061 --> 00:44:48.343]  You know, they'll say something such as a kook.
[00:44:48.343 --> 00:44:56.169]  They say the sun's yellow at high noon and a clear sky.
[00:44:56.169 --> 00:44:59.251]  So they take the most obvious stuff, and then they make a big joke out of it.
[00:45:01.277 --> 00:45:04.018]  Like they're the high authority reporting on us.
[00:45:04.018 --> 00:45:11.002]  And my whole rant was about even if you don't believe in God, the genetic engineering, the chimeras, the...
[00:45:12.597 --> 00:45:21.864]  Manipulation of the environment, the geoengineering, the world government, phasing out of cash, the elite saying they're going to merge with machines and become gods.
[00:45:21.864 --> 00:45:25.847]  It was all about the fact that, boy, that sounds like the end times to me.
[00:45:25.847 --> 00:45:34.874]  And if they've got enough nuclear weapons to destroy the world dozens of times over, and we end up having a nuclear war, which the Pentagon says we're in more danger of now than during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:45:35.816 --> 00:45:42.060]  We could make our own Armageddon, whether the Bible's true or not, we need to have some restraint and not do this.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.761]  And then I saw the restraint.
[00:45:44.761 --> 00:45:54.607]  How creepy is it that those organizations are admittedly run by the White House and get their talking points from them, and the White House is worried about making fun of me, saying we need to not blow the earth up?
[00:45:59.275 --> 00:46:00.276]  That's what I mean.
[00:46:00.276 --> 00:46:08.624]  They all have this giggling, demonic attitude like everything's funny and nothing's serious.
[00:46:08.624 --> 00:46:22.036]  But when they get diagnosed with cancer at 35 or 40 years old, the slacker outfit, the trendy outfit, and the trendy nomenclature isn't gonna get you out of it.
[00:46:22.036 --> 00:46:24.799]  And if we have a nuclear war, that's not gonna, you know, being trendy,
[00:46:26.983 --> 00:46:30.966]  And using the proper language systems in your cult isn't going to protect you.
[00:46:30.966 --> 00:46:34.489]  And I'm reaching out to you as fellow humans and saying, what is your problem?
[00:46:34.489 --> 00:46:36.150]  And I realize the problem.
[00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:40.234]  They can always find somebody to take that position and take that place.
[00:46:40.234 --> 00:46:48.020]  They can always find sociopaths and evil people that are willing to prey on their fellow humans.
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:49.341]  But it is a giant victory.
[00:46:49.341 --> 00:46:53.845]  It's a devastating victory.
[00:46:53.845 --> 00:46:55.726]  That they have New York Daily News headlines.
[00:46:56.792 --> 00:46:57.432]  How the U.S.
[00:46:57.432 --> 00:46:59.553]  government covered up Saudi role in 9-11.
[00:46:59.553 --> 00:47:00.533]  That's a headline.
[00:47:00.533 --> 00:47:03.815]  Secret 28 pages of 9-11 report under new scrutiny.
[00:47:03.815 --> 00:47:06.316]  Saudi Arabia threatens to pull $750 billion from U.S.
[00:47:06.316 --> 00:47:09.957]  economy if Congress allows them to be sued for 9-11 terror attacks.
[00:47:09.957 --> 00:47:10.437]  How the U.S.
[00:47:10.437 --> 00:47:12.338]  covered up Saudi role in 9-11.
[00:47:12.338 --> 00:47:16.119]  New York Post.
[00:47:16.119 --> 00:47:20.661]  Saudi Arabia warns of economic fallout if Congress passes 9-11 bill.
[00:47:20.661 --> 00:47:22.382]  That just releases that congressional report.
[00:47:23.652 --> 00:47:29.196]  That's Saudi Arabia holding us hostage again, threatening economic Armageddon.
[00:47:29.196 --> 00:47:36.600]  Look at how much control we're already under with the Saudis, see?
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:39.262]  See how far down they've taken us and the Communist Chinese?
[00:47:39.262 --> 00:47:40.803]  They all say we can't have Trump.
[00:47:40.803 --> 00:47:44.405]  They're all so mad at Trump because he dare talk about 9-11 truth, you see.
[00:47:44.405 --> 00:47:51.650]  I'm going to go to break and come back and play Trump, talking about the Communist Chinese and how they're in economic war with us.
[00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:51.890]  Yes.
[00:47:53.772 --> 00:48:02.996]  And then we're the elites here that make deals with them to pass rules and laws, making it impossible for us to compete.
[00:48:02.996 --> 00:48:11.019]  Remember that guy named Pacharia over in India who was running the UN carbon program?
[00:48:11.019 --> 00:48:19.622]  And it turned out his son owned the new multi-hundred million dollar coal-fired plant that was also going to have a steel mill operating off of it.
[00:48:20.475 --> 00:48:28.118]  And they even made a carbon deal with the last steel mill and the last coal plant in Sheffield, England.
[00:48:28.118 --> 00:48:30.339]  Sheffield Steel.
[00:48:30.339 --> 00:48:32.240]  Moved to India.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:36.482]  And then it came out he was getting the money for it, and so he had to step down.
[00:48:36.482 --> 00:48:44.225]  This is literally trading and selling out, and the politicians get five, ten million dollars, and you get a hundred million, billion dollar plant in your country.
[00:48:45.196 --> 00:48:46.876]  They're selling us out so cheap.
[00:48:46.876 --> 00:48:49.657]  They're not making bad deals like Trump says.
[00:48:49.657 --> 00:48:53.278]  They're making deals to sink this country because they're globalist and they want to bring us down.
[00:48:53.278 --> 00:48:57.199]  Speaking of economic warfare, shop local.
[00:48:57.199 --> 00:48:58.900]  Shop USA as much as you can.
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:48:59.600]  Nobody's perfect.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.860]  Hardly anything's made here.
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:02.240]  Support local communities.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.381]  Go to the farmer's market.
[00:49:03.381 --> 00:49:04.841]  Plant a garden.
[00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:09.122]  That's how we bring America back is learning basic self-sufficiency activities.
[00:49:09.122 --> 00:49:11.523]  They don't want us to be able to take care of ourselves.
[00:49:13.407 --> 00:49:15.147]  We have a special that ends tonight.
[00:49:15.147 --> 00:49:17.208]  It's 25% off.
[00:49:17.208 --> 00:49:20.208]  Brain Force, the ultimate nootropic out there for the price.
[00:49:20.208 --> 00:49:22.009]  Probably got something better than 300 bucks.
[00:49:22.009 --> 00:49:23.949]  It's $22 right now.
[00:49:23.949 --> 00:49:26.630]  It's 45% off retail, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:28.450]  25% off its regular discount.
[00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:29.070]  It's amazing.
[00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:36.612]  L-CNN, Alpha GPC, and a whole bunch of other organic-based, a lot of synthetic stuff out there, folks, that isn't uploaded by your brain.
[00:49:36.612 --> 00:49:37.492]  This has stuff in it.
[00:49:37.492 --> 00:49:38.492]  There's prescription in Europe.
[00:49:40.708 --> 00:49:54.322]  We also have DNA Force back in stock with the patented CoQ10, BioPQQ, digestive enzymes, immune boosting, astragalus root, pomegranate extract, plant-based resveratrol, and a lot more.
[00:49:54.322 --> 00:49:57.526]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:49:57.526 --> 00:50:00.829]  Infowarslife.com is where you go right to the nutraceuticals.
[00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:02.151]  You need to understand that.
[00:50:03.732 --> 00:50:06.613]  Your purchase also funds this operation, so you cannot lose.
[00:50:06.613 --> 00:50:23.621]  You're getting the very best possible nutraceuticals that we can develop and come up with, and you're supporting an organization that is changing the narrative and affecting the globalists deeply, and with truth, sabotaging them at every level.
[00:50:23.621 --> 00:50:31.264]  And doing things that down the road, you see, just like Force 10 from Navarone, I've explained that allegory where they bombed the dam.
[00:50:33.311 --> 00:50:39.936]  And it's the sequel of Force 10 Navarone, and it doesn't collapse right away, and they're getting up, and just give it a minute.
[00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:41.858]  And that's what I keep explaining to everybody.
[00:50:41.858 --> 00:50:46.542]  We're doing things that have already destroyed the globalists.
[00:50:46.542 --> 00:50:58.932]  Now, there may be some new group that rises up, that's why they want to keep building the system, but believe me, we've devastated the national security combine run by foreign institutions, we've devastated the New World Order, the globalist Pan-Arab alliance, all of it's coming down.
[00:51:00.026 --> 00:51:02.348]  Are you concerned about the Power Grid?
[00:51:02.348 --> 00:51:04.771]  About the new war on the Power Grid?
[00:51:04.771 --> 00:51:10.336]  If so, this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear, and the most valuable.
[00:51:10.336 --> 00:51:11.317]  Here's why.
[00:51:11.317 --> 00:51:16.883]  An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the Power Grid has just been written.
[00:51:16.883 --> 00:51:20.747]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies.
[00:51:21.027 --> 00:51:24.289]  But only for a limited time to GCN listeners.
[00:51:24.289 --> 00:51:28.992]  He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[00:51:28.992 --> 00:51:34.775]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book to you.
[00:51:34.775 --> 00:51:35.716]  Why do this?
[00:51:35.716 --> 00:51:39.598]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[00:51:39.598 --> 00:51:40.879]  The answer is simple.
[00:51:40.879 --> 00:51:45.041]  America's power grid is in grave danger and most Americans are clueless.

[00:52:30.635 --> 00:52:33.177]  Think body armor is just for commandos?
[00:52:33.177 --> 00:52:34.158]  Think again.
[00:52:34.158 --> 00:52:37.760]  In a collapse situation, you need to protect your entire family.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:43.764]  Infidel Body Armor has created lightweight armor that repels AR-15 and AK-47 rounds.

[00:52:59.119 --> 00:53:03.345]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:53:03.345 --> 00:53:03.966]  It's true.
[00:53:03.966 --> 00:53:08.112]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:53:08.112 --> 00:53:10.515]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:53:10.515 --> 00:53:14.982]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[00:53:48.297 --> 00:53:49.617]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[00:53:49.617 --> 00:53:50.698]  For the love of clean water.
[00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:16.590]  We're starting a new meme.
[00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:19.271]  It's up at RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[00:54:19.271 --> 00:54:23.172]  We're going to post an article to InfoWars.com and welcome you to send your memes in.
[00:54:23.172 --> 00:54:24.052]  We'll post them as well.
[00:54:24.052 --> 00:54:25.532]  At least the good ones.
[00:54:25.532 --> 00:54:29.093]  But everybody wins engaging in the InfoWar.
[00:54:29.093 --> 00:54:31.453]  And so for radio listeners, I'll go ahead and read the meme out.
[00:54:31.453 --> 00:54:33.794]  TV viewers already saw it, obviously.
[00:54:33.794 --> 00:54:36.014]  We'll put that back on screen.
[00:54:36.014 --> 00:54:37.274]  Kit Daniels came up with the idea.
[00:54:37.274 --> 00:54:39.795]  The truth about Ted Cruz in one image.
[00:54:40.814 --> 00:54:43.415]  And it's at Real Donald Trump and at Drudge.
[00:54:43.415 --> 00:54:44.735]  We just tweeted it there.
[00:54:44.735 --> 00:54:49.656]  It's up on Real Alex Jones right now and at Kit Daniels 1776.
[00:54:49.656 --> 00:54:56.578]  These men all agree voterless elections work.
[00:54:56.578 --> 00:54:56.998]  That's right.
[00:54:56.998 --> 00:54:58.198]  These men all agree.
[00:54:58.198 --> 00:55:04.120]  Mao Zedong, Saddam Hussein, Joseph Stalin.
[00:55:05.805 --> 00:55:09.007]  And quite frankly, I really don't think Saddam Hussein even deserves to be up there.
[00:55:09.007 --> 00:55:20.274]  I'm not saying he was a good guy, but he was shut up by the CIA, and stabilized the whole area, and took out all the radical jihadis, and let women go to college, and listen to rock and roll on the radio, and they really set him up.
[00:55:20.274 --> 00:55:21.394]  Let's just say this, he's evil.
[00:55:21.394 --> 00:55:23.436]  Compare people that set him up in our government, he's an angel.
[00:55:24.155 --> 00:55:25.356]  The media will say I said he's an angel.
[00:55:25.356 --> 00:55:26.557]  No, I said he's evil.
[00:55:26.557 --> 00:55:28.079]  But compared to them, he's an angel.
[00:55:28.079 --> 00:55:29.680]  So let's put that meme back up there, folks.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:31.402]  The power of you, the people.
[00:55:31.402 --> 00:55:32.103]  Let's go with this.
[00:55:32.103 --> 00:55:32.984]  These men all agree.
[00:55:32.984 --> 00:55:34.345]  Voterless elections work.
[00:55:34.345 --> 00:55:37.608]  And just all the different dictators, all the different tyrants, all the different folks.
[00:55:37.608 --> 00:55:44.815]  You can put LBJ up there, who famously stole his way into the Texas delegation for Congress.
[00:55:44.815 --> 00:55:45.776]  We just tweeted that out.
[00:55:45.776 --> 00:55:47.138]  Let's see that go mega viral.
[00:55:49.406 --> 00:55:52.508]  Also, if you want to stay in contact with us, the censorship intensifies.
[00:55:52.508 --> 00:55:56.711]  You want to get exclusive videos, exclusive audio, exclusive articles.

[00:56:02.716 --> 00:56:05.538]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:56:05.538 --> 00:56:06.598]  Just put in your email.
[00:56:06.598 --> 00:56:09.521]  We'll be able to stay in contact with you.
[00:56:09.521 --> 00:56:11.182]  So, even the Daily Mail gets it.
[00:56:12.728 --> 00:56:22.691]  Cruz claims he's won landslides over and over, beating Trump in five consecutive states, even though only one of them held an election.
[00:56:22.691 --> 00:56:23.511]  That's right.
[00:56:23.511 --> 00:56:31.214]  See, the Daily Mail and others are now picking up on the fact that he's calling it landslide and democracy and voter revolt and grassroots uprising.
[00:56:31.214 --> 00:56:32.474]  These are quotes.
[00:56:32.474 --> 00:56:41.417]  It's not grassroots uprising when they cancel an election and then have party delegates selected by the upper party members vote, and then you act like voters voted.
[00:56:42.469 --> 00:56:46.410]  And he goes on Glenn Beck and goes, he's just mad I won all the votes.
[00:56:46.410 --> 00:56:53.133]  You're not telling him it's superdelegates, Cruz.
[00:56:53.133 --> 00:56:58.914]  The reason he's going to have a landslide in New York, not just his home state, but because he gets to have a popular vote there.
[00:56:58.914 --> 00:57:02.075]  But in other states where he won, they're taking the delegates afterwards.
[00:57:02.075 --> 00:57:05.857]  Let's go out to break though with Trump saying, I'm so happy China's upset.
[00:57:05.857 --> 00:57:07.977]  They have waged economic war against us.
[00:57:07.977 --> 00:57:09.198]  Yes, it's war.
[00:57:09.198 --> 00:57:09.518]  Here it is.
[00:57:10.797 --> 00:57:16.604]  Today, on the top of Drudge, Matt Drudge is a phenomenal person, a phenomenal guy.
[00:57:16.604 --> 00:57:18.527]  It's a big deal, top of Drudge.
[00:57:18.527 --> 00:57:21.911]  China is upset with Donald Trump.
[00:57:21.911 --> 00:57:23.333]  How dare them!
[00:57:23.333 --> 00:57:25.075]  So they go, they're upset.
[00:57:25.075 --> 00:57:28.179]  Now here's the story, the biggest story, top of Drudge, big story.
[00:57:28.991 --> 00:57:34.056]  China's upset because of the way Donald Trump is talking about trade with China.
[00:57:34.056 --> 00:57:35.378]  They're ripping us off, folks.
[00:57:35.378 --> 00:57:36.158]  It's time.
[00:57:36.158 --> 00:57:37.720]  I'm so happy they're upset.
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:40.603]  They haven't been upset with us in 30 years.
[00:57:40.603 --> 00:57:41.524]  They're never upset.
[00:57:47.024 --> 00:57:47.465]  It's so racist.
[00:58:16.544 --> 00:58:16.751]  We're good.
[00:58:17.938 --> 00:58:21.240]  We'll get things going fast, and you have to look at my answer.
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:22.441]  My response- Alright, we're gonna go to break.
[00:58:22.441 --> 00:58:23.502]  We'll go ahead and fade this down.
[00:58:23.502 --> 00:58:24.642]  That's why they hate him.
[00:58:24.642 --> 00:58:25.783]  He's a nationalist.
[00:58:25.783 --> 00:58:30.766]  They have a 35-40% tariff on their currency on us, where we can't compete.
[00:58:30.766 --> 00:58:31.767]  It's a total screwjob.
[00:58:31.767 --> 00:58:33.448]  It's why we've been de-industrialized.
[00:58:33.448 --> 00:58:36.350]  But it's part of a plan to make us helpless.
[00:58:36.350 --> 00:58:38.792]  And Trump doesn't like it, so he's Hitler.
[00:58:38.792 --> 00:58:41.073]  By the people that killed more than Hitler ever did.
[00:58:41.073 --> 00:58:42.154]  It's a joke.
[00:58:42.154 --> 00:58:44.455]  The Communist Chinese don't like Donald Trump.
[00:58:44.455 --> 00:58:45.196]  What does that tell you?
[00:58:45.196 --> 00:58:46.677]  CNNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.577 --> 00:58:53.378]  Anthony Gucciardi here with an InfoWars health news update with Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.378 --> 00:58:54.318]  That's right, Anthony.
[00:58:54.318 --> 00:58:57.099]  One of our top-selling products is BrainForce.
[00:58:57.099 --> 00:59:01.560]  It is very affordably priced at retail that we normally discount it.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:11.222]  We've discounted from the discount 25%, but if you count it from its regular price, that's 45% discount for a limited time at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:11.222 --> 00:59:17.044]  There are a lot of brain boosters out there, or what's known as nootropics, but here's what separates BrainForce from the rest.
[00:59:17.344 --> 00:59:29.151]  Unlike some energy drinks and supplements, Brain Force uses natural brain activation ingredients like Yerba Mate Extract, Alpha-GPC, L-Theanine, Hyperzine A, Phosphatidylserine, B12, and many others.
[00:59:29.151 --> 00:59:34.555]  Major nutraceutical review sites rave about this formulation, and they also rave about the price.

[00:59:46.542 --> 00:59:48.423]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:06.107]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:06.107 --> 01:00:08.390]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:14.042 --> 01:00:26.870]  Globalism is about training a country that you're broke back, you have no rights, and you have terms dictated to you by gangs of multinational combines, megacorporations, and the banks that own and control it through fraud.
[01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:33.494]  You know, the big six banks, the big five banks that package the same mortgage they don't even own and sell it up to a hundred times.
[01:00:33.494 --> 01:00:36.056]  And don't get in trouble for mass total fraud.
[01:00:36.056 --> 01:00:39.498]  These are Bernie Madoff scams thousands of times bigger.
[01:00:40.572 --> 01:01:01.736]  That have taken the world over through fraud, and now the Communist Chinese are saying we can't have Trump, and he's an enemy, and Trump comes out and says, you've hijacked our country, you have unfair trade deals, huge currency tariffs on us bare minimum, no environmental standards, there's no way we compete with you, we're not against you, but you can't screw us and have a 400 to 500 billion dollar a year trade deficit.
[01:01:02.901 --> 01:01:05.643]  Steve Watson has a new article, InfoWars.com.
[01:01:05.643 --> 01:01:07.544]  This article needs to go viral.
[01:01:07.544 --> 01:01:09.485]  Chinese government official.
[01:01:09.485 --> 01:01:13.847]  Trump presidency would mean us no longer a superpower.
[01:01:13.847 --> 01:01:16.949]  Chinese finance minister calls Trump an irrational type.
[01:01:16.949 --> 01:01:20.031]  Trump says China has waged economic war on US.
[01:01:20.031 --> 01:01:26.455]  China sells its political peaceful dissidents organs and then calls him in the People's Daily, Hitler.
[01:01:28.524 --> 01:01:33.806]  Let me tell you, China, the Communist Chinese wish they were as nice as Hitler, literally.
[01:01:33.806 --> 01:01:48.611]  Hitler may have killed, if you say to people he actually killed, maybe 7-8 million people that weren't military combatants and killed.
[01:01:48.611 --> 01:01:49.691]  They killed though about
[01:01:52.249 --> 01:01:54.652]  20 million Russians died, but a lot of it was starvation and things.
[01:01:54.652 --> 01:01:58.617]  But let's just say he killed 20 million Russians and another 7-8 million other people.
[01:01:58.617 --> 01:02:00.159]  Let's just say 27 million people.
[01:02:00.159 --> 01:02:01.180]  That's on the high end.
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:01.981]  Hitler, bad guy.
[01:02:03.373 --> 01:02:05.213]  I almost don't exist because of Hitler.
[01:02:05.213 --> 01:02:11.355]  I don't just mean George Soros' former operatives trying to shut me down and things, but my grandfather's post almost died fighting Hitler.
[01:02:11.355 --> 01:02:16.056]  That's why the ADL, you know, tries to make up stuff about me and Hitler, because I actually fight Hitler.
[01:02:16.056 --> 01:02:21.237]  If I was George Soros or Arnold Schwarzenegger, going around wearing actual Nazi outfits, it'd be okay.
[01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:21.677]  Seriously.
[01:02:21.677 --> 01:02:25.398]  I mean, if you're a Nazi, you get, like, awards and stuff from them.
[01:02:25.398 --> 01:02:28.419]  But if you almost don't exist because of the Nazis, you know, you're with them.
[01:02:30.492 --> 01:02:31.733]  There it is.
[01:02:31.733 --> 01:02:32.834]  Chinese government official.
[01:02:32.834 --> 01:02:35.255]  Trump presidency would mean U.S.
[01:02:35.255 --> 01:02:39.178]  no longer a superpower.
[01:02:39.178 --> 01:02:41.619]  So Hitler kills 27 million.
[01:02:41.619 --> 01:02:44.981]  And then Mao kills 84 million, according to the Chinese communists themselves.
[01:02:44.981 --> 01:02:47.083]  And then, of course, they've killed tens of millions since then.
[01:02:47.083 --> 01:02:54.407]  So these are the biggest, most bloodthirsty, hateful, evil people in the world.
[01:02:54.407 --> 01:02:55.448]  Criticize the government.
[01:02:55.448 --> 01:02:56.869]  Five years forced labor camp.
[01:02:56.869 --> 01:02:57.329]  Do it again.
[01:02:57.329 --> 01:02:58.150]  They sell your organs.
[01:03:01.343 --> 01:03:09.749]  And they're going to sit there with a straight face, the North Korea, the big North Korea, that's what China is, and lecture us about who we can have.
[01:03:09.749 --> 01:03:14.993]  And the average trendy loves being lectured by the Pope.
[01:03:14.993 --> 01:03:24.260]  I saw an article last week I didn't get to where Bernie Sanders went to the Vatican wall and it said Bernie Sanders did a press conference.
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.581]  I saw the headline, never saw the video.
[01:03:26.721 --> 01:03:32.487]  From the Vatican wall and praise the Pope on letting in immigrants.
[01:03:32.487 --> 01:03:34.168]  They got a 200-foot wall there!
[01:03:34.168 --> 01:03:36.551]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:03:36.551 --> 01:03:41.296]  Sanders greets supporters at the Vatican.
[01:03:41.296 --> 01:03:44.759]  You got two atheist dirtbag communists.
[01:03:44.759 --> 01:03:47.822]  See, that's a commie command base now, the Vatican, so he loves it.
[01:03:47.822 --> 01:03:50.405]  And there he is, below one of their smaller 50-foot walls.
[01:03:52.585 --> 01:03:54.967]  The headline is such an oxymoron.
[01:03:54.967 --> 01:04:04.074]  I want to praise you at your giant wall for calling for open borders, but no one inside your walled city.
[01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:09.419]  And Trump is a very dangerous person.
[01:04:09.419 --> 01:04:11.861]  There it is, outside Vatican walls.
[01:04:11.861 --> 01:04:17.505]  It's just the hypocrisy of these people has reached a new level.
[01:04:17.505 --> 01:04:19.487]  But see, they mean to have hypocrisy.
[01:04:19.487 --> 01:04:20.808]  They want oxymorons.
[01:04:20.808 --> 01:04:22.029]  They want to destroy logic.
[01:04:23.246 --> 01:04:26.628]  Truth is a menace, and logic is a crime.
[01:04:26.628 --> 01:04:33.133]  In fact, we should probably come in with the obsolete man with Rod Serling.
[01:04:33.133 --> 01:04:45.461]  You walk into this room, you walk into a world run by the globalists, where your intellect is seen as competition, and you're slated from birth to be turned into a drooling zombie.
[01:04:45.461 --> 01:04:46.021]  Well, guess what?
[01:04:46.021 --> 01:04:49.944]  This world's almost complete, but it's got a demolition
[01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:54.292]  Filing for the near future.
[01:04:54.292 --> 01:04:57.955]  And on the ticket that hangs on its toe, it says New World Order.
[01:04:57.955 --> 01:04:59.476]  Get on arrival.
[01:04:59.476 --> 01:05:02.219]  Today is Monday, April 18th, and here's some of the latest news.
[01:05:02.219 --> 01:05:06.663]  It's now known that the Colorado lawmakers who voted to scrap the state primary are in fact Ted Cruz delegates.
[01:05:06.663 --> 01:05:11.647]  Four state Republicans voted against a bill that would allow Colorado voters a chance to vote in a presidential primary.
[01:05:11.647 --> 01:05:16.451]  And all of them are Cruz supporters, with three of them listed as members of Cruz's Colorado leadership team.
[01:05:16.451 --> 01:05:18.313]  And one of them, Senator Kevin Grantham,
[01:05:18.533 --> 01:05:23.975]  Even had the audacity to brag about Cruz's quote victory on Twitter despite the fact that the voters did not get to pick a candidate.
[01:05:23.975 --> 01:05:31.639]  In other news, only 6% of people trust the mainstream media, putting the industry about equal to Congress and well below the public's view of other organizations.
[01:05:31.639 --> 01:05:36.461]  This lack of confidence in establishment media is fueled by inaccuracies in reporting and deceptive bias.
[01:05:36.781 --> 01:05:46.127]  Another study revealed that only 45% of Americans, over 77 million, will not pay an income tax this year because they have no taxable income or they received enough tax breaks to raise their liability.
[01:05:46.127 --> 01:05:48.749]  This says a lot about the current decline of the economy.
[01:05:48.749 --> 01:05:54.572]  You'd expect less tax revenue as more Americans leave the job market or stay underemployed at part-time jobs.

[01:05:59.461 --> 01:06:00.101]  Uh, yeah.
[01:06:00.101 --> 01:06:05.925]  First of all, I want to say, Tinker 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[01:06:05.925 --> 01:06:06.885]  I use them all.

[01:06:07.866 --> 01:06:08.626]  They work.
[01:06:08.626 --> 01:06:09.447]  Buy them, folks.
[01:06:09.447 --> 01:06:09.867]  Thank you, brother.
[01:06:09.867 --> 01:06:12.168]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:18.072]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[01:06:18.072 --> 01:06:20.073]  Welcome to the Info War.
[01:06:20.073 --> 01:06:25.496]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Info War at the same time.
[01:06:25.796 --> 01:06:26.776]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[01:06:26.776 --> 01:06:31.318]  I buy all the Nutraceuticals, Pacu FX, uh, Nascent... Mike, let me ask you a question.
[01:06:31.318 --> 01:06:32.358]  Have they worked for you?
[01:06:32.358 --> 01:06:35.219]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:06:35.219 --> 01:06:36.219]  What products are you taking?
[01:06:36.219 --> 01:06:42.581]  Are you taking... Everything from, uh, Super Male to, uh, Brain Force to Winter Sun, uh, X2.
[01:06:42.581 --> 01:06:44.582]  Even got a little, uh, DNA Force.
[01:06:44.582 --> 01:06:48.043]  So, and I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.

[01:07:00.810 --> 01:07:02.291]  You can't survive without it.
[01:07:02.291 --> 01:07:03.492]  But where do you get it?
[01:07:03.492 --> 01:07:09.476]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:07:09.476 --> 01:07:15.199]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:07:15.379 --> 01:07:32.249]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[01:08:02.944 --> 01:08:08.073]  You walk into this room at your own risk, because it leads to the future.
[01:08:08.073 --> 01:08:11.538]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[01:08:11.538 --> 01:08:13.782]  This is not a new world.
[01:08:13.782 --> 01:08:17.087]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[01:08:18.178 --> 01:08:26.606]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[01:08:26.606 --> 01:08:34.673]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[01:08:34.673 --> 01:08:40.399]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:42.621]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[01:08:47.981 --> 01:08:50.703]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[01:08:50.703 --> 01:08:57.368]  In his last 48 hours on Earth, he's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[01:08:57.368 --> 01:09:02.132]  Because he's built out of flesh, and because he has a mind.
[01:09:02.132 --> 01:09:06.816]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[01:09:13.004 --> 01:09:15.065]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:15.065 --> 01:09:16.966]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:09:16.966 --> 01:09:18.808]  We're on stations, of course, across the country.
[01:09:18.808 --> 01:09:31.715]  AM and FM, many UHF, VHF, and cable systems also pick up the transmission that's simulcast in living television color here in our InfoWars News Centers in Austin, Texas.
[01:09:31.715 --> 01:09:38.760]  InfoWars.com forward slash show if you wish to find the free video feeds and more.
[01:09:39.835 --> 01:09:42.437]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:09:42.437 --> 01:09:51.762]  And please don't forget there's massive censorship against the internet, against talk radio, against filmmakers now, not just here but all over the Western world.
[01:09:51.762 --> 01:10:05.051]  There is a concerted effort by both political parties in this country to complete the bankruptcy of this country and to roll us into a world government, to transfer our governmental powers to the non-elected IMF World Bank, and of course the
[01:10:06.055 --> 01:10:14.659]  World Trade Organization under agreements like the NAU, EU and TPP systems.
[01:10:14.659 --> 01:10:26.924]  The good news is Donald Trump's coming out and saying China with 35 to 40 percent currency tariffs on our goods is devastating this nation by design and economic warfare.
[01:10:26.924 --> 01:10:27.665]  He's telling the truth.
[01:10:28.581 --> 01:10:36.263]  Donald Trump is coming out and of course saying the Saudis were heavily involved in 9-11 with criminal elements inside our government and others.
[01:10:36.263 --> 01:10:37.523]  People say, well go all the way.
[01:10:37.523 --> 01:10:38.844]  It was more than that.
[01:10:38.844 --> 01:10:42.925]  The point is, for a major presidential frontrunner, this is devastating.
[01:10:42.925 --> 01:10:45.005]  He started it three months ago.
[01:10:45.005 --> 01:10:51.747]  And I'm not going to toot my horn, but let's just say repeatedly I have gotten info to Trump and then he's gone public with it.
[01:10:52.739 --> 01:10:54.941]  Stone was on months ago and said, watch next week.
[01:10:54.941 --> 01:10:59.424]  Trump's going to go public for auditing the private Federal Reserve.
[01:10:59.424 --> 01:11:01.726]  And he said, now to be clear, I didn't tell him to.
[01:11:01.726 --> 01:11:03.247]  He now knows it's the time.
[01:11:03.247 --> 01:11:06.049]  And he's been mad about that for 40 years.
[01:11:06.049 --> 01:11:07.631]  I talked to Dr. Corsi.
[01:11:07.631 --> 01:11:08.832]  He's known him 40 years.
[01:11:08.832 --> 01:11:12.114]  He says Trump is a sleeper patriot.
[01:11:12.114 --> 01:11:14.376]  Not a sleeper cell, but like a sleeper patriot.
[01:11:14.376 --> 01:11:15.797]  And that's why they're so scared of him.
[01:11:15.797 --> 01:11:18.019]  And now in a new AOL poll and others,
[01:11:20.174 --> 01:11:28.522]  Nearly half of Sanders supporters say they might switch to Trump just over the fact that he's being robbed when he's clearly the frontrunner as well.
[01:11:28.522 --> 01:11:33.467]  So, the gloves are off, the system is showing itself to be very naked.
[01:11:33.467 --> 01:11:35.129]  Ted Cruz is trying to spin all this.
[01:11:35.129 --> 01:11:36.190]  Here's the Daily Mail.
[01:11:36.190 --> 01:11:44.618]  Cruz claims he's won landslides, this is a quote, over and over, beating Trump in five consecutive states, even though only one of them held an election.
[01:11:47.677 --> 01:11:49.798]  He's walking a tightrope on Glenn Beck at Fox News.
[01:11:49.798 --> 01:11:59.326]  He goes on there and never says, he goes, the voters have spoken, and Trump is a sore loser, and then never says the party canceled the election.
[01:11:59.326 --> 01:12:09.094]  Or he won Louisiana, he won Georgia, he won Arizona, he won Tennessee, he won these other states, and then they just take the delegates and give them to Cruz.
[01:12:09.094 --> 01:12:12.096]  He just goes, I'm winning, I've got the Bushes behind me.
[01:12:12.096 --> 01:12:13.798]  He's talking more and more like Herbert Walker Bush.
[01:12:13.798 --> 01:12:15.059]  He says he's his mentor.
[01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.789]  Revealed.
[01:12:16.789 --> 01:12:20.552]  Colorado lawmakers who voted to scrap election are Ted Cruz delegates.
[01:12:20.552 --> 01:12:21.313]  Breitbart.
[01:12:21.313 --> 01:12:24.114]  Well, that's not really surprising.
[01:12:24.114 --> 01:12:24.815]  Exclusive.
[01:12:24.815 --> 01:12:25.615]  Trump campaign.
[01:12:25.615 --> 01:12:30.599]  Cruz staged attack in Georgia to steal delegates, not grassroots activism.
[01:12:30.599 --> 01:12:31.379]  RNC chief.
[01:12:31.379 --> 01:12:33.441]  No changes to delegate requirement likely.
[01:12:33.441 --> 01:12:34.902]  They're going to go ahead with the steal.
[01:12:37.896 --> 01:12:40.777]  It is simply amazing to see all this happen.
[01:12:40.777 --> 01:12:42.497]  I want to cover the waterfront with him.
[01:12:42.497 --> 01:12:44.878]  He's with us until about 40 after.
[01:12:44.878 --> 01:12:53.239]  Then we have Richard Reeves from New York on the eve of the primaries that start tomorrow.
[01:12:53.239 --> 01:12:55.700]  Looks like Trump's going to get 99 or more delegates.
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.640]  But if you add all the math up, he's going to be at like 116.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.102]  120, they're saying.
[01:13:05.102 --> 01:13:13.128]  But if you add it up, if Cruz hadn't stolen more than 70, 80 delegates, Trump would be way ahead if he wins these other states at the projections he's got.
[01:13:13.128 --> 01:13:14.530]  So this is really unprecedented.
[01:13:14.530 --> 01:13:17.712]  And again, I've got big issues with some of the things Trump does.
[01:13:17.712 --> 01:13:20.955]  He is, yeah, you know, Al Qaeda is not human, so let's torture them or whatever.
[01:13:20.955 --> 01:13:24.778]  We just become them or ISIS or, you know, let the FBI into the iPhone.
[01:13:24.778 --> 01:13:25.599]  He's not tech savvy.
[01:13:26.741 --> 01:13:28.821]  I told you the FBI was in that thing beforehand.
[01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:30.542]  Of course, they admit that now.
[01:13:30.542 --> 01:13:32.522]  But he's a nationalist.
[01:13:32.522 --> 01:13:34.583]  He doesn't want us to be screwed over.
[01:13:34.583 --> 01:13:36.343]  He just wants fair deals, and they hate him.
[01:13:36.343 --> 01:13:37.803]  They've got the M.O.
[01:13:37.803 --> 01:13:38.183]  on him.
[01:13:38.183 --> 01:13:41.604]  And I'm here to tell you, I've talked to people before he ran that said, have you ever talked to Donald Trump?
[01:13:41.604 --> 01:13:42.164]  And I'm like, no.
[01:13:42.164 --> 01:13:44.825]  They're like, boy, he sure is against the New World Order.
[01:13:44.825 --> 01:13:46.185]  And these are people that know him well.
[01:13:46.185 --> 01:13:48.185]  I'm going to stop right there.
[01:13:48.185 --> 01:13:48.806]  And I'm like, really?
[01:13:48.806 --> 01:13:49.486]  Donald Trump?
[01:13:49.486 --> 01:13:50.646]  Is that guy like a liberal?
[01:13:51.408 --> 01:13:55.851]  Because I knew he was on the East Coast, tried to work with people, and I'm like, no man, no.
[01:13:55.851 --> 01:13:58.352]  So, for whatever reason, they're scared of him.
[01:13:58.352 --> 01:14:18.644]  And I want to ask Wayne Madsen, formerly high-level with the National Security Agency, best-selling author, journalist, covering for decades what's happening on Capitol Hill, doesn't really need any introduction here, but I want to ask him why he thinks they're so scared of Trump, what he thinks they may do, and then, of course, that ties into the devastating victory for humanity and all the listeners, the viewers,
[01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:28.518]  Wayne Madsen is one of the only other people who, within days of 9-11 happening, came out and said, this thing absolutely stinks to high heaven.
[01:14:28.518 --> 01:14:30.340]  You know, during the break, let's just replace my earpiece.
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.481]  Whatever's going on, we've readjusted it four times.
[01:14:32.481 --> 01:14:33.402]  I just want to get a new one, thanks.
[01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:40.829]  It just keeps falling out for whatever reason, though we readjusted it, it's driving me crazy.
[01:14:40.829 --> 01:14:43.672]  Wayne Madsen was one of the only people
[01:14:44.718 --> 01:14:44.938]  We're good
[01:15:02.486 --> 01:15:19.574]  And we told you, Saudi Arabia helped run the attack, they at least helped create the Patsy's, there was a stand down, and then they tried to radically fundamentally change American liberty, to take our freedoms, launched all these wars, attacked the wrong country, Iraq, and now we're backing ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[01:15:20.779 --> 01:15:28.622]  Who Saudi Arabia runs, and Saudi Arabia is threatening to pull $750 billion out of the United States to quote, bankrupt us.
[01:15:28.622 --> 01:15:30.203]  That's the definition of terrorism.
[01:15:30.203 --> 01:15:38.106]  Threatening physical or economic harm for a political or economic reason.
[01:15:38.106 --> 01:15:47.050]  And you can pull up, there's different definitions, but it's basically threatening violence or economic harm unless your political or economic demands aren't met.
[01:15:47.050 --> 01:15:48.351]  And they're holding us hostage.
[01:15:50.677 --> 01:15:58.639]  Think about how this is now one of the number one stories here in the United States.
[01:15:58.639 --> 01:16:03.699]  And I guess this is the season of things here on the show.
[01:16:03.699 --> 01:16:06.420]  Can you guys come in and turn the Mac Mini off?
[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:08.040]  It's blaring protest stuff in here.
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:08.720]  Thanks.
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:16.742]  We have a really big complex studio and we've been adding a lot of equipment and a lot of things and it's playing a video behind Wayne Madsen right now.
[01:16:18.072 --> 01:16:19.633]  So we will get that shut down.
[01:16:19.633 --> 01:16:20.534]  Thank you very much.
[01:16:20.534 --> 01:16:22.876]  And again, Wayne Madsen will be with us now until about 45 after.
[01:16:22.876 --> 01:16:31.603]  I want to give him plenty of time and then we will be able to basically... Oh, I could have hit it right here on my butt.
[01:16:31.603 --> 01:16:33.224]  I've got too much equipment here.
[01:16:33.224 --> 01:16:37.748]  But seriously, this is a really, really big time right now because
[01:16:38.956 --> 01:16:42.138]  The fact that the gold and silver market are rigged, that's now mainstream news.
[01:16:42.138 --> 01:16:45.380]  The fact that the currency rates are rigged, that's now out.
[01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:48.202]  The fact that interest rates are rigged, that's now public.
[01:16:48.202 --> 01:16:51.965]  Everything's coming out.
[01:16:51.965 --> 01:16:54.687]  And the establishment, though, is just moving forward.
[01:16:54.687 --> 01:16:57.589]  So I want to ask Wayne where he sees all of this going.
[01:16:57.589 --> 01:17:02.893]  But, Wayne, do you agree with me that this is cause for celebration and that Donald Trump, kind of at the
[01:17:03.956 --> 01:17:07.385]  Coup de Grace at the end of the road helped push this over the edge.
[01:17:07.385 --> 01:17:11.636]  The fact that Saudi Arabian involvement in our government's bare minimum stand down.
[01:17:12.745 --> 01:17:22.193]  We know there's more there, but if this all comes out, congressmen that have seen it, Democrat and Republican, tell me it'll bring down the Bushes and the Clintons, and the quote, made them cry.
[01:17:22.193 --> 01:17:23.754]  We know what's in those pages.
[01:17:23.754 --> 01:17:25.976]  Where do you see all this going, Wayne Madsen?
[01:17:25.976 --> 01:17:38.427]  Well, for years, you know, myself and several other people have been calling for the 28 pages from that Congressional Intelligence Report on the failures of 9-11 to be released.
[01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:45.550]  Spoken to former Senator Robert Graham, Bob Graham.
[01:17:45.550 --> 01:17:47.551]  I've spoken to Walter Jones.
[01:17:47.551 --> 01:17:54.495]  I've spoken to quite a few of the members of Congress who have called for that release.
[01:17:54.495 --> 01:17:57.196]  And it's always been, you know, the immense
[01:17:57.956 --> 01:18:02.019]  Saudi lobby that has weighed in against any release.
[01:18:02.019 --> 01:18:09.404]  Now, the Obama administration has signaled it's willing to release it, but my question is, what is it going to look like?
[01:18:09.404 --> 01:18:21.533]  Will the release of the 28 pages, will the only thing that's not blacked out be the page numbers, as is often the case with, you know, major intelligence reports?
[01:18:21.533 --> 01:18:22.414]  I would also note that
[01:18:22.894 --> 01:18:31.184]  In the last week, we've finally seen most of the national intelligence estimate on Saddam Hussein and weapons of mass destruction.
[01:18:31.184 --> 01:18:33.968]  That's been released, the CIA report.
[01:18:33.968 --> 01:18:38.113]  And it says, right there, it says there was nothing to link
[01:18:38.613 --> 01:18:50.517]  Saddam Hussein with either 9-11 or WMDs and a lot of people I know in the intelligence community who are my sources and who suffered greatly because of what they said.
[01:18:50.517 --> 01:18:52.198]  They said the same thing.
[01:18:52.198 --> 01:18:55.339]  They said what was in that report and they contributed to that report.
[01:18:55.959 --> 01:18:56.400]  I don't
[01:19:14.179 --> 01:19:15.600]  He said, look, there's no evidence.
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:19.161]  I've been looking at the intercepts of Iraqi communication.
[01:19:19.161 --> 01:19:25.022]  There's no evidence of any connection between Saddam Hussein and WMDs.
[01:19:25.022 --> 01:19:33.665]  And yet, you know, he was basically targeted in an FBI, NSA security sting operation.
[01:19:33.665 --> 01:19:39.707]  Basically, what I heard that Dick Cheney said, we're going to make an example of some of these naysayers.
[01:19:40.427 --> 01:19:54.298]  And Ken Ford, unfortunately, was one of the people targeted by the real criminal, Dick Cheney, and his boss, who one could argue whether Bush knew really what was going on half the time he was drunk.
[01:19:54.298 --> 01:20:00.383]  Now, Wayne Madsen, you have amazing sources, some of them public, like Cybele Edmonds, FBI translator.
[01:20:01.294 --> 01:20:11.940]  But today, we're really releasing new info from the 9-11 congressional report, the 28 pages, because I've interviewed Jones and other members of Congress, so have you.
[01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:21.086]  You've talked to a lot of the sources who got in trouble under the persecution of whistleblowers, and so now we know what they said.
[01:20:22.786 --> 01:20:28.310]  13, 14, 15 years ago, depending on which whistleblower, has now been vetted and proven to be true.
[01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:39.958]  So these were valiant people that wouldn't fix intelligence and wouldn't frame Iraq after the fact at the FBI, at the CIA, at the Pentagon, and other areas.
[01:20:39.958 --> 01:20:45.822]  So let's spend the next 10 minutes before we go to break, because you're a top expert on this, fleshing out what's really in the 28 pages.
[01:20:47.003 --> 01:20:50.726]  And what the whistleblowers told us about it because they're the unsung heroes.
[01:20:50.726 --> 01:20:51.667]  Now this is coming out.
[01:20:51.667 --> 01:21:00.855]  I'm glad you reminded me that major persecution happened to the people that testified to Congress and others who didn't go along with the big lie.
[01:21:02.173 --> 01:21:02.674]  Right.
[01:21:02.674 --> 01:21:24.493]  Well, when you look back, these individuals, I've got to say they came from almost every agency imaginable, including some that people haven't heard of, like the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency was one of the places where people... Military officers at the Pentagon, people at NORAD, SAA, you name it.
[01:21:24.493 --> 01:21:28.016]  Treasury Department that were monitoring the money flows.
[01:21:28.016 --> 01:21:28.516]  They all suffered.
[01:21:29.637 --> 01:21:41.347]  You know, including Secretary of the Treasury, Paul O'Neill, who was basically run out of Washington because of what he found out about Saudi financing of the 9-11.
[01:21:41.347 --> 01:21:47.352]  Don't forget, John O'Neill, Deputy FBI Director, quit months before, went to be the head of security.
[01:21:47.352 --> 01:21:52.917]  His first day on the job was 9-11 at the towers, hired by the security firm of Marvin Bush.
[01:21:52.917 --> 01:21:54.478]  They sure killed two birds with one stone.
[01:21:55.018 --> 01:21:58.021]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:21:58.021 --> 01:22:03.525]  I never met John O'Neill, but I know where he used to go and drink in D.C.
[01:22:03.525 --> 01:22:11.151]  and the bartender who used to serve him told me how John O'Neill used to say, look, they're covering up for the Saudis.
[01:22:11.151 --> 01:22:13.153]  We've got them and there's going to be something.
[01:22:13.573 --> 01:22:15.357]  Really terrible is going to happen, of course.
[01:22:15.357 --> 01:22:18.382]  Well, he was in the London Independent a few months before 9-11.
[01:22:18.382 --> 01:22:21.147]  He gave a speech saying, we're covering up for the Saudis.
[01:22:21.147 --> 01:22:22.710]  There's going to be a giant terror attack.
[01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:23.692]  I'm trying to stop it.
[01:22:23.692 --> 01:22:25.475]  He left the FBI to try to stop it.
[01:22:26.607 --> 01:22:29.349]  Right, so what's in the report?
[01:22:29.349 --> 01:22:35.593]  From what I gather, it's going to basically, it names Prince Bandar.
[01:22:35.593 --> 01:22:37.234]  Remember Bandar Bush?
[01:22:37.234 --> 01:22:38.795]  He was so close to the Bush family.
[01:22:38.795 --> 01:22:41.057]  He got that nickname Bandar Bush.
[01:22:41.057 --> 01:22:43.558]  He was a Saudi ambassador to the United States.
[01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:46.060]  He was the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps.
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:48.662]  He'd been here longer than any other ambassador.
[01:22:48.662 --> 01:22:56.127]  So he's named, his wife was involved in transferring money to some of the actual hijackers who were then in San Diego.
[01:22:56.907 --> 01:23:03.329]  Let's be clear, the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., his wife wiring money to the hijackers, that is sensational.
[01:23:03.329 --> 01:23:07.010]  Yes, and it doesn't stop with Saudi Arabia.
[01:23:07.010 --> 01:23:14.753]  I've been told that the real gems in those 28 pages are what are contained in the footnoted material.
[01:23:15.773 --> 01:23:29.347]  I don't know if the footnotes are at the bottom of the page or they're back towards the end somewhere, but the footnoted material, if you look at that, it's like peeling back an onion layer by layer.
[01:23:29.347 --> 01:23:35.494]  You're going to get to some other countries in addition to Saudi Arabia that are implicated.
[01:23:37.967 --> 01:23:51.691]  Now, again, people get confused between the Congressional Report and the 9-11 Commission Report, but the mainstream media is trying to use quotes out of the 9-11 Commission Report to confuse people and to say that Saudi Arabia, you know, clear evidence wasn't shown.
[01:23:51.691 --> 01:23:56.153]  But even members of the 9-11 Commission say there was a cover-up and Saudi Arabia was involved.
[01:23:56.809 --> 01:24:11.303]  Yes, even the 9-11 Commission, and that's Governor Tom Kaine of New Jersey and Lee Hamilton, who used to be the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, both came out and said that they were lied to.
[01:24:11.303 --> 01:24:14.826]  So the 9-11 Commission report, you might as well throw that in a trash can.
[01:24:16.098 --> 01:24:27.647]  Now, the one we're talking about with the 28 pages was the joint congressional report done by the intelligence committees on the failures of 9-11.
[01:24:27.647 --> 01:24:29.088]  Why did it happen?
[01:24:29.088 --> 01:24:42.799]  They looked at it more closely than the 9-11 Commission, because what the 9-11 Commission did is they generated a report that was already written, which was basically a wish list of everything the Justice Department, the FBI, CINSA wanted.
[01:24:43.439 --> 01:24:44.600]  That's right and expanding on this
[01:25:01.232 --> 01:25:02.373]  We see the perfect storm.
[01:25:02.373 --> 01:25:06.336]  Saudi Arabia wants to take out Iraq, because then they can start going after Iran and Syria.
[01:25:06.336 --> 01:25:08.198]  That's all admitted.
[01:25:08.198 --> 01:25:14.303]  The globalists want to be able to have all their weapons sales, take domestic liberties away here in the United States.
[01:25:14.303 --> 01:25:17.545]  But the whole world used it to basically trample on freedoms.
[01:25:17.545 --> 01:25:19.287]  And then now they think we're so ignorant.
[01:25:19.287 --> 01:25:22.249]  Round two, they're funding ISIS, they're funding Al-Qaeda.
[01:25:22.249 --> 01:25:25.692]  It's now gone from a few thousand in Al-Qaeda to hundreds of thousands in ISIS.
[01:25:25.692 --> 01:25:27.354]  Very same Saudi flag they fly.
[01:25:27.354 --> 01:25:28.815]  It's just black, not green.
[01:25:29.315 --> 01:25:43.094]  And our media tries to cover up the link between Saudi Arabia and ISIS and Al Qaeda today, when the West and Obama and NATO are working with Saudi Arabia and their proxy armies with Turkey and others, Israel's involved too, to try to overthrow these countries.
[01:25:43.763 --> 01:25:44.984]  That's right.
[01:25:44.984 --> 01:25:51.568]  And the Saudi ambassador who replaced Bandar, this guy Jubeir, is now the Saudi foreign minister.
[01:25:51.568 --> 01:26:09.880]  He's basically in charge of this huge lobbying effort in Washington now to suppress the 28 pages, to basically twist the arms of members of Congress, and also now the Saudis are threatening to divest and sell off billions of dollars.
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:11.161]  750 billion.
[01:26:11.161 --> 01:26:13.183]  Isn't that going to cause a Streisand effect?
[01:26:14.143 --> 01:26:20.047]  Well, it may, but you know what, we have it now is Barack Obama going to Saudi Arabia.
[01:26:20.047 --> 01:26:22.448]  What's he, you know, what's he going over there to Apollo?
[01:26:22.448 --> 01:26:29.393]  And we've got emergency meetings with him and the head of the Federal Reserve in secret and the Treasury head that aren't supposed to happen under federal law.
[01:26:30.171 --> 01:26:30.871]  Right.
[01:26:30.871 --> 01:26:40.595]  And we know that his CIA director, John Brennan, if he's not a Wahhabist, he was also former station chief of the CIA in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
[01:26:40.595 --> 01:26:46.417]  If he's not a Wahhabist, he certainly has shown that he's very much pro-Wahhabist.
[01:26:46.997 --> 01:26:50.019]  Well, he's certainly on their payroll, so let's talk about that.
[01:26:50.019 --> 01:26:56.684]  I've talked to a lot of other high-level people, and they say Brennan, who lived there over 20 years, did convert to radical Islam, and that would show.
[01:26:56.684 --> 01:27:08.792]  Could this actually be a total double-cross, where they're not just going to use radical Islam to attack us in a type of giant Tet offensive down the road with sleeper cells, but they actually may be deciding to totally double-cross the West and bring it down?
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:13.403]  Well, we've seen a little bit of that with the Turks.
[01:27:13.403 --> 01:27:16.846]  You know, their government is basically Islamist.
[01:27:16.846 --> 01:27:19.469]  It's cozy with Saudi Arabia.
[01:27:19.469 --> 01:27:24.013]  And, you know, letting all these refugees flood into Europe.
[01:27:24.013 --> 01:27:25.054]  And what happens?
[01:27:25.054 --> 01:27:31.740]  You know, we've got this, you know, it's been called a weapon of mass migration.
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:33.082]  And we got Soros and
[01:27:33.582 --> 01:27:37.666]  And the head of the OECD saying, oh, yeah, well, this has to happen.
[01:27:37.666 --> 01:27:43.290]  These people need to replace the people who are retiring in the workforce in Europe.
[01:27:43.290 --> 01:27:46.253]  So there's more to it than just accepting refugees.
[01:27:46.253 --> 01:27:53.258]  There's people meeting behind the scenes that are looking at a new labor pool for Europe.
[01:27:55.077 --> 01:28:10.686]  But this labor pool of young men who are jihadists, they're not the kind of people you want taking jobs in Europe because they're going to effectively change what we know as Western civilization.
[01:28:10.686 --> 01:28:11.267]  Well, I know this.
[01:28:11.267 --> 01:28:17.811]  I went to high school and college with a lot of really nice Muslim people from Iraq, Jordan, you name it, Lebanese, awesome people, whether it be Christian or Muslim.
[01:28:18.732 --> 01:28:31.197]  But let me tell you, I mean, stereotype, people from Saudi Arabia, whether they be rich or not, are super arrogant, chip on the shoulder, very hateful, and they just feel super entitled and just walk around treating everybody like crap.
[01:28:31.197 --> 01:28:39.001]  And I just, why on earth would we want to bring millions of these people in here, military age men, when so many of them admit they're going to attack us?
[01:28:39.001 --> 01:28:42.802]  I mean, it's just, and then in Europe, if you criticize them, they arrest you.
[01:28:42.802 --> 01:28:46.504]  And I'm sure you've heard, if you criticize the Turkish president,
[01:28:46.804 --> 01:28:48.706]  Merkel will now have you arrested in Germany.
[01:29:07.762 --> 01:29:15.088]  By the way, the Shias, when you compare them to the Wahhabis, the Shias are like Unitarians or Quakers.
[01:29:15.088 --> 01:29:17.470]  I mean, in comparison.
[01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:26.557]  But the Iraqis, the Jordanians, the Yemenis, the Omanis, the Bahrainis, the Emiratis, the Kuwaitis have no time for the Saudis.
[01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:30.812]  For those that don't know, the Saudis were white slavers.
[01:29:30.812 --> 01:29:32.713]  That doesn't mean they only kidnapped white people.
[01:29:32.713 --> 01:29:33.774]  Sex slavers.
[01:29:33.774 --> 01:29:35.055]  They also robbed caravans.
[01:29:35.055 --> 01:29:36.736]  That's who they are.
[01:29:36.736 --> 01:29:38.217]  They are desert bandits.
[01:29:38.217 --> 01:29:43.200]  I mean, man, you wonder why they took Islam and turned it into, you know, keep women in slave pits?
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:44.721]  That's why the feminist groups love them.
[01:29:44.721 --> 01:29:46.282]  It's a form of cuckolding.
[01:29:46.282 --> 01:29:48.744]  Gloria Steinem and people just can't get enough of it.
[01:29:48.744 --> 01:29:50.124]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.124 --> 01:29:52.646]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.646 --> 01:29:55.348]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.437 --> 01:30:02.198]  Today is Monday, April 18th, and here's some of the latest news.
[01:30:02.198 --> 01:30:06.639]  It's now known that the Colorado lawmakers who voted to scrap the state primary are in fact Ted Cruz delegates.
[01:30:06.639 --> 01:30:11.600]  Four state Republicans voted against a bill that would allow Colorado voters a chance to vote in a presidential primary.
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:16.401]  And all of them are Cruz supporters, with three of them listed as members of Cruz's Colorado leadership team.
[01:30:16.401 --> 01:30:18.282]  And one of them, Senator Kevin Grantham,
[01:30:18.502 --> 01:30:23.944]  Even had the audacity to brag about Cruz's quote victory on Twitter despite the fact that the voters did not get to pick a candidate.
[01:30:23.944 --> 01:30:31.626]  In other news, only 6% of people trust the mainstream media, putting the industry about equal to Congress and well below the public's view of other organizations.
[01:30:31.626 --> 01:30:36.427]  This lack of confidence in establishment media is fueled by inaccuracies in reporting and deceptive bias.
[01:30:36.747 --> 01:30:46.114]  Another study revealed that only 45% of Americans, over 77 million, will not pay an income tax this year because they have no taxable income or they received enough tax breaks to raise their liability.
[01:30:46.114 --> 01:30:48.716]  This says a lot about the current decline of the economy.
[01:30:48.716 --> 01:30:54.560]  You'd expect less tax revenue as more Americans leave the job market or stay underemployed at part-time jobs.

[01:33:11.266 --> 01:33:15.452]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:15.452 --> 01:33:16.874]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.009 --> 01:33:29.010]  Wayne Madsen is our guest for another 10 minutes.
[01:33:29.010 --> 01:33:34.874]  Then joining us from the campaign trail will be Richard Reeves, who is on the ground in New York.
[01:33:34.874 --> 01:33:37.995]  Then Lou Rockwell joins us to look at the big steal 2016.
[01:33:37.995 --> 01:33:40.857]  We're about to go back to Wayne Madsen here in just a moment.
[01:33:40.857 --> 01:33:42.398]  I need to get on the phone with Wayne Madsen and
[01:33:43.516 --> 01:33:47.200]  The War Game with him is an investigative journalist that does work for InfoWars.
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:49.523]  They carry a lot of his stories at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:49.523 --> 01:33:51.725]  He is a member of the team.
[01:33:51.725 --> 01:33:54.308]  He has a lot of other great reports at WayneMadisonReport.com.
[01:33:54.308 --> 01:33:57.051]  You can also find his books there.
[01:33:57.051 --> 01:33:58.993]  But we're going to be going to Cleveland.
[01:33:58.993 --> 01:34:00.695]  We're also going to be going to the DNC.
[01:34:01.676 --> 01:34:06.160]  And of course the real action is going to be outside, but I have passes to the inside.
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:07.581]  I had to get them another way though.
[01:34:07.581 --> 01:34:11.044]  The RNC, and I've gotten them before, is not giving them to me.
[01:34:11.044 --> 01:34:13.926]  I'm going to have to sue them or file a complaint or something.
[01:34:13.926 --> 01:34:17.930]  They just ignore us when we call and give us the runaround.
[01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:20.031]  But I'll end up getting it another way, just not as pressed.
[01:34:20.031 --> 01:34:21.853]  But really, there's not much going on inside.
[01:34:21.853 --> 01:34:22.714]  You can't watch on TV.
[01:34:24.215 --> 01:34:37.084]  The real action is going to be on the outside, but I wanted to ask Wayne Madsen what he wants to cover for us, so we go ahead and get him in place as well to cover both of those conventions with our crews as well.
[01:34:37.084 --> 01:34:49.312]  So Wayne Madsen, part of the team, and you notice that team is expanding because the globalists are engaging in so many crimes openly, and as people realize that we know what we're talking about, we get more and more support.
[01:34:49.312 --> 01:34:49.933]  But with that,
[01:34:51.826 --> 01:34:52.186]  Come on, man.
[01:35:13.257 --> 01:35:37.637]  The best mini cook stoves, the best crank-powered shortwave radios, the highest quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply, private-labeled for InfoWarsLife.com, private-labeled under InfoWars Select, the freshest, newest, highest quality, special diet packages, you name it, you're not going to find food of this quality anywhere near this price anywhere.
[01:35:37.637 --> 01:35:38.578]  And look, I hope that
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:43.842]  We don't need to ever use this storable food, but it is insurance you can always eat.
[01:35:43.842 --> 01:35:44.983]  It's very tasty.
[01:35:44.983 --> 01:35:53.508]  But as crazy as the world is steaming towards depression, I've been getting medical supplies, I've been getting more storable food, I've got my firearms in line.
[01:35:53.508 --> 01:35:55.229]  I'm hoping we don't have war with Russia.
[01:35:55.229 --> 01:35:58.871]  I'm hoping the depression isn't as bad as many elites believe.
[01:35:59.551 --> 01:36:09.015]  But it's all over the news now that the millionaires are moving out of Chicago because they think it's going to collapse and that billionaires are buying armored redoubts all over the US and Europe.
[01:36:09.015 --> 01:36:12.216]  Stuff I told you six years ago.
[01:36:12.216 --> 01:36:14.417]  Big stuff's coming.
[01:36:14.417 --> 01:36:16.637]  All Hades is breaking loose around the world.
[01:36:16.637 --> 01:36:19.158]  We're on top of a mega massive bubble.
[01:36:19.158 --> 01:36:23.660]  And all Donald Trump's done is said maybe we should put the brakes on and so they say he's the new Hitler.
[01:36:25.569 --> 01:36:28.031]  Anybody who's a nationalist is now the new bad guy.
[01:36:28.031 --> 01:36:34.176]  So please support the broadcast and know that your purchases are essential to what we do.
[01:36:34.176 --> 01:36:37.179]  The very best nootropic brain force.

[01:36:50.089 --> 01:36:52.291]  This is a great introductory price to try it.
[01:36:52.291 --> 01:36:53.012]  Infowars.
[01:36:54.355 --> 01:36:59.938]  Life.com is the subsection that has all of our supplements and nutraceuticals.
[01:36:59.938 --> 01:37:03.919]  DNA Force Plus is now back in stock.
[01:37:03.919 --> 01:37:08.742]  Patented form of the antioxidant CoQ10, BioPQQ, that's the big one.
[01:37:08.742 --> 01:37:16.665]  Patented digestive enzymes, immune boosting, astragalus root, pomegranate extract, plant-based resveratrol, and a lot more.
[01:37:16.665 --> 01:37:17.706]  It's back in stock.
[01:37:17.706 --> 01:37:21.867]  Just one of the ingredients, BioPQQ, is patented.
[01:37:21.867 --> 01:37:22.688]  It is the only
[01:37:24.193 --> 01:37:30.240]  Naturally occurring, naturally produced, that's not synthetic, BioPQQ out there in the world.
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:34.886]  That's why it costs $30,000 for us to run a batch just for the BioPQQ.
[01:37:34.886 --> 01:37:36.247]  What is it?
[01:37:36.247 --> 01:37:36.768]  $14,000 a kilo.
[01:37:36.768 --> 01:37:39.051]  It takes more than two kilos in each batch.
[01:37:39.051 --> 01:37:40.973]  That's why this is such a game changer.
[01:37:40.973 --> 01:37:42.515]  That's why it's somewhat expensive.
[01:37:43.375 --> 01:37:46.716]  Similar stuff out there that you get at medical facilities from doctors.
[01:37:46.716 --> 01:37:48.477]  It's not prescription, but that's where you get it.
[01:37:48.477 --> 01:37:50.518]  It's $300 to $400 a bottle.
[01:37:50.518 --> 01:37:56.340]  Ours is $134 a bottle, and it's turning heads across the industry because it's such a nutraceutical.
[01:37:56.340 --> 01:38:08.585]  But then we've got stuff like, you know, high-quality silver bullet colloidal silver for $5 less than the leading competitor when it's the very same private labeled colloidal silver at InfoWarsLife.com, or you can call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:38:12.816 --> 01:38:15.855]  Now, going back to Wayne Madsen and a little bit of time we have left with Wayne.
[01:38:16.761 --> 01:38:19.403]  Wayne, you've heard me throw out a lot of points here.
[01:38:19.403 --> 01:38:20.984]  The election theft.
[01:38:20.984 --> 01:38:23.086]  Why are they so scared of Trump?
[01:38:23.086 --> 01:38:24.707]  What's other big news you're working on?
[01:38:24.707 --> 01:38:30.252]  I know you've broken some big stories as well that are at WayneMadsenReport.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:38:30.252 --> 01:38:34.215]  Karl Rove backing Cruz and Clinton at the same time.
[01:38:34.215 --> 01:38:38.778]  Also, you asked, was Cruz's father linked to the JFK assassination?
[01:38:38.778 --> 01:38:44.363]  Cuban hired by Lee Harvey Oswald bears a striking resemblance, but we know he was tied into these very groups.
[01:38:45.424 --> 01:38:52.054]  So we can, and the Bush's were running an operation, we know he later, Cruz himself came to work for the Bush's.
[01:38:52.054 --> 01:38:54.939]  So let's cover those issues right now, Wayne.
[01:38:54.939 --> 01:38:59.085]  Well yeah, the one I'm currently working on is the Raphael Cruz.
[01:39:00.487 --> 01:39:05.090]  There's actually, um, there's like three Raphael Cruzes.
[01:39:05.090 --> 01:39:12.894]  This gets really complicated, but when I'm looking at the background of the Cruz family, I think we got another Obama.
[01:39:12.894 --> 01:39:15.915]  We've got CIA people on both sides, mom and dad.
[01:39:17.396 --> 01:39:32.607]  And the photograph, the one with Lee Harvey Oswald pamphleteering in front of the International Trademark in New Orleans, by the way, which was owned by Clay Shaw, who was the main target of Jim Garrison's investigation.
[01:39:33.367 --> 01:39:42.413]  We have the only guy not identified in that photograph is the guy that looks a lot like Rafael Cruz.
[01:39:42.413 --> 01:39:46.855]  I've got the FBI report from November 1963.
[01:39:46.855 --> 01:39:50.438]  They were not able to identify that individual.
[01:39:50.438 --> 01:39:52.999]  The House Select Committee on Assassinations of 1978.
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:40:04.248]  Robert Blakey, the General Counsel, recently reaffirmed after he appeared on Frontline, he said, we don't know who that guy is.
[01:40:04.248 --> 01:40:05.849]  We never determined who that guy is.
[01:40:07.065 --> 01:40:18.310]  Well, even if you're not going to use the photo as evidence of Raphael's ties to the people in New Orleans that were being looked at by Jim Garrison, let's look at his company he worked for.
[01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:29.555]  He said he was a geophysical computer guy for this company that was owned by a French oil services company, Schlumberger.
[01:40:29.555 --> 01:40:31.656]  The heir to the Schlumberger company.
[01:40:32.536 --> 01:40:42.880]  Jean de Menil winds up as a member of the board of directors of Permandex out of New Orleans, which was a CIA front company run by who?
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:44.241]  Clay Shaw.
[01:40:44.241 --> 01:40:48.463]  The photograph of the Raphael Cruz lookalike is taken where?
[01:40:48.463 --> 01:40:52.665]  In front of the international trademark owned by Clay Shaw.
[01:40:52.665 --> 01:40:58.127]  So even if you don't use the photograph as evidence, you got to look at the business ties as evidence.
[01:40:58.127 --> 01:40:59.367]  And here's the scariest thing.
[01:41:01.463 --> 01:41:10.054]  Ted Cruz has just hired a company called Strategic Communications Laboratories out of London, where his mom lived from 1960 to 1966.
[01:41:13.912 --> 01:41:26.926]  Married to a guy over there who we don't know what he did for a living, but this company specializes in mass deception, psychological warfare, influence operations, and behavioral modification.
[01:41:26.926 --> 01:41:27.446]  It's U.S.
[01:41:27.446 --> 01:41:33.593]  subsidiary Cambridge Analytics has been retained by the Cruz for President campaign as an advisor.
[01:41:35.222 --> 01:41:48.149]  Now, after I broke the story about New Orleans, and the possibility that it's Raphael Cruz there pamphleting with Lee Harvey Oswald, I've been attacked, and it's always the same characters.
[01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:50.811]  One of the attacking sites is Wong Keat.
[01:41:50.811 --> 01:41:58.335]  They were the same site nine years ago that attacked me for reporting that Dennis Hastert was involved in molesting
[01:41:58.735 --> 01:41:59.776]  We're good to go.
[01:42:18.559 --> 01:42:20.220]  I don't need those prizes.
[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:24.082]  I've been to these ceremonies where these people award each other prizes.
[01:42:24.082 --> 01:42:26.924]  It's really disgusting because... No, no, I agree.
[01:42:26.924 --> 01:42:29.105]  You don't want a Nobel Prize or a Pulitzer, no.
[01:42:29.801 --> 01:42:34.926]  No, I mean, you're basically, to get one of those, you're submitting to some control.
[01:42:34.926 --> 01:42:40.450]  So, if you get one, if I ever got anything like that, I'd say, I messed up.
[01:42:40.450 --> 01:42:42.552]  How did I, how the hell did I get one of these?
[01:42:42.552 --> 01:42:47.056]  I shouldn't be getting one of these because, you know, people that get those are part of the system.
[01:42:47.056 --> 01:42:51.901]  But the story on Rafael Cruz and the grandparents,
[01:42:52.981 --> 01:42:58.504]  His name was, look, Ted Cruz's father was Rafael Bienvenidos Cruz.
[01:42:58.504 --> 01:43:01.085]  His father was Rafael Bienvenidos Cruz.
[01:43:01.085 --> 01:43:09.089]  Now, I'm trying to look up records on people with the same last names, but the grandparents came from Cuba in 1966.
[01:43:09.089 --> 01:43:10.769]  Rafael came in 57.
[01:43:10.769 --> 01:43:14.431]  He said he came to escape Castro's Cuba.
[01:43:14.431 --> 01:43:18.373]  In 57, Castro wasn't in power for another three years, so he lied about that.
[01:43:19.193 --> 01:43:31.086]  His father worked for RCA in Cuba at a time when RCA was involved in a lot of anti-communist activities, including setting up clandestine radio stations for the CIA.
[01:43:31.086 --> 01:43:35.210]  So, you know, what do we know about the Cruz family?
[01:43:35.210 --> 01:43:38.434]  Right now we know about as much as we know about Obama's family in 2008.
[01:43:40.075 --> 01:43:51.871]  And, uh, mea culpa, I didn't look at Obama's family back then, and I found out soon enough, weeks after his inauguration, how he was linked to the CIA.
[01:43:51.871 --> 01:43:53.913]  And it turns out the whole family was.
[01:43:53.913 --> 01:43:57.178]  Well, I'll tell you, Cruz's dad does have a, um...
[01:43:58.638 --> 01:44:19.975]  Interesting looking features that are somewhat unique, and it does look like a spitting image of his dad, but then you add it in together with the whole Cuban community, how he's one of the early communities, how he's hooked into all these different skunk works type organizations, and then how his son goes right up at the top with the Bushes, who we know are running the operation to kill Kennedy, George Herbert Walker Bush Sr.
[01:44:20.976 --> 01:44:24.785]  Who's come out and declassified documents to have been in the CIA in the early 60s.
[01:44:24.785 --> 01:44:27.511]  He lied about it when he became the director in the 70s.
[01:44:27.511 --> 01:44:29.396]  Just magically the director but never been in it.
[01:44:30.646 --> 01:44:39.714]  Yeah, and one of the guys in that photograph in front of the trademark at the far right is Chauncey Holt, who was the accountant for Meyer Lansky, the mobster.
[01:44:39.714 --> 01:44:51.224]  And Chauncey Holt apparently told author Ed Haslam, who wrote a book about all this in New Orleans in those years, that
[01:44:52.365 --> 01:44:56.806]  All the Cubans in that photograph were part of the CIA's Operation Mongoose.
[01:44:56.806 --> 01:45:00.747]  That was the clandestine program to overthrow Fidel Castro.
[01:45:00.747 --> 01:45:09.829]  And Oswald was there doing all this just to sheep-dip these people as part of a pro-Castro movement.
[01:45:09.829 --> 01:45:11.289]  Sure, it's a cover.
[01:45:11.289 --> 01:45:11.909]  Absolutely.
[01:45:11.909 --> 01:45:13.850]  This is to get our legend going.
[01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:15.330]  Let's shift gears out of this.
[01:45:15.330 --> 01:45:18.311]  What do you make of Trump with the Communist Chinese government now coming out?
[01:45:19.272 --> 01:45:21.716]  Saying, you know, we're going to have a trade war with you.
[01:45:21.716 --> 01:45:23.579]  You're not going to be a superpower if you go for Trump.
[01:45:23.579 --> 01:45:25.903]  Trump's saying, hey, you're involved in economic warfare.
[01:45:25.903 --> 01:45:28.567]  What do you make of the Saudis getting so mad at him?
[01:45:28.567 --> 01:45:29.849]  What are you thinking about Trump these days?
[01:45:31.141 --> 01:45:38.444]  Well, I mean, I think he's absolutely right to be upset about the theft of delegates by Ted Cruz.
[01:45:38.444 --> 01:45:43.887]  I ran across this when I covered the 2000 campaign in a Republican convention.
[01:45:43.887 --> 01:45:45.948]  That year it was in Philadelphia.
[01:45:45.948 --> 01:45:52.571]  And I remember McCain was running against Bush for that nomination.
[01:45:52.571 --> 01:45:56.653]  And McCain won the state of Michigan, which was a winner-take-all state.
[01:45:57.173 --> 01:46:03.761]  So here I see Michigan Governor John Engler on the street, and I said, Governor, can I have a word with you?
[01:46:03.761 --> 01:46:13.332]  And I said, how come you're here representing Michigan when Michigan was a winner take all, McCain won it, and you're the co-chair of the Bush
[01:46:13.732 --> 01:46:21.275]  For president campaign in Michigan, he says, oh, we just couldn't allow anybody coming off the street to say they were a McCain delegate.
[01:46:21.275 --> 01:46:22.195]  We had to vet them.
[01:46:22.195 --> 01:46:28.298]  And in that process, McCain lost a lot of his delegates in winner-take-all Michigan.
[01:46:28.298 --> 01:46:37.121]  Look for the same thing to happen in Florida, where Trump won every county except for Rubio's Miami-Dade in winner-take-all.
[01:46:37.621 --> 01:46:38.302]  We'll see.
[01:46:38.302 --> 01:46:39.102]  They've already done that.
[01:46:39.102 --> 01:46:40.183]  They're already taking Georgia.
[01:46:40.183 --> 01:46:41.144]  They're already taking Tennessee.
[01:46:41.144 --> 01:46:42.865]  They're already taking Arizona.
[01:46:42.865 --> 01:46:44.767]  All these states where he wins, they just take it.
[01:46:44.767 --> 01:46:48.850]  And then Cruz gets up there and says, I've won a grassroots uprising.
[01:46:48.850 --> 01:46:50.571]  The voters have spoken.
[01:46:50.571 --> 01:46:54.034]  Talk about a psy-op, and he never says it was voterless.
[01:46:54.034 --> 01:47:00.019]  And then they criticize myself and Drudge and others, because we dare to point out they're now going voterless like never before.
[01:47:00.019 --> 01:47:02.461]  Is this a sign of desperation or arrogance, Wayne?
[01:47:03.101 --> 01:47:06.344]  Well, look at the people who have climbed onto the Cruz campaign.
[01:47:06.344 --> 01:47:09.386]  You've got Neil Bush acting as an advisor to him.
[01:47:09.386 --> 01:47:13.129]  He's a crook from the Silverado saving and loan collapse.
[01:47:13.129 --> 01:47:14.891]  We've got Jeb endorsing him.
[01:47:14.891 --> 01:47:21.296]  And then we have David Dewhurst, the former lieutenant governor of Texas, who ran against Cruz for the Senate.
[01:47:21.976 --> 01:47:30.322]  Uh, nomination lost in the primary, uh, and all of a sudden he comes out and endorses a guy who he absolutely had no time for, Ted Cruz.
[01:47:30.322 --> 01:47:31.022]  Why?
[01:47:31.022 --> 01:47:34.244]  Well, who did, you know, what agency did David Dewhurst use?
[01:47:34.244 --> 01:47:35.325]  CIA.
[01:47:35.325 --> 01:47:37.166]  And by the way, he wasn't just some analyst.
[01:47:37.166 --> 01:47:40.649]  He was down in Central and South America with Klaus Barbie.
[01:47:41.334 --> 01:47:44.477]  Yes, and you know what?
[01:47:44.477 --> 01:47:46.979]  This is all home week with the Cruz campaign.
[01:47:46.979 --> 01:47:58.608]  They're all coming together, David Dewhurst and the Bushes, and we're to believe that Rafael Cruz lived in Dallas and then moved to New Orleans in the early 60s.
[01:47:58.608 --> 01:48:10.238]  And now this crew of narcotics-trafficking, rogue government CIA people are telling us we don't get to vote in America anymore, and they have the Chinese Communist calling Trump Hitler when they've killed 84 million people.
[01:48:11.018 --> 01:48:16.625]  Yeah, I would note that Ted Cruz's dad decides to leave New Orleans in 67 to move to Calgary.
[01:48:16.625 --> 01:48:22.972]  That's the same year Jim Garrison began his investigation of exactly who was with Oswald in 1963.
[01:48:22.972 --> 01:48:27.517]  You know, gee, Rafael, you sure got out of the country fast.
[01:48:28.759 --> 01:48:30.060]  Amazing, amazing.
[01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:31.160]  Wayne, let's talk.
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:32.942]  Call me this afternoon or just tell me.
[01:48:32.942 --> 01:48:35.003]  Send an email to the news director.
[01:48:35.003 --> 01:48:36.525]  I know we're getting everything coordinated.
[01:48:36.525 --> 01:48:44.971]  What you think we ought to target, what you want to do in Cleveland, but also there when the Democrats meet later in Philly.
[01:48:44.971 --> 01:48:45.852]  So let's get this going.
[01:48:46.969 --> 01:48:47.570]  Absolutely.
[01:48:47.570 --> 01:49:04.488]  I think you're right, though, that in both Philly and Cleveland, we're going to see a lot of protesters, Sanders protesters out in the streets in Philly and Trump people out in the streets in Cleveland if more of the chicanery... And by the way, Trump's come out and said,
[01:49:04.548 --> 01:49:05.208]  I don't want violence.
[01:49:05.208 --> 01:49:07.850]  You're gonna have a lot of mad people if you steal the election in Cleveland.
[01:49:07.850 --> 01:49:10.012]  I'm concerned when he's at a police union in New York.
[01:49:10.012 --> 01:49:13.294]  I saw the clip on Fox this morning and they act like he was calling for violence.
[01:49:13.294 --> 01:49:14.195]  No he wasn't.
[01:49:14.195 --> 01:49:22.041]  It's the Soros Democratic Party Black Lives Matter crews that are openly running around calling for violence and our crews have been all over the country documenting it.
[01:49:23.038 --> 01:49:27.640]  Right, and remember who his major opponent Cruz has working for him.
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:36.264]  A company that's tied to the CIA that specializes in mass deception, psychological warfare, influence operations, and behavioral modification.
[01:49:36.264 --> 01:49:39.546]  And we know through history the CIA has used the media
[01:49:40.106 --> 01:49:41.087]  Sure, sure.
[01:49:41.087 --> 01:49:49.611]  And what that means is really fancy lying, where he gets up there and goes, I won all the popular votes in these states and Trump's mad, hoping you don't go look and they canceled the elections.
[01:49:49.611 --> 01:49:51.612]  I mean, it's just called brazen lies.
[01:49:51.612 --> 01:49:54.814]  They just charge him a bunch of money to teach him how to be a con artist.
[01:49:54.814 --> 01:49:55.434]  It's amazing.
[01:49:55.434 --> 01:50:00.817]  Listen, I'm on the knife's edge about going to Germany, to Dresden to cover Bilderberg in the middle of June.
[01:50:00.817 --> 01:50:04.359]  But regardless, I'm looking to want to send you and some other people.
[01:50:04.359 --> 01:50:06.460]  So let's talk today, Wayne Madsen.
[01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:07.141]  Absolutely.
[01:50:07.141 --> 01:50:07.901]  Okay.
[01:50:07.901 --> 01:50:08.221]  All right.
[01:50:08.221 --> 01:50:09.022]  So you want to go to Germany?
[01:50:09.997 --> 01:50:11.180]  I'll be over there, sure.
[01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:12.102]  Alright, let's wind it up.
[01:50:12.102 --> 01:50:13.707]  Alright, we're going to break, folks.

[01:50:19.147 --> 01:50:21.588]  And I'll open some phones up when Rockwell's on with us.
[01:50:21.588 --> 01:50:24.568]  Briefly, sending reporters to Germany to cover Bilderberg?
[01:50:24.568 --> 01:50:25.429]  Expensive.
[01:50:25.429 --> 01:50:26.909]  You want the intel?

[01:54:41.543 --> 01:54:43.124]  Richard wouldn't tell us his location.
[01:54:43.124 --> 01:54:44.504]  He's got something to surprise us on air.
[01:54:44.504 --> 01:54:50.506]  We're going to go to Richard Reeves, my good buddy and InfoWars political correspondent joining us, I would guess from New York, probably Trump Tower.
[01:54:50.506 --> 01:54:51.026]  I'm not sure.
[01:54:51.026 --> 01:54:52.346]  We're about to find out.
[01:54:52.346 --> 01:54:53.527]  But before we go any further,
[01:54:55.402 --> 01:55:00.105]  I cannot express to you that huge exciting things are happening, good, bad and ugly.
[01:55:00.105 --> 01:55:09.051]  And when I say we're starting to turn the tide against tyranny and that evil is in trouble, I'm not saying that as a cheerleader, I'm saying it because it's true.
[01:55:09.051 --> 01:55:13.714]  And it's a big deal that Saudi Arabia's role in 9-11 is coming out.
[01:55:13.714 --> 01:55:18.557]  Because a lot of whistleblowers lost their jobs, got in trouble and got killed so we'd know the truth.
[01:55:20.011 --> 01:55:22.472]  The globalists are in trouble.
[01:55:22.472 --> 01:55:26.734]  The Pentagon said no to backing Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[01:55:26.734 --> 01:55:28.795]  So they changed the name to ISIS.
[01:55:28.795 --> 01:55:32.557]  I mean, so many good people in government and out of government are saying no.
[01:55:32.557 --> 01:55:34.038]  The New World Order is having trouble.
[01:55:34.038 --> 01:55:35.999]  And now they want to tell us Trump is Hitler.
[01:55:37.182 --> 01:55:41.844]  The Communist Chinese, the biggest mass murderers in history, because they got deals screwing us!
[01:55:41.844 --> 01:55:51.347]  And they got a bunch of collaborators in our media and the left and the Republicans going along with foreign leaders that are mass murderer connected lecturing us.
[01:55:51.347 --> 01:55:53.407]  It's over!
[01:55:53.407 --> 01:55:55.008]  So we win because of Trump running.
[01:55:55.008 --> 01:55:56.809]  Even if they cheat him, they do it in front of everybody.
[01:55:56.809 --> 01:56:00.130]  I know he's got a lot to talk about in the 10-15 minutes we've got with him.
[01:56:00.130 --> 01:56:03.031]  Richard Reeves is in, I'm guessing, New York.
[01:56:03.031 --> 01:56:03.671]  Where are you, Richard?
[01:56:05.333 --> 01:56:14.840]  We do have a lot to talk about, and before I reveal my surprise location, I gotta say, that piece that you and Wayne Madsen just did, that is completely best of.
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:16.181]  Totally best of.
[01:56:16.181 --> 01:56:23.906]  This audience, anybody that calls themselves a journalist, if they're not listening to the Alex Jones Show on a daily basis, then they're not a journalist.
[01:56:23.906 --> 01:56:24.587]  They're missing out.
[01:56:25.157 --> 01:56:27.241]  It's incredible what Wayne Madsen did.
[01:56:27.241 --> 01:56:30.046]  Now, I know this breaks protocol, but I am actually here.
[01:56:30.046 --> 01:56:38.120]  I'm on the way to shuffling off to Buffalo here after this interview, but I am actually in Cleveland at the Quicken Loans Arena right across the street, right behind me.
[01:56:38.624 --> 01:56:45.193]  I don't know if they had any idea when they paid the big bucks for that sponsorship if they knew they were going to be ground zero for what's coming up.
[01:56:45.193 --> 01:56:46.235]  But they are.
[01:56:46.235 --> 01:56:48.277]  So, yeah, we've got a lot to talk about.
[01:56:48.277 --> 01:56:50.460]  Wayne Manson piece, just incredible information.
[01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:52.083]  Yeah, just bombshell after bombshell.
[01:56:52.083 --> 01:56:55.227]  He was breaking down what's in the 28 pages because he's interviewed the people that put it together.
[01:56:56.483 --> 01:56:57.063]  Absolutely.
[01:56:57.063 --> 01:57:06.388]  And speaking of 9-11, the 28 pages, there are people, as of even today, that, oh, you know, us talking about 9-11, Inside Job, the 28 pages, etc.
[01:57:06.388 --> 01:57:09.189]  Hey, take your tinfoil hat off, Alex.
[01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:11.010]  Take your tinfoil hat off, Richard Reeves.
[01:57:11.010 --> 01:57:13.372]  Take your tinfoil hat off, InfoWire's crew.
[01:57:13.372 --> 01:57:14.092]  Well, guess what?
[01:57:14.532 --> 01:57:16.193]  They've all put on their tinfoil hat.
[01:57:16.193 --> 01:57:17.054]  They're joining in on it.
[01:57:17.054 --> 01:57:17.294]  I know.
[01:57:17.294 --> 01:57:21.678]  What's it like when it's the New York Post saying, U.S.
[01:57:21.678 --> 01:57:23.719]  government covered up Saudi role.
[01:57:23.719 --> 01:57:23.979]  U.S.
[01:57:23.979 --> 01:57:26.141]  government stood down on 9-11.
[01:57:26.141 --> 01:57:27.582]  We're proven correct.
[01:57:27.582 --> 01:57:29.163]  I gotta tell you, it feels good.
[01:57:29.163 --> 01:57:31.505]  Because it means the criminals are gonna get brought to justice.
[01:57:31.505 --> 01:57:33.126]  There's a better chance of that now.
[01:57:33.126 --> 01:57:34.487]  This is so exciting, Richard.
[01:57:34.487 --> 01:57:37.549]  Those arrogant bastards, when they did this, thought they'd get away with it.
[01:57:37.549 --> 01:57:38.030]  Well, guess what?
[01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:39.371]  You're not.
[01:57:39.371 --> 01:57:40.031]  It's exciting.
[01:57:40.031 --> 01:57:40.792]  And that's like, okay.
[01:57:41.543 --> 01:57:48.228]  If anybody thinks that Trump is not the right man for president, think of the influence Trump has had on so many things.
[01:57:48.228 --> 01:57:51.210]  Oh my gosh, it's like gigantic huevos, man.
[01:57:51.210 --> 01:57:55.053]  Oh, you got the Chinese threatening economic sanctions?
[01:57:55.053 --> 01:57:58.956]  Come on, you got the Saudis threatening economic sanctions on the U.S.?
[01:57:58.956 --> 01:58:00.017]  Give us a break.
[01:58:00.017 --> 01:58:02.439]  You haven't even seen a superpower yet, China.
[01:58:02.439 --> 01:58:03.860]  You haven't even seen a superpower.
[01:58:03.860 --> 01:58:05.121]  Yeah, we're being destroyed.
[01:58:05.121 --> 01:58:07.783]  How dare them sit there and bully us and lecture us?
[01:58:08.709 --> 01:58:10.310]  It is pretty crazy, I tell you.
[01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:14.933]  So, it's very exciting to see, like say, you've got people- It shows how arrogant they are, Richard.
[01:58:14.933 --> 01:58:17.495]  I should be mad or you- you're right to be upset.
[01:58:17.495 --> 01:58:23.940]  I mean, folks, are you sick of the biggest mass murderers in history telling us we can't have somebody that says we should have better trade deals?
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:27.162]  That's how broke and whipped they think we are?
[01:58:27.162 --> 01:58:27.782]  Stay there, Richard.
[01:58:27.782 --> 01:58:29.544]  I know you've got a lot to cover.
[01:58:29.544 --> 01:58:31.565]  He was telling me he was going to be in New York today.
[01:58:31.565 --> 01:58:34.968]  I guess he stopped by Cleveland to recon that area.
[01:58:34.968 --> 01:58:38.390]  And by the way, you know wild horses couldn't drag me away from that in July.
[01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.951]  Stay with us.
[01:58:38.951 --> 01:58:41.573]  We're going to be right back in T-minus 70 seconds.
[01:58:41.573 --> 01:58:43.054]  Infowars.com.
[01:58:43.054 --> 01:58:44.054]  Spread that link.
[01:58:44.054 --> 01:58:44.835]  Spread that link.
[01:58:44.835 --> 01:58:45.936]  They don't like that link.
[01:58:45.936 --> 01:58:46.476]  Spread that link.
[01:58:46.476 --> 01:58:47.357]  Have you spread that link today?
[01:58:49.261 --> 01:58:50.081]  Hey, everyone!
[01:58:50.081 --> 01:58:52.362]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:58:52.362 --> 01:58:56.204]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:58:56.204 --> 01:58:58.285]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:58:58.285 --> 01:59:08.569]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:59:08.569 --> 01:59:14.552]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:59:14.952 --> 01:59:15.373]  We're good to go!
[01:59:29.949 --> 01:59:31.050]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:04.416 --> 02:00:16.582]  Well, National Review has been totally discredited.
[02:00:16.582 --> 02:00:20.424]  Two months ago, February 15th, we'll show TV viewers a document cam shot.
[02:00:20.424 --> 02:00:24.105]  It makes perfect sense that Donald Trump is a 9-11 truther.
[02:00:24.105 --> 02:00:25.286]  February 15th, 2016, and the article opens up
[02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:37.963]  In South Carolina on Saturday night, Donald Trump turned into an Alex Jones Show caller.
[02:00:37.963 --> 02:00:43.185]  Saying that Saudi Arabia was involved in 9-11 and that a secret 28 pages showed it.
[02:00:43.185 --> 02:00:45.486]  Well, I mean, that was admitted then and known.
[02:00:45.486 --> 02:00:51.189]  They just hoped their readers were dumb and attacked yours truly.
[02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:54.250]  But Bernie Sanders says he doesn't want to know and isn't going to talk about it.
[02:00:54.250 --> 02:00:55.431]  Isn't he a good little commie?
[02:00:57.484 --> 02:00:58.124]  Unbelievable.
[02:00:58.124 --> 02:01:01.846]  And Hillary says she doesn't know anything about such 28 pages.
[02:01:01.846 --> 02:01:03.706]  Richard, I'm ranting, but go ahead and finish up your points.
[02:01:03.706 --> 02:01:05.927]  I know you're going to be on the Nightly News tonight as well.
[02:01:05.927 --> 02:01:10.769]  You're going to follow a report for Leanne McAdoo, who's hosting, but go ahead, my friend.
[02:01:10.769 --> 02:01:11.289]  Absolutely.
[02:01:11.289 --> 02:01:15.730]  Well, I'll tell you, that piece with Wayne Madsen, you talk about Ted Cruz.
[02:01:15.730 --> 02:01:23.153]  One thing that I noticed, in fact, you know, it didn't come up in y'all's interview, but Ted Cruz ran against David Dewhurst for that Senate seat.
[02:01:23.797 --> 02:01:32.959]  And David Dewhurst was supposed to be the shoe-in for that, so this is all kind of starting to really explain how Ted Cruz was able to really jump up there and be able to beat Dewhurst.
[02:01:32.959 --> 02:01:35.760]  And, by the way, there was a runoff for that race.
[02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:48.583]  Back in 2012, when Ted Cruz ran against Dewhurst, one thing that happened was that, I think, I can't remember how many candidates there were in the primary, but nobody got a majority in the primary, so they had to have a runoff.
[02:01:49.156 --> 02:01:50.817]  And I remember, you know what?
[02:01:50.817 --> 02:01:59.584]  I want to hear Ted Cruz's victory speech the night of the runoff, and so I'm listening to his speech, listening to his speech, and he goes into his thank yous.
[02:01:59.584 --> 02:02:02.647]  Thank you so-and-so, thank you so-and-so, thank you George Bush.
[02:02:02.647 --> 02:02:04.388]  And I'm like, whoa!
[02:02:04.388 --> 02:02:06.090]  Where did that come from?
[02:02:06.090 --> 02:02:07.751]  You know, it's like, wow!
[02:02:07.751 --> 02:02:09.673]  And so, hopefully an InfoWarrior can find that.
[02:02:09.673 --> 02:02:11.014]  I've looked for it on the web.
[02:02:11.014 --> 02:02:17.419]  It's the victory speech that he gave when he won... Ted Cruz's Texas Senate victory speech, I remember it.
[02:02:18.277 --> 02:02:18.677]  I think so.
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.042]  And we encountered this young Chinese man, probably mid-twenties.
[02:02:43.042 --> 02:02:44.322]  He had to be one of the elite.
[02:02:44.322 --> 02:02:46.163]  I mean, he's at a Jeb Bush event, right?
[02:02:46.163 --> 02:02:48.584]  And on the hop of that, he was about six foot four.
[02:02:48.584 --> 02:02:50.805]  He wasn't a regular Chinese man.
[02:02:50.805 --> 02:02:52.826]  And he was like, and I said, where are you from?
[02:02:52.826 --> 02:02:58.629]  He said, he traveled all the way from China to be at a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Jeb Bush event.
[02:02:58.629 --> 02:03:02.190]  So tell me how important Jeb Bush family is to the Chinese.
[02:03:02.190 --> 02:03:03.791]  I mean, we saw Henry Kissinger.
[02:03:03.791 --> 02:03:06.572]  No, it was his dad opened it up and made the whole deal to screw America.
[02:03:07.356 --> 02:03:07.897]  Absolutely.
[02:03:07.897 --> 02:03:11.621]  Henry Kissinger started the crack there for the open door to China.
[02:03:11.621 --> 02:03:14.364]  You know, we know what Henry Kissinger did with Saudi Arabia.
[02:03:14.364 --> 02:03:20.650]  And then, like you said, George Sr., Poppy Bush, really took our industry and started taking it over to China.
[02:03:20.650 --> 02:03:23.033]  And the Bushes are the total enemies of this country.
[02:03:24.042 --> 02:03:24.923]  Absolutely.
[02:03:24.923 --> 02:03:33.988]  And switching gears a little bit, Zika, I haven't really had a chance to totally look into it, and I know there's been so much news, but are the New World Order fingerprints all over Zika, or why?
[02:03:33.988 --> 02:03:34.889]  Yes, they are, Richard.
[02:03:34.889 --> 02:03:35.789]  Incredible.
[02:03:35.789 --> 02:03:37.530]  So that's another brewing story.
[02:03:37.530 --> 02:03:47.917]  Dr. Rockefeller Foundation's souped-up weapon that actually says that from the 50s, and then it's tied into Bill & Melinda Gates, as usual, and these mosquitoes that are being released and quote, mutating magically.
[02:03:48.953 --> 02:03:50.874]  Well, I'm sure there's going to be a lot more reporting on that.
[02:03:50.874 --> 02:03:54.655]  Now, Richard, you've got a ton to cover, so I want to get you on with McAdoo tonight.
[02:03:54.655 --> 02:03:57.996]  You can tape it or be live, but that's a good shot you're there.
[02:03:57.996 --> 02:04:00.076]  I know you've got a lot of other points to cover.
[02:04:00.076 --> 02:04:10.139]  Sorry I got you on to late, but great job and look forward to having you on tomorrow and tomorrow night when we're going to have live extended coverage of the big Republican primary in New York.
[02:04:10.139 --> 02:04:13.180]  Hundreds of delegates up for grabs tomorrow, one of the most important dates.
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:20.776]  And they're on Fox News saying even if he wins, they may be bold enough to try to take delegates in New York and announce Cruz the winner even if Trump wins there.
[02:04:20.776 --> 02:04:23.061]  I mean, they are some arrogant, arrogant people, Richard.
[02:04:24.062 --> 02:04:32.608]  Yes, sir, and I'll tell you what, it's absolutely an honor and a privilege to get pushed back with Wayne Madsen doing an earth-shattering report with you and Alex.
[02:04:32.608 --> 02:04:33.609]  It's incredible.
[02:04:33.609 --> 02:04:34.730]  It was, I'll tell you.
[02:04:34.730 --> 02:04:36.471]  You were there at the start of 9-11 Truth, Richard.
[02:04:36.471 --> 02:04:40.014]  I've known you since 2002, and they are just flipping out right now.
[02:04:40.014 --> 02:04:41.195]  Richard Reeves on the road.
[02:04:41.195 --> 02:04:44.717]  Our great political correspondents will be back with us tomorrow and on the Nightly News.
[02:04:44.717 --> 02:04:45.258]  Thank you, Richard.
[02:04:46.804 --> 02:04:48.186]  Alright folks, we're going to be back.
[02:04:48.186 --> 02:04:49.268]  He's getting suited up.
[02:04:49.268 --> 02:04:55.397]  We're going to have Ron Paul, former chief of staff, head of the Von Mise Institute, one of the top libertarians globally.
[02:04:55.397 --> 02:04:56.919]  Lou Rockwell on the Big Fix 2016.
[02:04:59.358 --> 02:05:06.842]  Nearly 40 volcanoes are currently erupting across the world, and scientists warn that the current conditions could trigger at least four record-breaking earthquakes.
[02:05:06.842 --> 02:05:14.425]  The earthquakes that just hit recently have left over 270 dead in Ecuador and over 42 dead in Japan, with mass evacuations continuing out of fear of aftershocks.
[02:05:14.425 --> 02:05:23.209]  And scientists at Tokyo University estimate there's at least a 70% chance that Japan will eventually suffer from another earthquake equivalent to the Great Kanto of 1923, which measured 8.9 and killed over 142,000 people.
[02:05:26.431 --> 02:05:33.519]  And other scientists also fear a full-blown eruption of the Yellowstone National Park volcano, which could have up to 2,000 times the power of the Mount St.
[02:05:33.519 --> 02:05:34.360]  Helens eruption of 1980.
[02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:42.689]  Some even speculate that the volcanic winter resulting from a Yellowstone eruption could devastate America's food supply and could even cool the planet 20 degrees.
[02:05:42.689 --> 02:05:45.773]  The volcanic ash could even blanket areas a thousand miles away.
[02:05:45.973 --> 02:05:47.994]  There's already signs an eruption could happen.
[02:05:47.994 --> 02:05:50.855]  A few weeks ago, a river near the Super Volcano started to boil.
[02:05:50.855 --> 02:05:53.916]  And the volcano itself is blasting out even more steam than before.
[02:05:53.916 --> 02:05:57.598]  For more news, visit InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:05:57.598 --> 02:05:59.278]  This is Kit Annals reporting.
[02:05:59.278 --> 02:06:09.802]  You're investing in your health and supporting the InfoWar when you visit InfoWarsLife.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 Nason Iodine and all the great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:06:09.802 --> 02:06:11.223]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists,
[02:06:11.403 --> 02:06:15.728]  Chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[02:06:15.728 --> 02:06:22.956]  Iodine is key, is paramount, and there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[02:06:22.956 --> 02:06:31.686]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[02:06:31.886 --> 02:06:35.789]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[02:06:35.789 --> 02:06:38.611]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[02:06:38.611 --> 02:06:51.540]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of Survival Shield nascent iodine, that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[02:06:51.540 --> 02:06:58.485]  It is exclusive to InfoWarsLife.com and the InfoWarsLife family of incredible products.
[02:06:59.105 --> 02:07:02.927]  Anthony Gucciardi here with an InfoWars health news update with Alex Jones.
[02:07:02.927 --> 02:07:03.868]  That's right, Anthony.
[02:07:03.868 --> 02:07:06.829]  One of our top-selling products is BrainForce.
[02:07:06.829 --> 02:07:11.132]  It is very affordably priced at retail that we normally discount it.
[02:07:11.132 --> 02:07:20.797]  We've discounted from the discount 25%, but if you count it from its regular price, that's 45% discount for a limited time at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:07:20.797 --> 02:07:26.620]  There are a lot of brain boosters out there, or what's known as nootropics, but here's what separates BrainForce from the rest.
[02:07:26.900 --> 02:07:38.708]  Unlike some energy drinks and supplements, Brain Force uses natural brain activation ingredients like Yerba Mate Extract, Alpha-GPC, L-Theanine, Hyperzine A, Phosphatidylserine, B12, and many others.
[02:07:38.708 --> 02:07:44.112]  Major nutraceutical review sites rave about this formulation, and they also rave about the price.

[02:08:25.723 --> 02:08:34.786]  Ladies and gentlemen, the next hour, Lou Rockwell of lourockwell.com and the head of the Von Mies Institute will be our guest.
[02:08:34.786 --> 02:08:38.887]  I intend the last 20 minutes or so to open the phones up and take your questions or comments.
[02:08:38.887 --> 02:08:40.188]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:08:40.188 --> 02:08:40.328]  800-259-9231.
[02:08:40.328 --> 02:08:41.708]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:08:41.708 --> 02:08:43.549]  Infowars.com is obviously our main site.
[02:08:52.685 --> 02:08:53.866]  Wow, where to begin?
[02:08:53.866 --> 02:08:57.908]  We now see America under global governance to a great extent.
[02:08:57.908 --> 02:09:00.130]  Secret trade deals signed.
[02:09:00.130 --> 02:09:08.475]  We see elections being openly cancelled all over the country and Ted Cruz calling it a grassroots victory.
[02:09:08.475 --> 02:09:14.979]  Are we seeing the death throes of the out-of-control political class or are we seeing their complete takeover and a victory?
[02:09:16.983 --> 02:09:25.949]  I think it's up to us to decide that, but if you go back to two months ago, quote, it makes perfect sense that Donald Trump is a 9-11 truther, February 15th.
[02:09:25.949 --> 02:09:33.935]  And then you go to the article, in South Carolina on Saturday night, Donald Trump turned into an Alex Jones show caller.
[02:09:33.935 --> 02:09:38.838]  And what they always do is misrepresent what we've said.
[02:09:38.838 --> 02:09:41.420]  Saudi Arabia had 15 of the 19 hijackers.
[02:09:41.420 --> 02:09:45.723]  I talked to the FBI agents, the translators, the whistleblowers, I interviewed them all.
[02:09:46.618 --> 02:09:51.723]  They were ordered to stand down before, on, and after by criminal elements in our government.
[02:09:51.723 --> 02:09:54.386]  The media spun it that I was saying there wasn't any radical Islam.
[02:09:54.386 --> 02:09:55.427]  Of course there is.
[02:09:55.427 --> 02:09:58.570]  We stand firmly against it.
[02:09:58.570 --> 02:10:05.977]  Cirque du Soleil is cancelling coming to different states that pass laws protecting Christians' free speech.
[02:10:05.977 --> 02:10:10.522]  But they're going to go to countries in the Middle East that chop gay people's heads off.
[02:10:12.025 --> 02:10:27.386]  While the left pushes for massive censorship across America and calls Donald Trump Hitler, while the Communist Chinese under Mao, that killed over 84 million people according to them, lecture us.
[02:10:27.386 --> 02:10:29.589]  If anybody's close to Hitler, it's the Communist Chinese.
[02:10:32.315 --> 02:10:39.717]  And the reason I open up with the fact that it's in the Associated Press, it's in the New York Times, it's in the New York Post.
[02:10:39.717 --> 02:10:41.758]  Look at these headlines.
[02:10:41.758 --> 02:10:44.639]  Headlines, that's a new term I have for it.
[02:10:44.639 --> 02:10:47.940]  But what happens when they start telling the truth?
[02:10:47.940 --> 02:10:51.041]  What happens when they're forced to get it out in the open?
[02:10:51.041 --> 02:10:53.042]  This is the collapse of the facade.
[02:10:55.805 --> 02:10:59.286]  Saudi Arabia threatens to pull $750 billion from the U.S.
[02:10:59.286 --> 02:11:03.527]  economy if Congress allows them to be sued for 9-11 terror attacks.
[02:11:03.527 --> 02:11:05.027]  Here's another headline, New York Post.
[02:11:05.027 --> 02:11:05.588]  How U.S.
[02:11:05.588 --> 02:11:08.948]  covered up Saudi role in 9-11.
[02:11:08.948 --> 02:11:13.330]  Saudi Arabia warns of economic fallout if Congress praises 9-11 bill.
[02:11:13.330 --> 02:11:14.450]  Passes it.
[02:11:14.450 --> 02:11:17.191]  Saudi Arabia warns of economic fallout.
[02:11:17.191 --> 02:11:22.112]  These are the threats of a hereditary dictatorship like North Korea.
[02:11:23.766 --> 02:11:37.497]  Who got their power from British intelligence in 1901, they controlled about 200 square miles along a key caravan route where they would rob people, including capturing women and children to be used as sex slaves.
[02:11:37.497 --> 02:11:43.602]  If anybody is bad, it's not Donald Trump, it's Saudi Arabia and the Communist Chinese leadership.
[02:11:45.427 --> 02:11:51.668]  And the reason I preface this with all that is I wanted to get Lew Rockwell on for a few weeks, he's a busy guy, about the election theft.
[02:11:51.668 --> 02:11:52.848]  We're going to cover that.
[02:11:52.848 --> 02:11:54.649]  Look at this Daily Mail headline.
[02:11:54.649 --> 02:12:03.270]  Cruz claims he's won landslides over and over, beating Trump in five consecutive states, even though only one of them had an election.
[02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:11.952]  And then in other states, like Louisiana, Tennessee, Arizona, Georgia, Trump wins
[02:12:13.396 --> 02:12:20.258]  And then they just give the delegates, before they even go to the convention, to Cruz.
[02:12:20.258 --> 02:12:32.463]  And the reason I want to get Lew Rockwell on, he helped get Ron Paul in Congress, he's worked in Congress, he was the chief of staff, before he went on to be the best-selling author and head of the Von Mies Institute, and the rest of it, and then found the popular news site LewRockwell.com.
[02:12:33.493 --> 02:12:39.576]  As a political expert, elections expert, what his view is on all of this and where he sees this going.
[02:12:39.576 --> 02:12:40.577]  And I want to ask him again.
[02:12:40.577 --> 02:12:44.399]  I have some major issues with Donald Trump, just like Ron Paul does.
[02:12:44.399 --> 02:12:48.741]  But the fact that they're so scared of him and that he is a nationalist.
[02:12:50.017 --> 02:12:54.118]  It's why I'm supporting him, because at this point I'm just supporting open elections.
[02:12:54.118 --> 02:12:59.759]  Lew Rockwell, am I wrong in saying this is one of the most epic times in the history of the United States?
[02:12:59.759 --> 02:13:05.621]  I mean, it has a 1776 feel to it, or am I wrong?
[02:13:05.621 --> 02:13:10.922]  Are we at that crossroads that you and Ron Paul have warned about for 30 years?
[02:13:10.922 --> 02:13:12.322]  Well, Alex, I certainly hope so.
[02:13:12.322 --> 02:13:17.563]  I mean, I think we definitely need an ideological and a moral upheaval in this country.
[02:13:17.563 --> 02:13:19.484]  And it's why the regime
[02:13:20.327 --> 02:13:34.475]  The neocons, the Republican establishment, the Democratic establishment, the academic establishment, the corporate establishment, bankers and all these people fear populism because it riles up the people.
[02:13:34.475 --> 02:13:37.017]  It says, you know what, you're being ripped off.
[02:13:37.717 --> 02:13:49.461]  Not only are they bad ideologically, they're stealing from you, they're ripping you off, they're taking your freedom, they're taking your money, and they're all living very well thanks to it.
[02:13:49.461 --> 02:14:01.646]  So Trump has the ability to really connect to people, and like you and Ron, I have many differences with Mr. Trump on the issues, although I think we're... but all these guys are bad on trade from my standpoint.
[02:14:01.926 --> 02:14:04.868]  They're all bad on all the issues that Trump is bad on.
[02:14:04.868 --> 02:14:06.129]  They're all bad on.
[02:14:06.129 --> 02:14:22.320]  On the other hand, the places where Trump is good, whether it's immigration or the political correctness movement or the especially foreign policy questions of war and peace, he's uniquely different and better than the others.
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:23.201]  Is he for real?
[02:14:23.201 --> 02:14:29.165]  You know, after so many years of watching this stuff, I'm sure you forgive me if I'm not 100% sure.
[02:14:30.706 --> 02:14:36.390]  But I think he's stirring up just tremendous outrage among the American people.
[02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:38.051]  Tapping into that outrage.
[02:14:38.051 --> 02:14:40.132]  We've seen it even in the polls.
[02:14:40.132 --> 02:14:42.514]  People are more and more distrust the government.
[02:14:42.514 --> 02:14:44.235]  They distrust the big media.
[02:14:44.235 --> 02:14:46.256]  They know there are things that are desperately wrong.
[02:14:46.256 --> 02:14:47.757]  They fear for themselves.
[02:14:47.757 --> 02:14:50.119]  They fear for their children and their grandchildren.
[02:14:50.119 --> 02:14:52.400]  They just are very worried about what's happening in this country.
[02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:55.962]  They all know this is not the same America they grew up in.
[02:14:55.962 --> 02:14:57.563]  And they don't like it.
[02:14:57.563 --> 02:14:59.565]  So Trump is stirring everybody up.
[02:15:01.001 --> 02:15:02.362]  You know, we'll see what happens.
[02:15:02.362 --> 02:15:12.285]  I should just mention, by the way, the Mises Institute is not a political or a partisan organization, so I'm simply giving my own views when I talk about some of these things about Trump and all.
[02:15:12.285 --> 02:15:14.666]  Sure, you guys promote Austrian economics.
[02:15:14.666 --> 02:15:17.367]  Yes, and libertarianism.
[02:15:17.367 --> 02:15:23.149]  But I will say that I think Trump is doing a whole lot of good.
[02:15:23.149 --> 02:15:24.370]  He's scaring
[02:15:25.097 --> 02:15:25.978]  Everybody evil.
[02:15:25.978 --> 02:15:48.709]  I mean if you look at the people who really hate the guys of Trump It's like a who's who of the creeps of the country So that has to tell us something and he's just much better on foreign policy when we're facing people I think probably Hillary is the worst the most likely to start a World War three Cruz is probably not far away from her We were facing people like that Trump
[02:15:49.639 --> 02:15:52.541]  I think he's the least likely to start a war.
[02:15:52.541 --> 02:15:53.621]  I think that's the best thing.
[02:15:53.621 --> 02:15:55.783]  He doesn't want to just randomly start a war with Russia.
[02:15:55.783 --> 02:15:56.843]  They have two bases.
[02:15:56.843 --> 02:15:58.144]  They're doing nothing to us.
[02:15:58.144 --> 02:16:00.105]  We're funding ISIS against them.
[02:16:00.105 --> 02:16:06.209]  And that's what I like best is the fact that he wants us to be strong, to be able to defend ourselves, but says we're not just going to go around attacking people.
[02:16:06.209 --> 02:16:09.511]  And listen, I do the same calculus you engage in, Lou.
[02:16:09.511 --> 02:16:10.572]  I look at him and I say, look,
[02:16:11.477 --> 02:16:37.395]  I don't just trust somebody off their rhetoric, but when I see true, palpable fear, hundreds and hundreds of millions thrown against him by the Republican and Democratic establishment, the stealing of the election, they're so desperate, openly, desperately, the Chinese Communists, the Socialist Pope, the Mexican presidents and former presidents and Hollywood and the kitchen sink, I've been told by high-level Trump people, and I'm just going to leave it at that,
[02:16:38.399 --> 02:16:47.162]  That he really is a closet libertarian, a closet anti-New World Order guy, and more and more he comes out against Saudi Arabia, he comes out against China.
[02:16:47.162 --> 02:16:49.283]  I mean, I really think it's true.
[02:16:49.283 --> 02:16:50.324]  More and more.
[02:16:50.324 --> 02:16:52.604]  And so I think that's why they're so scared.
[02:16:52.604 --> 02:16:53.565]  He comes out against NATO.
[02:16:54.626 --> 02:16:57.909]  Yes, why should we have all these bases all over the world?
[02:16:57.909 --> 02:16:59.510]  If you look at a map of U.S.
[02:16:59.510 --> 02:17:01.812]  bases, they surround Russia.
[02:17:01.812 --> 02:17:04.795]  There aren't any Russian bases surrounding the U.S.
[02:17:04.795 --> 02:17:05.175]  The U.S.
[02:17:05.175 --> 02:17:11.361]  feels perfectly fine to send destroyers armed with who knows what kinds of weapons very close to St.
[02:17:11.361 --> 02:17:11.681]  Petersburg.
[02:17:12.902 --> 02:17:16.145]  Can you imagine if there were 50 Russian ships around the US?
[02:17:16.145 --> 02:17:17.787]  I'd be calling for blowing them up.
[02:17:29.878 --> 02:17:35.765]  So, you know, the U.S., of course, as we're told by all the neocons and all the creeps, is the exceptional nation.
[02:17:35.765 --> 02:17:44.155]  The rules that apply to everybody else don't apply to the U.S., just like they would argue that the rules that apply to all the other human beings... Where does this arrogance come from?
[02:17:45.697 --> 02:17:48.059]  Well, you know, I think it has something to do with government.
[02:17:48.059 --> 02:17:54.765]  You know, if you go... I don't like to go to Washington, but one of the things that always strikes me about Washington is the level of arrogance.
[02:17:54.765 --> 02:17:57.207]  I mean, these people even walk arrogantly.
[02:17:57.207 --> 02:17:58.648]  They talk arrogantly.
[02:17:58.648 --> 02:18:03.512]  They all think of themselves as being at the center of the empire, and therefore they're very, very important.
[02:18:03.512 --> 02:18:05.173]  Of course, they're not important.
[02:18:05.173 --> 02:18:06.655]  But the U.S.
[02:18:06.655 --> 02:18:09.957]  feels it should rule the world, the solar system, you know, whatever.
[02:18:09.957 --> 02:18:12.279]  They believe their history is accurate to quote Karl Rove.
[02:18:13.180 --> 02:18:24.103]  Well, they believe, you know, is it any different from the Roman Empire, or the Babylonians, or the Egyptians, or the British, or all these empires in the history of the world have this kind of arrogance.
[02:18:24.103 --> 02:18:26.503]  Everybody else is just dirt under their feet.
[02:18:26.503 --> 02:18:28.544]  Their boots should be under their throat.
[02:18:28.544 --> 02:18:34.045]  And of course, most of all, they concentrate on the people they fear the most, which is not foreigners, it's Americans.
[02:18:34.045 --> 02:18:37.446]  So they're worried about Americans tossing off the yoke.
[02:18:37.446 --> 02:18:41.707]  And so when they see something like what's happening with Trump, it's why they're so desperate
[02:18:42.287 --> 02:18:55.976]  I'm afraid they may be successful, but it's why they're so desperate to deny him the nomination, why they're willing to be openly rip off, these rip off festivals in Colorado and elsewhere, where they're going to take his delegates.
[02:18:55.976 --> 02:19:00.880]  Very few, maybe a half of the Trump delegates will actually be Trump supporters.
[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:05.343]  Maybe a half of them will be, will be like double agents.
[02:19:05.343 --> 02:19:10.947]  So if they can deny him the nomination on the first ballot, and that's of course what they're working very hard to do.
[02:19:12.047 --> 02:19:14.168]  I think he's not going to get it.
[02:19:14.168 --> 02:19:20.991]  Probably it's going to be Cruz or, you know, I don't think they can actually get away with bringing Paul Ryan in.
[02:19:20.991 --> 02:19:22.312]  Lou, I want to get into that.
[02:19:22.312 --> 02:19:27.354]  I want to get into that with Lou Rockwell of lourockwell.com speaking to us today from the Mises Institute.
[02:19:27.354 --> 02:19:36.218]  Mises.org, key information obviously there on economics and libertarianism and true free market through the dollar, you know, through voting with our decisions.
[02:19:37.543 --> 02:19:42.406]  But getting back to what you mentioned, you will know someone by their friends and their enemies.
[02:19:42.406 --> 02:19:51.491]  I've never seen such a laundry list, and I'm kind of ashamed of Americans, and that there's not even more support for Trump when the whole world's bossing us around.
[02:19:51.491 --> 02:20:00.476]  I mean, this is really pathetic, like we're some colonialized, controlled nation run by multinationals, but I guess that's what it's come down to.
[02:20:01.513 --> 02:20:20.625]  You know, I hark back to one of the seconders for Grover Cleveland's second nomination for president, and the man nominating him talked about how great Cleveland's first term had been, and it would be so wonderful, his second term, how he was great in so many ways, but then he said, you know, we love him most for the enemies he has made.
[02:20:21.587 --> 02:20:26.249]  So, I mean, it does say something about a man, who his enemies are, who hates him.
[02:20:26.249 --> 02:20:31.491]  And in Trump's case, I mean, it's definitely a rogues gallery.
[02:20:31.491 --> 02:20:35.853]  It's like a, you know, one of those books in the police station with all the photos of the criminals.
[02:20:35.853 --> 02:20:40.315]  That's what, you know, the book of the anti-Trumpians, that's what it would look like.
[02:20:40.315 --> 02:20:43.256]  And you should have them facing front and facing to the side.
[02:20:44.777 --> 02:20:47.038]  These are very bad people.
[02:20:47.038 --> 02:20:48.039]  George Soros.
[02:20:48.039 --> 02:20:59.567]  I mean, you know, we can go down the list of all the people who have dedicated their billions to destroying this country, to changing things radically in the worst kind of a way.
[02:20:59.567 --> 02:21:04.611]  These are people who, you know, in some sense, there are aspects of communism they want to bring here.
[02:21:04.611 --> 02:21:08.574]  We already have some aspects of communism with the Fed and other government programs.
[02:21:09.114 --> 02:21:10.635]  They'd like to make it worse.
[02:21:10.635 --> 02:21:17.819]  They want to, of course, inundate us with welfare immigrants and all the rest of the all the rest of the horrible things they're doing.
[02:21:17.819 --> 02:21:19.960]  Let's talk about their plan, Lee Rockwell.
[02:21:19.960 --> 02:21:20.981]  Yes, sir.
[02:21:20.981 --> 02:21:23.582]  But first, getting back into the election since you mentioned it.
[02:21:23.582 --> 02:21:25.023]  You've been Chief of Staff for Ron Paul.
[02:21:25.023 --> 02:21:27.765]  You've run congressional campaigns successfully.
[02:21:27.765 --> 02:21:30.426]  Have you ever seen a steal this blatant?
[02:21:30.426 --> 02:21:31.927]  And what do you expect to see next?
[02:21:31.927 --> 02:21:33.408]  I mean, your expert view on the election.
[02:21:34.048 --> 02:21:52.540]  Well, I wasn't there to see it, but the 52 Republican convention, chaired by Earl Warren, stole the nomination from Bob Taft, who was sort of the Ron Paul of his day, great man, and gave it to Dwight Eisenhower, who was the establishment candidate, the Rockefeller candidate.
[02:21:53.841 --> 02:22:02.607]  Murray Rothbard always said if only Robert Welch had referred to Eisenhower as a conscious, dedicated agent of the Rockefeller conspiracy, he would have been exactly right.
[02:22:02.607 --> 02:22:15.917]  So what they did was they threw out elected TAF delegates and installed in the convention Eisenhower delegates in various states to give Eisenhower the nomination.
[02:22:15.917 --> 02:22:17.758]  But there was no social media in those days.
[02:22:17.758 --> 02:22:20.820]  It was just the establishment press who were all, of course, cheering for Ike.
[02:22:23.482 --> 02:22:24.563]  They got away with it then.
[02:22:24.563 --> 02:22:27.764]  I don't think they're going to get away with it this time.
[02:22:27.764 --> 02:22:34.967]  They may get away with giving the nomination to the creep of the moment, but I think they're not going to get away with it with the American people.
[02:22:34.967 --> 02:22:40.490]  I think this means, and I would love to see it, got my fingers crossed, the demolition of the Republican Party.
[02:22:40.490 --> 02:22:45.912]  I come out of the Republican Party before going straight, and I'd love to see them go down.
[02:22:45.912 --> 02:22:47.793]  They really are a rotten organization.
[02:22:47.793 --> 02:22:49.714]  Yes, there are good people who are Republicans,
[02:22:50.254 --> 02:23:06.044]  But the establishment of the party in the states, in the National Party, in the Senate, in the Congress, in the various bureaucracies, these are evil people, these are awful people, and to see their little game taken away, how sweet it would be.
[02:23:06.044 --> 02:23:07.865]  Lew Rockwell's our guest.
[02:23:07.865 --> 02:23:17.151]  Separately, I want to get back into the campaign and back into other big issues that are on your radar, but the economy, the big bubble, the big event that you've talked about so long,
[02:23:18.211 --> 02:23:21.175]  The Federal Reserve saying we're gonna, you know, just go back to zero interest rates.
[02:23:21.175 --> 02:23:23.298]  The IMF, the World Bank.
[02:23:23.298 --> 02:23:24.800]  Trump's talking about the big bubble.
[02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:26.722]  China's imploding.
[02:23:26.722 --> 02:23:29.145]  You really are, first and foremost, an economic expert.
[02:23:29.145 --> 02:23:32.570]  What are the other experts at the Mises Institute saying about what's happening?
[02:23:33.404 --> 02:23:42.488]  Well, first of all, another thing they've attacked Trump for is saying there is a bubble, and he thinks it's a very dangerous bubble, and he fears that it's going to pop.
[02:23:42.488 --> 02:23:43.689]  And, of course, he's exactly right.
[02:23:43.689 --> 02:23:56.914]  There is a huge bubble that's been pumped up by the Fed in order to reward Wall Street, in order to make stocks go up, in order to make Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and all the rest of these firms even richer than they are.
[02:23:56.914 --> 02:23:59.836]  So that's been the deliberate policy.
[02:23:59.836 --> 02:24:02.197]  Now, of course, we're going to have negative interest rates.
[02:24:03.177 --> 02:24:11.087]  Zero interest rates, it's already unnatural and unbelievably economically destructive to have the Fed holding interest rates near zero.
[02:24:11.087 --> 02:24:17.135]  But of course they're going to bring them below zero, same time they want to outlaw cash.
[02:24:17.135 --> 02:24:21.321]  Because one of the problems for them with zero interest rates, or even negative interest rates,
[02:24:22.222 --> 02:24:27.244]  People think then, why should I, heck, should I keep my money in the bank when they're charging me a fee?
[02:24:27.244 --> 02:24:31.006]  Much better to take it out and either keep it just in cash or buy gold.
[02:24:31.006 --> 02:24:34.608]  So in order to prevent that from happening, they want to outlaw cash.
[02:24:34.608 --> 02:24:44.293]  They do not want you to be able to, you can transfer your money from bank A to bank B, of course they're okay with that, but you are not going to be allowed to take your money out in the form of cash.
[02:24:44.293 --> 02:24:45.513]  This is what they'd like.
[02:24:45.513 --> 02:24:46.594]  So they're talking about
[02:24:47.054 --> 02:24:51.779]  What politically correct person is going to be on which dollar bill, which 20 or the 10 or whatever.
[02:24:51.779 --> 02:24:54.941]  Of course, I must say, I think they're all pretty awful.
[02:24:54.941 --> 02:24:57.164]  If you get on one of the U.S.
[02:24:57.164 --> 02:24:58.905]  notes, you're pretty awful.
[02:24:58.905 --> 02:25:03.169]  The late Bert Blumberg used to hark back to the days when U.S.
[02:25:03.169 --> 02:25:10.336]  coins and notes had no politicians on them, but had Lady Liberty or American Indian or Buffalo or things like that.
[02:25:10.336 --> 02:25:10.916]  And he said that
[02:25:11.977 --> 02:25:21.045]  You know things have taken a bad step when they started to put politicians on the money, although you said the actual worst step when you really need to watch out is when they put living politicians on the money.
[02:25:21.045 --> 02:25:22.326]  And that's not happening.
[02:25:22.326 --> 02:25:25.969]  Not quite there, but is there going to be an Obama $10 bill at some point?
[02:25:25.969 --> 02:25:28.111]  I don't think we can rule it out.
[02:25:28.111 --> 02:25:30.252]  These people are so arrogant, so crazy.
[02:25:30.252 --> 02:25:33.735]  We'll be right back to Caesar, and that's what scares me.
[02:25:33.735 --> 02:25:37.759]  They have all these advanced weapons, they're totally arrogant, everything they're doing now
[02:25:38.399 --> 02:25:41.281]  Basically falls on its face, but they don't care.
[02:25:41.281 --> 02:25:42.322]  They just move forward.
[02:25:42.322 --> 02:25:47.886]  Speaking of that, how big a deal is it to see all the big newspapers talking about U.S.
[02:25:47.886 --> 02:25:50.128]  government stood down on 9-11, U.S.
[02:25:50.128 --> 02:25:52.229]  government covered up for Saudis?
[02:25:52.229 --> 02:25:54.932]  That has got to really scare the power structure.
[02:25:55.652 --> 02:25:57.394]  Well, I think it's great.
[02:25:57.394 --> 02:26:02.559]  Of course, those 28... First of all, the whole 9-11 report is, shall I put this, highly flawed.
[02:26:02.559 --> 02:26:08.405]  As Ron Paul and you've said, we need an honest investigation of those events.
[02:26:08.405 --> 02:26:08.785]  But the...
[02:26:09.465 --> 02:26:11.968]  You know, of course it all should be published.
[02:26:11.968 --> 02:26:16.253]  And the Saudis are a very corrupt and rotten regime.
[02:26:16.253 --> 02:26:19.477]  They are allowed to get away with all kinds of things that nobody else is.
[02:26:19.477 --> 02:26:23.862]  Because, I don't want to shock anybody, they pay off American politicians.
[02:26:23.862 --> 02:26:29.188]  There's huge money involved if you go over there and kiss their hand, hold their hand like the George H. Bush
[02:26:29.787 --> 02:26:30.768]  George H.W.
[02:26:30.768 --> 02:26:32.429]  Bush and George W. Bush used to do.
[02:26:32.429 --> 02:26:36.894]  Obama saluting and bowing to them and so forth.
[02:26:36.894 --> 02:26:38.775]  He's getting the big bucks in return.
[02:26:38.775 --> 02:26:40.116]  Maybe when he's in office.
[02:26:40.116 --> 02:26:41.958]  Maybe it's when he's out of office.
[02:26:41.958 --> 02:26:44.560]  But they have a lot of money to hand around in Washington.
[02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:46.542]  Got a lot of people on the payroll.
[02:26:46.542 --> 02:26:47.923]  So if this actually happens...
[02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:53.322]  No, I think it's a great thing, and I hope it will encourage more interest in this.
[02:26:53.322 --> 02:27:09.807]  I was thrilled to see that, you know, Wayne Madsen is questioning whether Rafael Cruz, Ted Cruz's father, might have had some very shady connections back in the days of the anti-Cuban exiles involved with the CIA and the Kennedy assassination.
[02:27:09.807 --> 02:27:14.549]  So maybe Cruz's ties to the regime go much deeper than any of us have thought.
[02:27:14.549 --> 02:27:17.510]  I mean, we've always known, as Roger Stone points out, he's a Bush Republican.
[02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:18.030]  Sure.
[02:27:18.030 --> 02:27:18.110]  Sure.
[02:27:47.970 --> 02:27:49.773]  So that's very, very important.
[02:27:49.773 --> 02:28:01.012]  But also the negative interest rates, the banks getting shakier and shakier, the dollar getting shakier, the whole world empire of finance getting shakier.
[02:28:01.954 --> 02:28:08.798]  This is, there's, you know, there's real trouble ahead on that, on that, on that, and of course they've continued to build the police state here at home.
[02:28:08.798 --> 02:28:12.660]  I mean, these are really a very bad bunch of people.
[02:28:12.660 --> 02:28:12.900]  U.S.
[02:28:12.900 --> 02:28:18.223]  government, the biggest, richest, most powerful government in the history of the world by many magnitudes.
[02:28:18.223 --> 02:28:20.524]  Forget Stalin or whatever.
[02:28:20.524 --> 02:28:23.066]  Stalin didn't try to tell you the size of your toilet tank.
[02:28:23.706 --> 02:28:25.908]  So we, you have, the U.S.
[02:28:25.908 --> 02:28:28.531]  is a soft... Or not to use the word mother or father.
[02:28:28.531 --> 02:28:33.135]  In public schools across the country, on the literature, when you enroll your kids, don't use mother or father.
[02:28:33.135 --> 02:28:34.176]  That's offensive.
[02:28:34.176 --> 02:28:35.477]  Well, that would be bigoted, Alex.
[02:28:35.477 --> 02:28:36.538]  You know that.
[02:28:36.538 --> 02:28:44.086]  So, no, these people are, you know, just unbelievable at the whole SJW business, which is like the official
[02:28:44.830 --> 02:28:50.463]  The official part of the regime, again, not saying mother and father might hurt somebody's feelings.
[02:28:50.463 --> 02:28:52.388]  Can't say male or female.
[02:28:52.388 --> 02:28:54.232]  You can't say his or hers.
[02:28:55.359 --> 02:28:56.661]  I mean, yes.
[02:28:56.661 --> 02:29:00.265]  I do think there's huge opposition to it, even though it's suppressed.
[02:29:00.265 --> 02:29:04.951]  I think Trump is calling on this opposition, he's helping stir it up, rise it up.
[02:29:04.951 --> 02:29:09.356]  You know, people get courage when they see somebody else speaking out.
[02:29:09.356 --> 02:29:12.139]  They know what he's saying is true.
[02:29:12.139 --> 02:29:13.161]  This is true for Ron Paul.
[02:29:13.161 --> 02:29:13.661]  That's right.
[02:29:13.661 --> 02:29:14.602]  He's a bellwether.
[02:29:15.223 --> 02:29:17.386]  He's a bellwether on populism rising.
[02:29:17.386 --> 02:29:23.034]  I want to ask you what you would do in the economy, what a Von Mies Institute view is on that.
[02:29:23.034 --> 02:29:24.415]  I want to go to some phone calls.
[02:29:24.415 --> 02:29:27.499]  I want to talk about political correctness as well, not just here but in Europe.
[02:29:27.499 --> 02:29:28.881]  This true totalitarianism...
[02:29:29.878 --> 02:29:33.780]  Where they're wanting to arrest filmmakers or people that criticize radical Islam.
[02:29:33.780 --> 02:29:35.201]  I mean, it's happening in Europe.
[02:29:35.201 --> 02:29:36.202]  They're trying to bring it here.
[02:29:36.202 --> 02:29:37.403]  Lou Rockwell's our guest.
[02:29:37.403 --> 02:29:38.904]  LouRockwell.com.
[02:29:38.904 --> 02:29:39.784]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:39.784 --> 02:29:40.705]  Infowars.com.
[02:29:40.705 --> 02:29:42.646]  We're going to cover a bunch of news with him.
[02:29:42.646 --> 02:29:44.767]  Straight ahead and take your phone calls.
[02:29:44.767 --> 02:29:48.730]  And then, Paul Watson hosts the 4th Hour from London, England.
[02:29:48.730 --> 02:29:50.131]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.131 --> 02:29:52.652]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.652 --> 02:29:55.354]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.491 --> 02:30:02.234]  Today is Monday, April 18th, and here's some of the latest news.
[02:30:02.234 --> 02:30:06.678]  It's now known that the Colorado lawmakers who voted to scrap the state primary are in fact Ted Cruz delegates.
[02:30:06.678 --> 02:30:11.643]  Four state Republicans voted against a bill that would allow Colorado voters a chance to vote in a presidential primary.
[02:30:11.643 --> 02:30:16.048]  And all of them are Cruz supporters, with three of them listed as members of Cruz's Colorado leadership team.
[02:30:16.428 --> 02:30:23.992]  And one of them, Senator Kevin Grantham, even had the audacity to brag about Cruz's quote victory on Twitter despite the fact that the voters did not get to pick a candidate.
[02:30:23.992 --> 02:30:31.656]  In other news, only 6% of people trust the mainstream media, putting the industry about equal to Congress and well below the public's view of other organizations.
[02:30:31.656 --> 02:30:36.478]  This lack of confidence in establishment media is fueled by inaccuracies in reporting and deceptive bias.
[02:30:36.798 --> 02:30:46.147]  Another study revealed that only 45% of Americans, over 77 million, will not pay an income tax this year because they have no taxable income or they receive enough tax breaks to raise their liability.
[02:30:46.147 --> 02:30:48.750]  This says a lot about the current decline of the economy.
[02:30:48.750 --> 02:30:54.596]  You'd expect less tax revenue as more Americans leave the job market or stay underemployed at part-time jobs.

[02:30:59.458 --> 02:31:03.419]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:31:03.419 --> 02:31:09.742]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:31:09.742 --> 02:31:17.004]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.

[02:31:32.290 --> 02:31:37.132]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:31:37.132 --> 02:31:40.714]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:31:40.714 --> 02:31:42.615]  No needles, no injections.
[02:31:42.615 --> 02:31:44.255]  Don't take my word for it.

[02:33:00.171 --> 02:33:07.573]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:33:29.548 --> 02:33:30.882]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen...
[02:33:32.555 --> 02:33:48.467]  Every day I have, no exaggeration, probably 15 articles that I don't even cover one of sometimes, where they are trying to arrest filmmakers in America, trying to shut down talk radio, openly in newspapers calling for, you know, the time has come to shut down Alex Jones.
[02:33:48.467 --> 02:33:49.188]  He's a criminal.
[02:33:49.188 --> 02:33:50.349]  He wants violence.
[02:33:50.349 --> 02:33:52.531]  They lie incessantly.
[02:33:52.531 --> 02:33:59.316]  Remember Glenn Beck when he said, Ron Paul wants to blow up buildings with a money bomb, and we need to arrest him and his supporters.
[02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:02.581]  I'm not attacking Glenn Beck, but I've been there.
[02:34:02.581 --> 02:34:05.483]  I've seen them deceive.
[02:34:05.483 --> 02:34:15.549]  Today I was watching Fox News on the elliptical this morning, and they go, he's calling for violence, and then they cut to the clip, and it's not Trump calling for violence.
[02:34:15.549 --> 02:34:22.133]  I have never seen the gloves off like this, and they can barely try to suppress Trump.
[02:34:22.133 --> 02:34:25.555]  I mean, it's neck and neck right now, and it shows their power is waning.
[02:34:25.555 --> 02:34:26.776]  The question is, will they
[02:34:29.221 --> 02:34:36.366]  Start a huge war or do something catastrophic like Kim Jong-Un threatens before they get unseated from power.
[02:34:36.366 --> 02:34:40.388]  And the bigger question is, is it our own weakness that has empowered these people?
[02:34:40.388 --> 02:34:42.009]  I think it's a little bit of both.
[02:34:42.009 --> 02:34:51.756]  Before I go any further, we have a limited edition Hillary for Prison shirt that's almost like the old one that was the last limited edition, but people really wanted us to bring it back, so we did.
[02:34:53.300 --> 02:35:03.212]  And it's got Hillary for prison, 2016 looks like a campaign shirt, and our camera crews are all over the country at different political events and people are seeing them everywhere.
[02:35:03.212 --> 02:35:05.815]  They're getting all over the news, of course, obviously.
[02:35:07.677 --> 02:35:09.778]  Donald Trump's talked about the shirts as well.
[02:35:09.778 --> 02:35:12.958]  We've got them in all sizes available.
[02:35:12.958 --> 02:35:15.959]  Printed up and made right here in good old America.
[02:35:15.959 --> 02:35:21.281]  It has a 4.9 star review out of a possible five stars.
[02:35:21.281 --> 02:35:23.681]  That's from a third party review site, Power Reviews.
[02:35:23.681 --> 02:35:28.563]  We've got another variant of it that's also a collector's item with her as the Joker.
[02:35:28.563 --> 02:35:30.223]  And this is because she needs to be arrested.
[02:35:30.223 --> 02:35:31.403]  She's threatened everybody.
[02:35:31.403 --> 02:35:33.604]  She's told comedy clubs, don't make fun of me or I'll have you.
[02:35:34.204 --> 02:35:36.807]  You know, basically indicted or the IRS will come after you.
[02:35:36.807 --> 02:35:40.891]  So this is our big middle finger to Hillary to say, listen, we're going to exercise free speech.
[02:35:40.891 --> 02:35:43.754]  And the moral here is so clear.
[02:35:43.754 --> 02:35:45.977]  You either use free speech or you lose it.
[02:35:45.977 --> 02:35:46.998]  It's like muscles.
[02:35:46.998 --> 02:35:48.159]  Don't let them atrophy.
[02:35:48.159 --> 02:35:50.322]  And know your support in the broadcast when you get the shirt.
[02:35:51.442 --> 02:35:54.424]  We kind of have a, not a rip-off of the Trump hats that come in next week.
[02:35:54.424 --> 02:35:56.285]  It's the same design, same company.
[02:35:56.285 --> 02:35:58.867]  Big old redneck hat, I love it, so obnoxious.
[02:35:58.867 --> 02:36:00.788]  Says, make America free again.
[02:36:00.788 --> 02:36:03.610]  Because before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[02:36:03.610 --> 02:36:05.391]  It's freedom made us so great.
[02:36:05.391 --> 02:36:07.973]  We weren't even that free, but compared to other countries we were.
[02:36:07.973 --> 02:36:15.678]  So it's the idea that was great in America about its individualism, not what group you're in, not what gang, but what Martin Luther King said.
[02:36:17.165 --> 02:36:18.787]  The content of what you actually stand for.
[02:36:18.787 --> 02:36:20.209]  I don't care what color you are.
[02:36:20.209 --> 02:36:22.331]  If you cook good food, I'm going to your restaurant.
[02:36:22.331 --> 02:36:23.332]  I don't care what color you are.
[02:36:23.332 --> 02:36:25.755]  You play good music, I'm going to hear you.
[02:36:25.755 --> 02:36:26.776]  I don't care what color you are.
[02:36:26.776 --> 02:36:28.579]  If you're a good actor, I'm going to go watch you in a movie.
[02:36:30.393 --> 02:36:35.457]  I mean, I love actors of every stripe, and we've people fundamentally want to come together.
[02:36:35.457 --> 02:36:37.219]  We're tribally based.
[02:36:37.219 --> 02:36:44.184]  But how about a tribe based on free market economics that I want to spend a few minutes on with Louis Rockwell here, because it really is the answer.
[02:36:44.184 --> 02:36:56.835]  I mean, you study history, it's not even a comparison to fascism or Marxism or Leninism or all these other isms that are out there, oligarchy, any of it.
[02:36:57.615 --> 02:36:59.177]  It is the answer.
[02:36:59.177 --> 02:37:04.983]  The problem is it creates a bunch of spoiled brat kids later who get conned by the beatniks and the rest of them, so we're going to talk to them in a moment.
[02:37:04.983 --> 02:37:08.327]  But go to infowarestore.com, get the books, get the videos.
[02:37:08.327 --> 02:37:10.169]  We have a big special ending today.
[02:37:10.169 --> 02:37:18.278]  It's a nootropic, has a whole bunch of known ingredients in it that naturally and in a healthy way boost regular brain chemistry.
[02:37:19.176 --> 02:37:20.538]  And it is available.
[02:37:20.538 --> 02:37:24.784]  The special ends 45% off retail for Brain Force.
[02:37:24.784 --> 02:37:26.707]  And the small profit we make funds the operation.
[02:37:26.707 --> 02:37:27.948]  This is all about free will.
[02:37:27.948 --> 02:37:32.435]  The media criticizes us for selling stuff when they take taxpayer money and NPR and NBC.
[02:37:33.732 --> 02:37:36.013]  But our listeners and viewers see through it.
[02:37:36.013 --> 02:37:41.935]  Brain Force has natural brain activation ingredients like L-Theanine, Alpha-GPC, and a whole bunch of others.
[02:37:41.935 --> 02:37:43.555]  Special ends tonight.
[02:37:43.555 --> 02:37:46.296]  Take advantage of that today.

[02:38:16.212 --> 02:38:20.856]  Now going back to Lew Rockwell of LewRockwell.com and the Von Mies Institute, the head of it.
[02:38:21.656 --> 02:38:23.458]  Let's talk a few minutes about the solution.
[02:38:23.458 --> 02:38:29.724]  Not crony groups, not combines, not monopolies, not one-sided trade deals for insiders.
[02:38:29.724 --> 02:38:34.808]  Tell us about Lubig von Mies, the von Mies Institute, Austrian economics.
[02:38:34.808 --> 02:38:39.253]  Let's spend five minutes on that and a few minutes on any other subjects you want to cover and then some calls.
[02:38:40.370 --> 02:38:43.931]  Well, Alex, it just has to do, as you point out, with freedom.
[02:38:43.931 --> 02:38:54.375]  So, if we look at what has frozen up the economy, made it crony-oriented, made us all significantly poorer than we would be.
[02:38:54.375 --> 02:39:00.938]  We are significantly poorer as a people because of the existence of all these federal programs, these federal wars.
[02:39:00.938 --> 02:39:03.679]  But if we have to look, what's the worst thing the government does to us?
[02:39:04.059 --> 02:39:14.444]  Probably the Federal Reserve and the manipulation of the dollar, the banks, that whole apparatus bringing on recessions and depressions.
[02:39:14.444 --> 02:39:16.345]  We're probably in a recession right now.
[02:39:16.345 --> 02:39:18.386]  It's going to get worse.
[02:39:18.386 --> 02:39:20.347]  Maybe it won't be horrifically worse.
[02:39:20.347 --> 02:39:24.950]  We can certainly hope and pray, but a lot of bad things happening economically.
[02:39:26.030 --> 02:39:28.971]  The government regulations that impede entrepreneurs.
[02:39:28.971 --> 02:39:33.892]  Entrepreneurs are the spark plugs, really the driving force of an economy.
[02:39:33.892 --> 02:39:40.373]  The extent that they are hindered, taxed, and ordered about, it makes us all poorer.
[02:39:40.373 --> 02:39:49.735]  So, all the government regulations, of course all the government spending, the taxation, which of course has bad civil liberties standpoint, as well as ripping, as well as theft.
[02:39:52.476 --> 02:40:00.401]  You may get mugged on the street by a private criminal, but you're not necessarily going to ruin your whole life and change everything else you do.
[02:40:00.401 --> 02:40:10.126]  The government, of course, when they rip you off, when they mug you, it can affect everything in your business, everything you do as an entrepreneur, has very, very bad effects.
[02:40:10.126 --> 02:40:12.768]  So, really, we need less government.
[02:40:13.488 --> 02:40:18.309]  Maybe we're going to get less government if all these troubles continue.
[02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:30.151]  This constant attack on property rights, that's what's going on in North Carolina and these other states where the state government says if a restaurant wants to just have a male and female bathroom, that's fine.
[02:40:30.151 --> 02:40:38.653]  So they want to outlaw that and force a private restaurant to have the bathrooms that Caitlyn Jenner or whatever would like them to have.
[02:40:38.653 --> 02:40:39.613]  That's just
[02:40:40.413 --> 02:40:47.020]  Talk about fascism or socialism, but that's, you know, there's very little freedom of association left in this country.
[02:40:47.020 --> 02:40:49.062]  We should have freedom of association.
[02:40:49.062 --> 02:40:54.669]  Business people should be able to hire or fire whom they want, just according to the contracts they make.
[02:40:54.669 --> 02:40:56.611]  The government ought not to be involved.
[02:40:56.611 --> 02:40:58.553]  There ought to be freedom of speech.
[02:40:58.553 --> 02:41:00.915]  All the things that the government is attacking
[02:41:01.656 --> 02:41:02.536]  That's what we need.
[02:41:02.536 --> 02:41:11.159]  So just a rule of thumb, whatever the government is going after, whoever the government is demonizing, those are the people to be supported.
[02:41:11.159 --> 02:41:15.421]  It's, I think, just a general good rule of thumb even over that.
[02:41:15.421 --> 02:41:18.782]  Anything the government is telling you to believe, don't believe it.
[02:41:19.302 --> 02:41:22.724]  Anything they're telling you to do, it's not a good thing for you to do it.
[02:41:22.724 --> 02:41:26.507]  Maybe you'll do it from a prudential standpoint, because they've got the guns.
[02:41:26.507 --> 02:41:27.828]  We're not people of violence.
[02:41:27.828 --> 02:41:30.289]  That's the government way.
[02:41:30.289 --> 02:41:31.650]  We just want to educate people.
[02:41:31.650 --> 02:41:32.611]  We want to change hearts.
[02:41:32.611 --> 02:41:33.991]  We want to change minds.
[02:41:33.991 --> 02:41:45.299]  And by the way, as you keep pointing out, if we change enough hearts and minds, if people are willing to speak out, if they're willing to act, if they're willing to do it for themselves and their children, their grandchildren, their communities, their churches,
[02:41:45.959 --> 02:41:47.601]  That's why they're trying to extinct.
[02:42:02.173 --> 02:42:08.396]  Any free market choice or any grassroots free market activity, because they know no one can compete with free market.
[02:42:08.396 --> 02:42:10.117]  That's why they have government schools.
[02:42:10.117 --> 02:42:15.580]  And of course all these things, from our standpoint, from the standpoint of parents and students, are a failure.
[02:42:15.580 --> 02:42:17.381]  They're not a failure from the standpoint of the government.
[02:42:17.381 --> 02:42:19.262]  The government would like to dumb us all down.
[02:42:19.262 --> 02:42:22.884]  They'd like to extinguish critical thinking, independent thinking.
[02:42:22.884 --> 02:42:27.086]  And it's all, you know, so they're failure, they're great successes from the standpoint of the government.
[02:42:27.606 --> 02:42:30.108]  But, of course, failures from our standpoint.
[02:42:30.108 --> 02:42:33.931]  So, we want to push back about everything the government is doing to us.
[02:42:33.931 --> 02:42:40.015]  They have no right to take our money, to run our lives, to start wars.
[02:42:40.015 --> 02:42:41.956]  How many millions of people has the U.S.
[02:42:41.956 --> 02:42:46.620]  government killed in its career of wars, aggressive wars, all over the world?
[02:42:46.620 --> 02:42:48.341]  Tens of millions of people.
[02:42:48.341 --> 02:42:56.927]  I mean, we talk about the crimes of the Chinese communists, and we should, of the Soviet communists, and we definitely should, of Hitler and all his people, we definitely should.
[02:42:57.587 --> 02:42:58.248]  But the U.S.
[02:42:58.248 --> 02:43:05.474]  government is one of the great butchers in the history of mankind, while of course going around and pretending to be morally superior.
[02:43:05.474 --> 02:43:09.218]  So, they're not morally superior, they're morally inferior.
[02:43:09.218 --> 02:43:11.160]  They have to be opposed.
[02:43:11.160 --> 02:43:17.205]  First of all, in our hearts and minds, by our own learning, we have to learn something about economics, something about politics.
[02:43:17.205 --> 02:43:18.006]  I totally agree.
[02:43:18.566 --> 02:43:32.837]  And the way I get socialists to wake up is explaining that most of these multinationals write the laws, they're pretty much tax exempt, they're the ones pushing socialism at the grassroots to make us dependent so that we don't get uppity, so they can control and cut the cream off the top.
[02:43:32.837 --> 02:43:35.099]  It's crony capitalism that...
[02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:40.304]  These people are setting up and then they scapegoat real free market.
[02:43:40.304 --> 02:43:53.258]  Can you spend a few minutes describing, plus history's shown this, what even a little of free market does is create such renaissance, it quickly displaces the other systems just by choice in a bloodless revolution.
[02:43:53.258 --> 02:43:56.221]  That's why they act like it's the devil and want to shut it down.
[02:43:57.008 --> 02:44:05.692]  Well, of course it's true, and even as bad as things are today, even as corrupt and as fascist, socialist as the U.S.
[02:44:05.692 --> 02:44:10.014]  government is, as the controls of the economy, there are still great things happening.
[02:44:10.014 --> 02:44:15.456]  So, we can see wonderful entrepreneurs, wonderful companies serving us.
[02:44:15.976 --> 02:44:19.079]  Wonderful products that are available to us.
[02:44:19.079 --> 02:44:20.860]  There's still so much great stuff going on.
[02:44:20.860 --> 02:44:28.107]  But yes, it only requires, amazingly enough, just a small change to bring on much greater prosperity.
[02:44:28.107 --> 02:44:33.071]  And there's no way of telling if we had a free market economy in this country.
[02:44:33.331 --> 02:44:33.511]  Sure.
[02:44:33.511 --> 02:44:39.555]  We didn't have the federal car bunk over there in Washington, uh, uh, diseasing all of us and diseasing the economy.
[02:44:39.555 --> 02:44:41.136]  There's no telling how wealthy we would be.
[02:44:41.136 --> 02:44:42.997]  Everybody would be much wealthier.
[02:44:42.997 --> 02:44:44.978]  There would never have been a society.
[02:44:44.978 --> 02:44:51.583]  The current day America would look like, uh, Appalachia compared to what, uh, uh, could be the case.
[02:44:51.583 --> 02:44:54.765]  So we're capable of, um, a socially much healthier society.
[02:44:54.765 --> 02:44:55.925]  And by the way, you dig deeper.
[02:44:55.925 --> 02:44:57.867]  The government's attacking families.
[02:44:57.867 --> 02:45:01.349]  It's attacking all the, all the, uh, indices of social health.
[02:45:01.829 --> 02:45:03.490]  In order to make us serfs.
[02:45:03.490 --> 02:45:05.131]  They don't want to make us poorer.
[02:45:05.131 --> 02:45:07.172]  They want to control us.
[02:45:07.172 --> 02:45:10.514]  It's the whole purpose of the immigration inundation and many other things they're doing.
[02:45:10.514 --> 02:45:15.578]  And that's because they're scared of what they call disruptive technologies and quote empowered individuals.
[02:45:15.578 --> 02:45:17.459]  The Pentagon even mentioned Jade Helm.
[02:45:17.459 --> 02:45:18.820]  They're practicing to take over the U.S.
[02:45:18.820 --> 02:45:22.262]  domestically and they say we're worried about empowered individuals.
[02:45:23.373 --> 02:45:26.595]  We're worried about new economies and new systems we don't control.
[02:45:26.595 --> 02:45:30.857]  Now, I'm not demonizing our military itself, but the controllers are giving them that mission.
[02:45:30.857 --> 02:45:35.040]  You know, the Special Forces says, you know, free the oppressed or defend the oppressed.
[02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:37.681]  They've totally turned it into the opposite of that.
[02:45:37.681 --> 02:45:38.882]  And there they are.
[02:45:39.682 --> 02:45:48.388]  Scared of the next innovation that'll come from private industry in the next Tinker's Garage that'll overthrow all these monopolies they've created.
[02:45:48.388 --> 02:45:51.450]  Just think about any of us who've ever had anything to do with the government.
[02:45:51.450 --> 02:45:55.973]  People who've been in the military, people who've had to deal with the bureaucracy, all of us at the DMV or whatever.
[02:45:56.673 --> 02:46:00.416]  The government as an institution is a very stupid thing.
[02:46:00.416 --> 02:46:03.259]  It's just like a low IQ thing.
[02:46:03.259 --> 02:46:11.886]  It's not only not effective, it's massively destructive and stupid.
[02:46:11.886 --> 02:46:15.049]  Whether it's bombing people, whether it's economically bombing us.
[02:46:15.849 --> 02:46:22.091]  Uh, it's just doing horrible things, and there's of course a vast propaganda campaign to make you think they're doing you good.
[02:46:22.091 --> 02:46:22.831]  And it's disconnected!
[02:46:22.831 --> 02:46:34.294]  You don't have, you don't know what's good for yourself, but all the creeps, the Hillarys and the, and the Obamas and the Paul Ryans and the, all the rest of the, you know, the, uh, cruises of the world, they know what's best for you.
[02:46:34.294 --> 02:46:35.114]  You know what?
[02:46:35.114 --> 02:46:37.395]  Uh, no they don't, they're in fact your enemies.
[02:46:38.095 --> 02:46:44.060]  And doesn't it show their arrogance, Lou, that they would try to run Hillary and Jeb in everybody's face?
[02:46:44.060 --> 02:46:46.842]  I mean, it just shows their disconnect.
[02:46:46.842 --> 02:46:54.308]  Well, and also, I think they're going to run somebody in Trump's place who's going to cause a lot of trouble for them.
[02:46:54.308 --> 02:47:00.252]  And I just hope, by the way, that Trump... I wish to goodness Trump were planning right now to run as an independent.
[02:47:00.252 --> 02:47:02.874]  He'll still be able to run as an independent for quite a while.
[02:47:02.874 --> 02:47:04.015]  Couldn't he run as a libertarian?
[02:47:04.015 --> 02:47:04.836]  They have ballot access.
[02:47:05.296 --> 02:47:08.718]  Yeah, but the Libertarians, I'm sorry to say, would never nominate him.
[02:47:08.718 --> 02:47:11.419]  I'd like to see it, but I don't believe it's possible.
[02:47:11.419 --> 02:47:22.625]  He would have to, in my view, have to run as an independent, and Richard Winger, who's the great ballot access guy, I had a piece from him in Luraco.com the other day, about how Trump can run as an independent.
[02:47:22.625 --> 02:47:28.107]  Also, existing parties he could get, the Reform Party and so forth, he could get on the ballot with.
[02:47:28.107 --> 02:47:29.968]  It is possible for him to do it.
[02:47:29.968 --> 02:47:33.350]  I think it's a very good thing to hold over the Republican Party's head, for example,
[02:47:33.690 --> 02:47:39.956]  I mean, he's always said from the beginning, he's only staying loyal to the party and the nominee if he's treated fairly.
[02:47:39.956 --> 02:47:41.498]  Well, treated fairly?
[02:47:41.498 --> 02:47:47.464]  They put a ball and chain around both his legs.
[02:47:47.464 --> 02:47:57.454]  So he's very much justified in every sense to be getting ready to run as an independent if they steal the nomination from him.
[02:47:57.774 --> 02:47:59.055]  It's incredible, but I agree with you.
[02:47:59.055 --> 02:48:01.036]  By the way, you could win as an independent.
[02:48:01.036 --> 02:48:03.278]  I think they've miscalculated, Lou.
[02:48:03.278 --> 02:48:18.567]  I mean, if they really... I was looking at how arrogant Prevost is, like a smiling vampire on Fox News, and then this other curly, moe, hewland, arrogantly... They really think laughing at us... What's weird is they laugh at us arrogantly rubbing it in.
[02:48:18.567 --> 02:48:19.928]  It's like they're mentally ill or something.
[02:48:20.208 --> 02:48:22.190]  Well, they do laugh at us.
[02:48:22.190 --> 02:48:23.071]  We're all laughable.
[02:48:23.071 --> 02:48:24.352]  We're just the peons.
[02:48:24.352 --> 02:48:25.894]  We're the cash cows.
[02:48:25.894 --> 02:48:32.620]  Our only job is to work hard and give them the money, give them the power, and let them live it up.
[02:48:32.620 --> 02:48:35.063]  So, they're a very bad bunch.
[02:48:35.063 --> 02:48:39.207]  Previous, Curly, and all these people are, of course, just typical.
[02:48:39.912 --> 02:48:40.332]  You're right.
[02:48:40.332 --> 02:48:41.113]  Let's take a few calls.
[02:48:41.113 --> 02:48:41.733]  We're about to go to break.
[02:48:41.733 --> 02:48:42.614]  Let's get one in now.
[02:48:42.614 --> 02:48:43.955]  Lou Rockwell's our guest.
[02:48:43.955 --> 02:48:46.376]  I mean, look, my job's easy now, folks.
[02:48:46.376 --> 02:48:48.998]  Stuff is so out in the open since I've been on 21 years.
[02:48:48.998 --> 02:48:50.659]  You've been fighting tyranny for 40 years, Lou.
[02:48:50.659 --> 02:48:55.582]  I mean, do you agree with me just briefly that tyranny is now more brazen and open than ever?
[02:48:55.582 --> 02:48:56.743]  Our job is easier than ever.
[02:48:57.443 --> 02:48:59.945]  That's true, and I think more and more people are waking up.
[02:48:59.945 --> 02:49:07.713]  Young people are especially waking up because of the student loans they face, getting degrees that are totally useless in the marketplace.
[02:49:07.713 --> 02:49:17.162]  Another big rip-off, of course, is the whole education system, designed and run by the government, ripping off students, and there is resistance.
[02:49:17.162 --> 02:49:19.384]  Teaching them for an economy that doesn't even exist.
[02:49:19.384 --> 02:49:21.646]  Kevin in Canada, you're on the air with Lew Rockwell.
[02:49:21.646 --> 02:49:22.667]  Go ahead with your question or comment.
[02:49:23.803 --> 02:49:31.728]  Hey Alex, I've been on X2 for two years and I've quit smoking for one year starting this month, so I owe you a thank you for that.
[02:49:31.728 --> 02:49:33.569]  Wow, I didn't know X2 could help with that.
[02:49:33.569 --> 02:49:37.951]  I mean, overall, what did it do once you took it?
[02:49:37.951 --> 02:49:48.498]  I'm not a doctor, but my theory is that it's cleaned out my thyroid, which plays a huge part in your attitude, the way you feel, and cravings.
[02:49:48.498 --> 02:49:51.139]  And I figure, while I was smoking, I was taking it.
[02:49:51.139 --> 02:49:52.420]  I didn't take it to quit smoking.
[02:49:52.950 --> 02:49:59.297]  But about eight months in, I hated this taste of cigarettes, and it wasn't doing anything for me when I would smoke them.
[02:50:00.051 --> 02:50:05.154]  So literally, I quit with my best friend and it's been a year, like I said.
[02:50:05.154 --> 02:50:08.836]  Well, true iodine deficiency is, you die without it.
[02:50:08.836 --> 02:50:11.358]  There's no real iodine supplement out there that we've discovered.
[02:50:11.358 --> 02:50:13.459]  That's why we made our own with Top Scientist.
[02:50:13.459 --> 02:50:16.501]  That's why it's such a huge... I'm going to skip this network break because this is so important.
[02:50:16.501 --> 02:50:24.165]  I want Lou to have time to get to the other point because you were... Thank you for the testimony, Kevin, but that's why everybody should get next to... It is true deep earth iodine, unbound.
[02:50:24.165 --> 02:50:26.306]  It turns purple blue on paper, not red.
[02:50:26.306 --> 02:50:27.847]  It's not bound stuff.
[02:50:27.847 --> 02:50:28.528]  It's special.
[02:50:29.188 --> 02:50:32.670]  And it's the good halogen, and this is a huge conspiracy.
[02:50:32.670 --> 02:50:39.155]  The government used to put it in the salt, a bad version, mind you, because they didn't want, you know, huge IQ reductions in the country.
[02:50:39.155 --> 02:50:42.797]  Then they started taking it out again, they put the bad halogen in the water, that's the fluoride.
[02:50:42.797 --> 02:50:46.720]  This is the answer to fluoride, it's X2, and it's at Infowarslive.com.
[02:50:46.720 --> 02:50:52.403]  So thank you for the plug, but getting back to Lew Rockwell, it says you had a point here about Senator Sessions and NATO control.
[02:50:52.403 --> 02:50:53.344]  Go ahead.
[02:50:53.344 --> 02:50:57.807]  I mean, we, I watch the show quite a bit, so the video that you put out,
[02:50:58.328 --> 02:51:09.797]  With Senator Sessions questioning Leon Panetta, Secretary of Defense, in regards to when the United States has the authority to go to war.
[02:51:09.797 --> 02:51:12.359]  Oh yes, and he said when NATO gives us the authorization.
[02:51:12.359 --> 02:51:13.700]  He said we don't get it from Congress now.
[02:51:13.700 --> 02:51:15.942]  Yeah, that's powerful.
[02:51:15.942 --> 02:51:19.925]  Look what Trump, the powerful thing is, look what Trump said about NATO.
[02:51:19.925 --> 02:51:25.010]  He didn't put his friend down and say, well the reason why I'm saying this is because of Sessions.
[02:51:25.010 --> 02:51:27.932]  But I can almost feel in the back of my mind that
[02:51:28.311 --> 02:51:34.413]  The reason why Trump rang this up in the first place is because a good man like Sessions actually rang it up to begin with.
[02:51:34.413 --> 02:51:34.914]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:51:34.914 --> 02:51:39.315]  I'm not going to brag because it's actually dangerous and they pay attention now and write stories about it.
[02:51:39.315 --> 02:51:42.036]  But let me just tell you this.
[02:51:42.036 --> 02:51:49.179]  Unless Donald Trump is the greatest actor ever and he's conning everybody behind the scenes in the last four or five years, he's learned about all this stuff.
[02:51:49.179 --> 02:51:53.801]  Before he ran, I was told this by a movie star, who knows Trump on record as friends with him.
[02:51:55.109 --> 02:51:57.570]  And, you know, the truth is Trump is dialed into all this.
[02:51:57.570 --> 02:51:58.690]  He's dialed into Ron Paul.
[02:51:58.690 --> 02:51:59.710]  He's dialed into Lew Rockwell.
[02:51:59.710 --> 02:52:00.951]  He's dialed into my show.
[02:52:00.951 --> 02:52:03.852]  But specifically, I was told Ron Paul, Lew Rockwell.
[02:52:03.852 --> 02:52:09.433]  And quite frankly, I'm not going to get into it, but the Trump people are obviously going to want to reach out to Lew Rockwell and other people.
[02:52:09.433 --> 02:52:12.174]  Believe me, Trump found out about all this like a decade ago.
[02:52:12.174 --> 02:52:13.115]  He didn't believe it.
[02:52:13.115 --> 02:52:14.575]  Now he knows it's true.
[02:52:14.575 --> 02:52:16.376]  He really is an egomaniac.
[02:52:16.376 --> 02:52:19.917]  I mean, according to his inside sources, he does want to save the country, though.
[02:52:19.917 --> 02:52:20.777]  He's a good egomaniac.
[02:52:21.397 --> 02:52:23.219]  And he just doesn't like screwing people over.
[02:52:23.219 --> 02:52:24.441]  He loves free market.
[02:52:24.441 --> 02:52:26.683]  He's done some things, you know, that aren't perfect in the market.
[02:52:26.683 --> 02:52:29.687]  You know, once he's building something, somebody's trying to stop him, then he goes out, you know.
[02:52:29.687 --> 02:52:31.349]  I mean, he is aggressive alpha male.
[02:52:31.349 --> 02:52:32.671]  They're scared of him.
[02:52:32.671 --> 02:52:37.636]  And the word is from a whole bunch of sources is that he... And I keep getting told, watch, he's going to do this, and he doesn't.
[02:52:38.337 --> 02:52:48.321]  And so, and I'm not going to talk about some of the behind-the-scenes stuff, but the point is, is that it's pretty scary to know that the establishment is this scared, is what I'm saying.
[02:52:48.321 --> 02:52:49.802]  That's a good point he makes, though.
[02:52:49.802 --> 02:53:01.267]  Senator Sessions makes a big deal out of being told, you don't have authority over where we go to war, with the authorization to attack Syria, which they finally helped defeat with Ron Paul's and, of course, Senator Paul's help.
[02:53:01.267 --> 02:53:03.848]  And, of course, Ted Cruz jumped on the bandwagon later.
[02:53:03.848 --> 02:53:05.509]  But looking at that,
[02:53:06.370 --> 02:53:10.484]  Knowing that he's advised by folks like Sessions, that's a positive for me, Lou Rockwell.
[02:53:11.411 --> 02:53:15.354]  For sure, I think it is, and it's very important to go after NATO.
[02:53:15.354 --> 02:53:20.997]  It's just one of the organizations, you know, if Albania is capable of getting the U.S.
[02:53:20.997 --> 02:53:23.879]  into a third world war under this, under NATO.
[02:53:23.879 --> 02:53:25.620]  And there are other organizations like this.
[02:53:25.620 --> 02:53:26.001]  The U.S.
[02:53:26.001 --> 02:53:31.544]  has got these so-called alliances, and they're actually imperial alliances with countries all over the world.
[02:53:31.544 --> 02:53:33.986]  Remember how Georgia tried to get us into war with Russia?
[02:53:33.986 --> 02:53:35.347]  Yeah, we need to get out.
[02:53:35.347 --> 02:53:36.988]  We need to get out of NATO.
[02:53:36.988 --> 02:53:38.469]  We need to free Europe, by the way.
[02:53:38.469 --> 02:53:40.150]  This is a method for the U.S.
[02:53:40.150 --> 02:53:40.851]  to control Europe.
[02:53:42.172 --> 02:53:43.833]  They should be freed.
[02:53:43.833 --> 02:53:45.614]  I'm sure they're sick and tired of being U.S.
[02:53:45.614 --> 02:53:49.298]  colonies except for the people at the top who are all on the payroll.
[02:53:49.298 --> 02:53:50.278]  Merkel.
[02:53:50.278 --> 02:53:56.243]  Merkel and the evil Merkel and Cameron and Hollande and people of that sort.
[02:53:56.243 --> 02:53:59.126]  But a lot of people in Europe are ready for a change, too, by the way.
[02:53:59.126 --> 02:54:00.587]  It's not just in this country.
[02:54:00.587 --> 02:54:02.568]  This is an international freedom movement.
[02:54:02.568 --> 02:54:03.629]  And I want to be clear.
[02:54:03.629 --> 02:54:08.153]  The big megabanks that have hijacked this country that folks back in Congress in 1913 talked about
[02:54:11.434 --> 02:54:13.035]  They are doing all this in our name.
[02:54:13.035 --> 02:54:13.955]  We're paying for it.
[02:54:13.955 --> 02:54:15.836]  We don't even get a benefit.
[02:54:15.836 --> 02:54:16.937]  And so we talk about the U.S.
[02:54:16.937 --> 02:54:17.617]  occupying Europe.
[02:54:17.617 --> 02:54:17.997]  I agree.
[02:54:17.997 --> 02:54:19.338]  Technically, that's what's happening.
[02:54:19.338 --> 02:54:23.380]  But at the same time, it's the very same corporate interests that are occupying Europe or occupying us.
[02:54:23.380 --> 02:54:25.001]  We're all in this together.
[02:54:25.001 --> 02:54:26.862]  Isn't the Brexit exciting, Lew Rockwell?
[02:54:27.944 --> 02:54:30.706]  Oh, I think that Brexit is, I'm 100% for it.
[02:54:30.706 --> 02:54:33.889]  This would be so fantastic if Britain gets out of the EU.
[02:54:33.889 --> 02:54:38.172]  The EU is an evil, global government kind of institution.
[02:54:38.172 --> 02:54:43.377]  Highly bureaucratic, ordering people around, very corrupt, very dangerous.
[02:54:44.057 --> 02:54:48.679]  And all of Europe needs to get out, and it's great of all the opposition in Eastern Europe.
[02:54:48.679 --> 02:54:54.200]  Some of the people who lived under communism are more freedom-oriented than the people further west.
[02:54:54.200 --> 02:55:01.562]  So maybe... Well, that's because they've already enjoyed the total... Hungary and Poland and Slovakia, Czech Republic and so forth.
[02:55:01.562 --> 02:55:03.983]  Maybe these countries are going to save Europe.
[02:55:03.983 --> 02:55:06.084]  Maybe they're going to set a good example for us.
[02:55:06.084 --> 02:55:09.725]  And just, you know, apropos of that, your caller's point, Alex,
[02:55:10.285 --> 02:55:14.369]  It's so important to free yourself to the extent you can from the medical monopoly.
[02:55:14.369 --> 02:55:19.674]  You know, Obamacare and all that is dangerous to your health.
[02:55:19.674 --> 02:55:25.739]  To the extent you can be independent, that you can take care of your own health, very, very important.
[02:55:25.739 --> 02:55:29.943]  So don't just, don't be a shill for the government in that way either.
[02:55:29.943 --> 02:55:35.589]  That's all, Obamacare is designed to sicken you, to get rich off you, not to cure you of anything.
[02:55:36.149 --> 02:55:41.672]  Ask him about Trump being an alpha male.
[02:55:41.672 --> 02:55:42.632]  What is wrong with that?
[02:55:42.632 --> 02:55:45.594]  Isn't it nice to have a masculine guy rather than a metrosexual?
[02:55:45.594 --> 02:55:49.496]  I mean, it seems to me Trump is a nice change.
[02:55:49.496 --> 02:55:53.958]  And I think it's why, by the way, he appeals to women much more than you would learn from the media.
[02:55:53.958 --> 02:55:56.740]  Although I think we all know, what did I see just the other day?
[02:55:56.740 --> 02:56:00.041]  6% of Americans say they fully trust the media.
[02:56:00.041 --> 02:56:01.442]  And I guess they probably all work for them.
[02:56:01.442 --> 02:56:02.042]  That's good news.
[02:56:02.042 --> 02:56:07.326]  The only thing more unpopular than the government with a 9% in Gallup was the media at 6, exactly.
[02:56:07.326 --> 02:56:08.547]  And there's another poll too.
[02:56:08.547 --> 02:56:09.788]  The media is the government.
[02:56:09.788 --> 02:56:18.975]  I mean, the media is connected to the government just as surely as Pravda and Nazi papers and communist papers all over the world were connected to their governments.
[02:56:18.975 --> 02:56:19.936]  So they've really already collapsed.
[02:56:19.936 --> 02:56:22.698]  The only thing is they pretend to be independent, but of course they're not.
[02:56:22.698 --> 02:56:23.618]  They've already collapsed.
[02:56:23.618 --> 02:56:25.440]  They just don't seem to know it yet like zombies.
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:26.460]  Thank you, Kevin.
[02:56:26.460 --> 02:56:27.601]  Let's talk to John in Texas.
[02:56:27.601 --> 02:56:29.363]  You're on the air with Lou Rockwell at lourockwell.com.
[02:56:30.663 --> 02:56:31.644]  Hi Alex.
[02:56:31.644 --> 02:56:34.126]  Go ahead, brother.
[02:56:34.126 --> 02:56:40.070]  Communist goals, which is part of the congressional record, right at the top of the communist goals, it says promote free trade.
[02:56:40.896 --> 02:56:51.020]  And the fact that all of our manufacturing jobs went over there to that evil communist police state in China to build them up into a first-class superpower is the greatest act of treason that's ever been done to this country.
[02:56:51.020 --> 02:56:52.721]  Sure, but that's not real free trade.
[02:56:52.721 --> 02:56:57.343]  I mean, when China has a 35% economic currency tariff on us, it's not free trade.
[02:56:57.343 --> 02:57:00.764]  When they don't have the same standards as we do, they put them on us, that's not free trade.
[02:57:00.764 --> 02:57:05.746]  So, people get confused by this and think, well, then why is Alex Jones and Ron Paul or LeRockwell for free?
[02:57:05.746 --> 02:57:08.187]  I'm for open trade as long as it's a good deal.
[02:57:09.508 --> 02:57:14.431]  Well, what's your specific point, John, and we'll let LeRocco respond here in closing.
[02:57:14.431 --> 02:57:21.316]  Well, I just thought that was one of the big acts of treason, the fact that that free trade agreement was used to arm up China into a first-rate superpower.
[02:57:21.316 --> 02:57:22.457]  It's a one-sided deal, though.
[02:57:22.457 --> 02:57:23.818]  It wasn't a fair trade, absolutely.
[02:57:23.818 --> 02:57:24.919]  It was a one-sided deal.
[02:57:24.919 --> 02:57:26.820]  So, Louie, what would you say about that?
[02:57:26.820 --> 02:57:27.620]  How do you gauge that?
[02:57:27.620 --> 02:57:32.764]  I would say, by the way, Jeff, I might make the point that China's military budget is less than 10% of the U.S.'
[02:57:32.684 --> 02:57:33.945]  's, so it's not
[02:57:34.825 --> 02:57:36.346]  It's not a first class superpower.
[02:57:36.346 --> 02:57:40.368]  It's just another thing they're wanting to gin up.
[02:57:40.368 --> 02:57:42.289]  They want a war with Russia and China.
[02:57:42.289 --> 02:57:44.451]  Hillary has talked about this, Cruz.
[02:57:44.451 --> 02:57:47.652]  Oh yeah, China is teetering on the verge of total collapse.
[02:57:47.652 --> 02:57:49.073]  They would like a world war.
[02:57:49.073 --> 02:57:50.254]  So what is free trade?
[02:57:50.254 --> 02:57:51.775]  Because I do believe in free trade.
[02:57:52.435 --> 02:57:53.855]  You know, just like George H.W.
[02:57:53.855 --> 02:57:59.097]  Bush and George W. Bush and Obama talk about freedom, they mean, of course, anti-freedom.
[02:57:59.097 --> 02:58:01.157]  They talk about free trade, they mean anti-free trade.
[02:58:01.157 --> 02:58:01.877]  What is free trade?
[02:58:01.877 --> 02:58:11.420]  It means if I'm a businessman, I can sell my goods to somebody in Germany or China or Mexico or any other place and I can buy from there without the government interfering.
[02:58:11.420 --> 02:58:17.881]  It doesn't mean these managed trade treaties that are designed to, like NAFTA, to benefit the cronies.
[02:58:17.881 --> 02:58:19.062]  14,000 pages long!
[02:58:19.062 --> 02:58:20.402]  That's not free, it's a screw job.
[02:58:20.862 --> 02:58:22.183]  I actually looked through NAFTA.
[02:58:22.183 --> 02:58:26.984]  I spent a whole day talking about wasting a day going through the NAFTA treaty.
[02:58:26.984 --> 02:58:31.166]  And of course it was just full of how they're going to benefit Caterpillar or Westinghouse.
[02:58:31.166 --> 02:58:32.126]  Lou, this is too important.
[02:58:32.126 --> 02:58:32.607]  Do five more.
[02:58:32.607 --> 02:58:34.187]  I know you've got to go, but we're back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:34.187 --> 02:58:35.228]  Do five more with us.
[02:58:35.228 --> 02:58:37.008]  Finish up on a guy when he was in Congress.
[02:58:37.008 --> 02:58:38.509]  Dug through NAFTA.
[02:58:38.509 --> 02:58:40.370]  Literally a room full of crap.
[02:58:40.370 --> 02:58:41.410]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:41.410 --> 02:58:41.910]  Fourth hour.
[02:58:41.910 --> 02:58:44.711]  Paul Watson will come in from London in about eight minutes.
[02:58:49.454 --> 02:58:53.258]  Anthony Gucciardi here with an InfoWars health news update with Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.258 --> 02:58:54.219]  That's right, Anthony.
[02:58:54.219 --> 02:58:57.163]  One of our top selling products is BrainForce.
[02:58:57.163 --> 02:59:01.467]  It is very affordably priced at retail that we normally discount it.
[02:59:01.467 --> 02:59:10.678]  We've discounted from the discount 25%, but if you count it from its regular price, that's 45% discount for a limited time at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:11.118 --> 02:59:14.302]  There are a lot of brain boosters out there, or what's known as nootropics.
[02:59:14.302 --> 02:59:17.246]  But here's what separates Brain Force from the rest.
[02:59:17.246 --> 02:59:28.662]  Unlike some energy drinks and supplements, Brain Force uses natural brain activation ingredients, like yerba mate extract, alpha-GPC, L-theanine, hyperzine A, phosphatidylserine, B12, and many others.
[02:59:29.042 --> 02:59:34.664]  Major nutraceutical review sites rave about this formulation and they also rave about the price.
[02:59:34.664 --> 02:59:46.429]  Secure your BrainForce today at Infowarslife.com and get 45% off retail, 25% off the regular sales price on BrainForce for a limited time at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:59:46.429 --> 02:59:48.310]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:10.985 --> 03:00:15.676]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:29.537 --> 03:00:33.079]  Alright, final segment that I'm hot-showing here, that Paul Watson's taking over.
[03:00:33.079 --> 03:00:40.042]  I want to take maybe one more call, but Gideon McAleer-Rockwell, look at NAFTA, look at GATT, look at the TPP.
[03:00:40.042 --> 03:00:43.243]  If they got away with that, you know, why not just go ahead and cancel elections?
[03:00:43.243 --> 03:00:56.369]  Foreign groups write some multi-thousand page piece of garbage, 200 pages of summary, and then we can't see it until it's already globally passed, and then Ted Cruz votes to fast-track it, but claims he's against it, when his wife helped write it.
[03:00:57.009 --> 03:00:58.870]  If I'm ashamed of anything, Lew Rockwell, it's this.
[03:00:58.870 --> 03:01:02.773]  I've been neutral on Ted Cruz because of how he was acting in the Senate on a few issues.
[03:01:02.773 --> 03:01:10.857]  But man, if he isn't a Bush Rockefeller sleeper cell, nobody is.
[03:01:10.857 --> 03:01:14.400]  In Texas, he was the Solicitor General of George W. Bush.
[03:01:17.405 --> 03:01:21.046]  Then he got a job through the Bush administration at the Federal Trade Commission.
[03:01:21.046 --> 03:01:26.007]  The federal Bush administration versus the state Bush administration.
[03:01:26.007 --> 03:01:29.908]  He and his wife were heralded as the first Bush campaign marriage.
[03:01:29.908 --> 03:01:35.490]  They were both working for George W. Bush and they got married.
[03:01:35.490 --> 03:01:38.070]  These people, and of course she's a total Busher.
[03:01:38.070 --> 03:01:40.171]  So this is the fourth term?
[03:01:41.653 --> 03:01:42.514]  Yeah.
[03:01:42.514 --> 03:01:46.597]  Well, Cruz is a very bad guy.
[03:01:46.597 --> 03:01:50.841]  It's not a coincidence he looks like a vampire.
[03:01:50.841 --> 03:01:55.825]  Well, they say he's completely hateful and cold in person, but acts all nice on the surface.
[03:01:55.825 --> 03:02:00.069]  Well, all he needs is a set of fangs and we'll know who he is.
[03:02:00.069 --> 03:02:05.494]  Lou Rockwell, getting back to NAFTA and the thousands of pages of that and other key tidbits, we really appreciate your time.
[03:02:06.616 --> 03:02:10.438]  Well, it's, you know, as I mentioned, I actually went through the whole NAFTA.
[03:02:10.438 --> 03:02:14.019]  As you say, we're not allowed to look through the TPP agreement.
[03:02:14.019 --> 03:02:19.701]  But I looked in those days, slightly freer days, I was able to look through the whole thing.
[03:02:19.701 --> 03:02:23.683]  And it consisted of nothing but special deals, just as you might expect.
[03:02:23.683 --> 03:02:26.024]  Special crony deals.
[03:02:26.024 --> 03:02:28.605]  It didn't mean, for example, here's free trade with Mexico.
[03:02:28.965 --> 03:02:34.606]  I can drive my car to Mexico, fill it up with goods, bring it back and wave at the border guards on the way in.
[03:02:34.606 --> 03:02:35.947]  That's free trade.
[03:02:35.947 --> 03:02:38.467]  Of course, that's not what's allowed.
[03:02:38.467 --> 03:02:48.830]  Everything has to be operated through the crony banks, through the crony companies, the other ones who benefit, and regular Americans get the short end of the stick, as is always the case.
[03:02:48.830 --> 03:02:49.810]  Here's a quick example.
[03:02:49.810 --> 03:02:50.310]  Here's a quick example.
[03:02:50.310 --> 03:02:51.431]  These are very bad deals.
[03:02:51.431 --> 03:02:52.251]  Very bad deals.
[03:02:52.876 --> 03:03:00.563]  I was going to buy my dad like a $1,200, you know, one of the cheaper Tag Heuer watches, one of the sports ones.
[03:03:00.563 --> 03:03:03.085]  And I'm in Cancun about six months ago.
[03:03:03.085 --> 03:03:04.346]  I'm buying it.
[03:03:04.346 --> 03:03:11.413]  And then when I came back through, I'd written it down, but they knew in a computer what I'd bought and got in my face at the border.
[03:03:11.413 --> 03:03:12.554]  And so I went and looked it up.
[03:03:12.554 --> 03:03:14.115]  All that's database between the U.S.
[03:03:14.115 --> 03:03:14.856]  and Mexico.
[03:03:14.856 --> 03:03:16.858]  That's the opposite of free trade under NAFTA and GATT.
[03:03:17.486 --> 03:03:18.827]  Well, it's just fascism.
[03:03:18.827 --> 03:03:20.368]  I mean, it's just surveillance.
[03:03:20.368 --> 03:03:21.369]  It's surveillance.
[03:03:21.369 --> 03:03:24.110]  They talk about something else evil they're doing.
[03:03:24.110 --> 03:03:28.213]  Everywhere you look in American society, the government is the enemy.
[03:03:28.213 --> 03:03:29.814]  The government is hurting us.
[03:03:29.814 --> 03:03:31.055]  They're ripping us off.
[03:03:31.055 --> 03:03:31.936]  They're destroying us.
[03:03:31.936 --> 03:03:33.657]  They're destroying our economic futures.
[03:03:33.657 --> 03:03:35.578]  They're destroying our children's futures.
[03:03:35.578 --> 03:03:36.719]  They're destroying education.
[03:03:37.964 --> 03:03:39.865]  They're destroying families.
[03:03:39.865 --> 03:03:44.507]  A $1,200 watch is on a computer screen at Customs, but they can't stop the illegals.
[03:03:44.507 --> 03:03:52.652]  You know, I'm sure even you, knowing what you know, would be shocked if you could see what your dossier looks like and how much they know and what detail.
[03:03:52.652 --> 03:03:54.152]  That's true of all of us.
[03:03:54.152 --> 03:03:57.914]  They have unbelievable details on every aspect of our lives.
[03:03:57.914 --> 03:03:59.315]  But we know nothing about them.
[03:03:59.315 --> 03:04:00.396]  They're more secretive than ever.
[03:04:01.036 --> 03:04:02.957]  As Ron Paul always says, there should be the opposite.
[03:04:02.957 --> 03:04:04.999]  There should be total transparency for the government.
[03:04:04.999 --> 03:04:07.180]  Let's have a camera in the White House and so forth.
[03:04:07.180 --> 03:04:11.903]  But we should have no transparency whatsoever, except when we voluntarily give up.
[03:04:11.903 --> 03:04:15.186]  So we should have total privacy, they total transparency.
[03:04:15.186 --> 03:04:17.087]  Of course, it's just the opposite.
[03:04:17.087 --> 03:04:19.028]  Privacy is our greatest asset.
[03:04:19.028 --> 03:04:20.609]  We're naked before them.
[03:04:20.609 --> 03:04:30.536]  They're able to pull off any scam, any rip-off, any theft, any corruption, any horrible tyranny, and tell us it's good for us.
[03:04:30.536 --> 03:04:30.676]  Wow.
[03:04:31.476 --> 03:04:31.617]  Yeah.
[03:04:31.617 --> 03:04:33.998]  All right, Lew Rockwell, powerful interview.
[03:04:33.998 --> 03:04:34.819]  Thank you for the time, sir.
[03:04:34.819 --> 03:04:36.060]  Look forward to speaking to you very soon.
[03:04:36.060 --> 03:04:36.840]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:04:36.840 --> 03:04:37.801]  Great to be with you.
[03:04:37.801 --> 03:04:39.022]  Thank you.
[03:04:39.022 --> 03:04:49.089]  Ah, boy, I tell you, we can only get Ron Paul to at least come out and say that he supports free and open elections and doesn't like what's happening to Trump.
[03:04:49.089 --> 03:04:52.191]  And I know little birdies that are working on it.
[03:04:52.191 --> 03:04:58.316]  Ladies and gentlemen, Paul Joseph Watson from Her Botanic Majesty's Albion, straight ahead.
[03:04:59.266 --> 03:05:02.010]  Today is Monday, April 18th, and here's some of the latest news.
[03:05:02.010 --> 03:05:06.456]  It's now known that the Colorado lawmakers who voted to scrap the state primary are in fact Ted Cruz delegates.
[03:05:06.456 --> 03:05:11.423]  Four state Republicans voted against a bill that would allow Colorado voters the chance to vote in a presidential primary.
[03:05:11.423 --> 03:05:15.849]  And all of them are Cruz supporters, with three of them listed as members of Cruz's Colorado leadership team.
[03:05:16.209 --> 03:05:23.772]  And one of them, Senator Kevin Grantham, even had the audacity to brag about Cruz's quote victory on Twitter despite the fact that the voters did not get to pick a candidate.
[03:05:23.772 --> 03:05:31.434]  In other news, only 6% of people trust the mainstream media, putting the industry about equal to Congress and well below the public's view of other organizations.
[03:05:31.434 --> 03:05:36.256]  This lack of confidence in establishment media is fueled by inaccuracies in reporting and deceptive bias.
[03:05:36.576 --> 03:05:45.925]  Another study revealed that only 45% of Americans, over 77 million, will not pay an income tax this year because they have no taxable income or they received enough tax breaks to raise their liability.
[03:05:45.925 --> 03:05:48.547]  This says a lot about the current decline of the economy.
[03:05:48.547 --> 03:05:54.372]  You'd expect less tax revenue as more Americans leave the job market or stay underemployed at part-time jobs.

[03:05:59.304 --> 03:05:59.964]  Uh, yeah.

[03:06:07.726 --> 03:06:08.486]  They work.
[03:06:08.486 --> 03:06:09.306]  Buy them, folks.
[03:06:09.306 --> 03:06:09.806]  Thank you, brother.
[03:06:09.806 --> 03:06:12.046]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[03:06:12.046 --> 03:06:17.948]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[03:06:17.948 --> 03:06:19.928]  Welcome to the Info War.

[03:06:30.272 --> 03:06:31.192]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:06:31.192 --> 03:06:32.233]  Have they worked for you?
[03:06:32.233 --> 03:06:35.095]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[03:06:35.095 --> 03:06:36.416]  What products are you taking?
[03:06:36.416 --> 03:06:44.461]  Everything from, uh, Super Male to, uh, Brain Force to Winter Sun, uh, X2, even got a little, uh, DNA Force.
[03:06:44.461 --> 03:06:47.923]  So, and I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.

[03:07:54.577 --> 03:07:55.258]  Another world.
[03:07:55.258 --> 03:07:56.039]  Another time.
[03:07:56.039 --> 03:07:57.139]  In the age of wonder.
[03:08:27.752 --> 03:08:32.375]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:32.375 --> 03:08:38.499]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:40.504 --> 03:08:40.985]  We are back.
[03:08:40.985 --> 03:08:43.387]  It's the 4th Hour Overdrive of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:43.387 --> 03:08:53.916]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson, and while Americans are still talking about Kobe Bryant, the elite are preparing for complete bedlam and mayhem.
[03:08:53.916 --> 03:09:01.762]  Of course, we had the report last week surrounding the company that's building luxury underground bunkers for the ultra-wealthy.
[03:09:02.443 --> 03:09:09.430]  To quote, protect high net worth individuals from the general public, that's you and me.
[03:09:09.430 --> 03:09:14.636]  Does that mean that, you know, mass civil unrest is going to happen next week, next month, even next year?
[03:09:14.636 --> 03:09:15.577]  No.
[03:09:15.577 --> 03:09:19.120]  But it tells us that the elite are preparing for something big.
[03:09:19.781 --> 03:09:38.911]  They see this global political awakening that Zbigniew Brzezinski talked about years ago, they see it going hot, they see it going violent all around the world and even in the West, which is why, you know, as of last year we had the news story about the elite buying strips of land, remote property, in New Zealand.
[03:09:38.911 --> 03:09:43.193]  That came out of the Davos Economic Forum last January, January 2015.
[03:09:45.470 --> 03:09:56.835]  And members of the elite were asked why they were doing this, and they said basically, well, we're afraid of Ferguson-style riots and mass civil unrest arising in the West.
[03:09:56.835 --> 03:10:03.398]  And of course, with this rising wealth inequality, it makes that kind of social disorder more likely.
[03:10:03.398 --> 03:10:07.940]  So we've got this huge story which just went up on Infowars.com about an hour ago.
[03:10:08.857 --> 03:10:14.700]  Top insurer warns global civil unrest could go viral.
[03:10:14.700 --> 03:10:16.101]  That's not Alex Jones saying that.
[03:10:16.101 --> 03:10:17.842]  That's not me saying that.
[03:10:17.842 --> 03:10:29.708]  It's Lloyds, one of the biggest insurers in the world, warning that a quote pandemic of global civil unrest could go viral, threatening international stability.
[03:10:29.708 --> 03:10:34.151]  This is a report that's being sent out to the mega wealthy, just come out today.
[03:10:35.635 --> 03:10:47.618]  It was commissioned... Lloyds commissioned leading risk management consultancy, the Risk Advisory Group, to produce a report analysing what factors could prompt the spread of civil unrest around the world.
[03:10:47.618 --> 03:10:57.420]  The report found that, quote, instances of political violence contagion are becoming more frequent, and the contagion effects ever more rapid and powerful.
[03:10:58.226 --> 03:11:13.417]  With the head of Exposure Management and Reinsurance, Trevor Maynard, warning that global outbreaks of violence are increasingly likely to develop into, quote, pandemics, that's their word, pandemics of civil unrest.
[03:11:13.417 --> 03:11:22.003]  They're talking about a transformation which will lead to, quote, widespread disruption, yet prove extremely difficult to anticipate.
[03:11:23.280 --> 03:11:24.961]  So this is going to go global.
[03:11:24.961 --> 03:11:27.443]  They talk about jihadists in the Middle East.
[03:11:27.443 --> 03:11:31.206]  They talk about the Arab Spring and they kind of tie the two together.
[03:11:31.206 --> 03:11:44.275]  Of course, we've also had reports about crack US troops being repositioned in major cities around the world for this very express purpose to deal with mass civil unrest.
[03:11:44.275 --> 03:11:47.858]  We already see it happening in places like Brazil.
[03:11:47.858 --> 03:11:50.740]  We've seen it in Japan, Hong Kong over the past couple of years.
[03:11:51.460 --> 03:12:18.488]  And of course we're seeing it in Europe, we're seeing warnings of civil war from the head of the Swiss army, the head of the Norwegian police, prominent people in Sweden, prominent security experts in Germany and France, warning those national governments that this migrant crisis which is being created by the elite, their policies led to it, will lead to a clash of civilizations, whether that turns out to be
[03:12:19.048 --> 03:12:21.369]  You know, some Holocaust remains to be seen.
[03:12:21.369 --> 03:12:32.093]  Obviously that's very unlikely, but they say the middle class, as a result of being censored and lectured all day about being racist, if they so much as criticize this migrant issue,
[03:12:33.115 --> 03:12:54.609]  is becoming quote radicalized and that's going to lead to a clash with these millions of migrants they're bringing in who are already rioting with each other as we will get on to shortly but this is a huge report again Lloyd's one of the top insurers in the world is saying that nobody has adequately prepared for this mass civil unrest that's coming
[03:12:56.152 --> 03:12:58.773]  We've had the story about the elite buying bunkers again.
[03:12:58.773 --> 03:13:02.415]  It doesn't mean that absolute mayhem is going to happen tomorrow.
[03:13:02.415 --> 03:13:14.642]  But they, again, cite the reason why they're buying these, you know, luxury survival bunkers is not only civil unrest, the prospect for social disorder, but also natural disasters.
[03:13:14.642 --> 03:13:20.865]  We see what's going on in Japan, where there's been a spate of earthquakes, also an earthquake in Ecuador,
[03:13:22.020 --> 03:13:26.403]  And people genuinely worried about what could happen next in terms of natural disasters.
[03:13:26.403 --> 03:13:39.213]  And that is another reason cited as to why the elite are buying these secure underground luxury bunkers in safe locations away from these potential disaster zones.
[03:13:40.191 --> 03:13:42.772]  So again, the elite are getting prepared.
[03:13:42.772 --> 03:14:02.137]  Whenever, you know, preppers are in the news, whenever National Geographic does a series about preppers, they're ridiculed, they're lambasted as kooks, as freaks, and yet we have the global elite, the mega-rich, doing exactly the same thing, but on an even bigger level.
[03:14:02.137 --> 03:14:07.219]  I mean, they're talking about, you know, 4,000 square foot underground luxury apartments.
[03:14:08.134 --> 03:14:16.542]  But you know, Bubba in Idaho is the kook for having his little 12 foot by 10 foot bomb shelter.
[03:14:16.542 --> 03:14:24.549]  So again, this whole narrative that preppers are insane, they're crazy, they're paranoid, and yet the elite is doing the exact same thing, only on a bigger level.
[03:14:25.987 --> 03:14:27.509]  So this is a huge report.
[03:14:27.509 --> 03:14:28.470]  Get this article out.
[03:14:28.470 --> 03:14:28.830]  Share it.
[03:14:28.830 --> 03:14:38.059]  Of course it ties in with the report we had last week out of the Chicago Tribune which was about how millionaires were fleeing the city of Chicago.
[03:14:39.048 --> 03:14:42.729]  Again, in line with what's happening in major cities in Europe.
[03:14:42.729 --> 03:14:47.470]  Paris and Rome are also seeing a mass exodus of millionaires.
[03:14:47.470 --> 03:14:57.933]  We have wealthy elites in New York City and other major American cities installing panic rooms into their big city apartments because, again, they fear civil unrest.
[03:14:57.933 --> 03:15:05.775]  They fear race riots which have been exacerbated by these violent radical leftists like Black Lives Matter.
[03:15:07.247 --> 03:15:14.972]  Buying land strips, buying remote houses in New Zealand, whether it's going to happen or not, they're going to be prepared for it.
[03:15:14.972 --> 03:15:23.938]  So if anyone lectures you about how paranoid and kooky you are about buying, you know, three, six months worth of storable food just in case,
[03:15:24.861 --> 03:15:27.643]  Then throw this back in their face.
[03:15:27.643 --> 03:15:30.565]  The global mega-rich are preparing for this.
[03:15:30.565 --> 03:15:33.327]  They're spending tens of millions of dollars.
[03:15:33.327 --> 03:15:38.691]  I mean, the elite in London, where I live, have stopped buying high-end luxury properties.
[03:15:38.691 --> 03:15:41.994]  They're down in some areas 33% over the past couple of years.
[03:15:43.875 --> 03:15:48.796]  All the mega-rich in London and other European cities are going back to renting.
[03:15:48.796 --> 03:15:56.297]  Because again, they're getting an inkling of this global economic collapse, this second downturn that's just around the corner.
[03:15:56.297 --> 03:16:01.358]  So they're making financial moves, they're making practical moves to prepare for this.
[03:16:01.358 --> 03:16:08.199]  Again, while the general public is laughed at for having three months worth of storable food and a water filter.
[03:16:08.199 --> 03:16:09.799]  Now let's look at what's happening in Belgium.
[03:16:09.799 --> 03:16:12.920]  Of course, we had the Brussels attacks back a few weeks ago.
[03:16:13.973 --> 03:16:16.138]  This is out of RT.
[03:16:16.138 --> 03:16:18.142]  Many danced after attacks.
[03:16:18.142 --> 03:16:21.188]  Muslim integration failure caused cancer.
[03:16:22.062 --> 03:16:24.583]  That's not Tommy Robinson saying that.
[03:16:24.583 --> 03:16:26.583]  That's not Paul Joseph Watson saying that.
[03:16:26.583 --> 03:16:28.724]  That's not Stefan Molyneux saying that.
[03:16:28.724 --> 03:16:31.865]  That's the Belgian Interior Minister.
[03:16:31.865 --> 03:16:48.169]  Belgium's integration policy has caused a cancer within Muslim communities, many of whom, quote, danced after the deadly Brussels attacks last month, said the Belgian Interior Minister, blaming the government for failing to integrate migrants into society.
[03:16:48.993 --> 03:17:06.529]  Now we go back to the ISIS manifesto from a few months ago, where they said, we're going to exploit this refugee wave to infiltrate migrants, create more of these radicalised ghettos, arm them and use them as sleeper cells to carry out further terror attacks in Europe.
[03:17:07.250 --> 03:17:14.532]  Of course we had the raid on Abdeslam, one of the assailants involved in the Paris Massacre.
[03:17:14.532 --> 03:17:19.513]  How was he able to hide away in Molenbeek for a period of over three months?
[03:17:19.513 --> 03:17:27.155]  Because he was supported by a network of friends and neighbours who advocated his goals.
[03:17:27.155 --> 03:17:31.776]  After he'd been involved in the massacre of over 200 people in Paris.
[03:17:31.776 --> 03:17:35.717]  After he had been involved in plotting the Brussels Massacre.
[03:17:36.596 --> 03:17:40.941]  Again, this is a network of Islamists that surround the jihadists.
[03:17:40.941 --> 03:17:45.547]  So no, it's not a tiny proportion of Muslims who are the problem.
[03:17:45.547 --> 03:17:48.290]  It's a significant percentage.
[03:17:48.290 --> 03:17:52.435]  As we saw with the poll last week, which caused a lot of controversy in the UK,
[03:17:53.396 --> 03:18:10.925]  There was a program on Channel 4 called What Muslims Really Think, and again, it simply restated the facts that I've stated over and over again, that many of them, in some cases a majority, have completely intolerant beliefs that are incompatible with Western secular liberal societies.
[03:18:10.925 --> 03:18:13.226]  And now that has manifested itself in Belgium,
[03:18:14.349 --> 03:18:31.362]  With them actually celebrating, dancing on the streets, people being blown apart, limbs being scattered everywhere in Belgium, in Brussels airport, in the metro station, you know, dozens of people dead, dozens more injured.
[03:18:31.362 --> 03:18:33.504]  Belgian Muslims were on the streets celebrating.
[03:18:33.504 --> 03:18:36.346]  You had children in classrooms celebrating.
[03:18:36.889 --> 03:18:46.756]  Just like after 9-11, even though the media called it a conspiracy theory when Trump brought it up, there were people, there were Muslims in New Jersey celebrating 9-11.
[03:18:46.756 --> 03:18:49.418]  Multiple anecdotal reports.
[03:18:49.418 --> 03:18:56.402]  We had people on the radio the same day saying they drove past Muslim areas, saw them high-fiving, saw them celebrating.
[03:18:57.663 --> 03:19:08.653]  Trump mentions it and the media claims it's a huge conspiracy theory even though it was documented at the time and then subsequently more people came out and said that yes, they saw the same thing.
[03:19:10.017 --> 03:19:27.070]  In an interview with a Belgian newspaper, Jan Bon said that he regretted that a significant proportion of the Muslim community had been, quote, dancing in the streets following the attacks on March 22nd, which 32 innocent victims and three suicide bombers were killed and over 300 people injured.
[03:19:29.252 --> 03:19:39.017]  And of course, it was the Mayor of Molenbeek that was handed a list of jihadists and Islamists by the police, who said, this is a major problem, it's going to lead to an attack, what are you going to do about it?
[03:19:39.017 --> 03:19:44.439]  She basically bowed to political correctness and said, I can't do anything about it, this isn't my job.
[03:19:44.439 --> 03:19:51.283]  And of course, several of the people on that list went on to take part in the Paris Massacre.
[03:19:51.283 --> 03:19:54.064]  We'll be back with more news after the break.
[03:19:54.064 --> 03:19:56.665]  This is the Alex Jones Show 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:19:56.665 --> 03:19:57.786]  Stay right there, we'll be back.
[03:19:59.446 --> 03:20:04.268]  Wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, a crashing economy.
[03:20:04.268 --> 03:20:05.369]  Are you ready?
[03:20:05.369 --> 03:20:08.150]  At best, your local stores have a three-day supply of food.
[03:20:08.150 --> 03:20:10.512]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?
[03:20:10.512 --> 03:20:14.293]  Are you willing to gamble your family's safety that it'll never happen to you?
[03:20:14.293 --> 03:20:19.376]  Be wise and be ready with 25-Year Shelf Life Wise Food Storage.

[03:21:07.942 --> 03:21:08.542]  Attention!
[03:21:08.542 --> 03:21:14.587]  If you or a loved one had a medical procedure to prevent blood clots from traveling to the heart or brain, please stand by for a very important message.
[03:21:14.587 --> 03:21:18.350]  IVC filters are commonly inserted to prevent blood clots from traveling to the heart or lungs.
[03:21:18.610 --> 03:21:26.496]  But now the FDA warns that these IBC filters may cause serious complications such as heart damage, lung damage, danger from rupture, internal bleeding, even death.
[03:21:26.496 --> 03:21:29.378]  You could be entitled to a cash settlement, but you must call now.

[03:21:47.591 --> 03:21:48.953]  Time is limited for these claims.
[03:21:48.953 --> 03:21:51.395]  Call for a free evaluation of your case.
[03:21:51.395 --> 03:21:52.996]  It's urgent that you act soon.

[03:21:53.257 --> 03:21:53.317]  1-800-933-7789.
[03:22:02.304 --> 03:22:09.728]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a SelectQuote agent with a true story of how SelectQuote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[03:22:09.728 --> 03:22:13.330]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:22:13.330 --> 03:22:17.032]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:22:17.692 --> 03:22:19.493]  I said, let me see.
[03:22:19.493 --> 03:22:30.582]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:22:30.582 --> 03:22:41.710]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[03:22:42.662 --> 03:22:43.662]  How about you?

[03:22:45.123 --> 03:22:45.363]  That's 1-800-654-1632.
[03:22:45.363 --> 03:22:45.463]  1-800-654-1632.

[03:22:46.243 --> 03:22:46.644]  We shop.
[03:22:46.644 --> 03:22:46.844]  You save.
[03:22:46.844 --> 03:22:48.344]  This is not an offering to sell a franchise.
[03:22:48.344 --> 03:22:51.005]  Franchise offerings are made through the Franchise Disclosure Document.
[03:23:03.573 --> 03:23:07.155]  Are you one of the 70% of Americans who hate their jobs?
[03:23:07.155 --> 03:23:09.796]  Do you wish you could work for yourself but don't know what to do?
[03:23:09.796 --> 03:23:11.597]  Then we have a proven solution for you.
[03:23:11.597 --> 03:23:14.279]  A budget-blinds franchise opportunity.
[03:23:14.279 --> 03:23:21.803]  Our franchise owners enjoy freedom and flexibility as well as the unlimited income potential of owning their own home-based business.
[03:23:21.803 --> 03:23:25.685]  And right now you have the opportunity to join our low-investment franchise network.
[03:23:26.005 --> 03:23:26.285]  I think so.
[03:23:55.985 --> 03:23:56.266]  We good.
[03:24:12.998 --> 03:24:21.242]  We are back for the Alex Jones Show fourth hour.
[03:24:21.242 --> 03:24:29.545]  Overdrive and the Belgium Interior Minister has said the blindingly obvious that Muslim migrants aren't integrating into society.
[03:24:29.545 --> 03:24:31.906]  Forget the millions of new arrivals.
[03:24:31.906 --> 03:24:35.188]  These are people who have been there for years and years.
[03:24:35.908 --> 03:24:40.113]  They were dancing on the streets when the Brussels attack happened.
[03:24:40.113 --> 03:24:50.944]  They were pelting the police with bottles and stones when they tried to arrest one of the individuals, Abdeslam, who was involved in the Paris massacre.
[03:24:50.944 --> 03:24:51.225]  Okay?
[03:24:51.225 --> 03:24:53.647]  It's not a tiny, fringe minority.
[03:24:53.647 --> 03:24:55.209]  This is a huge problem.
[03:24:55.209 --> 03:24:56.270]  And it's not a problem
[03:24:57.233 --> 03:25:00.494]  That Europe has with people coming in from other backgrounds.
[03:25:00.494 --> 03:25:02.795]  You know, there's a lot of Sikhs in the United Kingdom.
[03:25:02.795 --> 03:25:04.456]  There's a lot of Hindu people.
[03:25:04.456 --> 03:25:06.857]  We don't have this kind of problem.
[03:25:06.857 --> 03:25:12.980]  We don't have no-go areas where Hindus and Sikhs are pelting the police with bottles.
[03:25:12.980 --> 03:25:16.961]  You know, firefighters who try to put out fires are getting attacked.
[03:25:16.961 --> 03:25:18.062]  This is happening in France.
[03:25:18.062 --> 03:25:19.082]  It's happening in Sweden.
[03:25:19.082 --> 03:25:22.444]  They call it a conspiracy theory and yet the riots keep on happening.
[03:25:23.174 --> 03:25:26.795]  In fact, we had another one back at the end of last week.
[03:25:26.795 --> 03:25:31.737]  Shocking video shows hundreds of migrants brawling at Paris metro station.
[03:25:31.737 --> 03:25:40.880]  Two people have been seriously injured and a historic Paris metro station trashed after two massive brawls erupted between hundreds of migrants on Thursday night.
[03:25:42.096 --> 03:25:44.777]  And you can go and watch the video, it's in the article again.
[03:25:44.777 --> 03:25:46.638]  This is not the first time it's happened.
[03:25:46.638 --> 03:25:51.360]  It happens all the time at these migrant camps throughout Europe.
[03:25:51.360 --> 03:25:57.062]  And in many cases, the police, now, it's so common that they just refuse to go there.
[03:25:57.062 --> 03:25:59.583]  You have migrants raping young Muslim girls.
[03:25:59.583 --> 03:26:02.805]  You have migrants killing their own wives.
[03:26:02.805 --> 03:26:06.226]  And this is before they've even been let loose into the general society.
[03:26:06.226 --> 03:26:08.047]  This is what they do amongst each other.
[03:26:09.352 --> 03:26:11.093]  It's clearly not working.
[03:26:11.093 --> 03:26:14.755]  Dancing in the streets after the Brussels attacks.
[03:26:14.755 --> 03:26:19.218]  You know, I've talked about the statistics before, just in Belgium.
[03:26:19.218 --> 03:26:22.139]  Belgium, 6% Muslim population.
[03:26:22.139 --> 03:26:27.322]  The prison population of Belgium is 45% Muslim.
[03:26:27.322 --> 03:26:32.165]  That's how much they're over-represented in terms of criminal behavior.
[03:26:32.165 --> 03:26:34.366]  You can look at the welfare state.
[03:26:34.366 --> 03:26:35.707]  Again, you know, 6, 7, 8% Muslims in Sweden.
[03:26:39.127 --> 03:26:43.708]  Yet foreign immigrants represent the majority of welfare payments.
[03:26:43.708 --> 03:26:55.292]  So this crap they trot out again and again, that we need these waves of migrants to do jobs because, you know, we're dying out, we need this input of labour, simply not true.
[03:26:55.292 --> 03:26:57.133]  The majority of them go on welfare.
[03:26:58.644 --> 03:27:01.126]  800 million Muslims are illiterate.
[03:27:01.126 --> 03:27:04.068]  They can't even get to grips with their own language.
[03:27:04.068 --> 03:27:05.829]  How are they going to get to grips with ours?
[03:27:05.829 --> 03:27:07.430]  How are they going to assimilate?
[03:27:07.430 --> 03:27:12.933]  So we see more and more of this social unrest, these riots taking place.
[03:27:12.933 --> 03:27:15.175]  Then we have this article.
[03:27:15.175 --> 03:27:19.097]  Finnish migrants pose with pre-teen girlfriends on social media.
[03:27:19.097 --> 03:27:22.660]  Oh, another wonderful piece of cultural enrichment.
[03:27:23.502 --> 03:27:26.664]  Images have surfaced on the Finnish image board.
[03:27:26.664 --> 03:27:35.328]  Lia Luta of Finnish migrants and their pre-teen white girlfriends posing on Instagram and Facebook in the Finnish city of Saarjaavi.
[03:27:35.328 --> 03:27:46.694]  The men of Arab descent in their 20s to 40s are seen posing with the young girls with captions such as, beautiful, my baby, and I love you.
[03:27:46.694 --> 03:27:50.556]  And again, bearing in mind that these people follow a religion,
[03:27:51.966 --> 03:27:55.367]  In which Mohammed married a nine-year-old girl.
[03:27:55.367 --> 03:27:58.709]  Married a six-year-old girl, contemplated the marriage when she was nine.
[03:27:58.709 --> 03:28:00.630]  This is the background they come from.
[03:28:00.630 --> 03:28:02.951]  We have the mass rape in Cologne.
[03:28:02.951 --> 03:28:04.571]  Several other major European cities.
[03:28:04.571 --> 03:28:07.833]  We have children being attacked in these migrant camps.
[03:28:07.833 --> 03:28:12.215]  And now they're posing on social media with pre-teen girlfriends.
[03:28:12.215 --> 03:28:14.276]  Men as old as 40.
[03:28:14.276 --> 03:28:14.676]  And what's...
[03:28:15.828 --> 03:28:21.270]  Most shocking about this is that they asked the parents what the hell was going on.
[03:28:21.270 --> 03:28:29.734]  The parents of these pre-teen Finnish girls posing with Arab migrants who said they were their girlfriends.
[03:28:29.734 --> 03:28:34.796]  They went and asked the parents what was going on and they basically said, oh, they're just friends, it's no big deal.
[03:28:34.796 --> 03:28:42.780]  Some 40-year-old guys hanging out with your 11-year-old daughter calling her my baby and it's no big deal.
[03:28:43.885 --> 03:28:46.387]  These people are seriously deranged.
[03:28:46.387 --> 03:28:51.371]  I mean, if ever there's a need for child protective services, then this is it.
[03:28:51.371 --> 03:29:01.479]  Meanwhile, you know, they take away children from loving foster homes just because the foster parents supported UKIP, a political party that was anti-immigration.
[03:29:02.099 --> 03:29:11.787]  But it's perfectly fine to have your pre-teen daughter posing on social media with 40-year-old Arab men who call them my baby.
[03:29:11.787 --> 03:29:14.409]  I mean, how frigging sick is that?
[03:29:14.409 --> 03:29:18.192]  And the parents are just like, well, God forbid someone might call us racist.
[03:29:19.113 --> 03:29:27.776]  It's perfectly fine that some weird 40-year-old man who can barely speak English, you know, been in the country a few months, is hanging out with our 11-year-old daughter.
[03:29:27.776 --> 03:29:31.137]  I mean, I've never seen something this shocking.
[03:29:31.137 --> 03:29:32.037]  This is in Finland.
[03:29:32.037 --> 03:29:34.918]  It's also happening in Austria.
[03:29:34.918 --> 03:29:37.439]  Absolutely despicable.
[03:29:37.439 --> 03:29:39.159]  We'll get more into this after the break.
[03:29:39.159 --> 03:29:45.081]  We're also going to talk about the latest controversy with the North Carolina bathroom bill.
[03:29:45.081 --> 03:29:46.022]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:46.022 --> 03:29:47.102]  Keep it locked in.
[03:29:48.635 --> 03:29:52.557]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.557 --> 03:29:59.461]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.461 --> 03:30:02.203]  Today is Monday, April 18th, and here's some of the latest news.
[03:30:02.203 --> 03:30:06.645]  It's now known that the Colorado lawmakers who voted to scrap the state primary are in fact Ted Cruz delegates.
[03:30:06.645 --> 03:30:11.608]  Four state Republicans voted against a bill that would allow Colorado voters a chance to vote in a presidential primary.
[03:30:11.608 --> 03:30:16.031]  And all of them are Cruz supporters, with three of them listed as members of Cruz's Colorado leadership team.
[03:30:16.411 --> 03:30:23.956]  And one of them, Senator Kevin Grantham, even had the audacity to brag about Cruz's quote victory on Twitter despite the fact that the voters did not get to pick a candidate.
[03:30:23.956 --> 03:30:31.621]  In other news, only 6% of people trust the mainstream media, putting the industry about equal to Congress and well below the public's view of other organizations.
[03:30:31.621 --> 03:30:36.764]  This lack of confidence in establishment media is fueled by inaccuracies in reporting and deceptive bias.
[03:30:36.764 --> 03:30:38.525]  Another study revealed that only 45% of Americans, over 77 million,
[03:30:40.486 --> 03:30:46.113]  We're not paying income tax this year because they have no taxable income or they received enough tax breaks to raise their liability.
[03:30:46.113 --> 03:30:48.716]  This says a lot about the current decline of the economy.
[03:30:48.716 --> 03:30:54.564]  You'd expect less tax revenue as more Americans leave the job market or stay underemployed at part-time jobs.
[03:30:54.564 --> 03:30:57.147]  For more news and reports, visit InfoWars.com.

[03:32:07.802 --> 03:32:08.223]  We're good.
[03:32:29.073 --> 03:32:29.973]  Shower Filters.
[03:32:29.973 --> 03:32:31.714]  We're introducing the best yet.
[03:32:31.714 --> 03:32:35.776]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.

[03:33:14.039 --> 03:33:16.646]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:16.646 --> 03:33:21.658]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:33:26.903 --> 03:33:27.663]  We are back.
[03:33:27.663 --> 03:33:29.624]  It's 4th Hour Overdrive of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:29.624 --> 03:33:31.264]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:31.264 --> 03:33:41.366]  Now, of course, liberals continue to freak out over these bathroom bills that are either in the process of passing or have passed in several states.
[03:33:41.366 --> 03:33:45.827]  And, of course, the main battlefront is North Carolina.
[03:33:45.827 --> 03:33:54.869]  They passed a bill called HB2, which would, God forbid, require people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the gender they were born.
[03:33:55.549 --> 03:33:57.491]  Now this was a reaction.
[03:33:57.491 --> 03:34:15.571]  It was a defensive measure against an ordinance in Charlotte which would have forced private businesses to cater for transgender people and allow them to use whichever bathroom they like depending on which gender they identify on that particular day.
[03:34:16.272 --> 03:34:23.774]  So, this was a complete violation of the rights of private businesses, similar to what we've seen with Christian bakeries.
[03:34:23.774 --> 03:34:28.496]  Of course, we've had gay activists go out and try and ruin people's lives.
[03:34:28.496 --> 03:34:31.036]  This was a vindictive measure.
[03:34:31.036 --> 03:34:33.697]  It wasn't a random occurrence.
[03:34:33.697 --> 03:34:39.759]  In several examples where they go to a Christian bakery, ask for a gay wedding cake,
[03:34:40.765 --> 03:34:45.407]  And they're refused because the owners say, sorry, that doesn't accord with our beliefs.
[03:34:45.407 --> 03:34:46.707]  We politely reject.
[03:34:46.707 --> 03:34:49.488]  You know, we suggest you go somewhere else.
[03:34:49.488 --> 03:34:52.649]  Of course, Stephen Crowder did that in Michigan.
[03:34:52.649 --> 03:34:57.591]  He went to a bunch of Muslim-owned bakeries and asked for a gay wedding cake.
[03:34:58.231 --> 03:35:05.315]  They refused, but there was no national hounding campaign, there was no national scandal surrounding that.
[03:35:05.315 --> 03:35:11.257]  So again, it's one rule for one set of people and another rule for another set of people.
[03:35:11.257 --> 03:35:24.344]  So they passed this bill in North Carolina, there are similar bills in other states, and all it said was in public bathrooms you have to use bathroom which corresponds with your biological gender which is on your birth certificate.
[03:35:25.339 --> 03:35:39.031]  They said, if you're a private business, feel completely free to provide transgender bathrooms or to allow transgender-identifying people to use whichever bathroom they choose.
[03:35:39.031 --> 03:35:50.222]  So, in a sense, it was a defense of rights in terms of the majority, whereas the Charlotte Ordinance was a violation of people's rights to cater for a minority.
[03:35:50.782 --> 03:35:59.208]  Bearing in mind 0.03% of the US population identifies as transgender.
[03:35:59.208 --> 03:36:01.150]  A tiny minority.
[03:36:01.150 --> 03:36:03.812]  And the point I made in a video that I put out about this is...
[03:36:05.342 --> 03:36:15.671]  If you make the effort to look, if you're a man and you want to be a woman, and you make the effort to look like a woman, then nobody is even going to notice if you use the female bathroom.
[03:36:15.671 --> 03:36:21.355]  Of course, what this will do, and it's already had this effect in several cases which I talk about in the video,
[03:36:22.310 --> 03:36:28.432]  It basically, it's a loophole to allow perverts and freaks to go into women's bathrooms.
[03:36:28.432 --> 03:36:34.474]  And I'm not just saying that for effect, it already happened in Seattle, back a couple of months ago.
[03:36:34.474 --> 03:36:39.596]  There was a man who, quote, made no verbal or physical attempt to identify as a woman.
[03:36:39.596 --> 03:36:42.477]  You know, he didn't even make the effort to put on a wig.
[03:36:42.477 --> 03:36:46.739]  He walked into a female bathroom in Seattle and began to undress.
[03:36:48.064 --> 03:36:49.084]  As a man.
[03:36:49.084 --> 03:36:51.245]  He didn't even look like a woman.
[03:36:51.245 --> 03:36:54.585]  But again, he cited the law.
[03:36:54.585 --> 03:36:58.086]  Quote, the law has changed and I have a right to be here.
[03:36:58.086 --> 03:37:04.347]  That's what this hairy creep said as he walked into a women's bathroom and began to undress.
[03:37:04.347 --> 03:37:10.669]  So again, this is what this kind of ordinance that we saw in Charlotte is going to make more likely.
[03:37:10.669 --> 03:37:14.890]  It's basically a red carpet for perverts and pedophiles.
[03:37:14.890 --> 03:37:16.710]  You had the case in Colorado where
[03:37:17.898 --> 03:37:25.022]  Teen girls complained about a, quote, transgender student who kept entering the girls' changing room.
[03:37:25.022 --> 03:37:29.985]  They were threatened with hate crimes charges for doing so.
[03:37:29.985 --> 03:37:43.633]  So again, violating the privacy rights, violating the private business rights, the private religious rights of people, the majority to cater for this tiny, tiny minority, 0.03% of the population.
[03:37:46.886 --> 03:37:57.893]  You know, people like the guy who we featured a few months ago who left his wife and family to become a woman and now identifies as a six-year-old girl.
[03:37:57.893 --> 03:38:00.615]  And he's in the clip, you can go and watch the video.
[03:38:00.615 --> 03:38:07.940]  You know, if he identifies as a six-year-old girl, shouldn't he be allowed to use the children's playground?
[03:38:07.940 --> 03:38:12.803]  Shouldn't he be allowed to use the children's locker room?
[03:38:12.803 --> 03:38:14.344]  You know, a 55-year-old guy with a beard
[03:38:16.618 --> 03:38:23.003]  Doesn't really look much like a woman, but he identifies as a woman, and he also identifies as a six-year-old child.
[03:38:23.003 --> 03:38:25.404]  So are you committing hate speech?
[03:38:25.404 --> 03:38:35.912]  Are you violating his rights by saying that he, as a biological 55-year-old man, shouldn't be allowed to go into a children's locker room?
[03:38:35.912 --> 03:38:40.215]  This is the abuse that this is opening up, the potential for it.
[03:38:40.215 --> 03:38:41.596]  But it's no surprise, you know, given that
[03:38:42.506 --> 03:38:52.849]  The left is now beginning to hail, as we predicted all along, pedophilia as an alternative sexual lifestyle choice.
[03:38:52.849 --> 03:39:08.615]  They're actually giving pedophiles platforms on Salon.com to argue that they're just victims of right-wing bigotry and that their sexual preference should just be accepted in the same way that being gay is accepted.
[03:39:09.395 --> 03:39:20.363]  So it's no surprise that the left is really, again, laying down the red carpet for pedophiles, for perverts, to abuse this kind of situation.
[03:39:20.363 --> 03:39:25.087]  And then you have, of course, the virtue signaling on steroids that's taking place.
[03:39:25.087 --> 03:39:31.892]  You had Ringo Starr cancel a gig in North Carolina to protest against this bathroom bill.
[03:39:32.961 --> 03:39:39.025]  Now he didn't cancel a gig in Russia where they actually arrest gay people for protesting on the streets.
[03:39:39.025 --> 03:39:42.067]  Oh no, only in North Carolina.
[03:39:42.067 --> 03:39:50.593]  You had PayPal come out and say they were withdrawing plans for an operations center in North Carolina that would have employed 400 people.
[03:39:52.674 --> 03:40:08.007]  With the justification, quote, this is from the CEO, PayPal's Dan Schulman, the new law perpetuates discrimination and it violates the values and principles that are at the core of PayPal's mission and culture.
[03:40:08.007 --> 03:40:16.554]  That's what they said when they decided to pull this 400 people operations unit in North Carolina to protest against this bathroom bill.
[03:40:18.055 --> 03:40:20.416]  Again, citing their values and principles.
[03:40:20.416 --> 03:40:29.580]  Those values and principles don't get in the way of PayPal doing business in Saudi Arabia, a country that beheads homosexuals.
[03:40:29.580 --> 03:40:36.482]  The virtue signaling kind of disappears when it comes to Middle Eastern countries, of course, because they can do no wrong.
[03:40:36.482 --> 03:40:44.866]  You had Coca-Cola, Starbucks, Microsoft, Google, all signing this letter decrying the North Carolina bill.
[03:40:44.866 --> 03:40:47.327]  Yet they all do business in Kuwait.
[03:40:48.476 --> 03:40:53.524]  Where cross-dressing is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
[03:40:54.670 --> 03:40:58.132]  They didn't sign off on a letter condemning Q8.
[03:40:58.132 --> 03:41:08.860]  No, they only signed off on a letter condemning North Carolina, because again, God forbid, people will have to use the bathroom that correlates with their biological gender.
[03:41:08.860 --> 03:41:14.824]  Cirque du Soleil, they've cancelled shows in North Carolina over this bathroom bill.
[03:41:14.824 --> 03:41:22.370]  They haven't cancelled shows in Dubai, where being transgender is illegal, where people go to prison for this.
[03:41:23.356 --> 03:41:30.448]  But again, there's no virtue signalling when it comes to Dubai, because of course that's a vastly more lucrative market.
[03:41:31.923 --> 03:41:34.164]  These companies have no principles whatsoever.
[03:41:34.164 --> 03:41:37.165]  This is all about virtue signaling.
[03:41:37.165 --> 03:41:38.405]  But I go back to the point.
[03:41:38.405 --> 03:41:40.246]  This has nothing to do with human rights.
[03:41:40.246 --> 03:41:58.432]  This was a defensive measure against an ordinance which, if it would have, you know, taken effect and become a pretext for the rest of the state, would have forced private businesses to adhere to this rule of allowing people who identify as transgender to use whichever bathroom they liked.
[03:41:58.792 --> 03:42:13.460]  Now I don't care if you identify as Barney the Purple Dinosaur, but when government conspires to violate the rights of the majority to be politically correct and please a tiny minority, that's a huge problem.
[03:42:14.571 --> 03:42:22.715]  You don't let people who identify as six-year-old girls when they're 55-year-old men use children's changing rooms.
[03:42:22.715 --> 03:42:32.200]  So why should you allow people who, maybe on a whim, identify as being female, even though they're male, use the female locker room?
[03:42:32.200 --> 03:42:34.421]  Now we're going to go to this video which ties into this.
[03:42:35.629 --> 03:42:40.574]  This is by YouTuber JoeySalads who we featured on InfoWars.com before.
[03:42:40.574 --> 03:42:47.061]  He does these social experiments where he puts these, you know, liberal, sacred cows to the test.
[03:42:47.884 --> 03:42:56.431]  He did one a couple of weeks ago where he went out and tried to ascertain who was the most violent Trump supporters or Bernie Sanders supporters.
[03:42:56.431 --> 03:43:09.843]  Of course he ended up getting physically attacked by Bernie Sanders supporters because they're vile, intolerant, hateful people as our reporters have proven over and over again in Portland, New York and other areas over the past couple of weeks.
[03:43:09.843 --> 03:43:15.047]  So he basically went out and did a video testing this bathroom bill and now for
[03:43:15.953 --> 03:43:18.254]  You know, people listening on the radio who've only got the audio.
[03:43:18.254 --> 03:43:36.599]  He basically just dressed up as a woman and followed women into female bathrooms to get their reaction, their organic, natural reaction, to a guy with facial hair who is dressed up as a woman following them into the female bathroom.
[03:43:36.599 --> 03:43:37.740]  This is a four minute clip.
[03:43:37.740 --> 03:43:38.120]  Here it is.
[03:43:39.266 --> 03:43:39.867]  What's up, guys?
[03:43:39.867 --> 03:43:40.847]  Joey Salads here.
[03:43:40.847 --> 03:43:47.493]  In North Carolina, I passed a bill that requires trans people to use the bathrooms that correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificate.
[03:43:47.493 --> 03:43:52.618]  I reached out to a trans friend of mine and a doctor who I'm also friends with, and both had some contradicting points.
[03:43:52.618 --> 03:44:01.586]  My trans friend told me that nobody is born to a sex or a gender, and that gender and sex are a social construct, and that DNA and genetics have nothing to do with your sex.
[03:44:01.586 --> 03:44:06.330]  My doctor said that DNA and genetics have everything to do with your gender at birth.
[03:44:06.510 --> 03:44:09.775]  Alright guys, so I'm about to make my transformation to look like a transgender.
[03:44:22.774 --> 03:44:27.720]  Now I know that dressing up like a girl doesn't necessarily make me transgender.
[03:44:27.720 --> 03:44:30.043]  It would just make me a cross-dresser.
[03:44:30.043 --> 03:44:33.907]  But on the outside, people will still think that I'm transgender.
[03:44:33.907 --> 03:44:39.834]  I got this information from my transgender friend and it is transgender approved.
[03:44:39.834 --> 03:44:41.376]  How do I look?
[03:44:41.376 --> 03:44:42.857]  Oh my god.
[03:44:42.857 --> 03:44:43.158]  Joe?
[03:44:44.585 --> 03:44:47.329]  You look fabulous.
[03:44:47.329 --> 03:44:57.182]  I got my transgender friend on the phone, and I'm gonna see what they think about my dress, so... It looks so great right now, oh my gosh.
[03:44:57.182 --> 03:44:58.584]  Does it look good?
[03:44:58.584 --> 03:45:00.767]  Is it transgender approved?
[03:45:04.546 --> 03:45:05.346]  Alright.
[03:45:05.346 --> 03:45:11.709]  I also found out through the transgender community that some of them actually keep their voice the same way.
[03:45:11.709 --> 03:45:16.992]  So, going through the requirement checklist, penis, you're allowed to have.
[03:45:16.992 --> 03:45:19.033]  Voice, you're allowed to have.
[03:45:19.033 --> 03:45:25.176]  Technically speaking, I would be considered somebody just starting their transgender transformation.
[03:45:25.176 --> 03:45:27.957]  Let's go into some girls' bedrooms and see what they think.
[03:45:33.934 --> 03:45:35.335]  What are you doing?
[03:45:35.335 --> 03:45:36.576]  I'm transgender.
[03:45:36.576 --> 03:45:36.997]  What?
[03:45:36.997 --> 03:45:38.538]  No, you can't be in here.
[03:45:38.538 --> 03:45:39.499]  This is a girl's bathroom.
[03:45:39.499 --> 03:45:40.560]  I identify as a girl.
[03:45:40.560 --> 03:45:42.261]  You are not- Do you hear yourself right now?
[03:45:42.261 --> 03:45:43.483]  You are not a woman.
[03:45:43.483 --> 03:45:46.145]  You have such- I am a girl.
[03:45:46.145 --> 03:45:49.448]  Transgender, we could stay with our regular voice.
[03:45:49.448 --> 03:45:50.249]  What?
[03:45:50.249 --> 03:45:51.269]  That doesn't make any sense!
[03:45:51.269 --> 03:45:52.631]  You definitely have a penis.
[03:45:52.631 --> 03:45:53.792]  You need to get out of here.
[03:45:53.792 --> 03:45:56.714]  I do have a penis, but I identify as a girl, so I'm allowed in here.
[03:45:56.714 --> 03:45:57.495]  You can't be in here.
[03:45:57.495 --> 03:45:58.035]  Why not?
[03:45:58.035 --> 03:45:58.696]  I'm a girl.
[03:45:58.696 --> 03:46:00.037]  No, you can't be in here.
[03:46:00.037 --> 03:46:00.698]  But I'm a girl.
[03:46:02.082 --> 03:46:03.543]  You can't just say you're a girl!
[03:46:03.543 --> 03:46:05.823]  I can't just say I'm a guy!
[03:46:05.823 --> 03:46:06.464]  I'll get out.
[03:46:06.464 --> 03:46:08.004]  I'll let you be.
[03:46:08.004 --> 03:46:10.045]  Ew, get out!
[03:46:10.045 --> 03:46:14.287]  What are you doing here?
[03:46:14.287 --> 03:46:16.928]  You're not supposed to be in here!
[03:46:16.928 --> 03:46:18.188]  I'm trans.
[03:46:18.188 --> 03:46:19.229]  You're a guy!
[03:46:19.229 --> 03:46:20.689]  Get out of here!
[03:46:20.689 --> 03:46:22.590]  But I identify as a girl, why can't I be in here?
[03:46:22.590 --> 03:46:23.390]  Ew, this is disgusting!
[03:46:23.390 --> 03:46:24.491]  Get the f*** out of here!
[03:46:24.491 --> 03:46:25.331]  We need to leave.
[03:46:25.331 --> 03:46:27.312]  Okay, okay.
[03:46:27.312 --> 03:46:27.852]  Okay.
[03:46:32.935 --> 03:46:33.596]  Hello.
[03:46:33.596 --> 03:46:35.117]  Oh, hi.
[03:46:35.117 --> 03:46:37.338]  How are you?
[03:46:37.338 --> 03:46:37.839]  Good.
[03:46:37.839 --> 03:46:40.060]  Are you transgender?
[03:46:40.060 --> 03:46:41.281]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:46:41.281 --> 03:46:42.462]  Oh, good for you.
[03:46:42.462 --> 03:46:43.183]  Thanks.
[03:46:43.183 --> 03:46:45.645]  How long have you been transgender for?
[03:46:45.645 --> 03:46:47.826]  Just started like a couple days ago.
[03:46:47.826 --> 03:46:48.927]  Oh.
[03:46:48.927 --> 03:46:49.607]  Yeah.
[03:46:49.607 --> 03:46:51.989]  That's a short amount of time.
[03:46:51.989 --> 03:46:52.370]  Do you have to pee?
[03:46:52.370 --> 03:46:53.210]  Oh, yeah.
[03:46:53.210 --> 03:46:53.831]  Yeah, I gotta go.
[03:46:53.831 --> 03:46:55.212]  I'm gonna go right now.
[03:46:55.212 --> 03:46:56.553]  Go ahead.
[03:46:56.553 --> 03:46:59.435]  Hey.
[03:47:02.395 --> 03:47:02.615]  Get out!
[03:47:02.615 --> 03:47:03.476]  Get out!
[03:47:03.476 --> 03:47:04.538]  What are you doing in here?
[03:47:04.538 --> 03:47:05.459]  I'm transgender.
[03:47:05.459 --> 03:47:06.460]  What are you doing in here?
[03:47:06.460 --> 03:47:06.941]  I'm transgender.
[03:47:06.941 --> 03:47:07.401]  I'm a girl.
[03:47:07.401 --> 03:47:07.822]  Get out.
[03:47:07.822 --> 03:47:08.202]  No, no, no.
[03:47:08.202 --> 03:47:08.462]  Get out.
[03:47:08.462 --> 03:47:08.863]  I'm a girl.
[03:47:08.863 --> 03:47:09.304]  No, get out.
[03:47:09.304 --> 03:47:09.564]  Why?
[03:47:09.564 --> 03:47:10.565]  This is not okay.
[03:47:10.565 --> 03:47:11.226]  It's not okay.
[03:47:11.226 --> 03:47:11.807]  I'm a girl.
[03:47:11.807 --> 03:47:12.367]  No, you're not.
[03:47:12.367 --> 03:47:13.509]  You're not a girl.
[03:47:13.509 --> 03:47:14.450]  You're not a girl.
[03:47:17.011 --> 03:47:17.852]  Thank you guys for watching.
[03:47:17.852 --> 03:47:19.893]  Please give this video a like, share, and subscribe.
[03:47:19.893 --> 03:47:26.338]  And as you can tell from this video that most women are not comfortable sharing a bathroom with a trans person.
[03:47:26.338 --> 03:47:34.864]  There has to be another solution for this debate because women are not comfortable sharing a bathroom and trans people want to share the bathroom.
[03:47:34.864 --> 03:47:36.245]  So there needs to be a better solution.
[03:47:36.245 --> 03:47:38.707]  Comment below what you think the solution needs to be.
[03:47:38.707 --> 03:47:40.368]  Do you think that trans people should be allowed?
[03:47:40.828 --> 03:47:41.809]  Tell you the truth.
[03:47:41.809 --> 03:47:42.890]  Okay, and that was in Hollywood.
[03:47:56.980 --> 03:48:04.027]  So that's how liberal women react to transgender men going into the female bathroom.
[03:48:04.027 --> 03:48:18.480]  So they're going to virtue signal about it all day in opposing this North Carolina bathroom bill, but when it's actually put to the test and a guy with a wig walks into the female bathroom, that is how they react.
[03:48:18.480 --> 03:48:19.842]  Very telling, but of course,
[03:48:21.052 --> 03:48:30.800]  You know, that's being transphobic, but the Christian bakery whose business was destroyed because it refused to make a gay wedding cake, they're bad.
[03:48:30.800 --> 03:48:36.425]  Even though, you know, Steven Crowder went and did the same experiment with Muslim bakeries, they refused to make the cake.
[03:48:37.145 --> 03:48:38.605]  And again, nothing happened.
[03:48:38.605 --> 03:48:43.167]  So again, that video by Joey Salads, which is an exclusive, he gave it to us first.
[03:48:43.167 --> 03:48:45.588]  It's going up on YouTube in a moment.
[03:48:45.588 --> 03:48:54.650]  Again, proves that when liberals react to a man walking into a woman's bathroom, that's the natural organic reaction you're going to get.
[03:48:54.650 --> 03:48:59.992]  And that's what's going to happen if these ordinances like the one in Charlotte are passed.
[03:49:00.692 --> 03:49:07.457]  So again, given that evidence, the North Carolina bathroom bill makes perfect sense.
[03:49:07.457 --> 03:49:10.379]  And you can go watch my video about it.
[03:49:10.379 --> 03:49:16.604]  It's linked from the Alex Jones Channel, about this transgender bathroom controversy.
[03:49:16.604 --> 03:49:19.546]  Let's get back into some more news now.
[03:49:19.546 --> 03:49:26.852]  Of course, before the previous segment, I was talking about Muslims in Brussels who were dancing on the streets celebrating the Brussels attack.
[03:49:27.878 --> 03:49:40.224]  Then we have this article out of Breitbart, UK equalities chief who popularised the term Islamophobia admits, I never thought Muslims would blend, I thought Muslims would blend into Britain, I should have known better.
[03:49:40.224 --> 03:49:51.090]  And of course this is off the back of a Channel 4 programme which caused quite a stir here in the UK, people said it was Islamophobic, I watched it, it wasn't, it was completely tame.
[03:49:52.085 --> 03:49:55.567]  Most of the people interviewed in the program were Muslims.
[03:49:55.567 --> 03:49:59.669]  Most of the people speaking out about this were Muslim reformists.
[03:49:59.669 --> 03:50:14.076]  And again it revealed that Muslims share a lot of these intolerant attitudes, which are completely intolerant, towards homosexuals, towards transgenders, completely incompatible with Western ideals of liberalism.
[03:50:14.076 --> 03:50:17.158]  And that's what leads to these ghettos, that's what leads to
[03:50:18.078 --> 03:50:26.226]  People protecting Abdeslam, the Paris massacre assailant, because, again, it's concentric rings.
[03:50:26.226 --> 03:50:27.848]  It's not just jihadists.
[03:50:27.848 --> 03:50:31.111]  It's Islamists who protect this ideology.
[03:50:31.111 --> 03:50:33.754]  This integration hasn't worked.
[03:50:33.754 --> 03:50:37.277]  Bringing in millions more of these people won't work.
[03:50:37.277 --> 03:50:39.119]  It will only lead to mass civil unrest.
[03:50:40.280 --> 03:50:46.383]  London preacher and friend hail fanatic who killed politician in Pakistan as hero and martyr.
[03:50:46.383 --> 03:50:47.724]  Yet another example.
[03:50:47.724 --> 03:50:55.788]  This guy who defended liberal values in Pakistan was murdered and his death is being celebrated by quote moderate Muslims everywhere.
[03:50:55.788 --> 03:50:57.269]  We'll be back in the final segment.
[03:50:57.269 --> 03:50:58.810]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[03:50:58.810 --> 03:50:59.250]  Stay tuned.
[03:51:00.188 --> 03:51:02.169]  My name is Don Whiskin.
[03:51:02.169 --> 03:51:07.132]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:07.132 --> 03:51:11.134]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:51:11.134 --> 03:51:12.695]  He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:12.695 --> 03:51:16.777]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:51:16.777 --> 03:51:21.359]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:51:21.359 --> 03:51:22.200]  He waited too long.
[03:51:22.640 --> 03:51:26.001]  In June, that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:51:26.001 --> 03:51:26.882]  What did I do?
[03:51:26.882 --> 03:51:34.345]  I took a 7-herb formula I now call ExtendoVite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle, and valerian.
[03:51:34.345 --> 03:51:42.488]  Based on German studies of natural medicine, ExtendoVite is designed to clear blocked arteries, clean the toxins from your blood, and improve your immune system.

[03:52:59.295 --> 03:53:01.336]  Hello, I'm Michael Reagan.
[03:53:01.336 --> 03:53:14.260]  My father, President Ronald Reagan, believed so strongly in gold that he changed gold ownership forever by bringing back physical gold to the American public, allowing gold coins to be minted and sold to U.S.
[03:53:14.260 --> 03:53:16.701]  citizens just like you, starting in 1985.
[03:53:17.961 --> 03:53:24.883]  Gold ownership can help protect your financial future, especially when our national debt is spiraling out of control.
[03:53:24.883 --> 03:53:32.905]  Many smart Americans have kept their retirements from being wiped out during America's financial crisis thanks to physical gold coins.
[03:53:32.905 --> 03:53:35.566]  I strongly urge you to call the U.S.
[03:53:35.566 --> 03:53:36.826]  Money Reserve at 1-866-944-GOLD
[03:53:39.287 --> 03:53:42.210]  Or go online to usmoneyreserve.com.

[03:53:56.426 --> 03:53:57.627]  I'm Michael Reagan.
[03:53:57.627 --> 03:53:57.968]  Thank you.
[03:54:17.619 --> 03:54:20.703]  Welcome back to the final segment of the Alex Jones Show fourth hour.
[03:54:20.703 --> 03:54:23.126]  And the religion of peace has struck again.
[03:54:23.126 --> 03:54:27.812]  Associated Press reports Jerusalem bus bombing wounds 21 Israelis.
[03:54:27.812 --> 03:54:32.979]  The bus exploded in Jerusalem on Monday wounding at least 21 people in what police said was a terror attack.
[03:54:33.780 --> 03:54:39.464]  Quote, there's no doubt that this was a terror attack, Jerusalem Police Commissioner Yoram Halavi said.
[03:54:39.464 --> 03:54:45.769]  He said it was too early to know the identity of the attacker, or if it was a suicide bombing.
[03:54:45.769 --> 03:54:53.435]  RT is reporting 9-11 families hit Obama for siding with Saudi Arabia, want secret report declassified.
[03:54:53.435 --> 03:54:57.077]  Of course, Obama is set to visit Saudi Arabia tomorrow.
[03:54:58.018 --> 03:55:13.269]  To bow and kowtow to the royal dictators, President Barack Obama is facing increased pressure due to a renewed effort to make a secret congressional report public that may describe links between Saudi Arabia and the September 11 terror attacks.
[03:55:13.269 --> 03:55:27.079]  Over the past week, families of 9-11 victims have criticized Obama because of reports stating that his administration is lobbying Congress to block a bill that would allow terror victims to sue foreign governments connected to the attacks on American soil.
[03:55:28.086 --> 03:55:32.768]  Now Hillary Clinton was also asked about that bill.
[03:55:32.768 --> 03:55:34.869]  This is out of the Daily Caller.
[03:55:34.869 --> 03:55:41.913]  Chuck Schumer's legislation, of course, which would allow the families of 9-11 victims to sue the Saudi government.
[03:55:41.913 --> 03:55:50.817]  Clinton surprised ABC's This Week host George Stephanopoulos on Sunday when she said she was not familiar with Schumer's bill.
[03:55:50.817 --> 03:55:52.879]  She claimed she'd never even heard of it.
[03:55:52.879 --> 03:55:57.381]  Hours later, her campaign issued a statement saying that she did back it.
[03:55:58.564 --> 03:56:00.086]  Have you read those papers?
[03:56:00.086 --> 03:56:03.769]  A reporter asked Clinton a second time on Monday.
[03:56:03.769 --> 03:56:05.571]  I'm not commenting.
[03:56:05.571 --> 03:56:07.953]  The Democrat responded.
[03:56:07.953 --> 03:56:17.183]  Isn't that interesting that Hillary Clinton refuses to comment on the 28 pages on Saudi Arabia's involvement with 9-11?
[03:56:18.806 --> 03:56:27.170]  When the Clinton Foundation, before she was even Secretary of State, received $10 million from Saudi Arabia.
[03:56:27.170 --> 03:56:29.671]  Gee, what a coincidence!
[03:56:29.671 --> 03:56:38.375]  And then of course it was under Hillary's State Department that Saudi Arabia got that sweetheart deal with the fighter jets.
[03:56:38.375 --> 03:56:45.859]  So again, that's the reason why she's not commenting on it, because she's in bed with the Saudi dictators.
[03:56:46.807 --> 03:56:52.836]  $10 million donation to the Clinton Foundation before she was even Secretary of State.
[03:56:52.836 --> 03:56:56.961]  Washington Post reports in Wellesley it's curtains for three dancing trumps.
[03:56:57.878 --> 03:57:08.284]  Three 11-year-olds figured they found the perfect plan to reprise their hit performance at last year's Frisk Elementary School talent show, when they donned masks of their retiring principal's face and danced wildly.
[03:57:08.284 --> 03:57:12.187]  This year, they'd be the dancing Donald Trumps.
[03:57:12.187 --> 03:57:17.970]  But God forbid, should they even represent the likeness of Donald Trump.
[03:57:17.970 --> 03:57:25.775]  Somebody complained, somebody was triggered, one person, and the entire show was cancelled.
[03:57:26.929 --> 03:57:36.454]  So again, you can't even wear a face mask and dance around in a silly way by pretending to be Donald Trump without one person complaining.
[03:57:37.512 --> 03:57:45.759]  RT also reports, focus on cat videos, German comic targeted in free speech row with Erdogan suspends TV show.
[03:57:45.759 --> 03:58:01.072]  A German comedian charged with the defamation of the Turkish president has suspended his TV show and let global audiences focus on important topics such as cat videos and celebrity sex lives instead of discussing Ankara's attack on freedom of speech.
[03:58:01.072 --> 03:58:04.716]  So he's basically done some kind of sardonic thing, he's cancelled the show again.
[03:58:05.470 --> 03:58:09.496]  Angela Merkel is pushing for his prosecution.
[03:58:09.496 --> 03:58:19.669]  This is the same Chancellor that works with Zuckerberg, that works with Facebook, that works with ex-East German Stasi officials to censor criticism of migrants.
[03:58:20.370 --> 03:58:24.734]  By the German population, threatening them with fines and prison sentences.
[03:58:24.734 --> 03:58:27.236]  Absolute tyranny happening in Germany.
[03:58:27.236 --> 03:58:29.358]  But that's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour.
