[00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.353]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:09.264 --> 00:00:14.326]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:14.686 --> 00:00:17.007]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:17.027 --> 00:00:22.050]  This is a Monday Global Broadcast Original Transmission.
[00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.970]  We are live.
[00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.791]  Get locked in, loaded, strapped in.
[00:00:25.331 --> 00:00:34.175]  Because this is going to be another roller coaster transmission of mass awakening as we shake the sleeping giant out of its catatonic brain dead
[00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:36.096]  Mind-controlled state.
[00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:51.450]  One of the top survivalists, writers, researchers in the world, also best-selling fiction author, James Wesley Rawls, formerly with Army Intelligence, not just your average Army Intelligence, but let's just say he saw quite a bit of stuff.
[00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.071]  I've run into some...
[00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:53.691]  Really high-level people.
[00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:56.932]  And they go, oh, you have James Rosie Rawls on, like generals and people.
[00:00:56.952 --> 00:00:58.892]  And they go, he did a lot of good work for this country.
[00:00:59.312 --> 00:01:01.693]  So he's a very interesting guy, knows what he's talking about.
[00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:07.894]  He'll be coming on in the second hour into the third hour today.
[00:01:08.694 --> 00:01:15.516]  The last 30 minutes of the three hours that I host, because then David Knight comes in in the fourth hour as we expand transmission here.
[00:01:17.196 --> 00:01:20.497]  We're going to have Rob Doob from Wisconsin, and we're going to have also
[00:01:23.123 --> 00:01:30.888]  Our investigative journalist on the ground from another state, Richard Reeves, joining us with an update on campaign 2016.
[00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:35.131]  That is the most highly covered campaign in the U.S.
[00:01:35.192 --> 00:01:36.613]  worldwide we've ever seen.
[00:01:37.313 --> 00:01:49.742]  Such a huge deal, obviously, with the populist, anti-globalist Trump causing seismic shifts and huge pangs of fear in the robber baron, kleptocratic, oligarchical
[00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:53.272]  Legion of Globalism.
[00:01:53.972 --> 00:01:56.054]  So, David Knight coming up in the fourth hour.
[00:01:56.354 --> 00:02:01.957]  Fourth hour is important and we've added it because then there's a lot of news breaking during the show, a lot of special reports, a lot of special guests.
[00:02:02.657 --> 00:02:08.221]  A lot of days the fourth hour, I think, is just as good and informative, sometimes more so, than the first, second, or third hour.
[00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:17.005]  And we also have seven o'clock every night in the nightly news because so much is happening in this world, we need to add more reporters, more investigative journalists, more people on the ground.
[00:02:17.026 --> 00:02:19.147]  That's why I've, for eight years, been doing the Sunday show.
[00:02:19.927 --> 00:02:20.628]  4 to 6 p.m.
[00:02:20.648 --> 00:02:20.928]  as well.
[00:02:20.948 --> 00:02:21.969]  Did that live yesterday.
[00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.791]  Okay, where to begin?
[00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:28.554]  Obviously, when we come back, I'm going to kick off into all of this.
[00:02:30.656 --> 00:02:34.378]  There are big new developments when it comes to the big steal of election 2016.
[00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.562]  Kasich and others are mainlining that idea.
[00:02:38.582 --> 00:02:41.284]  The establishment
[00:02:43.294 --> 00:02:45.876]  Frontrunner is obviously in second place.
[00:02:45.896 --> 00:02:46.697]  That's Ted Cruz.
[00:02:47.017 --> 00:02:48.598]  But the Bush is fully running him now.
[00:02:48.638 --> 00:02:49.919]  They always did, it turns out.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.460]  That's been confirmed.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.201]  But now they're totally sock-puppeting him.
[00:02:54.222 --> 00:03:01.868]  And they are coming out and stealing the delegates, not just in Tennessee, not just in Louisiana, but now in Nevada.
[00:03:02.528 --> 00:03:04.650]  Doesn't matter that Trump won those states.
[00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.731]  Ted Cruz is to be given those states.
[00:03:07.872 --> 00:03:09.333]  And now that there's not a bigger uproar,
[00:03:10.254 --> 00:03:12.896]  And that they're officially preparing to steal it all at the convention.
[00:03:13.696 --> 00:03:14.957]  They are stealing it before that.
[00:03:15.677 --> 00:03:20.520]  And the mainstream media has combined all of its forces against the American people.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.440]  Forget who Trump is.
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.324]  Against the American people in our popular vote and are stealing it from us in broad daylight at high noon.
[00:03:29.324 --> 00:03:32.366]  So that is coming up as well today.
[00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:35.388]  I just can't believe I'm actually reading this headline here.
[00:03:36.707 --> 00:03:39.929]  Where they just calmly report, Cruz snaring Trump Arizona delegates.
[00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:41.550]  Isn't that just special?
[00:03:43.131 --> 00:03:45.733]  And this will tie into Mr. Rawls joining us.
[00:03:45.913 --> 00:03:51.596]  China jitters could trigger global market bloodbath IMF warrants.
[00:03:54.098 --> 00:03:58.781]  China jitters could trigger global market bloodbath IMF warrants.
[00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:02.549]  Well, that's always been the plan, hasn't it?
[00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:08.170]  And they'll use this new crisis for a whole new round of banker bailouts, consolidation, you name it.
[00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.492]  Gun Owners of America claims victory over Bloomberg Billions.
[00:04:12.632 --> 00:04:14.712]  Very exciting article from Reitbart.
[00:04:14.752 --> 00:04:29.177]  We're going to be getting, later this week, Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America on to discuss the latest battle and the state of the war to defend the Second Amendment against the operatives of foreign banking cartels like
[00:04:30.202 --> 00:04:33.503]  Former Mayor Bloombergus Supremus Tyrannus.
[00:04:35.164 --> 00:04:44.628]  Then, coming up, early in this hour, my first approximation getting up Sunday morning and hearing about the biggest data leak ever in history.
[00:04:44.748 --> 00:04:47.029]  Thousands of times the size of WikiLeaks.
[00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.591]  Devastating information!
[00:04:50.691 --> 00:04:51.631]  What's gonna happen?
[00:04:52.132 --> 00:04:54.133]  The world's rich and famous snared!
[00:04:54.373 --> 00:04:55.733]  The global elite caught!
[00:04:56.293 --> 00:04:57.054]  Oh my gosh!
[00:04:58.772 --> 00:05:00.953]  It's the big data leak of Swiss bank accounts.
[00:05:00.993 --> 00:05:01.474]  No, it's not.
[00:05:03.115 --> 00:05:05.976]  It's the globalist striking at other groups they don't control.
[00:05:09.078 --> 00:05:13.821]  There's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.427]  And if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation, well I'll tell you how.
[00:05:19.948 --> 00:05:25.455]  When the Democrats showed their true colors, you got angry and you elected Republicans.
[00:05:25.976 --> 00:05:31.224]  And then when the Republicans showed their true colors, you got angry and elected Democrats.
[00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:41.732]  And when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your best interest, you acted like they were crazy.
[00:05:42.332 --> 00:05:50.038]  But the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
[00:05:50.538 --> 00:05:56.440]  That's why it is vitally important that you wake up, America, and break the matrix.
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.742]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:02.182 --> 00:06:04.583]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:15.325]  Uh, yeah, Alex, first of all, I want to say, FIFA 12, X2, SuperMill, BrainForce, Prostagart, SilverBullet, I use them all.
[00:06:15.385 --> 00:06:16.326]  They're phenomenal.
[00:06:16.386 --> 00:06:16.887]  They work.
[00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:17.867]  Buy them, folks.
[00:06:17.947 --> 00:06:18.428]  Thank you, brother.
[00:06:18.448 --> 00:06:20.349]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:26.374]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[00:06:26.575 --> 00:06:28.516]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[00:06:28.576 --> 00:06:33.981]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[00:06:34.441 --> 00:06:35.122]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[00:06:35.142 --> 00:06:39.025]  I buy all the Nutraceuticals, Patio FX, uh, Nascent... Right!
[00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:39.805]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:06:39.825 --> 00:06:40.706]  Have they worked for you?
[00:06:40.866 --> 00:06:43.408]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[00:06:43.728 --> 00:06:44.809]  What products are you taking?
[00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:53.015]  Everything from, uh, Super Male to, uh, Brain Force to Winter Sun, uh, X2, even got a little, uh, DNA Force.
[00:06:53.095 --> 00:06:56.618]  So, and I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofilth.
[00:06:56.718 --> 00:07:01.561]  Visit Infowarslives.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[00:07:01.762 --> 00:07:04.924]  That's Infowarslives.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:07:05.044 --> 00:07:09.687]  BrainForce, it's completely different.
[00:07:09.787 --> 00:07:10.828]  Try a bottle of it.
[00:07:11.028 --> 00:07:12.449]  Rob Due joins us.
[00:07:12.609 --> 00:07:15.431]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:16.772]  Tell us what BrainForce did.
[00:07:16.792 --> 00:07:17.733]  I've been working all day.
[00:07:17.773 --> 00:07:20.114]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[00:07:20.254 --> 00:07:21.255]  I get in here at 830.
[00:07:21.675 --> 00:07:23.297]  I was kind of run down.
[00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:25.298]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[00:07:25.498 --> 00:07:27.359]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:29.181]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[00:07:29.221 --> 00:07:29.981]  I popped two of them.
[00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:32.403]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[00:07:32.543 --> 00:07:34.244]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[00:07:34.344 --> 00:07:35.785]  It's got four and a half stars.
[00:07:36.005 --> 00:07:37.026]  People really love it.
[00:07:37.346 --> 00:07:37.867]  Read about it.
[00:07:37.947 --> 00:07:41.689]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:47.053]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:51.116]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[00:07:51.256 --> 00:07:57.081]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[00:07:57.421 --> 00:08:03.326]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:08:18.655 --> 00:08:21.556]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:21.576 --> 00:08:21.596]  4-4, 2016.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.342]  The fourth day already.
[00:08:49.395 --> 00:09:02.547]  Of April 2016, one of the top survivalist experts in the world will be joining us, James Wesley Rawls, for an hour and a half, starting at the kickoff of the second hour.
[00:09:02.947 --> 00:09:11.274]  Then, the last 30 minutes of the third hour, our reporters from two different states, covering election 2016, will join us from on the ground.
[00:09:11.374 --> 00:09:14.797]  Richard Reeves, Rob Dew, Kit Daniels,
[00:09:16.048 --> 00:09:19.571]  And others will be joining us coming up today.
[00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:24.335]  We'll also open the phones up when Mr. Rawls joins us on the broadcast.
[00:09:25.556 --> 00:09:26.557]  Wow, where to start?
[00:09:26.757 --> 00:09:27.218]  Okay.
[00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:36.826]  There is obviously this huge story that broke Saturday night in Europe in one of Germany's biggest newspapers.
[00:09:37.583 --> 00:09:38.443]  I keep meaning to do this.
[00:09:38.463 --> 00:09:46.986]  Will you guys give me the stack of news from last week from the German newspapers with the headline, top German reporters, CIA runs everything.
[00:09:47.686 --> 00:09:54.768]  And then they also, the Chinese news out of England where they admit that it's all state run there.
[00:09:54.788 --> 00:09:55.929]  I mean, that's no secret.
[00:09:56.749 --> 00:10:03.551]  And then I want to take those articles and integrate it in with, oh my gosh, the biggest data leak on the elite ever.
[00:10:05.043 --> 00:10:07.704]  Oh my gosh, this is devastating!
[00:10:08.084 --> 00:10:20.367]  This is going to bring down all of the elite of the world that aren't paying their taxes, and it's going to stop tax havens, and it's really going to show us who the big spider is at the center of the web.
[00:10:21.707 --> 00:10:32.630]  And as soon as I read this 20-something page German newspaper article in English yesterday, from NZ I guess is the name of the big paper, and I looked into some of its background,
[00:10:35.666 --> 00:10:42.261]  It all just clicked and I went on air yesterday before they've done all this and I said, notice they put it out not saying what they found in it yet.
[00:10:42.932 --> 00:10:46.974]  But that for a year, they've had hundreds of other newspapers working with them.
[00:10:47.534 --> 00:10:50.295]  That means hundreds of other operatives inside other newspapers.
[00:10:50.496 --> 00:11:06.243]  When you hear hundreds of other newspapers working together and none of them scooped each other, nobody leaked, boy, when you hear that, you know that means operatives inside the newspapers from German intelligence, British intelligence, US intelligence, NATO intelligence, Interpol intelligence.
[00:11:07.003 --> 00:11:14.249]  Hundreds of- I mean, I'm sitting here reading this 20-page, like 19-page article, and it's red flag, red flag, red flag, red flag, red flag, red flag.
[00:11:14.789 --> 00:11:16.811]  So I came on air yesterday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:11:16.831 --> 00:11:18.192]  I'm not bragging, I just know what I'm talking about.
[00:11:19.198 --> 00:11:30.603]  And I said, you watch, they are going to burn Russian networks where they are basically giving loans to countries to work with them on a smaller scale than what the IMF and World Bank and the globalists do.
[00:11:30.623 --> 00:11:41.307]  And you're going to find all sorts of Russians with Swiss bank accounts and bank accounts in the Caymans and bank accounts in Panama and bank accounts basically everywhere else.
[00:11:42.962 --> 00:11:47.549]  And they're going to have a huge big announcement that Putin's a money launderer and Putin's a criminal.
[00:11:47.869 --> 00:11:49.672]  I mean, it was so obvious where this was going.
[00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:56.111]  And they announced the International Soccer, you know, Football Association, that that's the top of the corruption.
[00:11:56.451 --> 00:12:03.093]  Look at the shock headline, Russian Bank Chief Denies Putin Link to $2 Billion in Offshore Loans.
[00:12:03.313 --> 00:12:04.153]  Oh my gosh!
[00:12:04.873 --> 00:12:15.616]  Our government's given $5 billion, last time they admitted it, last year, to overthrowing Ukraine through the State Department, funding people with machine guns.
[00:12:18.783 --> 00:12:19.844]  That's 5 billion in Ukraine.
[00:12:20.084 --> 00:12:27.452]  How about 5 billion last time they gave us a number, a year and a half ago, given to the quote, moderate rebels.
[00:12:29.094 --> 00:12:34.700]  They spent, what was it, 500 and something million trying to train some and trained four.
[00:12:36.869 --> 00:12:37.249]  We're good to go.
[00:12:56.534 --> 00:12:56.815]  We're good.
[00:13:16.118 --> 00:13:22.141]  Missiles and high-impact weapons, artillery, you name it, are delivered to guys wearing Hawaiian shirts.
[00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:23.041]  I've seen it on the news.
[00:13:23.061 --> 00:13:24.182]  They've shown McCain meeting with them.
[00:13:24.522 --> 00:13:25.843]  Oh, hi, I'm wearing a Hawaiian shirt.
[00:13:25.863 --> 00:13:27.263]  Hey, guys, come on in.
[00:13:27.624 --> 00:13:28.904]  Load the weapons in the warehouse.
[00:13:28.944 --> 00:13:29.484]  See you later.
[00:13:29.544 --> 00:13:30.125]  Thanks.
[00:13:31.886 --> 00:13:33.566]  I'm going to get the Saudi ambassador on the line.
[00:13:33.586 --> 00:13:34.047]  Yes, sir.
[00:13:34.067 --> 00:13:35.187]  The weapons have been delivered.
[00:13:37.388 --> 00:13:40.750]  And that's why they killed the ambassador to get just three warehouses full of weapons.
[00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.911]  That was just part of the invasion goodies.
[00:13:45.228 --> 00:13:51.671]  Because, you go back four years ago, which we first broke four years ago, the Pentagon knew the whole time, and led by the U.S.
[00:13:51.771 --> 00:13:55.833]  Army, they refused to give the weapons to Al-Qaeda.
[00:13:56.994 --> 00:13:59.775]  And Ambassador Stevens refused to give the weapons to Al-Qaeda.
[00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:04.217]  And so, he had to die, didn't he?
[00:14:05.518 --> 00:14:13.602]  And you've heard that from Tosh Plumley, you've heard that from Colonel Schaefer, you've heard that from the Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel we had on last week.
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:16.801]  I mean, this is what's going on.
[00:14:17.721 --> 00:14:24.384]  And the weapons get shipped down into Mexico now to fence them.
[00:14:24.444 --> 00:14:26.045]  That's a new thing in the last two years.
[00:14:26.065 --> 00:14:29.587]  I mean, they've been doing Fast and Furious before Obama even got in office.
[00:14:29.607 --> 00:14:30.127]  That's come out.
[00:14:30.567 --> 00:14:31.928]  That's why the parties are leaving it alone.
[00:14:31.948 --> 00:14:33.889]  But it got bigger under Obama to blame the Second Amendment.
[00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:37.331]  That was just a blowback deal, though, where they used that as a way to frame the Second Amendment.
[00:14:37.551 --> 00:14:40.492]  But for the last few years, they've been shipping most of the arms now through Mexico.
[00:14:42.393 --> 00:14:42.693]  U.S.
[00:14:42.814 --> 00:14:43.614]  Army issued
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.001]  What do they call it, 5-5-6?
[00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:48.824]  The military, I call it 2-2-3.
[00:14:48.844 --> 00:14:54.433]  The point is, NATO rounds, 3-0-8, full auto, hand grenades, rocket launchers, .50 caliber Barrett's.
[00:14:56.018 --> 00:14:59.941]  And Colonel Matt Smith-Mack talked about all of that with us last week.
[00:15:00.782 --> 00:15:02.063]  This is all out in the open.
[00:15:02.083 --> 00:15:02.663]  It's so huge.
[00:15:03.264 --> 00:15:08.788]  Oh, and of course it's in the news that the French leadership and the socialists have all been caught basically not paying taxes.
[00:15:08.989 --> 00:15:18.817]  The EU bureaucrats exempt themselves from EU taxes and have Swiss bank accounts, Luxembourg bank accounts, Monte Carlo bank accounts in the trillions of dollars.
[00:15:19.867 --> 00:15:20.768]  Trillions!
[00:15:21.148 --> 00:15:25.551]  The world currency market every day is in the multi-trillions.
[00:15:25.871 --> 00:15:40.221]  There is 2.2, last time the government admitted it four years ago, it's grown since then, quadrillion, 2.2 quadrillion in fake counterfeit credit default swaps and other counterfeit instruments.
[00:15:41.562 --> 00:15:42.423]  This is so huge.
[00:15:45.605 --> 00:15:48.087]  Worldwide, and oh my gosh, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:15:49.258 --> 00:15:59.546]  Did you hear Vladimir Putin and the Russians are connected to $2 billion in loans to countries around the world to get better deals for Russian affiliated businesses?
[00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:02.448]  That's what the IMF and the World Bank does with U.S.
[00:16:02.488 --> 00:16:03.108]  taxpayer money.
[00:16:03.268 --> 00:16:05.790]  We give more than half the money to the IMF and World Bank.
[00:16:06.251 --> 00:16:10.294]  They go in to African, Latin American, Asian countries, you name it, and say,
[00:16:11.598 --> 00:16:19.888]  We're going to give you a loan, but your government has to agree it all goes back to our subsidiary company, and then most of the time they don't even build anything in the third world country.
[00:16:20.089 --> 00:16:22.552]  They just send the taxpayer money back to themselves.
[00:16:24.349 --> 00:16:35.713]  So I'm not defending the Russians, but when you see German major investigative journals telling you that they're exposing the biggest thing in the world, that's because people are so ignorant.
[00:16:35.973 --> 00:16:38.014]  Remember Merkel was criticizing the NSA?
[00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:42.915]  Turned out Merkel has like double the spying on the Germans of anybody else.
[00:16:42.995 --> 00:16:44.476]  I mean, no one is spot on like Germans.
[00:16:44.836 --> 00:16:45.496]  It's the worst.
[00:16:46.196 --> 00:16:48.637]  It's just over and beyond anything you've ever seen.
[00:16:49.337 --> 00:16:50.958]  That's just been going on since World War II.
[00:16:51.018 --> 00:16:51.518]  It never stopped.
[00:16:54.008 --> 00:16:54.728]  That's no secret.
[00:16:54.988 --> 00:16:57.429]  I mean, all of Germany just became Stasi-run, basically.
[00:16:57.449 --> 00:16:59.070]  Facebook works with the Stasi now.
[00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.930]  They've resurrected it.
[00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.811]  That's in the Associated Press with a straight face.
[00:17:02.191 --> 00:17:04.071]  I mean, this is what's going on.
[00:17:04.331 --> 00:17:05.172]  This is what's happening.
[00:17:05.372 --> 00:17:12.334]  The German press is the most lying, most corrupt, most deceptive, most out of control, and I'll tell you why.
[00:17:13.752 --> 00:17:17.135]  The Russians in the United States killed 21 million Germans.
[00:17:17.175 --> 00:17:18.396]  That was more than a third of them.
[00:17:18.857 --> 00:17:20.078]  Took over and killed.
[00:17:20.118 --> 00:17:21.719]  Anybody didn't play ball after World War II.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.161]  Germany is run by the globalists 100%.
[00:17:24.822 --> 00:17:27.905]  That's why their policies of open borders are the same as Obama's.
[00:17:28.445 --> 00:17:29.586]  They're carbon copies.
[00:17:29.907 --> 00:17:31.688]  The politically correct language, everything.
[00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:33.430]  Germany is occupied.
[00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.011]  Germany is controlled.
[00:17:35.332 --> 00:17:36.372]  Germany is captured.
[00:17:36.553 --> 00:17:40.036]  There's only one country in Europe that isn't globalist run.
[00:17:41.397 --> 00:17:43.159]  One country, and that's France.
[00:17:43.459 --> 00:17:47.202]  And they are pathetic, they are corrupt, they are ridiculous, they are nuts.
[00:17:47.563 --> 00:17:56.251]  But General de Gaulle, when he was president, had French troops go in, and there were even firefights around France that people never heard about, with NATO.
[00:17:56.531 --> 00:17:57.031]  You can look it up.
[00:17:57.291 --> 00:18:01.776]  And took the French nuclear weapons that were, quote, assigned to them, took the NATO nukes.
[00:18:02.616 --> 00:18:03.877]  And France became sovereign again.
[00:18:04.098 --> 00:18:07.581]  Then they sent in British Special Forces, the Jackal, and others to try to kill him.
[00:18:09.867 --> 00:18:11.048]  And they make movies about it.
[00:18:12.569 --> 00:18:16.292]  It doesn't point out that it's, I mean, they point out it's British commando, but not that it's British government.
[00:18:16.933 --> 00:18:21.476]  I mean, so the French are the only country in Europe that isn't completely run by the globalists.
[00:18:22.777 --> 00:18:24.298]  And they're just as bad and horrible.
[00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:27.681]  The whole thing comes from France with the Jacobins and the French Revolution.
[00:18:27.901 --> 00:18:28.662]  I'm not defending them.
[00:18:30.111 --> 00:18:37.696]  But you've got some infighting by these power structures, so I'm going to get more into that later, but it is just ridiculous that as soon as I got up this morning, I knew what I'd read.
[00:18:38.476 --> 00:18:40.077]  Oh, the International Football League.
[00:18:40.437 --> 00:18:43.840]  Oh, the international organizations of this and that.
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:48.963]  Anything Russia has any play in, and anything that has any media power,
[00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:54.848]  The Anglo-American establishment is taking it over with scandals and investigations to bring it in.
[00:18:55.188 --> 00:18:57.909]  The FBI is indicting basically everybody internationally.
[00:18:58.169 --> 00:19:02.771]  Just the FBI comes to your hotel in Germany, doesn't matter, throws a bag over your head.
[00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:10.275]  Remember how when they thought Stud was coming into Germany or other places, they had fighter jets in the air and everything, NATO did?
[00:19:11.095 --> 00:19:12.996]  I mean, that's all occupied, folks.
[00:19:13.516 --> 00:19:14.296]  That's occupied.
[00:19:17.518 --> 00:19:17.638]  And
[00:19:19.096 --> 00:19:21.758]  It's just incredible that that's what's really going on.
[00:19:21.778 --> 00:19:23.519]  This is a major war with Russia.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:48.318]  There's economic war, military war, proxy war, internal infiltration, sabotage, currency wars going on, and now they're going to go after the entire Russian network internationally, at the same time roll up millions of people that went and set up legal tax offshore accounts that the globalists allowed under law, but they don't want the general public to have it.
[00:19:49.827 --> 00:19:57.597]  And then when you have jury trials, when people fight to get them, they'll say, they were in a Russian network, they were in a Russian offshore, which isn't even true.
[00:19:58.238 --> 00:20:01.222]  You see, it's just multinational groups that the Russians were working in.
[00:20:01.642 --> 00:20:02.583]  So that's all this is.
[00:20:02.603 --> 00:20:06.508]  That's why the quote, data dumps the biggest ever, because it's right down to people with $20,000.
[00:20:10.778 --> 00:20:12.839]  December 7th, 1941.
[00:20:13.139 --> 00:20:16.980]  A date which will live in infamy.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.561]  Remember Pearl Harbor.

[00:22:43.817 --> 00:22:45.819]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:22:46.059 --> 00:22:48.781]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:22:49.021 --> 00:22:49.522]  His excuse?
[00:22:49.542 --> 00:22:50.963]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:22:51.223 --> 00:22:52.504]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.

[00:24:36.222 --> 00:24:42.785]  The movie I use as a cultural lexicon because it's got so many lessons in it.
[00:24:43.786 --> 00:24:48.975]  And he's sitting there in the fine French restaurant in a tuxedo with all these old, rich people.
[00:24:50.658 --> 00:24:55.626]  And he's being a little bit loud, and so the maitre d' comes over and goes, sir, and he goes, so that's what it is.

[00:25:16.992 --> 00:25:18.913]  Well, say goodnight to the bad guy.
[00:25:18.933 --> 00:25:25.314]  Because it's the last time you're going to see me like this.
[00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:28.532]  What he means is, I'm not coming back to your French restaurant.
[00:25:29.613 --> 00:25:30.935]  I don't need your acceptance.
[00:25:31.455 --> 00:25:32.877]  I don't want your upper class.
[00:25:33.237 --> 00:25:34.238]  You stink.
[00:25:34.539 --> 00:25:35.420]  You're a joke.
[00:25:36.681 --> 00:25:42.607]  That's a very empowering moment when you don't need the boat bigger than the next guy or the car better than the next guy.
[00:25:42.888 --> 00:25:46.472]  When somebody pulls up in their car and it's faster than yours, you're like, great, dude, I don't care.
[00:25:49.282 --> 00:25:53.203]  It's that moment when you sit there and you instantly look at a news article.
[00:25:54.083 --> 00:25:55.744]  You go, oh my gosh, it's the Germans.
[00:25:56.364 --> 00:25:59.045]  Oh yeah, it's an intelligence agency affiliated group.
[00:25:59.425 --> 00:26:02.426]  Oh, they worked for over a year with hundreds of other newspapers?
[00:26:03.046 --> 00:26:04.766]  With key people to vet it all?
[00:26:05.046 --> 00:26:11.688]  That was to go through it and get permission that it didn't burn any other clandestine Western affiliated group to cherry pick.
[00:26:13.945 --> 00:26:20.148]  An entire giant complex of law firms robbed through NSA technology back doors.
[00:26:20.428 --> 00:26:32.375]  There's the big crime to selectively blackmail over the last year and roll up foreign intelligence networks and to get them to turn and flip to work for you so you won't get prosecuted.
[00:26:33.524 --> 00:26:40.827]  And then, you have the nerve to put it out there like you've exposed the biggest money laundering network in history, $2 billion.
[00:26:40.967 --> 00:26:42.588]  Oh my gosh!
[00:26:42.728 --> 00:26:44.209]  And it's Russian loans.
[00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:47.711]  Boy, I tell you, you know what?
[00:26:47.991 --> 00:26:49.331]  Russia should be blown off the map.
[00:26:49.571 --> 00:26:52.693]  Everyone should be executed in Russia for $2 billion in loans.
[00:26:53.013 --> 00:26:53.333]  I agree.
[00:26:53.513 --> 00:26:55.094]  They're the worst criminals on earth.
[00:26:55.414 --> 00:26:56.995]  Anyone worse needs to be getting in more trouble.
[00:26:57.295 --> 00:27:01.617]  Oh wait, our government's run by criminals that have created thousands of quadrillion.
[00:27:02.827 --> 00:27:07.050]  Thousands of trillions have, I mean I could play the CNN pieces even.
[00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:13.555]  I used to cover this 15, 16 years ago and I couldn't believe the court filings I was covering on air that weren't on the news.
[00:27:13.615 --> 00:27:17.158]  I was having lawyers in to talk about it in like 1998, 1999.
[00:27:18.279 --> 00:27:31.969]  I would have lawyers on and pro se people that had the rulings where they would have a deed to their 50 acre ranchette that they'd had for decades, that they'd paid cash for, and then Bank of America, it was usually Bank of America,
[00:27:33.424 --> 00:27:37.786]  Some cases, Wells Fargo, you name it, would come along and just say, we're foreclosing, we own it.
[00:27:37.806 --> 00:27:39.807]  And they'd go, you don't have a deed, I own this.
[00:27:39.887 --> 00:27:41.008]  And they'd go, no, we have the deed.
[00:27:41.748 --> 00:27:45.290]  And a lot of times it wasn't even their fault at Wells Fargo or Bank of America.
[00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:50.613]  They'd been sold it by some other bank who bought it from some other bank and no one even knew where it came from.
[00:27:50.733 --> 00:27:53.894]  I've got CNN pieces that I've aired.
[00:27:54.474 --> 00:27:55.935]  I mean, if you're doubting this, it's incredible.
[00:27:56.656 --> 00:27:57.636]  And believe me, I doubt it too.
[00:27:58.096 --> 00:27:59.157]  But everybody's heard about this now.
[00:28:00.526 --> 00:28:05.089]  Where a family in Florida had a million dollar home they built themselves 20 years before.
[00:28:06.369 --> 00:28:08.811]  This is like in 2009 all this came out, remember?
[00:28:08.931 --> 00:28:09.571]  The subprime deal.
[00:28:10.472 --> 00:28:11.652]  They built the house on cash.
[00:28:11.812 --> 00:28:13.253]  They themselves were developers.
[00:28:13.613 --> 00:28:14.334]  It was their house.
[00:28:15.595 --> 00:28:20.037]  And Bank of America had bought the loan and since sold it, I think it was like 18 times again.
[00:28:22.318 --> 00:28:26.502]  And then they came and took their house, and then other banks came to take the house.
[00:28:26.663 --> 00:28:27.704]  There was never a loan.
[00:28:27.904 --> 00:28:28.865]  There was never a note.
[00:28:29.546 --> 00:28:31.288]  They paid for the house outright.
[00:28:32.028 --> 00:28:36.033]  Their name was just thrown in with their deed and stolen!
[00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:37.589]  And
[00:28:58.351 --> 00:29:15.199]  Six months later, Bank of America won't pay him back, won't give him the house, so the judge orders the People's Court, that's what it is, the constables, to go with the Sheriff's Department and take the money out of the vault or order them to write a cashier's check, and at that point, they folded and did it.
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:20.202]  That is the mega, arrogant, total, absolute corruption.
[00:29:20.222 --> 00:29:20.842]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:29:20.862 --> 00:29:23.603]  Sweet Justice, a Florida couple foreclosure on Bank of America.
[00:29:23.623 --> 00:29:23.883]  There it is.
[00:29:23.903 --> 00:29:24.524]  The guys found it.
[00:29:25.724 --> 00:29:25.924]  June 6, 2011.
[00:29:28.413 --> 00:29:29.816]  This stuff started coming out in 2009.
[00:29:29.976 --> 00:29:31.519]  I was covering it in the 90s.
[00:29:31.559 --> 00:29:31.659]  And...
[00:29:34.537 --> 00:29:35.858]  Oh, but the Russians, $2 billion.
[00:29:35.878 --> 00:29:37.099]  This is what I mean, folks.
[00:29:37.139 --> 00:29:37.759]  The whole system.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:45.085]  The interest rates, the currency rates, the stock market they admitted last week is 98% fraud, run by the Federal Reserve the last decade.
[00:29:45.345 --> 00:29:45.965]  It's all fraud.
[00:29:46.085 --> 00:29:47.666]  All insider trading.
[00:29:47.686 --> 00:29:48.507]  99, 98% of it.
[00:29:48.567 --> 00:29:55.852]  I mean, this is literally Satan telling you that Casper the Friendly Ghost is the most powerful demon in the galaxy.
[00:29:56.412 --> 00:29:56.693]  Okay?
[00:29:57.313 --> 00:29:58.274]  We're on the march.
[00:29:58.714 --> 00:30:00.315]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:01.236 --> 00:30:03.938]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:08.669 --> 00:30:09.609]  Who do you prefer?
[00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:13.111]  Barack Obama or George W. Bush?
[00:30:13.491 --> 00:30:18.413]  Well, if you haven't figured it out by now, these guys are corporate spokesmen.
[00:30:18.453 --> 00:30:19.253]  They're not leaders.
[00:30:19.513 --> 00:30:21.834]  I mean, they both started illegal wars.
[00:30:22.154 --> 00:30:23.755]  Hell, they both tortured people.
[00:30:23.995 --> 00:30:27.596]  They bailed out criminal corporations and they spied on you.
[00:30:27.776 --> 00:30:32.138]  They both violated the Constitution and they even committed war crimes.
[00:30:32.478 --> 00:30:33.359]  So what's it gonna take?
[00:30:33.659 --> 00:30:36.120]  I mean, what will it take to finally wake you up?
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:36.941]  Think about it.
[00:30:37.221 --> 00:30:46.146]  If Joseph Stalin ran for president as a Democrat, and Adolf Hitler ran as a Republican, one of them would end up leading our country.
[00:30:46.366 --> 00:30:50.029]  It's elephants and asses screwing the masses.
[00:30:50.309 --> 00:30:53.671]  And your choice between the two parties is a myth.
[00:30:53.891 --> 00:30:58.654]  Because in reality, it is a two-party tyranny with one ideology.
[00:30:58.754 --> 00:31:00.255]  Divide and conquer.
[00:31:00.515 --> 00:31:05.198]  So join the revolution and break the false left versus right paradigm.
[00:31:05.478 --> 00:31:06.779]  Infowars.com.
[00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:38.618]  In the history of InfoWars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.

[00:31:48.542 --> 00:31:52.704]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.

[00:32:02.669 --> 00:32:05.430]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:10.953]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:32:11.274 --> 00:32:19.279]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:32:19.499 --> 00:32:24.543]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:33:17.955 --> 00:33:28.538]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.558 --> 00:33:32.840]  Yes, they're now creating human embryos from three or four parents.
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:33.980]  Strange days have found us.
[00:33:35.341 --> 00:33:39.482]  Climate Depot's reporting snow across many areas of the United States.
[00:33:40.162 --> 00:33:43.483]  And snow across the Caribbean islands.
[00:33:44.403 --> 00:33:45.764]  Colorado ski resorts.
[00:33:46.983 --> 00:33:48.604]  Snowiest in 50 years.
[00:33:48.704 --> 00:33:50.124]  Snow chaos in Germany.
[00:33:52.105 --> 00:33:57.547]  But if you actually go back to the history books, over 150 years there was a period of time when it was snowing in the Caribbean.
[00:33:58.488 --> 00:34:09.132]  There are reports 400 years ago in British fleet journals, in historical books, I've read about snow in the summer in the Caribbean.
[00:34:10.713 --> 00:34:11.393]  In the early summer.
[00:34:13.626 --> 00:34:16.952]  That's because the only thing that's constant is change in the climate.
[00:34:17.473 --> 00:34:20.879]  That's why they talk about climate stability and stopping climate change.
[00:34:20.939 --> 00:34:23.203]  Just a few years ago, it was global warming.
[00:34:24.428 --> 00:34:32.253]  But then the warming, it turned out, stopped 18 years ago, and we started cooling the last six or seven because of sunspot activity.
[00:34:32.293 --> 00:34:34.014]  The sun is not generating as much heat.
[00:34:34.714 --> 00:34:41.559]  You know, the UN voted five years ago at the UN Summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, when they were trying to push a world government treaty for carbon taxes.
[00:34:41.599 --> 00:34:47.863]  They said, well, we voted because a group of scientists worldwide are saying it's the sun that controls most our weather.
[00:34:48.303 --> 00:34:49.384]  They voted, though.
[00:34:49.404 --> 00:34:52.626]  The UN voted and said that the sun does not affect climate.
[00:34:53.407 --> 00:35:00.028]  Just like the Pope, I guess, said 600 years ago that the Earth was the center of the universe and that the Sun orbited it.
[00:35:00.048 --> 00:35:01.828]  Of course, that's not true.
[00:35:02.989 --> 00:35:09.950]  But the UN, you know, they tell us the polar bear population is endangered.
[00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:13.970]  Well, you can use that word all day.
[00:35:14.551 --> 00:35:16.911]  It's not an endangered species, folks.
[00:35:16.971 --> 00:35:22.652]  Its numbers are up five-fold in Northern Europe and about four-fold in the Northern
[00:35:24.147 --> 00:35:25.309]  United States and Canada.
[00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.514]  You talk about Alaska and over into Canada and you can just pull those numbers up.
[00:35:28.914 --> 00:35:35.144]  Polar bears are five-fold up on average globally and expanding their ranges.
[00:35:36.448 --> 00:35:38.369]  So there are more human interactions.
[00:35:38.749 --> 00:35:41.130]  There's more interactions with polar bears and grizzlies as well.
[00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:45.731]  They're finding a lot of grizzly kills because the polar bears are about twice as more powerful.
[00:35:46.031 --> 00:35:47.212]  Just rip their heads off.
[00:35:48.272 --> 00:35:54.454]  And so we can all enjoy that now, the little sweet polar bears and the Coca-Cola commercials that are all dead and when the penguins can't swim.
[00:35:55.594 --> 00:35:57.675]  This is how dumb they think they are.
[00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:01.111]  Of course, I kept saying polar bears can swim 300 miles.
[00:36:01.211 --> 00:36:01.732]  I was wrong.
[00:36:01.792 --> 00:36:05.214]  Longest polar bear swim recorded, 426 miles straight.
[00:36:05.474 --> 00:36:13.979]  They hunt beluga and walrus in the spring and summer and then swim back to the rocky escarpments for the winter.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.742]  And then have their babies in the den and emerge in the spring.
[00:36:17.762 --> 00:36:18.922]  That's how they operate.
[00:36:20.603 --> 00:36:26.247]  But you've seen the newscast saying they are out there drowned in the ocean.
[00:36:27.253 --> 00:36:37.463]  Because they can't, they can't swim and there's no ice and... How many shows, this polar bear desperately looks for a place to sleep at night, but can't find it, and they'll show him like paddling.
[00:36:38.744 --> 00:36:40.486]  These penguins are under the same assault!
[00:36:40.746 --> 00:36:42.928]  I mean, that's how dumb they think you are!
[00:36:42.968 --> 00:36:45.130]  Now, those are in children's shows!
[00:36:46.272 --> 00:36:51.537]  Children's for Discovery, Children Nickelodeon, it's not on the regular nature shows for adults!
[00:36:55.267 --> 00:36:58.788]  The most powerful land animal may also be the most powerful sea animal.
[00:36:59.128 --> 00:37:01.709]  Swimming more than 300 miles to hunt whale.
[00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:06.671]  With one arm, it holds in an over 1,000 pound beluga bull.
[00:37:07.231 --> 00:37:07.672]  Boom!
[00:37:07.732 --> 00:37:10.253]  Drags it in onto the ice.
[00:37:11.733 --> 00:37:12.093]  One arm.
[00:37:12.233 --> 00:37:12.613]  Boom!
[00:37:12.633 --> 00:37:13.974]  Just drags it right up like it's nothing.
[00:37:14.554 --> 00:37:17.755]  Swimming 400 miles, we now know.
[00:37:17.775 --> 00:37:18.316]  400 miles!
[00:37:18.716 --> 00:37:23.998]  And they show the famous photo of one perched on a floating piece of ice.
[00:37:25.666 --> 00:37:31.391]  That has been in Audubon Societies and in thousands of publications and the cover of calendars.
[00:37:31.732 --> 00:37:32.532]  Save the Earth!
[00:37:32.893 --> 00:37:34.114]  Stop global warming!
[00:37:34.414 --> 00:37:34.674]  Look!
[00:37:34.854 --> 00:37:36.135]  The juvenile polar bear!
[00:37:36.416 --> 00:37:37.337]  It can't live!
[00:37:37.537 --> 00:37:38.618]  Just look at those forearms!
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.620]  Look at those back legs!
[00:37:42.882 --> 00:37:44.083]  Look at that amazing creature!
[00:37:44.883 --> 00:37:46.405]  It's up there hunting whales!
[00:37:47.406 --> 00:37:48.607]  Hunting seals!
[00:37:49.207 --> 00:37:50.849]  Hunting walrus!
[00:37:52.449 --> 00:38:03.059]  But according to the magic intellectual liberals that want to control what language we can use because they're so liberal, that is the last hours as the ice melts.
[00:38:04.758 --> 00:38:11.702]  And they can point cameras every year in the spring and summer at the collapsing glaciers saying, look, the ice is melting.
[00:38:11.862 --> 00:38:12.702]  It always melts.
[00:38:13.122 --> 00:38:14.103]  It snows in the winter.
[00:38:14.243 --> 00:38:15.023]  It piles up.
[00:38:15.704 --> 00:38:17.044]  It flows out as ice.
[00:38:17.385 --> 00:38:18.965]  And in the spring and summer, it melts.
[00:38:19.466 --> 00:38:24.969]  It contracts in the warm months, expands in the cold months, in the Arctic and Antarctic.
[00:38:25.029 --> 00:38:27.790]  I mean, I'm stating things that are known facts here.
[00:38:30.291 --> 00:38:33.213]  But you see, I don't have access to kids in public school or the colleges.
[00:38:36.072 --> 00:38:36.933]  I don't have access to them.
[00:38:37.633 --> 00:38:42.837]  You've got access to them as their parents, or, you know, maybe as the football coach or whatever.
[00:38:42.897 --> 00:38:45.779]  I mean, just somehow warn them about how they're being lied to.
[00:38:45.859 --> 00:38:48.802]  Okay, I literally have hundreds and hundreds of bombshell articles.
[00:38:48.822 --> 00:38:49.562]  I'm not getting to them.
[00:38:49.602 --> 00:38:50.263]  I apologize.
[00:38:51.664 --> 00:38:55.587]  When James Wesley Rawls joins us in the next hour, I'm going to get into the state of the world economy.
[00:38:55.607 --> 00:38:59.330]  I'm going to get into the state of the attack on guns from his intel, his sources.
[00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:04.734]  He's got a lot of amazing sources inside.
[00:39:07.096 --> 00:39:08.256]  Connections, we'll leave it at that.
[00:39:09.516 --> 00:39:10.437]  On what's going on.
[00:39:10.697 --> 00:39:11.957]  Clearly trying to start a race war.
[00:39:12.317 --> 00:39:13.717]  Clearly trying to start a class war.
[00:39:14.057 --> 00:39:15.898]  Clearly they're accelerating to steal the election.
[00:39:16.198 --> 00:39:22.899]  What is James Wesley Rawls, one of the top survivalist experts out there, one of the most respected, joining us for an hour and a half today.
[00:39:22.919 --> 00:39:26.320]  We'll also open the phones up in the second half of the interview with him.
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:33.621]  But before I go any further, let's just get into the latest Donald Trump news.
[00:39:34.784 --> 00:39:37.125]  And Election 2016 news, it is huge.
[00:39:37.886 --> 00:39:48.172]  The steel is even getting more nasty, more flagrant, more unabashed, more hubris, chutzpah, bravado.
[00:39:52.335 --> 00:39:52.875]  A plum?
[00:39:52.915 --> 00:39:54.116]  I mean, I don't know what word.
[00:39:54.996 --> 00:39:55.737]  Confidence game.
[00:39:56.137 --> 00:39:57.678]  Just total con game.
[00:39:58.298 --> 00:40:00.760]  It's like a guy in a fur coat with jewels all over him.
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.081]  Peacock him.
[00:40:03.317 --> 00:40:14.146]  And studies show it may look ridiculous, it may be out of control, but if you're really confident and walk into a bar with some of the most beautiful women out there, you're going to leave with as many of them as you can put on your arm because peacocking works.
[00:40:14.866 --> 00:40:16.167]  And that's what these guys do.
[00:40:17.568 --> 00:40:21.672]  They just act confident as they rob everybody.
[00:40:21.692 --> 00:40:22.712]  But I've noticed in this culture,
[00:40:23.669 --> 00:40:24.890]  Peacocking isn't enough.
[00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:29.452]  So many men peacock in business and life when they don't really have the goods.
[00:40:29.872 --> 00:40:31.373]  They don't have the horsepower under the hood.
[00:40:31.773 --> 00:40:32.694]  They don't have the brains.
[00:40:33.454 --> 00:40:34.495]  They don't have the ingenuity.
[00:40:34.515 --> 00:40:36.316]  They don't have the background, the connections.
[00:40:36.596 --> 00:40:40.478]  All they got is acting smart, keeping their mouth shut, and acting confident.
[00:40:40.498 --> 00:40:49.343]  I remember being about 15, 16 and noticing like the bullies and the thugs acted like they were tough, they acted like they were smart, but there was nothing under the hood.
[00:40:49.363 --> 00:40:51.444]  It was all talk.
[00:40:52.185 --> 00:40:52.625]  No action.
[00:40:55.714 --> 00:40:57.215]  And that's what our society is.
[00:40:57.275 --> 00:40:58.616]  That's why I'm so against this elite.
[00:40:59.236 --> 00:41:01.298]  Because they're not just con men that have taken over.
[00:41:01.958 --> 00:41:07.722]  They're in competition with other wealth and other ideas and art and literature and culture.
[00:41:08.002 --> 00:41:13.445]  So they want to stun it and make it ugly and dumb and mentally ill so they can rule us?
[00:41:13.645 --> 00:41:13.925]  Really?
[00:41:14.046 --> 00:41:14.986]  That's our rulers?
[00:41:15.106 --> 00:41:15.446]  Really?
[00:41:16.147 --> 00:41:16.427]  Really?
[00:41:16.447 --> 00:41:23.992]  I mean, I wouldn't want rulers to begin with, but these are the nastiest and ugliest and wickedest and
[00:41:25.202 --> 00:41:30.304]  Most spiritually twisted hunchback I've ever seen.
[00:41:30.324 --> 00:41:35.366]  And I think that goes to say why they hate us so much.
[00:41:36.246 --> 00:41:42.989]  Because you may not think anything of yourself, but because you are a moral, loving soul, these devils don't like you.
[00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:47.950]  Because they see what a bright, beautiful creature you are.
[00:41:48.451 --> 00:41:49.051]  They don't like it.
[00:41:49.711 --> 00:41:51.212]  Okay, let's get into the Trump situation.
[00:41:51.572 --> 00:41:53.993]  First off, Anthroplex
[00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:58.052]  Has many of the same herbs that are in Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[00:41:58.072 --> 00:41:59.493]  The two things don't compete with each other.
[00:41:59.593 --> 00:42:00.614]  They augment each other.
[00:42:02.295 --> 00:42:07.359]  And quite frankly, I went to Dr. Group and I went to other big top labs and I said, I want something better than Super Male Vitality.
[00:42:09.341 --> 00:42:10.042]  And they said, why?
[00:42:10.082 --> 00:42:11.043]  This is a really good formula.
[00:42:11.083 --> 00:42:11.703]  It's cold press.
[00:42:11.743 --> 00:42:12.183]  It's excellent.
[00:42:12.203 --> 00:42:12.904]  You have great reviews.
[00:42:13.284 --> 00:42:15.987]  And I said, well, people just like more products.
[00:42:16.147 --> 00:42:18.369]  And I said, quite frankly, I want something that costs less money.
[00:42:20.239 --> 00:42:26.918]  That has a lot of the same herbs that are high quality, non-GMO, fresh, but are dry because that costs less.
[00:42:30.126 --> 00:42:31.946]  And then Dr. Gribbs said, well, you know what I can do?
[00:42:31.986 --> 00:42:37.287]  There's a few things that don't work in the formula with Supra Male or Supra Female that don't work to be cold-pressed that I would have added.
[00:42:37.648 --> 00:42:44.369]  I'll have this added to this and then it's a great base for somebody to add Supra Male or Supra Female Vitality on top of.
[00:42:44.709 --> 00:42:47.310]  Or you could take it by itself, and quite frankly, I get incredible results.
[00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:53.911]  It varies for everybody, and we don't sell it as an aphrodisiac, but that really is the most noticeable thing, I'll just tell you right now.
[00:42:54.671 --> 00:42:58.455]  And so it's got a five-star, five, pure five-star rating.
[00:42:58.655 --> 00:43:00.016]  That's the highest we've got.
[00:43:00.076 --> 00:43:01.437]  Usually it's 4.9, 4.7.
[00:43:01.998 --> 00:43:03.559]  Third-party review site, Power Reviews.
[00:43:05.241 --> 00:43:08.524]  Five-star review, and it's unbelievable.
[00:43:09.184 --> 00:43:09.825]  And quite frankly,
[00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:13.331]  Well, just try it out for yourself.
[00:43:13.732 --> 00:43:14.933]  It works in women, too.
[00:43:15.013 --> 00:43:17.495]  I don't know why we ended up just coming out targeting men.
[00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:20.718]  But it works in men and women.
[00:43:21.138 --> 00:43:21.999]  And it is selling out.
[00:43:22.019 --> 00:43:23.180]  We won't have more for a couple weeks.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.301]  Just want to give you a heads up on that.
[00:43:24.561 --> 00:43:25.602]  Sign up for AutoShip.
[00:43:28.104 --> 00:43:32.068]  And by that, say when you want to be delivered again, you can cancel any time, get 10% off.
[00:43:32.388 --> 00:43:35.571]  And on orders above $50, $50 or more, you get free shipping.
[00:43:37.455 --> 00:43:46.525]  That's free shipping on orders of $50 or more and you get 10% off when you sign up for auto ship on any of the products.
[00:43:46.565 --> 00:43:48.688]  That could be Hillary for prison t-shirts, you name it.
[00:43:50.046 --> 00:43:51.487]  Mulan law-based shirts, you name it.
[00:43:52.128 --> 00:43:54.730]  So excited to see so many great listeners out there.
[00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:55.711]  We have those live feeds.
[00:43:56.111 --> 00:44:03.357]  It's really made our TV viewers and radio listeners excited when they tune in to Infowars.com forward slash show or different TV stations around the country like Houston and others.
[00:44:03.897 --> 00:44:12.765]  And they're able to actually go down a line of Trump folks or people going into a Trump rally and maybe one in 10 that's conservative is wearing an Infowars.com shirt.
[00:44:12.785 --> 00:44:15.807]  And the exciting part is some of the shirts are homemade.
[00:44:15.847 --> 00:44:16.728]  They're not shirts I made.
[00:44:18.442 --> 00:44:21.085]  So there's a whole industry out there of folks putting on InfoWars shirts.
[00:44:21.806 --> 00:44:26.392]  And as people have learned that I haven't come after them for that, it's really proliferated.
[00:44:26.452 --> 00:44:27.554]  All I want to do is get the word out.
[00:44:28.955 --> 00:44:32.240]  And so there are a lot of cool designs out there on the web, I'll tell you, that aren't ours.
[00:44:34.179 --> 00:44:34.640]  I don't think so.
[00:44:52.374 --> 00:44:56.077]  It's almost a white lie because it's almost the same shirt, but it's enough different.
[00:44:56.357 --> 00:44:57.738]  Look, it's backed by popular demand.
[00:44:57.758 --> 00:45:00.720]  I've had six or seven other limited editions, never brought them back.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.101]  People really got upset by us taking it off.
[00:45:03.522 --> 00:45:08.265]  And so it's back with red lettering on the back, Infowars.com, legalized freedom.
[00:45:09.245 --> 00:45:16.250]  And on the front, it's the same except it says Hillary for prison 2016, and then a small stamp under it till the end of time.
[00:45:17.944 --> 00:45:20.046]  We should probably come in the next segment with Magic Moment.
[00:45:20.607 --> 00:45:25.673]  As it ties into the Magic Moment, she actually gets indicted or the FBI director resigns because the Justice Department won't indict her.
[00:45:25.974 --> 00:45:28.657]  That is going to bring these people so close to being arrested.
[00:45:29.037 --> 00:45:34.504]  Oh, and finally, we've introduced the new product that I know is going to be the ultimate game changer.
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:37.401]  The fields are depleted.
[00:45:37.481 --> 00:45:38.262]  The food is depleted.
[00:45:38.282 --> 00:45:39.063]  The soil is depleted.
[00:45:39.263 --> 00:45:40.644]  You're not getting all the minerals you need.
[00:45:40.965 --> 00:45:42.666]  You're not getting all the vitamins you need.
[00:45:42.686 --> 00:45:44.068]  You're not getting the amino acids you need.
[00:45:44.368 --> 00:45:45.349]  This has got everything.
[00:45:45.389 --> 00:45:46.230]  I'm so proud of it.
[00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:47.431]  It tastes so good.
[00:45:47.511 --> 00:45:50.654]  It's fruit punch flavored, naturally flavored by what's already in it.
[00:45:50.674 --> 00:45:54.378]  It's got a thousand percent of what you need of vitamin C, the proper organic form.
[00:45:54.698 --> 00:45:55.399]  It's got everything.
[00:45:55.439 --> 00:45:57.220]  I'm so proud of this product.
[00:45:58.141 --> 00:46:01.642]  And again, we promote other great products, not just ours.
[00:46:01.762 --> 00:46:06.323]  But Infowarslife.com has the amazing new Vitamin Mineral Fusion available.
[00:46:06.623 --> 00:46:08.584]  Go watch the informational video, read about it.
[00:46:08.964 --> 00:46:11.945]  It's amazing and it will sell out within the next three days.
[00:46:11.965 --> 00:46:15.466]  I just want to tell everybody, we will hold some back for folks that sign up for AutoShip.
[00:46:15.766 --> 00:46:22.768]  So you can always sign up for anything that's sold out for AutoShip and still get it because we always hold back enough to cover the orders we have and then
[00:46:23.968 --> 00:46:32.533]  We have an algorithm for what we think other orders will be, so we hold back enough to make sure nothing is ever sold out when you sign up for AutoShip and you get 10% off, so another reason to do that.
[00:46:34.074 --> 00:46:35.115]  But we're so proud of this.
[00:46:35.515 --> 00:46:39.958]  And again, you can take it with other multivitamins, you can take it with other great products that are clean.
[00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:55.897]  I mean, you can't take it with other synthetic multivitamins, but you can take it with Beyond Tangy Tangerine Original and 2.0 that are both excellent as well and game changers at InfoWarsHealth.com because they're both of types that are natural, so you're able to absorb it.
[00:46:56.197 --> 00:46:57.918]  But the synthetic stuff, stay away from that.
[00:46:58.338 --> 00:46:59.018]  Do your own research.
[00:46:59.038 --> 00:46:59.839]  This is not synthetic.
[00:47:00.339 --> 00:47:09.247]  So, InfoWarsTeam.com, InfoWarsHealth.com for Beyond Tangy Tangerine and for our Vitamin Mineral Fusion that is just so delicious and I absolutely love.
[00:47:10.128 --> 00:47:10.709]  My kids love it.
[00:47:10.969 --> 00:47:11.850]  You can go to InfoWars.
[00:47:14.045 --> 00:47:14.705]  Life.com.
[00:47:14.725 --> 00:47:16.106]  But the two do not compete with each other.
[00:47:16.146 --> 00:47:17.047]  They augment each other.
[00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:19.529]  I want to be absolutely clear about that.
[00:47:19.889 --> 00:47:23.571]  Secret 12, the highest quality, organic, methylcobalamin, vitamin B12.
[00:47:23.712 --> 00:47:25.813]  If you take it under the tongue, it was sold out for months.
[00:47:26.133 --> 00:47:26.593]  Get us back.
[00:47:26.613 --> 00:47:32.617]  The reason it keeps selling out, folks, is these are so organic, so pure, so laboratory-grade, that it's hard to do.
[00:47:32.718 --> 00:47:34.459]  And it's hard to pass California standards.
[00:47:34.539 --> 00:47:37.381]  And most people, you know, say, do not pass California standards.
[00:47:38.032 --> 00:47:44.313]  Well, we're so neurotic that all of our products, except I think one of them, because they don't accept coal and silver, are California standards.
[00:47:44.353 --> 00:47:45.494]  I mean, that is so hard to do.
[00:47:45.554 --> 00:47:51.115]  So test batches get thrown out, triple testing by us after it's triple tested at the manufacturer.
[00:47:51.635 --> 00:47:57.336]  Nobody goes to our level because we want to bring you the best quality, but also we have a lot of enemies, folks.
[00:47:57.977 --> 00:47:58.937]  In government, not a government.
[00:47:58.957 --> 00:47:59.557]  We're not stupid.
[00:47:59.817 --> 00:48:03.538]  So if they want to crucify us, it's going to be without sin when it comes to these products.
[00:48:04.494 --> 00:48:10.402]  I certainly said in my life, and I'm not perfect, but you come as close to the purest, best products as you can get.
[00:48:10.422 --> 00:48:12.965]  They're so good, we don't have them half the time.
[00:48:14.047 --> 00:48:15.128]  I mean, nobody does that.
[00:48:15.789 --> 00:48:16.189]  Nobody.
[00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:20.114]  There's a reason people have dumbed-down products full of a bunch of garbage, because that's easier.
[00:48:21.016 --> 00:48:22.257]  They just put all their money into marketing.
[00:48:22.297 --> 00:48:22.878]  We don't do that.
[00:48:23.578 --> 00:48:24.679]  Our money is on the product.
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:26.201]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:48:26.601 --> 00:48:45.499]  Alright, whether you're listening to us in Rochester, New York, on Dr. Wolf's stations, whether you're listening to us on Mr. Aragorn's stations out there in Albuquerque, New Mexico, I separately want you to become a local sponsor, support the local sponsors, pay for local newspaper ads, internet ads, go on Craigslist, tell everybody about the local stations.
[00:48:47.168 --> 00:48:53.353]  Anyone of our 180 plus stations across the country and become a sponsor, put up a billboard, the fight is now, the fight is on.
[00:48:53.373 --> 00:48:56.455]  That's also key to supporting the transmission, so I want to thank you for that.
[00:48:56.816 --> 00:48:57.837]  Okay, let me stop right there.
[00:48:59.057 --> 00:48:59.998]  Let me start getting into Trump.
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:08.705]  Kasich has predicted an open convention for months, smug little arrogant creature that he is, George Soros funded, that's been confirmed.
[00:49:09.526 --> 00:49:13.289]  It's going to be so much fun, he told ABC News, to steal the vote.
[00:49:14.252 --> 00:49:16.393]  So he's out acting like it's fun.
[00:49:17.353 --> 00:49:19.034]  He's out acting like it's a great thing.
[00:49:20.675 --> 00:49:25.437]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of that, and then we're going to come back and play Trump's response.
[00:49:25.477 --> 00:49:29.159]  But this is hiding the theft of the election out in the open.
[00:49:29.199 --> 00:49:35.261]  It's like opening a door and a babysitter is having sex with your 10-year-old daughter, and you want to beat their brains out, and they say it's no big deal.
[00:49:35.562 --> 00:49:37.943]  This is hiding this stuff in plain view.
[00:49:37.983 --> 00:49:38.283]  Here it is.
[00:49:38.743 --> 00:49:44.088]  But I expect that we're going to be gaining momentum, picking up delegates, and heading into the convention.
[00:49:44.488 --> 00:49:47.451]  And George, look, there's two strong things I have going for me.
[00:49:47.671 --> 00:49:50.654]  Number one, I beat Hillary Clinton in virtually every poll.
[00:49:50.874 --> 00:49:53.117]  I'm the only one that does it on the Republican side.
[00:49:53.517 --> 00:49:55.559]  And secondly, when they look at the record,
[00:49:55.799 --> 00:50:07.367]  When they look at the record of job growth, the record of international foreign policy knowledge and experience, I believe that a convention will look at somebody like me and that's why I think I'm going to be the nominee.
[00:50:07.387 --> 00:50:09.968]  We just have to keep going and we're going to have an open convention.
[00:50:10.088 --> 00:50:13.070]  And George, you're the guy that gets open conventions.
[00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:14.311]  It's going to be so much fun.
[00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:20.775]  Kids will spend less time focusing on Bieber and Kardashian and more time focusing on how we elect presidents.
[00:50:20.855 --> 00:50:21.316]  It'll be so cool.
[00:50:22.136 --> 00:50:24.197]  Alright, this guy has almost no delegates.
[00:50:25.177 --> 00:50:33.219]  In a Indy 500 race, he is behind by 400 miles when Trump finishes.
[00:50:34.759 --> 00:50:35.959]  If his car doesn't blow up before then.
[00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:37.900]  But he's gone 50 miles.
[00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:39.520]  There's 450 miles left.
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.041]  Trump is 100 miles from the finish line.
[00:50:42.721 --> 00:50:43.541]  He is 350 miles behind right now.
[00:50:43.601 --> 00:50:44.341]  Trump is 100 miles out.
[00:50:44.361 --> 00:50:47.462]  200 miles behind him is
[00:50:51.647 --> 00:50:51.987]  Cruz.
[00:50:53.369 --> 00:50:55.071]  And they're all announcing that he's losing.
[00:50:56.012 --> 00:51:01.778]  I mean, Trump could slow down to 100 miles an hour, not 180, and win this race right now.
[00:51:02.418 --> 00:51:06.523]  But they're spinning it that, no, no, no, winning the Indy 500 doesn't mean you get the trophy.
[00:51:08.454 --> 00:51:10.395]  Are you concerned about the Power Grid?
[00:51:10.775 --> 00:51:12.755]  About the new war on the Power Grid?
[00:51:13.195 --> 00:51:18.397]  If so, this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear, and the most valuable.
[00:51:18.757 --> 00:51:19.357]  Here's why.
[00:51:19.737 --> 00:51:24.939]  An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the Power Grid has just been written.
[00:51:25.299 --> 00:51:29.160]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies.
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:32.482]  But only for a limited time to GCN listeners.
[00:51:32.722 --> 00:51:37.144]  He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[00:51:37.425 --> 00:51:42.928]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book to you.
[00:51:43.208 --> 00:51:43.868]  Why do this?
[00:51:44.149 --> 00:51:47.791]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[00:51:48.011 --> 00:51:49.071]  The answer is simple.
[00:51:49.312 --> 00:51:53.214]  America's power grid is in grave danger and most Americans are clueless.
[00:51:53.474 --> 00:51:58.597]  Find out what's going on behind the scenes and why the most common question this author gets is,
[00:51:58.857 --> 00:52:00.138]  Do you fear for your life?

[00:53:07.492 --> 00:53:10.997]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:53:11.758 --> 00:53:12.259]  It's true.
[00:53:12.379 --> 00:53:16.325]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:53:16.525 --> 00:53:18.388]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:53:18.928 --> 00:53:23.395]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[00:53:23.695 --> 00:53:36.304]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[00:54:11.843 --> 00:54:14.065]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:54:14.505 --> 00:54:16.966]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:54:17.467 --> 00:54:29.375]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:54:29.695 --> 00:54:32.156]  Ladies and gentlemen, look at the top of DrugsReport.com.
[00:54:34.558 --> 00:54:35.619]  Hell's Deals.
[00:54:35.879 --> 00:54:37.160]  Cruz moves the snatch.
[00:54:39.272 --> 00:54:40.353]  Trump's win in Arizona.
[00:54:40.993 --> 00:54:43.295]  Stories up on Infowars.com as well.
[00:54:43.315 --> 00:54:45.937]  Isn't that just sweeter than wine?
[00:54:46.578 --> 00:54:47.919]  Softer than a summer's night?
[00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:57.206]  You like being slaves, folks?
[00:54:59.428 --> 00:55:01.049]  Why shouldn't they spy on you without warrants?
[00:55:01.550 --> 00:55:02.891]  Why shouldn't they take your bank accounts?
[00:55:03.531 --> 00:55:06.694]  Why shouldn't they ship your jobs to China and get paid off by Chinese generals?
[00:55:08.041 --> 00:55:10.023]  Why shouldn't foreign leaders tell us we can't have Trump?
[00:55:11.124 --> 00:55:13.986]  Aren't we the politically correct nation that bends over when we're told to?
[00:55:16.668 --> 00:55:18.910]  Slaves until the end of time.
[00:55:19.891 --> 00:55:21.692]  Oh, isn't it cute?
[00:55:22.333 --> 00:55:23.113]  Isn't it sweet?
[00:55:24.975 --> 00:55:26.616]  Me, I'm not going quietly into the night.
[00:55:26.676 --> 00:55:27.217]  What about you?
[00:55:29.775 --> 00:55:32.137]  The globalists want countries bankrupt and controlled.
[00:55:32.617 --> 00:55:33.738]  They've done it to Argentina.
[00:55:33.778 --> 00:55:35.319]  That's the closest model to the U.S.
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:37.181]  As wealthy as the U.S.
[00:55:37.361 --> 00:55:38.322]  on average or more.
[00:55:38.842 --> 00:55:41.344]  Until about 65 years ago when they took the country down.
[00:55:41.604 --> 00:55:44.206]  When the globalists came in and set up the same scams they're doing here.
[00:55:46.008 --> 00:55:50.351]  Why should you have a country that produces when you can just be mega banks that come in and run the country into the ground?
[00:55:50.451 --> 00:55:51.792]  We're going into bondage.
[00:55:52.913 --> 00:55:57.697]  And now, they get up there on TV and go, like Kasich, it's gonna be a lot of fun.
[00:55:59.622 --> 00:56:06.828]  Let's use not a Formula One car analogy of the Indy 500, let's use the Daytona 500 for NASCAR.
[00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:20.960]  You win the 500 mile race and second place, this never happens but this is the way this is, is 180 miles behind you.
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:22.201]  That's where this is looking.
[00:56:23.642 --> 00:56:23.982]  Maybe 200 miles.
[00:56:24.002 --> 00:56:25.323]  Kasich is 375 miles, if he does well.
[00:56:29.875 --> 00:56:33.902]  And he says he's gonna get the trophy, this is gonna be a lot of fun, your kids are gonna love watching this.
[00:56:34.343 --> 00:56:36.787]  They've never done something like this before.
[00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:42.276]  But they're selling, hoping we're ignorant, going, of course your popular vote doesn't count, silly!
[00:56:44.793 --> 00:56:45.734]  Silly kids!
[00:56:46.514 --> 00:56:47.595]  Votes aren't for voting!
[00:56:48.175 --> 00:56:56.499]  All the media making billions of dollars off the ratings and watching and the debates and you choose your vote and, oh, this state goes to Trump!
[00:56:56.699 --> 00:56:57.400]  This state goes to Trump!
[00:56:57.860 --> 00:56:59.501]  Texas goes to Cruz!
[00:56:59.801 --> 00:57:00.962]  Oh, does Trump come take his delegates?
[00:57:01.042 --> 00:57:01.522]  Oh, no, no, no.
[00:57:03.083 --> 00:57:06.204]  But Tennessee goes to Trump and the state goes to Cruz.
[00:57:06.645 --> 00:57:08.786]  Louisiana goes to Trump, it goes to Cruz.
[00:57:08.846 --> 00:57:10.727]  Arizona goes to Trump, goes to Cruz!
[00:57:12.685 --> 00:57:21.072]  And Cruz gets up there and talks slower and slower like Obama now and goes, you know, I've got Jeb Bush supporting me now.
[00:57:21.112 --> 00:57:23.774]  He's like trying to act like John Wayne or something.
[00:57:23.814 --> 00:57:25.295]  It's this fake manly thing they do.
[00:57:26.976 --> 00:57:36.864]  Well, you know, I've got the Republicans behind me now, Jeb Bush and others, and I'm going to take the delegates at the convention and I'm going to win.
[00:57:39.514 --> 00:57:41.615]  And he just smiles with that weird vampire face.
[00:57:41.635 --> 00:57:47.099]  And we're all supposed to just bow down to the wooden man and, okay, great, thank you.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:49.121]  Boy, Trump's a racist, didn't you hear?
[00:57:49.141 --> 00:57:54.384]  And you got all the savings and loan, Neil and Marvin Bush hammers.
[00:57:54.404 --> 00:57:55.805]  I mean, you cannot get worse.
[00:57:56.266 --> 00:58:00.509]  The sons and grandsons of the top Nazi collaborator.
[00:58:03.211 --> 00:58:04.732]  They're one of the richest families in the world, folks.
[00:58:04.792 --> 00:58:07.974]  All that Nazi wealth that went to Argentina, Chile, Brazil.
[00:58:09.833 --> 00:58:12.094]  It's in the Bush bank account.
[00:58:12.294 --> 00:58:13.274]  It's in the bank account.
[00:58:14.495 --> 00:58:15.815]  And you heard that Johnny Cash song?
[00:58:16.375 --> 00:58:17.876]  He's in the jailhouse now.
[00:58:18.316 --> 00:58:19.396]  He's in the jailhouse now.
[00:58:19.636 --> 00:58:20.397]  Not the jailhouse.
[00:58:20.917 --> 00:58:25.879]  He's in the banker house now with the big giant rooms full of gold and diamonds and art and rubies.
[00:58:25.919 --> 00:58:28.660]  That's where it all went to these guys and they run the country.
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:31.400]  Oh, let's make this young man the head of the CIA out of nowhere.
[00:58:31.581 --> 00:58:33.141]  Here, let's just make him president next.
[00:58:33.361 --> 00:58:33.901]  Wonder why?
[00:58:33.921 --> 00:58:35.422]  Because they got the treasure hoard.
[00:58:37.153 --> 00:58:37.793]  Yay!
[00:58:37.853 --> 00:58:40.755]  And it's okay if they're Nazi collaborators because the left has theirs!
[00:58:40.995 --> 00:58:41.795]  George Soros!
[00:58:42.075 --> 00:58:42.695]  Yay!
[00:58:42.715 --> 00:58:44.876]  We're going to come back with Trump's response to all this.
[00:58:44.896 --> 00:58:45.337]  Stay with us.

[00:59:48.575 --> 00:59:54.738]  So many people call into my radio show and tell me how Longevity and the products at Infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[00:59:54.878 --> 00:59:56.199]  Check it out for yourself today.
[00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:02.487]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:10.603 --> 01:00:16.625]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:17.245 --> 01:00:20.266]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:22.087 --> 01:00:25.748]  So, John Kasich, who almost has no delegates.
[01:00:26.208 --> 01:00:35.952]  Like I said, if he was in the Daytona Speedway in a race, he would... He'd be like maybe a hundred miles at the end of the race into it.
[01:00:36.852 --> 01:00:38.792]  With Trump at 500, Ted Cruz at 300 or so.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:43.263]  And they're just trying to spin the idea that all this is okay.
[01:00:43.683 --> 01:00:45.044]  And then Trump responded to that.
[01:00:45.365 --> 01:00:53.512]  As Ted Cruz comes out and they say is set to win Arizona, you know, weeks ago, Trump won by a huge percentage.
[01:00:53.552 --> 01:00:54.133]  Doesn't matter.
[01:00:54.153 --> 01:00:59.378]  Because the Republican establishment already had the quote superdelegates in there.
[01:00:59.638 --> 01:01:03.822]  So they bring the delegates together and then they just say, okay, well, we're going to go for Cruz now.
[01:01:06.004 --> 01:01:12.148]  And then CNN, MSNBC, they all ask, why do we even have elections then?
[01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:14.029]  And they go, that's a good question.
[01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:16.811]  Just permanent rule like China by the inner party.
[01:01:16.871 --> 01:01:18.352]  They appoint their successors.
[01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:23.356]  And then they even have MSNBC and others acting like I'm a kook.
[01:01:23.396 --> 01:01:29.640]  There were, I don't want to exaggerate, I saw 10 articles in BuzzFeed and Alternet and
[01:01:31.178 --> 01:01:44.941]  Y'all, all the usual media matters, all the usual suspects, basically implying I'm crazy, that I don't want them to take it from Trump, and that it's normal, and that I want riots or something with Roger Stone.
[01:01:46.681 --> 01:01:51.342]  Oh, how dare us say we're gonna go be at Cleveland because they're announcing they're gonna steal it and then protest that.
[01:01:51.382 --> 01:01:56.824]  Can you imagine having our popular vote stolen and we would engage in the First Amendment?
[01:01:56.944 --> 01:01:58.884]  Oh, I guess that never existed either, right?
[01:02:02.534 --> 01:02:06.176]  Just like millions of people, millions of people the last 20 years.
[01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:07.757]  This was going on when I first got on air.
[01:02:07.777 --> 01:02:08.897]  People would bring me the court filings.
[01:02:08.917 --> 01:02:09.377]  They'd show me.
[01:02:09.958 --> 01:02:12.779]  Mr. Jones, my mother owned the house.
[01:02:12.799 --> 01:02:14.060]  When she died, she gave it to me.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.981]  I've lived there with my wife 10 years.
[01:02:16.001 --> 01:02:17.061]  I remember having these people on.
[01:02:17.382 --> 01:02:21.284]  Look, the deed was paid off in 1972.
[01:02:22.784 --> 01:02:24.445]  This bank never had a deed.
[01:02:26.766 --> 01:02:31.489]  It's homesteaded under the state of Texas and they came and they took the house.
[01:02:32.478 --> 01:02:33.779]  It's a fraud, Mr. Jones!
[01:02:33.799 --> 01:02:35.961]  They file fraudulent, they take houses!
[01:02:36.501 --> 01:02:47.589]  And I'd have these guys in with their lawyers, and I'd be reading it, I'd show it to my dad, I'd show it to lawyers, and lawyers would be like, you don't want to mess with that, boy, those courts are, yeah, when you get into property, you don't want to stay out of that.
[01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:52.273]  We'd go down to the county tax assessor and interview her, catch her in the hallway,
[01:02:53.208 --> 01:02:56.929]  Nelda Spears was her name, and we go, you're taking old people's houses.
[01:02:57.569 --> 01:02:58.990]  She goes, we don't take houses.
[01:02:59.230 --> 01:03:00.770]  And I cut people having their houses taken.
[01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:02.371]  I go, well, you sell them on the courthouse steps.
[01:03:02.391 --> 01:03:04.111]  She goes, we don't do that.
[01:03:05.872 --> 01:03:07.152]  No, we don't, Mr. Jones.
[01:03:07.512 --> 01:03:10.353]  And I go, well, you're allowing banks to take houses they don't even have the deed to.
[01:03:10.873 --> 01:03:11.933]  No, we don't.
[01:03:12.693 --> 01:03:15.234]  And then running down the hall, here'd come the SWAT team.
[01:03:15.954 --> 01:03:17.335]  They get up against me, start bumping into me.
[01:03:17.355 --> 01:03:19.956]  In fact, that's on video.
[01:03:19.976 --> 01:03:21.336]  My cancer's gonna dig that stuff out.
[01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:24.855]  SWAT team running up, bumping into me.
[01:03:27.658 --> 01:03:31.641]  And then I would go up in their office and preach at them a couple times, and then by the end of it they would apologize.
[01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:34.944]  And then of course they fired the SWAT team and brought in somebody else.
[01:03:35.864 --> 01:03:37.145]  But who knows, he might be a nice guy.
[01:03:37.205 --> 01:03:41.849]  One time I was eating in the cafeteria by myself, and the Travis County SWAT team head guy comes over and goes, Alex, how you doing?
[01:03:41.909 --> 01:03:42.910]  And started talking to me.
[01:03:43.791 --> 01:03:46.433]  I was just like, whatever man, I don't want your job, that's all I know.
[01:03:47.554 --> 01:03:48.475]  Anyways, I don't mean to digress.
[01:03:48.655 --> 01:03:50.997]  Let's go to this Donald Trump clip responding to Kay Securitas.
[01:03:51.664 --> 01:03:53.406]  Why is a guy allowed to run?
[01:03:54.366 --> 01:03:58.270]  All he's doing is just he goes from place to place and loses and he keeps running.
[01:03:58.690 --> 01:04:00.452]  Well, why doesn't Marco Rubio do that?
[01:04:00.492 --> 01:04:01.733]  Why doesn't Jeb Bush do that?
[01:04:01.813 --> 01:04:03.014]  Why didn't all of them do that?
[01:04:03.414 --> 01:04:05.116]  After it was their time.
[01:04:05.176 --> 01:04:10.360]  Now, if he wants to go and have his name put in nomination in the conventions, in the convention, he can do that.
[01:04:10.961 --> 01:04:14.724]  He doesn't have to run and take my votes because he's taking my votes.
[01:04:14.744 --> 01:04:15.925]  He's not taking Cruz's votes.
[01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:17.006]  He's taking my votes.
[01:04:18.115 --> 01:04:20.817]  Again, that's Trump doing an impromptu cafe TV interview.
[01:04:20.837 --> 01:04:25.179]  I love the fact that he'll just randomly let some lady or guy with an iPhone interview him for two minutes.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.582]  I mean, that's a really positive, positive, positive thing about Trump.
[01:04:31.362 --> 01:04:39.647]  Look at this headline, and I've told folks about this, I've read about it, I've experienced it, I've seen it down there at the Guatemalan border, but Mexico tortures migrants, citizens in an effort to slow
[01:04:40.785 --> 01:04:41.745]  Central American surge.
[01:04:41.765 --> 01:04:45.847]  They actually give you six months to a year hard labor, and they torture you.
[01:04:47.248 --> 01:04:49.289]  But Mexico says we've got to let everybody in.
[01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:51.930]  Hey, I'm all for letting folks in.
[01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:54.851]  They just can't get babies paid for for free and stuff.
[01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.932]  I mean, Mexico doesn't let you do that.
[01:04:57.072 --> 01:04:58.093]  China doesn't let you do that.
[01:04:58.113 --> 01:05:07.137]  But see, you've got all these Spanish-speaking TV channels run by the globalists just selling this hoax that we've got to open the border.
[01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:13.788]  A leaked memo reveals how the Trump campaign really feels about the establishment.
[01:05:14.068 --> 01:05:24.450]  An internal memo leaked to the Washington Post reveals the level of disdain that Trump has for the political establishment and their talking heads in the mainstream media.
[01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:36.612]  The memo, entitled, Digging Through the Bulls**t, is written by Donald Trump's senior advisor, Barry Bennett, who said the mainstream media and Washington establishment are working together like never before.
[01:05:36.912 --> 01:05:43.697]  To bash the Trump campaign as the networks have labeled last week the worst week ever for Donald Trump.
[01:05:43.817 --> 01:05:48.460]  And they are proclaiming that the end is near for his presidential campaign.
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:55.325]  The memo goes on to point out the disconnect between Trump's rising popularity and the media talking points.
[01:05:55.765 --> 01:06:02.610]  Another pathetic display by the so-called experts who line their pockets at the expense of our candidates
[01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:03.730]  And causes.
[01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:06.251]  You can learn more right now at Infowars.com.
[01:06:06.431 --> 01:06:08.552]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:06:08.612 --> 01:06:09.032]  Good, brother.
[01:06:09.192 --> 01:06:10.892]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:06:11.132 --> 01:06:12.673]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:06:12.853 --> 01:06:16.894]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:06:16.914 --> 01:06:19.455]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:06:19.495 --> 01:06:21.736]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:06:21.936 --> 01:06:29.778]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.

[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:34.861]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:06:34.881 --> 01:06:37.782]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:06:37.802 --> 01:06:39.283]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:06:39.563 --> 01:06:42.044]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[01:06:42.304 --> 01:06:45.366]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[01:06:45.626 --> 01:06:47.227]  Or maximum potency.
[01:06:47.407 --> 01:06:53.569]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience.
[01:06:53.869 --> 01:06:57.550]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:59.371]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[01:08:04.894 --> 01:08:11.958]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:12.518 --> 01:08:15.300]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.062 --> 01:08:31.931]  Leaked memo reveals how the Donald Trump campaign really feels about mainstream media.
[01:08:34.005 --> 01:08:34.806]  And the government.
[01:08:34.846 --> 01:08:38.809]  We're going to be breaking that down in this hour.
[01:08:39.730 --> 01:08:48.337]  We also have a lot of really, really big reports out there that we're going to be going over, dealing with this so-called biggest WikiLeaks-style data dump ever.
[01:08:48.377 --> 01:08:52.760]  When I first saw this yesterday, I said, it's going to be low-level groups trying to protect their money.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.221]  It's going to be the Russian networks.
[01:08:55.542 --> 01:08:59.506]  As soon as I saw that they were going after that soccer, that international football group,
[01:09:00.799 --> 01:09:18.355]  This is the big mega banks that control trillions, that create trillions in derivatives, that engage in all forms of drug dealing, money laundering, child kidnapping, white slavery, overthrow of governments, 5 billion to overthrow Ukraine, 5 billion to the rebels in Syria.
[01:09:19.861 --> 01:09:29.830]  This is the most corrupt group you can imagine simply leaking this to the Germans, handing it out to a hundred different newspapers or more in the last year to quote vet it.
[01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:35.855]  No, that was to make sure that it didn't connect to any Western operations and to cherry pick what to go after.
[01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:39.511]  And sure enough, it's in the news today.
[01:09:39.671 --> 01:09:44.234]  They're saying this is a selective leak by the West against other networks they don't control.
[01:09:44.855 --> 01:09:45.495]  This is how it works.
[01:09:45.555 --> 01:09:50.058]  You get Arthur Anderson previously, or now it's another big accounting firm that the former Attorney General runs.
[01:09:51.179 --> 01:09:53.000]  Then you can have offshore accounts.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.561]  Then you cannot pay taxes.
[01:09:54.601 --> 01:10:03.947]  They certify it and the government doesn't touch it because it's full of vice presidents, former presidents on their boards, former attorney generals, former FBI directors.
[01:10:04.928 --> 01:10:06.429]  There's only two or three of these firms in D.C.
[01:10:08.109 --> 01:10:08.970]  Like Arthur Anderson.
[01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.750]  And then you're left alone.
[01:10:10.050 --> 01:10:12.391]  Now the law says you can have an offshore bank account.
[01:10:12.432 --> 01:10:15.633]  The law says you can go to the Cayman Islands or Switzerland or Luxembourg.
[01:10:17.194 --> 01:10:20.256]  But when they want to, they will come and shake you down and arrest you.
[01:10:21.277 --> 01:10:30.382]  This is a model of global government where you have the FBI going out and arresting the leadership of the International Football League, of the International Soccer League.
[01:10:31.226 --> 01:10:39.349]  This is global governance, and I'm going to go over that later in the hour with our guest and get his view on it, because he's an expert on people going offshore and more.
[01:10:40.150 --> 01:10:44.932]  But Wikileaks reveals IMF plan to cause a credit event in Greece and destabilize Europe.
[01:10:45.012 --> 01:10:45.752]  Don't forget that.
[01:10:47.677 --> 01:10:49.197]  The French elite, where it went wrong.
[01:10:49.317 --> 01:10:51.618]  Financial Times admitting they don't pay taxes themselves.
[01:10:51.678 --> 01:10:54.498]  French billionaire to SALT to face trial for tax fraud.
[01:10:55.358 --> 01:10:57.799]  Chinese newspaper editor resigns over media control.
[01:10:58.119 --> 01:11:01.760]  Associated Press willfully cooperated with the Nazis to show how they're controlled.
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:05.380]  Top German journalist admits mainstream media is completely fake.
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:08.261]  We quote, all lie for the CIA in Germany.
[01:11:09.061 --> 01:11:10.741]  It's a whole bunch of their biggest reporters coming out.
[01:11:11.221 --> 01:11:12.062]  Why is that important?
[01:11:12.082 --> 01:11:14.242]  Because when it comes out of Germany particularly,
[01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:19.532]  People see Germany as like, oh, modern, liberal, you can really trust it.
[01:11:20.152 --> 01:11:23.915]  It's the worst garbage you'll ever find.
[01:11:25.055 --> 01:11:39.644]  Some of their news is accurate, if you research it, but general scandal news is really coming out of the CIA, out of the MI6, out of Israel, out of other groups, but they fence it through Germany, because somehow they have credibility.
[01:11:39.864 --> 01:11:41.145]  They never got over being occupied.
[01:11:42.432 --> 01:11:47.434]  High earners say goodbye to France, so again, they want this international tax grab.
[01:11:47.794 --> 01:11:59.698]  Tax traders widen division in belt-tightening France, and now they're trying to blame Russia for $2 billion in the quote, biggest scandal ever with this Panama data dump, the Panama Papers.
[01:12:00.678 --> 01:12:01.238]  $2 billion?
[01:12:01.298 --> 01:12:02.519]  I mean, that is nothing.
[01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:05.760]  You know how many trillions exchange hands in the currency markets every day?
[01:12:06.687 --> 01:12:15.396]  The rigged stock markets, the rigged credit default swaps, the rigged currency, the rigged interest rates, all of it.
[01:12:16.997 --> 01:12:19.119]  They admit it's all rigged is what's crazy.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:30.431]  Just like they've tried to steal elections, they've manipulated them before, but never come right out and said, we're going to put Paul Ryan in, this is Karl Rove last week, even if he doesn't have one delegate.
[01:12:31.383 --> 01:12:37.166]  And Kasich is showing his wares, saying, you know, it doesn't matter if he's only got a few, he deserves to win.
[01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:40.708]  I don't know what you call this coming out in the open.
[01:12:41.989 --> 01:12:44.431]  Is this really the fall of America, the fall of the West?
[01:12:45.171 --> 01:12:48.293]  Or is this a PSYOP to prepare us for just anything?
[01:12:48.693 --> 01:12:52.795]  Because when things get this crazy in history, you go over the edge of a cliff.
[01:12:52.875 --> 01:12:54.616]  Are we going over the edge of the cliff right now?
[01:12:55.557 --> 01:12:57.058]  Have we reached the event horizon?
[01:12:58.353 --> 01:12:59.674]  We're going to talk geopolitics.
[01:12:59.694 --> 01:13:00.594]  We're going to talk Syria.
[01:13:00.614 --> 01:13:01.455]  We're going to talk Iran.
[01:13:01.755 --> 01:13:03.496]  We're going to talk Ukraine.
[01:13:03.716 --> 01:13:04.656]  We're going to talk Obama.
[01:13:04.676 --> 01:13:07.258]  We're going to talk Black Lives Matter and the destabilization program.
[01:13:07.898 --> 01:13:12.180]  We're going to talk the entire waterfront, 2016 and beyond.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.241]  But first off, I don't know his view.
[01:13:14.601 --> 01:13:18.904]  I follow his articles, but he's pretty libertarian, conservative, apolitical, though.
[01:13:18.924 --> 01:13:20.324]  He just does analysis of the world.
[01:13:20.825 --> 01:13:22.746]  Best-selling nonfiction author.
[01:13:22.806 --> 01:13:24.487]  Best-selling fiction author.
[01:13:25.407 --> 01:13:31.050]  James Wesley Rawls is an American novelist and blogger who is best known for his recently completed Patriots novel series.
[01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:32.230]  Rawls is a former U.S.
[01:13:32.311 --> 01:13:33.331]  Army intelligence officer.
[01:13:33.651 --> 01:13:40.855]  He is the founder of the senior editor of SurvivalBlog.com, which is one of the top sites in the world with tens of millions of visitors a month.
[01:13:41.235 --> 01:13:46.998]  For the past 10 years, he's covered survival and preparedness topics from a constitutional Christian libertarian perspective.
[01:13:47.378 --> 01:13:49.219]  His latest novel is titled Land of Promise.
[01:13:49.239 --> 01:13:50.160]  He's got another one coming out, too.
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:53.462]  The first book in the Counter Caliphate Chronicle series.
[01:13:53.803 --> 01:13:58.906]  This novel, set two decades in the future, describes the establishment of a Christian nation under siege.
[01:13:58.946 --> 01:14:03.570]  Now, I could do three hours with this guy, because I got a lot to say, a lot of angles to cover.
[01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:09.954]  He's only on to the bottom of the next hour, but I want to invite him back in a few weeks for a part two, for two full hours, because he was willing to do it today.
[01:14:09.994 --> 01:14:10.595]  He's a busy guy.
[01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:15.011]  Because I've got my reporters popping in for the last 30 minutes of the next hour.
[01:14:15.431 --> 01:14:17.492]  I may push them, though, up to David Knight, though.
[01:14:17.852 --> 01:14:18.893]  We'll see how this goes.
[01:14:18.953 --> 01:14:21.934]  But I just threw out that menu of what I want to cover.
[01:14:21.974 --> 01:14:25.295]  But front and center is, what is this caliphate plan?
[01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:32.038]  Why would the West be bold enough to bring in 5 million people they know, many of which are military-age men and are jihadis?
[01:14:33.544 --> 01:14:38.108]  Will they carry out attacks and then martial law comes in like areas of Europe have already done?
[01:14:39.129 --> 01:14:44.133]  And how will our political elite get away with bringing them in and then having them attack us?
[01:14:44.193 --> 01:14:47.376]  Is that part of this victory over logic and common sense?
[01:14:47.956 --> 01:14:53.581]  Just like, in effect, they're suspending the election by stealing Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump's delegates.
[01:14:54.742 --> 01:14:55.063]  Openly.
[01:14:55.854 --> 01:14:57.374]  I mean, we're really entering a new phase.
[01:14:57.475 --> 01:14:58.315]  Is this bravado?
[01:14:58.675 --> 01:14:59.495]  Is this arrogance?
[01:14:59.615 --> 01:15:00.695]  Is this megalomania?
[01:15:01.016 --> 01:15:03.236]  Or is this a desperate attempt to look confident?
[01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:05.137]  I've thrown out a lot there.
[01:15:06.037 --> 01:15:08.298]  James Wesley Rawls, survivalblog.com.
[01:15:08.898 --> 01:15:10.979]  We're going to break here in about 15 minutes.
[01:15:10.999 --> 01:15:11.859]  You've got the floor.
[01:15:12.259 --> 01:15:16.060]  Tell us where you want to start first and what you think is currently happening.
[01:15:17.181 --> 01:15:20.582]  Well, Alex, I think looking at it from a 30,000 foot view,
[01:15:22.921 --> 01:15:45.934]  What we have in the global geopolitical realm is with the end of the Cold War, the powers that be needed to have a continued destabilization as an excuse for carrying on with all of their banking shenanigans, their massive military buildups and so forth.
[01:15:47.668 --> 01:16:01.739]  They, in effect, through Osama Bin Laden and other Islamic leaders, that they supported, the CIA itself created ISIS, as you've pointed out many times.
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.581]  They want destabilization.
[01:16:06.202 --> 01:16:16.990]  They are hoping that they can walk the tightrope of destabilization to the point where they can continue to consolidate power
[01:16:17.768 --> 01:16:42.527]  With a massively centralized government, with an electronic currency replacing physical currency, and with the whole statist agenda by building up the Islamic threat and then hoping to counter that threat, all the time accumulating more power and wealth for themselves.
[01:16:43.268 --> 01:16:58.500]  But what I'm afraid is going to happen is that they are going to over destabilize and they will, in effect, create their own downfall and perhaps the downfall of all the Western nations in the process.
[01:16:59.401 --> 01:17:07.767]  They're hoping that they can kind of lock that tightrope and carry on year after year after year.
[01:17:08.968 --> 01:17:12.391]  But I'm afraid it's going to come back and blow up in their face because
[01:17:12.921 --> 01:17:28.009]  A lot of these terrorist groups that they have created don't have any compunctions at all against using true weapons of mass destruction so that Wall Street itself may be the next Ground Zero.
[01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:37.675]  And their best laid plans of these totalitarian wannabes is going to come back and haunt them.
[01:17:39.059 --> 01:17:40.563]  Well, you just crystallized it perfectly.
[01:17:40.583 --> 01:17:43.632]  I want you to continue, but I just want to back up, sir, what you were just saying.
[01:17:45.501 --> 01:17:48.822]  Obviously, I know you're retired, but you've talked to a lot of your sources in government.
[01:17:48.922 --> 01:17:52.584]  I have amazing sources, high-level, in government, but also out.
[01:17:53.144 --> 01:17:54.965]  People say, well, I mean, how do you do that?
[01:17:54.985 --> 01:17:55.925]  They're going out for whistleblowers.
[01:17:56.526 --> 01:17:59.047]  Things are so bad now that mainly the U.S.
[01:17:59.147 --> 01:18:09.631]  Army, strangely enough, that's just historical, one of the oldest institutions in this country, has been the main group inside the Pentagon saying no to Syria, no to all these events, no to double-crossing Egypt.
[01:18:10.371 --> 01:18:13.413]  And they are basically telling the neocons, the left,
[01:18:14.193 --> 01:18:28.960]  And the socialists, you better stop it, and there's such a socialist vein in this godless, atheist, New World Order culture that really the only ideology they have is destroy the better clingers, destroy the farms, collectivize everything under corporate control.
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:33.361]  You know, a type of high-tech, fascist, Great Leap Forward.
[01:18:34.222 --> 01:18:36.363]  Not communist, but fascist more like.
[01:18:36.883 --> 01:18:40.765]  And that they're blowing the engine that made the globalists have a major command base
[01:18:41.661 --> 01:18:51.890]  And that the military, not even because the top brass and statisticians are angels, but because they want to keep playing golf and don't want their grandkids killed, they're saying stop it right now.
[01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:59.997]  You're about to bring civilization down by crisis creation because you keep getting more power out of crises, but at a certain point this black hole is going to swallow you.
[01:19:00.257 --> 01:19:09.305]  Now that message you just kind of threw out is the message I've been getting for about six years from high-level Pentagon people and others that obviously use this show as a conduit to warn people.
[01:19:09.645 --> 01:19:13.029]  But now, even down to low-level enlisted officers, they know.
[01:19:13.450 --> 01:19:15.172]  The military, basically, has been warned.
[01:19:15.812 --> 01:19:17.554]  About 90% of the Army's on board.
[01:19:17.574 --> 01:19:19.637]  About 60% of the Marines are on board.
[01:19:19.957 --> 01:19:22.140]  About 60% of the Navy knows what's going on.
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.202]  For whatever reason, the Navy's not doing too good waking up.
[01:19:24.883 --> 01:19:26.725]  That's just kind of a dead reckoning number.
[01:19:27.626 --> 01:19:43.701]  But this is really a big deal where you almost have a Mexican standoff between institutions in our government, newer more corrupt private contractor institutions and delusional people like Hillary and Samantha Powers and Obama who have no idea what they're doing and watch SportsCenter all day.
[01:19:44.041 --> 01:19:50.908]  At least Hitler was in a bunker when he was endangering his whole country and doing super dangerous stuff and knew he could lose and had been in the military.
[01:19:51.488 --> 01:19:56.394]  These people are completely out of their minds, and it really is frightening to see them not knowing what they're doing.
[01:19:56.915 --> 01:19:58.637]  And is that what you're basically coming down to?
[01:20:00.159 --> 01:20:10.372]  Yes, I agree with you, Alex, that there is a level of self-delusion that now exists amongst the powers that be that's unprecedented.
[01:20:11.409 --> 01:20:26.146]  And their level of control over the economy, over the stock markets, manipulating the derivatives market, manipulating the precious metals market, which is a very thin market, the level of control they have is frightening.
[01:20:27.328 --> 01:20:30.351]  And again, it's likely to come back and blow up in their faces.
[01:20:31.408 --> 01:20:33.790]  And it's the law of unintended consequences.
[01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:46.899]  So for many years, you've talked about the Hegelian dialectic, and it's been employed heavily for the last seven years under the Obama administration.
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:54.765]  And my fear is that regardless of who comes in in the next administration,
[01:20:55.512 --> 01:21:15.301]  We're probably going to see a statist of some sort who's going to want to continue playing the same game, playing the same political games, playing pressure groups off of one another, trying to increase divisiveness within our own country.
[01:21:16.181 --> 01:21:27.155]  By bringing in almost uncontrolled immigration of Islamists who are not going to be properly vetted at all.
[01:21:28.596 --> 01:21:34.363]  And in fact, right now there seems to be a preference within the US State Department
[01:21:35.385 --> 01:21:38.807]  to bring in Islamists rather than persecuted Christians.
[01:21:39.107 --> 01:21:40.888]  So what does that tell us?
[01:21:41.228 --> 01:21:44.089]  It tells us that they want a lack of stability.
[01:21:44.650 --> 01:21:54.775]  They want to put people at odds with one another to create friction and out of that friction
[01:21:55.967 --> 01:21:58.888]  They're, you know, it's the Hegelian dialectic again.
[01:21:58.908 --> 01:22:11.070]  They create the crisis and out of that crisis comes their solution which is all stage managed to fill their coffers and to build political power.
[01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:22.053]  And then under their Agenda 21 depopulation program they codify the cosmology of us being poor and them being rich as their guardians
[01:22:23.346 --> 01:22:43.382]  Uh, getting rid of the scourge of humanity, all perfectly scripted, where they play savior of the earth, while they literally block industrialization, block systems that would set up a two... two-child family, with all the actuaries we know that lead towards stabilization, global prosperity,
[01:22:44.679 --> 01:22:53.042]  and a new renaissance and they themselves going back even to Bertrand Russell and the non-fiction books of H.G.
[01:22:53.062 --> 01:23:03.485]  Wells and Galton and all the rest of them admit a hundred years ago that they were going to have to block a new renaissance and quote kill a lot of beautiful and gallant people to quote H.G.
[01:23:03.525 --> 01:23:10.387]  Wells to get their new world order and even wrote the book and had the movie things to come the movie came out in the early thirties
[01:23:11.343 --> 01:23:16.728]  Where they set up a world government run by a UN that flies around in giant B-2 style bombers.
[01:23:17.108 --> 01:23:18.429]  Actually shows B-2 bombers.
[01:23:19.050 --> 01:23:19.270]  Right.
[01:23:19.350 --> 01:23:25.435]  Nervegassing nation states and taking the guns from the people and depopulating the planet.
[01:23:26.336 --> 01:23:37.286]  I mean these people are completely out of their minds but the thing is they've got control because the British Empire got behind them and funded this wild dream and Mr. Rawls looks like they're pretty much getting there.
[01:23:37.306 --> 01:23:38.187]  Do you think they'll succeed?
[01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:40.571]  It seems like it.
[01:23:41.232 --> 01:23:42.513]  You mentioned H.G.
[01:23:42.553 --> 01:23:43.694]  Wells and Things to Come.
[01:23:44.214 --> 01:23:48.218]  He was a socialist, but he was very prescient about what might happen.
[01:23:49.019 --> 01:23:52.542]  And you'll notice that in the storyline of Things to Come,
[01:23:54.004 --> 01:24:07.256]  The way that they were able to create their global governance was out of the aftermath of a global socioeconomic collapse following war after war after war.
[01:24:07.636 --> 01:24:09.318]  It looks a lot like what we're seeing right now.
[01:24:11.570 --> 01:24:21.579]  And that's why his boss, as you know, anybody can look this up, the letters, the writings are public, the man that basically took the British Empire and folded it into the U.S.
[01:24:21.759 --> 01:24:26.684]  Empire, Cecil Rhodes and the Rhodes Scholars envision the whole plan we're currently living under.
[01:24:28.785 --> 01:24:34.450]  Yeah, and ironically, the legacy of Cecil Rhodes
[01:24:35.345 --> 01:24:41.068]  was is now being protested in South Africa.
[01:24:42.349 --> 01:24:53.255]  They don't want anything to do with any of the colonialist, any of that history.
[01:24:53.295 --> 01:25:00.740]  They're literally tearing down statues in South Africa at the universities right now.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:02.521]  Cecil Rhodes
[01:25:03.621 --> 01:25:13.746]  really had a view not just for the African continent, not just as they said in those days, Cape to Cairo, but for the whole world.
[01:25:14.867 --> 01:25:24.231]  And a lot of his proteges ended up creating organizations like the CFR and the Trilateral Commission and so forth.
[01:25:24.871 --> 01:25:25.512]  Years later,
[01:25:26.525 --> 01:25:47.015]  It's all been an almost uninterrupted chain of this quest for global dominance, global control, and they've very wisely co-opted the educational system, the mass media, and the banking system.
[01:25:47.035 --> 01:25:48.536]  And let's be clear, no further.
[01:25:48.696 --> 01:25:50.937]  Again, you're getting the inside scoop here, listeners.
[01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:53.751]  Cecil Rhodes, all the rest of it.
[01:25:54.412 --> 01:26:10.205]  They even said, and he wrote, you can read it, a hundred years ago, we will then even finally get rid of the trappings of the empire, the flags, the statues, the parades, the uniforms, and it'll be invisible through our corporate interlocking directorates like the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:26:10.865 --> 01:26:32.542]  And it'll be multinational, and now that's why at Oxford and places, they're supporting, you know, pulling down bust of the Queen, and that's why Obama sent back the bust of Churchill, is because they're going to even let the socialists and leftists pull that down, and believe they've defeated it, when they've actually are helping it bring in the next phase, the end of free speech.
[01:26:32.802 --> 01:26:34.483]  I mean, these folks are so sophisticated.
[01:26:36.545 --> 01:26:37.226]  It is indeed.
[01:26:39.915 --> 01:26:58.915]  It's worth mentioning that 20 years ago, the socialists in England turned their own flag, the Union Jack, into a supposed symbol of racism and colonialism.
[01:27:00.447 --> 01:27:08.533]  And they declared that the Union Jack couldn't be used in political rallies and protests.
[01:27:08.553 --> 01:27:08.893]  That's right.
[01:27:08.973 --> 01:27:10.214]  In fact, the police tried to arrest you.
[01:27:10.995 --> 01:27:11.175]  Right.
[01:27:12.036 --> 01:27:13.097]  That was 20 years ago.
[01:27:13.557 --> 01:27:17.300]  And at the time, I was in shock and disbelief that that could happen.
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:24.085]  But right now, in America, we're on the verge of that happening with our own American flag.
[01:27:25.521 --> 01:27:25.921]  Exactly.
[01:27:25.941 --> 01:27:27.503]  They start with the rebel battle flag.
[01:27:27.523 --> 01:27:29.965]  It has nothing to do with slavery, but ignorant people are told so.
[01:27:30.406 --> 01:27:32.567]  So what if some toothless racists drive around with it?
[01:27:32.607 --> 01:27:33.588]  It's not what it symbolizes.
[01:27:34.169 --> 01:27:35.951]  And then now they want the American flag.
[01:27:36.011 --> 01:27:40.114]  And to expand on that, that was only one symbol of empire.
[01:27:40.134 --> 01:27:41.435]  The globalists have conquered.
[01:27:42.196 --> 01:27:48.658]  The Rothschilds owners have conquered England, they're using that model and the people they use to enforce it upon the world.
[01:27:48.738 --> 01:28:05.742]  It's moved on from England, it's still based there to a certain extent, but now they're demonizing anything Western, when it's England that ended slavery worldwide, it's England that brought forward the abolitionist movement, and now in the ultimate victory, while slavery goes on in more than 10 Muslim nations today,
[01:28:06.562 --> 01:28:08.564]  And women are slaves in hundreds of nations.
[01:28:09.044 --> 01:28:15.210]  It's okay because the greatest evil on earth is England, where we got Magna Carta and the beginning of the Renaissance.
[01:28:17.112 --> 01:28:18.193]  You're so right, Alex.
[01:28:20.135 --> 01:28:30.885]  It's just almost a sweet irony to see that the symbols of what really stand for freedom are being stood on their head
[01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:59.274]  And the institutions that really stand for individual liberty are being denigrated while everything that represents statism, control, collectivism, socialism, are being lifted up by people like the Obama administration, by all the socialists of Europe and so forth.
[01:29:01.061 --> 01:29:06.825]  Right now we are living in what I refer to as the age of deception and betrayal.
[01:29:07.685 --> 01:29:13.069]  Where our basic institutions are that anything that stands for freedom
[01:29:14.111 --> 01:29:16.593]  Is being cast in a bad light.
[01:29:16.713 --> 01:29:22.638]  We are living in the true fall of the West, and all the wealth and the cultural wealth being flushed down the toilet.
[01:29:22.958 --> 01:29:29.424]  When we come back, sir, I want to talk about what that looks like, what comes on the other side, if we don't beat it, and where you think we are in the fight against it.
[01:29:30.064 --> 01:29:31.685]  Amazing guest, James Wesley Rawls.
[01:29:31.705 --> 01:29:32.706]  We need to get him on more and more.
[01:29:32.746 --> 01:29:33.607]  He's such a busy guy.
[01:29:33.627 --> 01:29:35.889]  He usually can only come on for an hour, and that's rarely.
[01:29:36.029 --> 01:29:37.150]  He offered two hours today.
[01:29:37.170 --> 01:29:40.593]  I may just push the reporters, even though I love them and want them on.
[01:29:41.173 --> 01:29:42.273]  Uh, into the fourth hour.
[01:29:42.313 --> 01:29:53.477]  Check with Knight, see if that's good with him in the first 30 minutes because I want to really walk through all this and look at the different sectors of the globe and the master plan because knowing this plan, and this is a plan, I mean, this is public, folks.
[01:29:53.897 --> 01:29:55.518]  Knowing the plan is our chance to beat it.
[01:29:55.938 --> 01:29:57.059]  You understand how important this is?
[01:29:57.219 --> 01:29:58.119]  We're on the march.
[01:29:58.599 --> 01:30:00.200]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:03.801]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:08.067 --> 01:30:13.951]  A leaked memo reveals how the Trump campaign really feels about the establishment.
[01:30:14.232 --> 01:30:24.599]  An internal memo leaked to the Washington Post reveals the level of disdain that Trump has for the political establishment and their talking heads in the mainstream media.
[01:30:24.679 --> 01:30:36.768]  The memo, entitled, Digging Through the Bulls**t, is written by Donald Trump's senior advisor, Barry Bennett, who said the mainstream media and Washington establishment are working together like never before.
[01:30:37.068 --> 01:30:37.488]  We're good.
[01:30:55.924 --> 01:31:03.859]  Another pathetic display by the so-called experts who line their pockets at the expense of our candidates and causes.
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:06.324]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com
[01:31:07.942 --> 01:31:14.347]  Uh, yeah, Alex, first of all, I want to say, take the 12X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[01:31:14.408 --> 01:31:15.308]  I use them all.
[01:31:15.368 --> 01:31:16.309]  They're phenomenal.
[01:31:16.369 --> 01:31:17.010]  They work.
[01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:17.870]  Buy them, folks.
[01:31:17.930 --> 01:31:18.351]  Thank you, brother.
[01:31:18.371 --> 01:31:20.332]  I want to thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:31:20.352 --> 01:31:26.978]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[01:31:27.178 --> 01:31:28.519]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[01:31:28.559 --> 01:31:33.984]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[01:31:34.284 --> 01:31:35.105]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[01:31:35.125 --> 01:31:39.008]  I buy all the Nutraceuticals, AcuFX, uh, nascent iodine... Right!
[01:31:39.028 --> 01:31:39.768]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:31:39.808 --> 01:31:40.689]  Have they worked for you?
[01:31:40.829 --> 01:31:43.411]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:31:43.711 --> 01:31:44.772]  What products are you taking?
[01:31:44.792 --> 01:31:50.696]  Are you taking... Everything from, uh, Super Male to, uh, Brain Force to Winter Sun, uh, X2.
[01:31:51.077 --> 01:31:52.998]  Even got a little, uh, DNA Force.
[01:31:53.078 --> 01:31:56.601]  So, and I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofilth.
[01:31:56.701 --> 01:32:01.546]  Visit Infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[01:32:01.747 --> 01:32:03.789]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:09.014 --> 01:32:12.416]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:32:12.797 --> 01:32:19.921]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:32:20.522 --> 01:32:28.907]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:32:29.128 --> 01:32:33.250]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:32:33.571 --> 01:32:38.714]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[01:32:39.154 --> 01:32:43.097]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:32:43.377 --> 01:32:46.580]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:57.888]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:32:57.948 --> 01:33:00.610]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[01:33:00.850 --> 01:33:06.815]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[01:33:16.266 --> 01:33:23.892]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:38.866 --> 01:33:42.448]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't get up here and say all these things to have a sensational show.
[01:33:42.488 --> 01:33:44.288]  Believe me, reality is sensational.
[01:33:44.809 --> 01:33:46.849]  Reality is dangerous, it's crazy, it's real.
[01:33:48.710 --> 01:33:56.613]  And I never imagined 21 years ago, going on air, local access and local radio, I'd be here with tens of millions of people every week, conservatively.
[01:33:56.634 --> 01:33:57.974]  It's way more than that.
[01:33:58.054 --> 01:33:59.135]  It's ridiculous.
[01:33:59.735 --> 01:34:00.855]  Tuning in all over the world.
[01:34:00.895 --> 01:34:04.317]  But the good news is, the facts we're covering are what the real
[01:34:05.658 --> 01:34:07.819]  Insiders, good and bad, know what's going on.
[01:34:08.579 --> 01:34:17.101]  The elite have been so arrogant for decades, they've admitted so much of their plan so their own people could understand it, thinking you'd never go look it up.
[01:34:17.181 --> 01:34:20.702]  Well, we've been making preparations to resist, to slow this down.
[01:34:20.822 --> 01:34:24.644]  It's over 15 years behind, most experts agree, but now they're accelerating.
[01:34:24.664 --> 01:34:25.744]  We're going to talk to Mr. Rawls.
[01:34:27.102 --> 01:34:38.088]  About where this system of betrayal is going, the caliphate they're setting up, clearly the elite are allied with radical Islam, turning it loose to take over the rest of Islam, and to bring it into our countries.
[01:34:38.148 --> 01:34:38.929]  That's happening.
[01:34:39.489 --> 01:34:41.110]  That's one area I underestimated.
[01:34:41.130 --> 01:34:49.214]  It's so bold, it's so over-the-top, that I would hear people like Rawls saying this 10 years ago, and I thought, yeah, I could see that down the road, but, you know, not in 10, 20 years.
[01:34:49.254 --> 01:34:50.415]  Well, it's happening quicker.
[01:34:52.757 --> 01:34:56.259]  I gotta say that we're going to really be focusing on this a lot, obviously.
[01:34:56.439 --> 01:35:05.783]  Before I go any further, the soils, as you know, are depleted in most areas, so a lot of the food you eat, a lot of the vegetables you eat, just don't have the trace elements, all the different vitamins and minerals you need.
[01:35:06.163 --> 01:35:17.628]  We've developed, with our research, InfoWarsLife.com, an amazingly concentrated, strong system with all the minerals, all the vitamins, the amino acids, you name it.
[01:35:18.881 --> 01:35:28.167]  And this is just a super product.
[01:35:28.287 --> 01:35:33.370]  It's so good for yourself, for your children, for your husband, your wife.
[01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:35.231]  It's such a great gift to give.
[01:35:35.351 --> 01:35:40.334]  Old people, most of them have absorption problems because of all the, you know, how dead their gut is.
[01:35:40.514 --> 01:35:47.598]  Get your grandparents, get your parents on a good probiotic, get them on something like Vitamin Mineral Fusion, and
[01:35:48.894 --> 01:35:49.654]  Watch what happens.
[01:35:50.395 --> 01:35:54.417]  The amount of energy I get from this is incredible, and it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:35:55.078 --> 01:36:08.766]  It's just that it is from plant-derived, highest quality sources, and there's only a few things in here that are laboratory produced, and those are of the highest quality and of the highest standards, absolutely pure.
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:11.081]  It's an amazing product.
[01:36:11.141 --> 01:36:15.567]  Two plus years, I could have gone and gotten hundreds of products, private labeled, had them super cheap, rolled them out.
[01:36:15.687 --> 01:36:19.612]  Yeah, they'd be pretty good, but I wanted to be able to say, this is the best we could come up with.
[01:36:20.053 --> 01:36:20.954]  It's a game changer.
[01:36:21.635 --> 01:36:24.158]  This is so good, we're going to probably end up putting this in stores, you name it.
[01:36:24.919 --> 01:36:27.001]  Because, I mean, this is just over the top.
[01:36:27.762 --> 01:36:34.804]  Over the top, we use one of the biggest producers of organic, high-quality, natural supplements out there to produce this.
[01:36:34.824 --> 01:36:36.184]  We're going to be talking about that in the future.
[01:36:36.504 --> 01:36:37.725]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:36:38.205 --> 01:36:40.606]  And I have a glass at lunch every day.
[01:36:42.006 --> 01:36:45.087]  My children, I get them to drink it in the morning before they go to school.
[01:36:45.667 --> 01:36:46.547]  They absolutely love it.
[01:36:46.567 --> 01:36:47.708]  It's fruit punch flavor.
[01:36:48.008 --> 01:36:48.748]  You can sign up.
[01:36:52.332 --> 01:36:56.713]  For auto ship, cancel any time, get 10% off this order and everything else you order.
[01:36:57.193 --> 01:37:01.294]  Orders above $50 get free shipping as well at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:01.314 --> 01:37:02.254]  That's the blanket store.
[01:37:02.614 --> 01:37:05.715]  And then the subsection for the nutraceuticals, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:37:09.536 --> 01:37:12.517]  And I also promote the Longevity line because their products are excellent.
[01:37:12.537 --> 01:37:16.878]  You can find all those products and your purchase there helps fund our operation at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:37:18.553 --> 01:37:27.309]  CoreInfoWarsTeam.com, but find Vitamin Mineral Fusion, AnthroPlex, by the way, is about to sell out, Survival Shield Nation Iodine X2, Super Melon Super Female Vitality, and more.
[01:37:27.409 --> 01:37:27.650]  And look,
[01:37:29.204 --> 01:37:38.369]  All we do is go out and go to the most known for thousands of years herbs for male vitality, female vitality, concentrate them in a proprietary process and sell that.
[01:37:39.169 --> 01:37:48.473]  Or our lung cleanse is dozens and dozens and dozens of the best herbs concentrated down to oil base so that it really does help your throat when it's sore or hurting.
[01:37:49.094 --> 01:37:51.215]  Other stuff will have like two or three ingredients and some alcohol.
[01:37:51.795 --> 01:37:52.736]  This is oil, folks.
[01:37:52.756 --> 01:37:54.837]  Only problem is the sprayer gets clogged quite a bit.
[01:37:54.858 --> 01:38:00.422]  You gotta put it under hot water and wash it out a lot because it's just such an incredible essential oil.
[01:38:00.862 --> 01:38:01.843]  Check out all the products.
[01:38:01.903 --> 01:38:03.004]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:38:03.384 --> 01:38:04.505]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:38:06.006 --> 01:38:12.692]  And things are getting so serious that I myself am redoubling my efforts to have medical, basic medical equipment.
[01:38:13.894 --> 01:38:18.938]  Firearms, ammunition, going out shooting, an area in the country that's safer to get to.
[01:38:19.418 --> 01:38:22.020]  I hope it doesn't get to that, but the depression's here.
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:22.960]  It's going to get worse.
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:24.401]  Society's already unraveling.
[01:38:24.802 --> 01:38:26.303]  The police state isn't going to save us.
[01:38:26.323 --> 01:38:30.025]  We're going to talk about preparedness with Mr. Rawls as well coming up.
[01:38:30.065 --> 01:38:31.446]  Survivalblog.com.
[01:38:32.607 --> 01:38:33.988]  Again, formerly with Army Intelligence.
[01:38:34.008 --> 01:38:37.571]  And of course, nobody in the Army ever brags about the stuff they did, but I ran into a colonel.
[01:38:38.885 --> 01:38:39.105]  I don't
[01:38:56.701 --> 01:39:01.345]  I was out at the courthouse taking care of something, and he was saying, oh, you know, Rawls used to work for me, he's a great guy.
[01:39:01.565 --> 01:39:08.651]  So I had three different people who tuned into the show, just talking about the great stuff Mr. Rawls has done for America, which we'll never hear about.
[01:39:08.671 --> 01:39:10.332]  You know, the quiet professionals.
[01:39:10.352 --> 01:39:13.014]  But he just really knows what he's talking about, and we love having him on.
[01:39:13.034 --> 01:39:17.438]  I want to get into the Caliphate, your latest novel, which is a smart way to educate people, obviously.
[01:39:17.798 --> 01:39:23.102]  They seem to listen to stuff that's fiction, even though it's real, versus stuff that's real, they seem to ignore it.
[01:39:23.603 --> 01:39:24.964]  But we'll talk about that as well.
[01:39:26.445 --> 01:39:29.853]  Survival, the economy, where you think Obama's going, the rest of it.
[01:39:29.873 --> 01:39:33.641]  But as we went to break, Mr. Rawls, you brought up...
[01:39:35.199 --> 01:39:39.960]  The situation with the age of deception, the age of betrayal.
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:42.641]  Is this the beginning of the fall?
[01:39:43.781 --> 01:39:45.341]  Why are they so naked now?
[01:39:45.461 --> 01:39:46.981]  What do you think of Donald Trump?
[01:39:47.862 --> 01:39:49.242]  Why are they so scared of him?
[01:39:49.282 --> 01:39:51.022]  Because quite frankly, I didn't trust him a year ago.
[01:39:51.042 --> 01:39:55.783]  He's involved in casinos and things, and I'm not into really being super flashy.
[01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:56.764]  It kind of turns me off.
[01:39:57.484 --> 01:39:58.364]  But at the same time,
[01:39:59.484 --> 01:40:01.345]  He was against NAFTA and GATT 20 years ago.
[01:40:01.406 --> 01:40:02.306]  He is a nationalist.
[01:40:02.386 --> 01:40:08.170]  I know people that know him before he ever ran for office that said, oh, you didn't know Donald Trump's anti-New World Order?
[01:40:08.830 --> 01:40:14.034]  And so all this clicked for me about six, seven months ago that they're scared of him for some reason.
[01:40:15.015 --> 01:40:16.656]  This couldn't be a foil.
[01:40:16.676 --> 01:40:18.197]  This couldn't be a double cross, could it?
[01:40:18.897 --> 01:40:20.638]  But I want your real view on that as well.
[01:40:20.658 --> 01:40:29.024]  But let's get into the age of betrayal, the age of deception, where you think the world is right now, and then into this election and into the caliphate.
[01:40:30.945 --> 01:40:39.810]  Well, Alex, I think that Donald Trump, I think, is popular because he represents, at least, an outsider to the political system.
[01:40:40.591 --> 01:40:48.756]  And people are definitely fed up with insider after insider after insider being offered up as candidates.
[01:40:49.336 --> 01:40:58.602]  And while I don't think Donald Trump is a perfect candidate, I think that he at least resonates with a lot of people as representing
[01:41:00.583 --> 01:41:13.835]  Old school American nationalism, national sovereignty, and as a counterbalance to the forces of international banking.
[01:41:14.316 --> 01:41:22.823]  Now, unfortunately, he has some compromises in his background that make him kind of suspect.
[01:41:23.652 --> 01:41:32.399]  Because of actually connections to the Clintons of all people and his many business connections with the bankers.
[01:41:32.899 --> 01:41:37.523]  So I find it really difficult to believe that he's a true outsider.
[01:41:38.516 --> 01:41:48.666]  But he certainly represents more of an outsider than certainly than Hillary or Sanders, for example.
[01:41:48.706 --> 01:41:49.487]  Let me ask you this then.
[01:41:49.507 --> 01:42:03.180]  The all-hands-on-deck scenario, and I agree with what you just said, the all-hands-deck scenario from the Communist Chinese government, the Mexican government, the former president, the British government, the Pope, to you name it, every magazine, every newspaper coming out against him,
[01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:09.701]  I see real hysteria and real hate and real concern and the big billionaires getting together and giving hundreds of millions to beat him.
[01:42:10.581 --> 01:42:28.685]  I see that as them legitimately hitting the panic button because they see the nationalism he's saying, even if he's not really a good guy, is irrevocable damage to them, but it also shows how arrogant they are to think we can have all these foreign governments lecture us how deep into globalist colonialism we really are.
[01:42:30.483 --> 01:42:42.830]  Yeah, the amount of vitriol that's being directed against him is evidence that the powers that be are feeling very nervous, very anxious.
[01:42:42.850 --> 01:42:44.231]  They're losing control.
[01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:59.017]  of the political process because for years and years we've had political party A versus political party B and lo and behold the candidates for both of those parties have been insiders.
[01:42:59.057 --> 01:43:06.280]  They've all been CFR or trilateral commission related individuals.
[01:43:07.761 --> 01:43:13.124]  Every time we've been given a so-called choice on the ballot that really isn't a choice.
[01:43:13.224 --> 01:43:13.544]  It's either
[01:43:14.599 --> 01:43:30.068]  Political Insider A or Political Insider B. And for them to see Trump on the horizon is truly, truly frightening to them to see anything outside of their stage-managed operation.
[01:43:30.088 --> 01:43:34.190]  So we're seeing a de facto response to populism, whether he be real or not.
[01:43:34.531 --> 01:43:38.553]  It's kind of like, you know, putting up a fake owl to scare away crows.
[01:43:38.813 --> 01:43:40.314]  They just see an owl and are upset.
[01:43:40.334 --> 01:43:41.354]  They don't know if it's real or not.
[01:43:41.615 --> 01:43:43.756]  They're trying to figure out if it's real, but it scares them.
[01:43:44.841 --> 01:43:46.701]  Yes, that's essentially it.
[01:43:48.802 --> 01:44:05.526]  The folks that want to control the whole game, really, they want to control us economically, politically, in every sphere, basically, look at people like Donald Trump as wild cards.
[01:44:06.406 --> 01:44:12.127]  And because he's outside of their control, and he is unpredictable,
[01:44:15.541 --> 01:44:18.084]  It really throws a monkey wrench into their plans.
[01:44:18.104 --> 01:44:20.147]  Do you think he realizes how much danger he's in?
[01:44:21.749 --> 01:44:22.730]  Probably not.
[01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:27.836]  Anyone who goes up against Hillary Clinton ought to be really, really worried.
[01:44:30.031 --> 01:44:38.754]  His chances of making it at body temperature to the election, I would say, are actually fairly small.
[01:44:39.814 --> 01:44:50.697]  I would not be surprised to see that he mysteriously dies of an aneurysm or a heart attack or, you know, something, anything.
[01:44:51.077 --> 01:44:52.618]  But his
[01:44:53.997 --> 01:44:56.638]  The chances of him making it to the election, I think, are small.
[01:44:57.559 --> 01:45:00.360]  If he truly is the threat that they think he is.
[01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:14.326]  Have you ever, in your decades of being politically involved, 30 years or so since you got out of the army, have you ever, Mr. Rawls, James Wesley Rawls from survivalblog.com, joining us from the top, most respected survivalist and global security experts out there,
[01:45:15.265 --> 01:45:17.327]  I mean, not just with the general public, but with the Pentagon, you name it.
[01:45:17.347 --> 01:45:18.588]  Everybody really respects him, and I know.
[01:45:19.049 --> 01:45:22.412]  Have you ever seen a more dangerous time, not just for America, but the world?
[01:45:22.472 --> 01:45:25.415]  I mean, this is just, for me, looking at this, this is unprecedented.
[01:45:25.735 --> 01:45:33.262]  The amount of dominoes lined up, the amount of triggers being thrown, the elite scurrying around building armored redoubts.
[01:45:33.322 --> 01:45:37.226]  I mean, government all over the world is acting like something big is coming.
[01:45:38.348 --> 01:45:47.533]  It's truly unprecedented, because if you look at the mountain of debt and the scale of the derivatives that have built up, that's one huge threat.
[01:45:47.933 --> 01:45:54.377]  And meanwhile, geopolitically, we see a regional war in Syria that could very well blow up into World War III.
[01:45:54.857 --> 01:46:01.061]  And we see tension in the South China Sea, which could very well blow up into another world war.
[01:46:01.721 --> 01:46:04.042]  We are truly in uncharted waters here.
[01:46:04.282 --> 01:46:06.844]  We have a situation that
[01:46:08.223 --> 01:46:22.227]  Where the global economy is teetering on the brink, we have the central banks are right now in the process of going to sub-zero interest rates, which is an absolute panic move.
[01:46:22.827 --> 01:46:26.408]  They have basically run out of ammunition in the economic war.
[01:46:26.428 --> 01:46:28.489]  That's like injecting adrenaline directly into the heart.
[01:46:33.433 --> 01:46:47.199]  At this point, we are teetering on the brink of either economic collapse or global war as kind of the final option for the insiders to have their way.
[01:46:47.739 --> 01:46:52.041]  Because without either of those, we're just simply going to see the truth come out.
[01:46:52.461 --> 01:46:56.743]  What's happened with the Panama Papers, I think, is just one little glimpse
[01:46:58.044 --> 01:47:06.166]  Of the extent of the international financial web that exists.
[01:47:06.587 --> 01:47:11.708]  Well, from what I've seen, it looks like it's a Western attempt to just go after Putin, and certainly Putin's involved in a bunch of this stuff.
[01:47:12.048 --> 01:47:15.109]  But it seems selective to some mid-level networks.
[01:47:15.289 --> 01:47:16.470]  Highly selective, yes.
[01:47:17.170 --> 01:47:19.550]  And if you'll notice, they're mainly pointing the finger at
[01:47:21.716 --> 01:47:36.164]  Uh, African dictators, for example, with these, um, these trust arrangements with, you know, bearer number one or bearer number two, for example, um, as the beneficiaries.
[01:47:37.585 --> 01:47:43.188]  The serious money, the big money, is being traded in the hot markets every day.
[01:47:43.208 --> 01:47:45.310]  It's not these tiny little
[01:47:46.010 --> 01:47:48.293]  You know, I say relatively tiny.
[01:47:48.553 --> 01:48:06.893]  These billion-dollar trusts that are being set up to benefit the children of Middle Eastern and African dictators are small change compared to the trillions of dollars that are flowing internationally
[01:48:07.634 --> 01:48:11.076]  The manipulation that's going on in the currency markets.
[01:48:11.416 --> 01:48:13.458]  You mentioned earlier credit default swaps.
[01:48:13.678 --> 01:48:18.921]  People have no idea about the scope of the derivatives trading that goes on.
[01:48:19.501 --> 01:48:23.404]  A CDS, a credit default swap, is a form of derivative.
[01:48:24.424 --> 01:48:37.012]  And it's so well refined as a derivative that a movement as small as one-tenth of one percent of an interest rate
[01:48:38.359 --> 01:48:40.839]  Can put a major shockwave through the system.
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:55.662]  And unfortunately, the way this derivatives casino has built up, it's so finely tuned that when a big swing does happen, where interest rates move a whole percentage point or two percentage points, it's going to absolutely collapse the system.
[01:48:55.682 --> 01:48:57.342]  Well, James, I want to talk triggers with you.
[01:48:57.362 --> 01:48:58.403]  I want to get into Caliphate.
[01:48:58.423 --> 01:48:59.343]  And I just want to go ahead.
[01:48:59.363 --> 01:49:00.743]  I'm going to have you through the whole next hour.
[01:49:00.763 --> 01:49:03.243]  We're going to have reporters on in the fourth hour with David Knight.
[01:49:03.263 --> 01:49:04.744]  He has another guest popping in as well.
[01:49:04.784 --> 01:49:06.304]  But looking at this,
[01:49:08.322 --> 01:49:12.563]  Here's a Telegraph article, China jitters could trigger global market bloodbath, IMF warns.
[01:49:12.843 --> 01:49:23.547]  I love how the very progenitors of this whole scam warn us, and the former head of the Fed that helped give us the derivatives with Clinton, Greenspan, warns us of irrational exuberance.
[01:49:23.587 --> 01:49:31.549]  It's like selling a kid a bag full of crack and giving him a pipe and saying, look out, this might be addicting, but it's just amazing.
[01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:37.111]  But getting back to things I see as problems that nobody talks about it, and I'm not bragging when I say
[01:49:38.248 --> 01:49:47.441]  One thing that launched our show, unbeknownst to me, like 19 years ago, is I put out some police state films showing the military training for gun confiscation and things domestically.
[01:49:48.282 --> 01:49:52.668]  And then the Army and Marines said, don't watch Alex Jones' videos and don't go to his website.
[01:49:53.749 --> 01:49:56.191]  Man, I suddenly had this huge audience of the military tune in.
[01:49:56.712 --> 01:49:58.253]  What was the establishment thinking?
[01:49:58.273 --> 01:50:01.896]  Because my audience probably quadrupled overnight when they started doing that.
[01:50:02.257 --> 01:50:05.139]  That actually launched us was them saying, don't go here.
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:08.062]  So they seem like they're smart, but they also seem like they're dumb.
[01:50:08.422 --> 01:50:09.663]  Now, I was totally unpolished.
[01:50:09.683 --> 01:50:12.246]  Them still aren't, but knew more than the average person.
[01:50:12.506 --> 01:50:13.707]  So the show got very popular.
[01:50:13.807 --> 01:50:19.012]  I became a source because then all these people started giving me stuff because nobody else would talk about it.
[01:50:20.049 --> 01:50:31.997]  Here we are, 20 years later, and the military listens to the show, foreign governments listen to it, they listen to others like it, but it shows how bad the rest of the media is, is that we're some of the, you know, best that's out there, I'm not bragging.
[01:50:32.497 --> 01:50:41.062]  But to know that most of the military is aware of what's going on, says they're not going to go along with the globalist takeover, that's got to really cause a problem.
[01:50:41.102 --> 01:50:46.326]  And I'm not saying I'm behind this, I'm one small part of it, but I'm a gauge because I interface with these people.
[01:50:47.066 --> 01:50:49.488]  On the street, you name it, so I know how awake they are.
[01:50:50.068 --> 01:50:57.773]  Does the establishment realize that they still currently say don't go to mfulwars.com and don't go to your site and a bunch of others, as you know.
[01:50:58.293 --> 01:51:02.396]  Don't they understand that's backfiring with the Streisand effect squared?
[01:51:02.676 --> 01:51:05.258]  We'll be back with James Wesley Rawls, survivalblog.com.
[01:51:05.498 --> 01:51:06.699]  I'm Alex Jones with the answer.

[01:54:14.684 --> 01:54:16.925]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:21.727 --> 01:54:34.852]  Okay, we're going to get back to that point that Mr. Rawls got cut off on as we went to break, where I was asking the question about the military.
[01:54:36.119 --> 01:54:38.601]  And I'm not branding them as the heroes or anything.
[01:54:38.641 --> 01:54:40.842]  These are people that have actually been in the real world on average.
[01:54:41.163 --> 01:54:42.203]  They know about the corruption.
[01:54:42.223 --> 01:54:43.044]  They know about the system.
[01:54:43.804 --> 01:54:47.847]  And that's always been the problem of dictators or oligarchies, is the security services turning against them.
[01:54:48.688 --> 01:54:50.229]  Now look at Operation Valkyrie and Hitler.
[01:54:51.089 --> 01:54:52.410]  The problem is this is an oligarchy.
[01:54:52.450 --> 01:54:53.231]  It's a whole bunch of people.
[01:54:53.271 --> 01:54:54.071]  It's not one guy.
[01:54:54.091 --> 01:54:56.493]  So we're going to talk about that briefly, start the next hour.
[01:54:56.513 --> 01:54:57.234]  But here's an example.
[01:54:57.794 --> 01:54:58.795]  I get up Saturday.
[01:54:58.815 --> 01:55:04.839]  I see a headline, Muslim woman run over by right-wing nationalist in Molenbeek.
[01:55:06.107 --> 01:55:10.170]  And I read the article from the Daily Mail, and it never says who they are or they've been caught.
[01:55:10.190 --> 01:55:12.432]  I go, that doesn't sound right.
[01:55:12.492 --> 01:55:15.915]  That sounds like a false flag, because the radical Muslims are experts at this.
[01:55:16.315 --> 01:55:19.198]  She runs out, and it looks staged, and jumps in front of the car.
[01:55:22.481 --> 01:55:25.263]  Just like they, you know, staged the dead baby on the beach in Greece and all that.
[01:55:26.345 --> 01:55:29.348]  I go to the comments, everybody's mad thinking we're the ones saying this.
[01:55:29.368 --> 01:55:31.950]  Well, go to our, go to our InfoWars and I'll show you.
[01:55:32.350 --> 01:55:36.694]  Horrific moment, Muslim woman is mowed down by grinning driver who then stops to take picture.
[01:55:37.414 --> 01:55:40.557]  Oh, they changed the headline, look, when this came out, ah!
[01:55:41.057 --> 01:55:47.823]  Now, Breitbart, Molonbeek, far right, hit and run was Muslim on Muslim attack.
[01:55:53.504 --> 01:56:04.333]  A local drunk youth named Mohammed, hit and run by a Muslim woman in Mozambique this week, blamed on far-right anti-Islam demonstrators, was in fact perpetrated by an allegedly drunk local youth named Mohammed.
[01:56:04.934 --> 01:56:12.100]  So, I don't mean to just divert off, but it's this constant lying, and then saying German men raped the women in Cologne and all this.
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:14.081]  They're almost all military-age men.
[01:56:14.121 --> 01:56:15.122]  They invaded Syria.
[01:56:15.142 --> 01:56:15.783]  They're coming in.
[01:56:17.304 --> 01:56:20.925]  Now Europe's bringing him, and we're going to talk about that at the start of the next hour with Mr. Rawls.
[01:56:20.945 --> 01:56:31.087]  But the time we have, sir, in this short segment, getting back to you in the next four minutes, specifically with my military question, what are they thinking when they say, don't visit patriot sides?
[01:56:31.527 --> 01:56:34.068]  Don't, you know, George Washington's bad.
[01:56:34.088 --> 01:56:35.248]  The founding fathers are bad.
[01:56:35.368 --> 01:56:37.648]  They actually, as you know, teach the military that.
[01:56:37.908 --> 01:56:39.469]  That's actually woken the military up.
[01:56:39.749 --> 01:56:40.729]  What are the globalists thinking?
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:47.025]  Well, they're hoping that they can control the military, but the problem is...
[01:56:48.884 --> 01:57:03.033]  Even with a dumbed-down electorate, a dumbed-down populace that's reaching military age, even with that, people still have basic common sense and they can see what's going on in the world around them.
[01:57:03.754 --> 01:57:04.654]  They get curious.
[01:57:05.255 --> 01:57:06.856]  They now turn to the Internet.
[01:57:06.876 --> 01:57:13.400]  It used to be newsletters and magazines and that sort of thing, but they turn to the Internet to seek the truth and
[01:57:15.066 --> 01:57:28.691]  They're hoping that they can control access to that knowledge, to keep that knowledge out of the hands of the people that they want to have as their foot soldiers.
[01:57:29.772 --> 01:57:30.552]  It's not working.
[01:57:31.112 --> 01:57:42.377]  They tried firewalling more than a thousand patriot websites at the Pentagon two years ago, and there was a quiet rebellion that went on.
[01:57:43.522 --> 01:58:02.332]  Where first people were saying, well, you can't firewall us, or if you firewall us, only firewall us during working hours, but we want to have unlimited internet access before working hours, on our lunch hour, and after work.
[01:58:02.352 --> 01:58:06.414]  And the IT staff at the Pentagon backed down.
[01:58:06.754 --> 01:58:07.915]  They actually relented.
[01:58:08.803 --> 01:58:14.725]  Because there were so many people at the Pentagon that were upset about this.
[01:58:14.745 --> 01:58:15.765]  And that's what I'm getting at.
[01:58:15.925 --> 01:58:21.507]  Don't they understand that when they tried to blacklist you and myself and others, that just made everybody come check out what we're saying?
[01:58:21.747 --> 01:58:24.648]  They hear we're telling the truth and it backfired, didn't it?
[01:58:25.408 --> 01:58:38.012]  But what happened was people were using VPN, virtual private networks, or web surfing from at home, or web surfing from wireless networks,
[01:58:38.792 --> 01:58:44.315]  Literally, from their mobile devices in the parking lot of the Pentagon.
[01:58:44.335 --> 01:58:45.255]  This is so exciting.
[01:58:45.315 --> 01:58:45.695]  Stay there.
[01:58:45.955 --> 01:58:46.416]  Back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:46.436 --> 01:58:47.996]  This is a microcosm of everything.
[01:58:48.997 --> 01:58:50.157]  They're not invincible folks.
[01:58:50.177 --> 01:58:53.159]  The globalists can be defeated if you realize you have the power.
[01:58:53.999 --> 01:58:54.799]  You are the resistance.
[01:58:54.859 --> 01:58:55.099]  Back in 70.
[01:58:55.500 --> 01:58:55.880]  Stay with us.
[01:58:57.728 --> 01:59:00.930]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:09.275]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:59:09.495 --> 01:59:14.518]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:59:14.898 --> 01:59:17.200]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:19.221]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:00:00.283 --> 02:00:02.914]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:24.513]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:25.054 --> 02:00:31.262]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:31.502 --> 02:00:36.790]  Alright, coming up...
[02:00:37.884 --> 02:00:44.048]  At about 24 after, we're going to start opening the phones up for the balance of the hour for James Wesley Rawls, our guest.
[02:00:44.088 --> 02:00:47.391]  Also want to hit a bunch of other news items with him and get his take on it.
[02:00:47.611 --> 02:00:48.811]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:00:52.875 --> 02:00:52.935]  800-259-9231.
[02:00:53.035 --> 02:00:55.576]  That was a short segment.
[02:00:55.616 --> 02:00:56.597]  This is a short segment.
[02:00:56.657 --> 02:01:08.382]  In the long segment, we're going to get into the Caliphate, his latest novel, and what the next big shoe to drop in his brain is with the man that heads up survivalblog.com, James Wesley Rawls.
[02:01:08.722 --> 02:01:12.224]  I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:01:13.604 --> 02:01:16.626]  But getting back to what you were just saying, to me this is key because
[02:01:17.797 --> 02:01:20.138]  I used to get mad at police and some of the police state stuff.
[02:01:20.158 --> 02:01:23.318]  I realize that's what they're being trained to do is we should change it above them.
[02:01:23.678 --> 02:01:24.718]  That's our political job.
[02:01:25.279 --> 02:01:28.739]  But on average, cops tend to be more awake to the general public.
[02:01:29.559 --> 02:01:35.181]  And some jurisdictions are very corrupt, but others are pretty good folks overall.
[02:01:36.141 --> 02:01:40.822]  And so that's why you've got the Black Lives Matter, the UN Strong Cities Initiative coming in to take over.
[02:01:40.842 --> 02:01:41.702]  I mean, it's actually happening.
[02:01:44.355 --> 02:01:46.816]  And so we also have the military even more awake.
[02:01:46.876 --> 02:01:50.738]  So they're saying the number one domestic enemy will be returning veterans and gun owners.
[02:01:51.078 --> 02:01:56.920]  Well, that woke up military training to take on domestic terrorists who they're being taught are themselves.
[02:01:57.601 --> 02:01:59.481]  So there's a major disconnect to the elites.
[02:01:59.541 --> 02:02:03.163]  And if they would have disconnects, like not realizing when you tell
[02:02:05.003 --> 02:02:10.845]  Marines and Army troops on bases across the country don't go to InfoWars.com, but they're all going to go to InfoWars.com.
[02:02:11.025 --> 02:02:21.510]  Or, when they get up there and bad-mount the founders and Christians and gun owners and make the men wear red high-heeled shoes, that it's not demoralizing them, it's turning them against their controllers.
[02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:24.251]  You take a bunch of socialist engineers, give them
[02:02:24.911 --> 02:02:29.192]  ROTC merit, give them an officer's commission, stick them in the military.
[02:02:29.432 --> 02:02:31.873]  It's so alien, they've caused a total wake-up.
[02:02:31.973 --> 02:02:34.594]  I mean, I really see this as one of the biggest missteps ever.
[02:02:34.634 --> 02:02:36.335]  Go ahead, sir, and give me your view on that.
[02:02:36.355 --> 02:02:44.897]  We are in a situation where the controllers are losing control.
[02:02:46.357 --> 02:02:50.779]  Because there's so many different channels of media now available,
[02:02:51.670 --> 02:02:53.714]  They basically can't stop the signal.
[02:02:54.515 --> 02:02:55.878]  The truth is out there.
[02:02:56.299 --> 02:03:01.408]  It's people like you and bloggers and podcasters.
[02:03:02.871 --> 02:03:09.036]  And journalists, non-mainstream journalists, who are waking people up to the truth.
[02:03:09.836 --> 02:03:12.799]  And a lot of those people are in military organizations.
[02:03:13.659 --> 02:03:19.003]  They're people, as I mentioned before, at the Pentagon, for example.
[02:03:20.264 --> 02:03:22.966]  People who are on general staffs.
[02:03:23.527 --> 02:03:25.849]  People who are in military intelligence.
[02:03:26.109 --> 02:03:27.370]  And most people don't realize that
[02:03:28.274 --> 02:03:39.341]  There's as many people in military intelligence with the different military services as there are with the CIA and the NSA and the NRO, for example.
[02:03:59.074 --> 02:04:03.276]  Mutiny, but it's not mutiny because the military realizes the country's now been captured.
[02:04:04.156 --> 02:04:04.356]  Right.
[02:04:05.436 --> 02:04:14.139]  There's definitely different competing camps within the intelligence agencies and within the military.
[02:04:14.439 --> 02:04:21.622]  A lot of the really conservative, libertarian and, you know, freedom-minded
[02:04:23.104 --> 02:04:30.268]  General officers were purged during the seven years of the Obama administration.
[02:04:31.269 --> 02:04:44.097]  But there's still a lot of people in the enlisted ranks, warrant officers, junior officers, and up into the field grade officers who have a concept of American liberty.
[02:04:44.537 --> 02:04:46.718]  And they cannot quench that.
[02:04:46.778 --> 02:04:47.338]  They can't just
[02:04:49.443 --> 02:04:51.324]  They just can't put that fire out.
[02:04:51.344 --> 02:04:52.164]  This is the key to everything.
[02:04:52.204 --> 02:04:52.544]  Stay there.
[02:04:52.584 --> 02:04:54.365]  I want you to come back and speak to this at length.
[02:04:54.385 --> 02:04:55.305]  Then get into the Caliphate.
[02:04:55.545 --> 02:04:56.566]  Survivalblog.com.
[02:04:56.606 --> 02:04:57.246]  This is the key.
[02:04:58.126 --> 02:05:04.548]  They've already decapitated the federal government and brought in their operatives, but the people that actually run the military are still there and they're awake now.
[02:05:04.568 --> 02:05:05.729]  This is a key time.
[02:05:07.893 --> 02:05:13.754]  A leaked memo reveals how the Trump campaign really feels about the establishment.
[02:05:14.035 --> 02:05:24.417]  An internal memo leaked to the Washington Post reveals the level of disdain that Trump has for the political establishment and their talking heads in the mainstream media.
[02:05:24.477 --> 02:05:36.580]  The memo, entitled, Digging Through the Bulls**t, is written by Donald Trump's senior advisor, Barry Bennett, who said the mainstream media and Washington establishment are working together like never before.
[02:05:36.860 --> 02:05:37.300]  We're good.
[02:05:55.715 --> 02:06:03.661]  Another pathetic display by the so-called experts who line their pockets at the expense of our candidates and causes.
[02:06:04.061 --> 02:06:07.024]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:07.664 --> 02:06:18.012]  You're investing in your health and supporting the InfoWar when you visit InfoWarsLive.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 Nacin Iodine and all the great products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:06:18.192 --> 02:06:19.633]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists.
[02:06:19.793 --> 02:06:23.877]  Chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[02:06:24.097 --> 02:06:31.203]  Iodine is key, is paramount, and there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[02:06:31.323 --> 02:06:40.071]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drilled down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[02:06:40.271 --> 02:06:40.932]  On top of that,
[02:06:41.052 --> 02:06:43.973]  We also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[02:06:44.173 --> 02:06:46.854]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[02:06:46.994 --> 02:06:59.698]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of Survival Shield nascent iodine, that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[02:06:59.918 --> 02:07:06.861]  It is exclusive to Infowarslife.com and the Infowarslife family of incredible products.
[02:07:07.541 --> 02:07:11.262]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:07:11.502 --> 02:07:17.623]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:07:17.823 --> 02:07:24.805]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[02:07:25.105 --> 02:07:33.907]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[02:07:34.207 --> 02:07:40.128]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:07:40.368 --> 02:07:44.869]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:07:45.209 --> 02:07:48.549]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:07:48.789 --> 02:07:50.430]  No needles, no injections.
[02:07:50.690 --> 02:07:52.210]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:07:52.330 --> 02:07:53.370]  Try it for yourself.
[02:07:53.530 --> 02:07:55.091]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.
[02:07:55.851 --> 02:08:00.992]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:03.852 --> 02:08:05.893]  Infowars Life Secret 12.
[02:08:18.076 --> 02:08:23.218]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:23.718 --> 02:08:26.179]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.804 --> 02:08:39.690]  About 160 years ago, 165 years ago, the British crown was having trouble expanding and maintaining its empire.
[02:08:40.130 --> 02:08:56.983]  So they financed their top scientists, this is all in books that have been published at the time and since then, to come up with social engineering and social control, and to develop machines that could track and trace everyone, and to develop cultural systems of what they called mind war.
[02:08:58.715 --> 02:09:01.816]  That was actually a British term, and then it was picked up by the Germans.
[02:09:01.836 --> 02:09:04.516]  It's what they called PSYOPS, or psychological warfare.
[02:09:07.456 --> 02:09:11.497]  But what happens when people in the endgame realize that they're the target of it as well?
[02:09:12.417 --> 02:09:14.918]  You see, globalism isn't just taken over because it's a better system.
[02:09:17.098 --> 02:09:18.458]  That would just take over by adoption.
[02:09:19.098 --> 02:09:19.579]  Free market.
[02:09:20.339 --> 02:09:22.299]  It's taking over to end all competition.
[02:09:22.479 --> 02:09:26.180]  It's taking over to end the family, to end our culture as you know it.
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:27.960]  Go read the book, Things to Come.
[02:09:31.914 --> 02:09:34.436]  Go see what the head of the Fabian Socialists said they were going to do.
[02:09:34.656 --> 02:09:37.277]  He wrote more non-fiction books than he wrote fiction.
[02:09:38.558 --> 02:09:41.660]  I've probably read seven or eight non-fiction books by H.G.
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:44.322]  Wells, and I'll be honest, I can't read any more of them.
[02:09:44.442 --> 02:09:47.904]  I used to read all their books and stuff, and Carol Quigley, and I already know their plan.
[02:09:48.264 --> 02:09:53.288]  It's really scary to actually read them saying it, and licking their lips and stuff.
[02:09:54.383 --> 02:09:56.844]  Folks, these people really don't like you, okay?
[02:09:57.664 --> 02:10:06.326]  And you need to understand, they're the same people that used the people of Ireland and Scotland and England who were strong to build their world tyranny.
[02:10:09.087 --> 02:10:14.768]  They were colonialized by the Romanian and Habsburg, who weren't even really German,
[02:10:16.587 --> 02:10:23.053]  Criminals that had learned how to control the final spice trade coming in out of the Middle East, there in what's Transylvania today.
[02:10:23.073 --> 02:10:27.297]  And they perfected torture and political manipulation and really a lot of bad stuff.
[02:10:27.617 --> 02:10:33.242]  Not that Western Europe was perfect, but they brought all that in, they took over, and God help us, man.
[02:10:35.104 --> 02:10:41.270]  And notice, now the West gets the blame for what these people have used us to build for them.
[02:10:42.466 --> 02:10:43.927]  And they're now moving into their endgame.
[02:10:44.627 --> 02:10:47.429]  So your terms like communist, fascist, socialist, those are all to confuse you.
[02:10:47.609 --> 02:10:53.253]  They're different forms of command and control that the elites want because they can manage command and control because it's centralized.
[02:10:53.573 --> 02:10:54.534]  Read Tragedy and Hope.
[02:10:54.594 --> 02:10:55.314]  We sell the book.
[02:10:56.195 --> 02:11:03.720]  Infowarsstore.com, back in print, written by this guy that published it so the State Department's own people could understand what they're doing.
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:06.221]  What, we fund communists and fascists and socialists?
[02:11:06.482 --> 02:11:07.462]  And we want dictators?
[02:11:07.502 --> 02:11:08.203]  We don't want freedom?
[02:11:09.591 --> 02:11:14.615]  And it's an 1100 page book explaining to them that none of this means anything, that we're taking over.
[02:11:15.255 --> 02:11:16.656]  And that we're the new British Empire.
[02:11:16.896 --> 02:11:18.878]  And that we know best, so just do it.
[02:11:19.819 --> 02:11:20.819]  And you'll be taken care of.
[02:11:23.621 --> 02:11:25.243]  They're so arrogant, they published it.
[02:11:25.963 --> 02:11:28.325]  People actually started reading it though, so they took it out of print.
[02:11:28.665 --> 02:11:29.666]  That's where this goes.
[02:11:30.046 --> 02:11:34.049]  James Wesley Rowles and I are not up here giving you our opinion.
[02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:35.050]  Do you understand that?
[02:11:36.428 --> 02:11:40.331]  The thousands of quotes, the statements, the admissions, it's far worse than I can tell you.
[02:11:40.731 --> 02:11:47.856]  Prince Philip, Prince Charles, constantly talking about how they want to kill everybody and bring in world government to forcibly inoculate you, you know, cancer, viruses.
[02:11:48.236 --> 02:11:49.537]  They mean business.
[02:11:52.939 --> 02:11:53.620]  They mean business.
[02:11:55.021 --> 02:11:57.763]  And the fact that some whacked out Transylvanian royalty
[02:11:59.813 --> 02:12:08.122]  Once a world government to run your life, and they're always, you know what, they're always digging up on the castle properties and the rest of it, little kids.
[02:12:08.182 --> 02:12:11.105]  I mean, folks, you cannot make up how evil these people are.
[02:12:11.125 --> 02:12:12.166]  I'm going to stop right there.
[02:12:12.607 --> 02:12:13.888]  But again, it's legends.
[02:12:13.968 --> 02:12:15.570]  They're not physical vampires.
[02:12:16.513 --> 02:12:18.094]  They're a bloodline of psychotics.
[02:12:19.155 --> 02:12:20.355]  And they're not even running the show.
[02:12:21.096 --> 02:12:23.657]  They just kicked off and funded science.
[02:12:23.697 --> 02:12:26.219]  You know, there was major science in the 1850s, folks.
[02:12:26.679 --> 02:12:28.200]  They focused on the science of control.
[02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:29.400]  And this has been copied.
[02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:30.201]  It's been exported.
[02:12:30.481 --> 02:12:31.401]  It's been refined.
[02:12:31.421 --> 02:12:32.422]  There's all these new systems.
[02:12:32.502 --> 02:12:32.982]  I'm ranting.
[02:12:33.222 --> 02:12:34.143]  I'm gonna go back to our guest.
[02:12:34.583 --> 02:12:35.924]  You should understand what we face.
[02:12:36.184 --> 02:12:37.285]  The terms you want to know
[02:12:38.655 --> 02:12:50.865]  Is the fact that globalism is really totally corrupt scientific colonialism by multinational mega banks and institutions that are above the law and are the new royalty.
[02:12:52.266 --> 02:12:54.148]  With the power to tax but are exempt from it.
[02:12:54.528 --> 02:12:56.289]  Letter of Mark given to their operatives.
[02:12:56.489 --> 02:12:57.230]  They're mercenaries.
[02:12:59.052 --> 02:13:04.276]  And they're reversing the Western invasion where they'd say you're going to be put on a ship or we're going to kill you.
[02:13:06.055 --> 02:13:15.500]  I mean, you think it was fun when, you know, like the 1600s, more than half of crews died routinely, usually about a third, on an African or South American voyage?
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:16.461]  You think they weren't slaves?
[02:13:19.402 --> 02:13:21.243]  And the West then tried to end slavery.
[02:13:21.663 --> 02:13:24.025]  But within the West was growing this great evil.
[02:13:25.305 --> 02:13:31.529]  And so now you're facing scientific colonialism
[02:13:33.260 --> 02:13:46.577]  At a multinational, above the state level, playing the states off against each other, the individuals against each other, the great game times a thousand, and nested in the heart of this, nested in the core of this.
[02:13:48.404 --> 02:14:05.614]  He is then using the giant third world populations with promises of their own colonialism to come to the West and get the free welfare and the free goodies to be brought here to be programmed with liberation theology, hate the West theology, and then you conquer the third world and the West by playing them off against each other.
[02:14:06.539 --> 02:14:08.340]  And that is their admitted plan.
[02:14:08.620 --> 02:14:10.281]  You have been given the enemy's blueprint.
[02:14:10.561 --> 02:14:11.342]  What are you going to do about it?
[02:14:11.382 --> 02:14:14.924]  Now, Mr. Rawls, I'm going to try to shut up and give you the floor now, but I want to set the table here.
[02:14:15.544 --> 02:14:28.271]  Getting back into the military waking up, the bureaucrats waking up, a lot of people understanding now as we near the endgame that the patriots were right the last 60 plus years, from Barry Goldwater up to you and others, warning people.
[02:14:28.952 --> 02:14:31.153]  And so now how does that affect the battle space?
[02:14:31.393 --> 02:14:32.214]  Where does this go?
[02:14:32.914 --> 02:14:34.195]  And why is Islam
[02:14:35.316 --> 02:14:42.037]  As I think you correctly predicted over a decade ago, the secret skeleton key weapon that they're going to use to finish their world government takeover.
[02:14:44.338 --> 02:14:49.899]  Well Alex, the goal obviously is control.
[02:14:50.099 --> 02:15:01.542]  They want to consolidate power, they want to institute a global system, and all the pieces are in place right now to make that happen.
[02:15:02.322 --> 02:15:02.962]  With the internet,
[02:15:03.815 --> 02:15:15.539]  With the possibility of going cashless for the world currencies and soon to be just a single currency, I think that's definitely their goal.
[02:15:17.780 --> 02:15:25.862]  They have this game plan and they are indeed, just as you said, playing one group off of another to make all this happen.
[02:15:26.282 --> 02:15:29.283]  And as I mentioned at the beginning of the last hour, the
[02:15:31.417 --> 02:15:41.719]  The real tool that's being used right now, following the end of the Cold War, is using radical Islam as a pawn.
[02:15:42.740 --> 02:15:50.481]  And as I mentioned before, I think that that pawn may actually be a knight or a queen in hiding.
[02:15:51.002 --> 02:15:57.043]  It's going to turn against them with dramatic results when all is said and done.
[02:15:58.612 --> 02:16:11.990]  We are seeing this all play out and the pace at which change is taking place is getting faster and faster and faster.
[02:16:12.170 --> 02:16:14.734]  And they're trying to manipulate this whole game.
[02:16:16.101 --> 02:16:17.682]  They're keeping people in the dark.
[02:16:18.022 --> 02:16:19.042]  They're failing at that.
[02:16:19.422 --> 02:16:22.023]  And at this point, it's going to come down to crisis.
[02:16:22.403 --> 02:16:36.589]  Whether it's a global pandemic, whether it's a global economic collapse, or whether it's a global war, they're going to have to play the crisis card very soon because they basically lost control economically.
[02:16:37.749 --> 02:16:42.611]  And they have lost, they don't realize it yet, but they have lost the information war.
[02:16:44.531 --> 02:16:46.913]  People like you have woken up too many people.
[02:16:48.254 --> 02:16:56.260]  And at this point, the only arrow left in their quiver is absolute crisis.
[02:16:59.242 --> 02:16:59.722]  That's right.
[02:17:00.323 --> 02:17:02.184]  And we're now going into it.
[02:17:04.206 --> 02:17:07.428]  Hillary admitted they're losing the information war four years ago to Congress.
[02:17:09.469 --> 02:17:12.672]  But I don't think she even realizes how much they've lost the information war.
[02:17:14.682 --> 02:17:19.784]  Is there any way to get these cornered rats to not destroy everything to keep power?
[02:17:19.824 --> 02:17:40.914]  Couldn't the states get together in a first-run constitutional convention just to have letters of demand and basically tell the top operatives, stop their anti-American activities, don't shut down power plants, don't let China have unfair trade deals, start there, and then give them a year to exit
[02:17:42.065 --> 02:17:51.435]  The United States, I mean, that of course, as you know, is a student of history, Mr. Rawls, has been done before with corrupt elites who are like a cancer and are too hard to dislodge.
[02:17:51.836 --> 02:17:58.042]  I mean, could some type of through-the-system armistice happen and just have these people flake off?
[02:17:58.743 --> 02:17:59.624]  That is possible.
[02:17:59.704 --> 02:18:09.591]  And I think one venue for that may be the upcoming Republican National Convention, because they don't control all of those individual delegates.
[02:18:10.552 --> 02:18:24.723]  And once a party convention is in a lot of ways like a constitutional convention, once the floor is open, if enough people call for
[02:18:26.258 --> 02:18:26.959]  I think
[02:18:47.742 --> 02:18:56.595]  That's right, because when they engage in this open theft, it is going to be a huge wake-up call on top of the wake-up call that's already happening, and people are really going to see through it.
[02:18:57.837 --> 02:19:03.965]  Do you think it's arrogance overall, or fear that they're just nakedly going, yeah, your vote doesn't count, get used to it, all over TV?
[02:19:06.226 --> 02:19:09.128]  Well, the level of arrogance is just horrendous.
[02:19:10.148 --> 02:19:23.357]  To think that they can attempt to stage-manage an entire political convention by manipulating the rules of that convention.
[02:19:23.397 --> 02:19:24.758]  I think it may backfire on them.
[02:19:27.759 --> 02:19:29.141]  A lot of two things are going to happen.
[02:19:29.662 --> 02:19:38.197]  Either there's going to be absolute pandemonium on the floor, or there's going to be a walkout of a lot of delegates.
[02:19:38.678 --> 02:19:41.342]  They may just walk to a hotel across the street.
[02:19:42.612 --> 02:19:44.933]  And start their own convention.
[02:19:45.013 --> 02:19:45.674]  That's the idea.
[02:19:45.734 --> 02:19:50.537]  I'm going to call Roger Stone right now because obviously his former business partner now is pretty much the head of the campaign.
[02:19:50.817 --> 02:19:52.818]  They've still got Lewandowski over there on the side.
[02:19:53.678 --> 02:19:56.240]  But wow, that is a great idea.
[02:19:56.260 --> 02:19:59.882]  And I kind of think that's what may be actually planned, but it's funny you brought that up.
[02:20:02.082 --> 02:20:04.024]  Well, again, things are spinning out of control.
[02:20:04.465 --> 02:20:14.956]  And at this point, again, I think it's going to come down to a massive crisis of some sort as kind of a last ditch effort for them to maintain their control.
[02:20:15.476 --> 02:20:17.018]  And as things get more out of control.
[02:20:17.138 --> 02:20:17.879]  Sure, sure.
[02:20:17.959 --> 02:20:19.060]  As things get more out of control.
[02:20:19.841 --> 02:20:21.543]  It's going to get more out of control and more out of control.
[02:20:21.563 --> 02:20:33.453]  Let's say on a scale of one to a hundred, a hundred being the most out of control, you know, full-on nuclear war happening and just total insanity and, you know, zero being volholic pastoral utopias.
[02:20:33.814 --> 02:20:35.035]  Where are we on that scale, sir?
[02:20:36.084 --> 02:20:40.985]  Well, I'd say we're somewhere in the 80s or the 90s here right now.
[02:20:42.186 --> 02:20:43.506]  They're losing control.
[02:20:43.526 --> 02:21:01.772]  And at this point, unless they have a crisis that they can use as the excuse to collapse the stock market, cause a banking crisis, and institute a global currency,
[02:21:02.731 --> 02:21:08.814]  They'll need something of that scale to continue to consolidate power.
[02:21:08.934 --> 02:21:12.156]  Otherwise, power is going to slip through their grasp.
[02:21:12.256 --> 02:21:20.200]  And so what you keep hammering is, they're going to pull a crisis, they're going to false flag, or they're going to wind somebody up, and they're going to create a crisis to be the saviors.
[02:21:20.540 --> 02:21:24.642]  It's so huge it diverts from stealing elections and everything else.
[02:21:28.124 --> 02:21:30.125]  Yeah, they'll probably have a
[02:21:31.637 --> 02:21:31.817]  I don't
[02:21:48.385 --> 02:21:56.152]  of a key political figure or a key candidate that they'll then try to pin on the Patriot movement, for example.
[02:21:56.172 --> 02:21:56.613]  That's right.
[02:21:56.693 --> 02:22:01.538]  So they could false flag and kill Donald Trump and blame it on the Patriots, or they could do it to Obama.
[02:22:01.578 --> 02:22:07.383]  That's what my gut's been telling me is we're entering the season of a political assassination to be pinned on one group or the other.
[02:22:07.663 --> 02:22:09.305]  It won't matter if it ever gets proven.
[02:22:09.625 --> 02:22:11.047]  It'll just cause war on the streets.
[02:22:11.755 --> 02:22:16.400]  Yes, and there literally will be blood in the streets if that happens.
[02:22:17.161 --> 02:22:31.416]  And again, getting back to the political conventions, the party conventions, coming out of the Democratic Convention, or more likely out of the Republican Convention, we could see a huge uproar, especially if they attempt to
[02:22:33.530 --> 02:22:41.777]  To broker this convention and put an insider in, in place of one of the two perceived outsiders.
[02:22:43.999 --> 02:22:47.723]  And that's the only way, I mean look, I'll be honest, I don't want to scare people.
[02:22:49.346 --> 02:23:05.403]  They could do stuff like a low-yield nuke in Cleveland and then, you know, have Obama declare a civil emergency saying, you know, in a year now we're gonna have an election and then basically, I mean, all the preparations I see is if they're planning something humongous and I don't want to...
[02:23:05.783 --> 02:23:10.807]  Speculate here, but I said before 9-11, look for him to blow up the World Trade Centers and blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[02:23:11.248 --> 02:23:30.343]  I'm not saying there isn't radical Islam, obviously Saudi Arabia, the 28 pages, I was just saying, I could see the preparation, I could see them beta testing, I could see them getting everybody ready, and then I called it exactly as they did it, and I'm telling you, I've never seen such frightening rhetoric, Obama's hyping nuclear terror, everybody else is, saying oh mushroom cloud over Manhattan,
[02:23:32.273 --> 02:23:40.256]  In your gut and your sources, what are some of the false flag triggers you think that activating the ISIS Al Qaeda sleeper cells they have all over the U.S.?
[02:23:40.276 --> 02:23:41.037]  What do you think it could be?
[02:23:42.177 --> 02:23:50.561]  It could very well be ISIS here in the United States or another major event in Europe.
[02:23:51.462 --> 02:23:55.804]  But I think they, at this point, see the need to step things up a notch.
[02:23:56.164 --> 02:24:02.847]  So it won't just be guys pulling out AK-47s and hand grenades and shouting, Allahu Akbar.
[02:24:03.427 --> 02:24:13.152]  It's going to be more like nuclear dirty bombs or even nuclear devices that reach critical mass, actual nuclear weapons.
[02:24:14.309 --> 02:24:24.671]  Or biological warfare agents or massive use of chemical agents in a confined but heavily populated space.
[02:24:24.771 --> 02:24:33.854]  And by that I mean something like a subway or a stadium full of people where there wouldn't just be dozens of deaths or hundreds of deaths.
[02:24:33.874 --> 02:24:37.034]  There could be thousands of simultaneous deaths.
[02:24:37.214 --> 02:24:43.276]  And that is the level they want to step things up to that level.
[02:24:44.198 --> 02:24:49.107]  Because it's only out of that level of crisis that they can call for something like martial law.
[02:24:51.531 --> 02:24:55.298]  Wow, and they've already got, quote, civil emergencies in Germany and France suspending people's rights.
[02:24:56.420 --> 02:24:57.081]  It's amazing.
[02:24:58.072 --> 02:24:58.892]  What do we do?
[02:24:58.912 --> 02:25:00.533]  I mean, I guess we call mainstream media.
[02:25:00.613 --> 02:25:01.974]  We do our own shows.
[02:25:02.034 --> 02:25:03.074]  Everybody does videos.
[02:25:03.154 --> 02:25:06.395]  Everybody becomes their own activist and says, we don't want nuclear terror.
[02:25:07.056 --> 02:25:11.497]  If there's nuclear Islamic terror, we hold you responsible, Mr. President.
[02:25:11.877 --> 02:25:14.178]  You know, we know you're cooking something.
[02:25:14.919 --> 02:25:16.499]  You know, hey, ugly, we know you're cooking.
[02:25:16.999 --> 02:25:21.201]  You know, don't cook it up for me to reverse what Hank Williams said.
[02:25:21.241 --> 02:25:23.222]  I mean, this is what do we do to stop it?
[02:25:25.419 --> 02:25:35.963]  I really don't know an ideal solution other than to continue to wake people up and encourage people to not give up completely on the political process.
[02:25:36.283 --> 02:25:45.466]  I hear so many people who say, it's all over, we can't do anything, no matter who gets into office they're going to pack the Supreme Court, blah blah blah.
[02:25:45.946 --> 02:25:48.567]  No, I think there still is hope for the political process.
[02:25:48.807 --> 02:25:54.429]  So people need to be aware, they need to be politically active, they need to be incredibly vocal.
[02:25:55.646 --> 02:25:57.550]  And don't be buffaloed.
[02:25:59.073 --> 02:26:05.266]  There's going to be a lot of changes going on in our country in the next five years.
[02:26:06.127 --> 02:26:11.149]  Where they're going to use hate speech laws to try to silence people.
[02:26:11.169 --> 02:26:11.469]  I agree.
[02:26:11.489 --> 02:26:12.710]  I want to talk about that next.
[02:26:12.730 --> 02:26:15.651]  Because the answer is everybody use your speech or lose it.
[02:26:15.671 --> 02:26:16.752]  They're openly announcing it.
[02:26:16.812 --> 02:26:17.992]  And I want to come back and go to calls.
[02:26:18.813 --> 02:26:21.254]  But separately, James Wesley Rawls, SurvivalBlog.com.
[02:26:21.514 --> 02:26:29.677]  Again, joining us here, if you just tuned in, I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com, syndicated radio slash TV transmission every day, 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[02:26:29.717 --> 02:26:30.018]  Eastern.
[02:26:31.238 --> 02:26:34.980]  Looking at this and looking at the different things that they're pulling,
[02:26:36.041 --> 02:26:44.824]  I also think it's important to reach out to some of the bots and some of the mainline liberals who come out to protest Trump and want to actually talk to Trump supporters.
[02:26:45.284 --> 02:26:47.365]  I see a lot of videos where people are actually coming together.
[02:26:47.645 --> 02:26:50.466]  That's not getting a lot of coverage in the media, but it's happening.
[02:26:50.486 --> 02:27:01.090]  I mean, when Louis Farrakhan says, we don't need to bring more Muslims in because they're going to blow stuff up and then regular Muslims are going to get blamed, nobody covered that because it makes Trump look so common sense.
[02:27:01.150 --> 02:27:03.551]  And so I really see them being afraid
[02:27:04.571 --> 02:27:07.173]  Of during this crisis, everybody trying to reach out to each other.
[02:27:07.433 --> 02:27:08.614]  I mean, I think that's a big part of this.
[02:27:10.055 --> 02:27:29.631]  Yeah, if their goal is to divide groups and the groups throw that back in their face by actually showing some cohesiveness and a unity of voice saying, yes, we want less government, we want less control, we want more individual freedom.
[02:27:30.743 --> 02:27:33.304]  That's going to really throw a monkey wrench into their plans.
[02:27:33.645 --> 02:27:36.646]  They want to continue to divide and conquer.
[02:27:37.647 --> 02:27:48.032]  And if we can actually find some common ground with people on the other end of the political spectrum, it's going to thwart their plans.
[02:27:48.772 --> 02:27:52.114]  Separately, you bring up the political process.
[02:27:53.433 --> 02:27:54.274]  It's become fake.
[02:27:54.294 --> 02:27:55.275]  It's become a fraud.
[02:27:55.415 --> 02:27:58.517]  But as we get involved, we expose the voting machines.
[02:27:59.438 --> 02:28:01.420]  As we run for office, good people get elected.
[02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:02.200]  It's a battle.
[02:28:02.220 --> 02:28:03.101]  We're fighting crooks.
[02:28:03.521 --> 02:28:08.185]  Good men and women always trump them, pun intended, when we finally take action.
[02:28:08.545 --> 02:28:09.406]  It may take 10 years.
[02:28:09.426 --> 02:28:10.207]  It may take 30 years.
[02:28:10.227 --> 02:28:11.068]  It may take 6 months.
[02:28:11.328 --> 02:28:12.429]  You never know how it's going to work.
[02:28:12.529 --> 02:28:13.610]  We have the moral high ground.
[02:28:13.950 --> 02:28:17.072]  And by going there and forcing them to steal the nomination,
[02:28:17.953 --> 02:28:19.953]  That only accelerates the awakening.
[02:28:19.973 --> 02:28:22.594]  People think, oh, it's correct, give up, you can't fix it.
[02:28:22.634 --> 02:28:31.996]  No, I've always said resistance is victory because in my own life, but also studying history, it's the animating contest of liberty that empowers our liberty muscles.
[02:28:32.036 --> 02:28:32.556]  Mr. Rawls?
[02:28:33.956 --> 02:28:34.957]  I agree with you, Alex.
[02:28:36.697 --> 02:28:40.398]  The political process still has hope.
[02:28:41.598 --> 02:28:46.739]  There's still at least a kernel of hope there for America, and we cannot give up on the process.
[02:28:47.261 --> 02:28:49.063]  Well, look at how fast people are waking up right now.
[02:28:50.164 --> 02:29:05.923]  Well, people are indeed waking up, and seeing what comes out of the Republican convention, if it is, if they do their broker deal and they have, they do their, what it really comes down to is power brokering, and people see that,
[02:29:07.601 --> 02:29:12.746]  I think they can't stop people from waking up to what's really going on.
[02:29:13.046 --> 02:29:21.233]  And people who have called themselves Republicans for many, many years are going to suddenly stop calling themselves Republicans if they see the convention.
[02:29:21.273 --> 02:29:21.593]  That's right.
[02:29:21.673 --> 02:29:23.215]  It's a Democratic Party plan.
[02:29:23.235 --> 02:29:24.136]  They're the dominant party.
[02:29:24.176 --> 02:29:27.879]  The Republicans, since the Rockefeller days, just play along.
[02:29:28.199 --> 02:29:30.081]  They're preparing to finally go ahead and kill the party.
[02:29:31.460 --> 02:29:35.882]  Uh, entirely, and create one party rule with a vestigial Republican Party in the South.
[02:29:36.202 --> 02:29:37.483]  This is the true fall of America.
[02:29:37.503 --> 02:29:38.303]  I want to get your take on that.
[02:29:38.343 --> 02:29:39.864]  James Wesley Rawls, survivalblog.com.
[02:29:39.884 --> 02:29:51.830]  I want to talk about the caliphate, and then go right to calls, talk about your new novel, straight ahead, that folks can find in bookstores everywhere, survivalblog.com, in the, uh, land of promise, first book in the counter-caliphate chronicles.
[02:29:57.285 --> 02:30:00.274]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.217 --> 02:30:03.905]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:08.052 --> 02:30:10.493]  Going out and protesting Islamophobia?
[02:30:10.533 --> 02:30:12.294]  Guess what you've probably been looking for.
[02:30:12.455 --> 02:30:16.297]  Sharia-friendly social networks for Muslims are now on the rise.
[02:30:16.497 --> 02:30:17.017]  Hooray!
[02:30:17.277 --> 02:30:19.899]  Article up by Forbes.com.
[02:30:20.079 --> 02:30:32.405]  A month ago, while attending the Startup Turkey conference in Antalya, I had the chance to talk to Shoaib Faddi, CEO and co-founder of the social networking platform... Now get ready, this is the best part... MuslimFace!
[02:30:32.445 --> 02:30:35.107]  MuslimFace is gonna be used to help combat Islamophobia.
[02:30:35.307 --> 02:30:36.548]  Created by Donald Trump.
[02:30:36.728 --> 02:30:40.130]  Definitely not created by that racist title called Muslim Face.
[02:30:40.290 --> 02:30:42.871]  You look like you could probably be a member of Muslim Face.
[02:30:43.052 --> 02:30:44.332]  What gave you that idea?
[02:30:44.512 --> 02:30:45.893]  Well, you kind of look like a Muslim.
[02:30:46.033 --> 02:30:56.619]  He was there to pitch to potential investors his website, which also offers prayer times, job postings, a tool to locate your nearest mosque, and another button to help find your spouse.
[02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:01.262]  Now, it might not be seen the best of times to write about Islamic online content.
[02:31:01.402 --> 02:31:03.543]  You just named your website Muslim Face.
[02:31:03.743 --> 02:31:04.524]  Come on, man.

[02:32:07.475 --> 02:32:07.935]  Hey, everyone!
[02:32:08.295 --> 02:32:10.536]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[02:32:10.576 --> 02:32:14.156]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:32:14.416 --> 02:32:16.017]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:32:16.497 --> 02:32:26.419]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:32:26.779 --> 02:32:32.740]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:32:33.160 --> 02:32:33.581]  We're good to go!
[02:32:48.097 --> 02:32:48.578]  I think so.
[02:33:22.310 --> 02:33:23.011]  Big Brother.
[02:33:23.472 --> 02:33:24.735]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:25.356 --> 02:33:26.498]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:26.999 --> 02:33:27.961]  You want answers?
[02:33:28.522 --> 02:33:29.664]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:30.165 --> 02:33:33.831]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:36.189 --> 02:33:45.755]  Look, I don't want to get up here on a high horse, but I grew up in a family that was heavily informed about politics and what was really going on in the world.
[02:33:45.915 --> 02:33:48.397]  And I didn't think anything big deal of it when I was a kid.
[02:33:48.417 --> 02:33:53.180]  Now talk about this, people use it as a discrediting point and act like it's a secret and play a clip from the show.
[02:33:53.220 --> 02:33:54.221]  I'm saying it on my show.
[02:33:54.921 --> 02:34:02.104]  That there were a lot of people that were army officers, a lot of people that worked at intelligence agencies, people that knew about what was going on.
[02:34:02.124 --> 02:34:10.988]  They were all like Mr. America, like Superman characters, just like Mr. I mean absolutely change old lady's tires, go get blood, go to the Salvation Army on Christmas.
[02:34:12.088 --> 02:34:12.969]  Good Christian people.
[02:34:14.031 --> 02:34:16.073]  And they were manipulated into this whole system.
[02:34:16.093 --> 02:34:20.277]  And by the time I was a little kid, I mean, people come over, family come over and stuff.
[02:34:20.337 --> 02:34:24.601]  I would just hear about the Federal Reserve, the takeover, and the communists, and they're going to break up the family.
[02:34:24.621 --> 02:34:25.942]  You can't believe what these people are doing.
[02:34:25.962 --> 02:34:34.269]  And just people sitting around the coffee table, just like, you know, Dallas cops coming in and FBI agents and, you know, people running around, you know, just freaking out.
[02:34:34.329 --> 02:34:36.411]  And I'm like five years old, like watching all this.
[02:34:39.758 --> 02:34:45.419]  You know, like family getting blown up in Guatemala and being shipped in on a C-130 and, you know, just all sorts of stuff.
[02:34:45.519 --> 02:34:55.101]  And, I mean, Buckley works here and his dad was down there and they were routinely attacked by rebels in the government district and the house blown up they were in because it had all the antennas on the roof.
[02:34:55.221 --> 02:34:56.862]  I mean, I'm not going to get into the whole deal.
[02:34:57.142 --> 02:35:01.243]  Just the point is that I sit here and I know this is all real.
[02:35:02.103 --> 02:35:04.365]  I know they're coming after us, and you need to understand something.
[02:35:04.705 --> 02:35:11.231]  The globalists, they love third world, they love radicalism, they love authoritarianism because it's like them.
[02:35:11.612 --> 02:35:13.353]  They hate Christians.
[02:35:13.393 --> 02:35:14.594]  They hate America.
[02:35:14.874 --> 02:35:16.055]  They hate free market.
[02:35:16.476 --> 02:35:17.897]  They hate all of it.
[02:35:18.978 --> 02:35:22.621]  And they want totalitarianism to have their way with us.
[02:35:24.623 --> 02:35:25.964]  They're really bad news, people.
[02:35:25.984 --> 02:35:26.605]  You need to understand.
[02:35:27.810 --> 02:35:29.630]  People think it's brave to fight them.
[02:35:29.810 --> 02:35:35.131]  I'd be the most brave person in the world to not resist the globalists.
[02:35:38.352 --> 02:35:51.534]  If I'm out on a sailboat in the middle of a great lake and all of a sudden a huge leak forms and the boat's going to sink and it's freezing water, I'm going to be bailing as fast as I can to get back to shore, not because I have courage.
[02:35:52.235 --> 02:35:54.375]  I'm going to be busting my butt because I want to live.
[02:35:55.526 --> 02:35:57.387]  That's why I don't call up and say I'm a hero.
[02:35:57.947 --> 02:35:59.708]  Do not call up and say how great I am.
[02:35:59.768 --> 02:36:02.449]  Folks, it's normal to fight this.
[02:36:03.250 --> 02:36:04.710]  It's abnormal not to.
[02:36:07.732 --> 02:36:11.614]  These people are really bad, and humanity deserves not to go through this anymore.
[02:36:12.914 --> 02:36:17.036]  You've seen all the tyrannies, and most governments are horrible and oppressive, and now you see the way we're going.
[02:36:17.517 --> 02:36:18.097]  It's bad news.
[02:36:18.117 --> 02:36:20.598]  I want to go back and get into Zoo Novel, take your phone calls.
[02:36:20.978 --> 02:36:22.179]  I'm not going to belabor this, but
[02:36:23.118 --> 02:36:42.070]  You need to understand that the reason I can be on the same page with somebody like Rawls, or the same page as a Colonel Schaeffer, or the same page as a Tosh Plumley whistleblower, or the same page as a Lieutenant Marine Corps Colonel that was on last week, or the same page as everybody else, or the same page as congressmen that come on the show, like Walter Jones, is because it's a real page.
[02:36:43.951 --> 02:36:45.112]  Like the Sammy Hagar song.
[02:36:46.313 --> 02:36:46.953]  It's a fact.
[02:36:47.994 --> 02:36:49.915]  Not my point of view, and you know it's true.
[02:36:50.696 --> 02:36:52.397]  And so, debate's over!
[02:36:55.029 --> 02:37:03.169]  We have a scientific tyranny coming in that's very easy to defeat because it's so big and stinking and open and has been so arrogant.
[02:37:05.660 --> 02:37:08.241]  Because all the other tyrannies came as tanks or weapons or troops.
[02:37:09.021 --> 02:37:13.503]  So they thought, oh, we're corporate, we're sophisticated, the hillbillies won't look at what we're doing.
[02:37:14.023 --> 02:37:16.344]  Well, the hillbillies wouldn't look when everything was still pretty nice.
[02:37:16.424 --> 02:37:18.684]  Now they're looking and they're finding out, you did it.
[02:37:19.145 --> 02:37:20.485]  You're not getting away with this.
[02:37:21.025 --> 02:37:22.686]  You won't be safe anywhere with your money.
[02:37:23.226 --> 02:37:27.127]  I don't have some big raging thing to prove to want a war with you.
[02:37:27.307 --> 02:37:27.928]  I'm not an idiot.
[02:37:28.268 --> 02:37:29.788]  I want to stop this now.
[02:37:32.969 --> 02:37:34.410]  So I hope listeners and people understand
[02:37:37.062 --> 02:37:37.883]  This isn't a game.
[02:37:38.803 --> 02:37:44.228]  And when I say, tell your friends and family about the show, Infowars.com, Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:37:45.248 --> 02:37:52.194]  When I tell you go to Infowars.com forward slash show and download the free iPhone out of the Droid app or to send out articles or to send out podcasts.
[02:37:53.598 --> 02:37:55.379]  Some people go, well the government will get me if I do that.
[02:37:55.539 --> 02:37:56.259]  We're the government.
[02:37:56.339 --> 02:37:57.019]  We're the people.
[02:37:57.299 --> 02:37:59.080]  The military is ignoring all these threats.
[02:37:59.560 --> 02:38:01.540]  Just like Rawls said, they're coming after our free speech.
[02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:05.041]  Now is the time to stand, to protest, to demonstrate.
[02:38:05.301 --> 02:38:06.742]  You think I want to go to Cleveland?
[02:38:07.422 --> 02:38:08.282]  When I got three little kids?
[02:38:08.302 --> 02:38:09.602]  You think I really want to get up there?
[02:38:10.623 --> 02:38:12.043]  You think I really want to be all over the streets?
[02:38:12.063 --> 02:38:15.124]  I'm going to be there.
[02:38:17.565 --> 02:38:19.345]  Because I'm afraid of letting these people win.
[02:38:19.365 --> 02:38:22.186]  A lot more than I'm afraid of what could happen to me.
[02:38:25.137 --> 02:38:26.038]  Stuff in the game, people.
[02:38:26.058 --> 02:38:27.999]  These people want to hurt you and your family.
[02:38:28.019 --> 02:38:28.680]  Okay, you understand that?
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:30.841]  They hate you because you're a good person.
[02:38:30.861 --> 02:38:31.922]  They want to dominate you.
[02:38:32.122 --> 02:38:34.664]  Where is your instinct that God gave you to resist these people?
[02:38:38.647 --> 02:38:38.987]  Get up!
[02:38:39.827 --> 02:38:40.428]  Take action!
[02:38:41.589 --> 02:38:45.552]  I want to see our stories, our videos, Rawls material, everything plastered everywhere.
[02:38:45.912 --> 02:38:46.632]  This is a war!
[02:38:48.033 --> 02:38:50.015]  I have climbed up on the billboards at night, personally.
[02:38:50.964 --> 02:38:52.345]  I have put the flyers everywhere.
[02:38:52.785 --> 02:38:53.865]  I have flown around on airplanes.
[02:38:53.925 --> 02:38:55.506]  I've done stuff I don't even talk about on air.
[02:38:55.746 --> 02:38:56.886]  And I'm not going to get into it here today.
[02:38:57.287 --> 02:38:58.527]  I do it at the grocery store.
[02:38:58.847 --> 02:38:59.928]  I do it at church, everywhere.
[02:39:01.729 --> 02:39:02.969]  Because I'm fighting for my life.
[02:39:02.989 --> 02:39:03.629]  You understand that?
[02:39:04.890 --> 02:39:07.211]  You're in a fight for your life and your children's future.
[02:39:07.231 --> 02:39:08.451]  You need to act like it.
[02:39:08.631 --> 02:39:09.972]  And I'm not bitching at anybody.
[02:39:10.332 --> 02:39:12.453]  But they've put us into a trance, myself included.
[02:39:12.953 --> 02:39:19.136]  And I need people to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get the Hillary for President t-shirts, to get the Molon Lombe, to meet like-minded people.
[02:39:20.151 --> 02:39:21.876]  And to spread the word and support the transmission.
[02:39:23.741 --> 02:39:25.104]  We brought the Hillary for Prison shirt back.
[02:39:25.125 --> 02:39:25.726]  It's been augmented.
[02:39:25.746 --> 02:39:27.250]  It's a new edition, but it looks pretty much the same.
[02:39:28.069 --> 02:39:30.371]  We also have the new Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:39:30.391 --> 02:39:32.812]  You absolutely need that with your diet to boost your health.
[02:39:32.872 --> 02:39:34.313]  Everything else, it's a game changer.
[02:39:34.453 --> 02:39:38.796]  X2, Super Mel Vitality, the Methylcobalamin, Vitamin B12, Secret 12's back in.
[02:39:39.116 --> 02:39:44.200]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:39:44.580 --> 02:39:51.945]  I want the money to have more reporters be able to go and cover everything and not spend all my time jacking around trying to get sponsors.
[02:39:51.965 --> 02:39:52.665]  And I'm not complaining.
[02:39:53.106 --> 02:39:55.287]  But we need fuel in this war.
[02:39:55.607 --> 02:39:57.469]  We need to be strong to face the enemy.
[02:39:58.189 --> 02:39:58.689]  In the storm.
[02:39:58.949 --> 02:40:00.550]  And I thank you all for your support.
[02:40:00.750 --> 02:40:01.710]  I know it's rough out there.
[02:40:02.090 --> 02:40:03.630]  Thank you for your prayers, first and foremost.
[02:40:03.950 --> 02:40:10.672]  All right, Mr. Rawls, I want to give you the floor for about six, seven, eight minutes, because I just get really excited talking about all this stuff, because things are so earnest now.
[02:40:10.732 --> 02:40:11.572]  It's all happening now.
[02:40:11.632 --> 02:40:12.452]  We've been proven right.
[02:40:12.952 --> 02:40:19.854]  How does it feel for you, writing for 30 years, to now see it all proven right, and to see that your work has become basically prescient?
[02:40:20.814 --> 02:40:23.815]  I mean, I know personally, I'm not excited about the fact I've been proven right.
[02:40:23.855 --> 02:40:24.855]  It's a very sick feeling.
[02:40:25.235 --> 02:40:28.176]  But at least we've been proven right, so more people pay attention now.
[02:40:28.576 --> 02:40:29.776]  And then let's get into the caliphate.
[02:40:31.056 --> 02:40:31.236]  Sure.
[02:40:31.256 --> 02:40:47.900]  Well, it is gratifying to see that, you know, back in 1990, when I wrote the first draft of my first novel, people were saying that it was absolutely inconceivable to see a stock market collapse and a collapse in the U.S.
[02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:49.520]  dollar as a currency unit.
[02:40:50.834 --> 02:40:52.935]  And now people aren't saying that anymore.
[02:40:53.615 --> 02:40:56.476]  They recognize that it really is a possibility.
[02:40:57.616 --> 02:41:00.297]  And it is gratifying to see that people are waking up.
[02:41:01.117 --> 02:41:17.222]  But beyond that, it's important that as people wake up, they're politically active, they don't hold back from sharing this knowledge with their friends, and that they are fully committed
[02:41:18.311 --> 02:41:19.412]  to the fight ahead of them.
[02:41:19.552 --> 02:41:29.097]  You know, the old joke is that when the farmer was putting together breakfast, the chicken was involved, but the pig was committed.
[02:41:29.938 --> 02:41:41.225]  And that's the stage that we're at right now, where we have to be fully committed to this, because the battle is on.
[02:41:43.766 --> 02:41:59.664]  It's right before us and what I'm trying to do with my new novel series, the Counter Caliphate series, is to wake people up to the big picture of what's going on geopolitically and to point out to them that we're
[02:42:00.925 --> 02:42:05.406]  are not just victims of our circumstances, okay?
[02:42:05.866 --> 02:42:16.830]  We can actually make a change as individuals that we can individually push for the establishment of a Christian nation of refuge, for instance.
[02:42:16.870 --> 02:42:19.690]  That's what I put forth in the first novel in the series.
[02:42:21.531 --> 02:42:28.573]  That kind of change can take place and because we are a globally interconnected
[02:42:29.838 --> 02:42:30.238]  I think?
[02:42:51.377 --> 02:42:53.098]  These kind of changes will take place.
[02:42:53.478 --> 02:43:09.742]  And just like cockroaches scurrying away from the light, you turn enough lights on, like you're doing with all your educational quests, the roaches are going to go scurrying for cover.
[02:43:10.523 --> 02:43:18.405]  And people will realize that they individually can make a difference and they can truly change things.
[02:43:19.446 --> 02:43:25.327]  That's the encouraging thing, and that's why as a Christian and as a patriot, I hold out a lot of hope.
[02:43:25.847 --> 02:43:28.388]  Because I think in the long run, we are bound to win.
[02:43:28.408 --> 02:43:35.409]  As your promo says, we are on the march.
[02:43:37.569 --> 02:43:40.770]  We will prevail in the long run, and that's very encouraging.
[02:43:41.390 --> 02:43:45.551]  So I do encourage people to get active.
[02:43:47.072 --> 02:43:50.117]  And to share this knowledge as much as they can with others.
[02:43:52.301 --> 02:43:54.845]  No one knows who said it last time I checked.
[02:43:55.205 --> 02:43:58.751]  It's author unknown of the statement, there are no atheists in foxholes.
[02:43:59.659 --> 02:44:03.962]  But it is true that armies throughout history know about Providence.
[02:44:04.182 --> 02:44:06.163]  They know about trying to purify themselves.
[02:44:06.543 --> 02:44:08.024]  They know about trying to seek God.
[02:44:08.825 --> 02:44:15.689]  And that's because they've learned, even the most arrogant atheists, that you laugh at God, it's very unlucky.
[02:44:16.389 --> 02:44:18.831]  But you talk about George Washington and others.
[02:44:19.071 --> 02:44:22.393]  Providence is a real thing, and I've experienced it in my life.
[02:44:24.161 --> 02:44:32.168]  And I just feel sorry for people that really think that this world's a joke and who don't think there aren't good and evil forces active in the world.
[02:44:32.528 --> 02:44:36.812]  Those people are so spiritually blind, they have no idea what's coming or what they're about to face.
[02:44:38.734 --> 02:44:42.417]  Well, that's our real hope, really, is in Christ.
[02:44:43.018 --> 02:44:49.884]  And as we look at this whole global political mess that's developed,
[02:44:50.819 --> 02:45:04.109]  We can have hope in the certain knowledge of our salvation, and we can be absolutely fearless with that knowledge in the fight ahead, knowing that we know our destination.
[02:45:04.169 --> 02:45:06.832]  If we're going to heaven, they can't take that away from us.
[02:45:07.332 --> 02:45:08.913]  So we can be fearless in this fight.
[02:45:09.894 --> 02:45:13.597]  Other tidbits, other tidbits before we go to calls that you'd like to relay to the listeners today.
[02:45:21.994 --> 02:45:24.797]  Yeah, his Skype was breaking up and we just lost his audio.
[02:45:24.857 --> 02:45:25.698]  It should come back in a moment.
[02:45:25.718 --> 02:45:27.880]  Did his Skype completely disconnect?
[02:45:30.043 --> 02:45:31.064]  Okay, James, can you hear us?
[02:45:31.864 --> 02:45:32.605]  Yeah, I have you.
[02:45:33.206 --> 02:45:36.770]  Okay, any other little Ted Bits you want to add before we go to some calls?
[02:45:38.972 --> 02:45:42.275]  Well, I just want to encourage people to
[02:45:45.109 --> 02:45:46.169]  Wake up individually.
[02:45:46.389 --> 02:45:47.350]  Wake up their friends.
[02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:51.891]  It's time to stock up, team up, and train up.
[02:45:53.691 --> 02:45:56.592]  Because we're far beyond just politics with this now.
[02:45:57.092 --> 02:46:03.413]  And the problems that have been created are going to affect us on a physical level.
[02:46:03.613 --> 02:46:11.775]  I mean, in terms of individual sustenance, in terms of individual, you know, just personal security.
[02:46:12.768 --> 02:46:13.208]  Of course!
[02:46:37.433 --> 02:46:42.578]  Because those supplies just by themselves are kind of useless unless you know exactly what you're doing with them.
[02:46:42.858 --> 02:46:45.000]  There's a learning curve with all of these things.
[02:46:46.501 --> 02:46:50.945]  It's time truly folks to stock up, team up, and train up to be ready for the dark days ahead.
[02:46:52.318 --> 02:46:53.758]  And it only runs from bad to worse.
[02:46:53.778 --> 02:46:55.159]  We're not trying to be negative here, folks.
[02:46:55.199 --> 02:46:58.600]  They plan to collapse Western civilization to bring in social engineering.
[02:46:58.620 --> 02:47:00.800]  They're going to make you very poor and desperate to do that.
[02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:02.701]  They do it in every communist takeover.
[02:47:03.001 --> 02:47:11.543]  This is not a communist program, but the globalists are using communist re-education tools and even communist terminology now in army manuals that are declassified.
[02:47:11.643 --> 02:47:12.943]  So this is very, very dangerous.
[02:47:13.283 --> 02:47:14.443]  They use what's worked before.
[02:47:14.463 --> 02:47:16.864]  They've been preparing the ground here for a while.
[02:47:16.924 --> 02:47:19.885]  Tim in Wyoming has a question for our guest, Mr. Rawls.
[02:47:19.905 --> 02:47:20.485]  Go ahead, Tim.
[02:47:22.182 --> 02:47:24.523]  Yes, hello, thanks for taking my call.
[02:47:24.863 --> 02:47:34.005]  My question for you Mr. Rawls is, Alex asked this question of listeners yesterday and I never got a chance to call in and say what my line in the sand was.
[02:47:34.605 --> 02:47:40.047]  What is your line in the sand for when we should basically stand up and
[02:47:40.598 --> 02:47:42.018]  Be counted, so to speak.
[02:47:42.259 --> 02:47:47.040]  Because, I mean, I'm already doing as much as I can possibly do in my small town in Wyoming.
[02:47:47.060 --> 02:47:48.240]  I think a lot of that's targeting.
[02:47:48.460 --> 02:47:51.961]  I mean, the people around you are just minions of the system, so going after them doesn't do anything.
[02:47:52.401 --> 02:47:53.602]  That's why I'm defensive.
[02:47:53.642 --> 02:47:55.722]  At least if somebody's attacking me, I know they're in the wrong.
[02:47:56.123 --> 02:48:01.944]  But a lot of this is just exposing the operatives so that if everything does go to a shootin' war, people know who the foreign enemy is.
[02:48:01.984 --> 02:48:03.445]  But, Mr. Rawls, your comments?
[02:48:07.826 --> 02:48:07.986]  Right.
[02:48:08.482 --> 02:48:12.425]  Well, I think everybody has to draw their own individual line, as it were.
[02:48:12.905 --> 02:48:25.754]  Because for someone who is a single person, for example, without a family, without children to worry about, that line in the sand might be a lot farther out than someone who has a large family to worry about.
[02:48:26.314 --> 02:48:33.879]  That they're going to, you know, lock and load at a much later date than someone who doesn't have
[02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:38.382]  That level of responsibility for a family.
[02:48:38.422 --> 02:48:38.722]  That's right.
[02:48:38.842 --> 02:48:44.105]  My line in the sand is protect my family, protect my community, not be offensive.
[02:48:44.145 --> 02:48:45.526]  I'm offensive with information.
[02:48:45.746 --> 02:48:47.768]  And then try to be defensive like a mother hen.
[02:48:48.048 --> 02:48:51.730]  But then at what point then do you go aggressive?
[02:48:51.770 --> 02:48:56.733]  And boy, once the people that are in a mother hen position go aggressive, that's when heads really roll, historically, correct?
[02:48:57.918 --> 02:49:04.981]  Yes, and again, people have to be wise as serpents and meek as doves, as the Bible teaches.
[02:49:05.681 --> 02:49:22.787]  Right now, if you look at what happened with the Bundy Ranch and with the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, people who stood up too early, too vocally, and who made some tactical mistakes in terms of committing felonies on federal property are now
[02:49:24.909 --> 02:49:29.918]  Feeling the wrath of the federal government with multiple, multiple felony charges against you.
[02:49:29.958 --> 02:49:30.779]  They walk into your trap.
[02:49:32.001 --> 02:49:32.242]  Yes.
[02:49:32.963 --> 02:49:33.404]  Big time.
[02:49:33.985 --> 02:49:34.926]  And unfortunately...
[02:49:36.071 --> 02:49:40.977]  They all did it on camera, gave their names, and were seen on camera with weapons.
[02:49:41.037 --> 02:49:49.367]  And the sight of those weapons alone was used as felony charges of use of firearms to the commission of offense.
[02:49:49.427 --> 02:49:54.333]  And they thought just because they were in the right on a few issues, they didn't know about the optics.
[02:49:54.673 --> 02:49:55.675]  It was very, very foolish.
[02:49:56.894 --> 02:49:57.094]  Right.
[02:49:57.775 --> 02:50:01.019]  And so people have to be wise about that sort of thing.
[02:50:01.299 --> 02:50:02.981]  You have to pick your fights.
[02:50:03.302 --> 02:50:05.004]  You have to choose your battles wisely.
[02:50:05.565 --> 02:50:06.766]  Don't tilt at windmills.
[02:50:06.806 --> 02:50:13.494]  That's one reason I've never gotten involved in it, even though the tax system in the United States is inherently wrong.
[02:50:14.315 --> 02:50:19.238]  I chose not to fight the tax battle because I saw what happened to too many tax protesters.
[02:50:19.298 --> 02:50:32.445]  Exactly, we're fighting the general globalist occupied takeover, that it's a worldwide takeover, it's illegitimate, we're occupied, we're not fighting each tentacle, we're exposing to everyone that this is an illegitimate takeover that's now more naked than ever.
[02:50:34.586 --> 02:50:34.786]  Right.
[02:50:35.406 --> 02:50:42.530]  So, again, choose your battles wisely, and when you go to a public protest,
[02:50:43.479 --> 02:50:51.922]  You need to think very seriously about how far away you park your car, for example, so your license plate number won't be photographed.
[02:50:52.642 --> 02:50:55.583]  And whether or not you're going to disguise yourself.
[02:50:56.243 --> 02:50:59.504]  But don't be buffaloded and not attending at all.
[02:50:59.664 --> 02:51:02.845]  Well, I say either choose to be totally public or be underground.
[02:51:03.246 --> 02:51:04.246]  That's the model I think.
[02:51:04.266 --> 02:51:06.427]  People should either be completely underground or totally out in the open.
[02:51:06.747 --> 02:51:07.607]  I'm totally out in the open.
[02:51:10.656 --> 02:51:16.861]  December 7, 1941, a date which will live in infamy.
[02:51:17.162 --> 02:51:18.443]  Remember Pearl Harbor.

[02:53:08.476 --> 02:53:11.897]  Before using Heart and Body Extract, my energy level was very, very low.
[02:53:12.358 --> 02:53:15.239]  I could only walk a few feet and then would have to sit down.
[02:53:15.599 --> 02:53:16.900]  I was tired and lethargic.
[02:53:17.120 --> 02:53:24.424]  But after taking Heart and Body Extract, my energy level has improved greatly and I can now walk longer distances without getting tired so fast.

[02:54:27.412 --> 02:54:31.555]  Coming up at about 8 after, David Knight's going to take over to cover all the election news.
[02:54:31.575 --> 02:54:37.079]  A whole bunch of big interviews that our crew in multiple states have been getting following Donald Trump.
[02:54:37.880 --> 02:54:38.941]  That's in the fourth hour today.
[02:54:39.321 --> 02:54:40.922]  Many stations are picking up the fourth hour.
[02:54:40.962 --> 02:54:41.423]  Some don't.

[02:55:16.230 --> 02:55:23.315]  You know, I want to get Mr. Rawls on about his novel itself and Islam for a full hour or more in the near future, but right now
[02:55:24.315 --> 02:55:26.597]  Let's just go ahead and go back to calls.
[02:55:26.697 --> 02:55:29.279]  Speaking of the caliphate, Moore in Texas.
[02:55:29.299 --> 02:55:30.760]  You're on the air with James Wesley Rawls.
[02:55:32.161 --> 02:55:33.081]  How y'all doing today?
[02:55:33.101 --> 02:55:34.002]  Good brother, go ahead.
[02:55:34.022 --> 02:55:41.667]  My question, and I don't want to be long-winded, but my question is, the original founders of Islam was black people, and they weren't Arabs.
[02:55:42.147 --> 02:55:49.192]  So my question is, if the Europeans actually helped put the Arabs in charge, is it kind of like
[02:55:49.801 --> 02:55:56.987]  I don't want to say defective, but is it payback for them allying with Arabs instead of black people as they should have allied with?
[02:55:57.588 --> 02:55:58.349]  That's my question.
[02:55:58.369 --> 02:56:12.061]  Alright, well let me try to throw, I mean I get what you're saying, that it is true that the British Empire and others kind of set up Islam, put the Wahhabis in control, the worst sect obviously, who did say that black people weren't humans in their
[02:56:12.421 --> 02:56:15.943]  Well, to begin with, I think the whole concept of race is spurious.
[02:56:15.963 --> 02:56:17.785]  I think there's only one race, and that's the human race.
[02:56:17.805 --> 02:56:18.605]  And for many, many years,
[02:56:38.777 --> 02:56:53.989]  Kings and princes and parliaments have been trying to divide people by putting labels on the so-called races and to drive a wedge between people to create conflict, which they can then manage.
[02:56:54.801 --> 02:56:56.843]  To their, to meet their goals.
[02:56:57.323 --> 02:57:00.826]  So, I reject the whole concept of racism to begin with.
[02:57:00.846 --> 02:57:01.607]  Racist and racist.
[02:57:01.627 --> 02:57:03.048]  That's right, it's vulcanization.
[02:57:03.088 --> 02:57:04.369]  Thank you more, but it's an interesting question.
[02:57:04.389 --> 02:57:05.390]  Well, I mean, here's Mexico.
[02:57:06.030 --> 02:57:07.271]  Six months to a year hard labor.
[02:57:07.511 --> 02:57:08.332]  They torture you.
[02:57:08.752 --> 02:57:09.393]  They shock you.
[02:57:09.413 --> 02:57:09.833]  They beat you.
[02:57:09.873 --> 02:57:10.714]  That's in The Guardian.
[02:57:10.774 --> 02:57:12.576]  I said just last week, they beat you up.
[02:57:12.676 --> 02:57:14.897]  They tear, I mean, Mexico has some of the most draconian
[02:57:16.418 --> 02:57:19.240]  But they can't have huge third world populations coming in.
[02:57:19.260 --> 02:57:20.340]  They'll collapse even worse.
[02:57:20.380 --> 02:57:22.141]  I'm not saying what they're doing is good.
[02:57:22.481 --> 02:57:25.463]  How are we supposed to take all these people, though, and give them everything free?
[02:57:25.583 --> 02:57:27.584]  I'm not against these poor Latin Americans.
[02:57:27.904 --> 02:57:36.628]  But the globalists are bringing them in, turning them into a tribal, racial-based group, even if that's a fraud, to then ally with the socialists and vote our guns away.
[02:57:36.688 --> 02:57:38.389]  What do we do then, Mr. Rawls?
[02:57:40.103 --> 02:57:42.784]  Well, we need to reject racism.
[02:57:43.364 --> 02:57:47.566]  We need to point out when it's being used as a psychological weapon.
[02:57:47.586 --> 02:57:51.408]  And we can't we can't fall for the race baiting.
[02:57:52.428 --> 02:57:58.551]  It's important that we recognize that as American citizens, we represent
[02:57:59.986 --> 02:58:03.467]  The end result of what our founding fathers had in mind.
[02:58:04.107 --> 02:58:08.029]  And it actually worked remarkably well for many, many generations.
[02:58:08.809 --> 02:58:21.413]  And yeah, granted we're in dire straits right now, and we've read up a huge national debt, but they cannot extinguish the spirit of individual liberty that still exists in this country.
[02:58:21.433 --> 02:58:26.375]  I totally agree, but we can't have totally open borders and just bring people in and sign them up with the Socialists.
[02:58:27.526 --> 02:58:34.749]  No, that we have to be very protective of our borders.
[02:58:35.549 --> 02:58:42.152]  But for people who are American citizens, we have to fully bring them up in the culture.
[02:58:42.172 --> 02:58:42.552]  Absolutely.
[02:58:42.572 --> 02:58:45.334]  We need to bring them in to the Renaissance.
[02:58:45.354 --> 02:58:45.674]  70 seconds.
[02:58:45.814 --> 02:58:46.574]  Thank you, Mr. Rawls.
[02:58:46.594 --> 02:58:46.954]  Stay there.
[02:58:46.974 --> 02:58:49.135]  We'll be back with more calls, Matt and others.
[02:58:49.215 --> 02:58:51.576]  Infowars.com is the tip of the spear, folks.
[02:58:51.676 --> 02:58:53.757]  And I don't like that fact, but that's the way it is.
[02:58:53.977 --> 02:58:54.538]  So pray for us.
[02:58:54.598 --> 02:58:54.958]  We need it.
[02:58:54.998 --> 02:58:55.258]  Believe me.
[02:58:57.842 --> 02:59:01.565]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:59:01.805 --> 02:59:07.929]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:59:08.129 --> 02:59:15.114]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[02:59:15.394 --> 02:59:24.200]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[02:59:24.520 --> 02:59:30.445]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:59:30.685 --> 02:59:35.449]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:59:35.509 --> 02:59:38.851]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:59:39.112 --> 02:59:40.733]  No needles, no injections.
[02:59:40.993 --> 02:59:42.494]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:59:42.634 --> 02:59:43.695]  Try it for yourself.
[02:59:43.835 --> 02:59:45.417]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[02:59:52.924 --> 02:59:54.908]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:17.346 --> 03:00:24.730]  When the hitman comes, he knows that he's been cheated.
[03:00:26.230 --> 03:00:32.153]  The song says it all.
[03:00:32.173 --> 03:00:34.215]  When the hitman comes, he knows he's been cheated.
[03:00:35.375 --> 03:00:37.896]  Imagine a hitman not knowing where he's been sent to a city.
[03:00:38.877 --> 03:00:42.279]  He realizes when he gets there, he's gonna be given the picture of who he's gonna be killing and when.
[03:00:42.299 --> 03:00:44.820]  When they give him the photo, it's his son or daughter.
[03:00:48.744 --> 03:00:50.084]  Same thing, you're killing your future.
[03:00:50.965 --> 03:00:52.765]  You're lying to yourself, you think you're winning.
[03:00:54.006 --> 03:00:54.646]  Don't be part of it.
[03:00:56.386 --> 03:00:59.527]  But also, a lot of good people get guilted by the fact they've been involved in evil.
[03:01:00.388 --> 03:01:06.389]  And so then they just say, it's my lot, I'm supposed to stay with it, I'm a horrible person, and they drink themselves to death or whatever the case is.
[03:01:06.969 --> 03:01:09.450]  No, repent, get out of it, realize you were lied to.
[03:01:09.470 --> 03:01:15.312]  I know most people out there aren't government hit men, but that's just a parallel to what we're talking about.
[03:01:17.452 --> 03:01:23.308]  Cause I knew one and a family member and they were so sad and were just really upset people until the day they died.
[03:01:24.468 --> 03:01:29.711]  And they just said incrementally they got into it and the evil, and by the time they got out of it, it had wrecked them for the rest of their life.
[03:01:30.152 --> 03:01:30.812]  That's another big lie.
[03:01:30.832 --> 03:01:31.653]  You never get out of this stuff.
[03:01:31.673 --> 03:01:32.273]  That's not true.
[03:01:32.293 --> 03:01:33.914]  A lot of people get out of the evil, folks.
[03:01:34.494 --> 03:01:36.556]  But it's time to just stop being so naive.
[03:01:36.596 --> 03:01:39.538]  SurvivalBlog.com, the new book that I want to do a whole hour on.
[03:01:39.558 --> 03:01:40.038]  I want to read it.
[03:01:40.058 --> 03:01:40.598]  I haven't read it yet.
[03:01:40.618 --> 03:01:44.300]  It's got great reviews from a constitutional Christian libertarian perspective.
[03:01:44.601 --> 03:01:45.441]  It's Land of Promise.
[03:01:46.282 --> 03:01:49.244]  James Wesley Rawls kind of giving commentary, arriving shotgun on this today.
[03:01:49.284 --> 03:01:49.764]  It's been great.
[03:01:50.184 --> 03:01:51.285]  Matt, you're on the air.
[03:01:51.385 --> 03:01:52.726]  Go ahead with our guest.
[03:01:53.837 --> 03:01:57.261]  Hey, just a quick couple of comments, wishing you both health and strength.
[03:01:58.183 --> 03:02:05.231]  Alex, you mentioned yesterday in terms of the Cleveland Convention protest, be sure to make sure that folks know the dates.
[03:02:05.351 --> 03:02:08.736]  The dates that that convention is going on is on July 18th.
[03:02:08.856 --> 03:02:10.358]  Also, in terms of Ohio,
[03:02:11.131 --> 03:02:21.400]  People will vote for Trump because what you've got in Ohio, speaking as an Ohioan, is that the manufacturing-based cities, places like Dayton... Sure, KC obviously stole it.
[03:02:21.420 --> 03:02:22.921]  We're almost out of time, but a quick question.
[03:02:23.401 --> 03:02:26.744]  Yes, we're gonna have websites, the date, the demonstrations, believe me, in the next few days.
[03:02:26.784 --> 03:02:27.245]  We're coming.
[03:02:27.265 --> 03:02:29.246]  I'm gonna be at the tip of the spear with Roger Stone.
[03:02:29.286 --> 03:02:29.607]  Get ready.
[03:02:29.627 --> 03:02:31.068]  Do you have any quick questions for our guest?
[03:02:32.012 --> 03:02:46.680]  Just a quick note, for whatever it's worth, they had an announcement the other day in one of the regional newspapers in Northwest Ohio that Toledo, Ohio is basically one hot summer day away from a Flint-like water crisis.
[03:02:48.041 --> 03:02:48.841]  I don't know if you guys see that.
[03:02:48.861 --> 03:02:49.662]  That's another question.
[03:02:49.942 --> 03:02:52.664]  The elites have been stealing the money, not upgrading our infrastructure.
[03:02:52.704 --> 03:02:53.804]  That's another big issue.
[03:02:54.044 --> 03:02:54.645]  Mr. Rawls?
[03:02:56.706 --> 03:03:00.568]  Yes, we have an infrastructure in our country that's crumbling.
[03:03:01.329 --> 03:03:08.571]  And it's incumbent upon individuals at this point to step up and provide for their own families.
[03:03:08.771 --> 03:03:12.031]  Every family should have a good quality water filter.
[03:03:12.192 --> 03:03:13.352]  In fact, actually two.
[03:03:13.932 --> 03:03:18.653]  You need a compact filter and you need a full-size filter like a big Berkey.
[03:03:19.573 --> 03:03:22.754]  If you don't have that for your family, you have failed your family.
[03:03:24.212 --> 03:03:28.795]  Because, obviously, you cannot depend on civic water supplies.
[03:03:29.656 --> 03:03:34.238]  And it's incumbent upon you, as the head of a family, to provide for your family.
[03:03:34.258 --> 03:03:34.739]  Absolutely.
[03:03:34.759 --> 03:03:40.623]  And from the tests that are out there, the best stuff is ProPure, the G2, also the Alexa Pure are excellent.
[03:03:40.783 --> 03:03:42.484]  There's some other excellent gravity feds out there.
[03:03:42.924 --> 03:03:44.704]  Well, I want to reiterate that people need to stay active politically.
[03:03:44.724 --> 03:03:47.265]  They need to wake up, and again, stock up, team up, train up, and
[03:04:10.285 --> 03:04:17.348]  Do support Alex's advertisers and his own store, because that keeps this message alive.
[03:04:17.368 --> 03:04:19.629]  It keeps the message out there.
[03:04:20.730 --> 03:04:29.694]  And don't fall down on your own responsibility as a head of a family to provide for your family, because we're going to see a lot of disruption in the years to come.
[03:04:30.314 --> 03:04:37.258]  So you need to think in terms of nutrition, water storage and water filters.
[03:04:38.613 --> 03:04:42.536]  And first aid, medical equipment, and self-defense.
[03:04:43.936 --> 03:04:49.760]  You've got to cover all those bases systematically for the dark days ahead.
[03:04:50.120 --> 03:04:52.382]  Even mainstream media says we're going into a global depression.
[03:04:52.422 --> 03:04:53.102]  Has it already begun?
[03:04:53.122 --> 03:04:53.983]  In 10 seconds.
[03:04:55.199 --> 03:05:05.647]  Well, yeah, I think we are on the cusp of a global depression, and at this point, it's just a matter of being physically prepared for it, because the handwriting is on the wall.
[03:05:05.727 --> 03:05:06.147]  Yes, sir.
[03:05:06.227 --> 03:05:06.868]  Thank you so much.
[03:05:06.908 --> 03:05:07.588]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:05:07.909 --> 03:05:13.733]  A leaked memo reveals how the Trump campaign really feels about the establishment.
[03:05:14.033 --> 03:05:24.424]  An internal memo leaked to the Washington Post reveals the level of disdain that Trump has for the political establishment and their talking heads in the mainstream media.
[03:05:24.504 --> 03:05:36.577]  The memo, entitled, Digging Through the Bulls**t, is written by Donald Trump's senior advisor, Barry Bennett, who said the mainstream media and Washington establishment are working together like never before.
[03:05:36.877 --> 03:05:37.077]  We're good.
[03:06:07.597 --> 03:06:12.399]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[03:08:22.713 --> 03:08:25.655]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:36.823 --> 03:08:38.324]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:38.344 --> 03:08:40.205]  I'm David Knight, your host this fourth hour.
[03:08:40.225 --> 03:08:43.528]  We're going to be joining many of our reporters on the road.
[03:08:43.548 --> 03:08:45.249]  We've got Rob Dew, Richard Reeves.
[03:08:45.269 --> 03:08:46.309]  They're both in Wisconsin.
[03:08:46.329 --> 03:08:48.771]  They're looking at the various rallies that are going on there.
[03:08:48.811 --> 03:09:01.179]  Richard Reeves has a special report about the media hypocrisy with Hillary Clinton's response to someone who questioned her on fossil fuel donations basically got in his face.
[03:09:01.219 --> 03:09:03.001]  She also had another blow up this weekend.
[03:09:03.641 --> 03:09:06.403]  That was her gaffe on abortion.
[03:09:06.983 --> 03:09:11.406]  And of course, there's been no discussion of that, really, by the mainstream media.
[03:09:11.866 --> 03:09:22.193]  It was highlighted on the Drudge Report, but the mainstream media has done very little to talk about how she stepped over the line and used terms that were inappropriate for the abortion industry.
[03:09:22.293 --> 03:09:24.414]  Terms like an unborn child.
[03:09:24.654 --> 03:09:25.535]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:09:25.695 --> 03:09:26.355]  It's a fetus.
[03:09:26.635 --> 03:09:28.416]  We've told you over and over again, Hillary.
[03:09:28.597 --> 03:09:29.537]  It is a fetus.
[03:09:29.577 --> 03:09:32.219]  You can't refer to it as an unborn child or as a person.
[03:09:33.204 --> 03:09:34.773]  And of course they had this discussion.
[03:09:35.916 --> 03:09:42.620]  Whether or not there were constitutional rights for this non-entity that is being carried, half of them, women.
[03:09:43.421 --> 03:09:44.101]  Think about that.
[03:09:44.782 --> 03:09:48.024]  And of course, she talked about it being aborted, not terminated.
[03:09:48.064 --> 03:09:53.067]  We have to remember, the correct phrases are terminated fetus.
[03:09:53.347 --> 03:09:56.669]  You know, just like the military has collateral damage.
[03:09:56.689 --> 03:09:59.751]  It's not killing innocent people, it's collateral damage.
[03:09:59.791 --> 03:10:04.715]  We don't have assassination hit list, we have a disposition matrix.
[03:10:05.555 --> 03:10:07.016]  All of these things are very important.
[03:10:07.416 --> 03:10:13.640]  The public could get very upset if they realize how we're murdering people from the time even before they're born.
[03:10:13.660 --> 03:10:17.503]  So we have to use the right terminology to keep the people in line.
[03:10:18.223 --> 03:10:25.948]  Now as you look at Wisconsin tonight, understand that tomorrow's election is really just the establishment's push-poll.
[03:10:27.031 --> 03:10:31.073]  As we pointed out before, look at the core of the GOP establishment.
[03:10:31.573 --> 03:10:32.814]  The RNC Chair, Priebus.
[03:10:33.374 --> 03:10:35.075]  The Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan.
[03:10:35.635 --> 03:10:44.820]  And of course, Scott Walker, who was their great white hope back at the very beginning, who they found out had absolutely no pulse and was a piece of wood, so he disappeared.
[03:10:45.120 --> 03:10:49.442]  And I would say that Priebus essentially is a piece of wood as well.
[03:10:49.542 --> 03:10:52.643]  This guy, I don't know what's the matter with him.
[03:10:52.663 --> 03:10:55.405]  And of course, the GOP establishment, especially Priebus,
[03:10:56.443 --> 03:11:01.048]  is really doesn't understand how this is being perceived by the general public.
[03:11:01.529 --> 03:11:04.972]  I think they're absolutely tone deaf and brain dead.
[03:11:05.413 --> 03:11:17.606]  When you're out there bragging about the fact that you're going to throw out millions of votes and you're going to change the delegates up and all this, I don't see how they think that's going to help the GOP.
[03:11:18.467 --> 03:11:37.101]  We've gone from a situation where, election after election, they have put key issues out there, campaigned on these issues, issues like, we're going to stop the Obamacare mandate, we're going to fix the borders that are totally uncontrolled, and yet, as we elect these people, they throw our issues away.
[03:11:37.281 --> 03:11:37.762]  Immediately!
[03:11:38.709 --> 03:11:41.270]  Absolutely not even pretending that they're going to do anything about it.
[03:11:41.631 --> 03:11:48.434]  Look at what our new Speaker of the House did with the Obama climate change treaty that was negotiated in Paris.
[03:11:48.494 --> 03:11:57.099]  We had people in the Senate bravely saying, senators, GOP senators saying, well, we're going to have something to say about that climate change treaty within three days.
[03:11:57.912 --> 03:12:01.476]  Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell had pushed through the omnibus bill.
[03:12:01.876 --> 03:12:02.777]  Completely funded that.
[03:12:03.077 --> 03:12:06.120]  Completely funded the Obamacare mandate, the open borders.
[03:12:06.220 --> 03:12:10.024]  Left them absolutely no leverage with Obama.
[03:12:10.465 --> 03:12:11.445]  They passed everything.
[03:12:11.526 --> 03:12:13.828]  Gave him a blank check, essentially.
[03:12:14.348 --> 03:12:16.330]  And of course, increased the debt.
[03:12:17.111 --> 03:12:18.652]  Significantly raised the debt ceiling.
[03:12:18.672 --> 03:12:19.793]  They did all of that for us.
[03:12:19.953 --> 03:12:30.078]  These are the people who are now, after they have betrayed the Republican voters, campaigning on all these issues, then immediately throwing these issues out and doing exactly the opposite.
[03:12:30.098 --> 03:12:32.600]  Just like Marco Rubio, doing exactly the opposite.
[03:12:33.120 --> 03:12:38.103]  Now they come to the point where the American voters have said, you know what, we don't trust
[03:12:38.723 --> 03:12:40.344]  These GOP politicians anymore.
[03:12:40.364 --> 03:12:43.345]  Let's get a non-politician, a true outsider.
[03:12:43.845 --> 03:12:46.606]  That's why Donald Trump is ahead in the polls.
[03:12:46.666 --> 03:12:48.287]  That's why he's ahead in the votes.
[03:12:48.647 --> 03:12:51.448]  And then they come in and say he's got absolutely nothing but a bunch of voters.
[03:12:51.848 --> 03:12:57.451]  And now they're going to not only throw out our issues, they're talking about throwing out our votes.
[03:12:58.371 --> 03:13:00.492]  That is the betrayal of this organization.
[03:13:00.512 --> 03:13:02.213]  Now let's look at what's going to be happening after this.
[03:13:02.875 --> 03:13:05.236]  Of course, Wisconsin, it is close.
[03:13:05.357 --> 03:13:06.277]  Cruz is ahead.
[03:13:07.058 --> 03:13:11.500]  But after this, it's not going to be very competitive for Mr. Cruz.
[03:13:11.540 --> 03:13:13.262]  This is a recent poll that's come out.
[03:13:13.302 --> 03:13:17.164]  They're looking at Ted Cruz and Wisconsin ahead of Trump 43-37.
[03:13:17.224 --> 03:13:23.028]  However, after this, it moves to New York and it moves to Pennsylvania.
[03:13:23.068 --> 03:13:23.828]  How's that looking?
[03:13:23.868 --> 03:13:26.170]  Well, not so good for Cruz and Kasich.
[03:13:26.730 --> 03:13:28.671]  In New York, Trump has a 31% lead.
[03:13:28.911 --> 03:13:31.412]  Not 31%, a 31% lead over Cruz and Kasich.
[03:13:31.472 --> 03:13:33.313]  He's at 52%, Cruz is at 21%, Kasich is at 20% in New York.
[03:13:42.034 --> 03:13:46.817]  I guess Cruz wishes he hadn't made that comment about he doesn't share New York values.
[03:13:47.498 --> 03:13:48.739]  He doesn't value New Yorkers.
[03:13:49.239 --> 03:13:52.081]  Okay, then in Pennsylvania it doesn't look any better for him, okay?
[03:13:52.741 --> 03:13:56.304]  You've got Trump at 47, Cruz and Kasich are at 29 and 22.
[03:13:57.084 --> 03:13:57.745]  Not much better.
[03:13:58.185 --> 03:14:03.048]  And of course, most of these that are coming up are winner-take-all primaries.
[03:14:03.468 --> 03:14:04.789]  So it doesn't look very good for them.
[03:14:04.809 --> 03:14:07.911]  There's a lot of primaries that are going to be moving into the Northeast.
[03:14:08.392 --> 03:14:10.293]  It is not friendly territory for Ted Cruz.
[03:14:10.313 --> 03:14:11.454]  Of course, he was telling everybody
[03:14:12.054 --> 03:14:16.298]  His best areas were going to be in the South, and yet he lost the popular vote in the South.
[03:14:16.318 --> 03:14:20.082]  He's stealing the delegates, but he lost the popular vote in the South.
[03:14:20.122 --> 03:14:25.568]  And of course, those delegates are going to be there for the first round, no matter what Ted Cruz does.
[03:14:25.748 --> 03:14:28.791]  I guess they could change the rules on that as well.
[03:14:29.132 --> 03:14:29.492]  Why not?
[03:14:29.512 --> 03:14:33.016]  You know, everything is up for grabs with this corrupt bunch of lawyers.
[03:14:34.127 --> 03:14:36.668]  But now we also have a new poll out of California.
[03:14:36.688 --> 03:14:39.849]  Now California is the very last day of the primaries.
[03:14:39.929 --> 03:14:43.370]  It is the very last primary and it is a huge primary.
[03:14:43.710 --> 03:14:45.470]  It has the most number of delegates.
[03:14:46.270 --> 03:14:51.432]  Texas is second and then a close third to Texas are the superdelegates of the GOP.
[03:14:52.672 --> 03:14:57.836]  Uh, but California has, I think it was about 170, 275, something like that.
[03:14:58.337 --> 03:15:00.398]  Donald Trump leads the Republican field in California.
[03:15:00.438 --> 03:15:04.441]  It's now two months out before this last primary in California.
[03:15:05.022 --> 03:15:09.465]  Trump leads at 37%, Cruz is behind at 30, and Kasich is at 12.
[03:15:10.046 --> 03:15:12.748]  It's not looking too good for John Kasich, the man who needs
[03:15:13.348 --> 03:15:20.491]  More than 100% of the delegates in order to win the nomination up front, honestly and squarely.
[03:15:20.511 --> 03:15:27.515]  Of course it's not looking too good for Ted Cruz either when he needs to have 90% of the delegates coming up.
[03:15:28.345 --> 03:15:30.787]  They say that Cruz gains on Trump and makes it a closer race.
[03:15:30.807 --> 03:15:39.575]  When you look at those that are most likely to vote in the June 7th primary in California, Trump and Cruz are then neck and neck, earning 36 and 35 percent support, respectively.
[03:15:39.595 --> 03:15:42.138]  And remember, this is a closed primary.
[03:15:42.178 --> 03:15:50.906]  If you want to vote in that primary, and you are an Independent or a Democrat, you need to change your registration before the primary date.
[03:15:52.133 --> 03:15:56.815]  Very important for those people in California to understand that they need to register as Republican.
[03:15:56.855 --> 03:15:57.455]  They can't walk in.
[03:15:57.495 --> 03:15:58.436]  It's not an open primary.
[03:15:58.776 --> 03:16:03.678]  Some of these states you can walk in and they ask you, do you want a Democrat ballot or do you want a Republican ballot?
[03:16:03.818 --> 03:16:11.901]  In some of these states, however, like California, you have to be registered with the party by a date certain before the primary begins.
[03:16:11.941 --> 03:16:13.622]  And they're not going to waive those rules for you.
[03:16:14.443 --> 03:16:18.867]  Okay, they'll waive the rules for John Kasich to get on the ballot in Pennsylvania.
[03:16:19.628 --> 03:16:25.172]  He missed the deadline, he missed the total number of people that he needed, signatures he needed to get on the ballot.
[03:16:25.452 --> 03:16:29.536]  This is something that's critical to his path, presumably.
[03:16:29.816 --> 03:16:30.837]  That's what he's been telling everybody.
[03:16:30.877 --> 03:16:34.861]  I'm doing really well in Pennsylvania, and yet he couldn't be bothered.
[03:16:35.612 --> 03:16:46.901]  To get 2,000 verified signatures to legally get on the ballot in Pennsylvania so they just waived the requirements for him because, you know, he's an insider with the GOP.
[03:16:47.442 --> 03:16:51.765]  They don't waive the requirements for anybody who's an independent, anybody who's a third-party candidate.
[03:16:51.805 --> 03:16:52.906]  I can guarantee you that.
[03:16:53.147 --> 03:16:55.248]  I've seen just the opposite happen.
[03:16:55.669 --> 03:17:00.853]  I've seen them take it to the nth degree to keep people they don't want off the ballot.
[03:17:00.913 --> 03:17:06.696]  And I've seen them waive the rules just like they waived the rules for Hillary and Bernie in Washington D.C.
[03:17:06.776 --> 03:17:12.960]  when the Democrat Party failed to turn in their signatures and their information to get on the ballot.
[03:17:13.874 --> 03:17:15.715]  In Washington, D.C., they missed their deadline.
[03:17:16.176 --> 03:17:24.582]  They did absolutely nothing about it, except one person tried to keep Bernie Sanders off the ballot, and they said, no, no, no, we'll just waive that and keep both of them on.
[03:17:25.282 --> 03:17:31.947]  I want to also point out to you, of course, there's some things we're going to be covering tonight on the Nightly News at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:17:32.027 --> 03:17:32.327]  Eastern.
[03:17:32.908 --> 03:17:34.329]  We're going to be talking about
[03:17:35.441 --> 03:17:57.521]  The new Supreme Court decision in Pennsylvania, the state Supreme Court in Pennsylvania has said that they're going to weigh the requirements and they're going to let Ted Cruz be on the ballot there, that he is eligible to run for president even though he's born in Canada and he only had one parent who was an American citizen and he didn't revoke his Canadian citizenship until the time he started to run for president.
[03:17:57.561 --> 03:17:57.962]  No problem.
[03:17:58.612 --> 03:18:00.013]  We're just going to let that go.
[03:18:00.033 --> 03:18:02.736]  So we're going to do a report on that tonight on the nightly news.
[03:18:02.756 --> 03:18:19.951]  We're going to talk about the fact that you may not have realized this, but between 2003 and 2008, there were no less, during that five-year period, there was no less than eight attempts within Congress to try to strike the term natural-born citizen out of the constitutional language.
[03:18:20.751 --> 03:18:21.451]  Or to redefine it.
[03:18:21.812 --> 03:18:25.454]  Or to say that, well, we're not going to say anything about where you were born.
[03:18:25.474 --> 03:18:26.875]  We don't really care where you were born.
[03:18:26.895 --> 03:18:31.258]  We don't care if you have a connection to this country, if your parents were American citizens.
[03:18:31.718 --> 03:18:32.839]  We're going to waive that.
[03:18:32.939 --> 03:18:36.161]  And there's a reason that the founders put that in.
[03:18:36.321 --> 03:18:37.442]  There was a logic for that.
[03:18:37.482 --> 03:18:39.243]  There was a purpose for that requirement.
[03:18:39.323 --> 03:18:41.164]  And of course we know what that requirement means.
[03:18:41.544 --> 03:18:47.328]  We can go back and we can find what the original language said, just as we know what the original language meant with militia.
[03:18:48.425 --> 03:18:53.347]  And of course they'd like to play with the definition of terms to try to get what they want.
[03:18:54.287 --> 03:19:06.432]  But they've tried eight times to throw that out and say, well, we're just going to let people who have been here, whether or not, regardless of where they were born, if they lived in America and they were a citizen for 35 years, we're going to let them run for president.
[03:19:07.092 --> 03:19:09.513]  Or if they were here for 20 years or whatever.
[03:19:09.653 --> 03:19:11.373]  They did that multiple times.
[03:19:11.453 --> 03:19:12.854]  It was a bipartisan effort.
[03:19:13.434 --> 03:19:17.377]  Some of these eight attempts to remove natural-born citizens were done by Republicans.
[03:19:17.857 --> 03:19:19.319]  Some were done by Democrats.
[03:19:19.499 --> 03:19:22.161]  And this was before Obama became president.
[03:19:22.201 --> 03:19:33.909]  And it's absolutely amazing to me that so many people who had an issue with Barack Obama have no issue with Ted Cruz's not being a natural-born citizen.
[03:19:34.930 --> 03:19:37.232]  Now, according to the official story, if we believe it,
[03:19:39.105 --> 03:19:44.649]  Obama had an American parent, one American parent, and was born on American soil.
[03:19:45.250 --> 03:19:48.912]  Ted Cruz wasn't even born on American soil, according to this official story.
[03:19:49.573 --> 03:19:53.156]  But we give him a pass because he's part of the GOP establishment.
[03:19:53.756 --> 03:19:56.819]  But they're going to betray him at a brokered convention.
[03:19:56.859 --> 03:20:01.663]  They're already talking about how they're going to throw Ted Cruz out if you let them get away with this.
[03:20:01.703 --> 03:20:02.123]  Stay with us.
[03:20:02.383 --> 03:20:04.205]  We'll be right back with the reporters on the road.
[03:20:11.068 --> 03:20:14.012]  December 7th, 1941.
[03:20:14.493 --> 03:20:17.878]  A date which will live in infamy.
[03:20:18.218 --> 03:20:22.924]  75 years ago, America suffered one of the worst moments in American history.
[03:20:23.425 --> 03:20:25.107]  The attack on Pearl Harbor.
[03:20:25.828 --> 03:20:36.834]  Now you can remember December 7th, 1941 with the purchase of the first ever 75th Anniversary Pearl Harbor Legal Tender Solid Gold Coin from the U.S.

[03:21:10.242 --> 03:21:17.287]  In these days of terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or even a future collapse, you need to be medically prepared to keep your family safe.

[03:21:36.000 --> 03:21:37.041]  You'll be glad you did.
[03:21:37.381 --> 03:21:44.944]  If you want to raise the next generation of patriot leaders, take a look at Freedom Project Academy, a Judeo-Christian online school for kindergarten through high school.
[03:21:45.244 --> 03:21:47.745]  No common core teaching methods or high-stakes testing.
[03:21:47.965 --> 03:21:53.948]  Freedom Project Academy is government-free, doesn't accept any government funding, and is a fully accredited private school.
[03:21:54.328 --> 03:21:57.449]  All classes are taught live online with real teachers across the country.
[03:21:57.649 --> 03:22:00.891]  Open enrollment runs March through July, but classes fill up quickly.

[03:22:04.032 --> 03:22:06.053]  That's FPEUSA.org.
[03:22:10.396 --> 03:22:16.860]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a SelectQuote agent with a true story of how SelectQuote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[03:22:17.801 --> 03:22:20.583]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:22:21.423 --> 03:22:25.106]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:22:25.766 --> 03:22:27.006]  I said, let me see.
[03:22:27.587 --> 03:22:38.170]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:22:38.650 --> 03:22:49.773]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[03:22:50.734 --> 03:22:51.415]  How about you?
[03:22:51.735 --> 03:22:53.037]  For your free quote, call 1-800-654-1632.
[03:22:53.057 --> 03:22:53.358]  That's 1-800-654-1632.
[03:22:53.378 --> 03:22:53.438]  1-800-654-1632.
[03:22:53.498 --> 03:22:54.479]  Or go to selectquote.com.
[03:22:54.499 --> 03:22:54.860]  We shop.
[03:22:54.880 --> 03:22:55.140]  You save.
[03:23:07.376 --> 03:23:11.098]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[03:23:11.558 --> 03:23:17.442]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[03:23:17.762 --> 03:23:18.922]  How is this even possible?
[03:23:19.503 --> 03:23:26.827]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[03:23:27.067 --> 03:23:34.811]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[03:23:35.011 --> 03:23:38.894]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[03:23:39.375 --> 03:23:47.762]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[03:23:48.142 --> 03:23:49.584]  But you must act fast.
[03:23:49.724 --> 03:23:54.268]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard, our supply is extremely limited right now.
[03:23:54.548 --> 03:23:58.631]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[03:23:58.691 --> 03:23:59.972]  That's Greens75.com.
[03:24:00.492 --> 03:24:00.832]  Greens75.com.
[03:24:24.173 --> 03:24:25.394]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:25.414 --> 03:24:27.316]  I'm David Knight, your host on this fourth hour.
[03:24:27.356 --> 03:24:29.399]  We're going to be going to our reporters in Wisconsin.
[03:24:29.439 --> 03:24:31.921]  We've got Rob Dew, Richard Reeves lined up to talk to us.
[03:24:31.941 --> 03:24:40.831]  We also have Joe Biggs coming up, and of course he's been on the East Coast looking at the much-discussed Democracy Spring.
[03:24:41.371 --> 03:24:42.733]  Turns out it was a total flop.
[03:25:00.313 --> 03:25:03.956]  In just a moment, before we do, I want to let you know about the new products that we've got.
[03:25:03.976 --> 03:25:07.800]  Of course, this was just introduced, I think it was last week, our Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:25:07.820 --> 03:25:13.464]  Now this is a drink mix that has a, it's a great tasting multivitamin formula.
[03:25:13.624 --> 03:25:16.007]  You mix this in with some water and drink it.
[03:25:16.407 --> 03:25:18.389]  So it's in a very concentrated form.
[03:25:18.829 --> 03:25:20.150]  This is a great product.
[03:25:20.190 --> 03:25:27.697]  The best part is, all the ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant derived or the highest quality lab standard.
[03:25:28.337 --> 03:25:30.898]  Now, these are some of the things that it's rich in.
[03:25:30.938 --> 03:25:32.578]  It's got a lot of ingredients in it.
[03:25:32.819 --> 03:25:34.039]  This is Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:25:34.059 --> 03:25:35.760]  You can find it at Infowarslife.com.
[03:25:35.800 --> 03:25:45.323]  It's got Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Zinc, Magnesium, Selenium, L-Glutamine, Alpha-Lipoic Acid, Folic Acid, Calcium, and many other ingredients.
[03:25:45.383 --> 03:25:47.864]  Take a look at all the vitamin ingredients.
[03:25:47.884 --> 03:25:48.604]  There's a great
[03:25:49.344 --> 03:25:54.948]  Multivitamin base for your nutrients, for your supplements that you're going to take out there.
[03:25:55.208 --> 03:25:58.870]  And it is in a great tasting form, very powerful, very affordable.
[03:25:59.191 --> 03:26:01.412]  That is the Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:26:01.572 --> 03:26:02.773]  Take a look at it before we run out.
[03:26:02.813 --> 03:26:04.674]  This is our first limited run.
[03:26:05.115 --> 03:26:07.176]  We have it now at Infowarslife.com.

[03:26:35.164 --> 03:26:38.565]  I want to go now to our reporters in Wisconsin.
[03:26:38.585 --> 03:26:40.626]  I think Rob Dew, we've got him on first.
[03:26:40.666 --> 03:26:42.206]  He's in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
[03:26:42.266 --> 03:26:42.846]  Rob, are you there?
[03:26:43.795 --> 03:26:44.455]  Yes, I'm here.
[03:26:44.515 --> 03:26:49.999]  We're in southern Milwaukee right now in our hotel, just uploading more videos.
[03:26:50.039 --> 03:27:05.808]  We shot a lot of video footage yesterday, including a kind of a two-part series that we put on the Alex Jones Channel, where these, after all the Trump supporters went inside, some militant black, their group is called F Your Flag, hashtag F Your Flag.
[03:27:05.828 --> 03:27:11.512]  They came over, brought an American flag, set it in front on the grass, started spitting on it and stomping on it.
[03:27:12.092 --> 03:27:16.814]  And then they saw me as an InfoWars reporter, and they wanted to talk to me.
[03:27:18.435 --> 03:27:20.795]  They were mad that we had Professor Griff on the show.
[03:27:21.996 --> 03:27:25.537]  They called names to some of the other people we've had on the show, asked them about Minister Farrakhan.
[03:27:25.577 --> 03:27:28.218]  They said, well, I'm not a nation of Islam, so I don't care.
[03:27:28.598 --> 03:27:32.020]  Did they want to talk to you, or did they want to throw you on the ground and spit on you like the flag?
[03:27:33.156 --> 03:27:37.238]  No, I actually did about an 11-minute interview that people can watch and see for themselves.
[03:27:37.618 --> 03:27:49.864]  You know, the one thing I didn't have in my back pocket was the article by, who, Paul Joseph Watson came out May 5th of 2015, black crime facts that the white liberal media daren't talk about.
[03:27:50.465 --> 03:27:54.166]  And one of which, because I asked him about black-on-black crime and why it's so high.
[03:27:55.527 --> 03:27:57.608]  And he said, well, that's just because blacks are around each other.
[03:27:58.485 --> 03:28:10.974]  And what I didn't have was the fact, despite being outnumbered by whites 5 to 1, blacks commit 8 times more crimes against whites than vice versa according to FBI statistics from 2007.
[03:28:11.034 --> 03:28:15.357]  The black male is 40 times as likely to assault a white person as in reverse.
[03:28:18.086 --> 03:28:20.587]  You know, his first thing is, well, it's just because we're around each other.
[03:28:20.607 --> 03:28:24.929]  I mean, that's not much of a defense to say that.
[03:28:24.969 --> 03:28:26.450]  I'm going to get the guy.
[03:28:26.730 --> 03:28:29.111]  I'm a criminal, so I'm going to hit the person closest to me.
[03:28:29.151 --> 03:28:31.112]  I mean, that's not much of a defense, is it?
[03:28:32.332 --> 03:28:32.792]  I agree.
[03:28:32.972 --> 03:28:33.413]  It's not.
[03:28:33.633 --> 03:28:39.856]  And a couple of veterans, they were trying to grab the flag from them off the ground.
[03:28:41.519 --> 03:28:45.643]  You know, the police actually had to come in and break it up before it got worse.
[03:28:45.723 --> 03:28:50.288]  But then before the Trump rally got out, they picked up their flag and they walked off.
[03:28:50.909 --> 03:29:01.740]  They were done after, you know, because they knew if a bunch of veterans came out, like the veterans I talked to before they went in, I talked to a bunch of veterans and
[03:29:02.199 --> 03:29:04.840]  You know, if those guys would have came out, I think it would have been a different story.
[03:29:04.860 --> 03:29:05.381]  Yeah.
[03:29:05.441 --> 03:29:13.365]  And, you know, not that I'm calling for violence in any way, but, you know, when you go there with that kind of provocative action, you will get a reaction you may not like.
[03:29:13.665 --> 03:29:14.045]  That's right.
[03:29:14.185 --> 03:29:14.545]  That's right.
[03:29:14.885 --> 03:29:19.188]  It's not simply about... When I cover this in Washington, D.C.
[03:29:20.228 --> 03:29:22.009]  They weren't there to exercise their free speech.
[03:29:22.049 --> 03:29:25.432]  They're standing there chanting three words repetitively.
[03:29:25.812 --> 03:29:35.400]  And I tell you, the police that were separating them from the crowd going into that event, if they were not Trump supporters by the end of that, nothing would convert them.
[03:29:35.440 --> 03:29:38.522]  Because it drives people away from your point of view.
[03:29:38.542 --> 03:29:39.983]  You're not trying to persuade anybody.
[03:29:40.003 --> 03:29:42.165]  You're simply trying to shut down free speech.
[03:29:42.185 --> 03:29:43.466]  You're trying to annoy people.
[03:29:43.706 --> 03:29:45.908]  It's not anything that's persuasive at all.
[03:29:46.428 --> 03:29:50.193]  I don't understand why they think this is going to be a very effective tactic.
[03:29:50.233 --> 03:29:53.978]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back with our reporters Rob Dew, Richard Reeves in Wisconsin.
[03:29:57.223 --> 03:30:00.227]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:30:01.148 --> 03:30:03.852]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:07.967 --> 03:30:13.832]  A leaked memo reveals how the Trump campaign really feels about the establishment.
[03:30:14.112 --> 03:30:24.480]  An internal memo leaked to the Washington Post reveals the level of disdain that Trump has for the political establishment and their talking heads in the mainstream media.
[03:30:24.560 --> 03:30:36.649]  The memo, entitled, Digging Through the Bulls**t, is written by Donald Trump's senior advisor, Barry Bennett, who said the mainstream media and Washington establishment are working together like never before.
[03:30:36.889 --> 03:30:37.369]  We're good.
[03:30:55.804 --> 03:31:03.739]  Another pathetic display by these so-called experts who line their pockets at the expense of our candidates and causes.
[03:31:04.140 --> 03:31:06.204]  You can learn more right now at Infowars.com
[03:31:07.839 --> 03:31:08.440]  Uh, yeah, Alex.
[03:31:08.480 --> 03:31:14.244]  First of all, I want to say, Secret 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[03:31:14.304 --> 03:31:15.204]  I use them all.
[03:31:15.264 --> 03:31:16.205]  They're phenomenal.
[03:31:16.265 --> 03:31:16.746]  They work.
[03:31:17.006 --> 03:31:17.746]  Buy them, folks.
[03:31:17.846 --> 03:31:18.207]  Thank you, brother.
[03:31:18.227 --> 03:31:20.228]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[03:31:20.248 --> 03:31:26.272]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[03:31:26.473 --> 03:31:28.394]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[03:31:28.454 --> 03:31:33.878]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[03:31:34.198 --> 03:31:34.999]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[03:31:35.019 --> 03:31:38.582]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, AcuFX, uh, nascent iodine.
[03:31:38.782 --> 03:31:39.683]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:31:39.703 --> 03:31:40.584]  Have they worked for you?
[03:31:40.764 --> 03:31:43.286]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[03:31:43.606 --> 03:31:44.667]  What products are you taking?
[03:31:44.948 --> 03:31:52.915]  Everything from, uh, Super Male to, uh, Brain Force to Winter Sun, uh, X2, even got a little, uh, DNA Force.
[03:31:52.995 --> 03:31:56.458]  So, and I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.

[03:32:06.126 --> 03:32:11.451]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:11.791 --> 03:32:19.018]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable grape-tasting multivitamin formula available.

[03:32:30.682 --> 03:32:38.204]  In the history of Infowarslife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[03:32:38.504 --> 03:32:47.850]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[03:32:48.150 --> 03:32:52.333]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.

[03:32:59.657 --> 03:33:00.798]  That means it's clean.
[03:33:01.138 --> 03:33:02.219]  That means it's pure.

[03:33:17.344 --> 03:33:22.450]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:33:26.388 --> 03:33:27.769]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:27.809 --> 03:33:31.491]  This fourth hour we've got Rob Dew and Richard Reeves, our reporters in Wisconsin.
[03:33:31.511 --> 03:33:32.452]  We were just talking to Rob Dew.
[03:33:32.472 --> 03:33:33.712]  We're going to go back to them in just a moment.
[03:33:33.732 --> 03:33:40.437]  And then we're going to talk to Joe Biggs, our reporter who is on the East Coast in Pennsylvania, covering the Democracy Spring.
[03:33:40.457 --> 03:33:48.802]  But he also got some footage of the Amtrak train derailment, and he had an interview there with the father of one of the bin Laden SEAL teams.
[03:33:48.822 --> 03:33:51.803]  So we're going to be talking to Joe Biggs after our reporters in Wisconsin.
[03:33:51.823 --> 03:33:52.404]  Let's go back to
[03:33:53.024 --> 03:33:55.025]  Rob Dew and Richard Reeves in Wisconsin.
[03:33:55.085 --> 03:33:59.166]  Rob, tell us about this video that you got, the one lonely Trump protester.
[03:34:00.287 --> 03:34:00.987]  Yeah, that's correct.
[03:34:01.047 --> 03:34:02.367]  It's got about 30,000 views.
[03:34:02.647 --> 03:34:05.608]  Mainstream local media showcases single Trump supporter.
[03:34:06.349 --> 03:34:11.570]  And it happened after the rally in Wausau, which is the central part of Wisconsin.
[03:34:12.331 --> 03:34:15.432]  And when we pulled up, we saw three people protesting with signs.
[03:34:16.152 --> 03:34:22.474]  And we go inside and there's at least a thousand people just listening to Trump that didn't even get into the rally.
[03:34:23.064 --> 03:34:24.845]  Well, then the rally ends.
[03:34:24.905 --> 03:34:25.725]  People start pouring out.
[03:34:25.745 --> 03:34:27.326]  We're interviewing people, talking to them.
[03:34:27.606 --> 03:34:28.606]  Did you see any protesters?
[03:34:28.666 --> 03:34:29.427]  Nah, I haven't seen any.
[03:34:29.447 --> 03:34:30.747]  I haven't seen any protesters anywhere.
[03:34:31.387 --> 03:34:33.468]  Have you ever seen this many people at this place before?
[03:34:33.548 --> 03:34:34.129]  No, never.
[03:34:34.169 --> 03:34:36.470]  The line extended all the way around this giant mall.
[03:34:37.230 --> 03:34:42.312]  And then, as we're leaving, we're driving by and the local media has a shot set up.
[03:34:43.044 --> 03:34:44.625]  And yeah, you can see the photo right there.
[03:34:45.025 --> 03:34:49.287]  That's the mainstream media on the other side of that tree with their shot set up.
[03:34:49.347 --> 03:34:52.028]  And I even go to their new shot in the video.
[03:34:52.068 --> 03:34:56.029]  You can go see their new shot and they have it set up where that one protester is there.
[03:34:56.389 --> 03:34:57.970]  So they want to show that.
[03:34:58.150 --> 03:35:04.073]  And then there was an article from some local newspaper.
[03:35:04.093 --> 03:35:06.053]  They kind of had the USA Today outline.
[03:35:06.073 --> 03:35:07.554]  So I think they're affiliated with USA Today.
[03:35:08.780 --> 03:35:10.322]  And they have all their photos set up.
[03:35:10.863 --> 03:35:13.627]  Hardly any of them show Trump supporters.
[03:35:13.968 --> 03:35:16.792]  There might be one or two that they show and then it shows like an empty
[03:35:19.701 --> 03:35:19.841]  Oh yeah.
[03:35:38.849 --> 03:35:48.812]  No, there was a rally just recently, Rob, where they had Heidi Cruz and Carly Fiorina and they couldn't get more than 50 people to show up to listen to the two of them.
[03:35:49.152 --> 03:35:52.073]  And that's typically what you see in these kind of political events.
[03:35:52.153 --> 03:35:54.214]  I've covered a lot of these at the state and local level.
[03:35:54.734 --> 03:35:56.554]  Even races that are at the top of the ticket.
[03:35:56.634 --> 03:35:57.535]  Races for Senate.
[03:35:57.615 --> 03:35:59.215]  Races for Governor.
[03:35:59.415 --> 03:36:01.095]  And even presidential races.
[03:36:01.155 --> 03:36:03.176]  You don't get that many people to show up.
[03:36:03.236 --> 03:36:06.457]  It's amazing to see thousands of people show up.
[03:36:06.517 --> 03:36:07.817]  And we've only seen that a few times.
[03:36:07.837 --> 03:36:08.737]  We saw that for Obama.
[03:36:08.757 --> 03:36:09.797]  We saw it for Ron Paul.
[03:36:10.177 --> 03:36:11.898]  We see it for Trump.
[03:36:11.918 --> 03:36:13.198]  There's our shot there.
[03:36:13.398 --> 03:36:14.118]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:36:14.138 --> 03:36:16.279]  And that's an hour after we got there.
[03:36:16.319 --> 03:36:17.979]  That was the whole hour after we got there.
[03:36:17.999 --> 03:36:19.720]  I mean, after the event started.
[03:36:19.760 --> 03:36:20.540]  We got there at 4.
[03:36:20.620 --> 03:36:21.320]  The event started at 3.
[03:36:22.140 --> 03:36:25.081]  And there were still thousands of people hanging out listening to Trump.
[03:36:26.401 --> 03:36:27.701]  And they weren't even in the arena.
[03:36:27.741 --> 03:36:29.382]  They were just listening in the hallway.
[03:36:30.282 --> 03:36:32.262]  We saw the same thing in Janesville.
[03:36:32.362 --> 03:36:34.102]  I saw the same thing in Washington, D.C.
[03:36:34.503 --> 03:36:36.803]  They had the Verizon Center there where AIPAC was going on.
[03:36:36.823 --> 03:36:38.103]  Now that was not a Trump rally.
[03:36:39.063 --> 03:36:41.164]  There was not a Trump rally.
[03:36:41.584 --> 03:36:45.825]  It was an AIPAC convention that he and other presidential candidates were speaking at.
[03:36:46.525 --> 03:36:51.506]  But of course, the drive-by media goes up and says, look at this, there's thousands of protesters.
[03:36:51.526 --> 03:36:53.087]  There were not thousands of protesters.
[03:36:53.147 --> 03:36:54.327]  There were maybe 50.
[03:36:55.587 --> 03:36:59.828]  And they were surrounded by the police, so it was very easy to identify who they were if you actually looked at it.
[03:36:59.868 --> 03:37:03.349]  There was a crowd of 15,000 people going into that arena.
[03:37:03.749 --> 03:37:11.271]  And they were being snaked back and forth in a very long line, like you see people being controlled going into a ride at Disney World, for example.
[03:37:11.291 --> 03:37:12.972]  Yeah, and yesterday at Nathan Hale High School,
[03:37:39.255 --> 03:37:43.067]  During the show, I was showing Alex, you know, look, here's all the people lined up for Trump.
[03:37:43.328 --> 03:37:45.575]  You turn around, mainstream media cameras.
[03:37:46.371 --> 03:37:50.415]  All of the group, and by that time it was a very small group of protesters, probably 25.
[03:37:51.155 --> 03:37:53.277]  And I'm being generous by saying 25.
[03:37:54.138 --> 03:37:58.982]  Now by the end there were more protesters, especially when people were coming out, they were screaming at them and stuff like that.
[03:38:00.243 --> 03:38:03.686]  And then you had the militant blacks coming in, doing their protest.
[03:38:04.027 --> 03:38:09.672]  So people are taking advantage of this opportunity where Trump's going to speak to try to get whatever their message is out.
[03:38:10.152 --> 03:38:11.393]  And it's not a very clear message.
[03:38:11.693 --> 03:38:13.395]  I talked to some young kids who are in high school.
[03:38:13.715 --> 03:38:15.796]  I had no idea the IRS carries guns.
[03:38:15.956 --> 03:38:16.676]  They didn't believe me.
[03:38:17.117 --> 03:38:20.358]  And I said, I've interviewed a gun-carrying IRS agent, kids.
[03:38:20.778 --> 03:38:21.038]  Okay?
[03:38:21.218 --> 03:38:21.639]  And guess what?
[03:38:21.859 --> 03:38:23.419]  They kill people if you don't pay taxes.
[03:38:23.479 --> 03:38:24.000]  Go look it up.
[03:38:24.100 --> 03:38:24.660]  Go look it up.
[03:38:24.840 --> 03:38:25.400]  Don't believe me?
[03:38:25.480 --> 03:38:26.501]  Please don't believe me.
[03:38:27.741 --> 03:38:28.342]  I'm surprised.
[03:38:28.402 --> 03:38:37.706]  You've got the BLM that kills people if you're going to a meeting to explain to people how to have different kind of policies to manage the lands that they claim that they own.
[03:38:38.126 --> 03:38:39.587]  Well, that's one kind of media hypocrisy.
[03:38:39.607 --> 03:38:40.867]  I want to talk to Richard Reeves.
[03:38:40.887 --> 03:38:50.872]  He's got a different kind of media hypocrisy, basically giving Hillary Clinton a pass when she engages somebody at a rally that asks her a hostile question.
[03:38:50.912 --> 03:38:51.893]  Richard, tell us about that.
[03:38:53.333 --> 03:38:55.854]  Well, I think many people have probably seen that video already.
[03:38:55.874 --> 03:39:00.677]  Hopefully you've got it there where you can show it, where Hillary really blew up at a little Greenpeace activist.
[03:39:01.537 --> 03:39:03.498]  I guess it was Thursday or Friday of last week.
[03:39:04.128 --> 03:39:14.612]  And Hillary got up in this young lady's face, pointing a finger at her, really angry, saying, I'm tired of the Bernie Sanders people lying about the fossil fuel money, et cetera.
[03:39:15.272 --> 03:39:24.655]  And had that been Donald Trump having an episode like that, getting up in a young girl's grill and wagging a finger and getting angry like that.
[03:39:25.103 --> 03:39:28.225]  We'd probably hear that out of the mainstream media for a month.
[03:39:28.325 --> 03:39:30.186]  Yeah, hang on Richard, let's play that clip.
[03:39:30.206 --> 03:39:31.006]  They've got that cued up.
[03:39:31.046 --> 03:39:34.408]  Let's play that clip so people are watching this and people on the radio can hear that.
[03:39:52.386 --> 03:39:53.807]  Well, she really got angry.
[03:39:53.827 --> 03:39:55.227]  I had not seen that clip before.
[03:39:55.287 --> 03:39:56.708]  And of course, people are watching that.
[03:39:57.068 --> 03:39:57.908]  People who aren't watching that.
[03:39:58.548 --> 03:40:02.730]  She gets this frown on her face and puts her finger right in that young lady's face.
[03:40:02.850 --> 03:40:09.393]  So yeah, if Trump had done that, you can bet that would have been the leading news everywhere.
[03:40:09.413 --> 03:40:12.594]  But of course, Richard, they gave her a pass this weekend, too.
[03:40:13.234 --> 03:40:22.940]  When she stuck her foot in it, as far as the abortion people are concerned, she was asked if an unborn child had constitutional rights, and she continued on with that.
[03:40:22.980 --> 03:40:26.062]  She didn't correct him and say, it's not a child, it's a fetus!
[03:40:26.802 --> 03:40:31.965]  And so they let that go, and of course that is anathema to the abortionists.
[03:40:31.985 --> 03:40:42.652]  They don't want the child referred to as a child, they don't refer to it as a person, and yet she was using that terminology, and even talking about abortion and that connection, when it's supposed to be terminating a fetus.
[03:40:42.992 --> 03:40:44.413]  Understand that it's terminating a fetus.
[03:40:45.434 --> 03:40:47.176]  Right, and that's exactly what I was going to say.
[03:40:47.236 --> 03:40:48.617]  She did use that terminology.
[03:40:48.657 --> 03:40:57.025]  It was just yesterday on one of the Talking Heads Sunday programs when she said that basically an unborn person does not have constitutional rights.
[03:40:57.065 --> 03:41:00.228]  That's not the exact verbiage, but basically that was the question.
[03:41:00.869 --> 03:41:05.173]  Does an unborn child have constitutional rights was the question, and she answered it
[03:41:06.079 --> 03:41:09.042]  Basically, no, an unborn person does not have those rights.
[03:41:09.162 --> 03:41:11.525]  And that's the whole crux of it, is personhood.
[03:41:11.585 --> 03:41:17.112]  That's what they have said about that, and we're going to break that down in detail tonight because she goes through all the talking points.
[03:41:17.393 --> 03:41:21.438]  She talks about, well, we've modified the Constitution with the Supreme Court.
[03:41:21.518 --> 03:41:23.660]  It's now the law of the land, and it's like baloney.
[03:41:24.441 --> 03:41:27.244]  Look at the process for modifying the Constitution.
[03:41:27.264 --> 03:41:29.206]  There's nothing about Supreme Court decisions.
[03:41:29.246 --> 03:41:32.970]  And we've had the Supreme Court come in and say, hey, you've got to turn back runaway slaves.
[03:41:33.010 --> 03:41:36.274]  You don't have First Amendment rights if you have a movie.
[03:41:36.414 --> 03:41:41.419]  We've had all kinds of nonsense come out of the Supreme Court that has subsequently been reversed.
[03:41:42.040 --> 03:41:44.042]  It is not amending the Constitution.
[03:41:44.142 --> 03:41:45.284]  They don't write law.
[03:41:45.324 --> 03:41:48.107]  They're supposed to apply the law and judge the law.
[03:41:48.147 --> 03:41:49.709]  They aren't supposed to write it.
[03:41:49.729 --> 03:41:53.873]  They're not supposed to amend the Constitution, but we treat it that way.
[03:41:53.933 --> 03:41:58.839]  We need to expose that language because it's very important how they use the language, just as important
[03:41:59.259 --> 03:42:07.110]  As using terms like child and person to say that it is now the law of the land, that it is now the constitutional process.
[03:42:07.170 --> 03:42:08.271]  It's very important to expose that.
[03:42:08.531 --> 03:42:09.733]  Well thank you Richard and Rob.
[03:42:09.813 --> 03:42:12.036]  Before we run out of time, I want to get to Joe Biggs.
[03:42:12.056 --> 03:42:14.619]  He's waiting for us in Pennsylvania.
[03:42:14.940 --> 03:42:17.283]  We'll be checking back in with you guys in Wisconsin.
[03:42:18.629 --> 03:42:18.869]  Thanks.
[03:42:19.350 --> 03:42:22.612]  Let's go to Joe Biggs now in Philadelphia.
[03:42:22.672 --> 03:42:23.953]  Actually, somewhere in Pennsylvania.
[03:42:23.973 --> 03:42:25.294]  I guess he's not in Philadelphia anymore.
[03:42:25.334 --> 03:42:25.955]  Joe, where are you?
[03:42:26.495 --> 03:42:27.336]  Yeah, I'm in Philadelphia.
[03:42:27.356 --> 03:42:29.198]  I'm actually on the Rocky Steps.
[03:42:30.339 --> 03:42:34.322]  If you actually pan over here and look you can see
[03:42:35.413 --> 03:42:35.753]  I don't know.
[03:42:55.038 --> 03:43:03.367]  We saw earlier this month 46,000 Democrats switched over to Republican simply to vote for Donald Trump this election.
[03:43:03.667 --> 03:43:07.771]  And in Massachusetts you have 20,000 Democrats who did the exact same thing.
[03:43:08.112 --> 03:43:14.979]  So everything that you're seeing being portrayed in the mainstream media is mostly false because there are tons of people in record numbers who love Trump.
[03:43:15.479 --> 03:43:22.905]  Even the union guys, the Teamster guys, who can't even come out publicly saying it yet, but they really do like Trump.
[03:43:22.945 --> 03:43:24.366]  I spoke with a bunch of guys the other day.
[03:43:24.646 --> 03:43:40.998]  There's some guys that even said that if Trump even comes out and mentions how he supports unions, he supports the Teamsters, these guys are gonna switch over from Democrat, they're gonna vote Republican, they're gonna vote Donald Trump in Pennsylvania because, hey, you've got Philadelphia and you got Pittsburgh, two huge union
[03:43:42.256 --> 03:43:42.516]  I don't
[03:43:57.176 --> 03:44:08.624]  At this time, when Ronald Reagan was running 36 years ago, at this time in the election, he was 15 points behind an incumbent president, and everybody was saying, Ronald Reagan can't win.
[03:44:08.684 --> 03:44:15.108]  But Ronald Reagan did win, mainly because of the migration of people who understood how they were being screwed by the system.
[03:44:15.508 --> 03:44:24.174]  And it's far worse now, because now we've got NAFTA that's been in place for 23 years, and we've got these Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic partnerships that are coming up.
[03:44:24.574 --> 03:44:34.718]  People need to understand that Ted Cruz wrote an op-ed piece a year ago, April 2015, with Paul Ryan talking about how that was free trade, how it was essential.
[03:44:35.078 --> 03:44:46.463]  He shut down the efforts by Senator Sessions to stop the movement of the Trade Promotion Authority, which essentially denied the constitutional process to ratify these treaties.
[03:44:46.923 --> 03:44:51.905]  Ted Cruz says he's a constitutionalist, and yet he pushed to shut down the TPA,
[03:44:52.665 --> 03:45:00.170]  Which is the, which says we're not going to have a 67 vote majority to push forward a treaty.
[03:45:00.210 --> 03:45:04.293]  We're simply going to have a majority in both houses and we're not going to have any amendments.
[03:45:04.313 --> 03:45:05.534]  We're not going to have any discussion.
[03:45:05.574 --> 03:45:07.015]  We're not going to have any filibustering.
[03:45:07.455 --> 03:45:10.897]  Ted Cruz, Mr. Constitution, voted to shut that down.
[03:45:10.957 --> 03:45:16.341]  Of course, the second vote that they had, they didn't need his vote, so he switched his vote so he could say, well, he voted against the TPA.
[03:45:16.981 --> 03:45:21.445]  But that's the kind of lying lawyer that manipulates everything that Ted Cruz is.
[03:45:21.485 --> 03:45:28.691]  And people need to understand that he is with the establishment of both parties who want to push through these trade agreements.
[03:45:28.731 --> 03:45:44.724]  And I think even though Bernie Sanders says that he's against the TPP and the TTIP, I have absolutely no confidence that he has the force of personality where he can oppose the establishment of both the Democrats and the Republicans who want to get these through, even if he were elected president.
[03:45:44.784 --> 03:45:45.625]  I believe that Trump
[03:45:46.025 --> 03:45:48.706]  Could, and I believe Trump would, because he would use the people.
[03:45:49.287 --> 03:45:53.609]  Tell us what you saw there in terms of the Amtrak derailment, Joe.
[03:45:54.289 --> 03:46:04.554]  Well, yesterday I got out there about an hour and a half after the crash happened, and I was able to, I mean, you could see from a mile away what was going on.
[03:46:04.614 --> 03:46:13.779]  Cops everywhere, you know, union workers, people on the track, Amtrak workers, investigation trucks and things like that, people out there conducting all these investigations.
[03:46:14.219 --> 03:46:23.211]  And they had that whole area essentially locked down, but I was able to find a walkway between two houses to get up on the railroad and get a little bit of footage for a minute before I kind of got shooed away.
[03:46:23.651 --> 03:46:25.494]  But, uh, you know, this is 2016.
[03:46:25.554 --> 03:46:26.114]  It's a railroad.
[03:46:28.698 --> 03:46:29.619]  It goes one way.
[03:46:30.099 --> 03:46:31.260]  You know, back and forth.
[03:46:31.800 --> 03:46:42.866]  You can't tell me that in 2016 we don't have a way to devise to notify these workers that that's going to be a so-called hot track where there's going to be a train coming through and to not have that equipment on there.
[03:46:43.146 --> 03:46:47.189]  You know, this thing moves at over 100 miles an hour through that location.
[03:46:47.689 --> 03:46:48.049]  I think so.
[03:47:16.650 --> 03:47:33.468]  You know, Joe, when we look at this, and we'll get to the report about the Bin Laden SEAL team father probably in the next segment, when we look at this and we look at how hard the government is pushing the self-driving car network, that's a far more complex situation.
[03:47:33.569 --> 03:47:36.432]  As you pointed out, we got a train on tracks
[03:47:36.812 --> 03:47:49.320]  And they can't control that, and yet the government wants to control every single one of our cars and control all these events that are going to be coming onto the road, people that are not cars, pedestrians, various other things that are going to be happening.
[03:47:49.881 --> 03:47:55.044]  That ought to make everybody very, very concerned just about the safety issues there.
[03:47:55.364 --> 03:47:57.826]  But of course, the reason the government is promoting this
[03:47:58.226 --> 03:48:06.910]  And the reason the government is giving Google a pass, even though the state of California says, we're not too happy with Google's record with the smart cars, so we're going to put some restrictions on them.
[03:48:07.351 --> 03:48:10.512]  Now they go to the federal government so they can get these state restrictions off.
[03:48:10.712 --> 03:48:12.353]  They're not concerned about your safety.
[03:48:12.673 --> 03:48:13.914]  They're concerned about two things.
[03:48:13.954 --> 03:48:18.676]  The corporation wants profits, and the government wants control of your movement.
[03:48:18.716 --> 03:48:21.438]  It is a control grid that they're trying to impose on people.
[03:48:21.458 --> 03:48:25.740]  And so they're willing to sacrifice your safety when they can't even manage
[03:48:26.320 --> 03:48:32.662]  In this day and age, they can't even manage a railroad situation where, as you point out, it's simply a train moving down some tracks.
[03:48:33.283 --> 03:48:33.943]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:48:34.283 --> 03:48:43.827]  You know, another interesting thing as well, though, Bernie Sanders supporters, you know, the reason I'm in Philadelphia is for the fact that on Saturday there was the Democracy Spring.
[03:48:43.847 --> 03:48:46.968]  It was supposed to be the largest civil uprising in America.
[03:48:47.248 --> 03:48:55.491]  There was, you know, thousands of people who went on democracyspring.org and pledged to be here and not move unless they were arrested until their demands are met.
[03:48:55.871 --> 03:48:59.994]  And Saturday, the Democracy Spring started, and there were about 300 people.
[03:49:00.634 --> 03:49:05.157]  Those guys marched to Ridley Park Police Station, which is 15 miles south.
[03:49:05.497 --> 03:49:07.598]  And it got cold that night, dropped into the 30s.
[03:49:07.998 --> 03:49:11.921]  And in the middle of the night, 90% of those people bolted and went home.
[03:49:12.281 --> 03:49:20.085]  I guess these Bernie Sanders supporters figured that some other people were actually going to show up for them, protest and march for them to D.C.
[03:49:20.345 --> 03:49:22.066]  And they figured maybe they could just show up there on the 11th and
[03:49:23.067 --> 03:49:29.651]  You know, sit there and have a little Occupy movement and camp out and get all smelly and start infighting and look ridiculous at the end of the day.
[03:49:29.972 --> 03:49:41.879]  You know, it doesn't seem like they have... I mean, here they've got 300 people and as Rob was just pointing out in Wisconsin, they've got a thousand more people than could fit into the venue standing there listening to the speeches.
[03:49:41.979 --> 03:49:45.562]  It's amazing when you look at the disparity in support
[03:49:46.222 --> 03:50:05.347]  Uh, between the Democracy Spring and the leftists, the Black Lives Matter people, and the people who want to take our country back from these multinational globalists who are shutting us down by opening up the borders, by negotiating these trade agreements, and having our trade managed offshore by a commission.
[03:50:05.667 --> 03:50:07.788]  That's what both of these trade agreements are going to do.
[03:50:08.068 --> 03:50:08.648]  And then also,
[03:50:09.568 --> 03:50:15.549]  Setting up an international global tax and calling it saving the world with a climate treaty.
[03:50:15.589 --> 03:50:24.472]  It's absolutely amazing to see that there's absolutely no support for this other side pushing that and yet there's a lot of people who really understand what's going on with Donald Trump.
[03:50:25.652 --> 03:50:27.312]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:50:27.372 --> 03:50:30.133]  I mean, you know, when you come out to these events and you
[03:50:31.142 --> 03:50:32.203]  You talk to these people.
[03:50:32.523 --> 03:50:33.924]  You know, I met a lot of common ground.
[03:50:33.964 --> 03:50:36.345]  I found a lot of common ground with a lot of these Bernie supporters.
[03:50:36.385 --> 03:50:39.366]  And I broke down, I was like, how a lot of these guys are very similar.
[03:50:39.726 --> 03:50:48.431]  And I was like, what are you going to do if Hillary Clinton essentially steals this from the more popular vote on the Democrat side, which would be Bernie, because he has more people showing up, obviously.
[03:50:48.731 --> 03:50:49.912]  People are showing up in mass numbers.
[03:50:49.932 --> 03:50:53.113]  You don't see large groups of people with Hillary Clinton t-shirts running around.
[03:50:53.353 --> 03:50:56.475]  You see large groups of people with Hillary for prison t-shirts running around, you know?
[03:50:56.795 --> 03:50:59.197]  You know, so it's going to be interesting.
[03:50:59.237 --> 03:51:04.060]  The DNC is going to be held here in Philadelphia, and it's two weeks apart, I believe, from the RNC.
[03:51:04.360 --> 03:51:04.820]  Stay there.
[03:51:04.840 --> 03:51:06.081]  We're going to come right back to you, Joe.
[03:51:06.101 --> 03:51:10.064]  We're going to be right back with Joe, and he's going to tell us about the father, Bin Laden.
[03:51:10.524 --> 03:51:16.889]  And at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:17.589 --> 03:51:18.329]  What did I do?
[03:51:19.070 --> 03:51:26.392]  I created Extendivite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.

[03:54:14.943 --> 03:54:16.644]  David Knight here for the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:16.684 --> 03:54:17.964]  This is our final segment.
[03:54:17.984 --> 03:54:21.086]  We're going to be going back to Joe Biggs in Philadelphia in just a moment.
[03:54:21.126 --> 03:54:28.891]  He conducted an interview earlier with a father of one of the Bin Laden's SEAL team and we're going to talk to him about that.
[03:54:28.971 --> 03:54:30.892]  Before we go back to Joe, I just want to let you know that

[03:55:08.893 --> 03:55:11.115]  Joe, we've talked about a lot of things that you were there.
[03:55:11.195 --> 03:55:16.299]  Of course you went to cover the Democracy Spring and of course only about 300 people showed up.
[03:55:16.360 --> 03:55:17.741]  It was a big flop there.
[03:55:18.602 --> 03:55:21.806]  But you also saw the Amtrak derailment.
[03:55:21.826 --> 03:55:22.467]  We talked about that.
[03:55:22.507 --> 03:55:28.035]  But you interviewed one of the fathers of one of the members of the Bin Laden SEAL Team 6.
[03:55:28.356 --> 03:55:29.197]  Tell us what he had to say.
[03:55:30.086 --> 03:55:31.707]  Yeah, it's a really interesting story.
[03:55:31.747 --> 03:55:37.392]  I mean, people really need to go and look into extortion 17 if you haven't already done so thus far.
[03:55:37.732 --> 03:55:43.397]  You know, I had an opportunity, uh, there's a guy that actually hit me up on Twitter the other day and says, Hey, do you know about extortion 17?
[03:55:43.758 --> 03:55:44.658]  I said, yeah, of course.
[03:55:44.959 --> 03:55:46.640]  He goes, well, I know the father of one of the guys.
[03:55:46.660 --> 03:55:47.801]  I'm going to put you in touch with him.
[03:55:48.261 --> 03:55:48.442]  And, uh,
[03:55:49.342 --> 03:55:51.803]  Uh, his name is Charlie Strange.
[03:55:51.843 --> 03:55:53.003]  His son was Michael Strange.
[03:55:53.064 --> 03:56:04.828]  He was a codebreaker, uh, in the Navy, and he actually was with, uh, SEAL Team 6, uh, in the Abaddon Raid, and he was part of the mission, the Extortion 17, when the Chinook went down.
[03:56:05.268 --> 03:56:21.634]  Killing 15 SEAL Team 6 members, another group of Navy guys from the West Coast, his son Michael, and a group of other Army guys, reservists, and some other elite people as well.
[03:56:21.854 --> 03:56:23.175]  It's an interesting situation.
[03:56:23.215 --> 03:56:29.737]  They were going to try to save these Rangers who were being held down by combative fire.
[03:56:30.177 --> 03:56:30.318]  Yeah.
[03:56:30.378 --> 03:56:30.458]  Yeah.
[03:56:30.478 --> 03:56:30.618]  Yes.
[03:56:47.481 --> 03:56:52.889]  You would think you would take this kind of people, these SEAL Team 6 guys, the most elite soldiers in the military.
[03:56:53.349 --> 03:56:54.731]  These guys are the top.
[03:56:55.152 --> 03:57:01.020]  And you would think you would separate them in case an RPG hits a helicopter and takes down only some of the group.
[03:57:01.610 --> 03:57:30.224]  I interviewed Charlie Strange a couple years ago, and I remember him talking about how they violated all the protocol rules, but then what really got him started on this investigation was the fact that they covered up evidence and pictures that eventually surfaced showing some of these guys that they said had died in the crash, and it showed that they had been shot and other things had happened with them, and they gave them a book, if I remember correctly, that had blanked out pages in it and altered
[03:57:31.284 --> 03:57:32.906]  Uh, narrative as to what had happened.
[03:57:32.946 --> 03:57:35.248]  And so, I remember talking to Charlie Strange.
[03:57:35.268 --> 03:57:37.550]  You've got a new interview with him that we've got up on our site.
[03:57:38.191 --> 03:57:42.034]  And, uh, it is... People really need to take a look at this.
[03:57:42.054 --> 03:57:55.587]  They need to understand what is going on and how the government has operated in this cover-up mode and how they have betrayed these people that were in SEAL Team 6 and also dumped on their families.
[03:57:55.667 --> 03:57:56.848]  It's absolutely shameful.
[03:57:57.483 --> 03:58:02.664]  I believe that they knew something, you know, because the entire narrative behind the Bin Laden thing is kind of, you know, wishy-washy.
[03:58:02.784 --> 03:58:07.545]  You know, you're going after the most wanted man in the world, and then all of a sudden, you just dump him off in the ocean.
[03:58:07.885 --> 03:58:10.325]  You know, I think these guys were going to say something.
[03:58:10.726 --> 03:58:13.646]  They got him all on one helicopter, and then they ended it right there.
[03:58:13.946 --> 03:58:16.607]  And now you know this is set up because I actually got to see the documents.
[03:58:16.947 --> 03:58:19.307]  I got to see all the stuff that no one gets to see.
[03:58:19.587 --> 03:58:21.227]  There were IEDs set up in that area.
[03:58:21.267 --> 03:58:22.728]  That was an ambush waiting to happen.
[03:58:22.748 --> 03:58:23.388]  That was planned.
[03:58:24.108 --> 03:58:26.070]  Yes, that's what surfaced with his investigation.
[03:58:26.431 --> 03:58:28.793]  And of course, we've got a new interview with him.
[03:58:28.853 --> 03:58:30.335]  Joe Biggs got that up on our site.
[03:58:30.755 --> 03:58:32.918]  And there was another interview that we had a couple years ago.
[03:58:32.938 --> 03:58:35.040]  It was Larry Klayman was representing him at the time.
[03:58:35.360 --> 03:58:37.863]  Join us tonight at 7 central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:37.923 --> 03:58:39.245]  Eastern for the nightly news.
[03:58:39.405 --> 03:58:39.685]  Thanks, Joe.
