[00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:21.604]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.624 --> 00:00:22.945]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:26.969]  It's February 12th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.261]  Tonight, knock knock, who's there?
[00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:37.082]  The federal government and they want to check on your children.
[00:00:37.343 --> 00:00:37.663]  The U.S.
[00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:52.528]  Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services published a document that outlines a plan for state appointed monitors for home visits to check on parents and assess your child's well-being.
[00:00:52.608 --> 00:00:59.691]  The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:12.762]  Then, Cliven Bundy faces up to 42 years in prison as the federal government says he spearheaded a conspiracy to commit an evil offense against the United States.
[00:01:13.262 --> 00:01:18.923]  Plus, a Hillary Clinton superdelegate explains why your vote doesn't count.
[00:01:19.343 --> 00:01:23.224]  All that plus much more up next on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:01.624]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:03.206]  You can't survive without it.
[00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:04.308]  But where do you get it?
[00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:10.375]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:16.302]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:33.360]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.881]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.441]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:38.501]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:39.361]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:41.482]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:03:05.046 --> 00:03:08.288]  We haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children.
[00:03:08.548 --> 00:03:16.472]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:03:16.852 --> 00:03:21.814]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better investments.
[00:03:22.154 --> 00:03:24.496]  I want every agency to lean forward.
[00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:28.992]  Big Brother wants to be called Big Daddy now.
[00:03:29.492 --> 00:03:31.332]  Paul Joseph Watson writes, the U.S.
[00:03:31.372 --> 00:03:33.013]  Department of Education and the U.S.
[00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:47.637]  Department of Health and Human Services has published a draft document which outlines a plan that will treat families as equal partners in the raising of children, opening the door for government intrusion at all levels.
[00:03:47.897 --> 00:03:48.937]  The document states,
[00:03:49.437 --> 00:04:04.228]  The first step in systematically embedding effective family engagement practices in educational settings is to establish a culture where families are seen as assets and partners in children's development, learning, and wellness.
[00:04:04.408 --> 00:04:09.612]  The first two principles of effective family engagement practices state one.
[00:04:09.932 --> 00:04:12.293]  Create continuity for children and families.
[00:04:12.513 --> 00:04:23.076]  Implement a vision for family engagement that begins prenatally and continues across settings and throughout a child's developmental and educational experiences.
[00:04:23.416 --> 00:04:28.238]  Number two, value equal partnerships between families and professionals.
[00:04:28.438 --> 00:04:37.521]  Combine professional expertise with familial expertise to promote shared learning and responsibility for children's healthy development, learning, and wellness.
[00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.522]  Well, that's nice of them, isn't it?
[00:04:53.368 --> 00:04:53.969]  We're good to go.
[00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:21.752]  And that if parents are failing to meet the standards set, evidence-based parenting interventions will be made to ensure that children's social, emotional and behavioral needs are met.
[00:05:22.033 --> 00:05:23.995]  Will there be home visits, you ask?
[00:05:24.395 --> 00:05:27.057]  Well, the document states, home visits.
[00:05:27.498 --> 00:05:42.331]  To support ongoing relationship building with families, programs and schools should conduct periodic home visits so that teachers and families can get to know each other and communicate about children's goals, strengths, challenges and progress.
[00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:56.020]  If home visits are not possible for all families, school or programs should require that teachers or providers and families communicate at the beginning of the year to ensure that the relationship is started in a positive way.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.403]  The program bears the hallmarks of the controversial scheme in Scotland.
[00:06:00.703 --> 00:06:10.752]  Set to take effect later this year under which a shadow parent appointed by the government will monitor the upbringing of every child under the age of 18.
[00:06:10.793 --> 00:06:15.477]  The document also extends the understanding of the word family
[00:06:15.757 --> 00:06:20.279]  To include all the people who play a role in the child's life.
[00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:24.821]  A definition that could include not only teachers, but government monitors.
[00:06:25.121 --> 00:06:41.809]  In a related development, the federal government is pushing for a task force to oversee a program under which pediatricians and doctors would screen all students over 12 years old regularly for depression and issue prescriptions or treatment as necessary.
[00:06:42.049 --> 00:06:50.115]  Obviously the program will increase the likelihood of teenagers being given dangerous antidepressant drugs such as Prozac and Lexapro.
[00:06:50.356 --> 00:07:03.526]  This bold New World Order draft declaration is nothing less than a declaration of war on American families by pedophilic government overseers brought to you by the Obama administration.
[00:07:03.726 --> 00:07:11.689]  The very same administration that criminally wielded the power of the IRS and the NSA on their political adversaries.
[00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:14.570]  This is a big deal.
[00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.351]  A really big deal.
[00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:19.692]  Take a look at the document for yourself.
[00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:22.593]  I will leave a link in the description of this video.
[00:07:22.853 --> 00:07:25.434]  This is the New World Order on paper.
[00:07:25.714 --> 00:07:28.835]  Coming for you and your family with no apologies.
[00:07:29.475 --> 00:07:31.416]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[00:07:35.461 --> 00:07:37.983]  And another spectacular report from John Bowne.
[00:07:38.383 --> 00:07:42.506]  Let's talk about the Bundy family and the Hammonds, the whole land rights situation.
[00:07:42.546 --> 00:07:51.831]  Regardless of what you think about these families, about their tactics, I want you to understand, looking at home, when you guys call these guys Al Qaeda, they say that they're trying to overthrow the government and all that.
[00:07:52.532 --> 00:07:58.736]  It's not my view of these guys, especially Cliven Bundy, who's now being indicted on charges of conspiracy.
[00:07:58.976 --> 00:08:10.901]  You know, they're charging these guys with everything from assault on a federal law enforcement officer, which to my knowledge never happened, use and carry of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence and many other things as well.
[00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:14.463]  They said he's spearheading a conspiracy against the United States government.
[00:08:14.843 --> 00:08:25.607]  Now, once again, regardless what you think about these guys tactics at the Bundy Ranch situation where David Knight and Josh Owens were out there filming, to my knowledge, Cliven Bundy never assaulted anybody.
[00:08:25.787 --> 00:08:26.768]  They're saying that he was using a
[00:08:27.688 --> 00:08:30.990]  A firearm in the commission of a violent crime.
[00:08:31.451 --> 00:08:33.972]  So I don't know how you can hit this guy with those charges.
[00:08:34.052 --> 00:08:37.114]  Once again, you like them, you hate them, you love their tactics or not.
[00:08:37.575 --> 00:08:43.579]  I think these are completely bogus charges against Cliven Bundy and I'm sure many other people will be brought up on bogus charges as well.
[00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:54.646]  But the simple fact of carrying a crime for carrying a firearm during a crime of violence, I don't understand how they could possibly charge these guys with such an offense when they weren't even committing violent acts.
[00:08:54.666 --> 00:08:57.348]  So we'll just have to watch and see how this story develops.
[00:08:57.888 --> 00:09:04.314]  Now, a story that's been developing for a good while, even before I came here to InfoWars.com, is the story of Fast and Furious.
[00:09:04.354 --> 00:09:07.737]  We talk about it often, I'm sure you've heard about it, but now we have a new development.
[00:09:08.198 --> 00:09:12.222]  Court overturns order keeping Fast and Furious documents secret.
[00:09:12.782 --> 00:09:16.205]  The ruling does not necessarily mean that the eight documents will be released.
[00:09:16.566 --> 00:09:18.908]  Instead, a three-judge panel of the U.S.
[00:09:18.968 --> 00:09:20.409]  Court of Appeals for the D.C.
[00:09:20.449 --> 00:09:26.695]  Circuit merely referred the matter back to a lower court to seek clarity about another judge's order.
[00:09:27.196 --> 00:09:30.399]  So, as we've been trying to find out for a long time, well, we pretty much
[00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:31.360]  No, I don't think so.
[00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:48.179]  Was it this deputy secretary underneath Holder?
[00:09:48.219 --> 00:09:51.920]  So they want you to put this guy in prison and pay no attention to Holder.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.441]  It's very difficult for me to believe that Eric Holder had absolutely no idea that this was going on.
[00:09:56.761 --> 00:09:59.982]  Even if he wasn't personally involved, if he knew about it, he should be held accountable.
[00:10:00.422 --> 00:10:03.222]  It's like if something happened, a local police chief, right?
[00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:11.924]  If his officers were giving guns to the local gangs and the police chief knew about it, he's supposed to come in, interdict and discipline those officers.
[00:10:11.964 --> 00:10:12.864]  But that did not happen.
[00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:14.805]  So we'll just have to wait and see what develops.
[00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:18.806]  The developing situation with Bernie Sanders and Mrs. Clinton.
[00:10:19.406 --> 00:10:24.808]  As you guys may recall, Bernie had a pretty good lead in New Hampshire in the New Hampshire primary.
[00:10:24.868 --> 00:10:26.949]  Pretty much whooped Hillary's butt out there.
[00:10:27.609 --> 00:10:35.011]  And even before the race began, before the primary began, she had a several delegate jump on Mr. Sanders.
[00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:35.752]  And this is why.
[00:10:35.832 --> 00:10:36.812]  She had superdelegates.
[00:10:37.212 --> 00:10:38.973]  And this is why your vote doesn't count.
[00:10:39.813 --> 00:10:50.222]  Of the 712 Democratic superdelegates, at least 394 have already pledged support for Clinton, and more are expected to back the former Secretary of State.
[00:10:50.682 --> 00:10:58.529]  And it breaks down all the delegates, all the numbers that you need, but you can see quite clearly that Hillary does have a jump on Bernie in that department.
[00:10:58.869 --> 00:11:03.773]  And for more on this, we go to our reporter Richard Rees, who's going to break down the superdelegate situation.
[00:11:05.322 --> 00:11:10.586]  We're here at the Red Arrow Diner and we've gone further down the bar here and we've found this gentleman.
[00:11:10.626 --> 00:11:11.107]  What's your name?
[00:11:11.347 --> 00:11:13.388]  Bob Mulholland from Chico, California.
[00:11:13.408 --> 00:11:16.631]  I'm a DNC member, thus a superdelegate to the National Convention.
[00:11:17.452 --> 00:11:20.734]  Wow, so that's the first time I can think of that I've talked with a Democratic superdelegate.
[00:11:21.115 --> 00:11:21.415]  Tell us...
[00:11:22.299 --> 00:11:23.660]  How long have you been a superdelegate?
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.800]  How long have you been a delegate?
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.221]  And tell us a little bit more about the process of how you get to be a superdelegate.
[00:11:28.661 --> 00:11:31.842]  There's several ways, but this will be my 11th national convention.
[00:11:32.282 --> 00:11:33.543]  I've been a superdelegate since 1992.
[00:11:33.683 --> 00:11:39.425]  In our case, in California, you have to get elected by the California Democratic Party to be on the DNC.
[00:11:39.785 --> 00:11:42.486]  Obviously, Democratic governors are automatic superdelegates.
[00:11:43.366 --> 00:11:49.728]  So, understandably, it sounds like Hillary is going to have a huge edge when it comes to superdelegates, is that correct?
[00:11:49.948 --> 00:11:56.231]  Oh yeah, and former DNC chairs like Howard Dean, who's from Vermont, he's known Bernie for decades, he's for Hillary.
[00:11:56.691 --> 00:12:01.392]  Yeah, the people who have worked with Hillary for decades are big supporters of her.
[00:12:01.633 --> 00:12:05.114]  If they haven't said so yet, they will over the next several weeks.
[00:12:05.908 --> 00:12:13.754]  So roughly, when it comes to the Democratic National Convention, what is the rough total of delegates that are going to be available for the DNC?
[00:12:14.815 --> 00:12:15.756]  Right now, about 4,800.
[00:12:16.596 --> 00:12:20.359]  So you need about almost 2,400 to get the nomination.
[00:12:20.839 --> 00:12:25.723]  And the way we work is that anybody who gets 15% more in an election gets delegates.
[00:12:25.863 --> 00:12:27.825]  So this election will go all the way to California.
[00:12:28.225 --> 00:12:31.928]  Sanders will end up with well over 1,000 delegates, and Hillary will get the nomination.
[00:12:32.734 --> 00:12:39.040]  Okay, now the superdelegates are basically what Hillary pretty much already has in her pocket.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.062]  How many delegates does that amount to?
[00:12:41.242 --> 00:12:41.982]  750 delegates.
[00:12:42.042 --> 00:12:44.425]  My guess is she probably has half of them committed to her.
[00:12:44.905 --> 00:12:49.869]  But she's out there working the precincts and working the states every day for every vote.
[00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.392]  And March 1st is Super Tuesday.
[00:12:52.752 --> 00:12:55.414]  At the end of the day, you will see that Hillary
[00:12:56.115 --> 00:13:07.577]  has the most delegates of regular people from caucuses like Iowa, from New Hampshire primaries, Nevada, South Carolina, and then all those states on March 1st.
[00:13:09.138 --> 00:13:11.560]  And as I always say, I'm not a Bernie Sanders supporter.
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.323]  I'm not encouraging you, the viewer, to vote for Bernie Sanders.
[00:13:14.943 --> 00:13:26.854]  But if you, for whatever reason, think you can get all this free stuff from Bernie Sanders and you're feeling the burn, you may want to take this pretty serious because Mrs. Clinton already seems to have this thing in the bag as far as the Democrat vote is concerned.
[00:13:26.874 --> 00:13:28.235]  You need to get on that one.
[00:13:28.495 --> 00:13:33.360]  Now let's talk about Sanders saying that he's not going to be beholden to the Bilderberg kingpin, Kissinger.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:49.307]  When Bernie Sanders isn't talking about raising taxes and giving away free stuff, he sometimes makes good points, as evidenced by a portion of last night's Democratic debate between himself and Mrs. Clinton, when the senator slammed her for connections to elitist insider Henry Kissinger.
[00:13:50.267 --> 00:13:56.770]  Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.
[00:13:58.237 --> 00:14:02.262]  I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.
[00:14:03.083 --> 00:14:05.787]  I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.
[00:14:06.348 --> 00:14:10.453]  Now he's urging American companies to shut down and move to China.
[00:14:10.753 --> 00:14:11.955]  Not my kind of guy.
[00:14:12.215 --> 00:14:16.461]  Count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.
[00:14:18.871 --> 00:14:20.292]  And he hits on a good point right here.
[00:14:20.352 --> 00:14:27.916]  He's talking about who these guys' advisors are, who their influences are, and when you say somebody like Henry Kissinger, he made a lot of good points in that.
[00:14:28.437 --> 00:14:36.222]  All the things that this guy's done, and that's just a small fraction of the history of Henry Kissinger, so I do encourage you guys to go and look that up for yourself.
[00:14:36.502 --> 00:14:36.822]  Pretty much,
[00:14:37.162 --> 00:14:37.302]  I don't
[00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:58.510]  No rebuttal.
[00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:03.214]  She sat there, you know, kind of shocked and embarrassed and then like, well, what am I going to say to this?
[00:15:03.494 --> 00:15:06.617]  You can't say anything to that because it's the truth and people need to know it.
[00:15:06.957 --> 00:15:09.299]  So good to you on that one, Bernie Sanders.
[00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:14.603]  And now as we're talking about Mrs. Clinton, we all know about the email scandal, how they've drawn this thing out.
[00:15:14.643 --> 00:15:15.864]  They don't want to talk about it.
[00:15:16.184 --> 00:15:23.991]  They are finally going to get around to releasing some, some, about 14% of Mrs. Clinton's emails over the President's Day holiday weekend.
[00:15:25.134 --> 00:15:28.598]  And what could be considered the latest episode in the Clinton email saga?
[00:15:28.878 --> 00:15:35.264]  We see that the State Department is set to release 550 Clinton emails over the President's Day weekend, reports The Hill.
[00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:44.294]  Now, just like we saw with the National Defense Authorization Act that was signed into law over the holiday of New Year's, they're doing a similar thing here with the Clinton emails to make sure
[00:15:44.574 --> 00:15:44.774]  I think so.
[00:15:59.778 --> 00:16:05.642]  Fourteen percent of the 3,700 remaining Clinton emails in the middle of the President's Day weekend.
[00:16:06.043 --> 00:16:14.929]  Now, this doesn't mean that we're going to get to the bottom of all the things we want to know about, because if you recall, Fox News recently reported that some emails are, quote, too damaging to release.
[00:16:15.249 --> 00:16:20.813]  And this is somebody high up saying that there are about 22 documents that aren't expected to be released any time soon.
[00:16:21.153 --> 00:16:23.675]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:16:25.979 --> 00:16:26.860]  That's how they get you.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.401]  They put all that stuff out when you are not paying attention.
[00:16:29.701 --> 00:16:31.582]  But people are paying attention to Donald Trump.
[00:16:32.002 --> 00:16:34.184]  Once again, he's in that same category of Bernie Sanders.
[00:16:34.204 --> 00:16:37.585]  I'm not going to vote for the guy, but he can make good points when he feels like it.
[00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:44.829]  And Trump is telling the truth about intervention, foreign policy, all these things, because he recently had an appearance on a TV show.
[00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:46.911]  And if you watch the thing, it's really quite
[00:16:47.751 --> 00:16:54.259]  It's entertaining to me because you can see all the pundits, you know, looking at him funny and staring at him like, oh, Mr. Trump, you're making such good points.
[00:16:54.279 --> 00:17:03.710]  You know, once again, he says plenty of things I don't agree with, but time to time he does make the good point about the foreign policy and how we would be better off if we didn't go into places like Benghazi.
[00:17:04.031 --> 00:17:04.371]  Tear it up.
[00:17:04.411 --> 00:17:05.933]  You saw the movie 13 Hours, right?
[00:17:05.993 --> 00:17:07.155]  At the end of the movie, it has the
[00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:08.036]  I think so.
[00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:26.751]  Russia is hitting the groups that we're backing.
[00:17:26.771 --> 00:17:26.991]  Sure.
[00:17:27.151 --> 00:17:28.292]  And why are we backing the group?
[00:17:28.312 --> 00:17:29.633]  We don't even know who those people are.
[00:17:29.913 --> 00:17:30.734]  I speak to generals.
[00:17:30.914 --> 00:17:35.737]  They're saying, we're giving billions of dollars of equipment to people we have no... Here we go again.
[00:17:36.317 --> 00:17:41.121]  We're giving all of this money and all of this equipment to people we have no idea who they are.
[00:17:41.181 --> 00:17:43.582]  Let's say you get rid of Assad or you knock out that government.
[00:17:43.602 --> 00:17:44.383]  Who's going to take over?
[00:17:44.443 --> 00:17:45.404]  The people that we're backing?
[00:17:45.444 --> 00:17:47.265]  And then you're going to have, like Libya?
[00:17:48.145 --> 00:17:48.366]  Right?
[00:17:48.826 --> 00:17:50.007]  You take Qaddafi.
[00:17:50.147 --> 00:17:51.508]  Oh, we have to get rid of Qaddafi.
[00:17:51.568 --> 00:17:53.469]  Look what happened after we got rid of Qaddafi.
[00:17:54.089 --> 00:17:57.371]  And good points like that get lost into the mystique of Trump.
[00:17:57.411 --> 00:18:01.874]  I know he says a lot of things to rub people the wrong way, but let's just focus on the man's policies.
[00:18:01.894 --> 00:18:04.316]  Just like I'm talking about Bernie, let's focus on the guy's policies.
[00:18:04.676 --> 00:18:09.319]  Yeah, they say stuff I agree with, things that I passionately disagree with, but that's how you judge the tree.
[00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:13.142]  You don't, you know, he said this about that guy or he doesn't like Megyn Kelly or Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:18:13.382 --> 00:18:17.044]  Look at the guy's policies and then you'll find out what's really going on beneath the surface.
[00:18:17.384 --> 00:18:17.845]  Now coming up,
[00:18:18.305 --> 00:18:19.626]  We'll talk to Lou Rockwell.
[00:18:19.646 --> 00:18:23.928]  He was on the Alex Jones Show today, breaking down all the things that are going on in our society currently.
[00:18:24.248 --> 00:18:32.133]  And also, we'll have a special report from Dan McAdoo, talking about the push for feds to have home visits to spy, basically, on your children.
[00:18:32.333 --> 00:18:40.238]  I've always felt the nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[00:18:50.157 --> 00:18:52.704]  This is an American president.
[00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:56.835]  Just add puppet, then vote and repeat every four years.
[00:19:10.766 --> 00:19:12.068]  We believe in win-win, folks.
[00:19:12.128 --> 00:19:13.869]  Treating people like we want to be treated.
[00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.634]  That's why we developed IntraCeuticals with Dr. Group and other top researchers, chemists, scientists, you name it.
[00:19:18.794 --> 00:19:19.735]  He's one of our advisors.
[00:19:20.016 --> 00:19:25.481]  To come up with products like AnthroPlex that is an original product that he made just for us.
[00:19:26.422 --> 00:19:28.384]  And this is a base
[00:19:29.298 --> 00:19:34.120]  system to make super male or super female vitality work even better.
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.180]  It is natural.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.482]  It just helps get your body pumping and going in the way you need to be going.
[00:19:40.882 --> 00:19:54.566]  And Dr. Group is here until we go to break to tell us about the latest product at InfoWarsLife.com, AnthroPlex, that out of the gates, and we do this all the time with the new product, we discount it out of the gates to get you to try it, knowing that you're going to love it.
[00:19:55.566 --> 00:19:56.187]  It'll sell out.
[00:19:56.527 --> 00:20:07.295]  So, Infowarslife.com, Anthroplex, 15% off and free shipping for the next two days only when you get it with Supermail or Female Vitality.
[00:20:07.435 --> 00:20:08.215]  Let's go to Dr. Group.
[00:20:08.396 --> 00:20:14.240]  Why do you call this the foundation to start the fire and then the Supermail takes you to the next level?
[00:20:15.455 --> 00:20:32.302]  Well, we just look at the base problem that's going on right now all over the world, which is the endocrine-disrupting chemicals, the amount of estrogen that men have, the femininity of men, and what's going on even in children right now with low testosterone levels.
[00:20:32.782 --> 00:20:33.443]  We're good to go!
[00:21:00.939 --> 00:21:02.800]  What is in the goat weed?
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.300]  You've got one of the purest, strongest organic forms of it.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.921]  What's so magic about the goat weed?
[00:21:20.225 --> 00:21:33.334]  Well the horny goat weed was given that name because years ago in India they noticed that a certain time of the year this weed would grow and the goats would eat it and they would just go crazy with all the female goats.
[00:21:33.414 --> 00:21:34.935]  So that's how it was developed.
[00:21:34.955 --> 00:21:35.896]  It's called epimidium.
[00:21:36.696 --> 00:21:43.400]  And what that's been proven to do over thousands of years is increase sexual pleasure, help balance the male hormones.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.181]  It can actually be used for women as well.
[00:21:45.621 --> 00:21:52.485]  But it really kind of resets and brings the hormone balance, improves sperm motility, and increases testosterone levels.
[00:21:52.505 --> 00:21:54.506]  So it counters the stuff they've been throwing at us.
[00:21:54.766 --> 00:21:55.866]  Results will vary.
[00:21:55.946 --> 00:21:58.588]  Overall, all I know is dynamite.
[00:21:59.028 --> 00:22:03.893]  I mean, absolutely dynamite with the stamina, with the weight lifting, with the swimming.
[00:22:04.133 --> 00:22:09.137]  Folks, the new product is available, AnthroPlex, available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:09.498 --> 00:22:11.640]  Dr. Group, thank you for developing this amazing product.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.080]  Thank you.
[00:23:05.112 --> 00:23:08.353]  Lew Rockwell, LewRockwell.com, excellent news site as well.
[00:23:08.933 --> 00:23:18.157]  And again, I can't go over all of his bio, it would take too long, but he's the chairman of the Lubitz von Mies Institute, Austrian Economics, the answer to crony capitalism, in my view.
[00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:21.038]  And of course, he served as Ron Paul's chief of staff and a lot more.
[00:23:21.418 --> 00:23:23.679]  He was also the Republican Party nomination.
[00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:27.921]  He ran that exploratory committee for Ron Paul as well.
[00:23:28.421 --> 00:23:30.242]  And I'm going to stop right there, sir.
[00:23:32.108 --> 00:23:39.641]  You've heard my preface, but I'm asking you, as a knowledgeable statesman in the fight for human dignity,
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.901]  What is this hallucination we're witnessing?
[00:23:42.981 --> 00:23:44.201]  Is this the death throes?
[00:23:44.281 --> 00:23:45.522]  Is it a tenter tantrum?
[00:23:46.342 --> 00:23:47.482]  Or do you disagree with me?
[00:23:47.562 --> 00:23:53.784]  Or are we seeing just bizarre displays of collectivist mental illness?
[00:23:53.844 --> 00:23:56.905]  Because it just gets, you know, ban the word father and mother.
[00:23:56.965 --> 00:23:58.626]  Ban the words founding fathers.
[00:23:59.066 --> 00:24:00.526]  Use she or thee.
[00:24:00.826 --> 00:24:02.787]  I mean, it's beyond any cult.
[00:24:03.087 --> 00:24:06.168]  If I read a novel about a cult like this, I wouldn't believe it.
[00:24:06.228 --> 00:24:08.149]  I mean, it's cult programming.
[00:24:09.315 --> 00:24:10.415]  What do you say to that rant, sir?
[00:24:11.616 --> 00:24:15.117]  Well, it is crazy, and I somehow think it's the neocons.
[00:24:15.137 --> 00:24:18.999]  I mean, I can't believe that sometimes I miss the Rockefeller world empire.
[00:24:19.699 --> 00:24:23.280]  As evil as they were, they didn't actually seem to be insane.
[00:24:24.141 --> 00:24:25.241]  This bunch is insane.
[00:24:25.261 --> 00:24:35.025]  I don't care whether it's Hillary or it's the Republican version, Rubio and Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz and, of course, Bernie Sanders.
[00:24:35.883 --> 00:24:42.446]  There are a lot of crazy people, warmongers, people who clearly lust for shedding of blood.
[00:24:42.466 --> 00:24:44.507]  They lust for the shedding of blood of others.
[00:24:45.527 --> 00:24:49.049]  They lust for the shedding of the blood of Americans, too.
[00:24:49.749 --> 00:24:51.330]  So, it's absolutely true.
[00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:54.071]  They're sort of revealing their true selves.
[00:24:54.131 --> 00:25:00.354]  They do seem to be reveling in their victories, and they are enforcing insane policies.
[00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:06.592]  Can you believe that they talk about mandating the registration of women for the draft?
[00:25:07.272 --> 00:25:11.134]  And according to the poll anyway, 61% of American men went along with this.
[00:25:11.734 --> 00:25:12.994]  I mean, that's insane too.
[00:25:13.415 --> 00:25:13.615]  Why?
[00:25:13.675 --> 00:25:22.178]  And you know, of course, in some sense we can see the regime and these sorts of activities wanting to make men into women and women into men.
[00:25:23.392 --> 00:25:34.336]  And that goes along with all what you're talking about, the pronouns and getting rid of mothers and fathers, not having boys and girls sections in toy stores, or boys and girls sections in clothing departments.
[00:25:35.156 --> 00:25:37.997]  Everything has to be the same, or rather the same.
[00:25:38.677 --> 00:25:39.517]  What did Facebook say?
[00:25:39.557 --> 00:25:44.899]  That there were 65 genders that you could choose among for your own on Facebook.
[00:25:45.479 --> 00:25:49.481]  So this goes right along with the crazed statism.
[00:25:50.441 --> 00:25:50.821]  They are
[00:25:52.532 --> 00:25:53.812]  Just reveling in their power.
[00:25:54.153 --> 00:25:56.574]  And of course, these are people who love to do this to human beings.
[00:25:56.614 --> 00:25:57.835]  They just love to bomb.
[00:25:58.095 --> 00:25:58.835]  They love to kill.
[00:25:58.855 --> 00:26:00.036]  They love to crush.
[00:26:00.436 --> 00:26:01.356]  They love to dominate.
[00:26:01.376 --> 00:26:02.597]  They love to lie to us.
[00:26:02.617 --> 00:26:04.558]  They love to take our children away.
[00:26:05.098 --> 00:26:06.839]  And they like to destroy our communities.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:16.825]  Robert Nisbet, the great libertarian sociologist, pointed out that the state seeks to destroy every, what he called, intermediating institution.
[00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:22.575]  That is everything that stands between, he said, the naked individual and state power.
[00:26:23.096 --> 00:26:25.559]  They want to get rid of states versus the Fed.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.161]  They want to get rid of communities.
[00:26:27.421 --> 00:26:29.564]  They want to get rid of businesses, of churches.
[00:26:30.065 --> 00:26:31.727]  Ultimately, they want to get rid of the family.
[00:26:31.747 --> 00:26:32.888]  They want to get rid of parents.
[00:26:33.309 --> 00:26:34.690]  And this is, of course, Plato's
[00:26:35.551 --> 00:26:37.232]  This has been an ancient dream of these people.
[00:26:37.272 --> 00:26:38.112]  This is nothing new.
[00:26:38.132 --> 00:26:47.276]  That's why I love getting you on, because we could say the French Revolution, the Jacobins trying to hijack the Liberty Movement was the most modern, you know, roots of communism.
[00:26:47.296 --> 00:26:53.539]  But really it goes back to Plato and his plan to raise us like cattle and in the family itself.
[00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:58.921]  But then he would write the Allegory of the Cave, supposedly responding to his own vision.
[00:26:59.401 --> 00:27:00.902]  But he really is their god.
[00:27:01.462 --> 00:27:02.523]  He really is their model.
[00:27:03.563 --> 00:27:04.824]  How is their plan going?
[00:27:04.844 --> 00:27:15.827]  And of course, I think you had a Freudian slip there, because I know you've written about the so-called democratic socialism not existing, or libertarian socialism of Bernie Sanders.
[00:27:16.528 --> 00:27:23.250]  I mean, I don't want to hate Sanders, and it's true he's not owned by crony capitalists, but I mean, he's got to know socialism is a disaster.
[00:27:24.241 --> 00:27:26.483]  Well, you know, he says some good things.
[00:27:27.464 --> 00:27:30.786]  In the debate with Hillary the other night, he accused her of being pals with Kissinger.
[00:27:31.447 --> 00:27:36.751]  And, as you say, talked about Kissinger having caused the genocide in Cambodia.
[00:27:36.791 --> 00:27:39.694]  And by the way, that's just the beginning of Kissinger's war crimes.
[00:27:39.734 --> 00:27:40.674]  He's a very bad man.
[00:27:41.175 --> 00:27:44.878]  Man, and Bernie might have pointed out he's a big crony capitalist on Wall Street, too.
[00:27:45.338 --> 00:27:46.319]  Very, very bad guy.
[00:27:47.103 --> 00:27:49.464]  Uh, and he was right to point out that Hillary's connected with him.
[00:27:49.924 --> 00:27:52.866]  On the other hand, Bernie himself is clearly a neocon.
[00:27:52.886 --> 00:27:57.888]  You only had to hear him talk last night about the alleged threat from Russia and why the U.S.
[00:27:57.928 --> 00:28:01.930]  needs to practically call for a nuclear war with Russia.
[00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.531]  So this guy is no anti-war guy.
[00:28:04.572 --> 00:28:05.552]  He's not a peace guy.
[00:28:06.653 --> 00:28:10.295]  He reminds me that the neocons were originally all Trotskyites.
[00:28:10.395 --> 00:28:13.757]  Now they sort of moved away from that or pretend to move away from it.
[00:28:14.038 --> 00:28:14.858]  He's a throwback.
[00:28:15.639 --> 00:28:17.300]  Again, talk about Twilight Zone.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.340]  You just throw that out there.
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.101]  It's totally true.
[00:28:19.181 --> 00:28:21.683]  It's even been in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times.
[00:28:22.463 --> 00:28:43.015]  It's not debatable that the entire neocon command base got run out of Russia, their leader got killed with a ice axe in Mexico, Trotsky, and then they ran up here and took over the whole Republican movement and National Review and the CIA brought them in and then sent them into Chicago Business School and now they're back.
[00:28:43.375 --> 00:28:44.756]  They're all after Donald Trump.
[00:28:45.316 --> 00:28:48.638]  Now obviously Donald's not perfect, he says some stuff that I disagree with.
[00:28:49.899 --> 00:28:52.881]  But at the same time, I think it's him playing politics with Bernie.
[00:28:52.901 --> 00:28:58.544]  It's a little bit different because of the neocon background than hating Russia so much, which you just astutely spoke to.
[00:28:58.584 --> 00:29:00.366]  So maybe get into some background on that.
[00:29:00.426 --> 00:29:17.297]  But Trump and Bernie, though, being so popular, despite what mainstream media does, shows me that this is a emblematic gauge or weather vane, bellwether, of the fact that there is a true uprising against the establishment taking place right now.
[00:29:17.597 --> 00:29:18.098]  Lew Rockwell.
[00:29:18.618 --> 00:29:19.879]  Well, Trump says a lot of good things.
[00:29:19.919 --> 00:29:21.061]  He says a lot of bad things.
[00:29:21.501 --> 00:29:22.582]  He doesn't have a theory.
[00:29:22.722 --> 00:29:26.246]  I mean, there always need to be intellectuals in any movement like this.
[00:29:26.306 --> 00:29:28.528]  It can't just be one guy spouting off.
[00:29:28.548 --> 00:29:30.870]  There has to be a considered plan.
[00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.492]  There has to be a considered strategy.
[00:29:33.093 --> 00:29:35.255]  And unfortunately, that's lacking.
[00:29:35.275 --> 00:29:38.618]  On the other hand, his support, I would say, is by and large a very good thing.
[00:29:39.519 --> 00:29:40.240]  Bernie's support
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:52.250]  I don't know to what extent, you know, when he was talking about Kissinger last night, I wondered how many of his millennials have even heard of Kissinger, let alone know its significance.
[00:29:53.491 --> 00:29:54.472]  But I was glad he did it.
[00:29:55.072 --> 00:29:58.395]  On the other hand, I think he's fundamentally a very bad guy.
[00:29:58.415 --> 00:30:00.878]  Obviously, Hillary is a very bad person.
[00:30:01.338 --> 00:30:05.542]  All the Republicans are pretty bad, and Trump is
[00:30:06.172 --> 00:30:07.613]  Sometimes good, sometimes bad.
[00:30:08.073 --> 00:30:17.040]  But just the fact that these guys are both hated by the establishment, I don't know to what extent the hatred of Bernie is real versus manufactured.
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:21.323]  Not that they wouldn't rather have Hillary, but I think they could do just fine with Sanders.
[00:30:22.153 --> 00:30:24.654]  Socialism, yeah, socialism is a disaster.
[00:30:24.994 --> 00:30:26.935]  He doesn't, he's not a classic socialist.
[00:30:26.975 --> 00:30:29.676]  He doesn't want the government to own the means of production.
[00:30:30.016 --> 00:30:31.997]  He simply wants them controlled by the government.
[00:30:32.337 --> 00:30:34.498]  This is more properly described actually as fascism.
[00:30:34.518 --> 00:30:35.739]  That's right, he's more of a fascist.
[00:30:35.919 --> 00:30:36.739]  Socialism, yeah.
[00:30:37.359 --> 00:30:39.540]  And he's not a civil libertarian.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:45.122]  He wants the entire social justice warrior program put into place.
[00:30:45.643 --> 00:30:48.584]  He wants egalitarianism enforced on society.
[00:30:48.604 --> 00:30:50.965]  He wants everybody made equal by the state.
[00:30:51.585 --> 00:30:57.748]  And this is something that comes out of, you talked about the French Revolution, although we can trace it back to the Gracchi in ancient Rome.
[00:30:57.768 --> 00:30:58.968]  It has earlier roots.
[00:30:59.429 --> 00:31:01.970]  The notion that the state can make everybody equal.
[00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:07.732]  Now, since nobody is equal, Mises said that the key fact about the human race is our radical inequality.
[00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:15.656]  And he said, thank goodness, because if we weren't unequal and we were all identical, there couldn't be a market, there couldn't be social cooperation, there couldn't even be civilization.
[00:31:15.976 --> 00:31:20.218]  So inequality is not only a natural thing, a fundamental thing, but it's a good thing.
[00:31:21.005 --> 00:31:25.787]  But ever since, especially the French Revolution, these people have argued the state should make us equal.
[00:31:26.247 --> 00:31:29.609]  Since that's actually impossible, it gives all power to the state.
[00:31:30.029 --> 00:31:31.929]  So you can't, you have to believe in black law.
[00:31:31.949 --> 00:31:42.974]  And all you do is create a psychotic ruling class that didn't even get there by being some conquering king who at least had some attributes that he was a more manipulative, smarter, you know,
[00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:43.854]  I mean, is this level
[00:32:08.812 --> 00:32:09.173]  I don't
[00:32:27.569 --> 00:32:31.993]  Really becoming pure mercenaries of globalists and saying, no, we are totalitarian.
[00:32:32.013 --> 00:32:41.763]  I mean, I remember a few years ago, the editor of the Financial Times of London came out and he said, and he named myself and others, but he said in two different articles, he said, OK, we are totalitarian.
[00:32:41.783 --> 00:32:42.584]  We are taking over.
[00:32:42.604 --> 00:32:45.126]  It is a planetary government and we're smarter than you.
[00:32:45.246 --> 00:32:46.167]  And so we're going to do this.
[00:32:46.608 --> 00:32:48.730]  We deserve because we're smarter to rule you.
[00:33:14.893 --> 00:33:17.355]  This is Bernie Sanders and I'm quite upset.
[00:33:17.555 --> 00:33:24.298]  If you guys saw the Iowa Caucus the other night, you would know that I worked extremely hard for these votes.
[00:33:24.598 --> 00:33:30.761]  And the people that were working in the Iowa Caucus took what I worked hard for and gave it to someone else.
[00:33:31.081 --> 00:33:36.063]  A lying, cheating, horrible human being by the name of Hillary Clinton.
[00:33:38.244 --> 00:33:42.146]  I don't understand how anybody could like something like this.
[00:33:42.226 --> 00:33:54.492]  That you work hard for something your whole life and you earn something and then you're expected to give it to someone else who's not as deserving and is too lazy or more of a piece of crap than you are.
[00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:57.613]  What kind of person would even think about something like that?
[00:33:57.873 --> 00:34:01.235]  Hey, that'd be you, Bernie Sanders.
[00:34:01.475 --> 00:34:02.536]  Guess you just felt the Bern.
[00:34:03.656 --> 00:34:06.657]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:06.858 --> 00:34:07.478]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.301]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[00:34:14.641 --> 00:34:18.184]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:34:18.444 --> 00:34:21.067]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:34:21.387 --> 00:34:24.830]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:28.734]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts.
[00:34:28.854 --> 00:34:29.174]  I'm good.
[00:34:53.069 --> 00:34:54.110]  We're good to go.
[00:35:12.617 --> 00:35:18.719]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[00:35:18.759 --> 00:35:22.041]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:35:22.061 --> 00:35:23.801]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:35:23.841 --> 00:35:30.104]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:35:30.204 --> 00:35:36.106]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:35:36.246 --> 00:35:40.028]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:35:40.208 --> 00:35:43.169]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:35:43.289 --> 00:35:51.292]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:35:51.573 --> 00:35:53.613]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:35:53.673 --> 00:35:54.714]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:35:55.054 --> 00:36:03.822]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:37:07.432 --> 00:37:12.497]  This morning I got up at about 6 a.m., began to look at the news, and I get Google Alerts.
[00:37:13.318 --> 00:37:22.847]  I need to know which missiles are being fired at InfoWars, and my name is the radar system in which we know which the new attacks are.
[00:37:23.728 --> 00:37:30.775]  And I see these different articles, a whole bunch of them, the same Democratic Party, usual suspects with their M.O.
[00:37:32.503 --> 00:37:33.143]  Alex Jones.
[00:37:33.644 --> 00:37:40.088]  And then one of the top stories on Yahoo, Alex Jones says, break Bernie Sanders supporters jaws.
[00:37:40.868 --> 00:37:43.870]  And then I went and read the article, and I remember what I said yesterday.
[00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:45.471]  I said,
[00:37:46.275 --> 00:38:04.664]  Knowing fascism, knowing communism, the hundreds of millions dead, and to see these parasites living off all the Americans and others that fought communism and fascism and Nazism and totalitarianism, you know, it'd be great to see these people, you know, if they had broken jaws, figuratively, to realize how pathetic and stupid they are.
[00:38:04.684 --> 00:38:15.869]  I said they've never been in fights, they've never been in the real world, they live off what's left of capitalism and all the wealth and all the diversity and all the choices, and they basically piss on it for lack of a better term.
[00:38:16.773 --> 00:38:17.673]  And the full quote's there.
[00:38:17.693 --> 00:38:18.373]  They even link to it.
[00:38:18.393 --> 00:38:25.975]  They say, and Worshett Jones wants the supporters of Sanders to burn in camps.
[00:38:27.415 --> 00:38:42.579]  I don't apologize overall, but I apologize for the fact that I don't realize what enemies these people are and that I say things literary and in a literary fashion that they take out of context, obviously.
[00:38:44.375 --> 00:38:46.517]  If you listen to the full interview, I'm not apologizing.
[00:38:46.537 --> 00:38:47.157]  I'm not scared.
[00:38:47.177 --> 00:38:47.838]  It doesn't hurt me.
[00:38:47.858 --> 00:38:49.639]  It's not like I'm on the rocks or on the ropes.
[00:38:50.079 --> 00:38:52.041]  I'm just illustrating how these enemies operate.
[00:38:53.062 --> 00:38:54.923]  We're about nonviolence offensively.
[00:38:54.983 --> 00:38:56.304]  We're about winning an info war.
[00:38:56.324 --> 00:38:57.725]  We're trying to stop a civil war.
[00:38:57.945 --> 00:38:59.567]  Everybody knows we're trying to stop violence.
[00:39:00.107 --> 00:39:05.531]  I'm looking at the threat to myself and my family of socialism and communism and how it works and how it operates.
[00:39:06.051 --> 00:39:06.612]  And I say,
[00:39:07.495 --> 00:39:11.216]  My gosh, think of the hell that the Russians went through under communism.
[00:39:11.676 --> 00:39:19.798]  Think about Alexander Sheltsinich, and he said, oh, how we burned in the camps later, wishing, you can pull up his quote, we'd have done something earlier.
[00:39:19.818 --> 00:39:23.459]  I said in that quote, you guys, you live in the real world.
[00:39:23.519 --> 00:39:24.999]  You need to be in a fist fight.
[00:39:25.019 --> 00:39:27.460]  You need to live in reality and have a stand in line for your food.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:32.181]  You need to have your collective jaws broken before you're burning in the camps.
[00:39:33.463 --> 00:39:40.105]  Like Alexander Solzhenitsyn, burning with anger that he hadn't taken action when he was outside that gulag.
[00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:42.485]  And I said that, and that shows our enemy.
[00:39:44.206 --> 00:39:51.808]  That I quoted Alexander Solzhenitsyn about, let's not burn in the camps, and they turned that into, I want to burn Bernie Sanders, who's Jewish, in a camp.
[00:39:52.608 --> 00:39:53.748]  See how this filth works?
[00:39:54.068 --> 00:39:58.489]  It doesn't matter that both my grandfathers fought Hitler, in the European theater.
[00:39:58.929 --> 00:40:00.670]  It doesn't matter, they both almost died.
[00:40:01.621 --> 00:40:05.442]  When I'm in a plane crash, another in a bombing raid, it means nothing to these people.
[00:40:05.462 --> 00:40:14.445]  They will put a George Soros Nazi collaborator over me and over the First Amendment to literally destroy our country, and then sit there and tell us that we're Nazis.
[00:40:14.485 --> 00:40:18.446]  These people are the definition of scum!
[00:40:19.286 --> 00:40:24.508]  Do you think that you have, that rich people have undue influence in politics in America?
[00:40:24.748 --> 00:40:25.028]  Yes.
[00:40:26.188 --> 00:40:26.748]  Yes.
[00:40:27.048 --> 00:40:28.949]  But given the rules, you're not going to back out?
[00:40:30.531 --> 00:40:33.453]  No, I mean the other rich people who have influence.
[00:40:33.853 --> 00:40:38.174]  And I've got a big vocabulary, folks, but I'm telling you they are disreputable trash.
[00:40:38.214 --> 00:40:38.995]  They are scum.
[00:40:39.035 --> 00:40:42.636]  They are lying, twisting, deceitful filth.
[00:40:44.417 --> 00:40:45.737]  And I am so sick of them.
[00:40:46.698 --> 00:40:48.618]  I am so tired of their frauds and their lies.
[00:40:48.718 --> 00:40:51.800]  And I'll tell you this, no matter... We know Bernie Sanders is bad news.
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:55.161]  We know Donald Trump says some things that he's trying to act like a tough guy.
[00:40:56.002 --> 00:40:59.524]  At a fifth grade level, you know, I'll torture the terrorists, I'll protect you.
[00:40:59.785 --> 00:41:02.006]  He's trying to be the strong man for what he thinks American people want.
[00:41:02.606 --> 00:41:06.349]  And maybe he's right about his rhetoric, but I don't agree with some of the stuff he says about this.
[00:41:06.809 --> 00:41:22.099]  The Bilderberg Group, Davos, the globalists, the enemies, the CNBCs, the Time magazines, the Newsweeks, the Daily Beast, the lying trash scum, who I know is a cancer upon free speech and culture and everything else.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.601]  They hate Donald Trump, so that's why I'm backing.
[00:41:25.379 --> 00:41:30.304]  And it's not a fake attack on him where they act like they're attacking him for reverse psychology.
[00:41:31.025 --> 00:41:34.209]  Six, eight months ago, I thought that might be it and on air said I'm watching closely.
[00:41:34.269 --> 00:41:37.472]  No, no, they are in panic mode folks.
[00:41:38.113 --> 00:41:45.181]  And they're even in panic of their own socialist manifestation because they want a Bernie Sanders down the road.
[00:41:46.129 --> 00:41:55.592]  To collectivize some of the wealth to make the educated masses controlled by government contracts that Eisenhower warned of in the military-industrial-technological complex.
[00:41:55.632 --> 00:41:56.632]  He didn't just say military.
[00:41:56.652 --> 00:42:08.655]  It was first the technological complex of the elite, the technocrats controlling us through the funding that goes out with government contracts, creating a intellectual tyranny.
[00:42:09.155 --> 00:42:10.756]  The 21-minute speech is online, folks.
[00:42:10.796 --> 00:42:11.336]  Go watch it.
[00:42:12.496 --> 00:42:14.277]  And now we're in the hands of those people.
[00:42:15.245 --> 00:42:16.947]  And they can't compete with innovation.
[00:42:17.667 --> 00:42:19.469]  They can't compete with free market.
[00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:26.255]  So they have to then bring in crony capitalism, demonize free market, scapegoat it for their crimes.
[00:42:26.756 --> 00:42:33.902]  They're offshore, as I've said, on record, tax exempt, above the law, diplomatic immunity, and then they scapegoat it.
[00:42:33.982 --> 00:42:36.264]  And Bernie Sanders knows this.
[00:42:36.985 --> 00:42:39.547]  And he plays up, oh, the Walmart family has $200 billion.
[00:42:41.219 --> 00:42:43.460]  Oh, General Electric doesn't pay taxes.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.001]  Yeah, and your own buddy Obama gave them the waivers not to do it.
[00:42:46.701 --> 00:43:07.748]  So again, when I get up here and say that Bernie Sanders is a threat, he is a manifestation of how Hillary is meant to bring this system in, but he is a manifestation of what they've sold and the people they've created and the dumb masses that actually think socialism and communism delivers anything but slavery.
[00:43:08.048 --> 00:43:10.129]  Anything but not having your own free will.
[00:43:10.931 --> 00:43:13.952]  Alright, Bernie Sanders is offering you free stuff.
[00:43:14.872 --> 00:43:20.013]  He wants to give you free healthcare, he'd give you a free car, he'd give you a free house, but guess what?
[00:43:21.333 --> 00:43:22.433]  There is no free lunch.
[00:43:22.453 --> 00:43:26.114]  That just means somebody else is paying for it, but they're not showing you who's paying for it.
[00:43:28.174 --> 00:43:32.055]  And so that's why I get so mad at him, but let me be completely clear.
[00:43:32.615 --> 00:43:36.276]  I wish not a hair on that sack of crap's head.
[00:43:37.205 --> 00:43:48.467]  Ever be heard to turn that inhuman, parasitical maggot into a patriot, into a martyr.
[00:43:48.667 --> 00:43:49.908]  No, no, no.
[00:43:50.368 --> 00:44:01.850]  I wish no harm against Obama or Jeb Bush or Hillary or any of these parasites that think because they don't want to manipulate their God and have free will.
[00:44:02.916 --> 00:44:05.298]  I want to see their lives destroyed.
[00:44:05.618 --> 00:44:10.141]  I want to see their lives inflamed and burned down.
[00:44:11.042 --> 00:44:18.147]  I want to see their New World Order system burned as a funeral pyre against everything that they stand for.
[00:44:18.947 --> 00:44:21.009]  But that just shows how these people deceive.
[00:44:21.029 --> 00:44:21.889]  But I'll be honest with you.
[00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:24.311]  It is the coddled,
[00:44:25.453 --> 00:44:27.695]  Who would pay for the free tuition?
[00:44:39.045 --> 00:44:40.826]  Hopefully the rich people of America.
[00:44:41.327 --> 00:44:43.869]  They grew in the bosom of a free nation.
[00:44:43.889 --> 00:44:45.750]  They grew in the bosom of a free market.
[00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:48.272]  They have more choices than anybody else in the world.
[00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:51.895]  And they sit here arrogantly hating America.
[00:44:52.575 --> 00:44:54.016]  Hating what's good about freedom.
[00:44:54.396 --> 00:44:57.519]  Hating what's good about the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
[00:44:57.799 --> 00:45:04.544]  When the whole world wanted to come to the United States, not because it was perfect, but because it was the greatest expression
[00:45:05.251 --> 00:45:14.878]  of basic human will and liberty and had the most wiggle room, though it was somewhat of a cramped space.
[00:45:15.678 --> 00:45:24.665]  Though for many of us that really dream of true liberty and can imagine what humans could do, potentially, the word I would use is claustrophobic.
[00:45:25.245 --> 00:45:30.789]  But even the claustrophobia and all the problems of America compared to the tombs
[00:45:31.661 --> 00:45:57.322]  That our socialism, fascism, and communism, and all command and control systems, it makes me so incredibly sick to see these people falling, the sickness in their eyes, imagining dreams, not in books they write, or music they write, or songs they play, or art they paint, or food they cook, or jaws they set, or legs they fix, or crops they plant, or children they reach,
[00:45:58.324 --> 00:45:59.785]  Or carburetors they repair.
[00:46:00.286 --> 00:46:02.408]  They dream through a state.
[00:46:02.548 --> 00:46:04.169]  They dream through a system.
[00:46:04.429 --> 00:46:14.917]  They dream through a God like Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton that would deliver them free goodies like the Easter Bunny or Santa Claus.
[00:46:15.238 --> 00:46:17.019]  The Easter Bunny isn't real, folks.
[00:46:17.479 --> 00:46:18.780]  Santa Claus isn't real.
[00:46:19.881 --> 00:46:20.522]  And let me tell you,
[00:46:21.522 --> 00:46:29.824]  The sprites that bring you free goods and their black uniforms and their shiny boots and their submachine guns are bringing you into total slavery.
[00:46:29.864 --> 00:46:40.767]  And I can look at that creature, Bernie Sanders, and that creature, Hillary Clinton, and I can tell you unequivocally, they point at the crimes that their crony system has created and engineered.
[00:46:41.207 --> 00:46:47.588]  They point at the very people that have financed them and tell us that going deeper into their system will save us.
[00:46:47.648 --> 00:46:50.949]  They are total and complete.
[00:46:58.062 --> 00:47:01.703]  I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore!
[00:47:03.003 --> 00:47:04.024]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.544 --> 00:47:06.824]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.105 --> 00:47:14.967]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:09.381 --> 00:49:10.802]  One more thing about iconography.
[00:49:11.303 --> 00:49:14.885]  If you're a radio listener, you can't see this obviously, but I meant to make this point.
[00:49:15.446 --> 00:49:30.318]  Not even so much this debate, but the last Democrat debate, the one before that, she's wearing a gray outfit, a pink outfit, the new one is a yellow outfit, and it's canary yellow, and from the 1950s and 60s,
[00:49:32.352 --> 00:49:40.276]  The Communist Party women in China and Mao Zedong's wife wear the exact cut, the exact silk outfits.
[00:49:40.837 --> 00:49:44.319]  So again, these are all messages to their people.
[00:49:44.399 --> 00:49:45.339]  Hey, I'm a commie.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:51.403]  Just like with Obama, remember the artwork of his head turned to the side?
[00:49:54.725 --> 00:50:00.368]  The artwork with his head turned to the side is directly from the famous Stalinist-Leninist eras.
[00:50:01.372 --> 00:50:07.677]  And then when they have the artist on TV, they go, yes, I like the communist art and I like collectivism, so that's why we show it as this.
[00:50:07.697 --> 00:50:18.926]  And then the White House chooses terms like lean forward and capture the future and all this that is directly out of the Communist Manifesto itself.
[00:50:23.309 --> 00:50:25.531]  And of course, people make jokes out of it with their own posters.
[00:50:25.551 --> 00:50:28.253]  You can find the real forward posters with Obama.
[00:50:28.273 --> 00:50:30.375]  I mean, that is with the same hand sign as
[00:50:31.462 --> 00:50:31.902]  V.I.
[00:50:31.982 --> 00:50:32.262]  Lennon.
[00:50:33.603 --> 00:50:35.344]  Now let's go back to Sanders, though.
[00:50:37.304 --> 00:50:55.372]  The reason I get so angry at him is I know he's smart, and I followed him in the Senate for a decade, and I've seen him when they need a vote, one vote to make sure the Fed doesn't get audited, or to make sure there's a banker bailout, or to make sure, then, then he will vote for Wall Street, the corrupt elements of it.
[00:50:57.130 --> 00:51:03.893]  But when there's a whole bunch of votes short or whatever, and his vote doesn't count, then he'll vote the right way.
[00:51:04.273 --> 00:51:08.275]  He is a calculating manipulator.
[00:51:11.056 --> 00:51:12.816]  And he knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:51:12.916 --> 00:51:17.258]  And, you know, he wants to talk about the Khmer Rouge killing 30% of Cambodia?
[00:51:17.278 --> 00:51:21.160]  Yeah, that was a big... Brzezinski too.
[00:51:23.021 --> 00:51:23.961]  Involved in that big time.
[00:51:25.936 --> 00:51:29.017]  But notice, he points out the quote, Republican.
[00:51:29.497 --> 00:51:31.218]  To always make it partisan, no both parties.
[00:51:31.258 --> 00:51:32.538]  And it's horrible, and it's wrong.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.081]  But looking at Bernie Sanders, he knows full well what he's doing.
[00:51:39.381 --> 00:51:41.962]  Why does he talk about the 84 million killed by Mao Zedong?
[00:51:43.242 --> 00:51:46.403]  Why does he talk about the 20 to 30 million killed by Lenin?
[00:51:46.684 --> 00:51:47.684]  Same number by Stalin.
[00:51:49.741 --> 00:51:58.947]  I love how the so-called left talks about Hitler all day, and how Hitler killed millions and millions and millions of people no one probably even knows.
[00:52:00.548 --> 00:52:06.031]  But they admit that Germany's population was 21 million less at the end of the war in 1945.
[00:52:07.452 --> 00:52:07.792]  Look it up.
[00:52:09.273 --> 00:52:11.454]  The Russians lost 20 million people too.
[00:52:11.735 --> 00:52:14.716]  You never hear anything about the Russians or movies about all the dead Russians, do you?
[00:52:14.776 --> 00:52:14.836]  No.
[00:52:18.089 --> 00:52:19.330]  Russians killed by communists.
[00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:20.711]  You never hear about that.
[00:52:21.171 --> 00:52:22.632]  Or the Armenian genocide.
[00:52:22.792 --> 00:52:28.155]  Or the hundreds of thousands killed by the rebels that the West has put into Syria.
[00:52:28.996 --> 00:52:29.496]  Or Libya.
[00:52:30.777 --> 00:52:37.001]  They only tell you about genocides they want to tell you about that aren't really connected to a political movement.
[00:52:38.041 --> 00:52:38.642]  The left.
[00:52:40.894 --> 00:52:49.279]  is the most murderous killing organization in the world, and it has been since the French Revolution.
[00:52:49.299 --> 00:52:53.382]  And I've had top historians on, but you can go read the Encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:52:53.662 --> 00:52:55.743]  You can go get a book on the French Revolution, folks.
[00:52:56.664 --> 00:52:57.845]  It was the opposite of ours.
[00:52:58.485 --> 00:53:00.206]  That's why George Washington wrote against it.
[00:53:00.567 --> 00:53:02.408]  Jefferson, who was for it at first, turned against it.
[00:53:03.929 --> 00:53:07.251]  At one point, the French Revolution wanted to get their hands on Thomas Jefferson and kill him.
[00:53:09.386 --> 00:53:21.953]  The Jacobins that led it were an occult organization, basically Satanist, and they wanted to overturn the family, break down all of society, and have a world of living hell.
[00:53:23.294 --> 00:53:26.036]  But they would claim it would be for the people, but it wouldn't be.
[00:53:27.056 --> 00:53:31.619]  So I should do a special report on the origins of communism so people understand what it is.
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:36.922]  There was revolution at the peak of the Renaissance in the 1750s and 60s.
[00:53:39.764 --> 00:53:40.485]  Into the 70s.
[00:53:40.925 --> 00:53:45.549]  There was rebellion across England, across Europe, against the monarchs, and against the church.
[00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:55.917]  And Adam Weishaupt, at Ingolstadt University, who was a Jesuit, you can argue who infiltrated who, it's just a fact.
[00:53:57.318 --> 00:54:03.743]  Just like the new Pope wants open borders, except not at the Vatican, they have 200 foot walls, but he wants borders open here.
[00:54:04.044 --> 00:54:05.585]  He's gonna come pray at our border.
[00:54:08.063 --> 00:54:08.884]  Because he's the good guy.
[00:54:09.544 --> 00:54:12.446]  Well, they wanted no borders, no religion, no nothing.
[00:54:14.308 --> 00:54:24.376]  And so the Jesuit, look it up, created the Illuminati, which was really, it was called the Enlightenment in Europe before that, the Renaissance.
[00:54:24.416 --> 00:54:27.919]  It was led by Christians who were non-denominational.
[00:54:30.302 --> 00:54:30.962]  And welcome back.
[00:54:31.402 --> 00:54:32.943]  We have a new article on the site today.
[00:54:32.963 --> 00:54:36.605]  Feds push new plan for home visits to check on parents.
[00:54:36.665 --> 00:54:39.366]  Now we've seen similar things going on overseas in the UK.
[00:54:39.746 --> 00:54:44.408]  Now in the UK they go to the extreme degree of installing cameras in some people's homes.
[00:54:44.828 --> 00:54:45.909]  It's not that bad.
[00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:52.153]  For 1984 yet, I wouldn't be surprised if they'd like to see that happen, but it's not there right now.
[00:54:52.213 --> 00:54:59.277]  They're saying that they want feds to be able to come into your home and check on your children pretty much CPS anytime they feel like it.
[00:54:59.317 --> 00:55:05.260]  Now, I definitely do understand that there are unfit parents, people who are not raising their children properly.
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:10.023]  The kids are malnourished, they're whatever, you know, they don't have all the things they need.
[00:55:10.123 --> 00:55:13.485]  I do understand that, but when you have this type of pretty much
[00:55:14.025 --> 00:55:19.429]  Blanket saturation of them saying that we have a blank check to do pretty much anything we want at any time.
[00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:26.174]  That's when I get a little bit apprehensive or more than apprehensive about it because you can't just storm into somebody's home.
[00:55:26.514 --> 00:55:28.536]  Hey, I'm here to, you know, check on little Johnny.
[00:55:28.556 --> 00:55:29.477]  Well, little Johnny's fine.
[00:55:29.497 --> 00:55:30.978]  He's not in trouble in school.
[00:55:31.018 --> 00:55:31.798]  He's well fed.
[00:55:31.838 --> 00:55:35.441]  You know, he's not sick or anything, but well, we're just going to come in and check anyway.
[00:55:35.481 --> 00:55:36.582]  That's what they're moving forward.
[00:55:36.862 --> 00:55:39.064]  And here's Leanne McAdoo with more on that story.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:41.281]  That's right, Jakari.
[00:55:41.321 --> 00:55:45.745]  The government is actually opening the door for intrusion at all levels.
[00:55:46.045 --> 00:55:51.811]  Now the feds are pushing for a new plan that will include home visits so they can check in on parents.
[00:55:52.191 --> 00:55:54.573]  Now, this was a draft document published by the U.S.
[00:55:54.593 --> 00:55:56.555]  Department of Education and the U.S.
[00:55:56.575 --> 00:55:58.497]  Department of Health and Human Services.
[00:55:58.917 --> 00:56:03.402]  It outlines a plan that will treat families as equal partners.
[00:56:04.062 --> 00:56:10.665]  And it goes on to explain how they'll provide monitoring goals for the children at home and the classroom.
[00:56:10.985 --> 00:56:22.951]  And if parents fail to meet these standards that are set, they're going to have evidence-based parenting interventions to ensure that children's social, emotional, and behavioral needs are met.
[00:56:23.171 --> 00:56:32.076]  But of course, we know that this is going to be further intrusion at all levels to make sure that you're complying with how the government feels your children should be behaving.
[00:56:32.936 --> 00:56:43.042]  And also the document extends the understanding of the word family to include all of the people who play a role in the child's life in early childhood development.
[00:56:43.102 --> 00:56:48.466]  So this definition could include not only teachers, but also government monitors.
[00:56:48.786 --> 00:56:50.968]  So it's literally Big Brother now.
[00:56:51.428 --> 00:56:56.172]  And in a related development, the feds also want all teens screened for depression.
[00:56:56.593 --> 00:56:58.514]  Now these are recommendations by the U.S.
[00:56:58.574 --> 00:57:00.496]  Preventative Services Task Force.
[00:57:00.536 --> 00:57:10.585]  They published these recommendations earlier this week and they're recommending pediatricians and family doctors screen all students over 12 years old regularly for depression
[00:57:10.845 --> 00:57:11.185]  I think so.
[00:57:34.242 --> 00:57:38.225]  This could be very detrimental to the behavioral development of children.
[00:57:39.005 --> 00:57:43.267]  SSRIs are known to increase the suicidal thoughts of young people.
[00:57:43.548 --> 00:57:46.169]  It increases aggression as well as violence.
[00:57:46.489 --> 00:57:55.355]  And so these conditions are worse for young people who are just starting out on the SSRIs or if they're switching from one to another because it's not working.
[00:57:56.055 --> 00:58:00.878]  Also when they're being weaned off of these drugs, a lot of times the withdrawal symptoms are worse.
[00:58:01.438 --> 00:58:12.241]  Then the original symptoms that they started with and of course anyone can be seen with a behavioral issue if they're not complying with what the government is wanting to see there in its citizens.
[00:58:12.741 --> 00:58:16.883]  So we'll just have to kind of wait and see what all is happening here with this.
[00:58:16.923 --> 00:58:24.445]  But this is definitely not the time for parents to sit back and just allow these tools and these monitoring devices to come into their homes.
[00:58:25.205 --> 00:58:37.606]  This is indoctrination that's passing today for education in this country, so this is time for people to start exercising their constitutional right to privacy and put the brakes on the brave new world.
[00:58:39.056 --> 00:58:40.377]  Well, that's it for our show tonight.
[00:58:40.417 --> 00:58:44.221]  We do encourage you to go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get yourself a free trial.
[00:58:44.601 --> 00:58:51.188]  You can see the nightly news, the special reports, the rants, all right there at PrisonPlanet.tv, as well as the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:58:51.488 --> 00:58:53.650]  You can see many great special reports there as well.
