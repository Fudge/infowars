[00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:11.734]  The use of TSA body scanners has been a very controversial topic, with privacy advocates stating that the machines show too much of one's person.
[00:00:12.154 --> 00:00:14.536]  Health advocates and pregnant mothers concerned.
[00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.270]  Oh, excuse me, sir.
[00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:45.457]  We're asking people what they think about the TSA change in policy, eliminating the pat-down option.
[00:00:46.198 --> 00:00:47.338]  I have not heard about that.
[00:00:47.898 --> 00:00:48.038]  Oh.
[00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.020]  Well, I didn't have to go through security this morning, but you did.
[00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:55.262]  Um, I don't really... I think it's fine.
[00:00:55.642 --> 00:01:00.525]  I think as long as they still do a thorough check, then it shouldn't be a problem for anybody.
[00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:04.627]  I actually go through some of the pre-lines, so I don't have that deal.
[00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:06.208]  So, not worried about it.
[00:01:06.228 --> 00:01:08.929]  I do pre also, because I come here too much.
[00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:10.562]  Well, some people are concerned.
[00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:16.285]  You see, pregnant mothers and health advocates, they're concerned about the effects the machines could have on things such as unborn children.
[00:01:17.245 --> 00:01:23.728]  Well, okay, so you're talking about eliminating the ability to do a pat-down in lieu of the scanner?
[00:01:24.248 --> 00:01:25.789]  No, no, I think they'd need to keep it for that.
[00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.812]  Well, some people are concerned, such as pregnant mothers and health advocates, they're worried about the effects that the body scanners could have on unborn children.
[00:01:33.618 --> 00:01:35.639]  That's true, I didn't think about that.
[00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.782]  I mean, from what I've heard and what I've seen online and so forth, the radiation is really minimal.
[00:01:43.243 --> 00:01:53.848]  So, personally, I think if that's something that you're worried about, you probably should figure out a different way to get to where you're going.
[00:01:54.508 --> 00:01:55.588]  Well, I'm glad they're doing that.
[00:01:55.628 --> 00:01:57.289]  I don't like being patted at all.
[00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.951]  Pat somebody else, okay?
[00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:02.332]  I agree with you on that one.
[00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:04.848]  What did you think about it?
[00:02:04.868 --> 00:02:07.169]  It was very traumatic for me.
[00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.449]  What did you think about your wife going through it if she was pregnant?
[00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:15.430]  Well, I'm sure there probably needs to be more research to find out if it actually happens or not.
[00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:26.913]  It's interesting to note that the shining example for why body scanners are used in the first place is the underwear bomber, a person who was allowed through the security checkpoint many years ago.
[00:02:27.493 --> 00:02:32.014]  Meanwhile, a man was able to transport a pistol through security just this year.
[00:02:32.774 --> 00:02:42.316]  Also, even though the TSA has yet to stop a single terrorist attack, we saw the state of Texas threatened with a no-fly zone when they sought to oust the agency.
[00:02:42.976 --> 00:02:53.879]  And finally, activist John Corbett, who was previously censored by the TSA for posting documents that they themselves released, is suing the agency over the pat-down rule change.
[00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.939]  And there you have it.
