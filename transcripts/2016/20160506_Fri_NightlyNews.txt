[00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.223]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.283 --> 00:00:25.885]  It is Friday, May 6th, 2016 and I'm Leigh-Anne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.985 --> 00:00:27.045]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:31.168]  Tonight...
[00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.692]  With the current evidence, a legal expert says it would be nearly impossible not to charge Hillary.
[00:00:40.532 --> 00:00:45.033]  After that, a study shows the third leading cause of death in the U.S.
[00:00:45.213 --> 00:00:49.514]  has nothing to do with alcohol, tobacco, or firearms.
[00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:54.616]  And, does Bernie have the tools to clinch the Democratic nomination?
[00:00:55.476 --> 00:00:56.037]  That's next.
[00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.019]  There's no more these big Walmart people, the oil companies lie all day, but they know the earth is dying!
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.487]  It's not genetic engineering, it's not overfishing, it's not secret weapons that endanger us.
[00:01:22.968 --> 00:01:24.890]  It's carbon dioxide plants breathe.
[00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:25.692]  Is that clear?
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:10.232]  Well a new medical study released Tuesday shows that medical errors are now the third leading cause of death in the United States.
[00:03:10.632 --> 00:03:17.061]  So this is a new Johns Hopkins study and it was published in the BMJ on Tuesday and it shows that medical errors
[00:03:17.721 --> 00:03:20.723]  Uh, claim 251,000 lives every year.
[00:03:20.763 --> 00:03:24.345]  That's more than respiratory disease, accidents, stroke, and Alzheimer's.
[00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:36.231]  Now, the professor that led this study said that the category includes everything from bad doctors to communication breakdowns when patients are handed off from one department to another.
[00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:40.533]  And he goes on to say that this calculation of 251,000 deaths per year equates to nearly 700 deaths a day.
[00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:55.380]  But John Rappaport goes on in this article to point out how the Centers for Disease Control doesn't even require reporting of medical errors in the data that it collects about deaths through billing codes.
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.101]  So that makes it harder to see what's really going on at the national level.
[00:03:59.601 --> 00:04:06.084]  And something else that's also overlooked is the number of severe patient injuries resulting from medical error.
[00:04:06.504 --> 00:04:10.246]  Some estimates put this number at 40 times the death rate.
[00:04:10.686 --> 00:04:16.149]  So, if you take that figure, 40 times the death rate would give us every year in the U.S.
[00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:21.232]  there are 10 million severe injuries as a result of medical errors.
[00:04:21.352 --> 00:04:25.775]  And then, of course, the CDC is completely in the dark on the third leading cause of death.
[00:04:26.415 --> 00:04:33.139]  And this, of course, is the agency that keeps continually telling all of us that vaccines are completely safe and effective.
[00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:38.042]  Don't worry about any medical errors or any severe injuries that might result from that.
[00:04:38.602 --> 00:04:50.554]  And this is of course, you know, the argument you're going to hear from many people that want to talk back at you if you are curious about what might be causing autism and perhaps the link there with vaccines.
[00:04:50.994 --> 00:05:00.624]  Just let them know that the experts represent a system that kills 3 million Americans per decade and severely injures 100 million Americans.
[00:05:00.984 --> 00:05:07.048]  So, you know, for more on those explosive figures, make sure to go to the breakdown of that article at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:07.388 --> 00:05:10.030]  Now, Dr. Toni Bark was on the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.372]  That's Billy Corgan's doctor, actually, and he said you've got to get her on.
[00:05:13.812 --> 00:05:25.760]  And she was on the show talking about the benefits of medicinal cannabis, but also the CDC's autism cover-up, and she goes in-depth into the effects of vaccine injury, as well as how to reverse them.
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.262]  So that's going to be coming up in one of the next segments.
[00:05:29.042 --> 00:05:30.242]  Stick around for that.
[00:05:30.643 --> 00:05:37.365]  But now Judicial Watch's FOIA lawsuit has uncovered even more Hillary Clinton emails that she withheld from the State Department.
[00:05:37.725 --> 00:05:51.349]  So this completely contradicts some statements that Hillary Clinton made that as far as she knew, all of her government emails were turned over to the State Department and that she did not use her ClintonEmail.com system until March 18, 2009.
[00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.034]  So these documents predate that, and they go back as far as January.
[00:05:58.334 --> 00:06:02.378]  They weren't turned over by Clinton to the State Department from her non-government server.
[00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:10.125]  The emails cover topics such as her schedule and travel plans, criticisms of Clinton by Richard Gere, Afghanistan, U.S.
[00:06:10.185 --> 00:06:18.053]  financial aid and security concerns for several Pacific islands, the recommendation for a health care system overhaul, and food security.
[00:06:18.513 --> 00:06:26.955]  Now, despite suggestions that Clinton said she turned over all emails dated March 18, 2009, here were some other emails that she failed to turn over.
[00:06:27.315 --> 00:06:40.878]  It includes some talk about her friends at Planned Parenthood, a call to Bill Clinton's former National Security Advisor, and of course, the late Sandy Berger, who was convicted of illegally removing classified documents from the National Archives.
[00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:43.099]  Hmm, no problems there.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:53.167]  So of course these emails further undermine her statement under penalty of perjury that suggested she turned over all of her government emails to the State Department.
[00:06:53.187 --> 00:06:56.169]  This is according to Judicial Watch's President Tom Fitzgerald.
[00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:56.650]  I don't know.
[00:07:18.712 --> 00:07:22.493]  Correspondence to the close Clinton family confidant, Sidney Blumenthal.
[00:07:22.953 --> 00:07:31.375]  Well, he was extradited to the US just as reports were coming in that the FBI was investigating Clinton's email server.
[00:07:31.895 --> 00:07:35.355]  So, here's an interesting question to pose.
[00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:41.737]  NBC, they were now the second major news network to announce an upcoming interview with the hacker.
[00:07:42.237 --> 00:07:47.758]  But, curiously, they held on to some explosive revelations for weeks.
[00:07:48.118 --> 00:07:48.499]  I don't know.
[00:08:03.576 --> 00:08:06.718]  Why did they hold on to this for weeks?
[00:08:06.878 --> 00:08:09.680]  Here's a little bit of the transcript with Cynthia McFadden.
[00:08:10.081 --> 00:08:14.984]  She says, when Hillary Clinton says that her server is absolutely safe, you're laughing.
[00:08:15.404 --> 00:08:18.146]  And Guccifer goes on to say that's a lie.
[00:08:18.326 --> 00:08:19.087]  It's not safe.
[00:08:19.247 --> 00:08:21.128]  It's not safe at all.
[00:08:21.609 --> 00:08:24.671]  So he's basically saying that, you know, I hacked into her
[00:08:25.331 --> 00:08:25.972]  I think so.
[00:08:51.295 --> 00:09:00.679]  There's a tremendous deal in the works and an incentive for Guccifer to negotiate with the FBI and become a witness for the government against Mrs. Clinton.
[00:09:01.079 --> 00:09:07.042]  And he goes on to say that proof of hacking would make it nearly impossible not to charge Hillary.
[00:09:07.702 --> 00:09:16.426]  So this, of course, is the answer to that question of why did NBC, the Clinton media cover-up, why'd they hold on to that explosive interview?
[00:09:16.666 --> 00:09:17.427]  And here's why.
[00:09:17.487 --> 00:09:23.490]  Because they don't want to ruin Clinton's chances of becoming the Democratic nominee and, of course, the President.
[00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:35.200]  And a lot of people are saying, you know what, hold up, because it's not going to be just the Republican convention that's going to be contested, but Bernie Sanders might be well equipped to upend the Democratic convention as well.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:46.950]  And, you know, he's probably not going to win the delegates that he needs to beat Clinton, but he's definitely going to have a sizable presence at the convention, which means that he could shape the Democratic Party's rules.
[00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.912]  And their platform to include some of his top priorities.
[00:09:51.332 --> 00:09:53.494]  But Clinton, you know, she said, it's fine.
[00:09:53.534 --> 00:09:58.116]  We're going to talk about his priorities because they have the same goals.
[00:09:58.376 --> 00:09:58.777]  Hmm.
[00:09:59.377 --> 00:09:59.757]  Of course.
[00:09:59.817 --> 00:10:10.744]  And someone else who also shares the same goals and agenda as Hillary Clinton, surprisingly, is House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has come out and said that he won't be backing Trump over Hillary.
[00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:13.825]  He wants someone that's going to unite the parties.
[00:10:14.186 --> 00:10:15.807]  Well, it's no surprise because
[00:10:16.667 --> 00:10:20.431]  He has functionally the same positions as Hillary Clinton.
[00:10:20.511 --> 00:10:26.456]  He supports more foreign migration, more foreign trade, and more foreign military engagements.
[00:10:26.737 --> 00:10:35.144]  Now Trump's spokesperson came out and said that he really shouldn't even be the representative there then if he can't get behind the party's nominee.
[00:10:36.562 --> 00:10:39.963]  And of course, as I've been away on vacation, a lot of stuff has happened.
[00:10:40.023 --> 00:10:41.544]  Ted Cruz and Kasich dropped out.
[00:10:42.064 --> 00:10:49.726]  Donald Trump, of course, named a former Goldman partner and Soros money manager as his finance chairman.
[00:10:49.767 --> 00:10:51.407]  So that, of course, raised some red flags.
[00:10:51.947 --> 00:10:58.409]  And so after that fumble, he has now hired a pro-life advocate as his top domestic policy director.
[00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.270]  This is John Mashburn.
[00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:05.532]  And so this might serve those people who say that Donald Trump isn't conservative enough.
[00:11:06.312 --> 00:11:09.875]  And we had Washington insider Roger Stone on the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:11:09.955 --> 00:11:16.401]  He was breaking down some new insights in what the Trump campaign's next move might be, including who could be the VP.
[00:11:17.602 --> 00:11:20.485]  What about VP?
[00:11:20.545 --> 00:11:24.708]  So many folks are saying get the governor, the former governor of Oklahoma, who's a woman.
[00:11:24.988 --> 00:11:26.710]  I'm not for gimmicks, but she's a great lady.
[00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:30.814]  Wouldn't that be a good coup against Hillary's, you know, female vote claim?
[00:11:31.974 --> 00:11:40.680]  Well, you know, one thing that President Richard Nixon once told me was, when looking for a running mate, don't try to find somebody who can help you.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.762]  You'd be lucky to find somebody who doesn't hurt you.
[00:11:44.422 --> 00:11:54.649]  That is, of course, ironic in view of the fact that both of the running mates that he chose, Spiro Agnew and Henry Cabot Lodge, turned out to be disasters that hurt him in the 1968 and the 1960 campaigns.
[00:11:57.251 --> 00:11:59.093]  I think you can get too clever here.
[00:11:59.593 --> 00:12:10.002]  The good news is that Donald Trump, without the prospect of a contested convention, has much, much broader latitude in who he chooses.
[00:12:10.482 --> 00:12:17.368]  He doesn't have to go check the boxes, pick a woman, pick a Hispanic, pick a career politician.
[00:12:18.048 --> 00:12:27.834]  And therefore, I got the impression, and he holds this very close to his vest, that he is going to look at a broad cross-section of people that perhaps we haven't considered yet.
[00:12:28.334 --> 00:12:32.997]  Now, you do have to be cognizant of the need for vetting.
[00:12:33.857 --> 00:12:43.583]  The only advantage of taking somebody who has run for president in the most recent cycle, a John Kasich, a Marco Rubio, is that they're fully vetted.
[00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:45.444]  I really don't get the impression
[00:12:46.064 --> 00:12:47.385]  That that is where he's headed.
[00:12:47.605 --> 00:12:55.309]  So when you say, because boy I'm salivating here for the exclusiveness of this, when you say he's looking into a section no one ever looked into, is that military?
[00:12:55.369 --> 00:12:56.069]  Is that industry?
[00:12:56.349 --> 00:12:58.070]  I mean, please tell us what that section is.
[00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:08.655]  Well, I think it could be military because when he said, I want somebody from the political system, I think what he actually meant was I need somebody who knows how the government runs.
[00:13:08.715 --> 00:13:12.297]  That didn't necessarily mean an elected politician.
[00:13:13.177 --> 00:13:15.278]  So it could be somebody from the military.
[00:13:15.298 --> 00:13:18.059]  I think that Trump is very, very shrewd.
[00:13:18.079 --> 00:13:27.223]  He understands that two business people on a ticket with no government experience is probably not the best prescription for government.
[00:13:27.343 --> 00:13:34.527]  And he wants somebody who can navigate the walls of government to implement his program over the objections.
[00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:37.268]  Sure, isn't Chris Christie geographically too close though?
[00:13:38.522 --> 00:13:42.967]  I think Chris Christie would be the wrong choice for a couple of reasons.
[00:13:43.007 --> 00:13:47.031]  First of all, the George Washington Bridge scandal is probably not over.
[00:13:47.491 --> 00:13:50.474]  The people charged in that scandal are going to go to trial shortly.
[00:13:50.855 --> 00:14:01.426]  There's also a very significant civil trial, and it remains to be seen until those two trials are over what Chris Christie's vulnerabilities may or may not be.
[00:14:02.026 --> 00:14:03.847]  Geographically, it doesn't make sense.
[00:14:04.788 --> 00:14:07.010]  I think it would send the wrong signal.
[00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.872]  I think Trump is thinking much broader than that.
[00:14:10.673 --> 00:14:12.034]  Now, we can all be surprised.
[00:14:12.594 --> 00:14:14.215]  Only he is going to make this choice.
[00:14:14.756 --> 00:14:16.997]  He's not a man who tips his hand in advance.
[00:14:17.558 --> 00:14:23.863]  But I think he's looking at a broad cross-section of people, not necessarily elected politicians.
[00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:42.005]  Heiko Maas, the German Federal Minister of Justice, got an earful of the voice of the German people while speaking at a May Day celebration.
[00:14:42.165 --> 00:14:46.148]  The German people chant, you leftist rat and traitor.
[00:14:49.251 --> 00:14:51.893]  Maas says, no, we're here to stay.
[00:14:52.033 --> 00:14:53.074]  We aren't going anywhere.
[00:14:54.822 --> 00:14:58.944]  The chants of TRAITOR and GET OUT become stronger and louder.
[00:14:59.244 --> 00:15:08.730]  But Moss fires back, threatening, We will also take care of the interests of those people shouting TRAITOR right now without even knowing what's happening to them.
[00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.593]  The chants continue as Moss says, Shout all you want.
[00:15:12.693 --> 00:15:15.234]  The longer you shout, the longer I shall stand here.
[00:15:15.574 --> 00:15:19.677]  Finally, he leaves the podium as they chant TRAITOR, GET OUT,
[00:15:25.137 --> 00:15:27.683]  Leaving the Germans to chant, we are the people!
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.243]  Heiko Maas, yet another arrogant globalist tool from the Merkel regime.
[00:15:35.403 --> 00:15:40.306]  The same man that introduced the 2015 law known as Data Stolen Goods.
[00:15:40.626 --> 00:15:50.733]  A law described by Berlin District Court Judge Ulf Boehmeyer as an anti-whistleblower law intended to deal a mighty blow to democracy and freedom of speech.
[00:15:51.013 --> 00:15:55.756]  Where in Germany, xenophobia and racism is now a punishable crime.
[00:15:55.956 --> 00:16:00.400]  Furthermore, Moss is now calling for a legal ban on sexist advertisements.
[00:16:00.661 --> 00:16:13.152]  Germany, well known for its liberal attitude towards adult entertainment, is now being forced to scale back its culture in order to appease the wishes of the growing Muslim refugee population exploding within Germany.
[00:16:13.312 --> 00:16:19.899]  Meanwhile, the German people are being held captive by the ungrateful foreign invaders and their own treasonous government.
[00:16:20.655 --> 00:16:23.277]  They come here and we're not allowed to go any further!
[00:16:23.297 --> 00:16:24.618]  Boy, boy, boy, you get out of here!
[00:16:24.638 --> 00:16:29.080]  The way he looks, as a single case, he's put back in a drawer of 20,000 others.
[00:16:43.913 --> 00:16:58.140]  William F. Jasper of the New American writes, the migration tsunami that swamped Europe with 1.5 million refugees in 2015 is roaring back with a tidal wave that may be double the size of last year's deluge.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:06.984]  In fact, most citizens of the European Union countries appear to be unaware that their unelected and unaccountable rulers at the European Commission
[00:17:07.384 --> 00:17:13.225]  And their own European Economic Forecast report issued last fall announced precisely that.
[00:17:13.426 --> 00:17:20.967]  That is, they projected with apparent acceptance and approval that 3 million refugee migrants would arrive in Europe in 2016.
[00:17:21.928 --> 00:17:22.968]  Time is running out.
[00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:26.769]  The globalists have all but achieved their soft invasion of Europe.
[00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:31.390]  And that planned gridlock of civilization is heading in your general direction.
[00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:42.158]  As I speak, thousands of unvetted refugees are filing into small towns across the United States via what will be known later as a broken vetting process.
[00:17:42.458 --> 00:17:47.602]  A process that should have taken two years has now been reduced to a few pointless months.
[00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:51.585]  It's Obama's turn, and he aims to match Merkel's numbers.
[00:17:52.245 --> 00:18:02.808]  How do you think the President would explain to Mrs. Merkel about his inability to have that happen here in the United States when Germany's taken in close to a million people?
[00:18:03.508 --> 00:18:10.250]  Well, again, I think the President, when he travels to Germany, will be prepared to tell her that he's prepared to meet the goal.
[00:18:12.692 --> 00:18:17.495]  It seems like it might be a little embarrassing to not be able to get 10,000 people into your country.
[00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:19.876]  I'm not willing to say that we're not going to hit the goal.
[00:18:20.177 --> 00:18:22.118]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:18:44.522 --> 00:18:47.083]  This is an American President.
[00:18:47.423 --> 00:18:51.284]  Just add puppet, then vote and repeat every four years.
[00:19:04.889 --> 00:19:09.311]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.451 --> 00:19:12.052]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.769 --> 00:19:15.769]  And to look at that threat, we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:27.192]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type one civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.852 --> 00:19:39.214]  You can say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.742 --> 00:19:50.145]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.

[00:23:03.407 --> 00:23:10.709]  Well, a lot of people have been really concerned about the amount of earthquakes that have been happening all over the world, as well as volcanic eruptions.
[00:23:11.009 --> 00:23:19.271]  Well, beginning on March 14, 2016, there have been a number of small magnitude earthquakes occurring beneath Mount St.
[00:23:19.432 --> 00:23:20.752]  Helens here in the U.S.
[00:23:21.412 --> 00:23:32.479]  Over the last eight weeks, there have been over 130 earthquakes that was formerly located by the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, and many other earthquakes were too small to be located.
[00:23:32.899 --> 00:23:44.247]  And now they are saying that this is probably likely because the magma chamber is slowly recharging, and as the stress drives fluid through cracks, it produces these small quakes.
[00:23:44.667 --> 00:23:53.170]  And so far they say, you know, there's nothing to worry about because this current pattern of seismic activity is similar to the swarms that were seen at Mount St.
[00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.671]  Helens in 2013 and 2014.
[00:23:56.151 --> 00:24:07.316]  But over the past couple of months, major earthquakes have shaken areas all over the planet and major volcanoes have also been erupting with a frequency that's a little bit more than startling.
[00:24:07.856 --> 00:24:13.857]  Well, of course, we've seen in Oklahoma they've absolutely shattered their record for quakes last year.
[00:24:14.538 --> 00:24:20.139]  And we also saw a really disturbing earthquake take place right there along the New Madrid Fault.
[00:24:20.759 --> 00:24:28.281]  And one scientist is now saying that the San Andreas Fault in Southern California looks like it's locked, loaded, and ready to go.
[00:24:28.641 --> 00:24:29.721]  This is Thomas Jordan.
[00:24:30.061 --> 00:24:32.662]  He's the director of the Southern California Earthquake Center.
[00:24:33.567 --> 00:24:34.468]  And this is out of an L.A.
[00:24:34.488 --> 00:24:35.288]  Times article.
[00:24:35.348 --> 00:24:38.950]  He says, the springs on the San Andreas system have been wound very, very tight.
[00:24:39.471 --> 00:24:44.073]  And the southern San Andreas Fault, in particular, looks like it's locked, loaded, and ready to go.
[00:24:44.654 --> 00:24:48.996]  And, of course, that San Andreas Fault is way overdue for a big quake.
[00:24:49.096 --> 00:24:51.938]  So we're talking about a truly historic event here.
[00:24:52.438 --> 00:25:01.864]  And according to the Daily Mail, they're also saying that it's not just California we need to be concerned about, but that giant chunks of the Earth's mantle are breaking off
[00:25:02.344 --> 00:25:05.726]  And sinking into the planet under the North American plate.
[00:25:05.786 --> 00:25:13.529]  And this, of course, could explain why we've been seeing this record number of earthquakes in the eastern part of the country in recent years.
[00:25:13.589 --> 00:25:16.191]  So, of course, that's a rather ominous warning there.
[00:25:16.871 --> 00:25:22.834]  But if you're really interested in this, check out David Knight's in-depth report that he did on the Alex Jones Channel.
[00:25:22.894 --> 00:25:26.796]  It's titled, Experts Reveal Yellowstone Supervolcano Unpredictable.
[00:25:29.508 --> 00:25:36.990]  On Saturday, September 27, 2014, at noon local time in Japan, Mount Ontake suddenly exploded without warning.
[00:25:37.231 --> 00:25:39.651]  Many hikers and tourists were on the mountain at the time.
[00:25:40.071 --> 00:25:43.913]  One person tweeted a picture of the top of the volcano moments before it erupted.
[00:25:44.113 --> 00:25:46.013]  Over 30 people are now feared dead.
[00:25:46.373 --> 00:25:49.374]  Japan is a very active area for earthquakes and volcanoes.
[00:25:49.474 --> 00:25:57.337]  It's closely monitored, continuously monitored, yet it underscores that scientists still don't understand volcanoes well enough to predict them accurately.
[00:25:57.697 --> 00:26:02.322]  Mount Ontake shows that we won't always get months of warning like we did with Mount St.
[00:26:02.342 --> 00:26:04.344]  Helens before a volcano explodes.
[00:26:04.685 --> 00:26:13.614]  And if recent research papers are correct, supervolcanoes like Yellowstone could explode suddenly, without warning, without seismic movement signaled as earthquakes.
[00:26:14.215 --> 00:26:24.198]  When we think of an explosive volcanic eruption, we imagine it being preceded by earthquakes, by ground swelling, by the mountain venting some hot gas, perhaps even some lava.
[00:26:24.798 --> 00:26:28.919]  These are the signs we look for in the inexact science of volcanic predictions.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:40.143]  But two research papers, published on the very same day this year, say that predicting supervolcano eruptions is even more difficult than predicting the eruptions of regular volcanoes.
[00:26:40.723 --> 00:26:49.400]  More on that in a moment, but first, do the events in Yellowstone earlier this year demonstrate changes that may be building toward an eruption?
[00:26:50.236 --> 00:26:53.017]  We did have an earthquake of 4.8 magnitude.
[00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:56.899]  Now that is the largest we've had in Yellowstone in over 30 years.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:01.622]  And a couple of months later shuts down a road that's melted because of increased ground temperature.
[00:27:02.182 --> 00:27:04.783]  People start to get edgy about an impending eruption.
[00:27:05.384 --> 00:27:09.146]  I went to Yellowstone recently and geothermal activity is everywhere.
[00:27:09.166 --> 00:27:15.369]  A reminder that you're on top of a super caldera and magma dome, the largest on earth.
[00:27:15.905 --> 00:27:21.070]  Frankly, we are just a few miles above some really hot magma.
[00:27:21.591 --> 00:27:27.236]  That magma serves as the heat that fuels the geysers and hot springs and fumaroles in the park.
[00:27:27.977 --> 00:27:32.962]  It's that engine that allows for the unique things that we see here in Yellowstone.
[00:27:33.502 --> 00:27:35.925]  This is what the melted road looks like two months later.
[00:27:36.506 --> 00:27:42.132]  Yellowstone spokesman at the time said the road had turned to soup and that was widely reported even in the mainstream media.
[00:27:42.573 --> 00:27:47.379]  But when I spoke to a ranger there, she dismissed it as simply a bad asphalt job.
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.961]  No, no it has nothing to do with that.
[00:27:53.261 --> 00:27:54.841]  That was just a couple of days.
[00:27:54.921 --> 00:27:57.082]  It was the asphalt was soft.
[00:27:57.502 --> 00:28:01.723]  It was actually a bad asphalt job that they had done the summer previous to that.
[00:28:02.263 --> 00:28:10.326]  And that combined with the intensity of the sun in the middle of the summer, and that it wasn't a hydrothermal area, that it just got soft.
[00:28:10.726 --> 00:28:11.026]  Oh, okay.
[00:28:11.106 --> 00:28:12.667]  And they just had to replace it.
[00:28:12.687 --> 00:28:16.250]  So it had nothing to do with an increase in geothermal activity in that area?
[00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:16.370]  No.
[00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:17.130]  The ground being hotter?
[00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:17.210]  No.
[00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:18.852]  It was just the asphalt, wasn't it?
[00:28:18.912 --> 00:28:22.794]  The asphalt, yeah, it was the combination of those things in that particular spot.
[00:28:22.894 --> 00:28:27.317]  I hadn't visited Firehole Lake Drive when I spoke to her, or I would have challenged what she told me.
[00:28:27.577 --> 00:28:29.699]  Two months later, the road still doesn't look good.
[00:28:30.239 --> 00:28:40.727]  But more importantly, Yellowstone's spokesman told the press at the time that people needed to stay away from the road because there was a high danger of stepping on seemingly solid soil into severely hot water.
[00:28:41.047 --> 00:28:49.493]  Contrary to what she said, Firehole Lake is an active geothermal area and you can see that the road deteriorates as it comes into proximity to geothermal features.
[00:28:49.874 --> 00:28:53.256]  But it's what we've come to expect from government employees at every level.
[00:28:53.657 --> 00:28:57.900]  Fear for their job if controversy erupts and contempt for the public's right to know.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:08.348]  If it was just a bad asphalt job heated up by the sun rather than increased ground temperature, then why are there other melted paved areas that they've just fenced off rather than try to fix?
[00:29:09.009 --> 00:29:13.212]  My suspicion is that the spots are so hot at the moment that they can't fix them.
[00:29:14.073 --> 00:29:17.736]  Ground temperature goes up and down with seismic activity in the park.
[00:29:18.216 --> 00:29:22.299]  We see between a thousand and three thousand earthquakes a year in Yellowstone.
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.562]  Most of them are so small nobody ever feels them.
[00:29:25.976 --> 00:29:30.438]  Swarms of small earthquakes that you can't even feel can cause the ground to go through major changes.
[00:29:30.578 --> 00:29:32.299]  Look at this area that was once a forest.
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:36.722]  The ground was a hospitable environment for trees to grow for a long period of time.
[00:29:37.242 --> 00:29:43.085]  Then in 1978, swarms of small earthquakes caused the ground in this area to rise to 200 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:29:43.905 --> 00:29:46.887]  It wasn't the quakes, but the heat that killed the trees.
[00:29:47.607 --> 00:29:53.851]  So while we may be heading into another period of increased activity in Yellowstone, it's far from the largest activity we've seen since it became a park.
[00:29:54.471 --> 00:29:59.173]  Of course, everyone will tell you that it's not if, but when the Supercaldera blows up.
[00:29:59.694 --> 00:30:02.215]  The difficulty, of course, is knowing when that's going to happen.
[00:30:02.715 --> 00:30:11.579]  Two research papers that were released on the same day this year, January 5, 2014, say that supervolcanoes aren't just bigger volcanoes.
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.141]  They have a completely different mechanism.
[00:30:14.781 --> 00:30:20.846]  The firing mechanism is a function of the buoyancy of the gigantic magma dome and the size of the dome.
[00:30:21.166 --> 00:30:24.789]  It makes it much more unpredictable than a regular volcano.
[00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:36.819]  And about the same time these research papers were saying that the eruption of a supervolcano was a function of magma dome size, we learned that Yellowstone's magma dome is two and a half times larger than they previously thought.
[00:30:36.839 --> 00:30:39.100]  55 miles long, 18 miles wide, 3 to 9 miles deep.
[00:30:42.403 --> 00:30:51.991]  For the sake of comparison, let's pretend for a moment that global warming predictions used to justify global taxation of man-made global warming are true.
[00:30:52.391 --> 00:31:00.278]  The IPCC's worst-case scenarios range from a 1 to 3 degree centigrade increase to a 2 to 6 degree centigrade increase.
[00:31:00.678 --> 00:31:02.860]  And that's over a 100-year period.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:11.087]  But if the Yellowstone supervolcano erupted, scientists say it could drop temperatures 10 degrees centigrade, that's about 18 degrees Fahrenheit, globally.
[00:31:11.707 --> 00:31:12.168]  We're good to go.
[00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.332]  That would be real climate change.
[00:31:33.512 --> 00:31:36.875]  And of course that would just be the temperature effect of a supervolcano eruption.
[00:31:37.196 --> 00:31:47.345]  There's also the devastation of the ash covering the ground and the massive explosion estimated to be 1,000 times the size of the Hiroshima nuclear bomb every second.
[00:31:47.884 --> 00:31:54.909]  The science of volcanic predictions is very new and unreliable at best.
[00:31:55.149 --> 00:32:01.694]  I think most of the ones that they think they'd be able to predict, they're thinking like maybe hours to days they'd be able to give people.
[00:32:01.934 --> 00:32:06.738]  This one, we think we know what we'd be looking for, and most of those are for little Mount St.
[00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:09.580]  Helens-style eruptions, which is little compared to this.
[00:32:10.199 --> 00:32:13.241]  Yes, the deadliest, most destructive volcanic eruption in U.S.
[00:32:13.261 --> 00:32:20.444]  history, where 57 people died, is a very tiny eruption compared to what could happen even with a partial eruption at Yellowstone.
[00:32:20.705 --> 00:32:21.085]  Mount St.
[00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:26.748]  Helens began in March 15, 1980, with a lot of earthquakes, over 100 in six days.
[00:32:27.168 --> 00:32:32.191]  Then a 4.2 magnitude earthquake, a little smaller than the 4.8 Yellowstone quake in April.
[00:32:32.531 --> 00:32:34.552]  Five days later, seven earthquakes.
[00:32:35.192 --> 00:32:38.173]  All over magnitude 4.0 in just one day.
[00:32:38.193 --> 00:32:41.354]  The next day, the first eruption with a plume of 7,000 feet.
[00:32:41.374 --> 00:32:47.337]  The volcano continued to erupt over several weeks and the plume rose to 20,000 feet.
[00:32:47.897 --> 00:32:55.059]  By April 17th, about a month after the volcano became active, a bulge began growing on the side of the mountain and began to grow at 5 to 8 feet per day.
[00:33:02.335 --> 00:33:11.519]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important area of InfoWars that runs the whole operation that is having such a big effect against the globalists.
[00:33:12.359 --> 00:33:19.983]  And I've said it over and over again, it is you the listeners and the viewers that send us the intel, the news tips, that support the broadcast, that spread the word.
[00:33:20.883 --> 00:33:23.984]  You are 90% of the operation or more.
[00:33:24.024 --> 00:33:27.166]  You don't stand beside us, you stand at the heart of InfoWars.
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.
[00:33:57.342 --> 00:34:05.626]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when products are sold out, you're unable to get them, sometimes for months, but we hold back the products for people that have already signed up for AutoShip.
[00:34:06.286 --> 00:34:17.391]  When you choose AutoShip before checkout on your order at Infowarshore.com, we'll give you 10% off and give you guaranteed delivery of out-of-stock products that are on your AutoShip list.

[00:34:21.033 --> 00:34:28.437]  Listers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products when you need them each month.
[00:34:29.474 --> 00:34:30.494]  Now it's finally here.
[00:34:30.954 --> 00:34:34.455]  AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:34:34.775 --> 00:34:35.255]  It's easy.

[00:34:42.937 --> 00:34:49.699]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, it's a sure win.
[00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:53.400]  You add to that free shipping on orders of $50, it is a can't lose.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:14.454 --> 00:37:18.575]  Alex Jones here to break down something that quite frankly you already know about.
[00:37:18.595 --> 00:37:23.557]  I'm just here to remind you of these important facts.
[00:37:24.277 --> 00:37:27.438]  But I'm also going to talk about something that some of you may not be aware of.
[00:37:27.458 --> 00:37:33.220]  And that's the fact that this is all being done on purpose by the Globalist Social Engineers.
[00:37:34.312 --> 00:37:36.034]  But what is the fact you're already aware of?
[00:37:36.595 --> 00:37:44.804]  For hundreds of years, if somebody's got a cold, or somebody's sick, or somebody's depressed, the old-time doctors would say, go out and get some sunshine.
[00:37:45.225 --> 00:37:46.146]  Go out for a walk.
[00:37:46.566 --> 00:37:47.347]  Go outdoors.
[00:37:47.447 --> 00:37:48.288]  Get out in nature.
[00:37:48.609 --> 00:37:49.450]  Get some fresh air.
[00:37:50.709 --> 00:38:04.254]  I've got a stack of articles over there on that desk with Stanford Research Institute and top psychology studies and information out of Russia and England, all these big reports coming out confirming what we already knew in common sense.
[00:38:05.614 --> 00:38:19.399]  You need to be out in the woods, out in nature, that you exercise better when you are, that you feel better, that your brain releases chemicals that increase brain activity and stimulate areas associated with fulfillment and spirituality.
[00:38:20.737 --> 00:38:29.642]  Our consciousness, our awareness, rises when we're out in the nature in which our species developed.
[00:38:30.223 --> 00:38:40.428]  When we're not, when we're indoors in artificial light, when we're looking at screens all day, it doesn't just rewire our brains as the studies show, it causes brain damage.
[00:38:41.009 --> 00:38:46.272]  And now we have whole generations immersed in this being brought up and the language is shrinking.
[00:38:47.232 --> 00:38:49.834]  The cognitive ability of the children is stunted.
[00:38:50.433 --> 00:39:03.340]  You add fluoride to the water and GMO and everything else, that's why modern industrial civilizations see giant spikes in brain damage, in neurological disorders, in cancer, in infertility.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:10.004]  It's not happening in rural areas in the third world where modern civilization has not come.
[00:39:11.257 --> 00:39:15.240]  Now it turns out the social engineers have known this for a long, long time.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:26.228]  They've known since the 20s that gut flora, because of pesticides and food being destroyed, doesn't allow the body to process, the bacteria to process in the gut, things like vitamin B12.
[00:39:27.308 --> 00:39:32.692]  Well, somebody who's 85 years old has very low levels of vitamin B12, naturally, because their absorption rate lowers.
[00:39:33.193 --> 00:39:34.554]  They're finding teenagers
[00:39:35.475 --> 00:39:43.199]  With the same level of vitamin B12 in their bodies as someone who's over 80 years old.
[00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:46.881]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a disaster.
[00:39:47.721 --> 00:39:58.867]  Our culture and civilization is falling apart and the system knows there's basic things like sunshine and fresh air and out in nature and vitamin B12 and vitamin C that we need.
[00:40:01.047 --> 00:40:08.231]  I know you know this information, but as info warriors, it's key for you to get this report and others, and get it out to everyone in your community.
[00:40:08.532 --> 00:40:10.133]  Not just, quote, those you love.
[00:40:10.633 --> 00:40:12.194]  Don't we really love everybody?
[00:40:12.734 --> 00:40:14.635]  Let's go look at some of these reports right now.
[00:40:16.156 --> 00:40:17.197]  Think about the facts.
[00:40:17.457 --> 00:40:20.219]  Years ago, we exposed this, but here it is in the Washington Post.
[00:40:20.739 --> 00:40:25.302]  Researchers, medical errors, now third leading cause of death in the U.S.
[00:40:25.967 --> 00:40:30.270]  But that's not counting things like flesh-eating bacteria and other issues.
[00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:33.753]  You add that together, it's the number one cause of death.
[00:40:33.773 --> 00:40:48.383]  And these are the very same people and the very same institutions that are telling you vaccines don't have any harmful side effects, even though the inserts admit they can cause hundreds of different disorders and death.
[00:40:49.123 --> 00:40:50.624]  These are the same people that never
[00:40:51.738 --> 00:40:53.198]  Ask, why are you depressed?
[00:40:53.659 --> 00:40:55.419]  Or why is cancer going way up?
[00:40:55.819 --> 00:41:02.021]  They just give you, quote, treatments that don't get rid of the underlying problem, but only mask it.
[00:41:02.621 --> 00:41:13.785]  And then they've got a bunch of big studies that have come out in major scientific journals dealing with the fact that going outside makes you healthier.
[00:41:14.225 --> 00:41:17.626]  That planting a garden, that turning your television off
[00:41:18.326 --> 00:41:28.275]  Is the answer but the power structure again does not want you to know this because they want you fully immersed inside their system.
[00:41:28.796 --> 00:41:36.623]  They want you fully immersed inside their false reality where they can feed you the ideas and the information.
[00:41:37.606 --> 00:41:40.728]  They want you to get, because the globalists are mad scientists.
[00:41:40.748 --> 00:41:42.649]  They are playing God.
[00:41:43.189 --> 00:41:46.491]  But go read the new literature out of Stanford Research.
[00:41:46.552 --> 00:41:53.276]  Go read the new literature out of the major psychological publications that are all saying the same thing.
[00:41:53.336 --> 00:41:55.897]  Now, let's look at this information.
[00:41:56.558 --> 00:42:00.300]  All that screen time is bad for your children, remember.
[00:42:01.038 --> 00:42:06.742]  That the founder of Apple, before he died, Steve Jobs said, I don't let my kids use the computer.
[00:42:06.762 --> 00:42:07.703]  In fact, here's one of those articles.
[00:42:08.043 --> 00:42:18.691]  I don't let my kids have an iPad because we know screen time lowers IQ, lowers brain connections, dumbs people down, and basically turns them into jellyfish.
[00:42:19.032 --> 00:42:19.612]  Gray matter.
[00:42:20.072 --> 00:42:21.894]  Too much screen time damages brain.
[00:42:21.934 --> 00:42:25.597]  Well, the truth is, it's not too much screen time, it's basically any.
[00:42:26.057 --> 00:42:28.579]  So some people will ask me, why are you then on TV?
[00:42:29.264 --> 00:42:40.630]  Well, we're going into the system that's causing the problems to basically try to warn people, like a warning on the bottle, that they should be aware of the quote, side effects.
[00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:45.892]  The side effects that are much worse than what you're supposedly getting from this system.
[00:42:45.932 --> 00:42:51.095]  In fact, if you have to, don't watch the television, turn away and use it as a radio.
[00:42:51.595 --> 00:42:58.519]  Because in a moment, I'm going to talk about some of the ways you can actually boost your brain, not dumb your brain down.
[00:42:59.696 --> 00:43:03.400]  Since the time of the pharaohs, elites always think they're God and want to play God.
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:08.144]  And now because of advanced technology, this establishment has got what they think is a shot at it.
[00:43:08.785 --> 00:43:12.248]  They're horrible control freaks that are incredibly selfish and evil.
[00:43:12.768 --> 00:43:13.970]  But let's stop worrying about them.
[00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:15.391]  They're not going to change.
[00:43:15.691 --> 00:43:20.496]  Let's expose their systems, warn other good humans that care about freedom.
[00:43:21.385 --> 00:43:25.686]  and a care about consciousness and a care about free will and let's change the system.
[00:43:26.286 --> 00:43:30.347]  Spread the word about InfoWars.com and the articles that we publish showing this information.
[00:43:30.747 --> 00:43:39.148]  Support us by getting high-quality vitamin B12 that everybody needs at InfoWarsLife.com and other things like the good halogen, Survival Shield X2.
[00:43:39.729 --> 00:43:47.050]  The truth is God gave us Mother Nature with incredible natural weapons to counter what these horrible social engineers are doing.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:44:02.654]  But whether it's hiking with your children, killing your television, going out and getting some fresh air, getting some sunshine, whatever you do, realize that this modern system is killing us and it's being done by design.
[00:44:03.235 --> 00:44:05.577]  Some will ask, well why are you on television then?
[00:44:05.597 --> 00:44:06.398]  Why are you on radio?
[00:44:06.418 --> 00:44:07.119]  Why are you on the internet?
[00:44:08.126 --> 00:44:11.748]  Well, why is Neo and Morpheus in the Matrix jacking into the Matrix?
[00:44:12.348 --> 00:44:13.428]  Because that's where the fight is!
[00:44:14.189 --> 00:44:21.892]  We're here reaching in through the system's own conduit, trying to warn people because this is the dimension in which all the people are in!
[00:44:21.912 --> 00:44:26.994]  And then, of course, there's the aspect of, we are watching you.
[00:44:28.021 --> 00:44:48.950]  Trojan horse systems of surveillance by design have been rigged in to all these new computer systems and smart devices to overcharge us on our electricity bills and track what we're watching and listening to to add it to the big algorithm actuary histories on us so AI systems can basically predict what we're going to do in the future to game our civilization.
[00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:53.532]  The establishment has broken the social contract with the people of the world.
[00:44:54.132 --> 00:44:56.133]  It's time that we become aware of that fact
[00:44:57.313 --> 00:45:01.455]  Understand we're under attack and do what humans do best.
[00:45:01.615 --> 00:45:03.255]  Resist dehumanization.
[00:45:03.755 --> 00:45:05.596]  It is the animating contest of liberty.
[00:45:06.276 --> 00:45:09.637]  We were meant to overcome threats in our environment.
[00:45:10.418 --> 00:45:13.979]  We have built an artificial environment for ourselves that has a lot of attributes.
[00:45:14.539 --> 00:45:22.162]  But behind it, hiding in it, in the complexity, is the tyranny of the social engineers of the eugenicist.
[00:45:22.822 --> 00:45:25.544]  This rabbit hole goes a lot deeper than what I've just told you here.
[00:45:25.945 --> 00:45:26.665]  You all know that.
[00:45:27.046 --> 00:45:35.733]  Let's explore this together, and let's expose what's happening, and consciously, with our decisions, and what we do, change the world we live in together.
[00:45:36.314 --> 00:45:44.021]  The human revolution against tyranny has just begun, and all of you are at the very front lines of this fight for human liberty.
[00:45:54.315 --> 00:45:57.817]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[00:45:57.877 --> 00:46:01.258]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[00:46:01.318 --> 00:46:06.141]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:46:06.161 --> 00:46:09.062]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[00:46:09.182 --> 00:46:15.125]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[00:46:15.325 --> 00:46:18.889]  They print our money and then loan it to us at interest.
[00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:21.933]  The IRS is their collection agency.
[00:46:22.033 --> 00:46:30.563]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[00:46:31.636 --> 00:46:40.341]  ...is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:46:40.442 --> 00:46:45.585]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[00:46:46.105 --> 00:46:49.727]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[00:46:49.867 --> 00:46:51.889]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:46:51.969 --> 00:46:54.390]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:56.832]  Know your history and you will know your enemy.
[00:46:57.192 --> 00:46:58.293]  InfoWars.com
[00:47:03.126 --> 00:47:07.451]  Get BrainForce at 25% off for a limited time at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:09.794]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.914 --> 00:47:16.701]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:47:16.941 --> 00:47:20.225]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.245 --> 00:47:21.406]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.707 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:53.016]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[00:47:55.759 --> 00:47:56.920]  And we thank you for your support.
[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.701]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.

[00:48:47.023 --> 00:48:53.686]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.

[00:49:13.745 --> 00:49:16.667]  And Dr. Bark, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[00:49:16.687 --> 00:49:19.889]  You heard me kind of set the table there for folks that just tuned in.
[00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:25.553]  Some of the news, we're going to break in five minutes, but first off, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:49:26.294 --> 00:49:31.438]  But what is front and center for you today with all the changes that are happening?
[00:49:32.059 --> 00:49:34.161]  Well, I do see the tide turning somewhat.
[00:49:34.221 --> 00:49:39.645]  Yesterday, I was an expert witness in a Midwestern state in family court.
[00:49:39.865 --> 00:49:42.007]  This is something that I've done many times.
[00:49:42.207 --> 00:49:44.529]  This is regarding vaccine custody issues.
[00:49:44.849 --> 00:49:46.290]  I've done it in Australia as well.
[00:49:46.991 --> 00:49:51.174]  I've worked on cases in Canada, and I have a case in the vaccine
[00:49:54.855 --> 00:50:16.224]  I mean, the judge yesterday was fascinated with hearing what I had to say about the lack of vaccine safety, about the court, and the opposing physician was unaware of the vaccine court, unaware of VAERS reporting, was not aware of how to recognize a vaccine damage.
[00:50:16.244 --> 00:50:18.185]  And this is exactly what we see, is that
[00:50:18.985 --> 00:50:23.748]  While the government set up this system in 86, and it was 14 shots we were pushing at that time, 14.
[00:50:23.909 --> 00:50:37.598]  We are up to, by the age of five, we are up to 49 doses in some states, in some states it's 63, in some states it's more if they push an annual flu shot or the nasal inhalant for under six years of age.
[00:50:37.939 --> 00:50:44.864]  And then in some states it's even more because we're seeing Gardasil, while it's not on any state mandate other than Rhode Island,
[00:50:46.144 --> 00:50:49.606]  It is being pushed heavily at the doctor's office.
[00:50:49.906 --> 00:50:52.567]  So I see more bills coming down the road.
[00:50:52.627 --> 00:50:58.829]  We know there's something called Healthy People 2020, which is for adults and it's tied to the Department of Transportation.
[00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:01.551]  That's really freaking scary.
[00:51:01.571 --> 00:51:08.313]  That means, oh, you know, Mr. Jones, you haven't, we don't know that you've been vaccinated in the last 10 years.
[00:51:08.353 --> 00:51:09.514]  You can't get on this flight.
[00:51:10.074 --> 00:51:15.641]  You need to step out of the line and go get MMR, OPV, IPV, DPT.
[00:51:15.701 --> 00:51:16.101]  That's right.
[00:51:16.282 --> 00:51:17.043]  God knows what else.
[00:51:18.527 --> 00:51:20.629]  That's what's going on.
[00:51:20.769 --> 00:51:27.635]  As dystopic a face I try to put on things, I get an expert like you on Dr. Bark, and then I start realizing all the horrible stuff I forgot to say.
[00:51:28.036 --> 00:51:43.129]  They want this as a right to travel to supposedly medicalize us, and this is a whole military-industrial big pharma complex that's been caught in thousands of, in many cases, lethal, secret testing on the general public.
[00:51:43.209 --> 00:51:44.611]  Why would we trust anything
[00:51:45.191 --> 00:52:02.115]  That big pharmaceutical companies like Bayer, who for a decade knowingly had HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C in their factor VIII blood product and in their own court cases, mainstream news, even NBC News came out and said, they said screw it, keep selling it, who cares if we kill people.
[00:52:02.435 --> 00:52:04.936]  I mean, you talk about an arrogant group of evil folks.
[00:52:05.762 --> 00:52:06.703]  Congress allowed them.
[00:52:06.723 --> 00:52:17.017]  It was illegal for them to sell the HIV-tainted Factor VIII in the States, but Congress passed something at the 11th hour, literally at the 11th hour.
[00:52:17.037 --> 00:52:18.980]  It was like midnight on a Christmas Eve.
[00:52:19.701 --> 00:52:20.021]  Canada.
[00:52:20.742 --> 00:52:27.785]  Yeah, and they were allowed to sell it to Spain, Portugal, and I believe France or Japan.
[00:52:28.206 --> 00:52:33.988]  And then about 15,000 people developed HIV from the tainted Factor VIII, and there were lawsuits.
[00:52:34.028 --> 00:52:35.589]  But you know, it's the price of doing business.
[00:52:35.649 --> 00:52:39.931]  I mean, the amount they had to pay out is nothing compared to what they made on selling all this stuff.
[00:52:39.951 --> 00:52:45.054]  And let's be clear, the executive's minutes have been public from the criminal trials in France and Australia and other areas.
[00:52:45.854 --> 00:52:48.536]  It came out that they knew it had HIV and hepatitis.
[00:52:48.596 --> 00:52:48.816]  Absolutely.
[00:52:48.836 --> 00:52:53.220]  It was a death sentence to basically anyone that took it with the HIV and they did it.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.522]  Folks, these are sick people.
[00:52:55.562 --> 00:52:56.262]  Please continue, Doctor.
[00:52:57.103 --> 00:52:58.684]  Yeah, so I mean that's one example.
[00:52:58.704 --> 00:53:03.608]  You know, there's many examples like the SV40 tainted polio vaccine.
[00:53:03.628 --> 00:53:04.328]  Cancer virus.
[00:53:04.749 --> 00:53:05.289]  Exactly.
[00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:07.511]  And that was the 40th simian virus.
[00:53:07.591 --> 00:53:09.793]  You know, we don't even talk about the other 39.
[00:53:10.773 --> 00:53:14.496]  But you know, the government knew that they were aware that SV40 was
[00:53:15.837 --> 00:53:25.184]  Contaminating that polio vaccine and what they said to the two, I believe it was Cutter that was first making it and then a few other companies was that, you know, we'll allow you to sell off this lot.
[00:53:25.224 --> 00:53:30.729]  You've got till you've got a few more years to sell this off and then we want you to start over.
[00:53:31.169 --> 00:53:38.435]  Well, there's actually so first of all, that's egregious and nefarious and then there's evidence that it was in tainting the vaccines as late as 1997.
[00:53:40.919 --> 00:53:43.325]  Well, you've done so much amazing work.
[00:53:43.346 --> 00:53:47.918]  When you testify to Congress or the Senate, I know you try to crystallize the info down, but...
[00:53:48.795 --> 00:53:54.178]  We've got the CDC documents, as you know, from 2000, where they had the CDC's like, I'm not going to let my grandkids have this.
[00:53:54.518 --> 00:53:55.198]  What are we going to do?
[00:53:55.239 --> 00:53:56.239]  We got to cover this up.
[00:53:56.719 --> 00:53:58.540]  But they never fixed it.
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:53:59.541]  It's only gotten worse.
[00:53:59.881 --> 00:54:01.802]  Now there's more vaccines they want to take.
[00:54:02.402 --> 00:54:08.626]  I mean, as autism goes from, you know, one in 30,000 to one in 58, they're talking about one in three within a decade.
[00:54:09.066 --> 00:54:16.830]  There's got to be a point where they know the epidemic is going to be so bad that they're going to end up getting brought down or they just kicking the can down the road, doctor.
[00:54:17.421 --> 00:54:25.567]  No, I mean, if you think about it, the healthcare system, the whole system in the United States is the largest growing business.
[00:54:26.027 --> 00:54:28.069]  It's the largest growing field in the whole world.
[00:54:28.169 --> 00:54:37.356]  I mean, exponential, you know, between CVSs on every corner, between hospitals growing and new medical centers and urgent cares everywhere.
[00:54:37.736 --> 00:54:39.457]  This is an exploding field.
[00:54:39.558 --> 00:54:41.999]  And so they see it as a win-win.
[00:54:42.079 --> 00:54:43.681]  I mean, if more people are sick,
[00:54:44.321 --> 00:54:53.446]  You know, if we can manage to not kill people but just really damage them so they have chronic illness, then the drug companies make a lot of money, the hospitals make a lot of money.
[00:54:53.647 --> 00:54:59.150]  You know, these non-profit, quote-unquote, hospitals, they get away with so much bullshit.
[00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:04.473]  I mean, as far as I'm concerned, it's worse than the for-profits because they get federal tax money.
[00:55:04.553 --> 00:55:08.015]  They sell a can of Coke for $10, only get a dollar from insurance.
[00:55:08.055 --> 00:55:11.717]  So then they get federal funding for the $9 or, you know, an aspirin for $100.
[00:55:12.998 --> 00:55:16.179]  Or pap smear for $300 and the insurance company only pays $14.
[00:55:16.559 --> 00:55:18.480]  And then the rest, the federal government gives.
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:22.381]  So it's just like the military industrial complex, $700 billion a year here alone.
[00:55:22.942 --> 00:55:24.262]  Of course they're funding Al Qaeda.
[00:55:24.302 --> 00:55:25.623]  Of course they're funding terror groups.
[00:55:25.903 --> 00:55:35.106]  Because when the terror groups then attack, they then have an excuse to go into those countries and half the time, don't even target the actual group, they'll target somebody totally innocent like the Iraqi people.
[00:55:35.748 --> 00:55:37.389]  Well, you know, so this is a good example.
[00:55:37.449 --> 00:55:40.872]  So yesterday or the day before, yesterday I was testifying all day.
[00:55:40.952 --> 00:55:42.574]  So I was driving and testifying.
[00:55:42.614 --> 00:55:52.462]  But the day before I was posting something and I saw somebody was talking about how great carbs and he studies cardiovascular disease and he's saying the benefit of eating a carb diet.
[00:55:52.742 --> 00:55:54.944]  And I talked about ketogenic diets, you know, that I
[00:55:55.404 --> 00:55:57.065]  Put a lot of my patients into ketosis.
[00:55:57.125 --> 00:55:58.045]  It reverses cancer.
[00:55:58.065 --> 00:55:59.186]  It reverses diabetes.
[00:55:59.246 --> 00:56:02.007]  It reverses heart disease, even Alzheimer's.
[00:56:02.487 --> 00:56:05.629]  And he immediately attacked me and said, patients can die.
[00:56:05.689 --> 00:56:06.749]  It's deadly dangerous.
[00:56:06.969 --> 00:56:12.692]  I mean, this is coming out the same day that, you know, the whole industrial complex is admitting.
[00:56:13.112 --> 00:56:15.435]  That pharmaceuticals is the third leading cause of death.
[00:56:15.476 --> 00:56:18.340]  And I, by the way, think it's probably second or first leading cause of cause of death.
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:19.201]  And we can talk about that.
[00:56:19.281 --> 00:56:23.908]  But, you know, to say that it's dangerous, deadly dangerous to go into ketosis.
[00:56:23.928 --> 00:56:28.474]  This is one of the most out of control, mass killing industries ever.
[00:56:29.542 --> 00:56:33.025]  It's like Satan telling you if you read a Playboy, you might become Satan.
[00:56:33.085 --> 00:56:34.927]  I mean, it's just, it's totally insane.
[00:56:35.327 --> 00:56:37.550]  It's like Hitler saying, don't be mean to the Jews.
[00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:39.531]  In fact, get into that, doctor.
[00:56:39.551 --> 00:56:41.273]  Let's talk about the numbers because we find the same thing.
[00:56:41.553 --> 00:56:48.520]  It looks like medical neglect, medical problems, you know, mistakes and drugs are probably together the number one cause of death.
[00:56:48.922 --> 00:56:50.503]  Well, I see it a little differently.
[00:56:50.623 --> 00:56:53.066]  Those are very high numbers that cause death.
[00:56:53.126 --> 00:56:57.569]  But actually, if you really think about it, you know, I'll see a breast cancer patient, right?
[00:56:57.649 --> 00:57:00.132]  And then I take the history, because I spend two hours with all my patients.
[00:57:00.652 --> 00:57:04.876]  And the history could be that they were in rounds and rounds and rounds of antibiotics.
[00:57:05.669 --> 00:57:06.510]  Rounds of antibiotics.
[00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:13.254]  So, you know, we know that when you're on a lot of antibiotics, it alters your bottle flora.
[00:57:13.314 --> 00:57:20.439]  It also reduces your intra-hepatic, it increases intra-hepatic circulation of hormones without degrading them and detoxifying them.
[00:57:21.059 --> 00:57:28.944]  So it's possible that patient would have never had breast cancer if they weren't thrown antibiotics for every friggin sinus complaint, every friggin cold.
[00:57:29.245 --> 00:57:30.625]  You know, so it's worse than that.
[00:57:30.645 --> 00:57:34.268]  And then look at the vaccines that can possibly be contaminated with retroviruses.
[00:57:34.528 --> 00:57:35.168]  We know that.
[00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:38.391]  I mean, we know that there's contamination, prions, retroviruses.
[00:57:39.391 --> 00:57:44.512]  Passages, you know, they put the vaccines through passages through these varro cells and these longevity cell lines.
[00:57:45.012 --> 00:57:47.933]  And at certain passages, they're carcinogenic, they're oncogenic.
[00:57:48.293 --> 00:58:01.036]  So how do we know that a polio vaccine that somebody got in the 60s when they were a child, and now they're eating glyphosate on their food, that the combination is not increasing their risk for cancer?
[00:58:01.436 --> 00:58:03.576]  You know, especially then if they've had antibiotics thrown at them.
[00:58:03.656 --> 00:58:07.197]  So a lot of times when you hear patients die from complications of their disease,
[00:58:08.697 --> 00:58:10.778]  I believe that they actually died from the medications.
[00:58:11.599 --> 00:58:12.099]  Absolutely.
[00:58:12.119 --> 00:58:13.059]  Doctor, stay right there.
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:19.142]  I've got to say, I am so impressed with you because I've read so much literature, mainline studies.
[00:58:19.442 --> 00:58:24.344]  This stuff's really hidden out there, but I've never heard somebody move as fast as you and bring up so many key things.
[00:58:25.005 --> 00:58:30.727]  So hopefully, maybe stay the whole hour if you can because I want to get more into this with you and obviously have you back a lot.
[00:58:31.427 --> 00:58:35.409]  But Dr. Tony Barker is our guest, disease-reversal.com.
[00:58:35.789 --> 00:58:36.870]  Back up a little bit.
[00:58:37.450 --> 00:58:40.392]  And get into the viruses, the prions, folks.
[00:58:40.432 --> 00:58:44.213]  That's what is connected to Alzheimer's and other things that we know are in the vaccines.
[00:58:44.534 --> 00:58:46.715]  You got into immortal cell lines.
[00:58:47.075 --> 00:58:49.076]  This is all mainline science.
[00:58:49.716 --> 00:58:50.857]  Well, that's it for the show tonight.
