[00:00:20.188 --> 00:00:22.233]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.717]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.917 --> 00:00:25.842]  It is March 21st, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:44.573]  Tonight, the censorship summit has begun as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg meets with China's propaganda chief to create what they are calling a global internet governance system.
[00:00:44.973 --> 00:00:50.997]  Then, Obama's historic visit to Cuba includes a photo op with Che Guevara.
[00:00:51.437 --> 00:01:00.884]  Plus, a Tucson cop who attended a Donald Trump rally says the anti-Trump protesters are the most hateful people he's ever seen.
[00:01:00.945 --> 00:01:01.865]  Very, very shocking.
[00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:04.447]  I wasn't expecting what I saw.
[00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:12.774]  I had no idea that I was going to lead that event with the thought process and experience that I obtained.
[00:01:13.154 --> 00:01:17.177]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:17.618 --> 00:01:18.859]  I was a little nervous.
[00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.859]  I was watching my back.
[00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:22.853]  I don't know what these fools gonna do in here, man.
[00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:23.799]  They were crazy!

[00:03:03.991 --> 00:03:10.277]  Tonight we'll start with a hot-button issue, that being surveillance, censorship, and all types of things that are happening online.
[00:03:10.717 --> 00:03:15.502]  Now, domestically, we see groups like the FBI trying to break into things like Apple phones.
[00:03:15.582 --> 00:03:20.767]  Over the U.K., they say they want all technology to have some type of backdoor into it.
[00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:27.193]  And now we see that Zuckerberg is meeting with China's leaders trying to get Facebook over there in China.
[00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:29.335]  And it says Zuckerberg has
[00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:36.338]  Held a rare meeting with China's propaganda chief amid a crackdown by Beijing authorities to use the Internet.
[00:03:36.718 --> 00:03:50.865]  As that's for Facebook purposes, China has called for the creation of a global Internet governance system in cooperation between countries to regulate Internet use, stepping up efforts to promote controls that activists complain stifle free expression.
[00:03:51.545 --> 00:03:56.470]  And Facebook and other social media are banned in China, such as Twitter.
[00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.453]  Now, to be fair, you don't have to use Facebook.
[00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:01.014]  There are other platforms you can use.
[00:04:01.034 --> 00:04:03.697]  You can just choose to ignore social media altogether.
[00:04:03.717 --> 00:04:05.258]  So take this with a grain of salt.
[00:04:05.558 --> 00:04:16.589]  But at the same time, I think it's very disingenuous for these guys to promote it as a free, open comment when they're selling your information or letting the government use your information for their purposes.
[00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:24.835]  And to that point, they're also shutting down people's Facebook accounts, Twitter accounts, for whatever reason, because they may post something that's controversial.
[00:04:24.855 --> 00:04:32.160]  We've seen numerous reports of people having home visits by police officers or special agents, people even getting arrested.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.623]  I'm reminded of the story of the young man, I believe he came from the U.K.
[00:04:36.163 --> 00:04:41.207]  It was on Facebook or some social media saying that he's going to blow up the U.S., you know, as a kind of joke.
[00:04:41.747 --> 00:04:44.828]  Then he gets here, then he gets detained, and then sent back to the UK.
[00:04:44.848 --> 00:04:46.468]  They say, no, you're not going to come here and blow up our country.
[00:04:46.488 --> 00:04:48.049]  He's like, it was obviously a joke.
[00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:53.110]  On the flip side of that, you can look at groups like ISIS, who are free and open on social media.
[00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.051]  And they say they let them run on social media so they can monitor their activities.
[00:04:57.371 --> 00:05:00.792]  Meanwhile, they are recruiting people, sympathizers to their cause.
[00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:04.533]  So that definitely is a double-edged sword, but at the same time, you don't have to use it.
[00:05:04.913 --> 00:05:06.493]  So it's just something to be aware of.
[00:05:06.833 --> 00:05:09.194]  They continue to strive to get more and more
[00:05:09.634 --> 00:05:10.114]  We're good to go.
[00:05:10.134 --> 00:05:11.235]  We're good to go.
[00:05:11.255 --> 00:05:11.615]  We're good to go.
[00:05:11.635 --> 00:05:12.396]  We're good to go.
[00:05:12.416 --> 00:05:12.776]  We're good to go.
[00:05:12.816 --> 00:05:13.456]  We're good to go.
[00:05:13.476 --> 00:05:13.976]  We're good to go.
[00:05:13.996 --> 00:05:15.417]  We're good to go.
[00:05:15.437 --> 00:05:15.917]  We're good to go.
[00:05:15.937 --> 00:05:16.738]  We're good to go.
[00:05:16.778 --> 00:05:17.178]  We're good to go.
[00:05:17.218 --> 00:05:18.099]  We're good to go.
[00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:18.679]  We're good to go.
[00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:19.079]  We're good to go.
[00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.320]  We're good to go.
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.880]  We're good to go.
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.320]  We're good to go.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.141]  We're good to go.
[00:05:22.161 --> 00:05:22.701]  We're good to go.
[00:05:22.741 --> 00:05:23.181]  We're good to go.
[00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:23.842]  We're good to go.
[00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:24.542]  We're good to go.
[00:05:24.562 --> 00:05:25.062]  We're good to go.
[00:05:25.142 --> 00:05:26.103]  We're good to go.
[00:05:26.143 --> 00:05:26.903]  We're good to go.
[00:05:27.023 --> 00:05:28.304]  We're good to go.
[00:05:28.344 --> 00:05:28.784]  We're good to go.
[00:05:28.824 --> 00:05:29.945]  We're good to go.
[00:05:29.985 --> 00:05:30.505]  We're good to go.
[00:05:30.565 --> 00:05:31.566]  We're good to go.
[00:05:31.586 --> 00:05:32.126]  We're good to go.
[00:05:32.146 --> 00:05:32.486]  We're good to go.
[00:05:32.506 --> 00:05:32.947]  We're good to go.
[00:05:32.967 --> 00:05:33.347]  We're good to go.
[00:05:33.387 --> 00:05:33.947]  We're good to go.
[00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:34.627]  We're good to go.
[00:05:34.688 --> 00:05:35.388]  We're good to go.
[00:05:35.408 --> 00:05:35.548]  We're
[00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:38.790]  I don't know.
[00:05:58.208 --> 00:06:09.053]  Florida Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez Cantera said that the President's visit to Cuba was a photo op, and that since easing U.S.-Cuba relations more than a year ago, nothing has changed.
[00:06:09.714 --> 00:06:15.277]  In fact, just before Obama's arrival, more than 50 demonstrators were arrested in the streets of Havana.
[00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:23.921]  They're called the Ladies in White, and they are the wives and relatives of jailed anti-castle activists who march to mass each Sunday.
[00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:36.530]  It reminds me, they have a group here in Austin, I believe they're called the Ladies in Black, they meet on Wednesdays at the Capitol around noon or so, and they do a similar thing, but I think they more protest wars and things of that nature.
[00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:38.632]  So, it's not just people.
[00:06:39.352 --> 00:06:42.193]  A lot of people say, those are probably Trump supporters out there protesting Obama.
[00:06:42.213 --> 00:06:44.973]  They're protesting Obama in Cuba as well.
[00:06:45.013 --> 00:06:47.434]  Not everybody's happy about what's going on.
[00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:55.996]  And I think it is good to ease any type of tension with a foreign entity, whether it be Cuba, they can ease things in Russia or wherever else.
[00:06:56.036 --> 00:06:59.877]  I think that'd be a good deal, but not everybody's happy about the things that are going on.
[00:06:59.897 --> 00:07:03.258]  Like you said, it's just a photo op, said the Lieutenant Governor.
[00:07:03.658 --> 00:07:08.580]  And as we're talking about Obama, let's talk about Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:14.743]  We see Obamacare returns to the Supreme Court as religious charities fight contraception mandate.
[00:07:15.223 --> 00:07:27.368]  It says President Obama's signature health care law once again is coming before the Supreme Court, this time in a case involving nuns who say that the law's contraception mandate violates their religious freedom rights.
[00:07:28.268 --> 00:07:29.348]  And I do agree with this.
[00:07:29.668 --> 00:07:35.350]  When you talk about things like Obamacare, if you say you have to have it, and I run into these people saying, well you don't have to get it.
[00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.791]  I'm like, well I'm going to be penalized if I don't get it.
[00:07:38.131 --> 00:07:39.991]  So yeah, I do kind of have to have it.
[00:07:40.451 --> 00:07:46.673]  Or you know, it's like saying, you don't have to have the protection racket, but we're going to break your legs if you don't.
[00:07:47.213 --> 00:07:48.373]  It's the same deal.
[00:07:48.934 --> 00:07:49.974]  But when you talk about this,
[00:07:50.896 --> 00:07:56.781]  They're forcing, I guess in this case, a religious group to pay for contraception, something that goes against their religious beliefs.
[00:07:57.041 --> 00:08:01.265]  And you do have a freedom of religion in this country, even though people like to pretend like you don't.
[00:08:01.505 --> 00:08:05.148]  And they say, hey, it's against my religion to go with this.
[00:08:05.369 --> 00:08:07.190]  And beyond that, you want me to pay for it.
[00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:12.375]  And that's always the issue I have with people who talk about things like abortion and contraception.
[00:08:13.055 --> 00:08:15.556]  If you choose to have an abortion, I can't stop you.
[00:08:15.636 --> 00:08:20.718]  If you choose to live a lifestyle that requires contraception, I can't stop you from doing that either.
[00:08:20.758 --> 00:08:23.619]  But at the same time, I don't feel like I should have to pay for it.
[00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:26.480]  People say, well, keep your prayers out of my vagina, nuns.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:31.262]  Well, I'm pretty sure the nuns would appreciate you keeping your vagina out of their wallets in their purse bags.
[00:08:31.882 --> 00:08:33.663]  And I'm also on that.
[00:08:33.863 --> 00:08:35.163]  Just stay out of my money.
[00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:36.164]  You do what you want to do.
[00:08:36.244 --> 00:08:37.564]  I'll do what I want to do with my money.
[00:08:38.044 --> 00:08:39.105]  And that's always the issue.
[00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:42.366]  Because I run into these people and they talk about things like Planned Parenthood.
[00:08:42.406 --> 00:08:45.107]  I ran into this lady last week at South by Southwest.
[00:08:45.127 --> 00:08:46.047]  You don't want to talk on camera.
[00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:47.508]  She's a nice, sweet lady.
[00:08:47.568 --> 00:08:49.408]  I'm sure she had the best intentions in the world.
[00:08:49.488 --> 00:08:51.649]  She really believed that she was trying to help people.
[00:08:52.129 --> 00:09:02.353]  And I'm sure there are things, if you sat down and gave me the tell the tape of the activities that go on at Planned Parenthood, I'm sure there's some things there that I don't so much adamantly disagree with.
[00:09:02.653 --> 00:09:05.254]  But at the same time, they do have things like abortion.
[00:09:05.934 --> 00:09:13.078]  And when you think about the history of a Planned Parenthood founded by Margaret Sanger, who swapped awards back and forth with Adolf Hitler.
[00:09:13.378 --> 00:09:15.840]  I know people say when you bring up Hitler, the argument is over.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.221]  No, they were pen pals.
[00:09:17.261 --> 00:09:17.861]  They were buddies.
[00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:20.182]  This is very relevant to the conversation.
[00:09:20.202 --> 00:09:22.584]  She said she wants to destroy the black weeds.
[00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:27.867]  They set up all these Planned Parenthood facilities originally in predominantly black communities.
[00:09:27.907 --> 00:09:30.368]  They serve a whopping number of black people.
[00:09:30.688 --> 00:09:33.410]  I believe they had the story two, three years ago.
[00:09:34.284 --> 00:09:34.424]  That's
[00:09:50.981 --> 00:09:52.302]  You know, you have libertarian views.
[00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:53.803]  You should let people do whatever they want.
[00:09:54.203 --> 00:09:57.385]  You can do whatever you want as long as it doesn't personally affect me.
[00:09:57.525 --> 00:10:04.009]  And when you're taking money out of my wallet to pay for your hobbies or whatever else you're doing, pay for your contraception, that affects me.
[00:10:04.109 --> 00:10:08.652]  So no, that does, the libertarian argument does not apply in this particular case.
[00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:11.214]  They continue to fight.
[00:10:11.274 --> 00:10:11.935]  It's a big issue.
[00:10:11.955 --> 00:10:13.756]  It's a real big issue here in Texas.
[00:10:14.277 --> 00:10:15.437]  They shut down a lot of clinics.
[00:10:15.818 --> 00:10:17.419]  A lot of the clinics are being defunded.
[00:10:17.479 --> 00:10:19.300]  People are protesting in the streets.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.384]  They're trying to get you to sign petitions to say, hey, we need to keep this Obamacare strong.
[00:10:23.404 --> 00:10:26.466]  We need to keep the Planned Parenthood facilities active.
[00:10:26.486 --> 00:10:29.869]  And like I said, there may be things going on there that I don't have an issue with.
[00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:31.050]  But at the same time, the
[00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:35.434]  The 3% or whatever the number is that they continue to throw out about their abortion.
[00:10:35.814 --> 00:10:37.616]  Number one, that's their numbers.
[00:10:37.656 --> 00:10:38.837]  That's not an independent audit.
[00:10:38.857 --> 00:10:41.040]  That's what they tell you they want the numbers to be.
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:41.520]  But also...
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:51.024]  If it's only 3%, why don't you get rid of that 3% and 97% of your problems will go away overnight.
[00:10:51.064 --> 00:10:55.888]  The majority of the people who go out to these Planned Parenthood facilities and they protest, they're protesting abortion.
[00:10:56.188 --> 00:11:01.772]  They're not protesting that you give away free lollipops at the front desk or free pens at the giveaways.
[00:11:01.832 --> 00:11:07.696]  No, they're saying, hey, it's the abortion that's the issue here, so if you get rid of that, your problems may just go away on their own.
[00:11:08.817 --> 00:11:09.637]  Now let's talk about Trump.
[00:11:10.678 --> 00:11:12.398]  You know, my favorite person in the world.
[00:11:13.378 --> 00:11:18.420]  But Donald Trump, he's been coming under a lot of scrutiny lately.
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:30.863]  And like I said, I'm not a Trump supporter, but at the same time, you're threatening the guy's kids, you're sending packages of white powder to his children, you're showing up in Klan rallies, or you're dressing up like a Klan guy and going to his events.
[00:11:31.503 --> 00:11:33.365]  I don't think he was responsible for that.
[00:11:33.445 --> 00:11:36.487]  You know, you could dress up like a Klan guy or, you know, whatever.
[00:11:36.507 --> 00:11:39.089]  You could dress up like Adolf Hitler and go to a Hillary Clinton event.
[00:11:39.349 --> 00:11:42.552]  That doesn't mean the Nazis or that she endorses the Nazi Party.
[00:11:42.812 --> 00:11:44.333]  That's just people trying to get her go.
[00:11:44.833 --> 00:11:54.841]  And now we see that a cop, a black cop at that, went to a Trump rally and he said the anti-Trump protesters were the most hateful people that he had ever met.
[00:11:55.222 --> 00:11:58.104]  And he basically said he wanted to go out there and just hear what Trump
[00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:02.786]  Had to say from the man himself, because he understands that media distortions do happen.
[00:12:03.106 --> 00:12:04.607]  People take things out of context.
[00:12:04.647 --> 00:12:06.588]  So they have creative editing.
[00:12:06.928 --> 00:12:10.390]  You know, they will play one part of his soundbite, but not the whole thing.
[00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:14.112]  So he went out there to experience it for himself, and this is what he found out.
[00:12:15.083 --> 00:12:18.824]  They made an announcement and said, you are not to harm protesters.
[00:12:18.864 --> 00:12:20.985]  You are not to get in a physical altercation with them.
[00:12:21.706 --> 00:12:24.527]  Um, that the security staff will escort them out.
[00:12:24.947 --> 00:12:26.807]  These people were acting fools.
[00:12:27.168 --> 00:12:28.208]  Some of them were African.
[00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:31.189]  Most of them were African-Americans acting a fool.
[00:12:31.529 --> 00:12:43.314]  And I hope that there's a picture of this mother covering her kids ears and walking them away because these people are yelling F Donald Trump, sticking their fingers up and yelling and screaming Black Lives Matter.
[00:12:44.093 --> 00:12:50.694]  And as the violence at these rallies continues, we see that the RNC head has actually come out and said that there is plenty of blame to go around.
[00:12:51.054 --> 00:12:51.954]  And I do agree with this.
[00:12:52.614 --> 00:12:54.035]  I don't agree with everything the guy says.
[00:12:54.055 --> 00:12:59.896]  He says you have to vote or you have to run to be accepted into the Republican Party, but that's a misnomer.
[00:13:00.156 --> 00:13:12.538]  To focus on what he's saying here, when it comes to the increased violence at the campaign rallies, particularly those of the GOP front runner Donald Trump, he says that there is plenty of blame on both sides and everybody needs to denounce the violence.
[00:13:13.038 --> 00:13:21.567]  And he also blamed the media for their part in the spike of violence because the attention most news outlets give to the campaign trail chaos.
[00:13:21.747 --> 00:13:24.870]  And I believe that is a very true statement.
[00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:29.956]  You know, they always continue to show these things pretty much around the clock, whether they're for Trump or they're against Trump.
[00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.078]  There's a lot of these videos going around.
[00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:32.898]  We're good to go.
[00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.450]  Doing it to death, I guess you would say.
[00:13:59.091 --> 00:14:00.911]  But I do agree with the statement that he made here.
[00:14:00.931 --> 00:14:02.552]  He said the media is obsessed with it.
[00:14:03.332 --> 00:14:05.352]  I mean, not necessarily you guys at CBS.
[00:14:05.372 --> 00:14:06.312]  That's who he's talking to.
[00:14:06.412 --> 00:14:09.353]  But other shows have this stuff on a constant loop.
[00:14:09.773 --> 00:14:13.314]  I mean, they find an altercation and they play it 24-7.
[00:14:13.854 --> 00:14:14.955]  And I do agree with that.
[00:14:15.055 --> 00:14:19.856]  So you definitely have to be careful when you look at these things that are very sensitive, especially when race
[00:14:20.376 --> 00:14:24.938]  Comes into the mix, like we just saw with the last story, the officer there.
[00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.020]  He said, hey, they keep telling me Trump is this, they say he's that.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.422]  I just want to hear the man speak from his own mouth and listen to what he actually has to say.
[00:14:32.502 --> 00:14:39.986]  So I think if we have more people like that who would actually listen to the man and not just the selected soundbites, you can find your own opinion of him.
[00:14:40.387 --> 00:14:42.808]  And even listening to the guy, I don't agree with everything he says.
[00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:48.191]  I don't think he should be the next president of the United States, but I don't think he's as bad as people paint him to be.
[00:14:49.291 --> 00:14:54.654]  And somebody who may be actually worse than people are paying him to be, we got Kim over there in North Korea.
[00:14:55.195 --> 00:15:00.538]  And now he's shooting out his five short-range ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan.
[00:15:00.918 --> 00:15:06.021]  Now, if you didn't know, Kim is threatening to blow up Washington, D.C., as well as Seoul.
[00:15:06.742 --> 00:15:16.568]  And they say that South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff reported that the missiles were launched in northeastern North Korea and traveled approximately 125 miles before landing in the water.
[00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:24.595]  They say the latest launches appear to be part of North Korea's response to ongoing South Korean U.S.
[00:15:24.635 --> 00:15:28.959]  military drills it sees as a provocation in a rehearsal for an invasion.
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:39.310]  And in the past two weeks, North Korea has fired several short-range missiles and artillery shells into the sea and threatening, like I said, attacks against Washington.
[00:15:40.558 --> 00:15:47.462]  I'm not exactly sure what Kim has up his sleeve, but he's not really packing the best stuff for the job.
[00:15:47.502 --> 00:15:55.966]  So I don't know if this is just kind of like a cry for attention, or what exactly he thinks he's going to get out of fighting with the United States of America.
[00:15:56.326 --> 00:15:57.507]  He has issues with other people.
[00:15:57.547 --> 00:15:58.648]  He can handle those issues.
[00:15:58.668 --> 00:16:00.268]  Hopefully they can find some peaceful solution.
[00:16:00.288 --> 00:16:06.932]  But Kim, I don't think you're going to do too well if you've got the big ISIS hunters coming out there to tear you down.
[00:16:06.952 --> 00:16:08.673]  I don't think you're going to last too long with that one.
[00:16:09.215 --> 00:16:13.058]  Now, a guy who lasts a little bit longer than people thought he would, the Paris fugitive.
[00:16:13.099 --> 00:16:16.361]  And this is the guy who was on the run after the Paris attacks.
[00:16:17.002 --> 00:16:21.106]  And they say that he got more help from his friends and neighbors than he did ISIS.
[00:16:21.586 --> 00:16:34.257]  It says, after the attacks, security forces searched far and wide for the prime suspect who vanished after returning to Brussels, believing the Islamic State could have spirited him away to Turkey, Syria, or Morocco.
[00:16:35.259 --> 00:16:39.422]  It appears that Europe's most wanted man never left the Belgium capital.
[00:16:39.782 --> 00:16:42.124]  It reminds me of something I saw a few weeks ago.
[00:16:42.164 --> 00:16:48.929]  I was watching Better Call Saul and they had the episode where he was looking for a family who, you know, disappeared and they thought they got kidnapped.
[00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:53.412]  But long story short, the cop he went to for help said, you know, people don't like to leave home.
[00:16:53.472 --> 00:16:54.373]  They always stay around.
[00:16:54.793 --> 00:16:57.915]  And lo and behold, Saul found them, you know, camping out in the woods or something like that.
[00:16:58.295 --> 00:16:59.256]  It's a very common thing.
[00:16:59.316 --> 00:17:00.437]  People don't like to leave home.
[00:17:00.457 --> 00:17:02.759]  And just like the Paris attacker, we see this guy.
[00:17:03.599 --> 00:17:08.603]  AP, Army never searched for AWOL soldier accused of raping girls.
[00:17:09.144 --> 00:17:17.390]  Long story short, they found this guy, age 24, who had been accused of having relations with girls age 15 and 14, I believe.
[00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:21.273]  He's age 24, and they found him very close to his hometown.
[00:17:21.674 --> 00:17:29.240]  So I guess it's a psychological deal that people don't like to go too far from home, and I guess the guy's in custody now, and they will deal with him as they see fit.
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:30.320]  And lastly,
[00:17:31.499 --> 00:17:38.244]  You guys see a lot of privilege training, whether it's white privilege or male privilege or, you know, whatever privilege.
[00:17:38.564 --> 00:17:40.506]  And now they have training for Marines.
[00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:47.451]  All Marines forced to go through training to erase unconscious bias as women enter combat roles.
[00:17:48.311 --> 00:17:52.092]  Now, this is when they're not busy having the troops run around in high heels.
[00:17:52.552 --> 00:17:53.432]  I'm talking about the men.
[00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:55.453]  You dress up in high heels and run them around.
[00:17:55.733 --> 00:17:58.593]  I'm sure Putin and everybody else is just laughing their heads off about it.
[00:17:59.154 --> 00:18:03.315]  Now they're saying that we have to teach these guys not to be biased against the women.
[00:18:03.675 --> 00:18:13.017]  Meanwhile, they're saying that they have surveys out there and they found that two-thirds of male Marines and also one-third of female Marines oppose the idea of women in combat roles.
[00:18:13.357 --> 00:18:14.197]  I'm just the messenger.
[00:18:14.237 --> 00:18:17.698]  Stay tuned right after this break for more special reports.
[00:18:20.874 --> 00:18:27.853]  Most immigrants and you know a lot of crime does come from outside people that we can't control because they're in illegally but
[00:18:29.045 --> 00:18:30.886]  Let's worry about controlling that first.
[00:18:31.106 --> 00:18:33.408]  Let's do shut our borders down.
[00:18:33.608 --> 00:18:35.009]  But you sound racist right now.
[00:18:35.629 --> 00:18:36.410]  I don't sound racist.
[00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.232]  I don't feel like I sound racist because I just want.
[00:18:39.252 --> 00:18:43.194]  If you were white, though, like they would be very racist.
[00:18:43.635 --> 00:18:43.995]  I agree.
[00:18:44.015 --> 00:18:44.535]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:18:45.076 --> 00:18:53.041]  I definitely agree, because it seems like the tables are kind of flipping around now that, you know, my culture as as African-Americans, we're able to say certain things.
[00:18:53.281 --> 00:18:58.745]  And then when Caucasians say the same thing, we kind of you know, we kind of take it out of proportion.
[00:19:02.702 --> 00:19:06.124]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:19:06.485 --> 00:19:13.609]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:22.575]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:19:22.815 --> 00:19:26.938]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:19:27.258 --> 00:19:32.602]  Pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:19:32.602 --> 00:19:32.862]  Let's do it!
[00:20:01.218 --> 00:20:15.429]  My fellow InfoWarriors, I am very excited to be able to announce to you the introduction at InfoWarsLife.com of a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsLife formulations like Survival Shield X2 and Super Metal Vitality.

[00:23:05.148 --> 00:23:12.831]  And so I think they're pulling out all the stops to try to dominate and crush a burgeoning liberty movement they can see the metrics of that will defeat them.
[00:23:13.051 --> 00:23:15.292]  In Hillary's own words, she's losing the info war.
[00:23:16.212 --> 00:23:17.652]  Or am I being too optimistic?
[00:23:17.672 --> 00:23:25.395]  I want to get his view on Donald Trump and so much more in this hour with the author of The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:23:25.415 --> 00:23:26.355]  Great to have you with us, sir.
[00:23:27.676 --> 00:23:28.336]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:23:28.876 --> 00:23:31.437]  I really enjoy your introduction.
[00:23:31.977 --> 00:23:33.738]  It looks like we have a lot of ground to cover today.
[00:23:34.738 --> 00:23:35.578]  Where would you like to start?
[00:23:35.598 --> 00:23:36.239]  There's so much.
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:38.900]  Well, you know me.
[00:23:39.421 --> 00:23:42.362]  I like to start with the big picture and then move into the details.
[00:23:43.703 --> 00:23:49.666]  Your question regarding where do we stand in the tableau of history, or the movement of history, I think is a good one.
[00:23:50.547 --> 00:23:54.629]  Because I know that it's true that history does repeat itself.
[00:23:54.649 --> 00:23:55.990]  There's no question about that.
[00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.352]  But every once in a while something new happens in history.
[00:23:59.452 --> 00:24:02.734]  Some little detail that's never really developed before.
[00:24:03.355 --> 00:24:05.976]  And I think we're living through that situation right now.
[00:24:07.477 --> 00:24:16.083]  We've come to a point in the evolution of communication and the concentration of command, as you put it so well.
[00:24:17.304 --> 00:24:21.847]  The globalization of society that the world has never experienced before.
[00:24:22.487 --> 00:24:24.929]  So, in the past we've always had lots of options.
[00:24:25.009 --> 00:24:25.069]  Yes.
[00:24:40.525 --> 00:24:47.252]  The characteristics of our day is that our options are being narrowed constantly, and we can see that every day.
[00:24:47.753 --> 00:24:49.094]  Fewer places to turn.
[00:24:49.114 --> 00:24:58.904]  This has never happened before, and I think the trend, therefore, that we're looking at, what's happening to us, what's happening to America, has to be viewed in that context.
[00:24:59.724 --> 00:25:02.385]  That the old rules may not apply.
[00:25:02.445 --> 00:25:06.065]  For example, you often hear, well, the economy always bounces back, doesn't it?
[00:25:06.105 --> 00:25:07.286]  I mean, we've been through this before.
[00:25:07.346 --> 00:25:08.446]  We've had ups and downs.
[00:25:08.466 --> 00:25:09.826]  We've had booms and busts.
[00:25:09.866 --> 00:25:11.167]  But we always come back.
[00:25:12.147 --> 00:25:12.787]  And that is true.
[00:25:12.927 --> 00:25:15.267]  That's the repeating of history that I was talking about.
[00:25:15.948 --> 00:25:17.388]  But yet, there's something new here.
[00:25:17.608 --> 00:25:21.049]  And the idea was that we had something to come back to.
[00:25:21.629 --> 00:25:22.409]  That there was a choice.
[00:25:22.469 --> 00:25:23.289]  There was another way.
[00:25:23.349 --> 00:25:25.390]  We could come back to the free market, for example.
[00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:26.690]  Get rid of all of the
[00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:27.611]  Thank you.
[00:25:43.088 --> 00:25:44.529]  That's a different scenario today.
[00:25:44.989 --> 00:25:50.732]  The whole trend of the international scene today is to get rid of that option, so there's no way to go back.
[00:25:51.792 --> 00:26:00.877]  You're just stuck with what you've got, and it gets worse and worse and worse, and the end of that line is not an option to go back, but to just buckle under and live under whatever the
[00:26:02.136 --> 00:26:04.578]  The powers that be decide is best for us.
[00:26:05.239 --> 00:26:09.222]  That's the most disturbing part of all this because I think our time is running out.
[00:26:09.482 --> 00:26:10.923]  Don't ask me how much time we have.
[00:26:10.943 --> 00:26:12.205]  The question always comes up.
[00:26:12.725 --> 00:26:13.726]  But I don't know.
[00:26:13.746 --> 00:26:20.632]  I have a feeling that it's coming up within a generation where maybe there will be no turning back.
[00:26:21.212 --> 00:26:30.947]  So that's the first observation I'd like to make, is that the decisions that are facing the American people today have a new characteristic to them.
[00:26:31.728 --> 00:26:36.375]  It's a little frightening, but at the same time it's hopeful in that once
[00:26:37.416 --> 00:26:48.122]  Let me not say once, but if we're able to accelerate and extend this awakening that you were mentioning just a moment ago in your introduction, that people are now aware of the Federal Reserve.
[00:26:48.142 --> 00:26:50.423]  They're aware that we have no options.
[00:26:50.583 --> 00:26:52.744]  They're aware that these things are being done to us.
[00:26:52.784 --> 00:26:56.726]  They're aware that our leaders are sort of thumbing their nose at us and saying, what are you going to do about it, you know?
[00:26:57.407 --> 00:26:59.048]  And so, where does that go?
[00:26:59.648 --> 00:27:02.569]  I think we see these two forces that are rising at the same time.
[00:27:02.589 --> 00:27:07.311]  Of course, the forces of totalitarianism are well in advance and we're coming along latecomers.
[00:27:07.671 --> 00:27:08.632]  But we're gaining on it.
[00:27:08.672 --> 00:27:09.352]  We're gaining on it.
[00:27:09.712 --> 00:27:13.634]  And I think as we come to the finish line, it's going to be a very close call.
[00:27:14.154 --> 00:27:15.135]  And so there's a certain...
[00:27:16.475 --> 00:27:21.140]  Uh, franticness I think that we see in the parts of these totalitarian forces.
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:29.550]  They want to finish the job real soon because otherwise the awakening that is now going on may overcome them and they also will lose the option.
[00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:30.210]  I agree.
[00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.491]  I agree.
[00:27:30.871 --> 00:27:32.152]  I want to expand on that.
[00:27:33.021 --> 00:27:34.061]  They're panicking.
[00:27:34.401 --> 00:27:40.843]  They went from denying all this to now just being arrogant and saying, you poor pathetic white people, your jobs will never come back.
[00:27:41.123 --> 00:27:44.644]  You don't have jobs, not because of globalism, because you were lazy and dumb.
[00:27:45.004 --> 00:27:53.627]  In national review, and just the weaponization of media, and the nakedness of, okay, we are run by shadow groups, big deal.
[00:27:54.147 --> 00:27:57.388]  And the Financial Times of London saying, and now for world government.
[00:27:57.448 --> 00:27:58.828]  Of course there's world government.
[00:27:59.088 --> 00:28:01.509]  And we're authoritarian, because we know best.
[00:28:02.719 --> 00:28:06.962]  I think their attempt to just break our back and bully us is backfiring.
[00:28:07.443 --> 00:28:10.945]  And I think they're really insulated, despite a lot of their smarts.
[00:28:11.646 --> 00:28:18.591]  They're not smart enough to realize that, A, they're killing the golden goose, bringing in totalitarianism that'll hang them as sure as it hangs us.
[00:28:19.292 --> 00:28:25.016]  But also, at the same time, they really do think, because there's all these yes-men around them, that they're insulated.
[00:28:25.376 --> 00:28:26.998]  And history shows that's just not the case.
[00:28:28.356 --> 00:28:31.379]  Well, I share that point of view.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:36.165]  It's an optimistic point of view in a time when it's hard to find optimism, but I do agree.
[00:28:36.185 --> 00:28:42.352]  I think that human nature is the one force that is the most powerful of all.
[00:28:43.313 --> 00:28:47.698]  It rises above economy, it rises above sociology, it rises above
[00:28:49.541 --> 00:28:59.121]  Human nature is such that we have this innate desire for justice and we may have trouble trying to figure out what is just because we're fed false information.
[00:28:59.761 --> 00:29:02.583]  You know, we're told that the good guys are really the bad guys.
[00:29:02.623 --> 00:29:06.486]  And so we're irate because we have the desire for justice.
[00:29:06.827 --> 00:29:15.213]  And so we sometimes attack the good guys simply because the info war that you talk about has convinced us that they are really the bad guys.
[00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:16.074]  So that's the problem.
[00:29:16.094 --> 00:29:18.015]  But still, human nature is such.
[00:29:18.796 --> 00:29:28.884]  And although our desire for justice and fairness and our innate wanting everybody to benefit, even though we may be a little selfish and we say, well, we want to benefit first.
[00:29:29.244 --> 00:29:30.185]  You know, that's natural.
[00:29:30.205 --> 00:29:31.586]  That's part of our human nature too.
[00:29:31.606 --> 00:29:35.409]  We have to take care of ourselves first before we can take care of others in need.
[00:29:35.429 --> 00:29:40.312]  We have to take care of our families first so that now we can take care of others that may need help.
[00:29:40.713 --> 00:29:41.513]  That is true.
[00:29:41.573 --> 00:29:43.955]  But still, we want the best for most people.
[00:29:44.275 --> 00:29:46.517]  So all of those things are not ever going to change.
[00:29:46.677 --> 00:29:51.140]  And even though a totalitarian system may be forced upon us globally,
[00:29:52.953 --> 00:29:56.334]  I think they're calling me from Washington now to say that I'm on the wrong track.
[00:29:57.495 --> 00:30:01.596]  But anyway, in spite of that, human nature I think eventually will rise above that.
[00:30:01.856 --> 00:30:04.497]  The only trouble with that scenario is that it may take a long time.
[00:30:05.037 --> 00:30:08.078]  And I really don't want to see it take a thousand years.
[00:30:08.518 --> 00:30:14.120]  I want to see this reversal happen, if not in my lifetime, certainly in the next generation.
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:20.382]  Let me ask you about Donald Trump and a bunch of other issues when we come back, and geopolitical issues as well, but just separately.
[00:30:21.937 --> 00:30:34.963]  Isn't the problem with even having a partial free market is that it creates so much wealth that we let our kids and grandkids get decadent, disconnected, and then allow them to be brainwashed at the foundation-controlled universities.
[00:30:35.023 --> 00:30:42.986]  I mean, I think that really, out of everything, that really simplifies it, is the people being raised by TV, raised by college, raised by state-run schools.
[00:30:43.567 --> 00:30:45.908]  They've got everything so good, but they have class envy.
[00:30:46.508 --> 00:30:57.734]  You know, seeing the Kardashians, and so they feel inadequate, and Bernie Sanders says, hey, I'm gonna give you everything free, and so they're just basically beguiled by that, because they've never had to actually fend for themselves.
[00:30:58.632 --> 00:30:59.452]  Well, it's certainly true.
[00:30:59.552 --> 00:31:01.973]  That's part of the human nature formula too.
[00:31:02.734 --> 00:31:05.174]  But I think we have to recognize that there are two forces here.
[00:31:05.315 --> 00:31:06.415]  One is the natural force.
[00:31:06.455 --> 00:31:09.256]  These things do take place over a period of time.
[00:31:09.616 --> 00:31:11.497]  Societies that prosper do decay.
[00:31:12.077 --> 00:31:14.478]  That's the repeating of history we're talking about.
[00:31:14.878 --> 00:31:20.420]  But the new element is that there are groups who are consciously accelerating that.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:20.800]  Yes.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.922]  They know that and they're playing upon it because it will benefit them right now.
[00:31:25.362 --> 00:31:26.883]  And by the way, it's declassified.
[00:31:26.903 --> 00:31:34.348]  The CIA, run by foreign groups by the 60s, was trying to subvert the family and break things down to make us all atomized and by ourselves.
[00:31:34.748 --> 00:31:35.529]  It's all public.
[00:31:36.109 --> 00:31:39.912]  The deviant TV, the art, it's not like I can't handle deviants like I'm Mr. Goody Two-Shoes.
[00:31:40.152 --> 00:31:45.576]  The point is they're targeting kids, folks, before they've grown and developed an understanding of it to screw them up.
[00:31:46.576 --> 00:31:48.357]  What we see unfolding is
[00:31:49.827 --> 00:32:03.742]  To me, a kind of refreshing development because the issues that previously have been well hidden from view are now right on the surface, as you have so dramatically pointed out, is right there in your face.
[00:32:04.242 --> 00:32:08.467]  And they like to put it in your face because they want to, they're boasting it.
[00:32:08.487 --> 00:32:09.768]  They're at that stage right now.
[00:32:10.649 --> 00:32:33.976]  And the issue I'm talking about is the fact that this whole phony baloney message that we have been getting over the past 50, 60 years about communism versus capitalism, socialism in there, fascism and Nazism and left and right and Republicans and Democrats, all of these splits, it's all phony because when you look at
[00:32:34.176 --> 00:32:40.461]  The leaders in all of these groups, they share the fundamental idea, the fundamental philosophy.
[00:32:40.982 --> 00:32:45.805]  Beneath all of this is the same, and you used the word in your introduction, it's collectivism.
[00:32:46.366 --> 00:32:51.270]  You accurately said that all these other things are merely different flavors, or different labels.
[00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:55.053]  You peel off the label and underneath it you find this thing called collectivism.
[00:33:02.165 --> 00:33:03.786]  The Knowledge of the Ancients.
[00:33:04.127 --> 00:33:07.670]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:10.552]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:33:10.873 --> 00:33:14.296]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:33:14.516 --> 00:33:18.219]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts.
[00:33:18.359 --> 00:33:19.180]  We're good to go!
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:47.821]  We're good.
[00:34:02.042 --> 00:34:08.204]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:34:08.224 --> 00:34:11.526]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:34:11.546 --> 00:34:13.286]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:34:13.326 --> 00:34:19.589]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:34:19.689 --> 00:34:25.611]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:34:25.751 --> 00:34:29.514]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:34:29.694 --> 00:34:32.637]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:34:32.777 --> 00:34:40.803]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:34:41.064 --> 00:34:43.105]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:34:43.145 --> 00:34:44.286]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:34:44.566 --> 00:34:46.248]  It's more vital than ever.
[00:34:46.408 --> 00:34:46.888]  I'm good to go.

[00:37:06.044 --> 00:37:07.305]  Excuse me, sir.
[00:37:07.365 --> 00:37:09.366]  Can we film you real quick?
[00:37:09.386 --> 00:37:12.287]  Can we film you real quick?
[00:37:12.387 --> 00:37:17.289]  Have you had a good day today as far as donations go?
[00:37:34.714 --> 00:37:38.877]  So, these people over here are talking about how love trumps hate, and they haven't shown you much love today, have they?
[00:37:41.539 --> 00:37:48.384]  So, as someone, well, I'm a Donald Trump supporter personally, and I'd like to give you $20.
[00:37:50.705 --> 00:37:57.890]  So, these people, they talk about love, but it seems like they're more here just to promote their message to me.
[00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:59.531]  They could be showing you love, but they haven't.
[00:37:59.772 --> 00:38:01.773]  That's just my opinion, but thank you.
[00:38:02.353 --> 00:38:02.914]  God bless you, sir.
[00:38:05.376 --> 00:38:06.836]  David Knight for Infowarriors.com.
[00:38:06.876 --> 00:38:09.397]  We're here in front of the Trump International Hotel.
[00:38:09.637 --> 00:38:10.458]  Soon to be, actually, in 2016.
[00:38:10.578 --> 00:38:12.418]  It's going to be opening as that.
[00:38:12.778 --> 00:38:15.719]  It has been the old historic post office site.
[00:38:15.859 --> 00:38:17.540]  Part of the National Historic Registry.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.260]  It was put up in 2013 for renovation bids.
[00:38:21.161 --> 00:38:21.741]  Trump got it.
[00:38:22.001 --> 00:38:23.402]  They worked on it for two years.
[00:38:23.482 --> 00:38:30.164]  The interesting thing is that they're on schedule, unlike all the road construction projects that we drove through on our way out here.
[00:38:30.184 --> 00:38:32.264]  And I'm sure you know about this in your area as well.
[00:38:32.284 --> 00:38:36.186]  We've got one in Austin that is going on for over five years now.
[00:38:36.246 --> 00:38:39.126]  Still no sign of completion as we're approaching this.
[00:38:39.167 --> 00:38:46.749]  And the reason we're here, as you can see behind me, there is a queue beginning for a press conference that is coming up about two o'clock eastern time.
[00:38:47.389 --> 00:38:48.950]  Donald Trump is going to be speaking here later.
[00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:53.313]  He'll be speaking to the APAC, American-Israel Public Affairs Committee.
[00:38:54.193 --> 00:38:56.755]  One of the interesting things is we're setting up here.
[00:38:57.615 --> 00:39:01.598]  There was a family came up here, parents and their, I guess, about 12-year-old son.
[00:39:02.218 --> 00:39:03.799]  The parents said, oh look, Trump.
[00:39:04.279 --> 00:39:05.020]  And the kid said,
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.741]  We're gonna die.
[00:39:07.121 --> 00:39:08.302]  We're all gonna die.
[00:39:08.482 --> 00:39:09.643]  Mom and Dad, we're gonna die.
[00:39:09.663 --> 00:39:10.924]  Now where do you think he heard that?
[00:39:11.264 --> 00:39:12.565]  Because he's telling his parents.
[00:39:13.046 --> 00:39:18.030]  He's echoing what he's been hearing at school, what they've been telling him on television.
[00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:22.273]  That's what Donald Trump is up against, that kind of false information.
[00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:32.181]  Of course, people are complaining this morning as I was looking at the news about the millions, billions actually, of dollars of free press that he's gotten, but it's all been pretty much negative.
[00:39:32.201 --> 00:39:34.843]  So then they complain that he's gotten all this negative press.
[00:39:35.223 --> 00:39:36.524]  As people are pushing back against him.
[00:39:36.804 --> 00:39:40.007]  Again, we're going to be at the AIPAC meeting tonight where he's going to be speaking.
[00:39:40.027 --> 00:39:41.668]  I'm sure there will be protests there.
[00:39:42.329 --> 00:39:45.771]  People will be protesting AIPAC as well as Donald Trump.
[00:39:45.811 --> 00:39:46.912]  So we're going to be covering that.
[00:39:47.212 --> 00:39:49.994]  We'll be live on the Alex Jones Show in just a couple of hours.
[00:39:50.014 --> 00:39:55.138]  2 o'clock they're going to have the conference here and we're going to be on a little bit before that.
[00:39:56.199 --> 00:39:57.940]  Donald Trump has got to go!
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:03.203]  If anyone here is opposed to Donald Trump, please come up here and join us.
[00:40:03.623 --> 00:40:14.048]  If you're one of the people who wants to build bridges with our neighbors in Mexico, in Canada, anywhere in the world, instead of wall, please come up here and join us.
[00:40:14.348 --> 00:40:15.709]  You're a piece of coal.
[00:40:15.729 --> 00:40:16.529]  Thank you.
[00:40:16.589 --> 00:40:21.432]  We are opposed to the victory here by Donald Trump all over this nation.
[00:40:22.486 --> 00:40:32.571]  There are literally three times, four times as many people here watching them as there are protesters here.
[00:40:51.366 --> 00:40:55.588]  Trump, Trump, you can't hide, we can see your racist side.
[00:40:55.688 --> 00:40:59.869]  Trump, Trump, you can't hide, we can see your racist side.
[00:41:00.029 --> 00:41:04.210]  Donald Trump, you can't hide, we can see your racist side.
[00:41:04.371 --> 00:41:08.492]  Donald Trump, you can't hide, we can see your racist side.
[00:41:11.889 --> 00:41:22.690]  So, it looks like the city of Washington DC has given this beautiful, beautiful building to Donald.
[00:41:27.215 --> 00:41:32.240]  So he might be good at building hotels, but he's not good at building our nation!
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:35.663]  He's not good at making friends!
[00:41:35.724 --> 00:41:39.347]  We want bridges, not walls!
[00:41:39.427 --> 00:41:42.290]  We want bridges, not walls!
[00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:43.351]  We want bridges!
[00:41:44.472 --> 00:41:45.693]  We want bridges!
[00:41:45.773 --> 00:41:49.477]  We love our people!
[00:41:49.537 --> 00:41:54.681]  We want to live in a peaceful world!
[00:42:03.289 --> 00:42:06.370]  Donald Trump wants to build big walls.
[00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:10.371]  Donald Trump wants to build big walls.
[00:42:10.852 --> 00:42:14.453]  Donald Trump wants to build big walls.
[00:42:14.673 --> 00:42:17.454]  Donald Trump wants to build big walls.
[00:42:17.574 --> 00:42:22.436]  Donald Trump has got to go!
[00:42:22.896 --> 00:42:26.497]  Donald Trump has got to go!
[00:42:26.997 --> 00:42:29.818]  Donald Trump has got to go!
[00:42:29.898 --> 00:42:32.659]  Donald Trump has got to go!
[00:42:48.122 --> 00:42:50.644]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:05.664 --> 00:43:05.844]  Yeah.
[00:43:19.366 --> 00:43:21.688]  We've had a couple of interesting developments the last couple of days.
[00:43:22.268 --> 00:43:24.550]  First of all, there was one of the rallies in Arizona yesterday.
[00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:41.442]  Two people showed up with all the symbolism of the Ku Klux Klan, a man and a woman, and as they were leading them out with their protests, their Ku Klux Klan robes and everything, a black Trump supporter punches and kicks the guy who's dressed up in all this Klan regalia.
[00:43:42.242 --> 00:43:45.584]  Now that's an interesting, teachable moment there, because
[00:43:46.485 --> 00:43:49.189]  Why do you think the black guy was so upset?
[00:43:49.649 --> 00:43:55.037]  I think it's because he realizes, number one, Donald Trump is not promoting this racism.
[00:43:55.197 --> 00:43:56.919]  These people are promoting the racism.
[00:43:57.239 --> 00:44:01.886]  And they're also making light of something that is very serious.
[00:44:01.906 --> 00:44:02.306]  See, when you
[00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:06.531]  Do the boy who cries wolf about racism.
[00:44:07.151 --> 00:44:09.232]  You give real racism a pass.
[00:44:09.292 --> 00:44:13.114]  And I think that's what the black guy who attacked him was really angry about.
[00:44:13.814 --> 00:44:19.517]  Not only that, but there was a couple of articles in terms of the Hitler meme that they're throwing at Donald Trump all the time.
[00:44:19.657 --> 00:44:24.899]  You had David Duke say, hey, comparing Hitler to Donald Trump or vice versa is really good for Hitler.
[00:44:25.299 --> 00:44:27.260]  And at the same time, the Jews said that.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.301]  Stop with it already.
[00:44:28.941 --> 00:44:30.762]  You're using this in a way that
[00:44:31.442 --> 00:44:34.443]  It denigrates the real evil here, the real racism.
[00:44:35.063 --> 00:44:37.164]  And of course Donald Trump is going to be speaking to AIPAC.
[00:44:37.784 --> 00:44:57.270]  We've had announcements that at least 40 rabbis and religious leaders at the American-Israeli political convention that's going to be going on, I don't know the whole acronym, but essentially AIPAC is, if you don't know, the lobbyist group that pushes to have Israel's interests put above America's interests.
[00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:02.897]  And of course they want to say that Donald Trump is promoting hatred and racism and division in our country.
[00:45:03.759 --> 00:45:06.523]  And so they're going to walk out in protests.
[00:45:06.743 --> 00:45:08.426]  And I would say to those people.
[00:45:10.252 --> 00:45:11.554]  Look at the hypocrisy.
[00:45:12.014 --> 00:45:16.718]  The state of Israel patrols its borders more rigidly and more carefully.
[00:45:16.799 --> 00:45:23.405]  They divide people into different groups more than any other nation on earth.
[00:45:23.565 --> 00:45:27.248]  And they want to talk about racial division, about religious division.
[00:45:27.549 --> 00:45:29.591]  Take the moral, hypocritical ground.
[00:45:29.631 --> 00:45:30.912]  And of course, it's not just the Jews.
[00:45:31.292 --> 00:45:33.915]  We've seen this with the Vatican and their walled city.
[00:45:34.495 --> 00:45:44.770]  We've seen it even with the Christians who want to say that Donald Trump is creating an atmosphere of hatred because he used the word bimbo when Megyn Kelly attacked him.
[00:45:49.238 --> 00:45:52.600]  This is an across-the-board attack.
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:46:01.564]  All these different religions, and as I pointed out earlier today, NPR ran a piece about National Review, a particular writer there, Kevin Williamson.
[00:46:01.604 --> 00:46:08.008]  Of course, he was supported by somebody who wrote another op-ed piece a couple of days after he wrote his piece.
[00:46:08.088 --> 00:46:16.472]  So many people were just amazed, even people on the left, at the hatred for the white middle class exuding from this National Review article.
[00:46:16.952 --> 00:46:22.376]  Putting the words globalist and establishment in quotes and saying it's not the quote-unquote establishment's fault.
[00:46:22.716 --> 00:46:24.558]  It's your fault, white middle class.
[00:46:24.738 --> 00:46:25.859]  You're a bunch of losers.
[00:46:26.199 --> 00:46:27.820]  You can't blame anybody but yourself.
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.783]  And of course they've been saying that to black people for decades.
[00:46:31.741 --> 00:46:33.102]  And now they're saying it to the white people.
[00:46:33.162 --> 00:46:47.550]  Where were the establishment people, where were the National Review people when they were stealing everyone's homes, white, black, everyone's homes, less than 10 years ago, sending us the bill to bail out their banks, to bail out their speculation force?
[00:46:48.131 --> 00:46:49.271]  No, we can't.
[00:46:49.371 --> 00:46:51.412]  It's not the establishment's fault.
[00:46:51.512 --> 00:46:52.113]  It's our fault.
[00:46:52.193 --> 00:47:00.578]  Look, we need to come together across these phony religious and especially the racial lines, but also the class warfare.
[00:47:03.004 --> 00:47:04.006]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.547 --> 00:47:06.831]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.112 --> 00:47:14.966]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:05.322 --> 00:49:06.743]  David Knight, InfoWars.com.
[00:49:06.783 --> 00:49:09.124]  I'm standing here at the AIPAC convention.
[00:49:09.624 --> 00:49:12.845]  Of course, Donald Trump and some of the other presidential candidates are speaking here tonight.
[00:49:13.326 --> 00:49:16.567]  It was reported by Gateway Pundit
[00:49:17.116 --> 00:49:23.400]  And it was carried on drudge as a Red Link story that there were hundreds, perhaps thousands of anti-Trump protesters.
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:26.962]  And I'm cutting this report to tell you we have been here the entire time.
[00:49:27.262 --> 00:49:29.444]  That report is absolutely false.
[00:49:29.984 --> 00:49:31.425]  There are not hundreds of protesters.
[00:49:31.765 --> 00:49:36.608]  This core of protesters over here that you see here right now, those were the people that were here the entire time.
[00:49:36.848 --> 00:49:45.694]  Now when you show pictures of the protests, what you saw were literally several thousand people, about 15,000 people were going to AIPAC convention.
[00:49:46.014 --> 00:49:48.135]  And they were lined up and processed and going through.
[00:49:48.195 --> 00:49:51.896]  They were dressed in suits and ties and yarmulkes, okay?
[00:49:52.476 --> 00:49:57.718]  This is the small group over here in this corner that everybody was having to file past.
[00:49:58.198 --> 00:49:59.858]  That's the number of protesters.
[00:49:59.939 --> 00:50:02.559]  And, of course, people standing there like us taking pictures of them.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:06.901]  But they always overstate their presence, okay?
[00:50:07.001 --> 00:50:09.121]  There were not a thousand protesters here.
[00:50:09.201 --> 00:50:10.682]  There were not hundreds of protesters.
[00:50:10.962 --> 00:50:13.183]  Perhaps a hundred protesters at the peak.
[00:50:13.464 --> 00:50:16.045]  And this is about what the peak looked like, right here.
[00:50:16.525 --> 00:50:22.649]  As we walk around that crowd, in the crowd, around the crowd, in both directions, and I'm telling you, that's the core protesters.
[00:50:22.689 --> 00:50:23.349]  They're still there.
[00:50:23.729 --> 00:50:26.891]  That's the number of protesters that showed up at this event.
[00:50:27.372 --> 00:50:29.113]  And it is not a Trump rally.
[00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:33.455]  This is an AIPAC event where Trump is speaking along with other presidential candidates.
[00:50:33.975 --> 00:50:37.277]  Now you can see the Hitler symbolism.
[00:50:37.317 --> 00:50:38.758]  Here's one picture right here.
[00:50:38.918 --> 00:50:39.519]  Somebody's done
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:43.481]  Nazi is a sign of Hitler.
[00:50:43.841 --> 00:50:46.103]  And then there's this Trump equals a Nazi sign.
[00:50:46.123 --> 00:50:47.464]  Let's go over here and see who this is.
[00:50:48.963 --> 00:50:52.905]  Do you think this is very helpful at an AIPAC convention to put this sign up?
[00:50:54.165 --> 00:50:59.567]  We're at a historical tipping point, buddy.
[00:50:59.667 --> 00:51:01.368]  So you think Trump is a Nazi?
[00:51:01.388 --> 00:51:02.528]  You think this gets your message?
[00:51:02.628 --> 00:51:03.008]  You do?
[00:51:03.168 --> 00:51:03.549]  You do?
[00:51:03.689 --> 00:51:04.029]  Okay.
[00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.529]  He's a Nazi.
[00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:06.490]  He has violence in his rallies.
[00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:08.350]  You compare him to the Hitler of 1929.
[00:51:09.071 --> 00:51:11.152]  You compare him to the Mussolini of 1920.
[00:51:12.532 --> 00:51:14.013]  You don't think that's an overstatement?
[00:51:14.514 --> 00:51:14.674]  No.
[00:51:14.694 --> 00:51:15.835]  I'm a historian.
[00:51:16.295 --> 00:51:17.516]  I know what I'm talking about.
[00:51:17.837 --> 00:51:18.918]  There are multiple points.
[00:51:19.318 --> 00:51:20.459]  And you're Webster Tarpley, right?
[00:51:20.479 --> 00:51:21.059]  I'm Webster Tarpley.
[00:51:21.099 --> 00:51:21.500]  That's it.
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:23.341]  We've got Webster Tarpley here.
[00:51:23.642 --> 00:51:26.004]  And Webster Tarpley thinks that Donald Trump is a Nazi.
[00:51:26.084 --> 00:51:27.104]  Absolutely a Nazi.
[00:51:27.865 --> 00:51:39.053]  And I'm appalled to see libertarians, who were supposed to be the opposite of authoritarian, totalitarian, all trooping like lemmings into this Trump convent.
[00:51:39.233 --> 00:51:47.638]  Years ago, people who called themselves libertarians never would have supported Donald Trump.
[00:51:48.159 --> 00:51:50.240]  Do you understand what's going on with globalism?
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.341]  Do you see the open borders and the multinational companies?
[00:51:52.361 --> 00:51:53.722]  I used to work with the libertarians.
[00:51:54.043 --> 00:51:57.485]  And the libertarians I used to work with never, ever!
[00:51:57.845 --> 00:51:59.226]  Would have endorsed Donald Trump.
[00:52:00.046 --> 00:52:01.967]  I'm not working with the Libertarians anymore.
[00:52:02.507 --> 00:52:04.107]  So who do you work with?
[00:52:04.387 --> 00:52:04.948]  Webster.
[00:52:05.508 --> 00:52:05.788]  Yes.
[00:52:05.988 --> 00:52:07.469]  Now why is he a Nazi?
[00:52:08.529 --> 00:52:09.589]  Why is he a Nazi?
[00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:11.910]  12 million deportations.
[00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:13.291]  That's a police state right away.
[00:52:13.891 --> 00:52:16.072]  That's the knock on the door in the middle of the night.
[00:52:16.432 --> 00:52:18.573]  Women and children dragged out of the door.
[00:52:18.793 --> 00:52:22.074]  What if somebody comes into your home and doesn't leave?
[00:52:22.094 --> 00:52:23.394]  Do you call the police?
[00:52:23.414 --> 00:52:24.315]  Do you call the police with that?
[00:52:25.135 --> 00:52:27.698]  That's not my Libertarian word game.
[00:52:28.119 --> 00:52:30.061]  I'm quoting a Cuban mayor from Florida.
[00:52:30.101 --> 00:52:31.022]  He says to his wife... If the U.S.
[00:52:31.042 --> 00:52:34.987]  is supposed to be against a police state, get ready to see the biggest police state that you've ever seen.
[00:52:35.287 --> 00:52:40.453]  12 million deportations means holding cells made out of stadiums, cattle cars out of this country.
[00:52:40.954 --> 00:52:44.398]  I don't know what you guys are... Well, they could always go home, couldn't they?
[00:52:45.543 --> 00:52:48.084]  Look, let's live in the real world, huh?
[00:52:48.404 --> 00:52:49.065]  Stop with the word games.
[00:52:49.085 --> 00:52:49.925]  I do live in the real world.
[00:52:50.005 --> 00:52:51.666]  I have zero tolerance for your word games.
[00:52:52.166 --> 00:52:53.006]  Twelve million deportations.
[00:52:53.026 --> 00:52:53.627]  Well, I've got a word game.
[00:52:53.707 --> 00:52:56.208]  If people come here illegally... Forget illegal.
[00:52:56.248 --> 00:52:57.508]  The whole country is illegal.
[00:52:57.708 --> 00:52:59.849]  The government is based on assassinations.
[00:52:59.869 --> 00:53:01.150]  You know this better than anybody.
[00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:03.531]  Why start with the most defenseless people?
[00:53:03.991 --> 00:53:06.252]  Because they're being scapegoated, a la Hitler.
[00:53:06.632 --> 00:53:08.433]  Hitler says, there's a depression.
[00:53:08.813 --> 00:53:10.474]  Who's responsible for the depression?
[00:53:10.934 --> 00:53:12.975]  Is it the Wall Street bankers?
[00:53:13.295 --> 00:53:14.616]  No, says Donald Trump.
[00:53:14.696 --> 00:53:15.676]  It's those wetbacks.
[00:53:15.896 --> 00:53:19.738]  Well, I think he has blamed it on the Wall Street bankers and NAFTA and TPP.
[00:53:19.838 --> 00:53:21.859]  He is not lifting a finger against them.
[00:53:22.339 --> 00:53:33.505]  Well, he hasn't done anything because he's not president yet, but he's talked about... What he's done is lie and lie and flip-flop and flip-flop just about anything he says, you can't believe.
[00:53:33.545 --> 00:53:34.385]  Here's what we do know.
[00:53:34.826 --> 00:53:35.886]  He wants riots.
[00:53:36.507 --> 00:53:41.469]  If he doesn't get the nomination given to him on a silver platter, he wants to have riots.
[00:53:41.829 --> 00:53:43.630]  Now, you know... I think that's a mischaracterization.
[00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:45.071]  You're talking about playing word games.
[00:53:45.091 --> 00:53:46.192]  That's a mischaracterization.
[00:53:46.952 --> 00:53:52.936]  If you don't get the absolute majority on the first ballot, you go to the second ballot, and the third, and the fourth.
[00:53:53.016 --> 00:53:54.777]  And what he's saying is, no, no, no, no.
[00:53:55.217 --> 00:54:00.880]  The whole course of American history is not good enough for His Highness Donald Trump.
[00:54:01.241 --> 00:54:07.885]  He says, I want the nomination after the first ballot, even if I don't get the absolute majority.
[00:54:07.905 --> 00:54:11.166]  So a minority candidate is going to get the nomination.
[00:54:11.447 --> 00:54:12.087]  Ridiculous.
[00:54:12.167 --> 00:54:14.829]  Let me ask you, have you ever seen a situation where you got the
[00:54:15.569 --> 00:54:20.492]  The RNC head, chair, and the delegate saying, we're going to hand it to somebody who didn't even run?
[00:54:21.412 --> 00:54:21.792]  I don't know.
[00:54:21.812 --> 00:54:23.353]  I'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
[00:54:23.573 --> 00:54:24.393]  Anyway, don't get me wrong.
[00:54:24.413 --> 00:54:25.554]  Well, I think that's what he was talking about.
[00:54:25.574 --> 00:54:26.334]  I'm not a Republican.
[00:54:26.495 --> 00:54:31.557]  I have never stooped so low in so much degradation to be a Republican.
[00:54:31.597 --> 00:54:32.237]  I'm not going to do it.
[00:54:32.257 --> 00:54:33.178]  Let's get back to it, though.
[00:54:33.558 --> 00:54:38.941]  He says riots, and then he says over the weekend in Arizona, Second Amendment.
[00:54:38.981 --> 00:54:40.762]  He's going to win big with the Second Amendment.
[00:54:40.782 --> 00:54:43.063]  So we take riots and Second Amendment.
[00:54:43.103 --> 00:54:44.504]  I think it's got to do with guns.
[00:54:44.564 --> 00:54:44.984]  Am I right?
[00:54:46.525 --> 00:54:51.350]  I think that's a bit of a stretch.
[00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:57.976]  I think what he's saying is that people would riot if the RNC puts in somebody that hasn't even participated in the process.
[00:54:57.996 --> 00:55:00.098]  Somebody like Romney or somebody like Paul Ryan.
[00:55:00.418 --> 00:55:01.699]  Is InfoWars against the First Amendment?
[00:55:01.719 --> 00:55:03.740]  Is InfoWars always against the First Amendment?
[00:55:23.473 --> 00:55:23.954]  Absolutely.
[00:55:24.014 --> 00:55:24.374]  Look, look.
[00:55:24.554 --> 00:55:25.495]  Wait a minute.
[00:55:25.535 --> 00:55:28.879]  Donald Trump not said that he wants to increase the surveillance state.
[00:55:29.119 --> 00:55:30.020]  Has he not said that?
[00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:30.721]  Yes, he has.
[00:55:30.781 --> 00:55:32.102]  And we have also said we oppose him on it.
[00:55:32.182 --> 00:55:33.444]  And how can you guys sell out to that?
[00:55:33.484 --> 00:55:34.044]  How can you not?
[00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:35.085]  You're shilling for him.
[00:55:35.105 --> 00:55:36.387]  You're shilling for him.
[00:55:36.427 --> 00:55:37.588]  You're shilling for him.
[00:55:37.908 --> 00:55:38.128]  Come on.
[00:55:38.669 --> 00:55:40.750]  You're being conned!
[00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:41.771]  You're being conned!
[00:55:41.851 --> 00:55:45.674]  Do you understand what's going on with TPP, with TTIP?
[00:55:45.694 --> 00:55:48.255]  Do you understand that's the critical path for globalism?
[00:55:48.415 --> 00:55:49.356]  Do you understand that?
[00:55:49.376 --> 00:55:52.258]  We want 15% protective tariff.
[00:55:52.818 --> 00:55:56.161]  The Tax Wall Street Party demands a 15% protective tariff.
[00:55:56.181 --> 00:55:57.661]  Well, he wants a higher protective tariff.
[00:55:57.682 --> 00:55:59.383]  No, he wants to use that as a weapon.
[00:55:59.423 --> 00:56:00.924]  He wants to use that as a threat, but not really have it.
[00:56:00.944 --> 00:56:05.947]  He wants to use that as a weapon in business negotiations, so he can say there's Nabisco and crap.
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:08.241]  Yeah, but I think you're arguing semantics.
[00:56:08.301 --> 00:56:14.784]  I don't think you're giving him credit for... The thing that the Republicans are criticizing him for is protectionism, and he's with you on that issue.
[00:56:14.804 --> 00:56:16.765]  He's using it as a weapon to create his own monopolies.
[00:56:17.125 --> 00:56:18.045]  You're being conned.
[00:56:18.526 --> 00:56:19.806]  So your party is what?
[00:56:20.427 --> 00:56:21.647]  Tax and Wealth State Party.
[00:56:21.727 --> 00:56:23.268]  A couple of other points.
[00:56:23.508 --> 00:56:25.149]  Trump says wages are too high.
[00:56:25.269 --> 00:56:26.249]  Wages are too high?
[00:56:26.629 --> 00:56:28.530]  That the minimum wage is a bad thing?
[00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:29.191]  Are we nuts?
[00:56:30.111 --> 00:56:36.513]  Then he also says he's willing to tolerate unions, but he doesn't want them to expand.
[00:56:36.653 --> 00:56:37.554]  Don't be a dupe for Trump!
[00:56:37.574 --> 00:56:38.734]  Don't be a dupe for Trump!
[00:56:38.854 --> 00:56:46.777]  He's willing to tolerate them where they exist, but otherwise he's going to use the Taft-Hartley Slave Labor Act and prevent people from creating unions.
[00:56:46.817 --> 00:56:52.299]  So, his tax reform, the top rate goes down from 40 to 25 percent.
[00:56:52.739 --> 00:56:55.380]  It's a bonanza for the top one-tenth of one percent.
[00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:58.161]  Did you agree with or oppose the Reagan tax cuts?
[00:56:58.461 --> 00:56:58.641]  Huh?
[00:56:59.281 --> 00:57:00.261]  Do you agree with her?
[00:57:00.301 --> 00:57:00.862]  The Reagan tax?
[00:57:00.882 --> 00:57:02.022]  Because he lowered taxes.
[00:57:02.042 --> 00:57:02.962]  They were a disaster!
[00:57:02.982 --> 00:57:05.923]  They were a disaster because... Then we have a disagreement on that.
[00:57:05.963 --> 00:57:07.064]  Here's what he did.
[00:57:07.304 --> 00:57:16.107]  He ballooned the deficit and then he turned around and raised the Social Security payroll tax to take that out of the hide of wage earners.
[00:57:16.447 --> 00:57:22.589]  So what he did was a massive redistribution of wealth from the middle and the lower to the upper.
[00:57:22.649 --> 00:57:24.290]  That's Reagan in a nutshell.
[00:57:24.350 --> 00:57:24.670]  Complete fraud.
[00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:29.775]  Yeah, I agree that lowering taxes and increasing spending was a formula for disaster.
[00:57:30.095 --> 00:57:32.758]  I think that I'm on the side of lowering taxes, though.
[00:57:33.098 --> 00:57:34.159]  And you disagree.
[00:57:34.239 --> 00:57:37.562]  Yeah, but you disagree with lowering the taxes.
[00:57:37.603 --> 00:57:39.925]  When did you guys become such acolytes for Reagan?
[00:57:41.186 --> 00:57:43.228]  Yeah, you guys are just normal Republicans.
[00:57:43.248 --> 00:57:44.729]  You're right-wing Republicans.
[00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:47.032]  People who are selling out!
[00:57:47.052 --> 00:57:47.552]  Okay, alright.
[00:57:47.612 --> 00:57:48.213]  Thank you very much.
[00:57:49.199 --> 00:57:50.720]  We're sellouts.
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:53.101]  Alright, here we go.
[00:57:53.441 --> 00:57:55.442]  This is Donald Trump as a fascist.
[00:57:55.462 --> 00:57:56.723]  You just heard Webster Tarfley.
[00:57:57.243 --> 00:58:00.625]  And of course, anybody that's listened to me knows that I'm not a Reagan fan.
[00:58:00.685 --> 00:58:02.606]  I think that there's many things that Reagan did wrong.
[00:58:03.086 --> 00:58:07.768]  Lowering the income tax was about the only thing he did right, but of course Webster doesn't like that.
[00:58:08.188 --> 00:58:14.071]  Webster says that we can't trust Donald Trump because he wants to raise tariffs perhaps as much as 45% when he would go 15%.
[00:58:16.172 --> 00:58:16.933]  So, there you go.
[00:58:17.134 --> 00:58:19.077]  If he triples, he can't do anything right.
[00:58:19.417 --> 00:58:21.140]  And look, I'm not going to apologize.
[00:58:22.213 --> 00:58:24.314]  For what Donald Trump has said about civil liberties.
[00:58:24.435 --> 00:58:28.137]  I think he's absolutely wrong on those issues and we can have a fight about that.
[00:58:28.197 --> 00:58:42.287]  I would rather have a fight with him on civil liberties than to have a fight with somebody like Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders or especially Ted Cruz who says he's for civil liberties and then comes in the back door and picks your pocket on it because he's lying to you.
[00:58:42.607 --> 00:58:47.971]  At least have a person who's going to come at you and say, I'm going to do this, that'll get people fired up I think.
[00:58:49.172 --> 00:58:50.516]  Well that's it for our show tonight.
[00:58:50.536 --> 00:58:54.949]  I'm Jakari Jackson from the Info Wars Command Center, and we'll see you again tomorrow night.
