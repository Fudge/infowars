[00:00:19.648 --> 00:00:21.692]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.772 --> 00:00:23.054]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.414 --> 00:00:27.060]  It is February 3rd, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:30.816 --> 00:00:38.744]  Tonight, after a week showing in the Iowa caucus two days ago, Rand Paul drops out of the race along with former Iowa winner Rick Santorum.
[00:00:38.964 --> 00:00:42.607]  So far, three Republicans and one Democrat have dropped out after Iowa.
[00:00:42.907 --> 00:00:49.073]  Then, Finnish police seem to be suggesting that stern glances can warn off sexual assaults.
[00:00:49.554 --> 00:00:53.257]  Or are they suggesting women use the force?
[00:00:54.722 --> 00:00:56.983]  It's been coded to your palm print so only you can fire it.
[00:00:57.703 --> 00:01:02.124]  Bloomberg sponsors a poll that claims most gun owners would buy smart guns.
[00:01:03.164 --> 00:01:04.345]  Buy a smart gun.
[00:01:04.745 --> 00:01:08.846]  The reality is smart guns may be even less effective than the force.
[00:01:13.287 --> 00:01:15.948]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:01.624]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:03.206]  You can't survive without it.
[00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:04.308]  But where do you get it?
[00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:10.375]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:16.302]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:33.360]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.882]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:36.242 --> 00:02:37.443]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:38.504]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:38.744 --> 00:02:39.365]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:39.665 --> 00:02:41.487]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:03:04.028 --> 00:03:07.691]  If you watch the show, you know I'm a very strong advocate of self-defense.
[00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:10.973]  And to that, I want you to have the means to probably defend yourself.
[00:03:11.013 --> 00:03:17.998]  That's not knocking the police or anybody else, but when it comes down to it, you don't have two or three minutes for somebody else to get there to save you, assuming they can save you.
[00:03:18.018 --> 00:03:20.260]  You need to have the means to defend yourself.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.282]  But in Finland, they have a very different approach.
[00:03:23.362 --> 00:03:27.645]  In a very bizarre video that was posted today by Paul Joseph Watson, this is a real video.
[00:03:27.745 --> 00:03:29.886]  I want to make it very clear, this is not satire.
[00:03:29.906 --> 00:03:32.909]  They're telling the young ladies out there, if you're attacked, you say no.
[00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:34.849]  No, like a dog.
[00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:39.271]  And you see the guy, he cowers away in fear because this woman said no.
[00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:46.173]  And eventually in the video, she does strike the guy with her purse, which I would probably recommend something like that to start with, but no, no.
[00:03:46.713 --> 00:03:48.994]  You shove him back, then he will just leave you alone.
[00:03:49.294 --> 00:03:52.355]  You put your hand out like you, ooh, whoa, she just used the force right there.
[00:03:52.675 --> 00:03:54.355]  And once again, this is not a satire piece.
[00:03:54.715 --> 00:03:55.676]  This is a real video.
[00:03:55.696 --> 00:03:59.677]  They're showing women how you use the force to pretty much stop your attacker.
[00:04:00.257 --> 00:04:05.082]  And this is in lieu of having the ladies carry things like tasers, guns, pepper spray, pocket knives.
[00:04:05.422 --> 00:04:08.024]  They're saying, hey, you do like this and the guy's going to leave you alone.
[00:04:08.344 --> 00:04:10.266]  No, that doesn't happen in the real world.
[00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:15.611]  And eventually, yeah, she does start to strike him with a purse, which I would recommend doing that before trying to use the force.
[00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:18.674]  And that's just one of the ridiculous things that are going on around the world.
[00:04:18.754 --> 00:04:23.838]  It's pretty much victim disarmament, making the world a victim disarmament zone all the way around.
[00:04:23.858 --> 00:04:26.181]  And it brings me to our next article, Survey.
[00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:29.242]  Claims that most gun owners would buy smart guns.
[00:04:29.282 --> 00:04:35.386]  Now once again, if you choose to buy a smart gun, that's your business, but I just don't want to get to a point where it's federally mandated.
[00:04:35.766 --> 00:04:44.651]  And the article says, in a web-based survey of 4,000 individuals performed in January of 2015, 59% said they'd be willing to consider a child-proof gun.
[00:04:45.171 --> 00:04:54.000]  But this thing was put on, the survey was put on by a strong gun control advocate who is a professor at John Hopkins Bloomberg School, Department of Health Policy and Management.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.402]  That is quite the title he has there.
[00:04:56.762 --> 00:05:01.507]  And he's also a director of the School Center for Gun Policy and Research.
[00:05:02.027 --> 00:05:05.250]  Which makes me kind of skeptical of this survey because they always say, most gun owners want this.
[00:05:05.311 --> 00:05:05.511]  I'm like,
[00:05:06.111 --> 00:05:07.232]  9 out of 10 gun owners want that.
[00:05:07.252 --> 00:05:08.974]  I'm like, you guys didn't ask me at all.
[00:05:08.994 --> 00:05:12.897]  And I'm pretty sure they didn't ask any of the guys in the crew, you know, who are proud gun owners.
[00:05:12.957 --> 00:05:14.279]  So I'm always skeptical of this.
[00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:19.663]  Just like the other day, I went out to the University of Texas and I asked people who their favorite presidential candidates were.
[00:05:20.124 --> 00:05:22.666]  Many of them saying, or most of them saying, Bernie Sanders.
[00:05:23.026 --> 00:05:29.893]  It didn't surprise me because Bernie Sanders has many young voters, many first-time voters say they would vote for Bernie if given the chance to.
[00:05:30.393 --> 00:05:33.475]  But I understand you go to a college, you're going to get a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters.
[00:05:33.515 --> 00:05:35.797]  So you take that with a grain of salt.
[00:05:35.817 --> 00:05:40.460]  I'm pretty sure if I would have went to a steakhouse, I would have got some, you know, Republican supporters.
[00:05:40.981 --> 00:05:45.264]  Now talking about Republicans, Rand Paul has left the race as well as Rick Santorum.
[00:05:45.704 --> 00:05:48.066]  I know many of you guys didn't even know Rick Santorum was running.
[00:05:48.526 --> 00:05:53.290]  But in his farewell address, Dr. Paul said, Thanks again to the people of Iowa.
[00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.213]  It was great getting to meet you, and I am especially grateful for the enthusiasm of students.
[00:05:58.353 --> 00:05:58.773]  Fight on.
[00:05:59.694 --> 00:06:02.596]  So, as you guys know, Rand Paul is my favorite candidate.
[00:06:02.616 --> 00:06:06.759]  If I can't vote for Rand Paul, I'm probably just going to vote in somebody or write in somebody like David Knight.
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.303]  I'm not going to vote for Hillary Clinton or Bernie or Trump.
[00:06:11.963 --> 00:06:17.988]  I think other people in the party can make, you know, decent cabinet members, but I don't think any of them are the guy for the top spot.
[00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.212]  Now, let's talk about some diversity on campuses.
[00:06:21.312 --> 00:06:25.274]  Now they have, at the University of Connecticut, a black-only dorm.
[00:06:25.695 --> 00:06:34.260]  Now, when I talk about this story, I understand that there's a time when you had black-only universities, or historically black universities, because they couldn't go to other schools.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.960]  I understand that.
[00:06:35.221 --> 00:06:37.862]  But when you have a dorm like this, I just feel like you're segregating yourself.
[00:06:38.262 --> 00:06:46.788]  But they're saying the dorm, which opens this fall, is supposedly intended to help the school pool resources of African-American students in a program called Scholars House.
[00:06:47.188 --> 00:06:53.613]  And they say some people are criticizing it, including the president for the Center of Equal Opportunity, Roger Clegg.
[00:06:53.994 --> 00:06:58.597]  He's saying, let's stop this nonsense and stop looking at people on the basis of their color.
[00:06:59.518 --> 00:07:05.183]  And in some other college news, we have this, a chart that shows how you're not exactly getting the best deal when you go to college.
[00:07:05.683 --> 00:07:10.626]  And it says, the president is saying that you need to have a college degree because it's more valuable than ever.
[00:07:11.066 --> 00:07:17.030]  But they're saying the immediate returns are the lowest they've been in this generation, a new data poll shows.
[00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.893]  So it just goes to show you, a college education isn't all that's cracked up to be.
[00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:23.034]  Once again, I'm not telling you not to get an education.
[00:07:23.394 --> 00:07:29.818]  I'm saying you got to spend all this money and time and all this stuff taking art appreciation and all these other classes that you don't necessarily need.
[00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:31.760]  You're just feeding into the issue.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.022]  And finally, before we go on to our other segments,
[00:07:35.402 --> 00:07:38.204]  Mrs. Clinton, they're saying that she's never going to be prosecuted.
[00:07:38.544 --> 00:07:40.866]  These are the words of a former Inspector General.
[00:07:41.326 --> 00:07:45.229]  So with this, our very own Joe Biggs is having an identity crisis.
[00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:47.730]  He is now self-identifying as Mrs. Clinton.
[00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.412]  He went out on the streets to share this with the people of Austin.
[00:07:50.752 --> 00:07:51.373]  Here's a look at that.
[00:08:05.049 --> 00:08:07.571]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:08:10.432 --> 00:08:13.014]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:18.617]  A dead heat for all practical purposes, almost from the start to the finish.
[00:08:18.657 --> 00:08:20.899]  Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders is in a dead heat.
[00:08:21.219 --> 00:08:25.381]  Did you know she won one of the little areas based on a coin toss?
[00:08:25.702 --> 00:08:29.384]  At least six precincts resorted to a coin flip due to a tie.
[00:08:37.665 --> 00:08:39.028]  Sorry, it just keeps happening.
[00:08:42.876 --> 00:08:43.337]  A lozenge.
[00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:45.272]  I swear to God my health is fine.
[00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:49.836]  This is Hillary Clinton reporting for InfoWars.com in downtown Austin, Texas.
[00:08:50.156 --> 00:08:56.442]  Now I am tired, I'm very tired, because I was just in Iowa last night where I beat Bernie Sanders in the Iowa Caucus.
[00:08:56.962 --> 00:09:03.108]  Now you might ask yourself, how can more people show up to Bernie Sanders events and less show up to mine and I still win?
[00:09:03.368 --> 00:09:04.009]  Well guess what?
[00:09:04.429 --> 00:09:07.752]  I got that coin flip game going on right there, every time.
[00:09:08.192 --> 00:09:08.752]  Oh, again.
[00:09:08.772 --> 00:09:11.134]  Oh, well, it was actually tails, but I flipped it really quick.
[00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:13.075]  It's a slight of hand trick.
[00:09:13.395 --> 00:09:14.656]  Us Clintons are really good at that.
[00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:16.957]  We learned how to gamble down in Arkansas.
[00:09:17.317 --> 00:09:26.603]  Well, we're going to go out here and talk to people and ask people if they like me or Bernie Sanders, or if they find it suspicious that I'm really good at flipping coins.
[00:09:27.223 --> 00:09:28.344]  Hey, what's going on, guys?
[00:09:28.404 --> 00:09:29.204]  It's Hillary Clinton.
[00:09:29.224 --> 00:09:30.225]  How are you doing?
[00:09:30.245 --> 00:09:30.865]  I'm kind of tired.
[00:09:30.905 --> 00:09:32.627]  I just got in from Iowa.
[00:09:32.687 --> 00:09:34.267]  Do you like Hillary Clinton?
[00:09:34.988 --> 00:09:35.228]  No.
[00:09:35.648 --> 00:09:36.529]  Well, why don't you like me?
[00:09:37.364 --> 00:09:41.526]  Because you're a liar, a cheater, you're a mean lady.
[00:09:42.186 --> 00:09:43.527]  Have you seen the Benghazi movie?
[00:09:44.307 --> 00:09:44.527]  No.
[00:09:44.867 --> 00:09:45.468]  Yeah, me neither.
[00:09:45.508 --> 00:09:46.708]  I slept through it the first time.
[00:09:46.728 --> 00:09:47.849]  Alright, quick question.
[00:09:47.889 --> 00:09:49.349]  Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders?
[00:09:49.709 --> 00:09:50.150]  Hillary Clinton.
[00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:51.450]  So why are you voting for me?
[00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:53.011]  Oh, are you Hillary?
[00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:53.711]  Well, of course.
[00:09:53.731 --> 00:09:54.532]  You see my pants too?
[00:09:54.572 --> 00:09:55.112]  Come on.
[00:09:55.152 --> 00:09:56.212]  You look beautiful.
[00:09:56.472 --> 00:09:57.513]  Hillary Clinton, yes or no?
[00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:13.280]  You gonna vote for Hillary Clinton for me for president?
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:13.680]  No.
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.501]  Why not?
[00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.401]  I'm as honest as they come.
[00:10:17.122 --> 00:10:19.663]  Uh, well, you know, why am I voting for you?
[00:10:20.063 --> 00:10:20.303]  Yeah.
[00:10:20.423 --> 00:10:20.963]  Girl power.
[00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:22.144]  That's it?
[00:10:23.505 --> 00:10:27.266]  Some people say that I'm gonna be a great person for females.
[00:10:27.286 --> 00:10:27.766]  What do you think?
[00:10:29.047 --> 00:10:32.468]  I don't know enough about Hillary to have an opinion, so... Really?
[00:10:32.488 --> 00:10:33.609]  You don't know anything about Hillary Clinton?
[00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:36.010]  Did you guys hear about what happened last night?
[00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.890]  No, no.
[00:10:37.451 --> 00:10:38.511]  Well, I beat Bernie.
[00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:39.071]  It's 50-50, no?
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.321]  What do you mean, like this?
[00:10:41.501 --> 00:10:42.241]  With a coin toss?
[00:10:42.561 --> 00:10:44.703]  Did you see how I won last night at the Iowa Caucus?
[00:10:45.844 --> 00:10:47.105]  I think you probably cheated.
[00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:48.786]  Well, how, with this?
[00:10:48.946 --> 00:10:50.327]  You think you can beat me at a coin toss?
[00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.869]  What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?
[00:10:54.351 --> 00:10:54.611]  Sir?
[00:10:55.011 --> 00:10:57.913]  The most you ever lost on a coin toss.
[00:10:58.474 --> 00:10:59.134]  Hey, what do you guys think?
[00:10:59.174 --> 00:11:00.675]  Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton?
[00:11:03.938 --> 00:11:05.219]  No, okay, well guess what?
[00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:06.840]  This is how we fix that tiebreaker.
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.361]  This is what they did last night in the Iowa Caucus.
[00:11:08.381 --> 00:11:08.621]  You ready?
[00:11:08.842 --> 00:11:09.382]  Call it in the air.
[00:11:09.582 --> 00:11:10.143]  Best out of five.
[00:11:11.567 --> 00:11:12.468]  Oh, one for me.
[00:11:12.668 --> 00:11:13.289]  Call it in the air.
[00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:15.651]  Oh, there's one.
[00:11:19.134 --> 00:11:19.955]  Oh, there's two.
[00:11:21.896 --> 00:11:22.557]  Oh, tails.
[00:11:23.458 --> 00:11:24.038]  Oh, you got it.
[00:11:24.078 --> 00:11:25.039]  You're winning so far.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.080]  Alright, one more.
[00:11:29.283 --> 00:11:29.483]  See?
[00:11:30.084 --> 00:11:30.905]  I didn't win again.
[00:11:31.225 --> 00:11:32.766]  Well, we both tied again.
[00:11:35.047 --> 00:11:36.027]  I guess I can't win at all.
[00:11:36.767 --> 00:11:37.228]  He won!
[00:11:37.708 --> 00:11:38.508]  Fair and square.
[00:11:38.848 --> 00:11:42.129]  Hillary Clinton loses in a coin toss with this guy.
[00:11:42.349 --> 00:11:43.449]  It's a little suspicious, huh?
[00:11:43.749 --> 00:11:45.669]  I would give this to you, but I'm not Bernie Sanders.
[00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.890]  What do you think?
[00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.090]  Hillary Clinton, me, or Bernie Sanders?
[00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.490]  Me or Bernie, come on.
[00:11:52.491 --> 00:11:52.931]  Come on!
[00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:55.071]  Hey, are you guys gonna vote for Hillary Clinton?
[00:11:56.612 --> 00:11:57.592]  I wouldn't vote for me either.
[00:11:57.632 --> 00:11:58.612]  I'm a lying ass c**t.
[00:12:08.482 --> 00:12:09.582]  The Super Bowl!
[00:12:09.963 --> 00:12:17.466]  Many Americans will argue that this single event brings more people together than any other American pastime.
[00:12:18.286 --> 00:12:27.530]  And just like football fans who are preparing their Super Bowl parties, the military-industrial complex is making preparations of their own.
[00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:39.414]  This year's spectacle won't be the star-studded halftime show, but rather the outrageously overblown security theater that's being staged in and around the event.
[00:12:39.915 --> 00:12:48.358]  According to CBS San Francisco Bay Area News, Super Bowl 50 security is to include F-15 fighter jets
[00:12:48.678 --> 00:12:49.858]  And helicopters.
[00:12:50.258 --> 00:12:55.000]  Again, that's F-15 jets and helicopters at the Super Bowl.
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.661]  If this seems a little over the top, there's good reason for it.
[00:12:58.921 --> 00:13:02.442]  There's much more theatrics here than actual security.
[00:13:02.722 --> 00:13:10.884]  In fact, many, if not all, of the security techniques being used at the event have been proven to be ineffectual by up to 95%.
[00:13:12.065 --> 00:13:15.566]  And yet they've still elevated their routine to include F-15s.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:30.883]  To illustrate the incompetence of the Department of Homeland Security, just look at the testimony given by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Screening in the DHS, Kellyanne Barishi.
[00:13:31.503 --> 00:13:31.683]  Ms.
[00:13:31.723 --> 00:13:35.484]  Barishi, I've asked you, the number of Americans who've traveled to Syria, you don't know.
[00:13:35.564 --> 00:13:37.764]  The number of Americans who may have traveled in return, you don't know.
[00:13:37.824 --> 00:13:41.605]  The number of Syrian refugees who've entered the country in the last year, you don't know.
[00:13:41.865 --> 00:13:44.665]  The number of visa waiver program overstays, you don't know.
[00:13:44.905 --> 00:13:46.866]  The number of visa waiver overstays,
[00:13:47.406 --> 00:13:49.927]  Who may have been to Syria before they came here, you don't know.
[00:13:50.168 --> 00:13:53.069]  And the number of American citizens on the no-fly list, and you don't know.
[00:13:53.329 --> 00:14:03.895]  And yet you are the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Screening Coordination, Office of Policy, Department of Homeland Security, in front of the Oversight Committee, and you can't give us one single number to some, I think, pretty basic questions?
[00:14:04.528 --> 00:14:14.816]  Quoting Daily Caller editor-in-chief Tucker Carlson from a Fox News appearance, he said, These people are not just wrong on the ideas, they're totally incompetent.
[00:14:14.836 --> 00:14:17.218]  These are the people who built the Obamacare website.
[00:14:17.258 --> 00:14:19.600]  They're not good at the details, is part of it.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.203]  And that's why this whole thing ought to scare us a lot.
[00:14:24.232 --> 00:14:32.816]  And we shouldn't ignore the fact that Homeland Security has absolutely no problem keeping the borders wide open for anyone to cross.
[00:14:33.276 --> 00:14:43.741]  Now these same people are bringing to the Super Bowl what the San Jose Mercury News describes as a veritable Fort Knox for the February 7th game.
[00:14:45.282 --> 00:14:47.387]  Metal detectors at every entrance.
[00:14:47.788 --> 00:14:50.754]  Bomb sniffing dogs at all train stops.
[00:14:51.295 --> 00:14:55.424]  Sharpshooters perched on rooftops and cameras everywhere.
[00:14:57.352 --> 00:15:07.358]  The DHS says they will be teaming up with the Air Force to provide air security against, amongst other possible threats, a slow-moving Cessna.
[00:15:07.598 --> 00:15:18.104]  Stories have been circulating demonstrating the special training that these pilots are receiving to aid them when intercepting Cessnas or small aircraft.
[00:15:18.704 --> 00:15:25.346]  That's a lot of media coverage for what is normally considered to be routine NORAD defense drills.
[00:15:25.726 --> 00:15:42.650]  For decades, the United States airspace has been under the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD's Air Defense Program, who have the task to defend our domestic skies with aircraft, which includes F-15 fighters.
[00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:47.711]  Then why make a story out of F-15 training exercises?
[00:15:48.231 --> 00:15:50.653]  Well, the reason is as simple as it gets.
[00:15:51.354 --> 00:15:53.855]  To put a spotlight on the mighty U.S.
[00:15:53.936 --> 00:15:56.297]  military and the domestic Air Force.
[00:15:56.678 --> 00:16:00.461]  For all those watching, the biggest game of the year to see.
[00:16:03.194 --> 00:16:19.383]  Infowars.com has time and time again exposed the fact that the DHS has very little interest in actually keeping anyone secure and a much larger agenda in acclimating the American population to live in a security state.
[00:16:19.944 --> 00:16:28.889]  What we'll be witnessing during the game will be nothing short of security theater broadcast during America's most popular sporting event.
[00:16:29.329 --> 00:16:31.090]  The DHS, as well as the U.S.
[00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:37.573]  military, has a history of paying big money to the NFL to propagandize the U.S.
[00:16:37.653 --> 00:16:38.033]  public.
[00:16:38.514 --> 00:16:42.536]  Countless articles report the relationship between the D.O.D.
[00:16:42.636 --> 00:16:47.898]  and the NFL, including this November 2015 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette report.
[00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:49.039]  The D.O.D.
[00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:56.283]  paid $53 million of taxpayers' money to pro sports for military tributes.
[00:16:57.611 --> 00:17:01.094]  So why does the DOD want to acclimate the public anyway?
[00:17:01.615 --> 00:17:23.216]  On Sunday, May 6, 2012, Infowars.com reported that a leaked US Army document prepared for the Department of Defense contains shocking plans for political activists to be pacified by PSYOP officers into developing an appreciation of US policies.
[00:17:23.516 --> 00:17:27.299]  While detained in prison camps inside the United States.
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:36.167]  Last July, former General Wesley Clark went on MSNBC and called for disloyal Americans to be put in internment camps.
[00:17:36.688 --> 00:17:47.317]  Add this to the fact that Obama, who has chaired Security Council meetings, recently teamed up with the UN to create a global police force to deal with violent extremism.
[00:17:48.118 --> 00:17:54.339]  We as Americans are being pushed and shoved into a global system that is outside of the U.S.
[00:17:54.399 --> 00:17:56.099]  Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:17:56.599 --> 00:18:02.260]  And the security state theater is one way the American public is primed for the occasion.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:09.002]  As people become more used to seeing the military in their everyday life, the easier it will be for the U.S.
[00:18:09.042 --> 00:18:12.382]  to become acclimated into a global system.
[00:18:12.742 --> 00:18:17.103]  A system where dissenters get into a military van and are never heard of again.
[00:18:17.623 --> 00:18:34.029]  So for those of you who are ready to put your brain into relaxation mode and sink into the big game, your relaxed mind will be unconsciously experiencing a paranoid America who lives under the reckless and unaccountable police state.
[00:18:34.469 --> 00:18:40.691]  The DoD wants these security images and emotions to become a normal part of life.
[00:18:41.391 --> 00:18:47.585]  As we see, they are willing to pay big money to broadcast this reality during the Super Bowl.
[00:19:01.368 --> 00:19:06.292]  Shane Steiner's involvement with InfoWarsLife.com truly happened in an organic way.
[00:19:06.432 --> 00:19:15.038]  I went to high school with Shane, his brother, knew his parents well, and he was visiting the office once, hadn't been to the office in years, and said, wow, I notice you're making and selling supplements.
[00:19:15.058 --> 00:19:15.818]  Do these really work?
[00:19:15.858 --> 00:19:20.702]  Because I've tried a lot of supplements as a workout enthusiast, and I really think most of them are
[00:19:21.042 --> 00:19:22.443]  I said, here, take some home, try it.
[00:19:22.543 --> 00:19:29.105]  Well, a few weeks later, he came in blown away and said, I want to buy three boxes of this stuff to give my friends and family.
[00:19:29.505 --> 00:19:31.026]  It's simply amazing.
[00:19:31.066 --> 00:19:32.307]  He said, why does it work so well?
[00:19:32.367 --> 00:19:36.888]  And I said, listen, go to Infowarslife.com, watch the informational videos with Dr. Group and others.
[00:19:37.129 --> 00:19:38.609]  They understand how it all works.
[00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:40.470]  I know that it works for me.
[00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:41.730]  That's all I understand.
[00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:47.052]  The science, the facts, the research, people's testimonials, they're all on Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:47.072 --> 00:19:48.033]  You can check it out for yourself.
[00:19:48.633 --> 00:19:49.733]  I wanted to go to the gym.
[00:19:49.994 --> 00:19:59.837]  I wanted to push myself and work out harder, and that led to me being able to come out and do stuff like the barefooting and the surfing and stuff like that, which I would have never done.
[00:19:59.857 --> 00:20:02.378]  I never would have done that two years ago.
[00:20:02.979 --> 00:20:06.600]  Shane has said over and over again, more than just libido and energy,
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.921]  It made him want to get into the gym more.
[00:20:09.261 --> 00:20:10.722]  It made him want to get in better shape.
[00:20:10.762 --> 00:20:13.363]  And believe me, the Steiners have amazing genetics.
[00:20:13.923 --> 00:20:16.364]  His brother is a world champion steer wrestler.
[00:20:16.685 --> 00:20:20.687]  His dad, Bobby Steiner, is a famous world champion bull rider.
[00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:22.547]  They've got natural genetics.
[00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:27.710]  But when you added this to the mix, in Shane's own words, it took him to the next level.
[00:20:40.003 --> 00:20:41.724]  Shane noticed the mental clarity.
[00:20:42.184 --> 00:20:45.646]  Bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass.
[00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.087]  He's already completely shredded.
[00:20:47.287 --> 00:20:49.929]  I gotta admit, for me, the biggest effect has been libido.
[00:20:50.309 --> 00:20:56.353]  Now, I've never claimed to have a body like some beach model, but back when I was 20, 22 years old and worked out every day, I looked great.
[00:20:56.393 --> 00:21:02.396]  But over the years, being married, having three kids, working 18 hours a day, I gained basically 100 pounds.
[00:21:02.556 --> 00:21:05.678]  And it's been a long process of losing that weight in the last four years.
[00:21:05.858 --> 00:21:08.440]  But if you look at the photos and the videos,
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:09.100]  I don't think so.
[00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:37.933]  This has actually made me feel so good that here lately, about a year ago, I started training jiu-jitsu and that kind of led to doing some boxing and kickboxing.
[00:21:37.953 --> 00:21:50.435]  I mean, it's amazing that two years ago I was on the couch and couldn't even tie my shoes and now I'm training with MMA fighters and just doing stuff that I never thought that I would be doing ever again.
[00:21:50.715 --> 00:21:52.556]  So, Supermail Vitality has
[00:21:53.456 --> 00:21:53.977]  I don't know.
[00:22:03.755 --> 00:22:04.195]  You'll love it.
[00:22:48.119 --> 00:22:57.421]  Bottom line folks, you want to discover the power of super male vitality and super female vitality for yourself by visiting InfoWarsLife.com today or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:23:02.449 --> 00:23:11.954]  Dr. Group called me last night and then this morning and he said no I mean I have it and nobody else has this I can't believe it that the Zika virus didn't come from Latin America.
[00:23:12.814 --> 00:23:20.958]  This is already broken in the news but what's new is that it came from the Rockefeller Foundation they actually own it Zika virus
[00:23:22.009 --> 00:23:24.991]  ATCC registered VR-84TM.
[00:23:25.392 --> 00:23:27.433]  They got it registered, patented, and trademarked.
[00:23:29.135 --> 00:23:32.237]  1948 it was, 1947 it was discovered, patented in 1952.
[00:23:33.358 --> 00:23:36.260]  Remember, I had the author of the U.S.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.561]  and U.N.
[00:23:37.601 --> 00:23:47.249]  ratified biological weapons treaty, Dr. Francis Boyle, saying he's talked to his high-level genetic engineer associates, and they concur, they've taken Zika and souped it up.
[00:23:48.616 --> 00:24:07.055]  It does seem to me and to others, another expert friend of mine, that what we're dealing with here is some type of bio-warfare agent that has been genetically modified, GMO.
[00:24:08.958 --> 00:24:21.284]  So, for that reason, you really can't believe anything the WHO, the Pan American Health Organization, the CDC is telling you.
[00:24:22.264 --> 00:24:29.227]  It also appears, as you correctly point out, that Gates was involved in this.
[00:24:30.408 --> 00:24:37.031]  You know, Bill Engel has the book on Gates that he's basically a genocidalist.
[00:24:38.608 --> 00:24:49.167]  He does have people on his staff with experience having done what I call death science, life scientists who do biowarfare work.
[00:24:51.382 --> 00:24:54.864]  It appears that the U.S.
[00:24:55.124 --> 00:24:59.607]  Advanced Biowarfare Facility at Galveston was involved.
[00:25:00.327 --> 00:25:13.055]  It also appears that the BSL-4 facility at Colorado State that works with GMO-ing mosquitoes was involved.
[00:25:14.095 --> 00:25:20.638]  And that this British high-tech firm Oxitec was involved.
[00:25:21.118 --> 00:25:42.067]  What is critical here is that I believe it was the summer of 2004, there was a scholarly paper published saying that these genetically modified mosquitoes could be dangerous if they were released.
[00:25:43.067 --> 00:25:53.070]  And despite this knowledge, they were released both in Brazil and also in Colombia, deliberately and maliciously.
[00:25:53.330 --> 00:26:04.213]  Right now, I personally would not be traveling down to Latin America until we have some idea precisely what we are dealing with.
[00:26:04.833 --> 00:26:16.071]  And yet I note on Monday, the WHO has convened an emergency meeting where they're going to tell everyone, well, just keep business and travel as usual.
[00:26:17.267 --> 00:26:34.331]  I take it they got those instructions from the CDC, and we know full well the nefarious role that the CDC, the WHO, played in the Black West African Ebola pandemic.
[00:26:34.351 --> 00:26:36.432]  You and I have already been through that.
[00:26:36.512 --> 00:26:38.252]  This so-called Zika
[00:26:39.432 --> 00:26:50.998]  is also transmitted by sexual intercourse, which I think proves that we have a GMO bio warfare agent at work here.
[00:26:51.838 --> 00:26:55.640]  And it is also transmitted by saliva.
[00:26:56.461 --> 00:26:58.542]  And that indicates to me
[00:26:59.503 --> 00:27:09.605]  That we could be dealing with some type of GMO gain-of-function bio-warfare agent.
[00:27:09.705 --> 00:27:11.306]  Namely, that it could jump.
[00:27:12.486 --> 00:27:15.627]  So, we're not sure exactly what's happening, but boy, it is suspicious.
[00:27:15.827 --> 00:27:25.789]  Here's a report from a year and a half ago that Jakari Jackson did, getting into Bill and Melinda Gates and their production of genetically modified mosquitoes.
[00:27:27.537 --> 00:27:30.461]  Now malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitoes.
[00:27:30.961 --> 00:27:34.926]  I brought some here so you could experience this.
[00:27:34.946 --> 00:27:40.172]  We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.
[00:27:41.614 --> 00:27:45.619]  There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
[00:27:48.126 --> 00:27:53.970]  That was Bill Gates laughing about how he plans to use mosquitoes to force Medicaid against malaria.
[00:27:54.391 --> 00:28:03.017]  With horrible side effects accompanying voluntary vaccinations, I for one want to be in control of the needle, whether it comes from a pharmacist or a mosquito's face.
[00:28:03.958 --> 00:28:10.903]  In a world where taking too much cough syrup can send you to the hospital, can't taking too many vaccinations do the same thing?
[00:28:11.583 --> 00:28:15.506]  That's exactly what Nazi scientists were hoping for during World War II.
[00:28:16.687 --> 00:28:20.429]  They wanted to use mosquitoes as bioweapons to poison their opposition.
[00:28:20.949 --> 00:28:25.231]  A dream that was fulfilled when they switched out the mosquitoes for ticks on Plum Island.
[00:28:25.911 --> 00:28:27.231]  Years ago, the U.S.
[00:28:27.251 --> 00:28:33.214]  government brought Nazi mines to the states under Operation Paperclip to carry out various scientific functions.
[00:28:33.894 --> 00:28:37.796]  On Plum Island, Eric Traub experimented with ticks as bioweapons.
[00:28:38.436 --> 00:28:43.859]  In the 1970s, Lyme, Connecticut had an outbreak of what is now known as Lyme disease.
[00:28:44.239 --> 00:28:49.442]  There have been other strange occurrences that many speculate are related to the work done on Plum Island.
[00:28:49.922 --> 00:28:52.424]  So go ahead, opt out of vaccinating your child.
[00:28:52.824 --> 00:28:55.025]  Bill Gates and Eric Traub have the medicine.
[00:28:55.165 --> 00:29:07.352]  If I want to go to another clip of Bill Gates, where he's talking about equations at a TED Talk, and showing what numbers have to be brought down to zero, and he points at humans being brought down to zero, and the crowd laughs.
[00:29:07.952 --> 00:29:10.973]  So you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero.
[00:29:11.773 --> 00:29:25.178]  And that's going to be based on the number of people, the services each person's using on average, the energy on average for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
[00:29:25.638 --> 00:29:30.340]  So let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero.
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:34.101]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[00:29:35.246 --> 00:29:37.687]  That's back from high school algebra.
[00:29:37.707 --> 00:29:38.887]  But let's take a look.
[00:29:39.947 --> 00:29:41.408]  First, we've got population.
[00:29:42.188 --> 00:29:44.428]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[00:29:44.908 --> 00:29:46.509]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[00:29:47.129 --> 00:29:56.231]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[00:29:56.871 --> 00:30:00.192]  This is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve.
[00:30:02.572 --> 00:30:03.514]  And now here he is.
[00:30:03.634 --> 00:30:05.758]  New weapon to fight Zika, the mosquito.
[00:30:06.199 --> 00:30:13.654]  When it comes to killing humans, no other animal even comes close, Bill Gates, whose foundation fights disease globally, has written.
[00:30:14.702 --> 00:30:33.774]  So, Hiding in Plain View, and then we have Zika virus, A-T-C-C-R-B-R-8-4, owned by the Rockefeller Foundation, blood from experimental forest sentinel rhesus monkeys, Uganda, 1947, and now it pops up in Latin America, and tell us what it supposedly does.
[00:30:33.814 --> 00:30:34.735]  Dr. Rupp, you've got the floor.
[00:30:34.895 --> 00:30:43.342]  We know how bad GMO crops are, but GMO animals, we know about transhumanism, we know about all the experimentation with genetic codes being spliced into animals.
[00:30:44.222 --> 00:30:45.763]  Mosquitoes are a vector.
[00:30:45.803 --> 00:30:46.564]  It's just like a needle.
[00:30:46.604 --> 00:30:47.685]  It's just like a vaccine.
[00:30:47.765 --> 00:30:51.248]  So all of the people out there saying, well, I don't want to be vaccinated anymore.
[00:30:51.488 --> 00:30:52.268]  Well, guess what?
[00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:56.672]  You're going to have genetically modified mosquitoes running around and flying around everywhere.
[00:30:56.752 --> 00:30:58.193]  And he admits that's his plan.
[00:30:58.413 --> 00:30:59.555]  I think with the Zika virus, it's
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.663]  Well, number one, Intrexron's stock has gone up.
[00:31:17.703 --> 00:31:22.926]  The genetically modified mosquito production company and... Oh, isn't that just cute?
[00:31:23.507 --> 00:31:30.271]  And now, all of a sudden, they said today that there's an Indian corporation that has two vaccines.
[00:31:30.311 --> 00:31:36.636]  So with this... World's first Zika virus vaccine made in India, claimed scientist Bill and Melinda Gates funding it.
[00:31:37.338 --> 00:31:38.199]  Thank God they love us.
[00:31:38.799 --> 00:31:41.821]  Also, you have to look at what's going on in Brazil.
[00:31:42.102 --> 00:31:45.104]  Why are all these mosquitoes being released in Brazil?
[00:31:45.484 --> 00:31:49.307]  Well, you have the Olympics in Brazil, Summer Olympics in 2016.
[00:31:49.808 --> 00:32:00.936]  You're going to have representatives and people, contestants, athletes, fans from every country in the world in one central location.
[00:32:01.356 --> 00:32:03.078]  And that's where they're releasing this virus.
[00:32:03.678 --> 00:32:08.163]  So it's a perfect vector to spread this disease all over.
[00:32:08.183 --> 00:32:17.634]  Now they say it can be... But even better, then everybody's got to have the vaccine when you, quote, get your shots to go to Brazil, and then who knows what'll be in the Bill and Melinda Gates developed Zika vaccine.
[00:32:18.595 --> 00:32:28.418]  As a matter of fact, just today they confirmed somebody in Texas got the Zika virus from sexually transmitted and now they're saying through saliva as well.
[00:32:28.738 --> 00:32:33.080]  So the solution to that for everybody listening is just keep your immune system strong.
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.301]  You know, get lots of sleep, don't stress out, take vitamin C.
[00:32:37.421 --> 00:32:41.002]  Take some zinc, by the way, which is an anthroplex.
[00:32:41.362 --> 00:32:42.542]  Keep your body cleansed.
[00:32:42.622 --> 00:32:44.683]  Keep your self-healing mechanisms strong.
[00:32:45.083 --> 00:32:46.764]  There's a lot of different herbs out there.
[00:32:46.784 --> 00:32:48.704]  Oregano oil, iodine.
[00:32:49.164 --> 00:32:55.146]  They also admit that one flu shot cuts your immune system by 50% for at least a year.
[00:33:02.179 --> 00:33:11.442]  You guys have the exclusive for which is a product called Deep Cleanse and why I'm so excited about it is it's a unique formula almost like the iodine crystals.
[00:33:11.542 --> 00:33:15.304]  We have two unique products that nobody in the world has.
[00:33:15.684 --> 00:33:27.468]  One of the most amazing ingredients in the world and it's called Shilajit and it's actually known as blood of the mountain or rock sweat because thousands of years ago, as a matter of fact, this ingredient
[00:33:27.668 --> 00:33:34.092]  Was only given to the elite of the elite thousands of years ago up in the Himalayan mountains and in Tibet.
[00:33:34.112 --> 00:33:37.935]  And we wanted to put this in stuff for a couple years, but we couldn't get an organic form.
[00:33:38.115 --> 00:33:38.335]  Right.
[00:33:38.435 --> 00:33:39.476]  I mean, let's explain.
[00:33:39.516 --> 00:33:42.658]  I mean, this stuff's so good, we couldn't put it out for years.
[00:33:42.938 --> 00:33:51.387]  Right, so I had to actually, it's kind of like the iodine crystals, finding a source deep in the earth that we could get the cleanest source available.
[00:33:51.827 --> 00:34:01.397]  But in Tibet and in Nepal and in the Himalayan mountains, thousands of years ago they found, they watched these monkeys and during the summer months the monkeys would go up into the mountains.
[00:34:01.418 --> 00:34:02.659]  Now you're being racist against monkeys.
[00:34:02.699 --> 00:34:03.340]  And they would pick
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.242]  This black substance from the mountains.
[00:34:06.702 --> 00:34:13.207]  And so in Russia, they actually, it grows in Russia and the mountains and in the Himalayas and only in the summer.
[00:34:13.307 --> 00:34:21.514]  And Shilajit is actually the decomposition of seven, up to 7,000 different medicinal herbs.
[00:34:21.574 --> 00:34:28.239]  So it decomposes, all these different herbs decompose in the Himalayan mountains and the volcanic soil up there.
[00:34:28.499 --> 00:34:32.522]  And what happens in the summertime... So it's almost like an oil from
[00:34:33.383 --> 00:34:36.085]  Yes, it's high in fulvic acid, it's high in humic acid.
[00:34:36.125 --> 00:34:40.449]  Because they're always claiming oil is really from decomposed animals and plants.
[00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:45.433]  There is some oil that is based from fossils, but most of it's really abiotic.
[00:34:45.854 --> 00:34:49.837]  So this is a true fossil source?
[00:34:49.917 --> 00:34:50.618]  I mean, explain it to me.
[00:34:51.318 --> 00:34:51.658]  It is.
[00:34:52.058 --> 00:34:57.379]  It's really the decomposition, like I said, of over 7,000 different medicinal herbs and plants.
[00:34:57.539 --> 00:35:01.340]  And with the rocks and the pressure deep in the mountains, it freezes.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:06.361]  And during the summertime and the pressures build it up, it oozes out.
[00:35:06.461 --> 00:35:08.021]  So it literally oozes out of the mountain.
[00:35:08.041 --> 00:35:08.861]  It's like rock sap.
[00:35:09.221 --> 00:35:10.222]  It's like rock sap.
[00:35:10.262 --> 00:35:13.402]  It's black and it's highly nutritious.
[00:35:14.222 --> 00:35:16.843]  Even in the 1980s, when the Olympic
[00:35:17.563 --> 00:35:19.884]  Athletes in Russia were accused of being on steroids.
[00:35:19.924 --> 00:35:27.265]  They found out that they were actually been given Shilajit because it works as an anabolic as well and it builds muscles.
[00:35:27.465 --> 00:35:28.525]  It's a big dose in there.
[00:35:28.545 --> 00:35:38.268]  The second big main ingredient in there is a volcanic zeolite concentrate and what this formula is designed to do, the Shilajit and the zeolites have a real strong negative charge.
[00:35:38.728 --> 00:35:43.649]  All the metals and chemicals and PCBs and VOCs have positive charges.
[00:35:44.449 --> 00:35:52.559]  So these go in, they grab it, and then they safely eliminate it through the body so you can become healthy.
[00:35:52.599 --> 00:35:56.543]  I mean, this is an amazing formula.
[00:35:56.683 --> 00:36:02.550]  I wish I actually had it, but because this was an exclusive InfoWars Life product, you're the only one in the world that has.
[00:36:03.171 --> 00:36:11.075]  This formula now and you know there is going to be a limited supply available when you sell out because you can only harvest this once a year.
[00:36:11.235 --> 00:36:12.275]  How do people take it?
[00:36:12.335 --> 00:36:14.656]  How is it recommended that this be done?
[00:36:14.756 --> 00:36:16.477]  Just a daily dose?
[00:36:16.737 --> 00:36:18.458]  Yeah, daily dose.
[00:36:18.558 --> 00:36:19.919]  The instructions are on the label.
[00:36:19.959 --> 00:36:22.400]  You know of course I kind of modify it for
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.942]  It depends on what your lifestyle is.
[00:36:24.982 --> 00:36:33.407]  I mean, honestly, the best thing to do is for you to avoid all these chemicals and toxins in your environment and try to identify them and start slowly reducing them.
[00:36:33.868 --> 00:36:41.553]  But personally, I'm going to probably take it every day, every other day, and I'll probably go with about a dropper full to maybe two dropper fulls.
[00:36:42.693 --> 00:36:44.934]  And I don't expose myself to any chemicals.

[00:36:59.497 --> 00:37:00.457]  So support them folks.
[00:37:00.657 --> 00:37:01.257]  This is a war.
[00:37:06.058 --> 00:37:09.799]  Recently, a woman in Houston was sentenced to life in prison for sex trafficking.
[00:37:10.239 --> 00:37:19.282]  A very harsh reminder that modern day slavery is still alive and well, and many people think of these things as something that happened overseas, or something such as slavery being extinct.
[00:37:19.762 --> 00:37:23.183]  But it is happening, and it is happening right here in the United States of America.
[00:37:23.523 --> 00:37:28.025]  And to talk about this, we have a professor from the University of Nebraska, Triani Tidball.
[00:37:28.385 --> 00:37:31.346]  So, you're a professor at the University of Nebraska.
[00:37:31.526 --> 00:37:35.067]  Can you tell us what got you first involved in combating human trafficking?
[00:37:36.516 --> 00:37:45.383]  Well, before I came to teach at the University of Nebraska, I had been living in Sri Lanka, which is where home is for me.
[00:37:45.403 --> 00:37:50.067]  I was born in Sri Lanka and raised there, and I came here to go to school.
[00:37:51.423 --> 00:38:00.431]  So I never knew at that time growing up that there was human trafficking in Sri Lanka and all forms of trafficking until 2008.
[00:38:00.471 --> 00:38:02.333]  Let's see, 2000 was when George Bush
[00:38:06.897 --> 00:38:19.406]  The president coined that name, human trafficking, to cover everything from child prostitution, to child labor, to unsafe migration of women, and organ trafficking, and child soldiers, and all those things.
[00:38:20.066 --> 00:38:21.688]  And we had them on Instagram.
[00:38:21.708 --> 00:38:24.450]  So, you know, I had seen all of it.
[00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:30.194]  And growing up there, I had been on my own trying to do some things to help people out.
[00:38:30.314 --> 00:38:35.838]  So I guess it wasn't a formal, you know, here I go to start working on trafficking.
[00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:39.971]  So it wasn't just one day, you know, you woke up and you realized this.
[00:38:40.011 --> 00:38:43.112]  It was a slow, gradual process that this came to your attention.
[00:38:44.153 --> 00:38:49.175]  Yeah, because you see it in front of you and then you realize it's not right, you know?
[00:38:50.015 --> 00:38:50.255]  Yes.
[00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:55.717]  So when you're talking about the way you came about to realizing this, what are some warning signs?
[00:38:55.737 --> 00:39:00.439]  You know, if people are watching this video and they're looking for warning signs of human trafficking, what should they look for?
[00:39:01.584 --> 00:39:06.486]  I think the first thing is you've got to realize that children need to be children, that they have rights.
[00:39:06.927 --> 00:39:08.688]  They do not need to be sold.
[00:39:09.148 --> 00:39:12.209]  The foster care system in America is broken.
[00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:14.150]  Why is there such a system?
[00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:16.071]  It's because families are dysfunctional.
[00:39:16.492 --> 00:39:17.832]  Why are families dysfunctional?
[00:39:17.872 --> 00:39:19.493]  Because they're basically selfish.
[00:39:19.573 --> 00:39:22.194]  So, you know, if you have children, you've got to take care of them.
[00:39:22.234 --> 00:39:24.295]  You've got to look after them, make sure they're safe.
[00:39:26.089 --> 00:39:41.294]  People due to some of their own issues like maybe drug addiction or some other kinds of issues, they start using their children to be able to continue their habits and then the children run away, they're picked up by traffickers.
[00:39:41.354 --> 00:39:48.977]  So when you're asking for science, I think if you see families that are not taking care of their children, then everyone's at risk.
[00:39:49.437 --> 00:39:53.519]  The family's at risk for selling their kids and the children are definitely at risk.
[00:39:54.545 --> 00:40:11.784]  In terms of child labor or labor trafficking, I mean, that's another whole area that's very, you know, prevalent in America, because a lot of people don't want to do the kinds of jobs they used to do, like meatpacking factories or, you know, roofing or whatever.
[00:40:11.804 --> 00:40:13.847]  And they try to find ways to
[00:40:14.187 --> 00:40:14.508]  I think so.
[00:40:30.306 --> 00:40:32.068]  Undocumented, documented.
[00:40:32.108 --> 00:40:33.689]  I mean, what is it?
[00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:36.192]  People, it's all a supply-demand model.
[00:40:36.792 --> 00:40:40.375]  If there is no demand, nobody's going to come across the border to work.
[00:40:40.736 --> 00:40:45.500]  If there's no demand, nobody's going to buy children for sex or even women for sex.
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:49.444]  So, I guess that's the issue that I see.
[00:40:50.185 --> 00:40:51.606]  Yes, and you touched on something there.
[00:40:51.687 --> 00:41:03.839]  It's larger than just sex trafficking because we hear about things like sweatshops across the seas and people think it's very prevalent over there, but what you're saying that we could have a similar type of situation going on right here in the United States?
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:05.620]  Right, right.
[00:41:05.701 --> 00:41:06.902]  Oh, there definitely is.
[00:41:07.382 --> 00:41:10.305]  America is a huge demand
[00:41:12.065 --> 00:41:17.488]  You know, a demand country for all these things that they want.
[00:41:18.008 --> 00:41:21.269]  They want sex with children.
[00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:30.394]  So as long as they want that, children are at risk of being, you know, either taken and sold or they're running away and they're, you know, sold.
[00:41:31.174 --> 00:41:32.675]  Any of those things can happen.
[00:41:33.789 --> 00:41:41.955]  Now, I know it's a very broad topic, but let's say, is there any particular area or any type of situation that you would find a child trafficked in?
[00:41:42.056 --> 00:41:46.179]  Is there a particular area of the country or a type of event where these things happen?
[00:41:48.035 --> 00:41:59.319]  Okay, well I think every city, I mean across America, every single year the Department of Justice says there's between 200,000 and 300,000 children between 12 and 14 taken into sex trafficking.
[00:42:04.801 --> 00:42:08.206]  Now, we're not talking about some refugee kids coming across the border.
[00:42:08.527 --> 00:42:10.890]  That's a different number, a different statistic.
[00:42:11.331 --> 00:42:14.215]  We are talking about that little girl next door.
[00:42:14.255 --> 00:42:19.863]  We're talking about just the regular American girl between 12 and 14 is at risk.
[00:42:20.524 --> 00:42:23.586]  So, this is right across the whole country.
[00:42:23.606 --> 00:42:28.688]  I mean, I'm just finishing up a research study of some girls in Nebraska that got trafficked.
[00:42:29.308 --> 00:42:36.312]  It can be in cities, it can be in rural areas, as long as, you know, men want to buy, girls are going to be available.
[00:42:36.332 --> 00:42:48.358]  And if somebody suspects trafficking, you said it could be your next door neighbor, you know, the girl down the street, you know, what should somebody do if they think something is amiss with the relationship between the child and the caretaker?
[00:42:50.461 --> 00:42:57.583]  Well, maybe you would talk to the girl if you can.
[00:42:58.784 --> 00:43:06.986]  Very often they're scared to speak, but I think if you can befriend her and find out what's going on and then maybe you might want to.
[00:43:07.787 --> 00:43:11.508]  The thing is that most girls who are trafficked, they don't trust law enforcement.
[00:43:12.268 --> 00:43:24.934]  Sometimes law enforcement in certain states and cities are not trained because whenever they see a girl that's been sold for sex, they see her as a prostitute rather than a prostituted person.
[00:43:25.755 --> 00:43:31.717]  And very often she does not get the, you know, there's so much stigma, she's afraid to tell police.
[00:43:33.078 --> 00:43:38.383]  But, you know, FBI is really good to help you if the child is under 18.
[00:43:38.483 --> 00:43:47.630]  But if the child is just turned 18, then suddenly this victim becomes a criminal because we criminalize prostitution in America.
[00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:53.715]  And we don't ever look at it as somebody being prostituted versus a prostitute.
[00:43:53.755 --> 00:44:00.041]  You know, these are 95% of the people that we call prostitutes are prostituted people.
[00:44:00.481 --> 00:44:01.963]  They are under a pimp.
[00:44:02.124 --> 00:44:03.666]  They don't want to do what they're doing.
[00:44:03.726 --> 00:44:04.487]  They are forced.
[00:44:05.289 --> 00:44:05.869]  Absolutely.
[00:44:05.889 --> 00:44:10.817]  Now, in your personal opinion, I hear people talk about the legalization of prostitution.
[00:44:11.137 --> 00:44:15.204]  Would you think that legalization of prostitution would help alleviate the problem at all?
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:17.700]  No, it'll make it much worse.
[00:44:17.781 --> 00:44:26.464]  It'll make it perfectly fine for people then to buy girls who have been taken, who have been forced into it.
[00:44:27.004 --> 00:44:31.505]  A pimp can go scot-free, and the Johns, or the... I hate to use the word John, by the way.
[00:44:31.866 --> 00:44:35.367]  That's a nice word that has been created by the men who buy.
[00:44:36.187 --> 00:44:40.588]  Because I don't know about you, but my, you know, we have a lot of Jones in our family.
[00:44:40.608 --> 00:44:43.469]  My father-in-law, my brother-in-law, his children.
[00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:48.470]  So this man, the name John has been taken to make it soft.
[00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:52.170]  And then the girls are called Natashas to make them exotic.
[00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:55.151]  So that's really, you know, very unfair.
[00:44:55.651 --> 00:45:00.232]  Anyway, men who buy, I call them buyers, they're very safe.
[00:45:00.892 --> 00:45:04.213]  So, because there's hardly any laws in this country to protect
[00:45:04.997 --> 00:45:07.578]  The, you know, protected girls, they kind of protect them.
[00:45:07.598 --> 00:45:10.479]  So if the girl is over 18, she's a criminal.
[00:45:11.339 --> 00:45:16.841]  And I think it will make, if prostitution becomes legal, it would make it very easy for men to buy girls.
[00:45:17.302 --> 00:45:19.903]  And nobody ever asks, is this girl trafficked?
[00:45:19.983 --> 00:45:20.923]  Is this girl false?
[00:45:21.003 --> 00:45:25.825]  Is this girl doing this totally, you know, not by her own?
[00:45:26.545 --> 00:45:28.766]  Nobody wants, no woman wants to sell her body.
[00:45:28.786 --> 00:45:31.107]  I mean, I know this for a fact.
[00:45:31.638 --> 00:45:31.819]  Yes.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.506]  Now, Professor Tidball, we have about a minute left.
[00:45:34.566 --> 00:45:36.532]  Can you tell us about your personal endeavors?
[00:45:36.592 --> 00:45:39.600]  I know you have a website and tell us all the things that you're doing.
[00:45:40.396 --> 00:45:40.616]  Me?
[00:45:42.418 --> 00:45:44.499]  I'm just doing like a drop in the bucket.
[00:45:44.519 --> 00:45:47.562]  I always feel like I should be doing a whole lot more.
[00:45:47.962 --> 00:45:53.166]  But at the university, I'm teaching a class on human rights, social justice, and the media.
[00:45:54.007 --> 00:45:55.668]  And it's extremely popular.
[00:45:55.688 --> 00:45:57.449]  I have a lot of faith in the millennials.
[00:45:57.789 --> 00:46:01.112]  They want to be a part of the social change that they want to see.
[00:46:01.933 --> 00:46:07.017]  And I also have a student organization that I'm the RSO, you know, the faculty advisor for.
[00:46:07.717 --> 00:46:12.361]  Call New SAMS, which stands for Nebraska University Students Against Modern Day Slavery.
[00:46:13.382 --> 00:46:24.972]  And I'm also involved with, you know, doing some work with the state government and done some work on a task force or two, doing some research on my own.
[00:46:25.452 --> 00:46:28.015]  So there's quite a lot going on, but not enough.
[00:46:28.695 --> 00:46:28.995]  Okay.
[00:46:29.015 --> 00:46:31.678]  Well, thank you so much, Professor Sriyani Tidball.
[00:46:32.098 --> 00:46:34.100]  And we look forward to more reports from you in the future.
[00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:46.612]  This is a protest.
[00:46:47.333 --> 00:46:49.156]  And this is a riot.
[00:46:49.556 --> 00:46:53.382]  If you can't tell the difference, then you are part of the problem.
[00:46:53.782 --> 00:46:54.743]  Infowars.com
[00:47:03.007 --> 00:47:04.009]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:06.833]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.114 --> 00:47:14.966]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.469]  We're good.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:12.124]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have the Austin Police Chief, Art Acevedo, a very interesting fellow here in studio with us for the Balance of the Hour.
[00:49:12.144 --> 00:49:14.004]  We're just in here turning up his audio.
[00:49:14.325 --> 00:49:17.646]  And the reason I like having him in studio is he'll come in studio.
[00:49:19.227 --> 00:49:22.008]  Other Austin Police Chiefs that I ran into weren't really bad people.
[00:49:23.015 --> 00:49:28.836]  But they were very cloistered, let's say, kind of in their high tower and were really kind of afraid of the media.
[00:49:29.476 --> 00:49:34.577]  Art, you have not been afraid of the media and you have a very, very interesting past.
[00:49:35.257 --> 00:49:39.198]  Of course, you're a Cuban immigrant to this country fleeing Fidel Castro.
[00:49:39.238 --> 00:49:42.559]  So that's why you've always pointed out to me that, you know, you love liberty and freedom.
[00:49:42.859 --> 00:49:44.359]  So it's good to have you here with us.
[00:49:44.379 --> 00:49:47.199]  But you're also a popular police chief across the country.
[00:49:47.619 --> 00:49:49.620]  And I've got to say, as Austin's grown,
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:50:01.367]  Normally, they say police departments get worse as they get bigger because it's hard to control them, but I've really got to say it's true, and I think the press says it, the public say it, that Austin is a model police department.
[00:50:01.707 --> 00:50:02.208]  Well, thank you.
[00:50:02.228 --> 00:50:08.592]  That means a lot to me, especially coming from a person that has been a watchdog of government for his entire adult life.
[00:50:09.312 --> 00:50:10.293]  We're definitely not perfect.
[00:50:10.393 --> 00:50:17.737]  We know we have our issues, we have our challenges, but by and large, I wouldn't trade these officers for any in the country.
[00:50:17.757 --> 00:50:18.378]  They're phenomenal.
[00:50:18.638 --> 00:50:19.498]  Well, you got in some trouble.
[00:50:19.578 --> 00:50:20.779]  I mean, not a lot of trouble a few years ago.
[00:50:20.799 --> 00:50:23.520]  You said, listen, at least our police aren't shooting people in the back every day.
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.501]  You know, talking about other departments.
[00:50:25.561 --> 00:50:37.227]  And again, other departments, I'm not even attacking them, but compared to a lot of these other departments, Austin also has really nice police on average, but they also, you know, tend to do their jobs at the same time compared to other cities I've been in.
[00:50:37.647 --> 00:50:39.288]  Yeah, I mean, and it's important.
[00:50:39.308 --> 00:50:43.570]  You know, the city of Austin is a, it's a progressive city.
[00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:44.611]  It's a successful city.
[00:50:44.651 --> 00:50:45.251]  It's a community.
[00:50:45.311 --> 00:50:47.072]  It's very much engaged, as you know.
[00:50:55.183 --> 00:51:09.810]  In April of 2014, the Flint City Council voted 7-1 over the course of the next 21 months to change their water source from the treated water of Lake Huron and the Detroit River to the Flint River.
[00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:24.877]  Over the course of the next 10 months, water safety protocols concerning the addition of phosphate to ensure corrosive metal compounds within the Flint River would not harm the people of Flint, Michigan were largely ignored.
[00:51:25.137 --> 00:51:36.749]  Residents have reported that they've found dead bodies floating in this river before as well as GM and other companies kept the Dow chemical they would dump a lot of their waste into this river at one time.
[00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:45.659]  So residents were just shocked to learn that this is where they were going to be getting their water supply from and of course we know there was a lot of issues with how that water was being treated.
[00:51:46.019 --> 00:51:54.065]  The way EPA operates in general is that people who are causing trouble by doing their job are simply not allowed to do their job.
[00:51:54.765 --> 00:51:56.867]  They are silenced as Mr. Del Toro was.
[00:51:56.987 --> 00:52:06.694]  He was told, as Leanne said, by the ethics officer at EPA not to speak to anyone from Flint or about Flint.
[00:52:06.734 --> 00:52:11.177]  He told me that himself before he was unable to talk to me anymore.
[00:52:11.437 --> 00:52:19.578]  Largely ignored until local Flint Michigan mother Leanne Walters noticed that her children were becoming very sick.
[00:52:20.051 --> 00:52:22.712]  My home used to be a place of comfort and safety for my family.
[00:52:23.232 --> 00:52:26.773]  It used to be what a home should be, a place of peace and protection from the outside world.
[00:52:27.554 --> 00:52:32.776]  That was taken from us, and not just from my family, but from every home and every citizen in Flint.
[00:52:33.736 --> 00:52:35.437]  Now my home is known as Ground Zero.
[00:52:36.237 --> 00:52:38.498]  The people in Flint now stand with the people in D.C.
[00:52:38.558 --> 00:52:47.221]  who suffered their own lead crisis a decade ago because we now know the horror of poison running through our taps and the negligence of the agencies paid to protect us.
[00:52:48.141 --> 00:52:53.625]  I had three tests done by the City of Flint using extra steps that tend to minimize lead in water.
[00:52:54.366 --> 00:52:57.609]  Those numbers were 104 parts per billion, 397 parts per billion, and 707 parts per billion.
[00:53:02.208 --> 00:53:07.410]  I contacted the EPA and started working with Miguel Del Toro and Jennifer Cooks at the EPA.
[00:53:08.271 --> 00:53:11.052]  Mr. Del Toro was very thorough and knowledgeable in assisting me.
[00:53:11.832 --> 00:53:20.816]  I told Mr. Del Toro I did not believe there was corrosion control in the water, provided him documentation about this fact, and he verified my findings, and he was furious.
[00:53:21.777 --> 00:53:26.799]  Mr. Del Toro questioned the MDEQ, and at first they lied, and then later admitted the truth.
[00:53:29.491 --> 00:53:30.371]  I figured out that Ms.
[00:53:30.411 --> 00:53:36.732]  Crooks was aiding the MDEQ with her lies, and Mr. Del Toro was the only one willing to address the problem.
[00:53:37.592 --> 00:53:43.093]  I requested a copy of Mr. Del Toro's report, and I made it public because people had a right to know.
[00:53:43.113 --> 00:53:55.315]  In a meeting I had with MDEQ, Leanne Schechter-Smith bragged to me about how Mr. Del Toro had been handled, that his report was flawed, and that there would be no final report.
[00:53:56.036 --> 00:53:58.256]  This was the ultimate betrayal for the citizens.
[00:53:59.324 --> 00:54:06.829]  Susan Hedman cared more about policy than the welfare of an entire community while punishing and silencing the one person that was willing to help us.
[00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:16.236]  The EPA's LCR National Report from 2006 states that the lack of system response for lead exceedance is especially true to inform the public.
[00:54:16.776 --> 00:54:19.178]  It is done less than one-third of the time.
[00:54:20.039 --> 00:54:24.021]  From my research, I have found that this is not a Flint problem or a rare anomaly.
[00:54:24.141 --> 00:54:25.623]  This is a national problem.
[00:54:26.503 --> 00:54:29.726]  Only 10 states test accurately and according to the LCR.
[00:54:29.746 --> 00:54:36.652]  21 states do not reveal their sampling instructions and 19 states have testing similar to loopholes to the Michigan ones.
[00:54:37.313 --> 00:54:51.586]  You should know what happened and it should move from being a question to actually document it because how can you discipline someone or hold them accountable if you do not have clear information of failure of their job?
[00:54:51.886 --> 00:54:56.892]  And we do have clear standards, we have clear accountabilities, we have a clear path forward.
[00:54:57.332 --> 00:55:06.683]  We are working in conjunction with both the city, the state, and the federal government to resolve this so it does not happen again.
[00:55:06.963 --> 00:55:11.429]  What's the cost of treating the water with the appropriate amount of phosphates?
[00:55:12.574 --> 00:55:16.938]  When the switch was made, there was actually no phosphate added at all.
[00:55:16.978 --> 00:55:18.720]  There was no corrosion control.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:20.821]  Federal law was not followed.
[00:55:21.062 --> 00:55:21.922]  No phosphates at all.
[00:55:21.942 --> 00:55:24.425]  Is the water now safe to drink?
[00:55:26.747 --> 00:55:29.549]  We cannot guarantee at this point in time the water is safe to drink.
[00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:34.794]  When did EPA Administrator McCarthy first visit Flint about this crisis?
[00:55:36.055 --> 00:55:38.878]  I believe that yesterday was Administrator McCarthy's first visit to Flint.
[00:55:39.548 --> 00:55:42.491]  It wasn't until yesterday that she's visited for the first time.
[00:55:43.873 --> 00:55:44.994]  So the day before this hearing.
[00:55:45.454 --> 00:55:52.142]  So Administrator McCarthy knew about this crisis for eight months, but didn't visit Flint until the day before a congressional hearing.
[00:55:52.242 --> 00:56:00.371]  Their response, would you conclude, is because of a lack of clarity in the federal regulations, or lack of enforcement, or both?
[00:56:02.378 --> 00:56:13.743]  In a written letter I wrote to EPA Office of Water, I said point blank that the only thing I can conclude is that they don't care about children lead poisoned from drinking water.
[00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:27.610]  This fumbling and secretive response to the crisis by Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality, the EPA, the Governor of Michigan, and ultimately the neglect of the federal government and the President of the United States
[00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:34.234]  ...resulted in the severely high level of lead poisoning of 6,000 to 12,000 children.
[00:56:34.374 --> 00:56:37.836]  It may have caused an outbreak of Legionnaire's disease, killing 10.
[00:56:38.677 --> 00:56:46.922]  All roads that lead to the debacle in Flint, Michigan, dead end at the doorstep of Michigan's criminal and pitiful department.
[00:56:47.022 --> 00:56:47.362]  I don't know.
[00:57:05.882 --> 00:57:14.869]  Many months after water testing revealed that Flint's water was unsafe to drink, that Governor Snyder finally declared a state of emergency.
[00:57:15.129 --> 00:57:20.634]  Federal bureaucracies, state agencies, and local officials are willfully damaging
[00:57:20.834 --> 00:57:28.755]  And in some cases killing American citizens due to their negligence and refusal and ability to face up to their crimes.
[00:57:29.095 --> 00:57:50.039]  In a true republic, the current EPA overseeing the poisoning of Flint, Michigan's citizens and their children, overseeing a current toxic waste spill in Greensboro, Georgia, and responsible for polluting the Animas River in Colorado would be immediately dismantled rather than disciplined like a wet dog.
[00:57:50.399 --> 00:57:57.707]  Are the people paying right now in Flint for water they cannot wash in and cannot use and cannot drink?
[00:57:57.847 --> 00:58:01.692]  Are they paying water bills and is it a part of the recovery?
[00:58:01.932 --> 00:58:03.273]  You said you want to make them whole.
[00:58:03.934 --> 00:58:04.715]  Is that part of it?
[00:58:04.995 --> 00:58:11.282]  Why would they be paying for water that they cannot even use that is poisoning them?
[00:58:12.083 --> 00:58:18.385]  Strong words on the Hill change nothing, and the majority of American people loathe the spectacle.
[00:58:18.685 --> 00:58:20.906]  Lead poisoning is a growing epidemic.
[00:58:21.106 --> 00:58:25.107]  Pennsylvania has far higher levels of lead exposure than Flint, Michigan.
[00:58:25.408 --> 00:58:31.290]  Of course, you won't hear filmmaker Michael Moore going after Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolfe.
[00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:35.451]  That would diminish the media charade waged against the Republicans.
[00:58:35.831 --> 00:58:36.392]  It's simple.
[00:58:36.632 --> 00:58:37.112]  The U.S.
[00:58:37.172 --> 00:58:43.318]  government is a bloated circus of incompetence, and those responsible are too big to jail.
[00:58:43.619 --> 00:58:45.661]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[00:58:53.348 --> 00:58:54.609]  Well, that's it for our show tonight.
[00:58:54.669 --> 00:58:58.253]  I'm Jakari Jackson from the InfoWars Command Center, and we'll see you again tomorrow.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.001]  Knockout is back.
[00:59:05.341 --> 00:59:16.447]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep, restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:16.847 --> 00:59:18.548]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:19.048 --> 00:59:28.173]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:28.573 --> 00:59:30.334]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:30.894 --> 00:59:31.775]  It's the same price
[00:59:32.495 --> 00:59:41.380]  As leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece, it has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult, and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
