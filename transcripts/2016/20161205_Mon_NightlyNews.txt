[00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.100]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.761]  It is Monday, December 5th, 2016, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:26.922]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.603 --> 00:00:43.369]  Tonight, CBS labels InfoWars a fake news website and says Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist who believes the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax.
[00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:44.510]  Wait a minute, he never said that.
[00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:52.020]  Meanwhile, the rest of the mainstream media is flipping out over Donald Trump's phone call to Taiwan.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.986]  I think the conversation that happened this week with the president of Taiwan was a courtesy call.
[00:00:58.026 --> 00:01:03.912]  She reached out to the president-elect and he took the call from the democratically elected leader of Taiwan.
[00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:09.915]  Then, ISIS says Inauguration Day will be Bloody Friday.
[00:01:10.295 --> 00:01:15.577]  And a look at two extraordinary films that China does not want you to watch.
[00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:21.619]  The government in China is doing a terrible thing, which is comparable to what the Nazis did.
[00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:25.921]  All that, plus much more, up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.954]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:08.018]  Well, it's another week and another onslaught of the fake news stories that are out there.
[00:03:08.098 --> 00:03:16.464]  And of course, CBS is joining other mainstream people on the attack, now labeling InfoWars as a fake news website.
[00:03:16.944 --> 00:03:23.049]  They put out a little slide, a piece that's entitled, Don't Get Fooled By These Fake News Sites.
[00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:24.830]  This is CBS News, okay?
[00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.412]  They brought you Rathergate and Saddam Hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction.
[00:03:30.932 --> 00:03:44.138]  So they also have InfoWars and Alex Jones alongside The National Report or The Onion or Real News Right Now, all of which say on their About section that, hey, this is all in jest.
[00:03:44.518 --> 00:03:46.399]  The stories on the site are all satire.
[00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.261]  Of course, The Onion is one of the most well-known satirical news websites on the Internet.
[00:03:51.861 --> 00:04:00.549]  So now they're saying Alex Jones, radio host and conspiracy theorist, is along the lines with the fake news outlets.
[00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:14.321]  I mean, regardless of the fact that we forced the mainstream media to cover a lot of stories, like the ammo purchase, of course, by some different government agencies, we forced them to talk about certain stories that they refuse to discuss.
[00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:17.263]  Now, as Paul Joseph Watson points out in this article,
[00:04:18.544 --> 00:04:30.810]  CBS, it's very ironic that they would call anybody fake news because of course in 2004, 60 Minutes produced critical documents of President George W. Bush's service in the Air National Guard.
[00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.651]  The documents turned out to be complete forgeries.
[00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:39.013]  The scandal was so bad it forced veteran news anchor Dan Rather to resign.
[00:04:39.473 --> 00:04:42.595]  CBS News also dutifully spread the fake news
[00:04:43.155 --> 00:04:48.358]  Before the invasion of Iraq, that Saddam Hussein had mobile biological weapons labs.
[00:04:48.458 --> 00:04:53.961]  It's a story that turned out to be a completely contrived claim from a notoriously unreliable source.
[00:04:54.381 --> 00:04:59.344]  And of course, this is the kind of fake news that when it happens, millions of people die.
[00:04:59.744 --> 00:05:00.124]  Okay?
[00:05:00.344 --> 00:05:02.986]  Completely destabilize the Middle East.
[00:05:03.746 --> 00:05:05.968]  Hundreds of thousands in Iraq, thousands of U.S.
[00:05:06.028 --> 00:05:08.370]  troops, it ruined an entire continent.
[00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.614]  So that's the kind of fake news that you have to worry about from the lamestream media.
[00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:20.620]  Now, John Rappaport has a story up at InfoWars.com talking about, hey, let's not forget about the fact that CBS
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.044]  We'll conveniently forget how it aided and abetted the CDC by censoring real news.
[00:05:27.805 --> 00:05:30.566]  Of course, the movie Vaxxed came out.
[00:05:30.907 --> 00:05:33.588]  It caused a huge scandal at the CDC.
[00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:41.234]  Longtime researcher William Thompson confessed that he and colleagues committed gross fraud in a study of the MMR vaccine.
[00:05:41.954 --> 00:05:46.077]  He admitted the evidence showed the vaccine led to a higher risk of autism in children.
[00:05:46.537 --> 00:05:48.739]  The finding was intentionally buried
[00:05:49.239 --> 00:05:51.401]  And the vaccine was, of course, given a free pass.
[00:05:51.501 --> 00:05:56.205]  So, of course, audiences who are seeing this film have been totally stunned by these revelations.
[00:05:56.245 --> 00:06:03.170]  But, of course, the lamestream media once again has continually squelched any kind of pushback against vaccinations.
[00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.551]  And could they cause harm?
[00:06:04.992 --> 00:06:10.236]  You know, meanwhile, they're paying millions every single year in vaccine injury related cases.
[00:06:10.776 --> 00:06:13.699]  So, John Rappaport says, you know, let me take you back a little bit
[00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:17.422]  To an interview that he had a few years ago with Cheryl Atkinson.
[00:06:17.482 --> 00:06:24.007]  She was a reporter, CBS investigative reporter, a badass, one of the best in the business as far as I'm concerned.
[00:06:24.388 --> 00:06:33.055]  She was working on a swine flu story and she discovered that the CDC had secretly stopped counting cases of the swine flu.
[00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:37.379]  While of course they were continuing to warn Americans about its unchecked spread.
[00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:39.841]  Oh, it's just massive pandemonium!
[00:06:40.361 --> 00:06:41.762]  Gotta go out and get your flu shot.
[00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:43.664]  Swine flu is everywhere.
[00:06:43.724 --> 00:06:44.865]  People are all gonna die.
[00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:48.467]  I mean, I'm sure you all remember how dire the story was about the swine flu.
[00:06:49.087 --> 00:06:53.390]  But the CDC wasn't even tracking any new cases of the swine flu.
[00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.133]  And that's the CDC's main job, is to count cases and report the numbers.
[00:06:58.473 --> 00:07:01.815]  So here's what Atkison told John Rappaport at the time.
[00:07:01.855 --> 00:07:02.116]  She said,
[00:07:12.142 --> 00:07:13.083]  We're swine flu.
[00:07:13.283 --> 00:07:16.626]  In fact, the swine flu nor any sort of flu at all.
[00:07:17.286 --> 00:07:20.428]  And so initially, CBS was very interested in this story.
[00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:26.273]  One of the executives said it was the most original story he'd seen on the whole swine flu epidemic.
[00:07:26.293 --> 00:07:30.736]  But then, of course, a lot of people started to push back and they never aired it at all.
[00:07:30.756 --> 00:07:32.317]  I never even went there.
[00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:45.107]  But of course, she says that they continued to pump out numerous stories, pumping out this idea of an epidemic, not one that would shed any original angles, any new light on this height.
[00:07:45.627 --> 00:07:45.948]  Fair.
[00:07:46.308 --> 00:07:48.289]  It was accurate and it was legally approved.
[00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:49.310]  It was a heck of a story.
[00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.193]  But the CDC kept the true swine flu stats secret.
[00:07:53.393 --> 00:08:01.239]  It meant that many in the public took and gave their children an experimental vaccine that may not have been necessary.
[00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:10.506]  And of course, as they're pushing all of this pandemonium of the swine flu, then they cut to a commercial from the vaccine makers.
[00:08:10.567 --> 00:08:17.813]  And of course, that's half the reason why your fake news, lamestream media will not cover certain stories, much like the
[00:08:18.553 --> 00:08:20.374]  Organ harvesting going on in China.
[00:08:20.915 --> 00:08:23.016]  Margaret Howell is going to be joining me in studio later on.
[00:08:23.036 --> 00:08:23.997]  We're going to talk about that.
[00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:29.661]  We're also going to be interviewing someone later this week who has been trying to get this out for decades.
[00:08:30.061 --> 00:08:31.222]  So this is a huge scandal.
[00:08:31.402 --> 00:08:34.624]  But you're not going to hear about that but from the lamestream media.
[00:08:35.225 --> 00:08:39.868]  And now Paul Craig Roberts is writing, you know, wondering if the U.S.
[00:08:39.908 --> 00:08:43.371]  government is behind the fake news media attacks on Donald Trump.
[00:08:44.051 --> 00:08:48.155]  This is Eric Zeus, and he says he's brought it to the attention that U.S.
[00:08:48.255 --> 00:08:59.226]  intelligence officials have placed a story in BuzzFeed, which of course everyone knows is a Democratic Party mouthpiece, that the Russian government used fake news to get Donald Trump elected president.
[00:08:59.927 --> 00:09:02.989]  BuzzFeed has his whole story out saying, you know, U.S.
[00:09:03.029 --> 00:09:07.591]  intelligence officials believe Russia helped disseminate fake news stories and propaganda.
[00:09:08.132 --> 00:09:08.912]  Another U.S.
[00:09:08.952 --> 00:09:09.813]  official says this.
[00:09:10.273 --> 00:09:12.654]  Another intelligence official says that.
[00:09:12.894 --> 00:09:16.236]  And so they never go on to identify any of these intelligence people.
[00:09:16.296 --> 00:09:20.118]  They just go on to state as fact that from these intelligence sources.
[00:09:20.158 --> 00:09:21.419]  So it must be true.
[00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:24.261]  You know, no one's putting their their name out there, their face on camera.
[00:09:25.117 --> 00:09:26.558]  Who are these people?
[00:09:26.778 --> 00:09:33.160]  And they're portraying the President-elect of the United States to be a Putin stooge, a tool of Russia.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.680]  How dangerous is this?
[00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:43.123]  And let's not forget that it was just on Sunday that the Pentagon once again came out saying that Russia is the number one threat to the United States.
[00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:44.884]  So here again, they're really trying to
[00:09:45.888 --> 00:09:46.608]  It's dangerous.
[00:09:46.929 --> 00:09:51.371]  The situation in this country is very dangerous to say the president-elect is a Putin stooge.
[00:09:51.731 --> 00:09:54.193]  Meanwhile, the Pentagon is saying Russia is our number one threat.
[00:09:54.913 --> 00:10:10.202]  Now, you'll recall Romney actually made this point in 2012 in a debate with President Obama, and it was like one of the zingers in the debate because Obama was like, oh, it's not the 1980s anymore, Romney, Russia.
[00:10:10.282 --> 00:10:11.243]  But now, all of a sudden,
[00:10:12.263 --> 00:10:15.265]  You know, this isn't a joke, and Russia is of course the number one threat.
[00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:24.109]  So here again, this is going to be another fake news story that they're pushing out, which will drive us into nuclear war with Russia, has the potential to do that.
[00:10:24.169 --> 00:10:30.853]  So it could be another fake news story that ends up killing millions of people, hundreds of thousands, ruining an entire continent.
[00:10:31.073 --> 00:10:38.137]  But they don't care, and they've proven that in the past, that they're willing to take the story and run with it, regardless of the consequences.
[00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:41.565]  Now we've got another story up at InfoWars.com.
[00:10:41.605 --> 00:10:50.778]  Paul Joseph Watson is reporting about how the German government is more worried about Islamophobia after a woman was brutally raped and murdered.
[00:10:50.978 --> 00:10:53.582]  Her body was dumped and found in a river.
[00:10:53.602 --> 00:10:55.184]  This happened last month.
[00:10:55.865 --> 00:11:03.310]  So a teenage Afghan asylum seeker was arrested last week on Friday for this alleged rape and murder of a medical student.
[00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.752]  She was a volunteer there at the migrant center.
[00:11:07.092 --> 00:11:13.676]  But the victim's father is a senior EU official, and he is a vehement supporter of the migrant policy.
[00:11:14.357 --> 00:11:18.199]  And so you're seeing this pushback, which was really bizarre.
[00:11:18.239 --> 00:11:18.820]  Her family
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:30.904]  In lieu of anyone sending any flowers or anything for her funeral, they were suggesting that people make donations to charities that are working to bring in even more refugees into Germany.
[00:11:31.564 --> 00:11:38.826]  I mean, this is like every single movie that you see where it's like the super rich parent who doesn't care about their child and they'll...
[00:11:40.507 --> 00:11:42.050]  To the expense of their agenda.
[00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:43.994]  All that matters is the rich parent's agenda.
[00:11:44.675 --> 00:11:49.063]  Regardless if your kid just was raped and murdered by a migrant, you're just gonna say...
[00:11:50.106 --> 00:11:51.067]  You know what, donate.
[00:11:51.247 --> 00:11:53.288]  That's what she would have wanted, to just donate.
[00:11:53.328 --> 00:11:55.529]  I mean, how cucked do you have to be?
[00:11:56.049 --> 00:12:10.416]  And then, of course, now the German government's response was to warn any German citizens who might be angry over this incident, if they express that anger on Facebook, the German government is on the lookout for Islamophobic hate speech.
[00:12:11.738 --> 00:12:14.159]  Right now on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:14.419 --> 00:12:20.561]  German government worries about Islamophobia after Muslim refugee allegedly rapes and kills a woman.
[00:12:21.001 --> 00:12:32.446]  The German government has reacted to the shocking news about a Muslim migrant who raped and killed a 19-year-old woman by warning that it would be watching Facebook posts carefully for instances of Islamophobia.
[00:12:33.166 --> 00:12:42.828]  Strange response not to monitor what the alleged rapist and killer would be associated with, but instead potential responses of hate towards that rapist and killer.
[00:12:43.048 --> 00:12:51.589]  A teenage Afghan asylum seeker was arrested on Friday for the alleged rape and murder of medical student in Freeburg, which took place last month.
[00:12:51.869 --> 00:12:58.690]  That's right, so don't monitor the refugees or warn them against raping and murdering people.
[00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:02.231]  You need to tell people to be more tolerant in case this happens.
[00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:11.555]  The victim's father is a senior EU official and a supporter of the migrant policy that has seen over a million refugees pour into Germany over the last year.
[00:13:12.075 --> 00:13:17.638]  Well, not to politicize the death of his daughter, but I'm curious if he'll change his stance on that.
[00:13:17.938 --> 00:13:18.858]  But apparently not.
[00:13:19.138 --> 00:13:19.879]  The aftermath...
[00:13:20.419 --> 00:13:20.639]  I think?
[00:13:41.727 --> 00:13:42.968]  Kind people.
[00:13:43.348 --> 00:13:50.371]  But this act of kindness, I think, is going to be viewed as an act of weakness by violent refugees who want to come into the country.
[00:13:50.651 --> 00:13:55.453]  The German government's response was to warn German citizens who expressed anger over the incident on Facebook.
[00:13:55.833 --> 00:14:01.136]  Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel asserted that the murder should not be used to stoke Islamophobia.
[00:14:01.676 --> 00:14:07.079]  No, it should be used to stoke more tolerance, apparently, which I admit is big-hearted.
[00:14:07.119 --> 00:14:07.960]  That is kindness.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.363]  But I don't think the refugees are going to look at it that way, who are allegedly raping and murdering people.
[00:14:14.663 --> 00:14:15.544]  More from Gabriel.
[00:14:15.964 --> 00:14:20.847]  Such horrible murders already happened before the first Afghan or Syrian refugee arrived here.
[00:14:21.687 --> 00:14:25.991]  We will not allow incitement after such violent crimes no matter who commits them.
[00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:28.593]  This logic totally befuddles me.
[00:14:29.053 --> 00:14:35.599]  So because rape and murder already happens in your country, you're going to be tolerant with more rape and murder.
[00:14:36.359 --> 00:14:42.925]  The German government's own statistics show that violent crimes have skyrocketed since over a million migrants have arrived in the country.
[00:14:43.385 --> 00:14:51.356]  Those concerns are not shared by Merkel's government, which is more preoccupied with hunting down German citizens for inflammatory Facebook posts.
[00:14:51.756 --> 00:14:56.963]  Well, she'll lose and the German people will not tolerate this anymore.
[00:14:57.264 --> 00:14:59.567]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[00:15:00.782 --> 00:15:05.629]  Remember when Joe Biden announced the covert plan to target Russia?
[00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:10.376]  Well, now ISIS is taking a play out of Joe Biden's book.
[00:15:10.416 --> 00:15:15.984]  They've announced that they are going to be attacking, they're going to be
[00:15:16.525 --> 00:15:19.388]  Launching a series of attacks on Trump's inauguration day.
[00:15:19.428 --> 00:15:21.189]  They're calling it Bloody Friday.
[00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:28.696]  So here we have now this terrorist organization that is announcing in advance when their attacks are going to take place and where.
[00:15:29.336 --> 00:15:35.241]  And we're also being told that they've recruited a number of new English-speaking operatives in recent months.
[00:15:35.281 --> 00:15:38.984]  And this is in a bid to communicate those messages ahead of the event.
[00:15:39.765 --> 00:15:50.069]  So, you know, obviously this is to stoke fear and to control where people move, you know, their responses to things, of course, to have special forces be out in full effect.
[00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:56.511]  So it's not just, you know, the Inauguration Day protesters that you're going to have to worry about, but also, of course, ISIS.
[00:15:57.812 --> 00:16:05.395]  Now, according to reports, ISIS has expanded production of special editions of official videos with English subtitles in recent weeks.
[00:16:06.175 --> 00:16:09.076]  And this is with a view to reinforcing targets on U.S.
[00:16:09.657 --> 00:16:10.117]  soil.
[00:16:10.717 --> 00:16:11.037]  Hmm.
[00:16:11.557 --> 00:16:15.259]  This made me think of another story that was reported back in October.
[00:16:15.339 --> 00:16:22.823]  Now, we've been telling you this for quite some time, but here I wanted to pull it directly from the Daily Beast and Salon.
[00:16:23.103 --> 00:16:28.185]  So people out there who are watching this video can't say, oh, that's just right-wing propaganda.
[00:16:28.485 --> 00:16:29.966]  So it's coming out of the Daily Beast.
[00:16:30.906 --> 00:16:33.669]  Pentagon paid for fake Al-Qaeda videos.
[00:16:34.169 --> 00:16:37.632]  So this was a controversial PR firm in the UK.
[00:16:37.652 --> 00:16:43.577]  They were given over half a billion dollars to run a top-secret propaganda program in Iraq.
[00:16:44.377 --> 00:16:46.739]  This is coming out of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.
[00:16:47.964 --> 00:16:58.209]  This included short TV segments made in the style of Arabic news networks and fake insurgent videos which could be used to track the people who watch them, according to a former employee.
[00:16:58.369 --> 00:17:03.172]  Oh, and I'm sure that those videos were never spread around the internet as fact.
[00:17:03.392 --> 00:17:06.934]  Anything from these insurgents to track the people who watch these.
[00:17:07.654 --> 00:17:09.276]  I mean, this is how this stuff gets picked up.
[00:17:09.316 --> 00:17:13.259]  This is why we've seen a lot of those videos going, doesn't that look like they're in front of a green screen?
[00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:19.525]  I mean, it's just so difficult to trust the fake news, but they want to attack people who are exposing this stuff.
[00:17:19.565 --> 00:17:22.447]  Meanwhile, they're actually creating fake news.
[00:17:23.808 --> 00:17:30.693]  Now, a story out of the Daily Mail is talking about how a 15-year-old boy was detained in Iraq.
[00:17:30.773 --> 00:17:38.839]  He was there at a packed football stadium and he was ready with his suicide vest, but he says he got scared and he couldn't do it.
[00:17:38.899 --> 00:17:40.560]  He was acting suspiciously, so they got him.
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:45.504]  So this was just less than a day after another child suicide bombing in Turkey took place.
[00:17:45.864 --> 00:17:49.247]  A 13-year-old killed at least 51 at a Kurdish wedding.
[00:17:49.887 --> 00:17:52.251]  Both of these kids were cubs of the caliphate.
[00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:57.979]  So these are children who are brainwashed by ISIS handlers and then they're being told to go in and blow themselves up.
[00:17:58.159 --> 00:18:00.863]  This kid is, you know, now he's talking about it and...
[00:18:01.721 --> 00:18:11.151]  You know, hoping to get some therapy, I guess, but this is the concern you have with people who just say, oh, they're just women and children and oh, no, don't be ridiculous.
[00:18:11.211 --> 00:18:20.541]  There are, ISIS has already said that they are training people to go in and children to be soldiers of the caliphate.
[00:18:21.121 --> 00:18:22.322]  Now there's another story.
[00:18:23.163 --> 00:18:23.823]  Check this out.
[00:18:24.183 --> 00:18:34.171]  So Al Qaeda, the moderate Syrian rebels, are so afraid of Donald Trump becoming president and being abandoned by him and the U.S., of course, who's been supporting both sides.
[00:18:35.192 --> 00:18:39.015]  They're actually looking at some other options because they think the U.S.
[00:18:39.075 --> 00:18:44.259]  is going to end their support of funding terror around the world.
[00:18:44.519 --> 00:18:44.920]  Stick around.
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.461]  Margaret Howell joins me next.
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:46.203]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:19:46.884 --> 00:19:48.465]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:19:48.865 --> 00:19:53.848]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:19:54.208 --> 00:19:59.652]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:20:00.052 --> 00:20:06.636]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:20:07.277 --> 00:20:08.438]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:20:09.278 --> 00:20:11.219]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.501]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:20:14.942 --> 00:20:18.564]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:20:18.744 --> 00:20:21.306]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:20:21.366 --> 00:20:33.714]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:20:33.934 --> 00:20:39.055]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:40.496]  It's bound.
[00:20:40.776 --> 00:20:41.776]  It's not absorbable.
[00:20:42.196 --> 00:20:46.758]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:20:46.978 --> 00:20:51.879]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:20:52.239 --> 00:20:55.940]  It's such a game changer if you'll just research iodine for yourself.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.681]  It's a fact that the federal government in the Midwest back in the 20s
[00:20:59.241 --> 00:21:08.206]  Mandated a grungier form of iodine to the salt because people had low IQs, they had huge goiters, major problems directly connected to it.
[00:21:08.386 --> 00:21:12.048]  There are some studies that show a 15 point increase, others show even higher.
[00:21:12.208 --> 00:21:25.656]  But it really is crazy to realize that this is something that is so deficient in our food chain, so deficient in our played out fields where different crops are being grown, but the federal government isn't educating people and telling them about it.
[00:21:25.856 --> 00:21:37.399]  That's why for a limited time, I want to encourage everyone to go to Infowarslife.com and get 20% off on the best nascent iodine out there from our research, Truly Pure Survival Shield X2.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.260]  Again, that's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.461]  Thank you for joining us in this brief news update.
[00:21:43.841 --> 00:21:48.743]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:21:48.823 --> 00:21:49.983]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:52.724]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:21:52.884 --> 00:21:53.104]  Of course!
[00:22:15.742 --> 00:22:19.404]  You've got to have vitamin C, you've got to have iodine to live, you've got to have water to live.
[00:22:19.744 --> 00:22:30.249]  Iodine is key, you must have it, but consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com, or call toll free, we can answer your questions, 888-253-3139.
[00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:32.630]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[00:22:43.925 --> 00:22:45.387]  It's a fight for our minds.
[00:22:46.048 --> 00:22:47.971]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[00:22:48.311 --> 00:22:52.517]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:22:52.657 --> 00:22:56.002]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[00:22:56.082 --> 00:22:57.644]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:23:02.475 --> 00:23:04.436]  We have been here before.
[00:23:04.876 --> 00:23:05.477]  Recently.
[00:23:05.757 --> 00:23:14.001]  In 2011, former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was indicted on 52 counts of child molestation.
[00:23:14.141 --> 00:23:17.963]  He was eventually convicted of 45 counts of sexual abuse.
[00:23:18.163 --> 00:23:22.505]  The Penn State scandal took down the careers of head coach Joe Paterno.
[00:23:22.765 --> 00:23:31.412]  School President Graham Spanier and Athletic Director Tim Curley, all of which looked the other way on Sandusky's criminal activity.
[00:23:31.492 --> 00:23:37.578]  Mike McQueary testified that he saw Sandusky sexually abusing a young boy in the Penn State showers in 2001.
[00:23:38.298 --> 00:23:47.846]  McQueary then told head coach Joe Paterno, but as we've learned, Paterno and other top administrators never reported it to authorities, and the boy never came forward until now.
[00:23:50.519 --> 00:23:57.302]  Well, I could say that, you know, I have done some of those things.
[00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.472]  I have horsed around with kids.
[00:24:20.852 --> 00:24:23.974]  I have showered after workouts.
[00:24:24.154 --> 00:24:31.878]  I have hugged them and I have touched their leg without intent of sexual contact.
[00:24:32.199 --> 00:24:45.807]  This all began when in 1977, Sandusky founded Second Mile, a non-profit organization for underprivileged youth, ultimately operating as a front for Sandusky's criminal perversion.
[00:24:46.127 --> 00:24:48.969]  Second Mile was praised by George H.W.
[00:24:49.009 --> 00:24:58.295]  Bush and Rick Santorum, and served by a roster of professional athletes on its honorary board including Arnold Palmer, Frank O'Harris, and Jack Hamm.
[00:24:58.515 --> 00:25:02.598]  The Second Mile's charity revenue in 2009 was $3 million.
[00:25:02.638 --> 00:25:10.323]  Donations came from Bank of America, The Hershey Company, Merck, State Farm, and PepsiCo, just to name a few.
[00:25:10.603 --> 00:25:17.588]  The other shoe began to drop on these 2nd Mile donors when Pittsburgh radio host Mark Madden unleashed this bombshell.
[00:25:17.828 --> 00:25:23.111]  I hear there's a rumor that there will be a more shocking development from the 2nd Mile Foundation.
[00:25:24.132 --> 00:25:26.293]  And hold on to your stomachs boys, this is gross.
[00:25:26.413 --> 00:25:29.615]  I will, you know, I'll use the only language I can.
[00:25:30.396 --> 00:25:34.959]  That Jerry Sandusky and 2nd Mile were pimping out young boys to rich donors.
[00:25:37.688 --> 00:25:42.652]  I was being investigated by two prominent columnists even as I speak.
[00:25:43.293 --> 00:25:56.664]  Radar Online had reported a witness interviewed by federal authorities in the widening Penn State investigation claims he saw Jerry Sandusky in one of the school's prominent boosters sexually abusing boys on a private plane.
[00:25:56.784 --> 00:25:58.626]  The witness was interviewed by the U.S.
[00:25:58.746 --> 00:26:01.348]  Postal Inspectors with the FBI present.
[00:26:01.588 --> 00:26:14.775]  RadarOnline.com had broken the news that a new investigation into a pedophile ring was now being conducted by federal authorities, but instead of opening a can of worms, the Sandusky case was dropped into the memory hole.
[00:26:14.935 --> 00:26:25.701]  Sandusky had not only brought Penn State down, but his sick lifestyle was endangering the sponsors of the NFL, mainstream media, and quite possibly the District of Criminals.
[00:26:25.981 --> 00:26:27.862]  John Bown, for InfoWars.com.
[00:26:29.275 --> 00:26:37.545]  Exactly as I predicted five months ago, the political class, the establishment, and the media are doing everything imaginable to sabotage Brexit.
[00:26:37.625 --> 00:26:45.313]  So they had a by-election in Richmond, an area in London that voted 70% to remain in the EU, and imagine my shock!
[00:26:45.874 --> 00:26:47.435]  The pro-Remain candidate won.
[00:26:47.475 --> 00:26:50.957]  First off, when are we having a second by-election?
[00:26:51.057 --> 00:26:52.458]  I mean, that's how you want it, right?
[00:26:52.698 --> 00:26:56.921]  Just keep making everyone vote again and again until you get the result you want.
[00:26:56.961 --> 00:27:02.804]  But then the media came out and hailed it as a stunning reversal of Brexit sentiment across the entire country.
[00:27:02.924 --> 00:27:09.468]  Right, so 20,000 posh twats in Richmond represents the country better than 17.4 million Brexit voters.
[00:27:11.349 --> 00:27:12.190]  I don't think so.
[00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:19.554]  So you got 70% of the vote for Remain, but only 50% of the vote for the Remain candidate, Sarah Olney.
[00:27:19.674 --> 00:27:20.795]  Let me do the maths here.
[00:27:20.955 --> 00:27:26.018]  You lost 20% of the vote in an area that was already overwhelmingly pro-Remain.
[00:27:26.078 --> 00:27:28.700]  How on earth is that a repudiation of Brexit?
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:33.244]  Olney said that Brexit supporters were intolerant, backward-looking and divisive.
[00:27:33.565 --> 00:27:39.651]  A regurgitation of the narrative that anyone who voted for Leave is a racist bigot who just hates immigrants.
[00:27:39.811 --> 00:27:51.362]  Isn't it interesting that Olney and her supporters liked a virtue signal about how tolerant and pro-diversity they are, while choosing to live in the whitest area of London possible?
[00:27:51.462 --> 00:28:00.626]  Yeah, if you're so convinced about the wonderful cultural enrichment that mass immigration brings, why do you reside in the area with the least number of immigrants?
[00:28:00.706 --> 00:28:02.446]  Pretty racist if you ask me.
[00:28:02.587 --> 00:28:10.030]  And while we're on the subject of intolerance, it's Vote Remain supporters who have been the most intolerant of Brexit voters.
[00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.810]  Disowning them.
[00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:11.630]  Smearing them.
[00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.151]  Publicly shaming them.
[00:28:13.351 --> 00:28:14.792]  Attacking them in the street.
[00:28:14.972 --> 00:28:18.253]  Wishing deadly illnesses upon their babies.
[00:28:18.533 --> 00:28:23.474]  Olney also said that she would, quote, vote to override the referendum result.
[00:28:23.534 --> 00:28:24.714]  So let me get this straight.
[00:28:25.034 --> 00:28:35.556]  Your party has the word Democrats in its name, yet you're talking about overriding the democratic will of the British people.
[00:28:35.636 --> 00:28:37.496]  Yeah, that's not very democratic.
[00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:47.118]  Olney had to be dragged off the air by her spin doctor during a radio show because she made a complete tit out of herself, proving she knew nothing about the EU.
[00:28:47.278 --> 00:28:52.823]  There was no clear manifesto for what happened to, you know, our membership of the single market or what happened to... Yes, there was!
[00:28:52.843 --> 00:28:55.985]  The Remain campaign said we were going to leave the single market if we voted out.
[00:28:58.607 --> 00:28:59.508]  Yes, they did.
[00:28:59.528 --> 00:29:00.148]  They repeated it.
[00:29:00.229 --> 00:29:05.253]  Every single leading member of the Remain campaign said a vote to leave the EU was a vote to leave the single market.
[00:29:05.533 --> 00:29:06.854]  Nothing unclear about that at all.
[00:29:10.791 --> 00:29:12.955]  I'm really sorry but Sarah only has to leave now.
[00:29:13.035 --> 00:29:13.716]  No she doesn't.
[00:29:13.816 --> 00:29:19.405]  Sarah if you want to be elected Member of Parliament I think you should probably be able to answer some simple questions about your policy.
[00:29:19.445 --> 00:29:20.887]  Can you get Sarah back on the line please?
[00:29:21.539 --> 00:29:22.139]  Sorry about that.
[00:29:22.179 --> 00:29:23.460]  We've waited an hour.
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:24.501]  I don't know who you are.
[00:29:24.521 --> 00:29:26.462]  We've waited an hour to have this interview.
[00:29:26.542 --> 00:29:31.024]  If she doesn't want to answer questions from a radio station, perhaps she's not fit to be an MP.
[00:29:31.264 --> 00:29:36.267]  And they had the temerity to call Vote Leave supporters low information.
[00:29:36.307 --> 00:29:44.651]  This all happened after a ruling by a bunch of corrupt Europhile High Court judges who said that when we all voted for the government to implement Brexit,
[00:29:45.271 --> 00:29:48.937]  It didn't really mean that we were voting for the government to implement Brexit.
[00:29:48.997 --> 00:29:56.688]  That's strange because when I received this letter from the government before Brexit, it said the government will implement what you decide.
[00:29:56.868 --> 00:30:01.535]  It didn't say your vote is worthless because we'll just keep having referendums
[00:30:01.775 --> 00:30:03.236]  Until we get the result we want.
[00:30:03.356 --> 00:30:17.462]  It didn't say, your vote is worthless because a bunch of tw**tish celebrities, corrupt judges and lefty politicians will whine and b**ch for months to try and subvert and sabotage a democratic result because they lost and their butt hurt about it.
[00:30:17.582 --> 00:30:27.986]  It didn't say, your vote is worthless because your own supposed representatives will demand a parliamentary vote and then vote against the democratic decision of their own constituents.
[00:30:28.186 --> 00:30:33.530]  It didn't say, your vote is worthless because we'll insert endless amendments to water it down.
[00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:38.354]  To the point where it's unrecognisable from what you thought you were voting on in the first place.
[00:30:38.494 --> 00:30:45.179]  And now we're about to have another bunch of corrupt Europhile judges tell us once again that our vote meant nothing.
[00:30:45.339 --> 00:30:50.143]  While the media lectures us to not be mean to the corrupt Europhile judges.
[00:30:50.243 --> 00:30:56.348]  While Remain pressure groups celebrate the High Court ruling as a victory for parliamentary sovereignty.
[00:30:56.548 --> 00:31:03.432]  As they support the very entity, the EU, that has completely eviscerated parliamentary sovereignty.
[00:31:03.573 --> 00:31:12.178]  While Remain pressure groups literally call themselves the People's Challenge, while sh**ing all over the will of the people.
[00:31:12.238 --> 00:31:19.222]  While super wealthy elitists like Gina Miller swoop in to save the country from the baying Brexit mob.
[00:31:19.383 --> 00:31:21.424]  What part of the word leave don't you understand?
[00:31:21.744 --> 00:31:29.935]  The baying Brexit mob being poor people across the country who have lost their jobs and seen their communities crippled because of the EU.
[00:31:29.975 --> 00:31:38.686]  While the media constantly invokes an MP that was murdered by a neo-Nazi lunatic to suggest somehow that Brexit supporters were responsible.
[00:31:38.766 --> 00:31:45.210]  Her stance on refugees and immigration attracted the attention of those with sinister, extreme views.
[00:31:45.391 --> 00:31:52.996]  While the media blames Brexit supporters for a hate crime wave that never happened, hate crime prosecutions actually fell.
[00:31:53.096 --> 00:31:58.880]  While the BBC and Sky News compete with each other to see who can suck the most globalist d***.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:13.603]  While Tony f***ing Blair, the war criminal, rises from whatever godforsaken crypt he's been hiding in to scorn the silly plebs for daring to defy the globalists who know what's best for them.
[00:32:13.683 --> 00:32:25.985]  While thousands of Libtards, the same ones who protested against Blair's bloodletting, crowd the streets to virtue signal about how we need to remain in the EU because love... or something.
[00:32:29.931 --> 00:32:31.132]  Yeah, word of advice.
[00:32:31.332 --> 00:32:39.053]  Attaching your political cause to an arbitrary emotion that has nothing to do with reality isn't an argument.
[00:32:39.173 --> 00:32:49.356]  While those same libtards side with the very multi-millionaires, Wall Street banks and crony capitalist financial institutions that they supposedly despise.
[00:32:49.756 --> 00:32:59.924]  If the people in this country think that they're going to be cheated, they're going to be betrayed, then we will see political anger the likes of which none of us in our lifetimes have ever witnessed in this country.
[00:33:02.526 --> 00:33:08.010]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.050]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.451 --> 00:33:16.436]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula, 30 servings, fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[00:33:16.756 --> 00:33:17.817]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.877 --> 00:33:18.818]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all of the essential amino acids, all of the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.346]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.568 --> 00:34:49.088]  A thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!

[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.690]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.031 --> 00:36:46.696]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.

[00:37:07.711 --> 00:37:16.654]  Donald Trump has changed the game by skipping the prestitute media and taking right to Twitter with his thoughts.
[00:37:17.114 --> 00:37:20.555]  And this is putting the mainstream news and journalists in a tizzy.
[00:37:20.955 --> 00:37:23.216]  And joining me now is Rob Due to talk about this.
[00:37:23.316 --> 00:37:31.919]  Rob, Trump is explaining why he's tweeting so much and it's pretty obvious to all of us because he knows that he can't count on the media to accurately depict
[00:37:32.259 --> 00:37:33.520]  What it is he's doing and saying.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.222]  And it's funny, the media making such a big issue out of this.
[00:37:36.242 --> 00:37:39.604]  We saw this right when he became president, or when he was elected president.
[00:37:40.344 --> 00:37:42.706]  They were just so mad that he tweets, that he leaves the press.
[00:37:42.726 --> 00:37:48.870]  Like, he is treating them like second class citizens because they've done nothing but when they've had the ball, they haven't carried it.
[00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:49.851]  They haven't produced.
[00:37:50.151 --> 00:37:51.712]  They haven't given us the real story.
[00:37:51.732 --> 00:37:54.213]  They've done nothing but lie and cause subterfuge.
[00:37:54.253 --> 00:37:56.495]  So I see why he's acting this way.
[00:37:56.835 --> 00:37:58.216]  He's sick and tired of the firewall.
[00:37:58.497 --> 00:38:04.543]  And even somebody I don't like, and usually never agree with, Dick Cheney, feels the same way.
[00:38:04.563 --> 00:38:06.264]  He's like, look, they made you guys obsolete.
[00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:07.525]  In fact, I think we have a clip of that.
[00:38:07.766 --> 00:38:08.587]  Let's go to that clip now.
[00:38:08.607 --> 00:38:15.033]  I think one of the reasons people get so concerned about the tweets is it's sort of a way around the press.
[00:38:15.213 --> 00:38:16.474]  He doesn't have to rely upon.
[00:38:22.265 --> 00:38:35.853]  I think I'm going to finish his thought.
[00:38:35.953 --> 00:38:42.618]  I think what he went to say was he doesn't have to rely on the mainstream news to force his agendas.
[00:38:42.678 --> 00:38:47.501]  He doesn't have to rely on the mainstream news to get his talking points across like a Hillary Clinton.
[00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:47.821]  Right.
[00:38:48.121 --> 00:38:50.123]  And here's the thing with the media, they've always done that.
[00:38:50.183 --> 00:38:53.187]  They get the message, they get to craft it in whichever way they want to.
[00:38:53.687 --> 00:38:57.672]  And instead Donald Trump just puts it out and the media is running around going, how do we counter this?
[00:38:57.712 --> 00:38:58.512]  How do we counter this?
[00:38:58.873 --> 00:39:04.319]  So now they have things like petition to ban Trump from Twitter, has gathered over 22,000 signatures.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.722]  And then they go talk about this women's epic Trump rant.
[00:39:08.243 --> 00:39:15.888]  Twitter rant going viral where he talks about the flag burning and the Saturday Night Live things and this lady has gone on, her name is Danielle Moscato.
[00:39:15.968 --> 00:39:28.276]  She is now trolling Trump which all it does is add credence to the fact that this is why he goes out and tweets because he can get his message directly out and people are allowed to directly talk to him through this medium.
[00:39:29.697 --> 00:39:31.137]  Funny enough, Dick Cheney doesn't Twitter.
[00:39:31.298 --> 00:39:32.678]  He goes, I don't even know how to tweet.
[00:39:33.798 --> 00:39:35.939]  And it's just funny.
[00:39:35.979 --> 00:39:43.741]  He is such an old fossil getting up there, but he understands media and message and how it is filtered through, especially with the liberal media.
[00:39:43.761 --> 00:39:47.342]  And that we've shown that they never gave Trump the time of day from the beginning.
[00:39:47.842 --> 00:39:49.343]  You know, they called him a joke from the beginning.
[00:39:49.983 --> 00:39:56.665]  And then when he started gaining steam, they still tried to steamroll him and try to push him to the side and pretend like he wasn't a viable candidate.
[00:39:56.705 --> 00:39:57.385]  And it backfired.
[00:39:57.665 --> 00:40:01.686]  Well, and wasn't there talk about banning Trump from certain countries?
[00:40:02.206 --> 00:40:04.567]  Now there's talk about banning Trump from Twitter.
[00:40:04.747 --> 00:40:04.927]  Right.
[00:40:04.987 --> 00:40:11.349]  How funny would that be if you had to ban the President of the United States from a social media account?
[00:40:11.389 --> 00:40:12.809]  And it's funny, here's the exact tweet.
[00:40:13.189 --> 00:40:18.651]  If the press would cover me accurately and honorably, I would have far less reason to tweet.
[00:40:19.131 --> 00:40:21.111]  Sadly, I don't know if that will ever happen.
[00:40:21.171 --> 00:40:22.412]  And this is what Trump has done.
[00:40:22.492 --> 00:40:23.192]  He's gone
[00:40:23.772 --> 00:40:28.577]  Past the prostitute buffer and gone right to the people and then of course what do the prostitutes do?
[00:40:28.898 --> 00:40:30.580]  They cry about it, Rob, and that's what we've seen.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:35.505]  They do, and I see this as being just the golden age of a mass media president.
[00:40:35.685 --> 00:40:39.169]  In the morning he can tweet about some things that he wants to talk about that day.
[00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:42.972]  And won't be forced into a corner of talking about certain things in a press conference.
[00:40:43.212 --> 00:40:45.033]  He can release videos through social media.
[00:40:45.393 --> 00:40:46.594]  They really can't stop him.
[00:40:47.034 --> 00:40:48.234]  He doesn't need them anymore.
[00:40:48.555 --> 00:40:53.857]  There's no need for a press corps at this point because he's just going to... We won't be asking questions.
[00:40:53.897 --> 00:40:57.399]  He'll be telling us what he wants to talk about or what's on his mind.
[00:40:57.779 --> 00:41:02.362]  And then people are welcome to talk about what they want to talk about in their own mass media bubbles.
[00:41:02.762 --> 00:41:08.785]  But he's gone beyond that, you know, just addressing the media or just addressing everybody what he's going to do in his first hundred days.
[00:41:09.205 --> 00:41:11.847]  Like, we've never seen presidents come out and do that on their own.
[00:41:11.927 --> 00:41:14.068]  Like, what was Obama's transition like?
[00:41:14.108 --> 00:41:21.052]  I have to go back so far, like, his transition wasn't running nearly as smoothly, and they're trying to say Trump's transition is a train wreck to media.
[00:41:21.152 --> 00:41:24.193]  And he's going around like, look, I'm getting people as I want to.
[00:41:24.514 --> 00:41:29.036]  He's, I think, listened to people, and now he's not looking at Romney or Giuliani, which I think is a good thing.
[00:41:29.536 --> 00:41:31.738]  And let's get somebody that we've never heard of.
[00:41:31.838 --> 00:41:35.880]  I like the guy he's got for Defense Secretary, SecDef now.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.381]  That's kind of, former Marine.
[00:41:38.121 --> 00:41:47.545]  Let's bring these people in who have been into the trenches, have seen the danger from a boots on the ground standpoint, not from this armchair quarterback standpoint.
[00:41:47.825 --> 00:41:50.366]  And they can't control Trump's Twitter.
[00:41:50.426 --> 00:41:52.027]  They can't control that media source.
[00:41:52.067 --> 00:41:54.208]  And that, I think, is the biggest thing that freaks them out.
[00:41:54.228 --> 00:41:55.168]  That's why they want to ban him.
[00:41:55.288 --> 00:42:01.511]  So instead of having the consumer go right to Donald Trump on Twitter, they would prefer you go to CNN.
[00:42:01.751 --> 00:42:05.973]  They would prefer you go to ABC News or something like that, where they can kind of control and paint the narrative.
[00:42:07.493 --> 00:42:11.877]  Of course, paint him, character assassinate him, that's what they try to do, and that's why he has to go on Twitter!
[00:42:12.037 --> 00:42:15.399]  That is, that is, and let me tell you this, uh, well, who's the, who's the head guy tour?
[00:42:15.419 --> 00:42:16.020]  Jack Dorsey?
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:16.580]  That's his name?
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:17.761]  Jack Dorsey, yeah, for Twitter.
[00:42:17.781 --> 00:42:18.562]  Jack, let me tell you something.
[00:42:18.582 --> 00:42:22.385]  If you ban Trump off Twitter, that will be the death knell of Twitter.
[00:42:22.685 --> 00:42:31.111]  You're never, you, you will not have a viable product after that because there are going to be so many millions of people that drop their accounts immediately in protest.
[00:42:31.171 --> 00:42:31.652]  It'll happen.
[00:42:32.032 --> 00:42:34.474]  The second you do it, people will start dropping their accounts.
[00:42:34.534 --> 00:42:35.234]  I'll drop my account.
[00:42:35.294 --> 00:42:36.515]  I've got a lot of followers, too.
[00:42:36.855 --> 00:42:38.556]  And I enjoy interacting with them and talking with them.
[00:42:38.776 --> 00:42:40.437]  But I'll go to other platforms.
[00:42:40.477 --> 00:42:43.918]  Because I'm not going to see them censor the President.
[00:42:44.278 --> 00:42:44.638]  Come on!
[00:42:44.918 --> 00:42:48.300]  It's funny, even if they did that with Obama, of course that would never happen.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.522]  But still, you would want to go find wherever it is that Obama is going to on social media.
[00:42:52.882 --> 00:42:55.063]  And it's funny that you bring that point up, because I've always said this.
[00:42:55.723 --> 00:43:10.134]  The mainstream media for some reason doesn't understand how all they're doing by trying to character assassinate Trump or censor the things that Trump is saying, or let's say they ban him on Twitter, they're just opening the gates for Donald Trump to dominate them.
[00:43:10.594 --> 00:43:14.437]  What do you think Trump is going to do if Twitter decides to ban Trump?
[00:43:14.477 --> 00:43:15.959]  You know what, you're going to have a new app, you know what it's called?
[00:43:15.979 --> 00:43:16.699]  It's called Trumpet.
[00:43:17.099 --> 00:43:18.941]  And now that's going to be the number one social media app.
[00:43:19.301 --> 00:43:21.907]  Oh, the mainstream media is not going to cover Donald Trump in a fair light.
[00:43:21.948 --> 00:43:22.208]  Guess what?
[00:43:22.228 --> 00:43:23.551]  You're going to have the Trump News Network.
[00:43:23.792 --> 00:43:25.195]  And guess where people are going to go for news?
[00:43:25.456 --> 00:43:26.117]  They're going to go there.
[00:43:26.498 --> 00:43:28.623]  So this is just, I think, something that they...
[00:43:29.904 --> 00:43:32.466]  Even though they want to censor Trump, they don't want Trump to be unfiltered.
[00:43:32.586 --> 00:43:38.311]  At the same time, I think they kind of have to let it happen because they cannot face the backlash if they try to censor him.
[00:43:38.391 --> 00:43:39.913]  They don't understand the power.
[00:43:40.133 --> 00:43:42.995]  It's like that Guardians of the Galaxy movie.
[00:43:43.015 --> 00:43:45.638]  They're all going after that one little jewel thing or whatever.
[00:43:45.678 --> 00:43:48.080]  It's like they don't understand what they're holding in their hands.
[00:43:49.881 --> 00:43:51.342]  Hey, talk about what Trump says.
[00:43:51.402 --> 00:43:52.122]  Fine, attack him.
[00:43:52.462 --> 00:43:53.862]  He doesn't really care about the attacks.
[00:43:54.203 --> 00:43:55.943]  But you got to let the man talk.
[00:43:56.503 --> 00:43:58.084]  You know, he's the president.
[00:43:58.464 --> 00:44:06.267]  You got to try to censor the president and then only go through your selective media channels where you can filter it and selectively edit him.
[00:44:06.707 --> 00:44:12.972]  And say what you want and go, oh we fact checked what Trump had to say and we're not even going to show you what he said because we fact checked him and he's wrong.
[00:44:12.992 --> 00:44:13.973]  So we're not even going to let you see it.
[00:44:14.253 --> 00:44:20.778]  And they're just having a fit right now trying to figure out how to deal with Trump and his mighty Twitter sword because they've really never seen anything like it.
[00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:27.704]  President Obama doesn't, I don't think really understood how to use Twitter effectively because... I'm not even sure if he ever tweets for himself.
[00:44:27.724 --> 00:44:32.187]  I guess when he does he supposedly puts his initials on there.
[00:44:32.448 --> 00:44:32.728]  Okay.
[00:44:33.108 --> 00:44:34.209]  D-O because he stinks.
[00:44:34.429 --> 00:44:43.593]  I never even subscribed to his Twitter channel because I knew the press was going to do his job of delivering the message.
[00:44:43.933 --> 00:44:45.734]  They were going to deliver the message they wanted to see.
[00:44:45.834 --> 00:44:46.914]  Like he relies on them to.
[00:44:46.994 --> 00:44:47.534]  Exactly.
[00:44:47.755 --> 00:44:48.455]  Same thing with Hillary.
[00:44:48.475 --> 00:44:53.257]  She relied on them to put the message out in such a way that
[00:44:53.877 --> 00:44:59.181]  You know, it was like if you tried to attack Hillary Clinton, you were this, or you were that, or you hate women.
[00:44:59.541 --> 00:45:07.768]  It's always in this, not looking at what she's saying, but if you attack what she says, or just her saying it, that's how they try to frame it.
[00:45:07.888 --> 00:45:11.631]  So it's really comical watching it happen.
[00:45:11.651 --> 00:45:16.735]  He's not even president yet, and they are so at ease, at unease with what's going on.
[00:45:16.795 --> 00:45:18.276]  So it's just, I'm loving it at this point.
[00:45:18.621 --> 00:45:21.702]  Well, and I think we're going to have this for eight years, is what I think.
[00:45:21.722 --> 00:45:26.524]  They're not going to ban him, obviously, so you're just going to have the crybabies complaining about Donald Trump on Twitter for eight years.
[00:45:26.784 --> 00:45:29.545]  Before I let you go, Rob, now this was a story that broke today.
[00:45:29.746 --> 00:45:32.207]  STL man accused of threatening to bomb workplace.
[00:45:32.247 --> 00:45:42.171]  A Missouri man has been jailed for half a million dollars cash bond after saying to his co-workers he was affiliated with ISIS and he could have the
[00:45:43.171 --> 00:45:48.973]  The car auto dealer job site that he was at blown up with one phone call.
[00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:50.713]  So a very strange thing.
[00:45:50.733 --> 00:45:56.595]  He said he had a tattoo associated with ISIS as well that he showed these people and he was arrested.
[00:45:56.795 --> 00:45:59.736]  Obviously, we'll find out whatever comes of this investigation.
[00:45:59.776 --> 00:46:03.817]  But this is on the heels the same day, Rob, where this story came from the Express.
[00:46:04.397 --> 00:46:07.658]  ISIS declares war on Trump's inauguration day, calling it Bloody Friday.
[00:46:07.998 --> 00:46:13.040]  Now, the first thing I thought about this was, is this a potential clue that there are
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:22.349]  Well, I don't believe there's any doubt that there are terror cells here in the United States, but I've never seen ISIS go, hey, we're going to bomb you next week and then do it.
[00:46:22.989 --> 00:46:28.274]  That report came out about the election, where they said, hey, we're going to cause disruptions at polling places.
[00:46:28.334 --> 00:46:28.935]  Didn't happen.
[00:46:29.255 --> 00:46:31.958]  Because ISIS doesn't really make threats, they just do things.
[00:46:32.611 --> 00:46:33.571]  You know, they threaten people.
[00:46:33.591 --> 00:46:35.692]  They say, hey, we're going to kill you if you come to our land.
[00:46:35.992 --> 00:46:37.512]  But they're cutting people's heads off.
[00:46:37.532 --> 00:46:38.252]  They're blowing up things.
[00:46:38.272 --> 00:46:40.113]  They don't telegraph when they're going to do it.
[00:46:40.413 --> 00:46:49.815]  So I think it's another bogus story using to basically probably keep people away from the inauguration, pro-Trump people, so all the anti-Trump people can come in and try to railroad it.
[00:46:50.575 --> 00:46:54.356]  Mustafa Baramek charged on Sunday with making a terrorist threat in St.
[00:46:54.396 --> 00:46:54.676]  Louis.
[00:46:54.716 --> 00:46:56.517]  For more, go to InfoWars.com.
[00:47:03.021 --> 00:47:11.162]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.143 --> 00:47:20.944]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.364 --> 00:47:25.205]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.225 --> 00:47:28.326]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.726 --> 00:47:29.806]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.

[00:48:59.626 --> 00:49:02.287]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:08.336 --> 00:49:11.840]  Well, Donald Trump hasn't even taken the White House yet.
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:22.831]  He's still the president-elect, but I'm sad to say I think we're going to be treated to four plus years of shocking off from all the reporters out there at anything that is Donald Trump.
[00:49:23.171 --> 00:49:31.520]  Now, the latest flipping out incident that happened was, of course, Donald Trump taking a phone call from Taiwan's president.
[00:49:33.323 --> 00:49:33.683]  Shock.
[00:49:33.863 --> 00:49:34.484]  Total shock.
[00:49:34.524 --> 00:49:38.726]  This was an incident that a lot of reporters don't really understand.
[00:49:38.906 --> 00:49:40.707]  And I love this article out of the Daily Caller.
[00:49:40.727 --> 00:49:41.748]  It really breaks it down.
[00:49:42.168 --> 00:49:50.513]  These are people who, just the day before this happened, had no idea what the United States phone call policy was with Taiwan.
[00:49:50.873 --> 00:49:52.334]  Joining me now is Margaret Howell.
[00:49:53.154 --> 00:49:56.056]  I mean, so much hand-wringing over whatever.
[00:49:56.536 --> 00:50:13.852]  Well, they know the implications of what it means to China, and China the next day, they take out this full-page article in the People's Daily, and they talk about, they denounce Mr. Trump for speaking on Friday with the Taiwanese president, and then they warn, quote, creating troubles for the China-U.S.
[00:50:13.892 --> 00:50:15.253]  relationship is creating troubles.
[00:50:15.834 --> 00:50:16.315]  We're good.
[00:50:35.615 --> 00:50:37.496]  It seems to matter under this current administration.
[00:50:37.576 --> 00:50:47.322]  Donald Trump has made it very clear from the get-go where he stands on the fact that China has been taking advantage of us and they're laughing at us and that's not going to be how it is with him.
[00:50:47.703 --> 00:50:52.586]  Now, of course, China lodged a formal complaint with the government.
[00:50:53.146 --> 00:50:55.968]  So they were very displeased with ours.
[00:50:56.008 --> 00:51:00.431]  They lodged a formal complaint with the government that Donald Trump will soon be in charge of.
[00:51:00.451 --> 00:51:01.212]  Right.
[00:51:01.232 --> 00:51:07.456]  So all of these articles, all the handwriting, all the tweeting, nothing ever really pointed out, you know,
[00:51:08.377 --> 00:51:09.717]  Should this policy continue?
[00:51:09.957 --> 00:51:10.818]  Is it a good policy?
[00:51:10.898 --> 00:51:12.338]  Who put this policy in place?
[00:51:12.838 --> 00:51:13.539]  Why did they do it?
[00:51:13.599 --> 00:51:20.100]  Meanwhile, President Obama is going and dancing the tango with the dictator there in Cuba, and that's great.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:23.961]  He's so loving, goes against years of U.S.
[00:51:23.981 --> 00:51:28.603]  policy of not speaking with Cuba and those relations there, but that, he's just a hero.
[00:51:28.663 --> 00:51:29.243]  He's a god.
[00:51:29.343 --> 00:51:37.212]  Well, there's a customary social practice, but there's nothing wrong with taking a phone call from a fellow leader of a country congratulating you on your presidency.
[00:51:37.233 --> 00:51:38.674]  There's no protocol broken there.
[00:51:38.935 --> 00:51:44.281]  They're just angry that he's shattering all of these ceilings, he's reaching people, and they can't stand it.
[00:51:44.301 --> 00:51:45.302]  They don't know what to do with themselves.
[00:51:45.342 --> 00:51:47.565]  He didn't violate any sort of diplomatic protocol at all.
[00:51:47.605 --> 00:51:48.246]  We're good to go.
[00:52:05.746 --> 00:52:11.167]  Was it China that didn't roll out the red carpet for President Obama's last visit?
[00:52:11.607 --> 00:52:11.967]  Pretty much.
[00:52:12.007 --> 00:52:16.488]  Didn't get the plane stairway there on the jetway.
[00:52:16.889 --> 00:52:20.109]  So, you know, kissing their butt, look where it's gotten you.
[00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:27.711]  That did not work and they're laughing and they think that President Obama is a total joke for the way that he has dealt with China.
[00:52:28.471 --> 00:52:29.692]  They feel like they own us.
[00:52:29.752 --> 00:52:30.692]  They laugh at us.
[00:52:30.792 --> 00:52:33.493]  You know, they do these really terrible trade deals, like you mentioned.
[00:52:34.073 --> 00:52:37.475]  And we're not allowed to speak about the reality that is China.
[00:52:37.575 --> 00:52:39.876]  So here is this completely oppressive regime.
[00:52:39.916 --> 00:52:49.240]  We've talked to a woman who actually escaped from China and her family, you know, was there and just totally oppressive regime.
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:56.283]  So the things that they've implemented, one of those is a total human rights atrocity, which of course is
[00:52:57.523 --> 00:52:57.863]  We're good.
[00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:20.887]  They practice industrial scale harvesting of vital organs from prisoners of conscience.
[00:53:21.407 --> 00:53:27.409]  These organs are transplanted into patients who pay exorbitant fees for a heart, kidney, or liver.
[00:53:27.489 --> 00:53:29.430]  It's made available on demand.
[00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:33.231]  Okay, so China is one of the main, you know, one of the top
[00:53:35.043 --> 00:53:38.025]  The country's there practicing this organ transplant.
[00:53:38.165 --> 00:53:41.767]  And so if you have the money to pay for it, you can go to China and you can get these organs.
[00:53:41.867 --> 00:53:43.188]  Life-saving, mind you.
[00:53:43.588 --> 00:53:45.549]  You know, of course, this is, you know, people need it.
[00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:48.551]  But where are they getting all these organs from?
[00:53:48.931 --> 00:53:49.531]  On demand.
[00:53:49.571 --> 00:53:50.912]  That's why you come here to the United States.
[00:53:50.952 --> 00:53:58.396]  It's very hard to get an organ transplant because you have to wait for someone who's an organ donor, you know, for an organ to become available.
[00:53:58.436 --> 00:53:59.837]  They have it on demand.
[00:54:00.197 --> 00:54:01.138]  Where are they getting it from?
[00:54:01.578 --> 00:54:07.621]  There's a 14 billion a year industry in China and a record 10,000 organs are transplanted in China every year.
[00:54:07.721 --> 00:54:08.742]  That's a staggering amount.
[00:54:09.022 --> 00:54:10.703]  You mentioned these prisoners of conscience.
[00:54:10.743 --> 00:54:14.025]  They're held up in hospitals, prisoner hospitals.
[00:54:14.805 --> 00:54:21.569]  The assumption is since 2006 with this documentary coming out that they're actually harvesting the organs of political dissidents.
[00:54:21.609 --> 00:54:22.550]  That's what these people are.
[00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:27.155]  Right, and so now you're speaking of two movies that actually just came out.
[00:54:27.175 --> 00:54:28.376]  They're available on iTunes.
[00:54:28.717 --> 00:54:30.238]  One is Human Harvest.
[00:54:30.318 --> 00:54:31.119]  It's a documentary.
[00:54:31.199 --> 00:54:32.901]  It won the Peabody Award.
[00:54:33.502 --> 00:54:34.583]  So this is something really great.
[00:54:34.643 --> 00:54:40.310]  And then there's also a drama coming out called The Bleeding Edge coming out on, what is that, December 18th?
[00:54:41.531 --> 00:54:48.753]  And so this one features Miss World, and she is a Chinese-Canadian actress.
[00:54:49.473 --> 00:54:51.994]  She's Miss World Canada, so she is really speaking out.
[00:54:52.014 --> 00:54:55.875]  China actually banned her from entering the country because she would dare speak out against them.
[00:54:56.015 --> 00:54:56.175]  Right.
[00:54:56.195 --> 00:55:06.397]  You know, here's this beautiful woman who's made something of herself, could be a total, you know, point of pride for this country, yet they ban her because she is really trying to draw attention.
[00:55:06.837 --> 00:55:08.418]  So these are, these
[00:55:09.218 --> 00:55:14.341]  Prisoners of conscience, they are Tibetans, Christians, practitioners of Falun Gong.
[00:55:14.741 --> 00:55:30.711]  And I know that we did a story, I believe it was last year, where the bodies exhibit, they were actually, they're having to put warning signs on the entrance of the bodies exhibit because these are bodies of Chinese citizens, potentially, or prisoners of conscience.
[00:55:30.751 --> 00:55:34.673]  And people were noticing, looking at the bodies, going, wait, where's the kidney?
[00:55:34.773 --> 00:55:35.934]  Where's its heart?
[00:55:36.034 --> 00:55:37.715]  It looks like it's missing a few organs there.
[00:55:37.875 --> 00:55:41.739]  We do a great deal of business with China because, you know, Lord knows why.
[00:55:41.819 --> 00:55:44.221]  But anyway, it hasn't been very beneficial to us.
[00:55:44.261 --> 00:55:45.342]  They bought up a lot of our debt.
[00:55:45.663 --> 00:55:47.224]  They own a lot of American industries.
[00:55:47.284 --> 00:55:49.026]  I know we're going to get into the movie industry in a moment.
[00:55:49.366 --> 00:55:50.768]  They own a lot of U.S.
[00:55:50.848 --> 00:55:51.448]  real estate.
[00:55:51.469 --> 00:55:55.272]  There's a whole birther tourism movement that happens with Chinese women entering the country.
[00:55:55.533 --> 00:55:57.795]  They understand that they can just pay, have a baby, and then go back.
[00:55:58.495 --> 00:56:11.638]  Very common practice, as well as the questionable aspects of living under communist Chinese rule and how they suppress free speech, they suppress political dissidence, they harvest organs, namely of people that don't agree with their regime.
[00:56:11.658 --> 00:56:20.561]  And not only that, Leigh-Anne, but they control, surprisingly, I don't think people out here know this and you brought this to my attention today, they control a lot of our media, what we see and hear.
[00:56:20.581 --> 00:56:20.941]  Right.
[00:56:21.201 --> 00:56:22.041]  Which is a little...
[00:56:22.301 --> 00:56:30.347]  Yeah, there's a lot of pushback for that because the Chinese are making a practice of gobbling up American companies.
[00:56:30.767 --> 00:56:35.931]  One of those in 2002, they totally took over Carmike AMC.
[00:56:35.991 --> 00:56:39.373]  It's one of the most massive movie chains in 2002.
[00:56:40.234 --> 00:56:42.255]  It's the largest theater empire, actually.
[00:56:44.917 --> 00:56:47.980]  It's kind of gives them hidden control over American mass media.
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:57:00.090]  Anything that you see in their movies, that's why they're not gonna... Even though these films coming out on iTunes are really great, well-produced movies with a really great message, very important, it's not gonna be playing at AMC.
[00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:03.113]  You're not gonna find this information because they will not allow it.
[00:57:03.213 --> 00:57:03.813]  In fact,
[00:57:04.694 --> 00:57:10.979]  They have such a huge, massive audience that Hollywood bows down to China's demands.
[00:57:11.579 --> 00:57:15.342]  They've added Chinese stars to their cast, such as in Iron Man 3.
[00:57:15.962 --> 00:57:27.110]  They led filmmakers to remove China as the origin of a zombie virus in World War Z. They swapped North Korea for China as the main antagonist in Red Dawn when they did that remake, of course.
[00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:33.575]  And then they actually removed an entire scene in Skyfall where James Bond kills a Chinese security guard.
[00:57:33.695 --> 00:57:34.035]  That's right.
[00:58:03.715 --> 00:58:04.496]  We're good to go.
[00:58:29.093 --> 00:58:29.773]  The U.S.
[00:58:29.813 --> 00:58:33.796]  being the laughing stock and being made fun of by the Chinese is over.
[00:58:33.836 --> 00:58:39.039]  And of course, go ahead and lodge your formal complaint with Donald Trump's administration.
[00:58:39.059 --> 00:58:47.785]  Now, like I mentioned earlier in the show, I'm actually going to be interviewing someone who's been working for decades to try and draw attention to this organ harvesting.
[00:58:47.825 --> 00:58:49.486]  He'll be on tomorrow's broadcast.
[00:58:49.866 --> 00:58:52.067]  But thank you all for joining us tonight.

[00:59:10.393 --> 00:59:20.121]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.442 --> 00:59:24.185]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.746 --> 00:59:27.588]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:36.017]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
