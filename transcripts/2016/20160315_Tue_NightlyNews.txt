[00:00:19.588 --> 00:00:21.432]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.492 --> 00:00:25.140]  It is Tuesday, March 15th, 2016 and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.382]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.622 --> 00:00:43.172]  Tonight, Milwaukee Sheriff David Clark says there is a stealth totalitarian movement against free speech as the radical left attempts to shut down the First Amendment.
[00:00:43.592 --> 00:00:45.734]  This is a totalitarian movement.
[00:00:46.274 --> 00:00:47.055]  It's very stealth.
[00:00:47.415 --> 00:00:53.580]  Then, Ted Cruz jumps on the Dump Trump bandwagon and he loses 300,000 Twitter followers overnight.
[00:00:57.398 --> 00:00:59.940]  And Hillary Clinton says the U.S.
[00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:03.003]  didn't lose a single person in Libya.
[00:01:03.123 --> 00:01:04.104]  Is Libya perfect?
[00:01:04.244 --> 00:01:04.645]  It isn't.
[00:01:04.705 --> 00:01:09.970]  But did they have two elections that were free and fair where they voted for moderates?
[00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.850]  Yes, they did.
[00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:16.756]  Libya was a different kind of calculation and we didn't lose a single person.
[00:01:17.116 --> 00:01:17.456]  Really?
[00:01:17.737 --> 00:01:21.881]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:06.521]  Well, some great news for Texans out there today.
[00:03:06.541 --> 00:03:07.321]  A U.S.
[00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:15.527]  District Court has decided to allow the state of Texas to join some landowners in a lawsuit against the Federal Bureau of Land Management.
[00:03:15.927 --> 00:03:18.329]  Governor Greg Abbott announced this good news, tweeting,
[00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:45.203]  And this is a lawsuit which contends that the BLM is encroaching on private land in violation of citizens' Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights, as well as infringing upon the sovereignty of local county governments.
[00:03:45.804 --> 00:03:47.624]  So I really appreciate this.
[00:03:47.704 --> 00:03:52.146]  It's our top article here on InfoWars because once again it makes me very proud to be a Texan.
[00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:56.788]  Gotta love these guys reasserting their rights as we're seeing the federal government
[00:03:56.988 --> 00:03:58.749]  We're really trying to encroach upon those rights.
[00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:06.912]  Now, of course, here in Austin, Texas, we are experiencing South by Southwest and the influx of all of these tech entrepreneurs.
[00:04:07.512 --> 00:04:14.555]  Well, one of the talks that was here at South by Southwest was given from the creator of Siri.
[00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:17.056]  He made Apple's digital assistant Siri.
[00:04:17.476 --> 00:04:24.919]  And he says, step aside, because he's actually working on a giant brain in the sky, which is going to be called Viv.
[00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:29.022]  And he says this program is going to make mental leaps to solve problems.
[00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:31.244]  It could one day outsmart us.
[00:04:31.725 --> 00:04:41.573]  And he also went on to warn, of course, we've heard these warnings before, artificially intelligent robots are going to be stealing our office jobs in just five years' time.
[00:04:42.054 --> 00:04:44.255]  And even inventors' jobs are at risk.
[00:04:44.736 --> 00:04:45.957]  This is Dag Kittloss.
[00:04:46.057 --> 00:04:47.458]  He is the creator of Siri.
[00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:49.780]  And he's working on Viv.
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.922]  He believes it's one step up from the assistance on our phone.
[00:04:53.762 --> 00:04:59.766]  And he basically is going to analyze the nouns in a sentence when a person speaks into their smartphone.
[00:04:59.806 --> 00:05:06.450]  So, whereas Siri would be able to, if you ask her a question, she might either not respond or she'll pinpoint something on the map.
[00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:11.713]  This is actually going to be able to take the words, analyze them all, and offer you up some different things.
[00:05:11.774 --> 00:05:15.296]  Of course, we've seen this plenty in sci-fi movies as well.
[00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:22.759]  But when asked by an author whether supercomputers would be replacing entrepreneurs, he said, yes, it will happen.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.380]  Just it's a matter of when.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.741]  So he says it'll all be over soon.
[00:05:26.761 --> 00:05:28.762]  Not anytime soon, though.
[00:05:28.842 --> 00:05:31.824]  So he's basically playing a part in making himself
[00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:37.909]  Redundant and making himself obsolete, which of course, we know a lot of things are going that way.
[00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.675]  Anything that humans are really enjoying that makes us what we are is kind of going the way of the robot these days.
[00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:48.938]  Also, one of the things that we're seeing a lot here at South by Southwest is automation.
[00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:51.300]  Of course, they're pushing for driverless cars.
[00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:54.643]  Lyft and Uber are really trying to make a name for themselves here.
[00:05:55.784 --> 00:05:56.685]  But check this story out.
[00:05:56.725 --> 00:06:06.052]  So about a month or so ago, we played some video of a Google driverless car having a little rendezvous with a city bus.
[00:06:06.493 --> 00:06:11.897]  Well, Google actually got a bus detecting patent a month after it hit a bus.
[00:06:12.237 --> 00:06:16.380]  So they were already preparing for this type of scenario.
[00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:20.764]  But they were actually thinking about school buses here with this patent.
[00:06:21.244 --> 00:06:24.386]  But it turns out they've got to watch out for those street buses as well.
[00:06:25.487 --> 00:06:32.553]  And another panel that's actually taking place at South by Southwest is how data can better activate voters.
[00:06:32.874 --> 00:06:35.316]  And these are people from both sides of the political spectrum.
[00:06:35.856 --> 00:06:41.161]  They were meeting at Twitter's temporary South by Southwest headquarters here in downtown Austin.
[00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:46.266]  And of course, Ted Cruz aims to beat Trump's earned media with data.
[00:06:48.067 --> 00:06:50.289]  I've got a little advice for you, Ted Cruz.
[00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:56.233]  Don't be one of the people who are blaming the Chicago rally shutdown on Donald Trump.
[00:06:56.673 --> 00:07:04.258]  Because immediately after he came out and blamed this violent mob of protesters on Donald Trump, he lost 300,000 Twitter followers overnight.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.683]  So this is what happens when you start backing violent protesters and calling it free speech.
[00:07:13.204 --> 00:07:15.205]  And these are actually mobs and people can see that.
[00:07:15.885 --> 00:07:20.848]  And Milwaukee's Sheriff David Clark actually came out with a warning against this as well.
[00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:27.832]  One of these other people who is openly speaking out about this saying, why are we calling this a form of protest now?
[00:07:27.912 --> 00:07:29.253]  Violence is not.
[00:07:29.613 --> 00:07:32.614]  These people need to look toward what Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:07:32.634 --> 00:07:34.816]  did if they want to know what real protesting is about.
[00:07:35.536 --> 00:07:39.600]  And Sheriff Clark said this on Sean Hannity's Fox News show.
[00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:43.184]  He said, Sean, everything is ass backwards in the country right now.
[00:07:43.484 --> 00:07:44.645]  We're looking at rioting.
[00:07:44.906 --> 00:07:46.187]  We're calling it protesting.
[00:07:46.467 --> 00:07:47.889]  The cops are the bad guys.
[00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:49.530]  The crooks are the victims now.
[00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:51.492]  And that's not all he had to say.
[00:07:52.213 --> 00:07:54.695]  Sean, this is a totalitarian movement.
[00:07:54.855 --> 00:07:55.375]  You know it.
[00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:55.895]  I know it.
[00:07:55.935 --> 00:07:57.016]  They have been unmasked.
[00:07:57.376 --> 00:08:00.338]  They know that to control the narrative, you have to control the language.
[00:08:00.778 --> 00:08:09.403]  They know that Trump is a threat now to their moving in and disrupting our ordered liberty here in the United States, our rule under law or the rule of law.
[00:08:10.024 --> 00:08:13.225]  And Trump and some of the other Republican candidates are a threat to that.
[00:08:13.306 --> 00:08:16.327]  This wasn't an attempt to engage in peaceful protest.
[00:08:16.387 --> 00:08:18.429]  I'm tired of couching it in those terms.
[00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:19.849]  This is not peaceful protest.
[00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:20.650]  All right?
[00:08:21.457 --> 00:08:22.497]  He is absolutely right.
[00:08:22.558 --> 00:08:24.959]  This is what they need to do in order to control the narrative.
[00:08:24.979 --> 00:08:27.360]  You've got to be able to control people's speech.
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.221]  And that's why, you know, I can support what Bernie Sanders is saying.
[00:08:31.281 --> 00:08:34.082]  I get why his supporters are out there in droves supporting him.
[00:08:34.543 --> 00:08:38.964]  But you don't want to shut down a fascist with fascist tactics.
[00:08:39.345 --> 00:08:44.427]  You're saying that you want to, you know, break down the government by giving them even more power.
[00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:45.527]  It just doesn't make sense.
[00:08:45.587 --> 00:08:49.729]  You really need to understand how you're being controlled and manipulated and
[00:08:50.289 --> 00:08:52.090]  Frankly, your tactics are not working.
[00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:58.213]  According to a new poll, left-wing protesters are actually driving people into the arms of Donald Trump.
[00:08:58.594 --> 00:09:05.077]  And of course, as we're going to be seeing another Super Tuesday here coming up later this evening, we'll have some more of those poll results coming in.
[00:09:05.397 --> 00:09:08.299]  We'll see how the people have decided to vote in Illinois.
[00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:09.700]  And that's not all.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:15.243]  The mainstream media has been claiming that the majority of GOP voters hate Trump.
[00:09:15.623 --> 00:09:17.664]  Well now, Trump has surpassed 53%.
[00:09:19.505 --> 00:09:27.489]  Which means the majority of GOP voters now at this point across the country are actually in support of Donald Trump, and that's only the people who will say it out loud.
[00:09:27.789 --> 00:09:32.091]  A lot of people don't want to say it out loud because of obvious backlash that they will face.
[00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:35.573]  Now compare that with Hillary Clinton supporters.
[00:09:36.133 --> 00:09:39.034]  Take a look at this video that our guys shot there on the road.
[00:09:39.434 --> 00:09:42.316]  I mean, they are so unenthusiastic about Hillary.
[00:09:42.336 --> 00:09:47.158]  So at least it's not a violent mob, you know, like some of Bernie Sanders' people, but take a look at this.
[00:09:50.086 --> 00:09:52.348]  I believe that she will win!
[00:09:52.388 --> 00:09:53.469]  I say Hillary, you say fire!
[00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.729]  Hillary!
[00:09:53.769 --> 00:09:53.909]  Fire!
[00:09:54.029 --> 00:09:54.289]  Hillary!
[00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.210]  Fire!
[00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:55.550]  Hillary!
[00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.711]  Fire!
[00:09:55.731 --> 00:09:57.152]  And I say Hillary, you say champion!
[00:09:57.912 --> 00:09:58.192]  Hillary!
[00:09:58.253 --> 00:09:58.813]  Champion!
[00:10:35.475 --> 00:10:38.756]  It is obvious that those people are settling for Hillary.
[00:10:39.176 --> 00:10:44.078]  That video is just kind of proof that it's the establishment who is really pushing Hillary Clinton.
[00:10:44.438 --> 00:10:46.799]  In journalism, they always say to follow the money.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.301]  And according to Federal Election Commission data, federal employees have donated over $18,000 to Clinton.
[00:10:54.402 --> 00:11:00.124]  $2,000 to Cruz, $750 to Rubio, and $0 to Donald Trump.
[00:11:00.585 --> 00:11:01.525]  And could that be?
[00:11:01.585 --> 00:11:05.246]  Because Trump has previously said it's important to audit the Fed.
[00:11:05.607 --> 00:11:12.930]  He even called out Cruz for skipping the vote on Senator Rand Paul's audit the Fed proposal back in January.
[00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.010]  You'll remember Ted Cruz, he was too busy.
[00:11:15.431 --> 00:11:18.552]  He said it wasn't going to pass anyway, even though it only needed seven votes.
[00:11:19.432 --> 00:11:27.356]  But Trump has also previously accused Fed Chair Janet Yellen of keeping interest rates low as a favor to President Obama.
[00:11:27.436 --> 00:11:30.558]  So we can see he's definitely ruffled some feathers there.
[00:11:31.098 --> 00:11:31.819]  But that's not it.
[00:11:32.139 --> 00:11:38.302]  George Soros, of course, the billionaire financier, he, of course, is alarmed by Trump.
[00:11:38.622 --> 00:11:40.003]  So he's been pouring money into the 2016 race.
[00:11:41.724 --> 00:11:48.228]  He's spent or committed more than $13 million to support Hillary Clinton and other Democrats this election cycle.
[00:11:48.569 --> 00:11:53.592]  It's already more than his total disclosed spending in the last two presidential elections combined.
[00:11:53.912 --> 00:11:55.994]  So you can see this is very important for him.
[00:11:56.514 --> 00:12:00.016]  He has contributed $7 million to Priorities USA.
[00:12:00.356 --> 00:12:02.418]  It's the main super PAC that supports Clinton.
[00:12:02.798 --> 00:12:05.060]  Another million to American Bridge.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.863]  Last week he announced he was putting $5 million into a new super PAC, which is going to be
[00:12:11.684 --> 00:12:14.685]  Uh, based on getting the immigrant vote.
[00:12:15.105 --> 00:12:24.349]  So it's part of a coordinated $15 million voter turnout effort targeting Latinos and immigrants here in Colorado, Nevada and Florida.
[00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:32.392]  So we can always, if you see a little bit of race baiting, kerfuffling going on, you can bet George Soros is not so far behind.
[00:12:32.872 --> 00:12:34.433]  But why does he do things like that?
[00:12:34.853 --> 00:12:36.674]  Well, let's ask Hillary Clinton's husband.
[00:12:40.507 --> 00:12:41.068]  Thank you!
[00:12:41.128 --> 00:12:41.688]  Thank you!
[00:12:58.291 --> 00:13:04.135]  How long have you been friends with George Burroughs?
[00:13:04.155 --> 00:13:04.596]  What?
[00:13:04.676 --> 00:13:05.056]  How long?
[00:13:05.116 --> 00:13:08.659]  How long have you been friends with George Burroughs?
[00:13:08.739 --> 00:13:09.879]  I don't know.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.803]  I've known him for, I suppose, since he was trying to help the Balkans.
[00:13:14.843 --> 00:13:17.705]  This happened, uh, two or three years ago.
[00:13:17.725 --> 00:13:20.847]  Can you be a favor and put that back?
[00:13:20.867 --> 00:13:22.088]  No, I can't.
[00:13:22.289 --> 00:13:23.750]  It's not in my style.
[00:13:27.225 --> 00:13:39.614]  But nearly half of your financial sector donations appear to come from just two wealthy financiers, George Soros and Donald Sussman, for a total of about $10 million.
[00:13:40.155 --> 00:13:40.835]  Move on!
[00:13:41.336 --> 00:13:45.479]  And Soros have given almost 90% of their funding to Hillary.
[00:13:45.819 --> 00:13:49.642]  Now, they've given about 10% to Sanders to have some control, in case he beats her.
[00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:52.904]  But they're all in, basically, 90% for her.
[00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:54.626]  So that's confirmation.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.681]  So this is a big deal, folks.
[00:13:58.641 --> 00:14:07.166]  I think everybody in the country has now heard about these violent protests in Chicago which are being blamed on supporters of Bernie Sanders.
[00:14:07.827 --> 00:14:09.328]  Alex, this is a false flag.
[00:14:09.988 --> 00:14:14.551]  These demonstrators are flying under a false banner.
[00:14:14.631 --> 00:14:17.512]  They are not Sanders supporters by and large.
[00:14:18.253 --> 00:14:22.055]  This is an operation directed by supporters of Hillary Clinton.
[00:14:22.774 --> 00:14:35.596]  Uh, paid for by, uh, George Soros and Mulan, by David Brock at Media Matters from America, also funded by Soros, and also by the reclusive billionaire, Jonathan Willis.
[00:14:37.452 --> 00:14:38.633]  We have a right to speak.
[00:14:38.793 --> 00:14:40.955]  I mean, we are law-abiding people.
[00:14:41.055 --> 00:14:43.077]  We're people that work very hard.
[00:14:43.378 --> 00:14:46.580]  We're people that have built this country and made this country great.
[00:14:47.241 --> 00:14:48.262]  And we're all together.
[00:14:48.542 --> 00:14:50.384]  And we want to get along with everybody.
[00:14:50.704 --> 00:14:56.309]  But when they have organized, professionally staged wise guys, we've got to fight back.
[00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:57.851]  We've got to fight back.
[00:15:00.378 --> 00:15:02.520]  I don't know.
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:08.884]  I've known him for, I suppose, since he was trying to help some orphans.
[00:15:08.924 --> 00:15:11.525]  This happens to everyone.
[00:15:11.665 --> 00:15:13.366]  It's all the same to me.
[00:15:13.406 --> 00:15:16.028]  Can you be a favorite?
[00:15:16.188 --> 00:15:18.269]  I'm not a favorite.
[00:15:18.669 --> 00:15:20.851]  I'm not a favorite.
[00:15:20.971 --> 00:15:22.992]  I'm not a favorite.
[00:15:23.112 --> 00:15:24.473]  I'm not a favorite.
[00:15:24.713 --> 00:15:26.334]  I'm not a favorite.
[00:15:27.085 --> 00:15:34.344]  And if that's not enough for you to get the gist of who Hillary Clinton is, she's actually doubled down on her, what difference does it make, statement.
[00:15:35.623 --> 00:15:40.947]  In a rather bizarre statement, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has said that the U.S.
[00:15:41.007 --> 00:15:49.454]  didn't lose a single person in Libya, which is to say the former Secretary of State is ignoring the murder of Ambassador Christopher Stevens.
[00:15:49.775 --> 00:15:51.876]  Now, Libya is perfect, isn't it?
[00:15:51.996 --> 00:15:52.677]  Clinton said.
[00:15:53.057 --> 00:15:57.241]  Libya was a different kind of calculation, and we didn't lose a single person.
[00:15:57.481 --> 00:16:02.365]  We didn't have a problem in supporting our European and Arab allies in working with NATO.
[00:16:02.705 --> 00:16:11.490]  Mrs. Clinton conveniently skipped over the attack of September 11, 2012, of the diplomatic special mission compound and CIA annex in Benghazi.
[00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:20.015]  The left ambassador Christopher Stevens, foreign management officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Smith and Glenn Doherty dead.
[00:16:20.216 --> 00:16:22.837]  There's even a movie out about it called 13 Hours.
[00:16:23.277 --> 00:16:28.341]  And this isn't the first time Hillary has had a selective memory, but what difference does it make?
[00:16:28.601 --> 00:16:32.183]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:16:35.609 --> 00:16:42.033]  Coming up, Joe Biggs takes to the streets of South by Southwest to find out if people really think Donald Trump is a racist.
[00:16:42.354 --> 00:16:49.439]  And then we're going to be talking about the federal government's call for doctors to stop prescribing addictive painkillers for chronic pain.
[00:16:49.459 --> 00:16:56.163]  Of course, Americans consume 80% of all prescription painkillers to absolute detriment, of course.
[00:16:56.544 --> 00:17:01.227]  And then we're also going to be giving you an update on this Super Tuesday's results.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:24.963]  The Women's Ireland says thank you so much, we're ready for Hilary.
[00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:26.003]  We need you.
[00:17:26.203 --> 00:17:27.484]  Tell your story.
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.681]  I voted last summer.
[00:17:33.701 --> 00:17:36.081]  Now it comes up to me and says, you don't know me, do you?
[00:17:36.101 --> 00:17:38.702]  So I said, I wasn't in government when you were.
[00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:45.584]  When you were, I said, first, I was the British Foreign Secretary for the United States of America.
[00:17:45.624 --> 00:17:47.984]  In 2008, I thought the whole peace process had come to an end.
[00:17:48.064 --> 00:17:49.444]  No one can speak to each other.
[00:17:49.464 --> 00:17:51.005]  I'm not trying to be violent.
[00:17:51.045 --> 00:17:52.145]  I'm calling Hillary a desperation.
[00:17:52.165 --> 00:17:55.546]  I said, Hillary, you're the only person in the world who can do this.
[00:17:56.026 --> 00:17:59.587]  I don't know what she can do.
[00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:07.688]  Nothing ever happened.
[00:18:08.229 --> 00:18:09.469]  I don't know what you did.
[00:18:09.489 --> 00:18:10.190]  I don't know.
[00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:20.837]  Because of you guys, I grew up, the first time I ever saw a gun, it was pointed to the car at my mum's window at a checkpoint in Northern Ireland.
[00:18:20.877 --> 00:18:26.140]  I've experienced it, and because of both of you, my children won't have to do that.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:31.424]  Thank you so much for everything that you've done, and I will do everything we can to get Hillary there.
[00:18:42.543 --> 00:18:43.584]  I'm running for president.
[00:18:43.964 --> 00:18:47.188]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[00:18:47.468 --> 00:18:51.592]  I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
[00:19:02.699 --> 00:19:06.121]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:19:06.482 --> 00:19:13.586]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:19:14.207 --> 00:19:22.572]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:19:22.832 --> 00:19:26.935]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:19:27.255 --> 00:19:32.619]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:33.660]  We're good to go.
[00:20:01.218 --> 00:20:15.429]  My fellow InfoWarriors, I am very excited to be able to announce to you the introduction at InfoWarsLife.com of a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsLife formulations like Survival Shield X2 and Super Metal Vitality.

[00:21:50.528 --> 00:21:55.949]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:21:55.969 --> 00:21:59.510]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:03.691]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:22:03.791 --> 00:22:07.672]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.

[00:23:05.131 --> 00:23:11.195]  Well, in the last few years, somewhere along the line, the definition of racism was changed.
[00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:20.482]  And now a lot of social justice warriors out there and anti-white people use this argument that it can't be racist if it's against a white person.
[00:23:21.002 --> 00:23:24.945]  And I lost a few friends about a year ago having an argument about
[00:23:25.225 --> 00:23:31.391]  How dangerous that idea is and now of course we're really starting to see that play out all over the country.
[00:23:31.771 --> 00:23:39.598]  Well now there's a YouTube video of a student debate highlighting some of this shocking anti-white racism at Harvard University.
[00:23:39.998 --> 00:23:43.682]  This video shows two black student activists from the University of West Georgia
[00:23:44.182 --> 00:23:50.587]  They are talking about how white people should kill themselves in order to atone for white privilege.
[00:23:50.967 --> 00:23:58.073]  Now this pair of speakers in the video, they've been described as one of the elite debate teams in the country.
[00:23:58.373 --> 00:24:05.258]  So these people are very respected and this is the debate they're saying, our argument is that we should never affirm white life.
[00:24:05.698 --> 00:24:08.381]  White life is based off of black subjugation.
[00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:12.384]  And then when a debater asks his friend, well should I just kill myself?
[00:24:13.044 --> 00:24:14.384]  They say, well, I don't see why not.
[00:24:14.564 --> 00:24:18.045]  It's ethical because you have white privilege.
[00:24:18.865 --> 00:24:23.086]  And then, of course, this is, you know, why does white privilege mean I should kill myself?
[00:24:23.146 --> 00:24:24.746]  Why shouldn't I struggle against that system?
[00:24:25.167 --> 00:24:30.288]  And then, of course, they interrupt and say, well, struggling against that system and that structure means putting your life on the line.
[00:24:30.328 --> 00:24:31.048]  So go ahead and do it.
[00:24:31.508 --> 00:24:33.728]  Now they're calling it affirmative suicide.
[00:24:34.148 --> 00:24:34.809]  It's cool.
[00:24:34.869 --> 00:24:36.429]  It's one step in the right direction.
[00:24:36.829 --> 00:24:47.575]  So this is ridiculous, and of course we have our editor at large, Paul Joseph Watson, responding to this notion of white privilege.
[00:24:49.276 --> 00:24:51.357]  I love my white male privilege.
[00:24:51.578 --> 00:25:00.283]  I love being made to feel collective white guilt for the slave trade, even though whites were the first in the world to end the slave trade.
[00:25:00.443 --> 00:25:05.966]  I love being made to feel collective white guilt for the slave trade, even though whites were the first to encourage
[00:25:06.366 --> 00:25:09.530]  Everyone else in the world to end the slave trade.
[00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:18.960]  I love being made to feel collective white guilt for the slave trade, despite the fact that the Islamic slave trade was far more brutal and lasted for much longer.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:28.470]  I love being made to feel collective white guilt for the slave trade, despite the fact that the Islamic slave trade murdered over a hundred and twelve million black
[00:25:29.311 --> 00:25:40.178]  I love being made to feel collective white guilt for the slave trade, despite the fact that more whites were abducted and enslaved by Muslims than the number of blacks enslaved by whites.
[00:25:40.378 --> 00:25:46.802]  I love being made to feel collective white guilt for the slave trade, 150 years after it was ended in the West,
[00:25:47.342 --> 00:25:52.146]  As a result of the deaths of hundreds of thousands of white males.
[00:25:52.426 --> 00:25:56.368]  I'd love being made to feel collective white guilt over the slave trade.
[00:25:56.629 --> 00:26:05.175]  Despite the fact that only 1.4% of whites owned slaves compared to 28% of free blacks who owned slaves.
[00:26:05.455 --> 00:26:09.338]  I'd love being made to feel collective white guilt for colonialism.
[00:26:09.678 --> 00:26:14.021]  As if white people were the only race to invade and conquer other countries.
[00:26:14.261 --> 00:26:18.902]  I love being told I'm a racist when I criticise the violent aspects of Islam.
[00:26:19.262 --> 00:26:24.623]  Because not all Muslims are violent, and to collectively blame all Muslims is bigoted.
[00:26:24.723 --> 00:26:32.705]  While being collectively blamed whenever a lunatic goes on a shooting spree because I happen to share the same skin colour as him.
[00:26:32.805 --> 00:26:37.086]  I just love being told I'm a racist for condemning Muslim rape gangs.
[00:26:37.386 --> 00:26:42.728]  Because not all Muslims are rapists and to collectively blame all Muslims is bigoted.
[00:26:42.768 --> 00:26:54.994]  While being lectured all day not to rape women and being collectively treated as a would-be rapist because of made-up statistics about a college rape culture that doesn't exist.
[00:26:55.294 --> 00:27:01.957]  I love how my white male privilege allows me to be judged collectively while being told I'm a racist
[00:27:02.757 --> 00:27:04.639]  For judging other people collectively.
[00:27:04.779 --> 00:27:07.961]  I just love my white male privilege, I can't get enough of it!
[00:27:08.141 --> 00:27:14.967]  I love how my male privilege entitles me to be 11 times more likely to die at the workplace than a woman.
[00:27:15.047 --> 00:27:22.493]  I love how my male privilege entitles me to contribute to 99.9% of combat deaths and casualties.
[00:27:22.633 --> 00:27:29.498]  I love how my male privilege entitles me to be 5 times more likely to commit suicide than a woman.
[00:27:29.619 --> 00:27:30.079]  I love
[00:27:30.199 --> 00:27:35.301]  I love how my male privilege gives me just a 15% chance of winning custody of my children.
[00:27:35.381 --> 00:27:41.403]  And I just love how my male privilege means I'm three times more likely to be homeless than a woman.
[00:27:41.583 --> 00:27:48.605]  I love how my male privilege means I get more than double the prison sentence than a woman for the same crime.
[00:27:48.745 --> 00:27:55.187]  Given all these fantastic benefits, now you know why I love my white male privilege.
[00:28:01.257 --> 00:28:03.438]  So you heard about what happened in Chicago this weekend, right?
[00:28:03.478 --> 00:28:10.321]  With the, basically like, small riots kind of breaking down, people getting agitated about the Trump rally.
[00:28:11.081 --> 00:28:18.725]  And they're saying it's because Trump fuels racism, and that America is racist, and Trump rallies are giving a voice
[00:28:19.571 --> 00:28:23.735]  To boost people who actually are internally racist.
[00:28:24.355 --> 00:28:29.760]  Alright, so do you think racism today is as bad as people make it seem to be on the mainstream media?
[00:28:30.961 --> 00:28:32.863]  Well, I think they might exaggerate it a bit.
[00:28:32.943 --> 00:28:39.229]  I think that people tend to get along, but when you watch the shows, you don't get that same perception.
[00:28:39.349 --> 00:28:42.312]  Yeah, I agree, it's exaggerated a little bit in the mainstream media.
[00:28:42.832 --> 00:28:44.053]  Do you really think Trump's racist?
[00:28:46.744 --> 00:28:47.085]  I don't know.
[00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:49.748]  I think if he is, he's doing it just for more propaganda.
[00:28:49.768 --> 00:28:50.729]  Ben Carson is his forerunner.
[00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:54.474]  I mean, he just endorsed him, Ben Carson.
[00:28:54.914 --> 00:28:59.860]  Ben Carson is following other people's dreams, you know, to get him to endorse him.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.341]  I don't know.
[00:29:00.521 --> 00:29:01.823]  He's racist was the question.
[00:29:02.083 --> 00:29:02.383]  I know.
[00:29:02.403 --> 00:29:04.326]  Do you believe the mainstream
[00:29:06.152 --> 00:29:06.972]  But what does that mean, though?
[00:29:07.012 --> 00:29:08.553]  Black people can be racist, anybody can be racist.
[00:29:08.573 --> 00:29:12.974]  Well, if he has them as, like, an endorser, you know, like he... No, he's not.
[00:29:13.134 --> 00:29:15.655]  He just doesn't want people breaking the law.
[00:29:15.975 --> 00:29:21.177]  I think that people just naturally are going to be suspect of people that look different, and I think that's just natural.
[00:29:21.257 --> 00:29:26.758]  And I think the media's gonna outplay that, because it sells ratings, it sells advertising across that.
[00:29:27.238 --> 00:29:31.500]  So, yeah, I think it all perpetuates itself, until we're all the same color.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.661]  He's racist, sexist, he incites violence.
[00:29:35.601 --> 00:29:37.482]  And he's tearing our country apart right now.
[00:29:37.803 --> 00:29:39.183]  Do you think Donald Trump is a racist?
[00:29:40.884 --> 00:29:49.330]  I think he makes racial comments, but I don't think that it's... I think a lot of people make racial comments, but to say that they're racist is very extreme.
[00:29:50.023 --> 00:29:58.369]  I think that Trump is deliberately trying to say things that are, I mean, like he wouldn't even denounce the KKK or David Duke.
[00:29:58.489 --> 00:29:58.749]  He did.
[00:29:59.249 --> 00:29:59.849]  Eventually.
[00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:01.270]  Eventually, later on.
[00:30:01.451 --> 00:30:03.972]  Yeah, but also... Sunday shows, he did not do that.
[00:30:04.312 --> 00:30:05.533]  Honestly, I don't think he's racist.
[00:30:05.573 --> 00:30:07.735]  I think he's telling the truth about what everybody's thinking.
[00:30:08.295 --> 00:30:09.456]  He's the only one able to say it.
[00:30:10.256 --> 00:30:10.416]  Yeah.
[00:30:12.324 --> 00:30:19.069]  You feel like the mainstream media, you know, the fact that the Republicans are scared of him, the fact that the Democrats are scared of him, do you think that's kind of cool?
[00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:22.471]  To see someone that's going to shake up Washington that much?
[00:30:22.491 --> 00:30:25.773]  They're so willing to make him look like a racist.
[00:30:26.113 --> 00:30:26.914]  He's not a racist.
[00:30:26.974 --> 00:30:30.756]  He's just... This is not your polished political... Correct.
[00:30:30.776 --> 00:30:33.218]  He's not a politician, so he just does what he wants.
[00:30:33.738 --> 00:30:34.619]  No, he's not.
[00:30:34.659 --> 00:30:35.439]  I don't think he's a racist.
[00:30:35.499 --> 00:30:37.501]  I think he's just too rich.
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:39.921]  No limitations.
[00:30:40.021 --> 00:30:40.782]  No limitations.
[00:30:40.842 --> 00:30:41.603]  I can say what I want.
[00:30:41.643 --> 00:30:42.684]  I can understand that, so yeah.
[00:30:45.506 --> 00:30:46.167]  I recognize that.
[00:30:46.507 --> 00:30:46.707]  Sorry.
[00:30:47.268 --> 00:30:49.510]  I can't get a comment out of that.
[00:30:52.464 --> 00:30:53.686]  What was that all about?
[00:30:53.786 --> 00:30:56.849]  So, is American politics pretty popular over there?
[00:30:56.869 --> 00:30:58.871]  Are a lot of people interested in what happens over here?
[00:30:58.931 --> 00:31:00.753]  It's not popular, but it's very interesting.
[00:31:00.833 --> 00:31:06.860]  I mean, it's influencing the balance in the world, and everybody's following it really closely.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:13.167]  Because, of course, America is a dominant power in the world, and we depend on America largely for a lot of things.
[00:31:13.387 --> 00:31:15.588]  I actually have a black buddy who lives in St.
[00:31:15.628 --> 00:31:16.429]  Louis, and he attended.
[00:31:16.449 --> 00:31:17.330]  He had a Trump hat on.
[00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:18.751]  He wasn't attacked or anything.
[00:31:19.271 --> 00:31:27.636]  Oh, I'm sure there's people that they're not, but it's just ridiculous to me that someone of color attends one of his events and has stuff happen.
[00:31:27.657 --> 00:31:29.238]  That doesn't happen at Ted Cruz events.
[00:31:29.298 --> 00:31:30.398]  It doesn't happen at Marco Rubio.
[00:31:30.418 --> 00:31:37.643]  Well, actually, before Ted Cruz walked out, the guy who introduced him, a preacher, openly called for killing homosexuals.
[00:31:38.244 --> 00:31:40.445]  Well, I mean, I'm not a fan of either of those two either.
[00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:42.747]  So, I mean... Ted Cruz or homosexuals?
[00:31:43.928 --> 00:31:45.532]  Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio.
[00:31:45.753 --> 00:31:52.629]  Do you think that America today in 2016 is as racist as the mainstream media tries to portray it on TV every day?
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:53.960]  No.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:54.460]  No.
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:55.321]  Absolutely not.
[00:31:55.581 --> 00:31:55.761]  No.
[00:31:56.321 --> 00:32:00.023]  Because I've seen the change from, like, how my grandparents are, how we are.
[00:32:00.603 --> 00:32:03.645]  Once the generations keep rolling, it'll be less and less and less.
[00:32:03.665 --> 00:32:09.868]  Definitely, there's still a small minority who has the same, you know, opinions, maybe, as our forefathers, but not anymore.
[00:32:09.888 --> 00:32:12.329]  Yeah, there's gonna be some racist people, regardless, all over.
[00:32:12.349 --> 00:32:13.269]  I mean, that's in every country.
[00:32:13.309 --> 00:32:17.411]  There's always gonna be a group of people that just aren't gonna be willing to change.
[00:32:17.451 --> 00:32:20.933]  But, I mean, there's also, I think, in a majority, we have more people now who are
[00:32:22.088 --> 00:32:24.089]  More opposed to racism and are more open.
[00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:25.090]  Absolutely.
[00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:26.370]  We agree.
[00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.812]  Alright, so who do you guys like in the presidential race right now?
[00:32:30.153 --> 00:32:31.253]  Bernie Sanders.
[00:32:31.713 --> 00:32:33.134]  I'm not opposed to Trump.
[00:32:33.514 --> 00:32:36.296]  I mean, I might get bombed right now, but not necessarily.
[00:32:36.536 --> 00:32:39.718]  I would like a capitalist running for president.
[00:32:39.938 --> 00:32:40.358]  What about you?
[00:32:40.798 --> 00:32:41.159]  Hillary.
[00:32:42.039 --> 00:32:42.379]  All the way.
[00:32:42.399 --> 00:32:44.801]  Because I believe in what she stands for.
[00:32:45.321 --> 00:32:45.821]  She's awesome.
[00:32:46.021 --> 00:32:46.482]  She has balls.
[00:33:02.148 --> 00:33:03.789]  The Knowledge of the Ancients.
[00:33:04.129 --> 00:33:07.672]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:33:07.932 --> 00:33:10.554]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:33:10.874 --> 00:33:14.316]  Introducing the all new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:47.821]  We're good.
[00:34:02.042 --> 00:34:08.204]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:34:08.224 --> 00:34:11.526]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:34:11.546 --> 00:34:13.286]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:34:13.326 --> 00:34:19.589]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:34:19.689 --> 00:34:25.611]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:34:25.751 --> 00:34:29.514]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:34:29.694 --> 00:34:32.637]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:34:32.777 --> 00:34:40.803]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:34:41.064 --> 00:34:43.105]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:34:43.145 --> 00:34:44.286]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:34:44.566 --> 00:34:46.248]  It's more vital than ever.
[00:34:46.408 --> 00:34:46.888]  I'm good to go.

[00:37:06.178 --> 00:37:18.844]  In an effort to stem the tide of a nationwide opioid drug addiction epidemic, federal officials are actually calling on doctors to stop prescribing so many of these chronic pain medications to patients.
[00:37:19.984 --> 00:37:21.565]  These are opioid painkillers.
[00:37:21.665 --> 00:37:24.966]  They're members of the morphine family like Oxycontin and Vicodin.
[00:37:25.347 --> 00:37:28.228]  They are prescribed to as much as 4% of the U.S.
[00:37:28.248 --> 00:37:28.908]  population.
[00:37:28.928 --> 00:37:30.289]  That's at least 250 million prescriptions.
[00:37:30.369 --> 00:37:30.689]  From 1999 to 2014,
[00:37:35.151 --> 00:37:38.974]  About 165,000 people died of overdoses.
[00:37:39.614 --> 00:37:49.161]  Now, the CDC director Thomas Frieden said, we know of no other drug prescribed so frequently that kills so many patients.
[00:37:49.601 --> 00:37:51.882]  Now, they're going to set out some new guidelines.
[00:37:52.143 --> 00:37:58.207]  Now, of course, these guidelines are not going to have the power of law, but they're saying it's going to guide insurance company recommendations
[00:37:58.687 --> 00:38:06.212]  To doctors and VA administrators for those prescriptions because, of course, as we know, they are pumping the veterans air if you go.
[00:38:06.252 --> 00:38:08.614]  They're like, well, here's 30 different kinds of prescriptions.
[00:38:09.034 --> 00:38:09.434]  See you.
[00:38:09.514 --> 00:38:10.675]  Hopefully this won't kill you.
[00:38:11.236 --> 00:38:22.283]  Now, these guidelines, of course, are not going to affect cancer patients or those in hospice care, but they're going to be for people who go in for work injuries, car crashes, other causes of long term pain.
[00:38:22.783 --> 00:38:26.306]  They say opioids should be the last option for these patients.
[00:38:26.926 --> 00:38:31.952]  And secondly, when given, doses should start out low and only increase slowly.
[00:38:32.313 --> 00:38:39.301]  And third, patients should be monitored and a plan for getting them off the drugs should start with their prescription.
[00:38:39.701 --> 00:38:42.845]  Which, oh my goodness, I worked in a doctor's office and I cannot tell you.
[00:38:43.866 --> 00:38:52.954]  In the early days of Oxycontin, how many times the reps would come in, get the doctor to prescribe this pain pill and never explain how addictive it is.
[00:38:53.254 --> 00:38:57.097]  So then these people would turn into drug seekers and then you'd toss them out on the street.
[00:38:57.437 --> 00:39:07.586]  So there was no plan for helping to wean these people off once they became addicted to this highly potent, highly effective painkiller.
[00:39:08.306 --> 00:39:21.899]  Now statistics suggest that one out of every 150 patients prescribed these long-term opioid painkillers die of a condition that's related to their prescription within three years of its start.
[00:39:22.279 --> 00:39:25.883]  So this is really awful and of course Americans
[00:39:26.323 --> 00:39:28.565]  We are the most drugged people out there.
[00:39:29.005 --> 00:39:36.071]  Americans consume 80% of all prescription painkillers, even though we're less than 5% of the world's population.
[00:39:36.672 --> 00:39:40.815]  We buy four-fifths of these highly addictive drugs.
[00:39:41.096 --> 00:39:46.540]  Now, according to the CDC, more than 28,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses in 2014 alone.
[00:39:48.522 --> 00:39:54.447]  Those deaths represented 60% of all drug overdose deaths in the United States.
[00:39:54.767 --> 00:39:58.350]  So that is more than heroin and cocaine combined.
[00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:04.015]  People are dying from prescription painkillers that they're legally obtaining from their doctor.
[00:40:04.315 --> 00:40:13.383]  So if you want to talk about the war on drugs, it's the DEA, of course, shipping in these drugs that they are then putting into your pain pills.
[00:40:14.884 --> 00:40:24.051]  We need to, you know, start there because it's actually, according to these statistics, safer for people to get the street versions of these drugs rather than getting the prescription.
[00:40:24.472 --> 00:40:36.922]  And now, in order to sort of help reduce the drug violence there in Mexico, a governor is actually floating the idea of allowing the legal cultivation of opium poppies for medicinal purposes.
[00:40:37.262 --> 00:40:43.127]  So they said this is going to help to weaken the hold that gangsters have on local farmers there.
[00:40:43.647 --> 00:40:50.752]  Now, to my knowledge, the DEA is not getting its opium poppies from Mexico, but of course we know these things are coming across the border.
[00:40:51.493 --> 00:40:57.777]  Opium poppies are used to make opium and heroin, as well as morphine and other pain-killing drugs.
[00:40:57.937 --> 00:41:05.863]  So this is where the DEA is legally shipping these in to then pass them along to these pharmaceutical manufacturers.
[00:41:06.363 --> 00:41:08.685]  So Big Pharma is the real pusher.
[00:41:09.065 --> 00:41:18.554]  And if you know anyone that's been affected personally with a drug addiction to painkillers, then you know just how devastating this can be and how destructive this is for our society.
[00:41:19.055 --> 00:41:23.339]  These are the people that should be behind bars in the war on drugs.
[00:41:23.699 --> 00:41:27.202]  Now here is a flashback from an interview that Alex Jones did.
[00:41:27.242 --> 00:41:32.908]  He was talking with medical expert David Breckler about just what Big Pharma has done to medicine.
[00:41:34.437 --> 00:41:43.503]  We're just going to look at the angle of, as an insider, the secrets of the nutraceutical vitamin system, the outside Codex Alimentarius attempted takeover.
[00:41:43.523 --> 00:41:49.988]  I want to look at it from the governments and corporations trying to shut it down and then what's happening inside of it as well.
[00:41:50.448 --> 00:41:55.112]  Yeah, you know Alex, we're lucky that we can even buy these supplements because they do want to shut it down.
[00:41:55.292 --> 00:41:59.975]  We are a major competition to Big Pharma and because we actually have better products.
[00:42:00.375 --> 00:42:03.778]  If you look at the Big Pharma, find me a great product that Big Pharma has.
[00:42:04.241 --> 00:42:04.802]  They don't have any.
[00:42:04.862 --> 00:42:05.062]  St.
[00:42:05.102 --> 00:42:09.828]  John's Wort, WebMD, 20 years ago, what, double better than Prozac and double blind studies.
[00:42:09.888 --> 00:42:10.329]  Exactly.
[00:42:10.509 --> 00:42:11.450]  Without the side effects.
[00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:13.673]  It doesn't turn you into a homicidal maniac.
[00:42:14.093 --> 00:42:14.694]  Imagine that.
[00:42:16.096 --> 00:42:18.319]  It's even safe, you know, it's safe for almost everybody.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.523]  And it's a fact that Mother Nature had something better.
[00:42:21.909 --> 00:42:22.049]  Yep.
[00:42:22.509 --> 00:42:27.812]  And you know, it's great to see this platform because health freedom and political freedom go hand in hand.
[00:42:28.332 --> 00:42:33.435]  If you don't have the political freedom to treat your own body, then you've really lost your freedom.
[00:42:33.955 --> 00:42:39.457]  And that's what's really great about this show is that you're constantly promoting both political freedom and health freedom.
[00:42:39.818 --> 00:42:40.758]  They go hand in hand.
[00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:46.721]  And to all the listeners out there, as this thing starts to wind up, the government is going to come after our supplements.
[00:42:47.001 --> 00:42:48.642]  They've done it before and they'll do it again.
[00:42:49.062 --> 00:42:52.423]  Well, they admit they've got all these attorney generals lining up with the feds to do it.
[00:42:52.903 --> 00:42:55.724]  They say, I mean, I've had folks on from Codex Alimentarius.
[00:42:56.124 --> 00:43:00.105]  Explain to folks what that is, because people go, the UN wants our supplements?
[00:43:00.185 --> 00:43:05.007]  Yes, in Europe they've already lowered the allowances of what you can even get at jacked up prices.
[00:43:05.307 --> 00:43:13.276]  Yeah, well thanks to Bill Clinton, he signed all his codex and NAFTA, which makes international guidelines to what you can supply.
[00:43:13.676 --> 00:43:18.502]  So people in Europe are going to say, you can only have 10 milligrams of vitamin C, that's the limit.
[00:43:18.922 --> 00:43:24.609]  So they're going to make it worldwide, you won't be able to get a vitamin C more than 10 milligrams, if that's what they decide in Belgium.
[00:43:25.871 --> 00:43:31.954]  And then it makes it impossible to be a mass producer and sell to a bunch of countries because everyone's different through a global treaty.
[00:43:32.134 --> 00:43:32.314]  Yep.
[00:43:32.434 --> 00:43:34.695]  And meanwhile, the whole world is buying U.S.
[00:43:34.715 --> 00:43:35.175]  supplements.
[00:43:35.575 --> 00:43:38.396]  You know, the Chinese market is expanding quickly right now.
[00:43:38.757 --> 00:43:44.479]  And consumers in China, they want American-made supplements because they're the highest quality in the world.
[00:43:44.639 --> 00:43:48.621]  Because it's kind of good that we get harassed by the FDA because it makes us the best.
[00:43:49.241 --> 00:43:49.641]  Exactly.
[00:43:49.681 --> 00:43:56.526]  Well, you know, I work with a lot of California companies, and California has the highest standards for heavy metals and for general quality control.
[00:43:56.886 --> 00:43:59.588]  So that's why when you test the products, yeah, they're squeaky clean.
[00:44:00.469 --> 00:44:03.671]  Well, we know we're a target anyway, so that's why we go super neurotic.
[00:44:04.151 --> 00:44:05.732]  Yeah, well, you're doing a great job.
[00:44:06.013 --> 00:44:10.636]  Some of the products you have, like your DNA Force, is one of the most advanced nutraceutical products in the world.
[00:44:11.917 --> 00:44:14.919]  And you guys didn't even... No, that's not even my product.
[00:44:15.646 --> 00:44:16.107]  Yeah.
[00:44:16.207 --> 00:44:17.609]  I mean, it really is expensive.
[00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:18.010]  Yeah.
[00:44:18.531 --> 00:44:25.002]  No, you guys are on the cutting edge and just supplying the information and the products to go with it.
[00:44:25.804 --> 00:44:27.326]  It's a great place to buy your supplements.
[00:44:28.072 --> 00:44:31.994]  Well, I mean, number one, I want to reap what I sow, but also we know we're targets.
[00:44:32.534 --> 00:44:35.155]  So people can be guaranteed that we're having it triple tested.
[00:44:35.395 --> 00:44:36.435]  Yep, absolutely.
[00:44:36.956 --> 00:44:40.817]  And we've got all the filing cabinets ready and everything done just right.
[00:44:41.377 --> 00:44:42.978]  You know, everything with yellow tape on it.
[00:44:42.998 --> 00:44:47.980]  We've got all the, every neurotic rule and the lawyers and the scientists, and we're trying to do a good job.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.521]  Yeah, you're doing it fantastically.
[00:44:50.001 --> 00:44:59.850]  Well, when I come back after this break with our guest, David Breckler, we're going to get into mainstream medicine's failure, all those points, difference between true and junk supplements, because look, I'm not going to name names here.
[00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:05.134]  We go out, we could put out for 20 bucks a bottle of something that costs us a dollar with the bottle.
[00:45:05.775 --> 00:45:09.518]  And we go to these other, that's why we ended up working with you guys, you guys want to put out really high quality stuff.
[00:45:10.796 --> 00:45:13.397]  We go out there and people are like, yeah, and these are other big companies.
[00:45:13.857 --> 00:45:16.537]  You want to spend $15 on what goes in the bottle or $50?
[00:45:17.378 --> 00:45:18.318]  Are you insane?
[00:45:18.338 --> 00:45:21.098]  And we're like, yeah, we actually want real stuff.
[00:45:22.359 --> 00:45:27.100]  And we're going to talk about that because versus synthetic vitamins, real vitamins.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.400]  This is so important.
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.281]  David Breckler visits us here at the info wars.com.
[00:45:31.681 --> 00:45:32.983]  Studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:45:33.343 --> 00:45:34.044]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:45:34.064 --> 00:45:34.504]  Stay with us.
[00:45:34.805 --> 00:45:38.990]  David Breckler, the vitamin man, the insider is our guest.
[00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:39.590]  All right.
[00:45:39.671 --> 00:45:43.095]  You've got the floor because during the breaks, you are really breaking it down.
[00:45:43.575 --> 00:45:45.537]  Amazing intel information.
[00:45:45.557 --> 00:45:47.239]  You were telling me the war's here.
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.461]  The next big wave.
[00:45:48.801 --> 00:45:49.581]  Thank you very much.
[00:46:05.467 --> 00:46:10.029]  Yeah, we're really lucky to be able to buy these supplements here in America, because a lot of countries, you can't buy them.
[00:46:10.429 --> 00:46:15.371]  Canada is really restricted, and many places in Europe, it's very, very restricted in what you can buy.
[00:46:15.872 --> 00:46:23.075]  So to be able to take your own responsibility, look out for your own health care, is really unique in America, and it's something that we all have to fight to keep.
[00:46:25.496 --> 00:46:28.377]  Other big news, you were just talking about Prozac during the break.
[00:46:29.076 --> 00:46:32.998]  Yeah, well, you know, InfoWars breaks the news on Prozac better than any other news organization.
[00:46:33.078 --> 00:46:39.902]  Every time there's one of these mass murders, you know it, the guy's on some form of antidepressant or SSRI drug.
[00:46:40.322 --> 00:46:50.148]  And, you know, I was telling Alex during the break that, you know, they've got the Prozac up on the screen right here, and Prozac was one of the number one antidepressants, but it doesn't work.
[00:46:50.308 --> 00:46:53.570]  It's not that clinically effective on normal depression.
[00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:56.832]  So, you get addicted to this stuff, you can't get off of it.
[00:46:57.233 --> 00:47:01.256]  And you go to the doctor, and since he can't get you off the Prozac, he puts you on Abilify.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:13.539 --> 00:49:15.540]  And welcome back to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:17.061]  Joining me now is Rob Due.
[00:49:17.121 --> 00:49:20.882]  Here we're going to give you an update on the Super Tuesday election results.
[00:49:20.902 --> 00:49:27.825]  Some people are actually calling this Titanic Tuesday because this is the kickoff to the high stakes winner take all season.
[00:49:27.845 --> 00:49:33.508]  So this is where we find out, are we on a crooked path to the rigged system or are the votes actually going to count?
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.982]  Just so everybody knows, it's all crooked and it is all rigged.
[00:49:37.362 --> 00:49:45.329]  But that does really have the establishment fuming at this point because they're calling it now for Donald Trump over a million votes in Florida.
[00:49:45.869 --> 00:49:48.392]  I mean, totally devastating victory.
[00:49:48.412 --> 00:49:50.213]  99 delegates going for Trump.
[00:49:50.753 --> 00:49:52.495]  Rubio about half as much.
[00:49:52.955 --> 00:49:56.338]  Ted Cruz, you know, just a third of that.
[00:49:56.558 --> 00:49:56.818]  Yeah.
[00:49:56.999 --> 00:49:57.739]  Totally devastating.
[00:49:57.759 --> 00:50:02.803]  So Rubio has of course made his last stand and now he has dropped out of the race.
[00:50:03.786 --> 00:50:05.987]  Congratulated Trump on the very big win.
[00:50:06.347 --> 00:50:08.128]  In fact, we have the article on Infowars.com.
[00:50:08.268 --> 00:50:11.509]  Rubio drops out after devastating loss to Trump in Florida.
[00:50:11.969 --> 00:50:16.311]  And let's go down to this tweet from Todd Harris, who is a campaign advisor for Rubio.
[00:50:16.371 --> 00:50:16.671]  He said,
[00:50:22.133 --> 00:50:23.033]  Take it to the bank!
[00:50:23.774 --> 00:50:24.714]  Take it to the bank!
[00:50:24.814 --> 00:50:30.197]  I hope people are taking him to task on Twitter for calling it.
[00:50:30.337 --> 00:50:34.019]  Todd Harris, I guess you are going to need a new job because the campaign is over.
[00:50:34.319 --> 00:50:36.500]  And now at 7.50 p.m.
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:43.163]  Central Standard Time, they're calling it for Kasich, even though there's only about 19% of the votes in for Ohio.
[00:50:43.663 --> 00:50:45.004]  Now that's not a surprise.
[00:50:45.044 --> 00:50:49.166]  They were pretty much thinking that Kasich was going to win Ohio.
[00:50:49.366 --> 00:50:50.867]  And I can see the headlines tomorrow.
[00:50:50.927 --> 00:50:54.008]  Mainstream media is going to go, looks like Kasich is building up steam.
[00:50:54.048 --> 00:50:55.349]  He's really going to take it now.
[00:50:55.669 --> 00:50:56.770]  He's got all the votes.
[00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:57.470]  This is it.
[00:50:57.730 --> 00:50:59.471]  Kasich is really going to be in charge.
[00:51:00.472 --> 00:51:02.373]  It's going to be really funny how they spin this.
[00:51:02.513 --> 00:51:06.715]  This is exactly what they did with Rubio a couple weeks ago and we see how that turned out.
[00:51:07.515 --> 00:51:10.918]  If Kasich, of course he's going to be coronated by the mainstream media.
[00:51:11.279 --> 00:51:14.021]  It's his one state, so he's the one state wonder.
[00:51:14.382 --> 00:51:19.907]  He still will need 106% of the remaining votes to win legitimately.
[00:51:20.127 --> 00:51:21.728]  So you're telling me there's a chance.
[00:51:22.469 --> 00:51:28.673]  There is a chance, because listen to this, Reuters is actually selling this idea that he's going to be this outsider.
[00:51:29.673 --> 00:51:36.637]  He says, Kasich promised the crowd he'll never be beholden to Washington insiders if he wins the White House in November.
[00:51:36.877 --> 00:51:40.939]  But that's exactly who he's going to be beholden to, because that's who's going to get him elected.
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:43.581]  Big fan of the NAFTA superhighway?
[00:51:43.641 --> 00:51:53.845]  Well, behind the scenes, they're studying arcane party rules that they believe could offer Pat the Republican nomination if he wins in Ohio tonight, which they're calling.
[00:51:54.245 --> 00:51:58.206]  So, I mean, we're seeing just all sorts of scrambling.
[00:51:58.246 --> 00:51:59.807]  Let's go ahead and see what we have here.
[00:52:02.629 --> 00:52:05.552]  1850, what did we do to win this election?
[00:52:05.592 --> 00:52:10.058]  I mean, he's one state that he's won now.
[00:52:10.278 --> 00:52:14.403]  And they're saying he could actually become the President of the United States.
[00:52:14.844 --> 00:52:15.725]  It's totally ridiculous.
[00:52:15.825 --> 00:52:21.592]  But in fact, now the GOP leadership is now going to meet with Trump, it looks like tonight at some point.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.101]  Ah, yes.
[00:52:23.381 --> 00:52:26.323]  We know that the GOP establishment has been completely against Trump.
[00:52:26.383 --> 00:52:27.284]  We've got to take him down.
[00:52:27.624 --> 00:52:28.725]  But now they see it's inevitable.
[00:52:28.745 --> 00:52:34.850]  They're going to concede, I think, at this point and bow down to him as he's really defeating them at their own game.
[00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:37.452]  And in fact, we have footage.
[00:52:37.552 --> 00:52:41.575]  They were having a pre-meeting, the GOP establishment was, right before they meet with Trump.
[00:52:41.975 --> 00:52:42.756]  And here's what happened.
[00:52:48.257 --> 00:52:48.757]  There it is.
[00:52:48.897 --> 00:52:49.698]  And that's how it works.
[00:52:49.718 --> 00:52:51.139]  Yeah, that's how it works.
[00:52:51.179 --> 00:52:52.359]  Hopefully they don't give him that offer.
[00:52:52.419 --> 00:52:54.300]  And hopefully Trump doesn't take it.
[00:53:06.559 --> 00:53:08.039]  Hopefully Trump goes on the offensive.
[00:53:08.059 --> 00:53:15.682]  That's pretty much where we're at now because we know they keep saying they're going to have this contested convention, they're making these smoke-filled backroom deals.
[00:53:18.043 --> 00:53:20.723]  I don't know, I think it's going to be pretty exciting to see what happens here.
[00:53:20.883 --> 00:53:21.323]  We'll see.
[00:53:21.424 --> 00:53:31.427]  And right now we have Richard Reeves actually on the ground at the Mar-a-Lago Club, which is where Trump is going to be giving his victory speech in Florida, where he won an overwhelming majority of the votes.
[00:53:33.067 --> 00:53:40.973]  Rubio won one little county in Miami where Spring Breakers are just letting loose at this point, having giant foam parties in celebration.
[00:53:41.714 --> 00:53:43.415]  But let's go to Richard Reeves right now.
[00:53:44.585 --> 00:53:53.571]  The establishment has been confounded and befuddled and Mr. Trump can be happy about that because I think it will work to his favor.
[00:53:54.052 --> 00:53:58.915]  The establishment has been able to figure out the best plan so far to try to stop him.
[00:53:59.455 --> 00:54:03.698]  They tried, perhaps, having Marco Rubio, having folks get behind him in Florida.
[00:54:04.159 --> 00:54:13.045]  That didn't work out when Marco Rubio self-destructed his campaign nearly three weeks ago on Thursday night at the University of Houston debate when he went outside of decorum
[00:54:13.725 --> 00:54:23.129]  And like we've talked about in previous shows and broadcasts, the establishment Republican audience and voters do not like it when candidates get out of the quorum.
[00:54:23.509 --> 00:54:25.850]  They can tolerate just about anything else.
[00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:28.631]  They can tolerate them being a little bit wrong on one issue or another.
[00:54:28.991 --> 00:54:31.653]  But they could have a candidate that's perfect on every issue.
[00:54:32.454 --> 00:54:34.795]  First Amendment, Second Amendment, Rights of Life, etc.
[00:54:35.175 --> 00:54:39.298]  But if they go outside of decorum like Marco Rubio did, they will get tanked.
[00:54:39.759 --> 00:54:44.522]  And you saw that happen with many states resulting in single digits for Marco Rubio.
[00:54:44.582 --> 00:54:46.463]  So they've failed with Marco Rubio.
[00:54:47.044 --> 00:54:51.347]  The best so far as far as the establishment being able to coalesce
[00:54:51.707 --> 00:54:55.049]  Behind a candidate is going to be behind John Kasich in Ohio.
[00:54:55.429 --> 00:54:58.491]  So we're going to find out what happens with John Kasich.
[00:54:59.032 --> 00:55:15.222]  They've tried to get establishment Republicans behind him and also John Kasich has extended his hand to the left side by talking about amnesty and granting legal status and or citizenship to the illegal aliens and having a more open border stance.
[00:55:15.622 --> 00:55:18.724]  So Kasich is using his machine to his best
[00:55:19.404 --> 00:55:33.677]  Aligned at all the different factions that he can to have him come over and vote for him in this primary So he can try to win a state so folks we are in Mar-a-Lago tonight Donald Trump is expected to be here around 9 to 10 p.m.
[00:55:34.618 --> 00:55:40.944]  So here's the situation folks I think like I said Donald Trump's going to benefit from the confusion and befuddlement of the establishment and
[00:55:41.317 --> 00:55:44.179]  But look for a Ted Cruz surprise.
[00:55:44.579 --> 00:55:50.984]  Look for Ted Cruz to come in a surprise state in Missouri or Illinois or North Carolina.
[00:55:51.304 --> 00:56:07.455]  Look for Trump to win Florida and right now in Ohio, like I said, with the establishment forces doing the best to coalesce behind John Kasich and all the different ploys in Ohio, the double voting for the ballot, the ballots got to where you have to vote twice
[00:56:08.462 --> 00:56:09.542]  So you can vote for president.
[00:56:10.002 --> 00:56:18.404]  I couldn't ever understand it even though we went to actual an Ohio voting office to try to understand what the situation was in Ohio.
[00:56:18.784 --> 00:56:20.105]  Very confusing in Ohio.
[00:56:21.445 --> 00:56:26.806]  Even a voter, a worker there at the poll could not explain the ballot.
[00:56:27.287 --> 00:56:37.229]  So anyway, we'll be uploading this so make sure to stay tuned for more InfoWars.com and the Alex Jones Show and we'll have more reports from Mar-a-Lago later.
[00:56:38.971 --> 00:56:40.911]  And that was Richard Reeves on the scene.
[00:56:40.971 --> 00:56:46.753]  I mean, he and Josh Owens over the weekend really just amassed a wide variety of videos.
[00:56:46.773 --> 00:56:49.713]  Just going into the crowds with these protesters yelling at each other.
[00:56:50.033 --> 00:56:52.154]  There's one anti-Trump protesters go berserk.
[00:56:52.414 --> 00:56:54.374]  Over 250,000 views.
[00:56:54.855 --> 00:56:57.755]  There's another one with 750,000 views.
[00:56:57.795 --> 00:57:00.416]  Black Trump supporter accosted by Black Lives Matter protesters.
[00:57:00.736 --> 00:57:03.857]  They don't like it if another black person is for Trump.
[00:57:03.997 --> 00:57:05.057]  The Black Lives Matter people.
[00:57:05.237 --> 00:57:05.537]  Oh yeah.
[00:57:05.757 --> 00:57:19.149]  And I don't think they speak for the majority of Americans, that is definitely a very large vocal minority, but, and they've even got, they've captured all kinds of people in their movement that if you say anything outside what they say, then you're automatically racist.
[00:57:19.409 --> 00:57:21.451]  Look, hey, let me just say something, Black Lives Matter people.
[00:57:22.432 --> 00:57:25.175]  Black people sold you into slavery in Africa.
[00:57:26.189 --> 00:57:30.392]  You know, that's how, if you want to take it all the way back to the beginning, that's how it happened.
[00:57:30.812 --> 00:57:33.414]  So, please, send me some hate tweets if you want.
[00:57:33.614 --> 00:57:36.896]  But let's go and look at what's going on in North Carolina right now.
[00:57:36.916 --> 00:57:43.060]  So yeah, it's 757 now, Central Standard Time, and in North Carolina, very close between Trump and Cruz.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:44.021]  34% in.
[00:57:44.201 --> 00:57:48.464]  Yeah, 39, it's about almost 40% for Trump at this moment.
[00:57:49.325 --> 00:57:53.928]  In Illinois, they've only got about 3% of the votes coming in, but they're saying, you know,
[00:57:54.568 --> 00:57:56.791]  These can all go either way at this point.
[00:57:56.811 --> 00:57:57.653]  Nothing is certain.
[00:57:58.053 --> 00:58:08.048]  So we will not be going live long tonight so you'll have to either stay tuned to your own TV set or of course I'm sure Alex Jones will be there with the update tomorrow on the Alex Jones Show at 11 a.m.
[00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:11.010]  And I just want to give a quick update.
[00:58:11.050 --> 00:58:14.112]  People were going after Trump saying people were doing the how Hitler.
[00:58:15.392 --> 00:58:15.752]  Look at this.
[00:58:15.792 --> 00:58:16.713]  I tweeted this out today.
[00:58:16.933 --> 00:58:17.293]  Right here.
[00:58:18.033 --> 00:58:20.074]  Here's Bernie Sanders raising his hand.
[00:58:20.314 --> 00:58:25.216]  Oh, that obviously means he's he's signaling Hitler at this point.
[00:58:25.256 --> 00:58:25.936]  What's he doing?
[00:58:25.956 --> 00:58:27.197]  There he is right there.
[00:58:27.557 --> 00:58:28.157]  Oh, man.
[00:58:28.177 --> 00:58:28.597]  Look at that.
[00:58:28.657 --> 00:58:30.958]  Bernie Sanders is worth a thousand words.
[00:58:31.158 --> 00:58:32.179]  And look, here's Hillary.
[00:58:32.519 --> 00:58:34.240]  This was from Ben Garrison.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.060]  Heil Hillary.
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:36.962]  I mean, everybody's doing it.
[00:58:37.222 --> 00:58:38.382]  Everybody raises their hand.
[00:58:38.402 --> 00:58:40.203]  That doesn't mean they're for Hitler.
[00:58:40.644 --> 00:58:42.625]  So don't believe the hype from the mainstream media.
[00:58:42.645 --> 00:58:45.747]  They're going to be talking about this tomorrow, how Kasich had a big upset.
[00:58:46.307 --> 00:58:47.468]  And, oh, we've got to watch out.
[00:58:47.488 --> 00:58:50.950]  This is the surge we've been hoping for from an outside candidate.
[00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:54.152]  You only have to have impossible odds to become the president.
[00:58:54.192 --> 00:58:55.453]  Like, just ask John Kasich.
