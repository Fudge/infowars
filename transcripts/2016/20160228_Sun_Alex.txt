[00:00:06.852 --> 00:00:21.961]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:28.485]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:31.507]  They say there's no rest for the wicked.
[00:00:31.507 --> 00:00:32.828]  What about rest for the patriots?
[00:00:32.828 --> 00:00:34.769]  I have been working seven days a week
[00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:39.258]  The last few weeks because there's just so much news, so much developing.
[00:00:39.258 --> 00:00:42.222]  Our story was the top story over the weekend at Drudge.
[00:00:42.222 --> 00:00:46.108]  Cruz told Rubio that he will drop out.
[00:00:48.388 --> 00:00:51.849]  If he's given the Supreme Court appointment, that's directly from high-level sources.
[00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:58.491]  We're going to be breaking down the story that was top on Drudge, his insider leaks Koch brothers' Rubio plan to stop Trump.
[00:00:58.491 --> 00:00:59.692]  It's all coming up after the break.
[00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:00.552]  It's huge.
[00:01:00.552 --> 00:01:02.073]  It could change the course of the election.
[00:01:02.073 --> 00:01:05.814]  But first, a John Bowne report on the globalist trying to break America's will.
[00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:08.615]  The new world order crime syndicate.
[00:01:08.615 --> 00:01:09.655]  Oh, pardon me.
[00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:13.696]  World leaders are pulling out the stops to lecture the American people.
[00:01:13.696 --> 00:01:19.598]  The Pope is demanding Americans allow an invasion of diseased crime and terror into our country.
[00:01:19.598 --> 00:01:27.300]  Meanwhile, Sweden and Norway are on the verge of collapse due to the full-scale migrant invasion of Europe.
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:34.022]  And then, a person who only thinks about making muri,
[00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:52.333]  And our largest debt holder, China, who owns 8% or $1.2 trillion in publicly held U.S.
[00:01:52.333 --> 00:02:00.016]  debt, has warned the United States not to adopt punitive currency policies that could disrupt U.S.-China relations.
[00:02:00.296 --> 00:02:14.559]  Money Morning reports the Red Dragon's cautionary advice came after GOP favorite Donald Trump won Nevada's caucus with a landslide 45.9% of the vote and 14 of its 30 delegates.
[00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:23.942]  In a statement made overnight, China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters in Beijing that we are following with interest the U.S.
[00:02:23.942 --> 00:02:25.582]  presidential election.
[00:02:25.582 --> 00:02:29.783]  And now former Mexican President Vicente Fox is lecturing America.
[00:02:30.023 --> 00:02:32.465]  He knows Mexico needs the U.S.
[00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:34.607]  when it comes to trade, just the way the U.S.
[00:02:34.607 --> 00:02:35.728]  needs Mexico.
[00:02:35.728 --> 00:02:36.588]  I have to say it.
[00:02:36.588 --> 00:02:40.591]  We're not, I am not going to pay for that wall.
[00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:41.772]  I am not.
[00:02:41.772 --> 00:02:53.281]  So if you don't get an actual check from the Mexican government for 8 or 10 or 12 billion dollars, whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?
[00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:56.564]  I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller.
[00:02:56.564 --> 00:02:56.964]  Believe me.
[00:02:57.865 --> 00:03:03.347]  This is the same New World Order criminal that pushed to merge the United States with Mexico.
[00:03:03.347 --> 00:03:05.928]  Kit Daniels writes, Fox wanted the U.S.
[00:03:05.928 --> 00:03:18.912]  to join Mexico and Canada into an EU-style North American Union, which would combine all three countries into one regional government using one currency, like the euro, at the expense of both U.S.
[00:03:18.912 --> 00:03:21.753]  national sovereignty and individual rights.
[00:03:22.273 --> 00:03:35.909]  Vicente wrote in his autobiography, Revolution of Hope, I proposed a NAFTA plus plan to President Bush and Canada's Prime Minister to move us toward a single continental economic union modeled on the European example.
[00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:41.096]  At summits, I took every opportunity to advocate clearly for free market policies.
[00:03:41.636 --> 00:03:50.520]  Showing what sound economics could do to fund social justice, arguing for globalism and the free trade area of the Americas.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:57.803]  In concert with Vicente Fox, the CFR proposed increased labor mobility between the US and Mexico.
[00:03:58.143 --> 00:04:11.832]  Which would effectively grant amnesty to illegal immigrants and a North American regulatory plan with a unified approach to all three countries, which would effectively end U.S.
[00:04:11.832 --> 00:04:13.293]  national sovereignty.
[00:04:13.293 --> 00:04:23.099]  Meanwhile, our government continues to persecute from within, as the Republican presidential candidates express their dismay with being audited by the IRS.
[00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:28.783]  We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong.
[00:04:28.783 --> 00:04:33.507]  You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast.
[00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:36.149]  I'm always audited by the IRS.
[00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:52.482]  And as the New World Order mouthpieces, uh, excuse me, and as the world leaders lash out against a populist blowback to their domination of planet Earth, how long before they push yet another button to get their agenda moving in the right direction?
[00:04:52.482 --> 00:04:53.083]  John Bowne.
[00:04:53.244 --> 00:04:54.137]  Furn4Wars.com
[00:04:58.365 --> 00:05:01.866]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:10.129]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:15.530]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:13.385]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:06:13.385 --> 00:06:26.315]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:26.315 --> 00:06:30.077]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very important transmission.
[00:06:30.077 --> 00:06:32.059]  They're all important, but this one particularly.
[00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:32.819]  The 28th day
[00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.752]  Of February 2016, I am your host.
[00:06:40.752 --> 00:06:45.214]  And here we are with Leap Year upon us.
[00:06:45.214 --> 00:06:54.678]  Roger Stone, the consummate Trump insider, his good friend of 40 plus years, his former campaign head, who Trump tweeted about Saturday.
[00:06:54.678 --> 00:07:01.601]  In fact, we can pull up Trump's tweet on him in a moment, where he said, Roger Stone's been banned from CNN.
[00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:07.573]  He is a patriot.
[00:07:07.573 --> 00:07:08.873]  He is basically a friend.
[00:07:08.873 --> 00:07:09.333]  He is tough.
[00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:10.574]  He is loyal.
[00:07:10.574 --> 00:07:14.116]  That just gives you an example of what Donald Trump thinks about Mr. Stone.
[00:07:14.116 --> 00:07:25.022]  And he left the campaign six months ago so that he could basically do things the way he specifically wanted to, but be separate from the rest of the Trump camp, who he gets along with fine.
[00:07:25.022 --> 00:07:27.943]  And I've known him for about 10 years as a top JFK researcher.
[00:07:27.943 --> 00:07:29.584]  I knew he'd been a top Politico before that.
[00:07:32.947 --> 00:07:37.990]  But he is an influence on Trump, giving him research material and information.
[00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:51.657]  And you see Trump coming out about the 28 pages of 9-11, and Trump coming out about political correctness and censorship, and Trump coming out and saying he'll indict Hillary if he's elected, and Trump coming out and saying China can't have one-sided trade deals.
[00:07:51.657 --> 00:07:57.880]  Those are his own research and experiences, but it's also a lot of the research that Stone's working on.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.182]  And Stone was obviously in studio for two hours on Friday with us.
[00:08:03.945 --> 00:08:15.710]  And then, of course, we went out to dinner Friday, and he kept getting up and going outside to take phone calls.
[00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.531]  And he would come back, you know, knowing that I'm in the media, so he can tell me things without me repeating it.
[00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:22.593]  He told me a lot of amazing things.
[00:08:22.593 --> 00:08:27.595]  And so much of what he's told me in the past ends up happening a few weeks later.
[00:08:27.595 --> 00:08:30.976]  Like he said, look for Trump to come out against the Federal Reserve and call for it to be audited.
[00:08:30.976 --> 00:08:32.196]  Happened the next Monday.
[00:08:32.196 --> 00:08:33.477]  He was on that Friday two weeks ago.
[00:08:34.534 --> 00:08:36.235]  Look for him to call for indicting Hillary.
[00:08:36.235 --> 00:08:38.876]  It happened.
[00:08:38.876 --> 00:08:41.157]  It's amazing.
[00:08:41.157 --> 00:08:46.000]  I learned why Trump exposes vaccines, but I'm not allowed to tell you.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.641]  The folks can probably figure it out for themselves.
[00:08:48.641 --> 00:08:54.304]  How many people have had bad experiences with them?
[00:08:54.304 --> 00:08:58.386]  But so much of what he told me, I can't repeat.
[00:08:58.386 --> 00:08:59.727]  Like, look for Senator
[00:09:00.945 --> 00:09:03.587]  Sessions to endorse Trump.
[00:09:03.587 --> 00:09:05.668]  That's now the top story on DrugsReport.com.
[00:09:05.668 --> 00:09:09.130]  Now I can say it because it's already happened to come out.
[00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:13.772]  The vaunted siren is up there right now and Trump is live in Alabama.
[00:09:13.772 --> 00:09:14.613]  Get ready for that to happen.
[00:09:14.613 --> 00:09:19.956]  Chris Christie just obviously endorsed him on Friday.
[00:09:19.956 --> 00:09:25.199]  Now what was on DrugsReport.com since yesterday but just got rolled off?
[00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:27.961]  It was this headline.
[00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:29.842]  Then I'll get to the new news that's even bigger.
[00:09:30.936 --> 00:09:36.379]  Bombshell insider leaks Koch brothers Rubio plan to stop Trump.
[00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:55.530]  Now it was in Politico on Friday that 200 top Republican millionaires and billionaires met in New York with Rubio and obviously Roger Stone is from New York and Connecticut and a big political insider and he had the sources and
[00:09:56.519 --> 00:10:00.862]  He said, boy, I tell you, it's scary news, but we can still defeat it, because the Koch brothers don't know what they're doing.
[00:10:00.862 --> 00:10:03.844]  They just spend money everywhere and don't target it.
[00:10:03.844 --> 00:10:06.846]  $75 million that they and others gave, in fact, the number's bigger than that.
[00:10:06.846 --> 00:10:13.611]  They said, let's just say $75 million, and they're going to get fully behind Rubio, and basically Cruz is done.
[00:10:13.611 --> 00:10:15.652]  They're not giving him anything.
[00:10:15.652 --> 00:10:20.675]  Which is almost a positive for Cruz that the Koch brothers don't want him either.
[00:10:20.675 --> 00:10:21.396]  The Texas Senator.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.461]  And then of course, since this came out yesterday, it's actually come out in the news, and indeed that happened.
[00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:33.563]  So, Stone is continuing to give us very, very accurate information.
[00:10:33.563 --> 00:10:45.027]  Now, after dinner we went out, as if two hours of the radio wasn't enough that day, and I said, let's do a Facebook mentions on the streets of downtown Austin after we ate at Lambert's BBQ.
[00:10:45.027 --> 00:10:46.808]  I don't know any stock in it, but man is it gourmet.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.882]  And we come outside and I say, it was really nice lighting those pools of light over there by that shop.
[00:10:52.882 --> 00:10:55.683]  Let's do a 10-minute Facebook mentions.
[00:10:55.683 --> 00:11:00.444]  Can you talk about any of the things that you just basically discussed in there?
[00:11:00.444 --> 00:11:12.249]  And he said, yeah, I'll talk about the fact that the Koch brothers are doing all this and the fact you're trying to buy the election and that shows the establishment truly is against Trump.
[00:11:12.249 --> 00:11:17.231]  But he said, I'm not ready to talk about what I told you about the Supreme Court.
[00:11:17.231 --> 00:11:17.871]  And I said, okay.
[00:11:19.437 --> 00:11:22.159]  And then I talked to him on the phone.
[00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:35.470]  Well, I introduced him in a speech he gave last night, but I talked to him on the phone before he took off this morning, and he should be back in New York soon, so he may be able to pop in today, tonight, if not tomorrow.
[00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.153]  And he said, you know what?
[00:11:38.153 --> 00:11:46.259]  It's gonna come out about the Supreme Court situation, at least part of it, so you can talk about this part of it, but don't talk about the other two-thirds I told you.
[00:11:47.031 --> 00:11:49.312]  And then I may be able to break it on your show tomorrow.
[00:11:49.312 --> 00:11:50.553]  So we're waiting.
[00:11:50.553 --> 00:11:52.334]  But here is the big news.
[00:11:52.334 --> 00:11:54.515]  I shot a Facebook mentions right before I went on air today.
[00:11:54.515 --> 00:11:55.916]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:11:55.916 --> 00:11:59.397]  We have an HD version we shot that's being uploaded right now.
[00:11:59.397 --> 00:12:01.618]  That'll be added to this story.
[00:12:01.618 --> 00:12:06.761]  And that we will put up on Infowars.com and on our YouTube and Facebook and everywhere else.
[00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:08.622]  It needs to go mega viral.
[00:12:08.622 --> 00:12:12.264]  But it's a big deal to have the Koch brothers trying to buy this election.
[00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:14.245]  And basically saying they're not going to be for Cruz or Trump.
[00:12:19.127 --> 00:12:19.327]  I don't
[00:12:37.705 --> 00:12:40.746]  Talk directly to not one, not two, but three top people.
[00:12:40.746 --> 00:12:42.247]  It's all very incestuous.
[00:12:42.247 --> 00:12:45.628]  I mean, it's all a club, even though they're fighting with each other.
[00:12:45.628 --> 00:12:46.448]  It's political operatives.
[00:12:46.448 --> 00:12:48.769]  They all know each other for decades.
[00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:57.672]  And Cruz had his top lawyer call up Rubio Friday during the day.
[00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:04.966]  And said, if you will give me the Supreme Court nomination, I will throw all my support behind you.
[00:13:04.966 --> 00:13:07.388]  Now, this is according to Roger Stone.
[00:13:07.388 --> 00:13:08.869]  And I think he's a good source.
[00:13:08.869 --> 00:13:10.250]  I think he's truthful.
[00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.131]  But I'm not saying that.
[00:13:11.131 --> 00:13:16.255]  That's a report from Roger Stone, not from Alex Jones.
[00:13:16.255 --> 00:13:16.815]  I want to be clear.
[00:13:16.815 --> 00:13:19.918]  I'm reporting what he authorized me to tell you.
[00:13:19.918 --> 00:13:22.120]  And that is so big on so many fronts.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.521]  That sounds like Illinois politics.
[00:13:23.521 --> 00:13:26.043]  I mean, I don't even know if that's legal.
[00:13:28.598 --> 00:13:34.143]  To say, I think it's once you're in office you can't do that.
[00:13:34.143 --> 00:13:39.127]  I think in a campaign, from what I was trying to read today, I've got a pretty good political savvy, I think it is legal.
[00:13:39.127 --> 00:13:42.810]  But it's very unethical in my view, if true.
[00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:53.439]  So, I believe Stone, so either Cruz's people are putting this out for whatever reason, there's a lot of subterfuge that goes on, a lot of dirty tricks internally, a lot of sabotage, who knows?
[00:13:53.439 --> 00:13:54.040]  We gotta look at that.
[00:13:56.215 --> 00:13:57.216]  Or it's true.
[00:13:57.216 --> 00:14:04.159]  And the way this lawyer has operated, the way he was George Herbert Walker Bush's, you know, one of his top guys, his wife Goldman Sachs, all of it.
[00:14:04.159 --> 00:14:05.940]  He knows the Koch brothers are lined up against him.
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.281]  He's sliding fast in the polls.
[00:14:07.281 --> 00:14:11.403]  It would be a good position for him to position himself in.
[00:14:11.403 --> 00:14:15.185]  And so he needs to answer the question the press needs to ask Ted Cruz.
[00:14:15.185 --> 00:14:17.187]  Is this true what Roger Stone says?
[00:14:17.187 --> 00:14:20.008]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:14:20.008 --> 00:14:23.010]  And so that's the $64 trillion question right now.
[00:14:24.653 --> 00:14:25.573]  But it's a big deal.
[00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:32.315]  I mean, how would that affect Texas voters and other Super Tuesday voters coming up next week in just two, three days?
[00:14:32.315 --> 00:14:39.736]  As it comes out that reportedly Ted Cruz is shopping this around to Marco Rubio.
[00:14:39.736 --> 00:14:45.917]  I think it's fair to say, I bet he shopped at some other places, but who knows, maybe that'll come out.
[00:14:45.917 --> 00:14:47.658]  Maybe other little birds were saying that, but...
[00:14:50.734 --> 00:14:59.524]  Well, I tell you, I wish I could tell you all the stuff I was told, because the third time, the fifth time, the tenth time, something Stone tells me comes completely true.
[00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:02.307]  The fifteenth or twentieth time, you really start listening to him.
[00:15:02.307 --> 00:15:03.248]  And his name's on this.
[00:15:03.248 --> 00:15:06.132]  I mean, he wouldn't be putting this out for no reason.
[00:15:06.132 --> 00:15:08.675]  It's a big deal, regardless.
[00:15:08.675 --> 00:15:10.817]  And the story, the video is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.822]  I shot a special report on this that hasn't even uploaded to YouTube yet.
[00:15:15.822 --> 00:15:17.863]  It's being uploaded right now, but we already have it.
[00:15:17.863 --> 00:15:19.244]  It's now uploaded into our systems.
[00:15:19.244 --> 00:15:21.465]  I just shot it before I went live, so it's focused.
[00:15:21.465 --> 00:15:24.167]  I'm going to come back and play this report.
[00:15:24.167 --> 00:15:25.428]  It's about five minutes long, right, CJ?
[00:15:27.432 --> 00:15:31.535]  Okay, and it's got some clips of the previous interview Friday with Stone that have gone viral.
[00:15:31.535 --> 00:15:36.398]  We'll come back, play that, out of the break, and I'm going to get into all the other big news.
[00:15:36.398 --> 00:15:46.004]  Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Trump, Senator Sessions set to endorse him ahead of Super Tuesday, according to DrudgeReport.com.
[00:15:46.004 --> 00:15:48.526]  I was seeing that on InfoWars in comments today.
[00:15:48.526 --> 00:15:56.051]  I think it's an obvious choice when he's there to speak with Sessions, but Drudge has the intel that it's imminent, with the siren going wild.
[00:15:57.074 --> 00:16:00.277]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[00:17:57.691 --> 00:17:58.511]  Hey, everyone!
[00:17:58.511 --> 00:18:04.652]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:18:04.652 --> 00:18:06.713]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:18:06.713 --> 00:18:16.995]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:22.976]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.

[00:19:06.805 --> 00:19:08.145]  Talk about the effects.
[00:19:08.145 --> 00:19:09.646]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:19:09.646 --> 00:19:11.566]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:19:11.566 --> 00:19:12.686]  I feel like I look better.

[00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.271]  Well, so does he.
[00:20:20.271 --> 00:20:23.034]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:23.034 --> 00:20:28.100]  Alright, I'm on the phone with Roger Stone right now.
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.122]  He's probably gonna be popping in.
[00:20:30.122 --> 00:20:31.924]  He's on 5th Avenue in a taxi.
[00:20:33.311 --> 00:20:37.397]  I want you to hear him, since I've been green-lined to talk about this, just hear it from him directly.
[00:20:37.397 --> 00:20:45.568]  I'm going to air this piece that we're premiering right now that I shot, breaking why this is so big down, and then we'll see if he's going to be on right after that probably.
[00:20:45.568 --> 00:20:46.970]  I've got to give him the hotline numbers.
[00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:48.372]  Let's go ahead and go to this report.
[00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:50.215]  You're watching and listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:21:03.098 --> 00:21:10.121]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with some of the most important political news of the 2016 race.
[00:21:10.121 --> 00:21:13.463]  This is over-the-top info.
[00:21:13.463 --> 00:21:26.849]  We'll put it on screen for viewers, but Drudge in the last 24 hours has been top-linked to our exclusive interview with the consummate Trump insider, Roger Stone, a veteran inside four administrations, but he's worked for nine presidents.
[00:21:26.849 --> 00:21:29.650]  They've been involved in nine major campaigns.
[00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:30.351]  He is the former
[00:21:31.806 --> 00:21:34.989]  Campaign chairman for Trump and one of his top advisors.
[00:21:34.989 --> 00:21:36.851]  Stone has been in Austin for the last two and a half days.
[00:21:36.851 --> 00:21:39.653]  He left back to New York this morning.
[00:21:39.653 --> 00:21:50.083]  Now, he broke the news on Friday of what happened inside that secret meeting Thursday night in New York with 200 top Republican donors that Politico reported on.
[00:21:50.083 --> 00:21:58.010]  That $75 million was given by the Koch brothers, who buy the Republicans and Democrats, to try to stop Trump and back Marco Rubio.
[00:21:59.755 --> 00:22:05.698]  Now that's huge news, and it's all over the press right now, but here's what's even bigger.
[00:22:05.698 --> 00:22:13.001]  He was not ready at that time, but talking to him yesterday, he said, no, I'm ready now for you to talk about the next piece.
[00:22:13.001 --> 00:22:16.423]  And he's going to be on the show in the next 24 hours to break it down in detail.
[00:22:18.157 --> 00:22:23.401]  And I have Richard Reeves coming on the show today, who was there at the meeting to break all this down as well, our political correspondent.
[00:22:23.401 --> 00:22:27.224]  We've been authorized to talk about some of it, not all of it, because it's so dangerous.
[00:22:27.224 --> 00:22:29.046]  Now get ready for this.
[00:22:29.046 --> 00:22:46.440]  According to Roger Stone, who directly talked to the top people in three other campaigns, his campaign and the other two, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, Ted Cruz had a lawyer, high-powered lawyer,
[00:22:48.632 --> 00:23:02.322]  Call up Marco Rubio and say Ted Cruz is ready to drop out if you promise to nominate him for the Supreme Court of the United States.
[00:23:02.322 --> 00:23:17.072]  And let's just say this, some other phone calls are being made as well around the same lines and people don't trust Cruz one bit and Marco Rubio told him absolutely no, reportedly.
[00:23:18.228 --> 00:23:23.434]  And he's already talked about the wives calling each other and asking people to drop out and the rest of it.
[00:23:23.434 --> 00:23:33.504]  But this is unprecedented because Cruz knows the entire Republican leadership, the Koch brothers, Fox News, has lost half their viewers the last few months attacking Trump.
[00:23:33.504 --> 00:23:35.226]  There are stories on that breaking it down.
[00:23:36.267 --> 00:23:36.447]  Are you?
[00:23:51.391 --> 00:23:59.633]  There's a lot of legalese involved here, but this is unprecedented information, and it's coming from somebody that's never steered us wrong.
[00:23:59.633 --> 00:24:00.934]  It's huge.
[00:24:00.934 --> 00:24:05.155]  So, regardless, we need to see this in the news.
[00:24:05.155 --> 00:24:13.878]  And Stone, obviously, is going to be out there in the press talking about the fact that from high-level sources inside the campaigns, this happened.
[00:24:13.878 --> 00:24:16.178]  And there's a lot more to this.
[00:24:16.178 --> 00:24:17.079]  There's a lot more to this.
[00:24:17.079 --> 00:24:17.859]  I mean, do you think?
[00:24:19.175 --> 00:24:21.837]  That if he was going to make that call to somebody, Ted Cruz was?
[00:24:21.837 --> 00:24:25.139]  Do you think that'd only be to that person?
[00:24:25.139 --> 00:24:27.380]  This is big.
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:35.966]  And if it comes out that the Koch brothers, who are universally reviled, is trying to destroy Trump.
[00:24:35.966 --> 00:24:41.830]  And if it comes out that Cruz knows that the establishment won't put up with him, but wants a Supreme Court seat.
[00:24:43.049 --> 00:24:49.452]  And it's basically trying to drop out to catapult Rubio, perhaps into the lead, for that seat.
[00:24:49.452 --> 00:24:50.813]  It needs to be investigated.
[00:24:50.813 --> 00:24:55.755]  And if people inside the Cruz campaign are telling Roger Stone stuff, is it true?
[00:24:55.755 --> 00:25:01.298]  Ted Cruz, who I think has done a lot of great things for the Second Amendment, you name it, needs to come out and say this is incorrect.
[00:25:01.298 --> 00:25:05.580]  And we're ready, we've had Ted Cruz on before, to have him come on or his campaign and address this.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.463]  But InfoWars is the new independent media.
[00:25:09.463 --> 00:25:10.744]  We are leading the charge.
[00:25:10.744 --> 00:25:13.006]  Tens of millions of viewers and listeners a day.
[00:25:13.006 --> 00:25:15.528]  And the establishment media is not going to be able to ignore this.
[00:25:15.528 --> 00:25:20.292]  Donald Trump is a focal point of the grassroots awakening that's taking place and happening.
[00:25:20.292 --> 00:25:21.352]  And so are we.
[00:25:21.352 --> 00:25:23.374]  And the more we're ignored, the more we're attacked.
[00:25:23.374 --> 00:25:27.758]  They're trying to not even let us into the RNC and DNC coming up, like refusing us press passes right now.
[00:25:28.278 --> 00:25:31.079]  I was at the RNC and DNC 10, 12, 14 years ago.
[00:25:31.079 --> 00:25:32.280]  I've been at all of them.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:36.061]  Just now that we're so successful and reach millions of people every day.
[00:25:36.061 --> 00:25:38.362]  It's like, oh, you're not media.
[00:25:38.362 --> 00:25:40.423]  That's because they're so incredibly scared.
[00:25:40.423 --> 00:25:41.764]  It's like Obama saying, oh.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.340]  Trump isn't eligible.
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.821]  Trump, Trump, Trump is disqualified.
[00:25:45.821 --> 00:25:47.241]  He isn't a real candidate.
[00:25:47.241 --> 00:25:49.682]  You people don't control reality anymore.
[00:25:49.682 --> 00:25:57.645]  So get ready coming up on the radio show today and tomorrow for us to break all of this down in detail with Roger Stone and more.
[00:25:57.645 --> 00:26:00.446]  Infowars.com forward slash show for all the details.
[00:26:00.446 --> 00:26:01.426]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:26:01.426 --> 00:26:08.109]  If you're watching this transmission or listening to it, folks, you're just as important as I am or Donald Trump or anybody else or Ron Paul.
[00:26:08.109 --> 00:26:09.009]  You are the resistance.
[00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:13.012]  Okay, folks, we're live.
[00:26:13.012 --> 00:26:17.697]  I am talking to Roger Stone right now, and we are all over the map.
[00:26:17.697 --> 00:26:20.840]  So what I want to do right now is talk about Super Tuesday coming up.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.103]  I want to talk about the Supreme Court situation.
[00:26:23.103 --> 00:26:27.648]  I'm going to go to break and talk to Stone for the three-minute break because I need to.
[00:26:27.648 --> 00:26:31.392]  He was just on the phone getting back to his house for 45 minutes with Donald Trump.
[00:26:31.832 --> 00:26:34.033]  So that's why he was unable to come on earlier.
[00:26:34.033 --> 00:26:37.095]  So we've got a whole bunch of key stuff coming up.
[00:26:37.095 --> 00:26:39.816]  So, Roger, I want to be careful about everything we were just talking about.
[00:26:39.816 --> 00:26:40.736]  I agree.
[00:26:40.736 --> 00:26:44.879]  So I want to talk to you during the break before we go public with some of this other breaking news.
[00:26:44.879 --> 00:26:51.802]  But let's just start right now with the Supreme Court situation with the report that you told me I could green light, which we've now launched.
[00:26:51.802 --> 00:26:53.963]  Roger Stone, Trump confidant.
[00:26:53.963 --> 00:26:56.184]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:26:56.184 --> 00:26:59.726]  Look, I think Trump, he's always been a law and order guy.
[00:27:00.453 --> 00:27:02.915]  And people want to know what kind of judges would he pick.
[00:27:02.915 --> 00:27:08.219]  Well, first of all, he is getting the short legal advice of Jeff Sessions, one of the great patriots in the U.S.
[00:27:08.219 --> 00:27:19.067]  Senate, a guy who understands the immigration problem inside and out, which shows kind of the president he would be, because he would pick excellent people and he would listen to them.
[00:27:19.067 --> 00:27:22.350]  And he would, he would, so I don't think Trump claims to know everything.
[00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.572]  He hasn't been in politics like these career politicians have.
[00:27:25.572 --> 00:27:27.474]  He's been building opportunity.
[00:27:28.235 --> 00:27:33.759]  Uh, and prosperity for a lot of people and making himself incredibly wealthy.
[00:27:33.759 --> 00:27:42.346]  Uh, now he's being harassed by the IRS, the same IRS that has multiple complaints about the law breaking going on, the Clinton Foundation, but chooses to look the other way.
[00:27:42.346 --> 00:27:50.892]  And at least 20 Republican Attorney Generals who've been presented the same information, says they have authority over charities, Alex.
[00:27:51.678 --> 00:27:57.604]  And not a single Republican Attorney General has had the guts to start to investigate what is a $2 billion global fraud.
[00:27:57.604 --> 00:28:05.673]  Meanwhile, they're harassing Donald Trump, an honest businessman, whose tax bill would probably blow all of our minds.
[00:28:05.673 --> 00:28:10.498]  It just shows, you know, it shows you how out of control the IRS is, which of course is a core part of the Trump message.
[00:28:12.452 --> 00:28:13.813]  Well, there's so much unfolding.
[00:28:13.813 --> 00:28:21.318]  We're going to break here in a moment and come back and talk about... 35,000 people waiting for Donald Trump to give a speech now.
[00:28:21.318 --> 00:28:22.679]  35,000 people.
[00:28:22.679 --> 00:28:24.700]  This is an insurrection, Alex.
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.481]  This is an uprising.
[00:28:26.481 --> 00:28:28.562]  And it's a big deal to have Senator Sessions.
[00:28:28.562 --> 00:28:31.704]  Drudge says that Sessions is about to endorse Trump.
[00:28:31.704 --> 00:28:32.245]  Is that the case?
[00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:35.492]  I believe that to be the case.
[00:28:35.492 --> 00:28:36.813]  I didn't know what the timing was.
[00:28:36.813 --> 00:28:39.195]  I knew the agreement to support him.
[00:28:39.195 --> 00:28:42.898]  Trump is a great admirer of Sessions.
[00:28:42.898 --> 00:28:45.740]  Trump is showing the only leadership on Sessions.
[00:28:56.952 --> 00:28:58.993]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[00:28:58.993 --> 00:29:00.234]  Try a bottle of it.
[00:29:00.234 --> 00:29:01.815]  Rob Dew joins us.
[00:29:01.815 --> 00:29:04.936]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[00:29:04.936 --> 00:29:05.997]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[00:29:05.997 --> 00:29:06.957]  I'd been working all day.
[00:29:06.957 --> 00:29:09.459]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[00:29:09.459 --> 00:29:10.879]  I get in here at 830.
[00:29:10.879 --> 00:29:12.800]  I was kind of run down.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.741]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[00:29:14.741 --> 00:29:16.602]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[00:29:16.602 --> 00:29:18.443]  I got my bottle of Brainforce right there.
[00:29:18.443 --> 00:29:19.504]  I popped two of them.
[00:29:19.504 --> 00:29:23.626]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like everything just kind of clears up.
[00:29:23.766 --> 00:29:25.206]  It's got four and a half stars.
[00:29:25.206 --> 00:29:26.546]  People really love it.
[00:29:26.546 --> 00:29:27.147]  Read about it.
[00:29:27.147 --> 00:29:36.448]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise, because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[00:29:36.448 --> 00:29:40.489]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[00:29:40.489 --> 00:29:46.630]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:51.551]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:29:59.378 --> 00:30:03.161]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:30:03.161 --> 00:30:10.886]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:30:10.886 --> 00:30:19.491]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:30:19.491 --> 00:30:23.934]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:30:23.934 --> 00:30:29.258]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:30:29.338 --> 00:30:30.338]  We're good to go.
[00:30:57.808 --> 00:31:01.309]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[00:32:54.571 --> 00:32:55.872]  Check it out for yourself today.
[00:33:01.306 --> 00:33:17.077]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:17.077 --> 00:33:24.742]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:26.997 --> 00:33:33.402]  Donald Trump has the Chinese government, the biggest murderers in history, saying, America, you don't dare elect him.
[00:33:33.402 --> 00:33:38.667]  We have the former Mexican president, Vicente Fox, cussing on TV, saying, how dare you want to have sovereignty?
[00:33:39.591 --> 00:33:47.753]  We've got the Democratic Party, the Republican Party leadership, the entire system, the Pope with a dead secretary found in his apartment saying, how dare you have Trump?
[00:33:47.753 --> 00:33:49.253]  You know, he's going to hell.
[00:33:49.253 --> 00:33:59.436]  It's so obvious the power structure is scared to death and we have the Trump confidant and inside of the former head of his campaign, Roger Stone, who just left Texas this morning at about 11 a.m.
[00:33:59.436 --> 00:34:04.757]  He is back at his home and he just talked to Trump for 45 minutes and so he's got a lot of intel.
[00:34:04.757 --> 00:34:07.338]  Let's walk through the new enemy attacks.
[00:34:07.338 --> 00:34:07.858]  Number one,
[00:34:08.678 --> 00:34:10.799]  Well, first of all, Alex, I'm delighted to be back with you.
[00:34:10.799 --> 00:34:14.960]  Now, in all honesty, I could never divulge the confidential details of a personal conversation with
[00:34:33.743 --> 00:34:36.884]  Donald Trump, as you know, who is- Yes, this isn't from Trump.
[00:34:36.884 --> 00:34:38.244]  This is from the other campaigns.
[00:34:38.244 --> 00:34:41.425]  For 40 years, other than, say, several.
[00:34:41.425 --> 00:34:48.527]  One, he has 35,000 people waiting for him on the ground at this upcoming unveiling.
[00:34:48.527 --> 00:34:59.511]  Senator Sessions, who is one of the real leaders in this country on immigration, a patriot, is emerging as Trump's best advisor, as we discussed.
[00:34:59.511 --> 00:35:00.551]  He's very pumped up.
[00:35:02.327 --> 00:35:08.911]  He knows that this is a fight for a nationalist agenda.
[00:35:08.911 --> 00:35:18.197]  He knows this is the biggest uprising in this country since Andrew Jackson gave us a more populist form of freedom.
[00:35:18.197 --> 00:35:28.324]  And it's interesting, because they said that Jackson was crude, and that he wasn't to the manner born, and that he was too blunt.
[00:35:28.324 --> 00:35:29.365]  What does this all sound like?
[00:35:30.331 --> 00:35:34.995]  And of course, as you know, Alex, he was one of our greatest presidents.
[00:35:34.995 --> 00:35:35.515]  Absolutely.
[00:35:35.515 --> 00:35:38.417]  Just recapping, this is national news, as you know.
[00:35:38.417 --> 00:35:42.701]  The Koch brothers coming, and then let's get into the Supreme Court situation briefly.
[00:35:42.701 --> 00:35:44.282]  This is very interesting.
[00:35:44.282 --> 00:35:50.907]  One thing I learned, and that is, if you want a bunch of cockroaches to scramble, you just have to shed light on them.
[00:35:50.907 --> 00:35:53.629]  And there's a cabal of billionaires.
[00:35:54.461 --> 00:35:55.082]  I don't know.
[00:36:14.898 --> 00:36:16.119]  With a better salesman.
[00:36:16.119 --> 00:36:21.841]  It's extreme bullshit, in terms of adherence to the globalist agenda.
[00:36:21.841 --> 00:36:25.062]  Big government, big spending, big debt, big war.
[00:36:25.062 --> 00:36:28.003]  So he'd be the third administration, that's why they've been grooming him.
[00:36:28.003 --> 00:36:42.229]  Right, you know, and that is, but they, Norman Brayman, the billionaire car dealer from Miami, Paul Singer, the billionaire hedge fund manager from Wall Street,
[00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:50.532]  The Koch brothers and a group of others that they accompanied.
[00:36:50.532 --> 00:37:05.777]  You see, the Kochs have among their conservative social friends an entire group of millionaires and billionaires who also have the same ambitions to control government for their own purposes.
[00:37:06.906 --> 00:37:13.070]  Although you will read in the media, Alex, that the number they ponied up was $25 million.
[00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:20.816]  In fact, if you stop Trump TV onslaught, they will spend at least $75 million.
[00:37:20.816 --> 00:37:27.880]  Additionally, this whole canard of Trump University, Trump University had a 98% student approval rating.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:34.285]  Now when Eric Schneiderman, the Attorney General of New York, attempted to shake down Trump and his daughter,
[00:37:34.893 --> 00:37:35.533]  And that's a fact.
[00:37:35.533 --> 00:37:37.334]  I mean, this is what they do.
[00:37:37.334 --> 00:37:40.455]  It's like the EEOC and all the rest of it is shaking people down.
[00:37:40.455 --> 00:37:41.656]  But let's expand on this now.
[00:38:00.947 --> 00:38:13.394]  People feature this and they're going to get individual people who gave the Trump University a lot of money, who knows how well they studied or followed their courses, but because they did not subsequently became rich, they filed a lawsuit.
[00:38:13.394 --> 00:38:18.517]  And they are less than 10% of the entire student body of this organization.
[00:38:18.517 --> 00:38:20.738]  The other people were happy with their results.
[00:38:20.738 --> 00:38:22.139]  They went on to make money.
[00:38:22.139 --> 00:38:24.400]  Some people win, some people lose.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.982]  It's based on the sweaty or growling good decisions you make.
[00:38:28.305 --> 00:38:37.949]  There's one remaining count in New York, and from very technical research, it's impossible for the AG to win, based on the previous decision throwing out all the other accounts.
[00:38:37.949 --> 00:38:39.030]  Well, let's expand on this.
[00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:40.510]  Let's expand on this, though.
[00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:42.351]  So, the Koch brothers are all in.
[00:38:42.351 --> 00:38:44.452]  They're coming in against Stephen.
[00:38:44.452 --> 00:38:46.653]  Now, let's get into the Supreme Court bombshell.
[00:38:46.653 --> 00:38:52.396]  And you also recognize, you've got, there's a whole, if Kasich is likely to win Ohio,
[00:38:53.044 --> 00:38:56.566]  The Republican Party of Ohio is functioning like a super PAC.
[00:38:56.566 --> 00:39:00.129]  The one thing these fellows do well is absentee ballots in early voting.
[00:39:00.129 --> 00:39:01.670]  They're masters at it.
[00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:13.017]  So, John Kasich, the moderate Republican governor of Ohio, is going to go into the Ohio primary with a half a million votes or more in the bank.
[00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:17.520]  Even if Trump wins on Election Day, that could do it.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:22.824]  And then, you know, let's just say, hypothetically, the crew is split by Trump, although I was in Austin.
[00:39:24.149 --> 00:39:29.833]  And as I told you, Alex, I walked from the Capitol all the way down 2nd Street.
[00:39:29.833 --> 00:39:32.575]  I had a hat and glasses, but the book had been recognized.
[00:39:32.575 --> 00:39:41.562]  The number of people who thanked me for what I was doing for Donald Trump in my country and told me they saw me with Alex Jones was mind-blowing.
[00:39:41.562 --> 00:39:42.702]  The patriots are out there.
[00:39:42.702 --> 00:39:43.883]  I'm seeing them every day.
[00:39:43.883 --> 00:39:45.004]  They're high-fiving me.
[00:39:45.004 --> 00:39:45.945]  This is the revolution.
[00:39:47.578 --> 00:39:56.326]  Well let's expand on that because we're going to break and I know you're tired but I have to hold you over because I want to get to the other big issue that I want to raise and that's this David Duke KKK stuff.
[00:39:56.326 --> 00:40:09.357]  That'd be like asking you do you rape your wife often or do you support Genghis Khan or you know oh hey you know a former Grand Dragon says he supports you on the borders and so you must be a Grand Dragon.
[00:40:09.357 --> 00:40:12.940]  Yeah look I remember something Ronald Reagan said when he was running for governor.
[00:40:14.056 --> 00:40:16.297]  He had many supporters in the John Birch Society.
[00:40:16.297 --> 00:40:19.637]  Now, the John Birch Society does not endorse candidates.
[00:40:19.637 --> 00:40:22.058]  And the society itself has some odd views.
[00:40:22.058 --> 00:40:25.078]  As a conservative, I found them odd views.
[00:40:25.078 --> 00:40:27.579]  I thought the people who were members were good people.
[00:40:27.579 --> 00:40:28.959]  They were patriotic Americans.
[00:40:28.959 --> 00:40:32.239]  I just think maybe they'd gone a bit overboard.
[00:40:32.239 --> 00:40:36.260]  They would always ask Reagan, though, aren't you affiliated with the John Birch Society?
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:40.781]  And he would say, if somebody supports me, that means they support my agenda.
[00:40:40.781 --> 00:40:41.561]  Not that I support
[00:40:42.794 --> 00:40:46.076]  And I'm sure that's Trump's response, but they just ask him, who is this?
[00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:47.576]  And he's like, huh?
[00:40:47.576 --> 00:40:51.158]  Because it's just, it's just so weird to say, what do you think of Mao Zedong?
[00:40:51.158 --> 00:40:54.079]  Or what do you think of, you know, Jimmy the Cricket?
[00:40:54.079 --> 00:40:59.482]  Well, yeah, see he's not, but what they don't understand is he doesn't know that he doesn't, there's two possibilities.
[00:40:59.482 --> 00:41:05.165]  Either he doesn't know who David Duke is, or he was confused by Duke's extensive plastic surgery.
[00:41:05.165 --> 00:41:05.645]  One of the two.
[00:41:07.188 --> 00:41:10.271]  I mean, he doesn't know this guy ran for governor and did well.
[00:41:10.271 --> 00:41:12.733]  He doesn't know that he's a hater and a bigot.
[00:41:12.733 --> 00:41:14.754]  You know, this is an attempt to smear Trump.
[00:41:14.754 --> 00:41:18.737]  Well, that's my issue, is these white supremacist groups usually, it turns out, are fed run.
[00:41:18.737 --> 00:41:25.723]  I don't know about Duke, but I know these people attack me all the time for no reason, just because I don't hate blacks or Jews or whoever.
[00:41:25.723 --> 00:41:29.666]  And if they want Donald Trump to lose, they should just continue doing what they're doing, which is what they do.
[00:41:29.666 --> 00:41:31.588]  I mean, how many of these things that turn out are fed run?
[00:41:32.546 --> 00:41:34.987]  Oh, that's exactly right Alex, you put your finger on it.
[00:41:34.987 --> 00:41:38.589]  So this is an attempt to discredit Trump because they want to blunt the revolution.
[00:41:38.589 --> 00:41:39.589]  Here's the point.
[00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:47.552]  Trump has created thousands of jobs for black people, brown people, Christians, Muslims.
[00:41:47.552 --> 00:41:50.213]  Trump is not a hater and he has no time for haters.
[00:41:50.213 --> 00:41:52.694]  He also has no time to be politically correct.
[00:41:52.694 --> 00:41:58.677]  He sees the country going down the toilet and he sees the hands of Wall Street about to pull the flush lever.
[00:42:00.145 --> 00:42:05.067]  That's right, repeat that, because I actually didn't accidentally hit a button trying to punch up a screen and cut you off for a second.
[00:42:05.067 --> 00:42:06.707]  Repeat what you just said, Mr. Stone.
[00:42:06.707 --> 00:42:15.810]  I mean, really, you're to the point where the American people, Donald Trump is tired of seeing the country going down the toilet and the Wall Street and Washington, D.C.
[00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:17.531]  crowd with their hands on the flush lever.
[00:42:19.514 --> 00:42:20.494]  That's where we are.
[00:42:20.494 --> 00:42:27.357]  It's incredible how they have La Raza and Mecha and all these Hispanic Klan groups running around saying, for those inside our race, everything.
[00:42:27.357 --> 00:42:30.218]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[00:42:30.218 --> 00:42:32.099]  If I was Trump, I'd say, I'm for everybody.
[00:42:32.099 --> 00:42:33.880]  I'm against Mecha and La Raza.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:37.301]  Look, I have every confidence that the race goes down in Trump's address.
[00:42:37.301 --> 00:42:38.802]  Trump is not a bigot in any way.
[00:42:38.802 --> 00:42:40.382]  This is an attempt to make him look like one.
[00:42:40.382 --> 00:42:41.763]  Sure, but he doesn't... I'm the same way.
[00:42:41.763 --> 00:42:43.443]  People ask me, are you racist against black people?
[00:42:43.443 --> 00:42:47.285]  I don't answer the question, because it's putting you on the spot like they have the moral high ground.
[00:42:47.685 --> 00:42:51.989]  I assure you, Trump has been paying attention to building a billion dollars.
[00:42:51.989 --> 00:42:53.950]  He doesn't know that Sharma's brain is for government.
[00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:54.571]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:54.571 --> 00:42:58.794]  I want to get to the other final point straight ahead.
[00:42:58.794 --> 00:43:04.339]  It turns out Hillary Clinton and her top aides aren't the only ones with secret email aliases.
[00:43:04.339 --> 00:43:14.507]  Documents uncovered through the Freedom of Information Act reveal that former Attorney General Eric Holder used a false name for his official Justice Department email account.
[00:43:14.787 --> 00:43:25.477]  According to documents obtained by Vice News, all mentions of Lou Alcindor, the birth name of basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, were actually referring to Holder himself.
[00:43:25.477 --> 00:43:36.748]  In response to the FOIA release, a Justice Department spokesman said that Holder's actions, they're not improper, legally questionable, or used to thwart FOIA requests seeking information on the former Attorney General.
[00:43:37.208 --> 00:43:38.950]  Hmm, where have we heard that before?
[00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:49.980]  Experts in FOIA law say holders' Lou Alcindor identity calls into question the ability of FOIA staff to locate all emails from an official who uses an alias.
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:50.740]  Indeed.

[00:44:54.625 --> 00:44:59.086]  Good, brother.
[00:44:59.086 --> 00:45:00.826]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:45:00.826 --> 00:45:02.747]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:45:02.747 --> 00:45:06.767]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:45:06.767 --> 00:45:09.408]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:45:09.408 --> 00:45:11.828]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:45:11.828 --> 00:45:19.670]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.

[00:45:27.696 --> 00:45:29.457]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:45:29.457 --> 00:45:32.199]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[00:45:32.199 --> 00:45:35.261]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[00:45:35.521 --> 00:45:37.303]  Or maximum potency.
[00:45:37.303 --> 00:45:47.533]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[00:45:47.533 --> 00:45:49.315]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:45:49.315 --> 00:45:56.262]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.

[00:46:39.154 --> 00:46:43.016]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:46:43.456 --> 00:46:44.757]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:35.968]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:35.968 --> 00:47:38.470]  Oh, you want to hear the behind-the-scenes inside baseball.
[00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:40.971]  Okay, so we walk through all these points.
[00:47:42.253 --> 00:47:49.997]  Roger Stone, the confidant of Donald Trump, the 40-plus year friend, the guy that previously ran his campaign, but he wanted to be more aggressive, so he went out on his own.
[00:47:49.997 --> 00:47:51.138]  A lot of folks do that.
[00:47:51.138 --> 00:47:52.078]  He's with us right now.
[00:47:52.078 --> 00:47:54.899]  Then Richard Reeves, our political correspondent, is going to be popping in.
[00:47:54.899 --> 00:47:56.540]  Then open phones and a bunch of other news.
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:57.401]  There's a ton to cover.
[00:47:58.001 --> 00:47:58.241]  All right.
[00:48:14.429 --> 00:48:16.773]  All of them coming out against Trump.
[00:48:16.773 --> 00:48:18.777]  Unprecedented populist candidate.
[00:48:18.777 --> 00:48:19.979]  Unbelievable.
[00:48:19.979 --> 00:48:25.488]  As soon as Sanders is out, all of his people need to come over to Trump because they know Hillary has been cheating Sanders.
[00:48:25.488 --> 00:48:27.191]  Huge, huge things that are happening.
[00:48:27.191 --> 00:48:27.832]  But Mr. Stone...
[00:48:28.584 --> 00:48:35.950]  Getting to the video that went live at Infowars.com about an hour ago and that is there right now.
[00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.572]  Now, again, at first you didn't even want me to repeat this.
[00:48:38.572 --> 00:48:41.854]  Then by yesterday you said you can talk about part of it.
[00:48:41.854 --> 00:48:43.756]  By today you said you can talk about more of it.
[00:48:43.756 --> 00:48:45.437]  To me it's a big game changer.
[00:48:45.437 --> 00:48:53.724]  Yeah, you know Alex, I do want to talk to you about the back play here involving all three presidential candidates.
[00:48:53.724 --> 00:48:57.707]  I have now confirmed without any doubt Mrs. Marco Rubio
[00:48:58.502 --> 00:48:59.763]  We're good to go.
[00:49:23.835 --> 00:49:26.177]  That's right, but now the Supreme Court bombshell.
[00:49:26.177 --> 00:49:26.437]  That's big!
[00:49:49.139 --> 00:49:55.922]  Uh, and they, uh, and they support the idea that Cruz, whose votes most definitely are being siphoned... Let me just stop you.
[00:49:55.922 --> 00:49:57.122]  You didn't want to go there.
[00:49:57.122 --> 00:49:58.083]  It's okay now?
[00:49:58.083 --> 00:50:01.704]  Because I only talked about... We can, but all my words are precise.
[00:50:01.704 --> 00:50:02.764]  I only talked about Rubio.
[00:50:02.764 --> 00:50:03.785]  Okay, go ahead then.
[00:50:03.785 --> 00:50:04.585]  You've got the floor.
[00:50:04.585 --> 00:50:14.629]  Uh, uh, so Cruz, uh, Cruz, uh, the Cruz folks floated a proposal to some people associated with Trump, uh, and, uh,
[00:50:15.996 --> 00:50:30.662]  It was very clear this was an authorized reach-out, and a proposal put together in which Raphael would drop out of the race in return for a Supreme Court nomination at some point down the road.
[00:50:30.662 --> 00:50:40.767]  Now, such a deal would be illegal were Trump ever to agree with it, and there was, from what I'm told, there was no receptivity.
[00:50:40.767 --> 00:50:45.389]  Now, I did not speak with Donald Trump about this matter personally, because I would never divulge
[00:50:46.383 --> 00:50:49.084]  It's a personal, privileged conversation with a friend.
[00:50:49.084 --> 00:50:52.966]  I want to stress again, I have no formal nor informal rule.
[00:50:52.966 --> 00:50:59.829]  Because I am involved with the Super PAC, and this is very important, I had to go ahead and write a legal opinion that says I am entitled to talk with Trump.
[00:50:59.829 --> 00:51:08.373]  I am just not entitled to talk about certain things pertaining to advertising or themes of other independent efforts that I may be involved in.
[00:51:08.373 --> 00:51:10.274]  And I have never done so.
[00:51:10.274 --> 00:51:12.135]  Our conversations are private.
[00:51:12.759 --> 00:51:13.159]  A maverick.
[00:51:34.287 --> 00:51:36.648]  Uh, he understands the news cycle and how to make news.
[00:51:36.648 --> 00:51:39.009]  He knows who's trying to stop him, the Wall Street Boys.
[00:51:39.009 --> 00:51:54.094]  He laughs at them for paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for these swells, the long biggest club in Fort Lauderdale, when in all honesty he goes down to the Five Guys with his security guys and eats burgers rather than eat with some of these Wall Street titans.
[00:51:56.758 --> 00:51:59.479]  He's a man, he's his own self.
[00:51:59.479 --> 00:52:06.440]  So expanding on this though, so they reached out to Trump and then, I wish you could tell folks what was said.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:11.741]  It is my understanding that there was no interest, any such, from Trump.
[00:52:11.741 --> 00:52:12.321]  From Trump.
[00:52:12.321 --> 00:52:15.002]  Now let's talk about Rubio, because that was the part I was authorized to talk about.
[00:52:15.002 --> 00:52:22.703]  Subsequently, I heard from the same source who attended the Secret Insider, partly, in New York City.
[00:52:23.567 --> 00:52:37.678]  Where the Koch Brothers ultimately pull together a large contingent of millionaires and billionaires who have an agenda, an establishment agenda.
[00:52:38.297 --> 00:52:45.041]  And they, uh, they raised not $25,000, as was recorded, but $75,000 for a virulent.
[00:52:45.041 --> 00:52:46.481]  $75 million.
[00:52:46.481 --> 00:52:47.782]  $75 million, pardon me.
[00:52:47.782 --> 00:52:55.466]  They gave another $25 million to Marco, but it is my understanding they also let it be known that he had until the Florida primary to show that he can take down Trump.
[00:52:55.706 --> 00:52:56.486]  Sure.
[00:52:56.486 --> 00:52:58.167]  I know you've gone back because it's so huge.
[00:52:58.167 --> 00:52:59.608]  That story went viral on Drudge.
[00:52:59.608 --> 00:53:01.949]  What's not known is this other thing about the Supreme Court.
[00:53:01.949 --> 00:53:04.831]  To me, that is so seismic.
[00:53:04.831 --> 00:53:20.679]  Alex, I believe the same proposal was put to Rubio, but with Rubio it was, Ched will stay in the race and continue to drain conservative votes from Trump in return for a Supreme Court commitment.
[00:53:20.679 --> 00:53:22.861]  Now, of course, even in that Faustian bargain,
[00:53:25.157 --> 00:53:34.443]  The party that would have to perform first, second in this case, would be Trump.
[00:53:34.443 --> 00:53:41.468]  I just could never, knowing him 40 years, he would never, you know, clearly his legal counsel would tell him that this isn't even imaginable.
[00:53:41.468 --> 00:53:45.870]  Plus... But the word is Rubio doesn't even trust Cruz and said no.
[00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:49.653]  And why would you put a man who you call the biggest liar in the world, not incorrect?
[00:53:50.607 --> 00:53:52.068]  On the Supreme Court.
[00:53:52.068 --> 00:53:54.910]  I'm certain Trump would have no receptivity.
[00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:59.914]  And evidently, Rubio has no such interest either.
[00:53:59.914 --> 00:54:01.075]  He's going to run his race.
[00:54:01.075 --> 00:54:03.097]  That is such a big deal.
[00:54:03.097 --> 00:54:05.178]  That is so huge.
[00:54:05.178 --> 00:54:11.883]  The people around Marco Rubio are some very skilled, talented people.
[00:54:11.883 --> 00:54:13.965]  They work very hard and they know what they're doing.
[00:54:13.965 --> 00:54:19.469]  And he has improved so much in time that I'm proud to say I voted for him in his primary again.
[00:54:20.382 --> 00:54:20.982]  Certainly correct.
[00:54:37.967 --> 00:54:46.771]  My only issue here is that now they're making it, their new attack is, you need to come out and decry this guy or that guy.
[00:54:46.771 --> 00:54:50.873]  And I can get not responding because then it'll be, well what do you think about Jeffrey Dahmer?
[00:54:50.873 --> 00:54:53.554]  Well, what do you think about, you know, this person or that person?
[00:54:53.554 --> 00:54:55.575]  Respond to this, respond to that.
[00:54:55.575 --> 00:55:00.377]  But at the same time, I mean, seeing Trump saying, I love black people, I love Hispanics, you know, I love everybody.
[00:55:00.377 --> 00:55:02.498]  Talking to folks that have worked for him, see that's really how it is.
[00:55:03.319 --> 00:55:05.020]  No, it's an obvious smear.
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:18.015]  It's an obvious attempt to discredit him by tying him to a bunch of probably huge Aryan federal agents and booklings in the case of most of these white supremacist hate groups.
[00:55:18.015 --> 00:55:21.379]  And you know, the media always finds three skinheads who are in a rally with 35,000 people.
[00:55:23.266 --> 00:55:31.010]  I've been at pro-gun rallies where two of them show up and you later learn they're federal informants, and the media ask, why is the Klan here?
[00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:32.270]  And I'm just like, really?
[00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:34.992]  I just want to support rights of self-defense.
[00:55:34.992 --> 00:55:36.012]  Yeah.
[00:55:36.012 --> 00:55:44.356]  Yeah, no, it's that, look, if Klansmen show up at the rallies, you'll know that the Dirty Trick Squad that Ted Cruz runs around is doing their job.
[00:55:45.928 --> 00:55:48.510]  I remember Rand Paul.
[00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:49.371]  We caught Democrats.
[00:55:49.371 --> 00:55:50.072]  We actually caught him.
[00:55:50.072 --> 00:55:52.134]  We did a Google scan of the faces.
[00:55:52.134 --> 00:55:59.460]  And when he was about to win the Senate, they had Democrats dressed up in hayseed outfits with like KKK signs and I hate Mexican signs.
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:06.346]  And it turned out they worked directly in the campaign, paid members of the Democrat guy he was running against.
[00:56:06.346 --> 00:56:07.968]  So we know this is going on.
[00:56:07.968 --> 00:56:11.211]  We got to get the intel to Trump so that he understands what they're running here.
[00:56:11.451 --> 00:56:13.792]  So who do you expect behind this then?
[00:56:13.792 --> 00:56:17.795]  You think it might actually be one of his competitors?
[00:56:17.795 --> 00:56:19.636]  I don't necessarily trace it to any.
[00:56:19.636 --> 00:56:22.137]  I really think it's an attempt by the media.
[00:56:22.137 --> 00:56:30.642]  Most of the left-driven media has grabbed on this as a way to, you know, and Trump is not even aware of who this guy is.
[00:56:30.642 --> 00:56:34.364]  He just failed, you know, a would-be latter-day George
[00:56:35.356 --> 00:56:36.357]  Yeah, let's be honest.
[00:56:36.357 --> 00:56:40.879]  You've told me Trump's one blind spot is he doesn't really even watch mainstream media.
[00:56:40.879 --> 00:56:41.860]  He reads mail.
[00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:43.421]  He reads newspapers.
[00:56:43.421 --> 00:56:46.042]  He works like 20 hours a day, like a Superman.
[00:56:46.042 --> 00:56:46.763]  And that's confirmed.
[00:56:46.763 --> 00:56:48.004]  He sleeps three hours a night.
[00:56:48.004 --> 00:56:52.967]  But he has major blind spots for certain... Well, I would say not blind spots.
[00:56:52.967 --> 00:56:57.950]  In this case, like Ronald Reagan, he has no interest in the arcana of American politics.
[00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:58.550]  That's what he said.
[00:56:58.550 --> 00:56:59.451]  I was focused on business.
[00:56:59.451 --> 00:57:00.211]  Now it's politics.
[00:57:00.211 --> 00:57:01.032]  Who?
[00:57:01.032 --> 00:57:02.192]  The guy that wears a white hat?
[00:57:02.192 --> 00:57:02.312]  What?
[00:57:07.335 --> 00:57:07.575]  Absolutely.
[00:57:07.575 --> 00:57:09.396]  If you're against the U.N.
[00:57:09.396 --> 00:57:13.698]  running things, they say you're a Nazi, and now they're telling Trump he's a Nazi.
[00:57:13.698 --> 00:57:15.299]  This is exactly what they do.
[00:57:15.299 --> 00:57:15.819]  Incredible.
[00:57:27.105 --> 00:57:28.967]  Roger Stone, you've already given us 30 minutes.
[00:57:28.967 --> 00:57:30.449]  We've got a 60-second break.
[00:57:30.449 --> 00:57:33.893]  I want to just come back and put bookends on this and talk about your two new books that are out.
[00:57:33.893 --> 00:57:35.335]  Then Richard Reeves is coming in.
[00:57:35.335 --> 00:57:36.576]  Calls and more straight ahead.
[00:57:36.576 --> 00:57:37.357]  Second hour.
[00:57:37.357 --> 00:57:38.979]  Tell your friends and family to tune in.
[00:57:38.979 --> 00:57:40.261]  History is happening right now.
[00:57:40.261 --> 00:57:41.943]  Infowars.com.
[00:57:41.943 --> 00:57:45.567]  We have 30% off everything for the leap year sale and free shipping and ends tomorrow.
[00:57:45.567 --> 00:57:46.108]  Biggest sale ever.

[00:57:55.338 --> 00:58:02.641]  Until Monday at midnight, you can get 30% off everything at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:02.641 --> 00:58:09.564]  That's the non-GMO heirloom seeds, the water filtration systems, the incredible high-quality nutraceuticals, vitamins, and minerals.
[00:58:09.784 --> 00:58:09.964]  I think.
[00:58:25.299 --> 00:58:33.421]  And more at InfoWarsLives.com and InfoWarsStore.com or simply call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:58:33.421 --> 00:58:43.964]  And finally, from yours truly, Alex Jones, to all the patriots of every race, color, and creed across this country and the world, I salute you for your tireless fight against tyranny and your support of the InfoWar.
[00:58:43.964 --> 00:58:45.825]  Without you, none of this is possible.
[00:58:47.688 --> 00:58:50.891]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:58:50.891 --> 00:58:53.253]  Deep Cleanze by Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:53.253 --> 00:59:00.259]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[00:59:00.259 --> 00:59:05.584]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[00:59:05.584 --> 00:59:14.572]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[00:59:15.012 --> 00:59:23.882]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[00:59:23.882 --> 00:59:30.970]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spite G-Rex herbal processing technique.
[00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:36.356]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs, backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best.
[00:59:36.476 --> 00:59:37.456]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:00.911 --> 01:00:07.558]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:07.558 --> 01:00:12.223]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.223 --> 01:00:19.311]  This is the bottom line on David Duke, the federally controlled KKK, the Southern Property Law Center, and all these usual suspects.
[01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:32.601]  David Duke, from the beginning, has been endorsing Donald Trump knowing that he would become a major campaign issue and have his name out there associated with Donald Trump.
[01:00:32.601 --> 01:00:43.844]  And so, he wants to get attention for himself at the expense of getting Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders into office and killing this country.
[01:00:43.844 --> 01:00:44.925]  And that is despicable.
[01:00:46.397 --> 01:00:49.818]  And again, I just don't respect people that run around in hoods.
[01:00:49.818 --> 01:00:51.439]  All the rest of them, we need to bring this country together.
[01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:58.581]  And, you know, there's Donald Trump with all these great people, white, black, Hispanic, Asian up there about unifying people.
[01:00:58.581 --> 01:00:59.821]  Now he's hugging everybody.
[01:00:59.821 --> 01:01:02.282]  You don't see David Duke at a rally hugging black people.
[01:01:03.157 --> 01:01:11.441]  And so, David Duke, I am for inclusion, I am for all races coming together, so you and all your cohorts attack me all day, why are you hypocrites then saying you like Trump?
[01:01:11.441 --> 01:01:22.185]  Because you want to rattle his coattails, and I bet some of these groups are getting paid to sabotage in the media, the whore media, the prostitute media is part of this, and I'm sick of it!
[01:01:22.185 --> 01:01:26.307]  I'm sick of you parasites attaching yourselves to somebody like Donald Trump.
[01:01:26.307 --> 01:01:30.709]  Roger Stone, StoneZone.com, Trump Insider, what do you say to that?
[01:01:31.704 --> 01:01:33.425]  No, Alex, I think you're right on the money.
[01:01:33.425 --> 01:01:37.847]  I'm still here at the airport, as you can hear, so we get a little overhead traffic.
[01:01:37.847 --> 01:01:39.108]  I am, uh, you're absolutely right.
[01:01:39.108 --> 01:01:47.392]  This is an attempt to smear Donald Trump by, uh, you know, uh, this is a guilt by association attempt by mainstream media.
[01:01:47.392 --> 01:01:49.473]  Look who's reporting this story.
[01:01:49.473 --> 01:01:52.834]  David Duke, you know, Trump, they asked Trump a question.
[01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:54.715]  He doesn't know much about Duke.
[01:01:54.715 --> 01:01:56.556]  He does know he doesn't like haters.
[01:01:56.556 --> 01:01:58.017]  He's not a big fan of the Klan.
[01:01:58.815 --> 01:01:59.775]  This is an absurdity.
[01:01:59.775 --> 01:02:01.836]  It's a mugging.
[01:02:01.836 --> 01:02:22.240]  We know by his record the thousands of jobs and opportunities he's created for black people, his incredible friendship with some of the greatest black athletes, his close association with Muhammad Ali, one of his closest friends, very, very close to the late Floyd Patterson, very, very close to smoking Joe Frazier.
[01:02:23.248 --> 01:02:29.514]  It's more political correctness garbage, and Trump shouldn't have to bow every time somebody brings up a name and say, I don't like him.
[01:02:29.514 --> 01:02:34.938]  But in this case, obviously I expect he will soon, because this is a way to cut the coattails off.
[01:02:34.938 --> 01:02:36.580]  It's a way to stop this.
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:40.603]  And again, it is so disgusting to see the establishment media rolling this out.
[01:02:40.603 --> 01:02:41.204]  It's all they got.
[01:02:41.204 --> 01:02:46.909]  But it's more of the political correctness that he's helping shatter, and that's why they hate him so much.
[01:02:46.909 --> 01:02:48.850]  Yeah, so this is a smear attempt.
[01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:50.392]  It's an attempt to persuade
[01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:57.160]  People may be thinking about Trump and looking at their alternative.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:01.864]  Meanwhile, poor Bernie Sanders is getting rolled by the machine.
[01:03:01.864 --> 01:03:06.307]  Meanwhile, Hillary called black people super predators and said they've got to be watched.
[01:03:06.307 --> 01:03:07.128]  It's worse.
[01:03:07.128 --> 01:03:09.209]  She said they need to be made to heal.
[01:03:09.209 --> 01:03:10.330]  Like a dog?
[01:03:10.330 --> 01:03:12.091]  Then she barked like a dog.
[01:03:12.091 --> 01:03:15.894]  Then her husband shouted down a veteran, a man who, unlike Graf Dodger Bill,
[01:03:16.542 --> 01:03:17.723]  He does look like he has dementia.
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:49.864]  Well, there's one other thing I have to mention, because I think it's important, and that is, as you may have seen, I, you and I, have both been under attack by Media Matters for America.
[01:03:49.864 --> 01:03:51.305]  White House run?
[01:03:51.305 --> 01:03:55.467]  Which is, which is completely an appendage of the Clinton operation.
[01:03:55.467 --> 01:04:01.790]  It is a bunch of Clinton psychofans, and mostly children, with... Well, former members of the White House.
[01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:25.367]  Yeah, and they have some intelligent leftists that work there, but in all honesty, they take tweets where I use the word, probably intemperately, negro, but in their text they spell it out, and dash, dash, dash, trying to give people the association that I use the N-word, a word that, if I used, my mother would have washed my mouth out with soap.
[01:04:25.367 --> 01:04:27.909]  They play games, they keep claiming I'm racist.
[01:04:27.909 --> 01:04:29.750]  Was I a little intemperate?
[01:04:32.922 --> 01:04:38.206]  Well, Roger Stone, your books are available at InfoWarsStore.com or StoneZone.com.
[01:04:38.206 --> 01:04:43.370]  The Bush crime family and of course the whole book about the sex crimes of Bill Clinton and Hillary covering it up.
[01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:44.231]  Great job.
[01:04:44.231 --> 01:04:47.093]  Hopefully you can pop back in tomorrow, but you deserve a rest this evening.
[01:04:47.093 --> 01:04:48.535]  I'm going to say bye to you during the break.
[01:04:48.535 --> 01:04:49.936]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:04:49.936 --> 01:04:51.457]  Our site is InfoWars.com.
[01:04:51.457 --> 01:04:53.418]  Our backup site is PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:04:53.418 --> 01:04:55.160]  We're running the biggest sale in our history right now.
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.501]  30% off and free shipping.
[01:04:59.364 --> 01:05:03.147]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:05:03.147 --> 01:05:10.892]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:05:10.892 --> 01:05:19.518]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:05:19.518 --> 01:05:23.920]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:29.224]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:05:29.344 --> 01:05:30.344]  We're good to go.
[01:05:59.215 --> 01:06:01.477]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[01:06:01.477 --> 01:06:07.181]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[01:06:07.181 --> 01:06:13.225]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[01:06:13.225 --> 01:06:16.187]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[01:06:16.187 --> 01:06:20.550]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:22.932]  And I hope that judge ain't blind.
[01:06:22.932 --> 01:06:27.075]  I'm a rebel by morning.
[01:06:28.933 --> 01:06:39.701]  I'll tell you, Roger Stone just keeps laying out bombshell after bombshell, so we've held him over again.
[01:06:39.701 --> 01:06:46.846]  And people around the office mentioned this after the Republican debate last week, and I had watched it, but I was covering it, so I'd missed this part.
[01:06:46.846 --> 01:06:48.687]  I later went and found it online.
[01:06:48.687 --> 01:06:50.068]  I just sprung this on the crew to find it.
[01:06:50.068 --> 01:06:53.251]  I don't know if they can do it right now, but people online had the clip of
[01:06:54.091 --> 01:07:05.078]  Donald Trump up there, speaking, and then on split screen on CNN, George Herbert Walker Bush, Bush 41, doing a throat-slitting motion.
[01:07:05.078 --> 01:07:05.758]  Amazing!
[01:07:05.758 --> 01:07:09.340]  And I know that you're mom's Sicilians, you can speak to this.
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:16.805]  You were just, in fact, we're showing the throat-slitting now on screen, and, you know, Barbara, Barbara has openly talked about, if you mess with my family, I'll kill you.
[01:07:17.145 --> 01:07:22.507]  This is the true American Mafia beyond any Sicilian La Cosa Nostra or family.
[01:07:22.507 --> 01:07:35.613]  But you were bringing this up as a final point about how creepy these people are and the fact that we shot a video, we're going to air it later in the show, where Austinites, the majority of Democrats, said, oh, we heard about the New York Times showing Kill Trump.
[01:07:35.613 --> 01:07:36.393]  We want him dead!
[01:07:36.393 --> 01:07:37.594]  Hurry up and kill him!
[01:07:37.594 --> 01:07:40.075]  I mean, what a vicious group of people.
[01:07:40.075 --> 01:07:45.497]  It's amazing to me that I evidently am part of CNN, where this
[01:07:46.024 --> 01:07:59.156]  A fellow named Wilson, who claims to be a political consultant, but is really just a small-time kind of loudmouth, has gone on and called on Twitter on his feet and called for somebody to put a bullet in Don Trump.
[01:07:59.156 --> 01:08:08.404]  He's accused my friend Ian Coulter, who is a great author and a great fighter for American sovereignty and a real nationalist,
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:14.784]  He's insinuated that she and Donald Trump must have had anal sex because she's a Trump supporter.
[01:08:14.784 --> 01:08:17.166]  He is still on CNN.
[01:08:17.166 --> 01:08:31.979]  Yet, because I point out that their political correspondent, Anna Navarro, who by the way is essentially living a rickety lifestyle funded by the taxpayers because she
[01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:37.331]  You were just pointing out she's never been in politics or involved and CNN's got a bunch of idiots.
[01:09:00.905 --> 01:09:03.586]  She's never worked in any of Jeb's campaigns.
[01:09:03.586 --> 01:09:05.087]  She's never worked in any campaign.
[01:09:05.087 --> 01:09:08.048]  Sure, let's talk about the Italian throat-slitting though.
[01:09:08.048 --> 01:09:09.869]  I think this is the absolute key.
[01:09:09.869 --> 01:09:11.669]  Here's the history on this.
[01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:12.830]  I was flying in the air.
[01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:15.791]  I was flying and I watched the big later.
[01:09:15.791 --> 01:09:23.754]  Before I watched it, my 91-year-old mother, who watched every bit of it, said, boy, George Bush sure don't like your friend Donald Trump.
[01:09:23.754 --> 01:09:25.174]  I said, what do you mean, Mom?
[01:09:25.174 --> 01:09:26.355]  And she told me about it.
[01:09:26.355 --> 01:09:27.055]  Then I called
[01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:40.396]  One of the Trump Advancement, who happens to be a friend, and I asked him what happened, and he said, no, it was very clear that he was, that this was directed towards the boss, then asked, and then they edited it out of the CNN push.
[01:09:40.396 --> 01:09:44.119]  Yeah, he looked right at Trump when he was, and just says, I'm going to slit your throat.
[01:09:44.119 --> 01:09:44.720]  Right, right.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:49.283]  Which is reminiscent, by the way, of in the famous Robert Caro book, when Caro asked
[01:09:50.094 --> 01:09:50.434]  I don't
[01:10:10.499 --> 01:10:20.746]  Who was a Wheeler dealer who Johnson was making millions with, and who in many ways played a key role and had knowledge of Johnson's role in the Kennedy assassination.
[01:10:20.746 --> 01:10:22.367]  Simply, simply incredible.
[01:10:22.367 --> 01:10:27.771]  The whole power structure is against Trump, and I think the fact that they just pile on is only going to backfire on them.
[01:10:27.771 --> 01:10:37.858]  No, anyway, the Trump, pardon me, at that point the Bush spinners said that no, that the old man Bush was getting such a hand, he was trying to tell people to cut the applause.
[01:10:38.985 --> 01:10:42.186]  I ask you Alex, look at the look in his eyes as he glares at Trump.
[01:10:42.186 --> 01:10:44.646]  He's glaring like an evil snapping turtle.
[01:10:44.646 --> 01:10:54.108]  And the timing of it, and that contradicts the timing of it, of a Trump advance man who was 15 steps away watching it with his own eyes.
[01:10:54.108 --> 01:10:55.528]  This was the omerta.
[01:10:55.528 --> 01:10:59.369]  This was the death sign for Donald Trump.
[01:10:59.369 --> 01:11:01.509]  The establishment's all out.
[01:11:01.509 --> 01:11:03.970]  Barbara Bush is charged up.
[01:11:04.813 --> 01:11:07.234]  Because Jeb didn't get his birthright.
[01:11:07.234 --> 01:11:08.814]  How would you feel if you were Mitt Romney?
[01:11:08.814 --> 01:11:11.155]  You didn't run because... Hey, he's like Kim Jong-un.
[01:11:11.155 --> 01:11:14.016]  I mean, they deserve a third dynasty just like North Korea.
[01:11:14.016 --> 01:11:15.077]  And that's what it's all about.
[01:11:15.077 --> 01:11:16.777]  Roger, thank you for all the time.
[01:11:16.777 --> 01:11:18.018]  Get some well-earned rest.
[01:11:18.018 --> 01:11:20.618]  Amazing crowds here in Austin for you.
[01:11:20.618 --> 01:11:23.219]  And just thank you so much for all the work you're doing.
[01:11:23.219 --> 01:11:26.000]  No, no, look, because George Bush Sr.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:33.623]  is a guy who always tries to hide in the shadows, that video, I think, is the coda to his 88 years as a duplicitous
[01:11:34.306 --> 01:11:37.128]  Sociopathic power wheel.
[01:11:37.128 --> 01:11:43.491]  Well sure, he didn't show up to the other debates, but now that his son loses, he crawls out from under a rock, and now his protégé is Rubio.
[01:11:43.491 --> 01:11:46.333]  Well, and CNN described him as beloved.
[01:11:46.333 --> 01:11:46.713]  Really?
[01:11:46.713 --> 01:11:47.833]  Beloved?
[01:11:47.833 --> 01:11:50.115]  Ask the guys who he bailed out of on the plane.
[01:11:50.115 --> 01:11:52.356]  They went down and died because he ejected her.
[01:11:52.356 --> 01:11:55.258]  Or all the SNLs they robbed, or the people that voted him out of office.
[01:11:55.258 --> 01:11:56.518]  Yeah, it's beloved.
[01:11:56.518 --> 01:12:01.861]  Or their funding of eugenics, so that we can just sterilize people inferior to us.
[01:12:01.861 --> 01:12:03.202]  Now that's in the whole Kissinger document.
[01:12:04.232 --> 01:12:10.204]  Well, I mean, look, Prescott Bush is one of the major... and his partner, Harriman, are one of the major... Top Hitler assets!
[01:12:13.408 --> 01:12:15.250]  You can't make that stuff up.
[01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:17.792]  It's just like George Soros.
[01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:18.813]  You can't write this stuff.
[01:12:18.813 --> 01:12:20.134]  It's just real truth.
[01:12:20.134 --> 01:12:25.258]  Let me explain how incredible their control is.
[01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:39.771]  A group of researchers who are very respected and were involved in the terrific book, The Unauthorized Biography of George Bush, located the actual document that shows that in 1942, the Roosevelt administration seized the bank owned by Prescott Bush.
[01:12:39.771 --> 01:12:40.652]  Brown Brother Harriman, yeah.
[01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:43.397]  Those documents, of course, were cut.
[01:12:44.224 --> 01:12:51.066]  Now, however, if one wants to go find those documents anew, why, they're kept in an archive that is no longer public.
[01:12:51.066 --> 01:12:53.026]  But the London Guardian got them before then.
[01:12:53.026 --> 01:12:54.887]  Of course, we helped break that in 2004.
[01:12:54.887 --> 01:12:56.167]  The Guardian covered in 2005.
[01:12:56.167 --> 01:12:58.247]  I'm proud of that fact.
[01:12:58.247 --> 01:13:03.529]  Mr. Stone, StoneZone.com, thank you so much for breaking all this huge news with InfoWars.
[01:13:03.529 --> 01:13:07.590]  And it's a great place, obviously, to help get it out to a wide audience of patriots.
[01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:11.951]  And so please continue to break major news here throughout the weeks and months to come.
[01:13:11.951 --> 01:13:13.491]  This is definitely an edge of our seat.
[01:13:14.071 --> 01:13:15.192]  Epic election cycle.
[01:13:15.192 --> 01:13:16.913]  The greatest I've ever seen in my life.
[01:13:16.913 --> 01:13:18.995]  Thank you, Roger Stone.
[01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:19.955]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:13:19.955 --> 01:13:20.576]  You're a patriot.
[01:13:20.576 --> 01:13:21.937]  Thanks for everything you do for the country.
[01:13:21.937 --> 01:13:27.281]  In the meantime, if you like this video, retweet it with the hashtag Tricky Ted.
[01:13:27.281 --> 01:13:27.821]  Many thanks.
[01:13:28.157 --> 01:13:29.978]  All right, thank you so much.
[01:13:29.978 --> 01:13:38.524]  Wow, Richard Reeves, we're about to go to break, but I tell you, to be inside these meetings, you've been there with all the stuff coming out, and it's hard to just sit back and be quiet about it.
[01:13:38.524 --> 01:13:42.346]  Sessions will be endorsing him on this day, and just to see it all happen.
[01:13:42.346 --> 01:13:44.567]  I mean, Stone is a dynamo.
[01:13:44.567 --> 01:13:46.929]  This guy's, you know, 65, 66 years old.
[01:13:46.929 --> 01:13:48.330]  He's got more energy than I do.
[01:13:48.330 --> 01:13:52.372]  At 11 o'clock at night, you know, he's already been on air all day long.
[01:13:52.372 --> 01:13:56.255]  Really exciting to be in the middle of this and be fighting for America, Richard.
[01:13:56.835 --> 01:13:59.559]  Well, at some point in the near future, I'm sure we're going to see.
[01:13:59.559 --> 01:14:10.114]  We're going to see Donald Trump, Roger Stone, and yourself, three human dynamos that probably sleep three or four hours each a night, and you're going until, you know, you wake up at 4 or 5 a.m.
[01:14:10.114 --> 01:14:11.957]  and go to work, and you work all day until...
[01:14:12.918 --> 01:14:17.680]  Two or three AM, so it's crazy to see you guys all working so hard.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:40.772]  But as a matter of fact, one thing you just mentioned about the Jeff Sessions situation, right as you guys were interviewing, right just now live when you guys, Roger and yourself, were on the radio right now interviewing, Jeff Sessions came out and spoke at the Madison, Alabama event with Donald Trump, and he put the hat on, Make America Great, so that endorsement with Jeff Sessions just happened, so that was really powerful to see.
[01:14:41.616 --> 01:14:44.077]  Well, I tell you, this is the attempt to take down of the country.
[01:14:44.077 --> 01:14:48.738]  And the power structure, you know, hasn't been perfect, but a really evil one is taking over right now.
[01:14:48.738 --> 01:14:52.199]  We're going to break and come back with Richard just about what's happening in the election.
[01:14:52.199 --> 01:14:54.479]  We're also going to open the phones up and take your calls.
[01:14:54.479 --> 01:14:56.240]  I'm not really promoting this like I should.
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:59.120]  We've never had a sale in my 21 years on air like this.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:05.002]  We fund our operations selling high quality products, books, films, water filters, non-GMO seeds, Patriot apparel.
[01:15:05.962 --> 01:15:08.324]  It's expanded over the years as the operation has expanded.
[01:15:08.324 --> 01:15:09.625]  Nutraceuticals, you name it.
[01:15:09.625 --> 01:15:13.308]  Everything at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:20.513]  All the products are 30% off on top of discounts that are already there and free shipping.
[01:15:20.513 --> 01:15:22.995]  You cannot beat that deal.
[01:15:22.995 --> 01:15:25.057]  That's free shipping on orders of more than $50, but it's 30% off.
[01:15:27.688 --> 01:15:28.769]  On everything.
[01:15:28.769 --> 01:15:29.730]  On top of the discounts.
[01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:31.171]  It is the leap year sale.
[01:15:31.171 --> 01:15:33.833]  And it only goes until tomorrow at midnight.
[01:15:33.833 --> 01:15:36.495]  I'm going to end it tomorrow at midnight.
[01:15:36.495 --> 01:15:40.098]  But this is how we help have reporters on the field and do all this and look at us.
[01:15:40.098 --> 01:15:41.939]  I mean, I'm working seven days a week.
[01:15:41.939 --> 01:15:43.120]  We're shooting videos at midnight.
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:44.441]  We're doing live stuff at 7 a.m.
[01:15:44.441 --> 01:15:45.122]  in the morning.
[01:15:45.122 --> 01:15:46.102]  And I'm not complaining.
[01:15:46.102 --> 01:15:47.904]  This is the Animating Contest of Liberty.
[01:15:47.904 --> 01:15:49.205]  History is being made right now.
[01:15:49.205 --> 01:15:50.086]  You better believe.
[01:15:50.966 --> 01:15:55.368]  I mean, quite frankly, I want to work 8 days a week, 9 days a week, 10 days a week.
[01:15:55.368 --> 01:15:57.609]  And under the new Common Core, I can't do this 9 days a week.
[01:15:57.609 --> 01:16:01.511]  You got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[01:16:01.511 --> 01:16:06.273]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:16:06.273 --> 01:16:07.274]  Talk about the effects.
[01:16:07.614 --> 01:16:09.116]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:16:09.116 --> 01:16:11.038]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:16:11.038 --> 01:16:12.159]  I feel like I look better.
[01:16:12.159 --> 01:16:12.860]  I feel better.
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:14.282]  I feel sexier.
[01:16:14.282 --> 01:16:14.903]  I love it.
[01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:17.886]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[01:16:17.886 --> 01:16:20.829]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[01:16:20.829 --> 01:16:21.891]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:16:21.891 --> 01:16:22.912]  Consult your physician.
[01:16:23.072 --> 01:16:25.433]  Visit Infowarslife.com today.
[01:16:25.433 --> 01:16:26.714]  This is life-changing.
[01:16:26.714 --> 01:16:27.635]  Shower filters.
[01:16:27.635 --> 01:16:29.356]  We're introducing the best yet.
[01:16:29.356 --> 01:16:33.418]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[01:16:33.418 --> 01:16:38.240]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:45.324]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[01:16:45.324 --> 01:16:48.146]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free shipping
[01:16:48.406 --> 01:16:52.487]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula.
[01:17:05.911 --> 01:17:09.415]  That was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:17:09.415 --> 01:17:12.098]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:17:12.098 --> 01:17:15.662]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:17:15.662 --> 01:17:21.989]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[01:17:21.989 --> 01:17:26.834]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:17:27.114 --> 01:17:33.496]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:17:33.496 --> 01:17:41.238]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:17:41.238 --> 01:17:48.781]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:17:52.382 --> 01:17:55.343]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:17:57.992 --> 01:18:05.715]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here to announce the biggest single sale in InfoWars 21-year history.

[01:18:43.802 --> 01:18:54.330]  And finally, from yours truly, Alex Jones, to all the patriots of every race, color, and creed across this country and the world, I salute you for your tireless fight against tyranny and your support of the Infowar.
[01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:56.212]  Without you, none of this is possible.
[01:18:56.852 --> 01:18:57.672]  Hey, everyone.
[01:18:57.672 --> 01:18:59.973]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:18:59.973 --> 01:19:03.813]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:19:03.813 --> 01:19:05.894]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:19:05.894 --> 01:19:16.156]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:19:16.156 --> 01:19:22.137]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:19:22.617 --> 01:19:37.534]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[01:19:37.534 --> 01:19:39.075]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:08.943 --> 01:20:14.968]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[01:20:14.968 --> 01:20:19.491]  Government is the problem.
[01:20:19.491 --> 01:20:27.197]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[01:20:27.197 --> 01:20:34.322]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[01:20:35.245 --> 01:20:37.386]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:37.386 --> 01:20:39.328]  Because there is a war on.
[01:20:39.328 --> 01:20:41.869]  For your mind.
[01:20:41.869 --> 01:20:43.650]  Alright, folks.
[01:20:43.650 --> 01:20:49.794]  Every time I walk back to the coffee room or the control room, every office in the building has a different TV channel on.
[01:20:51.272 --> 01:20:57.838]  C-SPAN, Fox, CNN, MSNBC, we have our own feeds up for our radio show and TV show, The Nightly News.
[01:20:57.838 --> 01:20:59.279]  So we're keeping track of things.
[01:20:59.279 --> 01:21:00.801]  It's like gauges.
[01:21:00.801 --> 01:21:02.983]  And it's anti-Donald Trump ads.
[01:21:02.983 --> 01:21:09.309]  Notice how he won't spend any money with the horror media, but all the other big candidates and the Koch brothers, it's just everywhere.
[01:21:09.309 --> 01:21:13.573]  He had a hotel construction site that had a couple of illegals working at it.
[01:21:14.033 --> 01:21:23.102]  And then the company he hired to do it didn't vet them properly, as if this guy with tens of thousands of employees and construction sites all over the world knows everything that's going on.
[01:21:23.102 --> 01:21:31.430]  He's saying he won't deport people, he will not give them all these freebies, he will not order the Border Patrol to stand down.
[01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:33.151]  That's what matters is what he stands for, not
[01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:39.633]  I mean, I'll tell you, I sit there and try to not hire illegals, not because I'm against them, but just because it's hypocritical.
[01:21:39.633 --> 01:21:42.335]  And it is hard to do, you know, for any type of service stuff.
[01:21:42.335 --> 01:21:44.496]  What, do you sit there and check everybody's papers?
[01:21:44.496 --> 01:21:47.418]  That's why we have to control the border itself and also what businesses are doing.
[01:21:47.418 --> 01:21:49.319]  But they play these games.
[01:21:49.319 --> 01:21:51.360]  You can see the whole power structure against Donald Trump.
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:55.263]  And now they're saying, well, decry the KKK.
[01:21:55.263 --> 01:21:56.084]  And he's like, what?
[01:21:56.084 --> 01:21:59.586]  And people like David Duke.
[01:22:01.345 --> 01:22:09.953]  I mean this is just truly sickening that they play this political correctness game all day when Mecha and La Raza and other groups are just like the Klan and that's their own government's funding.
[01:22:09.953 --> 01:22:11.915]  Richard Reeves, what other attacks do you expect to see?
[01:22:12.691 --> 01:22:13.912]  Well, it's endless.
[01:22:13.912 --> 01:22:31.647]  I mean, just like this issue about employing illegal immigrants, if you go to practically any full-service restaurant, you could be accused of, oh, well, I'm aiding and abetting illegal immigration because you're sitting there, the busboy at the restaurant is an illegal immigrant, an illegal alien.
[01:22:31.647 --> 01:22:35.550]  You know, a lot of people in the kitchen saying... Well, I'm not against them even as people!
[01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:40.674]  It's like globalists are bringing them in to politically turn them into socialists and then letting them vote to take my guns!
[01:22:40.894 --> 01:22:41.755]  No, exactly.
[01:22:41.755 --> 01:22:45.898]  And I think Donald Trump will absolutely be the number one guy to address that.
[01:22:45.898 --> 01:22:48.981]  I think he's the candidate to address that where he'll finally straighten it out.
[01:22:48.981 --> 01:22:50.482]  What do you make of the bombshells dropped?
[01:22:50.482 --> 01:22:58.528]  You were there at the meetings that he's going around to Trump, he's going around to Rubio saying I'll drop out if you promise to nominate me to the Supreme Court.
[01:22:58.528 --> 01:22:59.809]  That's unprecedented.
[01:22:59.809 --> 01:23:00.930]  Stone believes it's illegal.
[01:23:00.930 --> 01:23:02.191]  That is huge.
[01:23:02.191 --> 01:23:08.496]  The fact that the bigger bombshell that he was even dropping before that where you've got
[01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:12.206]  The whole Koch brothers coming after Trump?
[01:23:12.206 --> 01:23:14.787]  I mean, if that is an endorsement of Trump, what is?
[01:23:14.787 --> 01:23:15.107]  Right.
[01:23:15.107 --> 01:23:27.031]  Well, in the case of this deal with Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio potentially talking about that, oh, if I'll drop out of the race, that Cruz would drop out of the race if Marco agrees in the future to appoint him for the Supreme Court.
[01:23:27.031 --> 01:23:34.994]  I think maybe those bus fumes from Ted's bus are coming up into the cabin of the bus, because I think it's a totally bad plan for Ted, because for one thing,
[01:23:35.814 --> 01:23:39.055]  Ted can endorse Marco Rubio all day, every day.
[01:23:39.055 --> 01:23:42.117]  Those people that follow Ted Cruz are not going to go to Marco Rubio.
[01:23:42.117 --> 01:23:44.077]  They're going to go to Donald Trump.
[01:23:44.077 --> 01:23:45.318]  They are not going to Marco Rubio.
[01:23:45.318 --> 01:23:47.939]  And notice they kept saying as other people drop out, Trump will get weaker.
[01:23:47.939 --> 01:23:50.700]  No, he gets almost everybody, including the Jeb people.
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:51.901]  Right, exactly.
[01:23:51.901 --> 01:23:53.621]  And what a shocker that is.
[01:23:53.621 --> 01:23:55.202]  I wouldn't have even expected.
[01:23:55.202 --> 01:24:01.244]  There is a portion of the Jeb votership that has gone to Donald Trump, without a doubt.
[01:24:01.244 --> 01:24:05.086]  But for people from Ted Cruz's camp to go to Marco Rubio,
[01:24:05.726 --> 01:24:08.308]  That, in my view, I've been to a lot of these events.
[01:24:08.308 --> 01:24:09.229]  That's a non-starter.
[01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:10.510]  That's not going to happen.
[01:24:10.510 --> 01:24:20.617]  Those folks, if and when Ted Cruz does drop out, which I think will be happening within the next month or two, that population of voters is coming to Donald Trump.
[01:24:20.617 --> 01:24:21.558]  Well, here's the bigger question.
[01:24:21.558 --> 01:24:24.220]  I'm going to play this coming up before calls.
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:25.100]  What are they going to do?
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:27.182]  I mean, they've got the New York Times calling for killing him.
[01:24:27.182 --> 01:24:29.844]  We've got a video of Democrats in Austin saying, let's kill him immediately.
[01:24:31.087 --> 01:24:32.228]  These people aren't liberals.
[01:24:32.228 --> 01:24:34.791]  These are like, and they're all soft and weak too.
[01:24:34.791 --> 01:24:38.375]  I always love how these nobodies, that can't even fist fight, want to kill people.
[01:24:39.902 --> 01:24:41.663]  It's just so ridiculous.
[01:24:41.663 --> 01:24:47.868]  Well, it's crazy and I think ultimately Donald Trump has great security around him, people around him that he's had for years.
[01:24:47.868 --> 01:24:49.769]  Sure, it just shows what trash these people are.
[01:24:49.769 --> 01:24:51.170]  No, exactly, exactly.
[01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:57.734]  And they can talk about all they want, but ultimately I think that actually Donald Trump has angels protecting him, ultimately, and he's going to need them.
[01:24:57.734 --> 01:25:02.818]  But yeah, this situation with Ted Cruz, Supreme Court talk, I don't know.
[01:25:02.818 --> 01:25:04.519]  They've been on the campaign trail a long time.
[01:25:04.519 --> 01:25:05.620]  I think that's one of the reasons
[01:25:06.616 --> 01:25:17.340]  That they had this breakdown in this last debate where they got into the talk like they're in kindergarten or in elementary school or whatever.
[01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:21.701]  I think that's why they got down there because these guys are kind of punch drunk from being out there on the campaign trail.
[01:25:21.701 --> 01:25:23.562]  It is grueling, grueling hard work.
[01:25:23.962 --> 01:25:32.454]  I can't say what Stone said that Trump's been telling him, but Trump literally is the son of German immigrants who isn't part of political correctness and isn't into all this.
[01:25:32.454 --> 01:25:34.317]  That's why he hears this stuff and goes, what?
[01:25:34.317 --> 01:25:34.658]  What?
[01:25:34.658 --> 01:25:38.083]  He literally doesn't even know about all this stuff.
[01:25:38.083 --> 01:25:39.945]  He just grew up in New York and isn't even part of it.
[01:25:40.626 --> 01:25:42.468]  He literally is like, what are you talking about?
[01:25:42.468 --> 01:25:43.509]  I grew up in New York, around everybody.
[01:25:43.509 --> 01:25:44.690]  I used to get along with everybody.
[01:25:44.690 --> 01:25:45.630]  You know?
[01:25:45.630 --> 01:25:45.911]  What?
[01:25:45.911 --> 01:25:46.251]  What?
[01:25:46.251 --> 01:25:46.851]  What?
[01:25:46.851 --> 01:25:47.312]  That's it.
[01:25:47.312 --> 01:25:56.760]  And we expect, by the way, that just reminds me of how big a show we're having tomorrow, because all this stuff that's come up about, you know, the racism, the bigotry, the sexism, and all that.
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:00.143]  Tomorrow, on tomorrow's show, we're going to talk about that and get a lot of that out.
[01:26:00.143 --> 01:26:03.746]  And we had this set up weeks ago with the, what is it, Diamonds and Lace?
[01:26:03.746 --> 01:26:05.327]  Diamond and Silk, tomorrow.
[01:26:05.327 --> 01:26:07.449]  Diamond and Silk, and then we also got the Peruvian Lady and all that.
[01:26:07.489 --> 01:26:09.611]  We've got the Colombian lady, Miriam Whitcher.
[01:26:09.611 --> 01:26:11.793]  A bunch of other people from all over the world coming on.
[01:26:11.793 --> 01:26:16.298]  And we have that set up just because they're fun and interesting to talk to, not because, hey, look, he's not a racist.
[01:26:16.298 --> 01:26:18.760]  I'm just sick of having to say, I'm not a racist.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:23.405]  I've had the media ask me countless times, what do you think of David Dick?
[01:26:23.405 --> 01:26:27.149]  And I'm like, go look at what the Nazis and white supremacists say about me online.
[01:26:27.149 --> 01:26:28.930]  I am more hated than Benjamin Netanyahu.
[01:26:29.711 --> 01:26:33.616]  And it's just because I'm one of the main leaders of the Liberty Movement and I want to be inclusive.
[01:26:33.616 --> 01:26:36.840]  And they're like, no, we're not going to include Mexicans and black people.
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:42.026]  Right, well, normally... Then I'm against anybody joining the Socialists or La Raza and other racist groups.
[01:26:42.026 --> 01:26:43.708]  Like, I don't like the white supremacists.
[01:26:43.708 --> 01:26:46.651]  I don't like the Mexican supremacists, the new Black Panther Party.
[01:26:46.651 --> 01:26:47.552]  I hate all these people.
[01:26:47.552 --> 01:26:48.253]  I'm sick of them.
[01:26:48.393 --> 01:26:51.095]  Racists and ultimate racists, I think, are the Democrat Party.
[01:26:51.095 --> 01:26:52.335]  That's all they do is race bait!
[01:26:52.335 --> 01:26:59.440]  Yeah, they only race bait and they're the ones... He ought to come out, that's Trump's angle, just come out and say, you're the party of the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:00.280]  Right.
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:09.545]  And on top of that, they're the ones that say, oh, well, without us in the government to be your mama and daddy, without us giving you the handouts, then you can't fend for yourself.
[01:27:09.545 --> 01:27:10.846]  You can't create your own business.
[01:27:10.846 --> 01:27:12.547]  You can't get a good job.
[01:27:12.547 --> 01:27:13.588]  You can't make your own living.
[01:27:14.028 --> 01:27:15.069]  Talk about racism.
[01:27:15.069 --> 01:27:19.573]  I mean, that's the biggest put-down there is, is you've got to stay in the Democrat Party so we can keep you on the plantation.
[01:27:19.573 --> 01:27:20.814]  And we're going to take care of you.
[01:27:20.814 --> 01:27:29.021]  But I mean, I would just, if I was Trump, when he responds, I'd just go, no, I don't support the Grand Dragon, David Duke, or the former leader of the Senate, Robert Byrd, the Grand Dragon.
[01:27:29.021 --> 01:27:29.181]  Right.
[01:27:29.181 --> 01:27:30.782]  Well, the Supreme Grand Dragon.
[01:27:30.782 --> 01:27:33.565]  I mean, he ran the, what's the head guy over a dragon?
[01:27:33.565 --> 01:27:34.546]  He was the leader of the whole country.
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:41.886]  Well, I don't know what that guy's title was, but in the case of Byrd's case... He had all these dumb names like Cyclops, Dumb Dumb, and Dumbass.
[01:27:41.886 --> 01:27:46.591]  And Byrd was one of the top operatives of the Democrat Party for how many years?
[01:27:46.591 --> 01:27:49.894]  So, that's the ultimate racist group.
[01:27:49.894 --> 01:27:51.235]  I am just so sick of it, man.
[01:27:51.235 --> 01:27:53.618]  I am so sick of all this crap.
[01:27:53.618 --> 01:28:00.304]  Speaking of Democrats, while we're talking about it, let me kind of segue a little bit into what I think happened in South Carolina yesterday on the big primary for the Democrats.
[01:28:00.404 --> 01:28:00.744]  Stay there.
[01:28:00.744 --> 01:28:01.705]  I want to talk to you.
[01:28:01.705 --> 01:28:03.726]  We're going to take calls, too, and play this report.
[01:28:03.726 --> 01:28:07.808]  But I want to take some calls specifically on Trump, specifically on the bombshells we've been dropping here.
[01:28:07.808 --> 01:28:22.035]  What do viewers and listeners think about Trump coming out and basically just blasting vaccines, blasting the U.N., blasting 9-11 as an inside job, just China coming after him, the Mexican president, former president coming after him.
[01:28:22.035 --> 01:28:24.216]  Here's the toll-free number of first-time callers.
[01:28:24.216 --> 01:28:26.277]  All I ask is you have a good phone and not be too drunk.
[01:28:26.277 --> 01:28:26.637]  877-789-2539. 877.
[01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:34.662]  789-ALEX-877-789-2539.
[01:28:34.662 --> 01:28:38.305]  And don't forget, we're running a one-time, first-time, never done it before.
[01:28:38.305 --> 01:28:41.467]  We'll probably do it in four years if we haven't had a nuclear warrant or so here.
[01:28:41.467 --> 01:28:55.337]  We've got 30% off and the discounts still in place and free shipping at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com right now on the nutraceuticals, on the water filters, on the Hillary for Prison shirts.
[01:28:58.226 --> 01:29:04.972]  Someone on Twitter asks, Hey, if you're so against the left-right paradigm, then why do you only talk about the Republican candidates and not Bernie Sanders?
[01:29:04.972 --> 01:29:08.655]  Listen, the Sanders tax plan will destroy the middle class.
[01:29:08.655 --> 01:29:11.837]  You've got to loot the middle class because that's where the money is.
[01:29:11.837 --> 01:29:18.583]  According to the Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation, the Sanders tax plan will raise taxes on most Americans.
[01:29:18.783 --> 01:29:23.444]  It's a very big tax increase for everyone, except those at the bottom.
[01:29:23.444 --> 01:29:31.325]  Everybody loves to get free stuff, and politicians are always pitching the idea that the poor and middle class are going to get the benefits, and the rich will pay for it.
[01:29:31.325 --> 01:29:36.426]  Americans received more than $2 trillion in benefits from the federal government in 2014.
[01:29:36.426 --> 01:29:39.707]  Bernie wants to hike that amount exponentially.
[01:29:39.707 --> 01:29:46.648]  The question is, where's the money going to come from after the middle class and the millionaires have been looted, and the mega-rich flee the country?
[01:29:47.128 --> 01:29:52.583]  To find out in detail how the Sanders tax plan will destroy the middle class, visit InfoWars.com.

[01:33:20.955 --> 01:33:21.876]  Six days a week live.
[01:33:26.972 --> 01:33:28.672]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:28.672 --> 01:33:30.313]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:30.313 --> 01:33:35.794]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.794 --> 01:33:37.555]  Alright, I want to go to your phone calls.
[01:33:37.555 --> 01:33:38.315]  I want to cover news.
[01:33:38.315 --> 01:33:40.035]  I want to get to this report.
[01:33:40.035 --> 01:33:42.276]  I got a Liam McAdam report, too, that's excellent.
[01:33:42.276 --> 01:33:42.976]  We got a Joe Biggs report.
[01:33:42.976 --> 01:33:44.136]  He goes out and talks to Austin Heights.
[01:33:44.136 --> 01:33:46.817]  A lot of them want to kill Donald Trump.
[01:33:46.817 --> 01:33:50.258]  Of course, they couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag, but they're killers.
[01:33:53.198 --> 01:33:55.640]  Other points you were going to make, Richard, before we take a few calls?
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:34:00.522]  Well, one of the things I wanted to briefly mention is about the South Carolina primary that the Democrats had.
[01:34:00.522 --> 01:34:09.727]  One of my theories about what happened there, that Hillary had just such a big, insurmountable victory over Bernie, is that the Republicans had their primary a week before.
[01:34:10.327 --> 01:34:17.774]  And there's so much excitement regarding the Republican primaries that I think would-be Bernie voters said, you know what, they can't wait.
[01:34:17.774 --> 01:34:20.376]  It sucks the oxygen out of the room.
[01:34:20.376 --> 01:34:21.257]  Right.
[01:34:21.257 --> 01:34:23.919]  They literally went and got involved in the Republican primary.
[01:34:23.919 --> 01:34:25.300]  They didn't want to wait.
[01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:27.442]  By the way, it's admitted a lot of Democrats are going for Donald.
[01:34:27.722 --> 01:34:31.745]  And that's why I'm thinking, you know what, and I've said it before, I'm going to say it again.
[01:34:31.745 --> 01:34:42.654]  Democrat establishment, just go ahead and force-feed Hillary down the throats of the Democrat Party, because I think a lot of those Bernie supporters are going to come Trump's way when he's the nominee.
[01:34:42.674 --> 01:34:51.000]  Well I'll say this, there's a lot of good people supporting Sanders, and I've probably been too mean to him, but I know how bad socialism is, but some of them are just helpless and want something free.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.842]  That's not how the world works.
[01:34:52.842 --> 01:35:02.949]  But he is obviously better than Hillary, and the way they're stealing it from him, where he wins New Hampshire and they take the delegates, or she wins six coin tosses in a row, that has really got them angry against the system.
[01:35:02.949 --> 01:35:06.872]  So I want to say bravo to the Sanders people for at least getting the fact you're getting screwed.
[01:35:06.872 --> 01:35:08.454]  You're better than Hillary supporters.
[01:35:08.454 --> 01:35:09.795]  What is wrong with those people?
[01:35:10.595 --> 01:35:12.617]  They're totally sheeple and totally out of their minds.
[01:35:12.617 --> 01:35:14.238]  I've been to some of those rallies.
[01:35:14.238 --> 01:35:19.642]  It's incredible to look at those folks in the eyes and watch them how they behave and how they're just sheeple-like.
[01:35:19.642 --> 01:35:21.243]  You've described it to a tee.
[01:35:21.243 --> 01:35:22.885]  You said they're total sheeple.
[01:35:22.885 --> 01:35:24.346]  That's exactly the right description.
[01:35:24.346 --> 01:35:26.808]  You go in there and just keep waiting for them to start bleeding.
[01:35:32.250 --> 01:35:34.512]  It's unbelievable, and that's exactly what the case is.
[01:35:34.512 --> 01:35:37.233]  So anyway, that's my take on what happened with South Carolina.
[01:35:37.233 --> 01:35:42.996]  That's why Hillary just won so overwhelmingly, because I think... Well, plus they also see she's just gonna steal it now.
[01:35:42.996 --> 01:35:43.496]  Right.
[01:35:43.496 --> 01:35:45.317]  She's just gonna steal it across the whole country.
[01:35:45.757 --> 01:35:47.998]  Yep, she's going to steal it, so that's fine.
[01:35:47.998 --> 01:35:57.980]  But I do see the black leadership coming out for her, and when she literally has made comments like, we mean to make blacks heal like dogs, they are super predators, that's like David Duke stuff.
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:00.301]  Why isn't he endorsing her?
[01:36:00.301 --> 01:36:00.961]  He should be.
[01:36:00.961 --> 01:36:08.283]  I mean, that's the real party right there of the people that discriminate, the real racism is the Democrat Party, as we talked about just a little while ago.
[01:36:08.283 --> 01:36:10.344]  But yes, I mean, Hillary
[01:36:11.144 --> 01:36:26.661]  She is going to pay absolutely no attention to the African-American population of this country after she becomes the nominee, then she's just going to discard them just like, you know, she discarded the folks in Benghazi there at the council, you know, when they got...
[01:36:27.182 --> 01:36:28.444]  Killed by the terrorist attack.
[01:36:44.619 --> 01:36:46.540]  We've got a lot of callers here.
[01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:50.281]  Maybe I should go to somebody that disagrees first.
[01:36:50.281 --> 01:36:51.702]  Who is it that disagrees?
[01:36:51.702 --> 01:36:52.442]  Frank?
[01:36:52.442 --> 01:36:55.083]  I'd like to go to them first when they do call in.
[01:36:55.083 --> 01:36:56.144]  Frank in North Carolina.
[01:36:56.144 --> 01:36:56.704]  You're on the air.
[01:36:56.704 --> 01:36:58.425]  Go ahead.
[01:36:58.425 --> 01:36:59.325]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:36:59.325 --> 01:37:01.906]  I was honest with your call screener.
[01:37:01.906 --> 01:37:02.066]  Sure.
[01:37:02.066 --> 01:37:04.007]  We don't have to do any call screen deal.
[01:37:04.007 --> 01:37:04.427]  You're on air.
[01:37:04.427 --> 01:37:06.188]  Go ahead.
[01:37:06.188 --> 01:37:09.669]  I'm calling in to speak out against political correctness and the double standard.
[01:37:12.571 --> 01:37:17.221]  Maybe it's not a good thing strategically, David Duke coming out for Donald Trump, but
[01:37:18.335 --> 01:37:24.117]  He's been fighting against the takedown of America since before you and I were born, and I don't worship David Duke.
[01:37:24.117 --> 01:37:28.138]  I've been accused of worshipping you for many years.
[01:37:28.138 --> 01:37:41.382]  I just, I don't know why we have to throw David Duke under the bus and kind of embellish and make up things and bring up, you know, that he was in the KKK back in the 1960s when he was like 17 or 18 years old.
[01:37:41.382 --> 01:37:44.803]  He was never affiliated with any violence or intimidation.
[01:37:44.803 --> 01:37:46.024]  Listen, listen, listen.
[01:37:46.904 --> 01:37:51.047]  Mecha and La Raza are more racist than the Klan and are despicable groups.
[01:37:51.047 --> 01:37:51.908]  There's not a double standard.
[01:37:51.908 --> 01:37:53.649]  I attacked them all day long.
[01:37:53.649 --> 01:37:55.150]  And he was in the Klan a lot longer than that.
[01:37:55.150 --> 01:37:59.092]  But look, I think he is a more well-spoken person.
[01:37:59.092 --> 01:38:02.935]  He makes a lot of great points about America being destroyed, the borders being opened.
[01:38:02.935 --> 01:38:03.675]  That's all true.
[01:38:03.675 --> 01:38:11.841]  But the thing is, then he goes on and says stuff about black people and everybody else that isn't inclusive and is what the globalists want is divide and conquer.
[01:38:11.841 --> 01:38:14.623]  So broken clocks are right twice a day, but
[01:38:15.939 --> 01:38:19.763]  I mean, David Duke could not be trying to give the establishment a bigger president.
[01:38:19.763 --> 01:38:20.563]  Now, is he a Fed?
[01:38:20.563 --> 01:38:21.204]  Probably not.
[01:38:21.204 --> 01:38:24.367]  But a lot of these white supremacist groups and organizations are.
[01:38:24.367 --> 01:38:25.988]  I get he's a white nationalist.
[01:38:25.988 --> 01:38:27.850]  You know, he's quote, grown.
[01:38:27.850 --> 01:38:31.133]  We've got Louis Farrakhan out saying Hillary's a devil.
[01:38:31.133 --> 01:38:31.834]  Don't trust her.
[01:38:31.834 --> 01:38:32.514]  You know, all this stuff.
[01:38:32.514 --> 01:38:35.317]  We have that video up on InfoWars.com.
[01:38:35.317 --> 01:38:37.139]  So I get people change.
[01:38:37.139 --> 01:38:39.701]  I don't want to make this election a referendum on David Duke.
[01:38:39.701 --> 01:38:40.462]  And I got 30 seconds.
[01:38:42.944 --> 01:38:43.304]  I don't know.
[01:38:59.261 --> 01:39:06.507]  When you say those people, are there some Talmudic groups and some sects that think everybody else are animals and they're, you know, God and all this stuff?
[01:39:06.507 --> 01:39:07.448]  Every group has those groups.
[01:39:07.448 --> 01:39:09.850]  I always hear the Jews like it's one group.
[01:39:09.850 --> 01:39:15.434]  I mean, Israel's got like 10 different political parties, so I just, I mean, I've grown up my whole life knowing a bunch of different Jews.
[01:39:15.434 --> 01:39:16.395]  They're different people.
[01:39:16.395 --> 01:39:17.256]  They're people like everybody else.
[01:39:17.256 --> 01:39:24.962]  That's why I don't get into race or religion and make it about any one group, except maybe Islam, where the dominant group in that now is a bunch of head-chopping loons.
[01:39:24.962 --> 01:39:26.744]  But listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:39:27.344 --> 01:39:32.250]  I just, I'm so sick of like, the media has always asked me, well what do you think of white supremacism?
[01:39:32.250 --> 01:39:35.353]  They talk about a new world order because the president talks about it.
[01:39:35.353 --> 01:39:38.177]  You know, I'm just really tired of it.
[01:39:38.177 --> 01:39:39.658]  I want to go to this special report.
[01:39:39.658 --> 01:39:42.241]  We're going to go to break and come back with your phone calls.
[01:39:42.241 --> 01:39:46.887]  But don't forget, we're running the biggest sale in InfoWars history at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:39:57.185 --> 01:40:02.228]  Here's what the Democrats, talk about racists, talk about haters, salivating over the death of Donald Trump.
[01:40:02.228 --> 01:40:04.669]  Here it is in Austin, Texas.
[01:40:04.669 --> 01:40:06.831]  Hey there, Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[01:40:06.831 --> 01:40:09.492]  We're at the University of Texas in Austin.
[01:40:09.492 --> 01:40:12.935]  Home of some of the most brilliantly minded people known to man.
[01:40:12.935 --> 01:40:14.215]  What's the second amendment again?
[01:40:14.215 --> 01:40:15.136]  The right to bear arms?
[01:40:15.136 --> 01:40:15.736]  Okay, yeah.
[01:40:15.736 --> 01:40:16.737]  Is that the gun control one?
[01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:19.871]  I'm from Mexico, so I don't know.
[01:40:19.871 --> 01:40:25.593]  I'm not familiar with the historical connotations of Black Friday.
[01:40:25.593 --> 01:40:26.614]  I guess so.
[01:40:26.614 --> 01:40:30.776]  Do you know what the Declaration of Independence is?
[01:40:30.776 --> 01:40:32.496]  Who was the president?
[01:40:32.496 --> 01:40:33.977]  That, I knew, and I... wait.
[01:40:33.977 --> 01:40:34.897]  Bernie Sanders!
[01:40:34.897 --> 01:40:36.018]  Donald Trump is?
[01:40:41.223 --> 01:40:43.063]  What planet are you on?
[01:40:43.063 --> 01:40:45.964]  Are you going to school here?
[01:40:45.964 --> 01:40:48.545]  You don't know who Donald Trump is?
[01:40:48.545 --> 01:40:50.525]  This is, this is, this is, this is the Democrats people.
[01:40:50.525 --> 01:40:53.526]  Well there you have it, some interesting people to say the least.
[01:40:53.526 --> 01:41:02.128]  Now we're going to give you, the college student that represents America, an opportunity to look into the camera and tell the presidential frontrunners exactly how you feel.
[01:41:02.128 --> 01:41:03.009]  Hey what's going on man?
[01:41:03.009 --> 01:41:03.729]  Puppies or kittens?
[01:41:04.349 --> 01:41:05.130]  Puppies.
[01:41:05.130 --> 01:41:06.471]  Puppies, for sure.
[01:41:06.471 --> 01:41:07.432]  Puppies, for sure.
[01:41:07.432 --> 01:41:08.673]  Why puppies?
[01:41:08.673 --> 01:41:09.914]  Because I'm a dog guy.
[01:41:09.914 --> 01:41:13.096]  I tricked you with that puppies and kitten thing to get you in here, alright?
[01:41:13.096 --> 01:41:13.257]  Yeah.
[01:41:13.257 --> 01:41:16.359]  If you could tell Donald Trump anything right now, what would it be?
[01:41:16.359 --> 01:41:18.641]  I would say, shut up.
[01:41:18.641 --> 01:41:19.242]  That's it?
[01:41:19.242 --> 01:41:19.882]  Yeah.
[01:41:19.882 --> 01:41:21.103]  I think he's a racist.
[01:41:21.103 --> 01:41:22.764]  I think he's a self-centered pig.
[01:41:22.764 --> 01:41:24.086]  Go away!
[01:41:24.086 --> 01:41:25.307]  He's stupid.
[01:41:25.307 --> 01:41:25.607]  Stupid!
[01:41:25.607 --> 01:41:26.628]  He's a racist.
[01:41:27.168 --> 01:41:27.929]  Stop being racist.
[01:41:27.929 --> 01:41:31.755]  Donald Trump, you're the most real guy in politics right now.
[01:41:31.755 --> 01:41:33.797]  I feel like you're the only one I can trust.
[01:41:33.797 --> 01:41:34.739]  You got my vote.
[01:41:34.739 --> 01:41:39.666]  I've followed him, and I've listened to him, and every time you see a still shot of him, it looks like it's the lights that are down.
[01:41:41.340 --> 01:41:43.042]  The few smart people are actually not white.
[01:41:43.042 --> 01:41:44.483]  Like that guy looks like he's Hispanic.
[01:41:44.483 --> 01:41:46.224]  What the f*** is wrong with you, man?
[01:41:46.224 --> 01:41:47.064]  There's an idiot racist.
[01:41:47.064 --> 01:41:47.324]  That's it?
[01:41:47.324 --> 01:41:48.785]  Yeah, that's all I got.
[01:41:48.785 --> 01:41:50.767]  You should be nicer to people.
[01:41:50.767 --> 01:41:52.628]  He can go f*** himself pretty much.
[01:41:52.628 --> 01:41:54.809]  I'm waiting for him to get assassinated, really.
[01:41:54.809 --> 01:41:57.671]  I hope somebody pulls the trigger on him because we need something better than that.
[01:41:57.671 --> 01:41:59.753]  Just gotta make sure I don't get shot.
[01:41:59.753 --> 01:42:00.693]  Donald Trump, you're the man.
[01:42:00.693 --> 01:42:01.414]  Let's go.
[01:42:01.414 --> 01:42:01.794]  President.
[01:42:01.794 --> 01:42:03.915]  I think he'd be a wonderful president.
[01:42:03.915 --> 01:42:04.176]  Trump.
[01:42:04.176 --> 01:42:05.236]  He's the man.
[01:42:05.236 --> 01:42:06.177]  Do you like Donald Trump?
[01:42:08.082 --> 01:42:09.963]  Uh, I'd say he seems pretty racist.
[01:42:09.963 --> 01:42:10.844]  Why is he being racist?
[01:42:10.844 --> 01:42:14.867]  Because he classifies all Muslims as bad people when they're not?
[01:42:14.867 --> 01:42:15.347]  No, he doesn't!
[01:42:15.347 --> 01:42:16.948]  He said, VET'EM, you lying trash!
[01:42:16.948 --> 01:42:20.690]  Straight up said, he doesn't want Mexicans or Hispanics to know any country.
[01:42:20.690 --> 01:42:22.432]  What, because of the wall?
[01:42:22.432 --> 01:42:22.792]  Yeah.
[01:42:22.792 --> 01:42:24.513]  Because of the wall in the south part of Mexico, right?
[01:42:25.816 --> 01:42:26.657]  No, I didn't know that.
[01:42:26.657 --> 01:42:29.620]  I've lived with Mexicans, and they're the best people I've ever met on the planet.
[01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:29.860]  Well, good!
[01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:31.762]  They won't let you down in Mexico with no papers, dumbass!
[01:42:31.762 --> 01:42:32.563]  Yes, I do.
[01:42:32.563 --> 01:42:33.223]  Yes, I do.
[01:42:33.223 --> 01:42:34.264]  But they could have one.
[01:42:34.264 --> 01:42:34.765]  They should!
[01:42:34.765 --> 01:42:36.086]  Why can't we have one?
[01:42:36.086 --> 01:42:36.366]  Right?
[01:42:36.366 --> 01:42:37.267]  Well, we can have a border.
[01:42:37.267 --> 01:42:39.089]  I mean, you know, we could have... I didn't get to all of it.
[01:42:39.089 --> 01:42:40.610]  It's for the full video.
[01:42:40.610 --> 01:42:41.691]  InfoWars.com.
[01:42:43.331 --> 01:42:51.313]  I mean, just, you see these people, and all they do is watch mainstream media, and they're so intellectual, and these people can't even tie their shoelaces.
[01:42:51.313 --> 01:42:53.554]  Because they can say, Racist!
[01:42:53.554 --> 01:42:54.774]  Racist!
[01:42:54.774 --> 01:42:57.615]  I'm so intellectual now, I don't know a word!
[01:42:57.615 --> 01:43:03.277]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here to announce the biggest single sale in InfoWars 21 year history.

[01:43:53.972 --> 01:43:55.854]  Without you, none of this is possible.
[01:43:56.574 --> 01:43:57.514]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:43:57.514 --> 01:43:58.094]  Good, brother.
[01:43:58.094 --> 01:43:59.935]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:43:59.935 --> 01:44:01.755]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:44:01.755 --> 01:44:05.777]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:44:05.777 --> 01:44:08.397]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:44:08.397 --> 01:44:10.658]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:44:10.658 --> 01:44:18.680]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:22.242]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:44:22.242 --> 01:44:23.784]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:44:23.784 --> 01:44:26.826]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:44:26.826 --> 01:44:28.467]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:44:28.467 --> 01:44:31.209]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[01:44:31.209 --> 01:44:34.271]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[01:44:34.531 --> 01:44:36.312]  Or maximum potency.
[01:44:36.312 --> 01:44:46.516]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience where stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[01:44:46.516 --> 01:44:48.317]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[01:45:02.116 --> 01:45:06.880]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:08.201]  Talk about the effects.
[01:45:08.201 --> 01:45:09.722]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:45:09.722 --> 01:45:11.644]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:45:11.644 --> 01:45:12.765]  I feel like I look better.
[01:45:12.765 --> 01:45:13.465]  I feel better.
[01:45:13.465 --> 01:45:14.526]  I feel sexier.
[01:45:14.526 --> 01:45:15.247]  I love it.
[01:45:15.487 --> 01:45:18.469]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[01:45:23.671 --> 01:45:26.032]  Visit Infowarslife.com today.
[01:45:26.032 --> 01:45:27.393]  This is life-changing.

[01:45:58.459 --> 01:46:02.242]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:46:02.242 --> 01:46:09.967]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:46:09.967 --> 01:46:18.573]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:46:18.573 --> 01:46:23.015]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:46:23.015 --> 01:46:28.319]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:46:28.319 --> 01:46:29.160]  We're good to go.
[01:47:01.471 --> 01:47:12.999]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:12.999 --> 01:47:16.542]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:47:16.542 --> 01:47:20.925]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:47:20.925 --> 01:47:25.468]  Listen, even if Trump fails, which it looks like he's going to be president, it doesn't matter.
[01:47:25.468 --> 01:47:26.729]  They can run on for a long time.
[01:47:27.930 --> 01:47:30.251]  You can see the public's waking up to him worldwide.
[01:47:30.251 --> 01:47:31.772]  The globalists are in trouble.
[01:47:31.772 --> 01:47:34.533]  Richard, I want to jam in as many calls as we can on this final segment.
[01:47:34.533 --> 01:47:36.955]  You'll be back with us, obviously, this week with the weekday transmission.
[01:47:36.955 --> 01:47:39.656]  But you were talking during the break about Trump's secret weapon.
[01:47:39.656 --> 01:47:42.237]  We shoot a whole video on this because I've seen the numbers.
[01:47:42.237 --> 01:47:42.638]  You're right.
[01:47:42.638 --> 01:47:43.918]  Nobody's talking about this.
[01:47:43.918 --> 01:47:50.702]  Most people are scared to say they like Trump and that they found that most of the undecided, up to 5 to 10 percent, depending on the poll,
[01:47:51.567 --> 01:47:57.375]  Which is another huge whopping win for him, are actually Trump supporters, they're just scared of political correctness.
[01:47:57.375 --> 01:47:59.679]  That's right, they're afraid to speak their minds.
[01:47:59.679 --> 01:48:07.650]  The main venue where you can usually find Trump supporters is at one of these big giant rallies, which by the way, on a regular basis, people can't even get in.
[01:48:08.410 --> 01:48:12.753]  There's been a few events I've tried to get into that I've gotten there 30 minutes or an hour early.
[01:48:12.753 --> 01:48:15.355]  They said, nope, we're not allowing anybody else in.
[01:48:15.355 --> 01:48:20.979]  So literally beyond, beyond, beyond packed houses for Donald Trump events.
[01:48:20.979 --> 01:48:31.307]  Now the other thing is when you're out doing man on the street looking for Trump supporters, I was actually impressed that Joe Biggs and Leanne were able to find people that would actually voice their opinion about Donald Trump.
[01:48:31.307 --> 01:48:32.428]  Some of them said, let's kill him.
[01:48:32.668 --> 01:48:42.539]  Some of them say, let's kill him, and I'll tell you what, the protesters that show up for the Trump events, which that's the bulk of the protests that you do see, they're saying, Donald Trump's a hater, Donald Trump's a hater.
[01:48:42.539 --> 01:48:52.651]  Well, I'll tell you what, those folks need to look in the mirror because the biggest haters that show up... They're political intimidators with their names and wanting to start fights, and I'm sick of it.
[01:48:52.651 --> 01:48:53.472]  I mean, Donald Trump...
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:59.702]  His only problem is he's probably not conservative enough and has been too liberal.
[01:48:59.702 --> 01:49:00.823]  The guy is not racist.
[01:49:00.823 --> 01:49:01.883]  Everybody knows it.
[01:49:01.883 --> 01:49:02.964]  The country is imploding.
[01:49:02.964 --> 01:49:03.984]  We're such a joke.
[01:49:03.984 --> 01:49:06.065]  China, everybody lectures us.
[01:49:06.065 --> 01:49:07.426]  Nobody else would put up with this.
[01:49:07.426 --> 01:49:10.007]  We just are like a beaten woman.
[01:49:10.007 --> 01:49:13.029]  No, when it comes to trade, we are despoiled.
[01:49:13.029 --> 01:49:14.349]  It's despoiled economics.
[01:49:14.349 --> 01:49:15.990]  Nobody gang rapes us like the system.
[01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.250]  Exactly.
[01:49:16.250 --> 01:49:17.611]  Because we're politically correct.
[01:49:17.611 --> 01:49:18.431]  Exactly.
[01:49:18.431 --> 01:49:21.453]  I'm a Christian, but it is this Christian ethic to like
[01:49:22.273 --> 01:49:25.896]  Lay yourself down and say you're bad and let people walk on you.
[01:49:25.896 --> 01:49:29.538]  That's good in a Christ-like way, but not in corporate stuff and national stuff.
[01:49:29.538 --> 01:49:30.058]  It's over.
[01:49:30.058 --> 01:49:30.539]  It's sick.
[01:49:30.539 --> 01:49:32.340]  It's a cuckolding fetish.
[01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:36.122]  And America's fetish of being walked on is over, folks.
[01:49:36.122 --> 01:49:36.843]  It's over.
[01:49:36.843 --> 01:49:37.904]  Absolute despoiling.
[01:49:37.904 --> 01:49:40.725]  Chris in Indiana, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:49:40.725 --> 01:49:45.288]  Hey Alex, hey Richard.
[01:49:45.288 --> 01:49:45.729]  Go ahead.
[01:49:45.729 --> 01:49:46.009]  Thank you.
[01:49:47.412 --> 01:49:51.253]  Hey, uh, I just wanted to get a... I'm a Trump supporter, first of all.
[01:49:51.253 --> 01:49:54.374]  Um, hopefully he does very well on Super Tuesday.
[01:49:54.374 --> 01:49:55.054]  Good.
[01:49:55.054 --> 01:49:58.435]  And I just wanted to point out a potential flaw.
[01:49:58.435 --> 01:50:08.478]  I mean, it might not be the end all end all, but, uh, this has happened in the past in politics and I know he's not asking for donations.
[01:50:08.478 --> 01:50:14.760]  I mean, I've donated a hundred bucks myself, but he's begging people not to ask for donations and
[01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:28.283]  I think that this might be a thing that the Democratic Party might be holding in their back pocket for the general election is saying that he's buying the election because if you look at Bernie Sanders... Of course they're going to spend it, but he's an outsider.
[01:50:28.283 --> 01:50:29.865]  Thank God he's spending his own money.
[01:50:29.865 --> 01:50:32.908]  But he's really doing the campaign as an air war, not spending money.
[01:50:32.908 --> 01:50:34.650]  But no, I get your point.
[01:50:34.650 --> 01:50:36.191]  They'll say, look, he bought the election.
[01:50:36.191 --> 01:50:38.354]  No, the people that already bought the country fraudulently
[01:50:38.894 --> 01:50:41.735]  That bought our politicians, not our country, and think they own it?
[01:50:41.735 --> 01:50:43.776]  They've been given the deed, but it's a fraud.
[01:50:43.776 --> 01:50:47.678]  They're the ones, the Koch brothers and others, that all these idiots always accuse me of.
[01:50:47.678 --> 01:50:49.279]  I've never gotten a dime from the Koch brothers.
[01:50:49.279 --> 01:50:50.420]  See, that's another selling point.
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:52.641]  The Koch brothers and Fox News hate my guts.
[01:50:52.641 --> 01:50:59.524]  It's another selling point that Donald Trump can spin right there because he constantly seems to do the most with the least.
[01:50:59.524 --> 01:51:01.025]  He keeps doing the most with the least.
[01:51:01.025 --> 01:51:03.706]  It shows how changing the formula can do that for America.
[01:51:03.706 --> 01:51:04.466]  Good to hear from you.
[01:51:04.466 --> 01:51:05.347]  Absolutely.
[01:51:05.347 --> 01:51:07.228]  The political class hates Trump, okay?
[01:51:07.228 --> 01:51:07.828]  Chris, thank you.
[01:51:08.408 --> 01:51:09.708]  Jesse in Connecticut.
[01:51:09.708 --> 01:51:10.289]  Connecticut.
[01:51:10.289 --> 01:51:12.109]  Jesse, go ahead.
[01:51:12.109 --> 01:51:13.690]  Hey, Alex.
[01:51:13.690 --> 01:51:17.631]  I just want to say I love your products and everything.
[01:51:17.631 --> 01:51:29.675]  And about Trump is, I think with the badness of the mainstream media, do you think it's time for the alternative media to step up and do a presidential debate?
[01:51:30.658 --> 01:51:32.659]  Sure, that'll happen probably next round.
[01:51:32.659 --> 01:51:33.799]  The mainstream media is dying.
[01:51:33.799 --> 01:51:37.040]  People still, the politicos think, oh CNN, Fox, it's so big.
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:41.222]  They don't even get that numbers like this show or Drudge are bigger than that.
[01:51:41.222 --> 01:51:46.844]  But I bet if Drudge wanted to, you would have already seen a Drudge-sponsored debate.
[01:51:46.844 --> 01:51:50.806]  But Drudge likes the whole, you know, kind of elusiveness.
[01:51:52.577 --> 01:51:56.122]  I don't know, just the fact that he's so avant-garde that he's not out there in the public.
[01:51:56.122 --> 01:51:57.264]  Unless he's popping into my show.
[01:51:57.264 --> 01:52:00.929]  Well, knowing Drudge, he could just put his name on it and have the event and have other people do it.
[01:52:00.929 --> 01:52:01.891]  You know, put it on like that.
[01:52:01.891 --> 01:52:03.093]  And then have it televised at Drudge.
[01:52:03.093 --> 01:52:04.114]  Anybody else want to pick it up?
[01:52:04.114 --> 01:52:05.095]  Absolutely.
[01:52:05.095 --> 01:52:07.659]  But yes, that's already here, that's already coming.
[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:10.663]  But we just cover what they're covering anyways.
[01:52:10.663 --> 01:52:12.544]  We just show the debate and do our own analysis.
[01:52:12.544 --> 01:52:14.266]  But that's basically already happened.
[01:52:14.266 --> 01:52:19.131]  I mean, Trump is bypassing the mainstream media and going to alternative media and winning, because we're not the alternative.
[01:52:19.131 --> 01:52:20.232]  We're the real media.
[01:52:20.232 --> 01:52:20.653]  Right.
[01:52:20.653 --> 01:52:29.162]  And to give you an idea of how CNN is still trying to grasp at what little control they have over the mainstream media, is at the University of Houston, when they did the debate,
[01:52:29.702 --> 01:52:35.805]  Literally, folks, what they did is they built a perimeter around the venue, including the parking.
[01:52:35.805 --> 01:52:46.972]  All the people that attended the debate had to have a parking pass to park within the perimeter because they didn't want people like us or any outsiders at all coming and even getting opinions from the people that attended the debate.
[01:52:46.972 --> 01:52:48.412]  So that's how they're still grasping.
[01:52:48.412 --> 01:52:51.154]  It's all about an attempt to not even have exit polls.
[01:52:51.154 --> 01:52:51.414]  Right.
[01:52:51.414 --> 01:52:52.255]  That they don't control.
[01:52:52.255 --> 01:52:53.075]  Exactly.
[01:52:53.075 --> 01:52:53.475]  Good point.
[01:52:53.475 --> 01:52:54.576]  Appreciate your call.
[01:52:54.576 --> 01:52:56.477]  Anything else, Jesse?
[01:52:56.477 --> 01:52:57.297]  I love your products.
[01:52:57.297 --> 01:52:57.858]  Keep making them.
[01:52:57.858 --> 01:52:58.198]  I'll buy them.
[01:52:58.789 --> 01:52:59.409]  Thank you, sir.
[01:52:59.409 --> 01:53:02.731]  Yeah, we've got the biggest sale ever in the history of InfoWars.
[01:53:02.731 --> 01:53:04.212]  Leap Year Sale.
[01:53:04.212 --> 01:53:04.732]  Came out of nowhere.
[01:53:04.732 --> 01:53:05.753]  We just thought of it last week.
[01:53:05.753 --> 01:53:07.254]  People love it.
[01:53:07.254 --> 01:53:12.457]  It is 30% off and free shipping and a bunch of other specials, too, stacked on that InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:53:12.457 --> 01:53:14.318]  And we need the small profit we make.
[01:53:15.018 --> 01:53:19.620]  To fund the operation, hopefully expand in the face of this, but we're putting on all sale.
[01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:21.800]  We are fighting as hard as we can.
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:22.841]  We are committed.
[01:53:22.841 --> 01:53:24.261]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:53:24.261 --> 01:53:25.681]  Thank you, Jesse.
[01:53:25.681 --> 01:53:29.042]  Folks, get X2, get OxyPowder, get Liver Shield.
[01:53:29.042 --> 01:53:30.483]  Get these game-changing products.
[01:53:30.483 --> 01:53:31.623]  Experience them for yourself.
[01:53:31.623 --> 01:53:36.865]  You have nothing to lose because you're supporting the Infowar, but I want you to try them because almost everybody comes back.
[01:53:37.045 --> 01:53:38.366]  Total war bonds, folks.
[01:53:38.366 --> 01:53:39.266]  Total war bonds.
[01:53:39.266 --> 01:53:39.807]  Absolutely.
[01:53:39.807 --> 01:53:41.768]  Yeah, I couldn't be out there doing what I'm doing.
[01:53:41.768 --> 01:53:45.230]  Alex couldn't send me out there to Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, etc.
[01:53:45.230 --> 01:53:45.490]  Vegas.
[01:53:45.490 --> 01:53:46.571]  Without you guys' support.
[01:53:46.571 --> 01:53:47.211]  Yeah, it's unbelievable.
[01:53:47.211 --> 01:53:47.492]  That's right.
[01:53:47.492 --> 01:53:48.532]  It's a lot of money, folks.
[01:53:48.532 --> 01:53:50.654]  John in D.C., you're on the air.
[01:53:50.654 --> 01:53:51.414]  This is a war.
[01:53:51.414 --> 01:53:52.295]  John, God bless you.
[01:53:52.295 --> 01:53:52.615]  Go ahead.
[01:53:53.928 --> 01:53:59.811]  Yeah, so would you promote flyers nationwide through your show to support Trump?
[01:53:59.811 --> 01:54:01.872]  That's sort of an idea.
[01:54:01.872 --> 01:54:09.676]  Sure, I'd love to put up flyers and then people, maybe 20 different flyers, and folks could print those off and tell my listeners to flyer their areas.
[01:54:09.676 --> 01:54:10.337]  That's a great idea.
[01:54:11.465 --> 01:54:12.345]  Billboards, etc.
[01:54:12.345 --> 01:54:14.666]  You had folks last year popping up, putting up billboards.
[01:54:14.666 --> 01:54:15.767]  Yeah, for InfoWars.
[01:54:15.767 --> 01:54:16.507]  Doing it for Trump.
[01:54:16.507 --> 01:54:18.488]  I mean, it's really all up to you, you know.
[01:54:18.488 --> 01:54:19.448]  Fire on all guns.
[01:54:19.448 --> 01:54:20.068]  That's what we do.
[01:54:20.068 --> 01:54:20.769]  We fire on all guns.
[01:54:20.769 --> 01:54:21.849]  Yeah, just go to the sound of the guns.
[01:54:21.849 --> 01:54:22.829]  It's a founding father quote.
[01:54:22.829 --> 01:54:27.451]  In fact, Google, who first said, don't wait for orders from headquarters, go to the sound of the guns?
[01:54:27.451 --> 01:54:31.613]  I mean, I know Buchanan, when I was first working for him in a political campaign, you know, made that comment.
[01:54:31.613 --> 01:54:35.314]  But it was a founder who said, don't wait for orders from headquarters, because there aren't.
[01:54:35.314 --> 01:54:36.474]  Go to the sound of the guns.
[01:54:36.474 --> 01:54:36.995]  Yep.
[01:54:36.995 --> 01:54:38.975]  I mean, that's really what we do.
[01:54:38.975 --> 01:54:39.916]  And that is what... That's it.
[01:54:40.876 --> 01:54:42.838]  There are no orders from headquarters.
[01:54:42.838 --> 01:54:44.260]  All leaders go to the sound of the guns.
[01:54:57.393 --> 01:55:00.454]  They have literally moved our precinct conventions to Saturday.
[01:55:00.454 --> 01:55:04.036]  Normally they happen on Tuesday, the election day, that evening.
[01:55:04.036 --> 01:55:08.517]  Now, to keep us from attending, and see this is just a dirty... Now they want time to wait and politico it.
[01:55:08.517 --> 01:55:11.599]  Yeah, they want you to forget about going, and so... Snicker-snack it.
[01:55:11.599 --> 01:55:14.900]  That kind of stuff is going on nationwide, county by county.
[01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:16.601]  The system's doing everything it can.
[01:55:16.601 --> 01:55:17.221]  Bingo.
[01:55:17.221 --> 01:55:18.561]  And people go, well they're going to steal it!
[01:55:18.561 --> 01:55:19.782]  That's, it's a battle!
[01:55:19.782 --> 01:55:20.182]  Yep.
[01:55:20.182 --> 01:55:21.182]  It's a battle!
[01:55:21.182 --> 01:55:22.283]  Engage, engage.
[01:55:22.283 --> 01:55:25.084]  I'll tell you what... Who first said, I'll go to the sound of the guns?
[01:55:29.537 --> 01:55:30.258]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:55:43.450 --> 01:55:49.154]  I just wondered if you heard the good news just before I get to Trump, but it sounds like Melissa Harris Perry lost her show.
[01:55:49.154 --> 01:55:52.877]  Yeah, I didn't get to that, but she was on four or five shows as a commentator.
[01:55:52.877 --> 01:55:55.358]  They had her own little weird show with bad ratings.
[01:55:55.358 --> 01:55:58.160]  And then because of the election, they were preempting it, which is normal.
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:03.304]  When I used to be on the radio at night just locally, they'd preempt me for high school football, and I'd just be on after or before.
[01:56:03.304 --> 01:56:04.465]  I didn't bitch about it.
[01:56:04.465 --> 01:56:05.866]  I knew that was part of the thing.
[01:56:05.866 --> 01:56:13.151]  She literally said they were racist, that they did this with their global, which they are a racist channel, the Great Race Division, but claimed they did this because she's a black
[01:56:13.271 --> 01:56:16.993]  What a kook, man.
[01:56:16.993 --> 01:56:18.574]  These people even buy their own bull.
[01:56:18.574 --> 01:56:21.877]  Well, for me, it kind of makes me think of the Queen song, Another One Bites the Dust.
[01:56:21.877 --> 01:56:23.157]  Another One Bites the Dust?
[01:56:23.157 --> 01:56:23.778]  That's right.
[01:56:23.778 --> 01:56:25.419]  Another One Bites the Dust?
[01:56:25.419 --> 01:56:26.880]  She had no viewers anyways.
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:29.261]  She was already a rotting facade.
[01:56:29.261 --> 01:56:30.282]  She was dead already.
[01:56:30.282 --> 01:56:33.804]  This zombie just woke up and realized she was dead already politically.
[01:56:33.804 --> 01:56:36.026]  The woman that says our kids belong to her.
[01:56:36.026 --> 01:56:39.048]  As Matt Drudge would say, a head on a stick, a brain in a jar, right there.
[01:56:39.048 --> 01:56:40.108]  That's right.
[01:56:40.108 --> 01:56:40.789]  Alex, go ahead.
[01:56:42.113 --> 01:56:44.258]  Yeah, no, I think the David Duke thing is a smear too.
[01:56:44.258 --> 01:56:46.864]  It seems kind of a funny set-up, definitely.
[01:56:46.864 --> 01:56:48.508]  I don't know.
[01:56:48.508 --> 01:56:49.991]  The timing is, of course, pretty good.
[01:56:51.141 --> 01:56:56.543]  Well, the David Duke supporters have just behind the scenes done all sorts of weird chicanery with us and stuff.
[01:56:56.543 --> 01:56:58.003]  I think it's cute and funny.
[01:56:58.003 --> 01:56:58.463]  I don't care.
[01:56:58.463 --> 01:56:59.884]  It's a religion.
[01:56:59.884 --> 01:57:01.504]  He's like their daddy.
[01:57:01.504 --> 01:57:02.925]  He's their leader.
[01:57:02.925 --> 01:57:03.945]  And that's fine.
[01:57:03.945 --> 01:57:06.926]  I mean, me, I want everybody to have freedom, everybody to be empowered.
[01:57:06.926 --> 01:57:08.506]  I don't want brain chips for humanity.
[01:57:08.506 --> 01:57:12.728]  I don't want Mexican kids being shot up with Gardasil that sterilizes them, just like I don't want kids in America.
[01:57:12.728 --> 01:57:13.588]  I just care about everybody.
[01:57:13.988 --> 01:57:17.932]  I also hate racist blacks and Hispanics and others that hate me because I'm white.
[01:57:17.932 --> 01:57:19.994]  But I don't like whites that hate them because they're a different color.
[01:57:19.994 --> 01:57:22.276]  I just, I like Martin Luther King, what he said.
[01:57:22.276 --> 01:57:23.237]  You know, not...
[01:57:24.884 --> 01:57:25.684]  It's just amazing.
[01:57:25.684 --> 01:57:27.145]  It's just amazing.
[01:57:27.145 --> 01:57:28.325]  Hey, great job, Richard.
[01:57:28.325 --> 01:57:29.105]  Great job of the crew.
[01:57:29.105 --> 01:57:31.266]  I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m.
