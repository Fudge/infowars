[00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.221]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:26.345]  It is Thursday, June 23, 2016, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:27.687]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:40.900]  Tonight, while the sit-ins of the 1960s were to gain rights, the sit-ins of Democrats now are to take rights away.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.084]  Then, a tie in the Supreme Court blocks Obama's immigration policy.
[00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:53.028]  After that, should students be admitted or rejected based on their skin color?
[00:00:53.868 --> 00:01:00.853]  And, the media fact checks Hillary's past and comes up with some rather hilarious excuses for her actions.
[00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:02.054]  That's next.
[00:01:02.927 --> 00:01:10.052]  Maybe you're just at work right now and it's casual shirt Friday and one of your hipster buddies walks in with a Hillary Clinton shirt saying, I'm with her.
[00:01:10.492 --> 00:01:10.852]  Negative!
[00:01:10.892 --> 00:01:11.633]  This is what you're going to do.
[00:01:11.793 --> 00:01:14.614]  You're going to stand up and go, Hillary for prison!
[00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:15.495]  Benghazi!
[00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.432]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com with an extremely important message.
[00:01:55.933 --> 00:02:00.916]  You're probably asking yourself right now, what's the most important phrase in America right now?
[00:02:01.456 --> 00:02:03.658]  Well, it happens to be Hillary for prison.
[00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:07.420]  Get your Hillary for prison t-shirt today at the InfoWars store for $9.95.
[00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:10.482]  That's half of what it used to be at $19.95.
[00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:12.904]  Why do you want to get this?
[00:02:12.964 --> 00:02:15.485]  Why should you buy this for you and your friends and family?
[00:02:15.826 --> 00:02:18.968]  Because number one, it's a great conversation starter, and number two,
[00:02:19.648 --> 00:02:24.212]  Hell, you get to trigger a whole lot of crazy liberal commie bastards, and that's what I like to do.
[00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:31.778]  And maybe you're just at work right now, and it's casual shirt Friday, and one of your hipster buddies walks in with a Hillary Clinton shirt saying, I'm with her.
[00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:32.599]  Negative!
[00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:33.360]  This is what you're gonna do.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.362]  You're gonna stand up and go, ah, Hillary for prison!
[00:02:36.582 --> 00:02:37.303]  Benghazi!
[00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:43.048]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:50.447]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get your Hillary for Prison shirt today for $9.95 and trigger more assholes like him.
[00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.270]  Come on, Hillary.
[00:02:53.471 --> 00:02:54.051]  Just a little.
[00:02:54.352 --> 00:02:55.132]  Just a little sip.
[00:02:55.693 --> 00:02:55.993]  Open up.
[00:02:56.314 --> 00:02:57.215]  Come on, take it!
[00:02:57.695 --> 00:02:58.076]  Take it!
[00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:13.942]  Well, there are many important decisions being made at the Supreme Court today, the most important of which is Obama's immigration plan, which has been deadlocked, blocked by a 4-4 tie there at the Supreme Court.
[00:03:14.383 --> 00:03:17.746]  Now, this was President Obama's immigration plan that sought to shield
[00:03:18.326 --> 00:03:20.386]  Millions who are already living in the U.S.
[00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.387]  illegally from deportation.
[00:03:22.867 --> 00:03:26.348]  It has effectively been killed for the rest of his presidency.
[00:03:26.788 --> 00:03:37.230]  Now, people who would have benefited from Obama's plan face no imminent threat of deportation because Congress has only provided money to deal with a small percentage of people who live in this country illegally.
[00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.651]  But his efforts to expand that protection to many other people is what has been blocked.
[00:03:44.091 --> 00:04:00.341]  Now, Obama responded saying that this takes us further from the country we aspire to be, which if that's if the we he is talking about is the country he and Hillary Clinton are aspiring towards, that is just open borders and bringing in unvetted
[00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:03.704]  Foreigners from regions that are infested with terrorism.
[00:04:04.164 --> 00:04:12.853]  Now, according to a Senate committee report coming out of the offices of Senator Jeff Sessions, there have been 580 terror convictions here in the U.S.
[00:04:12.993 --> 00:04:15.055]  since 9-11, and 380 of those terrorists have been foreign-born.
[00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.500]  So this means that they either got to the U.S.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.141]  through illegal immigration or via a U.S.
[00:04:24.241 --> 00:04:28.662]  government-allowed legal immigration or a visa program or the refugee program.
[00:04:29.022 --> 00:04:38.005]  So the subcommittee had to conduct this research open source because they struggled with the Obama administration to find out where these people were actually from.
[00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:45.208]  And they found that of the 380 foreign-born, at least 24 were initially admitted to the U.S.
[00:04:45.288 --> 00:04:45.968]  as refugees.
[00:04:46.329 --> 00:04:48.430]  At least 33 overstayed their visas.
[00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:58.395]  They came from Pakistan, Lebanon, some are Palestinian, Somalian, Yemen, Iraq, Jordan, Egypt, and some from Afghanistan.
[00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:15.252]  Now, they talk a lot about how they have been fighting for more than 10 months to get this information from the Obama administration, and they passed it along to the DOJ to provide the information to the subcommittee on where these terrorist convictions, where they were actually from.
[00:05:15.633 --> 00:05:23.735]  They were trying to hide this information, of course, because this could be used against Hillary Clinton, as well as President Obama, while they're trying to get this passed.
[00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:31.262]  And so Jeff Sessions actually wrote just last week directly to the President, pressing him on this very issue.
[00:05:31.822 --> 00:05:32.403]  And he says,
[00:05:44.654 --> 00:05:48.216]  And assimilate those we admit paints a striking picture.
[00:05:48.776 --> 00:06:02.002]  And given that we've already identified at least 40 individuals who were initially admitted to this country as refugees and were subsequently convicted or implicated in terrorism, including an Iraqi refugee who was just admitted to the U.S.
[00:06:02.062 --> 00:06:11.206]  in 2012 and arrested in January of this year, it is clear that ensuring the proper screening of refugees is of the utmost importance.
[00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:19.309]  Indeed, but you know, I think that we're all just going to continue to be called crazy conspiracy theorists until people finally get a clue.
[00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:28.152]  Another big decision that went today in the Supreme Court, they upheld a University of Texas affirmative action admissions.
[00:06:28.732 --> 00:06:33.494]  So they said that the University of Texas may consider the race of a student
[00:06:34.765 --> 00:06:38.707]  of student applicants in a limited way to build a diverse student body.
[00:06:39.087 --> 00:06:58.898]  Now this was a 4-3 decision and it was a surprising win for advocates of affirmative action who say the benefits of diversity at the nation's colleges and universities are worth the intrusion on the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection that generally forbids the government from making decisions based on racial classifications.
[00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:02.320]  So that's why this was very surprising that the Supreme Court upheld
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.742]  This decision for affirmative action decades ago, I can see where this was a very important thing.
[00:07:08.202 --> 00:07:10.863]  But now, it is absolutely unfair.
[00:07:10.923 --> 00:07:14.004]  It's not in line with the constitutional promise of equal treatment.
[00:07:14.524 --> 00:07:20.966]  And the girl that actually brought this case forward, they're making fun of her on Twitter, calling her Becky with the bad grades.
[00:07:21.286 --> 00:07:23.307]  But it's not about having bad grades.
[00:07:23.347 --> 00:07:28.369]  You can be a spectacular student, have stellar grades, and if you're white, you might not get in.
[00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:31.010]  Due to affirmative action.
[00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:37.815]  And this is also interesting considering that the population of non-whites is continuing to grow.
[00:07:37.895 --> 00:07:44.439]  And here in Austin, Texas, where the university is, less than half of the population here is actually white.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:58.149]  And according to the National Center for Education Statistics, black women have recently emerged as the most educated population of people by race and gender in the United States.
[00:07:58.829 --> 00:08:05.894]  So this means that they are a very powerful force in not only the political realm, but also in the business world.
[00:08:06.274 --> 00:08:12.539]  So no, that does not mean that minorities are taking over the United States, as some people out there are going to probably say in the comments.
[00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:19.104]  This just means it is time to rethink the victim status and maybe rethink this whole affirmative action thing.
[00:08:19.884 --> 00:08:26.087]  And another great decision that came down the high courts are going to limit drunk driving test laws.
[00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:36.393]  So this was the Supreme Court placed new limits on state laws that make it a crime for motorists suspected of drunken driving to refuse alcohol tests.
[00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:47.286]  So the justices ruled that police must obtain a search warrant before requiring drivers to take blood alcohol tests, but not breath tests, which the court considers less intrusive.
[00:08:47.647 --> 00:08:55.776]  And writing for the majority, Justice Alito said that breath tests do not implicate significant privacy concerns, unlike blood tests.
[00:08:56.277 --> 00:09:02.381]  Breathing into a breathalyzer doesn't pierce the skin or leave a biological sample in the government's possession.
[00:09:02.561 --> 00:09:11.168]  So that's going to be very great because here, I know in many other states, but definitely here in Texas, there is a no refusal and they'll just draw your blood right on the spot.
[00:09:11.328 --> 00:09:13.449]  So this might be able to change that.
[00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:16.271]  People can say it is a violation of their civil rights.
[00:09:17.032 --> 00:09:21.015]  Now on Monday, four NYPD officials were arrested
[00:09:21.955 --> 00:09:24.297]  In a cops-on-call corruption probe.
[00:09:24.577 --> 00:09:26.398]  So these were four NYPD officials.
[00:09:26.458 --> 00:09:37.685]  They were arrested for accepting trips, lavish gifts, and prostitutes from two Brooklyn businesses in exchange for police escorts, access, and gun licenses.
[00:09:38.105 --> 00:09:43.629]  And that's very interesting because gun licenses are extremely hard to get in New York.
[00:09:44.029 --> 00:09:47.471]  And as Jakari Jackson always points out, gun regulations
[00:09:47.831 --> 00:09:48.292]  I think so.
[00:10:04.955 --> 00:10:21.448]  Now, a New York Democratic rep, Charlie Rangel, was actually asked about this and about the gun-permitting bribery scandal, and he actually said, you know, members of Congress deserve and need people with firearms protecting them, but not the law-abiding citizens.
[00:10:21.568 --> 00:10:22.029]  Take a listen.
[00:10:23.567 --> 00:10:31.269]  Why should, say, the uber-wealthy, who have protection, have that protection, but individuals who are law-abiding citizens in your district should not?
[00:10:31.289 --> 00:10:32.809]  Let's talk about that.
[00:10:33.149 --> 00:10:39.571]  Well, law-abiding citizens just shouldn't have to carry a gun, you know that, so you're not going to push me in that direction.
[00:10:39.591 --> 00:10:42.232]  But you're protected by guns all over the place here in the Capitol.
[00:10:45.633 --> 00:10:46.953]  Well, that's a little different.
[00:10:47.013 --> 00:10:50.954]  I think we deserve, I think we need to be protected down here.
[00:10:52.244 --> 00:10:59.189]  See, you do not deserve or need to be able to protect yourself and your family, only the very important people who we put in office.
[00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.952]  Now, Rangel was one of the people who were on the House floor yesterday.
[00:11:03.012 --> 00:11:08.937]  He was actually periscoping this sit-in spectacle, and they call it a spectacle.
[00:11:09.857 --> 00:11:17.763]  Representative Mark Walker, who was there, tweeted out that it was actually a disgrace to Woolworths to call this a sit-in because
[00:11:18.764 --> 00:11:25.771]  Those people back then were asking for rights while the House Democrats are protesting to have people's rights taken away.
[00:11:26.571 --> 00:11:32.157]  And so now obviously they're using their new social justice warrior tactics saying, are they going to shut us down?
[00:11:32.177 --> 00:11:33.738]  Because they turned off the cameras.
[00:11:33.978 --> 00:11:37.902]  So then they start live streaming this, just trying to get as much attention as they can.
[00:11:38.663 --> 00:11:42.006]  And Washington Free Weekend's editor in chief pointed out
[00:11:42.526 --> 00:11:50.368]  That the sit-in isn't going to matter much because the Democrats have been very quick to reframe the gun control fights as anti-terror fights.
[00:11:50.748 --> 00:11:53.629]  And that's been going on since the Orlando attack.
[00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:56.469]  And things got very heated on the floor there yesterday.
[00:11:57.009 --> 00:11:57.250]  Rep.
[00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:06.472]  Louie Gohmert was actually taking them to task on that, saying all the things that they're asking for would not have stopped the Orlando terror attack.
[00:12:06.512 --> 00:12:07.012]  Take a listen.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.982]  And as you can see, a lot of people were very passionate about this.
[00:12:24.022 --> 00:12:29.486]  This is radical Islamic extremism, and that is the real thing that we need to be dealing with in this country.
[00:12:29.826 --> 00:12:36.851]  Now, Gohmert went on to say that they are using the instruments that helped gain civil rights to try to take away civil rights.
[00:12:37.731 --> 00:12:45.134]  He said, I'm telling you, this was incredible to see real American folk heroes like John Lewis, who was brutalized and stood up for civil rights.
[00:12:45.554 --> 00:12:50.416]  Folks were there using the instruments that helped gain civil rights to try to take away our civil rights.
[00:12:50.756 --> 00:12:52.157]  Now we pointed this out yesterday.
[00:12:52.517 --> 00:12:58.199]  John Lewis was actually on a secret government list there with LBJ during the civil rights.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:04.222]  So he knows what it's like to be on a secret government list and some government agency can just arbitrarily put you on it.
[00:13:04.702 --> 00:13:07.164]  But he was also on the no-fly list.
[00:13:07.224 --> 00:13:14.409]  He had been stopped some 30, 45 times, asked about this, and he had to deal with this for more than a year to try to get taken off that list.
[00:13:14.849 --> 00:13:15.670]  But that's not all.
[00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:21.114]  He was actually also someone who signed a letter to the Department of Homeland Security in 2014.
[00:13:23.155 --> 00:13:26.217]  Expressing some concern over this program.
[00:13:26.517 --> 00:13:32.901]  They say watch lists are an important tool to guard against terrorism, but they must strike the right balance with the U.S.
[00:13:33.042 --> 00:13:34.322]  civil rights and liberties.
[00:13:34.683 --> 00:13:41.067]  And they were concerned at the program that was put in place to give people steps to redress being put on this list.
[00:13:41.587 --> 00:13:47.349]  They were concerned that it provides no effective means of redress or unfair or incorrect designations.
[00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:55.733]  So they know that this is something that people can put on this list arbitrarily and it's very difficult to get yourself off of this list.
[00:13:56.113 --> 00:14:01.235]  Paul Ryan came out and said that this Democratic stunt is not a proud moment for democracy.
[00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:07.318]  He said this isn't very proud for democracy or for the people who staged these stunts.
[00:14:07.758 --> 00:14:09.399]  He said this is the people's house.
[00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:16.142]  This is Congress, the House of Representatives, the oldest democracy in the world, and they're descending it into chaos.
[00:14:16.542 --> 00:14:17.883]  Why do I call this a stunt?
[00:14:18.223 --> 00:14:19.644]  Well, because it is one.
[00:14:20.024 --> 00:14:25.226]  There was a vote, it was in the committee, through regular order, and the vote failed.
[00:14:25.506 --> 00:14:27.687]  And that's something that they're not wanting to talk about.
[00:14:27.747 --> 00:14:28.367]  That's a fact.
[00:14:28.407 --> 00:14:29.708]  There was a vote and it failed.
[00:14:30.048 --> 00:14:31.629]  He said if Democrats want to vote,
[00:14:31.949 --> 00:14:34.031]  For a bill on the floor, there's a way to get one.
[00:14:34.372 --> 00:14:38.957]  It just takes 218 signatures on a petition and they can have a vote.
[00:14:39.017 --> 00:14:39.778]  It's that simple.
[00:14:40.699 --> 00:14:42.180]  But what they're doing, that's not it.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.744]  And they're actually trying to get this done through a different order.
[00:14:45.944 --> 00:14:48.127]  Staging protests, trying to get it on TV.
[00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:49.188]  I don't know.
[00:15:05.225 --> 00:15:07.667]  Which absolutely wasn't going to be effective at all.
[00:15:08.168 --> 00:15:12.612]  And he went on to say that our focus needs to be on confronting radical extremism.
[00:15:12.932 --> 00:15:14.393]  Terrorism is the issue.
[00:15:14.714 --> 00:15:15.674]  Let me say it again.
[00:15:15.975 --> 00:15:19.618]  Terrorism is the issue and defeating terrorism is our focus here in the house.
[00:15:20.078 --> 00:15:21.940]  So this is the people's house.
[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:27.245]  So Jakari Jackson took to the streets of Austin, Texas to find out what the people thought of this stunt.
[00:15:28.607 --> 00:15:36.190]  As we speak, there's a sit-in on Capitol Hill where the participants hope that their actions will draw attention to the four gun bills that recently failed in the Senate.
[00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:41.991]  Now, what's interesting about these four is that they all contain language about background checks in some measure or another.
[00:15:42.352 --> 00:15:49.254]  And it's leading many people to question, well, even if these bills have been retroactive, would they have prevented San Bernardino or, more recently, Orlando?
[00:15:50.134 --> 00:15:57.542]  Also, people are pointing out that one of the participants in the sit-in is John Lewis, a representative who has found himself a victim of the no-fly list.
[00:15:57.802 --> 00:16:01.186]  So we're going to talk to the people here today and see if the sit-in is the right way to go.
[00:16:01.206 --> 00:16:05.690]  Do you think it's good for the civilian populace at large to have the right to bear arms?
[00:16:06.911 --> 00:16:07.012]  Yes.
[00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:07.132]  Okay.
[00:16:07.799 --> 00:16:12.903]  And with the Democratic sit-ins, one of the things they're trying to bring attention to is the bills that failed this week.
[00:16:13.023 --> 00:16:15.985]  They're basically all gun background check bills.
[00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:24.411]  Do you think that gun background check bills, had they been retroactive, would have prevented Orlando, San Bernardino, or any number of the other shootings that we've seen here recently?
[00:16:24.671 --> 00:16:25.232]  I think they could.
[00:16:26.586 --> 00:16:30.789]  We could go farther into background checks before those type of guns are sold.
[00:16:31.149 --> 00:16:38.335]  If any of the bills that were up for vote that failed, would any of those prevent San Bernardino or Orlando, even if they had been retroactively passed?
[00:16:38.395 --> 00:16:44.160]  You know, if I was marketing it, I would be saying like, it's not about prevention, but it's lies.
[00:16:45.501 --> 00:16:45.921]  You know what?
[00:16:45.961 --> 00:16:47.541]  Maybe the guy couldn't have gone in an arsenal.
[00:16:47.561 --> 00:16:48.642]  Maybe he still could have gone in guns.
[00:16:48.722 --> 00:16:53.723]  Maybe instead of in Orlando, he would have killed 48, or 47, or 45.
[00:16:54.663 --> 00:16:56.923]  But at least there would have been that many more lives not killed.
[00:16:57.123 --> 00:17:06.625]  So if he couldn't do that gun, and if he could do another type of gun instead, does he still going to feel that his Second Amendment rights are, maybe they're infringed upon, but he still has Second Amendment rights?
[00:17:06.665 --> 00:17:08.125]  Well, they're, shall not be infringed.
[00:17:08.225 --> 00:17:09.306]  It's right there in the Constitution.
[00:17:09.326 --> 00:17:10.046]  Shall not be infringed.
[00:17:10.086 --> 00:17:11.726]  He has a semi-automatic gun.
[00:17:11.886 --> 00:17:13.166]  Questions on freedom of speech too.
[00:17:13.227 --> 00:17:18.649]  I mean, you know, we can only take it as not just carte blanche, excuse me, not just carte blanche, same things with guns.
[00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:22.730]  You know, all of our amendments have certain limitations to them, you know.
[00:17:23.791 --> 00:17:25.771]  I think it's a very dated law.
[00:17:26.472 --> 00:17:33.394]  I don't think you should, especially to automatic weaponries that are totally designed to kill humans, like, I don't think anyone should have access to that.
[00:17:34.334 --> 00:17:36.635]  I think guns should be absolutely controlled.
[00:17:37.516 --> 00:17:37.956]  In what way?
[00:17:38.658 --> 00:17:39.759]  Much more than they are now.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.402]  I think background checks should be improved.
[00:17:42.642 --> 00:17:45.726]  I honestly don't think there's a necessity for guns.
[00:17:46.206 --> 00:17:51.211]  Other than for sport, I don't think they should be used for self-protection.
[00:17:52.112 --> 00:17:53.894]  You don't think they should be used for self-protection?
[00:17:53.934 --> 00:17:58.079]  I mean, I see people that have guns and they use them to like...
[00:17:59.417 --> 00:17:59.957]  Kill people.
[00:18:00.557 --> 00:18:06.579]  I think if everybody had a gun in return to defend themselves, people would just go crazy.
[00:18:06.899 --> 00:18:10.139]  I mean, there's already cops shooting people who are unarmed.
[00:18:10.679 --> 00:18:18.501]  Well, I personally think that there should be some gun control, but I also think that I have the right to bear arms to protect myself.
[00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:19.421]  That's how I feel.
[00:18:20.882 --> 00:18:26.303]  Um, I'm just not convinced that gun control would solve the problems because
[00:18:27.748 --> 00:18:34.111]  I mean if you take away guns from people then they're going to find other ways to kill people and obviously guns allow murder to a larger degree.
[00:18:35.732 --> 00:18:44.117]  But I think that freedom is one thing that is good for America and you have to deal with the repercussions of that sometimes.
[00:18:44.497 --> 00:18:47.178]  Tell us your view on the AK-47, the AR-15.
[00:18:47.258 --> 00:18:50.360]  It's a glorified .22 with a little bit more velocity.
[00:18:51.249 --> 00:18:51.709]  Big deal.
[00:18:51.949 --> 00:18:54.730]  I think all people that think black guns are scary are racist.
[00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.552]  Oh wow, so he's saying that it's triggering to people.
[00:18:57.752 --> 00:18:58.272]  That's right.
[00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:09.316]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.437 --> 00:19:12.097]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:15.759]  And to look at that threat, we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.439 --> 00:19:18.740]  What is the number one obstacle
[00:19:19.537 --> 00:19:27.204]  To human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type one civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet.
[00:19:28.845 --> 00:19:39.214]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.742 --> 00:19:50.145]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.

[00:23:03.436 --> 00:23:07.578]  The Lone Wolf narrative of the Orlando attack is being questioned once again.
[00:23:07.958 --> 00:23:12.781]  Now, new evidence has surfaced that there were multiple participants in the Orlando shooting.
[00:23:13.161 --> 00:23:24.486]  Now, on Wednesday, Katherine Harridge told The Kelly File that audio captured on cell phones during the attack revealed that Mateen was conversing with one or more people about tactics and he was not talking to 911.
[00:23:26.187 --> 00:23:34.732]  Megan, an investigative source says a lot of people inside the club were using their phones to record what was going on, even inside the bathroom where Omar Mateen took hostages.
[00:23:35.172 --> 00:23:45.818]  The source said the FBI is doing a forensic review of the phones, and audio was captured of Mateen, where he appears to be having a conversation about the attack, and he was not talking to 911.
[00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:54.483]  We don't know a lot more about what was said by Mateen, but the source said it was the kind of conversation you would have with someone who was familiar with what was going on.
[00:23:55.123 --> 00:24:08.089]  Now, Intellihub actually reported on this back on June 15th, and it was mentioned during an ABC interview with one of the victims, but of course it was scrubbed, never really went into that much further because, you know, eyewitness accounts.
[00:24:08.589 --> 00:24:19.073]  But this person said, during the interview, the eyewitness, who played dead for several hours during the attack as a strategy to stay alive, said that he had overheard a phone conversation that the shooter was engaged in.
[00:24:19.413 --> 00:24:22.835]  The eyewitness said that the shooter made mention that he was the fourth shooter
[00:24:23.315 --> 00:24:28.602]  And that there were 3 others, snipers, along with a female suicide bomber that was playing dead.
[00:24:29.143 --> 00:24:38.734]  So I could see how ABC might not want to run with what this witness said, but it'll be very interesting to find out just what was on those phones that were capturing the audio in that room.
[00:24:39.415 --> 00:24:44.197]  Now there are reports that another young man was arrested in Indiana.
[00:24:44.337 --> 00:24:50.400]  He's a teenager and he was arrested for trying to join ISIS and commit acts of terrorism here on U.S.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.020]  soil.
[00:24:51.801 --> 00:24:56.923]  This is Akram Musleh and he was arrested as he tried to board a Greyhound bus
[00:24:57.443 --> 00:24:57.523]  To
[00:25:15.131 --> 00:25:23.520]  We have these people who are going to call them homegrown terrorists, but obviously their ideology is being imported here to the West.
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.083]  They're getting radicalized online and then they're stupid enough to post about it.
[00:25:27.504 --> 00:25:31.748]  Although, of course, the FBI and other agencies appreciate it because it makes it easier to track.
[00:25:32.569 --> 00:25:41.194]  But this is what is coming out of this Senate committee report out of Senator Jeff Sessions office where he's talking about the fact that since 9-11 there have been 580 terror convictions here in the U.S.
[00:25:41.214 --> 00:25:42.934]  380 of those terrorists are foreign born so they are coming in from
[00:25:49.898 --> 00:26:00.282]  All sorts of countries where terrorism is rife, including Pakistan, Lebanon, Palestine, Somalia, Yemen, Iraq, Jordan, Egypt, Afghanistan.
[00:26:00.622 --> 00:26:05.864]  So they're coming in either illegally or via immigration, the U.S.
[00:26:05.884 --> 00:26:09.305]  government visa program, or the refugee programs.
[00:26:09.865 --> 00:26:13.866]  Many of them have come in, at least 24 admitted as refugees.
[00:26:14.467 --> 00:26:17.788]  But this is what they're trying to conflate with the no-fly list.
[00:26:18.408 --> 00:26:20.511]  They're saying that this is the terror watch list.
[00:26:20.551 --> 00:26:25.076]  Of course, they shouldn't be able to purchase guns, but it's not the terror watch list.
[00:26:25.256 --> 00:26:27.659]  It's the no-fly list that we're dealing with.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:34.907]  The Democrats staged another disgraceful publicity stunt in an effort to push for
[00:26:35.678 --> 00:26:37.939]  More gun control legislation.
[00:26:38.299 --> 00:26:46.584]  This time they occupied the House floor in a sit-in that lasted just over 25 hours.
[00:26:46.924 --> 00:26:48.805]  Rise up, Democrats!
[00:26:49.405 --> 00:26:51.166]  Rise up, Americans!
[00:26:51.746 --> 00:26:53.567]  This cannot stand!
[00:26:54.307 --> 00:26:56.889]  We will occupy this floor!
[00:26:57.489 --> 00:27:14.659]  How ironic is it that during the civil rights era back in the 1960s, these types of sit-ins took place as a method of asking for rights, but now modern-day Democrats are protesting to have our rights taken away.
[00:27:15.199 --> 00:27:17.340]  Welcome to the new America.
[00:27:17.741 --> 00:27:25.025]  Don't be fooled by the grandstanding, ladies and gentlemen, because this is pure political theater.
[00:27:25.942 --> 00:27:26.923]  I mean, think about it.
[00:27:27.203 --> 00:27:31.187]  Where were the Democrats during the Fast and Furious scandal?
[00:27:31.747 --> 00:27:44.840]  Did they filibuster or stage a sit-in when it became blatantly obvious that the Obama administration let thousands of automatic weapons fall into the hands of the Mexican drug cartels?
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:45.881]  Of course not!
[00:27:46.061 --> 00:27:50.345]  When were you first told or became knowledgeable about
[00:27:50.765 --> 00:27:51.025]  I don't know.
[00:27:51.045 --> 00:27:51.365]  I don't know.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:14.103]  And did they hold filibusters and press conferences when the Obama administration shipped U.S.
[00:28:14.143 --> 00:28:18.805]  military weapons to ISIS to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad?
[00:28:19.325 --> 00:28:20.806]  I didn't see a filibuster, did you?
[00:28:21.406 --> 00:28:26.688]  Because they don't want to talk about that, just like they don't want to talk about a sitting president
[00:28:27.208 --> 00:28:37.832]  Who is more interested in disarming Americans than he is in stopping the tsunami of radical Muslim refugees entering our country right now.
[00:28:38.332 --> 00:28:42.134]  And we're talking about extremists who want us dead.
[00:28:42.774 --> 00:28:50.600]  Meanwhile, the mainstream media's talking point this week has been the terrorist watch list.
[00:28:51.261 --> 00:28:59.147]  Because after all, we can all agree that terrorists should not have the ability to purchase firearms.
[00:28:59.927 --> 00:29:02.710]  People who are on the terrorist watch list here in the U.S.
[00:29:03.331 --> 00:29:05.653]  Who knew that they were still legally able to buy guns?
[00:29:05.994 --> 00:29:07.875]  There are 700,000 people on the U.S.
[00:29:07.915 --> 00:29:08.776]  terror watch list.
[00:29:09.017 --> 00:29:10.618]  Stuart, what the heck is up with this?
[00:29:10.939 --> 00:29:16.284]  People who are on the terrorist watch list, they can't fly, but they can go and buy guns and have been successful at doing so?
[00:29:16.564 --> 00:29:20.949]  I think if somebody has been watch listed, even if they're ultimately removed from the watch list,
[00:29:21.631 --> 00:29:23.473]  And they go to purchase an assault weapon.
[00:29:23.813 --> 00:29:26.976]  That ought to be enough to trigger the FBI to taking another look.
[00:29:27.316 --> 00:29:36.224]  You have something that just makes common sense around keeping terrorists away from buying guns, who are being investigated as being potential terrorists.
[00:29:36.684 --> 00:29:40.007]  But you still have this due process issue, and that's where the rub is.
[00:29:40.067 --> 00:29:47.994]  Whether, you know, you run up against particularly advocates of gun rights who think that the idea of the government keeping lists on Americans
[00:29:48.735 --> 00:29:50.536]  So, are you comfortable with that?
[00:30:07.694 --> 00:30:12.700]  And convicted and actually criminalized of conducting terrorist attacks or terrorist tendencies?
[00:30:12.941 --> 00:30:13.682]  You should be in jail!
[00:30:13.702 --> 00:30:14.603]  You should be on a list!
[00:30:14.643 --> 00:30:16.725]  Carl, isn't that a violation of someone's civil rights?
[00:30:16.785 --> 00:30:20.991]  Throw them in jail rather than just depriving them of access to guns?
[00:30:22.355 --> 00:30:23.176]  Well, both are right.
[00:30:23.236 --> 00:30:24.777]  So, Allison, where do you draw the line?
[00:30:25.097 --> 00:30:25.637]  Here's the deal.
[00:30:25.957 --> 00:30:33.442]  If you are on a terrorist, if you're on a terror watch list, or if you're on a no-fly list, you are allowed, because of the Republican Congress, to buy and collect firearms.
[00:30:33.582 --> 00:30:34.623]  Well, here's the problem.
[00:30:34.643 --> 00:30:45.189]  Besides the end of due process, we've already seen what happens when you end up being put on one of these government watch lists.
[00:30:45.389 --> 00:30:47.891]  I mean, millions of people are put on these lists.
[00:30:48.311 --> 00:30:51.293]  Most of them are law-abiding, good American citizens.
[00:30:51.887 --> 00:30:53.154]  And I'll give you a good example.
[00:30:53.931 --> 00:30:56.533]  This guy was on a government watch list.
[00:30:56.633 --> 00:31:07.162]  Martin Luther King Jr., who was a Republican, by the way, he would not be able to purchase a firearm if he were alive today and the Democrats got their way.
[00:31:07.843 --> 00:31:10.345]  And of course, I'm not just picking on the Democrats.
[00:31:10.445 --> 00:31:12.987]  After all, it was George W. Bush.
[00:31:13.447 --> 00:31:22.575]  He was the guy who originally, back in 2007, he was the president who wanted a no-fly list added to the no-buy list.
[00:31:22.975 --> 00:31:30.283]  So George W. wanted any American citizen who was on the TSA no-fly list kept from being able to purchase firearms.
[00:31:30.743 --> 00:31:34.327]  So it's not necessarily a left versus right issue.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:44.207]  And let me tell you something, if you dare go up against the system, you too might find yourself on the government terrorist watch list.
[00:31:44.768 --> 00:31:52.253]  And my question is, why would Drew Griffin's name come on the watch list post his investigation of TSA?
[00:31:52.754 --> 00:31:56.197]  What a curious and interesting and troubling phenomenon.
[00:31:57.193 --> 00:32:02.838]  What is the basis of this sudden recognition that Drew Griffin is a terrorist?
[00:32:03.438 --> 00:32:06.121]  Are we targeting people because of their critique or criticism?
[00:32:06.641 --> 00:32:14.788]  He may share the name with someone who was put on, and if he has a complaint about it, he ought to refer it over to the IG.
[00:32:24.963 --> 00:32:26.524]  And all you ISIS people threatening us?
[00:32:26.784 --> 00:32:28.245]  Hey, we're not a French newspaper.
[00:32:28.725 --> 00:32:28.945]  Okay?
[00:32:29.246 --> 00:32:32.107]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:32:32.307 --> 00:32:34.008]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:32:34.028 --> 00:32:35.329]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:36.370]  This is Texas.
[00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:37.411]  You want to threaten me?
[00:32:37.491 --> 00:32:38.591]  You can go straight to hell.
[00:32:38.631 --> 00:32:39.252]  You understand that?
[00:32:39.432 --> 00:32:45.155]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:32:45.615 --> 00:32:49.458]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:02.338 --> 00:33:11.541]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important area of InfoWars that runs the whole operation that is having such a big effect against the globalists.
[00:33:12.341 --> 00:33:19.984]  And I've said it over and over again, it is you the listeners and the viewers that send us the intel, the news tips, that support the broadcast, that spread the word.
[00:33:20.884 --> 00:33:23.985]  You are 90% of the operation or more.
[00:33:24.025 --> 00:33:27.146]  You don't stand beside us, you stand at the heart of InfoWars.
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.
[00:33:57.342 --> 00:34:05.626]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when products are sold out, you're unable to get them, sometimes for months, but we hold back the products for people that have already signed up for AutoShip.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:07.455 --> 00:37:15.759]  On the veto message of the President on House Joint Resolution 88, the Clerk will report the title of the joint resolution.
[00:37:19.042 --> 00:37:22.804]  The chaos on the floor was downright embarrassing.
[00:37:23.104 --> 00:37:40.253]  Steve Watson writes, as Democrats occupied the House Wednesday and staged a sit-in to push for action on gun control legislation, critics lambasted them for their actions, with one GOP rep calling the action a disgrace.
[00:37:40.674 --> 00:37:46.837]  Calling this a sit-in is a disgrace to Woolworths, Representative Mark Walker tweeted.
[00:37:47.037 --> 00:37:52.279]  Referring to the infamous civil rights protest sit-ins that took place in the 1960s.
[00:37:52.559 --> 00:38:01.983]  Walker noted that while those protesting back then were asking for rights, House Democrats are protesting to have rights taken away.
[00:38:02.423 --> 00:38:08.986]  The staged action began with Representative John Lewis giving a speech to the rest of the Democrats gathered.
[00:38:09.761 --> 00:38:17.044]  We cannot continue to stick our heads in the sand and ignore the reality of mass gun violence in our nation.
[00:38:18.205 --> 00:38:22.787]  Deadly mass shootings are becoming more and more frequent.
[00:38:24.528 --> 00:38:27.169]  Mr. Speaker, this is a fight.
[00:38:28.509 --> 00:38:29.490]  It is not an opinion.
[00:38:30.882 --> 00:38:32.364]  We must remove the blinders.
[00:38:32.785 --> 00:38:36.149]  The time for silence and patience is long gone.
[00:38:37.211 --> 00:38:44.220]  We're calling on the leadership of the House to bring common sense gun control legislation to the House floor.
[00:38:44.861 --> 00:38:45.963]  Give us a vote!
[00:38:46.863 --> 00:38:50.564]  The Democrats then all proceeded to sit down on the floor of the chamber.
[00:38:50.904 --> 00:38:58.126]  The lawmakers told reporters they would not move from the floor until House Republicans schedule a vote on gun control legislation.
[00:38:58.426 --> 00:39:05.648]  Cameras in the chamber were turned off and the House was declared in recess with Speaker Paul Ryan's entourage declaring,
[00:39:05.968 --> 00:39:06.308]  I'm good.
[00:39:22.944 --> 00:39:29.667]  While some Democrats accused Ryan of shutting off the cameras, the Post noted that it was done merely as a matter of procedure.
[00:39:30.047 --> 00:39:38.070]  The report also noted, when the tables were turned eight years ago and Republicans were doing a sit-in, both the cameras and the lights were also off.
[00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:47.404]  You know, in Washington, we can over-interpret these theatrical events and everything and kind of endow them with great significance, when in the long run, it probably won't matter much.
[00:39:47.424 --> 00:39:53.173]  I still believe in the Constitution, and I believe in the Second Amendment, but I'm for gun control.
[00:39:54.053 --> 00:40:02.279]  Where the real killing is going on is our guns and our military going overseas and bombing and killing and starting wars that aren't necessary.
[00:40:02.359 --> 00:40:11.766]  Is it any wonder why the disapproval of Congress' hypocrisy has reached record highs consecutively throughout Obama's reign in office?
[00:40:12.186 --> 00:40:19.712]  Apparently the socialist nightmare known as the Democratic Party felt it was high time to weigh in for their globalist overlords.
[00:40:20.012 --> 00:40:22.013]  Isn't it abundantly clear by now?
[00:40:22.234 --> 00:40:33.021]  The United Nations' desperation to disarm American citizens in order to reduce us into cannon fodder for the whims of the New World Order has never been more obvious.
[00:40:33.622 --> 00:40:35.083]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:40:48.044 --> 00:40:52.990]  So I started this talk a few minutes ago talking about what is a true awakening?
[00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:55.372]  What is true consciousness?
[00:40:57.174 --> 00:41:04.082]  And that's a complex question on the surface, but it's really simple when you look at it through a historical cultural lens.
[00:41:05.364 --> 00:41:06.085]  Consciousness
[00:41:07.717 --> 00:41:17.121]  Is our entire cultural genetic experience as a species stretching back into the midst of time through our instincts and through our genetics up until this point.
[00:41:17.661 --> 00:41:21.362]  The great lie is that we are just these alone individuals.
[00:41:21.842 --> 00:41:32.587]  We are individuals, but we carry with us the hopes, the dreams, the passions, the sins, but also the great works and the love of those that came before us.
[00:41:32.687 --> 00:41:33.167]  We are them.
[00:41:34.881 --> 00:41:40.466]  And we have that love of those in the past and that electric connection to the present focusing forward into the future.
[00:41:41.447 --> 00:41:53.539]  And when you don't have a sense of the space-time continuum, when you don't have a sense of the species and its journey and its mission, if you don't have a sense of believing in the species and believing in its survival and believing in its ascension,
[00:41:54.639 --> 00:41:57.962]  Then you have cut yourself off from what it is to be human.
[00:41:58.943 --> 00:42:11.773]  And that's the big globalist virus, is to make you cynical, to make you hateful, to never let you go through rites of passage when you're young, to never go through cultural rituals that are meant to release
[00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:17.231]  Chemical reactions in the brain that unlock race memories.
[00:42:17.991 --> 00:42:27.976]  Consciousness memories that are far beyond the vague limited statement of instincts and that allow you as a current sentient being
[00:42:29.056 --> 00:42:36.259]  To commune and experience all of the genetic wealth and history and thought and dreams of those before you.
[00:42:36.939 --> 00:42:47.923]  This is only one small part of the spectrum that is the wonder, that is this world of fantastical magic that we live in.
[00:42:49.895 --> 00:43:10.268]  And that's why they want us to fight over petty issues, why they want us to be emotional and dumb us down into these, you know, areas where language has been reduced to the point where it's all just about color and spectrum and where you're from or what you say and what you do instead of the real issues that are being discussed and debated.
[00:43:11.409 --> 00:43:12.209]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.411]  The globalists have seized control of the planet.
[00:43:16.792 --> 00:43:18.073]  They openly claim it's theirs.
[00:43:19.093 --> 00:43:19.974]  They're the technocrats.
[00:43:20.014 --> 00:43:27.960]  They're the hardcore, cold-blooded scientists that have decided this belongs to them because the general public is so dumbed down and so mindless.
[00:43:28.761 --> 00:43:43.372]  But their great sin, as I have said countless times, is that they have built a modern system and designed it to make people pliable, to make people passive, to make people stupid, to make people unfeeling, undreaming creatures.
[00:43:44.193 --> 00:43:45.214]  So that they can be managed.
[00:43:45.894 --> 00:43:57.800]  So how do you then turn back and look at the mass of humanity and say that they're a failed group who is deservant of extermination when you yourselves have set up a system to bring them down?
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:06.324]  And undoubtedly, everything that's been established in this great time of decadence is destroying the so-called elites themselves.
[00:44:07.776 --> 00:44:14.118]  They're not immune from the cultural and spiritual machinery that they've turned loose, that they've released.
[00:44:14.178 --> 00:44:31.582]  I mean, look at the oxymoronic paradigm of so-called liberals, like the Democratic Party and the Republican leadership to a certain extent as well, bringing in millions of radical Islamics all over Europe and the United States and then telling us we have to give up our freedoms so that we don't
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:32.920]  I think?
[00:44:50.806 --> 00:45:04.975]  All of this is the fault of the American gun owner when it's Hillary Clinton and her foundation and Obama and NATO and the French government and the Turkish government and others who've openly been funding with Saudi Arabia a global jihad.
[00:45:05.395 --> 00:45:16.903]  Saudi Arabia was only a few hundred square miles in 1901 in the middle of what's Saudi Arabia today with a kidnapping bank robber mob of flesh merchants known as the House of Saud
[00:45:18.112 --> 00:45:29.504]  A few hundred Bedouin robbers who then were given British intel and British money and turned loose to take over more than half of the Middle East, including Syria by the 1930s.
[00:45:30.785 --> 00:45:39.694]  And now we sit here and look at them launching their tentacles and building hundreds of mosques per country every year and controlling the leftist media who are a bunch of
[00:45:40.885 --> 00:45:42.885]  Unprincipled sellouts.
[00:45:43.385 --> 00:45:44.766]  They already sold out to corporations.
[00:45:44.786 --> 00:45:45.986]  They already sold out to globalists.
[00:45:46.186 --> 00:45:47.926]  They already sold out to technocracies.
[00:45:48.166 --> 00:45:49.807]  They already sold out the communist Chinese.
[00:45:50.127 --> 00:45:57.428]  So why not just go ahead and sell out to the Wahhabist who keep women as slaves and who are the most oppressive people on earth.
[00:45:59.368 --> 00:46:03.069]  And then we see Jakari Jackson, we'll play a clip of this, in Atlanta a few days ago.
[00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:09.490]  And he comes up and there's a black man wearing a rainbow flag talking in a classically stereotypical
[00:46:10.583 --> 00:46:12.404]  Affeminate voice.
[00:46:13.825 --> 00:46:15.466]  And I don't even dislike him because he does that.
[00:46:15.506 --> 00:46:17.847]  It's just that it's so standard and stereotypical.
[00:46:18.427 --> 00:46:25.671]  And he's bitching out some young black teenager man who's just simply there to support Donald Trump saying you're a racist.
[00:46:26.051 --> 00:46:30.794]  Donald Trump wanted to send black people back to Africa.
[00:46:31.454 --> 00:46:33.855]  And Donald Trump's family's KKK.
[00:46:34.376 --> 00:46:34.916]  All of that.
[00:46:35.216 --> 00:46:36.817]  Complete made up bull.
[00:46:37.117 --> 00:46:38.798]  Like saying that moon right up there.
[00:46:40.089 --> 00:46:40.990]  Why would you support a racist?
[00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:41.890]  Thank you.
[00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:42.711]  Thank you.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:07.462]  Get Brain Force at 25% off for a limited time at Infowarslife.com.
[00:47:07.602 --> 00:47:09.783]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.903 --> 00:47:16.706]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:16.946 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.408]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.989]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:47:47.029 --> 00:47:52.192]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:47:52.392 --> 00:47:53.013]  Or call 888-253-3139.

[00:47:55.754 --> 00:47:56.915]  And we thank you for your support.
[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.

[00:49:04.397 --> 00:49:10.003]  Well, if you don't watch InfoWars, you might not even know that an assassination attempt was made against Donald Trump.
[00:49:10.103 --> 00:49:16.109]  That's because it was barely mentioned, it was a blink-and-you'll-miss-it news story out there in all the mainstream media.
[00:49:16.489 --> 00:49:26.979]  Well, we have actually an NBC producer tweeting out that it could be argued that the dude who was hoping to assassinate Donald Trump is just a good guy with a gun.
[00:49:28.058 --> 00:49:29.058]  Are you kidding me?
[00:49:29.198 --> 00:49:34.740]  Can you imagine if this would have been a Trump supporter that had attempted to do this against Hillary Clinton?
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:36.540]  It would be everywhere.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.541]  They would be exploiting this story.
[00:49:38.901 --> 00:49:40.401]  It would still be going on in the news.
[00:49:40.481 --> 00:49:44.502]  CNN would probably do a 24 hour news broadcast breaking this down.
[00:49:45.162 --> 00:49:53.324]  It's just like when they had the guy run on stage a few months back and the Secret Service actually had to stop him from attacking Donald Trump.
[00:49:53.584 --> 00:49:55.645]  Do you think that they said this guy's a crazy loon?
[00:49:55.685 --> 00:49:56.945]  Oh my gosh, this is terrible.
[00:49:57.285 --> 00:50:05.848]  No, they actually rolled the guy out and gave him a prime time slot on the news to tell everyone why he wanted to punch Donald Trump in the face.
[00:50:06.248 --> 00:50:09.429]  Totally ridiculous, completely biased, insane.
[00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:19.472]  So of course, when Trump came out attacking Hillary Clinton this week, we have all of the media rallying around to prove that it was just a bunch of conspiracy theories.
[00:50:19.772 --> 00:50:20.732]  And of course, this is the
[00:50:21.712 --> 00:50:24.333]  This is the narrative that Clinton herself is pushing out.
[00:50:24.373 --> 00:50:28.055]  She said he's responding with outlandish lies and conspiracy theories.
[00:50:28.515 --> 00:50:34.157]  He's a reckless candidate with reckless ideas who's trying to distract the American public.
[00:50:34.618 --> 00:50:46.923]  No, he's trying to tell the American public everything that the media fails to explain to them and does a very good job of circling the wagons to try to protect you continually.
[00:50:47.683 --> 00:50:51.566]  And in fact, we have a reporter coming out of Slate.
[00:50:51.966 --> 00:50:58.891]  So we have the media actually agreeing with some of the things that Donald Trump was saying, agreeing that Hillary is funded by anti-gay regimes.
[00:50:59.411 --> 00:51:01.552]  So this is Slate's Jeremy Stahl.
[00:51:01.592 --> 00:51:10.558]  He confirmed that the Clinton Foundation indeed is raking in millions of dollars from regimes and anti-gay monarchs and other third world dictators.
[00:51:10.618 --> 00:51:14.381]  But he questioned whether it was a conflict of interest.
[00:51:14.881 --> 00:51:22.526]  He also failed to acknowledge the hypocrisy of Democratic candidates taking donations from countries that behead gays and stone women.
[00:51:23.087 --> 00:51:26.889]  But he goes on to say, you know, here at the Trump rally, it means more than that.
[00:51:27.009 --> 00:51:29.751]  It's a reason to throw Clinton behind bars.
[00:51:30.151 --> 00:51:36.576]  Now, I thought that was pretty funny because obviously he's seeing a lot of these Hillary for prison t-shirts that everyone is wearing at the Trump rallies.
[00:51:37.056 --> 00:51:39.277]  But that's not why people are calling for her imprisonment.
[00:51:39.498 --> 00:51:51.766]  They want to see her thrown in prison because of the presumptive violation of the Freedom of Information Act by setting up her own private homebrew server in the closet in her house, in her basement bathroom.
[00:51:52.086 --> 00:51:54.608]  Totally safe from foreign hackers, right?
[00:51:55.288 --> 00:52:06.694]  And of course that's probably why her IT staffer has had to plead the fifth 125 consecutive times because he doesn't want to incriminate himself.
[00:52:07.134 --> 00:52:13.337]  And then there's an article coming out of the Daily Mail how Clinton's server was wide open to hackers for weeks.
[00:52:13.897 --> 00:52:18.681]  And Huma Abedin actually was warning other officials not to use her secret address.
[00:52:18.721 --> 00:52:19.822]  These are new emails.
[00:52:20.162 --> 00:52:27.007]  They're revealing how her server had a technical problem so serious that its security systems were shut off.
[00:52:27.407 --> 00:52:34.573]  And then Huma Abedin emailed people, high-ranking staff, warning them, don't email HRC anything sensitive.
[00:52:34.813 --> 00:52:36.734]  I can explain more in person.
[00:52:38.155 --> 00:52:42.998]  You know, and obviously we've learned that later hackers did indeed get into that homebrew server.
[00:52:43.418 --> 00:52:45.660]  The Clinton camp still denies that it happened.
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:50.443]  And then, of course, we've got CNN's fact checkers coming out.
[00:52:50.983 --> 00:52:53.365]  This is Christina Alessi and Lori Frankel.
[00:52:54.105 --> 00:53:01.989]  They were fact-checking something coming out of the Clinton cash with Hillary Clinton's State Department approving the transfer of 20% of U.S.
[00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:08.892]  uranium to the Russian government as nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.
[00:53:09.372 --> 00:53:15.815]  And they were like, well, you know, we just couldn't find any evidence that there was some quid pro quo.
[00:53:15.935 --> 00:53:18.356]  And so we're going to just, we're going to claim that it's false.
[00:53:18.837 --> 00:53:18.997]  Well,
[00:53:19.657 --> 00:53:24.821]  Well, the New York Times had a 4,000-word front-page story written about a year ago.
[00:53:24.841 --> 00:53:38.793]  It was a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist who wrote it, and they had stunning detail, including charts and graphs laying out the flow of millions of dollars from the nine investors in the uranium deal who flowed $145 million to Hillary's family foundation.
[00:53:42.836 --> 00:53:47.061]  But you know what, it's false because the fact checkers at CNN said it was.
[00:53:47.402 --> 00:53:58.175]  And then of course we have the Chinese government who paid Bill Clinton massive speaking fees just 10 days before Hillary made her famous Asia pivot.
[00:53:58.635 --> 00:54:05.937]  So, you know, half a million dollars in quote-unquote speaking fees must have been some pretty awesome speeches out of Bill Clinton there.
[00:54:06.337 --> 00:54:14.300]  And then we also have her top Clinton aides actually mocking the fact that there was a donor appointed to a board who had absolutely no experience.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.621]  So just give Hillary a little bit of money and you'll get a cushy job there.
[00:54:19.042 --> 00:54:20.923]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:54:20.943 --> 00:54:26.986]  Now yesterday Donald Trump gave a speech really hammering a lot of the things that we already know about Hillary Clinton.
[00:54:27.366 --> 00:54:37.692]  He came out in a huge assault on the things that she's been involved in from Benghazi to the email scandals to her slogan being I'm with her.
[00:54:38.186 --> 00:54:41.109]  And Donald Trump coming back and saying, no, I'm with you, the American people.
[00:54:41.129 --> 00:54:47.356]  So what we're going to do is we're going to walk around, we're going to talk to people and ask them what they think about Donald Trump's speech yesterday on Hillary Clinton.
[00:54:47.656 --> 00:54:55.264]  Trump came out yesterday and said that she was a world-class liar because she was involved in email scandal, Benghazi, and she lied about coming under sniper fire in Bosnia.
[00:54:55.744 --> 00:54:57.206]  What are your thoughts about that statement?
[00:54:57.628 --> 00:54:59.932]  I think that Trump University speaks for everything.
[00:55:00.052 --> 00:55:03.016]  He's a failure at a lot of things and he likes to point out people's weaknesses.
[00:55:03.637 --> 00:55:04.218]  He's a bully.
[00:55:04.278 --> 00:55:06.602]  He's who our parents taught us to not be when we were younger.
[00:55:06.622 --> 00:55:08.024]  Yeah, I can't stand the guy.
[00:55:10.237 --> 00:55:15.879]  The scandals he spoke of, most of which I feel have been brought up before.
[00:55:16.899 --> 00:55:18.239]  Is Hillary the perfect candidate?
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:20.000]  I don't think so.
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:29.683]  However, when looking at the person who's slinging the accusations, I can't help but question whether or not it's the pot calling the kettle black.
[00:55:30.163 --> 00:55:32.724]  Well, I mean, I'm kind of with him on the whole lying aspect.
[00:55:32.764 --> 00:55:40.826]  I mean, since I've heard about Hillary from just being, you know, into politics at all, it's just been constant s*** that hasn't added up.
[00:55:41.326 --> 00:55:47.867]  But with Trump, I mean, he's uneducated himself, so I don't think he really has any room to talk about other than business for the company.
[00:55:47.887 --> 00:55:48.867]  That's exactly right.
[00:55:48.907 --> 00:55:49.288]  He doesn't.
[00:55:49.348 --> 00:55:53.549]  He's equally, if not more, of a liar than she is.
[00:55:53.569 --> 00:55:56.189]  Just because he's uneducated, I wouldn't say he's lying.
[00:55:56.249 --> 00:55:58.070]  I'd say he doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:55:58.110 --> 00:55:58.410]  There you go.
[00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:59.510]  Okay, that's probably better.
[00:55:59.915 --> 00:56:19.834]  Aside from the details which are difficult to sort through, I think that the reality is that when you can have a conversation like that about somebody, and there's even the remote possibility that it could be true, then that indicates that there's a real problem, right?
[00:56:21.122 --> 00:56:32.384]  You have to go through a lot of stuff to figure out what the various details are, but she's not above reproach on any of those accusations, and that by itself is problematic.
[00:56:32.584 --> 00:56:34.005]  So what do you think about Hillary Clinton?
[00:56:35.345 --> 00:56:36.545]  I don't really think anything.
[00:56:36.565 --> 00:56:38.486]  I don't think I want to, I'm sorry.
[00:56:40.246 --> 00:56:41.466]  I wouldn't want to talk about her either.
[00:56:42.086 --> 00:56:42.566]  She's evil.
[00:56:42.887 --> 00:56:43.787]  What are your thoughts on Hillary?
[00:56:44.447 --> 00:56:44.847]  On Hillary?
[00:56:44.907 --> 00:56:46.007]  I'm a Hillary supporter.
[00:56:46.907 --> 00:56:47.427]  And why is that?
[00:56:50.684 --> 00:56:56.006]  What do you think about Hillary Clinton?
[00:56:57.586 --> 00:56:58.026]  She's alright.
[00:56:59.267 --> 00:57:00.127]  What's alright about her?
[00:57:01.107 --> 00:57:04.709]  I don't see anything terrible about her.
[00:57:05.289 --> 00:57:06.349]  I'm voting for her.
[00:57:06.529 --> 00:57:08.730]  What do you think about Hillary Clinton?
[00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:11.791]  From the information I have, I wouldn't want her as president.
[00:57:13.199 --> 00:57:19.564]  Yesterday, Trump said Hillary ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund, doing favors for oppressive regimes for cash.
[00:57:19.584 --> 00:57:20.865]  What do you think about that statement?
[00:57:23.507 --> 00:57:23.848]  I don't know.
[00:57:23.888 --> 00:57:36.177]  I mean, I think there's, you know, there's definitely a culture of sort of taking in, you know, money from powerful interests, whether they be Wall Street interests, whether they be, you know, foreign governments or
[00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:41.751]  Trump said that Hillary Clinton ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund, doing favors for oppressive regimes for cash.
[00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:05.570]  No, I don't buy that.
[00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:17.293]  Now, she comes out and she says she's a feminist, she's pro-woman, but she takes money from Saudi Arabia who make women cover themselves, they chop their heads off in the streets, kill homosexuals, things like that.
[00:58:17.493 --> 00:58:18.913]  Yeah, it's absolutely absurd.
[00:58:19.093 --> 00:58:24.674]  I mean, they're both the absolute worst possible... I mean, think about what Canada's saying about our election right now.
[00:58:25.154 --> 00:58:26.214]  They're laughing at us.
[00:58:26.635 --> 00:58:28.915]  Everybody's laughing at us right now because it's a freaking joke.
[00:58:28.935 --> 00:58:30.055]  What do you think about Hillary Clinton?
[00:58:30.795 --> 00:58:31.736]  I'm voting for her.
[00:58:32.656 --> 00:58:32.856]  What?
[00:58:32.916 --> 00:58:33.176]  Really?
[00:58:33.596 --> 00:58:33.876]  Why?
[00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:36.799]  Uh, well, you know, I see.
[00:58:36.899 --> 00:58:39.840]  I honestly don't have time for this, but good luck to you, you know.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:40.840]  Because of my t-shirt?
[00:58:42.981 --> 00:58:52.004]  For prison, it's pretty, uh... It's a pretty aggressive stance, especially considering Trump's also being investigated for fraud for Trump U, so... Yeah, but one's FBI.
[00:58:52.944 --> 00:58:54.385]  Well, lesser of two evils, in my opinion.
[00:58:56.005 --> 00:58:57.166]  Well, that's it for the show tonight.
[00:58:57.226 --> 00:59:00.947]  Thank you for tuning in, and we will see you here again tomorrow at 7 p.m.
