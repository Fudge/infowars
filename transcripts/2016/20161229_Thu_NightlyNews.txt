[00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:21.932]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.992 --> 00:00:24.013]  It's December 29th, 2016.
[00:00:24.193 --> 00:00:25.253]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:00:25.473 --> 00:00:26.754]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:44.922]  Tonight, George Soros, the globalist Nazi collaborator, calls Donald Trump Hitler and says it is Trump, the would-be dictator, who threatens the future of the New World Order.
[00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:52.532]  Then, ISIS says they will infiltrate the US by masquerading as Muslim refugees.
[00:00:52.932 --> 00:00:59.795]  US intelligence sources agree the Great Trojan Horse will be the refugee crisis in America.
[00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:08.859]  And we now have them in our country, and wait till you see, this is going to be the Great Trojan Horse, and wait till you see what happens in the coming years.
[00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:11.000]  So why does Obama want
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.702]  More refugees.
[00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:20.050]  And why the hell is the Obama administration arming and training radical Muslim terrorists in Syria?
[00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:23.815]  You'll find out up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:06.538]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, there was a ton that we have to cover in the news today.
[00:03:06.578 --> 00:03:07.918]  We're going to knock out some of the stories.
[00:03:08.058 --> 00:03:12.821]  Then I'm going to get into some of the details that I believe Barack Obama is guilty of treason with.
[00:03:13.102 --> 00:03:18.565]  And then at the end of the show, we're going to talk about the Russian interference or the lack thereof.
[00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:20.746]  And also we're here from Alex Jones.
[00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:24.749]  He's got a special report about what George Soros had to say about Donald Trump.
[00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:29.750]  But here's some of the headlines that we'll touch on real quick before we get into any of that.
[00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.191]  This is from the New York Times.
[00:03:31.251 --> 00:03:35.072]  National Biotechnology Panel Faces New Conflict of Interest Questions.
[00:03:35.372 --> 00:03:39.173]  And there's a graphic on this story that kind of breaks it down so you can understand it better.
[00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:45.214]  But the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine are assigned by Congress to provide policy guidance to the government.
[00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:48.455]  The group describes itself as the advisors to the nation.
[00:03:48.815 --> 00:03:52.378]  One of those committees is facing questions about how its members were selected.
[00:03:52.718 --> 00:03:59.122]  Critics say that several committee members have financial ties to biotech businesses that could color the panel's report.
[00:03:59.723 --> 00:04:00.843]  Hmm.
[00:04:01.204 --> 00:04:02.445]  Hmm.
[00:04:02.465 --> 00:04:06.347]  Does that remind you of Monsanto and the FDA at all?
[00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:09.930]  You might want to check the conflict of interest between those two groups.
[00:04:11.307 --> 00:04:12.168]  This is another story.
[00:04:12.188 --> 00:04:15.029]  This is kind of one that has been developing for years, I suppose.
[00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:20.231]  Argentine court revives bombing cover-up case against former President Fernandez.
[00:04:20.512 --> 00:04:30.536]  An Argentine appeals court on Thursday revived a case accusing former President Fernandez for trying to cover up Iran's alleged role in the bombing of Buenos Aires Jewish Center in 1994.
[00:04:30.997 --> 00:04:37.840]  The prosecutor who first brought the allegation, Alberto Nisman, died mysteriously in January of last year.
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:47.264]  Nisman's death was initially classified as suicide, but an official investigation into the case said earlier this year the evidence points to homicide.
[00:04:47.804 --> 00:04:48.864]  So how do you like that?
[00:04:48.964 --> 00:04:55.447]  It's not like we ever see these suicides or alleged suicides look like they might be something different.
[00:04:55.507 --> 00:05:00.169]  So we'll keep an eye on what's going on with the former president of Argentina and the covering up of that bombing.
[00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:04.871]  France raises terror tax to support victims of attacks.
[00:05:04.911 --> 00:05:06.672]  This has to be one of the most unreal things I've ever heard.
[00:05:07.032 --> 00:05:20.078]  French citizens will contribute an extra 1.6 euros, that's just about $1.67, on their property insurance policies to help finance a fund for victims of the extremist attacks that have recently hit the country.
[00:05:20.118 --> 00:05:20.559]  That's right.
[00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:21.939]  Watch what you wear.
[00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:23.280]  Watch what you say.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.382]  Don't celebrate Christmas.
[00:05:25.682 --> 00:05:27.023]  Carry around a rape whistle.
[00:05:27.303 --> 00:05:30.927]  Wear your special bracelet that says you don't want to be raped.
[00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:33.289]  And now, pay us a tax.
[00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:37.113]  That's how we're going to stop the extremist violence going on in Europe.
[00:05:37.573 --> 00:05:39.975]  We're going to keep letting the extremist violent people in.
[00:05:40.536 --> 00:05:43.078]  You need to be tolerant and adjust your lifestyle.
[00:05:43.398 --> 00:05:43.839]  And you know what?
[00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:45.621]  Pay us a little money for the trouble too.
[00:05:46.724 --> 00:05:52.849]  Turkey's Erdogan rushes Putin-held talks over phone about the Syria ceasefire.
[00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.132]  So, Putin, Erdogan talking on the phone.
[00:05:57.592 --> 00:05:58.893]  They agree to a ceasefire.
[00:05:59.033 --> 00:06:00.454]  What's missing from this picture?
[00:06:00.655 --> 00:06:01.215]  Oh yeah!
[00:06:01.735 --> 00:06:03.277]  Barack Obama!
[00:06:04.452 --> 00:06:04.993]  Missing!
[00:06:05.914 --> 00:06:06.615]  MIA!
[00:06:07.235 --> 00:06:10.559]  Not involved in the ceasefire talks!
[00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:11.380]  What do you know?
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.041]  Wow!
[00:06:12.161 --> 00:06:18.648]  Shocking that Putin and Erdogan would want to keep Obama out of the talks to bring about a ceasefire and then they're successful!
[00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:21.290]  What does that tell you about Barack Obama, folks?
[00:06:21.971 --> 00:06:23.652]  What does this tell you about Barack Obama?
[00:06:24.252 --> 00:06:31.217]  Eight years of Obama vacations cost the taxpayers $85 million.
[00:06:31.277 --> 00:06:32.098]  That's right, folks.
[00:06:32.138 --> 00:06:35.260]  And that's not just Barack Obama and his family.
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.202]  That's also his extended family and friends.
[00:06:38.482 --> 00:06:46.747]  That's also the personal chef of Michelle and her family, her mother, everybody else, the person that does her manicures, everybody that flies around with the Obamas.
[00:06:47.028 --> 00:06:47.628]  That's nice.
[00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:52.792]  $85 million of our money towards the Obamas' vacation.
[00:06:52.852 --> 00:07:02.498]  Now they actually think that this is going to be closer to $100 million by the end of his final term as president, and once they actually collect all the fees.
[00:07:02.538 --> 00:07:03.699]  So that's nice.
[00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:14.884]  It'll be interesting to see, you know, Donald Trump seems to be someone who wants to stay at his own resorts, go to his own places, so maybe we're not going to be spending $100 million on vacations for Donald Trump, but I guess time will tell.
[00:07:15.004 --> 00:07:16.985]  Now, back to Obama, folks.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.462]  I have a litany of news here.
[00:07:20.542 --> 00:07:30.349]  These are puzzle pieces, and I'm going to try to put together a puzzle of what I believe is acts of treason against this country perpetrated by our President Barack Obama.
[00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:32.050]  Now, this is part of the U.S.
[00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.293]  Code, Chapter 115, Treason, Sedition, and Subversive Activities.
[00:07:36.353 --> 00:07:42.018]  Unfortunately, I can't get to all this because of time restraints, but here are some of the main ones that I'm going to read from the U.S.
[00:07:42.078 --> 00:07:46.321]  Code, and then we're going to put it together with what Obama has done here over the years.
[00:07:46.741 --> 00:07:49.664]  This is 2381 in this chapter.
[00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:50.265]  Treason.
[00:07:50.645 --> 00:08:03.199]  Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.302]  So we'll get into maybe some of that from Obama.
[00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:27.246]  This is 2383, rebellion or insurrection, whoever incites, sets foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, that's we the people folks, or gives aid or comfort to anyone who would be engaging in rebellion or insurrection against we the people.
[00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:30.648]  This is from 2385, advocating overthrow of the government.
[00:08:31.008 --> 00:08:49.490]  Whoever with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any such government prints, publishes, edits, issues, circulates, sells, distributes, or publicly displays any written or printed matter advocating, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence
[00:08:50.589 --> 00:09:12.054]  Or by written or printed matter, the NDAA, against We The People, whoever organizes or helps or attempts to organize any society, group, or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any such government by force or violence, Black Lives Matter, because becomes or is a member or affiliated with any such group or assembly of persons knowing the purposes thereof,
[00:09:13.067 --> 00:09:13.547]  Is guilty.
[00:09:13.627 --> 00:09:29.576]  The term organize and organize, organizes and organize, with respect to any society, group, or assembly thereof, persons, include the recruiting of new members, the forming of new units, and the regrouping or expansion of these existing corporations.
[00:09:29.616 --> 00:09:33.258]  Now this is something that George Soros is a master of, folks.
[00:09:33.638 --> 00:09:39.001]  And then 2389, recruiting for service against the United States.
[00:09:39.321 --> 00:09:45.140]  Whoever recruits soldiers or sailors within the United States or any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof...
[00:09:46.075 --> 00:09:50.856]  To engage in armed hostility against the United States is guilty and shall be punished.
[00:09:50.936 --> 00:09:53.736]  So, now I'm gonna tell, now that's just a few things.
[00:09:54.076 --> 00:09:56.237]  I couldn't get to all of this because of time restraints, like I said.
[00:09:56.277 --> 00:10:00.037]  But now, why would I feel like Obama might be guilty of some of that?
[00:10:00.097 --> 00:10:01.658]  Why do I feel like some of this is going on?
[00:10:01.678 --> 00:10:03.778]  And this is obviously a lot of convoluted stuff.
[00:10:04.158 --> 00:10:04.578]  But you know what?
[00:10:04.658 --> 00:10:06.058]  I'm gonna try to paint a picture here.
[00:10:06.218 --> 00:10:10.259]  I'm gonna try to put this puzzle together and maybe it'll make sense at the end.
[00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:11.859]  So let's start here.
[00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:14.460]  Now some of these stories are old, some of these stories are new.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.002]  Let's start with a story from June earlier this year.
[00:10:17.462 --> 00:10:18.603]  CIA Director.
[00:10:19.164 --> 00:10:22.727]  ISIS is trying to infiltrate the US through refugee programs.
[00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:30.454]  CIA Director John Brennan said that ISIS is training operatives and attempting to enter the US through refugee flows, smuggling routes, and legitimate methods of travel.
[00:10:30.715 --> 00:10:32.857]  This announcement comes as President Obama
[00:10:33.297 --> 00:10:38.761]  Pushes to reach his goal bringing in at least 10,000 additional Syrian refugees to the U.S.
[00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:40.022]  this year.
[00:10:40.382 --> 00:10:48.447]  In order to accomplish this objective, the Obama administration has reduced the screening process for Syrian refugees from 18 to 24 months, just down to three!
[00:10:48.827 --> 00:10:53.391]  This change was made despite a warning from FBI Director James Comey that said the U.S.
[00:10:53.431 --> 00:10:56.833]  does not have the ability to thoroughly screen Syrian refugees.
[00:10:59.511 --> 00:11:00.011]  Interesting.
[00:11:00.071 --> 00:11:04.715]  Why would Obama be bringing them in despite the violence and the warnings from the CIA?
[00:11:04.735 --> 00:11:06.796]  How about maybe he wants to listen to ISIS?
[00:11:06.836 --> 00:11:08.677]  Maybe he likes them more.
[00:11:08.998 --> 00:11:09.718]  ISIS smuggler!
[00:11:09.998 --> 00:11:13.681]  We will use refugee crisis to infiltrate West.
[00:11:13.701 --> 00:11:16.703]  4,000 covert terrorists already in place awaiting orders.
[00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:18.524]  Author Robert Spencer wrote
[00:11:19.685 --> 00:11:25.712]  Earlier this year for Front Page Magazine, this is no longer just a refugee crisis, this is Hijra.
[00:11:26.013 --> 00:11:30.018]  Hijra is the Islamic doctrine of migration, which is a form of stealth jihad.
[00:11:30.618 --> 00:11:38.668]  And he quotes the Quran, and whoever immigrates for the cause of Allah will find on the earth many locations and abundance.
[00:11:39.454 --> 00:11:44.139]  And whoever leaves his home is an immigrant to Allah and his messenger and then death overtakes him.
[00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:51.347]  His reward has already become incumbent upon Allah and Allah is never forgiving and ever forgiving and merciful.
[00:11:51.547 --> 00:11:57.433]  But Obama wants to bring these people into our country despite the warnings from the CIA, from ISIS.
[00:11:58.354 --> 00:12:05.820]  He doesn't have a problem, because look, Obama administration is bringing in refugees at a higher rate even after Trump got elected.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:11.684]  They were already bringing them in at an astronomical rate, and then on November 9th, he increases that rate again!
[00:12:11.704 --> 00:12:12.084]  Again!
[00:12:14.426 --> 00:12:16.908]  So again, is this treason against the country?
[00:12:16.968 --> 00:12:20.331]  You know that ISIS is infiltrating these people.
[00:12:20.351 --> 00:12:25.014]  You've been warned by multiple sources, yet you want more of them here.
[00:12:25.775 --> 00:12:28.377]  Is that not treason, I ask you?
[00:12:29.578 --> 00:12:32.260]  Now, let's move on to another angle.
[00:12:33.539 --> 00:12:35.801]  Again, some of this is old news but we're trying to paint a picture here.
[00:12:35.902 --> 00:12:38.805]  Obama proposes $500 million to aid Syrian rebels.
[00:12:39.185 --> 00:12:42.909]  Program to train and equip moderate opposition would expand U.S.
[00:12:42.989 --> 00:12:44.791]  role in civil war in Syria.
[00:12:45.623 --> 00:12:47.203]  Well, there's so much double standard here.
[00:12:47.264 --> 00:12:48.024]  First of all, it's hilarious.
[00:12:48.324 --> 00:13:01.348]  So it's okay for the United States to assume a role in a civil war in Syria, in putting bombs and weapons into that region, but it's not okay for Russia to allegedly hack John Podesta and the DNC's emails to expose corruption.
[00:13:01.708 --> 00:13:08.050]  We don't mind getting involved in Syrian civil wars, but God forbid Russia allegedly hacks corruption within the United States.
[00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:12.272]  CIA arms for Syrian rebels supplied into the black market!
[00:13:12.913 --> 00:13:19.516]  So these weapons and everything that Obama is putting into that region ends up in the hands of ISIS or ends up on the black market.
[00:13:19.536 --> 00:13:24.719]  This is according to officials in the Jordan Intelligence Agencies and the Central Intelligence Agencies.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:33.885]  The weapons shipped into that region by the United States and Saudi Arabia intended for Syrian rebels, ISIS, has ended up on the black market.
[00:13:34.565 --> 00:13:41.886]  Some of the stolen weapons were used in a shooting that killed two Americans at a police training facility in Jordan.
[00:13:43.174 --> 00:13:47.256]  So there's Obama's, the Obama administration sends weapons and then they kill Americans.
[00:13:47.656 --> 00:13:48.777]  How is that not treason?
[00:13:49.197 --> 00:13:54.239]  ISIS, video, America's airdropped weapons, now in our hands.
[00:13:54.439 --> 00:14:03.344]  A new video, ISIS shows American made weapons, it says were intended for the Kurds but actually were airdropped into the territory that was occupied by ISIS.
[00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:11.688]  Again, these are old stories, you've already heard all this, but we're just trying to put it together and then I'm trying to make the link to treason against this country via our president.
[00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.012]  More weapons found in eastern Aleppo left by moderate rebels.
[00:14:31.022 --> 00:14:39.405]  Discovered a new depot stacked with all types of weapons, hand grenades, tanks, guns, later laser-guided missiles, billions of dollars, and where did all this came from?
[00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:41.726]  That is good enough for several years of war.
[00:14:41.966 --> 00:14:43.646]  We know exactly where it came from.
[00:14:44.026 --> 00:14:47.107]  This was the moderate rebels that Obama was arming.
[00:14:47.367 --> 00:14:49.648]  Yeah, ISIS extremists.
[00:14:50.288 --> 00:14:53.830]  Russia, mass graves full of tortured civilians discovered in Aleppo.
[00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:54.670]  This is another new one.
[00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:07.005]  So the same area in Eastern Aleppo where they found the Western provided weapons, they have now found mass graves of tortured human beings.
[00:15:08.627 --> 00:15:08.887]  Okay?
[00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:14.215]  So, don't sit here and tell me about Russian influence in our election.
[00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:19.380]  We've got a president that can now have his hands all over tortured people in Syria.
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:20.341]  Excuse me.
[00:15:20.762 --> 00:15:21.622]  And now here's more.
[00:15:22.443 --> 00:15:24.966]  WikiLeaks confirms Hillary gives ISIS weapons.
[00:15:25.046 --> 00:15:28.730]  Fact check, Obama and Hillary, the founders of ISIS, you bet, you can decide that.
[00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:32.073]  I think it's a little more convoluted than to put it that simply, but folks, again,
[00:15:33.208 --> 00:15:35.629]  You cannot deny what happened in Syria.
[00:15:35.669 --> 00:15:48.093]  You cannot deny that the Obama administration has been sending funding and weapons into that region that has been destabilized, and now we're finding out that those very weapons were used to kill Americans and torture people!
[00:15:50.734 --> 00:15:51.774]  It doesn't even stop there.
[00:15:52.955 --> 00:15:56.296]  The treasonous president doesn't even stop there.
[00:15:59.025 --> 00:16:00.647]  The Black Lives Matter kills list.
[00:16:00.767 --> 00:16:05.832]  At least 11 cops shot dead, 9 more wounded by Black Lives Matter supporters.
[00:16:06.453 --> 00:16:11.839]  Not to mention all the violence, all the protests, all the arrests, all the racial tension that has come from this.
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.222]  This has not been good for America.
[00:16:15.363 --> 00:16:25.314]  Beyond any issues you want to mention about police or racial issues, this has not been good for racial issues, this has not been good for police, this has not been good for anyone.
[00:16:25.434 --> 00:16:31.201]  It's resulted in many people dying, it's resulted in racial tensions being worse in this country, but
[00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:34.248]  You know, has Obama done anything about this?
[00:16:34.308 --> 00:16:35.569]  We'll touch on that in a minute.
[00:16:35.969 --> 00:16:37.691]  But again, this is Obama's real legacy.
[00:16:38.111 --> 00:16:41.755]  A spike in ambush-style attacks against police officers.
[00:16:41.815 --> 00:16:46.840]  So far this year, 20 law enforcement officers have died in planned assaults carried out by gunmen.
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.663]  This is the highest number in at least a decade.
[00:16:52.185 --> 00:16:52.965]  And that would be...
[00:16:53.939 --> 00:16:55.641]  The Obama administration.
[00:16:56.341 --> 00:17:04.088]  Many rank-and-file officers say the protest and public outcry over police shootings have given rise to a national climate where some people feel justified in attacking officers.
[00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:04.909]  Of course!
[00:17:05.289 --> 00:17:12.636]  When you've got the mainstream news justifying them, when you've got Barack Obama justifying them, what do you think is going to happen?
[00:17:13.777 --> 00:17:17.741]  Black Lives Matter activists join Obama at Forum on Policing.
[00:17:19.497 --> 00:17:25.161]  What do you think is going to happen when Black Lives Matter, again, not everybody involved in the Black Lives Matter movement is bad.
[00:17:25.201 --> 00:17:26.162]  I'm not sitting here saying that.
[00:17:26.282 --> 00:17:33.547]  I'm sitting here and looking at an overall scope of what is going on, who's funding it, what has come from this movement, and it's not good.
[00:17:33.827 --> 00:17:34.708]  It's not good to me.
[00:17:36.064 --> 00:17:37.385]  And what do you think is going to happen?
[00:17:37.405 --> 00:17:47.849]  These people are in the streets chanting no justice, no peace, chanting kill police, and then you're going to put these people and have their voice heard at a forum on policing?
[00:17:48.469 --> 00:17:51.190]  That's like bringing police officers to that forum that just chant...
[00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.071]  We want dead citizens.
[00:17:53.392 --> 00:17:54.552]  We want dead people.
[00:17:54.612 --> 00:17:56.414]  We want dead immigrants or something like that.
[00:17:56.434 --> 00:17:57.295]  No, you wouldn't do that.
[00:17:57.355 --> 00:17:58.175]  That's absurd.
[00:17:58.396 --> 00:17:59.376]  So why are you doing it the other way?
[00:17:59.617 --> 00:18:02.659]  Prominent Black Lives Matter activists who attend Obama meeting.
[00:18:03.019 --> 00:18:12.087]  Prominent Black Lives Matter activist DeRay McKesson said Wednesday he is attending a meeting with President Obama designed to help men fray ties between law enforcement and the communities they serve.
[00:18:12.787 --> 00:18:13.348]  Here's an idea.
[00:18:13.728 --> 00:18:14.789]  Quit breaking the law.
[00:18:15.769 --> 00:18:16.970]  Quit starting protests.
[00:18:17.978 --> 00:18:19.220]  Let the police do their job.
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.061]  And I understand.
[00:18:20.782 --> 00:18:31.234]  Look, if there is a police officer who has wronged you, if there is a police officer who is out of hand, you have the law, you have the court, you can file suit, and you can do something about it.
[00:18:31.655 --> 00:18:32.956]  These protests have done nothing.
[00:18:33.457 --> 00:18:36.060]  And by the way, Obama met with three hours with these people.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:46.126]  Didn't meet for one minute with the flood victims in LA or in Louisiana, but he'll meet for three hours with the Black Lives Matter people who chant, no more racist police, kill the police in the streets.
[00:18:46.326 --> 00:18:47.427]  How do you think that went?
[00:18:47.467 --> 00:18:51.530]  So I ask you, America, do you think Barack Obama is guilty of treason?
[00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.271]  I think you should check the US code.
[00:19:01.976 --> 00:19:02.817]  Three years ago,
[00:19:03.752 --> 00:19:16.407]  The Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act repealed the law that had been on the books for decades, barring the CIA and other agencies from engaging in domestic propaganda and disinformation.
[00:19:17.734 --> 00:19:36.358]  Over the weekend, they passed the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act that funds 160 plus million dollars to this new organization that will, quote, discover and counter with its own disinformation, alternative media that they dub fake news.
[00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:52.010]  At the very same time, we see mainstream media claiming that Trump, myself, Tucker Carlson, you name it, are Russian agents, and that the American people really wanted Hillary Clinton, but the Russians somehow hacked in, and that's why Trump won.
[00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:56.173]  Yes, we've gotten Trump elected, but they're openly trying to overthrow that.
[00:19:57.034 --> 00:20:00.379]  Now more than ever, InfoWars needs your prayers and your support.
[00:20:00.439 --> 00:20:06.106]  And I need you to take the articles and the videos that are on the site and realize you're the reason we're having such an effect.
[00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:07.948]  You're the power of InfoWars.
[00:20:08.329 --> 00:20:12.574]  Get those articles, get those videos, get those special reports out to everyone you know.
[00:20:13.869 --> 00:20:22.471]  As we approach Christmas, and I'm supposed to say that word now, our country's under such incredible thought police tyranny, it's important to be thankful.
[00:20:22.612 --> 00:20:34.215]  And I am extremely thankful to all of you that have prayed for us, that have spread the word about the broadcast, that have supported us, that have defended us, and that have financially supported us.

[00:22:17.057 --> 00:22:21.858]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:22:22.018 --> 00:22:27.499]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.

[00:22:46.202 --> 00:22:49.163]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.

[00:22:56.804 --> 00:22:58.785]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:23:28.106 --> 00:23:30.126]  It was a tremendous threat of evil.
[00:23:30.206 --> 00:23:33.027]  I mean, it was a very personal experience of evil.
[00:23:34.447 --> 00:23:42.689]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours, who swore that you were his adopted god's son.
[00:23:42.969 --> 00:23:43.949]  Yes, yes.
[00:23:44.109 --> 00:23:47.530]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:48.210]  That's right.
[00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:57.572]  I mean, that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years.
[00:23:58.293 --> 00:23:59.094]  Was it difficult?
[00:24:01.479 --> 00:24:02.862]  Not at all.
[00:24:03.303 --> 00:24:09.095]  It was actually probably the happiest year of my life, that year of German occupation.
[00:24:12.458 --> 00:24:25.253]  So George Soros would like to have you believe that he's a kind, generous benefactor who gives money to good, righteous groups, and helps the children, and makes sure that everyone has a voice and is safe in a democratic society.
[00:24:25.833 --> 00:24:28.877]  He loves everyone, except those evil right-wingers.
[00:24:29.538 --> 00:24:30.459]  Except for one thing.
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.221]  That's a complete lie.
[00:24:33.069 --> 00:24:33.849]  And I'm going to tell you why.
[00:24:34.449 --> 00:24:42.451]  Soros is, in fact, one of the leading causes of global disruption on a scale like we've never seen before in a modern society.
[00:24:42.731 --> 00:24:52.093]  He funds countless left-wing extremist groups such as Black Lives Matter and MoveOn.org that cause problems and assault peaceful people who are just trying to get their opinion out.
[00:24:53.033 --> 00:24:58.594]  He openly admits that he caused the revolution in Ukraine and destabilized the Middle East.
[00:24:59.793 --> 00:25:06.756]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent of Russia.
[00:25:07.996 --> 00:25:11.858]  And the foundation has been functioning ever since.
[00:25:12.538 --> 00:25:16.220]  And it played an important part in events now.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:31.543]  Soros is also an admitted Nazi collaborator who happily recalls the days that his town was under Nazi occupation and he gladly helped his godfather round up the Jews and send them to prison camps.
[00:25:32.643 --> 00:25:41.385]  You're a Hungarian Jew who escaped the Holocaust by posing as a Christian.
[00:25:41.605 --> 00:25:41.825]  Right.
[00:25:44.795 --> 00:25:48.180]  You watched lots of people get shipped off to the death camps.
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:48.460]  Right.
[00:25:49.061 --> 00:25:50.203]  I was 14 years old.
[00:25:51.064 --> 00:25:53.568]  And I would say that that's when my character was made.
[00:25:53.991 --> 00:25:57.393]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[00:25:57.553 --> 00:25:57.994]  That's right.
[00:25:58.474 --> 00:26:00.676]  It created no problem at all.
[00:26:00.716 --> 00:26:01.616]  No feeling of guilt?
[00:26:02.017 --> 00:26:02.197]  No.
[00:26:02.757 --> 00:26:05.959]  How can someone like this be trusted in any country?
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:11.023]  This is truly chilling, especially since this man has so much sway and power across the globe.
[00:26:11.863 --> 00:26:19.609]  He funded Obama's campaign, and Hillary's as well, which is why maybe he's upset, because now we have someone in office that won't listen to him.
[00:26:20.731 --> 00:26:22.412]  Trump didn't receive any money from Soros.
[00:26:22.532 --> 00:26:23.593]  Soros doesn't own him.
[00:26:23.633 --> 00:26:24.513]  He doesn't have any power.
[00:26:24.533 --> 00:26:25.454]  He doesn't have any sway.
[00:26:25.934 --> 00:26:28.335]  Maybe that's why he's coming out openly against Trump.
[00:26:28.855 --> 00:26:32.117]  Soros was not happy about Trump getting elected, okay?
[00:26:32.397 --> 00:26:38.581]  He spent millions of dollars funding the cackling corpse that is Hillary Clinton, only to see her crash and burn.
[00:26:39.201 --> 00:26:42.783]  Now, he's insulting Trump, calling him a Nazi, a wannabe dictator.
[00:26:43.223 --> 00:26:47.489]  That's especially rich coming from a known Nazi collaborator.
[00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:57.183]  And now that Hillary, his precious Jim, the one that he thought he was finally going to get the final death blow on the U.S., has been eliminated, what can he do?
[00:26:57.684 --> 00:26:59.166]  This man must be stopped.
[00:26:59.827 --> 00:27:09.934]  Now, use the hashtag DeportSoros on your social media, such as Facebook and Instagram, and get the word out to your friends about this maniacal socialist dictator.
[00:27:10.535 --> 00:27:19.121]  And for more vital information, you can visit InfoWars.com and take a look at Paul Watson's report, Soros, Trump is a would-be dictator who threatens the New World Order.
[00:27:19.822 --> 00:27:21.763]  Now I'd like to key you in on a great product.
[00:27:21.823 --> 00:27:28.568]  I mean, sure, everyone that knows InfoWars knows about the Hillary for Prison shirts, but do you know about our 2017 version, now featuring
[00:27:30.086 --> 00:27:31.007]  George Soros.
[00:27:31.848 --> 00:27:37.095]  Our good friend here is revealed in his true state, that of an evil stealing goblin who destroys countries.
[00:27:37.395 --> 00:27:38.817]  You can get him on your shirt today.
[00:27:39.217 --> 00:27:46.006]  So go to Infowarsstore.com today and order your very own Hillary for Prison 2017 shirt, now featuring
[00:27:49.338 --> 00:27:54.402]  You cannot make up the oxymoronic upside-down world of this.
[00:27:55.143 --> 00:28:01.407]  Soros says Trump is a would-be dictator who threatens the new world order.
[00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.331]  That's an InfoWars.com story.
[00:28:06.631 --> 00:28:07.932]  Top story on the right-hand side.
[00:28:08.053 --> 00:28:12.656]  And under it you can actually read the full screed of diarrhea out of Soros' mouth.
[00:28:13.477 --> 00:28:16.219]  Billionaire globalist pins panicked rant.
[00:28:18.576 --> 00:28:19.817]  And boy is it panicked.
[00:28:19.877 --> 00:28:21.898]  He says, we cannot stop nationalism.
[00:28:22.258 --> 00:28:28.101]  And he said, not since I was a young man have I feared Trump is Hitler.
[00:28:28.121 --> 00:28:33.985]  Ladies and gentlemen, he actually calls Trump Hitler and a dictator.
[00:28:34.205 --> 00:28:37.346]  He calls him a Hitlerian dictator.
[00:28:39.308 --> 00:28:41.309]  Now, is this lost on anyone?
[00:28:41.729 --> 00:28:47.032]  George Soros is a famous Nazi collaborator.
[00:28:48.336 --> 00:28:49.896]  From the age of 13 to 17.
[00:28:53.937 --> 00:29:02.619]  Because no one thought that a young Jew coming in and claiming he was helping get food to groups that were hiding would actually be a Nazi agent.
[00:29:02.679 --> 00:29:11.842]  He was a literal Nazi agent of the lowest scumbag order and he's going to lecture us about Adolf Hitler.
[00:29:12.022 --> 00:29:13.042]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:29:13.928 --> 00:29:16.690]  It is the total, complete inversion of reality.
[00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:21.514]  We have him on 60 Minutes saying he is not ashamed of what he did.
[00:29:21.554 --> 00:29:25.176]  It's how he, quote, survived a total sociopath.
[00:29:25.576 --> 00:29:36.604]  While hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews were being shipped off to the death camps, George Soros accompanied his phony godfather on his appointed rounds, confiscating property from the Jews.
[00:29:36.945 --> 00:29:38.045]  I was 14 years old.
[00:29:38.926 --> 00:29:41.467]  And I would say that that's when my character was made.
[00:29:41.607 --> 00:29:43.608]  It was a tremendous threat of evil.
[00:29:43.728 --> 00:29:46.550]  I mean, it was a very personal experience of evil.
[00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:54.133]  I don't feel guilty because I'm engaged in an amoral activity which is not meant to have anything to do with guilt.
[00:29:54.533 --> 00:29:56.975]  I think that I've been blamed for everything.
[00:29:57.415 --> 00:30:01.197]  I am basically there to make money.
[00:30:01.657 --> 00:30:06.319]  I cannot and do not look at the social consequences of what I do.
[00:30:06.519 --> 00:30:10.201]  You should have been arrested and in a lot of trouble back when you were 15 years old.
[00:30:11.182 --> 00:30:15.424]  You are a true supervillain out to hurt good people.
[00:30:15.905 --> 00:30:16.845]  You hate Christians.
[00:30:17.286 --> 00:30:18.246]  You're a dirtbag.
[00:30:18.866 --> 00:30:19.547]  Are you religious?
[00:30:20.407 --> 00:30:20.547]  No.
[00:30:22.449 --> 00:30:23.149]  Do you believe in God?
[00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.150]  No.
[00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:29.293]  For the stories up on InfoWars.com, it's obviously on DrudgeReport.com, it's a Paul Joseph Watson article.
[00:30:30.729 --> 00:30:34.931]  Soros conjures Hitler in attack on ascendant populist.
[00:30:35.431 --> 00:30:38.553]  That's the area that Zero Hedge decided to zero in on.
[00:30:39.153 --> 00:30:43.135]  Famous Nazi collaborator says Trump reminds him of Hitler.
[00:30:43.235 --> 00:30:44.536]  What in the world?
[00:30:45.036 --> 00:30:47.177]  He says, I'm afraid of Nazis.
[00:30:47.798 --> 00:30:48.058]  What?
[00:30:49.264 --> 00:30:51.327]  You are a Nazi dirtbag!
[00:30:51.347 --> 00:30:54.510]  It was actually probably the happiest year of my life.
[00:30:55.351 --> 00:30:57.514]  That year of German occupation.
[00:30:57.594 --> 00:30:59.637]  For me it was a very positive experience.
[00:31:00.157 --> 00:31:01.759]  He was a little Judas goat they sent him.
[00:31:01.779 --> 00:31:05.784]  Kind of like pedophiles send a teenager in or another kid to get other kids lured to the van.
[00:31:06.545 --> 00:31:12.989]  Yes, George Soros was the bait they would throw out to bring in and find where the Jews were hidden.
[00:31:13.289 --> 00:31:15.691]  I mean, you just cannot make this stuff up.
[00:31:17.111 --> 00:31:18.572]  You couldn't write this stuff.
[00:31:18.913 --> 00:31:19.893]  No one would believe it.
[00:31:20.173 --> 00:31:27.238]  And now he's perched on top of the country, blaming Russia for America turning against Hillary, while she's stumbling around having convulsions.
[00:31:27.278 --> 00:31:28.418]  Everybody's sick of her.
[00:31:28.658 --> 00:31:29.999]  Russia wasn't involved in anything.
[00:31:30.019 --> 00:31:35.883]  You got the Communist Chinese, the EU, the Vatican, the Saudi Arabians, all piled up on our election.
[00:31:36.483 --> 00:31:52.918]  Saying we can't have Trump, that gets overthrown and now Obama is set to announce all sorts of wartime measures and troop build-ups and cyber attacks and diplomatic freezing of Russian money and all this economic war with 21 days out.
[00:31:53.999 --> 00:31:56.962]  And I was watching CNN, I forget the names of the shows, I rarely watch it.
[00:31:56.982 --> 00:31:59.825]  I was watching it last night and they had a roundtable grip on it.
[00:31:59.845 --> 00:32:01.166]  I've got to go look at the show hosts.
[00:32:01.566 --> 00:32:01.907]  It was like
[00:32:03.548 --> 00:32:04.208]  630 at night.
[00:32:04.629 --> 00:32:05.509]  Who's on at 630?
[00:32:06.109 --> 00:32:07.670]  Some guy, I don't know his name.
[00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:09.371]  Some gray-haired dude.
[00:32:09.391 --> 00:32:20.416]  He had this roundtable on there and they were, folks, just like before 9-11, 25 days before, I came on there and I said they're going to blow up World Trade Center, blame it on Bin Laden, get ready for terrorism.
[00:32:21.296 --> 00:32:23.077]  I saw the same tell-tale signs.
[00:32:23.417 --> 00:32:26.679]  They said it is going to be Trump's fault, the war that's coming now.
[00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:29.751]  Islam is going to attack Europe and Israel.
[00:32:29.851 --> 00:32:38.134]  There is a giant war coming, and there's going to be a war with Russia, and it is Trump's fault, and all the roundtable goes, it's very sad, but it is to be.
[00:32:38.454 --> 00:32:55.280]  And you can tell, the fix is in, they're going to start World War III, they're a freaking loon cult, who are under Stockholm Syndrome, and under Arabist control, and this is a real pivot to Islam, and the takedown of the West, and it was a cult of scum, a bunch of CIA operatives up there on the show, all
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:00.523]  Committing to a giant war, and then America's gonna have to be destroyed now because we voted for Trump.
[00:33:02.484 --> 00:33:07.266]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[00:33:07.426 --> 00:33:14.490]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:19.153]  I started to exercise really hard again, and I started to try to eat healthy.
[00:33:19.373 --> 00:33:21.034]  Started taking third-party supplements.
[00:33:21.414 --> 00:33:23.215]  Started seeing some more gains.
[00:33:23.795 --> 00:33:24.015]  I think?
[00:33:42.092 --> 00:33:45.435]  I was in the best shape of my life since I'd been in really good shape in my 20s.
[00:33:45.455 --> 00:33:46.536]  But the election heated up.
[00:33:46.576 --> 00:33:48.959]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[00:33:49.079 --> 00:33:58.348]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[00:33:58.548 --> 00:33:59.509]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[00:33:59.689 --> 00:34:03.372]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put Lazy Susan back on the table.
[00:34:04.173 --> 00:34:06.295]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again.
[00:34:07.015 --> 00:34:10.238]  And I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[00:34:10.278 --> 00:34:11.579]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:15.281]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:34:15.482 --> 00:34:16.402]  It's December 5th, 2016.
[00:34:16.522 --> 00:34:20.105]  We're only like 25 days from 2017.
[00:34:20.485 --> 00:34:30.553]  And I want to invite all of the info workers of every race, color, and creed that bleed red blood and love liberty, justice, and truth to make our bodies great again.
[00:34:33.564 --> 00:34:38.587]  One of the most common questions I get is, you've changed the whole radio TV model.
[00:34:39.348 --> 00:34:40.088]  How did you do it?
[00:34:40.148 --> 00:34:43.030]  Did an ad agency teach you that or what book did you read?
[00:34:43.351 --> 00:34:44.912]  And the answer is, it was trial and error.
[00:34:45.172 --> 00:34:50.475]  I promote products that I personally use, like the Nutraceuticals and Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:50.956 --> 00:34:52.777]  And it's the same thing for this promotion.
[00:34:53.277 --> 00:34:54.598]  I didn't get this from an ad agency.
[00:34:54.658 --> 00:34:55.859]  I didn't just think this up.
[00:34:56.339 --> 00:35:03.184]  I was sitting there, I'd gained probably 10, 15 pounds because I've gotten out of the habit of taking the supplements in the last few months with the election.
[00:35:03.964 --> 00:35:14.030]  And I was thinking, wow, I need to religiously take these, because I'm promoting these things, it's making me healthier, and if I'm not taking them, you know, I'm fatter, plus people aren't going to buy the product.
[00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.672]  So that's where the promotion comes from, is purely from reality.
[00:35:18.012 --> 00:35:24.816]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table, I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[00:35:24.856 --> 00:35:31.640]  I've lost five pounds religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:32.561]  It's amazing.
[00:35:32.861 --> 00:35:35.245]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[00:35:35.505 --> 00:35:38.229]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:35:38.429 --> 00:35:40.992]  And to be clear, I'm exercising the same amount.
[00:35:41.693 --> 00:35:45.599]  It's the holidays, so I'm eating pumpkin pie, pecan pie.
[00:35:45.799 --> 00:35:47.000]  I ate a candy bar last night.
[00:35:48.456 --> 00:35:51.598]  I mean, quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[00:35:52.018 --> 00:35:53.299]  So I'm eating worse.
[00:35:53.919 --> 00:36:01.283]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost 5 pounds.
[00:36:01.443 --> 00:36:01.983]  It's incredible.
[00:36:02.984 --> 00:36:04.905]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[00:36:05.145 --> 00:36:06.406]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[00:36:06.506 --> 00:36:08.927]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[00:36:09.527 --> 00:36:10.408]  This is an experiment.
[00:36:10.528 --> 00:36:11.268]  Everybody's watching.
[00:36:11.529 --> 00:36:12.349]  We'll see what happens.
[00:36:12.789 --> 00:36:13.930]  This is Part 2.
[00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:15.571]  Next week, Part 3.
[00:36:16.451 --> 00:36:17.052]  That's a good point.
[00:36:17.892 --> 00:36:26.998]  We just cut there and Rob Deuce said, hey Alex, I know you don't follow script, but you might want to add to people, we're running some of the biggest specials of the year until December 17th.
[00:36:27.279 --> 00:36:33.003]  That's the last day that you can get your order in and have guaranteed shipping anywhere in the United States.
[00:36:33.183 --> 00:36:34.924]  And we have some of the biggest specials of the year.
[00:36:34.944 --> 00:36:37.486]  50% off many of the nutraceuticals.
[00:36:37.806 --> 00:36:38.667]  The lowest discount is 25%.
[00:36:38.707 --> 00:36:38.847]  30% off X2.
[00:36:41.889 --> 00:36:46.991]  Huge discounts and free shipping store wide on every product, thousands of items.
[00:36:47.412 --> 00:36:51.794]  And on top of that, if you sign up for auto ship, an additional 10% off.
[00:36:51.834 --> 00:36:56.776]  And I'm going to do one more bad thing because I'm politically correct, or I guess I'm politically incorrect.
[00:36:57.236 --> 00:36:59.257]  And that's a Merry Christmas to everybody.
[00:36:59.597 --> 00:37:00.758]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:37:00.838 --> 00:37:01.378]  You're awesome.
[00:37:05.031 --> 00:37:10.515]  Folks, George Soros is a major player in geopolitical markets.
[00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:19.080]  This is a man that most people had never heard of until this most recent presidential election, and many people probably still don't know who he is.
[00:37:19.501 --> 00:37:28.667]  And we can tie him directly to the Clinton campaign, not just with the WikiLeaks emails, but also large donations that he has made to the Clinton campaign.
[00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:30.707]  And the Clinton Foundation.
[00:37:31.068 --> 00:37:34.488]  He can also be responsible for the Arab Spring Revolution.
[00:37:34.809 --> 00:37:41.310]  He has injected millions of dollars into Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and MoveOn.org.
[00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:47.472]  This is a man that has some serious leverage, some serious money, and some serious agendas.
[00:37:47.892 --> 00:37:49.452]  Now, he was on 60 Minutes in 1998.
[00:37:50.253 --> 00:37:53.293]  This is a quote-unquote long-lost interview.
[00:37:53.653 --> 00:37:55.414]  Alex Jones references it a lot.
[00:37:55.734 --> 00:38:02.042]  We're going to go through some of the major highlights from that interview and try to break down who George Soros really is.
[00:38:02.342 --> 00:38:08.870]  In the last two years you've been blamed for financial collapse of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Russia?
[00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:11.293]  All of the above.
[00:38:11.393 --> 00:38:12.054]  All of the above.
[00:38:12.254 --> 00:38:14.977]  Did you see the pride he had in that?
[00:38:15.894 --> 00:38:33.129]  What type of individual takes pride and gets a rise out of the fact that he's being called out for collapsing financial markets, collapsing economies, leading to many people starving, homeless, on the streets, and he's up there laughing, bragging about it?
[00:38:33.429 --> 00:38:34.450]  This is a sick individual.
[00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:37.113]  I think that I've been blamed for everything.
[00:38:37.553 --> 00:38:38.334]  I am basically
[00:38:39.034 --> 00:38:40.715]  That's right.
[00:38:56.983 --> 00:38:59.225]  Obviously he doesn't care about the social consequences.
[00:38:59.665 --> 00:39:11.292]  Look at the trouble that's come from the movements that he's funded, from the Arab Spring, to what happened at the Ukrainian and Russian border, to what's happening here in the United States with Black Lives Matter.
[00:39:11.652 --> 00:39:15.155]  This is a man who is trying to foment civil unrest.
[00:39:15.915 --> 00:39:23.340]  After the Dayton Peace Agreement in Bosnia in 1995, for a considerable period of time, George had given more money
[00:39:24.474 --> 00:39:26.255]  So you need to think about this.
[00:39:26.275 --> 00:39:28.496]  This is an individual, a big international banker,
[00:39:36.991 --> 00:39:43.873]  Who apparently has more power, more negotiating leverage than the United States government.
[00:39:44.053 --> 00:39:47.775]  More influence than the United States government and we the people.
[00:39:47.875 --> 00:39:49.075]  Think about that folks.
[00:39:49.115 --> 00:39:54.557]  That's one man, George Soros, with more influence than the entire United States government.
[00:39:55.157 --> 00:39:57.358]  Whatever you think about that is up to you.
[00:39:57.698 --> 00:39:58.939]  But that's what went on.
[00:39:59.159 --> 00:40:02.460]  As a competitor, I've got to compete to win.
[00:40:03.181 --> 00:40:09.203]  As a human being, I am concerned about the society in which I live.
[00:40:09.663 --> 00:40:11.524]  Which George Soros am I talking to now?
[00:40:11.604 --> 00:40:14.926]  The amoral George Soros or the moral George Soros?
[00:40:16.346 --> 00:40:17.227]  It's one person.
[00:40:18.067 --> 00:40:26.133]  It's one person who at one time engages in amoral activities and that the rest of the time tries to be moral.
[00:40:26.754 --> 00:40:45.709]  So here he is trying to use word magic to trick himself into the hypocrisy that he's living in where he says that he cares about the society that he lives in but also he recognizes that his actions, well he doesn't really worry about the outcome it has on the society around him.
[00:40:46.189 --> 00:40:51.550]  So, I'm thinking, now this is a guy who went through a very traumatizing experience as a kid, which we'll get to.
[00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:55.711]  I'm thinking George Soros might actually have split personality disorder, folks.
[00:40:56.031 --> 00:41:07.053]  While hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews were being shipped off to the death camps, George Soros accompanied his phony godfather on his appointed rounds, confiscating property from the Jews.
[00:41:07.794 --> 00:41:09.814]  You're a Hungarian Jew?
[00:41:11.547 --> 00:41:16.470]  Who escaped the Holocaust by posing as a Christian.
[00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.910]  Right.
[00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:19.291]  Lots of people get shipped off to the death camps.
[00:41:19.331 --> 00:41:19.612]  Right.
[00:41:20.212 --> 00:41:21.353]  I was 14 years old.
[00:41:22.213 --> 00:41:24.735]  And I would say that that's when my character was made.
[00:41:25.215 --> 00:41:25.735]  In what way?
[00:41:26.135 --> 00:41:31.038]  That one should think ahead, one should understand and anticipate events.
[00:41:32.419 --> 00:41:35.501]  And one is threatened.
[00:41:35.941 --> 00:41:37.942]  It was a tremendous threat of evil.
[00:41:38.062 --> 00:41:40.864]  I mean, it was a very personal experience of evil.
[00:41:41.502 --> 00:41:51.344]  So here he is justifying his actions as a teenager, going from being raised Jewish to being a turncoat and turning in Jews to the Nazis.
[00:41:51.905 --> 00:41:53.025]  But did you hear what he said there?
[00:41:54.045 --> 00:41:56.706]  This basically set the path for him the rest of the way.
[00:41:56.746 --> 00:42:00.287]  He said he realized that if you can get out ahead of something, you can take advantage of it.
[00:42:00.547 --> 00:42:01.227]  How sick is that?
[00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:05.672]  Hey, I realize that the Nazis are coming in here to round up the Jews.
[00:42:06.113 --> 00:42:10.155]  Well, I guess I'll collaborate with the Nazis because that'll benefit me in the long run.
[00:42:10.516 --> 00:42:14.018]  This is what we're seeing him still doing to this day, folks.
[00:42:14.578 --> 00:42:21.202]  Fomenting civil unrest and then trying to leverage political power with people like the Clintons on the back end of it.
[00:42:21.583 --> 00:42:30.348]  That sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years.
[00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:32.110]  Was it difficult?
[00:42:34.473 --> 00:42:35.795]  Not at all.
[00:42:36.115 --> 00:42:36.696]  Not at all.
[00:42:37.457 --> 00:42:41.302]  Maybe as a child you don't see the connection.
[00:42:43.685 --> 00:42:47.050]  But it created no problem at all.
[00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:47.991]  No feeling of guilt?
[00:42:48.392 --> 00:42:48.472]  No.
[00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:56.974]  So somehow he has no feeling of guilt for rounding up and turning in Jews during the Nazi reign of terror over the Jewish people.
[00:42:57.134 --> 00:42:57.454]  Wow!
[00:42:57.895 --> 00:43:06.377]  Of course I could be on the other side or I could be the one from whom the thing is being taken away if I weren't there.
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:13.002]  Of course I wasn't doing it, but somebody else would be taking it away anyhow.
[00:43:13.923 --> 00:43:18.605]  Whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator, the property was being taken away.
[00:43:19.665 --> 00:43:23.207]  So I had no role in taking away that property.
[00:43:24.147 --> 00:43:25.368]  So I had no sense of guilt.
[00:43:26.044 --> 00:43:34.093]  Whether I or somebody else does whatever is happening in the markets really doesn't make any difference to the outcome.
[00:43:34.654 --> 00:43:41.902]  I don't feel guilty because I'm engaged in an amoral activity which is not meant to have anything to do with guilt.
[00:43:42.475 --> 00:44:00.602]  So again, he's feeling no guilt for this at all, and this is something that would lead to you having a split personality disorder, where one side of you is being a traitor to your peers, but then the other side of you is trying to take advantage of that very thing while justifying it within your own social construct.
[00:44:00.942 --> 00:44:06.525]  So perhaps, you know, maybe George Soros really does have split personality, but regardless, he justifies
[00:44:07.305 --> 00:44:12.731]  Working to round up Jews, basically collaborating with the Nazis, because, hey, everyone was doing it.
[00:44:12.791 --> 00:44:13.973]  Someone was going to do it anyway.
[00:44:14.413 --> 00:44:15.575]  I might as well get on board.
[00:44:16.095 --> 00:44:20.020]  This is the type of person funding Black Lives Matter and Democrats.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.081]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:44:22.022 --> 00:44:22.703]  Are you religious?
[00:44:23.564 --> 00:44:23.704]  No.
[00:44:25.626 --> 00:44:26.267]  Do you believe in God?
[00:44:28.456 --> 00:44:36.587]  Soros told us he believes God was created by man, not the other way around, which may be why he thinks he can smooth out the world's imperfections.
[00:44:36.968 --> 00:44:43.396]  So not religious, doesn't believe in God, but at the same time cares about the society around him, but why is that?
[00:44:44.037 --> 00:44:47.819]  I am basically there to make money.
[00:44:48.279 --> 00:44:53.002]  I cannot and do not look at the social consequences of what I do.
[00:44:53.502 --> 00:44:55.323]  So that's what he's in this for, folks.
[00:44:55.683 --> 00:44:56.844]  Money and power.
[00:44:57.264 --> 00:45:00.806]  Because we are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
[00:45:02.567 --> 00:45:05.929]  Because we find it more convenient to operate without it.
[00:45:06.609 --> 00:45:08.890]  So in some ways it's to escape regulation?
[00:45:09.151 --> 00:45:09.671]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:45:10.598 --> 00:45:11.979]  That's the nature of these people.
[00:45:12.119 --> 00:45:12.899]  Do as I say, not as I do.
[00:45:12.939 --> 00:45:17.802]  He's up here promoting all these regulations, but at the same time, he's above them.
[00:45:30.549 --> 00:45:30.849]  Okay?
[00:45:31.169 --> 00:45:33.510]  This is the makeup of these people, folks.
[00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:41.252]  These are the people that are promoting all their agendas, but expecting to be held to a different standard than the people they're imposing them on.
[00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:49.654]  And is giving away his billions now with the same determination that he made them in places like Haiti, a country that has less money in the bank than he does.
[00:45:53.055 --> 00:45:53.676]  Look at that witch.
[00:45:53.696 --> 00:45:54.678]  Look at the arrogance way.
[00:45:54.698 --> 00:45:55.178]  Oh my gosh.
[00:46:04.409 --> 00:46:08.511]  Of course George Soros and Hillary Clinton were in Haiti in the 90s.
[00:46:08.892 --> 00:46:10.512]  And then at the end of it, what does Hillary say?
[00:46:11.073 --> 00:46:13.434]  Oh, George is here to help you guys build hospitals.
[00:46:13.814 --> 00:46:14.915]  How did that turn out?
[00:46:15.255 --> 00:46:24.860]  If the beneficiaries of Soros' billions do not understand the intricacies of SEC rules and offshore hedge funds, they do understand what he's done for them.
[00:46:25.521 --> 00:46:31.564]  The president of Haiti is reading his new book, The Crisis of Global Capitalism, and so is President Clinton.
[00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:34.412]  Will all the attention spoil George Soros?
[00:46:34.952 --> 00:46:36.033]  So that's right, folks.
[00:46:36.173 --> 00:46:40.617]  George Soros is here trying to claim how he's going to help Haiti.
[00:46:40.977 --> 00:46:43.479]  But the Haiti leaders, they don't really understand all of it.
[00:46:43.499 --> 00:46:47.563]  They can't really understand SEC this, financial markets that.
[00:46:47.923 --> 00:46:48.643]  I don't really know.
[00:46:48.864 --> 00:46:51.406]  But what they do understand is they're getting rich.
[00:46:51.686 --> 00:46:54.248]  Clintons and the Soros still have millions and billions of dollars.
[00:46:54.468 --> 00:46:55.389]  But look at Haiti now.
[00:46:55.809 --> 00:47:00.013]  George Soros, in a way, is Donald Trump without the humility.
[00:47:03.024 --> 00:47:11.171]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:20.958]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.379 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.302 --> 00:47:28.304]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.324 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.
[00:47:53.493 --> 00:47:54.533]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.

[00:48:59.626 --> 00:49:02.287]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:07.759 --> 00:49:12.400]  And I want to add something that the folks at the White House need to really understand.
[00:49:12.921 --> 00:49:19.562]  If Washington takes new hostile steps, it will receive an answer.
[00:49:20.022 --> 00:49:29.284]  This applies to any actions against Russian diplomatic mission in the United States, which will immediately backfire at the U.S.
[00:49:29.485 --> 00:49:30.965]  diplomats in Russia.
[00:49:32.042 --> 00:49:44.870]  Well, one has to wonder if this was the agenda behind the Russian hacking or all these narratives against Russia to try to foment this war, try to foment the butting of heads between Russia and the United States.
[00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:49.272]  And hearing that out of Russia today was something that was very upsetting to me.
[00:49:49.412 --> 00:49:52.794]  Now it seems like Russia has finally had enough of U.S.
[00:49:52.874 --> 00:49:55.616]  poking them, prodding them, trying to tick them off.
[00:49:55.736 --> 00:49:57.337]  It seems like now they finally had enough.
[00:49:57.837 --> 00:50:01.838]  I pray that they can wait another 22 or 23 days, whatever it is, until Trump gets in.
[00:50:02.158 --> 00:50:05.139]  But ladies, I'm joined now by Leanne McAdoo and Maggie Howe.
[00:50:06.039 --> 00:50:10.580]  It looks like they're going to try to foment this war right up to the very end.
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:11.440]  They're not going to stop.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:21.242]  At least make it as messy as possible before Obama leaves office to create a massive debacle for Donald Trump to have to deal with and his administration so they can't
[00:50:22.982 --> 00:50:24.463]  Move toward making America great again.
[00:50:24.483 --> 00:50:25.904]  They're going to have to clean up this mess.
[00:50:26.364 --> 00:50:36.130]  So of course, you know, this Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman is talking about this last minute provision in the defense authorization bill that was just signed into law by Obama last week.
[00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:38.192]  The Russians claim that this is going to allow the U.S.
[00:50:38.232 --> 00:50:42.054]  to supply anti-aircraft weapons to the so-called rebels in Syria.
[00:50:42.474 --> 00:50:43.995]  Obama wants to make it easier.
[00:50:44.015 --> 00:50:51.260]  Doesn't want to have to get to the bureaucratic mess of being able to give weapons to these so-called moderate rebels who we know are defecting to ISIS.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.321]  And I mean, it's a mess over there.
[00:50:53.361 --> 00:50:56.882]  And this is in addition to the fact on the 16th, the U.S.
[00:50:57.062 --> 00:51:00.104]  started sending tanks to Europe to send a message to Russia.
[00:51:00.344 --> 00:51:06.266]  Well, and I think that that's treason, what Obama is doing as far as putting weapons into the hands of moderate rebels.
[00:51:06.286 --> 00:51:08.647]  We've been doing this informally since 2013.
[00:51:08.707 --> 00:51:11.769]  We've been shipping, we've had arms shipped to Syria.
[00:51:11.789 --> 00:51:13.009]  We know exactly where they're going.
[00:51:13.369 --> 00:51:18.312]  The problem with this, guys, OK, so this international, the international political implications of this are unprecedented.
[00:51:18.372 --> 00:51:21.333]  What he's trying to do, this false narrative that
[00:51:21.893 --> 00:51:25.535]  They hacked our electoral system, and they're responsible for putting Trump in office.
[00:51:25.555 --> 00:51:27.877]  He has to appear like he's diplomatic now.
[00:51:27.917 --> 00:51:29.238]  He's taking aggressive action.
[00:51:29.578 --> 00:51:32.780]  He's trying to look presidential, but the only thing he looks like is lame.
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:39.304]  And the Russians tweeted this out via their UK embassy, this little duck quacking with the words lame over it.
[00:51:39.524 --> 00:51:45.908]  In English, they say President Obama expels 35 Russian diplomats, Cold War déjà vu style.
[00:51:46.488 --> 00:51:51.954]  And everyone, including the American people, will be glad to see this hapless administration go.
[00:51:51.974 --> 00:51:55.117]  They're calling our presidential administration hapless.
[00:51:55.237 --> 00:51:56.659]  I could not agree more with them.
[00:51:56.719 --> 00:51:58.481]  And they post a lame duck.
[00:51:58.541 --> 00:52:02.525]  I mean, the meme war has taken over here.
[00:52:02.545 --> 00:52:08.171]  Well, we're going to find out if he really is a lame duck, though, because, OK, you know, the lame duck is... He's just lame, not the duck.
[00:52:08.411 --> 00:52:11.514]  Well, if he really is a lame duck, then none of this is going to work.
[00:52:11.534 --> 00:52:12.775]  We will avoid war.
[00:52:13.515 --> 00:52:16.238]  We'll hopefully avoid any retaliation by Russia.
[00:52:16.298 --> 00:52:17.479]  We'll avoid this whole mess.
[00:52:17.939 --> 00:52:24.965]  You know, maybe we can find some stabilization in Syria, some stabilization in the Middle East, and get all the lies and misinformation out of it.
[00:52:25.005 --> 00:52:27.907]  But just to be clear, what happened, as you mentioned, U.S.
[00:52:27.967 --> 00:52:29.449]  expels 35 Russian diplomats.
[00:52:29.489 --> 00:52:31.230]  You saw the response from Russia today.
[00:52:31.771 --> 00:52:32.011]  U.S.
[00:52:32.051 --> 00:52:34.453]  is also announcing new sanctions against Russia.
[00:52:34.713 --> 00:52:39.300]  But let's remember, this is all on the heels of Barack Obama saying, there's no such thing as a rigged election.
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.882]  I've never heard of a rigged election.
[00:52:41.102 --> 00:52:47.592]  And by the way, I love this story, out of the hill, Obama is under pressure to prove Russian interference in an election.
[00:52:47.892 --> 00:52:49.254]  They still can't prove it!
[00:52:49.314 --> 00:52:50.015]  They can't prove it.
[00:52:50.075 --> 00:52:50.416]  Not only that.
[00:52:50.436 --> 00:52:51.197]  They offered no proof.
[00:52:51.497 --> 00:52:52.518]  You mentioned Syria.
[00:52:52.578 --> 00:52:57.402]  Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin met today to talk about a ceasefire agreement in Syria.
[00:52:57.422 --> 00:52:58.083]  Left Obama out.
[00:52:58.163 --> 00:52:59.344]  They left the President out.
[00:52:59.384 --> 00:53:01.606]  He is so disrespected in the international community.
[00:53:01.646 --> 00:53:02.847]  He's not even a part of the talks.
[00:53:03.227 --> 00:53:08.972]  We've been the destabilizer in Syria, and for people who aren't following this, we tried to topple Assad.
[00:53:08.992 --> 00:53:10.674]  It was very ineffective on our part.
[00:53:10.994 --> 00:53:13.216]  Not only was it ineffective, it was embarrassing.
[00:53:13.576 --> 00:53:16.579]  He's been left out of the negotiation table like a petulant child.
[00:53:16.919 --> 00:53:20.822]  Now we've thrown 35 Russian diplomats out of the country?
[00:53:20.842 --> 00:53:22.784]  He's like a petulant child!
[00:53:22.864 --> 00:53:27.508]  And that's the lame duck aspect, where they don't even have enough respect for him to include him in the ceasefire.
[00:53:27.528 --> 00:53:29.089]  They know he would just muddy the waters.
[00:53:29.129 --> 00:53:30.010]  That's what he's the best at.
[00:53:30.591 --> 00:53:32.973]  But also, here's another lame duck aspect to Obama.
[00:53:33.353 --> 00:53:34.154]  We elected Trump.
[00:53:34.754 --> 00:53:35.014]  Right.
[00:53:35.354 --> 00:53:48.981]  Well, and so that's kind of the thing, is a lot of people are saying, you know, we've got President-elect Donald Trump there, the Republicans are in controllable houses, so anything that Obama pushes in the last minute and all of his executive orders are just going to easily be overturned.
[00:53:49.361 --> 00:53:52.762]  Well, not if he creates such a destabilizing mess.
[00:53:52.882 --> 00:53:58.625]  If he's got 4,000 troops on the ground there in Europe, I mean, what is Trump going to do when he gets in?
[00:53:58.785 --> 00:53:59.746]  Pull everything back?
[00:53:59.786 --> 00:54:02.367]  I mean, there's going to be absolute chaos.
[00:54:03.007 --> 00:54:06.110]  And it's kind of like his little parting gift to the Trump administration.
[00:54:06.311 --> 00:54:10.655]  And I'd love for Barack Obama to just take a golfing trip for the next three weeks and do nothing.
[00:54:10.675 --> 00:54:11.796]  I thought he was playing golf.
[00:54:11.816 --> 00:54:12.898]  He's back now?
[00:54:13.879 --> 00:54:14.900]  Stay on vacation.
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:15.560]  Go to the gym.
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:18.043]  Leave everybody else alone.
[00:54:18.283 --> 00:54:20.305]  $3.5 million per family vacation.
[00:54:20.325 --> 00:54:22.027]  $85 million in total equipment.
[00:54:22.067 --> 00:54:22.948]  It's up to $96 million now.
[00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:26.251]  It'll be looking at about a hundred million.
[00:54:26.271 --> 00:54:30.896]  You know, most Americans are lucky if they can take their kids to a beach in Florida for two days, honestly.
[00:54:31.216 --> 00:54:33.778]  For him to spend this sort of money and then to create this havoc.
[00:54:33.798 --> 00:54:43.267]  John Rappaport said this today himself, that the ideal scenario for this administration is to create as much turmoil as they possibly can to cuck everything up.
[00:54:43.727 --> 00:54:49.708]  To the point where the first 100 days of Trump's administration is focused on undoing these horrific measures.
[00:54:49.728 --> 00:54:51.269]  But it looks like the Russians get it.
[00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:52.109]  They get this.
[00:54:52.409 --> 00:54:54.429]  I mean, I think we're in a holding pattern.
[00:54:54.489 --> 00:54:57.130]  Well, and that's interesting because you talk about getting it.
[00:54:57.190 --> 00:55:06.712]  This is one of the major problems that I had today when they had this new thing to build up a war against Russia, the expelling of the 35 Russian diplomats here.
[00:55:07.692 --> 00:55:09.473]  I just, it bothers me so much.
[00:55:09.553 --> 00:55:12.794]  I'm seeing so much of the American public buy this.
[00:55:13.034 --> 00:55:14.254]  I mean, I'm shocked.
[00:55:14.294 --> 00:55:15.275]  I go on social media.
[00:55:15.355 --> 00:55:16.615]  I see what people are saying about it.
[00:55:16.995 --> 00:55:22.637]  I mean, they really believe, they really believe that Donald Trump is essentially, I guess, a Russian dictator.
[00:55:22.917 --> 00:55:26.278]  They really think that somehow we're being influenced by Russia here.
[00:55:26.298 --> 00:55:28.539]  I mean, it's the most absurd thing, but they totally believe it.
[00:55:29.139 --> 00:55:40.212]  And I think it kind of speaks volumes to the amount of petulance and disrespect that President Obama hasn't offered any proof of these hacking claims to the House Intelligence Committee.
[00:55:40.312 --> 00:55:43.595]  They have yet to receive any of the specific proof.
[00:55:43.635 --> 00:55:44.977]  They have not been briefed on this at all.
[00:55:46.298 --> 00:55:50.740]  NBC, the New York Times, all of the media outlets are getting these anonymous sources.
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:57.142]  So they're being briefed on whatever it is, but the actual, our actual representatives there in the government are not being briefed.
[00:55:57.182 --> 00:56:03.164]  I mean, that's why you have people on Twitter and just your average American person out there who's believing the propaganda.
[00:56:03.784 --> 00:56:05.566]  We've been trying to sanction Russia since 2014.
[00:56:05.987 --> 00:56:19.861]  Our ambassador in Moscow actually left his post with the tension in Crimea and we began sanctioning them and forcing our allies, our Western allies, to freeze their assets abroad, to kick their kids out of schools abroad.
[00:56:20.161 --> 00:56:23.464]  This is nothing new for this aggressive administration that we have.
[00:56:23.845 --> 00:56:24.746]  Fortunately though,
[00:56:25.566 --> 00:56:29.967]  I'm really encouraged with this tweet because it looks like they do understand our political system well.
[00:56:29.987 --> 00:56:32.788]  They do understand we don't respect our own president.
[00:56:32.848 --> 00:56:34.769]  Nobody believes his lies.
[00:56:35.089 --> 00:56:44.091]  Because of Infowars, because of people that want to tell the truth, we're able to pierce the darkness and pull back the veil a little bit from this utter madness.
[00:56:44.131 --> 00:56:44.871]  You mentioned proof.
[00:56:45.111 --> 00:56:46.632]  He's never needed proof before now.
[00:56:47.312 --> 00:56:47.572]  I don't know.
[00:57:07.263 --> 00:57:07.964]  I have no proof.
[00:57:08.344 --> 00:57:12.908]  It's a big conspiracy theory, but you should all be super afraid, and that's why we're starting World War III.
[00:57:12.928 --> 00:57:16.731]  We're putting missiles on the Polish border, and troops and tanks and guns.
[00:57:16.751 --> 00:57:23.197]  We're going to just line them all up, you know, because we have that right to, because we're affiliated with the peace agreement, and we have the right to do this.
[00:57:23.898 --> 00:57:24.798]  We're the aggressor.
[00:57:24.918 --> 00:57:25.739]  People don't understand.
[00:57:26.039 --> 00:57:27.601]  We are the aggressor in this case.
[00:57:27.621 --> 00:57:28.481]  They're not sanctioning us.
[00:57:28.642 --> 00:57:29.943]  They're not putting troops on our border.
[00:57:29.983 --> 00:57:33.186]  They don't have any sort of missiles along the Polish border facing us.
[00:57:33.846 --> 00:57:35.747]  This is just utter crazy.
[00:57:35.807 --> 00:57:37.407]  Well, let's put this in perspective for a second.
[00:57:37.527 --> 00:57:39.928]  Okay, so they want to say Russia hacked our election.
[00:57:40.288 --> 00:57:41.649]  That rhetoric is completely false.
[00:57:41.969 --> 00:57:44.330]  The only thing that hacked the election was the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:57:44.350 --> 00:57:44.930]  That's been proven.
[00:57:45.090 --> 00:57:45.230]  Right.
[00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:46.270]  So what are we talking about here?
[00:57:46.631 --> 00:57:49.912]  Okay, Russia hacked the DNC and Podesta's emails, right?
[00:57:49.932 --> 00:57:50.152]  Possibly.
[00:57:50.592 --> 00:57:51.553]  Okay, so that's what we're being told.
[00:57:51.573 --> 00:57:54.094]  Wikileaks still disputes that it was Russia that gave them the witness.
[00:57:54.114 --> 00:57:55.255]  But let's say it was Russia.
[00:57:55.395 --> 00:57:56.796]  Okay, so what did Russia do?
[00:57:57.036 --> 00:57:58.757]  They exposed corruption!
[00:57:59.057 --> 00:58:03.220]  They exposed corruption within our own Democrat Party.
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:04.981]  Here, domestically, they exposed corruption.
[00:58:05.001 --> 00:58:07.183]  But whatever, here's the answer I would like from Obama.
[00:58:07.203 --> 00:58:08.123]  He's never going to prove it.
[00:58:08.623 --> 00:58:14.047]  Okay, why did Russia hack the DNC and the Podesta emails?
[00:58:14.507 --> 00:58:16.168]  What did Russia benefit?
[00:58:16.228 --> 00:58:17.109]  How did they benefit
[00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:21.551]  And how do they benefit from a Trump presidency other than we won't be going to war with them?
[00:58:21.831 --> 00:58:26.633]  And Hillary Clinton said it was just because of a personal beef that Putin had against her.
[00:58:26.833 --> 00:58:35.076]  And let's be clear, if Russia is hacking into emails, why aren't the same people who are up in arms to go to war with Russia
[00:58:35.536 --> 00:58:42.861]  Up in arms with the fact that Hillary Clinton had a private server with secret documents, classified documents on it.
[00:58:43.101 --> 00:58:49.566]  If Russia's hacking everything, if Russia's this big bad bear hacking everything, why don't you care about Hillary Clinton's emails that were probably hacked?
[00:58:49.786 --> 00:58:51.267]  But good news on the way out.
[00:58:51.607 --> 00:58:54.650]  Fox News election coverage tops ESPN primetime ratings.
[00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:57.532]  I think people are more concerned about the world than they are about sports.
[00:58:57.692 --> 00:58:59.013]  We'll see you tomorrow night, 7 p.m.
[00:58:59.053 --> 00:58:59.333]  Central.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.932]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.393 --> 00:59:20.121]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.442 --> 00:59:24.185]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.746 --> 00:59:27.588]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:36.017]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
