[00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:22.186]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.206 --> 00:00:25.927]  It is Monday, May 30th, 2016, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.307 --> 00:00:33.168]  Well, today is Memorial Day, the day that we remember those who paid the ultimate price for our freedoms and for this country.
[00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:37.890]  And every single day we're seeing this battle waging on.
[00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.690]  It's coming right here to our doorstep.
[00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.131]  We're seeing little fascist
[00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:57.324]  Social justice warriors out there trying to shut down free speech, spitting on the American flag, setting it on fire, and taking those freedoms for granted that someone died to give them the right to go out and do that.
[00:00:57.684 --> 00:01:06.392]  So we put together a show for you today in the hopes that it'll get every single American out there pissed off enough to join the fight for this country.
[00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:12.603]  I'm good.
[00:01:30.478 --> 00:01:33.680]  A lot of people discount their products that aren't their best sellers.
[00:01:34.541 --> 00:01:41.145]  At InfoWarsLife, I like to discount our best-selling products because that's what our listeners and viewers want.
[00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:44.287]  Super Metal Vitality has been sold out for two months.
[00:01:44.707 --> 00:01:45.608]  It's back in stock.
[00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:46.508]  It's
[00:02:03.778 --> 00:02:14.405]  Again, fruit punch, multivitamin, mineral drinks, you absorb more of it, the liver shield that helps detox the body and more, and so many other products that are our best sellers are 30% off.
[00:02:14.826 --> 00:02:21.890]  You can also get discounts on top of that, like free shipping on orders above $50 or 10% off when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.891]  There's so many specials.
[00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:29.515]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or by simply calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:02:32.137 --> 00:02:42.865]  And the other great part about this is you're funding the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty, an organization dedicated not just to our Republic, but human liberty and a new renaissance worldwide.
[00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:47.668]  So for myself, Alex Jones, and the InfoWars crew here in Austin, Texas, to the U.S.
[00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:51.111]  and across the world, God bless you all and thank you for your support.
[00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:59.357]  Humanity is awakening and supporting causes like InfoWars are essential in taking the fight to the globalist at the next level.
[00:03:05.144 --> 00:03:07.805]  Trump's a Nazi.
[00:03:08.506 --> 00:03:11.187]  How many Jews has Trump killed?
[00:03:11.247 --> 00:03:12.128]  Huh?
[00:03:12.248 --> 00:03:15.209]  How many Jews has Trump killed?
[00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.769]  Oh, please.
[00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:17.190]  How many Polish Gypsies?
[00:03:26.528 --> 00:03:27.048]  Oh, please.
[00:03:27.148 --> 00:03:29.070]  Shut up!
[00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.072]  Shut the f**k up!
[00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:34.593]  You know what?
[00:03:34.813 --> 00:03:36.735]  Go to your hell, homie!
[00:03:37.155 --> 00:03:39.116]  Trump, free all the homies!
[00:03:39.216 --> 00:03:39.857]  F**k them all!
[00:03:41.978 --> 00:03:44.319]  Which means you break up this assembly.
[00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:55.743]  If you do not do so, you may be arrested or subject to federal police action.
[00:04:06.687 --> 00:04:08.648]  Alright, what do you think is going to happen in like five minutes?
[00:04:09.308 --> 00:04:14.751]  In like five minutes there's going to be pepper spray and riot gear running all through here.
[00:04:15.452 --> 00:04:18.253]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[00:04:18.413 --> 00:04:29.459]  And in the name of the people of the state of California, demand all those assembled at fair and fair view be immediately dispersed.
[00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:34.662]  Word up, like, dude, he said that us Mexicans are bringing all types of bad people to this country?
[00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:35.783]  That's incorrect.
[00:04:50.162 --> 00:04:52.166]  Don't!
[00:04:52.407 --> 00:04:52.848]  Don't!
[00:05:15.757 --> 00:05:17.999]  But right now it's kind of a big fucking thing, bro.
[00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:18.859]  Big issues.
[00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:19.500]  Really?
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.700]  Making it fucking worse.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.041]  Really?
[00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:21.421]  Yeah.
[00:05:21.501 --> 00:05:23.983]  Okay, because he's unifying black and white people.
[00:05:24.003 --> 00:05:24.343]  No, he's not!
[00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:25.424]  Yes, he is.
[00:05:25.584 --> 00:05:26.685]  No, he's not!
[00:05:26.705 --> 00:05:28.986]  No, he's afraid of brown people.
[00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:30.727]  He wants to deport, yes!
[00:05:31.008 --> 00:05:32.429]  He wants to deport Mexicans.
[00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:36.191]  He wants to make Muslims wear identification.
[00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:38.753]  So he wants to follow the law, and he doesn't want
[00:05:39.233 --> 00:05:43.377]  ISIS infiltrators who have said they will come in with Syrian refugees.
[00:05:43.597 --> 00:05:44.898]  He wants to vet those people.
[00:05:45.018 --> 00:05:46.179]  That sounds crazy to me.
[00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:48.020]  Sounds like Hitler.
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.961]  Sounds like Hitler.
[00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:51.523]  Our ISIS is right here in America.
[00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:52.284]  No doubt about it.
[00:05:52.304 --> 00:05:54.286]  Our ISIS is right here in America.
[00:05:54.306 --> 00:05:55.787]  Okay, so what are we doing about it?
[00:05:56.027 --> 00:05:58.789]  If you watch the news, you'll see who our ISIS is.
[00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:59.630]  What are we doing about it?
[00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.891]  We can't start with this.
[00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:02.212]  What are we doing about it?
[00:06:02.232 --> 00:06:03.353]  We can't start with
[00:06:03.733 --> 00:06:04.794]  What are we doing about ISIS?
[00:06:04.834 --> 00:06:06.815]  This is not where this started.
[00:06:06.855 --> 00:06:08.036]  What are we doing about ISIS?
[00:06:08.396 --> 00:06:13.159]  ISIS is not... First of all, we have to start by saying who they are.
[00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:14.119]  In America, yes!
[00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:17.641]  Look at all the fucking... So then you didn't support the Iraqi war?
[00:06:17.881 --> 00:06:18.902]  No, we didn't support the Iraqi war.
[00:06:18.922 --> 00:06:20.063]  Neither did Donald Trump!
[00:06:20.083 --> 00:06:21.404]  ...everyday people, just like him.
[00:06:21.684 --> 00:06:21.844]  Oh, yes!
[00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:28.247]  Anyone else want to debate why Trump's a bad guy?
[00:06:28.327 --> 00:06:31.208]  Or do you just want to spew rhetoric about racism?
[00:06:31.288 --> 00:06:31.748]  Anyone!
[00:06:31.768 --> 00:06:33.429]  Well, he's already described what he is.
[00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:35.130]  We don't have to debate.
[00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.110]  Do you like Louis Farrakhan?
[00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.591]  Yes, I do.
[00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:38.851]  He endorsed Donald Trump!
[00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:40.992]  Said Donald Trump is the- Yes, he did, sir!
[00:06:41.292 --> 00:06:41.812]  Look it up!
[00:06:42.112 --> 00:06:43.453]  I challenge you right now!
[00:06:43.513 --> 00:06:46.154]  Louis Farrakhan has endorsed Donald Trump!
[00:06:46.194 --> 00:06:48.055]  That's just what I'm talking about!
[00:06:48.115 --> 00:06:48.635]  Uninformed!
[00:06:48.715 --> 00:06:49.335]  I am informed!
[00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:49.955]  Donald Trump!
[00:06:50.055 --> 00:06:50.636]  That's it!
[00:06:50.736 --> 00:06:51.916]  Owens, how you doing?
[00:06:51.936 --> 00:06:53.176]  Josh Owens, right?
[00:06:53.277 --> 00:06:54.377]  I met you in Ferguson.
[00:06:54.797 --> 00:06:55.718]  Yeah, I was there.
[00:06:55.738 --> 00:06:57.698]  Louis Vuitton has endorsed Donald Trump.
[00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.479]  Yes, this man is 100% wrong.
[00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:02.601]  Was you just not at the last event he spoke at?
[00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:04.701]  Were you not there?
[00:07:04.782 --> 00:07:13.545]  Donald Trump is the only candidate that has not taken money from those who keep us in the situation that we're in.
[00:07:13.645 --> 00:07:14.986]  And he also has endorsed Donald Trump.
[00:07:15.006 --> 00:07:18.688]  And he said that he is the best candidate to take America to hell.
[00:07:19.868 --> 00:07:22.109]  He said he endorsed Donald Trump, is what he said.
[00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:24.069]  And you said he didn't do that.
[00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:24.729]  I just didn't speak.
[00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:25.530]  You were just where?
[00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.110]  At Savior's Day.
[00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.051]  It's a big Muslim event.
[00:07:29.071 --> 00:07:30.651]  And what if Erdogan said that?
[00:07:30.691 --> 00:07:32.052]  He didn't say he endorsed Trump.
[00:07:32.072 --> 00:07:32.812]  I knew that much.
[00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:34.392]  But he has endorsed Donald Trump.
[00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:35.152]  I haven't heard that.
[00:07:35.172 --> 00:07:38.753]  Well, I'm giving you that news right now, and you just reject it.
[00:07:38.773 --> 00:07:39.754]  That's not credible.
[00:07:39.854 --> 00:07:40.594]  It's not credible.
[00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:43.535]  On record, on record, folks, on record.
[00:07:44.555 --> 00:07:52.405]  In an interview, a sit-down interview with a cameraman, with an interviewer, it's had millions of views, okay?
[00:07:52.926 --> 00:07:56.150]  Just because you haven't seen something doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
[00:07:56.771 --> 00:07:58.633]  Any other points against Trump?
[00:07:58.773 --> 00:08:00.195]  Anyone else want to debate me on Trump?
[00:08:00.215 --> 00:08:01.016]  This is too easy.
[00:08:01.036 --> 00:08:02.778]  Didn't think so.
[00:08:03.559 --> 00:08:04.259]  Didn't think so.
[00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:06.761]  Let's bring it back to black people being killed by police.
[00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:07.041]  Okay.
[00:08:07.201 --> 00:08:08.261]  What has Trump said about that?
[00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:09.942]  What about white people being killed by police?
[00:08:09.962 --> 00:08:11.443]  Fuck off!
[00:08:11.503 --> 00:08:12.923]  That's not racist though!
[00:08:13.144 --> 00:08:13.604]  Fuck off!
[00:08:13.664 --> 00:08:16.985]  If a white guy is killed by a policeman, only a black life matters.
[00:08:17.045 --> 00:08:25.109]  We already know that white people... That's not a fucking issue compared to the black people that are gunned down every single day by police.
[00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:27.590]  Gunned down every single day by police?
[00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:28.071]  Yes!
[00:08:28.111 --> 00:08:30.572]  You don't think that's built up by the mainstream media at all?
[00:08:32.294 --> 00:08:40.704]  Why aren't you guys in Chicago, where black people are killing black people?
[00:08:40.744 --> 00:08:46.571]  Why aren't you guys outside of Planned Parenthood, where black people are aborted by millions every year?
[00:08:49.293 --> 00:08:53.856]  What have you done to benefit this planet?
[00:08:53.996 --> 00:08:56.817]  I'm trying to awaken people.
[00:08:56.917 --> 00:08:58.458]  I'm trying to save freedom in the West.
[00:08:58.558 --> 00:08:59.939]  When was America great?
[00:08:59.959 --> 00:09:01.380]  What are you talking about?
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.122]  At what point in history are you talking about America great?
[00:09:06.182 --> 00:09:07.543]  I'm 26 years old and in my life
[00:09:12.465 --> 00:09:15.168]  I have seen a system of crony capitalism.
[00:09:15.188 --> 00:09:16.970]  I've never seen true capitalism.
[00:09:17.291 --> 00:09:19.173]  Maybe it will work, maybe it won't.
[00:09:19.233 --> 00:09:24.638]  But if we look at a case study of socialism and communism, it fails every time!
[00:09:25.219 --> 00:09:25.980]  Every time!
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.802]  And millions of people die!
[00:09:30.704 --> 00:09:34.446]  Okay, Mao Zedong, one of the biggest communists ever.
[00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:36.348]  Murdered people in the streets.
[00:09:36.368 --> 00:09:38.469]  Does Hitler not remind you of that?
[00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:40.390]  Does Trump not remind you of that?
[00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:46.533]  No, explain to me how Trump is like Hitler.
[00:09:46.593 --> 00:09:47.834]  Mass deportion.
[00:09:47.914 --> 00:09:50.315]  The list would be shorter if we had it.
[00:09:50.355 --> 00:09:51.956]  So obeying the law.
[00:09:52.296 --> 00:09:55.038]  Donald Trump wants to obey the laws on immigration.
[00:09:55.058 --> 00:09:58.660]  Donald Trump wants to- This country was founded on immigration!
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.983]  Legal immigrants, people who came here legally.
[00:10:02.063 --> 00:10:02.903]  Where does this stop?
[00:10:02.963 --> 00:10:04.504]  Because we're all immigrants.
[00:10:04.524 --> 00:10:05.785]  Where do you draw the line?
[00:10:05.825 --> 00:10:06.626]  We're all immigrants.
[00:10:06.646 --> 00:10:07.326]  So let's do it.
[00:10:07.346 --> 00:10:11.309]  So we're just going to, because something's happened in history, we can't make things better now.
[00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:12.630]  We can't live in reality.
[00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.051]  Oh, because illegal immigrants may have came here.
[00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:17.993]  Oh, because the Ku Klux Klan used to have reign in this country.
[00:10:18.113 --> 00:10:19.134]  We can't move forward.
[00:10:19.474 --> 00:10:22.076]  We can't move forward and act like people can be unified.
[00:10:22.536 --> 00:10:23.998]  Black people and white people can't be unified for Trump?
[00:10:24.018 --> 00:10:24.378]  That's bullcrap!
[00:10:24.398 --> 00:10:25.399]  Trump refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:25.439 --> 00:10:26.481]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:27.321]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:27.341 --> 00:10:28.162]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:28.182 --> 00:10:28.883]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:28.903 --> 00:10:29.584]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:29.604 --> 00:10:30.485]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:31.205]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:31.225 --> 00:10:32.126]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:32.146 --> 00:10:33.087]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:33.127 --> 00:10:34.028]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:34.068 --> 00:10:35.330]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:36.111]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:36.131 --> 00:10:37.432]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:37.472 --> 00:10:38.193]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:38.213 --> 00:10:38.974]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:38.994 --> 00:10:39.955]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:39.975 --> 00:10:40.695]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:40.715 --> 00:10:41.556]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:41.576 --> 00:10:42.678]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:42.698 --> 00:10:43.418]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:43.438 --> 00:10:44.059]  He refuses to denounce the KKK!
[00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:44.940]  He refuses to denounce the KKK
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:45.941]  You're damn right!
[00:10:45.961 --> 00:10:46.401]  You know why?
[00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:47.022]  You know why?
[00:10:47.162 --> 00:10:47.722]  You know why?
[00:10:47.862 --> 00:10:50.925]  You're spewing a lot of racist bullshit!
[00:10:51.005 --> 00:10:51.706]  You know why?
[00:10:51.746 --> 00:10:53.587]  You know why you're racist?
[00:10:53.647 --> 00:10:54.408]  Because you're not lying!
[00:10:54.628 --> 00:10:56.410]  Donald Trump said what I want to say!
[00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.191]  You know what I always heard y'all say?
[00:10:58.532 --> 00:11:00.293]  We want our country back!
[00:11:00.653 --> 00:11:01.154]  Bullshit!
[00:11:01.434 --> 00:11:02.255]  Black and white!
[00:11:02.475 --> 00:11:03.015]  Who said this?
[00:11:03.055 --> 00:11:09.499]  I dream of a country where people can be looked at by the character and not the color of their skin!
[00:11:09.539 --> 00:11:11.120]  That's not racist!
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:16.623]  Why do you want to divide people by race or what?
[00:11:16.683 --> 00:11:17.203]  A wall!
[00:11:18.024 --> 00:11:20.365]  Mexico has a wall on their southern border!
[00:11:20.445 --> 00:11:21.205]  Is that racist?
[00:11:22.726 --> 00:11:24.086]  It's 2016, not 1916!
[00:11:24.346 --> 00:11:27.287]  The good old white days are over with!
[00:11:27.307 --> 00:11:29.708]  The good old white days are over with!
[00:11:29.888 --> 00:11:31.648]  Ain't no more of them days, bruh!
[00:11:31.908 --> 00:11:32.508]  It's over!
[00:11:32.588 --> 00:11:34.088]  That's not racist!
[00:11:34.189 --> 00:11:35.089]  I'm racist though!
[00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:36.029]  I'm racist!
[00:11:36.089 --> 00:11:37.569]  That's not racist, I'm racist!
[00:11:37.689 --> 00:11:42.370]  You've never experienced oppression in your entire fucking life!
[00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.370]  Neither have I!
[00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.591]  You're fucking a white male!
[00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:47.993]  You're a white man!
[00:11:48.033 --> 00:11:51.696]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor!
[00:11:51.736 --> 00:11:52.497]  Bullshit!
[00:11:52.517 --> 00:11:52.797]  Bullshit!
[00:11:52.817 --> 00:11:55.019]  That's what Bernie Sanders said!
[00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:56.981]  That's what Bernie Sanders said!
[00:11:57.101 --> 00:11:59.723]  I state facts like Louie Farrakhan endorses Trump.
[00:11:59.963 --> 00:12:01.024]  They say it doesn't happen.
[00:12:01.104 --> 00:12:04.407]  I state facts like Bernie Sanders says white people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:12:04.427 --> 00:12:05.108]  They deny it.
[00:12:05.248 --> 00:12:06.609]  But they say I'm not informed.
[00:12:07.029 --> 00:12:09.972]  This is an illustration of what we're dealing with in this country.
[00:12:10.012 --> 00:12:12.293]  Now, fortunately, these people are really the minority.
[00:12:12.914 --> 00:12:15.976]  The silent majority has spoken for Trump in 2016.
[00:12:16.016 --> 00:12:23.502]  So when you're dealing with people like this, attacking you with low-level rhetoric and zero information, don't take it personally.
[00:12:23.682 --> 00:12:27.325]  When Trump wins in the polls, that's the majority speaking.
[00:12:27.365 --> 00:12:28.566]  We've been silent.
[00:12:28.786 --> 00:12:30.247]  We're not silent anymore.
[00:12:30.267 --> 00:12:34.271]  Donald Trump has people lying around the block of every race, color, creed, and age.
[00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:35.832]  No other candidate has that!
[00:12:36.252 --> 00:12:37.793]  Because he's an idiot, she says.
[00:12:38.274 --> 00:12:40.756]  Let's hear what you don't like about Trump, man.
[00:12:40.776 --> 00:12:43.078]  What don't you like about Donald Trump?
[00:12:43.238 --> 00:12:43.818]  I'm asking.
[00:12:43.838 --> 00:12:46.981]  He doesn't have the qualifications to be the president.
[00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:50.464]  Just because he has money doesn't mean he can be president.
[00:12:50.584 --> 00:12:52.485]  Alright, who does have the qualifications?
[00:12:53.446 --> 00:12:56.647]  Bernie Sanders didn't have a job until he was 40.
[00:12:56.727 --> 00:12:59.728]  Do you speak for Ferguson?
[00:12:59.788 --> 00:13:01.788]  Do you live in Ferguson?
[00:13:15.672 --> 00:13:16.953]  Hell yeah!
[00:13:17.334 --> 00:13:16.953]  63135.
[00:13:17.474 --> 00:13:19.275]  You want my address?
[00:13:19.496 --> 00:13:20.917]  You want to see my ID?
[00:13:21.017 --> 00:13:23.539]  And I've lived in Danville for 15 years.
[00:13:23.559 --> 00:13:25.081]  All my kids went to school.
[00:13:25.381 --> 00:13:26.082]  Graduated.
[00:13:26.202 --> 00:13:27.082]  Graduated.
[00:13:27.183 --> 00:13:27.763]  Graduated.
[00:13:27.803 --> 00:13:29.224]  Got a good job.
[00:13:29.364 --> 00:13:30.265]  Got a good job.
[00:13:30.285 --> 00:13:31.366]  I ain't no criminal.
[00:13:31.426 --> 00:13:33.688]  Can you tell me what happened in Ferguson?
[00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:35.190]  What happened in Ferguson?
[00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.411]  They got exposed.
[00:13:36.471 --> 00:13:37.272]  Who got exposed?
[00:13:37.532 --> 00:13:38.713]  The true racist community.
[00:13:42.456 --> 00:13:48.458]  Okay, so you're saying that the problem, Ferguson, wasn't the mainstream media blowing up a false narrative?
[00:13:48.538 --> 00:13:51.479]  No, it was the militarization of police!
[00:13:51.499 --> 00:13:57.060]  You can tell you are pure white, and I say that you have never experienced racism in your life.
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.961]  I'm experiencing racism right now!
[00:13:59.001 --> 00:14:01.962]  I'm experiencing racism right now!
[00:14:01.982 --> 00:14:03.922]  You're discounting my experience!
[00:14:03.962 --> 00:14:05.463]  The white guys are right!
[00:14:06.023 --> 00:14:08.124]  Oh my God, the white guys are right!
[00:14:08.204 --> 00:14:09.604]  How could that happen?
[00:14:10.044 --> 00:14:10.665]  Are you nuts?
[00:14:10.685 --> 00:14:11.646]  Completely!
[00:14:11.706 --> 00:14:12.086]  So what?
[00:14:12.167 --> 00:14:12.567]  I'm white!
[00:14:12.587 --> 00:14:12.887]  So what?
[00:14:12.987 --> 00:14:13.368]  I'm white!
[00:14:13.428 --> 00:14:15.010]  Why can't we just understand that?
[00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.932]  Hillary Clinton, a known liar.
[00:14:16.972 --> 00:14:20.435]  Bernie Sanders, the socialist who didn't have a job until he was 40.
[00:14:34.289 --> 00:14:37.471]  Donald Trump who's employed millions and millions of people.
[00:14:37.491 --> 00:14:38.332]  He's a racist!
[00:14:38.412 --> 00:14:39.332]  He's not a racist!
[00:14:39.412 --> 00:14:40.153]  He's not a racist!
[00:14:40.173 --> 00:14:41.213]  He's not a racist!
[00:14:41.253 --> 00:14:42.174]  He's not a racist!
[00:14:42.194 --> 00:14:43.154]  He's not a racist!
[00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:43.895]  He's not a racist!
[00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:51.840]  Yes, they did.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.682]  Because I looked up my family industry, that's how.
[00:14:54.762 --> 00:14:56.363]  They came from Germany.
[00:14:56.443 --> 00:14:57.404]  They came to Ellis Island.
[00:14:57.424 --> 00:15:01.167]  They had to wait for weeks because they had to be vetted for disease.
[00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:05.270]  I can tell you where my ancestors came from.
[00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:09.974]  I know where they came from because you don't know, but I know my grandparents were born slaves.
[00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:11.255]  So you don't know what I know.
[00:15:11.575 --> 00:15:16.299]  You know, my dad, my dad was born in 1918 on a plantation in Tallahassee, Florida.
[00:15:16.779 --> 00:15:18.640]  You don't know shit about racism.
[00:15:19.201 --> 00:15:20.682]  You don't know shit about racism.
[00:15:21.943 --> 00:15:43.832]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:15:50.308 --> 00:15:52.969]  Everybody got something to stand up and believe in than Diane.
[00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:57.212]  I will die before I elect Donald Trump to become President of the United States.
[00:15:57.432 --> 00:15:59.313]  Hillary Clinton will let people die in Benghazi.
[00:15:59.333 --> 00:15:59.813]  That's alright.
[00:15:59.853 --> 00:16:00.593]  Come on, get out of here.
[00:16:00.613 --> 00:16:01.654]  That's alright, okay.
[00:16:01.754 --> 00:16:02.775]  Benghazi, for real.
[00:16:02.915 --> 00:16:04.215]  Yeah, for real, it happened.
[00:16:04.395 --> 00:16:07.117]  I'm talking about right here in America, bruh.
[00:16:07.497 --> 00:16:09.938]  In America, we have control there.
[00:16:10.078 --> 00:16:12.320]  We don't got no control over in the country of Libya.
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.861]  Well, they don't even have no real, no established government there.
[00:16:14.901 --> 00:16:17.002]  They don't even have established government there.
[00:16:17.482 --> 00:16:25.227]  The system that you're complaining about starts with the politicians at the top who've been in office for decades.
[00:16:25.267 --> 00:16:29.729]  Donald Trump is the only one not from the insider class, not from the insider system.
[00:16:29.769 --> 00:16:30.370]  He's a racist.
[00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:30.790]  He's a racist.
[00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:31.851]  He's not a racist.
[00:16:31.891 --> 00:16:32.491]  He's a racist.
[00:16:32.531 --> 00:16:33.372]  He's a racist.
[00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:34.052]  He's a racist.
[00:16:34.092 --> 00:16:34.712]  He's a racist.
[00:16:34.752 --> 00:16:35.453]  He's a racist.
[00:16:35.493 --> 00:16:36.033]  He's a racist.
[00:16:36.093 --> 00:16:37.194]  He's a racist.
[00:16:37.314 --> 00:16:37.854]  He's a racist.
[00:16:37.974 --> 00:16:38.555]  He's a racist.
[00:16:38.615 --> 00:16:39.175]  He's a racist.
[00:16:41.076 --> 00:16:46.679]  Why did you do that to that white guy?
[00:16:46.719 --> 00:16:53.022]  Why did you do that to that black guy?
[00:16:53.122 --> 00:16:56.723]  Why did you do that to me?
[00:16:56.783 --> 00:16:58.004]  Why did you touch me?
[00:16:58.044 --> 00:17:00.285]  Don't you know I would have fucked you up?
[00:17:04.887 --> 00:17:07.328]  We're in the future!
[00:17:07.488 --> 00:17:09.049]  We're in the future!
[00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:11.030]  Bernie Sanders has nothing!
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.101]  Put your hands on me!
[00:17:30.161 --> 00:17:32.103]  Put your hands on me!
[00:17:32.703 --> 00:17:34.585]  Why you ain't touch one of the black guys?
[00:17:34.625 --> 00:17:37.387]  Touch one of these real front line protesters!
[00:17:37.427 --> 00:17:38.968]  Put your hands on me!
[00:17:39.028 --> 00:17:40.669]  I'm a real front line protester!
[00:17:44.452 --> 00:17:45.173]  All right.
[00:17:45.293 --> 00:17:45.953]  All right.
[00:18:11.828 --> 00:18:18.790]  I gotta say, I take my hat off to you, because you are the guy, this is the guy right here.
[00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:23.211]  Look around you right now, there's gotta be 150 people standing around.
[00:18:23.611 --> 00:18:26.651]  And it all started with this gentleman right here.
[00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:27.552]  Because I'm a leader.
[00:18:27.652 --> 00:18:31.573]  Because he walked through the crowd and he started viewing racism.
[00:18:32.133 --> 00:18:35.934]  And now the conversation's elevated to where we're at at this point.
[00:18:35.994 --> 00:18:37.774]  Black and white, you put your hands on him.
[00:18:38.234 --> 00:18:40.855]  There's a very important question.
[00:19:08.168 --> 00:19:09.309]  That needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.091]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.772 --> 00:19:15.754]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.434 --> 00:19:27.183]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type one civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.854 --> 00:19:39.220]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:50.126]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.097 --> 00:19:55.780]  And merging with artificial intelligence.
[00:19:56.521 --> 00:20:01.385]  So they're trying to end humanity as if it's a good thing and create this new species.
[00:20:01.705 --> 00:20:03.066]  Talk about mad scientists.
[00:20:03.686 --> 00:20:06.208]  And there have been several new articles on this just the last few weeks.
[00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:10.952]  DARPA is testing implantable chips in soldiers' brains, is one of them.
[00:20:11.393 --> 00:20:15.036]  Another just came out in mid-April.
[00:20:15.196 --> 00:20:16.197]  Rich Americans
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.382]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.842 --> 00:20:31.946]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.712]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.152 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:21:14.138]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription not just the chips are going to Be on the pills and medicines themselves But now you're going to have to give your blood at basically every time a tiny brick Into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on your body as well as your genes in this short report we're only scratching the surface and
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.985]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.626 --> 00:21:24.006]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.006 --> 00:21:26.707]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.607 --> 00:21:41.951]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
[00:21:42.831 --> 00:21:43.852]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.472 --> 00:21:45.193]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.613 --> 00:21:46.473]  All the television.
[00:21:46.594 --> 00:21:48.315]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.395 --> 00:21:50.236]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.556 --> 00:21:51.737]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.477 --> 00:21:54.158]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.719 --> 00:21:57.941]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.381 --> 00:22:04.085]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.665 --> 00:22:17.538]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.239 --> 00:22:19.781]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.221 --> 00:22:21.442]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.863 --> 00:22:23.244]  We do have that magic spark.
[00:22:24.125 --> 00:22:30.109]  But the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:46.680]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in Brain Force, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.

[00:22:57.427 --> 00:23:02.030]  So have you created any jobs?
[00:23:02.891 --> 00:23:04.111]  What jobs?
[00:23:04.131 --> 00:23:04.692]  Where you at?
[00:23:04.792 --> 00:23:06.453]  Why you... Give me the job right now!
[00:23:19.401 --> 00:23:21.943]  Give me the job right now!
[00:23:22.163 --> 00:23:23.904]  I have a used furniture company.
[00:23:24.104 --> 00:23:26.666]  I create furniture refinishing jobs.
[00:23:26.706 --> 00:23:27.867]  I have movers.
[00:23:28.067 --> 00:23:29.148]  I have assistant movers.
[00:23:29.248 --> 00:23:32.530]  I have people that do work for me.
[00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.651]  But what are movers doing for us?
[00:23:34.691 --> 00:23:39.955]  So for him to come to you here and see these programs, is he cutting the budget for education?
[00:23:39.975 --> 00:23:47.060]  No, I want... So why is he in a... This whole thing here is because of him being in debt.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:47.800]  Yes.
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:47.941]  Why?
[00:23:47.981 --> 00:23:49.563]  That's a fantastic New Jersey.
[00:23:49.603 --> 00:23:50.985]  Why is he in debt though?
[00:23:51.025 --> 00:23:52.366]  Why is he in debt though?
[00:23:52.386 --> 00:23:54.048]  Make America love again.
[00:23:54.089 --> 00:23:54.930]  Why is he in debt?
[00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:55.711]  I'll tell you why.
[00:23:55.731 --> 00:23:56.211]  Viva Mexico!
[00:23:56.271 --> 00:23:57.733]  I had to work my butt off.
[00:24:10.787 --> 00:24:15.229]  You know why?
[00:24:15.309 --> 00:24:17.490]  I will tell you why.
[00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:21.552]  Because they made federal loans available to students.
[00:24:21.973 --> 00:24:24.354]  The colleges said, oh, there's that money.
[00:24:25.074 --> 00:24:29.857]  I went to college for four years, graduated from the University of Wisconsin.
[00:24:30.117 --> 00:24:31.038]  It cost my parents $12,000.
[00:24:33.599 --> 00:24:35.640]  How many years ago was that?
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.580]  How many years ago was that?
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.101]  I owe $50,000.
[00:24:39.161 --> 00:24:43.722]  There's a lot of brands that people can take advantage of today.
[00:24:55.285 --> 00:25:01.932]  Why are our elementary school teachers who aren't helping shape our future tomorrow being paid less than they're supposed to be?
[00:25:01.972 --> 00:25:02.913]  Next to nothing!
[00:25:02.953 --> 00:25:03.753]  Next to nothing!
[00:25:03.773 --> 00:25:07.717]  They have to pay a second and third job!
[00:25:07.737 --> 00:25:11.581]  You're talking about New Jersey people who talk about being paid less than they're supposed to be!
[00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:11.981]  No f***ing way!
[00:25:19.568 --> 00:25:26.470]  There are so many unemployed teachers whose wages have gone down.
[00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:27.971]  Simple supply and demand.
[00:25:28.011 --> 00:25:34.414]  Now, if you're a nuclear physicist or you're a brain surgeon like... Who's the brain surgeon?
[00:25:34.494 --> 00:25:35.054]  Dr. Carson.
[00:25:38.355 --> 00:25:42.577]  I'll bet he makes a million and a half dollars a year because they're rare.
[00:25:42.617 --> 00:25:47.199]  But we're talking about New Jersey and him paying back stuff however much they're paying back.
[00:25:47.219 --> 00:25:50.060]  That's what I'm taking away from us New Jersey residents.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.120]  I was born and raised here.
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:51.960]  Wait a second.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.001]  I give back to my community.
[00:25:54.141 --> 00:25:55.162]  I do everything.
[00:25:55.222 --> 00:26:00.964]  I take care, and Chris Christie does not take care of the drug and alcohol epidemic that's going on in the state of New Jersey.
[00:26:01.004 --> 00:26:01.184]  Okay?
[00:26:01.204 --> 00:26:02.444]  Whatever you're getting, it's
[00:26:03.885 --> 00:26:04.746]  We're good to go.
[00:26:21.044 --> 00:26:21.904]  Well, I will tell you this.
[00:26:22.005 --> 00:26:24.226]  Anybody who takes drugs is a stupid troll.
[00:26:24.406 --> 00:26:26.387]  That's not right.
[00:26:26.467 --> 00:26:28.848]  I've never taken a drug a day of my life.
[00:26:29.528 --> 00:26:33.530]  Not too many people that use drugs are like my addicts.
[00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.872]  I've never had any type of drug addiction.
[00:26:37.012 --> 00:26:40.254]  People take drugs the same way they drink alcohol.
[00:26:40.894 --> 00:26:42.335]  It's not really a big problem.
[00:26:42.995 --> 00:26:43.275]  It's not.
[00:26:45.277 --> 00:26:47.259]  I'm American.
[00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:51.703]  I was born right here in the United States.
[00:26:51.984 --> 00:26:54.066]  You have some English accent with you.
[00:26:54.086 --> 00:26:56.008]  Yes, I do.
[00:26:56.148 --> 00:26:59.151]  I'm sorry if it was... What's wrong with having an accent?
[00:27:01.213 --> 00:27:04.957]  She's completely ignoring what I have to say.
[00:27:05.017 --> 00:27:07.279]  Why is there a problem with the harassment?
[00:27:07.419 --> 00:27:08.700]  I think it's great.
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:09.501]  Really, yeah.
[00:27:09.681 --> 00:27:10.642]  I know, it's great.
[00:27:10.682 --> 00:27:10.842]  Yeah.
[00:27:10.862 --> 00:27:11.263]  Cheers.
[00:27:11.303 --> 00:27:12.003]  Cheers.
[00:27:12.143 --> 00:27:12.704]  Pip and all that.
[00:27:12.744 --> 00:27:17.008]  You've got to have money in order to help yourself as a drug addict.
[00:27:17.028 --> 00:27:17.829]  You have to have money.
[00:27:17.849 --> 00:27:18.890]  You have to come for money.
[00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.510]  Okay?
[00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.233]  So what other drugs do you have to have money?
[00:27:22.253 --> 00:27:23.374]  How much are they?
[00:27:26.276 --> 00:27:27.217]  You're $5 back!
[00:27:27.317 --> 00:27:28.357]  You're $5 back now!
[00:27:28.377 --> 00:27:29.718]  $5 and poll wars!
[00:27:29.738 --> 00:27:30.538]  Love you guys!
[00:27:44.366 --> 00:27:46.289]  Wait, so Donald Trump promised you jobs?
[00:27:46.989 --> 00:27:47.750]  With what?
[00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:48.291]  With jobs?
[00:27:48.351 --> 00:27:50.874]  He said if he becomes president, we'll have more jobs.
[00:27:51.275 --> 00:27:56.201]  He's going to bring jobs back from other countries because they pay them nothing.
[00:27:56.382 --> 00:27:57.163]  It's slave labor.
[00:27:57.203 --> 00:27:59.426]  No, no, no, before you elaborate on the jobs.
[00:27:59.486 --> 00:28:01.228]  No, before you elaborate on your jobs.
[00:28:01.468 --> 00:28:03.230]  How is he going to do it?
[00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:05.751]  He's not putting a tariff on them!
[00:28:05.792 --> 00:28:09.795]  He's telling you his plan, but do you know, is he able to go through with his plan?
[00:28:09.855 --> 00:28:12.557]  Yeah, it is a fact that tariffs do work.
[00:28:12.657 --> 00:28:20.023]  You know, this country, before the income tax, this country, where there were no personal income taxes.
[00:28:20.943 --> 00:28:23.246]  There were only tariffs.
[00:28:23.666 --> 00:28:27.650]  And they paid... 1913 they did two things.
[00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:33.936]  They created the Federal Reserve and they created the personal income tax.
[00:28:33.996 --> 00:28:34.557]  So before that...
[00:28:36.278 --> 00:28:39.702]  Tariffs have always run this country.
[00:28:39.802 --> 00:28:44.586]  Now, you put 35% taxes on everything coming in from Mexico, and guess what?
[00:28:44.867 --> 00:28:48.510]  Companies are going to bring their jobs back here, rather than pay a 35% tariff.
[00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:49.811]  Well, that's their problem.
[00:28:49.951 --> 00:28:53.074]  But if we're giving them the jobs, what are they going to do?
[00:28:58.199 --> 00:29:00.120]  You know what?
[00:29:00.641 --> 00:29:03.522]  What the Mexican people have to do is do exactly what we did.
[00:29:03.562 --> 00:29:04.983]  Rise up and have a race of revolution.
[00:29:13.257 --> 00:29:13.898]  Okay, what's your name?
[00:29:14.358 --> 00:29:16.139]  Edward Fortune, the New Jersey weed man.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.882]  I'm actually running for Congress this year, so I'm out here getting signatures.
[00:29:20.383 --> 00:29:22.805]  I'm a big, big advocate for jury nullification.
[00:29:22.865 --> 00:29:30.031]  If you look up, uh, on InfoWars, you look up jury nullification, you'll see I did a couple interviews in the past, you know, about jury nullification.
[00:29:30.051 --> 00:29:31.652]  So, what do you think about Donald Trump?
[00:29:32.571 --> 00:29:33.291]  Fuck Donald Trump.
[00:29:34.412 --> 00:29:35.112]  No, you know what?
[00:29:35.292 --> 00:29:36.392]  I shouldn't have said it just like that.
[00:29:36.792 --> 00:29:39.333]  You know, I actually used to work for Donald Trump.
[00:29:39.393 --> 00:29:43.294]  I worked in Ivana Trump's restaurant for two years back in the 80s.
[00:29:44.014 --> 00:29:45.735]  I waited on Donald Trump all the time.
[00:29:45.855 --> 00:29:49.456]  Actually, if he wasn't running for president, I mean he's great for certain things.
[00:29:49.496 --> 00:29:49.876]  He's a great...
[00:29:50.396 --> 00:29:50.796]  We're good.
[00:30:10.339 --> 00:30:11.380]  The leader of the free world.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.922]  He has the button to push the nuclear bomb.
[00:30:13.982 --> 00:30:16.363]  He can start a war with Russia tomorrow.
[00:30:16.383 --> 00:30:18.084]  He can start a war with Korea.
[00:30:18.104 --> 00:30:19.165]  He can start a war.
[00:30:19.205 --> 00:30:21.347]  He can disrupt our allies.
[00:30:21.427 --> 00:30:26.570]  That's too much power for an irrational guy.
[00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:28.892]  And when I say irrational,
[00:30:30.754 --> 00:30:36.701]  You know, I'm actually guilty of being very similar to him because I do things off the cuff and I do things at the moment.
[00:30:36.741 --> 00:30:41.266]  And sometimes I go back and wish I had time to take that back or to do it a different way.
[00:30:41.727 --> 00:30:49.015]  But when you're talking about he has the power of the most powerful military in the world, he would be in control of
[00:30:49.502 --> 00:30:53.264]  This is the second or third largest economy in the world.
[00:30:53.805 --> 00:30:57.107]  You know, our currency system is the world's currency system.
[00:30:57.487 --> 00:31:00.609]  You can have this man in charge of all that.
[00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:03.971]  And give him the option to pick a Supreme Court Justice?
[00:31:04.212 --> 00:31:05.692]  Oh my God, no way!
[00:31:08.094 --> 00:31:13.998]  Alright, so if we're going to get specific, just specifically his policies, his ideas, what do you dislike the most?
[00:31:15.405 --> 00:31:16.266]  I think it's a divider.
[00:31:16.286 --> 00:31:19.510]  This is the United States of America.
[00:31:20.291 --> 00:31:28.460]  I admit, we're not quite as united as we should be, but putting Donald Trump in charge of America would be divisive.
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.083]  It would be dividing the United States.
[00:31:32.604 --> 00:31:35.147]  So you know the DNC is close by in Philly.
[00:31:37.543 --> 00:31:44.790]  I went to the Republican convention in 2000 and I didn't think I'd ever see a convention come to Philly again.
[00:31:45.191 --> 00:31:46.532]  So this is great.
[00:31:47.013 --> 00:31:48.114]  It's a Democratic convention.
[00:31:48.414 --> 00:31:49.795]  I think it's going to be a lot of turmoil.
[00:31:50.396 --> 00:31:52.859]  I am a burning for Bernie guy.
[00:31:53.619 --> 00:31:57.504]  I believe in Bernie's message and I'm sorry Hillary
[00:31:59.016 --> 00:31:59.737]  Lost me.
[00:32:00.519 --> 00:32:03.023]  Her adherence to Bill Clinton's 1995 crime bill, 1993 crime bill.
[00:32:08.695 --> 00:32:09.776]  You know, super predators.
[00:32:10.196 --> 00:32:15.962]  You know, we talk about Harry Angzinger, Richard Nixon, but you know what?
[00:32:16.282 --> 00:32:23.048]  The greatest increase in prison population actually occurred under Bill Clinton's watch.
[00:32:23.609 --> 00:32:25.010]  And she was down with it.
[00:32:25.771 --> 00:32:29.434]  She can't unsign her name or divorce herself from that political issue.
[00:32:29.884 --> 00:32:31.065]  She never even divorced him.
[00:32:31.365 --> 00:32:34.527]  She can't divorce herself from his political policies, you know?
[00:32:34.787 --> 00:32:44.613]  And she is strapped to the 1993 crime bill, you know, where us so-called super predators were residing.
[00:32:46.654 --> 00:32:47.095]  Oh my God.
[00:32:47.115 --> 00:32:53.138]  I can go on and on and on about the war on drugs and how Bill Clinton's policies helped it.
[00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:55.360]  She's strapped to it.
[00:33:02.338 --> 00:33:11.540]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important area of InfoWars that runs the whole operation that is having such a big effect against the globalists.
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:19.981]  And I've said it over and over again, it is you the listeners and the viewers that send us the intel, the news tips, that support the broadcast, that spread the word.
[00:33:20.882 --> 00:33:23.982]  You are 90% of the operation or more.
[00:33:24.022 --> 00:33:27.183]  You don't stand beside us, you stand at the heart of InfoWars.
[00:33:27.563 --> 00:33:28.443]  When I talk about the people,
[00:33:28.803 --> 00:33:31.285]  And in full, we're from customer service, the shipping department.
[00:33:31.445 --> 00:33:38.610]  Being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.211 --> 00:33:44.534]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.955 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.881]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLife.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.
[00:33:57.321 --> 00:34:05.643]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when products are sold out, you're unable to get them, sometimes for months, but we hold back the products for people that have already signed up for AutoShip.

[00:34:29.474 --> 00:34:30.494]  Now it's finally here.
[00:34:30.954 --> 00:34:34.455]  AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:34:34.775 --> 00:34:35.255]  It's easy.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.833]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.093 --> 00:35:32.537]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.797 --> 00:35:33.197]  We're good to go.
[00:35:54.045 --> 00:36:01.887]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.047 --> 00:36:07.468]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.488 --> 00:36:11.029]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.189 --> 00:36:15.190]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:19.191]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:14.897 --> 00:37:25.624]  Are you teaching your kids to be rapists?
[00:37:26.738 --> 00:37:30.879]  Jakari Jackson reporting from Albuquerque, New Mexico, outside of the Trump rally.
[00:37:30.899 --> 00:37:33.280]  Trump is set to speak in about an hour from now.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:38.361]  But as you can see right now, there's a large group of anti-Trump demonstrators.
[00:37:38.381 --> 00:37:43.882]  Let's go ahead and take a walk down here and see if maybe we can get a word with a few of the folks who came out here.
[00:37:44.503 --> 00:37:46.063]  Now this is the anti-Trump side.
[00:37:46.083 --> 00:37:48.384]  There is a pro-Trump side, which is back that way.
[00:37:48.404 --> 00:37:50.284]  We'll try to get over there in just a little bit.
[00:37:51.084 --> 00:37:53.745]  Let's get a little bit closer here and see if we can take a look at some of the signs.
[00:37:57.745 --> 00:37:59.246]  Sir, this guy has a very sensational sign.
[00:37:59.486 --> 00:38:01.787]  Sir, do you mind if I ask you what brought you out here today?
[00:38:02.448 --> 00:38:04.389]  The First Amendment right to protest.
[00:38:04.929 --> 00:38:07.130]  Alright, let me take a look at your shirt and at your sign here.
[00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:12.293]  So you got the F Trump shirt and also Trump for KKK or KKK for Trump.
[00:38:12.333 --> 00:38:13.994]  What is your beef with Donald Trump?
[00:38:14.414 --> 00:38:17.436]  Well, number one, I think he's a manifestation of the media.
[00:38:17.776 --> 00:38:21.258]  I mean, we have a reality star that's running for president.
[00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:22.219]  I mean, who's next?
[00:38:22.279 --> 00:38:24.180]  Kim Kardashian or Justin Bieber?
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.020]  That's pathetic.
[00:38:25.101 --> 00:38:25.761]  I mean, it really is.
[00:38:26.241 --> 00:38:29.547]  And I mean, he says anything just to pander to any crowd.
[00:38:29.828 --> 00:38:35.878]  So he's at Liberty University and he quotes Corinthians 2 or whatever, you know, so I mean...
[00:38:37.102 --> 00:38:40.404]  As far as policy, what's his policies that you can't get with?
[00:38:41.445 --> 00:38:51.591]  Well, I know that he'd revert back to the essence of tax cuts for the wealthiest, cutting trade embargoes, shipping out jobs.
[00:38:51.671 --> 00:38:55.813]  I mean, he says he's for American jobs, but all of his clothes that's made is made in China.
[00:38:55.873 --> 00:38:57.794]  So he's a hypocrite when it comes to that standpoint.
[00:39:00.097 --> 00:39:00.237]  Alright.
[00:39:00.417 --> 00:39:00.897]  Anything else?
[00:39:01.138 --> 00:39:01.838]  I don't know.
[00:39:01.858 --> 00:39:02.798]  There's plenty of other things.
[00:39:03.159 --> 00:39:13.404]  His xenophobia, his racism, overt racism, and not being able to walk away from David Duke or any other white supremacist that endorsed him.
[00:39:14.825 --> 00:39:16.526]  And the violence that's taking place at his rallies.
[00:39:17.586 --> 00:39:20.368]  I will challenge you on that point.
[00:39:20.408 --> 00:39:24.551]  We've seen people like Hillary be endorsed by Klan members as well.
[00:39:25.131 --> 00:39:25.852]  I agree with that.
[00:39:25.872 --> 00:39:30.114]  Those are just trolls, really.
[00:39:30.134 --> 00:39:32.756]  If you look at the history, because I teach history.
[00:39:33.757 --> 00:39:37.579]  Conservatives opposed the Declaration of Independence because they didn't want to give up their power.
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.441]  F*** Donald Trump.
[00:39:39.901 --> 00:39:42.803]  So, but you look at the civil rights area, who is opposed to it?
[00:39:43.043 --> 00:39:43.564]  Conservatives.
[00:39:43.584 --> 00:39:44.805]  Who opposed to free and slavery?
[00:39:45.085 --> 00:39:45.645]  Conservatives.
[00:39:45.906 --> 00:39:48.287]  Who is opposed to allowing women to vote?
[00:39:48.728 --> 00:39:49.348]  Conservatives.
[00:39:49.368 --> 00:39:50.009]  Okay?
[00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:54.712]  So, paying for, you know, public education, they try to dismantle public education.
[00:39:54.752 --> 00:39:56.714]  I'm a public school and public education teacher.
[00:39:57.074 --> 00:39:58.635]  And they're constantly trying to dismantle it.
[00:39:58.915 --> 00:40:00.456]  They've tried the idea of vouchers.
[00:40:00.796 --> 00:40:01.957]  Now they have charter schools.
[00:40:02.057 --> 00:40:03.358]  All it does is hurt education.
[00:40:03.658 --> 00:40:06.560]  I mean, it's... And I teach this in my world history class.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.941]  It's the movie Bug's Life.
[00:40:08.001 --> 00:40:09.542]  It's the ants versus the grasshoppers.
[00:40:09.822 --> 00:40:13.925]  The problem is, is you get people to think that they're grasshoppers, but they're really ants.
[00:40:16.045 --> 00:40:20.666]  I like some of the things that you guys do on Infowars, but I think some of it can be a little bit lunacy.
[00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:34.089]  I listen to some of the things that you do, and I believe a lot of the things, but at the end of the day, Hillary's going to appoint a Supreme Court Justice, possibly up to four, that's better for America.
[00:40:34.149 --> 00:40:39.490]  Better for workers, better for my son, better for the air that they breathe, the water that they drink.
[00:40:40.404 --> 00:40:40.624]  Okay.
[00:40:41.085 --> 00:40:46.073]  So in the end, okay, yes, President Obama's gone, but he appointed two Supreme Court justices.
[00:40:46.374 --> 00:40:48.978]  He's going to recess, appoint a third to protect Hillary.
[00:40:49.058 --> 00:40:49.659]  He really is.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.181]  So, I mean, so.
[00:41:43.757 --> 00:41:44.577]  There he is, Tear Gas!
[00:41:44.617 --> 00:41:46.819]  You guys know I don't like that stuff.
[00:41:47.439 --> 00:41:51.821]  You just have to cool it down.
[00:41:51.861 --> 00:41:52.762]  What's going on, man?
[00:41:52.822 --> 00:41:54.863]  Bro, you just hit me with a freakin' rock!
[00:41:54.883 --> 00:41:56.203]  What's your name, bro?
[00:41:56.263 --> 00:41:57.964]  You just hit me with a rock!
[00:41:58.004 --> 00:41:58.104]  You!
[00:41:58.224 --> 00:41:58.504]  Yeah, you!
[00:42:06.048 --> 00:42:09.030]  You guys just hit me with a freakin' rock!
[00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:11.411]  There you go, man.
[00:42:12.331 --> 00:42:13.392]  Now I got the tear gas in my lungs.
[00:42:20.115 --> 00:42:20.215]  Yeah.
[00:42:20.235 --> 00:42:20.395]  Yeah.
[00:42:53.273 --> 00:42:55.278]  What the f**k is this?
[00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:19.731]  All right, so we're outside the Trump event.
[00:43:19.811 --> 00:43:20.552]  It just wrapped up.
[00:43:20.692 --> 00:43:24.353]  Well, it wrapped up a while ago, but probably about 20 minutes ago, they shot the tear gas off.
[00:43:24.373 --> 00:43:26.974]  We talked to this gentleman, and he wants to tell us his thoughts on it.
[00:43:27.154 --> 00:43:31.996]  The only reason that they started shooting tear gas at us is because an old man was pushed by a police officer.
[00:43:32.116 --> 00:43:33.717]  I asked, let him pass.
[00:43:33.877 --> 00:43:34.377]  Let him walk away.
[00:43:34.397 --> 00:43:34.897]  He had the cane.
[00:43:35.097 --> 00:43:36.998]  No, he hits him in the face for no apparent reason.
[00:43:37.438 --> 00:43:41.260]  When Donald Trump showed up, look how heavy in hate he brought here.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:47.982]  I stand for people, our armed services, our men and women in uniform.
[00:43:48.442 --> 00:43:51.763]  We're supposed to stand united, but he brings division.
[00:43:52.063 --> 00:43:52.884]  He brings hatred.
[00:43:53.444 --> 00:43:55.025]  We're supposed to stand united, aren't we?
[00:43:55.405 --> 00:43:58.046]  Aren't we all Americans?
[00:43:58.806 --> 00:44:00.766]  Our liberty is supposed to be uphold.
[00:44:01.107 --> 00:44:04.508]  Our Constitution is supposed to be held in the strongest of set
[00:44:05.288 --> 00:44:06.888]  I'm challenging you here for one second.
[00:44:07.108 --> 00:44:09.249]  I'm not a Donald Trump supporter at all, but I'm going to say this to you.
[00:44:09.689 --> 00:44:11.429]  Donald Trump didn't set any trash can fire.
[00:44:11.469 --> 00:44:12.589]  Donald Trump didn't throw any rocks.
[00:44:13.049 --> 00:44:14.810]  All the other stuff you've seen out here, he did not do that.
[00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:22.431]  The reason that, yeah, the fire started earlier, but when that man was attacked by a police officer, that incited violence.
[00:44:22.971 --> 00:44:26.352]  Obviously, they brought it when they attacked that innocent man.
[00:44:26.992 --> 00:44:29.352]  Now, what the **** is that supposed to be about, my bad?
[00:44:29.393 --> 00:44:30.153]  Excuse my language.
[00:44:30.213 --> 00:44:30.473]  Yes, sir.
[00:44:32.493 --> 00:44:37.037]  Look it, we're supposed to protect foreign domestic, but they're domestic here.
[00:44:37.237 --> 00:44:39.059]  They're bringing domestic terrorism to us.
[00:44:39.159 --> 00:44:39.899]  We're all Americans.
[00:44:39.919 --> 00:44:42.061]  We have the free to stand where we please.
[00:44:42.482 --> 00:44:43.342]  We're not sheep.
[00:44:43.983 --> 00:44:44.924]  We're not slaves.
[00:44:45.304 --> 00:44:46.605]  Oh my bad.
[00:44:46.825 --> 00:44:48.907]  And you know, we're supposed to stand.
[00:44:49.688 --> 00:44:50.588]  Look at what they're trying to do.
[00:44:50.608 --> 00:44:52.390]  They're trying to force us on our knees.
[00:44:53.351 --> 00:44:55.192]  American was founded on revolution.
[00:44:55.793 --> 00:44:56.913]  We're founded on immigrants.
[00:44:57.932 --> 00:44:58.993]  George Washington!
[00:44:59.433 --> 00:45:00.513]  We should take example!
[00:45:00.814 --> 00:45:01.614]  Abraham Lincoln!
[00:45:01.934 --> 00:45:02.454]  Patton!
[00:45:02.855 --> 00:45:04.536]  They fought for this country, didn't they?
[00:45:04.996 --> 00:45:06.477]  Didn't they do any good?
[00:45:07.177 --> 00:45:08.037]  We must act!
[00:45:08.498 --> 00:45:09.678]  We must stand united!
[00:45:12.019 --> 00:45:18.183]  And I'm not sure how, if at all, the anti-Trump demonstrators helped their cause tonight.
[00:45:18.911 --> 00:45:32.254]  I'm by no means a Donald Trump supporter, but if I was to watch a video of people yelling and cussing at old women and little kids, that's not somebody I would want to team up with.
[00:45:32.354 --> 00:45:33.415]  Just vile rhetoric.
[00:45:33.475 --> 00:45:41.036]  And people talk about Donald Trump's racism, yeah he said a bunch of controversial stuff, but I've seen people just say the most hateful things.
[00:45:42.197 --> 00:45:45.658]  Whether it's Hispanic to Hispanic, or white to white.
[00:45:48.047 --> 00:45:52.170]  Whatever else was attacking people on their physical appearance.
[00:45:52.210 --> 00:46:01.496]  Just, you know, all manner of childishness, you know, like being a 13 year old or a 13 year old, uh, lunch room with a bunch of kids, you know, that's pretty much how it was.
[00:46:02.136 --> 00:46:07.840]  And I have to say, I did not see any Donald Trump supporters acting vile or vicious.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:12.263]  Everybody I talked to was very polite.
[00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:19.836]  Even if I didn't agree with all their policies, they could explain why they felt that way in a very eloquent manner.
[00:46:20.196 --> 00:46:33.329]  And I found some anti-Trump people that could do so as well, but the number of Trump people that could speak their mind eloquently was much higher than the people I spoke to who opposed Donald Trump.
[00:46:34.048 --> 00:46:38.549]  Yelled and cursed and, you know, F this and, you know, you do that with your mother.
[00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:40.270]  All that kind of stuff.
[00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:45.672]  It's a little crazy, but this is what happens when Donald Trump comes to a Latin nation.
[00:46:46.292 --> 00:46:49.033]  But also, we're in New Mexico, so let's get this straight.
[00:46:49.273 --> 00:46:50.473]  We're not in Mexico.
[00:46:51.133 --> 00:46:51.993]  We're New Mexico.
[00:46:52.034 --> 00:46:53.034]  We're above Mexico.

[00:47:07.611 --> 00:47:09.794]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.914 --> 00:47:16.721]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:47:16.941 --> 00:47:20.225]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.245 --> 00:47:21.406]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.707 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.094]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.334 --> 00:47:29.255]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.275 --> 00:47:33.260]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:36.643]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.684 --> 00:47:39.707]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.787 --> 00:47:41.248]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.288 --> 00:47:46.992]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:47:47.032 --> 00:47:52.195]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.

[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.366 --> 00:48:19.110]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:23.132]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.712 --> 00:48:28.374]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.774 --> 00:48:34.997]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.318 --> 00:48:37.599]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:48:38.259 --> 00:48:40.700]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:46.583]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:48:47.023 --> 00:48:53.688]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.

[00:49:20.253 --> 00:49:22.514]  Here it goes.
[00:49:22.694 --> 00:49:31.916]  Alright, they've broken open the barrier and they're going inside.
[00:49:32.056 --> 00:49:32.816]  Excuse me?
[00:49:32.897 --> 00:49:33.477]  Excuse me?
[00:49:49.477 --> 00:49:51.058]  Alright, they said they were going to be arrested.
[00:49:51.078 --> 00:49:57.744]  Got people being triggered.
[00:49:58.824 --> 00:50:01.146]  So there's a mass of people up at the front.
[00:50:01.166 --> 00:50:01.927]  Walk forward!
[00:50:01.947 --> 00:50:05.169]  Looks like they're coming forward now.
[00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:07.511]  Let's walk forward!
[00:50:07.751 --> 00:50:07.892]  Push!
[00:50:07.912 --> 00:50:08.092]  Push!
[00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:21.131]  So they're at the front right now, you can see them.
[00:50:45.444 --> 00:50:46.525]  So they massed around there.
[00:50:46.565 --> 00:50:48.046]  Nobody's gotten into the hotel yet.
[00:50:58.894 --> 00:51:01.517]  People are listening to the police at this point.
[00:51:01.537 --> 00:51:02.717]  Half of them.
[00:51:16.459 --> 00:51:17.059]  Well, here it is.
[00:51:17.079 --> 00:51:19.101]  Looks like they are storming the gates at this point.
[00:51:26.946 --> 00:51:38.193]  Hey, um, I'm with the media.
[00:51:38.233 --> 00:51:42.415]  I don't want to get... Not a pass to get inside, but... You gotta stay here?
[00:51:42.495 --> 00:51:42.716]  Okay.
[00:51:44.517 --> 00:51:44.797]  Hey!
[00:51:47.156 --> 00:51:51.937]  If somebody pushes me into you, just don't knock me in the face.
[00:52:07.181 --> 00:52:09.702]  So the cops have pushed him back now from the front entrance.
[00:52:10.728 --> 00:52:11.829]  They pushed some people down.
[00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:18.193]  They're using their, uh... They're throwing eggs now.
[00:52:18.213 --> 00:52:19.534]  I've seen a few eggs being thrown.
[00:52:20.034 --> 00:52:21.615]  People are going through the hedgerows right now.
[00:52:28.873 --> 00:52:48.204]  All right, they're throwing eggs and they're pushing the protesters back at this time now.
[00:52:52.033 --> 00:53:03.485]  You see they're pushing them back in, back into the street.
[00:53:15.575 --> 00:53:17.777]  Then we'll sweep you aside like the rest of you.
[00:53:17.797 --> 00:53:17.857]  Yep.
[00:53:17.897 --> 00:53:18.237]  Yep, yep.
[00:53:18.297 --> 00:53:18.878]  Back up, back up.
[00:53:18.898 --> 00:53:19.439]  Get down, back up!
[00:53:19.599 --> 00:53:20.519]  Get down, back up!
[00:53:20.539 --> 00:53:20.840]  Fuck you!
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:21.180]  Back up!
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:21.921]  Back up!
[00:53:21.961 --> 00:53:22.301]  Back up!
[00:53:22.341 --> 00:53:22.762]  Back up!

[00:57:20.635 --> 00:57:23.536]  We just represent slavery!
[00:57:23.716 --> 00:57:24.757]  Colonialism!
